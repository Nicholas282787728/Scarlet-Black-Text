December 2, 1988

by Matt Macho
I was sitting in the lounge
late last night playing "Nuclear
Escalation." Someone had just
nuked me with a twenty megaton
warhead,“ I lost eleven million
people as my cities were trans-
formed into rubble. “Anyone got
change for twenty million peo»
ple?" I asked, to the bemusement
of my enemies. Someone walked
'n, took one look at the game in
progress, and shouted, "Oh God,
you people are really sick!" but
we‘re too busy laughing hysterir
cally at my retaliatory strike to
take notice.
In a roundabout way, all
this made me think of this movie
saw a couple of years ago,
Robacop. It's this black comedy
set in a corporatedominated fu-
ture world ridden with crime and
ar —— the game "Nuke»em" is a
top seller. Corporations run ev-
erything, even law enforcement --
Ayn Rand would be proud.

This one cop is shot in the
head and killed. but brought back
to life as a cyborg-robot supercop
w hence the title of the movie.
It's great fun watching the may-
hem as Robocop wastes various
felons, a la dirty Harry. But the
Robocop has those nagging fcelr
ings that he's not a machine ., he
vaguely remembers a family, and
being shot. The company turns
out to be incredibly corrupt (nice
to see that some things, at least.
never change); and eventually, of
course, Robocop discovers what
the corporation did to him and
wastes all the Corrupt sleazcbags
in the company who did him
wrong (Grinnell Yuppies, take
notice).

Lots of action, with bits of
sick humor thrown in, make for
great fun for the whole family.

SCARLET AND BLACK

House of
Games:

gripping,
tough to top

by Scott Bemberg

House of Gurney stands
apart from tnost major film re-
leases of the past five years.
What separates it from other
psychological thrillers such as
Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction
is the powerful direction and
screenplay of David Mamet. Add
to this Mamet's pct project, the
vastly underrated actor, Joe Man-
Iegna, and you have the ingredi-
ents for a gripping ﬁlm.

Set in San Francisco,
House of Games is more a char-
acter study than a simple thriller.
A psychologist (Linda Krouse)
who works with obsessive-com-
pulsive patients becomes in-
volved with u too-slick con artist
(Mantegna). As the two grow
closer, the plot drags the viewer
into the film. It is almost as if
there is something about
Mamet’s direction that draws our
eyes to the screen.

Mamet’s message, "Maybe
doctor and patient aren't so differ
ent after all," comes across beau-
tifully as the plot begins to unr
fold. Is the psychoanalyst work-
ing with the sick and troubled so
different from the con man alr
ways on the move for a hustle?

House of Game: was un-
justly snubbed at the Academy
Awards last year. Mamet‘s work
on the screen will no doubt soon
be recognized as among the best
in Hollywood today. His first
script, The Untouchables. proved
he could make the shift from
stage to screen and his latest
film, Things Change, also star
ring Mantegna, is a good effort
on a smaller scale. Ilourc of
Games however, will be tough to
top, Sec it. Trust Me.

They Died With Their Boots On

by Georgia Dentel

The American Frontier
Film Series concludes on Mon
day, Dec. 5, with They Died
With Their Boot: 0h. Errol
Flynn and Olivia de Havilland
star in this historical western
which follows General George
Custer from his days at West
Point to his encounter with Chief
Sitting Bull at the Battle of the
Little Big Horn. Custer‘s flam»
hoyant style is entertainingly

presented by the actor perhaps
best suited to portray it (Flynn),
although the characterization it-
self is thought by some to be too
sympathetic a portrait of Custer.
Those interested in details
of the Little Big Horn Battle and
Ihcjoumalistic style ofthe period
are referred to accounts of the
battle presented on the front page
of the New York Time: in 1876.

So begins this film, which

from these two films, as well as
his own past work, for both the
structuring of the plot and cine-

to prove what actually happened
