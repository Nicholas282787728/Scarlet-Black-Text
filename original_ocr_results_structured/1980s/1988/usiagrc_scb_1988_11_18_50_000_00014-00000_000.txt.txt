team
reaps
rewards

by Bob Liflon

Honors, honors, honors!
While the season is over and done
with, the men's soccer team is
being recognized for its highly
successl‘ul years And with due
causer

First and foremost, the
team as a whole takes center
stage. The '88 squad racked up an
extremely impressive 10-3-1
record, the best in the school‘s
history. placing them 8th in the
West region at year's end Not
too shabby, huh’l

When individual awards
came out last week. Pioneer
playcrs went home with a hand
full No less than ﬁve made ﬁrst
team all»conference: senior co~
captains Brad Bisgard and Randy
Secley; senior KJr Noll; junior
Torn McCulIen and sophomore
Ian Lorimcr, Achieving second-
team recognition was junior
Austin Simmons who led the the
team in scoring with nine goals.
Noll and Lorimer tied for second
with tour apiece.

In the wake of these
"outside" awards, the Pioneers
themselves handed out some
noteworthy presents, McCullcn
got the “big one." capturing the
team‘s most valuable player
honor, Rookie/newcomer of the
year went to Erich Giebelhaus,
while most improved went to ju-
nior John Stillmanr

It's nice to know Lhat oth-
ers outside the Grinnell commu—
nity took notice of this year's
team. They will deﬁnitely go
down in the books as one of the
great ones of all time, which is
precisely as it should be.

What's happened to college

athletics?

Continued from page 16

Bond, cltlwu in Arizona, [or ex.
ample, is using all its bargain»
ing power to land Notre Dame
(right now 1) against number
4 West Virginia, hoping heyong
hope that neither gets upset in
tire remaining weeks 7 an odds-
agninst gamble in today's col
lege game in which top twenty
teams

always seem to fall by the ways
side — so as to detract from its
potential tltnrltetiltg power.

The beauty [or irony) of it
all is the irrelevuucy of all these
“howls." There is at how]
for practically everything nowae
days, You ﬁnish even a Cour
pie over .500 7 providing your
one or the scarcalled “big boys"
— and you’ll more than lilrely
be spending some portion or
your winter vacation in some
onla the way place playing one
other still—pat team in sortie bowl
named after a fruit. It’s at,
most worse that the NHL playe
oﬂ‘s! What otl earth do these
“bowls" mean, anyway? It‘s not
at. all like the Super Bowl, ill
which the best. team otthal year
is crowned. Nor does it resent-
lllc collcge hrtslrethztlls' luurnar
ment in which a national champ
eventually emerges. But hey,
there‘s plenty of Ilaliolml cot/e
ernge which lltenns huelcs, big
bucks at that. Anti while money
may not always buy a ticket to
happiness, it sure does these col.
lege programs a whole lot or
good.

Sure, there are undoubtedly
other dilemmas surrounding cole
legiul athletics, such as the ris-
ing drug problem. The story
of South Carolina defensive and
Tommy ('huikeu and his losing
bout to steroids is n ruse in
point. It unfortunately took ex~
Maryland basketball great Len
nias's death to open a few peo~
ple‘s eyes to the dsmage drugs
aer doing to some of our corin-
lry's ﬁnest athletes. But these
and numerous other devasting
problems all feed into the satire
black whole: protessionsl sports.

Be it the NFL. NBA, MBL(
major league baseball] or even
the NHL, college athletics all ﬁle
ter in to the ever-growing melt
ing pot or pro ball. Again colr
lege toothall is the most ap
propriate example. Division [
players are going into a tour
(mostly five) year football pIOr
gram, not it tour year university.
