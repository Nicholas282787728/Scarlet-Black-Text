Discordianism hits the Grinnell campus

Students worship the Greek goddess of discord

by John Newmark
. Presently Esdras VP is liv-
ing in a student's post ofﬁce box
here in Grinnell, Living in post
office boxes is a power given
only to adherents to Discordian
Zen. While he nonnally lives in
the post ofﬁce box, 1 was able to
talk to him for an hour Wednes»
day night in Norris Lounge. I
.originally thought the person I
was talking with was the owner
of the box, but he informed me
that actually the owner was en—
tirely unconnected with Discor-
dianisrrt, he was just living in his
post office box. and dtus he asked
me not to include the guy's name
in this article. Esdras VP. during
our brief discussion. talked about
the history of Discordianism,
some of it's beliefs, and about
related activities here on campus.
In the 1950's Malaclypse

vision of the Greek Goddess Eris
in a bowling alley. Eris's Ro-
man counterpart was named Dis-
cordia. Long before the vision,
the ﬁrst party ever was held on
Mount Olympus. It was a wed-
ding party. to which all the gods
and goddesses were invited. ex-
cept Eris. This is known as "The
Original Snub." Eris did not go
to the party, but she did send a
golden apple with the word
"Kallisti" written on it, which
means "To the most beautiful
one" in Greek. Hera, Athena, and
Aphrodite fought over who was
the most beauulul. Zeus, being
infinitely wise, chose a human

named Paris to judge whom was
most beautiful. Being a mere
human. Paris naturally couldn't
decide, so he was bribed by the
three goddesses. Aphrodite otteted
Helen to Paris, and indirectly
started the Trojan War, Esdras

the Episcopos of the "We're
Beatrice" Cabal of the Parathea-
Anametamystikhood of Eris
Esoteric (POEE). He has a
brother named Gula Cthulhu who
is like a membrane which sepa~
rates the chaos outside from the
chaos inside. Esdras said that he
might have had that confused
with his old Windbreaker.
Whether Gula Cthulhu is also
living in a student's mailbox was

In the 1950's Malaclypse the younger and Lord
Omar had a vision of the Greek Goddess Eris in a

bowling alley.

What is Discordian Zen?
According to Esdras VP, It re-
sembles Zen only in the same
way Discordian golf resembles
golf, but in order to explain that,
he would have to explain the
rules of Discordian golf, and that
is a cult secret However, it has a
lot to do with Discordianism.

Historically, Discordianism
is a religion, or a joke, or a joke
of a religion, or a religion of a
Joke, or perhaps none of the
above, or all of the above, which
came into being when Mala»
clypse the Younger and Lord
Omar had that vision in the
bowling alley in the 1950's.
Discordia, or Eris. is solely re-
sponsible for the peace sign,
which is a symbol for the num-
ber 5, the holy number for all
Discordians.

Who is Esdras VP? He is

not said. however. it is certainly
a possibility since he would have
the power. and regardless, he is a
Pope. As Esdras VP is a Pope.
You and 1 are Popes as well, as is
everyone at Grinnell, since every
man, woman, and child is a
Pope.

What does the "We're Beat-
rice" cabal offer its members here
at Grinnell? As has already been
stated, Discordian Golf. but the
rules, unfortunately. are a secret.
They also participate in Discor-
dian Zen. What is Discordian
Zen? As you may have noticed,
that question really wasn't an-
swered earlier. What occurs is
that anyone interested in partici-
pating writes 5 separate actions
down on 5 index cards, They
then send these actions to Esdras
VP in his post office box. Esdras
then shufﬂes all the cards, and

sends S of them back to each
participant. When you receive
the 5 actions, you aren't required
to do anything. if you want to.
you can read the actions. And if
you feel like doing any of thcm,
it is not encouraged, and not dis-
couraged. It is impulsive not
compulsory, lt's impulsory not
compulsive. One of the two.

This activity is not unique
to the Discordians. It is a cus-
tom of some Christians to write
down grievances and place them
in a box. People then pick out
grievances from the box, and pray
for the people grieving, This
custom's impulsiveness is simi-
lar to the impulsiveness experi-
enced with Discordian Zen. It is
"a wall of chaos to bounce off of,
but it doesn't look like a wall,
because we Discordians stand
apart." This is supposedly a
catrna of the Discordians, who,
according to Esdras, don't have
dogmas.

Esdras VP gave examples
of some actual cards. "Make up
phony psychological studies and
circulate them. For example, a
recent issue of Psychology Today
stated there was a correlation be-
tween amount of stress in college
students and the color of their
urine." "Leave a paper airplane in
a silverware receptacle in your
dining hall." "Walk around for a
day with your hair taped to your
forehead," "Climb a tree." And
the list goes on, These cards,
sent in by the participants, are

Besides Discordian Zen, and
Discordian Golf, the Discordians
recently held a Moosemas cele-
bration. Moosemas is a Discor-
dian holiday celebrating the
nativity of the Great Astral Un-
gulator Bullwinkle the Moose,
Eris's consort. The Moose oracle

would like to become a member

they would need Io do is to send a
request to Esdras VP for a mem-
bership form at his home, Post
office box 11-88. Those inter-
ested in participating in Discor-
dian Zen should send cards to the
same box, However, if you hapv
pen to know who owns that PO
box, don't bother him. As men-
tioned before, he has nothing to
do with this. He is just an inno-
cent bystander whose box Esdms
