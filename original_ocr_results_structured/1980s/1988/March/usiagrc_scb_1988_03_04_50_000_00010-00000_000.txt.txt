and was in the mood ior a good
argument. So I brought up politics.
and we had a pretty good right go-
ing ior about an hour, Somehow we
went from Reagan to Rehnquist to
the Supreme Court to abortion, and
I was faced with my friend Rob,
who considers himself Catholic,
saying that men have no right to
make any kind oi judgment about
the morality oi abortion because
their bodies are not involved

It would seem that at this point I
would have ielt smug, seeing as
one oi my iriends was supporting a
strong position that I believed in,
but this simply was not the case.
Rob can be really arrogant at
times, and loves to rub your nose in
it whenever he can, so I felt Ihad to
undercut his argument at any cost,
even if it meant undermining my
conﬁdence in my own beliefs. Sol
started asking questions.

“Rob, on a diiierent topic, do you
think it's right to take action to pro
tect people, like the illegal aliens.
who cannot protect themselves?”

“Sure," he said, “It’s the decent
thing to do.”

“Then don’t you have a duty to
protect the rights oi people. in the
iorm oi fetuses, who can'tspeak up
for themselves?”

He was quiet for a little while
and then retorted that a piece oi
organic matter smaller than a
dime was not a person. Needless to
say, the debam raged on for along
while aiter that; only coming to an
end alter someone oitered to buy a
couple oi pizzas ii we'd shut up.
While we did take the pizza bribe
and shut up. the argument con-
tinued to bother me long atter i
came back to Grinnell. .

~l could no longer see as ianatics
people who really believe that the
merger of a sperm and egg con-
stitutes a person and who think
that abortion is wrong; they gen
nuinely believe that they are deierr
ding the rights or people in society
that are totally unable to defend
themselves. [continue to have pro
blems with trying to deal with this.
I really have no idea what the
morally right position is.

But that doesn’t stop me irom
thinking about what actions per
taining to abortion seem wrong
Does blowing up living people in
the name of unborn ones
demonstrate one's respect ior
human life? Is it moral, in follow
ing the dictates of the Catholic
church since Vatican II, to forbid a
woman an abortion though it
means that she will die of come
plications? I just cannot think of
ways to support either of these ac-

‘ tinns which result in the death of
innocent people. i suppose in the
latter case that, ii you consider a
fetus a person. one is respecting
the unborn person's rights by max-
imizing its chance to live a full life.
But at the expense of another fully
living and viable person?

One thing, however. does seem
clear: the Supreme Court, which
represents a very narrow group of
interests, and very inadequately
the interests oi women, would
seem a poor body to decide
whether or not abortion should be
legal. This question is particularly
sticky because those citizens with
a good deal of money may get
around anti-abortion laws by ﬂying
to a country in which abortion is
legal. How just would it be ior the
court to enact a set of laws only
governing the actions at certain
economic classes? How just would
it be for them to enact laws that
they would not need to comply
with? Enter Rehnquist. enter
Scalia, exit justice.

why certain issues on campus
seem more popular then others.
Many groups on campus, par-
ticularly those concerned with
ioreign issues, are hampered by
our locale. Because of this factor,
these groups are limited to three
basic courses of indirect action:
moneyrraisers ior these causes,
education of Grinnell students, and
writing policy makers to improve
the situation. i applaud their eta
forts because these issues are imr
portant, and yet I am also aware
that problems exist “in our own
backyard,” like the homeless
issue, which are more accessible to
concrete and direct action on the
part of the student body (some ex»
amples include the Native
American interest Group’s tutors
ing sessions ior Native American
children within Iowa and the trips
of Students Helping the Homeless
to shelters in Des Moines with food
and people to make repairst, And
these problems are being
neglected in terms of overall in-
terest in iavor oi the issues dealing
with ioreign countries or peace.
Why is this so? Some cynics have
suggested that Grinnell students.
like college students everywhere,
prefer (I almost cringe to use this
term) the “glamorous issues," I
hope and pray that this is not the
case.

The bottom line is that I don't
want Grinnell to fall into the trap of
the ’605 generation (which perhaps
is an extreme example, but
similarities do exist) 7 which is
that when these people were
young, they loudly proclaimed to
hold all sorts of idealistic values.
yet 20 years later, many ‘had
become the sell—centered Yuppies.
How deep were their values? Don't
their final actions speak louder
than their words? I believe that the
’60s generation (and of course
there were exceptions) went wrong
in their benign hypocrisy. their
naivety 7 their concentration on
their rights rather than their
responsibilities. For while It is
easy to point out a problem (and it
is your right to do so), it is far more
difficult to make yourself an effec-
tive part of the solution.

Scarlet and Black

As for Peace Day, I think the
idea could be transferred effective-
ly to a symposium, or Grinnell Col-
lege could make a point oi having a
keynote speaker on peace each
year 7 but then people would not
be expected to come in such large
numbers. I also think that chang~
ing Relays by making Saturday a
relaxed “day of bands" is great.
What i must question. however, is
the wisdom oi combining a party
(and I know enough people who say
they will be drinking that day to
know it will be a party) with a
serious issue, The two can cancel
each other out ~ and all that is left
is a good time traipsing around in
the guise of a good cause. Peace
Day is not an acceptable com-
promise.

Furthermore, a friend of mine
described the Peace Day as “a
slap in the iace oi peace.” 1 have to
agree, especially when the ten-
tative Saturday schedule starts out
with the Bloody Mary and Bagel
Breakfast, then immediately
moves to a renowned speaker such
as Bishop Desmond Tutu or Jimmy
Carter. What message does this
schedule give about our
seriousness about peace? A guy
who lives in my dorm told me,
"Hey, I'd be drunk anyway. Why
not listen to Bishop Tutu?" I told
him that he might be missing the
point. it would be embarrassing to
have a renowned speaker and the
representatives oi various groups
speaking to a drunk audience.

I expect to get some heat for this
letter. i usually keep pretty quiet,
yet i ieel moved to speak oi my
concerns, i had hoped that people
had learned that peace has to be
tocused and concrete after many oi
the peace rallies in the Y605 and Y705
proved largely to be insincere. i
feel some sadness because I love
the people at this school and I know
that we can all do better.

Therefore, lsay to you: Grinnell
can be an ivory tower in comr
parison to the rest oi the world, but
let us rise above thatrwhen we do
have our commitments, let us be
serious about them. —Eli1abeth
Dahl, class of ".10

ATTENTION: increased open
hours to deal with the prespring
break crunch will begin about
Wednesday, March 9. The YMCA
will be open an extra hour (until 5
am), and Darby and Carnegie
will be open (but not staffed) all
night. up to niday, March 19.
Moreover, the YMCA will be open
and staffed earlier on the weekend
betore mid-semester exams
(March 1213), beginning at 9 a.m.
it you have any iurther sugges-
tions for alleviating the crunch,
TELL SACC.

With a Sﬁrpercent response rate,
the survey from late last semester
about word processing at Grinnell
was iairly successful. The results

have been analyzed; if you would

disagree with is the idea that the
time commitment which accom»
panies athletics “makes the sth
dent body the losers." Indeed. par-
ticipation in athletics is a time
commitment, as is participation in
GORP, drama, iolk dancing, or
chair. holding a position in the
5&8, yearbook, KDIC staii, or pur-
suit oi any other extracurricular
activity at Grinnell, Do the authors
feel that all of these activities are
also detrimental to the student
body and to the character of Grins
nell? li not. why is athletic par-
ticipation a detriment? Coaches
are careiul to respect academic
commitments, and like any activi~
ty. the amount of time one com~
mits to athletics is directly related
to one's interest in the activity and
time constraints.

11‘ Miss Stout and Messrs. Cox,
Hardwick, and Swanson choose not
to participate in or encourage
Grinnell athletics, that is certainly
their right and is not wrong in any
way. However, though they might
personally choose indiiierence.
they have no right to request that
others do so. For many, athletics is
an extremely valuable part oi the
Grinnell Experience. — Paul w.

like a complete report and precise
breakdown oi statistics, please
TELL SACC. Next week some in-
teresting stats will be reported.

Class use oi the Darby 202
class/terminal room has been
rescheduled to the mornings; it is
thereiore open (but not staiied)
irom noon on every weekday ior
student use. (According to the uc
use survey, this is the least-used
group oi terminals on campus _
you are most likely to iind an empr
ty terminal there.)

The MathLAN in the new science
building is iully operational, With a
working link allowing the incredir
ble Sun workstations to be used as
terminals to the VAX (to do 50,
type VAX at a Sun prompt). Staff-
ing is irregular, but increasing;
see the schedule on the door to the
terminal room,

Because of the undefined nature
oi the tutors oi word processing at
Grinnell and the ﬂexibility the 60
new workstations planned in the to-
berrenovated ARI-I will give the
college, student workshops for the
word-processmg program MASSll
are on hold. Note, though, that
MASSll is still supported, and on
the LAN in the YMCA, its use is
strongly encouraged; only users oi
diskettes and graphics applica-
tions can reserve time in advance
on the Rainbows.

Now this: since oftrcampus peo-
ple tend to complain the most
about computer access, plans are
being made [or the installation of
one terminal (an Old bkw VTIOOJ
