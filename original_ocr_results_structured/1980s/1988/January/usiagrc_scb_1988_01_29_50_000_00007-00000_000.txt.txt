Raity was not Miss Personality oi

The vitality oi the creatures in-
habiting the house was echoed by
the lovely decoration which
enveloped the salons with a kind of
Old World charm, While one of the
boudoirs possesses a rustic pine are

TV screen which could not emit a
discernible picture. I felt in»
credibly lucky, drinking in my
good iortune with a kind oi quiet
ecstasy.

While my luxurious lodgings
were exquisitely reiined, the
lifestyle oi my downstairs
neighbors was one oi which I could
only dream. Not only do they
subscribe to Vanity Fair, they are
also so unused to work that they
never keep dishrsoap on hand tno

of the charmed inhabitants from
below, a Valkyrie it ever there was
one, came to me requesting soap.
I. but a feeble mall, felt obligated
to thrust at her the soap which I did
not own, but merely rented. The
neighbors' sybaritic life came as
quite a shock to a laborer such as
myself, with my rough-hewn,
culloused hands.

But all good times must end. My
liie oi ruinous dissipation was soon

Crying is best saved ior those

those times. i hadn’t realized that l
was almost crying until i sat down.

perhaps the most frustrating of the

had recognized the sound of her
tears. I think that if I were to see
anyone in Kesho's class, and see
that they were crying. 1 would
automatically assume that this
person was remembering.
Rememberin the evils that were
exposed, an the truths that were
told.

He finished speaking. Kesho took
over, tears beginning to run down
her face. She said, ”Well. class?
What do you think?" Just like she
did after every other presentation
She was still Kesho. Loving us and
encouraging us. No one spoke. She
asked questions. She asked two
people before she asked me. I can't
remember what they said, My
mind was being flooded, my
thoughts being clouded, Then she
asked me,

“Jeff. what do you think?”

l looked at her, I had already
made up my mind up what i was
going to say.

“It sucks." I said in a quxet
whisper. That broke the tension,
The class laughed a little Not
iacetlously. but undersiandingly.
They understood what i meant. I

We all knew it. But We were almost
helpless. It sucked It sucked in a
big way

Kesho smiled at us. all of us She
had sat down. but he was still cry-
ing while he still stood in the front
oi the room, now alone lacing his
reality, l was still crying. too. it
was a sad moment, but it was a
proud moment Kesho was beani-
ing at us like a proud mother,

"I'm such a brilliant professor,"
she said, still smiling that Kesho
Smile.

She was. She really was, In this
class we had touched upon that
part oi education that you almost
never see in the Classroom. It's the
part you always remember it was
your personal education. Do you
understand what I'm sayingl That
part of my education which was
important enough for me to skip a
class in order to write this. That
part of me which said. "if you
don't stop doing what your doing
right now. and put this on paper.
then i am going to just die." it was
that part of my educatiuon which
tells me that it doesn't matter if I
fail my history course. as long as i

sonal education. it was this part
Do you understand”

1 guess the best way to explain it
is by telling you what one person in
the class asked me as we were
leaving class today. it wasn't the
first time she asked me She's ask-
ed me every day, every time i've
seen her, for the last two weeks.
She probably hasn‘t noticed it. but
I have. She asks it with a very
solemn. sad expression on her
face The question is as follou
