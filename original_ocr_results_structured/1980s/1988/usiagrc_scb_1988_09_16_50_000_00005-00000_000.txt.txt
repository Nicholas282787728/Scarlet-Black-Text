Reader finds flaws

Scarlet and Black

 

ith Roth's column

To the Editor:

The World and National Affairs
column of last week
(September 9) contains at least
two flaws that I feel deserve
comment, The first is the
criticism of the Dukakis-
Bentsen ticket on the grounds
that it is a "pair of candidates
whose diverging views fairly fly
in the face of the 'party unity'
theme". This criticism betrays a
misunderstanding of what is
meant by pany unity in this case.
It does not mean that all
members of the party agree on
everything. This is seldom the
case in any party anywhere and
certainly has NEVER been the
case in the Democratic Party.
The Will Rogers quote " I belong
tono organized party. . . I
am a Democrat" comes to mind.

What IS meant by "party
unity" is that the different
sections of the party have
UNITED behind the ticket and
will work together for it's success
in the fall. This is at least
theoretically true because no
major constituency left Atlanta
feeling ignored as virtually the
entire old line establishment did
in 1972 and as the Southern

moderates did in 84, The only
possibly alienated group is the
Jackson people, and Jackson has
not boltedl

My other complaint concerns
the statement that Ms Roth
finds it "rather odd" that Bush»
Quayle "can expect to find
widespread support among
women voters" while they
oppose ERA and abortion and
offer what is in her estimation an
inadequate child carcpolicy. This
sort of comment is always
issuing from NOW headquarters
and other feminist redoubts but is
unfortunately more wishful
drinking than serious political
analysis.

This kind of rhetoric gains
credibility with those readers
who have very short or
perhaps selective memories. The
fact that a candidate who not
only opposed ERA and
abortion but had NO child care
policy at all won a clear majority
of the women's vote in 1984
running against a ticket that
included the first major party
woman candidate in history.
should be enough to give
feminist commentators pause.

Environmental i sues

 

But Ms. Roth should take
heart, she is in good (cenainly
by her standards) company. A
while back the irrepressible Bella
Abzug, feminist, excongress»
person, and sometime cameo
player in Woody Allen movies
(Manhattan) wrote a book called
Gender Gap explaining why
women were going to unrcloct
Ronald Reagan in 1984. More
recently Molly Yard, President of
NOW said that if Dukakis didn't
pick Jesse Jackson as a mnning
mate he would have to pick " a
non-white woman" as his vice
presidential candidate or face the
fearsome wrath of NOW.

Well as it turned out before
George Bush started making
his post-New Orleans comeback
all the talk was of the gender gap
being in Dukakis's favor. This
despite his aforementioned
choice of Lloyd Beanen who
was at last chock male and very,
very white besides. Perhaps the
lesson to be learned from this is
that it is important to draw
the distinction between reporting
how things perhaps should be and
how they really are. David

To the Editor:

When I was little, my parents
stressed certain rules about social
etiquette. One of the rules they
stressed most was to respect other
people's property and to never
borrow something without
asking. This rule applied
whether I was home or a
thousand miles from home. At
Grinnell we tend to assume that
the small environment permits us
to temporarily forget this
courtesy.

Saturday night, while outside
Darby, I watched as someone
tried to ride away on my bike.
When I confronted this person,
they self»righteously argued that
they were just borrowing it and
were planning to return it. I
could never imagine borrowing
someone's bike without
permission in New York: what
makes Grinnell any different? A
person's property should be
respected, probably more so in a
small community such as
Grinnell,

Sunday night in between
11:00 and 12:00 my bike was
stolen from the Forum Beach.

Not only is Costa Rica a
tropical fmit haven, it is also a
haven, like many third»world
countries, for pesticides. Less
strict regulations on pesticides
leads to the use of chemicals that
are known to be harmful to
people who apply or consume
them. Costa Rica. an especially
serious example, boasts the third-

highest rate of stomach cancer in
the World, behind Japan and
Chile. One of the major causes of
stomach cancer is pesticide
consumption.

Even within our protective
national borders, we cannot
escape from pesticide residues on
our food, For instance, over half
of the cherries, grapefruit, lcttuce,
peaches, strawben'ies, and celery
grown in the United States have
pesticide residues on them when
they are sold. and imported pro»
duce is generally even more con-
taminated. Furthermore,
imported produce often contains
the pesticides that have been
banned in the United States, so
we consume the chemicals
anyway.

Environmental pollution due
to pesticide use also directly
harms humans. In Nicaragua, for

instance, DDT use is not
regulated. The level of DDT in
mother's milk there has been
determined to be 45 times greater
than tolerance levels set by the
World Health Organimtion.

In the Midwestern United
States, too, chemical pesticides
and fertilizers enter ground water.
The Greenpeace ship "Beluga" is
currently sailing down the
Mississippi River, testing the
water for pollutants and
interfering with plants that are
dumping into the waterway.
According to one spokesperson,
the mouth of the Mississippi in
the Gulf of Mexico boasts a
sterile, polluted area half the size
of Lake Ontario.

Why are pesticides used? The
central reason is increased yields
on farms that lead to higher
profits and more available food.

Although pesticides are an
integral part of agricultural
production today, thcro are
alternatives to their use, as well
as instances where they are
unneeded.

Consumers pressure corpora-
tions, and thus farmers, to use
pesticides. If a fruit or vegetable
has a ﬂaw or a blemish, it is
often considered unfit to eat, even
if the injury to the food is
minimal or only external. The
easiest way for farmers to meet
the demand of produce perfection
is to eliminate every possible
pest through intensive pesticide
application. To meet the
standards of this consumer

Burling in a hurry. Because of
the insensitivity of this person, I
had to ask a friend to wait until I
ﬁnished working on a computer
and to give me a ride home. That
may not seem like much, but I
live near Pcnrose where a woman
was recently raped, I‘d like to
know if the person responsible
for “borrowing" my bike will
pick me up after work (a twenty
minute walk at three o'clock in
the morning).

Tuesday night my bike reap-
peared by the Forum Beach. Rue
mor has it that it was in front of
1006 Park St Nobody there
knows where it came from, and I
can‘t blame anyone there without
any evidence. I think that who
ever look it realized that the back
wheel is.loose and that the brakes
hardly work. If this person
should decide that s/he is entitled
to "borrow" another bike, I hope
the back wheel does fall off but
only after the brakes fail.

Our actions affect others more
than we probably care to think.

concern, today twenty percent of
pesticides used are solely for
improving produce appearance.

Consumers also rarely seek
out alternative food sources to
avoid pesticides. Organically-
grown crops, although at times
more expensive than foods grown
with chemical pesticides, are not
involved in the risks and harms
of pesticide use, and are thus
generally safer to eat.
Furthermore, buying organic
foods supports the organic food
producers, making a statement
about the necessity of reducing
pesticide use on produce both in
the United States and on a global
level.
