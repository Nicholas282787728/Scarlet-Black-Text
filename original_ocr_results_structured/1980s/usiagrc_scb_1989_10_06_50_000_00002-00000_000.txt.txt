HEARINGS ON ‘STUDENTS
AGAINST I'IIPPIES’ PLANNED

Judicial Council hearings on the group Students
Against Hippies and its controversial posters should
get under way soon, sources say.

The hearings have been delayed because the five
studentmembers ofJudicialCouncilhadnotyetcom~
pletcd their training. Personnel changes in Student
Affairs prevented the students
from being trained in August as
planned.

JenniferKrohn,adviserto.lu-
dicial Council, said she herself
is learning about the judicial
process.

“I‘m in the process of figure
ing out how Judicial Council works,” Krohn said.

Mike Kent, founder of Students Against Hippies,
said he expects the hearings to take place possibly
next week. Kent said he filed papers with Judicial
Council againstPete Kazenof f and Eric Norton, who
Kent says tore down the group’s signs in a violation
of his freedom of speech. Posters forStudents Against
Hippies showed cartoons of protesters being blown
up and read, ”Blood, Hippies, Blood" and “Bohemi-
ans must be destroyed.”

According to Kent, Kazcnoff and Norton, along
with Matthew Morrison and Daniel Wcrner, filcd a
case against thcgroup because diey found the posters
offensive.

In a prepared statement issued last week, Kent said
he would continue to put up the posters and vowed to
sue the college if Judicial Council rules against his
group and tries to prohibit the signs.

Krohn declined comment on the Judicial Council
cases. —RRENDANSHEP1IERD

A CLIMAX TO
CONDOM CONTROVERSY

In hopes of resolving a controversy over the poor
quality of condoms sold in machines on campus, the
college has decided to stock on improved type of
condom in the machines, says Rob Killion, president
of the Student Government Association.

Killion said the decision was reached by SGA and
the Office of Student Affairs.

According to Killion, the new condom is of a better
quality than the previous brand, which received poor
ratings in the March issue of Consumer Reports. The
new Lifestyle condom will not contain a lubricantor
the spermicide nonoxynol-g, although the college
Health Center will continue to supply lubricated
condoms with nonoxynolr9 for free, at two per visit.

Killion said hedoes not expect any majorproblems
with the solution, although he appeared to be wearing
thin on the whole issue.

“It’s not by far a perfect solution, but it's the best
solution,” he said. “It’s unbelievablehow many timcs
I’ve said ‘condom' in the last month or so.”

LESBIAN AND GAY
TASK FORCE STARTING UP

A task force on gay and lesbian concems at Grinnell
should come together this week, college presidentGeorge
Drake said Tuesday.

Drake said the committcewould bemade up of about 15
people — five or six students and about 10 faculty
members. Drake said heand college vice-presidentWaldo
Walker had drawn up a list of
prospective faculty members to
join the task force, but would
notrelease theirnames because
he had not contacted them yet
to offer them the spots.

Dean of student affairs Tho-
mas Crady would not release
the names of students who will be asked to join the task
force.

But sophomore Melanie Cooley said she had been
offered a seat on the committee and had accepted. It was
Cooley’s request to live-offcampus with her lover—and
the college’s denial of that requesti that sparked a series
of protests last spring.

Drake said he would not offer seats on the task force to
any faculty members until the final details of the task
force, including its exact name and specific functions,
have been spelled Out. He said the focus of the task force
— whether it Will “focus exclusively on gay and lesbian
issues or comprehensive and general issues" # has been
under discussion.

Drake said that the group’s first meeting might come
after October break.

SGA PROPOSES REMODELING,
INCREASED FUNDING FOR 630
TheStudentGovemmentAssociationhasrecommended
to college president George Drake that the college renor
vate and remodel the Gay Resource and Human Resource
Centers, and expand the centers’ library with $2000
immediately and $1000 every year thereafter.
The recommendations stem from an evaluation of the
centers done last May by SGA’s Committee on Student
Life.

The evaluation report. released lastweek, noted that the
“library appeared small" and that the centers “currently
have no budget for resources and could sorely use them."

The report said the centers should be remodeled “to
make efficient use of space" and “to house larger and
smaller meeting areas.“

The report also recommended that the college install a
computer terminal that would link the centers' library to
Burling Library’s forthcoming computer card catalogs.
Senators are mlking about striking the recommendation
on the computer until a cost estimate is made.

Drake,askcdabouttlicrecommcndations Tucsday,stiid
he had not. yet soon the report and declined comment on
the conimiltec's recommendations.

“l’ll certainly look seriously at it," he said.
