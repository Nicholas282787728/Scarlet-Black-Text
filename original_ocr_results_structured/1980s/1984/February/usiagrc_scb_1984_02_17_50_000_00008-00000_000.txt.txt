Black Cultural Weekend to focus on politics
Representative Alan Wheat

by Rory Slater

Representative Alan D. Wheat
(DrMo.) and graduate of 1972, is
not unlike last week's Black
History Month speaker 7 “right
in the middle," He is not riding on
the crest of the “Demopublican”
wave as is the competent Joyce
Tucker of the Illinois Department
of Human Services. However.
Wheat has thus far achieved a
great degree of esteem ior his ef-
fective pacification of a district
approximately 80 percent white
lwhich, by the way, includes Kan-
sas City). Wheat defies convene
tional wisdom which would laugh
away die notion of a black having
been elected under such condi-
tions; biracial coalition building
became Wheat's anchor, and me
black electorate in Kansas City
followed an approaching nation»
wide trend. the mobilization of
potential force great enough to
carry a marginal vote,

that his job involved more work
for his boss, an elected official,
and that his residency re
quirements were not fuliilled
before he began work.

At this point, Wheat was run-
ning ior state legislator. His name
was stricken oh the ballot due to
the conflict with residency re
quiremene. However, the order
was soon overturned by an ap-
peals court, and a relieved Wheat
was elected to the state
legislature.

Wheat ran for a second term,
and the Kansas City Star said in
an editorial that his opponent had
once “served four lackluster
terms in Jefferson City” and was
“well-known not for any outstan»
ding public achievements , Alan
wheat is cut from a different
cloth. He is young, concerned and
articulate. And he is iull or good
ideas The men he respects in
public liie are not the hardboiled,

was given financial support by the
National Organization of Women
(NOW), which agreed with his
pro-choice stand on abortion.
Wheat won the endorsements of
the local ACLrCIO and the United
Auto Workers. He won by a
margin of 57.9 to 40,2 percent.

Wheat is a pioneer, one among
the handful of black politicians
who has been able to make claim
to being “right in the middle." His
career at Grinnell was pivotal.
Having been raised as a child oi a
high ranking (now retired) air
force officer, Wheat says it was
not until he came to rural lowa
that he sensed what it was to be
black. “I basically came out of a
very white background in termsof
people I had associated With all
my life,” he recalls. There were 70
black students at Grinnell, more
than at present, But Wheat was at
Grinnell during a time of student
militancy, and emerged as one oi

 

Alan Whenl after his election 10 Congress in 1982.

In January of 1983, Wheat, a
native of San Antonio, Texas,
headed east to Washington as the
new U.S. representative from
Missouri’s fifth district, the first
black ever to represent
metropolitan Kansas City in Con-
gress. “I wish being black didn’t
make any difference in this job;
but in fact I’m being given an op-
portunity that very few people 7
black or white 7 are ever given:
to serve in Congress. Being black
makes it a little more difficult.”

Wheat is one of several Grins
nellians to serve in Congress. .l.B.
Grinnell himself served during
the Civil War, William s, Kenyon,
'90, served during the First World
War, and Illinois Republican Tom
Railsback, ’54, served eight terms
until his 1982 primary defeat.

Wheat's ascendancy in the
political arena has been marked
with deieating upsets and render-
ing surprises. After Glrnnell anda
hitchhike West, Wheat landed a
job with the Bureau of Outdoor
Recreation in Denver, Colo. He re
mained there until December,
when he was granted an internsh-
ip in Washington, but he reiused
it. Next stop . Omaha - and while
there, he received a call asking
him to come to Kansas City in-
stead This move laid the founda
tion for his political career. After
holding a federal job, he assumed
a county job under a federal man-
power grant,

Yet, the county job and a ques
tion of his residency almost
strangled Wheat’s political career
before it really breathed. He
resigned his county job following
a federal inquiry which suggested

ruthless politicians, but those who
get things done for the people ,. in
this race, Alan wheat is the
handsdown choice."

A seat in Congress for wheat
was almost ordained following a
close primary. Bep. Richard Boll-
ing triggered a mad scramble
following the announcement of his
retirement from his district do-
main oi 34 years. Wheat was one
oi eight democrats vying for the
coveted seat and considered a
irontrunner. “I thought all day 1
was going to win. The numbers
were right," he said, However,
with the majority of the vote
counted, Wheat faced a seemingly
insurmountable margin, finding
himseli 7,000 votes down, He cons
ceded to John Games, the ap
parent winner, in time for the late
news. Carries had already claim-
ed victory. He was “disappointed
and depressed“ and began to cry.
Moments later, the reversal oer
curred, the pathos dissolved:
votes from Wheat’s strongholds,
assumed to have been counted
already, had just been mllied, He
had won by 1,007 votes, Says
Wheat “It was closer than it
should have been. It was
unbelievable, such a mix of emu
tions. It was like a fairy tale.”

The general election campaign
was a less tumultuous four-way
race, wheat focused his platform
on unemployment, calling for
public works programs, and
criticized increased defense spen-
ding, in particular the MX
missile. Beside support from
labor, business and blacks. Wheat

the leaders of the now defunct
Concerned Black Students (CBS)
— the predecessor of the now
Black Student Council (BSC). CBS
took over Burling Library in
November 1971 until the ad.
ministration responded to a list of
demands called the Black
Manifesto, Wheat was one of six
negotiators and became widely
recognized as a black spokesman.
Ironically enough, prior to 1971,
Wheat had held the Organization
inel‘lective.

Racial separation was then the
cry of Grinell's black community:
a separate admissions board,
special living arrangements,
special courses, and so on.
Wheat's views have now changed;
now he feels black studies should
became an integral part oi the
basic curriculum. His is a tone not
far from that of Grinnell’s current
black student body.

An economics major, wheat
remembers several professois,
James Hamilton. his adviser,
John Dawson, known as “Black
Jack" for his tough assignments
and grading; and Robert Voert-
man, who provided a new way of
looking at society. For Wheat, his
time at Grinnell was “a culture
shock of the greatest magnitude.”
It gave him a sense of idealism;
he calls it ”the essence of Grin-
nell." For Rep, wheat, this
idealism has translated into a
workable, rarely managed ap
proach to politics — of the
biracial, bisocial nature.

F armer Panther leader

Bobby Seale

by Andy Brown

To the average white American,
the Black Panther Party conjures
up the picture oi an anarchistic
band of gunrtoting, whiterhating
thugs. This is hardly surprising.
for the Black Panthers were sub
jected to a campaign of vilitica-
tion (to say nothing oi terror)
since the inception of their
organization. Spiro Agnew
declared Bobby Seale and the
Panthers a “completely lrrespon»
sible, anarchist group of

criminals,"
in January, 1970, four reporters

from the Wall Street Journal
found that a clear majority of
blacks supported both the
methods and goals of the Black
Panthers. The Panthers didn't
just advocate militancy; they
strove for economic and political
power, They appealed to youth
and contributed much to Black
awareness. But most blacks sup-
ported the Panthers because they
admired other, less publicized acr
tivivies such as the Party's free-
breakfast program for ghetto
youngsters, its free medical care
program, and its war on narcotics
use among black youth. Never
before in the history of Black
Americans had an admittedly
revolutionary party won such sup»
port in the leading black com-
munities of this country.

The Black Panther Party for
Self-Defense was organized in
Oakland. Calif, in the Fall of 1966
by two black militants: Huey
Newton and Bobby Seale They
began working with the black
community in Oakland’s ghetto,
knocking on doors and asking
residents what they needed and
wanted. with the answers they
formed the Panthers’ “ten-point”
program,

This platform included the
following demands: full employ
ment; decent housing; education
“that teaches us our true history
and our role in die presentrday
society”; exemptions of Blacks
from military service; an i -
mediate end to police brutality:
lreedom for all Blacks held in
Federal, State and County
prisons; and Black power “to
determine the destiny of Our
Black Community.”

Newton and Scale were deeply
influenced by Malcom X and
Frantz Fanon, Malcom X stressed
the joys of Black brotherhood, its
historic origins, the beauty‘of

Former Black Panther Bobby
Seale.

black culture as well as the be-
nefits to be gained through com-
promise with whites. It was the
martyred Malcom X's emphasis
on self-defense and his effort to
lead the struggle “by any means
necessary” that most deeply im-
pressed Newton and Scale
Newton and Seale were also im-
pressed by Fanon‘s thesis that
revolutionary violence was essenr
tial in order to achieve the rebirth
of the black personality By
fighting back, the black man
would assert his dignity as man

Seale also showed keen insight
into the nature of American in
tervention abroad. He understood
that the Vietnameses people were
fighting for their right to seli—
determination, just as blacks are
struggling to do at home, He was a
bitter opponent of American in»
volvement in Viemam, particular-
ly resentful that blacks ”living in
wretched ghettos and oppression"
were forced to put their lives on
the line for the ruling white
establishment

Since his resignation from the
Black Panther Party in July of
1974, Bobby Seale has continued to
be a spokesman ior America’s
poor and oppressed. Few people
have been so deeply involved in
the struggle for Black liberation,
or against institutionalized
racism, exploitation and i
justices in America. Mr. Seale is
in a unique position to lead,
organize, and to speak out on cur
rent issues and the situation of the
oppressed human condition,
