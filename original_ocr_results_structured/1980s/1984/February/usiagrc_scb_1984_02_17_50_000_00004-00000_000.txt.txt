Life in Iowa after the caucuses

For Grinnellians, the hoopla surrounding this Mon-
day’s Iowa Caucuses started last year when Gary
Hart made stops in Herrick Chapel and The Pub in an
effort to whip up support for his presidential nomina-
tion bid. Since then, candidates Alan Cranston,
George McGovern and most recently Reubin Askew
have made appeals for our support.

But on February 21, Iowans will awake to find
themselves very much devoid of attention from the
candidates and the press, What will Iowa do when the
Democrats have moved on to New Hampshire 7
when the national spotlight is moved and the glitter
fades?

Here in Grinnell, as is surely the case throughout
much of this state, people have been so exposed to the
candidates as to almost become blase about their ap-
pearances, Askew drew a respectable audience last
Tuesday in South Lounge, but there was no feeling of
anticipation on campus before his visit, Still, it was in
all likelihood the last time a candidate for president
will speak here until 1987.

Iowa receives all of this courting from the can-
didates and attention from the press every four years
because it is the first state officially to serve notice
as to who may have a chance at the nomination and
who is a mere pretender. The distinction of being
first is fiercely protected by Iowa’s Democratic
leadership since it ensures that the political/media
circus will focus America‘s attention on the state.
This attention is desirable for all of Iowa’s citizens
because it translates into exposure and money; two
things that are essential to economic well-being.

Unfortunately, this period of exposure lasts only
for a few weeks every four years. In a few days, Iowa
will slip from the pages of newspapers and
magazines outside of the state and people will no
longer take such an interest in the goingson of the
Hawkeye State. 0n the other hand, life will go on here
and people will continue their business without
scrutiny from transient politicos and scribes.

State and local leaders are keen on doing
something to develop and keep an outside interest in
Iowa. A proposed Trade Center in Des Moines is one
way that outside attention and money could be
brought to the state on a continuous basis. There are
numerous-cities throughout the state with the room,
resources and desire to grow, and people in these
cities are always looking to expand in the right direc-

Telethon participation and concerns

Despite the rumblings of some students about a
possible boycott of the Spring Telethon in order to
dramatize dissatisfaction over, among other things,
the handling of the Georgia Dentel situation, the
event appears to be proceeding smoothly.

There have been attempts in the past to politicize
the semi-annual fundraising event, but there are
always enough students who see the beneficial
aspects of the event to keep it alive. The same can be
said for the current effort,

The telethon is in a unique position in that it helps
the administration meet its annual operating budget
and a boycott of the event would send a clear, painful

tion,

Even when Iowa is not grabbing the limelight,
though, there is still plenty to be proud of here, even
if few outside the state know about it. Iowa has a deal
to offer in social, cultural, educational, economic and
other arenas. The caucuses are important to and fun
for the people of this state, but even when they move
on there will still be things to keep people here involv-
ed.

So after the caucuses are over, after the last light
on the last minicam has been shut off, after the last
candidate trundles off to New Hampshire and the last
reporter follows him out, will Iowa be let down'.7 Sure,
there will be some disappointment at the loss of at-
tention, but this letdown won’t last.

This state and the people in it have too much going
not to continue as always. Even if people in other
parts of the country don’t know much about Iowa, we
who choose to be at least temporary residents of this

state know how fortunate we are to be here.

message of dissatisfaction to the administration. On
the other hand, part of the money raised is used to
meet the costs of attending Grinnell College and if
students did not raise the money it is conceivable
that tutition would rise as a result. So students with
gripes about administrative policies might be put in
the foolish position of hurting themselves in order to
spite others if they choose to boycott.

It is important to examine first the nature of a
boycott. There must be a sizable participation in it in
order to be effective. Boycotting for one‘s personal
beliefs, even when most others do not agree with
those beliefs, is honorable but it may also do little
more than give the impression of laziness This time,
at least, the issues have not appealed to the students
as being worth trading some financial help for a
political statement,

The telethon, and the students who choose to par-
ticipate in it, are not being judged here as wrong. On
the contrary, the telethon is not hurting anyone’s
cause and is in fact helping the school, which we all
pay a good deal of money to be a part of, to operate.

Nontheless, issues exist which must be addressed
by the students. The letter urging conciliation on the
Dentel controversy sent to the administration by the
SGA is a step in the right direction.

What else can students do to let their voices be
heard'.7 The first thing is try to find out as much as
possible about the issues of concern. That is where
the SRtB becomes involved, and we do our best to cols
lect that information. The rest is up to you.

A dif ere
of 1984

by Wes Joe

in 72 hours, the Iowa Caucuses
will offically inaugurate the
Democratic presidential primary
elections of 1984, Candidates aps
pearances, press coverage and
campaign literature continue to
remind us about the need to
replace Reagan’s destructive ad-
ministration with a Democrat,
Many Grinnellians, however,
quickly tire ol the platitudes and
ambiguous political language
which constitutes the current
dialogue among Reagan's
challengers. Yet the tedious
character of candidate “debate"
must not lull us into dangerous
passivity. Thus my purpose in this
column is to offer a more subtle
argument, which even Walter
Mondale has not addressed, for at-
tending the caucuses and suppor-
ting former Vice-President Mon-
dalet

Grinnellians recently heard a
compelling argument against a
second Reagan term intimated
not by any candidate, but by the
perceptively sensitive George F.
Kennan. In his lecture “American
Dipolmacy 7 Revisited (II),”
Kennan diagnosed the American
body politic’s “military-industrial
addiction”, i.e. the “vested in
terest in the cold war” which
American defense contractors
and national security
bureaucracies sustain. These
organizational entities help to
perpetuate the cold war ethos and
then feed on a frigntened
citizenry. The thermopolitical
temperature of anticommunist
tear is the measure of military-
industrial vitality 7 anxiety in
duces the addiction. Such habits
intenSliy when the addict commits
more and more resources to satis-
iying the need A second term for
Reagan would surely further our
dependence on the military
industry complex.

The physical expansion of the
military sector pretends grave
possibilities. This incestuous rela
tionship between wapons
deSigners and Pentagon policy
designers cedes enormous in»
iluence over national security
policy to military protiteers, Two
current cases exemplify this
analysis.

Sen. David Pryor (D~Ark.)
recently launched an investigas
tion of the Defense Department's
Science Board (DSB) on “raw,
certain and dangerous" conﬂict of
interest charges. One exemplary
cause involves a vice-president of
TRW Inc, a major contractor in
DOD'S research and development
efforts for laser/space
technology, who shared both the
DSE’s task force on High Energy
Lasers and its Review of the DOD
SpaceBased Laser Weapons
Study (“Chemical and Engineer-
ing News,” August 22, 2983).

Several key Reagan Advisors
received gitts of stock valued at
millions of dollars irom an optics
company which stands to received
contracts for laser weapons
research. A Irontrpage story in the
April 28, 1983, “New York Times”
reveals that, “recipients of the
stock include Edward Teller, the
physicist and a member of the
White House Science Council, who
helped persuade Mr. Reagan to
adopt the [Space weapons] plan.
and Robert Gray. a public rela~
(ions executive with close ties to
the Reagan family.”
