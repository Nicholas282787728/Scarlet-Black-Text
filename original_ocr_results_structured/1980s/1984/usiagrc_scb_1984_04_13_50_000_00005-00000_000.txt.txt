Jud Co
is a joke

To the Editor

Aiter observing the Judicial
Council Meeting Of Aprll4.1984.it
looks like the council could be
very busy in the near iuture,

If the Judicial Councd is going
to allow Such trivial matters as
people being woken up to be
brought before the council. the
council would have to meet
twentyrfour hours a day.
Everybody at Grinnell has been
rudely awoken more than once
during their stay here. and most
people do not feel threatened
enough to bring the issue before
Jud Co.

The charge I really got a kick
out of was the fact that the Norris
Resident Advisor Kino Ruth was
trying to associate the above ac-
tions as "willful or negligent ac-
tions th 'r‘h endanger the health
and so‘ .y of other persons on
campus," Mr. Ruth tried to argue
the point that not enough sleep
was hazardous to one's health. In
that case why doesn't Grinnell il'l'
stitute a bed check so we will all
be nice and healthy. We won’t
have our work done, but at least
we will all be in good health.

What the issue comes down to is
that the members of the Norris
Council felt threatened by the Size
of the defendants. and admitted
this at the hearing. They woidd
not confront the defendants due
to the fear of being harmed. The
Norris Hall Council cannot actual»
ly believe that one of the defen-

dants could do bodily harm to a
council member. could they? if
the defendants laid one hand on
any council member. the defenr
dant would be out of Grinnell
iaster than you could say assaultl

punishable? ii I punch a window
five times and it does not break.
do I still have to pay for it? i would
guess not. but alter last Wednese
day night I'm not sure.

Jud Co convicted a defendant of
vandalism ior taking out a hinge
pm For those oi you who are not
mechanically inclined. the hinge
pin takes two seconds to replace
ivitlibut any damage to the door or
pm.

And i thought Joint Board was
the biggest Joke on campus! 1 ll 7

its need to be revised

Invitation

extravagance

To the Editor:

The formal waltz invitations
distributed by SGA (Student
Government Association) are an
unnecessary extravagance. Witii
the budget so tight this year. this
kind of frivolity should be
eliminated. In the future I hope
that SGA will rely on the
economical and effective Memo
and Scarlet and Black for
publicizing the waltz — Paula

Are we asking too much?

by ion Modem

“with God's help we shall litt
Shangha ip and up. ever up. until
it is jus ike Kansas City.” These
words. spoken by Senator Kenr
neth Wherry in the fifties. form
my favorite quote by an American
public offical.

They speak volumes ior
America’s naivete concerning the
world. in which we build a big.
fluffy model oi how everyone
should act. based on idealized.
rigid criteria which we ourselves
do not meet, They are also periect
for describing the attitude of
American liberals to the intitial
round oi E1 Salvador's elections.

These elections have been pum-
meled by the us, media and
liberal ‘community, they were
”unfair". "disorganized". and
contained vote fraud. This seems
to be enough to invalidate the elites
tions, without even considering
that the “important" participa-
tion of the Marxist guerillas was
absent, How. thc liberal come

Divestment
policy
questioned

To the Editor,

Speaking as a dissenting. and
absent. member of the South
African Support Group I question
Owen Charles' assertion that
divestment is the only way Grin-
nell can responsibly act in an efs
iort to change the current situa
tion in South Africa

In his article. Uwcli Charles
maintained that U.S. corporations
have no better record with regard
to changing the conditions that
currently extst in accordance with
the Apartheid laws. Yet in a New
York Times article from Nov. 6.
1983 little doubt was left that the
Sullivan Principles. baby steps
that they are. have had an eitcct
for the better.

Still. suppose divestment were
the answer. The goal or divest
ment. is to force u.s. corporations
to leave South Africa, which
would cause masswe economic
and political turmoil This would
in turn probably lead to a revolur
tion oi some sort resulting in a
majority rule government, Mind
you I do not think any ot myicllovv
SASG want to see bloodshed. but I
am afraid that is exactly what
would happen were the direct goal
of divestment to be reached.

Owen Charles also spoke oi
divestment as a matter of ethics.
The question is which is more
ethical, selling securities to who

munity thunders. can these have
been real elections?

The elections were real and.
moreoever. they were fair. as 75
percent oi the people turned out to
vote despite the efforts ot the ins
surgents to prevent them.

Aside from scrawling happy
thoughts like ”Vote and Die" on
village walls. the guerillas did
much more than confiscate id.
papers. as ABC would have us
believe They blew up planes
which were to carry ballots to the
countryside. dynamited power
lines and bridges to the polling
places, burned ballots and ballot
boxes — all this while carrying on
military operations designed to
ruin the economy ot El Salvador
They are primarily responsible
for the Election's "mass conlu-
sioit" If the liberals want to
blame someone. let them blame
the guerillas

But even if all il’i1S \\ ere not so.
the cultural arrogance oi the
above criticisms IS astounding.

knows whom. most likely go

or no role when protits aie con-

and actively pursuing proxy
resolutions

The truth is I am not a great
believer in proxy resolutions, but I
do see them as the only way of
peacetully bringing an end to
Apartheid. Untortunalely such a
solution is iar from glamorous.
and certainly much border in the
long run. as the glory oi loo-zoo
students all together is rarely
possible. Everyday it is a tight
making sure the trustees know we
mean business. and that is just the
first step. Still. a pcacet’ul solution
to the current situation in South
Airiea is worth the etiort 7 ilngii

To the Editor:

I would like to take exception to
some of the comments made in
Robert Quashie's column in the
April 6. 1934 issue of the scarlet
and Klack entitled. “Basking in
the Limelight.” Particularly, I
would like to focus on the snide
remarks made by Mr. Quashie in
respect to the hedulmg oi the
Sports Symposium events and
President Drake’s motives in
staging the Symposium.

This semester I am fortunate
enough to have President Drake
as an instructor. At Our last class
meeting prior to the Symposium.

This is the same country where
Mayor Richard Daley ruled with a
rod of iron. Where vote fraud is
suspected or having iniluenced
oven presidential elections. and
where large portions of the
population have been prevented
irom voting by arbitrary and
discriminatory laws.

\"et liberals somehow expect El
Salvador. a nation just instituting
representative government.
possessed of a low literacy rate.
torn by civil disorder and harried
by an insurgent army within its
irot'fltzi's to live up to some
nebulous criterion of "fairness",
Are you happy now. Sen. Wherry?

The El ivadbl‘ elections have
shown us thal rill people. not just
the chosen low in America. can
desire a rcprescnlntiite govern-
ment and are c pable of electing

speak. ire repudiate the attempts
at representative government not
only in El alvutloi'. bul in this
country as ivcll,

he brieily discussed various
aspects of the Symposium, in
cluding the scheduling of events.
Although I cannot quote President
Drake directly. he basically said
that every effort had been made to
accommodate the class schedules
of students. like the scheduling of
two events on Thursday after
noon. when many students do not
have class,

As to Mr. Quashle's unfair and
uncalled for remark that the Sym-
posium was staged as a media
event and that it was really "a
feather in George Drake’s can"!
would suggest that Mr, Quashte
ought to be a little more thankiiii
about having such an extraor-
dinary event on campus. and a lit
tlc less critical about the motives
ior having it Indeed the Sym-
posmm received national press
coverage. but it would seem that
this kind of coverage can only
enhance the reputation oi Grinnell
and consequently be beneticial to
Gi’innellians,

AS for President Drake's
motives in staging the event. all
that can be Said is that the Symr
posium was his idea and a matter
of seemingly great importance to
him. Perhaps Drake was fulfilling
a personal dream or ambition,
But Grinnellians Should feel for
tunate that their president has the
desire and motivation to bring
such an outstanding event to cam-
pus.

lithe Sports Symposium was-ins
deed an attempt by President
Drake to add another feather to
his cap, 1 can only hope that he
will add a iew more during my re-
maining years at Grinnell. — Tim
