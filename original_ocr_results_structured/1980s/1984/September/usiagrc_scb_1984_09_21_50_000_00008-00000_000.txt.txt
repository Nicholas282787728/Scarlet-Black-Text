This year. cording to Frazer,

Frazer has been concerned “ltl’l
such issues as buiier days and the

Frazer said that there are special
recruiting iunds available ior
locating minority candidates. but
that the rural setting at the college
poses a problem tn attracting
minority candidates in that it does
not lend itself to the creation oi a
supportive minority cnviroiiiiieni
Frazer pointed out as an example
that "there isn't a black church or
a synagogue to my knowledge in
Grinnell.”

A part oi the college‘s endow

“a great deal oi time and energy"
had been spent listening to the
campus's South African Support

the administration had been
responsive enough "

moves on." commented Betti
Sauerhalt

“There are no limits to his his
terests. He's an American
historian with interests in Russian
diplomacy. Chinese culture. and
urban affairs." stated Associate
Professor at History and Rosen-
field Professor ol Social Studies
Daniel Kaiser. “And he‘s got a
great sense oi humor! "

Most crinnellians agree that
Parker Prolessor of History. Alan
R. Jones. has a deep concern ior
students and has a very \iellr
roundcd background in history.
Jones has been teaching zit Grin»
nell since 1954 but {on students
iand possibly iacultyl know about
all the projects he has been involw
ed in on campus. Jones is also cure
reniiy serving as the College lllar-
shal.

"College Marshal is a ti-adr
tional medieval relic ul academic
processions. it is an lionorllit ate
lair given to elder members oi the
laculty." Jones remarked. As the
College Marshal. Jones organizes
the procession ot {acuity and
Students at comnlelicements and
major convocatlolls.

In 1979. Jones was honored \iilli
the title of Parker Protessor. This
title is one at the honorary titles
given to iaculty. Leonard Parker
was a distinguished pi-oiessor oi
history inmseli during the that
years oi the college. Alter lie died.
his lamily set up an endowment to
honor 0| him

"It's purely honoriiic. " Jones
Smiled. "There are no additional
prerogatives or increase in salary
included in the title."

Among the many- committees on
\ihich Jones serves is the Rosetta
field Program in Public Allan's.
International Relations and
Iluman Rights. This Committee
has a large endowment to bring
programs. speakers, and con-
terences to Grinnell. it also sup-
ports summer internships ior
students and iacul, as well as
student research in public allairs.
international relations. and
human rights.

The Program in Practical
Political Education tPPPEl is
another committee with which
Jones is involved, This program
encourages lnore partisan and
political action on the part oi
students by bringing practical
politics to campus. Some or the
program's older actiVities have
been taken over by the Rosentield
program which also brings
political iigures to campus.

“This iPPPEi program was
more active in the past. It had a
large endowment and grant
money but now is not as heavily
tunded, Also. I think the students

are possibly less active in prac- .

tical politics- these days. The pro-
gram was more active in the woos

\\ hen the mood was more political
than it is now." stated Jones.

Jones has served on the Cure
riculum Committee at various
times He vias lundamental in lm'
plementing the ireshinan tutorial
program when the school dropped
most oi its requirements The
tutorial. the only requirement tor
every department. insures that
Il‘eshmen would recewe a ioundar
tion in uriting and a solid advrsing
system.

The ltcgional and community
Studies interdisciplinary Concen-
tration is another area \\ ith which
Jones is involved ,

"This program was designed to
meet the problems at too many
double majors and also to en-
courage other programs." Jones
replied. "It is more oia secondary
study. or a minor.“

This program originally dealt
with urban and regional students.
Stilcc interest has diminished in
regional studies. the program
may be revised to deal more
speciiically with urban attairs.

Jones has also made a name for

as an expert on a wide range ot
subjects. This is reflected in the
many diiierent types oi courses he
has taught in past years.

"Besides being an American

He's a very versatile scholar. And
