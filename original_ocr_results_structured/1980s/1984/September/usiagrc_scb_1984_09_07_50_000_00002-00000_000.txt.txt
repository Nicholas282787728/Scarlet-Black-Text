Golden discusses
directions for semester

By Ellen E. Brooke

Perennial issues bloom again,
as well as some annuals

An interview with SGA presi~
dent, Matt Golden, by the 5&5
was held to discuss his views of
the iorthcoming year.

Buffer days, SGA's national
political involvement, and
teacher/course evaluations are
returning debates. New items are
the town’s recent enforcement of
the sound ordinance. a review of
possible changes in the college
iaculty and curriculum. whether
Relays will remain a tradition or
become a memory, and some con-
stitutional reforms.

Golden has already discussed
the issue of buffer days with the
department chairpersons.

Mr. Duke, chairperson of the
faculty, would like to create an ad
hoe committee comprising
studenm and iaculty to investigate
possible solutions. A question-
naire to be answered by students,
has been sent to the psychology
department to eliminate any
biases that have been written into
the questions.

Concerning SGA‘s political posir
tion, Golden is hoping for a
smooth, quick Joint Board ap-
proval of a resolution allowing
SGA to join two student lobbies;
one in Des Moines, the other in
Washington, D.C. These student

groups would lobby both state and
the national governments on
many issues, one oi which would
be student iinanciai aid,

SGA’s vice-president. Mary
Kosmidis, will work on creating
new teacher/course endot-the»
semesterrevaluations for the
students to iili out, Asked about
their value, Golden replied,
“They're not conclusive ii there is
a huge diversity. ii any one
response is overwhelming then
they are conclusive."

Golden hopes to alleviate the
problem of stereo noise. Grinnell
has always had a sound ordinance
setting a 10 pm. curfew for loud
noise. This has been the first year
that the police have actually en-
forced it. Golden will be meeting
with the Chief of Police and a
member of the town’s Chamber of
Commerce this Friday to work on
a compromise.

A group or iaculty and students
will examine ways to make
positive changes in the cur
riculum and personnel. According
to Golden. both he and the ad-
ministration would like the cur
riculum to include courses on non
western civilizations and women's
studies

in order to keep within the quota
oi proiessors hired by the college.
Golden believes a solution would
be to hire outside protessors to
teach one course here for one
semester. This has.been done
sporadically in the past. but in
order to maintain a solid program
of studies, it should be done more
consistently. he said.

Considering the size of this
year’s freshman Class, Golden
stated, “If this increase is suss

that the SoViet Union has expanr
sionist tendencies, he said. “The
U.S. must realize that change in
Third World countries is often
isolated irom the East-West
balance of power.”

The administration should not
immediately see each Third
World country as a battleground
ior ideological competition.
Rather. the U.S, government
should first consider a govern-
ment’s legitimacy. Nye believes
that the United States has many

, ,timesci-eatjcda selirl'ulfilling pro
pliccy by‘ enunciating‘ an
ideological conflict in a Third
World nation,

Nye believes that the Reagan
administration is acting properly
in hoping ior a stalemate in the
Iranrlraq war. For he maintains
that it is in the United States' best
interest to see that the status quo
antebellum prevails. The govern»
ment can best pursue this goal by
continuing to tilt its support away
from the winning side.

Nye is hopeiul that President
Reagan can sustain the moderac
tion in his rhetoric Lcss
declarative policy can create the
opportunity ior negotiable u.s

Professor Nyc sees changes in the
United statcs'icrcigii policy at»

quisitc to successful iiegoiiation.

tainable. it would be reasonable to
pick up iaculty members.”

Relays will be an issue between
the administration and Russ
Adams, this year’s Social Coors
dinator. In order ior Relays to
continue as a tradition, Golden
feels that, “We. the students,
must prevent stupid mistakes
from happening. There should be
more control over events,”

Golden sees a need for a con
stitutional reform concerning
what the constitution says and
what actually happens.

Golden and Kosmidis appointed
committee chairpersons. Accorr
ding to the constitution, these 3p~
pointments are to be made by the
Student Rules Committee (SRCl
chair. Under pressure to get com-
mittees formed, Golden and
Kosmidis made the appointments
themselves which, according to
Golden, would have taken the SRC
at least two weeks to make,

The SRC chair would be elected
the first week, and then the coma
mittee chairs would be appointed

Another item confronts the cons
vention that all committees must
include a on representative. Conr
stitutionally, this is only
necessary for the Initiative Fund
Committee (IFC), Golden argues,
“If JB is to be ruled by the con-
stitution, the constitution should
reilect the way things are.',’ .

,Thc interview,,,end,ed,‘with_
Golden urging everyone to go to
JB meetings “There should be
lots of student participation,” To
keep the campus aware oi .18 ac-
tivities, weekly agendas Wlll be
posted in every dorm and the post
office.

State department

denies visa

Chemistry dept. left short

By Ray Pitchford

This semester there is an uner
pected absence in the Grinnell
faculty. A bureaucratic tangle
prevented Dr. Martin Minelli,
Assistant Professor of Chemistry,
irom getting a visa in time to air
rive at Grinnell for the fall
semester. The college hopes Dr.
Minelli, a West German, will ar-
rive by January.

Dr. Minelli was in America dos
ing postdoctoral work at the
University oi Arizona at Tuscon
on a Fulbright Scholarship last
year,

He had to return to Germany
last spring, however, because the
conditions oi the program he was
participating in required him to
return to his home country every
two years.

The college helped him to apply
ior a temporary visa. But a
backlog in the United States im-
migration office necessitated a
five or six month wait because the
quotas ior West Germany were
already tilled.

In addition, the immigration ofv
ficials said that Minelli did not
qualify for a temporary._visa,

which could only‘ be sought ior’

temporary ivork,

Dean oi Faculty Catherine
Frazer commented that although
Grinnell was not an abuser oi the

visa program, some oi the larger
research universities have abused
the program in the past.

The college has applied for a
permanent visa and expects
Minelli here in time tor the spring
semester.

According to Dr. Luther E.
Erickson, science department
chair, Minelli's rnain responsibilir
ty for the fall semester would
have been to teach a class of
(general) Chemistry 129, One
section of this course was cancellr
ed as a result of his absence.

Minelli would have also been in
charge of a few of the lab sections
and would have lectured occa~
sionally to seminar students,
Erickson said, Erickson coma
mented, ”The main impact as far
as students are concerned is
somewhat larger classes in the in-
troduction classes."

Erickson also said that the
chemistry department would han-
dle the laboratory situation by
having one instructor in charge oi
two lab sections at the same time.

Minelli received his PhD. at the
University oi Konstanz in West
Germany.,tle specialized in in

forganic chemistry‘and has done

research work in spectroscopy,
He will teach a course in advanc'
ed inorganic chemistry second
semester
