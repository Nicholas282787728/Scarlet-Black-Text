The New Ulysses

hy Robert Quilshie

Even though 5.000 errors have
been found in the most recent edi-
tions of Ulysses. the entire Joy-
cean enterprise will not have to be

scrapped. Hugh Kenner. pro-
lessor of English literature. said
to an audience gathered in the
South Lounge of the Forum last
week.
The topic at discussion Was the
so—called “New Ulysses.
"Schlolars. librarians. ar-
chivists and a computer have col-
laborated to produce what'may
linally be a true definitive test of
the modern epic which has surviv~
ed the qttachs of pretentious
printers counterfeit and the
ravages of World War II." Kenner
said. during his visit from Johns
Hopkins University where he
teaches courses in modern
literature.
”It' as if you‘ve been making
-due with a secondrate camera.
then somehow you get your hands
on a first-rate lens The deﬁnition
is greatly improved You begin to
size the patterns on black ties and

the hair on the backs of hands."
Kenner said.

This. $125. and a three-volume
set shows the process by which it
was constructed from previous
texts. galley sheets and Joyce's
personal manuscripts. it also con-
tains an explication of each
passage which has been altered.

Note the iamous passage in
which a drunken Stephen
Dedalus. the portrayed young ar-
tist. confronts a visage oi his dead
mother with these words: “Tell
me the word mother. it you know
it now. the word known to all
men." Beaucoup de papers and
theses have speculated but the
corrected text now tells us in a
previous scene that this word is
Love.

Key omissions such as this
resulted in part because of the 26
workers in the Shop which printed
Ulysses in Dijon France. Only the
shop ioreman spoke nominal
English and he oi course. had no
no Ion ol' the Irish.

John Sbarharo. Paul McCready
and Todd Q. Maclnllre.

ian McLean opened discussion
with an explanation oi The Out-
on s purpose He has iound that
political discussions on this came
pus tend to be one sided. He and
other campus conservatives
ihereiore. desire the opportunity
to voice their opinions.

when asked by this reporter
why he has decided not to use the
Sc rlct and IS ck. McLean
replied that he " trying to pro
vide a larger lorum tor the conserr
values than the soul has space to
provide."

lnageneralvein.he“would like
to create an environment with
more student publications and
more forums." McLean said.

Describing The AUulcl’y's con-
tent. McLean explained that it viill
comprise at "thoughtful. well.
rescarched articles giving
students the other side. We have
to be illlormetl today to be the
leaders 0| tomorrow." McLean
claims it \\Ill be an outlet for opi-
nions. not a "political organ“.

The (lulu-y. he says will never
endorse a candidate lie plans to
make sure the articles are wellr
written. ‘ii not ideologically
agreeable to the majority at
students,

McLean stated that this is the
only time The Uulc _> will come to
SUA ior money.

From a needed $599 50 for
publication. son vias petitioned

for $350. which was approved by
the Finance Committee. McLean
explained that the remainder will
be contributed by an individual
entrepreneur in Illinois. cone
tingent that The Outcry is able to
prove that it is a nonprofit
organization.

The Institute for Educational
Atlairs. a conservative organlzzl»
lion located In Washington. D.C..
might also contribute money it
The (lutc is, according to
McLean, "Suitably far right".

The debate ensued.

Darrell Hall called [or a motion
to table this item The agenda did
not adequately iniorm Joint
Board members of this publica-
tion's purpose. making them
unable to discuss the item with
their constituents, and thus cone
stricting the members abiiity to
represent student opinions Hall
said. This motion did not pass. and
discussion continued

Pointing out that The Outcry
does not come under oillclal Stun
dent Publications and Radio
jurisdiction. Dave Mathias quoted
irom Pages 85 and tits at the Stu-
dent Handbook. Wthh states that
SP and R has jurisdiction over all
student publications, He claimed
that The Outcry would also violate
the regulations on student
political activity on pages 86-88.
l-le ielt it unwise to approve this
budget

Prior to JB. McLean had cons
tacted Bill Deminoil concerning
the SP and R issue. Demlnoil in-
formed him that in 1970 a black

Calvin cycle, and Professor of
Chemistry at the University or
California-Berkeley since 1937,
Melvin Calvin is currently
developing such energy in some
pretty untraditional uays.

Since 1964. Calvin has been
working viith three to six people in
the areas of "Artificial Photosyn»
thesis" and “Energy
Agriculture."

Calvin is in the process oi devisv

"What we want to do is ligure out
how the plants capture the sun
and convert it to stored chemical
energy. and then build a device

Though it will be live to ten

vthen asked about the possibillri

ty of using nuclear energy as a
viable substitute to other [arms of
energy. Calvin said that that area
or research gels riiuch more
money because “they think
nuclear energy does it. However.
it only makes electricity."

Furthermore. Calvin lllentloned
that nuclear energy is much less
cost eliicient and requires more

Calvin cited the lack 0| 3 cons-
