So why did these people decide
to itiiiuc to spend IIXNI’ lites at

Jonathan Andelson. associate
prolessor and chair or the Ann
thropology Department. cited his
"very good experience at (Srin-
nell" as at student as one reason
for his return. Andelson said
another reason he returned to
Urinnell was because at Grinnell
he would have greater opportunl-
ty to teach personally interesting
courses than at other institutions.
When Andelson returned to teach
in 1974 tour years after
graduating, he was working on his
thesis on the nearby Amana
colonies. He welcomed the
location of Grinnell for cdnve~
nience.

Alan Jones. Parker Professor ol
History. said he made his return
to Grinnell in 1954 because he was
tired of graduate work and also at

the time jobs were not that plen~ -

Jones never intended to remain at
Grinnell tor more than a year or
so. but this intention evidently
changed. Jones said he had the
chance to teach at large univerr
sities but chose to stay at Grllmell.

Drake. also returned to Grinnell
to teach history. Drake taught on»

reasons he said he was attracted
to urinnell the second time was
because ot the college's large en-

dowment in a time when most
colleges were looking towards the
eighties as a decade to survive.
Grillnell had the resourses to work
on developing new- programs in
stead of cutting back. According
to brake, that "makes the Grill-

Andelson remarked that he did
not encounter that problem. since
he had already been teaching

college though. when he tried to

Jones said he did not have this
problem either. He recalled.

was much turmoil between the ad
ministration and the faculty. The
college had three different
presidents during that time. but
Drake says the students were
"almost oblivious" to the situa-
tion As for the interest today.
Drake [eels that “it is inherent in
an institution of this type for the
students and laculty to be
suspicious of the administration."

Since the mid-1970‘s when Kraft
graduated. he said student body
has become more diverse - with a
wider range or politics. personal

he welcomed this change and

Although student activism is not
at the level it was during his stu
dent years. he said that there i a
“long tradition of social activism

Andelscll stressed the benefit 01
the Grinnell experience outside
the classroom. stating his view
that "the most important educa
