Even profs need to meet

by Catherine ingraoeia

“Faculty Club" ~ these two
words. while standing alone, seem
innocent enough, but when put
behind the words “Grinnell Col-
lege” that same group or letters
manages to put unnecessary far
into the hearts of many on cams
pus, ‘

“Drinking Club”. “Fun House”
and scores of other deprecating
terms were ﬂed to describe the
proposed iaculty club (5&8
November 18, 1933). Such
puritanical rantings seem both
priggish and unthinking, especial-
1y from a student body that prides
itself on its openmindedness.

A iaculty club would provide the
iaulty with a deserved spot to
meet regularly with their col—

leagues on a social and profes»
sional manner; a manner not too
diiierent from the way students
gather in the Forum, the Pub,
Quad and essentially most of the
campus.

This type oi interdction is essen
tial to any group of peers, whether
faculty or student, providing
much needed thought, support
and stimulation. ,

Most colleges, universities and
even high schools provide their
staff with at least a room with a
coiiee pot and some chairs; a
room they can call their own
where they can momentarily
escape the everpresent student.
Grinnell provides nothing of that

sort, no one place specifically and
exclusively for {acuity members.
Undoubtedly there are times
when a professor would like to
leave his or her pile of papers and
just ‘talk shop’ with an intellec-
tual equal.

Suppose for a moment that you
were a professor teaching in the
middle of lower Underpaid, over-
worked and oiien surrounded by
demanding students, you might
appreciate some of the perquisites
an academic life affords — perks
often hard to come by in the corn-
fields.

Students expressed concern
that anvestablishment such as a
faculty club could damage

Some things can’t be stressed

by Barry Edwards

Academic stress is a problem
which we all have to confront
throughout our college careers.

Unfortunately we frequently
dismiss the familiar and
dangerous symptoms such as ire
ritability, headaches, ieelings oi
despair, and stomach pains as the
results of eating at Quad or
Cowles, An understandable error.

However hard stress is to hana
dle, it is much easier to take Care
of than the alternative. Both are
also unavoidable, unfortunately,

Maybe our mothers somehow
instill this characteristic within
our psyches to annoy us after we
leave their protective arms, Sort
of a built-in guilt trip, Something
to keep us from getting too much
sleep or having some fun on Sun
days (God iorbidl.

Next they will probably iind
some way of making us constantly
ask ourselves, “Are you dressing
warmly enough? Are you eating
right?" Until we are able to over-
come this psychological hold
which mothers mysteriously are
able to develop, we must deal with
these naggings as academic
stress.

I have decided that
the worrying and fright

which result from stress

must serve some purpose.

Although academic stress is
less oi a problem at the beginning
at a semester, it is always a worry
to some extent. of course, it gets
worse as the semester progresses,
and during exams. Well, we
would all rather not think about
exams

I have decided that the worry
ing and fright which result from
stress must serve some purpose,
though They are probably some
sort of academic selfapl‘eservatlon
instinct Therefore. lam sure that
stress is somehow useful

personally. however, i don't
like having a little voice inSidc my
head perpetually asking me in a
voice which sounds amazmgly
like my mother‘s. "Have you done
voui- homework yel"" 0r,
."You're going out7 Don't you
have a paper to \l'i‘iie""

The obvious solution to the
trauma of this stress is to stay
ahead in our classes. , . alright, so
itwon't happen. iiwe must get ab-
surdly behind (and I’m convinced
that we must) we need to develop
some way oi dealing with this evil
which is undoubtedly somehow
related to our consolcnce. (I’m
certain that there is a grand pura
pose behind consciences as well,
but i can't begin to guess what it
might be.)

since we are destined to
perpetually be waivering between
slightly and hopelcssly behind. it
seem - somewhat ioolhardy to con-
tinously torment ourselves (and
others: with our terrible sullen
lngs,

Maybe developing a sense oi
humor about the issue would help.

 

We could create liSG of our seem-
ingly endless amounts of work
(thereby proving to ourselves that
there is, indeed, an end, by the
way) and hang it on the wall
where we are likely to see it. Then
when we walk by, we can think
about the fact that proiessors ex-
pect us to iinish it on time, and
surely we can find at least a good
chuckle in that.

Or better yet, we could place the
list where we are likely to never
see it,

The curious thing is that we not
only volunteer for this anguish,
but we actually work hard in
order to be permitted to endure it
It’s an act which somehow

student-faculty relations,
“disuniting” the two. Those facul-
ty members desirous of a union
with students would probably pur-
sue it regardless of the presence
or a iaculty club. Similarly, ior
those who shun informal meetings
with students a faculty Club would
serve as a nice place to escape.

But those professors who enjoy
their students' company but
prefer to have a choice in the mat-
ter might look on a faculty club as
a fine option, giving them the best
of both worlds. By creating a
healthy more prosperous intellec-
tual environment ior our pro-
fessors we in turn create an at-
mosphere more conducive to lear—
ning overall.

reminds me of jogging.

when contemplating whether
we should actually finish a book
on time, it is sometimes useful to
consider whether finishing the
book is directly going to make the
world a better place. Or whether
anyone is going to care in ten thou-
sand years.

Of course, the iormer type of
logic tends to give one a rather
depressing outlook on life; maybe
stress is better, The solution I
always use is to constantly com»
plain about my work load. This
gives me a way to procrastinate
as well as insuring that no one else
is allowed to enioy themselves

The reactions to this issue in

ed by the Scarlet and Black, in-
dicate a kneejerk response to a
potential us-them situation that
need never exist. Such a response
reveals a narrowmindedness, in
security and possibly jealousy

that to a certain extent validates
the desire for a faculty club rather
than discredits.
