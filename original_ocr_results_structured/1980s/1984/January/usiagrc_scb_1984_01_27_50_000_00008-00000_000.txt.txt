George Kennan, who is at Grin-

Kennan was remarkably prophetic

in his early views of
US Soviet Relations

With some interruptions, Ken-
nan served in the Foreign Service
trom 1925-68, including duty as
ambassador to the Soviet Union
and ambassador to Yugoslavia.
Beyond this experience Kennan
has been a respected scholar oi
Russian and European history as
well as US-Soviet relations.

He has published works on a
wide range of topics including 19th
and 20th century Russian history
and American diplomatic history.
His avid interest in arms control
and armament is reilected in his
most recent, The Nuclear
Delusion. (Pantheon. $4.95).

Born and raised in Milwaukee,
Kennan attended Princeton and
entered the Foreign Service upon
graduation because he ieared

government and was remarkably
prophetic in his early views oi the
iuture oi US-Soviet relations. Ears
ly on he noted that a complex oi
geographical, historical, and
idealogical diiierences would
result in a “long series of
misunderstandings, disappoint
merits, and recriminations on boui
sides" oi the US~Soviet relation-
ship.

Despite these grim views on
politics, Kennan 7 throughout his
“Memoirs" — shows deep com-
passion tor the suiiering endured
by the Russian people; suttering
brought on by civil and world war
and and the excesses or a die-
tatorial government,

Throughout his diplomatic
career, Kennan tried incessantly,

in .oitice memoranda and
telegraphic cables, to call atten-

tional rut." Kennan soon enrolled

Kennan’s career dotted
with adventures

A career in the Foreign Services has many ups and downs, especially
ior George Kennan, one oi America's premier diplomats

Kennan's “Memoirs" (Panﬂleon, 38.95) are rich wlth stories, some
comical and some nearly tragic, about the adventures he had as a
Foreign Service oiiicer, For example:

7 He served in Berlin in 1941 and when the US entered the war, he and
130 other Americans were held captive in Germany, virtually iorgotten
by the US government Unlike the hostages in lran, these diplomats and
journalists did not receive special treatment aiter their release — in tact
the government reiused to pay them tor the time they were interned.

— Later in the war, while serving in Lisbon, Portugal, Kennan had to

misunderstanding caused when otticials at the Pentagon tailed to read a
telegram he had sent.

a In 1952, when Kennan was ambassadore to the Sovret Union, the
xenophobic Stalin government assigned three guards to “protect" him,
These unrequested bodyguards only spoke to Kennan once; to tell him
that his shoestring was untied.

Kennan believes that many oi the problems iound in us ioreign policy
making are caused by the inescapable contridiction between the national
interest and the narrow domesticpoliticui interests oi the leaders in
Washington.

As he said in his book, Kennan believes in the integrity oi the
diplomats, Kennan ieels that all too otten ioreign policy is tailorsmade to

American policies and to correct
the misperceptions which led to
these inadequacies. His tour ofdu—
ty in Moscow in 1944 was no excep-
tion.

Kennan’s knowledge oi Russian
history and iamiliarity with the
Stalin regime made him skeptical
oi the grand hopes ior US-Soviet
cooperation in the postwar yeais.
By 1946 it became apparent that
competition, not cooperation,
would characterize EastWest
relations,

in February oi that year Ken-
nan sent a bold, sharply worded
appraisal oi likely Soviet behavior
in the cold war. Although Kennan
now regards this telegram as
alarmist, at that time it was
periectly attuned to the oiiicial
outlook, He notes that. “The effect
produced in Washington by this
elaborate pedagogical effort was
nothing less than sensational."

ticle, were required reading tor

than of Soviet pwoer dominated US
ioreign policy throughout the late
19405 and 19503. It is because of
these essays that Kennan's name
is intimately associated with the
containment policy which main-
tained that agressive Soviet ac
tions must be thwarted wlth

[he Truman Doctrine

Much to Kennan's chagrin. the
American policy makers soon
viewed containment in purely
military terms and completely
neglected opportunities ior means

division oi Germany.

Although Kennan held nominalr
ly poweriul positions at the State
Department ioliowing the ivar, his
views had little intluence on the
hawkish cold war policy. Kennan

ment in 1953 and returned to
Princeton where he is now Pro
iessnr Emeritus.

In the last decade Kennan has
iocused his attention on nuclear
weapons and their importance in
the US—Soviet relationship. He is
deeply sympathetic with the
ireeze movement and has pers
sonally called tor a 50% across»

Kennan to national attention

In 1952 he served as am-
bassador to the Soviet Union for
five months. During this tenure he
became increasingly frustrated
