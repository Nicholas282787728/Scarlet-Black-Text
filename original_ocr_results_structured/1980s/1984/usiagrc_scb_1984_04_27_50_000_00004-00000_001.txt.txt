Surprise choice to ﬁll Afro

In a closed meeting last Thurse
day, the English department
along with President George
Drake and Dean Catherine
Frazer, appointed Grand Master
Flash. of the Grand Master Flash
and the Furious Five musical
group, as the new professor of
Afro-American Literature,

When asked what prompted the
move Drake responded, “Skip
Jive, what can 1 say. We just
made our minds up, we didn’t
play.”

Offering further explanation,
and sounding very excited,
English Department Chair
Elizabeth Dobbs added, “He’s full
grown, strong to the bone, he’s so
fine. he's one of a kind and Flash
is gonna rock your mind!"

Grand Master received his
B.M.F. (Bad Mother. . . ) from
the University of the south Bronx
in 1981 and Went on to concur a
PhD. at Oxford, where he, too,
ran track with Drake and Roger
Bannister.

Some flack was raised in the
Minority Affairs office over his
appointment, but LaVeta Small,
director, conceded that Master
would make a better professor
than the other candidat whose

theSls was on Baroque Medieval
Renaisaance lmpressionistlc Art
in the Third World,

Small put it this Way, “Like
dynamite before it blows, who
needs the band when the bent Just
goes "

In an emergency session, SGA
passed a resolution illtroduced by
Mears Ilall President Russell
Reamer, which denounced what
was worded as “Double reverse
discrimination," Reamer was
quoted as saying. “Come on, it
Weird Al Yankovic can imitate
Michael Jackson, Ed Moore can
teach AfrorAmerican Lit.”

As for studies, Grand Master
plans to scrap Ellison. Wright and
Angelou when he arrives because
their works contain too much unr
tapped literary value. He plans to
replace them with studies In
Modern Rapp, English 435 and one
course he titles “The Message.”

Prerequisites for both courses
will be the ability to recite the
words to “Rapper’s Delight” and
“White Lines” from memory,

When asked about these
changes, Professor Edward
Moore replied, “It should add a
refreshing touch to the cure
riculum currently offered ”

“Want lo rock on”

New curriculum proposal

has surprise author

In an extraordinary closed and
secret meeting on Thursday night,
the Grinnell College faculty voted
unanimously to adopt a radical
new curriculum embodied in the
socalled “Darcy Proposal."

As the facts emerge, those
associated with the College are
realizing that last night’s events
were significant for Grinnell’s
future. An administration source
even went so far as to say, “this is
really big, it probably has more
historical importance than the
Sports Symposium."

The history of the College ads
ministration’s strategy is shrouds
ed in mystery from the beginning.
The 5818 learned me details by ab-
taining a number 0! memoranda
which were ingeniously leaked by
the administration through meir
college computer accounts.

Curricular change was, aside
from organizing the Sports Sym»
pcsium, perhaps the main reason
George Drake was hired by the
college ﬁve years ago, according
to a classified memo. As
Grinnell's corporate overseers
placed their trust in Drake, the
new President secretly brought
ersatz Food Service employee
Darcy Noel onto the scene by
seriptin’ously putting her on the
food service staff.

" Noel, it turns out, is no ordinary
key punch operator. she was a
class-mate of Drake‘s at Oxford,

where she studied educational
philosophy. Following Oxford she
strayed from academia and work-
ed in Britain's secret intelligence
service, serving in East Berlin,
Casablanca and Teheran.

This background in undercover
operations, coupled with her
academic credentials, made Dare
cy an ideal choice for Drake, who
said, “I envisioned her role as
similar to the Lawgiver in
Rousseau's Social Contract; a
wise, scholarly observer capable
of viewing a society and then [or-
mulating a constitution for it."

The contents of the proposal
reveal how splendidly She fulfilled
this role. It calls for:

1. Tutorial requirement for all
freshmen. There must be at least

‘ 50 students in each class (a cost-

cutting measure to ax more of the
teaching faculty) and all evalua»
tion will be based on Standardized
multiple-choice examinations.

2. Drivers’ Education and Sex
Education will be offered as ma-
jors. All students must
demonstrate competence in both
areas before graduation,

3. Grinnell-in-London will
become Grinnellrinr
Marshalltown; the program will
feature weekly excursions to the
moviehouse, Baskin Robbins and
the Chinese restaurant.

4. The Sociology and American

Studies departments will be com-'

bined and then abolished
altogether. (Who's going to
notice?)

5. Sciences will become one
department and offer a single
course (optional to everyone) a
couple of times a week in the
afternoon. The college will “docs
tor” students‘ MCAT scores so
that anyone interested can go to
Harvard Medical School.

6, Horseshoes will become an in
tramural sport, Participation will
be mandatory.

The breadth and depth of these
proposals required prolonged cone
templation on Darcy‘s part and
thus Drake, fearing the impa-
tience of the Trustees, bought
time by initiating the Parslow pro-
posal. The extra time paid nif in a
big way on Tuesday. Darcy, after
punching in the final student for
lunch, forwarded the historic
memo to Nollen House.

The President loved it but was
unsure of the faculty response; he
concluded mat a secret meeting to
consider me plan with a surprise
speech by its author would repre-
sent an unstoppable tour de force
assuring ratiﬁcation.

\

Darcy agreed to speak on the
stipulation that “I will never work
Sunday Brunch again," and her
charismatic appeal brought one
house down.

An amendment establishing an
annual sports symposium was
defeated.

Strauber bound for

* Hollywood

After having put his current
sabbatical to good use job-
hunting, political Science prev
lessor lra Strauber recently in-
formed Department Chair H.
Wayne Moyer that he will not
return to campus next Fall in
order to take a more lucrative job
as judge on the popular television
show, “The People's Court.”

Strauber told Moyer that he was
not looking specifically for the
“People’s Court” job, but was im-
pressed by ﬂie offer made to him
by the show‘s producers. Apr
parently, the Hollywood ex»
ecutives were taken with
Strauber's forceful classroom
presence and thought it would
work well in the video court set
ting.

Steven Stevenson. a member of
the production consortium behind
the show; said. “Ira fit perfectly
into the image we had wanted to
create when Judge Wapner left
the show. We were looking for that
assertive, law and orderrtype
judge who knows exactly where
the problem is and how to resolve
it, quickly."

Added William Williamson,
another of the show’s executives,
”I’ve never seen a defendant
leave me court crying until it hap-
pened on Ira’s screen test, and the
defendant won his case! I'm
tellin' ya, this guy’s dynamite!
You don't go into Ira Strauber’s
court unless you’re prepared.”

The show‘s longtime presiding
judge, Judge “Judge Wapner”
Wapner, is stepping down from
the video bench this summer in
order to seek confirmation as a
Supreme Court Justice. Wapner
said he expected the appointment
to the nation's highest court, but

¥¥¥¥¥¥¥

nonetheless was honored that
President Reagan selected him,

“I can't say this is a total sure
prise," said the crusty justice,
who gave his age as “57. in TV
years,”

“You see, when my buddy Ed
Meese told me back in December
that his little boy. Beasley Meese,
wanted to go to boarding school in
California, I told Ed I’d take care
of everything. Tuition, books,
housing, the whole deal,“ said
Wapner. “It seemed like the nice
thing to do. Next thing I know, I’m
nominated for the Supreme
Court.”

When contacted by the Black
and Blue to comment on his new
job, Strauber said, “For what?
The B and B7 Forget it, go away.
And don't step on my lawn,
either."

Mayer expressed some concern
about replacing Strauber at this
late date, but indicated that
Strauber’s decision was not en~
tirely unwelcome.

"Sure, it’ll be a problem getting
someone to cover for lra on such
short notice," said Moyer. “But
the fact of the matter is it’s been a
problem having him around for so
long anyway, How would you like
to have that guy at your staff
meetings?

“All he ever wants to talk about
is the Yankees," continued
Moyer. “You know he actually
likes George Stienbrenner'l Ira
says he can identify with him."

Moyer, however, refused to
elaborate when he said, apparent-
ly by accident, “And how would
you like it ifyou got a call at 33m.
from some Freshman girl in
Langan asking you to come and
get Strauber out of_her room?
Whoops, I didn‘t say that.”
