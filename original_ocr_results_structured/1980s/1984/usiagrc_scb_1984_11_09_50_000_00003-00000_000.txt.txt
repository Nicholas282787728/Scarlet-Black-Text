ty member Craig Olzenak will ap-
pear as soloist in the latter work.

The program will open with
Franz Schubert's overture to his
opera “Die Zwillmgsbruder" (the
twin brotherst. D. 647. First per-
iormed in 1820. the opera is

representative oi the stage works
at Schubert‘s middle period.
Though initially wellrreceived,
Schubert himself disliked the
work and it is seldom performed
today The overture, however,
reflects the light, lyrical in-
strumental music that IS general-
ly considered to be the “Die Zwill-
iiigbruder's" sole redeeming
feature.

The largest work oi the pro
gram is Robert Schumann's
energetic Symphony No. i in B
ilat major ("Spring"). 0p 38.
Written towards the middle of
Schumann's career. the sym-
phony was iirst conducted by
Mendelssohn in 1341 From its

premiere, it was a great success.

sports several bright, accessible
themes

The program will conclude with
Karl Stamitz‘s Concerto in B llat
[or Clarinet and Orchestra. with a
slightly smaller ensemble from
the Orchestra accompanying Mr.
Olzenak. Written between 1773
and 1785 ior tworkey clarinet. the
concerto consists of a long allegro
movement. a short romance and a
closing Rondo in 6/9 meter. The
last movement Contains several
points oi articulation requiring
