Jimmy Blacksmith

Wildly praised by critics, “The Chant oi Jimmie Blacksmith” (1978) is
yet another poweriul iilm irom cinematically proliiic Australia. Written
and directed by Fred Schepisi, ”Chant” is adapted irom Thomas
Keneally’s novel based on the actual case oi Jimmy Governor. a hall-
aborigine who went on a rampage and killed seven whites in 1900, The
iilm is a harrowing indictment oi racism,

Jimmie Blacksmith (Tommy Lewis). a hallrwhite aborigine, is raised
by a Methodist minister who teaches him to be polite and docile. Deter-
mined to escape an aborigines usual iate, Jimmie goes out into the
world to work hard. buy land, and eventually marry a nice white girl.
Caught between two cultures, Jimmie is cruelly exploited by the penny
pinching white landowners ior whom he works. Trying desperately to
improve himseli and his lot. Jimmie is iinally driven to rebel out oi
helplessness and irustration, He explodes with dizzying speed. and it is
as it his unconcious has taken over,

Schepisi has expertly blended the periormances oi the white stage and
screen actors with those oi the non-proiessional aborigines who were
trained while the iilm was being made. This large-scale. visually impas
sioned epic will show Friday (tonighti. April is at 9:30 pm, in SL and Sun

The Wild Bunch

Sam Peckinpah‘s “The Wild Bunch" (1969) is a CODtI‘OVeX‘SIal lands
mark [ilm which set the fashion for excessive, bloody Violence in
westerns. it has been praised as a masterpiece and dismissed as a mean-
ingless exercise, and it is probably Peckinpah‘s greatest iilm.

The film is set in the Texas and Mexico or 1913 and tells the story of the
decline and tall oi an outlaw gang. Aiter a disastrous attempt at a rob-
bery in a small Texas border town. the Wild Bunch heads for Mexico for
one last outing where they are hired by a smilingly sadistic Mexican
general lighting Pancho Villa, The climactic massacre with its
choreographed brutality has been called a bloody ballet, and it so full of
genuine compassion that the viewer actually feels a sense of loss at the
death at each member of the group.

What begins as a realistic treatment and a dcglamorizatlon of warfare
which would show how gruesome killing really is becomes instead an
almost abstract fantasy about violence. The film is stylish, thoughtful,
and very exc ing. Peckinpah’s poetic bloodbaths are irightening and
beautiiul. This simple story or bad men in changing times can be seen

Monty Python and the
Holy Grail

Everything you ever wanted to know about the Holy Grail, King Ar»
thur, and me general mucking-about oi poets with the same old story can
be discovered in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail" (1974). The troupe's
second ieature, “Grail" is a hellzapoppinlike series of linked sketches
on a medieval theme.

The basic storyline (and I use the term loosely) is a cheery loused up
reworking of King Arthur’s Grail hunt. Throw in swallows, mud, young
and cloistered medieval blondes, extremely cowardly, dirty, and ille
starred knights, and credim in English, with quite unrelated subtitles
that make remarks about Swedish travel, written in an English which is
as though it were Swedish (reminiscent of Bergman), and what you have
is a film with some inspired lunacy, a lot of muddle, and an uproariously
iunny visual sense of the Middle Ages.

This tilm is a must ior Monty Python ians and can probably be enjoyed
by people who don’t mind il’ the Holy Grail is found or not. The movie
flounders and strays, and yet this is its particular charm, for the Monty
Python people are especially iunny when they make a mess of things.
“Grail" shows Saturday, April 7 at 10:30 pm, in ARH and Sunday, April
it at 7:30 pm. in ARH. 90 min,

Fitzcarraldo

The first entry in The German Film Festival is Werner Herzog's “Fitz-
carraldo” which is both the story of a madman and the product of a mad
man. The hell which Herzog went through to make this film is similar to
the hell which the film's main character goes through in order to drag a
steamboat over a mountain in the jungles of Peru.

“Fitzcarraldo” tells the story at an Irishman named Brian Sweeney
Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) but known as Fitzcarraldo, who is determined
to get rich in the rubber trade. However, Fitzcarraldo has no interest in
money for its own sake; his goal is to make enough money to build an
opera house in the jungle and bring Caruso to sing in it. Fitzcarraldo has
a tract of rubber trees which came cheap because the land is inaccessir
ble; however. Fitzcarraldo plans to eliminate this small inconvenience
by taking a large steamboat up one jungle river, hauling it in one place
over a mountain, and relaunching it on the river on the other side which
has access to his lands This quirky. fascinating, and stunning spectacle
Will show Thursday. Aprll 12 at 9: 0 Inn. in SL. 157 min.
