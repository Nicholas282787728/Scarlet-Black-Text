Horse Feathers

Hooray for whomever picked this year's Grinnell Relay’s filml Their
choice? None other than the hilarious and zany “Horse Feathers” (1932),
one of the Marx Brothers' funniest and most irreverant comedies. The
setting is academic, with emphasis on football, and the hijinks and antics
are refreshingly and familiarly collegiate

The Marx Brothers play their ususal assortment of wild characters:
Harpo is the dogcather who uses a butterlty net, Chici plays a boouegger
masquerading as an iceman and perhaps the most unbelievable of all,
Groucho is Professor Wagstaff, the newly elected president of Huxley
College,

In the opening scene, Groucho addresses the student body and explains
his policy in the song “Whatever it is, I’m Against It,” The scene can-
cludes with Groucho and the staff of Solemn and bewhiskered professors
breaking into song and dance, reminiscent of the finale of a musical com-
edy.

Groucho’s big goal is to beat rival Darwin U. in football; the corrupt
president will stop at nothing w find winning players to improve the
team and win. His Search leads him to a Speakeasy complete with sur-
reptitious entrances and exits and a secret password (swordﬁsh) re
quired at the door. Although mute, Harpo has no trouble gaining en,
trance because he just flashing his fish with a sword in its mouth, Of
course, the big climax is the football game, where Groucho sports
headgear and morning coat, ready to cheat and foul for his beloved Hux-
ley.

With at least one bright gag or line to the minute and lively musicial in-
terludes, “Horse Feathers” is probably the Marx Brothers’ wildest yet
most streamlined series of escapades. This implausible, nonsensical,
and thoroughly delightful flick will show Friday (tonight), April 21 at
midnight in ARIL 68 min.

The Exterminating Angel

On a more serious note is “The Exterminating Angel" (1962), one of
Spanish Director Luis Bunuel's key films, In “Angel," master surrealist
Bunuel wryly assaults bourgeois idealogy, disciplinary conventions, and
conformity by leaving pure reason behind and delving into the irrational
and the absurd.

“Angel" begins inconspicuously enough with high society aristocrats
arriving at the Mexico City mansion to have dinner after the opera. They
have Just set foot in the door when the angel of the bizarre slips amongst
them. The guest discover that they are inexplicably unable to depart.
Humor, patience, and manners surrender to anger and cruel Competi-
tion, as the guests try to make the best ot their mysterious imprison-
ment

Hunger, and even possibly cannibalism, is averted by the timely ar-
rival of a flock of sheep, while a bear romps in an adjoining room, The
angel of the bizarre has turned into the Exterminating Angel, Fetishes
and hallucinations develop. Finally by retracing the events which led up
to the suspension of time and re-enacting them, the guest are able to
break the spell and free themselves, They attend mass to give thanks,
and fine themselves unable to leave the church,

The film's expressive form is such that realism and fiction combine to
produce pure absurdity without the fllm ever being anything but every-
day. This tacinating surrealist fantasia shows Friday ttoniglitt, April 27
at 9::m p.ni. in SL and Saturday, April 28 at 81.10 p.ni. in SL, 95 mi .

Caddyshack

For all those fans out there of such films as “Aminal House" and
“Meatballs,” then “Caddyshack” (1930) 7 a sort of “Animal House
Goes To The Country Club” -is a must this weekend, “Caddyshack”
has some impressive credits: he movie’s director, Harold Reims. not
only corwrote the script to “Caddyshack” but also the script for “Animal
House;” one of the other writers, Brian DoylenMurray, is the brother of
Bill Murray who is in the film, and the cast includes such wellrknown
bumblers as Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight.

The plot of “Caddyshack” is basically inane, The hero (Michael
O'Keefe as a caddy who needs the financial backing of Knight) is ap
propriately bland, alld the burning question of who will win the climactic
golf game is really of no interest to anyone. What makes “Caddyshack”
worth seeing is the cast of flamboyant supporting characters, which in
cludes Ted Knight as the country club's starchlest and snobbiest
member, Chevy Chase as a nonchalant playboy and Bill Murray as the
club’s assistant greenskeeper and slobrinrresldence who spends the en
tire movie mounting a military attack on an impudent giant gopher.

Rodney Dangerfield also stars as the club‘s plaidclad, nouveau riche
boor, a most endearing loudmouth who is inclined to Say such things as
“This steak still has the marks where the jockey hit it,” The film's most
inspiredrmoment moment is a total non sequitor 7 a parody of ”Jews”
involving a Baby Ruth candy bar and a pool of terriried swimmers.

”Caddyshack" is a looselinlbed and easygoing sort of film which is
dominated by Daiigerlield's wonderfully vulgar presence This slobs vs.
snobs parody is showing Saturday. April 23 at 10:00 p.' . iii ARH and
