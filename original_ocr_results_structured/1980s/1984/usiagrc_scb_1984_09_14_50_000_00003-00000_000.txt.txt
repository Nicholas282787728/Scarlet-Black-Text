tempting to analyze the Hitchcock
style have attempted to establish
connections between the man and
his works They cite everything
irom his lower~class Roman
Catholic background to the eiiects
oi his authoritarian upbringing to
his childhood interest in murder
trials to his relationship with his

periments iroin a suitor tClaude Raines). The operation is complicated
by the romance between Bergman and the American agent also assign-
ed to the case, played by Cary Grant.

The story line vtas constructed in 1945 before the atomic bomb \tas
dropped on Hiroshima l-litchcock originally planned the use ol uranium
tor a weapon to add a science tiction element to the trim He later came
under suspicion hinisell for having information about American atomic
weapons.

Notorious is best remembered for the famous kissing scene. The
Hollywood censors iii the 1940's were extremely strict about kissing in
motion pictures. A screen kiss could not last more than three seconds,
hitchcock tilined Bergman and Grant kissing vthile nibbling on each
othei ears. whispering suectrnolhings. even talking on the telephone.
Thi. technique adhered to the three second rule. but the overall chest
was the most risque kissing scene llollyviood had witnessed at that

in the guise oi a goathcrd. Besides the servant inevitably retei-i-ing to
the owner oi the island as "boss'i, he spends an inordinate amount ot
time playing music to his goats,

One oi the limés the main character decides to tamper with the

simply stands on a clili and stares out at the water taccompanied by
eerie music. oi courset; immediately. the water starts churning and

Hats oil to the people on the iilm selection committee ior conceiving
the/"Visions ot the Future” series. Last week -- isions oi the Future"
brought us "Metropolis". and this week it graces us with one at the truly
classic scirii comedies oi our time. sleeper.

steeper IS not only one oi Woody Allen's best. but also is one at his
most outrageous iilms. Allen plays "mild~mannered" Miles Monroe.
health store entrepreneur and jazz musician. who is put into deep irceze
during his ulcer operation. Miles wakes up in the year 2m in a bizarre
tlrwellian society under the dictatorship oi a nose

Obviously with a setting like that. Allen takes the audience on a
hilarious trip into the iuture. The only thing that we can be sure oi is that
somewhere. somehow. Miles will meet a beautitul. young. artsy typc
played by Diane Keaton.

sleeper is a tour star movie in my book; with an Oscar winning per»
iormance tor should have beeni by Miles‘ pet dog Rags twooi Woot‘l,

sleeper shows at 9:30 Friday 'night in rum and 9:00 Sunday night in
