The need fer student activists

A story in last Thursday’s Des Moines Register pro-
claimed this to be “an era when student activism is
decidedly out of fashion,” The article goes on to chronicle
the travails of three “radical” student activists at Iowa
State University and how the increasingly conservative
student body thought their ideas and actions were no
longer appropriate; that activists ”are a vanishing
breed."

God help us.

The situation at Iowa State is probably not quite an ac-
curate reﬂection of attitudes at other universities and col-
leges in Iowa and the rest of the country since ISU is
generally regarded as a conservative school. However, it
would not be outlandish to suggest mat the Register‘s
story reflects an established trend across the country’s
colleges. On the whole, this generation’s parents were
more outspoken and “radical” (a word that itself has lost
the honor it once had) than we are.

Is the apparent passing of the age of the student activist
a reality? Are we, as Grinnellians, collegians and
members of a far larger community of citizens, part of
this disturbing trend towards ready acceptance of our role
in a society over which we never attempt to control?

For several weeks now, the issue of feminism has gobbl-
ed up large chunks of space in this paper. The argument
seems to revolve around the question of whether society

can accept a statement of individuality, especially when

that statement offends our tranditional sexual expecta»
tions. Activism is an expansion of this argument, going
beyond just die issue of sexuality to include any pertinent
social or political issue and then acting on it Activism is
more than the absence of apathy; it is the presence of in-
volvement. .

Believe it or not, student activists are still with us. Grin-
nellians were very active in the caucuses this week, they
continue to protest at the nuclear base in Omaha, they still
are supportive of a divestiture of share of corporations in
South Africa and they firmly exercise their freedom of ex-
pression

Activisim is alive and well at other school as well, as in—
dicated by the actions of a group of students at Amherst
College earlier this week Angered by an administrative

decision that threatened to affect their way of life at the
school, the students staged a sit- down strike in the presi-
dent’ s office to protest. Of course, it may seem a bit silly
to us that the students were protesting a rule disallowing
campus fraternities but at least we can be heartened that
students still protest disagreeable establishment edicts

It is this word “radical”, though, that continues to give
us problems. Instead of connoting the traditional meaning
of favoring basic societal or economic change, the word
especially when it precedes the term “student activist”,
takes on a violent, anarchic tinge that few people want or
deserve to be labeled. Yesterday’s radicals — the Yippies,
the Black Panthers 7 are all gone now and we tend to
regard them as frenzied social aberrations. Who today
wants to step back into that form?

Nonetheless, there has to be a place today for student
activists, even if some insist on calling them radical. Sure,
times have changed and our priorities have become
somewhat rearranged. But simply accepting the way of
the establishment without much thought, without much
concern for what is truly right, will never be acceptable
and it is the student activists — today’s campus dinosaurs
— who will remind us of our obligations to those concerns.

A few points to remember

At the risk of implying that the issue is completely settl-
ed, we thought it appropriate to reﬂect on the decision to
reduce the activities counselor position by half and the
subsequent negotiations with Georgia Dentel.

First, it still seems odd that a 23—year employee whose
work has been recognized by Billboard magazine for its
high quality should now have her pay reduced by half. The
position held by the administration is that the cut was
purely economic in nature and — at least for the record —
is not a reflection of Dentel’s job performance. However,
comments made during the contract negotiations by ques-

tioning administrative personnel certainly made the ad-
ministration‘s assertion less strong.

In addition, administrators insist down the list the ac—
tivities program will not suffer by asking only approx~
imately halfrtime for the activities counselor. The ad.
ministration has not consulted an outside evaluator to
determine for certain how good the current program is
and whether the quality can be maintained with a half-
time position. For her part, Georgia has the opinions of
Billboard magazine and other industry professionals to at—
test to her performance and she sees the possibility of a
potential decline in program quality with the position be-
ing cut.

The final point to be made here is one that the 8&8 did
not fully expect when it began coverage of this matter four
weeks ago. That is, it is doubtful if anyone who ‘has
become involved with the matter, including the 5&3, has
found the situation to be anything short of unpleasant and
distasteful. Comments over the phone, allegations and
countercharges in interviews, attacks in print; we’ve had
it all this past month. While this case may be unusual in
the bitterness it has caused at times, it is still a shame that
there has been so much polarization and conflict.

It seems as though most people simply hoped that both
sides could get things worked out to their mutual satisfac-
tion. Well, at this point things are almost worked out. Are
both sides satisfied? That s not likely“ ‘ , .

Turning

the

feminist

tables

by John Sbarbaro

As of late, the old feminist issue
again has raised its head on the
Grinnell campus. We all know the
argument: “Social pressures on
women force them to behave con
trary to their personal beliefs, i.e.
social pressures force women to
coniorm to social norms," They
(ardent feminists) argue that it is
hard to be a liberated women in
today’s highrpressured society.

Well it's time men had their fair
say, and ladies, its just as tough
on men. I would reconstruct last
week’s topical question to read:
“Can real men shave their legs
and wear cosmetics?" You claim
that you get “nasty” stares and
are subject to “rude” comments
when you don’t shave your legs,
Whatever looks you get are
nothing compared to those that
men receive when they shave
their legs, The looks that men
receive would best be described
as “Inlerestmg” and the com-
ments “traumatizing.”

The same holds true for
cosmetics, At least you have the
opportunity to improve your looks
should you so desire; however
men have no such choice
Cosmetics are for women, “real
men” do not wear rouge and lip
gloss. Because of socxety’s
pressure, we male ugly duckiings
have no hope oi turning into
beautiful swans.

You claim that more is pressure
on you to stay in the home, and be
“propercaring” mothers {or the
children. A similar pressure is ex-
erted on men to be successful in
the outside world. God only knows
how many men out there are in-
hibited from staying at home, and
thus prevented from experiencing
domestic pleasures.

Feminlsts argue that things will
be iair when women can run
around on Wall Street hairy and
shoeless. We say that things will
be [air when male nurses can
work in hospitals without verbal
harrassment from coworkers,
and when male secretaries can go
to work with a feeling of self
esteem.

The bottom line is that men do
not really have a free choice: it is
conform, or be subject to disap-
proval Sure you may think that
we are ireely choosing our
lilestyles, as well as deciding such
world-shaking questions as
whether to shave our legs or wear
cosmetics, but are we?

In conclusion, I guess we all
have to deal With society‘s
pressures, regardless of kind or
form. It is a fast and rapidly
changlng world out there, and
nobody gets an easy go of it, but
part oi being liberated is being
able to handle those pressures,
Whether male or female, if you
are truly liberated, you are going
in do what you want 7 regardless
of social norms.
