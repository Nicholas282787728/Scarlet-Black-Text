Running a bakery and bakery runs

it is 2 am and suddenly you
have an irresistible urge tor some
delicious homemade pastries, hot
from the oven. 50, what do you
do" Well. If you are willing to ven-
ture out, you can go on a "bakery
run” to Danish Maid Bakery.

Many students feel that the
bakery run is a necessary part or
the “Grinnell Experience ” For 17
years. Danish Maid. located on
Fourth Avenue. has opened its
back door. starting at 2 a m. tor
college students to buy lresh bake
ed pastries,

“It's worth going out at 2 3m
because there is nothing like the
pastries iresh out or the oven.
Words cannot do justice to their
taste,‘ ommented John Aregood

William Hansen and fits Wife
bought the bakery from his lather
who founded the bakery in 1949,
Monday through Saturday baked
goods are offered tor sate atz a in.
The bakery opens up (or regular
business at 5:30 a m. and closes at
5:30 pm. Monday through Friday
and 5 pm. on Saturday.

The bakery sells doughnuts.
bismarks. cream putts. cupcakes.
cookies. rolls. buns. brownies, tur»
hovers. bread. longhorns. orange
juice, milk. and more. Prices
vary. starting at 12 cents for cer-
tain kinds of cookies.

Hansen explained that fewer
students come now than when the
bakery tirst opened up to them in
the wee hours of the morning.
”There used to be a line out the
back alley." he said,

Jon Norton explained one
reason why he has never made
“the run”, “I have never been on
a'hakery run because I‘m either
asleep. or it I'm not asleep, I'm
working on a paper which is due
the next day and i don’t have time
to leave."

But. many students have taken
advantage or the late night tor
earlyt offer, There is a set ritual
to going on a bakery run." Charles
Landauer asserted. “The room in
the bakery is so small that you
have to hand baked goods down
tlieline tuithsoropcoplet.andof
course you only take fresh stuff."

Landauer also said that after
filling your bag. it is essential to
go to the trout and get milk or
orange Juice. Alter paying. Lane
dauer explained. “you go sit down

on the curb in hunt and devour his
glorious pastries," He said he has
made the run over a dozen times,

Hansen said it all started when
a student came in to watch the
pastries being made in the late
Sixties. Alter Watching most 01 the
night. the student asked it he
could purchase some at them. The
word spread around campus that
they could buy these treshly bake
ed goods and the tradition was
started.

“It doesn't bother me.” said
Hansen. "It's nice to have some
company."

The people of Danish Maid were
made honorary members of the
Grinnell College Class of 1976.
They were presented a certificate
that signifies this honor which
now hangs on the wall in the
bakery.

One student. Chris Chadbourne.
said the only complaint he had
was that. “We wanted a bakery
run Sunday morning. but e
couldn't because it wasn't open."

Mark Richmond summed it all
up by saying. "They have pretty

were delicious There ain't

A view from
behind the polls

by Shelly Welsh and
Weston

No one really talked about the
twentyecar train wreck. We know
they saw it because it was beside
the civic center. And we know
they were at the civic center
because they were voting.

Going to ’l‘ama county on elec-
tion day. we witnessed and took
part in the dealings of politics in
small town lashion. Brietly. we
poll-watched for} the Democratic
party. which meant that we kept a
card file record of Democrats who
had voted. Also. by telephone. we
reminded all registered
Democrats to vote.

Tama county is mid-America.
Tama township is SMALL. We
thought the people in Tamil. like
in any small town. would be
rather unconcerned with the welle
being oi their country. However.
they weren‘t.

By poll watching, we came in
contact with many of the people
we had previously called. We mat~
ched faces to names and aspects
of their character to their faces;
furthermore, we matched these
aspects at their character to their
votes.

Not only did we see the people.
we saw their homes. families. and
their dogs. The Democratic headr
quarters were entirely in their
homes. We drove their cars and
ate their lasagna, that we heated
in their microwaves. They trusted
us to phone registered Democrats
from their empty homes.

One of us used the key that was
under the mat to get in and called
while the dog slept, the tire burn-
ed in the tireplace and no one was
home. The entire process was
very personal and simple,

They were interested, Despite
the fascination of thc 207car train
wreck. the people of ’l‘ama took
the time to vote and demonstrate
political awareness. Reagan won;
Jcpsen lost.
