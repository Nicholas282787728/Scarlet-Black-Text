Reagan, I Mondale clash in
the first of two debates

by K l'llh’l “’oito

clashing on economic and social
issues. President Ronald Reagan
and Walter F. Mondale debated
last sunday night in the tirst of
two debates sponsored by the
League at Women Voters The se-
cond debate. to be held october 2i.
in Kansas city. Mo. will deal with
torcign policy issues.

this past week in Louisville,
Ky., President Reagan and Mr.
Mondale responded to questions
Irom tliree journalists. Diane
Sawyer trom cas, Fred Barnes or
the Baltimore Sun iiml James G,
wiegliart ot Surlppsrlloward
Newspapers.

the debate was moderated by
Barbara Walters. a correspondent

O. K. .
Who Is the
Real Boss?

Prior to the oilici'oil debates.
President Ronald Reagan and
Democratic Nominee. Walter
Mondale. had a little verbal teter
a-tctc ot sorts in New Brunswick.
N. J.

The tollovving is an excerpt from
Mondale‘s speech in the town on
October 1,

two weeks ago. Mr. Reagan
came to thi Jersey and tried to
steal one 01 New Jcrscy's most
important heroes: Bruce Springs»
teen. He came and quoted Bruce's
"message of hope."

\iell. Bruce may have been
litirii tti Itini. but he wasn‘t born
yesterday.

And \tlicn Brtlcc heard what
M r Reagan had said, here's what
the Boss had to say to him:
"There's something really
dangerous happening out there
We're slowly getting split into two
Americas there's a promise
being broken. l don't think the
Amcrican Dream was that
everyone was going to. .make a
billion dollars. But it was that
everyone was going to have an op-
portunity and the chance to live a
life with some decency and some
dignity and a chance for some
sellrrespect "

That's the real Bruce Springs-
teen

Not only is he trying to steal
Bruce Springsteen. he's trying to
steal our Democratic heroes.

A low weeks ago. he went up to
Waterbury. Connecticut. and he
said he really liked John F, Ken-
nedy. And he reminded them at
the night John Kennedy gave his
last campaign speech in that come
munity. i remember that night
and so does Mr. Reagan.

(in that evening, 1 was chair
man ol Minnesotans [Dr John F.
Kennedy. And he was chairman of
something called Democrats {or
Nixon. ,

Thank God i had my nay and he
didn't. . s

(or ABC news. Interestingly
enough. Walters scolded the aud-
ience twice for it's inexcusable
perlormance as they clapped
in support for either president
Reagan or Mr Mondale. Walters
also noted liow regrettul it was
that the candidates could only
agree on 3 journalists for the
panelists from a list oi over loo
well-qualiﬁed journalists.

Mondale. trailing behind 23
points in the New York
Times/CBS News Poll. came of!
strong and persistent Reagan.
trom newspaper sources and
Grinnell student response, fared
poorly in 'the face oi this per-
sistence as he was caught on the
defensive on several occasions, To
be sure. he appeared less contir
dent than he has in previous cam-
paign appearances,

Mondale proved to be qutte a
challenger as he turned in one or
his most vigorous campaign per-
formances ln one instance. Mona
dale challenged Reagan to tell
how he would reduce the budget
delicits and accused him of Li
failure of leadership in the bomb-
ings 01 American installations in
Lebanon,

Striking back. Reagan's
greatest appeal was heard only in
the early part at the debate as he
asked. ”Are you better off than
you were [our years ago?“

Questions ﬁelded by Reagan
and Mondale were based on con»
troversial topics such as the
deficits and the budget. leader-
ship quatities, the impact of
religion. the changing electorate.
the abortion issue. the relief of the

poor, and the cantttdates' views of
each other,

llarping on the economic well.
being of the country. Reagan
said that he has reduced inflar
tion to a third of vthal it had been
at the start of his l'irst term The
interest rates have come down 9
or it) points and six million people
have received jobs. he asserted

Reagan continued. “So we
believe that as we continue to
reduce the level of Government
spending, the rate of increase in
Government spending: and the
same time as the growth in the
economy increases the revenues
the Government gets without raise
ing taxes. those‘ two lines will
meet.“ Reagan does not take the
Congressional Budget ()l'tice's
predictions seriously which say
that by 1939 the deﬁcit will be $273
billion. He said. “If the rate of in
crease in Government spending
can be held to 5 percent » by 1989
that would have reduced the
budget deficiB down to a $30
billion or $40 billion level." A 4
percent recovery will mean mo
billion more in Government
revenues, he said.

Mondale turned the deficit ques
tion into one ot leadership, He said
"We were told we would have a
balanced budget in 1983. It Was a
$200 billion defictt insteads And
now we have a major question l'ac-
ing the American people.”

“I think this is a test of leader»
ship and 1 think the American peo-
ple know the dilterence.” Mon-
