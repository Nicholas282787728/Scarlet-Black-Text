Giving McGovern another chance

by Barry Edwards and Dave
Simon

The United States’ nuclear
arsenal is the greatest potential
crime against humanity — ever.
Only George McGovern proposes
an immediate unilateral freeze on
nuclear arms. Only McGovern
proposes a decrease in military
spending. Only McGovern is for
an immediate withdrawal of all
US. forces from Central
America.

Radical? Yes; but only radical
methods can deliver the U.S. and
the world from the disastrous cons
dition which we are rapidly being
led toward, McGovern. however,
is not foolish. He does want
bilateral disarmament, but he will
come to the bargaining table with
an already enacted unilateral
freeze as an incentive to the
negotiations. An incentive which
the Soviets are certain to respect
7 a proposal which the Soviets

need to consider.

Steven Pearlstein of the Boston
Observer writes, “Can there be
any doubt that George McGovern
is the genuine peace candidate in
the field? By comparison, Alan
Cranston looks like a pale, selfr
righteous copy." And, McGovern
has ieasible proposals to correct
all aspects oi an ailing America.

The McGovern
lo-Point Program:

1) End all us military opera»
tions in Central America, NOW.

2) Bring the Marines home from
Lebanon, Now,

3) Begin a nuclear freeze, NOW.
Cancel the B-1 Bomber, the MX
missile, and other military boon~
doggles. End waste in Pentagon
purchasing. Cut military spending
by 20 to 25 percent below Praia
dent Reagan‘s budget. Each of the
other Democratic candidates
agrees Wltl‘i President Reagan —
spend as much or even more

money next year on the military
than was spent this year.

4) Put unemployed Americans
back to work, Now. Create real
jobs cleaning up the environment,
rebuilding water and sewer
systems, roads and bridges using
money saved by military budget
cuts. Make our railroads the best
in the world by the year 2000.

5) Stop paying iarmers not to
produce and start paying them a
fair price for food to win the battle
against hunger in America and
the world. Reestablish the 90 per-
cent parity price support pro-
gram. Declare an immediate
moratorium on farm foreclosures.
Oppose any grain embargo.

6) Restore the dream of home
ownership and revive the con-
struction industry with one-time,
governmentrbacked mortgage
loans of not more than 10 percent.

7) Simplify the us. Tax code,
close the loopholes that favor corv

porations and the wealthy, and
establish lower rates for most
Americans.

8) Guarantee equal rights for all
Americans, especially the majoris
ty of which are women. Pass the
ERA.

9) Offer lowscost loans for
education and job training to all
Americans Provide for fair and
reasonable repayment through in-
come tax withholding.

10) Release state funds for imr
proving education and crime con-
trol by turning the full cost of
welfare and Medicaid over to die
iederal government.

McGovern is respected
throughout the American govern-
ment, and he is electable. Voters
must stop using inelectablility as
an excuse not to vote for him. As
McGovern said in the Des Moines
debate, “Don't throw away your
conscience,”

Drake defends

Tederman

To the Editor,

In my fourrandone-half years
as Grinnell’s President occa-
Slonally l have been tempted to
write to the 5&8 editor to correct
an error or to justify a position,
but until now, I have resisted that
temptation, However, I cannot
help responding to Dan Klatz’ at-
tack on Dean Jim Tederman,

l have the utmost respect ior
Jim Tederman, He is the best
Dean of Students 1 ever have seen
and by all odds the best that l have
worked with. His judgment is
unusually sound and always he
puts the interests of students and
the institution (in that order)
ahead oi personal preference. His
dedication to Grinnell and other
students is unsurpassed by
anyone at this college, I‘m proud
to work with him and when he
makes a recommendation I know
that it is based on sound Judgment
and knowledge as well as his
analysis of what is best for the coir
lege and its students

Though the Scarlet and Black is
not the proper forum to discuss
the details of negotiations with
MS. Dentel, i want to clarify one
point raised by Mr. Klatz, He and
i did indeed discuss the February
10th deadline and I recall saying
that because of the complexities
oi negotiation, ipresumed that we
might have to extend the deadline.
When Mr. Tederman and 1 last
had talked, the assumption was
that February low was to be Hie
deadline. so that he was correct in
mentioning that date to the
Scarlet and Black editor, Jeff
Raymond. ii anyone was
mistaken, it was l [or having
speculated that probably the
original date (which had been
given to Ms. Dentel) would not
hold.

The charges against Mr, Teder-
man are unfair and i know that
those who have worked with him
will be the first to say so. 7

Another look

at pornography

To the Editor,

An individuals taste should not
be subject to social approval or
restricted to what any group
classifies as acceptable Kary
Koon’s letter in the la February
issue oi the ssh recommends cens
sorship oi pornography as a solu

tion to violence against women
and as a means to dispel
unrealistic sexual myths concern-
ing women, Censorlng por-
nography will neither prevent
anti-social behaVlor nor alter sex7
ual prejudices. The greater
danger to society is the suppres-
sion of thought, no matter how
“unpleasant” certain thoughts
may be.

There are those who Cannot
avoid the term “genre” when
discussing sexually explicit films
and there are those who cannot
avoid criticizing pornography
unobjectively. The opinions ex-
pressed in Karry Koon’s letter
represent the latter prejudice.
First of all, there is no study
which conclusively proves that ex
posure to pornography induces
antisocial behavior. Given the
diiiiculty oi conducting research
in this area, such evidence may
never be obtained. in iact, some
studies suggest that pornography
is a saiety valve which may pre
vent wouldrbe rapists from who
sumating their heinous fantasies.
There is clearly not enough infers
mation to resolve the issue of
whether or not obscenity pro-
motes violence against women,

Secondly, the flesh industry
thrives in the United States
because Americans are a sexually
ignorant and repressed people. A
sexually liberated nation such as
Denmark makes no value
Judgements on what is visually or
conceptually immoral. As a coir
sequence, Danish culture
is characterisically relaxed and
nonviolent, Nazi Germany. on the
other hand, outlawed por-
nography to protect morality and
eventually outlawed “obscene"
political commentary to protect
the government. it pornography
were to be abolished in Min-
neapolis as oiiensive to women, a
hypothetical group of parents in
that city could not be prevented
from banning Our Bodies. oiir
Selves as offensive to their
children

Pornography does perpetuate
damaging myths concerning
female sexuality, yet it also
slanders male sexulaity. When
was the last time you saw a sen
sitive male character portrayed
in a skin flick? Or how abouta guy
with a penis which was minutely
smaller than a flashlight? Women
have no exclusive claim to
unrealistic representation in the
media Pornography degrades
both women and men. For this
reason porn cannot be legislated
into oblivion as a civil rights ole
iense against women, obscene
literature and films will remain
popular in the United States until

individuals overcome sexual
neurosis. Cultural values create a
market for pornography.

These same cultural values. not
pornography, cause anti-social
behavior, Dispelling sexual myths
and preventing violence against
women demand a radical
modification in the traditional
American conception of human
sexuality. This modification will
be achieved through education,
understanding, and intellectual
freedom. Censorship -oi‘ por»
nography would indirectly con-
tribute to sexual neurosis by stil'lr
ing critical thought “Suppress
sion,” wrote Spinoza, “is the pars
ing down of the state till it is too
small to harbor men of talent.”
Talented men and women, not
censorship, will reduce sexual ig-
norance an repression, As sexual
ignorance and repression become
obsolete, pornography will cease
to exist as an institution. 7 Danny

Society and
feminism

To the Editor:

To shave one’s legs, or not to
shave one’s legs? To wear a
business suit to a meeting of the
board of directors at Citicorp or to
opt ior a more casual leisure
number? To bathe or not to bathe?
in each oi these cases, society has
dictated a ‘preferred’ response.
Those who wear business suits to
board meetings, and certainly
those who bathe, are not branded
by selfrappointcd visionaries as
‘coniormists’ and judged lesser
human beings. And yet a brand of
feminism has arisen that declares
that women who shave their legs
cannot be regarded as ‘true
feminists and therefore are
either to be pitied or despised.

Once again, feminism is (at
least on the surface) the issue,
and we seem to be back where we
started. for this letter is intended
as a rebuttal oi Mary Jane Cons
[ant and Anne Wibiralske's rebut-
tal of Catherine lngrassia’s arti-
cle “Mixing Feminism with
Femininity.”

As distasteful as a group or
“Grinnell liberals" might find it
to be classified With such right
wingers, the problem that Ms.
Constant and Ms. Wiblralske face
is comparable to that faced by
certain fundamentalist religious
organizations. Like those
‘religions’ who only recognize con
version under their terms, under
their dogma, these feminists have

concocted a set of ideals to which
anyone who would be worthy oi
the title ‘feminist' must adhere.
Shave your legs? Sorry, lady, but
go and get your consciousness
raised 7 then come back and try
again.

Ms. Constant and Ms.
Wibiralske correctly contend that
modern standards oi beauty have
been created and are upheld by a
male dominated society. True
enough, but ultimately irrelevant
in Ms. CBzW’s own words, ”one
should be aiming at being attrac»
tive to herseli, however it is that
she finds herself attractive and
comfortable." SO be it, but let us
please bear in mind that all
women who choose to shave their
legs do so not because they are
tragic, oppressed ieminine ‘pro-
letariats’ suffering at the cruel
hand of a male ‘patriarch' but
because they iind themselves “at
tractive and comfortable” that
way, the origin oi the concept of
shaved legs entirely notwithstans
ding.

The point is that. I am sure.
neither Ms. lngrassia nor myseli
would be so crass as to suggest
that a woman must shave her
legs. The unfortunate fact is that
Ms. ccw are saying thatshe must
not. A Woman who decides to
leave her legs hairy with the flim-
sy reason that ”it's the feminist
thing to do,” or “I’m making a
statement,” is, in her trite form of
rebellion, submitting to an
equivalent iorce to that oi
“societal pressure.” Torn Rub-
bins. author of Even Cowgirls Get
the Blues, defines this ugly iorce.
“The enemy of women is not men
We all have the same enemy, The
enemy is the tyranny oi the dull
mind."

In the end, the cause of
feminism will be more hindered
than helped by those who see it as
nothing more than a conflict of
smooth vs. hairy legs The effort
to resist all things masculine by
misguided militant feminists is as
repugnant and poisonous as the
suppression of all things feminine
(not stereotypicaily ieminine, but
truly feminine) by the misguided
male chauvinst pig The “true
l'eminisl,’ not as deiined by Ms.
Constant and Ms, Wlbiralske, but
defined as the woman who is com-
fortable with her Elf, her sex, and
her place in the world as she sees
it, who perceives herseli as an
equal to all oi both genders. who
fosters neither affected devotion
to ridiculous dogma nor in»
discriminate disdain for an entire
gender, will certainly not count as
a major criterion the wooly/bar-
ren state of her lower limbs. 7
