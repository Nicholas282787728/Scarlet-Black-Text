D0 students feel victimized in town?

by Leisu t'lieric Kilctlle

Douglas O'Brien was assaulted
in town on August 23th. O'Brien. a
[irmllell College student, had been
here less than a week.

His attack was the latest in a
recurring series which prompted
this investigation on student.
ttinnspcople confrontations
sheriff Max Allen of Powcshiel-t
County. has observed these intcrr
inlttent cotilrontatlons since he
ll 1. became a law enforcer in
19 i. llc remarked that even in the

s whcti tirinncll college was
seen as a conservative institution.
there were ocL sional lights bet
ween college students and
townspeople.

ltt lttsti. "a big i-tlw started up on
a street corner in the middle of the
day for no reason at all,” Allen
said.

During the late 605 though.
when the college attitudes l‘adicalr
ly diverged. irom those in town.
there was not a signiticant rise in
studentrtownspeople confronta»
tions. Usually the townspeople in»
volved are males in the 17-23 age
bracket otten these people are
just out of high school and in tran-
sition. Allen said. In the lights that
occur. the numbers or townspeo-
ple is usually greater than college

students.

Most ul the time according to
Allen. no one in cithcr party is
drunk. just intoxicatcd enough to
make both parties less iiihibitcd.
surprisingly. these tights rarely
happen in bars. They usually oc-
cur on lite street when peoplc arc
in transit to other patties or bars.

Students involved in these conr
trontations are not legally con-
sidered victims. but com-
plainants The word victim ap-
plies to instances such as
burglary. rape, and assault where
something eithcr physical or
material is taken. according to
Associate Professor oi Sociology,
Christopher Hunter. in the case oi
street lights the distinction bet
ween victim and assailant is less
clear. according to Allen. Usually
it is lett to the courts to ascertain
who threw the tirst punch it one oi
the parties wishes to the suit. he
said Hunter remarked that the
complainant is simply dciined as
the individual who called the
police.

Since] students are the com-
plainants and incur injuries, they
become victims in a sociological
sense. Associate Professor oi

Conversely. those individuals who

Collegeage men are often least

sociologists have round that
retired people tend to be most

ed that college students
perpetuate this attitude. college
students order a pizza and have it
delivered rather than go into town
to eat it and occasional cross
