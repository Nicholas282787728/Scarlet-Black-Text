couraging them to be active
politically.

Socialism ls a reaction to the
abuses of capitalism. The chief
complaint is concentration of
economic power, Just as Hayek
decries those who want security
through government intervention.
socialists decry those who make
others depend too much on them
for economic \ielHJeing', and Willi
it, political. legal, and ClVll well
being.

Capitalists defend free enter
prise and the profit mechanism as
the most efficient way of organize
ing an economy. Such explanar
tions rarely go further than that.
Economies are set up to serve the
needs. and then the wants. of
society and its individuals. What
use is an economy that produces
the most at the least cost without
performing these functions? is the
marketplace more valuable than
the man?

The claim to efflCIency is also in
dispute. our economy 7 the
world! 7 is using up resources at
a fantastically high rate, one day
we will run short of such
materials and the shock could be
too much. Is this excessive cons
sumption efficient in the long run”
Free enterprisers tell people to
wait for the economy to pick up so
they can have a job. The lesson oi
the Great Depression was that
sometimes people can't get Jobs.
no matter how hard-working they
are, 15 if effluent to let these labor
resources go unused?

Sociologists talk sometimes oi
"relative deprivation", It means

oLnoo
CENTER

the way people feel about
themselves compared Wlth others
in a higher socioeconomic
stratum. The greater the dif-
ference. the more illrwnl they
bear to those above them. the
more irustration they feel. the
more easily the social fabric is
torn Income redistribution is one
way of narrownig the gaps, A
socialist sees it as not only a way
to eliminate undue privilege. but
part oi the cost oi maintaining
society.

A capitalist sees it as an unfair
cost to the more able in society

Any political solution to the pros
blem oi government intervention
will be somewhere in between
these two positions. which is good.
Neither oi our ideals can possibly
be reached, but if they were. the
abuses would be greatly pro.
nounced. The vast majority oi
people are not ideologues, they
are little concerned with what
doesn't directly aiiect thcm. Their
advantage lies in not getting too
caught up in speculation. But we
need to extend and realize
everyone's latent interest in what
lies beyond themselves.

The point is to be both more
compassionate and rational, and
that's the first step towards bring
ing the war of ideas to a
negotiated conclusion

Postscript: fan? You recently
said that you thought socialism
one oi the most reactionary
ideologies. i still haven't ligurcd
that out You said that this topic
was better left for another liliie. I
hope that time is coming soon,

Flag-tampering brings criticism

To the Editor:

We would like to voice our
displeasure about what was done
to the United States' flag on
Wednesday. November 7, due to
the outcome of the presidential
election. The flag vials lowered to
halfrmast and hung upside-down
by a few members of the cmapus
community What these few fail to
realize is that the nag symbolizes

5&8 likened to Nazi newspapers

To the Editor:

The recent assassination of In»
dlra Gandhi and the political
violence that followed it have sad-
dened me a great deal. At the
same time it made me thankful
that I live in a nation that does not
suffer that sort of violence. where
people settle their political dif»
ferences by compromise and
Without arms But then I was
reminded of how frightened l have
been by the editorial policy or the
s and is this semester, a policy
that I feel violates the American
traditions or compromise and oi
politics without violence.

Many of the editorials. and
many oi the news articla also.
reflect the extreme views of the
editor. Their tone has often been
self-righteous and intolerant,
leaving the impression that only
haters of humanity could disagree
with the author’s point of View.
Opinions about politics. sexism.
and homophobia. that most of us
find debatable. have been stated
as if they were undeniable facts.

If you have ever had the chance,
as I have had. to read Soviet books
or excerpts from Nazi
newspapers, you will iind very lit
tle difference between their lmr
passioncd and intolerant rhetoric
and the style or rhetoric in the s
and B; only the names oi the
causes have been changed. This
irightens me. Granted. the
writers for the S and B have no
real pouer, but I feel that this sort
of rhetoric v even that that calls
ior peace 7 ultimately leads to
one horrible result — political
violence.

The tragedy in india should re-
mind us at how lucky we are to be
living in a nation that does not see
this kind of violence. where men
aren't shol for their beliefs. and
where politicians agree to

disagree, It's alright to crllicize
our government and satiety 7
there certainly are a lot oi things
wrong with both 7 but let us be
thankiul ior what a great gift it
was for us to be born ill America
and to be able to spend iour years
in pursuit of knowledge without
governments or terrorists telling
us What we can and cannot think.
Let us avoid the kind of ms
tolerance that is becoming come
lnon at Gi‘lnliell This intolerance
is not only distasteful. but it is also
oi no help in reiorming thc world;
people don't take it seriously; it's
not at all convincing.

Most oi us are calling ior a more
tolerant and open society. one
where women. gays, blacks, and
others can gain iull acceplance,
But how can we expect people to
take our call for a more tolerant
society seriously when we dis lay
intolerance ourselves? If “e n't
get our own house in order. how
can we expect others to want us to
govern their lives?

Last night I watched the elec
lion returns with a Republican
and a Democrat. The Democrat
was the sort who covers himself
irom head to toe with buttons sup
porting one cause or another. As
we heard the news oi what may be
the death of the Democratic par-
ty, the Democrat ranted and rav-
ed about liovi horrible it was. how
it meant tlial vve would all be dead
four years irom now, The
Republican asked how he would
explain, ii the Republicans are so
evil. that [he American people
have chosen them to rule the nan
lion. All the Democrat did was
raise his voice. shout more
slogans. and call the American
people stupid

Congratulations on abortion coverage

To the Editor:

It's been heartening to sec that
both conservative and liberal
ideals have been presented in the
55415. In the past the 5&8 has
presented almost entirely liberal
positions and being at a liberal
campus like Grinnell. spurred no
controversy. Finally the smug
born-again elitist liberal attitude
is being reiined into thoughiui
liberal posxlions with mutual
understanding, The anti-abortion
argument was beautiiully done.
for example, and because of the

thought involved. the campus
liberals have carried out more
thoughtful discussions on doors
tion. Although. many liberals.
myseli included. disagree viith
some of the basic premises of the
argument. we have benefited
irom the letter in understanding
why others ieel the way they do on
that issues. l'd like to see more
thoughtiul arguments from both
sides on other issues as well.
With regard to the abortion
argument. my personal objections
to an antirabDrtiori law are two

To the Editor:

Congratulations on a wellr
considered. fair. timely discus»
sion by Ben Gessler of “Aborfio
a pro-life perspective,” a civil
rights issue of unsurpassed impor-
tance in our society. As Ben notes.
“There is much to worry about
the threat oi nuclear war. the pro»
blems in Central America. the

lack of help to the poor.” I for one
cannot (yet? i bring myself to vote
pro-lite. i believe. on the issue
or abortion over and against other
such life-and-death issues as those
mentioned, I claim abortion is an
unsurpassed but not unequalled

America \\i|l stay Ronald
Reagan's Amerio

We at Grinnell are a minority in
this nation. both as being left
leaning Democrats and as being
liberal arts students, Like the
Democratic party. we have leit
the nation, 1f \ve are to reform this
nation we viill have to go to it; it
“ill not come to us. That means
that we have to make an effort to
understahd why Americans have
voted for Ronald Reagan. When
we have done that. maybe we can
change Alnerica But line just go
on calling Americans stupid and
American society sick ,. as so
many oi us do 7 we are oi no use
to anybody; we are just babies
having a temper tantrum.

Well I've got a lot more to say ~
i haven‘t yet cited any specific
editorials in the S and B — but this
letter is already too long. Before I
finish let me say that I‘ve not been
upset with everything that I've
seen in the S and B 7 some of it
has been quite good 7 but the ins
tolerant and onersided attitude oi
the editorial policy has been
disgraceiul, it displays a sharp ms
tolerance and disdain for the
beliefs of our fellovi Americans; it
resembles childish name-calling
more than reasoned. constructive
criticism, As such it is a disgrace
