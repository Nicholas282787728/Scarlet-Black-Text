The Grinnell College campus
radio station K.D.I.C. is finally on
the air’, and many people involved
with the station are excited about
its success. “I’ve heard a lot of
positive feedback Lots of people
are listening,” commented station

DeYoung also expressed that he
was pleased with several renova-
tions which have transpired or are
planned.

The most drastic change cone
cerning K,D.l,C, is that it is now

Knew Too Much

by Kate Worster

The ninth film in Grinnell’s Hitchcock series is The Man Who Kiicvi
Too Much.

This Hitchcock movie was filmed twice, once in England and later in
the United States. The British version was filmed in 1936 and starred
Leslie Banks, Edna Best, and Peter Lorre. The American film, made in
1956, featured James Stewart. Doris Day. and Bernard Miles. The
American version will be shown here,

The plot revolves around a child who is kidnapped by a group that
plans to assassinate a political leader, The child‘s father is bribed by the
kidnappers not to reveal inlormation about their murderous plot,

While filming The Man \‘tho Knew Too Much, Hitchcock was also
working in television with his series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents”. The
American Version of The Man Who Klicu ‘I‘oo Much lost much of its
original quality because Hitchcock tried to dive deeper into the
psychologicial aspects oi the characters. The director ielt his viewers
received enough straight suspense troni his television program
However, the attempt to intensify the fllnls' characters failed and the
new version or the film is a poor remake of what was a good hitchcock
thriller.

The Man \ltio Kiicvt Too Much will be showing on \ieouesitay.
