Joint Board
extends debate on
letter challenging
U.S. policy in
Central America

by Ellen E. Brooke

After a heated two hour debate
an approval oi the letter concern-
ing Central America. the issue
was tabled for two weeks.
Because he had introduced the
resolution. Matt Golden was re
quired to temporarlly exchange
positions with Vice-president
Kosmidis to introduce the letter.

Before he could address the
issue. a “con" speaker was need-
ed. '

Paul McCready volunteered
with the words, “What the hell”.

Golden then began stating that
the impetus behind this letter was
the new U.S. policy oi deliberate
intimidation of Nicaragua to
destabilize the Sandinista govern
ment.

"This letter addresses the prin~
ciples by which our ioreign policy
should be guided. Military force
won't stabilize the country.
Stabilization can only occ
through self-determiniation."
Golden said.

Backing up his opinion. Golden
referred to an editorial in the
November lath issue of the Des

Committee
Life meets

by Klil‘la Erickson

The Committee on Student Life
met for the first time this year last
Thursday at a pm. though one file
nctlon of SGA. president Mott
Golden's job is to be the student
head of the committee this
semester .

“lt's partially my lault and par»
tially Tedermall‘s fault. We didn't
get the committee members pickr
ed." said Golden.

John Tedel'man. the Dean 01
student Allan-s. is the chairperson
ol the committee. According to
page 72 of the student Handbook.
“The Dean of Student Affairs
shall convene the first meeting of
the committee within the iirst two
weeks oi the semester " on page
73. it also said. “The chair shall be
responsible for setting the com-
mittee agenda and the time and
place of meetings."

Joint Board member Mike

Moines ltegister which argued
that U.S. military lorce is not in
the interest of our Central
American allies. It undermines
their peace process when they
don't get us. approval.

Golden believes that S.G.A. has
an "obligation to make political
statements.” Supporting this
statement Drive Masher said. "we
do have a mandate to pass
political resolutions."

McCready‘s “con" stance did
not address the politics of the let-
ter. but questioned S.G.A.'s rlght
to approve this letter. as such apr
proval might not represent the
majority opinion or Grinnell
students. He said that the majorir
Ly of his hall members were
against this letter. Therefore. he
was obliged to vote against it.

The floor then moved to Ben
Johnston. who claimed that the
issue was quite clear. He did not
see a need ior any in. members
to “practice the air oi
persuasion". and he moved to Call
the question.

His motion was not passed. and

the floor moved to Dave Masher
who yielded to Mike Cleary.
Cleary supported Golden and
Mosher by saying that “not taking
a stand isn't valid. We should
pressure U.S. forelgn policy in
any way we can.”

Regaining the iloor, Mosher ad»
dressed the political importance
of the letter. He stated that the
Sandlnislas are in power because
of the unpopularity oi Somoza. a
dictator the U.S. government put
in power in the 1930’s.

The Sandinistas are not the
radical communisB that the U.S
government believes them to be.
Mosher said. Moshel‘ feels that
diplomatic pressure should be en-
couraged rather than military

pressure because diplomacy can
lead to positive results.

lan McLean then gained the
iloor. He spoke against the letter
for a number of reasons. Before
deriding its polltical content he at
tacked its lorm. He found it to be
”intellectually shoddy". and it
neglected to deiine who or what
the Student Leadership Project is.
"Do we have guarantees that our
name won't be linked to issues
without our support?“ he asked.

Golden cleared this question
with the explanation that the
S.L.P. is a recently formed group

James party renamed
to avoid offense

James nail has changed the
name of its annual November ails
campus party again.

The party has long been the
center oi controversy since its
original conception as the James
Gang Bang. Tomorrow. the event
W|ll be known as the “Damn It
All."

The name ”Gang Bang" had
been decried as sexist. as an im-
pllcation of gang rape and deiend-
ed as an evocation of criminal {olk
heroes irom America's western
past.

'Uther names which have been

tried in years past are “bac
chanal" and "Free'For'All,"

troversy and we didn't want to
have a lot of controversy...and
want to start an enduring tradi-
tto‘n.”

This year's theme and name is
based on life in Hell. The theme is
hellish but definitely not meant to
be Satanic. Woods said.
