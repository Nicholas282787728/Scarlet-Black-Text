A note to the Trustees

,Just a note to the trustees of Grinnell College, on cam-
pus this weekend, and appearing in Loose Lounge at 5

pm. today:

The Divestment movement is large and widespread.
Divestment has been and is becoming increasingly ef—
fective as more and more institutions participate.

Over 40 colleges and universities have divested in ex-
cess of $150 million. Hundreds of city and municipal
governments and other public organizations have
divested several hundred million dollars. The Lutheran
Church alone has divested approximately $25 million.

Some divestment programs have been immediate and
some, as at Harvard and Yale, have been long-range or
gradual. Certainly a workable, profitable plan is not im-

possible and not costly.

Let’s see some serious thought given to the possibility
of joining this effective movement against apartheid this

weekend.

Bishop Tutu, honored recently with the Nobel Peace
Prize, has long been an outspoken voice for peace and

justice in South Africa,

Not coincidentally, Tutu has also long been in favor of

divestment.

‘Quoth the Raymond’

by Jeff Raymond

I think of voting much the same
way i drink of driving; too many
unqualiiied people commonly do
both,

It is a fact that a large percen-
tage ol the American electorate is
politically illiterate. Many or the
people oi voting age simply don’t
know what in the world is going on
when candidates seek office. Imc
competence is dangerous in driv»
ing and it isn‘t much better in the
voting booth.

Every four years, civic-minded
groups do their best to coax
everyone over 17 years oi age into
their local pooling places to per-
lorm their democratic duty.
Everyone from the major televir
sion networks to your local
League of Women's Voters
volunteer tries to whip up a
patriotic lervor.

my estimation is approximately
equal to PBS for quality programr

out-the-vote spirit. it seems they

by Ellen Weinswck

What is a conservative? Here is
the American Heritage Dic-
tionary‘s definition: CONSERr
VATIVE, adj., l) Tending to favor
the preservation or the existing
order and to regard proposals for
change with distrust... 4)
Moderate; prudent; cautious; “a
conservative estimate"; 5) Tradi-
tional in manner or style; not
showy, 6)Tending to conserve;
conserving; preservative.

Okay, so I'll admit it, I’m a coils
servative. Did i “favor the preset»
vation of the existing order. .”7
You bet. if the alternative was the
”reign or error” we've lived under
the past 4 years! The existing
order beiore the Reagan ad-
ministration was one in which our
country at least strivetl to better
the economic straits of all its
citizens; one in which Carter's
human rights initiative did not ex
cuse totalitarianism and genocide
merely because those who com»
mitted lhe atrocities weren't Com-
munist; one in which our gover
ment realized that arms negot'
tions are a serious and painstakr
ing process and worked with that
realization. It wasn't paradise,
we‘ll grant, but it was a lot easier
to listen to the evening news when
one wasn't worried about hearing
that the President had fallen
asleep in another Cabinet meeting
or that yet another at his aides had
been convicted or something or
that he was taking off on vacation
again. One didn't have to tee] em-
barassed by foreigners asking
whether our President had ever
heard or the word “diplomacy”.

“Tending to conserve" is okay
with me. too. After all, no one I
know personally has ever said “A
tree's a tree. How many more do
you have to look at?" Our incurrlr
bent President did, though,

uninformed, apathetic videots.

Bear in mind that the same we

ing to vote are largely the same

raise the drinking age to 21.

political incompetence is just as
dangerous at any age. But the

When all else tails. the Reagan
Administration has been
delighted to bring up the iact that
Walter Mondale has not actually
and formally disavowed the Rev.
Jesse Jackson who, in turn. has
been known to reler to New York
City as “Hymietown” and has not
disavowed the crazed anti»Semitic
Muslim Louis Farrakhan. It's
pretty nauseating. really. that an
incredible orator and ideaman
like Jackson had to do those
things. because quite a lew or us
“Hymies” were willing to sup
port him until he turned out not to
like us.

because they otten have no idea
how or why to vote.

Should voters, like drivers, be
forced to take some sort of test
and earn a “license" to vote? Of
course not. Elections are essen-
tially tree and open and should —
and will 7 remain that way.

But il’ only certain segments of
the population bother to exercise
their right to vote, so be it, Nobody
is going to urge bad drivers to get
behind the wheel of a car and
hamper the efforts at me more
able drivers. Likewise, it makes
no sense for people to urge the
uninterested, uniniormed voters
to case meaningless ballots. ,

People with a stake and an in-
terest in a race will make it to
their polling place without any
prodding. If someone who doesn't
care or doesn't know any better
doesn’t want to vote, let's not
make them think they should vote,
Let them stay home this Tuesday
night and watch Cyndi and Huey

wonderful ally we have in Israel.
perhaps he'd be disavowing the
Rev. Jerry Falwell, a man who
believes in making the U.S. a
"Christian" nation. Falwell's the
bestrdocumented. but not the only
religious crazy Reagan has refus-
ed to disavow, To quote such an
august source as the New York
Titties, ”The expressed belief of'a
number of television evangelicals
and other religious leaders who
are supporting Mr, Reagan is that
the present age is under the con-
trol ol satan. ,.believing Chris
trans, according to this view, will
be physically liltcd up lroin earth
in ‘the rapture' and reunited in the
air with Christ, who vtill return to
earth with an army oi saints to
punish unbelievers and destroy
the forces of Antichrist in the hair
lie of Armageddon.” (Oct. 24,
1984)

The reason why he doesn't
disavow them is because he
agrees with them Last December
6, Reagan stated in an iirticlc in
People magazine that “never. in
the time between the ancient proV
phesies up until now has there
been a time in which so many or
the prophesies are coming
together ”

What can we do about a man
like that who justifies his lax at-
titudes towards arms control by
stating that he is going to the rap
ture anyhow? This man appointed
James Watt. whose theory on why
it was okay to sell all our wildlife
sanctuaries to developers was
that the end of the world is so im-
minent that we needn’t worry
about savtng our planet.

And where is the voice of reason
in 19847 it seems to belong only to
New York Governor Mario
Cuomo, who stated so eloquently
iii a speech last month at Notre
Dame University, “I protect my
right to be catholic by protecting

your right ‘to be illvhatevei-Yiyou

start for the 1988 Presidency?
