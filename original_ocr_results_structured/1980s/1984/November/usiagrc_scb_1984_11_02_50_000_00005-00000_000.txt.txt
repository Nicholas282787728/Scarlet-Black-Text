Women’s Crou Country

Looking for a repeat performance

by Terri Porter

Ain’t nobody gonna break my stride;

Nobody gonna slow me down

Watch out . . . they‘re hot!
Ranked It] in the conference, the
Women's Cross Country team is
looking towards the conference
meet tomorrow with hopes oi
duplicating last year's iirst place
finish,

Can they do it lor the second
year in a row? Coach Evelyn
Freeman thinks it’s possible.
While not liking to make predic~
tions, she nevertheless is op-
timistic. “if we run as well as I'm
expecting," she remarked, "we
should win.”

Elaborating, she said, “We've
been working really hard all
season and have made steady im-
prcvements." Throughout the
season, Freeman particularly has
emphasized overcoming
variables such as hills, climate
conditions. etc.

After having concentrated
much of their efforts on this
apsect of training. the women are
a "little disappointed” that the
conlerence course is a relatively
mild one that presents no real
variables.

one might think they were a
litte crazy to want the extra
challenge posed by these
elements, but, as Freeman puts it.
“Since we trained so hard in over-
coming the variables and knew
how to handle them, we could feel
the advantage we’d have over the
other teams."

Soccer

Alter winning two ol the three
games they played in Colorado
over break. the Men’s Soccer
team is now ranked ninth in the
Midwest West Region (extenr
ding from Iowa to California), 80v
cording to Coach John Pfitsch.

The team beat Pomona-Pitzer
lCalifornia), 3-1, and Trinity
University (Texas), 3-1, to take
second place at the tournament.
Colorado College also defeated
these two teams, 371 and 7-1. but
since their point spread was

reater than Grinnell‘s, they
placed lirst in the tourney. orin7
nell faced Colorado College on
Monday, losing 3-0.

“I thought we played our best
soccer of the year,” stated
Pfiisch, who was “pleasantly sur7
prised" because oi the long trip,
the bad weather. and the fact that
they played on astroturl.

Following their success in Col-
orado, the men went to Knox on
Tuesday and defeated the
Siwashers, 2-0, for the Southern
Division championship. As a
result, the Pioneers will face Lake
Forest tomorrow for the con-
ference championship.

It’s not the first time the two
teams have met lor the champion
Ship, but, according tOPfitsch, the
Grinnell team is stronger than in
years past. “It should be a good
matchnp." he said. Game time is
at 1:00 on MacEachron Field.

Tennis

Ending their season with the
conference tournament at Lake
Forest. the Tennis Team placed
eighth out of 12 teams at cone
ference and ﬁnished the season
with an overall 577 record,

Hunter, the tournament was much
like the season in that it had its
”ups and downs ” The team did

top runners this year, and while
most oi them are back. Ellen
Mangan still won't be able to run,

tionable with a knee inyury. But.
as Freeman pointed out. “When at
a disadvantage, a team olten
knows they have to work even
harder."

whatever the case, the Grinnell
team should iinish right up at the
top A major advantage tor the
squad is that "they've got can»
iidencc 7 knowing they have the
ability to will" 7 especially based
on their superior periorniance
last year,

Another plus for the team is that
the women have iun together
How can such hard work be too?
They make it that way. “We have
a very good team atmosphere” of-
lerco Freeman, explaining,
"They're always pulling ior each
other, which creates a positive at
nlosphere ior them to work hard.“

Senior CocCaptain Andrea
straight believes this
togetherness is a big part oi the
team's success. "A lot ol people
don't think oi crossrcountry as a
team sport, but it is," she noted.

The cohesiveness is what makes
it more ofa team, and, as straight
points out, the unity ironically

stems ironi each athlete knowing ,

that she can only look to herseli
ior either a strong or weak psrior7
mancc 7 she can “only blame
herself," as Straight puts it.

The lormula is obviously a suc~
cessful one, as proven once again
last weekend when Grinnell plac-

Freeman looks for the strength
to continue through conference. In
discussing individual pcrior7

“Shavaun has improved tremen
dously this year," adding. “She’s
pretty close to being in contention
for Nationals if she runs as well as
we hope."

Freeman also pointed to its run
ner lngrid Hutter. who began run

competitive experience. Straight,
when she was able to run, “has
always be been a strong runner."

Friday and Saturday, Grinnell
finished with a 1274 tourney record
—- defeating Knox. 15-8, 15-9 —
thus placing Grinnell iilth out oi
six conference teams at the tour-
nament,

”Overall. l'm really quite pleas-
ed with the improvement 7
especially with the improvement
in attitude and hustle. commented
Coach Del) McCarty. “We out-
hustled most of the teams we
played," she remarked, adding,
”I'm a little disappointed that
there were several games we
should have won but let slip away
due to a lack of ‘killer instinct' »
we’re not used to winning,"

McCarty noted the two setters,
Elaine Schwartz and Kristen
031195, for their strong play
throughout the season “One ol
the reasons we played well was
because we had two setters who
could handle the 6-2 offense. " she
said,

McCarty also pointed to Laura
Maly and Liane Kimura for “calm

ing on really strong towards the‘

end oi the season."

due to being abroad. Finally.
Freeman noted Freshman Susie
Raney. who “had a slow start, but
in the last week or two has come
one really strong to make it into
the top seven runners ”

The amount oi talent on the
team is obvious and the nice thi7
ng is that the team is so young.
Straight and Durkee will graduate
this year and will be “missed
tremendously," according to
Freeman

But she is looking for another
good season next year when

pie missing the game, injuries,
fall break, and the fact that Mon-
mouth played pretty good football
7 they were tougher than we
thought they were.”

Continuing, he said, “The stats
speak ior themselves and in-
dicated that Grinnell wasn’t ready
to play ball."

The Pioneers lace lllinois Coir

of the season. Martinek believes
the matchrup should be a fairly

same record as Grinnell.

in closing. he noted, “Most ball
games are won ironi the neck up
[mentally], so I hope the team is
mentally prepared on Saturday."

Field Hockey

Cluding that of the Field Hockey

scheduled over break were
cancelled thanks to the wet stuff,
and the games they did play were
on fields in “muddy, terrible con-
dition," according to Coach Dee
Fail-child.

playing conditions, Fairchild tell
that the two weeks the team had
off after Carlton affected its game
in terms of “playing together.”
“They went back to their old style
of defensive field hockey." noted
Falrchild, “wheras all season
we’ve been playing on the olien7

expects nluch improvement from
many of those who went out for
their first time and now “have a
year of experience behind them."
And, iinally, as Freeman puts it,

Fairchild, is “looking forward to a
real good season next year.“ The
loss of Seniors Kathy Cullen and
Val Mauck will be felt, but the
team is a young one and Fairchild
has "heard troni a lot oi new pro-
spects.”

Men’s
Cross Country

Despite a difficult English-style
course and a gusty headwind, the
Men's Cross Country team mang~
ed to pull out their first win of the
season.

“The times were a bit slow, but
we expected that," noted Coach
Will Freeman. He explained,
“The course was very tough, and
probably the biggest obstacle was
the very strong wind, which made
it extremely hard to run.”

The race was run in flights,
where all the number one runners
from each school run in the first
flight, all number two runners
race in the second flight, and so
on. Grinnell took first place in five
of the seven flights.

Dave wisdom (flight it placed se-
cond with 30:11.

‘The men are tapering their
workout this week in prepartion
for their ultimatle goal — con-
ference. Freeman is optimistic.
“We should be able to run with
just about anyone," he com.
mented, adding, “Out of all the
conference teams. 1 think we
should place in the top live or so."

As Freeman put it “The work is
done. The key is to make sure they
sta healthy."
