protest

To the Editor.

in regard to James Kissaiie‘s
stance on the Afro-American
Literature position expressed in
the Jan, 27 issue of the 58:8 and
his February 11 memo to the
taculty. we, members oi the black
community, contend that his
stance humiliates Professor Ken~
neth Chambers and disregards
the needs of the black community

Kissane states in the memo that
”. . . the issue is not a matter of
,the English department's can-

' didate, We [the English Dept]
have never had such a wish; ours
is a wish to make the best appoint
merit we can. . ”, Yet Klssane
never once refers to Kenneth
Chambers as haVlng been a can
didate, having applied ior the
position or even having iilled the
position ior the pastsemester. he.
in fact. never makes reference to
Chambers at all. We find that this
humiliates Chambers for it under-
mines his credibility as a can-
didate.

Kissane also states in the
memo, ”Without in the least denyr
ing that the college needs more
minority members, one may sure-
ly question whether even that
need is necessarily greater than a
need to advertise positions honest
ly and to mislead no applicants
knowingly,” Were he to question
the needs and concerns of the
Grinnell College Black Communi-
ty, Kissane would possibly not
undermine the importance of the
need to have black professors as

role models, the need to have,

“diversity“ among the tacult‘y
members (there is currently one
black tenured professor) and the
need to be aware of decisions vital
to the Black Community. An ex
change is needed before informed
and just consideradtion can be
given to the situation.

We are confident that the assers
[ions of Mr. Kissane are not
shared by most oi the iaeulty and
administration. We therefore den
mand the respect for both Pro-
fessor Kennedi Chambers and for
the concerns of the Grinnell Col
lege black community. — Karen

political
activity‘

To the Editor,

Ihope it is not too late to com-
ment upon the last semester at
Grinnell, as presented in the
pages of the sets.

It was encouraging to see at
least the beginnings of a new in:
terest in political activity on came
pus. Given the particular con-
cerns here in Germany it wa.
gratiiying to read or Grinnell par
ticipating in a demonstration at
the air base near Omaha. Even
more noteworthy was the perfor-
mance of David Kopelman
Although I do not entirely share
his political perspective l com»
mend him for forcing Grinnellians
to remember that beyond their
small, involving environment lies
a world of which we are all, like it
or not, a part. Two years of the
“Grinnell experience” though,
lead me to be pessimistic and to
suspect that the tendency towards
apathy and “liberal“ talk without

action prevails. 1 hope I am

Two brash
women

To the Editor:

After four years of reading the
Scarlet Kt Black’s liberal pres
paganda, we ielt it time to make it
known that there are still some
traditional women with American
values: Women who think nothing
oi shaving their legs, waxing off
body hair, wearing brassieres,
blow drying their hair and using
cosmetics. and who still believe
that men find this very attractive.

The killing
game

To the Editor:

— Quite recently, anew sport was
adopted and organized at Grin-
nell, In it, students used toy dart
guns and attempted to ambush
one another. If the ambush was
successful, a “kill"was registered
tor that participant, who advanc-
ed in the game until only a single
champion was left “alive”, The
new game was supposedly non-
violent, and a benign way to vent
one’s frustrations after a hard day
of studying. 1, (or one, conclude
diiierently, and am concerned
and upset about the game's im-
plications for the attitude of
members of the Grinnell student
body concerning human life.

For one thing, 1am perplexed at
the contradiction between the
game and many oi Grinnell's so—
called “Values". I have the tragi-
comic image of dozens of young
sensitives who, by day prate and
preach about the horrors of
nuclear conflagration or the
atrocities of Latin American
death squads, donning by night
their black leotards and ski masks
to prowl our campus with plastic
guns, leaping out from behind
bushes to put imaginary bulleb
through the brains of fellow
students. It is ironic that in an in-
stitution where so many words
about “human rights” and the
“sanctity of all human life" are
incessantly rattled about. mat this
activity took place, practiced in
part by those very people who do
much of the rattling. What is the
term, “pseudo liberal”?

Perhaps the most outrageous
aspect of this game is that it was
not a game, but a sport played for
money. Apparently each contes—
tant paid an entry fee, proceeds
irom which went to a cash prize to
the winner (or should I say “best
assassin"7) - as well as a very
lucrative commission for the
game‘s organizer, who might do
well to study the above paragraph
again.

It will be said in the game’s
defense that it was harmless, a
fantasy pursued ior relaxation,
without-any clear thought of real

One student’s
explanation

To the Editor,

The issue of a salary cut for
Georgia Dentel has once again
surfaced and unfortunately, it has
suriaced as an unsupported at-
tack on the administration. Before
it goes any further, I would like to
present what facts I know.

First, I would like to describe

, what Ms. Dentelrdoes. She/is the

Performing Programs and' Ac
tivities Counselor. As I unders-
tand it, she calls movie companies
and orders iilms, negotiates and
arranges band contracts for coins
certs and dances, schedules
movies (when, where), and works
with the Public Events Committee
arranging activities such as last
week’s theatre production. She
does an excellent job; anyone
looking at any week's entertain-
ment schedule would certainly
agree.

, I-Iei- position, as contracted, also
includes the responsibility for a
considerable amount of followup
(meeting the bands when they ar»
rive, making sure the correct
movies arrive on campus and get
where they need to be, supervis-
ing events, etc.i and spending ten
hours every week on campus.
However, she does not spend any
time on campushin her office in
the Forum or elsewhere.

These duties have been picked
up, quite willingly. by Various
students and absorbed by some oi
the student positions. The Film
Frojectionists and Concerts Chair
have taken over some of them. As
a Forum Desk Attendant, I have
met a few bands when they arrive
and it is a part of my job I enjoy.
The students seem to welcome the
added responsibility and oppor
tunities, Thereiore, over the years
it has been realized that students
can handle many of the respons
sibilities that appear in Ms.
Dentel's contract.

As a result of this, a new con
tract has been formulated. The
new contract, as I understand it,
covers only what she does (the
phone work) and cuts out the time
she has been paid for which has
been absorbed by students. The
issue is not, as it has become in
some instances, a question oi iir-
ing Ms. Dental or hiring someone
to slowly move into her position. it
is a straightforward salary cut
based on contractual obligations.

decisions in an educated, mature
way. Before attacking, let’s get
the issue and fact straight. It is
our responsibility to inquire as to
the facts before making a deci-
sion, It is the responsibility of the
administration to supply the iacts
we need to properly evaluate any
student concern. I ask anyone who
is not sure that Ms. Dentel is being
treated fairly based on the fact-S
that I have presented to consider
this: it is time to let Ms. Dentel
negotiate ior herself.

~ Susan Sink

Dentel tells
her position

To the Editor:

Susan Sink has never talked
with me about ﬂ'ie Social/Cultural
program, the duties of my job or
my contract with the college,
although it was suggested that she
do so. In fact. I welcome inquiries
from any student either about this
matter or social programming, in
general, at any time. She says in
her letter, “Let’s get the facts
straight. It is our responsibility to
inquire as to the facts.” The dif-
liculty with her letter appears to
be that it makes interpretation of
the concept of supervising a social
program without beneiit oi
background knowledge and
therefore makes assumptions
which do not represent
agreements based on the job
descriptions.

The given description of my job
is simplistic. There is not mention
at all of my creative function. I
refer readers to the Feb. 3 Scarlet
and Black lead story for a more
accurate description, My job is of
a special nature, It requires four
hours a day of contract with book
ing sources and availability to my
telephone throughout the day and
evening hours up to 12 to i am
Those who wish to check on how I
do my job should talk to the Social
Chairpersons and faculty to whom
I furnish services. These people
have supported me and my work
ing relationship with them over
the years and say that they have
not absorbed my duties. 1 work
with them now in the same ways
that I always have. I was hired by
the college to design, develop and
maintain a Social/Cultural ac
tivities program. This is exactly
what I do.

Perhaps the iollowing state
ment will clarify the present
situation. My discussions with the
administration have revolved
around only a few issues, First,
the reason stated by the college to
me for reduction of the position
are purely iinancial on the part oi
the college. I have this in’wriliii'gf ’
Reductions in other positions have

been linked to this one.

Secondly, the job has not been
reduced to the booking function as
the thrust of the Sink letter in
dicates In fact, my problem in the
negotiations has not been one of
detending against functions being
removed, but rather of asking,
with only limited result, that func-
tions he removed in proportion to
alteration in salary.

The third problem has been one
oi honest disagreement on
Whether or not reduction of the
position will aiiect the quality oi
programming. There is no argu-
ment about whether or not a pro-
gram can be presented. The ques
tion is on what level oi quality base
ed on what amount of money Grin—
nell has to spent on programming.
The budget was reduced cons
siderably oils year. A look at the
three Public Events Programs be»
ing presented this semester
(Black Light Theatre, Master
Harold and the Vienna Philhar-
monic Octet) will give an idea of
the level of quality to which I
reier. Grinnell’s popular concerts
program has been written about
three times by Billboard
magazine in the last several years
and has been compared in quality
with programs at larger schools,
including the University of
Michigan and the University of
California at Berkley. Many are
tists have written privately about
the quality of our prey-am as
well.

The difference between the
level of programming that can be
expected on Grinnell’s budget and
the level delivered is a result of
negotiating skill and personal
relationships which the activities
counselor develops and maintains
with hookers, artists and artists“
managers.

Because the booking business is
fastvmoving, the contracts must
be continually maintained and
developed. Some of the events
must be negotiated over several
years to reduce them, finally, to
an affordable level. The question
is can the same level of progamms
ing attained in the full-time posi»
tion be attained in the half-time
position. Given the time»
comsuming nature oi the book-
ing/negotiating process and the
timecomsuming nature oi work
ing through the student commit-
tee structure, upon which the
counselor cannot force eiiiciency,
I am not sure that the same level
of programming can be promised
an reduced time. I have, oi course,
attempted to advise against
reduction attention given to a pro-
gram which I consider to be an
important part of student lite.
However, 1 will do my best to
develop a satisiactory program

' within the context‘of the hahrth-ne
,i position, — Georgia Dentel
