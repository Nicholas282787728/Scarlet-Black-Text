Moffett Elected Faculty Chair Grinnell Hosts
ACM Feminist
Conference

by Andrew Hamilton

Alexander "Sandy“ Moiiett, pro»
iessor of theatre, was elected to the
position or laculty chair on March
11. Moiiett, whom the iaculty
selected irom a field at about 10
nominees, will hold the office [or
the herbs and obese school years.
Don Smith is the current faculty
chair.

Moiiett sees the curriculum as
the main locus ior the faculty in
the coming years, particularly
because oi the college's implemen-
tation oi the 3-2 program next
semester. The adjustment to 3'2.
involving consolidation ol courses
and addition of faculty. will merit
much attention. he said. Motfett is
hoping to achieve a “rational over-
View" oi these changes in order to
avoid the problems which might
arise if each department were to
make adjustments without cans
sideration oi the other depart
ments.

Havmg nu coreecurriculum pra~
posal on which to remark
specifically, Moitett said that he is
in iavor of limited Cores and that
he would like to see a "curricular
direction" that suits Grinnell's
needs. He cited the Jack ’01 pro»
gress in the development or the
curriculum over the past decade.

iett l'rowns at the evident antipathy
the student body has developed
towards the faculty in the core
Curriculum debate. HE would like
the students and iaculty to work
together in order to implement
“structure" and “guidance” in the
Curriculum. This would [nous

community more productive tor
students and iaculty, said Moilett.

The general trend oi the faculty
is towards iurther curriculum
debate, Moiiett said. He com-

mented that the “continual evolu- ‘

lion" of the curriculum has slowed
since 1971). when requirements
were abolished at Grinnell, and ad-
ded that now the discussion over
the curriculum is beginning to pick
up again. There is “a kind oi
restlessness [in the faculty] over
this [the core~curriculum
debatel," he said. Moliett favors
this trend, "Curriculum debate is
an ongoing thing. . . .Part 01' the job
at the faculty is to debate the cur
riculum."

In general, Moiiett points out
that the Chair of iaCulty "does not
have the power to make things

will be purely administrative, such

comments that it is particularly
diliicult to gauge the number oi
students who use the college's

“there are so many diiierent sers
