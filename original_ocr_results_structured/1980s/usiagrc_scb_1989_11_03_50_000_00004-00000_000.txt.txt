Alvin Ailey Gives Strong Show,
But Lacks Group Precision

 

By Mariah Geode

The Alvin Ailey Repertory Eu-
semble, dancing to a full house in
Roberts Theater last Friday, dis
played amazing strength, ﬂexibility
and technical ability in a production
with many interesting and innova-
tive sequences, including creative
uses of the ﬂoor and partnerwork,
But thechoreography throughout the
productions could have been more
innovative.

And though the solo work in all
three productions was quite good,
the precision ofall unison dance in-
volving two or more dancers was
often lacking.

The first production. “Streams,“
included one section called “Aria,“ a
dance choreographed as a canon
using pairs of dancers. Refreshingly
enough, the ensemble used pairs of

men and pairs of women rather than
traditional heterosexual dance pair-
ings. This section was also enjoy-
able,aseveryone was doing thesarnc
things at different times. This dance
did not suffer from lack of precision
in unison work.

In the second piece, "I See the
Moon... and the Moon Sees Me,"
the solo work in “Crescent Moon"
was excellent. But precision was
once again a problem for the larger
dances.

“Half Moon Gypsies“ was dis-
turbing in its portrayal of the female

gypsy as being passively dragged
around by the male gypsies, tltough
when she did dance it was some of
the more innovative choreography
of the evening. The “Full Moon"
segment’s dominance struggles
ended predictably with males con»
trolling the situation, a troubling
aspect for some viewers.

The third and final production,
“lSBA,” was the most classical of
the three productions in terms of
choreographic style, music and aes»
thetic appeal. Solo work was good,
and partnerwork was good but very
traditional in its choreography and
pairings.

Despite these criticisms, watchr
ing the Alvin Ailey Repertory En-
semble was enjoyable. If nothing
else, the audience had a wonderful
chance to see some very strong. tale

Baby Jane: Jealousy On and Off—Screen

By Jennifer Mattes

Robert Aldrich’s 1962 film What-
ever Happened Ia Baby Jane? is part
of a retrospective tribute at Grinnell
this week to the work of the late
Bette Davis. Hercostar in the film is

Joan Crawford, and they play two
sisters trapped together in retirement
within a stuccoed, Spanish»style
California mansion.

Crawford is Blanche, a one-time
Hollywood star whose career ended
in the wake of a mysterious and
demobilizing car accident.

Tragically confined to a wheel-
chair, she is reluctantly taken careof
by her sister lane, played by Davis.
A severe animosity exists between
the two, at first more apparent on
lane‘s part.

This state ofaffairs is set up by the
film‘s opening ﬂashback, in which a
young Blanche seethes at the child
star type of popularity garnered by
her sister.

But somewhere along the line a
reversal occurs. Blanche outstrips
Jane later with a more viable, adult
acting career dependent on her own
merits. unlike Jane’s cute grand-

standing as a child. Add to this
Blanche's untimely car accident,
seemingly precipitated by Jane, and
a scenario of repressed hatred and
jealousy unfolds.

Their house becomes increasingly
claustrophobic, aplaccin which two
warped personalities collide to per-
verse effect. Jane mercilessly tor-
tures her sister in various ways. At
one point she even forcibly imprise
ons Blanche in her own room. And
she tries toreviveherown lostchild-
hood fameby hiringEdwin Starr, an
unemployed pianist dominated by
his overbearing mother.

The film is complex and layered.
The scene in which Starr and Jane
rehearse for her comeback is full of
pathos and gruesome humor, as two
severe examples of arrested devel-
opment ﬂail at unrealistic dreams of
fame.

The entire ﬁlm, in fact, renders the
dark underbelly of stardom. lt func
tions as a searing indictment of a
Hollywood system that creates such
pathetic human results and spits them
out amidst the beaches and palm
trees of California to wither away in
delusion and perversity.

Aldrich shot his film in a stark,

hard-edged black and white. He
thereby deﬂates the typical colorful
iconography one would associate
with a glamorous Hollywood.

He also uses it to set Davis' ex-
pressions in sharp relief, so that her
face becomes a crinkled, powdered
mask of woe. Aldrich in fact cred-
ited Davis with creating her own
hideous aspect with makeup, which

attests to her own theatrical back-
ground.

“I wanted to look outrageous, like
Mary Pickford in decay," she later
said.

And Davis’ rivalry with Joan
Crawford on the set of the ﬁlm was
notorious. Thepsychological horror
of their on-screen relationship was
facilitatedbyaconcurrentoff—screen
friction between the two actresses.
Davis accused Crawford of regu-
larly consuming large amounts of
vodka-spiked Pepsi on the set, while
Crawford bitterly campaigned in
New York against Davis’ Oscar
nomination.

So when Jane tells her sister “By
the way,-Blanche, we got rats in the
cellar," the viewer delights in the
ironic real-life basis of the fictional
malice.

Despite the fact that she lost the
Oscar that year to Anne Bancroft,
Bette Davis’ work in WhateverHap-
pened la BabyJarte represents Davis
at the peak of her acting career.

 

The Either/Orchestra ensemble .

The Either/Orchestra to
Jazz Up South Lounge

By Andrew Hamilton

“Based in Cambridge, Massachu»
setts, the Either/Orchestra is an 11-

piece group that roars like a big

band, employs electronics to dis
creet but telling advantage and tem-
pers a respect for the jazz tradition
with just the right amount of ﬂip
pancy.”

What Frances Davis of the Phila-
delphia Inquirer is talking about in
this quote is the Either/Orchestra,
the adventurous and spirited post-
modernist blues fusion group which
will jazz up South Lounge Thurs-
day.

The group has been heralded by
critics and audiences as a fresh and
daringvoiceonthejazz-blues scene.
They bridge the gaps between con»
temporarypop,rock, funk, freevfon‘n,
jazz and blues to produce a sound
true to the ja and blues traditions,
yet new and inspired in its own right.

Founded in 1935 as a composers'
and arrangers‘ workshop, the band
is comprised of two trumpets, two
trombones, three saxophones, gui»
tar, bass, keyboards and drums. To

cveryone’s surprise, this large en-
semble grew into a successful per»
forming unit with the ability to
combine big band power with the
freedom of a small combo.

Members of the Either/Orchestra
have played or recorded with such
artists as Throwing Muses, Cab
Calloway,JohnCougarMellencamp
and the Four Tops. Their inﬂuences
stem mainly from Ellington, Min-
gus, Sun Ra, Monk and Trane.

But the members encompass styles
derived from sources in rock, funk,
electronic jazz, European classical,
mariachi, Haitian. salsa and meren-
gue idioms.

Although the band is steeped in
the jazz tradition and is able to play
the masters with care and success,
the ensembleisprimarilyfuture-orL
ented. Spontaneity and personal
expression are their key goals.

And the critics seem to think that
theFJOis achievingwhatit set outto
do. As Brad Stone of Reﬂex magar
zine says, “Revolutionaryjazz play~
ers from a revolutionary town —
Boston. Be adventurous and take a
chance. Very hip."
