The 11th annual Grinnell Relays will
usher in its second decade of decadence on
April 29, Generally considered a spool on
the Drake Relays, the two events usually
occur on the same day.

A $1937 budget, Submitted to SGA this
week, provides for such items as $125
worth of kazoos, $75 worth oi bagels and
1000 balloons for $58.

Funds ior roughly 40 kegs of beer,
amounting to about $1000 will come from
sales or Relays paraphernalia. Hats and
T-shirts bearing a Grinnell Relays logo
will be available for sale next week {or $2
and $5, respectively,

The logo was designed by Narrah Kan»
sas and is "absolutely beautiiul this year,"
according to Bill McCullough, one or tour
Relays chairpersons.

A rough schedule or Relays events is now
available. The events will begin on Friday
night with the Shakln’ Pyramids.

Following the band will be “Titular
Head,” the traditional showcase for stu
dent "talent.” As the name connotes, any
prizes awarded in the contest will be
nominal

This year’s show promises to be better

regulated than past attempts, The com-
mittee, according to McCullough, is placV
ing "a lot oi emphasis on making iitular
Head a better act "

i, The midnight movie will be Animal

House. Student security is prepared to
discourage any excessive enthusiasm
which the film may inspire.

Saturday's festivities will_begin around
10 p m. with the “Bloody Mary-Bagel
Breakfast,” The location has not been set.
but the menu will be as the name states.
The breakfast will be catered by
Chandelbaum's and is not associated with
Food Service.

At 12 a. in. students may follow the
parade around a prescribed parade route.
Dorms may enter iloats in the parade
which ends up in Darby parking lot

The actual Relays open at 1 p m. The
Relays consist or games generally involw
ing beer Games will include the tradl'
tional Babe Ruth Bat Race and a chugging
contest, all “fairly innocuous," according
to McCullough.

Any student may participate in the ac-
tivities, teams will be organized informal-
ly on the spot.

A picnic, provided by Food Service. has
traditionally followed the Relays, which
last until about 4:30 p.m. Food Service
Director Dave McConnell, however, ob-
jects to holding a picnic this year on the
grounds that it becomes difficult to screen
out those not on board.

McCullough predicts that about 70 per-
cent oi the campus will attend at least one
of the Relays events. In addition, the
Relays can be considered Grinnell's
homecoming, for many alumni return for
the weekend.

The committee wishes to encourage
iaculty to attend, considering the Relays a
good opportunity ior faculty and students
to interact on an informal basis. Mc-
Cullough admits, however, that faculty
members may have been trightened away
in the past by beer throwing.

A particularly oiiensive feature oi the
iormer Relays, the “mud pit,” is no longer
on the agenda, and McCullough feels
assured that it is possible for students to
observe the Relays without danger or
harassment. The Relays committee would
like to convey an image or good, clean ion.

Philosopher Searle stresses liberal arts at ceremony

by Eric Weiss

John to Searie, prolessor oi philosophy
at the University or California, Berkeley,
outlined the skills one should develop in
pursuing an undergraduate education durr
ing his speech at the Phi Beta Kappa ans
nounceinent ceremony last Wednesday.

Searle began by stressing the impor»
tance or English. "If you know how to
write English, you don't have as much
trouble reading lt,‘Y he said

He also noted the importance oi learning
a ioreign language, “One or the silly
mistakes we made in the 605, an era we're
becoming embarrassed about, is that we
abandoned the ioreign language. You just
can't understand your own language
unless you have another one to compare it
with. I didn't know what the subjunctive
was until i took a foreign language," ex-
plained Searle.

On the subject of history, Searle noticed
the diminishing importance names and

dates have taken in the discipline. "A lot of
the people I've met who have just studied
cultural and intellectual history don‘t
know any cultural and intellectual history
because they don t know when any of these
events have happened >

Seaile then emphashed the importance
oi learning a science and knowing at least
one discipline la major) in the
undergraduate years

On Monday Seai‘le gave a lecture entitl-
ed "Mind. Brains, and Computers " Searle
said that computers cannot have mental
states, "because they have syntax but no
semantics. Mental processes, Searle
argued, are a property only or animal lite.
On Tuesday Searle participated in a panel
discussion.

plained. "When the competition is tight we
consider othei iactors such as diversity in
your courses

when asked what is typical GPA oia Phi
Beta Kappa member, Babenei responded,
“The average GPAs differ radically from
year to year.”

such figures should never be considered
“acceptable."

Fiedler also mentioned a bevy of logistic
flaws with CRP. Some examples from the
report include:

'A plan in Columbus, Ohio, in which the
last digit of people's Zip Code determines
in which diiection they evacuate A
survey, however, showed that less than
half the citizens of Columbus know their
Zip Code.

‘Bethel, Vermont, with a population or
soil, is a designated ‘host' area expected to
provide for over 15,000 visitors in the event
of war, One of the buildings designated a
fallout shelter in Bethe] is a greenhouse.

'The plans call ior people to be away
from home [or two weeks and then return
home. Radiations levels on Bikini atoll
were unacceptable for human habitation
23 years alter a test bomb had been
detonated there.

'The Selective Service believes it can
enlist 100,000 able bodied people within two
weeks oi a nuclear exchange. And the In
ternal Revenue Service has plans for a
Post Nuclear Recovery Tax,

Fiedler termed these plans “a big lie"
because they engender the beliei that
nuclear war is survivable. He stresses the
need ior preventive measures such as a
hiicl‘earvfreeze as survival of such a war is
