Administration seeks
activities position cutback

by Jeff Rlymond

Performing Programs and he
tivities Counselor Georgia Dentel has
one week from today in order to decide
whether to swept a new contract
which would require her to continue
her present job on a part~time basis for
half of her present pay. or leave the
school.

After given an order by Couege
President George Drake to reduce Stu
dent Affairs personnel hours, Dean of
Student Affairs James Tederman
decided that one position to be cut
back was Dentel's. Explained Teder-
msn. “I thought it (Daniel's position)
was a halHime job,"

Dental, who has been at the college
since 1960, met with Drake and Tedcr
man last Wednesday to discuss the ads
miriistrstion's contract otfer. she told
the 5&3 that she was not aware that a
final date had been set and noted that
she teit that there were still items to
be discussed

Responding to Tedcrman's assertion
that hers was a halftime job. Denml
gave the son the following statement

“I have been at the College 23 years
and have worked with ten former
deans and two former presidents who
huve considered what I do to be a full

time job. The program is larger now
than it has ever been, I think that Mr.
Tederman is not seeing these matters
in their full perspective. but 1 don't
think the 5&3 is the proper forum in
which to discuss the situation at this
time and so 1 will not comment fur
ther."

Despite the controversy at cutting
Dentel's salary, Tederinan reniaire
firm in the offer of half pay, "rve been
told to take so many positions out of
Student Services and as long as that
holds, I'm going to remain firm in my
stance." he said. Tedei-inan also in
stated that he did not feel that the
part-time aspect of the job would hurt
the activities program.

Tcderrnan said that the job descrip
tion of Dentel's position included only
booking performing artists and films.
Dentel said that while this description
was technically correct, she was in
volved with six area SGA concerts;
SGA films; special interest programs
such as the Waltz, Relays and Senior
Week; Academic enrichment items;
Public Events Series events like the
Black Light Theater and other special
performers; and her own contribu»
tions to balance and variety in ac
tivities,

Tederrnan stud that he was in»
strucmd by Drake last year to reduce

staff under his jurisdiction because of
declining enrollment at the school.
“Looking over our entire Student At.
fairs staff." explained Tederiaan, "I
made several decisions and Georgia
was one of them."

Other cutbacks include ending three
months of employment for the oasis
tant director of Career Services and
two months for the secretary to the in-
ternational students' advisori Both of
those jobs had been 12-month posi-
tions. Another position was
eliminated last year when Donna
Bailey was promoted to director of the
Health Center and the nurse's job she
left was dropped.

Tedcrman said that he has no plans
to reduce the staff in his own office.

“I have no inwntion whatsoever of
hurting our Student Activities pro
gram.” Tederman said, “We have a
very good one and we need it" He said
that many other schools have part
time activities directors,

Several students from SGA were
notified by Drake and Tedermnn at
the end of last semester that Dental
would be offered a reduced contract.

Kennan probes U.S. -Soviet difficulties

by Eric Green

In a Scarlet and muck interview on
Monday, George Kennan, who was in
town to deliver the 50th annual
Rosenficld Lecture, discussed a wide
range of topics, including nuclear
weapons and US-Soviet relations.

Kennan identified two major pro
blems in these relations. First, ”the
great differences in tradition.
psychology. expectations, history,
geography. and interests of the two
countries," And secondly, “the
weapons race which has started up. i .
since the Second World War.“

Later, Kennan pointed out that the
Russians are not bent on achieving
World dominntion by military means.
“I have never seen any evidence for
this. The Russians may want other
things but they do not want another
Zreht war."

He also stated that deterrence is not
necessarily the reason that war has
not broken out between the US and
the Sovlet Union, in fact, he said that
even if nuclear deterrence were
responsible for the absence of war. it
would be necessary to find a different
deterrent, because nclear Weapons are
too dangerous.

Reduction cruis..5evici1"enaionr

Kennan discussed 2 number of ways
to reduce the tensions between are
US, und the Soviets. “I would , . . like
to see a great diminution of the
military tension and an the practices
of both governmenls that surround
thc’, tension, a great diminution of the
swing and the shadowing: of each
other, acting as though we were at
war with each other." lle also new
that or greater amount of negotiations
on broader langc oi topics as weil as

s. would help rcducct

Kennan obyects to a number of tac-
tics employed by the Reagan ad-
ministration regarding the Soviets, He
sees no reason to use trade as a
weapon against Russia. In addition. he
noted that the "Russians are very sen-
sitive people, and one should bear that
in mind. They need to have a certain
outward respect shown for them by
other people otherwise they react very
badly."

Kennan believes that Reagan’s
rhetoric, in which the President label-
ed Russia the “focus of evil," is a
mistake because the Soviets are more
sensitive shout appearances than most
other countriesr

Kennan said, “I think Mr. Reagan
made a mistake in that he thought
that the things he said about them
would not affect them, that they knew
they were so bad, and that therefore
they would just think that he had
found them out."

Improved bilateral relations With
the Soviets could be useful in other
areas of foreign policy. according to
Kennan The United Nations is one
such area, He noted that continued
participation in the US would be
easier if the divisive bipolarity caused
by US»Soviet competition was
eliminated,

When asked how he felt about the
resurgence of patriotism in this coun-
try, Kennan said, “lfpatriotism means
‘love of country,’ which takes account
of the faults of our country
the good features of it
nothing against it dot if patriotism
takes on the character of
chauvintsm and So

Kennan is not optimistic about the
future of Reagan’s foreign policy. He
expressed disappointment that the
President had not responded
favorably to the Nuclear Freeze move
ment despite the public’s support of
arms control.

He suggested that the Freeze move
ment expand its agenda to include pro-
posnls such as the Comprehensive Test
Ban treaty and a renunciation of the
militarization of outer space, The
freeze alone, he believes, is not
enough

committee was discussed by Robbie
Sckslor. a member of both the sub-
committee and the Curriculum Corn»
mittee. under whose domain the sub
committee falls.

Sckalor and the two other commit
tee members, Pete Hautzinger and
Professor Philip Kintner have decided
on four changes they feel would help
alleviate acadeiruc stress. They sug»
gest that professors be required to
submit detailed syllabi listing all
course assignments to students early
enough in the scmeshar so that no
assignment can come as a surprise to
studenu. According h) Sekalor, sub-
committee members would also like
professors to assess st least one piece
of each student’s work before the
pass/fail option deadline so students
can make intelligent decisions about
the option. To enable professors to do
this, the sub-committee would like to
have the pass/fail option deadline ex-
tended.

The last change the subcommittee
thinks would alleviate academic stress
is the addition of an extra buffer day,
Sckalor said. The sub-committee was
told that the only way an extra buffer
day could be added to this semester's
calendar was by making the Saturday
following exams another exam day.
Sckalor urged joint board members to
solicit the opinions of their hall
members on the issue.

words about the future He hopes that
Reagan. given a second term. would
like to be “known as a man of peace
and a man who decreased the dangers
of the East-West tensions rather than
a man who simply blew them up to
greater intensity."

However, Kcnnan added that he
thinks Reagan “is a man who is very
much attached to the views he holds
and very stubborn about coming away
from them Some of those Views will
have to be changed."

"1 think he Will have to realee that
