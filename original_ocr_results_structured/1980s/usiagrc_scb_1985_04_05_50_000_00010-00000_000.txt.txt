Halting Mexican Immigration

On Thursday, April tl, Grinnell Col
legs will welcome United States Cone
gresssman Romano Mazzoli tin) to
campus. Mazzoli. who will be a speaker
in the Rosentield Program's immigra-
lion Symposium. will make a case lor
the massive immigration reiorm bill
\\ inch he coaautliored with Senator Alan
Simpson tiHiyt. and was approved by
the llousc of Representatives last year.

'lhe bill attempts to halt illegal im-
migration to the u.s. There are many
reasons lor its popularity. Some teel
that immigration is llooding our
domestic labor pools. thus cheating
Americans out of Jobs Others feel that
we are faced with a siluation conducive
to social unrest and general
”laulessiicss " Still others feel that it is
not good tor the us. to be continually
besieged by a ”large unassimilated
cultural minority. For example. Cola
orado Governor Richard Lamm sug~
gests tiiat continued immigration will
result in a "vast cultural separatism."
\tliatever the reason. there is a popular
tinstatcd sentiment that “America" is
ours and we ought not have to share it
\t ltli others.

immigration legislation in 1965
abolished the practice of setting im-
migration quotas according to national
origins in lavor oi “preference
categories," These categories lavor
citizens ol countries with a low demand
in immigration visas.

The version of the SimponaMazzoli
lilll passed last year in the House of
Representatives provides only lor
superficial changes to this tundamen-
tally inequitable application or im-
migration law. The Bill, which will be
reintroduced this year. is seen as a
model of generosity, primarily because
it offers amnesty for illegals who can
prove that they have been in this coun»
try SINCE 1981. But fundamentally, it is a
l'cstrictionist bill which under the guise
ol halting illegal immigration, seeks to
curtail overall immigration in the lon

growers to bring in otherwise illegal
aliens who would consequently have no

Another provision. the Roybal Ame
mendment. would have serious right to
privacy implications for the country‘s
workforce. It omits language in the bill
calling for a presidential study of a
"secure system“ to determine employ
ment eligibility. Representative Sala

ammendment would create institu-

Representative Norman Mieta (D-Cal.)
warned: “The 11.5, has abused its
authority once and could abuse it again
il some national identification system
were created."

Further provisions address the pro
blem of enforcement of the bill. One
ammendment provides for stricter
punishment ot employers who hire il-
legal aliens. Representative Robert
Garcia (DVN.Ylt points out that this
ammendment would be discriminatory
because employers. cut of the fear of
workers' use of false identification,
would be deterred from hiring
“foreignappearing” workers. Another
ammendment would double patrol
torces on the Mexican-American
border. However, as the immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS)
points out. our Mexican border is tar
too extensive to significantly slow down
immigration.

Many believe that immigrant
workers are undermining the American
economy by displacing “American"
«workers and filling the weltare roles.
Very lew illegal aliens apply lor
welfare benefits for fear of being iden-
tified. Provisions of the bill give
legalized immigrants the right to
emergency medical treatment but not
comprehensive health care. These
same immigrants earn money and
spend it in the economy. in the words of
Garcia. the bill creates second Class
citizens out or immigrants by creatinga
separate legal status for them, depriv-
ing them at legal and economic
privileges enjoyed by American
"citizens."

We. who arrived as immigrants, do
llothave theright to bar others from the
privileges which we have been given.
'l'rue immigration reform will abandon
legal-illegal as well as political»
economic distinctions: the question of
immigration policy is above all a moral
one. A Mexican farmer has as much
rlglit to enjoy this country‘s ailluence
as a German doctor.

The SimpsonaMazzoli Bill would
ultimately fail to alleviate the must
and classist characteristics which have
always typilied American immigration
policy ls this what we want to offer the
world on this side of the ”Golden
Door?"
