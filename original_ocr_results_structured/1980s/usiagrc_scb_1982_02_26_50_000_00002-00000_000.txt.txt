Students filled Main Lounge Tuesday
evening. Feb. 23. to hear Professors Beryl
Clotfelter. James Kissane. Al Jones and
Wayne Moyer debate the question of
whether mandatory interdisciplinary
courses should be reinstated in the
humanities, social studies and sciences.
Rosenfield Professor Joseph Wall acted as
moderator for the debate.

Wall opened the debate with What he
called “a couple of generalizations about
curricular changes at Grinnell." He said

. curriculum changes come in about ii-year
_ cycles and >Grinnell seems to‘ "rather

dismissals

"He l Drake I drew an analogy of himseli
as president. saying that ii the trustees of
the college decided they no longer wanted
him to serve as present. he would have to
leave." Hunt said. Renaud continued. "In
essence he told us. ‘Be grateful we allowed
you to tell your story. i wouldn't have had
the same chance.‘ "

testimony which took place on Jan. 14.
Renaud reiuted point by' point charges

sation oi the appeal hearing released to the

that the admmlstralotn‘s charge of "bad
judgment" reiers to the strain between the
academic computing stall and the ad-
ministrative computing stall

"This strain parlially resulted from
years of poor internal communications
between my two superiors iDireotor oi
Academic Computing Tom Moberg and
Grundlerl." Renaud wrote. ‘This strain
was augmented when the operations were
divided and It became clear that the

regular hours. Renaud wrote that much oi
his work necessitated use of the computer
system when it was "down." that he was
required to straighten out income

ministrative computing at night and that
he was to return to regular working hours
in early December. "No one questioned

you want to know what Grinnell‘s cur»
riculum is going to be like. look at what
Harvard has done in the past two or three
years, . . this is not to say occasionally
there aren't surprises. . . “

Wall actually hesitated to call the event
a debate, claiming he did not know what
sides the professors would be taking. None
of the speakers gave an unqualified yes or
no to the question. The format consisted of
a statement by each professor. their
responses to each other and a period of
questions from the audience.

contract required of me." Renaud wrote

interpreting the charge oi his unprofes
sinnal conduct as a reference to his
membership in the Tom Moberg Fan Club
lTMFCl. Renaud said the club made no

that his purposes in joining were "to cons

”The charge that I was 'Chairman of the
Board' ml the TMFCI is totally vacuous
insoiar as it implies that I was the
originator or leader of the club." Renaud
said. "All members of the club were given

to speaking with him and without ailowmg
him to present any iorm oi evidence "I

Grundler said. "The recruiters have shut

As a result oi the tension surrounding the

Renaud’s quotes which appeared in- a

He continued. 'll' he Is fired because I

o concensus reached

Among the points discussed were the ct
lectiveness oi mandatory science courses.
whether interdisciplinary courses are the
best way to teach skills. the level at which
to teach interdisciplinary courses and how
a new curriculum would affect admis-
sions

Clotfeltei‘ said that special courses are
needed for nonrscience students. rather
than requiring them to take the iirst year
courses for science majors. He explained
that the iirst-year science courses would
teach nonscience majors skills they would
not need to know and ignore areas of each
particular science the students should
learn.

Moyer raised the question oi whether
skills can best be provided by inter-
disciplinary courses. He said skill courses
should be taught under the auspices of
each department. Although not opposed to
interdisciplinary courses “per se, i think
their primary usefulness is at the upper
level," Moyer said. “when students have
mastered the methodlogy oi particular
disciplinﬁ and then can bring all their
skills together. . . "

Jones questioned Mayer's views saying
Moyer was espousing “departmentalism.”
He said, “What you're talking about is a
kind oi implicit assumption that
everybody should take every introductory
course in the sacral sciences division to ac
quire those particular departmental skills
so necessary to a liberally educated per-
son. . . There are ways to think about social
and political issues or problems which
transcend these particular departmental
methodologies." Moyer deiended his posi-
tion saying students should take not all but
some of the introductory courses. He sug-
gested that “people be encouraged to
develop new proposals ’consistant with
their interest, once they have basic groun-

ding in some oi the disciplines."

Student Brian Gratch asked how the pr0~
tessoi‘s thought the reinslltution of re-
quired Core courses would affect admis-
sions for the College Moyer said the
answer to Gratch's question depended on
how the word core was defined. Jones
responded saying he thought required core
courses might have a positive aiiect on ad-
missions. "I'm not sure that the college
Should admit students who are not
prepared to take certain requirements. .
students who come to the college ieeling
that it is sort of an open. flexible, ex
perimental. innovative. non-requirement
place. . . I'm not sure that those are the
students we want, if they come for that
reason,"

Toward the end of the discusSIon
Clotfelter offered that “bad as a core is, .
it at least is defensible on intellectual
grounds. [think it‘s indefensible practical-
ly." He referred to Wall‘s earlier remark
about Grinnell following Harvard‘s lead,
saying he hoped that would not happen,
“To simply say you have to take uiree
courses In each division. . . which I think is
very much what Harvard has now, is in-
defensible on intellectual grounds. There
is no way to say that any three coursu are
equivalent to something else," said
Clotfelter.

Kissane said that the selling points of
Grinnell may be different in three or four
years when any curricular changes are ei-
fective. “I would guess that whatever
glamor an open curriculum has now it
would have considerably less glamor in
three or (our years. . . my guess is that the
college will face. . , tremendous pressure
to lay‘its cars on the table and detend its
curriculum on some grounds more ex-
plicable than just open options.”
