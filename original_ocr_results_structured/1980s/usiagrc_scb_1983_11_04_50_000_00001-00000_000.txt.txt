Grinnell College

 

by Ellen Piekalkiewicz

Congressman Tom Harkin (Dem-la.)
spoke to about fifty County Democram and
Grinnell College Faculty at the home of
Professor of Economics Robert Voertman
and Assistant Professor of Theater Babe
Voertman to raise funds for his U.S.
Senate Campaign against incumbent
Republican Senator Roger Jepsen last
Saturday.

According to campaign staffers. Harkin
will officially announce his candidacy on
the first of the year. The latest Des Moines
Register poll has Harkin leading Jepsen by
11 percent, 50 percent to 39 percent.

Democratic control of Congress,
especially the Senate, is important, Harkin
said, because currently a small band of
radical Republicans manipulate the
Senate according to their ideology which
does not represent the mainstream of
Republican thought.

Harkin, in addition, questions Reagan’s
foreign policy attitudes which, he says,
“are leading us down the wrong road.”
Reagan has drastically changed the
strategic and tactical concept of the
military, said Harkin.

Commenting on the recent terrorist
bomb explosion in Lebanon which killed
over 270 Marines, Harkin said the incident

displayed inadequate security and that
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
and President Reagan must be held
responsible. Harkin said ﬂint ﬂieUnited
States does have legitimate interests in die
Middle East, “but not in Lebanon.” Harkin
believes that the U.S. is trying to ac-
complish the impossible by attempting to
“bring peace to a people who have been
fighting for a 1,000 years.”

Harkin also said the recent U.S. invasion
of Grenada shows “total failure of our
foreign policy." According to Harkin, in»
vasion of Grenada violated the OAS and
the UN charters. and “cooperation widi
everyone, even the Cubans. would have
worked better."

narkin tried to downplay die import
ance of the latest _negiat‘er poll. He
is “a little concerned” about the poll
because he does not want supporters to
think he will have an easy race against in
cumbent Republican Roger Jepsen

“.lepscn has always come from behind
and he has between 3 and 5 million dollars
already in the bank," said Harkin.

Harkin said he believes the Iowa
Senatorial race will be one of me most imr
portant in the nation because it will deter-
mine whether the emergence of the New
Right will be a permanent change on the
Iowa political landscape.

 

 

Pub in the black---

"We survived the last quarter"

by Man Brodrick

Despite less income and fewer hours,
Pub manager Mitch Rowe remarked, “We
survived the last quarter,” in a Pub board
meeting Tuesday night. Professor of
Philosphy and Pub Board member Jack
Worley attributed the Pub’s decrease in in
come to a “10 percent drop in enrollment
and last year‘s senior class being gone,"
but the Board asserted that the Pub is in
the black, due largely m increases in Pub
Club Membership and pinball and jukebox
revenue.

in an income statement issued by the
Board, the net gain for the quarter ending
September 30 was $290.13, as opposed to a
net loss of $1,139.00 for the same period last
year. The most significant expenses listed
were wages ($2,433.94) and insurance
($1,036.00). Managerial wages were
delayed to pay for new mugs and repairs.

In an effort to bring in more business,

the Board considered bringing back live
entertainment. However, a lack of on—
campus bands has caused a problem for
the Board, which is looking for bands or
musicians. In Worley's words, “We want
to promote good music on campu.“

An increase in hours was proposed by
Board President Peter Hautzinger,
possibly in the form of an extended Happy
Hour.

A wage increase for night managers was
approved at the meeting and will go into
effect next week. The managers wages,
which ranged from $3.50 to $3.60 an hour,
will now range from $3.75 to $4.25 an hour.
Rowe said the raises were justified by the
“responsibility connected to the job."

Another problem addressed at the
meeting was the lack of student and facul-
ty knowledge about the Pub. Hautzinger
said, “The members of the Pub are invited
to sit in on Pub Board meetings, and they
are part—owners of the Pub.”

Parslow proposal on
leave until February

by Ken Scoﬂon

The faculty voted by an overwhelming
majority of 71-7, with in abstentions, to
consider changes in the Grinnell College
curriculum in the Faculty meeting. The
faculty also voted 51-37 to send the Parslow
proposal to the Curriculum Committee for
further study and amendment. The com-
mittee will have until February to com-
plete review of the Parslow proposal. The
matter will then be brought up before the
faculty next spring.

The faculty also endorsed a recommen-
dation by the Faculty Organization Com-
mittee not to extend the right to vote to
those professors on leave. This includes
those faculty who are on sabbatical but
have chosen to remain in Grinnell.

President George Drake opened Mona
day's meeting with an announcement to
students that “you are welcome as
auditors, but not as participants in the
debate.” Drake said he had allowed
students to speak at the last faculty
meeting, but had been informed since then
that faculty rules forbid this.

The Faculty‘s referral of Parslow’s pro-
posal to the Curriculum Committee was
preceded by statements by Rosenfield
Professor Joseph Wall, Rosenthal Pro~
fessor of Humanities Philip Kintner, and
Parker Professor of History Alan Jones.
Wall stated that he did not think the praca
ticality of implementing the curriculum
requirements as proposed by Parslow had
been considered well enough.

“We don’t need problem solving at this
point," said Wall, “but problem raising.”
One problem, according to Wall, was that
to meet the requirements of the Parslow
proposal, either the size of the faculty
would have to be enlarged, or the size of
some departments would have to suffer.
Wall felt that the Trustees would not sup—

' port enlargement of the Faculty, and

because of that, he urged the Faculty to
carefully consider the implications of die
Parslow proposal. Wall also said the

Faculty had incomplete information on the
impact of curricular change on admissions
and retentions of students. Wall suggested
the college look at the admissions of Brown
University that has a more open cur-
riculum and Harvard that has more struc-
tured curriculum.

Professor \Kintner echoed many of
Wall's sentiments. “We need to know what
we are voting for before we vote on it."
Kintner said it's “the most pernicious
argument to think this is the best we can
do." He said that as of yet there has been
“no opportunity to suggest alternatives
and make comparisons."

Professor Jones called the Parslow pro-
posal “incomplete and sometimes in—
coherent.” Jones said he thought that most
of the requirements of the proposed cur-
riculum were already being met.
However, he thought the move from an
open curriculum to one where there are
general requirements for 48 Credits was
not wise. Jones men moved that ﬁle
Parslow proposal be referred to the Curr
riculum Committee “as an appropriate
way to study it as well as other alterv
natives" rather than before the entire
Faculty.

Some Faculty questioned the usefulness
of Jones's move complaining that it would
do nothing more than delay the vote. It was
also brought into question whether or not
there was sufficient interest among the
faculty for curriculum requirements to
warrant the time and effort it would take
the committee to study the matter.
Associate Professor of Biology Lenore
Durkee motioned for arstraw vote to gau-
ge faculty interest in curricular change,
which passed overwhelmingly on the heels
of Jone‘s motion to refer the Parslow pro-
posal to Faculty Organization Committee
for more study. The faculty voted in favor
of referral, 51 to 37.

The faculty then agreed to a straw votc.
Seventy—one voted yes; seven voted no;
and ten abstained.

Joint Board forms
Committee on
Student Politics

by M. Wolfgang Schumann

The new Committee on Student Politics
is being formed. Mark Lambert has been
appointed and confirmed as chairman.
and Dave Kopelman will be one other
member. The open slots wil] be filled next
week as applications are taken.

The new committee is intended to Lake
responsibility for helping students present
their own political resolutions to Joint
Board. it was formed largely as a result of
the efforts of Kopelman to make SGA more
involved in political issues. The committee
is specifically denied the authority to
change in any way the substance of a
resolution, however.

Both Lambert and Kopelman applied
and were interviewed for the diairman-
ship. While nautzinger said he had had a
hard time deciding who to recommend for
the position, he finally decided on Lambert
as, chairman and Kopelman as a commits
tee member. Raff Stein, chairman of
PASF (Political Activities Support Fund)

questioned Lambert's appointment. He
wanted to know if it was proper for Hautz-
inger to make the committee assignment.

In new business, Mike Oxman wanted or
reconsider college policy on dogs in our
campus, college-owned houses. Under cur-
rent policy, dogs are not allowed to live on
any collegeowned housing, “In my opi-
nion." stated Oxman, “it would seem that
a house is the perfect place for a dog . . . it
just seems reasonable.” SGA does not
have jurisdiciton in the matter, but 0x-
man, who represents residents of . off»
campus, collegeowned housing, promised
to look into it further and hopes that Joint
Board will present its recommendation to
the college administration.

Hautzinger knew of the particular dog in
question. which had been owned by a a Stu»
dent who had been told to get rid of it dur»
ing October break; the dog returned with
its owner last Monday. He said that
possibly this one dog could be made an ex-
ception to the rule, but that “[i]t might be
opening a Pandora's box.”
