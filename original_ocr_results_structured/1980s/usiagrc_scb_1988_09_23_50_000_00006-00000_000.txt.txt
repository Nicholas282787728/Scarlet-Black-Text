—Letter Policy—

Letters to the editor are a very important aspect of our
newspaper. However, there are ground mics which must be
followed to ensure that letters are in the best interests of all

parties concerned.

We encourage letters and Will print them intact as soon as
time and space permit. Letters in poor taste, judged to be
libelous or not following the guidelines will not be published.

Letters must be signed when they are submitted for
publication. Names will be withheld upon request only in
very rare instances. If it is clear that printing a name will
jeopardize someones employment or personal wellrbcing, then
they will be withheld. We will print an anonymous letter
only after consulting with the author.

The deadline for letters is midnight the Tuesday before
publication. Letters must be submitted either via the Vax
system (tell Scarlet) or through campus mail (typed).

Grinnell forms Progressive
Student Network chapter

To the Editor:

A Grinnell chapter of the
Progressive Student Network
(PSN). a national students'
movement based in Iowa City,
has formed .on campus. The
group's goals include bringing
students together to work on a
variety of causes: including tlte
battle against sexism,
homophobia, and racism;
0 p p e s i t i o n t o
aggressive/imperialist foreign
policy in Central America: and
the struggle to end Apartheid in
South Africa.

The "WE ARE
RESPONSIBLE/ END
APARTHEID/ DIVEST NOW"
banners hanging from ARI-I and
Burling Library, as well as the
North and South campus loggias,
were made and hung up by the
Grinnell PSN in order to drive

home to the Grinnell community
the fact that Apartheid is a great
problem and that we are in fact
partially responsible for its
perpetuation.

While Grinnell has sold some
of its stock in companies dealing
in SouLh Africa, Grinnell main-
tains over ten million dollars of
such stock. Ownership of stock
in such companies as IBM and
Shearson/Lehman supports the
repressive regime in South Africa
by bastioning its economic secu-
rity. Money we have invested in
such companies could easily be
transferred to other, more accept-
able investments without
threatening the financial security
of the college.

Student protests KDIC's
"discriminatory" criteria

To the Editor:

Coming from a country
where there are four official
languages, I am used to listening
to diverse music. Radio stations
in Switzerland broadcast songs in
English, German, Italian. and
French, and nobody seems to
mind that they do not understand;
they either ask somebody or
concentrate more on the beat.

Coming to America I realized
that not ail radio stations are so
international. And so, I was
really happy that in the last two
years KDIC had some foreign
language programs. However, I
do not understand KDIC's policy
this semester. Two multi-
national and one Spanish radio
shows applied for time slots in
the KDIC program. They wanted
to play international or Spanish
music and also offered cultural
information about different
countries. Many international
students. language students and
Americans could have proﬁted of
these shows. However, none of
the three was accepted.

The reason these shows were
turned down, I was told later, was
that too "many good shows ap,
plied for the same good slots (69
P.M,). There are two
implications from this statement:
According to KDIC selection
criteria, inlcmational radio shows
are not to be valued as "good",
or, because of the large pool of
applicants for those same time
slots, international radio shows
were unlucky and should have
compromised to a lessrlistened to
time slot.

However, examining exactly
which shows made it into these
precious time slots, there are
three shows with the same music
orientation--all Dance! There are
other styles of American music
like Progressive and Rock that
have been scheduled with great
frequency. All this makes me
conclude that not the time slots
or luck was the problem. but
rather the narrow and
discriminatory criteria of the
KDIC selection committee. I

really wish that the committee
would have respected and been
more fair to people with different
language and music tastes.

In conclusion, I want to point
out that one Of the main
criticisms Grinnell students have
about the college is 'that it lacks
diversity. Yet, through this
international radio show example.
students mm were given
the opportunity to increase
diversity, and tumod down the
chance.

In addition I want to point
out that Wayne Seaman
(chairman of the KDIC selection
committee) was very
understanding and offered ISO to
have one of the reserved time
slots in this semester in
consolation. He also pointed out
that he likes European music and
listens to it frequently. To me,
Wayne's actions did unfortunately
not measure up to his words.

president)

National Book Banning Week:
The fight against censorship

To the Editor:

The week from Sept, 25 to
Oct. 1, which begins in two
days, is known as National Book
Banning Week. This is not a
week where one is supposed to
support the banning of books.
As far as I know, there is no such
week. This is the week where we
are supposed to oppose it, In
order to do this, we must know
what book banning is, and why it
is wrong.

If a school district removes
Huckleberry Finn from its
reading list because of the
appearance of the word "nigger,"
that is obvious book banning.
However, the same people who
scream "Free Press!" when such
things occur, will sit idly by
when people write to newspapers
complaining about being offended
by an editorial cartoon, and
suggesting such a cartoonist
should no longer be printed.

However, an editorial cartoon
is supposed to be satirical and, by
definition, is supposed to satirize
someone or something. There-
fore, someone will always be of-
fended. A newspaper, novel, or
any work of literature that relies
on opinion cannot please
everyone all of the time, As Ray
Bradbury said in an afterward to
his novel Fahrenheit 451 (Lhe
temperature at which book paper
catches fire. and burns), "There is
more than one way to burn a

book. And the world is full of
people running about with lit
matches. Every minority, be it
Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Ital-
ian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist,
Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist,
Women's Lib/Republican,
Mattachine/Four Square Gospel
fuels it has the will, the right, the
duty to douse the kerosene. light
the fuse." Burning and banning
books are one and the same. If
minorities are allowed to rip
pages from books, a tow here, a
few there, the day will come
wllen the "books [are] empty, the
minds shut, and the libraries
closed forever."

The process of removing
from public access any Work of
literature merely because you do
not agree with it, because it
offends you, that is book
banning. Another term people
use for it often is censorship.
Censorship applies to all forms
of organized thought: art.
literature, science (e. g. Dari
win’\ ), etc. All thought is by
definition the thought of an indi-
vidual. and no one thinks exactly
the same, so therefore all thought
will offend at least one person. If
the written word should truly hot
be allowed to offend, then
nothing except mere fact can be
printed. Have you read the

Encyclopedia recently?
Wonderful reading. But even it
would have to be edited, since
many people disagree on what the
facts are.

How can we stop censorship
from occuring? Write a letter to
the editor of your local newspa-
per, but don't complain about the
publishing of an offensive letter.
Instead, write a letter praising the
newspaper for offering a variety
of opinions. Praise the paper for
its coverage of controversial top-
ics. If they get enough of such
letters, the editors will be less
likely to think twice before
printing something that might
receive some negative feedback.

Most importantly, and this
may be hard for some
Grinnellians to understand, don't
give in to minorities. Sure, we
must protect the minorities‘
rights to speech, but we can't
protect them from being attacked.
Providing immunity to one
minority will automatically
infringe on another minority's
rights. Freedom of speech is
only restricted by libel and
slander laws. Don‘t remain silent
in fear of offending someone.
Offend them. This society was
built on conflict and controversy
and will grow and ﬂourish only
under the same. .l o h n
