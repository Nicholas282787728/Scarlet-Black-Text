Inward Bound Perspective
on Returning

by Profi Alan |ones
Scarlet & Black, May 28, 1974

That Grinnell, especially Grinnell in the
spring, has changed in the last few years is
obvious to anyone familiar with the Cole
lege. One does not need the perspective ate
iorded by a sabbatical year's absense to
see these changes, but the return irom a
leave in England in the pastoral environs
of Cambridge University reinforces cer-
tain impressions oi the nature oi the
change,

Between 1966 and 1972, spring in Grinnell
was a season anticipated with iorbodmg by
administrators, who over this period
developed a certain style oi "crisis
management" in response to local varia~
lions oi the national phenomena 7 the cen-
tral campus turned into a vast graveyard
one beautiiul morning to herald the visit oi
a Marine recruiter, the upside down 7 in
ternational distress signal ilag — incident,
the three day moratorium aiter the
assassination oi Martin Luther King to
discuss the report oi the National Advisory
Commission oi Civil Disorder, the
apocalyptic days aiter Kent State and the
early closing oi the College, and the week
long candlelight marches in the town after
the mining oi Haiphong in the spring oi
1972,

Academic continuities were challenged
by the intervention of national political
events and local political sensiblities, With
reason, some administrators, iaculty, and
students then [eared the politicalization of
the College. They now look back with
anger at the experience, grateiul that it is
Over and that the College has returned to
quieter springs and to narrower academic
endeavors

l coniess certain nostalgia ior the spr-
ings oi the recent past and am not all that
sanguine about the present. Between 1966
and 1972 the challenge oi a national
political crisis was a clear and present

reality Given the traditions of the College,
positive response to this challenge was to
be anticipated, and I iind little to regret
about the general nature tand the
civility) oi the response that was made,

The College is an ambiguous institution,
looking outward to the large society and in
ward to itself. The problem of maintaining
a balance between its outward and inward
preoccupations is a complex one, raising
important issues of the relationships bet
ween thought and action, knowledge and
power, consciousness and society, At
times, the balance is overthrown e too
radical an outlook takes the institution in—
to power and society, into activist and
”relevant" improvement at the expense oi
thought and contemplation Something oi
the reverse is happening now

My impression oi the College this year is
that it is turning inward rather rapidly;
caught up in self-examination, it has been
more preoccupied with the question oi its
own governance than with the governancy
oi America, more preoccupied with
evaluation of itself and its members than
with the evaluation oi the world These are
valid preoccupations

But inwardeturning can be resigned
withdrawal; it can be a cynical and
irivolous escape. And this can happen easi-
ly when a pastoral and provincial place
isolates itself even further from the world.

This year I have sensed moods of
resignation, cynicism, and trivolity,
moods that have accompanied a driiting
quest ior a sense oi direction in the College
as a whole and among many oi its in
dividual members — among iaculty and
administrators anxious about their
careers and the College's future, and
among students discontented with
themselves and their local situtation, look
ing for alternatives in "o campus study"
and preproiessional training. But Com~
pared to the late ’605, everyone's sense or
alternatives is much diminished. The most

Conservative Conundrums?

by Mary Beth George
Scarlet & Black, February 21, 1975

Two years ago i spent the semester at
Grinnell-inliongon with 50 others, We
didn’t miss campus life much. Only occar

sionally, twinges oi curiosity moved us to ,

write to iriends ior news. We read their
replies and the packets oiS&B‘s that arriv.
ed at the teaching site with a detachment
we couldn't have attained living on came
pus, From our distance, we saw how little
liie changed here over a period or time,
Our iriends wrote about the usual: the cold
temperatures, the routine oi studying. and
once in a ivhile the latest pieces oi gossip.

Friends also sent us a running commen»
tary on that year's ireshman class. Little
oi what they said was new on that account
either, We'd said the same things about the
previous year's freshmen, and up-
perclassmen had said it about us when we
were ireshmen. “Conservative," our
friends wrote, “more and more conser-
vative. They dress like preppies, the
women look and act just like coeds, and
most oi them are pre~med or preelaw The
campus is going down the drain."

During my year and a hall back on came
pus complaints about the inilux oi consere
vative students and attitudes have been
heard oiten on the lips oi many Certain
events, such as the new alcohol and
bathroom policies and the move to set up
distribution requirements, are pointed to
as prooi that Grinnell College is becoming

a bastion of conservatism, Those who con-
sider themselves progressiveminded reel
more than ever in the minority, Consere
vatism, in many students' minds, is the
hottest issue around.

The accusation that a conservative
irame oi mind characterizes most oi the
student body and some oi the iaculty cone
tains some validity Many students now
going to school here think and act accore
ding to values widely considered "conven-
tional" and "Establishment." The ad-
ministration and iaculty are interested in
new regulations that would mean a return
to certain conventional restrictions on the
generally regulationel'ree student liiestyle.

The accusation ol conservatism is
perhaps as ironic as it is valid. Those who
accuse are trying to preserve a tradition oi
their own, to resist thedisappearance oi
the liberal, anlieEstablishment order that
existed on this campus during the '60 and
early 7% strange as it may seem, those
who now consider themselves among the
last survwors of that progressive era must
also admit to their own brand of consere
vatism.

So, some are returning to a traditional
Establishment lifestyle, and some are
striving to maintain the anti-
Establishment lifestyle that arose to op-
pose it Is it an unimportant semantic point
that both groups are conservative in their
own ways?

ambitious and interesting educational eX'
periment has been a modest return to
something like old HumanitieseHistorical
studies requirements oi the lane 19505.

Perhaps this is the only meaningiul
alternative, a return to the traditions oi
liberal learning, to the aim oi creating
“educated persons” in a iour year respite
tor the cares oi the world. whether this is a
viable alternative or even a satisiactory
one, given the nature oi the present cares
oi the world, is open to question The
perspective irom England and Cambridge
oiiers no Clear vision,

Cambridge is an ancient place with pro-
ud traditions ot liberal learning- it has
long been a provincial and inwai' looking
place, detached irom the cares oi the
world, pleasant in the spring when
students play croquet on the banks ot the
Cam. It is not only the Similarity between
croquet playing on central campus and
croquet playing on the Cam that leads me
to note resemblances between Grinnell
and Cambridge. Cambride has pubs; we
have a “pub"; Cambridge has “boat
races" and June Week. we have the Grins
nell Relays; Cambridge has daiiodils; we
have ilowering crabs.

There are not many other similiarities,
but my ieelings last spring that Cam-
bridge was rather cynically, irivolously,
and enjoyably isolated irom the “condition
oi England” question is not unlike my pre
sent feeling that Grinnell runs certain
dangers in its inwardeturning phase.

There is a “condition of America" ques-
tion, a continuing national crisis. I'm not
sure how the graduates of the Class of 1974
or of ensuing classes will respond to it I
hope they will retain something oi the
outwardelooking style, the traditions oi the
recent past, of the classes of '68 or '70 Dr
'72.

Not necessarily. This semantic point can
be constructive ii, in response, the
“liberals" who abhor the return oi conven~
tional values call into question the depth of
their progressivism More than the usual
liberal ideas make a progressive person.
Also needed is an understanding that
changes in attitudes is inevitable, whether
here or in the “real world "

Many oi us need to be willing to accept
and deal with the iact that a change has oce
curred in the attitudes oi the people, in
stead or writing it oiias a hopeless turn ior
the worse Most people, however conven-
tional they have become, somehow have
been aiiected by the ideas oi the 1305 and
early ’705, and are not likely to be as blind
ly apathetic as everyone supposedly ivas
during the '505.

Grinnell is a unit oi a large society. in
many ways it is like larger communities
elsewhere. as the rest ol our society
becomes less radical, more conventional,
so does Grinnell. The College is not a
haven oi liberal reiugees. Nor is it a place
one enters hoping to iind a small liberal
utopia that does not change under the in-
iluence oi pressures irom other parts oi
society,

in reiusing to acknowledge and deal with
the trend toward conventionalism in peoe
ple's attitudes here, those with liberal
views risk the iaults they point out in those
they label conservative — complacency
and narrowmindedness. ‘

tourselves and each other

With our head

out of the sand

by Ed Hirsch
Scanet & Black, April 20, 1979

Grinnel] College is sick. Its health has
been deteriorating for some time now and
shows no real signs of improvement, In the
last week, two additional symptoms have
appeared which have caused me to write
this, not with the expectation of achieving
a ny radical changes, but rather in the hope
that we will stop and think for a minute
about what is happening here

The past week saw a symposium on what
is reierred to as the “food crisis," a press
ing international problem. in spite oi its
importance, an average oi perhaps only to
percent of the audience was students on
any one evening, in the same week it was
announced that a committee had been
iormed to ,consider requests irom die
community for studenteinitiated hall lmr
provements, to make recommendations on
such requests to the Physical Plant... and
to work. on all-campus aesthetic im-
provemen. The physical plant director
was made responsible to the committee for
explaining the impracticality oi denied re
quests.” The committee is to have three
students-al»large on it, and to date only one
position has been applied ior.

”Too much work to do" is the general
reason given ior students' nonparticipa-
tion in these events, There are some
studnts who did have too much work to do
during the week oi the iood symposium
a nd unfortunately had to miss the sessions.
However, I believe that oftentimes
“academic pressure” becomes a flippant
excuse ior burying one's head in the sand.
Regulations on student liie are largely con
trolled by the students themselves, as
evidenced by total domination of student-
life committees by students,

The sickness I refer to is the "Ain't it
Awful" syndrome which I would
characterize as basically a look-out-iore
yourself attitude which assumes that so»
meone else will do what needs to be done
because you can't aiiord the time away
irom studying. grad schoools and all, you
know. Hail Improvements Committee?
Well, we know that someone else will
volunteer and besides, committees never
do anything anyway. And ii I‘d volunteer
I'd look like a fool . I got to study . but 507
meone else will do it and I wish someone
would do something about these institu-
tionalized white walls! Ain't it awful.

Somehow we have come to the point
where we not only assume that these jobs
are someone else's responsibility, but that
there is actually a RISK in going to a syms
posium or getting involved in a committee
since we would be losing precious studying
time,

The fight for the establishment of the
women's gynecological service to Des
Moines provides another example oi these
assumptions and also illustrates a con-
tradiction in students' attitudes. We pro-
claim that the doctrine of "in loco parenr
tis“ is no longer valid, we are adults and
the College 5 ould not dictate our life
styles, e g “you must be in your dorm by
midnight." At the same time, some
demanded that the College has no obliga-
tion to provide any health care at all, just
as it has no right to tell you when you must
be in your dorm.

I do not mean to suggest that we should
not have a gynecological serviceion the
contrary, it is a program iuliilling the
needs oi a segment oi our community. The
point is thatmost people thought the risk to
their grade-point was too great to get in
volved in establishing the service. Too
oiten we say "somebody should do
something. , i can't, I have to study."

i guess what I'm trying to say is that
there is a certain community responsibli-
ty, for lack of a better term, which has
been neglected in the recent past, Perhaps
it is an unwillingness to realize that the
freedom to paint one '5 room or to be driven
to the gynecologist costs somebody else
time and effort, and that we owe it to
to try in
someway to make this community oi ours
a more livable place,
