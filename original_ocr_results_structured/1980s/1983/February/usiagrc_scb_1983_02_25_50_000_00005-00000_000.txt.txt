Mail, as a concept, is rather interesting.

If you eVer stand in the Post Office and
watch the reactions of people as may open
their boxes, you'll get an idea of what I’m
talking about. Obviously, mail is
something that is very important to the
average college student — l think it has
something to do with it being a connection
with the outside, a.k.a. “real" world. Yet
as soon as people open up their box, all
they do is complain “What, no mail from
home?” “More meaninglus garbage."
“Doesn’t anyone care about me?"

But the thing I find amazing about the
whole concept of mail is junk mail. Mail,
by its very nature, is personalized; it
comes addressed to you. But junk mail,
although addressed specifically to you, is
really not [or you — it’s for your name.
That is, you get the mail not because you
are you, but because you are your name,
and a computer somewhere felt your name
would like the mail.

Computers really have enabled junk
mail artists to perfect their craft. When
you make the mistake of expressing an in-
terest in something intelligent like a news
magazine, you open yourself up to a
veritable plague of junk mail.

In my Case, I can’t Win. I subscribe to
two weekly magazines, two professional
journals, and I made the grievous error of

Richard Letcbinger

joining the Columbia Record Club. They’re
the folks who will send you 800 tapes for a
dollar and not let you quite me club for 10
years or until you give them your first»
born son, whichever comes first. What all
this really means is that every computer in
America has my name.

Iwill admit that it's kind of interesting to
see what comes though. I think every Grin-
nellian was welcomed back to school with
a note from Newsweek telling them that
their name (remember, not you, just your
name) could win $20,000. Also, every
senior I know got a note from Sears ex-
plaining that now that we are about to be
college grads we should be thinking about
propagating the American dream and in-
curring debt; hence, they wanted us to
open charge accounts. Viva la plastiquel

At about this point you should be wonderr
ing why I’ve entered into this treatise
about junk mail. Well, last week, I may
have reached the pinnacle of junk
maildom. Yes, even better than the
homecraft catalogs addressed to Mrs. R.
Letchinger, i received a letter from Oral
Roberts University.

They want me. They want me bad
enough to offer me a tree weekend; I pay
the transportation, and they pick up the
“meals, hotel accommodations and enter»
tainment." oh baby, I‘m really tempted
because they say I “will also receive free

tickets to the Saturday afternoon baseball
game between ORU and Minnesota." They
go on to mention something about a luxury
,hotel, but, as you may know, ORU is
located in Tulsa, and in my book the words
Nsa and luxury don’t jive.

But here’s the real kicker: this free trip
is‘ scheduled over Easter weekend, and the
invitation comes from the graduate school
of theology.

What can i say'! i was truly touched by
their offer of kindness. It is just the kind of
thing I would expect from a school named
after Oral Roberts. I like his show; he
doesn‘t use the hard sell method. Instead
he has his whole family there singing, and
then we're treated to a friendly word from
his wife whose name is either Kaka, Kiki
or Kinky # I‘m never sure.

I’m not going to grad school, and if I did
it would more likely be in law or business
than in theology, and there are some fun»
damental differences between my
religious beliefs and those espoused by
ORU. So why in the world was I lucky
enough to get such a lavish invitation? I‘ll
tell you why. It proves my theory that com»
puters are sending things to our names,
that these machines are taking over the

world. That it’s all a commie plot, WE '

MUST STOP THEM! it
Or maybe somebody just sent ORU my
name as a joke.

 

...I hope I

in a recent conversation precipitated by
Jonathon Young's article, “I Can‘t Kill,
Can You?" (Scarlet and Black Feb. 11,
1933), I found myself hard pressed to give
a defensible answer to his question. The
question is one of particular relevance and
exceptional difficulty. Speaking for
myself, Idon’t know i. Ican kill, andlhope
Inever have to find out. The thought of kill-
ing another human being is entirely
repulsive to me, but I cannot in good cons—
cience deny that, in certain unfortunate
but all to conceivable circumstances, kill-
ing is not only just, but necessary.

Historically, the morality of killing has
always been a troublesome issue. “Thou
shalt not kill” is the Sixth Commandment,
but the Bible praises David for killing
Goliaﬁl and leading the Israelites to
massacre thousands of Annonites and
Philistines. The rise of Christianity
brought scorn upon the Old Testament
“eye for an eye” morality, but St.
Augustine was quick to offer the distinc-
tion between a “just war" and an unjust
one. In a just war one must kill, but in an
unjust war, to kill is a mortal sin,

In the state of nature, “life,” according
to Thomas Hobbes, “is nasty, brutish and
short." Each man, like a wild animal,
fends for himself and, like the animals,
kills whenever the forces of nature in-
dicate that it might be expedient. It is the
conventions of civilization, the “social con-
tract,” which allows us the luxury of a
moral code to protect us from the violent
impulses of our fellows. Killing is unciviliz-
ed behavior; thus, we call it “barbaric."
And besides, it is not very pleasant to
watch nor even to contemplate (especially
from the victim’s point).

Unfortunately, the conventions of
political society have been known to breat:
down. History has shown us, more than
once, the sort of barbarism which compels
moral men to wage just wars in their
denfense. Such figures as Gengis Khan, At-

never have

to

Bennett Las/eo

tilla the Hun and Adolf Hitler have per,
rorized the innocent and benevolent and
slaughtered helpless millions. We must
face the fact that humanity is capable of
producing such monstrous figures. How
many people could honestly claim that our
fathers were morally wrong to fight in
World War II? How can we justify sitting
idly by and letting them (Khan, Attilla the
Hun, Hitler) go about their gruesome
business? In such cases, full scale milimry
opposition must be considered both just
and necessary.

This does not mean that every time we
rally ‘round the flag to defend freedom and
Christianity we are fighting a just war.
(Nor, for that matter, does a just war
mean open season on our fellow man.) The
crusades are the classic example of self-
righteous atrocity in the name of God.

Likewise, the war in Vietnam was a
piti[ully corrupt and misguided so—called
defense of freedom and democracy. There
was nelther need nor justification for the
killing in Vietnam, but our country waged
war there (and tried very hard to tell us
that it was just). Young men were told to
kill for (at best) poorly conceived reasons.
Some did, not knowing any better until too
late, and some refused. Those who reins
ed, though portrayed as traitors and
subversives at the time, are the heros of to-
day's pacifists. it was they who showed us,
not in word but in deed, that we are each
responsible for our own decision to kill or
not to kill.

As is often the tendency, many people in
terpret the example of Vietnam too nar-
rowly and cite its injustices as grounds to
condemn all acts of violence and war. of
fensive and defensive alike. While I refuse
to accept that we ought to kill thousands of
Vietnamese people In order to liberate
their country and protect them from Coma
‘munism (shudder, shudder), when a made

from the face of me earth, it is time to
resist by whatever means available. This,
unfortunately, includes killing people.

There are still those who would disagree
and maintain that killing for any reason,
under ‘any circumstances, is morally
wrong. These people are properly called
pacifists, provided that they are responSI-
ble and conscientious in meir reasoning, It
is not enough to say. “I would prefer to be
killed than to kill someone;" one must be
able to say. “I would prefer anything over
killing someone.” (Remember, this is a
question of moral. not aesthetic
preferences.) A true pacifist must, for ex~
ample, believe that it is better to watch
children he maimed, killed and molested
than to kill someone in their defense. A
true pacifist must be willing to see his
friends and family slaughtered while
knowing that he, with the pull of a trigger,
could save them. If one cannot agree that
these are morally preferable to killing so-
meone, then one cannot justifiably claim
the title of “pacifist".

it is also entirely unsatifactory to say “I
suppose it would be OK to kill someone to
save the children, but I Wouldn’t do it."
Moral precepts must be applied equitably.
If it is morally right for you to kill, then it
is your moral duty, not someone else’s. I
think that if everyone were to give the mat-
ter some very careful thought, there would
be few people who could honestly call
themselves pacifists.

This, then, is the responsibility which we
all face: to consider the matter very
carefully and very seriously. It is very
easy (not to mention very “hip") to
casually condemn violence and killing in
all forms. But it is not so easy to think the
matter through and bear the full respon-
sibility for all the implications of one's
judgements. Each man is equally respon-
sible for the lives he takes as well as for
those ,he allows to be taken.

' One of the drawbacks of attending a
small, sheltered college is the tendency for
many of the students to develop an ex—
tremely ethnocentric viewpoint. Here at
Grinnell, I have discovered that this is
often the case. When some people here go
about defending a cause or espousing their
beliefs on the latest pertinent issue, the
most important consideration in nearly
every instance is how it immediately af-
fects those people of Grinnell Couege.
Rarely are the far-reaching or universal
ramifications appraised. ,

Last week I read two articles in the
Scarlet and Black concerning the drinking
age in Iowa, and I feel that both Viewpoints
are completely sell-serving and stunted by
ethnocentricity. The immediate response
to an increase in the drinking age is, “But
what about the Pub? !" or “What about our
social lives'.’ !" (Of course let’s not forget,
”But what about Relays?!”.) Yet, if the
students on this campus were as
thoughtful and socially aware as they
claim to be, their concerns would turn
away from the Pub and the immediate
social implications, and they would con-
sider the real issue at stake here—human
lives,

It is difficult for anyone to judge how ef-
fective raising the drinking age would be,
but nevertheless, two points are quite
clear:

1) The accidents and deaths to drunk
teenagers and the accidents and deaths
caused by drunk teenagers are the rule.
not me exception.

2) if the drin ing age was raised to 2i
there would be a larger number of
teenagers who would be unable to obtain
alcohol (although some would be able to
circumvent this law).

The realization must be made that Grin-
nell College is not a good representation of
the general population of Iowa. We do not
all hop into Cars alter a few hours at the
Pub, hut everywhere else in Iowa people
must go home, and they do not all live
within walking distance of the bars.

Many teenagers cross the border from
Illinois, and they too must drive home. A
large percentage of these people may be
able to judge their ability to handle alcohol
and automobiles, but this capacity to judge
diminishes with age, as the statistics pro-
ve.

Every time a “rowdy" teenager looking
for a good time goes to the bars it is almost
inevitable that he will become intoxicated.
And every time this teenager leaves the
bar drunk it is almost inevitable that he
will have to drive home. The greater the
number of teenagers who engage in this
activity, the greater the chance that an ac-
cident will occur, But remember, ﬂ’lis
teenager is endangering not only his own
life, but the life of every other person on
the road with him. ‘

My purpose here is not to defend the pro-
posal of raising the drinking age, but
rather to point out that there is something
more substantial at stake here than simply
the Pub or Relays. Before everyone jumps
on the bandwagon I would hope to see
more thoughth and mature consideration

 

 

with respect to this issue.

Just think of the number of people who
had loved ones killed by drunk teenagers.
Could you defend the existence of the Pub
or alcohol at Relays to them?
