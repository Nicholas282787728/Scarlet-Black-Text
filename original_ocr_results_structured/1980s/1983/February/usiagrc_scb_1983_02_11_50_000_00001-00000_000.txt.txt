Funaro gets

suspended
sentence

by Terri Porter

Janette Funaro, a student at Grinnell
College, is one of many concerned about
nuclear warfare, Unlike a lot of people,
however, she has made her views known.
On Dec. 14, 1932, Funaro, along with nine
others, was arraigned on the charge of
“reentering a military ’installation”
without the proper authority, she pleaded
“no contest," as did the others, and receiv»
ed a two months suspended sentence and a
one year probation. This decision means
that if Funaro violates the terms of her
probat’ n, she will be subject to two monr
ths in j l,

The arraignment, although it took place
during finals' week, did not affect Funaro
in any adverse way, Besides taking the
time to travel to Omaha and having to pay
the expenses, she said. ”It [the entire
ordeal] was probably like taking another
really hard final."

About the possiblity of spending time in
jail, Funaro commented, “In the company
of the people who were there [at the ar-
raignment], I probably could have handl-
ed going to jail,” she continued, “I'm not
any grander than the others [currently in
jail for civil disobedience]. If they can
tolerate it, then I should be able to. I've
been preparing for it for a long time,

Funaro believes in taking at stand for
what she thinks is right—at times
disregarding the consequences. This is
shown in her actions which led to the are
raignment. Funaro's first entry into a
military installation was into Offutt Air
Base in Omaha, Neb,, were the Strategic
Air Command is headquartered and, ac-
cording to Funaro, where all U.S. land and
airbase missles are based.

She entered the base Dec. 28, 1931, Wind
20 people, They were, noted Funaro, pros
testing “the deprivation of social funds for
military use.” They picked Dec. 23
because it is the “Feast of the Holy In~
nocents" and commemorates the innocent
people killed in Nagasaki and Hiroshima
in 1945 as well as the many innocent people
who may be harmed in the event of a
nuclear war,

Funaro reentered the base Aug. 9, 1982,
along with so others Their purpose in get-
ting behind the gates was “to give a
prepared statement to the Joint strategic
Target Planning Staff” stating the need
for disarmament. Two months later, she
received her notice regarding the arraign-
ment.

Even though Funaro had a trying ex-
perience, she says she would do it all over
again. However, since a special condition
of her probation is that she not enter a 11.5.
military installation without the expressed
consent of a commander, she does not
foresee herself going into another installa-
tion within the year.

She stated, “I feel like, at this point in
my life, I want to get an education, and I
can't do that if I'm in jail." She added, “I
have to compromise myself, and that's ter~
rible because we shouldn’t have to come
promise ourselves.” Funaro did allow,
however, for the possibility of an event
arising which would force her into a situa~
tion where she might be sent to jail.

On the whole, Funaro feels as though she
has been changed by the entire situation.
She noted, “Through the action, it's helped
me to realize that I can never morally go
back to the same old apathetic person I
was before doing Civil disobedience." She
continued, “As far as affecting the public.
its slow in growing, but it reaches out to
people,"

The reality of this statement will he seen
when, on Aug 9 of this year, a large
number of people are expected to turn out
for what Funaro calls “a big, well-
organized action" at the Strategic Air
Command base to once again protest
nuclear ar/nament.

‘I’ve never seen anything like this before’
Marmes V1olate policy
and spark protest

by Catherine Ingrassia

Four Marine Corps recruiting officers on
campus Wednesday met with a silent pro
test involving over 30 students in the
Forum, and found themselves in Violation
of the college recruiting policy, a Violation
which prompted their early departure.

According to William Deminoff, director
of college relations, the recruiters called
the college to get permission to come and
set up a recruitment table, The campus
operator transferred the call to the Forum,
where a Forum employee told the
recruiters they could come. The employee
was unaware of the college policy which
states that an unoccupied table with
literature on it is appropriate, but an oc-
cupied recruitment table in the Forum is
not allowed. The call should have been
referred to the Career Services Office,
with whom such arrangements must be
made.

Linda Johnsrud, the director of career
services, said that normally the recruiters
would have met individually wiﬂi students
at the Career Service Office on a sign up
basis. ”That’s why we have the pro
cedures, so that students can exercise
their rights to interview with the Marines
without such a public display. it doesn't
surprise me that there was this kind of
reaction, especially with this kind of
display,"

“The whole thing was just a case of
miscommunication,” said Deminoff. The
Career Services Office was apparently
unaware that the Marines were coming,
and the Marines were unaware of the col-
lege's policy. One officer declared, “We
didn't know we were against your policy
and we‘re sorry."

The Marine recruiters, headed by Major
lid. Wallace, arrived in the Forum at 9
amtoset up their display,l3y 12:3op.m,a
group of students had gathered in front of
their table'in silent protest.

Matt Adams, one of the instigators of
this demonstration felt that the Mai'ines'
“presence on campus implied a tacit ap~
proval of the military, We wanted to
register the feeling that we did not support
this tacit approval."

When the demonstration occurred, the
recruiters called the Office of College
Relations to see what should be done
When two of the officers met with
Deminoff and Johnsrud and realized that
they had violated college policy, the
recuriters agreed to leave.

 

Deminnff and Johnsrud accompanied
the two Marines back to the Forum where
Deminoft told the dwindling group of
students “We have not asked' the
recruiters to leave; they have chosen to
go.“ Johnsrud added, “They respected our
policy and our request that they discon-
tinue."

“They did not hesitate withdrawing for a
minute when they realized they were not in
keeping with college policy," Deminoff
later added. The recruiter's left the cams
pus by 1:45 pm.

Three of die Officers were not willing to
talk about the incident, and refused to
comment at all. Major Wallace said,
“They won't talk to me, why should I talk
to you? I have no comment.” Wallace and
two of his men even refused to give their
names. when asked where they were
from, one officer responded, “Why, we're
from the U.S. Marine Corps! "

Captain Roy H. Kemble. however,
agreed to discuss both the purpose of their
coming and the incident itself. Kemble
said that the objective of their visit was “to
let people know the kinds of officers’ proA
grams available."

Male students had been informed of such
programs through recent mailings from
the Marine Corps, Kemble knew that no,
recruiter had been to Grinnell in some
time, he saw no reason why Grinnell
students would not have an interest in
military programs. “Drake is a liberal
arts college, and they have students who
are actively involved fin military pro»
grams)." When asked how many Drake
students were actually involved, Kemble
replied, “About 10."

“We cover the whole state and I've
never seen anything like this before in my
life,” said an unidentified Marine. “Yes,”
added Kemble, “I have to admit l'm a lit
tle surprised. I haven't seen anything like
this since about 1972."

Kemble also felt that the whole incident
could have been avoided had the recruiters
been properly directed to the Career Ser-
vices office. “I regret that we were misin-
formed,” he said.

But the officer reiterated that the
Marines' early departure was prompted
purely by their unwitting violation of col-
lege policy and was in no way influenced
by “the demonstration." “We would have
stayed until 4 pm. even with this sort of

’ demonstration."

SGA election,

. attendance

rules tougher

by Nancy L. Radermecher

Proposals for changes in Joint Board
ielection and attendance procedure
highlighted discussion at this week's SGA
meeting,

Authored by Marilyn Zielinski, the first
motion was a rule to require the presence
of at least 20 percent of hall members in
order for hall elections to be considered
valid.

In the ensuing debate, SP&R Chairman
Richard Letchinger pointed out that the
bylaw “is mandating that people care."
He added that .18 does not have the right
“to legislate people's emotions,"

Zn favor of the proposal, Haines Hall
President Peter Hautzinger maintained
that “the basic intent is more than impor-
tant enough to justify the motion. Further»
more, he stated that a hall with less than a
20 percent turn out “does not have a right
to be represented,"

SRC chairman Eric Pedicini then noted
that students have “the right to vote and
the right not to vote."

Concluding the debate, an amendment
was added to the motion allowing for the
use of absentee ballots for off-campus elec-
toins. A hand vote was taken and the mo»
tion passed overwhelmingly.

The second proposal under discussion
was change in SGA bylaws limiting the
number or” absences permitted Joint Board
members. Currently a member may not be
absent more than five times per semester
or for three successsive meetings. The
bylaw change would limit members to one
unexcused absence and two excused
absences per semester.

Speaking {or the author of the bylaw,
Marilyn Zielinski, Social Coordinator
Allison Paich explained that the change
was necessary because hall represen-
tatives are not effective it they are not pres
sent at meetings often enough to follow
continuing debates and vote on important
issues. .

Also in favor of the bylaw change, Off-
Campus Non-College Owned Represen-
tative Michaelene’ Kelly pointed out that
the current policy is too lenient because
five absences per semester amounted to
approximately one-third of all SGA
meetings.

Debate soon ended, and the bylaw was
approved: In order to enact the new bylaw,
however, JB approval will also be required
at next week's meeting. '

In other business, SGA Treasurer'Vern
Juel reported that a new system has been
created to handle future telethon fundraisV
ing for the Student Activities Endowment,
Presently, SGA provides prizes for the
telethon in exchange for the use of the
Development Office‘s phone services.
Next year, however, the Joint Board will
renumerate the Office of Development
with 10 percent of the funds actually raised
at the telethon. He explained that the new
system would be more equitable for both
parties,
