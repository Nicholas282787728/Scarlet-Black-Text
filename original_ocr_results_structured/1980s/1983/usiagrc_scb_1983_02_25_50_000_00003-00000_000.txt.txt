 

A collection
of theatrical

images

Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 8 pm,
Arena Theatre

Traditionally, we drink of a play as a
story, including characters, a plot, a CriSIS
and a resolution. But this week's theatre
production, The Strindberg Play. is, accorv
ding to Assistant Director Jay Millen,
“less of a play than a collection of
theatrical images,” “The structure is not
at all like that of a conventional theatrical
piece, but almost like that of a musucal
work," added Director Sandy Moffet.

The Strindberg Play is loosely based on
The Stronger. a one-act dialogue by
August Strindberg. Strindberg was an im-
portant transitional playwright in the late
19th century. As both a realist and an ex-
pressionists, he bridged in many ways the
gap between traditional representative
playwrighting and the emerging ex:
pcrimental forms of the time.

Strindberg himself led a very unhappy
and lonely life since his early Childhood.
He was a cynical, bitter man and claimed
never to have observed a mutually
sastisfactory relationship between two
people. l-lis plays Center on themes such as
the conflicts between individuals,
competition in sexual relationships, the il:
lusions in which people trap themselves

in their original conception of the pro
duction, the ensemble intended to work
more or less directly from the text.
However, the play quickly evolved into a
very abstract representation embodying
many new concepts and ideas generated
during rehearsals by the cast and direc-
tors, as well as retaining most of Strind-
berg's basic themes. The production's
publicity posters were intended to reflect

Sweet Hours — (1982, 105 min.)

Sweet Hours, a multilevel fantasy set in
central Spain, is a film in which director
Carlos Saura explores his own past. The
hero Juan, a director, is obsessed wrth
memories of his early years: his mother,
his uncle, World War II and the Spanish
Civil War, even with the movie Gilda.

Saura. said to be Spain's most notable
recent director, juggles memory and con-
sciousness, comedy and social comment
much as he juggles time and setting, His
presentation is dominated by age-old pro
blems spotlighted and magnified by con»
temporary format and techniques.

Australian Film Series

My Brilliant Career — (1930)

My Brilliant Career is a beautiful lyric
film about a young woman's coming of age
in Australia in the early 19005. It is an
autobiographical film, and Judy Davis is
perfect as Sybylla, the uncommonly in:
telligent, highspirited but “plain-looking”
young girl, It is wonderful to watch her
grow through her struggle with the values
of the upper class, which insist that she
marry and care for a home.

For Sybylla, that is just not enough; she
wants to live, to experience. And she does,
There is not a lot of action, She falls in
love, is loved, and in a wonderfully human
portrayal, grows greatly through being the
governess for a large family living in the
Bush

This movie is warm, touching and
enriching. The cinematography is
beautiful and very moving. No matter
what else you do this weekend, see this
film. (Reprinted from the April 17, 1931,
S&Bl.

Caddie — (1976)

Set in 1925, Caddie is the story ofa young
Australian housewife who becomes fed up
with her marriage and her isolated life.
Acting on her dissatisfaction, she decides
to leave her husband and take her two
children with her to pursue a new life. Pen-
niless, Caddie (well played by Helen
Morse) is forced to work as a barmaid in
order to support herself and her “family"
The movie then proceeds to document her
adventures in a time when a single mother
is an anomaly.

Directed by Donald Crombie from Loan
Long's “Adaptation," Caddie is an err
joyable iilm and offers an interesting view
of life in 1920 Australia,

Breaker Moralit — (1981)

A visually beautiful and emotionally
powerful film, Breaker Moraiit documents
the lives of three soldiers who are court
martialed by the English government for
the murder of several civilians during the
Boer War.

The film examines such questions as the
hypocrisy of war and the clash between
political pressure and moral
rightA—issues which are as relevant to:
day as they were in the period represented
by the film. .

“At the heart a courtroom drama,"
Breaker Morant is notable for its superb
character development and its hard
hitting confrontation oi delicate issues, A
film not to be missed.
