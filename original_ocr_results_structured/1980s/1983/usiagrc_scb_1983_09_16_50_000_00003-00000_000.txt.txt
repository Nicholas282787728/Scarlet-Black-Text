Cures for the Midnight Munchies -_

Some Ingredients

l The third lull week at classes has come
|to a close and it you have not written a
Ipaper yet, doubtless you will have one soon
7 or perhaps an economics problem set,
maybe a little physics, surely a late night
Ibout with hurling, At any rate, sometime
around midnight (or earlier, on the ocean
Isions when “pepper steak”, “more
Icasserole", or some other culinary delight
Iwon’t suiiice for an evening) the “munr
Ichies" set in. Just as airspopped popcorn,
unsalted none the less, is beginning to taste
llike the paper wads you chew during class
to stay awake, and Peppercorn or hack
lAlley sandwmhes are getting to be a bit exs
Ipensive. help is here.

| Listed below are seven basic recipes to
|cure the midnight munchies They are
listed in order oi expense and time expen-
diture. The basic recipes here wereall
Imade for less than ten dollars, which IS a
lot of snacking ior a small price, (Ilyou’re
I
really in a bind, wear overalls to Quad). ii
lthe paper's due tomorrow, however, and
lyou are still procrastinating, no need to
lbegin now, You will more than likely be up

all night any way, and you will want
something to chew on for awhile. Head on
over to McNalley’s before closing time at
eleven and stock up,

pretty well)

honey and raisins, peanut butter (melted
with the margarine), parmesan cheese.
