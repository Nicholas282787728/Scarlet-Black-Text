The new volleyball coach, Barbara Ice,
is working with a team that lost 21 of 23
games last year. However, she is not
discouraged. “Sometimes when you come
to a place like this, a lot oi the people have
either never played or they‘re super unr
coordinated, But I'm very optimistic
they (this year’s team) have the [un-
damentals, they work as a team, and their
morale is high."

The volleyball team has the same pro-
blem as several others — an ineffective ol-
iense. In volleyball, this problem
translates into a lack of tall players able to
"spike" the ball over the net. “Our tallest
player is 57”. Due to the lack or height, we
must increase jumping ability," Ice said
she added, “II they just work together. I
can't say we will have a winning season,
but w.“ will definitelj improve."

Freeman described the sport as a tairly
casual affair. “Everybody who shows up
ior practice is on the team.” she said.

,“It’s hard ior them to realize when I tell
them that they will be able to run six or
seven miles .. but I can always guarantee
that they will be able to run six to seven hy
the end of the season without any physical
discomfort.“

Despite its informal attitude, the
women’s cross country team placed third
I“ the conterence last year. It placed se-
cond in two tournaments last year and
third in another.

There are 27 people out tor the team this
year, many who are veteran piayers,‘
Freeman said, ~~\\‘ith all of our people
back this year, we should finish in the top
three in the conierence."

Twentyrone runners do not constitute a
small men’s cross country team, so depth
should not be a problem, But Coach Ray
Obermiller said that although the Grinnell
men‘s team is larger than most it has
come up against the problem of “quality

Another factor hampering the team this
year has been the heat. “We ususally run
about eight miles a practice stopping at
times to concentrate on the quality at the
run But when it's 100 degrees at 4:30 in the
atternoon, you just can’t do that," said
Obermiller

To rid the team of these problems, Ober-
miller said that they have been “domg
more water training,” running in the
water, Obermlller said it is cooler, reduces
injuries, and could even be more produc-
tive than merely running.

“It develops your cardiovascular
system and muscles the same way running
does." Obermlller said. He also noted that
running in the water reduces stress on the
body. “People come in and think we're
Crazy whether or not it will beneﬁt the
team remains to be seen.”

Women now are competing tor severai
playing positions. One or these was
vacated by Lil Calhoun, the number one
tennis player last year and a strong player
for many years. “A number are fighting it
out tor positions right now, which i think is
a healthy way tor a team to be it makes
it fun,” said Hunter,
