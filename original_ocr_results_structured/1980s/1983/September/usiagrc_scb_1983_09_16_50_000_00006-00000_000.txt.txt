We hope everyone had an enjoyable time
at the movies this past weekend, if, for no
other reason. than to see a presPaul
Masson Orson Welles star in a film, often
acclaimed "the best of all time", which he
also directed. For Citizen Kalle, we have to
go thumbs way up: a film that has Welles a
slim character, which opposes our view ol
him today as three iunny iat people while
he is Sitting all by himseli,

This week, Hitchcock's Lifeboat stars
Tallulah Bankhead and Walter Slezak as
survivors of a torpedoed passenger ship
aboard a lifeboat. The cramped set is
merely this floating craft at sea. If you're
into U-Boats and Sir Alfred, this one may
be worth seeing.

Lost lel‘iloll is a work of another at the
great directors, Frank Capra. It‘s the
story oi iour people escaping irom an Ins
dian revolution who are captured and
taken to a Tibetan utopian community
where weather is kind and the people are
gentle and live to old ages. Come see this
and iind out how ShangrisLa became a
household word Stars Ronald Colman,
H.B. Warner and Sam Jaffe.

And tinally, this week's biggie is All That
Jalz.ali1m which stars Roy Scheider sup~
posedly simulating the lite of Bob Fosse,
who directed, wrote and had his hand in on
everything with this ihck Highlighting
this him are: the character played by
Jessma Lange, Scheidel"s unique way of
waking up in the morning, lots of slinky
dancers and dancmg, and a gruesome
anatomy lesson, For those oi you who want
to see how a big Broadway man lives, and
his innermost thoughts and feelings, we
suggest you go see this lilm, A deiinite

Last Year at Marienbad

One of the most Controversial works of
the French New Wave and winner ofa ma-
jor award at the Venice Film Festival,
Last Year at Marielibad, |S a surrealistic
portrait of a meeting between a man and a
woman at a baroque palatial hotel, The
man tries to convince the woman that they
have met before, “perhaps at
Marienbad.” He claims that at that first
meeting they planned to meet again to go
away together. Linear plot is ignored, and
time values are lcit vague From the open-
ing, in which the camera moves slowly
through the hotel's elegant corridors, the
film evokes a timeless locale in which the
protagonists seem to be trapped. Resnais
constructs a poetic time and space — dodg»
ing, skipping, doubling back, lingering,
and repeating

since time in the iilm has no objective
existence, the relationship oi the man and
the woman has the quality of a dream
Everything may have happened beiore, or
may be happening at the moment. or may
have happened Reality is equated with
possibility. The film is a closed ex-
perience In Maricnbad, Resnais stresses
subjective interpretations ot reality. The
ways in which people associate events in
their past with incidens in their present is
a recurring theme, In pursuing this theme,
the director contronts one oi the basic
dilemmas in the cinema: that of develop-
ing one’s creative ideas at the expense ol
cutting oneseli on irom the world oi come
mercial film, knowing that if a director
seeks a large audience, it will be at some
sacriiice to himseli

Vassar at Grinnell

by Lou Kersten

This Saturday, Vassar Clements and his
band will periorm at o p m. in Roberts
Theatre.

Clements, one of the premiere bluegrass
and swing iiddlers, has periormed with
such performers as Maybelle Carter, The
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, The Gratelul Dead,
Paul McCartney, and John Prine, before
going out on his own in 1973 “The Dirt
Band was important to my career," says
Vassar. “They’re the iirst ones who let me
play what l wanted to play "

Clements learned to play the iiddle when
he was seven years old on a Violin he found
at home. “l had to teach myself how to
play since there was no one around who
knew anything about the instrument,” He
got together with two cousins who were
also interested in playing music. This cols
laboration developed his musical timing
and prepared him to play with musicians
with ditlerent styles.

Primarily, his interest is in bluegrass.
Clements says, “It (bluegrass) was tlle on-
ly thing that could move a kid. There‘s just
something about it that got to me. There is
a lot of blues in it,"

In 1950 he made his first recording with
Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys, alter play
ing with Monroe's band a year earlier at
The Grand ole Opry "I remember telling
Mama i wanted to play The Grand Ole
Opi-y someday,“ says Vassar “But it was
iust a big joke way back then "

 

He gained national exposure when The
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band featured him on
their album, “Will the Circle Be
Unbroken.” Overnight he was recording
sessions with other artists, playing
everything irom bluegrass to jazz. Aiter
that, he was a solo actfor about a year, us-
ing backup bands on tours. In 1904, he
formed the Vassar Clements Band.

He emphasizes the importance or each
band member to the music creating pro-
cess. "The only thing we do is sit down and
learn the tune with each guy playing it the
way he wants to play it,” says Vassar,
“Each player puts his own ideas into it 7
it's the feelln' or the energy ofl' oi each

other, What I‘ve tried to do is to get pickers
who have the same outlook on music, peo
ple who want to learn together. My band
members come from all walks of music —
rock, jazz, bluegrass, country. This keeps
the sound fresh because as we learn, we all
play the music in our own way "

The Vassar Clements Band promises an
evening of down-home, damn good music.
This is an opportunity not to be missed,
particularly by those who need an in-
troduction to bluegrass.
