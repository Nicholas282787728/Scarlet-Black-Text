Avant-Garde
Cellist

In symphony orchestras and string
quartets, the cello carries the deep, gusty
melodies. Hundreds of Sonatas and cancer
tos have been written for this robust ins
strument, but until recently, the presence
of the cello has been void in jazz. David
Eyges is one of a handful of cellists Cur-
rently reiorming the instrument's status in
jazz circles, and Saturday evening at 3:30
p m, in South Lounge, he will bring his
music to Grinnell,

Cousin,

Jean~Charles Tacchella made three
lilms between 1975 and 197s, Voyage to
Grand Tartarie; Cousin. Cousine; and
Blue Country. while all bear
characteristics typical oi Tacchella‘s apr
proach oi lite and to tilmmaklng, only
Cousin. Cousine has achieved popular ace
claim,

Boﬂl Blue Country and Cousin, Cousiiie
are droll comedies in praise of liie. Tac-
chella is people-oriented, but he sees his
characters in a slightly out-ofethe ordinary
perspective, centering his action on
lovable characters, pleasure and enchant
ment, dreams and passions, and, oiten, on
giddy exhuherance. The result is a per
vading “glow” nowhere better to be
observed than in Cousin. Cousine.

Scarlet & Black

Eyges is a former rock guitarist who
became a classically trained cellist, and
has been a part oi the New York avant-
garde since he graduated from the
Manhatten School of Music in 1972. His
music is rooted in the blues tradition and
heavily influenced by Ornette Coleman
and Eric Dolphy.

Among the musicians performing with
Eyges is drummer Sunny Murray, whose
work with Cecil Taylor, Albert Ayler, and
John Coltrane established him as “ , the
most important innovator in contemr
porary percussion."

This trio has established itself as one of
the more unusual and exciting groups in
contemporary jazz, This Saturday's per
formance is a must for lovers of jazz and
innovative music,

Cousine

Both written and directed by Tacchella,
the iilm is the story of Marthe and
Ludovic, cousins through the marriage oi
his uncle and her mother, and their friend-
ship that blossoms into love.

Judith Crlst in the “Saturday Review"
said, “Cousin. Cousine is one of those rare
delights you want to see again and again, a
ieel-good movie that makes you like the
people on the screen 7 and yourself."

Vincent Canby in the “New York Times”
said, “An exceptionally winning, wittily
detailed comedy, Cousin. Cousiiie
possesses a heart that is light and
generous. A story with a twist, the iilm is
in the iinest tradition oi French comedy
love stories.”

SISKEL and EBERT

. by .
Jim and Billy

If you saw it, All That Jazz was just as
[astrpacet‘l and steamy as promised. it has
greatly changed our daily lives and, we'll
tell you, Dexedrine gets expensive,

This week features an even steamier
lilm, Body neat, written and directed by
Lawrence Kasdan. It stars Kathleen
Turner as Matty Walker, a woman trapped
in marriage to a rich man 20 years her
senior. she longs for some place dilierent
and more exciting and sees the Opportunl'
ty in William Hurt. She ﬁgures that she
can get i-lurt, driven by passion, to knock
oft her husband so that she can use the in-
surance money as airiare to the beach.

Hurt is at the center of this ﬁlm much as
he was in Altered States and Eyewitness.
We iollow his obsession and passion right
into the bedroom tor some very humid sex
scenes Body Heat has a 1940‘s feel to it,
you gotta like Bill Hurt, and hurrah [or sex
in the movtes. We go thumbs up.

Bill Hurt actually trained for the stage
and one of his roles at Circle Rep was
Hamlet. This weekend we can see
Laurence Olivier play the part, The 1948
Academy Awardrwinning version or
Shakespeare's Hamlet was also directed
by Sir Larry. The Prince spends a great
while before he decides to avenge his
father's death. There are some slow
moments when the camera pans around
the corridors, but fine acting and powertul
production make us go thumbs up, Other
stats include Peter Cushing (lately of Star
Wars lame) and Jean Simmons.

Does your eye doctor ever give you the
creeps? In slaughterhouse Five, you‘ll see
a suburban optometrist have nightmares
and fantasies about Nazi POW camps and
a futuristic planet. This anti-war fantasy.
based on a novel by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr
Stars Michael Sacks, Ron Leibman and
Valerie Perrine (of Superman).
