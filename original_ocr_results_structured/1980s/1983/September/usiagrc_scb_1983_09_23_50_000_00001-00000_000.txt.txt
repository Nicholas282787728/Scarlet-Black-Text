by Jane Kaufman

A man entered a student'ssouth Cams

Grinnell patrol officer, Dave Sears. Also
according to Sears, the man is thought to
be connected with the September 3
Younkers' incidents.

According to Resident Advisor Donna
Savage, in previous similar incidents, the
intruder only spoke to the students.
However, the man made physical contact
wth the students in this incident, according
to Anita Wollison, Resident Advisor.

“She fully awake when she realized that
his hand was on her leg. She asked him to
leave and he lei't," said Wollison. Wollison
also said that the student notiiied police
Saturday, gave a description of the ins
trader and was asked by police to identify
him through photographs,

“We‘re having some trouble getting the
students to identify him." stated Sears.
According to Sears, it was the “same guy

“We should seriously consider the
relative Value of core requirements weigh-
ed against the advantages and disadvanr
tages oi free choice.” These words, written
by college President George Drake in the
iall of 1981, mark the beginning at the cur;
rent Curriculum debate. Two years later,
distribution requirements have placed
“core curriculum’, but the main issues ap-
pear to remain much the same. in his 1981
and 1932 annual reports ‘in Griiinell
Magazine, Drake argues that because
Grinnell lacks general requirements, the
_ college cannot be certain that every Grin-
‘ nell graduate will receive a broad educa-

said " Sears emphasized the importance
of security saying that, “Carrying that key
is quite a bit more protection than they
[students] realize. They leave
everything wide open and they're asking
for problems,"

vice President and Dean of Student Af-
iairs James Tederman also mentioned the
importance of student responsibility in
security, '

“One thing we need from students is real
cooperation in not blocklng the loggia and
hall doors. . . If students don't take precau-
tions, we literally can‘t protect students
lrom themselves." said Tederman.

“None of these incidents have been
breakins. they [the intruders] have just
walked in."

in a related incident according to the
Grinnell Malcolm Magistrate Court, a
man was arrested Wednesday, Sept. 7, at
approximately 2 am. Subsequently, he ap~
peared in court and pled guilty to criminal
trespass charges for which he was Charged

“Many Vice-Presrdents have become
President from that position — I See [the
VicePresidencyl as an advantage and not
a disadvantage," [for Walter Mondale to

Presidential candidate Walter Mondale

gram or the Reagan Adminstraiion has
sapped money necessary for social pro-
grams.

Clark told students he isn't sure who will
win the Democratic nomination at next
August‘s Democratic National Convention
in San Francisco.

”It's fairly early to know if Mondale or
Glenn will gain the nomination," said
Clark. Clark didn't dismiss the possibility
oi a second~tier candidate's gaining the
nomination over either Mondale or Glenn,
and said that it would take another month
to determine lithe Democratic race is still
a two-man race.

IOWA SENATE RACE

Clark said Congressman Tom Harkin
(Dem.-Ia.) has the best Chance of anyone
in the nation to gain a Senate seat next
year, though he said Harkin will be out-
spent at least two to one by incumbent
Republican Senator Roger Jepsen

Clark considered running for the Senate
nomination but had opted instead [0 Sup'

“The basic reason was we Stood for the

him," said Clark. ‘

FOREIGN POLICY

Also, in response to several questions
about foreign policy, Clark said that
Americans have seen a deterioration of
foreign relations in all parts of the world
under the Reagan Administration. As ex-
amples of a foreign polic in disarray,

Hart hosts news editors in D.M.

by Brad Vander Linden

Democractic presidential hopeful
‘Senator Gary Hart of Colorado hosted coir
lege news editors from around the state
last Sunday at his Des Moines head-

quarters.

Hart quelled rumors that-his candidacy
is faltering because of legging campaign
contributions and said he felt that his cans
didacy is about to take-off He said his goal
is to raise one million dollars by the end of
the year, and that his campaign has
already reached the $350,000 mark,

Hart said he wasn't sure his efiort for the
Democratic Nomination would gain
ground at the expense of Senator Alan
Cranston‘s peace campaign, after the
Soviet downing of Flight 007.

“It‘s awfully hard to tell 7 if they
[Cranston supporters] believe there is no
difference between the Russians and the

US, then i think it [the downing oi KAL
#007] has,H said Hart.

Hart added that he didn't play off other
Democratic candidates strategies. “I just
set my course and ii rm right, ['11 be
President "

Hart, further said he found no "chain of
reasoning" from the A4007 incident to sup- 7
port the Reagan Administration in
building the MX missile.

Just back from a facHinding tour of

Central America, Hart said the problems:
of El Salvador are casued more by “pover-

ty than ideology," Hart stressed that the

Us should freeze aid to Honduras at cur

rent levels and end support of right-wing

somosticas staging border raids into

Nicaragua. Hart added that die wary to

remove the causes of revolution is Hiro'ttgh

tion, but that under our advising system
most students achieve this goal. He notes
that the students are opposed to change.
preferring the freedom to choose, He
believes that there are some advantages to
this freedom. “Education is usually more
effective with volunteers than conscripts "

In the autumn of 1983, the main issues
appear to be: 1) What is a liberal educa»
lion? 2) Are students at Grinnell receiving
a liberal education? and 3) Does the cur»
rent situation at Grinnell merit a change
from a nonsrequirement to a requirement
system? Grinnell professors appear reluc-
tant to define liberal education. In inter-

views conducted last week, two senior
laculty members, one opposed and one in
favor of the Parslow proposal, discussed
these issues.

Professor of History Philip L. Kintner
said that he wished that he did have a
definition oi liberal education He'said that
he could precisely deﬁne a fifteenth cens
tury liberal education, but that in these
times of rapid change, ”what would fill the
requirement oi a liberal education in one
decade would have to be reconsidered in
the next," Kintner described the qualities
in a pcrsonpursuing a_li,b_eral_education “I
suppose it involves'an‘in’quiring 'min

which reaches across a wide variety of
disciplines and tries to integrate
knowledge. 1 think it lliberal education]
tries to create an individual who is able to
respond to a very wide variety of problems
and situations,” he added.

When asked how he derided liberal
education, professor of biology Kenneth
Christiansen responded, "I don't.” He
related how a committee had once spent
two years defining it, only to have the
president at that time and the majority of
the faculty reject the definition. He said
that we can give characteristics of a
