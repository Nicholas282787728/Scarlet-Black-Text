The Grinnell Varsity Soccer Team kick-
ed oii its season this past Saturday against
favored Carleton. A fantastic first half for
the Pioneers, iollowed by a rainstorm.
highlighted the game

The game started about a half an hour
late under grey skies, The game was
played at mid-iield ior much oi the first
twenty minutes; neither Grinnell noi-
Carleton ever threatened to score.

Then, in the rest oi the iirst hali, Grin
nell established its dominance with a
seemingly legal goal by Chris Caris, Cal-is
was in position at mid-field for a John
Gerry cross kick. “I had seen Johnny 30
yards back. when the pass came to melt
was just over my head. so I had to slap it. I
was hoping that they treierees) wouldn't
see it; I acted as if it was a goal." said
Caris.

Although the referee Closest to the goal
did not notice the hand ball, angry
Carleton players and the other reierees
noticed the hand ball foul The goal was
disallowed.

The first Grinnell goal came off a penalr
ty kick Dave Rix faked the kick and Tom
Elssenbei‘g lofted the ball over the crotch

strong Grinnell had been substituting
regularly during the game, especially in
the front line. in contrast, Carleton made
only a couple of substitutions. Because of
the high humidity, conditioning became a
iactor during the first halt. but did not play
a signiiicant role in the second because oi
the rainstorm.

Greg Donovan, goalie for the Pioneers,
commenting on the conditioning oi the
Grinnell players, said, "We had practiced
two weeks betore the game and Carleton
had practiced only a week,"

Grinnell's second goal came off a Tom
Eissenberg assist to Brian Liptzin. Tom
Eissenberg lofted a perfect indirect kick to
an undefended Liptzin who headed the ball
in for a score about four minutes belore
half.

directly and fell into the net Although
Donovan admitted that the rain and the
muddy field played a factor in Carleton‘s

Probably the most exciting moment ot
the game came when Donovan, trying to

Carleton player then kicked thc ball
