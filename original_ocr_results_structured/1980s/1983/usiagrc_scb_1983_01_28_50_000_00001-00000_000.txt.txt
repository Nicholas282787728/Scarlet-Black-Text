Student guilty

of check
forgery

by Kim MacDonald
A college student accused of forging

signatures on another student's stolen
checks was found guilty of theit in a
Judicial Council hearing Dec, it Presi-
dent George Drake approved the council's
recommendation that the student be plac»
ed on conduct probation tor the remainder
or his tenure as a student at Grinnell. The
case is also being heard in Civil court.

Although it was an open hearing, the
8&8 did not attend, and Judicial Council
members did not disclose the name or the
defendant,

Dean oi student Affairs Jim Tederrnan,

a member oi the Judicial Council, brought
charges against the defendant. Tederman
explained, "The student had been under
suspicion by local police and voluntarily
turned himselt in " immediate restitution
was made by the detendant to the student
, whose checks had been stolen and cashed.

The dean noted that there were four
other incidents of check forgery on cam~
pus last semester. Thieves cashed stolen
checks at local banks for amounts ranging
from $40 to $200. The rash of theft promp»
ted the administration to place a warning
in the “Campus Memo " advising students
at the danger oi leaving their rooms
unlocked,

Tederman noted that the defendant was
only involved in one incident of checkbook
theft although he forged more than one
check.

Although theft is a serious crime,
punishable by suspension or dismissal,
Rick Richardson, chairperson of the coun-
cil, noted that the group recommended
conduct probation because they were “im-
pressed by the detendant's attitude,” Aer
cording to Richardson, the student “realize
ed the consequences" of his actions and
was sorry. The defendant “realized he was
wrong," Richardson concluded.

“In a big school the student may have
been kicked out” for a similar crime,
Richardson claimed, but because of the
student's attitude, the council decided to
“give the student a second chance."

The charge was received by Richardson
Dec, 5, and the'trial was scheduled before
the end of the semester because the coun~
cil attempts to get “things done as quickly
as possible,” according to Richardson,
Both Tedermari and Richardson also noted
that the hearing was held before winter
break because of the possibility that the
defendant might be suspended or dismiss
ed.

Students in van crash
Hazardous conditions cause crash

by ieii Raymond

For the second time this year, a Grinnell
College van crashed while transporting
students for a college event. This time, a
van carrying six members or the women's
swim team and Coach Martha Rowedder
back from a training session in Ft. Lauder-
daie, i-‘la., was totaled in southern Georgia
on Thursday, Jan. 20. ,

There were no serious injuries in the
mishap, which occurred in Unadilla, 6a., a
town approximately 40 miles south or
Macon. Those in the van at the time of the
crash were: Sarah Alter, Penny Bates, Sue
Helgeson, Janice Mineah, Meg Philpott,
Laura Sinai and Rowedder, The team re-
quested that the driver of the van remain
anonymous to avoid embarrassment and
harassment.

“Just some bumps and bruises, said
Rowedder of the minor injuries suiiered in
the accident “We were really lucky no one
got more seriously injured,”

The van hit a patch of ice on a bridge,
spun around and flipped on its side, "It
could have happened to anybody," said the
driver oi the van,

The driver, along with all other students
who had driven on the trip. had been given
clearance to drive by the school, in accor-
dance with the policy instated atter a van
carrying students to a retreat crashed ear~

 

ly last semester. That van was also driven
by a student.

The new policy states that all drivers
must have a valid license, no violations in
the past three years and must have attend»
ed a short training program given by
drivers employed by Buildings and
Grounds. ,

Rowedder stated that the team had
heard reports ct hazardous driving condi-
tions and possible ice storms, but was not
iully prepared for what happened. “It
didn't give us time to think about it,“ she
explained. “It just happened."

The college was notified shortly after the
crash and two 5er workers were dispat~
ched in a van rented from a local auto
dealer to pick up the team members The
men left Friday morning, but poor road
conditions held up their arrival in Unadilla
until noon Saturday. The team members
stayed in a motel until then and arrived
back in Grinnell Sunday,

Waldo Walker, executive vice-president
oi the college, said that the bill for housing
and returning the crash Victims would
come to between “$001,500, He said that
the college's insurance would cover the
cost of replacing the van. because the
driver was not liable for the accident. “It
has not been reported to me that the driver
is at fault," he stated.

Concerts for

wmner S

by Jeff Raymond
The top four money»making teams at
this semester's telethon will get the chance
to see a popular musical act in concert, ac-
cording to Chris Murner of the Telethon
Committee Tickets to the Diana Ross con-
cert have already been purchased, and
other possible groups include Rail and
Gates, Neil Young, Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers and the Stray Cats.

Organizers oi the telethon say that this
effort will be similar to the fall telethon, in
which the top team went to Vail, Colo,
over winter break. The winning team was
comprised of Peter Beaten, David Nelson,
Lynette lckes, Karen Rose and Barb
Lucas.

There will again be 20 four-person teams
allowed to compete in the telethon, which
begins Feb, 13 and runs through the 19th.
Six of the teams will receive prizes, with
the top four teams going to concerts. The
next two teams will receive dinners at an
area restaurant.

Murner said that this telethon will serve
as a kind or “mop~up operation" to com-
plement the tall telethon. Those people
who contributed in the fall will not be ask»
ed to give again, but those people who were
not melted or who generally donate in the
spring will be called. New contributors will
also be contacted.

Amy Wolff and Scott Ross also serve on
the committee. Campus represenlatives
for the upcoming telethon are Nelson,
Scott Hildula and Paula Dimino.

According to Murner, “The spring
telethon has traditionally not been as suc-
cessful" as the {all telethon. Ross said that
the committee's goal is to raise half as
much as the fall telethon, which raised
around $00,000, '

The money raised through the telethon
will help to pay the operating expenses of
the college and financial aid. Ross and
Murner emphasized the importance of the
money raised because it helps delray the
difference between the actual cost of one
year at the college and the cost paid by
each student. Figures released by the col-
lege administration show that each stu-
dent actualiy pays only tworthirds oi the
total bill for one year of school.

The money raised in donations from the
classes of '30, '81 and '82 will go to the SGA
Activity Endowment Fund for use directly
by students.

Funds for the various prizes are ex-
pected to come from the SGA, as they have
in the past, and phones and alumni inforr
mation will be provided by the college.

Sign-ups for the telethon begin Monday
morning and will continue through
Wednesday, All those interested are urged
to contact Deb Ross in the Development
Office at extension 2130 All those who pal»
ticipate will receive complimentary kites
[or their efforts, Each team will put in four
to five hours of work during the telethon

Orientation sessions for the telethon will
be held in the Pub Feb. 10 and 121Free
beer and soda will be prOVided for those
planning to work on the telethon
