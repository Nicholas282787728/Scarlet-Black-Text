X at Grinnell

Feminist discusses rape

by Ellen Piekalkiewicz

“We must be able to choose not only the
person, but when, where, and, how we
l women] will have sex.” said Laura X, one
or the country's leading authonties on the
controversial issue of date and marital
rape and Executive Director of the Na-
tional Clearinghouse on Marital Rape. She
discussed these Issues In an Interview
Tuesday morning

Rape in marriage was the topic or a lens
ture given by Laura K to the liuman Rela~
tions and Education class Tuesday after
noon at Grinnell College, She explained to
the class that rape is an act at violence. not
sex, and can take place within a marriage
or dating situation

In the interview Laura X warned that
“date rape has reached epidemic propon
tions on college campuses "

She explained that In a dating situation
the man regards the ”woman as his pro-
perty. just as in a marriage," and that he
thinks that “she owes it [sex] to him."

Date rape is rarely heard about, she
said, because “the woman is so humiliated
ior ever trusting the guy that she remains
silent."

Laura X admitted‘that she gets accused
of exaggerating the s' uation and of being
labeled a “hypertemi 'st,"

However, she points to the many recent
articles concerning date and marital rape
in women’s magazines such as Ms“
Glamour. and Mademoiselle She said that
these magazines, run mostly by men, but
printing these articles, are a “statement in
itself that these things [date/marital rapel
are being taken seriously.”

At the beginning of her lecture, Laura X
played a videotaped segment or "Up to
the Minute", a television program on
which she has appeared. The program
began with the testimonies of two women
who were raped by their husbands One oi
the women said. “Rape by a husband is in
fact worse than being raped by astranger.
because a husband is someone with whom
you supposedly have a loving and trusting
relationship,“

Both oi the women wanted to press,

charges against their husbands, The lirst
woman, however, was from Pennsylvania,
one or the many states where the crime oi
rape exists only outside oi marriage. She

said that our society still believes that "a'

man‘s home is his kingdom in which the
woman is a servant." She said many men
believe a "husband has the right to do
what he wants to in his own house,"

The second woman on the show was
from California. where marital rape is
punishable under state law. She accused
her husband or rape He was later pron
secuted and received a or on sentence.

Laura X remarked that California is one
of ten states In which “women are cons
sidered human beings "

In other states, a "husband can force his
wife to have sex with him and get away
with it," Laura X said She added that In
those states “women have no rights, even
to their own bodies,"

in many oi those states, rape in mar-
ridge is considered merely assault which
is usually treated as a misdemeanor
Laura K considers it an offense to all
women that rape is reierred to as only
assault. “Why should it be made a lesser
crime that it actually is?" she asked, She
then added, ”Why should women have to
Suffer?"

Laura x attributed women's suiiermg to
the fact that we live in a male dominated
society and “men know they can and do
get away with rape." she added, "Many
men do not believe there is rape at all.”

Laura x dropped her last name as a pro-
test against the fact that even women's
names are not their own, but are their
fathers or husband’s. Laura X has been
active in the women's movement Since
1967. She was the cerfounder of this -nun-
try's first Women's Liberation Movement
newspaper.

In 1968, she began working to set up the
Women's History Research Center in
Berkeley, Calif, of which she is now direc-
tor. The Center is working to return to
women not only history that has never
been taught, but also the history that they
, are in theprocess of making

The iaculty made little progress Monday
in the opening debate over the Parslow
Proposal on curricular rerorm Financial
issues. advising versus requirements
issues, and the science lab requirement
dominated the discussion

Considerable time was spent discussing
the iinancial ramiiications oi the proposed
distribution requirements, despite ad-
ministrative requests that such issues
should not dominate the discussion,

President George Drake said, in
response to questions, that due to the
decline in enrollment enlarging the iacuity
was not a likely alternative, He said that
any changes in the distribution or courses
would have to be covered by changing the
contiguration oi courses taught by each
professor and, in the long term, by
redistributing faculty positions.

Chairman oi the Faculty and Proiessor
oi Religious Studies Dennis Haas pointed
out that, in fact, the iacuity would effec-
tively be smaller due to the policy oi

, replacing rower iaculty sabbaticals. . , ,

Professor of Russian John Mohan said
that the college's present circumstances
were not favorable for change. “When in
stitutions of higher learning significantly
alter themselves in a period oi uncertainty
in the demographic picture, they oiten go
under "

In response to questions concerning the
eiiect oi adopting the proposal on the ap
plicant pool, Director oi Admissions John
Hopkins said that some students are at-
tracted by the "stylistic diliercncc" oi
Grinnell's open curriculum, and that Grin-
Hell is hampered by a lack oi other selling
points, such as location Hopkins said,"It's
simple thinking to believe that by
changing the curriculum we are certainly
going to attract more disciplined students
to Grinnell. I don't see that happening “
He added that in recent years the admis-
sions staff has not portrayed Grinnell as
“a freebie school", but rather has stress-
cd "muscular advising" to perspectives

A memorandum to the iaculty irorn ProA
[essor oi Anthi‘oplogy Ronald Kurtz spark-
ed further debate, Kui‘tz called on the
faculty “to reject the Parslow Proposal,

Faculty members at last Monday’s meeting.

Grinnell College's offering In the nation's
backstosbaslcs movement in education, If
It [liberal educationl Involves students
having the ireedom to choose, and in rain
tional dialogue with mentors work out iris
dividual programs oi education ior
themselves. then our present system is
more than adequate "

Professor of Chemistry Luther Erickson
took an opposing view He cited a report
which blamed the decline in preparedness
of high school students. at least in part, on
the lack or general requirements in secon-
dary education. He called for a clear state-
ment to students and the outside world of
what Grinnell requires to complete a
Bachelor or Arts degree

Several professors reiterated Erickson's
view concerning requirements. Professor
of Economics Robert Voertman argued
that compulsion is already a part or the
educational system. He said, “I'm hot worn
ried about the damage to free choice and
liberty . , this is not a place where liberty
controls. Professor of Economics John
Dawson said he viewed the proposal as
“the rationalization" of what the advising
system tries to do,

Professor of Religious Studies Howard
Burkle opposed requirements. He argued
that the advantage oi having only in-
terested students in classes and the desire
ior completeness which requirements ad
dress may be mutually exclusive He said
he was notsure that it was worth giving up
the former for the latter,

in general those who supported re-
quirements argued tor a clear statement
or purpose, while those who opposed them
argued that a change in requirements
without a change oi curriculum content
was not worth the loss of freedom and flex-
ibiiity which the present system allows.

Further discussion centered around the
lab component oi the science requirement.
The lab debate began with questions from
the Social Science Division concerning the
neceSSIty of labs The Science Division
responded that lab \voi'k was essential to
the understanding or science protessor oi
Biology Karl DeLong disagreed with other
division members on the issue

Professor Mohan raised the Issue of the
