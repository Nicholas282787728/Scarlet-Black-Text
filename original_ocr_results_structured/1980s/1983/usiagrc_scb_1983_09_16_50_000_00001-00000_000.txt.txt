Moyer Speaks on KAL 007

by Owen Charles

Associate Professor of Political Science
Wayne Moyer gave a talk last Tuesday
night in South Lounge to the Grinnell Cola
lege Freeze and Dlsai‘m tocusing on the
peace movement atter the Soviet downing
of a South Korean Airliner,

Meyer said the Soviets had no right to
shoot down KAL 007 because they had S|gﬂ'
ed agreements to provide safe conduct tor
all civil alrci‘alt under international law
Mayer locused on where the blame for the
incident might lie — whether the order to
ﬁre on the unarmed plane was given by
local ground control, regional or national
military headquarters, or the political
leadership.

Moyer suggested it was probably a
regional or national military command
deciswn. but added that the risk was too
great for Soviet generals to take withoutat
least intorming civilian leadership. Meyer
said that the lying by the Soviet spokespers
sons was due to the “secretiveness of
Soviet society,” and that probably they lat

a quick response.

The refusal to acknowledge responsibili-
ty was also a result or insecurity on the
part or the Soviet leadership Moyer
asserted that the SDVlel. leadership has
always leared that admission ora mistake
would reflect either fallibility or a
challenge to authority.

Moyer concluded by assessing the
Reagan Administration’s response and the

possible impact of us. policy decisions
Moyer said that the Reagan Administra-
tion is acting with restraint and that SanCr
tions like the gram embargo have proved a
"dismal iailure" in the past.

Meyer said the Reagan Administration
assumed that Andropov either gave or
knew of the order, and the decismn to fire
on [light 007 was just another example of
the moral bankruptcy of an "evil empire "

"The Administration is oversreacting in
saying this is the prooi or the pudding,"
said Moyer.

But he added “the Reagan Administra-
tion is acting brilliantly in channelling his
outrage into support for his weapons

' which may actually decrease our

Moyer also said that us. Senator Alan

Curricular
Changes

Proposed

by Iim Hunter

New requirements tor graduation trom
Grinnell College were proposed in a
"Report to the Faculty." This report, Writ'
ten by Morris Parslow, Professor oi
French, was distributed this week to
students by the Student Government
Association. The proposed requirements
include-

4 credits oi Freshman Tutorial

4 credits oi designated problem solving

Competency in a roreign language
(lZscredits, negotiable)

8 credits of laboratory seience

8 credits of social science

8 credits of humanities (a choice from a
limited number of options)

A discussion of the proposal will take
place at a meeting oi the iaculty on
September 25

in the report, Parslow stressed a
number of points about the college curs
ricuium, He stated that the faculty, while
in agreement that Grinnell College should
provide a liberaleducation, doesn’t appear
to agree on a detinition oi the term “liberal
arts". He concluded, “In sum, we can
deliberate more protitably about means
than about ends."

The questions which the report seeks to
answer are. Does Grinnell’s curriculum
retorm insure more “completeness and
coherence,” or “an acceptable ratio" or
“breadth and depth"?

Parslow said that the iaculty is not likely
to accept any proposal which would
signihcantly disrupt the existing allocas
[ion of Staff or configuration Oi depart»
ments, and concludes that change can only
be made incrementally.

The report cited a number or iigures cons
cerning the courses taken by the class or
less. while these tigures can be inter-
preted in a number olways, they appear to
show that, while there is room tor im-
provement, the large majority oi students
receive a fairly broad liberal education at
Grinnell (depending, of course, on how one
chooses to deline liberal education).

Attached to the Original report were live .
appendices, which did not appear in the
student copies of the proposal, Among
these appendices were an article by Steven
M. Cahn, Of the Rockefeller Foundation,
defining liberal edcuation as education for
successful democracy and calling for a
return to requirements, and an article
critlclzmg science courses for non-science
majors

Copies or the unabridged report are
available at Burling Library under the
heading “curriculum."

According to Dean of Faculty Catherine
Frazer, the September 26 meeting will be
tor discussion only, and no action will be
taken. A laculty vote on the proposal is ex
pected by the end of the semester,

Registration and Financial Aid

by Ken Scotton

This summer as usual Grinnell College
Students on ﬁnancial aid received their
statement of educational purpose forms to
sign, This year, however, the forms includ-
ed a new item. Students had to certify that
they were either registered with the Selec-
tive Service, or not required to,

The Change in the affidavit is a result of
the Solomon amendment which was pass-
ed by Congress a year ago and went into el-
i'ect this summer, The new law requires
the withholding of all government finan-
cial aid to male college students who
haven’t complied with draft registration.
The amendment was introduced into Con-
gress by Representative Gerald Solomon
of New York who is now also -roposing

measures that would deny food stamps,
housing loans and passports to young men
who tail to register,

“The message is Simple: No registrar
tion, no money,” says Secretary of
Education T.H. Bell.

“We’re hoping this will dramatically
raise the rate or registration," said Gary
Holmes, Rep, Solomon's Executive Assise
tent, “Once (non-registrants) realize the
government is serious and that they may
suiter penalties tor their civil disobe»
dience, they may decide it is not really im»
portant for them to take this stand,” he
said,

The law states that all male U.S. citizens
and most noncitizens in the U. . must

register tor the drait within 30 days or their
eighteenth birthday.

Nationwide, this law aliects about 2.5
million male students who receive
Guaranteed Student Loans, Pell Grants,
worksstudy assistance and other Title iv
financial aid, At Grinneli, this includes
about 300 students

The Solomon amendment was challeng-
ed last spring by the University oi Mine
nesota and Macalaster College tollowing
the introduction or a suit by the Minnesota
Public interest Research Group. (The suit
said the amendment preached constitu.
tional rights in a number of ways. First, it
violated the litth amendment, which pro»
tects against seli—incrimination; also the

law has deemed a bill olattainer, in that it
intlicts punishment without due process
Finally, the court also determined the
amendment discriminated On the basis of
sex, age, income. and race.)

The U.S. District Court for the District of
Minnesota ruled in favor of the suit.
However, the U.S. Supreme Court over-
turned the ruling and stated that the
Solomon Amendment was to remain in el-
iect while it reviewed the case. A decision
is expected by the beginning at next year

Director of Admissions and Students
Financial Aid John Hopkins said that the
government is “identiiying only a segment
or the college population that is male
