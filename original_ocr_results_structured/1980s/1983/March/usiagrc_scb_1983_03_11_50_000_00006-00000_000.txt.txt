Lawrence, 28 each; Monmouth, 27; Beloit,
13; and Knox. six. “I was very pleased,"
said Coach Will Freeman. “We had some
outswnding efforts.”

Mike McCrary authored a Grinnell stan-
dard of 06.34 in the semifinal heat of the
60-yard dash and went on to win the event
with an 06.5 race in the finals.

Tennis team revs up for season

by Mark Cloud

What Grinnell athletic team consisits of
more than three intelligent team
members, requires a ball for its sport, and
has the distinguished privilege of being
directed by the coaching prowess of Ed
Dombrowski? “Why, the football team, of
course," you say. Wrong, everyone knows
that the football team does not have more
than three... no, i won't go into that. lam
referring, instead, to the men's tennis
team.

The men began their spring season last
week at home, with a pair of wins and a
single loss. The wins came over William
Penn College and Wartburg College, by
identical scores of 7:2. The loss was at the
hands of the University of Northern fowa,
with a score of 3-0, in what team member
Eric Eldsmoe termed a “learning ex:
perience."

The team hopes that this season will not
be a string of ”learning experiences" for
the Pioneers, who lost two valuable
members from last year’s team. The
Pioneers lost Rich Catrambone, who
graduated, and Chuck Adkins, who is stu:
dying in Spain this semester The loss of
Catrambone is the teams‘s biggest pro7
blem this year. Catrambone consistently
dominated the number one position on the
Pioneer roster for the last four years and
was consistently one of the top singles
players in the Midwest Conference for four
years.

This year’s team members, however,
think they can overcome Catrambone's
absence and have a successful season.

perience' and maturation of the players
since last season7 should outweigh the
detriment of having lost a star. According
to team captian Derek Vroom, “We can be
pretty good this year, even though we lost
Rich (Catrambone). We’ve got five of last
year’s top eight players retuning. So the
nucleus of the team is experienced.” The
five returning lettermen include:
Eidsmoe, Vroom, Dan Silversmith, Mark
Cloud and Peter Kupferburg. Add to that
list junior Joe Neri, who lettered his
freshman year but did not play last year
and you have a solid team. If early season
results are any indication, a successful
team.

The wins over William Penn and Wart:
burg were definitely morale boosts for the
team. But the biggest boost of all may
have come last fall when the Pioneers

. traveled to Des Moines where they

defeated Drake University, “Yeah, that
definitely did the team a lot of good. It
makes us realize that we can be com-
petitive with almost any team we play,“
Said Silversmith.

The men do not play at home again until
after spring break, After break they will
begin conference play in preparation for
the seasonrending conference tournament.
So if you want to see some good tennis, just
stop by the Tenth Avenue Courts this spr-
ing. According to Nerf, “It's great for us to
have fans there watching. And I think the
fans will enjoy it too. We play good tennis,
and besides that we wear tight shorts."
Now that’s good incentive to support the
Pioneers, who will be giving their ops
ponents a "learning experience."

 

 

Swim Team

This was supposed to be a rebuilding
year for the Grinnell College men’s swim-
ming team.

Graduation had claimed most of the
stars who had led the Pioneers to four con-
secutive Midwest conference crowns, and
several loop clubs had Visions of ending the
Grinnell reign.

But nobody told Coach Ray Obermiller
and his Pioneers, or they refused to believe
it.

Building a new powerhouse that
featured a blend of returning letter-
winners and talented newcomers, Ober-
miller led the Scarlet and Black to their
fifth championship in a row at the 1983 loop
meet held last Thursday, Friday and
Saturday at Grinnell's Physical Education
Complex pool.

Making a shamble of what was expected
to be a Close meet, Grinnell piled up 50602
points and finished more than 200 paints
ahead of second place Carleton.

Carleton had 279 points and was followed
by: Chicago, 234%: Knox, 224; Lake
Forest, 192; Coe, 172; Belmt, 134; Ripon,
117; Cornell, 4c, and Lawrence, 27.

The Pioneers forged a 357p0int lead the
first day and increased it to 173% points
after day two.

“It was one of the best team perfor-
mances we’ve ever had at a conference
meet,“ a jubilant Obermiller said. “The
men performed far beyond my expecta:
tions. Just about everyone posted his
fastest times of the season and many had
career bests."

Eighteen of the 19 Pioneer at the meet
cunn‘ibuted points toward the victory
total.

Continuing a long tradition of outstan-
ding Grinnell freestyle sprinters, Rob
Rollins was involved in all five of the
events the Pioneers won.

He captured the 50-yard, 1007yard and
ZWyard freestyle races and anchored the
Victorious 4007yard freestyle and EDD-yard
freestyle relay units. He also anchored the
second place duo-yard medley foursome.

Rollins was joined on the Winning
freestyle teams by Hugh Deaner, steve
Block, and Dave Grapey His older
brother, Bruce Rollins, was a conference

champion freestyler for Grinnell in the
late 1960‘s.

loo-yard butterfly, loo-yard breaststroke
and ZOO-yard breaststroke and four men in
the oooyard individual medley, 50-yard
freestyle, zoo-yard individual medley,
