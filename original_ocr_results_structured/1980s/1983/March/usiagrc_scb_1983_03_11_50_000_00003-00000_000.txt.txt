IlOtES

musxc ranks as some or the hardest funk to
appear in recent memory. The group's
sound is like an instrumental version of
Farliament/Funkadeli but with an offbeat
twist: harmelodics.

i-iarmelodics is the theory oi jazzman
Ornett Coleman that allows musicians to
move ireely in and out or diiierent keys.
But the overriding feature of Cosmetic is
the beat — hard, danceable and funky,

According to Musician Magazine.
“Jamaaladeen's firm, definite bass lines
surround his hands more rudimentary
shadings with stomping, shiiting angulari»
ty,” Other members of Cosmetic are
guitarist Jim Murphy and saxophonist

. James Watkins.

, Coming to Grinnel] > direct from their
hometown, Philadelphia, this band is now
on its first national tour. This is a rare op-
portunity to see Cosmetic out of the New
York/Philadelphia area, so don't miss it.

Day of the Locust — (1975, 140 min.)

An adapation oi Nathaniel West’s novel,
Day oi the Locust portrays an aesthete's
view of Los Angeles society in the 19305 in
which the culturally-debased people of the
city bring on the apocalypse. To West, the
retired people who ﬂock to LA. ior the
sunshine and oranges are savage and bit-
ter because they “haven’t Hie mental
equipment ior leisure, the money nor the
physical equipment ior pleasure.”
Similarly, those who have gone west in
pursuit of fame and iortune are depicted.
as the poor in spirit who bought the comr
mercial dreams of Hollywood,

Expert performances by Burgess
Meredith as a washed-up vaudevillian sell-
ing dreams does much to enhance the
credibility of the film, William Atherton is
also superb in his debut as an “impress
sionable, civilized, young Yale screen-
writer trying to cope and succeed in
Hollywood.”

Despite these fine pcriormances,
however, Day oi the Locust suiiers irom a
lack of depth in its character development,
which serves to make this already long
film seem even longer. The iilm does
manage, though, to iaithiully depict the

horrible emptiness of Hollywood as it is so

vividly portrayed in the book.

Holiday — (1938, 100 min.)

“In the '305," wrote Pauline Kael of The
New Yorker. “Kamarine,Hepburn’s wit
and nonconformity made ordinary
heroines seem mushy, and her angular
beauty made the round-faced ingenues
look piggy and stupid.” This week's iilm
Holiday spotlights Hepburn in such an ar—
chetypal role as a rich, “highsociety”
tomboy who falls in love with her sister‘s
ﬁance (Cary Grant). She soon perceives
that her overbearing and obnoxious
parents are attempting to run his liic
which, in turn, prompts him to take a
“holiday" in order to reexamine his
Values. A

A graceful film version of a Broadway
hit, Holiday is an entertaining and
sophisticated comedy that “has plenty oi
class.”

on the Beach — (19513, 133 min.)

Shown in conjunction with the Freeze
and Disarm, 1nc., iilm series, On the
Beach confronts the possibility of the total .
destruction of mankind due to nuclear irr
responsibility.

Tipped bit by a strange radio signal
emanating from Southern California, 0n
the Beach documents a harried U.S. Navy
submarine journey en route to San Diego
in an effort to discover the source oi the
signal. The ensuing adventure is suspense-
filled and frightening. Especially notable
is a spinertingling but wordless scene of a
sailor walking alone on the ship’s deck.

'The haunting Austrian folk song, “WaltzV

ing Matilda," which recurs throughout the
film, effectively caps oil the tension and
fear which characterizes the sailor‘s ill-
iated quest.

Alongside this somewhat maudlin plot is
a love story involving the film’s leading acV
tors Greogry Peck and Ava Gardner. The
sharp contrast between the sensitivity oi
their relationship and the brutality of
nuclear armament serves to enhance this
film's message. .

The film’s slogan, meant to apply to its
fictitious 1964 nuclear holocaust is, “We
don't have too much time, brother." The
truth or mis statement is more apparent
today than over, which is, in itseli, a good
reason not to miss Oil the Beach this
weekend.
