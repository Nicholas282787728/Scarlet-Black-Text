what were your first impressions of
Grinnell‘?

Beth Verston: ”The people here are all
really nice. At first I thought that I would
get really sick of the town because it was
so small, but 1 really like it, its kind of
cute. rm from Chicago and in Grlnnell
everyone is so friendly, the lady at the
bank actually talked to me and so did the

the post office "

 

Mike Peterson: “It seemed like a real
nice place to be. The upperclassmeii were
really nice, 1 was a little surprised because
i didn‘t know how they would accept
freshmen, but they showed me around,
what to do We started our tutorial and it
seemed like Grinnell would he a little
tough and definitely a place where you
would have to work hard."

Daniel Cymbala: “That Grinnell was 3
Midwest intellectural oasis of people from
all over. There is a real reeling here of
wanted to express one‘s ideas and wanting
to experience and learn a lot, That the at-
mosphere was very positive, Midwest cone
servative, but in a very free way, unlike
East Coast conservatism which is cold and
heartless. _

Jill Ellis: “Grinnell seems to be a coma
tortable place with an easy going at
mosphere and a lot of lunatic people. It
seems to fit my perverse sense of humor.
The people here seem to fit in with my per-
sonality, l really have not been in the town
yet, but 1 really don't like this weather, 1
can't stand the humidity "

What Was Your First

Impression of Grinnell?

Diedra Woods: “That Grinnell was a
very liberal arts school, which I really lik-
ed because there was a lot of freedom
That it was a place where you had to make
your own tun instead of the [un coming to
you, so l think you appreciate it a lot
more.

Mary steffens: "I thought the campus
was really nice. The campus was small
and I liked the Size. Grinnell was what i ex-
pected from the everything that i had seen
in catalogs and literature."

Nick Norl'ls' "The place seemed really
friendly, nice, sociable, slow but fun and
cheap Flat but friendly.”

Gary Knoblock: “The first time l came
here i was really impressed by the diversr
ty of the student body, and the second
time, alter l enrolled and came here I was
even more impresseed with the people
here I come from a little town only a little
bigger than Grinnell so it was not that big
of a change for me, Grlnrleil is actually a
little better than 1 thought that it would be,
it has a lot of character,”

John Townsley: “I was really impressed
with all the friendly people. lthought that
it would be a really nice place to live, i
visited as a perspective and i thought that
it would be a little cold in the winter and it
has been a little too humid now. iowa is a
definite change from Colorado. It’s a little
flat and l miss the mountains."

Each August about a week before
Classes begin, Grinnell College holds a
three-day party referred to as New Stua
dent Days. The purpose of this party is the
orientation of incoming students to the
wonders of college life, Grinnell College is
not unlike other campuses during New Stu-
dent Days. As with campuses across the
country, Grinnell is filled with bewildered
and blank faces struggling to adjust to a
new and often strange environment.

Each of us have memories of our New
student Days and the new experiences that
those days held; our new roommate, our
first college party, and our unabashed inc
dependence. Grinnell College changes
somewhat each year, but think back to
your own wide-eyed first imprasions of
the college and of College life and compare
those thoughts with some from new and
returning students.

what were your first impressions of
Grinnell? Did Grinnell meet your expecta-
tions'?

Robbie Sckalor: “A whole lot of corn and
a lot of nice people. The people were not as
naive as I thought they were when I Came
here as a freshman, because when you
come from the East Coast you think that
people are naive every where except on
the East Coast. it has met up to my expec-
tations I was going to be an econ major,
now I’m going to be an Art and History ma
jor; I've been Grinnellized by the liberal
arts education.”

Paul Tarlni: “It was humld and rainy
out, Everyone was inside, but they all
seemed to be in good humor. It was the
first time I had ever seen a tractor up close
without a fence aound it and a sign saying
‘DO not feed. As i've been here longer the
place has become less of a mystery and
more sedate. There was a lot of things that
i didn’t understand and people that looked
very strange and that were light years
ahead of me, but I don't think that is so
anymore and 1 don't know if it ever was I
think that Grinnell has Changed me, I
could live in a big city, I like the small
town atmosphere a lot."

Rhonda Stuart: “There were a lot of peer
ple .. a lot of strange people. i like it
because everyone was so different. i ex-
pected it to be very boring but it was only
moderately boring! The most surprising
aspect was that less racism existed than I
expected, All white small towns have
negative intonations .. but so far I’ve been
treated no differently while at Grinnell "

Steve Atkinson "It was strange, but i
had a lot of hopes of how I was going to
change the school, it was different and
that was what I was looking for so that i
could be different. it has turned out to be
more than I expected. in the way that it is
like a little community, like a different
world, acutally, where everyone can be
different and be accepted and people don't
care if you want to be different. I think that
that is a good atmosphere to find yourself
and your identity.” ,

. / Do Smoke

by Dunn Hill

Being who I am, a man who has given up
the pleasures of the flesh willingly in order
to indulge more fully in the truly enjoyable
plane of human existence, I feel [am in a
position to relate some of my wisdom to
you. One of my more complex theories
regarding human behavior in matters of
pleasure is that there is nothing in this
world which can compare with the
pleasure man draws from smoking
cigarettes. Having distinguished between
mere entertainment and true spiritual in-
dulgence, I have found that although there
are many ways to entertain oneself during
life, cigarette smoking is one of few ways
in which the entire body and soul can be
engaged in an act that is not only
pleasurable, but profound.

Some of you may also be interested in
what is currently being done by the Tobacr
co Growers Association of America to pro-
mote, and to protect our sacred “adult”
habit According to one article I cut out of
the paper just the other day to place in my
smoking scrapbook, the Tobacco Growers
Association of North Carolina, inc, has
begun marketing T'Sl’lll'ts and license
plates to promote ““19 right to enjoy smoke
ing pleasure.” Their logo is a round symr
bol similar to a no smoking sign, but in
stead of the familiar red line crossing the
circle, the symbol shows a lighted
cigarette with the words, “My pleasure,
my choice" printed underneath. i have
written to them to give them a few of my
own ideas for prospective logos and catch
phrases, including: Alexander Haig's not
dead yet, and he smokes two packs of
cigarettes a day, id rather be smoking
(could be worn by a runner in the Boston
Marathon); and “Cigarettes don’t kill,
lung cancer does.” And there are already
delightful little plaques available at most
Tinder Box locations which display the
frank slogan. "We smokers have deter-
mined that your bitching may be hazar-
dous to your health,”

But sadly enough, the opposition is also
on the move I'm speaking of course of the
beautiful and talented Brooke Shields,
Although Brooke is supposedly fighting
against the smoking "epidemic," she has
managed to do more harm than good for
her cause First of all there‘s her television
commercial, a thirty second, anti-smoking
spot for the American Lung Association. in
it she lies sprawled on her bed playing with
her hair. telling us about her insipid niglll
lite. She tells the story of how, one night at
a party, she met a "real nice guy." She
conversed wtth him for a time, but then
lsigh), he pulled out a cigarette.
(Oooooohlt “It bleiv my whole impression
of him," she says. “And 1 thought he had it
together." Well Brooke, about thls
togetherness thing. Do you recall the time
you went before a congressional subcomr
mitee investigating the dangers of smoke
ing and said, and I quote, “Smoking kills.
and it you‘re killed, you've lost a very im-
portant part of your life,” With enemies
like you Brooke, who needs friends‘7

I do commend the American Lung
Association, however, for one of their
creative and entertaining ideas. One
slogan I found particularly amusing reads,
“Smoking is so fun, you just might die
laughing," Sounds like a great way to go to
me But, some of their other attempts have
been a little off key. For example, 1 can one
ly laugh and blow smoke in their [aces
when they suggest that smoking and
athletics don't mix. From experience I can
tell you that there is nothing more en-
joyable after a good run than to light up a
cigarette and relax lalso find it enjoyable
to smoke while running Doctors have
warned about the dangers of overrexertion
in all types ofexercising, and ifyou're able
to smoke and run at the same time, you're
probably not overexerting anything.

It's quite true! Sports and cigarettes are
the perfect combination. They go together
like coffee and cigarettes, alcohol and
ciagrettes, or sex and cigarettes. In fact,
the only sport i can think or that doesn't
mesh well with smoking, is of course.
swimming Someday, with the advent of
technology, this difficulty will also be
eliminated; either by means of highatech

 

underwater cigarettes, or with special
