by Jeff Raymond

Tony Gatto was found guilty oi breaking
an Office of Community Relations lOCRl
mediation agreement and of violating the
rights guaranteed in a statute in the Stur
dent Handbook wh' 11 states that students
may use the' - r in at any time forstudy
mg or sleeping, This decision was reach
ed In a closed session of JudiCiaI Council on
April 5

Despite the secrecy that usually sur-
rounds a cIosed sesswn of Judicial Council,
Gatto, plaintiffs Janet Wilson and Ellen
Snook and Chairman Rick Richardson all
agreed to speak on record about the case.

The OCR agreement was reached last
semester \vhen Gatto. Wilson and Snonk all
lived at 1227 Park Street. a Haines alterr
nate house. Gatto's base guitar playing,
which bothered his fellow i'eSidents,
necessitated the agreement. The agree

-mcnt set specific hours when noise was
allowed in the house and in Homes when
the residents moved into the dormitory

Janet Wilson and Ellen Shook took Gate
to to Judicial Council when he violated the
agreement. and he in turn brought
countercharges against them for the same
offense. Judicta] Council found the co-
defendants not guilty shook indicated that
she was not surprised to be charged by
Gatto.

When asked whethei'she had made notse
outside the times allowed in the OCR
agreeement. wilson replied. “We probably
have. but not as drastically as he has
Voice do not have the same elfect as a
bass' She commented that there have
been problems with Gatto's bass playing
"on numerous occasions.”

The council recommended to President
Drake that Gatlo no longer be allowed lo
play his amplified bass in his dorm room.
Drake must rule on the recommendation
by this Tuesday Gatto. who pleaded not
guilty to the charges. ielt that he was tin»
fairly singled out lor playing his bass.
whereas stereo players are not as
restricted as he Is

Richardson. however. said that the in-
strument created an unusual noise pro-
blem “A bass guitar operates by resona~
tion. . . when you hear a stereo being
played too loud. it's usually because of the
bass. You can imagine how loud this guitar
sounded.”

Gatto felt that he was not treated fairly
in his hearing Although "Liahna Babener
and Bunny Connors used cogent
reasoning." during the case. he maintain
ed that he did not receive a satisfactory eXr
planation for being found guilty and for be
ing prohibited from playing in his room
"There rwas no compromise on their
(Judictal (.‘ouncil’sl part.” he claimed

“I think we handled the Situation very
well," countered Richardson, He expla nr
ed that the case was difficult because. "I
think it \vasa more emotional hearing than
most," The hearing lasted two and one
half hours

"it's your typical n0lserinrtherhal| pro
blem, said Richardson of the controver-
sy. it really looks like something that.
with more communication. could have
been avoided.”

Gattn presented several witnesses at the
hearing to testify that he played the bass at
a low Volume. But Wilson said that. “It
was unlivable iii the housc.' She alleged
that, “He used to disturb classes In ARH."
with his bass

According to Richardson. the bottom
line at the hearing was that Gatto's bass
playing violated the statute in the hand-
l)0(‘lk "Ihe important thing is that
students primary rights arc in study and
sleep in their rooms '

Gaito said that he probably would not
appeal the council's recommendation

time "

Administration’s South
America stands assailed

by Jeff Borg

"it s time we stop putting the blame on
outside lorces 7 the Nicaraguans, the
Cubans. the Russians 7 and realizggthat
we are a large part or the problem in El
Salvador, Such Is the opinion of William
Durham. yesterday's convocation speaker
and a participant in the conference on
"Revolution Reaction and Reform In ten»
tlal AlnEI'K. '

"We have to look at the social history of
the region and find out why this conflict is
so intense and prolonged We are talking
about a conflict whose origins are deeply
rooted in the structure of Salvadoran
society." ,

Durham indicated that this examination
is something which the present ad-
ministration has not done. by continuing to
pursue the shox'tvSighted policy of support
to the present military establishment. the
United States is helping to polai-ize
Salvadoran society into extremes.

Instead of ending an endless stream of
advtsors and training programs to El
Salvador. the United States, Durham
believes. should insist on complete reform
of a military which is thoroughly corrupt
and dominated by the interests of the
wealthy

The United States, however. prefers to
support the feeble agrarian relorin ot the
Salvadoran government. ”But to present
the agrarian reform: which have now
been completely lrozen, as the promised
transformation or Salvadoran society is a
cruel. pathetic joke. ' commented
Durham.

The dynamics and structure of
Salvadoran society as it influenced the
"soccer war" With neighboring Honduras
in 1969 was the subyect of Durham's
graduate field work in 1975-76, He returned
to El Salvador in 1978 {or a series oi Icc-
tures and is presently an assistant pro-
lessor of anthropology at Stanford Univel'r
sltv

Even in 1976-76 Durham could see traces
of a serious conflict on the horizon Now.
the war shows no sign of letting up.
precisely becai -e the problems that are
rooted in the p; twill not go away

At two points in recent history Durham
believes the conliict might have been
shortened bill in. and became even more
protracted One is the Mdi'ch 1980
assassination 0| Archbishop Oscar
Romelu. the other. the reluctance of the
United states to support the October ltiitl
junta

 

Durham spoke highly of Romero, who at
the time of his assassination had commit-
ted himself to the delicate role of
negotiating with both young leftists and of-
ficials oi the army. and had actually made
significant advances. “The Archbishop
had a Vision of El Salvador and its pro
blelns, a vision of pOSSible solutions which
he was able to translate into dialogue."

The junta which took power in October
1979 [or a brief while provided the hope of
reform without revolution. They made
significant efforts to include the left in the
political dialogue, but in the end were un-
successful in stopping the repression oi
rightrwing extremists and were unable to
control the military. If the United states
had possessed the foresight to support the
junta, Durham believes we could have
prevented a great deal of destruction and
bloodshed.

The present situation, he feels, is "deep-
ly tragic " United States policy is forcing
liberal reformists to take up arms with the
guerrillas because they cannot gain a
voice in the increasmgly uncompromising
and repressive government “El Salvador
is a very polarized society, and we're right
in there causing it "

A Similar Concluswn about. the role of the
United States with regard to Nicaragua
was reached by William LeoGrande. a
staff member of the Democratic Policy
Committee of the United States Senate and
an assistant professor of political science
at American UniverSity. in a lecture on
April 5, A politically powerful Sandmista
party and a private sector which still
wields economic clout presently exist in a
precarious balance which periodically
degenerates into a state of c~ ~s
LeoGrande believes that United States
support of a covert war with Nicaragua
can only play into the hands of hardlmers
on both sides and will weaken the
moderate position,

The private sector may believe that
