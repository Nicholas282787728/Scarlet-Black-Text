More zestful fare for the finer palate

The Grinnell College Catalog is just
chockrfull 01 course listings. However, I
often get a hollow feeling alter wading
through all the possibilities. it seems as it
some new courses should be added to the
catalog Needless to say, I have some sug-
gestions:

BIOLOGY - Vonniedical Careers iii
Biology: This c ursc is designed for unsucr
cessful pre-mcds. The discussion format of
the class will allow students a chance to
bad mouth the medical profession. Field
trips will be taken to the chemistry labs
allowing students to tamper with the
unknown of the next day's lab The course
will climax with the dissection of a real
live RushrMed student. Prereqmsite: A
score in the lower 30th percentile on the
MCAT.

ECONOMICS 495% Bobs in Wonderland:
Bob Grey and Bob Voertman will share
equally in the teaching duties of this
course. This class. will compare
Reaganomlcs to the economic policies of
Mussolini, Atilla the Hun and various Cro-
Magnons. These professors will then sug-
gest a system in which everyone owns
nothing, but all share in governing over it.
They promise to demonstrate that this
system is, “Where troubles melt like
lemon drops.”

EDUCATION 4“- Core Curriculum:
This class will analyze the pros and cons of
a core curriculum at Grinnell College. If

no consensus can be reached, Dean Frazer
and the unnamed faculty member will
decide the issue by means of a winner-
takeall nude inurlwrestlmg match.
ENGLISH l00- The Creative Use at 0x-
yiiiorons: This course will analyze the
paradoxical juxtaposition of words. The
creation and, userot such gems as
“peacekeeping force," “liberal thought"

’and ”Scarlet and Black newspaper" will

be examined This course Will also include

a field trip to Quad. Students will then be
able to observe the implementation of oxs
ymorons in the work environment. lax
amples to be studied include --gourmet

casserole,‘ egggie lasagna” and “stu-
dent workers,"

PHYSICS 444- Practical Problem Solvs
iiig: This course Will suggest a
methodology for solving seemingly dif-
ficult problems, Sample problems in
chapter one include: how to nuke the Gun

Semoor’s - A Student’s View

To the Editor:

lam doing a social studies research pres
ject on Semoor's, a local strip joint. 1 have
spent a good deal of time there and have
come to know the management and many
of the regular customers very well

Recently I learned of a pair of disturbing
incidents which had occurred there, both
perpetrated by students from the college.
The first involved the thieverv 01‘ part of a
dancer’s costume and the Second involved
a case in which some young men in effect
encouraged the harassment of some cola
lege women who were present at the bar.

i was both embarrassed and angered
that these events could occur, Thievery,
even as a prank, is both illegal and wrong.
And, the dancer must new deal with the ex-
pense and inconvenience of replacing the
costume. \

The second incident was at best it‘-
responsible, and could have created a real-
ly serious incident. From my own ex-
perience, I know that juvenile behavior
like this is not considered “coo “ there.

._ To the Editor: -

This letter is in response to Jim
Glllﬁpie's letter of 4/8/83 on liberalness at
Grinnell. Liberals, by definition, are not
bound by authoritarianism, orthodoxy or
established Forms in action, attitude or opi»
nion. In this sense, Grinnell is a liberal in-
stitution and many of its students and
laculty are liberals. Liberals do indeed

‘ promote the airing of opposing viewpoints,
as long as all sides have their opportunity
in the proper time and place to make an
appropriate response. -

This leads me to the main discrepancy in
Mr. Gillespie/s letter. That is, students
protesting Marine recruitment activities
do not deserve to be equated with the
disruption of speakers at gie University of
Calil‘ornia. The Marines’ recruiting in the
Forum were in violation of college policy.
Students protesting the use of Forum
space for this activity had a valid com-
plaint which the administration and the
Marines both recognized, as shown by the
policy. Student protesters did not harass
students interested in talking to the
Marines nor did they attempt to harass the
Marines. In no way does this bear any
resemblance to the Berkeley incident,
especially since no was right to seek in-
formation was Violated. The Marines are
free to recruit at Grinnell just as are all
other recruiters, in the Career Services 0(-
'iice.

The establishment has its own set of well
defined standards and values, and college
students shouldn't go there to be judgmenr
tal or to spoil the experience for others, No
one there has any intention of hassling or
intimidating college students. To the con-
trary. i know they are quite welcome,
However, if students pel‘SlSt in displaying
some kind of aggressive or misplaced at»
titude, trouble may follow,

Let me finally emphasize that the pre-
sent operators don‘t allow disruptions in
their bar, and are quite willing to speedily
remove trouble' inakers Any customer,
student or not, male or female, being
hassled needs only tn tell the hassler to
“lay off," and inform tile bartender. If any
harassment persists the. bartenders will
quickly remove the offender.

Semoor's is a place with a character diir
ferent from most places in town 7 oflering
a different experience. There, as
anywhere else. inebriation can in no way

.excuse foolish or obnoxious behavior. 7

Sincerely, Susan Severance

As far as left-wing political activity is
concerned. groups involved in organized
protest at Grinnell have met the opposition
of some of the college's‘i‘ less liberal
elements. The best example was last spr-
ing’s Die-In on Central Campus. During
the course of this peaceful and lawful
demonstration, a group of 10 students
playedthe soundtracks from the movies
Patton and Apocnlypse Now on a portable
cassette stereo. This activity ‘was an at-
tempt to interrupt the speech by Porter
French and is an example of reactionaries
using heavy-handed tactics to drown out
something they felt no one should hear.
This kind of activity is not synonymous
with ﬁle term liberal and perhaps we
should be aware that me possibility oi
violating the rights of free speech has
already taken place at Grinnell.

_The dividing line between liberal and
conservative need not be drawn here at
Grinnell. Peacelul coexistence of
disparate viewpoints goes on every day.
Mr. Gillespie is wrong in suiting that a
Silent protest of Marine recruitment in
violation of college policy violated free ac-
cess to information. The disruption of pro-
tests by groups believing their own view-
points to be more valid is much more
dangerous and shouldn’t be forgotten. The
problem in viewing things in terms of
liberal and conservative is that valid pro-
test can become confused with disruption
and denial of the right to free speech. 7

Becoming

an insider

Laura

Because Grinnell is not exactly the vacar
tion capital of the world, during spring
break 1 became a patron of the local bars,
dance areas and town “hang-outs". I made
friends, enioyed mysell immensely and,
most importantly. i saw a different
perspective in "townlercollege" relations.
Yet, to my dismay, as Grinnell College
students returned for classes the level of
acceptance towards myself and my cola
lege friends declined at these local “hang-
oue," and the hostility felt toward college
students became apparent‘ 1 found myself
classified as an outsider and only through
continued frequenting of these places have
I actually become accepted as a friend.

why are the college students disliked by
many local residents? To start with, most
college students realize that local
residents consider us to be strange and dif-
ferent — perhaps decadent is a more ac-
curate term. We attribute the occasional
atmcks on college students and the fre-
quent hostile remarks and incidents of verr
bal abuse to be a product DI the local
residents “narrowrmindedness”. I am not
debating the fact that local residents con-
SIder the college students to be weirdos 7
many do, and perhaps we are Nor am l
discussing the “narrow-mindedness" oi
the local residents towards varying
cultures, races and ideas. I have
discovered through my new-found friend-
ships that we are not disliked solely
because of our appearances, lifestyles and
beliels, nor are we resented because we
represent the “unobtainable,” as so many
college students hypothesize The resent»
ment stems lrom our attitudes and ac-
tions

According to many locals, Grinnell Col»
lege students are rude, snobbish and cons
descending. Frequently locals at the
“dangerous” bars openly joke about the
college students' “terror of townles,” their
sellri'lghteous attitudes and condescending

Scbaefer

manner Locals resent the way we "act
like we own the place,“ our apparent cons
tempt for the "untouchables" and our
haughty attitudes as we refuse to mingle
with the crowd

Although a regular, I too have been ques-
tioned as to my reasons for “slumming It
with the townles.” Some have contended I
am doing sociological observations on how
the "lower people" live, and still others
have deClded I must be there on a dare.
Because I am a college student I was im-
mediately classified as a snob. Only
through numerous conversations, dances
and drinks have I become accepted as a
friend,

Perhaps Grinnell College studenu are
unaware of how they appear or do not
realize the implications of their actions. In
any case, I have witnessed the cringes.
looks of disgust and hatred mounting as
college students sweep into a place, ignore
everyone, yelp for their beers and then set-
tle down for a good debate on the Situation
in the Middle East. Are we so unaware and
unobservant that we do not notice the
social codes at these places? Local
residents have opinions and thoughts too‘.
they just do not spout their knowledge to
everyone with whom they came in contact.

Grinnell College students should
reevaluate their liberalness and start
Viewing others in a more accepting inan-
ner. When declaring that I am all to Links,
the looks on my fellow students faces are
incredible, "You are going there? " they
exclailn, as if I have announced a vacation
to El Salvador — “aren't you scared of
those people?" Grinnell students need to
wake up to the real world and realize that
there are more things than libraries and
lectures. Learning how to accept others
and respect their SDClal codes should be an
integral part ofour sorcalledliberal educa
tion.
