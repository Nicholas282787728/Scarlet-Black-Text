Shakespeare’s ‘Measure for Measure’

in the play Measure ior Measure the
Grinnell College Theatre Department once
again explores the great literary tradition
that is Shakespeare. Any time a play is
performed by the great bard it is a treat
tor all those who have the opportunity to
see it. Sometimes, as students and
academicians who spend most of our time
in classes, reading texts and critical
reviews, we forget that most or
Shakespeare's plays were written to be
periormed and enjoyed, not necessarily to
be read and discussed

But the plays of Shakespeare do pose
certain problems for both the audience and
the performers. Shakespeare was both a
poet and a philosopher who had a unique
understanding of the human condition as
well as a rowdy, bawdry entertainer who
seemed to have little sympathy for the
prim and proper audience members who
refused to lose themselves in the evening‘s
fare It IS hard to imagine how the Same
man could have created both Falstaff and
Lear How is a performer, especially a coir
legeperiormer who has little experience in
Shakespearean acting, to capture the deep
textual meaning and the entertainment
value oi the play simultaneously?

This problem is one of the things that
makes this particular production so we
citing. The play is the culmination of a
class led by Ellen Mease and Ed Moore.
The text or the play was examined in depth
and then the cast was chosen from the
class. The players have a deep understan—
ding of what everyjine means on a textual

Is Tb ere life

In asking the question, "Is there lire
alter the Pub?" one must iirst determine
what is meant is "lit " it goes without
saying that any iving tha oes (matter
the Pub closes is not “livin in the cons
ventional sense. but rather an exploration
of an altered state of existence But,
therein lies the secret. For those of you
who go directly home to bed at 2 am. sit
up and take note, ior it turns out that some
of Grinnell's best "nightlife" goes on well
after last call.

Aside from the freshmanrfolly laternight
activities such as bakery runs and walks
on the golt course, there are a number of
diversions tor late night meanderers in
Grinnell. Some oi them are as follows:

1) After/the Pub is the best time to think
about balancing your checkbook. It's fun»
ny how whimsical a bounced check can
seem at this time in the morning, This is
also a good time to make out a budget for
the remainder of the semester, You will
find that you will be much “fairer" with
yourself, allowing your funds to the "ap
propriate" causes rather than to such

Friday. 8 pm. North Campus

Back in the United States for their se-
cond tour, the Shakin‘ Pyramids will
return to Grinnell this Friday night to in-
augurate Relays weekend with their own
exciting style of rockabilly.

At the top of the English charts, the
Shakiii' pyramids- are a lively tour-
member group out of Glasgow, Scotland,
With a heavy emphasis on percussion, the

. Pyramids concert should bea perfect way
to begin the weekend. Also appearing will
be Grinnell’s own The. chbcats. the
warm-up band for the Shakiii' Pyramids.

level but have also spent a great deal or
time rehearsing the play tor its entertain-
ment value Whatever the results, it is a
valiant and imaginative attempt at
Shakespeare and should be seen for that
reason alone,

As tor the play itself, Measure tor
Measure is considered to be one of

[rivalities as an overdue book fine at the
library . .

27 Another surefire aftel'rtherPub diver-
sion is the K»Tel record game. Try and
remember one key phrase from every line
on the Pub jukebox. imitate the groups as
you sing them while stringing them all
together until you have something that
sounds amazingly like a KrTel commer-
cial it you're very good at it you may find

tSee, it really doesn't pay to worry about
that library line. these things have a way
ot working themselves outi

3) A particulalry taxing, but nonetheless
titillating iorm oi late night entertainment
is Charades for Shots The idea is that the
losing team must drink one shot or liquor
each time they fail to guess the other
team's message in less than a minute The
tricky part oi this game is to try and come
up with messages that neither team will be
able to solve, insuring that everyone will
have an equal opportunity to lose and keep
drinking. Such clues as “Book, Remem-
bra'iice or Things Past" are no-fail winners
tthat is, lasers).

4) The most important of all aitersther

Shakespeare's greatest problem plays,
brilliant but difficult to stage. There have
been a good many proiessional produc-
tions, some by the finest Shakespearean
companies in the world, that simply have
not worked. The theatre department
should be applauded lor its willingness to
take such risks.

after The Pub?

Pub diversions is the philosophical conver~
sation To begin this allrlmportant conver-
sation, go to Norris tor any other dorm
heavily populated by underclassmeni and
sit down among a group of students study
ing in the lounge. The reason they are m
the lounge, rather than out and about, is
that they are not yet old enough to go to the
Pub, Since you are older, and presumably
much wiser than they. this is your chance
to become philosophical and to help out the
unsuspecting students. Talk about
Dadaism (They‘ll find you Continentalt.
talk about existentialism (They'll find you
captivatingly moroset, talk about politics
iThey'll discover your ignorance, but it
doesn't matter 7 you're cool, you've come
[mm the Pub) and iinally, talk about your
own personal philosophy on life. These
conversations can often go on ior hours,
which, of course, is the goal of the whole
thing. if you can somehow manage to Sus»
tain your afterrPub life until class the next
morning, you can escape all the
undesirable consequences associated with
a night out, You have come the full circle
and should be ready to begin it all again, at
the Pub, at 11:00 the next night.

While this tilm opens with a sequence
trom a 1939 Buck Rogers tilm clip, its
signiiicance to such familiar, simpler
minded sci-fl flicks ends there Rather,
THX 1138 is a political science fiction film
set in the 25th century, where life and love
are dehumanlzed, and the totalitarian ops
pressors are more audible than visible.

Directed, edited and partially written by
a then~young George Lucas (of star Wars
fame), THX I138 has moved to the ranks of
“space movie" classics. With assistance
from a production designer whose whiter
on-white antiseptic settings contribute to
the clinical, eerie mood, this tilm packs
three hours worth of action and adventure
into 88 minutes.

More absorbing than most science fic-
tion iilms, THX ms features Robert
Duvall and Donald Pleasance. Another
great Relays weekend film, THX 1138
should not be missed
Adam's Rib -119497

This “uncinematic” but well-played and
olten witty comedy derives its humor from
modern variations on the battle of the
sexes. Katharine Hepburn, thin, nervous
and highrstrung, keeps pecking away at
Spencer Tracy, who is solid, imperturr
bable and maddeningly sane. She attacks,
he blocks: their skirmishes are desperate
ly, ludicrously civilized

They are married lawyers on opposing
sides in a court battle; the case involves
equal rights for women, ie., does Judy
Holllday have the right to shoot her hus-
band, Tom Ewell, in order to protect her
home against Jean Hagen? The stars are
well-matc hed tthough Tracy frequently in
dulges in coy mugging). The script by
Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin is lively
and ingenious tthough it stoops to easy
laughs now and thent.

The phenomenal supporting cast in
Cludes David Wayne (who allnost walks
away with the movie), Polly Moran and
Hope Emerson (as a circus strong
woman), Holliday and Ewell, both later
starred, are best when taken in small does,
as in this picture. Directed by George

Animal House

You can't write a review of Animal
House. If you're wondering what it's about
just ask the guy sitting next to you at Quad,
hopefully he won't throw a plate or food at
you: then again, hopefully he will. You see,
that's what Animal House is about. A
bunch ot frolicking, rolicking, yipee yi yea
college boys wreaking havoc everywhere
as they rape and pillage their way through
the campus.

It's done by the National Lampoon peer
pie. so it has a National Lampoon sense of
humor. There is a lot of throwing of food,
throwing ot adjectives, sticking out of
tongues, game playing, joviallty. juvenile
behavior, in short, everything you will pro-
bably cherish in twenty years otter your
college career It's a perfect prelude to
Relays and will put you in the proper
irame of mind tor throwing beer, tailing
down and getting disgustingly drunk. How
much can I say... this is enough

Let's be honest, we all knoiv what the
movie is about, so who are we trying to
fool? If you want to have a great time and
scream and laugh and have one last big
bang beiore the end of the year, then go If
you want to study then have a cup or coir
lee. I don't care, ['11 be drunk

Students are reminded that any damage
to the screen or to other students during
the film will Cause the showing of \niuml
house to stop. MG
