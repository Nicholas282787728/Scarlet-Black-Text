Many factors

by Eric Green

AS of this late date, the Scarlet and
Black lacks an editor for next semester.
Apparently most people feel the job is too
demanding relative to the sparse rewards
it Offers.

There are many reasons for the lack of
interest in the student newspaper. Waldo
Walker, Vice president of the college,
believes part or the problem lies in Grin:
nell’s curriculum, which offers no joure
nalism courses or a major, Walker favors
instituting at least a journalistic writing
course that would ”develop interest,” and
help serve as “an avenue to that type of
career."

William Deminoff, the S&B's faculty ad-
visor, also believes that the newspaper
serves an important academic function
“It is a vehicle for establishing standards
of quality in writing,” he Said,

Richard Letchinger, who chairs the Stu-
dent Publications and Radio (SP and R)
Committee, believes the editor problem
arose because, “There was never an

hurt editor search

organization Within the 5&8 where there
were a lot of people in the ranks moving
up.” Consequently, “you have to deal with
luck in getting an editor.”

A major drawback to the job oi editor is
that no credit can be received for work
done while filling that position. Deminoff
says people “need incentive to serve on the
5&3 and to do well ”

He believes offering practicum credit
would improve the situation. The faculty
committee has rejected this suggestion in
the past because, according to Deminoff,
they were apprehensive about giving
credit without a concrete method of
evaluation.

Walker said that in previous years the
credit proposal was nej cged on the
grounds that the editor received a salary
and thus should not be entitled to credit,
Past and present editors have expressed a
willingness to sacrifice the cash in order to
receive credit.

The 5&3 has learned that the SP and R

Hart talks on arms-control ,

day [Herrick speech]. . . such as restrucV
turing our industry, training our young
people in die work force for the jobs of to
day, and in termsof competing in the in
ternatlonal marketplace.

8&8: Kenneth Adelman, the nation’s
new arms control negotiator is an alum of
Grinnell College, He has written extensive-
1y on foreign policy issues. How do you ex-
plain your opposition to Adelman’s ape
pointment in the Senate to Grinnell
students?

Hart: (laughs) The same way i would
explain it to anyone else. i-iis appearance
before the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee did not suggest, regardless of
whatever he had written, that he had a
thorough knowledge of the history and the
details of arms control negotiations, or
even for that matter the weapons
themselves. I think frankly most of his
writings have been in areas other than that
of arms control. He had given interviews
previously and was on record as having in
dicated he didn‘t believe very strongly in

negotiated agreements to limit the spread
of nuclear weapons and didn’t convince the
Republicansdominated Senate Foreign
Relations Committee that he had the
qualifications to hold that position. i oppose
ed him for pretty much the same reasons i
opposed this administration’s arms cone
trol policy, and it is that I don‘t think it has
one. I think the policy is to build more
nuclear arms in the hopes that we can ms
timidate the Russians into accepting, after
great expense and danger, agreements
which are favorable to us and unfavorable
to them.

5&3: There is a very strong and vibrant
nuclear freeze movement on this campus,
and many Grinnell students may offer
their support in Iowa's first of the year
causcuses, depending on which
Democratic presidential hopeful offers the
clearest, most forceful stand on the issue
Why should Grinnell students choose you
on the basis of this issue over someone like
Senator Alan Cranston who has declared
himself me peace candidate?

Hart: Declaring oneself something

will recommend to the faculty that credit
be given to media workers. Even ifa credit
proposal is approved, it will not be in
stiiuted until next spring at the earliest. An
editor has already been selected for that
semester.

Walker, Deminoff and Letchinger all ex-
pressed concern about the possibility that
the $313 may not exist next semester.
Deminoff and Walker were hopeful that so-
meone would step forward before the end
of the year Letchinger, whose committee
review applicants, was not optimistic but
said, “We'll look for an editor right up to
graduation,”

Letchinger added that he was “bitter
because people do not realize the impore
tant function of the 5&3." It is a source of
free expresswn without which Grinnell
would be at a real loss. Not only Will
students lose a source of movie reVlews,
news and personals, but also an important
vehicle for the expression of real
concerns.

doesn't make you so. . . otherwrse I would
declare myself president. I think Students
at Grinnell and elsewhere who are con
cerned about the arms race will look at me
and find in my eight and one-half years in
the Senate I have been as strong an ad
vocate for a whole variety of arms control
measures as anyone else in the race, and
almost anyone else in the Senate for that
matter. 1 was for arms control long before
the freeze came along. The arms control
issue predates the freeze and likewise my
own commitment to it, whether it was the
SALT II treaty, introduction of a com-
prehensive arms control policy of my own
before the resolution, several trips to
Geneva, my position as Senate advisor on
SALT II treaty and on a wide variety of
other sianos. i don‘t know ot any in-
dividual in the race who has what you
would call a pure record, that is some one
who is opposed to every new nuclear
weapons system, including the Blebomber.
There is no perfect candidate on this issue.
and you don't become one by just saying
you are.
