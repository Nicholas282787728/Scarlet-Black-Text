funds.

Kopelman's resolution was tabled and
put on next week’s SGA agenda, Discus-
sion on Kopleman's resolution lasted for 20
minutes

Joint Board this week also discussed
amending its constitution to accommodate
a new role for the Political Activities Sup
port Fund (PASF). PASF Chairman Rat:
fael Stein proposed an amendment, which
was later postponed until next week. The
amendment would have renamed PASF
and increased its responsibilities
significantly. Greg Donovan, chairman of
the Student Rules Committee, made a
counter-proposal that was less drastic but
which also would have expanded PASF'S
commitment, That, too, is to be considered
next Wednesday night.

The proposed amendment and its alter»
native were each to replace Section 2.C. of
Article VI of the constitution of the Stun
dent Government Association, which cur
rently reads, in part: “The duties of this
comittee are. . . to use this fund [PASF‘] to
bring political figures of interest to the
campus, and to lund politically oriented
student groups.”

Stein's proposal would also have the
newly-named Committee on Student
Poliﬂcs serving “to review all proposals of
a political nature that seek Joint Board
passage" in an advisory role. Critics
charged that the proposed new csp would

Klatz also descried the argument mat
some media positons deserve credit
because they demand too much time,
”There is a myth about classes being too
hard to allow time for extra—curricular ac-
tivities. If they [students] want to do it, the
time is there,"

Dirrent sen editor James Lyons shared
Klatz's opinion that media participation
should remain purely extracurricular He
went so far as to say that the salaries
should be abolished and the funds used to
enhance the media quality through train-
ing programs.

Lyons contends that the money is not an
incentive. “The only incentive is

have too much power to change and/or re
ject ideas brought to it by students, but
Parliamentarian Eric Fisher informed
Joint Board that ”A committee is there if
someone wants to use it. He always has
recourse — he can always go to Joint
Board.”

Stein defended the spirit of his amend-
ment, saying “it's not very easy to write
up a resolution and bring it up in front of
fifty people," and then went on to explain
how he felt that many students just don't
know how to present a political proposal to
SGA. Ethan Cohen's resolution concerning
El Savador that was presented and sounds
1y rejected last week was given as an ex-
ample of an idea that might have worked
had it been more lormally prepared. stein
also cited things such as grammatical er-
rors and format problems that would. by
his plan, be resolved by the committee

Jim Scott, a president of oil‘campus,
collegeowned housing, then presented the
proposal for an absent Greg Donovan, It
was broadly similar to Stein’s, except that
Stein’s second clause, which mandated
that the proposed Committee on Student
Politics assist in the political education of
the student body. " Scott argued that that
clause would give the committee (do much
power allowing it to promote one political
group or individual over another.

Mike Oxman then moved to table both
motions. After a brief rules problem pre-
discussion was postponed until next week.

something implicit in the activity. implicit
in that one gets a certain amount of ex-
perience and satisfaction from putting it
[the newspaper] out each week " He
stressed that most students who par
ticipate in Grinnell’s media are motivated
by the experience it offers and the oppor
tunity for them to display their work for
the community.

Although no proposal is in the offing {or
this year, any future proposals involving
credit for extracurricular activities
should be scrutinized to determine their
general implications for the meaning of
extra-curricular and, more importantly,
their affect on the autonomy of student

Maiorily of Grinnell students oppose_

draft registration

by Ken Scotton

Despite the fact that the results of the
survey showed that the majority of the
respondants oppose registration, must of
the comments on the survey were written
by students who supported registration.
Their main feeling was that Americans
had an obligation to serve their country.

“Freedom is not a Godrgiven ight it
must be paid forr The reason pacifists can
be pacifists is because other people are
Willing to protect them."

Others wrote that they registered
because it was the law, and also because
they felt that there was no reason to be
concerned at this point. "I see there is no
moral obligation destoyed here. By signing
a registration card one is not supporting
war, but is only preparing for war before it
comes, perhaps even preventing it."

There were mixed feelings as to whether

the college should replace government
financial aid lost by nonrregistrants,

“Why should Grinnell college provide
financial aid to those individuals who are
so naive as to believe that by not register-
ing, they are in any way preventing an
armed conﬂict.“

Omers felt mat the college should make
up the difference since only those who
were on financial aid were being
discriminated against. Some believed that
this was not the college's responsibility
and that the consequences of civil disobe-
diance should fall on the shoulders of the
nonrregistrant.

“l have no respect for these people who
are not willing to stand up for their beliefs
regardless of whether or not they are in ops
position to mine or not,"

As for the results of the survey in

Cleaver completes Japanese Research

by Ted Kniker

“I wish people would stop referring to
them as the inscrutable Japanese," said
American Studies and English Professor
Charles Cleaver. Cleaver disagrees with
the myth of the mysterious orient. He
doesn’t like to generalize about people, but
feels the Japanese a very warm people,
“The people are very friendly 7 having
flower arrangement as part of a person’s
training says something about the
people,” he said,

Cleaver is Just back from visiting Japan
this summer, where he finished research
[or a book he will write on Japanese
culture.

“The book will deal with adjustment to
space, I wanted to find out whether culture
in the big cities, such as Tokyo, is much
different than culture in a small village,"
Cleaver said,

Another reason for carrying out the
research was that there is no strong coma
parison to make between America and
Japan, ”You really learn something it you
can hold up two things Side by side and
look at them," he said.

Cleaver's interest in Japan began in
1945, when he was part of the U.S. occupa-
tion at the close of WWII. He discovered
that propaganda about the Japanese peo-
ple was “just untrue." lie was assigned to
teach literacy and was assistant director
of a Japanese school

Since then, cleaver has been to Japan 8
to 10 times, primarily on teaching exr
changes, Comparing Japanese students to
Grinnell students he said, "Students there

work like hell to get into college, but once

they're in it's pretty certain they will
graduate and get a job.”

“The relationship between the student
and the teacher is a lot stronger in Japan
than here. When classes were over they
threw parties and gave me presents. They
must be very brave to take courses in
English, It puts their learning of the
language to the test,” he said.

Cleaver stayed in Tokyo and commuted
to small villages “to sort of hang out.” His
research was predominantly observation.
Cleaver said that within a five mile walk
ing distance from where he stayed he
could get all of his necessary supplies.
“The neighborhood is like a Village," he
said “Within 15 minutes, you have a little
city — a national bank, etc. Within 30
minutes [by train] Tokyo becomes the
nucleus of all these little towns,” he con-
tinued,

”It's perfectly sale to walk the streets.
There are no really poor people because
the unemployment rate is around two per-
cent The police are wellrtl'ained and are
regarded as friends,” Cleaver added

Cleaver's love of Japan includes a rock
garden he constructed in his back} 3rd He
looked at Japanese rock gardens and
decided to put one where nothing would
grow in his yard “Grinnell needed a rock
garden," he said

The highlight of his trip was making
friends, ”We have a lot of close friends 111
Japan,” Cleaver said Cleaver plans on
returning several more times to see them
and to do more research. ‘I have a sab»
batical in a year and a hall I_ could
possibly go back t erl ", e said,
