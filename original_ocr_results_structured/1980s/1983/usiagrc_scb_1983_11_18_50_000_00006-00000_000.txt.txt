l'ecewed much critical acclaim (including
praise from Rolling Stone and Trouser
Press) and little fame. Though they have
toured the East, including a date at New
York's Ritz, they remain relatively
unknown outside of the Midwest. This is
unfortunate because they are very. very
good. Ex-Fun Boy Three member Terry
Hall once said that only untalented bands
make it big in America If this is true then
the words ”Fools Face" will probably
never be said by Casey Casem, tor they
have more talent and appeal than all of the
bands in the top torty put together.

The Romantics really weren't that bad.
just more rock and roll than expected, But
as rock bands go, they are one of theleast
objectionable. They did not act put—out to

do, and enjoyed themselves while keeping
the audience on their feet. They played a
lot 01 songs which sounded the same m not
unpleasant, just not original or complex
sounding. They tthank God) kept the
screeching guitar solos to a bare
minimum, and did not isolate thier drum-
mer as many rock bands do: in fact, he
sings lead vocals on many songs, including
their biggest hit "What I Like About You."
However, the Romantics must be used to
playing in big time concert arenas,
because they certainly played at "rock
and roll volume " Not everybody likes
straight rock, but The Romantics
presented theirs unpretentiously, and
without glitter (though loudly), and gave
the audience exactly what they came tor.
