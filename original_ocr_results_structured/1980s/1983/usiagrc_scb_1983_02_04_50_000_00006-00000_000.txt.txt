against lllinois College,” Coach Cathie
Schweitzer said following the Saturday

mouth, Harvey said, “We played hard for
50 minutes and battled back from deficits
on several occasions."

Gene Reid and Craig Rasile started
playing here the same year Dombrowski
began working and consider themselves
friends of Dombrowski. It was Dom~
browski who in 1979 talked to young Reid,
who earned a third-team running back
spot on the Division III All-American foot-
ball squad this year, about coming to Grin-
nell. ”He told me that if I want to play Col~
legiate football, I wouldn‘t be bogged down
with it here. 1 could get some serious stu-
dying done. He also told me about the pro-
gram. He said not to be discouraged, that
it would be a long tedious process for the
program to become a winner, He said that
by the time I was a senior, we would be .500
or better."

But the program never turned around.
As Reid and Rasile’s careers progressed,
they noticed a particular problem on the
part of the players. “The athletes here
tend to be a little more tickle than you
would find at a Division 1 school," Rasile
said.

Reid agreed, “The players have a
tendency to be selfish. They want to play
the position they want to play. Dnme
browski did his best to accommodate
everyone, but the problem is that you can't
have a team that has 28 running backs and
two linemen.”

‘ As a result, clashes broke out between
Dombrowski and the players. Players,
dissatisfied with the fact that their posi—
tions were being changed, left the team.
resulting in a very high turnover rate.

Said Reid, “For example, [one of the
players] is a good athlete. He could play
bodi running back and defensive end.
when a freshman came along who was a
good running back, Dombrowski logically
wanted to move [the first player] to the
defensive end slot. After all, why have one
good running back and one bad defensive
end when, by moving [the player] to defen-
sive end you could have both? It would be
good for the team. But, [this team
member] couldn't understand that. He on-
ly wanted to play running back.

“My philosophy is: just put me on the
field. I have the talent, [can do the job."

As Grinnell‘s losing seasons wore on, the
administration became increasingly
restless with the football program. Accor-
ding to Reid, die administration, with the
assistance of Dr. John Copeland, an alums
nus from California, evaluated the football
program last year, The verdict:
something was wrong in the coaching
department.

“I'm more than sure he would have been
fired if he hadn't resigned," Reid said.

Waldo Walker, executive vice president
of the college. Said that Dombrowski
resigned ”on his own accord" and denies
the fact that there was any evaluation on
the part of the administration of the foot
ball team. In fact, he denies the whole con
cept that a coach can be fired at Grinnell,

“At the end of each year, the athletic
director and I get together and decide who
will be coaching the teams next year. For
example, John Harvey, the women’s ten~
nis coach, could be the football coach next
year." Since Dombrowski's respone
sibilitiﬂ are not limited to coaching,
Walker sees no problem with the fact that
Dombrowski has one more year on his con-
tract.

Walker did acknowledge the fact that the
coach is responsible [or the winrloss
record, “Saying that your coach has
nothing to do with your win-loss record is
like saying that your key players have
naming to do with the win-loss record.”
Walker, nevertheless, believes it is a
“combination“ of things.

Reid and Rasile, however, who believe ,
that the administration was involved in the
Dombrowski resignation, think that it is a
tragedy that Dombrowski is held responsi-
ble for Grinnell's losing football team.

“A lot of people on campus have
misconceptions about Dombrowski's
talent as a coach,” said Rasile. Said Reid,
“He's not as bad as people believe.

“This year, for example, we had eight or
nine guys on the team who had never
played football before in their lives! And
then the administration wonders why we
don‘t have a winning team. Well, how can
we?”

Rasile stated, “All Dombrowski has to
do is drag the administration down to the
PEC and show them films of our nine
games this year, We were clearly outclass-
ed.”

Rasile's outlook for the football program
is “bleak." He foresees it possibly being
abolished. “I say, waituntil next year. The
freshmen on the team think it’s going to be
a whole new team with a new coach. But
it's going to be the same story all over
again."

Since the announcement of his resignar
tion last November. Ed Dombrowski,
Grinnell's former football coach, has
refused to comment about his resignation.
