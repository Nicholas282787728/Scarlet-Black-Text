Academic Dishonesty at Grinneil

by James Lyons

Eleven students were charged during
the 193283 academic year with dishonesty
in academic work. This figure represents a
100 percent increase over the previous
year.

or the ii cases, five involved plagiarism
on papers and six involved violations of ﬂ1e
rules in preparation of laboratory reports.
Charges were brought against the students
by the instructors of the courses in which
the violations occurred. College bylaws re
quire that instructors refer all cases of
academic dishonesty to the Committee on
Academic Standing.

The Committee rendered the following
decisions: one student was dismissed from
the College: two were failed in the courses
where the dishonesty occurred; another
student was placed on probation, and three
were assigned zero grades on work involv-
ed. Students not disciplined were urged to
take greater care in avoiding further Viola-

Lions or the rules or honesty, The Commit-
tee on Academic standing may impose
whatever penalty appears to be in the best
interest of the student and the college.

Robert Voertman, Prolossor of
Economics and member of the Committee
on Academic Standing, advised students
and members oi the faculty to read the
section of die Grinnell College Handbook
on ”Honesty in Academic work.” It ap-
peared to him that many of the students
Charged with academic dishonesty were
unaware of college regulations pertaining
to preparation of assignments.

The Grinnell College Student Handbook
states that, in addition to plagiarism,
dishonesty in academic work also includes
“manufacture or deliberate alteration of
data submitted in connection with
laboratory reports, term papers, and the
like."

Pub Cuts Hours

by Brad Vander Linden

Cash flow problems have forced the Pub
to cut 20 hours from its operating schedule.
The Pub has been open Monday through
Saturday from 4 pm. to 1:30 am
However, the Pub Board announced last
week that the Pub will be open from 4 p,'
to a pm. and from ll) pm. to 1:30 am.
Monday through Thursday and Saturday
nights. Friday nights the Pub will have
regular hours from 4 pm. to 1:30 am.

Rising labor costs and the price tag on
the 1932 renovation project last year have
caused die cash squeeze on the nonproﬁt
Pub. The Pub Board decided to reduce
operating hours during prime study time,
rather man raise prices to pumprup profits
to cover its deficit.

Student Reaction Mixed

Senior Derek Vroom said it bothered
him “a little bit" that the Pub will close for
four hours every night except Fridays. “I
would rather have it open 7 every hour
counts." it's probably better for them that
they close. For some reason the Pub isn’t
as crowded as it used to be. I think I've
noticed a reduction in the number of peo»
ple who frequent the Pub. Freshmen seem
to be overly concerned with academic pur-
suits."

“i think it's terrible — 6 to 10 is a prime
time to be down here before I do some
serious pubbing,” said junior Guy Montag.
“I understand the fact for financial
reasons that it's either that or raise prices.
I’d rather see them cut hours than raise
prices.”

“It really didn’t effect me that much,"
said junior Mark Cloud. ”There have been
times I didn’t come down here because 6 to
10 is prime studying time.”

“it really blows," said Alan Abramsl
“They used to get 30 people down here for
“Hill Street Blues.” If Mitch Rowe has any
sense at all he will open early. It's more
than a business ~ it is an obligation to be
more than a business because the college
charges such a small rent.”

Pub Manager Mitch Rowe said if the de-
mand is good enough the Pub will extend
its hours.

Rowe said that the renovation project
”went quite a hit over any estimated costs.
and we had some insurance bills to pay

that were carry overs‘rrom last year."
From ‘BerZ, nowe said, the minimum

wage increased from $2.70 to $3.35 and the
Pub suffered from that wage increase
throughout the entire year.

Pub Board President Pete Hautzinger
said board members believed students
would react more favorably to a cut in
hours than a price increase.

“We basically had a choice or raising
prices or cutting hours and it was his opi-
nion of the Pub Board that public opinon
would react move favorably to a cut in
hours,” said Hautzinger.

Rowe Said that the Pub tries not to
“undercut the prices or the bars in town 7
namely the Longhorn and The Bar." “That
way,” he said, the Pub “isn’t stealing
business from them and we’re not pro-
moting a cheap beer come-down-and-get
drunk type oi place."

Hautzinger agreed with Rowe, saying
the Pub has an agreement with the college
Board of Trustees not to engage in price
wars with bars in downtown Grinnell,

“We’re pretty even (in price) with them,
and it we raised prices they (Grinnell
bars) would be appreciably cheaper than
we are now," Hautzinger said.

Rowe said Hie recent recession affected
business last year and profis were down
about 5 percent last year. In 1981-82
business was higher and the Pub realized a
prolit. However, even with cash surplus,
the Pub ran a deficit after the 1982 renova-
tion was completed.

Rowe said there were many unexpected
costs in the renovation project, including
ripping out the floor, installing 3 hrs resis-
tant ceiling and adding an extra door.

The Pub has had dimedraw nights
which are not profitable. But, Rowe said,
“Those are promotional things that are
gifts from the Pub to the student body.”

“It’s mainly PR. work to aid in the rela-
tionship wiui the college community,"
Rowe said, and Hautzinger agreed.

During the Pubs in years of operation it
has generally turned a profit each year,
Rowe said.

“We were able to build quite a savings,
and thus had the money for approximately
$15,000 for the renovation."
