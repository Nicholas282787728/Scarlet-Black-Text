The problem ol declining enrollment
plagues Grinnell like most other
schools. As or yet, the decline in high
school seniors has not hit here, but if it ,
should, Hopkins feels the college would
continue its operations. He stated that
”Grinnell lived through the depression,
World War I, World War II, the Korean
war, and the Vietnam war. We suffered
a decline in enrollment then and con»
tinued to operate."

The admissions process is important
to the survival of Grinnell, and while
students here may see prospective
weekends. interviews, and publicity
only superlicrally, the procedure
literally decides the population content
of Gl‘innell College. Prospective
Weekends and |uture admissions
policies are extremely important to
Grinnell because they will decide the
attitudes, student body composition,

' and general atmosphere at Grinnell.
