An exhibition of drawings and
pastels by student artists Jeiirey
Peirce and Greg Evans is current-
ly on display in the Forum Terrace
Gallery. While neither of them is
an art major, Peirce and Evans
have been studying art in classes
and independently since high
school, Technically and stylistical-
ly, each artist advances unique
aesthetic concerns; their works
also differ in thematic intent. The
coexhibition of such disparate
types at visual expression invites
comparison and leads to a greater
appreciation oi each artist’s
creativity.

Jeiirey Peirce, a junior, works
primarily with coma and pastel,

Anyone who missed the ap»

Lecturer on the 17th and 18th 0!
September missed an event at ma-
jor importance. Although i am not
competent to judge Alired Bader’s
importance as a chemist and
businessman, his importance as an
art collector is unquestioned. He
has appeared in more than one
national-magazine listing of
”America’s 100 Most Important
Collectors.“ When this was men-
tioned, his wire lsabel shrugged.
That is understandable. There is,
after all, a certain {utility to such
lists.

In his speeches, Mr. Bader
characterized his collecting urge
as a sort of “disease." But Mr,
Bader's humorous view of himself
was shared quite seriously during

contrasting hue and experiments
with black and white overlay.

The works in this exhibit by Greg
Evans, also a junior, are executed
in pen, pencil, ink, and charcoal,
He is more concerned with nar»
rative content than with style or
technique, The human iocus of his
compositions is represented most
oiten through visual realism, as in
“The Illustrator" and “Howard
Roark.” The intentional distortion
oi visual reality, exemplified by
his portrait entitled “The Dream is
Over,” effectively underlines the
emotional state oi the subject.
Evans’ appreciation ior the human
form is demonstrated in his depics
tions oi runners, whose iacial ex-
pressions and tensed muscles imp-
ly the strain or athletic competi»
tion.

Everyone is invited to attend the
artists iniormal reception this
Saturday, September 25, from 4
PM. to 5 PM, in the Terrace
Gallery. Refreshments will be
served The exhibition will run
through October 3.

his childhood by those close to him.
When Mr, Bader was a child, an
uncle oi his gave him money with
which to buy a box camera. Being
ieckless and irresponsible, the
young Mr. Bader took the gilt-
money and bought instead an old
drawing ior sale in Vienna. Today,
perhaps, many would consider this
a sign at precocity or great sen-
sitivity, But Mr. Bader's uncle
thought the action very strange.
Young Alfred must be, well, touch-
ed in the head, deserving
psychological attention, lvir.
Bader's concerned mother. obser-
ving such unusual habim as well as
a certain lack of skill in school
mathematics, did indeed take the
uncle’s advice. The doctor’s con-
sidered opinion (no doubt after
months oi Freudian analysis) was

that there was no cure ior young
Alired. That was just the way he
was and ever would be, Both Mr.
Bader and those who have since
come into contact with him have
beneiited trim the doctor’s
understanding,

Mr. Bader himsell has an
understanding oi and an affection
ior others, witnessed by his friend
ly and compassionate wit. This
personal characteristic, a unique
view oi others, an independent or
original way oi dealing with
others, is reilected in his collection

itseli is the thrill of the chase. Buyr
ing at auction or private sale. Mr.
Bader acquires approximately 200
paintings a year, Do not be
mistaken and think that each painr
ting carries a “line art" price-tag.

Not at all. Mr. Bader has bought
paintings at junk stores, small ans
tique stores, and the like. But what
each painting does share is that
hint oi quality. Mr. Bader is never
more pleased than when he can
take a misattributed, dirty,
perhaps slightly damaged painting
and save it ior posterity through
restoration and a recognition oi its
true worth. Having begun his
career as a paint chemist. Mr.
Bader believes that he can
recognize an old painting merely
by is painted suriace or “tilm”
(including such considerations as
varnish, etc.J.

Many oi his iinds are possible on-
ly ior one who has a good eye, who
can clearly remember particular
painters’ stylistic quirks — their
ways oi handling paint, the reveal»
ing and individual manner in
which a painter handles hands or
draperies, ior instance.

At one small European shop, Mr.
Bader asked the proprietor it he
had any paintings. “Paintings? My
house is full of them!" the man
replied, It was all too true; and

the man had given to his new wife

This amusing anecdote, one
among many, reveals very well
that some oi the people ior whom
he has been a client neither
possess, nor would probably want
to possess Mr. Bader's remarkable
appreciation for paintings, as they
have other concerns. The loss is
theirs; for Mr. Bader, and others
like him, is one who improves life,
preserving and celebrating those
works of artistic genius that, con-
templated, restore our sanity and
our equilibrium. instructing us and
changing us in subtle ways. His
collection and his articles in well
respected journals, such as the
Burlington Magazine, represent an
important legacy oi art and
knowledge.
