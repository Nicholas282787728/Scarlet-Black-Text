The Soil has learned that the election of
Doug Rowe as 1931-82 SGA president and
the Selection Of the 1981782 Judicial Court
\lere not in accordance with the SGA con-
stitulion,

. Article 1. section c oi the current SGA
Constitution states: The SGA Preslileut shall
or UlUt‘lt‘ll by thestudent burly mull must FULeiUL’
ii muynritv of thosc votes cost This otcctton
shollprrtt'dtl all orlwr SGA elections. The exact
procedlut‘ of lllU Ult’t'lirm is to be cstabti'shcd by
tho SGA Election Board, Subject to tho apprnual
of the Joint Board and must take phzce no lntcr
than tiuo months priortc graduation exercises "

The original election was held Wednesr
day, April Bl WEI. and due to a run—oft in
the Presidential election, Rowe was
elected April 3, 1981. two days uitcr Teri
Gould was elected SGA vice-preSIdent and
only a little more than a month beiore
graduation exereises which took place on
May 19, 1961

in an effort to streamline the election
process and encourage more people to
vote, the Election Board proposed to the
Joint Board last semester 3 new set 01
guidelines that were approved March 4.
1981. and supplanted the old guidelines or
the November 1979 Constitution. The
tormer Election Board guidelines did not
stipulate when the presidential elections
should be held; that was covered in Article
I of the Constitution. The new Election
Board guidelines. though, state. in clause
9th}: "The Election Board shall open nomina-
tions to the campus no less than two weeks

prior to thc election; and tho Picsi‘ctcntiut and
VtL-L'rPrt‘sldt'rthul elections shrill lie on tho sumo
dolls. "

According to Andy Cameron, who is cur
rently Election Board Chairman and also
held the office at the tlme oi the presiden~
tlal election last year. "The by-law con-
tradicts Article I as it now stands and it
should have been caught but no one notice
ed; it wasn't anyone's duty to [ind cone
tradiclions 'As tar as the by-laws are
subordinate to the Constitution, we have
an illegal president." Cameron also said
that Rowe would have had to have been
elected by March 13, 1981. in order to have
been elected constitutionally since March
19. which was two months beiore graduar
tion exercises and the latest possible date
for the election according to the Constitu~
lion, {ell during Spring Recess

Cameron cited a number of reasons for
the electoral delay. among them: the
delays in getting the new Election Board
guidelines passed through the Joml Board.
which must raiily any proposed by-law at
two consecutive meetings; the {act that
there is no copy oi the SGA Constitution
which includes all by-laws and amend
ments added since November of 1979. and
the delay caused by Spring Break. He
believed. "The election did not follow the
letter of the law but does not violate the
spirit of the Constitution. We did nothing to
contravene the spirit or the Constitution,"
He added. "But that wouldn't hold up in a
court."

Cameron tell this i ‘a case 01 the Coll-
stltution being impract oi lor the best in-
tcrests of the students“ and praised the
current Student Rules Commlttee's ciioris
at updating the Constitution

Provisions ior selecting Judicial Council
members are Conlalned in the SGA Conr
slilutlon under the title, "Regarding Artie
cle Ill — Branches 0t Government:
Judicial; Section A — The College Judicial
Council " Part ideals with the selection oi
the council and_subsection "a" states: “All
five students will be conﬁrmed by May I "The
student members or the turtles: College
Judicial Council were contirmed by the
Joint Board on Sept. 23, ism. These
members are; Shari Rauland, Chairman
Craig Rasile, Warren Schulz. Tracy
Miller. Mark harms and alternate
Katharine Allemus, secretary

Judicial Council Chairman Rauland
acknowledged the May 1 deadlne, thought
lt serves a purpose and tell it should be
adhered to. Slated Rauland, "The May 1
deadline is there to insure that a Judicial
Council is in place when the school year
starts in case there are any conllicls very
early in the year. Technically lhe Judicial
Council is illegal because technically it
says all live students will be continued by
May i." She thought the blame tor the
delay in selecting a Judicial Council was
-~wholly with the SGA administration'
Judicial Council Secretary Allemus con-
curred by saying, “The situation rcilects
poorly on iliis year‘s lSGAl administrar

lion,"

Rauland also acknowledged the problem
with the lateness oi the presidential eleCr
tion and noted that the Student Rules Com.
mittee was not yctrthosen in order to per
lorm its role as a watchdog commilicc
over other committees But, she telt, the
current son administration, "could have
made Judicial Council a top priority." She
stated that the large number oi applicants
tor the live student positions made it dil'
iicult to select a Judicial Council early this
year but that doesn't negate the cons‘llluA
tional deadline oi May 1. She said, "If we
have a Constitution we had damn well betr
ler iollow it or just get rid oi it because the
purpose at a Constitution is deiealed it we
ignore it when the rules are inconvenient
and abide by it when the rules are conver
nienl."

in spite oi the Violation oi the Constitu-
tion. Rauland believed a Judicial Council
is necessary, in order to become legal, the
Council may ask the ‘Joint Board to pass a
by-law ‘or a constitutional amendment
granting them power for this year. or re
quest the Student Rules Committee to
grant them a special dispensation to exist
only ior this year as a special SCA com-
mittee since the SRC guidelines allow the
Committee to do that. "One way or
another. there has to be Judicial Council."
Rauland said She added. "Vlolatlons oi
the Constitution are a serious problem and
need to be addressed “

have to compete with other stations that
already occupy those irequencics.

it S.P. is n. chooses instead to increase
KDIC‘S wattage, the station would need to
invest in a new lower and a new antenna.
Chasins, however, would like to see these
improvements as well as new equipment
within the station: She Sald that currently
KDIC "Can't keep up with maintenance
costs“ on its old equipment and, therefore,
the investment would be a good one in the
long run She cited the cost oi the changes
as around 515.000

Chasins would also like the station to “go
stereo " She commented that the combinar
tion or loo walls and stereo would give
KDIC “a larger audience, better sound
and a better rapport with record comr
panics who are more likely to donate new
relcses to larger stations. it the wattage is
increased Chaslns anticipates that KDIC

would still do educational programming
and would be essentially the "same station
we are HOW “

Chaslns emphasized that when KDIC
renews its license it will “legally have to"
choose one or lhe'above options. but which
option has not yet been decided, The ﬁnal
decision will be made by Sp, b R. and its
outcome inﬂuenced by the degree of linen»
cial commitment made by the college's
Development onicc. Chasins is currently
writing a proposal which she said will
“outline the situation" and recommend
that KDIC increae to 100 watts and go
stereo.
