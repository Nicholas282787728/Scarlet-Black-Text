Reduced Class load for profs,
increased concerns for students ?

professors are required to teach
from sic pcr year to ﬁve (a. .o

Clll-rently, the different de-

Charles Dale's request, arc in

The nece'sslly of doing some

is necessary for us to been a stit-
dent perspcctioe.

From a student perspectiue,
the result of decreasing class
loads without hiring new pro
fessors will be bigger classes or
fewer classes,

Students do not pay almost
113,000 a yeor to Grinncll so
that they can sit in a class
too large to hold dtscllsslons.
They do not choose to lnvest
four years of thexr lures in a
uery small luberolorts college so
that they can be shut out of
the courses that do not apply to
their major. -

Duhe is aware of tltzs. “My job
is to mahe sure euery lntrodllce
tory class is not a lecture class
wltlt 100 students," he said. He
pointed out that it is possible
that some class sicec can be in.
creased with no detrimental efe
fects on the students. He said
that a class of so is pretty much
o lecture class, so on rncreosc
from .70 to N is not going to
male much of a diﬁsrence. An
tncl‘ease in size from fire stu-
dents to 117 can be beneﬁczal.
The problem will be if classes of,
say, 15 students now go up to
.90.

Duke said he has reguested
that the preliminaryschedules be
made with the assumption that
all nan-lllafor classes (eg the
humanities courses, the sctence:

It has already been discussed
by some jilwfcssm‘s that the
freshman totoriol should be clinr
mated. Whale the value of ane’s
tutortal generally uories from
department to department, de-
pending on how it 75 taught, doe
ing away with it entirely would
be a mxstake,
vElSaﬁ‘ar pointed out that the
decrease ln class load wtll prob-
obly nﬂecl freshmen more than
anyone since they usually tohe
more introductory-level courses,

“When we talk about llEC'l'EGS-
ing class loads, ave’ne really talk
ing about freshmen, " dish/yor-
said,

With fewer professors
teaching intmvletlel courses, the
size of the classes is sure to go
up, "This is why it ’5 so rmporr
tant to loop the smallesized tut
tortal, " he said.

The three-two proposal
will not be put tnto eﬂecl this
school year, so seniors will not
be affected, However, everyone
else will be. That is why it is im-
portant that students houe some

lltelltbel‘s at'c, Tall' with your
professors if you hare a concern
about the curriculum. One re-
sult of the new classrlond sched-
ule ’llllglbl be that more classes
will be taught on an alternate
year basis. Thlu means that we
as students will have to decade
earlier what we plan to take dul'e
ing our stay in Grinnell, This
could be a serious problem for
students planning an indepen.
dent mayor or concentration

If you feel there is a weakness
in the number 07' sizes of the
courses offered, roice your con-
cern.

Yes, everyone is busy, and
it to only too easy apatheticolly
to let somethtny like this slide‘
by. But remember, ellminat-
lng one course per professoT per
year without hiring new prefer
sons could mean oneesizth fewer
courses will be oﬁened. It can
also mean that the classes that
remain wtll be larger, especially
at the introductory lellel.

The rewards for silence are
not promising,
