Isn’t. existence enough ?

it an object. ction. or concept has not

This philosophy does not deny existence oi
something whether or not one person is
aware oi it. but protesscs that existence is
relative to an individual's awareness. To

positiw changes to Grinnell‘s Black
i ccrtntmenl policies. it you have any Lom~
plaints about college administration or
anything clselhatoltects the quality oiliie
at Grinncli. do soinclhing about it. bring
the issue to I'elerenduln
