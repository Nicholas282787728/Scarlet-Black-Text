This will undoubtedly benefit us

According to the team, the trip was
“loads of fun, and We all benefltted by the
practice on our golf games and the general
relaxation of the week." Hopefully the
practice they had will give them a little
edge over the other teams in the Cons
ference and help them toward a strong
Midwest Conference finish.

fresh and so inscribed in places and on
minds that It appears with hallucmatory
timelessness.”

Some of the film’s most striking inter
views are with the former SS officers. men
who served in the concentration camps
and who were part or the machinery of
slaughter. When none oi the former Nazis
would talk to the director on film. he Set
about filming them secretly with a camera
concealed in a small canvas bag. A grainy.
black-and-white image of the aging, infirm
Franz Suchomel appears on the screen.
and he recounts in great detail the process
of mass murder in which he took active
part: the Jews’ arrival by train, the
psychological tactics employed to get the
groups to strip naked, the cutting of their
hair, the herding into gas chambers, the
burning of their corpses in ovens. and the
final dumping oi their ashes into a nearby
river. Mr. Suchomel says with a certain
pride that the whole process took only two
hours for an entire train of a few thousand
people.

“Shoah” is a meditation, a private exp
perience. The film has no background
music or historical narration; there are no
cues or prompts from the director for emo»
tional reaction. Even Mr. Suchomel is
treated with respect, never labeled “bad
guy." We are not led on the leash of the
commerical film, to which our every
generic reaction has been carefully plann-
ed and predetermined. Here, the viewer
must make his own decisions. In "Shoah,"
we are on our own. ,

“There is a logic to the construction of
the film,” Mr. Lanzmann told The New
York Times. “It is not a series of inter
views put one after anodier; yet die con-
struction is rigorous, obeying a kind of
musical logic. You have themes that open
up and then disappear only to be picked up
at another level, but at a higher volume.”

and motifs that weave in and out of the pic-
ture: a river that carried in its current
both a small Jewish boy, alive in a boat,
and the ashes of his incinerated family:
the slow roll of cattle cars packed with peo»
ple; and houses of slaughtered Jewish
families, now homes to Polish villagers
These motifs appear and reappear, each
time with a greater significance and more
symbolic meaning.

The film runs nine and a half hours, and
is being shown this week in its two parts on
two consecutive nights. The organizers of
the screening. members of the Jewish
students' group. Chalutzim, say they hope
that the length of the film will not deter
people from attending. Audience members
are free to come and go as they please and
stay only lor as long as they are able.

On Saturday evening Calutzim is spon-
soring a discussion of the Holocaust with
Dr, Andre LaCccque, a professor of the
Old Testament at Chicago Theological
Seminary. Dr. LaCocque’s family aided
Jews in their escape from the Nazis during
World War II, and he will be recounting his
personal experiences at the talk. A dinner
with Dr, LaCocque, open to the campus
community. is being held at 6 pm, Saturr
day in Cowles’ PDR 2.

Go to “Shoah” — not because it will
answer your questions of “How could it
have happened?” and “How could we have
let it happen?,” because it won't. “Shoah”
will only raise more questions and make
your puzzlement and rage more defined.
See "Shoah," for as you begin to formulate
the questions in your mind, you will ﬁnally
touch upon the horror which was my unex-
pected Bronx-synagogue-basement
understanding.
