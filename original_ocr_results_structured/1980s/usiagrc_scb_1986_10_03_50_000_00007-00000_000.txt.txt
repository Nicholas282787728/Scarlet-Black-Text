Unstrung Knees

The start of each school year brings
many changes: new classes. a new dorm.
new iloormates. Yet. one aspect oi the
beginning of each semester remains the
same for me; without the consistency it
provides from one semester to the next I
do not know what I would do. I refer to the
urge to get organized. How many of you
also get bitten by the “Let‘s get
organized" bug? Symptoms include an
urge to want your life in order, the convlcr
tlon that this may be accomplished by
scheduling your time efficiently. and the
belief that this is an easy task.

The thought oi being a wellorganized,
inrcontrol person always has appealed to
me. Its appeal is greatest at the beginning
of a semester, when several syllabi stare
me in the face and dare me to find the time
to complete the work they detail. Thus
motivated. I find myself purchasing an
academic planner. These books are
disguised by many other names (eg. daily
diary. executive diary, weekly appoint-
ment book), but their format generally is
the same. A whole year is divided, decepe
tively neatly, into months. weeks, and
days. Spaces are left for the owner to fill
with the activities to which he intends to
allot his time. Though the urge to organize
hits me with great consistency, the desire
actually to carry out such a ludicrous idea
never persists. My planners usually end up
in the back of a littleopened drawer.
gathering dust until I throw them in the
trash before going home ior the summer.
Why.lhen, you may wonder. do I continue
with the aforementioned annual folly? I
continue to buy these planners because of
the wealth of important and useful infor-
mation they contain.

Those of you who own a planner know
what handy—dandy reference works they
prove to be. Look in the back of most any
reputable planner and you are sure to find
a veritable treasure trove ot supplemen-
tary information which will bail you out of
the most sticky academic binds. What do I
mean by supplementary information? I
refer to the copious tables of metric cons
versions, apothecarles' weights, nautical
measures. and other seeminglyruseless
lists which accompany these items billed
as ”planners." i could peruse this inforr
mation for an eternity. or at least until the
accompanying calendar runs out, and
never master all the knowledge offered.
on the few occasions I have carried my
planner with me, I've been darn glad to
have had it. I used to lie awake nights.

tenth wedding anniversary. I lie awake no
more ii my planner is handy. How many

times have you sat at a computer terminal
feeling stupid as you are unable to help the
person who suddenly screams, “Peeks!
Pecksl I must know how many peaks in a
bushel! Chains! How many chains to a
furlong?! " The feeling of stupidity is only
intensified as a snide, obviously well-.
organized ireshman whips out his planning
implement to come to the afﬂicted soul's
aid. This need occur no more, it you keep
your planner handy.

A search of planners on my iloor reveal-
ed that some are better than others.
Metric-conversion tables and lists of
holidays are standard equipment in a plan-
ner. it yours does not have these leatures,
you have been duped. Better planners, I
have found, abound with a much greater
variety of (acts. Jim’s planner details the
risings and settings of the sun. lists the
holidays of thirty-iour well-known coun-
tries, and contains a vintage chart which
evaluates what I assume to be some of the
best wines available. Jim always has im—
pressed me with his wine savvy. a handy
area on which to be knowledgeable for his
classes here at Grinnell, “The 1945 Red
Bordeaux is the best." he is rumored to
have dropped in his math class, “but I
would recommend avoiding White
Bordeaux Of the years 1951-1961. It was a
bad decade, you know.” Eric claims that.
in addition to a chart of wine vintages, his
planner contains evaluations of different
kinds of wood, information about their
grains. and uses for which they are best. I
never have known Eric to lie, but I suspect
he might be telling me this in a blatant ef-
iort to top Jim.

As is the case with any standard

‘reterence work, these planners deal with

highlysensitive information requiring the
utmost of accuracy. Use of incorrect con-

~versions could prove fatal. It is for this

reason that I am glad that the editors of
one of the volumes at which I looked had
the foresight to include a disclaimer:
“Whilst great care has been taken in cDmr
piling the iniormation in this diary. the
Publishers cannot accept responsibility
ior any errors," They thus have avoided
what could have been some pretty nasty
lawsuits. the details of which I do not want
even to suppose,

The companies which market these
books are working off of two basic human
tendencies: No one wants to be disorganiz-
ed, and no one wants to be a fool. How con-
venient that one now can conquer bodi oi
these obstacles simultaneously, The Dic-
tionary, the Thesaurus. the Atlas 7 and
now. following the tradition of those great
works of reference comes the Planner. No
game should be without one. Get yours to»

Quiet as

I‘m sure that there has not been anyone
among us who, during the past couple of
weeks. has not complained about the
weather. Those oi us who happened to
leave our windows open or who live in a
dorm basement may especially remember
Saturday, September 20. 1986.

Certainly. we are justiﬁed in our com
plaint about “Iowa weather." Certainly,
the hardship and inconvenience we have
experienced as a result oi the weather over
the past few weeks is intolerable. BUT
CERTAINLY. a drive through any oi the
corn or soybean fields around Grinnell will
convince us that we are the lucky ones.

I think that it is safe to say that in the

three years I have spent in Iowa, no one
has impressed me more than the iarmers.
As a group. they have the utmost in my
respect. reverence. and admiration.

Our lives might be inconvenienced by
weather. but the life of the farm hangs on
its every edge. Three years ago there
wasn’t enough rain to produce a suimble

crop. This year there is so much rain that
what might have been a suitable crop

could go unharvcsted because the fields
are too wet. The smell of musty carpets
may be unpleasant, but I wonder what it
must be like to smell hundreds oi acres of
molding corni

Perhaps the two most admirable traits
about farmers are dedication and
perseverance. Citrus farmers in Florida

spend litany sleepless nights doing
whatever it lakes to warm the air around
their trees in order to prevent frost
damage. Five years ago. iarmers in the
Pacific Northwest had to contend with
volcanic ash in apple blossoms, on
strawberries, and over all of their fields.
In Iowa, farmers depend on mother nature
to provide rain or irrigation.

It all boils down to the simple fact that
farmers really have no control over their
work environment They can't develop a
new advertising campaign to expand their
market. They can‘t build huge domes over
thousands of acres of land in order to
create an environment divorced from the
idiosyncrasies of weather. They can‘t
move dieir corporate headquarters or
manufacturing plants to more economical-
ly conducive locations. All they can do is
be patient and be optimistic.

So. if it is such a trial to be a farmer —
why do it? Therein lies the answer. In
other words, farmers shouldn't have to
make a list oi reasons to explain why they
farm. If there were a list of reasons it
would be too easy to argue against those
reasons.

Thereiore, the beauty oi farming and the
reason for my great respect for the farmer
stems from the farmer's commitment and
devotion, in a day and age where logic,
profits, and success are a focal point of so
many. the iarmer has remained true to a
way at life. They love what they do. and no
setback is suiiicient cause to quit. Maybe
all of us should take a lesson from the
farmer and remain more committed to our
own tasks or goals 7 irregardless oi
whatever hurdles we may encounter.

WORK FREE DRUG PLACE?

ii you have any ideas ior a new name ior
what was formerly “The Pub" please drop
a note in Box v-z. In a meeting with people
who use the area, it was agreed that a new
name for the area was definitely needed.
I'm not sure what the selection process
will be (Presidential decree?) but I'd like
to see some ideas as soon as possible.

Also. on a more long-term scale, I'd like
to see the area repainted. Don’t get your
hopes up about this happening soon, But
evenutally. A hitch I hadn‘t foreseen ls
“The Union,” We students will not be able
to paint the area ourselves. It must be done
by union painters. (Which is part oi the
reason why it won’t happen in the near
future.) We should be able to say how it
will be painted, however, so if you have a
good idea ior a painting scheme ior the
area. please let me know, Due to popular
demand the Worley Room (that room bet

ween the Pub Area and Gardner) is now a
Sanctioned graffiti area. Try to limit
yourselves to that room please. I hope
everyone (except Harrison) is enjoying
the area.

SHAVHD FEET?

Being your typical ignorant male, there
are certain aspects of female life that I
don‘t understand. or even if I think I
understand. there is usually something
that perplexes me. One such aspect bi
female life is the shaving of the leg
phenomenon 7 or more precisely, the
shaving oi the feet question. I recently
noticed in one of my Psych classes that a
woman next to me, I'll call her “Jane."
had extremely smooth ieet. il'm talking
tops of feel, not soles. for those of you who
are lost.) Now I also noticed that ”Jane"
shaves her legs, and so this typically male
question occurred to me: Are her leet
naturally hairless or does She shave her
feet'l I’m hoping that the women of this
campus can answer this question ior me.
Tell me please, rcaders oi iemale persuar
sion: It you shave your legs, do you shave
your feet? If so, where do you start? At the
toes, or midway to the ankle, or what? I’m
sure the men of Grinnell will find this most
informative,
