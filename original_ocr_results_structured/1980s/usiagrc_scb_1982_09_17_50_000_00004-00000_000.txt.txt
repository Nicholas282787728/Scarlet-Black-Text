Constructive

criticism has

proper channels

Recently it came to the attention of the Scarlet and Black editorial
staff that a Grinnell faculty member has publicly ridiculed the 58:13 as
a whole, and individual students‘ writing published in the newspaper.
We feel it is inappropriate for a faculty member to deride student
writers‘ work in public, especially when those persons are not pre-

sent.

If a member of the faculty, administration or student body has a
complaint or comment to make about the quality or content of the
58:3 he' should write a letter or speak personally to the editor. All of
the editors welcome constructive criticism, but if we never directly
receive this criticism it is difficult to change or improve in that area.

The staff views its work as a learning process as well as a service to
the campus and strives to produce a newspaper of consistent high
quality. However, we are the first to admit we do not always succeed
Thus, we welcome the criticism of our readers directly, but not
behind our backs. Ridiculing the 83:13 will not improve its quality,

All about North

This is Norui Campus, and on North
Campus parties are what they should be:
loud, noisy and obstreperous. Who reading
this has not heard of “Dibble
Wednﬁday’"! Who has not had some
friend tell him that his dorm has been
either warned or fined for loud stereos? ,
That's what makes North Campus so
great. Where else can you iind rowdy foots
ball players carousing with psuedor
intellectual snobs? Where else do magic
markers become deadly weapons in the
wee hours of the morning?

As [or all the hullaboo about North, well,
all I can say is pthoo. ltis my personal opi-
nion that the Norui Camponns are,
well, just a hell of a lot more fun U’lan their
placid counterparts on South. I mean,
come on, who gives South Campus a hard
time on Saturday morning? No one, since
they ‘re all too busy holding torches as they
march towards Norris in an attempt to
destroy the foul beast that blarns sounds
like Godzilla.

There is just no way on this planet that
South could ever live up to the parties oi
North. In only two weeks, Norris has run
approximately $100 in debt. Two
weeks! Dibble too is staring at lines for,
loud stereos. In the lunch room, where the
innocent bystanders sullenly bemoan their
sorry circumstances, I had a chance to
hear that Rawson also is high on the list oi
noise aggressors. Just a few days ago a
meeting was called to denounce the
flagrant violation of human rights
perpetrated by the stereo menace. How
did the students react?

I talked to one student. We will call him '

Lothar. I asked Lothar if he would now
stop playing his stereo as a result or the
meeting, “Do you think students will con-
tinue to have loud stereos?” “We will,"
was the unflinching reply. He men went on
to damn the inhabitants of Park Street who
dared to complain. “We‘ve been here a lot
longer than they have." “Everybody does

it,” was another reply, this one given by a
tequila guzzling freshman, his slow bum-
ing cigarette‘s smoke waiting like spider
silk across the scarred experience oi his
tace. What spirit! Tell a South Campus
native to be quiet and one will find reticent
quiescence; tell the same thing to a North
Campus inhabitant and you’ll probably get
a beer in your face.

Until you have been in Norris for a cous
ple of nights, you cannot understand just
what noise is. Every night, starting at
about 11:30, the walls (paper thin) begin to
rock. with all the stereos going full blast, it
is not surprising that instead of hearing
music, onerhears a kind of dull white hiss,
the combined eminations of 10 stereos
together in the ioulest sound possible. Add-
ed to this is the erratic percussion of heavy
bodies smashing into walls, the shrill
screams of irate girls complimenting th-
less than steady beat. One can go down to
“party central" where people are partying
24 hours a day (Well, they do sleep, they
have to!) and rum and tequila flow lik
honey down the gullets of freshmen an
seniors alike. All this on a Tuesday!

Norris seems like the place that all th
creatures that meet on Walpurgis night in
Faust go to after their interlude with
Mephistopheles, Grinning faces meet yo
as you walk through the halls, twist-i
faces, the agony of existence in “th-
Prison” all too obvious on the once
youthful expressions of incomin.
freshmen. The tales one hears about Nor
nearly all originate in ”the Prison's” con
lines. With its narrow halls and non
existent walls how could it be any dif
ferent? It is a hard life on North with Lh
constant bombardment of drugs, alcohol
loud noise and rowdies. It is the kind of lif
that hardens you. It is the kind of lite than
greatpoets dream of and never achieve. I
is paradise and hell. It is Norris and Dib
ble, Rawson and Gates, Miller and Bud.

Sarcastically, GrinneII

One of the better subjects ever to com-
ment on at Grinnell is Burling library and
since this week marks the grand opening
of our new and improved, bigger and bet-
ter library, I affectionately title this col-
umn “Fond Memories of Burling
(Library?).”

For 33 years Grinnell has lived under the
auspices of the original Burling and 1 hope
that for 33 years people have enjoyed Burla
ing as one of the better jokes on this cam»
pus; a good or bad joke depending on your
point of view and your sense of humor, The
dictionary defines library as “a repository
for literary or artistic works,” and Burling
did serve this function well. (Note: it serv—
ed the function well because the deli tion
did not Specify “a safe repository," Burl-
ing’s roof leaked terribly and no book on
second ﬂoor was ever safe. Burling staff
spent the winter tarplng books, and the
spring months were spent fanning them

dry.)

For college students, libraries are more
than repositories though, they are the
quiet havens to which we retreat when the
dorm stereos are creating sonic booms.
But somehow I doubt that we would ever
refer to the old Burling as quiet, much less
a haven. Burling served the campus as the
college’s continual answer to the
fraternity-sorority mixer. The library was

the nerve center for the social scene. Eve
Yale’s insiders Guide to Colleges recogni .
ed this fact when it wrote, “and a friendi

For the uptight, upright Grinnellian
who are always feeling guilty about in

So Burling the “joke" may not have bee
