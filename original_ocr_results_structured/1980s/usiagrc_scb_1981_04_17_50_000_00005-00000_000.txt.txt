to working with Teri next year I think
we make a good team."

This year's election ran much more
smoothly than in past years due to
changes in the SGA byrlaws regarding
election procedures. Paul Volkei, pre-
sent SGA president, explained that in
the past, SGA has been beleaguered
with complaints that the elections go on
forever, that the candidates don't cam-
paign seriously and that SGA is ineiiec-
tual. While about one-half of the student
body would vote in the first election, by
the fourth Or fifth runoff, few students
were still voting. The effect of this inef-
ficiency was to produce a feeling or
helplessness and apathy among the stu»
dent body concerning their role in slur
dent government,

Certain members of the SGA fell that
a change was in order so last year Julia
McCray and several other members of
the Jomt Board drafted proposals for
changes in the SGA byrlaws intended to
simpliiy and shorten the elective pro
cess. Although they were amended
when put to a vote earlier this
semester, the proposals were later ap»
proved The changes include, first, that
me president and vice-president are
now elected at the same time. in the
past, there were separate elections for
each, The option of running the
presidential and vice~presidential can-
didates as a ticket was explored but re-
]ected, However, Volker noted. combin-

presidency by 10vo‘les

ing the elections still reduced the
number of elections by one-hall,
Secondly, the qualifications for a valid
candidacy and’vote were made more

* clear, In the past, the election officials

had counted all votes including those
cast for "joke" candidates such as
Velcro Kitty or Jimmy Carter, Coun-
ting these ballots made it more difficult
for a valid candidate to attain a majori~
ty or votes Now, all joke ballots as well
as all ballots for ineligible candidates
such as graduating seniors are discard-
ed. Dl the'GEO ballots cast this past
week, 25 were discounted as illegal
ballots.

According to SGA regulations, a can
didate must win a majority (50 percent
+ l) of the votes and not just a plurality
(highest number] of votes. Teri Gould
won 50.24 percent oi the votes in the
first ballot and a run-oil between Rowe
and Rauland, who won a plurality in the
first ballot, guaranteed that one can
didate would win a majority because all
write-ins were to be discarded,

Volker said that he was encouraged
by the way the election was run this
year. He believed, “The democratic
right of students has not been bastardiz-
ed or jeopardized, As long as shortening
of the elections is achieved and the in-
terests oi the student body are prev
tected, then this was a success."
