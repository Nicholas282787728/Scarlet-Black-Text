“F” grade prompts‘mo’re reaction

To the Editor:

It is with ﬁre-treluctence that] write
this letter. During my years at Grinnell
1 was always a bit annoyed at alumni
writing indlolantly about “internal"
college matters but I feel a need to res-
pond to Steven Burnett's letter concem-
ing the “F" wade.

His argument concernlng com-
petitiveness and the G,P.A. are certain-
ly well taken. One llmld not benefit at
the expense oi another. However, given
the high percentage of Grinnell
graduates applying to (and later Itlenv
ding) graduate school, Burnett
overlooks a critioal concern. Whatever
their purpose within Grinnell. 6.? A s
are often determining factors in adm .
sinn to graduate programs. An “F"
grade should be viewed in that light as
well (or omission of the grade

studalts but not without negatively im-

Similar arguments were made during
my stint at the college but those sur-
rounded the plus/minus grading
system. Because many graduate
schools (at that time) dropped tlle +/-

in considering applicants, it was of no
advantnge to maintain a “plus" grade
(3+ = B, while A- = A).

I (eel this little bit of realism may
lend Burnett (and others of similar
thought) a broader perspective on this
matter. — Sincerely, David Coroll,

To the Editor:

The recent decision by the facility to
reinstate the “1“" grade and the “drop
while passing/tailing" is based on
several malevolent misconceptions
about the Grinnell student body. The

' “F" grade’s reinstatement is due to the

that that Grinnell studenu are inherent
1y lazy and altogether too eager to drop
chums than do the required work. The
faculty considers the ”F” grade and the
“DWP/DWF" as the right form of
punishment to curb this deviant
behavior. This is outrageously
lallacious. Grinnell students are adults
and, as such. are perfectly capable oi
deciding when the pressure is too much
and something has to give. I do not
believe students “casually” drop
courses but do so in extreme conditions.
There is no reason, with the academic
standards Grinnell maintains, (or
students to {all a course unless there
was an outside pressure impinging on
them.

The faculty‘s lack of iaith that we are
intelligent adults is astounding. The on-
1y justification for any grade is a petty
system of rewards and punishments If
education is of primal imporlance, such
a system only interteres. Grades have
never been accurate measurement of
growth or prom-as. (Indeed it is possi~
ble to get an “a" in a course you know
very well with little effort and struggle
to get a “B" in a course you know little
about and have to put in twice the el-
lort: do these grades reﬂect how much
you have learned, as the definition of
“grade" implies?) What is needed is
not the “F" grade but a system to ac-
curately measure the student's growth
and gains. — Sincerely, John A. Kerr
