by Mike Alexander

Grinnell‘s forensics team, under the
coaching of Liahna Babener and Coleen
Conway, is well into what promises to
be a very rewarding season. Last year,
the group consisted oi only SIX students.
This season, which continues through
April, the team has twice as many
members, all of whom have had
previous experience in competitive
speaking,

Although forensics is generally made
up (it several programs, Grinnell's
team concentrates on individual speak-
ing events. The team and their prefer-
red events are: Lindsey ,Black

Fcrculty rejects Skip Day

by Jody Hoffman

By a voice vote the faculty killed SGA
hopes of reinstating spring Skip Day as
a school sanctioned activity at
Monday's meeting. This is the second
time the faculty turned down a Skip
Day resolution since they first abolish-
ed the event in May of 1979.

in response to present policy pres
blems, SGA considered four alters
natives, according to SGA President
Paul Volker. The SGA felt they had to i)
leave present policy as is, 2) move Skip
Day to Saturday, a) cancel Skip Day, or
«ii ask for faculty sanction of one Skip
Day. The fourth alternative was
presented to the faculty,

President Drake opened discussion
by stating that present policy produced
a “halfrhearted skip Day in the fall."
Major points oi opposition concerned
general scheduling of Skip Day. Biology
professor Diana Robertson stated that
“Laboratories are planned months in
advance . . the plants prepared are
usable on one day only," Robertson also
brought up the diliiculties involved in
the loss of a lab or lecture in the short
three and one-half week biology units,

Problems oi inappropriate timing
were brought up by math professor Ar-
nold Adelberg. These problems include
ed days when speakers and visitors,
such as prospective students, were to
be on campus

In response to scheduling problems, a
faculty member amended the resolu-
tion to require a seven day warning for
faculty and students. Adelberg objected
to this amendment stating, "You can't
do thatiit might rain." Since Skip Day
is a celebration of spring, planning that

(extemp., impromptu), Eric Secoy (eic
empt., drama), and Tom vitt (exemp,
impromptu).

On Sept. 26 and 27, the team traveled
to Ames to compete in what Conway
called “a highrpowered tournament."
Among the teams present were those
from Bradley University, ranked tirst
in the nation last year, University of
Illinois, and University of Wisconsin.
Considering the major size differences
between Grinnell and such schools, the
team, according to the coaches, did ex~
ceptionally wcll. Although Grinnell fails
ed to make finals in any of the events,
and thus earned no points, Conway was
pleased with individual performances.

This Saturday, Grinnell is hosting a
forensics tournament which will in-
clude among others, groups from
Drake University, Graceland College,
Iowa State University, and Northeast

the weather.

Support for the skip Day resolution
came irom iew faculty members. One
stated that "Skip Day is worth the
disruption . . I’m perfectly willing to
miss a lab occasionally "

Whe asked about the faculty's deci-
sion, Volker said he was “surprised and

Blood drive goal:

“The Blood Drive is a very wore

should strongly support,” urged Teri
Gould, The Student Coordinator’s 0f-
fice, in conjunction with the Central
Iowa Community Blood Bank, will hold
the event in the North Lounge on Oct
29, so, and 31. It began holding blood
drives every spring and fall in 1974.

Students may sign up for appoint
ments to donate at dinner on Oct. )3 in
Cowles Dining Hall and Oct. 14 in Quad.
Faculty and Administration will
receive sign»up information in their
mail boxes. The coordinator's office
will place postcards in donor’s
mailboxes right after break to remind
them of their appointments.

When donors arrive at North Lounge
for their appointments, nurses will take
their medical histories and tell them if
there is any reason they should not
donate. To help donors recover their

encourage all students to come out and
observe some of the best speakers in
the midwest.

“It would be nice to see a little more
academic support for forensics at Grin»
nell," said Conway. “Several schools
offer full~time classes and even majors
in speech. At Grinnell, forensics is com-
pletely extracurricular. it independent
classes in speech were offered to the
Studean, those interested could have
the opportunity to spend much more
time learning to excel in these methods
of communication."

season should see equal or better

Gould said the drive is taking place
shortly after break so that donors will
be refreshed and healthy,

The Coordinator's office hopes to
match last spring’s record high of 292
pints despite the advantage or spring
semester drives, which seem to attract
more participants.

with one exception, Grinnell College
has the highest percentage of par-
ticipants in its blood drives of all the in-
stitutions which hold drives with this
blood bank. The one exception is a col-
lege of about 100 students.

Donors may have their blood types
determined through the blood drive.
They will also be able to receive blood
from this blood bank if they ever need it
while in a hospital it serves,

Students may also support the Blood
