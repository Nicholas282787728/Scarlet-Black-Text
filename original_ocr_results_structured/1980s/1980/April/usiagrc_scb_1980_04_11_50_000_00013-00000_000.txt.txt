Symbol and the corporate rascals

Despite their criticisms of corpora-
tions for’bctraying the public interest,
oppressing minorities, exploiting
whole economies, and helping

, perpetuate unemployment, inflation,
and a whole host of social problems,
today’s skeptical liberals resign
themselves to the belief that corpora
tions in modern industrial SOCleties at
least serve the vital lunction ol dispen-
sing symbols that serve individuals'
psychic identity and 50cm] and value
needs and wants.

since symbols appear in all
cultures, they appear to serve psychic
needs, Symbols are cultural in con
tent, but their expression may he in
dividual or group or culture-wide.
Symbols' luiictions include Various

kinds of societal, social. and individual v

dillerentiations as well as the underly»
ing, broader purpose of identiiying an
individuals, group‘s, subcultures, or
society's values or ideals. Since in»
dividuais naturally desire a sense oi
personal identity, social benetits, and
a feeling oi security in values and
ideals, they attempt to associate
themselves and be associated with
these symbols.

Since modern industrial countries
are populous, national in culture, and
highly stratified and organized, the
corporations’ symbolrdispensing role
is left uncriticlzed on the basis that
they are the most effective mediator
providing the masses with their
psychicaily-desired symbols. Symbol-
hunger is believed to characterize
statesocialist societies where goods
are not produced to serve these sym-
bol wants, and decentralization is
viewed as an unnatural attempt to
substitute local culture for national
culture and consequently decor-
poratlze and diversity the symbols
against the obvious tendency towards
the uniVCi‘saltZatioi’i oi symbol struce
tore evidenced by worldwide western-
lzation Thus, hierarchicalization of
local cultures would occur in a decen-
trallzed system, resulting either in lm~
mobility or chaos

This view. however, wrongly
assumes that the symbols which cor-
porations market iairly represent
authentic symbols arising out oi peo-
ple in the societies of which those cor-
porations are a part. First, the sym-
bols drawn lrom somety that corpora-
tions market are advertised,
manipulated, and tailored to private
consumption in order to create
markets tor private goods ior mass
production oi the symbols, to corner
markets, and to stabilize or direct
symbol want patterns, all tor the pur-
poses oi protit maximization and
power concentration.

The symbols are consequently drain-
ed or any meaning in the conversion
irom authentic cultural representa-
tions to mass consumption media,
warping the content of the symbols
themselves and, by consequence, the
cultural values of the symbol cone
sumers, Second, corporations create
their own symbol hierarchies in
material goods of little dilierentiabili-
ty and elieetiveiy market these pro-
ducts to symbolrconscious consumers.

Because people identify themselves
with these valueless symbols, the new
symbols have reduced human
character to productsimere symbol
arrays. in our symbolrconscious
literate society the idearsymbol mere
chants thrive on an everchanging
Search for the relevant, the “idea
whose time is here." Because people
are symbol-seeking they avoid out
moded idea-symbols and adopt ideae
symbol lads. Thus. the idea~symbol
merchants market symbols, not ideas,
and idea-symbols with dynamism and
relevance take the market. As a
result, substance is ouLsold by style
and the media becomes trivialized.
Radical-chic publications gain greater
popularity over iora where less lad-
dish, more deiinable, idea-laden words
are used.

The scenario is bleak: with the
deauthenticatlon and exploitation of
symbols, their ultimate value to our
culture is no longer served by the
system oi symbol want seeking.
Rather, the symbols serve the mer-
chants, the manipulators of them.

Not only has our society developed a
dishonest system of symbol creation
but it has fostered economic ruin in
the process. Since authentic symbols
arise from individuals’ interactions
with their environment, a true system
of symbol creation would tend to
adapt to the environment while sym-
bol manipulation by corporations ioils
healthy adaptation in the interest or
the symbol manipulators. Second, the
corporation-induced symbol economy
has drained scarce economic
resources in the interest oi serving
that system's symbol wants in a way
completely out of relation to human
economic needs.

One of the major idal-symbols in
the world today is ireedom, which,
coupled with a sense of nationalism,
encourages in the eyes of many
economic growth and development.
This misguided View of nationalism
has been lurther induced by transna-
tional enterprises. The symbol of
ireedom is exploited and abused by
corporations seeking maximal profits
with adverse effects on the qualitative
value of that symbol, Even while stock
manipulation, the shattered Viability

of the marketplace, and uncertain
domestic and international monetary
trends characterize the economic
scene, the larger commercial
establishments have attempted to
rekindle the idea that democracy and
ireedom are viable symbols oi a na
tion’s independence and solidarity,
which in the View of these err
trepreneurs stabilizes a nation's
yearning for liberation.

The symbols oi hope and progress
are iurther perpetuated in a climate or
mass ignorance, The masses, so long
crippled by the rapacious nature oi
negative capitalism, nevertheless
define these symbols in terms of the
conspicuous consumption of goods and
services, often of little practical value
If ireedom, independence, hope,
democracy, and progress are symr
bolized sacreligiously by these goods,
how can we expect to achieve the real
goals of a peaceful, secure, and well—
ied world where the ideals oi hope,
progress, [reedom, and democracy
might be possible?

The present power of America’s core
porate interests is very noticeable in
this country's ioreign policy, Rooted in
gunboat diplomacy and stimulated by
the benefits of economic imperialism,
this trend continues in current i
diplomacy in the Middle East and
Airica. We have attempted to play '
games With nations, giving them the
illusion oi ireedom while conscripting
them into a system of peonage. While
our leaders pull iniluence in global
politics with symbolic talk or ireedom
and selfrdetermination, the meanings
of these symbols are not substantiated
by policy. -

America is practicing a malignant
nee-imperialism which starvcs people
with the agricultural and military
technology we market while we con-
tinue to sell the concepts of mutal
cooperation, hope, and charity.
American ioreign policy has con-
sistently advanced the symbols of
representative democracy and univer»
sal suffrage while opposing these
rights ior the people or many Third
World countries. In the case of Africa;
the purpose oi this proposition is to' , :
support ugly racist policies at home.
President Carter's bogus principle of-
human rights is a very recent exam
ple oi symbol abuse. .

Obviously, the power elites ol the
world have taken control of the sym-‘
bol structure for the purpose ol pu ng
societies away from ideals which don‘t
accord with their personal, selfish .
desires, it humanity is to Survive, we
will need to take the power of symbol
manipulation away irom these power
elites so that expression will become
more spontaneous and emulation

auu-lentic. ‘l ’
