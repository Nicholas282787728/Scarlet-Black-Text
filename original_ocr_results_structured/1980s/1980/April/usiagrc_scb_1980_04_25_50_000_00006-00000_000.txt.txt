Last Week, the Student Publications
and Radio (SP&R) Committee named
Tom Lenk and Anne Rawland as 5&3
editors for first and second semesters,
respectively. Since then a controversy
has arisen as to the legitimacy of
SPhR’s choice of Rowland over John
Mandel, the other candidate for
second semester.

In a letter sent to all three ape
plicants, SPtrR gave three primary
reasons for their choice of Rawland
over Mandel, First, Mandel will be off
campus first semester and the com-
mittee “feels the newsmagazine will
benefit if the second semester editor is
an active stall member during the fall
semester.“ The second reason cited in
the letter is “both Mandel and
Rowland have had equal experience
with campus Dublications . , . " Third,
the letter states, “Rawland’s
philosophy oi what the SM} should be
more nearly reflected that of the cam-
pus community.”

These three reasons, along with
several other extenuating factors, are
being questioned by Dan Flynn (std;
editor, fall '79) and Andrew Schultz
(present editor), Bath support Mandel
and are working on his behalf in an at
tempt to gain a review of the SPSzR
decision. Meanwhile, most members
of SP&R feel they have acted corrects
ly. Pam Hulnick, chairperson. suited,

' “I really do [eel that we made the cor-
Eect decision and I am willing to stand
y it”
The controversy heated up con-

raised by the two editors.

Flynn and Schultz contend that the
committee is ignoring past decisions
by citing the fact that Mandel will be
off campus first semester as a reason
for their decision. Their letter stated:
“The last four spring editorshlps show
that this has not been a committee
priority, and to use it as the commit
tee's most important criterion ior
selecting Rawland is obviously ten-
uous.” (The past tour spring stalls
have seen an editor, two associate
editors, and a news editor returning
from London.)

Mandel adds that he thinks this
issue should not be given much impor-
tance. “There are only a few major
issues each semester and l certainly
would hear about them even it I were
in London."

Pam llulnick and Mary Ruth Yoe
(another member of SP&R and editor
of The Grinnell Magazine) felt that
Mandel‘s absence would hurt the con-
tinuity oi the SM}. “I'm not sure how
often continuity is important in the
decision making process, however,
this year it seemed important,” stated
Yoe. She felt that Anne’s presence on
campus first semester would be
beneficial as an aide to Lenk. for
herself, and to the quality of the paper
during her term as editor second
semester. “It appears that the com—
mittee feels this issue was not enough
to warrant a review , . . I feel the
committee has made a responsible
decision," Yoe said.

Hulnick felt that there was the

 

Yoez” It appears the committee feels this issue

was not enough to warrant a review..."

Hulnick:

“I really do feel that we made the correct

decision and I am willing to stand by it.”

 

siderably last Monday when Schultz
and Flynn read a letter to the SPGtR
committee asking for a review cone
sideration. The committee, later
meeting in private executive session,
denied the review appeal with no
'6discussion of the substantive points

potential for Mandel to “get slightly
out of touch with campus issues," and
thus felt that continuity would be
preserved with Rawland as editor.
The second major issue now being
discussed is the differences between
the two candidates journalistic exe

perlences. An amended memo, sent a
week after the first memo declaring
the decision, admitted that Mandel
has had more direct experience with
the 5&8, but added that his and
Rawland’s “overall experience, in-
cluding high school, are comparable."

Mandel has had two years ex-
perience as a high school journalist.
At Grinnell, he has been a stall
reporter for four semesters and spent
half a semester as a senior contributor
and one and one-half semesters as
news editor. Mandel believes he
”knows about the technical processes
of the paper," and is journalistically
“more diverse than Anne, who is more
news—oriented."

Anne worked for two years on her
high school paper, editing it the se»
cond year, which provided her with
“practical experience.” Last year, as
a freshman, Anne says she “got con-
crete experience as a stati reporter,"
She feels that she became familiar
with the campus then and through
other means, such as her work wiﬂi
MOBE, SP&R, and the Finance Com-
mittee. “Yes, it’s been a while since I
had practical experience as an editor
. . that‘s why I didn’t want to be editor
first semester,” admits Rawland. She
plans to work for Lenk first semester
next year in preparation for assuming
duties in January. But, she notes, ”It
was up to SPhR to decide if l Could do
it."

Hulnick said that SP&R did not
discuss candidates’ journalistic
qualifications in detail because their
past experience was “expressed in
their application." Hulnick believes
they were both equally qualified.
“Both have served as editors and
reportersiwe like to see experience,
but not only in terms of years," she
said. Huinick feels that the number of
years of service could not be the
“overriding qualiﬁcation used by the
committee."

Flynn and Schultz believe the come
mittee has created an “air of uncer-
tainty." They state that years of pro
ven experience and competence
should be primary qualifications and
that the selection of Rawland is un-
warranted because the committee did
not examine any of Rawlands work
either for the SdrB or her high school
paper. In their letter to SPtrR they
asked the question or a hypothetical
statier: “Why should I work my way
up through the stair, gaining the
necessary experience to function as
ShB editor, when all these qualificae
tions may be ignored by the soon
committee?”
