.Vandalism as healthful sport

'After reading Wally Walker’s
ridiculous and half-baked letter to the
editor in last week’s 5&3. I was ex-
ceedingly pleased that he ls being
replaced as Dean. Wally, i hope you
,do shut up and fade away lor the next
eleven years because your scurrllous
and archaic attack on Vandalism
betrays an ap alling ignorance and
lack of sensit' ty toward contem-
porary college students, which totally
disqualifies you from making any
meaningful contribution to higher
education. Maybe you could find a
place at Oral Robert or Bob Jones
University, but no administrator who
fails to understand the phenomenon of
vandalism (and even partake a little)

Sure, mere may be a few nerds,
geeks, and social misiits who went to

but for the most‘part vandalism is
pervasive and omnipresent on the
Grinnell campus. ll you want vandals,
Wally, look around—everybody does
it.

But why is everybody doing it now,
when vandalism has been around in
one form or another since the fall of
the Roman Empire? The reasons of

The scurrilous and archaic attack on

and lack of sellsiliu‘ty toward

contemporary college students.

dalism is not a rare product of ex

the work of a small group oi warped

Frantically searching for signposts
on the road oi life, we seek meaning
and significance in our classes, in our
social life, in Benny’s, and in political
action; but not even our professors, or
peers, the world's most efficient
waitress, nor Gregg Edwards has any
answers. Moreover, even while we are
set adrift in the trackless terrestrial
emer which surrounds our lives. we
are bombarded with demands and re
quirements from every quarter:
papers due, exact change laundry
machines, room draw, and Dave Mc-
Connell's meal survey. Faced with
thcsc insistent hammcrrblows pound-

that the average Grinnell student
yearns to escape from the alienating,
strait-jacketing constraints oi the
everyday world and seek roiugc in one
where the only laws are those or pro

stand why we drop everything we‘re
doing when a iriends knocks on our
door and suggests, “Wanna roll some
manhole covers down the loggia

Yet, even though vandalism provides
us with a muchrneeded release of ten-

critics attack it as a Seihnduigellt Mev
