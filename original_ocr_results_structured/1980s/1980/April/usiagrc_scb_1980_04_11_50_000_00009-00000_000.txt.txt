Another concern of the Women's
roup is women’s health care. A clinic
oviding gynecological services staff-
I by women is hard to find in Grin-
ll. Strong efforts were made to
r'ng a clinic to Grinnell on a monmly

to clinic felt this would be impossi-
e. We will still run two more trips to

A new area this year has been work
ward the beginning of a women’s
udies program. If a student here
ishes to pursue such a program or
ceive recognition for work in this

-ea, usually an independent major
ust be declared, Several difficulties
'ise here, one of which is that there
e few courses which will apply

ational iniormation on the status at
omyn, lesbians, and gays in the
nited states. This iniormation is
nared and discussed, and action is
.ken when appropriate.

When possible, we have people some

rare with us about his experience
ith the Goddess religion. We also try
nd support the other womyn's tune
ons on campus, making them known
the town womyn as well.
In general, the purpose oi the group
to be a place where other lese
tan/feminists can contact womyn
ho share similar ideologies. It is also
place for gaining information on the
any issues pertaining to one‘s sex»
lity.

typograhical error.

k, April l lfl980

directly, A women's studies program
set apart from the rest of the cur-
riculum would not be advantageous.
Instead, we would like to see the
women’s perspective integrated into
iields such as literature, history, art,
sociology, and music, where it has
been omitted in the past.

The Women‘s Group supports other
groups on campus such as: the con-
sciousness raising groups, the les-
bian/feminist group, and the group
formed to take action against the pro-
blem caused by recent sexual assaults
and harassmenis, even though we
may not be directly involved in them.
The last of these groups was responsi-
ble for the seminar on selfrdefense and
will bring in people from a rape ad
vocacy center to conduct a seminar on

steps to take after a rape or assault
has occurred. Hopefully, this group
will also sponsor a panel discussion on
rape. The Women’s Groups’ response
to this issue was to help set up the
Escort Service which was suggested
by some oi the participants. This will
be in effect through the end of the
semester.

The Wumen’s Group is not a mili-
tant one. Our members are diverse-
veterans and new members, men a.“
women, seniors and fresh, Our beliefs
and commitments to feminism are as
diverse as we are and some members
combine a commitment to Christianity.
with feminism. We all share the belief,
however, that women are people and
are a majority group that should not
be treated like a minority.
