Student workers receive wage b

by Ellen Heath

Since October 1, student workers on
campus have been receiving the federal
minimum wage. They had previously
been paid only as percent at the
minimum wage.

The increase is a result of a law pass»
ed by Congress last September which
said that all colleges must pay the lull
minimum wage to their students on
work study. Two types oi student jobs
exist at Grinnell: basic jobs, such as
library and Physical Education Coma
plex work; and technical jobs, ins
eluding Food Service and work at the

Forum desk.
People with technical jobs are paid 10

cents more than those in basic jobs, but
both will receive the increase. Students
had been getting $2.64 and $2.75 per
hour but are now being paid $3.10 and
$3.20. In January, the minimum wage
will go up to $3.35 and students will be
paid 33.35 and $3.45, respectively.
According to Wally Walker, exV
eculive vicespresident, Grinnell wanted
to raise the wages last summer, but the
federal government, which subsidizes

the raise.

Dick V05, assmtant director of Ad-
missions and Student Financial Aid,
said that the college thought the new
law would go into enect next year in
stead of immediately. Grinnell was
notified about the third week in October
that the law was effective as of Oct. 1
The student wages budgeted for this
year, then, did not include the extra
amount needed for the increase.

Campus employers expressed some
concern that they would exceed their
budgets and would have to cut the hours

of their employ es. In a notice sent out
last week, how r, Walker told lheni
not to worry, ause the college will
cover any deficit spending related to
the wage increase. Students may cons
tinue to work their regular hours and
receive the lull minimum wage.

The iederal law applies only to the
students on work study because only
they are federally Subsidized. The other
students at Grinnell are also receiving
the increase, though, which is paid in
full by the college, No social security
payments or taxes will be deducted
from any student wages.

Sexism continues at colleges

"Things are getting better" is often
the response one hears to complaints of
sexism. But according to a recent Ford
Foundation report, women‘s situation
on campus is delinetly not getting bet»
ter. And it may be getting worse.

The report by Margaret Berger notes
that Virtually every claim or sex
discrimation brought against a college
or university has failed. Too, large difs
terences persist between men's and
women's salaries, and only a relative
handful of women have been granted
tenure. Added together, these trends
led Berger to conclude that institutions
or higher learning can be unilormly
characterized as "bastlons of sex
bias,”

Even Title IX hasn't been of much
help, the report says. Passed'in 1972.
the law was intended to ban sex
discrimination in education programs
receiving federal aid. But in 1980, eight
years later, not a single school’s federal
funds have been Cut 0“ because of sex
discrimination.

Future claims of discrimination
might be even harder to prove, the
report says because "the opposition
has gotten i s act together." Employers
are now "lighting every step of the
way, while conceding nothing."

it looks like Virginia Slims has it all
wrong,Womenaln'tcomealong way at
all, baby.
