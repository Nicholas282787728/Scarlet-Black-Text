Heath Brothers in Roberts

The Heath Brothers Quintet has been
termed as the “tightest, best-rehearsed
jazz ensemble to come along” Since the
Modern Jazz Quartet ﬁve or six years
ago. The MJQ included Percy Heath for
22 years, and after its dispersal, Percy
teamed up with brother Jimmy to form
the Heath Brothers Quintet.

Percy is the distinguished bassist of
the group, Jimmy is the multistalented
reedsman (playing tenor and soprano
sax, and flute), Stanley Cowell is Simp~
ly one of the genres best pianists, and
guitarist Tony Perrone and drummer
Akira Tana, although less well-known,
display the reason for their inclusion in

this excellent company at musicians
after only a few bars

Excellent reviews of their concerts
and albums have been written up in
Down Bcal magazine, Billboard's
Magazine, and various newspapers:
The Heath Brothers have been said to
“weave smoothness, dignity, and class
into their act", they are “articulate
spokesmen for jazz,” and their two
latest albums, In Motion and Live At
The Public Theatre, have received
much acclaim from critics.

The Heath Brothers does not require
tickets for admission and performances
will be at s and 9:30 pm saturday in
Roberts Theatre —— not South Lounge

An introduction to the world of liberal arts ,

Let me bug". by stating my purpose
here. 1 am addressing these words to
that persecuted group of natural
science majors popularly called Pre-
Meds, lcome not to ri 'Cule, but to offer
you a helping hand. This helping hand is
ready to open the door to the "wonder-
ful World of liberal arts." Your adviser
has no doubt extolled the Virtues of a
"liberal education" to you ill those
semiannual conferences know as pre-
registration These meetings are the
scourge of the Pre-Medi More than one
adviser has thrown a monkey wrench
into artiully wrought plans to take an
all-Bio course load. Don’t blame them.
This is their iob They only want to
broaden your academic horizon; to
iorce down your throat a "liberal
education." Perhaps the word
“liberal" is the problem here.
Anathema in politics, it is becoming
justly feared in other areas, like higher
education, Let's start talking about
striving for a "‘moderate‘ education,
and explore some oi the more
" oderatea

souomu A good place to start,
as it serves as a sort or bridge between
your interests and what are known as
the "radical arts": Classms and
Literature. The purpose of this held ape
parently is to teach you what you
already know. You will learn that the
ghetto is an unsound environment for
impressionable youngsters. Heriun ad-

diets and freewheeling pimps are
among the worst role models ior giited
youths. Take a stab at this discipline,
Mr, or Ms, PrerMed,ye1 take a word oi
advice here. You are probably qmte
good with ligures and painfully aware
of the cost oi tuition at Grinneli. But
remember, the Pre-Med who computes
down to the last dollar the cost or his
lour credits oi Sociology is doing
himself no favor.

ENGLISH LITERATURE: No doubt
this field does involve the study of a
"bunch of sissy poems," still, more
than one male Pre Med has scored
points with attractive women in singles
bars by dropping such phrases as ob
jective correilative ' or poulter 5
measure This is one big reason why it
is wise to know something at the
"liberal arts." Otherwise scornful
members oi the opposite sex may warm
up it they think that you are possessed
of a truly "liberal education ” Don't be
afraid to speak boldly about works that
you scarcely know. But be careiul.
Choose lesserrknown works for this pur
pose. You should be aware thal no one
has actually read Shakespeare's Titus
iiiitironiciis.

CLASSICS: Along with Arl History.
often considered to be the most
”radical" oi the "liberal arts." Can't
you Just picture handtuls ot dry-eyed
scholars meeting to discuss the ideas oi
people iiho have been dead and gone {or

two thousand years? Preposterous as'
this admittedly sounds, there are some
hearty laughs to be had in reading
about the religious beliefs of these
primitive and obsure peoples. They call
this "Mythology." You will read about
the big tough guy Achilles sulking in his
tent like some two-year-old People get
turned into all kinds oi objects in these
stories, also. Note: Around pre-
registration time. more than one Pre-
Med has agreed to lake “Ciceronian.
Prose and Poetry" only to collapse, ap-
parently helpless, at the loosball table
that same night.

ART HISTORY: ”I don‘t know what
good art is, but I do know what I like-’2
Admittedly, this is the only sane ap
proach to art criticism, but some
fellows over in the Fine Arts building
seem to think that they know the dif-
ference between good and bad art.
Some key words to remember here are:
"Italian Renaissance Art"7a style
created by a group of dissolute Floren~
tine friars back in the soscalled “Quab
trocento"; “impressionism” _
something about the eiiects of light on
French people; "Cubism”inude-
women who might as well have clotha
on. You'll be in the know if you can tell
the difference between f‘Old” and
"Modern" art, These are quite easy to’
tell apart, Fellows like Titian apparent-
ly had little patience ior huge cans
vasses depicting luna sandwiches. 1
