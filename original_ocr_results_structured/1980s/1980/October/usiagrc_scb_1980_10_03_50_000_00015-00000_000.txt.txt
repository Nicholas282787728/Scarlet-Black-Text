An alternative to everyone

It will be a curious spectacle; by re
cent count, at least onerthird of the
voters in this fall's presidential election
will not be supporting a candidate. in-
stead, they will cast their ballots
against his opponents.

“For a number of years I have walks
ed into a polling booth holding my nose,
trying to figure out which is the lesser
of two evils and usually guessing
wrong To me, that is a situation that
demeans democracy.” So says Barry
Commoner, biology professor. author
(The Politics of Energy). and presidenr
tial candidate on the Citizens' Party
ticket

The Citizens‘ Party was formed,
barely a year ago, to combat the
degradation of the electoral process by
the major political parties. The elec-
torate is offered little choice on most
issues by the three leading presidential
contenders; Carter, Reagan, and now,
even Independent John Anderson differ
only in the degree of their stances, not
in the stance itself. All three. for exams
pie, support nuclear power. Likewise,
each has a plan that increases defense
spending, while reducing funds for
social programs so that a tax cutcan be
enacted. The Citizens' Party offers an
alternative to this kind of homogeneous
thinking, “an alternative to everyone,
including Anderson," Commoner says,

Not that the Citizens' Party is merely
an ambiguous "alternative" to the ma
jor parties, criticizing the frontrrunning
candidates while offering no solutions
of its own, Commoner and the Citizens'
Party provide unrepentantly different,
clear. and specuic answers to the real
issues facing the American public,
Democrats, Republicans. and in-
dependents alike tell us that little can
be done about the continuing arms race
and renewed cold war. that inflation is
caused by an unbalanced federal
budget; that humail services must he
cut so that the Defense Department's
budget may be raised; and that our
power must be generated by nuclear
fuel. The Citizens" Party disagrees

This disagreement with the major
party candidates is at a very fundamen-
tal level For example, these
“establishment candidates" say that
inflation is caused by an unbalanced na~
tionai budget and certain tax policies
unfavorable to investment Sidney
Lens. writing in The New Republic,
describes the “merry~gorround
scenario. "First there is doublerdigit
inilation, then the government causes a
recession in order to reduce inflation
and when the recesswn reaches a
danger point, the government otters a
tax cut . . . which re~stimulates double-
digil inflation." And so it goes on, as
Carter, Reagan, and Anderson would
have it.

The Citizens' Party, however, would
not have it this way. Commoner and
friends see that inflation is caused by
something more basic: government
spending on projects that deplete the
economy but add nothing to it, Huge
military expenditures, to the tune of a
current $150 billion a year, are a major
cause of inflation for this reason. We
are told by the powers that be that
defense-related spending provides jobs
and enhances national security; but
these claims are absurd. As our
arsenals increase. so do those of our
country's competitors. As for jobs,
what happens when the defense con-
tract runs out? Should yet another new
weapon be developed to keep those
workers employed?

The Citizens' Party calls for a halt to
this suicidal nuclear arms race. urging
the United State to initiate an im-
mediate international moratorium on
all phases of development and deploy-
ment of new nuclear weapons. Through
a competitive and anatagonistic arms
policy, our economy is sapped while we
become less, not more, secure This
situation should not continue; the
legitimate interest and security of the
American people must come before

those of the private corporate sector. ,

The Citizens' Party calls for a drastic
decrease in military expenditures, to
save both our economy and our world
from destruction.

Neither is our economy helped by a
continuing dependence ,on nuclear
power and on vanishing fossil fuel,
much of it imported. AS foreign oil
prices increase, so do our country's
