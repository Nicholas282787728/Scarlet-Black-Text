3. Clear difference’ in Senate Race

Mozambique, and Cuba; and federal
aid to New York City. Culver supported
all of these measures. Grassley also
sponsored legislation requiring an end
to deficit spending by the federal
government by 1991 and a hill to trim
$1.1 billion from the l980 budget in
areas of government film»making,
travel for bureaucrats, and overtime
for federal employees; both measures
which Culver opposed

Culver is very strong on environmen-
tal issues, having received a 9'] percent
rating for the period Wis-1900 from the
League of Conservation Voters.
Grassley received a 15 percent rating
for the same period, the lowest of any
Iowa congressman. One bill which he
opposed would require the establish»
ment of evacuation plans for areas
around nuclear power plank before the
plants could be licensed. Culver voted
yes on the proposal. (The vote occurred

John Culver
after the Three Mile Island incident.)

Culver has also accused Grassley of
"flip-flopping” on several issues, most
notably defense programs and the
ERA. Grassley voted against bringing
the ERA to Vote in the state legislature,
then voted for the ERA, and later voted
against extending the ratification
deadline in the House. Culver voted for
the federal ERA and the ratification»
deadline extension. Another example is
Social Security, an issue on which
Culver has charged Grassley with
misrepresenting his position to gain
votes. He points out that Grassley op-
posed the Social Security tax increase
in 1977, then praised the move in the
Oct. 10, 1979 Congressional Record, and
has sponsored three hills since 1977 to
expand Social Security benefits.

The lowa senatorial race this year of-
fers a clear difference between can—
didates The incumbent, John Culver. is
a Democrat with a strong liberal
reputation and the Republican
challenger, Charles Grassley. has ,ties
to the “New Right" and the John Birch
Society. Since Grassley has also been
serving in Congrss, in the House of
Representatives, voters have an oppor-
tunity to directly compare the records
or the two men on current issues.

I; Grassley has a record of opposing in-
creases in government spending. He op
posed institution of a multi—billion
dollar Social Security tax increase; a
$2,900 pay increase for members of
Congrm; construction of a $138 million
Senate office building; foreign aid to
,Vietnam, Angola, Panama, Laos.

Grassley also opposed legislation re-
quiring chemical manufacturers to test
chemicals that may pose a risk to
public health or the environment before
putting them on the market and spon—
sored legislation to shift the burden of
proof in litigation from the citizen to the
government agency. Culver took the op-
posite stand in both cases.

Another issue on which the two men
differed was common situs picketlng, in
which a strike by one union can shut
down an operation even if other unions
want to continue work. Grassley oppos-
ed it; Culver was in favor. Also, in a
rating by the US, Student Association,
based on educational affairs, the draft;
and health care, Culver received 100
percent while Grassley was given only
a 19 percent rating.
