Audubon mimics Phoenix

by Steve Burnett

“What do you know about the
Audubon Society?"

”They like birds."

Two sophomores ,~ Laura Jackson and
Ann Kosek, have taken up the task of
building the Grinnell Audubon Society
beyond that outdated image.

in the mid-'70’s, a Society president,
Dave Nordstrum, generated college
and community involvement through
massive advertising and undying
energy. Many oi the members belonged
to an Audubon co—op, called Bird House

But one year most of the residents or
Bird House Went to Costa Rica, then
Nordstrum graduated, and by 1979 the
Grinnell Audubon Society had plunged
into oblivion.

Now, Jackson and Kosek are trying to
regain recognition and support. Solar
ﬂ’lis year, the only activities have been
the monthly meetings and two bird
walks, but the ofﬁcers indicated that
more is on the way.

They are expanding the Society to
cover the entire spectrum of en-
Vironmenlal issues. The club is working
to create long-range activites that will
provide college credit for participants.

The Society is student run and the
success of the club depends on who gets
involved and to what extent. Biology
Professor Vern Dirkey, the faculty
sponsor, and biology Professor Karl
DelAng help and provide equipment
when asked, but DeLong stressed that
they do not push anyone into member»
ship or push the club into activities.

DeLnng said the Society can provide
a valuable service to the college and the
community and can be enjoyable [or
ﬁle members; but Jackson and Kosek
need help from the student body.

This highlights the main obstacle
they face: a shortage oi members. The
club has a mailing list of people in the
college and the community who have
shown an interest in the Audubon Socie-
ty, but these people are not getting in-
volved. Jackson said that students tend
to shy away li‘orn longrterm time
consuming activities.

So far, she Said, the Society is not ter-
ribly timerconsuming. To become in-
volved, one simply has to show up at the
meetings (held monthly except this
month because at break) The meetings
consist at a speech or lilms and a
discussion at possible activities. Kosek
stressed that the Society is open to sug»
gestions and newbie in its times for ac»
tivities. She said people need not devote
their entire life to the club to make a
contribution,

DeLong noted an irony concerning
the Society. He said when he takes his
biology labs into the wilderness. the
Students come back saying they had a
great time and would like to do it again
He pointed out‘that the Audubon Socie-
ty's outings consist or practically the
same things as these labs. Partitipants
do not even have to take notes or be
graded, he added, yet students are
afraid to commit themselves to an en-
joyable organization,
