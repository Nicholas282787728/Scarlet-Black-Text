The ﬁve year plan

’ The history of Grinnell College, like
the greater history around us, is often
cyclical. In the early ’70s, students ac-
tivism in one year was followed by ex-

, haustion and apathy in the next. Wor~
ries over the athletic program (is it dy-
ing; is it too strong?) have appeared at
greater intervals. Occasionally, ques-
tions 0! academic reorganization have
persisted for several years. These ques-
tions have been crucial in the evolu-
tionary process of campus life. And
changes have come hand in hand with
our growth. As we enter the ’808 our
priorities have again been challenged
'a'nd certain questions have been raised.
in response, I would like to examine the
situation and explore several proposals
for change.

this way we are ingrained with the
habits of our literary masters.

abolition of the core curriculum, the F

Grinneliians switched their emphasis to
individually tailored programs.

, But the expectations of the planners
have been distortedor ignored by an in-
creasing number of students. While it is
true that the more creative options still
exist. it is also true that few students
can be homered with such trivolity. Our
concerns have changed. With a majori-
ty of the cultural battles won, we have
turned our thoughts outward toward

we are mistaken. Pre»prolessionalism

Our mistake has been in distorting
the claims of the future, the claims of
reality. Fear is the key. it is rear which
has driven us into the narrow confines
of our chosen disciplines. And it is this

its timeless and practical qualities.

comlorts to be had in a world without
nuance.

Despite such observations we plunge
ahead along the narrow path The cura
ricular victories oi the late 'SDs have
become our deicat. Without re»
quirements it is possible to take 100
credits, and even. 124, without ever see»
ing a lab or a problem set. And although
it is more difficult for science majors to
take a similar course, I am sure that
many flirt with their 92 credit divismnal
limit.

I would like to call the college to an
education based on measured thought,
rather than mindless production, It is
time, Ithink, to consider distributional
requirements. I leave the discussion oi
their parameters to the community.
Whether we drag ourselves through 12,
is, or even 20 credits of a foreign
discipline is not important; recognizing
the necessity oi such action is.

At the same time we must consider
our need [or a core curriculum. After
our tutorials, Humanities 101 and 140
are most often mentioned. To these I
would like to add Philosophy, Statistics,
and perhaps Calculus. Arrangements
lor two lwrlevel science courses should
also be worked out. And, almough two

gramming. Indeed, learning BASIC
may be our best way oi bridging the gap
between science and literature. For
solving a given problem Is only half the
battle; communicating it in a clear and
fluent manner is also required.

Beyond these requirements a holistic
approach is needed. Faculty advisers
should attend workshops on academic
counselling. Better entry-level courses
should be designed for non—science ma-

’jors. Most important, however, is the

role which each student must play. in-
deed. sufficient ellorts by the student
body could ease this need for re-
quirements.
