I jerk and kick trying to get on my

me back under the blacksplitting lamp

Ahh. It lelt good to be around little

To the Editor: In “The Five Year
Plan," Steve Holdridge asserts that
students are losing the skill oI coins
mynicatlrig in an eloquent and precise
manner. He implies that he is a good
writer and can counsel the rest of us
poor slobs who are not {allowing his
course. Yet he does not write eloquently
arid precisely. l-lis article is loaded with
language errors that make his point
less clear.

When I say Holdridge makes
language errors, I do not mean gram-
mar mistakes (although they are abun-

pompous uses ol words or jargon or ad-
ded syllables.

their parameters to the community."
Parameters are properties that deter-
mine the characteristics of something.
That word does not belong in that
sentence. Guidelines could be used, but
it has only two syllables and
parameters has lour.

My favorite is, "To pre-meds, math
majors, and the rest ol your llk . . . '3"
