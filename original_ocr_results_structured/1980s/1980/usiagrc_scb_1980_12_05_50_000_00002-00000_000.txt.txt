What is the S&B?

The 58:13 serves a dual function on this campus. It is both the vehi-
cle for news on campus and a place for people to learn. The second
function is not an excuse for mistakes, but it is something which
should be pointed out to those who criticize the 58:13 for not being a
“professional” publication.

The learning aspect of the 8818 has been especially important this
year For the first time in many years, none of the chief editors have
served in a major position on the 5&8 before their present position,
With no guide from previous years, we have spent the semester lear-
ning from each other. Some new things were tried. Some worked
well, others failed miserably. All have contributed to the learning
process. The mistakes of this semester have been the basis for plan~
ning changes in the semesters to come, and that’s what learning is
really all about.

One more note: this is the last issue of the 5&8 for this semester,
The next issue will come out on Jan. 23, the first week of next
semester.

To our mail patrons

Those of you on our mailing list should have received several back
issues of the 58:3 in a bunch recently. We apologize for any inconve
nience this may have caused. Due to computer problems, we were
unable to get our lables until this past week and couldn’t mail the
papers out.
