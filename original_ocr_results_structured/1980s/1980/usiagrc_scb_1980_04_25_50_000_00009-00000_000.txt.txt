over to the audience."

One of the elements of the play
which gets the audience involved is
the country-bluegrass oriented music.
The classic bluegrass adapted for the
Show will be played by a small band
made up of Evan Solomon on piano;
Alice Washawski and Patty Isaacson,
violin; Bill Ogilvie, guitar; Andy
Moon, string bass; and Terry Steele
on banjo.

Czechowski concludes that this is
“not the kind of show that people sit
back and feel they have to learn

Woodstock is Woodstock! This is the
film record of the three-day event that
was called the “Woodsth Music and
Art Fair" and occurred over the
weekend of August i5-l7, 1969. The
film includes interviews and some
great concert footage of bands like:
The Who, sly and the Family Stone,
the one and only Jimi Hendrix, and all
the other greats. While the tilm is
longish, it is great tun and an expert
ment with wide-screen/split—screen

something or tax their brains to figure
out what it means. It’s just plain fun
and guaranteed to get your hands
clappin' and your feet stompin’."

He adds that he is very impressed
with the “cast, which hasn't backed
down nor slacked off on energy. Pear
ple on stage are having fun with what
they're doing. They’re creating their
own fun and energy and it’s very cone
tagious."

The music is by Robert Waldman
and the book and lyrics by Alfred
Uhry. James Fudge is the musical

processes. A must lor all you rock and
sixties fans.
