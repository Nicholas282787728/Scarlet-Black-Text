from the editor

Hello, and welcome back to Grinnell Now that registration
is over the freshmen are becoming settled and establishing
themselves as a part of the campus community. In this issue
of the S&B we hope to help acquaint them with their new
home, and let the rest of you catch up on the changes that
have been made since you were here last.

Two interviews highlight the Campus section this week;
Anne Rawland discusses academic policies with the new
Dean of the Faculty, Catherine Frazer and the leaders of the
SGA are introduced by Winston Kreuter.

In a lighter vein, Projects Editor Rich Letchinger presents
his “Grinnell Defense” It is designed to help the freshmen
confronted by people who want to know what town Grinnell
College is in and should prove interesting to upperclassmen
as well

One more note, we’ll be looking for letters again this year.
If you have wisdom to share, or just something that you
would like to get off your chest, write it up and put it in our

' boxi It’s in the section with the faculty boxes, just after the
25. Longer selections may be run as open Space articles All
submissions should be typed and double—spaced

Let us know how you like this issue (let us know especially
if you don’t like it), and what other things you would like to
see in the S&B,

Have a good semester.
