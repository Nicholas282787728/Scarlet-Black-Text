Wardell -ey and Teddy Edwards,

It was with tho Wardell Grey
Quintet that Farmer made his recur»
ding debut. The album introduced his
own composition, “Farmer's Market,"
which has since become a classic.

in 1952, rarmcr joined Lionel
Hampton. “I was glad of the opporr
tunlty,” says Farmer, whose own in
trospective personality lit in surpris-
ingly well with the explosive cxtrovert
that is llamp. “He never pressed me
to bcCOmL' an exhibitionist or to latch
onto his brand of Showmanship, He
respected my reelings, and he always
let me be myself "

When he left Hampton in 1953,
Farmer freelaneed for a while, play
ing with Lester Young, Coleman
Hawkins, Theloniuus Monk, Charles
Mingus, and Art Blakely He appeared
more irequently and with more pro-
minence, notably during a concert at

Frill the Cat
Director: Ralph Bakshi
Warner Brothers
Color/78 min/Rated X
Showing: Friday, 10:00, ARH; sun-
day, 10:00, ARH

The only way to understand or
believe what the film Fritz the Cal is
about, is to see it. “Fritz" is a feature
length cartoon which was an early
project of Ralph Bakshi,who has since
mellowed out and is responsible for
Wizards (seen at Grinnell last
semester) and more recently, The
Lord or the Rings

The film takes place around New
York City and at New York University
as it follows the fast life of Cool dude,
college dropout, Fritz Bakshi pulls all
the tricks in this huge satire of
American society. All the characters
are played by animals, yet Bakshi has
cleverly given them all human traits,
Hippies and teenie hoppers as well as
most ethnic groups are targets in this
Bakshi satire,
Fritz the Cat is the kind of cartoon you
won't see on the tube on Saturday

Producer: Elia Kazan

Director: Elia Kazan
Cinematographer: Ted McCord

Cast: James Dean, Julie Harris, Ray-

Carnegie Hall with the New York
Philharmonic. Around that time, he
organized a quintet with Gigi cryee.
He also periormed with'the groups led
by Horace Silver and Gerry Mulligan.
About that time, Farmer switched to
the iluegelhorn “The instrument has
a wider range than the trumpet," he
explains, “and it helps me to express
myseli in a truer iashion. The first
timel tried it, I liked the tone, the
warmth, the depth 1 got out of it. In

the lower register, 1 can play it more .

eitectively than the trumpet, And
when i want the brilliance and striden»
cy usually associated with that instru-
ment, all 1 have to do is shift to the
higher register.”

In 1968, he moved to Vienna per-
manently. “The scene had become so
bad in the states at that time, i just
wanted to concentrate on my music
without having to deal with the

hassles. Besides, in Europe, I also
found the kind of respect that comes
with art, and that made the whole dil-
terence.” Nonetheless, he retained a
foothold in the u.s., returning regular:
iy to appear at festivals and do club
dates around the country.

Lately, the Change in attitude
towards jazz in general and his music
in particular have caused him to have
second thoughts about staying in
Europe. “I feel very good about
what‘s happening here," he says. “So
much so, in fact. that I'm thinking
about reversing my way of living,
staying over here and going back to
Europe once in a while to tour," ’

Reflecting upon his career, Farmer
says with eoniidence, “As long as pear
ple are able to play and make some‘
kind of communication with their au~'
dience, there has to be a iuture for '
jazz." - '
