Waltzes will he inverted. in past years
the traditional tall waltz was held in
Darby Gymnasium and included a live
band, whereas the spring waltz was
held in the Quad dining hall and the
music was provided through a taped
sound system. Because many of the tall
waltz hands have been of poor quality
and the attendance low, the SGA decid-
ed to wait until spring to have a band
waltz.

Herricks's gradually deteriorating cons

knew we were going to have to get into
it but the more we looked at it, the more
we saw that needed to be done," said
Executive Vice-President Waldo
Walker.

"Rather than having two speakers in.
(mm there's a series oi speakers going
around the ceiling and surrounding the
audience with sound," said Dave Buck,
KDlC station manager. The new
distribution of sound is "more
intimate" he said, because the
speakers are not highly Visible as they
formerly were. Increased wattage
gives the new system a cleaner sound
with less hiss. The replacement of large
microphones with smaller ones allows
the audience a better View of lecturers.

All at Herrick's pews were taken out,
cleaned, and varnished. “We wanted to
put pads on the seats but the music peo
ple advised that it might allect the
acoustics," noted Walker. The chapel,
known lor its excellent acoustics, re-
quired no alterations or improvements
on the sound in the building, Wooden
ceiling beams were dusted and given an
Dll treatmelit and a coat of sealer was
put on the tloor under a new carpet.

"It's as thorough a job oi the renovar
tlon ol a building as we could possibly
do," Said Walker, "especially because
nothing new was added except lor the
carpet and three light lixtures in the en-
tryway which couldn't be restored."
