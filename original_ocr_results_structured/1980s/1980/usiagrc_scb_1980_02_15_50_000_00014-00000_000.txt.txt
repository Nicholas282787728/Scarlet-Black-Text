norance as it relates to the idea of
racialsupremacy, his works were
among the first to employ the scien-
tific method in bringing to (arm the.
history oi the negrojn the United
States and elsewhere. The Association
for the Study 01 Negro Life was
established to meet a special need {or
more understanding of a group which
had hitherto been misunderstood. The
Association was organized by Woodson
in Chicago on Sept. 9, 1915,with only
five persons. The purpose of this
undertaking was to preserve and
publish the records of the Negro so
that the race may not become a
negligible [actor in the thought of the
world. Currently, the Association is
putting much time and effort in the
oral history oi negro Americans. Some
of Carter G, Woodson‘s works include:

Toward a belligerent optimism

It’s late in the week and I've just
been informed that I have a column
due tomorrow as well as a {air-sized
paper for a notorious prof who shall
remain nameless. I’m not really
prepared for classes and I'll un-
doubtedly get roasted over the coals.
It‘s still damn cold out with spring
looking further and further away
every day. The last three or four class
assignments in three out oi four
classes have been reading selections
from' authors whose sole purpose in
life was to convince all of us that our
lives are purposeless. i probably won’t
be here next year as I'll he drafted,
and the year after that I’ll be killed in
action fighting Soviet troops over
some nameless piece of dust in the
Middle East. But even dying ior my
country will be meaningless since the
Russians can blow us up 40 times over
anyway. Whales and baby seals are
dropping like flies. Nuclear plans are
going to blow at any moment..Miilions
are starving in Cambodia, Nestles is
poisoning children, Apartheid is op-
pressing untold thousands. inflation is
,at an all time high, and on top of that
I can’t even afford to buy a rafﬂe
ticket (or the Loose Hall Ball.

But do i panic? Do i despair? Do I
decide that since life can only end in
death I may as well hasten the inn
cvltable? Maybe it I had any brains I
would. But fortunately (or uniorr
tunately) I’ve been able to light nil the
Apocalypse Mentality that is so
prevalent these days,

Basically, the Apocalypse Mentality
takes the term of a deep numbness in
the conscious mind accompanied by
the realization that you are not in con-
trol of your own life. Forces beyond
your control are moving you to an
unknown end away from where you
would like to be. Not only that, but

Woodson was also a con-
temporary oi Marcus Garvey. He
wrote:

“whatever may be said about
Garvey's mistakes, he cannot be
recorded in history as a fanatic or as
a too]. His claim to be recorded in
history lies in the fact that he at-
tracted a larger following than any
negro has developed in modern times."

Carter Godwin Woodson died in 1950.
His contributions to America are
celebrated and applauded during
Black History Month; a tribute to his

world into a decline that Will eventual

planet Earth.

These scenarios of death and
destruction have become integralil

lives. Pick up a newspaper and you
will see how prevalent this mentality

. is. The editors of last weekend’s

Chicago Tribune apparently felt that a
reporting of the dedication, faith,
grace, and power of Winter Olympic
athletes needed to be balanced in the
next section by a detailed guide to
every terrorist group to ever send a
threatening letter. The huge headline
read something like “A World in Tur-
moil,” and the article insinuated that
one wrong move on the part of Puerto
Rican nationalists could send us all
spinning into Goiterdamerung.

But, of course, this is news People

Traditionally, Black History Week
occurs in the second week of February
to emphasize two important men in

people on the history of Blacks. It is
more of an attempt to raise the level

was “OK So Far—But It's Not Over
Yet." That attitude is just garbage.
We‘re all waiting for the other boot to
fall. if something good is happening
now, it's because something awful is
going to happen later, In the {ace of
an uncertain iuture we've become in
capable of enjoying the present and
we look longingly for the lost ideals of
the past. I'd like to make a case for
the present.

To me, as an 8 year old, watching
TV in 1968, the world was a series of
political assassinations, race riots,
overdoses, and war footage. No thank
you, I don't want to go back to that
regardless of the overtlowings of
Peace and Love of the time, And yes.

do have reason to believe it's not going
to be the worst 01 all possible worlds
even it it's not the best. But, iii any
case, it is only through the present
that I can deal with the future
anyway,

Unless we deal with the present as
best as we are able we are blowing
our chance for the future as well as ig~
noring the lessons of the past. We ig-
nore the present all too often around
here. We reject it every time we
dismiss our lives here as separate
from the “real world" and therefore
meaningless, We reject it every time
we dismiss our studies as meaningless
and inconsequential. studying Voltaire
won't halt nuclear arms proliferation,
so studying Voltaire is barren and
void. 1 get as mad at people who say
that as an English major I am ignore

do at people who say that an English
major can't become a corporate presi-
dent and make the big bucks
