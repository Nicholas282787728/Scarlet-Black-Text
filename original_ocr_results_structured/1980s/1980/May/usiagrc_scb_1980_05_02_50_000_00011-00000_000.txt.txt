This film can best be called charm-
ing. Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha
Mason give very nice performances in
this pleasant little Neil Simon script.
It is above all funny, funny, funny.
This is the perfect movie for finals
time; it requlres very little thought
and yet provides a great many laughs.
Be sure to catch the quiet Bogart take»
off by Dreyfuss. So get up and get
away to New York and someone else 5
problems it will cheer you up, give
you hope and if you cant stand the
end, you can go see the sequel recent-
ly released: CHAPTER TWO.

THE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE

This is another concert and escapist
film. See the Dead in action from the
time the truck rolls in until the time
they close down the show. Filmed over
live Dead concerts, this is a good
movle just to get high at and mellow
out with. The 20 minutes of animation
at the top of the film is talked about
constantly by those in the know (they
who have seen).

A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE
Director: Elia Kazan

Screenplay: Tennesse Williams, from
a play by Tennesee Williams

Cast: Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando,
Kim Hunter, Karl Maiden
1951/B&W/Unlted Artists

Friday, May 2, 10 pm, South Lounge;
Saturday, May 3, 10 pm, ARI-l

This is the screen adaptation (and
you can tell where the play was clean»
ed up for a general 1950’s audienee if
you know the play) of probably the '
greatest American play ever written.
Straight from its smash New York
Stage debut comes this magnificent
Tennessee Williams play directed by
Elia Kazan (East of Eden). While this
film is a bit on the heavier side, com-
pared to the rest of this weekend’s '
films, it is really one that should not
be missed. Brando . . .Wow! . , . has
been called the greatest American ace
tor to appear on stage or screen, in ’
many ways this is no exaggeration.
His Macho rendering of Stanley
Kowalski established a whole trendrin
American films. Additionally both
Kim Hunter and Vivien Leigh give ex-
cellent screen performances; both '
received Oscars for their work in this
film. As I mentioned before it is a bit
on the heavy side, but it is really
worth the trouble to see it, in spite or
the 16 finals you have coming up.
