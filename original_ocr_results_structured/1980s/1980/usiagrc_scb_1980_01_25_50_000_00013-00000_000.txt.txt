Iran, American students across the
country are protesting, and harassing
Iranian students. It has become an
“us” vs. ”them" phenomenon. that,
combined with a renewed public faith
in American government, signals a
revitalized sense of nationalism,

structure is gaining ground on this
campus. too, with respectable group
effort to raise funds for Cambodians, a
heartfelt need for many of the athletes
on campus to maintain their sense oi
iraternity and seliesteem in
deference to a strong anti-jock senti-
ment, and droves of gutsy young
Republicans, who, second only to the
gays who preceded them, are emerge
ing irom the closet in increasing
numbers.

The movies of the latter part of the
decade seem to be illustrating the
need for structure: the heroes of
“Manhattan" and ”10" indulge in the
fantasy life of the structureless 70's,
only to resolve that living a iantasy is
sheer disappointment. The heroes res
tain a fondness for the good ol' days.
With the theme Of Conrad's Heart of

Darkness, “Apocalypse Now" warns
of the horror that faces a su‘uctureless
society. And finally, the picture of the
year, “Kramer vs. Kramer,” shows us
that the old family structure is ob
solete, and must be replaced by a new
kind of structure .

i suppose the inevitable question
now is: Is this trend good or bad? My
answer will have to be neitheraor
both. not just to avoid the obvious pit-
fall of making such a value judge-
ment, but because I really think it is
neither or both. As a child of the 70’s I
like the idea of being yourself (in
theory, anyway), I am pleased to see
repressive structures fade away, and I
don't like Punk Rock. But I believe a
change is welcome now, The apauietic
generation served its purpose,
creating probably as much, if not
more, social change than its activist
60's counterpart. And, irankly, I
seriously question whether or not the
Me generation really “worked." Struc-
ture evolves for a purpose. It tells peo-
ple what to do and whether or not

they're doing it right. If often involves
unreal expectations (as with the
American Dream myth) but it does
provide tangible expectations, without
which people are often lost. Structure
provides a standard ior comparison
that allows one to measure personal
success. Without structure, people
have nothing to compare their lives to,
and my argument is that overall, peo-
ple need to compare. The stnic-
turelessness of the 70’s had its up-
ponents: a strengthened conservative
belt, Anita Bryant, and the tragic
resorting by so many to the structure
offered by fanatical religious cults.
Even Disco was a structured form,
complete with identity, uniform and
meeting places, although the emphasis
was basically Me ish.

So it s goodbye to what Don MacA
Clean called ‘a generation lost in
space," (what did we have, anyway? ‘
hoolahoops, the leisure suit,
disco—maybel won t miss the 70 s
alter all) and hello to a generation
found.

Bogota as fairyland...alid tragedy

Life in Bogota, Colombia is a series
of contrasts: they are everywhere. At
7:15 I leave the garish, very
American-looking middleclass apartr
merit, replete with red carpet, red
sofa, red cushions, red chairs, red
bedspread—and an all green dine
ingroom—and I descend into the fields
that sprawl, absurdly, in the very
heart oi the modern city. Beyond the
field, the morning sun dusts the smog
off the downtown skyline, and Im-
mediately behind that, majestic, specs
iacular, rise the omnipresent moun»
tains.

1 thread my way down the railroad
tracks, past the trash littered
shamelessly in all directions, past
homeless kids playing an improvised
game of soccer. past cows lazily chew-
ing cud. Then down busy streets,
dodging reckless drivers who
sideswipe occasional pack burros, past
grinning young men who whisper in
my ear, “Hola Mona," past dead dogs
and burning garbage. past construc~
tion workers who swing their
sledgehammers resolutely at
unyielding concrete, past a sleeping
beggar who uses his ruana for a bed
and the sidewalk for a pillow, past the
plush Hotel Hilton, With its attendants
with black top hats and gold-bordered
purple coattails, to the twentyrseventh
floor of the Barvarla building, where I
am not allowed to wear blue-Jeans.
and I teach English to the thirtyrfour
year old president oi a multimillion
peso iinance company, who, beiore he
was a busmessman, was studying to
be a Jesuit priest.

where the jabber oi English voices
can be heard irom every corner, pale~

seeking solace and familiarity,
anything that reminds them {0 the
good ole’ U.S. of A. I run into Julie. As
usual, she has a string of agitated
comments to make about the ins
credibly dirty buses. or what an in
credible rip-off it is that the school
doesn't make Xeroxed copies for us,
Or...l tune her out. I am reminded
again oi my iavorite line from a Lina

young, burgeoise European sunning
herself on the deck of a boat can’t get
her rum and coke, and she makes a
brilliant comment about “Worldwide
inefficiency."

“Well you know it's the Goddamned
Colombian inefficiency," 1 tell Julie.
grinning. It is my explanation for
everything. and does indeed account
ior just about every frustration, irom
broken telephones that are out for a
week, to busses that leave several
hours late (or crash into mountain-
sides). Julie, however, seems to miss
the humor oi my remarks.

I wait for' a bus to Lake me home for
lunch, the main meal of the day. I
already know exactly what awaits
me; rice and potatoes. iried bananas
and fried leathery meat, served up by
the maid who also gets the kids up for
school at 5:00 a.m.. and washes
clothes by hand until 10:00 at night,

Suddenly it begins to rain hard. in
two seconds I am drenched, blanketed
in grey water irom the grey clouds
breaking over the grey mountains onto

the grey, dirty city, and I watch the '
cold, unfriendly people fleeing in their
grey suits, their faces hidden by black
umbrellas. sigh. This is winter in
Bogota. I think longingly of my trip to
the Llanns, the flatlands, the savane
nah, only a iew hours from Bogota, -
where the sun shone bright and hot
and the countryside, as seen irom the .
dizzying height of a local water-tower
at sunset. extended in one direction as
far as one could see and farther, in~ ‘
credibly flat and filled with the lush
greens and yellows of tropical vegetar
tion. And on the other side, in the
distance, rose Hie mountains. Bogota
hidden among them, purple and blue-
in their magnificence, jutting into the
darkening orange-red sky...Colombia
is a fairyland and a tragedy.
