Chaplin reviewed

In The Kid. Charlie Chaplin is
described by angry police as a “little

mustache " This is the image Chaplin
initially presents us. But something
separates Chaplin from the usual
slapstick comic (indeed to call Chaplin

which The Kid was produced that this
something began to appear

In his early films, including the
rather late lilms shown last week,

comedian and the most outrageously
popular star in the movies, His style

sentimentality is redeemed by the dell

even the most tragic scenes. The pore

The Idle Class does not contain the

also interesting because there is inter

throughout and not all are slapstick In
addition, it is much more smoothly and
iiiieliigently constructed than his
earlier liims, making the comedy much
less forced.

These two lllms, then, show a pro-

become more assured technically, and
he begins, with The Kid, 3 new style
that will eventually lead him to such
heights as City Ligliis (October 4i and
The Gold rush (October 20).
