brellas or trinkets they have stolen or
made, past bookstalls, past lighted
restaurants playing the rhythmic Col-
ombian music. How different this fee]-

ing is from that of the Candeleria, the
old quarter. just a few short blocks
away. There, after getting out late at
night from a show or concert at the
Stately European Teatro colon, one
can wander the narrow quiet streets,
and the great lighted Plaza Bolivar,
450 years old, lined on all sides with
the beautifully dignified architecture
of Romanesque churches and govern-
ment buildings. i am shoved, suf»

My lovely amoeba friends rumble in

Everyone in Colombia has them:

The bus drops me off on Carrerra

more by the view I see every day.
There, in the distance, flanked on one
side by the darkened fields, and
silhouetted on the other by the silent
mountains, blaze and twinkle the
buildings of the modern city. It is
breathtakingly beautiful.

here). Worth noting is that such anti-
dualistic dualism is as American a

to side With us against our adver-
saries,

l’ve been notably unable to free my
mind of dualism and the reflection
thereupon during these past few weeks
of snowless Grinnellian tranquility.
During winter break the Grinnell cam-
pus resembles a student after 72 hours
of dexedrine and the final Final. After
a brief and unconvincing debauch to
celebrate survival, which in Grinnell
takes the form of professors grading
round-the-clock in their frantic rush to
go away, therexhaustedrcampﬁlapses

ferreting out her motivations, not
one oi them stopped to consider
cultural conditioning or ethnic identi-
ty. Rather the entire class lett un-
challenged the professor's hypothesis
that she had been taught that the
candles would “ward off evil spirits."
It would not in any event have avail-
ed to point out that Judaism en-
courages no belief in evil spirits,
demons, heaven, or hell, Evil spirits
are the close allies of Cartsian
Dualists; with spirits, good and evil,
one can account for all things without
any confusing spectra of alternatives.

American analysm naturally view the
woman in question simply: her good
side rationally rejects religion as
superstition, while her had side clings
to it for the same reason. After cenr
turies of emotional posturing, humanir
ty has finally come to accept what lt
perceives to be the Mathematical View
of the univers : things are either
black or white. Unfortunately, it has
done so in the century in which
Mathematicians discovered multir
valued logic, which permits any
number of states of relative truth and
falsity. (Multiplicity is not, of course.
anything like nonrduality, However.
the hyphenalion itself suggests the
dualism to which the very term
'non-duality’ is usually subjected, even
in the most serious of discussions.)

My dualistic preoccupation involves
a more personal factor as well. For
five weeks I waited impatiently for a
back—ordered contact lens to give me ,
relatively complete color vision for the
first time in my life. Pondering the
familiar differences between blue and
yellow, speculating in ignorant
fascination about the unknown nature
of red, 1 was struck by the number of
people whose mental world is entirely
black and white. Vietnam was first
perceived to be a mistake by informed
intellectuals who knew that the situa-
tion was complex and muddled. We
pulled out, however, not because the
public saw this truth but because a
majority reversed polarities of ‘good
guys‘ and ‘bad guys' and declared
America dead wrong. Such a reversal
threshold seems to have been reached
in America with the current Iranian
Afghan crises, But this time we are
the good guys, the lslamic militants
are the bad guys. the Russians are
more bad guys, and the Islamic
militants are more good guys. Grow~
ing American frustrations tempt us to
see all as black and white, but to this
observer (to whom. until recently, a
ﬂashing red light was invisible on a
sunny day), the allegedly red cloud
over the Persian Gulf seems a dark
and dirty gray.
