cooking equipment, and bike repair

, equipment. with all oi this equipment

' at the disposal of Grlnriell students, all
one needs in order to participate is lots
of interest and enthusiasm, Thus GORP
is a selisuiiicient program that needs
only student support and interest to
function.

The purpose or GORP is twoinld:
First of all. it is a fun escape from the
“scholastic syndrome“ of being buried
in your books. Activities that do not re
quire any speciiic skill include short
hiking trips, horseback riding, and
short bike rides. Anyone can par-
ticipate in these trips tor enjoyment or
an afternoon study break, Leading
these trips is primarly a matter oi Cour»
dinating dates and times.

 

Secondly. GORP otters an outdoor
learning experience ioi- people at all in
terests and all levels of ability Having
capable student teacherrleaders is imr
portant to help beginners in activities
that. take a degree (It skill. such as cave
ing and climbing, one oi the important
aspects oi GORP is that students teach
other students and thereby sustain a
core at leaders. For the more dillicult
activities the leader must be able to
leach skills and provide for the safety of
the group,

GORP can be described as a service
organization {or several reasons
GORP provides the opportunity tor a
"learning by doing" experience
Students tand iaculti i can learn how to
sail, ski, ﬁx a bike. or spclunk by going
on a GORP trip or attending a
workshop. All skills necessary [or any
GORP trip can be learned through
workshops. experience or earlier trips.
or simply on the spot while on a trip

Secondly. people call borruvi equip
ment irom GORP on an indi\ idual basis
or as a dorm group. A third reason iiliy
GORP is a service organization is that
it responds directly to student needs,
ror example. ii someone is interested
in going horseback riding, he or she
should go to the Sunday night GORP
meeting At the meeting someone only

needs io suggest the day aiirl time h
