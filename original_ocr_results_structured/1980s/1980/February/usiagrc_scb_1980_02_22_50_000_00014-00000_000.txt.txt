Considering our place in history

.To the Editor: At some point in the
next century our generation will
come under the analytic scalpel of

: historians, and the prospect oi what
. ey might [ind is scary. if we con-

nue in the direction that I believe we
are heading. the iuture is not promis-
lng..

- our generation, and, it appears,
Americans as a whole, seems
misdirected as to the purpose of the
nation. Much has been written about
the “Me Attitude" of the 19703, and
iithile the merits of that assessment
can be debated at length, I believe
that this notion is only a stepping
stone to a more definitive conclusion. I
think that as a nation we have lost our
sense of direction. We no longer unite
in a common struggle for an end.
Rather, we unite in a common strug»
gle against any means necessary to
achieve an end.

We are no longer united in securing
ireedom ior the peoples of the world,
we are united against the Com
munists. The nation is not united in
making itself energy independent,
rather the nation witnesses Squabbles
among the anti-nuclear forces, the
antlrcoal forces, the antirsolar forces,
and all of the other antirfactions in the

. country. In our elections, voter choice
is a matter of choosing the lesser of
two evils. Not all opposition is
repulsive. The issues and concerns of
our time are exposed and the people
are informed when two opposing par
ties debate. I believe that the nation
would best be served with constructive
criticism, rather than the barrage oi
destructive criticism that accomr
panies any new thought or innovation
This is the only way that America, or
any other society for that matter, can
move forward.

What is irightening to me is the
complacency oi most Americans, who

are unwilling to oppose, unless their
creature comforts are threatened, I
suppose that is not out oi the ordinary,
the great social scientific thinkers
have been telling us forages that man
is only galvanized into action oi any
sort, when he, or something dear to
him, is threatened. Even that is
changing. Oil. a commodity as dear
and precious to Americans as
anything can be, has been threatened
for the past seven years, and we still
have not responded to the cry for an
energy self-sulficient nation.

Until recently, Americans have
responded to whatever call was
issued. United we forged a nation out
of the wilderness, built the strongest

Since the end of the Second World

Rebuts Borenstein’s attack on radicalism

To the Editor: In his article “Activism
of the “me generation? Nathaniel
Borenstein rightly attacks the igr
norance of many modern activtsts. He
recognizes the harm that results from
“knee-jerk radicals" who jump on a
bandwagon cause without suiiicient
knowledge to support or defend their
position, He Cites the antlrnuke and
anti-registration movements as ex
amples. I wish that Mr. Borenstein
would not stop here, though. Does he
really believe that the superficial
knowledge most 60': students had of
Vietnam constituted a well-informed
activist force” Just as in other
political movements, the 60's protests
were led by small groups or dedicated,
knowledgeable people.

Many oi those involved in the recent
protests against draft registration are
uninformed, but to dismiss the entire
movement as an unthinking 60's
revival is asinine. Why are Vietnlilm

and Afghanistan so “radically dif~
ferent,” making the emerging anti»
draft posture a mere “imitation of the
idols (including Mr Borenstein'i) of
our youth," rather than a sincere
abhorrcnce oi unwarranted military
“solutions?" Armed intervention is
not only a foolish, war mongering
move at this point, but it also
mlsinterprets Soviet motives.

In writing of the Persian Gulf which

assumes that the Russians have or
pansionistic intentions, which an ob
jective examination fails to support
He suffers from the very malady he
attacks. namely ignorance. In taking

Lying dormant in the will oi this na-

everywhere. Destructive criticism of
ideas and plans toward that end serve
only to stagnate the nation. Construcr
tlve criticism that reflects the goal in
mind is the only way to achieve pro-
gress.

The trumpet summons us again. Not
to arms, but to a test, the supreme
test of freedom: its use. We are not
being asked to delend freedom. we
have a more arduous task: to marshal
the national resolve, to unite the na-
tion in using what freedoms we enjoy

Mr, Boi-cnstein suggests no spct‘ ic
response, but ironically implies that
the US. must intervene with military
iorce, risking the chance oi nuclear
war, in order to “protect” the
Alghams. Besides ignoring the
possibility of a diplomatic solution in

Borensteill forgets President Carter's
