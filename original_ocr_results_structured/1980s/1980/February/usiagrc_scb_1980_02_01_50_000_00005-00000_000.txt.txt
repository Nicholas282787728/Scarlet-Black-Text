debate out ot the meeting by his calm
taetual attitude and his negative reply
to “when do we get to say ‘Ilcll no we
won't go.” All speakers were received
attentively and usually a reply was
voiced. Those who went to the meeting
seemed to desire facts and the
reassurance that they weren't alone in
their indecision on this subject, The
freedom to speak in this meeting was
well used by everyone and has
stimulated a continuation ot dlSCuS'
stuns throughout campus.

Monday night’s meeting ended with
a statement summarizmg usoc‘s

views on the proposal at registration:
“ The Grinnell Chapter at the
Democratic Socialist Organizing Com~
lnittee opposes any attempt to
reinstate registration tor the drat't as
an unnecessary and unconstitutional
intringement on civil liberties during a
time at peace." The DSOC lollowed
this statement with a request to sign a
petition supporting their statements.
Both proponents and opponents ot
registration reinstatement discussed
their tacts and ideas; luckily, these
"sides" periodically met on the same
grounds. otten. the persons who spoke
against registration talked of their

privacy, consciences, and their
treedom, while those tor registration
spoke of their country. Grey’s views
against registration are based on his
assessment or our country's need and
these assessments are Where the real
controversy should lie. There may
come a point at which our ability to
have privacy, consciences, and
treedom tsuch as Monday’s discus
sion) is threatened and our inability to
defend those rights, which we all 0b-
viously hold dear, will occur. This is
the lundamental issue and the one we
must address in making our decision.

Health center
overnighters

by Bob Kleiiie

On Monday, the Health Center will
begin expanded services to the com-
pus community, including overnight
care [or those cases determined by the
nurses to be “marginal.”

A “marginal case" is an illness
which does not warrant hospitalization
but which quiet bed rest would help,
Health Center Coordinator Irma Hall
stated, “A Student is eligible for this
care in all situations except where the
nurses feel a doctor’s examination or
hospitalization would be more
beneficial.”

Hall also stated that the Students on
duty would not be able to admit
students. Therefore, anyone who is in-
terested in being admitted should go
while a nurse is on duty, which is lrom
3 am. to B p m. on Saturdays

Students will be allowed to Visit the
“patients” whenever the nurses are on
duty,

While the capacity for this new ser-
vice is nine students, Hall stated: “In
the past, when we had nurses on duty
24 hours a day, we averaged about
three students per night.”

Since this is a new service, Hall is
proceeding carefully and hopes that
all goes well; she also would like the
privilege not to be abused. she says
this new service will provide the meme
imum possible benefits for the entire
campus community.

Grey's contention that the American
policy-makers have misunderstood
most of the important events in inter-
national polltics since World War IL
Although conditions were better in the
mid71960’s and in the Ford and early
Carter administrations, the U.S. is in
some ways returning to a cold war
perspective.

Another observation of Grey's is
that we tend to think of Third World
nations merely as an arena tor the

cockfights oi the superpowers. This
part of his talk ties into his longterrn
research ettorts. The Third World‘s
dependency on the major powers,
speciﬁcally in Ethiopia, has been the
subject of a recent paper.

This historical overview oi changing
political perspectives since World War
ll should be good backround material
to better understand America’s cur-
rent conilict and claims in the Middle
East and with the Soviet Union
