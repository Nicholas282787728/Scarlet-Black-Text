SGA approVes budget increases

oy Jody Ho/tman

After much discussion, this
semester’s SGA budget of $51,650.00
was passed at Wednesday night's
meeting, This budget was set up by
the new treasurer, Bob Greenberg,
and the finance committee and con-
tained $1,907.50 more than last
semester’s budget.

The meeting contained an explana-
tion of the increased income and ex
penditures, Greenberg opened the
discussion by stan'ng that he felt it
was “a damned good budget." Chris
Nylander then explained that a ma-
jority of this increase in income came
from an underestimation of first
semester’s GB. 5: R.( general budget
and reserve) which was thus carried
over to second semester.

Dan Flynn next discussed the 5&B's
budget raise of $800. This increase was
attributed to a 10 percent .

underestimation of printing costs for
this year, which was not realiied until
iour weeks after first semester budget
approval. Jeff Cronin (first semester
treasurer) suggested that the 5&3
cover this cost increase in second
semester‘s budget.

The movres program received a 3350
addition to their budgeting. F. Hudson
Miller explained the need for this in
crease by stating that over the past
two years, new films have risen from
about $400 pei‘ film to $750 a film.
Without an increase in budgeting
Miller feels he will be left with ”little
creative room” in film appearance
planning. it was brought out after fur
ther discussion that films scheduled on
campus otten cover ior cancelled cone
certs and thus the film chairpeople
need monetary leeway to schedule for
unexpected cancellations. An example

was the weekend of Feb. 1-3 when a

dance was cancelled and two expeiir
sive movies tllui'old and Mantle and
Catch 22) were scheduled in place oi
the dance.

Following discussion of film
budgeting was major concert
budgeting. Larry Cohen explained this
area as being the most inflationary.
The budget for major concerts was
raised by $905 to help offer more com-
petive prices to groups tiucl costs ac-
counting for some of this need to offer
more money),

objections we made to all three of
these budget increases based on the
idea that uvcrcxpenditui‘es could be
taken out oi general revenues tsubject
to joint board approval) and would
thus curtail wasteiul spending.
However, all amendments to reduce
raised budgets were voted down and
the budget, as proposed. was passed.

Summer internship credit OK’d

by Bob Kleine

The major concern of last Monday’s
faculty meeting was to determine
whether practicum credit should be
given for summer internships.

The proposal was initiated by the
curriculum committee. Professor Bill
McKibben and others immediately
questioned the vague wording concer-
ning the role of faculty advisors. Aiter
some discussion, an amendment was

added which insured that the faculty
advisor would be instrumental in the
decision-making.

Dean,Waldo Walker supported the
proposal by stating, “We must offer
credit for summer internships, since
we may lose prospective students to
our sister ACM colleges because they
offer such opportunities."

Many members vorced a concern
that students could receive wages for

the work done in the internship It was
pointed out that many institutions will
more readily accept an unpaid intern
because work will be done at a
relatively low cost.

After two hours of debate. the
resolution passed by a voice vote to
allow summer internships tor a max
imum oi 12 credits per summer. Also,
students may only participate during
two summers while at Grinnell.
