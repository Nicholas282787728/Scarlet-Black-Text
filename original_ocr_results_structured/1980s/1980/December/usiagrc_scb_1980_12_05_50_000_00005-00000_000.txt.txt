The tie“ plan, which has an
estimated cost ol $2 to $3 million, will
radically alter the present design and
layout ol the library. Although details
oi the design have not yet been linaliz~
ed. the broad features oi the renovas
[ions have been established. The exterr
rial walls at the building will be retain
an, in order to let the basic appearance
ot But-ling remain as it is now.

However. to produce more space tor
books, a twostory penthouse-type
structure will be added to the center
section ol the root. 'ith this addition,
the library will gain 10,000 square last
at ﬂoor space. and the room to ac»
eomodate up to 600,000 volumes.

Numerous other changes will be
made to the existing floors in an etiort
to make the organization design more
ellictent. Cataloguing and ordering Will
both be located In the basement, and
the space presently used ior govern
menl documents will be converted to a
vzlull anti reading room tor special cot
loctions and the archives, The bound
periodical region will become a space
tor nnerutexts and computer terminals,
and the center 01 the basement Will
become a print study room,

According to Christopher McKee,

Pioneer deienders found themselves
trapped in many two-on-one and mree-
onrone situations {or much of the second
half, which helped Mt. Mercy Shoot 66
percent from the field in that hall,

There were bright spots tor Grinnell,
though Staples, a freshman, led the
team in scoring with 24 points. He shot
69 percent (11716) from the floor and 2-2
at the foul line. Pat Walsh contributed
18 points, despite spending much of the
game on the bench with [our fouls.

The Pioneers lost their second game
Tuesday to Simpson at indianoia, 3357.
Walsh led the team with 16 points, and
Brian San-lore added 15.

The Pioneers open Midwest Con-
lerence play tonight at 7:30 against (202
in Darby Gym, The team travels to Mt.
Vernon tomorrow to take on Cornell
