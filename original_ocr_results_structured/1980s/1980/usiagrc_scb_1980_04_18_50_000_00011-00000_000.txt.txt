Taking a careful look at Burling renovations

Due to the almost two-hundred
lhousand dollar grant Grinnell has
received l’rom the National Endowment
for the Humanities, which (irinnell
must match three to one, a renovation
oi lturling Library is being planned ior
the near future. If handled properly,
this renovation could turn a now
(lelicient library into an excellent one.
Since an opportunity [or student input
into the planning has been accorded, it
is important that students begin
thinking about possible improvements
lor the Library in preparation tor the
iorum to be held on the subject on April
23 President Drake, Librarian McKee,
iind |he architect, Ben Weese, will be
present to hear student ideas.

To be successful. the renovation must
do much more than just add shelf
space. for a library is more lhan just a
Sophisticated Warehouse. The plan tor
the progressive Hampshire College
Library suggested that a library should
be “a place to collect. to make
available, rind to exploit ‘dll available
Channels and media of com-
munication." A good library must be a
focal point of campus activities, and
although a distinctive appearance is
important to this, it is the practicality
and function of the library that is the
most important.

it is in this area. practicality, that
hurling primarily tails. The design oi

|he library makes it diiiicult i‘or many
people to study well there. Because
there are no real walls dividing the
building, because there is no carpeting,
rind because most at the surfaces are
hard and tlat sound travels very
quickly and easily, so that a cough in
the main reading room can be heard‘ in
every carrel in the library A primary
goal of any renovation must be to
decrease the noise level, and carpeting
is the first step towards this.

Another important change must
occur in the general conﬁguration oi
the stacks and the Carrels. 0n the
mezzanine the Carrels form a “ring”
around the stacks, and on both ﬂoors
they are situated in rows along major
lanes oi trail'ic. Thus, it is inevitable
that many people must pass by the
carrels when they move about the
library, and this can he wry distracr
ting. A more sensible design would
have the earrels in small groups and
removed from heavy traffic lanes.
Yet, in addition to Carrels, there must
he areas lor group study and extremely
quiet, isolated Study, There exist no
such areas in Burling now except tor
the two conference rooms downstairs,
and even these are hardly usable
because at their sterile, harsh at-
mosphere, ideally, this sort oi room
would duplicate a living room: quiet,
relaxed, isolated. and comfortable

Several of this type oi room must be
included in the renovation, They are
appropriate because at times complete
escape is necessary, and also because.
they cater to the individual instead of to
the masses as carrels do

Just as important as the design at the
library. however, is what that désilln
contains. It is essential to create a
proper environment and mood cons
duelve to studying and learning, and a-
sterile environment begets sterile
minds. A library must be
comlortable and enlivening, yet not so
much so that it distracB studean. Color
and texture are important to this—both
are notably lacking in hurling. A first
step toward good color and texture
would. again. be carpeting.“

The most important campone of the
interior is. of course, furniture, which
also adds to the building's, color and
texture A wide variety oi iurniture'
would allow |or individual tastesand
also decrease the risk of uniformity
throughout the library. Couches should

so students can sit comfortably in the
corners as well as lie down on them.
There should be lounging chairs,
Suitable for relaxing or reading a’
magazine or book and as soft .and‘
Comlortable as possible. These serve an
entirely different purpose than normal
carrel chairs, and their design should
show thisi one can not sink down into a
carrel chair, but one does need to sink
dawn and be comfortable in
something Several diiierent types of
these chairs would be best to provide
lor the most individual choice.

For the same reason, several types at
earreis should also be provided. A.iew
possible kinds are the connected blocks

walls almost entirely enclosing the
