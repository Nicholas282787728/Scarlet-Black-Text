Culinary and cultural diversions

A large section of this week’s S&B is
devoted to the vast spectrum of cultural and
culinary experience which exists outside the
realm of the campus. Some of these places
are familiar to students, others will be quite
unheard of, Our compendium, pulled
together by Eric Rasmussen, our entertain-
ment editor, does not pretend to be all-
inclusive, but it is exhaustive. Here we pre-
sent the homey lunch kitchen, the elegant
dinner club, the exotic spaghetti works, the
ethnic rural bar, and the too-good-to—be-real
steak house.

As a noted connoisseur of Iowa culture
once said, the best places are the ones you

discover yourself. Here we modestly offer a
few suggestions on where to start,

Also this week, take note of Sunday’s
chamber music concert, and a spate of flicks
running the gamut between Bergman and
Brooks.

Inside, you’ll find stories on housing ine-
qualities and what students have tried to do
about them, a preview of next week’s convo
about the decorative arts, and reports on the
CSL furniture policy plus the SGA’s action on
the policy. The SGA presidential run-off and
the vice presidential race are upcoming, so
keep your ID’s ready for all the voting you’ll
have to do.
