The Johns, Tile name may sound odd,
but their music is making a name for
itselt The Johns are the newest on»
campus band and consist oi Charlie
Briggs, guitar and vocals; Greg
Luther, saxophone, Mike Alexander,
drums and vocals. and Mike Heckman,
bass guitar

Though together tor only about two
months, the band has already been in»
volved in some controversy. Many peo-
ple opposed hiring them to play at the
James Gang Bang because they were
an all on-campus group. However. the
organizers lrom James Hall arranged
to hire them anyway

"We listened to demo tapes l'ronl
about 12 or 13 hands We could have
hired," said Jeff Hersh, James Hall
coordinator "They came trom
everywhere lroni between luai»
shalltown and chicago and ranged in
price irom mu to about $2000 dollars,
Some of them were horrendous. To be
honest, The Johns were the best band
we heard and they’re only costing $450.

Band member Briggs described tie
hiring as 'a combination of luck and be-
ing good enough to do well." Alexander
also pointed out that The Johns are
more likely to give a good perlormaiice
than many other bands "To most out
oi-t‘own bands this would Just be
another gig. We've got a little more at
stake in how well we do,“

The group originally came together
in an almost inlshappeii way. Briggs
and Luther had talked bout getting a
band together at one time, Heckman
was also looking tor a band and heard
that Briggs might be interested The
three got together and lound that all
they needed was a drummer, They

from Heckman, and they were all
set. Alexander had his drums sent irom

And where did that name came from?
"Well, actually we started with a list of
about 100 names." Said Luther The
Turkey Gizzards and The Somber Reps
tiles were cited as an indication of what
the list was like. After several votes,
The Johns was selected as the group
name. “It was the only one on the list
we didn‘t all hate," noted Heckman,

All the group members have
previously played with other small
group. Alexander, who started playing
drums when he was eight years old and
played with a few bands in high school.
was perhaps the most surprised to be

back at it. ”I didn't expect this at all
when I came here," he said. “I’m still
not exactly sure what happened]?

Heckman has been playing the violin
for seven years and started playing
bass about four years ago. He played
in hard rock and disco bands in high
school, but says this is his first ex-
perience with playing "this kind or
must.” _

The saxophonist, Luther, also started
out young. He began playing the
clarinet in fourth grade and started the
saxophone in high school. His
background includes a high school
jazz/rock band, the college Jazz Band,
and last year, The Toilet Fish, He plays .
a lot of backup and impronses the solo
spots in the pieces.

Briggs has perhaps the most im»
pressive musical background in the
group. He began playing the violin in
third grade and guitar in tenth grade.
The summer before his freshman year
he went to ltaly to study voice but
decided, ”I didn't have the conviction to
stay with that. I decided that i was hap»
pier just playing my guitar.” Last year
Briggs played with both The Dentists
and The Toilet Fish.

Unlike the groups which have recent-
ly preceded them on campus, The
Johns hope to stay together. They
already have hopes tor a date in a
rock’n’roll club in Washington, D.c.,
over break. Nextsemester. they plan to
put<together some original music and
will be looking for jobs offeampus.
“We don't want to get stale." said
Briggs. "We would all really like to
keep on playing together after the Gang

Bang "
