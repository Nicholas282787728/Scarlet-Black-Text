‘Tlie Maids’: seeking ultimate consecration

. by Eric Rasmussen
Jean Genet’s play The Maids will be
presented this Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday in the Arena Theater. The
play will be performed by both a
female and a male cast: The women

. (Sheri Scott, Priscilla Finch, and

Miriam Mustl will go on at7230. and
the men (Bob Weiss, Kevin Shelby,
and Michael Glasman) will begin at

.9:30 each night,

Director Ellen Mease explains the
reasoning behind the two casts:

‘ “While Genet intended the play to he

performed by young men, the female
roles are so terrific that they nrp usuale
ly done by women In fact, there has

' never been a major protessional pi o-

duction done in drag "
As Sartre notes in Saint Genet: Ac-

: tor and Martyr, the homosexual Genet

attempts in this play to live out the
impossibility or being a woman By
the inclusion of a female cast, the play
shows not only ﬁle irreconcilible 0p-
position between masculine bodies and
temine gestures, but also that of
feminine bodies and masculine willso
Written while Genet was serving a
series of prison terms for theft, The
Maids is based on a real murder case
In 1933, the Papin sisters murdered
their middlerclass mistress (sliced her
to bits) and headed to their garret for
incestuous lesbian lovermaking, Dur-

' ing the ensuring trial, French left-

wing intellectuals, Sartre among

them, attempted to transform the
Papin sisters—one paranoiac, the
other hysteric, and both severely

' retarded~into working class iiiai-tyi-s.
. But neither of the maids achieved her
. execution amt uiiiitheasis.

In they play, Madame is called
away by her husband's untimely
release trom prison and the sisters
have to abort their scheme to poison
her, Claire and Solange realize that
one of them must die in Madame’s
place, As Claire prepares to immalate
herself on the altar of Madame’s bed,
she invests Solange with herself: “It

.will be your task, yours alone, to keep
us both alive."

As Claire becomes Madame in
death. so Soiange becomes both
sisters. Alone on the balcony at the
end of the play, Solarige envisions
herself clad m the red garb of
criminals, ascending the gallows and
being seduced by the hangrnan.

“For Genet,” Mease concludes, “the
ultimate consecration will be copular
tion with death.”

The female version of the play Wlll
be perlormed by only women ace
tresses, But Genet felt that the human
psyche was made up at both male and
female elements

“We are trying to make this
philosophy concrete in the stage
space,” Moase explains, “so, in the
male version, while we have men. who
are clearly men playing the roles,
they will be shadowed by their female
character-counterparts, These women‘s
shadows will watch the proceedings
with cool objective eyes, but they get
caught up in the play and are drawn
Into the action.

Another aspect oi Genet's
philosophy lies in the mirror image
He gives a neat but devastating twist
to Sartre's iundamontal argument in
Being and Nothingness, and Contrives
