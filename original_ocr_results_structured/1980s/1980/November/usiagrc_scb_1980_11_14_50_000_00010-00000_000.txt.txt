To most people in die college com-
munity the Preschool is just that small
brown building across from ARE, but
tor many parents in Grinnell and sur-

rounding towns it is an important first »

step in their child’s education.

The first thing you notice when you
walk into the Preschool is the size oi the
furniture. The chairs are about a foot
ol{ the floor and the tables are just a
few inches higher, but this is to be ex-
pected when you realize that the kids at
the Preschool are between the ages of
three and live. There are also lots of
toys and books and, of course, animals,
To be specific, the Preschool has two
guinea pigs, a rabbit, and a
salamander,

The Grinnell College Preschool is
owned and operated by the college and
is licensed by the state of Iowa. It is
technically a lab of the phychology
department and is used mostly by
students in developmental psychology
classes. But, as Carol Nielsen, director
of the Preschool, explained, “Some
other profs use the kids ior research.
We've also been involved with the
education, art, music, and physical
education departments.

The “student body," as Nielsen calls
the 51 kids that are enrolled in this

The Grinnell College Preschool:
a place to get “bigger”

semester’s classes. are not just
children of Grinnell College faculty.
“The Preschool is open to the whole
community,” Nielsen explained.
“Faculty kids make up only to to is per-
cent Of our enrollment.”

The Preschool runs pretty much on
the same calendar as the college, with
14—week semesters. There is a 9-1130
a.m. morning session five days a week
and an additional 11:30 pm. afternoon
session on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The cost of sending a child to the
Preschool is $105 a Semester for the
three-day a week session and $70 a
semester for the twice-a-week class.
Nielsen explained that these figures
translate to a cost at $225 per day. “We
try to keep the costs comparable with
the other preschools in town.H Nielsen
said. Nielsen explained that there are
preschools at the United Church 0i
Christ-Congregational ‘and Unitarian
churches, as well as a day care center
and Head Start program in Grinnell.

“The tuition is used ior teacher's
salaries and consumable supplies
only," Nielsen explained. “The college
subsidizos the cost of the program."
She went on to explain that the college

. covers the cost of the building and its

maintenance, as well as the costs of
major supplies such as tables, chairs,
and playground equipment.

This is Nielsen's ninth year as direc-
tor of the Preschool which was started
about 15 years ago by psychology Pro
[essor Gib Thorton. The School was
housed in Steiner basement beiore the
college purchased the portable
classroom which now sits at the
school’s present location.

Since the Preschool is technically a
lab for the psychology department, the
kids are available to be “guinea pigs"
at any time. Nielsen commented on
parents’ feelings about this aspect oi
the school. “There have never been any
questions by parents as long as I've
been here. They know mat their kids
may be tested and it doesn't seem to
bother them. The only question that
ever comes up is that the parents are
always interested to know the results of
the tests But, of course, they can‘t get
them (the results) because they are

anonymous.” ,

one thing that Nielsen is very proud

of is the student/teacher ratio. There is

an average of 17 kids in each of the
three sessions and she is always there

, along with two paid student assistants.

plus volunteers, “We always have some
males, too.” Nielsen said, “and I feel
we can give the kids a little bit more
than the other schools because of this.”

The curriculum oi the Prachool is
also somewhat different from that oi
other preschools. They spend less time
preparing the kids speciﬁcally to enter
school and more time on general
development. “We stress readiness in
reading, maul, and language on an in-
formal basis,” Nielsen explained. ”We
concentrate on social skills and self ex
pression. We want the kids to develop a
good sell image, to express positive and
negative leelings and independence.”
