Love at first sight “for cast and critic”

by Chrisly Richards

This weekend the campus is privileg-
ed to view a superb periormance oi
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet."

The casting is very good, the ac
tors/actresss work very well together,
and the play seems to {low smoothly.
The set is very simple and entirely oft
white, which sets off the beautiful, rich
colors of the costumes without detracs
ting irom the action. The lighting in-
cludes some speCial efiects which take
the place oi set changes, such as a
stained-glass window siiouette eflect
for the scene at Friar Laurence's.

The 34-person cast plus singers. musi-
cians, and crew are under the direction
oi Sandy Moftettl Set designer. lighting,
and costuming director is Jan
Czechowski; choreography is by Babe
Voertman; instrumental music direc-
tor is Elizabeth Hayes; vocal music
director is Leslie Morgan.

The vocal and instrumental music.
costumes, and dance add to the realism
oi the play and virtually carry one to
the streets of Verona. The actors and
actresses enter and exit not just from
behind the stage, but from the audience
as well.

As in most productions, one person
seems to capture the audience's alfec»
tion. In the [irst act, my favorite was
Mercutio, played by Jay Millen. He
does an excellent job, and puts on a
very enjoyable performance as a
yokester. Juliet, Karin Conrad. acts as
naive, sweet, and innocent as any
l4~year>01d could at that time and Brian

Harcourt does an impressive job as
Romeo, Linda Geeslln is very
believable in her role as'Jullet’s Nurse,
and Barry l-iult seems to be a natural in

his casting as Prince.

In all, the actors and actresses do a
fantastic job of staying true to the next,
it may take a while to get used to the
meter and rhyming of the verse but
once one does, it makes the play mat
much more beautiful.

The play last apprommately two and
one-half hours, with a 15-minutes inter
missmn between the two acts

and Sunday at i p.m. Much effort and
money has gone into this production,
the major one for this year, and this
critic advises that you not miss Romeo
and Juliet. it is well worth your time to
see it,
