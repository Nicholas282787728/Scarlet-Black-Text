Are you glad that the Moral Majority
has twisted your destiny? Soon you will
be 0“ to War, to serve and to die. But
it’s only your life, right? It isn't Worth
the bother to do anything about it real-
ly, is it? So what, sit back and relax. Let
other people make the decisions tor
you, it's all the same in the end anyway

A very perverse trouble has been
plaguing me since election night. 1 keep
hearing Karl Maiden saying “What will
you do? what WILL you do?" over and
over again, without so much as a quiver
in his scrutiy voice.

As for me, i know exactly what I'm
doing. I’m writing a newspaper col-
umn.

What about you? Canada? Sorry,
they aren’t accepting people this time
around. Switzerland? Brazil? It you
want my advice, i suspect that this is
going to be a biggie. Real big.
Something on the order of a 20th cen-
tury crusade. Switzerland will be the
first to go. And Braztl Will be Nazi
Within six weeks. Sorry.

Turning to Karl Maiden won’t help,
eimer The man with the $1000 question
didn't give us the magic solution to that
dilemma in his commercials,

Is the sensible thing to do to wait (or
Walter Cronkite to give us the answer,
like the manna tram heaven? That's
what happened with Vietnam, Walter
was so beautilul when he described the
stench of death. so eloquent, so cool.

the blood . . .

Are you going to wait and see it in ‘liv»
ing' color? There is an alternative. you
know. it is called being “politically ac»
tive.” Yes, embarassing as it might be,
becoming “politically active" is really
the wave of ﬁle future. Activism is not
as hard as it sounds. Busy executives
across the country founded the Moral
Majority over a three martini lunch.

contradiction and racism! How do YOU
cash in on democracy? You exercise
your voice in government, 0h, some
won't feel at ease until they've blown up

“them.” The KKK do it, The Black Pan-
thers do it. But that doesn‘t necessarily
mean that you‘ll get to where you want
to go. It's these people that give “ac-

But if she voted for Ronald Reagan,
well, then she’d be an American.

Are you going to let the Moral Majori-
ty label people as “activist" and
“American," as il they wouldn't
deserve to live in America if they didn’t
vote {or Mr. Reagan? I would prefer the
words Facist and Socialist to American
and activist in this situation.

There are things you can do to keep
these people off your back and out oi
your mind. Just step on them. The next
time someone hands you a little leaflet
that says ”A Vote for ERA' is a vote for
Gay Rights," just ask “And what’s
wrong with Gay Rights?” They won't
know what to do. You aren’t reterring
to vague meanings of technical words
employed in some legislation. You are
asking them to think beyond the
slogans. Their response will be spec»
tacular. it would be a good idea to keep
a tow Gay Rights tliers handy. Sort or
like the icing on the cake.
