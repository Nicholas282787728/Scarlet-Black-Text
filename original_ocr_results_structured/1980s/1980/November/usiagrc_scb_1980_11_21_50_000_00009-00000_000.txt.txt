Agaln. though. one main theme kept
ming up, The GHS students said they
ally have very little contact with col-
ge students, and when they did it
asn't very positive. Yet they all realiz»
. that both groups are judging each
her's relative merlt on the [13515 of
ereotypes. "Both groups don't have a
i. - opinion of each other." Schneider
plalned. “Everyone looks at the bad
.ple that cause trouble in each group
d think that all the rest are just like
at." He didn't think that was fair to
yone.
Hovenden summed up why most GHS
dents didn't really want to have allot
do with college students. "when
iu‘re in junior high you want to be
lur own group and you don't mix with
e high schoolers. Now we're m high
haul and we can wait until we get out
mix with college kids”

There is a small group of people on
thls'c'ampus who are in a unique posi-
tion to comment on the relationship bet~
(ween high school students and college
students. They are GHS graduates who

V now attend Grinnell College.
' The 8&8 decided to talk to these col-
lege students and lind out what some of
, the general notions were about college
’ students back when they were high
school students.
- One of the main points that kept comr
_ ing out in all of our discussions with
these people was that they felt that
‘most of the high school kids really only
know of the stereotype oi the Grinnell
College student and that stereotype
has been heavily inﬂuenced by the ac-
tions oi the college students in the late
' 1960s
‘ "When town kids see ‘an out of the on
nary‘ dressed person l'rorn the college
,yvalking downtown they characterize
everyone here that way." Maudey Van
,‘Auke‘n said. “Lots of people's impr
sions are carried over from the '60s
/ "When I was a little kid. going to
'Cooper School across from Quad?
Kevin Lang said "i remember how
[realty looking the college students
were. sitting on roofs playing loud
stereos." It's true that Grinnell was
‘ somewhat of a radical campus during
the late 60s and early 70s. and it ap-
pears that' impressions of that time still
prevail. "I-,‘reaks weirdos, and drug»
gies' were what all those interviewed
came up with as a general impression
that many high school kids have about
the college students.

Even though most at the teelings that
the oils students appear to have are

.. negative;Curt Pabst did point out that
'one of the characteristics that is always
applied to the college students is that
they are _intelligent. "High school
students have always understood the
level of intelligence of the students at
‘the college. and they have great respect
[or it." Pabst said. "What they really
.ilind hard to understand is the different
way of life that the college students
have.”

Dave Strickler agreed With Pabst‘s
point He explained that when he was ill
high school the general description 01 a
college student that was held by GHS
students was that of a "rich, Jewish.
easterner"; certainly not your typical
Grinllell I‘csirlt'nt

Yet most of are people we-
explained that when they were.
school they didn't have very in
feelings for the college "an
students. The reason why? Well
all explained that they had had
kind oi connection. with the. ~
while in high school. Most were
with kids whose parents 'wero
fessors here, or as in Lang‘s case
had a direct connection'wiﬂ‘r _
lege. Lang look math courses
during his high school yealjtw
described himself as “one of “W,
ty junior high kids who is always
ing around the computer cente

But as we ve heard, the preset:
students say their negative i
towards the college stud ntt
sometimes vented in very .
ways. All of the former GHS_
commented that when they were
school throwing things at c ’
students from passing cars "was;
regular occurrence. But on a
serious level Strickler recalled nix
perience he had in high school. .\
tually knew people who would in
bathrooms (at the college) and ’
college students."

Fortunately, there has not been
at this type or abuse lately; in
still are plenty of incidents f
from passing cars. Lang on
what happened when he on '
this practice last year, “I was'w
through campus one night when
pulled up," he said, "I was pron
that they were goingrto throw‘
me. But when they got close tin so
that it was me they stopped sod iii

' They were kids who had gradual

my class.“

That s something else that is a uhi
experience that only this group 0 .
ple can have. They have to don Wl i
townspeople who were their classm
on a different level, now that‘they
college students. Everyone talkedof
mixed reaction towards their been i.
“college" students when they were. .
high school, and most said thalin - ~
long run their friends and dassma
got used to it.‘

But Sara Mathews encounter
lerent kind of response. Mathe
plained that her sister who is in nln
grade, now counts her as a member
the group labeled "college [reaks.‘ ,
