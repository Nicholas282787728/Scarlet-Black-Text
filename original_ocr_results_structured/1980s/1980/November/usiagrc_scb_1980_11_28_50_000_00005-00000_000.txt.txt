Campus reaction to. whistle system explored

Whistle Poll

Would you support and use such a

“Prevention is better than waiting for
another incident,” explained Ellen
McDonald in relerence to the whistle
poll. Due to some isolated mctdents of
assault, the problem ol’ security has
become an issue on campus. McDonald
said there has been much deliberation
over what to do about this problem. One
suggestion, made at an open meeting
about the problem, was to incorporatea
whistle blowing system similar to that
at Colorado College,

The system works on a simple basis.
it anyone hears a whistle blow, they in-
terpret it as a call [or help and respond
to that call McDonald, who is in charge
oi researching the system, explained
that the program would be voluntary at
Grinnell, No one would have to carry a
whistle it they didn't want to,

Recently, students were asked to ﬁll
out a survey to see whether they were in
iavor oi the system McDonald said
that 36 percent of the student body
responded and the majority were in
favor of it. However, McDonald points
out that she doesn't know how the other
64 percent reels about it, and the system
won't work without the cooperation at
all students.

McDonald was surprised that more
men responded to the survey than
women. She stated that at ﬁrst the idea
was to give the whistles to women only,
but as someone pointed out, that would
be biased. One enthusiastic male, who
responded to the system in the survey,
said. "II we are one campus, then we
are invincible "

McDonald is dubious about the sum
cess or the program. She ielt that "the

‘abuse is going to be incredible." But
she added, "We‘ll have to wait and see
because the students are the only ones
who can make it work "

McDonald feels that something needs
to be done about the security at the col-
lege, but the Whistle system is probably
not the answer. She says this project
will probably help the administration
realize that the students are concerned
about their security.

Julia McCray, who attended summer
school at Colorado, did not think the
system there worked. She explained
that it is a good idea in principle, but not
in practice. because it gives one “a

ialse sense or security." McCray cites
the example of a friend who accidental-
ly blew a whistle insrde a dorm. Neither
students nor the security guard posted
at the dorm responded

McCray stressed that this false sense
oi security is worse than nothing.
Students might [eel aver-confident with
their whistles and become less
cautious. McCray says that the peuple
at Colorado were pretty apathetic about
the system. However. she thinks the
success oi the system would depend
upon how concerned students are at
Grinnell and how seriously they would
take it.
