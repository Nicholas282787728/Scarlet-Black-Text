Death players stalk campus again

by Bob Kleine

in approximately two weeks, several
dozen students will be clutching plastic
knives as they go about their daily ac-
tivities. They will be participants in the
second annual Kiss of Death contest
sponsored by the Fencing Club,

The event was so successful last year
that the club decided to try it again this
year. Last year. after the knives for the
65 players were paid tor, the club made
$30. The money paid fora lecturer and
some iencing equipment.

The Contest lasted all of the second
semester last year. When the last two
players, John Paulos and Rick Aulry,
were unable to “kill” each other, the

game was terminated. Paulos had
more cards than Autry, so he was
declared die winner and won me $25
prize.

When a student enters the contest, he
is given his own card. He is then given
the name ol the player who he is to
“kill.” A “killing" is accomplished
when the murderer stabs his victim,
however, a Victim may not be killed
while holding his knife. Thus, the
players are torced to carry their
knives, even while showering!

Some students have used novel
methods to advance in the game. Fenc-
ing Club Organizer, Chris l-lertel, said,

“Last year, one murderer lay in the
street while feigning a broken leg.
When his victim came to help him. he
stabbed her.” ‘

The drive lor participants ior this
year’s game is presently underway.
The fee of $2.50 includes the plastic
knife. The Kiss of Death Organizer,
Carla Tilghman, commented, “So far
we have about so people signed up. We
hope to get at least so.”

The Kiss ol Death game even made
the national news circuit, when an arti-
cle by Daniel Nissenbaum appeared in
a college supplement to a recent
Newsweek magazine.

Healthy endowment holds down fees

by Kathy Wil/holie

Coping with accelerating inllation is
a special challenge [or small private
Colleges—a challenge which Grinnell
College can more readily meet than can
many of its sister institutions.

While Grinnell's student tuition and
fees have been rising steadily, “We
have never increased tuition as much
as inflation." said Executive Vice
President Waldo Walker. A few years
ago, tuition accounted lot 70 percent oi
the college's operating revenues; today
tuition pays only 63 to 64 percent of the
annual cost of a Grinnell education,
said Walker.

Grinnell's unusually healthy endow»
merit income has allowed an increase in
the percentage of endowment iunds
employed as operating revenue. it this
percentage were not raised, this year's
tuition fees would be much higher than
$6,399.

Grinnell's endowment ot about 340’

million now provides over $2 million in
annual income, when the recent sale of
the collegeowned television station in
Dayton, Ohio, becomes finalized in the
next few months, Grinnell's endowment
will shoot up to over $70 millioniand
the endowment income will. also in
crease significantly. Then. said
Walker, Grinnell's per student endow-
ment income will be the highest 01 the
ACM colleges, and it will be among
“the top three or four" colleges in the
country,

The growmg cuss of running Grinnell
are reﬂected in this year’s operating
budget: it totals $12,834,332, up irom
less than $10 million during the 1977118
school years. Of this total, the greatest
single cost is faculty and staff salaries,
which comprise 57 percent or expenr
ditures.

Grinnell's faculty salaries, which
rose 12 percent this year, compare
[avorably With other ACM schools, says
Walker. Salaries of tullrtlme instruc-
tors and aSSIstant professors are “at
the top of the ACM,“ says Walker, in-

September 26, 1980

structors’ salaries range from $15,000 to
$18,000; assistant professors’ salaries
range irom $5,409 to $23,500,
Associate professors‘ salaries, which
range from $17,800 to $24,100, and full
professors’ salaries, which range from
$22,700 to 336,700, rank “third or fourth”
in the 13»college ACM, says Walker.
The process of establishing this
year's budget began last October, and
the Board of Trustees then determined
“the bottom line” at their November
meeting. Walker established each
department‘s budget in January.
Walker is responsible [or controlling
the expenditures of each department,

thus insuring adherence to the budget.

Nevertheless, unexpected price in»
creases, such as the sudden rise in
utilities costs in 1977, sometimes cause
expenditures to exceed allotted
revenues. When deciding the budget,
Walker now anticipates a is to 20 per-
cent annual rise in the price of heating
oil. He also counts on a 15 to 20 percent
annual increase in the price ot library

books. , ,
This year, said Walker, air travel and

food costs are two budget items which
are rising much more quickly than was
projected last winter and both will
probably exceed their budgets.
