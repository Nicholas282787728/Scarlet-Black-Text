Drake presents views to college

by Tom lenk

Grinnell College President George

. ‘ Drake opened the 1980-81 Scholar's Con-

vocation Series with the message that

we should all become "evangelists for
liberal education."

Heeding his own words. Drake traced
the history oi the idea oi a college and
the history of Grinnell College in par-
ticular. He especially noted Grinnell's
longstanding commitment to liberal
arts education since its founding in the
mid-18005. The college was started with
ﬁle idea that it should be a residential
community devoted to learning, service
to society, and religious commitment.
While the emphasis on the last area has
changed over the years, Drake em-
phasized that the former two com-
mitments are still strongly held.

Views

Drake then presented his views oi
what Grinnell College could and should
be, opening with the assertion that a
“liberal arts curriculum is absolutely
essential to the well-educated person."
He explained that this type oi education
lays the foundation for a lifetime of
education by stocking the human ims
agination and developing analytical
and communications skills. However,
he also noted that Grinnell and like in-
stitutions are becoming an embattled
minority as a pragmatic society re-
quires them to justify their value.

Drake also hemoaned the shift of
many small colleges from emphasis on
liberal education to more career-
oriented fields such as business ad-
ministration, library science, computer
science, and law enforcement, terming
much of it "vocational training.” He
blamed this shift on the marketplace,
on demand which'he says has forced
less well endowed and well established
schools to recruit students by ollering
vocational majors thatme students
want.

Ideas

Drake then presented his ideas of
what a good small college should be
like. The first factor he mentioned‘is
that the school should be a residential
community,

This community should be national,
multi-national, and multiracial, retlec-
ting the makeup oi our society.
However, it should also be critical of
that society, sharing in both its joys and
problems.

Small classes were stressed to his
teract on a more personal level. Drake
noted that small class size also makes it
easier for the teacher to monitor each
student‘s progress and thus teach more
eriectively

The admissions procedure was men-
tioned by Drake as being another im-
portant part of a college. He feels that
the admissions process should not

simply screen students for their in-
tellectual Caliber, but should measure
them as people, people who could con
tribute to “our idea of a college" and
also get something out of the ex-
perience.

Drake listed flexibility an area that
he feels Grinnell ranks highly in, as a
major feature oi a good college. He was
proud that the experiment or a free
academic environment (the freshman
tutorial is the only required class) ex-
isting in harmony with high academic
standards was working. Although the
system makes advising more impor-
tant and more necessary, he explained
that the small size of the school makes
this easier to do.

Criticisms

Drake had three major criticism of
Grinnell, the first concerning the
grading system. He ieels that it is too
easy ior students to “play games”
under the present ‘erase‘ system, drop-
ping courses in which they are receiv-
ing a B because they want an A on their
transcript. He felt mat the final result
was not an honest reﬂection of student
performance in the academic field.

Another thing Drake would like to see
is the oilerlng of more general educa

tion courses. He said that while there
are plenty oi advanced courses on cam»
pus, introductory level general courses
in many departments are either
unavailable or too limited for many stu-
dent's needs.

The last or cism involved the lack 01
emphasis on speaking at Grinnell.
There are very iew courses in which
development oi student speaking
abilities is pracitced and Drake would
like to see this changed in some way.

Closing

In closing, Drake challenged his au-
dience with the question, “How can
Grinnell College improve? How can
Grinnell College move from being one
oi the best colleges oi its type to one
that might be commonly recognized as
the best undergraduate liberal arts in-
stitution in this country?m

Drake acknowledged that he was
opening the door for ideas and for
discontent if those ideas weren't acted
upon. He then summed up his idea of a
college in the closing phrase, “A place
where we have an essential agreement
about our goals, but where we constant»
ly question, and constantly work. and
where we are constantly in ierment to
reach those goals.”
