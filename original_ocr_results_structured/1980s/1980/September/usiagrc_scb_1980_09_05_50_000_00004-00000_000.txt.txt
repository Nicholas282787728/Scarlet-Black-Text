year in which KDIC has some maior
problems with security. A $250 cassette
deck was stolen last year. Buck said
that since he has been at Grinnell, two
cassette decks, two microphones, and
records have been stolen.

"it used to be, 'ask lor it, you can
have it.' " Buck said. "You had a Pub
gig. call KDIC," Getting equipment
lrom KDIC will not be as easy this year
One move Buck plans is to look all
equipment onto the studio table

In the past. some amount of partying
has occurred among DJ's and their
lriends \vhile in the studio Hoping to
alleviate this problem, Chasins gave
each DJ a letter with the semester's
program schedule which contained a
statement emphasrzing the prohibition

broadcasting is against rcc regular
tions ”Resins trom pot mess up elec
tronic equipment considerably." Buck
added

Chasins said that a KDIC Stall
member would check the studio
periodically and. it violations are
lound, the DJ would be docked a shill
for a week or even the entire semester.
Speaking at the past thelts and party»
mg, Chasms said, "There are problems
to be dealtwlthbut weare not duelllng
on them, We are not tinged with
gloom,"

Other innovations this year include
equipment improvement in the studio
being done by Station Engineer Bob
Klein. changes in the concert archives
which \Hll make them available lor
more air-time, and the production at
local Public Service Announcements
being led by Production Manager Chris
Hertel.
