Propaganda: Television Movies

Television movies are essential to my
summer survival. What better way to
return to sleep atter a hard day lolling
at the beach than through the
reassurance oi a happy ending and mild
sex. Now, i did say moVies. I must adr
mit, I have never made a serious at-
tempt to crack the prime time
showsibut I blame this more on my in-
fatuation with eating than on any
specific oflenng, After the spiritual
decadence of 3 Jimmy Stewart film, a
trip to the kitchen brings me down to
the ‘real’ world (at least one of them).
Food constitutes an end-all and berall in
the sometimes hard to believe life of a
college student reunited with his or her
family. My mother seems to have
strange visions of a reincarnated high
school student willing to perlorm
manual labor whenever I return from
the netherlands of Iowa. Movies and
food provide vital lines of defense in my
battles with her expectations.

“Jeff, could you reassemble the dog
tonight? The Andersons are coming

overt"

“Well, see, there‘s this fantastic
movie on at G, and another at 9.”

“But it's only 4."

“Oh, yeah, time [or tea break,"

And so on.

Of course, I can hear some foolish
reader complaining oi “sloth, moral

depravity, and antirinlellectualism.“
The movies solve this small irritation or
the conscience by prowding me with in-
spiration for term papers and
fellowship applications. Digestion
makes what I write more cohesive, tor
the rhythmic ourps steady my typing

Summer is not the time to ask mean-
ingful questions about your ex
lstenceisummer is a time to merely
exist. Most oi our experiences at school
aren‘t worth philosophizing about. The
heat and humidity or summertime pro
vide us with sensual overload and men-

tal vacuum. This is as it should be, for,
as a year at Grinnell proves, we rarely
accomplish anything concrete as young
intellectuals. Only when we admit our
origins, hidden deep in New Math, do
we act with assurance. Relationships
here often take an unreal quality and
we agonize over the deep meaning in a
casual conversation. In movies, in the
summer, out of school, we have a
chance to fantasize, to break out of our
ordained roles as ‘the hope of the
future.'

And now, here we are again, in the
heart of Iowa, creating marketable
lifestyles for ourselves, Our food jeers
at us as the Memo takes on yet another
color—but I hear that “Manhattan” is ’
on the horizon, '
