[Students take issue over sports

To the Editor: I wrote because I
wanted to comment on some oi the im»
~plicit assumptions Dean Walker made
in his recent letter to the college come
munity. He states the college “should
aspire to iield teams that are represen-
tative oi the general quality oi the col-
lege." The assumption, obviously, is
that something as been wrong with the
college's programs. We have well rund-
'ed_programs in a large number or

What about
.the others?

. To the Editor: I find it distressmg
Ihat the college administration [eels the
duality ot our athletic program is deter
Amined by the winrloss records oi" the dilr
Terent teams. Waldo Walker has Wl‘llr
1en that the college “should aspire to
field teams that are representative at
the general quality at the college.” it
appears to me that a strong athletic
program is rather one where Grinnell's
diverse student body has a variety oi
‘sports to choose irom. However, our ad-
)ninistration has refused to provide fun-
ding {or many of the athletic clubs, in-
eluding the volleyball. hockey.
'Iwomen‘s soccer and rugby clubs In
stead, the administration wastes
resources to recruit stronger teams ior
Ithe so»called major sports. Isn't it

students the opportunity to participate
in the sport they wish rather than to

participation. What is lacking? Thc rcst
oi Walker's letter reveals his opinion.
“Grinnell and its students only can lose
by a public demonstration oi poor quali-
ty in any ot its programs." What is a
public demonstration of poor quality”
To my mind this can only be a
euphemism [or winning. Some of Grin-
nell's teams have not had impressive

Dear Physical Plant: On Sept 3, at
approximately 9:45 in the morning, one
of the maids came down to Read Bases
.ment and began unlocking and entering
students' rooms, At least five I‘DOmS
were opened by this person, rooms 515
through 511. In 515 the resident was Still
asleep, in 514 the student wasiust about
.10 leave for a class, and those in the
:other three rooms were already in
classes 1 am one oi the students who
was in Class when the maid came
"around. When i returned to my room,
513, around 12:00, I found the WindDW
that I had left locked was open, my
radio had been moved and unplugged,
and that an orange electrical cord had
been put into one at my outlets and run
out of the window,

Opposes
change

To the Editor' This year the ad-
ministration has changed the policy of
Grinnell College to start recruiting and
other measures to insure winning
athletic teams, in my opinion this will
hurt the college tor the ioliowing
reasons.

1 All resources dedicated to athletic
programs cannot be used ior academic
programs.

2. The major sports will no longer be ac-
cessible to those members at the stu-
dent body whose talents are less than
outstanding.

a. it will change the composition oi the
student body. Note that 10 percent at
the freshman class are on the football
team while only 2 percent oi the ups
perclassmeyi are on the team.

4 We will lose those students that come
to Grinnell because this school
(was‘Yl inclined toward academics
rather than athletics.

It the policy towards athletics con~
tinues, 1930 may be known as the year
the Grinnell, vie (and grad schoolsl
