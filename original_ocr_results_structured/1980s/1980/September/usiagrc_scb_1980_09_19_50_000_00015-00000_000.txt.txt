Many of you have read the memo by
Dean Walker concerning the granting
of athletic scholarships at the college.
What is important [about the memo] is
not the truth or lalsity of rumors about
athletic scholarships, but that, within
the current atmosphere or Grinnell
athletics ispceially, the tootball pron
graml. such rumors have become
plausible, and it has become necessary
tor the administration to publicly deny
them.

The rumors have become plausible
because there has been a radical
change in the philosophy ot Gi-iiinell's
athletic program The athletic
philosophy which prevailed when I
entered Grinnell three years ago (and
which still prevails in most sportsl savi
intercollegiate athletics as a compo-
nent ol liberal arts education: the
average student could feel comfortable
participating, even if he lacked
‘nutstanding' ahilitv In high (chool. I
watched as my older siblingsnllendr

athletic program. I. was proud that
Grinnell cared more [or the persons
participating in athletics then it did lor
the success and prestige that athletics
brought to the college.

in the past few years, however, we
have seen the emergence ol a new
philosophy ot athletics. Athletics are
seen as public relations — athletes are
‘representativcs ol the college', whose
primary lunetion is to bring prestige to
the institution, not to learn or grow. In
this philosophy, the goal is to win: [one
lyl through victory can the college ac
quire the prestige and reputation at a
‘wlnner'. The athlete ceases to be a per-
son to the college and becomes an ob-
Ject to be used for his public relations
value. The value at participation is
pushed to the periphery _ the average
student cannot participate as lully in a
program in which his 'average' talents
are submerged under those ol the more
'outstanding' athletes recruited by the
t-nllcge

changes in the psyche ol our communir
ty and that these changes raise critical
questions oi our goals and priorities as
an institution.

I have had siblings here at Grinnell
since 1972, so my memory goes back
Iarther than the average Grinnellian's.
Perhaps I have an idyllic View at the
"Old Grinnell', but |t seems to me that
it was a community which cared for
persons much more than one in which
we live today. The goal of the communi-
ty was for the individual to grow into a
whole person The whole person is
secure in himself, He has a sense DI
Identity within himself which is not

dependent on external factors such as
grades, success. or prestige. The whole
person 'knows who he is'. and does not
have to use things and persons in the en,
vironment to create an identity. Growth
into wholeness was lacilitatcd by the
entire learning process ot Grinnell -
through classes and through social in-
teraction with other people. The old
Grinnell was something to be ex-
perienced, not used.

It is easy to see how the old approach
to athletics lit in to this general
philosophy Athletics was something to
participate in, to experience, as part or

' groiith nsn pcrknn :\5 external success

becomes less important to a sense ol
idciiiiiy. iictoi-y becomes a less in
portani consideration.

This concern with the whole person
made Grinnell a community ol persons
who genuinely cared for one another
and for the world around them. As the
individual becomes more whole, and as
it becomes unnecessary to use other
human beings to prop up identity, it
becomes possible to address others as
truly human' beings, not just as ob-
jects, We can truly care for others as
whole persons only it we care about
ourselves as whole persons

In the time I have been at Grinnell,
this concern [or the whole person has
been steadily decaying In its place has
developed a ‘new Grinnell', In which the
individual is alienated from his sense of
identity, and does not care about
himself as a whole person. This “new
Grinneilian‘ is insecure , his identity
must be propped up externally, by us.
ing Grinnell, the community. and other
persons.

The new Grinnelllan is dependent {or
identity on external success and
prestige 7 alienated ri-om his per-
sonhood, The New Grinnell Is
something to be used, not experienced.

Again, it is easy to see how the new
philosophy oi athletics tits into this new
Grinnell Allenated from ourselves as
whole persons, we prop up our iden-
tities, through 'victory’ on the athletic
field.

This declining concern [or the whole

person has manifested itself asja'

decllnc in our concern For other“

human beings. The new Grinnelllan
cares less for other human beings as a
whole person,

Twocritlcisms could beleveled as the .
argument l have yust advanced. First,
it could be argued that the old Grinnell-
was not the paradise I have described,.
and the new Grinnell is in tact not new ,
at all To some degree, lam sure this is
true » I do not mean to imply that there .
were no “new Grinnelllans' in the old
Grinnell or this can be seen in the_
decline in the sense at Community here.-
on campus, and the declining level or.
cniicern with the world around us, or
vice versa, What I have tried to do is to ,
identify major trends in our communal ,
psyche and to assess their conse;
quences, That the trends do exist has,
been contirmed to me by my siblings
who went here belore me, by alumni.
who graduated in my time here, and by
many whu still remain here. Even ilgl ,
have missed the reality of the old Gri
nell, myargument still stands: my pur- .
pose is-less to describe what we were;
than to identity wiiat we should strive tn
become,

Second, one could argue that the real ..
world is merely coming to Grinnel .
that the world is alienated and we ca
not remain forever in our ivury towe
There is much to be said for th .
criticism. My response is it the'world is
alienated, the world needs havens like
Grinnell In an alienated world, there is
a great need [or places where the in-
diVldual is free to experience rather
than to use, where the individual may
grow toward wholeness and personhood
within a community dedicated to‘;
wholeness and personhood, -

In conclusion, a news bulletin:
-=This past Saturday, Grinnell College
won its ﬁrst football game or the
season, 21713 over the University of'
Chicago The students or Grinnell were -
elated."

It‘s a great day for Grinnell. Our
honor, prestige, manhood, and identity '
have been preserved. ' ‘ .
