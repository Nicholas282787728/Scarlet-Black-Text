Opinion

Break off the attack

President Ronald Reagan, during an address to the nation Monday
evening, announced new limitations on cultural, diplomatic, and
scientific exchanges with the Russians. He also suspended negotia-
tions directed at opening consulates in Kiev and New York. Further
restrictions on the Soviet airline Aeroflot are expected as well.

These reactions constitute what the President calls “a proper
answer” to the Soviet attack against a South Korean airliner. They
aim to bring “justice and action to see that [such an attack] never
happens again.” Few people could disagree with what the President
has set for his goal. Yet the success of even ﬂie noblest goal cannot
be reached if the means are faulty. An effectual answer, rather than
a proper one, must be formulated if similar tragedies are to be
prevented.

Reagan rejected one such option by cancelling our bilateral agree-
ment with the Soviets for cooperation in the field of transporation. It
is his belief that economic sanctions will force the Soviet govern»
ment to abandon what it calls “its duty in defending the security of
[the] motherland," U.S. diplomats have urged Europeans to accept
the President’s outlook and halt Aeroflot service to their countries.
The Europeans, however, are quick to remember the futility and lost
revenues that resulted from sanctions imposed at the time of Poland
and Afganistan. Additional European concessions are unlikely,
especially when such retaliation may invite the Soviets to return in
kind.

Reagan is a man driven by the vision that right makes might, and
perpetual might eventually makes everything right. Retaliation in
the form of economic sanctions is not an effectual answer. Our
government must break off this means of attack to avoid further
catastrophe, Instead, direction should be given towards a policy that
would ease US-Soviet tensions by promoting the historical and
cultural concerns of each country. Misunderstanding of such con
cerns was partly responsible for last week’s needless calamity.

Commentary

Something strange happened last night.
i dropped my tube of Crest toothpaste. Ap-
parently, it hit the lloor cap»tlrst. The sides
were wrinkled up, just the way a car
wrinkles up in a head-on collision. I got a
real big kick out or that. l had never seen
anything like it before. 1 actually laughed
out loud. l laughed:

1. because it was unexpected

2. because I was able to deduce the cause
of this strange phenomenon

3, because 1 started thinking or my
physics class last year. . . etc. etc, etc.
The reasons i laughed were myriad — the
set of unique circumstances that have
shaped me throughout his all culminating
in my pleasurable, almost orgasmic, reac-
tion to this one little incident.

It got me to realizing that a lot of people
wouldn't have shared my happiness in the
same situation, [realized that most people
wouldn't appreciate most of the things 1
find so pleasurable in life 7 and that made
me sad. Wouldn’t it be wonderful it
everybody could share in the same oppor-
tunities and experiences I've had and
thereby be able to laugh, cry, and gawk at
the same things I tlnd so wondrous in this
world? It‘s a shame to think of the many
people who, either out of necessity or cons
ditioning, have never been able to do what
I have done. ‘

Letters

To the Editor:

Now that we all have seen A Clockwork
Orange, how many of us laughed? Prior to
the showing of the film, the campus com~
munity was warned in the form at a letter
about the evils of ‘Orange'. We were told
by an anonymous wellrmeaner that the
coupling of violence and humor leads au-
diences into believing that violence is fun
ny, This association is one form oi
psychological conditioning and that the
acts of violence in this movre should be
condemned. To give ‘Orange’ an x-rating
was not enough {or this zealot. Only one
power was adequate to constrain
him/she/it from a call to censorship and
surely that power was die strong and com-
pelling force of Justice.

I had to wonder why this letter had not
appeared last year during the “Three
Stooges” festival. You remember: Moe
hits Curlie in the face with a hammer,
birds tweet and we all laugh? Maybe it
should appear before the opening credits
of ‘Woody Woodpecker’. Soldiers should
receive it in a little oration can before
they kill ior Ronnie. Put it on ‘Space In
vaders'. I think we are all in pretty good
condition. The repulsiveness ol the

— Go Go Godzilla! But, surel no man ver—
sus man, dial standard literayry technique
violence posed a problem for Anonymous,
The solution is too simple to be missed.
Replace the repulsive violence with prime
time violence, we are used to that. An even
more viable solution is to limit the violent
acts to those scum who deserve it. The
vamp deserves to be raped, she wants it
anyway. It’s fine if the young punk gets
knifed, mat is his destiny right? Or, maybe
we should have monsters do our dirty work
passed down from the classics is too near
reality. Let’s just censor reality so that it
will agree more with the movies that are
safe. Let’s try Disney. Oh, but then we
would all be compelled by social duty and
justice to live our lives in tuxedo jackets,

Absolutely everyone, I thought, should
be allowed to attend a liberal arts college,
an experience which has already broadenr
ed my mind. It I could, I would give
everyone the opportunity to learn the
things I have learned. Science majors
would be taught that college is so much
more than a vehicle to propel them into a
world of stainless steel buildings, and air-
conditioned, monochromatic offices. If

they weren’t inclined to it in the first place,
cultureless bums would be forced to ap-
preciate the works of Michelangelo and the
inspiration behind them. Soon even the
most intransigent chemistry major would
have no other goal in his but to travel
across Europe this summer and admire
the legacy of a great age past

But would this be enough? in order for
everyone to share the same perceptions as
l 7 ior everyone to share the same exact
Joie de vivrc — would requirea lifetime of
conditioning. Could our educational
system be changed to this end? Perhaps
all society could be redirected so that
every child would be raised under the
same circumstances as l.

l rinsed out my mouth and stepped out-
side the bathroom, The dorm was ex
ceedingly quiet and I wondered where
everyone had gone. Glancing out the wine

white gloves and no pants. Thank God that
our money does not read, “In Disney We
Trust'.

On the other hand we must make
another form of prolessron, We must admit
that we are all brothers in sin. We are all
prone to violence. We are all capable of
maiming, killing or raping. We are all
human animals and take part in violence
for the same reason our brother in A
Clockwork Orange watched the ‘viddy‘.
Our straltjacket though, is this corporal
one. All men and women share similar
reactions to violence. We are bum excited
and repulsed by it. If our violent nature is
to be properly controlled neither reaction
should overcome or envelope us. A man
must retain choice. Though we are thrown
the old society manipulator curveball at
the end of ‘Orange', the point is not lost.
Anonymous would not have this movie
shown to ruifians such as Grinnell students
in fear that it may incite a reign of terror
in the cornfields but if the film is to be
shown anywhere, where better than a col-
lege such as Grinnell? ‘Orange’ is intended
for a semi—critical audience. We are liberal

arts students are we not? Would any man
or woman who has ever walked down a ci-
ty street be shocked by the violence in.this
movie in the first place? — Robert Quashie
