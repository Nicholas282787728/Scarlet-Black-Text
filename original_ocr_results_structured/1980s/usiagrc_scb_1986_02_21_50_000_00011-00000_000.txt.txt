The wi q wor o
spec1al mterest

by Mike Bialichi, I.M. Czar

The Special Interest Basketball season
is in full swing as fifteen teams brawl it out
on the long road to Darby. The Special In-
terest League has more teams this year
than any other year this l.M. Czar can
remember. At present, no team seems
nearly as dominant as the LSD team of last
year. without iurther digression. this
writer presents his mid-season rankings
and capsules of each team.

1. PMS (5-0) 7 Composed of speed and
muscle, these blood-thi sty Shooters are
the only undeieated team, Delense, nor-
mally a syndrome ior SI teams, is the lorte
of this team. However. a close call against
The Hammer oi Thor (they won by three in
OT) forces this writer to make PMS a
shakey l,

2. LSD III (4-17 7 After its graduation
losses, many felt that the Snake would not
be dancing at the end of this SI season,
However, such has not been the case.
Aside from an upset at the wings of the
Pink Flamingos, this team is flying high.

3. Oil (H) — Thought to be only an
average team in the pre-season, oil has
been on, Last week, Off pulled a major
upset. beating Foreplay (if you think it
sounds bad, you should have seen it! I. Led
by the all too vocal Walt Maley, Off often
lives off its name. People never feel come
fortable after beating Off,

4. The Blisters (3-1) 7 Led by Joe “Hit
the J” Perry and Henry “The lane's too
small” Vogelman, the Blisters are a
legitimate choice to win it all. Only LSD III
has popped the Blisters thus far. On Mon-
day, the Blisters put the squeeze on the
Geldings ll. only giving up 9 points the
whole game. Thus. there is little doubt that
the Blisters will infect many more op-
ponents on the long road to Darby.

5. Foreplay (4'1) 7 Led by hot»handed
Herbert Moore. Foreplay has all the key
ingredients to win it all 7 size, speed,
strength. and good shooting. Strangely,
though, Foreplay was so ill-endowed last
week that they could not beat 0ft ln a mild
upset.‘

6. Pink Flamingos (3-1) 7 These buz»
zards are a spiteiul bunch, They put a
giant leather in their bod last week by
defeating Dave Nelson-less LSD III. It is
probably lair to say that the Pink Flam»
ingos are the Dark Horse to Win the Golden
Goose.

7, Men oi Pause (372) — Until Monday
night. these guys (notgals as one might ex
pect) had a strong chance of getting a top
seed in the postseason tournament. Unfore
tunately, it was that time (lithe month for
the Men as they ran into a bad case of
PMS. With two losses on their record,
these guys had better get their act cleaned
up before the tournament,

8. The Wongers From Hell (372) The

. tunately,

Wongers are a competitive team but until
they tell us publicly what a wonger is, I
have no further comment.

9. The Hammer of Thor (2-3) 7 If you
want excitement, sports [ans (as it
Foreplay, PMS, Blisters, and Men ol
Pause aren‘t enough), watch the Hammer
of Thor. Doesn't matter who the Hammer
is playing, you're guaranteed to have pro-
ianity, complaining, fouls, and a close
game. (This writer is holding his breath on
the close game adage, awt this writing,
the Hammer is about to meet the Geldings
II. More on the Geldings in a minute.)

10. Raging Inlellectuals (2~2) — This
writer likes this team for two reasons: 1)
They have a name that wouldn't be cen-
sored by Jerry Falwell and 2) they play as
a team (albeit, not a great one), totally
oblivious to individual performances. Una
fortunately, they will probably be in Burle
ing instead ol Darby come midMarch,

ll. BRI III (14) 7 The third edition of
the Itch looks like all the others 7
disgusting! When the I.M, Czar witnessed
Brian Fitzgerald kick the ball on a fast
break (in the event you are an idiot, this
team ls composed of soccer players), he
wondered about this team. With only one
win to date, this Itch edition currently
resides in 11th place,

12. Larry “Bud" Melman Fan Club '36
(1-4! 7 The club is back this year but with
little improvement it seems that ole
Larry's toast on a stick is more Iikea char-
red bun. No matter, this team lives up to
its name on the court and gets The I.M.
Czar's vote for Comic ol' the Year.

13. Keg Busters (0-5) 7 Their tolerance
level is only about hair a game long, In
every game these boys have been no worse
than five points behind at halftime, Unfore
the Busters are winners, it
seems that only a season ﬁnale against
“Bud" Melman can keep the Busters from
ivinding up a lush in the gutter oi despair,

14 Mad dog 20/200417 Let's be trank:
if the makers of Mad Dog 20/20 knew of
this team’s ineptitude on the, basketball
court. they would change their name. Put
simply. these dogs aren't mad, they're
sad. only one win in five games forces this
writer to rank MD a lowly 14th,

15. The Geldings II (0-4) 7 Realizing
that even bad things come in pairs, the
Geldings are back witll their second edi»
tion. It all goes as planned, the Geldings
will be the only 51 team to not win a game
for two consecutive seasons. Let’s face it,
the Geldings arc at rock bottom and have
nowhere to “look” but up,

And so, these fifteen conglomerations,
varying in talent and skill, continue along
the topsyeturvy road to Darby. who will be
crowned King Airball? At this writing, the
race is too close to call (sorry, Mr. Fox,
about that overused cliche), but it won't be
the Geldings,

Going into today’s meet at UNI,
women's coach Evelyn Freeman is. not
surprisingly, very pleased with the team.
She notes that the group does have a few
.weak spots, stemming largely from the
number of novice athletes, but adds “they
have the dedication and determination
that will help reap success".

The men finished approximately 7th in
