Requesting that the audience not

experiences with racism at Grins
hell at the Speakeasy on November
2. Stating that most iorms oi
racism at Grinnell stem from igr
norance. the panel members
sought to raise awareness oi the
concerns and difficulties at black
students They asked that students
listen and learn instead oi judge;
tor. as many panel members
claimed. only black students can
truly understand the black ex-
perience at Grinnell.

The panel discussion lasted lor
about 90 minutes as each member
talked individually. and there was

a short skit. at the end. Members
talked of the subtle and internaliz-

ed racism they have experienced
personally and or their eiiorts and

hopes to change the situation
Many spoke at the difﬁculties Ul
being a black student in Grinnell’s
I White academic setting, They cited
the lack of black professors both to
educate students on non-white
‘ topics and to serve as role models
[or black students “You owe us
. more than one black proiessor,"
said sophomore Dianna Ward.
“who are we supposed to go to with
our problems?“
"I want a black role model.”
4 said Holland Neal "It's hard to
talk to white people. They can't
. understand my problems "
Others talked of the dual role an
r almost allwhite iaculty iorces
them to play “I am expected to act
‘ white with my white professors,"
. said Samantha Massihgale. “I
must divide myself culturally to
« {eel comfortable,"
Social ignorance was also atlr
‘ dressed as a major obstacle Black

behave like stereotypes of black

"we're not really what they Cone
Sidered 'black' We have an al~i
tected relationship with white pea-l
ple here. There is a constant strugr
gle to iniorm white people that
we're not all the same, that we're
not all what they see on TV."
“Social ignorance thrives at
Grinnell." said Jeff Fields. who
noted that many white students
assume that all blacks are from

"I'm so sick oi being spoken to in

sensitivity and degrading remarks
that stem irom lack oi knowledge
"I am sick oi being called ‘spook'
and ‘Aunt Jemima.“ said Ward
“That's ignorance. Think twice

bciore you call me that."

ignorance also contributes to
lalse assumptions about the
abilities and character oi black
people. said many panel members
“Many people think that Grinnell
gives special privileges to black
students, and that that's why we
get in." said Warcl. - ‘m Just as
smart as anyone else here. and I'm
lust as qualiiied "

“Security guards tollow me
around campus, People in town
iollow me around when I walk in to,
a store,” said Neal “They think
because I'm black. I'm going to
steal something. I have money.
l‘m not going to steal anything "

Another irustration voiced by
the panel was that black students
are expected to educate the white
community "l'm supposed to
educate because I'm a black per-
son," said lliassingale, “People
come up to me and expect me to
answer questions about wellare
just because l‘m black."

ing tor awhile." oliver said.
relating the comment oi
sophomore Diana Ward. quoted in
the Des Moines Register. that the
college had dismissed him.

Oliver cited proiessional reasons
lor his resignation. "My area ot
specialty is primarily in minority
affairs," he said, but his job as
resident advisor oHered him only
limited time ior minority ailairs
work. He has started applying for
positions that will do more to

Interview with
new trustee
Ron Gault

by Dave Jones

Ronald Gault 1'627 is a newly-
elected trustee oi Grinnell College.
Gault, who was elected at the
board of trustee's October meeting
at Oxlord University in England
discussed with the Scarlet and
Black through a phone interview
his iuture as a trustee and, more
extensively his past experiences
and memories of Grinnell.

Scarlet and Block
why do you think you were
elected to the board oi trustees?

Ronald Gault

lcan only assume that the think»
ing is that l represent some value
added presence on the board. No
one has said to me, "Ron Cault,
you will represent A through c
qualities, and thererore we want

you present." 50 t can only assume. . -

that in the minds oi the iolks who
weighed the positions that needed
to be tilled, l represented some
sort oi value added.

Scarlet and Balck
How has Grinnell changed since
you were here as a student?

Ronald Gault

I guess it's really best answered
by the old adage that things
change and yet they remain the
same.’ I've been back to Grinnell
tour or five times and one thing
that is very much the same
because of where it is
geographically is that its a learn-
ing environment People who go
there seem to be very interested in
learning. It's changed in that the
ulallt and facilities of the college
