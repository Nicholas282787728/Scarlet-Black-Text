At a preliminary meeting beiore the
Finance Committee on April 19, represenr
tatives of Haines Hall presented their pro-
posal ior the cost or the party. At the
meeting, the Finance Committee, headed
by John Mol‘fet, asked the representatives
to leave the room while the decision was
made. The deciswn, which usually takes
less than one hour. took a full day in this
case.

This year's “Alice in Wonderland” party
has been scheduled ior May 3 but not
without a bit oi controversy. Last week
l-laines Hail, the sponsor of the event, peti~
tioned the Finance Committee ior iunds
[or the event, Hall members initially re
quested $497 to cover various expenses [or
the party. which range ironi decorations to
security

The Finance Committee notiiied Haines
Hall on Tuesday, April 20, that its request
tor 3497 had been denied and that a revised
budget or 5233 would be submitted beiore
Joint Board ior its approval. Haines Hall
then challenged the 3233 budget and reduc-
ed its initial proposal to $413. This amount,
as with any amount given by SGA, would
have to be approved by Joint Board.

Later, Bill McCullough told Joint Board
that he had been asked outside 9f, Joint
Board meetings to vote down the proposal

‘1

or $413 on grounds that it was more‘ than
enough for the production.

At the Joint Board meeting or April 21,
approximately 25 students irom both
James and Haines Halls appeared to voice
their opinions. When the vote was taken,
SGA finally approved $413 tor the “Alice in
Wonderland" party, With the budget
debates came differences about student
security for the event. The college ad
ministration requires that there be at least
iour students assigned to security [or
events such as these. During past events,
such as relays, those students on security
were paid, The compensation that SGA
suggested [or the “Alice in Wonderland"
party was a T»shirt.

According to Haines Hall president
Peter Hautzinger, the amount allocated
will be enough ior the party, although the
initial request was more desirable,

Mears gets groomed

Painting of the woodwork on the out-
side oi Mears l-lall began Monday in
response to a request made over winter
break by President George Drake. AC-
curding to Dale Hawn, director of the
Physical Plant, the project is an at
tempt "to try to arrest any deteriora
tion irom constant exposure to the
elements."

Dormitory renovations arc the col-
lege's top priority, l-iawn said. Because
stall was available during a lull in the
Loose Hall renovation and the weather
became warmer, work was able to
begin this week. Hawn said “This is no
lull-fledged program" of Mears renovar
tion and emphasized that the action of
the Physical Plant stati is ”entirely
unrelated” to the 5513's lrontrpage artlc
