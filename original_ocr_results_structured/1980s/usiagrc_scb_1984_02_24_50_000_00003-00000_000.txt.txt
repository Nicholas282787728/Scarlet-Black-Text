No bed checks accepted

by Jen Raymond

By the time the “speCial in~
vestigators" made thelr rounds of
the dorms Tuesday night, all of
the students had figured out that
”Jim Tederman's" all-campus
bedcheck letter was a prank. but
that didn’t keep a lew nervous
students from fearing for their
rights.

Tederman himself thought that
the prank letter was "A pretty
good practical joke." He claimed
to have no idea who pulled it off,
and hoped that the 5&3 might
have some insightjnto its origin.
(We were dumbfounded)

Apparently, a few students did
not see the humor of the missive
and ran lrantically into Teder-
man‘s, Student Affairs office
demanding an explanation
Tederman said that he explained
the frivolous nature of the letter
and sent the students away slight-
ly embarrassed but Very relieved.

Just as the novelty had died
down. though. crews of R.A.’s.
faculty and administration ofr
l'icials began roaming the dorms

had followed; Hiey were assaulted
and thrown in jail. Therefore, the
Panthers, in keeping with their
constitutional right to carry an un~
concealed weapon, carried
shotguns while observing the
police. The shotguns “blew a lot of
minds” and generated much tur-
moil among American and inner
national public, he said.

Seale noted that the fact often
overlooked was that for the first
year of observation, no armed
conflicts ensued between the
police and the Panthers. In lact,
he said the first shoot-out occur-
red only after the police tried to
kill Newton. Seale says that the
press for ﬁle most part exag-
gerated the Panthers activity. At
one time, 2000 individual
members of the Party had been
arrested with an average of five
charges each. Seale contends that
such treatment of the Panther
members was harassement, as 95
percent of the charges did not hold
up in a court of law. of the 5 per
cent that went to appeals court,
only 10 percent oi those were
upheld. The injustice served by
the press was reflected in its
diligent coverage of the initial ar-
rests with very little, ii any, repor-
ting of the fact that few of the
charges were ever upheld.

All of this activity served to put
the .1. Edgar Hoover image of a
bunch of “gun-toting guerillas"
into the minds of mainstream
America. ”We were a tough,
revolutionary political organiza-
tion. We weren’t perfect, don’t get
me wrong, but we contributed a
great deal in changing a of
things."

Seale pointed out the idea that
the Panther Party was just a
hunch of guys who wanted to shoot
white people was absurd. The
Panther Party had formed coali»
tions with the White Ap-
palachians, the SDS, and the anti-
draft movement, The majority of
the members at these other
groups were radical young whites
who didn’t quite understand the
stories of police brutality until
they started to clash with police
and get their”skulls cracked” too,
said Scale.

When asked if there is another
country in which he would like to
live, Seale said, “My ancestors
were brought here as slaves. l was
born here and I have a human
right to live here, This is my coun-
try. I don‘tveven think in those
terms (of living elsewhere), and I ,
never have.”

in search of wayward students.
The pack was dressed in over-
coats and dark glasses, and was
led by Professor H. Wayne Mayer
toting his relays whistle and
golden hard hat. The investigators
amused most of the unsuspecting
students and later retired to the
Pub for several pitchers of beer.

When he first saw the letter at
around 3 p.m. Tuesday afternoon,
President George Drake was as
surprised as anyone. After
reading about halfway through
the letter, Drake shook his head
and said, “This has got to be a
joke."

Drake showed a copy or the let-
ter to Executive Vice-President
Waldo Walker, who immediately
burst out laughing when he read
it. Walker pronounced the prank a
success.

While the surprising nature of
the letter caught a few unsuspec-
ting students momentarily off-
guard, most folks on campus
simply decided to take the advice
of the fourth point of the letter:
“enjoy",

rison

At this week's Joint Board
meeting, Ethan Cohen, off-
campus collegeowned housing
president, presented lour resolu-
tions titled “Things the People are
Bummed About." A resolution
questioning the high cost of tex-
tbooks at the College Bookstore
passed. Also, a resolution urging
alumni to contribute specifically
to the Scholarship Fund and the
Student Activities Fund in order
to provide necessary funds for
students unable to afford the tui-
tion passed by a substantial
margin.

The two failing resolutions prl}
posed redirecting the $600 cur-
rently used to fund SGA‘s security
lorce by having the halls provide
their own voluntary security peo-
ple, and “SGA expressing
displeasure at Dave McConnell’s
use of student funds in his pur-
chasing new uniforms for food
service stat ."

In response to the Bookstore
resolution, the Joint Board has
agreed to investigate the pricing
practices for new textbooks and
the used book selling and buying
policies at the College Book Store.
Robbie Sckalor, SGA treasurer,
questioned the appropriateness ol
having a profit organization
within a non-profit college. SGA
will direct the student members of
the Library and Bookstore Come
mittee to look into this matter.

The resolution regarding alum-
ni donations was referred to the
Committee on Student Politics.
which will write letters to class

agents asking them to contribute
specifically to scholarship funds.
Ethan Cohen reminded Joint
Board that Grinnell College
should provide an education for
all students regardless ol finan-
cial smtus, and said that this ac-
tion would help.

The resolution calling for the
dissolution of the SGA security
force was defeated because
representatives pointed out that
the administration has mandated
the presence of an SGA—funded
security force. Vice president
Pete Hautzinger told Joint Board
that “Tederman has the power to
cram it down our Home ."

Doubts about the validity of the
charges made in the resolution
regarding Food Service funds be-
ing used for new uniforms brought
about the resolutions downfall.
Chris Coles, Read Hall president,
stated, “We don't have the facts to
support the resolution." in light of
this, Dave Mathias. Main Hall
president, urged SGA to send so-
meone to talk to Dave McConnel
about his apparent decreased use
of student opinion in making
financial decisions.

In other business, the Joint
Board approved a letter to be sent
to U16 .House of Representatives,
the President, the Supreme Court
and the Administration of Grin-
nell College “deploring the un-
constitutionality of the Solomon
Amendment,"

Before the meeting closed,
Sckalor noted that the Forum will
squire new speakers for use at
dances and that they will be in
next year.

Grinnell caucuses

community members about their
reasons for attending the sweaty,
threevhour first ward caucus and
why they supported a particular
candidate.

John Houser, who came as a
member of the college’s Freeze
and Disarm group, supported
McGovern but indicated mat he
had considered backing Cranston,
who has become known as the
“Peace Candidate.” Houser found
Mondale to be too bland, and felt
that .nobody presently stands a
good chance of defeating Presi-
dent Reagan in November.

In a similar vein, College Presi
dent George Drake, a McGovern
supporter, said that he came to
take part in the democratic pro-
cess and to support his choice for
the presidency. Drake. who was
attending his'first Iowa caucus,
noted that he liked the student
support for the Caucus.

Across town, a small band of
Republicans gathered to officially
start the nomination procedure
for Reagan and to work on a party
plauorm. Except for perennial
candidate Harold Stassen,
Reagan is running unopposed for
a second term. ' ' ‘

in her office. She said that it was
difficult to work with Dentel
because she so seldom sees her.

“When students and staff never
really see a person,” said
Erickson, “it's more difficult to
work with them then if they are on
campus.” However, Erickson
could not find a situation in the
past where there has been a pro-
blem because of Dentel’s office
situation.

Dentel said, “Jenny and I talk
daily about whatever she thinks is
necessary to discuss, but the only
formal business I have with her is
the reservation of Forum
facilities for music and film
events.”

The new job description, accor-
ding to Dentel, no longer specifies
posting office hours for her Forum
office.

Erickson had made comments
about the office hours issue to
Forum desk attendans who asked
her about Dentel's iob descrip
tion. According to desk attendant
Susan Sink, Resident Advisior
Kino Ruth, who works with
Erickson in the Forum, also
discussed the issue with the atten-
dants. Job descriptions are not
Confidential information and can
be obtained by inquiring through
the proper channels.

Erickson’s and Ruth’s com-
ments to the attendants question
Dentel’s job perlorrnance, as did
Tederman’s assertion last
semester that Dentel had failed
to obtain a satisfactory price for
Jazz artist Ronald Shannon
Jackson. These comments com-
bined to raise the question of
whether professional dissatisfac~
tion and not solely economic mat-
ters inﬂuenced the decision to
reduce the contract.

Drake, the only administrator
reached for comment on this ques
tion, declined to comment.

Erickson also said that she had
been contracted to offer profes-
sional advice as to what she felt
should be included in Dentel’s new
job description, but said that she
was not made privy to the
specifics ol the new contract,.

Department

halts search

motive Action Guidelines”, "

In view of the increasing heated
controversy, President Drake
decided on Feb. 18 hours before
Chambers was to give his inter
view lecture to suspend the search
for the tenure-track position of
Professor of Afro-American Liter-
ture, commenting “We do not
believe we can make a fair deci—
sion.”

Finally, a meeting on Feb. 19
(last Sunday) took place at the
Black Cultural Center to discuss
the controversy and the ending of
the search. The two-hour meeting
included Drake, Dobbs. Small and
concerned black students, Drake
explained that the atmosphere at
present was not conducive to the
fair selection of a candidate. It
now appears that Ken Chambers
will most likely be asked to con-
tinue temporarily for next
semester and the search will be
resumed at a later date.

In a statement issued to the 8&8
last Tuesday, Dobbs said that the
decision to suspend the search
was a result of lengthy meetings
between Drake and members of
the English department. She add»
ed, “The motion did not reﬂect
upon the candidacy of the ap»
plicants, it was a situtaion over
which they had no control."

Dobbs also said that a “high
degree of misunderstanding" bet-
ween black students and the
Egnlish department occurred as a
result of this decision, She con-
cluded that the English depart
ment has a “responsibility" to
hire someone for a full tenure-
track position, and that a new
search is expected to resume by
this fall.

Slater remarked on Wednedsay,
“I feel in this particualr case, the
college’s action was warranted,
and if it is dedicated to ,alfiP:
mative action, as it claims t‘o'be, it
should make the effort to fill this
position with a qualilied black,
There is only one black contracted
pr'ufessor on campus at present.”
