The speech is entitled "Food, Politics
and World Hunger" and will focus on
the problem of malnutrition. Moyer
studied the problem last year as a
visiting scholar at the staniord Univers
Slty Food Research Institute. He delinr
ed this condition to be, "When people
receive substantially less than
minimum caloric intake to sustain nor-
mal behavior and normal development
tor children and it is a much more
serious problem than starvation."
Children are mostaﬂected by malnutri-
tion, he continued, because their brains
are still developing, However, it also in
lluences how hard people can work and
hth eliectively they can work.

”We don't know how many people are
suiiering irom malnutrition,“ Moyer
explained "It can be anywhere trom
500 million to one billion and it‘s not
evenly distributed, not by age or
geographically." The areas he points
out as most ailected are lndia,
Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Sahel
Region or Airica.

The problem is also compounded by
the lack of knowledge about the Candis
lion. "There aren't many people who
know about this now," Moyer said.
"The Grinnell campus was moved by
the situations in Cambodia last year
and in Sahel in the mids'io‘s This may
bring the issue back to their attention."

Some attention was given to the Situar
tion at the 1974 World Food Conference
in Rome. vthlch was organized by the
Food and Agriculture Committee of the
United Nations. "The world was Iacmg
masstve starvation after bad food
harvests in 1972 and 1973, The food
reserves were down to nothing and
prices “ere high," reported Moycr. The
purposes oi the meeting were to
rind ways to end the present crisis and
to viard oil iuture problems. Solutions

included increasing rood reserves and
refining the foreign mechanisms to deal
with any recurrence. The most imporr
tant resolution. Moycr said, was the
recognition that “the number one
priority is iood and agriculture. Chang»
ed irom the number one priority or in
dustry or seen as at least equal in im-
portance."

However. the malnutrition problem
did not get main attention and it hasn't
changed,‘ he said. "It's been six years
since that conlerence took place. Where
are we now? What’s happened since
then?" He will detail the answers to
these questions ard also explain why
little has been done, why people in need
have not been getting the necessary
resources and what he sees are solu~
tions to the problem at his convocation
lecture.

"Why we haven‘t been able to deal
with this is mostly political.‘-‘ said
lvloyer. “There are all sorts oi produc-
tion disincentives and a lack in political
power or rural interests tin the Third
World). There are also some very maps
propriate values." He added that
developed countries are also to blame
"We haven't done much because OI our
own political constraints.“

The needy haven't been receiving the
resources because the balance 01’
political power is oil, he said “There is
poor communication between the
bureaucracy and the people and deci-
sions are being made which are very
counter-productive,"

Moyer has many suggestions to battle
this problem or politics and malnutri-
tion. First. he leels that iood production
could be increased by altering aid to the
aliected regions, it this aid is accepted
it can be used to support agriculture
and subsidies, One possible subsidy is
an international iood stamp program,
which Moyer said gives poor people a
chance to buy [00 ' ‘

Education is his next proposal and he
includes instruction in birth control and
nutrition in this category. "They are
very closely related, because as you
educate people generally, they become
more receptive to education about
both '

His last suggestion is to determine
how to dstribute iood internationally.
He stresses the importance oi
distributing proper amounts oi the right
kinds oi iood to the areas uhere it would
be most accessible to those “he need it

He added, "These are things I liopc
the Reagan administration will take
seriously idoii't uant to give a ioreigii
policy talk, because l don't know what
Reagan will do. '
