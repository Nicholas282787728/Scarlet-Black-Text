The presence at National Public
Radio personality Susan Stamberg on
the Grinnell campus prompts reflection
on the role women students have played
in College media, Research indicates
that women have a prestigious history
at involvement in college communica
tions. one dating back over 40 years,

With an active yearbook, radio stae
tion and newspaper to its name, the col-
lege provides ample opportunities tor
student participation in writing and
broadcasting. All three at these have
long histories, The Scarlet and Black
was once known as "the oldest college
newspaper west or the MissiSSlppi,” the
Cyclone lGrinnell yearbook) dates
back to the turn oi the century and the
school's radio station has existed long
enough to merit two changes in call let-
ters.

In all of thae, women have been in-
volved in stall and executive positions
since the 19-10 5. During World War II.
when the enrollment of men in colleges
dropped substantially nationwide,
women students were regularly iound
in editorial/managerial positions as
well as comprising the bulk of the
general statts. The return of men to
school after the war did not deter this.
although It did increase competition for
positions.

During such time Carolyn Swartz. a
graduate oi the class ot 1951, became
the ﬁrst woman to be appointed editor

male student, Swartz, who had worked
{or two years previously on the paper.
was greeted by the paper in the {allow-
ing manner: "Enigmatically speaking,
the situation will bear watchingl Could
it be that a new era in Grinnell jour-
nalism is in the offing? No one can deny
that the female of the species contains a
reiinement oi sensitivity, oiten ape
proaching what is called -intuition.‘
Anyone can see that even the slightest
leaning toward any such supernatural
gilt would he of consummate worth to
an editor." Despite this tongue-in-cheek
reception. Swartz, now Des Moines
trustee Carolyn Bucksbaum, said that
she received a very pleasant reception
and a great deal of support, She added
that it was not uncommon tor women or
hold staii positions, saying oi her
challenge of a male applicant, “1 never
thought a thing oi it when i applied.“-

In the years that followed women
continued to take an interest in Com»
munications at Grinnell. The Cyclone
encountered difficulties at times but for

- the most part continued publication as

did the sea, KGRW, the college's radio
station, had been shut down since the
late ‘405 but in May, 1968 the station was
reopened under, the name KDIC.

Since it was reopened, women have
played a signiiicant part in the station's
history, KDIC's seeond general
manager was temale and women have

held dozens of. stafl positions since.
Presently, KDlC boasts several iemale
students on Its staff, including Program
Director Harriet Chasinsl Chasms, who
previously held the muse librarian
position and has worked as a disc
jockey since her ireshman year, is in
charge oi maintaining the station's 24
hour operations, scheduling each
semester's programs, maintaining rap»
port with and assisting other broad:
casters and general station
maintenance, In addition. she works
with General Manager Dave Buck in
determining station policy. “We try to
come up with things to make KDIC bet-
ter, make it unique, make it important
to the campus." she said. Chasins in-
dicated that She and Buck had equal
say in such matters and added that they .
strongly respect each other's opinions:
She provided a bit of personal
philosophy concerning her role as a
iemale program director "I've always
prelerred to deal with people as
people," she said. "I'd rather just be. 1
the program director." ' ‘
lee KDlC, other groups continue to g
feature women on their staffs. Today-
the S&B‘s editor-in—chiet, news editor,
entertainment editor, copy/layout
editor and ad manager are women and
the paper's staii includes numerous
lemale contributors. Other publica-
tionsnsuch as the Iconoclast and the
Sesquipednlian, feature women swfl'
