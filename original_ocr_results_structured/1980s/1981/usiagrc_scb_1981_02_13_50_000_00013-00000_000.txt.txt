Upon presenting the idea or a written
evaluation to a few people the general
consensus was that it was a good idea.
The problems at evaluating each stu-
dentin a large introductory class would
be pretty big but the beneiits oi being
able to single out speciﬁc students For
speClal consideration «be that good or
bad? would be enormous. I think grad
schools would like the idea of seeing
written evaluations and most teachers
would probably enyoy the option ot put-
ting their opinions down in words as
well as numbers,

The idea 01' forbidding students from
dropping late in the semester because
some oi them might be trying to "beat
the system“ seems like a pretty callous
approach to education tor a "liberal”

me that. the administration could act
