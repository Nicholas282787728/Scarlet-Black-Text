'Anll Inal’s llle way il is’

Since 1962 Walter Cronkite has come into our homes every evening
with the news of the nation. Tonight at 5:30 pm. (Iowa time)
Cronkite’s long and dedicated service as chief anchor of the CBS
evening news program ends.

Many young adults can’t even remember a time when the graying
news veteran wasn’t a central figure in their parents’ evening ac-
tivities. To some he represents a fair and honest father-figure, both
willing and able to bring current events close to home.

But Cronkite’s impact goes beyond his figurehead status. With
relentless enthusiasm Cronkite showed his colleagues how to bring
better, more accurate news to the people. He practiced precision but
at the same time made the news understandable for millions of
Americans.

Cronkite taught us as consumers what to look for in a good televi-
sion journalist and he showed others how to make the news in-
teresting and exciting. On several occasions he publically urged
schools to begin teaching journalism for consumers as well as jourv
nalism for journalists.

Cronkite may not win a medal of honor for his years of service but
he will remain as a strong image in the hearts and minds of both his
viewers and his competitors. Hopefully he will continue to be active
in other capacities so that we may benefit from his knowledge and
wisdom but for now the time has come to wave goodbye to a leader
of no less importance than the president of the United States.
