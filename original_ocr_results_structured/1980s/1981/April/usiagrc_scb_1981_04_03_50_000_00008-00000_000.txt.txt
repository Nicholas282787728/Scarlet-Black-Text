‘ SGA Elections: The. candidates pre

Editor‘s Note: On Wednesday elec-
tions will be held for the positions of
son president and Vice-preSidenl. In
the past, the 5&3 has always interview
ed the candidates but this year we
decided to do something different
Rather than let us determine what are
the important issues that need to be
discussed. We decided to let the can-
didates themselves pick the issues.

SO here it is, All of the candidates
were given the same amount of space
with the vicerpresidential candidates,
as a group, getting a little less room

The candidates

Doug Rowe

One of the main reasons that I am
running for sen president is because
my vice-presidential term turned out to
be so short. This shortness of term has
both disadvantages and advantages. I
feel that I have just begun to get involv»
ed yet it‘s almost over. On the other
hand, I now know that I enjoy it enough
to want to serve for a full year. My
short term as vicepresident is a good
precedent to being president. 1 have
gained necessary and important ex»
perience in dealing with both students
and facility; president isn't a business»
oriented position but one that requires a
willingness to listen, Another advan-
tage to my brief involvement in SGA is
that i still see myself as seeing things
n-om many perspectives. i think that
SGA should be open to all views One of
the main responsibilities of president
and vice-president is the selection of
committee members for the following
year. [haven’t been able to do this yet
and I would like to be able to in order to
insure that they are representative of
the student body. It's important to

Shari Rauland

The position or SGA president is an
important position because it directly
and indirectly influences the lives 01
every student on campus. There is no
periect candidate lor president but i
feel that I am qualified, that l have
good ideas and that I have the right air
titude to be a good president.

AS the SGA treasurer, Finance Com»
mittee chair and a cabinet member this

than the presidential candidates The
candidates statements were not edited
so you are reading exactly what they
wrote,

Russell Pierce has been nominated
for the position of SGA president. As of
when the 5&3 went to press he had not
yet decided whether or not he would 307
cept the nomination.

We hope that you find this an in-
teresting as well as informative way to
find out about the candidates And oh
yes, don‘t forget to vote on Wednesday.

year and with the help of the Finance
Committee. ! was able to convince the
trustees to give the students an extra
517,000, carry out a budget survey and
student interest survey, create a List ol
new services to offer Grinnell and
prepare several budgets. I have also
tried to get non-SGA input and to get
students involved in SGA decistons.
Decision-making is much more effecn

live if the students who have to live with
the decision are allowed to take part in
the deciSion-maklng process.

Because the maiority of sons time
is spent allocating funds, the president
must be experienced with the budget.
lnexperience in this area can lead to a
loss of income. lack of funding for calm
pus groups and poor quality servrces
and social programs

A good president should be able to
present both sides of an issue iairly.
discuss ideas with students. attend to
administrative details, direct students
to sources of help and coordinate com-
mittees. The president must act as a
liason between student. faculty. the ad
ministration and the trustees and be
able to reach students with information
and ask for their input. An SGA presls
dent should be acceSSIble and easy to
talk to. I think it is important to take the
position seriously but still make it en-
Joyable and light for mysell and for
others.

My goals as an sen president would
be to make Grinnell a better place to.
live; to allow students to help make
decisions on issues which interest and
effect them, to make SGA an easier and
more enjoyable place lor students to
come with problems, ideas and ques
tions; and to successfully deal with the
issues and carry out several proyects
during the year.

There are several areas where SGA
should focus. First. SGA should provid-
ed more services and better social pro-
grams. The survey which I designed
allowed Students to give us feedback on
the Finance Committees proposed ser-
vices which I would like to institute next
year The extra $17,000 which we
received from the trustees Will allow us
to make large improvements in the
social life at Grinnell. We have alread)

Hello, I‘m Carleton Knolls, In the
next tew lines 1 will be briefly telling
you who I am, why I am running and
what I would like to see SGA do next
