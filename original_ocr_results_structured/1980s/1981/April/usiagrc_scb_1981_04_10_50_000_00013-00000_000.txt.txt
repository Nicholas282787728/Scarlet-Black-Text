This film, a Christian Theology
Weekend event, IS the story oi a pastor
of a church in a small town in Penn
sylvania who, after reading a story in
Lile magazine, feels compelled to go to
New York City to work with teenagers
involved in gangs. The story centers on
two gangs and the pastor‘s attempt to
build friendships and a sense of trust
between the two groups. His ultimate
gual is to convmce the gangs to stop

although Pat Boone's acting ls at times
corny and a bit unbelievable. the
powerlul and important message
comes through. _ Karen Westgale

What can possibly be said about a
film like The Maltese Falcon? Most of
you have probably already seen it and
plan to see it again, For those of you
who haven't seen it, this is one which
you owe it to yourself to see. It is Hum-
phrey Bogart at his best as Dashiell
Hammetl’s famous detective Sam
Spade. Sydney Greenstreet turns in a
wonderful performance as “the fat
man " and Peter Lorre is just plain fun
to watch as Joel Cairo. Mary Astor
rounds out the cast as Bogey’s client.
This was the first film which John
Huston directed and his talents are ob«
Vious from the start. Huston’s lather,
Waller Huston, also has a small part as
Captain Jacoby. This is undeniably one
of the finest films ever to come out of
Hollywood and should not be missed.
They just don't make lilms like this

Unfortunately I have never seen this
film and apparently nobody else on
campus has either. According to film
critic Leonard Maltin, however, Carol
Kane plays a young Jewish immigrant
who meets her husband in New York at
the turn of the century, only to find that
he has given up on his Old World ways
and expects her to do the same. Mallin
describes it as a “disarmingly simple
story" which has an “outstanding
period llavor.” —— Tom Spackman
