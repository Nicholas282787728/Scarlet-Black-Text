Anyone who went job hunting over break found reduced funding
for summer employment in both federally and nonrfederally funded
positions. In the past, relief could be found in loans and aid to supple-
ment summer earnings but not so for next year. At a time when the
growth of our economy depends heavily upon technological
breakthroughs, the Reagan emphasis is paradoxically squashing op—
portunities.

The outlook appears bleak ~ the new administration enjoys
almost 60 percent national approval, according to national pollsters.
However, the same pollsters also report a higher disapproval rate at
present than even during the Nixon administration!

Believe it or not, Reagan’s staff is relying heavily on its mail as a
barometer for public opinion Several times a week a White House
spokesman quotes the percentage of support for Reagan’s pro-
grams. Recently it was four to one! Is your voice being heard? The
Grinnell College campus community boasts approximately 1,550
people including support staff, which translates into a hefty amount
of 12 cent postcards.

But if each Grinnellian convinced four friends, relatives or sibl-
ings to write similar messages, the number jumps to about 6,000. If
each of those people thought of four others, then the number sudden-
ly rises to 18,000 and so on and so on!

Given the present situation in El Salvador and other hot spots, the
United States could soon become embroiled in one or more senseless
and economically disasterous “conflicts." So the next time you cor
respond with someone outside Grinnell, think hard about where your
tax dollars are going and how a small amount of effort could balloon
into a substantial public outcry.
