I from the editor I

can business govern llle IIS?

As President Reagan begins to carry out his proposed reductions
in government inﬂuence, he thus forces the private sector to call the
shots. But is the private sector able to take on the responsibilities
which Reagan tosses so unceremoniously into its lap?

The function of our government is to give all people equal
representation, whereas the function of private enterprise is to look
out for its own interests. Theoretically, business also ultimately acts
in the public interest because production depends upon a sound coun—
try But the human factor starts where graphs and line drawings
step In the real world only rules and regulations prevent industry
from polluting our rivers or strip mining our forests without
reclaiming the land.

American capitalism means keeping one eye on profits and the
other on costs, all in the short-run, because that is the period which
will make or break any business Although this is not necessarily a
bad way to run a business, a country needs an entirely different
view A nation is an ongoing, long-run establishment whose people
live and work for generations not just quarters or fiscal years.

The private sector should not and cannot run our country today as
it did during the age of the Carnegies and the Rockefellers. Our
precious resources must be guarded for our lifetimes as well as for
those of the people who follow us Unfortunately, turning back the
hands of time is impossible. Like it or not, we must force our govern-
ment to take the responsibility we gave it. The days of tolerating
lassez—faire are dead and gone!
