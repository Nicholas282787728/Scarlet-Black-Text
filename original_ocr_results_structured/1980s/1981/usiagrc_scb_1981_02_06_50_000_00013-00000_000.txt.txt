cus periormer who takes as clovin, cone
cubine and cook a vioman of great
gentleness and innocence. The lilm
studies their inevitable effects on each

grace and the violence involved. The
lilm retains the locus on the problems

trayal ol human relationships that
characterized Necrrealism. Yet there is
also a lantastic mystical element, [ull
oi all the spontaneity. symbolism, in-

helped to loster an importantoutgrowth
