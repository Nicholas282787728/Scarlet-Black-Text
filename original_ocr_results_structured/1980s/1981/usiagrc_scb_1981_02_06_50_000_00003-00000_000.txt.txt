Negotiations continue

Students protest renovation move

by Steve Burnett

No sooner had the second semester
started than residents of Gates and
Rawson Halls were notified that
renovation on their dorms would begin
earlier than expected, They will be
moved to alternate housing on April 4
and 5. Residents 01 Read, who are novt
in the alternate housing, received
notillcation that they would be moved
back into their dorm March 28 and 29.

Many ol the residents feel. however.
that the dates chosen are inconvenient
and, more importantly, the administra
tion has displayed a total disregard ol
the students sentiments. As one
Rawson member put it. They're plays
mg musical bedrooms and they won‘t
let us hear the music."

The students‘ first chance to speak
with the administration was at a
meeting with Director of Housing Susan
Wittpenn on Jan. 25. Gates Hall Presi-
dent Tracy Miller had invited Wittpenn
in discuss the logistics oi the move But
aiter a couple oi preliminary meetings
were held, it became obvmus that what
the students we nted to discuss with Wit-
tpenn was grievances, not logistics

Witlpenn said, however, that she was
not involved in much at the detail of the
actual renovation and many questions
were left unanswered,

President George Drake and vice»
President Jim Tederman then offered
to meet Viltll the students and did last
Tuesday, Feb 3, About 40 Gates,
Rawson and Read residents showed up
lo air their complaints

At the meeting Tederman explained
Ihe administration‘s reasons for the
scheduled moving dates, When Head
renovation vvas started, he said, the
projected time or completion was the
third week in April. That would have

eant moving students two weeks
- -lore finals or laying oil the construc»

ion workers lor three or four weeks. He
did that because the Smith move in
979 was made the first vteek in
iecember it put a hardship on the
tudents while they were studying tor
inals. So the administration decided
hat students must be moved well
lore linals 7 in this case by the iirst

'eek at‘ter Spring Break 7 or not at all,

Tedei‘mdn said the deciswn was then

ade to "speed up" the work on Read

‘hus. the construction workers have
ut in two weeks of overtime and 1m,
roved elimiency, As a result they are
‘ ree weeks ahead of normal schedule,

He went on to explain that ii the col»

ge could not prOVide work lor the

ieu tcontractor and construction

stash; o, l98l

workersi ior three or more weeks they
would look 101’ work elsewhere and the
college "would almost detinitely lose
them " ’l‘ederman stressed that the ad-
ministration wants to keep this crevt [or
a number oi reasons. First, they have
worked on the renovation of all the
dorms and are very good Also they can
do it quicker and better because they
have had practice Finally, according
to 'l‘ederman, the renovation is costing
$25 per square foot as compared to
$5os7s most colleges pay {or this type
of work "Given the set of criteria we
were looking at.” Tederman said,
"there was really no other option."
Still. the students felt the administra-
tion might have been looking at the the
wrong set oi criteria. For instance,

Someone asked ii, after the comple
tion oi Read, the crew could work on
something else. Tederman said, "There
are no projects we could move into "

Read was upset that they have to
move twice in one year in order to save
students next year trom having to move
twice, so the question was put iorth as
to whether Gates and Rawson could
move into Read and Read people could
stay put, Tederman said, "We've made
a commitment with Read members
that when Read is Completed they could
move back in." But he added, "We're
willing to make some arrangements;
we're willing to be flexible"

The Read students were not satisfied
with Tederman's responses and this
was evident when one of the residents

"Given the set of criteria

we were looking at, there

was really no other option.’

Ransoli Hall President Mike Pouios
brought up the issue of MCAT‘S and"
LSATs. Since those tests are given
shortly alter the move, time that could
be spent on studying for them will be
spent on packing and moving, an ob-
vious disadvantage Drake responded
by saying, "Some oi the students are
going to have to sutier We picked these
dates so that as few students as possible
would be affected adversely,"

Marilyn Clark at Gates asked at both
the wittpenn and Drake/Tederman
meetings why the students were not
consulted on this decision, Wittpenn
said, "We haven't consulted any oi the
other dorms about the moves,“ and
Tederman said, ”We can‘t predict any
ultimate date,"

A suggested solution was to renovate
only either Rawson and Gates. Tederr
man said that the plumbing and other
mechanics oi the two dorms are con
nected and both would have to be shut
down When asked about possibly pul-
ling up blockages between the two
dorms, 'l'edel'man said, "it would cost
too much money' and added that it
would not lit in with the way the renova-
tions are being done.

walked up to Drake to give him a petie
tion explaining how angry Read people
are. When Drake reached out to accept
it, the iieadite dropped it to the lloor.

After the meeting many oi the
students were still upset about the "in»
sensmvity” oi the administration.
Miller said, "This is another example 0
the students getting pushed around.
Eugene Kwon of Rawson asked, "Did
you hear what Tederman was saying?
'We‘ve got to worry about the money
that’s being used to pay this project.'
They tell us Grinnell is an open school,
there's a good interaction between the
students and the Iaculty and ad-
ministration and the students come
Iirst. But when it gets right down to it
money makes the decision,"

When asked what the administration
plans to do next, Tedei-man said he
couldn’t say until next week. The
trustees \»ill be in Grinnell today and
tomorrow and Drake said the issue will
be brought before them. He also said
there is an open forum Friday after-
noon where students can talk to some ol
the trustees.
