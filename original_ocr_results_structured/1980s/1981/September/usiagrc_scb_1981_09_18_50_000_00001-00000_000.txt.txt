Handicapped facilities added to campus
College complies with 1973federal law

by Marilyn I. Clark and Steven w. Way

Construction oi wheelchair ramps.
specially equipped lavatories and dor-
mitory rooms undertaken here this sum-
mer at a cost of $50,000 has brought the
college into compliance with a 1m iederal
law mandating equal accessibility to hanr
dicapped individuals, Us. Department oi
Education oiticals recently told the college
administration,

Section 504 of the 1973 law. Wluch relates
directly to educational institutions, deﬁnes
a handicapped person as “any person who
has a physical or mental impairment which
substantially limits one or more major lite
activities“ and requires that "programs
and facilities, when viewed in their entire
ty, be accessible."

The vague nature or this law admittedly
lert a great deal or decision making up, to
college oiiicals so last year a committee
consisting oi Dale i-iawn, director oi the
physical plant, .leit Aldag, a handicapped
Grinnell student. Professor of Education
Beryl Wellborn, Grinnell Hospital Business
Manager Bob Kaloupek. the only member
of the committee confined to a wheelchair

and the services of the architectural firm,
Wuodburn and O‘Neill, was Set up to
evaluate ways of overcoming inaccessible
areas.

“We kept trying to get the goverrunent to
be more specific," said Hawn, chairman of
the committee. “It would obviously have
been impossible to make every square root
of the campus accessible but having the
college be accessible does not mean that
every building has to have an elevator lnr
stalled," Hawn said. “That would really be
a hardship to the college."

For example, it a handicapped student
were to enroll in a class on the third floor of
ARH, which is inaccessible, the class would
instead be held on the first floor of ARH or
ln another building that is equipped for
wheelchairrbound students

Those areas of campus still off limits to
the handicapped such as the Registrar's Ot-
fice, the textbook Section of the Bookstore
and parts or the Physical Education Com-
plex are made accessible by bringing the
services to the student or by the college
providing special help whenever the stu-
dent may need it.

Grinnell has never enrolled students per
manently confined to wheelchairs, Walker,
however. said that the college's position as
a cultural center for the town and the pro
spect oi iuture handicapped students attenr
ding here justiiy the money and time in
vested in the project.

"The accessible facilities are not just for
students but for the public," he said. “We
have public periormances here that we
allow people to come to without buying
tickets

Though the government initially oiiered
to deiray some oi the expenses of construc»
tion, the 1973 and 1980 federal grants
originally intended to help institutions coma
ply with the regulations were depleted.
Thus the college covered the entire $50,000
bill and Walker said the college trustees
were surprised the costs were so low.

“The trustees view spending this money
as very similar to complying with the tire
marshall's regulations," Walker explain»
cd "We just knew it was going to happen so

we were ready for ll." .
One oi the problems confronting the col

A review of the improvements
Accessibility of facilities “above average”

by Marilyn I. Clark and Steven W. Way

Are me new handicapped iacilites at
Grinnell College easily accessible to
students who require a wheelchair? After
testing many oi the new doors, ramps and
bathrooms on campus last Saturday, Sept.
12, me Scarlet and Black's conclusion is,
tor the most part, yes.

Although some people may have thought
the 5&3 was establishing a new Grinnell
tradition 7 the Wheelchair Relays 7 our
purpose was to determine ii a handicapped
person in a wheelchair would have any pro»
blems using the new and modiﬁed facilities
constructed over the summer by various
Iowa firms and the buildings and grounds
staff.

We began our wheelchair investigation in
the Forum. This summer a new bathroom
was installed inside North Lounge. We
found the door to this bathroom difficult to
reach while in a wheelchair because it is
not selfclosirlg. That is. when one enters
the door opens outward not inward, thereby
making it difficult to close. A possible solur
tion may be to install a spring door
mechanism.

We proceeded to leave North Lounge
through the side/crash doors. Although it
was easy to leave through the door, it was a
bit more difficult to get inside. With some
assistance, however, uie doors are accessi~
ble.

The most noticeable addition to the
Forum — the ramps e were tested by a
member of the staff who noted that “the
slope oi the ramp was not too steep going
down" and that he “was not too tired going
up." One problem we did note was that a
handicapped person would have to go out
side if he or she wanted to go from North
Lounge to South Lounge This would be
physically uncomiortahle in the event oi
rain or snow.

We then departed ior south campus. It
was difficult getting up the hill to Quad
from the Forum. Yet two more serious pro-
blems are present on south campus. First.
the ramp going up to Quad inside the loggia

lege during the selievaluation process was
the question oi which types oi handicaps
should be emphasized in the accessibility
project. Section we or the Rehabilitation
Act states that, in addition to considering
persons coniined to wheelchairs and those
whose physical impairments cause them to
walk with difficulty. coordination, sight,
hearing and mental or psychological
disorders should be considered when plann-
ing program accessiblity.

"Someone who is hard of hearing obr
viously does not need accessible toilets,"
Hawn said, The college would. however,
provide transcribed lectures to a deaf Stu
dent and all of the elevators will be accessh
ble to the blind through Braille interpreta»
tions of the buttons, Hawn even learned
sign language himself last year in order to
be able to communicate with a new
employee on the physical plant staff,

Both Hawn and Walker said, had the
government not ordered the acceSSibility to
take place. Grinnell would have gone ahead
with construction voluntarily.

"Grinnell. I think. would have spent that
money for the construction — we probably
wouldn't have done as much over the past
year as we did but I don't think Grinnell
wouldn't have done its all," Hawn stated

is steep. Second, the door by Quad which
leads to East Street is very narrow ior
wheelchairs. The ramp leading to the street
is accessible, however.

Moving to central campus. we checked
the post office, ARH and the library. The
doors to ARH are accessible and the out
door post oiiicc boxes are within easy reach
to handicapped students. Although the in
cline up to the library is quite imposing,
once inside everything irom the doors and
the height oi the card catalog to the
elevator make the library accessible

Overall, in our evaluation, the college
handicapped iacilitics merit an above-
average rating, with the exception oi a iew
narrow doors, a iew steep ramps and the
Forum bathroom door, the college appears
accessible to any handicapped students
who presently or in the tuture use
wheelchairs,

5&3 staff member
Steven Way, although not
handicapped, tested the
access ility of many new
structures on campus in a
wheelchair. Going
through the Forum crash
doors, left, Steven found
them easy to exit but dif-
ficult to enter. At the post
office, right, he tested the
height of the newly install-
ed boxes desrgned
spec Ically for handicap-
ped students and found
them to be within easy
reach. Photo by Barry Jar
