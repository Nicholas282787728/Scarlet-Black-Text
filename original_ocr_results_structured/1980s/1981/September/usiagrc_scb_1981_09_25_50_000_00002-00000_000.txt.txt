Rosenfield Program focuses on

Grinnell’s political and social interests
Second year to feature Meditterranean democracy, Clark on Africa

by Anne Bordanaro

Joseph Wall and a committee or eight
faculty members and live students have
been hard at work planning the were:
Rosenfield Program in Public Affairs,
While only in its second year of existence,
this year's program promises many
outstanding lecture and seminar programs
as well as a new fund for student and faculv
ty research.

The Roseniield Program in Public Afr
(airs was Created by the Board of 'h‘ustees
in 1979 to honor Joseph Roseni‘ield and his
iamily, who have been lifelong friends and
benefactols of the college, Rosenfield, a
trustee since 1541, was made a life trustee
in 1977. His financial expertise and
monetary donations have made Grinnell
one oi the most financially sound colleges
in the country. Louise Roseni‘ield, Joe’s
sister, is also famous as an advocate of
women‘s rights.

Because of the Roselleld’s reputations.
the trustees have been able to solicit a large
amount oi endowment monies, Ultimately.
Joe Wall, director of the Rosenfield Pro
gram, hopes to see the endowment for the
program reach one million dollars, This

year’s budget oi $20,000 is almost double
that oi last year

The Roseniield Program was created to
promote interest and understanding in
three areas oi speciiic interest to the
Rosenfield family: public airairs, interna-
tional relations and human rights. This
task is primarily achieved uirough extra-
curricular events such as seminars and lec-
Lures. However, money is also budgeted to
aid iaculty-student and student research in
these areas. Wall explained that the prev
gram is also intended to influence the cure
riculum oi the college by giving iaculty
members compensation for developing new
related interdisciplinary courses.

Wall said, “It there has been anything
consistent in the whole history of Grinnell,
it has been a continuing interest in the
political and social issues ot the day, going
all the way back to the days when Grinnell
harbored abolitionists," He said, “I believe
this program is illustrative oi the best
tradition in the history oi the college."

Last year, the tirst year oi the program.
there was only enough money to finance the
extracurricular activities such as the two

day series or lectures by former United Nae
tions Ambassador Andrew Young. The
budget has increased this year, funds will
be available for student research and sums
mer internships in addition to a series of
major lectures and symposiums Requests
for these grants should be‘ made to Wall.

Doctors had repr ted improvement yesterday

by Laura Carter

Dick Gilbert, 22, who graduated last spr-
ing with an economics major and the most
valuable men‘s cross country member
award, died at approximately 10:30 pm.
Thursday in a Kansas City hospital irom
complications developed atter a tall while
painting a Grinnell house Aug, 10. After
spending over three weeks at Iowa
Methodist Hospital in Des Moines, he was
transierred to Menorah Hospital in Kansas
City, Mo Gilbert had been in a coma since
the accident and doctors reported Wednesr
day he had been able to hear and was
responding well

At this time no plans have been made ior
funeral or burial arrangements

The accident, according to Grinnell
students David Molho and Helen Michel,
occurred as Gilbert and Bruce Feichtinger,
also or the class of ’81. were painting the
home oi Stan and Charlene Thomsen at 1404

Broad st. The two had erected a two-story
scaiiold, on which they placed ladders to
reach the third floor, At approximately 5:45
pm the scaiiolding tipped, without warn-
ing, as a result oi the horizontal pressure or
the ladders,

The ladders under both men then bent,
causing Feichtiriger to iall and land on his
ieet. He suiiered a gash to his forehead niat
required eight stitches, a deep cut in his leg
and a sprained wrist. After examination at
Grinnell General Hospital he was treated
and released.

Gilbert, however, caught his ieet in the
rungs of a ladder and hit the concrete below
him on die leit side of his face and lett
shoulder. He lost consciousness immediate»
ly and lapsed into a coma. Dr James R,
Paulson was able to come right to the scene
irom his house on the next block and
Gilbert was taken to Grinnell General
Hospital by ambulance,

Social calendar too full

“Too many special weekends
cease to be special”

Alter examination there. he was flown to
the Des Moines hospital, where he remains
ed until Sept. 1, During this time he was in
and out of intensive care, because he
developed pneumonia, lost a lot of weight
and was lighting the respirator. He also
had a tracheotemy. His condition improv-
ed. however, as Jean Ann Thomsen,
li‘ryearrold daughter oi the home owners,
reported. “On the Monday beiore he was
taken to Kansas City, a lot of college
students visited him and told him they
would tickle him until he made a motion in
his right hand, Pretty soon his pinky really
started to move.H

He was trani‘erred to Menorah Hospital
because his father, Edward Gilbert, lives in
Shawnee Mission, a suburb, and his
mother. Carol Harris, from Arizona, could
live wiu1 a brother there. Michel also said a
neurological specialist was also available
there to provide special treatment After
the transfer, though, Gilbert began to
regress and his lung collapsed,

A meeting called last week to confront
the problem of a cluttered social calendar
resulted in promised eiiorts on the part oi
campus special interest groups to get their
activities on the calendar as early as possi-
ble. Social Coordinator Allison Paich said
in a Wednesday interview.

Paich, who said about 20 groups leaders
attended the meeting, expressed her con-
cern that the calendar be organized and
well planned and reminded those attending
that “it you schedule too many special
weekends they cease to be special and
become commonplace.”

“Last year we experienced problems
when one special interest group decided to
show a movie or sponsor another activity
when something else had been planned well
in advance,” Paich said.

“The immediate thing that came out oi
the meeting is that German House agreed
to sponsor one weekend instead oi its usual
two, and Spanish House did the same,” she
said. “At least it let them know of the cons
cern on our part,"

Palch, who works with a Student Govern-
ment Association budget totaling more
than 57.500, described her position as be»
in me “ overnmental art of the social

programming." a liasion between input
from students, faculty and the SGA.

Paich and Performing Program and Ac-
tivities Counselor Georgia Dental work
together to schedule concerts. decide the
types of bands that will be hired and insure
that a variety of musical preferences be
represented. “Georgia goes through her
contracts and finds out what bands are in
the area and men Sell tells Peter and Benn
nett (coconcert chairmen Peter Fry and
Bennett Lasko)" Paich said. "I have the
final say on which hands We sign on. so if l
wanted to be terrible I could put my foot
down against one band or another, but that
really never occurs."

Four major concerts have already been
planned for this tall and ior January, in-
cluding jazz artist Gary Burton on Oct. 3,
the Big Twist and Mellow Fellows band on
Nov. 14 and jazz/rock lusionist Jeff Larber
on Nov. 2!. Scheduled for Jan. 30 is David
Grismond, who originally scheduled ior
this month but was unable to perform
because oi a preemptive Australian tour.

“We scheduled everything that will be on
this fall over the summer and some of the
bands were chosen in May.” Paich said
“The only time when we can get these
groups is when they are coming through or
have been la in ne r
