The management oi Harriet Chasins, An-
thony Murry (programming), Chris Ertel
(production), Rett Britt tmusic), Mary
Schulze (news) and Kevin McKeough
(publicity) will attempt to upgrade the sta-
tion equipment and personnel in order to
make KDlC, in Chasins' words, “more imr
portant and relevant to the campus and
Grinnell " And thus tar, Kch appears to

be movi gin Lhatdi ect n.

Unfortunately, technical problems con-
tinue to plague the station Management
cites outmoded equipment as the source of
the problem. Replacements are too expen-
sive for the $3,500 semester budget, so the
stall has opted in iavor of repairs and slow
replacement as an alternative. To upgrade
and expand KDIC‘s severely delicient
record library, Music Director Rett Britt
has placed KDIC in the College Media Jourr
nal which should expose the station to the
major record companies (Atlantic, Colum-
bla and Warner Brothers to name a few).

News at KDIC is also improving, Mary
Schulze is currently operating With 13
reporters covering special events, ad
ministration and student lite and campus
news in general, The news can be heard atﬂ
3.111., 4 p.m. and 10,30 p.m in addition to
Associate Press bulletins throughout the
day

screen, everything else pales in com»

experienced to be fully appreciated, tor its
larger than lile size really can't be describ-
ed, Streisand at her dynamic best should be
seen at any price,

An equally line periormance is given by
Sissy Spacek in Coal Miner's Daughter. the
biography oi Loretta Lynn. in this movie,
Spacek becomes Lynn as she recreates her
lite from age 13 to 33. The movie contains a
gripping realism throughout, particularly

or less lucky schoolmates and’lhe tinal
result is a beautitul poetic evocation oi
childhood. By all means, this is a ﬁlm to

Though The Red Balloon is probably the
most famous oi the iilms, the others have
also received a great deal oi acclaim. Two

White Mane is the allegorical story or a

capture and tame him, and the boy who
succeeds in taming him with love. The
Golden Fish is a suspensetul tantasy or a
boy, his pet goldfish and a cat who comes,
when the boy is away. Both tilms are as
