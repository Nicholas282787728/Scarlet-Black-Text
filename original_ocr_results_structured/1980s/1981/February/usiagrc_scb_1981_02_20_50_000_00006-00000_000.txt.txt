JB debates fire extinguisher policy

by Bob Utke

Jomi. Board was divided over issues
concerning the punishment lor
discharging lire extinguishers as
Wednesday nights session got down to
business. .18 considered the policy to
the Student Handbook which was sent
from the Committee on Student Life,

The change, as proposed by Joint
Board. would have made false fire
alarms, setting tires and tampering
with the tire alarm systems violations
that would be taken to the President's
Hearing Board and subject to penalty
up to and including expulsion.

it was moved to accept this policy
which [illed the bulk of the tlvo and ones
halt hour meeting. Bill Stowe added a
friendly amendment that changed the
wording so that the policy prohibited
the "malicious" lighting of fires. Next,
Chris Nylander made an amendment
that would move the judicial respon-
sibilities from the President's Hearing
Board, the highest "court" in the Grin-
nell judiciary process, to the All College
Judicial Council, the body which
handles most student violations.

An attempt failed to strike the portion
oi the policy which referred to
discharging fire extinguishers This
motion was made by George Turnhull,
who felt that lire prevention would
result lrorn adequate warning systems
and the issue was not "a question of
how hard you slap someone's hands."
The policy, with violations, was passed

as amended, by a roll call vote of 9577,
since the policy has been amended by
the Jomt Board, it must return to CSL
for reconSlderatlon.

Another major item was a revision ol
the Election Procedure Ey-Laws The
proposal was submitted by lormer
Election Board Chair Julia McCray. lts
major goal was to limit the number oi
runolls. The original revrsion included
among its guidelines a requirement
that each candidate must submit a pair
tion with 200 names on it. McCray ex
plained that this would give each can
didate , a chance to campaign
without seeming pushy. ‘

This issue was questioned and
criticized in a number of different
lights. The general consensus was that
it made running for office too dillicult a
process and would serve to cut down the
number oi candidates both good and
bad, In a vote Ol 11-9-1 the portion re»
quiring a petition was struck from the
revisions.

Promising to make some real
changes in the system, Turnbull made
an amendment that would require the
president and vicerpresident to run on a
single ticket. Turnbuil argued that this
would allow for a more compatible
working relationship between these two
oiiices. At one point, while defending
his amendment, Turnbull exclaimed,
"I stole it irom Paul (Volkerl and wrote
it up!" There was a feeling among the

representatives that, the new twists
deserved more student input and the
motion was postponed until next week.

Before moving on to the next item on
the agenda. SGA President Paul Volker
stated, "One ot the things that makes
sGA a yoke on campus is that the elecn
tion procedures are all lucked up "
Later he added, "My understanding is
the student body wants a change in
their election committee and l tee] this
change is needed ”

Also on the agenda, SGA approved
Andrew Cameron as Administrative
Assistant/Election Board Chair, Brad
Lyons and Susan Bart were approved
as representatives to the Committee on
Corporate Responsrbllity.

In the President's Report. Volker an-
nounced that March 4 has been picked
as the date let an Open Forum on the
FrGrade, Student Coordinator Teri
Gould reported that her office would be
running a liquor shuttlei Thursday,
Feb 19.

Loose Hall requested lunding lor the
Loose Hall Ball. They asked $1623 87
and received the entire amount. The
budget was higher than expected
because the administration asked that
they hire an auxiliary security lorce

Nylander stated that they would be
unable to bring Santana since they were
charging $15,000 a concert. He Said that
they were looking at several other
bands.
