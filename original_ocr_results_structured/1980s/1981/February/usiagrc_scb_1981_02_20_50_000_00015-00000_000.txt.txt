A Grinnell Point/counter point: Guii Contra

Bill Stowe

In the wake oi the tragic death oi
John Lennon and the media locus on the
reassertlon pl militant reactionary
groups, once again the cry among my
“liberal" brethren to control handguns
is deafening. But aside from the tenden-
cy oi both pro and anti-gun control
debaters to cariacature their adverr
saries, there are undeniable dill‘iculties
\\ hich make gun control undeSirable, ll
not impossible.

Proponents or restrictive legislation
blind themselves to the Simple fact that
most gun owners villi not submit to
registration. New York 7 which boasts
"the toughest gun control laws in the
nation” , reportedly harbors some one
to two million illegally owned hands
guns. Few of thue handgun owners
are either hardened criminals, militant
right-wingers or paranoid property
owners, many oi them are target
shooting enthusiasts who enjoy the
harmless pastime of stalking paper
targets in the safe contines oi a shooting
range,

it‘s argued by many that handguns
are by their very nature potentially
deadly weapons and, therelore, are a
menace to society. Given, then. that
registration has been unsuccessiui,
why not outlaw handguns 7 or it we
really want to be "progresstve, why
not ban all guns? Without a transconr
tinental magnet, gun control is imposs-
ible. If we can learn any lessons from
those states in which gun controls exist,
with nearly 200 million firearms in the
United states in quarter of them hands
gunst, it would take an enforcement
authority acting in violation ol the
Fourth Amendment to lerret out even a
signiticant number oi these guns. ’l‘o
enact legislation which clearly is
disregarded by so many is absurd and,
ii gun control laws were strictly eniorc
ed, the effects of enforcemenl would be
more harmful than the abuses which

controls seek to remedy, Either way
gun control is a moral abomination or
at best a legal miscalculation.

I am soberly aware of the deadly
abuses oi firearms. Many deaths and
injuries caused by gun abuse are ac
eldental and outside of an impossible
ban on firearms are unavoidable until
gun owners are aware oi the incredible
destructive potential oi their weapons.
The firearm industry should be en
couraged to take a iar more active role
in better informing owners oi necessary
precautions in the care and storage oi
guns,

Gun control, to combat the criminal
who intentionally uses a lirearm to
harm others, is ineffective even assum-
ing that weapons prohibitions are en»
l'orceable. Many criminologists, such
as Proi. Marvin Wolfgang. the leading
expert on homicide, believe that
homicide rates would not be Significant
ly reduced ii guns magically disap-
peared. as Mark Bennenson, the
former chairman of the US section of
Amnesty international, has written,
"because pulling the trigger is the last
volitional act that precedes a gun
homicide, attention naturally tocuses
on the firearm but the basic causes of
homicide are too deeply rooted to be at-
l'ected by selecting a weapon." Even it
we do not accept the arguments oi these
eminent men and believe that criminal
sanctions could be a deterrent to
homicide, mandatory sentencing provi-
sions which increase the penalties ior
crimes where firearms are used seem
far more reasonable.

ll inroads are to be made in the
senseless inyuries and killings that are
blamed on firearms, we must en-
courage more prudent gun ownership.
But most important, we must not blind
ourselves to the social factors which
perpetuate Violent crime. Before the
criminal chooses a weapon, a liieiong
series oi personality and enVironmental
factors have made the crime certain

The idea behind gun control is not to
deny hunters dieir sport. The intent
behind gun control is the abolition of
handguns, which cannot be used to
hunt The purpose behind riiles and
shotguns is not to kill people. The ex
clusive purpose or a handgun is to kill
human beings,

It. has been asserted that us. citizens . ‘

have the constitutional right to bear
arms, The Founding Fathers did not in-
tend this nation to have a standing ar~
my thus the citizenry was given the
right to bear arms as a militia in order»
that they may deiend the nation. Argus
ing tor the right to bear arms in that
context in today's world is silly. Anyone '

who thinks that his Smith 5: Wesson .38 ' ‘

is going to stop an invading army has
another guess coming, There seems to
be no constitutionally grounded argu.
ment to support handgun ownership '
among Americans. »
It is very easy to play with murder'
statistics and use them to make asser- ’
tions on either side oi the gun control

argument. But the simple straightfor: , .

ward (act of the matter is that hand-
guns exist tor no other purpose but to
kill people, As a society, we will not be
able to eliminate guns completely,
There will always be those who are so
determined to commit a crime with a
gun that no law will deter them.

It is our Job as civilized, rational
members oi society to iind a way to
reduce the number of murders that
take place using handguns in our coun-
try each year. Most people who are
murdered in this nation are killed by
people they know during some sort oi
confrontation The murderers are sane
citizens who. had the handgun not of»
iered such a quick way to settle the
score, would have'had time to cool off
and rethink their actions,

Not only must the United States act to
abolish established, name-brand hand-
guns but, in order to give any teeth to
an antirhandgun measure, the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms must
be given more strength so that it may
have the capabilities to raid and shut
down illegal and black market handgun
producers and sellers. whereas there is
that element of our society that will
employ a handgun for its own personal
use. the idea behind these proposals is
to reduce the number at murders to the
lowest possible. We cannot eliminate
murders in this nation but We certainly
can make it harder to Commit onel

Arguments over handgun control
seem to me to be pomtless. The simple
fact of the matter is that handguns
serve one and only one purpose: to kill
people, Thereiore, I can see no reason
law-abiding citizens would oppose
handgun controls,
