Academic dismissals /suspensi0ns rise

by Tom Lenk

At the beginning or the semester
rumors ran rampant about the number
of students who had been suspended or
dismissed for academic reasons; some
even placed the number as high as 100.
While this was an exaggeration. ligures
from the Registrar's Office do indicate
that the total was higher than it had
been [or at least the past ﬁve
semesters. Fourteen ,students were
dismissed and 20 were suspended for a
total DI 34. This number continues what
appears to be a trend in dismissals and
suspensions. Totals tor the past live
semesters are (in reverse order) 34, 32,
i7, 20, and seven.

Dean of Student Allairs Jim Tederr
man felt that the rumors were Continuar
tions of those started at the end of first
semester. "We had some withdrauals
and leaves come after {all br ak last
semester," he remarked, “That's
unusual, Since no refund is given after
that time. Anyway, i remarked about
this at a faculty meeting and I think
that's when the rumors started'

Many of the rumors have placed the
blame for the number ol suspensmns
and dismissals on Dean of the Faculty
Catherine Frazer, claiming that She
has put pressure on the Iaculty to crack
down 'on students academically, Frazer
dismissed that allegation With the come
merit, "It's very tiattering to knovl that
people think i have that kind ol poker
but I've been dean too long and in too
many places to take that type of thing
seriously.” She also maintained that
her ellect on the Academic Standing
Committee would be small as she has
only a tie-breaker vote, The association
oi her name with toughness, Frazer
felt, came as a result of her inheriting
the Fvgrade question, something it hich
had been "sitting in the wmgs" even

before her arrival at Grinnell last fall. '

Professors Gene Wubbels and Gerald
LaLonde, both members oi the
Academic Standing Committee, tended
to agree with these statements.

Tederman also said that vihile the
large number oi suspensions and
dismissals was a cause for concern, he
did not feel it to be a major problem
because of the Cumulative nature of the
cases. "Except for three or four cases,
and there are aiuays a levy judgment
calls, 1 think all oi these students viould
have been given the same treatment by
any other Academic Standing Commit-
tee," he pointed out. "This is especially
true of the dismissals You'almost have
to work at it to be dismissed irom the
college. The problem with those people
is motivational not ability, They could
do the work if they wanted to "

Wubbels ielt that the use 01 com-
puterized student records may have
speeded things up a bit and given the
impression or increased strictness.

However, he stressed that 'there is no
interest or recognized policy to stilien
standards, at least not in that viay
lsuspending and dismissmg students)
I think Deaii Frazer viants [0 define the
standards more exactly. ’

i-iavmg served on the committee for
the 1969-70 academtc year as well as tor
the past tut) years, Wubbels was able to
offer some historical background on the
subiect He thought the seven
dismissals live semesters ago vves "on
the lovi side of the figures” and that the
last tho semesters uere simply a tame
porary peak. 1 seem to remember
about 15 or so being the average
number. I think it’s Just coincidence
that the high numbers came when they
did,

LdLoiide is on the committee tor the
lust time this year but he thinks that
the committee is more Consistent than
in the past years and that this may have
had some effect on the number oi
students suspended "i can't be sure,“
he said. "But Irom reading student tiles
it seems that there may have been in
consistency in the past in the ccmmio
lee's reversal oi suspensions in a small
number oi cases. LdLonde sees
definite benefits with the new policy. He
relerred to instances in the past vihere
suspensions had been overruled simply
because the committee changed its
mind VHtl‘lDut the introduction of any
nen evidence. Such a reversal meant
that the student could return to Grinnell
uithoui the required trial period
somewhere else. "Then the student
comes back to Grinnell and really
blous it,' he added, .

“I guess you could say that there are
new teeth in the same rules,” said
LaLonde in summing up his ieelmgs
about the committee‘s operations. 'But
there are no men rules. ’

Part ol the problem is also thought to
be due to changes in student attitudes
Students are much more likely to drop
courses itithout thinking about it than
in past years. according to 'I‘edermdll.
He also noted that there are aliiays
some students uhu iaii at the last
minute to take a line] exam or hand in a
required paper, l-lovi ever, he nus qmck
to add that this accounts lor only a
minority oi the students dismissed and
suspended

LaLtinde thought that there has it
greater amount oi uhai he termed
“personal interierence' iiith students
educations He remarked that he has
talked to students who didn't really
\Aant to (time to college but are ulten;
ding because oI parentiil pressure
Some others, he said. are not mature
enough at age 17 and 13 to undertake the
kind of cork that college study entails.
LtiLuntie pointed out that these descrip'
lions don‘t cover a maturity oi the

students but a "signiiicdni lillliurlt).
He lhen added, That 5 what lhe Cums

The present grading system. in itli the

also Indicted. Wubbels relei'red to it as
u 'lender trap and 'l‘ederiiiuii uom~
merited that ”it tum mislead students

LaLnnde \\elil on at ieiigth "The pre

‘i‘ederniun also pointed out that there
tire Indications other than the number
oi students suspended and dismissed
Vil‘llL‘h can be used as u measure til
academic pressure. He Iell that our
phasis should be placed on the number
ol uithdravials ”the thing that uould
concern me most is an increase in the

viitlidravials iias only one higher than

’i‘oidi attrition, vihich IS another ini-

at the college “as Cited by 'l‘edernian

Grinneil's total attrition lor the Ilrsl

man, many schools commonly ex»
