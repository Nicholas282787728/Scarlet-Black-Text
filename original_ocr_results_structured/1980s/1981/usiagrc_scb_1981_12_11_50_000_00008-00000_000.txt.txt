Wade sat alone on a park bench fac-
ing a pond in which ducks placidly
floated. Jenny sat alone on a park
bench a few feet away, also facing the
pond. Wade always came to the park
on Sundays to faithfully feed the
ducks. Jenny always came to the park
on Sundays to read a book.

Wade was a big man with short
brown hair and sunken little brown
eyes. His clothes were tacky. His tie
was green with yellow-orange polka
dots. The tie didn't hang straight. and
the tie pin was haphazardly situated.
Wade’s shabby beige coat was adorned
with a single flower. The flower was
bent over. drooping listlessly towards
the ground. The flower was dying. Its
hours were numbered. Wade’s, hours
were numbered too. .Wade did not like
himself very much. ‘ ’ ‘ ‘

Jenny was plain. She wore her dull .

brown hair fastened back in a tight
bun. Jenny’s blouse was a faded blue,
yet it was freshly cleaned and ironed.
Not a crease could be found in her sim~
ple virgin white skirt.

Wade was in his late thirties. Wade
was lonely. Jenny was in her early
thirties. Jenny was lonely too.

As a distant church bell rang, Jenny
closed her book and stood up. Wade
glanced at his watch, although he
already knew it was four o’clock.
Wade stood up. It was almost time.

The two strangers milked towards
each other on the paved path. Jenny's
heartbeat quickened. Maybe today he
will say hello to me, she thought.
Wade’s palms becarne moist. He tried

to straighten his tie, but his plump
fingers were clumsy and only made to
look worse. Today is the last chance;
she had to notice me today. Wade
thought.

Only two more paces, and they
would be close enough to touch. Both
hearts were pumping furiously in elec»
tric nervousness. Only one more step.
But with that step, both heads bent
down, eyes on the pavement, as if it
was a wondrous new discovery. With
the third step they silently passed
each other; neither was aware that the
other was holding his breath.

When Jenny went to the park the
next Sunday she found a section of the
previous Monday’s newspaper. A
headline caught her eye. “Man Jumps
Off Building, " she read. The article
stated that on Sunday, around four
thirty, a Mr. Wade Cline jumped head
first from a' building. Tossing the
paper into the garbage can, Jenny sat
down on her familiar bench, opened
her book, and began to wait patiently
for her nameless dream man to come
to the park and feed the ducks.

In the flatlands we walk with giants

white columns of clouds all around

march forward with us toward the next floodplain
then disappear among the hills those strange hoizons

From every direction five, even eight gleaming giants 7
a tumbling row, a towering cumulous escort

taking each step with us in wheat rowsr

corn rows, over the next highest things,

white grain elevators. limestone churches,

silent companions, unprotecting, unreproachful.

Who could be so proud in their midst

to say he is his own lord

when water and shade stride
iust out of touch before him?

Who could be too meager a human

to ever slump or feel alone

having ridden in state with a gleaming giant
on a vast plain on a sleek black road
and seen its images, too, in mirage

making the way?
