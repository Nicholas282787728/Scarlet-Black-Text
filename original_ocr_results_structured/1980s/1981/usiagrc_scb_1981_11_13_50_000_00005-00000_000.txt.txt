To the Editor:

After reading your story on the Food
Service last \teek. I felt compelled to coin»
ment on tls accuraci

First. when a quote "Our lood service is
very good" is used, i think it would be only
talt- to print the entire quote Any time i
ever say that our limit : t‘VlCe is very good.
i also say without licsitation. "them is
always room tor improvement "

Second, it you would compare this year's
cycle menu with last year's cycle menu,

we can gain a perspective on tragedies ace
curring not only in El Salvador but
throughout the world as well.

I lived iii the northern part of Honduras
this summer i've never been in a refugee
camp, but one doesn‘t have to see
malnutrition in order to see children bur,
icring irom kwashiorkor, a type oi protein
deticiency that leaves permanent scars.

one school teacher in Santa Rosa dc
Copan [old me that when the rainy season
comes the death rate of the children
skyrockcts.

Currently this is the rainy season in Can
tral America Tile temperature drops to so
or below. It rains every day The
makeshift root leaks and the kids don't
have enough blankets Under these condi-
tions many children die oi even simple it-
lnesses They don't have the reisitance to
light diseases that are considered minor
here

What worries me IS how a country
poorer than El Salvador can handle the
great influx oi Salvadorian reiugees. Hone
dui-as and other [,enlrul American coun~
tries cannot see to the needs til the

reiugccs on their own. Help must come
from the outside

It is sadly ironic. that we. the U 8.. who
could afford to otter a home lor the victims
at [his civil war In El Salvador, depart the
reiugees

A number ol organizations, both
religious and humanitarian. are working
in the refugee camps COSES, the network
we are nssoclasted with, has been one of
the most citcctiye in getting tood,
medicine and medical supplies to El
Salvador.

Next week SASES will have tables set up
in the dining halls. the Forum and the post
office Volunteers will be distributing
literature. answering questions and taking
donations There will also be a sit show.

"H09 Fest

To the Editor.

There‘s a new game in town. Its called
"Act slupid and make lots of friends by
deiacing the publications and insulting the
ciiorts oi groups which are working at
something they believe in."

One oi the most blatant examples oi this
is the new crave, the HOG FEST. Organize
ed by a group oi students who have nothing
betlei‘ to do with their time [han to waste
it. the HOG FEST lsa perverted derivative
of this year's FOG Fast. In order to join,
all one has to dots lgnorantly snuff the eta
forts oi the Catholic Students Group, which
is ustng the FOG Fast to raise lunds {or
MICA, decide that anyone distributing
literature and asking ior signatures is
stupid and take the HUG FES'l‘organlzer‘s
oath. "I join the HOG FEST because I
want my food,”

When Dave Molho and the South African
Support Group hash out the divestment
issue. they are using the high quality in-
telligence that has helped to give Grinnell
its name When the basketball, looloatl
and lield‘hockey teams play their respeo
live sports. participants cxcel in physical
and mental exercise that each player can
take with him or her throughout the rest oi
his or her life.

when students get together to organize
things like the HOG FEST, they are excetlr
ing in simple, pattietic stupidity.

Everyone has a right to have a good
time Good times are the goal oi most of
our activities, whether they be going to the
pub. streaking or taking a Strauber
Course But have we gotlclt [0 [he point
where "good time" includes doing oilen-
sive things like the HOG FEST?

But alas. i become ignorant and as “‘1”er
tional as those who have organized such an
ingomiinous cyciit. For i ask cveryone- ll
you see any oi the iormutatoi-s oi this new
activity peddling their cause. tell them to
go to hell 7 Bill ogityie

with examining what we ttlink about
ourselves and ltov. we can improve our

a chance to spend sometime on ourselves

sidered a luxury at Grinnell. This will be a
sell-h lp support group, which means that
parti pation by all members will be ot the
utmost importance. Participation is
limited to seven people. Please contact me
