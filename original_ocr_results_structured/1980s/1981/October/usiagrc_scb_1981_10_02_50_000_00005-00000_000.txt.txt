‘ An insider’s view of South Africa

The divestment question

I found last week’s article “Corporate
involvement is best alternative” by David
Molhe very upsetting and highly naive.

U.S. investments in South Africa are in
very strategic positions. For example,
Ford manufactures military cars; I,B.M.
supplies the government with computers
used to keep track of blacks; US. Steel is
vital for mineral mining and trans
sportation. The fact that these companies
are in strategic positions is evidenced by
the recent advertisements placed in the
Wall Street Journal by the South Africa
government in an ongoing campaign to

_,persuade U.S. companies nut to divest.

K So Ford is doing a little window dressing
here and there by promoting a handful of
blacks. The real effects of Ford’s presence
in South Africa are demonstrated where
Ford-supplied military vans and equip
ment are used in such endeavors as the
killings in Soweto in 12116 and in 1981, the
ongoing raids to keep black women and
children in the Bantustans and black men
alone in the city and the recent raids in
Angola which left more than 1,000 blacks
dead. The handful of blacks promoted by
Ford is surely homing compared to the
lives this company has helped the South
African government destroy.

Mr. Molho criticizes Polaroid's
divestment but I am glad it divested.
Passbooks are one of the most

Lhenever I hear me term “poli sci,” I

dehumanizing inventions of South Africa’s
apartheid regime and Polaroid was
manufacturing these passbooks. It was
wrong for Polaroid to dehumanize the
black South Africans on behalf of the whlte
supremacist South African government.
The companies are helping a few thousand
blacks and at the same time destroylng 20
million others. Divestment will mean
short~term suffering (or South Africa‘s
blacks but will lead to longsterm freedom.

I am from Zimbabwe, a country which in
1930 gained its independence and rid itself
of apartheid. US companies divested and
economic sanctions were imposed on
Zimbabwe. We suffered for a few years but
due suffering after divestment was nothing
compared to the freedom we have now.
The South African blacks have called for
divestment through the voices of Steve
Blko, Bishop Tutu and the ANC leader
Oliver Tambo, to name a few. They know
best what's good for them,

Divestment is the only humane and
socially sound way to go. Mr. Molho claims
that divestment would neatly be ridding
ourselves of the problem. I disagree
because divestment will help to get the
South African government on the
bargaining table. It is the only way to help
South Africa to change Without as much
bloodshed as I saw in Zimbabwe.
