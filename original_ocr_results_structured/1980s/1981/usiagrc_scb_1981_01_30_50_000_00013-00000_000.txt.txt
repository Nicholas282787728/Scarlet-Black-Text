Tankers gear up for Grin relays

by Peter Hautzinger

As he leads his squad into this
weekend's Grinnell Relays, men‘s
swimming coach Ray Obermiller an-
ticipates an excellent, closely contested
meet.

Obermiller, swimming coach for the
past 15 years, said that although “Last
year's team was the best I’ve ever had
at Grinnell, mis year's bunch has the
potential to be even better." The team
is an interesting blend of tried and true
veteran talent and young, up—and-
coming swimmers who appear to be
making rapid progress.

The swim team, for years one of Grin-
nell's most competitive squads, is led

we’ve MOVED!

uiis year by captains Kirby Schaufler
and Bruce Pivar. Obermiller called
Brian Ross, school record holder In five
events, “one of the very best swimmers
I‘ve ever had here.” He also puts senior
Tom Helpenstell in this elite category.
Helpenst/Bll, the defending national
champion in onermeter diving, has been
an All~American in each of his four
years at Grinnell, Other team leaders
are Rick Stuck, Hugh Deaner and Steve
MacFarlane. Obermiller feels that
freshmen brothers Steve and Peter
Block have the potential to become
outstanding swimmers.

The team is coming off a two week so-
journ to Florida, which was taken over
winter break. For the last four years
the team has gone south over break in
an effort to break the monotony that
goes hand in hand with training every
day in the same surroundings. It also

provides the opportunity to work out in
a someter pool, which makes swimm-
ing in Grinnell’s 25-meter pool seem
like taking a pleasant afternoon stroll
when they return. “I really feel that
this program is of immeasurable value
to our swimmers,” obermiller said.

when discussing the upcoming Grin»
nell Relays, Obermiller thinks that
Rockford College. the University or
South Dakota and William Jewell will
otter the stiflest competition. “They‘ve
all had more meets than we have and
they race with a lot more experience in
some events. We’ve been working hard
but it’s difficult to predicth we’ll do
this weekend.” The Grinnell Relays
promises to be the best home meet at
the year and as Obermiller said, it
should be “just an awfully good com-
petition." _

statesmen took control of the offensive

William Penn was led oriensively by
Gerald times 29 points. who con—
sistently uiwaited any hopes of a Grin-
nell comeback with his outside
shooting. Grinnell was led by Pat Walsh
and Curt Pabst. who each contributed
it points. Dave Nash, hot in the waning
minutes oi the game, iinished with 10
points.

Walsh also led in rebounding, grabo
ing 10. Brian Samore pulled down nine.

Last weekend, the team traveled to
Wisconsin {or an unsuccesstul two-
game trip. The men dropped a 106-42
decision to Beloit College, ranked third
