This is the last issue of the 8&1} for the semester. We hope that the
paper has been both informative and entertaining and maybe even
provocative every once in a while. As always, we both welcome and
encourage your comments about the paper. It is important for us to
know what our readers think, so when you really like something or
you feel like you want to bomb our offices 7 please let us know.

As a personal aside, (here comes the self-serving part), we’d like
to thank all of the people who helped put out the paper this past year.
The rewards are few and far between and your participation was
greatly appreciated. Thank you. Also, we‘d especially like to thank
Tom Lenk, first semster editor, and Anne Rawland, second
semester editor, they put in untold hours of work and their devotion
to the paper set an excellent example for all of us to follow.

This issue also marks the end of the newsmagazine format, You’ve

’ probably heard some rumors about next year’s S&B so let us set the

record straight. Beginning next semester the 5&8 will return to a
newspaper design with eight full»sized pages. We feel we’ll be better
able to cover what’s happening all over campus with this new format
and we’re looking forward to the challenge of a new design.

As we start now to prepare for some of next year’s changes we
still have positions open on the paper, If you would like to apply to be
a columnist or cartoonist please submit a sample of your work to the
editor or our mailbox in the post office. Or, if you just want to
become a staff writer — please drop us a note.

So until Friday, Sept. 4 . . . have a good summer.
