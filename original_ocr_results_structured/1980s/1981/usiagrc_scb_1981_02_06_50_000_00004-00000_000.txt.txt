Dorms report security woes

by Kevin L. McKeough

improperly locked doors to a number
of residence halls have caused pro-
blems tor their student occupants. At
present, access to dorms with unlocked
doors is the greatest ilaw in the campus
security system.

Loose nail in particular has exr
perienced diiriculty, One oi the largest
halls on campus, its Size and the
presence of a laundry room make it, in
Hall President Chuck Gregg‘s words,
"the most traveled dorm there ls "
More importantly the several en-
trances to Loose are not locked con-
sistently. Gregg said he felt that the ac-
ceSSibility of the hall through those en,
trances made it easier [or problems to
occur in the hall, This semester two col
lege women were harrassed by a man
who managed to enter the hall late one
weekend evening, in addition three
telephones have been stolen [mm the
hall since classes began.

South Younkers Hall experienced thl
same problem last semester when roui
telephones were removed irom the hall
one weekend evening, Former Hall
President John Nelson said it was very
unlikely that the phones were taken by
hall residents, pointing out that their
absence cut the entire hall on from the
rest of the campus and added that the
phones were oi no use to students.
Nelson said it Would have been easy (or l
a nonrstudent to have removed the
phones because some doors to
Younkers Hall were often unlocked at
night. "It’s really easy to get into the
halls," he added,

Younkers and Loose Halls are not the 5
only student residences that are
vulnerable to intruders nor is the pro
blern oi unlocked doors restricted to
weekends. At least one hall president
reported that one of the doors to his hall
was oiten unlocked, usually on weekday
nights.

The responsibility ior locking hall
doors belongs to two separate groups.
The college employs a team oi night
watchmen who lock all campus
buildings, including residence halls, on
weeknights. 0n weekends, a security
patrol made of college students is in
charge of locking the halls.

The problem oi unlocked doors,
however, appears to he more in the
doors themselves man me people who
lock them. Both Loose and Younkers
are older, unrenovated halls. Conse
quently, the locking mechanisms on the
doors have fallen into disrepair and dc-
casmnally malfunction. A request was
made last semester {or Building and
Grounds to replace at least one of the
doors but as of yet no action has been
taken.

The higher incidence of unlocked
doors on weekends is presumably due
to the increased amount of use they

receive then, The aforementioned
security patrol is intended to prevent
this from happening. Made up of eight
Grinnell students, the security patrol is
divided into four pairs, two for each
side of campus

it is the responsibility oi each pair to
cover their side oi campus one or each
two weekend nights, locking hall doors
and admitting students who have
iorgotten their keys Members oi the
security patrol expressed confidence in
each other's ability, although several
admitted to dividing or staggering the
evening‘s shifts between themselves
and their partners in order to ease the
work load.

Susan Wittpenn, dean of Student Al~
iairs and over-seer oi the security

patrol, indicated a desire that students
accept more personal responsibility lor
their own security. "1 think the best
protection is students being careful and
other students being aware oi what’s
going on, she said.

Wittpenn advised calling the police
or contacting die dean on duty ii a stu-
dent came upon a situation that merited
intervention wittpenn said she relt it
was unlikely thatsuch a situation would
occur and expressed coniidence in the
security ol the campus as a Vihole, "I
personally ieel we're doing the best we
can,” she said, adding that the alter
native to the present system would be a
campuswide security lorce which she
felt was unnecessary.

F-grode discussion reopened

by Kim MacDonald

Possible reinstatement ol the
E‘rgrade was the topic oi discussion at
the Monday night meeting at the Cur-
riculum Council.

Chairman of die Committee and stu»
dent representative to the Curriculum
Council Jim Bowhay explained that
their task was to come up With a recom-
mendation on the present F/erase
system for the Curriculum Council.

The Curriculum Council is a body
comprised oi students irom the various
departmental Educational Policy Coun-
cils (EPC) who provide recommenda-
tions to me Curriculum Committee. On
the other hand. Curriculum Committee
is a iaculty hoard charged with
decisionrmaking powers.

After the Curriculum Committee
receives the proposal it will vote on
whether or not to reailirm the present
F/erase system or to reinstate the
Frgrade at Grinnell, Their decision
would go to the Committee on Acadmic
Standings, which might then approve it
and pass it on to the laculty tor a vote in
March.

Bowhay stressed the need tor the
EPC members to go out and talk to
students on campus to see how they iclt.
One student noted that this was
especially important slnce most of the
EPC members present were seniors
who would be unaliected by any change
in the grading system,

Discussion at the meeting ranged
irom suggestion on ways to change the
present system to a suggestion to

overhaul the whole system. There were
diitering opinions as to whether the
F-grade would help or hurt students.

Under the present system a student
who fans a course has no record of ever
taking the class No mention oi the
course or the grade appears on the stu~
dent grade report, transcript, the
school computer or any other of the stu7
dents records The system is occa»
Sionally abused by students who don't
want to get a c and choose not to take
the ﬁnal and, thus. usually tall the
course

The problems or the present system
range irom grade inﬂation to problems
with transcripts and graduate schools.
Bowhay felt, “There is something real-
ly wrong with a system where a D hurts
you more than a F in a strange way.‘

"Problems and skepticism in the way
graduate schools regard Grinnell
students" was another problem
brought up by a student at the meeting.
Some members tell it aliected the
school's credibility while others think
"it is ridiculous ii the integrity of the
school is based on a Gran:

This same issue was voted down two
years ago but several students noted
that there "were very strong iaculty
opinions" on the grading system this
year. The question which both students
and faculty will ultimately face is
whether a Grinnell transcript should
reflect what one has learned or what
one has not learned
