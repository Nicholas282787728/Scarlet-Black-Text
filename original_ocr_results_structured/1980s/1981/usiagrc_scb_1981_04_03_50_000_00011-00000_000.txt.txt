Bond highlights Martyrs' Weekend

by Lesley Williams

A major problem lor black
Americans has always been that of ac-
quainting their white fellow coun-
trymen with the obstacles which they
(ace in dealing with contemporary
American society. Grinnell’s Black
Martyrs' Weekend was tirst proposed
as an effort toward this goal. “Black
Martyrs' Weekend grew out of the idea
that there was a need to promote a
greater awareness of the black strug-
gle,” said Chris Johnson, a spokesman
for the Concerned Black Students
Organization which sponsors this event.

Still a major campus event after
more than to years, the 1981 Black Mar-
tyrs' Weekend offers a varied agenda of
activities centering on the theme “The
Political Status of Black Americans in
the '.tws' Among the offerings are two
brief lectures, a student- conducted wor-
ship service and a talk by black
stateman Julian Bond.

The weekend started off with last
night‘s lecture entitled "A Historical
Perspective on Black Politics." given
by Allreda Duster, a highly respected
lecturer on Negro history and the
daughter of anti-lynching crusader lda
B Wells. The lecture was followed by a

reception for Duster at which the
Young, Gifted and Black Gospel Choir
performed.

Tonight's major event is the Concern-
ed Black Students‘ presentation of
famous negro speeches at 7:30 pm. in
the Fine Arts building's Arena Theater
The program includes well known
discourses by such black leaders as
Marcus Garvey, Sojourner Truth,
Eldridge Cleaver and Martin Luther
King, Jr. Interspersed with the
speeches will be short dramatic
readings and poems including a poem
dedicated to black martyr Malcolmx,

Two different speakers present on
Saturday their views on what the future
holds for black Americans. At 2:30 pm.
Amanda Fouther-Austin, a Texas
psychologist, will speak on
“Psychological Options for the '305”
and discuss the psyche of contem-
porary black Americans and how it al-
tects them in the social and political do-
mains. (Note: Although previously
scheduled for South Lounge, the talk
will take place in Fine Arts 104, the first
iloor lecture room.)
