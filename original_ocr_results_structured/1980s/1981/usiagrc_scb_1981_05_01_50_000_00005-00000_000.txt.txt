Pinner brin

by Monique Vescia

This past week David Pinner, a
British actor, playwright, director and
lecturer in theater in the Grinnellsins
London program was on campus tor the
final Scholars' Convocation and theater
lectures.

In an interview with the 5&8 Pinner
displayed all the stereotypical
characteristics of the flamboyant, ec-
centric actor/playwright. As it he was
performing on a London stage, Pinner
described various scenes from his
career, how audiences inﬂuence his
work and the lact that critics are un-
necessary “vermin." He concluded
with prophecies about theater's future
and the difficulties of pursuing a
theater career.

5&3: What were your first experiences
with the theater’!

Pinner: I always wanted to be an actor
irom a very young age, from about the
age at eight, and when I was 1792 I went
to the Royal Academy 01' Dramatic Art
and trained there for two years and
then I lett and went to Perth Repertory
Company. My first job acting was with
Donald Sutherland in Inherit the Wind.
5&3: When did you begin to write
plays?

Pinner: 1 wrote my ﬁrst play when 1
was is and I’ve written a stage play
practically every year since then.
son: Has your acting helped you as a
playwright?

Pinner: 0h, tremendously, One has a
very good idea, when you’re an actor,
what's going to work on the stage, what
is dramatic, what is effective. what is
speakable. And it's a very honorable
tradition, William Shakespeare was an
actor, Harold Pinter, John Osborne,
when you write the play you're inside
the play; you‘re not just writing words,
you are writing words that you know ac-
tors can experience.

son: How much are you aware of an
audience when you write?

Pinner: I’m very aware of the au-
diencer Let me put it this way. I'm
aware of the effect upon the audience, I
feel that when I write I have a very
good idea of where the laughs in the
play are and where the audience will be
moved. But you can't really know until
you've got it in front of the audience.
It's irightening because suddenly you
can do nothing more — I hate opening
nights; they're dreadlul.

5&5: How do you leel about critics?
Pinner: i regard them as scum and
vermin, leeches. vampires; they
basically suck the blood of the theater,
they don’t contribute anything to it.
Generally, their opinions are er-
roneous, whether they praise you or
whether they damn you. When they
praise you, they praise you [or the
wrong things and may generally damn
you for the wrong things, And yet the
theater is entirely controlled by them. i
think they are on the whole a malignant
disease.

May 1, 1931

son: By which playwrights have you
been inﬂuenced?

Pinner: I have mainly been inﬂuenced
by Shakespeare and Chekhov,
Shakespeare is the greatest poeticepics
character dramatist and Chekhov is the
greatest at understanding the am-
bivalence, the tortuous ambiguity of
human character _ combined with an
immense sense of humor. All my plays
have got humor in them as well as a lot
of pain. I like to give the audience a lull
experience. The Potsdam Quartet [a
play written by Pinnerl 1s 1niluenced by
Chekhov and the other more epic plays
are inﬂuenced by Shakespeare. And I
think they have so much to teach
modern dramatists who often seem to
be too arrogant. I still lee] very humble
before those two gentlemen and they
continue to inﬂuence me.

5&3: What. directions do you see the
theater taking in the tuture'!

Pinner: It's very hard to make pro-
phecies when you‘re in the middle of it.
1 hope, and what rm trying to do in my
own work, is to get rid of the negative
element and try to write something
more positive. more liieenhancing, 1
think the theater has become too
cynical, too vicious, too sexually»
oriented in terms of perversion — and I
don't actually think it's what the au-
dienca want. It's a bit like the
gladiators being thrown betore the
Roman crowd: people are beginning to
try to ofter the audiences any kind of
spectacle of depravity-or violence as a
substitute {or thought or poetry.

SdrB: What would your advice be to
anyone interested in going into theater?
Pinner: Don’t. Unless you‘re complete-
ly insane and you know you‘re com-

gs London to Grinnell

pletely insane and you want to remain
completely insane. Then you should go
into die theater. You must be totally
obsessed — it‘s untortunately not -
enough to be good, it is not even enough '
to be very good; you’ve got to be I
something more than that to not only '
survive but to actually go somewhere. 1 - i
would not suggest that anyone go into .

number of other people also had 7
otherwise they 11 make their lite a total
misery.
