Thereiore there is much regret that
anybody should be hurt by any aspect oi
this party and much concern that the usual
Sp|rit or the James Gang Bang may be
altered

However, Archambault said he felt. “It
was the right decision to keep the name.
because ol the suspected silent mayority"
and because James Hall residents voted
overwhelmingly to keep the name.

Archambaull added that "the more peo-
ple that come and Interact, the better it
will be, We don't want to exciuce anybody,
it should be a great time! "

The Elephant Man is the iilm verston or
the recent Broadway play oi the same
name and has gained nearly universal ac-
claim as one at the tinest iilms produced

it is the true story at John Merrick, a
man so hideously delormed that the only
way or the open to him is to be gawked and
laughed at as a treakshow attraction. He is
"saved." however. by a sympathetic doc»
tor tilopkinsi who introduces him to the
world outside the carnival and attempts to
give him dignity and a sense oi himseli as

human in all ways. While he meets with
great success in uncovering the soul or an
Intelligent. artislic, kind man, his actions
are somewhat tainted as Merrick becomes
nearly as much an attraction in the upper
class tea circuit or Victorian London as lie

was at the carnival

The acting IS unitormly wonder-
tul. especially that by Hopkins and Hurt,
whose part. incidentally. was played on
the stage by David Bowie. Pay special at
tention to the way the movie was iilmed
and put together — it has been said that
this black and white cinematography is the
best done in Hollywood in the last ten
years.
