Rioting last spring and summer brought
Brixton, a section of London, to the
forefront of intemational news. After the
outbreak in Brixton, rioting spread
throughout England, shocking the country
into a closer look at its inner-city pro-
blems.

Students in one of Douglas Caulkins'
London anthropology classes recently in
terviewed Courtney Laws, head of the
Brlxton Neighborhood Community

_ Association (BNCA) , about the rioting and
Brixton’s social and economic problems.
After the interview, a receptionist from
the Community Center guided the group on

. a brief tour of the “frontline” section of
Brixton where the rioting occured,

I accompanied Caulkins' class to I
Mayall Road ior the meeting with Laws
where we met the community leader in the
Association's reception rocmr Walls of the
small ' room were covered with re-
development plans tor area housing. Laws
and his secretary took us to the building
next door, to his office and conference
room, Behind his chair, at one end of a long
table, was a large window through which
we could watch an active Brixtnn street
scene while Laws spoke.

Throughout the two hour interview a
small group oi men lounged on cars and
against buildings across the street. Young
boys skate-boarded through the group
while mothers guided their children into
the street to pass the men. later. several
men gathered on the outside steps to Law's
office, allowing their voices to be loud,
quieting only at the secretary's repeated
requiem

Laws began by explaining the purpose of
the Brixton Neighborhood Community
Association. He said the BNCA ”sets out to
develop and establish a community con
cept oi local involvement, grass-roots
thinking and aid and support ior powerless
and inarticulate people.” The BNCA is
now ten years old and Laws thinks it is ac-
cepted by both the local people and the
government,

The Association works for the local in-
habitants of Brixton but must also work
with the police and government
authorities. Every such organization in the
Lambeth area iBrlxton falls under
Lambeth political jurisdiction) must have
some member of the local authority on
their administrative board. Laws told us
that “through tact and very good
thinking" the Association has been able to
keep command of its administrative
development as an organization, However,
he added, the local authority decides who
will receive grants from the government,
so “If you’re not supportive oi the local
authority you're more than unlikely to get
the grant.”

Laws thinks the people in Brixton are
caught in a political arena. The authority
there is Socialist and does not yet get along
with the conservative Thatcher Govern-
ment. According to laws, policies oi the
government are not adhered to by the local
authority and this results in a “galvinized
jungle" on the strees.

Grinnell students tour riot-torn Brixton

ton's history leading to the riots He
described the conditions in terms of police
relations with the community, in the
earlier days, policemen walked their beats
singly. They used no cars, sirens or radios.
The policemen were weIHmown to the peo
ple and were helpful. Laws said there was
cooperation between the local authorities
and the police.

Then police divisions began to change
irequently and policemen rarely held a
beat ior more than a year. They paired up
and began to use cars and sirens. Alter
that, said Laws, when a policeman radioed
for a car, he did not get one car, but six or
seven, all with sirens screaming “This ex-
cites a community that is already sufferr
ing serious handicaps and serious enr
vironmental problems," he said. Police
have not changed their strategy since the
riots, he added, but are now using even
more sophisticated equipment. Another
problem Laws pointed out is that there are
no senior officers on beats able to guide
new officers.

Of the riots, Laws said, “The lid had to
blow oti because people had enough. . . it's
good that it happened." Although the
police have not altered their technical
sophistication, Laws told us, ”1 don't supr
pose you'll flnd any incident of harassment
Since the riot . . . things have been very
quiet , . 1 think the police have been
authorized to take a very low profile."

Other conditions contributed to the ten
sion irom which the riots sprang, however.
These conditions include unemployment,
poor educational iacilities, a high crime
rate and homelessness. There are not

not. He blames much or the problem on the
teachers, describing them as ”apalling.”
otten parents cannot read so they rely on
the schools to educate their children and,
said Laws, they are “badly let down." He
suggmts parents send their children to
private schools. ‘

Crime among youth has risen in the past
few years and so has the percentage oi
squatters. Laws does not think squatters
are altogether bad. In his opinion, the
housing provided for lowerincome people
in the area is terrible. One of the housing
complexes is a huge brick building with
tiny windows which looks like a prison or
civic center arena. He predicted that
wiuiin a iew years oi living there people
would be jumping irom thetop olthc struc»
ture,

Laws also does not give iull approval oi
the designs ior new housing which are
displayed in the front office of the Com-
munity Center. He objects that the com
munity was not consulted on the plans and
thinks the projected location is bad. The
site is across the street irom undeveloped
slums.

Laws stressed that the riots were not
racial but directed only against the police;
“Black and white iought together through
struggle." He said people of diilerent
races have been living “side by side" in
Brixton ior 20 or so years and have never
had any racial conflict, ”as yet."

The BNCA leader pointed out that only
the bad happenings in Brixton were
reported. A “peace party" held to
celebrate the Royal Wedding last summer
went off without a problem. ”We had a

Liverpool after their rioting. The true riot
started in Brixton. it was a spontaneous
thing because oi the pressures and the pro»
blems that confront us. But that rioting has
not brought any iinancial rewards or
benefits to the communityimmediately, as
has happened in Liverpool."

“However," Laws continued, ”it is my
opinion that Brixton will be a better place
in terms of resources." Because the House
of Commons has recommended to the
Government that Brixton is an area of
urgency, he ioresees "a number oi light in-
dustries . a number oi separate
organizations well-iunded by local
authorities . . , better policing . . . [at
liason between the community and the
police , . . on a statutory level . , and train»
ing programs among unemployed people."
Laws also looks forward to “leadership
irom the young people."

Since the riots, anthropologists, social,
scientists, sociologists and more have
studied Brixton and, according to Laws,
have round no answer to the problem. He
feels, “The answer for Brixton rests on the
streem, with organizations like ours,"

After our talk with Laws the receptionist
took us on a brief tour of Mayall and
Ramon roads where the rioting occured.
She showed us where the post office and
various businesses were located previous
to the lighting Now there are only
boardedrup, blackened brick buildings,
Many structures are merely a tumbling
facade. The ravaged area comprises only
a few blocks, however, and well kept
homes, with flower boxes in bloom, are in»
terspersed with the bombed buildings

 

 

 

 

enough jobs in the area and even more
businesses have moved out oi Brixton
since the riots. Laws ieels light industry
should be brought into the area to ease
unemployment.

According to the leader, “Teachers in
this country . , don’t take education
seriously , . . education should be in the
hands oi the parents with support irom the
teachers, with support irom the communi-
ty at large.” Children go through the
school system, said Laws, and come out it
literate or semi-literate.

The truancy rate tor the last three years
has been very high and, laws told us, the
teachers do not care it the kids are there or

peace party alter the rioting with 13,000
people, with two police and there was
never one incident,” Laws told us, “Not a
single incident irom 12 in the day 'til i2 at
night , , We had a very good evening,"
The party was not covered by the media,
apart irom a small bit on television,
because, said Laws, “it was yust too good
to be newsworthy," since then, smaller
groups have had social gatherings also
with no problems,

Brixton needs money to make im»
provements and Laws thinks it is “very
sad that money has not been injected into
Brixton. it has been injected into Liver-
pool, 10 million pounds have been put into

We walked past clumps oi unemployed
men leaning against store lronts at street
corners Our guide pointed out the
playground surrounded by a high chain-
linked fence, which is now run by the
BNCA and was only a hill oi dirt, Yet,
when the BNCA had control oi it, parents
sent their children to play there. Now iew
children are allowed to attend the play ses»
sions. We saw the playgound at a time
when it was scheduled to be open, but it
was locked with no one around

At the end or the alternoon, we could see
ior ourselves the problems Brixtnn is iac-
ing and the reasons tor the riots which
have spread throughout England
