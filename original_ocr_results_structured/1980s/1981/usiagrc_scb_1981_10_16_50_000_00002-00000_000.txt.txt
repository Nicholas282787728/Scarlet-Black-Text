Mediterranean Project set for Nov. 3-5
Perri, Gibson get grant to discuss democracy

by Marty Merlotta

Sir Winston Churchill once called the
area ”the soft underbelly of Europe."
Friedrich Engels deicribed it as “the lin-
chpin of the revolution.” The areas both
men were talking about were the often
unstable nations of the Northern Mediter-
ranean. Nov, 3, 4 and 5 Grinnell College,
along with the Iowa Humanities Board, the
National Endowment for the Humanities
and the Rosenfield Program in Public Af-
fairs, International Relations and Human
Rights will open a symposium at Grinnell
on the future of democracy in this tradie
tionally turbulent part of the world.

The symposium, entitled “The Mediter-
ranean Project," was organized by Pro-
fessors Dennis Perri of the Spanish depart-
ment and Mary Gibson ot the history
department. Both protessors are
Grinnell‘s own specialists in northern
Mediterranean affairs; Perri for Spain
and Gibson for Italy, They both wanted to
inform Iowans about the problems that
these nations face in transforming their

society from semi—feudal models into
democratic pluralistic societies.

The Mediterranean Project will look at
both the history and future of the
democratic process in five Northern
Mediterranean countries: Portugal,
Spain, italy, Greece and Turkey. Schedule
ed events include lectures and panel
discussions by some of the top secialists on
the top of these countries' affairs. Lec-
turers include Richard Gunther, professor
of political science at Ohio State Universis
ty; John Cammett, professor or history at
the John Jay College oi Criminal Justice;
Stanley Payne, professor of history at the
University of Wisconsin and Leonardo
Paggi of the University of Modena, a
member of the Italian Communist Party.

Gibson said. “Since many of these na-
tions are tied politically and economically
to the United States and Western Europe,
it is important for Americans to unders-
tand how these nations operate.” She also

noted that the symposium will look into
various themes, ”such as terrorism, the
Common Market, the Roman Catholic
Church and NATO, themes which cut
across the Mediterranean cultures and are
either supportive or detrimental to the
growth of democracy."

Perri said, noting the recent distur-
bances in Spain, (where the government
was almost overthrown) and Turkey
(where the civilian government was
deposed by the military), “The
democracies seem to be in trouble and it
seems an opportune time to study the pro
blem."

All of the panel discussions and most of
the lectures will be held in South lounge.
The discussion, ”Political Realities and
Prospects for Democracy in Greece and
Turkey," will be held Nov. 3 at 4:15 p.m.
with Professor Wayne Moyer as
moderator. NOV. 4, at the same time, a
discussion entitled “American Foreign

Policy and the Mediterranean" will be
held. It will be moderated by Grinnell
Junior High School Vice-Principal Ted
Mueller. Lectures will be conducted
throughout the symposium by the scholars
listed above and will be capped oil by the
Scholars' Convocation in Herrick Chapel
Nov. 5 at 11 a m, Payne will give a lecture
on the “Perilous Democratization in Spain
and Portugal."

Besides the Grinnell College communi-
ty, the faculties of both the University of
Iowa and iowa state University as well as
the faculties of several smaller Iowa cola
leges are attending, Professor Joseph
Wall, head of the Rosenfield Program, has
also extended invitations to prominent
Iowa government officials including
Governor Robert Ray, Secretary oi State
Mary Jane Odell, US. Senators Roger
Jepsen and Charles Grassley, Us. Con-
gressman Jim Leach and State Represen-
tative Janet Carl.

IFC members and guidelines decided

Organizations may receive up to $200 for activities

by Laura McDermith

The initiative Fund Committee (IFC)
was established to provide iunds for
special activities. Almost any activity can
qualify ior iunding as long as it beneiits
more than 20 people and as long as the ac-
tivity is not also funded by the Political Ac-
tivilies Support mind or Finance Commit-
tee.

in order ior a request to be considered
ior iunding, an official er application
must be filled out. These applications are
available irnm Marilyn Zielinski,
chairperson oi the lrc, The request must
include an itemized budget and must be
submitted prior to the event.

The [PC is most interested In ideas that

show imagination and original thought.
Some examples or original events iunded
in the past by the WC are the Come as You
Sleep Party held in Younkers Hall last fall
and the Luau, complete with a roasted pig,
which James Hall sponsored last spring.
Other groups that have received funding
irnm me IFC are the Concerned Black
Students ior the Black Cultural Weekend
and the Associated Jewish Students ior the

'Jewish Cultural Weekend

Some groups that apply to the er l'or
iunds have enough money in their own
budget to cover an event, but ii the event ls
open to the whole campus, groups can still
receive iunding. In this way campuswide

events can be held and there will still be
money for activities within the group The
IFC also allocates money ior smaller ac
tivities, as long as 20 or more people will be
beneritted

The budget for the er is $4,000 a year,
Because budget requests differ from week
to week, it is oiten diiiicult to budget the
money. It is possible, according to Zielin-
ski, that ii the we were to run out of iunds.
the SGA would increase the committee's
budget, The maximum amount granted to
any organization is $200

Because of the late elections last year,
this year's IFC was late in forming. To till
the gap, last year's IFC continued under

Chairman Mark Salmanson and in late
September, zielinski was chosen as
chairperson. The other members are Pam
Hankin, Bob Dorsett, Laura Ohline, Than-
di Bergfalk and Joey Walsh.

The IFC meew every Thursday evening
and reviews an average or tour requests
each week Often, the committee will give
advice to an organization about savmg
money. Instead of having pamphlets
printed in town, ior example, the IFC
might recommend using campus iacilities
at a lower cost

Any request rejected by the lFC can be
appealed at the Joint Board meetings held
every Wednesday.

SGA offers $30 party prize for most blood

Blood drive to be held in North Lounge

by Melissa Kagle

It isn't often that a Grinnell College stu-
dent, faculty member or staff member has
the chance to be a lifesaver. However, on
Oct. 28, 29 and 30 the Community Blood
Bank of Central Iowa will come to North
Lounge, giving members oi the Grinnell
community a chance to donate hiesaving
blood.

There are many excuses given by potene
tial donors for not giving blood. Most oi
these do not hold water. Contrary to
popular belief, blood donation is a prac»
tically painless process that does not take
much time. The whole process Lakes one-
half hour with the actual bloodletting tak-
ing only five to seven minutes on the
average. In fact, the only valid excuses for
not donating are: being 15s than 17 years
old, weighing less than 110 pounds or hav-
ing recently contracted a list of various
diseases,

An added incentive to donate is a $30 par-
ty prize irom the SGA, which is sponsoring
the drive, to die dorm or house that has the

largest percentage of residents donating.

Amy Welch, SGA Student Coordinator, is
enthusiastic about the blood drive and ex
peels or have about 330 students volunteers
ing to donate. “It’s one of the iew projects
that lets students contribute to the entire
state of Iowa rather than just the
campus," she commented,

There are two ways to sign up be give
blood, One way is to fill out the bottom por-
tion of the ﬂyer that was distributed to all
students and return it to the SGA box in the
post office. The other is to call the SGA Oir
fices directly and sign up ior a time. There
is room ior six preregislered people and
two Walkeins every fifteen minutes

People who are not up to giving blood
themselves are encouraged to volunteer to
help those who are. Workers are needed in
the canteen, at the registration table and
in the actual donor room. Students should
call the SGA offices to sign up for one of
these important jobs.

Jenkins stresses Drake’s
role in fund-raising

514.4 million. The Board of Trustees, which
makes the iinal decisions concerning the
use oi the endowment, would be able to
spend the principal ii it became necessary.

Jenkins said. ”If the inﬂation rate con- ‘

tinues to increase, the value oi the prin»
cipal,” which he termed ‘quasi»
endowments' “would decrease."

“it would be awtully nice if at the begin-
ning of the year someone gave you a list
and said here are the priorities for raising
money this year," Jenkins said. This does
not occur. instead, the trustees set
priorities for the use of the endowment and
the Development Office then solicits
money to meet them. Jenkins noted that
the library and dormitory renovations are

It’s that time at year again. The annual
blood drive will invade the Grinnell Col;
lege campus the week after break. Seen

the top priorities at the present time.
Another important iactor is the role
played by Prsident George Drake in raise
ing money ior the college. “Although
Drake did not have much experience in
fund-raising,” Jenkins reported, “he has
increasingly become involved in be pro-
cess,” Drake is determined to acquaint
businesses with the college. The president
is also increasing his association with
alumni across the nation. Drake’s trip to
Hawaii this week will include meeting with
a large alumni group “which has a very
great potential in giving," said Jenkins.
