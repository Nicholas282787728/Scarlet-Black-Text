Uniting Behind Reagan

The sloth preSIdent of the United
States look otlice last week He was not
the first choice 0| most 0! us or even the
second choice But now he is the preslr
dent and deserves all the respect and
support no can give him as he begins
his administration.

President Reagan has two major con-
cerns as he begins his term in office:
the economy and loreign policy.

The pl‘eSIdent has a 12 percent annual
lnl’lkltlon rate to Cut. It Is no doubt true
that the increases in crude oil prices
have had an enormous impact upon the
rate of Inflation but the definition of in-
tlation still remains to be too many
dollars chasmg too few goods, The
lederal government has pursued an
economic policy that was ellective in
the 1930‘s. Today, Keynesian ap-
proaches to solving our economic mess
life not going to vlork in tact, the at»
tempts made have failed. We have
lound that it is impossible to stimulate
the demand hall of the economic equa-
tion and keep a lid on inllation.

ln the nation today there are two col»
lectlolis of economists who are gaining

power and prestige. The lirst. the
monetarists, propose tighter restricr
tions on the amount of dollars that are
floating around in the economy thereby
reducing those too many dollars chas-
ing too low goods. The second, smaller
group, is dedicated to the supply-side
economics of Arthur Latter. They pro
pose that the government enact policies
to stimulate business production
thereby increasing uie too few goods
that are being chased by too many
dollars As-the economy worsens, the
opposition to these different ap
proaches to solve the economic pros
blem is disappearing, More and more
people are realizing that the New Deal
economics that saved us from the Great
Depression are not sound policies lor
the 1980's,

0n the foreign policy lront, President
Reagan is faced with the problem of re»
establishing America's credibility in
the world community. The embarrass-
ment and humiliation of the hostage
crisis is linally over. it is now up to the
president to tormulate policy that will
discourage any luture terrorist

however, that ale was to most people's
liking. Moreover, the sagging alcohol
industry has recovered due to un-
precendented American support.

In light of recent nationalistic aims in
Scotland and Wales, we propose that in
exchange [or Ronald Reagan's Pacific
Palisades home in the United States
may acquire them as your 51st and 52nd
states. respectively

One tmal interesting highlight: Mr,
David Plnner has been appointed to the
Arts Council of Great Britain. His new
play, "The Grinnelllans in Britain"
opens in March starring Howard Bren»
ton as Harold Lee, Everyone from Grin-
nell has opening night tickets.

Due to the realization that Parliar
ment has been supreme tor tar too long,
I, Margaret Thatcher, have decided to
take over the entire governing process
and Show the world that old traditional
countries do not die . . they merely

rorist groups know that the United -.

It is now time to get on with the

Solved only if Hie public is willing to
support the efforts of the president, .
Some say the presidency is too much. -,
for one man. It isn't. Not if certain ins
terests are willing to forego some of
their own selfish goals for the benefit of .t
the nation as a whole. We must all unite
in support of the new president if he is
to have any chance at all in solving this
nation’s problems Those who wish to,
manitest their immaturity by wearing
silly black armbands are not needed as
we get together to put the country back
on track, Let us put aside political di
ferences and get to work.
