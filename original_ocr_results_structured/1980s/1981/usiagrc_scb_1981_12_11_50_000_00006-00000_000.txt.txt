Spinster Catalyst

Soon you shall help clutter my rooms
With teacups and cats and a quill —
' l‘|| with your help toss out my perfumes
The only scent becoming that of my guilt.
l’II tie my hair in a knot an my head
I'll marry my ideas, my books,
Alone, with white sheets on a single bed
The darkness, the silence won't consider my looks.

Plastic Man

Steal from me.

Take from me.

oh _ go on now _ You know you
Never wanted to do anything else.
You're a man aren‘t you? ’
Really, I understand,

I mean, that's what all men do,
Now isn't it?

My God

How utterly weak

You must appear when you

See yourself in a woman's eye.
You really are afraid of me —
Now aren't you MAN?

Hey, here's a penny —

Go buy yoursell a plastic

Woman man.

Peel her out or your pertect mold.
Oh — go ahead — I hate the sight
Of a grown man deprived

or it's play things.

Hey. catch,

Here's-a book of matches.

Once she doesn't fit your mold anymore.
Just melt her down and force her
Into a new one.

what?

Ohl She's empty inside?

Well. she would have

Been empty when you

Were through with her

Even If she were real.

Now wouldn't she MAN?

Did you my something MAN?
Excuse'me, but you're going to
Have to lift up your head and
Stop mumbling

It you want me to hear.

Oh! Now I hear ya —

You're tired or playing.

Hey watch it man.

You're holding a burning matth!
Look —- You're melting —

But I thought only plastic could rneln

Working Boys

All the hard muscled working boys,
They never kiss my hand,

They never respect my mind.

If I could give them my body like toys,
l rnean, life would be grond.

What do I care, I‘m sleazy, I’m blind.
They lead me on with their crafty pioyt.
They say “We’ll too the promired land"
“C‘mon baby, I need to unwind!”

The working (my; and their working class joys
Escape me as l m on a tilver strand
oftond, at the gentle yeort turn kind.

but I didn’t begin
and I didn't pursue

he is the one
who wants
to have his cake

Repl'es

"I want to be free," it said,
So I let it go;
It left — never retumsd.

Now I'm the prisoner —
Caged within a memory;
Prisoner to a lost Dream.

"I wam to be free," I said . . .
No Reply . . .

PROGRESSION

|

At sunset

Watercolors wash the evening sky,
And the purples and pinks

Spotter to the ground

Tinting the flowers of tomorrow
Which are now fading into black.

||

At midnight

The colors aren’t real ~—

Reflected in the glare of Streetlights
Or barely seen under moon and stars,-
There is a grayness of hue

That comes with black night.

lll

At down

The bubble of black bursts softly

As the colors come alive,

The stars vanish in a flood of blue

Which follows an orange glow,

And the sun appears to paint another day.

she is justified
’though she doesn‘t know it
and I can see her side
