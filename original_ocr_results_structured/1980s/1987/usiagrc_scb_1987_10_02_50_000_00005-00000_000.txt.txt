Hansen puts it. ”I think you can
tell the dillerence lrom mixes,"
Apparently, a lot oi people agree
with him. He reported that ”a lot ot
kids eat the Texas cinnamon rolls
without the icing. and some even
like the hamburger buns plain."
Hansen works hard to produce
such delectable results. He rises
around midnight and rides his
bicycle to the bakery He generally
doesn't go home until about who

at about 4:30 PM. to take care or
other business: “i make what i
call my orders, la list] or what l'll
need the next day." Hansen spends
about 12 hours a day in the bakery.

alarms to ensure that he awakens

business. Ha'iscrv replied, "This is
