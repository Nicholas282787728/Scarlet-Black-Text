Wednesday nights open discus-
sion oi Tuaday's Speakeasy was
organized. according to Simon
Levin, because he Ielt it “31)»
propriate as a continuance ol the
Speakeasy," Moderator Steve
Pickle said in his opening com~
ments that the open iorum was
”organized in order to help re
mote discussion, and to iur her
eradicate an atmosphere oi ig-
norance here at Grinnell, We hope
that people who come here tonight
will share their values ,not inﬂict
them." Over 30 peop e. students
and nonsstudents alike, shared
their opinions with the large crowd

adjust. But they should give you a
chance to try to get to know them.

Nate Golden: I learned from the
Speakeasy that I am black, Prior
to this year, and prior to this whole
thing, I've never thought or myseli
as being black. 1 was raised around
whites my entire trio 1 have
always had the same fears that a
lot oi you have when you see
blacks. I was always afraid to go
into the same ghetto areas that you
were airaid oi. i was always airaid
that those people were going to
hurt me,

Lisa Dorsey: When we spoke
yesterday. we didn't want you to
rationalize about it, Fine. You ieel
guilty", Do something about it.

I'm hearing a lot of the white
students say. “Well this is the
reason why." Forget the damn
reasons why. The reasons existed
in the past.

We did not get on the panel
yesterday for people to come and
say. "Oh, well, this is the reason
that it's happened... " What are we
going to do now? That's the point at
hand, What are we going to do
now?

Samantha Massiiigale: i learned,
myseli, that i expect to tight ior
things that white students don‘t
have to expect to light for, when I
really shouldn't have to be ex-
pected to light ior something that
other students enjoy, like having

iaculty role models.

the Hatlestad; There shouldn't
have to be any more speakeasys or
open iorums about racism. Now
what has to be done is we have to
take action,

People who change things in
society are white people. The black
students banding together to get
more black iaculty probably isn‘t
going to be enough, They're going
to have to have support irom the

are much larger. have been
moditied and that's a very big
plus. Another area is in terms oi
the kind oi relationship that
teachers and students have with
one another. That seems very
much a tactor in what the learning
experience has been. And yet. as
you look at things that Grinnell is
into. you can see that along with
the Grinnellain-London program
there are a number oi other
iellowships and internships which

what attracted you to Grinnell
as a student?

Ronald Gault

There were three speciiic things
I went to high school in Chicago,
and I had a wonderful placement
teacher who when it was time for
me to start searching around for
colleges asked me where did I
think I wanted to go I had three
criteria which were essentially:
it A school that had a very strong
academic and scholastic reputa-
tion: 2) A college that looked like a
college. i wanted to be in an ens
vironment with greenery, places
where you go oil to read and study
and contemplate and discuss. And
iinally i wanted it to be iar enough
away irom Chicago that i would
not be home every other night or
day or every weekend. I had one
lriend in particular in Chicago who
was not going away. who was going
to go to college in the general area.

And i was wise enough at that

would want to matriculate So, for

those three reasons I picked Grins

There has been much talk on
campus recently about racism at
Grinnell. when you were a student,
did you experience any instances
or what you saw as racism?

The language is very important.
is we choose language to describe
situations. Idon't think I would use
the language that you Just chose to
describe what may be an area that
needs work at Grinnell. 1 think the
college, as most institutions of
higher learning. should aspire to
want to have its iaculty and ad-
ministrative staff reflect the
larger society in which its
graduates will live and work To
the extent that there needs to be
greater diversity on those stalls. I
think it's a very appropriate agenr
da item of those who are in leader
ship positions to pursue,

have an eiiect on you, that there
was a lack oi black iaculty

Ronald Gault
Not that I was aware oi, Maybe
on a subliminal level but its hard
ior me to say at this point.
Nonetheless. I know as someone
who has served on the board oi a
number oi institutions, the most
pertinent oi which is the city
University oi New York at which
there was at the time about 200,000
students, that part oi a learning ex-
perience should be an interaction
between students and iaculty. To
the extent that there are blacks on
the iaculty, that's a plus ior not our
ly black students but white
students as well. it enables those
students who have never had the
experience oi a discussion or an en-
counter with someone oi a diir
ierent race or ethnic persuasion to
do so. That's the very essence oi

On Tuesday, the voters oi Grin-

over l-lenry Snead and James Cox,
In his next term. Anderson has

issues and projecLs he has worked

another oi his concerns. A par-
ticular area where Anderson sees
development as a possibility is
south or town, near the junction oi
Highway 146 and Interstate 80
When Anderson lirst came to
Grillnell in 1953, the college was
not as iinancially secure as it now
is. In fact, at one point Anderson,
who then owned Grlniiell Office
Supply, had to go to great lengths
to get the college to pay a $500 bill
that they had run up. "Since then
the college has made financial
gains like i can't believe.‘ he said.
Although town-college relations
have not always been the best.
