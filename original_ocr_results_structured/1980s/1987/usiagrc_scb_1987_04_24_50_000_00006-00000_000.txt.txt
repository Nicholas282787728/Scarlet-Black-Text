with the ﬁnancial support of the ad-

that Nollett House can indeed act iii the

and the college overall.

Last. night several of us, members of a
close group of friends of which Doug
Susens was a vital part, met in a private
dining room in the Forum to talk about our
memories of Doug, We told each other
stories we already knew, reminded each
other ci moments we had iorguttcri. And
we laughed. Last night, in remembering
Doug, the prevailing mood was one at
mirth. Because. quite simply. Doug was a
iun guy, I want to say that he worked hard
at being Iun, but that's not true; ll. was
natural, it you knew his smile, you know
what we mean, It was never forced or
strained; it was just there. Certainly that
gives testament to Doug’s strength. Doug
was one of the strongest and bravest in-
dividuals any of us has ever known. At
times oi extreme adversity, Doug would
smile and tell us not to worry. Hi5 concern
was [or us at those time, not for himself.
We found that it was impossible to talk of
Doug without talking about his car. named
after its license plate: the BUTNESS.
BOTNESS was a truly amazing vehicle. A
huge, blue road yacht out at the ’605,
Doug’s grandmother’s Iowa farm car, the
BOTNESS always worked, Even when its
engine tell out. Even though in the winter-

time it was necessary to spray ether into
the Carburetor to Start it (a measure which
bought Karin Nyhus some singed hair),
the BO’I‘NESS always ran. We remember
Doug on trips to Newton, [or Chinese load
and Baskln-RubbinS, or just for
McDonald's and an hour out of Grinnell:
his sunglasses on, his tape player blasting,
one arm casually poked out the window
and the other draped cooly over the wheel.
We reflected last night that the BOTNESS
was, in many ways, very much like its
driver,

During his senior year, Doug was alien
in and out of the hospital. We remembered
last night one evening a dozen or so at us
had gone down to the hospital to visit. We
all got lab coats an and paper»clipped our
student. IDs to the pockets so we'd look like
doctors, and went up to his room. There
were far too many of us to fit in there, so
we decided we'd just havé L0 go elsewhere.
After a short Search we found a nice, plush
conierence room, and we appropriated it.
And we broke out the poprtaris, the chips,
the pup and styroloam cups, and some
yogurt that Doug had asked for, and we
had a party Actually, we got somewhat
loud and raucous. and the whole thing and
ed when an evil-looking nurse stepped in,
pointed her linger and said one word:
”Out!”

We remembered Doug’s competence
last night. Doug was excellent at comr
puting and a line and willing tutor. Must oi
us, myself included, benefited from his 6X7
pert help. I personally remember the sum-
mer beiore Doug’s senior year when he

Deep breath. The log hisscs-iram my lips

From the edge of the embankment
overlooking the road. I can see either

autumn breezes, spiral down luzily irom
their irazeii heights and shutter on the
lial‘dzpacked earlh, I fell the Cold steel
glrded to my side, like an extension oi my
body. And we wait.

Time passes, but the sun, hidden beyond

continues to blow,

are gone, replaced by momentary ireeiall.

Warm blood coats his shoulder and lower sleeve.

 

First the hoolbeals sound, then a distant

rasps tree and turns in my gloved grip,
cutting edge to the wmti, i hold ready, mo-
lionless. a Still boulder cloaked from an un-
disccrning, hurried eye, preparing to roll
and bound down the rough embankment to
[he road below,

Only when I can see the evaporating
pulls oi moisl mlsl irom the horse's
labored nostrils do I swoop. T0 the rider I
must look like a bat. with my wings spread
wide. I embrace his body. 0ur eyes meet
on impact. Mine are blue crystal. ﬁts are

out to find a suitable place ior camp.

The dawn is crisp. the sky still gray.
After a breakiast oi cold jerky, I wander
towards the stream nearby and stand tit

tow beckons. 1 brush away the trozen
streaks oi salty tears my my lace. wiping
away the boy and all at the others. The tan

my ringers and sinks in the smooth runn-

around me. Ice clings to their wrinkled
trunks I run north against the winter
wind.

and I were doing research tar Mr, Wubr
bels Doug knew every instrument in the
lab cold and I knew zilch, Doug took a
great deal oi time teaching me the things I
needed to know irom scratch Doug also
had a great way 01 making you ieel ap~
predated. You‘d be on your way
downtown, say, and you’d ask iihe wanted
you to pick up something {or him and he
would smile and say.“1’dlikethat.”And
you knew that he really would, Karin
Nyhus said last night. “He was always my
biggest supporter, my biggest ian club. He
made everything I did seem so wondertul.
even it I didn‘t always think so myself."
Doug did that tor many oi us.

But it Doug was strong and supportive,
he was also supported. We remembered
last night the strength he relied on his
sister Karl and on Scott Mathews for. and
we remembered his happiness when he
learned that they would be coming to Grin
nell. As his iriends, we have always
recognized and appreciated greatly the
role these two special people played in
Doug‘s hie.

Those, brieily, were the thoughts we
shared with each other last night in
preparation icr these remarks. I speak on
behali or a sizable group oi people who
knew and loved Doug at Grinnell. To each
oi us individually and to all‘m'us collective
ly, Doug meant many things, but i hope
they would agree with me upon the aptncss

was a man Take him [or all in all,/l shall
not look upon his like again."
