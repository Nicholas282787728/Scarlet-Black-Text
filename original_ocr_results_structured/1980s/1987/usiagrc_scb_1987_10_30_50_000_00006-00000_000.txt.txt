XTC is FUN

by Thomas Beverly and Eric
, Johnson

Once again, XTC has stepped out
oi their tamiliar progressive niche
to become the Dukes oi
Stratosphere and are having iun
with the psychedelic sounds oi the
605, Their new album, “Psonic
Psunspot," is their iirst LP, a
iollow-up to the recent EP “25
O’Clock.” The Dukes manage to
parody every aspect oi the
psychedelic era in everything trom
the abstract cover illustration to
the gibberish tillers between songs
to the songs themselves.

An initial playing oi this album
evokes numerous comparisons to
hands irom the ties. and subse-
quent listening reveals heavy in-
iluence from Love, the Kinks, and
most obviously the Beatles. “Pale
and Precious,” which closes the
album, even adds the sound oi the
Beach Boys. XTC's most recent
album, ”Skylarking." owed much
oi is structure to the Beatles, and
the Dukes carry that inﬂuence
over into their album. “Brainiac's
Daughter” sounds like an out-take
irom the White Album, and
“You’re a Good Man Albert
Brown"and Kaleidoscope" have
similar parallels to other Beatles’
works. “Psonic Psunspot,”
however, is no standard parody.

The songwriting is strong and
consistent, and great care is taken

Bookmark

to duplicate both the atmosphere
and production oi the psychedelic
albums oi the dos. Most oi all, the
album is a lot oi good fun

TOM:

Based solely on how much FUN
the album is to listen to, 1 award it
an A, The music breaks no new
ground but never attempts to. it is
simply an enjoyable trip back
through time and sets no par»
ticuiar goals ior itseli. ”Vanishing
Girl” is probably the best song, but
”Brainiac’s Daughter” also stands
out. There are no bad tracks. in
tact, the only drawback to ”Psonic
Psunspot” is its brevity. i only
wish it had gone on longer.

ERIC:

1 had mixed ieelings about
“Psonic Psunspots,” so i gave it a
c. It is iun, and trying to iigure out
why all the songs sound so iamiliar
is great. But once i had done that. i
really ielt no urge to hear more.

It’s cute, but who cares? Thev

mimicry is only suriace-level.
Fsychedelia needs an album
length to work, and this is deiinite-
ly an album ofsingles. Listen to it a
couple of times, then go back to the
real thing “The Aiiiliated" is the
perfect Love parody, No song on
the album is bad enough to note.

Crossing to Safety

by Todd Francis

“Crossing to Safety," by Wallace
Stegner, is a tale of exodus, transi-
tion, and colonization. The exodus
is from the stately, civilized lands
of colleges in the Eastern United
States; the destination is Madison,
Wisconsin, desolate city of the
West, The story takes place during
the Depression, a time oi want in
almost all parts of the nation. But
Sid and Charity Lang, residents of
Madison, have survived neverr
thelﬁs m and survived welli So
well that Larry and Sally Morgan
are stunned at the richness of the
house to which their hosE invite
them during their ﬁrst night in
town.

Since the storyline is set in the
19305. the two himbands work and
the two wives keep house. Lang is a
prolessor of English who dreams
oi being a poet but does not write
because he tears lack ot accepr
tance. Morgan arrives as a bud
ding new professor and im-
mediately puts out an array of
material that gets him the label of

a “hack" but nonetheless insures
him oi a tenured job at the univer-
sity.

The work centers around the
development or the relationship
between the two couples and
around the children that are soon
to be born to both Charity and Sal-
ly. In an atmosphere oi education
that is both intellectual and warm,
the foursome talk deep into the
evenings and wander the fields of
the countryside during the day. In
the words oi the Langs, they are
establishing a new center of
blossoming wisdom in the
Midwest, full of growth and in
spiration long gone irom the per
manence of the East.

Wallace stegner paints a picture
of the progressively intertwining
lives oi his characters as they grow
with one another and in their
careers, “Crossing to Safety” is
his tenth book, and among his
previous publications are “The
Sound of Mountain Water,” a book
oi traveling essays.

Rosemary’s Baby

by Bruce Emond

Roman Polanski’s “Rosemary's
Baby," adapted lrom Ira Levin's
novel of the Same title, is an ex-
traordinarily chilling, suspenseful,
and involving horror iilm, a class
above the blood-andrgore horror
[licks to which we are now ac-
customed, Set in 1963 (Polanski
uses the Pope's Vistt t0 the US. and
Increasingly short skirts of the
female characters to identity the
time period), “Rosemary's Baby”
tells of Rosemary (Mia Farrow)
and her husband, an aspiring actor
played by John Cassavetes, who
move into a luxury apartment
building on Manhattan's ritzy Up-
per East Side, There they meet a
motley group of neighbors, in par
ticular an elderly couple who go
out of their way to help them ads

Bride

by Brian strause

“Bride oi Frankenstein” is a se-
quel to the 1932 horror iilm
“Frankenstein." Yes, even back in
the 19305 Hollywood had the tinan—
cial vision to bank on past suc-
cesses. However, what sets this
iilm apart from the current horror
parade oi sparkling cinematic
gems such as the “Friday the
13th“ and the “Omen" sagas is
that it intelligently mocks what in
1935 was a young, embryonic
genre.

The original “Frankenstein"
ends with Baron Frankenstein's

iorging his acting career, ignores
her complaints. The degree oi his
ambition and the reasons {or his
dismissing attitude become shocks
ingly evident at the climax oi the
film. Rosemary‘s [ears are allaycd
temporarily when her pregnancy
is diagnosed, yet, a strange. unset
tling undercurrent remains As her
bouts with what she believes to be
‘morning sickness' continue. her
elderly neighbor becomes ever
more cosseting and overbearing,
oiiering her glasses oi milk and
unidentified pills to make her feel
better The outcome at the [ilm is
shocking and terriiying.
Rosemary's child's iacc is ‘never

depicts Rosemary being raped by
