Bed and Sofa

by rrina Carpino

“Bed and Sofa," a satiric coin-
edy directed by Abram Room
in 1927, is an unusual min for
its time. As it analyzes the
changing role or the individual
in the new Soviet society, it adv
dresses the problems or inadce
quate liousin and women’s ls-
sites without geing overtly polltv
icnl. It is considered a landmark,
tor Soviet cinema, primarily be-
cause of its humor and natural—
ism in depictin its characters.

Room‘s detailed and intimate
psychological portraits depict a
woman struggiug between her
values and her husband. In the
midst of Moscow's acute hous-
ing shortage, her husband brings
home a friend to sleep on the
sore. However, beiore long their

ositions are reversed and the
rusband ﬁnds ‘himself on the
sofa. When the woman realv
izes she w regnaut and does
not know v rich mini is the fa-
ther, she is faced with a decision
which will effect the remainder
of her life. Her ultimate (le-
cisiou and Rooms sympathetic
portrayal of her as he addresses
such taboo subjects as adultery
and abortion make this ﬁlm one
of the ﬁrst to deal with the lib»
eration of women in Russia.

Zelig

Shot in black and white,
“Zelig,“ a pseudo—documentary,
tells the tale or Leonard Zelig
(Woody Allen) and Louise Flcte
cher (Mia Farrow}. Zelig, the
world {amous “chameleon man,”
is able physically to alter his
appearance in order to assime
ilate better with those around

him (tor example, Zeli becomes

alternately indian, baelr, and
obese}. When zelig is in the hos
pital or treatment of this condi

takes interest in his case, even-
tually talring him to her coun

and later marrying him,

for total appreciation to come
