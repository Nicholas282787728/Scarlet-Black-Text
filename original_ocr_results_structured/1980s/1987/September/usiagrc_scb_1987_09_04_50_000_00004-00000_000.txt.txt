Ollie NOrth: a modern

Raskolnikov?

by John C. Newmark

A Russian writer named
Dostoevsky wrote a long time ago
(before Russian women began cor-
rupting American soldiers) the
destined-to-become~famous novel
“Crime and Punishment." The
main character in this novel.
Raskolnikov, had a very strange
philosophy which may seem rele
vant today.

Raskolnikov liked to believe in
what has been called by some the
“superman" theory. This beliei
states that there are certain men
(women, too) who have the right, if
not the duty. to break the law if it
stands in the way oi overall good.
He considered himself one of these
“superman,” along with such pear
ple as Caesar, Napoleon, and Alex-
ander the Great.

Raskolnikov was a poor man and
was constantly selling things to an
old woman named lvanovich who
would then pawn the items,
lvanovich was a miserly lady who
gave little money to Raskolnikav
and his peers while hoarding the
money she made ior herself.
Raskolnikov considered her a
plague on the entire city,

Admittedly, this is a minute
description ot a vast novel, but
please bear with me, This
lvanovich lady had so much money

that ii she happened to die (by
some accident, oi course) the
money could be put to great use in
reviving the city. Raskolnikov
murdered her and buried the
money.

in discussing the theory, a iriend
oi Raskolnikov asks an intriguing
question. what happens when a
person believes he is a
“superman," but actually isn’t?
Should he be punishedi
Raskolnikov admitted there might
be a iew ilaws in his theory but did
acknowledge that it was the duty oi
the common man (the theoretical
opposite oi the superman) to en»
iorce the laws ii the individual
were caught. Raskolnikov was
caught lie was jailed Aiter years
of imprisonment he iinally reiorm-
ed.

in conclusion, what can we con
clude about the relevance oi this
novel today? ii anybody breaks the
law, regardless oi how noble his
motive is, it is the duty oi the com-
mon people to punish him. in this
manner, we can possibly deter
other commoners in the tuture
irom becoming inllated with ideas
or superiority. We are all created
equal. Some (North and Poindexr
ter, ior example) are not more
equal than others (like Congress or
the people)

 

Student advocates
curriculum addition

To the Editor:

The class oi 1991 should prove to
be an interesting group of people
as there has been an increase in
the number of international
students. Grinnell’s growing
reputation in the United States and
abroad is attracting international
students, This year in the class oi
1991 about ten percent of the
students are international
students. a ﬁgure which is larger
than many of the larger and 3p.
parcntly iamous colleges.
Moreover, some of the American
students have been exchange
students, spending some oi their

school years either in Europe or
Latin America. Many v.5.
students here are planning to take
courses in foreign languages. All
this indicates Grinnell is one of few
places where the understanding
between different cultures and
civilizations can take place,

To promote iurtber understan-
ding and cooperation between
diverging societies, the college
could incorporate the rich
philosophies and intuitive gems of
the great masters oi Muslim suiis.
Hindu materialism and others in

Students criticize

editorial

To the Editor:

There are times when the ad-
ministration or faculty of Grinnell
College needs to be criticized or
even condemned (i.e., cutting in
ternships, or the policy towards
South Alrica, respectively). when
the Scarlet and Black is used cheer
tively, it can be a usetul tool in con
veying the voices and consciences
of the Grinnell student body
However. the S and B will be of no
use to anyone — least of all the
students — if it continues to publish
editorials with such an obvious
lack of intelligence or foresight.

'How can the administration

seriously consider Scarlet and
Black editorial comments concern-
ing college policy toward South
Africa, if the S and B consistently
publishes criticism simply ior the
sake of criticism? We doubt that
the administration’s oversight in
identiiying the Black Cultural
Center is reflective of any underly-
ing racial prejudices; it ca only
damage the paper's credib ty to
imply as much, it is uniortunate
the s and B chose to begin the new
year on such a juvenile note. 7

briefs

At first I thought I would comr
pare SGA to a pair oi iishnet stock-
ings. the threads of which were
students, woven into a network
leading to their student govern
ment representatives. The waist-
band (SGA) would, in turn,

Liz Johnson

squeeze the body (comprised oi ad
ministrators and iaculty
members). But instead or
elaborating on this image oi SGA, i
would like to talk brieﬂy about how
-you can use SGA.

For those oi you who have ques-
tions about SGA. let me lay it out
ior you. Basically. SGA has two
missions. One is to allocate iunds
($140,000 per year, ii that helps),
and the other is to persuade the ad
ministration and the iaculty son
would ideally be accessible to all
students and be truly represen-
tative ot their issues and concerns,
This is where l reel son has its
largest task at hand. There will be
a fullrl‘orce eiiort this year to beat
it into the heads oi students that we
want their ideas and ieedback. at
course, this is not ior a lack oi ln~
telligence and creativity on the
part oi son members, but rather a
irustrated eiiort in search oi a
more democratic system. Thus tar
we have made the eiiort to make
this as easy as possible ior you, Not

only did we extend the deadline ior
senatorial elections, but we held an
open house and instituted a come
puter mailing system whereby
those who have ideas and questions
can quickly and eiiiciently have

access to SGA With a guaranteed
response to whatever they have to
say. A iew more words about the
computer.

Please use it. even if you'd like to
tell us what you thought oi last
week‘s concert. A minute or two of
your time will be enormously
helpful to us. it is my belief that too
many good ideas and valid com
plaints get lost over cups oicoiiee.
Next week's Column, almost
necessarily. promises to be even
more titillating and informative
than [his one, SGA is having its
first cabinet and joint board
meetings next week. Once again
give us your ideas.

 

McDonald explains party security

policy

It has come to my attention that
many upperclassmen are upset by
the new security policy ior all~
campus parties. I realize that in
the past. ii the security guards
knew a person. they would be
allowed into a party without an ID.
However, this year the security
stall is required to deny entrance
to anyone and everyone who does
not have prooi that they are a stu-
dent at Grinnell College.

The purpose of this letter is to ex-
plain the necessity oi a stricter
policy. First of all, there is the
question oi liability, not only ior
the college but ior the students
coordinating the party as well.
Since Grinnell has such a liberal
alcohol policy. it is necessary to
take extra precautions to avoid a
potential lawsuit. By checking
every person’s ID (or guest pass),
there is a 100 percent guarantee
that every person in the room is
authorized by the college to attend
that particular party. This would
effectively eliminate the major

problem oi past years 7 high
school students gaining access to
parties and causing or getting into
trouble. In addition. this stricter
policy creates a type oi security
blanket around the college, greatly
decreasing the possibility oi police
entering an all-campus party.
This, in turn, allows Grinnell Col-
legs to continue with its liberal
alcohol policy.

The most frequent Complaint has
been, “Well, the security guard
knows me. so why do I have to
show my ID?” The answer to that
question is twoiold. As explained
above, it creates increased securi-
ty for the college as a whole, and
secondly, in the interest oi
lairness. the policy must be consis
tent, Indeed, it would not be fair to
require new students and those
who do not irequent allcampus
parties to carry IDs, while others
are allowed in ‘with no ID. The
policy will not work unless it is ap-
plied consistently with NO EX-
CEPTIONS.

i realize there is a problem with
oflrcampus students not having or
needing IDs. l assure you that
steps are being taken by myseli
and Jim Tederman to .come up
with alternative solutions that
would not involve a major expense
to oiicampus students. it is hoped
that a solution will be iound this
week. Until then, please carry a
postcl'ﬁcerbox key to identity that
you are a student.

1 know this seems like an in
convenience to all, but it is only ior
the college and all our protection.
The college students and ad
ministrators have worked hard to
create and maintain a iair alcohol
policy and i know that all oi you
wish to see it continue. Most cola
leges do not allow alcohol con
sumption by ANY MINOR. So
please. comply with this small re»
quirement and let‘s keep those alla
campus parties happin'! !
