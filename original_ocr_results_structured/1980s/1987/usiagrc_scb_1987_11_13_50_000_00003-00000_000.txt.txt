The Scandinavian capitals have

completely unique lrom other \ll‘r

combination oi their geographical-

ioresight. particularly with regard
to environmental issues. than their
counterparts in other countries.
and they also employ both new and

interested in thoughtful urban

Students with suggestions tor
Dining Services have a new outlet
[or their opinions, For the iirst
time in eight years. SGA's Dining
Servtces Committee is active. The
committee. composed oi three
students. R.A. Lisa Frese. and
Dave McConnell of Dining Ser-
vices, now meets Thursday morn-
ings at 7:30.

According to Cindy Rybolt, one
student committee member,
“What happened was. i was
elected to Dining Services (Com-
mittee) and I asked around and
lound out who else was appointed
to it. We talked about it and decid-
ed that it could serve a
purpose. .Beiore (eight years
ago), it was an intermediary bet
ween Saga tood service and
students. but it iaded out aiter we
got our own service "

McConnell said the revival of the
committee reilects a new attitude
by students. “I think there is a new
interest in student lite on campus.
Students want to get involved

more I think it can be a very pro-
dutive committee." nyoolt agreed.
"Most people think it‘s a good idea.
I don't think people ielt betore that
they had an input."

The committee‘s current proyect
is a survey on how to change Suns
day brunch. The survey oiiers six
options tor meal plans on Sunday.
Rybolt said. "Whatever the
students pick, they tiood servtcesl
will do. We‘re not sure of campus
consensus so we're trying to iigure
out what people want and what
most people would be happy with.“

She added that the committee
has several plans for the future.
"We‘re trying to help out with cut»
ting in line at Cowles and en
courage students to exert a little
positive peer pressure We also
want to get student ideas ior
special dinners or student
recipes." Rybolt encourages
anyone with ideas to come sit in on
meetings “People should come in
and give whatever input they
have." she urged "We're looking
iorward to doiiiga voricty oi things
with it." McConnell said.
