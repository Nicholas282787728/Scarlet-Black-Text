After his native land of Laos fell
to Communist rule, King Ching
Vong was determined to get out.
She and it) other Laotians risked
their lives on a two-day boat
journey to Thailand, “here after
three years of overcrowded hous~
ing, no jobs, no money, and no
school, they received American
sponsorship and plane tickets to
Iowa.

Having lived here since
September. 1987. Vong is one or 7|)
Southeast Asian immigrants cur-
rently living in Grinnell. Most were
brought here under the sponsor-
ship oi the Mason iamily, who pres
vided two of their farm houses as
guaranteed housing ior the im»
migrants. in addition to housing,
the Masons gave money, transpor-
tation, and general education oi
American iiicstyles to the imr
migrants, Between 1975 and 1981,
their sponsorship allowed between
15 and 20 families to come to Grin-
nell.

sorship irom the Masons, other
Laotian immigrants such as Eran-
cis Lai did. Arriving in i975, Lai
lived on the Mason farm for four
years and began working as a
machine operator at the Robintech
plastic company. By 1979, he and
his iamily had earned enough
money to buy a house in Grinnell.

Lai adjusted easily to the
American work force, but other
transitions did not come as easily
for him. He found many customs

difficult to assimilate. "In LlaDSV
there is nothing to getting

wanted to marry a Chinese
woman. l had to get a license."

Social Customs were also dif~
ficult. “In Laos when you visit a
home. the host offers you a drink or
something to eat. in America you
must ask ior it. But I try hard to
learn. 1 have to keep up with
Americans and pick up their
customs.”
learning Enghsh

Other Southeast Asian
migrants have had difficulty learn-
ing English. Cambodian reiugee
Sol Paul Chay has lived in America
for over seven years and still has
trouble with English ”I go to
English classes, but it is very hard
work," she said. ”I am too old to
learn as easily as the children. it is
also very hard to imd a job because
people will not hire unless i speak
English.”’

Like most immigrants in Grin-
nell, Chay takes English classes
through a program given in the
Grinnell schools which teaches
English as a second language. “We
try to encourage them as much as
possible." said Nyla Rosenow,
head oi the program. ”The younger
ones catch on quickly, and some or
the adults work so hard and are
very motivated. They come irom a
culture mat has great respect ior
teaching.”

In addition to teaching English.
Rnsenow is also a member of the

im-L

Methodist Church refugee sponsor-
ing committee. “Our group offers
as much support as possible for the
new immigrants. We provide fur-
niture, household goods, and
clothing. We oiier private tutoring,
transportation. and help in finding
jobs,” she said. Federal aid is also
available through the Department
of Human Srvices, which provides
iood stamps, medical insurance,
and jobsearch services.

“At iirst, it was easy for im-
migrants to lind jobs," said
Rosenaw “But Since Roblntech
went bankrupt, it has become
hard. Many have had to move out
oi the community because there is
no work. For this reason, I would
not encourage more immigrants to
come here."

Those who have iound jobs have
been praised for their hard work.
“Factory employers have told me
that these people put American
workers to shame," said Gloria
Mason. “They're always on time.
they work hard, and they never
call in sick. At the same time, they
are not a threat to the working
community, for they are not taking

jobs away irom Americans
Rather. they take the low-paying
jobs that other people don't seem
to want,”

Proof oi a lack oi any hostility
lies in the iricndly relationships
that develop between the im
migrants and their American co,
workers. “When I first came here,
there were many things that i did
not understand,” said Lai. “My
iriends at work taught me about
the government and taxes. Also.
because I started my job right
away. i could not go to English
school. They helped me very much
to learn the language."

”The people here are very nice
to me," said Chay, who is a single
mother oi iour. “They help me
take care oi my children, and they
help with food,”

Social relationships, however.
are not as easily developed.
Because oi the strong iamiiy bonds
of most Southeast Asian im-
migrants. ireetime and weekends
are often spent at home or visiting
relatives in nearby towns. The con-
tacts that are made seem in-
valuable. “l have learned a
tremendousgamount from these
people," said Mason. “They have
wonderful, close families and a
great sense oi needing to work
together in order to make a go ior
it.”

”I feel that I have been blessed
by knowing these people.”
Rosenow said, “Even when there

Anthro prof cites locale, academics

by Julie Slivinsky

Grinncll may sound like the mid
die of nowhere to some new pres
lessors, but in many ways it seems
quite “civilized" to Barbara
Nowak. Nowak, an anthropology
proiessor on a two-year position at
Grinnell, spent two years gather-
ing inlormation in kampungs, or
Malaysian villages, ior her disser»
tation,

“I lived with a group of in-
digenous Malaysians from 1980 to
1982. looking at their lives and how
their lives are changing, with a
special focus on women.” said
Nowak. Although she had original-
ly planned to do her dissertation
work in Peru, Nuwak said that
aitcr receving her master's degree
at State University of New York at
Buffalo. she decided to go with her
advisor at Buffalo to Malaysia,
where he was going to do iield
work. “It was kind of like a mentor
type oi relationship,” she says “I
didn't know much about the area
The attraction was to work with
my advisor.“

Nowak ,lived alone, however,

with the group in an area where
there was no plumbing or
telephones. Nowak stated that she
had problems adjusting to the new
environment and with the people's
perceptions oi her, ”I had a very
rough time when i initially went in-
to are community. i had to prove
something to myseli.... As a single
woman, i had a hard time. The
other women were airaid l was try»
ing to steal their husbands. And I
was never considered an adult in
this community... Also, initially, I
didn't speak their language and
could only communicate with them
in Malay (not their usual
language).” Nevertheless, Nowak
conducted a thorough participant
observation study, “I tried to do
everything they did. I went crabb-
mg, worked on the plantations,
took care oi children, cooked. went
iishlng. There were tour or live
households that were my core
group, probably initially because
they iclt really sorry ior me, They
piticd me.”

Although Nowak lived in and
studied mostly a village oi 300, she

also studied villages as small as 10
to 20 people, and for a While she live
ed on a Zl'foot boat with 10 people.
“We used to sleep on iish scales at
night. it was hard living, but it was
very enjoyable." she said.

Alter completing the iield work,
Nowak returned to SUNY-Bul‘falu

to write her dissertation and then ’

she came to Grinnell. Grinnell was
Nowak's choice ior several
reasons. “1 went to Bard College
lior undergraduate education], a
school with 500 students, so i know
what the diiierence is between
SUNYrBuflalo and a small liberal-
arts college. i appreciate the in
teraction between students and

iaculty [at a small college], and I
wanted to get back with small col~
leges. The students challenge me
so I can’t get into a rut, which is
easy to do unless you're challeng-
ed I also picked it (Grinnelll
because I wanted to live in the
country ior a while. And it’s
warmer than where I came from,
which is nice. what i need to get
used to is the lack oi access to a big
city.”

In addition to teaching, Nowak
dabbles in photography and reads

on editing one book and writing

teach for a time and then taught at
Ohio State for a few years. Then
the recent Few Grant opened up a
classics position here at Grinnell,
and the happy hand oi iate brought
the Easterner out to Iowa.

”1 was a little terrified about go-
ing as tar as Iowa,” said Hughes.
But he added. “When I Visited here
I kind of liked it." Hughes preiers
the smaller classes here to the
larger classes he has taught at
Ohio State. He said, “(There were]
classes of up to 700 people at Ohio
state. This [Grinnell] is more like
Gerogetown,” The students at
Grinnell also strike Hughes as be-
ing more motivated than the
students at Ohio state, who can
easily slip into anonymity.

When he is not translating
Sallust or Virgil, Hughes has a
number of recreational outlets, He
enjoys playing softball and tennis
and is a big ian oi baseball, He is
also a Countryrmusic enthusiast
and enjoys playing country music
on his guitar. So iar, he has iound
only one other professor at Grins
nell who shares this interest.
Nevertheless, if he can find a
drummer and a fiddle player, a
country-music band is a delinite
possibility. Hughes also has an in-
terest in modern Greek culture and
has taken three trips to Greece ior
extended periods. He is interested
in archaeology. though he admits a
greater interest in the iinds than
the actual dig : “I just confine
mysell‘ to vis ng lriends who have
taken part in digs "

Hughes is pleased with the col-
lege and the town. Although he
cited the absence of a graduate
school as a drawback at Grinnell,
Hughes said, ”My impression so
far is that [in the future] I would
like to be Somewhere like Grinnell,
Thus far i’m very happy with the
job "
