French hesitance with

Features

polls due to

“Pathetic American”?

by Mayslee Chai

When I began my “soiidage. or opinion
poll, iwasn't sur how to st t rirst pros
blcm’ how to interview a cross-section of
the population. not Just students. Second
problem: once I'd found these people, how
to approach them. where to start‘7 What to
do7 The only thing I could do was jump in
and hope I could swim.

There at the bus stop, I see a young
woman about my age. probably a univei-si»

ty student. I practice my French in my«

head as I approach her

Bobby pins and mousse glistening in the
sun. her trosted hair is slicked back into a
pony tail. it is cold The wind is blowing
fiercely, I shiver in my down coat. She is
wearing a shirt Jacket. a “minirjupe”
tminisskirtt and black lace stockings.

"Pardon, estsce que tu as, uh.. uh,” I
wasn‘t sure whether to use the familiar
“In” or the lormal "yous." I smile
helplessly at tier stares.

“Pathetic American," I read in her face,
She lakes a drag trom her ciagarette and
blows smoke in my direction. The bus ar-
rives She leaves.

students are bumped and pushed up a nar—
row staircase, with the sense oi being slow-
ly

“Pardon, oucht" l yelp as an elbow iabs
my right ribs, I back up only to be pressed
against the wall as a new wave at hungry
students tloods Into the cafeteria.

My pollsresult papers rip, I lose my pen
when a back pack sideswipes my arm. I
flee.

Saturday morning I am off to the Place
de Lices, where there is an openrair

. market I was told by a French professor
that the French like to shop here {or pro
duce and poultry fresh lrom the country.

Stalls of fresh vegetables and fruits line
the cobblestoned streets followed by rows
oI glzissy~eyed fish, twitching crabs, cluck-
ing Chickens and comatose rabbits.
Stereotypes of French people in berets or
kerchiefs, carrying baskets and baguettes
till the market.

A woman stands beside a plastic shopp-
ing buggy tilled \vith iruit and endives.

YES--

-P.irdoii Madame, do you have a
minute? I'm conducting a survey, "

”N lioli, non. Mademoiselle. l have no
time. She w' s to a man in a beret.
”See. my husband is there." she says and
joins the flow in tloiiing shoppers

lsee ii couple at n clcincntiiie stand. The
uoman is bargaining With the merchant
while the man guards the baby carriage

“Pardon Monsieur, I say, smiling like
an American and proceed to explain my
survey. I

“Non. non. he says nervously. looking
over his shoulder at the woman. He turns
the baby carriage around. “Sorry, I am
busy right now," he says as he wheels the
baby away. ’

I try again with a woman selling egg
rolls "I don't speak French.” she says and
walks off.

I brave my way through swinging
baskets and snippy little dogs but no use. It
seems everyone is too busy shopping or
Chatting to have time to be polled

Now, I know where I must go. Sunday
afternoons the public garden is toll of
couples, iainilies, students strolling
Icisurely among the greenery, the aViary,
the duck pond It seems to be a perfect
place for my poll.

Sunday the weather is perfect, even
though it's gray 1n bretagne when it isn't
raining. the weather is good. I enter
through theierge, black. iron gates topped
with gold spikes. and walk up the gravcl
path. The garden stretches beioi-e me:
sculptured hedges shaped like birds.
ilower beds in paisley print patterns, a
fountain in the middle.

An elderly couple strolls by. the man
holding a Wooden cane with his wife on the
other arm. Couples hold hands and try to
see how close together they can get and
still walk. Families parade by, their
children and dogs impeccably dressed. i
‘ The wind carries the sound of a Sheet
musiman's tinny accordion. Children's
laughter combines with the tinkling of an
old carousel. A guard's shrill whistle ads
monishes a passer-by who has tread upon
the thick green grass

1 succumb i forget my "sondage " I
wrap my pen and stroll with the rest. Ah.
France,..,

we have end of the year shuttles

vided mansions. And this in a country irith
one oi the lowest standards oi living in the
world. Clearly. it is not the masses that
concern the Sandlnlstas. but rather tllCtl‘
own comfort,

A related liberal fiction is that the
. ~erage Nic ‘aguall is much better nit to-
d y titan he was under onioza, To a cer
taiiicxteiit. better olt' is relative Ifone
means by bctlcr’ oil that ti lorgcr percenr
tagc of Nicai aguans can read Communist
propaganda. then peiliaps the liberals
assertion is true it one means, however.
that the standard of living ls higher, then
the liberal assertion is unquestionably
{3150 Before the Sandlnistas took control,
Nicaraguans ate well by the standards of
other Central American countries Even
the poor were accustomed to eating such
foods as beef and chicken This is no longer
the case, however Goods available in
other countries in the region can no longer
be obtained by the masses in Nicaragua,
Malnutrition is omnipresent. Many
children have no clothing The result at
these shortages and outright absences has
been pervasive corruption.

And what of the vaunted literacy cams
paign? Much oi the iunding tor the pro
gram came irom the United states
Moreover, the Catholic Church in
Nicaragua was more responsible than the
government ior any improvements which
may have been made. It was the church
which provided the bulk of the assistance
tor the program Despite this eftort,
however. the purported improvement in
literacy rate is questionable Some who
“graduated" from the program cannot
even read their diplomas. Others ale Just
able to sign their names,

And what of the Sandinistas' ties with
the SOVIet Union? Some liberals, such as
Iowa's Tom Harkin. claim that U S
policies toward Nicaragua drove the San-
dinistas into the “arms oi the Soviets."
This is rather hard to believe, Constderlng
that the Carter Administration encourag-
ed and assisted in the ouster of Somnza
Furthermore, Carter gave the Saiidinistas
in one year the equivalent in aid of half of
what Somoza received over a span oi SIXV
teen years Clearly, the Sandililstas pure
sued Soviet ties because they were Com-
munist. not because U S actions in the
region left them with no cho’

unc oi the most fantastic claims by
liberals Is that the Sandinistas enjoy
widespread public support. The election oi
November 1984 is olten given as an exams
ple oi this support Certainly, one oi a
democratic mind would be hard pressed to
constder this election fair. The election
was much closer to those that take place in

didates were not given sufficient time to

ballots {mm the election were counted by
the Sandinistas. Al the delegation to
()rtcga‘s inaugural, fiitecn of the top six»
teen representatives were from Come
munist countries. Not 21 single Celitral
American government sent a special
delegation to the event,

it IS true. however. that the Sandinistas
manage to maintain a semblance of
popular support. They do so by dispensing
ration cards which must be used to obtain
many necessities, such as food. It one does
not attend mandatory Sandlnista
meetings. his ration card is coniiscaied.
But this support is only superficial.
Popular slogans include "The Sandinistas
and somoza are the same thing?"

I could go on. There are several other
myths perpetuated by liberal companion
of the Sandlnistas that need dispelling, but
space limitations don't permit me to
elaborate upon these. The massacres oi
the Miskito Indians, the imprisonment oi
church oificials who oppose the regime,
the delainment of anyone who criticizes
the government,.and, the trequenl total
censorship oi the opposition press call tor
eluctdation. But cataloguing Sandinista
atrocities is not my aim. The paint is that.
given liberal assumptions about the San.
dinistas, one can understand their support
ioi that government. But given realities
about the Sandinistas. one is hard pressed
to continue his support lat least ii he is a
democratl

I believe that liberals’ support for the
Sandlnlsta tyranny is immoral, and I think
it is time they concede that, The only
moral solution is to continue funding the
choir so that they can bring the
Nicaraguan Communists to gotiate in

on nest a settlement that would provide

for democracy in Nicaragua. illusions that
exist in the tertile minds of senile liberals
will not provide for that democracy.
