Repulsion

By Jill Ellis

REPULSION was Polish director
Roman Polanski’s second film, after his
dazzling debut with KNIFE IN THE
WATER. and was also his first film in
English, In many ways REPULSION
seems to be a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock.
as it reminds one of PSYCHO. The story is
fairly simple: we watch as a young woman
goes mad and becomes a pathological
killer,

Catherine Deneuve plays the young
French woman who is living in London
with her sister, Already mentally im-
balanced when we first see her, she is
linally driven over the edge by her own
repressed sexuality. as she is tormented
by having to deal with (and listen to) her
sister's carefree sex life in the next room

Polanski‘s use of the camera is wonder-
Iul: he follows the woman as she Sinks fur-
ther and further into insanity with a
ghoulish collage of images la skinned rab-
bit. a man's t»shirt. a razort and sounds
{water dripping. flies buzzing. clocks

tickingreven the laughter of nuns in a
neighboring convent becomes sinister).
However. while it is obvious that the
woman is suffering irom some sort of
Freudian complex involving a love-hate
relationship with her father, Polanski
never tells the audience exactly what is
driving this woman to insanity. but rather
iust displays her pathological tendencies--
graphically

The gore in this film is excessive: we
watch as the woman embraces a man
while holding a straight razor behind her
back, and then get a close-up as she slits
the back of his neck. then as she cuts his
throat with several grotesque slashes,
tThose with a faint heart or a queasy
Stomach should definitely avoid this film,)
The director's talent for realism and his
ability to shock are unquestionable;
whether this film serves any purpose other
than to scare its viewers sick. on the other
hand. is very questionable.

Indiana

by Ann Haker

INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE
OF DOOM brings back Harrison Ford as
the intrepid archaeologist we grew to love
in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. His
female sidekick in this film is an utterly
helpless and always whining nightclub
singer lrorn Shanghai, played by Kate
Capshaw, This film also introduces the
character of Short Round, a small boy who
is a whiz at poker and keeps Indy out of
trouble. The events in this film supposedly
occur before RAIDERS, although it is the
second film in the series, Most of the film
takes place in India (ﬁlmed on location in
Sri Lanka) with the opening and the few
very bloody scenes taking place in
Shanghai.

The action in this film revolves around a
cult which sacrifices people in a very nasty
way. The victim has his heart ripped out
(miraculously the person doesn‘t die imr
mediately). Then. while the heart is still

the kissing scene between Grant and
Bergman. The 1940's Hollywood censors
were extremely strict about kissing in mo-
tion pictures. A screen kiss could not last
more than three seconds. Hitchcock filmed
Bergman and Grant kissing while nibbling
on each other's ears. whispering sweet-
nothings. even talking on the telephone,
This technique adhered to the three
seconds rule, but the overall effect was the
most risque kissing scene of the time.

Great performances and direction make
NOTORIOUS a classic film. NOTORIOUS
provuies an excellent Showcase for
Grant's debonair screen personality and is
a htting part at Grinnells tribute to the ac
tor.

beating the Victim is burned alive, This
Cult has also stolen children from the
villages in the region and is forcing diem
to work a mine; a young king is among the
slaves. Indiana’s mission, should he chose

to accept it, is to free the children and
break the cult.

Along the way we are taken dirougli
various adventures. Steven Spielberg
spared nothing in coming up with several
gross scenes and one movie is not for the
taint at heart Spielberg sets a rast pace
with barroom brawls, sword fights, lots of
bugs, a roller coaster ride through the

inirlie. and an airplane with no pilot and no
no .

Some people think it’s a better tiirn than
RAIDERS, although many feel it is
needlessly gross, Nevertheless, lNDlANA
JONES AND THE TEMPLE or DOOM is
a good film in its own right.
