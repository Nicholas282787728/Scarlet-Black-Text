Senior comes to defence of Art

department

To the Editor:

I must take atception to the contents of
the editor's column in the April )0, 1987
issue of the Scarlet and Black. The column
was seemingly an effort to champion the
cause of Grinnell’s tine-arts departments,
which the editor asserts are “considered
by many students to be among the weakest
departments on campus." However, as an
art student, 1 see the column as adversely
aiiecting the art department through the
editor's illrconceived. unsupported
criticisms which are extended to all three
departments (art, theatre, and music),

I challenge that the art department is
much stronger than summarily portrayed
by the editor. At the risk of sounding like
an over—zealous tour guide, I would like to
present what I consider some oi the
strengths of the art department. The art
program oiiers some outstanding

'tacllities, such as the three presses in the
print studio, which Professor Robert
McKibbin describes as being better than
the presses he used as a graduate student.
There is now a large, visible gallery in the
Forum where students may show their

To the Editor:

Paul Draus wrote a column for last
week’s Scarlet and Black As usual. he has
managed to oiiend some segment or Grinr
nell's population by gloriiying his own igr
llorzince. I am afraid of what next week
will bring: an attack on homosexuals, the
mentally or physically handicapped. iat
people. people with glasses. or people who
breathe in such a way that offends him.
And. knowmg the Scarlet and Black's
general policy oi “it it's controversial.
\i‘c‘ll print it.” I'm sure I'll soon be reading
at Mr Di'aus' next new. exciting, and tar:
ribly witty prejudice

Mr. Dl-aus' most recent column dealt
with liis experience in the South Side of
Chicago. an area well known for its racial
tensions. Mr, Draus, an obvious product oi
these tensions, accidentally traveled into a
place uniamiliar to him. a place where he
was ”pretty sure there weren't any nice
shopping malls." And while he was there.
he was afraid. He was afraid because he
was white. and everyone there was black.
And. for that reason alone. everyone there
would try to heat him up

Alter talking to my friends, i realize that
this is a lairly common iear, albeit irra
tional. And, I realize that fear based on a
racial prejudice must bc conironted. Fur-
thermore, I realize that a public forum
such as a college paper is a legitimate
place to coniront this fear. Untol-tuantely,

volunteering a home phone number in the
event a student is experiencing diiiiciilty
with a new process, welcoming students to
a downtown studio for an informal get-
together, etc. We have presently a visiting
printrmaker, Laurie Ourlicht irom New
York City. teaching lithography. The
history division has been enlarged over the
last couple of years to include Asian art.
And finally, the drawing class has had to
expand to three sections to meet the con-
sistent demand,

1 do agree. and so would any oi the art
faculty, that there is always room for im7
provement. Even with a third section of
drawing being oitered next semester, the
iigure drawing sessions, open to the entire
student body and essential to a wellr
rounded drawing education, have been
canceled due to lack of funding. (I'll spare
you the obvious references I could make to
logos and all that jazz.) The ceiling tiles in
the print studio (Steiner basement) are
liable to fall into the midst of creativity at
any time. The sculpture studio is not a
studio but a former storeroom devoid of
natural light in the basement Of ARH. We
could use a third studio professor. Etc.

The department does have such
strengths as listed above, however, and
columns which characterize it as one of the
“weakest departments on campus" can
only set us back, 7 Lisa Stooge '87

by Draus’ “hollow

i don't believe that Mr. Draus has cons
fronted his prejudices at all. Instead. he
wrote a column about a fairly innocuous
experience and dressed it up with pretty
phrases and turned it into an example of
acceptable racism. And this offends me
Perhaps because i have some of these pre»
Judices myseli. Perhaps because this iear
oi poor blacks is so deeply woven into our
society, Perhaps because his column uses
the hollow liberalism of Grinnell as its at
cuse, or perhaps because Mr Draus
doesn‘t see anything wrong with his prer
judice.

ldo 1 recognize thataii irrational icaroi
impoverished blocks is a fairly common
prejudice, and that violent incidents are
sometimes triggered by r‘acism. but to
take an innocent rip on the El and turn it
iiito thc immortal struggle between the
good whites and the evil blacks is
ridiculous at best and offensive at worst.
Maybe I would feel better if Mr, Di‘aus had
seemed concerned with his ieclings, or had
realized that he might have been wrong, or
if he had seemed sincere. But. he didnone
of these things.

A column based on the racist principles
of the writer and a swastika emblazoned
on ARI-I are both controversial. Both must
be conironted. The underlying prejudices
of both must be Changed. Neither of them
is right. — Kristen Pulleii 'im

Student calls for regulation of Bitnet

To the Editor: , \

Last week article on Billiet by Susan
Prout is a line or inplc oi how the network
is being misused and why GCCS should
remove it or sharply regulate its use. To
quote Ms Prout,‘ tudents writc . . . about
various topics rnging iroin religion and
politics to relationships and music." This
is exactly the kind ot use that Bilnel
guidelines discourage and/or prohibit
From the GCCS News document on Bitnct.
o'nc read “Above and beyond all that has
been stated, it is most important that
Bitnet be used ior serious work and not ior

playing uround,‘ Thereioi-e, the advice by
Ms Prout that any Grinnellioiis are
ever really lonely all they have to do is
log on to Blinet. is entirely inappropriate

if the use of Bitnet continues to cause the
problems il has been, then perhaps its use
should be severely limited and regulated.
Perhaps the iuiids being paid lor its use
could be used to expand the number of ser-

Grinnell’s "invisible trustee,” Hector,
has arranged to have a new social center-
snack bar open in Quad basement, where
the Pub used to be This new establish
ment, which will bear Hector’s name, is
planned as “a weapon in the fight against
student boredom,” Hector said. “Grinnell
is a fine academic institution. and
academics are definitely the center of the
action, but it is important that we not lose
sight oi our broader role as members oi a
social, interactive society. I’m hoping
that my new place will help students learn
to relax and to socialize, . Plus, it'll be a
great spot to get munchies and drink
beer,"

According to Hector, once he realized
what had to be done, he had to find the peo-
pie to do it. He decided to empower a com-
mittee to handle the details and are
rangements. For this committee he chose
a small group oi creative, intelligent, and
hard-working students and ad-
ministrators: Bob TownerrLarsen. Shane

Wright, and Ted Amann. Dave McConnell.

Hector says that his doors will open on
Monday. April 20. and he expects a great
turnout. “We’ve got some great stuii
down here,” he said, “We’ve got pizza, hot
nachos, and deli sandwiches tor the
hungry, and a variety oi soda-pop and
mocktails tlike at the Health Center barl
tor the thirsty. Plus, those who are old
enough can bring down their own beer and

video games, pinball, and pool The
jukebox is back, and we’re lining up some
great live acts, like John Jensen and the
Jazz Ensemble, Although we don‘t have a
Tv yet, we plan to get one as soon as we've
got the money. And as soon as the damage
done to the iootball table last semester is
repaired, we’ll try putting that back in.
Hopefully the lierksi that did that

Although Hector's Place will iirsl open

Brown and Draus

To the Editor.

1 would like to respond to a few of the
items in recent Opinion sections or the s or
B. First, and foremost, I would like to
answer Barbara Brown's recent letter
(April 10, 1937). Barbara's understanding
of individual rights seems to be, like her
knowledge of constitutional law, "scant,"
She seems to notice no distinctions bet-
ween the two crimes she addresses. Yet a
Simple analysis yields: (1) kidnapping 7
in which a person is forced to go to or re
main in a location against his/her will,
strangulation 7 a deadly assault against
another person, and setting someone on

smoking marijuana in the privacy oi one’s
home. I can see a glaring diiierence bet»
ween the two crimes considered; smoking

living creature. nor to any property, nor
am I planning such harm. what right does

Concerns the View of "outsiders," like
minorities and urbanities, portrayed by
Paul Draus (April ll), 1987) and Jim Dune
