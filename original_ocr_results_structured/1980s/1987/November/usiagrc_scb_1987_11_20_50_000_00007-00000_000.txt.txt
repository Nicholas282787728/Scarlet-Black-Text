On Friday. the team will join issue
with Washington University in a
dual meet at home. Coach Ober-
miiler claimed that the meet would
undoubtedly be the toughest duel oi
the entire season The pressure
won’t let up on Saturday. when the
team contronts several tough con
tenders in the Pioneer Relays.
Competition includes Drake.
Wichita State. North Eastern
Missouri, Washington University.
Cue. Cornell. Buena Vista. and
Mankato State. The experienced
and respected words of obern-iiiler
seemed to sum up the debatable
outcome of the Relays: “The com-
petition is tough. Several diflerent
teams could win this meet. But
they'll have to win it over our dead
bodies!" Froese added bitterly. “I
don't know who will win the meet
...l just want my goggles back!

Regardless ot the outcome. the
Pioneer Relays promises to be a
barnburner of a meet. The excite-
ment of competitive swimming,
coupled with the inspired cheers of
“G0 BUDDHA." make the Relays
an experience that no Grinnellian
shuld miss

semester, We reviewed plans tor

renovated. beginning in spring
1999. Currently perhaps 50
workstations (Macs or IBM-

board in three separate locations.

But the main discussion topic
was student access to computing.
More specitically. are there
enough computers. and are they
available to students when they
are wanted? What is the right
balance between specialruse
machines and ones which do
everything but only halfway? The
survey intormation is expected to
help us in this regard,

There have been persistent
rumors that Computer Services

Do you know that this money could

qualitied people who liked Grinnell
College. but whose ideas threaten-

Communication is a valuable
learning experience. as the
Speakeasy has recently
demonstrated, The students' in-
creased feeling of detachment and
lack of input may not have reached
the White House on Park Street
and the rest of the buildings in our
community. Perhaps we don't care
enough because we will leave in
tour years having internalized the
“don‘t rock the boat” values of
some of the institutions of Grinnell
College.

These are just some specitic ex»
amples ot the way decisions are
made at this college today. 1 am

. sure that you can think oi many

others yourselves. Racism and its
implications in the quality or our
education; new buildings; Dave
McConnell’s tood serVice. ,.Regar-
ding all the institutions that aliect
us. all ol us need constantly to
question. both in our own minds
and in public. how decisions are
made and for whose benefit. Our
Grinnell Experience shall be in
tluential throughout our lives,
Surely, all ot us must move on to
lace our life‘s next challenge.

practice and it consisted mostly of
Danny Manning slamdunking over
his teammates in an intrasquad
scrimmage. The 16.000 people who
stayed up until midnight to watch a
basketball team practice are pro-
bably the same thousands oi pear
ple who flock to Graceland in order
to pay homage to the King. Mid-

you have a sociology paper and a

The Duke tans are by far the
most fanatical of all sports spec-
tators and are famous [or their in»
novative stunts against the opposi—
tion. For instance when they learn-
ed that NC State‘s Chris Washburn
stole a stereo. Duke fans threw
records at him on the court. When
NC State's Lorenzo Charles stole
pizzas lrom the pizza delivery
truck. the Duke fans showered him
with pizza boxes, imagine what
would happen to the basketbalti
court is the Duke tans ever learned
that ACC players were stealing
barbells from the weight room.
Better yet. imagine what would
happen here it a Coe player was
caught stealing all the backpacks
on this Campus.

Grinnell fans don’t have to be as
maniacal as the Duke or Kansas
tans. But when you come to the
game. yell at the opposing coach.
call the referee a bum. and cheer
on your fellow student athlete. So
come out to the Big Barn on Eighth
Street. and make basketball part
oi your Friday night‘s total enter-
tainment package.

waited patiently for their chance to
speak, (Add your own pet
peeves...) How will these tenden-
cies express themselves once we
leave our ”selfemployed" student
status". Which group of friends will
be invited to cut in at the front of
the employment linev whose
voices will be heard in the
newspapers we publish? The ac
tivities that simply annoy us today
may set a pattern of activity that
will infringe on our civil rights and
freedoms in the future,

While we are students in Grin-
nell. we can all tight racism by
supporting activities that foster ’
human respect and by actively
resisting those actions which deny
the dignity and rights of ourselves
and others. The best way to
“educate ourselves” against
racism is to teach one another to
respect the most basic human
dignity that each one of us has. it
just may be that our most Signlii‘
cant advances against racism in
the tuture begin in a dinner line at
Cowles. — Richard Patl 'titl
