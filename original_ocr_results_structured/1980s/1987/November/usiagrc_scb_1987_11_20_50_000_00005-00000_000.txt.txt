Sports writer
jresponds to critique

.To the Edito
Last week s issue oi tho 5 and B
ontained several letters and col
umns lamenting the quality oi the
riting in this paper As many oi
ou who read the sports page are
aware, i am a writer ior the paper
and thereiore am suppposedly
guilty oi the poor quality oi writing
that exists, To anyone whom i have
oiiended. i am sorry.

But should i be sorry” i too came
to the conclusion that the attitude
on this campus toward athletics is
at best apathetic. instead oi whine
ing in a letter to the paper about
how bad the writing is. i made a
sincere attempt to change that at»
titude by getting people aware oi
the iootball program and pleading

”with the campus to get out to the
iield ior home games and support
the team. Clearly, l have not been

as total iailure since several

members or the team told me per-
sonally that they appreciated the
eiiort which i was making.

How many of the people who
complain about the quality oi the
writing have made any attempt to
change it? i know that the sports
editor had such a diliicult time get-
ting people to write the sports are
ticles that some people had to dou-
ble up sports. I had no intention oi

.writing on the iootball team this
year but was asked to Further.
how many people out there in
readership land have made any

Political scene i

suggestions to any writer lor the
paper on things which they might
do bettert Only one suggestion was
made tome all season and that was
made by a person asking me to in
elude the name oi her ‘man' in my
article, I happily complied.

i think no writer, at least in my
own part oi the paper, is guilty oi
anything more than possessing a
poor sense oi humor 1 can only
speak ior myself. but I make no
claim to be a ‘journalist‘. i am a
humble chemistry maior who has
more than a passing interest in
sports. That is why 1 accepted the
assignment oi writing ior the
paper out oimy own time. Perhaps
people don‘t appreciate the iact

that most of H16 Writers for the l

paper are taking time out oi their
own busy schedules to not only
write, but also to cover the events
they write about

what i am trying to say is this: ii
you have a complaint about the
way the paper is run. send a com-
puter message to the person in
question. The last issue oi the
paper consisted, to a large extent.
or people complaining about one
thing or another, i realize that this
letter is or the same type as those 1
am condemning. but I hope that
this will be enough said on this
topic, — Walter J. Malay, Sport

Senior faces life’s
next challenge

in my iourth year oi being a stu»
dent at Grinnell College, i have
learned to approach things
analytically and critically. This
college has enlightened inc and
many others. However, this time i
do not wish to increase social
awareness about all those positive

views may not agree with the
positive-only stances oi the Col~
lege‘s recent public image

honesty and openness will provide
the most productive atmosphere

We aim to be an educated and in-
tellectual society and to construct
a world in which instead oi eXs
periencing disruptive change. we
can decide our own destiny. Don't
we? We can progress through an
evolutionary process to address
issues most eiiectively and
economically only by being aware
oi the signiiicanoe oi the institu-
tions that most closely surround
and aiiect our lives.

Take this as my philosophy and

Register headline on page 8A read,
“Kennedy said discriminating by

‘revealed that Anthony Kennedy,

last.

- Though ‘it seems centuries, it
was only a iew months ago that,
iollowing Powell's retirement in

,late June, President Reagan
nominated Robert Bork to replace

1 him. Due to Bork‘s ideology, which
many ieared ignored the American

' citizens' right to privacy, Bork was

Arejected tirst by the Senate
Judiciary Committee, and

aultimately by the entire Senate.

Howard Baker then suggested to
President Reagan that Anthony
Kennedy should be the next
nominee, However, Ed Meme pro»

ill-fated choice of Douglas
Ginsberg. Nobody knew what
Ginsberg stood ior, but they soon
found out that he had smoked
marijuana at age 30. Due to some
encouragement by the administra-
tion, Ginsberg withdrew from the
nomination. Now we have witness

nomination of Kennedy to the high
court. For a iew days everybody
thought the battle was over. Ken-
nedy had never smoked mari-
juana, but he ideologically sup
ported the citizens' right to
privacy. Leading Democratic
Senators. ever since Powell
reu'red, had included Kennedy on
their list or judges they would con-
sider supporting. While he wasn't
considered conservative enough by
many Republicans, it appeared
that Reagan had given in to
pressure, and the nation would
iinally iill the vacant seat on the
Supreme Court.

There is a hole in the Code
through which Kennedy probably
can escape. The Code gives the
judge the responsibility to decxde
whether any oi the organizations to
which he belongs practices “in-
vidious discrimination." Kennedy
will probably claim the organiza»
tions to which he belonged did not.

The situation is similar to what
Ginsberg faced when it was reveals
ed that he had possibly violated a
conflict—oisinterests law, Kennedy,
with a little bit or skill, will be able
to slip through this noose that has
been thrown around his neck.

days that two of Kennedy's best

ed the press about Ginsberg's
marijuana use, then Kennedy may
be sacrificed on the altar oi the
