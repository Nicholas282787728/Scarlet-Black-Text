outside shots

"There’s no question that we'll finish
better than last year's seventh place."
said Freeman. -it's just a question or by
how much. our sprint and distance crews
are strong and ready to go. it our field
events‘ peoplc periorm
capable. I think we'll do very well. I've
never felt better about an outdoor team go-
ing into the conierence meet."

Many ot the Pioneer tracksters finished
their season last weekend at the Coe Inn
vitational, While quite a few of the
conferencerbound Gi‘innelllans took last
weekend off entirely, several used the In-
Vltational [or training purposes, and a few
turned in outstanding performances.

Abby Green placed lir§t and set a new
school record ol 52" in the high jump. She
also was second In the long jump and liith
in the zoo, Shavaun Adams captured iirst
in the 10,000 meters with her time 01' 39:36.
Vlhile Joanne Sackett was Second in the
javelin and Blair Davisoil was fourth in the
50% meters. Trini Campbell, Sackett and
Hexdi Hopkins went 3-4-5 in the 400 XM
hurdles.

As ior the men, Freeman commended

Steve Harold and Steve Piper who, using
the i500 as a training run {or speed work,
turned in “very last times."
_ “The meet served its purpose as far as
improving on our seed times lor cone
{erence and as a last training run beiore
this weekend.” said Evelyn Freeman.
Coach Freeman also noted the opportunity
to become familiar with the Coo lacility in
preparation [or the league meet. ‘
