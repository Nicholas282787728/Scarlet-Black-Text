The Opium Weir

by Bruce Emond

THE UPIUM WAR tells of the struggles
of the Chinese to rid their land of the opium
trade during the mid-13th century. The
heroes of the ﬁlm are assorted workers,
peasants, and soldiers who band together
in their quest to end the foreign domination
of their land The film centers on Lin Tses
Hsu, a Chinese viceroy in the port city of
Canton who was the leader of the fight to
end Britain’s importation of opium from
India.

Originally made in 1963 under the title
LIN TSE-HSU. this film was banned with
the advent of the Cultural Revolution and
was not shown in China until l978. In the
same year, after six years oi negotiations
and payment of a $1 million fee, the film
had a limited run at a New York theater.

The film is in Chinese with English sub-
titles.

American reviews ol THE OPIUM WAR
were generally negative. Harold
Schonherg, writing in the New York
Times, Ielt that it was “not a good ﬁlm."
and said, “technically it is poor, with
washedout color and badly handled tran-
sitions. The plot has the usual stereotyped
situations." For all its flaws, however,
THE OPlUM WAR is a cinematic curio,
the first film from mainland China releas»
ed in the West aiter the artistic drought of
the Cultural Revolution. Go see THE
OPIUM WAR and decide its merits, or
lack thereoi, ior yourself.

The Quiet Man

by Bruce Emond
“John Wayne rarely strayed irom his
patented image as a strong, tough loner in
numerous westersn. In THE QUIET
MAN, a 1552 film for which director John
Ford received an Academy Award, Wayne
departs from the “blood and guts” fodder
oi his usual roles and plays an exrprize
fighter, Sean Thornton, who retires to his
ancestral Village in Ireland, There he falls
in love with and marries a tempestuous

redhead, played with her usual ilair and _

intensity by Maureen O‘Hara.

Problems arise when the woman's med
dlesome brother (Victor McClaglen) tries
to break up the marriage. Thornton meets
the barrage of taunts with customary
Wayne stoicism but eventually elects to
tight him in a norholds-barred boxing
match (“sometimes a man's gotta do what

a man's gotta do“) Intertwined with this
are Thornton’s endeavors to tame his fiery
bride. which attempts are, of course,
ultimately successiul,

The plot, essentially a variation at
Shakespeare's “The Taming of the
Shrew,” is trite and the relationship bet
ween Wayne and O’Hara, with his calm
masculinity offsetting her “feminine fail-
ings” oi temper and impetuosity, is
unintentionally camp. The supporting cast
includes Ward Bond and Barry Fitzgerald
who, with McClaglen, were members of
Ford’s stock ensemble of actors. The real
reason to see THE QUIET MAN, however,
is (or the stunning lrish panorama oi roll-
ing hills and lush green dales, all displayed
in sumptuous Technicolor.

a good

by Brian strause

BADLANDS features the 1973 version of
James Dean, a protagonist who is a rebel
without a cause or a motive for random
murder. Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen)
impresses his girliriend Holly Sargis
tsissy Spacekt by nonchalantly executing
inconvenient bystanders with the concern
it takes to spit on the sidewalk.

The killers imagine themselves as
players m a romantic table. The virtually
brainrdead girl, played so easily by
Spacek. idolizcs Kit as though he were a
knight in shining armor tnot quite like the
knights I remember from my childhood 7
brave young men who sweep young
maidens away from the ugly routine of
their boring lives). Kit fails to comprehend
the complexities of this characterization
and, in effect, makes love to Holly through
the cool power of murder. Holly is so besot»
ted by her Deancsque desperado that she
grateiully accepts the shooting of her
father as a romantic necessity.

At first glance this film seems to have
strong ties with the previously released
BONNIE AND CLYDE, but on a Wider
scope the plot closely resembles the in-
famous killing spree oi Charles
Starweather and his fourteensyearsold
girlfriend, Caril Fugate This realsllie
‘rebellious duo set the precedent for our
cinematic psycho killers as they
gallivanted across the plain states in 1958
scattering bodies along their path like
stale crumbs. it is a shame that the
premise at this film was not acknowledg-
ed; maybe then Fugate, who was still in
jail at the time of the film’s release, would
have received some fan mail in praise oi
her “heroics.”

What’s the inn of murder if no one pats
you on the back? Apparently this thought
went through Kit's mind as he turned
himseli in shortly after Holly’s capture,
The authorities have also been sucked up
by this cheap display oi romanticism as
police and guardsmen push each other out
of the way to wish good ol‘ Kit “good luck."
One of the law men even says to Kit,
”You're a real individual"; what ever hap»
pened to those glory days of yesteryear
when mass murders had some Godrgiven
integrity? ,

Try to ignore all the fun these lovers
have in their crusade to stamp out ins
nocence and restrain yourself irom acting
out these party‘ gags at home,

in 1958. a nineteen-year-old from South
Dakota, Charles Starkweather, gained na—
tional notoriety when he and his fourteenr
yeaiuold girliriend went on a weeklong
shooting spree that resulted in the deaths
oi 10 people. Terrence Malick has adapted
the Starkweather story to create the
deceptive and disturbing film
BADLANDS

BADLANDS is depicted as a storybook
romance (mm the point ofa fourteen-year-
oid (Sissy Spacek). When Spacek and her
widower lather move to a small town in
South Dakota. the young girl is courted by
a seltabsorbed garbage man (Martin
Sheen) who feels qualiﬁed to comment
lreely on life with his inane maxims and
who enjoys being likened to James Dean,
When Spacek's famer does not allow the
two to see each other, Sheen impassively
shoots him down. The two “lovers” [lee
and what follows is the tale of their ﬂight
across the Badlands, leaving a trail of
bodies behind them.

The story is conveyed with narration
from the starry-eyed iourteenyearpld
girl. Spacek, in one 01 her first big ap-
pearances. displays her acting talent as
the immature young girl who grasps on to
“true love” with Sheen, only to drop it in
an unassuming manner ten murders later.
Martin Sheen’s performance is excellent.
He portrays the garbage man and self-
styled desperado with disturbing
believability, His periormance suggests
that the killer’s ultimate motivation is at
tention

BADLANDS is a twisted love story about
two confused lovers. It unsettles the
viewer in its seemingly tranquil surface
accompanied by a violent sub-text,
