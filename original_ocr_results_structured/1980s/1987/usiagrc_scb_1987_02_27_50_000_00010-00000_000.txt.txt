tiliing to ALIENS is like sitting down at a
gourmet restaurant, orily to be served a
Big Mac and fries, Before this film Came
ci-en light years near your local theatre.
Time magazine had already heralded it as
"this summer's megahit," August hadjust
begun, and we were expected to run out
and see "a cool. convincing heroine" try
the flesh off of aliens whose lives were gos
itig on perfectly fine before our govern
ment set up shop in their part 01 the
galaxy, Cheering for the massacre oi
"aliens" ~ like patting Ronald Reagan on
the back each time he sends a check to
Nicaragua. ' ,

Let us not target that ALIENS is just a
sequel. which in this case means a strip oi
uncreative Celluloid. The same special et»
leizts are used as in ALIEN. but about
ten~times more often than in the original
There are a new director and producer
lJames Cameron and his wifel who had
nothing to do with the original. but who,
nonetheless. claim to have admired it..
Then‘ admiration has driven them into the
cesspool of plagiarism The original pro-
ducer declined Cameron's offer to work on
ALIENS because he said he felt he would
be gging out an old bone in the back
yard."

ALTENS is the story oi the battling

original. Ripley has drilled through space
in a deep sleep ior 7 years. Fortunately,
the space marines rescue her just in lime
to send her deceptively on a mission to
Allen Land (or the Planet of the Lost Col-
oiiyl. No one really believes her tales of
the illoodrthi ‘ty slugs. but she is still
brought along - a consultant.

colony is a little girl named Newt 0h.

ALIENS has the charm ol ZI counterfeit

Thermos! successiul movie genre oi the
past iew years has been bloody. Violent
films like RAMBO, ALIENS. released last
summer. is the cream oi the crop. Don‘t
get me wrong; ALlENS is. in one sense
(the violence). like RAMBO. but in all
others it is tar superior. it is a suspenseiul.

the edge of its collective seat, Theie is a
special warning. however. tor viewers oi
ALIENS; sitting next to an easily frighten
ed person can cause loss oi circulation in
your hand or other extremities. and could
possibly lead to gangrene.

ALIENS, like its predecessor ALIEN.
stars Sigourney Weaver as the heroine,
Ripley, who keeps her head when no one
else can manage to. (I am reminded oi
Boulder‘s Rule: "If you keep your head
while all those about you are losing theirs.
you'll be the only one‘ needing a haircut."l
The iilm also brings in many other great
characters. such as the female marine
who is a "real man" and would never eat
quiche. the slimesbucket who works for
"the company" but is "one of the good
guys a good android tin ALIEN the
android worked tor "the Company" and
was unreliablel, a lovel'sfriend character.
and. of course. the young girl. Newt.

At the beginning oi the movie. Ripley is
awakened from the hibernation she
entered at the end Ul ALIEN. She is asked
to accompany a group oi marines on a
lact~linding mission back to the piaiiet
where she and hcr crew were nearly wiped
out When they arrive at the colony which
has been established on the planet, there is
no sign oi the colonists The only surVivor
appears to be the young girl. Newt.

The fun begins as they encounter the
iii-st til the aliens. Slowly but surely, the
marines are killed oil This is where the
sequel surpasses the original in suspense
mid general tun. The story has a lew
moments of calm for the audience to catch
its breath. but action follows directly on
lranquility's heels it becomes a tight ior
survival with the aliens all around them
and little hope at getting out alive, Then
the young girl disappears and Ripley is
determined to save her. This brings on the
coiiirontation between Ripley and the
queen of the aliens The iintil l'ight‘is very
predictable. but the him is so well done it
doesn‘t matter It is rated PGslil. So any of

The humor of DUCK SOUP is based on
onesliners and puns. When the state brings
Chico to trial for treason. the prosecutor
declares "We'll have to eliminate that

natural that the instigators of such humor
should become involved in a war.
