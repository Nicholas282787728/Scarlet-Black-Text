Chinese Photography
Exhibit Continues

by Julee Brown

The second part of the exhibition ”Pek-

ing 1910-1912: A Photographic Diary”

_ opened on Wednesday in the basement of
Burling Library. The first half of me ex-
hibition, which represents the urban and
rural working class, is iollowed by
“Aristocrats and Goverment Officials,
Priests and Rituals,” This Series of por-
traits and regional studies oi early
twentieth—century Chinese society was
photographed by Lucy Monroe Calhoun,
wite oi the man who was then U.S.
Minister to China.

As a woman affiliated with the
diplomatic corps, Calhoun was able to
observe this transitional society from ﬁle
perspectives oi both the ruling elite and its
subjects, a position of great significance
after the Republican Revolution oi 1911.
Although this revolution failed to destroy
the country’s feudal structure and the
bonds oi imperialism. it succeeded in oven
throwing the empire. the last indications of
which are the present focus of the exhibi-
tion.

Calhoun’s portraits of the Manchu
aristocracy attest to the relative consera
vatism of early Republican China, The
elaborate brocade costumes and opulent
settings shown in the official portraits
demonstrate the abiding wealth and
leisure oi the aristocratic class, while
royal weddings and iunerals are shown
still attended by all the pomp and regalia
expected oi imperial China.

Also remaining intact amid the
bourgeois discontent of this era were the
religious institutions of the old order.
Several photographs in this exhibition por-
tray priests and monks in traditional garb;
the presence oi worshipers or all ages
legitimizes their message. Particularly
instructive is “Manchu Woman Praying,”
wherein the orthodoxy oi religious beliei is
indicated by the prayer papers scattered
over the temple grounds

A gallery talk on Calhoun's visual essay
will be given by Anne Burkus. instructor in
art, and Zengtong Xu, professor in the
Chinese language, at 4:30 on Tuesday,
March 3, in the basement oi Burling
Library.

“The Dining Room”
Opens Tonight

by Carl Thelin with Bruce Emond

A.R Gurney. Jr.’s ”The Dining Room,"
which will be shown irom Friday,
February 20 through Monday, February 23

' in the Arena Theatre, is a unique play in

that it does not center on any one person or
group of people. Instead. it is a collection
of short, unrelated scenes that all take
place in the same d.nlng team, The same
actors reappear in scene after scene,

and scenes overlap, with one starting
before the last one has ended.

The play revolves around the often ab~
surd conﬂicts in the lives of various upper-
class WASP families who own the same
dining room over a number of years, “I am
not in agreement with the values oi the
play, which are pro-WASP, but at the same
time i think the script allows a critique oi
those values," said Joanne Gates, a
visiting instructor in theater and director
of “The Dining Room,” Gates chose this
play in part because she did not know the
strengths oi Grinnells pool of actors; “The

Dining Room" requires versatility rather
than the ability to play one specilic type oi
part. However, Gates liked the play
primarily because “each individual
actor ..gets to try at Intel diiicrent things,”
The challenge of playing several roles
does not bother cast members. “I think Hie
changes all go pretty well," said cast
member Glenn Widmer. Jenny Jones said
that the only times when changing
Characters is diiiicult is when a change in
emotional tempo is needed. “Transferring
is kind of hard when I have two scenes
right next to each other, and one is a really
intensive, emotional scene, and the other
is a totally comic scene," said Jones.
Gates feels that the production is well
suited to the Arena and appreciates the
possibilities oi directing a play that can be
watched from all four sides. In addition to
Widmer and Jones, the cast includes Tom
Beverly, Dawn Helsing, Paul Herman,
Ken Jacobsen, Kulli Learning. and Shelly
Sandel. Performances will begin at 8 p.rn.

Kotke ,Dazzles
With Virtuosity, Humor

by Sam Perlman
Like the greatest of the blues and folk
musicians oi the past, Leo Kotke quietly
slipped into town'wlth nothing but his
guitar, But, oh, what he did with that
guitar! Leo Kotke dazzled the crowds with
his virtousity at both of his standing-room-
only shows last Saturday at the Forum,
Playing mostly instrumentals, Kotke
showed where years of practice can lead
to. Kotke combines the iingerpicking style
of classical guitar and the bottleneck-slide
technique of the blues into what he calls
“contemporary guitar stutl!" Kotke adr
mits, however, that he has not done a lot of
classical playing. He claims his major in-
ﬂuences come from the music of the

Using the slide... to alter
notes with ﬂuidity,

relatively unknown jazz, talk, and blues

guitarists oi the past.
Kotke's mastery oi the guitar was

especially apparent in a song that comes
lrom a memory oi his childhood. The
memory is that at a public pool where

swimmers could request songs m be
played through an underwater sound
system. Using the slide to add vibrato and
to alter notes with ﬂuidity, Kotke gave the
distinct feeling that all of South Lounge
was underwater, quietly enjoying the
music.

Kotke not only entertained the South
Lounge crowds with his guitar playing.
With a deadpan style like that of comedian
Steve Wright, Kotke told storm that were
strangely funny. Especially funny was his
tale about learning and playing guitar
etudes. ilis complaint oi practicing these
painiul exercises was an experience with
which anyone who had ever taken a music
lesson could easily identify.

Kotke plays music that “makes you
listen with your feetr” There was indeed a
lot oi toe tapping and head bobbing Satur-
day night. it is hard to classily uie type of
guitar music Leo Kotke plays. You can call
it iolk. blues, “contemporary guitar,
stuff," or whatever. None of these existing
styles exactly (its what was heard Satur-
day night. The best was to describe it is
good, damn good. Those oi you who missed
the shows missed an opportunity to see a
truly great virtuoso guitarist on campus.
Those of you who were there know what
great musicianship looks and sounds like.
Take it easy, but take it.
