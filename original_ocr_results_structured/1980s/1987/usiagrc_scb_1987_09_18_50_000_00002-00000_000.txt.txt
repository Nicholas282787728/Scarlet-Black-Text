This year the students are
blessed with two ofllulnallkind’s
greatest inventions, the tele
phone, and the telephone bill.
Many students have misconcep—
tions about how their calls are
billed, due in part to a notice
last year clairnlng that one of
the benefits of the new :ystem
would be that phone rates would
be universal throughout we day.
Theretore, students would not
have to wait until the wee hours
of the night to get atrordable
rates.-

Most important to most stu—
dents are the long distance rates.
What we receive is basically
tirue bought wholesale by the
college from GTE. Thus the
rates we are charged are slightly
less than otherwise obtainable
rates {or interstate calls but can
be slightly more expensive tor
intrastate calls. Shown below
is a schedule of sample calls
to various cities. international
calls currently are not possible

Phone rates cause confusion

SGA briefs:

 

 

partly a product of the breakup
)l‘ ATT), but a special arranger
.uent is currently being ironed
out for our international stu—
dents that should be operational
within a few days. The local sore
vice “fee“ is $15.00 per semester.
One note: ifyou lose your access
number, it can easily be changed
free of charge just by calling the
Physical Plant.

The other question you may
have is what a “ﬂash” is At
the beginning of the year, most
oi us received a brochure in our

mail touting the amazing cape.-
bilities or the new phone system.
The distribution of the brochure
was a mistake. The system does
have these capabilities, but not
for students People with a need
for these conveniences, most no-
tably the faculty and adminis-
tration, have some of these tea
lures. The physical plant said
it was sorry tor all the contusion
that was created,

The entire system, phones,
switches and all cost the college
$340,000.

Bork initiative

set for

by Daniel Schwnrz

Much of this Week's Joint
Board Meeting was taken up
by discussion of the new phone

stem. See your representar
uves’ notes and look elsewhere
in this issue for details. A new
Waltz date (the ﬁrst Saturday
in November) has bc'en selected.
There will be an initiative on
the nomination ofJudge Robert
Bork to the Supreme Court on
Wednesday, Sept. 23, in the
post ofﬁce. The night before,
at 7:30 PM. in south Lounge,
there will be an open iorum to
discuss the nomination.

The Rugby budget was ap»
proved, as were appropriations
tor the Visit by Jennifer Kemp
and for a form letter campaign
, against Judge Bork. Budgets tor

the Bridge Club and birthday

 

celebration fo. the Constitution

Wednesday

were turned down.

The SGA semester budget
was ap,proved with amend
ments transferring $300 from
All Campus Events to the Free
Hand Press and $25 hour the
general fund to the Social Coors
dinator. The increased budget
for Free Hand Press will result
in more copies of the periodical,
and there will be more issues of
it.

one major concern was town
and college relations. There
have been several instances of
college students caught in petty
shoplifting or stealing signs. Ev»
erybody is encouraged to cease
and desist from such activities,
Larry Bush will be on campus
next week to discuss these relae
tious.

cowles diner Melinda Chu de-

way: ”The Loose people were
all sitting at tables by the door.

They all had T-shirts saying it
was the Loose Scope Out. Some
people in Loose asked various
people in line to wear a sign
that said ‘SCOPE ME’ in big
letters. When they got through
the door, they stood on the plat—
form by the stairs, and a Loose
person would point a giant red
paper arrow at them. Three
people would play the Jeopardy
theme on their karoos, and when
the theme ended, ﬁve tables of

Loose people would say ‘HEY!’
and hold up their ratings."

Students were rated by nuxlr
bered placards which the Loose
residents raised in the air. “We
just had numbers that went
from seven to ten. with an ce-
craional one," said Rachel Cash-
man, one of the organizers oftlle
event. Lisa Grant, another orga-
nizer, said, “You could only use
one ifit was somebody you knew
pretty well and wouldn’t be of»
tended. We didn’t want to of.
tend anyone. The point wasn’t
actually to rate anybody."

“We decided that two through
six could be interpreted as of-
fensive. One was so blatantly
bad a rating, it was for friends,"
said Geoff Hoops, also one of
the event‘s organizers. when
asked on what basis people were
scoped, cashman said, “Basie
cally physical appearance, but
there’s no way you can scope
them on any other quality on
such short notice. God, that
sounds awful." *

“You maybe better emphasise
that it all was in fun,” said
Grant. “In no way, shape, or
form are we making tun or the
people we scope. 1 have to ad-
mire the people who consented
to being scoped out."

Among other
things, we’re
especially proud
f our accessorles

, _collection.

Manisll AcliaEyn, all SA in
Loose, explained the Scope Out
further. “The whole thing was
meant to be a protest. [it
was] meant to be a run protest
against what goes on every year
against freshmen. We wanted
to make it very obvious that
this is dumb. We llati mixed
comments [about the scoping].
That's the reason we want to
make clear Loose Hall is mak-
ing fun ofscopiug. we had to be
extremely blatant _by having vole
unteers only wearing signs that
designated them as scopees.

The wearing of signs by the
people who were being scoped
was a modiﬁcation or theorig
inal scope Ont plan. “We were
going to randomly point the are
[OW at people [but] student Al‘-
{airs didn‘t approvc of that,"
said Cuslllnsll. “Student Al‘-
fsirs said if we got permission
from the person, we could go
ahead and scop'e," added Grant.
“That way we couldn‘t offend
anyone."
