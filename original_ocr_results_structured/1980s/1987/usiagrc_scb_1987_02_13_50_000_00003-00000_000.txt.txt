This weekend the Board of Trustees will
convene to decide, among other things,
what to do wiﬂ'i the largest endowment in
the college’s history.

According to Waldo Walker, the
College’s executive vice-president, the size
of the Grinnell College endowment was
calculated at $208,000,000 in June, 1986. To-
day, the figure is undoubtahly higher, said
Walker, due to the current stock»market
rally, The figure indicates the “market
value of the securities in our portfolio plus
the value of whatever real estate the col-
lege owns,” said Walker.

Although the endowment income has
grown dramatically in the last ten years 7
from $1,961,000 to 310,913,000 7 Walker
projects that next year’s endowment in»
come will cover only 32 percent of the col»
lege’s $213,039,000 operating budget.
Revenue from three other sources will
cover the remaining costs, with student»

generated income (tuition, room, board,
and fees) constituting 56 percent of college
revenue. Gifts that do not go into me en»
dowment will constitute 6 percent, and a
miscellaneous category, “other,” will con-
stitute 5 percent.

Only the interest on the endowment,
referred to as endowment income, may be
spent to balance the college budget, The in-
terest helps to pay faculty salaries, food
service costs, and the cost of general
maintenance and major renovation pro-
jects, .

Howard Burkle, professor of Religious
Studies, said that he “would like to see a
fair share” of the endowment income
“spent on educational things as opposed to
bureaucracy.” He added that his “only
concern is the proliferation of offices and
people around here." Anderson agreed
that in some areas such as computer ser-
vices, student affairs, and the library, the

administration has experienced extraorr
dinary growth. However, Anderson added
that growth in these areas “supplements
the academic program.”

Sometimes alumni specify how the in-
come from their gift to the college is to be
spent. The salary of a faculty chair, like
that of the Louise Noun Chair for Women’s
Studies, is paid for with “restricted endow-
ment income,” said Anderson. Walker
said that contributors often designate that
the income be spent on financial aid, in the
form of “endowed scholarships,” such as
the ones for Native American students. L

Walker explained that the majority of
the endowment money is “derived from
gifts, as well as appreciation” of stock and
“potential for appreciation," Robert
Anderson, the college’s treasurer, said
that of the college’s investments, only a
“Small amount lie in real estate that has
been given to the college."

Commenting on the cost of a Grinnell
College education, Walker said, “we rank
very high in how much we spend per stu—
dent.” adding that “$28 million is a gigan~
tic budget.” Walker predicts that “next
year. the dollars spent per student will be
$22,836," Furthermore, he said, “We have
the highest percentage of the budget
devoted to ﬁnancial aid of any of the other
top ten colleges as ranked by U.S. News
and World Report.” Walker added that 21
percent of the overall budget is spent on
financial aid, He said that because the en-
dowment is so large, Grinnell’s tuition is
relatively modest, and the amount of
financial aid awarded to students can re-
maih high. currently, 54 percent of Grin-
nell College students receive financial aid.
