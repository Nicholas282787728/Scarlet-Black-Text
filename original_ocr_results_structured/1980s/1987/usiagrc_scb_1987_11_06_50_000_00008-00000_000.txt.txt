Perlman exercises Romantic ears

by Sam Perlman

Over {all break. aivay irom the
pressures of Grinnell, 1 got a
chance to take a look at what's go
ing on in the world oi contem-
porary opera. what I saw and
heard about was very interesting
indeed

What i saw

What i saw was the Midwest
debut production oi Philip Glass's
"Satyagraha" in Chicago. The sec

Ramones Sober

by Thomas Beverly and
Eric A. Johnson

when the Ramorics burst upon
the music scene in 1976, they were
a loud and fast rockrandrroll hand
without much to say but a good
way oi saying it. Aitci more than a
decade of recording. the Ramones’
iresh. amateurish approach has
soured to still and hall-hearted
reiteration of their previous ideas.
on “Hallway t0 Sanity," their new
album. they still have little to say.
and they have lost every quality
that ever made their music
endearing. The relentless.
danceable beat oi earlier Ramones
has given way to clumsy, plodding
rhythms and somewhat slower
tempos, which emphasize their ob-
vious lack ol enthusiasm. The
sense or humor that previously
justified their shallowness is gone
and leaves only dull_ directlunlessi
recycled rock. Though there are a
couple oi bright spots on “Hallway
to Sanity,” the Ramones have run
their iormula into the ground. so
there is no reason to bother with
this mediocre effort

ERIC: What is surprising about
this album is that is number three
on the college charts. which iust
goes to show that college radio is
just as conservative and tradition»
bound as a top-40 station. Someoiing

listener, in this case. the simplicity
oi the music mirrors the simplicity
oi Gandhi's peaceiul ideas. My
complaint is that when Glass com~
bines his music with solo voices.
the sound is harmonically empty.
especially to Romantic music ears.

What I heard about

what I heard about was the
world premiere oi John Adams’
new opera in Houston. The opera is
titled “Nixon in China” and deals
with the iormer presidents ground
breaking visit to that country in the
early 705. The object oi Adams‘
work was not to give a scathing ex
amination oi Nixon‘srevenlual
downlall. but to express the emo-
tlons oi those who were involved in
this historic event. The leading
characters portrayed include First
Lady Fat Nixon and chairman
Mao,
