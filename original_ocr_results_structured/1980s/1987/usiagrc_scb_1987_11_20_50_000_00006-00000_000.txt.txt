Wait Until Dark

by Bruce Emond

Audrey Hepburn seems the ideal
actress to play victims; her thin,
childlike beauty gives her a par»
ticular vulnerability and ma
genuousness. in ”Wait Until
Dark," Hepburn plays the ultimate
Victim, a blind woman whose hus~
band brings her back a stuiied toy
as a giit, then leaves to go on
business, Unbeknownst to him, the
toy is stuited with a cache oi drugs
which are being pursued by two
drug dealers. They break into the
apartment in search oi the drugs
and then begin sadistically to tor-
ment the woman. Like a cat toying
with a mouse, they play mind
games with her, frightening her,

then lulling her into a temporary
sense oi security, then continuing
the pattern.

The analogy of the Cat and the
mouse is a good one Just like that
situation, with "Walt Unit] Dark"
one is iascinated at first and then a
ieeling oi distaste, even disgust,
takes over. It is a suspenseful film.
but there are so many other more
skilltully made him ithe original
“The Spiral Staircase" readily
comes to mind) which are better
examples oi the genre,

High Noon

by Vincent Prosser

This innovative 1952 movie. star
ring Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges,
and Grinnell dropout Gary Cooper,
is one oi the most celebrated works
oi the western genre The plot pron
bably meant more to contem~
porary audiences due to the
screenwriters intentional use oi
the movie to comment on the air
iccts oi McCarthyism by showing a
man who must stand alone to light
the gunmen that tcrrorize his coin-
munity, while the other local
citizens reiuse to act or to speak
out against the danger.

Gary Cooper won an Oscar ior
his role. as did the "pulsing”
theme tune by Dmitri Tiomkiii.

But it is ior Grace Kelly's lovely
screen presence that many will go
to see the him; her limited acting
range is pericctly suited to playing
Gary Cooper's Quaker bride. Many
people at the time commented on
the doobtiul decency oi pairing an
ancient. wrinkled, leading man
with a youthiul, virginai love-
intcrest. but viewers will have to
judge ior themselves whether or
not the relationship rings with dark
and unwhclesome overtones

A more important role In the
movie is taken by Mexican actress
Katy Jurado. playing Cooper s
ioriner ladyrlriend. hers is an

underrrecognized and moving role.
with more truth and dignity to it
than anything Grace Kelly ever
played. it is all the more
remarkable in that Jurado's perr
iormance emerged irom a super
iiCially-stereotyped role.

See this movie ior Grace Kelly's
beauty. Katy Jurado's dignity.
Gary Cooper's i inkies. the
mustc's "pulsation," and the
theme that emerges oi personal
responsibility and action opposed
to nonrvlolencu and p sivity

Room Service

"Room Service" IS a 1938 Marx
Brothers him. it diiiers irom the
typical Marx brothers movie in
that they are actors in someone
else’s story. The reviewer cone
demned this iilm on the basis that
the Marx Brothers "are constrainr
ed by having to play characters
with a passing resemblance to
human beings."

The storyline revolves around
the wild and nutty antics oi these
comedy kings as Groucho scarns
(with the assistance oi Harpo and
Chico) room and board irom the
jellyﬁsh-sinned hotel manager, As
one could expect, all hell breaks
loose in this Virtual laugh riot
which is highlighted by what is

historically referred to as the
"Turkey Episode " This prolonged
incident caused one reviewer to
warn, .There is a scene in which
a turkey is chased around a room.
Not everyone will care ior this."
Nonetheless. it should also be
noted that this reaction tends to be
the exception rather than the rule.

Time magazine concludes,
”Loyal Marxists will find it well up
to the standard at such
predecessors as “A Night at the
Opera' or “A Day at the Races.’ "
