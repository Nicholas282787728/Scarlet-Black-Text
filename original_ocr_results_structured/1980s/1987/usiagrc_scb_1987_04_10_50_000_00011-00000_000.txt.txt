The Grinnell Griffins Rugby Club began
their spring season with an impressive 2&3
victory over the Graceland Rugby Club
last weekend. The team was in fine form
and scored on two tries early in the game,
setting the quick first-half pace. One more
try and one 227meter kick followed in the
first half, and the team slowed its pace in
the Second half with one try and one
22-meter kick, Line outs and serum downs
were consistently won by the forwards.
and the backs had some quick clean passe
mg.

The team goes to Central College this

' Men Win, Women Second

The Grinnell College men’s and women’s
track teams will part ways this weekend,
as the men travel to Illinois for the Mon-
mouth Relays and the women go to Des
Moines for Drake’s Lady Bulldog Invita-
tional. '

After last weekend's Iowa Wesleyan Ins
vitational against four other schools, the
competition should prove stiffer for both
the men and women this Saturday.

The Monmouth Relays will feature 17
men’s teams, compared to a field of )4 last
year in which Grinnell placed fourth
behind conference rivals Monmouth, Cor-
nell and C08.

While Coach Will Freeman doesn’t View
this meet as a target one, he believes that
the step up in competition should provide
ror some quality .performances by his

Pioneers. .

Freeman also will be using this Weekend
in preparation for the Grinnellrhclsted
State Small College Meet the tollowing
Saturday. “We‘re going to try to move peer
sple around into the events in which we
think they belong," he stated.

The Drake' Invitational will pit some top-
notch talent against the Grlnnell women
tracksters. While most of the schools
represented are Divisions I and 11, there
will also be some Division 111 teams
against which Coach Evelyn Freeman
thinks her team can be competitive.

“We're obviously not looking to score
well as a team," Freeman remarked, ”but
we’re looking forward to taking advantage
of the fine facility, a very well-run meet
and the strong competition." She also

noted that the invitational will provide pro~
bably the only opportunity for freshman
Joanne Sackett in the heptathlon this year.

Last weekend’s invitational in Mt. Plea-
sant couldn't have been .held in a more
appropriately-named town, because both
Coaches Freeman came away “pleasantly
surprised” with the final results oi what
they termed a ”low-key" meet,

The men placed first with 70 poian
ahead of Coe’s 63, followcl by Iowa
Wesleyan with as and Spoon River with 17,
The women were edged by Cornell, 79-75,
for second place. lowa Wesleyan followed
with 45, One 28 and Spoon River 12.

First-place finishers for the Grinnell
men included Mark St. Andre in the high
