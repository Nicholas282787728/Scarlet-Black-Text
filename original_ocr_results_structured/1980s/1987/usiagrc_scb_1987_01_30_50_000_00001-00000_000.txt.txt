Mall shuttle

. sparks debate

by Jennifer Halcrow

Shuttle service to Merle Hay Mall and
the Civic Center in Des Moines begins to
day. This new service has caused some
students to question the goals of the col-
lege, which, in the past, has been
unresponsive to the Women's Group's lob-
bying for shuttle service to women's health
care clinics and gynecologists outside oi
Grinnell.

Leslie Wilson and Trudi Witonsky,
members oi the Women’s Group, are
critical of the shuttle service because their
efforts to set up a shuttle to family plann-
ing clinics and gynecologists omide oi
Grinnell “were met with ambivalence,”
according to witonsky. “I don’t think the
administration perceives a need iior a
women's health care shuttlel,” Witonsky
continued.

Both Witonsky and Wilson cited several
_problems with women's health care in
Grinnell First. all the doctors are males;
and second, they are all general practis
tioners. Another complaint made by
women on campus is that they have poor
rapport with some of the doctors in town.
Wilson also said. “Let's face it, cost [of ex-
ams and birth control] is a factor.” Pro-
viding Grinnell's female students with the
option to see a female doctor. as well as the
option to see a women’s health specialistat
low cost, were the reasons behind organiz-
ing a healthcare shuttle.

Last year, aiter two years oi planning,
Witonsky and wilson developed a question-
naire and mailed It to 330 females on cam-
pusl Wilson said that they used the student
telephone directory as their sampling
irame. selecting every other iemale listed
in the directory. 91 of the 330 questions
naries were returned, which is a response
rate ot 18%, According to Wilson. “I learn-
ed in my stats class that with this type oi
survey. it we achieve 310% response rate,
the results are representative ioi women's
attitudes on Campusl.”

THE CRINNELL

by Kristen Stromberg

The Grinnell 2000 program, which
“seeks to be a catalyst in stimulating pros
jects that improve the well—being oi our
people and economic climate oi our
region," recently approved its goals and
budget for 1987. With almost $23,000 to be
spent on economic and cultural develop-
ment projects this year, the ioundation
will be able to implement plans to better
the quality of life for Grinnell residents.

Arts and recreation programs ioreseen
include the development of an ice rink, a
new design ior Central Park (including a
gazebo), and a loan to a High School night
spot. The Limit.

In the area of economic development,
money was allocated to regional airport
and industry fair projects, to development

The date from the survey are still in
their raw iorm, but the women’s responses
to some of the questions show that 60% of
the women see a doctor at home for
gynecological exams. However, 40% oi the
women who see a doctor at home feel the
need to see someone here or at one of the
nearby clinics for either exams or birth
control. In addition. 68% of the women
preier to see a iemale gynecologist. The
survey also asked. “Would you use a Shut~
tle service to one of the area Iowa clinics if
one were set up on a regular schedule?"
and 29% of the women responded affire
matively,

Donna Bailey. director of health ser»
Vices, said, “As a Woman and a medical
professional, it's difficult (or me to Say
there is a need (or a standing shuttle [to
clinics outside of Grinnell]," Bailey
thought shuttles to the area clinics were
set up approximately four years ago, and
the Health Center notified Women of the
service, The Health Center used to ar-
range ”cluster” appointments for women
at a Des Moines gynecologist, but the ap-
pointments were canceled several weeks
in a row because there was not a great
need expressed by the women on campus.

Bailey added that “in all the time I’ve
been here, there has never been a student
who has been denied transportation on a
medical need by the college." The Health
Center also has a collectscall program set
up with the Marshalltown Planned Paren-
thood clinic, as well as information on
several clinics in the area that specialize
in women's health needs at reduced costs.
Bailey suggested that women who wish to
receive health care outside of Grinnell ar-
range a group appointment and rent a car
[mm the college to get there.

Bailey stressed the fact that there are
doctors in Grinnell and the Health Center
has received “a number of positive come
ments about the doctors here,"

Minority recruiter
f aces challenge

by Jill Petty

Around seventy-five percent of the
blacks who enroll as freshmen at Grinnell
graduate. And according to Steven Jones,
director of Minority Affairs, the rate of
retention is higher for black students than
white students, But this semester, seven
black students transferred or are taking
personal leaves. The number of black
ireshmen in each entering class has
declined over the past iive years. Present»
ly there are fewer than 60 black Americans
on campus, making up 4% oi the student
body, '

As the new Coordinator of Minority
Recruitment, Floyd Akins is responsible
for increasing black enrollment at Grins
nell. li would seem he is righting an uphill
battle. ”The job is a challenge," said
Akiils, “but I enjoy it. l really want to put
Grinnell out in front of black students.”

Akins has set a goal of having 120 black
students on campus “That would be 10%
of the total population," he said. “I dream

big." He said the goal could be made more
achievable if there were “more than 2
black faculty members" and if changes in
the Curriculum were made.

Akins received his degree in Com-
munications and Public Relations from
Eastern lllinois University last year. He
said he did not know much about Grinnell
until Jones, also an EIU graduate, started
working here. “It’s important to let people
know who we are and what we are about.
My job is really a PR job," he said.

A student telethon and increased adver-
tising are two approaches that Akins has
used to increase Grinnell's visibility. Dur-
ing the first two weeks in September, black
high school juniors and seniors were called
by current black students and encouraged
to visit the school and request information.
Akins also started advertising in Eight
Choices, a magazine geared to college-
bound black high school students.

Perhaps, as a result, inquiries from
black students about the college have in»

daycare plans {or both senior citizens and
children.

As a class project, Sociology 341,
“Methods of Empirical Investigation,"
will be carrying out survey research ior
some of the foundation’s programs. The
students’ role is to survey the attitudes of
the townspeople on certain cultural and
economic issues. Questions asked might
concern interest in art exhibits and
musical performances, or needs for
daycare assistance in the community,

“The students are designing the sample,
the survey instruments, and planning for
data analysis," the course instructor, Mr.
McClelland, said. The survey requires
several hundred personal interviews, and
although help is expected irom members

oi Grinnell 2000 and irom other college
students, the class will be doing the bulk of
the work.

“It's an advantageous deal for both
sides; the town gets a good survey, and the
class gets meaningful work, which is
thereiore more interesting and exciting,"
said McClelland. The class report will be
available at the end oi the semester, when
McClelland hopes the data will be substan
tially analyzed.

“In general, Grinnell 2000 will be getting
a bargain in that a lot oi the cost oi the
survey will be borne by the college," he
said. Grinnell 2000 ionds come irom in
dividual duesrpaying memberships, as
well as corporate donations, Although
iinancial partnerships may increase their
revenues by as much as iive or so; times, it

is diiiicult to achieve meaningiul, ongoing
results while Working through volunteer
groups. ‘

The money generated by Grihnell 2000
will be useful as “seed" money to finance
projects, but more ambitious schemes are
needed to iinance agricultural work,
economic development, and health Care
and human service work. Ben Webb, the
foundation’s director, stressed the need for
a fullstime economic developer in
Poweshiek County. A development office
“is exactly what is needed if we are to er,
iectively compete for new jobs in other
cities and counties," he told the Grinnell
Herald-Register, The foundation hopes to
see Grinnell become a community that
reverses population migration and
unemployment iigures.
