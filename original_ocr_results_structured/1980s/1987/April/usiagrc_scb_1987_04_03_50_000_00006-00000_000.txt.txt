Proposal

threatens

Gnnnell ’ s

lity

Like a tornado ripping through a
rmatt Midwestern college compuc, the
Lune of faculty time luu stirred a
rather quiet and rubbed college facul-
ty into violent frenzy action, With
junior faculty members leading the
charge, the Grinnell College faculty has
demanded, nometimer quite forcefully,
that the college administration take tu-
tion on limiting the work load for facul-
ty memben. Citing the pressures of
teaching three courses per semester,
advising .tudentr, serving on commit.
tecr and pursuing academic research,
many faculty members believe that
their work load is too strenuous.

That, in an effort to reduce the work
load of the faculty, the administration
and some faculty member. haoe pro.
posed a reduction of the individual
faculty member‘s teaching load from
six courses per year to five courses, In
fact, this courre reduction proposal hm
gained vuch popularity that depart.
ments have been meeting with presi-
dent Drake and future dean of faculty
Charlie Duke at Drake‘s house to
discu... how the proposal will be int-
plemcnlcd.

These disamsioris have been going on
for the last few ueclrc and will probably
romi revuh in a formal propotal before
the college‘s executive committee. But
before any; formal proposal iv tlruun
up, the college mutt realize that any
reduction in faculty teaching load
without ltiring more faculty will direct.
ly rentlt in a dramatioincrease of
course ltizc. Furthermore; a reduction
in faculty teaching load without more
faculty will rexull in a reduction of the
number of courier offered in oltnott
every department.

In recent nlmillut, the faculty has
been very cecal about its needs for
more time, yet their demands directly
affect the most powerletx group on this
campus 7 the nude-nix. Although it is ill
everytme’s interest to have a faculty
with enough time to do their johr, we
must not overlook tlte effect a teaching
load reduction propottal will have on
the quality ofa (,‘rinncll education. Fif-
ty students in a class and greatly reduc-
ed course offerings will be the direct
result of a reduced teaching load if
more faculty are not hired, In (his the
kind of education Grinnell xhoultl of-
far?

If the college ix veriouc about solving
the faculty tinte problem, they must
hire more faculty, Without quertion, a
failure to hire more faculty while also
reducing faculty teaching load will in-
flict tremendous damage on the quality
ofa crinncll College education. Let ua
not damage Crinriell’tt quality in our
haste to solve one of Grinncll‘s defi<
cient‘ias.

The Human Element

by Jim Duncan
"Go Greyhound, and leave the driving to
us.”
Right.
Riding Greyhound means slow death by
“butt-rot," that numb, gangrenous tingle
in the buns that comes from 36 hours oi
“scenic travel" through Wyoming and
Utah, and parts oi Idaho, Oregon, and
Washington.

Take my advice 7 buy a pla 9. ticket.

For me, riding Greyhound eans that
the linal two hours of the journey are to be
a struggle not to lose my cool with my
”traveling companion" and twist her'head
oil and rollrbounce it down the grime»
layerad ﬂoor of the aisle until it thump-
whumps just enough to land in the knitting
basket ot the snoring, polyesterrdraped old
bat slumped in the sticky, Vinyl-covered
seat at the front behind the driver. I can
just hear her phlegm-tilled screams when
she reaches for her needles.

“I see the bad moon arrisi . .

With greasy hair and a greasy smile I’ll
step oil oi the bus to be greeted by her
parents 7 her father, a fool. shorter, taking
my hand and pumping it vigorously; her
mother wrapping her arms around me

remains of the last meal I had in that
greasy spoon all over the back of this
strange woman...

with the darkness ilying by outside and
lhal. booming metropolis called Boise last
approaching, i he curled up in two very
narrow bus seats wondering it those seedyr
looking Characters in the back rows would
slit my throat ll 1 could sleep. The tips or
their cigarettes glow bright ior briei

seconds then fade back to dull red points.
Occasional harsh laughter lashes out, then
a hacking coulzh from one oi them. Sur~
prise tor them when they riine through my
bags and discover the thing of most valuel
brought along with me, an ancient
Walkman worth maybe $10 now,

The leader, a grizzled, slightly
emaciated mun, leans down over me. The
blood is bubbling from the open wound in
my throat as the ceiling oi the bus spins
round and round, “Where is it? Where’s
your money. you slut?!" He whispers in
my iace, his inilamed nose looming in my
ﬁeld of Vision, its tiny red and blue veins
pulsmg, cocaine-irritated. ismiie broadly
with slimy, redeemed teeth and spit; the
spidery glob slides slowly down his cheek.
He leans Closer; I can Smell his breath
now, garlic and rotted, a closed-in stench
of a grain elevator and dead rats and
dung...

l jerk awake to find that screechyrvoiced
old woman from ﬁve seats up leaning over
in my lace saying, “Getyour legs irom out
oi the aisle, boy. Some people do have to
pee, you know! ” It’s about 3 a.m. lcrlnge
back, scrunching down, trying to get away
from that awful sLench, not certain ol
where I am and what's going on. The
withered lace and blackened gums,
sunken cheeks, thin. glistening tongue
finally draw away so that I can breathe
again I pull up my knees to my chest so
that She can pass. She hobbles toward the
tiny john at the back at the bus with a
smug. sell-satisfied ugliness plastered,
across her aged lace. The most unsavory
characters don't necessarily sit in the

rear, I decide.

. The next day, over twuthirds oi the way
to our destination, 3 kid in the back ot the
bus wearing a Grateiul Dead Trshirt lights
up. We're not even out of the parking lot

' when I smell that sickly sweet odor, about

the same time that the skinny black driver
does. In the mirror, I can see where his
hair is receding and the perspiration is
beading, His face contorts. He jams the
breaks, hissess, and swings up out ol his
seat heading for the rear. “There’s no
smoking oi pot on the bus!” He yells for
awhile and threatens to throw the guy cit it
be lights up again. Five minutes later, as
we head on, the driver comes on the
loudspeaker, “Again, there is no smoking
cl pot on the hus,..,”

During the course of the rest 01 the trip
we’re treated with the pot speech over and
over, The kid in the back keeps laughing,
“yukk. yukk, yukk.” I know that ii I can
hear him laughing, the driver certainly is
able to. He stops the bus again, stands up,
and goes to the back. He draws the service
revolver irom his hip holster, puts the
muzzle t0 the kid’s head, and pulls the (rig-
ger.

The remains are messy. The driver
strolls to the {rent saying, “I like to use
hollow p0inl5...," He sits down and the bus
starts rolling again, Over the loudspeaker,
"Next Stop is Yakima, Washington. For
those of you who got on at our last stop, the
rules of the bus are that there is no smokr
ing oi ptil or any other illegal
Substance.,. ”

Ahh ..riding Greyhound. Lucky me, I’ve
got a round-trip ticket.
