New literary magazine involves more
than just slight of ‘Hand’ 7

by Gwendolyn Skeen

The Free Hand Press. introduced to the
student body last March, evolved irom a
search by Rob Fein and Brian Strause ior
a campus literary magazine. The ex-
islence or only one literary outlet. The
Grinnell Review, distressed these two
ireshmen, due to the cost to students oi the
publication and ini'requency oi its distribu-
tion.

“Literary creation is not a onceaycor
event." says Fein. Also, both student
edit’ors leit that there should be no charge
on a publication made up solcly oi
studenls‘ creative eiiorts.

When the proposal ior Free Hand Press
was presented, the school's iinance come
mittec greeted it with much interest and
support The magazine is currently lunded
by the Finance Committee, as well as the
Student Publication and Radio Committee.

The magazme's editors expressed hope
that they may get increased iunding next
year in order to facilitate artwork within
the publication and to have it typeset.
rather than Xeroxed

Despite their strong opposition to The
Revtew. the purpose oi Free l-land Press is
not to take the place of The Review;
rather. the purpose is to develop an in»
dependent alternative. "This is our baby."
Fein added Rob and Brian consider it to
be "the “Black Box Break' oi literary
work ,.

The majority oi the material received
lor the iirst issue was contributed by
ireshmeii and sophomores. In lact, there
was only one literary work representing
the Junior class, and only three eilorts
were submitted irom the senior class.
Twoslhirds oi the submissions were turned

dowll due to page limitations and
mistakes, such as the excessive use 01
cliches.

Free Hand Press wants students to pre-
sent originality and imagery; nothing
academic. Editing on short stories is for
spelling and basic punctuation only, while
there is no editing on poems

Aspirations [or the future include an
editorial start and staii typists ior increase
cd eiticiency and output. Starting next
year, Fein and Strause hope to get out as
many as tour issues per semester.

The second issuc is expected to be
distributed on April 24, 1987 All Contribu-
tions and comments should be sent to Rob
Fciii by way oi the VAX computer system,
or if lhat is not possible, to box 4778 The
deadline for the last issue of this school
year is next Friday. April 17, 1987.
