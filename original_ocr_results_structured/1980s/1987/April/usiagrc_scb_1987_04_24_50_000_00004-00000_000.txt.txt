Most supporters oi the Sandinistas base
their support upon one or more belieis,
most of which are not founded on fact.
similarly, their opposition to us. support
at the contros is predicated upon certain
assumptions, most oi which are misguided
or simply wrong Once their belieis are
discredited, liberals can resort only to say-
mg. “That's not true," as did a Grinnell
student in objection to a statement about
the Sandinlstas made by Congressman
Mickey Edwards during his recent Visit.
But denying the truth will not change it i
would like to dispel here some liberal illu-
sions about the Sandinistas and the con-
tras. I realize that liberal blatherskites
will probably conjure up a new host oi
Nicaraguan bugbears. but that's not
something about which I can do much. The
facts need to be heard,

One reason that liberals frequently give
in law oi ending US military support to
the contras is that, in fact, the contrns are
composed chiefly of former Somocistas
and can lhus be expected to bring back
another dictatorship (worse than the pre
sent one‘lt if they seize power This belief
is a total iielion. First, the majority of con.
trns are either former Sandlnlstas or, at
the least. opponents oi‘Somoza. None of the
present or iormer leaders oi the contras,
Calero. Rubelo, Cruz, and Chamorro. were
Somocistas. Calero, one of the leaders of
UM (United Nicaraguan Oppositioiil was
jailed under Somoza ior his protests
against that corrupt and brutal regime
atrium cruz is an impeccable democrat:
He served two prison terms under Somoza,
and aligned himself publicly with the San-
diiiistas to help them overthrow Somoza,

Moreover, most oi the small percentage
of the controls who were members of
Somoza's national guard were too young to
have been anything oi signiiicance eight
years ago, when Somoza iell. Besides,
simply being a member oi the military
during Somoza's rule is not an indication of
support. li one had a military career at
that time, he would have been a memberol
the national guard it is also hard to
believe than an army oi over 20,000 could
be raised with promises oi restoring an
almost universally detested regime,
Despite the facts, however, liberals persist
in labeling the contrns Somocistas.

interestingly enough, the ranks oi the
Sandlnistas are filled with Somomstas. In
fact, Nicaraguan ViceaPresident Ramirez
is a former Somocista. A poet, he is well-
known ior his poems oi praise to Somoza
during the latter’s reign. Moreover, in

Another common liberal fiction is that
cilntrn violence accounts for the economic
chaos in Nicaragua. A truer statement
would be that Sandinisia economic policies
account for the economic crisis in
Nicaragua. A December 1931 study by the
International Monetary Fund found that
real wages had declined by seventyone
percent in Nicaragua since July 1979, This

is that a Sandinista noincnklatura, or rul-

"No lessons are so on. ly iorgotten as

words of Mr. Peter Karney. distinguished
Grinnell historian and Relays mogul. when
asked about the origins of the annual event
knolin as the Grinneil Relays.

"The mists at time have Shrouded much
oi the truth about what triggered this
recurring spectacle or degeneracy," said
Karney tersely. "From what scant records
have been preserved, we have deduced
that the idea ripened slowly in the twisted

to coerce several impressionable dupes in-
to staging. under the guise at an athletic
event, a rebellion against conventional
mores. instead of providing the traditional
disinhibitory substances, they audaciously
offered ‘beer for the masses ’

"This revolt might have been ruthlessly
squelched had several members of the ad-
ministrative elite been permitted to act,"
said Mr. Karney. who is also known for his
insightful political commentary. “But the
