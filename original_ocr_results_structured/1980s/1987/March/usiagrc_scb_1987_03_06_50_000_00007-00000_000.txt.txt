Why it had to happen

South African student decries

Botha’s May elect

Dear Editor:

So the 'South African regime has an-
nounced that there will be an election for
the white voters in May. .

When Botha first hinted on an election
last fall he promised far reaching changes
to the apartheid constitution. We were told
that the white voter is going to be asked to
Sanction further reforms.

But since then talk of ‘reform’ has been
more and more muted as the drama of
what Afrikaner politics has unfolded. The
conserative element has forced Botha to
shelve the recommendations of his Presis
dent Council on the repeal or some
discriminatory aspects oi the Groups
Areas Act, He has also forbidden the press.
from publishing anything about the
African National Congress and black ops
position to apartheid. The racist regime's
position on its retorm program has never
been more ambiguous.

The rhetoric train the government has
been that racism and apartheid are being
dismantled. But in the same breath, Both
has indicated that the pillars of the
system, segregated living areas, the
population registration act and the
assumption that the whites know what is
good for blacks. remain inviolable.

It is this studied vagueness that has seen
Botha lose some articulate supporters oi
real reform like the former ambassador to
the UK, Dennis Worral These men have
become irritated by the vague promises oi
reform that do not seem to have any efiect
on the blacks, who remain unimpressed by

ion

the ‘reform’ and continue to rebel and
revolt against the inhuman system.

I do not believe that Botha is about to
lose the election, No black person in his
right senses believes this. The majority oi
white South Africans are fully behind
apartheid oppression and injustice. and
Botha enshrines all these qualities. He
gives the whites a sense oi security that
they do not believe they would get it he
were out oi power. Butha exudes enormous
strength — apartheid strength 7 and this
is the protective umbrella that white South
Africans so desire.

They believe that Botha's ‘preemptive'
raids and destabilization of South Africa's
neighbors protect them from the revolus
tionary violence of the ANC. They believe
that not only has Mr Botha managed to
confine internal violence to the black
townships, but he has also stopped any in-
formation flow about the unrests. They are
convinced that the violence isa black abers
ration that Mr. Botha is doing his best to
cure. I-‘orthe majority of whites South
Africa is a very comiortable country,

The SA government's greatest undoing
is ultimately not that it sanctions the
murder of two year olds, keeps children in
jail or incites brother against brother, but
that it assumes that it knows What is good
for blacks and that it can do things for us.
Our people will once more be looking on
from the sidelines as their fate is being
decided by white South Africa. ~ Thokwa

Uebel’s letter “over-simplified”

Dear Editor:

As one of the organizers of Students
Against the Injustices of Homelessness, I
couldn't help but be incensed by Mark
Uebel’s recent article, which. in my opi-
nion, provided yet another example oi the
petty, personal criticisms that are too ire-
quently aired in the Scarlet and Black.

David Loewenstein's personal posses
sions, or rather those of his family, have
absolutely no bearing on the effectiveness
oi our organization, let alone any signiii-
cant impact on the welfare of “our nation's
people as a whole,“ in tact, using the
same, oversimplified economic analysis
employed by Uebel I could argue that had
the Loewensteins forgone the foreign car
in favor of an American Vehicle of lesser
quality and/or higher price, they’d have
simply subsidized an ineiiicient industry
that lacks in competitiveness. thus
perpetuating that lack oi competitiveness
and its resulting longsterm unemploy-

ment. 7

But that’s not the issue, and shouldn't be
dealt with in the context of the
homelessness crisxs. Davtd simply iden-
tiiied a problem, saw a way we, as
students, could help, and has worked
iastidiously to make it happen. These ac-
cusations oi hypocrisy are pointless and
vicious. They only serve to make a
mockery of the hard work of 40 Grin-
nellians, not to mention the thousands of
Americans giving their time and energy to
support iellow human beings in their quest
for continued existence.

It Mark Uebel is seriously concerned
about unemployment and hypocrisy, I sug-
gest he join our organization and help deal
with the ramifications oi unemployment in
the form of homelessness, rather than
spending his time discrediting those who
are tyring to act constructively. — Laurie

' Uebel apologizes to Loewenstein

Dear Editor:

I owe Dave Loewenstein an apology for
my letter last week regarding the US.
trade deficit and Dave’s alleged contribue
tion thereto. Last Friday afternoon he call»
ed me and told me we needed to get some
facts straight. I met him at the forum and
we talked.

During our discussion i realized my
criticism had been unjustified. Although
nothing I wrote last week was inaccurate,

my letter gave the wrong image of Dave.
More importantly, it turns out I was accus»
ing somebody who, in tact, shares my
viewpoint Dave agrees that the trade
delicit is a grave problem which should be
acknowledged and dealt with.

So thank you, Dave. [or shoving the
criticism aside and seeing the value in the
rest of the argument; let's hope everybody
else does the same. 7 Mark Uebel

In Defense of Draus

Dear Editor.

This letter is in deiense oi Paul Draus,
who. in die February 20 edition oi the
Scarlet and Black, was criticized for his
writing style. Sure, the guy’s sarcastic. I
happen to like uiat. Reading news articles
can become somewhat tedious aiter a
while, which makes a writing style like
praus' a welcome breath oi iresh air. 1
really cannot believe that he is purposeiul—
ly intending to “poke iun and viciously
anger” at those who are the subjects of his
commentaries. His is only one man‘s opi»

nion; others have the ireedom to view
things diiterently and, it they so wish, to
express that view publicly, as Draus does.

Who knows? Maybe I’m just sticking up
ior him because I can relate to a lot oi what
he has to say. Also, I suppose I possess a
tinge oi sarcastic blood in my own veins, I
don‘t even know the guy, but it I did, I’m
sure we would go to the Forum sometime,
have a cup oi coiiee, talk about poverty,
and alterwards go hit a iew weights.

by Susan Simon

You know, life sure does have a way of
playing mean tricks on people.

I got up on Sunday morning and looked
out upon a beautiful sea of whiteness. Big,
ﬂuffy flakes of snow had fallen during the
night, and I ieasted my eyes upon their
beauty. I had decided finally to attend one
of the Unitarian fellowship services, and
as I walked toward Main lounge from
Broad Street, my thoughts revolved
around the beautiiul, sunshiny day, skiing,
and how happy Kathy McCluskey would be
that lowa finally was covered in snow
again so that GORP could make some
more ski outings. I looked forward to being
amongst the very first group to go,
because it's something I'd been wanting to
do for a while.

I thought about Kathy jokingly commens
ting that she was alone in wanting it to
snow again — everyone else seemed happy
to iorego a cold winter and just get on to
spring. I must admit that such a possibility
didn’t sound halfsbad to me, either. But
when I experienced that newly-fallen,
white, glistening snow on a sunny Sunday
morning, all thoughts oi a warm spring
vanished. and I drank in the reality and
beauty of winter.

When I got to iellowship, all I saw were
somber faces, and the atmosphere was
very, very heavy, I thought, “Geezl
What’s the matter with this bunch?
Unitarians are supposed to be lively!"

Well. I iound out soon enough, and tears
came immediately to my eyes I thought,
”No....’l‘his can’t really be happening.
Kathy‘s not dead! Not my very own fun-

loving. caring, iirst aid teacher! "

Ironically enough, the topic discussed on
Sunday was “trust." During the conversa-
tion, destiny and fate were mentioned,
along with “letting go" to life’s forces, and
in whom or in what we really do trust and
have faith. I mentioned that in my own life,
it seems that everything always happens
iora purpose, even it I do notunderstandit
at the time.

Through the course oi the discussion, my
thoughts kept wandering back to Kathy
and due beautiful person that she is. I could
not, and still cannot, understand why this
had to happen. Saying that “such is iate, it
was meant to be” is too easy, too callous,
and too forgiving,

Maybe someday, I hope. it will become
clear to me why this tragedy occurred.
Mike Price irom Computer Services also
met a tragic death in the caves. I don’t
understand why bad things have to happen
to good people, and perhaps I never will.
Maybe that’s Something to contemplate
for next Sunday.

As I walked home atter iellowship,
things had changed. The wind was blow-
ing, the sun was no longer shining. and the
air had turned colder. The town looked
desolate, and I felt depressed. Most strik-
ing, the snow was no longer white. Dirt
flecks were everywhere, and some oi it'
had down-right turned to iiithy mush. .

Change comes quickly, and at times,
tragically. I guess absolutely nothing in
Me is certain, and as human beings, we
are Vulnerable and too weak to have much
of an impact on life’s forces.

Open letter to Drake

This letter was sent to President Drake on
February 27, 1937, and submitted to the
Scarlet and Black by the author

Dear President Drake.

As a black graduating senior, it is my
desire to describe ior you what iour years
at this institution have been like for me.
Unfortunately, 1 reel that my experiences
are not unique to me. I believe that these
experiences happen to many, it not all
students, in some degree or another and to
black students in particular I am utterly
outraged that I must now leave this institus
tion which generated ieelings oi anger,
distrust, cynicism, and lastly disappoint-
ment towards the academia, For these
were not the feelings I brought from my
previous educational experiences or an
tiCipated to have when I left this institu-
tlUI‘l, When I entered Grinnell, I was full of
hope. excitement, and eagerness at being
at an institution which had a reputation as
an outstanding liberal arts college. I
believed that I would leave with a good
education because Grinnell's faculty
would inspire and challenge its students, I
was equally ready and motivated to give
the most of myself I wanted and believed
that I would receive the most from my
Grinnell education,

Instead. I found Grinnell to fall
desperately short on both accounts. Many
or the ideas and thoughts presented by the
iaculty. although I believe they are correct
irom a Eurocentric perspective, gave little
it any credence, attention or mention to
thinkers with diiiering perspectives.
These different perspectives are essential
to me as a supposedly educated black
woman and to other educated students
with a liberal arts background. This letter
is not an indictment of all faculty and
students or even to one iaculty member or
student in particular, but a description of
the limited academic reality at Grinnell
College, Grinnell has not lived up to my ex
pectations and more importantly to its ex-
pectations of creating a liberally educated
student

i believe that inherent in the ideology oi
a liberal arts education is the training of
the mind and the context in which the mind
will work. The liberal arts experience
should train the mind by exposing it to the
differences and'the similarities which ex-
ist in this multifaceted world, be it
physical, mental. political, Social, or

cultural The strength of any institution is
not in its rigidity or strict. unquestionable
adherence to the traditional but to the
cultivation of an educational environment
which allows the mind to be flexible, adaps
table. and unprcjudiced. Grinnell’s
adherence to the traditional, either by
design or deiault, is grossly inadequate ior
a world which is multi-racial, multis
cultural, and multispolitical. I want Grins
nell to present itself as a role model of a
progressive, liberal arts educational in-
stitution. But today, we fall very Short of
my desire Grinnell must ensure that its
iaculty and student body are exposed to
and are diverse in thoughts and ideologies
in all academic disciplines. however dif-
ieiing the viewpoints may be.

Carter G. Woodson, a famous black
historian, wrote in his book The )liseducaa
tion or the Negro:

“If you can control a man's thinking you
do not have to worry about his action.
When you determine what a man shall
think you do not have to concern yourself
about what he will do. It you make a man
feel that he is inferior. you do not have to
convince him to accept an inierior status.
for he will seek it himself. If you make a
man think that he is uniustly
an outcast, you do not have to order him
to the back door. He will go without being
told; and if there is no back door. his very
nature will demand one,"

Thus, in order for Grinnell to achieve its
and somety’s goal of educating people With
the ability to change the world and make it
a better place to live for all humankind. we
must all examine and challenge the
sources of our thoughts We must expand
our sources of thought: after all, change
begins with an Idea, Notonly that. we must
realize that academic racism and sexism
does exist, which is the discrediting oI
scholarship presented by poeple of dif
fci‘ent races, women. and unpopular
belieis. We must reverse this aspect oi
Grinnell tradition immediately, unless we
Want to live in the same must and Sexist

’ tomorrow as .we do today. I
recognize that all vestiges of racism and
sexism exist in all of us, but can be chang-
ed through an eduction iv ch helps one
confront himself or herself. in order to
change the state of this society 7 Yvonne
