College survives

In the ruidst oi the stock
market‘s recent plunge, crinnell
College’s portroiio seems to be
failing better than most.
Griunell‘s endowment stood in
the neighborhood oi $220 mile
lion prior to the market’s drop
in the past two weeks. While
the average portrolio depreciar
tioii due to the crash is probably
in excess or 20%, acting Pres»
ident Waldo Walker said that,
“our losses were considerably
less than the average.“ Due to
the ongoing ﬂuctuation of the
market, Walker was unable to
disclose any estimate oi the col-
lege’s loss in dollar amounts. He
commented that Griunell suf~
tered a “signiﬁcant amount" or

as one or two blacks who deseg—

12714%.

Part of the lesson Grinnell has
weathered the storm as well as it
has is because of the state of the
college's tinances at the time or
the initial crash. “The college‘s
portfolio was in a different po-
sition than most at the Linu‘ of
the initial drop,“ Walker said.
At that moment, Griunell had
a large portion oi its holdings in
cash and tightly secured invest-
merits.

Warren Buffett, a trustee and
a well noted investment expert
who played a major role in
building Grinliell's endowment,
refused to discuss the market's
effect on the college‘s holdings.
He did comment, however, that,
”we’re in very good shape.”

Presidential campaigner
assesses students

by Barbara Brown

“Unless students participate. in
the political process..., students
and young people will never have a
say in the policies that will iollbw
the election." According to Bob
Boorstin, the national campus
coordinator tor the Dukakis ior
President campaign, this is one
reason that college students
receive’ so much attention irom

Presidential candidates.
Eoorslin's job is “to organize col-
lege campuses and young people
not on campuses across the amine
try " This job puts him in a good
position to observe campus
political trends. Buorstin, a
graduate of the Harvard JFK
School of Government and former
reporter for the New York Times,

discussed his opinions oi student
political activity in a telephone in-

According to Bocrstm. another
reason candidates direct their etc
