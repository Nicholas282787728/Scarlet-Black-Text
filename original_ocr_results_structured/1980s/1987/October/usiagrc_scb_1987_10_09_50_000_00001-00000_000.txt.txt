ARHrenovation RaSh Of ihGﬁS

still on hold

Student building making

progress

by Jonathon Andreas

In May at 1989, the renovation of
the ARH will begin At this point,
little is certain about what the
renovation will entail. The trustees
have decided that the total cost will
be between as million and 4.4
million dollars. which includes
every charge troni labor to the cost
at the trashcans The architect,
Ben Weese. will draw up the plans
between December i and
February 12. Until then, nothing is
certain as to hoiv the interior oi the
building will change.

Every department has its
wishes and it all at them were to
be met, three ARl-ls would pres
bably need to be built. Time is
needed to hammer out come
promises between the various lace
tiuns This hammering will take a
huge amount oi time, especially
considering all or the people in
volved.

Cathy Baldwin. the leader oi the
student building committee, said
that although it may appear that
there is no progress, a lot oiwork is
getting done. However, the process
takes a great deal ot time to ensure
that the results will be satistac-
tory

The renovation will split up the
auditorium into two lloors. On one
oi the tloors, a new improved
audiovisual center will reside. On
the other tloor oi the split
auditorium will probably be a
smaller auditorium with the
capacity for at least 200 people.
The classrooms will probably be
carpeted. and every room will
have the capacity to use computers
or AV equipment.

The look at the building's ex.
terior will be preserved as will the
unusual brickrlined hall tloors.

An elevator will be installed. and
one possibility is to put it between
ARH and Carnegie and to connect
each floor in the two buildings with
halls which would give handicap-
ped people access to all at both
buildings.

Many other possibilities also are
being considered. A iourth tloor
may even be added to Mill. This
floor could be added without its be

ing visible irom the outside.

Thursday, October 1, the
building committee met with an
architectural consultant Concern»

this point. it is planned to be
located at lhe east end of Cowles. It

science at the University of illinois

campus this week in conjunction
with Grinnell's Black Awareness
Week She is a wellnoted scholar
whose major areas or locus are
American politics, interest groups,
urban politics. and racial and
ethnic politics During her stay,
Dr. Flnderhughes was interviewed
by the Scarlet and Black concern
ing issues surrounding her
specialities.

How powerful are lobbyists at
the national as well as local level‘7

Dr. Pinderliughcs

Al. the national level, If you
believe President Reagan or Orrin
Hatch, they arc extremely power
lul I think that the lobbies are im-
portant because they play an im-
portant function in shaping issues
by generating support from their
constituencies ndconveyingsome
at that inform' 'on to members of
Congress. without those special

groups. it would be hard to take a
random sample ot the environment
and make sense out at what that
sample meant

Scarlet and Black

There is otten discussion about
the uniqueness of Chicago politics.
is there a big ditterence between
how politics in Chicago is shaped
compared with the other major
cities?

DI'. Piiitlei-liiiglics

Yes there is, because Chicago
has always had a larger number or
racial and ethnic groups than
many other cities. Those groups
have interacted with the govern-
ment on the basis oi their group
identity. I think that's a distinctive
form you won't lind in other cities.
Harold Washington's campaign
was. of course based on a group ape
pea] to blacks as a whole. St) I do
think Chicago's quite different,
The political structure explains
part or the ditterence and also
something about the political
culture which iias generated a
strong interest in group and the
