decline in attendance. Although
the freshman run is still large, ac-
cording to Hansen, general
bakeryrrun size has shrunk con
siderably. Hansen comments on
the cause of the decline: “1 don't
know 7 lt'S just the kids. They've
changed. in the 705 they were into
the reverse liiestyle. Now they‘re
more clean-cut." Hansen sym-
pathizes with those who would
rather come in during the day, He
said, “It i could sleep at night. l
would." Hansen enjoys the tradi-
tion. He said, “It's kind of fun it a

 

person always comes in the back.
You get to know their face. Then
six years later they come back and
they still come in the back door."

Overall business has suffered a
slump as well. After he took over
the business in 1976, Hansen had
two college students working ior
him Then. Hansen explained.
“busmess got so slow i iigured I
could do it myself." Apparently,
the advent oi bakery sections in
grocery stores has contributed to
the decline in business. Hansen
said, “Sometimes there's too much
work for me. and sometimes
there's not enough,”

translation.

Trotter's research interestssuit
him well to his course load. Topics
on which he has done research in
clude Russian intellectual history
and religious thought, theoretical
linguistics. and the 19thrcentury
Russian realist novel. What, one
might ask, is a 19th-century Rus
sian realist novel? “They're novels
written mostly between 1850 and
1900. and other than that, they're
very hard to explain," Trotter
said. His dissertatio , which he
hopes to iinish within the next two
years. is on aphoristic discourse in
Russian realist novels.

Trotter said that one at his hob,
bies, If it could be termed that, is
reading. Modern Japanese
literature provides a break irom
Russian realism "Not. that l've
gotten very far with it. It interests
me is all. I notice books by current
Japanese authors when l’m in the
bookstore."

He also notices baseball pen
nants, and ﬁnds that Grinnell is a
welcome change for him, “I've
never lived in a small town before,
and i rather enjoy it The people
are friendlier. than I'm used to, the
air is good, it's peaceiul, l enyoy
the atmosphere where students
and iacuity are so dedicated to
their studies as well. I'm very im»
pressed with the college."

Hansen cited the drawbacks ol
his business: “It cuts back on your
social liie, Sometimes you have
long days." But, ior Hansen, the
positive aspects of his business far
outweigh the drawbacks, He said,
“i enjoy the work. Sometimes you
get ieeling down when something
breaks down. If anything big
broke, I don‘t know what we’d do.
But we just go along irom day to

parents were very encouraging

“The Russian Department at
Grinnell is a good place to be now,"
Wolf said. “I absolutely love

The photography staff [including
the photo editor) was not consulted
concerning the choices oi pictures
used in the book. We were isolated
irom the layout stall and had
separate meetings. We\ were

Vious that the editors were not, and
in the end it reﬂects badly on all of

believes he is “doing something in

Fitzgerald was also attracted to
