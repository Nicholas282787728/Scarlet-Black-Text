Purple 'Rocs

Hop Ahead

by Grant Ehrlich

Last Saturday, after a hard week
of relentless training and a three
hour ride in Grinnell College vans,
the men's cross-country teams
won the Southern Division cham-
piunships hosted by Knox College
in Galﬁburg, Illinois. Leading the
purple Roos through this lowrkey
meet were co—captain Greg “The
Missing Link" Evans and the high-
fashion ireshman, David Ham-
mond. Evans broke the tape alter
23 minutes and 24 seconds on the
iour-and-onehall mile course;
Hammond ﬁnished fifth. After 20
seconds in came Grinnell's pack
through the finish. Leading the unit
of six Grinnell runners was Mark
“Household" Couch, who ended in
10th place, and Mike Jennings, who
finished 11th, Ivan Lorkovic. Sweet
steve Piper, and Todd Rowekamp
placed 13th, 14th, and 15th, respec-
tively.

The size of the pack emphasized
the most unique feature of this
year’s team: its size. The team is
34 runners strong even though only
ﬁve of those score. Seven runners
must be designated as possible
scorers. and which seven will be
designan from this massive team
is the tough decision that Coach
Freeman must make each week,
although he does have the aid of his
son, Cameron. Because the team
has such depth, Coach Freeman
commented. a top runner may not
run, yet the team will still perform
well.

The first peak event for the team
will be tomorrow morning, Satur-
day, right here in Grinnell, when
we host the Les Duke Invitational.
Les Duke is a regionally recogniz-
ed meet held each season featuring
one oi the toughest courses in the
Midwest. Grinnell has not won this
race tor a couple of decades, but it
has not fielded a team of this
caliber for over 20 years, The team
to beat will be nationally recogniz-
ed Simpson. If Grlnnell's tront run-
ners, Evans and Hammond, can
stick to Simpson’s front pair, and if
our pack can engulf Simpson's
third through fiith runners and
Wartburg's designated live, the
meet should be ours

Packing is very important, since
runners can run much faster when

This weekend, the Lady Pioneer
crossscountry team hosts the Les
Duke Invitational and hopes to
keep the tire that pushed the runs
ners into a second~plaCe finish last
weekend at Knox College.
Although running without junior
Blair Davison, who has a possible
stress lracture in her knee, the
lady harriers were able to
‘ establish themselves among the
,conlerence elite. Paced by senior
Dorothy Shearn's tourthplace
finish, the women's team also plac-
ed Katherine Fairbanks (5th) and
Adrianne Clark (7th) in the top 10.

 

Coach Evelyn Freeman Credlls
the team's latest success to the
{act that the women stayed "pack-
ed together" and did not run as in
dividuals as they had the week
before. She also said that the team
ran much more aggressively than
in the previous meet and therefore
were able to stay close to the
leaders throughout the whole racc.
Although the women ran much bet
ter. with general allraround im-
provement, Coach Freeman said
that the team can still run better,

Now that the college lootball
season has begun in earnest, the
sports pages across the country
will be bursting with stories about
Oklahoma, lowa, Nebraska, Penn
State, et al, The only sports page
Grinnell will stun is the Scarlet
and Black. The reason tor this is
explained by the dilterences of the
divisions in college lootball.
Oklahoma and company are Divi-
sion I iootball teams, Grinnell,
Knox, and Coe are Division in
tootball teams. The difference bet-
ween Division 1 athletics and Divi-
sion lll athletics is scholarships.
Division 1 teams, with their enorr
mous athletic budgets, otter
scholarships to their players. Divi-
sion Ill teams cannot oiier scholar-
ships: other comparisons can be
made between Division 1 lootball
and Division 111 lootball.

nlinois has problems recruiting
athletes who can score over a 700
combined on the SAT.

Grinnell will only accept athletes
who scored over 700 on the Verbal.

Oklahoma is ranked number one

by UPI.

Grinnell is ranked ninth by US.

in a pack, but a pack is hard to hold *
together, The strategy oi the pack

is patterned after the evolutionary
process of phagocytosls, in which
the desired body is surrounded and
destroyed by the larger unit. Thus,
the key to this Saturday‘s race will
be the Roos’ large pack of runners,
The race will run throughout the
goll course and athletic lields near
the observatory, the start and
iinish will be on the righthand fair-
way. The men will start their ex-
travaganza at “:45 AM. after the
Women's 11 AiM. race. Be there.
