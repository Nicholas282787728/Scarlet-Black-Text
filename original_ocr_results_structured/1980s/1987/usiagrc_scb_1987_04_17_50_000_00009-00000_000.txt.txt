GCGC film--

Streamers

by R.J Baker

Originally a prize-winning play by David
Rabe, "Streamers" is noiv a mayor motion
picture directed by Robert Altman. whose
"Nashville" and "Come Back to the Five
and Dime. Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean,"
are other examples of his movteswith gay
or lesbian subplots. The plot tells of tour
men in an army barracks waiting to be
sent to Vlet‘Nam, Drafted and enlisted,
black and vilnte, gay and straight, middle
class and “street" are several of the divir
sions that emerge in this very powerful
film The movie focuses entirely on the one
location oi the barracks. including the
lockers, bathroom and showers, and the
bed. yet it is last-paced The name of the
trim comes both a story made into a song
sung by the two drunken, “experienced"
Colonels. survivors (it the Korean War,

“Streamers" makes no attempt to avoid
racism or homophobia. blatant or covert
The tilm follows how the men react and
change under the stress ol war. Apr
propriately co-sponsored by GCGC, Men‘s
GI'OHD. and SCA this film confronts the

gay undertones in an allrmale situation. it
challenges the stereotypes oi gays as pari~
sies, of homosexuality being a “white
disease," and oi gays belonging to a single
class. Without any glorification of the
situation. "Streamers" presents the war
as being iought by both black and white
Americans and It deals with the soldiers'
tension. anger. and irustration.

I think that this iS a meme Wallace Terry
should have mentioned. iliope that people
will be interested in having a discussion
after the showings of this film
"Streamers" is a great ﬁlm, a powerful.
very moving and also disturbing film, For
some reason tperliaps racism,

film is not available on the standard reel so
it must be shown on a very expensive

Step in time
with Symphony Ensemble

by Julie Schutz

It's that time oi year again: strawberr
rles. diln lights. and the strains of the Blue
Danube tloaling through Darby or all
campus events, the waltzes are the best at-
tended, Almost everyone on campus goes,
except tor a few who do not like crowded
rooms and lots oi people As for the rest,
they Come tor many reasons: because it is
"diilerent," not a standard weekend beer
bash; or to wear their fancy clothes they
bought for the prom and thought they
would never use again; or to observe, to
see people who “always" wear blue jeans
turned into Southern belles and suave, tux-
edoed gentlemen One junior called the
waltz " e only civilized social event on
campus Some people even come because
it is a rare chance to do something they
really enjoy doing — waltzingl

This year's spring waltz will be held in
Darby Gymnasium on Saturday, April 18,
starting at 9:00 p in, Last semester's waltz
was held in Quad dining hall as a last
resort since a basketball game was
scheduled for Darby. The waltz organizer,
Thom Barthelmess. said that Quad
presented many problems Not only is it
tot) small, but it costs more. Because it had
to be used to serve breaktast the morning
alter, nighttime cleanup crews irom the
physical plant had to be hired Students
also complained about the acoustics in
Quad

Grinnellians have often used the waltz as
a forum to express their individuality This
reporter has seen, mixed in Wltl‘l gorgeous
hoop skirts. Hawaiian shirts, men in drag,

men in grass skirts, and even streakers
Mops and brooms have appeared dancing
with oddly dressed people. One year a
huge rubber tire was brought in and a
group oi people gathered inside it moved
vaguely to the oomrpah-pah oi the or:
cheslrzl Fortunately, the students involv~
cd realized that they were knocking people
over in their zeal. and stopped

Being knocked over or otherwise bruised
is a common memory oi many waltz
veterans Fewer bumps will occur it
everyone follows a few basic rules of
ballroom etiquette. Most basic is that the
general flow of traffic IS counterclockwise.
Obviously, it one couple tries to go against
the (low or to cut straight across the floor.
colliSlons will occur The most Important
rule on a crowded dance floor is that
anyone who is dancing slowly or staying in
one place should stay in the middle oi the
iloor, leaving the outside edges to ex
perienced and fast-travelling dancers. In
general, couples spin clockwise, especially
on a crowded floor.

An addition this year to the waltz is a
theme. “Gone With the Wind." As reported
in last week‘s SGA notes. some people are
concerned with possible racism inherent in
that theme. but it was meant more as a
humorous addition to the waltz than a
serious label. According to Barthelmess,
”The theme is very tonguerinrcheek. It fits
in well with the romance of the waltz. lean
see that people could be oiiended by it, but
I really don't think people would complain
it they brought the movie to campus,”
