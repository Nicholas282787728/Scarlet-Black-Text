“Can’t we share in the good fortune

Dear Editor,

The list of things that Grinnell can't af-
lord to buy for the students 15 long. We
can't afford health care. we can't afford
TV antennas that get channel 17 (that's
Star Trektl. we can't afford to pay
students more than $3.65 per hour, and now
we can‘t afford to build the proposed new
"student use" building. Already the ad-
ministration is saying things like "con-
crete reality of costs," and “maybe we can
get by without one,”

During the renovation of Mears, did
anyone say anything about “concrete
reality of costs”? Did anyone suggest that
"maybe we can get by without it"? Oh-
viously the administration spent all the
money on offices, and doesn’t have any lett
over for us.

This might cause some students to cone
Clude that the administration doesn't care
too much about us, and cause all sorts of
bad feelings. But I have a plan that will
take care of this problem quickly and easls
ly. It might hurt the trustees leelingsa bit,
but I'm sure they \vll] understand The
plan is simple: get more money,

Check my arithmetic: this year we got
$11 million in interest from the endows
ment The endowment is worth $200
million The interest rate: 5': percent
LFive and a half percent of $100 million is
$5.5 million. times 2 is $11 million.) That's
kind or low. considering the minimum
balance we can maintain. In tact, my
checking account from back home gets 6' i
percent. The dirterence. iv ol a percent.
multiplied by $200 million, is $l.5 millloll.
That should be enough for this new
building, and still have enough left over to

Y1!

\

buy a decent UHF antenna.

But there are other advantages: if we in-

vest in a checking account in ldaho Falls,
ldaho, we certainly have divested from
South Africa. Unless someone has a moral
thing against potato farmers, we can col-
feet the cash and still feel good about
ourselves.

If we were shrewd investors. we could

probably get better than an percent, We
could make managing the endowment a
senior seminar for econ. majors. What's
the interest on T-bills? Seven and a half
percento That's st million a year. almost
more than I know what to do with, If Mr.
Reid is as aggressive with the stock
market as he is with freshmen in Intro,
Econ. we could really kick some butt Im~
again _
would cover the entire operating budget
for Grinnelll We could charge. say, $5,000
or so tuition. just so we can keep increas
ing the endowment. The place would be a
major bargain, so we could attract the
highest SAT scores in the nation. and
maybe some students too Financial aid
would be no sweat, since we wouldn't acA
tually need the money in the first place.

if we could get 14 percent. That

I hate to take the trustees' job away

from them. They seem to have such a good
time playing with the endowment But this
is business, This place is boring enough as
it is, The Pub is gone, and ARH is soon to

follow Is a building for student use so
much to ask? Grinnell is rolling In money
Can't we share in the good fortune of the
College? 7 John Nuleuiy

student Offers constructive criticism

on social activism

Dear Edito

last week's 5&3 ran a personal accus-
ing David Loewcnstcin of hypocrisy ror
helping Des Moines' homeless. while at the
same time driving a Iol‘eign-bullt car, thus
contributing to the unemployment pro-
blem in the Us I hope Dave. rather than
taking offense at the message. considers it
a bit of constructive criticism While
Dave's etiorts in the Des Moines project
were somewhat bellitled in lhepersonal. I
was pleased to find that somebody else is
concerned about the incredible trade
deficil and its unpredictable ramificas
tions.

Buying imported rather than domestic
products is detrimental for obvious
unemployment reasons. Buying products
made by "foreign" companies in the us.
(for example. at Mazda's Flat Rock.
Michigan plantor Honda's plant in ohiot is
less harmful by far. but still presents some
problems Employment increases in these
regions. but many of the parts from which
the cars are built are still imported,

The trade deficit has already driven the
iederal government to take measures to
lower the dollar's international value.
making us, goods more attractive
worldwide, The dollar's continuous

plunge. however. worries some people who
believe that foreign investors will
withdraw their investments in the U.S .in-
vestments which now help finance public
and private operations in the U.S. There is
also speculation that trade problems cons ~
tribute to the budget deficit plaguing our
iedcral government when income of us
businesses decreases, so do tax collec-
tions. Sure. government overspending
must he brought to a halt, too, but you pear
ple who insist on purchasing imported pro
ducts are certainly doing nothing to
alleviate this problem.

As regards most products. little or no
sacriiicc is made in buying a us -built
product rather than an imported one, ill I
need to defend that statement, I will let 0p~
posmg views be voiced first and follow
them will a future editorial, It is an eX'
ncmelj controversial topic that need not
be sol To conclude. such "sacrifices" are
dwaried by potential iuture ones.

Dave. lam sorry you had to be the target
of this attack. because you helped people
in other ways, But it you give a damn
ubout the demlse of the homeless in Des
mines. how about showing that you give a
damn about our nation's people as a
whole? —- Miii'k Echo!

Colfax woman concerned by military

influence on children

Dear Editor:

We are recently subjected to an ex-
tremely frightening and ugly spectacle on
the evening TV News, when camouflaged
soldiers descended on a school ground in a
Military Helicopter and charged into the
school auditorium filled with unsuspecting
students, The soldiers raised and fired
their guns. explaining later that the guns
were real, although this ammunition was
not, The soldiers shouted fiery and
threatening speeches and then lett.

What is the underlying signiticance ofall
of thisY'It is deeply troubling and could be
part ol a larger plan to have the military
further influence our chlldrens' minds.
Surely, love of country is not taught by

subjecting children to Terrorist-type
raids! is it any wonder that our chidlren
are losing their hope for the future and
respect for their country. when "the
powers that be" show no respect for their
innermost feelings?

Perhaps those students now have a bet
ter understanding of the dreadful fear that
grips the hearts of Nicaraguans at the
sight of Military Helicopters, carrying
their deadly cargoesl

There can be no hope for Peace in the
world, if our youth are indoctrinated into a
military mindset and false patriotism.
Those are the tactics of the Nazis! i

Unstrung Knees

by Barbara Brown

I have to hand it to George Drake. He
sure is a crafty fellow,

Last week. George sent home to our
parents copies of the letter we all received
in our mail boxes You know the one — the
“fee-hike" letter, it is part of George‘s job
to send out one of these letters every year,
And every year. it isthc job of students
and parents to become unjustlfiably irate
when they see the increase in tuition and
fees which the letter announces

it has long been George's dream to send
out one of these necessary annual letters,
and. somehow, have its unpleasant con-
tents disregarded by its recipients. As the
saying goes. “Practice makes periect "
After several years of concerted effort.
George finally has written such a letter
The magic element of this letter is called
the “grammatically incorrect sentence."
He uses this secret weapon just enough to
be effective, not ostentatious I have to ad-
mit. I was snookered by George's
cleverness.

My blood first started to boil when I read
in George‘s letter that "the comprehensive
tee at Grinnell pay for about so 9 percent of
the annual cost of education My dander
and hackles Simultaneously were raised
when I encountered this next sentence:
"Faculty salaries nationally are not ade-
quate. especially when one considers the
high quality and intensive education that
distinguishes excellent teachers " I was
appalled that the president of our college.
a highly educated man. could accomplish
no better subject-verb agreement than he
did in these sentences. Further. I was ems
barrassed to know that this letter was sent
home to all of our parents’ what are our
parents to think about the quality of Gl‘ll’l'
hell's faculty. the president of which has
trouble producing a coherent sentence in
his native tongue? What irked me about
the letter was not the announcement of an

increase in tuition. but the flagrant but-
chering of the English language used to ex-
plain the increase George's ruse had
worked: my altention had been diverted
completely.

My father. too. was taken In by this
clever hoax. When Dad mentioned the let»
tcr. it was not to commengabout the in
creased costs. but to say that he had cor»
rectcd the letter and sen| it back to me, He
left it to my discretion whether to deliver
the corrected version to George Drake.

"Come. come." some of you are saying
in your youthful naivete, "everyonemnkes
mistakes Our president would not
deliberately dupe us like this."

This thought has crossed my mind. but I
just cannot accept it. These grammatical
errors are not “mistakes”: rather, they
are deliberate diverslonary tactics
employed by George Drake to direct our
attention away from the tuition increase
My reasoning is simple First of all,
George Drake is the president of our col
lege. No president receives his position for
his ability to make mistakes whlch will
emmbarrass the body that he represents.
Consider Ronald Reagan, Also. George is a
Rhodes scholar: no Rhodes scholar should
have trouble with subject-verb agreement.
Many a tourthgrader has mastered this
simple concept. And. as a member til the
Gl‘lnnell College community, George has
free access to the Writing Lab. Heck. I bet
he can just walk in any time he wants and
have his letters proofread for mistakes It
is for these reasons that I dismiss the no-
tion that the grammatical errors in George
Drake's letter were just "mlstakes." I can
conclude only that they were made
deliberately in order to distract our atten-
tion from the news of the annual increase
in tuition.

Congratulations.
masterful plan
cessful.

George. on your
