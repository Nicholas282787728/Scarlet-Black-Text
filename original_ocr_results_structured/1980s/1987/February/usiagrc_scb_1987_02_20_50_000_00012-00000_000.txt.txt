Trustee appointedtto
investment firm

Courtesy of Public Relations

Grinnell College honors-graduate and
trustee John R. Price, Jr.. formerly senior
vice-praident and corporate secretary of
Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, has
been appointed managing director or
Manufacturers Hanover’s investment
banking unit.

The Wall Street Journal cited Price as
one of the first businessmen to recognize
the profit potential in President Reagan's
plans (announced last spring) to raise
revenue by selling government loans to
private investors. As a result of Price’s ac-
tions, the Farmers Home Administrations'
Rural Development insurance Fund
selected Manulacturers Hanover from
among 33 bidders to advise it about

packaging and selling the program’s ilrst
series cl more than $1 billion in loans.

The assignment is expected to earn the
banking company a tee of nearly $1
million,

Price, a ltyear veteran or the nation’s
fourth-largest banking company, has serv-
ed in a variety of positions; he has worked
in government relations and as overseer of
the company's non~bank activities. Prior
to joining Manuiaoturers Hanover, he was
a special assistant to President Nixon for
urban and rural affairs.

A former Rhodes scholar, Price
describes himself as a “hybrid” who grew
up in New York suburb and on his lamily's
200»acre farm in Charlton, IA. He says his
new post “is a natural outgrowth of
everything I've been doing for 20 years.”

taken them everywhere, from Such small
jungle towns as this, to coastal resort cities
such as Santa Marta; to even the capital,
Bogota. Then the name San Agustin drop-
ped into place somewhere along the way,
and Susan knew. Call it the sixth sense or
woman's intuition, but she knew this was
to be the place where she would [ind her
husband,

In the morning, she asked the hotel clerk
at the front desk it there was someone in
town who could tell her it Will had been
seen. She showed him the photoi He shrug-
ged his Shoulders and turned back to the
snowy black and white show on TV.

They went to town. All morning, she and
Dave walked around talking to people at
the outdoor market, showing Will's picture
to people and receiving only sympathetic
head shakes, uninterested no's, or c0m~
plete silence. Many ignored them, others
tried to push their goods, lrorn papayas to
leather boots with pointy toes. One mere

he tried to sell her a shrunken head.
”Senorita! Comprelo.‘ Es muy raro!"

Dave became disgusted and pulled her
away,

The wizened little merchant left his stall
a few minutes later and waving his arms,
ran after them until he had caught up.
The man who would know, he said, lived up
in the mountains northwest a few hours
ride away, Then, seeing a street urchin
snatch something from his table of wares.
he ran after the small boy before Susan
could thank him.

They hired a guide who lived on the edge
or town, one recommended to them by a
new clerk at the hotel. They rented horses
and packed some equipment, then the par-
ty of three struck out, After an hour of
climbing on a steep, rocky trail, they
rested the horses and had a bite to eat.
Dave was saddle-sore and irritable. Susan
was eager and driven by an overwhelming
sense oi anticipation They mounted up
again when lunch was finished, The ride
continued, as will this tale next week.
