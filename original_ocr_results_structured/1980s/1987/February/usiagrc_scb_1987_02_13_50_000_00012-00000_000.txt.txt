is still pondering that one. . . .
won only a few seconds remaining in
overtime and our team holding on to a two
point lead, the ceiling collapsed on the
Pioneers. Daryl Scott muscled down a key
rebound and quickly threw it up court to
Chapko. Catching it in lull stride in front of
two defenders, Capko tried to relay the

pass to Whitaker so as to avoid a ioul,
which would have stopped the clock.

Things, unfortunately, do not always go as
planned.

Not having enough momentum behind
the ball as he was still suspended in mid-
air, Chapko’s pass went awry and was in-
tercepted near halfcourt. An LC. guard _
who had not hit a long jumper all night —
must have been a religious fanatic because
his 3-point prayer was answered. Describ-
ing the “freak” ending, Coach Smith said.
“It distracted from a marvelous evening
of basketball."

Maybe it was the overtime loss. or the
fact they played in fewer than 24 hours.
Whatever the cause, the effect was clear e
Grinnell lost another conference game

Saturday afternoon to Knox. 91-82. Chdnko
attributed the defeat to the adverse Cir-

(-umstances; he said, “Friday’s unfor-

 

 

tunate loss was a tough, emotional defeat
which caused us to come out flat on Satur-
day.” Knox did indeed deflate Grinnell,
burning the Pioneers with pinpoint Outside
shooting, much of it coming from senior
phenomenon Marc Thomas, who leads the
conference in scoring. ‘

The diagnosis from coach Smith was
straightforward and simple: they did not
shoot well as a team. Chapko had 35 (9 of 17
from 3), Whitaker 25 (4 of 10 from 3), and
Scott poured in 12, accounting for 72 of 82
points scored — not exactly balanced.
Nevertheless, Smith was pleased with the
overall performance: “Coming off that
heartbreaking loss, I didn't know how the
players would react. But all in all 1 have to
commend them for their strong effort.”

The Pioneers will get' a chance to

reiterate their home court dominance
tonight, as they take on rival Coe. Coe 7
tied for second in the southern division ~
is one of me biggest and most physical
teams Grinnell will face. To combat this
bulk, Smith plans on playing a full—court,
up-tempo game, keeping Lheppponents off
balance. Preaching some Words of motivar
tion, Smith stated, “I told the fellows that
it’s tradition not to lose to (Ice here on Fri»
day night.” Oh, no. not tradition.

Board will be sponsoring a iood drive to
benefit the Poweshiek County Food Bank.

day, February 15 until Saturday, February
Zl. All members of the college community

fruit, Deposit boxes Will be avallable on

be able to donate cash on these days.

were other stores that had to close. I don't
really think it’s hurt my buslness — every
month my business has gone up 7 but it's
bound to hurt somebody."

WalrMart manager Goldammer resents
the store’s image as a privileged outsider.
“We are a part of the community; all the
stores give a $1000 scholarship. We take
care of United Way, and we‘re working on
Special Olympics and the March oi Dimes
for muscular dystrophy. We're here to
give, also. We want to be a part of the com-
munity,” he said,

Nadine Runyan, manager of John's
Hardware downtown. agrees with Mr.
Goldammer, saying, “They bring people
from outside Grinnell into town to shop.
Our business has increased since Walr
Mart's come to town. Wal-Mart is a plus
for Grinnell. They’re an asset to the com-
munity,”

Harold Hanson from the Ben Franklin is
not so sure. He agreed with Mrs. Ham-
mond by saying that Wal-Mart should not
have been “given any unfair advantages
such as lndustrial bonds.” But is a Walr
Mart good or bad for a small town? “Only
God Almighty knows the answer," he said.
“And I certainly don’t know the answer."

The film continues to paint an absurd
view of the selfcentered attitude of the
American public. Perhaps we are being
led to believe that a society that embraces
the likes of Pee Wee Herman as socially
redeeming should be given a mass
lobotomy. Nevertheless, Peter Seller’s
role as Chance is his most entertaining
performance, leaving the PINK PAN—
THER series chasing its tale and the au-
dience‘begging for more.

The symposium last week reminded us
of the extend of poverty in this abundant
country. This problem also exists not only
in largecities and remote regions but also
in our own backyard. Poweshiek County
has a population or only 19,000 pesons; yet
last year alone the Food Bank received re:
quest for and supplied citizens with 2,000
four-day units of food, Unfortunately this
statistic understates the amplitude of
poverty in our county because those who
require assistance from the Food Bank are
generally those who do not qualify for
federal aid. ' V

money.” Drake emphasized that it is
“unlikey a decision will be made at the
February meeting," and said that he could
not guarantee that if the iacility were built
it ‘would be Operable by the time ARH
closes.

Jim Tederman was also supportive of
the idea of the recreational center. Rein-
forcing Drake's comments, he said.
“There is a real problem here. When we
have all-campus events Darby is often
unavailable, Quad is too small. and the
Gardner area is acoustically inap»
proprlate.” He said he “supports SGA’s
feeling that there are social needs” but he
is not yet certain oi the best ways to meet
them. He noted that one alternative to the
new recreational center would be the
Showing of films in Roberts and the
building of a smaller center just for con
certs, In his final comment he said that ifit
were decided that a new building is needed
for both functions, then the students had
come up with an excellent design.

whatever opinions these players have in
this ongoing story, it is the trusatees that
will have the final say. For that, students
and administrators probably will have to
wait until May.

that they were more intelligent and think-
ing, and that the women in the class would
be uninterested in politics. We took a trip
to Thalin and stopped in at a bar. and she
apologized to the women ior taking us to
such a ‘rough‘ place."

In a Visit full of memorable experiences,
both Kina and Peggy had difficulty nar-
rowing down one that was especially im-
portant to them. Kina discussed her Visit to
the grave of Akmatova, a Russian poet
who lived through the Russian Revolution
and both World Wars. The grave was un-
marked except for a profile of Akmatove
in stone and the many flowers her ad»
mirers had left there. “We walked through
the countryside to the graveyard and there
was this grave, My friends and I left
ﬂowers and, in all, it was a very moving
experience,”

Peggy said that on her last night in
Moscow, she and her friends were waiting '
in line for a restaurant. After hours of not
moving she said, “A ioreign-looking man
walkéd up into the restaurant and just got ,
a seat. You would have thought he was’
starting a revolution. But. people were
eventually able to laugh it off and started
cracking jokes. Then I felt the true collec-
tive spirit of Russia; that we were all in
this together. That spirit is what i
remember most."
