Change for the Sake

of Change?

To the Editor:

I trust that I am not the only Stu»
dent on campus who is alarmed by
Waldo Walker's decision to use his
“stump” to call tor a core cur-
riculum, He has presented an
argument which resLs on premises
which are shaky at best; also, he
draws a Conclusion which I think
ignores one of the most important
tenets of Grinnell's educational
philosophy.

Walker asserLs that previous at-
tempts to reinstate a core cure
riculum ioundered in part due to
“staffing considerations" and
”loss oi opportunity to teach,..
‘favorite courses’." He then points
out that the iaculty size was
smaller when the core curriculum
was dropped than it is now. He can
veniently [ails to describe either
the number of upperslevel courses
and the frequency with which they
were altered or the size of the re,
quired courses. Any small college
will necessarily have to limit its
course offerings; to aggravate this
problem at Grinnell even while the
faculty would like to reduce its
work load is a grotesque absurdity
To negate uie advantage of small
classes by stuiiing disinterested
students into required courses
would be still worse. Further, even
the best protessors must enjoy
their subjects to teach effectively,
Granted, someone has m teach in-
troductory level Classes; however.
having fallen victim to professors
who clearly despised doing so, I
cannot see the value in coercing
them to teach more required
courses. And Mr. Walker has ap
parently iailed to consider the
possibility that the lack oi faculty
concern which he decries may in»
dicate that Grinnell's professors
have consciously concluded that
there is no problem.

Another reason which Walker
identifies for the reluctance to
reinstate a core curriculum is
possible negative eiiects on the ape
plicant pool, which is now much
larger. Yet. does anyone know
what role Grinnell's comparative
lack oirequirements plays in those
students' decisions to apply here? l
know that i am not the only current

student who iound the absence oi a
core curriculum a strong incentive
to come to Grinnell.

Walker seems to he advocating
change merely ior to own sake.
The notion oi demonstrating
academic vitality by increasing
curricular rigidity is ridiculous.
That 95% ot a sample oi ioiir year
colleges have made major changes
in their curricula in recent years is
no reason tor us to do so; 95% oi
iour year colleges are not oi Grin-
nell's calibrc. Also, Walker bans
dies the term “general education”
about as it it were a conceptual
butterily net with which he intends
to catch an exceptionally
pedestrian species; his deiinition
oi the term, “integrative inter—
disciplinary courses that are re-
quired oi all students." has merit
only ior its alliterative use oi pret-

ty, poetic polysyllabics, not for .
clarifying what he would like to '

say.

Finally, the philosophy at Grin-
nell, both educationally and
residentially. is based upon the
iostering of personal responsibility

among its students We are en- ,

couraged to seek iniorrnation and
advice concerning decisions which
affect our lives, whether they in
volve lifestyle or academics;
however, the iinal choice does, and
should continue, to rest with the
students ourselves. High school
graduates who wish to be absolved
oi responsibility tor themselves
have a multitude or possible col»
logos and universities irom which
to choose, Let us not send Grinnell
galloping alter die herd which
follows a prescriptive, pater»
nalistic lead bull in the hope that
the chase will prove beneficial to
our collective cardiovascular
system, to borrow Walker‘s
metaphor.

Unless, as Walker contends. the
faculty is too enervated by study-
ing and teaching, they should
perhaps give some consideration
to the notion of instituting a core
curriculum; i am coniideni that
they will conclude that it is a poor
idea 7 Wil|iam B. Turner, '88

 

 

US. News? top
report root of changes?

To the Editor:

1 am a very concerned
Sophomore. I am worried because
Grinnell College is losing the
qualities that have made it a great
institution.

I first looked at Grinnell during
my junior year oi high school. At
that time Grinnell had not been
written up in US. News and World
Report. The only reputation Grin-
nell had was the one that had been
created through many years oi ex~
cellence in education and devotion
to its students who came from all
over to find the “Grinnell Ex-
perience." After one visit to cam-
pus, I knew that Grinnell was not
just another “small liberal arts
college " l was impressed by the
small class size, professors who
were truly interested in students.
and an administration that cared
about its students and consulted
them when making decisions that
aIIected their education, During
my senior year, U 3, News came
out with its now very iamous arti-
cle, At first I thought this report
was great it brought in ional at
tention to the characteristics that
made Grinnell special,

However, times have changed at
Grinnell. I am now a student and I
am beginning to wonder what hap
pened to the Grinnell I used to
know. The college has become so
engrossed With its place among na-

pinion

pond to Walker’s state of the

tional institutions that it is moving
away from its foundations Grin-
nell is heading towards fewer
classes and the ones that remain
are being enlarged. The ad
ministration is making decisions
that affect the student body
without student knowledge or in-
put. When asked why? the ad-
ministration’s iavorite response is
that other schools on the US. News
list are also moving in those direc~
tions.

This school is not called
Carleton, Williams, or Oberlin.
US. News pointed Grinnell out [or
what it had accomplished on its
own and not ltS attempt to coniorm
to another school's lead.

It is unfair to change the school
without student input or
knowledge. We have all made an
important decision to come here.
We did this because we saw in
Grinnell something special By
making changes in areas like class
size, Grinnell is cheating its cure
rent students and lying to its pro
spectives. The proiessors do have
a heavy load However, this pro-
blem should not be solved at the ex-
pense oi the students. Something
needs to be done so all Sides are
treated fairly. students are a very
important part of this college,
Without students, Grinnell would
be a very empty place. 7 Paul
Russell.

Walker’s

‘ ‘Vision’ ’
is not
[student’s

To the Editor:

Waldo Walker is a man of vision.
He has a vision of Grinnell College
vaulting from a measly Number
Nine on the US. News and World
Report’s Top Ten to Number One.
The way in which Waldo Walker
hopes to go about this vaulting pro
cess is by iollowing Campus
Trends. He wanm to do what 75% of
these schools are doing and what
95% of those are doing and what
pretentious east coast schools
twice as old as Grinnell are doing.
He apparently believes that by
mimicking Numbers One through
Eight, Grinnell will be a better
place,

I have a vision too. lenvismn a
school that is not obsessed with
(rankings. A school that can stand
on its own merits, not someone
else‘s A school where being dif-
ferent is alright. where people are
shown how to lead, not iollow.
Where the individual is encouraged
lto be his or her own self. I want to
go to a school that reflects these
ideals in its vision.

I guess Waldo Walker and I do
not see eye to eye. — Rick Wallace
