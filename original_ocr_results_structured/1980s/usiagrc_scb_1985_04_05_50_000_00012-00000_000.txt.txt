Much promise expected from young baseball team

First. the good news

[\t [he core of the '85 Pioneer baseball
team are {our veterans. Junior co-
captam chuck Blomquist will handle
the catching chores again this year. As
a _ phoinore last year Blomquist hit
.- with one home run. And behind the
plate he committed only seven errors in
ninety chances. a .922 tielding average.

'l'llirdsyear man and co-captain Neil
\ieintraub moves trom right iieid to
shortstop this year. Oddly for a short
stop. Weintraub throws leftshanded

iiers on halls hit to his right

But head coach John Martinek has no
qualms about moving him to the infield.
"Neil is a tough kid . . . I think [he]

pressed to duplicate his periect 23 tor 23
iielding in right iieid lastyear. And let’s
hope that his 176 average at the plate

Sullcllrhlltlllg sophomore Roger
Chalmers will be Weintraub's running
mate at secoild‘base. As a freshman he
led the tealn iii hits with 19 and was 59
solid in hitting al .358. But with an .333
tielding percentage. he lett a little to be
desned.

"ll vie can get him to become a little
bit more stable in the inlield situation.
he'll be a tough all»ar0und ball player
[or us." said Martinek

Junior southpaw Steve Worth. an all
conference selection at first. base'
rounds out the Pioneers' veteran core.
At the plate he led the team in hitting
last year at .360, and on the mound he
tallied the Pioneers' only conference
victory. against Monmouth. “He’s a

complete ball player.” Martinek said

But the '85 Pioneers will not be a
veteran ball club. A good recruiting
year netted a crowd oi ireshmen. Nine
oi the eighteensperson roster are
rookies.

"I'd say it's probably the strongest
group oi freshmen that l've probably
e er had at Grinnell." said Martinek

here’s a lot of ireshmen who have
played in winning. championship. very

high-school level,"

Four of them e outlielders lan Lin.

amount of talent in the outfield." said
Martinek.

the team. But in left field, Lin, bothered

"His arm is not real good.” said Mar-
tinek “That's why we moved Ferguson

him and Mike can throw it in." Kidding.
right? “No."

And now the bad news,

But Blomquist thinks that the team

And the forecast?
