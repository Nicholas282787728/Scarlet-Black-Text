Women’s Pioneers
Prepare for Tough

Competition

by Blair Davison

After a January 25 win over Monmouth
College. the Women's Basketball team
now posts a division record of 1 win and 3
losses. .

AS the record indicates. the Lady
Pioneers had a frustrating first half of the
season. But the team is now gearing up tor
the challenging conference games in
February.

This weekend the team plays both Knox
and Monmouth. Having lost to Knox on
January 21 by a socre of 65751, and beating
Monmouth by two points last Saturday.
both games should be good matches. The
players seem confident as they approach
this tough competition.

With many returning players, and some
new additions. the '85-'86 Women’s Basket-
ball team is strong and highly skilled. Five
new players have added dimension to the
team.

Freshman Jessica Toft is ranked second
in assists in the Midwest Conference as of
January 20. Elizabeth Mchmsey. a return
ing player, is among the top twenty in the
conference in scoring, rebounding. and re
shooting.

Joining Toft and Mchmsey in con-
ference standing are Elizabeth
Schumacher (lourteentl-i in scoring). and
Deb Eastman (nineteenth in scoring).

Why doesn't the team's record better
reﬂect its obvious potential?

After the loss to Knox Coach Dee Fairs
Child commented on her squad’s perlorr
mance: ”We‘ve got the skills — the Women
have shown that in practice. Right now the
main problem is probably 95 percent men-
tal.”

A better sense of confidence was evident
in the locker room this week when
Elizabeth Mchmsey said. “We‘re getting
better after Christmas...now we’re going
to be the spoilers of the conference..."
