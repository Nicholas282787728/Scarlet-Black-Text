Women’s Studies:
Here at Last

Irv Ma nnghan

Mary L n Bree has been recently nam-
ed the Louise Noun Professor of Women’s
Studies at Grinnell

She has described her role in the iuture
nt'Womeli's Studies here as part ofa multir
disciplinary etfori that will begin by
recognizing and building upon historical
precedents in woine s scholarship, in
eluding achievements of the major iigures
of the Feminist movement as a whole. and
incremental advances that specific
pioneering individuals have made toward
the integration of women into their
disciplines,

Broe previously taught at the University
of Notre Dame and. most recently. at the
State University of New York tsUNYt at
Binghamton.

Her appointment to the Noun Chair
came alter her visit to Grinnell in Spring,
1925; it concluded a ditficult, extensive
search by faculty and student search com-
mittees that included interviews at
numerous candidates. One taetar hinderr
ing a quick decision regarded the dual
nature of the position itself. The Noun
Chair is to both teach Women Studies and
be responsible for the incorporation ot

women’s studies into the curriculum at
Gl'lmlell,

As at many Institutions like Grinnell. the
com bination of qualities conducive to suc-
cess :Is a professor are not always coma
patlble With those to "be in at good ad-
ministrator, aIid vice versa Broe's ex-
periences initiating change from her posr
lien on the faculties of Notre Dame and
Elllgllamton Will be helpful to her in this
respect

Bl'oe stresses that the future of Women's
Studies at Grinnell Will not rest upon her as
an autonomous individual issuing
monolithic pieces of dogma to a campus
community that would be inevitably and
quickly alienated from the decisions and
deciSion-maker instead. she intends to in
Itlate a multidisciplinary effort to
recognize. diffuse knowledge of. and build
upon the advances she believes have
already been made within our academic
community,

it certainly cannot be said that Grinnell
has been among the first oflts peers to em»
brace a curriculum change involving the
incorporation of Women‘s Studies. but

counlry's economic. political, and social
problems The convocation speaker will be
Dr Lorenzo Meyei

The Rosenfield Program is a service
organization to the college. whose main
function is to give students the background
they need in certain public affairs issues.

"The primary purpose of the program is
to foster what i think is a longstanding
tradition of the college ol interest and in-
volvement in public aftairs issues, and
also to promote careers in public service,"
Mr. Meyer said,

Through its various symposia and
speakers, the program tries to bring to the
forefront certain important critical issues
and give them a balanced treatment so
that students begin to think tor themselves
and come up With their own solutions. This
hopefully generates interest which may
lead to later work in dealing with these
problems. either through internships or
careers, ,

since Moyer took over the directorship
last fall, one of the most important
speakers to visit Grinnell was Robert s,
McNamara. former Presidentofthe World
Bank and former Secrctary of Defense.
His importance in the Kennedy ad
ministration and his current views on
, tar wars" made him a particularly ex-
citing speaker.

Mr, ivtoyer admitted that it is often ditr
licult for the program to attract famous
people to Grinncll bccaiise ot the time it
takes to travel here and back,

when they arrive, however. --in general

Logo Explained

ti} Din ill .luIIes

Starting this tall and continuing over the
next lour to Six months. the new Grinlicll
logo will be implemented. The $40.th
spent on the designing ol the logo will be
the only additional cost to the college as
the switch is made, since the old logo will
be gradually phased out,

The toriner logo was used in conjunction
with perhaps as many as thirty dlfterelil
typefz es in its approximately twenty
years as the school svmbol it was the col-
lcge‘s view that in order to achieve better
recognition. the use of the logo should be
unilied

Following unsuccessful attempts at solv~
ing the problem themselves. the
Marketing Task Force started the search
for a pi-olessional firm to do the Job
Richard Ridgeway, Director of Public
Relations for the college, explains that the
reason an outside firm was called in is
because
specializes in logo design was Judged to be
the best idea,

Alter receiving proposals from six
graphic design iirms. it was judged by the
Marketing Task Force that Lee and Young
commnunication otfered the best choice

John Young. President of Lee and
Ynung. feels that the main asset ofthe new
logo is that it can be reproduced in a val-lac
ty of media and sizes. as well as in black

As tor the similarity between the logos.
Young admits that it has the llrm's intenr
tioii to use the laurel leaf as a bridge bet-
ween the old and the new. “a iotofthe pmr
grains we do are updates, We wanted to
put the emphasis on the college’s namc . ,.
and de-emphasize the leaves,” he ex-
plains

itidgcway sees the logo as a basic tool in
an merall marketing campaign At the
pi- ent time. 7380‘? of all Grinnell apr
plicants are accepted tor admission, ft is
the college's aim to attract more up-
plicaiits and therfore have the means to be
more selective in their admission process
This has caused the college to start paying
more attention to promoting its image

The possibility that this image and the
atmosphere oi Grinnell might change is
disputed by President George Drake. “I
am firmly convinced that the character oi
this college is rock solid." he stresses.

The fact that the new logo was met with
dissatisfaction by many of the students
does not surprise Young, “It's an emo
tional issue. And with most people. if you
give them a choice between something
new and something old, they'd take the old
one." he adds

Pub Changes ’

by .Ieiiniter Ilalcruw

The Pub. or what is currently a “student
lounge" that used to be the Pub. Is
undergoing some changes,

Last week the Pub was the place of two
allrcampus parties; one of them was an
aver-thorhump party and the other was
sponsored by Cleveland Hall

The first overallie-hump party of the
.year was very well attended, making some
upperclassmen complain about the influx
of freshmen and sophomores in a place
that was traditionall) the hang out of
juniors. seniors and other Pub rats,

When the Pub closed last May after
Alumni Weekend. it had finished its tl’iir~
teenth year as a beer liar and student hang
out on campus, During that time the Pub
was student run and paid out close to
130.000 dollars to cmpluycc- tiitd
managers. according to John Worley. Pro-
lcssoi- of Plillttsopli},

Closing the Pub raised ii lot of questions

In order to make some decisions about
what the campus can do with the former

meeting of everyone interested in the Pub
on last Friday.

Although the meeting was only attended
by about 15 to 20 students and Iormer Pub
