Statements of Intent

 

Presidents

Volume:

 

Pleshette Ham b?

There are many reasons why
i am running for President of
SGA, but I will elaborate on
three. First, I believe tlle Pres-
ident must be able to represent
tlte students, and address tlleir
concerns. As a Student Advisor
and as Chairperson ofthe Black
Student Task Force, I have been
involved in such concerns as:
lack of diversity in the curricu-
lum, lack of real buffer days,
lack of diversiﬁed faculty, and
tile lack of Administrative coni-
initrrient, in writing, to student

issues and coltcerns, including
most recently the 372 program.
Second, I want to establish a
better relationship between the
Administration and the Student.
Body. As Student Assistant for
Mino ity Recruitment. as Chair-
person of BSTF. and as Founder
and active member of Goalie
tion for Awareness, Unity and
Social Equality ((‘.A.U 213.), l
have had direct contact with the
Faculty and the Administration
I have made them account for
their actions. It is important
for the people responsible for
the daily functioning of Grille
nell to listen to, and respond
to, not just the Trustees or the
Alumni, but also to the Stu-
dent Body. Third, as an'orga-
llizer of the Speakeasy, and as
a member of Gates‘ HAG corn-
iiiittee, I have had to be out-
spokcn, yet calm enough to or
ganize, motivate, and persuade
all the people l was working
for and with so the job would
be done ill the most effective
and etiicient way. I think my
record speaks for itself. GRINV
NELL NEEDS A PRESIDENT
WHO IS DEDICATED, HARD
WORKING, SENSITIVE AND
COMMITTED:

Paul Froese.

Today is a new day. As I
sit in this computer room, I no-
tice the students around me. 1
am filled with the uncontrolinble
urge to do good for them. i
know this sounds elicheic. but i
am one that will forever believe
that tlle world can always be
bettered. This is why 1 am run.
ning for the most powerful and
inﬂuential position on this came
pus, SGA president. Soaring

 

with new ideas—”q', my mind feels
free aild uninhibited by the con—
ventions of this campus. That
is why i have decided to make
some open remarks in the form
of u poem:

and you will see

i‘m the best president

there ever will be

i have some faults

i miss some classes

but all tlle other candidates

are total (nice people)

I feel that the pos on ofPresr
ident of the SGA is a very se.
rious and important job and
should not be taken lightly. I
would like to tell you where I
stand on sortie issues so you will
be better able to make an ed-
llcated vote, First of all, 1 am
anti-nozi. l believe that it would
be detrimental for this school
to have a Nazi as president. I
am not afraid to say this and 1
hope you will stand up with me
against Nazism. Knowing my.

SGA is rtt a plateau. It has
a very efﬁcient treasury system,
its representation to the faculty
on academic matters is excels
lent, it has a mediocre com~
mitteo system, and a poor cor»
respmldellce with the students.
Why is SGA the way it is?

Russ Malteson, the deal mart,
revamped the way SGA Ila]!-

he brought SGA out of debt
and created reserve fttnds by
simply organizing the treasury.

Rule, ring a bell) there has been
no signiﬁcant renovation in the
ofﬁce of president. WHY?

Good question, I believe it is
because no one has come along.

SGA's ettectiveuess and then

two years of SGA experience
serving under four pre. dents.

Board meetings and triple that
number of meetings with ('abr

the constitution from serving as
Parliamentarian well enough to

Let SGA rise to a new level;
make yourself part of a campus
that is more aware, more active,
and more enthusiastic about imr
provement. These aren‘t nlir»
acles here, no bizarre notions,
just simple knowledge of what
needs to be done. Do you want
a reuovator and leader? I am
that person. I hope you saw
my statement l passed out ear-
lier and read my plan, 1 hope
you saw my emphasis not only

on ideas but on my ability to im-
plement ideas. Thank you for
considering Greg Evans.

beliefs in in orderly and easy to
read manner:

1. 1 am a mutt issue candi-
date and don‘t believe on run.

2. I would like. to increase po-
litical activity or. this campus.

3. I would like to see more rlu~
dity on campus (maybe holding
SGA meetings in the nude)

4. I would like to fund more

5. i would like to reduce
SGA meetings to only 15 min-
utes long by letting members
say no more than 5 words in a
row.

6, I believe that our school
colours should be mauve and
brunt umber.

7. I think that this school

should put its huge endowment
to good use by giving it to the
poor. (why do we need it? we
never use it.|

1 am not afraid to take on the
responsibilities of Student Gov-
ernment. For one semester I
have met the responsibilities o
being an l.M. coordinator and
feel that this was an excellent
period of growth in my life. 1
also know the SGA. By attend-
ing several meetings, i believe
that l have a pretty good ideal
of what goes on (I also read in,
senator’s notes occosionnlly).

best job 1 possibly can and tr

possible, God bless us, every-

100 Special Edition
A Letter to

the Campus
Community

Today’s special edition is an
unusual event. The Studeiit
Publications and Radio Com~
mittee hopes that the need for
such a special issue does not
arise again. it is being printed
to allow students a chance to tea
spoud to information and opin—
ions printed about Student Gov-
ernment Association candidates
before the election next Wednes-
dayr Since candidates did not
have to ﬁle until Saturday and
the election is next Wednesr
day, only one regular issue of
the Scarlet and Black would be
printcd in that time. We feel
that giving students a chance to
respond to what appears in tn.
day's paper is important enough
to justify this special electlon is.
sue. We have asked the Election
Board to consider changing the
timing of these events so that a
special edition is not required in
the future

Authorizing this issue was not
easy. Committee members felt
strongly that they did not want
the 5 a B to endorse candle
dates. The Editorial Board felt
strongly that they should be al.
lowed to do it. After extended
and often heated discussion at
two meetings and contemplation
over a week‘s time, the commit—
tee voted 3»! to allow publica-
tion with one abstention due to
conflict of interest.

Endorsements of candidates
reflect the opinions of the Edi
lo'rial Board of this paper and
are not necessarily the opinions
of the Student Publications and
Radio Committee. Both the
Committee and the s a B
would like to encourage you to
respond to anything in this is-
sue. Letters to the Editor will
be accepted typed on paper to
Box Tel through tomorrow or
by computer to SANDB until
8:00 a.m. Thursday. lf possi-
ble all letters will be printed in
full, but it may be necessary to
edit some because ofspaee limir
tations.

Radio Committee and the Scars

week’s issues helpful in costing
your vote next Wednesday in
