Leeches

Welcome to October 1986. Another
blissful autumn arrives to the ivory
tower culled Grim-ell College. The trees
are losing their leaves, the football
team is losing and the student body is
gcoring up for tho long, grinding houl
to ﬁnals week in December. Seems to
be no different than any other autumn
here in Crinnell except that 1986 is an
election year.

Here in the ivory tower. many
students tend to forget that they are liv-
ing in a town with people who have real
jobs ond reol political concernn For

are important. The candidates that win
elections have a real impact on their
litter and their community.

Too often. Crinnell students lose
sight of their role as community
citizens as they become isolated in their
tiny world of Grinnell College. For-
tunately. candidates running for
elected ofﬁces in Washington and Des
Moines appear on campus to appeal to
college voters. Yet more often than not.
these candidates confront students who
are very ignorant of the issues that
directly affect the town of Grinnell and
the state of Iowa.

As community citizens. students
should not take their role as Grinnell
ootert lightly. Grinnell College is not on
island. The college and its student body
are just as vital to Grinnell’s livelihood
as the town of Grinnell is to the
college‘s livelihood.

Elections are an important way for
all citizens to invest in their commun-
liy. By voting intelligently. both‘ Grin-
nell and Iowa beneﬁt from having
politieol representatives who have been
chosen on their stands on the issues
and not on the style of their clothes.

Although not all Grim-ell students
are regi‘ntered Iowa uoterr. awareness
ofthe istuot concerning Iowa and Erin-

students in becoming less isolated and
more it community citizen. And for
those students who are registered, it is a
civic duty to vote from us informed a
position do possible.

Grinnell students have an obligation
to participate in the community and to
take seriously their role as ooterr. lfwe

Tenure Defended

Dear Editor, ,

“The policy of tenure is seriously aﬁecr
ting the quality of American higher educa-
film."

The Scarlet and Black has almost hit the
nail on the head concerning the problem of
attracting and keeping quality educators
at Grinnell College and other educational
institutions.

Unfortunately. the editor of the Scarlet
and Black has drawn some faculty conclu
sions concerning the retention of less
qualified professors. Tenure is not what
causes bad professors and teachers to be
maintained on our campuses, rather the
important factor in this cause-effect rela-
tionship is the SELECTION of professors
and teachers for tenure review,

Crime“ has lost many qualiﬁed laculty
m the [our years that I've been here and in
the majority of the cases. if has been due to
the lack of selection for tenure.

Since tenure is also a very necessary
factor to attract professors (no one wants
to put in long hours on a job that may not
last). what are some ways to improve the
tenure process, insuring the selection of
faculty with excellent teaching abilities
and also strong academic backgrounds?

First. let’s see how important student in
put is to the iacully here. Do students ac
lively participate in EPC and do non-EPC
students attend discussions where can-
didates for teaching positions at Grinnell
present their qualifications? For student
input to be effective, students have to par-

llclpale!

Secondly. what about. “revitalization“
programs for professors who may have
become bogged down in the "Grinnell Ex-
pertence" in the middle of a cornfield? We
can’t expect quality leaching from bored
or overworked teachers. How available
are leaves of absence? How about continu»
lng education and research? what is the
salary schedule like?

All the questions so far have dealt with
already tenured professors, but in order to
attract luiurc prolessors who can later
become tenured faculty. we need to find
out what kind of incentives Grinnell offers
them.

Do junior faculty have the opportunity to
continue graduate research and is it en-
couraged by the college in the form of
leaves of absence, student research
assistants and pay increases for published
works? What is the salary schedule for
nonrtenured professors?

The problem with quality teaching
across the United States is not so easily
boiled down to the obvious fact that tenure
IS an Institution in education.

The problem with teachin ls multi-
faceted and involves the lack a respect for
the profession. the need for greater stu~
dent participation in the selection of new
faculty as well as in the selection for
tenure and the continuing education and
”mental perks" for new faculty and
tenured faculty who are stuck in a
leachlng rut. Jennifer Halcrrtw

Logo Liked

Dear Editor,

For those students who still find it hard
to accept the new logo, I wnuld have to
point out that its main purpose to to attract
better students. These better students help
the college by boosting our reputation as a
selective school. l happen to think that a
new logo is not enough, and here is my plan
to improve the quality of the students at
Grinnell.

First, we need to get rid of the bad
students. One way would be to ﬂunk any
student mat made a “D“ or an “F." Then
any student that. did not have a 3.0
semester grade point average should be
put on Academic probation and dismissed
if it continues (or more Lharl one semester.

Mere grades are not the only way to
purge this school of bad students. We could
require that students get a 35 grade point
average every semester to be eligible for
financial aid. Also, me students class
selection would have to be reviewed 50 that
we could check to make sure that no one is
avoiding hard classes. Students Should on.
ly be able to lake two 100 level classes their
