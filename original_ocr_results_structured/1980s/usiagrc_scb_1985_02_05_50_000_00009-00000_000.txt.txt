Constructive Engagement in South Africa

t Apartheid is universally condemned asa
moral outrage by the American public
ifet. whenever action is called ior
against the system. one will immediately
hear voices that counsel inaction on all
sorts oi grounds. This lack oi consensus

uarantees the Survival oi Apartheid
despite the iact that it has been denounced
l,n the rhetoric oi every importantleader in
the world. why does the world watch
passively as Apartheid grows ironi
strength to strength with each passing
year?

’lhe major reason ior the world s

v'aciliating policy towards South Airica is
due to South Airica s heavy trading with
multinational corporations and liiians
nial institutions. The international
community is incapacitated to act collec-

- The other group oi people say that they
are dissuaded irom action because oi their
fear that divestment will hurt the very peos
pie it was supposed to help 7 the Black
South Airicans. They claim that their real
concern is the prospect oi some material

must understand the role and history oi in-
ternational capital in South Airica in the
context oi past and present day conditions
in that country. The decades that have
passed since World War ll have seen a
steadily increasing American investment
in South Airica. Part oi the reason was
that this country steadily assumed the role
oi the world economic leader. The other
part was that South Africa‘s traditional
European trading partners showed in
creasing reluctance to prolit irom Apars
theid once they noted that their capital
provided the lite blood to the Apartheid
monstrosity.

increased American investment in
South Airica has nol been coupled with the
alleviation oi the situation ior Black South
Airicans, instead we have witnessed
mounting brutal repression and murder or
our people by the system which ieeds upon
American capital. Sophisticated military
and computerware were rushed to South
Airica at the time when the system ap-
peared at its weakest and the pass laws ad-
ministration seemed destined to failure. ,
as a South Airican. know that the essence
oi constructive engagement to be what has
transpired since its vigorous inception and
pursuit. Far irom dismantling Apartheid.
the Sullivan principles provide a
sinokescreen that allows Apartheid to
operate relatively undisturbed. This tact
cannot be distinguished ironi the interest
oi multinational corporations in South
Airica. nor can it be distinguished irom the
American government's passion to ensure
the continued iiow oi minerals ironi South
Airica. The tact is that all these purposes
are host sci-tied under Apartheid.

Airican minority regime has a contract

should not come as a surprise to one who
has seen constructive engagement in ac
tinn. I dare Speak on behali 01 all South
Airicans or good will that we have ab-
solutely no use ior advice such as that
handed to us by the Counter demonstrators
during the weekend.

In conclusion, 1 wish to note that there is
nothing in South Africa's criminal record
to suggest that the racist leader will eve'r,
through subtle persuasion, accede to the
demands or the people ior ireedom in their»
own country. The US. has stood in-

As long as the terms of trade continue to’
dominate the United States's relationship
with South Alrica. barbarous murder and
exploitation of South Airicans will con-

masters of the destiny oi others will cons

Apartheid should continue to survive lor

The only reasonable and peaceful solu-
tion to Apartheid is divestment. No loss of
material Standards can Justiiiably com-
pensate ior the prospect oi the eradication
oi Apartheid and the recovery oi human
dignity

These Sentiments are echoed by all
peace Ving South Africans. Indeed. no
price is high enough to pay for Apartheid.
Let me quote two South Airican leaders.
Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko, Mandel
shortly after being sent to life sentence in
prison. said. ”1 have cherished a dream
{or a free and democratic society in South
Airica. ior which 1, hope to live and
achieve. but ll need be. 1 mil die {or it."
Biko echoed the same sentiments beidré
they killed him t is better to die for an
ideal that shall live. than to live [or an
ideal that Shall die."

Whether youl"re going around a pattern

angle. or going inside oiit. it all amounts to
the same thing. We are what we are. and
no must strive iirst to understand it. nd
only then to improve on it '
