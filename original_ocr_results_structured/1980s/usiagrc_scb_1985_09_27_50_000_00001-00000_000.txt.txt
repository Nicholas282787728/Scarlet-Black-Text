Peace, you plan - n eventso captivating. so
inspiring. that it just might lead to an end
ol the arms race,

From March to November. 1986, PRO-

March.“ Five thousand people will leave
homes. jobs. and schools to walk across
the entire nation. from Los Angeles to

Curt Van Meter, a PROPeaoe represenr
taiive will be on the Grinnell campus today
trom 6:007:00 pm. in ARH 115 to speak
with anyone interested in PROVPeace’s

[illeeii miles a day. passing through Las

Mixner cites two reasons [or the choice
