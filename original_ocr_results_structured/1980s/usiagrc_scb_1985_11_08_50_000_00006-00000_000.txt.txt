hard. as they have kept working at main

said Hamon

Some students do have problems going
back lhome] For a foreign student who
has just come rtghl out or their country
there is a period oI time when they have to
adjust to values and norms here Once

He contiiiucd to explain how student
may respond to those necessary ads
jilslliicnls n hen he said. "They go back to
their country and see things train a due
terent perspective Either they go back
and pick up where they iett oil'. or they con-
tinue With the thoughts they had here."

Seape. however. did not generalize. “ll
depends on how tliitei-ent each country is
that the student is going back to For me.
Ihe change was not difficult...“ is not a

Afr‘ical. whether they are all black or all
white or mixed. One tends to target that
there are not other races there. when you
are used to it being that way."

Whether or not the 180 itself promotes
cultural awareness IS open to question.
However, as Seape said. “[International
students] obviously change. both because
of themselves, and the United States. You
meet people who usually think dirterently
You gain a broader perspective. which is a
good thing."

Acevedo agreed when she said “it is
good to bring foreignistudents. [The in-
teractionlls mutally beneficial."
Awareness seems to be an inevitable
result of interaction.

Most importantly. on final analysis. the
150 does provide an outlet in which inter»
national students can discuss the problems
unique to their experiences as foreign
students. Hamon said. “we are most cons
cerned that those who need help get it.
They may go to whomever they want: to

“Coffee a nickel. some things never
change " was an ad [or Cunningham Drug
and Fountain in 1976. ~

Small towns almost always have a place
where everyone meets tor a cup bi coffee
Cunningham Drug is Grinnell's place.

The store was started in 193E by Jim
Cunningham Sr The drugstore has been
open 47 years and it is much different now
that it was in 1938.

Jim Cunningham Jr. owns the store now
and he said “we did not have a fountain (in
the original store). The Grinnell grads of
the forties and early fifties remember the
Candyland Fountain which was in the west
hall of this {the present site)." Cunn-
ingham Drug was a separate store but
there was a doorway between the two
businesses. ’

The Candyland Restaurant has its own
history. The store was a candy store beiore
it became a restaurant. The store was
Owned by Ted and Pete Stalfenou and they
made then uwn candy. Cunningham said
he "can remember as a little kid the old

where they made old fashioned real
"candyrcandyﬂ' The name oi the
restaurant came li-om the candy store but
eventually the store was associated with
the Candyland Sundae that Cunningham's
still serves.

In 1954 the original store and the Can
dyland Restaurant burned down. The
owner oi the Candyland gave up his
business and Cunningham's rebuilt adding
a rountain by "popular demand." said Jim
Cunningham.

when the drugstore reopened. Arlene
Davenport who used to work [or Can-
dyland. came to manage Cunninghamn's
fountain She bi'éught the recipe for the
sundae with her and even though it's a
relatively simple receipe using mare
shmalluw and chocolate. no one has been
able to duplicate it

Cunningham‘s is also known [or its
nickleJa-cup coffee. "The store is commit-
ted to the price,” said Cunningham. The
store ran a promotion in 1976 alter they I'illr

ads said "coffee. a nickle a cup some
things never change."

The Customers are dedicated to the foun-
tain and its coffee: several years ago they
started an unofficial Colfee Club, On a
patron's birthday he or she buys coltee [or
anyone who comes into the store lrom a
a m. until noon. Then. "a couple of days, a
week. or a month later the guy comes in to
pay his ebiiee bill." said Cunningham, The
coffee club is so popular that “the calendar
is booked solid. Sometimes you can't get in
on your birthday." according to Cunnr
iiigham

Cunningham's is an anachronism in to-
day's lastrpaced, high-priced world. Jim
Cunningham summed up the character oi
the store when he commented on how
Davenport makes the Candyland Sundae:

”I let her make it and i don't pay that
much attention. 1 don't think it's a national
secret. but she seems to have a touch with
it and people that try to make it on their
own... it must be her touch... because
nobody seems to have come up with really
the same thing," that might be somewhat
the flavor of the place."
