On life after
college

 

whén my father visited Grinnell a week
beiore Relays, i hall'rjokingly suggested
that he reflect on his college days and
write a “spoof” article about Liberal Arts
educations for the SkB Relays Edition. To
my surprise. he agreedl Time constraints
prevented him irom completing the article
'for the said edition, but in the mail last

 

week. I received' the following paragraphs.
with an attached note Saying “This is a
hurried assembling of ideas I had in mind
about the ‘Spoof’ of a Liberal
Education..,do with it What you like.‘Y So I
did. Please realize that these “ideas" and
experiences are necessarily male in
perspective. The message, however. is
universal, — J. Lincoln

relief The administralion said that a big
party has arranged and the busscs were
waiting, We jumped at the chance to get
away for a few days or more: they said we
could take as long as we liked

So we took our backpacks and our six
packs, said goodbye to our iriends until
next time. and left. Nobody remembered
to think twice. We just wanted an outlet.
We traveled to somewhere tn Iowa, hit the

down and we packed up to leave.

We first noticed that something was
wrong when the bus ride home took tl’lll‘r
teen hours. We arrived in Grinnell after
10:30 pm, The whole city was pitch dark.
The streets were deserted.

The campus was eerily Silent except for
the slowly rising howl oi the wind. We got
off the busses but the Resident Advisois
did not let us go, In hypnotic voices, they
told us to obey. We still had no idea that a
terrible, terrible spring ritual oi
monstrous proportions was about to be
perpetrated

Nobody knew what was happening. They
lined us all up. made us wear these strange
robes. and blindfolded us. We walked for a
while and then sat down. At the stroke of
midnight they let us remove the blindlolds
and the nightmare began Commence
ment.

The collective explosion of screams and
fleeting students was quickly subdued by a
menacing cordon oi black-clad proiessors
They wore mysterious symbols on their
robes and wielded fully certificd diplomas,
Torches glowed all around us. Our papers
fluttered above us like bats and perched in
the gnarled trees. taunting us.

Before us stood a large pavilion that
looked like a sacrificial altar. Upon it stood
the head priests oi the college. They cackl-
ed and stirred an immense gurgling pol,
scooping out awards and honors.

Towering over them was the insidious

Most of us stuffed our ears and crawled

The career counselor addressed them,
