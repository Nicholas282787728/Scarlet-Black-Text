Aching to get out or Grinnoll‘? Just
dying to get to the “big cityLDes
Moillcs? ”Sure,” you say, “but what
to do" Eating out would he nice, but
it's probably too expensive, and
besides, I don't know it it would be
good or not. and if not, it's a waste oi
money” etc, Well, now you’ll know!
There is a delighttully tnnky. not at all
expensive, tun place to eat in Des
Moincs. It's called the Spaghetti
Works, and it serves spaghetti.

Below I tell you about the food, a
word about the lunky decor. The
Spaghetti Wul'ks is in what looks like
an old lactory, but onc redecorated
with many allthue and antique-look
items such as old railroad signs, brass
railings, real wood mantles, mirrored
glass, stained glass, etc, it's very

Dinner for two run;

under ten bucks .

That’s for all the

you , can eat!

charming, easy on the eye, and quite
dllfcrent [roln downtown Gl'inncll

On entering Spaghetti Works. one
can either go to the bar area on the
right, or immediately to the dining
area on the tort. A hostess will greet
and seat you If you are going to con
centrate on dining, you could get
drinks at your table and/or wine lhe
dlinks ale highly recommended. lhcir
Pina Coladas and Daquiris are huge
frothy concoctions 'lhe Banana Dar
quiri has real bananas in it, not totally
decimated by the blender 'l'hcir lnlx~
cd drinks lManliattans, Scotch and
soda, ctc ) are also good.

Once you finish drinking, the talk
turns to food, or the lack thereof. You
more into the dining room (unless
you're already therel and are greeted
with a smile by your waiter/ress, ask-
ing if you've been there before. If not,
he/she explains how the menu works,
the salad bar, seconds, etc. The menu
is iull oi interesting things~hot ‘n
naked, hot ’n spicy. beer and cheese,
clams—and approximately 27 ditieront
types oi Spaghetti sauce.

That's the entire menu All 01 their
Sauces arc \VDliIlOl'ltll And, lor one
price. you get as many portions as
you can eat anti you lttn'l hare-to
have the same kind ill sauce each

time When you order for the first
time, you're directed to the salad bar,
wh' h is full of the usual staples,
chilies, bacon bits, croutons, and
ti-cshly grated pepper, and is served
out of the back at an anthue firetruck.
You c t the salad, and the spaghetti
alriv ,aiong with somc garlic bread
(The bl dd alld salad are included In
the pllCL‘ oi the meal.) It looks great.
The spaghetti is al dente, chewy
rather than mush, and the Sauce is
good. The garlic bread is phenomenal:
cheese, butter, and garlic all blending
woiulci-iully, The load quickly

vanishc , and your waiter/rcss
returns to take your order [or more.
Unlortuitatcly, extra garlic bread also
costs extra, but it's worth it, so you
order more bread with another serv-
ing of spaghetti.

And more, and more, until no more

Benny’s Nature Cabin

by Tony Flynn

Being number one is never easy Ask Ted Kennedy, or
George Bush. or Ronald Reagan Ask Jimmy Carter' in a
couple oi weeks when you re number one, you re a
reputation to live up to; only the best will survive,

For a long time now, Dickey’s Prairie Home in
Malcom ton US. Highway 63 at the intersection or 1780)
has been considered the number one night-time cating
establishment in the Grinnell area. Many thought
Dickey’s tor Benny’s Nature Cabin, as restaurant coll-
noisseurs are fond of saying) would buckle under the
immense pressure and publicity of being number one.

To determine the current state of Dickey's cuisine, I
recently made the long trip to ltlalcom, and
“experienced Benny‘s." I must report that Diekey‘s has
not only held its own, but the quality has actually in
creased!

Always a fastened-type haven, Dickey's continues to
explore new artistic territory in terms or hamburgers,
tenderloins, etc The milk shakes are thick, rich, and
oveitlowing. French tries are crisp and hot Ser vice is
snappy with a smile.

But iast toad |Sn t the only thing Dickey s has to error:
try the breakiast some time. Steaks won‘t stand up to
JD'S, but compare well With the Horn or Griimeil’s Best
Steak House, Chili is usually good; occasionally, though,
it's a bit ﬂat.

All menu items come in more than ample portions.
For an extra treat, come by at the dinner hour;
Dickey's has one of the better salad bars ill the area

Recommended [or those with large appetites. “the
double B Squared,” ti.e. a Dickey Burger platter with a
Dickey Burger on the side~it will last you two Ilaysl.
