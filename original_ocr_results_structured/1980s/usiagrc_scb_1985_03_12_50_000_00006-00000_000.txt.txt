Which Tired? Which Poor?

have you heard? We are just now on
the brink of a new civil war. Once again
such basic premises as liberty and
justice “for all" will be challenged. But
ironically enuugh, such sanguine civil
strife may hear take a human life from
the home of the “free," Yet bloody it
will be. as bloody it has been.

The' antagonist is the Reagan ad-
ministration, represented by the im-
migration and Naturalization Servtce
(INS). The deiense will be presented on
behalt oi Priests, Rabbis, u.s. laypeo-
ple and many Central Americans. it
short:’ The Sanctuary movement, This
is the struggle that most North
Americans will see or hear; this is the
“civil" war. It Won’t leave the coura
troom but will determine the future ap-
plication of refugee law and the laws on
harboring and conspiracy, The only
pa‘rticipaan of the courtroom struggle
who will witness the bloody portion oi
the War are the Central Americans.

» The Minnesota conference of the
United Methodist Church has reported
that in the first three years of the
decade over 200.000 Salvadorans have
illegally entered the United States seek-
ing reiuge along with tens or thousands
of Guatemalans. During that period an
a’verage of one thousand refugees per
month have been forcibly returned
lro'm the U.S. to their native countries.
Regarding their detention, “allegations
were heard in a U.S, district court in
California that refugees often received
poor treatment. limited access to
counsel, and solitary confinement
without a hearing. when ordered to im»
prove these conditions by Judge David

Kenyon. liVs appealed. stating *iiic
agency has no control over the actions
of its employees."

or the 46,000 reiugees who were ap»
proved ior political asylum in 1932. only
393 were from “noncommunist” counr
tries. such as El Salvador and
.Guatemala. The figures betray the ad-
ministration’s discriminatory practice.
the chances for these refugees are slim.
But what many never realize is that
many oi the reiugees never even get as
tar as to apply {or political asylum.

Conventional arguing would suggest
that the guilt here lies with the refugee.
But this is not so, First of all. the INS
has often been accused oi deporting
refugees without making clear to them
their rights ii.e, their right to apply for
political asylum.) While others: con-
cerned lawyers and Citizen groups
(both religious and secular.) attempt to
do this task In place of the lNS. this still
doesn’t get to one of the major pitialls,
Many of the refugees are scared to app»
ly. Again one mightcomment: “Well. if
they won't do it, they are Just making
things hard on themselves." Wrong
again.

lNS admits to the routine practice 0!
turning lists oi political asylum ap»
plicants over to the Salvadoran govern-
ment. The Salvadoran government, as
it is considered “friendly" by
Washington, is a trusted confidant in
this arena, But the response of the
reiugees and their supporters is that
the Salvadoran government. while it
may be lriendly to the people in
Washington, is nevertheless uniriendly
to is own people. The refugees fear
that. should they apply, and get turned
down and deported. as would be playing
by the rules Washington has set. they
would be in a much greater danger of
losing not only “liberty and happiness."
but life itself,

state Department office on Human
Rights is not convinced. He says ilatly:

with this message the Statue ol
Liberty stood welcoming the Euro
peans oi the 19th century, During 1985
an enormous renovation project will
channell millions of dollars into the
restoration oi the landmark. This is a
good time to consider the motive tor
restoring Ms. Liberty, If the motive is
to add to New York one more museum
piece. then we have nothing ior which to
be proud. If the motive is to renew Ema
ma Lazarus' pledge. then we must work
to make her call heard by everybody —
the Salvadorans. the Guatemalans and
all. Remember: her message is not a
symbol of America, but a goal toward
which we all must strive.
