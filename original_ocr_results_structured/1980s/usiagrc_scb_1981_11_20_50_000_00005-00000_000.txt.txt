Activists tace a crushing stigma on this
campus — the stigma oi being UNCOOL.
Recently I was accused (somewhat in fun,
but not entirely) by my economics pros
lessor of being a “typical liberal," one of
those bleeding heart, knee Jerk,
asdifferent~cause-everyrweek naive
idealistic students that come oozing out of
the mire of the late 60‘s, the era we are all
supposed to admire. Most likely he had
seen “my type" beiore when he was going
to school, pushing literature or a petition in
his race. He had seen my 1969 counterparts
trotting happily oii to the latest
demonstration, smug and secure that they
had iound the right liberal causes to de-
fend. What he had seen there was a mix-
ture oi idealism, genuine concern and
shallowncss: the simplistic mentality oi
someone who isliberal because her friends
are, who believes with ultimate, unques-
tioning taith that the Enemy is evil and
that her own actions are the only morally
conscienable course to take.

Ah, but I was not remcarnated from one

oi those, Activism on campuses has grown
and changed since then Our numbers are
smaller and our voices less abrasive The
focus is on education rather than grooving
on the group feeling of being morally right.
Our object is to become informed about the
issues and in doing so increase people's
awareness of mem, so that the democratic
process can work intelligently, That may
sound corny and idealistic, but it's the only
hope we've got.

This economist finds it amusing to see
the same faces in several different groups.
”So what's your issue next Week?" The im-
plication is that, being the flighty
teenagers that we are, we just hit from
liberal cause to futile liberal cause, always
looking painfully earnest and hysterically
concerned. This somehow exhibits a
shallowness, a lack of careful, critical
thought behind our words. I get this ieeling
from a few peers as well, although not so
boldly insinuated. They express it in mute
sneers of smug objectivity. Collecting
money ior El Salvadorean reiugees or

Illiei'al

distributing information on energy conserr
vation just isn't quite “cool."

According to the economist tanci many
otherst, the precipitous plunge from this
ivory tower will change our tune. Faced
with “real world” problems, we'll sues
comb to the pursuit of our own economic
self interst that we seem to deplore in
others, Fancy pant liberal principles topple
ed: moneyrgrubbing begins.

Well, what are the liberal issues this
week, this year, ior many years? Divest»
merit irom South Africa, designed to
demonstrate active disapproval oi apar~
theid. Environmental Issues — James
Watt and the systematic degradation or
the nation's system oi environmental pro
tection. U 5, supported genocide in El
Salvador. Local and national energy
policy. Disarmament. I can condense
these complex topics even more, into one
single, uniiied concept 7 the preservation
of the earth and its inhabitants, including
hlimankind, and that, Mr. Reid, is in my
own economic self interest I will pursue it
unashamedly, — Laura Jackson

 

 

 

 

(those students who have been asked to
move out do not “have to iind their own
housing" but have the option oi moving
back into dorms or oiicampusi.

What bothers me the most is Ms. Clark's
impervious violation oi personal liberties.
One oi our main concerns was to preserve

‘the privacy oi the members or the house 7

both those involved in the incidents and
those who were not. Coincidentaliy, a story
or. related nature appeared in the same
issue oi the son: some Dibble Hall
residents were charged with breaking into
a iellow student's room. The students in-
volved in this incident were also worried
that “printing the names oi the students
charged with breaking into the rooms”
would open them up to “possible question
ing and abuse." We are reassured in the
5&3'5 editorial that the 8&3 Was ”quite
aware oi that fact and had no intention oi
printing uie students' names"

One wonders why these Dibble students
were aiiorded this courtesy, while the
names oi all oi the members or 1205 Park
appear in the very iirst paragraph oi Ms.
Clark's story (not to mention the picture oi
two oi us “sitting in the living room").

One oi Ms. Clark's moves which par
ticularly disturbs me is the case oi Molly
Melick, Molly had specifically asked not to
he identitied in the article, but Ms. Clark
ignored this request and printed the
relatively incriminating quotation: H ‘I
thought it would be OK to take the stuff,’
Melick said.”

This seems to be in direct violation oi the
5&3'5 “standing policy," adumbrated in
the editorial, “that it will not identify the
names oi the students if that identiﬁcation

could, in any way, hurt those student's .

reputations for the remainder of their time
at Grinnell."

Although I was not one of the house
members involved in this incident, I can
not help but feel that my “reputation" has

been damaged by the article. Since the ar-
ticle appeared, John Hopkins my boss; 1
edit an admissions publication) and
several oi my proiessors have contacted
me, wondering about my involvement in
this iront page scandal.

It was not without hesitation that we
agreed to cooperate with the $513 on ﬂ’ils
story, and I cannot help but ieel betrayed
by the slip-shod, not to mention libelous
manner in which Ms. Clark subsequently
handled the article. Harassing phone calls
irom eager reporters, inaccurate repor-
ting of factual information, inaccurate
reporting of quomtions and an overall lack
of concern for the liberties of the students
(incidentally, sails photographers entered
a student's room without permission, to
photograph one oi the antique chairsi all
add up to the kind of journalism which has
no place in the 8&3. That this irresponsi-

ble journalist should hold a paid office on '

the 8&3 staii is inconceivable.

i agree with the recent Sim editorial 7
the 5&3 can “iunction as a part oi the
campus community and iuiiill its iunction
as an objective news source on campus,"
But it cannot achieve this goal with jourr
nalists who bear out the stereotype put
iorth by Samuel Johnson hack in 1758:

“A newswriter is a man without Virtue,
who writes at home ior is own proiit. To
these compositions is required neither
genius nor knowledge, neither industry nor
sprightliness; but contempt oi shame and
indiiierence to truth are absolutely
necessary.” 7 Eric Rasmussen

The Editor rcplie z I attended the inter
view session mentioned above and ieel I
must clarify some oi Mr. Rasmussen's
points.

One, the “barrage oi badgering phone
calls," while it may he a bit aliterative, is
simply incorrect. Ms. Clark tried to reach

an the members oi the co-op so that, by
talking with all of mem, she could do a
thorough job or reporting. 1 also spoke with
some oi the residents and in no way would
1 term the conversations threatening.

No, the reason that Mr. Rasmussen is
the main source of the story is because he
told us he had no problems with being
quoted. He did, in fact, serve as the main
spokesman because oi this reason.

Three, we deemed the question of “nam-
ing names" in this story a matter oi judg-
ment. Yet, Ms Clark tells me that after I
left the interview session, not only did the
residents give her the names oi the people
living in 1205, but they spelled each name
out for her.

Four, Mr. Rasmussen questions the pic
ture in the living room. There were three
members DI the 5&8 Staff present in the
house. They all agree that those pictured
gave us their consent at the time to shoot
their pictures ior possible use in the sea.

Five, 1 distinctly remember Ms. Melick
giving her consent to being quoted.

I am afraid that Mr. Rasmussen does not
have all of his facts correct in this in-
stance, but ii in tact the 854% did make any
errors, we apologize ior them,

To the Editor:
Re: the 1205 Park furniture scandal.

Grinnell students have once again
asserted that because Mummy and Daddy
have paid Big Bucks to this institution they
ieel that they can consider all campus pro-
perty as theirown to be used and abused as
they see fit, despite minor details like the
law and common sense.

it saddens me that many oi my peers
seem to have little or no sense oi respon~
siblity or integrity ouside that necessary
to fulfill their own desires. a Sincerely,
Rebecca Jenkins

To the Editor:

As a junior with tour final exams, a
biology lab project and an art history
paper all due during final exam week tho,
I Can't start either of the last two things
early), you can imagine my outrage when
I noticed that Grinnell College, in all its
generosity, has decided to grant us only
one buffer day this semester 7

This iact especially angers me when 1
Consider that so many other schools lin-
cluding Harvard and Yale, which our ad-
ministration so iii‘ten compares Grinnell
tot have a full week of buffer days. If in
deed, Grinnell's work load is so light as to
merit (from the administration's point of
viewi only one boiler day, perhaps they
should stop comparing Grinnell to Har»
vard and Yale I, however, see the matter
diiierently. I see it as another shining ex-
ample' of the Grinnell administration's
newly adopted policy oi lack oi considera
tion oi the psychological well~being oi its
students, 7 Sincerely, Cathy Sullivan
