ell, fearless readers, 1 havt' bad news to
on. arr hem, Mr. Coot, was out an a promo
1 tour /or the magazine and I bet youtl
or guess where he was? Ready for this, the
r guy was in Texas. Can you believe that;
'rs probably treating him like a king down
re.
nywoy, [did get to speak to a very friendly,
not too knowledgeable (by his own admis
), ER. person. Paul Engleman, and this is
the had to say.-
, an
)etchiiiger: What is going on here?
’laylmy: They actually only sent ques-
naires to 10 oi the 20 schools, so they
n’t get questionnaires at the other io
lools. [don't know which ones got them,
i have a leeling that they did not send
Lstionnaires to Grinnell
.etchinger: Where in the world did they
their information about Grinnell'.‘
’layboy: Keyin Cook told me that he did
to every campus and did some informal
rviews, I would have to say off hand
t the rating system isn’t very precise
is certainly intended (to be taken)
itly. How can you compare a place like
nnell and the University of Texas
are you've got 40.000 students the ma-
ity of whom are majoring in football 01‘
.erleading'.’ I might add that Indiana

.iion Plan

rvard-in-Lhe-Cornfields will expose one
any niches oi human reality which are
)rly (if at all) represented here, in addlr
n to shedding some interesting light on
innell's position in the great scheme oi
ngs. Further, one is certain to gain
e new perspectives on the value land

University is rated number two, and that's
where he (Kevin Cook) graduated from .
so i wonder it he's not trying to help out his
alma mater.

Letchinger: l-low, out oi the thousand at
colleges and universities in the United
states, did Grinnell get picked?

Playboy: 1 don‘t know what their
criteria was for choosing them (the
schools). 1 think they were trying to get a
sample of schools from all over the coun»
try, and my impression was that orinnell
was one of the distinguished small colleges
in the country. when you are talking about
Grinnell, your not talking about some
place like Slippery Rock or Knox,

Letciiiiiger: I don’t know it you know
this, but in the late ’605 a person from
Playboy came here to speak and some
students protested by taking their clothes
oii during his speech Could that have
anything to do with why we were picked?

Playboy: veah, l have heard about that,
and l wondered if there is any connection
there I'm just not sure about that,

Well, that's about it. 1 was hoptng to bring
you mom "behind the scenes”in/ormoztun, but

plans ior a Phi1./Cheni. double major. and
only by the grace or A P credit will I be
able to graduate with my class And the
creditors oi my student loans think l‘ve
dropped out and are still treating me as a
potential default. Grinnell offers some
alternatives to the Personal Leave Vaca~
tion Plan, including a very impressive
repeloire of ofi'campus study programs.
So the next time you begin to feel vague-
ly meaningless in your Liberal Arts pur-
suits, or get a stiii case of the gotta-get-

i the Editor: ‘
I would like to respond to John “Toot
eel” Kerr's Polumn in the Sept. 3 edition
the Sc - t i ‘iuack Mr Kerr’s piece,
titled ‘hiosl with as,” isa
owe; .ing veraior
mmer Vacalittli m: s \‘A
road to "swallow his pride and work in
rinnell this summer on the Burling

.i. , ,

Library renovations. The really disturbing
parts oi the commentary are Kerr’s
descriptions of his relations with some coa
workers and townspeople.

For example, what follows is his reac
tion to a carpenter, who was sharing an
elevator, asking Kerr is he was reading a
“f“k book,” "I met the challenge: ‘It is
The Doors oi Preccption by Aldous Hux-
ley ' Without a quiver or a blink, l glared
at the poor man until we got oii at our
respective floors.” Kerr, you are a snob
and a buffoon and your attitude is an ex»
ample oi what causes tension between the
students oi this college and the people oi
Grinnell. First of all, the carpenter is
justifiably making iun oi anybody who
would read The Doors of Preception in an
elevator. Secondly, why is the carpenter
judged a “poor man” simply because he
might preier a f“k book to Aldous Huxley,
Personally, a f“k book seems like much-
more appropriate elevator reading
material than The Doors oi Preceptioii.
“Toot Sweet," as his fellow Workers dubbr
ed Kerr, then goes on to atLack the munr
dane diversions that are popular in Grin-
nellsuch as “Cruising” and “hanging out.”
We now get the full picture: John Kerr
does not find the town of Grinnell a
suitable place ior civilized people, like
himself, to live.

Kerr's attitude is evidence oi why many
of the people oi this town have negative
feelings about Grinoell College students,
They see this pompous foreigner, mocking
and ridiculing their home town, as if he
were confident that he knew a better way
oi life We ca give partial blame to people

When God put clothes on Adam and Eve,
his harshest punishment on us was nol the
annoying stabs oi creeping jockey-boxer
shorts No, God'scruelest punishment was
that aiter wearing our clothes we would
have to WASH them

i truly believe that because God knew
that college students would probably sin
the most (no way), he created laundry and
its inevitable hassles just for us. Of course
everyone hates lo do the laundry, but ior
college students the word has received
new meaning and laundry has become
synonymous with hate and disdain

So, you say, housewives do the laundry
every day while We students do it once a

‘. month Well, to this I answer that.
housewives must truly be God's chosen
people because they must pay ior their
sins every day. But for a college student
like me, who could conjure up thousands oi
ways to L "‘ose precious laundry hours,
the idiosy isies oi the spin and rinse
cycles will never stir my imagination.
When i have nightmares, hell is always a
laundry room wnh piles oi dirty clothes.

For returning students. who could target
the laundry mayhem oi the last few years
Just the fact that South Campus had more
washers and dryers and much fewer piece
ple than North Campus made the whole
laundry situation the joke oi the campus.
But of course last year with the Loose Hall
laundry room out oi order Main Hall laun-
dry room soon became the Dibble oi the
South, i did my laundry at vounkers and
with three washers for zoo people, the ii x
15 room became a cave of wet bras, jocks,
and nylons.

This year thigns have changedl No‘

longer will we have to sit on five foot high
stacks oi dirty socks waiting ior a washer
because this summer the college got more
and all new laundry machines what is so
wonderful about our new machines beside
the [act that they work, is that they run on
plastic computer-like chips, Yes, even hell
has computerized. You can buy the plastic
do»hickeys (do they have a name?) at the
book store or the grill, (We always went
there ior quarters anyway, butwhat is fun
ny is that the book store has sold out of
them twice already, I guess people are
hoarding them.) We are given some
reasons ior the change irom quarters:
First, it will cut down on the number of
thefts of quarters from the machines (My
God, how low will those video games peo~
pie go.) Actually, I think thatwe should get
touchstone machines, then we could just
punch out our laundry number and be bill
ed at the end of the month (Butane friend
. pointed out :liat people would steal other
numbers and then we would have to pro-
secute ior laundry ”and, rise second

Sarcastically, Grinnell‘

Joe Neri

reason for the switch over was to inliibit
townspeople from using the cheaper col»
lege machines i [Ind this a little hard to
believe; who the hell in their right minds
would wait around for hours for a washer
in those sweaty rooms with students. filthy
clothes everywhere to save ten cents a
load! (Me either, hell 1 do my laundry in
town.)

i thought that I would try our new
system and even a sarcastic guy like me
iound nothing to complain about; I didn't
have to wait and the machines worked
great. Bravo, Grinnell, you still can pro»
gress after many empirical studies oi the
laundry room situation: you actually saw
that we needed more machines! (The em.
pirical method used was the fact that one
day Mr. Drake's wife's machine broke and
SHE had to bring her laundry to Dibble!)

Actually many great sociological studies
could benefit from man and his laundry.
Just observe one day when you are Waiting
for your shorts to dry There are the semi-
slobs (semi because you will never see real
slobs in the room just smell them iii Class),
they come in and shove three loads of wads
tied up clothes into one machine. The
paranoid washer, who is the most annoy
ing when there are not many machines,
puts one load of clothes into all five
machines in order to preserve them. Then
there is the freshman launderer who buys
all temperature Cheer and thinks he can
wash all his Clothes together (red, blues,
whites) in hot water! (I love psychodelic
clothes ) Truly the most irritating people
are the neat and clean freaks. We have all
seem them down there with their cute little
laundry baskets (i use an apple box), their
new and improved liquid detergent (I use
old and never worked), their Spray-n-
Wash ior stains (these people never have
stains), their bleach it)? the whites (l
wondered why my socks were grey), and
of course their fabric softener for static cl»
ing (it is tough pulling those clinging socks
apart). These people actually measure out
the detergent and put their Clothes on
hangers after they are done Of course the
most foolish launderer is the man on the
make, I mean who would really [all for the
line: “Excuse me but did i lose my jock-
strap in your load." (The implications at
all this of course are too lucid too print.)

But bitch as I may, i guess when we are
all doctors and lawyers we‘ll just send it
out.

Please send me those iunny quirks iorm
the new media: Box 1048. For this week
I'll end by asking you to try to come up
with a name for the Washing machine do
hickeys, ii you think oi something good put
it in my box with your name Until the next
bitch, .
