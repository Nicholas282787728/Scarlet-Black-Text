lege shelled out $40,000 for a new
logo. The $40,000 piece oi art con
sisted of one clover leaf to the left
at a long, rectangular bar, Most
students were mildly irritated by
this action. They felt it was a vast
mistake going (mm a logo with
[our leaves to a logo with one leaf,
and an even bigger mistake paying
$40,000 to make this unpleasant
transition. Now, more than a year
later, we can make a more sound
judgement about the value of the
new logo.

We conducted a survey of this
year’s freshmen, Eighlyrlive per-
cent cited the new logo as “a major
factor in [their] decision to attend
Grmnell.” Nine percent said the
new logo was, “somewhat impor-
tant,” and the remaining 6% said
it, “didn't hurt.H

Freshman Lisa Bell said,
“Reducing the number of leaves on

the logo was a sign oi a humble ad-~.

also responded positively when

asked about the new logo. “The.

new logo is more aesthetically
pleasing," commented ireshman
Arthur Butler.
