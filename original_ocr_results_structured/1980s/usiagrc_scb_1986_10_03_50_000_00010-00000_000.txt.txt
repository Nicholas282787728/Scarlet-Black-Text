lineup considerably over the weekend. it,
"No one all weekend played in an ace

edged in three tiebreakers. Hi. 6-7. 7-5.
“We did have some outstanding efforts
and close games. but we Just fell short in
every case." Hunter noted.

year's team had just enough players to
play a game. and th'dt's only it they all
showed up and were on the field for the
whole game. what'! You say. "That’s not
so tough". Playing a rougher version oi
