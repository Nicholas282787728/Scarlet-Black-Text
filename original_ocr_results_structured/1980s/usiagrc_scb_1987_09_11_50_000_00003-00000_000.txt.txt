our interest in the project was
because of our feeling that it was
really beneﬁcial to our students
to be able to have a family plan-
ning center here. "

He ex lair-ted that when tlte
Family lannin center backed
out from tlle JB 5, the college
rclt “our ori inal goal had been
accomplishe .“

As far as rovidin funding

said that he could not reply ei-
ther wa tmtil he has a written
proposa stating what the goals
of the JBWC were going to be,
what rogranis were going to be
oﬂ‘ere , and what it was they
were asking or the college.

“I haven’t seen that yet, so
l haven’t really said one thing
one way or the other,“ Teder-
man s .

No deadline or time has yet
been fixed ror re-negotialions
between the Advisory Board
and the college.

Tile JBWC Advisory Board
has already completed a list
or programs and services they
envision offering. The group
is currently compiling data to
show the college administration

Center will rovide services not
already avai able at the college.
They are also collecting letters
ofsupport from various students
and student groups.

“In trying to get tllem [Iowa
Family Planning] to Grinnell,
we felt there were a number of

other things that were not or.
fered either on cam us or ill
the community, siici as sell:
defensc courses and certain slips
port groups. We feel that these
are at things we [the .lBWC]
could offer or that we could get
people, in contact with groups
that do oti'er them, such as Do
mestic Violence Alternatives,"
said Cassandra Ewert, strident
lnember o[ the’ Advisory Board
“So basically what the Women's
Center has evolved into is a
source oi these things that are
not ottered in the community
and a resource to get into coils

Kuthryn Kainp, protessor or
anthropulo y and Advisory
Board inem cr, pointed out that
many or the support groups the
center plans to otrer are not
available to college students.

“We are thinking about a sin-
gle parents group, a roup ior
abused partners, [and a group
for the adult children of abusive
parents,” to name a few, liauip
said.

While students could form

community," she said.

lngram stressed that the cen-
ter is not just tor wolrten. “The
self- defense courses could be tor
men; the program {or adult chil-
dren of alcoholics is not only [or
women” . The center is for coli-
cerned people, people concerned
about women's issues"

“We maintain a kind of femi-

students to get many people iu~

hand, will be drawing from the
clitlrc community.

“The support groups will be
strengthened by the differences
in a e and experience of the
mem ers." Kampsaid.

The Advisory Board {or the
JBWC is made up of three
students, a faculty member or
Grinnell college, some stair,
and many townspeople, includ
ing a doctor and a mental-health
counselor. l<anip stressed that
the members include profession-
als in various ﬁelds who know
what is needed tor speciﬁc pro-
grams and whom to contact,

Valerie lugram. Advisory
Board member and student, has
been involved with the Women's
Center movement from its coiir
ception last year.

“Originally, I got involved be
cause oi my concern {or the
lack of adequate health care for
women in Grinnell. As time
went on, the solution came up
to be a combination of the re-
source ceutcr with Iowa Family
Planning. Along with tile medic
cal facilities would be the other
resources," Ingram saidr

KDIC avoids

“biases 0f the
past”

by Trina H. Josephson

The Who sings “Music Must
Change” and so clues KDIC ra-
dio. Members or the produc.
tion stair Wayne scainnn, Marie
O’Neil. and Jeff Beesou have
made several policy (lmnges to
give KDIC a fresh sound.

Last week, students wanting a
radio show applied by blind all»
plicalinn, on which they iden-
tiﬁed themselves by Socinl So
cirrity number rather than by
name.

Why the change? “We wanted
to avoid biases ofthe past,“ snys
scnman. “I had people assum-
ing they could get u show be-
cause trey knew the program
director or- music director. We
wanted to see the type or music
people would play on their show
rather than who they were.”

All applicants wcrc requircd
to supply a specific description
or their proposed program and
list to songs they would be
likely to play. According to
Seumuri, applicants were judged
only upon their program de-
scription and music selections.

half or the 4: nppliennts given

“I don't think that having
it Show in the pusI is ll rear
soir to give someone a show
now,” says senmnn, adding that
KDIC previously has had prob.
lems with disc jockeys who mis-
ﬁlcd or stole albums from the
record library “A lot of the
old disc jockeys are set in their
wuys.” says Seaman.

An additional policy change is
the abolisbrnent or eclectic proe
gramsr “Eclectic pro rams gave
people the opportunity to plny
nuytbiug and everything,” snys
Seaman, who explains that some
students complained of erratic
cliuugcs in music style in a sin.

to Scnmiin, upproximately ﬁve
