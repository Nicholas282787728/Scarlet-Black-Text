Reverend Daniel ogata has been a
Presbyterian minister since 1958 and
has spent the last seven years here at
the First United Presbyterian Church
or Grinnell. But what makes Ogata‘s
story such a compelling one is that, like
many Japanese Americans. during the
Second World War he and hls lamlly
were interned in a "relocation Camp"
ln the western United States.

Wheli you first meet Rev. Ogata you
see a warm, relaxed, casually dressed
man who appears very devoted to his

religion and his proicssion. A man who,
you could guess, takes lite as it comes
and makes the most of it. But when you
begin to talk to him you realize that his
life has not always been this easy and
relaxed.

In 1910, Ogata's rather immigrated to

America to \VDl'k on the Northern
Pacific railroad Like most Immigrants
to the Umled States, he Intended to take
full advantage ol the American Dream
So, alter working and saving ior S|X
years, Ogata's lather and another man
were able [0 purchase 3,000 acres of
swamp land on the San Joaquin
Valley) i‘rom the government at $3 an
acre.

a tire that Ugata said was "in a way a
blesslng" turned the once inlertile
swamp land into very rich soil capable
oi growing anything, and the ogata
family suddenly round themselves own-
ing some oi the iinest rarmland in the
West. "That lire lett the swamp land
with a new layer or ashes. We tried
growing onions at first Alter they
Worked so well we found we could grow
anything," ogata said,

Born in 1919. Ogata was raised works
mg on his lamily's farm near Stockton,
California, where they also owned a
home. He stayed there until his early
teens when his father deClded to send
him to Japan to attend school. "Our
parents wanted their children to be
agvare of both cultures,” Dgata explain-
e .

He attended a college prep school unr
til his parents called him back to the
states in 1938 when the Japanese mVﬂd'
ed China.

"My parents called me back." Ugata
Silld, ‘because they were afraid that I
might get drafted into the Japanese are
my." So ogata returned to the United
States to work on his family’s iarm,

For most Americans old enough to
remember, the morning or December7,
1941 evokes a Vivid memory Everyone
knows where they were when they iirst
heard the news of the bombing 0] Pearl
Harbor by the Japanese, especially
Ogata. That single event ould alter
the course of the rest of his life.

“I was out in the vineyard, i think
pruning. that Sunday morning. We
usually ﬁnished by 10 so that we could
get ready lor church by it," explained
Ogata. We stopped to get gas and the
attendant asked it we were Japanese.
We said yes and then he told us that -as
or today we can't sell you gas—you are
the enemy.

"l couldn't believe it, so we went to
buy a paper and ran into the same no
sale' problem." ogata went on to say,
“We didn‘t hear lor sure until we got
home and turned on the radio.”

ugatu explained that from then on he
and his lamlly were considered "enemy
aliens." They were subject to a curiew
and irom that point on their travel was
restricted to a three mile area. This
was especially a problem lor the
Ogatas since their [arm was it miles
irom their home Ugata explained that
they had to petition the l-‘.B,l. {or per
lnissmn to go to work.

By January oi l942 the rumor that the
Japaiiesenniericans would be moved
was strong, but Ogata said that he real-
ly didn‘t believe it. "I lelt that it was
just a rumor, that it couldn't happen in
a free country '

On February 19, 1942 President
Roosevelt signed Executive tirder sites
which gave the army blanket power to
"deal" with the enemy alien
"problem." The order el‘l'ected 110,000
people el Japanese ancestory within the
western coastal area, But as Ogata
hastens to paint out, many at those
iio,tititi people were children born in the
State; "the kids were American
citizens. '

”We had to get ready to move almost
overnight," Ugata explained. "They
tthe government otllclalsl told us that
we could each take one suitcaseilhal's
all.”

They packed up and were immediate
ly sent to temporary lacilities which
were set up at race tracks and county
lairgrounds where they lived in horse
stalls,

Whlle in the temporary camp ogata's
family heard that their larm had been
robbed. The government had said that
they would hold all the property owned
by the enemy aliens until they returned
lroni the camps, This was an important
point to the Ugalas by-iiov. since they
had a Attract-e vineyard with many
pieces at expensive tal'm machinery.

"\lie padlocked the warehouse,
garage, and house, and “9 also boarded
up the \i'llldoiis,” ogata said. "But
when wecontacted the police about the
{hell they told us that we weren't entitl-
ed to any protection. And one week
