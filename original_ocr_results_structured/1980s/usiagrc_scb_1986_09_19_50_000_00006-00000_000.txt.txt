By Barbara Brown

My! How easy it must be for people who
hold important positions to forget the pier
bians to whom they are responsible. Public
figures are perfect targets for the corrup~
tive influence of that five-lettered
monster. POWER. It is thus with par
ticular joy I take note that our own SGA
President, Edward Amann, has managed
to avoid having his pristine character
sullied by the awesome power with which
he is endowed. He, surely, never will
forget all oi the little people out there who
made it all possible for him.

It does’my heart good to see how Ted
already has taken up the cause of one of
the lessiortunatc among us, Just look how
he is fighting tor Sophie. Sophie, according
to Ted's article in this year's first Scarlet
and Black, “has not had a date for a long
time. Let's try and help her out a bit, 0K
gang?" And, by golly, through what I
assume can have been only some very
hard work on 'the part of our voter-
conscious SGA President, Ted has been
able to report in his second column of the
year that. although Sophie still has not had
a date, “she's had offers." Excuse me
while I wipe a single glistening tear from
my cheeck.

It isvwlth bated breath I now await each
issue of the Scarlet and Black. “Hoping to
read about another drug b‘ust'l” the more
crass among you may be wondering. No
siree; I will taint my eyes with no such sen~
sationalistic journalism What lam hoping
for is another installment of “Sophie‘s
Story." This human-interest aspect of
Ted’s column has grabbed my heart. Hats
off to you. Ted, for your concern for your
public.

1 never have been one to be entirely
original, but I do make an effort to be
honest in my unoriginality. It is, therefore,
inthespirit oi that great man, Ted Amann,
that I present for your unabided sym-
pathy, a pligh _

I have a ” rlend” who is in a position
similar to that of Sophie before‘Ted under-
took her cause. My “friend,” I'll call her
“Barbara," has not had a date in a long
time either. Barbara never used to worry
about this until she started reading
magazines aimed at her age group, It was
through reading these publications that
Barbara discovered that all other females
of her age dated on a regular. if not lie
quent, basis. Barbara started to worry:
Even she knew that four dates in nineteen
years in no way constituted ”frequent," or
even “regular" dating. Barbara used to
think that the world's greatest problem

must bea problem like hunger, poverty, or
perhaps threat of nuclear war; she now
knew that ”datelessness” surpassed all of
these other public concerns. “Good
heavens! ” thought she. “I am not normali
All other people my age date on a regular
basis, and i don't. There must be
something terribly wrong with me.” As
everyone knows, she was right.

l-ask you to keep all of this in mind as!
make the iollowing suggestion: OK, Gang.
Let's try and help out Barbara and all
other datcless outcasts like her out there.

Are any of you inclined to periorming
community service? May 1 suggest as
your next project a drive to “Take Bar-
bara or Someone Like Her, Out On A
Date?” This should make you feel a great
deal better about yourseli, and it might
even do some good for those unfortunate
dateless souls out there.

Do any of you have connections at a ma
jor television network in the U. Use
your inﬂuence to secure twelve to twenty-
four hours of commerciabfree time during
which you can hold a telethon for the
dateless People can call one of the
flashing numbers at the bottom of their
television screens to pledge dates. Those

.kind hearts who pledge three or more

dates may receive. free olcharge, an a x10
glossy of Sophie, the official Poster Child
of the Dateless.

Some of you who have younger brothers
or sisters could organize juniorhigh and
highrschool age children and sponsor ac»
tivities like walkrasthons, bake sales. and
car washes for the dateless. Motivate them
with the reminder that datelessness knows
no bounds of religion, culture, or age; it
can strike anyone at any time. Perhaps
one Of these Children has a brother or
sister afflicted by datelessness and can
render a touching story oi its affect on his
family. .

Only by working to help the dateless of
today can we have any hope of preventing
datelessness in future generations, Rest
assured that all proceeds will go directly to
the aid of the afflicted. Dates go im~
mediately to the dateless, while most of
the money collected will be channeled into
programs providing counseling and sup
port ior parents, siblings, and family peLs
7 those indirect and unwilling victims of
datelessness.

So, if any of you are feeling particularly
charitable at the momen, undo the plight
oi a dateless person. And remember, do
not do it for me. for yourself, or even for
Ted: do it for the dateless.
