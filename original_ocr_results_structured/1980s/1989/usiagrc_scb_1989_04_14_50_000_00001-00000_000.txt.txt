pus before their junior yoar was
tnct with anger and outrage by
many members of tlte campus
community this week. Drake's
tlccision was the impetus for a
public protest Wednesday after»
noon in front of the executive
ofﬁces at Nollen House.

At theprotcst, which attracted
over lOO people from all seg—
ments of the campus community.
Drake explained the reasoning
behind the decision. “We feel
that we need to hold the line on
this policy to ensure the integrity
of our residential system," he
said. The proposed change in the
housing policy would have given
institutionally-married same-sex
couples the same exemption as
wlas offered legally-married eou-

cs.
P Drake said he thought that
instituting the proposed change

Faculty reviews curriculum structure

by May»lee Chai

In a series of three meetings
that began this week, the Execu-
tive Subcommittee for Curricu-
lum Review has resumed discus-
sions with representatives of ev»
cry division in order to gather
faculty opinion and ideas about
the present Grinnell curriculum
and possible changes.

This is the first time the
subcommittee has met with fac-
ulty since last November when
four possible models for curricu-
lum change were discussed. The
first model called for a required
upper-level seminar. interdisci-
plinary in nature, The second re-
quired three courses. on rhetoric,
mathematics. and imagery. The
third model would replace the
present tutorial with two courses.
one in “the cultural heritage
without apology” and the other
on “the critiques and altcrna»
ttves," The fourth proposal was
for a core»distributive curriculum.

“None of the mo ,,

preferred [by the faculty] as writ-
ten," said Sandy Moffett, chair of
the subcommittee. “They were
intended by the committee to be
draft models." However. the up»
per-level seminar model “elicited
more interest and enthusiasm
that: any of the others," Moffett
sat i

Moffett emphasized the pur-
pose of the current meetings was
not to decide upon curricular
changes but rather “to get as
many ideas and reservations and
thoughts as possible" from the
faculty. He hopes the subcom-
mittee will be able to present a
report and possibly a proposal by
the middle of next semester.

in addition to Moffett. the
subcommittee is made up of the
fottr division chairs—Peter Con-
nolly for humanit s, Al Jones
for social studies, Charles Jepscn
for sc tree. and Dec Fairchiltl for
special prograirtsﬁas well as
Dean Charles Duke,

The subcommittee has drawn
fire from SGA Vice-President
Rob Killion for its lack of stu-
dent representation

“I think there were two main
reasons for forming this sub-
committee rather than working
through the Curriculum
Committee." Killion said ”One
is that some respected members
ofthe faculty were serving on the
Executive Council committee and
this would be a way to get them
involved.

"The second reason was to
avoid student involvement
Since there are no students on
Executive Council. there would
be no students on the Executive
Council Subcommittee.“ he said.

In the Institutional Self Sludy
Report (Fall 1988). student in-
volvement on the Curriculum
Committee was criticized by
former Chair of the Faculty Don
A. Smith. He said that the

“l tlttuk that the administra-
tion of this college are intelligent
enough that they could Judge
those exceptions as they ari. "
said Melanie Cooley. it was
Coolcy’s request to live off catn-
pus next year that precipitated the
proposed policy change. Cooley
wanted to be allowed to live off
campus with her female lovcr
once they ’td had an in-
stitutionally-s ctioncd marriage

After Cooley was refused an
exemption antler the existing
policy. Rick Edit, a member of
the Committee on Student Life
(CSL), suggested to the commit~
tee that the policy be changed to
include same-sex marriages. Be-
fore Spring break, both CSL and
Joint Board passed a proposal that
stated “until Iowa recognizes
same-sex marriages, Grinnell
College will recognize institu-
tionally sanctioned marriages of
same-sex couples."
