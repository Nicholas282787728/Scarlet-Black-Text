WOM N REACH 30% OF FACULTY

at Grinnell, there will be a much
larger number of women at the full
professorship level by the 1990’s,“
said Atwell.

Some faculty members say that it
is this advancementthroughtheranks
where any progress should be moni-

. tored.

”Thenumber of faculty atthe lower

levels is hard to take seriously in the

- short term,‘ said Jan Berkowitz-
Gross. associate professor of French
and chair of the Grinnell Women’s
Alliance, a faculty-staff women’s
group.

“It‘s how long we can keep them
in place. One person leaving can
make all the difference in a staLisr
tic," she said.

Not included in the reportare other
statistics which reveal the numberof
women hired each year in relation to

the total number of new faculty
members.

During 1978-79, forexample, ﬁve
women and nine men were hired,
Over the four-year period ending in
1982.36.5percentcfthenewly hired
faculty were women. Thefigures for
1939-90 show 16 women and 15
men hired: over the past three years.
women have made up 44.7 percent
of the newly hired faculty.

The figures show a clear increase
from the period immediately fol-
lowing the 1977 statement.

David Lopatto, chair of the afa
firmative action committee, said the
report could spark reassessment of
the college’s affirmative action goals.

“Twenty-ﬁve percent may have
been a challenge in 1977. but itmay
not be enough for 1989. At what
point do we have to re-evaluate our
goals?" he said.

Deminoffadmits in the report that

the numberof minorities is still low;
there are only three minority admin-
istrators at Grinnell, and three black
and six Asian faculty members. But
he says the college is making efforts
tohire minorities and cites the newly
formed Committee for a Strong
Minority Presence and the Minority
Scholar-in-Residence Program.

There are no Hispanics or Native
Americans on the faculty.

“Our historic focus has been on
the recruitment of blacks. Grinnell
will still maintain this focus, butwe
are broadening our focus to other
minorities as well." college presi-
dent George Drake said.

Deminoff said all departments are
conscious of the affirmative action
policies.

“Depamnent chairs are always
asking abouttheir affirmative action
responsibilities. This is a very aware
campus," he said.

”l was standing in the middle of
my room naked and he opened the
door, turned on the light, looked in
and asked if] knew where this girl in

“I said that Yd give him direc-
tions. closed the door, grabbed a
towel and went out to ask what the
fuck he was doing on campus com»
ing into my room at3 am, but he’d
already left," Wheaton said.

Sophmore Heather Flanagan said
she was sitting on her bed with the
lightsoutwhen“thelights flickedon
and this guy started to walk in. He
saw me sitting there and said, ‘l'm
sorry,’ and just walked out.”

Witnesses described the burglar
as 5 foot 8 inches tall, about 18 years
old. with a medium build, spiked
dark-brown hair and bushy eye-

 

 

 

 

brows. Several students reported
seeing two people but were only
able to describe one well.

The police obtained fingerprints
from beer bottles left by the burglar
in one student’s room. According to
Jones. the police “have a potential
suspectbutthey‘re still trying to get
more information. They stop people
from time to time. .

"They know who likely suspects
might be," Jones said.

Amy Forte was asleep when
someone entered her room.

“I was lyingon my bed and I woke
up because I felt someone touching
me," she said. “Then oneofthe guys
jumped —/there was another guy on
the hallway. They both looked really
panicked and took off running."

Senior Steve Cross woke up Suna
day morning and saw that his door
was open. “I got up to close the door
and noticed that my ID. was outand
fivedollars was missing,"Cross said.

Both the student affairs office and
the police stressed that although
Grinnell is fairly safe students need
to take precautions. Student affairs
issuw a campus-wide memo urging
students to lock their doors.

J onesalso said thatstudents should
questionpeople roaming theirdonns
whom they don‘t know. “Check it
out. Don’t just let people walk
around," Jones said.
