Minority recruiting sparks
lively Open Forum debate

by Laura Moran

On Monday. Feb. 13, the

.szrtdent Government Association

tensored an Open Forum on

tllorlly Recruiting in
conjunction with Black History
Month. The forum was attended
by approximately 40 students.
The panel consisted of Floyd
Akins and Dorothy Palmer from
the Admissions Office; Waldo
Walker, executive vicerpresident;
Steven Jones, associate dean of
Student Affairs; William
Dcminoff, the afﬁmtative-action
officer; and student Pleshette
Hamb. President George Drake
was also in attendance and an-
swered several questions from the
audience.

The ﬁrst panelist to speak
was Akins, who spoke of some
of Grinnell's past successes
concerning minority students.
He went on to say that it is
becoming difficult for colleges to
recruit black and Hispanic

CSL passes

by Kim Eckart

The Committee on Student
Life (CSL) has submitted a
clarified version of SGA Joint
Board's smoking policy to
President George Drake.

The policy designates
particular residence-hall areas as
available for smoking restrictions
and outlines the voting procedure
for those restrictions.

The original policy stated that
a student smoking in a common
area must, if requested, stop
smoking or leave the area. The
new policy clarifies these
common areas, which include
stairwells, bathrooms, kitchens,
and dormitory lounges.
However, an entire dorm can
restrict smoking in the all-dorm-
acccss areas: dorm lounges,
kitchens, and Stairwclls. Persons
living on a floor with an all-
dorm-acccss area cannot decide to
restrict smoking in these areas.

A floor may vote to restrict
smoking in ﬂoor-access areas,
specifically, hullwttys and
bathrooms.

students. Akins noted that there
has been a national decrease in
black enrollment in colleges.
Statistics show a decline of
30,000 black college students
between l980 to 1986 because of
competition from the armed
services, poor educational
facilities for minority students,
poor counseling, "prestigious
overlap" (a term used to refer to
the fact that many prestigious
institutions attempt to recruit a
relatively small number of highly
desirable minority students), and
the fact that more students, pri-
marily blacks. are choosing to
enroll in predominantly black
colleges. However. Grinnell is
managing to continue to increase
its black enrollment yearly
through various programs, This
year the number of inquiries from
black students doubled from last
year’s statistics.

Dcminoff spoke next, also

focusing on the historical aspects
of Grinnell’s minorityrrecruiting
policies, followed by Hamb's
description of her own personal
experience with Grinnell’s
minority policies.

Jones spoke of the need for
Grinttcll to increase the number
of minorities on its staff and
faculty as well as the difficulties
of such a task.

After Jones finished, Palmer
discussed the valuable assets
contributed by minority alumni,
whom she considers to be
“sterling products of a Grinnell
education.“

The last to speak, Walker
concluded by adding some more
historical details about
black/white relations on campus
during the late ‘605 and early
‘705, and by praising the
Speakeasy held two years ago by
black students at Grinnell. Said
Walker, “I have never seen such

revised smoking policy

A petition by 30 percent of
the floor membership is required
before the issue of smoking
restrictions can be brought to the
ﬂoor as a whole for a vote, and
70 percent of the membership
must vote in favor of the re-
striction policy in order for it to
be carried out

Smoking remains prohibited
in elevators and computer areas.

SGA president Greg Evans is
drafting a policy to funher restrict
smoking in the dining halls.
However, “it's difficult to create
separate environments where
smoking would be inoffensive to
non—smokers,” Evans said.

Grinnell’s campus."

After the panelists had
spoken, the floor was opened for
questions. Dianna Ward began
by voicing complaints about the
athletic coaches at Grinnell. She
was followed by a student who
asked why the school placed ads

in Ebony magazine. Akins
responded that the purpose of this
advertising campaign had not
been to recruit actively, but talher
to create awareness about the
college. Another studentraised a
question concerning the minority
recruiting policies of other

Soviet student

robbed in

lana Stashonok. one of the
eight recently arrived Soviet
exchange students, was robbed of
$127 from her room in Dibble
earlier this week. The money
was the remaining portion of
Stashonok's $150 stipend for the
month of February, and the rob—
bery spurred instant response
within the town of Grinncll.

Stashonok suspects that the
robbery occurred between
Saturday afternoon, when she
returned from shopping, and 3
pm. Monday, when she
discovered the theft and called the
police.

College administrators
responded by reimbursing the
stolen money. Steven Jones,
associate dean of Student Affairs,
presented Stashonok with money
from the President‘s Contingency
Fund.

The day after the robbery,
radio station KGRN aired the

Dibble

story. By the end of the day, the
Rotary Club, the Lion's Club,
and the Grinnell Chamber of
Commerce, as well as Brenton
Bank, had begun collections to
reimburse Stashonok. The
college also received calls from
other panics interested in raising
money, but explained to then that
it had already been replaced.

Stashonok expressed surprise
at what she considered a “great
response. She added, "There were
many people who were going to
help me."

At Wednesday night‘s Joint
Board meeting, SGA President
Greg Evans announced the theft.
He urged students to reach out
and get to know the Soviet
students in order to erase the poor
first impression left by the
robbery.

But Siashonok insisted that
the robbery will not "change (tier)
response toward the college."
