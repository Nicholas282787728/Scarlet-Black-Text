Grinnell College

Grinnell Slips in US. News Survey

Grinnell has slipped to number 10
on US. News and World Report‘s
annual list of the best liberal-arts
colleges in the country, down from
number eight a year ago.

Grinnell’s appearance on the list,
highly touted in promoting the col-
lege, marks the fourth consecutive
time the magazine has put Grinnell
College in the top ten.

Grinnell appeared as number nine
in 1985, dropped to number 10 in
1987 and rose to number eight in
1988. The survey was not done in
1986.

The magazine says the country’s
top ten liberal-arts colleges are
Swarthmore, Amherst, Williams,
Pomona, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley.
Smith, Wesleyan University, Ober-
lin and Grinnell. Grinnell is the least
expensive college in the group.

The list, released yesterday, is pan
of a special report on America’s best
colleges in the magazine’s Oct. 10
issue.

The rankings are based on finan-
cial and academic statistics and on a
survey of college presidents and
deans.

SGA Protests Discrimination

says international students may no

cost of off-campus programs.

The resolution, sponsored by An~
drew Sheehy,asophomore from Ire-
land, said that the new policy “is in
clear and blatant opposition" to

icy. Collcge policy says that Grin-

aid."

In the resolution, Joint Board said
it condemns the“change in the Grin-

being discriminatory towards inter-
national students.” SGA urged the
adminisuation to “review and elimie

ately."

No defense of the administration’s
position was given at the meeting,
causing some senators to exprms
concern that there was not enough

Students Support Abortion
and Tuna Boycott in Vote

By Diane Brumley

Two initiatives — one supporting
a woman’s right to have an abortion
and the other asking that college
dining services label tuna as a boy-
cotted item 7 were passed in a stu-
dent referendum Wednesday.

The intiative on abortion, intro
duced by the Politically Active
Feminist Alliance, says G'rinnell
students “believe it is a woman's
right to choose and obtain a safe and
legal abortion" and ‘oppose any
attempt, whether legislative or judi-
cial, to limit or restrict this right."

of the 582 people who voted on

’ the abortion initiative, 480 — or 82

percent of the voters — voted in
favcrofit,Theremaining 102 votes,
or 18 percent of the voters, opposed
it.

Gretchen Landwehr, who headed
the committee that proposed the
initiative, said thatthepassing ofthe
initiative is significant in that “the
majority of the nation is pro-choice,
but all we ever hear about is pro
life."

“It may now be said that as a
campus, we are pro choice," said
Rashmi Dyal-Chand, another mem-
ber of the Politically Active Femi-
nist Alliance,

The inLitiative allows the group to
write letters to public ﬁgures and
organizations with the backing of
the entire student body. The group
plans to send such letters to legisla-

tures in states where abortion rights
are challenged.

Landwehr said that the group will
also be holding several fundraisers
and circulating petitions and pledge
sheets to help raise money to get to a
proeabortion march in Washington,
DC on Nov. 12. The alliance also
plans to show a 30-minute ﬁlm on
abortion sometime after October
break at an allrcampus study break.

The Grinnell Animal Rights Coa-
lition initiative, whichcalled for tuna
served in the dining halls to be la-
beled as a boycotted product, passed
with 386 votes 7 76 percent of the
voters —— in favor, and 122 votes, or
24 percent of the voters, opposed.

The group is calling for a boycott
of tuna products because the nets
used by tuna ﬁshermen trap dol»
phins, which often die as a result

“It is very important for it to be
understood that we aren't trying to
eliminate tuna in the dining halls,"
said Mary Bucholtz, one of the
group's coordinators. “Rather, we
are trying to make an economic and
an educational impact on campus,"
she said.

The group’s goal in passing the
initiative is to haveaprintedsign put
out each time Luna is sewed on the
salad bar or as an entree smting that
the tuna is a boycotted item. The
coalition hopes that students will
become more aware of the situation
and perhaps choose not to eat the
tuna.

 

Responding to criticism of
Grinnell’srecruitmentofminor-
ity faculty by a committee of

faculty members say that the
problem is not Grinnell’s alone.
Lack of minority faculty, they
say, is a nationwide problem with
no immediate solution.

said in September that the lack
of minority faculty at Grinnell is
a major factor influencing re-
cruitment of minority students.

Several faculty members agree
that the decline in die minority
job applicant pool, speciﬁcally
in the number of minorities reA

to the low number of minority
faculty. A recent anicle in The

said that 805 blacks received
