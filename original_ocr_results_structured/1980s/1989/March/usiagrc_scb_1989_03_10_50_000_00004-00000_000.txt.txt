Film and concert booking debated

Continued from Page 1

Films and Concens Committees
more responsible to SGA than
they were before the change, A
non»voting SGA Cabinet mem-
ber is on both committees so that
Joint Board has a direct link to
the committees. Killion said that
the role of Assistant Director of
the Forum Steve Bialek is to
assist the concerts and films
chairs to book events. Bialek also
takes up the slack for the students
when the they do not have time
to devote to booking the events.

Killion emphasized that Den»
tel‘s inﬂuence was not the pri-
mary reason for changing the
structure of the concen and film
selection process. He said, “The
primary reason was simply that
we needed somebody here, in the
office, working with ourﬁlms
and concerts chairs." He added
that “it was simply very hard to
work with Georgia [Dentel]. . . 1’

The new process allows more
direct student access to the
booking process. It is not
possible to have that kind of
contact with Dentel, according to
Killion. One difficulty is that
she rarely comes to campus.
President George Drake said that
he has not seen her personally for
three or four years, although he
said that she could have been on
campus without his knowledge,
In addition, all work with Dentel
must be conducted by telephone,
which Killion said creates many
difficulties, since “if she happens
to be on the phone with some-
body, you're out of luck. If you
need a last»mlnute change and
she’s on ttte phone, you’re out of
luck.“

Strause said that the concerts
chairs have never had signiﬁcant
difficulties in dealing with Den-
tct. He said, “The people who
have to work with her seem not
to have a problem. It’s just these
bureaucrats who are the instiga-
tors of rumors and who have
probably never worked with her
who have a problem." Strause
cited several letters to the editor
in past years from former con-
celns chairs who supported Den-
tc .

Another reason that SGA
made the change was that the or-
ganization felt that Dentel was
paying too much for concerts and

for sound. “We were paying
much more than we should have
been," said Killion. He said that
SGA talked with Kevin Taylor,
the man who is responsible for
training the students who book
ﬁlms and concerts at the Univer-
sity of Iowa. Killion said, “He
laughed quite openly" when he
looked at the prices Dentel had
paid for concerts. “That made us
feel that indeed we were losing
some money that we shouldn't be
losing," said Killian.

Joe Lewis, SGA treasurer,
said in a written statement,
“[O]ur costs this year are signifi-
cantly less because we have more
ﬂexibility with our booking."
He said, “The majority of money
we are saving in the concerts
program is a result of reduced
prices for sound technicians."
According to Lewis. Dentel hired
River Cities Sound to manage
every concert. He said, “As of
February, the 1988-89 sound tech
costs totaled $2950. In the 1987-
88 school year, we had spent
$5,900.“

Strause said that Killion‘s
calculations do not take into ac-
count the quality of concerts and
sound that Dentel had booked.
He said that SGA may be spend-
ing less for sound, but the quality
of the system is significantly
poorer. “Absolutely no emphasis
was placed on the quality of the
sound that was contracted by MS.
Dentel," Strause wrote in a
statement

The only direct comparison
Lewis made between costs under
Dcntel and costs under the new
system is the two Chick Corea
appearances. In 1986, when
Dentel booked events, Chick
Corea was booked for $7,500. In
fall 1988. Chick Corea was
booked for $5,500. The sound
tech cost was $1.000 for each
concert.

Lewis said that SGA has been
able to book more ﬁlms than it
did last year with the same bud-
get. In the 1987-88 academic
year, SGA showed 116 films.
This year SGA has hooked a total
of 174 films. with money left
over for special»interest groups,
Strause wrote. “It is worthwhile
to note that while there have been
more ﬁlms, many have
been shown on a low-quality
VCR. . . . [M]ost films are
shown only once (a change which
accounts for the perceived
increase in attendance), and there
are clearly less alternative films
than before."

Strause has also raised the is-

sue of fairness. In a written
statement, Strause said, “The
bush league handling of the entire
affair is an insult to the woman
who molded Grinnell’s enter-
tainment program as a model for
others across the nation." Killion
said that while Dentcl should be
credited for building the program,
she is now a very difﬁcult person
with whom to work. He said
that the problem of access to her
is one of the most important dif»
ﬁculties.

Killion added that he does not
believe Dentel‘s talents are
unique. “During her 25 years
booking concerts for Grinnell slte
was responsible for booking
some very good concerts. And
I‘m sure whoever we have book-
ing for us in the future. during
the time that they're here, they
will also book some good cone
certs." He added, “If you have a
hell of a lot of money like we do
. . . you can have a good concens
program.”

Killion also said that even
though Dentcl started the pro»
gram, it is time for students to
take control of the films pro-
gram. “Implying that in some
way bringing back Georgia Den-
tcl would improve our films and
concens program implies that it’s
going to improve because she’s
going to have a hand in what
we’re seeing, and that's
unacceptable to us. Whatever we
see has to be selected by students,
by student committees, and that‘s
just a given and it has to be that
way," he said. Killion also noted
that Dentcl is still responsible for
booking events for the Public
Events Committee of the faculty.
In addition, she is responsible for
booking cultural films for Mon-
day and Wednesday evenings.

Strause has also said that the
films and concerts chairs have
brought films and concerts that
are too mainstream and that the
quality of selections has suffered
since the change in Dentel's
position, Killion responded,
“Some people say that they’re
not [as high quality as they used
to be], or that they are not diverse
enough. OK, that’s their opinion
and it's certainly a valid point of
View. Many people are very
happy with the films and concens
program, especially the films
program, and I think that's
backed up by the public informa-
tion survey we took last
semester, The Films Committee
has tried to be especially respon~
sive to what students say in that

Students lead group
to pro-choice rally

by Mary Bucholtz

Grinnell students Carol
Pilgrim and Corey Hardin will
lead a group of 200 protesters to
New York state over spring break
to demonstrate against an anti-
abortion organization in the city
of Binghamton. Pilgrim and
Hardin created the non»violent
protest group, Coalition for
Choice, as a response to the
actions of the religious and
political organization Operation
Rescue, whose members
demonstrate outside of abortion
clinics and try to discourage
patients from terminating their
pregnancies.

According to Pilgrim and
Hardin, Operation Rescue uses
violent and deceitful tactics in its
protests. They charged that
demonstrators “routinely harass
and threaten women“ entering
abortion clinics, and quoted the
organization’s pledge to avoid
“any actions or words that would
appear violent or hateful to those
watching on TV or reading about
it in the newspaper." Hardin also
pointed to a warning in the
Operation Rescue newspaper that
unless abortion is outlawed, the
wrath of God will descend upon
the United States.

Students from several Easrem
universities, including Wesleyan,
Brown, Syracuse, and Cornell.
will participate in the coalition
protest, said Pilgrim. Sltc
estimated that 12 Grinnell
students will make the trip to
New York by car and Stay with
participants in Syracuse, an hour
away from Binghamton.

The coalition will attempt to
blockade Operation Rescue’s
national headquarters in
Binghamton and shut down the

protest action, Hardin said, “we
can‘t have any absolute rules, but
we do strongly recommend that
everyone be arrested." He stated
that such an extreme tactic is
necessary to call attention to the
pro-choice movement, which he
described as “under-reported.”
Repeating Martin Luther King‘s
analogy between civil disobe-
dience and a ﬁre engine that runs
a stoplight in an emergency,
Hardin explained, “There‘s a fire
under women. There’s a fire—a
hostile fire—aimed at women.
So we have to run the red light.
We have to use civil
disobedience."

Although the Coalition for
Choice will disband after the
demonstration, Hardin and
Pilgrim have created the Grinnell
Non-Violent Action Group.
which will continue to focus on
peaceful protest. The group will
fulfill a need that Pilgrim and
Hardin perceive on the Grinnell
campus.

“A very large part of the
progressive movement, and one
that's been focused on at
Grinnell, is the educational aspect
of showing movies and having
speakers come to campus,"
Pilgrim said. “That's an
important part; in fact, it’s an
essential part. But it‘s not the
only pan. There has not been a
group that has taken a more
active role."

Among the plans of the Non-
violent Action Group, said
Hardin, is an all~day workshop
directed by an expert in non-
violent protest techniques.
However, Pilgrim and Hardin said
they have avoided imposing a
