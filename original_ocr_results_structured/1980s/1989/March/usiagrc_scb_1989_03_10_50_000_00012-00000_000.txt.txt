Dan ce Troupe Spring concert preview

by Caroline Brearley

Dance Troupc’s annual spring
Show is Lhis weekend, March 10
and ll, in Roberts Theatre. The
show consists of nine pieces in
different styles, six of them
choreographed by students.

Senior Polly Harvey»

McLachlan choreographed “a
visual and auditory farce" usrng
Mozart’s Eine Kleinc
Nachrmurik. “i want people who
know Mozart to laugh because
it’s so inappropriate,” said
McLachlan. McLachlan’s dance
will be one 01 two using live
mHSIC. The Grinncll College
Clarinet Quartet will perform the
Nachrmrtrik. Members of the
Quarter are Dennis Gerhardstein
Cheryl Ohman, A. Minnie
Alexander, and Dave Ebcrbach.
The quartet is directed by Craig
Olrenak.

Like most of the student
choreographers, this is
McLachlan’s first try at
choreography. Prior Lraining is,
In fact, rare among troupe
members. Students who choose
to choreograph are free to select
music from virtually any source.
Sentcr Amy Hamilton is using a
song from the album Shooting
Rubberbrmdr at the Stars by Edie
Brickcll and the New Bohemians.
Sophomore Michelle Hampton
chose a piece written by Sam
Pcrlman for his electronic music
class with Dance Troupe in mind.
“The piece was originally written

for a short play called Broken
Hearts about three or four years
ago. t expanded it for electronic
music because I liked the ptece
and always wanted to see it as a
dancc,“ Peril-nan said.

Artistic director I3.G,
Vocrtman. like McLachlan, is
employing live music in one of
her pieces. The Grinneil College
Saxophone Quartet, under the
direction of Craig Olzcnak, will
play a ragtime piece, “Something
Doing.” by Scott Joplin and
Scott Hayden. Saxophone Ouarr
to! members are David Fein,
Rebecca Lowenrhal, Geoffrey
Hoops, and Bridget Thomas.
Vocrlman saId that the ragtime
music is “Interesting because the
movemcnt idiotn is so different
from my other two pieces,”

Just as their music choices
varied, so did the students‘
reasons for chorcographing.
Gibbs began with the idea of a
fairy talcr “My original idea was
a combination of ‘Little Red
Riding Hood' and Romeo and
Juliet. But troupe has no men
this semester, and I wanted to
avoid any kind of statement a
dance with two women might
cause, so I chose to choreograph
about a conflict of two dances
styles." Gibbs’s danceL'urle au
L'aulre, is performed by four
women.

I“The Necessity of Passion,”
choreographed by Caroline

Brearley (’89) risks gender
conflicts in her dance, “The
Necessity of Passion.” Although
the dance is about love and the
consequences of love it isn't ex-
plicitly sexual. As love is more
than just romance, the dance
avotds having a man turd woman,
which Brcarlcy felt would cause
the audience to immediately think
“romance.”

Hamilton’s dance
“awmnann” features junior Matt
Weld as a guest performer. Any
strictly male-female dynamic is
brokcn up by the presence of two
women, who finish the dance
together. “Since troupe Is small
this year. we agreed we could
invtte guest pet-formers if we
were sure they could do what we
wanted. I wanted a man In my
dance. so ! asked Mail If he was
interested." Another dance by
Hamilton, “Love Like We Do?"
is based upon pairs, because it
was a concept that interested her.

Dance Troupe concentrates on
modern dance and imagination
Tryouts are held every fall, with
students choosing the new
members. The rehearsals for this
show were studenlrorganizcd,
wi'h two “show-auditell”
sessions held for review of all
dances by the other members and
artistic director B.G. Voertman.

The concert begins at 8 pm.
both Friday and Saturday night
next weekend, March 10 and 11,
in Roberts Theatre.

This 1988 release is the latest
from Roman Polanski (who, you
might recall, ﬂed the United
States in the late 705 after plead-
ing guilty to unlawful sexual' In-
tercourse with a 13- y-ear old
model) It IS a revival of one of
Hitchcock‘s central themes: an
ordinary person suddenly thrust
into a frenzied world of terror and
mystery. In this case that ordi-
nary person is Drt Richard
Walker (Harrison Ford), Ameri-
can heart surgeonr The film
opens with Walker and his wife,
Sondra (Betty Buckley), checking
into a Paris hotel. But soon
Walker’s wife disappears and he
is caught up in a world of in
trigue and violence.
