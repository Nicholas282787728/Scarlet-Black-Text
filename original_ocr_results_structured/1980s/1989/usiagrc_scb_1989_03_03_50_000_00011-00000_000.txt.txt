iTyson on top of the world - all alone

'something all fighters pray to
avoid.

while watching this HBO
feature presentation, I found
myself cheerleading for the
challenger. I wanted Bruno to
knock the 22-year-old champion
senseless. And throw in a couple
of choice words (anti jabs) about
his evil ex, Robin Givens, while
he was til it.

This wasn’t Simply
lollygagging for the underdog.
either. I wholeheartedly wanted
Bruno to emerge victorious, even
though deep down I knew it was
an impossible task.

Why root for the challenger?
Simple: it‘s getting monotonous
,watching Tyson dispose of
opponents as if they were paper
plates. No one who enters the
ring with THE MAN sizes up.
It‘s gotten to the point that
Tyson is the playground bully
.picking on all Lhe little kids in
the sandbox. All I want is a “lair
fight." Trouble is. the sandbox is
empty.

only three men have gone the
distance with him. The rest have
been the unfortunate victims of
knockout. And not just any run-
of-the-mill knockout, mind you.
These are patented. bone-
erushing. firstor second-round
massacres. (Tyson should have
his own NIKE commercial with
“Mars Blackmon" picturing one
of his death»defyin‘ right hooks.
“You can have these: you can't
do this")

As he said after he
successfully defended his title
Saturday, “I wanted to push
Bruno’s nose bone up into his
brain." l-lmm, kinda guy you
want to have over for family
dinner.

The man‘s an animal, plain
and simple. How many boxers
do you know who enter the ring
wearing neither socks nor a robe?
He’s head and shoulders above the
rest of Lhe pack. Tyson deserves
more than his present title of
heavyweight champion. Boxing
officials might as well develop a

SCARLET AND BLACK

“King of the Boxing World" has
a nice ring to it—beeause no one
else is in his league.

But the fact that no one wtll
dethrone him for. ch, 15 to 20
years, is the tragedy of it all.
Sure, it‘s nice to be the best, but
what fun is it when you don‘t
have any viable competition?
Well, I guess the truckloads of
millions don't hurt.

I have to hand it to Bruno for
hanging on (literally) as long as
he did. One day he can tell his
grrindkids about the night he went
too to toe with the legendery
Mike Tyson, who by that time
will be regarded in the same light
as Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis,
Muhammad Ali and the other
boxing immortals. But what
about in the meantime?

When asked alter the “war”
what he was going to do. Tyson
responded—in an obvious (and
cheap) promotion—that he was
going home to see the movie
Lean On Me. And why not? It's
not as if he has anything better to
do with his time.
