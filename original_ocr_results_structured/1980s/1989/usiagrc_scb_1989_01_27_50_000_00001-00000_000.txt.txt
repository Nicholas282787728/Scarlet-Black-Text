Soviets
delayed
in first
exchange

by Beth Wodzinski

In what John Mohan, head of
the Russian department, calls a
“very exciting development,”
eight students of English from
the Soviet Union are scheduled to
arrive at Grinnell to begin a
semester of study,

The students are from the
Herzen Pedagogical Institute in
Leningrad, and are part of what
Mohan hopes is the beginning of
a long-term exchange. Students
from Grinnell have been going to
the Soviet Union for years, but
this is the first time that Soviet
students have come to Grinneli,

The exchange is under the
auspices of the American Council
of Teachers of Russian, which is
also sponsoring the visit of
Russian Professor Sofia
Korchikova, Grinnell has also
participated in the ACM-GLCA
Krasnodar program in Russia,
which was offered for the first
time in 1987-88.

The students are presently
scheduled to arrive on Friday.
Feb 3, Mohan said. Because of
the volume of air trafﬁc between
the Soviet Union and the United
States, they have had difﬁculties
leaving the country. "The big
problem has been getting their
tickets on outbound flights,"
Mohan said. He added that the
Feb. 3 scheduled arrival is
"reasonably furn,"

The students, wllo will "be
coping with formidable academic
and cultural adjustments,”
according to Mohan, will also be
faced with the additional strain of
missing the first two weeks of
classes. They will be
accompanied by a teacher, Viktor
Kabachki, who will act as their
adviser and counselor during the
semester.

Freshman Mira Milar will
share a room with Soviet student
Anna Najshul. Milar, who has
lived in the Soviet Union, is
looking forward to Friday. She
feels that many people have the
wrong idea about the people of
the Soviet Union, judging the
entire country by its officials.
Perhaps this exchange, Milar
said, coming at a “tremendously
crucial period in Soviet history,"
will change American perceptions
of the Soviet Union.
