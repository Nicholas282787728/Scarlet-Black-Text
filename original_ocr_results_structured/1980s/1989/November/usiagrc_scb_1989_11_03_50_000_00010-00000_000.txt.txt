Happy B’day, Pfitsch:
Men’s Soccer Champs

suggest that the situation would be ‘

By George Mclimsey

Money cannot buy the present
which tthrinnellmen’ssoccertcam
presented to Coach John Pfitsch on
his 70th birthday last Saturday.
Conference Championships are one
thing yott can‘t buy at WalaMart,

In a new, four-team format in
Appleton, Wis., the Pioneers shut
outSt.Norbert, 1-0,in the semi-ﬁnal
and did the same to Lawrence, 2-0,
in the final to capture the Midwest
Conference title.

“We peaked at the right time,”
Pfitsch said. ‘The guys were calm
and sustained their intensity through-
outboth games, It was the best binh-
day I’ve ever had.“

In the morning semi that game.
Grinnell squaredoff with St. Norbert
in what was to be a tough, physical
match-up. The Pioneers found them-
selves in a scoreless deadlock, un-
able to gain a signiﬁcant advantage
until mid-way through the first half.

At this point senior goalkeeper
Dave Shane sent a drop kick spine
ning upfield to a waiting Steve
Fairchild who touched a nice pass to
Tony Harris on the right wing. Offa
quick fake, Han'is beat the Norbert
fullback and closed in on the goal
under heavy pressure. l-Ie rocketed
an amazing shot off the Norbert
keeper’s shoulder and into the net,
making the score 170 Grinnell.

Neither team was able to capital»
ize on its scoring opportunities for
the rest of the game, though St.
Norbert very nearly knotted the score
on a second half breakaway. Keeper
Shane however, was at his best,
thwarting the attack and prwerving
victory.

The final versus Lawrence proved
to be a nail-biter. With 15 minutes to
play the scoreboard was blank for
both sides and there was nothing to

changing soon.

At this point, Coach Pfitsch'put
freshman Chang Chae into thegame
at a hallback position to give his
tiring squad some fresh legs. Chae
rose to the occasion — who says

freshmen don‘t react well under

pressure? 7 and knocked in a re-
bounding shot with just under 10
minutes to go.

After his teammates had finished
mobbing him. and after Pfitsch
moved him up to the right wing,
Chae put the bow on the gift by
blasting in his second goal withjust
four minutes left.

When the final seconds ticked off
the clock with Grinnell in the lead 2-
0, Pfitsch looked skyward and
thought, “Lord you can take me now.
What a birthday!”

In retrospect, both Coach Pfitsch
and his players feltthat although this
year’s squad might not have had the
individual talent of past years they
came together as a team unlike any
other,

”This is the best team I‘ve ever
played on," Senior AndyLaing said.
“We held together throughout the
season and gave a great effort at the
end. We also had a lot of fun."

The balance ofthe team is evident
in the season‘s scoring stats, which
show that 13 players contributed to
the season total of 2‘) goals — Ian
Lon'merand Steve Fairchild leading
the way with four apiece. Keeper
Shane spearheaded a defense which
proved nearly invincible down the
stretch and ended his college career
with a .57 goals against percentage.

When you put a balanced scoring
aimckalongsidea rigid defense, and
have a team composed of guys who
enjoy playing together, good things
nsuallyrcsult. In this case,achampi~
ottship.

Women’s Rugby Scores
First Win in 4 Seasons

By Terra L. Geiger

“IfA equals success. than the/or-
muln isA equaIsXplus YpllLS Z X
is work. Yisplcty. Zi: ’hy,’ ‘tnf
again." ~ Albert Einstein

Okay, so maybe Einstein actually
said thatZ equals “keep your mouth
shut," but surely if he had known
anythingabouttheGrinnellwomen’s
rugby team he would have realized
that this is the true formula for suc-
cess.

After four years ol‘ hard work,
ample play — anyone who’s seen
the team at the Bar can attest to this
e and unwavering persistence, the
team brought home its first victory
by defeating Carleton in its final
gameofthefall season byascoreof
8—0.

After traveling to Minnesota and
losing their first game 0-4 to the
Minnesota Menagerie, the team
opened their second game versus
Carleton agressively, immediately
moving the ball up the field, yet
coming up empty-handed.

After being pushed back to the
center of the field, Kate Peterson
broke away from the pack fora long
run up the sideline to score her first
ever “try3‘ Peterson explained her
reason for waiting until this game to
score her first try,

“We partied the night before,”
Peterson said, instead of the night
after, as the team usually does. "Sol
went ahead and scored since I knew
this would be the only time I could
get outofdoing theZulu Warrior,” a
rugby tradition in which a person
must do a sort of striptease dance
after she scores her first try.

The score remained at 470 for the
rest of the first half, as neithc' team
was able to secure another score.

In the second half, the situation
looked dismal for the Grinnell
women, as Carleton drove to the try
line early on. The serum, however,
led by LaraPuglielli and Mary Beth
Diener. was able to deny Carleton a
try, despite numerous attempts.

With seven minutes left to play in
the game, Grinnell received their
second pleasant suprise of the day,
compliments of Peterson. Once
again she was able to break away on
a great run, “trying“ again, to seal
the victory for the team. Peterson
was very modest about her success.

“We played really well," she said.
“It was deﬁnitely a team effort. It
kind of just all came together.“

Puglielli summed up the feelings
of the team after the win, saying,
"After four seasons of coming up
emptyhanded, now we have a Ian-

. gible victory, It‘s awesome!"

 

. Nighthawks

Trounced at
Carthage

By Ian A. Gustafson

The Grinnell College Nighthawks ‘
hockey club suffered two losses last ’
weekend to Carthage College ,
Carthage had already played their
first games and were thus accus-
tomed to the ice. ‘

The series was the first this semes-
ter for the Nighthawks however
Grinnell 5 lineup included captain
Mike Jennings forwards Bill Hoe-
man and Ian Gustafson, goaltender;
Bruce Johnson and neophytes Ann
Hollister and Kate Nassif,

Saturday 5 game was not much of ‘
a contest because of the lack of +
substitutes for Grinnell, Hopes of a ,
victory were quashed when Bill
Hoeman went down in the first pe- ‘
ﬁnd with a wrist injury Mike Jen-
nings scored a hattrick' in the 11- 3
loss.

Sunday‘s game was much closer ‘
as Grinnell was only down 64 in the r
third period before Carthage scored ,
two cheap goals.

Other commendable showings A
included Bruce Johnson’s first ap- '
pearance as goalie for the Night-
hawks. He allowcd only 19 goals
behind a rather inexperienced de—
fense *

With the help ofsome more play» 1
ets this week. Grinnell should [are L
better against the Universityof Iowa.
