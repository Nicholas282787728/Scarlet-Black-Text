College Cancels Ban on Financial Aid
to Foreign Students Studying Abroad

The administration
bows to protests
from international

students and S.G.A.

By Brendan Shepherd

The college administration has
reversed a new policy that would
have prohibited international stu-
dents from using their financial aid
to pay for off-campus programs.

Instead the college will limit aea- .

demic leaves for international stu-
dents to only five per year.

The policy reversal comes after
protess by intemational students and
a Student Government Association
rmolution which urged the college
to “review and eliminate” the “dis»
criminatory” regulation.

The policy. which would have
taken effect during the 1990—91
academic year, was an effon to cope
with the abundance of students re-
questing academic leaves.

In order to cut down on the num»
ber of studentsasking for leaves, the
administration decided to forbid
foreign students from using meir
ﬁnancial aid to pay for an off-cam-
pus program — in effect forbidding
many from going off campus at all.
The college's rationale was that
foreign students were receiving their
international experience right here
in Grinnell.

The college tries to limit the total
number of academic leaves to 150
per year but this year 173 students
will go on off-campus programs. of
the 173, ﬁve are international stu-
dens. .

“For the ﬁrst time in a number of

. years we had more students apply-
ing for academic leave than there
was room, given the quota," said] an
Czechowski, director of off-campus
study. Overcrowding “has never

been an issue" before, he said.

Czechowski said international stu-
dent interest in academic leaves has
also increased.

“In thelastsix oreightyears. there
has usually been aboutone" intema-
tional student studying off campus
per year, he said, “but in the last two
or three~years interest has grown."

The number of international stu-
dents at Grinnell has increased from
62 in 1988789 to 96 this semester.
The administration said it did not
want “low priority" international
students to deny American students
opportunities for offrcampus pro
grams.

“Suddenly, we realized what was
happeningand webegantoquestion
whether it should happen.” college
president George Drake said. “Ini-
tially. we said ‘well. no, it
shouldn‘t’“

“International students are already
studying abroad. Are we going to
restrict the ability of American stu-
dents to have a first foreign study
experience in order to give intemav
tional students asecond foreign study

experience?" Drake said.

“Within the framework ofthe 150
students allowed to study off cam»
pus, international students would
tend to be very low priority,” Drake
said. ‘

James Lincoln,directorofstudent
financial aid, said that all intema-
tional students have half of their
tuition paid by the Grinnell Foreign
Grant and many receive more.

This year the Grinnell Foreign
Grant is $5,712, according to Lin-
coln.

“The basic assistance is half tui-
tion,” Lincoln said. “Some students,
based on longstanding agreements,
Will receive tuition scholarships. For
example, South African students,"
he said.

“We thought it was unique if not
probably highly unusual for the col-
lege to extend its generosity to the
point of bringing international stu~
dents here on scholarship and then
allowing our money to go out to pay
for them to go elsewhere," Drake
said, “It seemed doubly generous,"

Czechowski agreed that econom»
ics was involved.

“There is a cost factor involved,
cenainly, because of the nature of
the aid tltat international students
get,” he said, '

“Basically. it‘sdirectmoney from
the college as opposed to loans or
government grants or other types of
things that areapplicable," Czechow-
ski said.

“It’s different from the aid that
other students get,"he said.

  

 

Happy Hour, Minus Beer

By Sharyn Obsatz

Friday afternoon means happy
hour to many students. But instead
ofgoing to the Bar, some studentsgo
to Des Moines i not to guzzle beer
but to spend a few hours with inner-
city children.

During the Alternative Happy
Hour, coordinated by the Trinity
United Methodist Church in Des
Moines, 15 to 25 Grinnell students
take a break from school to frolic
with3~to15-year-oldchildren.After
the kids and their families eat at the
church’s soup kitchen, the youth
meet with Grinnell students for “fun
night," during which they do crafts.
read books and play games.

One Friday, the Grinnell students
organized a Halloween party com
plete with face-painting, pumpkin
carving and pinatabreaking. Re-
cently, the children came out to
Grinnell and spent a Saturday after
noon at the farm of Roger Bauman,
equipmentmanager at the REC.
For many of the kids from Des
Moines, it was their ﬁrst hay ride.

Cynthia Carver, the program co-
ordinatoratTrinity Church.saidthat
she felt the program provided “Time
out for the kids to forget about prob-
lems at home. ”

Regardless of the activity, students
say, a great time is almost always
guaranteed for both the Grinnell
students and the children. Accord»

ing to participants a relaxed aunosr
phere is an important aspect of the
Happy Hour program.

“We don’tgo in there as saviors to
save them from the people they are
around,“ Dave Rupp said. “We’re
not supposed to be role models, just
pals.“

“We are Just providing an older
friend," Kolh said.

Anotherpurpose of the program is
to expose the Des Moines kids —
and the Grinnell studean as well —
to greater cultural diversity. The
racial tensions of the inner city are
reﬂected in the children's attitudes.
Participantssay it is good for them to
see Grinnell students from different
backgrounds getting along and hav-
ing fun together.

Koth said he sees the program as a
way for Grinnell students to trans-
late their belieis into action, “If you
are committed to helping others and
to social justice, you need to apply
that directly."

Carver explained that the program
also exposes the children to the idea
of going to college. _

“A lot of the kids don’t know
anybody who went to college," she
said.

For both theGrinnell students and
the Des Moines kids who partici~
pate, the Happy Hour program is at
least a way. as Karin Bellomy said,
of “Doing something meaningful
with a Friday night.
