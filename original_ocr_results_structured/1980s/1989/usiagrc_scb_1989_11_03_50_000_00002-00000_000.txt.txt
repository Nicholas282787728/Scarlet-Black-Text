Cesar Chavez9 Sour Grapes

By Steve Pickle

Cwar Chavez, president of the
United Fartn Workers of America,
warned a capacity crowd in Roberts
Theater yeSterday about the dangers
of pesticides, stumped for his grape
boycott and praised Grinnell's lib-
eral heritage,

Chavez, delivering this week’s
Scholars‘ Convocation lecture, at-
tributediocreasednervousdisorders,
liver and kidney diseases, sterility,
miscan-iages, birth defects and even
death to the use of pesticides in
California vineyards. Chavez said
the current boycott — the U.F.W. ’s
54th ——was made necessaryby grape
growers’ unwillingness to do any-
thing to protect workers or warn
consumers aboutpesticides‘ possible
dangers. ~

The United Farm Workers, origir
nally founded as the National Farm
Worker Asociation by Chavez in
l962, has had great success with
previousboycottsdts1974-75 grape
boycottwas honored by an estimated
17 million Americans and ultimately
paved the way for the union to sign
more than 160 contracts with indi»
vidual grape growers.

Chavez said that the current boyr
cott was going “very well,” with
sales of California table grapes off
by about seven percent. He said tltat
the U.F.W. is hoping fora nine to 11
percent decline in sales.

Chavez said that colleges nation-
wide 7 especially in California and
in the Ivy League — have been
supportive of the boycott, and
thanked Grinnell senior Dan Werner
and other students for last year’s
student initiative banning table
grapes in Grinnell’s dining halls.

Chavez singled out Grinnell as a
“specialplace”andsaidthecollege’s
liberal heritage made him eager to
break away ﬁom his normally packed
schedule and come to speak here.

California grape growers have
actively worked against the union’s
boycottChavczaccusedgrapegrow-
ers of “deliberately interfering in

union elections and creating an
atmosphere of fear and intimidation
in the workplace.” Five union
members have been killed in elecr
tion-related violence in the past, The
F.B.I. has reported that at one point.
as many as three sepetate contracts
were out on Chavez’ life.

“I used to travel with as many as
20 bodyguards," Chavez said.

Many lawsuits are pending on
pesticide use and on the unusually
high levels of cancer and birth de-
fects in Califomia‘s Central Valley.
Chavez said that incidents of cancer
are as much as 1,200 percent higher
in the valley than the national aver-
age. And he said the National Acad»
emy of Sciences has reported that
the use of toxic pesticides on farm
products could cause as many as
1.46 million additional cases of
cancer in the near future.

Yet despite the statistics the grape
growers have had considerable suc-
cess in the courtrooms in defeating
suits ﬁled against them. Chavez at-
uibuted theirsuccess to the growers'
ability to raise millions of dollars to
defend themselves and the inexperi-
enceof juries.Theneteffect, Chavez
said, is that “farm worker children
remain canaries for this country‘s
consumers."

“Our children are dying," he said.

State and federal governments are
“failing to live up to their responsi-
bilities,” Chavez said. The l93é
National Labor Act, the country‘s
central piece of labor legislation,
“reallyonlyworkwfortwelveyears"
and has been gutted since the Eisenr
hower administartion. he said.
Chavez said that unions have been
placed at a handicap

“The playing ﬁeld is uneven," he
said. He went on to describe the
Reagan and Bush administration’s
attitudes toward labor laws as “crimi-
nai,"

In order to raise awarness of the
plight of farm laborers artd to dem-
onstrate the U.F.W.’s commitment
to non-violence, Chavez has gone
on a number of hunger strikes. His

Chavez described the first part of the
fast as “physical agony," but said
that it got easier toward the end. He
said his fast was a “heartfelt prayer
for purity and strength.” Chavez,
who Robert Kennedy called “one of
theheroic figuresofour Lime," named
Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Jr.
as his heroes.

Latina Student Group Challenges
Administration On Ethnic Diversity

By Julie Kaster

The Student Organization for
Latinos and Latinos wrote a pro-
posal in October challenging
Grinnell’s administration, trustees
and faculty to fulfill their commit-
ment to a diverse campus with re-
spect to the Latino culture and com-
munity,

The proposal calls for stepping up
the recruitment of minority students
and faculty, incorporating Latina
heritage and issues into the current
curriculum and ensuring ﬁnancial
support to achieve a stronger Latino
presence on campus.

5.0L. called for an expansion in
me ofﬁces of minority admissions
and minority affairs and asked for
more ﬁnancial aid and scholarships
for Latino students, down to helping
students travel to Grinnell fora visit

The group pointed out the com-
plete lack of Latino or Latina faculty
members here —— a further sign, it
said, of the lack of ethnic diversity
on campus.

In the proposal. the group said it
hopes “the college recognizes the
imponance of the afﬁrmative action
guidelines and actively follows
through on its goal by pursuing the

hiring of faculty and administration
whoareLatino/a.”Theproposalalso
called for the college to hire Latino
residential advisors,

5.0L also urged the college to
broaden the curriculum to include
multi-ethnic studies, and said that
classes that probe Latino struggles
and heritage are crucial to campus
diversity.

5.0L. is part of the new Student
Coalition, composed of representa-
tives of Grinnell‘s other ethnic sup-
port groups, including the Intema-
tional Students Organization, the
Concerned Black S tudents group and
SHADES.

“We have segregated ourselves in
the past and we plan to continue
meeting and supponing one another
so that we do not feel segregated,"
said Julie Runk, one of S.O.L.’s
organizers.

S.O.L 's commitment to the Stu-
dent Coalition is shown in the selec—
tivewordingusedthroughoutitspro—
posal. The group made sure to call
for “multi-cultural" i and not just
Latino — representation on campus.

S,0.L. members said they spoke
to people in the ofﬁces of admis-
sions, minority affairs and financial
aid, as well ascollege vicerpresident

Waldo Walker, before drawing up
the proposal. They said they received
support, but were told to direct their
energy toward the policy makers:
the administration, especially the
board of trustees,

Student response to the proposal,
they said, was immediate and posi-
tive. and faculty response was also

‘good.

ButS.O.L. members Tony Weeks
and Julie Runk said they got only a
“lukewarm response” from the trus-
tees. Particularly disturbing, they
said, was a trustee's comment that
the board would not sacrifice the
quality of a Grinnell education for
the incorporation of multi—cultural
classes.

Evidence of the increasing impor-
tance of multi-cultural studies was
shown in the Oct. 16 U.S. News &
World Report in an article entitled
“America‘s Best Colleges." The
report referred to “a trend on Ameri-
cancampusestowardbroadeningthe
cultural and geographic content of
the course of study."

The article praised Williams and
Wellesley colleges — both ranked
among the top five in the country —
for “revamping their curricula to
make multi-cultural studies arequire-
merit."

S.0.L. members said they appre-
ciated the student and faculty sup-
port, but said they are frustrated by
the lukewarm reception given them
by the administration and trustees.

“Thosewhodictate policy seemed
to quietly agree with our proposal,
yet there has been virtually nothing
said or done,” Tony Weeks said.

“I feel the group’s questioning of
the Eurocentric curriculum here at
Grinnell is a positive step towards
creating diversity." said Sandra
Carter of the office of minority af-
fairs, who is S.O.L.'s advisor. “I
support their efforts in challenging
Grinnell’s dedication to diversity in
all areas,” site said.
