N euroses of Manhattan

By Jennifer Mattes

Manhattan is a transition film for
Woody Allen. As his last effort of
the 70‘s, it strikes a balancebetween
the anarchic looniness of his earlier
movies and his increasingly preva~
lent Bergmanesque meditations on
relationships, first evidenced in his
1978 Interiors.

The film features a tableau of
neurotic New York relationships, set
against the evocative strains of Ger»
shwin and the beautifully sculpted
Manhattan skyline. Allen plays a
'I‘.V. sitcom writer, and at the begin
ning of the film he is dating a young
drama student, played by Mariel
Hemingway. His best friend is an
NYUprofessorwhoiscurrentlycon-
ducting an extra-marital ﬂing with a
moody,complicarcdwoman, played
by Diane Keaton in her last. major
appearance in an Allen ﬁlm.

Keaton fills the role perfectly as
an anxiety»ridden, pretentious and
ultimately insecure individual. She
is a vintage Allen character, a neu-
rotic product of modern city ten-
sions who lacks any firm grounding
on whichto assert herself. Herjaded,
urban sophistication clashes with
Hemingway’s wide-eyed youthful
na't'veté. Allen is sharply aware of
the contrast between the two, the
gulf thatseparates Keaton‘s destruc-
tiveness and Hemingway’s unaf»
fected innocence He falls for the
darker qualities in Keaton and com-
mences an affair with her at the
perverse urging of his friend. who
decides to temporarily drop her in

Country and City Collide

By Bill Thompson

This past Tuesday, a reception in
BurlingLibrary marked the opening
of a new and unique exhibition in the
Print and Drawing Study Room
entitled “Diversity and Change:
Images of Country and City in 19th
and 20th Century Art.”The 40 works
shown are the culmination of a
semester-long project completed by
six students in art professor Susan
Strauber‘s class “Fundamentals of
Exhibition Practice."

Students in the class ﬁrst chose
works for the exhibition from the
Permanent Art Collection, but then
went about the long and difﬁcult
process of justifying dieirselections,
organizing them thematically and
finally producing a catalogue. Stur
dents leamedavariety of skills in the
course including procedures for
handling artwork, print identiﬁca-
lion, visual analysis, and of course
they mastered the subject of the
exhibition—changesin the city and
country reﬂected in the art of the
period.

The 19th and 20th centuries witr
nessed the dual phenomena of fast-

order to save his marriage. The situ~
ation evolves into more hurtful,
complex levels. until Allen comes to
some basic realizations regarding re-
lationships at the film’s conclusion.

Manhattan operates on several
levels at once. It is an indicurtentof
the vacuous selfishness which in»
fects modern relationships. How-
ever, Allen manages to reveal the
many flaws and shortcomings of his
characters withoutjudging them too
harshly. Meryl Streep provides a

As with StardustMemort‘erZelig.
and Broadway Danny Rose, Allen
chose to shoot Manhattan in black
and white. The resulting long takes
of the urban cityscape arc wonder-
ful, as Allen‘s camera glides across
the majestic Skyscrapers of New
York. It is his poetic tribute to the
city he loves, as was Gershwin’s
“Rhapsody in Blue," which is apl

ration. Naturally, the art of this pe-
riod mirrored these trends and
“Diversity and Change" has been
expertly organized to demonstrate
the effect these changeshad on soci-
ety. Themes within the exhibition
include the evolution ofthe city, the
American landscape, city life, rural
life,where we live, and the world we
have created.

In the exhibition, works by such
American greats as Grant Wood,
Thomas Hart Benton and James
McNeillWhistlermay be seen along
with pieces by some of the masters
of 19thrcentury Europe, such as J.
M. W. Turner and Jean-Francois
Millet. Millet’s “Men Turning the
Soil" is in fact one of the jewels in
the college’s collection, and is a
superb example of 19thrcentury
Realism’s concern with the com»
mon laborer.
