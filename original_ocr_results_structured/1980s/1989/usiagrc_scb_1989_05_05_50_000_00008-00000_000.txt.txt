Locke claims his
message about gays
was misunderstood

To the editor:

Judging by Matthew Maclio‘s
response and the heading the S and
B gave my letter I can see thatI
failed to make myself understood.
Iwilltryloconciselyexprcssmyself
again and do so as briefly as pos
sible (I feel that I am beginning to
flog a dead horse).

To draw a cmde analogy to il-
lustrate this situation, let us supr
pose that I am a motorcyclist. I
enjoy peacefully cmising through
the streets of Wooster, Ohio,
dressed as a stereotypical biker with
boots, chains, a leather jacket and
jeans. Due to prejudice against
motorcyclists, the city of Wooster
passes a ban upon the operation of
motorcycles within the city limits.
I wish to appear before the city
council to appeal my case in order
to convince the city to repeal their
law and to protect me from harass
ment by both the law and hostile
locals. IfI wish to be taken seri-
ously, I would be well—advised lo
“speakIheirlanguage”:1mustdress
thepartota politician with ajacket,
shirt. tie, and dress shoes in addi-
liontoarguingasapolilicianwould.
Iean certainly stand before the city
council in boots Lind chains loplead
ltly case but that would only serve
to play upon their worst fears. A
political forum is not an appropri
ate place or time for Sclfrexprcsr
sion; it is a time to win support.

I do not fora moment think that
the gay community will benefit by
fragmentingtisetfintovarious sub-
groups. Idotltink thaisoinegroups
withinthegaycommunily aremore
ttkelytocausc popularoutrage titan

others. To draw upon my analogy
again,slipposethelocalbikers have
a “bikenprlde” event where they
meet the town folk face to face.
Though~their usual dress does not
consist ofjackcLs and ties, such an
appearance can make a critical dif-
ferencc in altering people’s views.
As I see it, the gay-pride parade in
Houston did effectively make a
political statement although the
parade wasofficially notapolitical
event. If Indeed only 20 percent of
that parade appeared “abnormal"
the focus of the media upon that 20
percent merely substantiates my
point. That 20 percent could have
been the crucial factor in the wide
spread opposition that soon folr
lowed. Itwasthat20percentwhich
was seen by perhaps a hundred
million people.

I can imagine the frustration of
homosexuals in their alienated si~
lcnce. I can understand their wish
to express themselves. I feel,
however. that Matt Macho’s view-
potnl, though an understandable
one, places the ox before the wagon.
One must first cultivate political
support and become a functional
portion of the existing political
system. Only then shotildonebegin
to express oneself freely within a
political context, and even then it
should be done with forethought to
what the popular reaction will be.
Ifthe gay community mixes unfet-
lcred sclfvexprcssion with political
activism, I still think the gayrrights
movementwillbeshoolingiLselfin
the foot. Jonathan Locke

Student blasts S and B gag
article about Mike Kent hoax

To the editor:

After reading the sercalled gag
edition oi the S and B, I couldn’t
help but think lhatI had just witr
nesscd the most blamrlt display of
unprofessional journalism ever to
appear in our campus newspaper.
The ad hominem attack, notso clev»
erly disguised as a “joke,” that the
S andB staffdirectc/d toward Mike
Kent was unwarranted, malicious,
andanabuseoftherighttofreodom
of the press.

But it was just a joke, you say,
what‘s the harm? The harm lies in
the fact that the staffofthe S andB
has used its position to discrimi-
nate against Mike Kent—I ﬁnd it a
little difficult to believe that
“Against the Grain" was kept out
of printfivetimes this semesterjust
because of a lack of space. Five
times isjust too often to be coinci-
dental. And now that Mr. Kenihas
effectively been prevented from
having any of his opinions printed
in the S andB, anyonemay publish
ad hominem attacks against him
with no fearofrebuttal. This sortof
attack isbad enough when done by
any student, but one would expect
the staff members of a newspaper,
even acampus publication, to keep
their biases out of the decision-
making processand to exhibilsome
professionalism when making their

own contributions to the paper. It
will be interesting to see if Mike
will be allowed to publicly respond
tolastweek‘s“joke,“oriftheSand
B's policy ofdiscrimination (cenr
sorship) wrll continue.

How can such a discriminatory
attitude exist among a student body
that claims to be so accepting and
open-minded? When did we stop
believing thateveryone has the right
to his own opinion? If you don’t
like his column, don’t read it, but
don’t deny him the right to express
what he believes, and to say it in
our (supposedly) unbiased little
publication. The fact. that Mike
Kent’s opinions don't ﬁt into the
liberalstereotypethatisworshipped
on this campus doesn’t mean Lhat
the slaffoftheSandB should try to
“protect" the suidenr body from
exposure to them. Angela Glover

Editor’s Note: Contrary to what
Ms. Glover may believe, the Scar-
let andBluck has no“policy ofdis-
crimination (censorship)." It is a
fact of life in the newspaper busi-
ness that not everything can be
printed every week. This is “pe-
cially true for a studentpublication
working onzllimited budget. There»
fore it is necessary for the editor of
the newspaper to decide what to

Davis says 3 & B is "slow

To the editor:

I for one would like to applaud
the recent decision of the S and B
staff to discontinue Mike Kent‘s
column. After all, what are we
trying to do here at Grinnell Col-
lege, promote discussion on conr
trovcrsial topics? Don'tbe silly,of
course not! We KNOW our “tib—
eral” views are correct, so obvi-
ously we should ostracize anyone
who expresses anything different.

Hopefully the expertjudgement of
our school newspaper’s staff will
be able to return the oldeslnewspar
per westofthe Mississippi to what
it once was and what the letters 3
and B really stand for, the Slow and
Boring. As our upperclassrnen m,
call, this is the type of newspaper
students only take to cut out the
Pag’s Sl—off coupon. Dave Davis

printand what not to. This is a dif-
ficult task, and one which is impos-
sible to do without disappointing at
least one writer.

We regret that Ms. Glover and
anyone else sharing her feelings
were upset when “Against the
Grain” was held. However, Ms.
Glover is wrong when she specu—
tales about the S and B‘s motives
for doing so. When Mike Kent's
columns have been cut, it has not
been because of a personal dislike
for him or in any attempt to “pro-
tect" the student body. We have
printed “Against the Grain” a total
of 15 times in the last year, far more
than any other columnist. But we
have also cut his column ocassionr
ally,aswehavedonewithIim Dun-
can, Todd Francis, Matt Macho.
Greg Evans and Rob Killion, and
others.

As for Ms Glover‘s criticism of
ourjokeissue, we are sorry that she
did not find the “confession“ about
MikeKenthumorous. Itwasourat»
temptlo take a whimsical approach
toanissuewhichhasbeenthesource
of so much controversy during this
past year. Our hope was that it
would make people laugh, make
them smile, and help them take a
brighter outlook on the day as the
doom and gloom of finals week
nears.

and‘boring"

Editor’s Note: The Scarlet and
Black never made any decision to
discontinue Mike Kent‘s column.
The comment made on page 2 of
the“gag" inserlin laslwcek‘s paper
(under the heading “We are Mike
Kent") that “we stop the columns
now so we don‘t do any more
harm...“ was another aspect ofthe
“gag" section. We apologize for
anyconfusionthismayhaveeaused.
