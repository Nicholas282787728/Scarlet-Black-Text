Men: Can’t Live With ”Em, Can’t Shoot "Em Pure and Simple, an Incredibly

 

To the Editor:

As a new member of the Grinnell
faculty and a participant in the
Women and Gender Studies con-
centration, I must confess thatI was
disturbed by the content of last
week‘s letter, “Ms. Goodwrench,
Meet Ms. Coffee.” Not because it
was so “radical.” On the contrary, I
was disturbed by how conservative
and oldvfashioned it was, I was
concerned to find young women
espousing thesinglemostregressive
theory in gender politics: the notion
that biology is destinyi

In a few pithy phrases (and with-
out. I fur, understanding what they
were saying) these women joined
therartksofWilliamAlcott,Sigmund
Freud and the Catholic Church in
arguing that women are the way they
are because of their genitals. More
over, they centered that principle in
a Victorian context in order to argue
that female biology makes all women
naturally kind and moral and righta
eous. In a world monopolized by
uteruses there would be no more
injustice, exploitation, hierarchy or
war.

Arguments such as these need to
be recognized for exactly what they
are: another form of expolitation of
the female body to gain an advan-
tage in sexual politics, to justify
repression of men,andtodeny female
individuality and thus female hu-
manity. I feel quite cenain that none
of this was the authors’ intent.

But intent is not the point, The
point is that ideas have consequences
and if ideas are not rigorously exam-
ined they will have unintended con-
sequences. In this case, we need to
remember that every time we sup-
port the notion that biology makes
all women kind and moral and right-

eous we lend support to the basic
asumptions of those who say it is
biology thatmakes all women fickle
and flighty and stupid Indeed,
whenever women in the past have
used their biology to make political
gains their arguments have come
back to entrap them. I shudder to
think whatwill happen if women use
that biological boomerang as a
weapon again.

As a veteran of my share of pot-
lucks, I certainly sympathize with
the desire to vent frustration over
some men’s hostility orindifference
to sexual inequality in our societyrl
also sympathize with the desire to
fantasize quick and easy solutions to
the teduim and tenor of sexism.

When it Comes to

Butthe businesswe‘reaboutis too
serious and too difficult for this sort
of self »indul gencer There is no quick
and easy solution to sexism, There is
no biological fix. This is a cultural
problem with only cultural solutions,
and cultural solutions take a notori-
ously long time.

So we might as well just stop the
fantasies and get down to the serious
work of learning to live together
peaceably.Otherwise,pau-iarchywill
have its final victory; it will have
taught women, as it has taughtmen,
to oppress other human beings in the
name of biological superiority.

Tom, Dick and

Harry, the Operative Word is Dick

 

To the Editor:

The campus is aflutter with talk of
the irrational Ms. Goodwrench, Ms.
Coffee and Ms. Clean. It is not thatl
cannotfollow some of the very sound
reasoning that shows its face in the
article— almosteveryonewillagree
that the extinction of men would
lead to more Rice Crispy treats. But
when it comes to eliminating every
Tom, Dick and Harry, the operative
term becomes Dick, and let’s face it,
girls, some of us like it.

Most of the authors’ sexist re-
marks dealt less with sex than with
stereotypes. The sad partis, byblamr
ing men for their problems, these
strong women have madethemselves
appear to be the weaker sex. They
havelaidtheclaimthatsome women
would have higher self-esteem with»
out men, but those women whose
self»worth is based on something

besides themselves will not leta lack
of men ruin their perfectly good
misery.

While I can see the benefits ofa
man-less world (Bruce Willis de-
serves to die), reality has dealt the
edict that ifyou cut offthe head ofa
Phil Donahue, a Sallylesse Raphael
will grow back in its place. Behind
every bottle of Polo, there is an even
cheaper bottle of Charlie waiting in
the wings.

I don’t know. I ‘m not really into
potluck. And I don’t own a pair of
Birkenstocks. Maybe that has some-
thing to do with it. It’sjustthatifthe
only way women can emerge as a
strong, confident and comfortable
body is to destroy all outside forces,
then it seems that the problem is
manifest within the body itself

I hope that is not the case.

Offensive and Hurtful Bad Joke

 

To the Editor:

The last issue of the S & B con-
tained a letter to the editor that we
found incredibly offensive regard—
less of whether or not the authors
intendeditasajoke.lnstcad of being
clever or witty, the letter was a bad
joke that compares to racial and
ethnic jokes that most people at
Grinnell would never tolerate,

The authors implied that all men
are inherently bad while all women
are inherently good. Ifall women are
inherently good, then why are these
five womyn stereotyping?

The five womyn target a group in
their article, but should know better
because they have been targeted

themselves. As women/womyn, if
we don’t want to be thought of as
baby machines, we should not think
of men as walking sperm banks.
The authors also make the rash as-
sumption thatall women/womynare
latent lesbians. This is not only inac-
curate, but denies straight women
the freedom to love whom they love.
We feel strongly that no one can be
equal unless everyone is equal; in-
cludin g straight women and men.
We realize that the intentions of the
letter were not malicious, yet we
were hurt, our friends were hurt, and
we had to respond.

Equality — Not Alienation

 

To the Editor:

The September 22 issue of The
Scarlet and Black contained a letter
to the editor from several women
(yes, I spell it mis way intention-
ally). This letter reportsanew scien-
tific discovery: eggs can fenilize
eggs, eliminating the need for men

I have given this matter serious
thought. Are women better thenmen?
I came to this conclusion: women
are not better than men, merely dif»

ferent. -
One thing that I can agree upon is
that thereneeds tobecomplcteequal-
ity between the genders in our soci-
ety. This is not even remotely sug-
gested in the aforementioned letter.
Instead of antagonizing and alienat-
ing the male gender, the letter Writ:
ers should have suggested some way
to improve relations between men
and women

Some Wacky, Whimsical Myn

 

To the Editor:

While sitting around enjoying a
wacky, whimsical, myn‘s conversa-
tion, we were elated to find that if
there were only womyn, then there
would be "no more stereotypes.”

Yes, there are no womyn sexists,
racists or supremaciss.

 

The Crux of the Non—Issue: Cuts

‘Blatant and Mindless Drivel7

 

To the Editor:

I liked iL No, I really did.

No doubt my voice is a small one
on campus. No doubt the campus is
in an uproar over the opinions ex'
pressedlastweekdecryingtheinjusr
tice of a male-dominated world. No
doubtalotof people, men and women
alike, are over-reacting. Never un-
derestimate the Grinnell mind's
ability to take the most minor threat
to its sensibilities a mile too seri-
ously. After all, ill-thought-out gut
reaction is the essence of any good
campus rag. Or newspaper, for that
matter,

And guts are the crux of this non-
issue. Once (or if) people get past
their initial What a bunch ofbitches
reaction, they will see this is perhaps
one of the best—written pieces to be
printed in the S St B in some time.

Granted, the logic used wouldn’t
help you a whole lot in anything
morechallenging than theIowastate
lottery, but this is hardly a logical
situation we are dealing with. What
Dianna Ward and her cohorts did

was no less than elicit, ifonly for the
moment, the the exact feelings and
frustrations they experience every
day, I mean, it really doesn’t matter
if every man you meet is Fred Ro-
gers if you are Still making only 52
cents to his dollar.

Of course a world without men
would not mean an end to injustice
in theworld. Butitwould be hard for
one to imagine it being any worse.

Besides, if a world with no men
means a world ofmorepotlucks, I’m
pretty sure I wouldn’t want to be

there. MARK BAUMANN

Indeed, the oppressive views of
Phyllis Schlaffley, Joan Rivers and
Tipper Gore would vanish in a puff
of liberation. Oppressive patriarchs
like Jesse Jackson, Peter Singer,
Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu and
