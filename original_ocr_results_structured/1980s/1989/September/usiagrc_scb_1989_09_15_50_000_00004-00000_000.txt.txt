Historian Gay Criticizes
Conservative Backlash

By Steve Pickle

“Very unfonunate” was how Yale
historian Peter Gay, this week’s
convocation speaker, described the
conservative backlash now under-
way at colleges and universities
nationwide.

Gay, who spoke in Herrick Chapel
yesterday as pan of the Rosenﬂeld
symposium on the legacy of the
French Revolution, said that the ideas
spawned by author Alan Bloom and
fonnerEducation SecretaryWilliam
Bennett come from people who have
“never gotten over the late Sixties."

“An authoritarian view of ‘the
great hooks,’ wherein everybody is
forced to read them, is inappropri~
ate,“ Gay said, refen-ing to the re-
emergence of Weslem civilization
course requirements that have been
introduced at many colleges. But
Gay said the “great books” are
“valuable parts of our mental fumir
ture.”

‘The' ‘great books’ are not every,
thing. but rather a part of becoming

educated,” Gay said.

He also spoke about the reimer-
gence of conservative ultra-nation-
alists in Europe, referring speciﬁ-
cally to the French right wing politi-
cian Le Pen. Gay noted that there is
a “certain kind of endemic discon-
tent" on issues regarding race and
immigration which has crystallized
On a variety of problems both in
France and in Europe." Gay attrib-
uted the rise in popular support for
anti-immigration candidates like Le
Pen to whathe tenned“amuchlarger
sense of helplessness.“

He added however that the current
integration of Europe under the
common market was a victory of
sorts for the ideas of the Enlightene
ment. Gay said he expected “tense,
pitched battles on single issues,” as
the European Community moved
closer, but that the process would
have been seen as inevitable by fig-
ures like David Hume.

“These people were not patriots,”
said Gay, referring to the thinkers of
the Enlightenment.

A Generation of Shame

Afew weeks ago, Woodstock was
all the rage. Hippies of all ages took
time out to reminisce about the
crowning achievement of a genera
tion. Woodstock was it, the zenith of
the era of the counter-culture.

Well. [and nota few ofmy
acquaintances grew very tired
veryquieklyofhearingabout
the good old days ofthe Sixr
ties. The whole Woodstock
remembrance caused me to
reflect on just exactly what
the Sixties represented to our
country,and whateffectthey
had on our culture, The more
I thought, the more I found I ~
disliked about thehippies and
their ilk. Presented for you
here, although many are sure
to call it blasphemy, are my
reﬂections on what the Six-
ties have given us.

Seeing as how the hippies
of the Sixties were mostly of
college age, I think an appropriate
analogy for what hasbecome known
as the “me" generation is “the gen-
eration that never grew up." Aldous
Huxley. in his book Brave New
World, very eloquently describes
what he calls the “infantile need for
the spontaneous gratification of
impulses." Look, forexample atwhat
the hippies have given our country
in terms of drugs and sexual promis»
cuity. Sure, back then, doing drugs
was a cool way to explore alternate
realities and rebel against theEstab»
lishment. Many Bohemians were
“turned on" to drugs, and subse-
quently drugs found a place in our
society like they had never before
known. A just look at the wonderful
effects this has had on us to this day.
Drug abuseatepidemic levels. Drug-
related crime skyrocketing. High
school kids whose productive life is

ended far short of their potential due
to early exposure to drugs. But hey,
let’s all just do our own thing, right?

look at sexual promiscuity. The
hippies so courageously defied the
Establishment‘s silly rules about

abstinence. Why everybody should
be able to experience the full enjoy-
ment of their body, without silly
thingslikemarriage. You don’teven
have to love your partner as long as

both of you enjoy the act. Exult in
the ﬂesh. Just look at where this
great notion has gotten us. Teen
pregnancy for one in five female
teenagers. Abortions to the tune of
4,000 a day. VD epidemics. You
won‘t find any hippies who will take
the blame for this though — it isn’t
the fault of the infantile culture but
rather of “those puritanical parents
who don’t teach their ll-year—olds
about birth control.” Well, at least a
few hippie egos were saved.

Perhaps the moststriking paradox
of all is that those hippies of the
Sixties went on to become the yup-
piesoftheeightiesThosesamefolks
who drove out to picket an oil refine
cry because of their concern for the
environment have ﬁlled our
ground with disposable
diapers because washing
diapers is so yucky.

The political affiliation
of the Bohemians has al»
ways been sort of contra»
dictory also. How many
hippies now are die-hard
Democrats? Are these the
same people who burned
all those buildings to pro
test the Viet Nam War?
Could they have so quickly
forgotten that it was a
Democrat (Johnson) who
got us into Viet Nam and a
Republican (Nixon) who
got us out? I don’t know.

But wait, you say. what about all
the social progress that we made
during that era? Why heck, I think
everyone will agree that the Sixties
ended discrimination and that the
hippie goal Of economic equality
was met as well. l-lar de har har.

Perhaps the problem was that the
hippies’ preoccupation with the
immediate (if superficial) solutions
to social problems (quotas, affirma-
tive action, welfare) caused them to
ignore the real solutions (improved
education, greater competitiveness
in job market, work training) be
cause the real solutions would take
some time to implement and hippies
didn‘t want to wait for anything.
Hippies wanted to feel good about
solving a problem right now, even if

The Berlin Wall — Now Superfluous?

In a move reﬂecting Hungary’s
new policy yardstick f “the obser-
vance of human and civil rights" 7
officials there have suspended an
agreement with East Germany as
suring the return of any ﬂeeing East
Germans. As a result. the 60,000
East Germans visiting Hungary
during this holiday season arethreat-
ening to tuml-lungary into a refugee
camp

The Austrian border, no longer as
closely monitored by Hungarian
forces, is providing a tempting ille-
gal gateway to the West for discon-
tented East Germans. The Hungar-
ian govemmenthad notforeseen the
waves ofEast Germans who arrived
for summer holiday. and was led by
the sheer number of visitors to de»
vclop anad hoc solution: thcyopcned
the Austrian border to EastGermans,
more than 8,000 of whom have left
for the West.

Some authorities claim that as
many as 40,000 more could follow;

roughly 6,500 East Germans have

entered Hungary since the policy

change was made known Sunday.
The whole process has been sim-

plified by a number ofWesIGcrman
policies which make emigration
almost hassle-free for ﬂeeing East
Germans: upon entrance to Austria
they receiveWest German passports,
free transportation to Passau. Bavr
aria, and spcetal autoservices for the
finicky East German cars. Under the
West German constitution, East
German immigants are given full
Gennan citizenship rights, includ—
ing health care, unemployment in-
surance, a generous housing sub-

sidy, a furniture subsidy for new
arrivals and $135 in pocket money.

The warm acceptance of the East
Germans stems from thefactthat the
two Gennanys are not two separate
peoples: the arbitrary line dividing
the countries does not represent a
cultural break. The West German
constitution therefore does not rec-
ognize the division of Germany and
provides for those ethnic Germans
on both sides of the Iron Curtain.

Questionsare arisingastowhether
the economic burden of the refugees
will lead to alterations in policy, but
German economic planning will,
likely speed the integration of the
new arrivals into the workplace.
Becauseof family links and a shared
history between West and East Ger»
mans, public reaction to the inﬂux
has been largely favorable.
