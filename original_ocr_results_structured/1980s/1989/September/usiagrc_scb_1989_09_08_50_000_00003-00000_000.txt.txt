By Georgia Dcntel

For over twelve years, Max von
Sydow was the principal actor in
SwedishdirectorlngmarBergman’s
world-famous repertory company,
portraying largely heroic characters
such as the medieval knight who
plays chess with Death in The Sev-
enth Seal,

Since Bergman’s retirement, von
Sydow, who is in demand by direc-
tors throughout the world, has con-
tinued Io act but has had trouble

Exhibit: ‘What We Like’

By Andrew Hamilton

Three distinctive yet remarkably
cohesive styles have come together
in this year’s opening Terrace Gal—
lery art show,

Works by Trini Campbell, 1, Car-

 

the Iowa Composers Forum Festival
Choir, directed by John Stuhr-Rom-
mereim, lecturer of music and direc-
tor of choral music at Grinncll. The
ICF Festival Choir will will perform
S unday at noon in Herrick Chapel. A
sampling of the sometimes-humor-
ous choral score includes Leon Jo~
seph Cardinal Suenens’ “Ecclesias-
tes 13 ,“whichbegins,“Lord, giveus

is day- our daily opinion and for-

. L‘give us the one we had yesterday. "

Schroeder says the festival is de-
signed to encourage creative new

the past year, however, he found,
ﬁnally,aclassicroleintheﬁlmPelIe

official entry won both the Palme

Cannes Film Festival and the 1989
Academy Award [or Best Foreign

sophisticated hero of the Swedish
cinema. Von Sydow, however,
down-played his achievement, say—

styles in music. In addition, Schroe-
der hopes that ties between the col-
lege and the city of Grinnell may be
strengthened by the overlapping
festival events.

The Iowa Composers Forum is a
non-proﬁt organization, Founded in
1987. its goal is to promote new
music-making in Iowa. The Fomm
encompasses all musical styles. and
its members includeeducalors, busi-
ness professionals, community
members and other music enthusi-

ing, “It‘s a wonderful feeling to get
a really good story, a really wonder-
ful part, and good dialogue, which
deals with interesting human ques-
tions,"

Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles
Times probably summed-up critical
opinion best when he said of the
film, “Pellz the Conqueror is a
towering achievement — a triumph,
especially forMax von Sydow, With
this ﬁlm, he crowns his career. His
Lasse,crcated from sodeeply within,
is as splendid a portrayal as we are
likely to see. Pelle the Conqueror is
the era’s best film.”

los Ferguson who is also Terrace
Gallery director 7 and Laura
Ferguson make up the show, “What
WeLike."The exhibit is a display of
pastels, monoprints, charcoal: and a
few pieces of pottery.

The styles ofthethreeartjslsareas
diverse as the varied mediums.
Campbell describes her pieces as
"more textured” than those of the
Fergusons. And pieces such as Car-
los Ferguson’s “Chair II” possess an
air of abstract indistinctness which
contrasts with the more corporeal
feel of some of Laura’ 3 figures

Butforalllhe '

and varied subjects and mediums
contained in the pieces, the show
holds together well as a cohesive
presentation, The eye comfortably
follows the smooth transition from
Campbell’s “textured, " bold style,
lothesofterlinesoflnuraFerguson‘ 5
works, and on to the abstract, ﬂowr
ing style in some of Carlos’ pieces.

The works progress from realistic
still-life pieces and ﬁgures in the
front room of the gallery to the ab-
stractcolorpastels in the back. Works
by all three of the artists are inter-
spersed throughout the exhibit.

“What We Like” will be in the
TenaceGalleryoftheForum through
Saturday. September 16. All are
encouraged to take a walk between
reality and abstraction and to enjoy
the remarkable interplay of these
works b three artists.

Congratulations on the 100 years,
And Good Luck in Saturday's Game!
