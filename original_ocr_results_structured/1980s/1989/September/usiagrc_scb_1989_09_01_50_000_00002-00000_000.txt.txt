Upping the ante in Lebanon

As the world turns to
watch developing
events in the Baltic nae
tionsandPoIand,thetide
is turning in Lebanon
unwatched.

Gen. Michel Aoun, commander
of the Lebanese Army, has broken
precedent and begun attacking Syr-
ian forces beyond the “red lines" —
borders beyond which combat can
no longer be restrained. Mostcom-
bat within the past fourteen years ltas
been within the “green lines," areas
between occupied zones which are
not vital to tire commercial interests
of any of the parties involved. The
change in tactics follows the warm
ing of the Lebanese Army by Iraq,
archrfoe of Syria. Iraq, bitter about
Syrian support of Iran throughout
the Gulf war. is having its revenge.

and Shiite militias, are threatening

Aoun does not pull
back. The Israelis, who
control a sizeable tract
along the Lebanese-Is-
raeli border to the
south, are seen as un-
likelyto intervene. France. however,
has sent support to her Lebanese
allies — an aircraft can-ier and five
supportcraft.'IheFrenchforces,over
3,000 troops and a plethora of misr
siles, are seen as a deterrent to a
majorSyrian counterattack,butwere
described by an independent news-
paper as “facilitating arms ship-
ments."

French intervention, noted an Ira-
nian weekly, would lead to the suf-
fering of Western hostages. TheU.S.
has not responded directly to these
claitns, but is said to be petitioning
both Aoun and the Syriarts for a re-
turn to the previous state of affairs.
Speculation on the outcome of the
increased hostilities is guarded.

New Feminist Alliance Seeks
Unity in Political Action

By Jennifer Watson

“Unity is always better in poltti-
cal action," said sophomore Rashmi
Dyal-Chand. “The more people we
can include. . .the more well be able
to do.” Rashmi was speaking of the
new Politically Active Feminist
Alliance, which convened for the
ﬁrsttime lastTuesday night in Main
lounge.

Recent political events such as
this summer' 5 Supreme Court ruling
on abortion motivated Rashmi to
start another feminist group on
campus — a group which focused
on feminist political issues. Several
students expressed an interest in
working on those issues and Rashmi
decided that a new political organi-
zation could make use of that en-
ergy.

“I envisioned a group which set up
committees which dealtwith current
issues a group that would be flex-

“lt‘sareally good beer,“saidGrin-
nell‘ s CraigOlzenak about his home-
brewed Prancing Pony Porter.”lt has
a coffee-like, roasted quality in aro—
matics and flavor.“

Olzenak, a music lecturer and su-
pervisor of the listening room at the
college, recently won second place at
the National Homebrew CompetiA
Lion, the largest homebrew Competir
lion in the world, and took a gold at
the Iowa State Fair, with his home
brewed ale.

Olzenak is a J.R.R. Tolkein buff
andnamed hisbeer terthePrancing
Pony Pub run by Barliman Butterbur
in one of Tolkein’s books. He says
his porter is “a dark British beer
modelled after what was probably
being consumed at the time."

All of Olzenak's recipes are origi-
nal, He starts with basic formulations
that have worked well and then he
begins to experimenL Olzenak has
the beneﬁt of 12 years of brewing
experience and says a good beer
comes from “much study and trying
of new beers” as well as trial and

ible in terms of timeand leadership.”

Although the alliance may decide
to organizeitselfdiffcrently,Rashmi
imagines a group involving many
people in its leadership instead of
having a single president and vice»
president. She also suggested that
interested students mi ghtforrn cam-
pus chapters of N.O.W. and
N. .R.A.L., the National Abortion
Rights Action League. In fact, the
October 7 abortion rights march
organized by N.O.W. will be the
group’s ﬁrst project.

With the addition of the Politi-
cally Active Feminist Alliance, the
Grinnell campus will have two
feminist organizations. Rashmi par-
ticipated in Women’s Group lastyw
and says it was “a support group for
women, exclusively women. We
need asupport group and 1 hope they
continue as a support group.“ She
also acknowledged that Women‘s

Group reorganizes every year and
could decide to become more politir
cally active this year. She feels that
the campus could sustain two politi-
cal feminist organizations or “we
couldjoin forces.”

Rashmi also feltthe need foranew
group because last year no organiza
tion existed for male feminists and
many men had expressed an interest
in women’s issues to her, She feels
that the more viewpoints the group
includes, the better the group will be
and so both faculty and students,
men and women will be involved in
the new organization.

For herself, Rashmi says."I can’t
remeber a time when I wasn't inter-
ested in feminist issues. Last year I
took a women’s studies course and
went to the march in DC. I realized
that more needed to be done — and
more can be done.”
