South African Women’s Struggle:
‘A Resolve to Keep Going’

By Chris Snyder

The Vusisizwe Players, a troupe
of three South African women,
ﬂooded a sell-out crowd in Roberts
TheatreTuﬁdaynightwith thesights
and sounds of black South Africa.

The story told was one of resolve
——aresolvetokeepgoingt In spite of
being separated from one’s family,
one’s homeland and one‘s customs.
In spite of being forced to beg for
sustenance. In spite of being rejected
by one‘s husband, one’s peers and
one‘s country.

“This struggle," the players sang
in theWomen‘sFreedom Song,“We
are going forward with it/ Until we
achieve our freedom.”

In what can truly be called a per-
formance, the players * Poppy
Tsira, Thobeka Maqhutyana and
Nomvula Qosha 7 acted, sang and
danced through a story of three
women hawking food near a taxi
stop outside Cape Town.

The acting was nothing if not
versatile In many scenes,one or two
of the players changed hats or picked
upaprop,suddenlybecomingsome-
one else: postmaster, policeman,
husband or child. Throughout, there
was an emphasis on mime, the key to
the play’s success outside of South
Africa. The overstated, and many

times hilariously funny, actions of
the players allowed the audience to
understand the parts of the play that
were not in English, or that were not
immediately clear.

The music in the play was unfor-
gettable.Thenativesongs andhymns
were sung in harmonies that one
student described as “fascinating.”
The songs, which were all sung in
the players native tongue, were like
splashes of color, as one note washed
over the next.

The performance was deeply
moving, with a multitude of differ
ent messages along the antirapart-
heidtheme,allfromawoman’spoint
of view. There was also a strong
feminist theme, a majorpointbeing,
“We shall continue where the men
have failed." The production was
dedicated to three founder members
of the Federation of South African
Women,

The Vusisizwe Players came to-
gether in 1986, with the Writing of
You Strike the Woman, You Strike
the Rack. They first performed the
play at a national festival of the arts
in Grahamstown, South Africa,
where itwas an instant success. They
have performed throughout Europe,
Australia, Canada and the United
States. At Grinnell, the show was
sold out within nine hours.

Alamo Bay: Racism Hits Home

By Sheila Tom

As a part of die week-long Asian-
American symposium, the award-
winning film Alamo Bay will be
shown on Wednesday, Sept. 27 at
9:15 pm in North Lounge. This
highly acclaimed film, directed by
Louis Malle, is based on the true
story of a brutal clash between the
Vietnamese immigrants of the gulf
pontownsofTexasandlocalshrimp
fishermen.

Ed Harris (The Abyss) plays an
embittered Vietnam War veteran
resentful of the competition the
Vietnamese refugees bring to the

white, American families of Alamo
Bay. Antagonism develops asAmeri-
can men who fought for the Viet-
namese during the war now witness
the encroachment of these Asian
immigrantsontheAmericanshrimp-
ing industry and the consequent
dwindling of opportunity for the
white laborers,

Alamo Bay presents a powerful
sociological ponrait of America in
the post-Vietnam War era. The eco-

-nomical conﬂict shown in this drama

depicts an ever growing form of
racism against immigrants ﬂ a ra-
cism with which we in the US, must
learn to contend.

Imagine Gardner Lounge smell-
ingheavilyofbcerandsweat,andan
impassioned Cajun just a-croonin’.
It'd bejust like being at the Bar, but
you wouldn’t have to come up with
any quarters.

Wayne Toups and Zydecajun play
their version of rock 'n‘ roll with a
couple of twists: pride in their cajun
heritage and an accordion. But these
twists in no way limit the band’s
repertoire; they are able to play
something soulful one minute and
somethingabitcountry/honkyrtonk-
esque (as they say) the next.

The bandplaysits own material as
well as covers of songs by such any
ists as Van Morrison and Aaron
Neville (of“Tell ItLikeItIs" fame).

It’s not blues and it’s not dance. If
this appeals to you, be in Gardner
Friday night.

Ché Bella Moonstruck

By Carlucci and Gian Paolo

This movie has a striking lack of
similarity to the hit movie Top Gun.
C he’ bella [mm] C he’ beIla script]
Che’ bella acting! (For those of you
who don‘t speak Italian, this means
we liked it.)

The ﬁlm isa humorous and touch
ing story about the tribulations of
romance in an Italian family in New

Olympia Dukakis gotan Oscar for
this movie, which was the only nice
thing to happen to her poor family in
aboutayear.Cher andNicholas Cage
are quite satisfactory, as well. And
the crazy grandfather is absolutely
amazing, as are his dogs

This movie will leave you feeling
good and speaking with a cheesy
Italianaccent. On a scaleof one toll

ten and a tool kit.

The

Top Gun: Boy
Meets Plane,
Boy Gets Girl

By John Paul Schmit
and Carl Thelin

One of the leading movies of the
“Remember Flight 007: Kill a Rus~
sian" genre, Top Gun has been called
dulland uninspiring. Inreality,ithas
caused a whole generation ofyoung
people to switch to PepsirCola.

If you‘re into repeated displays of
high-tech weaponry and/or Tom
Cruise'sbody, this movieis foryou.
It is not for us, however, and even
veteran Scarlet and Black movie
critic and lover of mayhem Matt
Macho would give this oneaThumbs
Down, as there is no significant
amount of violence despite all the
weaponry displayed.

Plot synopsis is as follows: boy
meets plane and gets girl.

You may want to look for altemae
tive activities for Saturday night,
such as Jim Caccamo’s concert, or
maybe an observatory Open House.
In fact, theScience Library is proba
bly a better choice than this film,

On a scale of one to seven Pepsi
bottles, this one doesn‘t even rate a
deposit. ' ‘
