Next week's LASG
fast is explained

To the editor:

The entire country of
Nicaragua is Ihe the size of Wis-
consin. Yet for its size and ap-
proximate population of three
million, it has received much at-
tention. This is because it has
been a hot-spot for controversial
politics and war. Nicaragua's
history has been one masked with
brutality and suffering. For over
40 years the U.S,-backed Somoza
dynasty, which was largel made
up of business elite, ru ed the
nation. In 1979, this regime was
toppled by the Sandinista Na-
tional Liberation Front (FSLN).

Five years later. Daniel Ortega
was elected by 67 percent of the
vote. Even before Ortega took
power, the Reagan Administra-
tion through the CIA began to
organize the contras to counter
the new government in
Nicaragua. This war on the peo-
ple of Nicaragua has existed for
almost a decade. There have been
over 20,000 deaths and poverty
has increased drastically. In addi-
tion, the nation‘s funds that could
have gone to social and health
programs have been absorbed by
the war. This. in addition to the
devastating hurricane in October
that demolished both rural and
urban areas and has left Nicaragua

in desperate need of support.
Hence. . .The Latin American
Support Group is sponsoring its
third annual three-day fast begin-
ning on Tuesday, April I8, at 6
pm, and ending Friday. April 21.
at 6 pm. We are working in
collaboration with the Des
Moines chapter of Quest for
Peace. This chapter is presently
filling a cargo/truck which will
be leaving in late May to bring
supplies and donations to the
people of Nicaragua. We hope to
be able to supply part of this do»
nation. In the past Grinnell
College students generated over
$3,000 in pledge money from the
fast. The cargo will be
transporting clothing, medical
aid, toys, sports equipment, and
educational supplies. During the
fast we will have designated
boxes in various public places
throughout the campus where
donations of this sort can be de-
posited. Quest for Peace is a
non-profit organization which
works to provide TRUE humani-
tarian aid for the people of
Nicaragua. They do not discrim»
inate on any political or religious
basis in their distribution or sup-
plies and aid. Anthippy Petras

Reader supports Macho
on abortion issue

To the editor:

Last week Mr. Michael Kent,
while arguing his anti-pro-choice
or pro-anti-anti-life ideology,
mentioned several “real winners,"
naming Lyndon LaRouche, Jane
Fonda, the Nazi Party, and Matt
Macho. I feel obligated to say
that Mr. Kent is mistaken be-
cause some of these people are
actually not “winners" but
”losers." Lyndon LaRouche and

the Nazi Party have both never
been victorious in a US. na»
tional election although they
have done well in Illinois. But I
must concede that Mr. Kent‘s list
is at least 50-pcrcent correct be-
cause Jane Fonda has won an
Academy Award and Matt Macho
has won the argument. Paul

SCARLET AND BLACK

Against the Grain

“Good Lord, they're EV-
ERYWHERE! AAAAAAAA!”

Leviticus 20, verse 13.

Just kidding.

Hey now, It‘s Gay Pride Week!
Timeforall us homophobestostop
oppressing these who engage in al-
ternative lifestyles. Let's abolish
all the homophobic practices of our
school! Discrimination roams free
inouradmi ion,housing,grading,
financial-aid. dining. and
mailroom policiesl

Well, maybe not.

Right off the top I’ll
say that American homosexuals do
have some legitimate gripes. Anti-
sodomy laws and workplace dis-
criininatien are problems that need
to be addressed. As long as con»
senting adults are the parties in-
volved.citizens should be frectodo
whatever they want behind their
bedroom doors. They aren’t hurt-
ing anybody, so their pursuit of
happiness should not be hindered.

lfthis was the extent ofthe Gay
Pride movement I would support it
100 percent. The right to choose
yoursexualpreference,however,is
only the tip of the iceberg. My
problems begin when Iread the list
ot‘diingslmustdoinordertonotbe
considered homophobic.

A phobia is an irrational and dc—
bililating fearofsomething. Homo—
phobia then, is an irrational and de-
bilitating fearofhomosexuais. De~
spite all Ihe accusations and finger-
pointing,mostpcoplcurenothomo»
phobic. lam nothomophobic. lam
not afraid of homosexuals and am
quite comfortable with my het—
eroscxuality.

I will admit that I do netactivcly
seek out the company of homo-
sexuals. Despite the rhetoric, i do
not feel flattered if a homosexual
shows an interest in me. It is a
situation that I do not wish to be in
and will avoid to the best of my
ability.

I‘m not crazy about seeing same-
sex couples at Lruditionally hctero»
sexual social occasions. Am I un-
reasonable for wanting to attend a
Scx-preference—oriented cvcntwitli
other persons oftny sex—preference?
Idon’tthinkCatholicsgotoiewish
synagogues and I think the Jews
have a right to expect that. I‘m not
saying homosexuals don't have the
right to attend heterosexual social
events;whetherIlikeitornotmakes
nedifference. EutIdon’tlikc it.

But let‘s go into the obvious. I
refer to the listof 10 things you are

EXPERIENCE: CHINA.
The University of" onimquc
presents the opnortunily
ii‘ an exceliunt six-week
experience of China. Six

supposed to do during Gay Prrde
Week to renounce your homopho-
bia. Some of them are extra-spe-
cial: wear drag one day, tell your
parents you're gay and don'tdeny
it later. ostracize your heterosexual
friends, walk across campus hold~
ing hands with your best friend of
your gender. Why would any
heterosexual wanttodoanyoflhese
things?! If you weren’t gay, why

would you wantpeeple to

thinkthatyouwere?! Why
Mike Kent defy your gender if you

are happy with it?
Granted, the most progressive of us
willsay;"Don’tknockittillyou try
it," and, as recommended at the
homophobia workshop, will make
it a point to have a homosexual en-
counter just to see what it's like.
But hey, that's what progressives
are for. I'm not into bestiality, ei-
ther, but I'm not going to try it in
the interest of being open-minded.
Now yeah, we all know our
society is heterosexist, etc. and so
forth. Just look at the evidence:
TV, ads, literature. Of course it

isn't possible that these media are
trying to appeal to the most people
they can, and most people aren't
homosexual. It'sallreally discrimi~
nation. Never mind that most
moviegoers will better relate to a
heterosexual couple than a homo»
sexual one. We're “shoving our
sexuality down your throat" (ex»
cuse the terminology).

I know that if I were a hetero-
sexual living in a predominantly
homosexual society,I would besat-
isﬁedwidibeingallowedtodowhat
I wanted in my bedroom without
government intervention, as long
asIdidn'thurtanybody else, Ifyeu
don’t like homophobes. don‘tasso~
ciate with them. A person's beliefs
are their own business, and as long
as they don‘t interfere with your
liberty, you have no place telling
them how they should think.

And as far as you being ev-
erywhere, so are blacks. conserve»
tives, handicapped people, Ieho~
vah's Witnesses, left-handers. and
bald people. Every group is every»
where, so what‘s the point?
