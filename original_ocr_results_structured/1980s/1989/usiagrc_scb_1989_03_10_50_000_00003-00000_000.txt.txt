Hancock ad wins award

by Dave Jones

Grinnell College‘s national
minority»recruitment advertising
campaign was awarded a silver
medal in the Fourth Annual Ad-
missions Advertising Awards
competition for excellence in ad,
missionrcommunications pro-
grams. More than 1,400 entries
from nearly 400 colleges,
universities, and technical
schools nationwide were submit-
ted in this year‘s competition,
which was sponsored by Admis-
sions Marketing Report, the na-
tional newspaper of admissions
marketing.

Oscarrwinning musician,
composer, and conductor Herbie
Hancock, who graduated from
Grinnell College in 1960, is fear
lured in the full-page, full-color
ad. Hancock, who received an
honorary doctorate of fine arts
from Grinnell in 1972, urges
prospective minority students to
“try the 'Grinnell Experience."’
The Grinnell campaign, which
ran in Ebony and Black Enter~
prise magazines last year, was the
first national minority-recruit»
mcnt advertising campaign for a
college

“The ad was basically de—
signed to create awareness,” said
Floyd Akins, Jr., assistant direcr
tor and coordinator of minority
admission, “Our problem with
the black community is that our
school is not very wail-known,“
he said Akins proposed the idea
for the minority advertising carn-

paign in 1987.

A panel of marketing,
advertising, and academic profes-
sionals judged the entries, basing
their decisions on quality of pro-
duction, creativeness of concept,
and clarity of the message.

faculty members will travel to
Washington, DC, on Friday,
April 7, to participate in the
March for Women's
Equality/Women‘s Lives on
Sunday, April 9, Three Grinnell
professors organized the trip,
which is subsidized by President
George Drake, the Noun Program
in Women’s Studies, and the
Rosenfield Program in Public
Affairs, International Relations,
and Human Rights.

Roberta Atwell, professor of
education, said that she and other
faculty members discussed taking
a carload of people to the march,
but that they eventually decided
to charter a bus because of the
length of the trip and the number
of people who expressed an
interest in participating
Subsidies from college programs
will cover half the transportation
expenses. Atwell said, but each
participant must pay $40 to meet
the rest of the cost. To avoid
further expenses, organizers of
the trip are investigating the
possibility of spending the night
in a church basement

“We‘re worried about the
cost," said English Instructor

takes time and motley to make
that kind of a statement.“ Nev-

Grinnellians to march
for women's rights

highlight support for the Equal
Rights Amendment as well as for
the legality of abortion, which
the Supreme Court affirmed in
1973 in the landmark Roe vs.
Wade case The decision is
currently being challenged in the
court.

According to Gehhard, the
impetus for the march stemmed
from the recent challenge to the
1973 decision. “1 would hate to
see abortion become illegal
again, and the kinds of things
that would happen as a result of
that,” she said. "Many people
would suffer.” Voertrnan agreed,
expressing her concern about "the
jeopardy that women will be put
in if the Roe vs. Wade decision is
reversed." She added, “The
women who have little access to
money or information will be
punished most by that kind of
action."

The rally will also show
support for the passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment The
focus of the lobbying on April
10, Said Atwell, will be “to get
ERA back on the ballot.”
