Purple Roos'and Skull Crushers on Tour

. Sincewelastcaughtupwith them,
the R005 and Skull Crushers have
traversed the Midwest participating
in several invitationals.

The men’s varsity squad made the
long journey to the Notre Dame
Invitational to meet some of the best
cross country teams in the nation.
The Roos were enthusiastic as they
started out on the relatively ﬂat
course, but did not run the outstand-
ing race they had hoped for. Still,
they finished a respectable 15th out
of 20 teams.

The most positive aspect of the
day was the packing. Grinnell’s
secondthroughfifthninnersfinished
within 23 seconds of each other,
giving the varsity the experience of
a quality race without the pressure.

The women’s teamopted not togo
to Notre Dame but to send the entire
squad to the state meet. Upon arrive
ing, they discovered that most of the
course was a virtual rollercoasteri
With someofthe Skull Crushers laid
up by illness, the team still managed
to finish fourth in a field of eight
teams.

Women’s Soccer Shuts Out Wartburg

By Layne Maly

Last Tuesday on the soon-to-be-
dedicated Springer Memorial Field.
the Grinnell women’s soccer team
closed out their impressive ‘89 sea-
son with a 7—0 blowout win over
Wartburg College. This seaonvendr
ing victory raised the team‘s overall
record toan awesome 104, with a5-
1 conference record already posted.

Grinnell’s 10—4 record was well
canted and hard fought as the high—
spirited booters defwted some of the
best teams in the Midwest confer-
CHCC.

Although losing a tough 1-0 game
to U. Wisconsin»Stevens Point in
arctic temperatures, the Grinnell
women bounced right back the fol-
lowing aftemoon to avenge the dc-
featby crushing Ripon 62 Forward
SaraConner tallied the firstand fifth
goals of the game, with Anya
Schwartz. Susan Thomas, Stcph
Reisdorf and Ann “I ordered pepper-
oni, not sausage" Treistrnan eaclt
adding a goal apiece to finish off a
bewildered Ripon.

Boosting theirrecord to 772 at that
point in the schedule, the Pioneers
traveled hometostayoverfallbrcak,
and to host St. Norbert and Law-
rence Universities in two big and

crucial conference matchrups. The
Grinnell players rose to the occasion
inboth games and walked away with
two impressive victories.

After letting St. Norbert take an
early 1-0 lead, the merciless Grin-
nell team turned up the intensity.
Outshooting St. Norbert32-1 i,Gn'n-
nell’s offense was too overpowering
for the tiring Norbert’s defense.
Freshman sensation Anya Schwartz
tallied twogoals ofher own to clinch
another vicrory for the Pioneers.

. Determination. hard-work, and a
positive attitude also lifted Grinnell
to a big 3-1 win over a disgruntled
team from Lawrence. Grinnell’s
defense consistently shut down
Lawrence‘s offensive threats, and
even showed that the defense could
put some points on the board.

Sophomore fullback Nancy Kai-
sertalliedwhatcame tobethe game—
winning goal early in the second
half, onashot that left theLawrence
goalkeeper frozen in her tracks
Junior Sara Conner and freshman
Anya Schwartz each raised their
season goal totals by scoring one
apiece and boosting Grinnell to vic»
tory.

Despite two tough late-season
losses to Tarkio and Carleton, the
Grinnell women’s soccer team’s

record was superb enough to earn
them second-place conference hon—
ors, and sixth place in the Midwest
Region. Outscoring opponents 38-
14, Grinnell’s powerful offense and
stingy defense made their presence
known in the expanding confcrence.

Team members say they are look-
ing forward to next season. having
enjoyed this season’s success, and
hope to build on an already growing
and successful program.

cer game against Carleton College.

had a great race, leading the team
with a lOthrplacc finish. The Robs
showed team cohesion with a tight
pack of nine runners. who were
together during various portions of
the race.

The next weekend was the tradi-
tional pre»fall break meet hosted by
Coe 7 the “crazy shorts" meet, in
which the runners wear bizarre, col-
orful, unattractive, obscene orother-
wise interesting shorts. Craziest
shorts included Brett Kelver‘s tin
foil/Campbell ’s soup label ensemble
and Gerald Honigstock’s “loud"
knee—length pastel/neon shorts.

Coe’s course at Jones Park was
scenic, but strenuous, with an abso-
lutely humongous, gigantic. mony
strous calf-wrenching hill. The
women fared better in that respect
for their course involved one trip up

the slope, while the men were bur- .

dened with two torturous trips up the
”mountainside," .

Crushers racing,thewomen finished

the team, but it was another mile-
stone in the team‘s preparation for

the final meets of the season.

The men, on the other hand. in-
spired by their ravishing attire and
the possibility of including a short
mountain climb in their “jaunt,"
finished a suprtsing 2nd, with 48
points. just five shy of Central’sscore
of 43. With only half the varsity
squad present, the team depth was
evident. as Gerald Honigstock, Eric
Fuld, Eben Erhard and others moved
up to fill the empty slots.

Another notable sight was that of
assistant coach Scott Hamilton who,
mnnning unofficially and with no
training, survived the course and ran
a respectable race.

With the hardest training behind
them, the Roos and Skull Crushers
