Drake firm on
housing policy

by loss a Welscl

Despite continued protests Ivy
sltttlans, Grit-melt College Prcxtr
dent George Driite has refused to
reconsider his veto ot the Coin-
lnlttee on Student Llfe’s (CSL)
housing policy allowing institu-
imnally married same-sex couples
to live off campus prior to their
Junior year.

After ltlst week’s protest, 54
students scheduled tlppolntmans
to discuss the veto and Drake's
newly implemented policy,
which no longer allows legally
married students to move off
campus. Citing time constraints,
Drakc had his secretary randomly
select 10 students to meet With
him in groups of ﬁve.

Drake met with the first
group of students at 3:30 pm,
Monday afternoon, while about
65 students marched and chanted
on the Nollen House lawn.

Claiming that the housing-
policy decision was caused more
by homophobia than by Drake’s
expressed desire to maintain the

integrity of the residential col-
lege, the demonstrators chanted,
“Hey, hey, lie, lio, homopllobla’s
got to go.“

Taking part in the
demonstration were Melanie
Cooley and her fiancee Jennifer
Barber. The couple had planned
on being married lasr weekend,
but were unable to do so. In—
stead, the couple is planning a
May 6 wedding performed by
college chaplain Dennis Haas.

During the meeting, Todd
Brown told Drake, “I‘m not sure
. . . that you believe that it‘s a
good thing to split up a couple,
which is exactly what‘s going to
be happening.“ He added, ”I feel
like it’s not necessary to justify
their relationship. This is some»
thing that is equally valid. I
mean this is basic, very basic
homophobia, , .(Cooley’s and
Barber’s) is a valid relationship.”

at Iowa C

apitol ‘

for pro-choice

by Kim Eckart

Over 70 Grinncll students
joined a group of nearly 1000
people present at the Rally to
Save Women’s Lives last Saturn
day. The rally, held at the Iowa
State Capitol, was sponsored by
the National Organization for
Women, the Mid-Iowa Coalition
of Labor Union Women, and the
Iowa Women’s Political Caucus.

Most members of the Grin-
ncll representation were dressed in
white, and many carried coat han-
gers and signs. During the rally,
hangers were traded for American
flags, symbolizing the American
belief in freedom of choice and
the right to privacy. This belief

.was the primary theme of the

rally and the [unditmenlal reason
for student support.

“1 went to lhe rally because I
don’t think anyone should be al-
lowed to decide for a woman

whether abortion is right or
wrong," said Heather Hcimbueh,

Speakers at the rally included
Lt. Gov. Io Ann Zimmerman,
Banker‘s Trust president and
Grinncll College trustee John
Crystal, and keynote speaker
Mary Joan Collins of Catholics
for Free Choice. Some addressed
the consequences of the possible
reversal of Roe vs. Wade, point-
ing out the return to back-alley
and solfrinduccd abortions.

“Women seeking abortions
are not a deviant minority," Said
sneaker Chuck DcCroSs of the
University of Iowa. A reversal of
Roe vs. Wade would lead to civil
disobedience by physicians na-
tionwide, he added.

The common issue among
protesters was the principle that
