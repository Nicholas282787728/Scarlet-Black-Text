Student says college
treats students like
children, not adults

To the editor.

Last week students protested
President Drake’s exceptionally
inadequate answer to what we the
students saw as a major abuse of
the rights of our fellow students.
The students who participated
showed great commitment. All
gathered, no matter their own
race, creed, color, sex, or sexual
preference, to stand up for what
they saw as an injustice. They
stood together out of genuine
concern for others, in an attempt
to make a difference. Students
marched, students chanted, stu-
dents slept out in front of Nolleu
I-Iouse, students argued, and when
this was done they marched a lit-
ue more. In retrospect, however,
we have accomplished nothing.
The policy has not changed. de
spite our best efforts. All we can
do is be reminded of how little
Fespect the administration has for
the students' concerns. No one,
however, seems to take a second
look and see where this lack of
respect comes from.

By now all of you know that
the wheels are in motion for one
administration-purchased, student-
and SGA-approved, regulation—
type playground. The
administration said we car- have it
if we wanted it and like fish to a
shiny fly, we bought it hook.
line, and sinker. We asked no
questions, we were told no lies,
Eve just said, “Sure, sounds like

un.”

With those words, we the
students showed ourselves to be
everything the administration ex—
pects us to be. We never asked,
"How much will this cost?" or
:‘What will this email?" We who
‘were so irate, not so long ago,
about an increase in tuition, let it
slip our minds.

For those who are interested,
the playground will cost some»
where in the neighborhood of

 

$20,000. I hope all of you got
that, Just to repeat, that was
TWENTY THOUSAND DOL-
LARS. This is of course.
according to Tadd Johnson (who
heads the ad hoc playground
committee), without the increased
insurance the school will have to
pay. During the recent election,
Jefff Fields pointed out that stu-
dents now have to go on desk
hunts so they can have a place to
sit in classes. Well, Jefff, with
that tidy sum Grinncll could buy
enough chairs to kill that prob—
lem. Better yet, treat the disease
rather then the symptoms and
hire a new professor; that should
help the problem.

Instead of this we're getting a
playground. Fivc other play-
grounds in the area, but I’ll bet
they tell you ours will be special
i bet after they tell us that we all
forget about it and go back to
talking about how little respect
we get and how the administra
tion never takes us seriously.

Want the administration to
take us seriously? Let them
know where you stand. I chalr
lenge each and everyone of you to
write and talk and shout; to
Walker, to Drake, to SGA, and if
your lungs are still in shape for
it, to Tadd Johnson. If you
choose not to listen to me we can
always keep talking about how
little we can accomplish. It is
after all easier to talk than to ac-
complish, now isn’t it?

The administration calls us
adulm and treats us like children:
the student body wants to be
treated like adults, but if we let
this go we will be such in name
alone. But hey, if children We so
choose to be, give it a year or so;
we should have a nifty 20-grand
set of monkey bars to play on.

Macho responds to call for
gays to act "normally"

l'o the editor.

While it is not my intention
to be belligerent to Jon Locke, I
feel I must respond to his letter
last week to the effect that gay
people should act "normally"
(whatever that means) in order to
prevent provoking a backlash by
a freakedout straight comnlunity.

While Jon is quite right in
believing that outrageous behave
ior will provoke a backlash,
should equality and freedom from
bigotry be restricted to only those
gays who wear “businesstypc
clothing”? Gay people (and their
allies) are engaged in a struggle
of liberation from oppression.
This struggle is going to provoke
backlash no matter how “Straighb
acting" we are.

Jon’s suggestion, if implcr
merited, would amount to inter-
nalized oppression (homophobia)
in the gay community. By
ostracizing drag queens. leather-

men, biker dykes, and other gays
and lesbians the establishment
finds “offensive," we cut off our
own arms, which would other-
wise be helping in the struggle,
while it is doubtful that hostile
straight audiences would be any
less offended. How can we truly
fight a war for freedom of
sexuality between consenting
adults if we oppress ourselves?

I will point out that the his
toric Stonewall riot. which
marked the beginning of a new
era of gay pride, was fought pri»
marily by drag queens, hustlers.
and other "undesirablcs" who
were subjected to the worst ha»
rassmcnt of the time and had
nothing to lose by fighting back.

Also, it should be noted that
in all probability at least 80 per-
cent of the people in the Texas
lesbian/gay rally Jon cites WERE
dressed “normally,” but the media

chose to publicize the most sen-
sational-looking marchers for a
more provocative film clip con-
forming to societal stereotypes
about what gay people are
“supposed” to look like. If the
people watching were
uncomfortable looking at scantily
clad men, they should adjust their
shorts.

The argument over whether
the gay community should
“sterilize" iLsclf has raged in both
the straight and gay communities
for many years (luckily, this ace
comodationist approach has been
rejected by most gay people as
self-destructive), and there is
plenty of material on it if you
wish to learn more about it. The
Rise of the Gay and Lesbian
Movement, by Barry Adam, is a
good basic text to start with.

Explaining the Senior Challenge

To the editor:

We were pleased to see last
week‘s S curler and Black coverage
of the formation of the Senior
Challenge Committee, and the
committee‘s goal of getting at
least 50 percent participation in
the Annual Fund by the class of
1989. The article also reported
the matching gift offer from
members of the Alutnni Board,
and we would like to clarify and
expand brieﬂy on tho of fer.

LWhD we are. The Alumni
Board is composed of 19 alumni
of Grinncll, sewing on a volun-
teer basis for terms of up to six
years. We advise the Ofﬁce of
Alutnni Programs specifically,
and the administration generally,
on programs for alumni, and on
programs where alumni serve the
college. Many of us are class
agents, class fund directors,
alumni are meetings coordinators,
admission volunteers and career
development volunteers. We
come from graduating classes
from the 1980s to the 19303.
We are not the Trustees. We are

not millionaires. We are merely
former Grinncll students who
continue to care about Grinncll,
and want to sex: The Grinncll EXA
pcricnce continue for future gen—
crauons,

2. Why we’re challenging the
seniors. In less than one month,
you will be alumni. We want to
welcome you to the continuation
of The Grinncll Experience,
which, like the four years at
Grinncll. has both its privileges
and its responsibilities. During
your four years at Grinncll, the
alumni of the college paid over
$2000 of your college education!
This does not include monies
contributed for ncw_buildings
(like thc Harris Student Center)
or renovations (like ARH), This
does not include special scholar
ships, or endowments, or special
funds. This does not include the
contributions of the Trustees. It
does include the annual contribu-
tions of normal former students
of the college, giving $5, $50.
$500 or whatever they can.
These gifLs from alumni, over the
four years each of you has at-
tended Grinncll, add up to over
$2000 in student loans that you
or your parents didn‘t have to
pay, or $2000 in student loans
that are not now staring at you.

3. How the matches work.
For each senior who contributes
to the Annual Fund in the Senior
Challenge, we will give ﬁve dol-
lars. If at least half of the class
contributes, we will double our
contribution to ten dollars per

ONLY

student. Finally, if you wish to
designate our matching gift for a
particular use, we will designate
our matching gift for that use.
We respect your concerns for the
college, and we‘re pleased to
reinforce your concerns with our
matching gifts.

4. Whose idea was it to have
a gift matching Challenge?
Stephen K. Kent, class of 1967.
Last year, Steve, a new member
of the Alumni Board and the class
fund director for the class of
1967, personally challenged the
class of 1988 to try to match
‘67s level of giving. I-Ie person-
ally pledged to proVide the
matching funds, The rest of us
on the Alumni Board were so
moved by Steve‘s personal com-
mitment that we are calling this
year's matching gift progmm the
Stephen K. Kent ‘67 Challenge.
Those of you who know Steve
from his campus visits are well
aware of his love for Grinncll (if
you don’t know him, you might
ask one of our student mem-
bersiGreg Evans, Valerie In-
gram and Fred Morris— about
him), and we consider his support
of the college and its students an
inspiration to all of us. We hope
you will enjoy The Grinncll Ex-
pericnce after graduation as we
do, and We hope you will let the
Stephen K. Kent ‘67 Challenge
help you reinforce your first con-
tribution to making The Grinnell
Experience available to others.
Barry Ancona ‘68, for the
Alumni Board
