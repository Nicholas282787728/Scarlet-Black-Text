Overholser
Urges Activism

for Class of ’89

Grinnell’s graduating seniors
should “live witlt principle, and also
with gusto" and should “challenge
the status quo," said Geneva Over-
holser, editor of The Des Moines
Register, in a brief, politically
charged commencement addrms last
May 22.

Overholser criticized the compla-
cency of theReagan Administration
and the “timidity” of George Bush's
domestic and foreign policies, and
urged the graduates to“makea com-
mitment to usefulness."

“I am, I remind you, a product of
the Sixties," she said.

Overholser became one of the
youngestwomenevertoheadamajor
daily newspaper when she signedon
as The Register‘s executive editor in
1988. She had previously worked as
a reporter in Colorado Springs and
as an editorial writer for The New
York Times.

US. foreign policy is “constrained
by fearfulness and timidity,” she said.
“Where is the reach, where are the
visions, the dreams and the risk-
taking that made this nation great?"

Overholser said that domestic
policy is marked by “selfvcongratu-
lation." “We trymto ignore home»
lessness. joblessness, illiteracy,
babies born addicted to crack.” she
said.

Overholser praised Grinnell’s
class of 1989 for its “evident social
conscience, made apparent here
today in green and purple ribbons
and in pink triangles" — worn by

many graduates in supportof aid to
the homeless and gay and lesbian
rights.

She urged the graduates to con»
tinue their activism by embracing
change and taking risks.

“Don’t assume that others know
better,“ Overholser said. “Question
authority Challenge the status quo.
Be suspicious of moral rigidity. Take
on roles that are not traditional to
your sex or to your profession or to
your social standing. The effort will
be rewarded a hundredfold."

“Goforth and makeadifference in
our world," she said “And when
you go. think of Iowa."

Overholser’s husband, Michael,
graduated from Grinnell in 1970, a
year in which Grinnell cancelled
graduation ceremonies in the wake
of four student shootings at Kent
State University by the Ohio Na-
tional Guard. Overholser told the
graduates, “I’m helping him make
up for that by bringing him to yours."

After ﬁnishing her speech, Over-
holser was given an honorary doc~
torate of humane letters.

Downtown merchants have been

Because of the storeowners’ com-
plaints, police have been asking the
teenagers to move on.That has led to
charges of harassment from people
who say the youths are doing nothA

“The police are caught in be-

The police chief said no one will

AT THE BACCA UREA'I'E

For Graduates, Words of Encouragement;
For Administration, a Sharp Reproach

Speakers at last May‘s baccalau-
reatc ceremony had both criticism
and encouragement for the gradu-
ates, but only harsh words of re-
proach for the administration, in a
program that drew a capacity crowd
to Herrick Chapel.

In the keynote address, Kesho
Scott, an associate professor of
American studies and sociology,
praisedGrinnell’sintellectuallyopen
atmosphere but condemned the
small»mindedness of racism and
homophobia here.

In anodter address, senior Valerie
Ingram admonished Grinnell stu-
dents for their faddish devotion to
social causes and sharply criticized
the college administration for refus-
ingtorecognize lesbian and gay mar-
riages in its housing policies.

Scott said Grinnell is a “Studenla
centered institution" ”where you
could get to the nitty gritty of bumV
ing scholarly questions such as, ‘Is
the Grinnell logo phallocentric?‘ “

Inconclusion,Scotttoldthegradu-
ates, “I ask you to remember to look
inside yourselves when things look
bleak." “You. . .are the boss of your

The ceremony. traditionally i

viewed as a spiritual charge to a
graduating class, drew a capacity
crowd to Herrick Chapel. Scores of
parents and students remained out~
side the building, on folding chairs
and on the grass. following the pro-
ceedings with the help of two audio
speakers.

Scott drew a analogy between
Grinnell and the mythical Land of
Oz.

“Grinnell has been a bit like the
Land of 02," Scott said, “a strange
place“wherestudentlifeis“likeone
hell of a journey downayellow brick
road of these academic hallways.“

But she said Grinnell is also a
placewhere“munchkins"enjoygreat
educational opportunity.

“Grinnell has been a Land of Oz,"
Scott said, because “it has been a
place for support of an African-
American,aplaretospeakoutagainst
the badwitches of racism,and where
flying monkeys spreading hompho-
bia against the civil rights of gays
andlesbiansarcshotdown,andwhere
good witches sit on high chairs in
women's studies and burn sexists at
the intellectual stake!"

Though the homophobic “ﬂying
monkeys” went unnamed, Scott
seemed to be refen-ing to the incident
last spring in which college presir
dent George Drake vetoed a student
government resolution that would
have included lesbian and gay mar-
riages in thecollege‘s housing guide-
lines.

enough to advance civil rights and

Ingram compared a stylish social
cause to the freight trains that run
through campus: “Thewhistie startles

said. “Wejump on the train, writing

Ingram also joined Scott in criti-
