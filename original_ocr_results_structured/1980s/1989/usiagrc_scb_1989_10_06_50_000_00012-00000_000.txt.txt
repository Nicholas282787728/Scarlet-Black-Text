mentprocess,Deminoffsaid,itmust
operate as if no applicant shortage
existed.

“The low applicant pool can’t be
an excuse. We have to be as inven-
Live as we can in hiring minor-hes,"
he said. “We’re not just waiting for
the number of minority applicants
and candidates to increase."

Deminoff added that there are
short-term and long-tenn solutions
to the problem. On the immediate
level, there is an emphasis on the
hiring process — on continuing to
seek out tenured minority faculty
rather than recent graduates. Older,
more experienced faculty wouldalso
provide much-needed role models
for minority students, he said,

Although one of the primary fo-
cuses of last month‘s committee
meeting was to avoid dwelling on
the negative aspects of the situation,
many faculty believe that some of
Grinneil’s possible drawbacks sim-
ply cannot be ignored.

Al Jones, social studies depart-
ment chair, noted Grinnell‘s inabil-
ity to compete with large universi-

ties in areas such as research oppor-
tunitics and accessible urban con-
tacts.

“At Grinnell, you must be inter-
ested in a certain kind of teaching or
faculty position,“ said Michael
Cavanagh, chair of the English doe
partment. “it’s not just rural lowat
At a large university, there is not as
much community service involved,
but there is more research time."

Most faculty agree that Grinneil
has made extensive efforts to hire
minority faculty,butsay theattempts
clearly have not been successful.

“Faculty feel very frustrated about
this particular problem In our hiring
procedures, we try lots of things to
attract minority faculty. We’re very
sensitive to this issue," said Chuck
lepsen,sciencedepartment chair and
former chair of the affirmative ac—
tion committee. “Everything we've
attempted to do in recent years hasn’t
paid off,” lepsen saidt

lonm added that although the hir-
ing of minority faculty is mostly a
departmental responsibility, the re;

administrativedepartmentalso share
responsibilities and make policies.
It has been an all-college effort, but
made in thetraditionalprocedures of
hiring and eliciting of candidates,”
Jones said. “There should be differ-
ent sorts of strategies, because the
traditional methods just haven’t
worked out,” he said.

The hiring process begins when
the department presents a job de—
scription of an open position to the
executive council. The description
must then get the approval of the
council and the afﬁrmative action
committee. Advertisements arethen
placed in joumals suchas'l‘heChron-
icle of Higher Education and Black
Issues in Higher Education, and
graduate schools are contacted. Also
consistently used is the Women‘s
and Minority Vita Bank, which
contains over 450 dossiers on pro»
spective candidates

A list of candidates is presented to
the affirmative action office. If no
women or minorities appear on the
list, the ofﬁce must check with the
specific department A guide for the
interview procedure includes ex-
amples of acceptable and unaccept-
able interview questions. The proce
dure is designed to prevent candi-
dates from refusing positions based
on their treatment during an inter-
view.

”This faculty is very aware of its
responsibilitesinthehiringofwomen
and minorities. I see this from a
centralperspective,”saidDeminoff.

Grinnell’s affirmative action
guidelines state the college’s goals:

“TheAffirmative Action Program is
committed to therecruitrnent, hiring
and promotion of women, minorir
ties and other persons who are cov-
ered by federal statutes,,..The Pro
gram calls for deliberate effort on
the part of those responsible for
departmental searches to expend
extra effort in seeking women and
minority candidates for positions.”

The guidelines also say that a
womanorminoritycandidatezunong
the finalists in an “aceeplable range
of quality" — a group in which all
candidates are well-qualiﬁed for the
position —— must be awarded the
position if at all possible.

“Some candidates within this
group will be seen as better qualified
than others,butﬁrstpriority must be
given to women or minority candi-
dates whether or not they are at the
highest level of this group,” the
guidelines say.

Charles Duke, dean of the faculty,
said that the faculty and administra-
tion adhere to affirmative action
policies "There has never been a
question that the department chairs
are absolutely committed to hiring
minority faculty. There must be a
pretty good reason not to bring a
minority applicant to campus,” he
said.

The psychology deparunent has
recently opened up a ﬁfth position,
to teach social psychology and per-
sonality. According to psychology
chair David Lopatto, all hiring pro-
cedures are being followed and the
deparment will wait until Jan. 1 to
stop receiving applications.

Any change in the number of
women and minority faculty meme

bers reﬂects the size of the national
applicant pool,Lopattosaid. Hecited
the increase in the number of women
faculty from 32 in 1988439 to an
estimated 50 in 1989-90 as not to-
tally to Grinnell’s credit

“it’s not just something Grinneil
did We didn't necessarily have a
select hand in the applicant pool
There was a big change at the na-
tional level," Lopatto said. “There
may have to be a big change at the
nationallevel for all minority groups
as wellt"

According to Deminoff’s Com-
prehensive Report on Affirmative
Action, of the 128 members of the
teaching faculty last year, 92 were
men, 32 were women and four were
minorities. Broken down, 22 per-
cent of Grinneil professors were
black, compared with a nationwide
average of 2percent. Black assistant
professors made up 2.2 percent of
Grinneil ’s total faculty, compared to
a national average of 5 percent.

Deminoff’sestimates for 1989-90
showa total of 150 facultymembers,
including 50 women, three blacks
and six Asians.

In light of the low number of
minority faculty and the declining
applicantpool,Deminoffcitedlong-
tenn programs currently utilized,
such as the minority scholars-in
residence program, begun last May
to encourage minority scholars to
teach at liberal arts schools. Similar
to this program is the suggestion for
Grinnell to maintain contact and
support for its minority alumni who
attend graduate school and may re-
turn here to teach.

“To insure that the currentdecline
ends, the number of minorities re—
ceiving masters and doctorates must
increase," said Deminoff.

This futuristic attitude is reﬂected
in the college’s Des Moines Moul-
ton School program, in which Grin-
nell will help pay tuition for all
membersofthisyear's fifthgrade—
mostly poor minority students —
who will attend college.

Some faculty agree that an in-
crease in the applicant pool will not
be an immediate outcome.

“The college is not just sitting
back waiting for applicants to show
up, but the payoff won’t happen for
along time,” said Lopatto.

Deminoff also spoke of plans to
work with the town to create a more
racially diversecommunityistilla
goal for the college.

“IfGrinnellCollege,inthemiddle
orowa, was an example of a multi-
racialcommunity,itwouldbea great
service to society,” Jcpsen said.

The President’s Committee for a
Stronger Minority Presence plans to
reconvene in March to examine the
results of their September meeting.
