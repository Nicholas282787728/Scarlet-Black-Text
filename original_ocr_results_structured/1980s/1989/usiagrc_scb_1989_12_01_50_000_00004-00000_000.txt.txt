Now On Sale: God

By Mark Baumann

I don’t like Christmas. Much. I
don‘t like Christmas lights. At all. I
mean, do homeowners thinkto themv
selves“l-lmm. what can Ido to make
tlte exterior of my home seem even

I'm talkin' ‘boutﬂannelnightgowns
and eggnogi Christmas wants every-
body to be nice, so nice everybody
giver somebody else a gift, no ex-
ceptions. This is dumb: there are
people out there who don't need to
have their present existence encour-

 

more box-like?
Accentuate the
edges? Yes! I‘ll
hang lights to ac-
centuate the per-
fectstraightnessof
suburbia"? No,
they don‘L They
just throw up the
strando-lightsand
hope it catches an
eavc, so they can
go inside where
it’s warm and do
something pro-
ductive,likewatch

kids to quit having
fun and get inside.

These lights re- -
ally don’t have that much to do with
the holiday. Well, I guess they do,
now that I guess about it. What is
Christmas, anyway? Christmm is a
buncha shopping and a buncha cute
kids in footie-pj's and a buncha
highway fatalities Christmas is non-
stop cuttural muzak, a few weeks
where the constant buzz of good
vibes takes your mind off real prob-
lems, like “Where’s all this electric-
ity coming from," and puts it_in the
realm of “Hey. this war on drugs
idea seems like a good one."

Some complain the commerciali-

.zation of X-mas is somehow profan-
ing its origins as a religious episode.
ldon‘tagree. I live in a nation where
“god" is best measured in easy-to
oountincrements, like one, ﬁve, and
twenty. And he/she who wields the
plastic—well, there is a person with
a true avenue to the divine.

[don’t like S-mas because it is an
exercise in unfounded beliefsi No,
I’m not talking about divine beings,
Yet I’m talkin' ’bout warm fuzziw,

But it‘s not all bad: there are better
punishments than withholding what
one already doesn't have. Any ste-

one I don‘t have to buy.

Just as some get more than they
deserve, there are many more who
get less than their just reward, When

that is the time to thank them. not in

weight does a potpourri pot carry
when it has to vie with GI, Joe and
Barbie? Constraining one’s appre-
ciation to one day of the year cheap-
ens the relationship. It’s like a dead-
line, and after the gift is given, then
the deed is done. The debt is paid.
And we all know it isn't.

Step 1 for Israel: Learning to Talk

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir is showing a dangerous lack
of perception in his approach to—
wards his own peace plan.

Sharnir's plan. which has under-
gone several revisions to make it
more acceptable toall sides,calls for
elections in Israel‘s occupied terri-
tories as an initial step towards reA
solving the Palestinian question, It
stands bogged down today because
Sharnir is now insisting on guaran-
teesthathewillnothavetodealwith
the P.L.O. in the process despite the
fact that the PLO. is, in one way or
another, a major player.

The P.L.O., insists Sharnir, are
still terrorists.

But even terrorists reform. S hamir
was a terrorist when he blew up the
King David Hotel in Jerusalem when
the British were ruling Palestine.
Nobody, not even the British gov-
ernment today, is still insisting on
his being labeledaterrorist Besides,
the PLO has ofﬁcially renounced
terrorism, although this is being
dismissed by Shamir as a public
relations ploy.

WORLD
WATCH

Shamir’s excessive paranoia about
the PLO. The Bush Administra-
tion, which has already begun con-
tacts with the P.L.O., is merely less
noisy aboutitsinitation.Two weeks
ago, when Shamirwas in the U.S. on
a visit he was told by 41 prominent
U.S. Jewish leaders that their'wanrtth
towards him should not be mismken
for support for his policies. Even his
own coalition partner, Shimon Peres,
is threatening to withdraw from the
coalition if Sharnir insists on reject-
ing the reath of the PLO‘

Sharnir remains stubbom and says
security for Israel is his concern. The
P.L,O. cannot be trusted to be sin—
cere, he claims.

What he refuses to accept is that
Israel is the most powerful nation in
the Middle East and the only one

with a nuclear capacity, that mod-
eration is the temperament of the
moment and that whoever still thinks
of pushing Israel into the sea has run
out of feasible ideas on how to do so,

Perhaps it’s time that the question
of Palestinian security was ad-
dressed?

The P.L.O. cannot afford to cheat
in the current Middle East peace
process. Its main power base is the
good will of the international coma
munityi The nations of the world
wouldbeasintransigentagainstPal-
estinian aggression as they have been
against Israeli aggression. The “ter-
rorism" of the P.L.O. was tolerated
because they were seen as under-
dogs. The world has less sympathy
for terrorism perpetrated by govem-
ments.

The only real ﬁrst step towards
peace in the Middle East is an attie
tude change. Only when each side
accepts who its enemy (or friend) is,
and is willing to tackle the nitty
gritty of the other side's legitimate
interests, will the dawn of peace fall
on battered Israel, on battered Pales-
tine,

 

Many people are annoyed with

Malta Summit This weekend Presidents Gor-
bachev and Bush will meet on warships in the Mediter-
ranean Sea, off the coastof Malta. What was described
by President Bush as an opportunity for the two leaders
to get to understand each other and exchange views on
several topics is expected to tum out to be a historic
occasion for international relations. Changes and trends
in Eastern Europe will be the main agenda. Bush has
said arms control would not
be a major issue but the
reduction of Soviet and
American troops in Europe
would be discussed,

Czechoslovakia In
one week Czechoslovakia
underwent dramatic change
as massive demonstrations
and a general strike led to
the resignation of Communist Party leader Milos lakes
and the entire Czech Politburo. The new premier, ML
Adamac, has promised free elections and the formation
of a coalition government with the opposition after
meeting Vaclav Havel, leader of the opposition party
Civic Fontm. On Tuesday the Communist Party en-
dorsed Adamac‘s proposal to eliminate the “leading
role" of the Communist Party and to do away with
Marxism-Leninism as the smte ideology.

Germany EastGennan leader Egon Krenz signed
an appeal circulated by EastGennan dissidents calling
for the maintenance of a socialist alternative to West
Germany. Krenz’ move was seen as a response to West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl‘s 10-point proposal
to reunitethe Gennanys, announced on Tuesday. Kohl‘ 5
plan anticipates free elections in East Germany leading
to a federation of the two states that would eventually
resultin reunification. The two leaders meet in Decem-
ber.

India Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi resigned Tuesr
day after the Congress Party lost its majority seats in
Parliament after national elections held this week. The
opposition National Front coalition, led by V. P. Sirtgh,
is expected to form a new government in collaboration
with other parties in Parliament, The Congress Party
and Rajiv Gandhi's family have dominated Indian
polities and run the government for 37 of the 41 years
since India attained independence from British rule.

once again as Syrian troops move within firing distance
of General Michel Aoun's enclave in Beirut. Christian

ity for the bombing murder. New PresidentElias Hraw
recently dismissed Aoun as
military commander after
demanding that Aoun end
his resistance to the Taif
peace plan. The Taif plan,
which advocates a greater

Hrawi as a “Syrian puppet"
