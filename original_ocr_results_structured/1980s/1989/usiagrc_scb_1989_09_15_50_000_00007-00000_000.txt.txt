"It was weird. We were ready but the
refs weren't there. "

Though the referees were two
hours late due to a scheduling misr
take, the Grinnell women’s soccer
team was victorious against Ripon
on Saturday,September9.The game
was the first in the Grinnell Invitar
tional Tournament, which included
Tarkio, Park and Ripon. The Grin-
nell women ﬁrst beat Ripon 6-0,
then Tarkio 3-1 to emerge as the
overall champions.

The team,playinginalightrainon
Saturday, scored one goal in the ﬁrst
half and pulled out five more in the
second. Susan Thomas’ comer kick
foundlennyWood’s footsomewhere
amidst a mass of writhing, kicking
feet, and the ball landed in the goal.
The team had scored against the
infamous Tracy Canard, rumored to
be one of the best soccer players in
the Midwest.

Canard certainly succeeded in
goal, keeping the Grinnell squad to
one goal. In the second half, how-
ever, her replacement could not
match Canard's ability and as the
team hit one ball after another to the
net — “Pepper them!“ urged Coach
Eskildsen, though the team latertricd
not to rub Sail in Ripon’s wounds 7
the score climbed to 670, Grinnell.

One almost felt sorry for the goalr
'keepcr as one body after another
crashed into her. Dani “A. O.
Kaopectate“ Aoki actually had her
on the ground for a few minutes and
the crowd waited, hushed, to see if
she would be all right. Moments
later, Grinnell began ﬁring shots
anew on the battered woman. Sara
Conner‘s aggression left its mark
and riled the team.

StepharrieReisdorf was a key player
in the next three goals. Reisddrf
passed the ball in front of the goalie
and Anya Schwartz knocked it in for
goal number three. For the fourth
goal, Mana “the Sparta" Fraboni
received the ball from Reisdorf and
for the fifth, the woman repeated the
play: Reisdorf to Fraboni to goal. If
it works...

Dani Aoki scored the women's
final goal. On the defensiveend, Jen
Hooper stopped Tracy Canard on
the ﬁeld with a vengeance. Once
again, Kathy Zabel, Nancy Kaiser
and Ris Taylor dared the other team
to even try to score. Asha Morgan.

efforts, but tumed their droughts to
Sunday’s game.

"I thought we raised our level of

play with the support of those people

at the game helping hr through."

Sunday proved to be a day of
triumph for the Grinnell women‘s
soccer team. The trophy proves it.

That‘s right. By beating Tarkio 3-
l,thc women won the Grinnell Invi-

 

the crowd out of the game and
showed marked improvement in all
facets of play.

Despite their loss to Iowa Confer-
ence powerhouse Wartburg in
straight sets of 157, 15-6, and l5—6,
the game was “a very well played
match against a strong and highly
experienced team." coach Sheila
Cain said.

“Everyone seemed more comfort-
able on me court and consequently
we played much more fundamen-
tally sound," Cain said. The statis-
tics add weight to her words: the
team serving was an impressive 88
percent, with three players success-
fully placing all of their serves.

As the team displayed their ability
to make quality passes, Lheiroffense
was even more effective. This

inch, simulated-gold winner‘s cup.
Yo, it‘s a trophy. okay?

Jenny Wood (gosh, that name
looks familiar) sailed the ball right
in front of the net on a comer kick.
allowing some nameless, facclcss
player (with a ball-bouncing bod) to
get one in the net. Woodar’s efforts
earned her the M.V.P. award. Heck,
when you’re buying trophies, might
as well get a lot!

Up l»0, the team stayed tough, but
a free kick awarded to Tarkio gave
them a chance to tie up the game.
Believe it ornot, Tarkio wore Umbro
American Longs also (there had to
have been a sale), and when the
direct kick was taken, the shorts
wielded their magic. The long kick
was in and the game was tied again.

Amy Reinhart, a freshman with a
fresh foot, crossed the ball smack
into the back of thenet. The Pioneers
were back on top, and with Li fabu-
lous effort by Susan Thomas playing
sweeper, stayed on top. Theicing on
the cake was a third and ﬁnal goal
from Stephanie Reisdorf, sending
Coach E. ﬂying downfteld, crying,
“This is a great group!"

achievement is a result of the great
time and effort devoted to practice
since last week's matches at Wil-
liam Penn. Defensively, the players
were also much at ease with Coach
Cain’s new system at each position.

Lengthy volleys caused the Pier
neers some difﬁculties, which Cain
attributed to the fact that the varsity
players have been scrimmaging
against the same team — the J.V.
squad — in order to gain experience
as a group. “Now we must step up a
level and provide more challenges
by splitting up the varsity members
and having them play against one
another," Cain said.

Adaptability is one of this team’s
apparent strengths. Each player has
been forced to adjust to playing in
many rotations, often with different
combinations of settersFortunately,
the freshmen are fitting in well and
quickly getting into the ﬂow of the
game.

Once each player teams the style
ofherteammates, the team will be in
a position to use all of its talents in
any situation. According to sopho»
more setter Amy Robinson, “We are

making the transition between a
group of individuals playing on the
same court and a team of individuals
working togetherand understanding
one another.”

The junior varsity squad gained
valuable experience in a match of
their own: however, Grinnell lost
the two-outrof-Lhree match»up to
Wartburg in two games.

Next, Grinnell is preparing to face
two Midwest Conference foes, Be—
loitand Ripon,as wellas Mundelein
and Rockford Colleges at the Beloit
Invitational. ThePioneers say they're
looking forward to playing. both
conference teams with the intention
of avenging close losses suffered at
the Conference play-offs last sea-
son,

Injuries have continued to plague
the team, sidelining starting setter
Sandy Tibbetts fora week and keep—
ing hitter Jennifer Hughes out of
competition for at least two weeks
more.

The women's volleyball team
plays its first home game nextTues-
day, Sept. 19, at 6 pm. in Darby
Gymnasium.
