coupled with VanSickle’s 32
points and 11 bounds enabled the
Pioneers to overcome an ll»point
deﬁcit with only three-and-a-half
minutes remaining.

Said a proud coach E.,
“Playing tired and coming from
behind, we showed an enormous
amount of character. This gives
us something to build on."

The Pioneers take their talent
on the road this weekend. playing
tonight at Monmouth, and then
tomorrow at Knox. Their next
home game is a week from
tomorrow (Feb 4) against
Illinois College. Revenge can be
awfully sweet.

the police have handled the situ-
ation. Finally, it may help the
police to know where and when
harassment takes place, especially
if there are several similar inci-
dents within a short time span.

The committee decided
against implementing an escort
service After they took a look at
the history of escort services at
Grinnell, they decided their en-
ergy would be better spent work-
ing on other things. Evidently
there have been escort services
started every two or three years
since the 1970s, including two in
the last four years. but they have
all failed due to very limited use
and great difficulty in finding
volunteers If you have a ques~
tion about any of these new pro-
grams, Matt Rickett is available
to answer your questions.

Chinese riots
Continued from Page 3

African students. (We did not
know where they were taken {or
almost 24 hours and one woman
was not released for nearly two
days.)

Shortly thereafter the Chinese
mobs broke through a police
blockade and stormed the train
station, Twenty Chinese were
reported injured in the ensuing
fight between police and students.

On December 27. since there
had been no demonstrations all
day, I felt it was safe to venture
out to teach my English class.
After class, as I rode my bicycle
home in the dark, I noticed
hundreds and hundreds of soldiers
lining the streets. As I ap-
proached the campus, I noticed
they had linked arms. Soon I
could see the sidewalks around
campus were filled with people
shouting and pushing against the
lines of police. I was very
scared

The next day, a friendly
noodlevshop proprietor warned us
that some foreigners—
Caucasians~had been assaulted
at the train station. It was
unclear to us what direction the
demonstrations would take. We
hoped [we were not in store for
another Boxer Rebellion.

The whole situation was very
complex, and the exact cause of
the demonstrations was unclear.
Was it simply prejudice against
the black Africans?
Dissatisfaction with the
government? Would it be long
before resentment against our
privileges as foreigners studying
in China would manifest itself in
a particularly violent and nasty
way? There was no way to tell.

Later that afternoon. taxi

lining up to get special letters of
introduction from the university
in order to leave.

I left Nanjing December 29
Since then I have read reports of
anti-African demonstrations in
Hangzhou, Beijing and Wuhan. I
know that in Nanjing the
govemment prohibited foreign
journalists from entering the city.
The wire services were dependent
on the reports made by us foreign
students, Since the later articles
on the spread of the
demonstrations came out during
winter break, I wonder how
accurate they were. I wonder
what was not reported.

demonstrations occur? An
