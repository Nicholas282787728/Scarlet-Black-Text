Why are you the best candidate for Student Government president?

Paul Froese

I feel like I represent this
campus like no one has ever
represented this campus before. in
the history of Grinnell. I feel
close to every student on this
campus. I've shared some nights
with some students on this
campus. I feel I know them. I
feel one With them. I am
Grinnell. Ich bin cin Grittnelll.

Roh Killian
To quickly restate some of
. the themes I said in my
statement, I am the bestcandidate
for president first of all because I
care about communication and
I‘ve done a lot this past year, and
I'll do a lot in the next year to
continue the communication

we've begun among the faculty.
the student body, SGA. anti the
atlniinisuation. In addition to
that communication. l have as
much as possible tried to be open
to suggestions from the student
body as to how to affect change
on the campus, and I think I've
been successful in a lot of those
attempts because, as I said in my
statement. I know who to go to,
I know how to propose change.
and I know that I have to be
persistent in following up tn my
initial request for change.

Simon Levin

My qualifications run a pretty
broad range. Being an SA lnatle
me privy to working with
Student Affairs and RAS. I've

What projects do you plan to work on if elected?

Paul Froese

Actually, I came up with an
idea‘tl’lat I like quite a bit. Here
it goes.

Personally, I don't want to go
to all the meetings, so I thought
we could have a sign-up sheet in
my ofﬁce and if you Wanted to be
president you would just sign up
and you would be president for a
week. You wouldn't be paid, but
on your resume you could put
that you were SGA president.
Another project, and this is
probably why I'm running for
president, is that I'd like to see
Grinnell become one huge, happy
family, I'd like to see people be

more open with each other. I'd
like to see lots of nudity, like
there is in my family. I'd like to
see people having fun. having
safe sex, out in the open even if
they want. Throwing the Frisbee
around, having a beer. laughing
with your friends. as one huge,
loving community. I think that
if we would do away with silly
rules and regulations, and just
accept each other for what we are.
we could have a hell of a time
here.

Rob Killion
As I said in my statement, in

 

problems with SGA?

Paul Froese
Boring, boring and more
boring.

Rob Killion

One problem with SGA is
that the role of a senator is in
many ways ambiguous. I think
many times the campus tends to
look at their senator or at Joint
Board as a synonym for SGA.
The senators, and many times the
Cabinet members as well. are
confused about what a senator's
role should be. because the day-
today opemtions of SGA are run
by the various Cabinet members.
The official role of the senators is
to approve all budgets that are
approved by SGA committees
and to act as a communications
link between the Cabinet, which
can become isolated from the
student body, and the student
body in their respective dorms or
off-campus houses. But the
question is, is that enough of a
role? Is that an adequate way of
giving senators a role in SGA. or
should senators have a greater
role? If they do have a greater
role, what would that be? So I

 

What do you think are the three biggest

think that one major problem is
that undefined role, or the
relatively ambiguous role of the
senator in the whole process of
SGA. And I think senators will
tell you the same.

Simon Levin

One is, last semester, the two
initiatives that passed by a vast
majority were not successful in
being instituted in the
administration’s policies, I put
some of the blame for that on
SGA, because after the initiatives
passed, they did little else but
inform the appropriate people
that this is what the students
wanted. They didn’t pressure
them. They didn’t help research
the proposals. I don’t feel that
they worked to make the
proposals a reality. Personally I
think SGA has done a really good
job with education of students
about SGA's policies and
capabilities. I’d like to see that
upheld. I congratulate them on
this year’s success. Personally, I
think the biggest change ['6 like
to see in SGA is me as president.

As SGA president, how will you do this job

Paul Froese

Well, Greg is the kind of a
guy with a cocktail glass in one
hand and your lapel in the other.
I‘ll just hold the cocktail glass.

Rob Killian

That’s a difficult question.
Greg and I are different people.
and to a certain extent we‘re of
course going to have different
styles of leading SGA. I think
.the major differencebetween
Greg‘s presidency and my own is

the projects that we have picked
to work on. This year, Greg has
chosen to work on projects that
are more campus-oriented. Greg
has looked in to seeing if the
smoking policy on campus can
be changed, he's worked with
housing policies, we've all
worked with the drinking
policies. and things of that
nature. As I said in my
statement, I will continue to
represent the students in that
way, but I would also like to

run a student initiative. I‘ve
shown an ability to affect change
where it is needed. Right now
as exemplified in my running
for president. I have a desire to
change and improve the campus.
That was part of the reason I
became an SA. Considering the
current candidates, I am certainly
a more serious candidate than
Paul Froese, but I think I bring 2i
little bit more humor to the job
than Rob Killian. I’m pretty
well aware of the system and
have worked with administrators
and faculty. I’ve mlkcdrto them
about affecting changes. I'm
aware of the initiative system.
I‘m aware of what SGA docs and
what it doesn‘t do. I‘m very clear
about what my goals are.

addition to all the little
bureaucratic tasks that are
inevitable when you're in the
position of president or vice
president, I would like to spend
the remaining time working on
projects such as community-
serviccorientcd activities. These
could be food and clothing drives
for the Second Mile Pantry, or
organizing food collections from
Dining Services. local grocery
stores, and restaurants for a
service organization in town that
can then transport the food to
people who need it. Things of
that nature.

Simon Levin

If elected I'm going to pursue
making SGA student~
representative. Another change.
today I have been talking to Dave
McConnell and Diane Daugherty
about changing the policy that if
you live on campus. you have to
be on board. Currently. the only
way to be part of the campus
community and be off board is
through the co»ops and that's
only 65 slots: 63 in co-op houses
and two in Cleveland. Thatquotz
is under par; there's not as many
people taking up those slots.
What I want to do is make it
available for people who live on
campus in the dorms to go off
board. This would be prioritized
for people who are vegetarians
and are dissatisﬁed with the food,
people with dietary restrictions
who feel that food service is not
adequately serving their needs.

Last on the prioritizing list
would be people who just want
to cook for themselves. Include
in that, the school looking for
healthier food sources. I think
the kitchens in the dorms are
adequately equipped for this
purpose with the stoves, sinks.

 

and now microwaves.

How much experience do you have in
dealing with faculty and administration?

Paul Froese

I see faculty every day, so I
have constant interaction with
them. The administration‘s a
little different story. But I
remember. I think it was last
Tuesday, I was sitting in one of
the dining halls and kind of a tall
man with glasses sat down next
to me, and low and behold it was
George Drake. We talked a little
about the tuna salad and, I
remember this vividly because he
had this kind of silk power tie on
and I thought he looked really

.sharp. I thought to myself, I'd

really like to get to know this
man better because, you know
I‘ve heard he’s a Rhodes Scholar.
So I think I could really benefit
from meeting with him regularly.
and I look forward to it.

Rob Killion

Quite a bit, actually. I
hesitate to compare myself to
George Bush, but in some ways I
guess we're similar in that, as
vicerprcsidcnt. I‘ve had the
opportunity to gain a great deal
of experience in working with the
administration and especially
with the faculty because as the
vice-president I work with
curricular issues and meet with
Sandy Moffett, the chair of the
faculty, [and] Charlie Duke, the
dean of the faculty. and work
with the faculty on curricular
issues all the time. In addition to
that, Greg and I both meet with
George Drake. Wally Walker, and
the major administrators in
general about every other week.

So I guess I feel that I have a
great deal of experience, and I feel
that that experience is essential to
being a good president. It takes a
certain amount of time to get
used to the position, in learning
which administrator can do what
for you, what each
administrator’s personality is
like. what you can and cannot
say, how much of the whole
uuth are you being told and how
much of the truth aren‘t you
being told. And that takes a
while to learn. and it takes a
while to discern. I have that part
of the learning experience behind
me.

Simon Levin

I consider quite a few faculty
and administrators as my friends.
Among them are Steve Jones,
Floyd Akins, Diane Doughcrty.
Among the faculty are Mr.
Cervcnc, Colin Sacks. I work
closely with Dave Lopatto,
Emily Moore, Monys Hagen. I
have a good working relationship
with all of them. Idon’t Consider
myself to be so much as a
student approaching a faculty
member or administrator. I
approach them on more of a peer
level. I think I will be effective
in working with them in
changing things around campus.
My qualiﬁcations are such that I
have worked with administrators
and faculty. Even those that I
don't care for much as friends. I
have developed a working
relationship with, people such as
Dave McConnell.

What will be your most important Cabinet,

appointment?

Paul Froesc
That would have to be the
masseuse.

Rob Killion

The assistant treasurer, for a
number of reasons. First of all,
the assistant treasurer will
automatically be a two-year
Cabinet member,'bccause they
will become the treasurer the
following year. That means they
will be one of the few Cabinet
members who will be assured a
second year, and therefore will be
one of the few Cabinet members
that can assure continuity
between different Cabinets
because there tends to be a lot of
turnover from year to year. Also
because the treasurer's office is
arguably the most important
office, as far as student services
go, in the SGA ornee. SGA has
approximately a $160000 budget
and it's a complicated process
keeping track of hundreds of little
floor funds, hall funds. student-
group funds and sports—club

differently than ureg Evans has?

place more of an emphasis on
campus-town relations and
projects that the town and
campus can do togedtcr.

Simon Levin

Ijust talked to Greg Evans
today. In discussion with him
we broached the fact that he didn't
make some of the changes that he
originally planned to. He feels
like he's done a very good job,
but he's felt like he could do
more. One thing I want to do is

make SGA more of a student-
rcpresenlative organization. I
could do this by creating a
researching committee that would
research student initiatives and
the ways of making them reality.
The committee would submit
proposals to administrators and
impress administrators. This
would make SGA more of a
studentebacking organization. I
think that's one of the main
improvements that needs to be
made in SGA right now.

funds. It takes a person first of
all who is willing to commit a
lot of time. and secondly that you
are going to have to trust with a
lot of money and a lot of freedom
with that money.

Simon Levin

Because of the change in the
drinking policy, the person who
heads the All-Campus Events
Committee is going to be an
important appointment. They
will have to make decisions that
will best represent the students.
Also, the social coordinator is
involved in that. They have a
large budgetand that will need to
be handled well. So those two
positions directly. Also. with
the creation of an initiative-
researeh committee, the person
who's going to spearhead that
will have to be a responsible,
reliable, hardworking person
who has a good relationship with
faculty and administrators and is
able to dig deep in the system to
go information on the student
initiatives. And I'm going to
have to have a good working
relationship with that person

because I fully intend to work
closely with that person in
making this a successful
