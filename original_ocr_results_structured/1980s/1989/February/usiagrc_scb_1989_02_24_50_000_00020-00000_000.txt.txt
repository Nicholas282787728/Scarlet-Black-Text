Hoopsters dismantle Iowa Pioneers unstoppable,

Wesleyan in final outing

by Bob Litton

Thursday was a special night

for Grinnell College athletics.

First and foremost. the
women's basketball team crushed
Iowa Wesleyan 89-64 in front of
a boisterous crowd in oarhy,
What‘s more. the victory boosted
the Pioneer's record to season-
ending 1w, a vast improvement
over last year's dismal 5.17 mark.
But most importantly, senior
guard Jessica "Sammy " Toft was
playing her final game in a Pier
necr uniform.

Grinnell completely domir
noted the smaller Tigers in the
onset. Sharp shooting and a
hounding defense enabled the Pi-
oneers to go on a 216 rttn with
nearly 10 minutes gone by in the
first half.

Iowa Wesleyan couldn't den
sign the appropriate defense to
contain the home team. vlf they
collapsed into a two-three zone,
the Pioneers would break it with
outside jumpers from sophomore
Jennifer "Pasha" Sprelnulli. And
if the Tiger decided to match up,
Grinnell would nonclialantly go
inside to phenom center Laura
VanSickle, who had yet another
standout performance wtllt 32
points an 16 boards.

This being tlte case, it ap
peared like it was going to be a
simple blow out. But Grinnell
suddenly went ice cold from the
floor. Their dwindling offense
managed only seven points in the
next ﬁve minutes. Tllis allowed
Iowa Wesleyan to slowly arve
into the once monstrous load, and
at the half it stood at only eigllt.
3-1-26.

In the opening moments of
the second half, the two squads
traded hoops each time down the
floor. Eventually, however. the
significance of the moment
dawned on Ted Eskildscn's crew:
hey. this was Jesse's last game;
they simply had to bury this
team!

No sooner said than done.
Grinnell regained their soft
shooting, sparked in part by

freshman ienny Wood, and
slowly but surely pulled away
from the visrtors. A VanSiekle
Iuyrup gave Grinnell it's biggest
lead of the night, 7347. witll
6:33 to play. The lat lady was
howlin' away.

The Pioneers have to be ex
tremely proud of their season.
They are a very young squad
l0 out of the 16 players are
freshmen and made
insurmountable leaps and bounds
frotn last season. This squad will
undoubtedly be heard from in the
years to come.

As for Jessica. well. as usual.
she went out in style. We'll
miss you. and we love you.
Thanks for Lhe memories,

Talk about going out in
style! You couldn't have written
a sweeter ending to a Season.

The Grinnell men's
basketball team closed out their
season Tuesday evening With a
96760 thrashing of a hapless
Mount St. Clare bunch. Their
257point margin of victory is the
largest in five years (in 1985 the
Pioneers beat Monmouth 102-
81). bringing their season-long
tally to 448. In so detng,
Grinnell avenged a 97~76 loss to
the academically ineligible
visitors (Mount St. Clare has
enough players who didn’t make
grades to field a whole new squad)
earlier Li'tis year.

Most important, however, ts
the fact that Grinnell finished the
year in a flurry. It will make the
off-season all Lhe more enjoyable.

Prior to this storybook finale.
the Pioneers suffered a pair of
defeats to Knox and Illinois
College, 76-73 and 70-52
respectively. As usual. the
statistics reveal only a portion of
the picture.

The Pioneers went tnto the
weekend series drastically shorts
handed to say the least. Center
Chris Jacobson, forward George
Meiimsey. and guard/captain
Mike Spurbeck were all sidelined
due to illness or injury. In
losing by only three on the
second-placed Siwash‘s home
court—with four chances to wtn
in the final minute—and eut-
rcbounding Knox along Lhe way,
the Pioneers deserve a great deal
ofcredit.

Assessing the Knox game.
Coach Westlund claimed. “That
was the best game we‘ve played
since I’ve been here at Grinnell
(two years). We executed our
game plan perfectly, everyone
fulfilling their respective roles.
All seven guys who played did a
superb job.”

Tuesday night was a different
story. lacobsen was healthy
again. Grinnell was playing at
home in front of a sparse yet
wonderfully surly crowd. And it
was senior Phil "Daddy”
Kantzler’s last game of his
college career. The Pioneers
knew they had to "win one for
the Daddy."

Dick Vitale, the loquacious
color commentator for college
basketball who lives and dies for
the acronym. would term
Tuesday's debacle an “NC": a no
contest, baby! The Pioneers
controlled all aspects of the game
from the opening tip. a feat
unseen by this reporter in his
four years of covering Grinnell
men‘s hoops.

Grinnell didn't mess around
with this one. Before you were
settled on the plush Darby
bleachers. the Pioneers were up
1876. By the time (3:41 left on
the clock) Kantzlcr buried a pair
of free throws. it was 37717. The
good guys went into the locker
room comfortably ahead 4425.

son in a flurry

Freshman Steve Howlantl drives in for two of his galllc- ‘
high 2‘) points in Grilincll’s 96760 lnatiling of Mt. St. Clare.

The second tutti: same story,
different channel. Alter Mount
St. Clare’s allrl‘reshmen squad
would execute their complex
offense—one pass and a missed
shot from 27 feeticrinnell
would cruise down the floor and
score again and again. They were
up by as many as 32 after Bill
Coilin's reverse lay-up with 3:30
remaining. Just a walk in the
park, baby.

Needless to say. Westlund
was pleased with his team’s
effort. “I‘m proud of the way
they demonstrated themselves out
there. They had that killer
instinct which you need to win in
this league. They took care of
their opponent. never letting
them back in the game. That
was the best part of it all," he
said.

The Pioneers also had a good,
balanced offensive attack. as four
players scored in double figures.
Steve Howland led all scorers
with 29. Dave Chamberlain
knocked in 13. Jacobscn had 14
and BJ. Iahn added 12 points in
the sliellacking.

Despite the illustrious win,
however. there are a few minor
regrets lingering in my mind.
For one. scoring 100 would have
been something special. But
even more‘ irktng is the fact that
Tuesday marked my final
Grinnell College basketball
game, Win or lose, it Will be

sorely missed. ‘

In an overview of the entire
season. Westlund said, “The
players matured. both as ‘
individuals and as a team, xix the
season wore on. They real .etl
that they had to play ilnrti,
execute, and be productive each
titnc out on the floor. The guys
kept plugging away all season _
long. never quitting." He
concluded. “They improved
tremendously."

Westlund has reason to be
optimistic about the forthcoming
season as well. The Pioneers are
a very talented. young team.
Losing only one senior. Grinnell
will not disrupt their tight
chemistry, that illusive ideal
essential to a quality ball club.
Remember. they're building a
program here.

This year's freshmen class
has provided a solid base for this
builiding process. Shaan
Hamilton has proved he’s a
player. while Jacobsen has shown
himself a force to be reckoned
with in the middle. And then
there's Steve Howland.

In his last three games.
Howland scored an average of 29
points. A dead-eye from three»
point land. he has a legitimate
shot at surpassing Denny Blyly
as Grinnell‘s all-time leading
scorer and leading the Pioneers to
a host of victories along the way.

My only regret is that I won't
be here to see it.
