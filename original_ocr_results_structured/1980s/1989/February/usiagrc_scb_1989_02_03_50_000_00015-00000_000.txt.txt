Buddhas power way to
second in Invitational

by Laura Whitmore

Grinncll’s men‘s swim team
had another great outing at the
C00 Invitational, finishing
second with 566 points. The
University of Wisconsin, a
Division-II team, won with 842
points. Grinnell beat tradition-
ally tough rivals Creighton (to
whom, you might remember,
Grinncll lost by a more it points
the week before). University of
Wisconsin, Steven‘s Point, and
Mankato. Coe and Buena Vista
rounded out the field.

Everyone on the team swam
well. contributing to the strong
finish, There were quite a few
stellar performances. In diving,
Phil Bishop won both the 1M
and 3M diving events. qualifying
for Divisionrlll nationals in both.
He also broke his previous
school record for the 3M whieh
qualified hiin for DiVision-I
nationals. (The trick is that he
has to place first in Division Ill
in order to compete in Divtston

_I). Not bad for at weekends
work,

Dave Ressner continues to
amaze, winning three out of the
four cvcnis which he entered. He
set a freshman record for the 100
butterfly, and a varsity and meet

record in the 400 IM. Ressncr
may be joining Bishop at
nationals, as he is only seconds
away from qualifying in the 400
IM. I think it’s fair to conclude
that these are all outstanding
performances.

John Williams and Joe
Zimscn weren’t slouches, either.
Both finished in the top six of all
events they were entered in. Torn
Nelson turned in a strong
performance as well, contributing
to the team’s score, Kevin
Docrschug and Steve Clem
flniSth second and third
respectively in the backstroke.
David Troy swam wcll tn
distance races, particularly the
mile. And the ZOO-medley relay
teatn of Docrschug, Nelson,
Anderson. and Williams took
second place, Congratulations to
the whole team on a job wellr
done.

This weekend the Pioneers
travel to Northeast Missouri
state, a team they've performed
well against in the past. Coach
Obcrmillcr is confident they’ll
swim well again as they begin to
wind down their season. There
are only two meets after this one
before conference.

Super Bowl: no
action, all hype

by Howard Gardos

Super Bowl XXIII has finally
come to a close. The experts are
calling it one of the greatest
Super Bowls ever played, if not
the greatest. In comparison to
some of the recent one-sided
Super Bowls, such as the
Chicago Bears 42-6 romping of
the New England Patriots and the
NY. Giants 38—9 Win over the
Denver Broncos, San Francisco’s
last minute 20-13 victory last
Sunday stacks up just fine.

The game went down to the
wire with the Nincrs' Joe
Montana, the most polished
professional quarterback in
football, knocking off the
Bengals‘ Boomer Esiason, the
winner of this season’s Most
Valuable Player award.

But what was this Super
Bowl really about‘.7 Was it really
about grabbing victory from
defeat as the seconds ticked down,
about Jerry Rice making
phenomenal catches and Ickey
Woods barrcling through line-
mcn‘]

About halfway through the
game, the realization set in
throughout my dorm lounge that
the Super Bowl was second in
importance this afternoon.

at Monmouth—Coach Westlund
didn't have all that much to be
cheerful about. “We weren't
mentally ready to play the ball
games," Wesdund said.

So what was tltc highlight
during this sad cscapadc at Darby?
Without a doubt it was the
halftime entertainment provided
by Grinnell’s own third- and
fourth-graders. Always a Lreali
keep it up, fellas,

With all this bad news aside.
this weekend has a fresh slate of
games in which the Pioneers are
privileged to dabble. Tonight
Grinncll faces di\‘i$l0nricﬂding
Knox at 7:30 p.m., and
tomorrow they square up against
Illinois College at 1:30 p.tn,
The fun, or so we'll hope,
continues Tuesday at 7:30 pm.
when the Pioneers welcome
Monmouth.

 

People continually walked into
the room for an update. not on
the Super Bowl, but rather on the
Bud Bowl, one of the most
hyped, utterly stupid advertising
campaigns in a long, long time.
Yet with every update excitement
filled the room, with the majority
of the room pulling for Bud, and
only a firm but small minority
chwring on Bud Light.

You didn‘t need the special 3-
D glasses to notice that the
halftime show, like the game.
was too long and too slow. The
first quarter alone lasted 67
minutes—not exactly on the
standard three~hour or so game
pace during the regular season.
The Elvis impersonator was
simply too much after a Cowtes
dinner.

They did actually play some
football in between all the SD
and Bud Bowl updates, beer/Coke
commercials and replays of
broken legs in slow motion.
And as it tumed out. the second
half was pretty exciting. The
Super Bowl might not get better
every year, but the commercials,
and the games, get longer.

half. Iulie Kastcr lcxl all Grinncll
scores with 14 points. On
Saturday a much rested Knox
team was able to apply full-court
pressure on a very tired Grinnell
learn and run away with a 91-61
victory. Laura VanSicklc scored

20 points and grabbed l1 re-
bounds against the Siwash.

The Pioneers are hoping to
rebound and maintain their hold
on third place with a solid per»
formance against Illinois College
on Saturday. Game time is It
a.m. The Pioneers lost to LC.
earlier in the season. and they are
looking forward tO returning the
favor. A large and enthusiastic
(excuse me, I mean obnoxious)
crowd would definitely ltelp turn
the tide.
