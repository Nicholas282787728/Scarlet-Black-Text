‘T AND BLACK

A brief guide to Grinnell's fine dining

by Heather Tonence

Tonight when you go to
dinner, be careful to notice the
fine quality of Grinnell food.
Enjoy the aroma, the texture, and
the flavor of your carefully
chosen entrie. dessert, salad, and
drink because you are eating at
one the nation‘s finest college
cafeterias.

Now that I’ve shocked you, I
have to tell you, it‘s true. Our
Dining Services, headed by Dave
McConnell, has been nominated
for Restaurant and Institutions
magazine‘s prestigious Ivy
Award. Grinnell, along with
Bryn Mawr, Kent State, and
various other institutions, was
nominated to honor its excellent
food service. The award will be
given in May at the annual
industry meeting.

A quick glance over the six-
wcck rotating menu plan proves
why Grinnell College was
nominated. Where else can you
find pizza, felafel patties, green—
pea soup. liver and onions.
spaghetti with tofu sauce, rice
checseburgers, four»layer dessert,

turkey laws, and three kinds of
quiche all in one week? For your
future reference, here is a brief
review of some of Grinnell’s
lnore tempting offerings, one
from each week of the menu.

WEEK ONE: French Dip Sand-
wtches uu Ius. The idea is a
traditional one, Beef between
two slices of French bread, served
with a sauce, (the au jus, of
course). The sandwiches are quite
normal, but dunking them is
sometimes a problem since
Dining Services puts the au jus
in tiny plastic cups that only the
very comer of your sandwich will
fit in. If you aren't concerned
about cleanliness, pour the sauce
over your sandwich. *****

WEEK TWO: Beef and

Mushroom Turnovers. If this
dish sounds unfamiliar, it's
probably because you‘re used to
calling them “death triangles."
This tasty little pastry treat is
undoubtedly the menu‘s most
famous offeringr In fact, if you
know any prospectives who are
coming to visit, warn them about
Week Two, Mondays. *

WEEK THREE: Health Nut
Bagels. The bagel is soft,
slightly chewy, best served
warm. The accompanying cream
cheese is grayish with flecks of
carrots running through it. This
is served with regular cream

cheese for those who are less
health- and more taste-conscious.

WEEK FOUR: Banana Split
Dessert. This is supposed to
taste like a banana split?
Apparently not. It isn’t bad, if
you want a sugar high or have a
whipped-cream fetish. A popular
dessert item, this is one actually
served in the real world, maybe
by your mother. ““*

WEEK FIVE: Felafel Patty.
The name made me curious.
What exactly is felafcl? No one
serving seemed to know;
undoubtedly they had opted for
Creamed Seafood over Patty

Shell and Colorless Dutch Apple
Pie. At any rate, it has a distinct

aroma and a fascinating texture.
an

WEEK SIX: Baby Whole
Carrots. They seem harmless
enough. What could be more
innocent than cute little carrots
sitting in a tiny bowl? They are
a bit bland and can be squeezed
into a wateredrdown version of
carrot jutee. No one seems to
know how that tnueh liquid gets
into a baby carrot, but an
industrious bio major could
probably turn it into a research
project. **

If all this frightens you.
consider the fact that Dave
McConnell says of the six»week
menu, “I can’t pick a favorite
(dish). I like everything." The
Ivy Award will be awarded in
May. If we win, perhaps
prospective students will flock to
Grinnell in search of the nation’s
best institutional food. If not,
students will still have to wonder
what it can possibly be like in
less»honored colleges.

Single—Child policy clashes with Chinese mores

by May-lee Chai

Perhaps the most
controversial of all of China‘s
policies is the One-Child Family
Planning Program under which a
married couple is officially
allowed to have one child and no
more.

The One-Child Policy has not
been entirely successful, to say
the least, and the government has
already abandoned its target of a
1.05 billion population by the
year 2000. A population of L3
billion is now projected.

I knew that one of the reasons
for the failure of the policy is the
desire for couples to have a boy.
Daughters usually leave home
after marriage and move in with
their in-lztws whereas sons are
expected to care for their parents
in old age and carry on the farnily
line, In an effort to ensure that
the couple's one child is a boy,
abortions of female fetuses and
female infanticides have
increased.

I had also read that in the
countryside the economic
incentives for having a boy were
instrumental in the failure of the
peasants to comply willingly. In
the cities the economic incentives
to have a boy were not so strong,
and ofﬁcial publications had said
city-dwellers tended not to care
whether they had a boy or a girl.

I wondered to what extent
economics and laws could
override traditional cultural
values. My readings had left me
confused. I decided to ask the
students in the English class I
taught how they felt about the
boyvbabywersus-girl-baby issue.

After all, they were urbanites and
fairly well—educated. If additional
values were changing, I felt they
would surely show this.

“How many of you would
prefer to have a girl baby?"

Only one man raised his
hand. “I already have a girl," he
said, grinning sheepishly.

“How many do not care either
way?"
Another man raised his hand.

With a sinking feeling, I
asked, “How many would prefer
to have a boy?"

Only four of the ZO-some
people who had not yet voted
raised their hands: an editor for a
local university press, a
newspaper reporter, and two
factory technicians. I was
surprised. These were not the
people I would have expected to
respond in this way. I asked
thcnt to explain why they
preferred a boy, hoping the other

 

 

 

 

 

 

students would feel more free to
express their opinions after
hearing them.

“A boy has more chances to
succeed," said the editor. “Many
girls graduate and can‘t ﬁnd jobs.
Factories don‘t want them."

“Why not?" I asked

He thought for a moment,
“Well, for example, take the
press. In Beijing, if people start
picketing, I could go to cover it.
But one girl can‘t go They need
to send two girls because it‘s not
safe for one."

I turned to the reporter in the
class. Although she had stated
her preference for a boy, I
thought surely she would defend
women as journalists. “What do
you think?" I asked.

“Men are more creative than

girls," she said. (Most Chinese -

refer to women as “girls.")
“Do you know men who are
more creative?"

“Yes." she said, nodding her
head. She said that at her
newspaper two-thirds of the staff
were men. “They have more
ideas—new ideas—and dare to do
things."

One of the factory workers
who had not voted suddenly piped
up. “It‘s a physical thing.
That‘s why they don't get hired.
They get pregnant. Factories
lose a worker for about a year.

That’s a lot of loss for the
factory."

I steered the conversation
back to the question of boy and
girl babies.

A woman who was studying
English in the hopes of
becoming a translator for a joint-
venture business motioned that
she would like to speak "Those
