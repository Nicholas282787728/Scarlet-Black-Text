Pioneer woes drag on and on

by Bob Lifton

The same sour, old note is
getting played over and over
again, and it’s becoming quite
monotonous.

The Pioneer men’s basketball
team endured three more painful
defeats this past week, bringing
their season dmdgery to a meek
241 Two last-second weekend
losses at home. 72-69 to
Lawrence and 77-74 to St
Norbert, can be singled out as the
most frustrating. Wednesday’s
96—67 pounding at Monmouth
was no picnic, either, but it
wasn‘t as emotionally
debilitating as the defeats in
Darby.

Both games were lost by a
combined six points, both were
lost in a manner of seconds, and
both were contests from which
the Pioneers could have walked
away victorious. They played
their tails off for 40 minutes,
coming up oh-so-close, only to
lose in the waining moments.
That’s what makes these defeats
particularly difﬁcult to swallow

Friday night’s game against
the Lawrence Vikings began as a
fast-paced, hot shooting affair.
Bill Collins‘ reverse inside put
the Pioneers up 21-20 at the
midway point of the first half.
George Mchmsey’s scoop in
traffic made it 30-27 two-and-a-
half minutes latert

Grinnell started to open up its
lead a bit in the closing minutes,
Tough offense boards (one of the
Pioneer's missing links as of
late) by Bali Jahn and a dime
pointer by captain Mike
Spurbeck put the good guys up
44-36.

Threading his way past three
Lawrence defenders. Holland Neal
gave Grinnell its biggest margin
at 10. 46-36, with less than a
minute remaining in the half.
But the Vikings continued to
hang close, cutting the halftime
edge to a mere ﬁve, 4641,

Both teams were sluggish in
the second half. A three-on-two
fast break from Neal to

Sophomore guard Holland Neal (12) eyes Viking opponent in Grinnell's heartbreak-
ing 72769 last second loss to Lawrence Friday.

McIitnsey gave Grinnell a 58—57
lead with 9:07 left to play. The
squads see-sawed hack and forth,
neidtcr ever taking control of the
ball game. It appeared that it
would come down to a lasr shot

The‘deciding factor that
eventually tipped the scale in
favor of Lawrence was the
Pioneers’ inability to contain two
key Vikingst Matt Miota, a 5-
foot—lO (and that‘s stretching it)
guard penetrated at will, while
forward Shawn Koerncr rained
jumpers on any dreams of a
Grinnell parade, missing only
once all evening.

After a pair of three-pointers
by Kocrner which put the
Vikings up by a deuce, Chris
Iacobson (he paced Grinnell with
16) made a sweet move in the
paint to knot it at 63 with three
minutes remaining. An amazing
scoop from out of nowhere by

Miota made it 69-67. Jacobson
answered again, this time with
:45 left, with a soft baseline
jumper. Start biting those nails.

The scene is set. Game tied
at 69. Shot clock is off.
Lawrence can hold it for the last
shot And who do they go to?
Who else? Their mohey-man,
Koerner, who nonchalantly
canned a “3" with seven ticks left
on the clock

The Pioneers did manage to
get off a desperation last-second
shot, but it fell short, sealing the
victory for Lawrence, 72-69

Saturday’s matchup with the
other Wisconsin team proved no
less disconcerting. The Pioneers
trailed for most of the ﬁrst half.
going an entire five minutes
without a hoop against St.
Norbert‘s defense. Grinnell
finally managed to put together a
run in the ﬁnal minutes of the

first half. thanks in part to eight
points by Dave Chamberlain. At
the half they trailed by only one,
32-3 1,

As with the previous
evening, the two teams hung
neck and ncck for virtually the
entire second halft That little
separationiduo in part to poor
free-throw shooting by the Pio-
neersiwas the difference in the
ballgame.

A three-point play by Neal
coupled with a Chamberlain "j"
gave the Pioneers the lead 74-73
with :50 remaining Unlike the
Lawrence game, however, this
contest came down to the line.
Poised and confident, the Green
Knights buried their free throws
to steal the victory 75-74.

In the wake of these
heartbreaking losses—capped off
by Wednesday‘s 29-point debacle

The black quarterback: no longer

by Bob Lifton
Before the final nails are
hammered into the coffin to lay
to rest the issue of black
quarterbacks, I wanted to get in
my two cents,
I was reclining at home Jan.
2. watching the feast of bowl
games on TV. It was a college-
football junkie’s delight:
comfortable couch, appropriate
munchies and beverages, and
topped off with a remote control
to zoom back and forth between
,the myriad of games, seven in
all.
While ferociously ﬂipping
channels between games#from

the Cotton to the Hall of Fame
Bowl, or Sugar to Orange
Bowl—I noticed an interesting
phenomenon which only recently
had been the focus of attention in
the sports world, namely the
increased number of black
quarterbacks.

Particularly after quarterback
Doug Williams led the
Washington Redskins to victory
in Super Bowl XXII, capturing
Most Valuable Player honors
along the way, there has been an
emphasis placed on the dearth of
black quarterbacks in professional
football Why were blacks so

underrepresented at this pivotal
position when they comprised an
estimated 60 to 65 percent of the
National Football League?
Theories used to explain this
long-standing injustice are as
asinine as they are illogical.
Whites who perpetuated this
inequality held steadfast to the
ridiculous notion that blacks
lacked the intellectual capabilities
needed to play the quarterback
position. Quarterbacks must be
able to read various defenses,
calling audibles where necessary.
The critics maintained that this
task was somehow “too

complicated" for blacks,
especially in the pro game in
which the QB must continually
face a variety of elaborate zone
coverages.

Similar stereotypes once sur—
rounded the middlerlinebacker
position. the “quarterback" of the
defense, who is called upon to
read the offensive maneuverings.
Blacks successfully hurdled this
obstacle, however. Today the
two best linebackers, Mike
Singlctary of the Bears and
Lawrence Taylor of the Giants,
are black. The quarterback issue
has unfortunately proved to be a
