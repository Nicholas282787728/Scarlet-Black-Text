Trustees to hold
Spring meeting

May10-

by Kim Eckart

The Grinncll College board of
trustees will meet May l1 and 12
in Grinnell. The spring agenda
includes the approval of faculty»
tenure and reeontraeling deci-
sions, the financing of the reno»
vations of ARH and the Harris
Center, the future of Goodnow
and Steiner Halls, and a discus—
sion of the housing policy.

According to President
George Drake, this is a more
general meeting than last winter’s
annual evaluation of the budget.
There are a few new committees;
in order to focus exclusively on
development and fundraising, the
finance committee has been di-
vided into budget, investment,
and audit committees.

Although Drake refers to the
muehrdisputot‘l housing policy as
an “open issue,“ he doesn’t ex-
pect any alterations. ”The board
has the ultimate review of the
policy, and we will discuss itl
But I don‘t anticipate any
changes," he said. When the
Scarlet and Black contacted
Melanie Cooley, whose request
to live off campus with her lover
sparked a chain of events that uln
timately led to Drake‘s veto of a
change in the housing policy, she
said that neither she nor any of
her supporters had made plans to
take action at the meeting.

The board will also discuss
the funding of a program to en-
courage low~income Des Moines
sixth-graders to attend college.
