Dykens' research
sheds light on heart
attack damage

What do mussels, squid.
scallops, Iowa, and heart-attack
research have in common’.7 To
James A. Dykens, assistant pro-
l'essor of biology and resident
marine biologist, these diverse
elements are vital links in his rc-
searelt into the relationship be
tween shore-dwelling marine life
and the human heart attack.

Dykens’ research involves the
study of how intertidal marine
invertebrate animals are able daily
to tolerate oxygen denial and re-

supply due to the ebb and flow of
the tides. Although the discovery
of the biological mechanisms
which allow the animals to
tolerate these adverse conditions
is in itself important, there may
be additional signiﬁcance attached
to this research, Dykens believes
that the process of oxygen denial
and rcsupply in invertebrates such
as mussels, scallops, and squid is
similar to what is known to cor
cur during a human heart attack.
