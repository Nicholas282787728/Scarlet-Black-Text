0n the Peace Movement and
Social Activism in general

I used to think peace a Neat
Thing. I used to think birthday par4

while I did get more presents, they
really weren ’t any better than what

Peace. Irealtzc, is not entirely
the same animal. I

poetscould have justzis easily been
a bunch of Nazi Lruckdrivcrs or
nuns who toked and a lot of my
friends would have been crashing
at their apartments just the same.
While the peace mo ment is
not so shallow as this. it is damn
close. Peace and brotherhood are
deemed Good Things, and those
who follomed Folks That’sall.
There is no real substance to the
peace movement. Sure, there area

People who lltrow btrthday par-

others to know about it. Or they
want to bc that way. People are

(Not that social activism is a di—
rect corollary to peace, mind you.
If the starving masses of West
Africa ever do get the food-relief
efforts sent, it simply means they
can fight the spread of godless
communism more readily on a full
stomach. that’s all. Nonetheless,
most blur the distinction between
concrete movements and the ab—

Noyce made the basic discov—

was the first to propose the use of
silicon. which immediately Set. the

Dykens

By discovering the invertebrates’
tolerance mechanisms, the re-
search may lead to discoveries of
how to minimize the amount of
tissue damage in heart-attack vic-
tims.

Dykens’ earlier research, in
collaboration with Dr. Malcom
Shick of the University of Maine
and two Grinnell College stu-
dents, has already suggested a
number of reasons why some in
vertebrates tolerate reexygenatien
while others die from its effects.
These encouraging results have
helped him land a National Sci—
ence Foundation grantand a Har-
ris faculty fellowship.

Dykens was awarded the NSF
grant in mid~Decembcr I988.
The $130,929 grant will provide
Dykens with the funds needed to
finance his research for the next
three years, starting June 1,
1989. In addition, for the next
three’ summers, he will be able to
introduce two to three students to

This gives him a one-year leave
of absence during the 1989-90
academic year in which he will be
able to collaborate with other re
