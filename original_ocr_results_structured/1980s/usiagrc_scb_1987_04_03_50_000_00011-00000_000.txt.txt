Golf Goes
To

Galveston

by Darin Vig

The Grinnell College men's golf team
spent an excellent week in Texas over spr-
ing break in preparation for the upcoming
golf season. Coach Edd Bowers, Clint
Korver, Sam Lowe, Mark Gottreich, Brent
Jones, and Darin Vig left Grinnell early
Thursday morning, March is, and drove 14
hours, the maximum allowed by Grinnell
College policy, to Tyler, Texas. There,
they meta sixth team member, Dave Ship-
pert. The first night was spent in the
Sheraton Towers in Tyler; expenses paid
by a man who is a friend of a Grinnell alum
who is a friend of Coach Bowers.

The next_day the team drove to Beaur
mont, Texas, and played golf at Beaumont
Country Club as guests of Coach Bowers’
cousin. The tog was so thick, we could not
see 120 yards off the first tee. The log made
the balls rather hard to follow and the in
flated scores bore out this fact.

After the round and lunch at the house of
the' coach's cousin. the team headed for
their true destination, Galveston, where
we met the rest of the Grinnell golf en-
tourage, Mark and Scott Painter.
(Members of the team not on the trip were
Mike Spurbeck and Craig Junioi Coach
Bowers has brought his golf teams to
Galveston since 1973, and he remarked

“The fewest number of

balls lost by one person
was in the neighorhood

of eight. " '

that this year, the course was in the best
condition he has ever seen. The course prOr
ved to be a challenge for everyone on the
team. It had a large quantity of sand traps,
and water on 16 of the 18 holes. The water
took a heavy toll on the golf ball supply of
all of the team members. The fewest
number of balls lost by one person was in
the neighborhood at eight, and no one on
the team finished a round with the same
ball he’d started with,

By the end of the team's llverday stint in
Galveston, everyone's golf game seemed
to be shaping up nicely, so they traveled to

Baseball: Spring Training

by Lucas Hatlestad

Each spring the Grinnell baseball team
takes a short trip to Ranger, Texas,
located about two hours west of Dallas, in
order to play the team from Ranger Junior
College in a series of exhibition games.
The purpose of the trip is to free our team
from the harsh Iowa winter and allow
them to play out of doors for several days.

nell PEC to practice and wait for the early
April snow to clear. The purpose of the trip
for Ranger team is unclear. By the time
we arrived, they had already played more
than fifteen games against some of the bet
ter junior colleges in the Southwest. Judge
ing by past results of our contests with
them, which remind one more of embar-
rassing football scores than of baseball
outcomes. perhaps our stays have served
as an early-season ego boost for the
Rangers. This year, however, proved to be
a shot of confidence for the good guys,

The team arrived in Ranger in the in
famous minivan, after a two day ride of
eighteen hours, Due to the good fortune of
nearby relatives, I was spared the tedium
of the drive, but I yvas later cursed for
claiming valuable space on the return trip.
We went straight to their dining hall and it
was immediately obvious that our team,
being mostly white, was in the minority.
The vast majority of the students at
Ranger are poor and members of various
minorities, and all are there on an athletic

against the Knights were Rutherford-

Bidding for positions are two other letr

Coach Smith is optimistic, hoping that
additional seasoning and improvement in
a tough dual schedule will equip the
Pioneers to move up in the conference.

sholarship. Most are there to work on their
periormance so they will be offered a
scholarship at a major university. The size
of some of the students was astounding.
Three of our biggest people would fit inside
of their two bigger people. But we soon saw
that there were still some common
denominators between us as college
studenm: they invariably were revolted by
the food.

We went into the game that afternoon cr-
inglng from the expected beating we were
about to be submitted to, but ended up
playing well through five innings, when we
were down 3-1. The ﬂoodgates opened in
the sixth, when they scored eight, thus
employing the dreaded lorrun Slaughter
Rule, but we were pleased to have been in
the game for so long. The most negative
part of the afternoon, and the trip, was the
weather. With the wind at around 25 mph,
clouds and drizzle overhead, and
temperatures in the low forties, we felt
perrectly at home. The conditions improv-
ed little during the rest of the trip.

This was defintely the low point of‘the
outing. We played a JV game in the morn-
ing, losing 10-5, due mainly to poor perfor:
mance in the field. That afternoon they
deployed their big guns for the first time.
We fell in the first game, 9-2, as they beat
us with three impressive home runs. The
last game, our third of the day, lasted only
three innings. but three innings was plenr

detense committed errors in droves,
reminiscent of Rangerfest ’36.

The nightlife in Ranger makes Grinnell
look like Vegas. The town is composed of a
series of gas stations, price-warring truck
stops (burger, fries and drink for $1.79 at
Lillies, $1.59 across the street), small Conr
venience stores, and the college. Their rec
Center, which has pool tables, video games
and CABLE television, is also the
cafeteria. It closes soon after dinner,
which leaves the students time to do

something, which certainly wasn't study-
ing. I saw only a handful of books during
the entire stay. We amused ourselves Mon
day night with a rented VCR and movies,
and on Tuesday and Wednesday with
largescale card games, complete with
modest refreshmens.

A history-making day for Grinnell as —
astonishingly enough — we won the middle
game of the three. Perhaps it was an omen

Brad Sheridan, we broke open a 2-2 tie in

most of us had never seen before, certainly
not against Ranger. It was the first time
Grinnell had ever beaten a Ranger team
after either 11, 13 or 15 trips to Texas (no
one was exactly sure). Although we lost
the final game, it was only by the score of ,
5-1 and we were again using one or their
pitchers.
