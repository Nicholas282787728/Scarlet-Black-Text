The Turkish good-luck Cheer mentioned
above is the team's secret weapon this
year. And, although the cheer has only
“produced” a win in one of the team's three
games so far, Coach Merry Ormsby is up
timistic about the mt of the season. Orm-
sby believes “we’re stronger than last
year,” and hopes to improve not only on
last year's 3-l7-1 record but also as a
cohesive team unit. To accomplish thae
goals, the team “needs to work on our of-
fense," which Ormsby noted has been
"steadily improving throughout practice.”

“Defensive coordination” should be the
team‘s strong point this season, as all but
two or last year’s starting deienders have
returned. Emily Scudder is the new goalie,
while Kathy Cullen replaces Sara
Brichlord as a center-half. Brichford, who

Grinnell lost to Luther, 2-0, in its opener.
“Our transitional passing from links to for-
ward was weak and as a result we only had
about five shots on goal," Ormsby explain
ed, However, the Pioneers came back to
surprise the University or Northern lowa
by a score of H), The lone goal was scored
by left wing l-iolly Larson with about live
minutes left in the lirst half. Ormsby noted
that the team “took advantage oi UNI's
defensive setup” and “passed better" in
the second half, but they were unable to
score again. She also remarked that she
was pleased with Scudder’s performance.
Ormsby called last Wednesday’s encounter
with the University of Iowa an “important"
and “tough" game. She proclaimed before
the game, “ll we play well against lowa,
I'll feel good whemer we win or lose."-

“We didn't play together. We were intitial-

used to having the ball hit that hard.
Perhaps we just needed to be humbled
after beating UNI."

Coach Ed Dombrowski expects his Grins
nell College gridders to “bounce back from
a disappointing effort at Lawrence and give
Carleton a good game." The Pioneers host
Carleton tomorrow in a Midwest Con
ference tilt to be played at Rosenbloonl
Field. Kickoff time for the Parents' Day
contest is 1:30 pm. Admission is free to all
comers.

Grmnell is 1-1 for the year after dropping
a 4&0 contest to Lawrence, the title
favorite, last Saturday, “I doubt if we will-
see a better team than Lawrence the rest of
the season,” Dombrowski stated. “The Vik-
ings are big, strong, quick and deep. We
weren't ready to play, We were mentally
flat." The Pioneers netted only 123 yards
(102 on the ground and 26 through the air!
while Lawrence was collecting 392.
