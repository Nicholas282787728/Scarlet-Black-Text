Last weekend, while we were
partying it up at the only beach
party in tlie corritields, our soce
cer team was kicking around in
the great white nortli. Friday are
ternooii they crushed Gustavus
Adolphus, er, dominating play
for 70 oi the game’s 90 minutes.
Saturday, they took a heating
fromSt. olai, losihg‘l Oinadif»
ririilt game.

The game against Gustavus
Adolphus was highlighted by
Austin sunnionsls goal after an

_ incredible assist by K]. “Nollr
hawk“ Noll. (Take a look at
what is left or his hair it you
are wondering what a Nollhaivk

- is.) Thanks to some excellent
play by Brad “Biaehiirt” Bis-
card, Gustavus Adolphus barely
had a chance to score and took
only two shotson goalie Randy
seely in the entire game. “Their
oiiense was basically long balls,“
Biscard said, a style reminiscent
of numerous sixth~grade recess
games.

Grinnell’s next match was a
physical bout with St. Olar.
St. olar dominated the game,
pounding goalie David Shane.
None the less, shane allowed
only two balls between the pale
white posts. One goal re-
sulted from a St, Olaf break-
away, the other from an or
rant sixryaid pass in front or
our own goal. Commenting on
the game, David Shane said,
“St. Olaf‘s ohense had bet-
ter ball movement,..they were
more aggressive." Also retlecte
ing on the game, striker Austin
Simmons commented that Grin-
nell had at least six chances to
score, but none rell. St. Olaf
Won, zeo.

Coming this weekend will be
an amazing display of athletic
brilliance as Grinnell hosts three

high—caliber teams in the Grin—’

nell Invitational, oiir boys
will play Aurora University at
2 PM. on Friday, and U,
of Wisconsin—Whitewater at 1
P,M.-on Saturday. Whitewater
will be a key game for Grin-
nell, In 1986, Whitewater went
to nationals, and when the 20
teams from our region are clioe
sen to go to Nationals in Cal-
ifomia, a Grinnell victory over
whitewater could be very ini—
pressive. Colorado College, who
have a style oi play very sim—
ilar to Grinnell‘s, will also be
in attendance during this festive
weekend. We will not play Col-
orado, postponing that joy until
October 19.

The Lady Pioneer cross roune
try team opened its 1987 carri-
paign last week by placing sixth
out of nine teams at the Corr
nell Rain Run. Although the
team did not ﬁnish as high as
they had wanted the women
runners posted some good indie
vidual performances. Gzhmell’s
two top runners, Katherine Faire
hanks and Dorothy Shearn,
placed 12th and 15th lespeo
tively to pace the team. The
next two runners ﬁnished in the
27th and 28th spots. Coach
Evelyn Freeman said that the
team tries to run in packs for
team support and unity but
failed to achieve this in the Cor-
nell meet.

Although the team has some
experienced runners, Coach
Freeman stressed that the team
' is still young and inexperienced
and that the season is just un-
derway. She also stated that
there is potential for a strong
team, but the women need to
start ~‘rurinirig together instead

 

of as individuals.“

The Lady Pioneers looked at
this meet as a chance to “get
their feet wet.” since there was
not a lot of emphasis on win-
ning this particular meet, Coach
Freeman used the day as a start-
ing block on which to build.
coach Freeman also stated that
the course at Cornell was only
two miles and that her runners
{are better at 3.1 miles (or 5,000
meters), which is the distance
for the rest oi the team’s meets.

This weekend, the women’s
cross country team travels to
Galesburg, lllinois for the South-
ern Divisional Meet held by
Knox College. Good Luck!

My parents are not here this
weekend. They are visiting my
sister at a Parents’ VVeekeml at
the University or Kansas. There
they are, participating in trarlir
tional Parents’ weekend activi-
ties: tailgating before and then
watching the big rootball game,
Thebig football game is al»
sent train the Grinnell Parents'
Weekend. The college‘s schedule
makers have banished our team
to Milwaukee to play Concordia.
obviously, the college believes
that football players, by nature,
are orphans. Thus, the cola
lege has solie iled other sports
related activ es, like the Fun
Run and the big soccer game, to
ﬁll this vacuum.

The Rm Run is 3 Parents’
Weekend institution clearly in
niienced by Geolge Drake, be
cause he is the only parent who
can complete the “in Run witlir
out a cardiac arrest. My father
considers the words “fun” and
“run" to be mutually exclusive
A fun run for him would be to
rim up a ﬂight of stairs, ﬁx a
bowl oi ice cream, change the
channels on the TV, and then
fall asleep on the couch. A fun
run for my mother would be to
run into town and to buy as
many sale items as possible with
only a charge card in her hand.
