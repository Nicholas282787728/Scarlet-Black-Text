SGA should improve

representation of

student opinion

During the final meeting of last year’s Student Government
Association (SGA), Joint Board finally took a stand on an issue which
had been a serious concern of Grinnell students for the past two years.

The South African Support Group asked SGA to decrde in favor of
restricting the Board of Trustees from investing SGA monies in com-
panies which did business in South Africa. SGA voted in favor of the
proposal by a margin of one, But, whatever the decision, SGA should
not have waited two years to consider an issue with which Grin-
nellians were so involved.

As an elected body, Joint Board has an obligation to keep abreast of
student opinion and current issues. SGA is the student body’s
representative to the faculty, administration and the world outside of
Grinnell and ought to present organized statements which reﬂect stu-
dent opinion. It should, a least, consider more student views, whether
elected officials agree with the views or not.

SGA should initiate study of issues without waiting for a campus
group to ask the government to form an opinion. The SASG had been
active for two years before SGA finally paid attention to the concern
students were voicing for divestment, Not every small organization
on campus will merit SGA action, but the SASG had stirred not only
the student body but the faculty, administration and the Board of
Trustees. SGA ought to have moved itself to a stance on the issue

‘ without having to be directly asked. '

In the coming year our newly elected SGA might take the initiative
to consider such issues as core curriculum or nuclear arms prolifera»
tion, These are only two controversies on which large numbers of
Grinnell students hold strong opinions.

The decisions on such matters do not have to involve any immediate
action, per se. SGA could fulfill its role by recognizing and developing
an opinion on the issues. A governing body can have impact simply by
making its views public. For instance, a student government in an
Iowa high school last spring voted against nuclear arms proliferation.
Practically, they could do nothing but make their stand public, yet
that helps spur other people to consider the problem.

Students appreciate the services SGA provides, such as book sales
and airport shuttles. And SGA officials work hard to supervise
various campus budgets and organizations. However, the major job
of the student government is to represent the students, Hopefully, this
year‘s SGA will recognize this function and pay more attention to stu-
dent demonstrations of, opinion.
