A folk tradition carried on in Grinnell

by Dawd Hudson and Jeanne Zimmer

, ;The form oi music which is now
known as Sacred Harp had its origin in
the church and folk music of England.
It came to America with the pilgrims
{vho were seeking religious freedom.
Except for their church service, these
pioneer settlers had no recreation,
therefore they would congregate at Hie
home of a neighbor or in church and
sing the songs they had sung in
England.

a This iorm oi music eventually moved
south alter the influx of more technical
European traditions. The introduction
of the organ and the increased use of a
choir in church, instead oi all congregae
tional singing, led to the opinion that
sacred Harp singing was a crude‘ form
of music.

. Sacred Harp music found a home in
the Southern Uplands of the United
states, where people were relatively
untouched by the European inﬂuences
that had reached the Northeast. These
rural folk had a healthy appetite for the
music and developed the social joy oi
singing. The tradition flourishes today
in the rural south and Sacred Harp cans
ventions are held frequently,

».The ancestors of Benjamin Franklin
white were among the early New
England settlers, and they developed
an interest in, and a love tor, sacred
music. The family drifted southward to
South Carolina where BF. was born.
The Original sacred Harp book oi songs
was published by White in 1344. it is, ac-
cording to its title, “The Best Collection

of Sacred Songs, Hymns, Odes, and An
thems Ever 0iicred the singing Public
for General Use." The book is a com-
pendium or 573 iolk hymns «including
iolk tunes, psalm tunes, and revivalist
hymns), and has been the bible of the
southern rural singing-school move
ment since 1340.

The key to singing the music at the
Sacred Harp is to be found in its shape
note system oi notation. Practical exs
perimentation had proved that s1ght~
reading was iacilitated by varying the

Sacred Harp singing came to Lil‘mnell
about eight years ago when the
Celestial Sacred Harp Singers were
started by a student as a senior music
project; the group has been student-
directed ever since. The purpose of the

Rock with the Jack Bruce Band

by PeterZagorcs

Word has been passed around that the
Jack Bruce Band will be playing here
on Wednesday, Nov. 26, at 8:30 pm. in
Roberts Theater. Yet it seems as
though only the hard core rock fans are
aware oi the special treat that is in
store.

It you are unaware who Jack Bruce
is, then I shall inform you, even at the
risk of having all the seats sold out
beiore i get to the Forum desk.

Bruce was one of the most famous
rock musicians oi the '605. As a bass
player. he was second only to the
Beatle's Paul McCartney in popularity.
Bruce. along with Ginger Baker and
Eric Clapton, farmed Cream. the first
hand to combine the elements full;
throttled, murderous rock with
popularity on a mass basis. The impact
that Cream's success had on music still
prevails heavily.

Cream's live periormances are
legendary. it was not unusual ior any
single member or the power trio to take
oft on wild solos ior prolonged periods,
At one concert in Madison Square
Garden, Bruce, and Clapton (on guitar)
waged a war or devastating solos dur-
ing a version of Willie Dixon’s “Spoons

12

ful” which lasted over 16 minutes. A
Cream concert could be accurately
described as tidal waves of sound and
human electricity swirling around the
hall wherever they were playing.

As a bassist, Bruce was singularily
awesome. The sounds he produced

from his bass and harmonica were
revolutionary. No one texcept possibly
Clapton) could match the ferocmus
onslaught of his solos. HIS full throated
vocals were captiviating, Along with
Clapton, Baker, and Peter Brown, «a
close friend to John Lennon and George
Harrison), Bruce composed/arranged
numerous hit records. Some of his most
famous include "l'm So Glad, "Sun-
shine of Your Love," "White Room,"
and "Crossroads " There 01' their
albums, Fresh L' uni. Disraeli Gears.
and Wheels 0! Fire sold well into the
millions.

When Bruce slings his lour-stringer
into town, one can expect to hear some
oi his characteristic heavy-handed,
driving, "misbehaving" blues. During
his days as a Britlsth Bluesman, he's
played with them all; so ii you‘re any
type oi music-lover. you should enjoy
him. ,

Tickets for the Jack Bruce Band will
be distributed at the Forum Desk,
beginning Monday. Nov. 24, at 12 pm.
Again, the show begins at .30 p.m, in
Roberts Theater on Nov, 2b. thi your
mark, get set, go!

Scarlet and Block,
