George Drake’s estimates, Grinncll
will construct a new ans building

rooms. music practice rooms, and a

class C felony.

Bulbulian said the fight began
inside the Bar, when insulting words
were exchanged. “Instead of being
sman and walking away. I turned
around and said something back,"
Balbulian said, It was these words
that sparked the first pushing and
shoving just outside the front on-
ttance to the Bar on Main Street.

Bulbulian said he removed his
jacket and invited one of the high-
school students, Dennis Moore, to
“settle things.” Bulbulian said he
fought with Moore and several of
Moore‘s friends for a few minutes,
and then headed off toward Super
America on West St.

Bulbulian said he realized he had
left his jacket at theBarand when he
returned to reclaim it, he ran into
Whipple, Gingerich. Shook and
Hess. As the five of them headed
down thealley oifofFifth Ave., they
spied Moore and his friends in an
empty lot on the comer. Fighting

ten men.

serby, drew a pocketknifc and ap-

Judicial Council onSunday unani-
mously found Mike Kent not guilty
of harassment charges stemming
from his controversial posters for
the group Students Against Hippies.

After almost two and a half hours
of questions and testimonyinaclosed
hearing Sunday night, the members
of Judicial Council discussed the
casein secrecy for 25 minutes before
determining that Kent‘s poster.
whichdepictsa group of demonstra-
tors being blown up by a cartoon
dog, did not violate college regula-
tions which prohibit “assault. har-
assment or threats of harm to person
or property."

Dan Werner, who with Doug Hess
ﬁled the case against Kent, said in a
written statement thatheisconsider-
ing appealing the case to-the

Spelman Pres. Chosen
Graduation Speaker

lohnctta Cole, president of
Spelman College, has been se-
lected as the speaker for this
year’s commencement exer-
cises.

Cole, the ﬁrst black woman
president of Spelman, was called
a ”dynamic speaker” by Dave
Jones, chairman of the senior
week committee.

“We were vcry much con-
cerned about getting someone
who we felt would give a very
goodspeech,"hesaid,“aspeaker
who would make people think
and provide a memorable expe»
rience to people that attend,“

Before becoming Spelman
president in 1987, Cole was a
professor of anthropology at
HunterColIegeandamemberof
graduate faculty at the City
University of New York. She
was proceeded at Spelman by
Grinnell trustee DonaldStewart,
class of ’59, who iscurrently the
president of the College Board.

Bill Deminoff, coordinator of
commencement, said he is “de
lighted" to have Cole speak. She
is “really a force and an impor-
tant voice in American higher
education today," he said,

“The thing people have to
keep in mind is that we did not
have the budget that could af-
ford a celebrity,“ he said, “Our
concern was to get a good .
speaker with a thought-provok-
ing message, not necessarily
someone who would get us on
the evening news for being
here,“ Jones said.

mencement speaker with the
