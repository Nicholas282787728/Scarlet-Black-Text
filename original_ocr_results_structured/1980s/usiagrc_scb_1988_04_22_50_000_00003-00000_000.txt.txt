Financial Aid Decisions
Provoke Student Criticism

by Jessica Weisel

“We give more than most institu-
tions oi our type," claims Presir
dent George Drake regarding stu-
dent financial aid About 65 per-
cent of Grinnell students are on
some type oi aid, whether it is col-
lege grants, merit scholarships, or
Iederal funds. For some students
coping with the higher tuition, it
might not be enough.

Senior Kiri Ne mtvedt was nearly
forced to transfer alter her junior
year, when the college attempted
to cancel all of her aid that was
provided by the college as well as
half of a National Merit Scholar-
ship She and her parents were
unable to reach James Lincoln,
director of the Office of Financial
Aid. After telling the school She
could not stay, she received an
award ”when we talked to them,
the amountwentup. sheexplains,
but the [inal amount she received
in July was still less than her
previous awards,

Lincoln. citing past experiences
with the Scarlet and Black, refused
to be quoted in this article

Sophomore Bruce Kroeze's aid
problems occurred when a capital
gain was added twice to his
parents' income. Kroeze was told
that he would receive no aid for the
1987-88 years. “My iamily had to
write letter after letter. and Called
every other day," he says. “We
never got to speak to lthe
directorl, always a secretary in
charge."

The financialraid office claims
that the opportunity for students to
appeal awards decisions makes
Grinnell different from other col-
leges, The college looks at special
circumstances. But both Koreze
and Namtvedt ieel their appeals
were delayed, possibly intentional-
ly.

Drake states that Grinnell “uses
a standard formula which is "a,
tiunwide. We then make ap-
propriate adjustments.” Further-
more, Drake contends that (man
cial aid is the most rapidly growing
part at the budget, having more
than doubled in his nine years
here. Grinnell also awards more
grants than loans than most other
colleges so as to “not saddle
students with debts," Drake says,

One of the difficulties with iinan»
cial aid is that, in the past, Grinnell
has attempted to entice students
with aid packages. With a larger
applicant pool, this is no longer
necessary. Drake explains,
“We've tried to outbid other ins
stitutions. tNow) aid is less of a
means to induce students to
come." The cut in enticement aid
is not supposed to aiiect students
already at Grinnell. Kroeze and
Namtvedt disagree. “The deciding
iactor in my coming to Grinnell
was the 31000 more that they gave
me," claims Krueze, “We were
told by Jim Tederman that our aid
would never go down iiour income
didn't change very much." Namtr

vedt also states, “1 got a really
generous amount my ireshman
year, but it's gone down ever
since.”

Drake explains, “The balancing
oi aid and the cost or college pro
grams will allow us to pay iaculty
more.” He believes that students
may ieel a “squeeze,” but will still
be able to attend Grinnell. Aid will
go up in proportion to the cost oi
tuition, but will not be given in ex
cess oi need. in tact, with the tuir
tion increase, students who may
have not received aid before will
be able to tor the 1988-89 year,

Need is one of the greatest dif-
ficulties in deciding aid, Often, the
amount or an award will change
between years because a student‘s
parents have a change in income.
Uniamiliarity with parental in
come causes many student com-
plaints, according to the otiice oi
Student Financial Aid. This claim,
though, does not hold up in all
cases. "i know exactly what my
parents make," says Kroeze.
Namtvedt agrees, ‘I know what my
parents make better than the
school,”

Since Namtvedt will graduate in
May. she no longer has to be con
cerned about aid. Kroeze, though,
has decided not to bother with the
department again. “Part or the
reason I'm transferring is that 1
don’t feel like battling for aid,” he
said

Way Back When

by Susan Roth

so Years Ago
April is, 1939

Harry Hopkins, then United
States secretary oi commerce, was
appointed to the Grinneli College
board oi trustees, filling in a
vacancy. it was hoped also that
Hopkins “would consent to be a
guest lecturer at Grinnell, much as
President Roosevelt is at
Harvard,”

A group oi students sent a Sub
survey in Chicago brought back
these results: 1. Businessmen looks
ed ior college graduates with agr
gressive personalities, were in
good health, were prepared to
work hard, and were willing to
start at the bottom with a small
salary. 2. Grades and scholastic
standing were considered “a good
index of industry” and extracurr
ricular activities developed
“qualities of leadership.” 3. The
employers‘ chiet complaint
against college graduates was that
they were too “choosy" about their
employment and oiten had “an ex
aggerated opinion oi their worth to
busmess as beginners."
