Last year's misfits and miscreants
have become this week's “hot" ball
club. That's right. Burning Rectal Itch
ll has found reliet and they spell it
Preparation w. In a previous column.
this reporter stated that this team is not
really very good. Even though they lost
to <1 and 4 Fun last week. We“. l have to
eat my words. These guys are really
pretty good. Anchored by Jack “The
Hack" Hartung in the middle. these
soccer players have been able to play a
ball control offense which seems to
mystily other teams. They also leature
the amazing Chip Maxson who is known
(or his ability to hit 50 percent of his
shots irom beyond the threepoint line
Except tor the occasional kicked ball.
BRI 11 has overcome its early season
problems and has climbed to fourth
place in the Scott rankings this week.
So. we'll be waiting to see What the Itch
does as it bounces along the rest oi that
long road to Darby.

1t LSD — The Denver Nuggets ot the
Special Interest-league had to settle
down and play detense against the
prekusly undeteated MUG. This was
the game which decided the lirst place
berth tor the upcoming l-inal Eight
playolls in Darby its been rumored
that members of the team have Seen V|7
sions of Winning it all while periorming
the Liquid Snake Dancer but that is yet
to be seen.

2) MUG 7 The bubble of the
undefeated season was popped Wednes
day night by the strong LSD team. oh.
well. Nobody's perfect and MUG
doesn't have John Wooden so with only
one loss MUG is still in good position to
steal the first place trophy in Darby.
They might just have to come the night
before to “receive" it.

at Venetian Blinds 7 Solid. Strong.
Silent. BOOOOOOOOOURRRIIHNNN-
NGGGGGGG. Will these guys ever lind
a star on then‘ roster, Maybe, But not
this week.

4! BRI ll 7 They've done it. They've
really done it. That's right folks the Itch
has really been buring up the FBI}
courts that to mention the bathrooms}
with 3 straight wins. on my, I hope
these boys don't forget their roots and

all the people back home who supported
them while they wallowed at the bottom
of the bowl Wouldn t Greg Donovan he
proudIWouldn t Greg Donovan be pro-
ud? Congratulations Bill

at Pink Flamingos 7 I guess Uncle
Dave came through with the Gerbei-s,
Pediatrician Dr. Spock has said thatthe
boys should be ready (or solid food in a
week. Let‘s hope it's in time for the
Final Eight tournament,

at PMS — Hey guys. \vhere've you
been? Attendance again seems to be a
problem lor the Pretty Messy Shooters.
I think that the team should consider
giving detention lor those had little
boys who are playing hookie.

7) The Larry “Bud" Melman Fan
Club 7 The Larry “Bud's" have slip-
ped a little but the new shipment of
ToastronraStlck should cheer up the
Fan Club, Hopelully, Mr. Larry will
give up the inane character or Ken the
Gardner and concentrate his efforts on
getting his team back on track.

8) The Fun Bunch — They had fun this
week.

at AAA 7 Apparently the detox pro»
gram didn t work This calls [or drastic
measures. Hello Betty Ford Clinic Do
