On March 18, the Personnel Appeals
Board presented a lZ-page document to
Assistant Professor of Philosophy Dan
Magurshak and president George Drake.
It commented on the procedures which
took place throughout Magurshak's recent
tenure process, In the document. the board
cited problems regarding the way the deci-
sion was handled. The Hu‘ee members of
the six-member board who reviewed the
decision are Associate Professor of Educa-
tion Roberta Atwell, Professer of
Mathematics Charles Jensen and Rosenr
field Professor Joseph Wall r

The major issue was Magurshak's job
description. The Appeals Board has
established that in the considerations oi
the Executive Council regarding his
tenure, a good deal of discussion occurred
regarding the description of the position he
holds here, Magurshak's position is
described as a specialization in existed
tialism and phenomenology. as well as
19th-century philosophy. it was introduced
into the discussion that this is a fringe area

of philosophy which ought not to be
covered at a small liberal arts college such
as Grinnell

Magurshak said, “I know for a fact —
one tenured professor told me 7 that one
council member he voted against me
because of that consideration. He was con
vinced by the discussion that the position
should not be here ”

The report brings forth evidence from
the American Association ol Univeristy
Professors (AAUPV which published Cer»
tain rules for tunure. "Even according to
the American legal system, you don't do it
this way7 you can't redefine a job at uiis
level, at this time," said Magurshak

Drake told Magurshak that he had
serious doubts about his teaching ability at
the upper level, but Magurshak was never
able to satisfactorally determine Drake's
source of evidence for that charge. “Ap-
parently he had discussion with students
and colleagues," Magurshak said, “not
meaning my department colleagues,
meaning colleagues in the sense or other
members of the Grinnell faculty." The
number of students and faculty members
Drake spoke to is not known

"In other words," Maguishak cons
tinued, "there doesn't seem to be any good
evidence for these doubts about my
teaching ability at the upper level In light
of the job description discussion, one could
interpret that [council member'sl come

ment as meaning not being sure that the ,

courses 1 taught should be taught here, as
oppossed to actually having trouble
teaching those courses,

There are set methods of considering job
descriptions at Grinnell. The department
gets together and the members decide
what they need. After discussion they pre-
sent a proposal to the EPC. EPC suggesr
tions are considered, men the students and
faculty agree on a description. The EXV
cecutive Council votes on it, if they ap-
prove it they then recommend that it be a
description for the department and the ad-
ministration either accepts it or rejects it.

When Magurshak was hired, he came in

to a job that had been established three or
four years before his arrival. it was cone
sidered a legitimate job with a specializa-
tion in 19th and 20th~century continental
philosophy. Since he has been on are cam-
pus, there has never been any question of
the legitimacy of that job in the philosophy
department of a liberal arts college.

“And if there were, " said Magurshak.
"it should have been raised with the
department, with the EPC, and we should
have talked about it and decided whether
we wanted to keep Hie position or not. That
was never done. All of a sudden, it was
raised at the council level of my tenure
decision. It was brought in. effectively, as
an argument against my tenure. And on
that basis. the Personnel Appeals Board
says the decision should he scrapped. They
[Members] recommend that the decision
be overturned and that it should be fed
back to the coun ' it should start over
next year." " '

The recommendation has been
presented to Drake. He must now decide
whether or not he wants to start again next
year or whether he simply wants to make
his own decision this year, The final desir
cion is expected to come from Drake
within the next week or two.

“I am absolutely mystified by
whatever's going on right now," Magur—
shak said, ”I cannot figure it out, I don‘t
know what's going to happen. 1 don't know
on what basis it will happen."

“It's the same old story, a great lack of
communication to say theleast; dials put-
ting it very mildly. i don't know who
thought that he or she could do this but it's
just not the way we do things at Grinnell."

He added, “During the course of this in-
vestigation by the Personnel Appeals
Board, 1 understand that [Dean of Faculr
tyl Catherine Frazer said she had in mind
the remaking oi the philosophy depart
ment for some time But she's never told
us what she has in mind. iget the impres-
sion that she's going to try to reshape the
department as something more in line with
the traditional Anglo-American depart

ment of philosophy that emphasized the
kinds of courses one takes later on at
graduate schools. But that's purely
speculation, I don't know what she has in
mind. All I know is that she thinks my
specialty doesn't belong."

I

At present, Magurshak is not quite clear
as to what the near future is going to bring
him. He applied for a research grant irom
a German foundation called the Alexander
Von Hombolt Foundation and heard on the
first day of spring break that he has been
awarded the grant. Thus, he will be leave
ing this August to spend one year in Ger-
many

“if in fact they bring me up [for tenure
consideration] again." said Magurshak,
“well, we'll just have to see. I really don't
believe that's going to happen. . . lbelieve
rm going to be fired again, i really do.
Assuming that I'm still fired and l can't
rind a job in Germany. which is very dill
iicult to do, 1 will be here the following
year for my last year, and will look for
work the yearaiter that, IfI'm tired again.
id like to be out of here as soon as possi-
ble. because it's dead time.”

Regarding the need to find a job
elsewhere, Magurshak is hopeful. “Con-
trary to some opinions.” he said, “I am a
good teacher, I'm just hoping that 1 can
land one of those few positions out there. I
mean, people do die; people do quit the
field; there are those few positons. It was
very diiiicult to get the posiuon l have
here. No, I‘m worried; I’m very worried,
In some ways. the six years‘ experience
and the couple of articles make me a good
product. But in other ways. for example, if
I were trying to get a job at Grinnell Cole
lege they'd say, "no, get us one fresh out of
grad school so we can pay him a lot less,’
So, in some ways that might help me with
some schools, but in other schools, it‘ll Just
rule me out.

jbesides, being denied tenure is always
a kind oi stigma . . . the burden of deiense
is on me. You know, ‘why were you fired'Z'
is always the question they ask. ‘If he is so
good. why didn't the keep him"' ,,

Faculty members elect Dennis Haas chairman

Tenure ’and curriculum review expected to be major issues

by Anne Rawland

with 101 faculty members voting,
chap.ain oi the the college and Professor of
Religious Studies Dennis Haas recently
became the new Chairman of the Faculty.
Haas deicated Biology Professor Kenneth
Christiansen for the two-year term which
begins next fall

The vote totals for each candidate.
however, are unknown, “The Vote is never
revealed." said Professor History Don
Smiui, Smith chairs the Faculty Organizer
tion Committee which is charged with
holding the election, "I don't think the
faculty has ever wanted to know the
totals,” he said,"‘People are more in-
terested in having a chairman than knows
ing how decisive it was."

When electing a new taculty chair, each
faculty member submits a nomination,
Faculty members with the most nomina»
tions are then posted. A second ballot is
taken to determine two candidates Final
ballots are submitted over a twrrweek
period to members of the Faculty
Organization Committee who count the
votes and announce the winner.

When asked about his defeat Chris-
tiansen said. “I’m not exactly unhappy
about it; it's a lot of work." He supported
Haas fully, ”I think he [Haas] will do a
fine job, probably better than 1 would."

Haas said he decidedto run after he had

“thought about .it tor a while." He also
noted several faculty colleagues encourag»
ed him to seek the position. His experience
includes serving on the Executive Council

tor the past two years, The Executive.

Council holds numerous responsibilities ins
eluding iaculty promotion and tenure
revtew

Haas said the two critical issues he an-
ticipates during his term are tenure and
curriculum review, Regarding tenure
Haas said. “The thing I'm most concerned
about is that these decisions be made Cons
sistently," He deﬁlined to comment on the
case of Assistant Professor Dan Magur»
shak, because the case is still under ap-
peal He stated the present problem with
tenure decisions is a lack of communica
tion.

“Lines oi communication are pretty
good but when lines aren't good then the
college works toward opening new lines,"
said Haas. “The iaculty is going to address
tenure with the administration after the
Magarshak case is over."

On curriculum Haas promised to “sup
port the study and exploration of
matters." Haas revealed that he personal-
ly has some reservations about changing
the curriculum. “I see my role as ‘okay
let’s talk about it,’ ” He said, Haas sup-

ported hearing the student opinion on cur-
riculum revisions. “The whole faculty and
administration should hear that "

As for more student involvement, Haas
advocated encouraging stronger student
participation on existing committees as
well as holding special sessions for mass
participation

As faculty head, Haas will represent the
faculty View on the Executive CounCil. He
will also work with Dean of the Faculty
Catherine Frazer, who also sits on the
council “1 see no reason from past ex»
periences that we shouldn't be able to work
well together," he said about Frazer, “I'm
really open to the best“

Frazer‘ concurred with Haas' assess»
merit. “He's a experienced council
member," she said. “He and I don't
always agree on everything but I guess no
two people do, I think it's useful to have
differences ”

Outgoing faculty chair. Professor of
French Morris Parslow said, ”I think the
big issue is and will be the problem or
tenure. What I did was mostly call atten-
tion to the problem." According to
Parslow, “The faculty Chair is asked to do
a lot of errands ihope Mr. Haas hasa sues
cesstul tenure and I think we should sup
port him."
