Mud pit stirs up more Relays discord

To the Editor’

Wednesday night we attended a
special meeting of the Grinnell Relays
Committee concerning the mud pit.
This meeting was held to explain to us
the reasons oi the committee for doing
.way with the mud pit. Wes Kennedy,
chairman of me committee, stated four
justifications for its actions. The first
was that the mud pit added nothing to
the spirit in which the Grinnell Relays
was originally intended, Second, the
mud pit deterred people irom attending
the Relays for fear of being thrown in,
Third. the mud pit was a distraction
and caused reduced participation in
other events. Fourth, the committee
perceived the majority oi the campus
did not want a mud pit and acted accor-
dingly,

The four reasons listed above are

. those oi a small group of people ex-
pressing their own opinions without
consulting the college community. The
fair way, the way that was rejected by
the committee, would have been to cons

duct a poll to determine the opinion oi
the campus. The committee rejected
the proposal, stating that its decision
was final and further discussion would
not change the decision Furthermore,
threats to arrest students ior defacing
college property. i e digging a mud pit.
are taking matters too far.

The mud pit has been a tradition of
the Relays for many years and doing
away with it would be no different man
doing away with the Beer, Bacon.
Beaver Breakfast which some people
do not attend because they find it as of-
fensive as others find the mud pit. ‘
Respectfully yours. Evan Feldman.

To the Editor- .
Some last minute objections have
been raised about the Grinnell Relays
Committe's decision to drop the vmud
pit as one oi the day's events. After a

couple of Relays, a Nortthoudi tugoiL
war was instituted. Shortly thereaiter‘,
a mud pit was added, in recent
years, the tugot-war disappeared,
leaving only the vestige of the mud,
pit. Clearly, the mud pit has not
been and is not central to the Relays. '
Through much discussion, we came
to the conclusion that the real spirit of. _
the Relays, satire and carefree tun, -
would best be Served without the .
distraction oi a constantly populated pit , ;
of humiliation. Coercion in any form is
reprehensible and the common trend of
the mud pit has been to coerce, by
physical force, those who want to enjoy
the weekend without wallowing in mud.
Nothing could be more in the spirit oi
Grinnell than the freedom to enjoy the'
weekend without the threat of being
forced. against your will, into a mud
pit. Therefore, we have decided the
will be no mud pit in this year

Scuff/ing continues ~ over scarce practice space

o the Editor:
Grinnell College has limited and ms
adequate practice space ior musicians.

There are 179 students taking private
lessons and 49 oi these are piano
students who absolutely have to use the
practice rooms, or which there are only
9. including two classrooms. Because
space is so limited students need to
make a $10 deposit at the beginning oi
each semester to reserve rooms for
themselves. Even then they are allowed
no more than it] hours of reserved time
per week,

This semester a small percentage oi
private music students have reserved
time and the rooms are scheduled
almost constantly The people who did
not reserve space have to work
themselves into the lew empty times or
hope that a scheduled person doesn't
show up ior his time slot. But paid
music students are not the only people
vying for time in the practice rooms

The rock land jazz, etc i bands on
campus also need a place to rehearse
and the two Fine Arts classrooms,
FAIM and FAIDG, are ideal places for
the bands to play. Ideal for them. that
is. The bands have been restricted by
the music department to practice in
these rooms only on Friday, Saturday
and Sunday nights. The reason for this
restriction is that the bands rehearse so
loudly that people playing in the prac-
tice rooms between FAlOG and FAIOG
cannot hear themselves, These rooms
are isr from soundproof and there is
enough noise from within the practice
area whcr several people. are playing

April 24, W8)

without adding the loud strains of a
band to the volume,

A few bands have found other places
to rehearse such as the extra KDIC
studio in Darby but there are too many
bands trying to find space and there
simply isn't enough on campus. Some
groups have begun to use the Fine Arts
rooms on nights other than the weekend
but the private students complain and
the bands are often thrown out after
confrontations with the other students.
Fine Arts office personnel or music
faculty,

i appreciate that bands have a right
to exist and should be able to practice
when they need to but they are too loud
and the students who are paying ior
lessons are entitled to quiet practice
rooms

A related problem is that the bands
tend to practice with their volume turn-
ed up so high that they can be heard all
over the Fine Arts Building as well as
the surrounding area, There have even
been times when rehearsing bands
have interfered with concerts in prnc
gress in Herrick Chapel It seems un»
necessary to play at iull volume when
only practicing in relatively small
rooms Not all bands have been
Cooperative, either, when asked by
other students to tone down.

i would like to see more practice
rooms built and a couple of separate
rooms provided ior bands where they
could practice as much as they like.
However. that is not going to happen. at
least not tor a long time so until then

bands should practice in the Fine Arts '
Building only during their specified *
times and when they are asked to turn
down their volume they should do so. 7

Students disrupt
conference

To the Editor: .

Last Monday evening during the -.
Writers' Conference in South Lounge. ,
about 15 students left in the middle of
the first reading This rude behavior
disturbs all those who came to hear the
readings but even more disturbing is .-
the effect it has on our guests. It
disrupted their presentations and leit,
an impression of discourtesy which no
apology can eiiace. The Writers' Con~
ierence is a major college event but this
unmannerly behavior often occurs at
public presentations. We cannot con-
tinue to invite prestigious speakers to
campus to have them treated this way.
Grinnell will earn a reputation as a
place where guest speakers are treated
shaobily and we the undersigned _
deplore this behavior and ask that all
who attend public performances act
with maturity and courtesy 7 Donald
