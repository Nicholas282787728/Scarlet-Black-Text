Why are you the best candidate for SGA vice-president?

Jefff Fields

I think it's a Combination of
having a purpose: wanting to
basically serve students. It
sounds kind of corny, but
wanting to make sure our
curriculum stays the same. And
also. whereas last year I was
running on a lot of unrelated
experience, which I still believe
has helped me, I’ve gotten a lot
of pertinent experience right now,
and basically, I am the most
experienced candidate, as far as
I'm concerned, and I want to do
tllejob.

Matt Moreland
Being here for three years,
I've become involved with many
different students from different
groups and different interests.
And then, working as an SA,
people are always voicing to me
their opinions and views about
things. concerns on campus
about what‘s happening. I really
like Grinnell College and l think
this is a good time and a good
- place for me to come forward and
express what other people have
been saying to me for three years,
two years especially, working as
student adviser. I feel a lot of
times more recently SGA hasn’t
been very representative of
students. It seems like the
student involvement in SGA
consists of a few people showing
up for a study break and voting

for dorm senators, Election
turnouts are never that great. 1
would like to see a good election
turnout here and get more people
involved. I think I can bring that
in because of this wide variety of
people that I know. And I feel
I’m a very approachable person to
talk with and get a lot of different
opinions and then I can put these
together and be able to express it,
whether it be to the SGA in
general or in working with the
administration and faculty.

Alanna Tyler

I haven't thought of it in
terms of why I'm the best
candidate, but rather in terms of
what makes me especially
qualified to do the job, which is,
I guess, the same thing. First of
all, I’m just your average Joe
Student and in that respect I think
that I think about things in the
way that the avaerage student
would. What I mean by that is'
that a lot of students have
experience, and sometimes that
experience takes them into a
different vein. so that it’s not
easy for them to relate to all the
students. I don‘t think that I
have that problem. I’m able to
work very well with different
kinds of people and I think that's
very important for this job,
because the faculty is very diverse
and so is the student body. Ad-
ditionally, I am very persistent

and I think that you have to be
persistent in order to inﬂuence
the faculty on issues of
curriculum because they have so
much say on curriculum. You
need a person who is going to
continually advocate what the
students want. Because I am
persistent and because I am able
to relate to a diverse group of
students I think that that makes
me especially qualified for the
job. My ability to relate to all
kinds of people comes as a result
of my on-carnpus and offrcampus
experience. My onrcampus
experience includes being a
student adviser. In that role I‘ve
come into contact with a lot of
people and had to deal with some
very difficult people, and that I
think has helped a lot with my
interpersonal skills. My offr
campus experiences have taken
me into groups where I never
dreamed that I would go, with
very different people, people who
are different from me in terms of
their age, ethnic background,
geographical background. I just
have a real respect for hearing
different people’s perspectives and
I think that's important. I don’t
know that that is something
everybody can do and I think that
I can do that really well. I would
say that because I'm a respectcr
of persons, and that‘s very
important for this job, that
makes me especially qualified.

What will be your most important Cabinet appointment?

Jefff Fields

Well, seeing as the treasurer
and SludcnliI believe it‘s the
student coordinator, are pretty
much set for next year, I would
have to say the parliamentarian.
It‘s kind of tough to say-what the
most important position would
be. because there’s no rank. and
everyone does differentjobs. But
I would say the parliamentarian,
just because he or she will be the
control. the person who would
control the and the president, and
make sure. I would rely on that
person to make sure that we‘re
doing what we say we’re going to
do. And also as the strong arm,
if I can use that word, that
phrase, the strong arm in the
SGA, the Joint Board meetings,
that’s the law.

Matt Moreland

Ircally don‘t know. It won’t
be my own decision, it will be
along with the president, so I
don’t have any feelings about
what will be the most important.
Anything dealing with the
IudCo, probably. I’m not sure if
we even put any new members
on there. how often those people
change. But I think in that
aspect, because that’s kind of a
touchy situation.

Alanna Tyler

I think the most important
Cabinet appointment would
probably be my student
coordinator because for a lot of
the things I want to do in terms
of student involvement, student
awareness, and student education,
I would probably need to work
closely with that person. I know
that they have the regular student
coordinator duties, but I foresee
that there are some educational

things that I would want to work
with them on. The student
coordinator should be the person
who’s in touch with the campus
and what the students want or
what they want out of the
activities that the student
coordinator is responsible for.

They are responsible for how
those activities proceed so it‘s
very important that that person
be open to hearing what students
have to say and making sure that
it is as inclusive of all the
students as possible.

What abilities do you have that you're

especially proud of?

Jeffl' Fields

Well, I can work with people.
I can’t say that I hit it off well
with everybody, but when I have
to work with someone, I can,
I've learned how to work with
people, and that‘s one of the
important things, I think, about
being vice-president, is that I’m
going to have to work with peo-
ple, people being students.
faculty, administrators. I’m
going to have to work with them
all. I’m going have to work with
people probably off campus at
some point, just to correspond
with people. So I guess one of
my greatest skills that I would
bring to the office is that I am a
worker, I know how to work, and
I want to work. and that in itself
will allow me to achieve litany of
my goals,

Malt Moreland

Being approachable with
other people. being a good
listener, and being a diverse
enough person myself that I can
share interests with so many
other people. I really like di-
versity. That's why I like
Grinnell College. How I go

about my‘communication, I‘in.

‘l": .

proud of that. my ability to go
out and talk with different people,
meet with people, new people,
not just the friends thatI have or
people that I know, but meeting
new people. \

Alanna Tyler

This is going to sound really
strange, but for lack of better
phrasing, what I'm really proud
of ts my ability to think multir
porspectively. By that what I
mean is that when I go to the
decision table and in rep-
resenting a group, I don't think,
“Now, how is this going to affect
Alanna Tyler, black woman?" I
think, “How is this going to
affect Alanna Tyler, black
woman, and also how is it going
to affect my peers who may not
be black, who may not be
women, or who may not be from
the United States?” That, to me,
is very important when you‘re
representing a large body of
people and that's something that
I learned mostly though my off-
campus experiences. That is the
thing that I’m most proud ofv
that I can think multiv
perspectively. .

How much experience do you have in
dealing with faculty and administration?

Jefff Fields

Well, as a student, I have
dealt with faculty members I've
had [as] teachers, so I’ve dealt
with them on that basis. I’ve
been a student adviser and a hall
activities coordinator, so I’ve
been dealing with people in
Student Affairs a lot. I'm on my
Student Educational Policy
Committee, my EPC. and I deal
with the faculty members in my
major. I‘m on the Curriculum
Committee, which is a faculty
and student committee, which
calls for me to deal with faculty
members. I can't say that I've
gone out of my way outside of
committee work to deal with fac»
ulty members, to talk to faculty
members, to talk to
administrators. But I have. in
my committee work. and , . .
there are offices where I just
could go, just to say hello to
someone. And I guess there's
not a day that doesn’t go by
where I talk to some
administrator, or sotne faculty
member, about something
besides my own courses,
something that pertains to the
college as a whole,

Matt Moreland

Other than being a student
and dealing with faculty, there
hasn‘t been much. I’ve dealt
with the faculty in talking with
them about starting groups on
campus. My work in the
administration hasn‘t been much.
I haven't had much experience
there. I don’t feel that I’m going

to be lacking because of that. I
think the way I interact with
people, I can just fall in and not
have any problem with that
because I can think on my fect,I
can talk with people, express
what students are telling me,
what needs to be done. I can go
to the admi 'strution with that. I
don't see it as that big a problem.
I can see that experience might be
helpful, but I don't think I'll
have a problem.

Alanna Tyler

With the faculty, most of my
dealing has bccn in the role of a
student. Because that is the way
I would come to them, as a
student, I think that that’s pretty
valuable. On issues of
curriculum, I’ve talked in-
dividually with different
professors about the curriculum,
but beyond the classroom and
individual conversations I haven‘t
had much experience With the
faculty. With the administration,
Icome into Contact with them all
the time as part of the Office of
Community Rights Mediation
Team, the Community Service
Center Advisory Board, and as a
student adviser. Also, through a
lot of activities that I‘ve done
with the black students, I’ve had
an opportunity to interact a lot
with the administration. It’s
been a fair amount, but again,
it's been the kind of interaction
that just your average Joe Student
has and that is what I think is
important.

How will you do this job differently than

Rob Killion?

Jefff Fields

Well, first of all, we’re two
very different people with two
very different styles. 1 would, I
think, be a more forward and
direct, possibly obnoxious, vice-
presidcnt. I like confrontation
and I think I'd be more inclined
to, when I disagree with faculty
or administrators, to pursue our
differences, to not so much to
agree to disagree, but to come to
a conclusion where it satisfies
both of us. not just the faculty
member or the adminstrator. I
think it’s important that the
students, I guess, keep fighting.
You know,1don'tlikc to use the
word “fighting," but keep
pushing for an improved
curriculum. I’d like to go back
to the cun'iculum we had a year
ago. which was, as far as tlle
number of courses, and the
number of students it served, it
served the student body a hell of a
lot better. Right now, our
curriculum. our course offerings.
is about, I would guess, a
hundred shortages. It serves a

- hundred students less than we

have, forcing a lot of students to
be in classes where they
shouldn’t be, because they're the
extra people. But. returning to
the question, I think I’d be, to
sum it up, a more obnoxious
vice-president.

Matt Moreland

Nothing against Rob, 1 think
he’s done a great job, but maybe
the workload is such that you
don‘t seem to see people in SGA
acti

. the Open,

Forum—getting people's Views
on things rather than relying on
the senators, I’d like to be *
around more and just talk with A
people, whether it be in the
dining halls, just hanging out.
there and talking with people. or
just in general, because I feel like ‘
I’m a very social person and I can K
talk with lots of people and know
their views. That‘s a big thing I «
would change there, just a wider
representation of the students.
Alanna Tyler .
One thing that I know I‘ll do
very differently than Rob is I’
don‘t think that I‘ll be as zealous
as the vice-president has been this
year, Rob has done his vice-4
presidential duties and then some.
I’m going to do it my way,‘
which would be to do less of the.
“and-thenrsome" kinds of duties.
Basically, all of the things Rob
has done I would continue to do
and I would probably try to have
more interaction with [hev
students. I think Rob has done a
really good job in trying to keep’
the students informed on issues
of curriculum, but I want for the
average Joe Student to know
more about the curriculum and
also for the average Joe Student
to feel like he should know more
about the curriculum, I really
can‘t say that there are many
things that I would do very
differently from Rob because I
think he's done the job in a
commendable way. However, I
don’t think that Rob and I are cut
from the same cloth in terms of
our perception of what the vice-
prcsident is supposed to do '
