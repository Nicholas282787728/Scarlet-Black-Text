Student

Decries
Sex1sm

To the Editor:

Recently, I have noticed several
incidents on campus which have
bothered me because they
discriminate against women I’ll
start with the movie last weekend,
“at: Weeks.” Irealizethatcampus
movies are selected because they
are popular amidst the general
public, get good reviews, or
whatever. So, if we have to have
sexually exploitive films because
they are popular, they should at
least exploit both men and women
equally, To illustrate my point, it
seemed like the female lead strips
ped at least once every ten
minutes, and the male lead barely
got past his dinner jacket,

Another incident Occurred at the
Grinnell VS Coe basketball game.
Certain cheers bothered me
because i thought they were rude,
but i reminded myself to not be so
sensitive. After all, the cheers
were in a “healthy spirit of com-
petition."Then some Grinnell
students held up a poster featuring
[our scantily clad young persons
(guess which gender7t to distract
the opponent it was sortol funny,l
guess, but afterward I was
dismayed at the disrespect those
students demonstrated toward
women and toward themselves.

Finally, who is responsible for
putting the magazine “College
Woman" and ”Student Life" \sce
pg 13) in the post ofﬁce" They con
tain some of the most offensive
material 1 have seen in a long time.
In fact, I thought this one article
was a satire until I looked at the
rest of the magazine. Perhaps the
editors believe that they are
publishing informative articles for
mainstream students, Now that is
a distressing concept because it
means that l and most of my
friends live way out on the
perimeter, and i thought we were
all fairly normal. Hopefully the
editors are playing a cruel joke
because I'm graduating this year.
and it my cohorts actually like that
stuff, it means I'll be working and
voting with those people, not
something to eagerly anticipate.

Through this letter, I don't in
tend to censor anyone, 1 just wish
that people would act with more
respect. — Lorelei Kelly, lstxx

Scarlet and Black

Newmark Vilified

To the editor:

It irritates me to see the
columns ofJoliii Newmark take
up space in the scarlet and
Black, Newmark seems ilicas
pable or using whatcvcr inter
lectual faculties at his disposal
to formulate independent opins
ions based upon rational analy.
sis of the issues; he instead sinr
ply submits whatever issue he
discusses to a political litmus
test and gives a typical knee-
jcrk reaction in accordance with
mindless political dogma. Since
one can easily predict his stance
on any given issuc, reading
his column becomes superflu-
oils: Blank space, in tact, would
provide more stimulation than
Newnidrk's anti-intellectual ed-
itorial spasms.

But while 1 have long been
irked by Newnmrk‘s mindless
columns, it is his latest bit of
editorial cmuvia which requires
refutation. Speciﬁcally, 1 sin
alarmed by Newniark’s sugges-
tion that “There ought to be a
law“ to suppress television pro~
grains which Newniark deems to
be ovcrly commcrcial. This ape
pcal for the suppression of a
type of television show (no mat-
tcr how conteinptible the show
may be) smacks of cultural fas-
cism. That Newmark’s initial

attempt to promote “liberal"
ideology ends with an appeal
for mindless censorship is tacit
proof of his failure to reason cos
herently, lf certain cartoons are
suppressed simply because they
are deemed unacceptable, what
is next on Ncwniaik’s “uni-LC»
ceptable” list? if Newmark is
disgusted with certain types of
Tv shows, l suggest that the
best solution is that HE NOT
WATCH THEM instead of call.
ing for their suppression.

Not only can I not counter
unnce his “ﬁnal solution" to the
Tv cartoon problem, but New-
mark is naive in his assertion
that Tv networks hove only re—
cently focused on the commcr-
cisl aspects of tclcvision over so»
cially rcdcsming programming.
Television networks have always
looked to their own profits ﬁrst;
they are after all businesses in
a competitive market. Ncw-
lnark's naive statements are livs
ing proof that, as Flauhcrt once
said, “it is ignorance of history
which makcs us vilify our own
age’ﬁ

i hope that in future columns,
ivlr. Ncwruark will think before
he writes and cease bcsmirching
the SSLB with his editorial disr-
rhea. Matthew c. Macho

Election Board

To the Editor:

lam writing this letter to praise
both Paul Froese and especially
election committee chairperson,
Annette Brown Paul brought life
to the race for the SGA presidency
(even though he did not support
forensics). Paul may have made a
mockery of SGA with his platform
of ignorance, but wasn't it his right
to do 50’! Paul did meet the
eligibility requirements to run for
president and therefore he was
eligible. l have the nttermost
respect for Annette Brown for not
interfering in any way with his
campaign and I iurthei- respect

on this campus have a right to elect
whomever they wish to be their

gratulate those people such as An-

decide for themselves. I would

Recognition

Dear Mikhail,

If you decide to annihilate the
United States, i would like you to
consider bombing me first i am
5‘6" with light brown hair, blue
eyes, and size 9‘,‘ shoes. If this in
formation is insufficient for you to
set a homing device for a missile,
just drop me a line and I will wear
a Tsshirt with a large bull'sseye on
it with the caption, “Over here!”
written underneath in Russian.
(By the way, what is Russian for
“Over here!"7)

I have decided to be the first
firstsstrike target for three
reasons. First, I believe I will have
a greatly enhanced appreciation ol
the dangers of nuclear war if my
butt is on the line first. Secondly,
lite after a nuclear holocaust would
be just too icky even to think of
Thirdly, l desire cheap media at
tention.

i believe these are good enough
reasons for you to deploy at least
one multi-millionvruble nuclear
warhead pointed in the direction of
my pate Aw. c'mnnnnnnnl 7 Ken

F.S. DD ya suppose you could get
one for my friend Dave. too?

“ '
Exorbitant
Spending”
Cr1t1c1zed

To the Editor:

On Tuesdays and Thursdays I sit
on one of 15 expensive, velvety
pink, conferencesroom chairs in
the psychology wing of the science
building, At last week's questions
and-answer session in South
Lounge, George Drake admitted
that he did not know about these
luxurious chairs. According to one
psychology professor, they are
worth over $900 apiece.

I had also asked President Drake
about the tombstones which iden-
tify the buildings around campus
and about the $40,000 logo, He
responded to my concern over
Grinnell’s exorbitant spending by
justifying the importance oi public
relations. He mentioned that
visitors might be “offended" by
the supposed unfriendlmess of be
ing given a map which had no cor-
responding signs.

Saying the words "public rela
tions" gives me Chills and makes
me sweat, so I shall not delve intoa
thrashing of the high price of an
image. i suppose that tour leaves
and “Grinnell College" used to of~
fend visitors. And when I told
President Drake that his NOT
KNOWlNG about the chairs con
cerned me even more than the
mere cost of them, he replied,
“There's a lot I don't know about."

Alumnus Challenges

Graduating Seniors

To the Graduating Class

As an alumnus of Grinnell. I
serve as my class fund director
and as chairman oi the Alumni
Board's Annual Fund Committee.
in the latter capacity, 1 recently
had the pleasure of meeting with
several of your classmates to
discuss ways of encouraging a
habit of giving among you.

To me, 20 years later, Grinnell is -
still a wonderful place — intelleCs
tual, passionate, egalitarian. full of
idealism and promise, It is my 02.
I believe this same sense of magic
tand appreciation) is shared by
many of my classmates. i would
like to know if it is shared by you.

From my perspective, the will~
ingness of each of you to give
something to Grinnell has a special
signilicance. For my classmates
and l, the Grinnell experience is
long ago and olten far away we
like to think that Grinnell offers the
same kind of wonderful experience
for today's students that it did for
us Zo—add years ago. But, frankly,
we are not in a very good position
to know.

You are. As soon-to—be alums,

Froese Hurt

you are in a unique position to
make a statement about what your
Grinncll education has meant to
you Because I know the typical
senior is not in a position to give
very much. i would like to sweeten
the pie tor your first gift,

Accordingly, i promise that I
will personally give five dollars for
each senior giit tthc amount is not
important) to the annual fund this
fiscal year. As a further incentive,
if, before graduation. you as a
class are able to match or teven
betterl exceed my own class's
record of 60% participation last
year, I will donate an extra five
hundred dollars in the name of the
class of 1988.

My own view is that annualslund
giving is on the basis of need — not
the college's need, but your need
(and my need) to recognize Grin
nell's importance in our lives. The
amount of your gift is not impor-
tant; the spirit and the act of giVs
ing are. i hope you share my view.
1 look forward to your response, 7

More

Than He can Say

To the Editor:

it is with heavy heart that I write
this letter. I feel that l have let you
down. However, there comes a
time in every man's life when he
must make a decision that will
break hrs heart. Because of per-
sonal problems and political
pressure, 1 was iorced out of the
SGA presidential capaign. There is
nothing i wanted more in this life
than to be SGA president, When I
entered this campaign, I had not
originally planned to drop out of
the race. it hurts me more than i

can say, and I will forever be forcs
ed to live with this decision, My
sincerest apologies go out to all the
wonderful people who gave me
their support these last few weeks.
Although i was forced off the
ballot, l hoped you showed your
political opinion by writing me ill,I
hope that the other candidates
have learned something from my
campaign and are considering me
for a cabinet position, Maybe next
