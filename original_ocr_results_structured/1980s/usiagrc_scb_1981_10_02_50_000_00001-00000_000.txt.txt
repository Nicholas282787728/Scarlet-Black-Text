Riding the storm out: radicalism revisited
politics, parties 1966-1970

An alum’s view of pot,

by Marilyn l. Clark

Upon sitting down in Grinnell House for
his interview, Gary Giddins, ’70, reﬂected
on the changes that have occurred at
Grinnell since he graduated, and
remarked. “Eleven years ago there was a
revolutionary passion at Grinnell.
Students were extremely paranoid. We
actually believed Minute-men where going
to come from northern Iowa." With
that as his opening statement Giddins went
on to candidly discuss varied topics from
the political fervor on campus to the Wild
parties he attended during the late 1960s.

Giddins, who was an English major and
editor of Montage, a literary magazine,
while at Grinnell, was on campus last
week to address a Scholars’ Convocation.
Recently he published a highly acclaimed
book Riding on a Blue Note-Jan and
American Pop. At the present time he is a
full»time columnist for the Village Voice in
New York.

Looking back to his years at Grinnell,

Giddins said that ”Grinnell was one of the -

most radical small colleges in the country
during the late 19605. We were not as well-
known as Berkeley or the University of
Michigan, however, because Grinnell did
. not get the media attention these schools
did.” An example of the political fervor on
campus was active student involvement in
SGA at that time. According to Giddins,
“Almost the entire campus would attend
SGA meetings because of the sensitive
issue of student involvement in the war."

Giddins noted, however, that the in-
cident at Kent State in 1970 was a major
turning point for student political in-
volvement, because it was a sign that the
19605 had ended." Grinnell responded in
many different ways in the aftermath of
Kent State. Students took over the ROTC
building then located at 8th and Park
Streets and turned it into a study hall.
Shortly thereafter the college ﬂag was
turned upside down. Other students,
sympathetic with the war protest, took out
a full-page ad in the New York Times. At
another time, crosses Where placed
around the campus with ROTC student
names on them. Finally, Giddins added,
“A number of students and faculty
members spent a week after Kent State at
the bio-preserve drinking, reading and
smoking dope.”

Overall, Giddins described 1970 as “one
of the most difficult periods in Grinnell's
history." Because of the “apocalyptic
feeling" many people felt and the real fear
in the minds of many students that
Grinnell would be the next Kent State,
President Glenn Leggett closed the college
before the Commencement ceremony in
1970. Although the president gave are
students only 48 hours to leave campus,
Giddins commented that “Leggett handled
the situation with generosity and common
sense. If anything else had been done the
college might have crumbled down
because of students’ fears about the war. I
was proud the college was closed. We
received our diplomas several months
later.“

 

 

Turning to another outlet of student
protest Giddins mentioned the student
underground newspaper, Dteradacytl. He
described it as an outlet for student opinion
in addition to the 8&3. At one point the
5&8 was, however, taken over by students
when it was run by an editor sympathetic
with the campus protests. One problem
encountered by the students at this time
was censorshiplike tactics practiced by
the publishing company in town. This
company refused to print certain
questionable words found in the 5&5 and
Dteradacytl thereby forcing students to
have the newspapers printed outside of
Grinnell.

While at Grinnell, Giddins was social
coordinator and major concert chair-
person. ln addition to the political ac
tivities at Grinnell, he noted, “Many well»
known musical groups played here during
the late 19605. Among the groups that
came, some of the highlights were: Duke
Ellington, B.B. King, Jefferson Airplane,
Cecil Taylor, and Muddy Waters. Some of
these groups. however, were not well~
received by students on campus. Black
students wanted black radical rock bands,
While white students wanted white radical
rock groups. Despite this controversy,
Giddins believed that ”the emphasis on
jazz groups was appropriate at that time
because jazz spoke more directly to civil
rights than rock,” Giddins specifically
mentioned that the BB. King concert in
Darby was the best concert King ever

. gave. “After the show King sate down on

 

the stage and rapped with the audience
until B&G threw the students out,” he said.

One aspect of Grinnell which has not
changed since 1970 is the spots scene.
Giddins related one football locker room“I
incident where a coach was overheard
remarking, “. . . Guys , we don't have a
chance.” He concluded that “no one took
sports seriously."

Until 1963, Giddins’ junior year, south
campus housed women and north campus
housed the men. Women, moreover, had a
curfew enforced each night. According to
Giddins, however. “when some women
were locked out of their dorms, they were,
ironically, forced to go to the men’s side of
campus to sleep." But, Giddins em-
phasized that campus visitation policy was
strictly enforced. He said, “Three male
students were expelled for having a girl in
their rooms during non-visimtion hours.
Men could have women in their rooms
from 2-5 p.m. on Sunday, however." He
humorously added that ”a towel on your
doorknob was a general sign of visitation
in most male dorms."

In 1968, however, Younkers was divided
into a male and female section. Giddins
said, “This fostered a brotherlysisterly
feeling among the students and led the way
to more coed dorms later.” He Went on to
point out that the lack of coed dorms did
not prevent the students from holding
parties with interesting themes.

He candidly mentioned an event held
during two of his years at Grinnell called
the Gates Orgy. Giddins characterized this

event as a “drunken reverie” even though
the drinking age was 21 in lowa.
Describing the event, he said, “There were
mattresses on the ﬂoor in a rec room
located in Gates pit. The women were
invited to put their hands into a large jar
and pulled out a key to a male dorm
members room. They were then required
to go into this room, and somehow return
only when they were wearing a man’s
pajamas" Although Giddins reflected that
this event was fun, he said, “The practice
orgy which included grapes, cheese and
wine was even better."

Throughout the interview Giddins
emphasized that drugs and, especially,
politics characterized Grinnell during the
late l9605. He said, “when Ronald Reagan
was elected Governor of California, tears
were in the eyes of students from
California who watched the event on
television.” He also recalled that many
students viewed Harold Hughes, then
Governor of Iowa, as a hero who even
tually would become president.

Commenting about Grinnell as he views
it today, Giddins ended the interview on a
rather blue note, “I can’t understand how
students can get so worried about the post
office today. We had more important
issues then. No one would have thought
that the country would go go from Nixon to
Reagan. There really was a lot more
passion and enthusiasm on campus in the
late 19605,"‘ "‘ " ‘
