by Marty Merlotto

A major highlight oi last week's Cone
ference on Mediterranean Democracies
was the presence of Leonardo Paggi, a
proiessor at Italy's University oi Modena
and a member of the ltallan Communist
Party ilCP). At a lime when the italian
Communist Party is fast becoming a iorce
in both ltalian and Western European
politics Knew italian elections Could make
them the first democratically elected com-
munist government in historyl, many
Americans still see them as an enigma,

In an interview with the 5&3, Paggi
outlined the goals and aspirations of the

nell students can help in increasing the
American people's knowledge about the
-~true nature or ilalian Communism."
Paggi began the interview by attacking

the beliei that the iCF is similar. in
political organization, to the communist
parties of Soviet Europe and Eastern
Europe, "That cannot be done he claim-

East Europeans, "The italian Communist
Party is dedicated to working inside the
parliamentary system." He added, "To
this end we are more similar to the other
democratic parties of Euorpe than to the
Soviet Communist Party

majority in Parliament.” said Paggi The
ICP will support italy‘s Continued par-

Paggl's view oi NATu is similar to his
view oi the Common Market. Although ops
