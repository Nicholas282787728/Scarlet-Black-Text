Griffins Feel
Spark of Life

by Trevor Harris

The Grinnell Griffins are once
again out of the starting blocks and
racing head ﬁrst into the spring
season. The Griffins are once
again feeling the spark of life after
a iew semesters oi dwindling
membership and financial difficul-
ty. Practice began February 29,
due to the benign spiritual forces
which occur only once every rour
years. Something must have been
in the air that day, because the
Griffins are looking better than
they did back in 1843, and that was
a good year.

Still, the team is having its pro»
blems due to injuries. Bruce
“Alligator” Nissen, Chris “C
Jam” Jones, and Erik “08k~
Burch, all suffered knee and ankle
injuries and will be out until after
break due to their participation in
that dangerous and barbaric sport,
intramural basketball

The club is looking forward to
their first game against Newton on
April 9, here in Grinneli, and then
to its European Tour in early June
They are expected to be the
iavorites in the British World cup
match, in Edinburgh. The toughest
tournament this season will be the
Allvlowa Rugby Tournament
which will be held in Des Moines on
May 7-5. A Booze Cruise may be in
order.

The Grinnell Griffins Rugby
Club is an equal opportunity club
which encourages membership
from the students and staff of Grin-
nell College, and anyone in the city

On the
Schneid

by Eric D. Schneider

Last weekend the Grinnell men’s
swimming team won the Midwest
Conierence Swimming and Diving
Championships, and the men's his
door track-andrfield team finished
a strong second in the conference
championships. The weekend
before. the women's swim team
won the Midwest Conference
trophy, Why wasn’t there a ticker-
tape parade down Eighth Street?
Why Wasn't class Canceled on Mon-
day ior a big Pioneer rally on Cens
tral Campus? Why didn't George
Drake set upa panel discussion ex-
tolling the virtues of Grinnell
athletics?

Now fantasize that the Grinnell
football and basketball teams won
conrerence crowns. There pres
bably wouldn't be any major
celebration on campus, but the
campus would be abuzz over |he
success of those teams. Protests
would be raised that Grinneil Col-
lege was emphasizing sports too
much, and that Grinnell was
changing from a liberal-arts school
to a conservativesjock school, Nuns
athletes would become jealous and
accuse the school oi giving athletic
scholarships It would seem that
Grinnell was selling its U. S. News
and World Report top 10 ranking
tor the AP Top 10.

The difference between the two
stories is the reaction accorded to
the different sports. Football and
basketball are the Dynamic Duo of
college sports. The networks spend
millions of dollars and hundreds of
hours televising iootball and
basketball. The viewer becomes
brainwashed with the belief that
college football and basketball are
the only sports a university offers
For millions of viewers, the
reputation or a university is
associated with success on the fonts
ball field, not with success in the
classroom, At almost every
university, the football coach is
more famous than the college
president Case in point: Who ever
heard oi Edward Jennings until
Earle Bruce got fired? Columbia
received more news about its foot»
ball losing streak than was ever
written about their high-quality
academics. Aiter Georgetown won
the NCAA basketball tournament a
few years ago, applications to at-
tend G-ToWn rose 15 percent.
Perhaps the university should be
called Ewingtown,

On the other hand, college swims
ming is usually relegated to an oc~
casional segment on “CBS Sports
Saturday,“ sandwiched between
such major sports as barrelv
jumping from Oslo and the WBA
world junior-ilyweight-
championship fight. Television has
declared that swimming, with its
action underwater, is not exciting
enough for the sports viewer.
Besides trying to dispel the sense
at ennui associated with their
sport, women's swimming, along
with all other women's sports
teams, has to combat the sexism oi
the male sports fan, The
predominately male viewing au-
dience would much rather See
Christine Brinkley in a bathing suit
than Cynthia Woodhead. At the
University of North Carolina. the
women‘s soccer team has won six
straight NCAA tides, but the new
sports center is named alter Dean
Smith, who has won only one
basketball title. Thus. women's
sports enter into a sports twilight
zone, becoming insigniﬁcant to the
college sports tan and to the cam-
pus community.

Grinnell College prides itself on
indoctrinating students with the
joy of a liberal-arts education By
the end of four years, a Grinnellian
should be wellrrounded and should
be able to look at both sides of an
issue. The same should be true
with sports. The campus should
celebrate the success oi every
team equally, just as a liberal~
minded person should treat
everyone equally, Grinnell College
students should look at the whole
Grinnell sports ,pioture. where
there have been successes along
with failures The moaning about
the football and basketball teams
records should be tempered by the
trophies earned by the men's soc»
cer team, the men‘s cross-country
team, and both swrm teams. in-
stead oi lamenting that at this
point in time Grinnell College does
not excel at the “major“ sports.
Grinnell students should take pride
in the fact that there are successes
in many other sports There may
be a day when all the Grinnell
sports teams are at the top oi the
conference, but now is the time to
celebrate today's acompiishments,
Congratulations to the men's and
women's swim teams, and may
their success be fully appreciated.
