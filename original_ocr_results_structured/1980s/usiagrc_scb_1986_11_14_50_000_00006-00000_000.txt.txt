Students lazy
in defense
of divestment

This weekend the Board of Trustect
re meeting to reevaluate the policy a
South African Divestment; and this
weekend the student movement for
South African divestment tics in chaos
without any direction or vision. Eigh.
teen months ago, this campus came
live as the student body came together
to force the trustees to consider the
moral imperative of divestment. With
thoughtful and intelligent leadership,
the Students to End Apartheid has not
only able to mobilise students but the
group educated all of us to the imporA
tance of acting morally. In fact,
Students to End Apartheid was so e ffec-
tive in directing campus opinion that
the tructc'es agreed to a limited diocst.
ment after sixteen years of resistance to

student divestment efforts.

Today, with the Board’s divestment
policy in serious question, the college
community could not be more
disorganized, ignorant and apathetic
on the divestment issue.

Two years ago the opinion pages of
the newspaper were filled with curiotu
opinions on the divestment. Yet, this
year, not one opinion piece has ap-
peared on this page concerning divest-
ment, Two years ago, South Lounge
was filled with students listening to
South African students speaking of the
pain and horror of Apartheid; today
Smith Lounge will host a silly dedica-
tion to a renovated building.

’1! is apparent, Grintlell College has
become lazy in defense ofits moral and
political beliefs, Two years ago, this sttt.
deut body strttgglcd to rationally ar-
ticttlate why divestment was a moral
imperative. Now, the college can only
organize itself with a silly knee-jerk
demonstration of staking crosses in
central campus.

When negotiating with the trustees
two years ago, students had to over.
come the trustees’ belief that the
students were not committed to take the
consequence of divestment. But when
confronted by more than 200 students
stretched from Gardner Lounge to
Hurling Library, the trustees could not
help but be struck by the tremendous
support for diueltmenlt What must they
think now? Two years ago, students
fought to prove their commitment to
divestment. Today, with rampant
apathy and very poor leadership, the
South African divestment movement is
anything but committed to the cause of
divestment.

Divestment. like other moral objec-
tives, requires a xincere and long term
commitment. Moral objectives are not
attained quickly with a trendy display
ofconcern. Ifthis student body is really
committed to divestment, we must as a
group demonstrate a and
thoughtful commitment or we will have
wasted all the efforts of the past Grin»
ncllians to make this College on institu-
tion of moral integrity.

This past fall break he and his lover, an
athleticlooking guy, were driving up

and a cold drink.

The two oi them walked into the relief cl

A police otiicer sat on a stool at the
counter.

They were quiet and unobtrusive during
the entire meal, After paying the bill, they
got back into their car and started off.

They never once touched each other or
said anything to call attention to
themselves. They did nothing to indicate
that they were anything but two young
men driving somewhere north, They were
two ordinary travelers who had stopped
for a bite to eat.

0n the way out at town, flashing lights
appeared in the rearvlew mirror. The
uniformed officer had them step nut. of the
vehicle and spread-eagle themselves
against it. The top of the car was searingly

Their fear was reﬂected in the silvery

He told them that they had been disturb-

A few minutes later they were behind
bars,

friend and his companion, spat on them,

In the morning, they were released and
told to get out at town.

The two of them were quiet lor many
hours after that. Both were stunned.

When my friend returned home, his
mother gave him the third degree. Why
was he a day late, what in the hell had he
been up to, etc. He told her,

One of the great myths about Grinnell
College is that of the open mind. The
tendency of the student body to embrace
alternate lifestyles is mistaken for
tolerance. To make this cloaked in
tolerance explicn, consider how
Republicans are received among the
students. My point is that Grinnell College
is not a microcosmic paradise where no
one need fear censure for their beliefs or
lifestyle. Not here, nor anywhere else in
the world does the maxim “love lhy
neighbor as thy sell" reign supreme, nor
has it ever.

Whether people are educated to in.
tolerance or it is part of human nature, it is
a very real and signiﬁcant laclor in human
relations on any scale. The problem of prep
judlce IS complex; it there exists a solu-
tion, it will certainly not be easy To be
horriﬁed that Grinnell is not a haven from
intolerance, ignorance and hatred IS a
naively idealistic reaction and is not par-
ticularly helpful ln dealing with the pro.
blem. The world of “peace, love and
understanding” is a fiction and dreaming
about it does nol suggest a course of prac-
tical action.

right, if he was unhurl.

A year earlier, before my friend had
revealed his sexual prelerence to his
mother, such an unsympathetic welcome
would never have existed. Where once he
had been her favorite son, now he was like
a stranger in her eyes.

She could hardly bring hersell to look
directly at him anymore.

Surprising. Now it seems as though

There has been an increase in the

Court upheld explicitly prohibits “any sex-
ual act involving the sex organs at one per-
son and the mouth or anus of another,"

The implications of the decision are
lightening. Individual ireedotn and the
right to privacy of not only homosexuals
but everyone becomes a decision of the
stale. Though the law is extremely dif-
ficult to enforce. and officials don’t expect
an increase in prosecutions, 24 states still
have anti»sodomy laws on the books. In
some, the maximum penalty can reach 20
years.

Justice Harry Blackmun, who was
against the outcome of the 5-4 Supreme
Court decision, commented on the ruling:
“Depr'lv'lng individuals of the right to
choose for themselves how to conduct their
intimate relationships poses a far greater
[threat to the values most deeply rooted in
our nation’s history than tolerance oi non-
conformity could ever do . ,"

Indeed, this threat is felt.

In addition, gay leaders are airatd that
decisions like these are hindering their
drive for suclal toleration and pushing [ear
and distrust more and more into the
forefront of people's minds,

Grinnell is [ending toward such a slate at
unGrinnell-like behavlor. The ignorant
and malicious attitudes ol a few close-
mlnded people are reﬂecting on the entire
student body.

Is Grinnell, this laid-back, tolerant, lio-
your—ownrthing, peaceful little campus
destined to become a hotbed of unrest, prep

the sort. of attitude lound in a small

No.
