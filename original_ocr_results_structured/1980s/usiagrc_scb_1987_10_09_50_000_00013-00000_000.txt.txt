”A View of Her Own: Images of
Women by Women Artists" is cur-
rently on display in the Burling
Library Print and Drawing Study
Room. Susan Strauber, instructor
of art, and Kay Wilson, registrar of
Grinnell's Permanent Art Collec-
Lion, organized this exhibition to
highlight the activities of women
artists working in the late 19th- and
early 20th£entury traditions of
Western art. From the point of
View of art history, this exhibition
reflects recent efforts to
acknowledge the unique artistic vi-
sion and technical mastery of
previously overlooked female ar-
tists. The Show is also significant
as an indicator of the individual
woman’s changing sell-concept
during this period of feminist
reform,

Among the betterrknown artists
represented in “A View of Her
Own" are Bertha Morisot. Suzanne
Valadon, and Gwen John, women
whose past successes were aided
by their associations with male ar-

tists of renown. But the focus of the
exhibition is upon artists whose
talents and originality far exceed
their modest reputations. While
name recognition of these women
may be slight, their creative
endeavors are no less powerful.
Exemplary is Doris Porter Caesar,
who presents a highly original cons
ception of the female nude in her
bronze slatuette of 1966 entitled
“Kneeling Woman,” Here, the ar»
list synthesizes feminine sensuali
ty and fertility with masculine
strength; the undulations of full
breasts and a protruding abdomen
are countered by well-defined
musculature in the shoulders and
arms.

Such an androgynous selir
concept contrasu markedly with
the feminine ideal as advanced
just 20 years earlier by American
artist Mabel Lisel Ducasse. Her
pastel drawing that is included in
this exhibition, “Serenity," por-
trays a woman with legs crossed
and hands resting on her lap. The

Joseph Holmes

Dance Theatre
to Perform Tonight

by Paula Briggs

”Technically and emotionally
quite dazzling," said Chicago
Tribune’s Sid Smith in his descrip-
tion of the Joseph Holmes Dance
Theatre. As the [male of Black
Awareness Week, the
predominantlyrblack. Chicago»
based troupe will be performing
tonight at 3:30 P.M. in Roberts.
Begun in 1974, the Dance Theatre
has worked its way into Chicago’s
cultural mainstream.

Artistic director Randy Duncan
leads the company members, as
well as apprentices, in original
choreography. Favorite numbers
of the group include “Aretha.” per-
formed to a medley of Aretha
Franklin songs, and pieces ranging
from classical ballet to African to

 

American gospel. The company
uses minimum lighting and
costuming, as they pre[er to let
athletic intenstiy and subtle grace
create the mood.

JHDT tours regionally and na-
tionally but still participates in its
Chicago community with the
“Chance to Dance” program. This
program was developed as an
outreach to disadvantaged youth in
the inner city in order to introduce
them to dance not only as an art,
but also as a discipline and voca-
tion. This program has been sup-
ported by the city of Chicago with a
City Arts II Challenge Program
Grant and by the Lloyd A. Fry
Foundation.

subject does not engage the viewer
but instead directs her glance
away with a downward tilt of her
head. A vase of flowers and a
demitasse cup on a nearby table
complete this depiction of proprie-
ty and feminine grace.

Beside its significance in art
historical and social contexts, this
exhibition provides an exciting
visual experience. The variety of
media represented is extensive:
paintings, sculptures, drawings,
fabrics, prints, and photos. Also of
particular interest are portraits of
three famous women: Sarah Ber
nhardt (“Sell-Portrait as a
Sphinx" or “Fantastic Inkwell"),
Gertrude Stein, and Meryl Streep.

The exhibition will run through
October 31. Hours for the Print and
Study Drawing Room are l:15
RM. to 5 PM, Sunday through
Friday. With prior arrangements,
other hours are possible for
groups. Gallery talks by Grinnell
students can also be arranged by
contacting Kay Wilson at 2693371.

Berger Reﬂects on Exhibit

by Brian Berger

Yo G~men and women. get
yourself down to the Burling
Library “gallery” and check out
the current women’s art exhibit.

I was skeptical when I got this
assignment, thinking that this ex
hibit was all going to be ultra-
radical feminist stuff, like a visual
Andrea Dworkin book. I was
wrong. The 30 odd artists featured
here are all women, but they repre»
sent many different attitudes

- towards life and art. There are

works that have introspective.
socially conscious, homoerotic,
and heterosexual images in this ex
hibit. The Print and Drawing Study
Room is a cramped, well-lit nut
and the clutter does detract
somewhat from some of the pieces,
With help from my friend Al “Art
is my Life” Muntzner, here are
some words that will impress your
friends and relatives: composition,
color, line, form, perspective,
medium. texture, and symbolism.

Some artists names and my
comments

Sally Michel ~ oil. pastas,
mutated proportions, good color.
simple forms.

June Wayne 7 cool~ass green
and earth tones. Nice series of
cubist like writhing bodies:

lmogen Cunningham » some
picture or Gertrude Stein. No org-
gie. The picture that is 7 Gertrude
herself is looking pretty hefty.

Claire Prussian — nude lady
with huge, grotesque vaginal area.
Real cool and interesting What‘s it
mean?

Leibovitz m Yes, it's Annie. And
she makes Meryl streep look real
hot and naturally effervescent.

Peggy Bacon 7 “Fat,” fat ugly
woman in dark clothes in fall. Good
image.

Minna Citron _ good picture of
masculinized female worker.

Laurie Ourlicht — one of the best
pieces, “Great Cousin Emma.” An
old black woman in church, strong
but muted colors...

Faith ,Ringgold 7 ”Miss Jones
Family” Interesting soft sculpture
of black family. Mother has on a
“Shirley Chisolm for President"
,button. See Hunter S. Thompson's
“Fear and Loathing: On the Cam-
paign Trail '72" for more Chisolm
information.

Mary Mullineux — rad woodcut
or artist in Provincetown...with
boats, ocean...pastels.... if you
were ever there, you'll recognize
the imagery,

Leonor Fini “Female
Chimera” fairly cool, greeting
card like, evil looking.

Judy Deter — cool black and
white gypsy and baby, photo out of
iocus...Satanit angle?

Sarah Bernhardt —— “Self Por-
trait as a Sphinx" neat and
satanic, like “the Exorcist."

Beatrice Whitney Van Ness —
”Woman in Bathing Suit.” Real
good, powerful, erotic. Woman unr
dressing, ocean beating against
the rocks.

So there you have it, my guide to
the art exhibit. The exhibit is a
good thing to have at Grinnell not
only because its a good study break
while in Burling, but also because
it will bring some much needed
“prestige” to this stagnant and in»
decisive institution, I’m sure Wally
Walker will show this to some
reporters from “US News and
World Report" or some visiting
deans who vote on that survey. Hey
Wally, if you are reading this when
you are done viewing the women's
art. check out some of the men’s
art in the basement bathroom. You
are the inspiration for many new
works.
