“Gong xi fa cal!” ”Gong he fa
'choyl" “A happy and prosperous
new year!” whether one speaks
Mandarin. Chinese, or English,
new year's greetings are in order
as Wednesday, February 17,
marks the start of the Chinese New
Year. .

Following the lunar calendar,
Chinese New Year begins on the
first'day of the new moon, and so
the date varies irom year to year.
Each year is named atter one ol 12
animals which are believed to
characterize the special qualities
or people born in that year. This
year is the auspicious Year oi the
Dragon It is said persons born in
the dragon year tend to be
energetic, excitable, shorts
tempered, and stubborn. Previous
dragon years include ms, 1964,
1952, 1940, and 1928.

The lzryear cycle that makes up
the Chinese zodiac dates to an an-
cient legend. Thousands oi years
ago. Buddha called lor all the
animals of the world to come to
hear his teachings. The only 12 to
come were (in order) the rat, ox,
tiger, hare, dragon, snake. horse.
sheep, monkey. rooster. dog, and
pig. As a reward for their piety, a
year was named alter each animal
so that they would be remembered
and could give the humans born in
their year their traits.

From these to zodiac symbols. a
person‘s iortunc can be told, as
well as one's character traits,
strengths. and weaknesses. The
natal year not only dictates Oile's
personality but also determines
one's matrimonial affairs. Some
animals are compatible, whereas
others will never get along. For ex~
ample, people born in the dragon
, year should ideally marry so-
meone born in the rat, snake,
monkey, or rooster year but never
someone irom the year oi the dog.

Although strict observance of
these superstitions is largely
‘passe,’ the New Year remains the
foremost holiday for the Chinese,
akin to Christmas in the Occident.
A national holiday in both the Peo-
Dle‘s Republic of China and

Gong He Fa Choy!
Chinese Welcome Year of the Dragon

Taiwan, it is a time for family reu-
nions and sumptuous feasts.

“Even in the Cultural Revolus
tion, people were very careiul, but
we still had this holiday," said
Chin Yu, a native of Shanghai,
China.

“It is a time ror eating and peo-
ple getting together..The major
thing {or Chinese is eating, Dinner
would he seven or eight different
dishes." Chin remembered.

The traditional foods are rich in
symbolism for the families' sues
cess in the new year. .liaozi tmeat
dumplingst are made because oi
the “2i" character also means
“sons.” The Chinese words for fish
and chicken are homonyms ior
“plenty and to spare" and "for
tunate." Pork, being latty.
represents lertility and r’lun-
dance.

Along with the propserity and
happiness, iamily unity is much
desired tor the new year. As a
result, the holiday time is marked
by a period oi gettogethers with
tamily and iriends.

“We used to have three days off
[in China]. The first day, the
younger generation would go Visit
the higher generations or pro»
fessors and teachers. The second
day, you're supposed to visit the
people oi the same generation —
I'd visit my iriends. The third day,
you‘re still visiting and eating. it
was very relaxing. i do miss this
holiday. Chin said,

Patrick Moran, proiessor oi
Chinese language, who spent seven
years studying in Taiwan,
remembered the pleasant at-
mosphere of the new year‘s holi-
day. “Everyone comes back home,
It‘s like our Christmas dinner, All
New Year's Day, you can't say
anything bad, you can't scold
anyone or raise your voice in
anger. You can only say good
things."

still, the new year‘s celebra-
tions’ iire crackers and dragon
dances make it one of the most
boisterous or holidays.

It was this aspect that struck

studied in Taiwan ”Firecrackers!
Everywhere! It was as if the island
were at war 11‘: amazing."

“I remember a dragon proces-
sion, schoolboys and teenagers
running everywhere, throwing
firecrackers everywhere. and little
children being frightened," he
said.

The iestive air is especially ex-
citing to children Besides dragon
parades, orecrackers, candy. and
nian gao iglutinous rice cakes),
special jiaozl dumplings are made
with coins, peanuts, and dates in-
side.

"if you bite into money, you‘re
going to be wealthy. It you bite into
a peanut, longevity. lryou bite into
one with a date, you'll have a hap-
py year," Ellen Shang, class at ’39,
explained, “We'd all eat until we
could get one or each. You get wet
ty tulll"

Another custom is to give
children red envelopes with money
inside. The envelopes are to re-
main in their pockets or under
their pillows while they sleep. This
way. when they wake up on New
Year’s Day, they will have money
to begin the new year, an omen oi
propser‘tty.

Chinese New Year is such an im-
portant holiday that it transcends
national boundaries and is
celebrated by most overseas
Chinese,

Jenny Tsang, a native of Hong
Kong, studied in England for two
years. Around Chinese New Year’s
time, she would travel to London,
as did many Chinese students, “In
London they celebrated it a lot.
Just like in Hong Kong. People still
gave the lucky money,

For many American-born
Chinese and ChineserAmericans,
the holiday is an important link

\
with their parents culture and
heritage. although it Often also
serves as a reminder of the dif-
ferences between them and their
other "American” classmates.
These differences do not have to be
negative.

“When i was living in Brooklyn,
for Chinese New Year it was sort of
a tradition — l’d lug some shrimp
chips [potatorchiprlike snacks] to
school and teach everyone to say
‘Gong he ia choy.’ Every year i‘d
have to do that, but i enjoyed it, i
couldn't iigure out why they didn‘t
like the shrimp chips, though,"
Melinda Chu said.

The Year or the Dragon marking
her third year in Grinnell, Chu said
she misses celebrating the holiday
since she left New York for Iowa.
”I miss the family reunions, the
whole tradition. It's neat. It's
something ditterent."

Sometimes the holiday is a
reminder of conflicting values
within a family, when immigrants’
children have adopted different
cultural values and ideas.
Sometimes the old ways the holi-
day represents are difficult to
reconcile with their own changing
beliefs. However, just because fun-
damental values have changed
between generations, this does not
necessarily result in sharp clashes
between parents and children,

For example, the Chinese New
Year is also imbued with much
religious significance. It is a time
tor visits to temples and tor
remembering ancestors with otter-
ings ot iood, incense, and paper
money before the ancestral tablet
shrine set up in the home,

some or the new year‘s religious
rituals practiced in her home
before she came to Grinnell.

"My parents are still
Buddhists..,[My mother] would
burn some [fake] paper money
and say something. Tea was put in
the bigger tea cup and wine in a
small cup, and she'd pour some or
each on the ground. Then she‘d let
the food sit for a while. There'd be
incense. Then she'd warm up the
food, and we'd eat it. The food was
supposed to represent “abundance
and variety: so the gods would be
happy... ,

“I miss my iamily, the good
cooking, but I don't miss the ritual
because I don't believe in it, It's

respect my parents’ culture, i
realize it is part oi their culture,

those feelings,” Lee said.
