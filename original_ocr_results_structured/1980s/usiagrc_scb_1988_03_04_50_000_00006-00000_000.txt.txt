Editor’s “Biased”

Questions

To the Editor:

A meeting last Saturday between
the SGA presidential and vice
presidential candidates and
Scarlet and Black edito lnrchief
Dave Jones was held to discuss the
nature at the S and B interviews
and subsequent endorsements. In
that meeting, Dave assured the
candidates that all 14 questions he
planned to ask were pertinent to
knowing all there was to know
about a particular candidate, both
ior the ensuing endorsements and
ior the student body, After much
discussion, all candidates agreed
that it 14 questions were
necessary, then they would be will-
ing to answer them. My speciﬁc
qualm rests upon two particular
questions put to my opponent.
Greg Evans. On page 7 oi the s and
B special edition, Greg Evans was
asked, “Who would you like to see
as SGA vice president?” I fail to
see the relevance oi that question
to either Greg‘s campaign or the
elections in general. For myseli
and those I’ve spoken with on this
issue, the answer to this question
couldn‘t possibly change my 0in
man oi Greg as SGA president in
one way or another. The only possr
ble reaction 1 could have to Greg's
answer would aiiect my vote ior
the SGA Vice president, not the
SGA president. why couldn't Dave
have asked Greg “0“ the record”?
in other words, exactly why were
the question and the answer
printed in the s and B7 Your
answer is as good as mine, but i
would say it blends in beautifully
with the question asked before it,
The previous question read, “What
is your opinion oi people with no
SGA experience running ior presi-
dent?" I can picture a situation
where this question could be rele-
vant, but there seems to be
something quite “fishy” about the

origin oi both questions. Basically,
what I mean is that the two ques-
tions posed above were to Greg
Evans and Greg Evans only. No
other candidates were asked who
they would like to see as SGA vice
president, or their opinions about
experience in san. instead, the
other candidates answered ques
tions that were very relevant to
their standpoints and campaigns.

The point oi this editorial is sim
ple; the questions posed by Dave
Jones reilected an obvious bias. ii
the endorsement and interview
processes are continued next year,
i believe that the only way to pre-
vent this bias is to ask all can
didates the same questions, and to
submit the questions to all can-
didates ior ratiiication, — Brad
Sheridan

Editor's Note: in every discussion
oi the interviews, it was explained
to the candidates that they would
he asked ii the same set oi ques»
tions as their opponents: and 2) up
to three questions speciﬁcally p05»
ed to each individual candidate.
These questions to the individual
candidates were meant to elicit
responses irom the candidate that
might shed more light on his or her
campaign. By as i g Greg Evans.
"What is your opinion oi people

with no SGA experience ruiiuiiig .

ior president?” we hoped to shed
such light. Greg Evans has had
mncli expc ence in SGA. and ivc
iclt that his answer to this question
might aid readers in evaluating
him as a candidate.

mum, on SGA vicerprcsidcntial
candidate with a great deal at SGA
experience, was posed the same
question. though Mr. Killion's
dealt \tith the presidential race.

on Athletics

To the Editor:

I am writing concerning a letter
which appeared in a recent soils.
The authors of the letter Called for
a new, lowekey approach to Grins
nell athletics and criticized Grin-
nell‘s ”athletic revival" as being
detrimental to the student body
and to the character of this college.

I agree wholeheartedly with the
authors when they state that indif-
ference to athletics is not
necessarily a bad thing. However,
I disagree with the other assertions
put iorth in the letter.

The authors lament the loss of
“traditional Grinnell ideas" in
which athletic teams are “clubs
ior iriends to get together and have
a good time after they have ﬁnish-
ed their academic work." It ha
been my experience that Grinnel
athletics serve exactly that func-
tion. Friends get together not only
to have a good time, but to relieve
stress and to participate in an an
tivity which they enjoy.

Another claim was that “the
athletic teams now take
themselves far too seriously,” and
to support this incredible state-
ment. the authors cite response to
Grant Ehrlich's series of articles
about the cross-country team.
Grant “suffered a stinging
response" irom myself and others
not because he “put personal
enrichment and enjoyment above
an allrconsuming desire to win,”
but because we felt that his are
ticles were in bad taste and went
irom bad to intolerable, and we
could no longer stitle a response

Vic would also add that ltoh l“”10“athletesil’ersmalenﬁy'

merit and enrichment is the reason
they participate in athletics.

pm just writing in to say that i
believe that the staii oi the sand B
did an amaerlg amount oi work on
the presidential issue in a very
short time. i thought it was very
proiessional and just a job well
done. l’m sure you will get a lot oi
crap ior that issue on political
grounds. But as a presidential cans
didate, i wish to remain as
apolitical as possible and simply
salute the stair tor the degree oi
proiessionalism exhibited. The on-

As students or the Grinnell Cole
lege community we would like to
express our concern about the
absence oi an immediate iuture ior
Women's History and other
Women's Studies courses. We pro-
pose hiring a llcw Women's History
proiessor or retaining the pres
iessor who is currently teaching
Women’s History on a temporary
basis. it is an outrage that this
position will not be renewed or
made permanent for the mods
academic year.

As is painiully apparent. Grin-
nell College lacks the necessary
Women’s Studies courses that
other highly ranked liberal arts
colleges oiier and deem vital to a
well»rounded liberal-arts educa»
tion. Swarthmcre College, ior exV
ample, oiiers an interdepartmen-
tal major and minor, with courses
in Women’s Studies such as
Women in Music and Women in in-
dustrial Society. Accompanying in-
terdepartmental courses are the
expected core courses in various
departments that pertain to
Women's studies such as Women's
History. Women's Literature, and
Women in the arts

Like Swarthmore, Pomona has
oiiered its students a sophisticated
Women‘s Studies education since
1977, including an interdepartmenr
tal major and basic history courses
such as Women on the Frontier and
Family and Society in America:
The Rise oi the Modern Family

To the Editor:

i would like to address the Grlnr
nell student body with several con-
cerns oi mine, brought to the
ioreiront by the passage or the
peace Day Initiative ior Relays:

Apparently. Relays needed to be
changed, and the peace Day was
chosen as the best solution
available. The new peace Day
would bring. educational booths
and various bands and speakers to
campus, thercby making the last
day oi Relays an educational and
idealistic event. I hate to
discourage hat kind oi well~
intentioned i tiative, but my cons
cern is that peace nay may
become a “party ior peace” at
worst, and a naive, rather shallow
event at best.

The larger issue that the propos-
ed Peace Day brought to mind was
my uneasiness with the depth oi
Grinnell's values rirst oiall, I am
concerned by the emphasis on

vides courses such as Women,
Violence, and SelirDefense to add
diversity to their Women's Studies
curriculum, in their course
catalog the college supports this
area of study based on their beiiei
that “women’s studies enables a
student to develop a iuller
understanding oi seli in relation to
society and experience, [and are
iirmsl that it is an important ele-
ment of a liberal education and is
committed to supporting its cons
tinued development,"

Here at Grinnell we iind a con-
tradiction in the college's policy
due to the existence oi a Women's
Studies chair but no basic and
essential Women’s Studies
courses. A Women's history course
would be a preliminary step in the
development oi Women's Studies
at Grinnell; uniortunately. as the
administration has made ap-
parent, one will not be oiiered dur
ing the next academic year. This
decision will be detrimental to im-
thering the education oi Grinnell
students. ior Women's studies is
the study oi 51 percent oi the
population of this world and is
necessary ior a wellrrounded
liberal arts education. We are not
asking ior radical change but
assimilation with other academic
communities. We are asking for
the addition oi one protessor or the
rehiring oi the current proicssor oi
Women's History ior the upcoming
academic year. _ The memhers
