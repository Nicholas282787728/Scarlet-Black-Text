Breathless '

by Kate Worster

This week the foreign film series
presents Jeaanuc Godard's first film and
one of the most important films of its
period because of its innovative style.

"Breathless" stars Jeaanaul Belmondo
as Michel Poiccard and .lean Seberg plays
Patricia Franchini. Audiences will
recognize Seberg, an American actress,
from films such as “The Mouse That
Roared”, “Paint Your Wagon”, and “Air
port".

The storyline follows the adventures of a
small time gangster, Poicarrd, who steals
a car, finds a gun. kills a cop, then seeks
sanctuary in the bed of his American
girlfriend, Franchini.

The film 15 not noted for its story, but ior
the changes in standard film production
that Godard initiates, For example, the
characters' actions do not coincide with
classical ideas of motivation. Godard
wanted spontaneity in die iilm and en-
couraged the actors and actresses to im-
provise with the dialogue

Godard filmed most of “Breathless"
with a hand-held camera which increased
the camera mobility The streets and
apartments of Paris are the naturalistic
setting for the film Many of the shots are
yoined with quick jumps and are overex-
posed or hazy,

fessor Dudley Andrew as its Roberts Lec-
turer {or this year, Professor Andrew,

popular animated parable about pre-
judice".

great combination of murder, mystery.

riors in the seventeenth century, who were
not allowed to carry weapons, became
monks in the Fuke sect and carried the
shakuhachi flute not only as a musical in~
strument, but also as a iorm oi protection
because of the flute's Club-like ap-
pearance.

1970. He returned to Japan in 1971 and re
mained there nearly seven years while stu~
dying the shakuhachi. Lee became a stu-
dent of Chikuho Sakail l1 and in 1972 he
won the “most promising student award”
of the Chikuho sect of shakuhachi

be awarded the “dai Shihan" (grand
master) rank in shakuhachi. Since then, he
