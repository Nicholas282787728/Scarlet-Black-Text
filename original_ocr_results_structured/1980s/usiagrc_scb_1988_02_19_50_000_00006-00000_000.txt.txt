Library Plans Irk Student

To the Editor:

Since coming to Griniiell, l have
on many occasions come close to
submitting to the S and B all my
petty gripes about this school,
Everything trom the lood to the
phones tmore otten the room has,
in some way or another, pissed me
on. Up until now my complaints
have never really been worthy of
printing. The proverbial straw,
however. has broken the camel's
back.

it appears that the library is
planning to computerize the card
catalog, While l'ni sure this step
will meet with rave reviews in
Rolling Stone and other journals of
higher education. I fail to See Why
it is worth spending halt a million
dollars. Granted, a trustee pros
bably wouldn't bother to pick up
such a small sum it she/he passed
it on the street. but for plain folks
like me, il appears to be a big
waste 0! money

Last semester 1 read of the
library's plan to discontinue some
periodicals because they were over
budget, At the time I thought it
strange that a collegc which con
tinually reminds the world Just
how much money it has was plann-
ing to cut its Journal collection.
Was it the Crash? Is a small
library more ellicicnl" Does
Oberlin have a small periodical

section, too? Now I realize the col-
lege was just savtng up for a new
campus toy, How impressive a
computerized card catalog will
look to the average prospective.
It's really stupid to keep old jour-
nals around 1 mean, when you
came to Visit Grinnell, did you ask
if they had the latest issue of
Schizophrenia Bulletin or The Ans
tarctic Journal of the United
States? Tour guides will have to be
extremely cautious, however. We
wouldn't Want these potential Grin»
nellians actually using this new bit
or hardware, Lord knows, they
might discover that most books
in Burling were written beldre
their ancestors made it to Ellis
island

Last week I was In the library do»
ing some preliminary research tor
a sociology paper, The basic topic
was going to have something to do
with education in Britain, To my
delight there was a multitude of
books in the card catalog on this
very subject As lscanned through
the holidays, however. I noticed
that a large portion of them were
written in the 19th century. 1
became even more distressed
when I realized that many of the
books on "modern" British educa-
tion were published prior to my
birth. what the hell is going on? l

Scarlet and Black

leel a duty now to tell every pros
spective i see that our library may
be very comtortable, but that all
there is to do in it is sleep because
there's nothing good to read.

it the computerized card catalog
is accompanied by a massive new
acquisitions program, that would
be great, and it also wouldn't hurt
the acoustics on the lourth floor.
I'm alraid that this probably will
not happen The trustees, in their
intinite generosity, will allow tor
the addition of something like two
or three more books The computer
cata’log will only be good tor one
thing: saving time. Grinnell
students will no longer spend hours
ﬁnding out that they Will have to
use inter-library loan. The come
puter will tell them in seconds.

While I'm sure ihc planned Com~
puterized card catalog will come
with some extremely comtortable
chairs, I can‘t see wasting $500,000.
That seems like enough money to
buy about 10.000 or more new
books tsliglitly tewcr ll purchased
at the hookstorel. It the college
really wants to buy a nice new
computer system. they should pur~
chase the University ol iowa's card
catalog At least that might be
useful 7 James l., ltoiulros. 'sui

Students Suggest Low-Key

Athletics

To the Editor:

Recent S and BS have contained
letters from athletes who feel the
campus community discriminatcs
againsl them. To assume. n his
rlivlduals. that athletic ability is in-
versely proportionate to iii»
telligence is a lorm ol prejudice
However. an indifference to
athletics in' general is not
necessarily wrong.

Prospectives notice the indifr
ierence towards athletics at Grins
nell. When we were prospectives,
we heard students bragging about
the lootball team's losing record.
Some ol us came trom high schools
that overcmphasized athletics. to

the point ol equating "school
spirit" with enthusiasm towards
the lootball and basketball teams.
Thus. the lack or support or
athletics was a welcome change.
Student athletes should have (ores
seen this indillerence at Grinnell
As prospectives. we were told oi
the lowrkey nature of athletic par»
ticipation at Grinncll. Unfortunate
ly. the athletic teams now take
themselves lar too seriously A
good example is the humorous ans
preach that Grant Ehrlich took in
reporting about the cross-country
team last semester Grant made

Ward Chair Defends
Students’ Caucus

Behavior

To the Editor:

I would like to take Issue with
Eben Erhard's letter that is titled
"Students Demean the Caucus " I
strongly disagree.

Yes, they did make the operation
of the caucus more difficult. We
had anticipated a maximum ol
about 400 persons and when the
counting ended we had 609. As
many or those were new voters it
did take longer to register them,
However. people irequently stand
in much longer lines to attend a
concert.

The caucus was run according to
the appropriate rules oi order and
the tact that we changed the agenr
da was practical, not due to the
students it is commonly done
when there is a large turnout ol
voters

it is also a fact that presidential
politics attracts voters. whether
this is the "ideal" or not is another
issue, in on years the caucus is
lucky to get do people. a reasonable
percentage or these are students
In the same way. a reasonable
percentage ol students remained
tor the tinal plaitorm discussions
alter the presidential subcaucus.

I would also take issue \iith Mr
Erhard‘s analysis oi the informa-
tion level (it the student Voters. I
would sincerely doubt that the non
students were better inlnrmed
about the candidates,

Finallv. I have little 5 mpathi‘

tor Mr. Gephardt's supporters,

They were a distinct minoritv or
those present tzo out ol 609). They
were never denounced or yeered.
They and the other nonviable subs
caucuses were treated lairly and
with respect. Sometimes the other
candidate wins

There is no doubt that the
students do have an impact on
Ward 1. However. that is their
right 7 and not their privilege in
addition, Ward 1 is a more liberal
precinct than the rest ol Grinnell 7
and it would be even if the students
were iic included Individual
precincts seldom rellect the stale
as a whole but. in fact, are skewed,

l lind it hard to discuss Mr.
Erhard's comment on the raucous
behavior ol the group. Yes. there
was cheering and a high level of
noise. The national conventions
are much worse' Iii tact, the
behavior oi single-issue voters is
much Worse. Basically this was an
orderly. responsive. and good
group ol voters

whether Mr. Erliai-d's analysis
is based on a romanticized concept
or democracy or an elitist perspecs
live i can not ascertain. The real
world of politics has seldom been
the place for quiet. reasoned

We believe the status quo at-

These ideas hold that athlctic

Reader Commends Lohaus

I'd just like to commend Bill

church I attended, I replied that I

that I chose not to (chew any

asked me where I would go alter I

convinced, and so assured me. that
