lDear Grin ell Students.

I Alter a tending the Speakeasy

I you know how I feel about being at
IGrinnell. I am proud to be a
lteacher here. When I iirst arrived.
II was concerned about teaching at
Isuch a prestigious college. It had
Ibeen my experience that
I"presl.lgious” meant a Eumcen-
Itric education This may still be
Itrue around the country, but your
Iparticipation in the activities at the
Ilast lew nights was an overwhelm
ling commitment that challenges

Ipersonally thank you all. i thank
lyou as a black woman. parent, in-
lstructor, and as an American.

I want to commend you lot your
|cburage to teach this community in
such a “non-intellectual” form It
took soul. I would also like you to
keep a balance between “your
struggles to lead this community
around the complex questions at
racism,” and completing your
'studles I expect you to graduate. I
expect you to continue being black
and proud and carry on the antr
'i‘acisl tradition within our Afmr
American experience. I salute you.

To the White Students (and all

I ask you to keep a balance bet

Walker responds to
Speakeasy and Forum

To the Editor oltlie s & B,

I was unable to attend Mon
day's “Speakeasy." However, I
did attend VVerluoeray's open
Forum at which students a<lr
dressed issues which had been
discussed at the “Spcakeas "

I was very impressed with the
statements made by most at the
stutlmils who spoke and, in par
lirulnr those made by the Col
lege's black students. I have
been associated with Grinnell‘s
attempts to serve its black stir
dents ior many years. The com.
meuts which I heard irom out
black students Wednesday night
made me very proutl to have
sucli mature and sensible per.
:ons as an integral part or our
r‘omniuuity. I was also proud oi
the openness mid sensitivity to
the problems of the black slu-
tleul; expresaetl by a number ol
the other students who spoke at
the Open Forum.

Dealing with the issues “llicll
result from long-standing ptejir

The “older man in the grey
shirt“ who spoke was Barty Ane
coho. a graduate alsome twenty
years ago. When he said that
‘lte approach and the ideas the
black students presented at both
the “Speakeasy" and the Open
Forum were much more tenr
pared anti ell'ertive than would
have been the case twenty ycats
ago. he was oneltumltetl per-
ceut tight. I believe that
through their sensitivity and [9A
hectiveness represented by the
statements they made at the
“Speakeasy" and the open For

non-black students have shown
us that we may be at a level of
preparedness to understand and
an apparent willingness to work
toward breaking down prejudice

at Gr‘iimell that we never have
reached before.

I thank the black students for
the work \ililcli they put into
