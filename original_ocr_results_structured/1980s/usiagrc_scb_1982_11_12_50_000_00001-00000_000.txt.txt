Wall traces curriculum changes

by John Hanson

As the removal or dress codes, the in
tegration oi North and South Campuses
and the increase in the number or foreign
students all reilect the changing times at
Grinnell, one can also see changes in the
school s curriculum throughout the years
as signs of significant change.

According to Joseph Wall, Rosenfield
professor and director of the Roseniield
Public Affairs Program, Grinnell has kept
in step with the times, moving irom a once
rigid classical curriculum to the present
stage oi increased electives and ilexibility.

“Until the arrival of President George
Gates in the 18805. all students took the
same courses leading towards a classic
liberal arts education. There were simply
no electives." Wall said. Such an education
prepared most students at mat time ior
either the ministry or teaching.

During President Gates‘ tenure the Cole
lege began to emphasize more science and

social scrence courses. At this time
students could begin to choose separate
majors. Under the direction or Protessor
Jesse Macey, Grinnell established the rirst
political science department in the nation
at the turn or the century.

“Before that time, political science was
not considered a separate discipline and
was incorporated within the humanities
areas," Wall stated.

As the number of courses and depart-
ments grew the administration instilled
distribution requirements, and the
sciences were further emphasized at the
college, Also, each student was required to
take two years of a language.

Students no longer had to take one of the
classical languages to graduate, instead
they had their choice of either a modern
language or one of the classics," recalled
Wall.

however, it was easier to just take the
course then study tor an extremely dir-

“I would say in general that the vastmar
jority or students just lorewent the test for
credits and took the course,” he added,

This system or testing for credits was in-
troduced during the term or President

In the late [9505 Grinnell, under Presir
dent Howard Bowen. introduced core
courses. “The college still had various
electives, but every student was required
to take two semesters or a course within
the humanities area and also two
semesters oi a course within the historical
studies area." _

Such a curriculum lasted until 1971 when
the administration under President Glenn
Leggett introduced the current curriculum

guidelines, Required core courses gave
way to the present tutorial system and
limitations were put on the number oi
classes a student might take within his or
her respective field of study. “Such
restrictions would then naturally force'
students to take a wide Variety of
courses,” claimed Wall.

however, according to Wall. “It is possi
ble, unfortunately. under the current
system for a student to graduate from
Grinnell without ever having had a science
class or foreign language,”

Speculating on the future, Wall feels that
there will definitely be some changes con-
cerning curriculum guidelines, although
he is not sure just where the changes might
be made.

Students aid Jordan
in researching Grinnell

by John Hanson

With a $5. 000 grant from the Class oil31,
Professor David Jordan and numerous
Grinnell students have begun the tedious
task of trying to discover the true forms of
student life at Grinnell since its early
years.

“In the past, the focus on history at Grin-
nell has been quite narrow, looking mostly
at the administrations and the buildings
and grounds. What we hope to do is recap~
ture normal student life over the decades
and see why students came here. their imr
pressions and what they all wanted to get
out of a Grinnell education,” pointed Jor-
dan.

in order to begin answering many such
questions, students. under the direction of
Professor Jordan, have been conducting
interviews with Grinnell alumni over the
past two years.

Along with the many interviews, the
researchers are also trying to locate such
items as old diaries and letters. Right now
the group is concentrating on the years
before 1920. between 1920-1930 and the
black alumni. So far, according to Jordan,

the response has been great.

“Grinnell makes a good case study tor
other institutionsaround the country and
many studenB have. or are, working on in
dependent projects themselves to help sup
plement the research being done by the
group as a whole,” Jordan said, He added,
“This is a great way to not only extend the
current archives, but also stimulate stu-
dent research and interest."

In the iuture, Proi. Jordan hopes to
base some history seminars around
various aspects concerning Grinnell’s past
and the project.

Jordan sees no deiinite stopping point
tor the project, but hopes that such an
endeavor will give a much diiierent view
oi Grinnell students over the years than
has been previously given.

”By going back and gathering all this in
tormation, the project hopes to not only see
why a person might have come here, but
also gain a sense or how the student's Grin»
nell years eiiected his/her lite, goals and
values outside or Grinnell College."
