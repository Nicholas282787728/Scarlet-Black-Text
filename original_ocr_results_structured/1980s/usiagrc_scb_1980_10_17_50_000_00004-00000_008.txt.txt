Memory in a Soft October Rain

Through steamy windows

I watch October cry

Her tears falling soft

Into a memory

of one soft October night
Drenched in starshine

And splashed in Autumn gold
As you in a pool of moonlight
Held me close, as close as
Raindrops hug the earth.

I should like to wrile a tamoas
Poem someday; One that “'11 be
Pounded into second grade heads
Am" America.
