At times. it seems as though the
American press creates as many
headlines as it reports: newspapers
iolding due to low readership; publications
being absorbed by other organizations,
such as Gannett; charges of bad repor-
ting; lawsuits filed against yellow-press
tabloids such as the National Enquirer. Is
this situation uniquely American? Not at
all.

Change a few names and one has well
described the current state of affairs of the
French press, according to Michelle Eliot,
who is currently working with the Associa
tion Pour la Promotion et L’Innovation
Sociale.

Although papers in the US. can be
grouped along conservsative and non-
conservative lines, the papers in France

Features

French iournahst battles low pay,
few subscriptions and biased reporting

are very openly divided along political

lines. There are journals, such as Le ‘

Figaro. that are sympathetic to the right:
some, like the Liberation, lean to the left;
and a very tew, one of which is Le Monde,
remain in the middle,

Although there is a single “bank ofinforr
mation” for France (the “AFP”) that
sends and receives telexes, each paper can
interpret and report the news as it sees fit

One problem in France has been the
number of papers being bought up by one
group, HERSANT, which is an organiza-
tion partial to the right. Papers controlled
by HERSAM include Le Figaro and Le
Roi.

Many people, including Eliot, are
distressed by the growing monopoly of the
press, especially since the monopoly’s eta
[acts are not readily apparent. Because

journalists in the HERSANT group are
professionals; “it is dinicult to see”
whether news reporting is biased, Eliot
said, However, she continued, saying,
“The government of die leit made a law to
iorbid the monopoly ol the press recently.

Although there is one
”bank of information” for
France that sends and

receiver telexes, each paper

interprets and reports
the news as it sees fit.

That limits the control of the press,”

Elio noted that the rise in the left-wing
Liberation’s popularity offers another
viewpoint to many people. When it first
came out, “Liberation was of the extreme
left, but it is now more just ‘left,’ " Eliot
said. “At first it was read by the marginal,
[but now it has] greatly attracted the ‘an
ciens’ of the parties of the left. It offers
very strong criticism.

”In 1981, le Matin came out, which was

than the Liberation and is read less by cons

However, not all papers are partisan.
Besides Le Monde, the weekly L’Evene-

Although she attended journalism school
in Paris. Eliot first worked as a part-time,
rather than full-time journalist. In France,
as in the U.S., it is very difficult to earn a
living as a journalist unless one works for
one of the major papers. “I know jour-
nalists who are living almost in misery.”
she said.

Although the French are known for their
love of arguing politics and current af-
fairs, the French journals are facing pro-
