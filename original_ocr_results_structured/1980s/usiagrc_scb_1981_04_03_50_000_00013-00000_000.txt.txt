The Seduction of

The Seduction oi Joe Tynan is just
that: the story at a senator being seduc-
ed and torn by the love tor his lamily,
the desire for power in Washington and
a young, temale lawyer (played adv
mirably by Meryl streepl. It's a good
iilm in a number of ways: it tries to
deal with both the political life of Tynan
(Alan Alda) in the capitol and the lite he
has, or tries to have, with his family in
New York. Aida should be commended
for his script; the female leads (Streep
and Barbara Harris as his wife) are so
well written and so well acted that they
almost overshadow Alda's Tynan,
Tynan is the typical Alda character »
warm, loving, intelligent and honest but
not above tempmtion; here the desires;
are tor politcal power and Streep.

Harris is wonderful as Tynan's wite,‘
trying to manage her career and iamily
with very little help lroni her husband.
Her character is the most sympathetic
in the him, as we easily empathize with
her problems. Seduction more than
adequately presents us with the effects
that being a politician has on one's
home life. hip Tom is good as a
southern senator and Melvyn Douglas
gives a bravura performance as the ag-
ing Senator Birney, We witness some 0!
the dealing and bargaining that goes on
in politics and often wonder if it's worth
it.

All things considered, Seduction is a
good, honest film but a bit overam»
bitious. The obvious complications of a
lite in politics are lully brought out but
we don't see Aida really letting go v
he's reserved, far away. We see how
politics allect his iamily but we get no
real insight into his character. The best
thing about the movie is the perfors
mances r all of the actors are superb
from the smallest part up. It's a rewars
ding [ilm especially because of the ac-
ting. Try not to miss this one. 7 Pamela
