Tremulis to Play Darby

By Andrew Hamilton

Claiming soul music as his great-
est musical passion, Nicholas Tre-
mulis has built up an impressively
diverse repertoire of musical styles

and a band that is at its zenith when .

performing live.

Beginning his musical career on
Chicago’s south side, Tremulis ex-
perimented with the sounds of soul,

Salsa, Latin, punk, rock and jazz. _

Now, with two albums and an im-
pressive string of opening»act dates
to his credit, Tremulis has devel-
oped a style which is not so easily
defined.

On their latest album, More than
the Truth, Tremulis and his band
cultivate a sound which has been
described variously as Funk Pop,
MutantBop,theNewBoogaloo,and
Bad Ass Salsa.

Tremulis has opened for a variety
of musicians, including Eddie Ken-
drick and David Ruffin, and Tina
Tumert He and his band have con-
cen dates with such namesas U840,
Nona Hendryx. Grandmaster Flash
and Shelia E.

Tremulis and his band will be
bringing their eclectic style to Darby
Gym this Saturday night at 9:30.
And if there's any question about the
band's ability to perform well live,
Tremulis put that to rest when he
said with respect to the band‘s tour,
“We are at our best live, and we
intend to play our asses of t"

 

Review: Adam West, the ‘Real’Batman

By Chris Snyder

The 1960‘s television series Batv
man is deﬁnitely one of the more
unusual programs ever to hit the air.
With bright colors, wild camera
angles and a dialogue that leads you
to believe that the writers were on
acid, it gives the impression of a
poorly produced, underbudgeted
attempt at children‘s television.

The truth, however, is just the
opposite, according to actor Adam
West, who played the famous caped
crusader. A large group of students
turned out Saturday night in the
Roberts Theatre to see the original
Batman movie and to hear Westtalk
abouthislifebefore,duringandafter
Batman.

The series, which he claims was
“overproduced” until the final sea
son, actually cost Paramount Stu-
dios a lot more money than people
think. Regular stars on the show
included Burgess Meredith (the
Penguin) and Caesar Romero (the
Joker), as well as other big names.

Many of the special effects and
props, though designed to look
chintzy, were actually fairly elabo-
rate. Aside from the usual “Bat"
paraphernalia, such as the Batmor
bile, Batcopter. Batcave and Eat
Navigational Aid Computer, there
was also a host of gadgets for the
variousvillains toputuptheirsleeves
(or umbrellas). Add to this the ex-
pensive matting process that pro-
duced the infamous banspows, and
kerplooshes that splashed all over
the screen whenever the dynamic
duo sockod it to the bad guys, and it
isn’t hard to realize why the show
used up such a large budget,

Of course, it is hard to convince
yourself of this as you watch Bat-
man, especially when you see the
feature-length movie that they made
as a pilot for the TV series.

One of the first scenes has West,
hanging from a helicopter, being

attacked by avcry large, vcry plastic
explosive shark. Ofcourse, Robin is
able to quickly locate the clearly
marked Bat Shark Repellent in the
copier and climb down the Bat Ladv
dcr to save his mentor in the nick of
time. Holy seafood!

The movie is one oflhc most zany
and hilarious action adventures ever
made, ranking rightup there with the
70’s classic Attack ofthe Killer To-
matoes. The action, sight gags. puns
and the wry humorjust don’t quit.

In fact, it’s funny just to watch
Butt Ward, in his acting debut as
Robin,and Westtry tokeepastraight
face through lines like “Remember,
Robin, just because they drink
doesn‘t mean they’re not human."

“Batman was written on several
different levels,” explained West
after the show. “We wanted you to
see one thing as a six-year-old and
then as you grew up, to see different
things." In fact, a lot of the moral
lessons written into the show, such
as the repeated shots of the duo fas-
tening their seatvbelts, seem down»
right silly to adults.

Other lessons derive their side-
splitting appeal from deadpan deliv»
ery. West recalls a scene in which
Robin, having just been saved by

clamping his jaws down on the Bat
Boomerang and being pulled to
safety, says something like “Holy
denture cream, that was close!" to
which Batman answers, “You see,
Robin — the benefits of good dental
hygiene”

While many students enjoyed the
movie and some of West’s remem-
brances of the cast and set, some
took offense at the blatant sexism,
not only in the show itself, but in
today’s Adam West.

“He offended me," said junior
Erica Krousc. “You think Bau-nan’s
going to be on your side.“

When students asked West about
the sexism in the series g in which,
forexample, Catwoman’soutﬁtwas
so tight that it had to be sewn on a
hereplie/d,“ldidn’treally thinkabout
it We were sobusyconcenuating on
the show that we didn’t see it."

Also, when asked what his favor-
ite Bat Thing was. West replied,
“Bat Girl."

Freshman Karen Kolbe also had
“preconceived notions" about Bat-
man’s having superhero perfection.
“He made some comments which
didn’t seem necessary,” Kolbe said.
“He seemed very put on, He was a
good performer, though."
