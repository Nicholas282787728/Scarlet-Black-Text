' No more
ersonals?

That’s right — no more personals, no more movie reviews, no more a
lot of things, namely the Scarlet and Black. Presently this is no one to
edit the paper next semester. No editor, no paper 7 it’s just that sim-
ple.

There is a pronounced lack of interest or concern (dare we label it in
difference) for the 5&3 on this campus. It is a shame that a campus
supposedly full of bright young students cannot produce more than a
handful of people to put out a paper.

Could this dearth of people to work be caused by the long hours and
low wages'.7 Maybe, but those people who join the staff do so because
they like it. Besides the money is no more than a token amount most of
us would eagerly trade for academic credit.

Could it be the lack of administrative support? Well that might have a
little more to do with the problem. For being an institution that has been
harping of late about its image, this school does little to ensure the
health of its media.

An obvious partial remedy comes in the form of academic credit. Ad-
mittedly the granting of academic credit no more guarantees a quality
paper than it does a winning football team (whose members each
receive credit). But we believe that academic credit c0uld help create a
more dedicated, motivated and ultimately qualified staff . Further, it
would work towards bringing some sort of continuity to the staff from
year to year (or even semester to semester for a change).

Another reason for the present problem lies in student attitudes. The
S&B just six or eight years ago was a fine, award-winning paper. The
writing quality was excellent, the articles were interesting, and the en-
thusiasm with which the paper was produced shone through. Since the
structure of the paper has not changed since then, the change in quality
must be attributed to the quality of the student writing ( or not writing).

It is possible that this previous pride in the paper, in fact in anything,
has been supplanted by an allrencompassing self-interest which does
not allow the student to see beyond the textbook or the beer mug to
realize the value and importance of a student-run paper on this campus.

This self-interest, which can also be seen as a form of indifference, is
the same sort of detrimental force causing the ineffectiveness of the
SGA, now a laughably bureaucratic and powerless rubber stamp
organization. The SGA technically has the means to be more than a ser-
vice bureau, to be a force in the campus community and to be heard by
the administration. But because of the varied quality of leadership and
amount of support over the years, those useful means have been lost. It
is this type of attitude that has put the 5&8 in its sad state.

It really should not be too much to ask students at this “progressive .

liberal arts college” to be concerned about preserving a forum for stu-
dent opinion, a disseminator of campus news and a theoretical ‘voice of
the people.’ ,

The first editorial this staff ever wrote claimed that, “The media are
dying a slow death at Grinnell” (12/ 3/ 32) . People accused us of reacting
incorrectly. Well maybe we were wrong — the dying did not take as
long as we thought it would.

The KGB and me

Steve Burnet

In honor or Georgi Arbatov's upcoming
visit, I thought I would tell the story of
when i met a KGB agent.

In Vienna. there is a bookstore called
the International Bookstore, which is run
by the KGB. A friend and I went in one
time to check it out, and my friend ended
up buying a couple or Lenin posters as
souvenirs Here's what happened:

Clerk: texhihiting his exemplary spy
training) Are you from America?

Friend: tsomewhai wary) Yes.

clerk: Are you going to take these
posters back to the States?

Friend. Well, yes,

Clerk: what are you going to do wtth
them?

Friend: I was planning on givmg them to
a couple of friends of mine.

Clerk: Do you know what they will do
with them?

Friend: Well, one teaches a class in
Marxist Economics, and he'll probably put
it up in his classroom

Clerk: oh, they will be used for educa~
tional purposes. I give them to you ior half
price. ,

I felt sorry tor that guy. i imagined him
spending years studying German, English,
French and who knows what other
languages, going to spy school, working
hard until he iinally got an assignment in
Vienna, the spy capital of the world. He
probably had Visions of stealing advanced
technology and state secrets, And what
does he do? He sells books. And that means

he'll never get to be a spy bet
everyone knows he's KGB. Ever
Even American college students

He has to put up With sma

the writings of other dissidents. He ll
put up with West European and Arne
tourists who think they can "turn"
with the stupendously overwhelming t
ment, "Well what about Hungary in
and Czechoslovakia, 1968?" Even W
he has to put up with Dr. Barucl/‘l
probably the world's foremost authori
Soviet propaganda. Dr, Hazan does
of his research there.

But this clerk endures it all, doing hi
the best he knows how. But I'll bet h
gets a pang of regret when somethin
goes down.

Like in 1977. It seems there was thi
working for both the U.S. and the Sm.
The U S. knew he was a double agen
didn't know it the Soviets knew Tl
why the CIA became worried when
double agent received an order to lne
Soviet case officer in a couple of wee
the Votiv Kil‘che, a famous church in

Vienna followed for those two w.
Every soviet and East European spy
accounted for. When the meeting
came, every entrance and exit of the
Kirche was well covered.

The CIA watched him go in. They'r
waiting for hiin to come out.

If you missed Professor John Seal‘le's
lectures earlier this week, you really miss
ed something. Not only is Professor Seai'le
an entertaining and articulate speaker,
but he had something to say, too

As an active professor oi philosophy at
Berkeley, he is up to date on all the rele-
vant issues in contemporary philosophy.
And it you’re one of those people who think
relevance and philosophy are mutually er
elusive, that’s all the more reason to have
seen him. His main lecture on Monday
night was entitled ~ inds, Brains and
Computers.” and he spoke on other arr
tlticial intelligence (AI) issues in two
classes and in a panel in South Lounge.

There are a number of philosophical
issues involved in the so-called science of
AI, and if you don’t believe that these
issues are relevant, have a look around.
Computers are everywhere and multiply-
ing (I don’t meancalculating) like rabbits.
There are people in the field of AI who say
that within our lifetimes computers will do
everything that people can do and more,
only faster and better. As one researcher
put it, “By the year 2000 we'll have com—
puters so sophisticated that we'll be lucky
if they're wi mg to keep us around as
household pets." Ever wonder how a comr
putcr would treat a dog? Mr. Searle
doan't buy it, but it's worth knowing why.
And don‘t laugh, a lot of people who knowa
lot about Al believe it.
