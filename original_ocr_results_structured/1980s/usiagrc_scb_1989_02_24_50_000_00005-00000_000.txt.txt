Students are losers
in rushed elections

The upcoming Student Government Association presidential/vice-
presidential elections are among the most important events that take
place on campus. This year, however, those organizing the elections
have not demonstrated that they understand and respect the importance
of fully informing both the candidates and the voters.

At the Wednesday, Feb. 15 meeting of Joint Board, dorm senators
were informed about imponant dates for SGA chCtiOnS, A mandatory
meeting for all those interested in runiling for preSidcnt or viccr
president was Sunday, Feb. 19, and the deadline for statements of
intent was Monday, Feb. 20. Elections were announced for
Wednesday, March 1,

Two weeks is not enough Lime either for the candidates or for the
rest of the student body to prepare for the election, At the SGA
meeting, Lia Kohlcs, administrative coordinator, explained that
elections had to be held by the first week in March, and that therefore
the rushed elections were necessary.

Why did Election Board wait until two weeks before the election
deadline to announce the schedule to Saint Botutl'! Some information
was included in the Campw Memo, but senators’ notes are important
sources of campus information, and senators were not given a early
enough opportunity to notify their constituents about the schedule, for
signs publi 'zing the candidacy deadlines were not given to senators
until tlte Feb. 15 meeting. This is inexcusable.

How many qualified applicants missed the deadlines because they
were never completely informed about elections? At most, even ifa
potential candidate saw the Memo, he or she only would have had less
than a week to prepare a statement of intent, as well as organize a
campaign.

In future years, Election Board must provide ample opportunity for
students to participate in the elections, whether as candidates or as
informed voters.

ARLET AND BLACK

Chai responds to

criticism of article

To the editor.

I would like to respond to a
letter written by Sylvain Boko
and Tandcka Stanbaek criticizing
my article of Feb. 3 that
examined the student
demonstrations that took place in
Nanjing, China, last semester.

To say that the anti-Semitism
of the majority of the German
people was the sole cause of the
Holocaust would be inaccurate.
One must take into account the
political, social, and cultural
factors that enabled Adolf Hitler
to -use anti-Semitism as the
rallying point of his Third Reich.
To say that the Nanjing
demonstrations occurred because
the Chinese in the mobs “simply
cannot stand darkrskinncd people"
would be similarly inaccurate.

I agree that racism was a
major factor in the Nanjing
demonstrations. I think I
adequately expressed this in my
article of Ian. 27 that described
the day»by-day progression of the
demonstrations. However,
racism was not the sole cause of
the demonstrations.

The role of the rcsenuncnt of
the Chinese towards foreign
privileges cannot be discounted.
A lot of the students were
demonstrating because they
thought a Chinese security guard
had been killed. They felt that
being privileged foreign students
who were immune to many
Chinese rules, the Africans who
had “killed” the guard would not
be punished. By Dec. 27. the
demonstrators had changed their
slogans from anti-African to anti-
government and anti-foreign
privileges. Therefore, one cannot
say all the demonstrators were
simply giving vent to their racist
feelings.

Contrary to what the letter
asserts, culture clash did also fuel
the demonstrations. My
statement that the African male
students placed a more overt
emphasis on sex than did the
Chinese I encountered is not
racist or sexist. It is a cultural
fact. Western men are much the
same; it’s our culture.

In Nanjing, this type of clmh
in norms between the Westerners
and the Chinese was not as
evident for several reasons. First
of all, both men and women from
Western nations live together in
the dorms so that fewer Western
men are looking to date Chinese
women. Secondly, the
Westerners are usually there for a
few months to two years
maximum. Because of the
greater turnover rate, the students
are less organized and never
developed the weekly institution
to meet women as did the He Hai
University African students. who
live and Study in China for four
to six years.

The He Hai weekly dance
party became known throughout
Nanjing as a place where men
went to pick up women. To
Chinese society, which may
seem sexually repressed to many
Western and African foreign
students, as a dating culture is
only now beginning to form, the
dances were much more offensive
than we might view them. I
want to emphasize that I am not
blaming the African students for
the clash nor do I blame thcln for
the living arrangements that led
to the development of the dance.
If the living situations were
reversed, so that Westem males
had instigated the dance, I believe
a similar cultural clash between

the Westerners and the Chinese
would have occurred.

In addition to the clash in
culture values, the dance also
reinforced the racist stereotypes
held by many of the Chinese.
Because one of the African
student communities was re»
sponsible for instigating and
perpetuating the dances at I-le
Hai, many Chinese, who did not
view the Africans as individuals,
associated all the African studean
with the dance. As a result of
this association, the Africans
became symbols of this clash in
social mores whereas the Eu-
ropeans and Americans did not.

Mr. Boko and Ms. Stanbaek
were correct to point out that
most Chinese do not approve of
the idea of a black man dating a
Chinese woman. This racist
attitude was compounded by the
clash in cultural values and
traditions, and the culture clash
was compounded by Lhc racist
attitudes.

However, I do not think that
this one factor, racism. can be
isolated from all the other
tensions. Culture clash,
resentment of foreign privileges,
political tensions (distrust in the
Chinese govemment), and racist
sentiment came together in
December. This combination of
tensions is what sparked the
demonstrations and that was what
my article was trying to point
out. Contrary to what Mr. Boko
and Ms. Stanbaek imply, I was
not trying to justify the
demonstrations and blame the
victims of this horrifying event.
but rather I was trying to analyze
why everything suddenly came to
‘a head in Nanjing last December.

SGA treasurer reacts to
Levin's campaign

To the editor.

I am writing in response to
Simon Levin‘s statement of
intent for SGA President.
Specifically, I feel his
characterization of this year‘s
SGA is unfair. In his statement,
Simon asserts that if he were
elected SGA president, he would
change the “attitude" of SGA.
As a Cabinet member who
spends countless hours working
for the student body, I find this
statement insulting. I think I
speak tor the Cabinet when i say
we take a great deal of pride in
our work and attempt to make
SGA as receptive and open to
student opinion as possible. For
example, the Cabinet collcetively
holds around 60 scheduled office
hours per week so students have
the opportunity to approach us
with concerns. The Cabinet has

also used new methods of
communication to increase
dialogue with the students (cg,
open forums, SGA handbook,
use of campus media, etc.).

In addition, Simon says
(sorry, couldn‘t resist) that SGA
does not represent student
concerns to the college. As any
Student Affairs dean could tell
you. the Cabinet has never
hesitated to fight for student
concerns when we feel they are
being ignored. In the past year,
we have addressed concerns
regarding the new student
building, the alcohol policy,
renovation of academic buildings,
adequate Human/Gay Resource
Center funding, parking facilities,
safety issues on campus,
medication at the health center,

filnding for sports clubs, in—
stallation of microwaves in
dorms. . . .Thc list goes on.
Student-govemment work de
mands a great deal of time and
energy, often with little or no
reward. I believe this year‘s
Cabinet is composed of
individuals who are involvcd
because they care about the
crgani aim and the services it
provides. It is for this reason
that I respond to Simon’s
statement. As the election
approaches. the candidates will
make numerous accusations,
claims, assertions. and proposals.
It is your job as voters to
distinguish the truth from the
fiction, the feasible from the
unfcasible, and perhaps most im-
portantiy, the informed from the
misinformed. Joe Lewis
