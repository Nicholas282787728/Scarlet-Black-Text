istory courses tor the past seven years. is
-aying the College this Spring. Therefore.

e‘ History Department is seeking can»
idates to fill his posttion, The literature
osition has not been permanently filled
iritwo years.

What follows is a brief history of Afroe
merican Studies programs at Grinnell,

in mid-60's. the College began to otter
nurses in Afro-American culture. An

[rarAmerican Concentration was
Stablished which encompassed an inter»
is‘ciplinary study of Afro-American and

trican cultures

This new Concentration was intended to
lacate the demands of black students Aer
ording to Vice President Walker, these
tudents argued that Grinnell College
lould have diiticulty attracting black
udents if courses which addressed their
in,cerns were not oiiered.

In the early 70's. the AfrtrAmerican

udies program evolved into a special
onmajor programs and in ‘72. after Black
tudents seized the library. Black Studies
ecarne an interdisiplinary major. But by
.79. Afro-American Studies had again ac-
uired its status as an interdisciplinary
incentration.

The main cause or this change in the pro-
ram was the inability of the college to re

used cutbacks in the courses offered in»

‘le concentration as early as the midr70's
nd is still a problem today.

“The English and history positions are

e keystones to the Airo- American
tudies program- " Walker said “Appoint-
ents oi the Afro American Studies posi-

s have usually, been in these two
-partments because these two disciplines
ive students exposure to a variety of
laws onyAfro-American culture.”

“We have always had difficulties attrace
ng people for this position,” Walker said.
The number of black professionals
vailable in the marketplace today is even
wér than back in the 70’s, It ls particular-

hard for us to attract candidates for the"

sitlon because we have to compete with
e Big Ten schools ” Walker added that
rinnell is not an attractive environment
r these candidates: “1 think that it is
—sier for say. Michigan to attract these
ndidates because there. blacks can have

ell as involve themselves with the white
ltilrc around them."

Assistant Professor Liahna Babeiier.
this year's head of the Afro-American
Studies Committee. said the high rate of
turnover in the Afro-American concentra-
tion “denies the program lull stability.”
She added that despite the low number of
students who fulfill the requirements of
this concentration, "there isfa solid in
terest among students in this field, and the
program becomes central to their
academic experience at Grinnell."

The history and English courses which
form the core of the AirtyAmerican
Studies concentration have always been
complemented by courses on African and
AfrorAmcrican culture in disciplines such
as anthropology. economics. policical
science. and sociology. “The study at
African culture combined with Atro-
American studies gives students in this
concentration a broader perspective oi the
rich cultural helitage which blacks
brought to this country with them
Babener said,

According to Professor Sandy Mottet. a
member of the Afro-American Studies
Committee» the variety of courses on Afror
American culture in all of the disciplines
fluctuates because the number of faculty
with expertise in AircrAmerican issues
changes from year to year.
