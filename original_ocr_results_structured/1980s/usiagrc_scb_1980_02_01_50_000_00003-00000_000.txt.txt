Project houses Visited

Have you ever wondered what goes on in those mysterious
houses along Park and East Streets? Who lives there and how
did those people get there? This week we take you inside these
enigmatic project and co-op houses and tell you how you can
become a resident, It‘s an arduous process, but off-campus life
can be worth the effort.

Also this week, we feature a story about the town meeting on
draft registration. A letter by Rick Caplan and our editorial
both address the issue of whether or not we should go ‘Over
There.‘

Two final items. We will occasionally run short poems or
small line drawings in the 8&8. Submissions should be dropped
in the 5&3 box in the post office (faculty boxes). We love mail:
send your cards and letters to our box and please have them
double-space typed on plain paper. Muchas gracias.
