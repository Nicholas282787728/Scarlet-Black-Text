The Skip Day that wasn’t

The SGA officials claim to be concerned with the demise of
Skip Day, but by declaring Skip Day last Friday they moved it
one step closer to extinction. Skip Day is supposedly a day on
which one can disregard studies, avoid the classrooms, and just
take a day off. SGA’s job is to plan to make this day possible.
Last week, many people obviously felt that Friday exams and
impending exams this week did not make the day a good one on
which to skip class. As one student remarked, “It was pretty
quiet down there (the Skip Day festivities on South Campus) un-
til classes let out, then things picked up a little.”

A second point to be made is that Skip Day loses a lot of its
meaning by being scheduled when it was (a week before fall
break). If one is going to take a day off, that day should
preferably be somewhat further removed from a major break.
Of course, it should be noted that the day couldn‘t be held until
the faculty had voted on the Skip Day resolution, a measure by
which SGA agreed to call no Skip Day in the fall if the faculty
would agree to a sanctioned Skip Day in the spring. Unfor-
tunately, the faculty rejected this measure at their meeting on
Monday, Oct. 6. The point in the semester at which Skip Day
would have been appropriate had already passed, but a Skip
Day was held anyway.

It has been reported that some faculty members opposed the
Skip Day resolution because they felt that is was presented in
the form of a threat. By holding Skip Day almost immediately
after faculty rejection of the resolution, despite the fact that it
was clearly a poor time to do so, SGA only presented an image
of students as spoiled children saying, “Give us one or we’ll
take two," and have lowered the credibility of the Skip Day
resolution being offered as an honest compromise.

The concept of Skip Day is a good one. A break is occasionally
needed, and many students aren’t going to leave their studies
for a day without coaxing and community support. However,
when a Skip Day is called it should be for the student body, and
at a time when the majority can enjoy it.
