While waiting for the elevator one day, a
-ood three hours out oi any eight hour

ork day was spent waiting for a very
emperamental elevator, a carpenter with
emarkable powers of observation noticed
was reading a book. Curious. he ventured
nto uncharted territories and spoke: “Is
hat a {”k book?" After a short but wholly
ppropriate glare, he pressed the issue:
‘Well, is it?" Resolved to Wrestle the bull
y the horns. and in my best hyper

nglish~0x£ordian manner, 1 met the
halleng : “It is The Doors at Preception
.y Aldous Huxley."

Without a quiver or a blink, I glared at
he poor man until we got off at our respec-
ive floors. Because of his interest, and the
ernxed pin-ups in the men's room,
Ierhaps a new collection Should be started
n the new Burling, The Dink and Whitey

emorial Collection could contain the best

The most gratiiying part oi being in

rinnell over one summer was being able
0 socialize with Grinnelllans in a non-
icademic and nonrtrauma inducing en-
tironment. There were approximately so
tudents stranded here this summer and

ascinating and engaging subculture was

Contrary to Republican rhetoric blam-
ing the colossal deficits on 40 years of
Democratic fiscal mismanagement.
Reagan's blank check tor the pentagon
could push the deficit above the $100 billion
mark, an estimate regarded by many as
too low. Many people see Reagan's refusal
to ferret out the billions lost through fraud
and waste in the defense department’s
budget. not to mention expensive weapons
systems of dubious defense value, as his
growing alienation concerning real na-
tional security and how to control govern
ment spending.

Earlier diis summer. Murray Weiden-
baum resigned as the administration’s
chief of economic advisers. desiring to
return to academic life. Weidenbaum
denied he was leaving the administration
because of any dissatisfaction With the
direction of the Reagan Administration’s
economic program, yethas now joined the
chorus of economists claiming that the
Pentagon’s huge buildup has contributed
to “horrendous deficits” that threaten to
press interest rates backup and stop short
the anticipated economic recovery.

Pam Lalonde and Charlie Briggs. Atter an
evening of Verdi operas, King Crimson's
Beat, good food, Scrabble and enjoyable
conversation, Ellen concluded. “This is
what summer in Grinnell should be
about." My response was that it was unior-
tunate that we had to wait for a summer.
that freer interaction between students
and faculty was inappropriate during an
academic year.

It is impossible to become an actual resi~
dent of Grinnell in one summer or even
four academic years. However. i did
manage to see a little more or the town
than 1 previously had. Cruising in Grinnell
is much like I remember cruising in my
town with the slight exception that in Gr'n-
hell you can cruise in two minutes and in
Tacoma it takes a good hal[ hour to cruise
the main drag once, (And don’tyou lose in
terest after two minutes anyway?) After
you cruise there are [our choices- ll cruise
again, 2) head to ZAPl, 3) hang out at the
parking lot in iront ot Van's Laundromat
(easy access to bathrooms and a decent
sized parking lot makes this a lively
hangout) or it go to the driverin or the
cinema. it was singularly gratitying to
learn, however, that the college students
have as rude a nickname as the “townies”
do: we are "tWIIikB "

One particular incident deserves men-

1 happened upon this document in iront
of a North Campus dormitory (which will

To the Editor. I would like to take this
opportunity to lodge a complaint against
the organizers or New Student Days '32 of
Grinnell College. In my new student
packet of literature and paraphernalia 1
received a button that read “I Survived
New Student Days 82. Grinnell College”
Inherent in this is the presumption that all
new Students would indeed survive New
Student Days, and it is precisely this point
to which I wish to call your attention

Student Days,

On my first day here as an entering
treshman I participated in a studentled
tour of die campus, I became separated
from my group somewhere between the
ARH and the PEG as i stopped to observe
two red squirrels do battle over a chunk of
chocolatethip cookie. Before I knew it, I
was lost and disoriented in rugged terrain
int ~ vicinity oi Eighth and park, For two

a and nights i wandered, cold and
ngry by night. hot and thirsty by day,
toraging ior berries. roots and occasional
small rodents to say alive. on the morn
ing or the third day I was rescued by a
member of the women's fieldrhockey team
when she discovered me while chasing an
errant ball. Thanks to her quick thinking
and the work of the health service staff, I
am alive today.

Let this serve as a warning to those New
Student Days organizers who so tlippantly
assumed the ultimate saiety or their
charges, enough so to commission a button
proclaiming “I Survived New Student
Days '32." i am proud to be the near-
exception to the rule, and otter living testa-
ment to the aiuom that one can never ac»
ciise a new Grinnell student oi mindless
contormity. — Sincerely, Bosart r.
Quigley, ’86.

Having gone through New Student Days
myself. 1 can empathize with Mr. Quigley.
I wonder, though, how many students
would have the courage to write about
such a traumatic and harrowing ex-
perience. Bosart‘ is truly a hero tor the
modern Grinnellian, Here’s to you, Boze . .
