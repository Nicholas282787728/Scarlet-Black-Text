Banister. llulllnan owe
Grinnell an analogy

Des Moines Register reporter Robert Hullihan was welcomed to cam-
pus last weekend to observe the Grinnell Relays for an article in Mon-
day’s Register. Unfortunately, Hullihan apparently arrived with a chip
on his shoulder and turned a supposedly humorous article about a'
humorous event into an attack on the college community. The Register
allowed Hullihan to misrepresent the relays as well as the college.

Hullihan brought up several points totally unrelated to the relays and
clearly contemptous of the Grinnell student body. “Wearisomely
bright” doernot describe the student 1population here. No term does
One of the most attractive aspects of t e college is its diverse student
body, yet, Hullihan-reduced us to‘an inaccurate‘stereo 10f ‘v‘g'ypsies”
who insist'on making “significant comments aroun the campfire"
Perhaps Hullihan has something against concern shown by students, Or
perhaps he is merely as confused as his writing st le is, We’re still try-
ing to figure out the significance of some of the th ngs he said But then
again, we can’t even see the symbolism inherent in the obstacle course.

It’s a shame that a professional reporter can’t come to a school like
Grinnell and see past t ings like hair on the legs of some women. Not on»
1y was the issue overstated, it was\also irrelevant, Many women,
though, were offended by this “humorous” look at Grinnell’s fEmales. It
is also untrue that Grinnell protests winning teams. The swimming
teams fill the PEG natatorium with fans and attendance at basketball
games fell off after the team started losing.

BBB Bl'ﬂilllldSl uuesllunell ‘

It was reported at Wednesday night‘s Joint Board meeting that the In-
itiative Fund Committee allocated $50 for last Saturday’s Beer, Bacon
and Beaver Breakfast. According to IFC Chairperson Marilyn Zielinski,
“The decision to give the organizers money for the event was the
hardest one we‘ve had all year” But, she explained, the breakfast met
the guidelines for IFC funding: it benefited at least 20 people and many
peoEle supported it.

T e fact that nearly 60 people attended the earlyamorning gathering at
$5 each proves the interest in the breakfast. But the refusal of the Relays
Committee to support the event financially, as has been its custom in the
past, also proves the opposition to BBB and its disassociation with
Re ays. .

Zielinski made clear to Joint Board members that the SGA money
spent on the event covered only the cost of renting the Eagles Lodge and
did not contribute to the payment of the traditional stripper. The S&B
does not uestion IFC’s good faith in dispensing the money What we do
wonder a out is the campus consensus concerning the event and the
responsibility to the campus community as a whole shown by the sup-
port of this sexist affair.

With the Relays committee sanctioning and supporting the Bloody
Mary and Bagel Breakfast in Younker Hall Lounge and given the sexist
connotations of the event, possibly evidenced by the participation of only
one woman, how necessary was student government support of the
event? We hope the issue will be discussed publicly before another
allocation for the BBB Breakfast can be made from student funds in
planning for Relays XI.

The recent open forum on
authoritarianism at Grinnell was intended
to be an opportunity for the students to exA
press opinions on a rather threatening
issue as well as a chance [or the ad
ministration and the faculty chairman to
discuss their positions and powers.
However, in the first hour President
George Drake, Dean Catherine Frazer,
Dean Waldo Walker, Dean .lim Tederman
and Chairman of the Faculty Morris
Parslow in turn spoke of theirrespective ,
powers and duties and with the exception
of Tcderman, attempted to underestimate
their decision-making powers at the col-
lege. This set the tone for a long, basically
fruitless discussion accentuated by.
vagueness on the part of the administra-
tion and an excess of speciﬁcity on the part
of the students. ,

i find it difficult to believe the ad,
ministration encourages student imput
after listening to two hours of an open
forum laden with euphemisms such as,
“It's under serious consideration," and
“That's a personnel matter," i find it
equally frustrating to listen to studean

To the Editor:

We have recently taken part or a public
demonstration of the power "of nuclei!'
weapons in the employ of nations commit-
ted to the arms race. We have engaged in a
dramatic symbolic act, a sign of the
devastation that could be produced by
principles of paranoid self-interest in the
international community.

What was the meaning of our act?

if what we have done is lay down our
bodies in mock death only to symbolize the
effectiveness of the powers of death, then
we who participated are, of all people.
most to be pltied. Then our sign means on
ly that we were among the first to
recognize our powerlessness and enact our
despair,

Butyif what we have done is a moral act,
a sigief conviction and if what we have
done is symbolically demonstrate our wilt
mess to lath miles in the sewn?
'of a’high‘er principle, a principle of global' '
solidarity, a principle of nonrviolent life,
then we have shown ourselves to be part of
a growing community of hope. Then, our ,
symbolic act of last Thursday may be a,-~_
sign of a moral shift from humanity's age-
old compliance with war-making to the
principles of a new age of global unity and
international peacermaking.

The meaning of our “deaths" on Ground
Zero Day will'be shaped by the partwe are
willing to play in the near future. in the
bright light of an hydrogen explosion the
choice seems clear: shall we die for war or
live for peace? 7 Bob Towner, Episcopal
