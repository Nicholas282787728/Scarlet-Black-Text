dent George Drake, Dean oi Faculty
Catherine Fk‘azer, Executive Vice Presi-
dent Waldo Walker, Chairman of Faculty
Morris Parslow, and Vice President and
Dean Of Student Affairs Jim'Tederman

President brake is the only ads
ministrator who is hired by the Board of
Trustees, He has broad and general power
as laid out in the bylaws oi the college,
However, in the actual running oi the Cole
lege Drake delegates power to the ad-
ministrators who do most of the manage-
ment of the college

Drake listens to recommendations by
me administrators and others on how
everything should be done. Some of
Drake's most important functions have to
to with representing the college to the out»
side world and to alumni and raising
money.

Drake‘s contact with students is through
formal meetings With the SGA president,
and the editor of the Scarlet and Black and
the news director from KDIC

Parslow said that he has mostly duties
and few powers. His job essentially con
sists of being a member of all the faculty
committees, including the Executive
Council. Parslow serves on the sub
committee which interviews candidates
for positions at the college. His inﬂuence is
through his positions on the committees
for which he acm as a liaison to facilitate
communication. Parslow said. “I don't
think that the office of faculty chairman is
the proper route [or communication The
iaculty chairman

interests primarily ' He suggested
students bring their concerns to the presi-
dent, deans or committees,

Frazer's area of responsibility is in
academic concerns. She tries to represent
the iaculty to the community and, when
appropriate, the outside world. She said,
“The story oi my liie is committees "
Through her participation in those come
mittees she can only influence and try to
persuade,

Frazer is the Curriculum Committee
Chairperson but she can vote only in the
case of a tie. She can be reached through
the many committees she is a member of
and of which students are also members.

He directs his staff, although that direc- ,

Walker said, “George described my

however, in an on line, straight.
authoritative manner. We try to hire the
best people that we can to direct the opera-
tions and then we pretty much cut them
loose."

Walker said he is in only one committee
with students, the Admissions Committee,
He suggested that students find out what
the committees are and who is on them in
order to maximize their input

Although he does not have much direct
contact with students because of the
nature of his job. Walker said he welcomes
students into his office.

One student pointed out on the subjectof
Communication with the trustees, that
students “are stockholders in Grinnell Coir
lege at $10,000 an annual share. we
should have some input,“ He asked how
students can better communicate with the
trustees. Drake answered, “There are two
forms of communication that regularly
take place. The scA makes a report to the
Board oi Trustees at every meeting Then
there‘s a board committee called the Come
munity Life Committee and it meets at
each board meeting with a group of
students."

Drake also said that about once each
year there is an open iorum scheduled with
the trustees. There is such a forum
scheduled On the afternoon of May 7 this
year. About onehali the members of the
board will be there, Board members will
also be attending classes and going to
lunch with students at that time. Trustees
are usually willing to go to iniormal events
with students when asked, Drake added,
He went on to say that this board is more
open to communication with students than
most and that “they try and they do care."

When a student asked how much
students' input is taken into account when
matters such as tenure decisions are being
considered, Parslow said student input is
considered “very seriously." Walker adds
ed. “In the last three years the college has
denied tenure to two people and has denied
contract renewal to two people " During
this period the college had considered
many cases, Walker said, “The problem is
that the only things that rear their ugly
heads in a situation like this are Uie

positive cases. . . you are on the winning

side oi a great many of these cases but you
just can't expect to win them all."

Drake was asked whether he did not
allow an appeal in the Assistant Professor
oi Philosophy Dan Magurshak tenure case
On the grounds that are in the faculty hands
book that is, teaching ability, scholarly
work and service to the college. He
responded. “Predominantly, those were
the factors that inﬂuenced my deCiSion
Drake went on to say that the procedures
followed in making the Executive
CounCil's original decision were those
followed in making previous decisions.

Later, when Drake asked about the Per~
sonnel Appeals Board's recommendation
that Magurshak‘s case he reevaluated, he
stated that only one of the four points
brought up by the board was considered by
the members to be a problem. This point
was that the issue of Magurshak's position
within the department “shouldn't have
been brought up at the level of the EX-
ecutive Council,” said Drake he Conn
tinued, “That sort of consideration has
been a part of the Executive Council cons
sideration in every tenure Case" since he
had been a nonrvotingmemberof the coun-
Cil.

When asked if Existentialism and
phenomenology tareas in which Magure
shak is qualified and which are part of his
job description) had been removed from
the Grinnell College curriculum, Drake
answered, “Not to my knowledge." Finals
1y, he said that he did not allow Magurr
shak's appeal because, “In my judgement
there were not sufficient grounds for the
appeal."

Walker was asked to comment about the
change in the admissions policy toward
limiting the number of students who need
large amounts of financial aid in the cons
text of an increase in tuition which was
supposed to insure that need blind admis-
sions policy was to be maintained. Walker
said the change in policy and the increase
in tuition were both needed to make up for
underestimates of costs in past years.

years at the college," Walker said, “One is
that l have underestimated three. lour and
iive years ago what inilation was going to
be 7 number one. what our competition
was going to do, 7 number two. And
number three 7 I underestimated what we
should charge in our comprehensive ice to
make it possible ior us to cover the propor-
tion of the cost of education at the college
by our student tuition and fees revenues
That means during that period oi time i
undershot."

Another student raised the question oi
whether the administration had followed
its own policy when student Melinda
Hunt's computer mail me was searched
shortly beiore the iirings oi Dave Renaud
and Mark Grundler in Computer Services
Walker said the search was legal and
authorized properly by Director oi
Academic Computing Tom Moberg. He
went on to say, though. that the policy cons
cerning computer mail tiles needs revision
and that “The college has simply been
holding off for five months In reevaluating
a great share oi its policies — this being
one of them —- in regard to computer
policies. computer related policies, until
we have a new director on deck; and we
plan to do a complete housecleaning "

Walker later said, in response to a ques
tion on how closely the administration
ioliows the policies it sets up. "i know oi no
policies that have been violated. they are
interpretive decisions and Judgement
calls." He also pointed out that the presr
dent is ultimately responsible for those
judgement calls.

in answer to student‘s desires tor a
clearer sense oi what the trustees and ad»
ministration plan ior the iuture. Drake
said, “A! the last Board oi Trustees
meeting, we began talking about a long
range plan ior Grinneil College 7 the need
ior one. So it isn't just the studentswho ieel
that way; it's the trustees." When the pro
cess oi making such a plan is started next
year it will be a “representative process."
Drake said.
