The Fun Chart
You must...
have nothing to drink

have a couple of beers
go‘to a bar and drink
quite a bit

visit a lot of bars and
get drunk

get so drunk you throw
up ior five straight
hours

get so blasted that you
wake up 50 miles from
the last place you were
at before you lost your
memory
The great thing about this chart is that it
orks in reverse, too.

If I could walk that way

It‘s a distinct pleasure to be with you
once agai Most of you. My employer, the
Competition, has graciously consented to
give me temporary leave trom duties as
Very important Consultant to svep back in-
to my old slot. of course, I had to agree to
the standard ‘Save all the Good Stuff for
Us‘ clause, so I'm afraid for now you'll just
have to settle for less, But you're used to
thatt

So what's happening? Ari insider has
just informed me that the next few months
will be a period of rapid new college
development. For one thing, we can rest a
lot easier with regard to the threat of
foreign aggression. The Administration,
fearing trouble from south of the border,
has built an lmpregnable bunker atop the
library out or Legos. “Those Argentine
bastards aren't going to seize our Falkners
or any other Southern holdings in Burling
without a fight,” one high Nollen l-iouse
source stated.

The Office of College Relations has an
nounced a plan to bolster student pride and
college public relations in the face of re»
cent claims that the student body Is
disillusioned and that the powers that be
‘aren't getting enough moral libre in their
diet. What the institution needs, it was
decided, is to identify itself with a figure of
respect and inspiration — a personage
symbolic of goals and actions important to
the college, of the type of student one
might see here now and or the New Era of
leadership already blossoming In the
United States. .

And so in coming weeks the campus
community Will become gradually ac-
customed to hearing the name of . . . MOE
— the Patron Three Stooge oi Gnnnell Colv
lege! Moe was chosen because he’s the one
we are all familiar with as “the smart
Stooge" and who will be immediately iden
tified with qualities of intellect, leadership
and thrift. Moe is the liberal-arts Stooge,
equally capable with monkey wrench,
Seltzer-bottle or twdby-four. He exhibits a
critical, questioning mind and is much less
likely than other Stooges to naively take
the word of “authority" at face value, This .
quality is illustrated by his lamous com-
ment, “Oh, a wise-guy, ch?” which will be

instituted as the new Grinnell motto.

Students will be encouraged to wear the
distinctive Moe hair style and special sum»
mer internships as exterminators at socie-
ty parties are being designed by Career
Services.

The final change to be brought in is in the
number draw procedure. instead of simply
drawing a random number to determine
room draw order, each student will be
assigned a number (at random) which will
determine his place in a line for drawing a

- random number which will determine his.

place in line at number draw. To increase
the randomimity of this random pro
cedure, students in the line to draw their
numberdraw-iine number will be chosen
at random to ilio a coin with the person in

back or them. The winner of this random
comatoss will get the position furlhat
ahead in the line or the two, giving him a

opportunity to draw a more random
number, with tewer fingerprints on it,

Also, one number from mch class has
been chosen at random ahead of time to be
next fall's grand prize winner. Johnny, tell
him what he's won!

auto mechanic and David is a six-loot
iaoepound musician. Thor is stocky but has
the mechanical intuition of an amoeba
Nancy is an LSD Saturated leftover from
the early ’70s. (it you see a pattern, letme
know.)

The words gay and straight are a conve-
nience. I can only look into mysell and
realize that they are wrong. Perhaps some
other people will rind their groups to be
synonymous with a sexual group but you
will probably find them only in a mental ine
stitution. A friend of mine who deﬁned
himself as a gay pedophile (he liked little
boys) was considered to be Strange with a
capital 5. A person without the limitation
of youth surely wouldn'tbe allowed to walk
the streets when I can’t even hold the
hands or my lover in public without going
to jail.

I would like to walk away from the words
that i know are wrong but the people in my
group will not let me. They use the convee
niences for what they do not understand.
John Number 1 left Grinnell after one
semester and hasn’t answered any letters
Since. Thor took 0“ two weeks after I told
him, never to return. David cringes at my
very sight and the second John tolerates
my presence but has his girltriend lor
societal protection, Tim calls himseli gay
but lives 1,200 miles away and also sports a
somewhat twisted mind. (For all of you

 

hopefuls, Nancy is married and Betsy will
be there very shortly.) Why do all of these
people panic" what strange power do i
possess? I have thought about ﬂiis. The on-
ly thing that i could possibly do is to make
them cum all over their underwear and
make it all sticky. This does not seem like
a whole hell of a lot to be scared of, actual-
ly, i am certain that modern laundry
technology must have tackled this one by
now.

If there were any one to be Scared of, it
would be society, wielding its psychiatric
conveniences and the power to send me
and lovers to social exile or even to jail,
why do they harass me in the Pub" (or my
friends”) They do not harass me, They
harass the image of me that they hold in
their mind. I have never even spoken to
these people before in my life. I do not
know them and they do not know me.

That still doesn’t answer my question of
why David cringes and Thor splits for all
eternity. If I were not a member of their'
group they would feel nothing for me. As
long as they avoided any situation where
guilt by association might take place, they
should have nothing to fear from society. It
would only be the thought of an actual rela-
tionship that could produce a reeling or
tear in their hearts, I love them and maybe
they are thinking that they could love me.
(I can always hope, can't I?)
