care and are concerned about the horrors
of the apartheid s tem inflicted upon the
citizens of South Africa ' Gurira went on

say a lot about our "guts“ as a college to
take a stand on a moral issue On the ques
tion of the size of the College's investment
in South Alrican companies Gurira sug
gested. "You do not get rid of slavery by
being a slave owner." He urged that Grine
nell be “part of the solution and not the
problem."

After Gurira's remarks the crowd mar-

Dean oi Faculty Frazer and Executive

had hoped to speak with the Trustees
because only one trustee was left: Chaire

Board Decision

Drake oriered to see ii Maytag would
come outside and alter a minute or two the
chairman did appear on the step, One of
the students asked Maytag what the
Trustee decision had been on divestment
He replied that the Board had reaffirmed
its 1973 decision which is against divest-
ment. Later administrative assistant to
the President of the College Helen W.
Wiese said the Board will not release an of-
flClal statement concerning discussions on
South African divestment The trustees
talks will. however. be disclosed to the
iii-iiiiieli Magu‘liue

Maytag explained that the Board had
spent more time on the divestment issue
than any other during its last iew
meetings He told those gathered that "we
don't take your concern lightly " However.
his last statement was that "ifyou want us
to change our minds you will have to cons
Vince us."

After the brief dialogue with the crowd
Maytag went back into the house and
Drake, Frazer and Walker left The
demonstrators also left and marched back

Robbins said the demonstration itself
was an "unqualified success“ He was
pleased with the turnout and thought the
”people who were there were involved."
He noted the number oi people yelling and
carrying signs.

As for the trustee decision to uphold
their 1 ".l standing on divestment Robbins
said. They've , retreated hack to the
position which has allowed them about
nine years oi relative unconcerii on the
issue and we‘re not gouig to let them {all

could be heard. although the words were

Sal Alinsky. a labor/civil rights acthISt oi
the 19605, “The way to deal with WASPs,”
he said of Alinsky‘s theory. "is to yell and

The chanting became louder and hit a
crescendo with the shout. "Grinnell has no
business with bigots'” Maytag turned his

own level Robbins explained the SASG

'had put the burden oi proei on ourselves

we did our homework.“ The group
argued morality and. according to Rob
bins. "showed them enough that we think
we've proved to them the moral issue.”

Robbins said that a previous argument
or the trustees as to why Grinnell should
not divest was that a college should not
take a moral stand Now. though. the
Board members say their job is to see that
Grinnell College makes money They
make no mention oi morals
