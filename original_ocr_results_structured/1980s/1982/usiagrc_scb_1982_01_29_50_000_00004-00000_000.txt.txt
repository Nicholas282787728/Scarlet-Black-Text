Starlet it Black ~ Iannary 29, 1532

Hill al 100:

Take some lime
l0 remember

Tomorrow marks the 100th anniversary of former President Franklin
D, Roosevelt’s birthday. Although no students and perhaps only a
minority of the faculty, administration and staff can personally
remember FDR’s historic reign, we all need to take out a few moments
and realize the impact this one person had on the United States and our
own lives.

An avalanche of FDR memorials have been published recently and
each recounts the successes and failures of his four presidential ad-
ministrations, The articles describe the concern this aristocrat had for
the common people, how he fought polio, the distrust he held of intellec-
tuals and the organization and creativity he showed in his first 100 days
in office. Each also mentions the public relief projects he implemented,
his role in labor union history and the way he was able to pioneer com-
munication with his countrymen through radio.

These articles also recall his manipulation of the press, the schemes
used to blackball his opponents and his attempt to pack the courts. In-
cluded, too, are the possibility that he made concessions to Stalin at the
Yalta Conference of 1945 because of his failing health, the wiretapping of
his meetings and his affair with his wife’s secretary. He also interned
J apanese-Americans, overlooked the Nazis’ war against European
Jews and began the build-up of bureaucracy that now characterizes the
US. government at all levels.

But negative or positive, what Roosevelt accomplished and what he
stood for were radical changes in the United States. FDR introduced die
idea that government should be responsible for the welfare of its
citizens. Implicit in his public relief projects was the premise that each
person is worth caring about. And he provided a hero figure that
Depression-era Americans could put some faith in. Although belief
without action is a dangerous consequence for Americans, not since
John F. Kennedy have they been able to believe in a president long
enough to let his policies survive the cynicism of public opinion polls.

Above all, perhaps, FDR was flexible. He began his first term with a
“Reagonomics” philosophy but revised it once he saw it would not
revitalize the American economy and people. Thus, the New Deal was
born. Ronald Reagan should heed Roosevelt’s advice: “It is common
sense to take a method and try it If it fails, admit it frankly and try
another. But above all, try something,”

Grinnell College played an important role in the FDR era as up to 40
Grinnell graduates worked in his administrations. Five Grinnelliarts
held key positions, including Harry Hopkins, ’12, who served as Com—
missioner of the Works Progress Administration, Secretary of Com—
merce and Special Assistant in World War II.

Grinnell is also playing an important role in allowing the campus com-
munity to remember and celebrate Roosevelt’s presidency. Yesterday’s
Scholars’ Convocation by Richard Lowitt of Iowa State University and
tomorrow‘s talk by, ISU‘s George T. Mchmsey entitled “Hopkins and
Roosevelt” at 2:30 pm. in South Lounge, sponsored by the Rosenfield
Program, are great opportunities to think about FDR’s impact. A
special on FDR will also be shown tonight at 7 pm. on ABC TV stations.
We hope you have and will take advantage of them.

“What do you do

some variation on this theme is the ques-
tion asked a zillion times to each and every
Resrdent Adviser who ever lived To set
the record straight 7 and tor all or you
who have never dared ask a Resident Ad
visor what she/he does all day 7 I’d like to
oircr a "group answcr,"

To answer the question of what our oil
iicinl responsibilities are. I'll quote trom
the announcement written hy the college in
search 0| new KAS.

"Responsibilities include the pen”
sollal. social and academic advising

oi’ approximately 200 students

Administrative and proctoi-ing

i-esponsihilitics are kept to a

minimum. Resident Advisers have

the opportunity to structure the Job
according to the needs oi lhe
students and their own lifestyle con-
siderations. Counseling. advising
hail government, program planning
slall supervisron and informal con
tact with students are significant
aspects or the ion. Additionally.
there are opportunities to work in
the Career Services or Academic

Advising ottices .

So Resident Advisers at Grinnell are
primarily responsible [or the students
within their dorms, Somewhere between 10
and 15 hours per week are spent In what is

 

called the "outside area" 7 Career Ser-
vices, Academic Advising or as Assistant
to the Deans According to the olricial an
noullcemenl, there are several reasons roi-
involving RAs in oueide areas. to gain a
better understandiong oi' the college, in
creascd visibility to iacuity, start and
students. to gain rurthcr pi-oiessional ex
perience. and to spent time outside or the
residence halls

Sometimes orricial pronouncements and
job dcscriptions don't seem to match the
actual job: such is not the case at Grinnell
what you Just read in the paragraph above
is iairly accuratc and wonderiuliy sucA
cinct But we arc lett with the original
question: "Whal do RAS [)0 all day.
anyway""

Meetings, the bane of every protessional
person‘s existence. are no less the bane of
the existence of RAS. Ab‘oul 12 hours a
week are spent in, three different staff
meetings. hall councilgmeetings, group
meetings with SAs, hall and floor
meetings, etc We also are members or at
least two committees or campusavidc im-
port. such as the Housing Committee or
the New Student Days Committee.

Then there are study hreaks, i usually
sponsor one big-bash-Lype study break
regularly plus “The Traveling RA Cookie
