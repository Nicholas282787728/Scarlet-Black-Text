Faculty reprimands SGA

by Ellen Heath

“Strong disapproval” characterizes ma
jority faculty feeling on the recent SGA let-
ter to Dean Catherine Frazer Which asked
for her resignation from one of her two
positions at the college,

After the regular iaculty meeting on
Monday, May 10, Chairman of the Faculty
Morris Parslow called a closed meeting
which only faculty members were allowed
to attend. During ﬂoat session, the faculty
voted to send a resolution to Joint Board
members expressing their disapproval of
the SGA action.

The resolution stated that the faculty
does not object to “the exercise of free
speech by any member of the college com-
munity," but that the SGA overstepped is
bounds in asking Frazer to resign

Five points outlined the faculty’s objec-
tions to the letter. First, the Office of Dean
of the Faculty is concerned with faculty
matters which are not “within the official
purview” of SGA, Second, the resolution
pointed out that it is not uncommon or ims
proper for the dean of faculty to also hold a
iaculty position.

The third point stated that, “This faculty
rejects the implication that members of
any or its committees (voting or ex-officio)
ought not to be iree to express their poms
oi view," Fourth, the faculty pointed out
that according to college bylaws, cur-
riculum is the responsibility of the faculty
and not that of the SGA

The last point noted that participants in

official personnel discussions should be
confident that the discussions are con»
iidential. According to the resolution,
”hearsay reports” are not acceptable
grounds on which to base complaints about
those who participate in the personnel
discussions.

The approval or the resolution was not a
unanimous decision, according to
Parslow. SGA President Elect John Moiiet
and Vice President Elect Mark Bradshaw,
asked to speak at Monday‘s meeting but,
Parslow said, “The meeting had already
gone into executive session when they ask
ed to speak.”

According to Bradshaw, he and Mofiet
wanted to speak to the faculty to make
clear that the present SGA is not the same
as the administration which sent the letter

to Frazer. Bradshaw said they wanted to'

discuss a better working relationship with
the faculty. He added that there is no
necessary continuity from one year to the
next about what the SGA does, aside from
the normal services it provides.

The new SGA had their first meeting
Wednesday night and drafted a letter to
the faculty about the letter the last SGA
sent to Frazer This letter states that the
present SGA is not taking a position at pre»
sent on the letter to Frazer, However, the
sea “would like to reafiirm (its) power to
express student satisfaction or dissatisfaca
tion on any campus issue.”

The letter was passed unanimously.

Norris gets cool air option

by John Houser

This summer the college will have
renovation work done in some of its
buildings to better facilitate their use by
academic, church and business groups ior
conferences and meetings, It will also Con-
tinue to make modifications of buildings in
accordance with the visit by fire marshals
last year in addition to the planned renovar
tions of Cowles and Dibble Halls.

Construction crews have recently been
erecting a small building behind Cowles
Hall which will house a new boiler and air
conditioning equipment. The boiler is
needed so that the Heating Plant will not
have to be started in order for the Physical
Education Complex to have hot water in
the summer, Air conditioning will be in-
stalled in Norris Hall and die dining area
of Cowles. It will be offered as an extra
cost service for groups wanting it in Nor-
n's. Cowles dining hall will be completely
renovated as well,

Modifications to buildings which stemm-
ed from the fire marshal’s visit mostly in-
clude the installation of new doors,
however, after iinishing negotiations with
the fire marshals, it is possible that the Cole
lege will either enclose the open stairwells
in the Science Building or install a positive
pressure system ior the removal of smoke
in the event of a fire.

Executive Vice President of the College
Waldo Walker said that there will be eight

to 10 groups involved in the summer pro-
grams at Grinnell They include a church
conference, a high school football team
which will be coming to practice, a group
of high school teachers which will be learn
ing about computers and a group of in
surance people. ‘He also said that most
groups are expected to be either academic
or business oriented.

Rates charged to groups interested in us
ing the college’s facilities during the sums
mer months will vary depending on such
factors as the size of the group, the ser
vices they require, the duration oi their
stay, whether or not they want air condia
tioning and it they havefood service needs
but Summer Programs Director Jim Work
estimated that the charge per person for
room and board would be between $15.50
and $22.50 per day.

Though the decision to run summer pro
grams was made only at the trustees
meeting last November, Work said that by
next year or the year after the program
should be in full swing, ProfiB are ex-
pected from the program, but the real
value for ﬁle college will be the help to the
college's image. Work said that ”our
primary interest would be in the image of
the college. There are a lot of people who
have heard of Grinnell but have never seen
it." The summer programs will help to
remedy this problem.

Gates golfing for ‘triOuble

by Ann Cody

Damage to Gates Hall has been a pro-
blem all year, according to Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Jim Tedemlan, but the crown-
ing blow was discovered after a party two
weeks ago

Maids found two broken windows When
Physical Plant workers came to repair the
windows they noted numerous golfball

' dents and several putter head imprints on

walls and inside doors of Gates as well as
damaged fire alarms. As a result of these
“driving range" damages in three of the
dorms hallways, Tederman is charging
the hall $550 which must be paid by this
Friday, or Gates residents will be taken to
Judicial Council.

Several students have told Tederman
that they are not responsible for the
semester-long golfing damage and he
agrees many students are getting an
undeserved reputation. Yet he is upset that
uninvolved students have not tried to stop
the year-long assault on the newly-
renovated hall, Before the golfing started
in January, Gates had already paid $175
ior unrelated damages. Repair oi the year

long damage will cost approximately
$1500.

Gates Hall President Joey Walsh said he
called four or five hall meetings in the last
two weeks to try to resolve the problem.
Although all residents have agreed to pay
$7 each, Walsh believes only about half of
the residents were involved, The college
has taken money out oi the continuing
enrollment fees of those students who ad-
mitted their part in the damage.

Walsh feels Tederman came on strong in
an attempt to make a point by using Gates
Hall as an example. One resident, claimr
ing he expressed hall opinion. said that the
damage was so great because the walls
are thin in renovated dorms.

Tederman feels he's on the line over this
issue since, as he told trustees who have
contributed greatly to dorm renovations,
that if residence balls were improved, the
students would respect them. Calling die
damage to Gates Hall “out of hand" and
“particularly vicious vandalism," Tederr
man added, “It makes me wonder about
male single sex dorms.”

_——WGBI(BIIII FIIms-———

Directed by Michael Ritchie (1W5).
Starring Bruce Dern, Annette O'Toole.
Frl.,9*30 p.m., ARH; Sun.,a:30p,m.,ARH
(113 min.).

Smile is a sometimes clever, sometimes
iunny but ultimately shallow satire of the
most inane of the American rituals 7 the
beauty contest. Using the fictional state
finals of a “Young American MissH com~
petition, director Ritchie unmasks a score
of contestants who are really nothing more
than products for sale.

Bruce Dern plays “Big Bob"
Freedlander, used car hawker and head
judge in this Sexist display of flesh. The
film, though occasionally entertaining,
closely resembles a made-foretelevision-
movie and often makes cheap shots.
Rather than viewing these pathetic young
girls as victims worthy oi compassion,-

Smile simply snecis at them with total
disaffection. — Catherine Ingrassia

The ion! 6000MB

Directed by Robert Altman (1973).
Starring Elliot Gould, Mark Rydell.

Sat., 8:30 p,m , SL; Sun., 9230 p,m., SL (112
min i,

This early Altman film, loosely based on
the Raymond Chandler novel by the same
name, tries hard but doesn't quite come off
right. Any resemblance between
Chandler’s book and this movie is purely
coincidental.

Elliot Gould plays Philip Marlowe, but
not the one we all know and love. This
Marlowe has become a baffled
anachronism in the lurid landscape of con-
temporary Southern California. Chain
smoking,- drinking Canadian Club and

driving an old Lincoln convertible,
Marlowe gropes for clues based on out
moded assumptions.

This film seems to be a detective story
without any sort of detection, as events
rush by and Gould/Marlowe tries to keep
up with them. One discovers that narrative
drive is not Altman's forte. But this film
can be entertaining and worth seeing to
relieve tension irom finals, but don't go
looking ior pure Chandler, because you
won't find it here — Catherine lngrassia

KEV lill‘llﬂ

Directed by John Huston (1948),
Starring Humphrey Bogart, Lauren
Bacall, Edward G, Robinson.
Sat, 9:30 pm, ARH (note change).

it not the greatest oi the Bogart and
Bacall films, this follow-up of Casablanca

and To Have and Have Not is certainly one
of the most intriguing and dramatic. Any
chance to see these two legendary per-
formers is definitely not to be missed.
Bogart is nearly maniacal in his portrayal
of a returning war veteran who goes on
vacation to the Florida Keys, only to have
his vacation interrupted by gangsters who
have taken over his hotel Edward G.
Robinson recreates his archetypal
gangster role and Lauren Bacall plays an
acidrtongued hotel visitor who gets rather
attached to Humphrey. All together, this
makes for some pretty amazing
chemistry. The situation is the perfect
background for Bogart who has never been
so cynical, though of course Bacall reveals
this to be only the surface of his diaracter.
There's only one chance to see this
so don‘t hesitate. — John Spackman
