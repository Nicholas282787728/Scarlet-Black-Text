Vikings have fun, ﬁnances, few victories
Spirit of competition key for hockey club

by William Wllcoxen

They're certainly not the hardest work
ing athletes on campus. Many students
don‘t even realize that such a club exists.
Yet the Grinnell College Ice Hockey Club
has provided its players and the few hearr
ty fans who have supported it with as much
fun as any other team the college has to of»
fer,

Before going on, some things should be
understood about the hockey club As you
may have noticed, there is no ice rinkvin
Grinnell and this presents a severe han-
dicap to a hockey club. What's more, the
college has no money set aside for a
hockey program and no equipment to
speak of In addition, there is no real coach
for the team.

Given these difficulties, it is no small ac-
complishment that the hockey club has
been in existence for at least 15 years
Although no one is quite sure when the Club
was started, it is known that they have won
only one game in the last 13 years. Current
goalie Kino nuth played on the club whenv
he was a student from 197579. He said that
they had not won a game in the eight or
nine years before that, Grinnell's one vic-
tory came his senior year in a game played
the morning after Grinnell had invited

Ruth noticed improvement in the team
in his days as a student but he is par
ticularly impressed with this year's team
There are more players on the team this
year than in previous years and they are
more competitive than they have been
This, combined with continued trustee sup»
port, has indicated a positive trend for the
hockey club.

members voted on their jersey logo and
chose a viking emblem The club has
become known as the Vikings rather
than the pioneers, This process has helped
bring the team together. “I think the
jerseys have definitely been a cohesive en-
tity for the team," said Britt

How can a team with this type of losing
record continue to take itself seriously,
even at Grinnell" ”We go into the games
knowing we're going to lose," answered
Britt. "But if we play as hard as we can
and do our best, then were pleased," The
Grinnell club has not had as much time to
practice as the teams they play against.
“The teams we‘ve played are all com»
pelitive teams." continued Britt, "We'd
been on the ice three times when we played
Drake."

One thing which helps to keep the
players' morale high is that they set
realistic goals, when Grinnell played

Although they had several good scoring
chances, the club was unable to successful-

Ruth said that given an ice rink and a
chance to practice regularly, Grinnell
could be competitive with the teams they
play ”II we could ask for anything it
would be an ice rink." he said. "Barber

Both Ruth and Britt feel that this year‘s
club has improved each time it has taken

midnight in Des Moines against a men's

weeks ago. That however was before the
Drake game which the players feel was a
beneficial experience, .

In addition to the dedicated and en
