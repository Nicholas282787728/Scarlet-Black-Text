Institutional llllllllcs

To the Editor:

1 am a senior who has spent all lour
years at Grinnell and will graduate (if
everything goes according to planl at the
end of the Semester. In my final days here,
I have been trying to tigure out what exact
ly I have gained from my ”Grinnell EXr
pcrience " I have learned a little about
ethics (and other abstract areas of
thoughti in my philosophy classes but the
most applicable things i learned were
about institutional politics I am very

, grateful to the people who taught me these
things and i would like to take this opporr
tunity to thank them publicly.

'First, I would like to thank the Dean of
Faculty Catherine Frazer. I took a class
from her in which we read about a concep»
tion of justice called “justice as fairness"
(by John Rawls), I learned a lot from that
class but I have also learned a lot by watr
ching Ms, Frazer's acu'ons. She was,
remember, one of those who deCIdeL‘l to
deny tenure to Dan Magurshak. Iam cer-
tain that she sees that decision as a just
one. Ms. Frazer is a very bright lady and is
fully capable ol convincing herselt that
any decision she reaches is just. Perhaps l
am not as bright but i am having trouble
seeing the decision about tenure as just
(assuming that; justice does have
something to do with fairness). Isuggest

The pleasure is back

Years belore l was born, the Surgeon
General determined that smoking would
be hazardous to my health. Obviously, the
Surgeon General never went to Grinnell.
After all, Grinnell is the home ot sincerity
and individuality and alter going here tor a
tow years, i consider mysell a sincere in-
dividual. i don't respond to peer pressure;
1 smokc because 1 enjoy it thoroughly.
More importantly, i realize that the
blisstul inhalation or line tobacco is one or
the healthiest pleasures to be tound at
Grinnell.

I discovered the joys oi nicotine the
same way that Jean Nicot probably
discovered them over 300 years ago; by
drinking. One torgettable night in the Pub,
smoking just seemed like the thing to do,
Since everyone else looked so relaxed tryr
ing to pick each other up by blowing smoke
in each other's faces, I simply could not
resist buying a pack or Vantages. I liked
the colors on the pack and was naturally
concerned about my health From that mo-
ment on, it was love at iirst light, 1 cough~
ed, tell dizzy and wanted to vomit I knew
that with just a little more practice, I could
become a good smoker I had laith that the
day would soon come when I could blow
smoke out one nostril and talk tor 30
seconds while spewing a white cloud of
aromatic exhaust,

I invested several dollars in the proper
training equipment, Winstons, Marlboros,
viceroys and Camels became the order or
the day. l prelerred Camels and Camel
Lights because that's what the real hard-
cores were smoking, I thought I'd never be

able to work up to their level oi excellence.
French inhaling and a packra-day seemed
like an eternity away. Only dirough
perservcrencc and dedication was I able to
work up to smoking Camel no—iilters and
Chesterlields on an hourly basis,

Then one day I went to the tobacco store
in lowa city. My life changed radically
that day. Sir Allred Dunhill replaced Lord
Chesterfield, Sobraiiie replaced the Camel

and I left Marlboro country for Brazilian
Carillos. Atter discovering the pure joy at
inhaling a 20rcent twig, life took on a new
meaning, I no longer smoke domestic
cigarettes. AS lor light cigarettes, such
things no longer concern me. After all, it
cigarettes didn't have tar I'd have no
reason to smoke them.

Of Course, the Grinnell College campus
hasn’t been entirely receptive to my imr
portation or toreign culture For some
idealistic hard-cores, Camels and
Marlboro: are the only thing to smoke. I
guess they're concerned about looking too
bourgeoise. And then there are those who
worry about tar ratings. They have no

business smoking anyway. They'll never
understand the joys of owning
pretentious little embossed boxes with title
pronouncable names like Sobranie, du
Maurier, Djarum, Carillo or Gitanc I
treasure these boxes because they tell the
world that I am more than a smoker
These ornamental packages distinguish
me as a connoisseur who allows neither
high prices nor high tar ratings to inhibit
his pleasure,

If you don't smoke and are nevertheless
enchanted by the prospect ol owning these
decorative joyrsticks, I encourage you to
start. If you do smoke and are trying to
quit, don't, I am convinced that there is no
healthier pastime in the world, Ismoke, I
inhale, I enjoy Adopt this simple
philosophy and your life will be as richly
satistying as the expensive Turkish smoke
that nestles deeply within your lungs Rer
ject it and lite will surely be as empty as a
Camel Light.

For those of you who refuse to see the
tlames oi truth, I can only tell you that you
are missing a truly integral part oi the
Grinnell experience While you Continue
your disgustingly boring tarless lives, I
will continue to relish the thought of inhalr
ing my gold-tipped pleasure-sticks.
“Bogus, pretentious and presumptuous,"
you say" I'll enthusiastically admit that
you‘re right, as a blast ot smoke pours out
of my mouth. ”Unhealthy," you say.
Nonsense, I say I might not walk a mile
for a Camel but I'd sure run one for a
Sobranie.

 

that Ms, Frazer go back over her notes on
John Rawls,

I would also like to thank George Drake
I have never had a class with Mr, Drake,
In fact. I have never even met him but I
owe him a debt of thanks for helping me
avoid a misconception about decisions,
Students are used to having to justify their
statements in papers, class discussions,
etc. Thereiore, a student might reasonably
suppose that an administrator (especially
the one who has the final word) would have
to justify his decisions to those affected or
at least be able to justify them, should any
questions be raised. 1 had actually believ-
ed that to be true until I saw the way in
which Mr. Drake justified his decisions. It
was only then that I realized that if you are
truly successtul in the real world, you
don't have to justily anything, no matter
how obviously unfair it is. This is probably
the single most important thing I have
learned at Grinnell and if Mr Drake
hadn't refused to Justify some of his more
controversial decisions this year, i might
never have learned it Justification, it
would seem, is a purely academic exerctse
haying no place in the real world.

Mostly, however, I would like to thank
Jim Tederman Mr Tederman has
presented an example of how much you
can do it you have power. It never tails to
amaze me that he has so many people
under his control but anyone who has ever
wound up on the other side of an issue from
Mr Tederman knows cxactly what i
mean, I had heard that power is all that is
important in the business world but I gain
ed an intuitive lecling lor that idea only
when I met Mr ’I‘ederman.

In closing, I would like to otter some ad-
vice to those oi you who still have some
time lelt here. it you want to get the most
our of your Class time at Grinnell, don't
waste it studying or going to classes There
is much more to be gained from watching
the people with power and intelligence. See
how they use it and you will quickly lind
that all those old outdated notions like
equity, tairness, justice and humanity are
no match tor the vicious destruction of the
more modern notions, like power, threats
and misguided intelligence. if you don't
believe me you can ask Mark Grundler,
Dave Renaud, Daniel Magurshak, Jack
Worley, Susan Isen or anyone else who has
recently had a disagreement with the ad-

. ministration. —i- Tom Spackman . . i
