Burling Library to reopen on, schedule

Construction continues, furniture delivery delayed

by Kim MacDonald

Although ﬁnding an alternative place to
study during the next two weeks could be
difficult while Burling Library is closed for
renovation, students may find the end
result wen worth the wait.

In an Aug, 19 memo to the campus, Col-
lege Librarian Christopher McKee
predicted that the library would reopen
“sometime in the week of 7»10
September.” This past Wednesday McKee
explained mat the contract with the con-
struction conmpany gave them unlimited
access to the building from the day after
commencement last May to the day after
labor Day weekend. McKee claims that
“with 40 to 50 men on the job every day"
the work progresses too quickly to ac-
curately predict the exact day when the
library will reopen. He did stress that the
library will reopen by Sept. m at the very
latest.

When Burling does reopen, many sec-
tions of the library will still be under con-
struction. The basement, which will con-
tain the archives. library staff rooms and
the bathrooms will be far from complete.
In additon, the two extensions of die mez-‘
zanine Will be unfinished. One of these ex-
tensions will protrude over the main
reading room in the back and will contain
the new Nentieth Century Room, in-
cluding a lounge area and display cases to
exhibit the African sculpture the library

possesses. The other addition extends over .

the main doors and the new circulation
desk, it will house approximately 18 study
carrels including the amphitheater style
carrel towers as well as several carrels at
mezzanine level facing the east and west
walls. Each Carrel in this section will con-

tain a swivel chair. According to McKee,
the carrels which lace the main sidewalk
to Hurling will be an ideal place to watch
students entering the library.

Continuing construction and possible
closure at the library for short periods of
time are not the only minor set backs in
Burling. There is a delay in shipment oi
the new furniture and the staff will have to
obtain temporary iurniture. However,
McKee does expect most of the books to be
in their permanent plces by the end of this
weekend since by that time most of the
carpet will be laid, and the shelves in
place.

Aside from their size and general design,
the new Carrels bear little resemblance to
the old mock Carrels displayed on the mez-
zanine last year. The left walls of the car-
rels are carpeted for use as bulletin
boards. The remaining surlace of the car-

Still unfinished, the new Twentieth Century room off the mezzanine will
not be open by Sept, 10. Photo by Karl Dukstein.

Burling Library was originally built in 1958, and proved

obsoleteirt less than"'2‘$yea'rs. McKeé'éx‘p'ects the
redesigned Burling 't’d’be adequate for at least the next

25 years, if not longer.‘

rels, in additon to many other areas of the
library are covered with non-glossy beige
Formica. Light oak colored wood is used
as trim in the carrels as well as molding
stairwells, along the mezzanine and the
circulation desk and office area. In addi-
tion, the ceiling of the’circulation area is
covered by oak colored rods which will
help to cut down noise,

Soon the scaffolding will come down and this area wrll house the
reference section once again. Photo by Karl Dukstein.

Another feature in each Carrel is a

~screened window which the student can

open and close. McKee explained that the
temperature oi many spring and tall days
is not hot enough to justify air condition»
ing, but that a breeze in the library would
make it perfectly comfortable. Another
energy saving feature is the installation of
double glazed windows in the north and
south ironts ol Hurling,

Lighting is another aspect of But-ling
which has totally changed. Each carrel
contains an individual white architect’s
style Luxo lamp. Energy saving low watt
ilourescent ceiling lamps illuminate the
stacks. These lamps may be switched off
individually in each aisle and according to
McKee, may should not buzz like the old
lights.

With the two-story addition on top of
Burling, the number oi study carrels has
nearly doubled the approximately we care
rels in the old library. Most of the Carrels
will be assigned by lottery to students, but
several areas including the Carrel towers
in the front mezzanine extension will con-
tain unassigned Carrels. In addition to car—
rels, the main ﬂoor reading room and two

main aisles will contain the amoeba
shaped tables, similar to one of the tables
on display last spring However, these
tables will not contain a hole in the middle.
Instead or a liner lamp, they will each have
a “high tech” ceiling lamp suspended
trom above, The 297 chairs are light wood
with green and gold seat covers, a color
,pattem which the manuiacturer calls
“cornﬁeld" According to McKee, this
chair. which is of a “Sled chair" design
was the most popular experimental chair.

The general atmosphere oi Burling is
“much warmer“ now, ' according to
McKee, because oi the use of carpet and
the oak trim. The Carpet is brown and
grey, similar to that used in many new
high schools and office buildings. It is time
tional yet not unattractive. The walls are‘
mainly white and beige, and many or the
end panels of the stacks are also beige. The
main stairwell in the addition contains a
skylight.

McKee himseli is very happy with the
results, although he admits that he is
somewhat biased by his close involvement
with the library. He believes that when
students see the end result they will realize
the time and care which the architects
spent in redesigning the library. Burling
was originally built in 1953, and proved ob—
solete in less than 25 years. McKee expects
the redesigned Burling Library to be ade-
quate tor at least the next zs years, it not
longer. He sees the new design as a selling
point lor the college. whereas the old
library was somewhat or a drawback.
