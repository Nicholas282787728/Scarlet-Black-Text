sent Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger a telegram, asking that he
order an investigation oi the incident. Ac

distressing nolietheless.

Tempers ﬂare at Joint Board meeting

by Laura Carter

The adjectives traditionally used to
describe meetings of the SGA Joint Board
proved inaccurate at the group's Wednes
day meeting. instead oi being “boring" or
"unproductive," the meeting was
highlighted by an attempt to impeach the
Political Activities Support Fund chairper-
son, the resignation ol one hall represens
tative and a registration oi outrage by the
SGA auditor.

Following routine reports by SGA Presi-
dent Doug Rowe, Vice President Teri
Gould, Student Coordinator Amy Welch,
Social Coordinator Allison Paich and
Treasurer John Molfet, Auditor Leighton
Nakata announced that “a couple ofthings
really bother me." The first complaint he
voiced concerned the amount of ball funds
spent to cover the costs oi vandalism and
destruction on campus this year Calling
last semester's damage figure of $450
“unacceptable," he then termed the
$333.75 already spent this semester
“outrageous "

Nakata's second complaint was directed
to the Finance Committee. Because
groups requesting money from SGA are
not staying within their budgets, he said,
the Joint Board‘s examination of those
budgets was becoming useless. The
auditor asked the Finance Committee and
groups requesting funds to spend accor-
ding to their limitations. The SGA'S
general budget now stands at $3292.85 and
the amount left in the all-campus fund is
$941.

Initiative Fund Committee Chairperson
Marilyn Zielinski next reported the IFC
allocations during the past week. SASES
received $88 to help defray the transportas
tion and lodging costs of i979 graduate Jo

Looye's visit to campus and the Women's
Group was awarded $23 35 towards the
costs at showing a film about rape
Another $13 was allocated to SPLAG and
$50 was given to the BBB Breakfast

when Political'Activities Support mind
Chairperson Jim Goodfellow listed the
$13010 worth of PASF allocations, he
brought up the issue or his possible im-
peachment. Goodfellow said he had heard
rumors last week that Student Rules Come
mittee Co-Chair Bill McCullough intended
to initiate .impeachment proceedings
against him at this meeting, Wednesday
morning, Goodiellow reported, he found a
note in his post Office box from Mes
Cullough advising him to attend that even
ing's meeting. The PASF chair assumed
that any impeachment move would be
made against him because of his irregular
attendance at Joint Board meetings. The
SGA Constitution requires the PASF
chairperson to attend at least one weekly
meeting each month,

McCullough replied, ”Don't try to paint
a bad picture of me; you're implying
something that's not necessarily true."
Goodfellow responded, “I'm certainly
guilty oi violating this point in the constitu-
tion. I could have been here more; there's
no question about that,"

He said that the Joint Board should con-
cern itself with the quality of the Commit
tee aspect of the job he has done “It‘s
most important that lunding requests have
been handled adequately and promptly,"
he said, “When lhave proposals, lshow
up”

Goodfellow then questioned the reasons
for any impeachment action against him.
“Why is this happening in the 12th week oi

the semester? I don't know if it's for per

sonal reasons or a desirc to flex some mus,

cle, . I think it's a sham {or this issue to
come up at Joint Board.” The PASF chair
leit uie meeting at this point, because of a“
prior committment.

The issue was continued under new
business, following several reports. snc
announced an open meeting on possible
changes in the SGA constitution to be held

at 3:15 p.m. Friday in FDR-E of the ‘

Forum, Dibble Hall Representative Mark
Bradshaw then moved to vote Tracy Miller
550 to write the manuscript for a booklet
about SGA to serve as a reference
material for hall representatives, The mos
tion was approved unanimously, Monet
gave a report of the iunding request for the
Dibble and Main Halls‘ pig roast on May 2
and Welch described the budget for the
May 7 Waltz.

McCullough then reopened the issue eons
cerning Goodiellow. “There's nothing per
sonal against Jim," he stated, “In my opi-
nion, backed up by the constitution, 1 vote
that we remove him_” Because Goodfellow
had “superceeded SGA by-laws" by not at
tending, and ignored suggestions that he
go to the Joint Board meetings, Mes
Cullough described the PASF Chair’s ate
titude as, . . he'll do what Jim
Goodfellow sees fit ~ I just don't think
that’s a healthy attitude for a PASF chair.
I want Jim to be a little more
accountable." McCullough added that
Goodfellow had also failed to submit his
committee's guidelines ior second
semester approval,

After pointing out that McCullough had
not asked PASF members. about
Goodfellow's performance, Norris .Hall

Representative and PASF member Rare
tael Stein, who occasionally reports ior
Goodfellow, said. "Everybody in this room
has Violated the constitution at some point
or another, why did you choose Jim? Jim
is probably the most qualiiied individual
on campus to chair PASF."

A roll call vote was next taken and the
motion to impeach Goodfellow was
defeated on a count of two in favor, nine
opposed, six abstaining and three not
responding.

In other new business, Younker
Representative and SPLAG organizer
Tony Kulick said SPLAG has approx»
lmately sot) signatures on its petition opv
posing administrative authoritarianism.
Regular meetings are also now being held
in ARH II at 9:30 p.m. On Thursdays.

Reg Archambault, president oi James
Hall, then resigned his Joint Board posi»
tion. He cited several reasons for his deci-
sion: the dormitory has not had any hall
funds ior three to four weeks, he has “very
poor rapport” With the James Hall RA and
the dorm members have lost their unity,
He concluded, ”I'm pretty sick and bred oi
the way SGA is run, I don’t want to put up
with it anymore,“

A brief speech by Chris Lehmann on
behalf of the South African Support Group
followed, with Lehmann distributing infar~
mation packets about Grinnell's inc
vestments in corporations with South
Aiiican holdings and asking the Joint
Board to consider a general resolution for
divestment. McCullough, Smith Hall
President Michaelene Kelly and Student
Publications and Radio Committee
Chairperson David Molho expressed their
hesitation to divest and the meeting‘ended.
