Famous alumni making a name for Grinnell
Hollywood, gold medals and the New Deal

by Kim MacDonald

It is unfortunate. but being a student at
Grinnell poses certain prestige problems.
in some circles. the name Grinnell just
doesn‘t ring a bell and trying to convmce
your iriends, your parents iriends and
your snooty lvy League acquaintances
that Grinnell (no. not Cornell! is nota third
rate aggie school in the middle oi Ohio
may prove to be a diiiicult task.

Various methods may be employed.
such as listing the number of Marshall
Scholars this year. naming the last twenty
major concerts. complaining about having
to read Plato and Dante over spring break.
etc. One method you may not have tried is
the simple art oi namedropping.

Grinnell has produced an impresswe
crop oi famous and notesoei‘amous alumni
who have risen to the top of their profesV
sions in a number of fields including law.
politics. science. music. journalism and
education. It would be impossible in one
article to include all the impressive alumni
and the definition of "well-known" can‘t
but exclude numerous graduates who are
considered great achievers in their own
specific lields of expertise. Here are but a
very few of the more well known of Grin»
nell alums.

Frank J Cooper. otherwise known as
"Cowboy“ Gary Cooper is by most stan-
dards the most obvious "celebrity” to at
tend Grinnell. For years the rumor cu"
culated as to whether Cooper actually did
bring a horse up to Gates/Rawson Tower
and then shoot the horse after he couldn't
coax it back down the stairs again. This
story is generally cited as the reason lor
Cooper’s expulsion from Grinnell his
sophomore year. A rumor to the contrary
states Cooper left for financial reasons.
after which he went out to Hollywood to
play cowboy parts and make a name ior
himself in such films as “High Noon "

Thanks to the Paramount Pictures
publicity department and Cooper's
biographer. Larry Swindell. an unusual
amount is known about Cooper's two years
at Grinnell Swindell claims he was "Vic-
timized by ioreign languages." due to an
ambitious advisor who signed him up [or a

at to. As a Langan resident. "Cowboy
Cooper" played his cowboy image to the
hilt. strolling across campus in a ten gallon
Stetson and cowboy boots irom Mon-
tgomery Wards.

After he dropped out in 1926. Cooper
maintained close ties with Grinnell despite
the fact that while a student the drama
club refused to accept him as a member A
1930 issue or the magazine. College humor.
contains an article by Cooper entitled. A
College I Love." in which he writes. “I
wouldn't trade those two years I spent In
Langan Hall at my alma mater ior — well
for a good many things that the world
seems to set a high price upon,"

. Known lor his raucous cheerleading and

regular attendance oi iootball games.
Cooper reminisced about an old li‘lend in
College lliiuior saying, "If I ever have a
youngster, he is going to go to Grinnell and
beat all of Taylor's records. Just see if he
doesn't ”

The "Taylor" Cooper refers to was one
of his best friends at Grinnell, F. Morgan
Taylor. "26. A B.M 0.C and football lct-

InSlde that issue. the school extended
their congratulations and thanked Taylor
ior "putting Grinnell on the athletic map ol
the world." Taylor didn‘t stop there
though. he continued to run track and play
football until he graduated. He then went

on to win a silver medal in the same event
at the 1923 Olympics and linaily. a bronze
medal at the 19:32 games in Los Angeles.
Unfortunately very little is known about
the later life of this three-time Olympic
medalist.
