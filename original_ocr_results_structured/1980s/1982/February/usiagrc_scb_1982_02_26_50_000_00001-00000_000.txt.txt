This year and next “catch-up” years for tuition

Financial Aid Office plans for potential reduction in funds

by Katie Ingwersen and Marty Merloito

The 1982733 academic year appears
bleak for college students. and Grinnell
students are no exception Grinnelllans
are faced with a tuition increase of nearly
$1.000 as Well as possible Cuts in federal
aid.

To determine how much the comprehenr
slve lee will be raised each year. the
trustees lirst approximate the costs or
operating Grinnell the tollowing year.
Then. they look at the total revenue to
determine what Will be available to meet
the costs. The total revenue has three com~
ponenis, the largest is the student revenue
which includes tuition. fees and room and
board. The total of these is 62.3 percent of
the total budget. The endowment line
eluding boﬂ'l restricted and unrestricted
funds) is 21.4 percent of the total budget
and the remaining category Gtits and
other items. including revenue from the
forum grill. the bookstore and Grinnell
House is 16.. percent at the total budget

Totttl t‘iist vs. i'ost to Student

According to Waldo Walker. executive
vicerpresident ol' the college. students are
paying 524 percent of thetr total costs
This year. lor example. the total Cost lol‘a
Student is 510615 34. With each Student
paying around ants in comprehensive
fees At Comparable schools said “alker,

'Students pay as much as hit or do percent
of the total cost per student. ’ Regardless.
many students at Grlnnell are wondering
why the rate or increase in the comprehenr
stve lee Ior next year is higher than the
rate ol Inllatiun. According to Walker. it is
necessary to look at previous years tor the
answers.

About ten years ago. students' tuition
and fees were 70 percent 01 the total cost
Then. beginning in lino. and continuing for
[our years. the students paid only about so
percent of the total cost and the lees were
not increased at the rate oi inllation. In
1979. the trustees decided to raise the come
prehenswe fee to 14 percent [or the 1980th
school year Walker referred to this as the

"catch up years," in which we were cats
ching up tor the previous years when the
increase had not kept up with intlation
Since the inﬂation rate was also around I4
percent in 1980. student lees increased did
not add much to the total budget that year.
However, this year and the next year have
also been designated ”catch-up" years,
Walker felt this increased revenue train
students is necessary to maintain
Grinnell’s "aid-blind" admissions policy.
by which students are admitted on
academic ability rather than on ability to
pay.

Director of Admissions and Student
Financial Aid John hopkms and Assistant
Director or Admissions and Financial Aid
Richard Vos both tool that Reagan’s cuts
will not greatly ailect Grinnell because it
is a private and independent institution

slightly more than half or all Grinnell
students receive linancial aid It is in the

percent of the total cost per student."
