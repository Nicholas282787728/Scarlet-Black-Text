'Fesf features Becks, brats

and Boddicker's Polka Dots

by Kim MacDonald

With an estimated price tag of $10,000 to
$12,000, this Saturday's Oktoberfest may
seem a bit extravagant, but in actual food
and labor costs, the amountis justifiablein
many ways. According to Dave McCon-
nell, director of food services, “The food is
the same as the German special dinner in
past years, but to make Oktoberiest a hap-
pening, you need to do extraordinary
things." These “extraordinary things" in-
clude employing extra workers to move
certain kitchen equipment to Darby, runn-
ing a longer dinner hour with more start
and paying tor the $1,000 polka band which
will play ior iour hours.

In addition to food and music, there will
bmgs of Beck’s German beer provided
by SGA, At $75 a keg»,.the Student Coors
dinators Office will finance the venture
with the profits made by the sale or beer
mugs. The glass mugs are emblazoned
with the words “Grinnell College
Oktoberfest" and a picture of a man and a
woman in beerfest garb will sell for $2 50.
The actual cost at the mugs is $1.70, and
the remaining 80 cents will go towards
paying lor the neck’s. In order to drink
beer during dinner, students and guests
must purchase beer mugs which will be on
sale prior to the event.

After the dinner, which ends at 7:30
p,m.. individual drink tickets will be sold
for 7 scents each to those not wishing to at-
tend the dinner, In addition to Beck’s and
possibly some kegs oi Budweiser, when
Darby opens to the campus public, there
may be some extra lood available. since
McConnell does not want any leitovers.

“The mugs were the easiest way to con-
trol payment tor the kegs," McConnell ex-
plained. adding that since he is an aide
ministrator of the college, Food Service
itself cannot furnish the beer, “It's silly to
attempt to put on an Oktoberfest without
beer,” Claimed McConnell, which is why
he enlisted the help of the Student Coors
dinators Office to provide the beer for the
allcampus event,

“This is not a money-making proposi»
tion,” McConnell noted. although he will
not know the total cost until after the
event. Any “surplus cash" up to $250 will
be returned to SGA which donated that
amount towards the band. Any profit
beyond that will be returned to the general
iood service budget.

Some students, ﬁpecially those who live
oil—campus, find the $6 dinner ticket-cost
rather expensive. Regular special dinners

cost $6 for those not on board. On steak
night. each 10 oz. U.S. Choice New York
strip costs an average of $4 Two years
ago, McConnell got a special deal on
lobster tails and held a $7,000
lobster/chicken Kiev dinner shortly before
winter break.

Thus, “as far as actual food costs. this
might be cheaper," claimed McConnell.
He explained that it is necessary to charge
parents because it wouldn’t be fair to all
student to subsidize parents from the
general food budget The $8.50 price tag
(including beer) is “a decision you have to
make,” alleged McConnell, “but it's real
value for cost. . . parents may really enjoy
it.” He does not believe that parents who
normally pay “325 to $30" will mind and
argued that “families normally scatter."
He thinks the benefit of ”a campusrwide
atmosphere” is worth the cost,

Responding to a question at whether
parents will want to eat on board after
hearing their children’s complaints about
Grinnell food, McConnell commented that
“It is traditional for students to
complain.” He feels that parents won‘t
take the complaints strongly into account.

Oktoberfest is an experiment, and Mc-
Connell hopes people will “just try it.”
Saturday's test will be. for McConnell, a
test of “the validity of centralized dining
and the etiects oi group dynamics.” This
will be the first time the whole campus has
gathered to eat under the same roor.

McConnell predicts 900 of the 958
students on board will attend the event
wiui “at least zoo parents" and anywhere
from ”100 to 300” off-campus students,
taculty and administration, in all, he ex~
pects a crowd or i,200 to 1,400 people.

Boddicker’s Polka Dots, a sinpiece
polka band from Cedar Rapids. will play
[or three and one half hours, A roving ace
cordian player will entertain the crowd
during the band's dinner break. Kegs and
hot food will be set up in the north end of
Darby. while the stage will occupy the
south end. Salad. bread and other cold food
tables will be set up at the north half, but
cleared later for dancing. At no time will
there be any tables for eating; seating will
be in the bleachers

Parents may buy dinner tickets at
Parents' Weekend registration. Beer mugs
can be purchased in front of the dining
halls tonight and at the door tomorrow
night.

A motion which would change Joint
Board’s treatment of new business was the
center of debate at Wednesday night’s
SGA meeting, The motion. proposed by
James Hall President Matt Golden, would
prevent voting on new business items
which hall presidents had not first placed
on the agenda or posted prior to their con-
sideration at JB meetings.

According to Golden, Joint Board wollld,
“be a better public forum if people know
what we’re going to talk about. , , (the
change) gives hall presidents time to
solicit opinion from hall residents."

Opposing the motion, many Joint Board
members argued that it would defeat the
purpose oi new business by preventing
prompt action on pressing issues, Loose
Hall Co~President Katharine Altemus add-
ed that issues clearly deserving oi campus
opinion could be tabled for later discus-
sion,

Further debate centered on the extra
paperwork entailed in the enactment of the
motion, in particular that which would be
required ot hall presidents.

Not satisfied with these arguments.
Golden asked JB members if they were
“willing to sacrifice expediency over stu
dent representation"

Responding to these concerns, SGA
Secretary Marilyn Zlelinski iniormed JB
that, if members were willing to wait until
‘hlesday tor their minutes, she could allay
pressures on hall presidents by including

 

new business on the agenda, She further

SGA considers by-Iuws change

added that those motions conceived alter
the Monday night deadline probably will
not retlect a great deal or ioresight.

Cutting short debate on the motion, SGA
president John Monet called tor a vote.
The motion was passed by a show oi hands.
immediately upon its acceptance, Vice-
President Mark Bradshaw pointed out that
the motion may constitute a change in SGA
by-laws in which case it must be approved
by Joint Board at two consecutive
meetings. Thus, the late oi Golden’s mo-
tion will not be determined until next
week. ,

Finally. a $305.86 expenditure was ap-
proved for Younker Hall's Halloween Par»
ty, Discussing the request, Off-Campus
College-Owned Representative Paul
Bethke moved to allot additional money
tor Younker residents who work at the par
ty stating that, “The people working there
should have some kind of renumeration.
They‘re doing their part.” Bethke later
withdrew the motion when Younker Hall
Co-President Joe Neri informed him that
the extra funds were not needed, The in
itial iunding request was then unanimous-
ly approved,

In his report, student Rules Committee
Chairman Eric Pedicini declared that me
committee would be “starting irom
scratch" on the SGA Constitution revision
because no record or last year's committee
work can be lound.

 

 

Three women set precedent in Iowa campaign

by Brad Vander Linden

Athough it is a non-presidential year,
Iowa's elections are sizing up to be some of
the most important tor women in the na-
tion. The Grinnell area election is the only
one in the country which boasts three
women heading the Democratic ticket e
one candidate (or Governor, one tor Con
gross and one for the Iowa state House

The gubernatorial race ieatures Roxe
anne Conlin, long time activist in
Democratic politics and larmer U.S. At»
torney for the Southern District of Iowa
Conlin received her law degree from
Drake University in Des Moines at the age
01‘19. Prior to her appointment as US, at-
torney, Conlin served as an assistant at
torney general in Iowa heading the civil
rights sections of the Iowa Department of
Justice, where she concentrated on anti
trust work and ferreting out several in»
cidents of misconduct by federal officials

In 1977, Conlin joined the Carter Ad-
ministration as a United States Attorney,
directing her efforts toward prosecution of
white collar crime, fraud against the
iederalgovernment and narcotics traffickr
ing. She and her staff were honored for
their work with a special FBI. commenr
dation and the U.S. Secret Service Award
for outstanding achievement.

Conlin founded and served as the first

chair of the Iowa Women’s Political
Caucus that has grown into an inﬂuential
women‘s lobby group throughout the state.
She also served on the board of directors of
the Polk County Rape and Sexual Assault
Care Center in Des Moines and was later
selected by Governor Ray to serve on the
Iowa Shares program. This program was
set up to provide reliel to Cambodian
refugees fleeing the oppression and
atrocities of the Pol Pot Regime then in
control of Cambodia.

Conlin has been called by McCall's
magazine “one of the 44 women in
America qualitied for a cabinet position ”
In 1974, she received the Iowa Civil Liberr
ties Union's award ior outstandingservice
to Civil Liberties. Last year she“was
elected to the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame.

The race for Congress in Iowa's third
district, including Grinnell, sports a liery
rematch between Lynn Cutler and Incum-
bent Cooper Evans. who beat Cutler in 1980
by one percentage point, Cutler, 43. of
Waterloo, began her political career in
l974, when she became the first woman
elected as a Black Hawk County Superr

Visor. In her first term she assumed the '

board chairmanship tor two years, winnr
ing a second term in 1978.

In addition to her duties as supervisor,
Cutler has represented local government
concerns as a board member of the iowa
State Association of Counties, the National
Association of Counties and the National
Association of Regional Councils. As a
Black Hawk County Supervisor, Cutler has
worked to promote jobs and business
growth, and spearheaded programs on
behalf of the elderly, children and the men-
tally retarded.

After narrowly losing a bid for the 3rd
District Congressional seat in 1980, she
devoted her energies into rebuilding a
then shattered Democratic Party. In
February of 1981, Cutler was elected ex»
ecutive Vice chair of the Democratic Na-
tional Committee.

As the DNC vice chair, Cutler crisscross
ed the nation speaking mainly to women
and youth groups to encouraging them to
become active in politics. Cutler pointed
out that only 11 percent or the people bet-
ween the ages ot 18 and 26 voted in the lead
election

A former teacher, Cutler has been
outspoken against slashes in financial aid
to college-bound students by the Reagan
Administration. In a district redesigned by
the '80 census table more favorable to a

Democratic candidate, Cutler’s chances
against her opponent are greatly improved
in what is touted as the closest and hottest
congressional race in the state, -

The third candidate and only incumbent
is Janet Carl (Dem.-Grinnell). As a
newcomer to politics and campaign
organization, Carl, the r'ormer Associate
Dean of Students at Grinnell. left the Col-
lege's administration to run for the Iowa
House in 1930. In her first term Carl spon-
sored over 30 bills and amendments rang-
ing from providing property tax credit for
soil conservation to imposing a state sur~
tax on a corporation's federal windfall oil
profits' liability.

Carl serves on the Education, Human
Resources and Energy Commission and
the Social Services Appropriations Sub-
commitee. She was appointed by the
speaker of the house to the Commission on
Aging and the student intern Committee
and is a member of the Democratic Task
Force on Agriculture and Student Finan~
cial Aid.

Carl‘s proiessional experience includes
higher educational administration,
counseling and teaching, retail sales and
management, and organizational training
and consulting.
