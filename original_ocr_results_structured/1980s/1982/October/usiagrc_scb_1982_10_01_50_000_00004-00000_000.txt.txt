While searching the stacks ln Burling
this summer, ostensibly looking for a [“k
book, I discovered a slim, bright orange
book titled The Great Core Curriculum
Debate. My interest was aroused and when
I discovered that Dean Frazer was the on-
ly person to have checked It out, my
curiosity got the best of me. The book is
worthy of our attention for two reasons: 1)
its reprinting of the Harvard Report on
Core Curriculum and its subsequent
debate and (2) the pencil notes in the
margin, 1 would never accuse anyone of
the defacement or vandalism of college
property and certainly not our revered

dean, but whoever did Write in this hook '

before I checked it out, indicated a distinct
lack of comprehension of the arguments
involved as well as a pronounced an-
tagonism towards students. Well, what can
one expcet from those who would van-
dalize college property, a deep sense of
humanity as well as a respect for people
and possessions?

1 am assuming that the Harvard Report
on Core Curriculum, hereafter referred to
as "H4C.C.," will have some bearing on
Grinnell’s considerations on curriculum
changes. (After Mr. Wall’s remarks last
year on the issue and the propaganda pro-
claiming Grinnell as the “Harvard of the
Midwest," there seems to be little doubt.)
However, both the authors of ﬁle H.ClCl
and the editor of the book warn against the
deification of the II.C.C. They further aver
that the H.C.C was “designed for Harvard
alone and no other institution . . . . If for no
other reason, other institutions cannot pat
tern themselves after Harvard because of
its unparalleled wealth and academic
riches. Harvard undergraduates are ofr
{cred a choice of some 2,500 courses." The
ECG. was seen as a way of guiding the
students through those academic riches
and not locking them into a set pattern.
These distinctions are ignored by our crypc
tic copyist. what is noted, and with the
greatest of care, is the breakdown of what
the H.C.C. will cover, how it will be label»
ed, its distribution on transcripts — the
general mechanical details that
bureaucrats thrive on.

lLC.C. was seen as a way to define with
what every student at Harvard could ex
cept to walk away. What does a liberal arts
education at Harvard mean'.’ Roughly, two
years worth of credits in one’s concentra»
tion, one year devoted to the u.c.c. and
one devoted to electives. The H.C.C. ad-
dressed five areas of education: Art and
literature, history, social analysis and oral
reasoning, science and foreign culture. No
specific courses were assigned or
designated. From the report,

We have not esuiblished an iden-
tical set of courses for all students,
or an even-handed introduction to all
fields of knowledge, The prolifera-
tion of Knowledge and the diversity
of our students make both of these
goals impractical. We do not think
there is a single set of Great Books

that every educated person must
master, and we do not think an inn
evitably thin survey of the tradir
tlonal subject areas 7 humanities,
social sciences and natural science
~15 any longer useful, [Albeit a one
year survey is not (do thin] . . .
Finally, the ll.C.C is not intended as
a model for higher education in
general, We dot not believe all cola
leges should perform the same lunar
tion or offer the same curriculum,
indeed, we are dismayed by the
uniformity that has come to
characterize much of higher educa-
tion.

Indeed, we are dismayed! The diversity
of the student body at Harvard made it im»
possible to assign a single set of courses
for all students. What about Grinnell?
What about the praise of the student body
as one of the most diverse educationally,
socially and economically in the nation?
Can we seriously impose a rigorous and
unflexible standard on everyone and then
proclaim them educated? When I asked
this same question of Professor Farslow,
President Drake and Dean Frazer at the
meeting on core curriculum last year, I
received no answer. The dismaying unifor-
mity of other educational institutions was
what attracted me to Grinnell in the first
place. Grinnell is hardly the model of a
progressive institution, but at least ﬂ’lere is
an acceSSIbility in deciding what cons
stitutes my education and not one mass
produced for 1,200 students. (The
malevolent being responsible for the
defacing of this back did not homer with
the proceeding passages, Curious, n‘estcce
pas?)

The HlC.C4 is a halfahearted attempt to
justify a liberal arts education in a world
of specialization. if they really believed
that a guideline was needed, why are two
years set aside for the major and only one
for the H.C.C.? Mr. Barry O’Connell
smted:

Most proposals genuflect dutifully

to the usual cliches about the

knowledge explosion, the expansion

of the universities, and the problems

of specialization, Litﬂe institutional

selfvexamination occurs, and when it

does proposed reforms are, with
disheartening frequency,

mechanical and bureaucratic . . . .

The crucial questions — about the

role of the university in maintaining

inequality [by this he means the
educational elite becoming the
social, economic, and political elite]
and about the desired ends of
undergraduate education — are left
untouched.
Instead of addressing whatever problems
there are at Harvard, the H.C.C. address-
ed what everyone assumes are its pro-
blems.

arts education at GI‘IDMIU Drake said at

John Kerr

Lounge last year that he felt only 90 per»
cent of students are getting one, so that’s a
problem. Do we have a definition for a
llberal arts education or, better yet, do we
need one? If SO, then that is a problem.
Would one deflnition of a liberal arts
education delivered by Morris Parslow (no
doubt in the same manner of Athena spr-
inging from Zeus head) he better than the
free exchange of many definitions between
faculty and students? (Yes, I do exclude
the administration from this process. They
are the most efficient and happiest when
counting the number of paper clips
distributed during any given semester.)
How are the currently required courses
viewed by both students and faculty7
When I took Literary Problems, the re-
quirement for further studies in the
English department, 1 had anticipated a
rigorous dialogue between faculty and
students in the areas of literary criticism
and the writing of papers. The professor
harbored none of those misconceptions.
For my professor, the course was a
necessary evil, a bone-head course meant
to weed the wheat from the chaff, and the
further reﬁnement of skills was not a cone
sideration. Either the students shared this
opinion or they soon adopted it. Would any
other “required" courses be treated with
any more dignity than that? Will 1 pay in
excess of $8,000 a year to sit through more
of the same? (Indeed, we are dismayed!)
From ﬂue Dahl Report to Yale, subse-
quently ignored by the faculty and re-
jected,
Education ought not to be thought
of as a process in Whld’l resisting
students are cajoled or coerced into
acquiring knowledge during certain
fixed v and fortunately brief 7
periods in the lives . . . it seems ab-
surd to assume that the day he earns
his diploma a student will be able to
take on the responsibility for his own
learning during the rest of his life if
he has not already assumed that
responsibility during the years
before he graduates,

One final note on the cankerous worm
responsible for the vandalism of college
property; our friend underlined a par-
ticularly telling remark made by Henry
Rosovsky, the Dean of Harvard. It reads,
“The student press was generally opposed
to us from the beginning, That gave me a
lot of heart because i felt l was probably
doing something right." who could this
culprit be? A trial‘s too good for ’em, I‘m
for stringing ’em up right now!

I got the same indescribable fee

that’s the way l feel about waking up 0

editors of the Register told me themsel
that it was my newspaper 7 “Welcom

Sarcastically, Grinnell

A few nights ago, when I was thinking
about what I could write this week‘s col-
umn on, I left my room semirconl’used and
went to dinner. Well, the minute Ilooked at
the fine cuisine offered Ibecame so furious
that I knew I would have to use the power
of the press to expose the slow torture of
Grinnell students through food poisoning.
There are those who say that Grinnell is
much like prison; well I’m sure prisons
have better food.

I‘m not going to be nice |n this article
(why should I or for that matter why
should any of us?) because I've had it. The
food in this fine learning institution is get-
ting worse and worse. Maybe as you grow
older, but I’m hardly an old man, you get
tired of eating crap (not the word I wanted
to use).

There are so many annoying things to
write about when we are looking at the
food situation on this campus. First, we
Harvard of the Midwest college students
actually wait in line to EAT (just a figure
of speech) at Cowles and Quad, The line is

actually quite amusing in isell. We lin.
to have our ID’s checked to make sure i
no one eats twice! (Would anyone in t
right mind eat once? ) After my first in
here I thought they checked cards in or
to assess the number of people who sur
ed the last meal. '

Another annoying thing is the na
they give their wonderful entrees, suc
gourmet casserole, pizza rustica, fi-ien
fish and liver fiesta. What is really
ritating is that they are serving us this a
bage and at the same time they’re mak
sarcastic comments about the fact that
have nowhere else to eat. Where do t
come off? The only way a gourmet c
would come into Quad is in a well equip
bulldozer. And what is rustic pizza? D
mat mean it wasn't sanded before it
slapped on our plates?

they have to look at and handle that
