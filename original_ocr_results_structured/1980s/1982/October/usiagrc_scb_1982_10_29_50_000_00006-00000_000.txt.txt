A pretty good lineup at tilms is in store for
this weekend, due to Black Cultural
Weekend and Halloween, Top of the list is
Milos Formal-rs Ragtime (1981, 155 min),
an impressive but lopsided movie. The
film concentrates on one main story,
Coalhouse Walker's rise to notoriety, and a
subplot, Evelyn Nesbit‘s rise to the posi»
tion at America‘s ﬁrst sex goddess.
Howard E. Rollin Jr.‘s Ct alhouse, a man

charms turn into fatal righteousness «\an

small but pivotal role. The only lzlsl
member not up to par is the much acclaim-

unfortunately falls into the dumb pro-

Still. this stands as a fine film worth sce-

ing violence is very Vivid, Rarely seen in
the US, this is a unique opportunity to see
this fine suspenseful film — if you liked
Psycho, you'll love Deep Red.

A Hitchcock classic is the other "holiday"
oiiering, Dial M tor Murder (1954, 105
min.), starring Grace Kelly and Ray
Milland, is a charming movie. overflowing
with the Hitchcock touch. Ray Milland
realizing his wife tKellyl is about to leave

ror her money. He gets an old college
aquainmnce lAnthony Dawsonl to do the
deed. and spends the evening out with his
wife's lover tRobert Cummings) for an
alibi. Complications arise causing the
crime to be less than perfect. The fun of
Dial M lies in its duel of wits, as Milland is
mowed down by a superior intelligence.
Overall a rather proper and gentlemanly
chiller tor those oi you not up to the gore ol

Another fine ﬁlm is Norman Jewison's

as the lazy Southern sheriff and Sidney
Poitier as the Philadelphia homicide
detective deal with both racial and profes-
sional tensions. The result is a fascinating
interplay. Jewison does an outstanding job
or creating the subsuriace tension and cons
veying the prejudice. manncrs and morals
in this “sleepy" little town. The supporting
perlormances are quite good Though
some may think it dated, this subtle and
meticulously observed societal study is
still elfective and telling.

Wajda's attempt to come to terms with
Stalinism, as well as the contradictions
and lapses within subsequent Polish
regimes, is even more courageous than the
action of his surrogate filmmaker within
the film. Wajda reportedly said that one

useless, something to remember when
