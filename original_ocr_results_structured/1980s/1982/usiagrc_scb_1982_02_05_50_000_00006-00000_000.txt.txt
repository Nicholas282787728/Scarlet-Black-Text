Because Ginni Clemmens is known to
day as a children's periormer, writer and
singer of women‘s songs and allraround
guru. many people don't’know that she
made her mark in Chicago originally as a
banjo picker and, especially. blues inter-
preter Now she has come back to those
roots with an excellent celebration of the
blues idiom. Some or the compositions are
recent like Ginni's metaphysical "I Just
Can't Get Here Blues." which is a state
ment about just trying to get by that is teiu
ribly runny and important at the same
time. and Bonnie Koloc's "Children‘s
B1ues."performed with all the reeling Gin»
ni has. which is a lot. she even pulls off two
Billie Holiday classics. “God Bless the
Child“ and "Ain't Nobody’s Business It 1
D0." which is as hard a job as any singer
could take on. although i regret her
rewriting oi "Nobody‘s Business " it was
done. understandably, because oi the ac-
ceptance oi male violence against women
that the original expressed. To me. the
best piece on the album is "Razor." which
has a simple messag . "You can love me
like I am. or goodbye his thought is Cen~

philosophy. ~ Emily Friedman. review

The acting of Jackson and Finch as Sui-r
