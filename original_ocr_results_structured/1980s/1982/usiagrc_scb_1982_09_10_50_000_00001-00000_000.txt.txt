Grinnell to compete for Sloan grant
Problem solving, technological literacy stressed

by Daniel Nissenbaum
Drawing by liz Voigt

As a result oi a potential grant irom the
Alfred J. Sloan Foundation. within ﬂaree
years the Grinnell College curriculum
may reilect a muchgre‘ater emphasis on
problem solving’s'kills and quantitative
methods, similar to the college-wide locus
on writing skills.

The Sloan Foundation is a New York
based agency with a history at donations
tor the development of curricular science
in educational institutions. Grinnell is one
of 33 select small liberal arts colleges
across the country that the inundation has
invited to submit proposals for a malts
imum oi $250,000. The invitation explicitly
requires a program to “make applied
mathematics and technological literacy
more integral parts of their curricula

Mathematics Prolessor Charles Jepsen
chaired the committee that wrote me pro»
posal. The group was comprised oi 13
members representing a range of depart»
ments. The committee worked through Hie
summer, each member submitting a sec-
tion of the 70 page proposal, though the
iinal product was edited by Prols Jepsen
and Kissane.

The proposal is based on the need “to
develop the powers oi quantitative
analysis (which would also reﬂect) a
knowledge or technology and oi its place in
society." To accomplish this goal, the
committee called [or a tripartitle ap»
proach, entailing a greater emphasis on
problem solving skills in all courses, some
newly developed methods courses and
greater use of the computer thoughout the
curriculum. These changes would occur as
soon as the new courses and facilities are
developed, though the committee projects
a three year transition period subject to
continuous evaluation.

The committee identified three levels
upon which to iacilitate this new locus,
labeling them as ”lreshman,”
“sophomore/junior" and “senior.” Level
one, the freshman level, would include
“designated problem solving courses” to
provide the [undamentals of analytical
skills. Funds in this area would be
allocated to add a new two year stall per-
son to teach some intro sections in addition
to faculty summer seminars in statistics
and computing, the development oi a
diagnostic placement exam and the
redesign and expansion of the Math Lab as
a Quantitative Skills Lab. The overall
locus would be on problem sets, not only in
statistics courses, but also in two additions
entiued “problem solving and computing”
and “applied algebra."

Level two, or the sophomore/ junior
level, would provide a mathematical
modeling component to courses and an ex-
amination of relevant quantitative
methods. This stage involves the modifica~
tion oi many existing courses, among them
microbiology, human physiologl’. eXs
perimental design and differential equas
lions. Nine computer terminals would be
installed in classrooms to accommodate
these changes.

The iinal and most complex senior level
would explore the “problematical
reaches” of a discipline and its relation

ship to other fields. The additions are of
upper level technology seminars, oli-
campus internships and summer intern-
ships lor prois teaching the seminars; the
latter two would be in cooperation with the
DC-based Washington Center ior beaming
Alternatives. Two sample seminar topics
are entitled “Windpower Technology" and
“Biotechnology."

This three-tier integration represents an
eliort to make students better problem
solvers and more aware of the quantitative
methods used in the field The use ol com-
puters is the “means by which newer,
more adequate forms of problem solving
may be learned and applied. , . ." Jepsen
clarified this use. asserting, “We’re really
not talking about very much (actual) com-
puting."

Indeed, these changes and the grant
competition itself are a response to the in-
creasing attention paid to a nation-wide
technological illiteracy. A recent article in
Esquire magazine quotes a Carnegie
Council in Policy Studies on Higher Educa»
tion statement: “Because of deficits in our
public school system about one third oi
our youth are illseducated, illsemployed
and illequipped to make their way in
American society," The article examines
the change in our society irom an in
dustrial to a postsindustrial state, a scien»
tiiic and technologically based “iniorma
tion" society, one in which Six to seven
thousand scientiﬁc articles are written
each day. knowledge and lormation which
doubles every live and a half years

“Problem solving will be the means
whereby we get at this technology," ex
plained Jepsen, “to gather iniormation
about it, the problems involved and the in
roads necessary to solve them, whether
they be economic, ethical, aesthetic or
scientiﬁc.” The committee regarding
quantitative skills as quite necessary,”
designed the proposal to make this cur-
ricular component available to all
students.

The changes are not solely additions to
the computer facilities, although there is
an obvious link. “Beeling up the computer

courses is not what Sloan wants,” saidi

.iepsen. ”It requires a technique to be in.
corporated in all departments,” The in;
tended outcome of this technique isto itse
dam sets in the computer asa tool to gain
practical experience in classroom
meories. Student Representative Linda
Berkowitz hailed me changes as “the first
chance to use practical applications as an
exposure to the real world." “The
theoretical model becomes more realistic
and more accessible to tho studenti” .con,
tinued Jepsen.

Responding to potential tears of res
quiremenls, Jepsen added that the overall
changes in the curriculum have no im~
plications for the core curriculum: ”All
the committee members felt that to speak
of requirements would be premature,"
Any possible mandatory Courses would be
assigned by the Curriculum council and
then approved by the entire iaculty.
Jepsen considered requirements “ima
material," in that ii' the program succeeds

as planned, students should ”naturally"
want to get involved in problem solving
and methods courses,

Aside irom the additions to the course oi-
l'erings and the contemporary seminars
and internships. another indirect advan-
tage to the students will be the iaculty
development, the area to which mostoithe
grant would be allocated. All department
members will have the opportunity to par
ticipate in summer seminars, and the
senior seminar instructors may attend the
summer iaculty internship program; both
should serve to raise iaculty morale. The
changes will not result in the loss oi any
iaculty members or in regular class offers
ings during the transition period.

In View oi other recent curricular
developments, initially there was concern
that a possible overcommitrnent oi stall
and resources could develop it Grinnell is
awarded die grant. The realization oi the
common iactors involved in all the pro
grams allayed this iear. Speciiically, the
college received a grant irom the Mellon

Foundation to explore the use of corn
puters in the humanities division, in addls
tion to an award irom the Kellogg Founda
tion to study the relationship between
agriculture and the liberal arts. Three
other current programs include an in
house curriculum review, a summer use
program study and the participation in a
study conducted by the Association oi
American Colleges examining model cur-
riculum programs. All these developments
are tangent to the potential Sloan grant
and present an opportunity to incorporate
the new program,

Reiterating the analogy. Jepsen con
cluded that the proposal was an attempt to
place an equal emphasis on problem solvs
ing and quantitative methodology as is
placed on writing skills. With some
changes, it is expected that, as with the
writing skills. students will graduate with
superior abilities in critical analysis that
extend to the area of logic and reasoning
together with an increased awareness or
theoretical modeling.

Planning Grinnell's future

by Jeff Raymond

Grinnell College President George
Drake, at last week’s opening convocation,
mentioned his intentions to begin planning
a course for Grinnell's intermediate-range
future. While he said nothing as tar as
specific plans, he stated that Grinnell's
sellexamination should bring the college
more into line with the rest of society as
well as iirming up an internal direction.

The planning process. which is not yet
underway, will be headed by Edward Bars
boni director oi college evaluation and
planning Barboni prepared ior the project
by visiting other institutions around the
country and collecting ideas and suggeSs
tions {or Grinnell’s own undertaking, Both
he and Drake stressed that although ideas
were being solicited from schools where
such planning processes have already
been accomplished, Grinnell's plans would
have to be unique and fit the school well

Drake said that the decision to under
take the process was made last spring by
the board at trustees of the college. He said

that the board members sensed a lack oi
coherence in the school's direction and
board members will be actively involved
in the planning.

The planning will involve all aspects of
the school and will include input from
studens and iaculty. Work has already
begun on curriculum planning under the
direction of Coordinator of Oirricular
Development Morris Parslow. Drake said
ﬂat the total planning process should
stretch well into the next academic year

Very iew decisions regarding the plann-
ing process or where the new direction
should go have been made yet. Drake
Stated, “There are an awful lot of things to
be decided." Barborii emphasized the ins
iancy oi the process by saying, “We're still
trying to rind out the particulars
ourselves.”

A preliminary announcement concern-
ing the activities and plans resulting irom
the college 5 undertaking should be made
within two months.
