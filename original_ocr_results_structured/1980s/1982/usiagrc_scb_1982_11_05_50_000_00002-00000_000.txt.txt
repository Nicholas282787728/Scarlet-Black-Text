McGovern, Fitzgerald, ﬁlms, highlight Vietnam symposium

by Catherine lngrassia

what originally began as a brainstorm
by Professor Liahna Babener over eight
months ago has become me biggest Rosen-
iield Program this year _ The Unﬁnished
War: Vietnam Revisitedr

Returning from Eric Kyle’s informal
discussion about the war and its effects,
which over 90 people attended, Babener
was struck by the amount of interest on
campus about the war. She felt this topic
seemed a logical and exciting one for a
symposium.

Sharing her thoughts, Babener met with
immediate enthusiasm on the part of Pro
lessors George Mariscal and Randolph
Roth, and the three worked to pull the con-
ference together.

The week is a carefully woven selection
of films and Speakers designed to
enlighten die campus community on the
war and its effects on society. The films
were selected to set up the issues and con-
troversies later addressed in the con-

ference (see Weekend Linenph

Babener added that she hoped “the films
would help to build up an audience for the
conference."

With the symposium, the Organizing
Committee hopes to revise perceptions
and revitalize interest in the war. Equip-
ped with a more mature look at the war,
the student can learn lessons from the past
and use these lessons to address current
World situations.

Frances Fitzgerald, author of the
Pulitzer prize winning Vietnam chronicle
Fire in the Lake, will give the opening ad
dress. Fitzgerald will present a speech en<
titled “Vietnamhevisited.” There will be
a reception afterwards.

Headlining the symposium will be
former US. Senator George McGovern,
one of the most outspoken advocates for
withdrawal from Vietnam. McGovern will
speak at Thursday's Convocation titled
“Vietnam: All American Retrospective,"

Bucchanal. and carnival

by Jim Bickai

Sel el'al finance recommendations and
Matt Golden's troublesome bylaw were the
focus of Wednesday's JDlnt Board
meeting Also, the SGA booklet was refer-
red to an ad hoc committee for revision,
the security guards were approved and the
role oi student government wlth respect to
charitable organizations was discussed.

Golden's bylaw states that the main mos
tlon of a resolution must be placed on the
publicly posted SGA agenda at least 24
hours before the meeting, At the October
27 meeting Golden introduced an amends
ment to his own bylaw, adding that the text
of the motion must be printed in the agen~
da also. Therefore, the amended bylaw
had to be Voted on at last Wednesday‘s
meeting. Before this could happen Student
Rules Committee Chairman Eric Pedicini
offered a new amendment to the amended
bylaw, His amendment states that the
bylaw could be suspended by a twothirds
vote. The measure was voted on and pass
ed. Because of the amendment constituted"
a change in the potential bylaw, the iinal
vote had to be postponed until next week.
At Ulis point President John Moffett coma
merited, “I think we are getting a little too
bogged down with procedures here.”

Finance Committee Chairman Vern Juel
inll‘oduced two recommendations concern»
in}: funding for the United Wav Carnival to
be held Saturday in Darby Gymnasium.

ment. it passed unanimously, The second
iunding proposal called icr SGA to provide
matching funds for the money that is I‘BIS'
ed at the carnival. This money, a mar
imum of $500, was Slated to Come out of the
reserve fund. The reserve fund is the
money that was leit unspent last year and
totals approximately $12,000, $5,000 oi
which constitutes the SGA emergency
iund. Several members suggested that it is
inappropriate for Joint Board to be giving
the student actiVity money away to chari-
ly Golden claimed, “Its not our function,
we are violating the students' trust."
Michalene Kelly added, "I‘m not convince
ed this is me best way to spend our
money," Despite the opposition, the iuii»
ding measure passed by a voice vote.

The only other funding measure was
$2770 for the James Hall Bacchanal. Little
discussion occurred. However;.Kelly aXr

The people fight back: alumnus

explains community organizing

by Jane Kaufman

Bill Ferguson is a Grinnell graduate
(1975) who believes that, “In our society,
low and moderate income people have
very little power over political and
economic decisions that affect their lives
and, . . if those decisions are to be made in
the people's interest, then the people must
have power."

Ferguson was in Grinnell Monday and
Tuesday this week to give a lecture entitl~
ed, “The People vs the Utililes: Radical
Community Organizing.” After gradua~
lion Ferguson worked for the United Farm
Workers, organizing support through
boycotts. He then went on to the South End
Seattle Community Organization. a group
or lower income people working to gain
power over decisions directly aiiccting
their lives by putting pressure on those in
decision~making positions, frequently city
officials. Most recently, he has worked for
The Light Brigade as a researcher and
organizer. The Light Brigade lights
utilites in Seattle, Wash.

His job as organizer began with three
weeks of canvassing — knocking on doors
and asking people for money. He has
knocked on doors to find out the issues in a
particular neighborhood and has then
planned strategies tor attacking them.
”Taking diverse Views and finding a
strategy” is what Ferguson called the
most challenging aspect oi his career.
Ferguson iinds the most enjoyable part oi
hisoccupatlonls“. whenyoungerpeople
get together and you do something." Ma~
Jor drawbacks are the long hours, night
meetings and heavy schedule, according
to Ferguson, His job as researcher has in-
volved reading oiiicial reports and inter
viewing bureaucrats over the phone
"Through that process you learn who
makes what decision, who listens to whom.
You get to know some or the people, pai»
ticularly lower echelon people. You can
build a little bit of a relationship and
sometimes they tell you some stun that
you might not find out otherwise," he said.

in his lecture, Ferguson explained the
method or community organization
eslablished by Saul Alinsky. The objective

or this method is to get power for people by
building an organization, working on
issues that directly affect them, issues that
are in their self interest. One example he
gave was the building oi a dog pound in a
particular neighborhood. The Alinsky
method deals with workable issues that
can be changed and attempts to per-
sonalize these issues. Persuading key in-
dividuals rather than attacking an instilur
tion as a whole, is a iundamental part oi
this method.

About the success rate oi this type oi
organization. Ferguson stated, “If you do
a campaign and you choose your issue
right, you almost always win something
You don't always win everything you
want, If you're fightmg a utility rate hike,
you can cut the amount,"

Particular innovative approaches his
groups have used in order to achieve cone
fronlatlon and to pressure those in powers
ful positions include approaching people
on their way out of meetings and getting
media coverage whenever possible ”You
don't pursue controniation when it's un-
necessary. You use it most times. It's go!
so much educational value that in a way
you are looking ior confrontations, it you
can wm something Without going through
all the steps in it, then you accept that win
and you start working on something else.
But ii you’re really working, you're going
to run into a situation iairly quickly where
you need a confrontation, The power sec~
tor is just not going to give you what you
want," according to Ferguson,

Morally, Ferguson stated that he has
never worked on an issue that he didn't
believe in "i wouldn’t.” he said. "1 would
say I'm not going to work on it If you want
to do it, fine, but l’m not going to help
you,” Ferguson stated. "What I think is
behind community organizing is a belief in
democracy."

Ferguson asserted that. “If you don't
organize, things will get worse. The power
structure only respects the people as much
as it has to and if the people tall asleep, it
won't respect them at all."

can we look at the budget when we haven‘t
