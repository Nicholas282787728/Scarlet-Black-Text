A little sophistication

In talking with various people, I have
discovered that some people have been
"interpreting" my column (can a tutorial
be far behind?). One person talked about

called it, Someone else was talking about
my use of "literary devices." such as "ex

various and sundry meanings in the title,

There is something inherently wrong
with a society that does not immediately
leap into action when an electrical cone

there's no Justice”"

OK, so many words in the English
language serve multiple purposes, some

this is going too far. Justice is an |mp0rr

of 0t this, I've taken the liberty to jot down
some observations I‘ve made about

panded it; in a way they brought it to me.
That. however. was very different from
what happened here. As Steve Burnett
pointed out in his column. they were not in

each other I could say that I'm shocked
and appalled at what I saw that night but
the people who could understand that feel
the same way and aren't really the pros

As a projectionist, my attitude toward

belief at that time that the audience was
just as interested in the safety or the equip

operate this equipment but it belongs to
them. After what I saw Saturday night, I
have been iorced to change my views. I do
not consider it part of my job as a projecV
tionist to police the audience. I do,

however, consider keeping the equipment .

Justice played an important role in the

As a graduating senior, thinking back
over my four years here, occurs to me
that I have often been critical of the ad-
ministration. This criticism has often been
based on the idea that the students are
responsible adults and deserve to be
treated as such, I always knew that there
were individuals on campus who were ir-
responsible but never felt that the student
body as a whole had acted irresponsibly.
Suddenly it seems that the administration
may have had a more realistic View of the
students than I was willing to admit If we
do not ALWAYS act responsibly, we can
not expect to EVER be treated responr
sibly

Finally, 1 have a suggestion. Right now
it looks as though the money nceded to
replace the screen will be taken from the
film budget. I don‘t believe that the film
committee should be made to pay for what
was essentially gross immaturity on the
part of the entire student body. Therefore,
1 suggest that the students voluntarily take
up a collection to pay for a new screen. A
dollar or two per person would probably be
enough. We, as members at the student
body, are responsible ior what happened.
If we wish to be treated responsibly by the
administration, we must accept the
responsibility for what we have done. The
