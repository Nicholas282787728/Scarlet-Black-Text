Allred Jarry s Ubu trilogy will be
presented by the Theater Department this
Sunday and Monday night at 8 pm Co
directed by Sandy Moflet and Ellen
Mease, Ubu Roi, Ubu Cocu, and Ubu Ens
chaine feature the work of musical comr
poser, arranger and director for the per
formance, Rich Grinkcl' '83.

The Ubu plays are best understood
within the context of Jarry's gather sordid
life The son of an unsuccesslul wool mer-
chant and a mother with a history ol in-
sanity, Jarry grew up to be what one
literary critic calls, “a sensible maniac "
In the course of his short life, Jarry
became increasingly dependent on alcohol
which Caused what Mease describes as a

'deliberate and total derangement of his
senses “

Jarry presents his message both through
the Iarcical, apocalyptic theme and by
shocking the audience, Pa Ubu attempts to
take over me world and reduce it to total
chaos Despite the demonic prospects oi
Ubu's reign oi terror, these plays
celebrate sheer animal survival.

When Ubu Roi Opened in France in 1896,
audiences expected traditional 19th cen-
tury theater. Consequently, the opening
line, “Merdre!” lshitll, a word never
betore spoken on stage, brought the au-
dience to a state or pandemonium The

an I'OC

play continued to ﬂaunt tradition through
vulgar and irreverent allusions to
Shakespearean and Greek theater. Accorr
ding to Moiiet, the Ubu plays were a
"precursor to the theater of the absurd "

Grinker's musical contribution to the
plays includes about 20 original songs In»
itially, Grinker perceived the plays as
strange and avant garde, and set out to
write strange music. Later he decided a
normal rock background would bring out
the strangeness more effectively in addir
tion to being fun and easier for students to
relate to,

Grinker perceives that the purpose cihis
music is to help relate what is not explicitr
ly said in the plays. He explained, “when
the play was written, It turned tradition on
its head Rock music is also rebellious."
Most of the lyrics which Gl'inker and‘Joel
Baird cosivrote were irom Jarry's text,
although they've been adapted to common
vernacular, Also a iew musical quotes are
taken irom musicals and popular music.

The to musicians who make up the
musical ensemble also contributed ideas
which were incorporated into the score,
The ideas of the Core musicians, Nick
Cowie, Louie Hallie and Dave Houghten
were particularly helpful.

This is a iunny, aiiecting but sentimenr

tired or sex, violence and the intellectual
hie. this bit at sentimental iolklore about
an old man and his cat might just be the
thing you need For what it's worth, I
remember that as an eighth grader obsess

Often considered the masterwork of the

lege Folk Dance Show Once again, the
Folk Dance Club will present its dazzling
array of regional dances and costumes
from countries around the world.

Folk dancing has an impressive history
at Grinnell. Originally an outgrowth of a
PE, class, the group has steadily increas-
ed its repertoire and membership over the
years. Grinnell's iolk dancers periorm
dances of 26 different nationalities and
have costumes for 16 of them, These
costumes are all student-made and pat
terlled after authentic folk designs

Seven Samurai. Rashomaii and Der/ii
U1a|a — which you may have seen here
two years agol, lkiru is recognized as one
of the lasting classics of Japanese film and
the cinema in general Though famed for
his films about Japanese warriors,
Kurosawa here creates a study which
seems rather Western and has even been
called a statement of ”existential
humanism," yet is set against the
Japanese tradition and, speciiically,
against the modern Japanese business
world.

A city-hall station chief who has lived an
unreflectively bureaucratic life. now on
the verge or retirement, discovers that he
is dying or cancer and has only a iew mon-
ths to live Desperately seeking to master
his fate and find‘meaning for the last bit of
his life, he seeks solace in his family, turns
to debauchery and stikes up a iriendship
with a young woman, yet nothing he tries
can give him peace. Finally, he resolves to
turn his energy toward helping others.
bypassing all red tape and iighting his
fellow bureaucrats to the end DO see that a
proposal ior a park in a city slum is car-
ried through. He is driven by an
unassailable fervor and risks, understanr
dably, mean nothing to him. At one point,
conironted by murderers, he simply
smiles gruesomely at them and they {ice in
terror. He remains committed to the pro-
ject till his death and iinally through his
devotion becomes an inspiration to all
those around him

The film emphasrzes not the sentimental
potential in the Situation, but rather the
charactcr of a man in the throes of existenr
tial anxiety, it has been widely acclaimed
ior its beautiiul cinematography and
editing and while some Japanese directors
have claimed that his departure from

simplicity make him more Western than

This year's show is a smorgasboaro oi i2

The Bride Wort! Black

Directed by Francois Truiiaut tFrance
1968)

Starring Jeanne Morreau, JeanClaude
Brialy, Charles Denner,

“Why in the world would anyone Want. to
be Hitchcock when he could be Truffaut
is the question raised by a Time reviewer
when this trubute to Hitchcock by
ﬁance's ioremost director appeared to
mixed reviews in l968.

Those oi you who saw Jules and Jim two
weeks ago are familiar with Truffaut and
leading lady Jeanne Morreau. while The
Bride Wore Black is also a comic love
story, it is, technically, a suspense/horror
iilm. How you approach this film depends
on whether your loyalties lie with Truiiaut
or Hitchcock.

Morreau plays a melancholy lady who,
in vengeful memory of a beloved husband
shot on the steps of their wedding church,
stalks and kills the five men responSible
for her husband's death, This is a leisurely
study oi revenge. Morreau, wearing only
black or white throughout the film, por-
trays a fascinating heroine. Like
Catherine in Jules and Jim. she is forceful,
intelligent and full of life, yet also possess
ed by demons and iinally ravaged by the
sterile rights or her revenge.

Filled with good performances, this
carefully-worked out film belongs to the
minor genre or suspense but according to
Time, “Within these bounds, it is very
nearly a masterpiece." 7 Kimberly Mac-
