uy Ellen Heath

Three new resident advisors (R.A.‘s)
will be living and working on campus this
year, The three, Anita Close, Thomas
Crady and Charles Dewitt. replace Stuart
Mcnsinger and Nan Robinson and increase
last year's staff by one.

Charles DeWitt

Charles (Charley) DeWitt comes to
Grinnell, most recently from Ohio State,
but he grew up in North Eastern Penn-
sylvania. During high school he spent a
year in Japan as an exchange student. He
lived with three different families in Sen
dis, a city in Northern Japan,

DeWitt began college at George
Washington University but later enrolled
in St, Olaf College in Northfield. Minn.
After graduating there in 1977 he earned
an M.A. in college student personnel work.
He held assistantships during both of his
years there.

For the first year Dewitt was a resident
counselor at Ohio Weslyan. He said his job
in the residence halls there was different
than the RA job at Grinnell because it in
volved more disciplinary responsibilities
The authoritarianism the Ohio Weslyan
job entailed. Dewitt felt. hindered him
from getting to know the students in his
residence hall. One reason he finds Grins
nell College attractive is its comparative
lack of strict behavioral rules in the
dorms.

In his second year at Ohio Smte DeWitt
served as an academic advisor for honors
liberal arts students at that universny He
had about 180 advisees and found the work
interesting, but he still was not able to see
the students often.

At Grinnell, Dewitt said. he will be able
to interact with and counsel students
“without having to play the heavy."
Dewitt also said he hopes to become in
volved in some town organizations and ac-
tivities so he will be “refreshed" for life on
campus. He will be working in Career Ser-
vices, Dewitt lives in Cleveland Cottage
and is also the RA. for Haines.

this year is to try to upgrade the station to
ma watts oi stereo sound, but for the mo

station reelicensed at its present capacity
of 10 Watts mono. “9‘10 ‘3'?

In addition no the regularmdent shows
this season, Ethel plans to schedule more

special programming tlian KDlC has aired
in the past. One way he plans to make this
programming possible is by the use of
underwriting; whereby local organim-
tions and merchants help defray the costs
of a portion of the special programs,
Although this idea is new to KDlC, it is a
common practice of the Public Broads
casting System and National Public Radio.
