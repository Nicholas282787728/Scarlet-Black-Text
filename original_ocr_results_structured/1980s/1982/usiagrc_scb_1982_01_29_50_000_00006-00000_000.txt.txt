shows his fascination (obsession?) with
violence and its effects on the minds of the
audience. Primarily, the film is just a finer
ly made, exciting, and sometimes exr
plosive western, but its peculiar technir

“choreographed brutality" of many oi its
Scenes, indicate that Peckinpah had intenr
tions beyond mere entertainment

The film follows the decline and fall of an
outlaw gang in the early 19005, when the
frontier was Closing and Pancho Villa was
continually harassing the then corrupt
Mexican government. The gang moves

actor of incredible Versatility and depth.
His flexibility has led him to play a
tremendous range of roles from the stifir
lipped Colonel Nicholson in The Bridge on
the River Kwei (1957) to the wise and
warm 0 B.l Ben Kenobi in Star Wars. He
is one of the low actors equally comfor-
table in both supporting and leading roles.
Guinness believes that it is inherent in the
acting profession that one must be able to
believabiy portray an iniinite variety oi
characters He has stated that he never
turns down a role if he can learn something
from it or bring something to it

An outstanding example of Guinness’

' versatility is his performance in the first of

this six part series. Kind Hearts and Car-
oilets. In this black comedy on the art oi
murder Guinness displays his ilexibility
by his superb performance in eight roles.
Dennis Price plays the young hero who is
ninth in line to inherent a dukedom and
setsout to eliminate the eight in line before
him. these eight all being played by Guinr
ness. Upon its release in 1949 Kind Hearts
and Coiioiicts created a mild sensation
with its amoral lines and biting wit This
sophisticated black comedy is as engaging
today as it was when it was iirstprcsented
