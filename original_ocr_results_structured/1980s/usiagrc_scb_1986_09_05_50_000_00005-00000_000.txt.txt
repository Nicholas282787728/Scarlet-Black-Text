Relays Revised

The future of our beloved relays appears
to be in a perilous position because the
Iowa legislature has enacted a law raising
ﬂue drinking to twenty-one. In the past the
activities of Relay's weekend were
centered on beer drinking. So now what
will happen to the Grinnell rtelays which
aided students by ,allowing them a place
and time to blowoﬂ those high academic
pressures? in short, our need for relaxa»
tion was met through the relays. However,
now we face the possibility of losing this
relaxing and, most importantly, iun time,
all because the Iowa legislature has decid-
ed that we are too young to drink.

HOW should we 'respone? Should we
“standrup ior our rights" by rebelling, and
continue to center our relays on beer
drinking. Or, should we forget about Grin-
nell Relays and get an extra two days or
study? Certainly it we had a beercentered
relays we would possibly jeopardize our
own futures. The police could always pull
up with a bandwagon ready for loading.
Maybe we could have relays only tor those
individuals twenty-one and older. But then
we would exclude halt of the campus, and
relays would lose that wonderful at»
mosphere created by nearly the entire stu-
dent body participating together. What
will we do???

Maybe we could overcome these
obstacles and make relays better than
before and with even more participation
by the student body, After all there has
been exclusion of one group for the past
iew years; there was always a group of
people who wanted to participate; but

could not because there were so few, if‘

any, games ior those who did not want to
get drunk or get beer all over them. What
it now this group oi people could be includ-
ed and more importantly relays could be
fun once again?

Would not students love to see ﬂieir
favorite prof dunked? Yes, wouldn‘t it be
fun to see George Drake fall in a dunking
well? (You could be the lucky pitcher.)
This would certainly be one way to in»
crease administrative or proi participa-
tion in the relays. We could play such old
time competitions as “catch the greased
pig.” in our case we would slick a pig down
with butter, put it in a renced area, and
then Hie first person to catch the pig wins a
prize. (This was a favorite of the early
midwest plains larmer.) Wouldn’t it be
great to have the Relays’ board buy big
stuffed animals for prizes. (You know, like
the one you were cheated out of at the last
carnival you were at.) We could have our
own games where one stands up the beer
bottle with a stick, string and ring. Or we
could toss a ring around the Pepsi bottle;
or throw a soit ball in the slightlyvtipped
basket. Even more challenging would be
attempting to win a prize by climbing a
balancing rope ladder which is on an in-
Cline.

We could have food races too. How about
a bananasplit relay, (sponsored by a local
ice cream store like at larger
universities). We could shot-gun cans of
beer with AW root in it. (i.e. AW rootbeer)
Also, we could have an old time pit
barbecue with about two hogsI a side of
cow and maybe even some lamb. (Just
think, we‘d be showing our support {or the
local larmers.) The night before we would
prepare ior our barbecue with a timed pit
digging contest.

The choice is ours; the future of the
Grinnell Relays lies in our hands and
minds. Let’s show omers and ourselves
that we can adapt to an every changing
society and world. Yes, we can adapt in
such a way as to retain our righs: “liIe,
liberty and the pursuit oi happiness". by
Rich Percy '88

NOTHING IMPRESSES
AN EMPLOYER LIKE
DROPPING
OUT OF SCHOOL.

After several years of intense study, a lot of college gmduates ﬁnally learn
something. They’re not qualiﬁed for the job diey want. _
Fact is, many graduates never ﬁnd a career in their ﬁeld of study All their
time spent in study Not enough time in the ﬁeld. ‘
That's why there’s a nationwide program for college students called (A)
operative Education. It allows students to alternate studies at the college of
their choice with paid, practical work experience in the career of their chalce.
To partidpate in Coop Education you don't have to ﬁt into any particular
sodoeconomic group, You don’t have to be a straight “A" student eithel:

From Death Row

Dear Editor,

1 am a prisoner on death row at the

Arizona State Prison and was wondering if
you could do me a favor and run an ad for
correspondence in your campus
newspaper. I’m not looking [or anyone in
parn'cular to write to. Just anyone that
would be interested. I don't get much mall
and the mail I do get is irom the Courts or
my lawyer and it's also usually bad news
so it‘s just like not getting any mail at all
or worse than not geting any mail depen-
ding on how you look at things.

Anyway, it you could run the following
ad (or me i would really appreciate it:

Male prisoner on DEATH ROW at the
Arizona State Prison would like mail from
anyone that would like to write. I am
twenty-six years old without family and
would like correspondence with anyone
that has the time to write letters and that
would enjoy receiving letters irom me in
return. Please feel free to ask anything
you're curious about and talk about
whatever you want, I will answer all let-
ters written to me. stamps would also be a
big help since i spend all my time in my
cell and am not allowed to work to get the
money to buy them with. Anyone in-
terested write to: Michael E. Correll, Box
3-51493, A.S.P. DEATH ROW, Florence,
Arizona 85232,

Again, 1 would like to thank you for runn~
ing this ad (or me. I do really appreciate
any help you can give me. Life on death
row can get pretty lonesome and the
company through correspondence could
change a lot of that. Sincerely. Michael E.
Correll
