the forgotten element

Recently at one of the hall meetings, a courageous hall member ex—
pressed his objection to the smoking of marijuana in lounges and
hallways, The basis for his objection rested not on moral or ideological
grounds but primarily on legal grounds. The smoking of marijuana is il-
legal and therefore, for this student, knowing of such an illegal activity
and not reporting it would be a conspiracy of sorts

Such is not the usual train of thought for a typical Grinnell College
student. The farthest thing from a student’s mind when he indulges in
recreational drugs is the legality of the substance he is using.

This student’s objection raises an interesting question as to whether
we on campus are insulated from or indifferent to the law.

The use of marijuana and other recreational drugs is commonplace
and widely accepted. The serving of alcohol to minors at campus par-
ties is knowingly and willingly done.

During the past semester, phone fraud and check forgery occurred,
indicating perhaps students were not aware of the implications of their
actions.

The incidence of tampering with fire alarms and extinguishers, an il-
legal action, was one of the major issues brought before Judicial Coun-
cil last semster,

Last year at the showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, chairs
and bottles were thrown, water was poured on spectators and finally
the screen itself was destroyed. At a public movie theater (dare we say
in the “real world”) such a display would have been greeted with more
than an administrative slap on the wrist.

Now, most students will respond “This is college, we should be able to
do what we want. " That is true, to a point. But when students’ disregard
for legality moves into the hazy area of destruction of public property,
federal offenses and potentially endangering others, it is time to
reevaluate one’s actions and become cogniznt of the possible ramifica—
tions.

Checkpoint maxine

Every year it happens to eight to ten seniors; as they march in the
procession, eager to receive their own personal sheepskin, they are
grasped firmly by the arm and yanked out of line by the registrar 7
Checkpoint Maxine!

Needless to say, this can be a rather traumatic and embarrassing ex-
perience, especially for those seniors whose extended family is present
to see the fruits of a $40,000 investment, It is especially frustrating when
the credits in question are so few.

Well the faculty and administration has finally revised its rather
unfeeling policy of accosting the unsuspecting senior and has
demonstrated a more humane view.

At the last faculty meeting, they approved the recommendation that
“any senior who has completed eight semesters and is within eight
credits of graduation be allowed to participate in graduation
ceremonies." This doesn‘t mean you’ll get a signed diploma, but at
least you’ll get to partake of the festivities,

So all seniors struggling for those last two credits can put away their
bowling balls and badminton sets and switch their tassels with the rest
of them.

my. bmir the Iain. Let you. life be a counrlrfrit-

— Thu-cull, “07- Civil ouobcdicncc"

I recently received a letter from the
Selective Service System (SSS) informing
me that I am under suspicion of not
registering for the draft. My name was
probably found by comparing state
driver’s license registrations and income
tax returns with the SSS records. Enclosed
with the letter was a form to complete “to
clarify my status" (check one: “Please
register me," ”I have already registered”
and “I do not have to register").

I do not intend to return the form. I can-
not cooperate with the SSS became it is a
system whose ultimate function is to kill
other people, To cooperate would imply
support for the madness of militarism, i
will not follow the orders of my govern
ment unquestioningly, ior it is 1 who must
take the final responsibility for my ac-
tions. For this I am labelled unpatriotic
and a threat to society.

I know that I am not alone. The SSS
doesn't mention it, but they sent the same
form letter to cover 400,000 other
“suspected non-registrants," including
some men who did register and even some
women. The letter does not state that we
are legally obligated to return the iorm,
We aren't. in iact, it is a felony to register
more than three months aiter your birth»
day, punishable by the same penalites as
not registering, One judge has even ruled

that there is no continuing duty to register.

I can only conclude that the SSS is im-
plicitly threatening me with prosecution if
i do not respond. Since by the end oi 1982,
only 13 percent of the over 800,000
nonreglstrants had been indicted, this is
clearly an empty throat, I am more likely
to be struck by lightning than to be pro-
secuted.

Surely totalimrian scare tactics are no
way to enforce laws in a free and
democratic country. Normally, a defen-
dant is presumed to be innocent until pr
ven guilty and need not prove his in-
nocence, whereas this “Hireat” and the
tactic of requiring federal financial aid air
plicanu to prove their innocence blatanuy
violates this fundamental human right.

I presume that most oi the other in—
dividuals who have not fully cooperated
with the SSS have also acted out of the
strongly held belief that this law is wrong.
We must unite in our beliefs and refuse to
follow the dicmtes of our government
blindly. I challenge each of you to think
through the consequences of both courses
of action: cooperating and refusing to
cooperate. Follow your conscience instead
of your government, and above all, sup-
port your friends who take the harder
path.

SASG update

To the Editor:

After last semester's rather quiet
meeting with the Investment Responsibili-
ty Committee of the Board of Trustees
many students are confused about the cur
rent purpose or the South African Support
Group. During their last meeting the
Trustees considered, and, for the most
part, accepted SASG's list of compromise
demands. The mechanism is now in place
for students to actively voice their opinions
on the activities of the companies in which
the college invests,

The boards Committee on Shareholder
Responsibility will now meet regularly
with representatives of die student body.
They will jointly screen and take up a posi-
tion on stockholder resolutions and will in-
itiate resolutions in those corporations in
which Grinnell Collge owns stock and
which have operations in South Africa.

What is the process of initiating a proxy
resolution? To advance proxy resolutions
each proponent must submit a maximum
oi two proposals, each of which is not to ex-
ceed 300 words, If the management of the
corporation opposes the proposal, the pro-
ponent has the right to include a 200 word
defense with his request for the inclusion
oi the proposal, The proponent must pre-

sent his resolution at the annual meeting, ‘

The proxy resolutions must be submitted
at least to days beiore the date corresponr
dmg to the date that the proxy material
was submitted for the last annual meeting.
In addition, there are more restrictions
concerning how frequently a proxy resolu-
tion can be submitted, etc.

Presentation oi proxy resolutions relies
heavily upon student research and draf-
ting. We must draft responsible and cogent
presentation which reflect the degree of
our concern. Proxy submission deadlines
are iast approaching, so we have little
time to prepare. Therefore, we ask for
your help If you are interested in resear-
ching, please contact Laura Heller or
come to our next meeting Tuesday at 7
pm. in the coffeehouse.

It is up to die students to initiate proxy
resolutions and to continue to Show cone
cern for the South African situation. If the
trustees' recent breakthrough is ignored,
then it is sure to be rescmded and the
privileged channels that we have iought so
hard for will atrophy and disappear. —
Sincerely, Julie Bellisario, member oi
SASG .. ’ - . .

Recruiter response

To the Editor:

This letter is in response to the protest
against the Marine recruiter who was in
the Forum Wednesday.

The defense buildup that we are now ex-
periencing in this country is, in my opi-
nion, ludicrous, At the expense of social
programs we are building an arsenal of
such magnitude that . it threatens to
destroy us rather than protect us.
Something, such as arms reductions, must
save man from himself, but it is quite evi-
dent to me that at this particular point in
time we need some sort of military in de~
fend us (and I use that term to mean: pro
tect our borders from invasion),

Everyone in this country has the right to
protest ii they choose, but did
Wednesday’s protestors realize that the
recruiter was on campus because there is
no draft? I’m sure that the objections of
the protesters would have been even more
vehement in response to the reinstatment
of a draft where we would have no choice
but to join (or dodge). i have, myscli, mar-
ched on the Capitol in Washington several
times to protest the reinstatement of the
draft. It is the volunteer service alone that
stands between us and the draft. Personal
ly I’d much rather see a recruiter in the
Forum than a draft notice in the mail.
Next time, please let the recruiter do his
job! Your energies could be diverted to the
nuclear freeze movement, arms reduce
tions or other more constructive causes. —
Sincerely, David Mosher

B t} G incident

To the Editor:

This afternoon two 3&6 men came into
my room and informed me that they had to
do some maintenance work, 1, however,
was not informed of what was involved,
and I was given no advance warning. I had
been under the impression that 24 hours
notice was given to students when work
was gomg to be done in their rooms.

When I came back to the room after they
had left, i found that something or personal
value had been ruined. I hope that in the
future the students will be given adequate
notice and a specific explanation of what
will be done so that they can mke the
necessary precautions to protect their
belongings. 7 Sincerely, Julie A. Jones
