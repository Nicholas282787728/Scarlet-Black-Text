Reader Blasts
Exhibit Review

To the Editor’

I am writing in response to the
“Faculty Exhibit in Burling" artis
cle of April 15, 1938. I find this arti-
cle void oi critical expertise, and
object to the author's oiten
reckless language and his short-
sighted critique or the works on
display.

The author's vocabulary and
style reveal not only the inade-
quacy of his knowledge oi art and
aesthetic critimsm, but assault the
intelligence of his readers. The e'x~
amples or his rather inept
language abound, and none of the
artists presented are spared his
“baseballbat” style of criticism.
There is. for example, little that is
“almost postmodernist” about
Merle Zirkle‘s jewelry. Richard
Cervene’s abstractions have been
denigrated to the level of “a sort of
delicate, decorative prettiness.H
And needless to say, comment on
Karin Connelly's work has been
”safely" limited to two words:
“women's art."

In my opinion. however, the
author again lsee iilm reviews,
Jan. to April, 1988) destroys his
own credibility and competence
the most in hi comments on
Robert McKibbl s landscapes,
While barely admitting
McKibbln‘s superb technique, the
author inflicts the greatest
damage on himseli as he describes
the artist's work in terms of “,..the
cruder the mosaic, the better the
effect when viewed from far off."

Intentionally or not, this phrase
implies crudeness in McKibbin's
work 7 a comment insulting to
both the artist and the
viewer/reader. In addition, the
viewer can decide ror herselr at
what distance to stand irom the
work. The assault on our in
telligence continues. however, as
the author likens McKibbln’s style
or “[191605 commercialrart techni
que,” 0i another work, he claims.
“It is not so good up close...”

or course the author is entitled to
his opinions, as am i. i would sug
gest, however, that he reirain irom
publishi rig them until he develops a
more iinely tuned sensitivity to art
and art criticism, and concentrate
instead on making his readers
more iamiliar with the artists and
art events on campus and in town.

In trying to understand an
artist’s work, he could, ior exams
pie, actually talk with the artist.
He could also attempt to develop a
broader vocabulary oi criticism,
perhaps in his quest ior expertise,
he could begin by examining the
meaning oi the iollowing:
JARGON: (jar' gon) n.
...uniiitell‘ ible or meaningless
talk or writing: gibberish... a kind
oi speech abounding in uncommon
or uniamiliar words, and often
vague in meaning, iRandom
House Dictionaryt

The works on display iortunately
still speak ior themselves. Enjoy.

Berger Defends Actions

To the Editor:

We got just a few things to say:

1, Yeah, I'm sorry i feel sorry
for the psuedo-liberals that com-
plained about offensive music on
radio shows That's really
pathetic. Just turn the dial and
listen to something else, There’s
something to both please or oiicnd
anyone if you look hard enough,

2. The Bill and Dave letter was
poetic and l was almost brought to
tears, The eloquence, dignity, and
passion of their presentation of the
factswas unparalleled inaletter to
the editor.

3. “Offensiveness to women,
gays, Native Americans, and
blacks," That's absurd. And how
about Hispanics (a very large but
shameiully ignored ethnic groupl,
Jews, Filipinos. Czechoslavaklans.
and Peruvians’! By the omission of
these and other ethnic groups,
SP&R is perpetuating at least
apathy ii not discrimination
against these groups. They seem to
be saying either. “Who cares what
they think‘Y'Y or that they’re not
smart enough to be “victimized by
violent and offensive music and
comments," (Not too much hyper
bole here.)

4. If I said that I think the chang~
ing or indian sports teams is silly.

Crescent MOB of rushing the
stage, joining the hands. and pos-

it was great once. and even ap~
propriate; however, students in
their iun irenzies must recognize
that not every hand wants to share

request is that students use greater
discretion when the urge to invade

does that makes me antirNative
American? Or if I think that guilty
liberals participating in ex post
iacto revisionism accomplish very
little except stroking their own
sell-righteous egos? The Native
Americans got brutally and illegals
ly shafted, but I think it‘s more im-
portant to work for lands, educa-
tion, and jobs. not mascots Sure,
it’s not as glamorous or easy, but
it's a hell of a lot more substantive

which is fine. But as Bill and Dave
pointed out, outside the insulated
coziness of Grinnell College. these

non-traditional Views would not be
tolerated (just ask any gay about
the great people or Dubuque), and
that is a shame. Yet the closed-
mindedness oi Grinnellians eager
to condemn any person who
doesn't adhere to the same rigid
ideology as themselves is just as
pitiful. I’d love to say that freedom
oi expression ior everyone, no mat
ter how oiiensive to community
standards, is a given. but i can't.

7. I think that closing the station
was a stupid, pointless overreacs
tion. The demogogic language or
their letter was also absurd Who
was SPkR worried about? I think
they took the Coward’s way out in ‘7
this whole deal. Particularly, this
was Bill and Dave’s first reported
offense. and they should have been
warned and suspended temporari»
ly, not permanently. Clearly. they
were used as a political football As
for myself, Iused one of the FCC’S
seven dirty words. so fine, boot me

regulations are oppressive and
stupidly inhibit free speech.

To the Editor:

Like many other members oi the
college community, 1 am distress
ed by the events which led to the
suspension of KDIC last Week. The
letter or explanation submitted by
David Stelnman and Bill Collins
heightened my concern, because
its tone is deiensive and mocking.
They did not. see this as an oppor-
tunity to show any regret ior their
actions; rather, they stood by their
”right" to Voice their opinions on
the air, regardless oi the number
oi people who were oiiended.

I am especially troubled by their
contention that since their music
and comments “offended only
women,” |t was uniair that they
were critimzed. This idea is
dangerous because it marginalizes
women’s voice on this campus
They imply that no men were oi-
landed, and even neglect to men
tion that there was a male caller.
Of course, this fact undermines the
statement that “women are too
weak to understand what it's all
about.” Even ii a poll consisting oi
six phone calls logically leads to
this conclusion, I submit that as a
woman, I feel i possess the
rudimentary ability to ”unders-
tand” material which is explicitly
offensive I would even Venture to

 

say that it is precisely this ability

Student Feels Sexism

which allows me to be oiiended by
it, , . 4,

For iour years iharc listened do
students with “differing views" ac-
cuse Grinnell's “knee-jerk
liberalism" or suppressing and
denigrating .heir opinions, in some
cases I believe this is a valid
criticism, but Collins and stein
man use it as a crutch to deny the
legitimate complaints against
them and to trivialize the explicit
sexism in their rebuttal.

As one who is committed to,
iighting racism and sexism. i do
not ieel that calling sexist opinions
to the attention or the oiienders
constitutes a kneerjerk reaction. 1
consider it my responsibility to
coniront such situations Further
more. disc jockeys do not
necessarily have an inalienable
right to voice oppressive opinions
over the airwaves. The First
Amendment does protect ireedom
oi expression. but sometimes we
check ourselves so as not to in-
terfere with others‘ pursuit of hai».
piness. Even it it means humbling
themselves just a little bit. Collins. ,i
and steinman need to recognize
that what they did ignored this
responsibility and hurt some of us
in the process. — Alice Oldiathcr
