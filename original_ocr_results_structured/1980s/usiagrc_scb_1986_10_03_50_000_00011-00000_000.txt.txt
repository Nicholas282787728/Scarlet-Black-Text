Sinks VGrinnell

The Grinnell football team’s hopes for an
undefeated season were dashed by Lake
Forest Saturday. Big mistakes cost the
Pioneers, Lake Forest scored all their
points on big plays that resulted from
Pioneer mental mistakes : The‘Grinnell of-
fense didn't make things any easier on
themselves, fumbling several times. Two
of those fumbles led directly to Lake
Forest touchdowns on the ensuing series.
The defense was burned three times by the
exact same play. The play was a draw play
designed to take advantage oi an over ag-
gressive deiense that was ilowing to the
ball. Also. Lake Forest Capitalized on a
long pass for a touchdown only seconds
before the first half ended

However, things were not all bad for
Grjnnell. In spite of these errors, the
Pioneers were still in the game until the
end. This is no small feat against a Lake
Forest team that placed second in the
Midwest Conference Northern Division. In
fact. Griiinell held their own with the
Foresters (Conservationists?) who were
no doubt expecting an easy victory, It is
probably safe to say that Lake Forest “got
the breaks” which allowed them to get out
oi the Grin-city with a win,

On a more positive note lor the Pioneers.
a good periormance was turned in by Jim
Weiand at quarterback who was lilling in
for the injured Rob Lough. Weland threw
two touchdown passes and pei-iormed well
under a heavy pass rush for the majority
of the afternoon The offensive line did a
good job on most running plays and the
deleiisive line. with the exception oi three
long runs. kept the Lake Forest rushing
game under wraps most oi the atternoon.

Coach Martinek summed up the game
saying. “Wejust can‘t make thatmany big
mistakes and expect to win the game
against this caliber or opposition."

This week the Pioneers take on the Jolly
Green Giants of St. Norbert College at
Green Bay Wisconsin. St. Norbert won
conterence last ‘year, tying Coe in the
championship game. Despite an 073 start.
St. Norbert is again strong this year. “St.
Norbert is without a doubt one of the best
073 division lll football teams in the coun»
try." said Coach Martinek They have a
strong passing game. which could spell
trouble for the Pioneers unless they can
control the ball on offense and keep it out
ol the hands of the St. Norberl offense.
Another key for Grinnell will be to not give
up the big play. For, any fans planning to
make the trip the game starts at i .

in her best race of the season, took 5th
place in 20:34, Blair Davison and Heather
Lauver completed Grinnell's scoring at
the 34m and 44th positions, respectively.

“I hadn't expected the team to run as
well as they did,” Said Freeman, “We
have been working on keeping an even
pace throughout the race, and this was the
first week where the mile splits were about
even.” She cited Shearn as having “par-
ticularly impressive mile splits” and noted
that Mary Lanaghan rnd Marianne
Carlson ran well and are challenging to
make the top seven.
