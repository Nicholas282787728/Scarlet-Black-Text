In the aftermath of

“Guiltiest”

In the past week, the Rosenﬁeld Sylrtv
paiiurn on Poverty and Homelessness
prelznled Mitch Snyder as an expert
witness to the tragedy of American
homelessness. Speaking to hundreds in
Herrick Chapel, Snyder testified to the
horrible conditions of the homeless in
an effort to raise the social can.
sciousness of a predominantly white,
middle—clan college student body. In
his effort to raise consciousness, Snyder
told horrifying stories of the pain, suf—
fering, and death of people lieing in in-
human conditions. Yet in his efforts to
communicate his concerns, Snyder laid
guilt on a student body that it
oulnerable to feeling guilty for the
social'problenis of America.

Perhaps tlo one moment ' better
manifested this college's desire to feel
guilty for the problems ofAmerica than
the standing ovation Mitch Snyder
rcceiued for a speech in which he
directed all Grinnell College students to
drop out afichool. take a new ofpoverv
ly, and commit their lives to working
for a “jun" society. Indeed, it is dif-
ficult to believe that any of those
students who were standing and up.
plauding Snyder were actually going to
follow his righteous calL But more than
Snyder's righteous call, what Crin-
neltiani were applauding was their
feeling of guilt. In less than sixty
minutes, Snyder watt able to transform
a room of very comfortable bourgeois
American: into an applauding mass of
self-indulgent guilt.

toeiety “demonic," a society from
which they have beneﬁted greatly, it

stupidity in agreeing to write a column tor
the s it is. Apart lrom all paranoid [an
tasies I have one basic problem: what the
hell am I going to say" As oi last Thurs-
day, I had planned to write about the lack
ot gynecological care in Grinnell I wanted
to write a scathing and intelligent de~
nouncement oi the shame and ignorance
surrounding women's bodies. and of the
paternalism and condescensxbn exhibited
by the college towards women. In other
words. I wanted to use this column as a
soap box

However. now that I'm actually writing
this. I can't quite bring mysell to preach.
Preaching and dogma allow no room ior
uncertainty. While I am completely cer-
taln that there is a need tor some sort of
gynecological health care on this campus.
I admit that I am somewhat uncomforr
tablc discussing gynecological care except
in the most detached and objective way
To be candid. I'm not sure that I would use

hate gynecological exams. Although i
know that I should have regular exams.
my real prcierencc is to wait until there's

the self—indulgent college students who
can admit that the “demonic
American society is something they
really don’t want to abandon, or is it
Snyder’s cheap rhetorical style that
plays on middle-class guilt to raise con-
sciousness . rather evoking the true
awareneu of human compassion that
transcends all dado-economic class"?
The answer to this question may, in
fact, be moot, for guilt is, perhaps, the
most meleu emotion.

In Herrick on Tuesday night, Mitch
Snyder’s objective was to get Grinnell
students to make a commitment to
changing a society that

Snyder’s ipeeeh gained many short.
term concern, but by eoohing middle
class guilt, which only lasts until the in-
dividual alleviates that guilt, Snyder
had far fewer long-term commitments.
Snyder would agree that the problems
of homelessness in the United States
cannot be solved by short-term or tren-
dy commitments,- yet, he left most peo-
ple in Herrick Chapel with a lot ofgiiilt
and a seemingly improbable propell-
liorl to “drop oul"of the system. And as
for the students, they were too willing
to feel aelf-indulgently guilty and not
strong enough to remain seated and
resist Snyder’s emotional manipula
lion. ,

What is now left in the aftermath for

are we going to do about homelessness
in America?

Nonetheless, I know that my lcclings are
not unusual; they are in fact the norm.

Why do so many women [eel uncomlor-

a lot of moral implications involved in the
issue at gynecological care. or course.
there is the issue of abortion and birth Con-
trol. But what about a woman who simply
wants an exam? Really. a gynecological
exam shouldn‘t involve any more embarr
rassment than does my physical exam.
However, the attitude towards
gynecological care. unlike that towards
general health care. usually seems to be

The Human Element

“You’re too serious Duncan," I’ve been
told lately. ”Lighten up a little!"

To me. that translates into Smut.

Shuiiling through the bedroom doorway
in her iurry white slippers, the alarms
harsh buzz still Settling In her skull,
Kamryn Chist looked down at the beaten
burgundy shag. “We need new carpet,"
she thought vaguely and hall-asleep, Open-
tocd slipper heels slapped the bathroom
tiles as the 28 year old woman beerlined for
the shower. The soft terrycloth robe, also
white, slipped down her naked shoulders
and was casually tossed onto the erect
wooden peg jutting train the wall. She
paused for a moment in front of the mir-
ror, inspecting the hourglass protile at her
body. Her eyes rose rrom shapely legs to
firm buttocks, a taut belly, and wellr
lormed breasts. “Not bad if I do say so
myself," she thought, continuing toward
the shower. The frosty glass shower door
hissed open and Kathryn, kicking oil the
warm iurrys, careiully stepped in. Her
hands turned the shiny handles, and tor a
sharp second [rigid water bit her Skin. The
temperature warmed a little and Kathryn
spun the hot almost to its maximum, the
way she liked it. The hot spray'enveloped

her.

What seemed like minutes later, Paul's
chiding voice iloated through the billowing
steam and shocked her awake again.
“Jeez, Kate! You‘ve been in there thirty
minutes already and it's like a sauna out
here! ” he reprimanded. Kathryn shut off
the flow and stood on tiptoes, poking her
head out above the glass.

“Will you hand me that towel over
there?” A glistening arm pointed to the
rack. The silver Wedding band encircling
the third linger on the outstretched hand
glistencd dully.

“This one?” the male voice asked
without a trace of uncertainty. Kathryn‘s
loreiinger tlicked impatiently, pointing
again. ”Sorry. I can‘t reach it tor you.”
His mirth was unmistakeable. He loved to
torment her in little ways like this.

“Oh, hell.” she said under her breath.
With her best “eat shit" look pasted across
her face, she forced the door open and
gingerly stepped out, -dripping. Strong
arms encircled her waist and she yelped,
startled. He chuckled.

They made love with the water beating
down around them. The hot was cranked
way up, just the way she liked it.
