College ignoring

resources by not

video taping

Ever wonder how the college records lectures and discussions by
prominent speakers on campus? Except for some tape recording, it
doesn’t. The information imparted during lectures, panel discussions,
colloquiums, debates, etc. is lost to all but those people who were
there at the time.

, If these events were videotaped they could be used as course
material. Lectures by Julian Bond, Andrew Young, Kingman
Brewster and Viktor Lishchenko, who have all spoken at Grinnell dur-
ing the past three years, could be used in political science, economics,
American studies, history and several other courses A videotape ar-
chive could be started for professors and students to use now and in
the future.

Some videotaping has been done in the past but the equipment the '

college has is so obsolete that it is impractical to use now. There are a
couple of cameras which are 15 to 16 years old and some reel to reel
tape decks, one of which is still used. There is also some second—hand
equipment, also relatively old, which has been used to make instruc-
tional materials in French.

The old equipment' is not portable so it would not be feasible. to use it

' to tape events around campus But there are new cameras and video
tape decks on the market now which are very easy to use, are com—
pact and weigh about eight pounds Although in the past the ad-
ministration discussed the cost of new equipment and found it pro-
hibitive, prices have actually decreased in the interval. Discussion
should be reopened' in light of the new situation.

A high quality color camera and deck can be had for $3, 000 and a
merely adequate set could cost as little as $1, 000 A camera and tape
deck are all that is needed to record the tapes. They can be shown on
any television. Tapes used to cost twice what they do now. This equip
ment is easy to use and students could be hired to tape lectures, etc.
as a campus job.

The life of a videotape is indefinite, It might start to wear-out after
10 years, maybe. And if it does it can be rerecorded onto another tape.

So American history teachers in, say, 1995, can show the tape of the'

Vietnam conference here this semester. These tapes could also be us-
ed as source material for student papers,

Grinnell is ignoring its most important primary source of material
by not recording its lecturers and conferences for future references.
The theater and physical education departments have machines to
record their own events but they have no mandate to cover general
college events, nor should they. The college, possibly college rela»
tions, ought to have its own equipment and its own system for recor-
ding material.
