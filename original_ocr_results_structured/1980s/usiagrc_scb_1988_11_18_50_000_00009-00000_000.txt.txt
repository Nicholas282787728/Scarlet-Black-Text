SCARLET AND BLACK

A Fork in the Pork

"Why are you a carnivore?”

The question was one I of—

ten asked friends of mine in high

school who frequented butcher

shops and collected steak knives.

It seemed like a fad to me, like

they were just doing it because
they thought it was cool.

But Carnivorism is not a

fad. It's not trivial. And if peo-

Andy Glueck

ple did itjust to be Cool, well.l
sure feel like a dope because they
fooled me pretty good.

In fact, there are many
meaningful reasons why one
would decide to eat only meat.
First there is the moral dimenr
sion. Far be it for me to preach,
but are any of you aware of the
deplotable conditions under which
fruits and vegetables are raised‘.7
As babies, they are immediately
stuffed into the earth. They grow
up crowded next to each ottter in
order to maximize profit. To
compound matters. the vegetables
are tied down to the ground mak-
ing it impossible for them to
tum around or tie down.

Once, when I was walking
outside of town through the corn
fields, I was physically wrenched
and morally appalled by the sight
of hundreds of corn stalks
writhing in the wind attempting
to shake themselves loose, their
feeble arms shaking as if begging
me to extricate them.

But this is not the worst of
it. Grapes, for example, are
forced to grow up inside a
wooden eager Their vines wind
through the bars woefully, like a
tiger pacing in the Bronx Zoo.
Potatoes, just because they hap-
pen to be uglier than their other
vegetable brothers and sisters, are
stuffed underneath the ground
completely. And tomatoes are
hung upside- down until all the
blood rushes to their heads and.
when they can no longer endure

ACLU letter

Continued from Page 7
mistaken belief that all things
must be "tolerated" and accepted
for what they are. But, is the
ACLU really tolerating pomog-
mphy? Or is the ACLU ignoring
pornography for what it is? Rea
fusing to pass judgment on
something is still a judgment.
Fancy mental rationalization
cannot remove one‘s responsibil-
ity for failing to take action

In closing, let me just say
that I think that the writers of
last week's letter were right to
point out that the ACLU does
have some redeeming qualities.
However, I think that these writ~
ers got too carried away by over-
reactionary election year pas-
sions. To make the ACLU out
to be some sort of "white knight"
is very misleading And, to imr
ply that the ACLU is always a
champion of Constitutional
rigth and freedoms is simply
wrong. Walt Junker-H

the pain, they hurl themselves
into the soil, preferring suicide to
such a slow, ignoble death. Out
of decorum I will refrain from
describing what happens to artir
chokes and squash.

To support these death
camps that we call "gardens and
farms" there has emerged an enr
u're technology of torture devices
that we call " garden implements."
You might even have seen these
weapons advertised on television.
To conceal their insidious funcv
tion, they are given harmless
names, such as "The Garden
Weasel;" a more appropriate
name might be "The Grim
Reaper,” And then there are nun
merous books with titles like
"How to Cultivate Your Garden."
Cultivate. my ass. A more apt
title might be,"Auschwitz in
Your Own Back Yard."

0n farms, perhaps the most
mechanized, inhuman systems of
herbivorous genocide, vegetabics‘
undignificd deaths support our
corrupt way of life. As if painful
death were not enough, we rub
their faces in their own servility
before slaughtering them. We
bury them in "fertilizer," which
scientists have recently discovered
is really nothing more than s H I
T. (What is known to the com-
mon man as dung.) Our hench-
men - livestock - "graze" the
death camps desiccating upon and
sometimes biting entire limbs
from any plant which might dare
to rebel.

Furthermore, biochemically
speaking, everyone knows plants
give us oxygen. And everyone
also knows we have polluted our
environment with underarm dc»
odorants which produce acid rain
that hurts lakes and stuff. Now
ponder for a moment A and I'll try
not to get too technical here -
what would happen if we stopped
killing vegetables. More vegeta-
bles means more oxygen. There
would be so much oxygen, that it
would fly up to the atmosphere,
find all those toxins and pollu-
tants, and kill them. Then the air

would be clean. And then we
could smoke more, can plenty of
meat, and forget all this carpool
crap.

But you might have noticcd
a fallacy in my argument that
you thought I was too dense to
realize: If we only eat meat, then
what will the meat cat. Well,
that's no problem. Thanks to
modern technology, there are
nutnerous synthetic foods that are
neither plant nor animal, Some
examples are: CheezAWiz.
Hormel Chili, Frozen Burritos,
or anything off the Longhorn's
"Mexican-Night" menu. If we
could massrproduce this food for
animals rather than humans (as
we should have done in the first
place) then we would not need to
butcher our greatest natural re
source: vegetables.

Although our ultimate goal
is the eventual elimination of
produce sections in supermarkets,
we have to start on a small scale,
Take, for example, Corny, a de-
vout vegetarian, who just can’t
set down that package of Tofu
while watching the tube. Fed up.
she finally decides to start with
eliminating turnips from her diet;
then comes eggplant; then
squash. Her friend T-bone buys
her a gun, teaches her how to
hunt - and before no time the two
of them don't even miss a
sidcdish of greenbeans with their
venison. For those of you afraid
of losing roughage in your diet,
there are many substitutes
including antlers and hooves.

If you are truly interested in
hopping aboard the carnivore
coalition, here are some books I
recommend: "Organic lnnards"
not only offers you creative
recipes but is also a veritable
lesson on the mammalian diges-
tive process; "My Favorite
Cuts," written by a real butcher's
butcher, is detailed yet perhaps a
tad too graphic for the weak-
stomached; Anti "La Foret En-
chantee du Pore" (The Enchanted
Pork Forest) has recently been
translated from the French.

. The Human
Element

An orange sun sinks into
the Iowa com stubble. The fall
bitterness of a late afternoon Wind
sweeps across the fields. A tight
pack of runners speeds lightly
down the country road. Their
minds are on the motion of the
run, the tilting of the roads, and
the driving surgc of the legs.

Their unity is built on stride

Jim Duncan

matched for stride, clouds of

breath hissed in the chill, and the
scnse of a com fortablc endurance,
knowing that the run could go on
to the next horizon.

A beaten pickup lurches
past the team. The old farmer
raises two ﬁngers from the stecrr
ing wheel in greeting, and dust
from the gravel road billows in
the wake of the truck's passage.
The temperature seems to drop
with the fading glow of its tail-
lights as the scarlet clouds deepen
to purple.

Summer training is imporr
tant for cross country runners.
Most hold down summer jobs
and run when they get the chance.
Most run alone.

Even the asphalt seemed to
sweat. I started off on my run at
noon, in the heat of the day at 95
degrees. Eight miles came and
went. I was parched when I re-
turned home and passed out on
the front lawn. It wasn't the first
time. When I first began run-
ning, I could endure half a mile.

Barely.
: it n:

Sure the scenery gets born
ing. Roads start to look familiar,
even when you haven‘t run them.
That's why the teams run through
WaIrMart.

It's a wondrous sight, 3
pack of runners in sleek tights
entering a department store,
prancing like a herd of nervous
purebrcds ready to take off run
ning at the gate.

We jumped the gun in the
shoe department and gradually
wound our way through the aisles
of albums, appliances, toys,
cosmetics, and finally, gardening
tools. Management caught up to
us at the door. An agitated,
frumpy woman stepped in front
of the lead runner with her hands
resting authoritatively on her
hips and said, "Please never ever
run through WalrMan again,"

Sure the scenery gets bor—
ing. Roads look familiar, espe-
cially if you've run them. But
there's always Hy-Vee.

Some wonder why the
men's and women's cross country
teams run for miles every day,
why we endeavor to run the dis.
lance faster and stronger. By
challenging the training, we
challenge ourselves. The test
does not lie in drawing the limits
of the "lunatic fringe," but in
pushing beyond it.

We run because we feel like
it.
