Theft is a fact of life and while we may
want to ignore it, it does happen here on
the Grinnell College campus.

Theits are especially frequent in the
library,

As most students know, there has been
an increase in the number of books that
leave library shelves not checked out.
While many of these books are returned to
the library, some are not, which causes
problems ior students as well as faculty.

According .to Jim Tederman, Vice»
President and Dean of Student Affairs,
“the loss of library books should be an im-
portant issue. The disappearance oi a book
creates problems because it leaves some
students and faculty without access to
resources that should be available to
them". Tederman mentioned that he per-
sonally would like to see a security system
installed and while some library personnel
may not be happy with it. the general feelr
ing among students and iaculty is positive.

Gerald LaLonde. Professor of Classical
and East Asian Languages and a member
of the Library and Bookstore committee,
gave an update on the security system
decision, As of right now. the Committee is
going to monitor the statistics of book
disappearances. and at the .end oi the
semester. if there is no noticeable im-
provement. then the Committee will
recommend that a security system be in-
stalled,

LaLonde also mentioned the occurrence
of books being taken from a room on the
third floor of ARH. He states that it is often
hard to keep track of all the books that are
present because no regular inventory is
taken of the contents of the room.
However, he did report that a copy oi
Sculpture and Sculptor's of the Greeks was
taken. in addition. a copy oi the Oxford
English Dictionary disappeared recently.

Currently, the room is leit open so that
students can use the room to study or to
look at the books, Lalonde emphasized that
though such occurrences in the room have
been relatively small. the room will be
locked up if necessary.

Another area oi the campus that is
susceptible to theft is the PEC. Ron
Cooper, Assistant Cage Manager oi the
PEG. stated that most thefts that occur are
isolated incidents that are usually not
related. Cooper did mention that there has
been a decline in the number of thefts from
previous years; in terms oi who has lost
items to thieves, the number oi townspeor
pie is about the same as the number of cola
lege students.

the years, Cooper stated that the most
common items taken are usually wallets
or billfolds and jewelry He also noted that,
on occasion, people have walked out with
equipment that someone else checked out.

“Quite often," he added, “people are the
victims oi carelessness They either leave
valuables someplace and forget where
they put them or simply do not put locks on
their lockers." As to what people can do to
prevent theit. Cooper suggested that peor
ple should be a little more careiul; they
should guard their valuables by locking
their lockers or should simply not bring
anything especially valuable with them

One other area that is, and always has
been susceptible to theft. are the dorms
According to Tederman, theft has not been
a major problem in the past few years.
“Grinnell is lucky to not have a large theft
problem, because we have an open dorm
policy and most students are not in the
habit of locking their dorm rooms. There
was one small reported incident of a dorm
breakrin over Christmas break, and that is
the iirst tune that has happened in quite a
few years."

Tederman was quick to point out
however, that the college does not insure
dorm rooms. Most students. he heels. are
not aware of whether their belongings are
insured on a parent's policy and should
check this out before coming to Grinnell.

This year. there have been almost no
reports or theits in the dorms Tedermaii
stated that most students do not report
thefts because 1) they feel that taking a
few items wasn't any big deal. and 2t that
the Student Affairs Office can‘t really do
anything about it.

The latter point is somewhat true; usual-
ly. items are not found However, if more
students would report incidents, Student
Aiiairs could possibly determine a pattern
of time and location.

Finally. Tederman observed. that while
certain occasions oi local tecnagers hang
ing around dorms and trying to gel in can
be a source oi the problem, more serious
problems occur when students are stealing
from students.

A common occurrence of this is finding
iood missing irom iloor or dorm
refrigerators. or items being stolen from
lounges, Tederman suggests that students
should be aware of unfamiliar people
loitering about the campus. as well as be-
ing more careful about leaving their doors
unlocked. especially ii they know that they
have a lot of valuable items,

S Referendums to go

before campus soon

by Todd Francis

The iirst semester of the 198586 school
year passed without a single reierendum
coming to the student body. but that period
of apathy is over. The Committee on Stua
dent Politics (CSP), in charge or planning
reierenda. expects an issue to come up ior
a vote on the first referendum of the
semester. to be held next Wednesday,
February 26.

The process ior proposing a referendum
begins With bringing ideas ior resolutions
to CSP, which then helps iinalize the pres
posal. Then the proposal sponsor must coir
lect two hundred signatures to show that
students want the issue to come up to a
vote. Next, a iorum takes place where the
sponsor answers questions regarding the
proposal. Finally, the referendum is held.
ii a proposal passes, the results are sent to
officials that CS? and the sponsor feel
should receive news of the vote.

The proposal that students will vote on
Wednesday was initiated by several
members of Students to End Apartheid
(SEA), SEA is a campus organization
working to establish scholarships to bring
black South African students to Grinnell.
The proposal cites the authority oi the stu
dent body to use Student Government
Association (SGA) funds as it wants, and if
it passes will request that £1 50 per student
who votes in iavor oi the proposal be
donated to the scholarship SEA is
establishing.

Sponsors oi the proposal have already

collected 261 signatures of students who
want the issue to come to a referendum. If
the proposal does pass, the sponsors want
the results sent to the trustees and to other
ACM schools to demonstrate that students
can take an active part in allocating stu
dent funds. Politicians at the local. state.
and national level will also receive news of
the results.

Even lf the proposal does pass, however,
one possible barrier to the money being
given to the scholarship is the legality of
such an action State law declares that stuv
dent activity fees cannot be given to
charities. According to Phil Cantor, one of
the proposal's sponsors, using SGA iunds
from sources other than student activity
fees for the scholarship is legal. but com-
plications may arise since all of SGA'S
funds are in the same account,

More recent developments include a let
ter from President George Drake stating
that none of the SGA funds can be used for
such a purpose. Regardless oi whether the
money is actually donated. however. Can-
tor points out that ii the proposal passes
Grinnell College will be making a state
ment about the issue

To help educate students on this issue.
and to clarity any questions. CSP plans to
hold a iorum next Monday, February 24. in
the Coffeehouse. Two days later the vote
will be held. To pass the proposal. a ma
~iority oi the students voting must vote
‘ycs'. and at least twentyrfive percent oi
all Grinnell College students mustapprove
the proposal. '
