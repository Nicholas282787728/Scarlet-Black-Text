Buffer Days-
A
Learning Experience

With finals beginning in two days, it somehow seems fitting to com»
ment on the academic pressure some students might be feeling about
now, or rather the more important accompanying issue — buffer days.

The events of the past months prove that the administration and facul-
ty remain unconvinced a need or desire for additional buffer days exists.
One professor was quoted as saying, “Many students whom -I know and
speak to do not give me the impression that this (buffer days) is the bur-
ning issue of their time.” (55:13, Oct, 29, 1982). Such an attitude makes
the prospect of an additional buffer day in the near future seem rather
dim.

But imagine for a moment what one more buffer day would mean to a
student. It would mean increasing the amount of time for preparation
between the last day of classes and the first days of finals by one third.
One more day equals one third more study time. A rather large propor-
tion for such a little amount of time.

But let’s break it down even further. Let us say that the average Grin-
nell student taking 16 credits studies 12 hours a day during buffer days.

That translates to roughtly three hours per class per day, for a total of‘

six hours per class. But with one more day, a student could get in an ex-
tra three hours per class for nine hours total. Enough time to possibly
make a considerable difference in the level of their performance.

Okay, maybe the addition of one day won‘t make a difference for all
students; some students will still procrastinate, some will never have
enough time. But if thought of in terms of a one—third increase, the addi-
tion of one day seems more significant

Anyone who has even taken a college course, or any class, knows what
it means to finally synthesize all the material, put it into some signifi-
cant context and be able to say “Yes, I see it. I understand.” Isn’t that
the type of experience we all strive for in our learning process?

Do not get the impression that students are wallowing in self-pity over
the lack of one more buffer day. We pay a great deal of money to
undergo this educaitonal experience and if we didn‘t relish it we pro-
bably wouldn’t be here. Being the type of students we are, at this type of
academic institution, we’ll all make it through finals, as usual. We‘ll feel
the tension, the pressure, the panic which would probably exist whether
we had three days or three weeks.

But seeing another set of finals pass by does not erase the incidents of
the past semester.

It does not erase the fact that the Committee of Academic Standing
essentially shelved a specific, reasonable request from students
because of a problem with dates. Though other options to relieve
academic pressure have been suggested, they are a means of com-
promise — a compromise on an educational experience.

This lack of action is not to imply that the “powers that be” are not
concerned with the amount of academic pressure at Grinnell. They just
aren’t concerned enough to have assured the placement of a third buffer
day on the schedule when the next six-year calendar was being planned.
They aren’t concerned enough to find out if students really do need and
want buffer days. They aren’t concerned enough to take immediate ac-
tion, or any action, even is it is only a temporary solution to this pro-
blem.

It is a sad commentary on Grinnell College that the administration ig-
nored a request from the students to help them better do what they are
here to do ~ learn.

About this time each semester most
students anxiously await the end and going

The route I travel most often is the Seat- '

Civil Disobedience:
A proper means
bf change

To the Editor:

Last Thursday, Dec. 2, a good friend,
who is resisting draft registration here in
Iowa, called me to inform me that our
friend Gary Eklund had been sentenced
to two years in prison for failing to register
for the draft. Two other friends of ours are
now serving six month jail terms for civil
disobedience at the Strategic Air Comr
mand (S.A.C.) base in Omaha. They and
we were protesting the nuclear arms race;
on the same day I received a letter inform-
ing me that I and nine others are to be
sentenced on the 14th of Uiis month for our
actions at S.A.C, I have hesitated to be
vocal about my own civil disobedience.
But inspired by those who are 7 or will be
— imprisoned for their acts of conscience
and by the apprehension I feel about my
own sentencing, I feel compelled to share
my View of civil disobedience.

The reason I have hesitated to call atten-
tion to my civil disobedience is that I simp-
ly do not believe that civil disobedience
should be seen as anything particularly
special or courageous. Civil disobedience
is a necessary part of the life of almost
everyone who lives according to die dic-
tates of his/her conscience. I have decided
to write then, not because I believe what
my friends and I have done is something
exceptional, but because I want it to be
seen as a usual, ordinary, necessary part
of our people‘s lives.

My iirst reaction to my friend’s phone
call was probably quite typical. l
wondered why the government imprisons
my friends for following their consciences
when it allows to remain free people who
give little thought to the arms race, all of
the young men who have registered, and
most of those who haven't. But then I
remembered something very important 7
something that probably inspires or at
least encourages most civil disobedience.
That is, through civil disobedience we
fulfill the responsibilities that each of us

to one thing and one thing only: a three day
hard on (On a Greyhound one develops
very low threshold for excitement.)

The next pleasure diversion is the 2 am
mambo. The shrieking four-year-old ha<
iinally quieted down, you have become ex
hausted enough to sleep when all the light
go on. the bus comes to a stop in Missoula
Montana, ’or some other garden spot
and evcryonc is torcibly ejected from the
bus to drink coffee for 45 minutes an-
mambo. While all this is going on your ho

has —‘ in this case, the responsibility tor
peace. We must deal with the responsibili-
ty for peace personally, because, after all,
it is personal and should not be given over
to the Pentagon as quickly and with as lit
tle thought as itis in most cases. By taking
personal responsibility by refusing to en.
courage through silence what We believe is
immoral, we necessarily become more
free — even tlwugli,‘ like my friends, we
may be imprisoned. The ideas of freedom
and responsibility seem very grand and
abstract to most people. Certainly, they
may be grand. But I believe that those who
participate in civil disobedience
demonstrate that these ideas should not be
abstract. Indeed, the knowledge and the
exercise of our responsibilities needs to be
very familiar to us, as does the freedom
they bring about.

Those of us who protest at S.A.C. do not
really believe that our actions are going to
directly change the government‘s nuclear'
weapons policy, although we would of
course gladly accept any move towards
disarmament. We pursue the more pro»
mising, if perhaps slower, process of affec-
ting other people WiU'i our example, other
people who will, we hope. become respon
sible members of society. These people
can then join us in ending the silence that
allows the arms race to continue.

While it may seem to make little sense to
choose a method of change that may be
slower and require more of a struggle, I
believe that this method is the only truly
moral one left to us. Through it we act ac-
cording lo our consciences and not accor-
ding to the law which protects the produc»
tion and existence of nuclear weapons.
Civil disobedience also allows us to work to
eliminate nuclear weapons while we
demonstrate that we do not share in 50cm.
ty’s approval or tolerance of them, In my
opinion, this course is much more accep-
table than to support, through silence or
through taxes, the Pentagon or the promo
tor oi peace, We cannot accept the
idealistic hope that Ronald Reagan will not
engage us in a nuclear war.

Civil disobedience is a proper, realistic
and also very ordinary means of change.
At times, it is also the only moral response
we can give. I am certain that, as such, my
civil disobedience, and that of my friends,
is positive. ND matter how small its ap-
parent effect, I believe it is the right thing
