By now we all know that all the cool pear
ple live olt-campus. Broad Street is the
coolest place to live, though High Street is
pretty cool too (which isn't to say it’s un-
cool to get high on Broad street), But you
probably want to know what makes us cool
people so cool?

For one thing; off-campus tood is pretty
cool, and on-campus load is distinctively
uncool, Off~campus people go shopping at
the grocery store just like grown-ups. We
buy whatever we want and for a lot less
money than McConnell’s food. We buy cool
organic foods like tofu and no»salt peanut
butter and cool popculture toods like Cap-
tian Crush, Diet Coke, and E.T, Gum.

Then we eat it whenever we want. We

wake up long after Food Service has closed
and have bacon and eggs for breakfast.
And its better than McConnel's breakfast,
not to mention a lot cooler.

There is no apparent casual relationship
between coolness and culinary talents,
hence the meals shared by oft-campus peer
ple range from peanut butter and crackers
to rancy Italian pastas and Indian curries.
A iavorite intermediate is Fareway ham
with swiss on toast Cottage Bread (don't
forget the Grey Poupon). Other off~
campuis standards include Ramen
Noodles, Campbell's Tomato Soup, tuna.
and Stone Ground Wheat Thins.

Another of the cooler features of off
campus lile is its privacy. Nearly

Leases and landlords

by Ellen Headi

Alter break the search for oftcampus
housing will begin. Not everyone knows
how to go about getting an apartment or
how to handle a lease. Vice president and
Dean of Student Affairs James Tederman
emphasized that students first need per
mission to live oftcampus and should not
commit themselves to an apartment
without checking with Student Affairs,
When they do go to the Student Attairs ore
lice, prospective renters are given a list or
tenant information.

Apartments can be located by word of
mouth, in newspapers, or on bulletin board
advertisements Toward the end of the
semester Student Affairs also may have a
list of available units. When looking at
apartments students should make a list of
the condition of the rooms and furniture,
At the end of the lease period the checklist
can be used to insure getting back the en
trie deposit.

Tederman stressed the importance of
the written lease over the oral one because
it providu more protection for the ten nt.
A written lease should include the date it
was signed, the tenants and landlord's
names, a description of the property, the
date of occupation and termination, the
amount of rent and where it will be payed,
what specific responsibilities the tenant
has (such as snow shoveling or lawn cut
ting), an access clause, a clause which
tells who is responsible for utitlity and
other bills, a list of what the landlord is
responsible for fixing, a smtement about
the security deposit, and a clause on
sublettlng.

Oral leases are as binding as written
ones but are more difficult to prove and
may not stand up in court. Both parties
have less protection because oral leases
may be vague as to the rights and respon-
sibilities of the landlord and the tenant.

everyone has their own room, it not their
own apartment, Anyone who has had a
roomate knows how cool this is. Further-
more, most or the apartment has some
degree of intrinsic coolness in that they are
in beautiful old wood houses with real tur-
niture and real windows (and lousy plumb
ingt, Maybe even somebody really cool liv»
ed there last year. And since cool people
know how to be mellow (Mellowness
Theorem: Corollary III), we are rarely
disturbed by the kind of uncool noise that
oncampus people make in the dorms.
Privacy is essential because it allows us to
see to our uncool necessities (like study
ing) Without anyone knowing about it,

Probably the coolest things we do off-
campus is have citcampus parties. In
fact, oftcampus parties sometimes are so
cool that visitors find the atmosphere un»
comlortably cold. Cool people, of course,
like it that Way.

All this is really only a small part of
what makes offcampus like so cool.
There‘s lots of other cool things we do: we
hang out at the forum and the pub a lot
more than (in-campus people (we know
they’re good places to find more cool peo-
ple). We bounce cur rent checks and cams
plain about the heat and the plumbing
which never seems to work quite right,
even in the coolest apartments. We get
dogs and name them “Dooliie” or
“Bonghit” and put bandanas around their
necks .. Damn, are we cool! !l

There is a story told that a student once
said that offrcampus people aren't really
cool at all. “They only think they're cool,”
he said, “But i am cool and they’re not,"
The [001's wrong of course; anyone who
was really cool wouldn’t go around saying
so.

know your rights

Upon termination of a lease the landlord
must return the tenant’s deposit within 30
days or present a written statement telling
why he or she is withholding it, Legitimate
reasons tor keeping the deposit include un-
paid rent, repairing any damage done by
the tenant, or paying any expenses of evice
ting a tenant who did not leave the apartr
ment when required.

According to the fact sheet, “a tenant’s
responsibility are to uphold the lease, take
care oi the apartment, pay rent on time
when the lease expires." If a tenant does
not fulfill his or her responsibilities the
landlord may withhold the deposit or ter-
minate the lease. The landlord must send a
written notice of intent to terminate a
lease at least 30 days before he doﬁ so, If
the tenant corrects the violation within 14
days oi receiving the notice the lease can-
not be terminated

Landlords

give students

good reviews

by Nancy L. Radermecher

Late rent checks, vandalized apartr
ments, uncooperative tenantseis this the
plight oi Grinnell landlords? Apparently
not at least as tar as college students are
concerned. in fact, it seems that Grinnell
students have been passing Real World
101: Apartment Living with flying colors
for years.

“As far as I’m concerned, the studenw
I've had have been terrific”, stated
landlord Sandy Juhl. ”I really like my
kids,” she added. Wilbur Eyestone,
another landlord, agrees ”I like renting to
college sudents ..or I’d rent to other
folks,” Indeed, Juhl, who has rented to
“other folks," claimed that they were the
only tenanu she has been forced to evict.

Grinnell landlords also agree that there
hav'e traditionally been few problems with
late rent payments. According to
Eyestone, “College students pay their rent
as all (my) tenants do." While late rent
paymene can cause carsiderable pro-
blems for landlords, who themselves have
bills to pay, Juhl explained that itstudens
“come up short, they are nice enough to
call me."

Experiences among landlords have
varied with rupect to damage caused by
Students. While Eyestone “has never been
bothered by Vandalism by any students,"
some landlords believe students often fail
to call them soon enough when essential
repairs are needed in their apartments.
Landlady D. Douglas explained that
students should call immediately when
there are difficulties that they can't take
care of themselves." She cited snow
removal and broken doors and windows as
problems which should be attended to im~
mediately in order to insure the upkeep of
the apartments,

As for their relationships with college
students, most landlords find students
responsible and enjoyable. Eyestone, who
rents “to enough students to have a good
cross section," noted that today’s studean
are, “more serious, possibly about the
work they do, and their living quarters."
He further asserted that students are
"more reasonable now."

Juhl, who describes students as “really
decent people," has also maintaind good
rapport with her tenants over the years. “I
don’t bother them and they don't bother
me,“ she concluded.
