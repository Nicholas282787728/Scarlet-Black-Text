requirements was not entirely valid.

on the subject of lab requirements,
Parslow argued that “teaching science
without labs is like teaching a loreign
Ianugage using texts only in translation.”
He noted that most “real" science coursa
offered at Grinnell are lab courses. He
argued for a liberal interpretation of
laboratory to include such pursuits as col-
lecting field mice and looking at stars.

Finally Parslow argued against those
concerned about having only interested
students in classes by saying that students
currently enroll in courses for other
reasons than interest in the subject mat-
ter.

While agreeing wtrn the need [or more
structure, Professor of History Alan Jones
questioned the wisdom of adopting the pro-
posal without more information about
what changes would have to be made in
coursu and staff assignments. l-le ex-
pressed concern about the problems of
meeting the requirements when the size 0!
the teaching faculty was declining and the
trustees and administration had made no
commitment to “support the kind of ex-
perimentation that may be necessary.”

Student Ethan Cohen took issue with

volving science.

Professor lrving addressed the need for
coherence, interconnectedness and a sense
of community which the proposal adr
drsses, He expressed concern over the
number of course changes that take place.
He Viewed this as a fault of the advising
system and indicated that more advising
was taking place in the hallways of the
dorms than in faculty offices.

The final segment of the debate revolved
around the quality of advising. Professor
of Religious Studies Dennis Haas argued
that the faculty needs to take advising
more seriously, although he thought that
they had done rather well, noting that a 13
percent failure rate translated to an 37 per-
cent level of success.

Professor Christiansen responded, “I
classify all ideas that we should improve
faculty advising in the category of pious
hopes."

Monday's faculty meeting opened with a
brief statement from SGA Vice-President
Peter l-lautzinger urging rejection of the
proposal. Hautzinger argued that re-
quirements are likely to alter the composi-
tion of the student body. He said that the
current student body was a “pretty damn
intelligent” group.

Senior Mike Camroon argued for advis-

Parslow’s exclusion of non-lab science
courses. He noted that he was currently
enrolled in the “Historical Approach to
Physics” course, which is not a lab course.
He said that it was a valuable course and
should not be excluded from the science re
quirement.

Professor of English and American
Studies Donald Irving and Profssors of
Biology Kenneth Christiansen and Lenore
Durkee made statements in support of the
proposal. Christiansen said that the pro
posal was well thought out and should not
be significantly altered through amend~
merits but raﬂier voted up or down as iti

Professor Durkee agreed with Chris
tiansen and offered criticism of student
comments about the proposal compiled by
Peter Hautzinger. She countered die argu-
ment that students who are old enough to
vote should have the freedom to choose
courses by saying that she wondered if a
person who has not been exposed to the
sciences can vote intelligently on issues in-

S’ruden’rs against Parslow prOposal

by Jim Hunter

The SGA Ad-Hoc Curricular Committee
last Saturday published the results of its
student Curriculum Requirements
Survey. The poll indicated that a substan
tiai majority of students are opposed to the
Parslow Proposal or any set of re
quirements, but show moderate approval
for improvements in the tutorial and ad-
vising system. '

Two separate documents were
distributed to the faculty. One was a quan-
titative data summary.compiled by Com-
mitee Chairwoman Bernadette Connors.
The other document compiled by SGA
VicerPresident Peter Hautzinger was a
summary of some of the comments which
students included on the back of the ques-
tionnaire.

In the cover letter to the data summary,
Connors’ notes that the committee con—

ing and against requirements. “The advise
ing system is critical in helping students to
understand why a liberal education is im-
portant,” said Camroon. He pointed out
that requirements on a piece of paper
would not provide this understanding, and
that “a dvising shouldn’t be undermined by
requirements.”

Professor of English Elizabeth Dobbs
responded that she believed requirements
would improve ﬂ’le advising situation.
Rather than focussing on general
arguments about the importance of a
liberal education, professors would be able
to concentrate on the individual needs of
students.

Professor of History Philip Kintner
argued that discussion with students over
course selection is “part of the learning
process," and “central to the advising
system." He Said he wouldn’t see this tak-
ing place under a system of requirements.

The faculty adjourned. A vote on the pro-
posal on October 31 is a possibility, but not
a certainty.

suited with the psychology and sociology
departments to ensure a fair survey. The
all-campus survey received a response
rate of about so percent, almost equally
divided among the four class ranks.

president could get us so deeply involved
that we couldn't leave."

The question oi the legitimacy of the
Congressional Veto was also mentioned by
Hurwitz. Though the Supreme Court
declared the Congressional Veto of
presidential actions unconstitutional in a
decision this summer, it has not vet been
tested in the case of the War Powers Act.
“It is still up in the air,“ he said.

Associate Professor of Political Science
I-I. Wayne Moyer was also interviewed by
both KDIC and the SﬁrB. In the KDIC inter
view, Moyer agreed with Hurwitz and
stated that the “bomb blast in Lebanon
may have had an impact on this decision."
Moyer noted that Reagan does not want to
appear weak and indecisive in an election
year (as Carter did in 1980 because of the
hostage situation). Moyer said that the
world View of die Reagan administration
must be taken into account. He implied
that the Reagan administration may be
overly concerned with the Spread of Soviet
domination and influence. Mayer noted
that president Reagan actually said that
Nicaragua and the Soviet Union are “try-
ing to spread the virus of commurusrn” in
Grenada.

in the SSrB telephone interview, Moyer
also Commented that the action Will be an
enormous blow in “our propaganda cams
paign wrth Russia, in terms of world public
opinion.” He added, “To most Latin
American countries, this will be a sign of
American imperialism and American ag-
gression.”

Moyer believes that intervention will
have an adverse effect on the us. very
similar to the KAL»DO7 incldent’s effect on
the Soviet Union, Asked what impact U.S.
intervention in Grenada might have on
overall U.S.-Soviet relations, Moyer
responded, “Not very much. Deep down
the Soviets understand that the Western
hemisphere is our sphere of influence,
They acknowledge our right to take action.
in our sphere of influence.” He added,
however, that “if they want to get out of
the START talks, this will make it easier
on them."

Political Science instructor Neil Mitchell
said in me KDIC interview that no official
Soviet response has been made, though he
mentioned that Tass called the action
“armed banditry, a U.N, charter violation,
and a blow to peace." Mitchell quoted
Georgi Arbatov as saying Reagan is look»
ing {or a short and glorious war'.

In the SM} interview, Mitchell said that
the U.S. intervention is likely to alienate
Latin American countries. He cited
Venezuela, Mexico, and Costa Rica among
the nations mat have spoken out against
the action. Asked about Hie possibility of
Soviet retaliation in other areas, Mitchell
said it would be “highly unlikely," He said
that the Soviets would not take retaliatory
action because of the “propaganda advan-
tage which they would lose if they took ac
tion elsewhere.”

Mitchell also mentioned that Reagan
may have learned the lesson of Margaret
Thatcher’s glorious Falkland victory and
has tried to follow her example. Asked
whether the action was politically or
morally justifiable, Mitchell said that he
believed “none of die reasons [given by
the Reagan administration] are justifying
the options they've taken." He added, “My
own view is that there may be something
to the notion that this is a message to
Nicaragua and other regimes rauier than
the airport or ‘U.S. lives' excuses”

In the final segment of the KDIC broad-
cast, Senior Jim Bloyd read a prepared
statement and played taped student inter—
views. Commenting on the U S interven~
tion, Bloyd emphasized the U. . interests
in long range control of the markets, raw
materials, and cheap labor readily
available in Latin America. He also noted,
‘ ‘Ever since the Cuban revolution, Hie (1.5.
has made sure that any government that
threatens the interests of the rich and
favors progressive social change does not
hold power. in this way we allow the
Soviets to play the role of liberators, and
actually hurt our claims that we favor the
oppressed, that we favor democracy.”

Several students interviewed also critiz-
ed the action. One reaction was that “the
fact that they invaded is a bad move no
matter what the motive." Another student
noted that “Americans tend to stand
behind the president whenever he makes a
move like that," referring to the positive
public opinion about the action.

The most recent AP repors (as of
Thursday morning) indicated that there
were six Americans reported dead and 30
Cubans. According to the AP, about half of
the American students were home or
heading home. Also, government officials
in Washington are reportedly “taking
preliminary steps to set up a new govern-
ment." The report continues a new govern-

Small Caribbean island will be allowed to

The results, some of which are listed in a
table below, are somewhat ambiguous in
that they show strong resistance to any

system of requirements, but more
moderate views concerning particular re-
quirements. The most highly resisted re-
quirements are the lab science and social
science requirements.

Some important figures that do not ape
pear in the table are: 1) 89.4 percent said
no the the question, “Do you favor the pre
sent proposall”; 2) 76.3 percent said that
they did not see a need for any more re
quirements, and 3) 70.3 percent of the same
pie Cited minimal requirements as a
positive influence in choosing Grinnell,

in a series of questions asking whether
juniors and seniors would meet each re
quirement, the precentages ranged around
80 percent except in the areas of lab
science and foreign language, which were
close to 65 percent - - \
