Women's Center to open soon

by Meridith Levy

Iowa's Fall annually generates
many things: corn, pumpkins.
corn, new students. and corn.
The fall of 1988 has a new gift to
share with Grinnell: The Jeanne
Burkle Women's Center. At this
moment. people throughout
Grinnell‘s community offer their
hands and their support to see to
the opening of this new. women-
focused center. The grand Open;
ing should take place sometime
in the end of September.

The 'founders' and organizers
of this new center aim to create a
central location from which peo-
ple can gather information con
cerning women's issues and pro
grams. Their hopes for the center
include the ability to offer sup
port to women of all back-
grounds. to serve as a resource for
other programs and information.
and to respond to particular issues
by providing women with skills
and insight from guest speakers
and open discussions.

The idea to create a women's
center developed well over a year
ago; people have since given
their time and energy to convert
the idea into action. The fore—
mothers of the center originally
planned to focus on the Grinnell
College women and locate the
center on campus. They later
expanded the concept of a
women‘s center to include people
from the entire Grinnell commu-
nity. They hope to bring to

gether people of all ages. back-
grounds. and interests. Shirley
McKibben. the present head of
the program. has hopes of a cen-
ter that can encourage personal
growth and equality. while pro-
viding information for concerns
such as physical and mental
health of women. and many other
general issues.

The center should greatly in4
crease accessibility to other pro-
grams and opportunities offered
to the community concerning
women's issues. The center will
work to coordinate existing pro-
grams while contributing new
programs to the
community.

The organimtion has already
generated several inspiring talks
and workshops. Last year. their
topics of discussion and work-
shops included: “Male-Female
Communication: The Politics of
Talking", a workshop on self-de-
fense. "Career Options: Explor
ration and Planning". "Struggles
of Motherhood: Myths and
Realities", and "Parenting". Fu»
ture goals include an on-site
brown—bag lunch program in
which women could become ace
quainted with different issues
concerning various businesses
and organizations throughout
Grinnell. A small women's film
series focusing on women from
different backgrounds and loca-
tions around the world represents
another goal. The future agenda
for lectures and discussrons lnr
eludes possrblc topics as:
Women in History. Women in
Grinnell. Thc Superwoman Syn-
drome, Adult Children of AlC0'
lloiics. Latch-Key Children. How
to Deal with Aging Parents, as-
sertiveness training sessions. and
programs for new parents or re-
centiy divorced parents.

Center stands in the hettrt or

With regard to student
perception of the ﬁnancial aid of-
fice and its role. Lincoln had this
to say: "We are the good
guys...in that we don't collect
any money. We help you pay
your treasurcr's bill. We're like
kind of a friend on the side. Our
base function is providing finanr
cial resources. What happens.
tllough. is that if we don't have a
complete application. we can‘t
transfer money to the treasurer’s
office."

Lincoln stressed that the ul-
timatc responsibility for
completing FAF and related
forms lies with the students.
GCOSFA hopes to have aid
forms available for students in
December.

"We want to help. We air
ways want to get the money to
you as soon as we are able to. If
we don’t get the form we can‘t
help out, we can't help you solve
problems." he said.
