Tulis McCall. through her
character “Everywoman.” uses
careful historical research and
exciting theatre to portray a
group of exceptional women, go-
ing back to our founding fathers--
and mothers.

”If we don't know about our
pastas women, we have no future
as individuals," said McCall. Her
cast of characters includes such
luminous figures as Hetty Green,
Margaret Sanger, Harriet ’l‘ub-
man, Anne Hutchinson, and So-
journer Truth. McCall brings
these prominent women in
American history to liie in her
perlormances, creating a mosiac
oi memorable, faces-from-the-
past characters that illustrate
many of the venerable themes and
movements that have shaped the
course of women's history in
America.

Department of Dramatic Arts at
the University of Connecticut in
1973, Ms McCall joined the

Company. In 1974, she became a
selfsemployed performer and
created a show which embodied
her ideas of relevant and portable
theatre. She chose American
women as her subject, and a
search through the past for the
foundations of the present led to
the birth of “Everywoman.”

One reviewer wrote. “McCall,
simply put. was wonderful,
whether she was addressing the
crowd as ‘Everywoman,’ the nars
mm of the piece, or slipping into
the character oi one of history's
integral but forgotten women,
from Pilgrim Anne Hutchinson to
birth control pioneer Margaret
Sanger to activist Sojourner
Truth..."

McCall is a dynamic performer
who moves through history and
roles with a smooth aplomb. Not
only is McCall an adept actress,
but she is something oi a
philosopher as well. “Women to
day got a choice," McCall says,
“We can either take our
husband’s name or our father's
name." Or, looking back in time a
bit: “Some say Margaret Sanger
was a fanatic. I look at it like this:
if you're gonna take on the
Catholic Church. the medical pro-
fession and the law all at the same
tlme--bein‘ a fanatic could be con-
sidered an asseti" And finally:
“AS long as there are women.
there will be women's issues. In
fact, we are all women’s issue."

Due to a leg injury to one oi the cast members oi Arrabal’s “The Ar-
chitect and the Emperor oi Assyria,” the Theatre Department produc-
