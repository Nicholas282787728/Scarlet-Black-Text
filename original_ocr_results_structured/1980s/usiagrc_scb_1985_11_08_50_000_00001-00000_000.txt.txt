In his iirst address titled Reductngthe
Risk oi Nuclear War e Perceptions and
Misperceptions oi the Military hole oi
Nucleai Weapons McNamara asserted
that "nuclear weapons serve no military
purpose whatsoever ..except only to deter
one's opponent irom using them."

McNamara said argument about the
numbers at weaﬁns that each country
possesses. “whether we have 11,000 and
they have 10.000 and so iorth" is irrele-
vant. .“Within these ranges it makes ab-
solutely no diiierence.

useless But he also quoted others. in-

weapons. remains an important element in

McNamara proposed that three "con-

oi the military role or nuclear weapons exe

"can be used in a controlled or selective
way e that they have a \var~l'ighling role
in defense oi NATO nations."

The second view takes the opposite posi-
tion. said McNamara “Any use oi nuclear
iicapons by the U. . or the Soviet Union is
hkcly to load to uncontrolled cscaltion with
unacceptable damage to both
sides ,.therclorc. nuclear weapons have no
military use other than to deter iirst use or
