Student calls for support of Des
Moines homeless shelter

To the Editor'

On Saturday, April 11, Students Against
the Injustices of Homelessness will spon~
sor another ti‘lp t0 Des Moines, to the
homeless shelters run by the Kindred
Community. Patty MacDonnell, Kindred’s
director, came to Grinnell on Tuesday askr
ing for our support in a major petitioning
drive. She said that Grinnell's help is in-
valuable to the Community, as we are Kin-
dred's only major source of personpower.

The Kindred Community runs two
shelters for the 1on homeless people in
Des Moines and provides the only ab-
solutely free shelter available (other miss
sions charge from four to six dollars per
eveningl. Even so, Kindred only has room
to house approximately 65 of these lzoo
people. Recently, the City Council sent in»
spectors to the shelters, who deemed them
unsafe without the installation of a fire
escape, and said they would have to cut
their population down to ten. Further, they
would not be granted materials or permis-
sion to build the escape until the population
was reduced to ten, which would essentialr
ly put 55 homeless people back on the
streets. Kindred Community resisted
these measures and has been taken to
Court. .

The homeless people in the shelters,

along with the staff members of Kindred,
are asking the people of Des Memes to sup
port them in the form of a petition, which
opposes the actions of the City Council and
demands that no homeless people be
displaced without reasonable housing
alternatives. Our help is greatly needed lri
the petitioning drive, however. If each stu-
dent could donate one, JUST ONE, Satur-
day afternoon to the cause, we could be of
major help to the homeless ln Des Moines.

Anybody may participate, including
members of the iaculty and community.
No previous experience or knowledge ol
the issue is required. All you must do is
show up in the Forum Grill at 11:00 am. on
Saturday. We will provide transportation
and will get you back to campus by dinner-
time

Those who have been to the shelters and
participated in previous petitioning dnvﬁ
have found the experiene extremely
rewarding. Many were surprised at the
type of people mey met in the shelters and
claimed that the visit changed some of
dieir perceptions of homeless people in
general. I strongly encourage you to par-
ticipate, even if only once. Your help will
be greatly appreciated. 7 Laurie Duni~

Amann’s “right to privacy”

quesuoned

To the Editor:

Please consider the iollowing excerpt
lroin Ted Amann's column, “View from the
Throne," which appeared in the April 3
edition of the Scarlet and Black:

But more important, Marijuana
Prohibition should be dismantled
because it is immoral. The govern-
ment is legislating how adult, lax-
paying, U s. citizens can act IN THE
PRIVACY OF THEIR own
HOMES! In doing so, they are
violating our constitutional right to
privacy,

My knowledge or constitutional law is, I
admit, scant; so, I would like to impose
upon you to answer a question for me, it 1
capture Ted Amann, strangle him with dire
ty gym socks, douse him with sweet-and-
sour sauce, and set him on fire “IN THE
PRIVACY OF [MY] OWN [HOME]”, and if
I subsequently am arrested because our
country has laws against such activities, is
my “Constitutional right to privacy” being
violated?

Thank you for your attention to this mat-
ter. A Barbara Brown

Black hole of Calcutta or Gardner

Lounge?

To the Editor:
The major reason this college sponsors
parties is to allow students the time to
relax and wind down after a sometimes in
tense week of academics. Yet after ex-
periencing recent parties in the Black Hole
of Calcutta — oh, excuse me 7 Gardner
lounge, I'm sad to say this is no longer the
case. By cramming hundreds of students
into a room far too small. tension is
created rather than released. (Does the
phrase "Maximum Capacity” ring a bell?
It does for a fire marshall.) The constant
jostling, the inability to move, and a dance
floor so overcrowded that it is impossible
to do anything except get stepped on is
beginning to drive students away. It should
not take me five minutes to get from the
dance floor to the restroom. Believe me,
I've done it in less. I was going to talk to a
friend of mine over by the elevator, but I
realized the party was only 3 hours long
One of the reasons the administration
banned alcohol in Darby is that they didn't
like the idea of intoxicated students cross-
ing Eighth Ave Well, look what they are

doing now. They are all staggering back
from the Ear, Links and the Longhorn
regularly, slam dancing with the traffic on
Route 6, not to mention all the other streets
in town, We also have the added pleasure
or high school students (who seem to get
some perverse pleasure out of driving
about in circles every Friday and Satur-
day night (a behavior which would be of in
tercst to certain sociologists), aiming for
us,
This campus is crying out for a new
facility for major social activities where
students can move about lreely, dance and
be safe from oncoming traffic. I realize
such a project will take time to complete,
especially with so many with the power to
do it sitting on their hands, but until this
new facility is completed the ban on par
ties with alcohol in Darby must be
lifted , and lifted soon before the concept
old “good time” is lost at Grinnell Thank
God I'm a senior, 7 Nick Wright. SUA

View from the Outside

by Paul Draus

As the train shot into daylight, Ibegan to
experience the sinking realization that I
had missed my stop. The Sears Tower was
rapidly shrinking oil into the distance, and
as the southbound El sped onward
relentlessly, 1 began to teel very pale. A
Grinnell College sweatshirt and white skin
were not the ideal things to be wearing in
the heart of Chicago's South Side, I realiz-
ed. My stomach tightened as I began
whispering silently to the train. Train stop
train please stop so [can switch over and
head back dowtown where it's safe. Please
don’t let me die, not today.

I was scared.

Anyone who hasn’t ridden the El in
Chicago ought to. It is a unique experience.
1 suppose the subway system in New York
is similar, but I’ve never been there, so I
'don't know. I've ridden the El only a few
times, but if there’s one thing I've learned,
it‘s that if you don’t know the system, you
should be very careful when and where
you get on and get oil, because if you
aren't, you might end up someplace where
you don‘t want to be.

Which brings us back to me. I wasn‘t
sure exactly where I was headed, but I Was
pretty sure there weren’t any nice shoppe
ing malls there.

And although my fears were somewhat
exaggerated, I knew they weren’t unr
justified. I recalled the story my friend
told me about his uncle who, after a long
day of work downtown, had made the
mistake of falling asleep on the El, and
when he woke up, he was at the end of the
line. He knew instantly that he was in trou-
ble. He was lucky; he only had his money
taken. The man who had stopped him had
left him with his credit cards and his life.

I pictured the same thing happening to
me. Train stopping, door sliding open, try-
ing to inconspicuously make the transfer
to the northbound car, only to be spotted
instantly, like a walking fluorescent light
bulb, stopped by a very large, very black
man with a cap and a cigarette dangling
out of his mouth, half engulfed by shadow,
asking me th f teful uestlon‘ “Aren't

it you are interested in changing this camp-156m

yet, “I think you missed your stop,

I pondered what I would say in Such a
situation, “Don’t hurt me. Please. I go to
Grinnell, a small liberal arts college in
central Iowa. We have a black library. 1
read Native Son, I‘m on your Side.” [knew
it wouldn't make any difference. I wasn't
scared ol losing my money. I was scared of
the violence and anger which I might enr
counter, for no reason, intensified that
much more by the fact that I was white. It
didn't matter that most of my ancestors
had set foot in this counry in the early
twentieth century, long after the last slave
had been released. By virtue of my skin
color I bore the guilt of the entire white
race, which had built a nation upon slavery
and racism and had systematically ops
pressed minorities throughout the history
of the United States. To the imaginary
assailant whom I had conjured in my
mind, it wouldn’t matter how nice a guy I
was, it Wouldn't matter that I enjoyed
Afro-American literature and pretended to
undersLand the “black problem.” To a
poor black man who needed money, I
would be nothing but white bread, waiting
to be Sliced. I feared that I would realize,
when looking into his eyes, exactly What it
telt like to not be given a chance, to have
lost the race without even reaching the
starting line, simply on the basis or my
Caucasian face.

I felt the train hiss to halt. after what felt
like an eternity. l exited quickly, trying not
to look too lily-white and vulnerable. There
was no one on the transfer bridge. I settled
into my Seat on the northbound El and
breathed a sigh of relief as I saw the
friendly figures of the Sears Tower and
John Hancock building approaching once
more, radiant beacons of safety, shining in
the afternoon sun. Thankful that it was
daylight and the train was empty except
for myself and a few elderly black women,
1 closed my eyes as l lelt myself carried
back downtown, on the first leg of my

rld.
