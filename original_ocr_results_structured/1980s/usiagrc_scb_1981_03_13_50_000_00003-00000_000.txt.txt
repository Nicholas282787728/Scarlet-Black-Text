Faculty to vote on “F” grade after break

by Steve Burnett

In the final scene of The Paper Chase
(the movie), Hart folds the unopened
envelope containing his grades into a
paper airplane and throws it to sea. He
does not care what his grades are
because he feels that what he has learns
ed is more important,

But that is the movies and in real life
at Grinnell Students (and the faculty
and administration) are considerably
concerned about grades. This is ex-
amplified by the controversy over the
"F" grade.

The faculty in W72 voted to eliminate
the “D" and “F" grades. If a student
received either.of those grades, record
of .it was erased from his transcripts.
The “D” grade was reinstated in 1977.
in 1979 the faculty passed a proposal to
reinstate the “D"grade but did not pass
a subsequent proposal which would ac»
tually implement the “1“” grade pro-
posal.

Hence, Grinnell still has no “F."
However. the Committee on Academic
Standing (GAS) was given the task of
preparing another proposal to be
presented to the faculty, who will
decide the fate of the “F" grade
sometime alter break. Dean Catherine
Frazer, who heads the CAS, said that to
obtain student input she assigned to the:
Curriculum Committee (CC) the job of
studying the situation since there are
students on that committee. Based on
their findings, the CC voted to recom-
mend a reinstatement of the "F”

grade.

Another aspect of the proposal is to'

change the deadline for dropping a
class. A student can now drop up to one
week before Hie end of a semester. As
part of the proposal, that will be chang-
ed to an earlier date, probably around
midsemester break. The CC, however,
voted against recommending that it be
changed to either three, six or nine
weeks after a semester begins. Thus,
when the CA5 writes up the actual pro-
posal it will not have a recommendation
upon which to base their drop deadline
decision.

One of the ways in which the CC
studied the situation was to obtain Stu»
dent input at an SGA sponsored torum
held Thursday, March 5.

Arguments presented at the forum
concerning the “F" grade were mutual-
ly exclusive of those concerning the
drop deadline. In fact, most people
were opposed to moving up the drop
deadline.

In many courses, it was argued,
students really do not know what kind
of grade they will be getting by break.
The few who favored moving up the
deadline responded by Saying that by
the time midsemester tests are taken a
student should know whether he is fail»
ing or has an excessively heavy
workload. Also as part of the proposal,
Frazer would attempt to convince
teachers to let students know what kind
of grade they are getting by that time.

with an early deadline, the argument
continued, students would drop for only
“legitimate” reasons. One student
countered, “I think that whatever
reason a student uses to drop is a
legitimate reason."

Discussion on the "F” grade centered
around graduate schools and the grade
point average (GPA). Graduate
schools, the argument went, take into
consideration — to the detriment of the
students — the fact that Grinnell has no
“F." The response was that the G.P.A.
is not the only thing considered and that
Grinnell's reputation is good enough to
overcome that “deficiency.”

Many students felt that everyone's
G.P.A. is made meaningless when peo-
ple (albeit “other people”) can
“manufacture" a good G.P.A. The op-
position retorted by saying that so-
meone cannot get too far by intentional-
ly failing courses because the lack of
credits will catch up with him. The
group added that there is no way to tell
if someone is “manufacturing" his
GPA.

The average Grinnell GPA. for the
ﬁrst semester of the M748 school year
was 2.”. At thlt time the “F" grade
was in effect but it affected only one
percent of the student population. The
avenge G.P.A. for the rust semesters
of the 1M and lml years was 3.01
and 2.97 respectively, with no “F"
grade.

Bob TownerrLarsen, currently the
resident adviser of Younker Hall, will
take over Susan Wittpenn's position as
housing director and assistant dean of
Student Affairs next year, The decision
to hire TownerrLarsen, one of three
candidates, was based on resident ad~
viser evaluations, student interviews
and Student Affairs evaluations.

TownerrLarsen said the job "means
more responsibility but I feel confident
about carrying out those respon-
sibilities." He felt he has the counseling
and administrative skills necessary
and that "this job seems to com bine the
two rather nicely."

changes next year and Towner-Larsen

ing as well as housing problems. The
future housing director said he will

instead of pure administration."

working together [or the next three
