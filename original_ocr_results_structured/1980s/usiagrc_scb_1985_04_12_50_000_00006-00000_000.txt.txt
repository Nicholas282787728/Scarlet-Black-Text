Present Debate?

Check answers you
agreewith.

With Regard to the Peace
Movement?
1) Many observers have identified a

focus on the dangers of nuclear war
and the organization of mass public
protest against national security
policies of the present American
Administration as a dominant
theme moving in the peace move-
merit,

a) Do you agree?

b) How do you assess the im-
pact of the present peace move-
ment if you take as your stan-
dard whether such efforts were
or were not of aid in progress
toward the non-violent resolu-
tions of international conflict?

Excellent. Forced our
Administration to put arms
control polices higher on their
agenda, Built resistance to ex»
panding US. military pro-
grams.

Questionable. Heighten»
ed public awareness of the pro-
blem of nuclear war, but did so
in way which led to
misunderstanding of what
blocks the way to peace.
__Deplorahle. Made the
American peace effort an ally
of Soviet propaganda; confirm-
ed instead oi sought to change
the Soviet agenda.

2) What has the present peace
movement taught about respon-
siblility for the present threat of
war?

_Primarily to be assigned
to US. policies
__Primarily to be assigned
to Soviet policies.
Jqually to be assigned to
U.S, and Soviet policies.
__Lies in the nature of the
present international system
and its present inability to
resolve conflict without war.
Other:

With Regard to Present Ad-
ministration Policy

1) Re: its efforts at strengthening
American military capabilities.

Badly needed to redress
Soviet advantages

Not needed. We have all
the military power we need.
__Sensible for military
security policy, but what we
most need is a peace strategy.
770ther:

2) Re: its efforts at arms control
and disarmament.

Serious and creative ef-.

forts to reach agreements that
will guard against the threat of
war.

Undertaken for pro-
pagandistic purposes, not
calculated to secure Soviet
agreement on what is needed to
guard against the threat of war.
,__Appropriately cautious
given the history of past efforts,
but 'lacking the energy and
creativity needed to secure
Soviet agreement and chart a
way out of the present dilem»
