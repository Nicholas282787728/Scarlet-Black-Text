"New Bluebloods," Dion brings a
fresh approach to the electric

trade as a session guitar player
for the legendary Chess Record
label. He moved on to become a
touring musician for blues artists
such as Albert King. and Millie

when; e worked on Lonnie
Brooks“ 1983 album Hot Shot.

Formed in 1985. the 43rd SL
Blues Band is a visual
representation of the changing
face of the blues. The racial and
sexual mix of the band is very
rare in the black male dominated
world of the blue}. 21 The band

(guitar), Rockin’ Torn l-leimdal
(keyboards), Murphy Doss
(bass), and Earl Howell (drums).

Emo Phillips
comes Sep.2

Emo Phillips. the man
People magazine describes as
the E.T. of stand»up comedy,
will bring his brand of neuro-
comedy to Darby Gymnasium
next Friday (Sep. 2) at9 p.m.

Phillips is known best for his
frequent appearances on Late
Night With David Letterman and
his two cable television specials.
He has also released two live
comedy albums.

His off-beat style has made
him one of the biggest draws on
the comedy club circuit over the

presence ("as warped as one of
the hillbillies in Deliverance") is
as entertaining as his jokes.

will be required for
admission. Tickets will
be required for all faculty
and staff. Ticket dis»
