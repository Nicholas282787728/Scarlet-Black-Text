“Ehhhh, no comprendo,, ‘uva?’ ”
Bates, with the ink still fresh on his
University of Kansas doctoral
thesis, attends the table each week
and, in his second semester of pro
fessorship at Grinnell, has already
begun organizing a Portuguese
table as well Adding to that his 59,
cond major in French and his
teachers certification. one may
sarely abandon any doubt about
Bates' dedication to the learning
process.

“l can‘t think of too many things
more important to learn than a
foreign language. it opens up a
new world to you, a new language.
literature, and culture," says
Bates. He reters back to an early
childhood fascination with foreign
languages in movies and on televi-
sion to explain his present career,
Growing up in a small town near
Dayton, Ohio, Bates followed the
“traditional route" in high school.
studying Spanish and French
because “those were the only
languages uttered,"

“As a student, l was the kid ask-
ing. ‘What's that plant, mommy?’
We have to make sure our educa-
tional system doesn't crush that
child-like excitement and creativi»
ty," Bates likes working with Grins
nell students, but is concerned with
a reticence on their part regarding
opportunities to take charge of
their own education. “There are
few second- or third-semester
students at Spanish Table. We’re
having trouble organizing a
Spanish House. And, rather than
actively participating in class, it
seems safer [or students to sit back
and just see what's going on. They
try to ‘do what the professor
wants,’ " he says. “When, every
once in a while, a student disagrees
with my viewpoint and can support
his or her argument, that’s what
excites me. lshould getas much of
an education from my students as
my students do from me.”

Bates has worked in Mexico and
has traveled through Spain and
much of Europe. "The first time i
left the U.S, was the first time T
understood What America was
about. I not only saw it from a difr
ierent perspective mysell, but also
came into contact with many pear
pie with ditterent perspectives
than mine. America has culture,
certainly,” he insists against those
who argue the oppostie, “Yet we do
get trapped into thinking that ours
is the only way to live, lhope that
students learn to think inr
dependently and to challenge, to
examine what they believe and
either change or aiiirm that
beliefl"

Do you do it because it‘s assigned

il'lnd out he owns 14 semirtrucks
Three of them are in the Caravan
He's been trucking tor 20 years 7
half of his life. He loves to drive. he
explains. The best life in the world
is to be on the road

I wonder if he ever gets tired.
Sometimes in the afternoon, he
says Then he pulls the caravan
over and gets coiiee, since none of
the others ieel like a nap. But at
night he likes to drive until two or
three. Sleep a couple hours, and
back on the road.

I shudder at the thought of two
hours of sleep tonight,

I talk about our travels Mexico
is a nice country, he admits, but
the police are scary. He recounts
the story of two Salvadoran
truckers who were stopped by
police in November and disap-
peared. never to be heard at again.
Best to pay them it they stop you,
to avoid problems.

In fact, Raul tells me, he was
stopped in Mexico City just a few
days ago, They were looking for
drugs. He laughs. why would 1 buy
drugs in the United States and tar
ing them into Mexico, he asks.
They’re cheaper here.

But in Guatemala We won't ever
have trouble like that With the
police, he assures me. They know
their jobs, and they're citizens just
like the rest of the people,

We reach the town of Arriaga,
about three hours from the border.
The caravan stops at a ritzy hotel.
We wonder where we’ll sleep,

Raul offers to let us sleep in the
cars on the back of his semi. It's
almost one by the time we get to

bed. Wakesup, he tells us, is at Cl

as pills, contraceptive roams,
Jellies. condoms, arching spring
rliaphragms. and sponges are ol-
fered, No iUDs (interuterine
devices) or eel-Vical caps are or
fered at this time.

The clinic also offers counseling
for pregnant women. “At the pre
sent time. the clinic counsels all
options tor an unwanted pregnanr
Cy," commented Bruene, “Relers
rzil sheets are given on all options
in a nonrjudgmental way." Bruene
added that "the clinic makes no
appointments for the client for
such services tabortionl."

starting this month, the clinic
will be prohibited from giving any
relerral scrvlces because of rules
eniorced by the Reagan ad
ministration for all family-
planning clinics, according to
Breune Prior to this ruling,
family»planning clinics could give
their patients a list of reterrals as
to where the patient could go if
pregnant. The list consisted of
adoption agencies, abortion
clinics, and non-profit groups such
as Birthright. The clinics would not
suggest one method over another
and would not make appointments
for a patient, but would inform her
of all services available in the
area. When these new guidelines
go into etiect, the familyrplanning
clinic will not be allowed to give
referral listings to the expectant
mother under any circumstances.
At the present time, three court ac~
tion suits are challenging the ad-
ministration on these rules. The
American Medical Association is
bringing one of the three suits to
court.

Still, the clinic maintains funds
from private, state, and federal
agencies to provide health care at
affordable prices. The clinic offers
yearly exams for :30 and birth-
control pills for so per month. But
these prices are at the highest
price on a sliding-scale tee syst

@Eﬂlﬁlﬂlﬁﬂftﬂl

The scale price ranges according
to the level or income of the patient
or the patient's family, if she
wishes to declare their income.
Some patients may be in a situa-
tion where nothing is paid. But
even at the highest prices on the
scale tor birth-control pills, the
clinic otters rates that are halt the
rates in the local drugstores Birth-
control pills at most oi the pharr
macies in town are priced at $15
per month

~~ror the care and price. it‘s dit-
ticult to argue with it [the clinici,"
said Sally. “I want to go to so
meone who's going to deal with
lgynecological care] every day,"
Sally’s concern centered around
going to the clinic instead nl going
to a general practitioner in town
who would simply send the client to
another doctor ii there were a
serious problem.

Sally tound the nurse practir
tioners at the clinic “really respon-
sive. triendiy, and anxious to do a
good job. And, ideally, if I could
pay $14 [on a sliding scale] instead
of no [for a yearly examinationl, i
would."
