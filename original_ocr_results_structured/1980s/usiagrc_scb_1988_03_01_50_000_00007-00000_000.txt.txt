What is your opinion of
the 3-2 program?

Pleshette Hamh

,l personally don'tlikeitbecausc,
although the administration says
that it won't cut out special-topic
courses or it won't minimize the
diversity, that w have in the cure
riculum, I thin will. I think that
the 3-2 program is going to in-
crease the class size, and one of the
main reasons why I came here is
because the classes are supposed
to be so personal and l was suppos-
ed to be able to have a good conmct
with my professor. i think that's
going to change, My most suc-
cesstul classes I've had here have
been the ones with 15 to 20 students
and everyone has a chance to
speak, Another problem i have
with it is that while they're taking
in the professors‘ perspective on it,
a lot of it is being pushed off on the
students and we're being affected
most by the 3-2 program. It would
have been nice to have a voice in
that when we're going to be all
fected by it.

Why should studenm want
you to represent them to the
world outside of Grinnell?

Pleshelte Ilalllh
I'm well»aware of student issues
and student concerns from being a
part of campus organizations, in
those organizations We had to be a
person who was calm, outspoken
enough to get the point across but
wihtout becoming overbearing or
hotheaded. I think the students
would want me to represent them
because oi my leadership skills.
my capabilities to relate to a more
, diverse group of people which they
can see through the campus
organizations that l've been irr
volved in, And i have good speak-
ing skills; I'm able to talk and ad
dress things when I'm asked about
them,

How do you view your
role 'as Judicial Council
“Prosecutor”?

Rob Killion

As Ali ElSalfar would say, the
Judicial Council Prosecutor is
a little like the campus Dis-
trict Attorney. In my role as
that Prosecutor, very simply i
would try to follow tlle exams
ple that All has set. I think
Ali‘llas almost turned the prose.
cuting position into an artiorm
in some respects. I’ve worked
with him on a daily basis when
he has investigated cases, when
he has made charges, when he
has worked with Student Affairs
concerning these charges, 1 Sims
ply, I think, would follow the
method he uses, that being, be
total would bring anyone before
Judco or even confront someone
i would be very very sure of my
facts, very very sure of my in
formation. And ifI was, then
I would prosecute aggressively.
I wouldn’t have a problem be-
ing in a position of someone
prosecuting another student. It
wouldn’t be tlle most comfortr
able position to be in, but I‘m
prepared to take tllat respollsi»
bility because someone has to do
it and I tllillk I’m the best pere
son [or the job.

Presidential Interviews

Why should students want
you to present them to the
outside world?

Brad Sheridan

Because i know I'm very
capable oi expressing myselt. To
the general public, I know where to
put emphasis on certain issues and
i know they‘ll know that I'll say
what everybody Ieels and rm not
going to be intimidated like some
are in classes and some are in the
administration. I‘ll tell them how it
is and I'll take the raptor it. i know
that people know that I'll do my
best. As long as i know I'm trying,
even ii things don't work out, more
good will happen than bad.

How do you think you can
improve the town—gown
(town-college) relation»
ship?

nave steihman

it's a very important thing which
needs to be improved. especially
with the bar scene. I'd like to see
more educational type things on
homosexuality. things like that
that maybe the town isn't aware of.
You always have all these loruins
and things that are touchy issues
around here. and I would like to see
some oi those things be open to the
town. to get the town more involve
ed in things like that. Just more
awareness with the town I walk
around and you hear the town peo-
ple just yelling out. assuming that
the majority oi the people that go
here are homosexual. That's
wrong. in a way also, They have to
be shown that not everyone here is
a total freaked out liberal. and that
those people aren't bad. There's a
tension there that I don't think
needs to exist It just takes US gets
ting more involved, educating the
town.

If you had to make two
campaign promises, what
would they be?

have Steinman

Better concerts and films. and
more representation and student
input into SGA.

In what specific ways
would you work to inform
students better about how
SGA functions?

Dianna Ward

That would make a good 5 and B
article because there are a lot at
students Who do actually read
through the s and B. contrary to a
lot of people's bellf....’l‘he more
that it's Seen, the more that the
students are in touch with the way
things go....The campus organiza-
tion that would include all these
people from diiierent organiza
tions would touch a big part of the
campus. I think there are
altogether about 40 people on the
men's soccer team, both JV and
varsity. There were 25 people on
the Women's soccer team. There
are 30 members on the list (or
GCGC. There are altogether 10 or
ls people for the homeless. That's
a lot oi people, a lot more people
you're getting in there that know
about SGA. And then you could
stress to your senator, i would tell
them to let their dorm know just
how SGA runs instead of just put-
ting up notes.

It you had to summarize
your campaign in one
sentence, what would it be?

llrad Slleritlau
"I've been there in the past and
l'll always be there in the future."

What is your opinion of
people with no SGA ex-
perience running for presi-
dent?

Greg Evans

i think that people running with
no SGA experience could potential-
1y help son, but in the very beginn»
ing they're going to hurt SGA. SGA
has gone through three presidents
in the past that have had to learn
the job all over again. Without that
continuity, other cabinet members
are going to have to teach the
president what the role should be,
how to accept implicit responsibilr
ty, and that's going to harm SGA
Whereas we could take oii from
where we are this year, we're go-
ing to have to go back in time and
rebuild that beiore we can improve
and advance our goals.

Who would you like to see
as SGA vice president?

Greg Evans

I don't know it I want to answer
that. Rob Killian, from what I've
seen. has put in the most commit
ment and has the most realistic
Stance on the office. Cathy Baldwin
also has considerable experience
and Tom Worth has sat on various
committees that the vice president
would also sit on.

Vice-Presidential Interviews

that people on campus are be-
ing treated as humanely as pos
sible. if there is any person or
persons who are not respecting
the student, the campus, faculty
or administration, then it is my
role to prosecute them as i see
ﬁt. Anyone who is breaking the
rules in such a way that it is
hurting themselves or someone
else, clther physically, emotion
ally or just by the intent, then i
will prosecute to the full extent.

Cathy Baldwin

Judco is a board of inquiry.
Unfortunately a lot of people
seem to equate it with a’coilrt
oflaw. My job as viceapresidcllt
by the dictates of the by—laws
is to represent the student body
or any other party as a person
to request a hearing and press
charges for any violation of a
student’s rights, or college regr
ulations, or residence hall rules,
and so forth. I think the rea-
sons that Judco is perceived as
ineffective is that. one, people
cquate it with a court of law
and, two that it is very difﬁ-
cult to take advantage of what
Judco can do ill terms of reminds
ing people cithcir responsibility.
1 think that’s the primary goal
of the viccaprcsident in terms of
their function as a prosecutor.
I'm aware of what my forum]
duties are in Judco and since

we don’t have a formal investi—
gator, my role is to go around
and ﬁnd witnesses, and deter
mine the damages and who did
it or why or when or how. My
role is as someone who can rep-
resent the student body in such
cases where there has been a vi-
olation and I may represent that
person or the community as a
whole in bringing these charges
before judicial council. 1 think
that is very very important be-
cause apathy does exist, and a
lot of people don’t know how to
press charges or how to ask for
a hearing at Judco. So, ior ex
ample, we have $500 worth of
damage and who’s going to pay
for it? The students. , . through
student government. One way
or another it hurts you. It’s re-
ally important that people re»
alize that they have to be held
accountable and Judco is one
of our only means of doing so.
Sometimes it’s only a slap on
the wrist, but we do have means
available to us. We can impose
fines, we can suggest a, conduct
probation or a conduct warm
ing or even dismissal. Obviously
the ﬁlial decision does not rest
with Judco, but our recommen-
dations are based upon hearings,
The better I am able to repre
sent that person and gather i ,
formation regarding the viola-
tion, the better I am able to rep»

resent the student body

Stephanie nedrnnn

At times rm sure it’s a very
sticky position to be in. Judco’s
very important to have on this
campus, It’s just a matter or
being impartial and getting an
ciiective hearing run. 1 think I
could do that well.

Chris Gunst

That’s probably the touchiest
role that the vice-president has.
You have to uphold the school
honor. code. Forget the lye
ing, cheating, stealing, because
that‘s the easy stuff. Some
thing like slander, you have to
do something about that be-
cause tlint just cannot happen
at Grinnell College. As SGA
Vice-President i can’t tolerate
that. I have to prosecute to
the fullest extent. Vt'e’re a very
liberal place, but if something
comes up against judicial code,
then you’ve got to prosecute.

Tom Worth

That role is very important.
You’re protecting student rights,
which in a way, is the most. ima
portant job, or important as—
pact, of the viceapresidellt’s job,
more than anything else, There
i just remembering cases m
some people who got brought
before there can be very intim-
idating, and a lot of times stu»

Paul Froese

As little as possible. Let's lace it,
i want the money and i want the
room, Admittedly, SGA is impor-
tant and i don‘t want to put son
down, but my time is important to
me and i don't want to spend a lot
0[ time bickering over stuff. i want
to do concise good deeds io this
campus and any work more than
that i won't do.

Greg Evans

At the minimum, like I said, I
think i put in around two or three
hours average now, and i think
that will step up as president, so
times seven, what does that come
out to be? Twenty or SD hours, I
think it's going to take that much,
at least. to run a successful SGA
and student body. like the way I
want to do it.

Dianna Ward

I figure with the time I've
already spent doing things that
I've done, I estimate that it would
probably take three or four hours
out of each or my days. That’s why
I'm going to schedule around that.
I want to take a lot of time as SGA
president, because i see a lot that
needs to be done, It would be one of
my top priorities, seeing what l
could do, because I have to
graduate from this school and id
like to see its ratings stay up, I'd
also like to see students want to
stay here and students like this
place. Sol want to spend a lot at
time with SGA. A lot of time. Likel
said, three or four hours a day, And
that's not unreasonable. I already
spend two hours a day going over
stuff that I want to see done.

Brad Sheridan

rd always be president, every
minute oi day. Each week i know
I'd have oiiice hours. rd say about
a median of l2, oil the top oi my
head, including meetings and
everything.

Dave Sleinman

Between twelve and iiiteen. i
spend about ten or twelve hours a
week as treasurer, and that will go
up I think that‘s a realistic
estimate.

dents are afraid to bring some
one to Judicial Council because
of the intimidation. And, you
have to be able to stand up for
the students, when someone’s
abusing the college regulations,
abusing the system. This is a
self—governing system and when
people abuse it, someone has to
stand up for it, and a lot of
times students aren’t willing to.
Someone has to, and that’s a
vice-presidellt‘sjob. And, that‘s
essential for this student self-
goverilment to work. Someone
has to be willing to take some
one to Judicial Council, or notll»
ing‘s going to happen. It’s not
going to work. And so, 1 View
the job as prosecutor as a very
important one, and also one that
has to be done right, If you
don’t do it right, it won’t be an
entirely fair trial. You have to
do the job right, You have to
know what it takes , you have
to know what kind of evidence
it takes to make it worthwhile
to take the person to Judicial
Council. It‘s a strain on eve
one: it’s a strain on the meme
bers of Judicial Council, it’s a
strain on the defendant, it’s a
strain on you. You gotta make
sure you do it right. You have
to stand up for students. lcan’t
say much more.
