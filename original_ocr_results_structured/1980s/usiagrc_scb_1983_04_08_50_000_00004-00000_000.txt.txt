How about

some sense,
“before it’s too late ”

The Chicago mayoral election used to be an easy one to call. You’d
hold the Democratic primary, and then you’d essentially have your
next mayor, or at least know who it was. Turn it on, and the machine
worked. Unless of course you’re Harold Washington.

For the first time in some fifty~oddsyears the Democratic machine
(as it is so ironically called) is not wholeheartedly supporting the
Democratic candidate for mayor. Some would argue that this lack of
support is because of Washington’s tendency not to settle his debts.
Others would insist that it‘s because of his rather undistinguished
political career. The more realistic observers might point instead to the
more painfully obvious cause ~ Harold Washington is black.

The current Chicago election is a striking example of how little cer-
tain parts of this country have really progressed in terms of race rela~
tions since the Civil Rights Act. Though possibly a little more
sophisticated or a little better hidden, racism in politics still exists.

As is becoming more readily apparent each day, Bernard Eptorl, the
Republican candidate, is capitalizing on this underlying sentiment to
win every vote he can on the basis of- race. He denies it of course, but
with the campaign slogan such as “Epton ~ before it’s too late,” his
denials seem to lack a bit of substance.

Epton isn’t the only one preoccupied with race however, the whole ci-
ty is. Skintone has become the talk of the town. When the Chicago
Tribune endorsed Washington for mayor, the violent reaction was
startling. Subscriptions were cancelled, accusations ﬂew and ugly
words shot forth — ugly words that served as a grim reminder that
some people’s objections to Washington stem from more than just his
failure to pay the electric bill.

It is easy for some to dismiss racism as a factor and to point to
Washington’s slightly hazy record as the cause of lack of support in
some parts. But a cursory glance at the Chicago mayors of the past half
century (Democrats all) reveals activities and pursuits for more ques»
tionable (and imaginative) than Washington‘s. But when you are
Richard J . Daley or Jane Byrne, most slight indiscretions are easily ex—
cused by the color of your skin.

Such an occurrence is as appalling, disgusting, and disheartening as
it is predictable. One would think that in 1983 such petty politics and are
chaic sentiments wouldhave disappeared. But not in the toddlin’ town
of Chicago (and undoubtedly many other towns which lack such na»
tional attention), a city where most neighborhoods are either 95 percent
white or 95 percent black. To depolarize such a city requires a person
who transcends mediocrity — a person greater than either Harold
Washington or Bernard Epton.

The mediocrity of the candidates is as discouraging as the actions
and emotions surrounding the campaign. 15 it not possible that the
quality of these candidates has permitted the whole ugly mess to occur.
One cannot hope to see a change in attitudes or quality in this election,
or even the one after that. We can hope that the citizens of Chicago and
beyond will change their time “before it’s too late” v but don’t hold
your breath.

Grinnell’s liberalness questioned

To the Editor"

In the time i have spent at Grinnell. l
have iound the “Grinnell Experience” to
be anything but a liberal education, the
"GE" has been an education in how to be a
political liberal The campus environment
is selfvrighteously liberal and appears to
be impervious to any ideas not in accoiu
dance with the "liberal ideology" on catn-
pus

A liberal arts education is supposed to be
comprised oi a variety oi disciplines views
ed irom a number or diiiei-ent perspec-
tives. At Grinnell the diiierent perspec-
tives range iroin moderately liberal to
radical, Classes, newspaper nrticlcs.
collegesponsored lectures and student-
sponsored lectures are overwhelmingly to
the tell. The campus is bombarded with
the liberal viewpoint and there is little at
tempt to present any other points at view,

I realize that polllical syinposiums and
lectures will tend to be leit wing in content
because oi the liberal nature or the
students and inculty. However, a liberal,
by dciinition, should allow and encourage
diiierent ideologies to be presented.

it would benciit the entire campus. What
