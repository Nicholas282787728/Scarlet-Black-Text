Central American Support Group
set coming events

by Flora Winitz

To remind the Grinnell community
that the issue of U,S,-Central American
relations is far from dead, the Central
American support group is sponsoring
a series ol events beginning Sunday,
April 21. The lowa Campaign to stop
War in Central America.with which the
group is affiliated, was proclaimed by
the midwest coordinator of the Pledge
of Resistance to be the “best organized
and most active 01 Pledge of Resistance
groups.”

The Central American Support Group
is mainly known on campus for its
reierendum, which was overwhelming

1y passed last semester by a 4 to 1
margin.

“The issue was only raised by Matt
Golden the central American support
group did all the work for the referenr
dums,” stated Rob Curley. a group
member, “I consider it a victory for the
group."

But the group has been active long
before the relerendum issue. In
November, when the state coordinator
ol the “lowa Campaign to stop War in
Central America” was in the area, the
group worked with the Grinnell Peace
Fellowship to raise money for the

Witness for Peace movement. The
group raised approximately $400.00.

The group also wrote Grinnell’s
pledge oi resistance, and has sent
clothing to refugees in Costa Rica
Endless letter writing campaigns call-
ing [or a halt in American aid to the
Contras, have also demanded much of
their time.

“We’ve written Sen. Grassley nearly
100 letters and he still supports Contra

'aid, though in his recent talk here he

waffled and couldn‘t answer our ques-
tions," Curley said.

Closing the back door to immigration

by i lora Winitz

As part of the Rosenfleld Program
Symposium on Immigration, Con-
gressman Romano Mazzoli (D. -l,l<y co-
author of the Simpson Mazzoll [Bill
delended the bill. wh|ch would curtail
the llow oi illegal aliens into the United
states. Thursday night in Herrick
Chapel.

The bill. which critics say
discriminates against Hispanics,
originated in 1972 in an attempt to up
date immigration laws and make them
more workable in‘ modern society.
Since, then. the bill has gone through
more than 300 revisions and IS still be-
ing debated.

Rebuking those who claim im-
migrants come into the country,
become citizens and then seek wellare
payments which would be taken away
from current U. S. citizens Mazzoli
stated that “immigrants come into the
country looking for work. they are some
of the best workers we have. often doing
the grungy work we ills, citizens]
don't want to do. tor a cheap price. So
legalized aliens would not be a burden
on the weliare program.”

The bill‘would make it a Civil. and
possibly criminal, penalty for
employers to knowingly hire illegal
aliens. By eliminating what the aliens
come to the country ior. Mazzoli hopes
the bill will not only slow down im-
migration but will also provide addi.
tional jobs tor U. s. citizens.

A second element of the bill ads
dresses the illegal aliens who are
already in the country. Though no one
knows how many are currently in the
U.S.. Mazzoli estimated ﬁle number to
be between three and eight million
while other congressmen estimate the

number to be as high as ten million,
Those illegal aliens who were in the
country before 1977. and are not guilty
or drug. criminal. or any or as other ex-
clusions, would be given the option oi
becoming a citizen alter a riveyear
waiting period.

Illegal aliens who came into the coun-
try between 1977 and 1980 would be
given temporary residency status and,
alter a five~year period would be allow-
ed permanent residency status with the
option or becoming a citizen. For those
aliens who entered the country illegally
alter 1982, the bill makes allowances for
permanent residence. but not ior
citizenship.

The Simpson-Mazzoli Bill also calls
lor additional security at the borders at
Canada and Mexico, and even in
Florida. and the bill would highten ine
terior eniorcement activity. Recent in-
creases in legal immigration quotas
call for stricter curbs on illegal im-
migration activity, according to Maz-
zoli. .

“Unless we close the backdoor. we
wont be able to keep the from door
open. To remain a strong nation, we
need immigrants to‘vitalize us,” Maz-
zoli said.

Another issue .Mazzoli's bill ads
dresses is the problem oi asylum. A
proposed plan will recognize “iriendly”
and “unfriendly" nations. Chances for
asylum would be based on the status of
the nation that the person is escaping
from. The U 5. would be more likely to
grant asylum irom “uniriendly” oa-
tions than from “friendly" nations.
Specially trained Judges would deter»
mine each asylum case.

Currently, the United States requires

both visas and passports {or visitors to
the country, while western European
nations require only passports tor
American travellers As part oi Maz-
zolls plan a three- -year experiment
would waive the visa requirement tor
eight unnamed countries These coun-
tries would have a low deniability and
exclusion rate

Finally, Mazzoll hopes to institute a
liveryear phase out oi the program
which allows foreign students in the
United States to become immigrants
while studying herec Mazzoli's bill
would force loreign students to return
to their country [or at least two years
before coming back to the U.S. as irnr
migrants.
