Could she be the first woman
president in four years?

Lu Anne Shearer, a Junior sociology major; is the only
woman running in the six-way race for SGA president. She
believes the SGA has failed to inform the campus coni-
munity ol' the issues it deals with and this accounts for its
bad reputation among students

“There are a hell of a lot of students out there who are
not apathetic," Shearer insists

She sees herself as being a different kind of candidate,
one who may represent those who are at least potentially
Interested in student government, but who are turned oil
by the cliquishness and egotism surrounding the current
son hierarchy

“I'm not a druggie, not a feminist, and not a jock.,.,'j
she points out.

Although she lacks some of the practical experience
some of the other candidates have, Shearer says she could
quickly absorb what she would need to know over the last
three months at the semester. She says she is motivated
and has the time to learn the ropes much as Current SGA
preSident David Kramer did last year, Kramer, who cam-
paigned as the davidic messiah, served an apprenticeship
under Greg Youtz and Shearer believes he has done a good
Job; she could also do the job alter a similar appren-
ticeship.

As SGA president, Shearer says she Will work closely
with her cabinet and with Joint Boards. She does not see
health center service as a major issue, but she would like
to explore the possibility of having a gynecological doctor
visit the campus occasionally, or of operating a shuttle
service to the women's clinic ill Marshalltowii. She 5
having a mononucleosis test at the Health Center is
desirable but Should be paid for individually by students
rather than provided for as a service.

Shearer beiieves the lounge furniture problem can he
alleviatedinpart by renting furniture to students “SGA is
not a radical governmental body," Shearer states, “It's
hogwash to expect radical change."

Shearer emphasizes the seriousness of her campaign,
At first, she says, some friends encouraged her to run a
joke campaign, but she rejected the idea "it's not a
Joke," she said.
