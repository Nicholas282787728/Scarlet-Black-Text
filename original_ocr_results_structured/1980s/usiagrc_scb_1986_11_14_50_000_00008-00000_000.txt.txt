Breaker
Morant

by Jill Ellis
BREAKER MORANT (1980) is another
example of the excellent films to have
come recently irom Australia. Directed by
Bruce Berestord, the film is a courtroom
drama based on a real- lite travesty of
British justice
' The film takes place in turn-ot-the-
century Australia, at the close of the Boer
War, Three Aussie soldiers are brought to
court martial, charged with murdering
Boer civilians in a raid during which a
German missionary was also killed
(resulting in international embarrassment
for the British lorces in charge) The Comr
mander decides to make an example of the
three men in order to appease the foreign
hostility towards what looks like (and in
fact is) a highly unethical war, much like
the Viet Nam War (indeed. this ﬁlmin-
vites comparison betweenlthe two wars),
It is obvious that the men committed the
“crime” with which they are accused but
it is equally obvious that in doing so they
were merely following orders handed
down by the British commanding forces
The film’s script is excellent, the
characters are drawn superbly, and the
acting does justice to both, Edward Wood-
ward plays the title role to perfection:
Morant is a sterling character whose ins
tegrity is nicely complemented by his
almost whimsmal appremation of the irony
of his situation. Bryan Brown, almost
unrecognizable behind a huge moustache,
plays another oi the accused, and Jack
Thomson plays their defense lawyer.
This film is intelligent, sophisticated,
and beautiiul e although sometimes pain
in] — to watch.

Bringing
Up Baby

by Kate Worster

BRINGING UP BABY( 19387 is a classic
screwball comedy starring Katherine
Hepburn and Cary Grant Directed by
Howard Hawks (TO HAVE AND HAVE
NOT. SCARFACE), BRINGING UP
BABY ieatures one of Hephurn’s iinest
comic periormances.

Hepburn plays Susan Vance, an heiress,
who falls in love with an archeologist
played by Cary Grant. Grant who plans to
marry his boring secretary and spend his
lire engrossed in his bones, iinds his liie
turned upside down when Susan enters his
life, He loses a priceless dinosaur bone,
alienates the benefactor of the museum
(who happens to be Susan’s aunt), and
chases a loose leopard through the woods.
Between these crazy antics and a night in
jail, he Ialls in love with Susan.

Hawks, best known as an action film
director pulls the crazy plot together to
make BRINGING UP BABY an extremely
iunny film. The periormances are very
good Although the potential oi the team
was not really developed until THE
PHILADELPHIA STORY, Hepburn and
Grant work well together. The supporting
cast features May Robson as Susan's aunt,
Nissa. a beautiiul leopard (the Baby in the
title); and Asta (from the Thin Man
series) as Susan‘s dog. BRINGING UP
BABY is a classic comedy making It a
good lighthearted way to spend a low

The
Conversation

by Kevin O'Prey

Gene Hackrnan plays the saxophone, He
also listens to the things people say when
they think they are alone. As an electronic
surveillance specialist, Hackman is called
upon to eavesdrop on a man and a woman
talking in a park. His assignment ex-
ecuted, the ‘Bud-man’ becomes obsessed
with what he hears in the recording he has
made. Moral questions oI his own
culpab ity begin to plague him Much like
Antonioni’s BLOWVUP, the protagonist
here is suddenly thrust into a crisis that
springs irom what he believed to be an
honest day’s work.

THE CONVERSATION is Francis Ford
Coppola’s ﬁrst film ioliowing his triumph
with THE GODFATHER. Coppola also
wrote the tight and entertaining script.
Hackman is given a certain bland and
lifeless existence to emphasize his pathos
as hero. There are elements of KaIka in his
total detachment and solitude from the
society around him. This sechonIined
state becomes instrumental in his col-
lapse,

Record Review

Woodentops

by Kristen Stromberg

R010 McGintiy, the main singer»
songwriter ior the Woodentops, got his
band’s name from a British children's TV
show about a family of Clothespins. The
band has enjoyed a selective iollowing in
the UK but has fallen short of major-label
status and remained on the underground
scene.

This will end soon for the Woodentops in
their debut album, “Giant“,
reached the number 2 position on the col-
lege album charts this {all and their next
single is to be released through Columbia
Records “Giant“ is a pop album made
distinctive by its frenzied rythm and drivV
1ng melodies. The drums. played by Benny
Staples, are as dominant as in a Husker Du
album, but the melody comes through with
the keyboards and McGinty’s rich voice.
Perhaps the best thing about the album is
the heavy use 01 acoustic guitar, which
contributes a fast and tinny sound There
are also interesting guitar solos on songs
such as "Last Time“ that save this album
from the anonymity oi just another British
pop eiiort,

The album is deﬁnitely upbeat and easy
to listen to: songs like “Love Affair with
Everyday Livin“ and “So Good Today“
almost burst with enthusiasm. This has
brought the band some critimsm and a
question about the triteness oi their songs,
but the Woodentops never pretended to be
psychologically piercing; they re just out
ior a good time. McGinty said oi the LP in
reporter. “ti
you compare it to the Simply Reds oi this
world it still sounds really punky and
messy, so its all right. .1 li you re looking
ior some beat in your pop enjoyment,
check out the Woodtop's debut album.
