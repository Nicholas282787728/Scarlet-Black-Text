Success takes a beating

by Chris Hamp/

According to Dr. Bruce ogilvie. pros
fessor of psychology at San Jose
University, any person can be caught
up in an obsession of competition that
leads to stress. Ogilvie made his com-
ments last Tuesday during his speech
on “The Emotional Costs 01 Success"
as part of Grinnell's Health and Fitness
Week.

Emotional stress caused by the drive
to compete and succeed has become a
very real problem in America as well
as in other countries, According to
Ogilvie, the basic problem with success
is the general attitude or people
towards success, both with memselves
and others.

Ogilvie stressed that people need to
understand their personal feelings
about success. He also feels that we as
Americans should try to teach our
children that they must develop a per
sonal sense of values towards cumpeth
tion and success.

Ogilvie, author of Problem Athletes
and Hﬂw to Deal with Them, is one of
the foremost experts on stress caused
by success. He has dealt with the stress
of athletes on several us, Olympic
Teams and has lectured on this subject
throughout the world at many major
universities and institutions. He
dominates all of the literature in the
world written on athletic stress and
gave the Keynote Address on this held
at the World Congress in israel.

Ogilvie cited many examples of emo-
tional stress caused by the drive to suc-
ceed. His examples related to both
aﬂiletics and life in general, Among
these examples, Ogllvie discussed the
spectator pressure situation in all
levels of athletics, in which fans often-
times insult and even provoke athletes
because they feel that the athletes per»
formance or actions did not live up to
their expectation.

Ogilvle stated that the Cliche “the
world just loves winners" is completely
false. He feels just the opposite is true,
Being successful or being in command

is burdensome, lonely, and the source
of much ridicule. He stated that these
conditions take place in all aspects of
life, including business, medication,
law enforcement, and the military. The
solution Ogilvie stated is, “That we
must help people to understand the
dangers inherent in responsibility."

Another problem Ogilvie feels has
gotten out ol hand in America is the
raising of children in an unhealthy
“drive to‘succeed" atmosphere, He
feels children are oftentimes pushed to
the point where they are crowded out oi
their own lives.

He feels the greatest portion of this
pushing is coming from parents.
ogilvie stated a type of psychological
barrier known as the "neurotic parents
syndrome” has developed in this coun-
try. This iS a condition in which parenu

or Arts and Sciences; Deccan College in
India; and Gyuto Tantric College in In-

Before coming to Amherst, Thurman
served as a research fellow and the con-
sulting associate director of the In-
stitute for Advanced Studies of World
Religions in New York. He presently

get so involved in children’s lives that
they push the children out of their own
lives.

ogilvie feels that the best parents in
one who “can be a guest in that;
children's life," entering only when in-
vited and staying out when the child
“shuB their door on them."

Ogilvie, a man in love with his worht
claims he does his job because he feds
that the achievement motive is dying in
America. He feels it is important [or all‘
people to develop a self interest and
personal set of goals in order to sue
ceed. * '

Although his speech was given during
Health and Fitness Week, much of his,
speech also applied to students and
their career goals. Said ogilvie, “A jub‘
is like a lover—you must ﬁnd it {at
yourself."
