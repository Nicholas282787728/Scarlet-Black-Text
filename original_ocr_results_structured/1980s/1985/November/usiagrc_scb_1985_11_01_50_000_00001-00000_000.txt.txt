Eleven Grillnellians were among the 120
protesters arrested at the Rock Island
Arsenal on October 21 Police estimated
that SDI) to 600 nonviolent demonstrators
were present at the al'Senal‘s three en-
trances The protest was the second in the
past 16 months.

Like many of thc protcsters. the 14 Grin-
ncll students at the protest were there to
"express [their] outrage over the op-
pressive use or the weapons made at the
Rock Island Arsenal." according to a
Statement released by the 14 students,
"The weapons produced iai the arsenall
add lo people's suiiering both directly and
philosophically, By producing and expor-
ting weapons our government is promoting
opprcssion in ioreign nations. The
weapons made lat thc arsenall not only
alloii repressive governments to remain in
power but symbolize our support or the
repression in these countries. We [were
ihcrel to symbolize our unwillingness to
support our government‘s actions." the
statement Said.

Protesters lallcd in tlieirgoalol shutting
down the arsenal ior the day.
Demonstrators arrived around 4.00 a m

in order to stop workers iroln coming to
work only to rind ienccs and armed guards
waiting for them, in (act. 98 percent of the
workers showed up tor wor . compared to
the usual 96 percent attendance on a Mons
day. '

"They were expecting us. and the best
we could do was make the workers late."
Dale Strickler. a protester. said. ”There
was always a sense or Secrecy. We knew
there were inliltrators — undercover
policemen posing protesters.”

The key to peasant resistance is "work-
ing the system to minimum disadvantage
rather than transiorming it." according to
pi-olessor James Scott.

Scott st -ed the importance oi peasant

Scott. While this may 1 ad some to dis-
count the effectiveness or validity oi the
"unorganized, opportunistic and sells
indulgent resistancc. ii. .is the iusion ol
scli interest and resistance ithat) lills

Scott argued that the apparently lrlvlal
means ol resistance. such as vandalism or
stealing. "lays the bedrock on which oiher
terms at resistance may grow." in Sunjai

Again stressing the unorganized. more

individualized resistance. Scott ended his
talk. He emphasized that iniormal and
unorganized tactics such as "foot draggv

that he was just doing his job. but that 70

Gladstein added. "The police said that
