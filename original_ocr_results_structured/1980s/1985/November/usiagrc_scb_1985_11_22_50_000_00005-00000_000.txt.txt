A beating heart of darkness

Cooling wisps oi burdened lungs curled
a bout blackrfurred hoods. lost their desire,
and iaded into the grey sky. Newly
awakened grumbles. cut short by brusque
d irections, echoed cacophonously from the
silent. cropped forest. A light. iorgiving
breeze listlessly tossed the green canvas;
a hawk rode proudly on the wind. circled
the men. voiced a desperate lamentation,
and landed quickly among the ice-covered
trees. unnoticed.

Stirring. the ice on the trees began to
crackle. shuddering with a pitiful loudness
as heavy branch danced with heavy
branch. and was silenced by the defiant
roar of the awakened machines, Black.
noxious mist replaced the white puffs of
breath Like five mechanical. black snow-
leopards. the driven beasts pranced

’ awkwardly away from their den. Etched in
the Iield were crisscrossed scars from
reckless pursuits. scars that generations
of winters could not heal. The satiated
hunters added their sloppy. conspicuous,
dirty tracks to the injury; spilling their
liieless pollution. consecrating the snow to
a deity they didn't create.

The polished. deep-black machines cons
trasted with the previously undisturbed
snow. and appeared as a smear of moving
darkness against a formless. blurred Wall
of crystal. The forest. surrounding the in-
truders. but unable to stop them. was as
impenetrable as the folded. stern arms of
an angered parent iorced to witness his
rebellious children mature under the in
iiuence oi some malign usurper. ,

As the snowfield's irregularities were
swiftly conquered. the wind tugged
hopeiully at the hunter’s westernstyle
cowboy hats. Suit hands jerked molded
shiny alloy clasps tighter around nylons
scarfed necks. hurried by the bitterness of
the wind. and secured the hats. Their
heads w ‘e lost. engulfed by the material.
They did not bow their heads even slightly.

Professionalism addressed

Regarding Tom Eissenberg's editorial
comment tollowing Cassandra Ewert’s let-
ter to the editor in the November is issue
of the S&B . . . How can you. on the one
hand. say that the ssh; isn‘t a proiessional
paper and thus shouldn’t be compared to
one there i reier to an editorial you wrote
earlier this year). and, on the other hand.
you compare the type oijournalism Ewert
rcters to 7 in connection with your
editorial on the Rock island arsenal pro-
testers 7 to a proiessionai paper ii ..
your comment iollowing her article.
“There is a place ior this type ui Jourr
nalism: page a oi the Chicago Tribune")

rirst oi all. let me say i was tempted to
respond to your earlier editorial regarding
T he SMS‘s status as a protessional publica»
tion I’m addressing it now. however,
because its relevant to the above con~
tradictions l've noted concerning your
editorial comments. My basic problems,
then and now. with your argument are.
ltvour editorial sounded like a convenient
excuse ior allowing the 5&3 staii to print
anything it desires. and. it the material is

less than proiessional, well. that's okay
because. hey. you're just amateurs
anyway. right? Wrong and that brings
me to my second point; at Granted. we can
say that the 5&8 itself isn't a professional
publication in the sense that students don't
pay to read it every Friday. It‘s also sale
to assume that staii members aren'
fesslonals since you don’t make a living
irom working [or the 5&8. But. in your ei-
iorts to disclaim the staii as proiessional.
you obscure the diiierence between the
status oi the staii and publication and the
quality oi the iinal product 7 the latter
having to do with proiessionalisni. the
practice ot which does not require the
status of “professmnal.” It does require,
however. upholding the responsibilities
you'vc assumed by hlling an editors posi-
tion — responsibilities not only to your
readers but also to the rest or the staii and
to the journalistic protession <1 use the
terms looselyi as well

in terms or proiessionalism, your come
m cnt at the end of Ewert's letter was com-
pletely inappropriate. Letters to the editor

provide the campus community with a

public iorum to express its views.
Editorials provide editors with this
privilege. and “never the two shall meet.”
l-low otten do we see readers' comments
iollowing an editorial?

Despite the inappropriateness oi the
comment itseli. its message was
ridiculous. . so what ii the Tribune prints
this type oi Journalism? Do another's shod
dy journalism practices (no matter how
proiessional the paper is supposed to be)
m ake it acceptable tor the 8&8 to engage
in the same sort oi practices?

it you put your time and energy into
sound. accurate reporting (whether news
or editorial) rather than into trying to duck
such responsibilities ivith inconsistent and
inaccurate comparisons to "professional"
publications. not only will the end product
be more prolessional. but you will have
tulhllcd the basic responsibilities oi any
editor 7 professional or amateur 7 and
that. my iriend. is professionalism
