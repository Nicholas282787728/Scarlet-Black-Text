Some or us inc hcre tor the college,

some live hero [or both: for Grinnell the
college, and for Grinnell the town. A link
between the two interdependent worlds,
Ed Brand has hCCn both a worker {or the
college's Building and Grnund‘s lB&Gl
Department since 1981 and an integral
part ol the Grinnell city- management
Sinci’ 1978.

Brand described the mic world as one
built on cooper ion and one where all
members enjoy working together He said.
"We all get together. we eat together .

iiill, We are always in tor a lot or laughs.
it's an enjoyment to uork here because we
got along so well My theory is it you can
cooperate. you Lrin operate. But ii you
can't cooperate. nothing will function. We

Yet, he also lives in an entirely different'
uorld; the political art-nu ot the Grinnell
community.

when he was till a supervisor at the
Midwest Manulacturing Company in
Kellogg. lowa. Brand was appointed to the
Board oi Adiustment (BOA) by lormer
Ma'yor Floyd Bever in 1973 During his
tour ear term. Brand heard appeals

quest to huild a house extension for his/her

For Brand. as it had been [or other
tormer board members. including current
Mayor Dave McConnell. the BOA served
, . stepping stone to a higher position in

tv management "I got interested in it
ici y managementi. and thereiore. alter
the iBt)Al term was up. I decided to try to
run lnr lCIty] Council." said Brand.

Brand explained that running for city
council was .i simple procedure, open to
‘dny interested Grinliell citizen. By attainr
mg fifteen to twenty signatures, Brand
secured his nomination tor a pos on.on
lht- council ln 1982. Brand won the election
by nearly 100 Votes. and was established as
A member ol the countll tor the third ward.
"i The election clcarly I showed that people

his [Win by "looking tor a morc icasihle.

a real step in the right direction, so i took

According to Brand 'ilter discussing the
advantages to such a truck, and nnding
one in use in Muscatine. lowa. the Council
"started shopping {or one, bought one. and
put the thing to work. They are still work-
ing beautilully " Consequently, on Brand's
initiative. the city eliminated the need for
an additional trash collector. who was then
placed in another street department posir
non. Moreover. as Brand explained. "not
only [was the new truck] a savmgs to the
City. but it eliminated a hazard "

Perha most significantly. Brand's
lurm coin (led with Grinnell‘s ellorts to
rcyamp the sewer and water systems, The
Environmental Protection Agency tEPAl
“clamped down on Grinnell. [in order tor
Grinnelll to be [the EPA‘SJ number one
constituent. They are requiring that Grinr
lit-ll replace its sewer and water systems
liy 1983 " Brand explained.

Fulti ing such a demand will cost Grin-
nell approxxmately $5 million dollars.
Agreeing that such a project is necessary.
Brand said the “sewers are really bad,
They should have been replaced long ago,
