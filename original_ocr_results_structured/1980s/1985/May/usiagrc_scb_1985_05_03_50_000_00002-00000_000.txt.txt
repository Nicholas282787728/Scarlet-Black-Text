”l didn't dream of coming back here.
I only had planned to stay three years ,.
. Somehow. i didn't stay only three
years." said Joseph F, Wall. retiring
Rosenlleld Professor and Director of
the Rosenl’ield Public Affairs Program.
No. he didn't stay lor only three years;
in fact. having been gradudated from
the college in 1941. Wall has been at-
filiated \vith Grinnell for nearly so
years as either a student, professor. or
dean.

After graduating lrorn Grinncll. Wall
attended Harvard graduate school. ma-
joring in American Colonial History.
Literally in the nick of time. Wall took
his linal exam and got his MA. on a Frir
day in 1542. and was in the Navy the
ioiiowing Sunday. staying there until
1946. After his interim in the Navy. Wall
attended graduate school at Columbia
UniverSity. where he earned his PhD.
in 19th century American History.

It was at that point that Wall came
back to Grinnell as a professor. though
he had no intention ol staying, Return
ing to an unchanged History depart
ment. Wall had planned to use Grinnell
as a place to acquire experience; as a
stepping stone. However, as Wall ex
plained. Jobs were scarce in the 1950's
and he could not risk leaving the col»
lege. Furthermore. when jobs did
become available. he wanted and chose
to stay.

Until 19139. Wall continued to teach. In
that year. Wall became Dean of the Col-
lege. a position he held tor four years.
or those years, Wall said. “they were
very exciting and very exhausting
years. it was great experience." Dur-
ing his position as dean. rellecting and
contributing to society's social
changes. the college dissolved all core
requirements and introduced the pre-
sent open curriculum and mandatory
freshmen tutorial

However. for Wall. his ads
ministrative position had its
drawbacks. By 1973, Wall said, he had
"had enough administrative duties. I
wanted to get back to teaching and
writing, [This position] took me away
irom what i enjoyed. I was ready to
come back to more scholarly pursuits."

Leaving Grinnell altogether. Wall.
sold his ho'use in 1973 and took a teach-
ing position at SUNYrAlbany. in
New York. It was there. Wall said. that
he “intended to finish his ciiireerH of
teaching and writing. But once again,
plans changed.

In 1979. when Gcorgc Drake. a tormcr
student of Wall's. became President of
the college. Wall was asked to return to

Grinnell to head the Hosenfield Pro-
gram tnamed alter Joseph Rosenlieldt.
Thiis.‘ alter spending only two years in
Albany. the place where hc had intend
ed to ‘finish his career.’ Wall came
back to Grinnell on the agrecmcnt. that
he would teach one course a semester.
and chair the Roscnfield Program.

For the past five years. that is exact»
ly what he has been doing talthough
this semester he is teaching two
courses: ”Nuclear Weapons" and
“American Civilization." Wall said of
his current position." lit is] exciting
and highly enjoyable." for two reasons.
First. through the Roseniield Program.
he is able to “organize distinguished
people and can get to know them brlef'
ly.” Wall said. Furthermore. helikes to
chair the program because it is conr
cerned with what he finds to he in
teresting: political and international at»
fairs. and human rights.

Wall is not retiring out of boredom. he
now intends to work on a major book
that he has been working on tor the past
ten years. This book is a biography of
Albert 1. Dupont. who made Dupont
Chemical into the huge corporation it is
today. In her will. Dupont's wife left
iunds tor research into a biography of
her husband Wall was chosen to write
that biography. which required him to
travel extensively to Delaware and
Florida.

By no means is this his first book;
Wall had published several others bet-
ween the years 1956 and 1979. and this
year. his book Skibo. a history of lhe
Socttish castle. was released, His
favorite biography. for which Wall was
awarded the Bancroft Prize in History.
is Andrew Carnegie printed in tow,

Having seriously considered going to
law school. Wall said that one. “can
develop intellectual ideas in a less
adversarial role.“ such as teaching.
Teaching history. specirically, allows
for the development of more ideas both
on the part oi the student and the pro-
lessor. Wall said. Because of his in-
terest in civil rights. Wall's favorite
course to teach was American Constitu-
tional History

When asked whether he has influenc»
ed students. Wall said that. “One
always hopes to have inllucncc over
students. That is the great reward of
teaching. Unlike books that leave
behind scholarly pursuits. teachers do
have a very real impact on students."
In turn. Wall also said that. “I think the
best teaching is interaction of faculty
and students. part ol the whole learning
process is interaction. I‘ve always ielt

that I've learned from my students
great deal,"

Although upperclassmen take poi

older and past classes. Wall does‘

said in that context. "Ithere is al Inr'l

Concerning current student politi
