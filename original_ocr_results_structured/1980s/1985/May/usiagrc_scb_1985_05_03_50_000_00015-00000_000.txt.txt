The tirst periormance oi Plrates oi
Pcnzance was on December in. 1879 at
the Fifth Avenue Theater in New York,
Technically. the opening was held in the
Bijou’l'heatre. Paignton. Devon the day
helorc. in compliance with the British
copyright law. The law. however. was
avoided and the ﬁrst periormance of
pirates has the distinction or being the
only Gilbert and Sullivan musical to
open in the United States.

The music to Pirates of Pcnzance has
a much more operatic quality than any
01 the previous Gilbert and Sullivan
musicalsThisstyle Caused problemsin
the original performances because
muSicians for operas were paid more
than musicians for operettas, The
members of the New York orchestra
claimed that Pirates was an opera and
threatened to strike unless they receivV
ed more pay.

Sullivan answered the threat by air

nouncing he would bring the orchestra .

oi the Royal Opera House. Covent
Garden. to play for the musical. He said
that the orchestra had nothing better to
do until the beginning at the opera

on the piano. and a friend DI his (in the
harmonium.

Fortunatzly. the American muSlcians
backed (lewn. A relieved Sullivan later
admitted. “the idea oi getting the Co
vent Gardent band over was hardly less
absurd than the ludicrous idea of using
the piano and harmonium in a big
theatre."

The musical score for Pirates caused
conflict not only between Sullivan and
musicians. but also between Gilbert
and Sullivan. Sullivan felt he should be
spending his energies on something
more significant than comedic musical
theatre. Many or his contemporaries
agreed with Sullivan and some Critics
thought Sullivan had enough talent to
compose serious operas. Sullivan dld
compose some operas and a few symr
phonics. but none brought hiln as much
success as his collaborations with
Gilbert.

Gilbert's firsl yearning was not inr
musical comedy either. Gilbert was a
poet as well as a London bannister.
After one of his clients thanked him for
his legal services by smashing her boot
down on his head. Gilbert retired from
courtroom work and began to publish

.his poems. The poems were printed in

London magazines and Gilbert often
returned to his ballads for ideas to use
in his musicals. The jokes surrounding
Ruth's age in Pirates. [or example.
were loreshadowed in Gilbert's ballad
"Haunted".

Gilbert's satire and “subtle” humor,
mixed with the quality at Sullivan‘s
musical composition. makes Pirates 3
fun and entertaining Show. Pirates tells
the story of Frederick. an apprenticed
plrate. Frederick gains his treedom
from his orphaned pirate pals when he
comes of age and departs in search of a
beautiful maiden and love.

Instead of one beautilul maiden.
Frederick finds twelve beautiful wards
oi the modern MajnrrGeneral Stanley.
The trrluble begins when Frederick's
pirate friends also find the General's
wards Add to this Frederick's very lnv-
ing nurse. a squad of terrified
policemen and a confusion in birth
dates and the excitement of the Pirates
of Penzance has just begun.

General Stanley. Frank BnChter ls the
