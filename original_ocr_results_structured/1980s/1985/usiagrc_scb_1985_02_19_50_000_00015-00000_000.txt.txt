. 1 am responding to Mr. Todd Perry's
“interView” with myseli in your February

cruise misslt .ssue. Mr. Perry asked tne
loaded question “But do we want to pro
duce cruise missiles so that we W|ll never
be able to verify an arms control treaty
with the Russians 'v" and told the cam-
pus that my iustitication tor such a wapon
was simply “Oh, but the Soviets don't want
real arms control treaties, They're only the
terested in attaining arms agreements
which put them in a position or
superiority.” in tact. l expressly told Mr.
Per‘ry that 1) the Sovtels are not interested
lll arms Control per se 2) Thus their recent
retusai to negotiate in good taith which 3)
casts our nuclear relationship into a more
purely deterrance character which 4)
necessitates a credible deterrant such as
that which the cruise missile provides, i
iurther told Mr. Perry that cruise missiles
could be veritied through onesite inspece
tion and an “opensky” policy, and that I
had no objections to either. If Mr. Perry
prints his questions, I feel the least he
could do would be to print my replies.
Apparently these subtleties (as well as
those dealing with almost 'all the other

issues we discussed) were not' considered
important by Mr, Perry. who instead
chose to print his own version of my vieivs:
Perhaps this is why our interview lasted.
