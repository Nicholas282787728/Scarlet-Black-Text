Walk.”

The journey began this past September
when Michel Montiot. former French pro-
fessor at Carleton College, left Min-
neapolis to walk two thousand miles to Log
Angelcs Michel is a Victim of Parkinson's
disease. Last Thursday he came through
Gl'ilincll and stopped in the College Forum
to distribute pamphlets and talk with
students about the disease.

e1 calls his jouri “The Road to

Dignity Walk" and sztys This is the way I
have found to help researchers lind a cure
for inc and for all the others who have
Parkinson's disease." On his arrival in Los
Angeles. he hopes to have raised one
million dollars for research into the cause
and possible cure oi the disease.

The American Parkinson's Disease
Association, founded in 1961 to “ease the

‘burden and find the cure" of Parkinson's

disease. is sponsoring the walk. TheAPDA
will both receive the money from con-
tributors and award grants to promising
research projects. all or which will be air
iiliated with major hospitals or univer-
sities.

Equally important is Michel's aim to
raise public awareness of Parkinson's
disease and the debilitating effects it can
produce in the patient's life A total of 1.5
million Americans are ViCtlmS of Parkin-
son's disease. a figure that exceeds the
combined number oi people sultering from
either multiple sclerosis. muscular
dystrophy or Lou Gehrig‘s disease. And
yet Parkinson s remains a relatively
anonymous disease and many doctors ex-
perience diiiicu’ity diagnosing it

Parkinson 5 disease exists when brain
communications involving balance, move-
ment. walking and speech are hindered by
damage to brain cells. alid the absence of

thc communicating chemical, dopamine.
Symptoms progress from iatigue and
iieakiiess in the ear stages to almost
complete loss ot movement control in the
later stages

Michel has many oi the classic symp

and sluvi. difficult walking He now takes
the chemical. levodopa. which helps his
brain tuiiction properly But this is only a
temporary remedy Levodopa has side ei-
fects and after livc years or less the
lei-odopa honeymoon ends and many oi
the symptoms oi the illness return in tull
force.

Michel. who is now forty-five years old.
Continued to teach even after he began to
experience the effects of Parkinson s The
Carleton College administration allowed
his wife to assist him in the classroom
With the added Coopcration of his col-
leagues and students he viorked until this
year when finally he was foiced to retire

ln ordei to remain fit. and train f0] the
trek across the country. he jogged three
times a week. walked daily and performed
stretches to keep his muscles flexible. Dur-
ing the next few months and travelling fif-
teen miles a day. Michel will pass south
through Missouri to Texas and then cone
tinue west through New Mexico and tinaliy
Calirornia. The Road to Dignity Walk will
end in late January 1936.

An arduous journey tor eveli a healthy
individual. Michel Monnot’s walk is a
tremendous challenge for any sufferer of
Parkinson's disease. Haunted by the fact
that his symptoms will only get worse,
Michel walks for a Cure. before
Parkinson’s disease eventually keeps him
ii-om walking at all. \
