Make The Difference Now

‘Though it isn’t, the campus should be alive with a

discussion about two important ballots coming up
the near future.

tThursday, the student body will vote on the first
two items tried in the first run of the new system of

ampus—wide referendum Next week, we elect our
next Student Government Association President
and Vice»President.

Both SGA and the new referendum systan have
been called big jokes. The presidency has been
deriddenras a do-nothing position which is not taken
seriously by the administration while the referen-
d in has been cut down as just another chance for
those in love with beauracracy to have their fun.

‘Some have also said that the referendum poses a
serious danger in that, by placing their names on
“the list," students may be jeopardiziig their
future credibility in the eyes of employers and
government officials.

.Well, we guess that it is therefore safe to assume

of Brown University who have come out with
strong statements against nuclear armament,
most notably their request that their book store be
stocked wiﬂl “suicide pills” to be used in theadvent
of war, have black-listed themselves out of the
economy.

A referendum and the subsequent statement
issued by SGA probably won’t make that much dif-
ference in our futures but the exercise will make a
great difference now in raising our collective con-
scious on the issues in Central America and South
Africa — issues the rest of the world is thinking
about.

As for the SGA presidency, if there is a joke or
some irony to be found, it is in the fact mat the stu-
dent life at Grinnell has left so much to be desired
for so many of us. This year we have watched SGA
become more of a student service. We suggest that
we keep the ball rolling for next year so that no stu-
dent should ever have to decide between buying
books and dropping a class; going to the pub or go-
ing crazy. Enough said: Vote.

surely, ore editor would not preiace the ari

motif clearly conveys this message. This
shabby treatment or conservative writers
will not promote the editor’s stated goal of
attracting members oi “the conservative

intelligentsia" to the so (See the so

11/2/84). Does the editor so fear the re
suasweness of conservative ideas that he
feels compelled to deny conservatism a
fair chance to compete on “the
marketplace of ideas.” Perhaps. the
editor, Robert 0. Quashie, should add his
name to the list of those who are acting in a,
manner which is unhealthy for the campus
community . namely discouraging the free
