Summer Ill tirlnnell:

n i Cathy Balduili

Wouldn't you Jusl love to spend the en
the your in the city oi Grlnlicll'.’ Well.
maybe the thought oi being here
throughout your summer vacation doesn't
a ppeal to you, but some iolks did just that:

they lived and worked in Grllmell over the.

summer.

Donnie Cotter. a chem major. worked in
Chemistry Research over this past sums
mer and iouncl it very rewarding. When
asked what motivated him to slay, he
replied. “Well. you get a sixteen hundred
dollar stipend which isn't too bad."

in addition. he explained'lhal one can
earn Credits required for the chemistry
m ayor, as well as have the extra time in
research which isn't available during the
school year while carrying a full course
load

“You can get a whole lot deeper into a
project." Cotler said

His social life didn't suffer too much.
either. Cotter mentioned that he still got
h onic tor a couple oi weeks. and although
the college supported activiti are gone in
the summer and “the town itself was not
that exciting." he still could keep himseli
entertained with picnics, bowling and go
ing to the bar.

Coller also played on the Chemistry
D epartment's softball team. the Distillers.
Though the team's record was not over
w helming. Cotter remembered having
won three games before he left for home.
“it was something that made the summer
fun.”

in its entirety. while restructuring the in-
terlor partitions to meet the new needs of
the offices.” The interior though. will still
enjoy a retention oi the 19th century ar»
chitecture where feasible,

The 18 and 14 inch thick brick walls, and
a surprising amount oi original concrete
support under the foundation's iootings. in-
spired Walt McCraCken. General Contrac-
tor of the Mears project. to say. “er5
was a good. solid building beiore we
started.” Joe McElroy. Supervisor of the
physical plant likened the massive stone
support structure or the basement to a
“dungeon".

The major structural work is in “beefing
up the floors” with new wood and steel.
and constructing a new supporl system
which transfers much of the load to the
central elevator Shaft. The floor of the 1903
addition had to be excavated 3 feet to make
all floors level.

Patching and replacing brick in the ex-
terior walls was completed using a sur-
prise discovery of a ioo-year-old-brick
floor .in the southern basement; a lucky
(ind. (or the matching of bricks was an-
ticipated as a major problem in the ex»
terior work. The masonry will be covered
with a silicon sealer ior preservation.

As for the rest of the exterior. a slate
shingled roof. copper covers on the pro
lrudiiig windows. the replacement of the
front porch. a refurbishing of all of the

llie team was a part oi Gilliiiell s “C
league. and Cottcr. who played eitlicr right
llcld oi second base recalled 'We had to
k ecp our collccllvc sense or humor . We
ii ll had a wonderful time It was certainly
llOli'ilC‘aKlelnlC "

Katliy Dowd. who also worked in Grin-
ncll over the summer. commented that.
"You hail to look for [entertainment].
because it certainly wouldn't look for
you!"

Dowd. who worked as the leader of a
dctasseling crew hired by‘DcKalb. said
that her experiences in Grinnell ovcr the
summer were also very positive. despite
the mainly “hot. itchy" conditions or the
work. She also worked on campus but ex-
pressed that it was not as iun as working in
the fields with her crew

Dowd was particularly impressed with
the “townies” that she worked with and
got to know over the course of the summer

“There are a lot or preconceptions about
townies which are really incorrect. They
have a lot oi preconceptions about us, but
they‘re really nice people." Dowd said.

Dowd mentioned she misses the work as
w ell as the people who worked under her.
She indicated that she found the work
“Very relaxing,"

A similar opinion was described by
a nolher worker. Shannon Kelly, Kelly said
that a lot or people think oi Grinnell as
“that boring little place." but all it really
takes to work in Urlnnell is a “positive at-
litude,”

woodwork. and new Pella windows (which
are intricate replicas of the originals) will
give Mears an enduring. restored face.

Features such as an elevator aii condir
tioning. accessibility for the handicapped
and telephones will be new to Mears Hall.
but care is being taken to inlegrate the
conveniences oi the lows with the Vicr
torian ambience of the 1880's.

’l‘o accompany the Mears location oi thi-

admissions oiiice a parking lot will or
built in the grassy area to the Southwest 01
Mears: along sth Avenue and the train
tracks. The lot will be nested among the
trees. (No trees will be removed or harm-
edt.

As soon as the renovation is completed
7 May '36, the summertime transier oi oi-
times will begin, The revived Mears will
utilize the basement for storage. and the
first floor for an admissions conference
room. kitchen. prospective student waiting
room/gallery. and the general processing
area. The second floor will house addi»
tional office space for admissions; and the
third floor will have the new uffices for
Career Development. and the College
Research and Planning Office, with excess
space oi presently undecided use.

The resurrection of Mears is another
link in the “Grinnell continuum": a direct
link to the college's past. becoming a link
to its future

malion. as well as entertainment and news
of the outside world.

Walking at their own pace along the
shoulders of safe and scenic highways. the
marchers will be provided with vitamins
and supplements prepared especially for
long periods oi exercise. Upon arrival at
the evening campsite. the marchers will
turn their backpacks into folding chairs
and relax.

Upon waking up. according to Perkins.
the marchers will gather for breakfast in
the caleteria tent of one of six interconr
.nected “towns." Once on the way, they will
tulle their portable stereos to the PRO-
Peacc radio station. a traveling signal pro»

oi lite on the road.

Although selfrconlained. The Great
Peace March will in no way be isolated
lrom the cities and towns it passes
through. “Victims of radiation from
atomic testing will lead the marchrs
through St. George. Utah.” explains Tim
Carpenter, PROrPeace Field Director.
"An elderly woman in Springdale. Utah
has pledged to enlist all three hundred peo-
ple in her town tor a big party when we ar-
rive. In Denver. there will be a ticker tape
parade. Church bells will ring. Wherever
we go, both children and adults will line
the streets to demonstrate their support."

As a mobile village. The Great Peace
March will actually be larger than many oi
the communities along the route. During
the course of the March. close to four
million meals will be served. more than
one million showers Will be taken. over
40.000 shoes Will be worn out. and 2.500
tents will be set up and taken down daily.

"However. don't think we will leave
aiiyuiing but inspiration behind." warns
Steve Perkins. "We will use electric cars
ior much oi our shuttling, no live plant liie
will be cleared. people power. instead of
machinery. will accomplish most of the
work. and a conservation corps will scour
each site once the March moves on. Ens
vii'onmcntal protection is a major
priority'

there. Kelly explained

w orthwhile experience?
"Yell. it was great! " Shannon enthused
"I‘d do it again ”,Kathy Dowd assured
"It was a good experiencc." remarked
D onllie Cotter

Because at least one third of the mar-
chers are expected to come from the col-
lege population. PROrPeace is pleased to
have the support oi the U5 student
Association. two hundred student leaders.
and five stale student coalitions,
Altogether: these campus endorsements
represent more than two million students

In addition. theentertamment communi-
[3' has demonstrated strong commitment
through numerous beneiits and funr
di‘aisers. Celebrities for the March include
Paul Newman. Richard Dreyfus. Jack
Lemmon. Ed Asher, Leonard Nimoy. Jodi
Foster. and Judd Nelson,

Beyond endorsements. individuals and
organizations are getting involved. by conr
tributingmoney tor March supplies. (in a
grand scale. universities such as Harvard
and use have pledged to pay tor the large
medical and community service tents.

On a person to person level. those who
can't come along are participating in the
Adopter-Marcher program. in exchange
fur a contribution of a dollar per mile m
the total or one marcher's costs 7 spoils
sors will receive letters and photos from
their adoptecs. as well as an invitation to
join the liiarcli for an in person Visit Dona
tions to pay {or tents and sleeping bags are
also being sought.

To find the five thousand willing, able.
and committed people who will make up
the March, PRO-Peace is undertaking a
widespread recruitment campaign this
tall. Teams with banners alld tents will ap~
pear on college campuses ads will be plac-
ed in newspapers and magazines. radio
arid television features will air. lil-
dividuals will be asked to “Put Yourself
(In The Line" 7 the 3.235 mile line. that is .
— and Cities around the country will be
asked to “Step Forward';' for The Great
Peace March.

Surely David Mixner's niece. v'Jhcn Issu-
iiig her prophetic statement. had no idea
what a monumental undertaking would
result irom it. Says Mixner though.
“Never beiore in my 25 years oi organizing
has anything come together this easily.
Uptimism. idealism. energy — there's
more than enough to carry this thing
through."
