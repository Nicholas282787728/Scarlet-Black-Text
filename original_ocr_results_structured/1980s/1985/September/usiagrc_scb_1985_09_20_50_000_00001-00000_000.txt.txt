The increasingly high attrition rate at
black students at predominantly ivhite
liberal arts colleges, whatever the ex-
tenuating circumstances. is growing and is
cause for alarm." said Quentin Johnson,
Director of Minority Affairs.

The problem is intensilying, and in
response to it. Johnson is sponsoring the
National Conference on “The Recruitment
and Retention of Black students, Faculty,
and Staff on Predominantly White Liberal
Arts College Campuses," to be held on the
Grinnell campus September 26-28:

Staff, faculty and administrators from
approximately 50 midwest colleges Will at-
tend the conference. The American Coun~
oil of Education will also be represented.
Grinnell faculty will attend where their
schedules permit. Over the course of the
program, participants will attend various
workshops designed to focus on individual
aspects of the conlerence theme.

Thursday's lectures will be devoted to
the presentation of background informa-
tion and contemporary research of the pro-
blems of black integration into and an“,
tion from schools like Grinnell.
“Populated tnow), as they always have
been. by a large majority ol middle-class
students and stalled by white professors
and administrators,’ as Johnson
characterized.

To avoid spending time later in the con»
lerence identifying the problems, Tliul‘S'

day's lecturers will bring the problems up
to date by discussing cui-reiitstatistics and
issues.

“The problem is cyclical. Colleges like
Grinnell make attempts and begin to have
results that improve college campuses.
However. once results are seen. guards
are let down and efforts decrease, and con-
sequently, so does the percentage oi black
students. faculty, and staff, " Johnson ex-
plained.

Friday' 5 agenda will include several
task oriented workshops and a lecture In
these workshops. conference participants
“hope to address the issues and come up
with a usable and consistent plan for short
and long range improvement,” The plan
will consist of recommendations that will
come out of the Grinnell Minority Affairs
Conference Modeling Committee lModel-
ing Committe),

.Tlie Modeling Committee will then work
for several months researching and
developing -recommelldatiolis that were
made by the workshop participants. “We
really do tool that we will come up with
new insights that will benelit campuses
across the country,” Johnson said.

The GMACMC will be chaired by Dr.
Donald H. Smith. professor of education at
Barnard Baruch College in New York, and
president of the National Alliance of Black

Grinnell is growing in addition to the on»
goillg renovations ol Mears and Younkcr
Halls. a facility to house both the
psychology department and Computer
Services is presently in the planning
stages The building, which will be erected
next spring and summer. will alleviate the
crowding that these departments have
been facing.

The psychology department is located in
Goodnow Hall which contains approx-
imately 3,000 square feet of space. The pro-
posed building would allot approximately
14.0th square feet to psychology and 8.000
square feet to Computer Services.

Another factor that determined the need
of the (acuity is the safety of the main com
puter hardware. its present home. Darby
Gym, is a building with a wooden strucs
tiira lion-ever. President George Drake
said. "The essential need was for more
space lol' the psychology department "

T\\0 areas are being considered lor the
loc tioiloflhecomplex One isadjacent to
the science building. iii illc area lhat
presrntly contains the parking lot, The
other prospective location is directly east
(ll Dnr ‘Gyin. if the building is erected on
the latter location PreSldeni Drake said
that it might be connected to Darby.

The new building would contain
classrooms and labs in lhe psychology sec-
tion and classrooms and storage oi the
computers in the Computer Services sec
tion. More classrooms might be built in
Darby it the complex is united with the
gym. Drake also commented on the need
for a large lecture hall which, if added to
the plans, would bc located in the new
facility or in Darby.

‘ The estimated cost of the complex is
three million dollars. The funding. Drake
said. is to come. “mostly from gifts."

The late of Goodnow is uncertain.
Presently there are two plans, One is to
renovate the building and in it house facul-
l y olhces and seminar rooms. The other
plan would also include restoration as an
art gallery. The timetable is already pro-
gressing. with the preliminary planning
underway. ' ‘

This fall a committee of administrators
and faculty users will linallze the plans
and meet with the building architect.
Drake said. "I really want us to talk
through the plans in order to get just what
\\ 9 want." The construction will begin in
the spring once the bids have been recein

Honesty nullity, lliouiinl nest

This lull Grinnell li-eshnien are being res
(wired to complete an exercise in
academic honesty as a part of the
li'eshman tutorial. The exercise requires
t he students to solve four sample problems
in skills such as correct quotation ol

‘ sources and proper paraphrasing,

According to Protessor lra Strauber.
member of the Committee on Academic
Standing (CAS, last year the Committee
in ade some observations that led to the in-
s titution of thetnew policy.

First. the committee noticed that
students out of high school are often con-
lused about how to cite sources properly or
they simply don't know how to do so,
Strauber said.

’l‘hevcommltlee also observed that there
is no standard that is universally accepted
throughout the academic community.
Rules differ from discipline to discipline
a nd often vary within disciplines Strauber
noted.

Finally, Strauber stated that the CAS
felt this diversity ofrstandards within the
academic community further confused
students who lacked sufficient experience
to comply with the statements in the Stus
dent Handbook.

Considering these three observations,
the Committee drew the conclusion that a
“shared convention" was needed,
Strauber said. The plagiarism exercise
was developed to providethis common ex~
perience to all new Grinnellians,

Freshman reaction to the exercise has

been mainly negative. New students had a
n umhcr oi objections concerning the exeiu
c isc

Many objected to completing exercises
in an area in which they al‘ready felt they
w oi c pl ol‘icient One student called the ex»

, crcise "so basic it‘s pathetic.”

Still others lclt that the purpose or the
exercise was unclear. "Thagwas the
stupidest exercise, -'l‘hey gave us
something to write on without giving us the
details." stated freshman John Beaver.

A few freshman. at least, thought there
was some value to the assignment. One
who found the problems valuable called
the assignment “boring but helpful."

Strauber said that he was not aware of
laculty objection to the exercise He said
that no'one complained at a meeting oi the
tutorial advisers. ”I take silence as ap-
proval," Strauber said.

Students in French Professor Morris
P arslow’s tutorial will not complete the ex
ercise. Parslow said he did not object to
the exercise in principle, bu: that the cons
tent of the exercise was not suited to his
tutorial. Parslow felt that the exercise was
just “a more forceful way [than the state-
in cut in the student Handbook] oi bringing
Sludents’ attention” to the problem of
plagiarism. Parslow had his students read

' through the exercise but did not require

them to complete it. However, the students
d id have to sign a statement that they had .
