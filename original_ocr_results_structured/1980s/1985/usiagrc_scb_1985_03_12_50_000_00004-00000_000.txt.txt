A LITTLE Story

Once upon a time there was a ball. And, to this
ball came a student who should have known bet-
ter. Rolling up right in front of a cop: a cop
dressed out just shy of riot readiness, was ship id.
To some observers, the gallant cop, night stick at
his side, his bullet proof vest in position anti ser-
vice revolver secured in its holster, acted kindly
by only confiscating the student’s pot and not
busting the student. To these, the cops acted
kindly when they only “asked” that the gym be
cleared a half hour early.

Some beg to differ.

The setting for this tale was Darby Gym-
nasium, Saturday, during the Loose Hall Ball.
The student, was of course, a member of this
campus community. The police officer was a
member of the Grinnell Auxiliary Police Force
and was not on regular duty.

This office;r plus four others, had been hired by
the college and student government to provide
support to the student security force whose pur-
pose is to protect the college from liability by
pretending to protect the student body from
substance and physical abuse Usually the stu-
dent security does a good job in pretending and
has actually averted some nasty incidents

But last weekend, the auxiliary poliCE, who by
definition are not certified police officers, back-
ed up this pretence with real guns, real bullets,
real night sticks. When, within the context of a
Grinnell party, would the security force need to
“Bust Heads?" When would they need to shoot
anyone? When would the college, a hall president
or resident advisor feel justified in asking me or
five non-certified men to open fire in a crowded
gym?

It may be argued that the auxiliary officers
were dressed in standard operating gear for
police people and that the officer was actinlzwell
within his duty when he seized the pot But, does
the college want policing or security at its
events? If the college wants security then the of-
ficer walked all over the agreement worked out
by Dean Tederman, SGA President Goldai and
the auxiliary force. Furthermore it is foolish to
ask the students, through SGA, to pay to get
busted.

The only solution to the security “problem” on
campus is to hire a private firm. Hire the kind
which we see at most rock concerts in most ma»
jor cities‘: The kind without guns and without
night sticks 7 The kind who call trained ofﬁcers
it something serious does happen.

But if the college is after police action, then
that is another story.

As a member ol Judictal Council
