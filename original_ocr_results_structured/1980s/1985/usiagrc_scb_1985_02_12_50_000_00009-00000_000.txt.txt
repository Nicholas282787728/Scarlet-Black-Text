To the Editor.

in the t . issue ol this semester, you
chose to devote your column to an attack
on the actions and motives ol the group of
students participating in the so-called
"t'ounterrdemonstralion " lo the process.
a small inconsistency cropped up. Alter
labelling the Sullivan Accords “lame
duck." you. as well as Leslie ltagan
elsewhere in the issue, went on to say that
the Sullivan Accords are part oi what SEA
wants, anyiiay.

With this remarkable pirouette, you us»

groups seek tlic same end. but to attack the

To the Editor: -

The last two editors-inchiel of the 5&8
criticized some student government ac-
tions tor which I was largely responsible

The [act that these editorials were elthel'

My point is that their sense of “prints
stonallsm' did not dip so low as to delamc
me by printing my name

Unfortunately in last week's editorial ‘d

College New Service that had already. in

Theretore. space was not a problem.

Many years ago the Sims would publish,
