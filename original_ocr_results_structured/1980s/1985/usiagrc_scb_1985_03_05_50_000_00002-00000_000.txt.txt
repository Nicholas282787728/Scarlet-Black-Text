PJ.’ Waller on English rioting

By Mark Schumann

British authorities throughout
modern hismry have responded to
violence with methods that were more
subtle than brutal, said Oxford
historian PJ. Waller.

He quoted one Duke of Wellington as
saying he would “leave plenty of room
for [the rioters] to run away,“

Waller delivered two lectures last
week during his visit to Grinnell. Cur»
rently a visiting professor of history at
Colorado College, Waller spoke on
”Speech and Class: Democracy and the
Decline of Dialect in England 7
1850-1930" and on “From Trafalgar
Square to Toxteth: 100 Years of English
Rioting.”

The first address considered the
changes in English dialect that have oer
curred since the eighteenth century and
the importance of language to class in
British society. He called language “a
tool of communication and excom-
munication." telling how speech, yust
as dress and manner. was and still is a
sign oi social class. occupation. and
status.

Waller showed no patience with that
“school of piddling and niggling" that,
in a “snobbish and arbitrary" way, still
tries to keep English speech in the nine-
teenth century. He attacked past and

Referendum

by Paula Rue

Students voiced their disapproval of
U.S. involvement in Central America
and Grinnell investmentln South Africa
with an overwhelming positive vote in
support of two Student Government
Association referendums.

Nearly 50 percent or the student body
voted on the firstrtime student referenr
dums. Although attempts have been
made during past semesters to derive a
unified student opinion on the two
issues, neither was able to pass a vote
in Joint Board.

The referendum on Central America
passed with a total of 401 affirmative
votes. against 103 negative votes, The
referendum on Grinnell College in
volvement with South African comr
panies passed with 436 affirmative
votes against 74 negative votes.

According to SGA President Matt
Golden, the proposal on Central
American was mainly the idea of the
campus Central American Support
Group. The referendum featured four
main points that students should have

present scholars who Wished to keep the
language from changing as
“philologically unscientific” and arr
rogant.

In his later lecture concerned the
changing causes and nature of riots in
England since the eighteenth century

The riots of the 1700's, Waller said,
were of several sorts ~ election riots,
radical riots. reaction riots 7 but by far
the most common was the food riot.
Food then was not necessarily short in
supply but was badly distributed. he
said. The poor hoped to use violence to
gain a better share of the food they
needed.

taken into account when voting.

The main belief Was that students
oppose both covert and overt military
intervention on the United States part
in Central American affairs. in accor
dance with that statement. the majority
view on campus is that:

1. No United States troops should be
sent Central Amerlca.

2. The United States should not. pro-
vide aid to the Nicaraguan “contras,”

3, The United States should
regularize its diplomatic relations with
Nicaragua and,

4. The financial assistance to the
military in Central American nations
should be based on their respective
governments‘ improved respect for
human rights.

With this statement, in order to pm,
mote longterm U.S. interests. the
students have made it clear that their
representatives should abide by these
principles when formulating U.S.
policy.

“A lot of input for the South Africa
referendum came from the Studean to

The nineteenth century. with its ”3“,
ing real wages and better supply and
distribution of food over canals and
roadways, sav. rioters attacking las it

Religious and economic concerns took
over while Welsh nationalists rioted lor
independence from England,

Waller asked why. when violence uas
so pleiititul in England's past. was
there no revolution. especially con»
siderlng the tide of rebellion that was
sweeping the Continent? Aiisu ering his
own question. he said "It may even be
argued that there was no real revolue
tionary threat."

Waller then cited factors that must be
present for a revolutionary movement
to gain lorce: 17 a breakdoun in the
legitimacy oi the state‘s authority; 2;
an inadequate response of the govern-
ment to that breakdown; 37 the support
or large numbers oi people in other
areas, and 4) and organized revoliL,

Visiting Heath Professor Shirley -
Williams, a former British Cabinet
member. related afterwards a story of
one of the “fashionable nearrrlots ol the
late 1960's" in which the United States
embassy in London was in danger ofbe-
ing stormed by rioters. By being very
careful not to exacerbate the crisis.
authorities were able to prevent a
dangerous escalation of violence shc

End Apartheid group," Golden said.
Based on the vote. the majority of
students are against South Africa's
racist system of apartheid, and want
the Board of Trustees. as well as the
representatives in the iederal,govern-~
ment to lake active measures to
eliminate that policy. ‘

The students wish to achieve these
goals in three ways.

1. The United States government
should reiuse to consider applications
of federal loans and work contracts
rroin iirrns currently in South trica
who do not comply with the Sul ivaii

Principles.

2 The United States government
should avmd all military and/or
strategic cooperation with the South
African government and.

3. There should be a cancellation of
all federal contracts with corporations
that provide equipment and services to
the South African military or police.

Both statements may be presented to
various U.S. congressmen. senators
and other government and mm,
government oiiicials.
