What’s going on!

NOW. I‘ve seen it all. The College Public
Relations people just came out with the
1986 wall calender, It's supposed to make
everyone go “Oooohhhl what a pretty
place! Let's go there " which is line by
me l'm perfectly willing to pin up some
propaganda on my wall - as long as it looks
decent. -

I should have known when I saw the
calendars at the bookstore that things
weren't all that simple, It seems that the
college thinks we should pay $6.95 to pin
their public relations on our walls. Like
Hell I will! lligured I was being a nice guy
by not making THEM pay ME for display-
ing their propaganda.

I know this is a silly little unimportant
issue. but I feel it demonstrates the men-
tality of the administration toward the
students in general,

Like student affairs building the Health
Center alternative bar without Clearing it
with SGA. and then getting all huffy that
we won‘t pay tor the damn thing,

Like the P.R, people tagaint having us
pay iiii the bookstore. again) lor those lite
lle college rear window stickers. i mean -
w E pay to do THEIR advertising? on our
Cars?

What's going on? Am I the only who's

,n oticed this?

Realism the

I too am appalled by hollow and
hypocritical commitments, It is {or this
reason that i am outraged by the
November 15 editorial entitled “DiveSt
completely.“ It is not the action of the
trustees that evokes this scorn but the
editorial itself. The problems are two-fold:
the hypocritical comments concerning
equality and the naivete with regard to the
potential effects oi divestment,

The article argues in favor of equality.
spccihcally, racial equality. Yet, it i
plicitly supports the turning away or
"qualified white Candidates in [the cola
lege's] search for a black professor” to fill
the Vacant Afro-American Studies posi'
tion, Perhaps Iain mistaken. but i thought
the college was searching for a proiessor
not a minority representative. Granted, a
qualified black professor would add diver-
sity to the iaculty. but the duties involved
with the AirorAmerican Studies position
are primarily those oi teaching. The selecc
tion process should emphasize those
qualifications over unrelated iactcrs such
as race. If our goal is to achieve equality
(the removal of race as a factor in decismn
making) shouldn’t we begin by removing
race as a qualification?

The argument is advanced, however,
that we must discriminate in favor of
minorities since past discrimination
against them has inhibited their com-
petitiveness. idon't know of anyone on this
campus. student or faculty member, that
believes Grinnell employs or admits any
non-competitive persons — minority or
otherwise, There was no reason to demean
the character oi the black applicants (or
blacks in general) by not allowing them to
compete lairiy against whites. The above
generalization about 'minorities is pro
blematic in itself One example should 3us
fice: a white female and a black male both
apply fora job; who should get it? Hopeful-

answer, not divestment

regarding the AlroAmerican position.

To those SAIB staffers whom I have not .

convinced i would pose this questio . How
many stall positions are tilled by
minorities? I contend that it should not
matter unless. oi course, present
discrimination has kept them out. But. if
the sol; is truly committed to equality
through discrimination. it should not have
opened up applications tor next year's
start to non~minorities. Such action.
howcver. would have been discriminatory
and would have implied that minorities
could not have competed with non-
minorities. This type 0! statement is ob-
v iously not the intended goal oi the policy
but is the result regardless

The first step to eliminating racial pre
yudice is to stop making race a primary
qualiﬁcationlnstead, firm efforts to seek
out minority candidates should be con-
tinued. obviously. we cannot simply close
our eyes to reality. ignoring the problem
won‘t make it go away.

Such naivete is just what complete
divestment proposals spring rorth lrorn.
Divestment is a moral action and not a
substantive one. Again. an example may
help: Why do those students who demand
complete divestment not “divest'
themselves from this college” The answer
is that they can be more ellective working
from a position or strength within the
system.

South Arrican Chier Gatsha Buthelzi has
stated the following: “Some of your
superliberals in America have got the
whole issue exactly upside down They
seem to think it is immoral for American
companies to invest here. but irresistably
prolitable. The truth is the opposite , . . My
people want you and need you here "
American companies have been benet ial
in a number of ways. Besides providing
blacks with real power in the form at in
creased purchasing power through black
employment. those companies also invest

gr atly in black schools and hospitals.

Even ir divestment were somehow able
to influence all u 5. companies to leave
south Alrica. would that be benclicial? i
agree with the experts who respond that it
would not When Pan Am recently discon-
tinued its Johannesburg run the effect was
soley to reduce competition and allow.
South Aii-ican Airways to drastically ins
Crease its market share SAA is even now
considering increasing its North American
service

The question is who will light Apartheid
more liercely: American companies that
a re accountable to lion-divested
stockholders or loreign corporations which
America has no control over? We should .,
not simply turn our backs in moral revul» .c
sion and believe Aparthcid will disappear
now that irc aren‘t prolihng, Economic
mai-tyrism is not the answer,

The trustees shouldhc applauded tor
their realism. While agreeing to divest
ri-om companies not tollowing the Sullivan
Accords for moral reasons, they have sug-
gested that the college community apply
real pressure by boycotting South African
supplied goods. Divestment itselt means
little since it is only a trade of stock tto sell
there must be a buyer). in fact, some com
panies have taken advantage of divest
merit moves by buying back Stock atpriccs
lower than which it was originally issued
all

The editorial in question has noble ends
but does not suggest credible means to
meet them. 1 agree that "Grinnell ought to
iollow its pioneering tradition and lead
American colleges and universities" not in
total divestment. however. but in realism.
T he trustees, [or whatever combination oi
reasons. have taken a step in that direcr

i lion. Total divestment (and further raClal

prejudice oi any sortl would be a step
backward.
