New men’s group

You have to have a penis to get in the
door. but once you're in, the at
mosphere oi the men's group is very
open and comiortable. according to
David Dixon, Providing a secure en-
vironment in which men can discuss
anything. especially things that are uni
que to men. the group is ‘new and imr
proved‘ this year.

Resurrected by Barry Edwards and
Dave Mathias. the men's group has
been expanded irom a small group of
close friends to a larger group which
encourages all males to participate.

“We have between ten to thirteen
people each week, but they are usually
not the same people every time.” said
Barry Edwards,

The inspiration {or the group came to
Edwards and Mathias after attending
“Rape Culture,” a film sponsored by
the women's group,

“After the film. the women really
opened up and i thought I’d like to talk
about those things as a man. There
were only a iew males there so 1 wasn’t
sure if there would be a demand [or this
type or group." stated Edwards.

According to Phronsie Kelly, the shift
of the group's focus lrom lesbian issues
to issues that face all women has reliev»
ed “a lot oi pressure.“

“Before. if you weren‘t a lesbian you
felt pressured and uncomfortable at
meetings. Now. there is a more open at
iiiosphere and although we are very
supportive oi each other. our main
locus is campus education," Kelly said.

As an educational [Drum for the cams

and films on women's sex roles and Sex
roles in general. pornography. *eating
disorders, abuse. and women's health
care. Attendance at ﬁlms and speakers
is usually around 75. including some
men. though the group's mailing list
contains over so names. Witonsky come
merited.

“We enyoy having men come to iilms
and we‘ve had some come to meetings
too.” Wltonsky said. ”One of the old

mind. Since women are not allowed, no
one feels impeded from being honest.
according to Edwards.

Women are OK but we don’t allow
them because they won't understand
us. This way it's very open.” said Dix-
on.

Though some members are opoosed

allowed at some of the meetings so as to
hear their views. Uli Knorr, also a

Most group members agreed that the
best thing about the group is the iree

“I’ve been to a lot oi groups and this
is the best of them. in its moments it
can be the greatest thing." Knorr said.

“At meetings we talk about anything
that concerns us. You can let out all of

“The meetings are fun. 1 used to enjoy
when men came. it was good to see
