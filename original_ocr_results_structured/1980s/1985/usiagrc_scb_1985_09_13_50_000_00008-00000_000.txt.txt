strength from a year ago, missing only
lour players who graduated in the spring.
“We got 18 ol our lettermen back,” says
PiiLsch. “including eight of last year's
starters and two from the year beiore
that.” This leaves them with experience
and depth, which Piitsch hopes will be put
to good use.

The schedule this year includes many
teams that Grinnell has not played
previously, like St. Mary's oiWinona, Min-
nesota. Pfitsch believes that meeting new
teams will help the team’s development,

team dropped their opening game to

Macalester College last weekend, 4313.

Players cited heat exhaustion, illness and '

bee stings in explanation of the defeat.

According to Coach John Martinek, the
team was “lackluster” and did not execute
plays with any consistency or enmusiasm.
Martinek stated that there were many
great individual efforts, but that “iootball
is a team sport. not an individual one.”

This was only the second year that Grin-
nell has faced Macalester. This year's
team is much stronger and deeper than
Grinnell has had in recent years.

But throughout the first half, Grinnell's
offense sputtered. The Pioneers suffered
six turnovers, A scoring drive finally came
in lour minutes during the third quarter.
Grinnell got on the board with a one yard
run by freshman Paul Manternach, On
dieir next possession, Grinnell scored on a
40 yard pass play from sophomore Rob
Lough to senior Steve Worth.

the College ol Wooster; and improve the
Pioneer’s national standing, which could
merit the invitation to the NCAA tourna-
ment that they narrowly missed in 1934,

Organization was still questionable the
week beiore the season opened, but junior
lorward-midiielder Erik Schwiebert
thought that any problems would- work
themselves out soon enough. “I think that
the talent and the psychological motlva~
tion is there," he said. “The team analyzed
the season, and we want to win all ol our
conlerence games and deiend the title.”

Coach l>litsch agreed. “It's a
challenge," he said, “and they're the ones
that have to kick the ball, but they’ve got a
lot oi potential.”

The Pioneers will begin the rough work
oi delending their championship title
tomorrow, when they lace Aurora College

The Grinnell College Rugby Team open-
ed its season last week in an away game
against Iowa Falls. The team, which is a
club at Grinnell, lost the game 1741, but
Coach/Captain Dave Klaiman stated that
“it was a good game and a great learning
experience."

The club is entering is let Season (two
seasons a year), The team consistently
places within the top five at the state tourr
nament, played in the spring. This year,
the fall team consists of between 20 and 25
players, eight oi whom are new this year.
The rugby team generally has more
players in the Spring, when the lall sports
players. usually iootball, and soccer, can
participate.

This season there are six townspeople
playing with Grinnell “There are plenty ol
people,” says Klaiman. although he added
that they could use somej‘bigger people."
However. needing larger people is the
least oi the team’s problems. Because
rugby is a club, rather than a varsity
sport, the Only contribution from the col-
lege is the standard $200, and the use of
fields during scheduled home games, and
practices when the fields are available.

Not only does the team have to pay lor
its own equipment. uniiorms. alld league
dues, but also it is responsible for its
transportation to away games, and for lin-
ing the licld and setting up goal posts tor
the home games. This year, as in the past.
the team is also having problems ﬁnding a
field on which to practice. They have had
to resort to using the “field” behind Norris
lor a practice area,

Klaiman expressed concern at
what he feels is “shoddy treatment." He
commented that the $200 was hardly ade-
quate coverage lor the team‘s most basic
needs. They must also pay ior relerces ior
each home game, in addition to their other
expenses,

In the past. the team has solicited and

received money lrom townspeople.
However, they have not received such con-
tributions the last three years, though last
year Fete St. Thomas, oi Grinnell, paid ior
18 new jerseys at a cost or almost $500,

Despite the problems the team laces, the
spirits remain high. When asked il he
would like Rugby to become a competitive
varsity sport Klaiman said “The beauty oi
the game is that it‘s competition ior the
sake oi competition, Uniortunately, that
isn't the case with the varsity sports at the
college. in what sport can you try your all
ior an minutes and then go party with the
guy who just kicked you in the head?“

Klaiman also added that lortunately “no
one is coming on an injury this year." He
hopes that there will be a large turnout lor
the iirst home game or the year, scheduled
ior September 21. on 10th Avenue at 11:00

The Women’s Tennis Team tested the
seasonal waters last Saturday against
Grandview. The Pioneers suffered a disap-
pointing loss, and the intense heat con-
tributed to the forfeit of one doubles
match. but overall, Coach Gar Smith was
pleased with the outcome oi the muggy
morning.

“Everyone was very much into the mat-
ches." he said. “Each point was very
close Their whole determination was
good." He explained the deieat saying,
“The games just ended too soon. just when
we got into rhythm.”

“We have a very fine team.:’ he con-
Llnued. “The opposing coach and a
longtime observer both commented that
our team 7 in terms oi court coverage, at-
titude. etc, 7 were better than they’d seen
in previous years."

The. women defeated Simpson on
Wednesday, and will meet Coe this Satur-
day in Cedar Rapids,

chii

Soccer and iootball will be played during
two separate months. Soccer will be
played in September. and iootball will
follow in October. Bianchi said the new

and ease the head Coordinator's direction
of the season. i

The point system remains unchanged:
wtnners ~10 points. second place » 8 points,
third and iourth place . 7 points, liith and
sixth place . ti- points. Other participating
teams receive 4 points. except iorieiting
teams, which get no points. i

Blanch! added that this year he would
like to emphasize increased student par-
ticipation in intramural: Dorm Coors
dinators should be enthusiastic, and more
women and ireshmen should get out and
play.

“People shouldn't be intimidated by a
sport that is meant to be fun and not overly
Competitive,” said Bianchi.
