while students were enjoying their vaCar
trons this summer, workers were busy
renovating Younker Hall, the college's
oldest dormitory.

The renovation of Younker Hall has been
a gradual process. taking place in three
stages. First. Younkcr's heating system
was refurbished. then. all windows were
replaced. and most recently. the central
core. north wing. and roof of the building
were renovated. The last step. the
remodelling of soulh Younker. is schedul~
ed to take place next summer.

Beginning last May 25th. the renovations
Continued until August 23rd. the day before
N eu' Student Days. According -to Dale
Ilawll. Director of the Physical Plant. the
project cost $494,520, It is estimated that
the work scheduled [or next semester will
cost $175,000 to $200,000

l-lawn predicts that the renovar

tion will last at least twenty years,
--depeiidiirg on the kind oi care it gets,"
Ted Klllker is enthusiastic about the recent
renovation. “'l'llls is my third year in
l’ounkcr and it’s nice to see the change.
it's not a dump anymore and will it
become the ”hot Spot" dorm to live i

review oi a waiting list. to limit the
number oi incoming ireshmen and ease
the iurther overcrowding This is merely a
suggestion by the Joint Board, because the
decision rests entirely in the hands oi the
Admisstons Board.

Student life Committee met during the
past week to discuss campus problems,
such as the pet policy. .

Curriculum Committee met with
members of the faculty to discuss the res
ouirements for minors and double majors.
They also entertained the idea oi pusliirig
back the deadline for pass/tail option

cessible to those students With Validated

the auditor should be turned into the Joint
Board tivo weeks prior to the event.

The Finance Committee rejected the‘
proposed budget or the Alice in

The Joint Board unanimously approved
the new proposed cover letter ior reieren—
da and holding oi the Presidential and the
Vice-Presidential elections on the same
day. the first Wednesday of March. but
both have to be approved a second time by
the Joint Board.

For those students Wishing to rent a
relrigerator, there are still 40 remaining
units Contact the SGA for turther infor-
mation.

The alterations in Younker include the
elimination or gang showers and the
separation or single bathrooms into two
separate ones.

Alan Moore. the Student Advisor in
South Pit. ieels that “it is ridiculous to
have two phones and no water iountain on
a floor." in response to changes resulting
trom the renovation.

"I lived in Clark last year. the dorm with
sinks in the rooms. and i think they should
have them in Younker. too. Otherwise. l
lllink the renovation is great," comments
Steve Wei-sch, a sophomore living on
N ortli Younker Second

Mr, Hawn said that the cost oi installing
sinks in each room is too extensive Ins
stead. the planners have opted for more
extensive central bathroom lacrlities.

other changes have included replacing
the mud path on the north side oi Younker
with a courtyard that will soon be corn
par-able to that in irorit ol Norris New
iloors. and painting suriaces have also
been installed throughout the dorm lnr
sulation has been added in the attic and the
original panelling has been replaced with
darker viood so as to add more character

Leann demands moratorium
on all lat-m [III'BBIOSIII'BS

Congressman Jim Leach (R-lAl. last
Monday. called on the Farm Credit Ad-
ministration toplace a moratorium on all
farm foreclosures until Congress takes ac-
tion to restore the system's solvency.

Officials of the Farm Credit Administrar
tion have said recently that the $74 billion
System is insolvent and will need federal
assistance to survive. In the meantime.
the system is contemplating a massive
loreclosure policy to consolidate financial
resources.

‘ “The soctal purpose of establishing the
F arm Credit System In the first place was
lu save farms. not dissolve them.” Leach
S aid ”The System should not be allowed to
tor-ego its original purpose unless and until
Congress gives its oiiicial sanction.“

Under the Leach plan. the bondholders
rather than taxpayers would pick up the
lab tor saving the system A new Earn]
Credit Author \' uould be established to
audit the t‘ulltlii tiiiaiicial posiiion oi the

F arln Credit System and, in a return lor a
government guarantee. discount
presentlyrhcld bonds, The system would
then be reconstituted with more prudent
rn anagemcnt guidelines and iairly ap~
praised assets.

Because of the government guarantee.
confidence would be reestablished in the
system. and future bond sales at the lowest
competitive rate would be assured.
F armel'rowned stock in the system. which
is jeopardized today. would be preserved.

“The system cannot be allowed to sink,
but it should not be saved either at the ex~
pense oi the nation's struggling iarmer- or
at the expense ol the taxpayer." Leach
concluded. "For the taxpayer to bailout
the bondholder is bad economics and bad
p rirrciple Our concern must be to save our
agricultural way or lite and at the same
time abide by the free enterprise ethic
upon which our society is based."
