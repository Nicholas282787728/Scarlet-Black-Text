“1 can't imagine a world with zero
regulation except aiter a war or in the
ideal world described by Rousseau,” said
Dr. Betty Bock on Monday in her talk
“Mysteries oi Regulation and Deregula-
tion."

Bock was the second ‘lecturer this
semester as part oi the Donald L. Wilson
Lectureship, established in honor oi alumv
nus Donald L wilson. in order to bring
speakers to Grinnell to discuss topics
related to American business.

Bock has studied government antitrust
regulation issues ior the better part oi the
past iour years. although she says she's
“not an economist ..I got my degree in the
thirties, and things have changed much
since then," .

A problem with regulation and a topic oi
great interest to Ms, Bock is “how regula-
tion and deregulation chase each other in a
variety oi ways." The paradox that Bock
discussed was how “each regulation leads
to a need ior more regulation.,.until aftera
while you realize that you're not ace
complishing your goal." To illustrate her
statement, Bock described the history oi
banking regulations. The, goal originally
was to make banks saier lor depositors by

“preventing banks irom doing stupid
things,” said Bock An example was bank
insurance, providing a backup should a
bank have trouble paying its investors.

The problem that resulted was “banks
ielt saicr to take risks they may not have
otherwise taken." according to Bock.
Eventually. the increased risktaking
created a need ior iurther regulations to
limit the types of investments banks could
pursue. ; .

In order to Continue attracting
customers, banks competed by offering
h ighcr rates or interest on investments, uii»
til it became necessary to regulate the
rates paid out to customers “Now .the on-
ly way lor banks to compete is by being
m ore friendly and courteous.” said Bock.

The problem with bank regulation made
it necessary to dcregulate and “begin to let
banks invest more broadly." according to
Rock. and “as this goes on .small banks
will come under increased pressure...or be
a cquired by bigger banks."

Bock expanded her discussion of the pros
blems or regulation and deregulation by
describing some problems with price
regulation after World War II. At the
beginlnng oi the war. some basic goods
a nd services were drawn off for the war efs

iort. ”Classically it you don't do
something labout the decreasing supplyl.
people with the most money will buy up the
goods." said Bock, and ”the price system
can‘t take care oi it " The step that seem-
ed easiest was to hold prices in place, ac-
cording to Bock. .

However, inequalities quickly developed
and Bock described several situations
w hcre uniair prices were set The governs
in out at the start oi the war “said, ior ex-
ample, on June 5 you can't raise prices
above the June 1 price lset ior a particular
goodi.” stated Bock But certain
businesses were caught in seasonal slumps
or offrsale periods. thus they were selling
goods at discounted prices. To hold the
businesses to the low prices could have
driven them out oi business.

Thc example used by hock was oi the
A nheuser-Buscli company. At the time the
regulation went into eiiect. the beer com-
pany had a large surplus oi malt that it
was selling al a cut rate on the market, If
the company has been held to the low price
it would have undercut the smaller
business, according to Bock

So to rectiiy the situation. the govern-
ment developed a large set of highly
specilic regulation policies ior each in
dustry. The laws became so speciiic that it
was very difficult to work with them and
the government went back to more general
rules, said Bock in her discussxon, The
rcason for all the regulation was. accor
ding to Bock. “an attempt to keep prices
irom rising as last as they would havc
otherwise and allocate products better."

At the end of World War II the price
regulation policies were ended and “infla-
tion didn’t rise as much as expected,” said
Bock “If regulation continued, it would
have chased the inequalities.” she said.
"The free market balanced out ines
qualities.” However. the success of the
lrec market is based on the assumption oi
"consistency in law and human behaVior."
slated Bock

A more current deregulation issue
discussed by Bock was the AT&T case
"We have always believed the telephone
industry was a natural monopoly and in
the 1930's and 1940‘s technology. it pl'OV
bably was." Bock said. The monopoly was
regulated so that they would not "favor
high density traffic areas over low density
areas. In a sense. the high density areas
were subsidizmg the low density areas,“
said Bock.

“In the 1950‘s and 1960's vie lelt in big
business one part shouldn't subsidize
a nothcr part,..and prevent outsiders irom
entering the market," slated Back. in the
c 'c oi AT&T. all their phones were puiu
chased irom onc supplier then leased out
To the customers Now that AT&T has been
broken down. there are a number of altera
natives and “it looks like rates are lower in

the alternate companies." said Bock.

Some of the problems assoctated with
the new telephone services are long. this
ficult to memorize access numbers and
trouble receiving credit for calls with fauls
ty connections or interruptions. Another
problem cited by Bock is the access charge
wanted by the former ATétT subsidiary
companies. “For big businesses, with lots
of calls. this is not a big deal, but for the
poor.. the cost oi the charge is greater
[because they make fewer callsl." Bock
said

The deregulation oi the airlines has
resulted in a situation the opposite oi the
AT&T break up, For businesspeople who
need to get somewhere quickly, the cost is
greater than it was iormerly, but ”for
those who can afford to Wait. the cost has
gone down.” according lo Bock, There are
several reasons [or this turn of events.

First. airline companies are oiiering
substantial reductions on flights if the
customers reserve and purchase tickets
early Secondly. with deregulation. it is
less expensive for airlines to route flights
through several cities rather than fly
direct nonstop ilights. In addition, the
number oi people entering the airline
busmess have increased because “it's
easier to do, you can lease planes and if it
doesn't work you just give back the
plancs," said Bock, The growing number
o f airlines has resulted lll Crowded airports
and a lack of landing slots, therefore slots
have been regulated.

The cost of health care is a new issue the
economic community is studying An at
tempt to reduce the rising costs has led to
insurance programs where doctors are
paid only by the insurance companies, not
the patients. To implement the programs
categories ior typcs oi treatment must be
created Bock cited a case of Blue Cross-
Blue Shield of Massachusetts as an exam-
ple of problems that can arise irom the in-
surance programs.

In Massachusetts, the doclors brought
suit against the insurance company charg
mg the categorizing of health care
prevents doctors irom treating patients
With in between problems or non-
cetcgorized illnesses because they might
not be paid lor the care they provide. The
doctors also argued extra care would not
be compensated and there is not motivar
(ion for innovative procedures. In the first
ca the doctors lost, but in the second
case. lhe court held that there was no con-
Spli‘aC therefore the doctors could choose
to go i to the plan or not However. “it is
unclear it those who stay out will get many
patients.” Bock said,

Dr Bock concluded hcr discussion by
omphasizing the dilcmnr oi deregulation
and regulation, "The s nothing easy
about regulation. .landl you never get
evenlliing you intended to get ,.you're
olnuys moving back and iorth "

“Dream Interpretation. A Christian
Perspective" was the subject of Jo
Calhoun's iniormal presentation this past
Sunday evening. A graduate oi Union
Theological Seminary in New York City.
Calhoun studied theology and psychology
and became interested in dream intern
prctration irom these perspectives during
hcl tudies.

"Everyone has dreams." she suggested,
‘ ' but not every dream is a blockbuster, and
not everyone remembers their dreams."
Calhoun mentioned that a great deal of
scientific research has been done in in-
vestigating dreams and the human REM
(Rapid Eye Movement) cycles during
5 leep. Some studies would seem to indicate
that dreams are an essential part oi our'
psychological make-up in that those
deprived oi dreams. by interrupting their
dream cycles, showed signs oi increased
irritability and even mental breakdown
There are. however. many theories as to
why we dream and what dreams are

According to several theories, Calhoun
explained, dreams are represenatative oi

your subconscious and thus allow you.
through interpretation, to see yourseli and
your problems on a subconscious level. as
well as a conscious level. This, Calhoun.
pointed out. can sometimes be very helpiul
and informative. Another theory is that
dreams are a form of spiritual link and
that through dreams and dream inter-
pretation one can enjoy a greater spiritual
experience with God. Herc. Calhoun noted
that the Bible contains a great many
references to dreams and dream ex-
periences in both the Old and New Testas
merit.

in order to best remember and interpret
your dreams. Calhoun suggested thatiirst,
one must be interested enough to try and
remember them and write them down im-
mediately aiter waking up, it is usually
helpiul to keep a pen and paper handy.
perhaps a spiral notebook by your bed. for
this purpose. She indicated a particular set
of divided areas of this “dream journal"
could be used to write down the dream
itself and others for marking down
associations. themes or anything else

, which might help you to relate the dream

to yourself.
