III'SI convocation

President of Gri iil College George
Drake opened the 1985-36 convocation
series yesterday with a talk entitled “Why
Bother?” In an interview on Wednesday.
Drake explained his somewhat unusual
topic.

Grinneli students go through a “pretty
rigorous process" to become educated.
Drake explained. most having attended
educational institutions for 12 to 15 years.
It is the motivation behind this constant
drive (or education which is the subject of
Drake’s questioning title, “Why bother"
going through all this trouble? Are
students just being pushed by the inertia ol
the educational system? These were the
questions asked by Drake. who stressed
that “intelligence is absolutely critical” ll
modern society is to progress.

Drake outlined some of the history and
importance or education. mentioning
notables such as Descartes. Galileo. and
Bacon, He pointed out that the American
continent would not have been discovered
it the dissolution of the knowledge of
navigation had not been practiced.

After this world View of the importance
of education. Drake concentrated on Grin-
nell’s place in this history, He listed how
Grinnell figures in the history of
knowledge dissolution. noting that the first
B.A. west of the Mississippi was issued
here in 1854. Grinnell was the first college
west of the Mississippi to admit women in

1867, and the first college to admit nlacks
aiter. the civil war.

After mentioning some at the great con-
tributions of Grinnell alumni such as
Harry Hopkins. Jesse Macy. George Her»
ran, and Edward Steiner, Drake specified
some areas oi education which were in
need of special attention from those who
have taken so much from the educational
system. He spoke at an “obligation to
education” which could be Satisfied by till-
ing the “general lack of talented leader
ship" in government. or by contributing
”clear thought" to Such important areas
as international relations or economic.

We are “far trom developing our lull
(educational) potential” Drake stated,
and this development is “important to the
future. and indeed the salvation. of our
soviety.”

Drake also discussed on Wednesday the
importance or the convocation program.
The convocations “bring our college
together." he said. This is a chance [or
students. laculty. and other community
members to hear leading experts,..discuss
some things you won’t get in class,"

Drake feels that all students might want
to go to a numoer oi convocations. so that
they will experience topics outside oi their
own interests.

"To make an efficient machine run a lit
tle better" is one of the reasons Resident
Hall Assistants lRHA'sl were created at
Grinnell this year. said John Foster, RHA
at Cleveland Hal].

According to Tom Crady, Associate
Dean of Student Aliairs. the RHA system
was started to provide “better programm-
ing in the halls." The RHA’S will be
responsible lor programming in tour
areas: social. cultural. recreational, and
educational. he said.

This sort of programmmg used to be the
job ot the hall presidents. explained Crady.
However, the hall president also had to
serve on the Joint Board, and according to
Denise Collins. Resident Advisor of Main
and Cleveland Halls. RHA'S were adopted
in order to “provide a better separation
between the two previous jobs or the hall
preSident.”

Crady added that some hall presidents
were more interested in only one aspect at
their job. and would not put all the needed
elfort into the other.

“Some hall councils worked well. but
some didn’t," he said. Each hall now elecB
a representative to the Joint Board Who

will take over that aspect oi the hall presi-
dent's job. said Collins

According to Foster. it is the Job at the
RHA to enhance those areas in which pro-
gramming may be lacking. and. as the
RHA of Loose Hall. Sandy Raimondo said.
“coordinate. organize and carry out all
hall activities."

RHA's must also chair two committees.
the Hall Activities Committee and the Hall
Council. explained Crady. The Hall Coun
cil conststs oi the REA and the SA's, and
the Activities Committee consists of one
elected member from each floor, he add~
ed.

Not all halls have RHA's. Main. Gates,
Dibble. Cowles and Younker are without
them. said Crady.

This was due to the lack of qualiﬁed ap-
plicants. althougnthey hope to till all the
positions by the end oi the year, he explain-
ed. Collins said this is a “trial year” for the
REA program. and they hope more
qualified students will become interested.

According to Crady. the qualitications
(or becoming an RHA include being a
junior or a senior. remaining in good
academic standing. living on campus [or

but he too is excited about the new pro
gram.

He added. however, that like any new
program. problems may arise and he
urges students to talk to him or their RA
about them.

changes. We don't want to otter something ‘
that's not going to work." he said.
