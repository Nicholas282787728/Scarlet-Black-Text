1300 years

by Susan Carlson

In honor ol the 300th anniversary bl
' S Bach’ 5 birthday. the Grinnell Col-

lege Collegium Musicum will present a
special concert on Sunday, April 21, in
Herrick Chapel at 8 p. m The concert IS
‘the' opening event of a week- -long
celebration commemorating ..J S.
Bach: s birth.

; Collegium Musicum, under the direc-
tion ol Elizabeth Hays, is a group of
students and faculty who periorm using
period instruments and perlormance
conventions of the lBth century. The
group derives its name from the Col-
legium Musicum that Each led in Leip»
.zig. Like the Grinnell College group, the

Leipzig Collegium Musicum was com-
posed of university students in addition
to members 0i Bach‘s family.

V'Tbe works to be performed include
sacred and secular compositions. Both
student soloists and soloists from the
Music Department faculty will be
featured. Amanda Amend and Kenneth
Goldsmith will be guest violinists. Stu»
dent soloistsvinclude Wolfram Fuchs,
tenor; Leslie Andrews, obbligaoo oboe;
Jake Heringman, classical guitar and
recorder; Lynn Sadlek and Lisa
Piediscalzi, harpsichords. other in
strumentalists include Margo Crandall,
recorder and trombone; M. Elizabeth
:Powell, recorder: Beth Caldwell
Violoncello; Alice Warshaw violin and

, Joan Lewis. Violin. Elizabeth Hays will
be the accompanying harpsichordist.
The perrormance will be enhanced by
_ t_he use of period instruments. The
recorders and harpsichords are
reconstructions oi those used at the
time of Bach. In addition, string
players will be using baroque bows and
gut strings. A lower pitch than modern
audiences are accustomed to is another
c'onvention of the baroque era that will
housed by Cullegium Musicurn. All of

these elements combine to produce a
dillerent sound quality than modern in-
struments. Listeners will notice the
mellower quality of sound, which does
not have as much brilliance as modern
instrumentation, but more texture.

‘ The Intricate structure of the works
along with the technical aspects, de
mand able performers. according to
Prof. Hays. Bach Wrote for accomplish-
ed perlormers. This is especially evi-
dent in the Concerto in d-mlnor for two

solo violins, the Concerto in c-minor for
two solo harpsichords and the Branden-
burg Concerto No. IV. in Cir-major. Hays
has placed an emphasis on the articulae
tion of each melodic motif in order to
set off the competitive play between
soloists and to bring out the strong
rhythmic element.

The Brandenburg Concerto No. lv.
will be the climax of the program. This
concerto has always been a favorite
among Bach fans. it was composed
when Each was court composer at the
court of Anhalt-Cothen (171771723). Ken
Goldsmith, featured violin soloist will
be performing on a reconstruction of a
period instrument. Listeners will notice
the elaborate ornamentation, most of
which was written in by Bach.

The Celebration of Bach’s birthday
continues later in the week. On Wednes-
day, April 24, The Chronicle of Anna
Magdalena Each will be shown in Fine
Arts room ind. The tribute will conclude
next Sunday, April 23, with a concert by
the Twentieth»Century Ensemble,
under the direction of Jon Chenette.

“Bacchanalia” will be a concert of
20th century pieces inspired by Bach.
