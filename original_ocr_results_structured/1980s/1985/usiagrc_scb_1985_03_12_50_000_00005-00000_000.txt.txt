ior criticising Mr Macmeady's
character ivtith this in mind. it is gall-
ing to speculate that the same person
\\l10 criticized Mr Macc eady toi-
"padding" his essay with a "do-
iiothing" position has no doubt listed
ior will listl his/her own Council posi-
tion on his/her Job resume)

Allow me to turiher point out that the
L'ouncil is somewhat involved with SUA
to the extent that membership on it
‘inay be considered a credit to one‘s
relationship to student government.
ltlr, Maccready. the "Concerned

Member". and the rest oi the Council
were personally selected by President
Golden and confirmed by Joint Board,
indeed. Judicial Council is a standing
committee oi SGA and is listed as such
In the SGA Constitution.

I am also deeply concerned by the let
ter's “anonymity". The “Concerned
Members’ letter accused Mr. Mac-
Cl'eady, in short. of trying to defraud
the campus into believing that his Coun-
cil involvement was a cred‘t to his can-
didacy. Fair is lair: The Concerned
Member” had a duty to bring to the at
tention oi the campus something he/she
lelt was important [or it to Consider.
But by choosing to remain

"anonymous" the ”Concerned
Member"showed that he/she obviously
believes him/herself to be above the re
quirements which Judicial Council sets
[or the students who come before it. 1
refer to the Judicial Council require-
ment that all accusations be accom-
panied by a name lest they be ime
mediately regarded as specious and
stemming irom questionable motives,

on a last note. Council proceedings
are known as “hearings". not ”trials".
the reason being that they are iirst and
foremost meetings tor the exploration
and reconciliation of student
disagreements, and only assign “vere
dicts" and “sentences" when recon-
ciliation is impossible. 7 tan McLean

So, is a union really necessary?

About a month ago, I iound out that
e College lull-time lood service
orkers had received approval irom
e National Labor Relations Board
NLRBl to vote this Wednesday, March
3 on uhelher they should join
< emasters union Local 90. At that time.
-ood Service Director Dave McConnell
Quad not posted notice or the voting date.
although he had known oi the NLRB ape
proval since January 30th. McConnell
linally posted the voting date. claiming
that he had not done so beiore because
31inch 13 was a “tentative" voting
ate.
r A live page letter sent to all workers
by McConnell plays upon these iears.
Alter painting an ominous picture oi the
plight oi the workers should they not get
a contract with the college, McConnell
labels the inlormatioii sent by worker-
organizers to other workers as “lies"
and “innuendo." ’l‘hen. alter stating
that Food Service wages should not be
compared to last; wages, McConnell
does just that. asserting that the rate at
wage increase since 1976 ior 5843 was
7,24 percent compared to 8.53 percent
tor the Food Service Workers. Although
most maids and B&G personnel make
almost twice as much as enme Food
Service employees. this letter was
qnough to lead some workers into thinks
ing that they were better situated tiian
those poor unionized B816 workers,
Enclosed with this letter was a Coma
parison oi Grinnell College Food Ser-
’ice workers pay and beneiits wrth
eight other lood service institutions.
it'wo at these institutions are not col-
leges. and probably nnne oi these other
i‘nstitutions have food services oi the
award-winning caliber that Grinnell's
is tor was). But most importantly. the
mstiiuiions used as a basis ior come

parison were numbers. not names.

Over the past several weeks. I have
been both impressed and a bit mystiiied
by McConnell‘s commitment to keep
it orkers irom going union. i-le submits
a budget to the administration every
year. so on the surface of the thing, he
has nothing to lose from the workers go-
ing union. Apparently he or somebody
does. however. Two weeks ago. Presln
dent Drake told SGA President Matt
Golden that student food service
workers could lose their jobs ii the full-
time food service workers went union.
It was rumored that students had lost
Jobs with B&G when 5&6 struck in
1974. The assertion is highly doubtful.
The rumor is wrong. I acknowledge the
importance at student jobs on campus.
However. aiter speaking with brake
and Golden, l was astonished that

turned student opinion against the
workers who support unionization el-
torts.

As {or those workers who have "been
terminated” over the past few years,
McConnell said in his letter to the
workers: “Poor periormance is not
protected by a union contract." Poor
performance or not. the “grievance
procedure" at the workers' disposal is
an empty shell. Workers with coins
plaints about McConnell‘s decisions can
go talk to administrators who. as is only

natural. believe in and support their
subordinate. The administration has
never solicited direct employee teed-
back 7 that is feedback not filtered
through McConnell.

McConnell claims that Warren Fogel.
who was fired in December was given
several warnings beiore he was let go.
Warren claims ihat he wasn't warned.
Bill Gerard, a "legally blind" janitor
who was ﬁred back in 1983 came back
from his summer vacation for his fall
evaluation to find that he no longer had
a job. He was never warned

According to workers and ex-
workers. the workers who either lett or
were “terminated" were the College's
best workers. All of the former workers
whom I have spoken with have found
other Jobs except for Gerard i think
that the departure of a high number of
workers over such a short period oi
time when the Job market is so tight is
suspect, Furthermore. their departure
is a student issue — were losing the
best workers.

Fogel has taken his case to the Iowa
Civil Rights Commission. He doesn't
have much to lose because at 62. it
would be hard for him to find a job
elsewhere. Fogel would have become
eligible for retirement benefits had he
worked until he was 65 This is notthe ’
lirst time workers have been let go Just
belore they became eligible ior
benefits.

One might ask why most workers _
have not sought arbitration alter being
dismissed. First of all, most at these
workers have only a vague idea oi what
their rights are under the law. Second,
one might also ask why a worker would
fight a case in a town where unemploys
ment is high. and their former boss is
the mayor : -
