lSuperpowers ’slnc ’ in Cold War

by Karla Erickson
Students or today have a heavy
burden. and are not yet ready to lace
that burden. said Robert Pickus. Presi-
. dent of the World Without War Council.
He made the comment at last Thurs-
‘day's Rosenlield event. “Pursuing
Peace and Security: What Americans
'Need to Know about the US. *
'U.S SR. Relations and the Arms
Race."
. Aiter 27 years In peace work. Plckus
asserted that one problem with
nstudents is that some have decided they
know all of the answers, Because of
‘this. the attitude exisLs that. “ .if you
are morally certain you know the way
out then you don t need to listen. ” he
,explained
Joseph Wall. Director of the Rosen-
sfield Public Affairs Program. said the
program was largely planned by
‘Pickus who “had the idea for a
dialogue on several campuses. The first
'campuses chosen were Grinnell and
,Stanford. " When President Drake in
troduced the night's lormat. he seemed
a to ioreshadow the lack of focus to Come
when he was indecisive whether to call
‘ it a debate, dialogue. or discussion.
Joining Pickus. who served as
‘ moderator/clarifier {or the event. were
‘Richard Barnet. author of several
books and co-lounder of the Institute for
. Policy Studies in Washington D.C.. and
Henry Rowen. Senior Research Fellow

'Cedar Rapids. 1a.. came to the Des
. Moines office and listened to the
Students' comments on Grassley’s vote
sand opinions on the Nicaraguan situa-
tion, Though the students had remained
'two hours beyond closing time. the
building security only threw out the
'medla. Meanwhile. the students inSlde
, prepared a teletype message for
Senator Grassley which informed him
ithat they still hoped for a public
meeting even in the light or the pro-
‘posal's failure. They also sent a
,message to Democratic Senator Tom
Harkin. thanking him for his Vote
«against the measure.

Most oi the 40 people involved in the
'protest had signed a pledge to perform
acts of civil disobedience in the case
that the war in Nicaragua is escalated

. in any manner by the United States. Ac-
cording to Grinnell Spokesman Robert
'Curley. including the pledges signed at
the University of Iowa and Iowa State

Iowa has one of the higest per capita
inumber ol pledges' in the country.

Alter his short speech. the “debate"
began, Dialogue is probably the more
appropriate word, as a general feeling
evolved that there was not enough
locus. The strong differences in opinion
or Barnet and Rowen never fully sur~
faced. as Pickus later painted out.
Basically. it seemed a dialogue bet-
ween Pickus and one or the other of the
men. The actual debaters (Barnet and
Rowen) had few conversations.

Barnet ielt that the world today faces
a crisis of understanding. He promoted
that the U.S. is trying to understand
what has happened with the military
power and. in his opinion. much of it is
based on inappropriate psychological
theories. Now. he assessed. ”The basic
problem is what comes about in spite of
the fact that no major power wants it
tnuclear wart,"

Alter spending two-and-one-hall
years with the CIA. Rowen concluded
that lack oi understanding is a real pro~
blem. The U.S. is now in a position of re-
maining involved and protecting
others. he explained. In addition, he tell
that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. really
have nothing to fight about. but are
presently “stuck” in this light. He
remarked. “I have yet to see an alter-
native concept that looks sater."

“Complacency is as dangerous as
fear." said Barnet in response to a
question about people's attitudes, He
lelt that assumptions the US. made for-
ty years ago when it was the only world
power are not necessarily relevant
now. He said that he {eels that some
peace groups today are overly tolerant
of Soviet policies

Unilateral disarmament is not the
answer. said Rowen who remarked that
he did not want to leave the impressmn
that nothing could be done. But. he
pointed out that Congressional
members are presently ignoring the
peace movements at least in the out
come of the votes.

Pickus. one of his comments. defendv
ed his View that the United States has in
the past iollowed the Soviet agendas
and done almost nothing to try to
change it. He strongly opposed
unilateral disarmament While not pro-
moting President Reagan’s use of the
term. he supports the {act that the
U.S.S.R. is an evil empire. which can be
seen through their treatment or Alghan
children. He sees the answer in figuring
out a way to change the Soviet agenda.

Rowen then said there would pro-
bably be a renewal of isolationism in
the U.S. lsolationism would bring the

troops back to stay. and out of loreign
affairs. He elected national security as
most important. but seemed opposed to
isolationlsm through his later
statements about the European point at
view since Europeans cannot close
themselves on as the U5 supposedly
can.

The Soviet challenge to the II S, is
almost entirely a military one. accorr
ding to Barnet, He iurther explained
that the potential for U S involvement
with the U.S.S.R is through a third
world country.

Barnet asserted. “The issue is the
behavior of super-powers.” He felt that
there could be a baSIS of serious com»
mitment to arms reduction. but for this
to come about, certain sacrifices had to
be made with more restraint than in the
past.

Later, Barnet added that perhaps the
term “evil” is justifiable for the
U S.S.R. But. he implored. the real
question is what to do to manage the
relationship. He warned that a build-up
in nuclear power or “evil" rhetoric is
not the way to make the U.S.SR. easier
to deal with. reasoning that there is “no
room for mistakes."

In a briei postrdlalogue interview, the
two were asked what they thought the
greatest misconception is that
Americans hold about Russian intenr
tions. Rowen said mirror images. the
tendency on Americans' part to project
their own tendencies and values on
Soviet intentions. is a common
misconception.

Barnet. on the other hand. defined the
greatest misconception as a lailurc to
look at the history of the Soviet Union
and theretore America Judges the el-
iects ol the arms race on Soviet society
by criteria that do not flt the society.
The U.S. has been iortunate enough.
Barnet said. to be a societv wlth peace
Unfortunately. the U. .S.R. has a
history which lacks peace. but
Americans fail to understand.

All of the other planets in our
solar system could be placed
inside the planet Jupiter.
