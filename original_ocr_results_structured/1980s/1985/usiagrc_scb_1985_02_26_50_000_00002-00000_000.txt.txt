i believe the students oi Grinnell College
are discerning in many repsects.
Thereiore. it wouldn't be iair to you, nor
accurate. to portray myseli as someone
who can save the day ior SGA

i am someone concerned about college
liie. academics. and other areas oi student
interests. Grinnell College exists because
oi our presense here. so we deiinitely have
the right to take more assertive steps
toward increasing our iniluence.

The potential ior SGA to be a strong and
positive iniluence within the campus com»
munity already exists. All that remains is

to channel this potential into concrete
results. To do so effectively. the president
must maniiest the iollowing qualitites:
Listen to all sides because. in com»
munication, listening is 50% of the whole.
-Lead by providing guidance and sup»
port to people with concerns or ideals.
-Be objective because there are at least
two sides to every issue. Nothing is cut and
dry. nor is anything below initial cons
sideratlon.
aBe dedicated to representing the
students even when it would require as
stand on an issue that would be in contrast

to the president‘s personal Views

-Be iair because the President s rcspo
sibility is to mitigate between polar vie
points and take pains to pcriorm his/h
duties with the best interest 01 the studen
at the iorelront.

i can’t promiste instant success. b'ut
can guarantee that i will persevere in
the best oi my ability and ascribe to ti
aforementioned qualities tn order to star
the student body as a competent and co
cerned president

l have spent two and a hali years involv~
ed in student Government at Grim-tell and
ieel that l have an undersmnding oi the
student needs which SGA should address.
SGA has the potential to be an iniluencial
force in the decision making processes at
Grim-tell and i teel hat 1 know how to make
sen work ior the student's beneiit.

As Student Coordinator 1 haverun many
events tor the campus community in-
cluding blood drives, Waltzes. and the Stu-

Committee which has helped to develop

SGA is a student service DrganiLation
that deals with campus issues and acts as
a pal cal forum. I feel I have the
qualiiications and experience to lead SGA.
I have been Younker Hall President. a
member of Joint Board. and a member oi
the SGA Finance Committe {or three
semesters each. In the past three years my
connection with SGA has been severed 0n-
ly Once. last semester, while I was study-
ing in London.

As President. 1 would direct SGA’s at-

the college as well as the appointment or
various positions on Grinnell' student
media. i am also on the New stufiEntpays
Committee and the Relays Committee.

The reason that l have been so involved
at Grinnell is that i really enjoy doing
whatever i can to make Grinnell more
than an academic institution. There are so
many things other than academics that
are an essential part oi a college ex»
perience.

i think that Grinnell should increase the
amount oi contact that it has with other
Associated Colleges oi the Midwest
because that would not only increase our

tention toward campus issues. ior next
year promises to bring several important
changes thatwill aiiectcampusliie. These
changes include cutting he student loan
programs. and changing the drinking age.
1 would also like to see SGA address such
questions as the graded tutorial. the reper-

cussions ol over—enrollment, and the 896'

tuition hike even though the endowment
grew by $8,000.01». At the same time. Grin-
nell‘s politically inquisitive student body
necessitates SGA's continuing involve-
