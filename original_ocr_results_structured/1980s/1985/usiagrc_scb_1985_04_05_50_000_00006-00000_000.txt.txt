2nd All-Campus Vote

Today, you can vote on the second all
campus reterendum this semester,

One item on the ballot is a proposal to
restructure the Student Government
Association. This proposal, sponsored
by Student Affairs. calls {or the election
or .ioint Board representatives atrlarge
rather than trorn the dorms. It also
calls tor the creation or the Resident
Assistant who would replace the hall
coordinator. The Resident Assistant
would also take up the slack in responr
sibiiities created by the abolition oi the
hall presidents.

Another item which was to be on the
ballot was Withdrawn by its sponsor.
cindy Oshler. This item concerned
Black recruitment at the college.
Ushler is rewriting the proposal along
with a special task iorce cuordinated by
the oltice oi Minority Affairs.

The Following proposal is sponsored by
Mauhewﬁoldem V

. The students or Grinnell College em-
phatically disapprove oi the Reagan ad-
ministration's repeated reductions in
student tinanciai aid. since the ad-
ministration took oitice in total, total
tederal aid to college students has
declined 13.9% in real terms (Chronicle
ot Higher Education 1/23/35). We
believe this trend constitutes a short
sighted governmental policy that must
be reversed immediately.

The administration's current student

aid reduction proposal threatens to cut
short the education at over one million
American college students. in lowa,
this proposal would result in a 20%
reduction in the number oi students
receiving federal financial aid (Des
Moines Register. 1/22/35). Further
reductions in federal assistance to
students would render a college educa
tion inaccessible to most middlesclass
Americans.

The administration‘s proposal
threatens the quality oi both our

nation's and the world's [uture Whlle .

we recognize that the tederal defictt
poses a signil’icant problem, we do not
believe that decreasing federal aid to
college students is the appropriate
means oi reducmg that deficit. In a
world plagued by countless ditiicult
problems. the way to prepare our socie-
ty tor the tasks at the future is not by
reducing the availability Di education,
We demand our nation's leaders make
education a priority on the national
agenda.

The path to building 2| better world
society rests on the foundation of an
educated populace Hence, we along
with students throughout the country
implore our representatives in the
l'ederal government to vote against the
Reagan administration‘s proposed
reductions in federal BSSistance to col,
lege students.
