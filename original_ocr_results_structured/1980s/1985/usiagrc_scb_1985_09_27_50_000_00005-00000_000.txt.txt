An inside look at the Soviet Union

This is the first of a three
part series concerning the

travels of Abe Yoshihisa, a
former Grinnell College
exchange student.

It was one or the most important pur»
poses of my travel in Europe this summer
to see some oi tile reality oi EastrWest at:
iairs in Europe. To do that. it was
necessary iirst to visit the Headquarters oi
the Eastern World. the USSR.

This time I assigned two weeks
i7/l~7/is> for travel to the USSR. 1 col
lected as much iniormation about travel to
the USSR as possible, and I iinaiiy decided
to Join a student-tour conducted by Scan
dinayia Student Travel Service, This tour
is. unlike lntourist tours. so unique that it
includes two meetings with the Soviet
youth and a visit to a medical institute.

i was expecting some European par
ticipants, but this tour consisted oi thirty
Americans. three Canadians, and one
Japanese, A Danish tour leader and a Rus-
sian tour guide took care of us tor the two

weeks, during which we visited Leningrad.
Kiev, Odessa. and Moscow. We were supe
posed to tiy from Copenhagen to Len»
ingrad and from Moscow back to
Copenhagen. but I entered Leningrad by
train from Helsinki and left Moscow (or
w arsaw by train again at my convenience,

One of the impressions which I had
throughout this tour is the low standard of,
living ill the USSR. which differs from the
image we associate with such a super
power.

I visited the largest department stores in
Leningrad and Moscow, and was surprised
at the small amount oI goods. low quality.
and narrow selection there. Shoppers lined
up in some places to purchase these goods.
Clerks used big wood abacuses and hard
brown paper ior wrapping. There was no
advertisement except ior guiding signs on
the wall, so i ielt emptyin a strange way.

When I visited the radio and television
section. 1 Ielt as it I had gone back twenty
years in a time machine, Radios were very
big in size and the reception of the TVS
was simply terrible To begin with, there
were very few available models from
which to choose, Needless to say, fashion
sense was non-eXistelit. Cameras with big
brown cases emed to still be in use. and

situations where we must take action. The
only persuasive or convincing arguments
are those proies -d by ourselves. we can-
not accept others' praise or criticism until,
cven subconsciously, we have committed
ourselves to the validity or their sugges-
tions. instead oi others emanating the
power to subvert and direct our tempers
merit. it is ourselves wiio maniiest and can
rcr ability to them. although we conscious-
ly believe diirci-etitly. we are pawns of
ourselves,

The epiphany nearly complete, i tinish-

were probably black and while i looked
around the toy and record sections. where
l was also shocked, By the way. I secretly
took some pictures in the department
stores,

Hotels were also terrible, Our tour was
not expensive. so we did not stay in lost-
class hotels, since only loreign tourists can
Stay in first-class hotels, the hotels in
which wc stayed would be the highest
ranked for Russian and Eastern European
tourists. Water was yellow and muddy.
and hot water did not come out often,
Toilet paper was hard and brown.

Meals were horrible as well. We ate stale
bread and cucumber salad, We could not
Chew the beef It could be considered as
the meat of an old cow who could not milk
any longer. or the meat of a bull who could
not work any longer. Talking of desserts.
we had nothing but cold stale rice cakes.
We never had fruits or sea foods during the
two weeks.

i saw many shops on the street which
were closed W|thout any reason. In the
USSR there are some toreign currency

Vice President Walter Mondale

shops where only western currency is ac»
ceptable. You can see various goods rang»
ing from blue Jeans to Walkmans. but Rus-
sians are not allowed to enter, l bought
Nescaic corree powder and some razor
blades at one of these foreign currency
shops for Vladimir who is a SERVAS host
about whom I shall discuss later, This
means that they cannot obtain these kinds
oi goods. There were no vending machines
except tor Juice drinks. This system was
strange. They do not have cans, so they use
glasses, There were three or tour glasses
on a machine and everyone uses the same
glasses Is this an extreme of coma
munism‘? Anyway. i rarely saw even
paper cups. 1 saw paper cups in a train,
though, and used them, After the second or
third use. the juice started to leak!

We had two occasions to take airplanes
during this tour, 1 was surprised at many
things here, as well, There was no com»
puter at the counter in the airport. They
seemed to exchange iniormation only by
telephones, Rain leaked [rum the ceiling

bus at the airport There was not a single
satellite, The runway was so rough that i

In the USSR the black market has
spread to a great extent in spite oi governs
mclit scrutiny. This probably means that
the Sovtet people are not satisfield with
their situation. Western tourists are asked
to sell blue jeans. tennis shoes. day packs,

[the Yosnlnlsa

dollar bills, and other things on the street
and even by waiters at hotels.‘Aftcr a per»

was disgusted with someone's words. “Do
you have a Walkman? Sell it," By the way.
I hear that there are many prostitutes who
hunt Western tourists

In addition to such a low standard of liv-

a tension which is peculiar to a
m itary nation is also one or my impres-
sions, On Sundays. young soldiers with
military clothes hang around the towns.
Signs 01 propaganda are seen in many
places. The unusual depth or the subways
makes us associate them with nuclear
shelters,

I was shocked when l visited the tomb of
unknown soldiers and the statue of Lenin
at the Lenin museum; some boys and girls
who seem to be about ten years old and
wearing military suits were guarding

, them They look so serious that they never

smile even if a tourist approaches them. I
had a cliiil ’n imagining the education they
have. Ru iait people need their passports
and permission even for domestic travel,
When they buy a train ticket, they show
their passports and their names are wril»
tcti down. Two or three conductors get on
each car of a train. have a list of
passengers. and watch tiiern.

i have written my impressions through
my eyes so far But yust walking around
alid seeing is not enough to know the reali-
ty 01 a naiioii. i had some opportunities to
meet some people and talk with them.

First 01 all, l have to write about the
SERVAS host. Vladimir SERVAS is a
worldwide host organization for travellers
which, at this moment. has two hosts in the
USSR. even though this kind oi organiza»
lions is illegal in the USSR. Vladimir heard
about SERVAS lrom a British traveller
and becamea member. He is a biologist, in
his late thirties with a wife and two
daughters, He showed us around Len-
ingrad {or two days, and invited three
other American participants and me to
dinner at his house

There are no individually-built houses in
the USSR. His house was on the third floor
oi a big building interior decoration was,
01 course. western type. but he did not
have a tape recorder or a camera let alone
an audio set or a car. He works at the
HOUSE OF FRIENDSHIP. an organiza-
tion which hosts foreign travellers and
visitors. as a volunteer. It is ollicially
sanctioned by the Soviet government and

- conducts various activities. particularly

He is very intelligent and speaks English
tluently. He has never been abroad but
reads many English books, most oi them
published in the Western World and {mind

with the situation in the USSR but had a
very reserved point or view unlike an
underground man oi action.

For example. he said. "that KAI airliner
was highly likely to be a spy plane.” As for
the northern territory issue (tour small
islands iii the north oI Japan have not been
returned from the USSR to Japan yet since
World War II,t. “the USSR suffered so
much during World War II and so cannot
take the initiative." Finally as for
freedom. Vladimir said. “it is unavoidable
[or government to have control to some ex-
tent in order to have Society stable."

Supplementing the northern territory
issue. [asked him. “The USSR has already
established a military base over there,
hasn't she?” He answered. “It is true that
there is a base. but it is temporary, and the
USSR is ready to withdraw and rcturnlit to
Japan it the right time comes."

He asked us to bring some records and
books if we or our friends had a chance to
visit Leningrad again and gave us a list.
They Cannot. of course. be obtained in the
USSR, Since he was 'doing such illegal
things, I thought at Iirst he might be in the
KGB or a member of the Communist Parr
ty. but it turned out to be false. I worried
about him and asked him what he would do
if the KGB found out about him. He
answered calmly. ”it has never happened
beiore and it it happens. I can make any
excuse because I am a member of the
HOUSE OF FRIENDSHIP."

Nevertheless, I shall never forget his
wife's face tearing something. He used to
be a tour guide, so we truly enjoyed his ex-
cellent tour. He took us to a Japanese
gar-den in Leningrad botanical garden and
an electric appliances shop where SONY
V'I‘R's were sold, It cost five million yen
iabout twenty thousand dollars) at the Dfr
llcial rate ,

He knows a lot or English jokes and let us
enjoy them. [don't know if this is a joke or
not. but he told me that Russian people
think that every Japanese tourist is carry-
ing a Geiger Counter. rearing radioactivi-
ty. Anyway, i was iorced to think about
various things while talking with him, The
other day. Igota letter from him He sent
me some articles about Japan which were
in the English paper in the USSR.
