One:I again SGA has found a way
to blow its own horn. The
absurdity of last week's meeting
(December 11) confirmed my earlier
suspicions that SGA is not a
representative of the student body
but instead is a self—centered
clique usinn Joint Board to push
their views on the campus.

The topic which dominated the
reeting was the Scarlet and Black's
deciSion to not print an issue on
the last Friday of classes. This
decision was made by the spring
semester staff (which traditionally
does the last issue of the fall
semester) with the approval of the
fall semester staff

The reasons for this decision
