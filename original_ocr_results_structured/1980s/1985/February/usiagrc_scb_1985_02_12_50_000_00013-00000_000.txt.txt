and our linal aims were identical. Why.
then. was the impression oi intense con-
lllct and hostility allowed to dominate this
paper's Coverage oi events?

The answer lies in that this paper chose
not to locus on demonstrations ul Cone
trasting opinions both dedicated to ending
apartheid. but chose instead to portray an
imagined battle o1 soLidl groups. This
paper took one look at who we were. hou-
Vie were dressed. and what extra-
curricular activities we may tor may noti
have participated in and concluded ipso
lacto that we could be nothing else but igr
iiorant. lnhumani horn-blowing conser~
vative/Young Republicans who could not
sincerely be concerned with apartheid or
Grinnell's reaction to it. Hence the SSzB'S
labeling us "counterrprotestors" when in
tact we net/er described ourselves as such.
Hence he editorial judgement that we
were “conservatives protesting the

In conclusion. the SkB's coverage of last
Friday's events is best described by the
words 01 a famous publisher: "You supply
the pictures and I‘ll supply the war."
Rather than give inrdepth coverage to two
groups oi concerned students trying to
eliminate apartheid. this paper played up
the “counter-protest" angle it created to
the point where the real issues oi apartheid
and Grinnell‘s reaction to it took second
place. Thus a disservice was done to
ourselves. SEA twhose activities regar-
ding the Trustees visit went wholly

and publicly advocated nothing but lull
