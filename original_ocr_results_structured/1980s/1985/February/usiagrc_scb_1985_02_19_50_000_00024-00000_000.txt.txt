Gary Ripp in his little hole

Every once and awhile I hear someone
say that they have nothing much left to
learn. This is usually out oi ﬁle mouth at
some tender lad, green in years and callow
in youth, who doesn't really believe his
own words and thus may be excused from
them. Unfortunately, sometimes these ab—
surd words came not from whelps who
know no better. but instead issue forth
from ‘learned and Wise’ men, who find
pleasure in feeling the victims of some sort
or tantastically huge ocean oi events that
are both uncontrollable and pernicious.
Women as well as men seem to cave into
this angst ridden dilemma of nothingness.
and questions are answered by the more
and more convincing ideology oi disbeliei.
They convince themselves that there is
nothing left to ability. that all is forgotten,

I knew a man who belied ﬁle pessimistic
assertions of people such as these.
although 1 never actually met him. His
name was Gary Ripp. He lived in my town.
behind Hillside School in the woods of the
same name. Hillside woods, one last bit of
the quaint. ingenous landscape oi
Westchester county. a last unspoiled
garden in which our children could play.
And deep within. living apart irorn mostor
society. was Gary Ripp. slightly crazy
eyed from what I‘m told. but living and
thinking all the same.

He lived in a manhole. “A manhole?"
you ask. Yes. that’s right. Nestled in the
woods, at least a quarter mile irom any
real road, was a manhole cover, This is ac-
tually easily explainable: an old iarv
mhouse had stood nearby. but had burned

but it should be underswod in
Europe and North American that
foreign investment supports the pre-
sent economic system and thus in-
directly the present system of
political injustice. If Washington
wants to contribute to the develop
ment or a just society in S.A., it must
discourage investment in South
Africa. We blacks are perfectly will-
ing to surier the consequences. We
are quite accustomed to sutlering,

He adds:

We blacks reject the theory that
sanctions will harm us more [than
the government]. It’s always whites
who say that. If people want to be
our iriends then they must act as
friends, with deeds.

Divestment is obviously in the best in»

Africa. For further reading we suggest the

chimney and some stone squares in the

The manhole was close by. rusted but
still iunctional as a protective covering for
what was beneath it, which was two earv

I had come too late to make this
character‘s acquaintance. The rooms
were musty and small. Upon one wall was
a broken cross. and a very plastic looking
figurine was on the floor, This was Gary
Ripp’s abode. Dave told me that it had
once been much better looking. back when
he was very young and used to get high in
this dank hole with his friends and this
strange man.

Nearby there was Ripp’s rocks. The
story goes that Gary Ripp, who loved to
take LSD. had acquired through a com-
bination oi both working out and speed the

armile irom the old quarry-garbage dump
even deeper in the woods. The evidenee
was. if you’ll excuse the phrase. solid as a
rock. [or here. in the middle of the woods
was Ripp's rocks. about 90 rocks built into
a wall, a fort to keep friends cozy when
they wanted to sit and smoke and listen to
nature. Even in the woods, where nothing
really mattered. Gary Ripp had establish-
ed. at least for a brief time. a bit of a
legend '

They ended up taking Gary Ripp away in
a straight-jacket. One day someone decid-
ed ta psychologist l presumel that they
didn't like that Gary hipp hanging out in
the woods. so they came with their nets
and dragged him (ﬁguratively speaking,
of course) out at his little hole. The
chimney remained calm. and everybody
else could only wonder about it all, Ripp
disappeared. but his story didn't. it re.
mained, and was transposed right here to
paper.

Now, I know we can go into some in.
tellectual nonsense about how the burned
down farmhouse is symbolic of time. and
the hole represents man trying to get away
to simple laltn. etc. But the fact is. theirs
really is a manhole. there really is Ia
chimney. and Ripp. God bless him
wherever he is. really is named Ripp:
Which all goes to prove one thing: If there
is one thing to be believed it is that life
teaches us lessons, and the lesson lite
taught me here was that people who don't
live in holes have a decided advantage
over those oi us who do.
