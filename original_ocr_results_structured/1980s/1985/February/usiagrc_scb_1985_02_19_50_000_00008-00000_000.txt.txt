Three Stories From Home

by itobert Qiiashie

Born in the Eastern Region of Ghana.
Rextord Daniel Osai. has had very mixed
ieelings about the tour years he has spent
at Grinnelt. On one hand there is the
realization that as the oldest of [our sons,
he is looked for to be the leader in his iami»
1y. something which’is almost impossible
to do irom halfway around the globe. The
sense of separation was intens' 'ed tor
Rexiord by the loss of his father during the
military coup staged in 1982 by Jerry
Rawlins. the current leader of the
Ghanaian state.

“I wanted to go home, to go see my mom

. to see how she’s doing, but she doesn't
want me to come because at the situation.
Military rule is kind of different,” Rextord
explained. .

For the most part, Rexi'ord has had to re
1y on letters from friends and family to tell
him of the situation at home. But. Rextord
says, a person can only learn so much
much letters. He wants to go home to see
[or himselt.

On the other hand. Rexlord realizes that
[or him, more education means more in
come. which in turn. would mean Rexford
could lead his iamily all the better. And, in
some senses. the best opportunity for an
education was offered to him by schools in
the United States.

Rexfard's choice of an American school
over one of Ghana was based [or the most
part on considerations oi time. The system
in Ghana. which mimics that of Great Bri»
tain. requires two years oi college aiter
high school before a student is allowed to
enter a university.

Rextord had already been out oi high
school and working [or some time before
he decided to return and secure a degree.
He didn’t look iorward to the prospect or
spending another six years in school
before receiving a marketable degree.

Before returning to school. Rexiord had
been working in one oi the most popular or
private industries in Accra. He drove a
taxicab In Accra cabs are everywhere
and commuters are everywhere too The
main streets are packed with cabs and the
curbs are packed with people: Arms
straight out. palms down. waiting to dash
for the first car to stop,

“Taxi drivers made a lot oi money but
they don‘t really spend it wisely," hexiord
explained. “Every day you can getmoney,
Every day you can just make a road trip
and get more money. it you own a hotel
maybe you’ll make a sale of about ten
dollars a day, but driving a cab you can
make maybe 40 dollars every day so
there 5 me iey all the time.

“A lot oi people want to learn how to
drive Even people who work in the
ministry or places like that will get their

own taxi to drive on their way home from Be has suiielui to d o lot it

the job."

The majority oi the drivers work ior
larger companies but in Rexiord's case.
driving was an individual enterprise. “My
father bought me a taxi and I made a lot oi
money. I didn't have to work irom a
garage because the taxi was tor me and
my iather. So. i didn't have to worry about
waking up early or getting the right
amount oi money ior him. What i had i
would Just give to him." Rextord said.

Two things began to happen about the
same time in Rextord's liie. As he began to
sense that taxi driving would be a dead-
end iob ior him. letters irom old high
school mates studying in the us. began to
pique his interest in traveling to this counr
try.

When he iirst brought the idea to his
parents. their reaction was all negative.

Like many irom Ghana. Rexi‘ord said.
they had gleaned their impressions oi the
United States from motion pictures and
television. Most oi the iilms released in
West Airica are the more action-packed

and violent depictions oi American big city
lite. ,

Rextord went ahead and took th
'American Scholastic Aptitude and when' he
received his scores he began to corms
pond in private with many American
schools including Grinnell

But. Rextord said it he had known what
liie in this town was like he would have
never chosen to come here. Adjusting to
the slower pace and small campus was
hard. he said, The biggest attraction .oi
Grinnell ioi him he commented was the
iiiiancial aid package they oiiered. not t.ie
scenery .

Overcoming language barriers and
American stereotypes oi Airicans were
other tasks which awaited Rextnrd when
he arrived in the country. »

Rexi'ord talked about the trouble he had
with iinding a liason irom the college at
the airport in Newark New Jersey

“When I came here I was in a suit and

Benin. a tiny Airican country on the
West Coast oi Airica. recently strengthen-
ed its ties with the United States, George
Moose, Gnnnell Class of '66. is enjoying ZI
protracted tourney as a result of the im»
proved relations.

Moose is the first LLS. Ambassador to
Benin since line. No years aiter a
military coup in 1972. the government oi
tllen named Dahomey decided to follow a
Marxistteninist ideology, “Because oi
the sharp change in ideologies. we entered
what we like to refer to as a “period 01
strain,’ " Moose said

Even While relations were strained bet—
ween the two countries. the US. maintain-
ed a mission in Benin There also is a
Peace Corps program in the country
which. according to Moose. “is highly ap-
preciated,"

Due to Benin's status as one 01 the
poorest countries in the world. the ruling
government decided to improve relations
with the West in order to take advantage of
available aid, Western Europe and the
u.s. arc the primary sources oi aid ior
Alrican countries. Mouse 5 d

irom the drought that has aiiected other
parts oi Airica. The country was in iact
declared an oiiicial disaster area in 1933.
However. rains later in the year changed
the situation.

'Benin is not a disaster area Momie
said. “There was a bit oi a drought pro-
blem but last year Benin produced‘ a
bumper crop.‘ ’lhe crop was so large that
Benin sold its surplus to neighboring
Niger. he said. i

while the Soviet Union maintains an em~
bassy n Benin and has technical adviso'rs
in the country. there is no great Soviet
presence according to Moose. There is no
Soviet military in the coun y and the rela-
tions between Benin and the Soviet Union
are “on pretty much the same ground as
[with] anyone else," Moose said.

Moose credits h ime spent in Grinnéll
as being responsible ior his career in the
ioreign service. “Grinnell sparked my in
terest in ioreign relations “ he said

“From Grinnell I took an internship with
the State Department in the summer ‘oi
1966 I iollowed that up with an internship

in Mexico city in 1967.”
