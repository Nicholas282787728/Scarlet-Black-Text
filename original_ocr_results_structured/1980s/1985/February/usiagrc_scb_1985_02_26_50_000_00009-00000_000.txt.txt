play debut this Friday night and I'm not

l feel bad (or two reasons: one. I'm not

‘certain that watching “Bloom County"

,creator Berke Breathed Friday night will
he as much iun as reading the cartoon

revery day and; two. my next-door
neighbor is a good guy and deserves me in

‘his audience.

The play is called "Named tor Conve»
nience" (Arena Theatre: Friday. Satur-
.day and Sunday nights; 8:00 pm and the
playwright is conveniently named
[Christopher Taylor (Read Pit; Room 5015:
hours vary).

.than Friday l'd be watching Christopher's
play. but Breathed’s appearance is a rare

Iopportunity to. well . . . to see him. How
entertaining can a cartoonist be alone on

Dan empty stage?

' l admit it, I'm not being a very good
neighbor. I should see the opening oi

.christopher's play while he's still poor and
obscure it for no other reason than I’ll be

famous.

rich and iamous. However. 1 know a good
opportunity ior exploitation when I see it.

Christopher also careiully cultivates the
look oi the haggard artist. shaving ir-

Eating exclusively on South Campus.
Christopher usually shuns meat in lavar of
fruits and nuts.

He is irom Minneapolis, the theater
capital oi the Midwest and the largest city
in the only state captured by Walter Mona

breaks there.

Christopher's politics are liberal. He has
a guncontrol poster outside his room and
posted a hand-made sign aiter Ronald
Reagan’s re-election stating: “Ii 40 million
people believe in a stupid idea it is still a
stupid idea.“

He once requested that the iloor's phone
booth near his room be kept shut alter ten

was his castle and he didn't want to be
disturbed. Everyone ignored his request.

Grounds for
Thought

Ellen Weimtock

Register. 2/!2/85)

Bennett's sentiments that not all young
people should go to college, and that
students should be more critical of which
colleges they choose. sound like the rave
ings of an armchair idealist. If students
are having their iunding slashed to the
bedrock, is their first thought always going
to be the quality oi the institution they plan
to attend? Something tells me that the
price oi their prospective colleges might
count ior something too.

The (act that not all the young’uns are
going to college is not necessarily con~
structive either, Yes. it might somewhat
increase the prestige at a college degree,
but is a college degree something one
ought to obtain merely ior prestige? Would
this lead to the ones who didn't go to col»
lege getting usetul jobs or otherwise con»

last birthday and International Relations
final were on the same day. Christopher
left a humorous birthday note on this

reporter's door. This reporter still has the
note.

Christopher is a devoted student/tiles,
pian, spending most oi his waking hours
either studying or working on a play. Alter
performing in ”Waiting ior Godot" last
semester he hit the hooks instead oi joining.
the rest of the cast at. the Pub. ',

And that's what it is likeliving next to an
aspiring playwright The “inside poop." as.
it were. ,

.When journalism write articles about;
Christopher in the iuture they may never
mention any of the truevta-liie items I.
have. ' ' '

And iihis play ilops this weekend and he;
is forced to abandon the theater and sell in
surance to make a living. it won't b '
because of lack oi exposure. See you at th

A friend at mine recently decided to '
compose a History paper ior Mr. Pringle’s.
Basic Issues class entirely in limerick
The limericks dealt with the subjects re
quired by the paper assignment, but in a
obviously light-handed way. .

when the paper was returned a iew days
later. Mr. Pringle's only comment was:

There once was a student who chose.

To write limericks instead ol clear pro _
se; '

His paper's a “".c

But rewritten would be. .

Graded higher. it he's so disposed,

Might it not be possible that instead we '~
would just have growing unemployment
and an epidemic oi young people lying :
around their parents’ houses feeling:
despondent at their inability to find '
something worthwhile or paying to do?
The increase in the unemployed. many of
whom would never have worked. and '
thereiore not be eligible ior unemployment
insurance. would lead to increases in the
welfare rolls and collections lor food
stamps. ’
Despite the desire ior prestige by. the
holders of college degrees. the (act at the
matter is that a system already operates
ior prestige, People who have more than
the sketchiest knowledge at what colleges
are about can give some sort oi rank order
to colleges anyhow. otherwise. why would
people be» so reverent about the Ivy
League? People know that Harvard is
“better” than Grinnell. but Grindell is
“better" than Coe. ‘
Then, of course. there is the assumptio
inherent in Bennett’s and Reagan’s dec
sion that colleges are like car factories 7
since their ideal people naturally want a .
good education, and in a capita st
economy producer must produce what the
consumer wants. education will just get
“better" because we're letting only the
wiser consumers into the schools. But are
