A Grinnell graduate leading a
rebellionl?! Never right? wrong!
Because that‘s what is happening in
Sudan. .lohn Gareng de Mobler graduated

in Economics, He is now organizing and
leading a rebellion in the south ol Sudan.

originally based in Ethiopia. but it is
rumoured that he has now moved his base

, vil unrest began over a year ago as the
southerners. who are predominantly
Christian. darkerrskinned. and more
typically subsaharan Airican, became in

l Sharia law lorblds alcohol and sex with
anyone other than the person to whom an

flogging or prison terms and fines. Both
{‘hristians and Muslims can be sentenc-
ed. as can both males and lemales. but
only Muslim males are permitted to
observe the execution of the sentences.
A Sharia also instituted lslamic traditions.
such as Ramadan e a month oi lasting —

as national law.

The institution of Sharia Law. along with
worsening economic conditions and pro-
Islamic government. greatly agitated the
southerners. Many or the southerners in
the Sudanese Armed Forces detected to
join their comrades in rebellion against
the Sudanese government,

The rebels began taking over towns and
frequently traveled routes. skirmishes
with the Sudanese army and seizures of
towns resulted in more arms and amm
tion tor the rebels. They used the surr n-
ding landscape to aid in their guerrilla
warefare tactics.

in early 1984, the rebels attacked a barge
outside of Bentiu and headed up the Nile
River to a Chevron exploration site. loaded
with supplies and personnel.

The rebels gained international atten-
tion for the event. Since then, skirmishes
have increased in number and intensity.
President Nimen has finally realized that
he has a major problem with which to
reckon. and has sent the national army
and air lorce to begin dealing seriously
with the rebels,

Only, the rebels are not giving up and. in
fact. seem to be holding their own. This
situation is predicted to escalate to the
point at outright civil war by the beginning
ol February 1935.

Due to unreliable information coming
from the Sudanese press, and the inability
to determine exactly what is happening in
the remote areas of the Sudd and Bahr el
Ghazal regions. no one really knows for
sure the magnitude of the conﬂict.

The rebels have not said that they wish
to create their own new country. rather
they desire more representation, equal
treatment. realization ot the religious prinv
ciples, and improved economic conditions.

The problem is that the southerners and
the northerner: are so diiterent culturally
that it might indeed be better for them to
create two separate states. The south or
Sudan ls much more fertile than the north.
but the north has access to the Red Sea.
This would create problems tor both sides.

Perhaps a compromise can be
negotiated. but it will be quite some time in
coming.
