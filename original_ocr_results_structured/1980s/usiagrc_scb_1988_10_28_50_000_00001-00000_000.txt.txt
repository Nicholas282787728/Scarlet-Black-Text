Dukakis—Bentsen ticket wins straw oll
Campus Republicans and Democrats face off

by Sylvia Bachmann
As most college students
approach their first chance to vote
in a national election this Nov.
8, they are faced with a complex
political process. Most of the
focus is on the presidential
candidates, but voters will also be
sorting out the candidates for lo-
cal ofﬁces as election day nears.
The Grinncll College Republi-
cans and Campus Democrats have
been working hard to increase
student awareness of candidates
and their views. Tuesday evening
the Grinncll Forensic League and
Mortar Board sponsored a debate
in which Democrats and
Republicans tried to win favor for
presidential candidates Michael
Dukakis and George Bush
The issues presented by the
student panels were reminiscent
of the two televised presidential
debates, the vice-presidential de~
bate and the advertising which

has been bombarding voters in
recent weeks. The Dukakis-
Bentscn representatives tried to
corner the Republicans on issues
of the environment, civil rights,
and Medicare. Busthuaylc sup-
porters confronted the Democrats
with questions on defense, taxes,
foreign policy and the furlough
program which had existed in
Massachusetts. On several issues
the Democrats pressed hard for
specific answers to questions
such as, "What has the Reagan
Bush administration done in the
last seven years for the elderly
and for health care...please give
specific examples." This apa
proaeh was not as effective as the
Democrats had hoped it would be;
it gave the Republicans an open
chance to make a case for their
candidate

in fact, the majority of the
debate was spent discussing

Bush, not Dukakis. The
Democrats repeatedly pointed out
the Republicans‘ alleged failures
and weaknesses, without enough
attention to their own party
strengths. Even in summary, the
Democrats said that neither
candidate may be perfect, but
with Dukakis there is "a decent
chance that he can do a decent
job." Democrats expressed their
belief that Dukakis has had to
devote much energy "just com—
bating all the distortions" of his
character and views made by Bush
campaigners. According to one
Democrat, some of the literature
on Dukakis coming rrom the
Republican Party is "the height
of sleeze and hypocrisy."

Republicans, on the other
hand, "took offense" at
Democrats accusing Bush of rune
ning a racist campaign and not
supporting housing for everyone.
The Republicans took offense,
but as the Democrats had hoped,
did have trouble giving concrete
evidence of past Republican
progress in some social issues.

It required a Grinncll Col-
lege student from the audience to
bring up the topic of homosexu-
als' rights. The Republicans rer
sponded candidly that they felt
Bush had not addressed the issue
in his campaign so far. The
Democrats agreed that even their
candidate had not satisfactorily
discussed homosexuality in his
campaign. Dukakis supporters
added that they think Lheir candi-
date is more sensitive to the issue
and has a good past record in
dealing with it.

Dukakis-Bentsen supporters (l.-r,) Dave White, Tim
Laughinghouse, Normandie Madden and David Karol

bate a straw poll was conducted at
Grinncll College in which 413
students responded. Seventy-two
percent of the students pol lcd said
they would Vote for the Dukakis-
Bentsen ticket. Twenty-three
percent of the ballots returned
were in support of the Bush-
Quayle ticket. The rest of the
votes were for independents.
Considering the predomir
nantly Democratic campus, the
job of the Grinncll College Re—
publicans seems difficult. Ac~
cording to Gene McClure, head of
GCR, any small number of Re-
publican votes for local candi-
dates will be important. Repub-
lican votes will be needed to help
counter the large number of
Democrats who may vote Demo-
cratic for all races. McClure says
that one of their goals has been
to identify Republicans on
campus since this is a significant
time for them to step forward.

McClure urges students to make
informed votes, no matter which

way they choose to vote.

The Campus Democrats,
headed by David Myrcn, have
been working to get students
registered before Saturday. They
will have car pools to the polls
on election day, and people at the
polls keeping track of those reg-
istered Democrats who have not
yet voted. Joel Shapiro of the
Campus Democrats says he has
been a little disappointed with the
level of interest shown by stu-
dents. "A lot of people who
know a lot and could do a lot
aren‘t doing anything. We need
to tttp more of that potential.
Student tum~out at the caucases
was terrific. I just feel there is
waste of human resources."
Shapiro feels, of course, that the
Grinncll College votes, as well
as general involvement, may be
significant in the election results.

 

PSN marches on Pentagon to
protest El Salvador policy

by Beth Wodzinski
On Oct. 17, Six Grinncll
students drove to Washington,

Dc to represent the Grinncll
chapter of the Progressive Stu-
dent Network (PSN) at a demon
stration to protest U.S. aid to El
Salvador. The students were Dan
Werner. Corey Hardin, Daniella
Steiner, Pete Haney, Tom Gregg
and Julie Runk,

The demonsuation was held
in the South 101 of the Pentagon.
The protesters blocked the lot,
which caused major delays and
blocked roads around the pen-
tagon for over five hours. The
police arrested 215' people.
Hardin and Steiner. to their dis-
appointment, were not among

them. Hardin said the police
avoided making arrests whenever
possible in order to minimalize
publicity.

Publicity was one of the
major goals of the protest, and
Hardin and Werner considered the
efforts to attract media attention
successful. The event was cov»
ered by the three major networks
and by many newspapers, includ~
trig the Chicago Tribune and the
Des Maine: Register. Hardin
feels that the U.S. media does not
give events in El Salvador
enough coverage, and part of the
goal of PSN and similar organir
zations is to change this.

The US. sends millions

of dollars a day to El Salvador.
Werner says this figure exceeds
the Gross National Product of
that country. The US. governA
ment supports the government in
power, which is controlled by the
Arena Party, against the
"Communist insurgency." Hardin
emphasized that the El Salvador
Communist Party is not affiliated
with the Soviet Union. He also
said that the Arena party has been
linked with the notorious death
squads which were responsible,
among other acts, for the rape and
murder of four American church-
womcn in 1980. Werner said
that "the bullets which killed the
