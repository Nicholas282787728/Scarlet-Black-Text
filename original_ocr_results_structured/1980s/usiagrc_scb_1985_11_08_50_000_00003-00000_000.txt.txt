ii_ .\ntlrr\r (uni-ck

Editors oi the Grinnell Review. the
school's literaryarts magazine, have
begun receiving submissions lor this
vc r's issue. setting in motion the long pro»
ctss ot compiling this year's 150 page
issue. Posters have been hung all over the
campus urging students to submit their
pocms. short stories. plays. essays. and
artwork; the deadline {or written work is
November 25. and the deadline tor art and
photography is February ist

Becket Hampton. this year's editor.
urges people to submit anything they reel
worthy. and she stresses that. contrary to
the prevalent behei on campus, the Grin-
nell Review is “by no means a clique oi
literary types who just want to get their
own work published How can an
organization with 40 people that accepts
and urges others to get involved be a cli-
que?" .

Hampton urges those wary oi submitting
their work lor tear or rejection to
i-cmemberthat "rejection is not that big a
deal, and in some cases unlikely because
we're working with creativity. rather than

The initial process oi selection starts
over Christmas break. when various peer
pic on the selections committee read over
and evaluate written work and write come
mcnts Then aiicr break the committee
meets as a group to decide which works
will make it.

Behind the scenes. working to support
the magazine. a business committee tries
to raise money irom various sources. Ken
iteth Forrester. business manager, says
that the bulk oi the money comes irom ace
tual subscription and sales oi the
magazine. Scraps also come ii-om Presl-
dcnt Drake' Fund. the Student Govern-
ment Association. businesses in town. and
the Rosentield Program.

Next year. the Roseniield lunding will be
cut oil because “they didn't reel the Grin-
nell Review tell under their jurisdiction."
- brdlng to Forrester. Hampton
‘ nderstands their point in discontinuing
their lunding,” which only composes $500
of this year's $4.850 budget.
