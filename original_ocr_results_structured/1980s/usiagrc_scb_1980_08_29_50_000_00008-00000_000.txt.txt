The Grinnell Defense:

by Richard tetchlnger

“Hello. it’s good to see you.”

“Thanks. it’s nice to see you,”

”So tell me, where do you go to
school?”

“Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa."

“IOWA! Oh my god, that must be
terTible and where the hell is Grinr
nell7"

“Now wait a minute. Grinnell’s not
that bad. It is a pretty, small, liberal

arts college . . . it really isn't a bad
place!”

By now everyone. new students in-
cluded, has had to deal with this all too
familiar attack on Iowa and Grinnell in
particular. But you have probably also
noticed that by the time you get started
on your vigorous defense of the school

~and the town, you run out of am-
munition.

So here is a list of facts, some im-
portant, some trivial, but they will at
least give you something to light back
with. You will be able to tell people just
how Special and unique Grinnell really
ls.

“Grinnell's founding was part or the
history of the American West." Wow!
What a line. It comes from the
background section of the college
catalog, You may want to use this as
the opening line oi your detense; it is
very toroetul. Then tollow up with
some of the lacts:

The catalog goes on to explain that a
group of transplanted Now Englanders,
mostly young ministers, came west to
set up Congregational churches in the
newly developing settlements west oi
the Mississippi River. In 1345 they
established a College in Davenport

In 1847 they incorporated themselves
as ”The Trustees of Iowa College," as

Iowa entered the Union a tow months

later.

Grinnell’s not that bad.

In 1854 Bachelor of Arts degrees were
granted to two students: the first such
degrees granted by a college west of the
Mississippi, In the same year Josiah
Bushnell Grinnell, 3 Congregational
minister and businessman, founded a
new town “5 miles west of Davenport

This is where you can really fire off a
quick round of ammunition.

It was to Josiah Grinnell that Horace
Greeley uttered those famous words
“Go West, young man.“

Take that.

Flve years after J.B, Grlnnell laund-
ed his town he joined with the Trustees
at Iowa College in creating a new
school The trustees provided the
Charter and he contributed the land and
two buildings. The school had always
been referred to as "Grinnell College"
and the name became ofﬁcial in 1909.

Il'you're dealing \vtth someone who is
concerned with women‘s issues, you
can proudly tire this one out.

In 1857 the college became coed and
in 1867 awarded Ils first Bachelor
degree to a woman.
