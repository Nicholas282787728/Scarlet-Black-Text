While dating habits or college students
nationwide are similar, environmental
factors, academic emphases, and cultural
diversity create a dirierent dating scene on
this campus tor the 625 male students and
the 642 female students.

agreed that their experiences in the Soviet
Union were significant in their understanr

and now understand these ditterences bet»
ter than many American students do.

When asked about the dillerences bel-
ween Soviets and Russians. the two
students ditiered greatly. Kina said that
there were no real clues as to who was a
“Russian" and who was a "SDVlet." She
commented. “In general. Communists are
more ‘SOViet‘ in their attitudes than ‘Rus-
stans.‘ but when judging ditlerences bet-
ween the two. I tended to trust my ”1'

Peggy spoke iurther on these dil~
lerences. "1 hate to generalize." she said.
"but in many ways a ‘Soviet' is more rigid

dent’s relationship expectations become
more challenged. For example, going to a
ball game is a lot more low-key than get-
ting dressed-up and going out for dinner.”

Many students pointout, though, that the
size of the college limits the number of
dating possibilities,

Lisa Pickert, assistant dean of Sludenl
Affairs, said, “I see and hear a lot of
frustration from students who do not find
compatible dating prospects in such a
limited population. Students will often in-
ternalize'these frustrations and put the
blame on themselves and their own
Character.” These feelings can be inten-
sified, Pickert said, in certain situations,
such as when one roommate is dating aand

Having worked with Grinnell students
for seven years, Bob Towner-Larsen,
director of Student Housing, can relate
well to the problems and joys ol all types of
relationships at the college.

TownerrLarsen feels the med housing

In addition, TuwnerrLal-sen expressed

This difference is CVldenL when talking
to Soviets. Kina said. “The average Rus~

he is willing to talk polilics "

Many Soviets are also better inlormed of
world affairs than their American counter-
parts They can discuss defense. American
loreign policy. and other societies easily
Kina also Said that they had no real fear of
discussing these things. The typical Soviet
is more interested in comparison than
judgment. as opposed to the typical
American.

Another difference between Americans
and Sovuels is to be found in their stanr
