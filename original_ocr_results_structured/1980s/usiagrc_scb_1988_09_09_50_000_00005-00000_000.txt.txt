SCA celebrates the Middle Ages
(as they should have been) at Grinnell

by John Newmark

In approximately A.S (Annos
Societatis) 13 a group of
Grinnellians worked together to
create the College of No Moun-
tain, a chapter of an international
not-for-proflt corporation known
as the Society for Creative
Anachronism (SCA) The SCA
was founded on May 1, 1966 at
Berkley University in California,
All members use that date as the
start for their calendar, so every
year begins on May 1, and it is
presently AS 23. The organi—
ration covers most of the United
States, Canada, Germany, Aus-
tralia. Japan, and many other
countries. There are chapters on
almost every continent. It is not
your normal, everyday, run of the
mill Grinnell College organiza-
tion.

The main purpose of the or»
ganization, according to
Seneschal Robert Feldacker, is to
“celeblate the Middle Ages." This
includes a revival of such activi-
ties as sword-play. caligraphy,
heraldry, archery, and leather
crafting. An attempt is also made
to recreate the political stnlcture
of the Middle Ages with Kings
and Queens, Princes and Dukes,

and Seneschals. A Seneschal, if
one had to find a modern equiva-
lent, probably would be the
President of the chapter.

However, the revival does not
stop there. Each member creates
their own alternate persona of a
person who might actually have
lived in the Middle agesr For ex-
ample, Robert Fcldacker, a
member for the past 8 years, is
also known as Hyrim de Guillon;
an 11th century Norman adven-
turer in Sicily.

On a regular basis. the mem-
bers compete with other chapters
in sword play and archery. These
competions take place at weekend
Festivals held throughout the
year. Some of these festivals are
at Grinnell, and thus bring in
students and members from other
chapters, plus a lot of Grinnell

Alumni who belonged, or still
belong to the society. Many of
the festivals, naturally, aren't, and
thus the members get a chance to
do a little traveling.

This may seem like it takes
up a lot of time. And it does for
those who get really involved.
While it was founded at Berkely,

it is not just a college organiza»
tion. For many it is a lifetime
activity. However, one can be a
member and still not have to
participate in all the events.
There are meetings Wednesdays at
8:30 pm. in ARH 25. and there
is Fighter Practice Saturdays at
3:30 pm, plus the weekend fes-
tivals, but it is up to the member
how much they participate.
Anybody can be a member. And
while it does cost some money to
buy equipment such as swords
and armor, the chapter keeps the
prices down alot by making
much of the'stuff itself.

The number of members here
at Grinnell ﬂuctuates. Presently
there are approximately 20—25
members, but it has gone over 40
in the past. 'A'rlyone interested in
joining, whether they want to be
a lifetime member, or just want
to participate here at Grinnell for
a few years and learn a little
about the Middle Ages should
contact either Rob Feldacker at
x4051, or David Haselbauer at
x3736.

 

Iowa native pianist joins
music department

by Beth Wodzinski

A native of Davenport, Mar-
garet Lucia never really expected
to return to Iowa. Nevertheless.
the new Assistant Professor of
Music is enjoying her "Grinnell

Experience" very much.
"Grinnell is a very special place,"
she says.

Lucia received a bachelor's
degree and a master's degree in
piano performance from Indiana
University. She then moved to
California, where she received a
PhD. in music theory while
performing with a professional
contemporary ensemble named
Sonor, under the direction of
Pulitzer Prize winner Bernard
Randsr

Contemporary music holds a
special interest for Lucia, who
wrote her dissertation about "the
visual rhetoric of piano music:
how composers use physical
gestures along with the perfor—
mance of their works." She cites
Krumm's "Makrokosmos" as an
example of a piece with great vi—
sual impact "What kind of effect
does it have on an audience when
the performer gets up and reaches
"into‘ the piano?" she asks.

lnternational students share experiences

Afghanistan. Costa Rica,
Greece, Hong Kong, and Spain
are some of the countries repre-
sented by this year's group of in
ternational students. Countries
represented for the first time are
the Dominican Republic,
Ethiopia, Ireland. and Singapore.
International students make up
six percent of the Grinnell stu-
dent body. This year, 29 new
students from 21 countries attend
the college.

An interesting aspect of this
year's group is the number of
students with varied experiences
that extend from their native
countries. Nancy Maly, associate
director of international admis-
sion. said of this year's reenlit-
ment, "It is one of the most geo-
graphically diverse applicant
pools, also the largest applicant
pool historically. It would have
been the largest enrolling class
had it not been for reasons like
political unrest, immigration, and
financial difficulties." Maly
works from her New Jersey ofﬁce
and will be in Korea, Japan,
South East Asia, and Europe this
fall to recruit students.

Here on campus, Maureen
Fitzgibbon, director of interna-
tional student services and assis-
tant director of off-campus study,
maintains a support system for
the students which includes an
orientation program before the
actual New Student Days take
place. The students are "multi-
cultural in that they have grown
up in more than one country."
said Fitzgibbon. For example,
Clifford Sell holds dual citizen-
ship from West Germany and the
United States and has lived in
South America for six months,
Norma MendozarDenton is
Mexican but has lived in Africa,
the Ivory Coast for six years, and
Thailand for the past two years,
Kunihiro Yamamoto lived in
West Germany for 13 years but is
a Japanese citizen. Two students
shared their experiences.

london. and the Netherlands but
considers herself Bangladeshi.
She said. "I used to study in
Dutch, but I did my "0" levels
(early high school) in Bangladesh
-- in English. That was different.
The transition from Dutch to
English and the social conditions
are different too." To her, the
Dutch are much more liberal than
the English. "I enjoyed my time
in Holland most because I lived
there when l was 9 to 14. and
that's the age when you‘re more
susceptible to inﬂuences of the
people around you which sort of
shape your personality. I think
that made it more difﬁcult for me
to adjust to the restrictions on

Noushcen chose to study in the
United States because "it grants
me the opportunity to stand on
my own two feet," She chose
Grinnell College because her
cousin recommended it And the

a small town but I didn't expect it
to be this small!"

rary music was strengthened by
her stay in San Diego, which she
says is a "center of contemporary
music, because so many modern
composers have lived and taught
there." Some time this year she
hopes to present a concert of
modem music that has been pro-
duced in California

"But," she says with a smile,
as if to reassure us that her
musical interests aren't com»
pletely esoteric, "I also like to
play a lot of Beethoven, Bach,
Mozart and Chopin."

Lucia is a goat admirer of the
3-2 program, saying that "it al-
lows you to get to know students
with more depth than if you had
to establish three courses... the
extra time it allows for research
or practicing is valuable and can
immediately be passed on to the
students"

Lucia is teaching Music 111,
Introduction to the Elements of
Western Classical Music (known
in cenain circles as "Clapping for
Credit." a name she feels is
undeserved.) She also teaches
private piano lessons. She
speaks highly of the diversity
among her students. "I think the
students learn a lot from each
other."

"In any liberal arts educa
tion," says Lucia, "I think it is
important for students to have
music in their lives" She is
bringing music to the lives of
many Grinnellians, not only as a
teacher, but as a performer.
Watch for her (and her husband,
Anthony Lucia, also a member of
the Department of Music faculty)
in the Composer‘s Concert on
September 15th at 3:00 pm in
Herrick Chapel.
