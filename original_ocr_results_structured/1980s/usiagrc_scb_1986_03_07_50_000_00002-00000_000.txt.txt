tudent Activist Speaks

on Southern

by John Harrison

This week, Senior Christy Costello
delivered the Mortar Board lecture on her
experience working with the Association at
Community Organizations for Reform
Now (ACORN) in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
ACORN is an organization is designed to
organize impoverished communites in
order to bring about change through
government and other agencies.

Pine Bluff is a very poor community oi
57,000 in Southeastern Arkansas. Costello
says that the town's black population,
some 51%, has almost no political power.
Costello spoke of the enormous distinction
between black and white neighborhoods,
Citing disparities in police protection,
street lights, drainage systems, and other
city services. Costello also spoke of even
poorer conditions with respect to gas, elec-
trical and water service, in the com-
munities surrounding Pine Bluff. She
described the sewage system in many of
the communities as nothing more than
open ditches, lrom which she said “the
stench was incredible.”

Costello believes that most of the pover-
ty she observed was due to racism. She

Poverty

said that there are almost no black-owned
businesses and few black professionals in
Pine Bluff, and thus a lack of positive
black role models in the community exits.
Costello cited discrimination in the local
government jobs program where white
teenagers were generally placed in skilled
jobs and black teenagers were placed in
positions requiring heavy manual labor.
She also said that the Ku Klux Klan is very
active in the Pine Bluff area and while she
was there she heard of at least three lyn»
chings.

Another result of the discrimination that
Costello cited was her personal frustration
of living in a community in which black-
white associations are very rare. She said,
“People believe that blacks and whites
don't have fun together.” Costello explain-
ed that although the schools in Pine Bluff
are racially integrated, it was not until last
year that the high school ended the prac-
tice oi separate black and white proms. In
conclusion Costello said “The racism in
Pine Bluff is like a hot summer in the
South; it's oppressive. . . it can make you
sick and nauseous and drive you crazy.”

Oil Glut: Fact or Fantasy?

by Jonathan Greising

The oil “glut" which has sent gasoline
prices plunging to the lowest levels in
years is not a true surplus, but a
marketing ploy by Saudi producers,
trustee Vernon Falconer said last week.

Faulconer ('6ll. the president of the oil
firm that bears his name, gave public
discussions Monday and Tuesday nights
sponsored by the Donald L, Wilson Lec-
tureship. Monday‘s talk was titled “Oil
Glut: Fact or Fancy?”

Faulconer challenged the assumption
that an oil glut could exist when world Supr
plies are known to be limited. “The world
is running out of oil and it doesn’t make
sense that we should have this glut,” he
said.

Rather, he said. the perceived surplus is
a temporary and artificial condition
created by the market manipulations of
the only nation with excess production
capacity — Saudi Arabia,

“I feel it's manipulated, and its pro»
bably going to come back,” he said,

Faulconer attributed the widespread
belief in a surplus to the media's treatment
of the oil market.

He said the Saudis, with a daily produc-
tion capacity of l0 million barrels, can cone
trol the world price with surprisingly
small adjustments in production He
pointed out that a recent drop in price irom
528 to $14 a barrel was the result of a
change of 3 million barrels a day in Saudi

Solow Appointed to

by Howard Lange

Anita Solow, assistant proiessor oi
mathematics at Grinnell College, has been
appointed associate editor of the American
Mathematical Monthly. the principal jour-
nal oi the Mathematical Association of
America On January 1, m7, Solow will
begin a five-year term as one or three
managers oi the journal's "Notes" depart-
ment.

Founded in 1594, the American
Mathematical Monthly is regarded as the
best known mathematical periodical In ex»
istcnce ll enjoys a circulation oi 20,000
copies and an estimated readership oi
more than 100,000 people worldwide

Catherine Frazer, dcan oi the iaculty at
Grinnell College, said “We are graliiicd to
have this recognition of one of our faculty

production,

”They could bring the price of oil to five
dollars a barrel if they wish," he said.
”They could also bring it to fifty dollars if
they choose." ’

Faulconer asserted that the Saudis have
created the “glut" to increase consump-
tion and to bring other world oil producers
under their economic control.

He pointed out declining oil production
statistics to demonstrate that world sup»
plies are being depleted.

Mexican production has peaked and is
now declining. Soviet production has also
gone down. North Sea reserves are
seriously depleted and will probably run
out in 10 to 15 years.

Faulconer predicted energy shortage
will impose serious constraints on the
American economy in the future. “The
United States is going downhill in terms oi
energy and there‘s no way that it can be
changed that I know of short of hundred
dollar a barrel [prices],” he said,

He added that few additional oil reserves
would be iound, and any new reserves
would be shortlived

”We Could become independent in
energy, but the cost would be prohibitive to
the rest of the world and even to
ourselves,” he continued,

Faulconer concluded with a call for new
technology to compensate ior diminishing
reserves of traditional energy sources,

“We’ve got to be ready for the day when
Saudi Arabia says: ‘OK, the price of oil is
$30 a barrel: What are you going to dol'”

primarily she wants to “maintain the jourr

to reduce the backlog of mail.”

Solow earned her BA, degree at the

master's degrees in applied mathematics
from Harvard and in mathematics from

CIA Recruiter Draws Protest

by Jonathan Greising

Students erected mock graves and
posted signs at Fell House Tuesday to pro
test the presence of CIA recruiter John
Hopkins at the Career Development oiiice.

Similar protests were held at Iowa State
and the University of Iowa last semester
when recruiters for the intelligence agenr
cy visited those campuses. Protesters at
those schools physically confronted
students going to interviews several times.
The incidents led to the expulsion of
several students from the University of
Iowa.

The Grinnell protesters, however, did
not attempt to stop the handful of students
having appointments with Hopkins.

One student reportedly had scheduled an
interview with the recruiter, but was
recognized as a protester by the Career
Development staff, who iniormed
Hopkins, The agent then refused to see the
student.

The protest was particularly directed
against CIA involvement in Central
America, where ”to agency is widely
believed to be participating in the Reagan
Administration's Covert war against the
Nicaraguan Sandinista regime.

Professor Robert D. Grey, chairman of
the political science department at Grin-
l ell College, has been selected as a fellow
'n the Institute of European Studies' faculr
y seminar on contemporary Poland.

The seminar, to be held this summer i
t usﬂia and Poland, is designed as a
advanced-level workshop for scholars wh-
are already knowledgeable in contem
porary Polish affairs.

Fellows are chosen from a variety n
disciplines, including history, economics
and literature, as Well as political science

Faculty from the Unviersity of Vienn
and the University of Cracow will par
ticlpate in the two-week seminar as hot
lecturers and as fellows.

Airport continued from p. l

nell. explaining that when big corporations
are looking at possible sights for plants,
“an airport is certainly considered a
plus.” Currently, die nearest operational
airport is in Newton, is miles away, which
makes the journey to and from Grinnell an
obstacle new businesses do not want to
contend with.

The proposed airport is not directly con
nected with the “Grinnell 2000" project,
although ii built, it certainly will have
some effect on the town's future. Who
knows 7 perhaps by the year 2000, Grin-
nell College students will be able to fly the
friendly skies virtually to the college
