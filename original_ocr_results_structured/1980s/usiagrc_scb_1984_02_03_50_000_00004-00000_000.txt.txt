Op-Ed

A timely cause for the SGA

For too long ﬁle students of this institution have yelled and
been yelled at because the Student Government Association does
not do anything besides appropriate money for student ac-
tivities. Well, SGA now has a genuine cause that affects all
students here and everyone can rally behind.

The task of finding and procuring quality entertainment for a
school tucked quietly away in Grinnell, Iowa is no easy task. Yet
for 23 years, Georgia Dentel has done just that. This is a woman
who is willing to put in up to 80 hours per week in order to keep
us entertained. And don’t kid yourselves; this woman in not get
ting rich on the overtime. .

Quite simply, if the responsibilities of the Activities Counselor
are to be done professionally and effectively, full time must be
devoted to it. There is no way that this college can continue to at-
tract such high quality performers and other entertainment if a
person is expected to put in only 20 hours each week. Given the
stifling confines of the campus and the surrounding community,
quality entertainment, the likes of which few other schools of
any size besides us see, must continue to be brought in to us.

If the issue of an activities counselor only getting half pay for
half a job was the only factor involved here, there would be a
story. But there are other factors in this frustrating saga, factors
which make this a big story.

Georgia is not in the first fight for her job here at Grinnell.
Back in 1976 she was fired, along with Katherine McCluskey, so
that a man could do their jobs. The man who “replaced” them is
no longer with the school, but the two women are. And they are
both continuing to do fine jobs with the social calendar and with
the Grinnell Outdoor Recreation Program.

Georgia was forced to take the school to arbitration (the ar—
bitrator was a trustee) and she won her job back; with the pay she
was entitled to. Actually, as any Grinnellian who has marvelled
at a performance here on a night that would otherwise have been
terminally boring can tell you, Georgia is worth her weight in
gold.

Budget cuts are certainly understandable. A declining enroll-
ment means simply that there is less money to spend for acts and
films, which aren’t getting any cheaper themselves. It is a sad
fact of life that you can’t have something if you can’t afford it.
However, this institution simply can not afford to do without

Goergia’s talents and expect to compete for new students.

Furthermore, it is not as if she is asking for anyﬂiing extraor-
dinary, Georgia wants merely to continue working, unharrassed,
at the College. Her track record, for procuring activities and
reliability in getting the best prices, is very good, And her
reputation in the business is known literally from coast to coast.

So far, the SGA has not taken a smnd in the issue, only inform-
ed the Joint Board members of what has taken place up until
now. The Scarlet and Black urges Joint Board, on behalf of the
students who elected them, to take a stand and send a message to
the administration. Just two weeks into the semester, ﬂiere is an
actual issue to be acted upon,

The students of Grinnell College have come to expect quality
entertainment, and it is unfortunate that some in the ad-
ministration underestimate the service and quality of a Georgia
Dentel. The students of Grinnell College have also just elected a
new governing body to represent them. SGA must act now to
send a message to speak for the students: give Georgia Dentel all
that she deserves.

In search of a choice

With the announcement last weekend by President Reagan
that he is officially seeking reelection, the task of the Democratic
candidates becomes a little tougher and more defined, while the
choices facing America’s voters remain uninspiring.

For a person who considers themself progressive, as many of
the students at Grinnell do, the prospect of voting for Ronald
Reagan is simply not acceptable As was noted in an 58:13
editorial last week, the Reagan administration has made a point
of rolling back progressive social measures and striving to in-
stitute measures that are outdated or even unconstitutional.

Unfortunately, Reagan has managed to keep enough people
unoffended so that his popularity in America smnds upwards of

50 percent. If Reagan is to be removed from office instead of
given four more years, the Democrats clearly must present a can-
didate and a platform that will capture not only those people
already dissatisfied with the president but will attract sup-
porters away from Reagan.

This is where the Democrats may have some problems. As
undesirable as Reagan is to so many people, the eight Democratic
candidates may not have enough talent and ability among them
to threaten Reagan in November. For the most part, many voters
see the differences between the candidates as simply too slight to
matter. (Do you know the differences between Walter Mondale,
John Glenn, Jesse Jackson and George McGovern on arms reduc-
tion or economic policy?)

What the Democrats look so badly right now is excitement.
There were surges of interest in some circles when Jackson and
McGovern entered the race, but no candidate has truly captured
anyone‘s imagination on a wide basis and held any prolonged en-
thusiasm. There is no doubt that Mondale is the frontrunner and
will be very difficult for the other candidates to heat, but few
would confuse his popularity in the early polls with a deep en-
chantment for him. / -

Only 17 days remain until the Iowa caucus gives the candidates
an early indication of how they are faring in the nomination race.
There are too many candidates with too little to distinguish
them. It is imperative for Democratic hopes in November that at
least one of the candidates truly distinguishes himself as a leader
and captures the interest of American voters. _

Now that President Reagan has again officially become Can-
didate Reagan, America finds itself in the middle of a campaign
war. This is one war which the Democrats must be well-equipped
to win. , «

The U.S.

and the
Vatican

by John Sharhnrro

Three weeks ago the U.S. govern-
ment, for the first time in in years,
established lull diplomatic relations
with the Vatican. a sovereign stale.
much smaller than lows, situated in
the heart of Rome.

Hlstorically, relations with the
Vatican have been variable. From
1348 until 1867 the us had full
diplomatic relations (Le. an envoy or
ambassador status) with the Holy See.
In 1867 the Congress. due in part in a
wave ol anti-catholicism within the
country. revoked funding for our em~
hassy there.

There were no relations with lhe
Vatican unu'l President RooseVelt sent
a personal envoy in 1539. in 1951
President Harry Truman attempted to
reestabhsh relations by nominating
General Mark Clark ambassador.
However, the move was defeated by
strong Protestant opposition,

Presidents Eisenhower. Kennedy.
and Johnson had no envoys. Starting
with President Nixon, who sent his
personal envoy Henry Cabot Lodge.
the practice of having personal
presidential representatives at the
Vatican has continued ever since.

The nomlnatlon of William Wilson
to the post of Vatican Ambassador by
President Reagan on January 10, sub
ject m slum approval, marks is sup
{award in American diplomacy. There
is no denying the Vatican’s impon
tance in world affairs, especially since
the ascendancy of John Paul n. a man
recognized in and wide for his
humanitarian efforts

The move is sensible and long over-
due. Unfortunately it was not made
posslhle until two months ago when
the Congress lifted its 116 year old
ban on funds for a Vatican Embassy.

Recognition of the Vatican will
allow America to join the other 107
nations that presently have am-
bassarlors at the Holy See. It is m
teresting to note that Poland. Israel.
China, and the Soviet Union are
among the countries that do not have
representatives there.

The nomination is forecasted to
have little opposition in the Senate, a
point that speaks highly for the
American public. Only so years ago.
because of fear and ignorance, the
Amerlcan public opposed such an ef-
fort.

Nevertheless there are still some an
chaic holdouis from a bygone. and
somewhat more bigoted. era, The Na-
tlonal Association of Evangelical’s,
National Councll of Churches and
Americans United for Separation of
Church and State all oppose the move.
They claim that the move vlolates the
principal of separation of church and
state, and one group even plans to sue
in federal court on this principle.

Fortunately these groups stand lit
tle chance in a U.S. Federal court, and
an even slighter chance with the
American public. Technically. the U 5.
government is recognizing the
political administration or the Holy
See, not the Catholic Church or the
Catholic religion. There is no Violation
of church and state.

More importantly, the American
public recognizes the advantages that
such i move will make. They realize
that the move will have little. if any,
impact on American foreign or
domestic policy.

When the Senate approves the
nomination, our troops will still be in
Lebanon, Germany, and other distant
parts of the Globe. The us. govern-
ment'will still be sending massive
military supplies to the semi-religious
state ofIsrael. and Ronald Reagan will
probably still be president

However, America will have gained
a useful ally. the additional respect of
107 other nations (including Great
Brimin) and one more diplomch out~
post through which she cuu possibly
inﬂuence international affairs.
