by Brian Broderick

Despite incidents of harrassment
and an assault of a student early last
semester. crime doesn't seem to pose a
mayor problem to Grinnell students. as
long as they use discretion.

Grinueu Police chief Jim Ahrens
nohed no dramatic change in the crime
rate in the past few years. but urged
that students be aware of how to deal
with crime.

Ahrens said that “We've been lucky
the past two years" in having no rapes
on campus, but added “there is always
a potential. thoug He cited delay in
notiﬁcation as the major problem with

police first. then your RA

“la good weather. foot patrols on
campus identify and issue warnings to
the types who don't belong on
campus." Ahrens said. but in the
Winter "there are only two patrol cars
working at one time." Use of the
Escort Service and locking doors are
encouraged.

Gene Engstrom. a Grinnell police of-
ficer who patrols the oampus area.
said “The crime rate has been so low
lately — knock on wood — hopefully it
will stay that way."

Dave Sears. another officer familiar
with the campus area. said that crune

Black History _Month was ﬁrst
organized at Grinneu last year. largely
due to the efforts and initiative of
Small. Last year the month was
highlighwd by the appearances of
black feminist author Michelle
Wallace and Psychologist Robert
Wilhams.

Though last year's highlighted
events were well attended, SmaU
noted with disappointment diut facul»

very substantial at the other events
“Not enough faculty members and ad-
ministration Came to the events.” said
Small, "only a faithful few — a small.
small number.”

Referring to the attendance of
events. Small said. “The support and
Bpmeciation of all studenm and facul-
ty is very iniportant to building better
racial relations” She also noted that
this year's variety of events would
demonstrate that “There is not one
Black Experience. it is varied 7 there
are many,"

Having consulted with Dr. JE

diagnose the illness as Type A, it is be»

The onset of this virus usually oc»

duration of 3.5 days. As of January
30. the Health Centers average of so
patients per day has increased to 90,
and on January 31, there were 110 pa-

things you should and can do First,
