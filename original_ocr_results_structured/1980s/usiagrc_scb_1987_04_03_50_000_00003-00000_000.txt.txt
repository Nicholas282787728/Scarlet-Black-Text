vicepresident and corporate secretary of
Manuiacturers Hanover Corporation, has
been appointed managing director or
Manufacturers Hanover’s investment
banking unit.

The Wall Street Journal cited Price as
one oi the first businessmen to recognize
the proiit potential in President Reagan’s
plans (announced last spring) to raise
revenue by selling government loans to
private investors. As a result of Price's ac
tions, the Farmers'Home Administrations'
Rural Development Insurance Fund
selected Manufacturers Hanover from
among 38 bidders to advise it about
packaging and selling the program’s first
series of more than $1 billion in loans.

The assignment is expected to earn the
banking company a tee of nearly $1
million.

new post "is a natural outgrowth oi
everything I've been doing [or 20 years,"

Grinnell College honorsrgraduate
Thomas Cech, a molecular biologist at the
University of Colorado. is one of iascien»
tists who Wlll receive National Academy of
Science Awards ior outstanding contribu-
tions to their fields. The researchers will
be honored in a ceremony on Apri127 dur-
ing the academy’s annual meeting.

Cech, who holds a joint appointment as
proiessor or chemistry and biochemistry
and of molecular, cellular, and
developmental biology at CU, will be
honored for the discovery of RNA-
catalyzed selfrsplicing oi introns and the
anlaysls oi the chemistry oi RNAr
catalyzed reactions.

Cech and his colleagues have learned
that RNA is capable oi self-splicing and
perhaps reproducing itself. For years

' scientists thought that RNA could not ac»

cuiiiplish splicing without a protein as a
catalyst, AS a result of their intricate eXr

eriments. Cech and his associates have
discovered a way that life may have evolv-
‘ed from the organic molecules that formed
the Earth. In doing so. they have found a
solution to one of Science's most
remarkable riddles — how the earliest
genes may have {armed and replicated.

Regarded as one of the most promising
molecular biologists in the United States,
Cech was a Phi Beta Kappa chemistry
graduate or Grinnell College in 1970 He
was awarded a National Science Founda-
tion fellowship lor graduate study at the
University of California, Berkeley, where
he completed a PhD. in chemistry. Alter
postdoctoral research in the department
oi biology at MIT, he joined the faculty oi
