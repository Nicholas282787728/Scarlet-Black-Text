Trying to preserve a 12-yearold
tradition. members oi this year's
Grinnell Relays Committee have
come up with a proposal which
they hope would reduce the liabili-
ty oi the College in ease of
lawsuits stemming train the sprr

members also believe that the
proposal would help minimize
, damages at concurrent events.
“Four {actors were taken into
consideration when we drew up
the proposal." Relays Committee

Editorial: Special Edition

This week the Scarlet and Black is footsing on
Central American issues. Though this special edition
does not in any way provide complete coverage of all
issues or countries in Central America, we hope that
it will provide some useful background and some in
sight into the problems of the region.

On page 1. the results of the infamous SGA
meeting of this past Wednesday are reported a SGA
bureaucratic bullshit at its best. The SGA has again
proven that it can misrepresent the views of the stu»
dent body while knocking its head against the wall
trying to decide how to represent student Opinion.

On page 2. there is a short article (“Support Group
sponsors proposal without SGA") on the petition
drive being sponsored by the Latin American Sup-
port Group.

On pages 4 and 5 (the Opinion Section), there are
several diverse opinion pieces...

Robert Curley eloquently presents a short history
of the plight of the oppressed Guatemalan people.

In an article by Nick McNamara, the imperialistic
tactics of warfare and destabilization employed by
the U.S. against Nicaragua are detailed in the first
segment of a two-part series.

Eric Green provides 'an accurate account of
political and economic developments in Mexico and
U.S.-Mexican relations.

Marcelo Triveri, an Argentine student at Grinnell,
gives “A view from outside” in his critical, yet sup
portive account of Reagan Administration policy in
Latin America.

In Ellen Weinstock’s column (‘Grounds for
thought’) this week is a critique of current US.
human rights policies, with references to policy in El
Salvador and Nicaragua.

Finally, on the Features page one will find an in-
depth analysis of past and present US. policy deci-
sions in Central America, The article, written by
Mark W. Schumann, is the result of an 88:13 inter—
view with Grinnell professors Joseph Wall, Theda
Herz, and Alan Jones.

iral America and the Validity oi a proposal addressing the topic oi
