Opinion/Editorial

LGttCI‘S ,

. A Call for an Open Mind

The campus is in a period oi change. The
selection of Women’s Studies Chairperson
is one important aspect at that change, a
change which will benefit all members of
the college. However, we ieel that an at-
mosphere oi apathy and ambivalence sur-
rounds the process of choosing the new
chairperson.

The general impression that we have
received from the faculty is one of an
tipathy toward the new Women's Studies
Chair. A lack of enthusiasm and support
among faculty members causes any
students to be unaware of the nature, the
goals. and the consequences of the
Women’s Studies Chair. When a student
does express an opinion, it is often one of
resistance. The attitude of the students
reflects the attitude of the faculty.

This resistance is a result of apprehenr
sion. Apprehension and discomiort are
typical responses to change.

‘ But such apprehension oiten accom-
panies the type of change which is essen- .
tial for intellectual and personal develop
ment. This development involves question-
ing oi our cultural biases and assumptions.
This questioning makes us uneasy. but it
also gives us a new perspective on these
assumptions, and allows us to change
them.

Women’s Studies is a part oi a con7
tinuous cycle oi change and reaction to
change. The common response to
Women‘s Studies programs and to such
change in general is one of fear and suspi-
cion among those entrenched in the
established order. For example,
psychoanalytic theory was intially receivr
ed with ridicule and trivialization. today,
however. Freud’s theories are an integral
part oi the discipline of psychology. We
predict that Women’s Studies will follow‘
this pattern and become an integral part of
the Liberal Arts Curriculum. What at first

seems mysterious, strange, and threaten
ing may in the and prove to be of great im»
portance.

' The constant introduction of new fields
of study such as Women's Studies and the
re-examination of established studies are
vital aspects oi academic development.
However, it is difficult to think of an exam-
ple of this reexamination in Grinnell's re-
cent history, Although the AfrorAmerican
Literature Chair comes to mind, it is an
empty example. The position has been un-
filled for almost two years. Not only has
Al'roAAmerican Literature not been truly
integrated into the curriculum, but it also
has been neglected, This neglect and
marginalization oi an important area oi
study forces us to question Grinnell’s
academic goals.

This questioning makes us uncomforr
table, but we should welcome the discomr
fort. Discomfort means that we are no
longer numb to new developments. Unfor-
tunately, many oi us on campus do not
wish to give up our ease. We are too com-
fortable. Intellectual comfort is intellcCr
tual stagnation.

The most interesting. exciting, and
rewarding courses, in our experience, are
those which most challenge our Cherished,
unquestioned assumptions. But. these
courses are also the most irightening.

As a sign of change, the Women's
Studies Program is both irightening and
exciting. The unease caused by this
change is the unease of growth. it is only
through constantly challenging personal
and societal assumptions that Grinnell can
maintain its academic excellence and the
personal and intellectual development of
the individuals who form the college Let’s
approach the coming change with open
minds. 7 Margaret Lewis, Ashley Smith,

Violence in Campus Movies

Dear Editor:

Graphic violence in movies shown at
Grinnell seems to be on the increase this
semester. Murder and rape are ireouent
occurrences in these films. Excluding the
special topic tilm series, eight oi the
eleven general topic movies shown since
winter break depict gratuitous violence:
rape, with men raping men Deliverance.
men raping women, women raping men
and women raping women Liquid Sky:
murder Godtather parts i and il,
Deliverance. Liquid Sky. It, Time After
Time. Prince of the Ci and beatings
Raging Bull, Godfather, Lit] d Sky. Il.

Usually there is sufficient iversity each
weekend to choose among films. but that
hasn’t been the case this semester. In fact,
three weekends have not allowed any
choice at all. Liquid Sky was paired with

Cowles

To the Editor:

Is anybody else as bothered and offend
ed as i am by the food-throwing that goes
on in Cowles Dining Hall" I know the food
service workers are bugged because I’ve
seen them trying to reason with the
perpetrators without success. This has
been happening for so long, I’m amazed
that no one has yet tried to put a halt to it
rm not talking about playful antics bet-
ween friends at a single table; everything
from ice cream to roast beef can be seen
periodically ilying across the room, into
walls and innocent bystanders. It's clear to
me that both the rights of the food service
workers and the other diners are being
violated by such behavior. I don’t blame
food service at all for not cleaning up the
food that is crusted on the walls after a
typical weekday dinner,

1 have personally been assaulted twice
by groups of people whom I didn't know,
and I've had a number of other close calls.

Prince oi the City. Deliverance paired wim
If, and Time After Time paired with God-
iather, Part 1,

The violence ’in these iilms is sharply
outlined and detailed. It is not entertaining
and it only serves to desensitize and
habituate members of society to those
Violent actions. Yes, there is violence in
Hitchcock films, ln science fiction Star
Wars and adventure movies Indiana Jones
and the Temple oi Doom to name just a
few. but it isn’t as brutal, graphic, or sus-
tained. '

Anyway, back to the reason ior writing
this letter. We are not Calling for censor
ship oi movies on campus. Just hoping for a
larger variety oi iilms in the future (how
about some comedies, histories, tragedies
and romances) 7 Douglas Susens and

Rowdies

Both times when lconironted the people, i
got responses like. “God. it’s just a joke! "
and “What a bitchl”, I have a hard time
laughing when my good friends play ex-
treme practical jokes on me. much less
when total strangers hit me it point~blank
range with an ice cream cone, and then
call me a bitch. Is this anyone's idea of
fun?

Last night when I asked one of those fun
loving guys it he wanted to clean up the
’shit (yes, I said “shit" -— very indellcate of
me) he had splattered against the wall
behind me, he replied, “fuck you bitch"
and threw a piece of ice at me; a half a
.vminute later his friend threw a chicken
breast at me 7 boﬂl were thrown at high
velocity irom about iour tables away.
They then leit the dining hall at great
haste, making sure to give me threatening
stares the whole way out, lest I should
report thElr behavior to some authority as

Vandalism Story

Dear Editor:

A couple or nights ago I asked to do an in-
terview for the SdtB, on the Subject of
homophobia in Grinnell and my reactions
to the vandalism of Sara Croft’s Negative
Space'art display. The reporter asked me
questions on homophobia and harrassment
in Grinnell.

i told him my thoughts and experiences,
and within this discourse mentioned, what
1 consider to be, the usual remarks made
by a passing car on a late Saturday night
or early Sunday morning. The nature oi
the remarks ranging from being Black,
gay, or just a college student, hardly news
and hardly a condemnation of Grinnell,

I touched on my views on homophobia
and what I consider the difference between
homophobia and extreme acts oi violence,
also my experiences on Grinnell’s campus.
I also suggested that my experiences may
not have been the same as other homosex-
uals he intended interviewing because I
was also Black. When someone is being
harassed who knows which is the forefac-
tor. being Black or being gay, and also be
ing both can make a person a more likely
target to one person or group and not
another. ,

When I read the article that next Friday
afternoon I was dismayed when my inter-
view was omitted. ! sought out the S&B
reporter and asked him why the interview
with me didn't appear in the article. The
answer I received left me, at Once, livid,
angry,li11ed with despair. and on the verge
of tears. Trying not to laugh, I listened to
the reporter tell me that the interview with
me didn't fit the angle of the story because
1 expressed. in my interview. that my ex-
periences as a gay man could have been ei-
[acted by also being a Black man, but
p'arts ol my interview could be used in an
upcoming article on Blacks and other
minorities in town. This did not seem right

' to me. I feel that if the 3&3 were dedicated
to an objective presentation of the views of
the students on this campus, on any sub
ject. then that should especially include.
the views of students who may have had
different experiences due to race, color, or
background. I resent the fact that my
Views In this article were not reported
because they may not have [it the views oi
the White students‘interviewed or raised
added issues and questions. The explana-
tion given to me could almost seem accep-
table, but not quite. I recognize this omise
sion as an act of institutionalized racism,
intentional or not. My remarks on being
gay on Grinnell‘s campus were removed
because I was Black and told the reporter
that the combination of being both Black
and gay could have aiiected my ex-
periences, Had I been white the remarks
would have been in the article. No crosses
were burned and no one was found hanging
——

i went to junior high school. so rve dealt
with this kind oi mentality before; still, i
was somewhat at a loss as to who i should
report this to. in junior high we had a
caieteria monitor to handle situations like
this, but there's no cafeteria monitor in
Cowles, It’s no wonder that the iood ser-
vice ladies haven't had any luck dealing
with these overgrown seventh graders—7 I
can state without iear oi making an unfair
generalization that the great majority oi
the people who throw food in Cowles are
large, muscular, physically intimidating
men, as were the ones i came up against
last night. Again, just like the boys in high
school. these guys rely on physical in-
timidation to getaway with stepping on the
rights of others at whim. They obviously
realize that iew people will have the guts
or stupidity to stand up to them, Better to
just go to Quad or laugh along wlui these
apes and wash the ice cream out oi your
sweatshirt. 7 AmyAmabile. ‘86

from a tree in central campus, but because
oi color my opinions were deemed unac- _
ceptable on a subject 1 ieel very qualified
to speak on.

This is not an accusation of racism
toward any member of the 5&3 or its staff.
Institutionalized racism is much too subtle
for that. Some people may remember the
subject oi institutionalized racism ap
peared beiore in the ssh. Ionly hope that
this experience can help some or the peo-
ple who couldn't understand it then get
closer to understanding it now, and if com:
mitted to Civil Rights and equ ity for all,
keep a watchiul eye, so that situations like
this one don't’ happen again. 7 Steven

I’m sorry that the reporter's declslon nol to
use your remarks in his story on the Forum Dane
dalism offends you, However. I believe you
misunderstand lhe reasons for lhe omission.

Ideally, a reporter collecting material for a
story gathers more information than Mshe can
use. The only result of systomohc lncluslon of
all quotations and other information obtained is
dense, unreadable new copy. Flnl’dhed new ""
slmies usually reﬂect selective Ilse of source
material, and the story you refer to is no excepr
lion in that regard

Newxwrl'ting is, among olher things, on in.
terpetloe process. A reporter ideally uses only
the material that will contribute to :2 clear, cons

Moreover, I believe it is“ Essential-tho: the
newswrl'ter or editor have exclusive conlrol
over that tnterpretlve process. External Corr
lrols on the process are n form of censorship
and can only interfere with ucrumte treatment

doing lhelr jobs. I think we are. .
