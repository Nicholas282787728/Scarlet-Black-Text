1 Letters: Outcry backlash

Dear Editor:

Although it is unusual to write a letter to
an editor about an editorial which has ap—
peared in another publication, the present
circumstances require it. The Outcry
editorial which appeared in the
January/February issue demands an im»
ediate public response which their bi-
monthly publication schedule does not per-
mit.

In the editorial on page 2 of the Outcry
the editors attempt to prove that their
phobic aversion to homosexuality rests on
a “logical” and “moral” foundation. The
half-truths and faulty logic of their
arguments predictably demonstrate that it
does not.

The editors first refer to the Bible and
present the same ambiguous argument
that one hears all the time in their attempt
to defend their position. (Although many
people simply dismiss the Biblical argue
merit against homosexuality because mey
themselves are not religious, I still think it
is important to establish the faults in this
argument because a large segment of the
population believes it is Christian even if it
is not.) The editors contend that there are
“many Biblical references to homosex-
uality" which condemn it,” They fail to
mention that these many reterences in ac-
tuality amount to a total of six, which is
very lew when you consider the length of
the Bible. .Although space prevents a
detailed analysis of the six reierencl‘
(Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, Romans l:2’1,l
Corinthians 6:940, I Timothy 1:9-10, and a
passage in Genesis 19 about the destruc-
tion of Sodom and Gomorrah) which would
illustrate that these references merely
reflect the cultural values of the time and
cannot at all be considered essential to the
fundamental beliefs of Christianity, two
major points need to be made.

First, Hie two references in Leviticus oc—
cur in a code of dozens of laws which also
instruct man not to eat any seaiood except
fish (11:12) and not to wear "a garment
woven with two kinds of yarn” (19:19).
(This is bad news for everyone who has
ever worn a piece of the ubiquitous cot—
ton/polyester clothing.) As these two ex-
amples show, society has discarded many
of the laws in this code. I think everyone
would agree it is not logical to believe that
one can select which laws are valid and
which ones are not. Since the Christian
society of today considers these laws as no
longer binding, people cannot logically in~
sist that homosexuality is immoral on the
basis of ﬂiese laws, for one law cannot be

Apart from the long discussion over the
Health Center alteration, members of the
Joint Board Cabinet and Committea
reviewed developments from the past
week.

Vicerpresident Pam Welch announced
that the 25 member student Curricuum
Council met and discussed the possib ity
of creating an independent-
interdiscipiinary concentration that has
been proposed by the iaculty Curriculum
Committee. Welch Said that an initiative
will be held in April to assess student sup
port of the new type of concentration.

Responding to questions about the minor
issue, Welch said, “Obviously there will
not be a minor at this college. The debate

’ has been going on tor live years.”
Although the members of Joint Board have
reacted favorably to the idea of allowing
students to choose a minor, faculty support
has not been overwhelming.

Welsh also requested that the members
improve publicity methods used to an-
nounce candidate Visits for the Louise
Noun Chair. Emphasizing that the areas
tion of the Louise Noun Chair in Women’s

Studies initiates a new program on cam- '

pus, Welch urged board members to ac-

more valid than any of the other laws.

The second point that needs to be made
is that although three references to
homosexuality are found in Paul's
writings, there is not one single reference
in the teachings of Christ, upon which
Christianity is founded. If homosexuality
was a sin, why did Christ never condemn
ii? Paul did, but Paul was a man, not God
or Christ.

Before I move on, .I merely want to re-
mind the editors of the Outcry of some ads
vice Christ did give since they are so anx~
ious to behave according to Biblical in-
struction. From Matthew 7:1»3, “Pass no
judgement, and you will not be judged. , .
why do you look at the speck ot sawdust in
your brother’s eye, with never a thought
for the great plank in your own.”

In the second paragraph the editors con-
tend that their aversion to homosexuality
is logical because it is not “normal” or
“natural." If they intend for the word nor-
mal to connote a characteristic that the
majority of the people share, then
homosexuality is not normal. 1 do not see,
however, how it is logical to have an aver-
sion to a characteristic which only a
minority of the population displays. it this
was logical, it would be logical to have an
aversion to leftrhanded people. Inex-
plicably thinking they had somehow made
a point on the “normal" issue, they moved
on to the “Natural” issue in which they
referred to the Kinsey Report. I don’t think
rm convinced that a 765 page report
published in ma which was followed by a
331 page book tiﬂed Statistical Problems in
the Kinsey Report published by the
American Statistical Association in 1954
qualifies as accurate source material. Un-
fortunately i couldn’t check the accuracy
of the statistic they used because I couldn’t
find it in the Kinsey Report, but evidence
supports that it probably isn’t accurate.

After dieir weak and pathetic argument,
the editors had the audacity to conclude
that their phobia had a “moral" and
“logical" basis, which it clearly doesn’t.

There are two reasons why this editorial
is despicable. First the homophobia which
underlines the editorial and’which clearly
emerges above its loud cries of denial
threatens the rights of myself and every
other homosexual. Second. the editors also
damaged the church by twisting the Bible
in order to use it as a weapon to defend
their own petty intolerance, which is a
denial of the spirit of Christianity. — Ray-
mond Pitchford, '88

Briefs—

curately inform their constituents of the
event. The next candidate, Elaine Tyler
May is scheduled to be on campus Mon-
day, March in. May is associate professor
of American Studies at the University of
Minnesota and the title of her address is
“The American Family in the 20th Cen-
tury: A Feminist Perspective.” She will
speak at 8:00 pm. in South Lounge

Welch’s final announcements concerned
the weekly faculty meeting. She said that
at the meeting, faculty members discuss-
ed the possibility of restructuring the divi-
sions as defined in the college catalogue.
Creating a fourth division ,that would '
clude the departments of art, music,
theatre, physical education, and the
library also was discussed,

ln other news, Laurie Dunivant was ap
pointed to be the SGA representative for
the Students to End Apartheid organiza-
tion. Dunivant will act as a communication
link between the two organizations to keep
SGA informed about SEA’S progress
towards raising funds for the South
African scholarship.

“Homophonia” (the repitition of one
musical line over and over, tunelessness)
has been declared the motive for the van
dalism that occurred last week in
Burling's Listening Room. In the wake of
the smashed “We are the World” records
we would like to examine the
“homophonic” side of things,

Those of us with homophonia believe
that We have real, logical and aural
reasons ior our being so.

First, it must be realized that those who
view life from a Christian perspective
perceive homophonia as immoral. Being
homophonic ourselves we thought we
should consider this since the Bible in-
structs us to look at the log in our own eyes
before we look at the splinter in another’s
eye. Homophonia has caused many pop
musicians to become extremely wealthy.
Though wealth is considered a stumbling
block to righteous living (one example out
of many: Jesus says, “It is easier for a
came] to go through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
God." Luke 18:24) it must be emphasized
that real Christians will not reject anyone,
thus homophonics are well within the
Christian community.

Second, it is undeniably true that
homophonia is perfectly natural. Some
people have genes for a tin ear, it is not a
chosen condition. By the same token,
however, some people are genetically
more prone to violins and chimes,

According to some studies, approx-
imately 90% of all homophonics turn to
homophonia, not because of some inborn
\lrge, but because of exposure to loud rock
music in their past. Thus, in general, most

heterophonics (melodies) do not or can not
see homophonia as any kind of serious
alternative to heterophoniality,

We do not by any stretch of the imagina.
tion condone or support the integration of
homophonics into the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir, however. Indeed, moreover, and
nevertheless, we do affirm the right of
homophonics to join in the singing of the
National Anthem of this republic. We con-
fess that we do like to sing along with the
radio and we feel that one does not really
get clean unless s/he sings in the shower.
We do ask, however, that heterophonics
not automatically assume that our atonali-
ty is “phonic” and, therefore, irrational. —
Mary Jane Constant ‘86, Terri Porter ’36

Events have taken place on this campus

‘lately that 1 find deeply disturbing.

Several strong anti-homosexual
statements have been made in recent
weeks (“strong” is a gross understate-
ment).

The first and mildest example is that the
restrooms in Hurling (both sexes) have
anti—homosexual slogans among the graf~
fiti on their walls. These “editorials" are,
of course, unsigned.

Second, as we all know, someone (or
some group) violently defaced an art ex—
hibit in the negative space gallery recent-
ly. The details of the defacement have
already been described in an earlier issue
of the 55:3; their clearly anti-homosexual
character is indisputable.

It has been said that the “rearranging”
