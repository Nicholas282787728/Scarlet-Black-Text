This hero is the quintessential loner: he or

left behind instead of Winning the war like
we should have, what is most striking
about Rambo is die hubris and hypocrisy
involved here. The chauvinlsm and
gloriﬁcation of the ‘Udber-mensch' is
distressing. The last time we saw this
phenomena was with the German
philosophers that paved the justifications
for Nazism a halfrcentury later. The
hypocrisy of it all is that here is America’s
hero going back to Vietnam. played and
endorsed by a gentleman that managed to
dodge the dralt when his number was up.

Monty Python

by Serge Strosberg

MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY
GRAIL is the movie that made Monty
Python iamous and gave them the certaln-
ty oi getting an enormous audience for all
their other movies This picture is a
parody oi the legendary tales ol the round
table knights who fought enemies like the
Black Knight and traversed dangerous
lorests. mountains and rivers in search of
the Holy Grail In HOLY GRAIL. the beau~
ty oi chivalry (courage. majesty and
loyaltyl is turned into complete
ridiculousness. King Arthur does not. ride
a gracious mount but Jogs. The slimey
lire-spitting terrifying dragons oi the
medieval mythology become adorable lit-
tle furry rodents. Knights in combat are a
combination oi lighting lizards (lizards
keep fighting even when a barbarian

)t*********************d human being cuts their tails) and blood-
" kegs. Monks slap themselves instead of

T he New ; slapping heretics. HOLY GRAIL does not
g just treat a serious subject in an absurd
c I N E M A :4. way; itis an absurdity byltseli. The inter
2t ruption oi the movie with silly and unex-
pected cartoons and the mysteriously in-
comprehensible ending make it possible to
watch the HOLY GRAIL backwards and
enjoy it just as much,
This absurdity mixed with highly
cynical British humor (you may not get all
their jokes) stimulate laughing with
enough intensity to break one‘s upper
maxillary. Do not say “Nnnnnnnil "to the
nOLY GRAIL.

Midnight Express
by Brian w Strause

Let MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. a ﬁlm based
loosely on the real me experience oi Billy
Hayes (portrayed by Brad Davisl. serve
as a warning to anyone considering enterr
ing into international drug smuggling, Bile
1y.a college student on summer vacation,
hopes to make a few dollars back in the
states through the distribution of two
kilograms oi hashlsh Strapping toiled
packets virtually all over his entire body.
he arrives at the airport with guilt tattooed
across his forehead. He is quickly ar-
rested. leaving the next hour and iorty
minutes at the ﬁlm tor trials. brooding in
jail scenes. and cliche talk of escape. of
course. we must not target the sprinkled
scenes 01 graphic violence when Billy
borrows another inmate's blanket. he is
strung up and beaten senseless With each
smack of the flesh. the audience places the
Turkish guards lower on the evolutionary
scale, The. Turkish judiciary system is
also made a mockery of. as Billy's
sentence is raised to thirty years ior what
the western world deemed a meagre Crime
In the 19705. If Billy's assertion that "the
concept oi a society is based on the quality
01 its mercy" is correct. then perhaps the
Turkish systcm deserves our hate. but it is
also necessary to realize that just being an
American does not give one the rights oi
the homeland to anyone abroad.

No prison story would be complete
without a healthy amount of allusions to
homosexuality. Turks are portrayed as
avid closet homosexuals, learing the
wrath or Turkey's antlrgay laws. Predlc»
tably. Billy. like any other “respectable"
1970‘s [ilm hero. avoids Ialling into this
"vein of devxance.” although he does have
the balls to bite off another man's tongue.
Here lies the fatal ﬂaw of MIDNIGHT EXr
PRESS: the mDVle fails to document the
real-life love afIair between Billy Hayes
and his cellmate. This deletion from the
book leaves Billy with little identity other
than that of “the victim" designed to soak
up our sympathies. as we denounce the
tyranny oi the Turks.

MIDNIGHT EXPRESS nevertheless re»
mains a shocking drama that gnaws at
your heart and spits it on the lloor. Billy's
lack of established character forces us to
look at him as a reflection of ourselves. It
is not hard to imagine this nightmare hap-
pening to yourself or someone you know.
After seeing MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. not
only will you think twice about smuggling
drugs. but second thoughts of traveling
outside the conﬁnes of America's “safe"
borders may also surface,

musical comedy Starring Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers. Fred Astaire plays an
author who falls in love with Ginger
Rogers. the divorcee. Through a case oi
mistaken identity. Rogers avoids Astaire
in various silly ways.

This lilm was the first successlul pairing
of Astaire and Rogers. THE GAY
DIVORCEE was nominated for an
academy award [or best picture'and won
the Oscar for best song. “The
Continental". the film's main dance scene.
is a wondertully choreographed showpiece
and is one oi the most famous film dances
from the thirties. Although the story and
some of the comedic routines are dated.
THE GAY DIVORCEE still has some of its
original charm, it nothing else. it’s worth
it to see Ginger Rogers dance in the pink
feathered dress.
