Break The Human Element

Study

by Gary Knoblock

Study Break. Entering the Forum, I
didn't expect I would be traveling to Ger
many, into my Childhood, and into the soul
of humanity. i walk through the corridors
Passing the Negative Space student
gallery, i decide to go in.

Looking at the works of art on display, I
am not particularly struck by them, Wire
has been shaped into the iorms oi people
doing various actions,

Slowly I begin to notice that the little
wire iigures have individual personalities.
Upon examination, some figures make me
smile, some make me embarrassed
because they are doing such silly things,
others make me sad. And the emotions
which I feel directly because of the figures
leads to memories or images 1 have cone
nected to those emotions.

A spot in my chest feels a little warmer.
I realize the little figures have done what
art does best': make me feel human. I have
spent too long in Hurling this morning
working toward long term, non-tangible
results 7 grades 7 and have not until now
taken the time to enjoy being alive today.

The warm feeling reminds me of my ex
perience living in Munich last semester.
There I dove head first into the easily ac-
cessible wealui oi that city, For example.l
spent long hours in the opera in awe oi the
beauty people are capable or creating,
while enjoying all the different emotions —
happiness, anticipation, sorrow 7 I would
ieel during a performance. During the per-
iormance 7 and ior days aiterwards 7
I knew I was alive.

My attention drifts farther away from
the wire people. Because oi the history oi
the holocost dominated by attention while
living in Germany. I begin to think about
Jews.

For some reason, ﬁle first few lines of a
poem my mother had tacked by her bed

when I was a child comes to mind.

WHEN THEY CAME FOR THE JEWS, I
DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING,

WHEN THEY CAME FOR THE
POLITICAL OPPOSITION, I DIDN‘T SAY
ANYTHING. .

strange, I don't know Why the poem
came to mind. Worst of all, I cannot
remember how it ends.

My attention returns to the exhibit. I
notice that not only are there wire people,
also news stories on the walls, The exhibit
seems to be a multimedia event to get peo-
ple both ieeling and thinking, There are
stories about the Iowa farm plight and
AIDS...

More oi the poem comes to mind.

WHEN THEY CAME FOR
HOMOSEXUALS, I DIDN'T
ANYTHING,

WHEN THEY CAME FOR THE
PRIESTS, I DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING.

WHEN THEY CAME FOR THE PRO
TESTANTS, EVEN I WAS SURPRISED,
BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

And with a cringe I remember the last
line.

WHEN THEY CAME FOR ME, I
CRIED FOR HELP. BUT NO ONE SAID
ANYTHING;

THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT,

Later that week the true power of the
poem struck me numb when I heard that
the exhibit had been vandalized. Little
heads had been violently ripped from little
necks, innocent neuter [lgures were made
to rape other innocent neuter figures, and
one had been lynched in the bloodthirsty
tradition of the Ku Klux Klan.

Most atrocious of all however, was the
pile of wire limbs and torsos with the AIDS
article laid across it.»‘Little people had
been murdered and humanity had receiVV
ed a kick in the teeth from this obvious and
outrageous antihomosexual display.

SAY

Letters to the Editor:‘

Dear Editor:

The Finance Committee of the Student
Government Association would like to ex-
plain its intent in proposing the Charity
Spending Bylaw that has received so much
attention during the past iew weeks.

First, our intent was by no means to
dampen the charitable spirit on the cam
pus, The purpose or our committee is to
safeguard the student body's interests in
regards to how SGA revenues are spent.
Specifically, we are responsible [or
guaranteeing that the money is available
to provide student programming which in
cludes concerts, movies, hall funds, and
all-campus parties. Contrary to popular
opinion, SGA has a limited amount of fun-
ding available and our budget is tight.
There is no room to move money from one
area of the budget to charity spending
without noticeably affecting the quality
and amount oi programming that is pro-
vided on campus (i.e., without the loss of a
concert, a movie, or an event.) .

Finance committee believes that we can
have both student activities and charity
giving coexist on this campus, We ieel that
the money that is intended ior student pro-
gramming should be used ior purpose,
However, money is available to fund
various charity raising events and ac
tivities for the Student body at which
groups might take up a voluntary collec-
tion. This has happened in the past with the
Younker Dance Marathon and Grinnell
Rocks ior Ethiopia.

In addition, we would also like to clear
up some misconceptions that have come
up during the course or these discussions.
First, Finance committee does use “pr0r
ccduralism” because it helps to insure
iairness and consistency in how and to
whom wc allocate funds. By developing
policies we are developing a long term ap
proach to son planning and expenditures.
rather than operating in an mcremcntahst
fashion without thinking about the poten

tial repurcussions down the road.

’ Second, the methods of accounting that
we use are the standard principles
employed by most companies and by the
college For the past three years an out-
side auditor has confirmed that our books
are in order and being done in the best
possible manner.

Finally, the FUGFAST involves no SGA
money going to charity. EOGFAST pro
vides an opportunity ior individual
students to make a choice about whether
they want to give up a meal and send the
money to a charity designated by the stu-
dent Coordinator's office. SGA acts solely
as an advertismg medium and helps to
organize this event.

Within the next week. you will be asked
through the reierendum system to vote on
allocating part oi SGA's iunds to charity.
We would urge you to vote “No" on this
issue. First one request is probably in
violation of Iowa state law. Even if the re-
quest is legal, it would cut into the limited
funds that are available for your student
programs. We encourage you to send a
message to these students that says, “No,
leave our programming money alone, if
you want to collect for charity come to us
an individuals and we will give treely to
those causes we feel are worthwhile." If
you have any questions on any oi these
matters, please feel free to conuact one of
us. Sincerely, — Finance Committee:

Mike Miller, Dave Simon, Karyn l\'yhus,

I power nap. Sometimes mildly. Often
excessively.

Mostly out oi control.

Late Sunday night I‘ll be camped in
Burling underneath mounds of texts,
papers. or notes, slogging through selected
documents of Hobbes, Locke, or Rousseau,
and I’ll have a seizure. “Power Nap!” I
convulse, and a dark mist falls across my
eyes. .

I dread it more than a scantilyclad,
streetrwise prostitute fears herpes.

Usually the warning signs of leaded lids
and a heavy head give me time to Set the

not.

Once I passed out ior close to two hours.
I probably would have slept longer, but an
angel-like voice saved me. I jerked awake,
banging my head sharply on thelamp, and
found myseli gazing into the soitest pair of
cleanblue eyes...

Strands of drool connecting my check to
the slimy puddle coating the open pages of
my calculus text clung tenaciously to my
iace as i frantically tried to wipe them
away.

”Hi!" I said through saliva smeared

lips. “Guess ya caught me nappin’l”

Stupid. I ilipped the book shut in a spon-
taneous, unconscious effort to hide the foul
goo irom the girl's sight and winced, sud-
denly remembering. She grima‘ced and
turned away. “I’ll See you later," she half-
whispered unenthusiastically.

“Yeah! ” I called after her good
naturedly.

I beat my head on the desk.

It was one oi my iiner moments.

It was thus that I began searching for
something to combat my awiul aiiliction.
And then, after extensive experimentation
and juggling oi my time constraints, I (err
reted out a solution: Saturday mornings

At 8:37 a.m., the crack of. dawn, Bruce
Springsteen's roar half-lifted me off the
sheets and flung me out of bed. Sweet luck

At 8:38 a.m., I dragged myself off the
cold linoleum, silenced Bruce, and leaped
back into bed.

was a good death .

At 2:13 p.m,, i became conscious of the
bucking oi my mattress. One or my room-
mates, a big iootball player capable ot get
ting smashed, head-butting walls, and
throwing up on the ceiling, was lying in the
bunk under me and pushing up on the mat-
tress with his legs,

Four o’clock rolled around. “Hmmm. I
better do laundry; underwear’s gettin’

l dragged my unwilling, overslept, 6’4”
heap down to the machines.

A blast of warm air enveloped me as I
tollowed my blessed, holy high tops into
the laundry room. Awaiting me were piles
and piles oi clothes everywhere 7 jeans,
skirts, Tsshirts, blouses, iiannels, socks.
Mounds of garish, glaring colors towered
7 mountains of searing gaudiniss blinded.

Of course, all machines were in use.
Some hummed, others sprayed. Some
spun, others sat. It was these that I check
ed until, aha!

A washer with female clothes digested in
its belly crouched silent, waiting for its
next meal. I learned over, reached into the
recesses of the Maytag beast, and drew out
various articles placing them gingerly on a
washer gurgling and lurching nearby. I
had almost finished transferring all the
washer’s contents over to the growing pile
when I dropped a couple oi things. 1 car-
ried the rest carefully, added them to the
mound, and then turned back for the drop

then tossed to the pile from a distance. The
other had fallen behind 'a machine,

On my knees, I reached to the back. My
fingers hooked on, and I drew it out.

Just as I had gotten to my feet, a girl
with cropped brown hair strolled in, lively
chatting with the friend following her. Her
head rotated around in my direction, and
her saucerelike eyes fixed on me. The

She darted iorward, ripped the

Her girliriend stared at me with a look of
disgust. I could read the expression on her
twisted ieatures easily: “You're probably

I somehow sensed that my explanation

turned away with a stoic face, loaded the
washer, and under the glares and looks oi
revulsion, marched stiffly through Hie
doorway. My jaw clenched tightly as I
made my way back to the dorm.

As I walked in, my roommate asked,
“Did you find a free machine?” I climbed
up on the top bunk silently, without
answering. Pulling the soft blanket up
around my shoulders, i lay back,
