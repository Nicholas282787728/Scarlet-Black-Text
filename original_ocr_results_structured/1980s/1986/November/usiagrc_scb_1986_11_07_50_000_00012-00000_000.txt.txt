tion 7 including heads oi proiessional
associations. private ioundation ad-
mlnistrators. and over 400 current college
and university presidents 7 were
surveyed. Each was asked to Identify five
persons whom they considered to be the
most effective College presidents in the na-
tion.

The study was conducted by D J mes

Coon pointed to America's association
with Israel as the reason for the ”dissipa-
tion oi a iine legacy."

“It doesn‘t give us the access or the
credibility we used to have," Coon said.

Coon has “positive feelings” about the
{oralgn service. The foreign serviceis “the
best way to get to perspectives on world
events." he said. “Foreign service officers
have a better persepctive than the
Washington people.”

He speculated that the world will
become more quarrelsome, so there will
he a need ior quiet diplomacy.

Although he said that his first
assignments were his most memorable,
Coon said'that this is only because he was
new at his job, and that, in fact, every
overseas assignment he had was in-
teresting and exciting.

Coon expressed his positive impression
of Grinnell College. “Grinnell is peaceful
and happy If the only thing you have to
tight about is the new-logo then things
Can’t be too bad here," he said.

Pritsch is already looking for strong
replacements. “If i get one or two outstan-
ding forwards and an outstanding mid-
fielder." said Pfltsch, “next year. we
could be outstanding, '

With a Junior Varsity record (4-0-1) that
reeks of potential. Coach Pfltsch should
not have to look far. “I‘m reluctant to go
out and get good soccer players," he cons
eluded, ”because I think we have about
forty 0! them right here."

Two years ago, Grinnell defeated Lake
Forest in the Conference match. This year.
although losing to Lake Forest, the
Pioneers' level or playing was con-
siderably improved. “I think (the game)
was really evenlv Dlaved.” said Noll. “but

we're probably a better team overall."

Closing the varsity season with a record
oi 5-7-2, Coach Pfitsch remarked. “It was a
good year." "We didn't win as many
games as we lost." he went on. “but we
played well."
