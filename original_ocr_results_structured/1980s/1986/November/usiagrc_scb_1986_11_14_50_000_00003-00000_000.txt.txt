FOG-Fast Results

by Susan Prout

On October 31, 459 Grinneil students par-
ticipated in the semi-annual FOG-Fast.

For each student who signed up for the
FOG-Fast. $1.65 was given to the United‘
Way. This cost is taken [mm the average .
cost of food per meal (including special
dinners), Costs associated with labor 'were
not part or this average, according to Dave
McConnell, Director of Dining Services.

“Most students were willing to par-
ticipate, but a [ew relt not enough money
went to the United Way," Julie
Bockenstedt, Assistant to the Student
Coordinator, said. Bockenstedt worked

outside dining halls gathering signatures
for the last. McConnell expressed satisfac-
tion with the fact that almost a third of the
campus took part in the last.

FOGFast started in the 60's and has
been kept as a means for groups to raise
iunds tor special projects. “In the old days
when fasting was more popular, the fast
was used as a vehicle to suooort a variety
of projects," McConnel said. Now many of
the students do not fast and instead ”go up-
town and have a pizza with their buds.”

Faculty Denounces
Homophobic Acts

by John liarrison

This week. the college faculty approved
a resolution condemning the recent
distributiuon of antirhomosexual leallets
on campus. By secret ballot, the resolution
was approved with 61 votes in iavor and 5

votes against and one abstention. The

. following is the text of the passed resolur

lion:

During the week ol October 27th a person
or persons anonymously displayed on the
campus of the college scurrilous leallets
evidently designed to abuse, humiliate,
harass, and intimidate gay and lesbian
members oi the college, Moreover, two
leaders of the Grinnell College Gay Com-
munity and other members or the Ad
visory Board of the Human Resources
Center received such leaflets, unsigned
and unacknowledged, in their campus post
oflice boxes,

Tederman said that disciplinary action
would involve being brought belore the
President‘s Hearing Board. as is
customary with cases ol student harassc
ment, and students who have received the

posters would have the option oi pressing

criminal charges.

According to Tederman, many members
oi stall and President George Drake have
expressed abhorrence or the posters. “We
are concerned that someone who could do
something like this against gays might try
to do the same thing to other campus
minorities," he said.

users as well.
“I don‘t know what to say," said a
sophomore, “the media seems to say
that’s where the problem is coming from;
nobody gives evidence the other way."

Although the generally liberal and ac»
cepting attitudes that prevail among
students do not indicate a rise in
homophobia, it is diflicult to reach an ace
curate consensus by simply questioning a
tew people. A senior addressed the pro-
blem as a fear which “usually makes itseli
apparent only in insidious ways and cannot
be neatly cataloged. fully understood, or
rationally expressed."

Hope was expressed that the opening oi
the Human Resource Center and Gay
Resource Center will help to break the ir-
rationality and better iniorm people about
the issues.

projected contribution should be ranked
above standardized test results in the
evaluation or an applicant.

“When evaluating a person for admis
sion to this college, we should try as much
as [newbie to look at the whole person," he
said. EISalrar indicated that the students
to whom he had talked ielt that the pro-
mise of contribution served as a more ac-
curate criterion in this evaluition process.

 

The anonymous distribution of materials
of this kind threatens not only the well-
being of gay and lesbian members of the
college, but responsibility [or what one
says and does; it insults and injures
members of the college who have done
nothing to warrant insult and injury; it
damages the respect that all members of
the college may rightly expect from one
another; and it repudiates the spirit of
responsible truth-seeking that lies at the
heart of the college's purpose.

Therefore, the' iacuity ol Grinnell Col
lege reprehends the distribution and cir~
culation of anonymous materials of this
kind and warns that anyone who engages
in such activity engages in behavior incon-
slstent with continued membership in the
college,

“We think it's a very sad thing that these
things [the homophobic letters] happen
but we're also not stupid, and we expect to
get things like this,”‘Baker said.

“But we do not accept it," said Jolly.

Baker noted that around some graffiti on !

campus, “about tour or five different peo- . ‘
pie wrote, ‘This is a homophobic state- ,
ment' . . . We would never have seen this
before Ever. People are realizing what’s
going on, realizing what homophobia is."

Faculty have also expressed their sup-
port. After the convocation featuring gay
civil liberties activist, attorney Donna Hit-
chens, “professors came up to me and said
this was a really great convocation and
that we'd like to encourage people to write
letters to Bill Deminoli expressing this,”
Baker said. ,

“There’s definitely a consciousness as to
what homophobia is and that it is not ac-
ceptable,” Jolly said.

This' Monday the faculty Voted 61-6 on a
resolution overwhelmingly condemning
the homophobic leaflets,

However, Johnson said professors must
recognize the influence they have over the
student body when the role of gays in socie-
ty and history is ignored in classes. 7

“When they choose to remain silent
about the contribution oi gays, this has a
very detrimental effect," she said. This
lack of recognition can contribute to the ig-
norance that permits homophobia to per»
sist on campus, she feels.
