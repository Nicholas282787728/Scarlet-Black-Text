Reaganomics

Haveman listed seven important ways
that the economy responded to what the
government had done. First, there was a
major recession in the period 0(1980-82, It
was the biggest since the Great Depression
and came as a direct result oi Reagan's
policies Unemployment soared iorm 7%
to over 11%. Compared with the projected
eilects of Carter's policies. had they con
tinued during the same period, the
average household lost approximately
$6000. said Haveman.

Next, inflation was reduced drastically,
from 12% in 1980 to 3% in 1934 Haveman
said that this was a remarkable achieve
ment for a three to iour year period and
was directly related to the recession. Inflas
tion was fought mainly “on the backs of
the unemployed," he said.

Third, aiter the recession, employment
grew rapidly, but the rate oi unemploy-
ment remains steady at approximately
7%.

Fourth. budgetary policies and the
recession combined to produce the largest
deficits the government has ever had. The
budget deficit now accounts for 5% of the

GNP, compared to 2% in 1930.

l-iaveman summarized roughly the
reasons for this The recession caused tax
revenues to shrink and unemployment
beneiits to increase. Defense spending in-
creased a great deal while Congress did
not cut social spending as much as the
President had requested. Finally, the tax
cuts futher reduced revenues.

In the end. the deficit was responsible
for getting us out oi the recession. This out-
come was predicted under Keynesian
economics.

Filth, interest rates rose to high levels,
As the government borrowed money in
order to ﬁnance the deficit, lenders in-
creased the price of loans, the interest
rates. The tight monetary policy oi the
Federal Reserve also drove up interest
rates The impact oi this was to discourage
investment. The housing industry in par

ticular was hurt by this,

Sixthsthe value of the dollar relative to
foreign currencies rose dramatically. The
“strong dollar" meant that ioreign goods
became cheaper and the U.S. trade deficit
increased to over $100 billion.

Finally, increased inequality and in-
creased poverty resulted lrom Reagan's
policies. The percentage oi people living
below the poverty line rose irom 11% in
1980 to 15% in 1935, This is a change OI six
million people.

Haveman next asked what economic
legacy Reagan would leave, First. Reagan
set the stage for slow growth during the
decade, He cited the sacrifice of invest
ment, which results in technological
backwardness and how Certain sectors oi
the economy were hurt, Also, the large
deficit will continue to inhibit growth.

Haveman said that international

economic growth is more tragile as a
resultoi Reagan's policy. Global economic
growth depends on the U. because of its
economic strength, The elicit attracts
ioreign investment. which could be in
vested in ioreign countries, particularly
those with debt crises of their own, like
Brazil or Mexico. The danger oi protec
tionlsrn has increased.

Third, there exists an “increased poten-
tial for social abrasion." More poverty.
high teen unemployment, the need ior
greater care for the elderly are becoming
more urgent concerns,

Haveman concluded that Reagan had
done well according to standard economic
indicators. Haveman gave Reagan a “B"
or “8+". But according to other
measures, like poverty, dislocation of in-
dustry, and equity. Reagan had not done so
Well. By these standards. Haveman gave
him a “C’.
