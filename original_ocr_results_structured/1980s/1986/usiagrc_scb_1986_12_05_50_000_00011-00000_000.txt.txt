Music
and Dance

The Grinnell Gamelan Ensemble will
give its ﬁrst performance of Javanese
music and dance 'on Tuesday, Dec. 9 at
4:15 p.m., in Flanagan Arena Theatre. A
gamelan is an Indonesian percussion or-
chestra which features scores of tuned
gangs. Xylophone-type instruments with
metal keys and hand drums of various
sizes are also basic to the instrumentatian
of the ensemble. “Despite its
preponderance of metal instruments, the
overall blend of the ensemble is quite
mellow and rhythmically engaging, so
much so that it has inﬂuenced a number of
western composers from Claude Debussy
to John Cage and Philip Glass." explained
Roger Vetter, directol‘of the ensemble and
assistant professor of music.

Java tor more than iour years, will per»
