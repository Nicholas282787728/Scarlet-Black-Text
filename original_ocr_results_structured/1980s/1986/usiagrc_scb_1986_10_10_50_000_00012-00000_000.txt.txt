portunitles to difﬁculties in interpersonal
relationships.

The media is probably not the ultimate
cause of this problem, and this is to some
degree just a reflection or society's current
stage or development, But the media docs
reinforce the problem, exacerbating and
legitimizlng its effects

Censorship is probably not the answer in
the longrrun, for that would be treating the
symptom without curing the disease, Cenr
sorship is not'. generally speaking, ethical
or constitutional. and the censorship of

There is no doubt that pornography is a
social-ill that degrades women. But the

Grmnell
nell says he makes no distinction between
hard and soft core porn but regards all para
nography as sexist and dehumanizing.
"I've heard the argument that Playboy
is a magazine with literary qualities. but
that’s just a load or baloney, people just
buy it {or the nude pictures.“ said Smith.
Smith also sees a correlation between
the problem of porn with drug abuse in
Grinnell. “Porn and drugs are real social
problems in Grinnell but they’re just no on
the front-burner of concerns yet." And
Smith supports the banning of por~
nography. concluding that it is “a cesspool
of attitudes which should have been clean-
ed up long ago.”

The Reverend Robert Towner of St.
Paul's Episcopal Church asserts that any
movie or magazine which shows women as
sexual objects is a moral outrage. In his
opinion. the depiction of women as sex
slaves "is not only violence against the
women shown [in the porn] but also
against our image of womanhood."
Despite his abhorrence of porn, he has
qualms about the implementation of cen-
sorship. “I don’t have any problems with
people speaking out against porn but I
have respect tor first amendment rights,
And porn sellers have rights. too."

dent.

However. as a society we cannot con-
tinuc quietly to condone pornography and
its link to violence towards Women. We
must choose to cnrl the lcgitimizing or
female subordination and vlolent crimes
on women. To begin. we must recognize
the detrimental eirects pornography has
on our society, and lhisshould be achelved
through more conclusive studies such as
the Meese report and the ctluculiou of the
general public.

Society is highly complex and rooted deep
in American socioeconomic Structure
For the Meese Commission to report
simpleminded and unsubstantial claims
does nothing but obscure our attention
to the real roots 0[ pornography, sex»
ism, Pornography is but a mere symptom
of a sexist society and until our political
leaders recognize this fact, any report on
pornography will be worthless.

Leslie Taylor of the college provided uni~
que' insight among those interviewed.
Taylor declares that the naked human
body is beautirul why else would God
have created us nude?" she argues — but
defines an unequivocal divergence bet-
ween porn and the positive representation
or nudity and sexuality.

“For me, sex between two people who
love each other is beautiful a sharing of
love and int nacy. But there is none of this
love or cari g in porn," she says.

Taylor . lone remarked that por-
nography it :only debases women but also
men by per etuating the myth or the sex-
ually violent and dominant male. “I think
porn doesn't show any kind of equality in
sexual relationships. And I think it
denigrates all those who participate in it."

While she refers to rape as ”more a
crime of aggression and violence," Taylor
points out that emerging negative trends
in sexual relationships, like so-called
“date rape" and sexual harassment at the
workplace are connected with the
prevalence of pornSYet she does not favor
an outright. all—encompassing ban on porn,
preferring instead the enforcement of laws
already in existence. “We have laws per-
taining to porn but we have to go ahead
and use them.”

Even if one is far-removed from the pro
cess or applying to colleges, this book can
be intersting to read. Many of the essays
are witty. some are impressive, but others
are trite. (One applicant compares herselr
to a recipe ror cranberry bread. Another
applicant says he has a pet elephant who
wants admission. Guflaw.) Collectively,
the essays are a commentary on the ideas
and concerns u_f a particular age group,
and are interesting for that reason. But, as

might 'be more hindering than helpful
because of the conflicting oplnions it gives,

Bodensteiner has also suggested the
development or an educational program
for adults. saying that “a high percentage
of parents feel inadequate" when dealing
with the topic of adolescent drug use.
”Maybe we ought to provide opportunities
where parents could be a part of a meeting
with these discussions,” he said.
