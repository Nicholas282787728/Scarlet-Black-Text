Dean Frazer to Retire; Outwitbtbeold
Duke to be Dean

By May-lee Chai

Grinnell College will soon undergo a ma-
jor administrative change. Last week it
was announced Dean of the Faculty
Catherine Frazer will retire at the end of
the spring semester and will be replaced
by Professor of Physics Charles Duke,

Frazer, who first came to Grinnell as
Dean in 1980, explained that her decision
does not reflect any dissatisfaction with
the college, but rather after thirty~eight
years in Academe, she felt “it was time”
to retire.

The Dean is responsible for, in Frazer’s
words. “academic personnel, programs,
and budgets , . . recruiting faculty, reviewA
ing iaculty, and matching that to cur-
riculum and budget needs.”

Also, as a member of the President‘s
staff and the executive council, which is
the faculty advisory committee, the Dean
serves as bridge between the faculty and
the administration.

A national search was not conducted to
fill the position of the chief acadmic officer
of the college.

President George Drake acknowledge
the importance of the dean’s role as

, representative of both [acuity and ad;
ministration in his decision to choose from
within the Grinnell College community,

“The faculty wants and I want someone
to represent them in front of the ad-
ministration, That's a reason to choose
from the faculty,” he said,

riming also played a role in the Presi-
dent’s decision. Drake will be on leave
next year with the Grinnell-in-London pro
gram, Also, as he said he is in the “latter
half" of his preSldency and is “anxious to
get going on various projects," he express
ed dissatisfaction with the amount of time
it would take an outsider to become
oriented to the college,

After much deliberation the President
decided upon Duke. ln addition to teaching

Bedell:

in the Physics Department for 17 years,
Duke was Chairman of the Faculty for two
years and also chaired the planning com-
mittee for the current math and
psychology building project,

Drake said it was Duke’s ability to work
with several departments and within
budget constraints as well as the fact
Drake feels Duke “is very well thought of
by his colleagues” that convinced him
Duke was right for the job,

Frazer, who graduated from Wellesley
College and received her PhD. irom Yale,
held two deanships previous to her tenure
at Grinnell.

Duke, who graduated from North
Carolina State University and received his
PhD. from Iowa State University, said he
was not entireley at ease with moving into
administration,

Frazer said her goals were to "enhance
an already strong traditional program”
and points to the development of the East
Asian Studies program, women's studies
program, and numerous grants — in-
cluding the new $500,000 Pew Grant to
develop language studies — as evidence of
success.

Duke also feels he will not attempt any
major changes but cited a need to broaden
the curriculum,

”We’re pretty department oriented,” he
said “That’s the way we’re organized. We

. get used to talking in terms of depa

ments. This needs to be broadened out.'

Drake noted that while the recent
developments —- Chinese studies, Sloan
Program, computing, Pew Grant. etc. —
“make us better , , , they pull us in dif-
ferent directions,

“What we lackis in general education, in
coherence.”

Drake said “There’s a frustration in the
faculty" with the introductory courses in

Democratic U.S. Representative
Berkley Bedell condemned the Reagan Ad-
ministration’s policies on nuclear weapons
and Nicaragua Wednesday at Grinnell
when he spoke on “Current Tough pm,
blems Facing Congressr”

Bedell said that the arms race with the
Soviet Union was “as ridiculous an exer,
cise as anyone could get" as bout nations
have enough nuclear weapons to effective
1y ”destroy the other country."

He cited figures stating that if only one
percent of the world’s nuclear arsenal
were used, the resulting dust clouds would
trigger a nuclear winter that would block
the sun’s rays for months and “make at
least. the Northern Hemisphere
uninhabitable for human life.”

“Adding more and more to that stockpile
is a pretty ridiculous waste of money,”
Bedell said, noting that military expen-
ditures have more than doubled between
1930 and 1985, from $140 million to $286
million.

Bedell also exprased his concern for the
recently approved $100 million aid
package to contra forces in Nicaragua.
