defense systemJ SDI (reported in Joint
Board as the 'Independent Concentration'l
was the result oi a two year evolutionary
process oi the studentrinitlated minor area
of study. The aim of SDI was lo otter a
sound alternative to the overdemanding
double major by allovving the student to
design and pursue an interdisciplinary
topical cluster oi courses in an area oi
study not presently established in the cur-
riculum Recently. the iaculty reduced the
number oi required credits in the existing
interd’ 'plinary concentrations in order
to altaci more interested studenls into the
program, While a step in the right direc~
tipn. the catalogued concentrations are
limited in number and cannot ahvays ac-
commodate individual student interest.
The SDI would meet the student need tor a
coherent program oi independent study
while consistently adhering to the educa
tional principals oi the college,

An extraordinary amount oi student
labor and genuine interest went into the
SDI. The Student Curriculum Council met

they like us all to leave so they have more
time?‘.’ Not a single word was muttered
about the impetus oi the proposal. Student
opinion was disregarded and ignored even
though SDI had enormous student support.
One iaculty member was gutsy enough to
say that student imagination lacked the
academic merits oi iaculty imagination
tpossibly a joke, PeeWee Herman is iun-
nlerl. Not one iaculty member suggested
ways to improve the proposal and only one
member suggested a trial period. They
seemed fixated on the stigma of “Student
deSIgned” and immediately accused it of
being academically meretricious.

The decision to reject the SDI is in
dicative of an Institutional bias against
student proposals. The iaculty at Grinnell
have a surprising amount oi power; they
effectively have the ultimate say on all
curricular policies. Grinnell's decision-
making process reflects the democratic
philosophy of the college ﬂ rules should be
made by those who will be afiected by
them. This logic is extended to faculty Con-
trol over curricular programs. because
who knows more about the curriculum
than those who teach it?

GrinnelI'S Commitment to promoting
sell-govcrnance is an enlightened one. yet
it does not recognize that true sells
governance niusl also include students.
Whereas students do sit on salient. commits
lees. such as the Curriculum Commi|tee
and the department Educational Policy
Committees tEPCsl. the ultimate
dcclsiunrniakers tthc facullyl do not allow
student input The role oi students in this
process is analagous to the placement oi a
cunuch in a harem; their impotence is
irustratingly obvious.

in iaculty meetings students arc treated
like children in the late lath century They
cannot speak unless spoken to, The origin
oi this 'gag l'ule' may be understandable.
There may have been a time when
studciits openly disrupted the meetings ol
the iaculty. but the iaculty reaction to this
problem oi lwen'ty years gone is too strong
Today. when our SGA vice president
presents a proposal ol vital interest to
students. she is unable to address. ads
vacate. or dcicnd her own proposal. In a
college committed to democracy and sells
governance. such a rule is blatantly
undemocratic.

The 'gag rulc‘ means that students can

only succeed in passing their proposals by _

conducting a lobbying eiiort that would
draw six iigures in Washington. DC They
have to convince all 119 faculty members
that the proposal is worthy oi passage.
What's worse. the iaculty does not like pro-
posals oi more than one page They insist
that legislation bc a single page in order
that they save precious time reading it.
This reduces the signiiicance oi the pros
posal and encourages existing institutional
disorder.

At a minimum. one designated student
should be given the right to speak at iacul-
ty meetings. Such a student. perhaps the
SGA Vice PreSident. Should be able to pre-
sent. discuss. and defend student pros
posals. and should be able to address olher
legislation that affects sludents. Students
uould not have to engage in massive lob-
bying campaigns as presently required
and the limitation to one page would not be
as onerous, tor a short student presentar
lioli would take the place of burdensome
added pages.

Students are just as interested in the cuiu
riculuni as iaculty are in a school ge»
iiuinely dedicated to the idea of selfr
govcrnancc. in the name oi consistency
and iairiiess. and in compliance with the
college‘s high values ot a strong communi-
ty. it's time lo dismiss the prevalent dour
hlc iandnrds and pri ilcgc the students
will! an equal voice in the college's
decision-making process. .

We iealize that Relays is a lime ior run

carried out in this spirit. However. in light
oi the recent increase or racial slurs on the
bathroom walls etc . the levity with which
these symbols oi the black community
have been treated niusl be addressed so as

ween students on this campus

There are more substantive racial pro-
blems at Grinnell ihan the masthead of the
Scarlet and Black's relay edition which
have not been addressed. I believe that the
racial problems at Grinnell are not with
Scarlet and Black but as a result of the coir
lege administration's poor commitment to
improving Grinnell's racial atmosphere.
As oi today. there remains only one black
professor_ at Grinnell and the Afror
American studies position still is unfilled
ior next year. .

Moreover, Grinnell College still remains
a very white school with less than 5%
blacks in the student body it also appears
that the admissions office is doing very lite
tie to bring diversity to the study body.
There were only thirteen blacks in this
year's ireshman class according to admis-
sion office reports.

Without question. there are real and
serious racial problems at Grinnell thal
must be addressed by the entire campus
community. Students and iaculty must
speak out and show where the real pro-
blems exist Taking clicap shots at the
Scarlet and Black stall is not a productive
or useiul way oi discussing the real racial
problems that plague Grinnell College. e
