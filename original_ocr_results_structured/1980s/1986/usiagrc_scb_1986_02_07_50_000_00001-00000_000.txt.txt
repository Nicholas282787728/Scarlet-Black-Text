adopt wait—list

by John Harrison

The Scarlet and Black has recently been
iniormed by sources close to the admiSr
sions department that a wait-list will be
utilized ior admissions this coming year as
the college attempts to control the size oi
the entering ireshman class,

The use or a wait-list entails placing a _

number oi applicants on a wait~list where
their admissions into the college is held up
until the college can determine exactly
how many oi the accepted applicants ac~
tually decide to enroll at Grinnell.

Persons placed on wait-lists are apr
plicants who have qualifications that are
not as iavorable as other applicants but
still meet the college's admissions stanr
dards.

The wait-list was adopted aiter several
years oi housing problems when an unex»
pectedly high number ot ireshmen enrollr
ed.

Over the last ten years. the number oi
applicants has risen by over 19% as Grin»
nell has become a more popular and
prestigious college.

Moreover, the number oi accepted
students that register as ireshmen has in-
creased by over 14% in the last seven
years.

An admissions department official
disclosed that because of the high number
of applications over the last ten years and
the very high number of applications
already received tor next year. the college
believed it to be prudent to adopt a Wait-
list policy.

One official stated that it would only be
fair to incoming freshmen that we
guarantee them adequate housing and to
do that we need to control the number of
students that register in the freshmen
class

In us. News and World Report's recent
survey oi the top ten liberal arts colleges
all of the colleges but Grinl'lell have wait~
lists as part oi their admissions policy.

Unlortunatcly, John Hopkins. Director
of Admissions. was unavailable for com»
ment on the adoptlon of the waltrlist ad-
mission policy.

Students complain of off-
Campus housing problems

The student also pointed out that there
are State of lowa laws in existence that
prohibit any landlord irom charging
tenants ior heat unless tenants themselves

by John Harrison

Over fifteen percent of Grinnell's stu-
dent body this semester resides in off-
campus, non-college owned housing and
although many students enjoy the freedom
that off-campus housing provides, several
Grinnellians have experienced difficulties
in dealing with uncooperative or
negligent landlords.

Many students have had to deal with
housing problems such as poor heating and
not being able to get deposits returned
from landlords.

One senior woman related the difficulty
she had in obtaining her deposit irom a
landlord who claimed that boxes she
stored in the apartment weakened the
floors of his building, After numerous
discussions with the landlord and a cer-
tified letter requesting the return of the
deposit. the student sought the advice of a
lawyer who offered his advice free of
charge. »

The lawyer recommended that the stu
dent, in order to get her deposit returned,
ought to take the landlord to small claims
court, Upon taking the landlord to small
claims court. which is held in Grinnell, the
student received a favorable ruling from
the court. Although the court demanded
the landlord to return the deposit money.
an appeal oi the ruling was immediately
filed and there the case has remained for
the last three months.

The student expressed her satisfaction
in that she could take some action against
landlord abuses. She said the case has
become one more oi tight for principles
than it is for the deposit money. She said
that too often students are intimidated by
landlords who have little respect for col»
lege students She said, “Landlords think
Grinnell students are rich kids who Won’t
iight to get their money back."

Another problem oiten encountered by
students living in olicampus apartments ,
is the lack oi adequate heat during the
winter months.

One senior expressed his difficulty'in
dealing with a landlord who charged his
tenants for heat, yet iailed to give tenants
control over the heating oi their apart-
ments,

The student involved said that although
he sets his thermostat as low as filtyrfive
degrees. the temperature is usually
around seventy degrees.

have “exclusive control" over the
temperature in their apartment. This
dispute is still going on. yet the student in
volved plans to take legal action it the
landlord refuses to cooperate in complying
with state laws.

Student-landlord problems also occur
when landlords let their property
deteriorate, One Grinnell graduate told of
the extremely run-down Condition of her
apartment.

She told of crumbling foundation. hole
ridden walls and perhaps most disturbing,
large rodents which were the size of small
cats, The student repeatedly tried to get
the landlord to improve the very poor con-
ditions of the building, yet she found the
landlord Very uncooperative. She said that
the landlord once responded to her pro»
blem of rats in the kitchen by saying. “It's
nothing a little housekeeping wouldn‘t
fix,”

After the landlord reiused to adequately
deal with the deteriorated state of his pro»
party, the student and her two housemates

decided to cease rent payments. Conse
quently. an eviction notice was served to
the occupants oi the apartment.

Yet after obtaining a free consultation
with a local lawyer. the student and
landlord came to an agreement on the un-
paid rent and deposit. Needless to say. the
student and her housemates left the apartr
ment immediately at the end of the
semester.

interestingly, when asked about the pro-
blems students have with landlords, Bob
Towner~Larsen. A55lstant Dean of Student
Affairs, said that he has only handled 4 or 5
oti—eampus housing complaints in the ten
years he has been at Grinnell. Yet Townerr
Larsen did stress the fact that the Student
Affairs Office does put out a packet of in-
formation to students who plan to live off-
campus,

TuwnerrLarsen added that. “we can ad»
vtse students and help clarify some pro-
blems they may be having, we can also
suggest some legal options available tor
students such as small claims court."
Moreover, TownerrLarsen expressed his
belief that most. Grinnell landlords are not
all that bad and that many students have
had good relations with their landlords.
