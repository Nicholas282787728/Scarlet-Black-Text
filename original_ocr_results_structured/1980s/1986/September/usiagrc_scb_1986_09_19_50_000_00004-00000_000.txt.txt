Grinnell:

Yesterday and
Today

By Sylvia Bachmann

The cities of New York, Washington,
D.C., and Philadelphia are famous for the
pictures they paint of America's past, but
no city has experienced more oi America's
rich heritage than the city of Grinnell,
Many iamous people have passed through
Grinnell, and the college and the town
have seen a myriad of changes since
Horace Greeley first told J.B. Grinnell to
“Go west. young man, go westl”

Regardless oi Grinnell's coloriul past,
students and even some of the residents
seem to know little about it. There are a
iew, however, who remember, and a iew
others who are helping to reveal the past oi
Grinnell. William Deminoff, a seventeen-
year resident of Grinnell and the Director
oi college relations ior Grinnell College,
has developed an interest in the roots of
Grinnell and has taken it upon himself to
compile a history oi the town, its people.
and its college. His interest was sparked
when, as he began to learn more about
Grinnell, he saw a need for a readable
history of this town. Deminoif says he‘s
“just a history buff” and the “information
[he] needs is readily available,” but
researching,'writing. and editing a book is
an extremely ambitious undertaking,
nonetheless.

Deminoff is aware of the economic and
political factors aiiecting the area today
because he is so familiar with the Grinnell
oi yesterday. He is proud to recall that me
Grinnell community was one of the
earliest proponents oi abolition in the
Midwest. Prior to the Civil War, 1000 freed
slaves passed through Grinnell as a stop
along the Underground Railroad Many in-
dividuals in Grinnell, including its
ioundcr, J B. Grinnell, were strong sup
porters oi women’s suiirage and lair
treatment of Blacks and Indians in a racist
America. In the same breath. Deminoff
explains that these views gave Grinnell a
great reputation as a “liberal” communi-
ty, but the religiously strict town was a
center ior the temperance movement.

Dem inoff's interests and Writings extend
beyond the political significance or the ci-
ty, to an area that makes any town unique:
its people. The mere fact that movie actor
Gary Cooper attended Grinnell (he lived in
Langan Hall), is enough to make some
people faint with pride. Yet the Grinnell
family tree has been revealed as one oi a
iascinating genealogical study. Deminoii
stated that it is incredible to discover “one
central figure, l.e.. JB Grinnell, who is
clearly connected with the rest or
American history.”

All My Children Go
to General Hospital

By Bruce Emoiid

Contrary to the misconception held by
some Grinnell students, the Younker
Memorial Resource Center is not just a
dispensary for vitamin pills, aspirin. and
Band-Aids. In fact, according to Director
Donna Bailey. the tacility provides a
number of valuable services for the 50 to 75
students who fall victim to such
miscellaneous ailments as allergies. colds
and gastro-intestinal problems every
week. The center offers allergy shots,
pregnancy testing, medical consultations,
and gives reierrals to local doctors if a pro
blem is beyond their capabilities.

This year is the first for the Share Care
program where students are translerred
to Grinnell General Hopsital for overnight
stays, in the past, students could stay at
the health center. Nancy Suggs. Chariper-
son at the YMRC subcommittee. says this
was discontinued because of “liability
reasons" after lawyers advised them that
a Registered Nurse was required when
students spent the night at the Center.
Previously a student clerk with a
telephone hooksup to an RN. was on duty
during nights at the center. Mrs. Bailey
says that the main function of the YMRC
remains “to meet the health needs of the
students and to educate them about
wellness.”

Within the first two weeks oi the

semester, a student suiiering irom an un~
disclosed complaint chose the Share Care
option. However. both Suggs and Karen
Corr, Student Clerk Coordinator, concede
that some students are reticent about us-
ing the new service because of the distance
of GGH trom the campus, Corr emphasiz»
ed that Share Care is “a positive program
and students should use it in the same
manner they used the YMCA when it was
open for overnight stays." The cost of the
night in the hospital is covered by the stu-
dent health fee. Students who are fatigued.
stressed, or just wanting to get away from
this academic pressure keg. are encourag-
ed to take advantage oi the Share Care 0p-
tion. “Both the hospital and the YMCA
want Share Care to work and we need stu
dent evaluations to iron out any quirks

which might be present in the iirst year,"

said Suggs.

The all-senior student-sub-committee is
threatened with extinction next year
unless it attracts some new blood in the
form of Grinnell upperclassmen. Aside
irom functioning as a troubleshooting
device, the subcommittee provides cer-
tain student benefits. This winter, the sub-
committee plans to distribute information

downtown.

The Grinnell iamily had and continues to
have iniluential, even famous, men and
women working all over the United States.
During J.B. Grinnell‘s life, for example, it
was his relative Julius Sprey Grinnell who
prosecuted rioters in the Hay Market scan-
dal and won the controversial trial Closer
to home is J.l3.'s cousin's grandson, Grins
nell Dunham, a native oi Grinnell.
Dunham shares with Deminoil an ex-
cellent sense of history accompanied by a
clear perception oi the present. Mr.
Dunhamvhas lived in Grinnell almost his
entire liie. He received a degree in physics
from the college in 1930. and continues to
iarm outside oi Grinnell. He is closely tied
to the college in a social way; in his own
words, “he can't stay away” trim the
campus. Evidence oi this is his ap-
pearance in the “New Students” catalog.
He and his wiie Marjorie appreciate the
exceptional music and lectures me college
has to oiier. and he ieels the interaction

"uln sfullon son": of

with the young people is a “teach and
learn“ experience,

Seeing Grinnell from the viewpoint of
both a student and a long-time resident of
Grinnell, he believes the college
stimulates the town. However. he has also
noticed tensions between the students and
the native Grinnellians, For instance,
Grinnell residents pay higher taxes
because of the college without always see
ing the benefits. For the most part he sees
Grinnell as a cooperative and progressive
community.

Discovering the history oi dinnell is no
less inspiring than touring the City of
Brotherly Love. Grinnell Dunham and
many others will always be glad to enter-
tain questions about this historic town.
Deminoff‘s research should reach comple
tion by mid~1987. For entertainment. ior
relaxation, ior insight, taking a look back
at the story of Grinnell is truly a “Grinnell
experience"

Smith Quiet,
Not Dormant

By Karin Sedestrorn

“Squares,"

“Nerds,"

“A study dorm."

In high school, there were different
crowds and it was a very rare person who
could transcend the boundaries (pardon
my hackneyed phrase) and belong to more
than one crowd, I figured that at Grinnell,
we're all reasonably intelligent, we can
rise above the “crowd system" and the
labelling that goes with it, rightt Not
necessarily. Those same crowds and
labels exist here. The lines are just finer.

Quiet Hall is what I’m talking about.
(Thought I'd never get around to it, didn't
you?) The expressions appearing above in
quotes are some oi the descriptive, rather
mundane terms I've heard applied to Quiet
Hall and its residents,

15 there a stigma attached to living in
Quiet Hall?

On Saturday I sat in the room of a senior
on Smith Second, I thought she would be a
good person to interview for this story, and
the remark that made me think so was this
7 “In Quiet Hall, you have the highest
percentage oi kids that will study in their
rooms."

What about the other places on campus
that you can study in?

“The library is cold, the Forum is too
noisy. ARH is draity and when i study. 1
need absolute silence. l preier my room."

All right, In Quiet Hall nobody ever
plays their stereo loud or anything, so
that's no problem, right?

“(in the contrary. Kids here play their

stereos just as much as any other hall.
They are no less rowdy — We played ten-
nis and soccer in this hall. The difference
is that in Quiet Hall, I can tell someone to
close their door or shut up, and they will
close their door or shut up, and I won't
hear another word about it. That's why I'm
here.”

Has Smith always been Quiet Hall?

“No. Langan was Quiet Hall for so long
that when they moved it to Dibble, diey
had a ‘Goodbye Quiet Hall’ party. Dibble
was ‘quiet' for two years and now Smith
is."

Smith is bigger than Dibble, right?

“Yes, we have a pit and they don't "

Does that mean that there are more peo
ple interested in Quiet Hall’l

“Not necessarily. it just means that
there were iewer people interested in an
allvmale dorm than in Quiet Hall.”

At this point, a junior friend oi hers went
by the open door and the senior called her
in.

Neither of these two have always lived in
Quiet Hall; they've lived in “Regular"
dorms, too.

interestingly enough, the junior didn't
even remember that she was living in
Quiet Hall.

”I guess that ought to tell you
something." she laughed. Then she got
serious. “I like living here because you
don't have to worry about people invading
your private space,"

“Why did you decide to live in Quiet
Hall?” asked the senior.
