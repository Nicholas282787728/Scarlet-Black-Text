Candidate on Campus _ Police Wam Students

By Dave Jones

“The selection is really a question oi
whether we stay the course . . . or change
the course. 1 vote we change”, comments
David R. Nagle, the Democratic candidate
for the third district congressional seat,
who will speak in South Lounge this Tues-
day at 4:15 p.m.

The current representative. Republican
Cooper Evans, is retiring, causing an open
seat to be contested between Nagle and
Republican John McIntee.

Nagle has been very active in the Iowa
Caucus system. As a former chairman of
the Iowa Democratic Party, he feels that
the iowa Caucus, traditionally the first
caucus in the U.S., is important to Iowa
because it generates a great deal of
money. He also stresses that “In the con-
text of this election, it shows that someone
from a small town in Iowa can go to
Washington and get something ac-
complished,"

As for what it is that he would ac»
complish it elected, Nagle would like to
’help more larmers than are currently be-
ing assisted. He goes as tar as to say that
the 1985 Farm Act “ought to be thrown in
the trashcan." “I also question the amount
and matter oi spending on detense. My op-
ponent would vote i'or ireezing spending;

In a recentlyreleased study oi poverty in
Iowa it was revealed that 16 percent of the
population or Poweshiek County have in
comes below the poverty level Although
Poweshiek ranks 72nd out of the 99 coun-
ties in terms oi poverty, [or the 16 percent
laced with the dayrtonay economic hard-
ships, the problem cannot be
underestimated,

How do the impoverished survive".
There are numerous safety nets. The
following is a breakdown of the service of-
iered to the poor in Poweshiek County:

In Poweshiek County, 597 out of 19,000
families receive financial aid in the form
or cash through the Department of Human
Services. Aid is received by ISO other
families through programs for daycare,
the mentally retarded. and several others,

In Grinnell, a new program has been
termed to aid pregnant women .and
children, Currently, 21 families are receiv-
lan aid through this program.

Food stamps are received by in
iamilies. Thirteen oi'these iamilies include
iarmers who have been hard hit by the re-
cent farm crisis, The Department of
Human_ Services also provides budget

and other types or aid

Homecoming

Homecoming 86 will be new and improv-
ed dns year at Grinnell High. The
Homecoming Parade will move irom Fri»
day to Thursday night, October 2, to allow
more people to participate and enjoy the
lestivities. The Chamber of Commerce
and the Main Street project are helping to
organize this year’s parade, and are ask-
ing that anyone who wishes to particxpate
in this year’s parade call the Chamber of»
lice at 236-6555,

The iull Homecoming schedule will be
announced in the near iuture.

I’d cut it by $25-$50 billion. I wouldn't vote
for iurther production or deployment of
the MX missile, the B71 bomber, or Contra
Aid."

0n the recent suggestion that college
students receving government aid undergo
mandatory drug»testing, Nagle holds a
very iirm line. “1 do not iavor mandatory
drug-testing of any segment of our
society," he ﬂatly states.

Nagle iirst became interested in politics
in 1956, when he was twelve or thirteen. “I
was watching T.V. and Adlai Stevenson
was walking down some steps and so-
meone, a reporter, asked him how he ielt.
He said that he felt like a twelve year old —
too old to cry, too young to swear,” he ex-
plains. The grace that Stevenson showed
alter being defeated for President stuck
with Nagle and in 1960, he joined many
people his age in becoming active in John
F. Kennedy’s campaigns.

As for what he has to offer college
students it elected, Nagle says that he
wants to ensure that federal resources in
adequate amounts are available and to see
that students receive a quality education.
0n the international scene, he wants to see
steps taken to lessen tensions with the
Soviet Union,

A Lot

By Bruce Emond

Last Saturday‘s heavy thunderstorm
and the resulting ﬂooding oi several cam-
pus dormitories caused damage to lure
niture, carpeting and paintwork, accorr
ding to Dale Hone, Physical Plant Direc-
tor.

The most severely affected of the dorms
was Loose Hall. Hone said that flooding
was particularly extensive in Loose
because the Outside ramp acted as a darn
[or ﬂoodwater. Loose Hall Resident Ad-
.visor Barb Krantz said that students were
caught unaware by the storm and that
ﬂooding was rapid. “We watched the
water level in the basement rise from a
couple at inches to about a loot in just an
hour,” said Krantz, While there was no
damage to student rooms, Krantz said the
influx broke the glass in both entrance
doors and rendered the dorms washing
machines inoperative over the weekend.

James Hall was also hard hit. “There
were about two inches of water in the base»
ment but most oi us were up and able to get
our stuff out in time," said sophomore
Christopher Hollins, Hollins complained
that the basement’s carpet now “reeks”
and should be pulled up and replaced.

Water was cleared from the basements
by late Saturday alternoon but clean-up
operations such as the retouching oi paint-
work and the vacuuming oi carpets are
continuing. Once all cleanrup operations
are complete, an assesment oi the damage
and overtime pay ior B and G workers will
be made, but l-lonc expects these costs to
be “minor.”

”Most Grinnell students are city kids IIVV
ing in the middle oi the cornfields," says a
current college guide, and tor this reason,
Grinnell studenm tend to think that they
are living in a crime-free utopia. However,
Police Chief Jim Ahrens said, ”Just like
any other community, we have our percen-
tage oil nies." ,

In add on to Grinnell's own “percen-
tage of loonies," it is not uncommon for
people to drive irom as tar away as Des
Moines to windowpeek or steal irom dorm
rooms and loggias.

Although Grinnnell’s last reported
assault occurred about three years ago,
police stress that as hoaky as it may
sound, die buddy system is still a good
idea. After sundown, it is generally a good
idea to walk in groups oi about three or
four.,

Most negative confrontations that Grin-
nell students experience downtown are
merely verbal, but police advise that even
when there is no physical confrontation,
students should. “Ignore them and get out
oi the way," and police request that
license numbers and descriptions of 31036
involved be reported so that a criminal
trust pass can be issued to bar the alien-

ding person from campus.

Two years ago, a group of approximate—
ly five or six people repeatedly harassed
college students, and in one instance, a colr
lege student was injured. Due in part to
student reporm, one of the group is cur-
rently serving ten years for burglary.

Because the police department feels a
commitment to college students and
doesn‘t see any difference between so-
meone who lives in Grinnell twelve months
out oi the year and someone who lives here
nine months out oi the year, the depart-
ment has appointed Larry Busch as col»
lege liaison ofﬁcer.

Busch’s iunctions include helping
students deal with assorted problems —
irom paperwork to be iilled out iollowing
traffic accidents to attempted suicides.
Busch expressed his desire to enhance the
communication between students and the
police department and said, “Like they tell
you at school, there’s never a stupid ones
Lion,"

Currently, Iowa's changing drinking law
is making good communication between
student and police department imperative.
