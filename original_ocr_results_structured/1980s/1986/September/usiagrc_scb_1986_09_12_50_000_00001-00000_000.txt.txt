Grinnell College has been awarded a
$500,000 grant from the Pew Memorial
Trust to develop the ioreign language
studies program.

The grant will go toward making
“foreign language instruction and learn
ing a more central component of our curs
riculum here." Professor of Spanish Den-
nis Perri said. '

Perri was chair oi the planning commit-
tee that put together the grant proposal
and is currently chair oi the steering com-

~ mitt‘ee for implementing the grant.

A rough profile of the student body shows
ed that while 80 percent of all students take
a foreign language, only 6062 percent take
three or more semesters, which is the
usual course load required to gain some
competency in a language. .

Perri said that the first part of the grant
proposal requires “the [oreign language
departments at Grinnell to look closely at
.their rirst and second year programs.”

They would then “revise and or develop

their language courses “tn' improve
language instruction in order to improve
the retention rate, reach more students
who are not taking a language . , . and to
encourage those students who are taking a
language to complete enough at the
language to bring their competency up to
where they can use those skills,” he said.

The second part of the grant project en-
tails encouraging the use of a foreign
language in non-foreign language classes.

“That is, to encourage students in other

courses to use their competency by'

reading materials, doing projects, etc. in
the lorelgn language,” Perri explained.

”In order to do that a portion oi the grant
will be used for those professors and ms
structors who are interested to refresh
their own language skills, to Offer them
time and or iunds in order to perhaps
develop material," he said.

Perri cited the possibility of “plus-two
projects" — independent study course-

New Life for Main St.

By David Jones

As one of only live Iowa communities in-
volved in the recently announced “Main
Street” program. the iuture oi Grinneil
seems very bright.

“Main Street" is a program aimed at
pumping new life into the community
through eiiorts incihe areas of organizer
tion. promotion, design, and economic
restructuring. It involves the sixeblock
area bounded by Sixth Avenue, Broad
Street. Third Avenue, and West street.

Matt Hussman, Main Street Project
Manager and a 1980 graduate of Grinllell
College. teels that the program diiiers
greatly from national urban eenewal pro-
jects in that the Main street Wlll ask the
community what it wants done and then
will try to respond to those requests.

Hussman also stressed the importance
the college community will play as he will
appear irequently on campus to ask
students how they feel the downtown area
could be improved.

One oi the key ingredients to the project
is the “interest buy-down" plan, started in
April. Four community employers —
DeLong Sportswear, General Telephone oi

the Midwest, the Grinneil Mutual Rein»
surance Company, and Grinneil College 7
founded a $200,000 IOWrintereSt loan pool to
encourage downtown i provement.

Under this plan, qualified buyers will ar-
range ior loans from lending institutions at
the prevailing interest rate. The loan pool
participants will then “buyrdown” the in
terest rate by five percent ior live years
lessening the borrower's loan costs. The
maximum loan available to any single bor-
rower \vill be $25,000. .

Iowa Governor Terry Branstad seems to
feel the statewide program will have
positive results. He is quoted as saying the
program will create new jobs. increase
property values. attract private invest-
ment. spur retail sales. and improve the
communities overall economic base.

As ambitious as the Main Street pro
gram may be, Hussman is quick to warn
that the project is incremental and will
take time to evolve.

l-lussman said, “[it is] like a mushroom
e there'sa lot iloating around in the base»
ment that you can't see, but you'll soon see
something coming up.”

Diplomatic DOnation‘

By Jennifer Halcrow

George Kennan, a name recognized by
students of Mr. Meyer’s International
Relations class as the author of the ”Long
Telegram”, donated 30 volumes of works
by or about Anton Chekhov to Qrinnell this
August.

The original Petersburg edition of
Chekhov’s complete works, as well as six
volumes ot the author‘s letters to his sister
are included in Kennan’s donation.

Mr. Kennan collected these works in the
1920‘s and 1930’s while he was in El 3, the
capital oi Latvia, and in Moscow. ennan
was at that time a US. ambassador to the
Soviet Union. Kennan intended to write a
biography oi Chekhov with the volumes,
but never did.

pened, have been no iiner grounding in the
atmosphere or prerevolutionary Russia
than this great body of Chekhoviana, un-
paralleled as it was in perceptiveness,
Vivldness, objectivity, and artistic
feeling” (MEMOIRS, 19254963. Two vols.

The value of the Works is not determined
by the library; due to tax laws the collec-
tion must be evaluated by an independent
appraiser. according to Anne Kintner,
Associate Librarian and College Archivist.

All 30 volumes are in Russian, 14 of
which are by Chekhov himself and 16 are
about the author. The works are likely to
be used as a research source for faculty,
