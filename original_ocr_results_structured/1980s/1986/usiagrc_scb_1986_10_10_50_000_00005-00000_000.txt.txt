Way Out
in London

By Shelley Reid

idon’t suppose that the life I’ve describ-
ed so iar sounds nearly as exciting as most
people imagine lile in London to be. All oi
this cooking. cleaning. shopping, and queu-
ing v well. lace it. you can do that in Grin-
nell. and for a lot less money. Why use a
Way Out ii you just find yourseli in the
same situation irom which you were trying
to escape? Don't people in London do
anything for entertainment (besides read
the papers)? or COURSE they do, They go
to the theatre,

One of the nicest things about the
Grinnell-in-London program is that it’s not
just a Way Out. but also a Way In 7 to the
theatre. one play a week iree oi charge.
This is a nice gesture on the part of the peo»
ple who run Grinnellrianondon. consider-
ing that theatre Seats in London. even the
ones scrunched off to the several Walls and
hall a dozen ushers. are easily $15 apiece.

Theatre in London is a Big Deal. com-
pared to Grinnell productions — at leastas
lar as intermission is concerned. Instead
oi pouring out into the Fine Arts hallways
and queuing for the drinking iountain
(remember. there are no drinking loun-
tains.) the Crowd saunters out into the
theater’s reception area. which is usually
served by a full bar. a small restaurant
selling everything from peanuts to
strawberry tarts, and two or three ushers
selling “American-Style" ice cream. (Why
the English have not yet learned to make
their own ice cream. I don’t know. but even
Burger King serves better ice cream than
most London establishments.) Some
theatres even let you take a glass oi cider
back into the theatre to sip on during the
second half of the production. It’s no
wonder that the last scene of so many
plays get such rave reviews.

London is also a great place ior the
classical musichoVer; concerts are (re-
quent and oiten inexpensive. One of the
best deals in town is the annual series at
summer Promenade Concerts at the Royal
Albert Hall it you’re willing to queue ior
an hour and a half (there are always plen-
ty of vendors around who will try to sell
you “ice cream" if you’d like some while
you wait). you can get cheap tickets to the
Arena section of the hall. You don’t get a
Chair, or even a bench. but where else
could you attend a performance of a major
symphony orchestra in bluejeans. and
listen to Beethoven While stretched out on
the floor with your eyes closed?

If you have money enough. you could
dine out afterwards, for there are lots of
wonderful restaurants in London. But be
careful: in smaller towns outside oi Lon-
don. many reasonably-priced restaurants
tend to close early 7 as in 5:30 or 6:00. As
we wandered hungrily through the streets
of Dover one evening. we tried to imagine
any American restaurant that would close
its doors at 5 : 10 on a Saturday night just as
ravenous tourists were coming up the
street with money in_ﬂ'leir pockets. These
Brits are an interesting sort of Iolk. Not
always very bright. but interesting.

if you‘re short on funds, you can always
get fish and chips and listen to the radio in-
stead. This is again a predictably pleasant
evening {or the Classical music lover . , .
anybody else should bring their Walkman
and an ample supply oi cassettes. British
radio is not like American radio. Since
they have iewer stations, they make up lor
it by increasing the variety on each sta-
tion. To people who are annoyed at the
solid Top-do programming at many or the
stations available in Grinnell. the chance
to hear something besides Madonna and
Lionel Richie may seem like a very good

However. the British stations overdo it
just a bit. If you are a Phil Collins fan, for
instance,,and by some miracle turn on the

Collins song, you may be dismayed when‘
the next song is one by Ricky skaggs. it
you are a Skaggs ians, don‘t hold your
breath. the lollowing song is just as likely
to be ultrarreggae as anything else. And it
you are a Bruce Springsteen or Cat
Stevens fan. you might as well go home.
At least the movies playing in London
are more familiar. Feeling visually
deprived (we have no TV). a [riend and I
caved in the other day and went to see
BACK TO THE FUTURE again. But even
this wasn’t safe. First were the previews of

 

 

' coming attractions. most oi which are old

enough to have even made it to Grinnell
once or twice. At the end of the previews
was a public service announcement about
the plight of blind people. and how we
should Give Generously to the Foundation
for the Blind When that was done, they
closed the curtains and turned up the
lights, and a crew oi elderly ladies came
around collecting lor the Foundation. It
was effective, we decided, but Extremely
tacky, Finally they dimmed the lights
again. opened the curtains, and put up iii-
teen minutes of advertisements for
everything irom styling mousse to bank
accounts. When they closed the curtain
once more and turned on the lights, 1
began to despair oi EVER seeing Michael
J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Nearly thirv
ty minutes alter the movie was scheduled
to start. just as we finished the last
kernels oi our popcorn. they turned down
the lights for the third time, and started
the movie we had come to see.

It‘s an interesting paradox. the British
ToprtiD radio shows are in such a hurry to
get through that they only play halt the
songs on the list (always, of course. skipp»
ing the ones you were waiting for). while
the movie theatres are willing to schedule
an extra hali»hour per show to get in their
previews and ads.

Idon’t know if there is an explanation for
this; perhaps may do it to ilush out the
Americans in the crowd who. although
pretending to be native Londoners, iinally
leave in exasperation. Perhaps it's just the
natural chaos that takes over in a country
without a written constitution. Either way.
it’s still a lot more entertaining than scrub-
bing a bathtub — for whatever that’s
worth,
