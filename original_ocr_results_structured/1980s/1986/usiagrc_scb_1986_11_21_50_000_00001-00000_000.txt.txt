Domestic Violence
in Grinnell

by Todd Francis

It wasn't until she saw her husband pick
up one oi their two daughters by the ankle.
place her head between his knees. and beat
her up and down her legs and back that the
woman finally realized her husband was a
severe threat to her and to her daughter.

Soon after her daughter's beating, she
was in an accident. when the damage pay
ment came, she took it and [led with the
children from the farm on which she had
lived for eigtitsand-a-half years,

The Woman who described this crisis
was part ol the panel that met to discuss
the causes and possible solutions of
domestic violence on Wednesday,
November 12. The discussion, sponsored
by the local chapter of the National
Organization of Women. also included
Grinnell Police Chief Jim Ahrens, Linda
Knierim of the Mental Health Center, and
Linda Taylor. director of Domestic
violence Alternatives education and sup-
port programs.

Domestic violence. like that in this
woman‘s life. is not a rare occurrence in
the United States or even in Grinnell,
Iowa. However. the problem of domestic
violence has been largely ignored in the
past. partly because it was not considered
to be a serious problem for a long time.
panel discussants said. Furthermore.
domestic violence is often a “secret.”
discussed neither in the households where
it takes place nor with outside authorities.

Taylor described domestic violence as

an “overwhelming problem” in Grinnell
as well as in the rest oi the nation.

In order to help treat this problem,
Domestic Violence Alternatives was
established in 1983. DVA operates its
24~hour crisis lines in Marshall. Tama and
Poweshiek counties.

The organization has trained
volunteers to talk to women undergoing
abuse problems as well as volunteers who
will shelter women and children in their
homes for up to seven days,

Ahrens describes Grinnell's approach to
domestic violence as a very successful
venture. Working with DVA and expanr
ding police understanding oi domestic
violence as a problem has yielded progress
during the last three to four years.
However, Ahrens maintains that further
improvements are needed. He especially
pointed out that men need to become more
involved in the issue of domestic violence.
Rather than accepting such behavior in
their peers. they should condemn it.

One or the main causes emphasized by
both Ahrens and Knierim, a social worker
at the Mental Health Center, is the tradi
tional role of women in society, Even to-
day. Ahrens said. many women learn irom
their religion or lrorn society that women
should hold subservient roles in relation to
men. Physical and psychological abuse
are accepted by many oi these women as
natural.

Domestic violence usually occurs in
families where one or both spouses were
abused as children. Not only do abused
people oiten in turn abuse their spouses or

Letter Apologizes for
Homophobic Acts

by John Harrison

This WeekI Tom Crady. Assistant Dean
oi Student Affairs received an anonymous
letter which apologized tor the “oIfensive
homophobic acts” which the anonymous
writer claimed to be in part responsible
for.

The letter was given to the Scarlet and
Black by Dean of Students Jim Tederman
who said the college was still pursuing the
person or persons who were responsible
for the homophobic acts. Tederman said,
“This letter does not dismiss the facts of
what has been done.”

Beth Johnson, one of the recipients of the
homophobia mailings. said “The
personls) did not send the letter to me;
they had my address, they could have sent
it." Johnson stressed. “I'm the one they
should have been apologizing to . . . they
abused my rights."

Rd. Baker, another recipient of the
homophobic mailing. said that. “the per
son writing this letter is trying to save his
own ass," Baker wondered why, if the per-
son was really sincere, did he not send it to
the people he offended,

According to ,Tederman. the college had
not made much progress in the investiga
tion. However. individuals close to the
matter indicate that the Office of Student
Atlairs is close to iinding the perpetrators.
Sources say that the administration has an
individual identified and are waiting to col-
Iect evidence before pressing formal
charges,

The Letter:

I would like to apologize for the
offensive homophobic acts (at
least the portion that I was
responsible for) on the campus.

Anything I said relating to
violence towards homosexuals
should NOT be taken seriously. I
never intended to hurt anyone. I
was merely expressing my at»
titude toward gays in a sarcastic
manner that was taken way too
seriously, Though you may think
of me as an “ignorant jock,” I do
have a moral basis for my at-
titude. All I was worried about
was the effect gays might have on
the American family. Obviously, I
expressed my views in the wrong
way.

I would like to remain a
member of this campus, and I
now promise to discontinue any
kind of homophobic activities.
There is no radical right wing
group. I respect all rights for

Farm Crisis:
What Can Be Done

by Kristen Stromberg

Charles Francis. proiessor oi agronomy
at the University of Nebraska, visited
Grinnell this week to speak at a forum on
the growing crisis in agriculture,

The forum, which was jointly sponsored
by the Rosenfield program and Grinnell
2000. included a lecture on “Sustainable
Farming Systems in the Midwest." and a
lecture on “Resource Efficient Farming
Systems for the Developing World "

According to Francis. the current tarm
policy is an almost complete iailure, The
government programs have not helped to
solve the problem or “huge volume, low
value larming."

In order to stabilize prices. agriculture
must be “moved away from its current
dependency on federal subsidies," he said.

One problem with the current iarm
policy is“fronts" lor huge corporate farms
ing systems, enabling large tarms to
receive federal funds. A farmer with 5,000
acres. for example. might divide the land‘
into several chunks. with various partners
ships and divisions. thereby still qualiiying
for huge government grants intended {or
the struggling smallrscale farmer,

“That's not all bad." Commented Frans
cis "That's why we have cheap iood; we
pay less as consumers,"

However. the apportionment of the
wealth is unrealistic. it these policies are
to help inrniers stay in business “More
money is going to processors. brokers. and
wholesalers, this money should be
relegated to farmers and producers "

Some agricultural experts believe that
federal aid and programs should be cut
drastically in order to ”weed out" farmers
who are not successful enough, While

change in a society is always a sorting out
process, this ”survival of the fittest"
policy strikes some people as too severe.

“Initially, because of the environmental
issues and the enormous cost of
agriculture programs, there Will be a
backlash against agriculture until people
are helped to realize how important
agriculture is to our total economy,” he
said.

He feels this “backlash" will continue
until more rationar programs are
developed that really help keep iarmers in
business,

Farmers themselves must make difs
licult adjustments in their methods in
order to ensure the survival of small-Scale
agriculture, Francis said. He suggested
such steps as diversification of 'products
and part-time farming, Farmers growing
specialty crops and organic ioods are
usually very successful, while other
cooperating in small agricultural-based ins
dustries lessen their dependence on crop
raising, .

Current farm crises have not been an en-
couragement for students to take up
agriculture as a career. and the number oi
students of agriculture has been decreats-
mg steadily for the past few years. It is
predicted that there will be a defied of pet»
pic in agricultural employment wihtin iive
years Although only 2 percent oi the
population ivorks in handsron iarmiiig. H
percent oi the population works in
agriculture related-industry such as
research, sales. and chemical control,
