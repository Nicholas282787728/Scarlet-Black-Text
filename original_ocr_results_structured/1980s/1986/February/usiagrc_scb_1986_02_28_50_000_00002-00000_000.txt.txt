The American media has presented a
basically accurate but simplistic picture of
current events in the Philippines, accorr
ding to a Filipino political activist
visiting campus Tuesday.

Fransisco Lara,Eo-director oi the Pea-
sant Movement oi the Philippines, is in the
United States seeking support irom
American farmers for his own agricultural ‘
coalition. He began his presentation before
reports o[ Filipino strongman Ferdinand
Marcos' resignation were in general cir-
culation, and was.consequently unaware
that opposition candidate Corazon Aquino
was taking power as he spoke

Commenting on American news
coverage of the recent Filipino presiden-
tial election, Lara said. “What has been
projected in the media has been basically
a struggle between individuals, with Mr,
Marcos personiiying evil and Mrs. Aquino
personitvlng good."

sciences together in one central location,
While the math department had not faced
the numerous architectural problems of
the psychology department, the decision to
move into a new building was “very
welcome” according to one member of the
department.

With plans calling tor the top ﬂoor or the
building to be occupied by the math
department, and the bottom floor and
basement by the psychology department,
the opportunity to oiier a wider range oi
classes lor students with greater computer
facilities was a major iactor in promoting
the move. Professor Duke stated that the

while he agreed with that assessment oi
Marcos, Lara said. “So tar as Mrs. Aquino
is concerned, there are a lot at issues
which unite us, but also a lot oi issues
which divide us.”

He praised Aquino ior her vocal ad-
vocacy oi human rights, but criticized her
ior indeiinite stands on other issues, He
pointed out that she had said little about
land distribution or retorm, saying, “No
actual position has been taken on this."

Land reform is an issue of great impoi»
tance to the Philippines, where a small
group or wealthy landowners control most
oi the arable land in the islands, Much oi
the population works that land as poorly
paid tenant iarmcrs.

Lara also took issue with Aqulnu’s pro~
claimed willingness to renegotiate the
leases on the two large U.S. bases in the

naval base at Subic Bay are the two
largest American military installations

room and a computer equipped classroom.

The question of what will be done with
empty classroom space in both ARH and
Goodnow is one that has not been leit com-
pletely open. A renovation committee
headed by Beryl Wellborn, is exploring
various possibilities, including turning
Goodnow into an art gallery [or the Cam»
pus, or seminar rooms for upper level
classes in various disciplines,

The renovation of Goodnow is con
sidered one part oi a long range plan which
will include the renovation of Steiner and
ARH. For the number of alums that
wander back onto the campus pasta
renovation, the question of the future
might well be “Where is everything?"

Outside of the continental United States,
“What happened after the election il-
lustrates the point we were trying to raise:
that even though in the actual tally of
voters, Cory Aquino did win, Marcos
wouldn’t step down and we needed other
terms oi action to pressure President Mar-
cos to leave the country," he said.

Lara expressed particular concern over
the role 01- the military in the transition
from Marcos to Aquino Though a confronr
tation he ieared between troops loyal to
Marcos in the provinces and rebel iorces in
Manila never materialized. the military’s
role in the new government was oi great
concern to him,

He pointed out that the two leaders oi the
recent rebellion in the Filipino armed
iorces were longstanding Marcos
adherents. He also noted that the com-
mander or one oi the rebel strongholds is a
notorious torturer who appeared at the

'minur option needs to be a creative alter
native to the double major and the inter-
disciplinary concentration.

After the failure of the “first generation
minor" proposal, a modiiied proposal was
submitted last Semester, which was a com»
promise between faculty and student
desires. A version oi a departmental con-
centration. this “second generation
minor" strongly advised, that the student
take his/her “minor" in a division outside
the major division, The sequence or
courses tor the minor, totaling approx
imately 24 credits, would be {or the most
part dictated to the student. This, of
course, did not appeal to those students
who voiced their opinions on the matter,

The Curriculum Council opposed the
proposal on the grounds that this sequence
would be too rigid and restrictive. Faculty
did not like the proposal either, ior reasons
similar to why they didn't like the first pro-
posal, i.e,. most of the departments wbuld
have ditiiculty setting up a meaningiul
minor structure. In addition, some depart-
ments would have a hard time supporting
the influx of students into their classes
These departments, such as Anthropology.
do not graduate many major students, but
the number oi’ students wishing to be An-
thropology minors would be signiiicant.

Out of the ashes of this proposal, the
“third generation minor" arises, Welch
calls this the “independent inter~
disciplinary concentration“, essentially, it
is a reduced version of the intern
disciplinary concentration

For this generation oi the minor, the
burden oi responsibility would rest with
the student. The Student would have to
show his/her interest in receiving official
recognition ior work done by developing
and proposing a planned “minor”, or iield

“We are sad to Say that with events that
are turning out right now. we see no im

occur," he said.

“What we would like tobring to you,” he
said, "Is that what your media has pore
trayed and what your State Department
has portrayed . . . is very unrealistic so tar
as we perceive the situation in the country
today. A lot oi the basic issues which the
people have put iorward have not yet been
addressed.

“With Cory Aquino supporting the
military and Ramos [leader oi the

sor and to the Dean oi Faculty, the student
could then proceed with his/her s ecific
area of minor study. » .

This plan is ditierent from the prlglnal
minor proposal in two crucial details]
First. the concentration minor would be in
a speciiic iield oi study, but would not be
limiting to the idea of the broadly-based
liberal arts education because it would
consist oi only 22-26 credits, and would cone
sist 0[ courses taken in two or more dep t-
ments ' ‘7 “‘“'

Second, the proposed minor would’be'
granted only alter the student took die in
itiative to plan it out, and demonstrated
his/her interest in studying a subject in
some depth outside of the major. For
demonstrating this initiative, the student
would receive formal college recognition
for work done, although not as a “minor!"

Welch hopes this proposal will satisiy
the desires of both students and faculty.
Last Tuesday night, the Curriculum Coun
on approved that Welch‘s proposal be sent
on to the Curriculum Committee. Dean
Catherine Frazer was optimistic about the
proposal, and thinks it is worthy oi serious
consideraton by the Currlculum Commitr

in the meanwhile, students who are a x-

tive interest in the subject now, according
to Welch, the Curriculum Committee is

seriously and thus is more likely to accepl
