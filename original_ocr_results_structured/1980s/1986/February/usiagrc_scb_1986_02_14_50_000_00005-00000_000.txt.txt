In My Opinion

Susan [Simon

1 am writing this article jointly With my
dad, although he is unaware of it. Until I
read the Feb. 7 issue of the S & B, the
thought of writing an article about the
space shuttle disaster never crossed my
mind. I felt that ﬁle matter had received
enough publicity, and l for one was beginn-
ing to be weary of it all.

However, an-article in the last issue in-
spiredme, and I feel compelled to express
my. and my father’s, feelings about the
situation. At this point most of you are
thinking, “Why does this girl want to ex-
press her old man‘s views 7 don't her own
suffice?" Well, my situation is somewhat
unique, for my father will someday be tak-
ing the risk these last astronauts did; thus,
my concrn about the explosion probably
runs deeper than most of yours.

I’ve found my views to be different than
most people expect them to be, but i feel
they are more rational than the average. I
have heard people say that no more
humans should be sent into space; I have
also heard folks say that the entire shuttle
program should be done away with; They
feel that the cost of production and the
risks involved are too high. One needs to
look at NASA’s track record; since it first
began sending men into space in the mid
1960's, only 10 fatalities have resulted. Yet
look at what has been accomplished, and
look at the benefits mankind has reaped.

As for cost, I wonder how many people
have bothered to compare NASA’s budget
with that of Reagan's military/defense
spending. NASA spends a mere fraction of
what Ronnie does, yet I fail to see how his
defense spending has benefited anyone.

A few days after the explosion, I receiv-
ed a letter from my father. He stated that
the crash was devasting. but that,... “we
must try to keep things in perspective. The
same day, two construction workers were
killed building a hotel in El Past). The next
day 21 people were killed in a Mexican
plane crash. Last week 13 people died in a
freeway crash in the fog in Pennsylvania.
And none of those tragedies got any
publicity. and none of those people were
looking for excitement, fame, or glory.
That’s more tragic in my eyes."

A couple of days ago i got another letter
from him; he enclosed two articles about
the horrible, inhumane manner in which

the Ethiopian government is treating hun-
dreds of thousands of its poor. Peasants
are being relocated into death camps (the
term “death camps” is my own, yet the
term is self-explanatory). with no warnr
ing, the militia comes to villages and ar»
rests as many people as it can get a hold of.
To prevent resistance, these people are put
on “hunger diets" - as if they really need
them, They are also physically punished.

if the poor do not die enroute to camps,
they stand a good chance of facing
death soon alter they arrive. Sanitary con-
ditions are abominable, the sick and the
healthy are kept together, fires break out
frequently. and if they get up later than 3
a .m,, they can forget having their grain for
breakfast.

The water that is available is only given
to the people in extremely small quan-
titles; the rest is used to wash the planes
between transportations, and also to wash
the soldiers uniforms. The peasants are
neither allowed to bathe nor to wash their
clothes. Their sleeping conditions are so
tight that they are forced to sleep on their
shoulders and have no room to turn over.

Other horrors occur all the time, but I
don’t care to elaborate further. I will only
repeat that this is GOVERNMENT
ORGANIZED MURDER we‘re looking at,
deaths that would not have been possible
without the “aid” of Western famine
relief, These atrocities have been known
for a year now, yet thewdsterners who
have been aware of them have hardly
listened, let alone reacted. A holocaust is
going on at this very moment. yet i wonder
how many Americans grieve at this
disaster. Furthermore, while I have
chosen Ethiopia to elaborate upon, similar
incidences can be cited around the globe.
But we Americans 7 how concerned are
we?

Well, I seem to have deviated from my
original topic somewhat. As for the space
shuttle crisis, I hope I haven't come across
as callous and uncaring. The grief that
Americans shared was natural and
understandable. I only find it ironic, and
very disheartening, that we grieved over
the death of those seven astronauts like we
did, yet we totally close our eyes and ears
to much larger tragedies. That, to me, is
itself a tragedy.

Letters to the Editor:

To the Editor:

About a week ago I wrote a letter to a
couple of the Trustees; in it I described the
various efforts the students here are mak
ing to help end the racist system of apar-
theid.

I told them that we were preparing to
boycott products made by companies
which benefit from apartheid, and l urged
them to accept our divestment recommen-
dations.

I wanted to let them know that students
here care about the troubles of the South
African peoples, so i described how the ln-
ternational Student Organization has
dedicated much of its fund raising efforts
to the South African Scholarship rogram.

[still had to demonstrate thatt ere was
wide spread support for these issues, After
all, last spring, over 200 studenb formed a
silent vigil outside the Trustees‘ meeting,
Thursday night, Feb. am over 200 students
put their money where their mouths are by
putting their mouths where the spaghetti
was (Thanks Ethan), Over 200 students
and faculty members paid their four
dollars to wait in long lines for food that
was not a whole lot better than the dining

halls.

We demonstrated that there is still
strong support for change in South Africa;
more importantly, we raised over $700 00
for the South African Scholarship fund.
SEA would like to thank all of those people
who made this semester’s first fund raiser
a success.

Now we onl need to make about another
311.000 00 to und one scholarship for one
year. If we reach this goal the College will
fund one or even two more scholarships.
This will only happen if we work hard, and
work together to show that we really do
care. Phil Cantor

Now for the “censorship" story from the
reporter's viewpoint. Last week's editorial
presented some valid points, But there are
three crucial points I would like to add.

First. it must be said that when the pro
lessor gave me the interview, it was with
the stipulation that he/she could read me
article before its publication. I agreed to
this, made the interview, and then called
the features editor. She said to give her a
copy (on Tuesday) and [the professor] a
copy and ii any changes were to be made,

The Human Element

Childhood memories.

Some say that the life of a child is
carefree and bright, that memories of the
joyous past are warm and innocent. Some
remember the vague tings: the clear ring
of young. unrestrained laughter during a
twilight game of hide-n'-seek; the hynotiz-
ing swoop and bob of a distant kite caught
in a rising wait of springtime breeze: the
sloppy wet kiss of a sometimes over
affectionate but widerlapped grandma...

Others remember the details: the very
first time climbing to the topmost bran»
ches of the twisted, gnarled oak tree grow-
ing but over Spring Creek; the much
celebrated pizza party out at Shakcy's on
the eighth birthday of a plgtailed older
sister; the mid-July hike with Dad up to
Blue Lake being snowed out. resulting in
the night spent curled up cozily in the from
seat of the '65 Rambler and followed by hot
French toast in the morning at Rustic.

Vivid memories,

street formations of two-story. typical

they crept forward. -

A kerosene lamp burned in the kitchen at
the rear of the house and all manner of
moths, millers. and ﬂitting fireﬂies darted
and buzzed in a frenzy beneath the
yellowish cascade of light streaming from
the window. One of the boys in the group
saw the light, hissed sharply. and pointed.
They froze, barely distinguishable in the
darkness. No activity, They tiploed
froward. All were silent now.

One swung the latch on the door quietly
into place and rejoined the others at the
right side of the tall, box-like structure. All
hands rested flush against the wooden
planking.

The signal to push.

lt rocked slightly.

Push again.

The rocking became a sort of rhymmic
motion, building. Arms. legs, and lungs
strained, united as a single destructive
force. They were as one, with a single goal,
a single purpose.

To push Widow McCreedy's outnouse
over.

It seesawed. The boys did not coax, perr
suade. tempt or lure the outhouse to lie

simultaneous pressure from a dozen
arms and legs demanded the inevitable
submission of the outdoor john, and the
combined force of a determined few
pranksters was one which would not be
placated or denied,

It teetered. The black hole underneath
gaped and the stomachrwrenching smell
of lime and feces rose in the boys' faces,
Muscles tensed. feel dug in, and the
wooden construction rocked one last time.

Whump. No louder than that, It was the
next sound. however. that chilled the fiery
beating blood of the triumphant young
hooligans. An old woman’s voice, battered
into silence by a powerful fist called fear. \
broke the iron hold and rang out. It was a _
biting curse of pure power and passion that
blasted the boys senseless. It was a howl of
rage. shock. and icy itensity.

With mangled nerves, the boys fled
yowllng into the moonlit darkness in all
directions. like skittish cats suddenly
taken unawares by the harsh bark of a
hound The howling continued, and the
night hungrily swallowed the shadows.

The town has changed since then, but
some of those boys still live there, now
grown men with houses. jobs, and families
of their own. Though they eventually
forgot the scare and pulled more pranks.
they were not with the same reckless [eel-
ing of invincibility, the same courageous
vagarant disregard for authority. My
grandfather seems to almost become
misty-eyes when he remembers how easy
it was to have fun when he was a boy.
When he recalled in detail and described to
me his memories of that unforgettable,
terrorrfilled night. what was truly in
teresting was not the power he felt in
pushing Widow McCreedy’s outhouse over,
not the heartrseizing shock he felt from
hearing her surprisingly loud scream. It
was instead, the numbing realization that
her shriek,

Had come from inside the Outhouse.

she would make them later.

I completed the article on Tuesday and
gave the professor a copy Wednesday
afternoon. So the whole issue was accenr
tuated by an ominous time limit, consider-
ing layout for the S and B is done on Thurs
day. ‘

Wednesday night the professor Called
me and asked to discuss the article. I set
up an appointment with him/her for’
Thursday morning and men promptly
alerted the features editor.

There were some word changes desired
which could be seen as sensitive, as he/she
admitted. But he/she also made a crucial
and well-substantiated point. Although
each sentence may have been true in and
of itself, the organization, diction and
grammar was such that it could have led
to some grave misinterpretations, This is
when the professor also asked not to have
his/her name mentioned, Considering the
pOSSlble miscommunicaticn involved, I
couldn't blame him/her,

I respect the views and actions of the
feature editor and the editor-inrchief. And
'perhaps changing words was a form ol

censorship, But i asked myself that fateful
Thursday: “If free press involves freedom
to misconstrue information, is it really any
better than censorship? Would you rather
be misinformed or uninformed?” e Beth
