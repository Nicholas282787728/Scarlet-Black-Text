Improvise your
Saturdays

by Beth Caldwell

. For some, it is a unique way to wake up
on Saturday mornings. For others, it
heightens awareness 7 of the space, the
group, and oneself. And for still others. it is
an enjoyable vent for creativity.

The scene: more than twenty Grin~
nellians playing improvisational theatre
games led by vivacious and confident
directors, Nic Glass and Jessica Thebus,
Every Saturday at 10:00 AM. in the Fine
Arts building, Thebus and Glass directed
interested students in theatre games and
basic improvisation.

Some seem to think the improvisation
workshop is only for experienced, rull~time
members, According to Thebus and Glass,
anyone. and everyone is welcome to par-
ticipate as otten as they wish. others
believe that Second City is the model for
this workshop. In actuality, Thebus and
Glass hope to see a core group evolve from
the workshop that might perform imr
provisational theatre, but the Saturday
workshops are not directed toward that
goal, They cater more to fun. a ieeling ol
ensemble, awareness. and basic introduc-
tion to improvisation and theatre games.

As Glass put it. this type or workshop‘
“involves spontaneity, risk. Surprise,
teamwork. trust, and quick responses "

Thebus has been exposed to theatre most
other life, Her mother is an actress and
drama instructor. She began acting in Iran
when she was eight. When she returned to
the U.S., she began improvisation work at
the Piven Theatre Workshop in Evanston.
Illinois.

Piven wasn‘t originally arranged for
those seriously pursuing careers in

theatres. However, since Aidan Quinn and
John Cusack tClass, Sixteen Candles)
graduated trom there. Piven has become
more pre-prolessional, according to
Thebus

Now Thebus cordirects an intensive six
week all day summer program at Piven.

Glass was involved in theater in high
school, but it wasn't until lastsummer that
he became intensely interested in im-
provisational theater.

To gain his present coniidence with his
knowledge at improvisation. Glass researr
ched the subject e talking to people and
reading about it

What the “core group", consisting of
about ten people. will do depends upon the
people in it — their desires. experience.
and competence,

“The small group will be like a sport".
according to Class, in that it will meet
irom 4:30-6:00 each day. He hopes such
rehearsals will begin after orestes finish-
ed production.

Glass would like to see this core group
periorm in Grinnell hospitals and schools,
turther enhancing town and gown rela-
tions.

Thebus views the group as a good com-
plement to the courses oliered by the Grin-
nell Theater Department. ”Acting can
seem like just learning lines and respon-
ding to a director. but in groups like diis,
you can ﬁnd theater for yourself and in
yourself." Thebus said.

Thebus and Glass are both contagiously
enthusiastic about. the group and
workshops They see great potential at
Grinnell and have high hopes tor the
future.

Year of the tiger

by May-lee Chai

The first day of the Chinese New Year
always ialls sometime between January 21
and February 19 on the date of the first
new moon alter the sun has entered
Aquarius.

By the Chinese lunar calendar Sunday
marks the debut of year 4684, the Year at
the Tiger,

Whereas Americans celebrate New
Year’s Eve with drinking parties, tradi-
tionally, the Chinese spend New Year's
Eve eating a big dinner with triends and
tamily The next day. one visits iriends,
giving gitts or money in red envelopes and
wishing all “Going xi ta cait (Goong she,
lah tsail)” which is Chinese Wish for a
happy new year.

Here at Grinnell, the international Stu-
dent Organization is sponsoring a Chinese
New Year Party this Friday, February 7.

which is open to the entire campus, will
have dancmg, Chinese almond and iortune
Cookies. and Chinese-style decor Also, the
Chinese department is plaimlng to
celebrate with a baozi tmeat dumpling]
dinner oft-campus on Saturday

The idea of the Year of the Tiger Comes
from the Chinese zodiac, According to
legend. Buddha once called all due animals
of the world to him. promising them a
reward Only twelve came. the rat, ox,
tiger. rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep,
monkey, cock, dog, and boor. in that order.
In return for their tealty, Buddha then

named a year after each oi them. That is
why the years run in cycles oi twelve.
Previous Years of the Tiger tell on 1974,
1962, 1950. 1938. and so on.

People born in the Year of the Tiger are
supposedly sensitive but short-tempered
and capable of great sympathy for people
they like. other people tend to respect
them but Tigerrpeople havc conflicts with
their elders and higher authority. They
also are given more credit than they
deserve Although they are courageous,
they can be selfish and mean Even so, it is
considered fortuitous it a man is born in
the Year oi the Tiger as tigers represent
the greatest terrestrial power in Asian
mythology. They are capable of protecting
life from the “three disasters”: thieves.
tire. and ghosts.

Tiger people should marry people born
in the Year ot the Horse, Dragon or Dog,
according to superstition.
