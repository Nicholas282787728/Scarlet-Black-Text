The Grinnell College Food Service
workers were olficially unionized on
March 13. 1985. but according to most peo
ple having to deal with the system. not
much has changed.

Although Food Service workers voted
17716 in favor of unionizing. only 13 out of
the present 34 workers are union
members. Iowa’s Right to Work law states
that even it your workplace is officiallly
unionized, you do not have actually to join
the union. However. when it comes to
policy. ALL the workers are treated accor-
ding to what the negotiated union contract
says.

Dave McConnell. Director of Dining Ser-
vices. feels that the presence of a union
hasn't drastically changed workers
management relations.»“but when we are
handling individual needs and requests.
we have to use the formalized structure of
the labor contract The contract minimizes
the latitude we can use to meet the needs of
individuals "Astor as the operating struo
ture goes. “the employees should and do
have a lirm understanding oi the con-

stlaints of a union contract ’ but no
significant changes have occurred.

Jackie Foster. a non»union cook at
Cowles. agrees With McConnell that there
hasn't been any real change except a shill
ting oi attitudes When you need a lavor.
people “still help you out. but there's a
feeling oi lt' s my job why should 1 help
you if i donthave to?‘ "

McConnell points out that the major dif-
leience since unionization is the salary
system. “We had a merit system beiore
they decided to unionize. but we don’t use
that anymore becauserwe have to pay the
workers according to what has been
ratiﬁed by the contract and that is it ”

Marjena Sloan. another non-union cook
at Cowles. remarked that “The union peo
ple are sortoicliquey it s not bad butyou
can feel it. ”

Tracy Bigbee. a union member. feels
that. ”The union’s helped me out. there's
not too much difference in the way things
arc The schedule goes by seniority now.
though. The union will help you out it so
meone's glvmg you trouble or harassing
you. that's a good thing about it."

mains so upbean“, revealed that while
virtually all ol those interviewed enjoy
Sheila’s positive attitude. most everybody
was at a loss to explain how she does it.

16% had no idea how she retains her

50% suggested that Sheila is probably a

Where Cookies
Come From

by Martin .I. Myszewski

Few would contest that bake shop is con-
sistently the best part oi rood service. The
ovens. the mixers. the pans and other im-
plements which sit in the basement of
Quad kitchen constitute the body of bake
shop. but Connie Van Ersvelde and Cindy
Haines are its life force,

Week alter week these women are
responsible for turning the quarter ton oi
flour. yeast. shortening and other ingre-
dients into all the baked goods [or Quad
and Coweles. the Forum. Grinnell House
and all catered events in past years they
had help in this huge task. but now they
alone can claim the credit for every
chocolate chip cookie. every blueberry
mullin. every donut. etc.

The day starts early in the bake shop.
Four days per week and alternate
weekends it’s “Time to make the donuts”
before some of us stagger home from par-
ties and others lrom the science library.
There is a lot of pressure to get everything
done on time and sometimes the human
element is lost in the shuffle Nevertheless,
