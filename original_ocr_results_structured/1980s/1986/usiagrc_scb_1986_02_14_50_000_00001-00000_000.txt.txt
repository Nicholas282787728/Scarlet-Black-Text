lie said “I belicve the minority aiiaiis

is an important part at the college' 5 strong

commitment to adversity"

‘ minority aiiairs oiiice to serve both black
and white students,

As an example. Jones oitered the Black

proiessionals to campus to teach a course
lasting a few weeks to a semester in
length,

program that utilizes Grinnell's black
students as recruitment representatives in
their hometown high schools.

Jones did describe some of the dif»
l'lculties he expects to encounter as minori~
ty affairs director.

One problem he sees is the student
body's lack of awareness of ciVIl rights.
Jones said. “Grinnell now has students
who were not born when Martin Luther
King Jr was assassinated in 1968 and
much oi the personal insight oi the
students on black civil rights is missing."

Jones expressed his commitment to im-
proving Civil rights awareness on
Grinnell's campus.

Regarding black recruitment, Jones
said his goal is icr 1091, oi the student body
to be comprised oi blacks. Currently,
blacks make up 5% of Grinnell‘s student
body.

Last Week the Board of Trustees
divested from MGM/United Artists and
thus began to selectively divest irom come
panies they iound not to be participating in
the active reform of the South African
government's policy or apartheid,

The Trustee's action is in compliance
with a resolution they passed in May oi last
year that called [or the Board of Trustees
to divest from companies that have failed
to Sign the Sullivan Accords or from com»
panies that provide “strategic or
technological.support tor the implementa-
tion of apartheid in the Republic oi South
Africa,”

Companies ill consideration ol diveste
ment were recommended to the Trustees
alter the Students to End Apartheid
researched the Trustees investement pot t-
iolio and iound three companies not to be
in compliance With the Trustee s May 1935
lcsolution

Those Companies were MGM/UA, Ford
Molol Company and Exxon.

The-Students to End Apartheid then took
their recommendations to the investors

Responsibility Committee which is
made up oi three trustees and two
students

The Trustees 0n the Investor Respon-
sibility Committee are Gardiner Dutton,
Andrew Lowey. and Fred Little,

The students were Phil Cantor and
Peggy MeKenna who are both members oi
Students to End Apartheid,

Drake said. “we must be consistent in
our expression or our opposition to apar-
theid” and he ordered the boycott as in
compliance to the Trustees directive to
retrain irom purchasing products oi
divested companies.

When asked when the boycott would be
lifted, Drake said as soon as MGM/UA
changes its policies in South Airica.

Drake also pointed out that MGM/UA is
being bought out by Turner Broadcasting
of Atlanta and the policies of MGM/UA
could change rapidly aiter the buyout and
quite possibly end the boycott in the near
future.

Phil Cantor, senior and member of
Students to End Apartheid Said of the
divestment and boycott, “the Trustea

knew it would be controversial and would .

piss the students oii...yet I believe the col-
lege is acting as a responsible consumer.”

Cantor said, “the point is to do
something about apartheid...and a boycott
is as good it' not better than divestment.”

Cantor stressed that with the boycott

“we will still have an excellent films pro-
gram. .the loss or MGM/UA is not that big
at a sacrifice. "

Mil-(e Cleary, senior and former member
or the South African Support Group, ex-
pressed his support oi the divestment and
boycott of MGM/UA.

Cleary said ”we [the studean] have an
opportunity to do something and we
shouldn’t blow it."

The investor Responsibility Committee
then held a telephone meeting in late
January to recommend that Board of
Trustees divest from MGM/UA.

The committee claimed that MGM/UA
had not signed the Sullivan Accords and
had given unsatisiactory responses to let-
ters requesting an explantion oi their in
volvement in South Africa.

The Board of Trustees met in Phoenix,
Arizona, on February 1st and decided to
divest from MGM/UA as in accordance
with the May 1935 divestment resolution.

The total dollar amount of divestment
from MGM/UA was $10300,

The Trustees decided to wait for more
inioi-mation beiorc taking action against
Ford and Exxon.

Furthermore, the Trustees asked that
the administration refrain from purchas-
ing the products and services oi MGM/UA
as in accordance with the May 1935 divest-
ment resolution which speciiically calls on
the college to boycott products from come
panies the Trustees have divested from.

President Drake disclosed that an over»
whelming majority of the Trustees were in
iavor oi divestment and boycott of
MGM/UA.

Drake said, “it is ironic that the first
company to be divested from is so close to
student life at Grinnell."

Yet, Drake believed that it is necessary
that students sacrifice something {or mak-
ing a statement against apartheid,

Clearly said that with divestment,
students ought to sacriﬁce something
along with the Trustees,

On the administration order to boycott.
Cleary said, "I have no problem with a
small group telling the college to boycott
when the students have publicly expressed
their support oi divestment."

Meg Takayan-la, sophomore, expressed
her agreement with the president’s direc~
tive to boycott by saying, “a boycott might
hurt...but we should support the
president,”

Yet David Bundy, freshman, said of the
boycott, “it's not very lntelligent...we’re
going to lose some good movies.” -

Bundy Said, ”the boycott is a matter of
total utility lost in not seeing MGM/UA
films versus the total utility gained by
makingastatementagainstMcM/UA and
i see the amount lost higher than anything
gained."

Bundy also expressed that the Trustees
have already made enough oi an eiiort by
divesting and there is no need to boycott.

Jeri Bloyer, treshman, expressed his
doubt with the whole principle of divest—
ment by saying ma blacks in South Airiea
are much better off than most blacks
throughout Africa and to divest would only
hurt their relatively high standard of liv»
ing
, Keri Hornbuckle, junior, expressed her
support lor the divestment yet she said,
“Students ought to decide to boycott, not
the administration. It should be the
students' gesture. If they decide to
boycott, great, it not, then the students will
be shown to be less committed than I
thought.”
