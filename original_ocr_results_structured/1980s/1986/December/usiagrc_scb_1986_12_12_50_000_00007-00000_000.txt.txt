Letter was wrong,

S&B coverage balanced

To the Editor:

My compliments to Alexander Rhoads.
he did something that is rare on this cam-
pus. IIe publically put iorth his ideas on a
topic, even though they were not
necessarily of the prevailing viewpoint.
My compliments also go out to John Hare
rison. despite widespread criticism he has
put out a quality paper that had in recent
years been lacking in credibility. Last
week Harrison published Alex’s letter, an
act he did not have to perform. [or as
editor-in-chiel it is his duty and privilege to
decide what gets published. This brings
me to my next point.

There is an old axiom that states. “Fools
rush in where angels tear to tread.” Well.
in my own admittedly limited knowledge I
have never heard anyone tell Mr. Rhoads
to go to heaven. so I do not think that he is
an angel. It is obvious that we have a
misunderstanding of both the system of
free press and the issue of homophobia. I
feel that the person who misunderstands is
not John Harrison or Beth Johnson or RJ
Baker. or even my own ignorant sell.

Point in fact: Harrison does not "almost
exclusively" quote RJ. and Beth on the

issue ol'homophobia. as Rhoads sug-.

gested. In recent weeks the following peo-
ple have been quoted on the subject 0! har-
rassment oi oiir Gay community' Art Jol-
ly, Jim Tederman. Julie Fraser. Tom
Crady. RJ. Baker. and Beth Johnson.
Many more people have written articles.

and even your letter. Mr. Rhoads, ap-
peared. The reason these people have their
ideas printed is that they are outspoken
and are important 'to the development oi
the issue. with the exception of Rhoads.

Point in fact: As was made clear in the
November 14 Scarlet and Black. Rd. and
Beth personally received threatening
homophobic mailings. 15 did some other
students. In my opinion they have every
right to demand a personal apology. I also
agree with R.J. that “the person writing
this letter (the apology) is trying to save
his own ass."

Point in tact: Beth and R.J. are but two
oi the people who iought for the establish-
ment of a Human Resource Center and a
Gay Resource Center. so the campus
would become aware of the issues ailec~
ting gay people. I find your questioning “if
Beth and R.J. are primarily concerned
about campus attitude toward
homophobia” insulting. and pose a counter
question: What has Alex Rhoads done for
Grinnell College lately?

In closing id like to apologize to the
campus community for further bringing
attention to the insulting narrow
mindedness that still testers on this cam-
pus. My motives tor writing this letter was

Outcry Editors Blasted

To the Editor.

I suppose this would be better addressed
to the Outcry. but they have only assembl-
ed enough conservative thought to till two
eightrpage issues this semester; conse-
quently. the chances oi publication are bets
tcr with the 5&3.

I see that the Outcry's Editors have once
again trotted out their old. tired
arguments against the abolition of
slavery. Oops. I mean their old. tired
arguments supporting homophobia. The
two look so much alike that I get them con-
tused.

Let's see. The Bible says that God
decreed that Blacks should be slaves and
that being gay isra sin. We have a moral
duty to provide simple. appropriate work
for Blacks to keep them out ol trouble and
to imprison gays who have sex to keep
their private lives from undermining the
American family. And. of course. it Blacks
were released into society their lazy.
shiltless natures would leave them unable

to survive; it we allow gays to be open in
society they will pervert all or our children
and try to gain converts.

Well. I’m Convinced. We blew it on the
slavery\ bit. so we better get the gays
belore they get us, Maybe a concentration
camp would be most appropriate. I hear
there is a nice piece of ground available in
a place called bitburg.

I trust the Outcry's readers noticed that
the editorial supporting homophobia ap
peared on the same page as a quotation by
Jesse Helms castigatlng the Soviet Union
for not valuing freedom. But perhaps I am
being unreasonable in expecting logic
lrom the Outcry.

Advocacy of the abolition of the Gay
Resource Center reminds me of the John
Birch Society Coloring Book's version of
the American Eagle The lclt wing has

been cut oil in me interest of the nation; ‘

unfortunately. the Eagle can only fly in
circles. 7 William Ii. Turner. '87

Pressure Seen as Beneficial

Dear Editor.

I would like to respond to Micky
Munley's December 5. 1986 “Quiet As A
Mouse” article concerning the “high em.
phasis on academics at Grinnell.“

I disagree that the rigorous demands put
on us as students is to the detriment of
learning to “function within a society that
most olten operates outside the sphere oi
academia." Some people may at lirst
socialize at the expense oi studying. while
others may study at the expense of
socializing. But sooner or later. either by
necessity or choice. the need to incor»
porate the other into our lives is tell. In
other words. we eventually either In-
tegrate our studying into our SOCIaliZing or
our socializing into our studying, In going
through this process of discovering a
balance. we are forced to make choices.

either between socializing and studying or
between studying more [or one class at the
expense of another. Because we are lorced
to make choices between studying and
socializing. as well as choices about the
amount of time to allocate to each course.
we learn to set priorities. One response
may be that the amount of academic work
should be decreased to a level that such
decisions need not be made so often. This
issue has in fact been considered by the ad
ministration An administrator told me
that he has asked alumni it they thought
the pressure had been too great and should
the administration talk to the protessors
about being less demanding. The response
of the alumni has been “No" to both The
alumni say that nothing since Grinnell has

There has been a campus- -wide eilort to
idlind and punish a student not lor any ac»

tions but only lor expressing his or her
gheliels. The campus justifiably tinds the
atibeliels disgusting, but that IS no excuse for

g; punishing the person involved {or using the

The only reasonable claim that one

might make against the person who sent
shthe letters is that s/he sent them
aganonymously. But this raises a question

7’52 why would s/he feel that it was necessary
to send them that way?

If the letter is veiwed rationally and
asunemotionally. it becomes evident that the

ms in very bad taste.

The campus community has also ex
pressed concern over the violent tone

alone in teelings ot violence towar

One only has to look at one or the letter
printed in one or last week‘s Des Molne '
Register to see that. That writer called to '
the quarantining ot all homosexuals AN
the suppression of all tolerant ideas i
public schools

So it is evident that in many parts of th
country writings that express toleranc
towards homosexuality are the writing
that would be suppressed without th
guarantee oi free speech

Furthermore if Grinnellians want t ,
have a right to speak ol tolerance orig
homosexuality and anti violence where their

Free speech is olten one oi the mos '

SGA Coverage Biased

Dear Editor

Regarding Sara Deichman's version ol
“SGA Briefs” thatappeared in the lastedi-
tion ol the s and B. I suggest that she be
less opinionated in her presentation of
what should be a summation ol the main
issues which occur each week at Joint
Board and that she should be more con-
cerned with the [acts

Ms. Deiehman maintains that the pro
posed initiative byrlaw would result in
“giving hail senators more power.” This is
purely conjecture aimed at persuading the
campus against the byrlaxv. .The job at a
hall senator is not to obtain power. and
anyone who feels that it is should not be a
hall senator posing under the guise cl
representing his constituents. A student
who does not trust a candidate to vote ac-
cording to the desires or the constituency

should not vote for that candidate. and il a
voter is irresponSibIe to select a represen-
tative who will not express his 'collsll-
tuents' views. then perhaps the voter
deserves to be misrepresented. However.
if a candidate misrepresents himsell at
election and constituents are later unhap-
py with their senator. that senator can be
removed from service

Referring to Ted Amanii‘s letter dellvuli'
cingrhomopliobia. Ms Deichman seems to
believe that ila senator does not hold a hall
meeting on an issue. he is not represellllli};
his constituency This belief is false and
sensational.

halls“ to obtain student input on the letter
