Jules iinti Jim llQGZt tells the Story ol’
two young in livmg in true Bohemian
style in pre-World War I Paris, They write
poetry by day and chase women by night.
Once they meet Kathe lileanne Moi‘eau),
though. both their lives change drastically.

Kathe is crazy. lunrlevlng. and
fascmating For kicks, she dresses up as a
hobo and draws a Charcoal moustache on
her iacc. Another time. she casually jumps
into the Seine while in full evening dress.
lust for fun Jules (Oskar Wernerl and Jim
(Henri Serrel both tall madly in love with
her Jules decides to marry Kathe, but
quickly discovers that. she is too willful and
spontaneous [or him to settle down with.
and so pawns her oil on Jim. pleading
“Love her. Marry her And let me see
her " Jim. like any good iriend. unsuspec-

tingiy agrees to this plan. but he too
discovers hiinscli in a "can't live with 'em.
can‘t live without 'em ‘ kind of relation
ship

.iutos and Jim isn't all luii and games.
though it is charming and sickening.
hilarious and depressing. innocent and
wise — all at the same time. it is. essenr
tially. a demonstration oi the contradic»
tions inherent in our lives. Directed by
Francois Truiiaut, Juice and Jim is one oi
the hetter lilmS that came out oi the
French school ot cinema. with excellent
periormances by all three actors. The
overall bubbly feeling oi this iilm over-
powers the somewhat gloomy ending, and
makes it well worth seeing,

1 * Bedazzled

Bedalﬂed (1967) is a modern take-0H on
the old Faust legend. written by and Starr
ing Dudley Moore and Peter Cook. In this
version. a mild-mannered shortrorder
cook tlvlooret in a London hamburger joint
sells his soul to the devil (Cook) and
receives in return seven wishes. Since the
cook |S lusting after one oi the waitresses.
who reiuses to respond to his advances. his
seven wishes naturally all pertain to his
pursuit oi the waitress tElenor Bron).
Equally naturally. each wish is in turn toil.
ed just at the last moment. usually by the
devil himseli.

Although the premise ior this movie
seems more than a tad trite, the actual
result is exceedingly funny. Cook and

Moore were two of the four original
members of the old British Comedy Show.
Beyond the Fringe. and they make a
wonderiul comedy team. Some oi the gags
less than successful and the film takes on
the aura of a skit that has gone on for too
long. but for the most part the interplay
between Moore and Cook is hysterical.
This ﬁlm provides a {unrlilled evening's
entertainment. with playful stabs at
British culture all along the way. Even
Mrs, Wholesome herself. Julie Andrews. is
not sacred. as her name is the magic
phrase used by the devil to make Wishes
come true.
