The

Human

By Jim Duncan

[didn’t even bother to dig my keys out of
my pocket, I pressed my eyeball up to the
miniature window oi my 1-20, Box and
muttered, “Yep, empty again.” Heck,
anymore it’s a thrill ior me just to get the
campus memo,

From the table on my way out i snagged
a steaming copy of the S&B, hot oil the
presses, 0n the way back to my room, I
snapped the paper open and scanned
headlines. My eyes settled on “From
Death Row," 3 letter to the editor supr
posedly written by an inmate at Arizona

State Prison in Florence, The letter re
quested that an ad for correspondence be
run, “I am twentysix years old without
family and would like correspondence with
anyone that has the time to write letters
and that would enjoy receiving letters
from me in return," the letter read, So on
and so forth.

It literally stopped me in my tracks. 1
read it through again and thought, “This
can't be rea1,i S gotta be a prank ” If so, it
was a joke in pretty poor taste

Justin was as interested as me in ﬁnding
out the truth. so he called down to the
Arizona prison to verify the man's ex-

istence. The letter turned out to be for real.

For days I turned it over in my mind. I
mean, I wasn‘t going to just whip-up a
iriendly “howya doin"l" ettcr and pop it
in the mail to be sent off to a fella not too
much older than me, a guy who had to’ve
committed a serious crime. His sentence
was DEATH ior cryin' out loudt I thought
about the two of us becoming regular core
respondents. What ii he was to be pardonr
ed by the governor someday get released,
and come look up his ”good buddy." Jim?
Pretty iarJetched, I know, but it's just the
sort of minor fear that might lurk at the
back of a person's mind for years.

I couldn't pass up the chance The idea of
contact with a convict intrigued me I've
lived a very sheltered life and have no ins
kling of . . . well, the darker side of human
nature.

I wrote my letter but have not received
a reply yet. I asked him about the super-
iicials 7 his living conditions. daily habits,
meals, I asked him what he did to get
where he was. I asked hiln about his past,
from his childhood on. Finally, I asked him
how his mind dealt with the circumstances
7 about waiting to be executed and all.
Maybe i made a mistake. Some of my
questions were penetrating and personal
I'm not sure I really wanl to know the
nnsn ers,

Now when I visit my P 0. Box, I'm sorta
uneasy it anything comes, I'll probably
hesitate before opening it up

Country x starts a war. Country v wins
it. Country v deploys its soldiers and
arsenals in Country X, Forty years after
the war has ended the soldiers of Country
Y are still in Country X. They live
segregated from the rest oi the nation on
bases that speak only the language oi
Country Y. They have become very dDml'
nant in the culture of Country X, but still
they claim that they are there to keep the
peace. In iact they want to keep the peace
so badly that they deploy their nuclear
weapons in County x “to keep Country 2
out! ” Need any more hints? _

West Germany is supposedly an in-
dependent nation, If this is the truth, well,
Alaska might as well be an independent
nation too. The standing joke in my Ger7
man hometown was that West Germany
would eventually become the 53rd state 7
right after Puerto Rico and Nicaragua!

As an American, living in the middle oi a
huge yet isolated nation, it is hard to
understand Why the Germans seem to
dislike the Americans. Most of them don't!
They just dislike all those trivial nuclear
rockets that are sprouting up like

t. dandelions over the countryside and those
arsenals where toxic gases and other
niceties are kept for use in the event of a
”Chemical invasion”.

West Germans on the whole do not
dislike the American people, just what
they are doing to the country. World War II
was over four decades ago. People here
have all but iorgotten it. In Germany,

every American 6.1. is a painiul and'

humiliating reminder. Every tank that
holds up traffic on the Autobahn is a
remembrance of the tanks that rumbled
through the villages over forty years ago.
Every harvest that is ruined because of the
annual training exercises is a memory of
the harvest iorty years ago. (There wasn‘t
any!) And every missile planted into the
soil is a reminder oi what could happen ii
someone gets an itchy linger,

Germans resent the fact that if there is a
nuclear war they’ll go iirst. West Germany

is the buffer between the East and the
West in Europe. That’s why Washington
thinks that it’s so important to keep the
peace there, When was the last time that
thev asked the German people it they
wanted that kind ot peace? Germany does
have its own armed torces. They may not
be as well equipped as their American bud
dies, but they are trained to do the same
thing. ‘ .

In America you hear and see the “whole
shocking story" every time that there is an
AntirU,S, demonstration in West Ger-
many Did you ever hear or see of opera-
tion “Weisse Rose” (White Rose)? Pros
bably not That was when German citizens
gave the American soldiers a white rose to
symbolize peace and iriendship between
the two nations. Peace and friendship . . .
not war and bombs.

Germans don’t hate Americans as much
as they hate their missiles, just like
Americans don’t hate Soviets as much as
they hate their government, After iorty
years of remembrance, of old soldiers that
still cry when they pass an old mineiield,
or of constant harassment from other na-
tions to keep up the War retribution
payments, Germany has had enough!
Think about it . . , how wouldjou feel?

Dear Editor,

Perhaps I should be pleased that there ex-
ists a potential activist on campus in the per7
son of Barbara Brown, but after reading her
lengthy column in which she lathered Ted
Amann and this mysterious entity Sophie with
vicious sarcasm and innuendo, I am more ins
clined to hope that she acquired a diiierent set
of ideas. Ii “Unstrung Knees" is a represen-
tative sample oi the manner in which Ms.
Brown calls attention to poverty, hunger or
thre threat of nuclear war, then the cause of
peace and plenty has better allies among
other folks, somehow, it never occurred to me

Unstrung Knees

By Barbara M, Brown

Ah, Parenls' Weekend! 7 that time
which comes but oncea yeart This lastedir
tion at that annual event certainly was unis
que, or so I have been trying to convince
my lather. In commemoration (or should i
say ”lamentation'l") of this year's

iestivities, I present the iollowing thoughts
ior your consideration:

The Weather. How many of you now are
iaced with the problem or convincing your
parents that the weather does not behave
in such an asinine manner all the time?"

Barbara Brown

“Why didn’t you TELL us Grinnell was
like this?” Ithought I heard one parent ad
monishing his student. At least now any
homesick ireshmen have a good, in»
credibly believable excuse if they wish to

convince their parents to let them leave-

this place.

Name Tags. Were your parents the ones
whom I saw who, so proud at their name
tags, “forgot" to remove them when they
went ouside the coniines oi the campus?
“Parent, Grinnell College,” they pron
claimed as they traipsed about the town,
the restaurant, the airport, the hotel . , . .

Name Tags tcnirtt. My father’s name
tag was emblazoned with 7 tgaspt 7 the
OLD Loco (ungasp), What could tllls
mean? Why would a college which pro-

-i‘esses to be so proud of its new identifica-

tion waste the opportunity oi showing it oil
to the parents? Surely Grinnell’s ad7
ministration would make no such gaff of
its own volition, Based upon this conclu-
sion, I can only assume that the man
claiming to be my father was an lmpostor
who planned his ruse last year, beiore
word of the logo change got out, I must in»
sist that each one oi you who received a
parental visit take particular care next
time you visit home. Try to ascertain that
your parents are indeed parents, You, too,
could be the victims of this most heinous

Quiet as

By Michael J, Municy
There is a lack or proper social space on
campus for the student body. I know, irom

conversations with various ade
rniinstrators, that this has been an area oi
concern tor quite some time. I have also
been led to believe that ARH, Steiner, and
Goodnow are scheduled tor renovation
betore anything will be done in regard to
providing adequate social space tor
students on campus.

Mickey Munley

One of my concerns is that the ARH
renovation will eliminate the auditorium
and consequently rob the campus oia vital
social space in the form of a movie theater
It has been suggested, since ARI-i will m7
eVitably be worked on during the school
year, that it might be necessary to acquire
the portable classrooms or some sort, Fur-
thermore, it seems that if this is the plan,
current facilities — especially those for
social use 7 will be stretched beyond their
design and limit.

I would like to propose a different route
to this situation: Build a new social space
first. Not only would this ease the strain on
other campus facilities, but it would also
address a vital need of the student body.
While most of us come to Grinnell College
for an education. it cannot be denied that
our success and desire to remain here are
strongly linked to the quality oi social life.

scheme.

Rube's, In a quest tor real food, we,
along with approximately seventyrfive
percent or Grinnell’s student population,
ended up at Rube‘s, The directions were
deceptive in their simplicity: ”Take 146
north and turn at the sign that says ‘Mon-
tour.‘ It will seem as if you are driving off
into the middle of nowhere,” Were it not
for this last bit of information, which so
clearly distinguished our path from any
omer one in inwa which we might have
taken, We mlght very well have gotten lost.
Isay “might have gotten lost” so you will
not think that We actually did get lost, for
that would be embarrassing,

When we did finally arrive at Rube’s,
though, we had to wait for a table, Our
Waitress seated us in an area near the bar.
0i particular interest were several pieces
of art on the walls 7 paintings on black
velvet of nude women with extremely
large, and peculiarly phosphorescent,
inammaries. As my iriend Ganny pointed
out, “Hey! I've seen mammaries beiore
and they don't look like that!” From my g
personal experience, I am inclined to
agree with Ganny, though I am open to the
suggestion that perhaps Nature makes
women in Iowa a little different from the
way she makes them in other park of the
country. Of course, I should allow the
painter some creative license.

The paintings were particularly
noteworthy because, although I've seen
paintings on black velvet betore, the sub7
jecl never has been naked women. in
Virginia, where I live, one can buy velvet
paintings only at select gas stations on cer-
tain Saturdays. The paintings come in .
many sizes, but the subjects they may por»
tray are limited by law to Elvis Presley,
John Wayne, and Jesus.

Niiiic Things My Father Said

“How is the football team?”

(After having toured the town the
previous‘day) “Let’s walk around and see
the REST of Grinnell."

“Who is Sophie?”

a MOUSC

No matter how you or I define social lite,
it is without question something in which
this college plays a greater role than most
other schools simply because oi the
geographic location of Grinnell. Small
towns and cornfields are nice. but they can
hardly be expected to sotisly the social
needs of a student body as di\ else as ours
Ask anyone Who deals with the external
image of Grinnell College and I “in
guarantee they’ll respond that one of our
image problems is that oi being isolated in
a cornfield, somewhere in Iowa, Idaho, or
Ohio. with nothing to do. How will we over-
come this image and retain a healthy and
socially adept student body it concern for
social weliare is given lowest priority?

This new building might also serve as a
place to house some classes during the
ARK renovation and eliminate the need to
get portable classrooms or to use — aagh
7 dorm lounges!7

I've said it beiore, and i'll say it again...
. This very fine, liberal arts institution ex-
ists because 1200 young and eager people
come and return here each year as
students, It is without question that the
academic and intellectual side of our
liberal arts education is of the finest quali~
ty. Now is the time to ensure than the other

within society 7 is developed to its fullest
potential as well. To provide the program.
we have to provide the space. To provtde
the space, this campus needs a new
building.
