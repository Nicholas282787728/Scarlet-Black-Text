Human Resource Center Established:
Tederman and Gays reach compromise

by Justin Lincoln

A Human Resource Center \\’|ll be in-
stituted at Grinnell College next fall. with
a subdivision of the Center to be known as
the Gay Resource Center.

Shortly after an extensive parley with
student negotiators last Friday Presidenl

. In Support of Star Wars

Alum scientist endorses strategic defense

by Jonathan Greising

A Grinnell alumnus speaking on campus
Tuesday night brought new elements into
the debate raging over the Reagan Ad-
ministration's Strategic Delense Initiative
program. challenging many students' un»
qualiﬁed opposition to the program.

Speaking in South Lounge, Dr, Stephen
Rockwood, '69 suggested potential solu
tions to a number or common objections to
“Star Wars‘ programs. He laid particular
emphasis on the use or charged particle
beams.

Ruckwood's experience includes
graduate work at Caltech and three years'
research at the Air Force weapons
laboratory. He currently supervises laser
research at Los Alamos.

Opening his talk, Rockwood noted the inn
tense public scrutiny SDI research has had
to endure. “Never before have I seen a
research program evoke so much public
interest or public debate,” he said.

He discounted critics or the program
who claim any nuclear deiense system
must provide complete protection to be el-
Iective, saying, “We’re not looking tor a
perlect defense.”

He deiined adequate progress in his
research as “adequate to allow us to step
away from MAD imutually assured
destructlnnl.”

Rockwood outlined the standards a
strategic defense system must meet.
citing survivability, accuracy, cost advan-
tage and etiectiveness as requisites ior an
effective defense against a Soviet strike.

Much controversy over ‘Star Wars' has
centered on fears that tremendously ex-
pensive deiensive systems could be easily
overcome by relatively cheap
countermeasures — ior example, mylar
balloons released from XCBMS in flight
which would be indistinguishable on radar
irom incoming warheads.

Rockwood pointed out that potential
developments in charged particle beams
might ottset such decoys, pointing out that
reflections from particle beams would
allow a space delense satellite to discern
the mass oi an object. The same beam,
amplified, mightalso disable the warhead.

“The rule is ‘If it weighs like an RV
[reentry vehicle] treat it like an RV' " he
explained.

He said the only decoys capable oi
deceiving a particle beam problem would
have to have the same mass as a warhead,
“If they do that, you’re forcing them to loft
duds,” he said, noting that the high cost of
space launched materials made “heavy”
decoys impractical.

Responding to a question, Rockwood ad
mitted that the installation of strategic

defense systems would abrogate the ABM
Treaty.

“At some point, frankly. you have ,to
violate it if you want to deploy the fence,"
he said. However, he added that the terms
oi the treaty restricting research on such
systems were on fuzzy legal ground. He
also noted that parties were allowed to
withdraw from the treaty with six months’
notice.

Asked abut European response to ‘Star
Wars,’ Rockwood admitted the Europeans
initially teared SDI was a iirst step in
American military withdrawn from
Europe. “They really tear the decoupling
ol the United States and the European
community.” he said.

However, he added, “Now what they‘re
grasping is that a lot of SDI technology
may correct a lot of that force imbalance,"
reterring to the heavy conventional advan
tage Warsaw Pact iorees in Europe cur
rently enjoy,

Asked whether Reagan is sincere in his
promise to eventually share SDI
technology with the Soviets, Rockwood
replied, “I think in this issue he's truly
Sincere. SDI for Reagan is like a religion.
It's his mark on history

“lt’s naive, perhaps. I don't know how
the Soviets will respond.”
