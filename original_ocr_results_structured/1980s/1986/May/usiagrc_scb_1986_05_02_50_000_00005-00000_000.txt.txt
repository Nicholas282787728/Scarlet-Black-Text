God Revealed

One day. God woke up and iound himself
. in this article. “Hey!" said God. “where
am I?"

Mike Cleary

I brought you here. I am the author and I
want to reveal you to the world. Besides, I
have a paper due. Let's get started. ii
you're all»poweriul, why is there evil in the
world?”

“Who said anything about being all-
powerful. anyway?" retorted God, You're
God. so you have to be allrpowerful. It's as
simple as that “You actually think that
you have God” Me”" Yes. you. “Don't
answer it. dummy It's a rhetorical ques-
tion." said God. "There may be a God. but
not here. You're just writing about God "

Bul you are God. I should know, I
brought you here "Do I have to prove it?”
asked God, “All right. What sex am I, ‘
Male. Just look at yourself. "Now how did
you know that God was male?” I'm not
God. you are. it you want to be male. that's
fine with me, "Jesus Christ." mumbled
God. Now hon could I have one sex if I
were God? Or why couldn't I be female. or
no sex at all?" he asked.

i don‘t get your point. God sighed “I'll
show you another wa How would you
describe God?" Well you are all-powerful.

evolutionary throwbacks on campus. the

Most recently the presence oi Fort.
signs. which publicized a band that played
on campus April 19th. was the center of at-
tention in a letter to the editor, The letter
connected the F 0 R. signs to violence and
hatred toivards gays. I happen lo know the
person who made the posters. He was very
enthusiastic about the F OR. band from
his hometown. and was intent on getting
publicity for it He made several signs.
some of which quoted theiyrics in one oi
F 0.R.’s songs. The sign which received so
much criticism said "F.0.R, I'm so sick of
a lesbian."

i wish to make three points concerning
this issue; it the freedom to express
oneseli. 2i the unjustiiicd assumptions one
can make from initial impressions. and 3!
the right to hold differing opinions.

The signs for F.0.R, differed markedly
from the mass oi announcements pasted
on campus in that they were spray painted
in red and black on newspaper. They were
put in many unusual places, all of which
was an attempt to attract attention. Yet
almost as soon as the signs were up they
were removed. The maker of the spray
panned F OR. signs vias denied the right
to express his own ieelings. the act oi
which would cause no physical harm to
anyone He did not remove any signs sup-
porting the gay cause but instead posted a
sign stating that GCGC was forgiven for
the several r10 R. signs destroyed out oi
fear and Ignorance. Yet last week's letter
contends they were "removed . out of
hatred and disgust for such vlolclil and
senseless expression "

Tllis brings IIIQ to the uniustlficd

I'm not asking ior miracles. I only want to
know your essential nature “Same thing.
All that stuli you said about me is just
magic powers. You guys who write about
me ought to write sports columns 7 you're
great at exaggeration,"

rm getting tired oi this. God. Just tell
mewhy there is evil in the world “How the
hell should I know?! I'm not God!" Yes
you are. “No l‘m not, i keep telling you.
Listen. I can answer your questions, but
I'll always end up contradicting myseli.
Because I put it in words that you can
understand. words with finite meanings.
These problems you ask me about involve
absolute goodness. ultimate evil. om.
nipotence, and eternity. Do you know what
you want these terms to mean? Do you
think you can? You people always com~
plain that you can't know everything and
appeal to God. Then you claim to know
cool If you can't recognize absolute good.
how can you say it exists? Ur recognize it
even if it were staring you in the face"

“Maybe that is the scope oi divine pro
blenis. but God doesn’t say anything about
them. God doesn't say anything at all,
especially with bright conversationalists
like you.

"Any answer i give would have limited
meaning. Thai doesn't salisiy you. so you
stretch the word so thal it refers to the ab
solute. But you can't extend the meaning.
Your arguments consist of words alone.

assumptions which were made the I~‘.O.R
signs never said anything about “hating"
lesbians and it seems some people were
anxious to read into and inlerpret these
Signs as acls of Violence. Al the time the
Gay Resource Center was a major issue
and it seems the removal of the FO,R
signs and eventual display- at a rally was a
way to identity the enemy instead or
defining sides. I think it would be better for
inquiring minds to iind out why people
dislike lesbians and the deeper roots of
both sides of the issue,

Finally. on this campus ihcrc seems to
be a problem that if one dislikes homosex-
uality, his/her opinions are not looked
upon very kindly. This attitude exists ior
other issues as well I feel it is important
that people should be able to express their
views ireely and no side should be perceiv-
ed as being right or wrong. it we do not
allow differing opinions to exist we Will
have difficulties Ill testing the validity of
our own values.

I do not claim to speak for the maker of
the signs or attempt to express my views
on the Issue, but I hope thal this incident
should serve as a reminder that a severe
conviction ior a cause nlay blind us irom
seeing the other side of an issue. 7

want to believe in God, don't you?” I never
thought about that before. lguess so.

"Why do you want to know God exists“
asked God. I don't know what to say .
um. I guess I want purpose. Everything is
so meaningless without purpose and the
world needs God to give it purpose “No it
