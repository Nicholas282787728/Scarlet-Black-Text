What Constitutes Terrorism? Views Differ

Europeans

Are. Less
Paranoid

by Marty Myszewski

Over the past year Europe has been the
stage for an increasing number of terrorist
attacks against Europeans and
Americans. Students from the countries
where recent terrorist attacks have taken
place were asked about their attitudes
regarding terrorism and about their
perceptions of American attitudes regarr
ding terrorism. There was’a diversity of
opinions based on concerns specific to
their home cities and countries, but there
were several common threads in the
broader discussion of terrorism.

in the comparison between European
and American attitudes about terrorism.
Theo Eicher found it necessary to make
the distinction between the types of ter-
rorism generally directed at Europeans
and those directed at Americans. Eicher
said. “Most of the attacks against Euros
peans are focused on individuals or
specific institutions and the attacks
against Americans are against any
Americans." Most terrorist attacks
against Europeans are by groups with
highly political motives, like Direct Action
and the Red Army Faction. They choose
speciﬁc targets. like the director of
research for the Siemens company, who
was killed last July when a bomb blew up
in his car. and the Paris police heads
quarters, which was bombed on the same
day. killing one inspector and injuring
more than 20 other people,

Attacks on Americans tend to be
directed against any Americans unfor»
tuante enough to be in the wrong place at
the wrong time, like the soldier who was
killed and the 50 other Americans who
were wounded in the bombing of the La
Belle Discotheque in West Berlin in
March, and the four Americans who were
killed when a bomb exploded on a TWA jet
en route to Athens in early April. The terr
rorism most often directed against
Americans is more unsettling because of
its randomness. -

in September ll people were killed and
more than l§0 wounded in five bombings in
Paris. The groups responsible were trying
to force the government to release three
Mideasterners from prison. The French
government reacted by tightening up
border and internal security and renewing
its commitment to international coopera~
tion in preventing terrorism. Guillaume
Bourrier, a native of Paris. was especially
shocked and upset by the September bom—
bings. His family and friends still in Paris
were “frantic. not knowing whether it was
safe to stay or where it was safe to go."
The killing of innocent people angered
him. but not knowing where or when the
terrorists would strike again was deeply
unsettling. Guillaume thinks that
“Americans are justifiably worried about
traveling to Europe", because this random
terrorism is most often directed against
Americans. In contrast. Caitlin Gilbert of
Burgundy. France said the chance of being
a victim of a terrorist attack is too small
for the worry it causes. Burgundy and
other small cities are overlooked by ter-
rorists. Gilbert said, “Most bombings oc»
cur in big cities. The media blows it all out
of proportion and people think there are
bombs going off all the time." it makes
sense to be cautious. but keep things in
perspective. '

Karin Lleupp of Switzerland agrees that
“Americans have more to be worried
about than Europeans. because the United

States is doing more to irritate terrorists. ”
The Reagan “solution” to terrorism of
countering violence with violence is
stupid. An eye for and eye. a tooth [or a
tooth is an unending circle of retaliation,
There can only be action because there is
no basis for communication. Americans
have problems understanding other
cultures and without understanding there
can be no communication. The govern-
ment. the media and the sheer size of the
United States promote the lack of
understanding. Karin noted. ”In Iowa
news about other states is as foreign as
news about France is in Switzerland.”

‘They attribute American
paranoia to the
sensationalism of the
media and the namw .
perspectives of the '
government and the

‘ people. ’

Many Americans do not have the chance to
see other countries and when they do, they
have diitieulty understanding them
because the Unites States is so large and so
homogeneous. They do not or cannot ap~
preciate other cultures. Deupp said. “in
Europe people are daily confronted with
other nations. The media is full of news
about other countries and Europeans are
more likely to see the World as a communi-

ty of equal and soverign nations."

Hesitantly Theo Eicher generalized that
Americans are likely to see the political
world as a pyramid with the United States
at the top and to judge other countries exr
clusively by their own values. The Reagan
Administration is very self righteous and
does not recognize the sovereign right of
other countries if they do not embrace the
same values. Terrorism is in part a reac-
tion to this kind of blind and deafAmerican
foreign policy. Khullood Rahl'nan said that
there is guilt on both sides and until both
recognize this, there can be no solution.
The main barriers to a solution are the
media and the government. The media is
guilty of sensationalism and exaggeration.
and the Reagan Administration en~
courage: the picture of terrorists as “mad
dogs" who act entirely out of malice. The
media. often under government direction,
provide false information about ter-
rorists, notably the “disinformation"
about Quadaffi in August.

Generally foreign students felt less wor-
ried about terrorism than they felt
Americans were. They attribute American
paranoia to the sensationalism of the
media and the narrow perspectives of the
government and the American people
themselves They felt Europeans were less
worried because they were more ac-
customed to terrorism and they knew that
terrorist acts directed against Europeans
generally involve specific people. like cor-
porate executives. military personnel and
government officials. Also Europeans
could not realistically run away from ter-
rorism. unlike Americans who could stay
safe by staying in the United States. As
Caitlin put it, “life goes on and it doesn't
serve to be paranoid."

 

How
Americans
View
Terrorism

by Kristina Scott

What constitutes terrorism? Americans
I asked answered. “people with ski masks
running around blowingrup people,"
“bomb." “hijacking planes." “the Middle
East." and “terror.”

Although Americans among themselves
are going to disagree over what terrorism
is. Grinnellians who have traveled abroad
point out general differences between
foreign and American perceptions of ten
rorism.

The Nicaraguan contras — terrorists or
freedom-fighters? It all depends on whom
you ask. President Reagan has convinced
Congress that they are the latter. Meghan
Hays. who spent the summer of 1985 work-
ing in Nicaragua. has a diiierent opinion:
“President Reagan‘s definition of ter-
rorism is very arbitrary." The contras.
Hays vividly remembers. blew-up houses
where Children were sleeping. She also
recalls one lncident where a truck carryr
ing eight mothers of soldiers defending a
certain area was ambushed by anti-
Sandinista rebels. The women were
gunned-down as they tried to escape.

.“These acts." states Hays. “constitute
the most violent. obscene form of tar
rorism there is. The contras do not try to
attack Nicaraguan leaders of strategic
defenses; rather. they try to scare the
Nicaraguan people into submission."

’For Europeans, terrorism
is a pan of life...they
mock thefears of
Americans.’

What Americans consider terrorism
may be viewed as retribution by others.
This is how some Basque people of Spain.
for example. interpret the actions of the
Basque separatist group ETA. states Tim
Manatt. who worked in Spain last year.
ETA is perceived by some Basques as
“paying the Guardia Civil back for forty
years of terror and suppression of Basque
traditions under General Franco.”

Not only can what we Americans deem
as terrorism have another meaning to difr
ferent foreign nationals. but people abroad
tend to react differently to terrorist acB
than Americans do. Americans reacted
with panic to the upsurge in terrorist ac
tivity last spring. Trips abroad, including
a Grinnell alumni trip to Greece. were
cancelled. Americans stayed at home.

Many that were abroad were asked to
come home. University at Wisconsin
students in Bonn where i studied last year
were offered a full refund on their pro-
gram expenses if they wanted to return)»
the United States before the end of the
semester. . ..

Those Americans who dared venture to
Europe enjoyed the enticements offered
by a hurting European tourist industry and
came back proudly wearing “l survived
summer '36 in Europe" T-shirts.

For Europeans. on the other hand. terr
rorism is a part of life. Their reaction to
terrorism is much more restrained. In
fact. they mock the fear of Americans.

“Europeans live with terrorism every
