”Do you hear something?” Seth asked
me, looking up irom his books. The door to
ARH 219 was cracked about three inches.
A jangling or metal lightly echoed in the
hall be and.

Jim Duncan

1 was preoccupied. with my legsvprop-
ped on the nearest desk, my head tilted
way back, and my mouth gaping wide
open, my brain iought back nightmares oi
Dave McConnell. His killer chimichangas
were sitting none too easy on my stomach.

“Jim?” His voice, faint and far away,
finally reached me in the silence of the
black depths. My consciousness swam
towards the surface. Seth’s Voice grew
louder. “Where’s that rattling coming
fro . . .”

A knee-high German shepherd puppy
raced through the doorway, closely iollow-
ed by a tiny, iurry. multi-colored mutt.

At that exact moment, my lids snapped
open and my glazed eyes cleared,

The larger canine, startled by our unex-
pected presence, planted both iront paws
and backpedaled frantically. The smaller
one smashed into the backside of the
leader with a full head of steam. '

l was equally surprised.

Forced oii-balance, the shepherd sat
down abruptly, still sliding iorward. The
young" one, pawing furiously for pur
chase the slick floor, ﬁnally found it.

Writers? Symposium

Four alumni who have distinguished
themselves as writers have returned to
campus to participate in a Writers' Sym-
posium held in honor or retiring English
proiessor M. M. Llebermann.

novels. two autobiographies, and
“Gentlemen on the Prairie," a historical

ty Press last year His last work, like his
recently reissued account oi growing up in
iowa, “We Have All Gone Away,” retlects
a strong identiiication with the rural
midwest experience

bookstore. The winners oi the steiner
Short Story Prizes and Whitcomb Poetry
Prizes will be announced at 1:30 pm. in

The Human Element

With tail between legs and scrambling for
dear life to attain the open doorway, the
pup miscalculated in its panic and got
creamed 7 solidly smacking into the aged
wooden door frame. With a high—pitched,
sharp yelp, it skidded out of View into the
hallway. ,

The shepherd, still lacing Seth. was
seated on its haunches. With its ears perkr
ed iorward, head cocked inquisitively, and
wet tongue hanging, the hall‘rgrown dog
beat a quick tatoo on the floor with its
bushy tail.

”C'mere," Seth beckoned in a friendly
tone. It rose up and bounded toward him.
And I began to reminisce. , . -

They were terrors, those two dogs. Little
white iurry iootballs on stubby legs. they
could easily shred a person’s bare leg with
their furious pawing and springing up and
down in joyous anticipation oi a little affec-
tion or a tidbit of food. Juan, the cockier of
the two, had sired the mute Puttrputt, but
more than made up for his olfspring's lack
of voice in a bark reputed to kill squirrels.

Mom was always torn between hatred
and adoration of the mostly sedate, but
sometimes fieryrtempered Juan.
Sometimes when she thought no one was
watching, rd see her sneak a little petting
in. Other times, however, especially at
three in the morning, it was all she could
do to restrain herself from crawling out of
bed and droprkicking the yapping little
beast over the neighbor‘s fence.

Putt-Putt, on the other hand, was my
sister's favorite. A silent but {iendishiy
vivacious bundle of pure energy on stum-
py, lightning quick legs, Puttqutt could
burn circles around Juan in battle. He'd
endure only so much abuse from the older
dog before beserking, darting in and nippv
ing his father in the hindquarters, and dane
cing out of reach unscathed. Unaware that
he‘d been attacked until too late, Juan
would be unable to retaliate.

The hostilities would escalate and the
combat could begin, _

If the skirmish became too serious and
blood was drawn, my dad would venture
out into the back yard armed with a folded
newspaper. He'd step into the midst oi flyr
ing iur, throat lodged iangs and guttural
snarls, and deal a iew resounding whaps oi
his own. Thus separated, the two
belligerent, bloodied fighters would retire
to their corners, only to forget the power oi
the press a iew minutes later and return to
war.

They seemed always to be embroiled in
a violent struggle for supremacy over the.
back yard or the possession of a hoarded,
cherished playtoy or juicy bone.

When they weren’t lighting, chowing
down on dry dogiood, or bellyrupped in the
warm sunshine dreaming doggy iantasies,
the two would be attempting escape from
the placid, dull drudgery oi domesticity.

And they usually made it.

More than once they dug under the fence

The results oi the allcampus vote regars
ding the referendum to fund a South
African scholarship were announced at
last Wednesday night’s Joint Board
meeting. According to secretary Diane
Peters, a total of 615 students voted. 409
students voted in favor of the referendum
and 206 expressed their disapproval.

The vote was deemed a success, but
debate continued on the actual possibility
oi iunding the proposed scholarship that
conflicts with administrative policy.
Because the administration states that
Joint Board cannot use accrued funds to
set up a scholarship, alternate means to
raise the necessary money were discussed
by the members oi the Board,

President Susannah Richards said that
she had met with the Trustees to discuss
the scholarship issue. The Trustees outline
ed several reasons ior opposing an son
funded scholarship. According to
Richards, the Trustees would like to see ins
dividual members of the campus come
munity raise money for the scholarship.
They “want individuals to make a state-
ment,” said Richards.

The Trustees also were concerned with
the legality oi a student government
organization directly donating money to
charity. SGA can sponsor fundraising
events, and according to Phil Cantor. a
member oiStudents to End Apartheid, this
method appears to be the solution. Cantor
suggested a cooperative iund-raising
event between SGA and SEA or possibly
having a dorm sponsor an event.

An increase in the student activities fee
was cited by the Trustees as another
reason for opposing the scholarship,
Richards stated that according to Trustee
estimates, the activities fee would have to
be increased in order to fund a scholar»
ship. »

Richards said that President Drake is
encouraging members of the Joint Board
to iind alternate ways to raise the
necessary money and that he would back
any eiiorts to do so. Richards suggested
that seniors may be interested in donating
the $4 charge for renting a graduation
gown to the scholarship She said that she
and other board members would be senr
ding out a letter asking any seniors it they
would be interested in such a proposal.

In. other news, vice-president Pam
Welch announced that three candidates for
the Louise Noun Women's Studies Chair
will be on campus March sand 7, March 10
and ii, March 31 and April 1, respectively.
The candidates will discuss their theses
and the talks will be in South Lounge.
specific Women's Studies courses will be
taught by the chosen candidate.

Karin Nyhus submitted a proposed
resolution opposing the Computer Ser-
vices' plan to transiorm part of the
Younker Memorial Health Center into a
twenty-four hour Rainbow computer facilir
ty. Construction for this renovation is
slated for March 15,

Nyhus objects to the renovation because
it would create too much noise for ill
students and decrease the amount oi space
available The written resolution re
quested that the Computer Services in
vestigate other locations for the facility.

A majority oi board members opted to
postpone a vote on the resolution until
more iniormation regarding the project
can be collected. .

Finally, secretary Diane Peters an-
nounced that the student presidential and
vice-presidential debates will be held Mons
day, March 3 at 7:30 pm. in South Lounge.

PutbPutt, realizing the potential ior at-
tention and affection toward small, cute
and hairy animals in places with a large
number of love-starved people, blazed his
trail in that direction.

The residents oi the Spring Meadows
Nursing Home enjoyed his three-hour visit
immensely, .

I also loved the two warm and wriggling,
wild and crazy pets oi my childhood . . .

Seth smoothed the German shepherd's
shiny coat down and withdrew his hand.
“Here girl,” I coaxed. She trotted over. As
I scratched the area behind her ears. I
found myseli feeling strangely melan-
cholic.

The little mutt that had spooked finally
gathered its courage and peered back in
through the doorway curiously. with her
attention diverted away irom my stroking,
the shepherd slid out from under my touch.

She pounced on the little ones head
playfully, and batted it out the door. Out-
side, the cavorting, clicking sounds or
unclipped nails on slick linoleum faded
away.

“Dinner?” Seth inquired. 7'

“Yeah.” We put on our coats and walked
out. Seth commented on the present leit by
one of the dogs further down the hall. We
