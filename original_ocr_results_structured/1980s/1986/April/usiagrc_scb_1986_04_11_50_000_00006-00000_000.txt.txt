Against Star Wars

Anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems
were once seen as serving an oiiensive role
ior protecting attack missiles and guar-
ding against the inevitable retaliatory
strike, which was supposed to deter any at-
tack in the iirst place. ABM systems have
been recruited for the cause oi deterrence
and on the basis oi that intellectual turs
nabout, these deiensive weapons join the
ranks oi those which deiend the country.

Mike Cleary

The contradictions oi war given the
presence of nuclear conflict are apparent
to all. Deterrence depends on threatening
the enemy with nuclear destruction in the
face oi possible enemy attack. What is so
confusing is that both Sides can be seen as
the defenders.

ABM systems, it is claimed, protect
missiles to be used against attackers.

Thus, they serve a deiensive purpose by
protecting an offensive capability which
defends the country. However, ABM
systems can also protect one country irom
nuclear destruction while it attacks
another. For this reason ABM systems
have been seen as offensive and were ban-
ned by uie ABM treaty in 1972

virtually any weapon or fortification can
be recruited to the cause of deterrence,
due to the contradictions. Every additional
weapon is added to the arsenal because of
its “deterrent value” for the owning counr
try, That country's security is increased.

But for each “pro” argument, there is
another that shows how it destabilizes the
balance oi terror. Each new weapon is one
more reason for the owning country to be
feared. This fear participates both in in-
creasing thatcountry’s security, as well as
increasing the danger of attracting a pre
emptive strike. Each weapon is one more
defense against attack and one more thing
to be defended against in case of attack.

Increases in military power bring both
aspects. Weapons in the nuclear arena
cannot be restricted to deiensive purposes.
In the end, the arms race only increases
fear and tension, never security.

Deterrence depends on the appearance
oi the willingness to use nuclear weapons.
It is possible then, that war could result
after a train of misunderstandings, when
neither superpower intended to wage war

There are other objections to President
Reagan's strategtic Detense initiative, of
which each alone should be enough to per-
suade us of its uselessness. First, the pros
jECt is technologically impossible, con
sidering the degree of security it aspires to
achieve. Second, were the technology
discoverable, it would still cost billions of
dollars to research and install, At a time
when the budget deficit threatens our
economy in both the shortand the long run,
such a project should at least be delayed.
Finally, aiter spending vast sums oi
monev and after a number of years, the

goal of space defenses may be realized.
but by then it may be ineffective against
newer technologies or iar larger — and
cheaper 7 numbers oi missiles.

The chief criticism of ABM systems is
that they do not accomplish what they
were intended to achieve. They do not in-
crease our security while they increase the
arms race. The contradictions of deter~
rence forbid this. These contradictions
were part of the reasons that ABM
systems were banned. If we want to avoid
war, we should understand how nuclear
weapons may come to be used and how to
prevent this.

Fundamentally, the question oi security
rests on trust, Diplomacy and adherence
to international laws and agreements are
the methods we must depend on to ioster
trust. Even if they do not always maintain
our military advantage or parity, the trust
and closer relations which do result will
accomplish much to guarantee our peace
and saiety.

The Human Element

Something small and turry lies crushed
in an unnatural, mangled heap. it looks to
be a iresh kill; stained asphalt shows
around the edges, and the pestering
swarm oi bloated flies usually accompany-
ing such a casualty have not yet caught the
scent oi death. Unseen fingers oi wind
periodically caress ore dead animal’s iur,
ruffling then smoothing it down.

On my left, Justin glances away irom
the unblinking red light above the deserted
intersection and out at the tall North
Carolina pines crowding the roadside, The
sharp thrusting spears oi green needle the
hazy morning sky. A darker blue in the
west flows easily toward the pricked haze,
much as blood courses to an open wound,

Justin's eyes reilect only a painted
stretch of blackened roadway. With one
hand curled lightly over the top oi the
steering Wheel and the other claerike
gripping the stick shift, he focuses on the
single red eye staring back at him

The first week in May the Grinnell Board
of Trustees will hold a meeting at Grinnell.
At this meeting. the Board will review
SEA’s (Students to End Apartheid)
evaluation of companies involved in South
Africa and vote on whether or not to divest
from these companies. The Board's deci»
sion will be based on two standards set in
the resolution passed last May: iailure to
sign the Sullivan Accords and strategic or
technical involvement.

SEA Will recommend the Board divest
its stock in five companies: IBM Corporas
tion. United States Steel Corporation, PNC
Financial Corporation, Exxon Corpora-
tion, and Ford Motor Company. As of last
May, Grinnell's investment in these Corns
panies was almost three million dollars,
Stock in IBM totalled $2,345,421

SEA based its recommendations on con
tinued correspondences with the Corns
panies. It was determined that these com»
panies have a detrimental eiieet on human
rights conditions in South Airica.

SEAS based its decisions on the follow
ing iniormation. IBM makes sales to
private corporations in South Africa which
accept militarv contracts. Although IBM

“OK, I was wrong,” I think somewhat
downfallen.

Maybe i was hoping tor a small. quiet
town of about 200. One with sturdy white~
washed houses, tidy yards, and vegetable
gardens. ,.

Maybe I was hoping for the kind of town
where on warm summer evening young
lovers absorbed in each other's eyes sit
close on the porch swing while the clear
laughter of neighborhood children rings
out as one of them is discovered in a game
of Hide-nSeek..,

Maybe i was even hoping tor the sort of
town in which a cheap weather~beaten
motel, a bit ragged around the edges,
flaunts a swaying sign depicting a white
gull perched atop a group oi pilings and
underneath the handspainted design read
ATLA TIC BEACH l N. because the letters
have blown off ..

We approach a McDonald's, Unlike the
Carcass back on the road, this place. which
“serves over 1 billion" dead meat patties,
is swarming With pesky bloated
businessmen snarling their McBreakfast
with the McMorning McCotiee on the way
to the office.

Justin says matterofrfactly. “I want my
morning coiiee." '

I answer ribbing, “Naw, you don’t need
it! You think you'll go through withdrawal
or something?"

Calmly unamused and very business-

claims it will not knowingly sell computers
to be used for repressive purposes. it em-
phasizes it cannot control the end use of iLs
computers. IBM computers are currently
being used by the government ior racial

United States Steel (Grinnell's invest-
ment, $21,225) holds investments in Com-
panies managed by Angiovaal. Although
Anglovaal has its own code of employment
practices, the code contains no eniorce-
ment. As Anglovaal had not signed the
Sullivan Accords (standards ior employ.

'ment practices in South Africa), there is

no unbiased group to evaluate Anglovaal's
employment conditions SEA recommend
ed divestment based on the standard
failure to sign the Sullivan Accords,

PNC Financ‘ial Corporation's (Grinnell's
investment, 3397.000) loan policy does not
cover traderrelated loans, loans which
may assist domestic corporations in mak
ing sales to the South Airican government.
PNC does not feel it is capable oi entorcing
such a restriction and refuses to use the
work of monitoring groups, such as the Inc

Minutes later, while Justin is cheerfully
sipping away, I‘m still steadying my
nerves from the close call with the lighted
menu board at the drive-thru.

The beach is only about 5 min, away
now ..

Ahhhh,.. The warm sand crawls up bet-
ween my toes The cool sea breeze waits
the long winter hair oii my iorehead and
kisses my lips with a hint of saitiness, The
sun's rays penetrate, burning. Rolling
waves grab vainly for the beach in a roar
ing, pounding white rush and‘fall back,
leaving behind scattered treasurers for
beachcombers to Claim for their own.

The ocean is too chilly to swim in but is
fine for a brief wading, The undertow
sucks the sand from under my feet, mak-
ing looting unpredictable.

The gulls circle and scream. Later, as a
scrawny-legged man and his oily. rotund
wife eat their lunch, the sea birds drop
down to the beach in hordes alld surround
the two, shrieking for morsels. Some even
make daring attempts to plunk the sand.
wiches right out of their hands.

Justin and I toss the irisbee around for
awhile.

We lie down on the blanket. There‘s a
coast guard base around the point and we
watch through thebinoculars a helicopter
hovering over one of the many fishing
vessels about a mile offshore churn with

strategic or technological involvement.

Exxon (Grinnell's investment, $25,4197
sells to the government under a general
Contract. South African law prohibits the
disclosure oi how Exxon's petroleum pro
ducts are used, SEA recommended divest-
ment based on the standard strategic or
technological involvement.

Ford Motor Company (Grinnell's invest.
ment $29,125) recently completed a
merger with South African'Motor Corpora-
tion (SAMCOR). in past years. 5% of SAM-
con's sales have been to the government
with 1% oi such sales going to the police
and military. SEA’s recommendation was
based on the standard strategic or
technological involvement.

Bishop Desmond Tutu's call tor
economic sanctions against South Africa
reaffirms SEA'S belief that Grinnell must
divest. We hope the Board take special
care in reviewing our recommendations,
Divestment is the logical step for the
Board to take to express its commitment
to halting the deplorable conditions in

blades.

Then something big leaps right out of the
water somewhere between us and the
helicopter, Excitedly, I iorce Justin‘s eyes
into the glasses, He then spots the whole
herd of grampus whales.

My interest turns away irom the whales
after a time and toward some other scanti-
1y clad sea creatures strolling down the
beach Excitedly,1force Justin’s eyes into
the glasses ,.

We play more irisbee, The sun is burning
pleasantly now. We rest. We walk up the
beach We walk back down. The sun is bur-
ning pleasantly..,

The day stretches on.

We hardly notice when the cool breeze
begins to chill, to bite The sun is lower,
and the tide is coming in. It's time to run.

The waves lap at our heels as we run
along the sand. The looting is soft, and it’s
hard to get purchase A tendril of foamy’
water catches me unawares, and tries to
drag my left foot back into the Atlantic
Ocean with it,

Almost sunset. All of the gulls have
mysteriously disappeared. So have most of
the sun worshippers. An old man and
woman toddle down the beach. She’s in»
terested in shells, and stoops to pick one
up. He amuses himseli by kicking'up little
clouds oi sand and sauntering along with
his hands thrust deep in his pockets. The
