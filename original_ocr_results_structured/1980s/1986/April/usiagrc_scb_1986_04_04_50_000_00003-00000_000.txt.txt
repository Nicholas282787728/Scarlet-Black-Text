H1-tech Scots

by Justin Lincoln

in the field of Anthropology, all research
revolves around excavating and examine
ing relics oi past eons, right? Guess again.
Consider an anthropologist studying the
growth of high-tech industry in present
day Scotland. Anthropologist and high
tech industry? l-ligh-tech industry in
Scotland? Whoa‘ I!

Last summer, Anthropology proiessor
Douglas Caulkins did indeed begin a long.
term study ot cultural changes being
wrought by the rapid development ol the
electronics industry in peripheral U,K.,
and especially in “Silicon Glen", an area
between Edinburgh and Glasgow which
boasts over 300 highrtech ﬁrms

Caulkins said that Silicon Glen's initial
success has been largely due to the ettorts
oi the Scottish Development Agency,
“funded by the central government to
coordinate and finance regional develop
merit," in an attempt to oltset high
unemployment in other industries, the
Agency lured many toreign lirms to the
region, including IBM, Burroughs, and
Digital Equipment.

The number ol new jobs has not
alleviated the entire problem. and,
Caulkins said, the Scots have lound
themselves subject to the unpredictability
of international markets. Thus. many have
become “convinced that the best hope (or
longrterm economic recovery lies in mire
luring homegrown entrepreneurs.”

However, for increased local en-
trepreneurship to become a reality.
Caulkins has observed that several
cultural obstacles must be overcome,
First, he reported‘that “the Scottish
universities produce more rlrSt‘rate
engineers and scientists than can be
employed locally [and] many move south,
to England [or jobs,”

Also, he's found that “starting a
business of one’s own is not a career option
considered by most youths"; children are
taught to pursue medicine, law, or a posi-
tion with a large tirm. Finally, ror many
Scots, a business iailure “constitutes a
serious social stigma", thus the risky
business is rarely ventured.

Caulkins plans to return to continue his
study this summer, and will also have an
opportunity to conduct research during the
second half 01 next fall’s “Grinnell-in-
London" semester, a program he helped
establish. Some of his findings have
already appeared in a book, A JOB T0
LiVE, by Shirley Williams, who visited
Grinnell while writing her book.

Professor Caulkins has noted that
Scotland’s experience may hold some
lessons for Iowa “in its pursuit at
economic development.“

The small smagoan village near
Flagstali, Arizona, which dates from the
AD lloo's provides unique research oppor
tunities to students, Although a lot or work
was done on the Sinaguans in the 19405,
new techniques and approaches have
allowed Grinnellians to make some impor-
tant discoveries

The program otters ample opportunities
for student independent research, White
taker noted that this semester, Jackie Jen-
dras ('87) is conducting analyses of some
ol the 50,000 pottery sherds collected each
summer.

She also said Neil Weintraub ('86) is
analyzing pollen in order to gain more in
sight into the economic structure or the
village. For example, it there is much corn
pollen uncovered in a room, this can reveal
its use as a storage iacility.

Kamp was quick to point out that the
possibilities are not limited to anthro~
majors. Last semester. chemistry major
Betsy Apel ('86) conducted atomic absorp
