Walker links “Fan Club” tie to firings

Administration’s

“'

by Seth Meisel with Melissa Kagie and Laura McDermith

Calling the administration's reasons for
his dismissal inadequate. David Renaud,
assislant director of Computer Operations
and senior systems analyst, is seeking an
apology and reinstatement irom the cols
lege.

The administration, citing “a lack of

good judgement and a demonstration ol’

unprofessional conduct,” ﬁred on Thurs
day, Nov. 18, Mark Grundler, coordinator
of Administrative Computing and director
oi Computer Operations, and Renaud.

Their dismissal followed an almost four-
hour deliberation by the president‘s statl'
Thursday alternoon. After the meeting,
Executive Vice-President Waldo Walker
informed Grundler and Renaud of the deci-
Slon. Standard procedure then dictated
that the Computer Center be closed to
avoid possible breaches of security.
Walker clearly stated, however, that the
integrity oi Grundler and Renaud was
never in question

Walker refused to specifically detail Ute
reasons ior the two employees‘ dismissal.
However, he did admit that Renauld's and
Grundler's membership in the approx
imately 25~m em ber Tom Moberg Fan Club
tTMFCl was one reason. Moberg serves as
director to Academic Computing and
supervised Grundler and Renaud. He
declined to comment on the terminations.
Walker criticized the club saying that its
existence implied intimidation and harasss
ment of a staff member which clearly
violates Grinnell conduct policy. Further,
he explained that the high rank oi Renaud
and Grundler demanded exemplary
behavior in use or the computers and high
standards.

Renauld and Grundler's role in the
TMFC and the club's nature have been
questioned by the administration. Accors

ding to Renaud, the club was “a group oi
iriends who had a history oi socializing in
the past: the group wanted a new title.
Also, it was new reason to have a loose
association and, more, being very
disgruntled with current academic com»
puting policies and less than enamored
with the person responsible [or those
policies, this group or people started a
tongue-in-cheek tan club tor the person
responsible for those policies." Grundler is
to talk with the 5&3, pending consultation
with his lawyer.

Renaud said he is still mystified as to the
cause [or his dismissal. He said, “As far as
i can get from the admistration, and I call-
ed them the day after I was tired and asks
ed Mr, Walker again to speciiy the reasons
ior my iiring, all he really would say was
that I was using the computer as a game
and that it was poor judgement ior me to
be in the club anyway, even loosely
associated with this group which called
themselves the Fan Club. I think that my
association with the Fan Club was
peripheral at best, more accurately, as
several people in the club will testlly, a
restraining influence , . I feel I certainly
have the right to associate with whatever
group of friends I want to as a human be
ing and the administration has no right to
exercise any censorship or dictorial con-
trol over who may be my friends"

Renaud countered the charge (that he
has used the computer as a game by sen»
ding personal messages on it) by citing the
trequent use oi the mail program and the
large library of computer games. He gave

, the example that the game “Adventure"
has been played by both Walker and his
secretary, Rita Tindle.

Renaud and Grundler's involvement in
the TMFC was proven by evidence un-

covered in their personal mail tiles and
presented by Moberg to Walker Thursday
aiternoon According to Computer Ser-
vices policy, only Walker, Moberg or
Grundler could have authorized an inn
vestigation into the computer accounts.
Walker said be presumed Moberg had in-
itiated the investigation. Moberg declined
to confirm this.

However, it has been established that

Academic Programmer Mary Verkade’

was reviewing the files of Renaud,
Grundler, Ron Renaud, computer
operator, and student Melinda l-lunt
Because of this fact, Grundler presented
Walker with a formal complaint against
this action early Thursday morning. David
Renaud expressed his resentment oi what
he perceives as a violation oi his privacy.

“1 teel pretty much that my rights had
been violated in this sense. The intormas
tion that was gathered regarding my
association with the group known as the
Fan Club was gathered in a way that I con-
sider analogous to rummaging through my
files on my desk and iinding something or
interest, making a xerox copy and taking a
copy of it to Wally Walker's Office," he
said. “I have nothing to hide. All the infor-
mation that was gathered was of trivial
importance and in no way implicates me of
any wrong doing," he continued,
“Nonetheless, Since it is their atrleastr
stated belief that it does implicate wrong-
doing, 1 Ieel that the issue that needs to be
addressed is the Violation oi my privacy, it
is apparently the oiiicial view oi the ad-
ministration that anything on the Com-
puter is ‘tair game' ior at least the direc
etor of academic computing."

Walker presented the administration‘s
position on the investigation: "Entry into
student files is a violation of nothing as far

Judgement call” questioned by Renaud

as the college is concemed . , .The tact
that one looks into the me may be quese
tionable to some people but when one looks
in the iile and doesn‘t iind anything, then
that may present some problem oi
disciplinary action But when one looks in
to the tile and finds something, then it‘s a
whole different issue."

When questioned on the legality oi this
he replied, “This isn't a court at law, This
is a college and the computer is ours and
the people who work on the computer are
employed by us and we draw the regula-
tions. We do not view the regulations as
regulations that are designed under the
law. They are college regulations and ii
you violate one oi our regulations oi
employment, we will terminate you."

Basically, Walker felt that determina
tion of wheUter Renaud's and Grundler's
actions warranted an investigation was a
“ judgement call," “it's a question to their
judgement oi the gravity of the situation as
opposed to our judgement oi the gravity oi
the Situation," he said.

Walker did say however, that the college
will be reevaluating the computer center‘s
policies. He explained, “One good thing
has come out of it and that is that it's caus-
ing the college to take a good look at a
mature computer operation, The operation
has come of age now and we haven't had
the time or hOWstosdosknowledge of how to
establish policies for it."

Renaud is still quite upset with the situa-
tion, He concluded, "I don't see any reason
why they terminated our positions. The
college owes us the positions back. In tact,
they owe us an apology in addition to that
(or whatever damage they've done to us in
terms oi any iuture career possibilities
and certainly the stigma of being iired and
the damage done to my reputation "

Knausstalks on lARAL, Moral Majority

Says 80 percent of Americans support pro-choice

by Jeff Raymond

Loi'i Knauss, state coordinator of the
iowa Abortion Rights Action League
(IARAL) and a 1980 graduate 0t Grinnell
College. gave a one~hour presentation last

Saturday aiternoon in Main Lounge.
Knauss gave her presentation, including a
slide show. to about a dozen people. mostly
women irom the college, beiore entertain-
ing questions and comments irom those
gathered at the meeting.

Knauss began her presentation by tellr
ing the group about herseli and lARAL
She became politically active ior the iirst
time when she worked on the successiul
campaign oi a Democratic state senator
irom Waterloo in the 1980 race. Later she

worked during the senate sessions. She
saw all oi the mail that was received
through the oitice oi the senator, espeClals
ly on the topic oi abortion. Knauss said
that the great majority or the letters were
irom the Moral MaJDrity and were opposed
to abortion She was disturbed that even
though most people lilo percenli support
the prochoice position, these people were
almost silent compared to the “organized
and vocal" Moral Majority.

lARAL, a group iounded in 1979, claims
2,000 members in its ranks. This highly
regarded member oi the National Abortion
Rights Action League tNARALl claims a
solid inundation oi support in lowa. IARAL

is a single-issue organization and does not
want to broaden its base oi political issues
[or tear oi losing support ior its pranchoice
position. The group is strictly political in
its iunction yet it can't endorse or actively
support any political candidates because
of its tax status. Knauss pointed out that
lARAL is pro-choice, not proeabortion and
added, "Nobody is prosabortion but we
believe that it is the choice OI the woman to
have an abortion "

A prepared slide presentation reierred
to the “opposition," the Moral Majority, as
“shrewd and fanatical." It continued,
“They will stop at nothing to achieve .
total ban on abortion." The taped na

tion also illustrated how the Moral Majorir
ly uses iunding restrictions, electoral
politics. constitutional changes and a
iavorite method, harassment, to get their
way The tape also told oi gains by the op-
position, especially in the 1980 Supreme
Court ruling that stated the iederal
government is no longer obligated to iund
abortions, thus leaving the decisions up to
the states. it then w‘arned oi an impending
ban on abortions. Knauss later reiterated
the points made in the presentation and
talked about the various amendments and
bills pending beiore Congress that would.
in varying degrees. make abortion and
some birthrcontrol methods outlawed.

Grinnell’s youngest trustee curious about social life

ter says finances greatest strength of school

by Laura McDeimlih

As Grinnell College's youngest trustee.
Steven Jobs otters a slightly different
perspective on being a trustee and on stu-
dent liie in general. Jobs, in his mid-20s,
was cosiounder and is currently Chairman
oi the Board oi Apple Computer in Cuperr
tino, CA, Jobs was introduced to Grinnell
by Bob Noyse oi lntel Coporation. also a
trustee at Grinnell,

Jobs attended Reed College in Oregon
ior a little over one and onehali years.
Aside irom the academic experience,
which is expected in any college situation,
Jobs was especially impressed and excited
by the social atmosphere that was present
at Reed. The majority of students at Reed,
according to Jobs, did not know what they
wanted to do with their lives, which meant
a large group ol‘ people were concentrated
together asking questions and experienc
ing'many diiierent things.

Jobs relayed the trustees' desire to
maintain Grinnell's status as a liberal arts
institution. “The liberal arts college only
exists in America," The trustees believe in
the value or a liberal arts education, accorr
ding to Jobs. There is an "educational
need to have a place that teaches people
how to think," he said, rather than simply
training them in one particular area.

About Grinnell in particular, Jobs is
cautiously enthusiastic. He expressed a
desire to spend more time with students in
order to learn more about the social side of
Grinnell, "The campus is okay,” said Jobs
and mentioned his disappointment at the
rennovations. Jobs admitted that rennova-
tions were necessary, but he disapproved
of the decor and called it "plywood veneer
shit.”

trustees. The trustees, according to Jobs,
"really care about the students and are
quite concerned with maintaining Grin-
nell's reputation as a line liberal arts in-
situatlon," He described an ad-lib discus
sion by a number oi the trustees who had
arrived early, Their fiverhour
philosophical discussion was centered on
how to make Grinnell an even better
educational institution.

Practically speaking, Grinnell's
greatest strength is its iinancial support,
according to Jobs. He explained that many
colleges must move away irom a liberal
arts curriculum towards more commers
cially attractive courses of study since the
number oi applicants to college has
decreased. But Grinnell has a strong ﬁnan-
cial base so tuition costs can be kept down
which encourages interest in' Grinnell.
