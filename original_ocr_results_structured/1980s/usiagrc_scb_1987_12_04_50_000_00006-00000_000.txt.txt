Campus intolerance irks student

To the Editor:

Conservative, liberal,
Democrat, Republican, jock, nerd
yuppy, granola kid, Jesus treak,
sinnnr, homo, etc.; we have so
many groups or labels that enable
us to neatly box people up on this
campus. Just stamp a sticker on
someone, crate them up, shelve
them away, and you won’t have to
ever deal with them again it you
don't want to. I’ve been meaning to
write this letter tor a long time rd
always tell myseli that I didn't
have the time or that I wasn‘t. the
right person to put iorth what i
have to say because oi past com
ments, but what it comes down to
is iear. Fear not only that what I
have to say will be rejected but
also that i will be packaged up
along with my thoughts and shelv-
ed away. But, I also realize that
there is tear on both sides, A tear
that the other ideas and belieis will
spread like a disease it individuals
are not contained by the ostracism
oi their labeled groups.

what is it about this campus that
.t is unable to tolerate these other
groups? why should they be in-
limtilated into silence with graiiiti
on bathroom walls and snide
remnrks behind their backs” Few
people seem to be willing to openly
challenge the other group's
philosophy or values. And when
people are bold enough to throw a
tow \ erbal stones, they turn out to
be phrases such as “You're wrong
notoiise, well, because you arel",

tnn‘ve been brain washed by so

interview
criticized

To the Editor:

1 have a question. Why did the s
and B ask Rev. Jackson speciticalr
ly questions about the black posi-
tion in higher education? You ask»
ed him one question about the
presidential race and his lack oi
iunds. and proceeded to ask ques-
tions dealing specitically with the
iact that he is black, and which did
not in any way deal with the
presidential race. Come now, is

- this just a black person who has

succeeded thence the question on
advice ior black students)? He is
running ior president, and i wish
\tiu nould have treated him as a
ll-gitlmate Candidate in your inter
view 7 Bruce Friedrich, '91

Editor's note:

It is the S and 3': policy not to in-
terview political candidates and
their supporters about their
speciiic political platiorms. This is
done as it is impossible to give ade-
quate coverage to all candidates
and to all their views, especially
since interviews are generally
limited to a very small number of
questions. In the s and B inter-
views with Barbara Bush, Mrs.
Babbitt, Al Gore, Sr., Du Pont's
son. etc, the Presidential cam»
paign promises are always
downplayed and ignored it possi-
ble. and other issues of interest to
the student body are featured.

Thereiore, in keeping with this
policy, the S and B did not ask Rev,
Jackson about what he plans to do
if elected President. instead, the
areas deemed most pertinent m
the student body at that time were
addressed. As Rev. Jackson is con-
sidered one of the foremost leaders
in the sphere of afﬁrmative action.
asking him about the “black posi~
tion in higher education" is entire-
ly appropriate.

 

and so and such and such
“That‘s the way i iecl. i don't have
to justiiy mysell to someone like
you, You're just wrong." Phrases
that seem to ring oi the sound oi a
child who declares his spinach to
be ”bad” and his carrots to be
“good." Neither iood is more
meritorious oi its label than the
other; it is simply a matter or
taste. Good or bad has nothing to
do with it ‘

it seems that the campus is willr
ing to be tolerant oi these groups
only to the point oi comiort. it a
group's practices make them unr
comiortable, then the group is at
lacked. Isn’t it better to reason
with people instead oi attacking
them? Many would reply “no,"
claiming that the others are too
closerminded, the others don't
listen to what is being said, the
others are unreasonable.

Unreasonable? Are you justify
ing your complaints with solid
reasoningl Alter all, how can one
be unreasonable when all that is
being said is a mass oi unsupr
ported assertions? If someone
doesn’t appear to be listening,
iirst, look to yourseli to make sure
that you are arguing instead oi
making a lot of smoke. Then, it the
person still doesn't listen, you can
consider them to be unreasonable.
But. it you are Just trying to
smother someone by making your
voice louder than theirs, your
meaningless words don't deserve a
lot oi consideration, much less a

Political bad
attitude decried

To the Editor:

I’ve noticed a discouraging at
titude in the midst oi the presided
tial campaign lei-var here at Grin-
riell. That attitude is one belonging
to amateur political strategists
who won't vote for a candidate
because he is “unelectable”, even
it that “unelectable” candidate
best represents her views. This at-
titude is especially evident in
reference to Jesse Jackson’s carnr
paign. ican’t keep silent about this
uniounded allegation in light of two
simple arguments.

First, a moral one, Our
democracy is built upon represen~
tation. Selling your vote to a can-
didate on the basis of electability
degrades this ideal. in a country
where your vote is your strongest
voice, why stiile that voice, why
misrepresent your beliefs? ll peo-
ple don‘t vote their conscience,
how can our needs be noted, let
alone served 7

Second. a statistical argument
(poliucos aren't necessarily moral
beings». Jackson has proven
political power. in the 1984
primaries, a 7 candidate field, he
received 21% oi the popular vote,
and won 4 southern states and the
District at Columbia. In addition,
he added 2 million loyal
Democratic voters and continues
this registration today. In the last
election, the Rainbow Coalition
vote made the difference in regain»
ing Democratic control at the
Senate in Florida, Georgia, N.
Carolina, Louisiana, and Califorr
nia. Jackson and the Rainbow
Coalition were key players in the
rejection of Robert Bork‘s nomina-
tion. It is possible for Jackson to
win the Democratic nomination
and the general election it political
second guessing doesn't rob him oi
the broad-based support he. in

response. Besides, think about
what would happen it the "other"
group's voice became louder than
yours. Do you want to be treated
with the same tolerance that you
have shown? And, even it you are
iorever the more powerlul, do you
really think that you can totally-
eliminate the contrary opinion”
And, which is the most important
to you, to act just or to simply be
called just?

Also, remember that all ideas
must be allowed to be expressed it
there is to be true tolerance on this
campus. As Mill would contend,
nearly every idea has some
amount oi truth in it. And even it
there is no truth to an idea, that
idea should still be heard so that
people can explain why it is wrong,
it truth is never challenged, it runs
the risk oi being believed to be true
In the same way that prejudice is
believed.

But most important oi all,
realize that individuals compose
these .groups. And; these in-
dividuals do not always believe
everything that their stereotypical
