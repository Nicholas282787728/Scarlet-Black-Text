“We are at the moment poised on
the brink of making a decision about
this building,” Waldo Walker, col-
lege vtce-president, said ata faculty
meeting Wednesday in South
Lounge.

Administrators say the campus
should not have to wait until the
tntstees meet in October for a verr
diet on the student center, and say
they are hoping for a decision to be
made in the interim.

“What we’re doing now. is we’re

trying to consult wtth the trustees to
decide what to do — whether to go
ahead at this higher cost or trim the
project some to the level approved
by the trustees,” college president
George Drake said.

”We're going to do a building,
there's no question about that. The
qucstton is what the cost is,“ he said.

said. He explained that the building
ts in “a strategic location.”

“I don‘t want to muck up that part
of thc campus with a bad building,"
he said.

 

“You have before you," colr
lege president George Drake
told the Senate subcommittee.
“a foolish person."

It was May 19 and the occa-
sion of this alleged foolishness
was a meeting in Washington,
DC of a Senate Appropria'
lions Subcommittee. The Sena-
tors were listeniug to testimony
from halfa dozen collegeprcsir
dents, who were asking for
money to improve theirscience
programs.

The chancellor of the Uni~
versity of Nebraska was speak—
ing, doing his bit of lobbying.
when his testimony turned to
the use of the funds.

“Facilitieswouldbenice,“he
said, “but that’s not a high pri-
ority for us.“

Bob Kerrey, DemocratofNe«
braska, replied, “Well I‘m glad
you‘re not so foolish as to ask
for money for facilities."

George Drake then took the
stand to ask for money for fa-
cilitiesi

“It was not exactly the best
atmosphere for the beginning
of my testimony,“ Drake says.

He was asking, on behalf of
the National Association of In-
dependent Colleges and Uni-
versities,forthe foolishly small
amount of $75 million dollars

The National Science Founda-

words, are meeting only about 20
percent of their facilities costs.

Grinnell is in that same lousy
boat, Drake says.
