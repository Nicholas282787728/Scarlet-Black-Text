Swill I. III - SM. 17, ll!

BEST BET. . . The movie of the weekend,
or maybe even the semester, is without a
doubt the Bette Davis classic All About
Eve (1950). Okay all you loyal fans, now is
the chance to see the definitive Davis i'ilrn.
She was born to play this role. The movie
deals with Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter),
a ‘sweet’ young star, clawing her way to
the top over the backs of any available per-
son. Her entre into the theater world
comes in the term of Margo Charming
(Davis), who naively views Eve as “a
lamb loose in our big stone jungle,” Ha!
This lamb pulls the wool over Channing’s
eyes for a while, but when she figures out
what has been going on, all hell breaks
loose. The supporting cast (Celeste Holm,
Gary Merrill) is excellent throughout, with
George Sanders playing the role of the
cruel critic to perfection. Real film buffs
will enjoy seeing Marilyn Monroe in one of
her first bit parts, She appears on Sander's
arm as a starlet whom he introduces as a
graduate of the “Copacabana School of
Drama“; you can imagine where the ac-
tion goes from there. This film abounds
with ‘Davis-isms’ as she takes total com-
mand of the screen, cigarette in hand and
utters such immortal lines as “I despise
cheap sentiment." This film, though over
thirty years old, retains all its life and re-
mains a classic orall time. So see this film
and “Fasten your seat belts, we’re in for a
bumpy ride.”

FINE FARE. . . Another topnotch film,
though a bomb at the box office, is Terr
rence Malick‘s Days of Heaven (1973). Set
in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, the film
depicts a loss of the innocence of a person,
a society and a country. A migrant worker
Bill (Richard Gere) Lakes off for Texas
with his lover Abby (Brooke Adams) and
his sister Linda (Linda Manz). There, the
trio work harvesting wheat for a lonely,
wealthy farmer (playwright Sam
Shepard), The couple design a way of get.
ting money from the man, namely in the
form of Abby. However, they didn’t count
on her falling in love with him. The
characters are all Victims of blind faith in
a warped, unreal American dream. The
meaning of the film emerges more broadly
in symbols and images than in the players.
Visually, this movie is absolutely
breathtaking and the equally excellent
score contributes immensely t0 the effect.
Though a him of few words, the impact is
great.

SOME FUN TRASH. . .Atlention all closet
Clint Eastwood fans here’s the movie [or
you — The Good, The Bad and The ugly
(1967). This spaghetti western features a
tale of stolen loot, double crossing part-
ners, endless violence and, of course,
Clint. With such stone-laced acting, you’ll
wonder how Clint ever got wrinkles. The
movie is for fans 01 the genre only.

DON'T FORGET. l . Pablo Picasso: The
Legacy of a Genius, a ﬁlm exploring the
breadth of this fabulous artist's
achievements. The film focuses on a group
of 13 key works which vividly represent
major turning points in Picasso's career.
New and important ideas with Picasso’s
work surface during the course of the film,
providing a greater understanding 01
perhaps the greatest artist of this century.

Bur-hopping soon? A drinker's guide:

by Catherine Ingrassia

Thinking about a night on the town and
curious as to the relative merits of the
various alcohol purveyors in the area". To
save you the time and trouble of bar-
hupping, a little unscientific research was
done to facilitate your search for that
thirst-quenching drink. The tour drinking
establishments frequented by students and
investigated in full are the longhorn, The

Bar, JlDJs and The Pub.
For a time, the Longhorn stood as an old

and revered Grinnell institution. But Since
the addition of paneling and a salad bar,
the ‘Horn seems to attract more townspeo-
ple than students (particularly up»
perclassmen who recall the days of Peter
Young and seedy decor). However, the
'Horn does have the best weekly specials
in town (see advertisement) and a Happy
Hour two-iornne with prices which easily
beat The Pub's. Also, the food, for the
money, is about the best around and the
drinks are competitively priced, 0n tap,
the Longhorn has Bud, Busch and Bud Lite
for $2.50 a pitcher, $.60 draws, plus their
own special concoction, Scotties. The
Longhorn can also whip up about any drink
imaginable and the real ice-cream in their
ice-cream drinks comes through. One
slight draw back is the fact that the place
closes atone, but that can be fun too, if you

make it in time for last call, Still
quintessentially Grinnell, albeit generic,‘
the Longhorn remains a welcome
nightspot.

Ii more local color fits the bill,
The Bar stands as the place to go. Pool
tables, dark corners and a sporadic pop-
con-i machine make this .“joint” an in-
creasingly popular sport for college types.
However, for some reason the beer is the
most expensive in town (maybe it’s the at-
mosphere). 0n tap The Bar offers Bud,
Blue, Natural light and Coors light for
$3.00 a pitcher, 3.60 a draw; Michelob goes
for a stiff $4.00 a pitcher, $.70 a draw. Their
other offerings remain pretty basic, from
highballs ($1.00) to margaritas ($2.50).
Not long ago, The Bar used to have the best
happy Hour around, but now it has only
Pabst Blue Ribbon at $30 a draw and a
highball at 5.50 on special. Another plus,
depending on your taste in music, could be
the jukebox, boasting a lot of Waylon and
Willie. With the right people the place pro
vides a good time and a real Mid-Western
charm.

.Iust upstairs Sits .I.D.'s, the object, for
some reason, of respect and awe from an
occasional freshman. Depending on your
standards, this place ranks as either a nice
quiet corner or a rather dull bar. Most fre
quently found there are faculty members

and students with money; the drinks rank
as fine but a bit expensive. Similarly, the
food rates as good (try a cheeseburger-
baked potato combo) although also high
priced. The most appealing thing about
J.D.’s must be their wide-range of im-
portcd beers, anything from Guiness Stout
to Foster's Lager. 0n tap, you can get
Special Export and old Style for $2.25 a pit-
cher, 5.60 {or draws, Natural Light {or
$3.25 and $.70, and now, Beck Beer for $1.25
a draw. But somehow for all its cozy at-
mosphere, quiet intimacy can still be hard
to come by here. Generally a nice spot for
a special evening out.

Last but not least is The Pub, definitely
the most popular, or at least the most ac—
cessible Spot around. What can be said
about the light blue walls, glorious ceiling
fans and formica bar? Yet for all its at-
tributes The Pub remains the place to see
and be seen. The standard offering in-
cludes [our beers on tap, Bud, Busch, Bud
Light and Michelob, some bottled beers
and carbonated beverages. If you like
cheap beer, iooze ball or being scrutinized
by your peers, then The Pub cannot be
beat.

Now that you know the relatively inside
story (available to anyone who steps inside
any oi the named bars) maybe you can
gain some perspective and settle down to
some serious drinking.

 

New troupe
members
chosen

by Susan Carlson

“It should be fun for the audience and
the dancer.” That is the type of experience
Babe Voertman, director of the Grinnell
College Dance Troupe hopes the troupe
provides, This year lo new members were
selected to join with the returning six
members from last year in the ranks of the
dance troupe. The new members are
Maria Garrity, Thomas Gerhardt,
Stephanie Haims, Dana Leach, Todd Ober-
man, Lisa Piediscalzi, Althea Ricketts,
Diane Shields, Tina Svenson and Catherine
Wilson.

These new members, selected by the
returning troupe, were chosen on the basis
of their technical ability and Creativity.
According to Voertman, this year's Selec-
tion was especially difficult to make, since
many students auditioning were on par
with each other. An attempt was made to
balance the number of members from
each class so that only a few dancers fail to
return each year. This goal is not always
attainable and consequently only
six members were left from last year due

’to graduations, leaves and foreign pro—

grams. The six remaining members are
Karen Strauss, Katrina Woitu, Malina
Tedesco, Cathy Wohlleben, Jennifer Kint-
ner and Lisa Cohen.

Voeriman desires the dance troupe “to
be as professionally proficient as beginn-
ing dancers can be.” However, her prin
cipal interest is in “developing young peo-
ple who, through dance, develop their im-
aginative and creative capabilities and
who work to go beyond cliche and discover
the originality that lies within.”

”Mother of women's music"
to perform on Saturday

by Catherine ingrassia

Meg christian, veteran singer,
songwriter and guitarist, will be the sen
cond performer in the series of “Women
in Music" concerts,

A native of Lynchburg, Va., Christian
has been involved in music since the age of
live. She began playing local clubs in
Washington, D.C , in the late ’605, where
her emerging feminist Consciousness exV
pressed itsellin songs thatspoke truthfully
and supportively about women's lives and
about her own experiences.

As the “founding mother of women's
music,” Christian‘s efforts have had a ma
jor impact on creating a new women’s
cultural movement. in her own words,
“The world does so much to try to isolate
us 7 I want to use my music to help us sup-
port one another’s process and celebrate
our mutual strength."

Christian’s first release, I Know You
Know (m5), established her as a pioneer
in women's music, spurring scores of other
women to write and perform their own
varieties of women‘s music. The next two
albums, Face the Music (15777) and Turn-
ing It Over (Hal), confirmed Christian’s
standing as a top-notch composer and per
former.

“Christian can be compared quite
favorably to. . . Joni Mitchell and Rickie
Lee Jones. She's a fine singer with a good
range, excellent diction and intonation,
and a composer with special insights that
she’s able to put across in a most appeal-
ing fashion." — Todd Evertt, Los Angeles
