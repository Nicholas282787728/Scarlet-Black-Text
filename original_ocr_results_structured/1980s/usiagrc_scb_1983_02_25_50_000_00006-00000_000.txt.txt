David Dorsey's layup coming on or a
Steal three minutes into last Tuesday’s
game at home against Cornell provided
the Pioneers with the first two of their 46
points in the game. Although Grinnell has
been averaging close to 70 points per
game, baskets were a precious commodity
for both teams as the Pioneers hung on to
win, 4545.

The game was certainly not boring to
watch, but both teams proved that the best
delense is a good ollense by running
steady ball control offenses that did not
produce many scoring attemts.

Dennis Blyly, who was averaging 16.4
points per game before Tuesday‘s action,
collected 17 and was by far the leading
scorer for the teamr He felt that Grinnell
could have scored more, explaining,
“They were running a real controlled of-
fense. We just didn't get the ball,"

In addition, poor conversion of offensive
rebounds kept the Pioneers lrom pulling
away early on. Coach John Harvey
agreed, saying, “We missed some easy
shots inside and that Could have given us
more of a pad." Grinnell’s big men, Jim
Niemeyer and Tim Dick, could manage 0n,
ly four conversions from the field between
them all game. and all those were in the
first half.

Niemeyer's points came at the lirst hall
buzzer on a breakaway slam dunk that
roused the crowd after a fairly slow half
Niemeyer has had several opportunities to
“do the jam" this year but often hobbled
the ball or mlstimed the shot, so Harvey
Said afterwards, “I'm glad he finally got
one" The basket made the score 26-23 at
halftime,

Grinnell appeared to be putting the
game away with a 40-33 lead and about six
minutes left in the game. The Pioneer
deiense, led by a fired-up John Kispert,
was doing a good job of keeping the Rams
from getting inside for easy layups and of

Grinnell trailed with less than two min-
tues left, but several Cornell torus, usually
on pick, provided the Pioneers with oppor-
tunltles to stay close. Unlortunately,
Dick‘s lree throw shooting soured alter he
converted both of his chances in the first
half, and Cornell maintained a slim one»
point lead.

The sevenpoint lead dwindled quickly
as several fouls underneath the Cornell
basket and clutch shooting from the line by
the Rams turned the tide against lrom the
pioneers.

Blyly was presented with a one-and-one
situation inside a minute left though, and
