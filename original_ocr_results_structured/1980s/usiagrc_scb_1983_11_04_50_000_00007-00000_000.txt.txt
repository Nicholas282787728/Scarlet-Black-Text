The seneschal of the College of Gnomountai'n speaks

SCA: A special report

by M. Wolfgang Schumann

“it’s only at a college campus that you
get the sustained level of craziness,” says
Lord Andrixos Seljukroctonis, Seneschal
of the College of Gnomountain, “that you
need to keep this kind ol thing going."

He’s talking about the Society for
Creative Anachronism, a group tormed in
1966 to give participants a chance to
escape the mundane tor a chance to live
the medieval life for a while. A dozen
fighters attended that first tournament.
Six weeks later, just before the second
event, science fiction writer Marion Zim-
mer Bradley gave the lledgling organiza-
tion its unusual name. By 1981, according
to Smithsonian magazine, paid member-
ship in SCA was up to 5000.

Andrixos, a Seneschal of the College. is
the chief legal officer at his organization, a
public-relations man, the “person in
charge of general headaches." I-Lis duties
include mostly the writing of reports and
records, dealing with the public, and set
ting up group events.

What the Society does is not always what
the public sees, explains Andrixos, who
often goes under the alias “Steve Boyd."
Most outsiders think of the SCA as the peo-
ple who go out and pretend to kill each
other for fun. This, he admits, is partially
true; but only fifteen of the thirty-live ac-
tive or semi-active members of Gnomoun-
tain, Grinnell's chapter of the Society. aCr
tually do any fighting at all, “mough the
thing that most people see is die fighting.
The group here is unfortunately centered
a little too much around lighting. It‘s the
easiest thing to do.”

Besides mock combat, other activities in
which Society members participate in-
clude calligraphy, music, and costuming,
among others, Andrixos makes armor in
his spare time. “It’s like knitting 7 you

Cross country teams to

compete this weekend

From College News Service

The Grinnell College women’s cross
Country team is favored to reclaim the
Midwest Conlerence championship after
two years as runner-up.

The issue will be decided tomorrow
when Coe hosts the sow-meter race at
Cedar Rapids. It will begin at 11 a.m,

“I’m cautiously optimistic about our
chances for the title," says Pioneer Coach
Evelyn Freeman, who sees Beloit and Cor-
nell as tough competitors. “We can win it,
but it will take a good effort from all of our
runners."

Grinnell Captured the 1978, 1979,3nd1980
crowns, but placed second to Cornell in
both 1981 and 1982‘

Boasting four of the first five placers,
Grinnell easily captured a 4-wam meet
hosted by Monmouth last weekend. The
Scarlet and Black had an [358 margin
over second place Knox.

“l was pleased with our performance,”
Freeman said, “We had trained hard the
previous week in preparation for the con-
ference meet, but still ran well at Mon-
mouth.”

Shavaun Adams was the individual win-
ner, covering the 2 mile course in 12: 9.
Andrea Straight was second in 12:
Susan Durkee third in 12: 30, Annette
Campbell fifth in 12: S7, and Jennifer
Bishop seventh in 13: 15.

Ray obermiller is hoping for a first divI~
sion berth when he takes his Grinnell Col-
lege men’s cross country team to Cedar
Rapids tomorrow for the Midwﬁt Con-
ference Meet.

Coe will host the 8000-meter event at
11:45 a in.

pected to battle lor the crown as the loop

tion.

watch TV and knit chain mail.” It takes up
to six months to make a good set of armor.
While the weapons that Society fighters
use are blunted and deSlgned not to kill, it
is still all too easy to get bruised badly in
combat.

Most of the members of the College of
Gnomountain are students at Grimell Col-
lege, although there are some local
residents, and one faculty member, Kevin
Crimm. Gnomountain is unusal in that it is
one of the only ten or so Colleges of the
Societ that is so centered around

students. Most groups are based in larger
towns and attract mainly adults ol ages
25-30

Gnomountain members attend “tour-
naments” and “revels" held by other
groups about every other weekend in
season. Two weeks ago, on 22 October, the
local group hosted the “Third Annual Gno-
mountain Tournament and Melees " One
hundred SCA members from Iowa,
Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, and
Wisconsin attended. Thirty-five fighters
participated overall, and there were con-
tests also in Calligraphy, lllumnination,
Brewing and Archery.

Critics say that the SCA, especially its
emphasis on combat, promotes violence
and militarism as fun. Andrixos disputes
that, “It is militaristic the same way that
chess is. We emphasize the chivalry, the
lair play of lighting. [It’s] far enough
removed from today’s reality to be
unrealistic. We look at it as a test of
skill; it is, in fact, very close toasport We
look at this as a possible-outlet," he ex-
plains.

GDod conduct and service to the
kingdom presented Andrixos with an
Award of Arms at the tournament two
weeks ago Now he has earned the title
“Lord” and is allowed to use a coat of
arms. There is a whole aristocratic struc-
ture built into the Society, with ranks all
the way up to King and Queen Each
kingdom covers a section of the United
States and is further divided into smaller
regions, each of which has its. own
medieval- sounding name.

To Andrixos, Society members area t as
crazy as they are often made to be “We re
really Just a big group of friends that
travels together every other weekend. , . to
live a slightly different life,"

Lake Forest last Saturday in the Midwest
Conlerence championship playoff game.

Lake Forest, which copped the North

very few offensive threats," noted Coach
John Pfitsch.

He praised the defensive work of goalie
Greg Donovan and tuilhacks Chip Maxson,
Chris Cans, Henry-York Steiner, Rob
Curley and Adam Brent.

Grinnell captured the South Division tit:
