A Grinnell gridder tells all
”On the road again"

by Greg Moore

It is noon on Friday, Oct. 1, and the scene
is a familiar one: people dressed in
Grinnell football sweats loading equip
ment, sack lunches and themselves into it
dusty white bus.

Alter everything is loaded. the coach
takes roll call, the door swings shut and the
diesel starts is familiar roaring and
belching of black smoke. The sounds and
smells of the bus will occupy us for the
next ﬁve hours as we head for Beloit. Wis .
to play Beloit College on Saturday

We are “on the road again." But what
does that mean for as players four
coaches, a manager, camera operator.

Theroad trip begins with the long ride to
the hotel. if one has not had the foresight to
visit Peppercorn's prior to leaving. he
must suffer through prepacked Cowles

hours. To begin with, most players come

economics or whatever. Assignements do
not stand still for road trips.

lf one’s homework for the weekend Is
light, there are other ways of diverting
cne's attention. For example, Head Coach
Ed Dombrowski is always willing to try his
best to defeat anyone in a game of hearts

Having previously defeated the coach at
his favorite game, I found myself engaged
in conversation with Coaches John Mara
tinek and Will Freeman and several
Pioneer playels. Martinek and Freeman n
were more than happy to talk at length
about some of the subjects they teach, in»
cluding general anatomy and
biomechanics; several of us learned how
Grinnell obtains and uses its cadavers.

later, the coaches asked some (If us
about our studies and our respective
graduate school plans. It is more than
likely that, had we gone to larger schools
to play football, we would have been
unable to enjoy the exchange since
coaches are not usually professors and
trips are of a much more serious nature

The trip turns serious, though. as we
reach Beloit College. The team unloads
and begins the final practice routine
Special teams, offensive work and
defensive plans are reviewed, and we are

Coach John Pfitsch. “We had no offense
and no defense." Rex Osae notched the
Pioneer goal late in the first half after Cor-
nell had taken a 270 lead.

On Saturday, the Scarlet and Black re-
bounded ior a 570 romp over Monmouth
and evened their divisional record at 1-1.
Jim Indiveri collected two tallies and Eric
Pedicini, John Gerry and Osae each
scored once.

“We played tairly well against a young
and inexperienced Monmouth team and
controlled the ball in their half of the field
most of the time,” Pfllsch noted.

A 1-0 loss to Chicago followed on Sunday.
“Except lor scoring, we played our best
soccer of the season in the Chicago game,"
Pfitsch declared. “Our defense was
organized, we had a good attack, controll-
ed the ball more than Chicago did, and had
some good shots that just missed going
in."

The game was decided by a shoot out
when neither team scored during regula-
tion time and two overtime sessions. Both
teams made four or five penalty kicks in
the shoot out. In a sudden death shoot out
that followed, both tams made their first
shot. Chicago also made its second shot
and won the game by a H) score when
Grinnell missed its second attempt.

passing game this week.

Beloit. boasting an offensive line that
averages 240 pounds from end to end,
simply overpowered the Pioneers last
week. The Bucs ran for loo yards and col-
lected all five of their touchdowns on the
ground.

The Scarlet and Black quickly grabbed a
