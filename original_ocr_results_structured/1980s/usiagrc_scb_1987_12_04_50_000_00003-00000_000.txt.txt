Life on the farm

by Andrew J. Hamilton

You may recall a survey that
was sent around last year; it
was looking for students inter-
esterl’iit living oil a local faint
for asentester, This was the
beginning of the Griltnell rtu.
fol Program, designed by the
Griuuell College Housing Com»
mittee. The program is de-
signed to give students rt taste
of what it is like to live on Lt
farm. This semester, the pro-
grain left tlte planning stage
and was applied. Front October
28 to November '20, Anu- Brtl-
sltisei and Cindy Rybolt were, iii
eirect, “exchange students" on
Grinnelivarea farnts. Although
they still went to their classes on
campus, they stayed with their
liost'fznnilies iii the afternoons
and nights

C'intly stayed on the 800-2tcre
beef cattle faint of Helen and
Robert Renaud and their son,
Brent, Planning oit studying in
France. Cindy thought tlte Rn»
ml Program might be. a “good
way to get used to uhnt it‘s like
to live witlt a host foniily. She
nlso Wanted to get a view of
the college from without. Site
is from a tanning conuuunity in
Indiana, so she knew what to ex
pect. Cindy felt distanced from
the cantpus when she wns on the
innit and site said, “In doing it
I‘ve found that I don‘t want to
live ot'thainpus.“

However, she still enjoyed the
experience and described the
farm as having a “nice, lltid-
bat-k atmosphere. Cindy felt
that the farm acti ities (not re-
quired of the student) were a
bit beyond her. and said that
”they were big projects like her
vesting and building ieuee
So, beyond witnessing a tiirkey~
butchering. she did ltot pursue
the chore aspect offarin life: lli-
stead, Cindy focused on the host
family, She became close to her
host family and said, “I think
I've been ntothered more in the
last three weeks than I have itt
my life.“ Slle added, “I imagine
that I'll keep ilt touch with the
family."
“I dou’t think I could ever see
myself on a farm," 51!? believes
the program “was worth it."

Although Cindy saith.

‘ Ann ‘ stayed witlt Howard and
Siizy Ralrety on their aioeacie

to learn of the ditrerent lifestyle
and said, “I was curious about

of this." Ann~ said she was not
at all disappointed and felt right
at home on the family form, Site
jumped right iitto the work of
the farm chores Site “liked to
feed the steers" and drive the:
fan“ equipment. Said Ann»,
“it's all new. . .I like it a lot,"

Ann' learned a great dent
about farm life iii general and a
bit about herself. She said, ”it
takes a special type of person to
do this kind ofthittg. It's a lot of
work." But she is quick to add
the positive sid “The air is so
much cleaner .I’nt iii a better
emotional stdte,,.l get excited
when t have to go back tto the
failn)."

Anni likes the fact that oil the
form one can see the results of
one‘s work. She contrast; this
to college work in which progress
is much harder to judge in roll»
crete terms. Anne found the
ex erience so positive and ins
spiring that she is thinking se—
riously about eventually going
into fanning herself. “it's a
hard life," she said, “but fun,“

would like to have gone for o.
seinester.. Other than that. l
have no negative feelings about

Both Anne and Cindy XL"
ported thnt, in general, they
had positive feelings about their
experiences. Both students
stressed the need for commits
nteiit by the student for the pro-
gruin to he successful. Cindy
felt tlint she “wasn‘t spending
enough time anywhere (on the
farm or on campus)" Anne
added, “Anyone who does this
should make sure they have the
time."
