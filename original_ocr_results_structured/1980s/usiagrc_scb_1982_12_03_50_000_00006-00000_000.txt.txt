Midnight Express — (1978, 120 min.) This
film, directed by Alan Parker and starring
Brad Davis, is this weekend’s best bet.
Based on an autobiographical account by
an American college student, Billy
Hayes, it is the story or Hayes’ experiences
in a Turkish prison and his subsequent
escape. Caught trying to smuggle two kilos
of hashish from Istanbul, Hayes was
sentenced to 30 years in the brutal Turkish
penal system. Torture, betrayal and tore
ment characterize his experiences during
his incarceration.

While the film is an attempt to make a
convincing political statement, its effec—
tiveness is hindered by overdramtic
scenes which embellish on the true facts of
Hayes' experiences as well as the
gruesome scenes of violence which at
times are more of a distraction than a con,
vincing means to protest the Turkish penal
system. In additionythe only sympathetic
characters in the film are Western, and
this bias serves to further undermine the
iilm's credibility as a platiorm ror social
change.

Dupite ﬂiese shortcomings, however,

the ﬁlm does manage to retain the essence
of the social problem at hand. Davis is con-
vincing in his role and his performance
gives to the film the honesty which is miss-
ing in other areas.
Mary Poppins — (1964, 139 min.) This
musical Version of P.L. Traver's Mary
Poppins books, stars Julie Andrews and
Dick Van Dyke. The film, which takes
place in pre-World War 1 England, is the
story or the experiences or an upperrclass
English family after the unexpected arr
rival ot Mary Poppins.

This production may be considered by
some as a children's film, but a closer look
reveals uie presence of a number oi social
and political issues or the period in
England which marks the beginning or the
death of liberalism. The experiences and
attitudes of the “suffragette” mother and
her husband, a bank president, as well as
the cockney artist beiriended by Poppins
all serve to demonstrate this point.

The musical numbers of this film are
wellrknown, and with good reason, From
the lively “Spoonful of Sugar" to the poig-
nant “Feed the Birds,” every song in the
production is periormed With expertise
and vigor,

While the film may, at times, border on
the saccharine, delightful acting as well as
these expertly produced musical numbers
make it a “true classic" well worth seeing.
The Circle 0| Iron — (1979, 102 min ) AC-
cording to Playboy, “The Circle or iron is
the definitive martial arts movie.” With an
allrstar cast featuring Jeff Cooper, Roddy
McDowell, Elia Wallach, Christopher Lee
and eXrKulig-fu Tv star Davis Caradine,
this film offers a blend of Kungrfu and Zen
mysticism'in the tradition of martial arts
adventure originally made popular by
Bruce Lee and James Coburn.

The story is oi an arena lighter's guest
for the Book or Enlightenment and the
hardships he encounters in this search.
The Circle of iron is full of spectacular
Kung-fu battles and mysterious Oriental
adventure. while this iilm may not appeal
to all students, this is a mustrsee for all
fans of action films and martial arts en-
thusiasts.

Put on your Dancing Shoes
The Waltz to be an 'Eleganf Affair'

Billed as an “elegant affair”, this year's
Waltz, to be held Saturday night at 9:30,
promises to be an enjoyable change or
pace from standard all-campus weekend
events,

Plans for the Waltz, organized by Stu-

dent Coordiantor Jon Scharff and Midis-:-

tant Student Coordinator Kathy Zimmerr
man, have been weeks in the making.

This is thersecond-year'that the Waltz
has been held in Darby Gymnasium,
previous Waltzes have taken place in
Quad. However, according to Scharff, the
popularity oi the event has necessitated
the use oi a larger facility.

Despite the usual stark and drab look of
Darby, decorations designed by Zimmer-
man promise to provide a romantic at-
mosphere appropriate to the event,

Red, white and black heliumafilled
balloons will abound, with clusters of
balloons attached to the floor of the gym-
nasium to create an eﬂ’ieral effect. Accor-
ding to Zimmerman, this arrangement of
balloons will also serve to separate the
dance floor from the rest oi the gym-
nasium.

department, will further enhance the at

provided by a reel-to—reel recording of

chestras.
