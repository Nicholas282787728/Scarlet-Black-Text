from you at dinner is holding a gun on his
lap.

My fourteen~year—old iriend on the kibv
but: might never have owned a gun had he
remained in the United States, As an
Israeli boy he did not understand why
there is a movement in America to ban
handguns.

After completing my three weeks oi ar-
my duty. I left the base to study Hebrew in
Jerusalem for the rest of the summer. Ar-
riving at Hebrew University. I en-
countered a completely different set of cir-
cumstances. The students from the year
before were in the midst of their final ex-
am month. Each exam is offered several
times during that month to allow students
who were called out for reserve duty to
make up an exam. Thus. if a student failed
an exam the first time he also had a
chance to take the exam again.

If the Israeli students often seemed
more mature or more serious than the
Americans. it was due to the differences in

‘ from page 2
our age. Most of the students had already
completed their army service, so they
were at least two to three years older than
the incoming American and Canadian
studens. Also. the Israelis had chosen a
major before they entered the University
and so the degree they would receive from
the school more closely resembled a
Masters than an American Bachelor of
ArLs.

By the end of my summer, I had come to
an understanding of some of the major dit—
lerences between what my life had been
like in the United States and what it could
have been like had my family stayed in
Israel. I also gained an understanding of
what complete conscription does to a coun-
try in terms of relationships. sexism. fear
of war. and fear of guns. It was definitely
a positive experience and one day I plan to
go back to try and give what I can of
myself to a country where I can truly say~
I belong.

 

Stereotypes

salespeople. Looking back on it. I fell the
israeli men were not purposely being ex-
tremely forward. but in their culture. most
women are not friendly with complete
strangers. One acts more cautiously. even
somewhat coldly After i got to know some
Israelites better. I found them to be warm
and sincere.

The Hebrew word for someone who was
born in Israel. ”Sabra”. reinforces this
value system that says one should not be

from Page 2
too friendly until one gets to know the other
person better. Sabra means literally,
“prickly on the outside and sweet on the in
side," Israelis have had to struggle to keep
Israel alive. and this has influenced their
outlook on relations with other people.
Smiling and being friendly and open to
perfect strangers are generally considered
good character traits in America. while to
some Israeli men. this kind of behavior is a
Sign of invitation.

childrern. but olten, too, women who have
been abused in the past tend to marry men
who are abusive The woman in the ins
troduction. for instance. had been abused
as a child and had been married for five
years in a previous marriage in which she
was also the victim of violence.

Knierim emphasized the need for both
women and men to go to the Mental Health
Center [or counseling.

Once couples or individuals come to the
center. counselors work to help them
understand their' problems and the alter»
natives available to them. Building self-
esteem in abused women is essential. and
although trying to keep the family intact is
important. Knierim concedes that
sometimes splitting it up is necessary.

Uniortunately. people consider'the
center as a place for “crazy" people. she

said

The problem of domestic violence also
extends to Grinnell College. although DVA
has not dealt with many cases with
students. Since Iowa law describes
domestic Violence as verbal or physical
abuse between individuals who live
together. it applies to roommates as well
as families,

The college’s resident adviser/student
advisor counseling structure takes care of
most problems that arise at the college.
However. both organizations want to get
the college more involved in trying to solve
domestic violence. Involvement can ins
elude counseling for those who want help.

College in Texas. -

In addition to serving as a bond between
alumni and the college. Mears “serves to
remind us" that the college was a “pioneer
institution" in higher education for
women. Jordan said. Meal-s was one of the
first college residence halls for women
west of the Mississippi.

However. “Mears [also] serves to re»
mind us of past inequities and educational
philosophies we no longer want to retain,"
he said.

Jordan explained that the “cottage" was
purposely designed to be more like a home
than a residence hall because. in the words
of former President Main. “girls should
and must be homemakers." It was felt that
women “should not learn how to behave
downtown or in the union or in the gym-
nasium but in a home." he said.

Jordan also noted that it is “ironic" that
although the hall was named to honor alum
Mary Grinnell Mears. she is thus
“remembered by her husband's name.”

Currently. Mears houses the offices of

of these issues is essential; the first step is
to become informed. A person's career
