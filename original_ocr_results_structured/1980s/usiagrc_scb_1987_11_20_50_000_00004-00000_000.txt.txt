Today’s disrespect,

To the Editor.

I would like It) thank everyone
who was involved in tho Speakeasy
and the open iorum tor dealing
with the issue of racism In such a
positive way, and tor sharing your
personal ideas and ieelings so true-
ly with the rest of us

Al both the Speakeasy and the
open iorum Dave white and a low
others made an important distinc-
lion when Lhey identified racial
problems among Grinnetl students
as primarily problems oi igr
norance rather than racism
Racism. as distinguished irom ig-
ncrance. is not a very big problem
at Grinnell. This is not because
Grinnellians are more open-
minded. liberal, or respectful than
others (in many ways we simply
are not). Rather, we just don't
have much opportunity to treat one
another in overtly racist ways. We,
as students. are rarely iorced to
work together on group projects,
and we generally are not put in
positions or authority over one
another, We don't hire or fire other
students; we don’t determine pay
scales; and we don't have our Stu»
dent Advisors “writing-up" other
students ior breaking rules. We are
basically “sell-employed"
students, and while the potential
ior overt racism is certainly here,
the outlets are few in our environ
ment.

in all the cases oi "campus
racism” brought up during the
Speakeasy and open forum, .one
common raptor was present. While
some “racism" involves one's
iailure to recognize and respect
another's unique cultural identity
leg. “I’m tired ol ieeling like I
have in art while"). and nther ins

racism

stances occur when one assumes
that another must necessarily
share in a particular cultural or
ethnic characteristic leg ”Don't
assume that l speak Black
English”). |n all oi these cases it is
a lack oi the most basic human
respect that results in pain and
resentment. As Sylvaih Boko

pointed out, it is not what one asks

but how one asks that makes a
racial or cultural question ol'l'enr
sive. within a relationship oi
mutual respect no question can be
racist. When a white person asks
Sylvain, "Hey, how's lite in the
jungle?" this is obviously
disrespectiul and should not be
tolerated. Similarly, when a black
woman addresses a crowd in the
iorum saying, “You whites don't
have to worry about ‘Jae Shmoe'
keeping his job. this is also exr
pressing an offensive lack oi
respect iparticularly ior white
male iaculty to whom she reiersi.

while true racism may be hard
to find among our student body.

disrespect ior others litters the ~

campus. Certain privileged groups
are never to be lound near the end
oi a dinner line at Cowles or Quad
7 their time is apparently much
more valuable than everyone
else's. People with “superior"
taste in music (and superior
stereos) determine what music the
entire dorm must listen to at any
given time. Others oi “extraors
dinary intelligence and insight"
take the microphone out oi turn in
a moderated discussion because
their views and opinions have
more merit than others who have

To the Editor:

This is to draw the attention ol
r iellow Grinnellians to the crimes ol
the right-wing military regime ol
Bangladesh. Recently thousands oi
political activists have been ar-
