Ashes and Diamonds

by Agnieszka Rysinska

“Ashes and Diamonds." a Iambus Polish
ﬁlm made in 1957, was director Andrzej
WaJda‘s third and most important iilm.
Based on a novel by Jerzy Ahdrzejewski,
“Ashes and Diamonds” rellects on the
complicated postwar era. The end of the
war signals the advent of a new Come
munist government which eiiects enorr
mous changes in the structure oi the socie-
ty and in its ideals and morals.

"Ashes and Diamonds” is set in the Spr-
ing of 1945, the day alter the liberation of a
provincial town. Within the frame of 24
hours we are introduced to two contrasting
figures: Maciek, a member of the anti-
Communist underground, and Szczuka,
the new Communist Party secretary who
has been ordered assassinated by the
resistance. To reveal the turbulent mood
oi the country, two parties are shown, one
celebrating the end oi occupation, the
other heralding “liberation.”

Like many other Polish l'iims, “Ashes
and Diamonds” has several levels. We
see a thriller, a tragedy of fate, and a
historic account, but also a social and
political comment about a great struggle

that was continuing when the movie was
made. Because at this, heated debate
iollowed the film's release as it was accus-
ed at being an anachronism portraying the
year 1958, not 1945. All sides assumed the
main characters were representative or
the government and its opposition, and the
balance between these two characters in
the plot was criticized. Although Wajda’s
iilm did not iollow the socialistic standard
or the time, the tone is neither bitter nor
hostile. but rather conveys an awareness
oi a great drama that took place.

“Ashes and Diamonds" has been
criticized also ior a reeling oi hopelessness
and iatalism, stemming irom the tradition
oi Polish literature in the 19th century, this
attitude reilects a philosophy oi martyr-
dom oi the nation, imploying, as well, the
martyrdom and rebellion oi the individual

Another criticism oi Wajda's directing
style lies in his concern tor detail and
beauty ior their own sake (some critics
dubbed this baroque), but this gives you
Just one more reason to go and see this
great film.

it seems like Good Fortune has bestowed
our iair institution with the showing or the
Woody Allen iilm "Bananas," in the time»

this showing coincides nicely with Allen's
recent appearance on the cover oi Rolling

edit this cvent into their publicity video
and attract those quality students we so
desperately desire

Actually. "Bananas” is not all that great
of a iilm ll Woody Allen‘s name were not
tacked on, its appeal would drop irom its
social status height to a non-important
slab oi celluloid, Sprinkled with hilarious
sight gags and dialogue. “Bananas" pro
vides adequate bits oi humor, but il rails to
devclop into a cohesive string oi digestible
story line. Clearly this comic insanity is in
spired by the Marx Brothers, whom Alien

Birdy

by Brian Stl'ause

“You ever been to Philly?" Al asks Bir-
dy's Army doctor. "You have to be pretty
crazy to live there " You too would have to
be “pretty crazy" not to love this iilm. a
true cinematic masterpiece

Director Alan Parker manages to allow
the complex personalities of both Al
(Nicholas Cage) and Birdy (Matthew
Modine) to surface in this story or the
twisted results of a few years of hell in Viet
Nam. We meet Birdy, who is in a psychotic
state at a prisonlike veterans hospital,
cooped up in a room that could only en-
courage psychosis, not cure it.

The immediate cause oi Birdy’s condi-
tion is the viet Nam experience, an ex-
perience in hindsight he should never have
been forced to endure. Al, too, suifered ins
Juries in the war, His scars however, only
appear as physical ones. it is Al's sense or
sanity which provides a basis tor the air
tempted revival oi his lriend Birdy. Al
tries to lead an unresponsrve Blrdy down
memory lane in an effort to shake his bud:
