Scarlet 8: Black

How legal was Mr. Reaganis little war ?

by Stephen Meehan

During the early morning hours of Oct.
25, 1983, United States Marines and Army
, rangers invaded Grenada, a small island
in the Caribbean, crushing the leftist
regime of Bernard Coard, the leader of a
succasful coup on the island earlier in OC-
tuber. The primary objective of the mis-
sion, according to President Reagan, was
to rescue from the island 1,000 US,
citizens, mostly medical school students,
whose lives were thought to be en»
dangered. The secondary goal was to
restore democracy to the island. Reaction
to the invasion was negative in Europe and
in the Soviet Union, but at home the
response was just the boost the Praident
needed. His popularity soared. According
to a “New York Times”/CBS News Poll
taken right after the invasion, 55 percent of
the country supported the action, The
shock the country experienced following
the murder of 250 marines in Lebanon was
instantly turned into national pride, a
result of our military victory.

The action was a success. The United
States showed the world 7 especially the
Soviets, Cuba and Nicaragua 7 who is in
charge in the Western Hemisphere and
what could happen to those who threaten
this position The action was a big boost for
our national ego, but it is time now to
realize the price we paid at home ior Mr.
Reagan's war. By sending troops into
Grenada, he not only sacrificed the lives oi
18 Americans, but he also exceeded the
limits of his presidential authority to carry
out a military action. His invasion order
violated the War Powers Resolution pass-
ed by Congress in 1973 None of the reasons
for the invasion given by ,the president

justify troop deployment as specified by
the resolution. By ignoring the law and ac
ting without approval from Congress, Mr.
Reagan has set a dangerous precedent by
which further abuses of the presidency
could threaten survival of our present Con-
stitution.

The War Powers Resolution addressﬁ
the conditions in which the President can
deploy troops.

The constitutional powers of the
President as Commander-in-
Chief to introduce United States
Armed Forces into hostilities, or
into situations where imminent
involvement in hostilities is
clearly indicated by me cir»
cumstances, are exercised only
pursuant to (1) a declaration of
war, (2) specific statutory
authorization, or (3) a national
emergency created by attack
upon the United States, its ter»
ritories, or its armed forces.

We were not at war with Grenada and
the President certainly did not have
specific statutory authorization to invade.
In the case of the Grenadan invasion, only
a handful of the most powerful Congres-
sional leaders knew of the project and only
after the final decision had been made.
Above all, the resolution makes no provi-
sion for conditions when the lives of
American civilians overseas are being
threatened,

Aiter the invasion was well under way,
reports from the White House and Defense
Department informed the public that
Soviet advisers and Cuban soldiers and
workers had been captured, along with an

Dunn Hill should
be extinguished

by Joe Lung

Dunn Hill is a menace. I came to this as-
tounding concluSIon the other night in a
computer terminal room, llt's location
will remain anonymous in order to protect
the real identity of Dunn Hill, who, incredir
ble as it sounds, is a good friend of mine)
As I entered the room, smoke gushed into
my lace. Needless to say, this was quite
bothersome to me. i had had only two
hours oi sleep in the last two days and my
contact lcnses were bothering me. Mental-
ly and physically exhausted, I mustered
enough courage to demand that Mr. Hill
cease smoking He responded with various
bogus excuses, which gave him time to
suck the cigarette to its ilamlng rilter
Satisfied that he got his money's worth. he
proceeded to blow the smoke into my iace.
End of Act 1.

Later on that night. I was working on an
assignment in another computer room
tthis one, by the way, was smoke-free), It
had, in other words, not seen the likes of a
‘Dunn Hill', Act ll, Scene I (Note [0 the
reader: 1, Joe Lung, am not a Theatre ma
jor but an Economics major, as my
faultless reasoning below will prove to
everyone’s satisfaction. This includes Mr
Reid, my advisor ) When lVlJ‘ Hill entered
the room, I made it clear to him that I
would not tolerate his smoking. He im-
lnediately erupted into a rage similar to
the initial flame that his matches produce.
The color of his face can only be described
as that of the red hot burning tobacco
iound in one or his imported cigarettes Ile
said, and I quote, "i am sick and tired oi
your complaining," I responded in a civil
manner and explained to him that it was
iic who was infringing upon my rights and

not the opposite A long and loud argument
ensued, highlighted by Mr. Hill's unbe-
llevable digressions from the topic of
individual rights in nonsmoking areas and
how they had to be adhered to at all times
whether or not solneone was in the room,
in an effort to refute one oi my well are
ticulated and reasoned points, Mr Hill
responded that the issue was moot because
he was going to give up smoking in a few
days Ias if this was to prove that he is a
considerate human beingi, Coupled with
this irrelevant statement, Mr Hill VOlCed
his utter disapproval of the fact that the
Scarlet and Black did not give equal time
to the American Tobacco Institute. This
comment referred to the American Cancer
Society's Great American Smokeout ad in
last week's issue,

The argument went on and on, so we
decided to put our comments into print. He
will respond to my airtight, witty points in
next week's issue of the 5&8. This paper
will be a forum [or a debate of smokers'
rights versus those of the noble none
smokers, rather than an instrument of
Dunn i-lill's personal aggrandizement Ii
you agree with my posttion, please icel
free to drop a note in the shill addressed to
‘Joe Lung‘ it you attach a cigarette or do
some other sort of immature prailk like fill
the envelope with ashes, I WILL NOT
TAKE YOUR COMMENTS SERIOUSLY
in my column.

Until next time, happy breathing
[without smoke). And remember, true
pleasure is in the lines and pain imposed
upon those who smoke in restricted areas,

impressive cache of Soviet arms and
secret documents, The Defense Depart-
ment questioned the intended use of the
nearly completed, 10,000 loot airstrip be
ing built by Cubans, tying it to military
purposes, The Amercian press began to
ponder the real reasons for the invasion as
more evidence of Cuban investment in the
island was exposed. What had started as a
mercy mission was now an action to
squash Soviet and Cuban expansion in the
Caribbean. Following the coup, Mr. Coard
expressed to the press his fears of an inva-
slon by the United States. The United
States had carried out two mock invasions
of islands similar in topography to
Grenada in the last two years, Just before
the invasion, the Cubans reportedly moved
forces off the island because of the
possibility of an attack. Aware that the
Cubans and Grenadans were preparing ior
an invasion, why did the President not go
to Congress and get approval for the ac-
lion? Obviously, the element oi surprise
was not there, and by gaining Congres
sional authorization, he would have exer-
cised his constitutional responsibilities
and would have had the support of a united
nation behind him He did go to Congress,
but only after the invasion, The only deci»
sions to be made 'were those concerning
the extent of U,S presence after the fact.

By avoiding the constitutional process,
Mr. Reagan has illustrated to the
American public and the rest of the world
the ease with which powercan be controll-
ed by one branch oi our government. A
similar scenario occured in the US a
decade ago. During the Nixon Administra~
tion, the president decided he was above

Opinion

by Ian MCLean

Students are being hurt In every institu-
tion oi higher learning in America. at-
tempts are being made by the federal
government to force students to conform
to select political‘ ideals through
blackmail I refer to the Solomon Amend
lnent, which demands proof of Selective
Service registration as a prerequisite ior
federal financial aid to students. Whethci
one is ior or against Selective Service, one
can only be appalled at this latest attempt
to iorce the will of a political group on
American students

Most of the debate raging around the
Solomon Amendment centers on a sympr
tom, not a cause People, tor the lnost part,
seem to condemn the Solomon Amend-
ment for its eflects But what about the
principle that the amendment rCsIs on 7 is
it not wrong as well? it is amazing that the
debate has scarcely touched on the Central
issue of the Solomon Amendment. Why
Should the national government be able to
concern itself with the politics of American
students- in the first place?

The answer may seem cold. but it is, unr
iortunately. eminently logical‘ it is their
money: it is the nature of federal aid
Arguments about taxation and the lemon
siveness or government policy aside, it is a
sad fact that the government is only doing
to America's college students what it has
been doing to the republic‘s private institu7
tions and constituent states for years 7 en7
iorcing the iiat of the national government
through the blackmail of federal aid Why
is the speed limit set at 55 mph? why is
there a right turn on red" Because the
states did not want to lose federal highway
funds Why do colleges rearrange their ad»
miss‘ions standards and businesses their
hiring policies to meet the dictates oi an
unelectcd nalional official? They do so
because of the threatened loss of federal
aid or busmess contracts.

To most Gi‘innell Students (indeed, to
most of America) such arm~lwisting has
gone by the boards without so much as a
raised eyebrow. This is because, so iar,
such clumsy attempts at social reform

the law and his staii, mistaking loyalty to
the Presidency for loyalty to the Presi-

. dent, supported him. Watergate shattered

the public’s opinion of the oifice oi Presi7
dent. In the Grenada incident, Mr Reagan
may too have gone above the law; the
system which allows such abuses to occur
must be altered

Mr, Reagan‘s actions have endangered
the legitimacy of the Constitution, expos-
ing just how vulnerable that piece of paper
is when the words on it are ignored, We are
lucky that the framers of the Constitution
made provisions so that gaps in the laws
could be filled to better protect the
freedoms of this nation In ihe Nov IA
issue, the editors of the “New Yorker” sucr
cinctly summarized the implications of the
PrESident’s actions:

In this new reality, the President
acts alone, and no one else has a
voice7not Congress, not the
prﬁs, not the public. All these
parties, who are caught up in the
consequences oi the decision they
had no part in making, are left to
respond as best they can to the
fail accompli. The President
acts, They only react.

Preventative measures were taken to
ensure that another Watergate will not oc7
cur, this crisis calls for like actions. It is
the responsibility oi the American public
and press to urge the Congress and the
President to cooperate in producing the
necessary safeguards, if we, the public, do
not respond, we cannot predict what
abuses oi this nature a future president
could make. The Constitution can protect
democracy and freedom here at home, but
only if we use it in time.

have been doing the hi" thing. No one,
after all, wants to live in a discriminatory
society, for discrimination is a moral
abomination And 55 saves lives. What is
being made apparent by the Solomon
amendment 7 and painfully so 7 is the
hard knowledge of what exactly is meant
by all this iederal iiscal inachtpolitik: the
alteration oi large and traditionally
private areas of American liie by a
governmental surgeon wielding an ex-
tremely poweriul instrument 7 the
American dollar.

Surely, it can be argued, a taxpayer can-
not be expected to finance schemes which
hurt his interests. This, sadly, is not the
case. it is a principle of government that
minorities may not opt-out ol projects or
”contributions" which benefit society as a
whole (To be sure, the number cl
registration-i-esisters is very large But
congressmen and senators have a
remarkable talent for believing what they
will without recourse to lacts.l Now the
main issue is exposed who decides what
beneﬁts society?

Again, the answer is the government.
Our elections are indirect; they address
many issues ex post lacto, if at all. Thus it
should become clear that the ability of the
government to dictate the actions oi
Americans should be highly restricted and
jealously watChcd in the first plaCe, so that
Centralized government cannot make are
bitrary decisions which coei e Americans
to conform to transitory political causes
cclebrvs But federal aid is adinlnisteicd
iii inst such a fashion by pioiessionzil,
unelected buieauciacies executing the
will or relatively liansitory legislators

Such is the nature of all federal aid Its
iecip m depends upon the iuliilhnent oi
ai bit iyiequuements in the national lI'I'
tercs Ilike a 55 mph speed limit oraccepr
table hiring quotasl. Unloriuilatcly it is in
the purview of the government which
dispenses such benefits to decide which i
quirelncnts are in the national intc'ies
Hence the Solomon Amendment. a simple
even routine, attempt b- the national
government to exercise its ght" to pass
social and political legislation based on a
new principle: one dollar. one vote

if nothing else, the anger and outrage
over the Solomon Amendment pomts out
what conservatives 7 or a small few of
them, at any rate 7 have been saying for
sometime Federal aid is for the most part
an insidious, doubleredged sword The
larger it becomes, the more people it can
wound.
