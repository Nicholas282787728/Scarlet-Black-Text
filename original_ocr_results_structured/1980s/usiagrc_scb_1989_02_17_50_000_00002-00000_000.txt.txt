Student complaints
reverse housing plan

by Stephen Hardwick

After a group of students
protested, the Housing
Committee reversed a decision
that would have recommended
that Main third and fourth be
designated single-sex floors. The
students said that such a
designation would have isolated
Main second, the only floor
accessible by elevator that would
have remained cored. Two
students who are confined to
wheelchairs need Main‘s elevator
to have access to the dorm.

In response to the students"
protests, the committee
recommended that I-Iaines third
and James third be designated as
single~sex. The committee also
recommended that Main continue
to be co-ed. Tom Crady, dean of
Student Affairs, gave final
approval to the revised plan on
Tuesday, Feb. 14.

The Housing Committee had
recommended that Main third and
fourth be designated singlersex
because they believed that those
floors are ideally constructed for
the needs of single-sex housing.
They are the only two adjoining
non-loggia South Campus floors
that have a large number of
doubles. Diane Dougherty,
director of Student Housing, said
placing allrlnale floors above or
below all»female f‘toors ”would

build automatically this
community between the floor
that would allow them not to be
isolated."

Some current Main residents
feared that the sense of
community between the third and
founh floors might isolate second
floor residents, as well as making
Main an unpopular dorm. “It
would make Main a South
Campus Norris. a place nobody
would want to be,” said Steve
Sidor, a resident of Main second.
Because it is the only dorm on
campus that is accessible to
wheelchairs, studcnts confined to
wheelchairs would be forced to
live in it. At a special meeting
of the Housing Committee on
Sunday, Feb. 12, the Main
residents argued that it would be
unfair to force students in
wheelchairs to live on an
unpopular and isolated floor.

Daugherty said that she was
surprised to see the reaction to
the committee's initial decision
to designate Main third and forth
as singlersex. “It was very
different for the Housing
Committee to experience
resistance like that," she said.
Sidor said that Main residents
were treated fairly. “The Housing
Committee was very
understanding," he said.

SCARLET AND [SLACK

February 17, 198‘)

 

by Barbara Brown

This is the first in a series of
articles giving detailed excerpts
from Grinnell College's
Institutional Self Study Report
(Fall 1988) prepared for the North
Central Association of Colleges
and Schools. The Scarlet and
Black periodically will publish
these articles in an effort to
increase campus awareness of the
study and its contents. The study
comprises three volumes, all of
which are on reserve and may be
checked out from both the library
and the Forum desk.

The following are excerpts
concerning the Curriculum
Committee. The first comments
are from “Remarks on the
chcrnuncc of thc Faculty,"
written by Don A. Smith,
professor of history, who was
chair of the faculty from 1986 to
1988. The second set of
quotations are from the “Student
Government Viewpoint of the
Grinnell Administration,“ written
by Ali ElSaffar, who was vice-
president of the Student Gov-
ernment Association from 1986
to 1988.

From Remarks art the
Governance ofthe Faculty. “The
Curriculum Com niittee”:

The Curriculum Committee
discharges its more rcutinc duties .

Smith blasts student input

with which they attend to these
duties.

It nevertheless must bc said that
the Curriculum Commitrcc
diSChargcs feebly and haphazaldly
its more general duties. thc duties
summed up in thc charge of the
Committee "to provide for
continuing study of the educational
effectiveness of the curriculum and
to recommend for its
imprcvcmcnr." That such is the
case is attributable mainly to the
presence of students on the
Committee. 1 havc found mm by
and large students at Grinncll have
an impoverished sense of what
should constitute u baccalaureate
curriculum conceivm of as a whole;
it scarcely extends beyond the idea
[of] a course of study lasting about
cight semesters, chosen by the
students upon the advice of a facr
ulty ndviscr or advisers whom ihc
student finds ccngcnial. With such
a notion of a curriculum. it is not
surprising that, whcn asked to
think or ways to improve the
curriculum of the College, the
typical student member of the Curr
riculum Committee is apt to offer a
bromide such as “improve the
advising system" or "add new
courses" to thc menu already
available. I have more [him cncc
asked student mcmbcrs of the
Curriculum Committcc to ctrcr an
educational defense for requiring a
major, only to and them unable to
do so, cvcn though they maintain
that it is expedient for thc College

. conscientiously, diligently, and
as efficiently as possible as the
vagaries of departmental and
divisional reporting to it will
pcnnit. The student members of thc
Committee particularly deserve
commendation for the seriousness

 

to require a mnjor if only to give
ihc student an academic record
which the outside world will rind
crcuitublc. .

To be sure, the students on the
Curriculum Committee frequently
do have a lively sense of what

constitutes a rigorous major
program of study, and generally
respond favorably to arguments
coming from d.partmcnts and
divisions in favor of changes that
will make departmental majors
marginally mcrc rigorous.
Grinnell students tend to think
departmentally, not
baccalaureately. And so thcy arc

Don Smith

Professor of history

apt to think of proposals to make
degree requirements in general more
rigorous or more demanding as an
imposition upon “student frccdont
to choosc," however
idiosyncratically that may be
defined. Thc result is that student
mcmbcrs of the Curriculum
Committee usually Come to its
meetings welt armed to resist any
modification of “our open
curriculum" by introducing into it
"more structure.“ .(I use current
jargon in the Confident bclicr that
my readers will take my meaning.)
A few faculty members of the
typical Curriculum Committee
generally share the student
satisfaction with the curriculum.
