Carasal Fabrics, which announced its in
tention to go out of business in December,
is only the most recent of a string 01 store
Closures and business failures in the town’
at Grinnell. 7

The most obvious cause of the closings
is, of course, the ailing {arm economy,

“The economy ls deﬁnitely a part of it,”
said Robert Anderson, the town's newly
elected mayor. He acknowledged that
pressure on linancially strapped iarmers
has weakened Grinnell‘s economic base,

However,’ Anderson said complexities
exist beyond the dozen storefronB that
have emptied in the past year. “Right at
the moment, you get a misperception or
what is actually going on," he said.

The mayor cited absentee ownership as
a major iactor in the changes in Grinnell’s
downtown area, He noted that owners
making management decisions irom out
side the community are often less strongly
motivated to maintain a business.

“You just don‘t have the same impetus
to run the business," Anderson said.

As an example, he mentioned Newton
owned D & F Lumber, which closed late
last year.

“We had three lumber yards in town,
and the absentee owner was the one who
left.” he explained.

In other cases, businesses hav left when
displaced by new stores. And rson said
WalMart‘s arrival in town prompted the
owners of Pamida to leave,

, “They didn't feel it was in the cards." he
said.

In at least one instance, concern with
turning a shortrterm proiit has led owners
to set unaffordably high terms for their
busxness tenants.

“He takes too large a share or the

gross,” Anderson said of the owner of a
building in town that has gone through iour
tenants in the past three years,

However, oﬂier towns in Iowa of com-
parable size have fared far worse, Ander-
son said the college has spared the town
much of what other communities have 5us
l‘ered.

“Thank heaven for the college
students,” Anderson said. ”The acollege
has a very strong stabilizing ellect," He
explained that the buying habits or the
relatively well-oil students are constant.

Anderson also referred to several strong
Grinnell industries that have softened the
eiiect oi the depressed larm economy, in-
cluding DeLong's Sportswear and the
Wolverine siding plant.

Generally, Anderson was hopeful about
the town's future. He says the present
economic instability is more an indication
of adjustment than decline. “1 think we're
reaching a point where we may have hit
bottom," he said.

He cited several projects the town has
underway to strengthen their long-term
prospects, including the Grinnell 2000 pro

, gram, and lsu lield study to be conducted
in Grinnnell this semester. and the plann»
ed construction of a new municipal air»
port,

“By hook or by crook, we are going to
survive.” he said. “When you are sinking,
you think at some creative new ways to
swxm."

Empty storefronts inGrinnell

, Darby to

Concert

by John Harrison

Over the last two weeks a dispute has
raged over the location or campus cone
certs. and particularly the Haines Blues
Fest scheduled to be held in Darby Gyme
nasium this Saturday.

Members of the athletic department and
the administration requested an alternate
concert facility to Darby Gymnasium. At
the heart of the dispute IS the protection of
the Darby Gymnasium floor which had
been severely damaged during the
Christmas waltz last semester and cost the
college well over $9300 to repair.

Gar Smith. the mens' basketball team
coach last week expressed a desire to
move all campus concerts out of Darby in
order to protect the basketball court and
ensure that there would be no interruption
in the basketball team‘s home schedule as
a result or a damaged gym iloor,

Smith recalled the difficulties that oc-
curred after the Christmas waltz last
semester when holiday dancers tracked
salt and sand into Darby and scratched the
gymnasium’s iloor.

The desire to protect Darby's floor from
any l‘urther damage prompted many
within the athletic department and the ad
ministration to suggest Quad Dining Hall
as a possible alternative to Darby for all
campus concerts.

Jim Tederman, Dean of Student Affairs.
said. “Quad was suggested as an errort to
protect the‘ iloor ol Darby Gym.” Yet
Tederman went on to say that Quad dining
hall possessed several problems as a con-
cert facility. .

Tederman said, “One, Quad is too small
in per square footage." Tederman pointed
out that bands such as Buddy Guy and
Junior Wells, who are scheduled to play on
Saturday. require large sound and light
systems which are too large for Quad's
rather limited floor space.

'l'ederman also said. “it would take at
least 3 to 4 hours to set up Quad tor a con-
cert,..and this poses many logistical pro~
blems " Tederman stressed that lood ser-
vice at Quad would probably have to be in-
terrupted ii a concert were to be perlorm
cdthere,

By Monday or this week, college oilicials
had settled on the solution to the concert
location problem by agreeing to hold the
Haines Blues ‘Party and all othere parties
at Darby with the iloor covered with a new
sohrl vinyl door mat,

Costing the college $3300 tor the iloor
covering plus the cost or sending BSrG
workers to Philadelphia to select it. the
new vinyl mat offers a solid suriace that
can be taped together.

Tederman believes that this new noel
covering is ideal for dances because itiays
ilat and is resistant to buckling or pulling
apart, Yet Rebecca Quirk, Acting Concert
Committee Chairperson, said that cigarete
tes could not be put out on die new ﬂoor
covering and this would undoubtedly cause
some problems,

in responding to Grinnell College's lack
or acoustically adequate concert tacilities.
Tederman said the college has hired
acoustical experts and has actively under»
taken the task oi improving Darby‘s
acoustics, Tederman said. “By next year.
there will be dramatic acoustical im-
provements in Darby.”

Furthermore. Tederman hinted to the
construction or a new concert iacility be
ing planned where the Pub now stands.
Tederman said that in the event that the
State at lowa raises the drinking age to zl,
both the Pub and Gardner Lounge could be
connected so as to lorm one large concert
hall. But Tederman is quick to stress the
need [or Darhy as a concert facility tor
very large concerts.
