Notes From The Underground l Prepping ISSUE

Last Wednesday night and
Thursday Grinnell was host to
Dan Johnston, national affairs
secretary of the National stu.
dents' association. Hearing him
speak at Student Council and
then meeting him and discuss
sing various matters with him
convinced me more than ever
that Grinnell should rcloin

,his college years gaining knowl-
ledge and insight into those prob-
llems and reserve action for a

All this seems to me to be
rationalization for a security
minded, self-centered fear of
speaking out. I agree that the
prime function of all education
is to supply us with the knowl-
edge that should precede doc
ticn.

At the same time. however,
there are certain ideas which
seem fairly evident to some of
us, and the more we learn the
more we become sure of these
illke the idea that there is no
inequality between men, wo-
men, Negro, white, Christian or
Jew just because of the differ-
ences.

the carrying on of political af—
fairs should be left entirely to
political “experts.” I am a demo-

Our government, as 1 see it.
,is predicated on the assumption

hope that all the "bads" will

the case, but this leads me
again to the conclusion that
students should take an active
,rolc in political leadership.

To return to N,S.A.: through

ert the type of pressure which

ever, Grinnell hesitates to

In fact, in as years of past

college history there has not
been one program with a life
of more than one year. How-
ever, there is one stable insti,

been five years in which the
issue of prepping did not cause

from the first day of school to
the last, with some let-up from
Christmas to spring vacation.
