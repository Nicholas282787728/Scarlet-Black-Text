The loyalty oath and disclaims

‘ack of beliei in our form ot‘
go rnment and in our social
iistitutions it we really believe
in them, we will also believe

will ultimately prove their va—

openly, it we tear counter argus

that is the truth that
evcaled through lree

Vagueiiess
Both the loyalty oath and
disclaimer aiiidavit are am-
biguous, the disclaimer aili-
davit is particularly so. A
lawyer iriend oi mine has
written to a iellow lawyer re—
garding the disclaimer aiiida.
'lt as iollows: “In the iirst
place, this section is vague
and ambiguous. As a lawyer,
I am sure you can see the
~hnzard and pitfalls herein hi-
votved, No standards are set

Conformity

One oi the chief criticisms
oi present-day college students
is that they are coniorinist, inn
ciincd toward security rather
than adventure. A major probe
lcni oi higher education is to
achieve tree and open discus
sion oi controversial issues.
Youth should be a time or
searching and questioning. it
young people do not consider
new ideas nor think outside
\vclldvorn grooves, they can
never learn to think illdepciitL
ently or to grow intellectually.

Educational Autonomy

To preserve our basic polit-
ieal - edoms in this country.
it is iinpoi ant that there be

many mm ENDENT colleges
‘ tliatare not controlled by gov-
ernment. One of the principal
reasons ior the existence or .
private colleges, one ol the
reasons that donors can lie,
asked to support them, is that 1

of our educational system is
an indispensable elcmcnt oil

leontrol oi thought and to the
use oi education as on
