Graves' Works Show Qualiiy 1

Common To Chinese Painiers ‘i

by Laurel Ellison

Morris Graves' paintings, new
on display in Main lobby, are {me

called “Ute operation oi the
Spirit in producing thc mine

Graves is concerned with dis

The way Giaves goes about

inized in the delicate structure

His subjects face (us avoid) the
problems of -the situations in
which they are placed in intense»
conscious
ly indiridual. pe sonal ways
They are, in iacl, so personal
that they relate to ‘ilmosv. sub—
ities oi ,oankrnds in general. and
thus acquire universal inplica-
tions.

Therefore, one cannot strictly
say tlirt Graves is a painter oi
birds, or plants, etc. These are
simplr the media through
which he evokes a mysticism
common to all living things.
All of Graves’ birds have dis

The way he handles line is
‘pcrhaps one of the most impre.

Nixon Twists U-2,

(poli r-al editor)
vice—President Richard Nixon
reportedly gained support in the
TV debate last Friday, Oct. 7. He
did not deserve to gain it.

The Republican candidate won
votes by say'ng his party stood
strongly against the Communists
during the U72 incident and on
\he Formosa issue.

Nixon attacked Kennedy's
statement alter the 11-2 inci-
dent that the United States
should have apologized to rtus-
sia ii that would have 1)]‘6‘

Nixon’s answer was that tlii c
was nothing that could have be n
done to preserve the Sun t
conference, since Khrushchev did
not want one. "HQ knew these

flights were going on long be,

fore, and that was not the rea-
son that he broke up the confer
ence.” the Vicesprosident ar—
gned. ‘

The tact that Khrushchev
knew the United States was coll—
ducting espionage is not Tales
rant. The point is that when the
