Cowles hall has surprised eve

eryone and moved into a com-
manding lead in the 1M basket-

ball race. Two convincing vic-
, tories over Langa'n brought its
season record to 6 wins and no
losses. Ryd Wallerstedt, the hall's
leading scorer, again led the way
in the “A" team contest with TB
, points, while freshman Dorsie
lvy poured in 19 counters in
.the “B” game. Smith and. Raw-
son split in last .Saturday’s
games, thereby giving Smith its
second loss of the season and
Rawson its third. '

Smith, however, remained in
second place with a season's
recordoiewinsanlems,
one game ahead oi North's
third-place total oi 4.2, Dead-
locked in the lourth slot are

win and, ttuec‘ losses,
season is only hall over, and

with Cowles having all oi the
contending teams still on its
schedule, the iinal outcome is
still anyone”s guess; that is,
anyone except yours truly
