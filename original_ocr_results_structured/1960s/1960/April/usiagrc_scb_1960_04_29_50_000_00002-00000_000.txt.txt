The CofHP's Evidence

The CofHP this week convicted a student of a viola-
tion and fined him $25 using as evidence nothing more
ti an opinion and circumstance.

Accordillo' to our sources, there was enough doubt to
c'use at least two members oi" the CofHP to abstain or
1iite against the conviction. One house piesident said he=
aistained because tlle evidence was circumstantial, and
ir. such case, he believed that tlle defendant should be
given the benefit of the doubt.

But others seem to have been of the opinion that the,

“good judgment” of the president assessing the fine had
1:: be accepted. On what was that ”good judgment" based?

Last Saturday, as over 100>men roamed around north
campus during the water fight, somebody threw a fire-
cracker from the general direction of the darkened log’gia
l'iiof. Seconds later the individual fined was seen on the
llgg‘ia l'ooi'. Disl'eg‘arding' the fact tllatvtlle firecracker
could have come from a window 01 from somebody on the
ltggia who quickly 1e entered one of the claims the fine

ras le1ied

This is not a very impressive way to begin a llew year
of student government. We would hope that the appellate
court, il’ this case is appealed, will show some respect
for justice and factual evidence:
dently, unimportant to the majority of the CofHP.

Hall Spirit-it's Secondary

We look with favor upon the Concern shown for the
il’dividual student in the new recommendations of the ori—
entation committee. But we believe this idea should be
on ‘ied further.

We believe that the development‘ of the individual
spirit land expression should be stl'e d over hall or col-
lege spirit, loyalty alld “togetherness.”

We believe that the individual freshmen should have
as great a choice as possible concerning orientation. This
is not to say that they should not be encouraged to take
advantage of any opportunities which might be offered
by an orientation program, but that they should h; the
f.nal choice as to whether or not they wish to participate
il‘ these activities.

Hall and school unity are good if they are secondary
to individual expression and priva . Group lllli can grow
't of individual freedom, but we do not believe indil‘ldr
(\lity can grow from conformity.

Share-ArMeal

Grillnell is fol tunate in that foul tel 11 students will
attend school hele next yeal. One of these four will be a
student from Kenya.

Here, perhaps more than ill the cases of other fore-
ign student plans, the student body has had a direct part
in making the venture linancia v po ihle. This has been
(one through the “sllal'e~21-llietll" program.

Tomol row night we \1ill not eat steak. We will eat
blend and soup and cheese. Those people who know what
the score is will realize what a small sacrifice it really is.
con derillg‘ the l’act that we all have the means to “_ lli'i'"
ourselves whenever we wish regardless of the “share-11-
l‘oeal” supper.

We hope that all of the students will realize this and
