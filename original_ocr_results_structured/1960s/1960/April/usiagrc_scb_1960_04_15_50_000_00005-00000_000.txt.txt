Lasansky’s graphic art pre-
sents us with a combination or
technical mastery and expres-
sive ability that is found too
rarely in a world which, in
impatience, oitcn‘sacrihccs one
to the other. His retrospective
exhibition, fresh irom the Art
institute of Chicago and now
hanging in Main Hall and Bur-
ling library, is nothing to sniff
at; it is one or the ﬁnest events
or any kind that has appeared
at Grinnell this year.

The power oi Lnsansky's
prints does not stoop to ciain.

Lasansky's imagery runs from
the comiortingly, joyiully hue
man in the portraits of himselt
and his ianiily, to the rhythmic,
dynamic abstract in the gyrating
lal'cs of “Dachau” and “Time In
,Space.“ Usually it settles imbe-
:tween, in a mode or expression
through distortion. '
