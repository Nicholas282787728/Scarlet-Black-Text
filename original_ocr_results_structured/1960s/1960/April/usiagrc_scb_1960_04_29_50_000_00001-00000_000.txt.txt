No. 214

A greater emphasis on
the academic aspects of the
College is stressed in it new
recommendation from the
orientation committee. A
reading program for all in-
terested persons and fewer,
better orientation lectures
were also suggested by the
six students who drew up
the recommendations.

The independent studentrad—
,ministration group outlined its
proposals Wednesday night at
Student council meeting.

Although there were two sepa
arale reports, one for north
campus and one for south cam-
pus, they both stressed the need
Ior an academic side to fresh
man orientation.

The outline proposed for north
campus, presented by Jack
Swenson, read, “The purpose of
the proposed program is to pre-
pare thc new students to be re-
sponsible adult college students
by dealing with them as indivi s
not adults." ,

Both Swanson and commit-
tee chairman Chris Marcy,
who presented the proposed
program for the women, agreed
that an early introduction to
the academic or cultural side
l of the college, through ,a con-
cert or coffee hour, would be
beneﬁcial.

This, they said, was because
many freshmen were disappoint:
ed that they were introduced to
the social aspect during the
early days of the year. It would
also help them settle down and
realize that there is another
side to college life—“the three-
fourths” side, as Miss Marcy
,put it.

, while it was the opinion of
the committee that certain tra-
,ditions such as prep hats, phone
duty, smokers and the learning
of.hall songs and student names
he continued, there was no pro-
vision in the report [or a hazing
program.
it Both Swenson and Miss Marcy
recommended a reading course
for those who would "need or
tdesire to take it.” Swenson’s re-
“We suggest a five-

 

port said.
or sixaveek reading program...

It should be suggested to the

freshmen to read Norman Lew-

is’s ‘How to Read Better and

Faster' during the summer be-

fore they arrive at Grinnell. If

it is impossible to offer a speed

reading course, this book should

be available on campus."

In the south campus report
it was suggested that orienta-
tion lectures he organized
over a shorter period of time.
There was some indication that
y the lectures are considered a
waste or time by many rresh—
men because “speakels some.
times say a lot for Io minutes,
then just ramble on for the
rest of the time." ‘

“One serious lack at Grinncll
college," stated the south cam
pus report, “is the small number
of people who can adequately do
counseling wor l' It was sug~
gested that there be “experts
in the various fields open for
study who could answer ques-
‘tions adequately and who could
‘lell the freshmen what courses
should be taken..l=reshinen are
not full or questions on their
futur-e- r so the people should
be engaged who could really
help them out.”

Both i-cpoits recommended
that as much of the orientation
program as possible be carried-
1out on an individual hall basis
rather than on a campus level.
