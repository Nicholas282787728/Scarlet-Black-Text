More Than An Opportunity

In an editorial which appeared in this paper last year
in conjunction with the Afro—Asian conference, the obser—

vation was made that

“in our day-toeday classroom-

dorm-Union‘ existence, our perception and understanding of
the contemporary conflicts arising between the nations of
the world cannot help but become confused and meaning-

less to a great extent."

Although there does seem to

of American students, away

he a trend, on the part
from this confusion and in-

difference, there iS, to some extent, still the problem of .iso-

lation from World affairs.

Grinnell, as many other colleges, has a program of
lecture series each year to help the students break away

from this isolation and share knowledge and experiencei

with those who have a part in shaping the policies of

the nation and the world.

This year Chester Bowles, Democratic congressman
from Connecticut, will speak on “Agenda For 1961" in the
26th Rosenfield Lecture series. In his lectures he will deal
with various problems which will face the new President

in 1961.

But it is no revelation to say that the agenda for
1961 or any year affects not only one man or one adminis
tration but the entire population of the world.

Mr. Bowles is here primarily as a teacher. His pres—
ence is more than an opportunity for students. It repre-
sents a responsibility—a responsibility which must be met.

30 wles And Disarmament Policy

by Dixie Harrington

Chester Bowles is among those
statesmen who, in addition to
their special foreign policy in-
terests in foreign aid on policy
toward Communist China, etc,
ﬁnd a common concern in the
problems of disarmament.

In an article entitled “Why
the Kremlin Will Not Disarm,”
Congressman Bowles holds out
hope that the Kremlin cven-
tually might disarm and sug-
gests what the United States
should do to prepare ior the
worst or the best.

There are two
States. why the Soviet Union
should want a sweeping dis-
armament program.

The ﬁrst is that it could then
divert some of the 22 percent
of its production now spent on
the military to the production
of consumer goods to raise the
standards of living in Russia and
to launch a trade and aid of-
fensive in the underdeveloped
countries. Khrushchev believes
that Communism would win in
peaceful competition.

According to Mr. Bowles,
Khrushchev also believes—or
at least, should believe, if he
is a good Marxist—that a re-
duction in American anna-
ments spending would so dis-
rupt this country with unem-
ployment and depression that
the downfall oi capitalism
would be hastened.

There are explanations, on the
other hand, for Communist un-
willingness to negotiate a work
able disarmament. Congressman
Bowles suggests that these in
clude:

(1) fear of “a resurgent, arm»
col Germany, NATO, and the
worldwide American n u c l c a r
base system";

(2) uncertainty

reasons, he

about the

 

growing power oi China and
the extent of Soviet control over
it;

(3) the Russian tradition of
sccrecy which is at the same
time an advantage over the
United States and a mesh in
which the Russian leaders theme
selvcs are caught;

(4) policy dinercnccs within
the Communist party and has
tween it and the armcd forces,

(5) fear that “in a more re-

laxed and disarming world its
empire would disintegrate.”
“’ It is uncertain which forces
within the Soviet Union will
prevail, those of tear or those
oi conﬁdence in thc results of
disarmament. But in its corre-
sponding uncertainty, the Unit.
ed states must not he unpre—
pared.

Congressmen Bowles recom-
mends a threefold policy oi
preparation. For the worst, we
need expanded ground forces
and greater missile development
and production. This is, he con~
tends, necessary for two reasons.
First, “we are helpless to do
otherwise." Second, and more
important, there is “an outside
chance that our decision to
match,the Kremlm missilc for
missilc might help to persuade
the Russian leaders that the
race has become too expensive
and too dangerous, and that a
major relaxation of the arms
competition would be in their
interest."

The second part oi Bowles’
policy requires that we dem-
onstrato convincingly to the
world that we want to nego-
tiate large-scale disarmament.
The divisions between the
AEC, the Pentagon, and the
State department should be
resolved, with the State de~
partmcnt prevailing.

SCARLET AND BLACK

by Staff Reporter

Quite in keeping with recent
issues and developments here
on campus comes the Rosenﬁeld
lecture series, which has as its
object the presentation of a
broader view of national and
particularly international affairs
to the Grinnell student.

Going into its 26th year, the
series, begun with a grant
irom Mrs. Meyer Rosenﬁeld oi
Des Moines in 1934, promises
to be a catalyst to the steps
already taken here toward in-
creasing student interest in a
world bigger than just two
campuses and Grinncll,
Interest in national and in-

ternational aiiaii-s is not a new

thing to Grinncll, as a closer

View of the Rosenﬁeld scrics

history reveals.

Early lecturers included such
notables as W. Arnold Forster,
British author on world chairs,
once associated with the League
oi Nations; Proixs Hans Kahn
and Walter Kotching of Smith
college; Frof. Owen Lattlmore,
leading expert on the Far East
and political adviser on Chiang
Kai-Shelr; Dr. Hans Simon of
thc New School for Social Re
search; and Dr. Pelman B. For
,tcr, associated with the institute
Iior International Study at Ger
neva.

In 1949 Grinnell served as
host to a four-day convention
of the citizens' committee for
United Nations reform. This
earlier tradition was carried
into still more recent years.
~0llfstanding Speakers contin-
Iled to come to Gil’illncll.

Clyod Head, NBC commen-
tator and a world traveler,
as well as Donald Williams,
director oi visual aid for the
Point rour program in the
Middle East, appeared in the
lecture series presentation for

low in 1951,

On Friday, between engage-
ments at Grinnell, Bowles will
go to Des Moines to address
the Chamber of Commerce at a
luncheon.

Bowles will be the 26th
speaker in tho Rosenfleld series
since it was initiated in 1934
by a grant from Mrs. Meyer
Rosenﬁcld of Des Moines.

possibility of disarmament, we
must have a plan for the transir
tion from armaments production
to peace-time programs of ex-
panded u r b a n development,
housing and hospital, school and
road construction.

Chester Bowlcs concludes with
a warning oi the urgency of
formulating and following
through on disarmament .pro.
posals: “the world has an im»
mediate need” ior an agreement
to “curtail the spread of nuclear
weapons and information to ad-
ditional governments.

“Competent American ex—
perts estimate that there are
at least is nations whose eco-
nomic Capacity will enable
them to manuiocture nuclear
weapons during the next dec-
ade. The ‘nth country problem'
leads us into new, enormous
dangers." .
To this, it is only necessary
to add that the French have
recently tcstcd atomic bombs in
the Sahara and that reports
from india predict Communist
Chinese nuclear tests in the
next few months.

Rosenfield Series: 26th Year

 

1952. The speakers saw the
paralysis of the Middle East
not as a result of any lack
of intelligence or culture.

Ralph Bunche, director of the
UN. trustecship council, was
the 1954 Roseniield lecturer and
spoke on “The Future of the
United Nations." lie was fol-
lowed the next year by Arthur
Schlcssingcr Jr., professor oi
history at Harvard, who dis-
cussed “The Crisis oi Freedom
in America."

Dr. Theodore W. Schultz, Uni-
versity of Chicago economist,
lectured in 1956. Schultz’s sub-
ject was “Putting Our 'Economr
ic System Against That oi the
U.S.S.R."

The 1958 lecturer was Dr.
Henry A. Kissinger, director
oi the Rockefeller foundation’s
special studies project, who
spoke on "The Nuclear Age
and Foreign Policy." Kissinger,
author oi “Nuclear Weapons
and Foreign Policy,” advocat—
ed reexamination oi the na—
ture of military power and
preparation for limited war-
fare as the only answers to
slow butsure enemy advances.

Saunders Redding, professor
of creative writing at Hampton
institute, Virginia, was the RDA
senﬁeld lecturer in 1959. He
Ispoke on “The Meaning of Ban-
dung." Reddmg's speech opened
the Afro~Aslan conference held
at Grinnell March 6 and 7 last
year.

ln his talk Redding explained
that ﬁnancial aid alone would
not win the peoples oi Africa
and Asia as friends for the
US. “We want to be co-workers
in the kingdom of culture. We
want economic aid, surely, and
a fair share of the world’s re-
sources; but most of all, and
ﬁrst of all, we want the ac-
knowledgement of human equal-
ity."

people properly, to give good
education to its children or to
provide for its aged, the fed

Bowles believed that an im-
portant way to prevent this

the effectiveness of state gov-

ii Connecticut and other states
could set high enough stand.
ards oi ndministrativn, respon-
sibility and enicicncy, there
would be less need to turn to
Washington.

Bowlcs sought to teach the
the people that political liberty
had far broader implications
than simply the right to vote
and to choose representatives.

political liberty are three basic
concepts.

First, people as a whole
have the judgment and ability
to conduct their government
more honestly, more iairly and
more effectively than my sin-
gle elite group. Secondly, the
people have the light and
power to construct a govern—
ment oi their own choosing
and ﬁtted to their own needs.
Thirdly, that government is
responsible directly to the peo-
ple, deriving its power through
the consent of the majority.
Bowles discovered that nearly
one»half of the voting popula-
tion who voted in the 1949 elec-
tions were screened “Independr
ents." Bowles strongly believes
that the independents are sloWA
mg down the development of a
dynamic, responsible twosparty
system in the United States. Unr
loss the two major parties suc-
ceed in wooing and winning the
Independents as regular party
members, they will continue to
bc handicapped in their eﬁorts
to offer consistently top level
candidates or aggressive, clearly
defined programs, or to produce
responsible and effective politi-
cal action,

increasing at an average rate
of approximately 3.5 percent per
year, the population has also
been increasing at an average of
approximately 15 percent per
year, and therefore more than
half of the advance in output
has been reduced more than half
by increased population which
eats away at the advance. As
well as an increase in the out-
put of these underdeveloped ma»
tions, there must be some cur-
tallmenl oi the population if a
sustained and poweriul econom-
ic thrust is to be made. Nearly
all the underdeveloped nations
surfer greatly from the ravages
of overpopulation.

Another ioirly universal
plight oi these nations is the
lack oi any strong education—
a] system to provide eventual
leaders ior economic progress.
Foreign technical expens to
aid an advance offer only lim»
ited help as they are not ins
digenous to the conditions of
the countries, and technicians
are required as a permanent
port of the economic scheme
to be able to continue the
economic thrust. The countries
have a small force or the elite
who maintain themselves by
remaining a fairly autonomous
group and have neither the
sufficient numbers nor interest
to provide the technical ex-
perts necessary.

Besides the lack of the peo-
ple to provide the drive, there
‘is a gross lack of the capital
equipment such as communica-
tions, port facilities, highways,
,bridgcs, dams and the like, upon
which‘ a dynamic economy de-
pends. It is diﬁicult to gain the
Icopital to invest in these proj-
ects because they do not yield
ldirect or immediate proﬁts, but
their presence is essential for
any economic growth.

The position of the economic—
ally advanced nations of the
world is one oi great responsi—
bility to the underdeveloped
[states There is a great division
;between the “haves” and the
,“havemots,” and if the “haves"
hope to maintain their position
of economic stability, they must
ircalize that a balanced world
economy is imperative. The hope
ior maintenance of not only ma-
terial integrity but also ideolog-
ical strength depends on the de-
veloped nations to assist the un—
,derdcveloped nations on their
separate paths of economic
,growth.

The economic and ideolog—
ical tics can be seen in two
widely separate areas in the
cases oi India, which is at-
tempting economic develop-
ment along democratic lines,
and China, which is working
her economic progress on Mao-
modiﬁcd Marxian lines. There-
fore, it appears that the cold
war struggle between the no.
tions oi the free world and
the communist bloc is as much
economic as it is nuclear.

The underdeveloped and un-
committed pcoples oi the world
loolr to india and China as the
two examples of different kinds
of economic progress and will
tend to accept the ideology be-
bind the most successful« eco-
nomic thrust of the two Asiatic
states. These nations will nature
ally seek and eventually follow
the seemingly most successful
pattern to turn their circles oi
poverty into circles of progress.

Bowlcs had partly succeeded,
through action based on his po—
litical philosophy, in fulﬁlling
thsneeds of Connecticut. He
instituted a housing program, a
school construction bill, the ex~
pension of mental hospitals, an
emergency teacher-training pro-
gram, an increase in the limits
on old—age assistance and a civil
rights bill which included the
prohibition of discrimination in
housing projects and other
places of public accommodation.
