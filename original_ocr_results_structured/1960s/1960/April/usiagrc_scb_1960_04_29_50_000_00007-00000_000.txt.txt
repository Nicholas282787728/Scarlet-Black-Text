Coach Irv Simone terms the
Carls, defending champions
this year, as “head and shoul-
ders over any other team
around."

Nor will the task be any
easier tomorrow, for St. Olaf
ranks as the second best Squad
in the league, although thcre is
a smaller gap between it and
the Pioneers. Despite the in.
creasing difficulty of earnlng‘
points in a quadrangular meet,
‘the Gl'innellians should give
their opponents a hard time.
