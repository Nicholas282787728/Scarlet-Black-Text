Why do they have passhotik _
,‘iceallse they are sick, Be ausc thm' are lg'_lorallt lll‘i’l
1'8.t‘l ill their ignorance Because they are alt'ald.

You are not afraid. But you are no better thall thew:
lielilld the lunch counter or behind the machine gun.
Because you are lazy and indifferent. You say “Giillllell
has no lace problellliaren't \l'e \l'olldel't‘lll'l" But you re.
fuse to leolt beyond this isolated little utopia.

You scream and rate against a disclaimer affidavit
because it is all illl' nixemelit on democracy, but you turn
your back to a plea for guaranteed equality and iust‘ice.
lt's "democracy for me? Olget the others.” It would
seem that you are rather tuorfaced. Yes, that’s it exactly.

And the pathetic truth is, that ill spite of a fund or
a church movement or a paper declaration by a council,
ill spite of these isolated spat-ks of concern or pseudofcons
cei-n, the aliatll , the indifference; the overall twortaced
tillalityl which is the real danger to everything is still
there. Or do you even care.
