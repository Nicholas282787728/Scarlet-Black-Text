Nomination day was set ior
Jan. 4; general elections ior,
Maren 19, and the day to sumel
nion a new parliament was set
for March so. Meanwhile, Car
lombo was preparing to electi
a municipal council to replace:
one which had been dissolved by
the M.E.F, government in 1957‘
On Dec. 19 the UN? had at
decisive victory in that election:
the M.E.P, and Communist par
ty (C.F.) were severely dcieatcd
and even the head oi the C.P.,
a very respected person, lost his
seat which he had held for 12

But it is not possible to pres
diet how the country as a
whole will vote on March 19
on the basis or what happens
in Colombo. Actually, the
country is somewhat split. Co-
lombo is the most educated
area, and tho U.N.P is very
popular with the middle-class
worker; but the port laborers
and others in many oi the
leftist unions and those who
live in the slum areas are
anti-U.N.l>.

But meanwhile, Dahanayake

The L.S.SP has always sat
in the opposition. This party is
said to be based on the Trotsky

by a wellreducated and respect:
