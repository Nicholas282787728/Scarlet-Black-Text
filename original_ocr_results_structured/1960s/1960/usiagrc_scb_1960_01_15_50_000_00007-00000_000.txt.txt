“joking" comment about the
unimportance oi sports at a'
iiberal arts college such as;
Grinnell, and it will he re-‘
warding when he overhcars a i
lively discussion on the topic 1
oi sports, a discussion which l
has as its basis the comments .
and reports appearing on these

It has been my irequcntlv
:Latcd position that sports den]

neither ovcr nor underumphasm

Only through the
eilorts of the past and present
coaching, stall-

the continuing efforts of these}
groups will they keep this plaeel

And to Dale I should like to .
say that in. college newspaper ;
