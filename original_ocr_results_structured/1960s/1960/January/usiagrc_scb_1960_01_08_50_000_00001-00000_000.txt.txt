Hazing, as part: of the
freshman orientation pro-
gram, has been abolished.

Bowen last Wednesday

In a'ietter to Dick Ramsdcll,
C of HP president, Bowen said,

mal, is to be eliminated from
the student life of Grinnell."

, Included in Bowen’s deﬁni-
tion of hazing are 1. any
physical contact between up—
perclassmen and freshmen.
“except in the handshake and-
sport"; 2. forcing freshmen
to run errands or performing
other services for upperclass-

ities calculated to humiliate,

College Ends '
Money Drive;

Reaches Goal

The college administration
yesterday announced successful
completion of a two-year capital
development campaign in which
gifts and pledges totaled more
than $2,600,000. The campaign
ended officially on Dec. 31.

The college’s new $1,200,»
ooo Burling- lilirary, dedicated
in October, and a $1,300,000
fine arts center, now under
construction, were the 'princi-
pal objectives of the fund—
raising_ effort. Almost 2,300
gifts and pledges,rthe largest
of which was $700,000, were ‘

Bowen based his action on
his belief that “it would be
impracticable and perhaps un-
fair to place upon the new
Council of House Presidents the
entire burden of deciding the
role of hazing . . . “If the new
Council were faced with a de-
cision on hazing, it would find
its time and energy diverted
unnecessarily from the construc-
tive task of working out a new
orientation program,"

In relation to the new pro-
gram-[or both men and wom-
en. Bowen said he plans to
establish a student-administra:
tive advisory committee on‘

‘ freshman nricntaticn. The, stu-‘

- dent members will be nomi-
hated by the Student Council,
the C of HP, and the AWS'
Board; ‘

The whole; new programl
Bowen said, should be design-t

ed by consideration of the ques- .

tion, “What experiences during
the early months of students’
careers at Grinnell will be most
likely to advance their educa-
tion and to encourage them to‘
contribute to the student life
of the college?"

The intent of the committee, .
Norton said, is to help reduce

feel to earn an arbitrary grade-

many of them to neglect more
important educational values.

Social Experiment
With Coed Dining .
To Begin Thursday

Thursday night will ,be
the ,first night for coed din-
ng, according to a recent
announcement by President
"task
fol'ce’! named to work out
details of the experiment.
Further details concerning
the division of students have
not yet been disclosed.

The “task force", headed by
Student Council President Steve
raunce and Dean of Women
Evelyn GardnerV also set the
following dates for coed dining:
next Saturday, Jan, 16 (fresh
man class dinner at the Quad),

, Tuesday, Jan. 19 and Saturday,

The coed dining program was
suggested by President Bowen.

’ ' who declared that "possible ob-

jectives" would be 'to enable
students to enlarge their ac-
quaintanceships, to enable the
classes to achieve greater unity,
to make dining more gracious
and to make student life more
interesting by varying our rou—
tine.” '

l The president added at that
time, “We should give this in»
novation a good try." How-
ever, he said, “If it becomes
clear that the great majority
of our students do not like
coeducational dining, we should
be ready to drop the experi—
ment.”
