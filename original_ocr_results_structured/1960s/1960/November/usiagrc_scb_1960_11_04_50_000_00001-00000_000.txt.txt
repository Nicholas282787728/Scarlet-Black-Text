The fact that the 1960 Regen»
iield lecturer has the word
France in his name is not due
to his being a Frenchman

Mendcs France explained ii. this '

way. .

During the inquisition many
people took the name of their
father. since there were many
named Mendcs, his portuguese
ancestors added a
five centuries ago, and the result
was Mcndcs France.

“it is a very sunny and mys-
terious thing," Mendes France
said. “I have studied this," he
added, “and the only thing we
know is that there is no hy—
phen in it. Americans have still
managed' to hyphenate it."

As the former French primc
minister spent his tirst hour on
Iowa soil, he demonstrated a re:
niarkable blend of the high exe-
cutive and the common man. im.
mediately after his warm greet.
ing, he sought to make arrange
ments to receive a transcript oi
the major policy speech Premier
Charles Decaulle was to giw
today. Mendes France is the
leader of the opposition to Pre-
mier Decaulle.

He quickly read the mail that
had been sent to him at Grinnell.
