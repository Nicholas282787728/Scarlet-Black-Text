(speech) after the congresm’nnll's speech Monday night

Representative Fred Schwengel
(R Iowa) said last Monday night
that th U..S must advance in
four wide ai‘oas: human rights
‘and needs, science and technol-
ogy, economic opportunity and
progress, and national security
and peace,- in order to meet the
. hallanges oi a “new era oi
progress.” '

Speaking in the private din-
ing room to the Young Repub-
licans and" their guests,
Schwengel said, “Good things
okays to be'made to happen"
and “our party has seen the
need oi doing something ybsia
i live” in these tour areas.

“I am surprised that civil
rights are an issue in 1960 'l he
said. He indicated that the prob- l
lems of civil rights must be
olved not: only ior domestic
reasons but also to "strengthenl
ur foreign from.”

Schwengel stressed the need
,or'public knowledge and under~
standing of science and technol-
gy as well as minimum federal
control in these ﬁelds. He said
hat progress in these ﬁelds is
necessary not only tor the na»
tion’s defense but also in order
that the American standard of
living may be raised.

Economic opportunity and
progress, Schwengei said,
should be based on “the faith
and consciousness ior Amen-
cans as individuals" Although
Schwengel is known to have
spoken out against inﬂation,
he did not go into detail on
the economic problem in this
speech.

“Although
gress (in

I went to Con-
1954) as an isola-
.tionist, I had a very rude
aw kening.” said Schwengcl.
.i-ie indicated that in order to
gain national security and
peace our ioreign policy should
be based on a feeling oi broth.

‘various nations He said in ref-
crcnce to the late John Foster
Dulles that “he was right in
his time and headed us in the

ht direction asllto- a ioreign
policy

‘ While the congressman did
not elaborate on any or the

 

points during the speech, he dis-
cussed them in more detail in

r

Langan hall lounge after the
speech.

He said that the problemgoi
civil ‘tlghls in the 509th
should be handled by district
judges, and ii they would not
handle them fairly, new
judges should be brought into

the dbtﬂct.

“I would go all the way in
the South but this is not pos.
sible all at once,” he said. In
this problem oi civil rights,
is necessary to deal with the-
hcarts and minds or people."
He advocated‘ more education

‘as one solution and the.accept>

sponsibility as another.
-Schwengei said that 'the
Democratic party is split on
such issues as civil rights and
labor while the Republican
party is “closer on all these

as assistant
New Mexico universityc
buouerqne, N. M.

Speaking of his choice to
move‘ to the bigger school.
Peterson said. “It. was a diffiv
cult decision to make. I have
many roots in Grinnell, both in
the town and the college. Dur-
ing my tenure at this school
[’ve made many iriends and

Peterson

have always valued the assodiar
lions I've had '\Viih the ath-
letes here."

He Went on to say that. he
would continue to remain loyal
to Grinnell and its sports teams
and that his biggest regret was
in leaving the, iootball and
wrestling teams oi next year.
Both squads, he feels, have the
ionndation on which to build
successful seasons.

.Peterson, who” at one time or
another .has coached nearly
every sport at this school, Will'
leave for Albuquerque, around
March i, so as to arrive in time
ior spring iootball practice at
the Southwest conierence school.

Serving as head iootball coach
since 1955, Peterson has steered
his gridiron teams to moderate
successes, His 1953 squad’s 21-5‘
upset of an unbeaten Coe team
in the tinal game oi the season'
is a game that stands out in the
,minds or most tans.

As a wrestling coach "Pete"
had a iirst division team almost
