ll. 5. Good Taste ~ Common §eilse

Last summer the Young Democratic club of Northern
Illinois university scheduled all address to be made by
James" \V t, executive secretary of the Communist party
03" Illinois. /

 

Leslie A. Holmes, president of the univc sity. banned
West's appearance alid was criticized for his actions by
tile Illinois division of tile American Civil Liberties unioll.

The Macomb (ill.) Journal has this to say. “Why . .

should he be criticized for barring a Communist? Why
should the tavpayers provide ally Communist with a stage?

”The issue is not academic freedom. Ii iolyed are good
taste, common sense, loyalty to country and the need to
let Communists know they are held in hatred and contempt'
and regarded as unfit to be received by decent people."

This is one more example of the nationalistic self-
righteousness which plagues the United States today. This
is an attitude shared not only by private citizens but also
by many representatives ill government.

John Lynch. state senator from New Jersey, said re-
ntly that his state is “too nice a place to be spoiled by
even the thought of Khrushchev's presence.” Again this
has a reaction to a student invitation to the communist
leader.
, The folly is evident. when a supposedly democratic
society denies its students the right to learn, then those
students cannot be blamed in doubting the since u of
that society alld doing everything possible to correct the
situation.

In this election year. it would be wise to watch for

and vote against such persons who claim “loyalty” to theii'tcause they find it difficult to change over suddenly ,troml

country and yet would deny opportunities to learn and act
ill what we woilld call a democratic and logical way.

ROTC Al Grinnell

As we stated in an editorial last weeli, we are not ill
favor of any movement to push a voluntary R.O.T.C. pro—
gram out of Gi'innell.

It is doubtful as to whether or not a small glollp of
students could do anything. which would not antagonize
most of the campus, to get rid of the illlit. There would
be a great waste of time and et't'ort. Tlle pr sence of one
ILO.T.C. unit at Grinnell should not hinder any sincere
and mature el'iorts to further the cause of peace and dis
armament.

This is especially the case since the Grinllell program
is a Voluntary program ill which no student is required to
participate. For many of those who do,participate, R.O.T.C.
and the pos raduate program which l'ollows are means
by which mil dry obligation can be met.

Since it is a part of the International Relations club,
we would suppose that this disarmament group is concern—
ed with a serious study of the disarmament program.

Aboltivc attempts to drive away the ”other side" cannot.

We would suggest that the officers of the Grilluell
It.0.'|‘.C. be invited to participate ill the lscl siolls This
course of action will be much more profitable than any
attempts to get rid of the unit.

_It is evident that the CofHP means business on this

In the meantime it would probably be best to support

Progress Demands Lea

idersllip

At this poillt the progress made ill the student move-
nlellt for disarmament has been disappointing. Their ac-
tions are virtually unknown to most. of the campus. We
would hope that these students who have taken it upon

themselves to lead. will realize the seriousn
cy of the problem. "

Mature. calculated leadership is needed. Leaders and
org‘ani ‘l‘s must be carefully chosen. Whoever leads must
liliow where they are going and what steps will be taken
to get there. Although there have been several progi ssive
steps taken, there seems to be. at this time a pre aleilt
atmosphere of confusion and misguided eilel and emo-
tion.
