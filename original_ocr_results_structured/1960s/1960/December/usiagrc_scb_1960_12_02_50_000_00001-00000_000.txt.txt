iLong SC Debate
Ends In 24-7 Vote

Dec. 7 Set For Referendum

t
l
t
t

The Student Council voted 24‘
‘7 Wednesday in favor ot a mo—
‘ on that “a referendum be put
lbetore the student body calling
tlor a constitutional convention
tor the purpose of re—evaluating
and, if necessary, reorganizing
student government.“
A long and serious debate
‘ was undertaken in Council as
i the culmination of a series oi
rumors that have. been cir—
l culating around campus since
Cowles hall
the CoiHP.

“seceded” from

The debate was occasioned by "

‘ motion made by Bayard Cat-
- on, the temporary representa<
‘tive to SC irom Cowles, that
“a referendum be put bctore
the student body, calling for a
lcunstitutional convention for the
Ipul‘pose oi recvaluating and,
f necessary, reorganizing the
student government at Grim
nell." Debate on the motion was
limited to 45 minutes.

Council president D u a n e
Krohnke relinquished the chair
to Lois Christopherson during
the debate so that he might
speak in favor oi the motion a.
long with Jerry Shiplcy, Ernie
Butherlord and Mike Horwatt.
Speakers against the motion in-
cluded Karen Halvorscn, Gary
Knamiller and Dick Barbour.

Arguments for the referendum
icentcred around a list of grie-
vances that had been published
by Cowles hail and distributed
at the meeting. Among these
,grievances were the lack of
balanced student government,
the lack of communication be-
tween thc three branches of stu-
dcnt. government and the Ade
ministration, and the lack of a
fair judicial system.

Arguments against the re-
ferendum centered around the
contention'that although there
were grievances, many of them
justified, a constitutional cons
vention was not the best method
in which‘to settic them because
of the the terrific amount of
work involved.

Some speakers against the
motion argued that both the
CofHP and AWS Board are now
considering changes that can.
not wait for a constitutional
convention, Finally, a few
speakers were just not satisfied
that, the pressnt system was so
bad that it needed to be chang—
led by a convention.

After the debate, the motion
was brought Io nvoteJtpass-
ed by a total of 24 in favor
and seven opposing.

Because some students are
unaware oi the reasons tor a
‘convention, a motion was made
and passed by a close mnrgin,
lthat any group interested in hav.
ting the convention, draw up a
llist oi purposes and goals it
lwould want such a convention
lto accomplish, The groups will
lalso be responsible roi- distri.
lbuling thcsc lists to the sm—
idem body beiore the rcieren.
‘duui is voted upon

Another motion made -in re-
‘lation to this referendum was
that the l‘eIL‘l‘endum be placed
belol‘e the student body
Wednesday from 9 2.111. to 4

p.in., and that a majority or the
‘votos cast be considered bind»
ing. This motion was passed by
a large majc 'iy.
