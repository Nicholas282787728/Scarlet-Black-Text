Speaking at thc iii-st session
oi a state conierence of the Col.
lcgiatc Council for the United
Nations held at Grinnell last
Saturday, E, B, Smith oi iowa,
State university discussed "The
international Court of Justice,
Past and Prospects."

The second session was 51
panel discussion on “lnternm
tionat Law." Panel members
were Dr, Smith, iiaroid Flat»
clier (political science),
~Willlam s. Vanderpool
(speech), Dan Figgins and Ray .
‘llorton.

The conference’s last section
involved a presentation of a
model international Court oi
Justice trial solving a dispute
,between the United States and
the U.S,S,R. over a “violation

of the International Antarctic."|
l

The session was introduced by
Kay Rook, who gave the back
ground ‘of the Court oi Justice,
and Chris Greene, who presents
ed a general outline ot the
court. Barb Hurst served ’as
clerk pf-thc court; Bob Millar,
chiei iudge; and Steve Fleck
and Gary Hanson, attorneys for
the US. and-USSR.

best handled through legal
channels, others must still

channels.

Dr, Smith agreed by come
inenting that we would hurt the

_U.N, by asking it to solve pro— Committee

citing the Berlin issue as such
a problem.

Thc conclusion reached by the

lpanel was that the basic out-sat

tion, “international Order by
Law or Force." was a misstate-

:rnent. Order in the toreseeabie‘

fnture must be based on both
law and the real political power
and situation. The method of
court adjudication is helpful in
cases of a judicial, nonspol
cal nature, and should be excl‘
cised.

speech for the International
Court session complemented
Dr. Smith’s views that the rules
of the Permanent Court of Jus~
tice under the League of Na
