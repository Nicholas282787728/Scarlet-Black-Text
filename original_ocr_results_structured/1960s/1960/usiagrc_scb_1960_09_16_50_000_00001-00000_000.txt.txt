Bowen Talk Cites
Four Major Goals

(Text On Page Nine)

i. Speaking before the first col-
lege convocation of the year last
might in Herrick chapel. Presie
dent Howard B. Bowen called
for rejection of “threc goals
which have been first on the llSt
for Americans; high consump~
.tion, leisure and security."

Addressing faculty and
dents on the subject of “Your
Vocation,” or. Bowen said that
it has become .“abundantly clear
that these things are not ade-
quate goals and that the real
goals which Americans should

sllle

in a great program of national
and international brotherhood,
assistance and development."

Dr. Bowen railed the llie that
is “surrounded by chromium
Plated gadgets" the “American
foolishness.” He said that since
America has reached a sort of
economic maturity that the op-
yol‘tunitics made available by
this abundance must he put to
use. .

The president asked students.
la: they consider their; vocations.
to balance their “personal goals
of money. ease and security
against the more compelling
goals of freedom. peace and hue
mane culture for all men."

or. Bowen listed four malor
goais for Americans in the .com-
ing decades. .“The first of these
goals." he said, “is to encourage
and assist economic development
among the underprivileged peo—
_ples of the World. . . . ,To facnliv
ltate economic development
tabroad. our capital and our food
lare needed. but even more our
knowledge and our skills are
n‘eeded."

The second goal. said Dr.
Bowen. is to "foster and encoure
age freedom and human dignity
at home and abroad."

He said that the American
history “imposes upon us the
moral obligation to use our in-
{luellce and our resources in
support of the legitimate aspir-
ations of downtrodden and op-
pressed peoples everywhere."

He called tor cooperation ‘wilh
