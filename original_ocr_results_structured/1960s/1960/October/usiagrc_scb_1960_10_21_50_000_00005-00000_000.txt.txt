Looking At Sports

by Dale Furnish

Something which has been remarked on by Coach Edd
Bowers and others connected with the Grinnell football team
is the fine spirit shown by the student body in support of its
athletes. After an opening loss, a good crowd turned out for the
home opener and was rewarded with the spectacle of a re»
sounding win over Lawrence.

The next weekend, Homecoming against Coe, saw my
Grinncllians give up their Saturday afternoon naps and study
sessions to attend. Once again they saw their team gain a
thumping victory over an old rival.

Last Friday when the team left for the Carleton game, a
small crowd of cheerleaders and students were on hand to see
them off. It was in the middle of an hour when classes are
held and there was no mob, but it was encouraging to see.

The starting lineup then reads}

Dunn, halfbacks; Lowry,
back; Art Peterson, quarterback;
Jim Simmons and Bob Eikkers,
ends; Arlan Danne and Dennis
Asby, tackles; Dick Barbour and
Frank Scott, guards; and Terry
Moore, center.

 

 

Grinnell’s defensive unit also deserves a pat on the back
They have been ranked in the top in among the nation’s small
colleges the first three weeks of the season and, despite suffer-
ing the indignity of a 63-yard pass play for a touchdown last
week, still rank within the top 15 teams on their average of

129.9 total yards allowed peg game. ‘
