Bowles

Cont. from 11. 4

that the US. should not hold
3 Summit conference if it is
not more powerful than RIIS-
sla.

An increase in the desire and
the possibility of Bowles becom-
ing secretary of state rather
than Stevenson is indicated by
the following statements Bow-
les has made.

Grinnell, April 8: “I thinkl
that if any Democrat except
Adlai Stevenson were President,
Stevenson would he secretary
of state.”

“Meet. The Press" television'
program, August: ”Adlai Stev-
enson would make an excellent
secretary of state.

The translation of this poli-
tical language is “I used to
think Adlai had it in the bag,
but now I merely have to say
he could do the job if for some
reason I didn‘t get it."

When he was at Grinnell
Bowles made no secret of the
fact that he would like a high
administrative post in the State
department. This was also in-
dicated in the statement he
made Aug. 11 announcing that-
he would not seek re-election
to Congress.

He said that he was with-
drawing from the race so that
he could serve his “country
in precisely those areas of
government where I have had
the greatest experience . i .
My own primary and abiding
interest is the conduct of
American foreign policy.

"If the next President of the
United states should ask me to
serve in any one of several
posts ior which he might con-
sider me qualified, I would want
to feel free to accept."

Bowles‘ decision not to run‘
for Congress was made less dif-
ficult by the fact that he had
a good chance of being defeat-
ed. That is not the case with
Gov. Loveless.

Loveless is ahead of his op.
ponent in the race for 11.5, sen-
ator from lowa. He convinced
this columnist in an interview
this summer that his prime ob.
jective was to become a senas
tor. \

Furthermore, after having giv-
en the lowa delegation to Ken»
nedy at the convention and get-
ting little in return, it does not
appear that he would trust
Kennedy to give him a high
position in the Department of
Agriculture.

The major reason Loveless
will probably not be a high of.
ficial in the agricultural depart.
ment is that he is not that well
informed about agricultural
problems. Agriculture is a much
more complicated field than
most people realize.

Loveless did say in the in-

Cobum's Work
Shown In Halls

by Marty Ehrlich

Oil paintings, ink drawings
and watercolors by Michael Co<
burn, ’62, West Norris philoso-
phy major, will be on exhibit
in East and West Norris lounges
through Oct. 25.

The paintings, which range in
subject matter from a winter
landscape to illustrations of var-
ious movements of Mussorgsky-
Ravel’s “Pictures At An Ex-
hibition," are characterized
mainly by their boldness and
compositional simplicity.

One of the more prominent
paintings in the exhibition,

“Firebird,” an oil, is in the
artist’s words, “an attempt to
use the brightest and darkest
colors in a successful composi-
tionr'

The brilliant reds and yellows
of the bird‘s figure contrast
brutally with the dark blue, al—
most black, background. This
creates a tremendous stress be-
tween the two that forces the
vibrant quality of the bird and
gives the painting a sense of
urgency. The composition is suit.
ably severe ‘ simple
summed up in the small sun.

“Valley of Snow," another
oil, is quite different, it is quiet
and relaxed. The eye is direct»
ed from the gentle hills to the
small village, to the winter
sky and back to the road—like
lines of force. The subdued
colors suggest the withdrawn
calmness of a late—afternoon,
winter landscape.

oils is ”Ballet of chicks in
their Shells," a brush and ink
drawing on a theme from a
movement of “Pictures at an
Exhibition." It is a quick sketch
exploiting the use of line.

The result is a well executed

terview: “i know the secretary
of agriculture will come from
the Midwest if Kennedy is elec-
ted.” The Kennedy forces may
officially make this promise be.
fore election day in order to
gain farm—belt support.
