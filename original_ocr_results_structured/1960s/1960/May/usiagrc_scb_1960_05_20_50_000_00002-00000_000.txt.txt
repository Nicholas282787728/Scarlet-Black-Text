The Necessary Gamble

According to the newspapers. senators from both par-
ties have "prodded tlle Defens department for a review
of the nation’s military situationiand possibly a bigger
armament effort ill the light ofrthe angry turn of U.S.7T‘vusA
sian relations.”

Patrick Huber, Mar

 

This reaction is to have been expected. But the state»
ment given by Pentagon officials testifying before the
Senate Appropr itions committee is something else again.

According to them, the budget already set ilp is ade-
~quate because it “was drafted on the assumption the Soviet
threat would be llndiminished no matter how the summit
tllrned out.”

Is this the desire of the United States for peace? If
the statement is true, it' could be assumed that the United
States has no more hope for or little more interest in a
workable peace thail 'do the Communists.

But is it really the United States as a whole? Many
people make the mistake of thinking all of the power is
ill the hands of the president or the premiere. The Llllir
mate power is, of collrse, here. But it is not the ultimate
power which will start the next war.

As olle stlidy group pllts it, “the technological com-
plexity of ICBM systems makes mechanical error a real
possibility. Human error or mental confusion Could trigger
a nuclear war.”

This is a nice way of saying that the whole future.

of mankind depends not upon great dictators or leaders;
not upon masses of people bllt lipon individual, isolated
military people on both sides.

Many of these people have had a bad case of trigger
finger for cars and in situations such as the one boling
now iii Europe, they undoubtedly become all the more
anxious to ”do it.”

This power, of course, must be taken all'ay from the
military before it is too late. There is one way and olllv
one way in which this can be done. Disarmament. Mutual,
total disarmament.

It is time to quit dropping proposals and then wait-
ing for the other tie to adopt the proposals. it is time to

disarm without waiting for the other side to follow. It)

can’t be done ill a day or a yeai, but it can be done.

Tt will be the biggest gamble this country ever took.
It will make all other gambles ill history look small ill com-
parison. The U. S. may loose the gamble. \\'c should have
no illusions about this.

But if the gamble isn't taken. things will go from
bad to worse. The race will go on. Each side wll continue
to dare the other until one day that dare is deliberately or

gllessers

By six votes, liberal, supposedly Democratic Grinnell
decided yesterday that Richard Nixon should be the next
President of the United States.

Assuming that C 'illllell students would follow natio al
trends, the Pal ' incident could have provoked a reaction
against changing horses ill the middle of a mild hole.

This may have been especially true considering Nixon's
meetings with Khrushchev last year.

The fact that Stevenson is a two-Lillie loser prob
ably had a lot to do with the vote. The old problem of thc
“imagcrnian” undoubtedly influenced many students.

A two-time loser and a Catholic running ag inst an
experienced national politician and a young, popular liberal
makes a difference. even among college Students who slip-
posedly aren’t influenced by such things.

At any rate the myth of Democratic Grillnell has been
badly damaged if not completely destroyed.

while we do not question the
‘ value of these "social" qucsr
‘ tions, we cannot help but be
intrigued and slightly disturbed
l by the phrasing, weighting and
obviulls bias of the questions. ,

I For instance, question 44 to bcl

Questions ed. ii and 43 were}
biased similar . For example,‘
question 39 read “I ‘icel the ex-j
tension of the women's visiting
.privilcpo in men's rlubi-ooms has
interfered wltli the men‘s use or

Not being acquainted with
[he them‘ies of opinion samp-
ling we don’t know how quan—
titatively this phrasing will
effect the result Validity, but
it is certain to have some effect.

it is also puzzling why a ques~
tioniialic “designed Io obtain in-
lormation conccrnlng student all
itltudcs, opinions and behaviors"
did not sample opinion on such
issues as alternating dorms,
women's hours, the car rule and
"uther important and contrcvei»
sial subjects.

it would seem that such

questions should have been
given preference over those
concerning “paid upperclnss
. prortors to help maintain quiet
hours," ncod ior more vocation-
al counseling and the “right
kind oi llollscninthcr" in each
hall.

Even with the slant and lack
of more pertinent questions. the
results or thc questionnaire
should be published. Also. pm-
haps another more oblective and

taken.
