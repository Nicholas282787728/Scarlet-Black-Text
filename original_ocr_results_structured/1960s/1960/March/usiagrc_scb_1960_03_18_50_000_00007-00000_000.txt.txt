This is in part a tribute to mono and in part a tribute
to the swimming team. Simone is a coach who ranks among
the best in the business, no matter- where he may apply his
talents.

He is a teacher who is, above all, etieetivo at taking the
athletes he has and getting them in the best possible shape,
improving their techniques until they can deliver the best pet

“While no special p - rcnce should be given applicants on
the basis or athletic ability, the committee i-ccommciided that
Harvard continue to give attention to athletic rating ‘oncc the
question or intellectual competence has been squarely faced.'” ‘1

The report also noted that intelligence and athletic endeavorl
were related as the 'nning iootball and soccer team; or 1959;
