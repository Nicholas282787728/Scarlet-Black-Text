Readers Discuss Aid, Race Problem, Chaining.

To the Editor:

We received our copies of the
1960 College Bulletin today, and
were considering the section on
financial assistance, under sclloIr
ai-ships and gl‘ams-lnraid: Gcnr
eral Policies, page 53. We quote:

”Scholarships and grants are
awarded subject to the following
conditions: When a student ac.
cepts a scholarship or grant, the
college expects him to fulfill all
the requirements for a Grinnell
degree, and the student assumes
an obligation to fulfill this site
peetation. if he transfers to an-
other college prior to his gradu»
ation from Grinnell, all money
he has received in scholarships
or grants—maid shall be due to
be repaid immediately. A trans-
cript of the student's record is
not issued until all his financial
obligations to the college are
discharged.” Of course, there is
a footnote to the effect that this
rule applies only to students ad—
mitted in 1959 or later.

We upperelassmen are not
affected by this ruling, but it
seems to us to be unjust to
apply, it to any student for
this reason: normally, any stu—
dent who comes to Grinnell
and needs financial assistance
to do so, appreciates the high
value of the undergraduate
program here.

So we submit that lie
normal student) has the inten

clan of attending Grinllell felt

the entire four years or arrang—
ing for a 3.2 program, for
which he would be exempt from
the rule.

However, suppose that our hye
pothetical student were forced
by sudden financial loss or im—
palrment of family income to
leave here temporarily or to at
tend another institution of low.
er cost. In this event our stu—
dent would have not only the
financial burden of the loss and
the change—over. but he would
also owe Grinnell college up to
several thousand dollars, payable
immediately.

We submit that the greatest
percentage of financially assists
ed students who do leave do
not necessarily wish to leave,
but are, perhaps, forced to by
financial circumstances.

Thus the effect of the alone

mentioned ruling would be to i

make the burden of such a
loss greater proportionally to
its original weight. Indeed, it
might very well force our stu-
dent to conclude his education
before eaming his degree.

This, as we all know, would
most probably have an adverse
effect on his earning ability
(since not quite a B.A. is equiv-
alent on paper to a high school
diploma), and might make a
waste of several years and a

So we believe that this ruling:
is discriminatory and unjust. We'
would like to see (or hear) a
rebuttal to this statement or at
least some indication that it 15‘

To the Editor:

The distrust, hesitancy and
complacency of the Grinnell
student of both races conccrm
ing the work of the committee
on race relations is disheart-
ening, to say the least. While!
other colleges are demonstrating‘
and giving financial and, we are
only asking for student approval!
of such efforts. '

The petition ior support of
the sit-in demonstrations and ,
non-violent activities 0[ the i
students in the South was i
misunderstood or ignored by i
many students here. ‘

Certainly we did not want
students signing without think--
ing, nor did we expect seg-i
regationists to sign; but it was
the “liberal” students who rc-
fuscd. to sign. Their reasons,
were many. They did not wantl
,to “get. involved" or felt it was‘
none of their business. l

In"the first place. there is
nothing to get involved in since‘
the petitions are only to go to

ongressnien and presidential
lcandidatcs in an endeavor to
lshow our sympathy with the
iproblem.

l In the second place, if it
l isn't our business, whose is
. it? It is selfish and narrow-
iniiided to evade the issue in
. this way. We may be too
idealistic, too far from the
. problem and too impractical;
i but someone has to try, and
.3 that’s the best part of it, the
willingness to try to help.

Ii'ealize that some Negroes
will feel uncomfortable and,
‘even bitter when confronted
‘wllh issues such as this.hut i
feel we must go ahead anywayl
iand hope that somewhere it’
may do some good.

A person’s quick refusal or

denying himself his own priv-

his own powers and powers
granted to him by his state.

The petition states that “I,

The petition will be sent to

Many people who believe in
“civil rights" will not sign be-

comment in approval of the NC—

we are agreeing l

the Bible says you are asleep
and dead to the possibility of
lasting peace and Joy. ”Awake.
and arise from the dead! God
who commandeth the light to
shine out of darkness shall shine ,

To the Elllto

If I am thirsty and I am black
and happen to be in the South
at the time. I have two a]-
ternativcs: 1) continue being
thirsty, 01‘ 2) slake my thirst
in unusual human fashion, only
from a water fountain inno-
cuously labeled “Colored only,"

You would be amazed how
easy it is not to notice that
little Sign. Some Negroes
wanting a drink of water have
even developed the effective
system of closing their eyes
while they drink. So you can
hardly say that they’re un-
happy with the system.
