The biggest question which i
1960 will answer ior Ceylon :
will not not go unanswered i
as many other problems
might, for on the evening oi
March 19 the results or the
general elections will till the
air via Radio Ceylon. And
ALL of Ceylon will he Iistcn-
ing. Will Ceylon swing toe
ward the right, returning the
United National Party, with a
majority in the enlarged Par» .
liamcnt 01 151 seats? other
alternatives are many.
Ceylon has 23 registered pai‘rl
tics, and a large number orl
“independents” will further add
to the Voter’s dirticulty in as-
serting his choice chectively.
Will a coalition government be
necessary or will some party-
have a clear-cut majority? will‘
the Communists be defeated
again as they were in the Co-}
ltimbo municipal elections 10
days ago? is the Sri Lanka'
Freedom Party lorineol by thel
'latc prime minister “dead” orI
will it “surprise the country,"

cently said? Then there is the
present prime ministers new

have the people had enough of

And on top of all those ques-
tions remains one raised by the
astrologers prediction that
March 19 is a “bad" day tor,
the election; hence, that thel
elected Farhament will not sur-
viva to the end of its ﬁve-year
life, This is a serious matter
in Ceylon, [for no governmentl
