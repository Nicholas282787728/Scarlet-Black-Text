iiour have been met before, as
in the New Deal and the Seas
and World War," Buwles said,
“and the new President must
not avoid the new challenges
that will be iaeed in 1961."
He outlined the premise that
during the first few years oi
the President's term he must

display leadership and decisive‘

action to “win over the oppOSle
tion and retain solidified sup~
port.” The new President must
also set to set up his programs
in the first few years of admin—
istration.

“One of thc primary purposes
or the new President will be
to act as an educative force in
an attempt to large a national
sense of purpose and direction,"
he said

Education act,"

Grinnell took the lead among
colleges and universities in
pointing out that the oath
and disclaimer required from
borrowers were unnecessary,
ambiguous and damaging to
open discussion and academic
ii-cedom.

The loans were turned down
*by the college last spring, and
the College’s stand was recently
discussed and clariﬁed by both
Bowen and the students. Student
council president Duane Krohn-
ke was instrumental'in bringing
the matter to the attention of
Grinnell students and council
pro 'dents from other Midwest
