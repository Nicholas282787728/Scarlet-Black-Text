U. 5. Foreign Dealings

U. S. DEALINGS

Cont. from p. 4

to hold underground nuclear
tests that would be undectablc,
by a plan similar to the 1307
station system; even the pl'cpdl'»
ation for thc "hole” method
would be dctcclablc.

Furthermore, in addition to
this record of false propagan-
da, there is the claim that the
Americans held as prisoners
in China are being held illeg—
ally, that it is typical of
Communist treachery, etc. But
this is not true.

That these has have been nec»
essay is doubtful, For in all
this time, it is the Americanl

. people who have been most talc
en-in. How can we possibly
claim the Russians have no rea—
son to mistrust us or fear Us?

They had no reason to beiievci‘
us; they have pointed out our
inconsistencies, our lies. Thati
they have misrepresented facts
and have lied in the past does
not excuse us if we are to claim
we are better than they.

There are many conclusions to
be drawn, and some of them are
frightening; but they must he
shot. I have not space to debate
the armaments race and the
duping that we have received
concerning it, including the idea
that our spying by plane, es
pecially in light of the photo-
graphs of a recent "‘weather’“
satellite, is still necessary.

It should be evident from!
recent events that our leaders l
are incompetent. They do not
seem to be able to pursue any
line that will he of value to us
or the world in the long run.

It is much more frightening
that our elected officials do noti
have control of our policies in!
the forming and the execution
of them nor even seem aware
of their blundering, stupidity,
lack of direction and lack of
control, '

Our leaders still seem to see
nothing shocking about the pme
vocative action that a “routine"
flight is bad, especially before a
summit conference. instead, they
are shocked that they are not
praised for their stupidity andi
their “honesty” of admitting‘
something that any intelligent
person could hardly avoid sca—
ing.

But there is an even worse,
more frightening possibilit -
that our leaders, elected or
not, are either- helpless before
others who insist on pursuing
militaristic policies, lies andr
self-aggrandizement at the ,
peril of our country and the
world, or that our leaders are
even in an iniormal collusion
to follow the aforesaid.

This should not be such ,

. shocking conclusion, it could cx—i
plain the reason why we inten-i
tionally ilcw 1200 miles into

 

vnew goals will he set and the

a past,

Ru. bciorc El unlnlit confer
cnee. (In a way, one would prov}
for Uulrlght \lllalny tlizln vil-,
lainy due to incompetence.)
Our society has been typed
with the “organization man.‘Y
These status seekers and status
keeper individuals do not like
change. And there would cer~
tainly be a change if the arma—
ments race would be stopped.

That it is evident irom the re—
sults and
-from the disarmament coiiicra
ences that such agoalisachieve-
able and soon would be
enough to move these people to
throw a wrench into it. Rather
shocking, is it? Yes.

But one must remember that
such people have a very nar-
row vision of life and a
strange faith that if all is to
be well, the status quo, i.e.,
the keeping of their position,
and career, must he kept at
(Ill possible costs.

To them freedom is irrelevant
it is the Job, the money and
the club that are important.
These people having similar
ideas, backgrounds and lutures
almost naturally agree withuu‘
any effort that the status quo
is best.

For it armaments are cut, the”,
businesses will have to change,l

l

military career-ists will losc‘

prestige and jobs. Thus, to keep
their status, they will light for
it unless we make it intolerable
for them,

Whether we can force them
to quit, to accept a new world]
without their services is a ques-
tion for the future. A change of
party in power does not mean
that a change in leadership will
actually occur. We do not elect‘
the military, the business lead»
are or even most of the officials.

Furthermore, both the Dem-
ocrats and the Republicans
are dominated with similar
types. It before thc next elec— i
tions the lcadership of one of
the parties were completely
replaced w i t h constructive
leaders who would meet the
Russians as objective, respon—
sible leaders, there might be
a chance. ,

But this is doubtlul. It is fur—
ther doubtful whether a third
party can be organized and be—
come strong enough to challenge
them or replace one of them in
the next four years, let alone
that much time,

To expect that our leaders
Will reform themselvcs’is less
likely than Iowa’s achieving fair
reapportionment through the
state legislature. The future is
going to he rougher on demure»
racy in this country than the

which has done much to
cinasculatc it. The future is at
pessimist's nightmare. ,
