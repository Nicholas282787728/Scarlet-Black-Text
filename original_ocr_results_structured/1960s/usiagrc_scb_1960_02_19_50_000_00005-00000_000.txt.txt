Pioneers Face
Coe Mal'men

by Ken Kramer

Darby gym will he the scene
of wrestling action tomorrow as-
ternoon at 1:30 when a deter-
mined Grinnell squad will be
pitted against the million of Coe
college.

Coach. Bob ‘Peterson, Pioneer
"grunt and groan" strategist,
says that he has had “no re-
lease on (Coe’s) personneL" He
added that at the present time
the Kohawks have “no one at
123 (lbs) or at 130 (“35.) so
that Grillllell will probably go
into the meet with an auto-
matic ll) points."

A tentative starting roster has

- been released to the Scarlet and
Black. The matmen will'be head-
cd by undefeated Dick Harris at
167. Other starters will be Mike
Bachmann, 123; Bill Patton, 130;
Mike Burr, 137; Dave Manley,
147; Ron Dorr, 157; Jerry Born,
Karl Krumel or Dick Urhricht
177; and Born or Ulbrioht, hea-

vyweight.

Also slated to see action are
lreshrnen Wayne Ganoandhill
Montiort, who will compete in
exhibition matches.

A relatively unknown fac't
about Midwest conference wrest.
ling is that dual meets do not
help .to determine conference
standings. These standings are
all determined at the annual con-
ference meet. This year's most
will be held March 5 and 6 at
Lawrence college, Appleton, Wis.

been the best this season, but

 

by Dale Furnish

Dent look now, but Coach Irv Simone has a freshman
swimming team ﬁlial. is amdng the best he has ever had at
this school Having beaten the Carleton yearlings in a postal
swimming meet earlier in the year by an ll point margin, the
freshmen journeyed in Monmouth Ill last Wednesday to whale
the dickens out of Monmouth and Cornell. The Knox freshmen
were? also scheduled to show up for this meet but were unable
to 0 so.

At any rate, Simones ﬁrst year men must enter the fresh-

, l'nan clonference meet, which is a. postal arrair, as deiinlte fav-

orites to walk off with their third straight title1 Carleton is
rated as the (0)) power in the north and Knox holds that dis-
tinction along with GI’iluIelI in the Southn

a c e 1.

Simone, not content to Stop inventing things after his suc—
cess with the mechanical Inbbii,, also has a new weight training
device for his swimmers It conSIsts of a sled which moves along
a tlack with weights before and behind.

The swimmer lies on the sled and grasps weights in iront
0f him Then with a mution close to that used to pull through
the water, the athlete pulls himself and the sled toward the for-
ward weights. The weights behind provide resistance to the pull.
The device can be adapted m any stroke.

The Pioneers volatile cage mentzm’, Ilohn Pillsch, not to be
outdone by Simone‘s inventive genius, has come up with an
innovation or his own. It is the ball rack that may be seen on
display at all of the Gl‘lnnell home games.

Made out of electrical pipe tubing and mounted on wheels,
the hOldEl boasts bicycle hand gIIpS and an unending fascination
for anyone who wants tn spend his time scooping basketballs
out of the lower trough and rolling them down through again.
ll is not now known whether Piitsch will seek a patent on the

Grinnell‘s basketball team sports no more than a subspar 6-9
record in the Midwest conference, but one of the big reasons,
for that may be the almost. unbelievable ability of their oppon~
ents to play at their very best against the Pioneers.

No less than six league foes have hit their best shooting
percentages of the season in healing Grinnell. Carleton, CDT-
nell, Knox, Lawrence, Ripon and SL Ola! have all poured
baskets through the hoop at proliiic rates while in action against
John Pfitsch's charges

The cagers, though they are presently hitting a very respec-
table 43 percent for the season, have been unable to offset the
shooting mentioned above, the lowest percentage among those

Leave For Minneso_la Triangular

Grillllell swimmers have
now humbled two Big Eight
opponents and are within
two meets of carrying an
undefeated record into the
Midwest conference swim
championships two weeks
from new.

Challenging the Pioneer tank-
ers tomorrow at st. Peter, Minn.,
Will he the swimmers of Gus-
tavus Adolphus and illinois
Normal colleges. The meet is an
annual event which usually in-
Monmoutlr as well as
the nonconference foes.

The rivaIl-y between Grin-
noll and Gustavus Adolphus
is particularly keen. While
Pioneer squads have been
dominating the Midwest com
rerencc, the Gusties have been
splashing to ﬁve crowns in

the Minnesota intercollegiate '

contereuce. Last year the ver-
dict went to Grinnell in a
close decision; the year he-
rore it was Gustavus Adol-
phus who won a tight meet.
Gustavus, which allows 1ts
freshmen to swim varsity, has
the depth and power to swim
with Coach lrv Simone’s men
In almost every event, while
illinois Normal must rely on a
few individuals ior the major-
ity of its points The Illinois
school has some depth, but its
top performers are a back»
stroker, who is consistently be-
low 2.20, and is a good threat
to the Pioneers swlit and pow-
erful Art Johnson and a superr
lative hreastroker named Sch-
rieber, who holds the Grinnell
pool record

Next Thursday Grinnell
closes out its regular season
at Cornell college This meet
will decide possession or Dllly
the Duck, a wooden decoy
who has graced the Pioneer
trophy case six or the last
seven years and is awarded
annually to the Midwest con-
ference team compiling the
best record In dual meets in«
volving league competition.
Last weekend Grinnell dis-
posed of Nebraska and Cole-
rado with surprising ease in a
triangular swimming meet. Pio-
neer tankers piled up so points
to 54 ior Nebraska and 34 tor
Colorado, and won all events
except diving and the zoo yard
breaststroke.
