Schwengel Glitters Says Little

We were told by Conglesslnan Fled Sehwengel that
the Pepublican palty is a “folce' fol plogiwess because
three years ago some committee in Washington publish—
ed a booklet (95¢ retail) listing various idealistic solu-
tions to the nation’s problems. When he wasn’t quoting
from the booklet, Schwengel was either quoting from Carl
Sandburg or from Abraham Lincoln.

We heard (for tile 100th time) the story of a little
Negro boy kneeling in f1ont of the Lincoln memorial whis-
pering, “Thank you, M1 Lincoln ” We heard a very melo~
dramatic justification of the United States playing a role
in world affails, based on Lafayette's assistance duling the
Revolutionary war and the contribution made to the
United States during the lztst 150 years by foreign immi-
grants.

While we do not take issue with Schwengel’s good
intentions or his ability to legislate, we fail to See how any
politician could hope to impress upon intelligent citizens
the importance of politics and the virtues of his pzuty Vl 1th
a line of Such stale geneialities and trite justifications
as was presented in the speech lasti Monday night.

and so cannot be considered as
“critical.” This is not to say that
good criticism cannot be made in
a humorous vein but simply that
even the funniest satire must
have a serious foundation if It is
to be considered important.

Rather than any of these, thc
”Rebellion" seems merely to bc
jeering at Grinnell, its institu-
tions and at”almost every ac—
cessible individual for no appars
ent reason. At least if there are
reasons, it assumes that these
aie unimportant and concen.
trates on s‘eeing how many “be
low the belt" punches it can
pull within its limited space.

As you have probably guess-
ed, I feel that the "Rebellion"
is almost: completely ineffec~
tual. 1 base uiis feeling, in part,
on the following statements.

(1) it deals with admittedly
serious problems in a dcploi»

The “Grinnellian Rebels
lion” is defunct!

I say this from the point of
view of the “Rebellion" itself.
For all practical purposes, it
seems to forward uie proposi-
tion that ‘all Grinnell i stitutions
are in effect “defunc ,’ and so
by this very suppositon, it is
Cutting its own throat along with
those of Everyone else.

It is really quite difficult to
know just bow to go about a dis
cussionrof the “Rebellion.”

One can certainly not ap-
proach it from a literary stand-
point. There is no literature to
be found in it.

If, as “A Letter. From the
Editor” in Vol. 1, No. 5 suggests,
we are supposed to receive it as
a “humor magazine," I suppose
it should be dealt with from this
angle. But here too, one is quick-
ly discouraged, for the ”humor”
is just not funny. Grotesque—
maybc. distastefulscertainly, but

Notes From
The
Underground

; by Naida Tushnet

Boom! And another country
gets the bomb. Bang! American
ingenuityl Boom! Russian supe-
riority! Boom! Booml Boom!

And now all the earth's Vast.»
ncss has been ﬁlled. All the
great Isolated areas are connect-
ed: the American desert, Siberia,
the Sahara. No emptiness, no es-
cape from it. The atmosphere
is pervaded with all that is
given off as the beautiful uriay

of colors and the mushroom
cloud appear.

Edward Teller says there is
nothing to fear. The amount
of radiation in the atmosphere
increases, but we shouldn‘t be
afraid: it‘s harmless Nonethe-
less, I am scared.

Just what is it that I fear
from fallout? What is wrong
with Strontium 90? What can it
do? It ciin't give us children
with 18 heads, true (cells with
genes mutated in this weird way
would be ineffective in union),
but some malformed births have
already been traced to areas of
high radioactivity. Even those
of us lucky to be born already
can bc hitileulfemia, bone can.
cer-‘the horrible incurables are
likely lesults of exposure
fallout

Eut Admiral Rickovcr says
it's not dangerous yet: we
have not reached the “thresh-
old" of danger. Besides this,
we have reason not to ’stop
testing now, because if we did
the Russians would get ahead

(Get ahead: Man, you’d bet—
ter open your eyes.)

No, they say, we still have a
lot of time before danger strikes.
And anyway, now we have a
bomb which is 97 percent clean!
(Has anyone stopped to think
that 97 percent clean is three
pcrccnt more dirty than no
bomb ‘at all? And if three per—
ccnt adds up on a savings ac-
count intcrcst, it certainly adds
up with Strontium 90, etc.

Another argument raised by
men who aren’t in the market
for a Nobel Peace prize is that
actually the continual testing
and stockpiling will prevent a
World War III. The world will
not end with a “bang" if we
kccp testing. perhaps, though,
life will “whimper” o‘ut duc to
diseases caused by fallout,

I might be ﬁle to accept
this logic if‘countries involved
seemed scared enough of what
they‘ve got. But they're not-—
we're “atoniizlng world peace"
by indiscriminately giving gifts

The title would suggest that
it aims at some kind of social
comment—that it is trying to
meet some need for ”form 0‘
one sort or another. If this is
the case, 1 only have to say
that it does not merit any con-
cern Whatever.

It is impossible to find any
serious attempt in this respect

To the Editor:

A recent article 1n the news»
paper concerning the African
(state of Guinea has caught our
eye. Combining with a number
of other factors engaging our
attention, it has crystallized into
a proposal that we want to lay
bcforc the Grinnell students.

Let us sketch in the other
factors before we get to Guinea
and the proposal. We confess
to a sense of dismay as we
survey the world in which we
live—the threat of ICBM'S and
nuclear warfare, the noisy ad—
vance of communism, the more
silent “explosion” of popula-
tion.

We are yet more dismayed as

we observe the utter lack of
imaginatlve responsc to the un.
paralleled dangers surrounding
us, the dead pail of complacency
that is st1f1ing our national
existence, Wlth others we agree
that “a sense of nahonal pur-
pose“ is lacking, and we too
sometimes feel impotent to work
effectively toward the solution
of apparently overwhelming
problems.
i And yet we are unwilling to
accept such_ :1 conclusion. We
do not believe that men are
incapable of affecting their
collective destiny. We belicvc
i that in this country a reser-
voir of idealism lies waiting
to be tapped.

While we welcome any crca.
tive initiative that may come
from govcrnmcnt leaders, we be-l
lieve that our pred1camcut re-
lquires the emergence of grass—
lroots loader-ship from hundreds

I

land thousands of places across
the country. Grinnell college,
with its tradition of pioneering,
of idealism, and ofservicc, ought
lto be one of those places.
According to a recent news-
paper fenture, the newly in~ ‘
dependent state of Guinea .
(formerly a French colony)
has been trying in vain for :
some time to get 50 people to

 

come there to teach English.
It is clear that the methods ,
adopted by the under-devei. ,
oped countries such as Guinea

to facilitate their entry into 1
foundly affect the future char- 1
acter of the world. Does any» ,
one doubt that if they con»

tinue to ask in vain, they will

request and have no difficul-

ty in securing 50 people to

tench Russian?

the modern world will pro- 1‘

[are

giblc opportunity for Grinnel
students to make a real contri
bution to the shaping of th
world. We are certain that thi
is but one of many opportuni
ties for significant aid to under
developed countries by larg
numbers of idealistic, courage
ous and cncrgetic youths.

By offering at year of service
abroad, young people could
make a positive contribution
to the advancement of the
struggling peoples of theworld
and at the same time make a
positive contribution to the se-
curity of their own country.
By serving and sharing before
they settle down into the dull
routine of consuming and en—
joying, they might acquire the
sense of purpose so painfully
absent in our lives. Their ex-
ample might even have re—
percussions beyond their own
immediate sphere.

Students intercsted‘in lookin
further into this or Similar op
portunities are invited to can
suit with either of us. This i.
an endeavor that the Committet
on the International Studi
Program and the IRC might wel
wish to sponsor and promote.
