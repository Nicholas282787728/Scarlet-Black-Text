~tit doesn't follow that
God imsclt is a kind ol
philosophical universal. God is
singular.” Speaking oi platonic
universality. he explained that
“universally theretore does not
altogether exclude and is not
the complete antithesis ol the
notion ot peculiarity.

“For Toynbcc,
Dr. Casscrley, “the higher i'eligs
ions share a valuable approx

Cassei'lev

malion that the truth about God

is neither here nor there, He
is always imprisoned in His ins
etiable everywhere," He notes
the paradox in Toynbee ot the
historian who insists on taking a
religious view ot history while
declining to take a historcal
vew of religion This, according

to Dr Cassei‘ley, is thC most im< ‘

portant criticism ot the Toyn-
bean synthesis.

“Religion contributes much to
our understanding ot history,"
he continued, “but particularly
events ot winch history is com—
posed inhabit a world ot lucab
ity and restrict in space and
time that which is ultimately
irrelevant to religion. God in-
habits non-time. From this pointi
ot,view,'l he went on, "the gult
between God and man is meta-
physical, and neither man nor
God can cross it i

Dr. Casserley concluded by
saying, "There was a relations
ship between the philosophy of
history and the philosophy or
religion, it we are not to lake]
historical view or religion. we'
can hardly take a religious view
ot histo y, Only if God can‘
really act in history can maul
significantly exist betore God
in eternity."

The tinal and perhaps most
important lecture in the
Gates series was presented
Wednesday morning at 11, by
Dr. Casserley, speaking about
"The Ontology of History”!

(“the status ot historical
drama in the order :Ind Scale
of reality“).

Dr. Cassel‘ley explained his;
use of the word “drama” rathcrl
than “process," bEcause of a ran
lated impersonaiity ot the latel
ter, "Our modern apathetic taI-l
lacy." he said, ‘1: an almost with
ful mispereeption and miscon-
ception of a plain reality. The
personal just cannot be de-
personaiized without doing Vio-l
lenee to the most obvious of
jacts.” l

l

Though history contains‘

"trends of development which
can be

intellectually abstracted

 

from concrete history and trans. .

lated as processes, history cons
sidered as a whole is a per-
sonal drama,” he added.

Dr. Casscrley continued his
introduction by saying he wouldl
consider the Christian and Bibi-
cal account of history here, beef
cause it is “the success oi this
account ot history considered,
simply as a penetrating inter-‘

lpretatioii of history, which vcr—l
itics the initial hypothesis that
history is such that revelation
can DCCI ."

In providing this account, he
rcieri-ed to three basic
gorlcs 0[ thought: escatology.
time and eternity and freedom

Escatology, or the know
ledge oi thc last thing- or
things, in Christianity is otteii
“a bclict that the historical ‘
order will culminate in some i
catastrophic end, which is at
the same time a new begiir
ning, the kingdom oi God,"
Dr, Casserley pointed out.

He went on to suggest that
:“the essential characteristic oi
iChr tian existence is the pr
carious consciousness ot exist-j
‘ing on the edge of the world";

“The great
‘judgment and redemption. is,
the Christian, 'specious present',
in which lite is now being lived]

taking place
time are not only
moments oi our own existence,
but transcended, cumulative
moments tor the divine cons
sclousness.”

"The modern use of the word
‘Crlsls’ is also significant," ac.
cording to Casserley. We speak
at “our world passing through
a crisis. The Christian life,” he
said, “is in constant crisis, and
though living in crisis is une
comfortable. it is a more stimu-
iotig and exciting existence than
‘peace of mind’ . . . it is pos-
sible that we are all going to be
blown to bits, but at least means
while we are not going to be

bored” ‘

“,"Man according to Dr. Cas-l
serlcy, "knows eternity now,‘
and he experiences time as a
succession ot what we may call
tinite moments so that in IimE'
his experience has some charac—

teristics ot eternity. History is;

:the teiilpui‘ality of the eternal".

"lf'liistory," he went on, “is:
a temporaiizing of the eternal}
so religion in the tullest sensel
is an eternalizing of the tom-i
poral Thus." he concluded,l
”there is between history and‘

Biblical revealed religion a cor—i
tain innate reciprocity. There is_

no making sense oi either with;
out reference to the other, Reel
ligion is historical, and history‘
is religious.” :
Dr. Casserlcy's second topic
considered the notion of time
and eternity, He spoke or .
duration as the specious pres-
ent or the Christian niow — :

He went on to explain this
“the intention of eternity
the eternity ot God means‘
that [or Him the entire coui

ot tcmporaiity is gathered illto’
one single specious present.
Eternity time transcended but
neither ime nullitied nor ig-
nored. And." he added, “man
himscll poi-takes to a small but
signilicant extent or this kind
or eternity. Human experience
is again and again an experience}
oi transcendence, i.e,, to stand.
apart lrom oneselt and know‘
oneself.” ‘

”As wc experience it, treetloin‘

These words began the consi

his third topic

freedom. l

Speaking about causality and

tion of causality in
state any possible doctrine ot
human irecdom

"The past looks detci-ininedl
because it is torever fixed," said,
Dr. Casserley, “The tuture can,
at least be thought of as de-l
terniined because, not yet haw‘
ing expcrienced it. i am free
to think of it in any way that
i choose. And," he went on,
“the now 1 experience is tree.
for the now is the concrete
actuality engaged in the very
moment oi its bricl passage ini
imposing its tiny quota or causal
power upon the course of

events.” I

Dr. Casserley added, however,
"The causality we experience in
our trecdom is very lrnii. Absos
lute ireedom can only be nttii
buted to God alone"

in this way, thr Gates
lecturer suggested that all his-
tory is the history ot treedom,
“not in the sense that it is the
history oi man’s gradual
achievement of freedom. rather
all history is the history of
God's ircedom."

And concluding, Dr. Crisscl‘lcy.
'n the last words ot his 1960‘
Gates Lecture series said, “The
privilege of living as a chniactem
in an epic can hardly tail to be as
only with a gl‘eatl
sum can a man attain this tree»
dom. But though the pains may
well be terrible, the compensa-
tions can hardly tail to be ins
tinitely and eternally worth—l
while.”
