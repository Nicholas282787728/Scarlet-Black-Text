it ltls Time lo Disarm

One of the arguments suggested by those who are
against nuclear disarmament by tlle.United, States nms
its follows: If Russia and the Us. were to disarm, the
doors would be opened for rl “regular” war. "

As soon as that war began the argument presumes
that another war would, almost \ itllout :t doubt, begin,
the two nations would pull their formulas it of math-
lbulls and the world would be thrown into a mill-scale nu-
clear war.

 

These people contend that by remaining armed to the‘

'knowing that the victor will not enjoy the radioactive
‘ spoils. '

i There is some reason to believe in the assumption that
tneitllel' side will risk it wnr because‘of the Consequences.

But again we must quote from one, of the many groups

lillvolved in research oil the problem. “The technological
complexity of ICBM systems makes meclld 'cal ('1 or a
ll'eal possibility. Human Error or mental confusion c llld
trigger it llucledl “'1 "’ .
i This statement is selfne planntol‘y and reasonable i
‘its prediction of possible wal provoking accidents with m
,cleiir weapons. The thought of purposely starting a rule] .
lu'zir is bad enough, but the thought of plunging mall-kind
iinto total (listrtlction by mistake is tern y ng and sicken-
lllg. ., .
It is for this reason, besides the» fact that deliberate
atomic attack isn’t as impossible 215 some people'woultl like
1to believe, that it is time for the American people to d_
’mnnd of their government that some definite concrete
step be taken toward llucle-r disarmament.

As we have stated betol'e,iit is time to quit propos-
-inc' various plans and then waiting for the other side to
21 es and follow. . \
The United Stutes should take the first step. This
country should scrap part of its nuclear pile and give to the
‘entll'e \\'(ll'l(l the evidence that it has done so. The Russians
tcould not afford to ignore such a powerful piece of prop-
. zigalldu. -"

The best possible result of such a decision is that it
lwould :1 us the unquestioned moi-ill leadership of an ape
ll‘ll‘ellellSlVe world. that Russia would follow our example
lbecdllse of its tleclured‘ezlgerness ’to compete [and surpass
'on grounds other than armed m lit and that all could ttll'll
to the solution of humanity’s pressing problems.

He ”duCnl'M- minted out that these deliberately tempt u l' and destruction?

. It would seem tlilit’ there s less of a chance involved
till the former action. Russia would like to see the US.
‘tllltlel' communistic domination just as it would like to see
the rest of the world in the same situation, just as we
would 1er to sec 21 world guided by democracy or demos

ll some of the tension and fear now present under

ltllo llllclezll' threat were 9 lsetl through a definite commit-i

iillcnt by both sides-to disarmament, the competition be-

tween East and West could be directed through economic
and social channels by aid to underdeveloped countries and
to underdeveloped areas of the cultures and societies of the
imol‘é wealthy nations.

1 This would seem on much more feasible and sensible
course of nation than waiting for and inviting d nuclear
mistake.
