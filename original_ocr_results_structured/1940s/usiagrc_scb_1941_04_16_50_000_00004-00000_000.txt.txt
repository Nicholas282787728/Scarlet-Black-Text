Emoiional Causes
Of Flunks Lis‘lecl
By lndiana Dean

TERRE HAUTE, IND 7mm?)—
Emotional upset causes more_stu-
dent failures in college than either
academic incompetence oi- laziness
in lcaming subject matter.

That is the opinion of Dr. Gwy-
lym Isaac, dean of the department
of philosophy and student couns
seller at Indiana State Teachers
college.

Students are more disturbed by
family troubles than by any other
worries, including their own love
affair, and the grades of many
good students have nose-dived
when their parents at home were
breaking up, Dr. Isaac asserts.

Dr. Isaac says it is harder to
reason with students bothered by
their family affairs than those
with any other trouble. Usually
one good commonsense discussion
solves the troubles of collegiaiis
worrying about love affairs, the
second greatest cause for poor
grades.

The third biggest worry- is over
money matters. Dr Isaac has dis-
covered.

Twelve Potential
Omelets L ea ve
Coeds Presents

By Jean Wallace

Dorothy Jane Childs, Read junior,
won a pink Easter rabbit for
herself Sunday morning when she
found more Easter eggs than
anyone else in the quadrangle.

The occasmn for the search was
the first Easter egg hunt ever
sponsored by the League Board
and might well become an annual
occasion here, except that, accord»
ing to Jean Heinsen, new League
Board president, Grmnell will not
be in session when Easter comes
next year.

There were innumerable candy
eggs to he found, but only 12
potential omelets of which a hen
would be proud were in circula-
tion during die hunt. To the
finders of the 12 “iegitimates”
went the prizes~candy eggs,
candy rabbits, and baby chicks.

Reports are not complete re-
garding the future of the chicks,
but late bulletins indicate‘that
one still lives on third Read while
another, stranded on third Mears,
has “disappeared."

Miss Child’s pink Easter bunny

"was given to J, Alfred Adams

and family as a pet. The rabbit
is behaving itself and still exists
in the singular, according to Mrs.
Adams.
