Report of \lioiations.

Any student observing another student in the
performance of an openly dishonest or questlollr
able act during an examination period should warn
the offending student that he should desist. It is
suggested that this warning be given by tapping a
pencil on the desk or by remark. If the person con—
tinues the same activity during the same examlmir
tion, the observing student should point out to the
offender that the Honor System has been violated.
The observer should ask the offender to report him-
self to a member of the Honor Court. After

A Quesiion of Honor

Grinnell college has always believed in promo-
ting ideas which develop individual integrity and
maturity. This practice has helped establish an
nell college as one of the finest educational inst
tutioiis in the United States, We believe that the
Honor \System is an indispensable part of this far-
reacning theory.

It is to the advsnaage of both students and
faculty members to maintain and improve this re-
cently established system. We would like to set
forth here the working principles of the Honor
Systm under which all hour or semester exams are
conducted.

Conduct in Examination Room.

All books, papers, notes, etc., should be left in
the front of the room. Students should sit in al-
teniate or well-spaced seats. Although students
may leave the room at any time, it is understood
that students will work as continuously as p055!-
ble. Conversation should not take place in the ex-
amination room, even if it does not apply to the
examination. Examination booklets and test ques~
tions should be left in the examination room durr
ing absences.

Pledge.

All students are requested to sign the follow-

twenty-four hours, the observer should ask the of-
fender if he has reported the violation. If the Vi0r
lation has not been reported, the observer should
make the report to the Honor Court.

Prepping

The word "prepping” has assumed unfortunate
connotations To many freshmen veterans it
smacks of an order to pick up cigarette butts in
the name of discipline. Misused aui/horlty is al—
ways a menace to a community; acts of servility
have no place in the Grinnell system.

Then why has prepping been a tradition of
Grinnell? The answer resolves about that veiled
phrase which has been kicked about the campuses
of America for many generationsASprit du corps.
It amounts to fratel‘nitykbrotherhuad. It is the
pride of the Gates man in his trophy case, the
pride of a Haiiies girl in her hockey bruises.

There is nothing terrifying about prepping
when it means clearing the clubroom for a Fl‘ir
day night dance, gathering wood for a football
bonfire, or wearing a freshman cap. A freshman
cap is a grouprbadge, as are Honor G sweaters
and Friars pins, proclaiming their own affiliations.
Upperclassmeh bolster their halls by making the
basketball squad, taking first in debate, or serv-
ing on the Board .of Religion. Freshmen are asked
only to keep up the hall graderpolm. average and
to assist in minor duties benefiting the hall andl
the school, i

Freshmen have a right to protest if they are
asked to perform menisleand meanlnglessiduties,
but they are violating the traditions of Grinnell if
they believe that an arrangement with the finance
office absolves them of all other collge responsr
bility. This is not a rich man‘s college, nor are the
halls Greek-letter fraternities.

prepping is an extracurricular freshman in-
doctrination course. It has endured because it per-
forms a basic function.
