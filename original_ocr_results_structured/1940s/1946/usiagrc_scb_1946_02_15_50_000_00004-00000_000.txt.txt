LAWRENCE GRABS WIN
IN FINAL MINUTE, 35-34

The scarlet colors of the Pioneers went into the red
Saturday night as they fell before Lawrence College 35-34

gym. The final score does not tell the full story of the
game, however, for with the score tied 34-34 2. Lawrence

With the game over, George McClellan, Lawrence forward,
sank his shot and pocketed a win for Lawrence.

ice in the first minute of play,‘
but an under the basket shot by
Williamson quickly brought the
Pioneers back into the game.
After five minutes of play the
visiting team was leading 12—10
until Jack Chaffee sank a near»
impossible shot to knot the score.
From that point until the half,
it was anybody's game, The half—
time whistle saw Grinnell leading
17—16.

Second Half
, The first half, while exciting
enough, could not match the
tempo of the Second Both teams
played excellent ball on defensc
and offense and with seven
minutes left in the game the
score stood 27725 with Lawrence
setting the pace. Williamson
answered with another of his
long shots, missed a foul, sank
another basket and the Pioneers

were again in the lead.

sent blood pressures soaring. With
Grinnell leading 30-29, Hall tied
the score on a foul shot. Two
quick shots by Lawrencemen
Curry and Hall left the Pioneers
four points behind. Dble Nelson'
reduced this lead to three points
on a free throw.

almanner to add up to total ex-

» cellent basketball.
