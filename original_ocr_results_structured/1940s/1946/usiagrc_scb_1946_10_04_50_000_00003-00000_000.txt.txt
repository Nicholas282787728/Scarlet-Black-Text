location in the Central game,
Coach Ben Douglas will use Mel

over Central‘s Flying Dutchmen.
The Pioneers were on the defen-
sive through most of the game,
but struck suddenly and devastar
tingly in the opening seconds of
the fourth quarter for their mare
gin of victory.

Grinnell had just gotten the
ball on an exchange of punts
when Fred Webb hit Steinbeck
with a flat pass near midfield.
Steinbeck gathered it in and car-
ried the ball to the Central 25
yard line before being stopped.
Ed Nagel smashed the center of
the Dutchman line for 15 yards.
Next play Steinbeck took it over.

That was the ball game. The
sturdy Grinnell line turned back
another Central threat late in the
last period. In the closing seconds
of the first half the Pioneer line
had risen to the occasion and tak-
en the ball on downs inside the
Grinncll 5 yard line.

It was the Flying Dutchman
passing attack which kept the
Pioneers in trouble with five
completions out of 14 attempts.
