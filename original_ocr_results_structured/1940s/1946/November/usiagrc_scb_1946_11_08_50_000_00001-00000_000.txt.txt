lVash Concludes 1946 Gates Lectures
On Christian Thought In College World F

Dr, Arnold Nash. chairman of
the church history department at
McCormack Theological Seminary
in Chicago. opened his five lec-
’in the annual Gates series.

Lures.
entitled "Christian Thought 1n
the College World Today." Tues-
day morning at an all college con-
vocation in Herrick chapel

The title of Dr. Nash's initial
speech was “A Coloney of Heav—
en”. during which he pointed out
numerous examples of diverse
groups of people. who, working
more or less by themselves. have
"recognized that their day-to-
day actions make them a ‘col-
any of heaven. in that they
have a definite loyalty to that
which transcends themselves,"

“Many have proved.” Dr. Nash
said. “that even the little activi-
ties in which they participate, are
related to religious beliefs.”

In conclusion. Dr. Nash Sugr
gcsted that a college communi-
ty. "working by itself. can also
be termed a 'colony of Heaven' "

the View that mans ability to

about an end to this period of
history.

Dr. Nash declared thut"“tlle
future lies with those who have
eyes to see. It is up to these in—

now. Can we so mold an ew-
rioniic system that we can re-

ed that all previous energy has

but “atomic energy does not de-
pend upon stored-up solar ener-
gy. it represents man's discow

for making energy."

“The atomic bomb reminds us
that every day and every hour
is that much, more precious. We
must make a fundamental de-

chided by saying that “Gail
