Grinnell's Wage Problem - -

Last week, seventy-five students, 60%
of the college working population, petitioned
the all»powerful Personnel Board for a raise
in student wages. Their petition said:

We, the undersigned, hereby petition for
an increase in student wages for the follow-
ingreasons: '

1. The minimum wage in the United States
is 40c an hour.
2. Students at Grinnell are underpaid in
comparison with other colleges.
a. At Municipal university, Omaha, Nebu,
students get 60c an hour.
I). At Chicago university students make
$1 a meal for waiting tables.
c. At Iowa State college, students earn
40-50c an hour.
. Students were assessed $75 a year in
tuition raises because of increased costs.

The students’ needs have increased pro-

portionately. Most of the students who
work do so to meet expenses. Moreover,
most students could not increase their
work without neglecting their studies.

 

Therefore, increased wages seem to be
the only solution.

Today came the answer from the Board.
It said, in part: “We are impressed by the
number of signatures which have been pre-
sented, but might expect such where an in-
crease in wages is concerned.

“We shall be glad to study the matter
further in an effort to determine the proper
action to take. It is our impression, based
on an informal check of other colleges simi-
lar to Grinnell, that Grinnell rates of pay
are not considerably out of line.
of the truth of this statement, we should
wish to make our study principally in re-
lation to the Grinnell situation.”

This indeterminate answer by the Per:
sonnel Board is to some extent off-set by a
statement made by President Stevens, who
said Wednesday: ‘

“I recognize that the students have a
logical claim in view of increased costs. The
problem is budgetary, since this year’s in-
come has already been budgeted in accor-
dance with the old wage scale. I hope and
believe that we can improve conditions next
y'ear."

Dr. Stevens also pointed out that college
costs have gone up 25% in the last year,
with little provision in the budget for such
a rise.

We might point out, however, that, as
the administration doubtless realizes, in-
ﬂation is not confined to the articles that a
college must buy and the salaries of its
maintainance staff. Students, as is stated
in the .petition, also live in all inﬂated econ-
omy, and are forced to pay higher prices.
The vicious spiral, for which no one in-
dividual or group is responsible, catches
everyone in its gyl’ations. The college need
only look at the 25% increase in its cost
to find the approximate amount of increase
with which students are faced.

Grinnell wages are definitely out of line
with other colleges. In this respect, We are
diametrically opposed to the statement of
the Board. But if it wishes to confine its
study to the Grinnell campus, with no re-
gard to the conditions on other campuses,
students will welcome such an investigation.
Wages are still “out of line.”

The irrefutable fact is that in inflation,
ALL FACTORS of expenditure rise. There
is no reason why the student, who admitted-

ly works for a good reason, should bear the
brunt.

Regardless .

College To Set Up
New Sign Board

A new all-college bulletin board
will be installed in the college
bookstore sometime next Week.
The purpose of this board will
be to provide a centrally locat-l
ed spot for postlxlg' importantl
notices and announcements pri-
marily for the benefit of stu-
dents residing in town, as well
as for the convenience of dormi-
mry students.

.Especially designated spaces
will he provided for use by men's
organizations such as the Am
cars and Esglds veterans club,
the Honor G, and the various
men’s halls. Women's organiza-
tions will also be allotted space
for information of important
nature.

Students concerned with lhesc
organizations should make a
practice of checking this bulle-
tin board daily.

To the Editor:

1 should Like in suggest that
orchids are in order for who—
ever is responsible for bringing
Dr. Carl Friedrich to Grinnell a
week ago. He reafﬁrms a lost
faith in Grimell's educational
system. It was indeed a pleas-
ure to sit through a lecture and
then go away mentally stimulat-
ted instead of sleepy.

His lectures fathered more mid-
night “bull" sessions and friend-
ly arguments than have been
heard on this campus in some
ltlme. Whether a person agrees
with his ideas or not is imma-
terial: what does count is that
he gave us a wealth of facls
(all relevant and timely), and
most of all, he made us thinkl
Again I say, Orchids to whoever
is responsible. Id like to shake
his hand.

Dear Editor,

An embryonic sports Writer

must observe certain rules of
health and keep in the best of
physical condition if he is no give
his readers the true sports pic-

ture. Consequently, as head of
the sports section of the so}:
7(total number of sports writer,
one), I have been spending a
great deal of five minutes
Darby gym sweating it out by
watching rather closely the gy-
rations of our powerful basket-
ball team. Further conditioning
activities have included dropping
lsome of my classes including
Elms, (Three) and smoking. (L.
s. M. r. 1‘.)

Last Monday, near the point
of exhaustion after having
watched same team duel-use. I
was about to depart for my n:-
tel-noon nap when I observed
a familiar figul-s jog by me.
This figure, garbed in gym
clothes, was making laps
around the gym at an amazing
speed. Being unablo to plm
in my mind who this could be.
I- made luqull-les of my first
assistant, whistlcthaiho Sphinx,
who took out his book on how

clothes and Ililonned me that
the person In question was
none other than Mr. Joseph w.
Charlton, Associate Professor
of Economics.

Now I have classes under Mr.
Charlton (NOT Elms, three), and
I have seen 'him pick up some
mighty heavy books, but I never
lmagirlsll that he possessed the
power to go running around the
gym at neck-breaking speed.
Perhaps there might be a story
involved that would satisfy some
of the readers that have been
complaining to you that they are
not getting thell- money's worth
out of the sports page. Always
willing to go all out for the dear
readers involved, I tried to stop

kcthalls at him but he merel

Mr. Charlton by throwing bay'

caught them and threw the M”
back, knocking out several of
my teeth. ' .
Here, indeed, was a problem,
Since Mr. Charlton was in no
mood for stopping, there was
only one Lhu'lg to do ~— take the
drastic step of running with him
for an interview, (In journa-
lism, this is known as a running
interview.) Putting my type-
writer under one arm and my
economics book under the other,
I started out. Being unable to
catch the learned professor, I
waited until he caught up with
me. Hidlng my typewriter in the
bags under my eyes and pre-
tending to be buslly engaged in
the study of economics, I feigned
surprise as i heard footsteps be~
hind me. I turned and said,
Mr, Charlton, Exercis-

He replied, “Hello, how
you? Yes, I’m getting a little
wsnn-up. Wouldn't call this ex-
ercise though. Would you?”

“No,” I panted as I fanned
myself with Econ—l. (Ginn 3:

had engaged in some form
sports before. Did you
play in College?”

Smiling broadly and speeding
up the pace s bu, he answered,
