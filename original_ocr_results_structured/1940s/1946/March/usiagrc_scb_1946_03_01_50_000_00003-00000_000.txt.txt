"One World in the Making; Great

phasized that the United Nations
Organization will not be effective
unless there is democratic parti-

ring about world government if

favor of international participa-

§Friedrich Emphasizes the Imp

Dr. Carl J. Friedrich, professor of government at Hnr-
9‘ vard university, this week concluded a series of lectures on
rinternational affairs, with emphasis on the importance of
the United Nations Organization. ‘

The first lecture in the series, reported in last week’s
“Scarlet and Black,” centered on participation by the citia
zens of the United States in the United Nations set-up. Dr.
Friedrich emphasized the need for more direct action by the

posed by the Council for Demo-
cracy, Dr. Friedrich emphasized
four: the limitation of arms-
ments to individual nations, the
control by World government of
atomic energy, the elimination of
veto power, and compulsory juris-
diction of a world court were

cited. The real importance lies
in the first two, said Dr. Fried—
rich.

Dr. Friedrich showed that an
attempt is being made to
change the league into a union.
We cannot have world govern—
ment now because we have no
world community. It‘ is “en-
tirdly conceivable that we may
see a world community develop
within this organization." The
real problem is, am a com—
mnnity develop? it can it .
there is enough common ground
between us and the soviet

- Union.

”The UNO as at present con-
stituted is a league . a league
does not constitute a secure guar-
lantee against war . . . while war
may break out under a league, it
need not." concluding his lec-
ture, Dr. Friedrich said, "Cam we
hope that under the tutelage of
the league, there will grow a
community?" ,
v. s. and U. s. s. R.

The Soviet Union is backing
the UNO heavily because it wants
peace and . protection against
“capitalist encircle‘ment," stated
Carl Friedrich in the third lecture
of the series, entitled "The Soviet
Union, a Democracy or Whati"

Dr. Friedrich stressed the fear
,and apprehension between the
‘United states and the Soviet re-
sulting from the misconceptions
of each as a democracy. If demo—
cracy, is what the United states
is, Russia is not a democracy but
a totalitarian dictatorship. Russia
definesdemocracy on an econo-
mic basis. In order to fully under-
stand existing relationships we
must acknowledge that on one

hand we have Soviet democracy
and on the other capitalist or
constitutional democracy, he ex~

piained.

Dr. Friedrich went on to state
that Russia’s moves may be in-
terpreted in terms or her fear
of “capitalist oncirclement" by
the United States brother capi-
miist nations who possess the
atomic bomb and superior tech-
nology. The Soviet Union, sur-
rounded by possible landing
beaches, moves in a pattern of
intervention to secure friendly
governments in bordering coun-
tries.

We must discuss and compro»
mise our problems with Russia,
Friedrich, as we
do with Great Britain. “Every
American must realize that you
can disagree with a great power
and still live in peace."

Socialism’ vs. Communism I

Discussing “Socialism vs. .Col-n-
munism" in his fourth lecture, Dr.
Friedrich explained the signifi-
cance of the recent British elec-
tion ousting Churchill and placing
the socialistic British Labor party
in power. Although unexpected
in the United states. this so-
cialist victory resulted from El
“general turning away from iinrl
perial tmdltion in the conser-
vative party."

Churchill, "a reactionary among
reectionaries," upheld the con.
servative die-hard policy against
irish and Indian independence.
“In the minds ot the British peo—
ple, Mr. Churchill stood for the
defense of the empire to the last
ditch. This eighteenth century
attitude had little appeal to the
British people," said Dr. Friedrich.

The British swing back to
support of the socialist program
is a direct result or suocaaiui

Soviet resistance to Nazi regres-
sion. Dr. Friedrich said that
British people accepted this as
proot that communism and so—.
cisiism could hold their own
against Nazism.

However, this British trend is
not welcomed by the Soviet Union,
Dr. Friedrich add. “The simila
ity of the viewpoints of the Labor
party and the communists tend
to make them more competitive

tude had been disliked all through
Europe and Asia. Thls way there

policy of playing ‘Iriend of theimsny to become a cause of frac-

penple.' The victory of the Labor
party threatens this position.”
Both France and Italy are now
governed under a socialistrcom-
munist coalition. In both

stances, this torms an uneasy
alliance. ‘Internally and 9:7
ternally the socialists and com-
munists pull in different
rections," said Dr. Friedrich, So-
cialists favor the spreading of
their bcliefs through democratic
means, through the people in each
country coming to socialism them-
selves; while the communists look
to and accept Soviet leadership.

The question immediately
arises as to the tuture of Bri-
min if her empire disappears.
Dr. Friedrich believes that the
colonies are not vital to Eng—
land's existence. "it could be
shown that the empire is more
of a liability than asset." im-
perial losses may be made up
by developing inter-national
trade.

Dr. Friedrich emphasized the
difterence between the common-
wealth and the empire. The
breakdown of the empire would
bring the commonwealth closer
together.

“The British Labor party may
become the bridge between Russia
and the United States—that is its
role in the world today," said
Dr. Friedrich.

Pardtion 01 Germany

“The partition of Germany and
the future of Europe,” was Dr.
Friedrich‘s topic for his firth
lecture.

Dr. Friedrich in commenting on
his lectures as a collective group
said that the discussion of Ger-
many and its partition was de-
pressing ond might prove one of
the more hopeless tasks faced by
the present generation.

The speaker emphasized two
main policies that America should
consider with reference to Ger-
many:

di- ,

l

l

 

tion between the United states
and Russia;

2, “Germany shouldn't be allow
to collapse and drag down the

in» I rest of Europe."

These two long range policies
were stressed throughout.

Placing the partitions oi Ger»
many into four distinct groups,
acoordlng to the nation which
occupies each, the speaker point.
ed out the importance of dis-
tribution and production in
these sectors, and how the con-
trol and quantity of production
mu mean the success or failure
of permanent peace.

The industrial picture in Ger,—
many is divided in the same wnv
that the country is partitioned.
Russia's policy of removing all
methods of producing goods in
their control area means thst
Germany can't produce a su‘[i~
cient amount in that so. r.
America’s policy of playing the
role of reformer is superior
morally to the others but se us
to lack the practical good neces-
sary.

Dr. Friedrich compared these
two conditions with the British
policy, He said that the key to
British policy is to salvage what
can be saved, and this should
prove the most valuable of the
three. Germany, in order to exist,
mu t be able to produce, and the
British apparently will be the
most successrul of nations that
occupy Germany. Britain has
seen the tallacy behind the Pots-
dam Declarations, and the
‘British government realizes that
a war machine turned into peace
time production is the safest way
to keep peace."

In conclusion Dr, Friedrich dd‘
vacated for Amellca's role in
arrairs of Europe, “We must head
our efforts toward working as
far away from the Potsdam De-
clarations as possible, and work
with the British to prepare 1‘8-

1. “We must not allow Ger»‘cunstruction for Europe.
