Marshal Joseph Stalin
Kremlin

Moscow, Russia '
Dear Mr, Stalin:

We are writing to you because we are
afraid that you think that the so—called
leaders of the United States speak for the
U. S. We are writing because we fear that
you think that we value the opinion of
Winston Churchill, the decidedly repudiated
British politician. We write because we
are heart-sick about the sudden and un-
called for turll of international events that
has brought forth a lot of loose talk and
namecalling between our nations. _

As you know, there has long been tenswn
and misunderstanding between our coun—
tries. You have not forgotten United States
intervention in your revolution. We have
not forgotten early Bolshevist ideas about
world upheaval and the overthrow of the
capitalistic system. From these two points,
our relations have stumbled on. We were
bound, however, with steel ties in the war
years, and on this basis of harmony and
understanding that was reached through
necessity, we in the United States hope
that a lasting friendship can be built.

We cringe over the violent statements
made by our own little Jimmy Byrnes in
WashingtonAbut Mr. Stalin, please under—
stand that he has quite a tendency to go
off half-cocked. Mr. Churchill is a bitter
old man, fast losing his place in the world
lime-light, bound by tradition to old im-
perialistic policies, trembling as he watches
the world tulning away from the myth of
Britian‘s dependence upon her possessions.

MUCKLER 8 GEORGE

He would like very much to see the U. S.
defend these possessions. Knowing his be-
liefs, we can understand this, but, Mr.
Stalin, we can‘t see it.

We’re a little worried about some of the
things you’re doing. You won’t let us see
your true hopes and ideas through this
tangled web of charges and counter-charges.
Some of us believe that your strong hand;
in the Balkans, Turkey, and Iran, is being,
exercised because you think that the capi-
talist world has a plot against you. Is that
your fear? Please know, Marshal, that we
know of no such plot, that in Britain and
the U. S., if such a plot existed, it would
need the consent of the people to he put
into effect. We don’t agress on order,
blindly. And we in the U. Stdo not feel that
to have a peaceful world, we must first ex»
terminate all whose economic and social
beliefs are opposed to ours

Our nations are both powerful, full of
resources and potentialities for development
as yet unrealized in the history of the
world. We are both proud and stubborn.
Since Munich, we have been afraid of
appeasement and pacifism. But with the‘
beautiful machinery of the UNO oiled for
productive use, we can see no reason for a
lot of hot talk over phony issues that might
eventually lead our .proud nations into
violence. We hope that we can cease to
discuss the case at long range with every
petty politician in the world putting in his
two-bits worth. Let’s not get excited until
and unless we discover, in a rational dis-
cussion by rational men, that we have real
issues at stake. And if we should discover
this to be true, let’s see what we can dol
about settling it on a sensible give- d-take
basis that will rule out any possi lity of
armed clash.

Yours sincerely,
The Little People

Slack 'em Up - -

While we‘re on the subject of the library,
(as we were last week and will be again)
we would like to discuss the sad stack
situation. The stacks are open only two
hours a day, from 2:304:30. This is duel
to the fact that student assistants cannot
be hired to be on duty in the stacks at ally
other time.

As nearly as we can ascertain, the duties
of the student assistant are to replace hooks
removed from the shelves, and to direct
wandering students from the 330.25‘3 to the
990.75's. If this is the only reason for the
closing of the stacks at all other times, we
would venture that it is a pretty poor rea—
SOIL It takes twice as much time and labor
for students to make out numerous slips
and for a librarian to run back and forth
with books that turn out not to contain the
material that the title seems to indicate, as
it does to let the students find their own
books. We vote for the ullsealing of the
stacks.
