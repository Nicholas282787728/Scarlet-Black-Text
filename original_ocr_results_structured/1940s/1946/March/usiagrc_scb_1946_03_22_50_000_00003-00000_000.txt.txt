Wénsel Gives
Sports Views
To Interviewer

By Rosalie Davis
“‘Life saving and good health

are the primary objectives of phy»
sical education,” said Miss Faye

E. Wensel, Grinnell graduate who‘

is now a physical education in-
structor and Langan hostess. She

has taught physical education for

several years in Wapello and ot-‘

tumwa, before coming to

Grinnell.

“Physical education promotes
good health," she said. “Let's
take swimming for an example.
Swimming, the perfect sport, ex-
ercises all the muscles. President
Roosevelt was an excellent exam—
ple of swimming to maintain
health. The reason there are so
many deaths and accidents in
the water is because of lack of
swimming knowledge. In learn»
ing to swim, you not only over,-
come your fear of water, but you
obtain a great dcal of pleasure
from the sport."

Miss Wensel said that we owe
the excellent status of our physi-
cal education department to Miss
Clara Julia Anderson, who was
head of it until this year. “Nat-
urally, we feel her absence,” Miss
Wensel continued. "She was al-
ways full of good ideas and she
had years of experience behind
her. She is another good exam-
ple of what physical education
can do for a person; for her age,
she has remarkable vitality."

As Miss Wensei curled up com-
fortably on the couch in her
suite, I proceeded to ask her
what she thinks of the Grinnell
faci ties for physical education.

“There are excellent facilities
in Derby gym,” she said, “but it
would be nice if we had permar
nent tennis courts, so tennis play-
ing would not be limited to
spring and fall. We could also
use more equipment in most of
our sports," she added, "and a
dance studio for the dancing
classes."

“Could our physical education
department use any improve-
ments?" I asked.

“Every department can always
use improvements," she said. I'd
like to see physical education put
on the academic program and
have ‘students receive credit for
it is in other subjects, for it is

every bit as important. rd like

evev person at Grinneli to learn
one ir possibly two sports well so
he on play them when he gets
out ate the world. Sports are

a mans of knowing people.

Somtof my finest contacts and
sinceest friends have been made
in th- field of sports,"

"Hrw about a girl majoring in
physical education at Grim-tell?
gs shr qualified to teach when
she giaduates, or does she need
furtha- training?" I asked.

“Sht is fully able to' teach af-
ter the train-ng she receives
here. But no matter how much
train she gets, she must al-
ways be on the lookout for bet-
ter methods of teaching. Most
of all, she definitely should be
an authority on one particular
sport, besides having a good
knowledge of all the others."

I asked her if there were 0th»
or subjects which she thought
had a hearing on the field.

”A physical education major
should know the basic fundament-
als of psychology," she said. “be-
cause such a knowledge is so
important in teaching. She must
use logic and not "go by the
book" all the time. She will
learn individuals more in physical
education than ’ any other

FASHION
FLASHES

By Ann Hellebusch

Wal, dearies, .climb upon aunt—
>le's knee and leave us wander
mentally through the hills and
dales of fashions once again,
Ready?

“The eyes have il . , and for
clothes With “eye appeal" we’d
like to have you note carefully
(on the back of an old blue book)
da following chic numbers:

Alice Power's ice cream-y
white swcatcr (which she made
with her own lettle paws) wit-h
its unusual shoulder and neck
detail; Jackie Bedard's heather
(Heathcliff, where are yuu!)
tweed suit; the new»lea.f green
gabardine dress which Mary Cas-
key sports; and Renny Hauer's
hyacinth blue cashmere sweater.

Also worthy of a second glance
are Max Hay's skin fittin' red
skirt piped in white down the
sides; Mary Lyman‘s good looking
purple suit; the belted, black and
white checked topcoat worn by
"Boole" Bolium; and Ruth Hole
Iden's white ski sweater with the
wild red figures on it. (Wow!)

You won't need specs to notice
Mary Banwell’s oatmeal beige
belted suit with its smart shoula
der tailoring; the pale blue rab-
bit’s hair dress which Elaine
Kayser wears (mit a good belt,
tool); and Betty Montague's
handsome black and white check-
ed suit with the slit skirt. (Men
take note.)

For the latest flash in men's
fashions we highly recommend a
study of Herb “Lover Man"
White's skyblue ski sweater with
the yellow patterns. (Swooning
noises heard here.)

And now ’tis time to close the
cover on our manhole and thumb
quietly through the latest copy
of One Million Dashing Ways to
Wear Feed Sacks.
