degree from Lawrence college.

New Chapel Organ
To Be installed

An Aeolian Skinner organ,
Valued at $40,000, and purchas-
ed with monetary gifts of anon-
ymous donors, will be installed
in Herrick chapel and ready for
use by September of 1947.

“It will be onc or the finest
organs in the middle west,”
President Samuel N. Stevens
stated.

New Dietician Arrives

Miss Virginia Anderson arriv-
ed on the Criiinell campus this
we k to assume duties as a di»
cti inn here. Miss Anderson is
a graduate of Kansas State col-
lege, Manhattan, Kansas.

First nominee in hit the lime-

light was Robert Eaton, town
student, whose campaign manag-
ers posted Eaton signs last week-
‘end. Eaton is manager of Cen-
tral Agency and guard on the
varsity basketball team. With
a strong following to date, Eaa
Lori’s campaign promises via the
campus grapevine, new and sen-
sational developments.
r Maxine Hay, with Student
Council central committee ex<
pei-ience seems to rank among
the strong nominees. Miss Hay
is student producer of the Grin-
nell radio show, and is a mem-
ber of Grinnell Players. The
“Hay Fever" may prove to be
catching.

Read basement sends out two
candidates 7 Ruth Rowland and
Betty Ross though there is
a possibility of the withdrawal
of one in favor of the other.
With both looming large in the
campus political picture, pre-
dictions as to which will run
lwould be dangerous. Miss Ross
,is treasurer of the Student
lCouncll central committee, vice-
‘president of the junior class, and
women's Honor G secretary-tress
urer. Miss Rowland edits the
'1945-46 Cyclone, is on the Scar-
let and Black editorial board,
and was chairman of last fall’s
,Buddies' committee.

John Spencer, Clark prexy, is
a definite threat, with hall sup-
port and a south campus whis<
pering campaign going strong.

Bill Helper-'5 campaign strat—
egy is as yet a mystery, with
little indication Whether or not
he will stay in the race. Ex-
perience as [Cyclone business
manager and junior classvpres—
ident make his Candidacy E de-
:Cidcd possibility. He is also
on the Dibble house council as
sdcial Chairman, and is a mem-
ber of Tanager board.

Another Dibble
Jack Percgoy, is definitely in
the running, Pei-egoy is co-
manager of Gadabouts, and is
Dibble hall treasurer. He is
also on the Grinnell radio staff.
