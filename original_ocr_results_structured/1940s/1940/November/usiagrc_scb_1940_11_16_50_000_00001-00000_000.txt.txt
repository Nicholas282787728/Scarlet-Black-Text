Final Gates Lectures Enumerate Processes In Living
And Suggest Solution For Present World Problems

By Bette Personctt.

“So long as we snuggle, we live,
and so long as we live, We grow;
and would you have it othet~
wise?” asked Dr. Henry Hitt
Crane Wednesday evening in the
fourth talk of the Gates lecture
series delivered in Herrick chapel.

Dr. Crane enumerated the four
fundamental factors in the pro—
cess of living, First, he stated
that all life is growth and that
the essence of the growth process
is struggle. He pointed out that
without struggle there is no
strength, and without strain
there is no success.

Secondly. Dr. Crane said dust
”each man has the ability to
choose between heaven and hell,”
and that wrongdoings are not the
result of heredity or environment.

AS his third point, Dr. Crane
stressed the fact that all of our
lives are interrelated. “As much

as we might want to," he. said,
“we cannot live our own lives."
He stated that what we do and
say inevitably affects the lives of
others. “We are a law-obi ing
universe with certain conditions
bringing forth certain results
from which we cannot get away."
said Dr. crane in making his fi»
nal point. He stated that eventu-
ally we reap what we sow. "The
laws of the kingdom of God,” he
said, "must be fulfilled."

In his fifth lecture, Dr. Crane
said, "God is here, suffering.
searching for us, and ultimately
succeeding in His plans," answer-
ing the question, "What on Earth
IS God Doing?” which was the
topic of this last lecture of the
Gates series, given Thursday
morning in Herrick chapel.

Dr. crane said that sooner or
later any sincere Christian raises
the question of how a good God
could allow the existence of pres-

ent conditions, and wonders what
God is doing. He then discussed
four things that God is doing.

The first point made by Dr.
crane is that God sustains the
moral order of the world. He he-
lieves that this moral order will
result in the rewarding of good
and the punishing of the sin which
we have all been practicing over
a long period of time.

According to the speaker, the
infinite God suffers with the fi-
nite world. He stressed the fact
that we must become aware of
the suffering we can cause God.

Dr. Crane's third point was that
God can act only with the cooper—
ation of men, that His redemptive
power can be set free only
through their acts,

The talk was concluded with
the statement that. in spite of the
sins and ignorance of man, God's
will for the world will be accom-
plished.
