outplayed in every quarter the
Scarlet and Black never so ously
threatened to cross the Beloit
goal, and only stubborn Pionocr
resistance near their own goal
line kept the Blue Devils from
rolling up a higher score.
Punting on Equal Basis.

The first quarter opened with
both teams playing cautious foot-
ball. punting at every opportunr
ity. Keehn, who did the kicking
last night for the Pioneers, and
Griffith of Beloit both averaged
42 yards on their kicks during
the entire game.

Early in the second quarter, Be-
loit pushed the ball from the
Grinnell 45 yard line to the six.
After a series of incomplete
passes by Griffith and May, Grin-
nell took the ball on downs. Dutch
Esgah, Beloit left taclde, recov-
ered a bad pass from center, and
started another Beloit drive to-
ward the Grinnell goal. Grinnell
took the ball on downs on the
two»yard line shortly before the
half ended.

Beloit Scores in Lost Period.

Beloit held the upper hand in
the third quarter. Both tcams
punted consistently, with neither
kicker surpassing the other.

Grinnell opened the final quar-
ter on its 48-yard line, and Keehn,
in long puntfomation, kicked to
the Beloit 15-yard marker. At this
point, Beloit opened an 87-yard
drive which ended in the only
score of the game and victory.
Thomas, hard driving Blue Devil
fullback, plunged through center
from the Pioneer six—yard line to
score. The attempt from place~
ment was blocked.

ing this period. Over a quarter
million persons attended its con-
certs last year.

‘lts policy of introducing new
music and talented soloists was
so conspicuous that it drew the
‘prd‘lse of critics and musicians
throughout the country, Typical
‘of recent critical comment of the
organization is the following by
Edward Barry, music critic for
the Chicago Tribune.

Tribune Critic Says.

“The incredible loveliness of
the string tone and the superb
eloquence of the Illinois Symphony
orchestra's phrasings were two
examples of the kind of thing
which can result from no amount
of calculation and preparation but
must spring directly from a
passionate absorption of the play—
ers in the music at the very
moment of performance.”

football league leaders, each turn-
ed in shutout victories in their
games Friday afternoon. Dibble
closed the season with their ninth
victory, this time at the expense
of Clark, 13 to o.

The Gotcs-Rawson game was
supposed to be a crucial test for
the winners, as Rawson had as
good a. competitive record as any
team in the leagic with the ex:
ception of Dibble,

However, alert playing on the
part of the entire Gates outfit
turned the game into a rout. Don
Scott, alert halfback, started the
fireworks in the first quarter
when he ran 50 yards with an in-
tercepted pass to score. From
then on, the winners tallied in
every period for a decisive win.

Clark put up a surprisingly stiff
battle against Dibble, but the wine
ucrs scored on touchdown passes
to Don Jacobs and Dick Adkins.

It was Dibble’s final game, and
leaves them in the league lead.
