Dr. Hans Kohn Traces Diplomqtic Rise of German Nation
Painting [0 Desire for Conquest Instead of Appeasement

 

It was on Feb. 4, 1938, that theBelgiiim and King Alexander of Chamberlain, who was not trained

German general staff was freed
of the two remaining members
controlled by the old regime, and
from then on the Nazis were in
control of the army and diplom~
atic corps in addition to holding
the economic reins, declared Dr.
Hans Kuhn, guest history lectur-
er, in his seventh lecturc last
night.

Dr. Kuhn's subject was "The
Road to Catastrophe" and dealt
with the diplomatic history of the
past few years.

“No foreign policy with the goal
in view has been so well conduct-
ed as that of the Germans," Dr.
Kohn declared. The Nazis under-
mined the French alliances with
me Slavic states, Riimania, and
Belgium. Also, accidents, includ—
ing the death of King Albert of

Yugoslavia, helped the Germans
considerably. After 1934, only the
French alliance with Czechoslo-
vakia remained.

With the Romelaerlin axis in
1936, France was siirroundetl by
enemies at the outbreak of the
Spanish war. At that time the
Nazis claimed to be haters of
Bolshevism, making pacts with
Japan and Italy against commun—
ism.

“From that time an,” Kohn de-
clared, “Geirnany's policy was to
move forward to world domination
or toward catastrophe.”

Achr Anthony Eden resigned
as Britain's foreign secretary,
Hitler no longer feared England.
IL was Chamberlain's direction of
the British foreign policy that
gave Germany the upper hand.

in foreign affairs, never
have meddled in them,

Dr. Kohn pointed out that Hit»
lcr seems to respect the countries
that dared to show backbone. It
is the countries that try to ap-
pease him that he hates and ap—
presses.

After the Polish conquest, Hitler
could no longer claim to be anti~
Bolshevist because Poland was one
of the greatest anti-Bolshevist
countries in the world.

All this, Dr. Kohn said in con-
clusion, seemed to point to the
fact that Germany was not after
appeasement but conquest, and the
Germans were able to change Eur
tirely their opinion of the Rus-
sians in order to form an alli—
ancc to make further conquest
possible.
