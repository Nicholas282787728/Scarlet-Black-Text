Pioneer Thinclads
At Armour Meet

The sprint medley team that rep—
resented Grinnell at the Armour
Relays at the University of Chi~
cago fieldhouse Saturday night
ran into some bad luck when
Ross Notarc fell in the third leg
of the relay, the second of two
220 yard sprints.

The team was running one of
the three heats in the sprint med-
ley and, until the time at the ac~
cident, was pulling up enough to
win a place in the finish.

Before his tumble .Notorc won
first place in his heat of the
preliminaries in the 70 yard dash

but was nosed out in the semi-l

finals. The men who defeated
Notaro in the semifinal rs
gained first and second places in
the finals.
