Pioneers

to Meet

Coe l—lere Friday

Grinnell Took
Kohawks 47-35
In Earlier Clash

By Jack Wile.
After a disastrous trip into
\Viscollsill last weekend, the
Gl‘lnnell angel‘s will face a re-
juveliitted Coe team ill 21 Mid-
west conference game at
Gl‘ilillell Friday night.

The Pioneers will have to be;
playing in top form if they intend,

to come out on the long and oil '

Friday night’s score, for the new
Kohawk team will come onto the
floor as a much stronger opponent
than it was when Grinnell played
at Cedar Rapids, The Pioneers
won that game, 47 to 35.
Weakness Cited, _

.Coe, because of its loss to Carl-
eton Saturday night, is definitely
out of the running for the champ
ionship but could improve its
chances for second position by de<
feating Grinnell. The main wcak-
ness of the Kobawks appears to
be in their small percentage of
free throws made. Coe and Carl-
eton made 14 field goals apiece in
their game, but the carls made
their charity tosses good.

Grinnell's captain, James Nash,
can be counted upon to lead the
offense. He made a total of 16
points at Lawrence last Saturday
night. We’ll hope that Gene Pei-
sner, center on the Pioneer team,
can keep on finding that hoop and
repeat his score of Saturday
night, which was 10 points.
Lineup Given.

Nash and Kendall will probably
start at forward for the Pioneers,
with Peisner in at center, and
Jerry Fort and Stan Zahller at
the guard positions.

The starting lineup used by the
Kohawks in their last few games
includes Jim Scott and Paul TSch~
irgi at forward, Henry Moss in
the center position, and Don Dun-
lop and Bob Smith taking the
initial guard posts.

New Coach
ls Approved

Consensus Shows
Favorable Reaction
To Douglas Selection

The appointment of Ben Douglas
as new Pioneer football and has-
ketball coach received general ap-
proval both among student leaders
and town people yesterday.

A. L. Frisbie. loo, editor of the
Grinncll Herald-Register. declared,
“I have always thought that the
graduate coaching system was a
good thing for a college like Grin-
nell, always providing that a grad-
uate could be found who was also
a good coach. Benny Douglas
seems to meet the requirements.

“The new set-up, I feel, will
meet with the approval of alumni
generally,”

According to William Pcderscn,
president of the Student Council,
“We approve of the choice of Ben
Douglas as coach at Glilmell and
i am sure that the Student coun-
cil will do everything in its power
to make his new Jul? a success.

“Ave" Adkins, local prognostlc-
ator, declared, ”He’s the only man
for the job."

other Griimell men expressing
approval of the choice of Ben
Douglas include Frank Lynch, '15,
and Russell George, ’16.

Moley is Still
A Democrat
‘Quite Still’

“We should not minimize the ul-
timate advantages that have come
from the New Deal,“ declared
Raymond Moley, fonner close
friend and adviser of President
Roosevelt, in his lecture Monday
night at the congregational
church

Mr. Moley stated that Mr.
Roosevelt was nominated as an
agrarian candidate, and his policy
during the first few years in office
favored the farmer. In 1535,
however, President Roosevelt's
policy shifted from an agricul-
tural policy to an urban or city
policy,

This shift raised Roosevelt's
majority in the city but lowered it
in the rural districts, the Colum-
bia law professor said.

“I was born and raised a Demo-
crat," Mr. Moley continued, “and
am still a Democrat, in fact quite
still."

Mr. Moley declared that there
were two ways to combat politi»
clans, either by becoming more
and more sophisticated or by get-
ting a better class of people in
public representation.

{Ghosls’ to Be New Departure in Drama for Both Actors

A ml A ucll'enc

Presentation Will Emphasize Social Problem

 

By Margaret Curl-ici-

Ibsen's “Ghosts" is the play to be
presented February 29, March 1
and 2, by the Grinnell college de-

partment of drama. It will be a
new departure for both actors and
audience. The play presents dip
forent problems from any given
in Grinncll for some years, and
is one of the most difficult in
thought, characterization. and
movement that has yet been at-
tcmptcd. The theme of the play
is a social problem: “The sins of
the fathers shall be visited on

[the children."

Henrik Ibsen, author of
“Ghosts," wrote ELL it time in the
late nineteenth century when the
world denounced such subjects as
marital infidelity and moral cor-
ruptucss in general as unfit for
stage presentation. Attacked on
all sldes by Victorian pi‘udel‘y and
intellectual stagnation, Ibsen per-
sisted in writing what he cone
ceived to be the truth. NOW, cvel‘
a half Century after his death,
his plays are universally accepts
ed as classics of the theatre, and
they still hold the stage both ill

the United States and abroad.

“Ghosts,” as it is to be pre-
sented soon in Grinncll, will be a
period play dealing with a social
problem which
outdated. The part which deals
with the nineteenth century moral
attitude is only the symbol of the
‘intellcctual torpor and blindness
that is probably the most impor~
taut contributing factor to the
state the world is in today.

In addition to its depth of im—
plication. “Ghusts” is a drama of
powerful emotional appeal and
dramatic value.
