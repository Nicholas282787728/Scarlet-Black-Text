IOWA STATE COLLEGE'S STAR SWIMMERS AND COACH

 

havings

By Jack Wile and Thom Kuhl

Possibly one oi the most out of
place headlines we've,ever seen
appeared in the early editions of
the Wednesday issue of the Chicar
go Daily Tribune saying:
Nollen ls Named
Football Coach at
Grinnell college

r s r x v
A bit of ironicol contrast came
out of yesterday's prep and var—
sity cage battles. The preps, bless
‘eln, won their game from Coe’s
new-horns by a score of 42 to 37.
The varsity lost by a score of 37
to 42. Now, if that could have
been the other way . . .

t a a a it
It's a good thing Ripon‘s rage
team came out on top of Carleton
last night or Grinnell might have
had a pretty tough time keeping
second position alone in the con-
feral-ice , r .

Winner of this week’s "bowler of
the week” title is Ken McGallum,
Gates hall freshman. He rolled a
221 score for high singlegame in
this Week’s intramural matches.
The “team of the week" is still
Dibble, Their total pin score was
1,394.

r a a . e
Jim Nash, captain of the Pioneer
cagers, has broken the allrtime
Grinnell scoring record for one
season, He has looped in 106
field goals and 43 free throws for
a total of 255, which far surpass-
es the record of 231 made by Jim
Slutz back in 1911,

e a i s e ,

Nww the coaolres are demanding

.smaller balls, larger baskets, no
backboards, making the zone do-
fense illegal, doing away with
the four-foul rule, and doing
away with everything else that
makes up the game of basketball.
Maybe the Pioneers would have
won their game last night with
these new rules, but perhaps we
should add the officials just for
the sake of completeness . . .
