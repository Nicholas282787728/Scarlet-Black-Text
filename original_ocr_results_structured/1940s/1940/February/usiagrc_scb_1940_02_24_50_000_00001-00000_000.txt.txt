‘League’ Seen
As Key Group
To World Peace

In his fourth lecture of a series
of eight, Dr. Hans Kohn of Smith
college spoke on the League of
Nations, fascism and democracy.

“We must establish peace for
democracy in this world." Kuhn
stated. “When the League of Na-
tions was first founded, it was
doomed to fail because the people
were not ready for it. The resist-
ance which finally defeated the
League was fascism, according to
the speaker.

“Fascism was hem of two
movements: the weariness of peo—
ple who did not want to think,
and their resistance to the old or-
der of authority,” Dr. Kohn stat-
ed. "Fascism is a revenge which
primitive men take against new
responsibilities. It does not believe
in the possibility or the desirabil-
ity of peace. It is nothing but
the transformation of the old na—
tional life into an army.

"The army must be built
non-democratic principles, on a
principle of blind subordination.
No army can recognize the indiv-
idual right," he continued.

“The true meaning of democrae
cy is a universal movement, a
world-wide movement for peace.
Fascism and democracy cannot
co-exist,” he declared. “In order
to have a League of Nations, we
must have a universal,democracy
and a universal move for peace.
And a League of Nations is nec-
essary to preserve democracy and
to end all war."

National Student Opinion Survey Reveals Undergraduates
Are Opposed to ‘One Year’ Compulsory Military Training

 

AUSTIN, Texas, February 23.
7While the youth of Europe
marches off to the battle fronts,
American college students stand
overwhelmingly opposed even to
the mention of compulsory milie
tary service in the United states.

This is revealed in a coastrtos
coast poll conducted by the lStur
dent Opinion surveys of America,
results of which show that 31 per-
cent of the men and women at-
tending the nation's colleges and
universities are against requiring
“every able-bodied American boy
20 years old to go into the Army
or Navy for one year.”

The poll was

different types of students regis
tered in all the institutions of
higher learning College men, who
would have to Carry the guns and
do the marching, were found to
be the most opposed, only 17 per
cent favoring. But 21 per cent of
the half million girls going to
college said they favored miliv
tary trainingifor the boys.

The national results follow:

Men Women Both

Should require 11% 21% 19%
Should NOT

require 83 '79 31

These figures contrast with
those of a recent poll taken by

taken using a, the Surveys, in which 87 per cent

of the selves for R. 0. T. C. training on

the campus, 4 per cent more men
than women giving their approv—
al, Of those approving, however.
53 per cent specified that it
should be voluntary.

The attitude of campus youth
on Army and NaVy service is con-
gruent with that of the American
public. for in other national polls
opinion has been registered em-
phatically against initiating this
practice now so prevalent abroad.

one explanation of the large
vote students turned in against
compulsory service may be that
a good many believe the United
states can stay out of the pres-
ent war. In a survey last Decem-
ber, as per cent of them were of
that opinion.

Jim Scott, forward on the Coe
five, sank eight field goals and a
free throw to lead the scoring
with a total of 17 points. Henry
Moss, Kohawk center, made only
three field shots, but found the
hoop on 10 out of 11 charity
throws to make him responsible
for 16 of his team‘s points, James
Nash and Hap Kendall made nine
points apiece at forward to lead
the Pioneer scoring attack. Bob
Hamann, who played at center
part of the game, turned in one of
his best games this season.

Grinnell jumped into the lead as
the first half got under way, but
the Kohawks took time out and
came back to tie up the score at
5 to 5 and held the lead from
then on. Bad passing as well as
poor shots kept the Pioneers from
overcoming the leaders. Nash had
accumulated three fouls by the
middle of the first half and was
replaced by Kendall. Repeated
fouling by the Grinnell squad gave
the Coe boys the chance to build
up their lead and, despite Jerry
Fort‘s continued recoveries, pushed
their lead up to 20—11 by the end
