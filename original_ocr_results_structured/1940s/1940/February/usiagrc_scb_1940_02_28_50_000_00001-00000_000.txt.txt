Cage Team
Ends Season

This Weekend

Pioneers Will Meet
Knox and Monmouth

Friday, Saturday Night

Grillnell’s basketball Squad,
after losing to Drake Monday
night by a score of 37 to 40,
will wind up its season this
weekend with a trip into Illi—
llois to play conference games
with Knox at Galesblll‘g on
Friday night and Monmouth
at Monmouth on Saturday
night.

The Knox fivc is at present
floundering in the lower posts of
the conference, having won only
three games in 11 starts this
year. The Pioneers T'orriped over
them when they came to Grin-
nell by a score of 61 to 37. It
was in that game that James
Nash, Pioneer forward, totaled up
26 points to establish a new scor-
ing record at Grinnell.

Knox Lineup Given.

. A definite scoring threat on the
Knox team will be Sam Efno:-,
forwar who has provcn to be
a consistent threat in the maj r
ity of his games this season. Pro-
bable starting lineup for Knox in
Friday night's game will be Velde
and Efnor at forward, Charles at
center and Heerde and Swlse in
the guard posts.

Monmouth, also playing its last
game of the season Saturday
night, is‘ranked as one of the
weaker teams in the conference.
Barely nosing out Lawrence last
Friday night by a score of 54 to
50, the Scots should not prove too
tough for the Pioneers. Bill Sch-
midt, forward, is probably the
only man that will bear watching.

Nazi Germany’s National Socialism Seen as Resurrection

Of Primitive Man by Dr. Hans Ko/m irl Fifth Lecture

 

“National socialism in Germany
is nothing but the resurrection of
primitive man with the progress
of 3,000 years of history denied,"
stated Dr. Hans Kohn, professor
of history at smith college. in
the fifth of thc annual series of
history lectures Tuesday evening.

Dr. Kohn, speaking in Hcrrick
chapel, had as his sublect, “The
New Dynamism,” which included
the historical trends of the origin
of the present German political
philosophy, notional socialism. '

“Unfortunately," Dr. K o h n
mnintnincd, “national socialism is
not a sudden craziness of the Ger-
man peoplc, but it is in its own
way a logical philosophy with
deep roots in German tradition."

It is based upon the denial of
the fundamentals of western po-
litical thought that man can rise
above his nature, and

that all ‘

men are created fundamentally
leqiial, Dr. Kol-in continued. Na-
tional socialism believes that man
remains without change through—
out the centuries and can not
change his inherited nature.
5 “According to thc national so—
ciallsts there can be no equality
of mankind because of their dif-
fercnt blood heritages." hc said.
The philosophy of the Germans
is deeply hopeless because they
deny the kingdom of God, the
Smith professor declared. The ni-
hilistic philosophy of Schopem
hauer, which was one of the
founding German traditions, be-
lieved that life was fundamental-
ly cvil, and that all that re-
maincd was to go out and die. it
has been modified by Frederick
,Nictzscbc, who said that the tragr
ledy of life should be combatcd
by a pessimistic heroism.

“Nazis accept this and believe
that the ultimate in life is on he
roic strugglc even if it leads to
annihilation," Dr. Kohn said. “Nazi
philosophy maintains thattherc
is nothing to life except a vitality
to achieve powerithat there is
no meaning in history and no
progress."

Dr. Kohn argued that German
national socialism is not just a
temporary disease, but a great
revolution, even greater than the
French revolution becaiisc it is a
revolution against everything
that precedes it.

“One of the under-lying causes
of the present world misery is
that our statesmen of the democ-
,l‘acies do not understand that na-
‘tional socialism is a great flame
which devours anything with;
which it comes in contact that
tries to compromise with it,"
