OUR BOTTLE-FED STUDENTS

Ever heard of them? Ever thought about
them? Not overly much, we’ll wager. -’

But why not? They exist. Not only in
other colleges, but right here—here in Grin-
nell, the college of peak educational stan—
dards.

And what are they? They are those
particularly obnoxious sub-species who want
to inhale their education as though out of a
bottleiand with someone to work the nipple
for them!

They are tllose students who consider
their profs mere human phonographs, whose
main obligation to student society is to dis—
seminate only the information necessary to
pass a test in a concise, painless fashion,
interspersed with low comedy and jazzy
comment. They are those bits of collegiate
flotsam and jetsam who would require all inc
structors to use “reason" in their assign-
ments, to make their lectures ”interesting"
and their tests “fair."

In blunter words: they are those jelly—
brained individuals, whose conception of edu«
cation lies in the possession of a 15x20 inch
sheepskin replete with gold seals and spraw—
ling signatures, and whose idea of a college
is a cluster of ivy»covered buildings, a mag-
nificent athletic plant, and at least two
dances every week-end.

And in still stronger language: they are
the students who should have stayed at
home~the students who came to college be-
cause their parents sent them, or because
it‘s the polite thing to do, or because they
have a particular physical aptitude.

They are, in short, a blight upon the face
of genuine education

Yes, and Grinnell college is not immune
to them. Unfortunate, but true

UKINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

What can be done about it? That, frank—
ly, is something of a probleln. It is a prob-
lem reaching far beyond the borders of this
campus, and one which can not be solved so
long ,as the educational institutions of
America labor under the slogan, “Everyone
a college graduate," It is a problem that
can be removed only when it is realized that
every person does not have the capacity to
become really educated. A problem which
can be obliterated only when the schools
accept just those few individuals who Show
signs of that capacity for higher learning
and keep only those persons who continue to
show those signs.

But that's the broad aspect. Now what
can he done about it here in Grinnell?

A more rigid selection, a more rigid dele—
tion, a more rigid program? Perhaps, but
already our standards are far above the
average, and a private college, operating in
a field that has become a highly competitive
business, can not carry standards too far in
present circumstances.

But something can he done: the professors
can refuse to further the view of these
bottle-fed collegialls by rejecting the idea
that only the "test facts” are worth empha-
sis, by removing themselves from their occ»
demlc ruts, and by withdrawing their hom-
age to the great god Examination, as being
all—powerful and important.

Some of them have, and they are to be
congratulated. They have learned that edu»
cation involves something more than lec-
tures and examinations. But some of their
more unfortunate colleagues have not. As
a result, both they and their classes suffer.

And the students? Well, they can con—
sider this editorial preaching if they so
desire. But they can also think about it
twice or evell three timesiand take stock
of themselves and their fellows.

A filial word: “If the shoe fits l . . ”

WE'RE WAITING

One announcement stands out above all the
rest on this week’s college calendar. Under
the heading Monday, February 5, we find,
in large letters, the words SEMESTER
GRADES DUE. The registrar‘s office in-
vited all professors to turn in their grades
last Monday.

But there’s many a slip ’twixt the cup
and lip. Although the question of when
grades were due is easily answered, the
other question of when will the students get
their grades is something else again. F0237
and would you believe itithcre are a few
professors in this college who don’t 'tul‘n
their marks in on time. It’s true. Some ‘of
the instructors who insist that their assiglr
ments be turned in promptly by the students
are a little tardy themselves about meeting
the registrar’s grade deadline. Interesting,
to say the least.

How long should the students have to
wait for their grades" We feel that a week
is a long enough period. As an editorial on
this subject said at mid-semester, “If grades
do have any value at all, they lose much of
it by being reported late. The situation as
it now stands is unsatisfactory, simply be-
cause of the careless attitude of a few people
in key positions." This comment is as apt
now as then. Grades should have been turn—
ed in Monday. The students should get
them during, or immediately after, this
week-end.

We're waiting!
