May 1, 1940 ‘
Dear Ma:

I’m going to be inaugurated into the
Student Council in chapel Friday morning,
and I wisll you could be there to see me.
They say that the chapel is situated be—
tween the library steps and the botany
building, so if you can make it just come
in alld sit anywhere.

Next year, the Student Council is go-
ing to be an extra tough job, because we
have been put on the spot by the new
constitution. I wish I were on the C. of H.
P. because there all a guy has to do is
eat dinner with the dean of men every
Thursday, which isn’t so tough if you have
kept your extracurricular activities secret
for. the preceding six days.

But next year we’re going to have to

you lov ,

fight

The more you ﬁght the more you

break-up.

make decisions, something that is dynamite
and not bellowing the office of a student
leader. This business of having your powA
ers and responsibilities defined is o. k. on
paper, but what is the constituency going
to say if we can’t blame everything on
the League Board, Council of House Presi-
dents, or administration? It’ll come right
back to us, which is awful any Way you
look at it.

Frankly, ma, I‘m worried. I see now
that I was just a bit hasty in wanting the
job; and I guess that all I can do is to
play it cagey, oppose everything, and tell
the boys they mllst have lne confused with
another guy. ,

Pray for me, mil.

Your loving soll,
Willie

o sou-um

When we are not being told that we are
irresponsible, someone is usually informing
us that we take things too seriously. That
is what they tell us when they suspect us
of having an unsavory idea. Now there is
nothing more unwelcome ill a democratic
liberal arts college than all unsavory idea,
as we have suspected for some tilne and as
the recent miniature Dies probe on the
campus has borne out.

Now that the American Legion has
been pacified and the guilty parties taken
to task, we can all join in the chorus ‘of
“Who‘s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?"—
or could if we had any idea of which is
the biggest and baddest. ,The Legion walked
off sniffing and still wondering what it'
was that smelled; the alleged Red Menace
has, we suppose, taken advice to heart and
crawled into its lair to meditate. Hereafter,
apparently, discussions of communism are
to be confined to dormitories; and even then
it is no doubt advisable to be sure the door
is~locked.

The little objectelessoll has seen its con-
clusion. But it will be well to bear in mind
that not all ideas are welcome ill this great
free land of ours, or on our 0an fair green
campus. If you find it necessary to have
an idea, you had better soft-pedal it until
you me sure of its appropriateness. The
Big Bad Wolf has shown that he possesses
a sham nose for car ion, and whether or
not he is really very big and bad, he can
howl, and not too softly.

Stolen - McCune

If you are wondering (which we
doubt) when the spring issue oi
Zephyr, alleged campus humor
magazine, will be issued, he con-
soled by the thought that you
are not the only one faced with
that problem. Late nights find
John McCune. associate editor of
the breeze, gazing into a crystal
ball and wondering the same
thing.

The Esscnbec brings you the
news as it happens and if it hap-
pens. The Esscnhee cannot be
responsible for things that do not
happen. All the Essenbee can do
in this case is to quote McCune.

When queried on the subject,
chCunc feebly answered, “Might
bc thls week, might be next,
might be—(?). Who knows? Cove
ers came off Monday. Ads came
off Tuesday. iLotta white space
in between,”

All indications seem to pointto
the fact that the Zephyr will be
issued . .

.. Editor's note; As usual.

Could be tlint the one man 'we
thought would never fall, Harry
Iiies, after going through two
steadies and playing the field in
thc interims, is in love? A Cana-
iliaii invasion perhaps? '

Large Naval Bill
Upheld as fapanese
Navy Expands

By wnliam o. nan-la.
Although we could scarcely be
classed with the swivelrchair ad~
mii-als in their advocacy oi a
navy-second-tc-none, the latest
dispatches from the nation's cap-
ital are rapidly d olving our
Quaker pi-inclples,

c e a
According to the most startling
figures we have viewed since our
last month's cigarette hill, our
friends the Japanese will shortly
be claiming second place in the
naval rankings of the world. At
present, the slantreyes have but
ten capital ships afloat Lo Uncle
Sam’s ﬁfteen. However, by the
end of 1941, the Nipponesc will
have increased their battleship
ﬂeet to fourteen; while America
wnl be able to boast only one ad-
dition to here.
. t
For, although both nations have
eight ships-ofethe-llne und . con.
struction, Japan, having started
sooner and proceeded taster, will
be able to complete four to our
one by the end of the coming
annum.
.» e s
But these are not
disturbing comparisons po ile.
Including under-age ships and
those in process of building, these
iurthcr contrasts shou‘d liciioted:
Japan has 15 aircraft carriers lo
our seven; 45 cruis to our 43;
137 destroyers to our 97: and so
submarines to our to. And that
in our humble opinion is not a
series of comparisons to aid the
slumbers or our navy»consciolls
administration—nor those of Mr.
Average American, for that mat-
ter.

2 x s

Already, our erstwhile economy-
minded Congress is considering
legislation to remedy this my
crepancy. There is now in conier-
ence a bill providing funds for the
construction or two 45,000 tone
nel‘s, one aircraft carrier, two
Cruisers, eight destroyers, six

subs and five auxlliary vessels.
r r is

But even after this bill passes,
it will be years before these boats
will bc in‘ righting trim. and of
the eight battle—wagons already
in the shipyards only one is to
be completed in 1941; another is
to come off the ways in 1942.
Four more will be delayed until
1943, and the completion of two
45,000 ton manimcths will take
until 1944.

To some tlicse rigures will
prove of little moment, inasmuch
as it is their belief that the con—
trol of the Pacific does notrig’ht-
fully belong to the United states.
In fact, we are of somewhat the
same opinion, feeling that the
dominance of the Far Eastern
watcrs may well be left to the
yellow men. .Even the protection
of our belovedkbut nevertheless
bl)l'dcllsomeiPhllippines does not
concern us. And neither does play-
ing policeman for Queen Wilhel~
niina, our up-snd-coming State

Departmcnt notwithstanding.

At the time, our other closer
interests in the Pacific demand
and will receive our absoluteproc
tection. Hence, we can't bring
ourselves to condemn too strong-
