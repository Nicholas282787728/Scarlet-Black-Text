To THE STUDENT BODY
We wish to acknowledge our ap-
preciation to the Grinnell student
body for their loyal support of
the local dance orchestra and
varsity club. By using a local
dance orchestra, it has been pos-
sible to help the college band pay
in part for the new uniforms pur-
chased last fall.

In spite of the losses sustained
in the gym fire by the student
dance orchestra, it is carrying on.
Your continued support of the
varsitles will he appreciated by
those of us who sponsored the
purchase of the snappy new um-
forms.
