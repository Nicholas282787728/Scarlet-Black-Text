Dr. H. H. Nininger

Tells S’rory of Mefeori’res

heavy, being composed of stony
material fused with metals. and

Mystery Writer
Contributes To
Next Zephyr

By Bette Pcrsouctt.
Who is Charity Casanova?

That is the question the editors
of the “Zephyr" have been ask»
ing ever since this mysterious
writer has contributed several ar-
ticles for the college humor mag—
azine. According to John Mos
Cune, editor, they are all of ex-
cellent caliber.

The first of these contributions
came to the “Zephyr" post office
box with a request that, if the
story was acceptable, an Xshould
be plaoed on a piece of paper on
the book store bulletin hoard.

The action was taken and
three other articles followed.

”‘Zepliyl" was both surprised
and delighted," said McCune,
"and the editors would certainly
like to know the real name of the
contributor. The ellldellce shows
that said contribution is a quadite
or town woman

The next “Zephyr” should come
out Dec. 16 and will be largely
a Christmas issue, according to
McCunc Candid snap-shots will
be featured and names will ap-
pear in over one hundred come
mentai-ies of persons in the col-
loge,

Some of the people who have
contributed to this issue of the
“Zephyr” are: Kenneth Seml,
George Gi-uenwald, James Rus—
sell, Anthony Vraiielt, John MG
Cune. Anne White, Ray Nelson,
Roberta O'Harra, William Gl‘uell»

upon them depends whateversuc-
cess the production may attain,
since the play itself aids so lit-

More specifically, it may he said
that only a superb chal'actelizae
tiou of Mary, the mother of
Jesus, could rescue the play from
the misty nets of mediocrity,

And an amateur actress can
hardly be expected to attain that
necessary excellence 7 especially
when it is far beyond the reach of
myriads of professionals. Thus,

And at times, paiticulorly in the
second and third scenes, her por.
tiayal could only be rated as ex—
cellent, It is indeed unfortunate
that that level was not again at-
tuiued in the concluding act.

fail to attain some success upon

And for the difficult first night
it is fortunate that the Griniicll

could cling to such solid support
as that offered hy the effective

aid the production in rescuing its
