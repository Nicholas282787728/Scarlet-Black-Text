.A Satisfactory Compromise

Thursday there was a petition circulated
among dormitory residents asking the Board
of Trustees to think twice before approw
illg the plans to build tlle new men’s gym—

point. We say this, because it shows that
democracy is not dead at Grinnell.

The gymnasium is to be for the students.
The students were opposed to plans intro-
duced in chapel Wednesday. the trustees
heard the oppo 'tion and stopped to consider
it before ally action was taken

The Scarlet and Black favors this new
plan, for it means tllat MacEachl-oll Field,
one 01' the major assets to the dormitories,
will not be marred by a building jutting
into it. Filtherlnore, we believe that the
$75,000 talked of it ill chapel Wednesday
was insufficieilt to build a satisfactory
gymnasium. The additional $25,000 should
provide the margin of difference.

We congratulate the students who had
the initiative and foresight to instigate the
petition We also thank the Board of Trus-
tees l'or listening to student opinion, alld

To the Editor:
It is my belief that there is Cons
siderable inaccurate knowledge
throughout the campus as to the
profits which the local cleaning
and pressing cstohlishments make.
‘To correct these mistaken as-
sumptions concerning- the profits
or the so-called “cleaning rack-
et," I submit the following stalle-
mcnt of last month’s business
These are actual figures just: us
they appear in my books.

total hours per day

There were 25 working days
last monlh. That makes a total
of 52 hours spent on college gal”
menis. Add to this the hours
spent in making repairs, sewing
on buttons, etc., which is a free
service and the total, according to
the check which I made, arrives
at 56 hours.

The total income from college
business minus the expenditures,
leaves a balance of $20.16. This
sum divided by the number of
hours spent shows an hourly wage
of about 37 cents per hour.

But that is not the entire story.
From this hourly wage must be
deducted overhead such as fuel
for the boiler, insurance, and
rent. And then this same hourly
wage must take care of the hate
ural depreciation in equipment,

As the figures tell the story,
you can see that the profits ouhe
cleaning "racket" are not exorbi—
mit. In comparison with many
other businesses, the net gain is
mod-est enough.

Christmas Songs

The Girls’ Glee club will sing a
group of five Christmas songs at
chapel Tuesday.

The first number will he wTis
the Birthday of the King.” by
Horace Alden Miller, who dedi-
cated it to the Grinnell College
Girls’ Glee club and their direc-
tor, George L. Pierce. The clock
enspiel obligate icr this num-
her will be played by Jane Corr.

The next lrtunher‘ls “The Vir-
gin’s Slumber Song.” by Max
Roger, famous German composer
who worked in Leipzig until his
death a few years ago.

Charming Leieborc arranged the
third song, on old Cornish Christ-
mas Carol, called ”Holy Day
Holly Csrol."

The next selection is from a
group of “Slumber Songs of the
Madonna," by Colin Taylor. Grace
Brant will sing the solo.

llg’ a more satisfactory plan.

More Publicity On—

Gary and Grinnell
—Now It's Winchell

Even Walter Winchell has heard
of Grinncll and Gary Cooper at
this point,

For. in the Wednesday issue oi
the Des Moincs Triuunc, Winchell
says in ‘_‘Tllillgs I Never Knew
Till Now” that:

“There‘s irony in the request
of Grinnell college’s alumni that
Frank Capra should premiere
“Meet John Doe" there. (Fifteen
years ago, Gary Cooper, star of
the Capra flicker, was reJected by
the college's dramatic society)“

Yesiwe know now that Gary
Went to Grinnell, Gary tried out
for the dramatic society, and
Gary failed to make it. (We also
know that Gary failed to show
tor the Junior Prom last year.)

And so we suggest dropping
the subject once and for all. For
we still attend Gary’s pictures,
and we still say proudly, "Yes,
Gary went to Grinneil."
