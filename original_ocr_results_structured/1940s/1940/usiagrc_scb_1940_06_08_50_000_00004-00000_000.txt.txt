O SENIORS YOU ARE WELCOME

“ . . . class of 1925 . . class of 1930 . . .

ity . . . the world awaits your intelligence
and idealism . . . our democracy depends

yours to guide us to spiritual as well as

For decades these phrases have been
drooling from editorial pens at Commencec
ment time. Year by year, college news-
papers have sent the annual crop of seniors
bouncing into tlle arms of a supposedly an—
ticipatory world. And June after June,
commencement orators have added their
blessings to this recurrent burst of plati-
tildes.

And in a great measure these well-wish-
ings were justified. The world did await its
youth. In these last few depressionvdimmed
years it expected them to give a new
freshness, a new hope to a populace dis-
couraged and disheartened by economic col-
lapse. Earlier, in the hey—days of the nine
teen-twenties, it beckoned them to join the
mad, upward scramble for easy riches. And
before that it did not wait for graduation
to bid for the selyices of its college men and
women. It called them from the classroom,
the laboratory, the dormitory and the gym-
nasium. It needed them badly. It needed
them to die for its preservationAor so it
said, at any rate.

And now that day has dawned again.
Already in the blaze of high noon in half
the world, it is casting its growing rays
over America.

Once more, our country is becoming in,
creasingly eager to welcome the occupants
of its schools—eager to welcome them to
serve in her defense. Not just the defense
of her territory, but of her “ideals," her
“way of life," her “fundamental institution."
The clamour for the aid of youth is swelling.
And the cries come from near and far i
from other lands who claim to cherish those
some institutions we hold dear and from
the leaders of our own nation.

G—

And so, class of 1940, you are no differ-
ent from those who have gone before you.

You, too, are welcome in this world. Yes,
even more Welcome than your predecessors
For, you see, they were merely welcome to
make money or to drag society from the
mire of an economic depression or to save
a particular form of government. But you
are welcome to “save civilization" itself.

t Yours is a tl'uly great opportunity, isn’t

0 WHY EDITORS?

(Reprinted from The Upper Iowa Collegian)
We reprint a little editorial which, like many
gems of its peculiar category, crops up here
and there with periodic regularity in print-
ing and journalistic circles This one has the
sly humor its author intended if one reads
on the caption “A Boy’s Essay on Editors."

“I don‘t know how newspapers got into
the world, and I don’t think God does either,
for he ain’t got nothing to say about them
in the Bible. I think the editor is the
missing link we read of, and stayed in the
bushes after the flood,,anfl then came out
and Wrote the thing up, and has been here
ever since. If the editor makes mistakes,
folks say he ought to be hung; but if the
doctor makes mistakes he hurries them and
people don‘t say nothing because they can’t
read and write Latin. When the editor
makes mistakes there is a big law suit, and
swearing and a big fuss, but if a doctor
makes one, there is a funeral, cllt flowers
and perfect silence. A doctor can use a
word a mile long wﬁhout him or anyone
else knowing what it means, but when the
editor-uses one he has to spell it. If the
doctor goes to see another man’s wife, he
charges the man for the visit but if the
editor goes, he gets a charge of buckshot.

“Any college can make doctors to order,
but editors have to be born.”

0 ONE MOMENT, PLEASE, ALUMNI

May we speak with you, frankly and hone
estly, for just a minute or two?

Last fall, Rand gymnasium disappeared
in a burst of smoke and flame. This spring,
forty Grinnell’conscious men students staged
a two-hour entertainment, the proceeds of
which were added to those from previous
effortsinotably the “Fire Bawl”—to stim—
ulate the accumulation of funds for a new
athletic plant. This spring, the partial razing
of the ruins was accomplished at the direcz
tion of the Board of Trustees. And now,
during commencement that board is again
considering the interrelated questions of
Rand gymnasium and new athletic facilities.

That, in brief, is the history of one of
Grinnell college’s largest current problems.

But surely that Chronology is not yet
finished. In commenting upon the destruc-
tion of the campus landmark, the Scarlet and
Black regarded the blackened hulk of the
gymnasium as “more than loss.” More im-
portant was the challenge to the spirit of
Grinnell—the challenge to press on to new
and greater achievements, to replace that
which was destroyed.

That challenge still lingers in the leveled
walls of Rand gymnasium. As yet, it has
been only partially met. But the search
for its answer has begun, fearlessly in the
traditional Grinnell manner.

Administration, faculty, students and
some of your own group have already taken
the first steps, and the march toward the
much-needed improvement in Grinnell's
athletic equipment has become a reality.
But it can not long continue unaided. It
needs your help, badly and soon.

Will you give it?

Grinnell is waiting. She will not be dis
appointed, will she? We think not, and we
thank you, alumni, for this opportunity to
present her plea.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“Don’t go to college expecting to learn how
to make a living. The purpose of college is
to train students’ minds so that they may
intelligently confront any problem. If we
cannot develop citizens with sound character
and sound intelligence, democracy will be a
failure. To develop character and intelli-
gence, colleges should stress mental dis '
pline, simply by means of the three R’s—
reading, writing and ’rithmeticf and they
should pass on to the student the accumlb
lated wisdom of the race.”—University of
Chicago’s Pres. Robelt Maynard Hutchins
summarizes the classicist‘s theory of educa
tion.

Strong Control

Cited as Need for
Defense Program

—By wulian. o. uni-nu.

With Adolph Hitler's crack
mechanized divisions making
bombstudded mincemeat of first-
liue French and English troops,
attention in the Umtcd States has
become riveted upon the growing
national defense problems of this
country.
0 o o

For, with the odds at present
in favor of a quick German
cleanrup in France, American
defense policies are due for a.
blitzkrieg revision. Already, the
nation’s capitol is buzzing with
swivelvchair admirals and army
brass hats, plus a liberal
sprinkling of top-ﬂight induSr
trialists and business leaders,
as Smiling Frank swings his
newlyappoiutcd National De-
fense Board into action.

0 o n

For the past months Congres-
sional military committees have
been ultrahusy gathering static
tics and expert opinion upon the
country’s defense needs. And re-
cently released information is
that the State Department, work-
ing in close conjunction with the
military, is conducting a long
series of secret pow-wows with
the Brazilian authorities looking
forward to the establishment of
United States-dominated military
bases in the South American
country, Although not to be out-
right American possessions, these
new bases, if established, will bc
planned and commanded by offi-
cers of the United States Army
and will be equipped with modern,
American - manufactured imple-
ments of war.

0 a 0
Primary purpose of these bases.
of course, is for added defense
of the vital Panama Canal, key
link in Uncle Sam's outer de-
fense chain.
a a 0
But of strong secondary im-
portallce will be their value
in discouraging any possible
moves upon South American re-
sources by a victorious Ger-
man Reichswellr. And though
such a maneuver by the Nazi
war machine is hardly one that
can be expected in the im—
mediate future, the entirely un-
looked for success of the green-
gray legions against what was
commonly regarded as the finest
army in Europe has made a
south American venture by a
victory-{lushea Hitler more
than a scaremmngcr's dream.
I o 0
With these defense
and especially with the South
American program, News Views
finds itself in heartiest agree
ment, Long maintaining that
force and force alone determines
the principles of international
actioniand not some fairy-talc
world “morality”7we are happy
to see that this nation’s leaders
have at last substituted action
for air. It is high time that that
change becamc effective: modem
war strikes quickly and merciless
1y; there Will be no time to pre-
pare once it has come.

But let us not kid ourselves
that this armament program
can be successfully accomplish-
cd without great changes in our
present social order, If this are
fort’is to be efficient in man»
her and speedy in results,”'we
may as well recognizeizlnd
useithat type of direction

SATURDAY, JUNE 8, 1940

ciency: dictatorship. This, how»
ever, does not mean dictator-
ship a la Hitler, but under war
conditions dictatorship is un-
avoidable. After the crisis has
passed the country would go
back to democracy.
0 o o

This may be an unwelcome
word at present, but the fact re-
mains that the only way to fight
dictatorships is by dictatorship.
Britain and France are discover-
ing that to their bitter cost. And
unless we can profit from their
mistakes, we’ll discover it to Burs.

o o I

Now this doesn’t mean that
We must use that type of direc-
tion in anything except our
armament program at present.
For, as yet, we are confronted
with only a limited national
emergency. But let us have in-
telligence enough to meet that
limited emergency in a prac-
tical, successful manner so that
a total emergency will not
catch us comfortably, hut in-
efficiency cnsonced on our
democratic behindsias were
our dear, but unfortunate
English and French cousins.
