0 “GENTLEMEN” AND DRINKING

Almost any argument can be conceived to
be valid if one first grants to it a false
premise on which it may be maintained. It
is upon such false premise that we believe
the current adverse comment against the
administrative drinking clean-up campaign
is based.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Woven through the argument that the
administrative action was ill-advised is the
contention that college students are women,
men, and above all, GENTLEMEN. As
such, it has been stated, college students
have the inalienable right to Sip, guzzle,
gargle and perhaps drown as gentlemen.
This, we are informed, is the prerogative
of grownvups.

However, the fact remains that by far
the greater majo ity of Grinnell students are
not legally adults. Added to this group is
a considerable proportion of the “adult"
students who have numerous puerile n10'
ments. As a matter of record, the laws
of the state of Iowa prohibit the sale of
beer and other llot»so-tame beverages to
minors. Can there be any good reason for
the administration of Grinllell college to
tolerate the breaking of statute law in order
that students may exercise a non-existent
prerogative and become ”gentlemen?" We
think not.

The administration of Grinnell college
tolerates “gentlemen" for a certain liberal
period of time. When the ”gentlemen” be-
gin to tread upon the interests and objec-
tives of an educational institution they are
warned, and when the warning goes un—
heeded they are excused from their studies
in order that they may retire to their home
town and become “gentlemen.”

A very liberal attitude We contend.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associaied Collegiate Press)

"Some years ago sororities were criticized
for being undemocratic. They were not gove
el'ned and disciplined as they are now. They
now all work together to improve the situa—
tion on all campuses.” Helen Froelich of Nae
tional Park college commends the present
trend of Greek group cooperation.

Spontaneous in action, yet well
formulated in plan, Spring Day
was the finest allecollege affair
we’ve seen. Cottages and halls
pitched in, did their assigned
Work in s cooperative spirit, and
did much-needed constructive
work on campus.

1c was refreshing to see a

thcir texts and dignity, uscumc
human proportion. No doubt.
Spring my did the faculty as
much good as it did the students.
Both muons needed and dc
sewed the change.

The Student Council has long
been the butt of attacks from all
sides. The way in which Spring
Day was organized and conducted
is proof that the Council deserves
more credit than it has ever re-
ceived. Our only regret is that

Of particular note among the
eight ensembles presented by
Madame Palmer Dudovski in c

were: a. shimmering silk ncgllgec.
modeled by Frisbie; street wear
of the adhesive variety, shown by
Matthews and Stanley, andatwo.
piece sport suit of the epidermis

The climax of the entire show
was reached when the last model,
“La." Kaloupek, rcuged, hustled,
bosomed, and bewlgged in the
best "fille dc joie” style, made a
play for a member of the such-
ence, and was restrained only by
force.

The town men's organization
definitely hss added glamor to
this already glamorous institution.

Well, here 1 am again, still
trying to tell you that the
Grinnell stores have “got it" if
you go down and look for it.
How about taking Glenn Mile
lsr cr Benny Goodman on
that picnic tomorrow night?
The Zenith Portable Radios in
George and Hoyt’s would be
swell and they are only $29.95
complete. And while you are
in the store, you can pick up
a steak grill or weenie roast-

you’re really taking some food
along.

In case ybu gals have been
too busy since spring came to
Grim-lei! to reed Vogue and
Harper's, rm telling you that
this year “wedges” are the
thmg, so how ycu csn go to the
Famous Shoe Store and invest
your excess (ha ha) capital in
some footwear. The shoes are
fabric, in colors to match any
dress, and prices range from
$2 50 to 53.50. Naturally, they
must be worn with hose, not
anklets, so you had better pick
up some Mojud stockings on
your way outiwe still have to

snag them in the dining room
an weekends, remember?

.Across the street, Preston‘s
are featuring Palm Beach
slacks in brown and jute (tan,
you guys who don't read Es<
quire) for only 55. The mem-
bers of this college who live
across the tracks are still
wai mg to see the male element
in Grinncll looking nice for at
least one day. Here's ybur
chance!
