Balkan breadbasket will skid to
287,360,000 bushels from a last
year’s total of 445,000,000. Likes

Howcier, on this side of the
Atlantic, the picture is quite re-

Print Rata Charge
Against Dormitories

The plorl‘ala damage levy for the
men‘s dciinitoiics showed a
slight increase for the school
year 1939-40, accoldmg to tig-
ures releascd today by the treas-
lll'el": ottiee,

Clark hill, with an average ot
00 cents per man was tirst, tol-
loueol by Dibble, with 55 cents;
Gates, 45 cents, Smith, Langsn
and Rawson, With 30 cents each,
Carney, 10 cents; and Macy,
none. ,

Last year, Clark'had the most
damage with an average assess-
ment of 82 cents per man.

Reductions in pro rata damage
have been obtained largely
through the adoption of individual
damage forms by the Council ot
House Presidents, which place
the charge against the individual
iather than the men of the ball
as a whole. This form has saved
the men of the dormitories over
$600 in one year, according to
Shelton L, Beatty, dean of men.

Before the adoption of this
term, the pro rota damage in a
single hall had been as high as
$3 90.
