states, Edmund Chester studied
Spanish in his spare time while

ing to Foreign Countries by the
Columbia Broadcasting system.

LatinvAmerican division of the
Associated Press to head CBS'
expanded Latin-American opera~
tions.

tral and South America, for the
Associated Press, Chester has
traveled approximately a quarter-
million miles.

signments was the Chilean earthr

Si'uclen’rs Told

To Convince
Campus of Idea

A rough draft calling for
total revision of the Student
Council was submitted this
morning to Pres. Samuel N.
Stevens, by a group of men
headed by Ray Nelson, Smith
senior.

While not commenting on the

and try to sell the student body
on the revision, Nelson said.
Nelson Tells Plan.

The proposed plan calls for an
entire revision of student govern-
ment, Nelson pointed out. The
student council would be more of
an open forum and would consist
of two representatives from each
of the men's halls, two from each
of the women’s cottages, two
from the town men, and one from
Carney, Macy, Pine Tree, and the
town women, he said.

These representatives could be
any persons in the house with
the exception of the president,
The two men or women receiv-
ing the greatest number of votes
after the nominees had been
reduced to three would be the
representatives, it was stated.
Election Plan Explained.

“Almost every hall and cottage
is divided into two factions and
this plan of voting should insure
both factions having representa-
tivcs on the council," John Mc—
Cune, smith, one of the men
who assisted in drawing up the
