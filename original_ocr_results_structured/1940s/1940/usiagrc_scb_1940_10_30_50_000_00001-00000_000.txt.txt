Rising Bnilding
Costs Impeding

Gym - Stevens

By Hubert James.

"Difficulties have arisen because
of increased building costs which
have to be ironed out before
plans for the new physical edu—
cation center can be completed
and building started," President
Samuel N. Stevens said today.

"The plans must be within our
budget and several plans have
been rejected because of exces-
sive costs and now when one has
been selected, building costs have
risen and again thrown things
up in the air," he added.

There will he a meeting of the
architects this week, so therefore
in two or three weeks there will
be positive evidence of progress,
the newly inaugurated president
said.

“At a meeting of the Board of
Trustees Friday morning,” Presi—
dent Stevens further stated, “we
were encouraged to bring to
fruition the plans which were ap-
proved this summer, if practic-
able." A report was also given on
the progress in development of
plans within the budget at the
meeting:

coming council to carry on with
the parley as has been done in
years past,

Several reasons were listed by

the group, for the abolishmcnt of
the conclave.
