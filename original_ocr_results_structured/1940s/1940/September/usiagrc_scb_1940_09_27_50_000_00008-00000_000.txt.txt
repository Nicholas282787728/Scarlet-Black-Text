In Special Press Conference—

Slevens Clarifies His Al'l'i‘l’ucle

—On Teaching Technical Courses

By Thorn Kuhl and William Buckley.

President Samuel N, Stevens today made clear his attitude
toward teaching technical subjects in a liberal arts college ill
21 special Scarlet and Black conference.

“Griimell is not a university and
it has neither the staff nor the
institutional facilities to do a
complete job of professional or
technical training, Consequently,
courses offered at Gn'nnell in busi.
ness administration. drama. edur
cation and journalism must be re-
cast and fitted into their proper
place in the liberal arts Curri-
culum."

The trend today in such courses
in modern higher education is to
furnish the student with a broad
background of fundamental cul-
tural training in the liberal arts
college and to place the technical
and professional studies at the
graduate level, Stevens said, citing
the wharton School of Finance
and the Harvard School of Busi-
ness Administration as examples.

President Stevens urged every
student to take at least one year
of accounting, for, as he put it. it
‘is a cultural tool and something a
person must have to readily under-
stand the day's news. “I would
like to see stronger accounting

furnish a background for further
professional or technical training
or a broad. cultural education."

The preparation tor journalism
that Gi-innell gives should be Eng-
lish and social sciences, the pre»
paration for business should he
economics, accounting and psyr
chology and the training for teach-
iiig should be the content of what
is to be taught, the new president
claimed. “Then let the students
go into graduate school and spe-
cialize,"

“Gl'innell is too small a college
to do a good job of training. The
state provides colleges for such
purposes," Stevens asserted, “how-
ever, vve can offer the hat in
liberal arts, the best cultural
training, the best background of
any school in the country. And
that is what we intend to do."
