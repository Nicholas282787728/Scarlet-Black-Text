S’revens Calls

To Educal’ion

Claims Grinnell
Will Be Different
In ‘Unknown' Future

Speaking before 800 students and
faculty members Thursday morn
ing at the annual Grinnell college
convocation, President Samuel N.
Stevens pointedly announced that
although the future of Grinnell
college could not be known. he
was certain that it would, in the
future, be different.

The president throughout his
speech emphasized discipline as
an essential factor in establishing
a high standard in education, and
in the moral, spiritual and intel-
lectual life of the individual.
“Discipline," he said, ”is the
mark of an educated man.”

“The purpose of a cultural ede
uoation is to build those kinds of
habits~not those habits that will
make you a good mechanic; not
those habits that will make you
a good technicianebul those
habits that will mold specific
character . . . . we hope to build
up habits of social and spiritual
activity," he stated.

Grinnell's purpose, accordingtc
the president, is to aid men and
women to mold personality. To
achieve success, he pointed out,
it is necessary for the individual
to put forth purpose, selfrdlsc'
pline, mental application. , spi
ual seeking. adaptability, and elas-
ticity.

Among the changes upon which
he touched were approaching re-
tirements among the faculty. He
congratulated the incoming stu-
dents upon thcir good fortune to
he able to absorb some of the
“dignity, prestige and character
of those so soon to leave us.” In
speaking of those members of
the faculty who are soon to re-
tire President Stevens asserted
that some of their ideals and
methods would be employed in
the future to maintain a high
standard in education at ci-innell.

The president was introduced

by Robert' C. Young president of
the student council.

injuries Slow
Grid Prac+ice

By Jack Wilei

With their opening game only
six practices away, the Pioneer
gridders can count on some heavy
workouts these next few days.

Chance for injuries rears its
ugly head as Ben Douglas, Pio-
neer football mentor, shapes his
team to meet Lawrence college
here next Saturday night, On the
injured list at the present time
are Stan Zahller, Marvin Jorgen-
sen, Bob corrigan and John
Kennefick. but some of these fel-
lows should be back on the Squad
by Saturday.

Veterans Missing.

Bob Hamann, who did not re
turn to school this year. will
leave quite a hole in the back
field. Another one of last year's
players that we won’t be seeing
out there this season is Jim
Reynolds, other players who have
dropped from the squad due to
other activities are Bob Young,
Kcnct Pearce, Carlos Kotila and
Don Hippie. .

"lN

 

The Pioneers have shown in
their scrimmages that they mean
business, and there are several
boys out there that will back
that up. We’re speaking mainly
of co»captains Ed Walters and
John Kennefick who can be
counted on to turn in some good
games this fall. Fred Webb will
be the man to Watch in the half-
back position. The laurels go to
Webb as one of the smooﬂmest
running boys that Grinnell has
had for some time.

Carmody calls signals.

Tom Carinody is the man that
will call the signals this year
and he's been doing a good job
of it in the practices. It's a
delayed action combination that
keeps the other boys guessing.
Ca‘i-mody has a pair of glasses
this year that will open a lot
of holes. Walters will take over
the signal~calling when Don Hock
replaces Carmody. .

One thing the boys Will have
this year will be ”class”. They
have {I new huddle that will tickle
the crowd's ego, That, combined
with some of those “Douglas
.Specwl" plays will give us one
terLainment, at least,

From now until Saturday's

game Douglas is planning to keep
his boys in glass casesijust for
Safety’s sake. Be that as it may,
We're going to have some football
in Grinnell this year that will
keep the experts guessing.

Prepping to Be ‘Humanitarian’ This Year As Freshman
Renditions of Three Grinnell Songs

Await Requests for
By Ken Maihewa

Among the many changes about
the campus this year several new
angles are being developed by
the Honor "G” club in the prep»
ping policy,

The lettermcn, under proxy
Edward Stone. have begun to
show some humanitarian tenden—
cies. Several freshmen who have
already been on the carpet have
been given warning tickets with
the admonition not to be called
up again.

First year men will be vocal

this year if nothing else Under
the auspices of the local red-
ooats. all male preps will be re-
quired to be extremely familiar
with three Grinnell songs and all
the college cheers.

The three songs which the first
year men will render at the
slightest provocation are “Sons
of Old Grinnell," “Here Come the
Pioneers,” and "The Spirit of
Grinnell.”

Having a portion of die stu-
dent body know more than the
first verses of the school songs

will be a decided change on cani-
u.
p At football games one spirited
group will be guaranteed. Preps
will sit in a body and are expect—
ed to furnish volume to the
cheers

Two new rules were added to
the prep regulations that Stone
outlined to the men's orientation
class Thursday. Freshmen are
not allowed on the grass while on
the central campus, and
will not be encouraged to sit on
the library steps.
