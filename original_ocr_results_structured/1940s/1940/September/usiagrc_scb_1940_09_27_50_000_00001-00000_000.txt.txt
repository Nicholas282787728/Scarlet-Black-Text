This Season

Quarterback Club
Provides Jobs for
40 Football Men

Sharp Lannom, II, local busi-
ness man, was elected presi-
dent of the newly—organized
Quarterbacks‘ club at its
first regular Monday lunch-
eon. Fiftyeflve members were

present.
Organized This Fall.

The club was organized Sept.
10, 1940. At Lhis meeting 192
people were present. 150 of these
were local merchants interested
in promoting athletics at Grinnell
college.

Since its organization, local
business men have given jobs to
at least All football players.

Hiser Comments.

George Hiser, president of the
Grinnell Chamber of Commerce
and member of the Quarterbacks'
club, said, “The purpose of thc
club is to help football players
at Grinnell with their problems,
and to bring about a better rela-
tionship between Grinnell college
and local businessmen.”

The idea of a Grinnell Quarter-
backs’ club was originally con-
ceived by W. N. Kueneman, busi-
ness manager of the Grinnell
Herald-Register. It has since re-
ceived the support of nearly all of
Grinoell's merchants. Each mer-
chant sponsors one player.

Grinnell Merchants Agree That The Old Pioneer Spirit
Prevails on Campus as Football Season Gets Underway

By Clyde Bates

The “New Deal” has definitely
come to Grinnell, at least so far
as the merchants are concerned.
Fifteen local merchants who were
questioned as to their opinion of
the pioneer spirit this fall, were
practically unanimous in their res
plies that "the old Grinnell spirit"
is back in our midst.

Whatever it was, this subtle
chemistry of "spirit back in the
magic days of ‘Dad' Hoyt, Mor-
gan Taylor, Hank Thomas and
Ben Douglas," is with us again
the merchants maintain.

All who were questioned seem—
ed to feel that Douglas, as coach,
and Stevens, as president, were
responsible for the rejuvenation.

Quotes:
George isor, Monroe Hotel:
"More co—operation between the
college and business men has
developed in the last so days
than in the past seven years.”

Clayton Phelps, haven: “Best
spirit I have seen in twenty
years."

Joe large, urgee' Pharmacy:
“The town is 102 per cent hack of
the Pioneers.”

Stanley “Stub" Preston, Pres-
ton Clothing: “Nothing like this
spin't since 1922."

James H. Beecher, Penney‘s: “l

have never seen as much en-
thusiasm and co-operation be
tween town people, football squad
and the college as l have here

at Grinnell this fall."

w. 3. mm, George and Hoyt:
“The Pioneers have been sick for
a long time. but they seem to
be back on their feet again."

Don Cunningham, Cunningham
Drug: “The spirit this fall is the
best i have ever seen since I
have lived in Grimell‘about
11 years."

Claire Iatchom, Claire's Glenn-
ers: “More town people were at
the night scrimmage than have
been going to games."

Avery Adkins, college barber:
“The spirit of the days of Ben
Douglas is back on the campus."

First Meeting in History.

A pompous ceremony will
accompany Coach Ben Douglas‘
debut as Grinneli's football mentor.
Representing the men's Honor “G”
club in a nag—raising ceremony
will be John Sarbaugh, Robert
Jones and Neuman Fell.

This is the first time in the his
tory of Crinneli football that these
two teams have met on the grids
iron. The Vikings, a Midwest con-
ference team, hail from Appleton,
Wis, and will be out to better
their last year‘s cellar position in
the Conference.

lthtthews Dislocates Finger.

Out of nine teams in the Mid»
west confe nce last year, the
Pioneers f' shed next to the
cellar position, winning two games
and dropping three. However, with
Douglas and his assistant, Oliver
Wagner, behind seven lettermen
and a lot of new material, things
should be different this season.

The only current injury of im<
portance on Lhe sqilad is Ray
Mathews ,who has a dislocated
finger which pushed out through
the skin. However, he is expected
to see a little action in tomorrow
night’s game. Although there are
a few minor ailments here and
there over the squad, none of them
appear to be serious enough to
keep the boys out of the game,
Pioneers Ends lack Speed.

The main weakness on the Pio-
neer eleven seems to be the fact
