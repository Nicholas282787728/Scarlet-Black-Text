Viking Backiield
Appears Strong:
' Center Is Weak

Appleton, Wis.~ (Special to
the Scarlet and Black)—When
the opening whistle sounds in
the Lawrence- Grinnell foote
ball game, it will mark the
first time the Vikings from
Appleton have ever played
football under lights.

To date, the Vikes have worked
out under lights several times to
steel themselves for the coming
battle.
nick linemen.

Coach Bernie Heselton is ham-
pered this year by a lack of line-
men. One of the ends, Herb Kir-
choff, has already been converted
into a tackle. James Benn, a
sophomore, is also looking good at
the same post.

At center, Robert Macintosh
practically stands alone, the other
two pivot men having eliminated,
one by a summer accident and
one by an unusually heavy schole
astic program.
nucldiold Strong.

The backfield is considerably
stronger. Outstanding is the all
around work of Frank Nencki,
who was groomed as a ball car-
rier last year. Another standout
is Frank Hammer, whose goggles
and wearing tactics make him ap-
pear as a wildman out of cork
trol. Two sophomores complete
the backfield. In Bob Osen, the
vikes have a hard driving back of
the contact type. One of the
smallest but firiest of the men is
Dusty Rhodes, who is the real
challenger of the squad.

Coach Heselton considers the
team to be well ahead of their
training schedule, and they should
be in excellent shape for tomor-
row's game.
