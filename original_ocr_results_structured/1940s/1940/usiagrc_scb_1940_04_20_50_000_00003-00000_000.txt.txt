Currier Play-~-

Continued from page 1

mosphere of the play is vulgar
and of a low level. It concerns
drunkards and morons in an un-
pleasant sethng, using obnoxious
language, and I see nothing up-
lifting in it.

High Grinnell standard.

”I believe in the high standard
of education of GrinneII college,
and I don’t believe the standard
should be violated in permitting a
play of this nature to be wit-
nessed by Grinnell students and
faculty." ,

”I have great respect for Miss
Currier's ability, and think that in
time she will develop into a fine
writer if she continues her train-
ing. I don‘t think, however, this
play is representative of her true
ability,” he said.

200 At Meeting.

The play, one of five entered in
competition for the Henry York
Steiner memorial prize, had been
in rehearsal about two weeks, and
the set had been completed at the
time the decision to discontinue
the production was announced.

Miss Currier spoke before a
meeting of about 200 students in
A. R, H. auditorium yesterday
afternoon to clarify her situation
to the student body.

Defend Play.

As stated by Miss Currier, “The
meeting of protest was called up-
on our understanding that the
play had been banned for its
presentation of drinking and be.
fore it had been read. We wanted
to protest such action.

“Also, to defend my play against
charges of vulgarity which the
president of the college had made
against it."

Mrs. Pryor’s comment.

Mrs. Sarah Sherman Pryor, di—
rector of drama said this morning
that “Margaret Currier's play,
‘The Pardoner's Tale,‘ was sug-
gested to her, as the name his

plies, by the old Chaucerian story.
The latter part of the play, which
follows closely the old tale, is ex-
cellently written. The first half
of the play establishes a certain
vulgar realism in situation, char
acter and dialogue that is not
easily dispelled by the more poetic
fantasy of the final scene. The
author no doubt would have
sensed this as rehearsals pro-
gressed and might even have
made important revisions before
the final date of production

"The opportunity of rewriting a
play during the production period.
or afte: its presentation has
showed up weaknesses in the
playrmaking. is the essential help
that experimental production pr0r
rides for the young playwright.
For this reason I am glad that
Giinnell college has offered so
little censorship of student-written
plays. I doubt if any undergradur
ate college has offered Iess, If
the student audience could learn
to observe all college plays with
fewer ill-timed titters and guffaws
and with more intelligent and ma-
ture appreciation of the play’s real
purpose, I doubt if censorship
would ever be considered neces-
sary.

Faith In Miss Currier.

“I have great faith in Margaret
Cul‘rier’s ability as a writer. I
believe that Grinnell college will
be proud of her future achieve
ments, I believe that she can
rewrite ‘The Pardoner's Tale' with
much more credit to herself and
with no offense to any intelligent,
broadminded person,"

Miss Currier. who has gained
recognition as the winner of the
Sclden Whitcomb poetry contest.
the Henry York Steiner essay and
playw-riting contests, the Atlantic
Monthly short story contest, and
has had one one-act play published
by the Dramatic Publishing Com-
pany said, “The play is not es»
sentially vulgar. I think the ques-
tion of the production of a play
should be based on its artistic
merits, and I believe that my play
would stand up under such a test.
Boylen's statement.

“Nothing will stop me from
writing what I feel should be said

. in the way I want to say ILi I

hate to think how the suppression
of this play will affect future
creative work on this campus."

Alfred Boylen, instructor in
drama, commented as follows: “I
feel that banning the play is St]?
ling creative effort in the drama
department of the college. I feel
that it is a fine play, and of pro-
fessional caliber ..

Homer McDowell. graduate stu»
dent, said, “AS a member of the
cast, I regret the abandoning of
so fine a play. Miss Currier iu-

absorbing roles I have ever at-
tempted, and I was having a
wonderful time with it."

William Kaloupek, also an ace
tor iu the play, said, “It seems
unusual that a play should be
suppressed. If plays are going
to be abandoned. I think action
should be taken before rehearsals
have begun."
