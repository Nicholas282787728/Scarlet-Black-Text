O A Revamped Grinnell Spirit

It is rapidly becoming trite to talk about
tlle new spirt which distinguishes all pre
ceding years at Grinnell froln the present
one.

But if the general acceptance 01' the fact
that Grinnell is indeed progressing under
new colors and with a vitally new spirit
has resulted in haclmeyed phrases and ex-
pressions, then so much the worse for trite,
ness.

It is an abiding fact that much of the in»

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

itiative for this change has been taken by
the students themselves. A better football
team, an increased interest in student gov-
ernment, and an improved attitude toward
the policies of the administration are 2: few
examples.

We believe, however, that the hull: of the
credit should go where credit is due—t0 the
administration If the student body exhibits
more intensive interest in Gl'innell and in
the things that are happening here, it is
only because the administration has nur-
tured that interest.

One of the most significant changes, which
had its beginning several years ago and
is now becoming a permanent policy, is that
of the admissions office in distributing at-
tractive booklets to prospective students and
to the public at large.

During the the past few months many imv
provements have been made on the build-
ings and grounds on campus, and plans have
been drawn for the completion of a new field
house, a recreation center and a fine arts
building. Needless to say, these develop-
ments and equipment have evoked much en-
thusiasm from all of us.

Finally and most important, the present ad»
ministration is following a more p ugressive
attitude toward education itse in the
broadest sense. The student body has. had
its attention turned, with the help of an
understanding administration, to the neces—
sity of self-education, of the partaking of
personal responsibill y and of the need for
intelligent self-criticism and self-discipline.
Furthermore, we are all beginning to hear
of some proposed reforms of the curriculum,
of the methods of education, of the cut-
system, and even of the grading system.
Some of these changes are already being
made. The ‘ l‘y fact that these possible
reforms are being discussed so widely
vouches for the essential part they play in
creating the new Grinnell sp .

May Bring Trouble

Unlike U. 5. public opinion, l‘na-
jority sentiment among college
students today holds that if is
more important for the United
States to try to keep out of war
than to help England even at the
risk of becoming involved.

Students were asked by the
Student Opinion Surveys whlch of
the two following things they
thought was more important for
the U. s. to try lo do, Their
answers, in percentages, are given
after each statement!

Keep the U. 5. out of
war 55%
Help England, cvcu at an:
1' k of getting into the
our 45%
This is not what their elders
think. A Gallup poll rcccnlly
poimcd out that the inelority of
Americans believe the British are
holding our first line of dclcnsc
and helping them is more import
ant than merely trying to steer
away from the conflict.

Students, however, have i-cpcal-
edly shown their lcnucucy toward
isolationism and their slrcng dcr
sire to avoid another war, For
two years the survcy hes hccn
gauging collegiate sentiment the
nation over. It has found, for
example, that majorities (in 0cm.
her 1933) would hoe. volunteer
should the U. s. send troops to
help England and her allies, opr
posed (in October 1939) changing
the neutrality law to allow any
belligerent to buy American sup-
plies, opposed (in February 1940)
compulsory military training, and
felt (in February 1940) our most
imporlsnt problem wu to keep
the country out of war.

These opinions have been tem-

pcrcd somewhat by the impact of
recent events such as the tell of

To the Editor
Since the beginning of this school
year, there has been a great
deal said ,about the inefficiency
of the switch board service. It
)5 true, no doubt, that at times,
the service has been slow. Howe
cvcr, little if no consideration
has been given to the campus
lclcphonc facilities.

All collcgc culls go through
the central board which chn be
npcrntcrl by only one pcrson at
n time. If iivc or fifteen re-
ccivcrs are lifted from their re-
spcctivc hooks at once, they must
be taken hr turn. Most of the
collcgc operator are trained by

France, U, s. conscription, and
the spread of the war. An indir
cation of this cooling of opinion
is the large group, ccmprlsmg 45
per cent of the students, who at
this time approve helping Eng
land, even if we eventually have
to fight,

Why does the majority of stur
dents believe that our efforts
should emphasizc our keeping out

The swilch board organization
has been immensely improved
the past two years and is pro-
gressing all of the lune. It canc
not, howcvcr, advance beyond the
physical capacity of the board.
Under ordinary conditions this
size is quite adequate. At rush
tlme, however there is a strain
on the operator as well as the
people trying to make calls,
