George Magoun, First President,
Pleaded for Increased Endowment

By Clyde Bates.

in the historical doucments of
any educational institution there
is one fact which shows up often
or than a third-string halfback in
squad pictures That fact is a
piessing need for more money,
moie buildings and more equip-
melit.

Whether it is for a chapel, a
library or a new field nousc,
Grinnell has always been in the
market for a generous endowment.

in 1865, when Glinnell's first
president, Dr. George F. Magoun
was inaugurated, he made a
blanket plea for endowments to
build a chapel. more rccitation
rooms and a larger library 19w
Grinnellians are more modest in
their demands and will settle for,
a field house,

Dr. Magoun, in a historical
sketch which he wrote at that
time, said, “More recitation rooms
with larger library and cabinet
rooms, and a chapel of twice the
capacity of the present one, are
iniperatively needed, as well as
endowments. A nobler or moie
promising opportunity for far-soc-
ing benevolence could hardly be
opened, and donations for thesc
objecs are urgently requested
from the friends of Christian edus
cation in this and other states "

At the time Dr. Magouii was
writing, in 1865. Iowa college had
been in existence nine years. In
the words of Magoun “The insti-
tution now has about $100,000 of
property of which half is produc-
tive. it has seven instructors, in-
cluding president, four professors,
and principals of the preparatory
and ladies departments. It has
24 gl'aduateseilo from the ladies

than

department this yeal'iand
undergraduates in the four
partments.”
