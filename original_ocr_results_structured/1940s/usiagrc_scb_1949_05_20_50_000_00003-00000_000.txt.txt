MAN SWEARS
By BetterRazorBIade

Plenty of men swear at their
razor blades, but here's a man
who swears by his!

When reporters called on Joe Mul-
doon, they found him Whistling
in the bathroom “Boys," he said,
“just tell my public I'm razor
blade happy. After years of trial
and error, mostly error, I ﬁnally
found my blade — just a ‘feather-
touch’ amino long whiskers! Why,
Shaving with Pal Hollow Ground
is as easy as ﬂicking the top oﬁ’
lemon meringue pie."

Mrl M forgot to say that Pal
Hollow Ground still gives you A
for 10¢ (or 10 for 25¢, 21 for 49¢,
44 for 98¢). He uses Double Edge.
Single Edge cost the same. , 7"
