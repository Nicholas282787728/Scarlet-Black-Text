0 Two or Three Murders

It would seem scarcely necessary to distill-
guish between democracy and anarchy; yet
the events on the Grinnell campus this
week, and the conditions leading up to them,
make it evident that here in recent years
the distinction has too often been ignored.
Not only does a democracy require individ-
ual responsibility; it requires authority first
of all. The term has been used so loosely
that it is foolish to quibble over whether or
not the government of the college is demo-
cratic. We have been accustomed to think-
ing of it as such, when we have thought of
it, which was seldom enough We have ac-
cepted the advantages Grinnell offers,
griped about its restrictions, and as often as
not gone ahead and got away with murder.
By the time we had got away with two or
three murders we began to laugh at the
restrictions. We were comfortable in our
so-called independence of college authority;
yet two years ago the cry went up, ”Is
Grinnell slipping?”

Whatever answer might have been
given to the specific problems to which
the question referred, we have all of us
known that at sometime essentially Grin-
nell had slipped. Except for superficial
manifestations of hysteria and sentimental-
ism, the Grinnell Spirit had become a myth.
The college had grown ﬂabby and spineless;
the student body had ceased to take pride
in itself as an institution. Why? The com-
plete causes, if anyone could say what they
were, would be too many and too complex
to be enumerated. But while the laxity of
the student government bodies of the past
few years has been perhaps first of all a
manifestation of the general irresponsibility,
it has doubled back upon itself and become
a cause as well.

—-————G

This week we have seen one of the most
inescapable evidences of softness forced into
a crisisinot at the instigation, but with the
full sanction and support of the student

, governing bodies. The Scarlet and Black
approves the action both of President Stev-
ens and of the Council of House Presidents

ly the issue; neither is the issue a question
of the fairness to those who have not dis~
obeyed the rules. To base a complaint on
any alleged unfairness seems to us to show
even less responsibility than the offenders
themselves showed. The issue is whether
the action taken is to be merely another,
slightly more yiolent and less decorous
Purge, another laughingstock of a pampered
student body, or whether it is to go down as
a decisive step toward recovering the lost
unity and integrity of Grinnell College.

The Council of House Presidents has
failed to inflict the penalties for drinking in
the dormitories as specified in its constitu-
tion, and has even refused to enforce the
city ordinance against drinking by minors.
Likewise the League Board, after intro-
ducing drinking laws into the constitution of
the Women’s Self-Government League last
year, made threats, but allowed offenders
to go without penalty. With the student
body aware of this situation, they have
taken a step which was not easy, and their
subsequent actions will be even more diffi-
cult. The enforcement of drinking laws is
not just now a matter of personal prejudice;
the future of student government at Grin»
no” is at stake, and the attitude of the en-
tire student body will play a part in de-
ciding that future. Enough murders have
been got away with in the past; now is the
ltime to prevent further atrocities.

. Congratulations, “Mom”

It is with a renewed faith in the common
sense of student government that the Scar-
let. and Black congratulates the Student,
Council on their abondoning of plans for
this year’s ”Brooklyn Conference."

Not only does the Scarlet and Black feel,
as does the Student Council, that there is
no need for the conference this year, but,
as was stated in the editorial “A Student
Leader Scribbles,” which appeared in this
newspaper on Oct. 19, that the conference
has not in the past justified the expendiv
ture of money and effort necessary to its
maintenance,

It is true, as the Student Council indi-
cated in its Open Forum letter of Oct. 30,
that such innovations as the White House,
the centralized student auditing system, and
the present method of financing the Scarlet
and Black were discussed at ,previous
“Brooklyn Conferences.” However, it would
be difficult to establish the Council’s con»
tention that these plans originated at these
conferences. For, the idea of the White
House came from the administration; the
auditing plan was conceived by a former
student auditor who adapted it from that
of another school; and the financial ar—
rangement of this paper was the plan of a
former editor,

And, inasmuch as the "Brooklyn Coll-
ference” has no power to execute recom-
mendations thus brought to it, it merely
discusses them, with no action occuring un-
til those same suggestions are presented to
the proper groups who have the power to
place them in operation. That fact, plus
the tendency of such inane ideas as the one
mentioned in the editorial of Oct. 19 to
monopolize the discussion, leads us to our
thesis that the conferences are a relatively
useless step in the development of new plans
at Grinnell.
