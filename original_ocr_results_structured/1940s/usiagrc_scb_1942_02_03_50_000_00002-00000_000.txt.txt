0 Was Hampton Right?

In theory at least, when Kent Hampton,
speaking for tlle Student Council, refuted all
responsibility for the apprehension of those
directly responsible for the alleged theft of
the Spanish A71 examination, student gov-
ernment fumbled the ball and was tossed
for a ten yard loss.

Ostensibly, Hampton feels, inasmuch as
the faculty has taken over the adminis—
tration of examinations, that this matter,
because it deals with testing, should be
handling by the professors.

On the other hand, this is not a case of
administering a test. It is a case of illegal
breaking and entering, and therefore has
passed out of the hands of the faculty into
the entire Grinnell community

But Hampton has a point. If the Student

Council were to apprehend the culprits, how
much say would the Student Council have
in meting out the punishment. And 1' the
punishment did not satisfy the administra-
tion, would not the administration then
Step in, to deal with the case to their own
satisfaction,

If Grinnellians are ever to have any kind
of an honor system, it is not going to be
forced upon them by the powers of Magoun
hall, nor will it be the product of a Student
Council. It must spring from within the

students themselves

0 Rumors.

We want to make our position clear right
from the beginning. We‘re just normal hu-
man beings, young" and inexperienced pel—
haps, but normal. Some rumors we’ve been
hearing lately have been disturbing us.

Not so long ago we heard that Hitler was
moving into the Rhineland. Then it was
Austria, Czechoslovakia and Norway. But
Europe was far away and we weren’t
alarmed,

Then it was Poland. Britain and France
were there to fill the breech. We weren‘t
disturbed.

Then France crumpled. Rumor had it
that their morale was sllot. No one had the
will to resist. Still, there was an ocean.

Soon it was the draft. Conscription right
here in America in peace-time. W e wondelh
ed about that. Still we were young.

Then it was Japan and the Pearl Harbor
fiasco. We heard that military officials
were to blame. Something about drinking
and parties in the face of imminent danger.
Things were becoming blacker and a little
closer to home.

Just the last few weeks we’ve been hear-
ing rumors right here on the campus—
heavy drinking, secretive night life, tests
disappearing, student morale on the dowlr
grade.

We want to repeat~we’re only human
beings. But we’ve awakened at last. Some-
thing must he done about all this, and soon.

Allegedly. the department found
out about the misdeal in the
examination when, according to
stories circulating about the cam-
pus, cnc Student wrote at the end
of his test that he wished the de-
partment would be more careful
in handling their exams,

Clapp and Roy H. pciring, head
of the department, issued the fol-
lowing Statement yesterday to all

“Since Lllerc is reason to suspect

examinations will also govern
nu. cvcmumion.

“Further comment and
cussion at this time seems
necessary."

Humorous humor.

Following the first wild rumor
that circulated through the dormi-
tories and quadrangle concerning
the rc-cxamluallon next Saturday,
it was said that the Students who
had paid cash for Copies of the
first test were demanding that
their money be returned.

The Student Council planned to
keep their hands clean of the
whole affair. “They (the faculty
and administration) have charge
of handling examinations, so they
can handle this mess,” Kent
Hampton, Council president, said
last night, ‘

In Connection Willi the question
of the Spanish examination, Sam-
llel N, Stevens, president, issued
the following formal statement:

Stovens’ Statement.

“Ninety per cent of the Grinnell
students are honest. They are
men and women of honor, They
conduct themselves in that manner
at all times, in all activities.
They are the ones of whom we are
most proud. We don’t need to
teach them anything about. honor.
They learned from their parents
and homes, from their churches
and high schools,

“We have five per- cent who
have no code of honor. Lying,
cheating and rule breaking is as
uchucl in them as being honest
cud honorable is to the larger
group. They are clicus here.
They are not happy. They are
not growing in wisdom, person-
ullcy or character. They are uu
evil influence, and they cast a
shadow across the student gov-
orment, and 0Vel' the Whole in-
stitutional hfc.

“As fast as we can discov-
er these people we are refus-
ing them the privileges and
opportunities of Grinnell col,
lege.

"There is a final five per cent of
students who are weak. They have
neither honor enough to live like
ladies and gentlemen, nor brains
enough to emulate the strong peo-
ple on the campus. 1v: more easy
and more natural for them to
assoclate with the more evil ele~
mcms, and they do so.

“This group can be helped, And
we shall do all in our power to
help them become strong.

“In referring to the Spanish
exam it is reasonable to suppose
that the originators of the idea of
stealing the examination were not
more than six or eight in number.
It is equally reasonable to suppose
that those weak enough to profit
from their dishonesty were very
likely not more than two or three
times their number.

"A whole class of more than a
hundred will have to be penalized
because of a few who are Wimout
honor. This may be resented but
it is an inevitable experience,
