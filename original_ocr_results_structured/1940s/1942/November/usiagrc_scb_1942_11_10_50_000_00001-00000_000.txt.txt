That the Christian church has unr
, dergone a great change in thought
in the last ﬁfty years was
brought out in Dr. John c. Ben-
nett's opening Gates lecture this
moming in Herrick chapel.
Three notable differences were
cited, the first heing the present
realization of the urgent problem
of dealing with society. Bennett
believes that there has been a
simplification of this prohlem in
that there is now more stress
laid on the ethics and morals of
this world and less on the other
world.

“Christian leaders understand

Living in a moving, fiexihle so-

tempted to regard institutions as
sacred, the speaker emphazized.

“Christian thought," he said,

The theologist concluded by
stressing that great emphasis

church as the church is more
readily Christianizcd than society.

”The church is a community at
its best when the world is at its
worst," he explained.

devoted to practice.

Bauer has had an unusual care
eer in music, Lord commented,
inasmuch as he began work on
the piano at the age of so, after
having attained World—wide repu-
tation as a violinist. He was
strongly influenced by a conver-
sation with Jan Paderewski after
the latter had heard him playing
the piano for his own amusement,
The Polish master told Bauer to
devote himself to that instrument.

Ahandoning his work with the
violin, Bauer followed the advice,
and three years later made his
debut as a pianist in Berlin,
launching a career now studded
with successes. ,

Besides his mastery of the piano
on the concert stage, Bauer has
pioneered in the composing of
new piano selections and the re-
vision of the early works of many
famed composers.
