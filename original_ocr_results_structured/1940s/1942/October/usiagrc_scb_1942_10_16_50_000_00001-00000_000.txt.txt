Howard Lurie, Gates: John Gan-
sert, Rawson; and Alfred Fi'isbie,
town man, were tapped as mem-
bers of Friars, honorary senior
men’s organization, at an extra-

qualities in men on campus dur.

Start Building ‘Open

Loggia To Cowles Dorm
Latest project on the college
building program is the construc-
tion of an open loggia between
Dibble and Cowles dormitory,
Louis v. Phelps, treasurer, an-
nounced yesterday.

Work began this morning, and
the plans call for architectural
construction similar to the pres-
ent loggia connecting all the dor-
mitory houses.

Completion of the new laundry
has been delayed by lack of
equipment, Phelps also said. Four
laundry machines are scheduled to
arrive from Newton this week.

Oldest College

New Herd Book

Classifications
Confuse Campus

The new Grinnell college directory
—“nerd book” to most of Grin-
nelliis out. Copies were distribr
utcd last night in the halls and
cottages by the housemcthers.

New in this year's directory is
the system used for classifying
students. Classes arc now indi-
cated by the numbers one to
eight, students being listed by
semesters instead of by years.

Students looking up their
names to check on spelling, ad—
dresses, classificction, etc, are re
ported surprised by the changce
especially the seniors, who have
jumped from a number ”three”
listing to a number "seven” in
just a few months.

Said one startled senior. “Under
the old system of classification,
this would make me a third—year
graduate student."

And a Grinnell sophomore, look-
ing at the number “three” after
his name, remarked, “Gee! What
happened to my sophomore year?"

Quad residents, however, were
crushed to discover there was ab~
solutely no assistance in locating
and contacting army personnel
given in the campus herd hook.
Thus the directory stands alone
as the one Grinneil object un-
touched by invasion.
