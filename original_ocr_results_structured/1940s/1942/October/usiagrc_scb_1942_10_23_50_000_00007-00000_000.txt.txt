New Olostacle Course Specializes in the

'Tarzan Walk'
One Hazard in
S’reeple-Chase

“Something new has been ad-
ded” to the Grinnell condi—
tioning course this year. The
possibility of erecting am oh-
stacle course on the rough
ground north»of Ward Field
was in the back of the mind of
John c. Triiesdalc, physical edu-
cation head. throughout last
year’s second semester following
the introduction or conditioning
classes last January.

However, not until late this
summer was such a course erect-
ed: Hazards were made from
rough materials, lending a rustic
air to the 528 yard track.

Action on the course varies

high. The track is designed to
develop wind, stamina and al-
most every musclc in a man's
body, says Truesdale.

The victims of the course,—
which means every male student
in college with the exception of
those out for varsity athletics
or specially excused—agree that
it serves its purpose well. Novel-r
theless, tlic men are pleased with
the course because of the large
variety in its barriers which
have promd more enjoyable than
setting up exemlses.

In addition to physical develop
ment each barrier is designed so
that crossing it will teach a
man how to do some thing which
may be or real value to him in
actual warfare.

Conditioning classes cover the
course at least once a week. Runs
ning in pairs the men are tuned
and records of their time are
kept.

John c. Truesdale announced
today that lie was considering
adding a water hound to the
present obstacle course. Such
a hazard, as now plnnned,
would be ten toot wide and
pretty cold.

It would be negotiated, he
siiid, by a leap, and halfway
steps would involve a sudden
change oi temperature for the
jumper.

Although many other schools
have obstacle courses, several
barriers on Grinnell's human
Steeplechase are unique. For in-
stance, there is the “Tarzan”
walk, a. horiztonal ladder nine
feet above the ground.
Rounds'of the ladder are about
three feet apart and a man must
hang by his hands and walk
along the contraption by suc-
cessively grasping the next bar
with one. and then the other
hand. This produces besides mus-

up a log which acts as a ramp.
He then must walk along the

narrow, crooked course for a
