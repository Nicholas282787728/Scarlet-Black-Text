Spring is here.

And added to the more familiar
signs of spring is the sight of
Grinnell coeds, in scanty attire,
gamboling innocently on the
green. The l‘easoniconditioning
classes are now being held out-
doors.

Since Tuesday aiternoon Grin
nell womanhood has exercised on
the hockey field under the in-
terested surveillance of tennis
players, Read residents, stray indi-
viduals and couples, and passing
townspeople.

The appearance of the condi-
tioning classes has .become far
from military. Girls have up
peared in costumes ranging from
regulation gym suits to bathing
suiL5#with everything in between.

This hammerhead is arranging a blind date and
he’s merely telling another meatball that his
“date” won't be any problem because she says

\ Pepsi-Cola is the rage at her school, too. Just as
it is at must schools all over the country.
