0 Convention Time.

Numbered among those honeyed phrases
that enchant the great American public is
“convention time.” Life would be dreary for
the Legionnaire without his annual week
away from the “missus." Republican and
Democratic palties alike would totter over
the brink of oblivion without their frequent
whoopee conventions.

So student government at Glinnell would

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

be lifeless without the spring convention to
be held Saturday afternoon.

Memories of last year’s convention remain
fixed in our minds. A dense cloud of blue
smoke, continual drone of hushed voices. a
brass band leading a Wildly cheering demon-
stration for a strong candidate, banners
waving over the contesting delegations, the
dramatic appeal of a nominating speech, and
everywhere tense students awaiting the un-
expected. Partisan feelings ﬂare up. speak-
ers are heckled. the chairman raps contin~
uously for order. Pandemonium reigns.

The big show is about to begin. Get your
tickets early to avoid the rush. Bring your
stogies and see student government at its
best.

0 Little Grass Shack.

Almost everyone used to have in his imag—
ination plans for running away from the
confusion and conflicts of civilization. by
taking up housekeeping on one of those
peaceful little palm-fringed islands in the
south Pacific.

But where are now the grass skirts of
yesteryear?

Even in our imaginations, the palm trees
and beautiful native girls have taken on a
slightly battered aspect. Even our mental
escapes have been bombed. .

A Miniver Cheevy character would wall
and gnasli his teeth at this point. We will
not. People of courage and fight do not need
fanciful island paradises in order to be
happy.

One mournful tear, however, will be al-
lowed for the beautiful native girls.

Realizing the strain on the col-
lege pocketbook because of rising
costs and campus construction.
several observers. however. feel
that the library should be kept
from further decay.

"It is all we have for the du<
ration of the War. and it should
be made to last.” one observer
said.

Many generations have come
and gone from the library. and
as a result the front steps have
sogged two inches. the flooringof
the lobhy is worn and curling up—
ward. and the floors squeak,
weave and groan underfoot.

Your correspondent saw varied
evidences of a. looking too! over
the stack room, and found that
during a heavy rain it is neces-
sary to put huckcm under certain
Spots which leak.

Among ihcsc evidences were
walls void of plaster, and large
spois too, in fact. spots thatcover
most of the upper north and
south walls. Also in evidence
were cracks in the walls proper,
in addition to smaller spots on
inc walls where paint was peeling
off. obviously recently. as pieces
of it were still on the floor.

In the April 29, 1905 issue of
the Scarlet and Black the library

“The new building is certainly a
thing of beauty. and ought to be
a. joy forever to the many gener-
ations of students that will come

To the Editor:

Where was your story reviewing
the "Faculty Frivols?” The Grin-
nell Herald»Register thought
enough of the program to give it
a page one headline. Your issue
of February 27 carried a, headline
(page one) announcing the skit,
but you sorcly neglected to follow
up.

The administration, the faculty,
the student leaders, and the “I’m

here too's" are constantly coiling
for better family—student relations.
Finally, when the faculty comes
across with in production like the
“Frivols” that can wield stronger
bonds in this omniscussed rela—
tionsllip than can all the hamng.
niug nnd editorializing, I think
the student paper ought to nail
ihcir weatherheaten fedora to the
profs.

Most of us were hmhzcd to find
out that some members of the fac-
Illty were human beings after all.
That fact alone should at least
rate a squib on page two. Per-
sonally. I uiink the consensus
of the student body is that one
and all, they did an excellent job.
Why not be quick to appreciate
as well as to criticize adversely?

From The Nation's Capital

BY ASSOCIATED COLLEGIATE PRESS

..WAR

It is unlikely, according to national Selective Service head-
quarters, that any student in the 20-year-old draft age
group will be called up before June. The lottery isn’t until
March. New draft registrants won’t be completely classified

until sometime in May.

General Hershey's office has cleared up the confusion on how new
lists will be integrated with the old. The answer is, they won’t be.

Not exactly.

Instead the war department will begin an entirely new plan,
about 1, of specifying not only quota numbers but also the
age group from which quotas are to be filled. Thus, if the
army says it would mm 21 to 35, the old list will be used;
if it wants men below 21 or above 35, the new list will be

used.

The latest advice-to collegicns from Selective Service is still, “stick lo
your college work until you’re called." Patriotic fervor has its place,
but a wild rush of volunteers will only serve to complicate planning.

Goods are in for careers, with or without husbands to man-
ag . For “the ultimate” is 9,000,000 niore women workers.

The National Education Associations educational policies commission
(President Conant of Harvard is c member) is recommending a plan
to anticipate Selective Service by two to three yearswatch promising
boys as they leave high school, steer them into fields where they will

be of most use in the war effort.

A ”reserved category" of most promising boys 17 through
1!) would be allocated to schools and colleges for training. The
“reserved category" would be picked “absolutely irrespec-
tive" of financial status of their parents, with Uncle Sam
financing the advanced education.
