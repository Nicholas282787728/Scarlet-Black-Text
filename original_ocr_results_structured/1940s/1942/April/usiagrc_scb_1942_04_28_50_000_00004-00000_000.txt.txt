Navy Makes

Changes in
V-l Program

To Allow Applicants
To Choose Between
Air and Ship Duty

New and important changes
concerning Class V-I, the
Navy’s new training program
for younger college men, were
aniio iiced today by naval au-
tlio es. The new system is do
signed to replace enlistmeuts for
class v-7 which will be closed to
civilians on May 1, Class v-7
trains midshipmen for ensign com-
missions.

Uiider the new program. midr
shipniaii training given under v-7
will be available ciily to men on-
listing in v1 or other enlisted
men in the Navy.

Recent changes in the v-1 sys-
tem allow applicants to chose be-
tween training as aviation ca-
dets or deck or engineering offi-
cers. Those choosing aviation will
become eligible for civilian flight
training during their freshman or
sophomore year. and then take
the v-o course for Naval Air
Force commissions.

Another revision in the plan
makes it possible for a v5 cau-
didote who does not remain in
college for two years or who falls
to pass the V-l classification ex-
amination With a sufﬁciently high
grade to go to one of the Navy's
flight training centers providing
he can pass both the physical
and mental examinations for pros-
pective aviation officers.

Candidates for the v7 classi—
fications who fail to pass the
Navy competitive examination will
be allowed to fluisli their second
calendar year, new equivalent to
approximately three school years
under the new speedup program
of most collge, before they are
assigned to active duty as ap-
prentice seamen.

student applicants for V-l are
enlisted as apprentice seamen in
the Naval Reserve. They are
placed on inactive duty, however,
until their college period of train—
ing is completed. High school
seniors who have been accepted
for admission at accredited col-
leges, or freshmen and sophomores
at such colleges who are not less
than 17 and under 20 years of
age are eligible. -

The standards for the V-l physi-
cal examination will continue to
be the same as those applying to
apprentice seamen. Application
forms can be obtained from deans
at most colleges or at any Navy
Recruiting station.

Interruptions in
Utility Services
To Be Continued

Continuance of interruptions in

electrical service and hot and cold

water at the dormitories was as»

sin-ed today by Paul Meyers, sir .
pcriutcndent of buildings, in a

letter to the Scarlet and Black.

The interruptions are being
caused by the necessity of male
iug connections for these various
services in the new Cowlcs dor-
mitory and the. new gymnasium,
the letter stated. ,

It is possible that they may con—
tinue at infrequent intervals un-
til school is dismissed.

”We will make these interrup-
tions Just as short as possible.
and will endeavor to make them
at a time when we feel it will
be least inconvenient to the stu-
dent body," Meyers asserted.
