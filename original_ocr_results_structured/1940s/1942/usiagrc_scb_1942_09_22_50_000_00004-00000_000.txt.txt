Blue Skies—

Benny Gel-s a \A/orl’yizlird

Coach Ben Douglas aniicuiiced to-
day that he is not wort-ping about
the game with Monmouth Fris
day for says he, “I'm turning all
my worries over to the worry—
bil-d Marty O'Connor sent me.
It’s doing s good job, too; hasn't
lost a pound yet."

The green biological throwback
has taken up residence ,on the
coach's desk, and has spent most
or its time so far this week
worrying about the Pioneer dc-
tense.

For relaxation it polishes its
orange the nails, and wonders
Iorlornly about the lack of speed
shown by this year's team.

Monday the worrybird had a
special treat for dessert, as it
woefully contemplated the pros»
pect of Benny’s getting the flu.
The coach spent the morning in
bed but attended the afternoon
practice, and had an evening ses
sion in the gym with the quartcr-
backs and captain “Curly” Bishop,

Douglas said the ornithological
monstrosity has promised on his
wol‘l‘yblrd's honor, such as it is,
to get around soon to worrying
about Monmouth's fast all-veteran
backfield, its two veteran tackles,
and a veteran end and center.

Douglas told the worrybird that
he thought Monmouth would be
one of the three best teams in
the conference and that it would
take a load off the coach’s mind
if the sadrbeaked fowl would get
around to considering it,

Just in time to supper Monday
night, the bird‘ learned that
Deane Hakes, tackle, had pulled a
ligament in his leg, and although
the bird didn‘t know how serious
this would prove, it got right
to work worrying.

Douglas, relieved of his many
worries, is looking definitely hapv
pier, though he is still suffering
from a cold, and today promised
that the team would be in shape
by this weekend.

He's keeping it a secret from
the cynical bird cage fugitive, but
he thinks that this year's team
is a hit better on is passing
than last year‘s.

The coach was even cheerful
about announcing this Week‘s tens
tative lineup:

Only 11 At Est Fresh
Football Practice

The freshman football team turns
ed out for their first practice
Mondayiall eleven of them, Ben
Douglas, head coach, announced.

Most of the first day's practice
was spent on exercises designed
to get the boys into shape, for
with the prospect of every man
on the squad playing throughout
an entire game, this year’s team
is going to have to be tough.

Only about 15 percent of the
boys in this year's class are out,
compared with last year's squad,
which contained more than 30
percent of the boys in last year’s
freshman class.

Coaching the freshmen is Louie
Gonias, last year's captain and all
conference guard Gonias, assist-
ant coach and trainer, gave up a
profitable Job in Chicago in or
der to come back to the campus
and work with the squad. He is
expecting to be called for army
service sometime in November he
says.

The college has tentatively
scheduled two freshman games,
with Doe and Cornell, to be play-
ed on the samc dates as the var
sity games with those schools,
G. Lester Dukc, director of Ath-
letics, said today.
