Heaven Help Flulher~—-

Baskel‘ball Worries Now

Coach Benny Douglas has begun
to assemble a speedy, individual-
ized tom of hoopsters, who will
meet Iowa State here Dec. 7, in
the dedication game of the now
gym. anie Vanstrum and Har-
ry Waters are still impaired by
football injuries. Another letter-
r’nan of last season, Tod Kenne-
fick, has also not reported yet.
'l'wo new men on the squad are

Hal Robison and Lefty Sory.
Robison, a center, will aid Joe
Dykstra and Harry Waters in
ﬂat position, Another possible
hole in the squad will be assigned
to Fluther's Shoulders if Jack
McGrane leaves school at the end
of the semester.

A prep team, coached by Duke,
has begun practice. Any potential
mshman players should see Duke
this week, if they would like to
play, Duke said.

For the next ten days Douglas
will drill the squad in the funda~
mentals, shooting, faking and
cutting. He plans to change the
offensive strategy of the quintet
to an individual attack based on
fast breaking. The speed of his
players makes this type of attack
effective.

Kennefick Plays Mast

To win a letter in footbau a
player must be credited with
thirty per cent of the total play—
ing time which was 420 minutes
this year. 403 minutes were cred<
itcd to Tod ideniiefick, 398 to lEv
Mitchell; and John Miller, win—
ning his first letter, played the
third lengthiest period, 355 min—
utes. Eight iron men were in the

game at least three—fourths of
the time,

Prep Hopes Wifh l3-0

The eagle soared on high Thurs—
day, as Dibble’s football team
clinched the intramural gridiron
trophy by pounding out a 14—7
win over Smith.

Dibble went into the lead mid-
way in the second quarter when
Grover Milliken intercepted a
Smith pass and went 45 yards to
score. Hal Robinson passed to
Elle for the extra point.

Dibble scored again in the third
period when Robinson skirted his
own left end, and rambled so
yards to a touchdown. Robinson

Five To Run in

Ames Tomorrow

Five varsity cl'ossrcountl'y run-
ners from Grihnell will meet Se -
hawk greats, and Drake and I0-
wa state on the hilly Ames
course tomorrow. Matlack, Mari-
key, Voorhes, Mccurdy, and Allis
son will make the trip.

Each of these teams has out—
run Crinncll decisively in earlier
meets this season, and the Plan-

eer runners' task will be made
still harder by the ruggedness of
the course,

Last week seven Bulldog strid—
ers defeated a nine-man Grinnell
squad 56-15, Matlack and Man-
key. first for Grinnell, placed
seventh and eighth; Voorhes, Mc-
Curdy, and Allison finished tenth,
eleventh. and twelfth, respective-
ly. Freshmen Bill Smith, Fred
Currier, and Noble Taylor ran for
practice, but their times did not
affect the score.

Grid Ti’rle

again passed for the extra point.
Smith's tally came late in the
final quarter when Findley passed
to Patterson in the end zone.
Findleys kick was good.

Dibblt>South tread

Dibble had been unable to main-
tain its perfect defensive record
Tuesday. but it decisively beat
South Read, which was hitherto
its greatest threat in.the intra-
mural football race.

The score was 14-6. 1n the first
quarter Dibble drove to the one
foot line but‘ were held. In the
second period, however, Robinson
pitched a 20 yd. pass over center
to Milliken for the first touch-

down.

Crandall threw him a pass for an
easy touchdown,

Clark-South Read

South Read, downhearted after
their setback on the previous
night, succumbed to Clark 13-0
Wednesday. In the second quarter
Ed Krause tossed Brody a long
pass for the first Clark score. The
final score was made when Bob
Crandall of Clark fumbled on his
own goal line. Brody and Krause
played good hall for Clark.

Lawrence Show Promise;

Frilz’s Loss Clips Squad

Grinnell's natators, vvith little
chance of repeating last year’s
excellent record of five victories
and one defeat, will get back in
the swim Tuesday when they op—
en their practice sessions.

With only two men reporting
out of the 1942 teams regular
squad oi ten, swimming hopes
must be placed on relatively in-
oxperlenwd men.

The fact that Collin Fritz, let-
terman breaststroker will be out
for the season with a broken leg
suffered while playing intramural
football, has set the Pioneer
splashers back considerably.

However, Grinneu has prospec-
tive point-getters in sophomore
Gib Bresnahan, hackstroker; Bill
Findley, who won his letter the
breaststroke last year, and Dick
Lawrence, freestyler.

Athletic director G, Lester Duke
has been drafted to fill the ooaoka
tug vacancy made last year when
Marty O'Connor enlisted as a
physical instructor in the air
corps.

According to Duke, transporter
tion problems will curtail most
of the long trips which have been
common in the past, and be stat-
ed that the majority of the meets
will have to be telegraphic,
