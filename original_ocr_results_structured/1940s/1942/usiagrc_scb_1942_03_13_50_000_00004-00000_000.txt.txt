Although no successor has been
picloed to take over Marty on
Connor's position as tcnnis coach,
members ot the team are working
out daily with the track squad,
G. Lester Duke, director of inter.
collegiate athletics, said today.

As soon as the ground drics,
he pointed out, the team will
move outside to the tennis courts.

Duke said he was meeting with
difficulty scheduling matches be-
cause many schools have cancel-
led tennis tor the duration of the
war,

However with sterling Lord
and Ralph Hart forming the
neucleus for one of the strongest
team in Grinnell's history, it is
unlikely that the Pioneer's will

it broke over a million years ago.

He thinks that it came from the
north shore of Lake Superior, but
will not know for sure without
additional study of geological
maps and other data. From the
study of this and other specimens,
Canard will be able to detenninc
the direction of the glacial sheet.

Dr. Conard found the stone in
the bottom or a limestone quarry
in Locrsnd, Iowa, and the only

‘ cost involved was in transporting

the stone from there to the cam-
pus.

The only other case similar to
this in connection with Grinnell
happened some years ago, when a
farmer outside of town ploughed
up a copper nugget weighing over
70 pounds. Through this and
other specimens, the path of the
glacier was traced to the North
shores of Lake Superior,

Bob Corrigan Will run in both
the 70 yard high and low hurdles

been only 50 yards long while
standard outdoor hurdles are 120
yards long.
