FROM STUDENTS TO SOLDIERS

Z 209
VOLUME XLIX

It has been six weeks since the stu-
dents and faculty of Grinnell college
learned that this school was to quar-
ter 750 officer training candidates
this year. -

In that time we’ve done some re<
arranging—moving out of the dorms,
turning offices into class rooms and
homes into offices, learning to eat in
shifts.

Perhaps to you, arriving only to-
day, we seem scarcely organized.
You‘re right. We’re still excavating
the “Y" building basement; we still
lose classes occasionally. We still
look at the White House with some»
thing of nostalgia.

But our feeling at your coming is
not all confusion or homesickness for
this school as we have always known
it. In seriousness and sincerity we

can say that we have looked forward
to your coming, that we are glad
you are now here.

That feeling is neither pure pa,
triotism lior war—time emotionalism.
There are more serious things to be
considered in this, the first disrup-
tion of our academic pattern since
1917.

We have, first, a sense of pride,
not only because Grinnell has been
chosen as the headquarters for this
training school, but because we have
been able, in six weeks, to adjust
ourselves in a measure to a new way
of living in Grinnell. The old buga—
boo of “academic complacency" has
been beaten. We have faced changes,
and have determined not to lose
Sight of any of the real values of an
institution like Grinnell. The oppor-

tunity to test ourselves and our de-
gree of maturity we owe to you.

Secondly, we have a sincere feel-
ing- of good-will toward you of the
army post. You are the first group
ever to enter the life of Grinnell col—
lege without being members of its
academic organization That is only
one of the many unique aspects of
a military post stationed on a liberal
arts college campus. But if you are
to be only on this campus and not
of it, the hopes we hold for a sig-
nificant and purposeful year can nev-
er be realized.

You are preparing yourselves for
the most serious job Americans
have had to do. We are preparing
for the same job. Many of our Glin-
nell men will be in your ranks by
next spring. The rest of us may be

carrying out in other ways, work for
the same purpose We have, there-
tore, a common purpose to be re-
alized this year.

On the basis of that purpose, we,
the students of Grinnell college, have
a bond of association and friendship
With you. We want you to feel as
much a part of this college ’as your
duties will permit. In other days we
might have met you as students
here. Now our campus is changed;
the spirit of all colleges is changed.
But the warmth of welcome which
it has been traditional to extend to
all new Grinnellians is, and shall be,
the same.

To you we dedicate this issue in
the hope that it will acquaint you
with this school and with us. And to
you we extend welcome.

Juniors Give
l00% Support
For Cyilone

Vote Not to Disband
Grinnell Year Book
Despite Difficulties

With a personal pledge by and:
member of the class to buy s copy
of the 1943 Cyclone, the juniors
Monday night voted to print “as
good a. book as ever," according
to Lyle Krause, business manager
of the annual.

Meeting in the Little Theater,
the class heard Krause tell of diffi-
culties in financing the publication
this year. Decreased college en-
rollment and shortages of copper
for engraving are giving the Cy-
clone Staff “a tough job," Kmusc
seid.

putting the question of can-
ccllstion of the Cyclons up to the
class, Kmuse said the job would
be impossible without the active
support or all juniors.

Annual budget tor the publica-
tion is 32700, which requires is sub»
scriptiou list of at lcsst 450.

After voting to put out a. book
of good quality, with no change in
paper or makesup unless sbsolutc—
ly necessary, the 'class members
present pledged individual pur-
chase of the annual.

With leather for covm now un-
obtsinublc, Ann Crews, editor,
said that n mesh-typo cloth com
would probably be med and thht
smoli changes in make-up could
be unite to lower cant i: neeullry.

Official welcome to the
campus will be given by Pres.
Samuel N. Stevens at the as-
sembly.

The school established on cam«
pus is one. of a new type of army
sdministrative schools being in<
stituted throughout the country,
Hammond ssid.

“W6 are almost a ‘test 636’
and the settling up of similar
schools wlu depend upon the suc-
oess of the few now functioning.

“Indicstions are for s very suc—
cessful year here. If I could
have choscn the site for this of—
ficer candidate school, 1 would
hsvc chosen is liberal arts school
like this in every respect.

‘The officers il'nd men already
here like the campus very much.
You have had to go through a
great deal of rearranging to sea
comodsts the post, sud you have
been ready to welcome us when
we arrived. We all appreciate
you cooperative spirit deeply."

Meanwhile, personnel of the
school will be complet on Sutuz~
day, with 250 candidates snd 62
orncecs and enlisted men here
for the first. unit’s trsining.

Ranging in age from 18 to 46,
the candidates represent all Sena
lions of the country with men
reporting from Ft. Lewis Wash;
Pine Comp, N. 1.; and Florida.
according to Capt. Ernest H.
Reed. who released schedules of
courses snd activities last night.
