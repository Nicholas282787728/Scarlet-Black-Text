For First Win in 15 Years

Leads AHack In
Second Half Rally

Grinnell opened its basketball
season with a bang here Monday
by defeating Iowa state, 37-30.
Playing their first game in the
new gym and under a new coach,
the Pioneers whipped the Cyclones
soundly for their first basketball

win over Iowa state in fifteen

years.

The start of the game was mar—
red by many fouls, as Grinnell
jumped into a 4—1 lead mostly
through the offensive efforts of
“Tex” Kaufmann. The cyclones,
however, soon tied it up, and
the lead see-sowed until the half-
time when die score was 15—13 in
Iowa State's favor.

After Iowa State increased its
lead to four points at the begin—
ning of the second half, Grlnllell
begin to click MoGrane who had
not scored during the first half,
slipped in two baskets and a free
throw, and Kanfmann put in two
'baskets before the Cyclones were
able to score again. They snapped
out of their slump, though, with
niree baskets to tie the game up.
Tiien Bowers matched an addi-
tional Iowa state goal before
Harry Waters put Grinnell into
the lead for good.

At this point Jack McGrane,
who didn’t play much last year
personally took command of
Grinnelrs scoring by tallying nine

Cornell quintet here tomol‘e

which split even with Grinnell
in their two games last season.

tarnishel record when they take

lNTRAMURALS 1

Smith overpowered Dibble last
night to move into a first place
tie with Clark, completing the
formal volleyball schedule. Dibble,
playing good ball held smith to
a three-point win in the first
game. The second game was de
eidcdly more one-sided with the
smith boys walking away with
an 114] victory.

The game failed to decide the
volley-ball championship however,
leaving Smith and Clark at the
top with six games and one loss
apiece. The tie necessitates a
play-off which Will probably take
place next week

The Town men captured third
place Saturday afternoon with a
victory over Rawson. Needing

only two games to win, the Town
team romped over Rawson, 1575,
and 1578.

North Read moved into a three
way tie for fourth place by dc—
feating Dibble, 1575, and 15-13. A
much improved team from the
seasons experience the preps turlie
ed in their best performance of
the year, sharing fourth place
with them are Gates and Rawson,
with three Wins and four lusses
each,

Dibble's late season losing
streak landed them’ in seventh
place just ahead of South Read,
Dibble has two Wins and five
losses on the record while South
Read ended the Season with six
losses and one victory.

Drake Has 34-33 Edge
In Traditional Series;
Banks On Prep Cagers

Grinnell‘ clashes with its peren-
nial basketball foe, Drake, here

Monday. In its first game of the
season the Bulldogs whipped
Simpson 42-27.

Monday the Pioneers wiu be
striving to even up a basketball
series which goes back to 1901.
Gi'lnnell to date has won 33
games while Drake is one up
with a record of 3-1 Victories.

Although Griniiell will be given
at least an even chance of win-
ning accordingto previous pelt
formances, Grinnell-Drake games
are traditionally hard tusslcs
with pre-game dope often going
wrong. McGi-ane and Kaufmann
at forwards, Waters at center,
and Bowers and Kennefick at
guards will start according to
Coach Lester Duke.

Drake, taking advantage of the
Missouri Valley conference fresh-
man rule, is using three fresh-
men in its starting lineup. Two
of these won all-state positions
last year. Dirksen, Drake’s start-
ing center from Freeport, Illinois.

Won a place on the Illinois all~
state team last year. Bill Evans,
regular guard, won a ,position
On the Iowa, allistate team last
year while playing for Nevada
High. Ollrlch at: forward is the
other .starting freshman. The
team is filled out with Scott and
Naylor both sophomores at for-
ward and guard respectively

gym was erected, the college used
the basement of the present music
building for men's physical educa—
tion.
