O A PARABLE.

ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A
PRESIDENT OF A COLLEGE WHO IN
HIS YOUTH HAD LEARNED THE TRUE
VALUE OF EXERCISE, THENCE, WHEN
FLAG AND COUNTRY CALLED, HE WAS
WELL AWARE JUST WHAT BEST
WOULD BENEFIT THE STUDENTS WHO
RELIED UPON HIM FOR COMFORT
AND GUIDANCE,

EACH WAS COMPELLED TO TAKE
PART IN A CONDITIONING PROGRAM
OF GREAT MAGNITUDE, WITH THE
PROMISE THAT SOMEDAY THE PRESI-
DENT WOULD JOIN THEIR 'EIGHT
O’CLOCK CLASS AND EXERCISE
ALONGSIDE EVEN THE LOWLIEST
PREP. HE PREVAILED UPON THE
STUDENTS IN THIS \VAY,‘AND ALL
DID THEIR BEST TO FOLLOW HIS AD-
VICE,

EVEN MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY
LEFT THEIR DUSTY LIBRARIES AND
JOURNEYED FORTH TO THE GYM TO
PLAY AT VOLLEYBALL. ONE SUCH
MEMBER RAN ROUND AND ROUND
THE INDOOR TRACK EACH DAY, RE-

AND THEN THE STUDENTS BE—
GAN TO LOSE FAITH. FACULTY HAD
TURNED OUT IN ABUNDANCE, BUT
THEIR PRESIDENT HAD NOT FOUND
TIME TO ATTEND A CONDITIONING
CLASS. HE WAS T00 BUSY AND IT
SLIPPED HIS MIND.

STUDENTS BEGAN TO MUTTER AND
WHISPER TOGETHER. WHAT COULD
BE THE MATTERC7 ONE OF THE WISER
STUDENTS CONCEIVED A BRILLIANT
PLANI WHY NOT SUBTLY REMIND THE
PRESIDENT OF HIS PROMISE? AN EDIV

TORIAL WAS SUBSEQUENTLY WRIT-
TEN BY THE STUDENT, AND THE
PRESIDENT’S SECRETARY, BROWSING
THROUGH THE COLLEGE NEWSPAPER,
CAME UPON THE PLEA AND REMIND»
ED HER BOSS OF HIS PROMISE.

HE WAS FILLED WITH REMORSE,
AND NEXT DAY, BRIGHT AND EARLY,
THE STUDENTS WERE OVERJOYED TO
SEE THEIR BELOVED PRESIDENT JOG-
GING ABOUT THE TRACK IN WHITE

0 End of the One Horse?

The war has been upon us now for five
months and inlall that time some pressing
problems have been raised. But no more
vital question has come before the Ameri—
can people than the one which asks, “What
is to become of the small business man?"

People are not traveling anymore. Where
is the oil station man to turn”? And the
roadside restaurant owner? What is to be—
come of the Iumberman now that the gov-
ernment has cut off all non-defense build—
ing? Many men and their families depend
on these and similar methods of earning
a living. Their purchasing power will con-
tract, and with that will go decreasing busi—
ness for the dress shop, the grocery store.
In short, does this war mean that the small
town is to pass out of the picture?

The hand of government is slowly closing
around the economic heart of the small
town Since this political unit is the foun-
dation upon which American life is built,
the question of the small town is the most
important for lls to face in the years that
come.

 

 

LasI' Semester—

—Survey Shows

In a survey of the number of
cuts taken by upperclassmen and
freshmen last semester. it was
found that the upperclassmen av-
eraged 13 absences apiece, while
the freshmen had an average of
10, according to G. Gordon Ellis,

Haincs conquered Meats by c
score of 26 to s in the final wo—
men’s basketball game of the sea—
son last night in the gymnasium.

ning team were Dorothy Akcl‘»

men's counselor.

Before the advent of the “(ﬁlm
limited cut” sysocm, upperclass-
men were allowed 14 absences,
and freshman were allowed to cut
9 times. The survey has shown
that freshmen have taken advan-
tage of the system by one ab-
sencc, whilc upperclassmcn have
missed class four extra times,

The better and poorer students
tend to out class less often. while
the average group, those who
have a grade point average of
152.00 take advantage of the
system, .Ellis poinosd out,

These students who are on pro-
bation and have liclow a 1.5 av-
erage, on the wholc cut more than
the rest of the school, and they
are the my ones who should g'o
to class, he said.

As a rule students are not call-
ed in about excessive cutting un~
less their scholastic standards
show the diffcrcncc, One student
cut class 60 times during the
first semester, but was able to
maintain a 3.5 averagle, Ellis
pointed out.

To the Editor:

Word has come to me that the
student convocation devoted to
the installation of student officers
for the coming year was very
poorly attended by the student
body as a whole. This is distress-
ing to me because our students
Will make or brcnlr student goVr
crnment by the manner in which
they assume responSlbility for it.
The student leaders need the full
support of the faculty, the admin-
istration, and above all the stu-
dcnt body. A house president
cannot carry the load of the
house management, the president
of the Student Council cannot or
ticulate the needs nnd aspiration
of all the students with out guid-
ance, and the Council cannot legs
islate discipline, good will, morale,
or good taste.

Will you not consult with your
editorial associates as to the iris
dam of carrying on an editorial
mmpnig‘n which will awaken
students to the fact that a very
large part of men educational
experience is derived from their
effective pnrticipalion in student
affairs? Vi'ill you not point out
that them can be no freedom
without responsibility, there can
be no government which is frec
and libcral without self restraint
and sell descipline‘? Will you not
urge the members of the Grinncll
student body to realize that ilicir
stake is one of our most precious
tradiiions is grant and the “'61!
being of future geifcralians of
students depends in large measure
upon the respect they linic for
the tradition of free siudcnt gov-
crnmcnt in the college?

I should like the student Coilnr

associates and I are eager to work
with them in making our entire
institutional life effective, happy,
and significant. We stand ready
