Dibble's U. S. O.

For the ﬁrst tune in Grinnell
history a men’s hoiiseparty has
been invaded by the U, S. Army.
.Last Saturday night Company B
of the Grinch o. c. s. marched
in a body to Dibble liali and in-
vaded the houscparty being held
there.

But it was all a mistake, Conn
pany B insists. They weren’t at-
taching and they weren't in .
tionally crashing the party. RC-
port has it that someone was
playing a joke on the Dibble men,

One night last week it seems
the signs disappeared 5mm the
{rent of every hall hut Dibble!
and were found mysteiiously
smashed and battered, lv'ng on
the lawns or their respective
houses.

The men of Gates, Rawson,
Clark, and Smith were perturbed.
Heads got together. Schemes
were hatched.

Maybe It's The Atmosphere
Concluded L‘r. Canard, “There
are some people who are trying
to learn as much as they can
now, and there are others who
are having their fun while they
can get it. There is no universal,
appreciation of the fact that a
well—informed, \Vellrtl'zfned mind
will give‘both a better position
in the armed forced and a better
service to one’s country, However,
this lack of appreciation is less
a result of the war than of the
general college atmosphere."
