Rumor Has An Ugly Face---

There is much beating around of issues on
the front page of the Scarlet and Black this
issue, and we admit it. We don‘t like it.
Neither, Vie believe, does Dr. Stevens. No
one is deliberately playing the smug ChesA
hire cat. But there happens to be nothing
anyone connected with this college or with
any American college can say until higher
authorities in Washington speak first.

But there are a few rumors almost too
wild for serious consideration which can
be thoroughly debunked at this time.

1. This school is not going to close in
January. It is not going to close in March.
It is not going to close to civilian students,
period. That i the point of all other ar-
rangements which have been made or may
be made: our motto might well be ”Altera-
tion for Preservation.”

If you are a civilian, male or female, with-
out danger of call into armed services, there
will be a Grinnell college for you to attend
for the duration and after the duration.
More important there will be a Grinnell
college when tllere is no longer a war emer-
gency. That is the goal to which any dura-
tion sacrifice is aimed.

2. No navy school is coming to Grinnell
on January \7. Someday one may c0me——oi‘
an army school, or one for preflight train~
ing. We don’t know what or when—but don’t
look for uniforms when you come back from
vacation.

Money for this map has been
the war chest, and
Stewart McEliaVy. Dibble junior,
is in charge of it.

3. The women aren‘t going to move out
of the quad on January ’7 either. Cleveland
isn’t moving into Dibble. Absolutely no spce
cii'ic arrangements for housing students in
new quarters has been made for the simple
reason that our present housing conditions
are iii no current danger. Of course we may
be moved eventually, but you’ll know in
plenty of time to wash your sweaters alld
fillish your bridge hand. And you \ ill be
informed of the results of the War—Navy—

anpower meeting of last week just as soon
as anyone can be informed. Probably this
release will come to you through your news
papers at home dining vacation. More specL
fically, information concerning Grinnell w 1
be sent you in a letter from the college dur-
ing recess if the press releases are not com-
pletely clear.

Fee‘l’ on +he Ground

During wartime, miraculous changes ale
often effected almost overnight And
Grinnell has some of these quickechange ace
complishments to its credit. In an unbe—
lievably short time, the men’s dormitories
were turned into barracks, the administra-
tion of all officers’ school was set up alld
Grinnell men were transplanted into town
houses. But even in wartime, reality sets
limits to idealism, In some matters—and
we believe that the raising of war funds
from student contributions is one of them
eit is bette' to stick to realities.

The Grinnell War Chest Committee has
announced as its goal the purchase of a
completely equipped ambulance to be pl ~
sented to the Red Cross. And no organi-
zation could have a more noble purpose. But
here reality shows its ugly face.

Although the fundraising projects of
the committee have thus far been outstandc
ingly successful, the total amount of,funfls
raised to date is less than two hundred dole
lars. An ambulance, without equipment,
costs approximately 31500; an equipped one
sells for about $2500. At our present rate
of progress, two hundred dollals per semes-
ter, we will be able to send an ambulance
into active service approximately six years
from now. We hope that the nor will be
over by that time.

The plan of setting a definite objective
to work for in waltfund raising is a wise
one. But let’s set an attainable goal. How
about shooting our guns at an objective
which might be attainable by the end of
this academic year?

But undor strict supervision that
permitted not even the tiniest
glow of a match, Grinncll was
stuck.

They stumbled blindly into
rooms, tripping over the furniture

to radio programs that the army
hcd cancelled. They started hull
sessions and told jokes. They laid
bets as to who was in the room

marks like, “Gee! Dark, isn’t it?"

Then the lights came on. As
people began to move crouiid in
the unaccustomed brightness, the

they fell over the furniture.

During the blackout, it appears,
everyone fcll over at least one
piece of furniture, and some stu-
dents are reported to have trio

serious injuries resulted however.

Gl'innell students were at a
loss for amusement during the
blackout. Perhaps this was be
