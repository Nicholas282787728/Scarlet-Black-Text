THE GRID SCHEDULE: The 1942
football schedule has not been of-
ficially approved by the faculty
committee on athletics pending
further war developments

Prior to the present Japanese war,
the athletic department had de—
cided to eliminate one game from
the schedule in order to begin
basketball at an earlier date . . .

last year's varsity, has decided to
transfer to Washington university
in st. Louis, Mo, next semester.

AT RANDOM: The first call for
track has been issued, and track
coach G. Lester Duke hopes to
have a great number out
“With numbers, we can produce
a good team. The boys will be
doing themselves a great deal of
good as well as the team," ac—
cording to Duke. . Running is
the basis of all conditioning, and
our track team has always fin-
ished up among the top in all the
meets and relays. . . Some schools
have dropped compet ive athlet-
ics 'fl'om their curriculum,

This does not socm to be the cor—
rect way to meet this present
,cinergoncy. . . The athletic scher
dule for West Point and Anndpm
115 is going full speed ahead for
1942, and they, if any, institutions
should know how much competi-
tive sports build strength and en-
durance, which is what we need,

so
