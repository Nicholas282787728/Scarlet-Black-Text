$350 Cyclone Debt

Falls To Seniors

Fear Two Dollar
Assessment Per

Class Member

The possibility that the Sen-
ior class may be assessed two
dollars per member appeared
immellent today, when it was
learned that a representative of
the Stewart-Simmons Engraving
Co. of Waterloo would be on the
campus this afternoon,

The 1941 Cyclone, sponsored by
the senior class, owes the water-
loo firm $350 for debts incurred
in making engravings for last
year's annual, and the senior
class is responsible for their set-
tlement, according to Herschel
M. Colbert. preSidcnt of the Pub-
lication Board,

Colbert suggested in a letter to
Taylor that the class be assessed
two dollars per person to immedi-
ately make up the defzcitr Then,
it was hoped that collections
would c hue and the seniors
would be reimbursed, Colbert
said.

Clint Taylor, senior class pres-
ident, is opposed to such action
and said y:stcrday that it it is
forced upon the class he would
consider resignation,

“Ratlicr than assess the class,
we should throw a dance or have
some inilar function to raise the
necessary money,” the senior pres-
ident claimed,

Senior c as dues of 350 are to
be collected soon, Taylor said.
pointing out that nrno of the
money would go towards settle-
ment of the Cyclonc debt.

Cyclone business manager, has
refused to answer any requests
for information.

Kent Hampton, student Council
president, will try to see Car-
mody today in Chicago, according
to Taylor.

Taylor also said that Carmody
has refused to accept registered
