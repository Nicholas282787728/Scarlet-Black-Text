Apportion Semester Fee

Aihlei‘ics Given
-57 Percent Oi
To’ral Alloitments

Allocation of the semester
fee for the first semester of
1942-43 has been completed
and approved, the report of
tlle student council and incul-
vty committee of student or-
ganizaions revealed las night.

Again tlle athletic depart-
ment leads in the allocation,
with some/new campus or-
ganizations sharing in the dis
persnlent of funds. With the
'lowest enrollment in several
years, the total funds avail-
able have been curtailed, but
percentages Show a generally
slight change from former
yearsi

Athletic department allocation
has been out .25 per cent. to
55.50 percent. but a special item
for the athletic awards was ad-
ded, being given a grant of 1.5
percent of the semester fee
funds. Thus, the allocations to
athletics now amount to 57 per-
cent of total funds. Last year’s
allotment was 55.75 percent.

Another significant change in
apportionment is the grant to the
music lecture series. Last year
29 percent was granted for this
purpose; this year's fee distribu-
tion gives them 23.75 percent.
This cut of 5.25 percent was made
upon administrative recommenda-

 

tion because of their decreased
program.

The allotment to the Scarlet
mid Black was ~incrcased from
3 percent to 4, percent. This
change is in line ivith the coun-
cll's efforts to make the paper
less burdensome to the collcgc.

The band's allotment was ins
creased from 25 percent to 3
percent, while the allotment given
over toward payment of band un-
iforms was dccreascd from 1.5
percent to 1 percent, Glee clubs,
Choir, and Chorus have been
awarded 3 percent. as or group.
Actual distribution among these
groups is left to the discretion of
the music department.

The \Vomen’s Recreation Assoc
ciation was increased .25 percent
from 175 percent to 2 percent.

The Board of Religion was
granted .5 percent. Previously
it had no allotment.

Art, drama, the student Coun-
cil and student auditor allotments
remain the Same as last year.
The art allotment is .75 percent;
drama, 2 percent; student audia
tor. 1 percent; and Student Coun-
cil, 1.75 percent.

Allotments to intramural rela—
tions, men's debate, and women’s
debate were omitted this year.
It is explained that 1 percent
equals a maximum of $75 for the
year, providing that enrollment
remains above 500. Subject to
change, this distribution will hold
for the second semester also.

Student Council Aciiva’res
Scarlel' ‘& Black Suggestion

Ask Faculty
To Staqqer
Hour Tes+s

Following the suggestion of the
SCARLET AND BLACK, present-
ed in an editorial last issue, the
student council at a special meet-
ing last night, passed a motion to
recommend to President Stevens
and chairmen of the faculty, Prof.
Canard. that all professors be re-
quired to’announoe all tests tak-
ing more than half of the class
period.

The purpose of the recommend-
ed ruling is to make it possible
to stagger the tests over a long—
er period of time. The editorial
and subsequent council recom-
mendation came after the heavy
bunching of tests prevalent es-
pecially during the few days be-
fore the marks for midsemester
are handed iii. ,

Also discussed at die meeting
was the new War Chest Coor-
dinating committee. The members
of the committee announced last
night by William McKeon, presi-
dent of the council are; Frank

Burns, who was erroneously re-
ported by the SCARLET AND
BLACK as chairman of the Com<
mittee, representing the Student
Council; Peggy Gardner, repre-
senting the quadrangle war coun—
cil; William van Duzel‘, repre-
senting the men: and a member
of the faculty to be appointed.

The purpose of the committee
is two-fold, MCKeon said. First it
will coordinate Ell. the various
chest activities, and secondly,
raise the funds for campus war
projects.

Soldiers Entertain College

Despite the fact that U. s. p. or-
ganizations all over the country
will probably be weeping and
wailing more than somewhat,
the Grinnell Candidate school is
entertaining college students Sat—
urday night.

Grinncllians, however, do not
seem to be as eager to capitalize
on opportunities as do the men
in. our armed formcs, Paul Brem»
icloer, Gadabout president, cm-
phasized last night.

He announced that only thirty
tickets had been sold up to last
night, but there are still plenty
available for those who wish to
make last minute arrangements
with quad residents.

Dutch Holland and his 11 piece

is Fair Play

hsnd direct from the Play—Mor
ballroom of the Windy City, is
defying the rubber shortage to
make his one night stand here in
Grinnell,

Another feature or the Min-
tlu'y Ball—other than the re»
vcrsal of the generally ampted
social procedure in regard to
soldiers and civilians—will he
the presentation of professional
talent from Clumgo who will
oovort through two stage shows
during the ovoidng.

The fact that dancers may dis-
port themselves to the music of
another good band, other than
the local Skyliner combo. should
force students to think twice be-
fore skipping the hop.
