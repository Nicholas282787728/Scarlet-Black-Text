Group To Decide
Upon De’rails
in Two Weeks

Choosing to begin 12 month
operation in June rather than
in September, the faculty de~
cided yesterday afternoon to
hold a slimmer term, accord-
ing to Dr. Henry S. Condrd,
dean of the faculty.

The group also decided up—
on plans for seniors taking
comprehensives in January,
he said.

Three plans are to be con:
sidered by a committee, and
will be decided on within the
next few Weeks, Conard stat-
ed. The three plans are:

1. The four semester
system which is being used
by the University of Chi-
cage.

2. The three semester
system which is now in use
by Yale University.

3. A two semester plan
with a 12 week summer
term.

Two committees are to begin
work on this immediately and
other plans for the session, The
tuition and other details will be
decided by assigned committees,

student Votc For Move.

The decision was made on the
strength of a student vote in
which 280 were in favor of the
session. A large number of pros-
pective students have also indi»
catcd a desire to attend summer
school, Conard said.

“I expect 12 hours credit will
be given," he added.

Govciriimcnt In Favor.

The government is intercstcd in
having as many as possible take
advantage of the accelerated
program. The army has dcfinite-
ly stated that as soon as they are
well organized, they will take
college people at the age of 20.
The college student will get ad-
vanoement and consideration, over
men with loss training, he said.

Those seniors taking compre-
hcnsives now are excused from
exams as long as the professor
feels his grades arc satisfactory,
if not he has the right to test
him, Collard said.

if at any time during the sec-
ond semester at senior, who has
completed his comprehensives, is
drafterl he will receive his degree
provided his grades average a B,
Conard concluded.
