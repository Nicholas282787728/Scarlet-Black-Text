Doings

Susiain Proiesf—

The intramural hoard has decided
to sustain Smith Hall's protest
of the Dibble-Smith game and
has authorized a replay of the
game, John c. Tidesdalc, physi-
cal ediication head, announced
yesterday.

Dibble-s other score. a safety,
was also illegal. Fritz of Smith
was caught behind his goal after
he intercepted a pass, but the
rule says that the defending
tcarn must go behind his goal
under his own volition in order
that a safety be counted.

team probably Will play a picked
team from the Officer Candidates
seliool next Friday on Ward field,

al cheering sections and a tug of

ing South Road to a 12-0 score.
North Road slipped across two
touchdowns in the first quarter,
and thereafter were held score-
less.

Bud Baker ran the ball over
for the first touchdown, and a
few minutes later tossed a touch-
down pass to McKCon to account
for South Read‘s scoring Through
most of the game, however. col-
lins and Ryden of North iRead
were knocking down the South
Road passes. and North Head’s
line was holding.

Clark vs. Dibble,

Clark almost spoiled Dibble's
unbeaten, unscored upon record
Monday on cold, windswept Ward
field. Throughout the regular
playing period Clark stopped ev-
erything Dibble offered and even
scared Dibble with some scoring
threats.

Art Brody played a particularly
effective defensive game for
Clark. In the overtime, however,
Dibble broke loose and crossed
the goal line on the last of the
five allotted downs. Since Dibble
had gained more ground than
Clark had in its five downs, the
game went to Dibble 670.

Gates \‘5. Rawsnn.

Gates roared ovcr Rawson, 26-
0, Tuesday as Rawson duplicated
its poor performance ag‘a st
Dibble. Gates, always a scoring
outfit. tallied on tiiree passes and
an interception by Hart, Hart
also threw the scoring passes.

third period, and Brody scored in
the fourth period as he took a
pass from Kranse.

on a triple lateral lateral. Hart
took the hall and started to the
right and then handed the ball to
Eaton on a reverse.

den Matthews who took tlie ball

Should they win against Coe,

the Scarlet and Blacks confer»

a victory against Ripoii in the
final game of the season might
possibly put the Grinnell team
in second place in the confer

However, the Coe team, coaclie

coaches in this part of the coun-

eighth year at the Cedar Rapids
