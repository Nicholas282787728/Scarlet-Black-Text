Introduction of Plan,

The introduction of the letter
read in part, . , it is our opinion
that it is necessary to coordinate
the present governing bodies on
the campus into one operating
body. So that this may be ace

from halls rather than classes."

The Council of House Presidents
and League Board will meet as a
Student Council on questions re-

letter said.

Student Coullcll President.

Also in the letter was includcd

Receives Xmas
Gift from Army

By Clyde Bales.

Fred Pauls, Smith senior, thought
it was too early tor Christmas
gifts when he opened a large thin
package which he received inyes-
Lerday's mail. And he was right.
because the envelope proved to
be a questlonllaire from the
United states government inform-
ing Paiils that he is "in the army
now.”

Eight pages long,
print,” Paul: said in .ference to
the governmental missive. “It
would talic six corporation laws
ycrs a month to figure it out."

Pauls' draft number was 603»
he said, but his order number
was 2,008. However, the order
number on the papers he received
was 62.

”If it wasn't so otticial look-
ing, I'd think it was a joke," he
commented. ”There's been a mis-
talie somewhere, and I'm going
to write my congressman.”

bringing about the Pioneers’ de

he got away two times, scoring
tuo touchdowns. He also kicked
the two extra points, thus scor-
ing all of the points in a. game
which ended 14 to 0.
