.The Drake Trip.

To Mr. Deming should go the thanks for
the Drake trip,

It was well-organized, a lot of fun, and
almost everyone came home, slaprhappy but
sober,

Far from resembling a conducted tour a
la reform school. the trip was Arranged for
convenience only. The box lunches were
appetizing, the train pulled in on time, 50
taxies were waiting, the game was not dis-
appointing, and the train left 70 minutes
later, on schedule. The whole program work-
ed smoothly, and Mr. Deming deserves
credit for the organization,

The 310 students and faculty members
who went to Drake should also be com—
mended. Displaying enthusiasm and sports—
manship, the Gl-innell crowd couldn’t have
made a better showing.

Mr. Deming provided the means, and we
thoroughly enjoyed the results.

.Enrollment Drop.

The fact that the enrollment figure at
Grinnell has dropped this fall cannot have
caused anyone a great deal of surprise. The
same story may be heard in other colleges
and univeisities all over the country. The
draft of course, accounts for the loss of
many senior men, and the uncertainty of
completing a four year college course un-
doubtedly has affected the enrollment of
freshman men.

A comparison enrollment figures of
the colleges and universities of Iowa this
fall shows an average drop of 8 per cent. The
Grinncll figure is 13 per cent drop. Fifteen
per cent of this decrease is directly account-
able to students in military service; abollt
30 per cent represents students who were
needed out last year as unsuited for Grinr
hell; and there has been a drop of nearly
10 per cent in freshman enrollment.

This still leaves officially unexplained a
large group of students who have not re
turned to Grinnell this year. Can it be that
Grinnell is becoming a luxury that only the
privileged can afford? Or does this decline
in numbers indicate an even more funda-
mental trend? It is worth pondering

OChicago’s New Newspaper.

There are a number of interesting questions
that a ‘ise in our minds when we consider
Marshall Field’s proposed new morning
newspaper, “A. M.,” which he plans to
start in Chicago in direct opposition to
the Chicago “Tribune.”

If the publication is patterned after
“P. M.," ﬁeld’s New York newspaper which
operates on a policy of accepting no adver-
tising, we see a dismal future for it. For
“P. M." is read only by the pseudo-illtelleo
tuals, a group which makes up a Very small
part of the population.

But if “A. M." is published as a normal
newspaper, it will be intere ting to learn i'
the people of Chicago want 0 read a news
paper whose editorial policy is fair, square,
and conducive to sleep, or one which goods
them to a [my through insolent bigotry
like the Tribune.

In any case it will be interesting. But it
will be an e ‘elnely tough battle for the
newcomer, for the potential readers will
have to get out of the “Tribune habit."

To the Editor:

— By Bronk Kuhl -—

AROUND THE MIDVVEST:—The Beloit Round Table in its last issue
took the student body to task for the lackauaisical cheering attitude
it held during the Blue DcviHKohaivlc game. . . . “/9 hope that the
editor of the Essenbee will not. feel so inclined after watching the
Pioneer routers in action tomorrow afternoon. . . . In order to have
effective cheering it will be necessary for all the students to Sit in a
body, and not be spread out over the stadium. . . . To facilitate the
seating of the student body, Athletic Director G. Lester Duke plans
to admit Students through the north gate only. . . , The team comes
on the field for the final warmup about 1:45 and the band wul bc
out marching before the game, . . . It'll lic Wise to get over to the
stadium early. . . First come first serve.

ed that the trip to Monmouth would have to he made all tn

AT RANDOM: The ChafarGeorge football pool that was sold around
the dorms this Week is quite complicated to figure out, but accord-
ing to its sponsors, it is by far the rcirest pool that has hit Grill-
nell. . . Their chief supporter has been Bink Barnes. . . . Spelt
Columnist Max Moses of the Coe Cosmos has this Lo say about the
C02 Trformation: "A few Wiseacres are advocating that the Model
T have its spark-plugs cleaned and replaced after last week's show."
. . . More people have commented this week about the hue spirit
that the Pioneer gridders have shown, even after their gruelling battle
with Drake.

OUR PREDICTIONS: It wouldn’t surp ’sc us to see on
Ward Field Saturday afternoon a repetition of last year's
GrmnelHKnox game. . , . Beloit over Cornell. ». . . Monmouth
to will over Coe. . Lawrence to defeat Carleton. . .
Michigan to amble over Pitt. . . . Northwestern over Wisr
consin. . And we give Drake the nod over st. Louis.

It’s n good idea tourut, the

they dcscrve doing. they should
