lRoses Are Red, Violets Are Blue,’
lOther Flowers Are Other Colors

By John Barbour
Get out your pencil, get out

your paper, and then get the lead
out. for today is Valentine’s day?
the day when many hearts are
broken and many more give wayl
to rcolish flutters, owing to a
lame piece of paper with red ink,
lsplattrred all over it,
1 How did this ancient cusmml
start? it all began back in the‘
ldays ot the Hottenshots. a gang:
exiled from the “Skyliners”. The
‘m'igmatol‘ or the custom was ac
Hialfrbl‘t‘ctl Mexican by the namei
‘ of Manual Labor. an err-drummer.
1iMonual had taken up drumming
lbccause he was cymbalrminded.)l
» He had a had habit of slipping in-l
to girls dormitories and drink»,
,ing the water out of the house»‘
Lmothcr's patsipots In which they‘

lkcpt flowers to brighten the liveslv

oi their girls.

l Auyhoo, one night Manual had
‘lsnatched his usual pot of chry-l
lsantllcmllm Juice and had quite
la load on. Going back to his 'dorm
\slnging. “Put Down that Razori
strop. Dean. I’m Sharp Tonight",
he dccided to write his mother a!
lettm'. When he got to his rooml
hc round, much to his chagrin and

it tore into heart-shaped sheets.‘
Manual, by this time, was so
far gone that he could write onlyi

love you" to his mother. He
left the paper on his desk and
wandered to bed. .

Next morning the paper was
found by the maid cleaning his
room. She thought it was a mes»
sage for her and immediately pro-
posed to Manual. who. in a grog-
gy mood. accepted.

The next thing we know. some
