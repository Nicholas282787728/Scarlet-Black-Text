Research Determines

BEST ’FARINACEOUS FRUIT!

By Charles Glaman.

It is likely that Grinnell potato-
eatcrs will soon be munching on
the Ohio Red River Valley val-r
iety of spuds, according to L. V.
Phelps, college treasurer. Phelps
indicated that recent research,
carried on in co-operation with
his office by the potato-peeling
staff of die quadrangle kitchen.
has shown beyond doubt that
Oliio Red River valleys are the
potatoes ‘for Grinnell’s mechanical
peelei-s.

Selling at only $1.30 per cwt.
they have the outstanding char-
acteristic of being able to survive
the machinerpeeling operation

with a loss in weight of only
20.2%. An added advantage lies
in their ability to “mash up,”
Phelps added.
Spuds Flunk

Other varieties didn't fare so
well during the recent maneuvers
in potato-peeling research.

Idaho Russots lost only 20% in
weight during peeling; but the
fact remains that they cost $1.65
per cwt.

Also selling at $1.65 per cwt..
are Cobblers, and their peeling res
suits in the loss of 27.7% by
weight.

$1.55 per cwt., loses 26% by
weight in the peeling ordeal.

With the Red River Valleys
winning on scveral scores, it
would appear on the surface that
the investigation has completely
solved the potato problem. But
that is not so, Phelps said, Cur-
rent wet weathcr conditions will
not permit rural onioaiis to dig
their Red River Valley potato
crops.

Meanwhile, champions of Grin-
iiell kitchen economy are, in this

Products and Fabricated Walls
Will Create New Jobs for Grads, Woolfe Says

izcd vocational ti 'ning will meet
the need, Woolfe said.

The demand for teachers is
prevalent now but in the iutnrc
this field will offer fewer jobs
unless the general level of educa»
tion riscs, or unless thc average
size or classes is reduced, he
stated. The population is getting
more and more adult and there
are fewer elementary people in
the United States. The trend, ace
cording to Woolic, is showing in
the schools right now.

There is it shrinkage of jolts
in the age group from 20 to 24,

and an expansion of jobs catering
to older groups Health resorts
for the agcd are increasing and
wul probably continue,

The trend in government and
indust 'is toward using more
statisticians, he stated, There is a
need for skilled workers in all”

electricity and machine tools.

A trend is developing to replace

Council Plans
Focus of All ,

Social Sys’rems

New Executive Commii‘iee
Plan is Proposed +0
Organize College Events

An attempt to combine the
various college social systems
under one united head is be

ing considered by the stu-
dent council, according to Kent
Hampton, president of the group.

Under the proposed social sys—
tem, an executive committee
would meet once a week to or-
ganize and produce ideas for col-
lege functions.

The group would be composed
of a dorm social chairman, a
quadrangle social chairman, the
hcad of thc Gadabout club and
two assistants, one a co-cd, and
the recreation chairman of the
student council.

The executive committee would
meet once a month with all cot-
tage, hall. and class social chair-
men to discuss and plan coming
events.

“As yet there is no co-ed to as
sist James Miles, Gadabout presi-
dent, so women interested in the
job should contact me not later
than Thursday,” Hampton said.

In its last meeting, the council
voted to erect a large bulletin
board in the A. R. H., Hampton
stated. This board will feature
the day's events, and also list the
week's schedule of attractions. In
addition, space will be devoted to
the activities of various campus
organizations. After a talk with
Mach ’1‘. Henderson, faculty their-
man of the committee on educa—
tional policies, Hampton continued
that it is very improbable that a
retum to the A B c D method
of grading will be made this year.
However, it is possible that
changes in the present system
will be devised during this year.
