Take The $ Ou’r Of $am

There hasn’t been’ much wailing and
gnashing of teeth over the $200 raise here
at Grinnell. The increase in students’
wages, the fact that all who applied on the
basis of need after the raise was announced
got e tra scholarships or loans, the obvious
inﬂation everywhere 7 these are some of
the reasons why tlle raise was understood.

But when a c V WAS heard, it was
usually directed against President Stevens.

We ran a cl tical editorial, likewise ill?
rected at the president.

And we don’t intend to take it‘bdclc.

However, we’ve run onto an interesting
thing or two about the president and money.
Out of the fairness with which we’re usual—
ly credited, we want to pass, along to you
the things he heard. We suppose they’re
rumors. That is, they’re rumors only inso~
far as the ultimate source, President Stev-
ells, who won't confirm them # except for
one case in which the AS & B had already
published the information.

But we scouted around a bit and
got all the off-tlle-l'ecord confirmation
we need. It’s the truth, believe us.

Here it is: When the trustees raised
$125,000 for the new science building, Dec.
12, the contributions were started off by
the president personally —— to the tune of
$20,000, cold cash.

The president is in for $30,000 for the
new organ, to which Vice President and
Mrs. Chrysler are also contributing heavily.

During his first three years here the
president contributed $30,000 in cash to
general development,

Mind you, these aren’t gifts made To
the president; they’re made BY the presi-

THE
. $AFE WAY CAB Cd.

Do it the easy way — The Safe-Way.

Exl’r January Jinx

January, in the schools of higher learn
ing which runs on the semester basis, may
well be considered a hectic month. Hectic
indeed, with final exams looming upon the
horizon of the returning student's mind#
a mind yet holiday»clouded and seemingly
bereft of any memory of pie-vacation exr
posure to knowledge,

Out of the din arises what we deem
to be a noteworthy proposal e a proposal
which is liable to immediate rejection clue
to its academic unusualness~which merits
close inspection. It is, in sllort,. that the
January period of intense pain and suffer-
ing be moved forward to pre»holiday De—
cember and that the timediscrepancy be
made up by starting school at the first of
September.

Our weary student would then re-
turn from Christmas vacation, at the
usual time, to start a shiny new semes-
ter in early Januaryghaving wound up
the old semester’s Work, as a unit, prior
to departing~and would finish ill
either the first or second week in May.

We should consider well the value of
thus completing each semester's work as a
unit, both from the standpoint of possible
higher academic achievement and that of
having the Christmas vacation perform its
true functionirelavation.

Mid-year ,g ldualiug s t u d e u t 5
would thus be relieved of having to re-
turn for a few weeks only to leave
again, and the sprin graduating class
would have, so to speak, a few weeks
jump on the national graduating class,
regarding employment possibilities.
Also, semester e uus would be removed
from 2) notoriously bad health month.

A glance at the other side of the ques-
tion reveals the liialor objection to be that
the beginning 01' the second semester would
not be synchronous with that ol‘ the sec-
ondary schools nor with that ol' the other
semester-basis colleges. The influx of mid-
year students is, however, slightly more
than negligible, and the administration
would doubtless welcome the absence of
this annual headachei

September's warm days would in ulli
probability be more than compensated for
by the complete relaxation gained at Christ-
mus time and by the earlier release in May.
Former summer school students, who swel-
tered through July and August, will fur.
nish ample testimony that September’s
warm weather is nothing.

Once the academic newness is brushed
aside, such a proposal may be seen to have
real merit. Think it over,
