O The “Gadabouts”.

The social problem may be solved. It also
may continue to be a black mark on what
should be normally a well-balanced educar
tional program. Perhaps the solution rests
with the program organized by James Miles
and tlle Gadabout club. We hope it does.

For years, Gl'inllell’s social program has
slowly become stagnant, with last year’s
dances making the worst record in history.
Not enough rn . lg at dances and too lunch
going steady have both contributed to this
condition,

The revised social program is designed to
meet the whims of everyone. There is a
little bit of everything, hilt not too much
of anything. Dances, skating parties, hay
rifles, and other features are all included in
the bargain.

To succeed, the Gadabouts need the com-
plete support of the student body. Without
support of the student body, the Godabouts
fail. If the Gadabouts fail, another year
of social oblivion is ill store for Grinnell.

We aren’t asking you to buy tickets.
We’re telling you.

0 Grades Again.

Do you remember last year’s discussion by
the Student Council concerning Grinnell‘s
own peculiar grade system? It’s back again.
Arid this year we believe that the issue
should go beyond faculty “discussion”; the
Scarlet and Black calls for definite action.

If we review the facts a little, we’d find
that there was a widespread desire among
students and faculty alike last spring to
bring back to Grinncll a grade system
understandable at other schools. It is to he
noted that the five point system is admire
able, perhaps ahead of the times, provided
that Grinnell could get all the other schools
to change. This is impractical, so it seems
wise to have Grinnell make the change
instead. We need a system that students
and parents can fully comprehend. A sys-
tem that will be accepted by graduate
schools without question, {or it seems un»
fair to our students to make them suffer
at the hands of a too progressive grading
system.

Tile ideal body to take this up is our Stur
dent Council. Off to a line start last year,
it can continue ill the right way by not
letting the faculty lose sight of this ime
portant objective. Who knows, perhaps this
year‘s preps will be get llg “A’s” again!

AT RANDOM: We see a good chance ior the Pioneers to bring linmc

Drake tangle in the 491.11 renewal of the series which dates back to
