VARIETY SHOW

Showing the
tween art and music was the
purpose of an honors colloquium
project completed at s iiestcrs by
an major Barbara w ght, Main
eenior.

The work, which wrll be entered
in the steincr contest, consists of
five record album covers, done
in gauche or poster paint, illus-
trating one musical composition
each from the pre classic, the
classical, the romantic, the inn}
pressionistic, and the contempo l
cry periods.

Miss Wright’s Iavol‘lte cover is
that ol the romantic period for
which she interpreted the finale
of Weber's “Der Frerschutz.u The,
very emotional tone or the music,
depicting a wolf glen with howls
irig wrnd, bats, and drums, per-
mitted the use of territie satur-
ate colors and strong diagonals
to create the feeling of unrest
and excitement," said Miss
wirglrt.

“Another reason why
‘Der Fl'cischutz’ especially." she
said, “is that I saw the picture
immediately while listening (0‘
ﬁle nrusic and carried it out‘
without change." i

The other compositions which-
Mrss \Vright expressed in paint-‘
ing are PergakSl's “Le Serva Pa-
>dx‘onna” tor the pie-classic pcr-
iod; Mozart's “Symphony in G
_Mlllol‘” for the‘classrcal; Dc~
ussys “Festivals” tor the rm-
pressionistic; and Mcnotli's “Se—

Problems which Miss-“wi-
encountered in the course of h
work were putting the feeling
at the music into the design;
matching the musical period and
the artistic period; using colors‘
and style which characterized the
particular art movement and, at
the same time, keeping colors,
that would express the music
and printing the necessary into .‘
mation on the cover as part of‘
the design and' still maintainingi
the printing style at the period.‘

“I went off on some tangents,
finishing a sketch without realrz-‘
irrg that 1 had completely forgot‘
ten to coordinate one of tliei
elements," Miss Wright contessed.‘

:‘The pmject was very interest—-
ing and worthwhile," she said,
“because I like both art and
music." However, in a true ar-
tistic manner, she revealed somel
