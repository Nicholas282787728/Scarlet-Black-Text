The Grinnell cage sqiuid. uitli

opens an eight gilmc home sched-
ule tonight in Derby, when it
plays host to the inyoding quim
tet from Knox. Then, next Vi’erl<
ncsdny night, Coo engages the
Pioneer team here on the home
court.

Last year the Scarlet and
Black team won both games from

Galesburg, lll, Hit hard by grad-
uation, Knox seems dependent
this year upon sophomores and
juniors to carry its burden.

Coach Pfitsch is expecting a
tough game from Knox, basing
his expectation on comparative
scores of their mutual opponent,
Augustana, The Augies defeated
Knox by a score of 37733, while
Grinnell was victorious over the
Rock Island. Ill.,, five by a 52-
46 margin,

Wednesday, Coe will b 'ng to
Grinnell a fastehl‘czlk type of
basketball, necessitated by their
lack of height. Four lettermen.
Squib Collins, Charley Pisel, Bob
Greene. and Jim Saivtell, form
the backbone of Coach Lamb's
crew which is out to better last
year’s record of 4 wins and 6
losses in conference competition.
In warm-up games this season,
the Kohawks have fallen before
Simpson and Iowa State.

Coach Pfitsch is pleased with
the showing made by the Pin-
neers in their first two games.
“The difference in scoring of our
previous games is easily explain-
ed,” said Pfitsch. "In the Aug-
ustana game, we had our share
of.good shots and made good on
them, while at Cornell we were
continually pressed with the re-
sult that our shots were hurried
and thus inaccurate.

“Dave Dunlop. Glenn Saunders,
Bill Toomey. and Jim Heiny
have played steady, dependable
ball so far, and I feel that we
simply had a bad night at Cor-
nell, and getting it out of our
system was good for us,”

The Pioneer cage squad will re-
turn to Grinnell Dec. 28 in order
to ready themselves for the air
nual holiday basketball tourney.
to be held Dec, 31 and Jan. 1 in
Polls. The host team, Central col-
lege, was last year's winner when
the tournament s held in Grin-
nell. The other two teams in the
holiday affair are Coe and Cor-
nell.
