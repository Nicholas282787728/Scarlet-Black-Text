Although as the pllllman porter said,
platforms are not designed to ride on, but
only to get in on, the published platform of
a successful candidate places its allthor
under obligation at least to attempt to
carry it throu h. Too often political prom-
ises made ill t e heat of the campaign are
forgotten immediately after the election,
and campus affairs of state fall into the
same old rut. Personalities and the relative
efficiency of political machines seem to
be the deciding factors after all.

The platforms of the past seem to
break down logically into a few general
types of promises which are made in one
form or another almost every year.

Items which are in the wind, are
hound to come to pass, and which can-
didates seize upon in the hope of
making political capital of them: “1 ads
vocate a suitable student union . . .
Although there is some talk of a pr -
posed union, our candidate will take
initial action to further this program.”

The patently desirable proposal which
is so obvious that every platform contains
in it some form or another“ “A pressing
need exists for reorganization of extra-
curricular activities in order to eliminate
overlapping.” This type of plank is noted
{or lack of any definite plan for its realiza-
lon.

leaves us right where we were before:
“Greater cooperation between the Student
Council and house councils will make for

more efficient student government.” Amen,

so be it.

The truly constructive proposal
which the particular candidate believes
Should be accomplished, and attempts
to bring about: “Expand the coopera-
tion between our Student Council and
the Middle Western Student Council
association.”

In looking over the platforms of lead-
ing’ candidates from last year, we
struck by olle fact above all: there is so
little difference in any of them, That is
as it should be, for campus problems a
any one time are apparent to everyone. An-
other characteristic common to all was the
lack of concrete suggestions as to how the
various aims were to be accomplished. A
candidate will betray his sincerity by the
means which he intends to employ.

So, in outlining and considering plat-‘

forms this year, let both candidates and
voters check them against a few simple
criteria. 15 there really a need for what is
advocated, or has it been made up out of
whole cloth just to gain attention; in other
words, are issues being manufactured? Is
it within the province of student govelli-
merit?

Is it an attempt to make political
capital of an accomplished or a nearly
accomplished fact:7 Can Something
really be done about it?

Above all, how is it to be done?

Iversal measures can be published

make the withdrawal of my name

Dear Editor:

In order to acquaint students
with my views, I offer the follow-
;ing as a portion of my platform l
I propose to increase the efficienr‘
cy of the Student Council rep-
.resentntion by changing student
ICounoil meetings to Thursday

.afternoon. In this way, contra-l
l

 

I suggest that on the student
Council be placed s representa-
tive of the married couples for
the purpose of maintaining their,
interests

Many students are taking coma,
scs they don’t want or need}
through the inefficiency of the,
present counseling system. There;
fore, I suggest 2|. more thorough,
and well organized soedemicl
counseling system, especially dur-,
ing New Student days. This;
could he accomplished throughi
pl'o»registl'ation counseling by re-i
spansible upperclassmen.

I propose that time be given
during the freshman orienmtion‘
program to inform new students}
of the student governmental sys-l
tem et Grinnell.

I Suggest An Infernal Dis-
cussion Among Candidates For
The Purpose Of Presenting
And Defending Views. This
Will Give The Student Body
Oportunity To Know All Cen-
didates And Their Platforms.

Sincerely,
Frank Sanders
