From The Prexy

Dear Editor,

I would like to take this opportunity
to thank all those who supported me in tlle
past election. I would also like to ask the 1
student body for support throughout the
coming year and assure students that I will
do the utmost to give them the kind of
student government they want, active,
capable and responsible

We pay $1200 a year for the privilege
of coming to Grillnell. it seems a shame
that so many are not derh ng full benefit
from this outlay of money. Here I speall'
of the larger issues involved —— not whether
your desk has a hole in it, or you don’t
like beets a la Harvard 7 here I mean the
fullness of life at Grinnell. This fullness of
life includes the less obvious things that go
to make a liberal arts college, and especial-
ly Grinnell; what it is — a place where olle
may secure that inner freedom that enables
us to think our own thoughts in a crowd
ed subway or all empty room.

Among these things are: Concert
Series, art exhibits, Student Government,
and the close Contact witll men of letters
and affairs that chapel, Frair’s discussions
and IRC afford us,

We have offered to us here at Grinnell
freedoms, mediums of discussion, and con-
tact with faculty and administration that
very few colleges are able to offer. More
interest and participation ill these things
and others, plus the formal side of aca»
demic life, will go far in aiding us to rid
ourselves of the limitations of the group
mind — the bane of every civilization ._
and give to all of us a richer college ex
perience.

Sincerely,

Frank J1 Sanders

Thereis an old, old, joke, (See Mal-
teaser, also something of an old joke)

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

which cverworks the words “matriculate",i
“curriculum,” and “thesis," with respect to
studentefaculty relationships. Now, al»‘
though our student—faculty relationships
have not become that informal at Grinnell,
it is time to take notice of the fact that
feeling between faculty members and stu-
dents is rapidly becoming more easy and
informal, With no trepidation we greet that
fact.

The awesome display of talent by fac-
ulty members during intermission at the
Mardi Gras, the whole-hearted sacrifices
made during the intermission auction at
the Potpourri, and the efforts of the Friars
to bring faculty wisdom into north campus
b}lll sessions, 7 all have contributed _to
lend an increasingly pleasant COnnOtahOll‘
to the idea of “getting an education."

Students are realizing that doctors of

 

 

philosophy can perform some function
other than that of keeping people awake}
for a specified number 01' hours each week,
Instructors are realizing, thanks to Friars,
that male Grinnell students are occasionally
concerned with something besides girls,
gell, and gaiety. "All told, we’ll bet a nnm—g
ber of people of various ages have been
pleaslntly surprised during the past few
weeks.

Here, then, is evidence of the true
spirit of liberal education: a faculty human
enough to “unbend” before its students,
even though such unbending has no peda»
gogic value, and a strident body interested
enough to continue its pursuit of knowledgel
in what it considers its spare time.

Orchids are in order, and neither the
“admillisterial Colossus” nor the student
Welter is to have credit alone. Each has‘
advanced to meet the other, to the mutual
benefit of both, in this business of line
proving student»faculty relationships.

ON THE ll

SEE/My .‘

SIDE

By Pete l-lackes ,
After what little smoke there"
was had cleared last Monday,:
Frank Sanders had Won the sc
presidency by some 30 or 40‘
votes. Looks close, It was. 1
But where were the over-aool
votes which were not cast? This
year’s alleschool election pollcd‘
but 300 out of a possible 1125;
with nearly a fourth of the stu
dent body not votlllgl ,
Just what the reasons may bel
for this apparent lack of interest,5
we cannot say. Rather than crit—l
in e here, i would like to devote-
the remainder of this week's cor
umn to some things which it
seems in mo might be considered}
by the new so prexy and his}
cohorts when they go about re-
vlewmg the election Just past.
They aresmere suggestions,
(many of which have already
been discussed) and are offered-
lll the hope that future sc cam
paigns may again take on the
aura of keen, honest contests
among the seven or eight "top
ten" which once characterized
the sc race, making it the he el
note of second semester acti
ties. Here they are:

1. Change the duties of the sc
president by the inclusion of a
so vice president so that me
president will stllI have the over
all duties and responsibilities but
can turn over much of his busi-
ness to the other person a ap~
pointed by the council or by nun

2, Explore the possibility of a
limited salary for the SC prexyi
Both points one and two will
help to make the job more inc
viting to other good men. The
clies of “takes loo much time

. no reward . . . would have
to give up too much , . may
subslde, thus keeping a max min
number of people in the race.

a. Clear up the election rules
where points are omitted, wording
sloppy, or items repeated, How,
for instance, can the electlon
board give an lntel'pretaLion of
“359; of the total vote” as her
ing 35% of the votes cast when
another section of the same rule
states that two nominees must
receive “359; of the delegates
present" lpresumably all those
on the floor, Thls and several
other cloudy points should be
cleared up by a. review of the en-
tire procedure.

4, Publish a tentative list to alll
eligible juniors before “top ten"l
elections so that, if they wish,
they may indicate their disin-
clinaLlon to run before the bale,‘
loting A check of the seven whol
dropped out of this year’s race
shows that five of them would
definitely have declined before
the ”top tell” balloting!

5 Publish election list early so
that all voters 1n the primaries
may have a chance to acquaint
themselves \vth those eligible.
Here the so would have to cheek

Mr, Jlln Scott, Editor l

Grlnncll College 3
Grinnell, Iowa ,
Dear Jim: ,
It was certainly a pleasure to‘
be on the campus of Grlnnclr
college during the last week and

l pal icularly to speak at the chapel

service sunday morning. .'
While I was in Grinnell, some-

such matters, and I want you to,
know that I appreciate it

While on the campus inwas‘
possible for me to meet a mem-
ber of your professors and al
numbn- of your students, and I
was vely grateful for the con-
tacts and the splendid fellowship
of which 1 saw evidence.

I sincerely hope that you will,
enjoy your year’s work and that'
your paper will continue to be
the leader in all types of activr
ties throughout the campus.

Most sincerely yours,
Walter A. Graham

6. Have election board mem-
bers [unless impossible) members
of halls other than those of the
ten top candidates. This, along
with many others, is already an
unwritten law. it would be in the
interest of all, however, to set
them all down l

7. Rule on the eligibility of l
Withdrawn candidates who wish
to become convention delegates.

:3. Clear up the business of cam
didates classified as not “ofﬁcial-
ly out of the race" until their
letters of withdrawal are read ,
on the conventlon floor.

9. 1 see no reason (along with 1
many othersl why juniors who
lack a few academic hours cane
not be included in the possible 1
candidates, pronded they produce ;
a truly representatlve petition of
some sol-t.

If such students sign a
“pledge" to graduate either in
June or August of the following
school year (Via summer school)
why not let them runilf they
have enough student support?

These then are a few ideas on
present election procedure.
Hope a more efficient set of rules
can be devised for the future.
See you next week seemtlme.
