Tougher Conference Faced \Ripon Rega

l o o
By 'Inexperienced Pioneers Midwesl' I'He

“I wzun’l at all disappointed. In
my opinion, the conference was
fully 50% stronger this year man
it was the previous season. In fact.
playing defending champion Lam's
rence and then Carleton on suc-
cess -c weeks in the early part of
the season was certainly a tough
lit-ginning." »

This ‘was the opinion of head
football Coach ”Bunny” Oakes ye -
terday when asked about the re-

, cent football season. Coach :Oakes
pointed out that there were 9 187
year-olds on the Grinnell team who
had come up from the unbeaten

, fi-osh eleven. Besides this Cxperlr
ence, 10 starters were lost from the
previous years varsity, not to man

, tion 2 or 3 good reserves.

“EG Booth and Keith Olson are
the only two starters graduating
this year," stated the former Unis
,versity of Wyoming mentor. “It
should also be remembered that
neither OIson nor Bud Gregg play-
ed any football while in high
school, Add to this the fact that

i the majority of our starters were
sophomores, lacking in experience,
and you have the situation on this

’ years team.

"Although it was early in the,
season, the encounter with Carlo
ton was our best game, We cap ‘
talized on a break in the Homes,
coming game with Coe, the result;
being that we won. The Knox‘
and Cornell games could have been‘

Now in his second year at Grins
nell, Coach Cakes stated that Im»
proveinent was definitely noticed
on the team as the season pro-l
grossed. Among those men men-
tioned were Del Eggers, whose
puiiting was exceptionally good. EG
Booth and Jack Thellman, both of,
whom were valuable on offense‘
and defense alike and Bill Hooks.
who rapidly developed his punting,
and passing as the season wore on

and is fast becoming a triple threat l Peters was good [or 36 yards and “mammal

man.

Coach Cakes noted that “Wash
ington university was at their peak
for us. Our psychology reversed
against us, but as a result they
were beaten Saturday in their
Homecoming encounter by West»
ern Michigan by a score of 1976."

Looking ahead, ”Bunny" stated
that "the outlook for next years'
eleven is very good. The experi
ence gained this year will be iri-
valuable, and there are a good
hunch of freshmen coming up who
should work in nicely with the re—
turning veterans."
