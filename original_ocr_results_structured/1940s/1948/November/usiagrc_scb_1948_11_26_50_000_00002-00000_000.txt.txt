To Give Is Blessed
To Give on Time -- Divine

Grinnell’s 1948 Community Chest drive has passed, and

with it, the student’s chance to participate in this worthy ,

and necessary fundrraising campaign.

Tlle Charge is often leveled at college students every-
where that, upon entering their' ivory towers of learning,
they leave behind the workaday world and all consciousness
of its continued existence. Though there were many who
did help in the campaign, and many more who contributed
considerable sums, the total collection on the campus shown
ed that a great majority gave little or nothinggeven con»
sidering the proverbial poverty of college students.

That we are members of the city community can hardly
be denied, especially by those who voted here in the recent
elections That members of a community have certain re»
sponsibillties and obligations to that community must also
be granted. Even though the Community Chest campaign
has passed, there are still ways of showing this awareness
of civic duty, the development of which is one of the ma-
jor goals of our education.

One way of demonstrating a real Christian, as well as
civic consciousness, would he to make a success of the pro-
posed Christmas party for the boys and girls of Uncle Sam’s
club. The energetic cooperation of students and adminlsv
tration in brightening the holidays of these kids would
prove that it is not only more blessed to give than to re

ceive, but a lot more fun too.

‘To Be Great --
Give Yourself ’:
Pres. Stevens

“If you really want to be
great, he a servant,” sald Dr.
samucl N. Stevensin hisThanks-
giving chapel address in ARI-I
auditorium Thursday morning.

Speaking on “The Fine Art of
Being Used" DY. Stevens pointed
out the paradox between Christr
ian nature and human nature. He
said that human nature says
“Get, be secure. use other people,
be master.” while Christian na»
Lure says "give, live dangerously,
be used, be the servant of all."

"One of the great social probe
lcms of our times is the problem
of organized charity," Said Dr.
Stevens as he expressed the dan-

lger of giving too much.

The solution of the problem of

thc fine art of being used is to
have the subtle something Jesus
put into his gifts, Dr, Stevens
concluded.
- Beverly Bond and George Hal~
sey assisted in the liturgy of thc
worship, and the Grinnell choir
under the direction of David B.
Secular furnlshed the music.
