History Making (-3. Q. P.
Or Bellyac'ning H. S. T.

In :lpplovmall‘ly two weeks, milli 0[ vols
qrs throughout the nation will go to the polls and
will elect as next president of the united States
Thomas E Dewey. Their reasons for doing so

to iindeistand. The Republican pulty
,eill establish a muchrneedctl, unity, The Repuh
can patly’s candltlalc is a wise, diplomatic man
,vith lore gut The platform of the Republican
)al’ly is a sound one.

If the United states government is screaming
or a y one paramount need in these days of grave
ltlenlatlonal crises it is screaming for unity. The
Deu‘cyAVal-l'en team has, since the my beginning
1f the campaign, stressed the fact thiat we must
)5 a united people, for only then will we have
:lie strength to meet our responsibilities.

We must, as a nation, maintain our economic
and financial stability, We must meet, however
not onl‘ financial responsibilities but also oui—
responsi lies to mankind, If we are gum” to
discharge these obligations, we must have a hull-i
ed people with a united government. Any candi-
date for public office, be he Democratic, Repuhw
ican, or third party, who does anything to dwidel
the American people, is doing this country tremen-
dous damage. Any president of the United states
who speaks at a Labor day program at an indus-
trial center such as Flint, Mich, and tries to niahe‘
labor hostile to management for his own person-i

a1 political gain is doing the country tremendous
damage.

‘The President of the Untied States holds the
nation's highest elective post. We cannot elect a1
man who lacks the nccssat‘y stature, and foresight“
to negotiate vital matters of national and iiiterEa-i
tiooal importance. We can not, and ive will not,,
elect a man as president at the United states ivhol
has consistently stumbled and bungled, who hasl
repeatedly put his foot directly into his mouth. ,
Very recently, before the eyes of the world 1
Mi, Truman did it again when he pounced upon;
the bright idea of sending Mr. Vinson on a 11057
cow mission, Beyond a doubt, President Tmmanl
did not wish to overstep the liimts on this matri
ler before the United Nations. We are siue hel
did not intentionally ignore Secretary of state
George Marshall. But he did ignore himvso much
so, in fact, that Mr Marshall came rushing home
in a state of frenzy. This is but one inslauco,‘
There are many more. None of them are isolatr‘
ed. All of them have a very direct bearing on
many othei vital matters which, taken as a whole,
affect the United states vitally. Can we have a
man completely incapable of seeing things in then
tiuc perspective at the head of our government?
, The Democratic party has destr _~ed itself bv
inner conflict. Today it is separated by difteii-
ences so wide and so deep that it IS incapable ot
‘ and effective leadership
which oui nation so urgently needs. The Demo-
cratlc party at present is bankrupt of eftieicnc ‘
Governor Dewe' and Governor “’al'l‘en's fli’st-‘
vale administrations are but pievieivs of coming
attractions, indicative of the effective and respon-
sible leadership which the Republican party has
to offer. In Albany and in sacramenlo we have
observed close unity in government and adminis-
trations responsible to an of its citizens. In Wash-
ington we -have seen nothing but confused bung-
ling, strife, and inconsistency.
, Let us consider platforms. IL is immediately
apparent that the Democratic platform (to say
nothing of Demceiatic campaigning; considers
largely of “bellynching,” The Democratic plat~
rot-m delves back into history, giasping bits of
past glory much as a drowning men desperately
clutches a small piece or driftwood. They must
do this, for they cdnnot look ahead and predict a
glorious future when they must realize that their‘
bungling candidate is cepuble of leading them only
into confusion and inconsistency,
, The Democratic platform says: “Wc shall en-
deavor to remove tax inequities and to continue
to reduce the public debt." They shall endeavor,
indeed! They have always endeavored and suc-l
needed in raising taxes to astronomical heights!
not using the increased revenue to reduce the um i
ional debt, but foolishly suiiandeiing the added
income due to their outrageous, inexcusable waste. l
The Republican platform on the same subject,
states as its attainable aim: "Thc maintenance or;
federal finance in a healthy condition and coutlnu- ,
tom of, the efforts so wcll started by the chllbri
lican Congress to reduce the enormous burden ofl
to provide incentives for lhei
creation of new industries and new jobs, and to
bring relief from inflation. We favor lntclligent‘
integration of fodcralrstntv‘ taxing and =nendlng
policies designed to eliminate wasteful dup- i
llcatlon, and in order that the state and local gOVrl
