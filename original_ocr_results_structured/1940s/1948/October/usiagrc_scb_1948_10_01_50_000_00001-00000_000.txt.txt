Green Hue Will Not Play
Maior Role In Chapel

“There will be some green in the
chapel decoration," President Stev-
ens announced Thursday, “but
that color will not he predomin-
ant."

The Scan-let and Black, following
up on a Student’s complaint that
the chapel would be udecorated in
green, too," got the word on what
that edifice will look like inside
when completed.

“Several coats of paint will be
applied,” said Dr. Stevens, "with
glaze between each coat. The final
coat will be an antique finish
which should result in an aged»
looking antique amber.

”To further create as much cath-
edral effect as possible, the beams
will be rubbed with a wax and
grey paint mixture. This will give
an aged appearance to the wood
without changing its color much,
and at the same time will help
to preserve it.

"The vestibule will be tiled in
a quarry red color; and a wine
velvet runner will be laid from the
vestibule to the altar. The altar
itself will be new, as well as the
reredos against which it stands."

For illumination, 12 bronze fix-
tures. each three and one-half
feet high and made on a cathedral
pattern, will be hung. Six will hang
in the nave, one at each of the
three center arches, four in the
chancel, and two in the balcony.

These fixtures are the gift of
Mrs. Henry Bigelow Galloway, '96.
and they will be controlled by The»
ostat to insure the proper amount
of light for the type of function
in progress.

One unfortunate note in all
this. said Dr. Stevens in essence,
is that temporary seating will have
to suffice until a permanent type
is installed next January or Feb-
ruary. Since the college was not
ready to accept delivery on those
ordered previously, the permanent
seating designed for Herrick
Chapel was shipped to another cus»
tomer.

Stevens Explains
Noon Meal Delay;
Assures Improvement

In answer to a pointed ques-
tion concerning the delay in ser-
ving noon meals which has calls»
col widespread tardiness at 1 o’-
clock classes, President Stevens
said Wednesday, “The dining
room at Cowlcs is in a period of
LransiUol-i, and although tempor-
ary measures established could
feed only seven men per minute
at the outset, they have improv-
ed to a point where we now serve
24 men per minute."

The kitchen staff has done a
good job, according to President
Stevens. At Sunday dinner last
week the Quad dining room ser-
ved 900 meals with only a five-
ininutc delay at any attempting,

Installation of new equipment
at Cowles has been under way
for three days and should be fine
ished within ten days. The usual
installation time for this equip-
ment is from 16 to 20 days. The,
delay now being experienced was
caused by the late arrival of
$25,000 worth of equipment de-
signed to make Cowles kitchen
as complete and modern as that
ho the Quad.

When finished, it is probable
that 30 meals will be served pcr
minute. At that time the dining
hall proper will be rearranged to
prondC more room for diners.
This wil be made possible by
feeding two halls on an early
shift.

Barlett Speaks
In ARH Chapel
On Being Free

Bartlett Speaks . CH

“You Will be free spiritually
only when you belong to another,"
Rev. Gene Barlett of the First
Baptist church in Evanston, Ill.,
stated in his chapel address, en-
titled “So You Want to be Free,”
yestcrday morning in ARH audi-
torium.

“While we may master circum-
stances by confident assertion of
our mastery over things, we find
inner freedom only when we. give

Another—Cod who has made Him-
self known in Jesus Christ."

Rev. Bartlett. who is one of the
country’s outstanding religious
leaders, explained that the funda—
mental urge to be free finds ex—
pression in many ways. He illus-
trated this by using examples from
literature and everyday life,

James Hilton’s “Lost Horizon”
appealed to the imagination be~
cause it transported the reader to
the freedom which was missed at
home. Alexander the Great was
said to have wept because there
were no more worlds to conquer,
yet he fell victim of his own ex—
cesses.

Thus, freedom must be won on
two fronts. Using Paul's words,
”All things are yours, and ye are
Christ's," Rev. Bartlett stated that
one follows his deepest nature to
belong to something or someone.
“What we belong to is in part our
choice to make. But to say, 'I am
Christ’s' is to set your feet upon
a road which leads to a remark—
able and indescribable freedom."

Rev, Bartlett was assisted by
Sally Robinson, Cleveland senior,
and James Millikan, Gates senior,
during the service. Lou Ann Al-
bright, town senior, was the so-
loist.

Olivet Group Raps
Administrative , Act

Displedsure Emphasized
By Refusal To Register

At Olivet college. Olivet, Mich,
62 students out of an expected
enrollment of about 300 are re-
fusing to register this fall. These
62 students have formed a Student
Action Committee and last week
picketed Olivet's administration
building.

BULLETIN
L. w. Snell, publicity director of
olivet college, reported by tele—
phone late this morning that the
strike has ended and all but 13
students have registered for clas-
ses. The two faculty members, he
said, were dismissed only altar
considerable debate by the college
board at trust/225. Boﬂl were given
is year's salary upon dismissal.

On Sept. 21, the newly formed
SAC issued a statement explain-
ing their action, telling of the facts
that led up to .the event.

In August, a member of the fac-
ulty for 12 years and his wife, a
librarian for six years. were "ar-
bitrarily dismissed." The college
has no tenure clause in its con-
tracts, and any member of the
faculty can be dismissed on short
notice. The students claim that the
administration has attempted to
control student activities in line
with this sort of action.

SAC demanded in the Sept. 21
statement that (I) the adminis—
tration permit an impartial edu—
cation agency to review the edu—
cational and administrative poli—
cies of the college. and (2) that
a retroactive tenure be considered,
and the faculty member and his
wife be reinstated.

The following day Dr. Aubrey
Ashby, president of alivet, called
a meeting of the SAC, faculty, and
administration. The college wished
the members of the SAC to regis-
ter on condition that they would
not picket without permission;
that they would not release any
statements to the press; and that
they would be on probation. .

A former statement from the
administration made no mention
of any conditions for the regis-
tration of these students.

At the conclusion of the state-
ment of conditions, John Vander-
‘iinll, chairman of the SAC, inquir-
ed about the nature of the Mich
gen Commission on College Ac-
creditation. Dr. Ashby compared
it to a "financial agency which
published confidential reports on
the financial stability of business
concerns throughout the country."
FLther investigation showed that
similar commissions had been on
the Olivet campus in previous
years.

A statement issued by SAC
Sept. 25 stated, “In view of the
breach of faith shown by the ad-
ministration at the faculty, SAC,
and administration meeting, in
their proposal that we NOW regis—
ter CONDITIJONALLY, the SAC
feels that we and the faculty have
been ‘double crossed.’ "

With this statement, the SAC
‘announced that it must continue
its demonstration and refuse to
register.
