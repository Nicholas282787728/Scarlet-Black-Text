~The Editors.

_ In 1787 the founders of our Constitu—
tioli wrote into that document the phrase
that this shall be a Republic form of go -
crliinent. Since the elltry of the Republi -
211i ildrtr into the political fracas, lepub-
lira s have adopted a partisan interpretar
tier; of the term “republican.” Every Pier
publican belie ‘es tllat the government shall
be of Republicai , by lepublicans, alld for
Republicans. Epecinlly intriguing to them
is the last phrase.

, Those of us who have had a course iil

Al ‘ean government, or who have learn-
ed to lead and interpret Webster’s diction-
ar , can easily understand that a republican
government is one which is representative,
of- le people it governs. This means no
more than it‘ say all groups within the
cool tr}? shall be participants ill the forma—
‘ticsi and execution of the laws and agencies
tli t have jurisdiction over them. Does this
inliilv that a federal system of govern-
1’ 2t shall be composed of a limited few
WI control the private economic interests
both ill the country and abroad? No, it
do s not.

Democracy, like tlle term republican. is

' terminolog for the representative—

; of gmerllment which our forefathers

his bed to bequeath to Us along with our

' _ of Cl il rights. It means a form

“ role uliicll permits each and every

v ip among- tlle ruled to speak for itself

c making of ruling powers.

Let us. then, ask ourselves the ones,

Dir lg‘ the yeai ol' the depression

\vlich came iiilder the Republican tenure,
the representation of groups within the
government hit a pitiful low. Farmers,
lobe 5, white collar workers, professional
pcirons alld small businessmen were all
bick . \Vith empty stomachs they hoped
for e: nomic guidaiice'to come from the ill-

diIStiiali t. But big business uas ailing,
too; so said the Republican owners. They
coiiitnl’t support the millions of Jobless and
homeless peoples who had voted their party
into power for so many years during the
reconstruction era.

The sufferers turned directly toward their
government for relief measures. But here,
too, they received no amelioration: the Re-
public n government uas too busy doling

passage of the Taft-Hartley act was the
culmination of this reaction to representav
tive government. Labor had met with a
blocking of any collective bargaining which
might have been possible under the New
Deal. The extension of the act into the
19—18 elections is evidellt' union funds, the-
only means labor can utilize in large, con~

from use in federal elections, Is this repres-

The Republican party has not changed
to this day. Dewey has shown his partiall-
ty toward industry and wealth in his stand
on the control of atomic power production.
Who shall control that which will benefit
the inaio 'ty? Certainly not the majority
nilder a Republican rule.

Unlike these selective poli ies, the his,
tory of the liberal actions of the Demo-
cratic party demonstrates the trend to fos-
ter a tl'llleEI'the system of government
wherein labor has equal rights of expression,
along uitli federal agencies and industry.
The NLRB is merely one instance of this
principle in action. Another is to be found
ill the president's insistence and persist-’
ellce ill civil rights.
