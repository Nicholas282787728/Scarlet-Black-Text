GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Pioneer Cagers Close Withl

Double Loss To Carleton

By George \Vullsohlucger ,
The Grinncll basketball teams
hopes of finishing the season
with a better than ,500 average
were effectively squelchrd this;
past Week in two games with
Carleton.

The Carls bumped the Pioneers
twice, once at Carleton Friday
night 49-42 and here Tuesday
night 5551. The two losses gave
Grinnell a five-won, elglit»lost
record in conference play and
plinnniented them into the loiver
regions of the league standings,

The game at Carleton was
close all the way with the Plane
eers hehind most of the time, In
the Vel‘y' last seconds of the‘
grant“ a disagreement broke out
over the time, _end the proceed-
ings were enlivened considerably.

In the game here the Pioneers
stormed into an immediate lead
and held it by a comfortable
margin until the half. They led
at one time by 14 points 2278.

in the second half or-inriell
suffered a complete reversal of
form, and the Carls came sweep-
ing to tie the score on Schlaf-
fer‘s basket 32—32. From then on
it was ding dong until Peterson
iced the ball game in the last
second with a setup.

Thurnhlad poured in 18 points
for Carleton and was ably abet-
ted by Peterson and Schlatrer
with 12 and 11. Peisner. looped
in 17 for the Pioneers,
