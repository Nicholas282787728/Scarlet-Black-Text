WI+hou+ Honor

It is hard to believe that the students
of Grinnell are not of the same timbre as
those of Stanford, Cornell, Florida, Prince-
ton, and many other colleges where the
honor system is as mucll a part of the
school as are the administration building
and the library. Yet Grinnellians evident-
ly are not. They find it impossible to trust
themselves 'and their friends sufficiently to
allow such a system to operate. We have
enough faith in both the students and the
honor system to want to give it another
try.

There are many schools in the coun-
try where it has had long and continu-
ous success. At the University of
Soutll Carolina the honor code has been
in operation for 125 years. At Stan~
ford it has enjoyed 27 years of unquali-
fied popularity In view of these and
other similar figures, another chance
for this great system is in order on
Grinnell’s campus.

Several changes and additions to the
operating rules of the former Grinnell
honor system might help it to function
more effectively. In view of the import-
ance of the honor court, its members should
be elected rather than appointed. The
pledge, which is aff ved to all exams, might
be e'panded to read, “I have neither given
nor received aid nor observed any unreport-
ed violations." Lastly, no one should be
allowed to serve on the honor collrt who has
been convicted of an Honor system viola-
tion. .

(loctrination of new students with the
spirit of honor. A new class of fresh-
men, fired with enthusiasm for the
honor system, will carry that approval
with it for the duration of its college
career. It will promote continuation
of the system, and each student will
benefit personally the rest'of his life.

A (letelmined effort by student leaders
and other interested persons could bring
about re-establishment of the honor sys-
telu at Grinnell, No student’s interest
could be directed toward a more vital cause.

Thc uninitiated may think
that Grinnell is a sophisticated

that more corn is prevalent on

This reclamation project
is of a magnitude beyond the
comprehension of the ordinary,
back yard farmer. This vast ex-
pause of land stretches ten
inches west to 20 inches south,
giving a total area of 200 square
inchcs of crops, namely radishes‘
and chives. I
The survey was extended to

include Charles Rafferty's carrot,
