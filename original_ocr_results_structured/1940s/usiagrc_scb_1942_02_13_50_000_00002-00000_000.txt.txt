0 Tribute.

The corridor between the library and ARH
has been transformed into a neat, blLlC‘VﬁZIllv
ed radio studio, which is scheduled to go on

tanglements, Colbert accomplished, almost
singlehanded, the difficult tasks of super
vising construction, buying equipment, mak
ing legal arrangements, and planning pro-
grams for the new project.

He even built wind and rain machines
and other sound equipment with the skill of
a master craftsman.

The radio studio opens up the field of

broadcasting to Grinnell students.

C Van Paassen Visits.

One of the most pleasing changes on the
campus this year has been the improvement
in the lecture course. To many of us, the
high spot on the calendar will be reached
next Monday evening.

Mr. Van Paassen comes to us with a
reputation that requires no enhancement.
His many y ‘ 's as foreign correspondent in
the main ts of strife throughout the
world have given him a peculiar insight ill-
to the movements and forces shaping the
world of today. Since he has witnessed the
triumphant rise of dictatorship the world
over, he is a most appropriate man to speak
on the subject “Democracy’s Last Stand,”

We anxiously await Mr. Van Paassen for
a still more important reason. No one who
reads Mr. Van Paassen’s books can [all
to be struck by his charm. Rising up from
the printed page comes the vision of a pow
el'ful and attractive personality. We wel—
come the opportunity of meeting this visioll

the air in March.

Tile studio was planned and constructed
under the efficient direction of Her
Colbert, assistant professor of journalism.

Fighting his way through priority en—

in the flesh.

Judging from the r
Leland Stowe last fall, we expect a capacity
audience Monday evening, Just a personal

Rawson Loses
Social Righis
Uni-ii Mar. 28

Aclion Taken
Following Violation
of Auiomobile Rule

All social privileges of Raw
son hall were suspended until
March 28, according to an an-
nouncement made this noon
by Shelton L Beatty, dean of
personnel.

The action followed the sus-
pension bf one of Rawswns house
officers for violation of the car
ruling, the announcement said.

Riding in the car with the sus-
pended student were eight other
Rawson residents.

Given the choice of losing their
social privileges for a time rath-
er than to have the other eight
men suspended for a brief period,
the house voted on the former, rc-
veal the other eight.

Tn the editor:

I want to express myself in some
way concerning the very fine con—
cert given Sunday afternoon by
the Grinnell collcgc band, so I
am writing this brief note to you.

I think Mr. Simmons and
every member 01 the ham] are
to be congratulated on the fine
performance of every number.
I was especially. impressed by
the clean playing of all the
pal-ts and the splendid intona-
ﬁon of the entire band.

To me the most pleasing num-
her was the Bridal Song from the
Rural Wedding Symphony of
Goldmark's. I have heard many
bands play this number, includ-
ing other college and university
bands, but I have never heard it
done better.

To those students who missed
the concert: be there for the next
one, for something really worth-
While is being done by this ener-
getic fellow and his musicians.
