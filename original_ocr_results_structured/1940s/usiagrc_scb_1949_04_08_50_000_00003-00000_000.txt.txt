Tony Pasfor Band Play Concerf

For Near-Capacn‘y
By Bob Pilkington

Tony Pastor brought his broth-
er and his brass and surprised
a good many Grinnellinns at his
concert here Wednesday night.
The 15—piece aggregation, aided,
abetted, and generally held ")7
gether by Tony's brother, Stub-
by, on trumpet and valve trom-
bone, showed many progressive
and bebop tendencies, as ex
hibited by its opening number,
Dizzy Gilespie’s “Anthropology.”

However, the almost-capacity
crowd. which right up to curtain
time had expected frayed novelr
ties oi the Pastor stamp such as
“Rambling Rose" and “One
Meatball," took the “new” music
enthusiastically. The semivpro-
gressive “Minor Bap" was well
received as were the suggestive
lyrics of ”Makin' Whoopee" and
“Let’s Fall in Love," although
the result of “HOW High The
Moon” _ was disappointing to
many of the jazz fans present.

The crystal-clear and hard hit-
ting trumpet oi Stubby. Pastor,
generally conceded to be the
mainspring oi the organization,
highlighted much of the even
ing with "1 Can’t Give You Any~
thing But Love," and “I Sur—
render Dear,” which was coupled
with valve trombone. ‘

Many will be interested to
learn that Stubby will pull out
of the band to form his own
Six-man combo in about three
weeks I

With her sister ill in the hOSr
pital, Rosemary Clooney did
more than her Vocal share with
numbers such as “’S Wonder-
ful." and “Bargain Day" as did
Buddy James on ”So I Love" and

ported by male sighs from the
audience and a retaliative mugv

in a reéorded interview over
KGRW last night, Tony reveal»

night stands in store for the
band. ending with two weeks in
New York's Paramount theater,

,1eases include “A , Adorable,”
“Bargain Day," with vocals by
