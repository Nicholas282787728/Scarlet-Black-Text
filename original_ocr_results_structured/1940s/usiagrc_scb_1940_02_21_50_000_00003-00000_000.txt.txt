Versailles Treaty
World’s Greatest

Says Hans Kalln

By William Buckley.

The Treaty of Versailles was the
greatest peace treaty in the his
lory of the world because it set
up the League of Nations, the
world‘s first attempt at collective
security, according to Dr. Hans
Kolin, professor of history at
Smith college, who gave the third
in ‘a series of eight contemporary
history lectures in Herrick chapel
last night, Dr. Kohn's address
was entitled “The First Trial of
Collective Security."

The League of Nations was pre-
destined to fail, according to the
Smith professor, for no nation
was able to gi sp the idea that
collective security means an en-
tirely new departure in inter
national relationships, and that
each nation has to think of itself
as an inter-connected unit in a
little world. “Man's mind was
not prepared for the League of
Nations," he said.

The blame for the failure oi
the League was also placed on
the United States by the history
lecturer.

The United States did not join
the League because of petty poll»
tical jealousies, Dr. Kohii asserted.
“The failure of the Senate to pass
the rblll can be blamed on un-
intelligent handling of it by Free
sident Wilson, and the egotism of
Senator Lodge," he claimed,

French Club Will Meet
