phase of work is the Stamp Metre
Machine through which the letters
are put to be stamped automati-

the necessity of dcpartmcntal se-

which the postage in this machine
is divided, is purchased in $100
bundles, or some 20,000 units at
a time.

The loss of your friendly faces we’re sure to grieve
But the armed forces demand our attendance
