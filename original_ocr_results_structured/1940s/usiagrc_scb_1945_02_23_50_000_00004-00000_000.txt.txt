Intramural

By Jean lueier and T“‘yli8.h
Hanistrcet ‘

ReadrMears Saturday afternoon
was a close game, 18714 at the
half, with Gerry Ross, calm and
deliberate, sinking four beauties
for Read from way back on the
iflool‘. Those of you who have
‘been following the games know
what we mean: Freddie Webb
played better for Read during
the second half, while Sapp play-
ed her usual smooth game
throughout. ‘Neat ball handling
showed Read to be a team that
was really going places. The three
forwards used some effective
screening plays that made their
score-mount up.

Wagner and Fagan, Mears, both
made some pretty shots, but the
Read guards proved themselves
lSLrong support for their forwards.
Mears seemed to lack a powerful
enough defensive, although they
put up strong resistance during
the first half. The final score
showed Read out in front 37723,

Gene Anna Hanzlik and Jo
Starrett directed the Meals band.
which included everything from
a washboard to a flute.
was really fine intramural spirit
shown among the ready Read
girls and the peppy preps.

In the Cleveland-Main game,
Sylvia Gerdes was the outstand.
ing player, making 11 of Cleve»
land's 25 points. Almost as out~
standing, but Without such strong
support, was Betty Sharp, who
accounted for Mam's total score
of 10 points, The Main forwards
found it tough sledding, especiaL
ly against Cleveland's MacMur-
ray. '

Main guards are to be credited
with a very great improvement
in the second half. Really, Main
played a much faster game than
the 25-10 score indicates. This
is all in the realm of conjecture,
we know, but we can’t help won»
dering where the score would
have stood if Mildred Miller had
been in there playing for Main.

professional manner.

Well, Haincs and Read niet
Wednesday and Haines went home
beaten, but not broken. The Read
locomotive sped smoothly down
the floor to the basket, and. may
we add, just as smoothly into it.

The forward trio, Ross, Sapp,
and Ross, Inc, monopolized the
ball to the extent of a as to 11
victory. Peg Tregillus and her
defensive company had a certain
magnetism for that ball, too. Yep,
we’re duly impressed,

Halne's one claim to fame now
lies in defeating Cleveland
and they'll certainly try. Which
reminds us, a game with thrills
and chills should be the Reade
Cleveland game next week.

planned to be missionaries, but
as the capital grew larger, the
regulations for loans were made
more liberal. Now the organiza-
tion gives scholarships on the
basis of high scholastic standing,
leadership, and need.

is about $16,000. Part of this
sum is in endowment funds, the
interest of which is available for
scholarships, Nominations arei
made by the scholarship commit-
tee, and precedence is given to
girls of senior standing who have
taken their complete courses
hcre and who are not residents
of Grinncll.

hold true for the ﬁrst ballot on-

This week busy exufficlal cal-mi
paign managers and their work-l
ei-s are painting posters, talking|
up their candidates, and predict-
ing for whom the cottages andi
halls will vote. With new predic~
tions and theories regarding stu-
dent opinion constantly changing.
it is hard to tell which candidates
remain on the top. However, the
four sure to clash are Jessie Tern—
berg. Gerry Warren, Mary Cas-
key, and Betty Montague, who
all seem strong candidates. But
any of the remaining seven could
easily swing the convention at
the last. minute.
