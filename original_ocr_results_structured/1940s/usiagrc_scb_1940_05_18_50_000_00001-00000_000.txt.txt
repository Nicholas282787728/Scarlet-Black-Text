GRINNELL
SCARLET AND BLACK

VOLUME XLVII

If You’re Speaking of Food-

RQLLS. COFFEE ARE FAVORITES

---Among Crinnell Student Body

By Clyde Bales.
Like the caissons of the famed ar-
tillery song, Crinnell students lite
erally “go rolling along." Tooth-
some hot rolls, capped by yellow
slabs of melting butter and sever-
al crusty pecans, framed in the
steam of a cup of Javamtnls pic»
ture will be remembered with de-
light by Grinnelllans when memo—
ries of ivy—covered towers, elm—
shaded streets and other tradi-
tional academic scenes have
slipped into the limbo of oblivion.
However, the roll situation at
Grinnell is more than romantic;
it runs into big business figures.
From information obtained from
three of the most frequented “hot
roll” spots hereahouts, it has been
calculated that the men and 004

cos of this institution spend
$233,280 for coffee and rolls dur-
ing a ten years' period of time.
This entails some 1,166,400 rolls
and 291,600 gallons of coffee,
enough java (cream included) to
on ten tank cars. If these rolls
were put and to end they would
reach from here to Des Mamas
and back again.

Furthermore it would take one
Grinnell student, consuming rolls
at the polite rate of one every
five minutes, 97,000 hours, 8,100
days, or 22 roll-filled years to
gnaw his way through this moun-
tainous mass of pastry.

“The White Spot," "Dixie” and
“Candyland,” three most popular
roll emporiums, sell an aggregate
of 36 dozen, 432 rolls, each day.

Oldest College Newspaper West of the Mississippi River
GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, VIAY 18, 1940

NUMBER 56

Calculating one cup of java for
each roll, this would amount to
108 gallons of coffee a day. At
a nickel a throw and another
five cents for coffee, simple
arithmetic shows that students
spend $86.40 per day for coffee
and rolls. For the nine months‘
school year this amounts to well
over a hundred thousand rolls
and approximately 30,000 gallons
of coffee, which cost $23,328 per
year.

By this devious route the mag—
nificent proportions of the roll in.
dustry at Grinnell becomes ap-
parent. Detroit has its Ford in-
dustry; Grand Rapids has its for-
niture. but Grinnell students must

eat their way to financial fame,

Purge; Why?Men
In Vast Minority

By jo Smilli.

The Esscnbee has been plastered
(or should that word he used?)
with the attitudes of the men on
the recent Purge but not a word
has come from the women. The
time has come when we women
should put in our two-bits and
hope we don‘t get condemned.

It is the consensus in the Quad~
rangle that the wrong time of
year was picked to quietly toss
out members of the male group.
This is spring, y'know, and we
didn't intend to come to a girl’s
college,

oiic lovely freshman
when q‘itestlollcd, declarcd- “It's
a lot of nonsenseiwe are old
enough to know what we are do-
lng."

The opinion of an upper-
elass girl was: “$”—-&!l"’.”

Well, there you have lt—take it
or leave it. At least we tried.
