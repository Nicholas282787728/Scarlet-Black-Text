part called for intensity and
depth and she provided hoth in
adequate amounts.

She neither overplayed, which
would be easy to do in such a
characterization, nor played down
her role but hit the middle for a
“right" performance.

Named Pathetic.

Katherine Mills was excellent in
her portrayal, of the crochety
Mrs. Bramson, an imaginary in—
valid who is completely won over
by the charming “Danny."

This portrayal, too, was very
well done. She was at once ir"
tatiiig and pathetic, for the au
ence guessed that she was to be-
come the next victim of her fa»
vorite.

Maids Provide Humor

Marilyn McCool and Elizabeth
Bcck, the two slovenly maids,
provided a touch of humor which
relieved the high pressure tension
created by to rest of the play.

Hubcrt Laurie, the inoffensive
but hopelessly boring neighbor,
was played with feeling and sym—
pathy by Orin Wallick.

Robert Judd was very good as
the inspector, and Nurse Libby
was adequately portrayed by Vlrr
ginia Geiger.

Not part of the play proper, but
nevertheless important was John
Theobald, the Lord Chiel Justice,
who reviews the case in the pro-
logue. He was convincing in the
part.

To Joseph Beckcr and his ercw
should go the credit for the ap—
propriate background for the pro~
duction, the set which helped cre—
ate the mood of horror, and the
effective lighting.
