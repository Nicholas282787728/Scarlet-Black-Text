lie-appearance of thc Smltlll

owl and the Dibble eagle, and pre-
inior of an original I’OnIEHUCi
ballad, were the high points of
itawson hzill's ncruc of 1947,‘
presented last Friday evcning [0‘
u capacity audience in thc hignl
school auditorium. l

Written and directed by fresh-
man Andy Sciiill, the musical
- comedy was produced by the Kel-l
ly Stables men entirely on Lhﬁlr:
DWI) time, and can be called the
finest single-hall function soon
so 1211- this year. its story traced
the agonies suncreii by u
“Gl'uanell” trcshman from the
time of his awakening to the
facts of college hfo, to his even-
tual acceptance as a Ruwson man.

Strongest features of the
rough-and-ready crossrsection of
campus 1112, were the accurate
characterizations of the principal
roles, and the original lyrics and
whole-hearted execution of the
songs.

Leading part, that of Hershcld
Whimpietree, bewildered prep,,
was played by c. Morton Cliff,
freshman. He was wen supported
In his introduction to Groanell
by Harvey Sanford, sophomore,
as Dean Smiley; Ed Kallish,
sophomore, as Professor Ryan;
and Jack Hebbeln, senior,~ as
Professor Freddie.

Brunt of the singing was car-
ried by Georgc Mally, sophomore;
Jim Hammond, junior; and Mel
White, freshman, acting as them-
selves, who were artistically per-
fect as a trio, rendering "I‘m
a Senior From old Rawson Hall",
and "This Is Gl'oanell", bcsldes

, assisting in other numbers.

Bill Kellenberger, freshman,
sang his own composition, "The
Moon and You and Me", aided
by Hammond, Sanford, and Scott
MacEachron as a chorus. In an-
other solo, c. Morton Cliff medi-
tated on “The Woes of Us Fresh-
men", ‘

The 12»man Kelly chorus, after
its lighthearted opening dance,
sang the backgrounds for Max
Bacon, sophomore, and Dick
Hurt, freshman, in “In Ryan's
Speech Class"; and for Sanford
and Hammond, in “She Had To
Go and Lose It At The Stables",
the finale.

It was during the latter mim-
ber that Bob Peshel, freshman,
executed a tap dance, and the
Dibble and Smith hall trophies
ended their months-long absence
from campus life.

Bill Springer, town freshman,
and Fay Dykman, James sophor
more, arranged the music for
Kelly band, and Jack Hebbeln.
senior, Oharlcs Rafferty, Jack
Milroy, and Ken Kitterman,
sophomores, acted as production
