”'5 Here Again - -

Many generations of Grinnellialis have
heard of the Honor System, they have
heard of it in private discussion groups
and in debates, they have heard of it from
transfer students and from members of the
faculty. The difficulty lies ill the fact that
Grinnell has only heard of the Honor Sys-
tem, never have they had a chance .to try
it out, except for a few notable cases where
individual instructors have worked on the
assumption that Grinnell students are old
enough and mature enough to shoulder the
responsibility of looking after their own
moral standards.

Now, when we have a small, ccmpara~
tively unified student body, is the time to
give the Honor System an honest and
Searching trial. (That the majority of the
studnt-body wants an Honor System has
been proved by vote after vote. That the
majority of the student—body are ready

to get solidly behind the system proposed,

is also a fact. It is true that many of us
are willing to accept and actively support
. the spi it of the Honor S teill, which i
so fitted to tll greater Gilnllcll Spirit, hilt
. still find it fli lclllt to accept all the minor
details oi the plan presented.

system that is backed by [ear and force.
Tll group has a sound argument but a
fogg understanding of the puipose of the
110nm System. is it fear that keeps you
from cheating? Isn't it rather, a dcslie to
do the best work of which you are capable
and to do it on your oilil two leet that
keeps you from cheating? As long as we
look after ourselves, and we kllow that we
are able to look after ourselves, why must
we fear a student system of control mole
than no fear a faculty system of control?
No one who is straight \ th himself Vllll
need have Lhe slightest fear, no matter
hon severe the penalties. Grinnell creates
a positive and constructive attitude tel ard
work, J‘r ndship and lile. The Honor Sy
tem cleates a positive attitude toward
honesty.

The Honor System, as presented, makes
sufficient provision for leniency toward
those few individuals who under the strain
of tenuous circumstances, fall by the way-
side. Grinnell is interested ill helping such
people. The Honor System, as presented,
is tough on cheaters; Grillnell is doing-
them no’service and they are not adding
to Grinnell, they are the ones who have
reason to fear the Honor System.

This is ollr chance to prove that the
duration government of Grinnell has a 1' al
backbone and a real heart for the best in-
terest of Grinnell. This is the time to back
the Honor System to the hilt; this is the
time to test it; after it has had a fair trial
is the time to Judge it. Just such an honor
system has been ill successful operation at
Princeton University since 1893; is Grin—
llell so different or so backward that it
cannot agree on such fundamental issues
as honesty, fail-play and cooperation?

Address by Ruth
Haines Given to

Miss Ruth Haines, representative
of the National Y. w. c. A.
and a field organizer and di-
rector for the U. s. 0. was pres-
ent on Grinnell campus Satur-
day, April 22. She addressed the
‘1. w. c. A. Cabinet at their
regular Saturday meeting.

At this meeting Miss Haines,
under the auspices of the Y. w.
c. A. gave suggestions to the
Grinnell Y. cabinet concerning
raising money. new social cc—
tiviies, and new social service
pmjecls the y could undemkc
for the coming school year.

Miss Haines is Lhe grand-
daughter of Joanna Haines, one
of the first graduates of Grin-
nell College, for whom Haines
Cottage was named.

Woodrow Wilson. Ma- ‘

. Chiang Kai»Shek are among those!
scheduled for the rest of the se-
lnester.

Due to the decrease in the stu-
dent body, the seminar 7 usually
restricted to senior majors in his
l toi'y 7 has been opened to all up
lperclass students interested in the
subject.

Students enrolled in the seminal
are Louise Buchanan, Betty Camp
Catherine Funk, Richard Funk
lJack Hartley, Patricia Knop, Pa.
‘Lricia Milnor, Doris Popple, Nah
Pye, Lois Star-her, Janna. Smith
‘Teu Sannlford, David Sparks, and
Sally Weed,

Reports are based on indivldiir

al research by a smgle student
who presents an hour lecture. A
period of general questions and
[discussion follows the reading oi
the paper.
l Leaders of the seminar have
emphamzed that selection of par
ticular mch rather than subject:
does not indicate a subscription
to the ‘Men Make History' school
of thought, Rather, the personages
in discussion are presented in the
context of their period, and an
attempt is made to show the m
fluence cf exterior events upon
the man, as well as his effects
upon the times.

“This is not a course in biograr
phy." Mr. Baumann stated. Per-
sonal details of the subjects are
considered of interest, but not
necessarily of importance.

Meetings are held every other
Monday in the home of one of
the professors.
