GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Sideline Speculations and
Intramural Indications

By Jean Kiefer and ’hvyliaji

Hmnstreet.

Now that the basketball season
is underway, let's take a look at
the teams that are in the run-
ning. Among the freshman cot-
tages. Cleveland seems to be out—
standing, with its Holmes, Gerdes,
Watt trio of forwards Tlie guards
play a smooth game, but Baleys
sprained ankle may put a kink
in that. Cleveland has a little
extra something that counts for
plenty when a team gets tired,
That's the spirit of the cottage,
shown in the way, they respond to
creerleaders Nell Bagan and viv
Ci-ocioni.

While Mears does not seem to

have such a consistently depend-i

able team, it must be remembered
that both Fagan and Rusty Brunr
nor were out of town over last
weekend. Jean Phillips, Bunny
naines and “Twinkle" Watts did
very well for
night, and with the added sup~
port of the two absent players,
Mears may prove ‘to be a pretty
powerful team.

Haines centered its team around
Beenle Horr. who. although she
Wasn’t hitting the basket so well
Friday night, played her usual
smooth game against James Satv
urday. Nancy Young, Betty Fritz,
and Marge starrett are a guard
trio that should be able to help
names a lot in the two stiff
games—Cleveland and
that are coming up.

Nemmers and Crowl outplayed‘

themselves for James last week

end, but even supported by Osler,

and Butler-s usual essy playing.
and not to be omitted, the val-
iant efforts of “Burpie” and
”Okie” as waterboys and the
peppy James band, it doesn’t look
like a championship team.

themselves Friday i

Bedd~ ‘

The Read-Main game was
lprctty much of a slaughter, but
1W6 have to give Main Credit for
trying. Mary Ellen McKay was
,oiitstaiiding for Main, and the
lRead team was outstanding for
Read. That is not as funny as
it sounds. The Read cellar play-
ers worked together on Mears
lchampionship team last year, and
lhave carried their fine teamwork
over to their new cottage Add to
this players like Supp, Gerry Ross,
Tei-iiberg and what do you have?
Need we say more?

standings so for show Cleve-
land on top with four points. or
two wins, Haines comes next with
three points, a win and a tie.
Read is in third place with two
points, but remember they have
played only one game. James is
in fourth place with one point,
lindicating a tied score, and Main
and Mears have no score as
,yet.

i The enthusiastic backing given
Mears by head during the Mears»
,Hnines game, and the equally en-
;thusiastic backing given James by
Read in the James-Haines game
seems to indicate not a prerMears
or pro-James, but rather, an anti»
Haines spirit among the Read
‘hell girls.

So we suggest that the biggest
lthriller of the tournament should
be the Read-Homes game. It should
even be the championship-determ-
ining game. Watch it!

League Discusses
Poliﬁcs of Coun’ry

In a Jmnl meeting on Monday
night. the town and college
League of Women Voters heard
Mrs. C. L. McNally and Mrs.
lvan Brooks of the town league
discuss the politics of Poweshiek
county. Among other subjects
the tax system. county relief,
and the schools of the county
were explained,

Mrs. McNally said that Pow-e
eshiek county was organized in
18423 and now has a population
of 18,000. The county is divid-
ed into three parts, each of which
is under one of the three county
Supervisors, Three supervisors
are elected. one each year, and
serve for three years. The kinds
and amounts of county assistance
to the old, blind, needy. and de-
pendent children werc reported
by Mrs. Brooks.

Attendance at the second lee-
ture of Dr. C. J. Friedrich next
Monday evening in Herrick Chap-
be substituted for the
regular meetings of both the
town and college leagues. Dr.
Friedrich's subject at that time
will be "Dumbarton Oaks”

Philosophy Seminar.
Dramaﬁzes Faus’r

The first scene of Goethe's Faust
was dramatized by various mem-
bers of the philosophy seminar
Tuesday night, and was then
thoroughly discussed in an at-
tempt to understand the philoso—
phy behind the work,

0f greatest interest to most
members was the fact that Goe—
the does not believe that there
can be either love or laughter
in Heaven.

Main discussion of the evening
centered around the question
that was raised, if God is omni-
potent why doesn’t he abolish
evil in the world? Dr. Seekel
pointed out that if this were the
case. freedom of will would be
destroyed and man could not
prove himself good because there
would be no evil against which
the standards defining good
might be established.

Baffle Board Enjoys Dinner

Valentine's Day was the theme

girls were served a special tur-
key dinner, after which they at-
tended “Maisie Goes To Reno"
at the Iowa theatre.
