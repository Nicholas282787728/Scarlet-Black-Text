Cloyed With Culture - —

We just love culture. There is nothing
like it, we always say to ourself in our more
confidential moments, and there is nowhere
like Grinnell to get it. Yet even our most
esthetic self cringed in screaming horror
when we read the latest edition of the so,
called social calendar. ,

Maybe we have a stereotype of socia
life. When we envisage it, there ﬂoats
before us technicolor visions of dances and
sleigh-rides and carnivalsglaughlng good
times that offer some relaxation from the
Weekly routine. Yet the current social
calendar lists, through November 18, no
such event.

Oh, it starts out with a bangg‘Satulu
day, November 3—Fall Formal Dance.”
Having reached this great height of hilarv
ity, it seems to feel that it has done its

duty, [or it settles back with a self-satisfied
smirk and proceeds to list for the next two
weeks only concerts, recitals, lectures, rcr
hearsals, and meetings. Unless some
change is made in the social setup of the
college, there is little or no prospect of a
more stimulating list of events for the next
two weeks, or the next.

That there is need for a change is, we
believe, evident. A social calendar should
offer some kind of balance between edu-
cation and recreation. Because too much
has been piled on a few groups and in-
dividuals in the social planning, because the
social chairman has been called upon to do
more than any social chairman in previous
years, because the calendar is so inflexable
as to admit no changes even when the vets
wanted to give a dance, there is no balance
whatsoever.

Revival of the defunct Gadabouts seelns'
to the Scarlet and Black to be the answer
to the problem. Gadabouts was a social or-
ganization which all students could join by
the purchase of a ticket for $2 a semester.
This entitled the student to admission to
all Gildabout events. The two student
heads, a manager and assistant manager,
were salaried and had the entire l'espone
sibility for planning decorating, and hand-
ling any other details for rill social events.
With responsibility thus concentrated, there
was no passing of the buck or working at
cross-purposes. The student heads knew
what type of entertainment was wanted by1
the college. Working independently of ad-
ministration supervision, accountable only‘
to the Student Council, they tried to pro»
vidc for the student body week-end enter-
tainment of varied types.

Gadabouts collapsed under a feminine
avalanche a year and a half ago when the
departure of the ASTP made “social life" a
thing of the past. Now, as the men return
in increasing numbers, there is a growing
need for a varied and well~pianned social
program that will pull Grinnell out of its
war doldrums. We submit the re-estab-
lishment of Gadabouts under the super-
vision of the Student Council as the solution
to the social calendar blues

All this big- festivity, namely
