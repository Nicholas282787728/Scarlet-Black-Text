Volleyball Loop;
Clark Moves Up

Intramural volleyball swung in-
to its second week of competition,
with each of the mcn's halls dis-
playing fine sportsmanship and
an eagerness to send their respec-
tive teams to the top of the
league. Mid-sems and an influx
of influenza shots failed to lower
the calibre of play, as the men
went all out in an attempt to
secure the necessary victories to
individual six man
teams in the running for the
trophy. .

All games scheduled for last
Tuesday evening were cancelled.
due to the use of Darby gym for
medical purposes, and will be
played at a later date. However,
competition was resumed Wednes-
day night at the expense of both
Smith hall and the Cowles aggre-
gate. Dibble. showing good team
cooperation, won a double head—
cr from Smith and took over un-
disputed possession of first place
in the league with four wins and
no losses. Clark’s a and )3 teams
outpointed the Cowlcs represen»
tatives in a duo—victory. \

Thursday evening Langan and
Dibble split a two match series
and Rnwson won two matches
from Gates.

BARTLING

 

“Hatless” Ben Douglas, the
Pioneer's head football mentor, is
a firm advocate of, more and bet-
ter home games during the sea-
sons to follow. This is easily un-
derstandable. as the men of the
Scarlet and Black displayed their
most potent offensive and defens-
ive abilities while performing be-
fore spectators on Word field.
However, Bcn, reminiscing on the
gridiron contest of '46,

praise for his men, both in the
home games and those played on
foreign fields.

The Pioneers opened their sea-
son against Central, defeating
the Dutchmen s to o, in is hard
fought battle on Ward field,
and the prospects looked good
l for the Crinncllians. The fol- l

lowing week conch Douglas

took his boys to Knox for a
_conlerenco game.

And the prospects cast gloomy‘
shadows on the scoreboard - sha-
dows ot unpleasant happenings to
take place during the next few
games. The Knox gridders over-
whelmed the Pioneers 13 to 9.
and Douglas returned with his
men to prepare for the next
Week's game with Monmouth, a
contest ending in a deficit for
the‘ Grinnellians to the tune of
12 to 7.

The Centennial homecoming
game with Lawrence added to the‘
list of Pioneer defeats, the Vik»
ingsloverpowering the home team
21 to 13. And then the PioneersI
took the signal from Coach Doug-
las, and with the assistance of a re-
vised lineup, marched for six
touchdowns ,the next two
games.

The Con college gridmen bore
the brunt of a powerful ground
attack, and the pioneers tore
into them with a vengeance,
defeating them 28 to a, before
the home fans.

The following Saturday the Pi<
oneer aggregation continued their
conference wins with a victory
over Carleton, 13 to 2, and then

Injuries for the men of the

(Lefty) Sory and Orv Burns were

the Pioneers gave a good account
