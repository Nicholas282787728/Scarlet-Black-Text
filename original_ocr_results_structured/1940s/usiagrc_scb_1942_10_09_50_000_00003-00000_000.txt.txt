Prepping-~-

Continued from page 1

Honor "G”
H. , agreed this afternoon
(Thursday) that disciplinary
prepping of hall members he car-

iations, and C. Of

The entire question of auth-
ority for prepping is a new
one to Grinnell campus. Miu-
tes of the council of House
Presidents meetings since 1937
make no mention of such ac-
tivities. Last year, a point
system whereby preps were al-
lowed to shorten their period
of “education" by special
duties and good behavior, was
initiated by the Honor “’G,
headed by Gerald Grant. Ap~
parently. the authorization for
such a program was not ques-
tioned. .

Freshman men were also liv-
ing in a special hall, Langan,
last year, with two Honor "G"
men as senior residents. This
year no Honor "G" man is l'nr
cluded as a senior resident in
Read.

 

 

ried out by hall officers and no
other body.

"In regard to ordinary prepping,
such as buttoning on campus,
Honor “G” will be entitled to
the same consideration as any
upperclassmen.”

McCurdy's election has not
been confirmed finally since he
is also publicity chairman of the
central committee of the council.
Action will be taken on the ques»

”When 1 ask inch in the ser-
vice what they’re fighting for,
they say freedom, but they do
not know what freedom!” the
speaker revealed.

“Freedom of the individual to
live by the highest justice, highe
est honesty, and highest service
for the good of all men,” is the
type of freedom proposed at the
nation’s goal by Dr. Biirkhart.

1f the situation remains the
same and the purpose is not ac-
complished this time, the fighting
men who return after the war
will not be willing to stand up
or fight for that purpose again.
Rather they will accept the
tyranny which they are trying to
overcome, Burkhart prophesied.

Discussions on marriage prob
lems were led by Burkhart in
Cleveland pallor immediately af—

ter the chapel period and after
lunch.

 

Breezy Zephyr—

Biows In
——O‘c+ober 24

Don’t stop that rumor; it's all
true: Zephyr will once again be
breezing across the campus,
spreading sunshine, happiness,
and a few wicked darts in its
wake.

The first issue ot Gi-iniiell's
most popular humor magazine
will be out October 24th, John
Kendrick, editor of the publicar
tion, announced last night

Though rationing has effected
almost everything else, Zephyr
will throw paper to the winds
and issue a double number, com-
bining the best featurcs of Home-
coming and the National Emer—
gency 0n the campus.

Special added features will in-
clude a complete pagerlengm
novel. more horrifying than the
Hound of the Baskervillcs, a con~
fession ripped from the intimate
diary of a campus leader, and a
truthful expose of Grinnell’s ade
aptation to war-time living.

“A limited number of copies,
approximately 500, will' be avail-
able for anitioiis Grinnell stu—
dents.” Kendrick concluded. "To
make sure of yours, subscribe
now: Zephyr agents will solicit
in each hall and cottage within
a few days.

All contributions must be in by
Sunday night.

Thursday, and from 2:30 to 4:45
p. m, except Saturday.

In cooperation with the hem
of religion. the bookstore man-
agement has agreed to remain
closed during the Thursday mor-
ning chapel period, beginning at
9:40.

If chapel is dismissed by 10:25,
however, the bookstore will re-
open uiilil 10:35, Help added.

Saturday closing hour is four
o'clock,

Morning mail is distributed by
3:30 a. in., and students can on-
ter the bookstore at this time.

"This hour of opening was ar-
ranged in the hope that the stu-
dents would collect thcir mad be-
fore classes, thus eliminating the
mid-morning rush. Thus far, they
have not taken advantage of it,
but it will eliminate service difr
ficulties it they will do so. Every-
one can get their mail before
chapel on Thursday it they wish."

Sixtyrthl’ce man-hours are now
used each week in the bookstore,
but this includes time used in
putting out mail, orde~'ng and
unpacking books, and doing- booke
keeping during periods when the
store is not open for business.

Salary of bookstore employees
is set by the collegc, but is paid
out of store profits. If these prof-
its do iiot cover the salaries stip-
ulated, employees must take a
cut, Kolp Said.

Excess profits go into the stu-
dent dividends declared each
spring, and $400 ycarly rent for
the store is paid to the college.
