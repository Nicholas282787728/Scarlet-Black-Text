Praise For Preps

l Those of us who were on the Grinnell
campus during- tlle war years were amazed
and pleased at the size of this year’s l'res!
man class. Now, after a semester of living,
working, and playing with them, we are
ready, eveil eager, to 'accept them as fullv
fledged Griuuellialls. The class of '50 has
shown itself to be something quite ollt of
the ordinaly not only in sizebut in spirit
and ability as well. Not for a long time has
a group with such a fund of pep and orgiii-
ality taken over the college.

The freshmen affairs during New Stu-
dent Days in September were all success-
ful Since then the “preps" have sponsored
in class dinners and parties than the
junior and Sellior classes put together.
second-semester highlight was the Winter
Carnival, another all freshmen party.

As a consequence of this Will my; toe
gether the freshmen have become united as
a class and thlls achieved the goal toward
which the rest of the student bdoy has been
struggling for three years Class unity IS
a‘ good start in the direction of school
spirit, and the llpperclassmen who have
been gaping about lack of spilit should
take this into consideration.

It seems that We would all do well to
emulate the freshmen. ll" tlle rest of us
are just too old and worn out to do so, let
us at least realize and appreciate the con-
tribution which has been made by the
newest members 01' the Grinnell Fellow—

Hot House Education

For the past few weeks a subvcr 're lace
tion in the college maintenance department
has been playing havoc with the persistent
attempts of students to study in the Li-
brary. ‘

The inconsistent and unreasonable weath-
er we've experienced during the past weeks
has revealed clearly the general outlines of
this group’s obstrllctionist tactics. Few
revolutionary programs anywhere ill the
world have ever possessed such diabolical
subtlety or such insidious malig'lii The
plot does not have the grandiose nihilistlc
objectives that were manifested by the
communist, nazi, and fascist revolutions.
but within its small theater—Grinnell col—
legeaits triumph would mean the complete
overthrow of liberal education as \\e now

aware of the insidious plot working against

Then the plot began to unfold. In the}

Let all students take warning of the
