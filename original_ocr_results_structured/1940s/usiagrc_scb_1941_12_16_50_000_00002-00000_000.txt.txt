beaten in the last six or seven years.

If such be the case, it is Lime the professors were taken
off their higlrhorse, and we think the volleyball intlamural

O War and Health.

Several sane and sensible steps have been taken by college
officials to safeguard against any influenza epidemic similar
to the one that struck Grinnell last year: The precautions are
especially Well»timed in light of the “flu" epidemic which
struck the nation following the World War I.

The first move will be to give all students physical exam—
inations following their return to Grinnell after the Christ-
mas holidays.

The second step is to make all students visiting friends
at the hospital first obtain a permit from hospital authori-
ties. Prior to getting the permit they are advised to see
Miss Swan, college nurse.

Statistics last year show that one coed, returning from
vacation with a mild case of influenza, spread the disease to
17 members of her cottage

Nollen Asks--”Whal Price Christmas?"

The eternal message or the N217
tivity is poems and good will. But
this Christmas downs on a World
rent asunder by wor and hatred
and treachery. For the second
time in a generation, we see the
demons of destruction let loose on
a. scale ncvcr before known in
history, as if our boosted civiliza—
tion were only it thin vcncer over
the most brutal savagcry and the
most acquiSitive grccd. Actually,
the seeds of the present conflict
were sown by the leaders of the
victorious nations after Lhc first
World War, for instead of peace
they made only an uneasy armisA
ticc, since they were inspired by
hatred and revenge rather than
by good—will.

The terrible danger in the war
now unleashed is not the posh
bility of defeat for us and our
allies We have the power and de—
termination to win through in the
end. The worst peril confronting
us is the probability of snothcr
“peace” dictatsd by hatred and
revenge If that comes, then our
heavy sacrifices will be Vain ins
deed.

mics,” That is not an cosy way.

smrharclened world. But it is the
only way if the world is to be
saved. Hate in sin. but save the
sinner—that h s always been the
Christian way, It is also the only
reasonable way. in the present in<
stance, the Japanese lcadsrship is
reckless and criminal in its in—
snne ambition. But the people of
Japan are themselves the most
tragic sufferers from such leader-

ship. They deserve our sympathy
rather than our hatred.

The Christian Way is not an
easy way,‘but it is the prcvcn
way to salvation. It demands the
sacrifice of many a pagan passion
and ambition, a recognition of
eternal values. That is the price
of Christmas.
