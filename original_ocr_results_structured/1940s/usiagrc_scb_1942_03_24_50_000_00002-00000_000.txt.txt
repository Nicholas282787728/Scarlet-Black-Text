O No Brickbats.

Will the administration please step forward
and take a bow?

They are to be congratulated on the sane,
sensible attitude that is being taken in
their relationships with the student body.

First, where is tlle annual “purge?” It
has either failed to materialize or is way
behind schedule. ‘

Second, an extra half day for spring
vacation, a move which required consid»
erable Shifting of class schedules, has
been granted the student body.

Third, the social committee made a
magnallimous decision yesterday when
they allowed the Gadabouts to stage a
dance with a “name" band on a Friday
night.

Nerves are on edge and tempers short this

semester. Social restrictions would only re,
sult ill hell r ising, bringing with it an anti»
Gl'innell feeling:

So long as the administration continues
to respect the wants and wishes of the stur
dent body, then, by the same token, the
student body has a duty to respect the
wants and wishes of the administration,

0 Grading System.

The status of the grade “H", or Honors,
should be clarified.

Should it correspond to the “A" in the
standard grading system, or is it something
Special, a mark signifying a spark of gen-
ills?

Some professors give many "H‘s". It
means the student has done perfect work,
wihch calls for a lot of study and applica—
tion, but not always brilliance.

The other type of professor will give an
”H” only to thewery exceptional student,
and ii' there is no such student, he will give
no one the grade.

11' we are to continue in this grading sys-
tem, it should be made uniform.

O War Loss.

Not that it means anything to you, reader,
but war is playing havoc with the Scarlet
and Black.

When the new printing contract is sign—
ed sometime ill April, costs may soar to the
point where the paper will be reduced to a
weekly publication.

But that is nothing compared to losing
Louie, for Louie Matteson, make-up man
for the Scarlet and Black for the past seven
years, is about to ’oin the army.

A man with int lite patience, Louie takes
green collegiate journalists in hand, shows
them the mysteries of the print shop, then
turns them out in the world as green news—
papermell—but no longer college j ournalists.

In reality, Louie is the one cohesive force
connected with the Scarlet and Black.

We wish him the best of luck in the

army.

Four speeches have been giv-
en this week by the two mid-

University of Nebraska, and Dr.

of the ﬁrst Unitarian Society of
Minneapolis.

Talk Simduy Morning.

At the regular college church
service Sunday morning. March
22, Dr. Patterson opened the ses-
sion with the topic, “Beliefs thct
Matter Most." He emphasized in
his speech the fact that because
human beings do not understand
God, prayer, or eternal life is no
reason to deny them.

"Today the human race needs
power, and the best method for
deriving that power is internally
through personal religion,” Dr.
Bragg stated. Using Paul and
Isaiah as examples, he stressed
the importance of religion as a
source of power to accomplish
worldly tasks.

Discussion in Evening.

An informal discussion in thc
Associations building lounge Sun-
day evening, replacing the i-cgu-
lar college Fellowship meeting,
was lead by Dr. Bragg. His sub-
ject was, “What We Live By."

needs are gathered up in one

Discussing the “opposition" of
science and religion, Dr, Bragg
had o Special meeting for all stu-
dents of natural science yesterday
at nine 3.. m, in the Associations
building.

“Religion in relation to the cre-
ction of the world should not

No Examination
For Conditioning
Says Truesdale

The ultimate of ultimates pierced
the muscle bound brains of Grin-
no]! men participating in the gov—
cmment conditioning program me-
cently when rumors began Cir»
culating about the campus that
final examinations were necessary
for completion of the body build-
ing course.

Such things as, climbing a 20
foot rope in 18 seconds without
the use of the legs, doing so
pushups without even stopping
for at least two seconds for every
those accomplished, running 10
laps of the gym ﬂoor without a
let-up between every two for a.
cake and a smoke, and other such
arduous tasks have been consider-
ed as part of the final examina—
tions for gmductiion from use
program, according to rumors.

However, John C. Truesdalc
came through today with the
statement that all rumors of this
type should be considered false,
and should be considered vicious
propaganda designed to lower
the morale of the student body
as a whole,
