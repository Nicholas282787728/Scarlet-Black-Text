2 Home Tennis
Meets Slated

Pioneers to Tackle

Cornell Next Friday;
Meet Coe Saturday

Coach Oliver Wagner's Grinneu
tennis squad races two conference
foes in home meets this weekend,
playing Cornell on Friday, ands
Coe Saturday. These will be the
first two Pioneer Mid-West con—
ference matches this season.

Friday's opponent, Cornell,
dropped a match to Duhuoue uni~
versity last week in their sea-
son opener, but should present an
improved lineup against Crinnell.

Although both Cornell and cos
have been defeated in team
matches this spring, they both
will bring an outstanding top—
ranking singles player. Cornell's
number one man scored the
only singles victory for his team
in their recent match with
Duhuque.

On Saturday, Coo will also bring
an outstanding singles player in
Les McAllister, who holds vies
tories over the Iowa State and
State Teachers number one men
this season. McAllister scored the
ony Coe single victory when his
team lost to Iowa State Saturday.
Wagner said that he expects the
match between sterling Lord and
McAllister to he one of the {most
evcr played here.

Coach \Vngner plans a. change
in iinciip tor the Pioneers this
week. Captain Ccne Feisner, who
scored 3 singles victory in the
Iowa State mect last week, will
he moved up to the number two
position, Peisner will probably
play doubles in matches this week
with Ed Gilbert.

Cornell will bring ﬁve players
here on Friday for the match
which is scheduled to start at
2:00 on the quadrangle courts.
The Coe match on Saturday is
tentativly scheduled for 2:30,
Wavner stated.
