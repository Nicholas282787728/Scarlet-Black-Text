Boosting Our Radio’ Show - —

For some time stlldents have been coms
plaining about the quality of the Grinnell
College Radio Party, One of the favorite
laments of tlle students is that the program
doesn‘t devote enough time to giving a
truly representative picture of campus life.

And this complaint, oddly enough, is
probably the most justifiable one. MI, Pres-
cott has been trying for some time, with
little success, to get students to submit
short scripts showing typical incidents of
daily life. It is here tllat the show is most
obviously failing. But without full student
co—operation the show naturally cannot
function at its highest degree of efficiency

Considering the number of students with
which the producer has to work, we think
he is doing an admirable job. For instance,
few college radio programs give more var
riety in a single show. Some colleges des
vote their time totally to music, some to
roundstable discussions, and others to
drama, But in the present Grinnell series
we have had a pleasant combination of mu~
sic, drama, and campus news. Various or~
ganizations have been asked to prepare
programs showing their group as a func-
tioning unit, This has served to give the
radio audience a better understanding of
Grinnell in action.

One thing the show most noticeably
lacks is humor. It has shown the intellec-
tual side of campus through the previously
mentioned presentations, but little daily inc
cidents, and the humor of college life are
almost entirely omitted

Here, certainly, is an opportunity for
the students to make a tangible contribu-
tion to the radio show. What we should do

We have finally eliminated the old bi0~

experimental stage that promises to settle
down into a smooth working program which
will add substantially to college life.

Le’r's Dance - -

One of the most eminent distinctions of the
year rests now on the Cleveland manteli
the dance intramural trophy. There is no
other trophy which represents such a comr
bination of unanimous participation, ingen»
uity, and hard work. No other event draws
such a large audience The Night of the
Dance has always been a Grinnell highlight.

This year interest should be greater
than ever. It is almost traditional for an
upperclass house to win top honor. 1945,
however, may see a change in tradition.
All three freshman halls are filled with
girls who have flaunted their cleverness and
capability ullder upperclass noses for seven
months, In last semester’s prep skits,
Main’s discovery of America was rivaled
only by Cleveland’s women at war and
Mears’ quiet night at home, Upperclassmen
were thoroughly entertained in spite of
themselves. If the preps can show as much
spirit on March 10, James, Haines and Read
had better look to their laurels.

The variety of themes is one of the most
interesting features of the program, The
ideas last year included burlesque on the
rec room (ASTP date bureau), food ration-
ing, and exam week There was also a
pageant of the seasons, and Cleveland’s
victory garden. Since the central ideas for

the dances are always kept secret, every-‘

one is anxious to find out if their dance is
the best, and the women’s gym is the scene
of great excitement on the fateful night.
The dance intramural has deeper eff
fects than mere entertainment, It is one of
the best opportunities of the year for new
students and old ones to become well ac-
quainted. It creates a sense of unity and
co—operation and effectively promotes house
spirit. It is also the proving ground for
unused and sometimes unsuspected talent.

People work furiously on costumes, dance,

patterns, and stage effects, and everyone
discovers that the prime requisite for the
trophy is practice. When the presentation
is over, every house feels the pride of effort.

But the work has just begun, and the
question of the moment is: Which mantel
will the dance trophy grace on March 1117

Lost. strayed - -

Have you lost a pair of rabbit
fur gloves Since you came to
Grinncll? Or a pair of red wool
mittens with fur lining, or a pair
of suede ones, or an eyeglass
case, or a pair of glasses, or a
pen, or a. notebook, or a. love»let-
ter, or anyone of the “oodles"
'of items that are now on display
'in the lost and found case in the
bookstore or neatly packed in a
box in John M. Bridgham's home
right across from ARI-I.

Mr. Bridgham couldn’t quite re»
'melnber whether it was tour or
five years ago that he, as head
of the faculty committee of cam-
pus buildings and grounds, began
his career as a one man lost and
found department.

Prior to that time the various
found items would be accumulat-
ed in any one of five or six places
and students had to practically
make a. seven day pilgrimmage
to Mecca to retrieve their stray-
ed possessions. So it was that
the faculty voted to establish this
service in response to student
suggestion.

The present set-up would work

All- Girl Cast: In
Brief Music;
Dated for April

Brief Music, an all-girl play
about college life, will be pre-
sented April 20, according to
drama coach Elizabeth beeffler.

Although the cast has not yet
been chosen, tryouts are being‘
held and will probably be com»
pleted this week end.

Brier Music tells the story of
seven college girls during their
sophomore, junior, and senior
years The lines are snappy with
college talk; the play has many
situations which might arise at
Grinnell college, and the comedy
progresses at a. fast pace.

The scene is a girls’ dormitory
in a Woman’s college, and the
main action centers around the
mall shortage, Elizabeth Ralney
and Cliff Alexander are the main
characters, for they both fall in
love with the same man. The
complications arising thereof, to-
gather with all the unusual things
that happen in a girls’ dormitory,
will present a highly entertaining

play.

well, only judging by the acculn»
ulaLions at the Bridgham home
and in .the display case, Grinnell-
ians just aren't interested in
claiming what’s theirs.

All articles found in and near
the quad are turned into Miss
Gardner’s office and all articles
found arourid campus are turned
into Mr, Bridgham by students,
janitors, and professors. At pres-
cnt, scarves, gloves, and handker-
chicfs are featured on the lost
and found menu.

Mr. Bridgham urged that all
students who have lost things
during the year should come and
check with him, since he wishes
,to see the owners regain their ar-
ticles. In the past, the unclaimed
materials have been auctioned off
by some enterprising organiza—
tion and have proved rcghcr prof—
itable to both buyer and seller.
