For Instance
By Dave Sparks

We are in the war on the Contin-
ent; that is an undeniable fact.
How much are we in it: That is
a problem worth looking into, not
because the answer to that par
ticular question will give us tr
mendous satisfaction, but because
it will give us a better picture of
the shape of things to come.

It is in the air that we are
striking our. blows at Germany.
This bombing has two purposes
and is attaining two equally im-
portant results, The first job of
air power is the destruction of the
resources and i dustrial plants of
the enemy's ability to wage war.
Remember that fact; it is the first
job of air power, either ours or
theirs. The second job is to de-
stroy the enemies‘ air force and
thereby cripple his efforts at ofe
fense or defense in actual battle.

This second job seems to be re—
ceiving our greatest attention at
the moment. Early in the year ‘lt
became apparent that the com-
bined air fleets of Britain and the
United states had forced the
Germans to revise their concept
of air power. it w“ about May
when the results of this revision
became apparent. The Germans
had finally lost the initiative, they
had switched from the offensive

to the defensive, the German air-'

craft industry was now building
nothing but fighter craft, a de-
fensive weapon. The
weapon, the bomber had disap—
peared from German production
lines. This, then was the first vic—
tory accomplished by our air
power.

The second step in our victory
was the rate at which we were
able to knock down the enemy's
defense. On the same raid that

cost us a new high in losses sixty
heavy bombers, the Luftewaffe
lost one hundredvand four fighte
ers. Put that together with the
knowledge that the United states
alone is producing'twice as many
planes per month as Germany can
produce, and you have a good in-
dicator for the future.

The real proof of our victory
over the Luftwaffe on the Con»
tinent and over Germany, lies in
Russia and ltaiy. Only for short
times and at isolated points has
the German airforce appeared in
any force over the Russian front
during the recent Russian offen—
sive. Through the purgatory of
Salerno and the hell of the Vol-
turno the only form of satanic
death the enemy could not deal
out was dive bombing and ground
strafing. Why, because his alr-
craft are at home, attempting to
stop the leaks in the roof of the
fortress. Do we need more proof
of the value of our air offensive
to the picture of total war?

As for the future, President
Roosevelt in his report to Con-
gress gives the key: “We must
remember that in any great air
attack the British and American
lose a fairly high proportion of
planes and that these losses must
be made up quickly so that the
weight of the bombing shall not
decrease for a day in the future.
In fact, a high rate of increase
must be maintained accordin] to
plan. . .
