Takes Only Pioneer
First in Backstroke

By Jack Wile,

The first indoor championship
swimming meet of the IowaAsso-
elation of the Amateur Athletic
union was held in the local pool
Saturday evening with swimmers
from the Des Moines Aquadians
club taking the spotlight in most
of the events.

Bill Freeman of the Aqnadians
came in with two of the five
firsts chalked up by the Des
Moines club. He won first in the
220 yard breaststroke and 300
yard individual medley races and
came in third in the 150 yard
backstroke. Another Aquadian.
Channing Walker, came in first
in the 440 yard freestyle and
220 yard freestyle.

Jensen Takes First.

Although Malcolm ‘Jensen was
the only Pioneer swimmer to
capture a first place in the meet
when he won the 150 yard backl
stroke, Grinnell men were numer-i
oils in second positions. Darrell
Carris was second in the 440‘
yard freestyle and 220 yard free-
style; Robcrt Jensen was second
to his brother in the 150 yard
backstroke; and Dudley Conner
got a second in the 220 yard
breaststroke. Another Pioneer
SWImmel‘, Gal-l Atkins. came in
third in the 300 yard individual
medley.

All of the times in the follow.
ing summation are new records.
due to the fact that this is the
first indoor meet of the newly
organized association:

Carolyn Bludm‘n, senior resident
of head cottage, resigned her po-
sltion as editor of Doric last
night, Miss Bliidoi-n, first femi-
nine Doric editor in the history
of the s. it 13., said that she felt
forced to give up the position be-
cause, :_’It’s too hard to keep up
my reputation as a glamour girl
when I have to get out a Doric
every week. Last week, I found
three knives in my back. and 1
almost dislocated my arm trying
to remove them. What
being a glamour girl
