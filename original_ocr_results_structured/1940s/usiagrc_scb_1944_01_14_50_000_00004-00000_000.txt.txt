DAGE FOUR

For Instance l
By Dave Sparks l

With the bombing of the German
Reich and the Japanese positions
in the South Pacific so much a
part of every communique from
the war zones it seemed lihe a
good idea to see, if possible, what
the job of the airforce really is and
to wiiat degree they are succeed-
ing.

Since tiie science of air warfare
is still very iriuch in its infancy
it is difficult to find recognized
authorities on the subject From
what material there is extant it
is possible to derive one or two,
general principles that seem to
guide all our actions in this field
of combat.

The first and quite oilvious prin-
ciple is the fact that Lhe bombing
plane is the core of all action. True
there are strafing sorties and
fighter escorts that are an integx
ral part of most bombing missions
but these are primarily support
for the big bonibe The aircraft,
is an offensive u-capon and the‘
bombs are its destructive power ;

The second principle tiiat seems
to obtain deals with the four phas-
es of bombing. There are four
phases of an airial offensive and
each phase is concerned with and.
determined by the type of target
involved. The first target of the
bombing squadrons and therefore
the first phase of air war is the
destruction of the enemy’s ability
to produce the “Ellerlélls of war.
This involves the destruction of
industries and in some cases whole
cities, Bloodthii-sty as it sounds
and as revolting to our humanitar-
ian instincts as it is, it is never--
theless a fact that often the only
way to insure a production stope
page in an enemy industry is to
destroy the worker's homes and
the workers themselves. This cl'lpr
pling of industries is the goal he
hind the destruction of whole cit-
ies that we have witnessed

The second phase deals
transportation, The great port
cities of Germany and the rail
centers such as Cologne have been
the targets of our bombers because
a crippling of the enemy's ability
to supply his troops would nullify
the fighting ability and even the
existence of such troops. The
strafing sorties of our fighter
sweeps over France have often
been directed against German rail-
roads and locomotives,

The third phase is the sarcalled
"softening up" phase that we are
now engaging in down in the Mare
shall Islands, This is the home
bardment of enemy military i -
stailations that will hamper the
actions of our ground forces when
they land, both in the Marshalls
