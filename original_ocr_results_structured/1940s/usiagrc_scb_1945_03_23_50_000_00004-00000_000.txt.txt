GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Budding Artists Draw, Paint, Study,
And Design in Sternfeld’s Art Dept.

By Curlls Harnack

After climbing up the long flight
of stairs to the third floor of
the Administration biulding, 1’
found Hassie busily painting a
simple still life scene in oils.

Miss Edth Sternfeld was there,
too. only her water color class
wasn't. They ivere spread out
on the grass in the warm spring
sunshine, painting trees. The life
of an artist is easy? Just ask
Miss Sternfeld, professor of art,
or any art student,

The beginning drawing class
is now drawing three dimension-
al, abstract figures in charcoal.
First the basic geometric solids
were studied, and now the stu-

dents have drawn imaginaiy toys
out of geometric solids e doLls,
cowboys, bakers, clowns, andl
black niammys.

Getting the "inspll'htlon” to
draw is enough to scare any be-
ginner, so Miss Sternfeld ar.
rayed thirty odd pieces of ma-
chinery, household equipment,
and junk to serve as an inspira»
tion to the drawing class, The
resulting drawings showed that
the art students had an amazing
amount of latent ideas. The]
