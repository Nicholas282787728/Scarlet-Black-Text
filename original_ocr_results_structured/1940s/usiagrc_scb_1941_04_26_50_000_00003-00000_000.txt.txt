be far greater than the 75 per
cent of the senior males who
probably will be missing from en~
rollment records when college
opens in the fall.

Grinnell isn’t the only school
that will have to tighten its
belt. Every men’s school in the
country will have a difficult time
filling their classrooms. Cocduca—
tional institutions will have to
count more heavily on women's
enrollment, while girl's schools
have to battle increased pressure
that will be put on girls by co-
educational colleges and universi-
ties.

THE

Plans tor Gl'innell are as def-
inite as they can be with the
little amount of knowledge that
college otricials have in hand,
Despite rumors to the contrary.
Pine Tree Place will be open next
year. In addition, there is a very
good chance that women, instead
of men. will be housed in both
Carney and Macy houses in 5211*
tembcr,

You can probably count on next
year's freshman class being larger
than normal In addition, more
women than men will grace the
campus walk It isn’t the
prettiest picture in the world, but
it is better than nothing at all.
And Lake into consideration that
every college and university is
faced with the same problem; the
chances are that Grinnell will end
up a little better than other
schools,

Despite the fact that the trash-
man class will probably be larger

than normal, President Stevens
has said that there will be no
let down in academic standards.

There is the picture as painted
to us trom the intonnation on
hand. Next year, every college
student will ﬁnally realize that
the draft is here, maybe not to
stay. but here for a few years
at least,
