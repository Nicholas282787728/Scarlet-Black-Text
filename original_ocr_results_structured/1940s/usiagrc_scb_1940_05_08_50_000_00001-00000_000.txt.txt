Become Famous
In ‘Derby Stakes’

A frantic appeal was voiced ycSe
tel-day by the Sigma Delta Chi
brothers, sponsors of the “Brown
Derby Drag,” for entrants in the
sweepstakes which is to he held
Saturday morning at 10 a. in.

The race is hold on the dirt
road north of the dormitories
annually on the morning preceding
the “Drag." Filst prize is a free
ticket to the dance, second prize
a 2/3 reduction and third a 1/3
reduction, according to John Mes
Cluie, chairman of the sweep-
stakes.

Said Ken Mathews, president of
SDx, “To date we have received
only two entries, one from two
sophomores who say they will win
the race riding a team of horses,
and another alleged equestrian
who doesn’t sound serious, claims
he will enter in a disguise.

“No qiiadites have decided to
test the horsemanship of the riding
class, and from the looks of the
ploWsjockeyS in the field, a good
stiff walk should take first easily.
Second place should be won by
anyone who can lead a horse if
there be such a hardy soul in Grin-
nell,"

SDX has received several Sug—
gestions that the sweepstakes be
changed to a bicycle race, but the
brothers still cherishing a fond be-
lief in the Grinnell Pioneer Spirit
refused to change, McCune com-
mented.

Dibble Debutanles Bow to Society;
Style Leaders Absorb 16-6 Defeat

Approximately 155 dormitory rc-
sideiits turned saddened and damp-
cyes toward Dibblc hall yesterday
when they realized that the llol'tlls
cnd softball squad, resplendent in
NEW yellow and black uniforms,
had taken the short end of a
muddy 16 to a bout with the Gates
hall team that afternoon. In fact,
the oth - fivc dorms were almost
in despai —al.most, but not very.

The game was the first appear-
ance of uniforms in the intramural
softball competition. Dibblcmen
surprised fans by donning yellow
and black sweaters and yellow
caps for the game.

Dorm residents other than
Dibblemen, following the tradition

of “Anyone but Dibble,” were dis
most in agreement that the move
was unethical and watchers of the
game were not too unhappy when
the southern hall piled up a 15 tel
lead mid-way iii the battle.

Discussion about the uniforms:
A Clorkman, ‘Why give them new
suits just to die in?"

A Gates freshman, “Maybe they
were afraid to play hardimight
have gotten the uniforms muddy."

Rawson Vox Pop, “They looked
bilious, the unif s I mean.”

Langan Opi ion, “I dashed
downtown to see an optomeu‘lst.”

Smith (not basement). “Dibble
men showed up in their true
colors."
