Mark Twain On War

Every day now we hear such statements as
this: “We will not g t into the war come
pletely until public opinion is ready for it."
The fact that we shall eventually go to war
wholeheartedly seems to be established.
But public opinion has to be molded first}
Look back upon the history of public opine
ion starting at the time when conscription
was still an issue. What has happened to
it‘.7 What has changed it?
We think that the following statement
om Mark Twain’s ”Mysterious Stranger"
is so apropo of the present times that it
should be printed here: “The 10le little
handfulAas usualiwill shout for the war.
The pulpit—warily and cautiously—will obi
ject—at first; the great, big, dull bulk of
the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try
to make out why there should be a war, and
will say, earnestly and indignantly, ‘It is
unjust and dishonorable, and there is no
necessity for it’ Then the handful will shout
louder. A fe ‘ fair men on the other side
argue and reason against the war with
speech and pen, and at first will have a
hearing and be applauded; but it will not
last long; those others will outshout them,
and presently the antiewar audiences will

thin out and lose popularity. Before long
you will see this curious thing: the speakers
stoned from the platform, and free speech
strangled by hordes of furious men who in
their secret hearts are still at one with
those stoned speakers—as earlier—but do
not dare to say so. And now the ole na-
tionfpulpit and alliwill take up the war
cry and shout itself hoarse, and mob any
honest man who ventures to open his
mouth; and presently such months will
cease to open."

We do not present this as a cynical and
defeatist picture of what is to come in the
far future, We present it as a true picture
of the next hour and of the next day, cyni»
cal or not.

“But," one might be tempted to say, “this
war is different! We are not being led into
this war with our eyes shut."

We wonder. - ,

“This is a war of democracy ag ‘nst to-
talitarianism! We must face this thing re 1-
istically; ue can not be blinded by pacillst
ideals,”

It cannot be denied that the Hitler menace
must be defeated no matter what the cost.
But it can be denied that "We are not be-
ing led into this war with our eyes shut.”
Already such men as Eduard Belles are on
record as stating that following the war
there must be a return to the status quo,
ante bellum. Are we going into this war
merely to preserve the nationalism and type
of internationalism which produced the war
And if we go into the war on such a basis
aren’t we going into the war with our eyes
shut?

When public opinion is being molded by
such an extensive program of propaganda
as the present one, issues are clouded and
what ever little independent thought still
e. sts is dominated by abstract catch-words
and phrases. Under such conditions, it is
impossible to decide what we are going to
fight for.

We make a plea to the students ill this

college to make up their minds now, cooly
and dispossionately, over what they are will-
ing to fight for. The crisis is coming de-
spite the seemingly secure ease and laziness
of our guarded lives.
_ Are you a phrasemouther? Are you go-
ing into this thing with your eyes shut?
Are your opinions being molded by the in»

it slipped .5 of a. point from its
semester mark of 2.38.

A close similarity is evident in
the ranking ratings between the
first semester marks and those
just issued from the office of the
dean of women.

The Town women were again
second, this time with a 2.177
average, while Cleveland cottage
again retained Lhird place with a
2.133. Mears managed to beat
out Haines for fourth rating,
after tieing at the semester. Pine
Tree climbed to sixth position,
while Main and James cottages,
retaining their position in respect
to one another, slipped one place
lower each. James brought up the
last place, despite a good average
of 1.759. _

The total average for all wo-
men also slipped from a 2.05 to a
2.029 between the grading periods.

Day races. Plans to date, air
though incomplete. will probably
call for n horse race, a. bicycle
race, and a writer's race. All
applicants interested in either the.
horse or bicycle race should con
tact Kuhl immediately.

As an added inducement to stue
dents to stick around on the crime
pus for the drag, was the an-
nouncement of the annual High
School Track meet to be held here
the some day.

”This is an event you must see,"
Kuhl claimed, putting in a free
plug for the department of athr
lctics. “Then that evening, go to

robbed the most."
