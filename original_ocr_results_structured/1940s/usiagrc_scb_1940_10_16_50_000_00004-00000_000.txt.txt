Season's Toiighes

This game promises to be one
of this season's toughest for
Grinnell, as Washburn displays a
strong line with a wide open pass-
ing offense that threatens the
Pioneers' main weaknessilack of
sufficient pass defense. In their

game last week with Washington
U. the Ichabods uncorketl no less
than 23 passes. making a large
percentage of them good.

Returning in the washbrn-n line
up this year will lie Kayo Eminot.
one of the best passers in the
Missouri Valley conference. His
performance in last year’s game
at Topeka, Kan, makes him a
triplethreat against the Pioneers
for Friday night's game Another
star in the Blue and white line-
up is Isaacs. So far this year,
he’s been proving to he a good
running mate for Emmot in the
Washhurn backfield.

Night Practice.

Coach Ben Douglas. Pioneer
mentor, called a night practice
session yesterday in which he
drilled his squat] on pass defense
combinations. Douglas used a
572.21 defense at one point in
the practice with Hugh McCart-
ney.
Ray Mathews, John Kennefick
and Jerry Grant on the line; Dean
Dewitt and Tom Carmody back-
ing the line; Carl Blandin and
Don Hock in the halfrback spots;
and Fred Webb in the safety posia
tioii. Clint Taylor and Milo Run-
dall also took some turns in this
defense formation.

Two Pioneer backs that were
particularly outstanding in last
weekend's game with Knox are
Don Hippie ai\d»Augle Griiening.
Their performance should make
them eligible for more action
against Washhurn.

Injured List.

On the injured list at the
present time are Ed Walters and
Harry Barker. Both of these men
are nursing bad knees. However.
Walters should be in condition to
see some action Friday night.
Barker ’Wlll probably he out until
the homecoming game with cor-
nell, Oct 29.
