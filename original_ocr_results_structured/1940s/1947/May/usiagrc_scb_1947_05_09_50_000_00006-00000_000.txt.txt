Singing For Its Simday Breakfast

iShhh' Don't tell anyone, but‘
do you know those girls were
out all night? All eight of them:

That's what you've been hear»;
ing about the new League Board
members, Mai McMui-ray, Anna-
helle Baley, Janet Ryden, Bar-
bara Wright, Virginia Chidlow,
Delight Walker» Shirley Simon-
ski, and Anne Royal.

It all began at 1‘ .30 last stow
day morning. Doris Crowl, re-
tiring League Board prexy, in-
formed the eagerrbeavers maul
they were to preside as cooks
over the old board-s Sunday
breakfast, AFTER they had gath»
ered the necessary edibles tar
gather which had been distrihuted
at various faculty residences. The
initiates were told they could ob-
tain the wanted item by seren-
ading With a singing commercial,
substituting the name of the de-
sired article.

“Give us rolls, and wear a
smile" to the tune of the Grits
fin shoe polish commercial, greetr
ed the Evertons, who then sent
die eight peppy girls across town
to Miss Gleason. To the tune of
”Feed Your Chicks Nutrena", they
begged for bacon by singing,
“Feed the League Board bacon
—-the League Board bacon, the
‘best hogs that Nellie can buy."
After receiving refreshing drinks
(soft) from Miss Gleason and Miss
Carlson, they marched onward to
the edge of town, originating the
Grapefruit Song to the tune of
“Marqulla Banana" as they went,
The result was thi "Grapefnnts
like to hang out in the outer

boundaries of Griunell 7 And it
you do not have our grapefruit,
then you can go LDrGl'ant o.
Gide."

'Twas now 2zlh am. After re-
cuperating at the Gales, they took
off for the Ryalls, making up a
entice song to the tune of “Java
Jive" on the way, The Ryan: of-
fered the group refreshments, and

cnidlow assured Mr. Ryan that
they were aware of the fact that
not coffee, not love, but health
was the greatest thing in the
world.

Next the weary Board headed
for the Rust residence, where, in
response to an appeal through the
"Poor Little Buttercup”, Mr. Rust
offered them butter and sent
them on their my to the White
House. About this time they
were interrupted by the night
walcllmnn.‘ who informed the
night owls that someone from the
barracksaryos. the barracks, mind
yoll’ihad turned in a complaint
that someone was disturbing the
ipeace!

The highlight or the stop at the
White House was the artful dein-
‘onstratloll of Annabelle Baley and
