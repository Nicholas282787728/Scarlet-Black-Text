An Appreciation

lThe announcement of Prof. Stuart Ger-
ry Brown’s resignation from the Grinnell
faculty produces a feeling akin to a blow in
the solar plexus, To those who have known
him and studied under his stimulating lead-
ership, the loss which Grinnell suffers in

his departure overshadows, for the nlomeiltl
at least, the wellrdcserved opportunity and:
prestige offered by his new position at Syn;
acuse University.

To the men who left Grillnell to elltcl
the services, the knowledge that Prof.
Brown \lould be here was a great reassul'r
zlnce W‘ cn they wondered what sort of
school Grinnell would be when they retui-
ed. And the promise of his presence was
equally reassuring to those students who
sometimes wondered about the future of the
college iii years to come.

If Prof. Brouu were merely a stillin-
lating~ teacher and an exceedingly human
person, his loss would not be felt so keenly.
Both those qualities are his to all excep-
tional degree, but in addition he has dis,
played and taught a sense of the history
and meaning of Gl'iiinell and its place ini
American history and life. If there is a
"Griniiell spirit," and we think there is,
then Prof. Brown knows, appreciates, and:
is deeply sympathetic to its meaning; and
above all, he has managed to commuilicate'
it to the men and women who sat in his
classes and knew him personally.

Although we must accept his departure,
we can 9, Mess the appreciation of all those
Griliilell students and graduates \xho have
known and studied under him for the oppor-
tunity his presence on the campus 'has al-
forded lls.

 

,At last Ulc campus knows that
