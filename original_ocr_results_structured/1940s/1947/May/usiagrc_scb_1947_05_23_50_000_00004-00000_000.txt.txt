LeHer Frorn David JeIinek '
Describes, Life In Sweden

In a letter this week to Emmett
Goff, Smith sophomore, David
Jelinek describes student life as
he and Allan Lewis find it in
Sweden, Both young men, editors
of she Zephyr for the first se-
mester, left Grinnell in January
to study at the University of
'Stockholm.

in describing their living con-
ditioiis Jelinek writes that upon
their arrival they lived in The
Cosmopolite, a sort of glorified
boarding house (called a pension-
at), which was as cosmopolitan
as its name. Every national and
political stripe imaginable was
representedAincluding two “for-
' mer" Nazis. Since then, Jelinek
has rented a threerl'oom cottage
'voutside of the village or Tullinge,
- and Lewis has sublet an apart-
meiit,

Both men are bridging language
difficulties by taking two hours
of Swedish every day at school.
However, English is widely spoken
in the country, especially in
Stockholm,

B 01‘ R To Give Picnic
Fo'r Old, New Members

The Board of Religion will spon-
sor a picnic for all old and new

'. day afternoon. Plans for the pic-

nic, to be held at Arbor lake,‘

were made at a Tuesday after

YMCA, was present at the meet-
ing. The subject of the relation
of ywca and Board of Religion
to campus activities was discussed

and the lack of ope‘

of Swedish life, and the ex—G n-
nellian confesses that he probably
knows as much about Sweden
now as he _does about the U. S.

Jellnek tells of the publicity
they have received since their ar-
rival. Both have appeared at
meetings of groups studying Eng-
lish, and he reports that there
is much interest in the United
States.

The highlight of the spring was
a trip on April at) to the univerc
sity town of Upsala for varborgs-
nansafton, the student spring cel-
ebration. Whitercapped students
take the town by storm and the
celebration resembles an American
college‘s homecoming. Marching to
a hillrtop castle for the readings
of a proclamation, they sang
spring songs and held meetings.
The day's activities were climaxed
by a three hour Swedish dinner
and dance.

Jellnek plans to act as a boys'
counselor at a special summer
school and camp this usmmer. The
camp is in Dalarna, reputedly the

,most beautiful part of Sweden
