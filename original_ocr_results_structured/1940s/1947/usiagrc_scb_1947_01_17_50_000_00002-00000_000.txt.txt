It's Up To Us

When will the next war begin? Who will drop
the ir t bomb7 Which side will have the SUV
[WHO ty in arms and resources? These are dues
ticns heard in many campus quarters today.

But are they necessary? Has man progressed
so little dining the lust bloody conflict that he
must still rely upon such primitive methods to
settle his dlifcrellcos" We thinlt not. and we sin-
eerely hope that you agree.

And what do we propose to do about it 7 How
can we, air isolated student body, make our voices
hear-d at the peace LabIESrut the U.N. meetings?
First, we must agree that there is a solution. that
onlv in some form of world federal government can
ii-e'hopc to bring nations together toward a last-
ing- peace, and that only through that organization
can world peace be “enforced", if necessary.

There is a national student group called SLIle
dent Federalists. dedicated to furthering this cause
The president of this organization will be on the
campus tonight. He will explain fully the back
ground and arms or his group. It will then be tor
us to decide whether or not we, are willing to City
dorse it, For the sake of better world government
and a “final" peace. we hope Grilmell's answer ivill
be aifirmative.

Remember. an atomic bomb aimed for Chicago,
which should happen to miss its mark a few miles
to the West, would make Crinnell a pile of radio-
active rubble.

Now, it's up to us,

Where Credi’r ls Due

Although there may be people in the \vorltli
good peopleéwho do not feel that it is right or
natural for people of different races to live to
gather, yet even these peoplcistill assuming that
they are good peoplegmust agree that if different
races ivant to learn to live together happily, there
ought to be no man-invented obstacles to hinder
them from trying. Human bemgs will and should
strive forever toward understanding, ca»opei‘al.ion.
love, and peace.

Believing in this fundamental truth, Crin-
nellians have welcomed the proposed student ex-
change with Hampton college. They have, in fact,
congratulated themselves upon it. Why this orgy
of back s'apping? The exchange was not insti-
gated by the student body but by the Dean of the
Chapel. through suggestion of Hampton Institute.

It was not made a practical reality by the students
but by the administration. Why do we congratulate
ourselves ?

Perhaps we are prematurely praising the fine
way in which we will conduct ourselves. No one
seems to have considered that the negro students
in coming to Grinuell, a place they have never seen.
in promising to live for four months at Crinnell,
with people whom thcy do not know and will prob
ably never see again, are doing a much braver rid
riner thing than we. in our comfortable, far-o an-
environment have realized, Our lives are physically
unchanged by their coming. The s are disrupted
in a very complete manner. In addi ion to all the
regular trials of being new students, they must
face an alien state, alien people, and a certain
amount of unavoidable prejudice

Much the same situation will exist for ”the
Grinnell students who are going to Hampton.

Let’s be fair, If we do everything we possibly
can to make their stay in Grinnell a happy one,
we are still not doing one tenth as much for the
cause of brotherhood as the students who are
participating in this exchange.
