form in the in ol period. but
gave way to the Splendid play
of Pcisner in the second hulr,
Tire Maroons offered little in
the way of individual stars, but
remained a fighting outtir to
the end.

Jumping off to a two-point
edge, 7-5, at the and of eight
minutes, the Iowans were too
much for the Maroons during the
remainder of the contest.

Vanstrum and Carlson sank
buckets as the second period op-
ened to enlarge the lead to 25714.
Chicago pulled up to within four
points, 30-26, after six minutes
had passed, but then Peisner went
to work. He pushed in four quick
goals to help Grinnell pull away,
44-33. with seven turns left oil
the clock. .
With four minutes remaining,
the Pioneers were romping home
with a 12 point lead. 5mg, when
the Maroons revived themselves
with two fielders. But Grinnelll
slipped over the line with some
thing to spare as they closed outi
the contest, 57-43. on McMurray’s
mid-court swisher,
