George ‘Oches, Cowles junior,]
spoke before the American Veter-
ans Committee Wednesday evc-
ning on the subject of "Communr
ism in the eve." Oches, secrc-
tary-treasurer ot the organization,
obtained his material from AVC
headquarters which sent him all
the‘avallable information on com«
miinistic infilteration.
Most conclusive evidence that
communists and their fellow trav-
elers have little influence in the,
organization was Lhe report on
the national convention held in.
Milwaukee in June. Communistic‘

sitions in the national organiza~
tion wcr negligible, and in no
way do the basic premises of thel

said Oches.

The next meeting will be Dec,
