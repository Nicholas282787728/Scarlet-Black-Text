"will we spend our money to
build a bettcr tomb or a better
world?" said Dean Earl D. strong,
spealting betore the American
Veterans committee and the Col-
lege League of Women Voters
on “The Marshall Plan” in Cowles'
lounge Wednesday.

"The nature of the Marshall
plan is to iielp those who help
themselves and help each other,”
he said. “Unless European na-
tions can follow some sort or eco»
home life. the world is in dan—
got."

The Marshall plan, which con-
sists of emergency aid for the!
winter and a rounyeai- aid plan,
is to help the European countries
restore their production and ex-.
ports.

To illustrate the vastness or
the program, Dean Strong said
tiiat the 200 carloads or food on
the Friendship train would pro-
vide enough food for one meal toi
only the people or France.

“How much control we exercise
in the use of loans will be a?
highly debatable point,~hcstatcrl.,I
There will probably be an agency?
to procure, allocate, and direct;
the spending of the funds.

There must be cooperation
among the European countries
tor the success of the plan, he
said. The International Trade con-
ference held recently in Geneva
iS‘ an important step in this or»
roction. ‘
