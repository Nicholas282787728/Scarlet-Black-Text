GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

JANUARY 10, l947

 

Le’r's Play Ball.

What with the advent of the New Year,
We think it would be iii order to proffer a
suggestion to the Grinnell student body.
Thus far, iii the ’46-’47 sports season, all
has been commendable along the spectator-
sportsmanship line. Now, basketball and its
problems are ahead. Let’s continue our good
record of displaying to Visiting teams fair
and worthy Grinnell, audience behavior,
and thereby assist the players, the athletic
board, and the officials.

Basketball games are fast, and it is ins
evitable that some plays will he called in
correctly by the officials. It happens in the
best of basketball circles. The secret to good
officiating is to limit these errors to a mini-
mum. The officials the Grinnell athletic
board engaged for the home contests are re—
spected throughout the midwest for their
officiating abilities. They know the secret to
calling them right.

Therefore, it is the direct responsibility
of the Grinnell student body to cooperate
with the officials and the players. It can be
done without interfer‘ng in any way with
the natural display of school spirit. Stamp
on the floor, beat on the walls and the guy
or gal next to you, yell ’til your lungs are
sprung. Do all these things, but kindly re-
frain from ‘booing’ and in any manner in-
sulting the visiting players.

Especially, accord all players the cour-
tesy of keeping silent when they are shoots
ing free throws. Give ’em a break. Give the
officials a break. Give the Pioneers an hon-
est chance by giving them the best you
know in ‘Good, Fair, Sportsmanship."

Town and College

There are an increasing number of stun
dents on the campus \vho'are becoming
aware of the unrest among the town mcn
resulting from an unorganized and, in some
instances, half-hearted attempt to include
town men in the social functions and general
student activities of the college.

Altogether there are 109 town men
attending classes. Of these men, 17 are
native Grinnellians, 37 are single men liv-
ing in private homes for lack of room in the
dormitory system, and 55 town men are
married students. It must he admitted that
some of these students, besieged by postwar
problems, feel that they do not care to par
ticipate in extracurricular activities, hilt ii
larger number of them seem to be interested
ill being recognized as full-fledged Grill-
nellians.

Town men and those who live in the
men’s halls have a mutual responsibility;
town men can easily afford to spend hall
an hour a week attending housemcotinirs,
while hall members can make an effort to
welcome their affiliates and see that they
have all opportunity to become better a0
quainted. Houselneetings are often neces-
s rlly routine, for the business of the ever
nillg may be nothing more than the usual
of cial announcements, but there is no rea-
son why a hall smoker could not be held
with the resultant opportunity to talk over

campus news. Hall budgets could afford in-
vitations to dinner for those who do not eatl
in the college dining rooms.

Last of all, an efficient means of com—
nlunication should be found. Perhaps a prep
committee could be appointed to contact hall
affiliates whenever some unusual or impor~
tant hall function is to be held. Town men
should also be notified when house meetings
have been cancelled; nothing can be more
discouraging to hall loyalty than to trudge
through a snowstorm, only to find that
meetings have been unexpectedly cancelled.
The bulletin board in the bookstore could
be used to greater advantage if hall officials
would use it [or announcements that con—
cern town students, and if these students
would make a point of watching for special
notices.

A new semester is beginning, and a
greater spirit of fraternity is in order. Town
men will learn that Grinnell consists of
more than sixteen hours of classes, and halls
will discover many Valuable volunteers for‘
their coming intramurals, as well as a num—
ber of affiliates well worth knowing. Grin-
nell is a community. It is not large enough-
for cliques. '

Zephyr’rorial

Our baited breath has almost reached
the halitosis stage (even our closest friends
wouldn’t tell us), as we expectantly awaitl
the ar val tomorrow night of our so-calledi
humorous counterpart, the Zephyr, other»,
wise known as the Sleezy Breeze, or the
Bawdy Bugle.

. What will it be this time—a regurgita-
tll‘i"' account of another guest speaker; a
vicious attack on somebody's poor grey-hair-
cd mother; a droll narrative, using the best
in campus banter to tear limb from limb this
sacrosanct jourlial‘.7

We inllst learn to accept this rag as a
somewhat necessary evil. After all, who
would criticise the S & B if the Zephyr

LeHers To
The Ecli’ror

This IS a lettcr of apprecia-
tion to the students of Grinnell
college.

Psychological research often
calls for the cooperation of large
numbers of people. We have al—
ways felt that we could count on
the help of Grinnell students in

‘our work, but just before vacav

hon we had an example of mic
wlmleheartedness with which
they will participate. 27o Grin-
nellisns were asked to take sev-
eral minutes of their time to
fill in a. rating scale. 253 of
these appeared at one of the sug-
gested times. and many of the
remaining 17 explained why they
could not fit their schedule to
the one we had to follow.
such cooperation is a tribute
to the spirit of Grinnell, and we
wish to express our sincere sp
precintion to these students. Not
only has our work been made
easier, but the cause of the re-
Search has been furthered.
Yours very truly,
George D. Lovell,
Assoc. Prof of Psychology
