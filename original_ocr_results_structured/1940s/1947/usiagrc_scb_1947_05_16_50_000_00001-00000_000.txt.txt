:Drama Dept. Presents nPlay
,AboutA Play" 8:30 Tonight

' Joan Of Lorraine
, To Be Offered
Friday, Safurday

This evening and tomorrow
icvening at 8:30 the curtain of
ARH auditorium will go up on a
bare rehearsal stage for the action
of Maxwell Anderson's Joan of
Lorraine. A play about a play,
Joan 01 Lorraine gives several
,principals of the cast double roles.
Jo Wilson, Main freshman, plays
‘Mal'y Grey and Joan of‘Arc, while
lKelth Clson, Dibble sophomore, will
handle the roles of James Mas-
ters, the director and The Inquisir
tor,

The action of the play revolves
around a play in rehearsal. Tra-
ditional stage procedure isbroken
by the seating and movement of
the actors among the audience.

Anderson's Joan has been a
bone of contention among critics
,since the play first opened last
iivintcr Unlike Shaw's play, which
characterizes the Maid of Orleans
|as a robust, pugilistic leader of e
icause, Anderson's work attempts
‘no definite characterization.

in Joan oi Lorraine the maiden

leader of the French troops for
the repulse of English forces
from France is a sweet feminine
girl. By Anderson's treatment
Joan becomes a vehicle for a de»
bate on faith, rather than a
strong personality.
. The crinnell production is being
directed by Prof, Kent Andrews,
assisted by Patricia Smith, Read
senior, as student director.
