Jacobson Leads‘ Satire Cast.
In Oscar Wilde Society Play

A caricature of London high
society in the Victorian age was
drawn last night for the first
night audience of “The Impon
tance of Being Earnest." Oscar
Wilde's “trivial comedy for ser-
ious people" will be repeated to-
night and tomorrow night in
ARI-I auditorium.

A li ht, tonguerinrcheek form
of satire, “The Importance of
Being Earnest" is, in effect, a
cartoon in action. Its characters
are caricatures of universal‘
types of people, rather than be-
iirg drawn from real life. While
much of its satire oil/the period[
has become obscure since it was
first produced in 1395, the chief‘
value, of the play to present day
an‘ nccs lies in its humor and
satire on people. The best knowni
of \Vilde‘s comedies, it has been
rcvrved periodically, most rcccnts
ly by John Clclgud in 1947.

Ann Jacobson ruled with un-;
compromising domination and‘
sustained influence as Ladyl
Bracknell, the domineering mill.»
ron.

Elaine Baer was a very precise
and proper daughter, Gwendolyn,
‘and did an admirable job of last-
rninute pinch-hitting for Carol
Jackson, who was unable to par-
ticipate because of illness. By
_contrast, the Cecily of Dorothy
Hume, was delicate, almost in—
tangible.

A sensitive portrayal of Alger-
non, the debonaire young blade,
was given by David vinje. John
Thompson was practical and
worldly as his partner in “Ear-
nes'l-ness, Jack Worthing.

Nancy Kassehaum and Robert
Bredeson played Miss Prism and
the Reverend Canon Chausihle
wmi due Victorian primness.

An obtrusive stylized set in
muted primary colors vied con-
stantly with the cast for atten-
tion, and made a greater degree
of overplaying necessary.

“The importance of Being Ear-
nest" marks the first appearance
