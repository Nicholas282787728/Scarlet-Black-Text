The heated controversy over President
Roosevelt’s appointment of Henry Wallace
to the position as head of the Department
of Commerce reached its climax this week
The senate has yet to confirm the appoint-
ment before Wallace is in the cabinet. In—

cluded in the Department of Commerce is _

“the most colossal banking institution the
world has ever known, either public or
private”—that is, the Reconstruction Fi-
nance Corporation.

The RFC has blanket authority for
loans, the right to issue any number of
bonds, flllly guaranteed by the government,
and is practically immune from the control
of congress.

Under Jesse Jones, congress didn’t fear
the gigantic powers the department of come
merce has in the RFC, but with the ap-
pointment of Wallace, the _“George Bill"
was immediately proposed and is likely to
pass through the senate, The George Bill
divorces the RFC from the department of
commerce, leaving the latter only as a
service agency.

At the time of this writing, it is almost
certain that the George Bill will pass the
senate along with the confirming of Wal-
lace as Secretary of Commerce Thus
stripped of power, Wallace will have lost
his one chance of holding the reins of the
Democratic party and being in an excellent
position in 1948 to bid for the presidency.

It is evident that the controversy is
strictly political ill nature The contest ill
the senate is a reenactment of the conflict
at the Democratic convention last June
when Wallace was rejected. But what is
wrong with Wallace? Why does Congress
so violently oppose him“.7

Wallace’s reputation among some con-
gressmen is that of a dreamer, an idealist,
a thinker with visionary thoughts of revis-
illg the worldgthoughts that Clare Booth
Luce called “globaloney.”

Yet what does he plan to do in the de,
partment of commerce that worries Con-
gress? He stated to the senate commerce
committee that he doesn’t confine commerce
activities merely to this country, but he
says that federal loan agencies "provide an
opportunity both here and abroad for in-
telligent work in behalf of the producing
and consuming pllbIICl"

He is determined to ca 'ry out the Presie
dent's program of providing sixty million
jobs after the war. He says America must
remain the land of high wages and effi-
cient government No special classes will
be favored. Furthermore, with jobs for all
at good wages, and with the foreign mare
kets expanded, the farmer will be able to
sell all that he can raise. With government
responsibility in cases of extreme risk, free
enterprise can flourish.

Wallace plans to adopt a housing prov
gram. He plans to expand the educational
system; he wants more schools and more
and better teachers. Wallace wants old age
insurance for all, He says ”Our democracy
can be a living force only if it means the
good life for all people, Government must
accept the duty of seeing that all men ill
declared Wallace, as-
serting that “the common man need not
tolerate less prosperity in the time of peace
than he had in time of war.”

Wallace is staking his political life on
the hope that the senate will approve his
program and his ideas about post-war econ-
omy. But should the senate feel that Wale
lace’s experience ill the Department of Ag-
riculture and as the Vice-President of the
United States is not sufficient to manage
the Department of Commerce, should they
pass the George Bill which separates the
RFC, but yet confirm Wallace’s appointe
ment to Secretary of Commerce, they will
have stowed Wallace and his spending
theories safely away in cold storage for the
duration, and perhaps for a long time to
come.

Dear Editor:

The War Council would like to
call to the attention of the stud-
exits the current rationing probe
lems and paper drive of the
school.

In addition to the same ration-
ing problems which our parents
encounter, the college has the
difficulty of obtaining supplies
for 350 people. It is not always

as simple to find large supplies,

as to find enough for a family.
Miss Gleason tries to prepare a
balanced meal within the allotted
points, Not as many eggs have
been used this year as last in
meeting the rationing problem.
A good supply of chickens can be
found to ease the difficulties ivith
red coupons.

Frequently. moreover, it is hard
to plan ahead since trucks do not
always arrive on time. In the
subrzero weather this month, sup-
plies wcrc sometimes frozen and
had to be returned. ,

The Housekeeping Department
has received word from the man-
ufacturer that the furniture in
