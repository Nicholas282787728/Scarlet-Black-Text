Chiang. the Silent - -

Americans have just begun to realize how
tremendously important lvill be China’s dips
lomatic role in the next few year There
is a relatively new and disheartening
thought which has found its way into the
minds of the students, businessmen, laborv
ers: If China unexpectedly allied herself
with Japan, our Pacific war would be in-
definitely prolonged Sufficient occupation
and control of Chinese territory would take
many years of American mi tary domina-
tion. There is even a possibility that it
could never be achieved

What started this idea of a Chinese-
Japanese alliance? Why are we beginning
to distrust our once unquestioned ally?
What is the basis for such belief? The one
swers to these questions lie, to a very great
extent with one man, He is China’s famed
Nationalist leader, tlle mind and spirit of
the Koumintang, the enigma of the century
—Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shelf.

Until quite recently high school students
were led to think of Roosevelt, Churchill,
and Chiang almost synonymously in terms
of what they were trying to accomplish [or
the world, Because all three were fighting
the same country, it seemed to follow that
they were fighting for the same cause.‘
This is obviously absurd. We fight for our-
selves; so do the Bi tish, And, likewise,
under the direction of Generalissimo Chiang
the Chinese are fighting for China. It is
Chiang‘s ultimate goal to “win for our
country independence and equality among
the family of nations.” There are, of
course, people who charge that the Gener-
alissimo is not fighting for the good of his
nation but rather for the good of Chiang
Kai-shek, that he is too interested in cap-
ital business, hank backing, and other
“Soongish” problems. But these assertions
are things which only time can prove, and
from a Chinese viewpoint we Americans,
casting the stones, may well look to the
care of our own glass house,

The main factor which is turning Amer-
ican opinion against Chiang is his persist—
ence in using men and materials to fight
the 90 million Chinese communists rather
than the Japs. Before China declared war
against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek, having ale
most reversed the ideas instilled in him by
the great revolutionary leader, Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, began bitterly to oppose all com-

munistic factions in China. By 1936 Gen-‘
eral Chiang had achieved complete dicta-
tor ike powers in Chinese government. He
was still fighting communists although;
Japan had invaded Northeastern China}
when, in December of that year, his mys

terions kidnapping by younger army offi-
cers el'fected enough of a change so that
upon returning he began actual war with
Japan.

In September, 1987, the Chinese Com-
munist Party issued a manifesto offering
their services to the National Government.
To this gesture Chiang replied that “the
National Government will be glad to en—
list the support of all parties which desire
to come under the leadership of the Room—
intang for a struggle for national existe
ence.” In no part of his statement did‘
the wily Generalissimo commit himself
with any promises to the Reds. He ac
cepted their help rather condescendingly-
and left himself the privilege of changing
his mind about their intentions.

Apparently Chiang Kai-slick feels the
communist threat to be very illipol'tant.i
More important than the fight againstl
Japan? Well, he takes men from one to
fight the other, and it has been said that
he withholds American materials for his
own private war. It is a point under cone]
sideration whether the Gelleralissimo would‘
join the Japanese if he felt their aims to
be more propitious for his cause. He can
hardly be expected to feel altruistic sentie
ments for Great Britain and the United
States. If Japan’s practical worth to
China begins to exceed that of China’s
present allies, will the General try to
change sides?

It is a question which cannot be one
swered until experience has proved an zin-
su‘er.

Keep It Working - -

Semester exams present ollr honor system
with its second big trial. Inaugurated last
spring in time to apply to finals, it has
been functioning during the present semese
ter; and we feel has demonstrated its
workability.

The approaching tests however, will tend
to emphasize weaknesses which might not
become apparent in the ordinary course of
a semester, In addition there is a large
group consisting of freshmen and transfers
for whom these will be the first semester
tests under the honor system. It is going
to be necessary therefore to overcome the
passive attitude which is prevalent among
us. That the system has been a success has
been due to the students It is not some
thing which we can accept and in so doing
dismiss. The continued success of the
honor system will be dependent upon the
interest of each student. i

We are personally proud of the system.
Student sponsored, it is representative of
the possibilities of student cooperation and
participation, We hope that when its worth
has been demonstrated here, the results
can be reported to other schools which may
desire to institute some similar plan.

.It remains for each of us to re-read the
pamphlet issued at the beginning of the
semester in which the operation of the
honor system was explained. The future
of the honor system rests with us.

[ With Other Colleges

Did you ever wish you could push
a button in your car and open
the garage doors without getting
cold or Wet? ‘

A university of Texas commu-
nicatlons engineer says it can be
done in fact, he’s invented
the device for domg it, and has
tested it on his own car end ga—
rage for the past two years. It
works perfectly. he says.

Jack Msguirc, chief communie
cations engineer fer the universi»
Ly, expects to apply for :3 patent
on his lnvention.

Especially designed for garage
doors which pull up and roll
overhead, it will work only for
motorsoperated doors, he said.

“A push button on the dash-
board of lhc cni- sets up a high
frequency impulse that is picked
up by a coil buried beneath the
ground in the drivewey, and is
transmitted to a device which
puts into operation a motoreopv
erated door," he explained. This
allows the door ls be opened
when approaching or leaving the
gsrege.

Best of all, says this engineer,
is the fact that the monthly
cost of operating the control de—
vice would be no more expensive
than e one-fourth watt lamp:

Presenting viewpoints both for

If the British allow the Greek
