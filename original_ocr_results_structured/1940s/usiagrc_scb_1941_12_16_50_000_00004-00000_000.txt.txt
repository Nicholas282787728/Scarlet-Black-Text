half victory over Knox col-
lege 46 to 29 in a game
which featured ragged play
on both sides.

Paul Patterson, and Edd Bow.
ers led the Gl-innell offense
with 12, 13, and 10 points,
respectively, while Bowers
was outstanding defensively.

Siwasll quintet with seven
points.

McCartney and Waters sent
the score up to 27-19. In the next
five minutes, seven field goals
and three charity shots out the
game on ice for the Pioneers.

At this point Coach Ben Doug<
las began sending in a steady
stream of reserves. It was not
until 16 minutes of the second
half had been played that Knox
fmzlly hit the basket from the
tield. In the last four minutes of
the game, Knox rallied to pour 10
points through the net.

Wild and Ragged.

The game was wild and ragged
and seldom was their any indica-
tion of smooth playing. Time and
time again Gilnnell threw the hall
away by erratic passing.

Friday night the Grinnell rive
ivill meet the Cornell Purple and
Saturday night the Pioneer q‘lline
tet Will travel to Ames to meet
the high scoring Iowa state team.
