In regard to the carnival it-

egg-throwing sideshow, with the
eggs selling three-foi-a-dinie and
Ray 0. Gustarson and Robert
Green on the receiving end of the

According to several spectators,
this concession was also the most
dangerous, with many nonrpaymg

Wiiii ”Spring Day"—

Conard Comes To Power

By Catherine Funk

Spring Day, considered a “Lost

for “Grmiicll Selfrlmpravement

the community to servile labor.

Rudolf Hess had to run away

Reversal of
Presen’r Grading
Sys’rem Sought

By Ray Jewett

The student proctoring sys-
tem, which was initiated last
semester, was officially aban-
doned by the Student Council
last night, meeting in a com-
plete body at Carney House.

Other action taken by the
group included a recommen-
dation to go to the administra-
tion and faculty that the college
adopt the “A B C” system of
grades and the appointment of
five students to form a club to
stage a musical show.

Voting to discontinue the use
of students as proctors, the coun-
cil decided to recommend to the
Faculty committee that outside
assistance be employed to at-
tempt to prevent cribbing. The
group also felt that the faculty
should take a more strict hand in
the prevention of cheating.

It was believed by the council
tbat in employing outside help
there would be no favoritism
shown in the proctoring system.
