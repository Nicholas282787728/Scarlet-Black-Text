Hope From Yal‘l‘a - -

The unanimity that came out of Yalta last
week was sorry news for the Nazis. at bay
between the onrushing Red army in the
east and the relentless British and Amery
icans in the west, With the successful or-
bitration of the differences between the
Soviets and the western powers went the
feeble hope that the Germans had of sal-
vaging something from the chaos of a Big
Three split. Also with the agreement came
the first real basis for a lasting peace~
evidence that the big three can cooperate
in political and economic matters as well
as military ones.

Many major decisions had to be made,
difficulties discussed and resolved, and
concessions granted before the announce-
ment was made to the waiting worl “Our
meeting here ill the Crimea has reaffirmed
our common determination to maintain and
strengthen in the peace to come that ullity
of purpose and of action which has made
victory possible . . . "

The joint statement issued by Marshall
Stalin, Prime Minister Churchill, and Presi—
dent Roosevelt was made in general terms.
At this Writing we do not know the exact
plans made for military operations, for the
settlement of boundaries, nor for the oc-
cupation of Germany, But the significant
fact is that such plans were made, and in
minute detail. The accomplishment of the
three leaders in reaching workable compro-
mises on such controversial topics is un»
surpassed in diplomatic history. That these
decisions included a sensible adjustment of
goligical idealism to political reality is evi—

en .

Examining the known facts of the con—
ference, we may see how reality and ideal-
ism were brought together without dispense
ing with either, Military plans are not
being made public for obvious reasons of
security All that we know is that complete
cooperation will be maintained In regard
to boundaries, it is provided that final set;
tlement of this vital question should await
the end of the war, but preliminary agree-
ment has provided that Russia accept mod»
ifications ill her claims of a Curzon line

permit her to make almost any demands}
shows a genuine wish for world cooperation
and a realistic approach to the problem.

Although the exact zones of occupation
after Germany’s fall were not announced,
the three powers said that France would
be invited to take part in the occupation;
andto sit on the central control commission
in Berlin. Again the leaders have been
realistic. Although France’s power is at a
low ebb, it has been recognized that her
geographic position and historical situation
make it impossible to set up any European
order without her participation.

The conferees have faced the economic
situation squarely. Although reparations

'arc demanded, they are to be “in kind" andl

”to the greatest possible extent.” Here is!
evidence of the lesson learned in post-
World-War-One reconstruction: that a nation
bled dry by war cannot raise huge sums of
money to pay its conquerors without vastly
retarding the return of the conquered na-
tion to peaceful and profitable pursuits. Af<
ter the defeat of Germany, labor battalions
will rebuild the Russian cities that the Wet-
macht ill its power destroyed. German rail-
roads and factories will be moved to the
victorious countriesithis is as it should be.
But the defeated nation will not be asked
to produce great sums for monetary pay,
ment out of thin ai

A great principle of the Atlantic charter
will be followed in the reconstruction. That
principle is the right of the people to choose
the form of government under which they
will live—the restoration of sovereign rights
and self government to those peoples who

> have been forcibly deprived of them by the

agressor nations. Since the first World War,
this has been the unrealized goal of the
democracies. That the Russians have agreed
to this concept is a great step in the ad,
valicement of lasting peace.

The world security counsel has become -
reality at Yalta. Although final plans fo
its formation were left for the San Fran-
cisco conference to be held ill April, it is
revealed that the Big Three have reached
This
was a major stumbling block in the Dum—
barton Oaks conference because of Stalin‘s
insistence that any major powe should be
able to veto’any action against itself. Al-
though we don’t know as yet the exact de—
cision that has been reached in this respect,
it will be announced to the public after
consultation with China and France. It ap-
pears that the Allies have again faced and
eliminated their differences in this issue.

Russia has long been the X quantity ill
the international equation. With an econ-
omy and political organization so different
from that of the western world, she was
not soon accepted. When her power made
her part of “polite society," internationally
speaking, she was haughty about taking the‘
-est of the world into her confidence. Now
it appears that she is ready to take her
place. Many questions about Russia were
answered at Yalta . one mayor one re—
mains: Will she fght Japan? We would
guess that in the eight days that Stalin,

' Churchill, and Roosevelt sat around the con,

fereuce table, some indication was given as
to how this question will be answered. We
would guess that Russia, in her desire to
maintain her alliance with the western powr
ers, will go to war against our enemy.
Russia, like the rest of the world, is com-
bining reality with ideology.

It seems that there is an old,
old custom that hasn’t quite fall-

st. Valentlhe's Day being pretty
special for guys and gals, and a
regular field day for Cupid. A
number of Grinnell traditions
have been forgotten because of
the war, and a number of pretty
little habits all over the world
have had to be glven up, but
Wednesday proved that fellows
everywhere, from Dur own cam-

about the customary procedure

Clothi; Needed
For Belgian War
Relief Society

The War Service Council has been
asked to collect clothing for the
Belgian War Relief Society.

According to a letter received
from Madame Betty Barzin. rep-
resentntive of the Friends of Bel<

gillm, their need for warm cloth~.

mg is critical. Not only have the
Germans taken away must of the
wool cloth in the country, but
there are also thousands of (am-
ilies whose homes have been de-
strayed by bombs, and thousands
at refugees from the battlefields.
Students at Grinnell are being
asked to give whatever may can.

Madame Barzm was here on
the campus last year and led a
series of discussions on present
day world political problems for
both college students and the A.
s. T. Unit. ‘ ‘

room looked more like c florist's
shop than anything so prosaic
as just a dining room. Not so
obvious, but surely as endearing,
were the boxes of candy and
gifts of jewelry that descended
upon the willing, eager, and
though they wouldn’t admit it,
expectant co-eds.

Another very acccpmble way
of signifying it deep love for the
extra-special girl, and a note—
worthy respect for the Valentine
tradition, 15 c tightly packed box
of food from Mom and a check
from Pop. Although Cupid prob-
ably didn't engineer it, he would
surely pass nppmval on that
kind of a Valentine.

In the good old days when
Grinnell was a whole college in-
stead of the female half of one,
rumor has it um: the mails were,
filled with comic Valentines In—
tention ~ to deﬂate. The biggest
event of the hearts and Cupid
season was the annual Valentine
dance. Intention — run.

This year’s celebration was car-
ried on almost exclusively by re~
mote control, but the results
seemed to Satisfy everyone. The
little rosy glow hovering over
the quad. and the atmosphere of
happiness pervading the campus
should lust for about a week—
until the flowers wilt, and the
candy is completely devoured
