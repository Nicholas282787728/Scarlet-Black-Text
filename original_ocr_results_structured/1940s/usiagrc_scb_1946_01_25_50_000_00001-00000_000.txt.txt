:Vets Sponsor Cellar Opening;
:OPA Permit Needed for Grill

e
party last Saturday night,

The vet—Sponsored Cyclone Cellar staged its opening

with two floor shows high-

lighting the evening. The grill, formally dubbed the Cen-

tury room, was opened, with
man, and Maynard Kenyon,
temporary chefs. Dancing,

Harold Osborn, Dibble fresh-
Cowles freshman, acting as
bridge, ping-pong, and pool

were also part of the entertainment.

The Cellar lounge has remained
open since that time, but techni-
cal difficulties have forced the
vets to close the grill for the
present. John Moon, social chair—
man of the group, states that it is
hoped that it can be reopened
sometime during exam week, but
until an OPA permit can be ob-
tained, no definite date can be
set.

The following smtement has
been issued .to the student body
by the Anchors and Eagles:

1. Until technicalities with the
OPA and the state Restaurant
Permit Board are ironed out, the
grill will remain closed.

2. We have found it exceedingly
difficult to hire a person to ope-
rate the grill.

3. The recreation room will re-
main open from 8:00 a. in. until
10:00 p. m. We shall not open
until the grill is able to comply
with requirements of the two
agencies mentioned in paragraph

bleachers, according to estimates
