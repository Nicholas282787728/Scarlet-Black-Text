Comment

We are indebted to Mr. Dunner, chairman of the po-
1' ical science department, for this charming little idea that
follows which we feel should be brollght to the attention of
our readers and, through them at polling time, to the law»
makers and executives of the United States government.

'With all the recent talk about deficit financing and
public dept VS. cost cutting and budget balancing, an inter-
c ting note appeared the other day ill a political philosophy
c ass while the poet-patriot of jolly old Englind, John Mil-
ton, was under di oils 'on. A biographical point noted was
i‘iut the author of P: ‘adise Lost and Aeropagiticus was at
one time the Latin Secretary to Crom ll‘s government of
tile commonwealth. Milton was, briefly, in charge of getting
government documents translated into Latin,

It seems that at that period in English government all
correspondence with foreign nations was carried on in the
tongue of the scholars for the bcttel understandin ' of e ,
l caning. This in itself is not a bad idea in the light of the
modern usage of double-talk as the chief language medium
0" the diplomats.

But it was further suggested that a return to that
piait‘iice, Latinizing ‘all diplomatic and government corres-
pondence, would automatically solve the problem of cutting
'down of the federal payroles and balancing the budget.

Nottice the following scene:

"‘Miss Quigley, will you come in for dictation now?”

“Yes, Mr. Stately, right away, sir."

“Ah . um . . . yes, sit down Miss Quigley, must get
right with this, you know. We’ve got to keep up that old“
efficiency rating. Hailia. We’re just tiny cog-s in the Vast
machine of government but we must play out our part, you
kamli” _ :WEM‘E

“Yes, sir, just like you always say, sir."

“Good, good: Well let's get going . . , ah .
trouble, Miss Quigley?”

“Tis pesky old pencil point, broke again!”

“There, there, that’s alright, we all have our little ups

d downs, harha. Here, take mine. There, now, ready‘.7
C od, let’s begi : Ad Marcus Tullius Fastfinger, Major
Doliio, Pi'aetor de . . . ”

“Ma_' r who, 1\ . Stately?"

“No you don't understand . . , Major Dollie .

“0h . uh .

“Yes, yes, of course, Quigley. Shall we go on? Good:
All but sum sic ibid . ”

*“Ah . . , Mr. Stately?"

“Quodani in tres pa‘rtes et cetera . . . ”

“Mr. Stately, sir?”

“Yes Quigley‘l”

”What‘s that all about sir? I just can’t seem to under-
stand you tliis morning. Don’t you think maybe you ought
to' go home and rest today 27"

“Rest nothing! Why I feel grat!‘ I was speaking Latin
just now , , . you remember ‘Memo to all departments No.

“But hr. Stately, , I don‘t know anything about

“Nenenrno sir, I don’t.”

Dear Editor:

A collection taken at the last
home game paid for :i band trip
and left a surplus of about $70.
I object to the present locatiun
of that $70, and to the manner
in which the subject was
handled.

Admittedly an econ ma'jori
and precedent too, probably ——
would sidc with the student
council, which had nobly ugrccd
to make up any deficit if the
funds contributed wercri’t enough
to cover the ti‘ip's cost.

But the announcement at
Homecoming Said BAND. So the
audience contributed to the
BAND. Each dime, each dollar
was understood to be for the
BAND's use, But they of the
grasping arm: ”We took the risk,
so what’s left is our'n”

is it? How can the student
council morally kccp what was
intended for their
use?

A handful of representatives—
bless them—opposed and were
voted down by the rest or the
council in an hourrlong discussion
about the band's money. A sug-
gestion was actually made that
the representatives make no
mention of the matter at the
weekly housemeetings.

Oh, come on it! Ignore a mat
tel: that took up so much of that
body's presumably valuable time?
The suggestion was finally toned
down to make the matter option-
al—that is, if any member preA
ferred, he could forgel the en-
tire matter. I wonder how many
cottages and halls learned of the
affair.

Whether the band uses the‘
surplus for trips, for uniforms,
for a medal for Mr, Simmons or
what have you, give them what’s
theirs. Unless they can’t be
trusted with such a fortune.

rm surprised somebody didn’t
suggest a bandrtrlp fund for
which the 370 could be earmark
ed. If a collection has to bc taken
every year, wouldn‘t such a my
serve minimize a serious financi-
31 risk such as that taken by the
student council? Certainly the
council should welcome such a
noble responsibility.

Yours truly,
Ray Maneki

P, 5. To President Peisncr: if
you read my note to Mary
Squires, student body sccrctury,
you will remember that it was
only an invitation to state and
explain lhc student council’s
stand on the band funds. The
action was taken in the interests
of fairness. and because the of.
ra seemed in nccd of a little,
ng. ,

 

Dear Editor:
There is a rcal question in my
mind as to whether the pi
cceding letter is a sincere critic~
ism of Student Council action 0

1 think that in beginning this review of the Margaret Web-
ster production of the} "Taming of the shrew" which last Monday
evening dazzled the high school auditorium With an unusual splen‘
dor, I shall reach deep down into the cliche bag fora choice spcci-
mebn. To put It mildly, this year’s oncert series started it: with
a ang.

mcrcly an attempt to provide
the 5&1; and

This question stems from the fact
that last week Mr. Maneki, ap~
parently actmg in the capacity
of a reporter for the 5&3, sent
a note to the secretary of the
Student Council which stated
that a letter was in the hands of
the 5&3 which presented an ob-
jection to the CounCil’s action
concerning the Homecoming
band collection, and that the
5&3 would welcome a letter
ircm the Council answering this
objection. When Mr. Maneki was
asked for the letter so that an
answer could be formulated, he
stated that actually there was no
leter, that it was only an idea
he had, and that if he coundn't
find someone to write it he may
have to produce it himself. So
he did. And hence my question.
However, since lhe,letter has
appeared, l feel the full facts
behind the Council's action
should be made known.

The entire Situation arose when
Mr. Simmons came to talk to
me, explaining that the band’s
collection in past years at lhc
Homecoming Game had varied so
much that he would like the
Student Council to guarantee the
transportation cost to send the
band to Coe on Oct, 22. He estir
mated the cost at 312000 He

said that such a guarantee would

mean that the Council would
make up any deiiclt and retain
any proof, In regard to the ob-
jcction made, Mr, Simmons said,
“We buih understood the agree-
ment. 1 see nothing unethical or
unmoral in placing the money as
you did." I presented this pro-

For the past two weeks, the W

reports from hall, cottage, and faculty representatives have
been encouraging, although it is too early to tell whethcl

As \V. S. S. F. committee members pointed ‘

Tile “They" refers to students and proch or in the shatei

“FOR THOSE WHO CARE”

TAILORING AND REPAIRING

its readers with}
some JLliCy controversial materiai,‘

 

Indicative, perhaps, of the
general interest hcreabcucs- in
the legit theater, the SRO sign
was up almost ten minutes be-
fore the curtain. The audience
was that unusually pleasant am;
algam of quiet and responsive—
ness that makes being a meme
ber of it a joy and a privilege.

Youthful Actors

Miss Webster’s group of youth-
ful actors threw into the well
known Shakespeare farceavitlr
in arfarce a little more enthu-
siasin perhaps than subtle theat-
rical skill, but the evening, for
me at any rate, was one of pure
enjoyment. ,

With that staggering agility of
timing exhibited by hull fighl~
ers and burlesque comedians,
Mr, Larry Gates, as the tippling
tinker Christopher Sly, turned
in the most accomplished per-
formance of the evening, pan-
tomiming, cavorting, and now
and again leaping apparently for
pure enthusiasm all over the
oft-juggled single setting.

The two leading ladies of the
cast, Miss Daren Leslie and
Miss Louisa Horton, as the
gentle Bianca and the Lin-gentle
Kate, namesake of the play,
gave convincing performances
and further bolstered up a pet
theory of mine that a few live-
ly and attractive pigeons make-
the perfect frosting for any
theatrical crumpet.

Properly Shrcwish Kale

At iii-st Miss Horton had me
a little worried because, well
frankly, a tomato oi her pmr
portions isn't exactly my idea of
the B' 'd’s scorpion in skir
But as the eyening progressed,
my worried brows uneknitted
themselves when Miss Horton
turned on the shrewishness. Her
pcrformancc adequately dispell-
ed the notions of~ gcnirlity and
qiiictude implied b her obe
vious pi, cal chair!

The high point of he even-
il‘ig's comedy after the introduc-
tion and awakening of tinker
Sly. came for me in the scenes
involving Pelruchio‘s madcap
crcw of serving boys There is
something about that sort of in-
sanity that finds me complete-
ly vulnerable even while trying
to be critically objective.

Too Jazzcd Up?

One of the most favorable
commcnfs (although in most
cases it wasn’t meant that way)
that l heard after the shouting
was over was that “Shakespeare
would never recognize it!" This
