Vets Must Apply
For Leave Time

Under New Ruling

Veterans Administration today
announced two major changes
in its leave policies affecting
veterans training under the GI
Bill in job training establish.
ments and in schools below the
college level.

The changes are:

l. Allowing these veterans to
apply for 15 days leave at the
end of their period of enroll.
ment, in addition to whatever
leave they might have been
authorized while in training.

2. Placing full responsibility
for granting leaves of absence

taken' during training 4 within} _

a limit of 30 days a year 7
upon schools below college level
and job training establishments.
This responsibility does not ex-
tend to the l5 days given at the
end of an enrollment period.

A veteran may obtain leave
at the completion of his period
of enrollment only if he has
enough remaining entitlement
to education and training to
cover it.

Under VA’s new policy of
turning over responsibility for
granting leave to training insti—
tutions. leave taken during
training now becomes a matter
strictly between the veterans
and his school or employer
trainer.

Only absences to be reported
to VA in the future are those
considered by the school or as
tablishment to be unauthorized,
as well as time off in excess of
30 days in calendar year, ex-
clusive of Saturdays, Sundays
and holidays.

These reports are necessary so
that VA may make appropriate
reductions in veterans’ subsis-
tence allowances. vA empha—
sized that all schools—including
colleges—should continue noti-
fying VA of all interruptions in,
or discontinuance of, training.

Wild-Blaing, Gumshoeirlg, Tight,
VA Says; Advises Farming

If you banker after the wild
blue yonder, the pungent odor
of newsprint and ink, or the
cloak and dagger, the advice of
the Veterans Administration is
to forget it . . . or at least take
a minor in steam fitting.

In a recent 454 page handbook
prepared by the U. 5. Bureau of
Labor Statistics for the VA, the
job situations in professional,
semi—professional, skilled, cleri—
cal and service occupations are
given a thorough going—over. In
all, some 288 occupations by
which Americans earn their liv-
ing, from the professions to far—
ming, are covered in the book-
let. . .

Data including chances for
employment, earnings, and qual-
ifications required, is given.

It you feel an uncontrollable
urge to fly, buy yourself a Cub
or, better yet, forget it. Accord-
ing to the booklet, both the
fields of airline pilots and host-
csscs arc overcrowded, as are
many other aviation occupations.

The same is true of news.
paper work, although “some
expansion in related fields is ex-
pected."

There are also more applicants
for FBI work than there are va-
cancies. probably because of the
low mortality rate since Cicero
was cleaned up, though the
booklet doesn‘t say exactly that.

If you really want to work,
though, there are several other
areas where opportunities are
excellent.

You can find a good practice
as a physician . . . if you can
get in medical school. There are
lots of jobs for teachers, librar-
ians, secretaries and automobile
mechanics. not to speak of bak-
ers, glass moldmakers, and meat
cutters.

Or you can go into farming,
though, as tho handbook warns,
“farming is not an easy occupa<
tion," what with the spring
plowing and fertilizing, and the
heavy work storing the lettuce
away in the bank vaults in the
fall.

If there‘s anything else you’d
like to know, the handbooks are
available to the public, at $1.75,
from the Superintendent , of
Documents, U. S. Government
printing office, Washington 25,

 

D.C.
