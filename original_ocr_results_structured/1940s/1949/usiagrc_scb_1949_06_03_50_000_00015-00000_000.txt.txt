iSEX SCANDAL IN COLLEGES‘
EXPOSED BY ARGOSY
MAGAZINE

Sex delinquency, growing at a
pace which threatens the hop
piness of every home, is found
today where it is least expected,
in American colleges, according
to a challenging article appear»
ing in the June edition 01 AR-i
GOSY Magazine.

The article, THE SEX SCAN-
DAL IN OUR. COLLEGES, was'
written by Patrick Mitchell af-
ter a two month research tour
which saw him visit thirty col-
leges, talk with hundreds of stun
dents, and consult educators,
divorce Court jurists, doctors and
psychologists

In discussing the story with a
ioium oi parents, clergyrnen and
doctors, Mr Mitchell Said, “Their:

pultant news, On what is happens

AN EXPOSE WITHOUT
INFORMATION
By w.

This is the sort of trash (see
adjoining column), along with
much other loose thinking, which
frequently brings colleges and
universities into a bad light as
lar as the American public is
concerned

In the first place, no scholar,

Marshon Del’oister

can visit thirty colleges, talk
with hundreds of students, con-
sult educators, divorce court
jurists, doctors and psychologists,
all within a period of two
months and possibly come up
with any objective answers to
the topic in hand. What probably
happened is that the investigar
toi had an idea that sex rs on
the rampage on college campuses‘
so he set out to K‘"plove Con-
clusions which he had already
reached,

The problem of sex behavior
undoubtedly is a problem on all
college campuses. There is no
indication, however, that the
problem has reached the pro.
portions which Mr. Mitchell in-
Implications from what
he says would lead to believe
that sex has just recently been
discovered on college campuses,
There are no data to indicate
that the average college student
today is any more loose in his
moral standards than his father
and mother who lived in the
,“Roaring Twenties" when every
i“l‘espectable” college boy carried
a ﬂask and made whoopie at the
slightest provocation—or without
provocation.

if by “sex delinquency," Mr.

Mitchell means that there is a
frankness and wholesome under-

sex in both the male and female,
then most educators rise up and
commend this trend rather than
denounce it. The ditriculty is
that many dischards cannot pres
