Eniorces
Drinking Ruling,
lloca’res Budge

“No drinking in rooms or on

college property,” is to be an
enforced rule, the C. of H. F.
ecided at a meeting last Mon-
day. In a “clamp down" opel‘r
ation fines will be imposed with
most cases expected to be “open
and' shut.”

Also discussed was the divis-
ion of the social fee. The'men’s
lia s’ allotment of $2,448 will be
di 'ded on a per—Capita basis.
Because of a decrease in en-
rollment the allotments will be
$40 to $50 less this semester
than last. Last year no hall had
less than $40 left in the treasul‘yi
a, on' this basis also it was felt
that the reduction is warranted.

Oi Room Assignmenl Ruling

The college rule that no room,
assignments will be made for
students requesting transcripts
for transfer to other schools will
be rigidly enforced in the tutors,
according to a recent decision of
thc pcrsoncll board.

In thc past too many studenisl
have paid their son dcposit fee‘
and reserved rooms, only to
withdraw reservation a I t c r
new students have already been
turnc‘d down for lack of room
and “old" students have been
kept on a waitlng list until late
in August or even into Seplelnr
her. This lull, for instance, twen-
ty wo girls who had signed up
for rooms did not comc back to
Grinncll, Since their rooms werel
reserved, new students who:
could have been accomodat'cdl
were not accepted.

 

The present ruling on page 71
of thc Grinncll catalogue statcs:
”No room assignments will be
made or held for students who
request transcripts for transfer
to other schools, except where
such transcripts are necessary
for admission to summer school.”
If a student requests a tranSA
cript bcforc spring room drawv
ing, the 360 deposit will not be
accepted. ll thc studcnt changes
his or her mind before room
drawing, hon vor, the $60 will
be accepted and he or she will
be allowed to draw. Students
who change their minds altcr
room drawing will be placed on
the waiting list for assignments
late in the summer.

This proccdurc will apply s
larly to those who request trans.
