Grinnellians Take Trophies

In I949 Nal'iona

Harriet Barnes, town sopho-
more, and Mary Pederson, class
of ’46 alumnus, recently won
tirst and third places, respective.
ly, in the lightweight division of
the Fourth Annual National 100‘
Mile Ride held at Oceola, iowa
on September 22, 23 ,2nd 24
of this year.

The ride was judged as a cone
test in which the horse and rid-
er covered 100 miles in an al—
loted time and finished with the
horse being in as nearly the
same physical condition at the
end of the ride as he was at
the beginning. The rider of the
horse that best fit these qualifi-
cations upun finishing the ride,
would be awarded the first
prize.

This year the ride was Called
“the clover-leaf“ since each night
the participants returned to the
starting point. On each of the
first two days they rode 40 miles
in six and a half hours. On the
third day, 20 miles was covered
in three hours.

Each day, the 27 horses ens
tered in the contest left the
starting point at SD-second inter
vals. Water was available for the
horses every five miles and sev»
erai stops were made each day
to enable the veterinarian to
check the heart beat and general
condition of the animal.

When Barnes and Pederson
checked in at noon of the third
day, they congratulated each
other on finishing the 100 miles.
They were even more suprised
and elated that afternoon when
it was announced that the former
~had won first prize, receiving two
trophies and $50.00, and the lat
ter landed in third place, win.
ning one trophy and $25.00.

To quote Harriet Barnes, “The
whole ride was thrilling, ex-
citing, and very stiffening.”

"It looks to us as it spirit on
campus is here to stay," said
cheerleader Dick Aams atter the
football game Saturday.

This opinion was veritied by
iCk’s Co-workers, Shirley Kine
ney, Nancy Scruby, Pearl Helm,
Bob Chapman, and Sibby Hsd~
ding. They all felt that the pres—
ence of a solid cheering section
i was a big step in the right direc-
‘ tion.

Adams has one explanation to
offer to the students. Often
lgroups started cheers on their
own, and asked the cheerleaders
why they had not led more
cheers. Dick points out that Con—
terence rules prohibit cheering
during actual play in a game,
and activity during time—outs is
{alternated between the cheer-
leaders and the band.
