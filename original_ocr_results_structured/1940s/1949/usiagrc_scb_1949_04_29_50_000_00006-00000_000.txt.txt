Board should resent it; although,
of course, Dave has a right to
his opinion.

Now, having been called a crank
and feeling somewhat twisted,
I feel compelled to putter a bit.
Despite his antagonistic attitude,
Dave and I can have no quarrel
about this thing, unlESs it is in
a matter of degree. I said that
as long as the women must
learn to spy on each other, they
should learn to do it Well. Dave
says that they do very well al-
ready. The point is_arbitrary,

Personally, I have an almost
sentimental fondness for iuss
ticc. To be almost radical on
the subject, I think that it
should be the ultimate goal of
law, In addition (I feel it nec-
essary to prod a few more
people to keep Dave Compally‘
—besides, there's nothing like
grinding at an old axe), any
law enforcement program that
depends for success on teach-
ing students to spy on each
other is short-sighted to the
point of stupidity. Anyone who
doesn‘t believe that should ape
ply for Teddy Bear Stuffing l
at Cooper school. .

There is a point that can be
made in favor of a no-liquor‘
rule~beyond drinking’s im.‘

cuiting effects. For too many
students think that one drinkl
entitles them to dismantle the
nearest wall, kick the rubble
into a heap, and walk over peo- ,
ple's shoulders on their way
out. Since drinking has taken a
more or less permanent hold on
our society, would it be too
heretical to suggest learning
right?

My remedy for the situation
would not be too glorious, hav-
ing little at my command but
common sense, As far as under-
age drinking goes, the state has
lawsklet it enfol‘CE them. Col-
lege scholastic standards Will
take care of the rest. If a stu-
