Mr. Herbert Miller of Chieago

that team.

“How we beat them I don‘tl
know. We didn’t have any-1i-

remember, we met the iowa boys
,at the train, took one look, then
hurried back tor more practice.”

“it was a rough game,” he
went on. “Back then we didn’t
have the downs system. We car~

him from crawling across the
goal line,”
