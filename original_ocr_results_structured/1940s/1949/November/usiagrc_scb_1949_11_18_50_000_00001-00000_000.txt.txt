evening on “The independent

After an introduction by Her—
bert Prescott (Journalism). Cole

wood independent on the has
oi experience with his own Co
liss Archer inovie. His major
problem was that of enterprise
.capital. Upon receiving a fifty
percent loan from the Bank' of
America, he was forced to
“prostitute" himself before
everyone to borrow “second
money,“ the other fifty percent.

F. Hugh Herbert maintained
that Hollywood is “greatly mal-
lgned.” Writers, actors and pr0e
ducers are actually very hardr
working people, he stated. The
much rumored orgies are none“
existent. though he felt that “an
iorgy every now and then would
be a good thing.” Discussing the
lporblem of writing a play, he‘
outlined certain basic points.
They are to write about the
familiar, to write simply, and to
igo to a competent professional
for criticism.

Several questions were asked

week. Talking firsi

+0 a convocai’ion
in Darby gym, she spoke
on 'Our Faii‘h in God,'
Thereafl‘er she spoke in

Herrick chapel on our

laiths in Jesus Christ,
Prayer, and the Church.

In her opening address, ”Our
Faith in/God," she outlined her
approach as a synthesis of his-
torical and emplrical techniques.
We must, she felt, study both
what men have fell. God to be
in the past, and the laws on
nature to discover What he is to
us.

Man

God

There have been four major

concepts of God in the Judcoe
Christian way of life:
God the Creator—not

Fundamentalist concept,

in the
but

rather in a sense of eternal
creation, a gift at purpose .in
.living.

God the Judge-not a God of
arbitrary wrath. More a Col‘iv
cept of an inner judgement of
worth.

God the Redeemer—Va promise
of deliverance from confusion.
Those who are, lost are" simply
bewildered and chaotic. God is
a redemption from the chaos of
temptation.

and the Father— Jesus took
the Old Testament concept of
God as Father and made it
central. God treats us like a
real father, with all the bounties
of lite around us,

Dr. Harkness emphasized that
faith should come from “the
bottom of our hearts" instead
of the utol: of our minds."

Jesus Christ

The authority for the Chris-
tian faith is found in the na-
ture of Jesus, for even those
who do not behave in Him do
not laugh at Him. Dr. Harkness
emphasized Christ in relation to
his cultureJJesus was a good
Jew—the greatest of the pro-
phets,"

She then discussed the major
teachings of Christ: God. the
rather, loves all men. Men
/S'hDuld live in love, Man is ever
prone to sin, .but is neverthEa
less of supreme worth.

The desideratum is to be of
inner worth. to, live in simplici-
ty.

The four essentials to become
ing a Christian are awareness
of need, surrender, acceptance
of obligations, and progressive
spiritual growth.

Man

The speaker opened with the
declaration that “unless we see
man in his greatness, we cane
not see God in His Holiness.”

There are four basic afflrrna«
tions to a faith in Man:

Man is both nature and spirit.
Natural man is mechanistic, but
in spirit he is of God.

Man is both free and bound.
gives him a re-
sponsibility—the power to choose
either good or evil.

Man is both sinner and po—
tcntially saint, sin is more than

 

ordinary wrongdoing, 'it is \n
disobedience to God.

Man is both transient and
eternal, His body is transient, but
his spirit is etcrnal.

Prayer

Among all the things the
world needs, the grcatcst of
these needs is an upsurg of
