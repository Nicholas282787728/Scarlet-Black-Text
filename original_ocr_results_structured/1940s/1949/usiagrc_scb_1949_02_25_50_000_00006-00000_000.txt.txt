College President
Calls for Relorm
Of Robo’r Sys’rem

In an article entitled, "Need
ed: A College Revolution,” now
appearing in the February Cor—
onet, Dr. Harold Taylor, presir
dent of Sarah Lawrence college,
calls for drastic action to reform
our “assembly line educational
System” and to “return to the
real purpose of liberal educa-
tion, which is to educate the in-
dividual liberally.”

Dr. Taylor, who contends that
the student is being cheated,
says “The problems will not be
solved until we double the num-
ber of teachers and until we
bring into the teaching profes-
sion the best young college
graduates. Only it we help the
student to find his place in so»

ciety, can we look to him for the

in a letter to the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service,
NSA rcouestcd that attention he
givcn to the emergency charac-
ter of the Chinese stlldents'
problem and pointed out that
the students are suffering as a
result or a government regula-
tion which requires that hold-
crs oi student visas can accept
employment only when it does

of a full course of study in day
classes.

NSA stated that this regula-
tion, under the present critical
conditions, is unrealistic and
prohibits many students from
engaging in adequate renumer—
ative employment in order to
supply their needs. It requested
that the regulation be waived
for the duration of the emer—
gency period for Chinese stu-
dents in critical need.

) to inves-
Chinese students in the United

States who have found themselves without enough money to live
as a result of the inflationary conditions in China_and the stop-
page oi monetary transfers to this country from China.

Savoretti, assistant Commission-
er of the Immigration and Natr
uralization Service, stated, “I
can appreciate the problems of
these Students and I realize the
disappointment they will suffer
if they are obliged to discon»
tinuc their studies and to leave
the United States because of
financial difficulties. The solur
tion that you propose, however,
. is not possible under the
present conditions.”

“I am not unsympathetic with
the problems presented, but any
further relaxation of the re»
quirements with regard to the
employment of students could
hardly be considered within the
Congressional intent expressed
in the statute governing stu»
dents.”

MT. Savorétti particularly
