GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK
MARCH 11. 1949

Button, Button. . . a

The student body, having had the opportunity to see
and hear eight candidates singly and in concert air the “is-
sues" involved in the campaign, has issued its mandate to
tile electoral convention. Whether its decision is a narrow-
ly—based, near-sighted olle, or one weighing all factors re-
mains to be seen.

Eight candidates have made as much political hay of
campus issues as possible (even considering the negative ap-
proach)—have promised everything from a head in the li»
brary to sweeping changes in student government and high—
er wages for student employees In many Cases, the means
to these ends have not been outlined.

Assuming that the Thursday vote is a wise choice, what
are a candidate’s chances of actually being one of the two
between whom the student must choose next Monday?

IF two candidates gamer 35% each of the delegates on
the floor, they are in. IF the instructed ballotithe first and
the only one which expresses the mandate of the entire stu-
dent body41early gives two candidates the necessary 35%
apiece, the convention will be short, and different from every
other convention within our memory. IF, as usual, no we
gain the required number (or only one does), the poli cal
shenanigans will begin in earnest. This is not to say that
politics hate not already been played.

The i a1 move—the one positive political move—prior
to the convention is known as “sewing up the delegates."
This operationiagainst which there is no ruleiis accomp»
lished by electing as delegates to the convention people from
every hall who are sympathetic to one candidate, The suc-
cess or failure of (his move is amply demonstrated by the
second ballot, for which the delegates are not instructed, i e.,
after having cast the first ballot as ordered by the election
board (reflecting as closely as possible the mandate of the
individual hall), the delegates are on their own, If the pro-
cess of sewing up the delegates” has been efficient, 35%
may be secured for a candidate who didn’t stand a chance
on the all-school vote.

Next comes “horse‘trading‘”7the “your-man-hasn’t-got-
a-chance, swing-your-votes-to-mine”7move, usually carried
out between ballots on the convention floor, or somewhere
close by. Buttonholing, fastztalking, circus demonstrations,
and what have you are all legitimate parts of pressure to
swing votes and abet “horse-trading" And when the pres-
sule bears ”nit (or when a candidate gives up voluntarily),
t h e "l-ni idraw-and-advise-you-to»cast-your-vote-to-Joe"
move takes place. i

There are those who believe the honest man doesn‘t
stand a chance. To some who keep their eyes open tomor—
row, that statement will appear as gospel. However, wheth-
er because of or in spite of the shenanigans, the eventual
choice has been a wise one in nearly every case

Whatever the outcome, don’t miss tomorrow’s conven-
tionl It‘s one of the few opportunities that Grinnell offers
to learn and have fun at the same time See you at 1:15

Letters to

March 8, 1949
To the Editor of the S 8: B:

The thousand dollar question:
Why. oh, why, did the Social
Committee throw one thousand
dollars of student fundsiearz
marked {or a “popular music
concert”—on a third rate dance
band like Tony Pastor’s? The
facts of the matter seem to in-
dicale that Andy Schlll, chair»
man oi the Gadabouts, in a hur-
rind meeting, persuaded the So-
cial Committee to sign a con—
tract with Tony Pastor for a
two hour “Concert.” The argu~
ment advanced by Mr. Schill
was that Tony Pastor was zvailz
able immediately for $1,000,
while Duke Ellington wanted
$2.200 plus 60% of the gate.
Moreover, Mr. Schill urged the
committee to sign the contract
with Pastor at once, since it was
a “now or never" proposition.

We realize that the ballot ter-
minology of ”popular music con-
cert” was ambiguous. However,
we, the undersigned, interpreted
it to mean a JAZZ concert. We
do not understand the complete
failure of the Social Committee
and Mr. Schill to make any at-l
tempt to determine the nature'
ol‘ popular student opinion on the

subject,
We do not understand why
Mr. Schill felt free to recom-

mend Tony Pastor Without hav-
ing investigated carefully all
possibillties involved 7 from
such organizations as Charlie
Ventllra’s, Pee Wee Hunt’s, and
Pete Dolly’s, to this garbage dis-
penser who specializes in such
trash as his arrangements of
“The Thousand Islands Song,”
and “Angelina“ In addition, we
object to this apparently Carer
less attitude of the Social Com-
mittee m hastily disposing of
pine thousand of our dollars,
if their taste in popular

even
music coincides with Mr.
Schill’s. .

Since Mr. Schill is a Campaign

manager for an aspiring Stua
dent Council president, and since
two members of the Social Comz
millee are also actively seeking
the job, it seems to us um some
explanation is appropriate if

 

ldent support.

To the Editor.

When the $3,000 surplus was
made known to the social andi
calendar committee at the close
of last semester, full investiga
tion was begun as to the possi-
bilities of obtaining such Vari-
ed groups as the Fred Waring
chorus, the “Oklahoma" com-
pany, and the Metropolitan opera
company. The Student Council
called a mass meeting early in
February, which was followed
by a ballot to determine exact-

we in this country enjoy. Other
countries have restrictions on

“A job opportunity,” Dean
Dearborn said, “must-' provide
conditions for your own growth
and for service to society.” Se~
curity and return don’i‘always
go together, and the highest
paying job may have the least
security, he added. Dean Dear-
born contended that we must all
set up our own standards of
good and bad and right and
wrong in reading, study, and
personal moral standards.
