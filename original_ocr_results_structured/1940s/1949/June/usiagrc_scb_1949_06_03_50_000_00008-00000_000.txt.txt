Ont e hapei Story...

The saga of Herrick cllupcl started in June 1048, With the bi:-

cinning oi the exterior renovation and terminated April 24, 1949,
when it was rcdedicatcd "to the worshm ot God”

in June at 1948 a noisy crew or masonry Cxper descended on
the campus and within a row days the chapel uas ripped of its
traditional ivv covering, Great green bundles or the stuti soon
uerc li-ing wrthercd on the ground, mute martyrs to the cause of
progress

The next step in the process was the replacement of dctcl‘lol'e
atinc mortar around the bricks oi the outer wallr A halt dozen
pneumatic chisels were put to the task of chipping away the
cruinbline ccincnt upon which time had begun to take its toll No
sooner- had the raucous clatter ot the chisels been stilled than the
air began to ring with the cry “mud!” as a crew of masons
swat-med over the walls,

The “new look" to); on the outside of Herrick was finished off
with new roofing, flashing, and extension of the side walk area:

Since then. the work has included replacing radiator heating
with a new hot air system, repltching the nave floor, and laying
new oak flooring, rebuilding the chancel and replacing old indi-
Vidtial seating With new, made to- or~der pews

Bronze chandeliers and ihcostat controlled lighting now illum-
inate evening servic - Painting has been done to carry out the
rnotit ot’ antique solidity. The red quarry tile in the ante chapel is
set of! hi a velvet runner extending to the altar behind which the
r~setedo stands i

The bascment of the rhino] has been dug out to install lest:
