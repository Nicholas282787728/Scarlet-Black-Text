Every coach yearns for one top-notch dream team during
his career—and that’s iust what Doug Mills, University of
Illinois’ youthful basketball coach and athletic director,
got this year. All sophomores last year when they took
the Big Ten championship, his Whiz Kids more than lived
up to advance press notices this season by producing some
of the most amazing basketball collegiate circles ever wit-
nessed. Playing in one of the country’s toughest leagues,
they ran through a ﬁgure schedule undefeated to re-
tain the Big Ten title, bowled over many other "outside"
college and service teams.
