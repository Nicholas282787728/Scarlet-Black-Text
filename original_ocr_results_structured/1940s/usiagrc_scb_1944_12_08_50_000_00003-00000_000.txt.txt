Pick a Pen Pal Now

Romance has often '[lolu‘lshed
under the guise of a three cent
stamp. Did you read about the
marine who wrote to the author»
ass of a poem he saw in a mag
azinc . , and two ycars later mar»
ried the girl? Or the lonely cen-
sor who tired of reading the love
letters of his men, picked an
address from the many that paSSr
ed through his otricc, and won
fair maid?

Realizmg the potentialities of
the pen, the Grinnell language
department has shouldered its
social responsibility and agreed
to find a pen pal tor all Grinncll
students interested. Said pen pal
may he Spanish or French, or
may just write the language. You
may even pick the country . . .
Panama, Peru, Ecuador . . , the
glamorous Latin nations, it you
go for that tropic inoon. Or it
you'd rather go European, lines
of communication with France
are now well established. Ale
though our linguists insist that
romance is not the object, a
squint at the bulletin hoard out-
side the language ottiee shows
a stunning majority of “boy" un-
der the heading “Correspondent
desired."

If you doubt your ability to
be glib in Spanish or French,
there are language dictionaries in
the libs, or course it might be
a little maddening to have to
spend all morning translating the
latest troin Enrique or Carlos or
