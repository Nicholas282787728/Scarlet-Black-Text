GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK
FEB. 4, 1949

i _What’s Your Hurry?!

“What’s your hurry”! There’s no place to go!" is 'fast‘

becoming the password of Grinnpll college students. 1

The problem of any mixed crowd is to find some place;
to go that‘s out of the cold. All we ask is a comfoi'tnble‘
place to Sit and talk, play bridge and listen to the radio. We,
used to have the Rec Room, but that’s a kitchen now. The,
Union, which is supposed to have taken its place, has not}
only become a men’s dorm hilt it is just large enough to‘
accommodate a slim percentage of the 1100 students on!
campus, The one ping-pong table is even a thing of thel
past. Loose hall lounge is closed and Main drawing roomi
is crowded, so it’s no surprise that the Little Theater is'.
rapidly gaining popularity.

It Seems r lsonable to us to extend open-parlor lloul'sl
to mixed groups until 10 p. m.. This way there would he
a radio to listen to, bridge tables to use, and easy chairs to
sit in. There we id be supervision either by the house-
mother or the 1: who “sits parlor" in Mom’s sllite. ,The
one thing standing in the way is the quiet-hour Yule, but
this also could he worked out. .,.The average group at one
time in each cottage lounge would probably never exceed
four to six, and that, you will agree, is a managable ll“n\-‘
hen The same quiet warnings could he issued and the
same campusing enforced that is carried on under the pres-
cnt system. I

As it stands now, a gentleman caller is not even per-
mitted to call his date from the housemother’s suite afteri
8 o‘clock. The onl available phone on South Campus is!
the one in Main cor 'dor. How many 9 o’clock coffee dates
does that accommodate? And it’s a little too cold to wait
for a date outside or in the loggia. It would be convenient,
comfortable and‘ sociable to be able to wait in the otherwise
seldom used parlor. ’

This plan would not work, however, unless the parlors
were treated with the same respect that living rooms in
homes are treated. We are adult college students. Can’t
we be given this opportunity, at least on a tworweek trial
basis? If not, why not?

ARGUMENTS’

Pro and Con

Do you hciicvc labor laws should protect individual workers in
the right to join or not to join a union—to remiin or not to re
main members—dust us they individually wish?

Ed. NoteiThe question was taken {mm a list of 18 questions cii»
culated by the General Electric Company. comprising a “Calm and
deliberate” examination or the ingredients that should make up a
new labor law. Far from being answerable by tile simple “yes"
or “no” called for, a great number of the questions were nebulous
or controversial, not clearly defining the issue or veiling a greater
issue behind a simple prerogative.

No. i believe _

1. Such prcVisloiis serve no
useful purpose and are included‘
with the sole idea of destroying
unionism. (chcvci, I would
not deny the necessity of pro
Vlslons which afford the indi id-
ual the righ’ .o redress in in l
stances wherein he feels agu
gricved.)

2. By such legislation we in-,
fringe upon the protection and
security which unions offer
their members under the closed
and union shop,

3. Such “individual" protec»
tion is not designed for the mil-
lions of workers who find union
membership beneficial, but rath-
er for those who deliberately,
choose not to support organiza-
tions which in most instances
are improving their terms of
employment.

Floyd Desch
Yes:

By answering in the affirmar
tive, I do not advocate complete
individuality in the determina-
tion of union status, for the
maintenance of the union shop
is indispensable as a security for
the laboring majority.

However, i see no justification
of the closed-shop ideology that
necessitates union membership
as a prerequisite of employment.
Such is discriminatory and a
denial of an individual’s right to
a you without encumbcringl,
union dues and initiation fees.

Furthermore, ‘thout some
guarantee of indi 'dual prefer-
ence, union progress itself may
be impaired. Where there is no
necessity for the union to sell
itself to the worker, the labor
organization is in danger of be.
coming a parasite, rather than
a social instrument for the betv
terment of the working man.
