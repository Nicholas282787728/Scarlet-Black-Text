0 College Without a Stag Line

There has been this year, miraculously, no
mention oi" the Social Problem; for which
no one can be more grateful than we. We
have always considered this campus a sin-
gularly moral one. For nowhere on earth,
we suppose, is there so water-tight a so,
cial structure. Where else but at Grinnell,
for instance, would it have been possible
for the director of social activities to ash
slllne the functions of a stag line? And
where else would his attempts have been
greeted with such surprise, nay even with
such righteous indignation?

We repeat, our campus is a singularly
moral one. We might even say there is
something medieval, some hint of the noble
single-mindedness of chivalry, in the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

gaged which is so nearly universal. It has
come to be considered indecent, or at least
insulting, to date a girl three times in SHC'
session without asking her to “go steady."

And so Grinnell remains practically the
only existing college without a stag line.
To be a model of decorum one must cone
fol'nl. Those who do not can only sit at
home and wait for the next women’s var-
sity.

0 Pretty Cheap Stuff

It was with some enthusiasm that the
Scarlet and Black gave its support to the
efforts of the campus Democrats and Rec
publicans and the PreeLaw club in staging
the political debate of last Friday night.

We still think it was a good ideaAbut
only a good idea.

That this pldiseworthy attempt should
result in such cheap stuff as issued from
the platform of Herrick chapel on Friday
evening is exceedingly regrettable. Most
oi" those attending the debate came with
the hope of heal" both the Republican
and the Democratic sides of the campaign
set forth in a reasonable, logical manner.
Although the gentleman speaking for the
Republicans made certain well-intended oil
forts to clarify the issues at stake, his at-
tempts to conduct an intelligent discussion
were submerged in the cheap emotionallsnl
used by his opponent.

It is true that this tear-jerking was
most ably done. But that does not alter the
fact that such all approach is suitable only
for the ignorant crowds ol’ the street corner.
For the Democratic representative to pitch
a supposedly intellectual debate upon this
level was not only exceedingly bad taste,
but it seemed a tacit admission of his in-
ability to discover and present purely logie
cal arguments for his partyian unl'ortulr
ate characteristic of altogether too many
politicians.

Perhaps the next time we are to be
treated to a political debate on the campus,
we shall have learned to exclude all emoA
