The Last Bugaboo-~-

ll' American youth entertain any doubts
about the seriousness of a world war, or
the part the soecalled babies of the nation
are playing in it, those doubts have been
wiped out by the government’s action of
Dec. 5, concerning reserve services.

The period of confusion which followed
the announcement, highlighted mainly by
the frantic efforts oi" some men to coin-
plete reserve enlistment, is a highly underr
standable result of such a sudden action
The buluarli of calm and purpose which
is already replacing it is a more laudable
one. In many ways, the elimination of this

last “out" is a fortunate move, considered,

from that viewpoint which is the hardest
for us non to achieve: “the longterm good."
First of all, this action clears the air.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DECEMBER II, [942

 

There isn’t any room for quibbling between
one service and another, or even the ad—
visability of enlisting at all. From now on,
college men are obviously going to do what
they’re told to do, and a good thing it i .
Energy which has previously been evaporat-
ing as conversation may be directed into
more usable channels.

Secondly, the war has become much more
real to every student on this campus since
last Saturday. We have been aware of the
emergency since even before Dec 7, 1941;
it is an insult to the intelligence of all per-
sons of the fighting generation to support
any argument of complete iner ’a on their
part. But, after all sorts of dire forebodr
ing, Grinnell this fall proved to be 'pretty
much the same place it was a year ago.

Estimates have been made about how
many men will be leaving before the end
of the year, No one knows how it fares
with the men already in reserve corpsi
But President Stevens has estimated that
half of the men now here will be gone by

March 15, that we may very well end this ‘

year with 350 students.

That’s not pretty. We probably won't
like it, But we‘re going to take it _ not
only because there isn‘t a doggoned thing
we can do about it, but because there is
a new kind of determination to come from
a fact squarely faced. Bugaboos don’t res
act well to strong light.

Light has been thrown upon the draft
bug-oboe by the action 01' last weekend
Further light on the fate of reservists will
come shortly. No stronger sun than the
president’s words could be shone on the
possible future of this college. Let’s take
off our dark glasses and look at that huge-
boo, too. Three hundred and fifty students
with clear vision and a definite purpose
can save any college, whether its enroll-
ment was 750 or seven thousand.

Critic Appraises Band Favorably;
Cltes Fine Balance, Tone Quality

By Burris Matthews

it was a better hand than last
year‘s that presented a forty-five
minute concert last Sunday, an
organization remarkable espcclnlr
ly for balance and tone quality.
The major numbers played by the
band, under the leadership of
Kenneth D. Simmons, were the
Fauchct Symphony in Brilat; a
Sibelius rhnpsody, “Onward Ye
People;” ”On the Trail" from the

Grand Canyon Suite, and a med- ‘

lev of Victor Herbert melodies.

Probably the most successful
piece was the symphony or Fall—

chcl, the ﬁrst symphony ever
written for concert bend, which
was played with s smoothness
the hand has not shown before.

The meaningful phrases of Si-
beluls were also outstanding on
the serious side, counterbalancing
the more popular Herbert tunes
and the mournflll donkey cries
of ”On the Trail."

“In spite of the lesser enroll-
mellt this year, the concert was
Very good," said David Peck,
Violin instructor and directbr of
the orchestra. "The tone Color and
the balance of the Sibelius num-
her were Well handled"
