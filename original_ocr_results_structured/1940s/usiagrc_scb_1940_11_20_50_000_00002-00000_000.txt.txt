0 Round—Up Comln’ Up

. A pleasant undercurrent of excitement and
anticipation can be felt on the campus this
week leading up to the Colorado Round—Up
day. One hears rumors of imported \vild
mustangs, silve handled six—shooters, and

buckskin outfits iresh from the wide open .

spaces of New Mexico. One sees the typical
Grinnell man reverting to the bewhl'skered
cowboy with his tenegallon hat r'ding‘ high.
But what exactly, you ask, is this Colorado

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Rollnd‘Up about which everyone knows so
much and yet so little

The primary purpose of Saturday’s l'es-
tivltles is to provide an .opportunity for
every Grinnell student to have a whee 01' a
good time. Starting with an all-school pep—
meeting in the morning, continuing with the
Grinllell—Colorado football game in the artery
noon, and concluding with the Dude-Ranch
Wrangle in the men’s gymnasium at night,
the theme of the entire day’s program will
be a good time gctetogether Western style,
The sophisticate l\'lll find little company ill
the student body bedeclied in glaring red,
blue and green checked shirts, cowboy hats,
dung-arees and boots. A RoundrUp Foreman
and Sweetheart, elected by the student body,
will be presented at hallltinlc of the game;
and at the same time, there will be '11] ex,
hibition of broncoebusting, bulldo p'ng and
the like.

01' almost equal importance, the other
reason for Round-Up is to show the right
kind of hospitality to the Colorado College
football team. Every member of our squad
who made the trip to Colorado Springs last
year feels a personal obligation to see that
the Colorado boys are enthusiastically \velr
comed and handsomely entertained. If we
lack the scenic beauty of Colorado, we can
make up for it by our genuine attitude at
friendliness and good will.

Too much emphasis cannot be placed on
the fact that this is to be an allecolleg'e
affair. Everyone can obtain a cowboy hat
for a nominal sum and everyone has the
ingenuity to dig up a reasonable facsimile
of cowboy regalia, Let's all leave our inn
hibitions at home Saturday, show the Colo—
rado team such an enjoyable time that
they’ll really look forward to coming' back,
and incidentally start the tradition of having
all annual “roundup” in truly memolable
style.

To the Editor:
By this time all ardent Zephyr

“Social Problem.” Frank collcgc

,nny cccd who will give a halts
hour of her White House time to
his discussion. In short, every
one is talking about it

To break the monotony, and
make myself further objectionable,
I should like to suggest that we

To the Editors:

The wave oi plcns and counter

have flooded the campus these

past few weeks have been nothing

particularly to us.

Believing that a sizeablc minor

wish to advance our “Plan to Encl

A Correction

In Saturday's issue of the Scarlet
and Black, it was erroneously
stated that the curriculum com-
mlttco had passed a. ruling shit»
ing that students- cntting the last
or first meeting of one or two
hour courses cl Thanksgiving- var
cation, would not be placed on
condition because of OVCl‘-C|lttlllg.

No ruling to lec effect was
passed by the committee Instead,
the matter was discussed, and the
above statement merely reflects
the opinion of the group.
