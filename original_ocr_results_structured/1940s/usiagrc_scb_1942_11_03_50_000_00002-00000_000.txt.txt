A Suggestion“-

Tha mythical colleague of yours and mine,
Joe College, Esq, has always had trouble
upon arising on certain bright and shining
Tuesdays, although any other weekday is
likely, to discover quite suddenly that he
has a traffic jam on his schedule for the
day of more consecutive one-hour exams,
not to mention minor quizes, than he could
possibly have prepared for.

Such a situation can be and has forced
the faculty to publish a full week in ad-
vance notices of intention to examine. Natv
urally, requirements differ in various col-
leges:~for some student bodies, only one-
hour exams need be posted, 'but others ask
that any folm of questioning taking more
than one»ha.lf of the class period shall be
announced, Publication is made either by
means of the campus newspaper in a regu-
larly maintained column or by a community
bulletin board. In any case, the failure of
a particular prof to publish intentions
means that students are automatically not
required to take his test.

This plan is not intended to frustrate
rugged individualism on the part of any
faculty members to make ignorance of the
law no excuse for both faculty and students.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

A faculty committee is appointed to act as
traffic cop by staggering the scheduled
exams when a pile—up threatens. Since
these commonsense methods have been
used to advantage ill other schools, they
might well be used here, at least experi»
mentally. Student Council and faculty
committees, attention!

Again The Whi’re House---

When? Where? Why‘.7 These questions re—
garding the White House are uppermost in
studnts’ minds now that the semester has
reached the half-way mark.

When will the White House be opened?
When we came back to school and realized
that all rumors were wellefounded, that the
White House now housed "military secrets,”
we were overjoyed to learn that a recrea—
tion center would be in existence in about
two or three weeks, We waited, Not many
complained after the first month, attributing
the delay to the general confusion and status
quo. Now we're wondering if many Grin-
nellians will have to leave in January with-
out.having known the friendliness of one
Grinnell’s strongest traditions during their
final semester.

Where will the White House be? It is
commonly thought that the Faculty club
was to be used for the purpose, But faculty
members and the Scarlet and Black staff
are comfortably settled there with no plans
to move in the very near future.

Why hasn't the White House been open-
ed? The expressed reason since the begin-
ning of the year is that no one has made
himself available to manage the con-
cessions. The provisions of the contract
are favorable since they assure the individ
ual of clear profit over the cost of the con-
cessions. Light, heat, water, and repair
work will be furnished by the college. If
a definite date were released as a deadline
for all applications, surely anyone the ad-
niiinistration may have in mind would re»

In the meantime, students are migrat-

overcrowded conditions, slow service, and
dissatisfaction all around

“However, this does not mean

I imagine the campus is nice to—

some old elofbes and take a bike;
you people still walking the ties
this year?

It's a funny lhlng how much we
want comfortable clnthes right
now; guess they help us relax and
feel a little more peaceful when
things are moving So qLuckly
around us. Have you noticed how
many of the casual clothes for
men and Women resemble each
other this fall? Men and women
alike are buying rough tweeds,
Zelan Windbreakers, Cravenette
ralnooats. covert cloth slacks, and
even a jacket styled after that of
the famed Commandos.

“Winter white" is a big thing
this year in fashions colorwheel.
White dresses, jackets, skirts and
Sweaters are in the spotlight at
the moment. They're not foo prac—
