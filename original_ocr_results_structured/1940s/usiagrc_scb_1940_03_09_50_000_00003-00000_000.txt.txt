The Student Survey—

Swee+ Music Tops Swing

~—By\Larg‘e Majority

 

AUSTIN, Texas. March 9.—Cur-
rent r-epors that swing music
has lost first place among dancers
are substantially correct, at least
among college students. They
have voted a preference for
“sweet" tunes by a two-tosone
majority in a nation-wide poll of
American campuses.

“which do you like best, swing
music, or the soecalled sweet
music?" was the question pre-
sented to a representative sam-
pling of collegians by the Stun
dent Opinion Surveys of America.

From the answers they gave,
it is evident that jitterhug music,
which took the country over last
year. is definitely out, for- the
time being anyway. Only 32 per-
cent declared they prefer-red
swing, while 66 per cent said
“sweet" music like that of the
Lombardos and the Kings was
their favorite. A small group of
2 per cent said, "Neither."

Men and women students show
practically the same preferences,
although there are more boys
than coeds who still like swing.
When the ballots were tabulated
by sexes, these were the results:

Men Women
Swing . 33% 30%
Sweet , . 64 69
Neither . s 1

Although the size of the ma-
jority varies from section to sec-
tion over the country, swing got
less than half of the votes every—
where:

Future Lincoln
In Senior Class

Miss Tod Finds

By William Buckley.

Abraham Lincoln in Illinois or
Abraham Lincoln in Grinncil, the
former is historic and lustrionie.
the latter is here in the flesh on
the Grinnell campus, according to
Phyllis M. Tod, secretary of the
appointment bureau.

thn J. A. Muth, sales mana-
gcr of thc Kath Packing company
of Waterloo, failed to show for a
scheduled interview Thursday.
eight prospective Kath salesmen
were left sitting in Dean Beatty’s
front office.

Upon the enlisting of the aid of
Miss Tod to solve the problem, she
suggested calling Waterloo to
learn whether Muth had forgotten
his appointment. Telephone calls
to Waterloo cost 40 cents and
each of the potential beef and
ham pluggers pledged himself to
pay five cents to defray expenses,

With the telephone call now a
matter of twosday-old history, on-
ly one man has kicked in to the
kitty. Shades of Honest Abel
