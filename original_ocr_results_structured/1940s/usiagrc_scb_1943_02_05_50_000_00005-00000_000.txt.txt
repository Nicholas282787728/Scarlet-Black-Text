Revised Plan
For Inframural

Games Ok'd

Each of Eigh’r Halls
Should Furnish One Team
Regardless of Changes

A definite workable plan for Con—
ducting intramural sports for the
rest of the year has been formulat.
ed by the intramural board, John
c. Truesdale, intramural director,
stated yesterday.

Because of impending changes
in the men's hall system. it seem-
ed necessary to establish a policy
which could foresee to some ex-
tent, hall changes and allow the
intramural program to function
as usual. he said.

In regard to the basketball sea-
son. it was decided that each of
the eight hall units should furnish
one team for competition. These
halls will continue to furnish ine
trainural teams, no matter where
they are living or regardless of
consolidation with other hails. If
the orginal unit rails to organize
a full team for the sport, because
of lack of manpower, all games
played by said team will be dis—
regarded completely in the stand-
ings, and the tournament will coll»
tinue with less units he said.

This policy will be followed in
regard to all intramural sports
for the rest of the school year,
and the’race for the Gardener
Trophy should be affected in no
way, Tniesdale, added.
