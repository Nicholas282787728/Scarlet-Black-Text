Everton

The following is an excerpt from
a letter written by Dr. John.
Scott Everton, dean of the chap-
el and associate professor of
philosophy,'now on leave of ab-
sence serving in India for the
American Friends society.

“You think my work is monot.
oneus? Not in the least, It is
a job chuck full of variety and
surprises, never a dull moment,
well, hardly ever! 1 have to do
everything from buying land for
an orphanage to planning the

center, to shopping for an arti-
ficial leg (for a war victim, not
for myself), to giving speeches
through interpreters, to negoti-
ating with officials, to planning
menus for our hostel, and so
on ad infinitum.

“It is
enjoy every minute

interesting work and 1

do of it

when I’d give a million if 1 had
it to be back in Crinnell, and
it will certainly look good to

 

be another feature of the broad-Y

work program for an industrial,

though, naturally there are timcsi

To Be Jewish Problem

Under the auspices of the Jews
ish Chautauqua society, Rabbi
Herman Schaalman of the Can»
gregstional Temple of Judah in
Cedar Rapids will speak in col-
lege chapel Thursday on “The
Jewish Problem in the World of

ture in a number of classes dur»
ing the remainder of the day.
Rabbi Schaalman was born in
Munich, Germany, coming to the
United States in 1935 on a

and ordained there, and won a
graduate scholarship in philosoe
phy. He has filled the pulpit of
the temple in Cedar Rapids since

"The Messiah“ Ott:
WMC Fails West

The annual Christmas presentae
tion of “the Messiah” will not be
given this year, according to J.
Forrest West, head of the music
department. Every effort was
made to get a balanced chorus
together, but shortage of men,
and the transportation problem
made it impossible.

“The choir will present its an-
nual Christmas program," pro-
fessor West said, “but the exact
date has not bccn decided as
yet."

BEHIND THE S

matic alts, when intelviewed
tlle cullent production of the

Saturday, December 2,

Few persons realize the “be-
hind the scenes” problems of a
major production of this type,
Mr. Andrews said. Before re.
hearsals begin, sets and cos-
tumes are planned to the small-
est detail. Lighting must be
worked out, color schemes de
signed, and authenticity of pro-
duction checked.

For “Ladies in Retirement,"
students of the dramatic pro-
duction class are doing the ac-
tual work on the costumes, sets,
and lighting.

Costnming .

"We never rent a costume," Mr.
Andrews said. The eighteen cos.
tomes in the play have been
made by members of the cos-
tume creiv. “Ladies
ment" takes place in 1885, the
“bustle era," and the most difflr
cult costume period in history.
A subtle aspect of dramatic cos-
tume design is the part that the
color of the costume plays iii
the characterization Each cos-
tume is designed to show the re-
IlationShip of the character With
the environment and with the
other persons in the cast. 1f
the player is in harmony with
the environment, as is Leonora
Fiske, the victim of the murder,
her costumes harmonize with
the set and with those of per—
sons in the cast who are sym—
pathetic to her. if the player is
an interloper who is out of.har-
niony with the environment, and
with the other players, as is the
murderess, Ellen Creed, her cos-
tumes will clash.

“This costuming must be sub.
tly done, and the method .must
not be too apparent m the au-
dience, Mr, Andrews said. "If
not handled carefully, it be»
comes too noticeable, but if the
costumes are not designed on
this principle, the audience will
feel that something is missing."

sidc: You can tell orinnell girls
that when they wear their shir‘t
tails outside they are not adopt-
ing a modern fashion but one
that has been the style in India
for forty years or more.

“The children, up to the age
of six or in some cases to a
much later age wear nothing but
a silver anklet or a bracelet,
Those who have any extra mun-
ey, instead of putting it in the
bank, invest it in silver and
gold ornaments, earrings, ank-
lets, bracelets, etc, so that if a
person has mnsidcrahle saved
he is rather weighted down with
ornaments. Many of the women
wear an ornament in the nose 7
which 1 do not regard as very
attractive!"

Dr. Everton also added in his
letter that he would enjoy hear-
ing from oriimell students. His
address is: J. S. Eevrton, AFSC,

THERE'S LIFE APLENTY

after,” stated Kent Andrews, assistant professm of dra-

drama department. The psy-

chological melodlama will be presented at a war bond
showing on Friday, December 1, and a regular Showing on

Staging

The stage crew, like the cos-
tume crew. plays a major part
in the production. Members of
the stage crew build the set, at-
tend to lighting effects, and see
to backstage duties during the
pertormance. The all-girl crew
has learned to handle power tools
in doing die carpentry for the
set, Since the eccentric Miss
Fiske of the play had a fondness
for the Tudor period, she had
her house remodeled in that
style. The set designers went
,to this period for their models.
In the college production, the
fireplace and several other fea-
tures of the set are actual copies
from Ann Hathaway's cottage,
and the stairway is reproduced
from one in an old Tudor castle
in northern England.

The fireplace illusion which
has appeared in several produc.
tions of the drama department
will again be used in this one.
It is achieved by a weird combir
nation of switches, red, yellow,
blue, and green light bulbs, an
electric fan, and colored chiffon,
Mr. Andrews revealed. Its op-
eration requires the full time of
a member of the stage crew du‘r’
ing the entire performance.

Back Stage Duties

Each crew member has a back-
stage duty during the presen-
tation of the play, The clock-
work smoothness of the play
depends partly upon the execu-
tion of these duties, in which
each crew member is as well
trained as the actors are in
their parts.

Those
tulning are:

in charge of the cos-
Dorothy Dose, Shir-
ley Spencer, Phyllis Kistier,
Shirley Dihel, Charlotte Bram
nen, Marjorie Blumenschein, Vir.
ginia Jennings, Margaret Ber-
ry, and Barbara Takahashi.

Members of the stage crew
are: Phyllis Pincus, Sue Norton,
Elizabeth Johnson, Marilyn
Green, Betty Ami Sharp, Con-
stance Raclin, Alice Powers,
Lonabelle Kaplan, and Margie

A change in the conditioning pro-

uounced today by President

With the beginning of the sec,

Gymnasium requirements for
senior women were previously:
four periods of either gymnasi—
um or conditioning up until
spring vacation. after which on-
ly two periods a week were re-
quired

This does not mean that se —
iors need no more athletic activ-
ity, Miss Anderson stated, but by
this time they should be able to
’ plan for themselves. They will
still be expected to participate
Iin intramural sports.
