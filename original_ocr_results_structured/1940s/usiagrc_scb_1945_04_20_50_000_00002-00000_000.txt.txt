Many Happy Refurns - -

(Editor’s Note: This editorial
is reprinted by special request
from the April 21, 1944, issue
of the arliniell Scarlet and
Black.)

Dear. Adolf:

Before we start we must apolo-
gize a bit for this letter. It isn't
quite what you expect, perhaps,
on this, your 55th birthday, and
7believc us7 it isn't exactly
what we would like to send you.
But because we back here can’t
be there in person to present your
birthday remembrance, we want
at least to explain what it is
going to be and why it may be
delayed .....

It scarcely seems possible that
this is the tenth year in which
we have known you well enough
to mark your birthday7and even
less possible that in our own
ignorance it has taken us so long
to realize just what the appro-
priate gift for you would be. But
now we think we have it7-the
ideal thing, and we trust the
completeness of this year's me—
morial will make up for the in-
adequacies of the past. . . .

It is from the men who didn't
get off the Dunkirk beach, and
from those who had to leave them
there. It is from thirty thousand
people who lived in Rotterdam,
and the thousand 'who starve each
day in Greece. It is from stud-
ents in Prague and Oxford and
the Sorbonne and Grinnell, Iowa.
It is from everybody everywhere
who like Mendelssohn and Thomas

Mann and who think Albert Ein-l

stein should be able to shout his
head off even it most people
don't understand him, It’s as
pecialiy from people who think
a man should be able to shout
his head off even if most people
do understand him and don't like
what he says. This is from Meth:
odists and Buddhists and 5091104
'more students of philosophy; from
farmers and pharmacists and
movie stars. Part of it was made
in Detroit and part at Alameda.
Calif, and part on the river
Clyde. A lot of it came from a
city called Steel and some of it
we think was carried a thousand
miles to Chimking—maybe you
didn't expect that, but it's in
there. . . .

What we've got for you is a
pretty big thing, Adolf. We hate
to make you wait, but we're tak-
ing it easy to insure perfect de-
livery7when it gets there you'll
see that it makes up even for
ten years of neglect.

A very happy birthday, Adolf.
If, by any chance it should be
your last, we want you to know
that we aren't sparing anything
to make this one serve for a
long, long time. We let you pick
out your own present for many
years7BUT THIS ONE'S 0N Us!

and that's a pretty comprehen-

nel office seems to have an ef-

few months Miss Dorothy Osborn
and, Dr. Geolge Lovell have been
working on a so-cclled catalog
of the senior class.

' The finished list gives the stue
dent's major, his minor or min-
ors, his vocational interests, and
a paragraph listing some of his
outstanding activities on cam-
pus, various people's evaluations
of his worth, and some of his
character traits. In general, cacii

“On again, off again" seems to be
the general rule where Virginia
Foote is concerned (more ways
than one, we might addl. We re-
fer specifically to the liklihood
of her attendance at the Pine
lTrce party come Saturday night!
‘ The idea's a good one [take it}
ifroni us) but an especially
cold night 7 and a very wet
ground aren't the most comfort-
ing climatic conditions for a
blanket party. Could be Jean
Slierrf was oblivious of every-l
thing but her “one and only."

See what comes of concentraci
ing on the local talent 7 when
“Drummer Boy" Krupa gave the,

Board of publications.

hundred businesses, industrial
concerns, and professional organie
zations all over the United States.
While it would be impossible to
contact all the small schools, even
in 1owa alone, teaching centers

material, too.

Second Phase

When a company returns the
enclosed blank, indicating an
inter-est in some ot the descl'ipe
tions, the second phase of the
Personnel office's work begins. A
second, more complete survey of
the student is sent the prospects
tive employer. This includes a
complete list of all the courses
completed (with no grades given),
a complete list of campus activ-
ities, a full statement of counr
sellors' and professors' evalua-
tions,and any other material that
the Personnel officc has on file
and considers pertinent.

At the same time, the senior
will be inrormed oi the job open-
ing'so that he may apply if he
so desires. In this way se iors

in which they may be interested,
and business organizations will
have a chance to more easily sin.
gle out applicants for any posi-
tions they may have open.

The first step of this place-
ment program gets underway this
week, with the mailing of the
catalogs and accompanying ma-
terial. Results should be coming
in all during the next month, so
that by the end of the school
year all seniors wiu have received
