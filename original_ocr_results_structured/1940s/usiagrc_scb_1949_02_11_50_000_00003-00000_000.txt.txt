Three Scarlet and Black var-
sity teams will iourney to Carle—
ton tomorrow, as the basketball,
wrestling, and swimminginvade,
ers set themselves for the trip,
to the Carl stamping grounds, ,

Coach Pfitsoh and his men will
get back into the swing of
things after a three week layoff.‘
Two-scrimmages with the fresh
man squad have given the val»
sity a feeling of actual playing
conditions.

The Pioneers ot only have
carleton to woi v about, but
also find themselves confronted
with four games in one week.
Though beaten here Jan. 15, 60-
50, the Carleton team is known
to be a hard team to beat on its
home court. ”Knox, Lawrence,
Monmouth, and Carleton are all
still very much in the race to
dethrone Beloit as conference-
champions," said Coach Pfitsch.

The Scarlet and Black swim-
mers, helped by the return of
last year’s ace diver, Bob Noyce,
expect a hard meet when they
tangle with Carleton. Legg, Zeit-
ler, Jessen and Risse in the 4am
yd. free style relay have been
steadily improving,

Belolt recently defeated the
Carleton tankmen, and Coach
Slaughter realizes that “the wine
nor of tomorrow's meet will be
one of the top contenders" for
the conference swim crown when
the Midwest entrants converge
here Mar, 4-5 for the conference
ineet.

Bud Gregg has recovered from
his injuries and will join his
seven mat—mates tomorrow. Grin-
nell will be out to avenge two
year—old setbacks and also set
the stage for a return match
with the Carls a week from to»
morrow here in Darby.

fore the two teams meet: I'm
thinking specifically of Law

the second time Mar 4, the
night before our Pioneers in-
vade the Gold home grounds.
Who knows, two games in sucel
ccssion might prove disastrous
to the Beloit—nien. Anything can
happen, and let’s hope it does!!!

The Kellyemcn rrom Rawson
and Langan remain undefeated
in intramural basketball play, in
the A league, Langan’s Joe Yeck
is second in scoring, following
closely on the heels of Jerry
wright from Gates. Mel White,
on Rawson’s B team, and Jim
Kissene, Smith's forward, arc
the leaders on the othcr side of
the gym. Looks like its going to
go right down to the wire since
the tivo outfits don't meet until
the last scheduled game on the
card. Better flip a coin. ’Cause
it promises to be a close one.
