GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Counselling Sys’rem Slresses

Sl'uclenl's Persqnalil‘y: Lovell ,

“We feel every student has the
right to be known as a per-son,
not as student K," said Dr.
George D. Lovell, director of
personnel, in explaining tht calms
selling system on this campus.

To fulﬁll this purpose, 26 four
ulty members, including every-
one from instructors, to depart
ment heads, to the college dean
himself, act as counsellors and
advisers to every Grinnell stir
dent. An entering freshman finds
himself assigned to a faculty
counsellor who has been picked
by the director of pc--oniiel after

a thorough study of the student's,

application blank, In his junior
year, the student is transferred
to the head of the department
which includes his field of con-

FASHION
FLASHES

By Anne Hellebusch

with a quick glance at Grinrl

nell fall fashions, anyone can see
that reconversion has set in. Peri
haps it is because of the in-
creased number of males, (per-
haps, she 592!) but at any rate,
this year's cored is clothes—cagey.
Yes, indeed-y.

No longer are the inevitable
jeans worn shamelessly to class-
es, nor do we streak for break-
fast with the collar of our pa»
jama tops sneaking out of a
hastilyrﬁonned sweater. Instead,
the new, nipped in waist effect
is being favored, and it is even
being achieved with the prosaic
skirt and sweater. Large; hands
some leather belts such as the
fringed, rawhide one sported by
Phyllis Pincus are adding dash
to many waistlines,

/ Skirts have taken a turn from
the pleated, “cheer-leader" type
to straight lines, side drapes, and
vfringe interest. (Have you seen
the checked job that Diana En-
gelken has? Take a look then!)

Necklines are also becoming a
focal point in fali‘fashions as
seen in the swing toward coolie
collars, turtle-necks, (yes, he
does!) and cutout interest, The
soft flattery of a turtle-neck colr
lar is mighty smooth, and Max-
ine Hay proves it in her white
blouse.

So-o-o, “Sloppy joes” are still
here, and we’re convinced that
nothing can take the place of
our beloved saddles; but the new,
trim fashions are guaranteed to
lure a man or even rouse at
twinkle from the eyes of your
's:uo a. m. prof!

Mrsr Curley Returns

M-rs. Curley, who disappeared
from San Francisco Sept. 18 and
was reported drowned, was lo-
cated in Mexico City, Mex, Sept.
29 by her father, and flew with
him to Des Moines from Mexico

more, who broke her leg last
Friday aftemoon in the swim—
ming pool while diving, is in the
Community hospital in Crinneli.

Miss Florence Swan, R, N,, said
that Miss Watts has shown good
progress and her doctor hopes
to put a cast on soon, so she

auguroted in Crinnell college in
1942. by President Samuel N
Stevens and Dean of Men Shelr
ton L. Beatty. .At that time
such an advisory system was a
new step, used in few other col-
lcges,

Every year steps have been Lak-
en to make this college‘s pro-
gram more upstardate and flmve
icss. On September 11 and 12,
this fall, all counsellors met to
conduct an extensive survey of
a counsellors duties, to famil»
iarize themselves with the qualr
ifications and objeclecs of the
college, and to review the facing
ties and offices of the college
which are available to each stu-
dent, such as the health sel‘vicei
the deans' offices, or the speech
clinic.

They alsoi acquainted them-
selves more thoroughly with tho
testing program used for new
students, so they couldrbcttcr exr
plain the tests and interpret the
results.

Any faculty counsellor might
well have been as uneasy at the
first lnterVieWiwiUl one of his
counsellees as the student him-
self, except for the discussion
held by the counsellors consider-
ing methods of interviewing that
‘would set both parties at ease.

These counsellors' discussion
groups will be continued monthly
throughout the year to assure'
the continuation of a smoothly
conducted and beneficial Counsel»
ling system on this campus.

S’revens Reveals
Decordiion Plans

ln Herrick Chapel

Herrick chapel will be com~
pletely redecorated and the organ
will be rebuilt and enlarged, it
was announced today by President
Samuel N. Stevens. These plans,
to be effected by next May first,
were set in motion this week by
ordering of the necessary mater-
ials, Dr. Stevens said.

A high alter and reredos are to
be built directly under the stained
glass window at the back of the
chapel platform. The platform
will be enlarged so that the cen-
ter aisle wdl run directly from
‘the rear door to the alter. and
the present seats will be replaced
by pews. Two enscrolled wooden
partitions will screen the doors on
either side of the platform.

A passageway running under
the chapel from a remodeled
choir room to the rear entrance
will enable the choir to enter the
platform from the center aisle

To permit closing off of the
alter when non-religious programs
are being held, a dark red velvet
curtain will be hung from the
arch above the platform,

Chatanooga, Tenn., where he
was working in a mill, attending
school, and singing on Sundays in
the choir of a colored church,
Professional singing meant “jazz"
to him until by chance he heard
recordings of Sembnch. Eames,
and the tenor, Caruso. Speaking
of his pivotal experience later,

‘as though a bell rang in my

From this time forward, one

of training, struggle for ex

through until he stands many as
one of the greatest Negro toners.

Speaking of a Hayes concert
in New York City, the late critic,
Heywood Brotm wrote, “I saw
a miracle in Town Hall. Half of
the people who heard Hayes were
black and half were white; and
while the mood of the song held
they were all the same."

ble senior, Helen Webster, Haines
junior. Peggy Trcgillus, Read
iunior and Ann Royal, Haines
sophomore. Neal Snortrum, as
president of the freshman class,
will be present in all cases cork

An amendment to change the
constitution of the Grinnell col-
lege honor system was approved
by more than the necessary three
fourths of the student body. The
proposed amendment would
change the penalty for a first
violation from N, c. in the
course to N. C. in the test. Apr
proval by the student organiza-
tions committee and the faculty

ment can be added.

In conclusion, William Findley

of the whole student body in
what he believed was a good,
new development on campus.
Miss Buckley seconded his plea
and added that the honor court
would take a positive view of
