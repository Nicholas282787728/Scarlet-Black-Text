Students and Politics

Now that the shouting is all over we can
look back upon the Student Council Presi-
dential election with a certain degree of de-
tachment and perspective.
Most of us will agree that tlle new cons
. vention system and the central polling place
were highly successful.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

But as we look back upon the whole cams
paign, we remember some statements and
attitudes expressed which indicated a de—
plorable lack of appreciation for the practi-
cal affairs of life. When a comparatively
large group of individuals believes that not
only the convention, but the whole campaign
and student government in general is just
a lot of crude kids‘ play, it makes us won-
tler if anything has educational value for
some people

Strangely enough, those very people who
collsider themselves to be too refined and
sophisticated to take an interest in campus
politics are the very ones who think it is
the school’s obligation to coddle and protect
them. They are the perennial cynics and
gripers. They do nothing.

If some of the people who believe that
politics are vulgar and politicians are screws
balls would get into’ activities around here
and make an attempt to clean things up,
we would all he better off, But perhaps
these people lack the courage to do more
than act bored Feigned superiority and
aloofness are pitifully poor substitutes for
courage.

These are times when people are going to
have to face facts—or else. Society has lit-
tle sympathy for the individual who can not
face reality Regardless of the mud-slings
ing, the machines, and the petty prejudices,
politics are here to stay. The sooner \l‘é
learn to realize that the affairs of the world

‘can not be run from the sacrosanct close’t

of the incurable idealist, the sooner politics
and government can be refolmed and, "'
need be, replaced. We question whether
there is a better method of learning the
mechanizations of the political world than
by actual practice.

percent of the net profits of the
production. The remaining 30
percent of the profits are to go
into a joint iund, controlled both
by the Friars and the Student
Council. If, by spring vscstion
next year, no plans are made and
approved for disposal of the
funds, they will be turned over
to the Student Council, Young
said.

Additional approval of the
plnns will he sought this after-
noon when vsrious students will
meet with the social committee.
it was said that Pres. samuel N.
Stevens will attend the meeting.
rlnns Are Temporary.

Young cmphssized that these
plans are only temporary ones to
be used this your, and that the
entire setup may he changed next
year.

The Student Council also dis-
cussed plans to form an organiza-
tion which would be responsible
for the staging of an allrstudent
production every year. “It would
be similar to the Princeton Tri-
sngle club,” one member stated.
However, nothing definite was
done by the group on the matter.
To uni-c Manngon

It was agreed that the busi-
ness manager for the musical
show would be named jointly by
the Friars and the Student Courh
cil.

Naming of the business man-
ngsr- lvlll probably be done after
spring Vacation at the next meet—
ing of the complete Student
Councd.

To the Editor:

Now that the election is o'iEr
and We have chosen the presi-
dent of the Student Council, I
am curious to know what pos-
sessed the women on our campus.
Did they think the fellows were
running over them or did they
have some notion that they were
receiving too little recognition
from the dorms?

With posters in various places
around the Quad reading “Give
ihc Dorms a Scare" and the
League Board’s ruling that the
women were not to know the re-
sults of Thursday night's “In-
struction” vnic until Saturday “so
that the valuable information
would not leak out to the west
side of the campus," a. dox'mite
like myself wonders just what is
going on inside of the closed
doors of the Qusdrangle.

“more did those rumors origi.
note that were being spread shout
the candidates? \\'(:re the was
men as gullible as they seemed to
be or were they merely grabbing
every preposterous sci-hp ofpropa—
gondn in a feeble effort to
strengthen their weak arguments
for their iiivorioo candidates?

The women saly they deplore
machine politics, yet. to my way
of thinking they were the ones
responsible for the evils of ma-
chine politics. 1f when they heard
a rumor, they had been quiet
about it and let it go no further
Lhey would have gone a long way
towards stopping tbcsc deplorable
tactics.

#Russell 0. Craig

(Ed, Notechre there any ma-
chine politics present during the
campaigns? We doubt it.)

Amherst, Mass.
To the Editor;
We of Amherst are glad to hear
that there is one part of our
grand and glorious America as
yet untaintcd by the blot of
civilization and which still retains
its pristine pride. And from con-
sultation of our nuns we find
that even as Boeotia was ad-

mitted to the fellowship of the
Hellenic union, so has the gift of
citizenship been bestowed upon
the inhabitants of the Iowan
Territory.

For that our fathers have build.
ed us lodges or safety and rest,
which we are wont to seek rams
er than the dubious safety of
the smoked-holed .,wig-wi:m and
the blue dome of the ﬁrmamcnt.
even so shall we continue in the
practice of our iorbesrs, and con-
tinue the conduct of our Bac-
chnnulin in the secluded, but sale,
conﬁnes of our fraternal com-
pound. Do you now seek endow-
ment nnd build for yourselves,
sum as have we, n refuge
’gnjnst the elements of the sun-
parciicd plains; for such is the
duty of man.

Let us here remark that wc
iirmly intend to continue stead~
fast in our custom of maintain-
ing our canvivialities on a gentle~
manly and urbane plane, though
from afar we may appear pain-
ed and restrained. MEN OF
GRINNELL! How the devil can
you of the West be other than
we, who lack our Amys, Flor-
elices, and Esthel‘s (o. T.)’.’

Hoping for your salvation, we
remain, sir. your most humble
and obedient servants.

These three merchants, who, to-
