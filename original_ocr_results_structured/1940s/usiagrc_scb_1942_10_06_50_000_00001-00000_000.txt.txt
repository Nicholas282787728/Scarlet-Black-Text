Yankees Lose Series

To bet or not to bet~that was
the question. And now that the
World Series is over, one Grin-

are either rich or poorer as a
result of the Cardinal's victory.

Most talked-about casualty is

Paul Boat, noted campus specular
tor, who lost a shirt and tie to
Jack Bailey, and bid a forced
farewell to 12 of the Boat fam»
ily’s hardearned dollars, Boat
plans to hold a rummage sale in
an effort to get out of debt, after
which, rumor holds. he will retire
into a barrel till cold weather
sets in.

Two of the happiest men on the
Grihneu campus tonight are
George Walker and John (“Bink”)
Barnes, who are each as to the
good, having collected on St.
Louis. Exactly what they plan
to do with these fabulous sums
has not yet been decided.

league pennant race and on the
World Series.

Md, addressed a special chapel
meeting Monday morning while
on campus to inspect the second
A. G. o. officer‘s candidate school
here.

Crisis of Peace

”This country's young people
are her most valuable source of
reserve power, but they will never
be needed in the crisis of war as
they will in the crisis of peace.
Their function, as that of any
of reserve force, is to consolidate
the victory when the battle is
oven

"I ask you not to throw this
tremendous reserve power into the
war before the battle has even
started.”

Pointing out that the war itself
is only a limited front, Col. Hold-
ridge said the real “duration"fol'
which college students should pre-
pare is not that of the war, but
of their lives.
