Madole Maintains High
Siancling, Deflaling
Lash by ZO-IB Score

Once more the college five fell
to defeat under- a rather over»
whelming- score. Again it was
a simple case oi kids who like
to play basketball playing
against a fast, tall, cagy army
outfit.

The Macy boys were unable
to make their passes good the
few times they got control of
the ball. The army would soon
intercept a pass and a beautls
tully worked fast break would
completely crush a slow-to-reaet
college detense.

On two or three occasions, the
college offense would work
beautifully, giving a hint of po-
tential possibilities. but the
clvies’ inability to sink a basket

On Thursday night, the high
riding Madole outfit almost failed
to maintain their reputation as
they nosed out Lash's team by
a score ot 20.13 One of Mite
dole’s high scorers. Moushey, was
unable to sink a basket due to a
recently dislocated shoulder, Be»
tore the game there seemed
little doubt as to who would be
the winner, but the flashy speed
displayed by Lash and Co kept
the league leaders hopping all
the way to keep their top stand-‘
ing and their unblemished rec-
ord.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Duke Hoping --

G. Lester Duke yesterday after
noon issucd a call for all civilian
men interested in going out for
a track team Duke made it

enough talent to till out a full
team but he was interested in
developing a relay team to entei-l
in various meets, especially the,
Drake Relays.

A certain amount of track ex-
perience is spread rather thinly
among Keith Olson, Bill Fox.l
Tosliio Uycda, John Dooley, Ted
Stanirord and Bob Moyskens.
Apparently the best bet lies on
developing a halt niilc relay team
or {our men, each running 220
yards. Two of the ones inen-
tioiicd above are interested in
cross country ,or the distances,
but their small number makes it
impossible to hope for a distance
