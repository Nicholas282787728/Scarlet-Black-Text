S’rhpeech!

By Stuart Roeder

Cuessth what?! Do you know
how I sthpsnd an hour a week?
Do you know that I and nine oth-
er people like me sthpend foiir
periodsth of fifteen minutesth ev—
ery week in a sthpeech clinic. All
ten of usth have sthome sthort
of sthpeech difficulty which im-
pedesth our facthiiity of stpeech.
I have a thick “5th."

Well, anyhow, I figured that as
long as I was going to have to
spend a lot of tune in the pur.
suit of this particular endeavor
I'd find out a little more about
the department behind it. The
speech department sponsors the
speech clinic. Oh, I guess that’s
logical, though.

SC 1 toddled to the little room
that serves as an office for Mrs,
Velma Hiser, instructor of speech,
and Mr. John Ryan, professor of
speech and head of the depart-
ment, determined to get the who,
what, when, where, why and how
of this business of learning how
to talk.

Fifteen minutes after I wont
toddling into the cubicle I came
wobbling out, snowed under
sheaves of literature on the Grin.
nell speech department. Consci-
entious character that I am, I
straggled home and my, my what
I didn't learn about our speech
department.

Did you know that Grinnell was
among the first to organize a
speech department. Here’s an-
other first for Grinnell, too. Grins
hell was the first to suggest and

use the word “speech" as the
name of the department. This
name and general organization
has been adopted by all the oth-
colleges.

The aims of the department
are listed as: (1) the develop
ment of personality and confi~
dence through good speech; (2i
development of ability to speak
so as to become a better student
and a leader; (3) education of ins
dividual to speak ably in public
and private; (4) a solid founder
non for those interested in ra-
dio; (5) improve the voices of the
15% of college students which
a poll shows to have defective
voices; (6) aid speech defectives,
which plague 4% of students.

The speech clinic is open to
any college student ,though it is
a nonrcredit course. The rest
or the offered courses are listed
in the handbook and range from
drama to argumentation.

To encourage speech students
there are the numerous contest
awards, The Hill prizes were
originated in 1891 and are be
lieved to have been the first of
their kind in the country. The
Spaulding prizes are for inter-
p‘retative oral reading, Informar
tion on these contests and the
courses can be obtained from the
department . . .

Well, right about there my ad-
itor busted in and got me all
confused and I'm back on my
thick “sthsth” stho I better stiitop
before you sthtart doing it.
It’sth a very contagiousth prac-
ticthe. try it sthometiine,
