Presenting the foreign policy of
each of the presidential candi-
dates, Doris Popple. Haines sen~
ior, told the League of Women
Voters Monday evening that the
national administration elected in
November must take a respon-
sible part in world cooperation,
She listed the following “essen—
tials to peace”:

1. A. national administration
tn world cooperation. lessening
of trade barriers, financial sta.
bilization and cooperation with

'other powers to faciliate ex-
change in goods and currency,
and a world outlook; instead of
a viewpoint built upon “Amere
ica First."

2. A domestic policy that
will provide political and econ-
omic security, and a liberal con-
gress which will realize its re-
spunslbility toward other na-
tions.

Miss Popple read quotations

from speeches by President Roose- ,

velt and Governor Dewey which
indicated that. although Dewey’s
policy is now substantially the
some as the pX‘ESIdenL’s, Mr.
Roosevelt had been in favor of
lend-lease, national conscription,
and other preparations for war at
a time when Mr, Dewey was op-
posed to them. However. she emv
phasized that, since the League
of Women Voters is a nunepar—
tisan organization, she would wel-
come criticism for her conclusA
ions.

Among other requisites for a
peaceful world settlement. Miss

Are you color blind? Do you
know the principle behind motion
in the movies? How good is your
eye. hand, and foot coordination
while driving a car? Grinnell is
one of the few small liberal arts
colleges which lets
work out laboratory problems
such as these in its beginning
psychology course. This plan was
started by L. c. Douglas, pre-
vioiis head of the department. who
felt that beginning as well as
advanced classes should have ace
cess to the well-equipped psy-
chology laboratory.

The development or psychology
as a separate field in the cur-
riculum of colleges and univer-
sities is comparatively recent.
Prior to 1900. it was merged
with the education department,
,and before that it was considered
as a part of philosophy.

The psychology department of
Grinnell feels that its chief obli-
gation is to give courses which
are of immediate value to liberal
arts students majoring in an-
othcr department. as well as to
those interested in psychology as
a special field. Courses offered
lby the department are general.

ents in this course has been re—

of Science as well as the Jour—
nals of Social and Applied l’sy-
chology.

The psychology laboratory, lo-
cated in room 123 of AKH. main-
tains an unusually large variety
of equipment for a school the
size of Grinnell. Here one may
find such curious objects as'a
'pneumograph, a device used as
part of a lierdetector for re-
cording breathing, a perimeter,
which charts the color zones of
the eye. and a huge clock which
indicates ‘tinse to one one»hund-
redth of a second.

Professor Mack T. Henderson,
present head of the department,
is assisted by Professor George
in. Lovell. Fartysfive students,
more than pre-war enrollment in
‘proportion to the total student
body, are taking the beginning
jcourse this semester.
