College Plans
Improved Printing

By Thomas w, Duncan
Director of Publicity,
College

In the Grinnell public relations der
partinent this has been a year
of clearingﬁ away underhrush, of
spade work, of preparation for the
tutur-e. A broad policy of public
relations for the college has been
determined and already certain
steps have been taken to put that
policy into operation.

Perhaps the most important der
cision reached during the year
was the one regarding the qualr
ity of printed material going out
from Grinnell College. Oui- bul»
letins in the past, while usually
satisfactory from a typographical
point of view, were seldom out
standing pieces of fine printing,
Early in the year Dr, Samuel N.
Stevens and the public relations
department agreed the best in
printing is none too good for
Crinnell, The next problem was
to find printers who could do the
high quality of work we had in
mind.

We fuund one such printer in
Carroll Coleman, who operates
the Pralrle Press at Muscatine,
Iowa. For a number of years ML
Coleman has worked alone, dc-
signing and publishing books. He
has become nationally known as
a fine printer. Several times dur-
ing the past dozen years his books
have been chosen as among the
fifty best printed hooks to appear
in America during the year. He
has printed a number of books
for such publishers as New D’
reetions, and his own Pr ie
Press imprint has commanded re~
speet from literary critics.

Mr. Coleman has printed sever-

Shirley Ripple, Main senior, was
sworn into the Marines May 11.
She is to report to Camp Le~

jeune, New River, North Catollna,.

in the middle or latter part of
June. She will have six weeks
at boot training at this camp, and
then she will be given four weeks
mess duty in Washington, D. C.
At the present she is assigned to
the procurement district in Des
Moines.

“The. Marines are more demo—
cratic unit because everyone goes
in as a private, and your promcv
tions are based upon your own
work. and also, it is the smallest
women's reserve,” stated Pvt.
Ripple when asked why she chose

al bulletins for us and there are
plans in the air for an even clos—
er connection between him and
Grinnell Collegc in the future.

We have gone to Chicago and
Marshalltown for printing Jobs
too large for Mr. Coleman to un-
dertake. But we have constantly
sought his advice on typographia
cal matters concerning these more
ambitious pieces of work. Several
forthcoming bulletins, as well as
the Gr-inncli College view book7
a beautiful photographic intci-
pretation of life at Gx'lnnclI—wlll.
be ready for distribution within
the next few weeks.

On several occasions during the
year Grinnell has crashed into
newspapers all over the country
with news and feature stories
Among the stories more popular
with the metropolitan press have
been the one concerning the Grin-
nell College laundry and the fear
ture story about John Theobald
and comic strips.

Certain standards for a high
type of public relations have been
set during this year. We feel
that ,we are on the right track
in presenting Grinnell College to
the public at large.
