"Ladies in Reiiremeni"
Exempliiied Technical
And Dramaiic Skill

By Gerry Warren
“Ladies ill Retirement,” a
psychological melodrama, was
presented Saturday night,
Dec. 2, by an allrcollege cast.
With the acting burden 211-
most equally shared by the
seven members of the cast,
the presentation was of lini-
vel‘sally high caliber.
Although it was a difficult
prop play, the back stage end of
the performance went smoothly,
with Louisa's elusive telescope,
Emily’s drift wood, and the
ominous window bars all appear-

ling at the right place at the right

time. The set was beautifully
executed, with emphasis on fine
workmanship. The actors were
letter perfect in their lines, ale
though at times interpretation
was sacrificed to technical pal»
fection.

Marvin As Ellen

Doris Marvin was a cold and
credible mllrderess, She was eSr
pecially good in the scene in
which Ellen tells her nephew Al-
bert that he must leave at once
for Canada. The surprossed fury
and underlying fear were quite
evident. Miss Marvin was not
quite so convincing in portraying
thc remorse felt by Ellen to-
ward thc end of the play
possibly because this remorse
docs not ring true in rhc struc-
_ture of the play. Miss Marvin
was so completely in character
that she did not feel the change.

Annabell Aronson was a mi»
licking Leonora Fiske, and al-
though she appearcd in the first
act only, she almost succeeded
in stealing the show. AS the for-
mer chorus beauty with the hen,
naed wig, she flounccd and sang
and thoroughly enjoyed herself,
giving the type of effortless pare
iormance that can buoy up an
entire play.

Sisters Well Interpreted

Anne Hellcbusch portrayed one
mad sister, Emily, and conquered
her Kentucky accent to do so,
She gave a fine restrained per-
formance of a part that, had she
yielded to the obvious temptation
to burlesque it, would have mftde

‘Dance Brings

Many 'Firsis'

First Formal oi Season
Has Exchange Dances:
Professors +0 Cut in

Remember the old days when
going to a Grinnell Prom
meant that you had to dance
all evening long with the
same man? H0w utterly dev»
astating to a girl's ego. Even
the few stags (men, of course)
who ,ventured to cut-in were

given a dirty look, kick in
the Shins, or both. No
variety, no nothil . What a
rut to be in.

Times have really changed, my
dear senior, since you were a
freshman, as you will see tomor-
row night when the feature of
the evening will be exchange
dances. It’s smart to be popular
and no 'man wants to drag a girl
with only a half-filled dance card.

List of ﬁrsts

Another unique feature about
the 1944 Christmas formal is the
number of firsts it has to its
:redii. _— the first formal of the
season, the first dance this year
to which the quddites will be es-
corted by men instead ‘of toler-
ant roommates, and the first
lance ever held at Crinnell at
which professors will be encour-
aged to cut-in on the co-eds,

Bob Andrews and his band
from Des Moines, wrapped up as
a Christmas package, will swing
out promptly at nine o‘clock and
play until midnight.

Committee heads include Ray
O'Brien and Mary McMurray,
freshman class officers, who are
in charge of decorating the gym;
Bobette Brown and Mary Jean
Finch, dance programs; Mary
Caskey, refreshments; Annabell
Aronson, check room; and Gerry
Warren and Barbara Takahashi,
mural decorations.

Tickets at 5100 per couple are
still available from Barbara
Berkley and may be purchased at
the door for the same price, There
will be no charge for those who
wish to observe from the balco-
ny. All faculty members are cor-
dially invited, even urged, to par-
ticipate in this gala event of the
year. Babysitters can be ob-
tained by calling 715 and asking
for same .

Guests Lodged in Langan

Laugan hall will be open to the
guests from Saturday morning un-
til 2:30 p, in. on Sunday. Upon

arrival the men are to report to

Mr. Schnerr, who will be in the
first floor suite of Langan, If
they do not have tickets, they
may purchase them from him for
50c per bed, and he will assign
rooms. Tickets may be purchased
in advance from the housekeepr
ing department on Thursday and
