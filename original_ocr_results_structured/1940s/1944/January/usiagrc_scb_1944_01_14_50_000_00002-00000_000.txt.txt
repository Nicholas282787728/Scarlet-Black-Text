The Consciem‘ious Dissenler

It is llitll a great deal of apprehension alld .

regret that we have noticed within the paSl
few weclxs. a gro "th of anti»Britlsh feeling
among quite a sizcable .
ican people This l'celi
one area of the count _
class or special interest group so far as can
be seen at this time.
ing inexplicable in its particular and indi-
vidual expression, there are at least four
major motivations froln which it comes,
and these four are wolth any amount of
exploration and explanation in what we be,
lieve to be the sincere best interests of
this nation.

If the anti—British sentiment now cur
rent was either completely justified or com-
pletely in error, the problem of salvaging
the unity so desperately needed for the suc-
ccsfui completion of the war would be a
good deal simpler. We could either strike
out all previously attempted bases for nity
and start over, or we could so definitely
prove the error of present accusations that
the unity of the two nations would stand
forth strengthened by challenge.

But, even if we have the toughest prob-
lem of half-truths to deal with, deal with
it we must. Let us then examine the mo-
tives for anti-British feeling,

First, the lend-lease program. Never,
since the inception of the ion —lease ad
ministration, has the American public as a
whole been able to grasp the program in
anything but a unilateral sense. Ameri-
cans know we are sending a great deal
material to our allies. For some reason,
those allotments made to Great Britain
have ranklcd more than any other. One ex,
planationn may be that the spectacular and
dramatic success of the Russian armies
renders any complaints from us aboht the
donation of material to them too mean for
consideration. The British are handicapped
inasmuch as their part in the nar since
Pearl Harbor,has been, like our own, of a
slower and not always victorious nature.
But they have done their part, a necessary
part, and there is certainly no indication
that they will not continue to carry out

not confined to

creditably any assignments made to them _

by the general council of United Nations
planners and strategists.

Moreover, lend-lease, with Britain or
any other country} is definitely a bi—lateral
program. England itself, as a matter of

fact, is one of the few nations who has re ,

paid more than she alone has received from
us An accurate and \\'idely7circulated re,
port on lend»lease materials coming in to

this nation is drastically needed to ally thei
suspicions and prejudices of a great part of
the public. ,

Secondly, there has been much \leeping
and wailing and general Anglophobia since
the publication of the now famous " :73
ratio of British and American troops fol"
the invasion. In answer to this, several.
things may be said. First, whose figures
are these? No reputable military authority"
has given them out as authenti It would
indeed be criminal negligence for any mill-l
- tary authority even to discuss ill the pub—
lic press or over the radio any such vital!
information as the numbers or even the‘
kind of troops to be used. Secondly, even
ii’ these figures are unchallcngcahly true.‘
there remains much justification for theml
The British are said to be scheduled to con-l
‘ tribute the troops for the first \«avc of,
im sion 7 obviously the more dangerous
taslx. The British also are contributing?
and have contributed during the entire
North African, Sicilian and Italian camv-
paigns, great numbers of effective troops,i
and may very well be left with no morel
fighting men available in the British Isles
than the 27 per cent non promised There
. are, at the same time, known to be largel
numbers of American reserves ill England‘
and Ireland, men prepared for and intended
for the invasion effort. And, lastly, the
populatio of the United States is just about}
three times as large as that of Great
Britain 7 is a 27:73 ratio then so imrl
probable? Yes, we have other men scat-l
tered all over the world 7 but so, (is
. public, have the British .

When we come to a discussion of that
Indian problem, and the greater question;
of British pcst- policy in regard to imll
perialism of all kinds and degrees, the real
. crux of not only any current Anglophobia,
but of all future Anglo-American relations
is reached. Here those presons who pro-l
fess a distrust in or a dislike for Great}
Britain have a point which cannot be light-
ly and politely pushed aside, or even come
batted with very hopeful facts The his-

Nationalist movement is a painful one.
There is nothing to give us hope that the
future may be different than the past ex-;
cept as the future is affected by one force:;
' the people. Not only the British people, but,
the American. and the Russian and that
Chinese and all the United Nations people}
If ever there was a time when ‘world opi 'i
ion' meant a tillker’s damn, it is now I[,l
in the postwar situation, the legitimate and‘
admirable desires of the peoples of the
earth cannot be decisive in the activities of
their agents, then we as human beings
have indeed lost what may be our 1a t
chance to make of this world and time an 71
thing but a whirling squirrel cage.

Do not become an Anglophobe — or any,
other kind of ephobc, on the basis of!
simple misstatements,ol facts which you
can easily verify or refutei Rather become
a critic, not only of England, but of all the
united nations, a critic in the best sense of
'the world. Challege every move that isl

summarily out of keeping with the idealsj
, which have been publicly set forth. Onlyl
Idon’t forget that the United States sub-
scribed to those ideals too, and must not bel
immune from challenge because she is your}
nation. If errors are found in America’sl
record, admit them. And one thing more:‘

i do something about them. i
