With both teams boasting of a
record of four successive Mid-
west conference basketball wins
against no losses, the question,
which of the coefll'st place holders,
Grinnell and Ripon, has the better
basketball team, will be answered
when the Rodmen from Wisconsin
journey to the local campus to
.take on the Pioneers Monday
night. The fray will go down on
records as the first athletic can—
test between the two schools.

For Ripon it will be the first
stop in the hardest two game trip
on this year’s conference schedule.
icoech Lanphear and his men must
face the tough Carleton team at
Northfield, Minnesota, the follow-
ing night after the fight for the
lead at Grinnell. A stop for a

Continued from page 1

Poor floor play by both teams and
Grirmell's failure to get the ball
on rebounds were characteristics
of first half play. The Pioneers
made only 3 points during the
first period, while Drake marched
ahead to hang up 21 points.
Ploy Improves

Both teams were handling the
hall better at the start of the
second half. Hamann and Ken-
dall led the Grinnell five in a ral-
ly that brought them up to with
in a points of the leaders, but the
Bulldogs‘ height and smooth score
ing plays were too much for
them. With about 3 minutes left
in the contest, Drake sent a new
team onto the floor, and the
game ended with both teams try-
ing hard to get the final basket.

The Pioneers will meet Ripon
in their fifth conference game
this Monday night at Grinnell.
Both Ripon and Grinnell are un—
defeated in the Midwest confer-
ence with four wins apiece.

one, the surprise team of the
year, took two wins during the
week of high scoring games to
keep a firm hold on third place,
and is breathing on the necks of
the leaders.

Bcloit beat a state rival, Latw~
renoe, to attain a .500 rating and
,tie Carleton for fourth. The lat-
lter was jumped on by Cornell and
Monmouth on a disastrous road
trip for its only losses.

Lawrence scared Ripon in a
wild game at Appleton but wasted
many a free throw opportunity
and is in the collar.

Gl'lnnell also holds scoring hon-
ors with an aVeragc of 47 points
per game, largely through the ef-
forts of Capt. James Nash who
has been good for twenty points
per appearance. Beloit has been
the hardest to score on as it
has held the opposition to an
average of 32 points a game in
six games
