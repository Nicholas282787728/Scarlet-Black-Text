L. C. Sprague
Will Speak

Railroad President
Will Talk on Rail,
‘ Economic Relatiion

Lluclan c. Sprague, president and

' receiver of the Minneapolis and St.

Louis railroad, will visit Grinnell
on Tuesday, February 27, to talk
with students interested in rail-
road work, and in the general
problem or the relation of iailroad
transportation to the economic
system. Definite announcement of
the time and place of Mr. Spra~
gue’s talk will be made in the
near future. The program was
arranged by President John S.
Nollen and Emory Price, ’10,
chairman of the Minneapolis Al-
umni council.

The Minneapolis and St. Louis
is the only major direct north and
south line of railroad serving this
territory and as such constitutes
an important link in the rail trans-
portation system. It has received
much attention recently as the re-
sult of proposals to reorganize the
line, either as an independent sys-
tem or in conjunction with other
major railroads.

Under the direction of Mr. Spra-
gue the road has consistently
showed a respectable operating re-
turn in contrast to the situation
prevailing with many larger and
better known lines.

Mr. Sprague began as a call
boy for the Chicago, Burlington,
and Quincy Railway Co, in 1339.
He worked for this company as
operator, ﬁreman, and engineer
successfully until 1911. From 1932
to 1935 he was sales manager of
the Chicago Pneumatic Tool com-
pany. Since 1935 he has been
president and coereceiver of the
M, and St. L.

New Deal.
