0 Stevens Writes.

The Grinnell campus to which you return
on this 1941 Homecoming is beginning to
chan‘re physically. Cowles Hall will be an
addi 'on to the men‘s dormitory system It
is located on the extreme north end of
the campus. You will find it to be a build,
ing of splendid proportions and great pro—
mise. The flags which are staked out on the
southern part of Ward Field will show you
where the new men‘s gymnasium is going
to be built, with work starting almost with-
in a week.

There are other changes on the campus,
not entirely physical in character, which
we would like you to become aware of. The
men’s dormitories have been greatly im-
proved and modernized. Many thousands
of dollars have been spent in bringing them
up to date. This is one of the achievements
of our summer reconditioning program.

Our new housekeeping system is produc-
ing a brighter and cleaner campus. You
will observe men and women quietly uni-
formed, going about the tasks of keeping
the campus buildings clean and beautiful
for students and friends.

If you are inclined to listen to the over-
tones in the conversation of students and

faculty, you will likely hear a new voice"
of hope and aspiration. You will feel the
Vital impulse of a common striving for
excellence in all things which is gradually
becoming the dominant motivation of all
01' us who live here.

if you examine the pattem of courses
you will notice changes in the curriculum
just as you will notice new faces among the
faculty.

With all of these changes, however, no
one coming back to alma mater will feel
strange or ill at ease, for the fundamental
spirit of the College remains the same, and
the fellowship of men and women who are
a part of Grinnell is still warm and friend-
ly.
We hope that your stay will be pleasant
and exciting. We sincerely believe that the
College is deserving of your full loyalty,
and we hope as the years go by to con,-
tinue to enjoy your active support and your
intelligent good will. Feel free to call upon
any of us, administration, faculty, or stu-
dents, for such services as may make your
visit here at Homecoming the most pleasant
that you have ever experienced.

0 Grinnell in National Defense.

Coincident with the rise of the New Deal,
has been the rise of Grinnell in national
politics. When the New Deal was at its
peak, Gl'innell had more representatives
in Roosevelt’s reform program than any
other school in the country with the 6x7
ception of Halyard.

There was Harry Hopkins, former head
of the Works Progress Administration.
Hopkins has also served as Secretary of
Commerce, Chester Davis, now president
of the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis,
was former administrator of the AAA,
and a member of the Federal Reserve Board
of Governors Paul Appleby has recently
risen to the front as Undersecretary of
Agriculture. .

Now Grinnell is rising in a new fronti
that of National Defense. Hopkins, now
closest friend to President Roosevelt, acts
as his personal advisor in affairs both
domestic and foreign.

Appleby, too, in the field of agriculture,
is doing much to further production by the
American farmer.

Other Grinnellians vital to defense are
Oliver Buckley, president of the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories, and Ernest Benger, re—
search chemist for Dupont. More than half
the work these companies are doing now is
for the government.

Football is in the air, and it is
time that someone brought to
light the unofficial reaction of
members of the Missouri Valley
conference when, four years ago,
it was learned that Grinnell would
withdraw from that body of
schools. .

Surpl‘lsmgly enough, there was
real sorrow among conference del-
egates when the Grinnell petition
for withdrawal was read, One
representative from another school
stood up in the meeting and beg
ged Gnnnell to reconsider.

And why was Grimell so bad
ly needed in the conference?

Grinnell's scholastic reputation
permitted some of the other con-
‘ference members to schedule
games with colleges having very
high standards—who carded. the
matches because the Missouri
Valley school belonged to the con-
ference, and Grinnell was a mem-
her, too.

prep cups on the east side of the campus. Never before have we
witnessed such a parade of red sweaters, skirts, and dresses. If
you'd like to see a couple of smooth red outfits, take a look at
Dulcy Goldstein’s corduroy suit and Bobbie Baker's long torso
dress. Incidentally, girls, if you haven't a red outfit yet, the Broad-

Way has a nice selection.
