Look, It’s Springl. ' l

From the battlefields of Europe and the
bloody southern seas, gloom is drifting in
toward America. Our critics accuse us of
flippancy. Our critics walk in woe, with
cynical faces and bitter words.

We, in war-torn world, are not unaware
of its stark tragedy. But we are also hug
man beings, and spring at Gl'innell is still
a lovely thing.

Our eyes are not shut to starvation and
death, but neither will they be shut to
lilacs and sunlight. And in spring also there
alrighe three Baa beer, blankets, and still
— ys.

. Library Progress.

Once upon a time there was a fine old
building, just sitting and waiting, the way
old buildings do, for nobody ever knows
what. This grandrdaddy among the younger,
sturdier buildings was very patient about
holding the piles of paper that the ant-
people put in him, very patient about letting
the anbpeople crawl up and down his stairs
with heavy shoe, very patient when the
ant—people neglected to camouflage his age
with ivyl

But there was one thing he could not
stand. . . If the ant-people vibrated his two»
by—fours with their chatter, that could be
endured; if they gave him more books to
keep than he thought he should, that was all
right, because he didn’t mind crowding a
little. But there was just one thing at
which he silently l‘evolted: He had leaks in
his roof, and the antvpeople weren’t doing
anything about it.

They built other buildingsia gymnasium,
a radio studio, and a dormitory—but they
let the plaster fall and the ink smear. The
grand-daddy building had leaks in his roof,
and they weren’t doing anything about it.

 

Reviewer Finds Praise For First Concert
By Crinnell Symphony Orchestra Sunday T 0 Le C ’ru re

‘ By Mdriorie Hospers

With Glen Swan directing and
Sarah Lune: MacDonald as featur-
ed soloist, the Grinnell Symphony
Orchestra. presented its first Con-
cert of the second semester last
Sunday afternoon in Herrick
Chapel.

Opening with the national nn-
them, the program showed fine
musical interpretation on the iwo
main compositions of the program,
Cesar Frnnok's Symphony in D
minor, and Beethoven’s Concerto
in c Minor, Opus 37 for piano and
orchestra.

The symphony moved with fine
dramatic climaxes and was con-
vincingly played. What could easily
have become ll lugubzious and
monotonous composition was vital
and significant, conducted with
sincere musical feeling.

The Largo movement of the
Concerto was especially beautiful,
and it gave Miss MacDonald a real
chance for expression. The ionsl
beauty of me movement iisclf, the
welHiandled accompaniment and
the skillful technique of the solo-
ist made this movement the high
spot of the concerto, iliough the
entire composition was played
with comprehension and thought.
Vlvccily and brillisncy marked the
last movement, the most ismilinr,
and was, wiih Lhe Largo move-
ment, responsible for ihe enthusi-
astlc applause of the audience.

With the augmented personnel
of the orohmzrs, the sensitive
direction of Mr. Swan, and me
excellent performance of Miss
Mscncnsld. the concert as a. whole
impressed listeners as the be-
ginning or a. Central Iowa Sym»
phony.

Hale Plan of Knox Denounced

Michigan Editor
Objects to Navy's
Psychological Training

Criticism of the Navy's recently
announced plan to employ phy-
Cholog'ists who will “engender in
aviation csdcis a hate for our
enemies and their methods” was
made in a letter today to Secre-
tary of ihe Navy Frank Knox
by Homer D. Swander, .Yr., presi-
dent of the Student League of
America.

Swander, a junior at the Uni-
versity of Michigan and an edir
tor on the college daily, pointed
out in his letter that "the Stu-
dent League, whose members were
interventionists long before Pearl
Harbor and are now solidly be-
hind anything which will help in
the war effort, vigorously objects
to such a program of "psycholog-
icsl- training.

FOUND: Phi Beta Kappa Key.

Owner may have some by
getting in touch with S. 51 B.
and pcying for this cd.

“Those of us who are going to
fight this war, do not and do not
wan: to, hate the German, Italian
or :upaneses people, We hone
their ideas and what they stand
for, certainly. But we also realize
that after the war is over we are
going on have io live in s world
community with the very persons
we are now fighting; and we
know that engcndermg hate to;
day Will only pave the way for
a breakup of Unit community
and eventually another war.

“Furthermore, this is not a
battle which must be fought with
a concept as negative as hate. We
will have a far greater chance for
victory if our soldiers nd sailors
are taught that the United Na-
tions are fighting for the posi-
tive concept of freedom. When a
man comes to understand the real,
basic issues of liberty versus slav-
ery, of prosperity versus poverty,
he will fight with a vigor and a
courage unmatched by any hate-
filled man on eurih.

“We appeal to you, then, m the
interests of victory and the per-
manent peace to immediately stop
any program of the Navy's which
is dcsigncd to instill hatred in the
men of our armed force."

. . JOBS

The Civil Service commission faces a tremendous task Recent possum!
of the Rsmspeck amendment brings 85 per 'cent of federal Jobs~an
all- time high‘under commission scutiny. Workers in non- war agencies
must be funneled into at-wsr agencies, Countless new workers must
he found and doveisllcd into the government army.

This means thousands of potential jobs for college people,
whose specialized training is eagerly sought. Often the
government is stepping in, through civil service, to give
college people on-the-job trainingi“maj0rs” in lines where
they are needed most.

An example is the recent move to enlist college women for “men's
work.” As laboratory aides in army arsenals, they inspect
gauges used in testing ordnance materials, Caveds who wish such
jobs should have at least two years of college work, including some
physics, chemistry and trigonometry. The goal or civil service is 100
girls a. month for the next 10 months. Initial pay, $1620 annually,
Although about 87 per cent of government jobs are “in the
field,’ as Washingtonians blithely dismiss the United States,
some are located here m the capital. Don't take too seriously
what you 7£H£l and hem of crowded and costly living candl-
li’ims me. A salmy of $2 000 here 13 equal, roughly, to one of
$1, 800 iii a city of compwablo size Living qizmtms are
moulded to be am 0, but turikoum of tenants is high. Which.
means you’ll always final in place if you watch closely and
jump quickly.

If you were one of the some 16,000 college people who filed
with civil selyice last month for a ”Junior professional as—
sistant" Job, it may interest you to know the exams won’t
be given until this spring. April’s the best guess.

It's open season “indefinitely" on seniors and graduates in hemistry,
physics and engineerin So hot is the pursuit that civil service
has abandoned oompet examinations in these fields—pmlmbly for
the duration. simply show on your application blanks that you
have had requislm training. In the imse of successml candidates
who are seniors, “provisional appomtmenis" will be made, which
mm jobs, come spring and graduation.
You’ll be classed as a “junior professional assistant" wifh ,- .

52,000 a year, although many agencies will try to get yol [or les
unless you say on your blank that you won't take less,

Others of Uncle Samuel’s favorite nephews and nieces are
economists. Currently favored are those with at least two
years of graduate work or cperience. Successful application
éllrougll civil service may bring a job paying from $2,600 to
5,600.
