The Drake game seems to he ii kind of hungieeuoogie tor uni-i
Barker, veteran Pioneer back. In his three years of varsity compet
tion. 193643940, he has missed the Drake game twice because at
that old knee injuly The ﬁrst time was back in 1935. The second
time came last week, when Barker had to read about the game at
the hospital.

Ami u-lne re talking iihout the Drake game: it ems that there's
a rumor around to the effect that Pres. Stevens isn't in favor ot any
more contests With the Bulldogs. He substantiated that rumor the
other day and gave a few of his own personal reasons As he put it,
the Grinnell-Drake gaine should be discontinued because: 1. We are
outclassed; 2. The danger of injuries is increased; 3. Drake has such
a large squad that they are capable of putting at least two teams of
equal strength on the field, making it necessaly for Gl'lnnell to play a
small number of players to keep things under control. This, according
to Pres. Stevens. results in a large loss of emotional physical assets
by the Gl'innell players, and, 4. Drake's athletic policy is not in line
with ours.

There are some rery sound reasons here. hut let's not mane this ii
critical situation just now. As I understand it, We‘re tentatively sched-
uled to play Drake in ism. Maybe things Will be different hy then . .

Mount Vernon, Judging from the success ot Gl'innell's 193!) observ-
ance, there should be a lot of celebrating on the Purple campus tlns
