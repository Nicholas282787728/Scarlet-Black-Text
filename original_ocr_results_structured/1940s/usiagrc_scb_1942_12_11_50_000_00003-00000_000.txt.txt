OPEN FORUM

To the Editor:

with the advent of snow and
ice, it would surely be a good
idea to prevent harmful tails
when possible. There is one place
frequented by almost every stur
dent in college that is a hazzal‘d
of therirst water. I speak of the
bookstore steps.

Ever since the first snow, the
stairs have been icy. After each
succeedmg snow, the lee packs
harder and rougher. At best the
stairs arc tricky. in past years
the stairs have been chipped rrcc
from ice after a storm and B137
FORE someone incurred a broken
spine. How about tho same main.
