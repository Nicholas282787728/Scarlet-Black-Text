 

Dr, Canute Hansen, Director of Physical Edu»
cation at the College of the City cl New York,
has designed these weird looking masks which
will entirely prevent lace or head injuries. The
masks are now in actual use at the college and
in all intercollegiate bouts the wearing of the
masks is a strict requirement. Because at their
demonstrated effectiveness, universities and
others that heretofore banned boxing are be-
coming interested in resuming it. Dr. Hansen‘s
idea opens up a new era in collegiate pugilism.
