GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

The idea 0i' limiting electrical output in
the dormitories and quadi" ngle is not a new
one, The college has suffered financially
for i'cars because of students’ extravagance
in ills illilig and utili"ng electrical applio
auces. Last year sd\ all increase of ten
percent over the previous year’s ekpeildir
till-es for electricity on the i npus, pushing"
the bill to the almost unbelievable total of
$30,000. This in itself would justify ad-
ministrative action. but a more important
factor enters in. The eve increasing load
upon the electllcal wiring system in Grin»
llcll has almost reached its pcalf capac' .
Last year \l'ires leading into the campus
sy telii were found to be smoking; more and
more pouer lines have had to be replaced.
The administration this year had to chose
between two alternatives: (1) letting inat—
ters ride and looting a very lnal 'ed in-
crease in expenditures for electl- it due
to an extensive replacement of leadvin pou‘cl
lines; (2) limiting student usage of clear
tl-icity. The latter plan was adopted.

The reasoning and ruling 01' the college
administration as we understand it is sound.
We do take issue with the execution of
these regulations when student’s rooms are
i vaded, private property destroyed, and
i urcs taken down at student expense \lith
no previous warning. We trust that these
unwarranted actions will not be repeated

to be back of their team, win, or
lose or draw? Is their enthusiasm
going to go beyond raising a few
cmps of whiskers in honor of the
occasion?

The couches czhn't do it alone.
The team can't do it clone. The
Quarterbacks can’t do it alone.
The student body can't do it alone,
but if on of these factors will
work together innl help each
other, it can be done.

A. winning team is not every-
thing to a. college education, but
it counts. Your school is judged
by its record, both athletically and
scholastioclly and in (lays not too
long ago, a. Grinnell graduate cn-
joyed c unique position in the
world. He or she was looked up—
on with envy as having attended
Grinnell. This happy state of at-
fairs was brought about by the
famous "Old Grillneli Spirit,"

The Quarterbacks, ‘mimy cl
whom have played on Griliiiell
teams, fool thut Griiuicll is not up
to the high standard set in for-
me: years. Bccuuse of their love
for Grinnoll and whct it stands
for, they are willing to assist in
every holiest method to bring
Grinnell hack to its former prom-
inent place in the slate and un-

You who are fortunate enough
to be students now can do this.
You will in after years realize
that Grinnell is made] up, not only
of present day students, but at»
dent lovers of the old school, who
still are vitally interested in plac-
ing Grinnell again in the lead.

This can be done by enthulastic
support of all people. The desire
to win can be implanted in coch

and boost fhc college, for in the
years to come, your iisscciatlon

Elise Lieberman
Models Diamonds
For National Ad

Elise Lieberman, Pine Tree fresh-
man woman, had several pictures
taken this summer. These same
picture: are now to he found in
several national magazines, in the
i-otogi-avurc section of the Des
Moines Sundcy Register, and in
the display wmdow of a local
jewelry store.

The pictures were the basis of
an advertising campaign staged
by a Chicago diamond concern of
which Miss Lieberman's fatheris
a partner,

The advertising manager of the
diamond syndicate suggested us-
ing the Pine Tree coed instead of
a professional model when the
current campaign was being
planned.

According to Miss Lieberman,
her father was not enthusiastic
about the idea, but she finally
won his approval.

“Yes, I would like to be a pro
fessional model, but I am not
thinking of it as.a cancer," she
said.

granted for continuation of both
primary and secondary training.
“Right now there is a. certain
group, lcd by the editor of an
aviation magazine, that is bring-
ing pressure to bear upon the
minor faults of the progrcm.
Their condemnation of the pro~
gram is based upon their belief
that the CPT does not turn out
pilots of army caliber, They seem
to forget," he added, "that the
CPT can turn out a secondary
pilot for $1400, while it takes
the army $10,000 to do the same
thing.”

“It's up to our congressmen,"
Neidtrhauser concluded, “If we
can let them know exactly what
good the CiVllian Pilot Training
program is doing, and how those
minor faults can be ironed out,
we, as well as other colleges in
the country, will have further
pilot training.”
