unscrupulous, so quick to seize

now threatening,’ but these words
have often been used to describe
Hitler at the present time.

“Many of the famous war
speeches of history have been re-
pedted today. Even Cicero's opcne
mg address in the Forum at
Rome according Mithrndates could
be taken as one of Churchill's

‘speeches concerning the NaZis.

”‘(Theyl devoted all the period
which followed the first war, not
to cffucmg the memory of the
last conflict, but in preparing for
a new one,’

“And so it is that we can trace
almost every modern speech back
to some famous orator in history,"
Phillips continued “Even the
speeches of World War I have
been regiven today.

“Kai er Whilllelm's speech at
the beginning of the first World
War scems to have been taken as
an example by Hitler.

“‘In the midst of peace the
world attacks us Thcrefore up!
To arms! It is the question of the
existence or nonexistence of Ger-
man might and German culture
The only difference htwocn this
speech and Hitler's is the timc
limit. Williclm spoke in five min-
utcs, while Hitler took almost
five hours to achieve his aim.

“Even the speeches made totlzw
dealing with getting money to
finance the war have their coun-
tci-parts in history," Phillips
said. Patrick Henry mid Samuel

_Clny plcudcd fri- money with the

same phrases we henr tozlay.Tilat
was in 131:, some 130 years ago

“Franklin Lane, Secretary of
interior in World War I, said,
We need your money I Lisk you
as volunteers in the sci-vice of
your country, to help in the sue
ccssful prosecution of this war. J
know of no people more capable
of contributing in small amounts
and large to replenishing our
treasury. Give to the president, so
that he may fashion it into a

great spear, and with it over-
throw the champion of the prin-
ciple which enable the few to en-
slave the many.’

”Compare this speech with the
speeches made by President
Roosevelt or Morgenthau.

“So the history of oratory has
repeated itself, War by war, age
by age, and man by man."

In conclusion, Phillips read the
last portion of a speech given by
Winston Churchill last spring.

”‘1 have nothing to offer but
blood, toil, sweat and tears. We
have before us an ordeal of the
most grievous kind. We have be-
fore us many months of struggle
and suffering,’

“It is almost word for word
the Third Olynthia of names
thenes, given over 2,000 years be-
fore!"
