MichiganCollege
, Psychia’rrisls Use
Musical Therapy

East Lansing, MichngCPlg
Michigan Statc collegc now of—
fers a course in music therapy.

"‘Music therapy is the treats
incnt of physical and mental ills
by the use of music. Here is a
sample of how it works;

“A woman is brought into the
hospital suffering from a mental
maladjustment, since 60%
of all mental patients are
suffering from environmental dis-
orders, we will attribute her be-
havior to this cause. Withdraw-
ing from all reality, she is now
living in a world of the unconr
scious. She cannot perform even
the simplest voluntary action.

“It is an exceedingly difficult
task for a psychiatrist to aid her
while she remains in this state.
At this stage the music therapist
brings various types of music
from his file. A study of the pa-
tient's background has revealed
that shc is a descendant of for-
eign born parents. Folk songs are
played repeatedly. Suddenly one
of them causes her to weep bit-
terly. It was a song that her

mother sang to her as a child.

threat an the basketball court,
Two veteran guards, Bruce
Larson and Don Boya, round but
the probable Lawrence starting
lineup Larson was voted the
team‘s most valuable player last
year as he notched 173 points in
20 games. This year he has hit
on 39% of his shots. Boya at 5 ft.,

the team, but he makes up in
speed and fight what he lacks in
size. .
Lawrence has averaged 65.3
