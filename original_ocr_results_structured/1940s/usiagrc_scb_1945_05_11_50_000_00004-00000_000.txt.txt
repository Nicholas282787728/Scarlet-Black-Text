Sideline Speculations and

Intramural

By Jean Kiefer

This week's softball games give
us a little hetter idea of how the
various cottage teams are sharp-
ing up, So far, Haines is on top,
having won hcth games it has
played so far—beating James
11-10 and Main 21-5.

That leaves us with a four-way
tie for second. James has won
one game, against Mears, by a
score of 13-10. Read has come
out on top in one of its two
games, 32-6 over Main. while
Mears' one victory was over
Read, hy the knock-out score of
14-2. Cleveland's one claim to
fame lies in its victory over Main.

So six of the fifteen games
that make up the softball round-
rohin have been played off, and
last week’s predictions look a
little sick. We haven’t seen
enough of Cleveland to know
much about that outfit, out Road

this year. After four-star teams.
pep. and sportsmanship in every
other intramural all year, they
seem to have lost the smoothness
and whole-hearted cooperation
that has keynoted their playing.

Instead, Haines looks like it
might lay claim to tlrst title',
with a bunch of steady players
that want to make their last
chance good. Strong competition
comes from that slug-happy Mears
team that is on the crest of the
wave this week. If they don't

On a day that was ideal for

record breaking, East high

Jesse Palmer, lanky lad from
