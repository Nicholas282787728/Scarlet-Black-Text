Pioneers “Meet Tough Bruins
In~ Tomorrow’s Football Tussle

Tomorrow afternoon on Ward1
field the Pioneers will tackle a
team which may easily prove its
self to be their toughest oppon-
ent of the seasonithe Washing-
ton university Bruins. Washing-
ton, whose school enrollment tops
13,000, 9,700 of which are men
students, has toppled e foes with-
out defeat and has amassed 133‘
points to only 40 [or their op-
ponents.

But in spite of Washington
spotless record this year, Coach
cakes is not pessimistic about
toino uw’s game. Said he, “I
think we have a chance to heat
Washington. I believe we will be!
capable physically and mentally.‘
We have a few bumps and
bruises which should clear up by
this Saturday. We must also look
ahead to beating Ripon in our
last game; a team which is unde-
feated so far in conference play.
They beat Lawrence 1976.”

Undeniably, tho , the Wash:
ington Bruins ar packed with
power and ability, and will be
striving for their seventh consece
iitive triumph of the season.

They can attributealarge por
tion of their success to their 200
pound, E»ft. 2-in. fullback, Hank
Christman. Hank utilized his
power last year to the extent
that he was one of the nation’s
top scorers. .

Not as power-ml asVChrlslman,
but none-the—less a dangerous‘
ball-carrier and potential gaine-
breaker, is Chuck Winner, a 57ft.
G-ln., 159 pounder who operates
at right half. Speedy Bill Sivick,
a fearless runner and good de-
fense man, at left half, and Lu
naii-lings, the Bruins sharp-
shoeting quarterback, round out
the backfield. ‘

Six foot two, 191 pound Bob
Bennett and Rudy Stinnett.i

 

standing 6 feet and weighing 184
pounds, are Rawlings' capable‘
targets at the ends. l

Two rocking tackles, each
standing 67ft. 3-in. and weighing
over 200 pounds, are Norm Hali-

ddy and Merril Reynolds. Team-
ing up ivith Danna at guard is
152 pound John Gillespie, while
Hank Prokop, 210, is the center,
completing n line which averages
194 pounds.

Washington's strong and heavy
reserve unit has also been mSCI'ue

“The loyalty and spirit shown by
"Ludenl’. hody, faculty, and friends
in .following our team to Mt.
Vernon for the Cornell game was
as fine as I have ever seen. Even
when w: were having difficulties
the first if, we definitely felt
their encou assement right behind
us, We the hard to win for
You."
