Vote on November 2. We know that
solemn exhortations are seldom read.

But, we can remind campus voters
that to let an unmarked ballot lie in a
desk drawer is a gesture empty as a
politician’s “golden promise" speech.
Most states require the return of ab-
sentee ballots well before November
2. Iowans are' lucky; they can let it
ride until November 1.

We‘re allowing town students and mar-
ried couples who can vote on the spot little
excuse for neglecting the election. Voting
information is easily obtainable; in fact,
we have it right here.

It is often said that a one party system
would pattern us after a totalitarian Ger-
many; that a multi-party system would
brim;r to us the anarchy of modern France;
and that a two party system, as has char-
acterized our history, avoids these two
evils and leaves a\ residue scarcely to be
envisoned by even a Thomas More. Why
then, if this be Utopia, a Third Party?

Democracy, if it be defined properv
1y, requires an opportunity for the vot-
er to express himself politically. lf ex-
pression cannot be found within the
two party framework, recourse can only
be had outside these hallowed halls.

This train of events is the situation

facing many of us today.

The Democratic and Republican parties,‘

since Dec. '7, 1941, have clutched proudly to

of the two party system in America.

One hundred and seven prominent
Americans, united in what they term-
ed a defense of freedom of inquii ,
have presented a request for the lift,
ing of the ban on THE NATION by the
public schools of New York city and a
program for the establishment of a na-
tional educational policy to prevent the
suppression of ideas, the exercise of in-
timidation by public officials, and the
development of a generation growing
up in ignorance of the controversial
ideas it will have to face.

This November a significant number of
those voters that take the trouble to cast

their ballots will vote for some presidential

candidate other than Mr. Dewey or M

r.

‘ as of one mind.

The views were set forth in a document
entitled “An Appeal to Reason and Gone
science," made public in behalf of the sig-
natories by Archibald MacLeisch, former
Assistant Secretary of State and United
States representative in UNESCO, who is
the chairman of an Ad Hoc committee to
Lift the Ban on THE NATION. The signa-
tories to the document include outstanding
educators, religious leaders of all faiths,
political personalities, writers, publishers,
playwrights, and radio commentators.

The New York city Board of Super-
intendents banned THE NATION be»

foreign policy. It seems preposterous that

E. R. P. a necessary economic aid misused
as an ideological weapon, and our refusal

similar interests here at home. Many of us
voters cannot find political expression in
either camp,

Thurmond may be dismissed as a section-
al phenomenon.

The half»million plus votes that will
be cast for Mr. Thomas and the two to
five million votes expected for CMix Wal-
lace are quite another matter. In
many cases these votes can be count-
ed not as an endorsement of Socialist
or Progressive platforms but as a pro-
test against the hi~partisan grouping
and groping of the two conventional
parties.

This is particularly applicable in the case

of the Catholic Church in such matters
as education, science, medicine, mar-
