Something To Do Aboui It — -

You’re sick of hearing about it, aren’t
you? The newspapers, magazines, the radio,
throw it at you every time they can. It’s
been drummed into you and me, and will
be, thank God, until enough is done about it.

We are talking about European and
Asiatic starvation, of course. Finally, and
rather vaguely, we are beginning to realize
what it is like over there. Time magazine,
last week, carried an article on starvation

that should keep a wellefed American awake

newspaper, look at the llewsreels, Or if you
want things first hand, get Rolf to tell you
about the diet that “well-fed” Norway had‘
during and after the War, and draw yourl
conclusions as to the even worse state of
the rest of the world from that.

OK, it’s bad, Very bad, We're agreed
on that. The U.S. is sending food, so things,
should be better soon. But the U.S. is not:
sending enough food because the farmers
are slow in relinquishing their reserves even
on a 30c a bushel bonus, and the US justi
has to eat too darn much of what is avail—
able.

There are some college students who
are really worried about this business. . .
students like we are, just as fond of good
food and plenty of it. Representatives of
seventy-five colleges, meeting in New York
last week, voted to urge their school author-
ities t serve less bread and less ice cream.
’Spec ally, they urged that college dietie
cialls cut out consumption of wheat by 30 /J»
by observing wheatless Tuesdays, and save
10% on fats and oils by boiling and broiling
food instead of frying it. These students
went so far as to vote a hunger strike if
the administration did not make these[
changes immediately.

Here is something concrete and effecv
tive for us to do. We don't mean strike, for
it certainly won’t be necessary, but we can
urge the dieticians to out our consumption
of fats and oils and wheat products, that
more of these vital foods will flow into the
life-saving ships bound for the starving of
the world. We are sure that if we sincerely
ask for a substitution of foods that are not‘
needed for shipment, we will get it.
