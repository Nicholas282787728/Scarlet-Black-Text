With the number of nervous
breakdowns among the stua
dent body increasingr title to
anxiety over WHAT happens
on May 15, Student Council
president Marilyn McCool last
night stated that she had de—
cided to tell all.

On that date. she said, the
forces of Friars and Student
Council will be combined to pre-
sent the greatest expose of the
century: the 1943 Faculty Foolics.

The policy of err-presentation
of the show was decided last week
by members of both organizations,
following lengthy discussion, she
said.

All proceeds o the show will
go directly to the War Chest
fund, expenses of productin being
defrayed by the student council.

The show will reverse the pro-
cess of the “Faculty Follies” of
the past years, in which profes-
sors have interpreted the doings
of the student body.

Feeling it is high time that
democracy in action be inter»
jected into the Grinneil scene.
Miss McCool said, the show will
present to the faculty the stu-
dents' ideas on how things are
run here and why change is 1111*

Final Decision on
Summer School

Session ls "NO"

Dr. Henry s, Con" a, chairman
of the Grinnell College faculty,
revealed last night that there
Willi he no summer school here
this year.

Plans for such a project were
raised in a faculty meeting, and
reported to the students in the
Scarlet and Black issue of March
26th. At this meeting the fac-
ulty handed the problem to Dr.
Stevens and suggested that he
use his own judgment. Since
that time, however, Dr. Stevens
has decided that a summer school
at Grinnell is not necessarily vale
uable to the welfare of the col-
lege or students, Conard said.

Council Ac’rion
Prinled in Full

Voled to Refund 50 cenis

to Every Man in College;
War Chesl Grant Passed

Because part of a story concern-
ing measures of the Council of
House Presidents was omitted
two wcclts ago, the S and B
wishes to print the deleted items.

, , the Council voted to roe
fund every man in college fifty
cents. This deduction has been
taken from incn's room deposits
for many years for “Men's Cor-
ernment." The original deduce
non was auniorized by the Men’s
Senate—predecessor of the c of
H. P, Now that a portion of the
men's social fee goes to the
Council, the other deduction was
deemed unnecessary. ‘A. letter-
has been scnt to Mr. Louis V.
Phelps. treasurcr of the college
by the Council authorizing him
to strike the deduction from
men's room deposits. The Coun-
cil also stated that the item
was not to be deducted again
until extraspecisl causes were
presentcd by the Council and
discussed with the treasurer.

”Slewzrt McElravy, Dibble
junior, was elected c. of H. P.
men's reprcsentativc in accord-
ance with the duration plan for
student government. One of his
main duties is to handle the elec-
tion of house president(sl next
year in accordance With C. of H.
r. rules.

“A balance of
funds, after financial provisions
have been made for the next
body, will be turned over to the
Grinnell War Ghost, in addition
to the twenty-five dollars already
voted by the council,"

Sludenl‘ Council Advises Opposi’rion
To File IO Pcl‘ Pe+i+ion ll: Inferesl'ed

Declaring the action 01 the present members of the C. of H. P.
in postponing elections of that body until the beginning of
next semester to be legal under the terms of that organiza-
tion’S constitution, the student council last night handed down
the final tlecl'sinil in the “graft and corruption” scandal threat

0n the past week.

In the hottest council meeting since Rocky Hampton
threw the Spanish Inquisition of last year back into the fan
onlty‘s lap, president Marilyn McCool presided \\hile C. at H,
R representatives, signers of the open forum letter printed
in last week’s Scarlet and Black, and members of hoi poloi
Spent a merry evening in the mazes of constitutionality, peix

sonali

With the issue at least hazily
defined in the minds of all present
at the open meeting, Miss McCool
called on W Iiain McKeon, one of
the signers and former president
of the student council, to present
the case of that group of stu-
dents.

In the open forum letter, two
points had been intioduced as
questionable The first of these,
till- legality at a ‘ grant to the
brim-s by the C of H. 9., was
withdrawn by McKEon at the mil-
sL't (if [he meeting. The use of
this money, for plaques, Cyclone
pictures, and the war chest dona-
tion, had been satisfactorily exV
plamcd by Howard Lurie, presi-
dent of both C. of H. P. and
Friars, McKcon admitted.

On the second point, the legality
of postponement of house elec-
tions, the remainder of the man
hour discussion was spent.

Ed Krause, Clark-Read junior,
then took over the argument for
the prosecution. stressing that
his attack was strictly ”on methe
od, not substance," Krause de—
clared that postponement of elecn
tions for such a long period neces-
sitated an amendment to the C.
of H. P. constitution. Verbaliza-
tion on this point, varying de-
cidedly in purpose as the evening
progressed, went on for two
hours.

High point of the constlnc-

tive WOlk of the meeting was
the establishment of the sta—

tus of a by-law. After discus-

Reign of Formalism +0 End

Although W'hirlaway will not
make his annual appearance at
Grinnell’s Derby races this year,
the Brown Derby dance will bring
to an end the monotony of for-
mal dances on this campus, Bars
barzt Brann, president of Theta
Sigma Phi, stated last night.

Students may come garbed in
suits, sweaters or barrels, but any
man who presents himself at the
gate attired in white tie and tails
will be given the gate before he
can say Lucius Beebe.

Miss Brann announced that the
Gsdabouts are cooperating with
Theta Sigma Phi in sponsoring

the affair, and added that the
May 1 Derby will ring down the
curtain on the Gadabout’s activi-
ties for the year.

The Black and Blue, yearly pub-
lication winch makes a furtive
appearance during each Derby
dance, will again be in evidence,
Miss Brann prophesied.

Gadabout members will be ad.
mitted free of charge to the
journalists jainborce, but a toll
of 75 cents Will be extracted from
nonrmember stage, and $100 will
be assessed each couple who do
not possess Gatlabout ducats.

clal gloups, and students plie-
sent failed to decide this is

the social science faculty were
contacted by telephone to prtr
viole advice.

Frederick L. Baumann, associ-
ate professor of history, and
Stuart Gerry Brown, associate
professor of English, with refer-
t-nct-s to Roberts‘ rarliamentary
Procedure, established that a by-
law is a part of the body of the
constitution, and as such super-
cedcs mi amendment, uhicli is an
appendage.

A 16-page report of the
meeting, compiled by Janet
Pearce, secrctary of the coun-
cil, has been submitted to the
Scarlet and Black for source
material for this article, and
Lhe outlinc of the meeting
therein presented has been
used to give a chronological
account of the discussion.

KRAUSE: Article seven of the
c. of H. P. constitution, giving
that body power to "revoke or re»
vive old laws" does not grant
members of that group to abrc»
gate article one. section
seven, point e, which states that
the “dates of installation set by
the c. of H. P. shall be wtihin
the first two weeks of April.”

LUltlE: Obviously the dates of
election shall be set by the C. of
H. P. The purpose of a govern»
ment is not to create positions
except those which are needed to
fulfill the duties of the organiza-
tion, The purpose of this action
of the c, of H. P. is to provide
the best deal for the best men.
Our action of postponement was
taken in accordance with the
view that only those men who
will be here next year should
choose the leaders of next year.
