Builders 01‘ Tommorrow - -

0n the many hattleironts of the world, in the prison camps, or
in internment camps, are students. Some are fighting men strug—
gling to win this war that we may have freedom. Others are
retugees studying to equip themselves tor the future. We may
know them, either as follow Crinnellians, or as the hoy or girl
down the block, whether we know them or not, whether Chinese
or Russians, English or French makes little dirterenoe. They are
students7the builders of tomorrow.

To help them prepare for the future, the World Student Service

iind was established. This organization is the recognized medium

helping students throughout the world. It is the recognized
channel for aid to student prisoners of war. The W. S. S. F.
subsidizes forevgn students in rebuilding schools, it has granted
many scholarships to retngecs from Germany, Poland, France, and
the Amel‘icall»]apanese ot the west coast.

Crinnellians all hold fast to their way of lire—their ability
to express themselves7their absolute freedom of speech. All of
us hold dearly the democratic way of life which prevails over our
campus7somctimes we call it the Crinnell Spirit, But it is more
than that, It is what we are fighting for today. Label it what
you please.

Is it not our duty, we who enjoy this spirit so much, to help
others know of its richness, to partially help those interned within
barbed wire to have Comfort? Is it too much for us to pay for
a Chinese student’s notebooks, or texts?

Ciro that others may learnt

Sincerely Yours - -

Dear Dr. Lavell:

You left us without a word, as is your inimitable quiet way.
It would have been difficult to find words to tell you personally
how much we wish you could have stayed, how we hated to see

_ you go. Such words probably look trite on paper But we want
you to know the devotion and admiration you inspired in all
those who knew you, even slightly.

Maybe your tangible accomplishments, the books you wrote,
won't long be remembered. But, as is so often the case at Grinnell,
it’s the spirit that counts. You were a part or that Crinnell Spirit,
Dr. Lavell7a most elegant example of the best it can produce.

We knew and loved you for that spirit and the way in which
it was expressed, Trusting in us, fellow Grinnellians, you prac—
ticed an individual honor system and it was respected. You spoke
in class and your words, philosophic teachings, were believed You
ooh; in chapel and your worls were revered.

“’e’ll miss you, Dr. Lavell,,for you’re a part of us, and we
erely yours.
