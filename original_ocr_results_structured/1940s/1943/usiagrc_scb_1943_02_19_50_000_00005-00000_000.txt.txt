Monday night, Dibble was pushed
to the limit, barely squeezing out
a 15-14 victory. The game was
close all the way with Dibble
hanging on to a narrow lead most
of the way.

Rawson’s 14 point scoring
spree in the third quarter proved
too much for the Town Men in
the second game Monday. Town's
rally in the last quarter fell shor ,
21-13, giving Rawson their first
win of the season.

Town held off a fighting south
Read outtit Tuesday night for
their second win of the season.
The score was 20-15. North Read
also whipped their liallmates in a
tight defensive battle Wednesday
night by a score of 14-9. In the
second game that night, rRaWson
walked over smith, 23-17 to keep
the Carney residents in the cel-
lar. smith has five games left,
however, to pull out of their
slump.

Tenn-Dibble

In the only game last iiigiit,
Dibble put the bee to a bewild-
ered Town fiv-e, trouncing them
by the decisive margin of 39-15.
Town failed to pull out of its
trance until the second half was
well on its way, and suffered the
worst shellaeking of the current
season.

One more week remains in the
cage tourney and it’s anybody’s
fight for second place. With the
exception of Dibble. Clark alone
has seen its way through to win
over half of its games.

Registrar
Readies ERC

' Transcripts

Transcripts of the college l'er
cords of men in the ERC, Lin»
assigned, and a special in-
dividual qualification sheep
for each l'eservist are being
prepared in the offices of the
registrar and the dean of per-
sonnel, Dean Shelton L. Beat-
ty announced last night.

The records will be requir-
ed when the reservist is in-
ducted, rind should the ERC,
unassigned, be called up in
the near future their records
will be ready for them, said
Bedtty.

Although no announcement has
been made as to exactly when
ERC reservists will be called to
active duty, there are indications
that Grinnell’s reservists will {Er
ceive their orders somewhat earli-
er than was announced at the
beginning of the second semester,
ho said.

At the same time, Beatty stat-
ed that all men who are drafted
should obtain the same papers
before leaving for the induction
center, sinoe they facilitate an-
thorities in properly classifying
the inductee.

Emphasizing the value to men
in the service of keeping the col-
lege notified as to their location
proper address. Beatty pointed
out that all men leaving school
to enter Service would then be
able to receive the Alumni Scar-
let and Black.

The alumni paper will be of
especial interest to those reserv-
ists who are undergraduates, he
observed, since many of them plan
to return to Grinnell after their
discharge.

Friars Are Quiz-masters

Maybe it was the type of ques-
tions, maybe it was mike fright.
but it could have been sheer
superiority of Friars over faculty
that made the score of the quiz
program between those two teams
65-63 with the Friars on the big
endiby two points!

President Stevens out-sparked
the other members of the faculty
team, John w, Pooley, instructor
in economics and business, and
Grant 0. Gale, professor of phy-
Sl" He shot an almost perfect
answer to the question in several
parts concerning the cities in Rus-
sia which had or had not been re-
captured in recent battles. When
Cale said Kharkov had been taken
and was corrected by Moderator
Stuart. Gerry Brown, Stevens pro-
phesied that by the time the
morning papers were off the
press, Gale's answer would be cor-
rcct. Five minutes later word
was received at the studio that
Kharkov had just been recaptur-
ed according to the latest radio
bulletins.

Professor Paul Spencer Wood
of the English department sub-
mitted a question also corncern-
ing cities in the war news which
tailed to stump the Friars. Asked
which of the places named ap-
pear-ed in the war news or in
Gulliver's Travels, Jackson Kolp,
Bill Van Duzer, and Howard J.
Lurie managed to answer all but
one correctly.

it question concerning rank in
the U. s. Navy was contested by
the student team on which Lurie
and K011) are both naval reserv-

—A Buck from Stevens

ists. Kolp stated that the low-
est ofticer wearing a star to de-
note rank in the navy is a rear-
adniiral. Brown said the answer
submitted with the question was
an ensign. Friars claimed that
the ensign's star indicates combat
duty, not rank.

With a quarter fine for every
question missed going to the War
Chest, that organization collected
$1.75. Dr. Samuel N. Stevens,
who had placed a dollar bet that
the faculty would win, paid that
sum to the Chest also.
