Lineup +0 Gain

Grinncll's basketball hopeiuls will
he seeking their first win in four
starts when they tackle a tor-mid
able Augustana crew hci-e Satur—
day night in Darby gymnasium.

According to Coach (3. Lester
Duke, the vikings probably have
one o[ the best teams which will
appear on the local floor this
year.

Coach John Briley will start a
tall, rangy team against the Pies
neers, headed by Bryon Swedberg,
all conference football end, and
leading scorer of last year’s blue
and gold quintet. So for this sea—
son, Swedberg has hit for as
points in four games.

He will be aided and abetted
by Fred staack, six {out five inch
center, and Leroy Karlstrom, jun-
ior forward, who has 53 points to
his credit thus far this season.

Captain Louie Campanaro and
Bill Rinck, captain elect of Au—
gustana's 1943 football team.
round out the starting lineup,

So far this season, the Vikings
have won two and lost two. 0n

the black side of the ledger are
victories over Coe and wheaton,
but they have howed to Bradley
Tech 55-47, and to Cornell col-
lege, 5240,

In an attempt to give the F107
users more height, and consc-
quently more scoring punch, Duke
will move Harry Waters hack to
a guard position, and alternate
Joe Dyksti-a and Ev Sorey at the
pivot post.

Tex Kauffman, leading Grinnell
scorer, will see only limited sex-v»
ice due to the affects of a severe
cold, and Jack McCrane and
Brnme Vanstrum will probably
man the forward positions. Cape
train Edd Bowers will be at his
usual guard station.

Trailing A” ’rhe WayI
Pioneer Defense Can'+
Keep Oui‘ Long Sho+s

Grinhell took its worst beating of
the year at the hands of the Iowa
state Teachers' team Dec, 16 at
Cedar Falls. The Tutors ran up
a 1270 lead in the first six min-
utes of the contest before Hal
Robison broke the ice for the
Pioneers with a free throw.
Thereafter Grihhcll was never
able to close the gap, finishing
the game on the short end of a.
4-1-25 count,

The Teachers built up their 1270
lead mainly through long shots
and maintained it handily during
the first half. leaving the floor
with a 22-9 advantage.

After falling further behind at
the opening of the second half,
the Pioneers drove to within 1::
points in the third quarter, but
were unable to threaten further.

The use of a molded ball and
the old type baskets in the Tutor
gym were disadvantageous to
Grinnell in the game.

A return game with the
Teachers’ team is scheduled here
Jan. 14.
