Pioneers Seeking Vengeance Against Teachers

 

Grinnell Shoo’rs
For First Win
In Five S’rarl-s

Grillnell will be trying to break
into the win column for the first
time in five Starts against Iowa
State Teachers here Thursday
night. The Tutors licked Grin-
ncll adezs in a game played De-
cember 13 at Cedar Falls, and
Grinnell will strive to even up
the series on it; home {1001:

The Teachers bring to Grin—

nell a veteran team which uses
the fast break consistently with
Titsworth and Seidler doing most
of the scoring, Although the
Teachers have compiled an im-
pressive record so far this sea-
son, they have faced tough com-
petition. In its last two games
the Tutor team has lost to Iowa

State by one point and North
Dakota by three points.

After Grinnell's startling vic—
tory over Iowa State, the Pion-
eers have failed to Win, althngh
the games have been close save
the previous Tutor encounter, G.
Lester Duke said the team was
tired of losing rclose ones and was
going out to win Thursday,
’Tex’ Kaufman, sophomore for-
ward, who was unable to play
much of the Augustana game be—
cause of flu will undoubtedly see
plenty of action Thursday. Duke
also said he would continue to
use Waters at guard, leaving the
center duties to Sory and Dyk-
stra.

The probable starting lineup:

Grinnell—
. Kaufman
. Mcorane
. Sory or Dykstra
. Kennefick
. Bowers

—Commandos

The Gl-inncll Commandos, stnited
less than a week ago, received its
first member early this week, ac-
cording to John c. 'Irucsdale,
sponsor of the program. William
Fiirdlcy, Smith junior, completed
the requirements to gain this
honor.

The Commandos, a by_product
of the conditioning classes, is cs.
sentially a set of physical achieve
merits toward winch approximate
ly two hundred college men are
striving.

The requirements consist of a.
severe swimming test, strength
tests, and a timed endurance test.

Fifty_two men completed the re-
quired number of pusnups this
week and fortyrflve climbed the
rope in twenty seconds. Sixteen
men have run the obstacle course
in the required two_and a half
minutes. Only four have passed
this swimming tests while the life.
saving test has been met by only
two men.

Beating ihe
Brush

By Scott Mills

Grinnell basketball marches ahead
with the first basketball games in
the new gym. The move from the
little, old, red gym to the Madison
Square Garden of Central Iowa
is surely an improvement. Yet the
now humble, old gym ‘had its
day‘ many times since its erection
in 1399. In its youth the gym’s
basketball floor was considered
so large by opposing teams that
they insisted on playing it width-
wise.

In 1900 Grinncll started playing
intercollegiate basketball by
sweeping through a five game
schedule undefeated This started
a “golden era" of Gl‘lllnell basket
ball. During the first fifteen years
of play Grinltcll compiled an
amazing number of wins against
competition which included Iowa,
Minnesota, and Drake.

In those days the possession of
a outrofrballnds ball was won by
the team whose man got it first.
As a result the spectators often
became partially entangled in the
game. A basketball game in a
men’s gym was not considered
quite a proper place for women
in those faregone days.

After 1915 the Pioneer cagers
entered a 15-year slump. In about
1920 Grinnell joined the Missouri
Valley conference which then in<
eluded Iowa State, Missouri, and
Kansas State.

Around 1930, however, the
Pioneers began to pick up and
compiled a fine rccord both with-
in and without the conference un-
til our dropping out in 1938. In
this period the feats included a
split in the last twelve games
played with the Oklahoma Aggies
and the defeat of a Butler team

Conditioning Fails
For 56 Per Cen’r

After tabulatiiig the strength
tests of half the men in Grinncll
it has been found that fiftyrslx
per cent have not improved no»
ticeably in strength from a se-
mestci- of activity in conditioning,
John c. Trucsdale, professor of
physical education, announced tor
day. Some have actually grown
weaker, he said.

Those that have improved con—
siderably are divide;d into three
groups, Truesdale announced.
Four per cent are seventy»five
per cent better; fourteen per cent
have gained by at least half; and
twenty-five per cent are between
twentysfive and fifty per cent
stronger.

Truesdalc stressed the fact that
p e r f o r m a n c e in conditioning
classes is strictly up to the indi»
vidual, who can work just about
as much as he wants to. Some of
those who improved most were
weakest at the start. and some
who are strongest now have not
improved at all, he added.

Grinliell’s second year in tlie
Mi swest brought a co-champion-
ship. Last year the Pioneers cap-
tured third place. Now we start
a new season with a new gym, a
new coach, and some new boys.
Yet the old Grinncll spirit remains
the same.

Inability of GI'ilmell's Pion-
eel's to capitalize on their
close shots cpst them another
heartbreaking defeat, as they
bowed to AllEllStalla 33-31
here Saturday night.

Gl‘inncll Spill'ted to a 9-3
lead eeil'ly ill the game, but
ﬁltered in the face of Angus-
tanéi’s fireewhgon attack, and
the Vikings swept into a 1779
advantage with four minutes
of the half l'emainingi

Free throws by Waters and
Vanstrum moved the scarlet and
black up to within 6 points of the
Illinqls quintet, but a charity toss
by Rinck and a field goal by Cam—
panaro increased the Augustana
margin, and they sported a 22-15
edge at the half.

Aided and abetted by Ev Sory,
who poured in 6 quick points, the
Pioneers fought back, and knotted

the score at 27-all with ten minut-
es lcit in the final period.

Byron Swedberg put the Vik-
ings out in front 29-27 With a long
set shot,- but Brunie Vanstrum's

two free throws again evened the
game 29-29, with five minutes of
play remaining.

Rinck hit on a hook shot from
the corner, and Campanaro tallied
two gratis shots to give the gold
and blue a four point lead, and
they held Grlnnell at bay until the
final grin when Waters sent home
a push sliot.

chdberg and LeRoy Karlstrom
needed the Augustana offensive
with eight points cach, while Van-
struin and Harry Waters split
Pioneer scoring honors with seven
counters apiece.
