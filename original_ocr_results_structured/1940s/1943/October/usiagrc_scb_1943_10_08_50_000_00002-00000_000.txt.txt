Advice Fo' Chill'un - -

It has been customary for many years to
print, in the fil‘st'lssue of the Scarlet and
Black, a formal welcome to the freshman
class. This year that custom was not proc—
ticedﬁthough there was no design in the
omission. It simply seemed that a formal
welcome was rather unfitting for the open—
ing week of school, itself such a happy
and informal time. Secondly, the veritles
of the ages tend to become trite with rep<
etition, and an unfelt welcome of.words
is far inferior to an activated welcome of

fact. So the “Welcome to Preps“ went by .

the board.

It would appear after a month of school
that such an omission was an error, for
we are now moved to print comment under
the more foreboding title of “Advice."

The class of 1947 hasn‘t asked for ad-
vice. Perhaps they don’t want it. But
with sincere good wishes for their own
success at Grinnell, we hope they will listen
to it. What action they take after having
been exposed to advice, isaas all questions

of personal conduct must lac—strictly up
to them.

First of all, a definition of the position
of freshmen here may be helpful. Quite
frankly, the following definition is taken
from the upperclass point of view. Don’t
outlaw it on that ground alone. As curs
rent upperclassmen remember their
days they find the point of view which sen-
iors had toward them is largely what they
now have toward you. That ought to prove

something-rest least it has the virtue of‘

time; and use.

The prepping system is not the Spanish
Inquisition modernized. It also has no lineal
descent from the Salem witcheburnings, and
is not first cousin to a Nazi concentration
camp.

The more important of the two words
is “system," not “prepping.” It is a sys»

until next fall and see how quickly you can

no breeze. Secondly, it’s a system to connect

with the occupation of Teros and
shmos and the battle for Cos in
progress, we, of the great unme
formed, are given a peek behind
,the curtain which veils the Allied
master strategy.

The attack on the Dodecanese
is aimed at securing a base for
operations against the Balkans.
Not the attack itself. but the tim-
mg of the attack, gives us a clue
to the nature of the master plan,
This attack. timed to coincide
with the cessation or the Russian
summer campaign, forces Hitler
to a. perimeter defense rather than
the one-well defense he would like
so well.

We would miss the real point
of this bit of news if we failed
to realize its relation to Turkey.
The fact that Turkey remains
neutral and names us into an ex-
pensive campaign for a. base from
which to attack the Balkans,
means that to some peoples we do
not look like the Messianic hope
we otter. take ourselves to be.
Maybe the Turks are just myopic.
Maybe we could do with e little
more clarity in our statement or
war and peace aims as they apply
to the small nations of Europe
and the Near East.

People are so prone to say,
“Look, we are winning the war!
Let the happy morons who dream
of world order and world peace
plans have their fun." I: it not
possible that a great many very
real British and American lives
might be saved by just such state
ments as the happy morons are
dishing out? It is certainly true
in this case.
