Stick Around, Chum

With the news and rumor that the Enlisted
Reserve Corps, unassigned, is to be called
out of school, many men are planning dras-
tic action. Some want to leave school now;
some wish to leave at the end of the se-
mester; many plan just to slide until the
day of induction arrives. '

It is our opinion tllat you E. R. C ers
should snap out of it and stick around Gllnr
nell. .
If you remember the purpose of the re-
serve corps—to keep men in college as long
as possible~you may change your mind.
There has been no final decision made, nor
have any of you received your-induction
papers. When and if the army decides to
call you out, you’ll know it—from the gov-
ernment.

But the army wants you here as long as
possible Otherwise it would‘not have gone
to the trouble of setting up reserve pro—
grams. It is interested in the credits you
have and intend to get. Those of you ma—
joring in fields useful to army technicians
may well be allowed to stay longer than
you think. If others are called, all hours
you have will be to your credit.

If, on the other hand, you leave at the
semester, you will automatically be taken
into the army: any resolve member who
removes himself from college is put into
the ranks. If you stay for the beginning of
next semester you may have a good chance
of finishing it. It takes quite a while to call
all the men outithere is a lot of paper
work to be done in conjunction with such a
move. All reserves cannot possibly be hair
died at once. You may drop out only to
find you wouldn't have been called at all.
Also, after your army days are over, rer
member that employers are interested to
know how much college credit you have.

So, in view of all the benefits you can
get by remaining in college why don’t you
think twice before you drop out necessarily.
Stick around, fellows.

Oh. For a Name

We thought the fight was over, but no.

Once again the Grinnell student body
has a recreation center. The place is well
arranged and managed. Already students
are beginning to express pride in it. But
“it” cannot go on being called the student
recreation center. That’s not a name. It’s
a generic term.

The White House sign painted by Ken
Shoulberg for the former recreation spot,
now in use by the officers’ candidate school,
still hangs on that building. It is assumed
we must find another name.

We find it hard to believe that army
administrative officers in Grinnell have be-
come firmly attached to the name which
they have inherited along with the building
housing post headquarters. Perhaps they
would not mind relinquishing the title in
the name of Grinnell tradition.

In the event that the army would sorely
regret giving up the picturesque title,
perhaps some student organiaztion should
sponsor a contest to find a suitable new
name for our new quarters.

But let’s do give the student recreation
center a more endearing name; it deserves
that. ‘

army tradition, officer candidates
of Companies B and c passed in
review the morning of Dccsmtcr

didates of Company A.

of tile snow-covered, gale-swept

occasion. Officers of the faculty,
their wives and friends were pres—
ant, and Witnessed the tribute of
the under graduates as they
marched past their fellow candi-
dates, so soon to depart for serv-
ice in every quarter of the globe

ing.

Special commendation was an-
nounced to the companies after
the ceremony, for the splendid
manner in which the review was
performed. The rcsultn of many
hours of intensive cicsc order drill
were evidenced in tho precismn
with which the ranks passed the
reviewing stand.

plete the rigorous course of in-
struction at the school, one o”
several established last Septem-
