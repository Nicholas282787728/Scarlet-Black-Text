Baskelball Schedule,
Wresl‘ling Tournamen’r
Will Begin First Week

The Intramural Board voted che
nesday night to suspend men
intramural activrties until the be-
ginning of next semester, John
c. Truesdale, intramural director
announced yesterday. The basket-
ball schedule and wrestling tour-
nament have both been postponed
and will probably begin the first
week or the second semester hc
said.

Approaching tests and uncer-
tainty about the status of the
men's halls next semester were
cited as the .prinicpal reasons for
the action. A large drop 'in en—
rollment might make it impos-
sible for all halls to compete efr
iectively in intramurals. This may
also necessitate the consolidation
of some of the men's halls, he
said.

The board decided to postpone
any action on the coming basket-
ball season until they could ob-
tain more definite information
about the enrollment next s mes—
ter. If possible, each hall will
provide two basketball teams for
competition as in the past. With
the new gym facilities, it will be
possible also to hold two games
at once, using two east—west
courts on the new floor, each
court being approximately the
size of the old gym floor, accord-
ing to Truesdale.

Gadabout carnival. The cottages

tation in starting war stamp
hooks, according to Miss Berg-
lund. '
