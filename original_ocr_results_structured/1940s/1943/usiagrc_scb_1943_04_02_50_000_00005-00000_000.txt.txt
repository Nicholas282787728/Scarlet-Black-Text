BEATING THE BRUSH

by Scoil Mills

Chuck Hoyt, former star track-
man at Grinnell and now track
coach at Yale on leave oi ab-
sence tor the duration, t‘cld me
a few things the other day
about track at Grinnell in his
time.

Genial, Slim, and fit, Hoyt had
coached Michigan's track team
to the Big Ten championship in
seven out of ten years before
guiding Yale to the Ivy league
championship in each of the last
{cur years.

In 1916 Hoyt, a Grinnell sopho-
more, entered the special invita-
tional 220 yd. dash in the-Drake
relays and established a world’s
record for that event Hoyt won
the 100 and 220 yd. championships
in the Big Ten meet which was
then open to all colleges. In fact
during his eleven years of track
competition Hoyt last only two
races.

Hoyt’s coach at Grinnell, Doc
Huff, competed in the 1908

With 27 thlnclads going through
their paces daily, Coach G. Les—
ter Duke's hopes for a successful
track season have taken a de-
cidedly rosier hue.

However, only four lettermen
are present and accounted for
from last year’s crack squad,
which was hard hit by gradua-
tion, Monogram winners now re-
porting are Captain Bob Cam'-
gan, hurdler; Dean Newell, high
jumper; Ed Sory, javelin; and
Harry waters, sprinter.

To brighten the picture, Duke
has seven veterans hack in the
{old on which he can call. Jack
Mankey, Gene McCurdy, Wally
Seidlitz, Ted Stamford, and Koert
Voorhees each have a year's ex-
perience behind them, and Ed
Nagel and Dave Matlaok have a
service record of two seasons.

Men trying on the spikes for
the first time, but who may be
pushing the veterans for team
berths are 'Edd Bowers, John
Dooley, Joe Dyhstra, Phil Hal-
lie, John Hatakedo, Bill Lun<
dahl, Lee Mann, a1 Mecham,
Roger McIntosh. and Jerry strong.

Ed Keller, Bill Brown, Scott
Mills, Jack Peregcy, Ralph Hart,
and Bob Muyskensl

Olympics, Morgan Taylor was
coached by Hoyt in high school
befure he made a brilliant rec-
0rd at Grinnell and subsequently
competed in me Olympics of
'24, '28, and '32, becoming world
champion in the 400 meter hur—
dies.

Hoyt said, "In my days of track
at Grinnell there were 50 or 60
boys out for track, many of whom
trained all winter for the traclt
season. The sport in which Grim
nell stood out was track." He
added concerning the present sit-
uation, “There is no better prep—
aration for the armed services
than track work which streng-
thens legs and wind. Track work—
outs take no longer than con-
ditioning periods, and a definite
goal is always present. Conse-
quently there is a real motive
to get in good shape."
