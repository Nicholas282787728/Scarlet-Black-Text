Gibbs Prays for Rink F ands

Troubles like those bounding poor.
youthful freshman class president
Jim Gibbs shouldn't happen to a
dog.

Every other campus organiza-
tion and man of campus affairs
was afraid to handle the much.
talked.about college iced-ink pro.
ject. Consequently, it was suggest-
ed to the head of the yearlings
that his class sponsor the "Sure.
fire, moneyemnkmg project."
Gibbs and his classinen assented,
it was then that their troubles
began,

Soon the inoney.i-aislng cam.
paign was launched, twenty-five
big, round, shiny dollars being the
goal. That was the sum which the
city firemen told Gibbs that they
wanted in return for the job of
flooding the nortn tennis courts.

But twenty.five dollars is quite
a sum to be gathered for ice.skat_
ing privileges, at two bits a thrc
from college studentsial. least s
quite a sum to collect from Grin-
nell college students.

And then there-s the weather.
Weather is quite an element in the
planning of an ice rink, Gibbs

 

Nafive Balinese—

Devi-Dia Booked For Salurday

The Grinnell College concert se—
ries presents as its first program
of the new year DevleDja and her
Bali-Java dancers on Saturday
evening, Jan. 16, at eight o'clock
in the high school auditorium.

The company is accompanied by
native musicians who play the exe
otic woodwinds and many-toned
gongs of the rhythm gamelan
orchestra which pilgrims to Bali
have heard in the great temple
courts and in the lavish native
festivals. .

According to the custom of Bali
and Java, the dancers accompany
certain of their dances With song,
and the musicians, seated on the
stage, take part in the dance
dramas. They bring elaborate cose
tumcs and trappings from the
original settings of their dance
for these performances.

The dance recital will consist
of thirteen temple dances, rang-

ing from “Tandak,” the court
dance of Javanese princes, to a
modern Javanese dance, written
by Devi-Dia and inspired by the
frescoes in the famous Temple of
Borohudur.

In a recent issue of the Na
tional Geographic magazine an
article on Bali says: ”With every
picture of Bali also imagine a
background of music. Rippling
rhythm, the music of the gamelan
resembles modern ‘swlng.’ We
watched Balinese dances as dif—
ferent in spirit and movement as
the Blue Danube and Benny Good-
man’s adaptations."

The BalirJava dancers have just
completed an engagement at thc
Civic Opera house in Chicago. Ad-
mission for the Grinnell program

admission tickets, $1.65 including
tax. A special price of so cents
has been arranged for soldiers.

saysiespecially when the weath.
er is to determine how long each
student may skate in return for
his two bits.

And already, Gibbs is having
trouble with the city fire depart-
ment. Are the water pipes which
now lead to Lhe tennis courts ade.
quate for the flooding job, or must
another method be devised?

tennis courts are too small, says
the commissioner. They will freeze
before enough water runs out to

trying.

Now there remains a third al.

light left in lives of freshman
comittee members.

But this too will take money.

look on his face, "pleaseiall you

‘Rule Changed for Men
in Prep School To Aid
V-l Enlistmenls

Ill 21 new war-time move,
Grinnell College plans to al-
loW high school seniors to en-
ter Grinnell in the middle
of their senior year, before
high school graduation, Dean
Shelton Beatty announced to-
day. .

Students thus admitted must

be in the top oneehalf of their
class. i

The move is the result of a
plan approved by the National
Educational Association with
which the college is co—operating,

and is designed purely as a war-
time measure, Behtty said.

It applies especially to appu-
cants for the Navy v-1 enlisted
reserve, who have a sound math-
ematical background, and who
must be enrolled in college be-
fore March 15, in order to com-
pleto their enlistincnt. For Grin.
ncll, this means that the New
V71 enlistees from high school
must enter study here before
January 25, the opening day of
the new semester, according to
Beatty.

This move was made necessary
by the terms of a new directive,
under which 17 year old high
school seniors are eligible for v-1
eiilistinents only if they have
been accepted by and accredited
institution for a term commenc-
ing not later than March 15m.
A student who is not in attend-
ance at an approved institution
prior to March 16th, may not be
enlisted in class V-l, U. S. 0., Na-
