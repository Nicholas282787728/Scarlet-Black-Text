If the Shoe Fi+s---

Once upon a time there was a college. It
had students, The students liked the col-
lege, and consequently they had lots “of
school spirit. They went to basketball games
and cheered when the cheerleaders told
them to cheer. Sometimes they cheered all
by themselves.

The college had a-college band. The band
played at all the basketball games, The
band played loud at the basketball games
because when the students heard the music
they developed even more school spirit than
they usually had. Everybody stood up when
they played the school song because that
was the proper thing to do. Everybody sang
the first verse and chorus of the school
song, and then bummed the rest because
they couldn’t remember the words. The
students -didn’t care especially, since as
school songs go, it was a pretty good school
song, even if they didn’t know all the words,
‘ But trouble roused its ugly head, There
was a radical on the campus who did not
like the old school songi Digging back into
the musty records, the radical discovered
that there was a new school song. It was a
peach, He bummed it several times, and it
sounded swell. The song had been written
by a famous orchestra leader, and it was
good all the way through, The radical said
to himself, “Students won’t 'mind learning
the words to this song if the band will

learn to play it." And then the radical hum-
med it a little more. It was a very good
song. It had punchy lines, solid lyrics, and
hadn’t accumulated any moss along its
edges. In fact, there was no reason at all
why it shouldn’t become very popular. The
college band knew how to play “Praise The
Lord and Pass The Ammunition” When the

GRINNELL SCA‘RLET AND BLACK

band played, everybody clapped their hands
and sang. It had lots of spirit.

The new school song had lots of spir‘ ,
too, The students would soon learn all the
words if the band played it often enough.
During wartime, the radical decided, a
school needs lots of spirit if it wishes to
survival If the students learned the words
in time, they could go marching into battle
singing their school song. Who knows, may-
be the collegc could become world famous
just because of that one song. Marines could
sing it, sailors, too. The Army, in self de-
fense, would be forced to think of a new
arrangement and beat them both, The
WAACS and the WAVES and the SPARS
and the WIRES and the WOWS could all
learn it. It might become number one on
the Hit Parade. It might sell more copies
than any other song in the country. Dinah
Shore and Bing Crosby, with a chorus of
1,000 voices, might make a record in fact,
almost anything might happen.

Why not give it a chancelll‘ll‘l

To ﬁle Eagle-—- ‘

It’s hard to send people you know and love
out to die. That's what is behind the so-
called war hysteria of any generation. We
mask it with glittering terms, like “patri~
otism” or “honor” or “devotion to duty,”
Mostly we refuse to face the realities of
the situation. We shun terms that are cold
and dark and lonesome. We never say
“death" or “pain.” We say instead “if worse
comes to worse" or “if anything should
happen" or "if some of them don‘t come
back, . . ."

‘ We bluff,

Paul Brown didn‘t bluff. The Scarlet and
Black reprints» with reverence, with plide,
and with a sense of personal remembrance,
the thoughts of that Glinnell man else-
where in this issue. We print them not just
because he was brave and we knew him,
but because we think those simple words
are the credo of an honest man, fighting.
They are the words of a man who was to
become, in his way, famous; who was to be
put among the gallant, the able and the
fine of his generation, Yet when he left
this country, he was a man who was home
sick, a man who would fight—not for an
abstract term or an abstract way of life,
but for the chance to come home again ”to
the best wife and family and friends in the
good old U, S, A,"

And that‘is what we believe most of this
country’s fighting men really feel when
they go off to war. We honor Paul Brown
because he said it. We honor him because
he was a man whose bravery was beyond
challenge on the fields of war, and whose
humanity was as great as his skill.

To The Editor:

The sportsmanship at the last
basketball game was abominable.
When we Grinnellians start riding
our own basketball team it’s
time to quit. In the past we
have cheered them on to victory
and have praised them in defeat,

but not now! We shout and
ridicule oneman’s playing until
that man is ready to give up.
Constructive criticism is flne.’
but when that criticism turns
into a bedlam of screaming for
someone else to take another
man’s place, then it's time for
that man to politely Walk to Lhe
stands, and choose the said char-
acter, or wait until after the
game. Either, to our mind, is
permissable.

When Grmncll plays again, who»
ever ii. may be, let‘s try to make
it a game of basketball and note
gladiator’s duel in the Roman
arena.

this need. This is the first time
in the history of Grinnell college
that students have been asked to
contribute through college church.

ternational, non-seqtarian, and
non~political, believes that the
