of thc best games of the season.
and the team showed that old
Pioneer spirit even though much
of the student body didn't show
it by not being there.

It seems a shame that our
basketballsquad, handicapped by
few men and inexperience, and
our magnificent new gym should
go unappreciated. Enthusiasm for
athletic teams has been always
one of the main expressions of
tlic Grinnell spirit. our teams
have had their ups and downs for
a half century, but that wholca
heartcd support for the team has
seldom flagged,

Saturday the Pioneers play
their last game of the season and
probably for the duration. Let’s
make this last home game a
noisy, stimulating affair and show
the team there are real Pioneers
watching too.
