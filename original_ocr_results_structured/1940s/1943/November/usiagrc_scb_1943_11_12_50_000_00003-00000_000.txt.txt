GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

For Instance

By Dave Sparks 1

 

There are among us. many whtJi
firmly maintain and sincerely besi
lieve that a [oi-eign policy such
as we are now tolllbwing in our
relations With the various gavel-lie
mentsdirexilc and with the under-
ground movements in the con-
quered territories ivill eventually
lead to a fultillment of our hopes
for a world where peace is the
rule, not the exception. Are these
people Just misguided or do they
have an insight not available to
the dissenters?

The dcalinga of the state Dav,
partment with the pro-Vichy ele-
ments in North Africa, the behind
the scene conspiring, the granting
of privilige and use of discrime
ination certainly looks like any-
thing but the realization of our
ideas as expressed in the Atlantic
Charter we must not forget that
we cannot afford to condone the
prostitution of our cause for the
temporary and dubious value of

, military expediency.

The odor arising from the pres-i
ent Greek and Yugoslavian stew
is largely from the Anglo-Amer
can intervention In Yugoslavia,
two groups fight the Nazrs, the
Partisans Drug Trio and the Ghet-

mks under Draja Mihailovichu

'Both groups have been fighting a

guerrilla war that has been exe
tremely effective in crippling the
German attempts to consolidate
their conquests in the Balkans,
But besides fighting the Germans
these two groups are fighting each
other. Increasing strife, caused in
a large measure by United Nation
intervention and favoritlsm to one
side or another, has accentuated
the problem to the point where
seventeen Ghetnihs were executed
by the Partisans, for TREASON.
The lack of purpose becomes even
more evident when one remembers
that Hitler considers each of
them equally dangerous to Ger-
rriany. as evidenced by his offer of
100,000 gold marks for each 01

in Greece the odor is even
stronger that it is in Yugoslavia
The liberation group or the A E

mcnts to the effect that it would
sponsor a national plebiscite tor

the expulsion of the Germans, tor-
the purpose of determining the
Greek type of government, be it
republican or nionarchial. Ranged
against this group is King George

to choose the form of governmenti
under which they will live." Iti
seems to be our policy to allow.

\siich fine expressions of a hope;

and an ideal to be buried under,
the rather shady and vague ideat
of military expediency

Need this futile slaughter, this:
internal strife, this squandering or
sorely needed power continue. Are
we to suffer another period of.
chaos simply because we have not
now the courage of our convic»
tiolls? Do we not understand the
cause we are bound to by the
Atlantic Charter. That we have
stated our aims clearly and have
then followed them through hell
and high water has been one of
the toundations of our way of life
as opposed to the Nazi doctrine of
deceit. Have we been so conquered
by the Fascist thought to believe
that fighting the Nazi way is the
only way to ﬁght? Far better to
admit that we are only fighting
to preserve the pre—war status of'
Europe and go on in our present
course than to claim humanitarian
and enlightend ideals and then
muddy up our reputation with T57
pudi tion of those ideals by our
actions

By “Father" Deﬁne-—

Reveille is the bane of all slcop
loving soldiers, and as the days
grow shorter and the nights he
come longer and colder. mat early
morning call is increasingly unr
popular, Nobody on the campus
besides the industrious student
who gets up to study and myself
who enjoys his tour-teen hour
beauty rest as much as anyone
could, realizes just how darn it
is and how bitter cold the Wind
oft the corn fields can be.

or course, there is a difference
of opinion on whether it is really
as cold as it seems. There are
ieilcws like Bill (Fenby) Fry. who
wander out to reveille in their
shirt sleeves and say, "We call
this weather summer in Bowdmn."
But then there are the southere
hers who believe that when the
“paleface” came to Iowa, he was
tighting Eskimos not Indians.

There is no controversary on
how dark it is; everyone agrees.
Just last night Richard Butters
jumped out of bed, got his rooms
niate, Ev ward up, finished dress-
ing, and ran down the hall at 1
o’clock in the morning because he
thought he had heard the reveille
call, We all agree though that he
should have known bettel'iit's
lighter outside at one in the
morning than it is at reveille,
