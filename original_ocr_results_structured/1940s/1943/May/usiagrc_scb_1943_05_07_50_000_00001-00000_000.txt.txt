'Former Decision

About Comps

Junior men attempting to finish
their academic work this spring-
by writing the regular fourryedr
comprehensive examinations, will
be required to undergo course ex»
aminations in all but their ma-
jor subject.

This is the final decision of
the faculty and administration
of Grinnell college, announced
after a faculty meeting Monday,
May 3.

A similar
been made

annoucement
by the

had
Registrar’s

Advisory committee earlier,
prompting a petition trom the
student body to Dr. Stevens and
the general faculty for B. lacon-
sideration of the problem,

The petition submitted by the
student council, was given to
Stevens Monday afternoon at
two o’clock, to be presented by
him in the faculty meeting.

Presenting the case of the
students involved, the petition
called attention to the already
unequal status of junior men,
who, with only three years.of
preparation, will take senior com-
prehensive examinations. It also
noted that the courses not af-
filiated with majors are, this
year. mainly science'and math
courses required by the armed

forces reserves. These courses,
the petition said in part, will re-
quire a majority of the student’s
review time, since they are not
affiliated with his major field
of interest.

The absence of a reading period
before final exams was also men»
tioned.

In discussion in an earlier fac»
ulty meeting, before the advisory
committee’s action, the monthly
grade report required by the
government for all reservists had
been classd as a sufficiently aor
curate and timely check on the
standing of a man in his class.

In denying the student petition,
no statement was offered by
members of the factulty in answer
to points raised in that document.
