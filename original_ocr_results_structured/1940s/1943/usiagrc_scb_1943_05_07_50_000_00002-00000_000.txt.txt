Now Is the Time--

Conspicuous by its absence on the Grinnell
campus is an honor system for examinations.
The reputation of Grinnell is one of integrity
and fair play. It is doubtful tllat we can
blanieithe war for cheating that is present
both in examinations and in written work
in class and out. This unhealthy condition
existed long before we were beset by war.
True, there has been agitation by several
groups on the campus through the years for
the establishment of an honor system. Some
thing always happened to the good inten—
tions and they fell by the wayside.

Next year is an ideal time to institute
Such a system and ingrain it into the fold

GRINiNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

01' Grinnell tradition. The re sons are easily
comprehended. Firs, there will be fewer
student on campus than there would he in
normal years. \ ith a smaller body to work
with in honor system could more easily
be ini ted and adhered to. If such a procer
(lure became tradition in a ”lean” year, it
would be THE rule for neu students to fol»
low When the influx came after the war.
Secondly, it may be easiei lor a predominate-
ly feminine student body to initiate an honor
system, but of course With the help of the
men on campus.

An honor system \lhich did not work
praglnatically \\ould be nothing- more than
a hollow shell and a standing lolcc. In order
to be effective, such a tradition MUST be
supported and administered by one groupi
the entire student body. Under a Grinnell
honor system, a cheater mllst feel the whole—
hearted condemnation and disrespect of his
follows, There are few people who could have
such a stigma and keep their heads in the
air.

Two facts are lamentable, namely: that
there is cheating in the type of classes which
are the rule in Grinnellismall, personalized
classes; secondly, that the student body has
not been strong enough to initiate such a
remedy as is called for by the existence of
the malignant problem. The time is close
at hand whereby the ”duration" students
can make a real contribution to the tradi ion
and the future of Grinnell College. The Si no-
tion is present. The materials for its solu-
tioll, an honor system for examinations mak—
ing pl-ofessorial vigilence unnecessary, are
at the fingertips 01' the student body. 1‘: is
up to you to mold the ingredients into a
lasting contribution for common good.

The qucstion as to whether or not
sex is a current problem at Grin-
men will be decided once and for
all when the Friars and the stu—

dent council tear the lid off of
their neatly wrapped package of
entertainment come May 15.

According to Howard J, Lurie,
president of the Friars and Miss
Marilyn McCool potentate of the
stoodent council, the Faculty Fool-
ies will depict many or the behind
the scenes episodes of faculty
existence.

In a enlightening interview with
your reporter, Miss McCool ejac-
‘tuléted, “Even the Poolies are in
the Faculty Foolies”.

silent on the affair, stating that
it was his constitoootional right to
remain quiet on the subject until
he had consulted n lawyer.

Members of thc pedagoical staff
of Grinncll also voiced their sen-
Liments strongly.

Shelton L. Bentty, Dean of Pet.—
sonnel administration, stated to
the assembled cast at the Foolles,
“Anything you say will be used
against you."

Frederick Llewelyn Baumann,
associate professor of history, was
heard to remark thusly; “My dear
young Christian rricnds. . , . how
I hate you all,"

Joseph w. Charlton. when asked
his opinion as to whether or not
the Show would be c success, rc-
plied, “Well, now, it could go
either way. You Just can't tell

“Well, ah," reported Pioneer
mentor G Lester Duke, when
qucstioned as to his feeling to
ward the Foolies.

The Hermits, proteges of the
Friars and pcssibic embryo Friars
oi the future, chcrnscd, “or course
its a good show. Better than that,
it stupendous, collosal, magnifi»
cent, and mediocre, In fact it
is probably the best production to
ever hit this campus."

who clutched in one hand a cat-

of the material to be used in the
