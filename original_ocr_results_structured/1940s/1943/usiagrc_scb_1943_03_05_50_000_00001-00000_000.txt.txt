‘ Harts Kohn Outlines Pence Bcised on

The Complete Disarmament

Controversial as some points of Hans Kolln’s lectllles may
have been, ollt of those lectures came olle point on which all
listeners seemed willing to agree: the necessity for the per-
servation of collaboration between the United States, tlle

B ish empire, and U. S. S. R., both during the “'3'

the peace.

On the basis of its general
acceptance, this theory must
be considered as the most suc-
cessful» of the series. It ap-
peared in all of Dix Kolln’s
lectures, and in the comments
he made for a Grinnell college

broadcast Tuesday.

it was reiterated indirectly in
his repeated pleas for unity
among the allies, the preserva-
tion of our nuclear “United Na-
Lions" organization, and protec-
tion of peace through the union of
peaceful power after hostilities
have ceased.

‘Power in itself is not bad,"
Kohn said last night, ‘Powel‘
can be used in ways of evil or
ways of good. It is my opinion
that power in the hands of the
United Nations after the war will
be used for the ultimate good;
and mat the preservation of
strength in the union of Britain,
Russia, and the United states
will be the best preservation of
peace."

Unconditional Surrender
stemming from Kohn's insistr
ence on the development of the
United Nations is his seven-point
peace plan It encompasses first,
the uncon onal surrender and
complehi disarmament of Ger-
many and Japan;
‘ Second, reparations to the no.
tions which have been conquered
or harmed by Germany and in.
pan through the appropriation of
controlling blocks of stock in the
major industries of these two nai-
tions.

Third, The establishment of in-
ternational economic boards to
achieve a freer tradeiflrst step
toward the goal of free trade.

Fourth, the inclusion of mini-
mum bills of rights in the con-
stitution at all nations.

Measles Ra'ging in Quad:
Soldiers Are Quarantined
The measles epidemic is still rag-
ing, with a total of fifteen cases
up to date, according to Miss
Evelyn Gardner, dean of wom-
en.

Although the army has only
one case. colonel De Haven of
the Des number two announced
last night that all army men
will be quarantined this week-
end.

The military ball scheduled for
March 13 will be held unless the
epidemic becomes worse, Miss
Gardner stated.

sixth, the establishment of zui

triesiespecially China. and Bra
leﬁas they qualify,
international court of arbitration
and justice, decisions of which
would be enforceable, if neces-
sary, by the armies of the Unit-
ed Nations, no United Nations
army being existent.

Realistic Approach

“We must approach this peace
realistically,” Kohn said. "It will
not be the peace you or I or any
student of history might wish. It
must be politically acceptable, not
an ideally acceptable peace; and
one which will meet the approv~
al of Joseph Stalin, the Senate
of the United states, and the
Parliament of England.

“01 course, there will have to
bo compromises, but it is the pe-
culiar gift of the Anglo-Saxon
people to compromise. We shall
not- reach our iinal goal in 1543,
or 1946, or even in the lifetime of
my youngest listener. But we
shall keep it before us, as a star,
and “‘0 shall work on through
pitfalls to reach it."

Best example of the “star-[ol-
lowing” technique was given by
Kohn as the consttiutional bills
of rights for all nations. “These
bills of rights are not going to
be always and properly enforced.
But to include them in the na»
tional constitutions at least gives
us the start. The day in which
they are enforced is our goal."

still anybody's battle, and cam—
