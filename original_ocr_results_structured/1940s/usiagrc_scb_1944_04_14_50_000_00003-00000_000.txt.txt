Success

The pl-oducloll of “Sister
Beatrice” April 1 and 2, in
A R H andltoilum was
easily up to, and £211 sill»
passed, the expectations
plompted by Kent Andr'ews
pl’OmlSe of a good show.

All those who weie fortunate
enough to see the play agreed that
it was the best performance they
had ever seen in Grinnell.

in the first place, the scenery
was the most elaborate that has
been used as far baclr as anyone
can remember. The set was con»
structed by the class in Introduc-
tion to the Theatre. The finish»
ed set looked professional. When
the curtains parted, the audience
was amazed at the realistic ap-
pearance of the grey stone wallsl
of the convent. it was hard tt‘
believe that an actual portion of
a middle-age French convent had
not been placed on the auditorium
stage.

The costumes, also made by the
drama class, had, like the scenery
a professional look. They were de-
signed by Maxine Hay and Ann
Hellebusch. who both displayed
an ability to adapt the authentic
conventional religiouus garb for a
student production. One might
have thought that real nuns oer
cupied the stage instead of student
actors. Aside from their authenr
ticity, the costumes were unusual-
ly beautiful. Their color Scheme
and their oi-nate trimming served
to accentuate the elaborate per
fcction shown in all aspects of the

. play.

Marjorie Childs, playing the part
0! the Image of the Holy virgin,
made an excellent performance.
Throughout the opening scenes of
the first act her part required herl
to remain immobile in order to
represent a statue. This she did
to such perfection that one was
apt to doubt one’s program notes
and believe that the figure really
was a statue. When she finally
came to life in the person of Sis-
ter Beatrice she played her part
well. The audience greatly on-
loyed her two vocal solos, one in
the first act and one in the sec-
ond.

The three “sweethearts" of the
play were the two Andrews boys,
Jack and David, and Nancy Ever-
ton, daughter of Dr. John Scott
Everton. Dean of Chapel. The
two boys were included in the
group of beggars who entered the
scene at the close of the first act
Although their parts were small
they were a part of the play the
audience remembered and made
favorable comments on after the
production Little Nancy D/ertori
as the sister of Little Alette
(played by Barbara Macoubreyl
was an adorable figure in her
tiny.robe. The audience was de-
lighted with the child's stage he
iavior, which was equal to that
of a “grown-up.”

The entrance of the beggars on
,the scene was an unforgettable
moment of the play. The almost
mad expressions on their faces
and the wild and greedy joy they
showed upon receiving the gifts
from the sister, was another ex~

 

presented a vivid picture of ex
treme poieity accompanied by utr
most gratitude for any small fave
or.

Maxine Hay is certainly to bc
congratulated for her perform
ance of Sister Beatrice, the ways
ward nun. She absolutely shone
during the closing scenes of the
play when Sister Beatrice was
supposed to be represented as

slowly but surely breathing herl

last. The scene was one of teusc
drama, and through the medium of
excellent acting, the audience felt
this Lensclless.

The compliments diic Mr. Air
drews are twofold First, for l
acting in the role or Prince Belli-
dor, the lover of Sister Beatrice
In this part he made a wonderful
dramatic appearance, The stu-
dents got quite a “kick” out oi
the love scenes considering the
fact thdt they were enacted by a
student and a professor, but they
willingly admitted that he played

1 the part well.

Mr, Andrews is also to be com.
plimented for the play as a whole.
It is thanlts to his able overa-ll
direction of
involved in production that the
play was so complete a success.

The production of Sister Beat-
rice will not soon be forgotten by
those who saw it.
