GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

OCTOBER 22, I943

 

“Count your profits and count your sheep
. . . Life is passing above your heads . . ,
Just turn over and try to sleep.”

Don‘t get serious about this thing.
That may lead to mol'bidness. We must.
be gay. We mustn’t let tlle war count tool
much. After all, we must keep this place'
just as it was when ‘they’ were here. Yes,
that’s it. ‘They‘ would want us to keep it
gay and careless and disaffected

Don’t think about the "tlley’s" who
won't come back. Don't think about silli-
plies that won‘t arrive or your respollsh
bility for them. Don’t think of “why's”
you may have to answer someday.

Just Try - -

There’s one nice\thing about spending a
war in mid—Iowa: the guns aren’t very
noisy. One can sleep without too much
trouble through the flights of bombers;
the torpedoes are polite. Of course the
fire drills here are bad. Disturbing, you
know, Unannounced and that sort of
thing. War activities are a bit thick; not l
enough time. And too bad your allowance
never quite coincides with the day stamps
and bonds are sold,

But we are made of stout stuff. Carry-
ing on through all sorts of difficulty.
Blood, sweat, tears, and mid-sems. Oh, it’s
tough!

Now obviously the contribution of col~
lege students to war is of a. nature sep
arate from that of fighters. We are the
thinkers‘save on Saturday mornings We
are ones to build that brave, new world.
No need to feel self-conscious. No need
for justification. No need for that little
thorn of guilt—deep, noiseless, self~made
and inescapable—which prickles our right:.
eousness.

Let our conscience not trouble us. Think
not of cold or deathﬁthey are unpleasant.
We are doing all that anyone who knows
us could expect. Don’t "lie in the dark and
listen" to those occasional bomber flights
which pass quickly, and with a pride we
do not know, over this campus. Do no think
of them on a mission more awesome; do
not let yourself picture their failure or sucr
cess, or your part in either of those out-
comes. After all, bombers which fly over
Grinnell are only on their way to Lincoln,

'one and should not be treated

 

N’ebr., and they are perfectly all right.

they don‘t go too damn patriotic on us.
Miglltrerven drop around. Think about it
tomorrow. But now fist turn over and
try to sleep.

Quie’r. Please - -

Shhh! ! People at work! You soldiers, new
students and old ones, the library is a
place where people like to have peace and
quiewyou can't sleep with somebody next
to you telling a joke and another group
across from you audibly speaking in a
foreign tongue. l
Seriously though, the situation in the‘
library has come to the point where some-
thing should be clone. This should apply
to the faculty as well, for our roving in-
vestigator has reported, and we can Verify
the report, that faculty members are as
guilty of the misdemeanor as any of they
students—Mr. Baumann and Mr. Woods
please note. ‘
The library in past years has been a;
sanctum sanctorum for students, but thee
student of 1943 must have marvelous pow-i
ers of concentration to accomplish any-‘,
thing there under the conditions whichj
now exist. If the situation gets too much!
out of hand there are always the librariansl
to enforce the quiet rules, but we are not
longer children and each person availing-l
himself of the facilities of the library‘
should take it upon himself to enforce the
rule as far as he himself is concerned.
Though the writer may seem a little
flippant at this point, the situation at!
the library is by no means a humorousi
as such,
It is our sincere hope that this noise hasl
been a careless oversight by the offenders
and that now the matter has been brought
to their attention the offenders will cease
to offend.
