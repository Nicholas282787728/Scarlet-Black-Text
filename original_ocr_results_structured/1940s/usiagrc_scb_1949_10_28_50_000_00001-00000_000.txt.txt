Thirty Years of Pioneers;

Name Chosen

By now, just about everyone

by Contest

knows that tomorrow is the dia-

mond jubilee of intercollegiate football West of the Mississippi
river.. But how many know that tomorrow wlll also mark the
30th year that Grlnnell athletic teams have been known as “Pm-

beers?"

It will be exactly 30 years ago tomorrow—October 29, 1519‘
that the Scarlet {it Black announced that Pioneers would be the

‘future name of Grinnell teams.

The namc was suggested by
Sol Gilberg, ’20. in a contest
conducted by the Honor G. For
his efiorts; Sol won a 1921
Cyclone,

Some 150 names were submitel
ted to the Honor G committeel
in charge of the contest. To quote
that issue of the s at a: l

”The fmal decision lay between
Trojans and Pioneers, the latter
being chosen because of its sig—
nificance in connection with the
history oi the college. Other pope
ular names were the Cardinals,
the Bear Cats, and the Cubs.

”The history oi Grinnell makes
‘The Pioneers' an especially ap-i
propriate name ior her atheltic‘
teams. In 1868, Grinnell played‘
Iowa State university in the first
baseball game to be staged on
Iowa soil. In 1889, when football
was inaugurated, the Scarlet
and Black team beat the State
University eleven by a score of
24 to 0.

"At the first statE‘ track meet
held in 1890, Crinnell was rune
nel'rup, In the words of a sports
writer for the New York Evan,
ing Post, She (Grinnell) was
playing basketball when the rest
of the state—aside from a few
YMCA teamsedid not know
whether the sport was a new}

 

sort of tatting or a variation of
crokmole. Grinnell also went in
for soccer when the Middle
West, or most of it, would have
regarded the name as suggesting
some new. wrinkle in breakfast
foods.”

"The well known story of the
Iowa Band who were the Pith
neel's in middle western educa»
tinn lends added historical back-
ground to .the name."

Homecoming, 1919, saw the
Purple team from Cornell ven—
ture to Grinnell. Highlights of
the weekend, for which some 100
alumni returned to campus, in—
cluded the football game, a
Dramatic club presentation, and
an “allecollcgc pep meeting and
l'ocrational hour in the Men’s
gymnasium“ (now the Wome
en’s Gym, to us),

‘Feature of the pep-meeting
was the introduction of a now
Grinnell football song, a parody
on Sousa's ‘U. S. Field Artillery
Mzil'ch.’ The men's glee club pre-
sented the song, and drilled the
students in its words and tune

That got your reporter’s inter-
est all fired up. and. browsing
around a little, we finally sues
ccedcd m tinchng the words to
that my light song, evidently
