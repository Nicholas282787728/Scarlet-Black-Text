The Second Freedom - -

.(t is with sincere regret that the students
and faculty of this college have learned of ‘
the resignation from the Iowa State College -
' faculty of Dri T. W. Schultz, widely known
professor of economics. ,
' That regret is not only at seeing ill this
resignation tlle breaking- up of a stellar
department of agricultural economics, but
15 even more directly concerned with the
cause of the resignation
1 Some time ago, the economics depart
ment of Iona State, under the direction
of Prof. Schulz, issued a bulletin based on
a comprehensive study of oleonlargarille as
a. substitute for butter. The report was
based upon facts~the better to frighten
the dairy interests of Iowa. Upon protest
from representatives of that industry, a
reissue of the pamphlet “as undertaken,
h an even more exhaustive collection
of facts The interests discovered they had
made a tempest out otwhat might quietly
have remained a teapot if thei' prejudice
had not attempted to stifle a sincere and
scholarly work.
' In the ensuing discussions between irate
dairy lobbyists alld the authoreeonomists,
lpport from the administrative officers

Yeffected those who

i the battle of butter, can hardly de disa5e

attempted to protect
business interests ill all academic questlon,i
or those over whom the mantle of academic

, leadership had been flungiapparently cai'e»‘
‘ lessly,

The announcement of Dr. Schulz’s res-i
ig'nation, coming so closely on the heels 0 i
sociated from that battle. It is apparentl
that Dri Schulz, as ally other teacher 0
integrity, finds his position ill a college
whose olllcers are unwilling to stand byl
the principles they glibly defend in empty
words, absolutely untenable. l

Furthermore, it is conceded that many,
of the other department member, who to»:
gether formed a world-center for the studyl
of agricultural economics, will follow Schulz
into more trustworthy academic climates
Not only has Iowa State, through its reed-1
like compliance to organized business in»
terests deprived itself of a fortune in ability‘
and brains, but it has deprived the entire;
country of the combination of those many;
talented persons, for it is extremely doubt-i
fill that any great per centage of them!
will be able. to gather in any one other’
school. fl

We think that Dr. Scllulz’s resignation,
which forecasts many more to come, gives

. the president of Iowa State college a great
deal to think about of a quiet evening,
.We hope he is extremely happy with his
thoughts of the dairy men, who may now
pay that portion of their taxes which is
granted to Iowa State with a greater slac-
‘-rity and a personal interest When the,
‘president finds it increasinglv difficult tol
‘ hire a new economics faculty of the caliber
‘of the old, the taxes may, perhaps, maliei
, up for medioclityi

It also gives us much to think about:

not only pleasure in realizing- that manyl

“ are the pitfalls a privatelyrendowed collegel
axoids; but also a real belief that the‘
realistic e ercise of theories of freedom
‘ would receive a more concrete support were
it'he situation a local one.
