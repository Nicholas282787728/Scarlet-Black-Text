HOW To WIN A BASKETBALL
GAME IN TEN Shooi DS: Grin-
ncll playing Carleton at North-
field, Minn, Friday night. The
Pioneers had been behind, 1143,
at halftime, but came back at
the beginning of the second peiu
iod to take a onerpoint lead.

They held this lead right up
to the closing seconds of the
game; TllENeatter playing keep-
away for over 60 seconds, the
Pioneers suddenly lost the ball
and four Carleton men went sail-
ing down the floor to make
a basket, putting the Car-ls in
the lead with loss than ten
seconds to go.

Edd Bowers took the ball out
underneath their basket and pas-
sed it the length of the floor to
Gene Peisner. Peisncl‘ shot from
the side, but missed. Zahuer,
who started running for the other
end when Bowers passed down
the floor. was under the bank»
board for the followeinrsliot, But
Stan's shot was bloclied. Threo
seconds left in the game.

Kendall drove in, took the ball
out of one of the Carletonians'
grasp, leaped up and dropped it
in the buclrct. The gun went off,
the game was over, and for the
second time in a week the Pio-
neers had won a game by one
point, 27 to 26.

Said Coach Ben Douglas after
the game, "Boy: I lit right in
the middle of the floor when
that gun went oif."

Said zahllor, “I had one more
run left in m' system. That
was it!"

said Kendall, “I never
thought it would happen to
me!”

Speaking of the Carleton
game, it seems worthwhile to
mention the fine quality of
sportsmanship displayed by
their students and players

After 21 hard scrimmage at
one end of the ﬂoor and one
team had come out on the
short end of the deal, there
were no hard feelings or
Sheers, iio boos, just the
friendly remarks between
two teams fighting hard to
win. I don‘t recall hearing
one boo during the game.
Quite a difference from the
atmosphere at our last home
game.
1» .,

Looking over the average per-
sonal fouls per game called on
the Pioneers so far this season,
we find that Co»c&ptain Jerry
Fort and Paul Patterson are the
ioughics of the Squad. Each of
them has averaged 2.5 fouls per
game. Carcaptain Peisner and
Harold Kendall are next in line
with an average of 1.8 fouls per
game. Zahller has an average of
only 1.5.
