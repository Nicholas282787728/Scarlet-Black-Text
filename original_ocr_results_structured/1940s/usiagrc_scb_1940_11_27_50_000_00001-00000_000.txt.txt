Faculi‘y Gran‘ls
Council Requesl
As Experimen‘l'

A resolution calling for open-
illg the library Sunday was
passed by the faculty at a
meeting Monday. Under the

Barber Destroys
Last Remnants

Of Ranch Days

By Clyde Bates

A period of destruction com-
parable to the cyclone which flat-
tened Grinnell in 1332 swept over
the campus last week-end,

The Great Shave began Satur—
day night after the Ranch Wran-
gle, and continued through Mon-
day, according to Avery Adkins,
local razor racketecr. Many of
die lesser beards, no doubt, were
erased in the privacy of dormitory
cells. But among those who re-
quired the skill of a professional
band were Tom Carmody, Carl
Blandin, Fred Webb, Clair Witney
and Ross Notaro.

Carmody and Notaro jumped the
gun, according to Adkins, and
were shorn Saturday night.
Carmody lacked the courage to go
the cutiie route and he com-
promised by leaving a. mustache,
Adkins Said,

Webb, Bladldin. and Whitney
were uncovered Sunday morning.
Webb, who won the beard contest
Saturday night, was the first in
the choir, and his whiskers justi-
tied the award in Adkin's cs —
motion. “Webb’s was the tough—
est and biggest heard I was ever
associated with," Adkins said.

Blandin was a runner»up to
Webb, Adkins thought, and Whit-
ney's beard was like slicing angel

, food cake after the Webb episode.

Mr. and Mrs. Gombosi Came to the U.S. for Siereeks
But Now Plan to Stay Because, They Like Country

By Barbara Brann.

Mrs. Annie Gombosi, instructor in
violin, came to the United States
from Switzerland in 1939 With the
intention of staying six weeks.
The six weeks have Stretched into
a year, and she is Still in this
country.

"Since we have been here this
long and are becoming attached to
this Country. we will probably not.
think or going back for some
time,” she asserted. BITS. Gom-
bosi and her husband who teaches
music at the Univer ty of Wash—
ington, came to this country to
attend the international Congress
of Musicology.

Her first and most vivid im~
pression was the fact that it was
possible to travel in any part of
the U. 5. without a passport and
that the same language is spoken
and understood in all sections.

“Al: home. I hovc to carry my
passport when 1 go on a hike,” She
explained, “because no matter in
what direction you go, thcre is a
borderline of snothcr country
close by.” For this reason, every-
one speaks at least three lang~
uages; Swiss, French, and Gemall_
All three are taught in grade
school and Latin and Italian are
required in high school, she said.

“Rocking chairs, suitcases, and

ice-cream were the things most
impressive to one of my friends
when he first come here, and they
impressed me too,” the violinist
admitted.

Over hot tea and cookies, Mrs.
Gombosi discussed the Swiss
broadcasting system. "It is not a
business,” she explained. J“It is
managed by the Swiss Post and
there are no. commercials or ad-
vertising of any kind.”

(Editors note: This is the first
of a series of two features about
Mr Combosi. The scoond, dis»
ons ug cilucatlon in Europe, will
appear in at future issue of the
Scarlet and Black.)

The college is giving out a
