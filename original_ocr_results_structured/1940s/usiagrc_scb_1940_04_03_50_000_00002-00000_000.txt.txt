A GLANCE FORWARD

With this issue, the Scarlet and Black, under
a new administration, embarks upon its
seventy-second year of publication.

What that year may hold in store for
this newspaper—whether or not it will wit-
ness a fruitful maintenance of the stard-
ards of the Scarlet and Black is not for us
to say. But one thing we can say:

Our every effort shall be directed to—
ward rendering the Scarlet and Black
worthy of the position it holds bothon and
off this campus, a position thoroughly in ac-
cordance with the finest tradition of Grin-
nell College. ‘

Undoubtedly, there will be occasions
when we shall fall short of that objective7
occasions when we shall be unjust in these
columns and times when we shall lay our~
selves open to severe criticism for the errors
we shall make.

In such cases, it is our hope that we
shall be among the first to recognize the
deficiency and, with the cooperation of the

A NEW ENTHUSIASM

The enthusiastic reception accorded our
new coach and his assistant ill chapel Mon»
day morning was, we hope, the sign of a
change in attitude by the student body to-
ward the athletic department.

Such a change is necessary if our col-
lege is to turn out winning teams in any
sport whatsoever. After all, the new coach
is faced with more than his fair share of
problems without his being expected to find
the remedy for an apathetic attitude of the
students toward athletics,

It is not fair, however, to blame the
students alone for their lack of interest in
the past. The team must perform creditably
to deserve student support. This _does not
mean that the students expect Grinnell to
win all of its games. No one in school ex»
pacts, for example, that the football team
will be undefeated next fall, but we all hope
that disasters like last fall‘s Carleton, Simp—
son and Beloit games will not be repeated,
Defeats of that sort would have taken the
heart out of the most loyal set of fans in
the country. The score lied when it in-
dicated that we won from Simpson.

The feeling displayed by the students
in Monday’s chapel is a healthy sign for
the college. Let us hope it was but the
first of such symptoms.

Paul mucud has concentrated
his efforts upon strengthening
the French economy in prepara-

Coming to the Finance depart.

in November, 1938, the diminu-

economy on the shakiest of pins
as c result of the expensw“ “re-
