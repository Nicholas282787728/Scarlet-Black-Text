Querying A Capitalist

The editorial ear is naturally a repository for many of
the choicest rumors on the campus. And in a way, this
function is one of the most fascinating angles of the editors
in] game. Students bustle into the office wearing rumpled
tweeds and a worried look in their eyes and hint at dark
doings within these ivyvcovered halls. We are called upon to
look into a situation, an office, a personality, and, dutifully,
we fold two or three sheets of clean copy paper into coat
pocket, sharpen a pencil, and start out in search of truth.

What seems to be one of the favorite earlyvin-the-year
yarns around the campus is the old story about the book—
store. The students are being gouged! The fat capitalists
are milking us dry because they know we have to buy books
from them! Did ya’ hear that the school made $15,000 off
books last year? Why don‘t we revolt and institute a stun
dent cooperative? How about giving us books at cost?

Never before having brushed up against any real
bloated capitalists, we were naturally delighted last week
when someone suggested an investigation of profiteerlng
in the bookstore. The specific charge leveled was that the
college bookstore was selling a particular text at something
like two dollars more than list price and other bookstores.

Seeking the proverbial brass tacks to which the editor~
ial mind is supposed to get down, we began our investiga»
tion armed with righteous indignation and a sterotype of a
bloated capitalist, a huge bulbous, cigar-smoking bully With
pointed teeth and thousands of little dollar Signs cleverly
woven into the fabric of his tailor-mades.

What we found was Mr. Samuel Wassom, manager of
the Grinnell bookstore, who, like most everybody else
around the campus who isn’t a student, is just another em-
ployee of the college. Surprisingly enough he didn‘t seem at
all upset when we boldly stated our reason for being there.
He did seem a little sad. .

”It‘s the same way around every college the first part
of the year,” he said philosophically. “I attended a clinic
this summer at the University of Chicago for bookstore
managers . . . we’ve all got the same problems." 'Mr. Was-
som, an unpretentious gentleman, not the _least,blt bulbous
and without a trace of a dollar sign on his blue shirt and
grey slacks, assured us that every text book in the store
was priced strictly by publisher’s list. “If anyone ”thinks i,
he’s been overcharged he should come in and see me, Wass
som said, “because it's purely accidental. You know how
it is around the first of the year.” We agreed that we
knew how it'was. “Well,” he went on, “with all the. stu—
dents milling around trying to get their books and With a
lot of new help . . . Well, mistakes are made. As a matter
of fact, we just about break even on the books. Where we
make any profit is on supplies . . . but even at that on a
lot of important items we’re underselling stores in Ames
and Iowa Cit ."

We werey on our way after thanking Mr. Wassom for
his cooperation when he said a little sadly, “A lot of peo-
ple think I own the bookstore. I don’t.”
