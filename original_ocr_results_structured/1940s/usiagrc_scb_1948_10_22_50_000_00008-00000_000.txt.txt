man participated in a variety of
sports. lettering in football, 17357
kctball, and track for two years,
and in golf for one year. He has:
also proved himself to be a do
cided asset to Pioneer sports, as
this 5 ft. 9 inch, ITDepoulld

athlete has lettered here in fools
hall and golf, and was the 1657
pound intramural wrestling champ
last year.

One of Jack's likeable charac—
teristics, his friendly smile, would
probably broaden even more if
he were fed his favorite meal;
spaghetti and meatballs with beer..

His choice for an ideal in femin->
inity seems to be a around
5 feet, 2% inches ‘\' .ghing. 110‘
pounds, brown curly hair With
brown eyes, and named Janet.

major, but is uncertain about his
future plans.

Audience Views

A highly pleased and enthusias-
tic audience witnessed the pl‘esenr
tation, last week, of the Russian
movie, “Stone Flower.” which was
the second in a series of foreign
films being presentcd at the Strand
theater.

The movie, based on a Ural
mountain folk tale, was filmed
with a new Coloring process, the
Russians claim to have developed,
and was startling in its beauty
and simplicity.

In Reirospecf

Homecoming week end seems a
good Unit to start many things,
and cspccially a column of this
natiirc. The old timers may like to
be reminded of what happened in
thcir days on this campus and we
who are here now will get aklck
out of hearing about old times,

The college paper back about
ten years ago, was a bi-iveckly
usually of four pages. onc of which
was devoted to the editorial. The
editorial in the 5 dc B of October
15, 1933 goes to great length to
praise the spirit that has been
shown at the football games, For»
haps the alumni will show us some
of that Spil‘ltvgoodness knows we
need it.

Prepsiyou never had it so
good: In 1938 a three day limit
was set on hell week, or Fresh—

,men improvement days as it was
called then; assignments were notl

to be given that would entail
traveling more than 20 miles from
the campus. Dutics included such
things as cleaning the main street
and local j 1.

An article in a dusty s & B says
that there are more pictures ileed~
ed for the annual which reminds
us that more subscriptions are
needed now in order that we have
a Cyclone at all.

A supervised dating bureau was
established on campus ten years
ago with the purpose of solving
the social problem. All students
left their names with the bureau
and the occasion of the date and
the requirements of the date, suchl
as intcrests, height, coloring, and-
personality. Arrangements were
made for the dates to meet at the
White House, but the match make
ers were not thc ones to do the
introducing In fact, the match
makers were not known to any
one but the bureau, to forstall the
possibility of murder no doubt.

It seems like the clocks in ARI-I
haven't been repaired in ten years.
.An old 5 5: B carrics the woeful
tale of senior girls missing- their
mouths With lipstick in the morn-
ing and combing their hair on the
run only to find when they arrive

lat their 8 o’clock-s, that they have

lots of time according to ARI-I
clocks,

Speaking of CST/(Crazy School
Time) here is a word of caution
to clock wetehcrs; Time will pass,
will you? .

Somewhat battered and blcal'y-‘

the s at B office on 3rd ARI-1,:
The f st light of dawn was Slith»

was a curse, but in his llappy‘
heart theic sang “Excelsmr!” He‘
had made the grade when the
test had been thrust upon him.
A week ago he ncvcr dreamed
that this grcat opportunity would
come tumbling into his lap, But
it had. Well he remembered that
happy moment,

Sweet Algernon had been qulei’ri

enthusiastically, “Algye, old bean,‘

to be out of town next week . i
big deal, you know . . . I've de-
, cided that you are the suck . . .

to step into my shoes and carry
on‘,” How furiously beat Alger»,
lion's pulse as the heady perfume.

and now so near fulfillment

When Aigle's day came ,after
seeing the editor off to his con-
venion or where ever it was that
he was going, he threw himself

pretty young copy editor from
Wiiat Chcei-i into the task of
putting out a paper, Did he sno-

Then quit your beefing, he made
it okay, didn’t he?

The team will be run under
single wing formation with
