Two Conference Games
Are Sei for Weekend:
Meei‘iKnox Salurddy

By Jack Wile.

Grinnell’s cdg ' will open
their season allay from home
Friday night iii :i tnilg‘le with
the Fighting Scots of Monmouth
college,

The foilowmg night, the Pio-
neers jiunp over to Galesburg,
111., to meet the Knox college
quintet Both of those opponents
are members of the Midwest con-
fei-cncc, making it necessary for
the Scarlet and Black to turn in
victories this weekend in order
to get a start toward the con-
ference championship.

' Last year, the Pioneers were
among the leaders of the league
up to the middle of the season
when they hit a five-game losing
streak that send them sliding
down to a final third place stand-
ing, Three other schools tied with
Griunell in the final r81111357
Monmouth, Carleton and Beloit.

Fort, Peisuer are co-captoins,

Co-captain Jci-ry Fol forward
for the Pioneers, will lead the
Pioneers scoring attack against
their opponents, Fort-s individual
scoring record of 144 points for
last year’s season was eclipsed
by former captain James Nash’s
record-breaking accumulation of

one of the outstanding scorers
in the conference.

Another Grinnell forward who
is proving in practice that he has
a good eye for the basket is
Paul Patterson, a fast junior
member of the sqaud,

Gene Peisner, the Pioneers' oth-
er co-captain. will probably start
Friday night's game at the cen-
ter position. Peisner, entering his
third year of varsity competition,
gives the squad a necessary con-
tribution of smooth, coordinated
bell-handling. He may have to
sharc his spot with Hugh Mc-
Cartney, a junior transfer from
Burlington Junior college.
Zohller, Kendall At Guard Posts,

At guard position for the Pio—
neers we should find another
letterman, stan Zahner, whose
shooting eye to his already out-
standing defcnsive work. Another
lettcrman who is likely to start
in a guard position is Harold
“Hap" Kendall, who seems able
to take care of more than his
share of guard-work.

Monmouth's main threat to
Grinncll’s chances of victory lies
in their ability to hit the basket
from all parts of the floor, The
Scots, in the past, have featured
one or two marksmen flanked by
a tight defense that is difficult
to “crack.”

Fencing ln’reresl

Interest in fencing has taken a
definite upturn this week, Richard
Lippincott, Smith sophomore,
announced last night. A dozen
men have indicated an interest in
taking it for gym credit, and the
college will probably buy part of
the equipment for the class.

Lippincott and his roommate,
John Metchif, also from Smith.
are experienced fencers and will
teach the class.
