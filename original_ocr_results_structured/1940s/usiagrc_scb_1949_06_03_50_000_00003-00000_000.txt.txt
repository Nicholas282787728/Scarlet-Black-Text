exchange program is: by getting
to know each other better as‘
students, we will increase our:
understanding- ot' each other and;
decrease the trlotion and iml~
niosity which still exists. The
program is deﬁnitely ii success.
It might attain it greater degree
or success, however, it the stu-
denls ot Grinncll made a greater
et't'ort to get to know the 8V7
change students as persons, and
notrmel'ely as representatives.

At the beginning ot the semes-
ter we commented on the ap-
pal‘cntrfl‘eindlincss which we
found among the students, That
iricndliness has persisted.

From our contacts with thel
students we feel that the situar
tion mentioned above is merely
a manifestation of the general.
apathy on the part of the stu-
dents. ,

We think that more students
should get to know the DP and
foreign students; that the stu-
dents and faculty might be more
concerned about lnter»relatlon-
ships.

Another thing we have 011‘
served here is complacency.
This is one of the resons why
American democracy is so im-
pexfecti ﬂ democracy is threat-
ened by isms irom without or
within, it is due largely to the
apathy and complacency of the
people.

An enlightened and alert stu-
dent dey will produce en»
lightened, alert, and courageous
leadership. We think Grinnell
students are not utiliring their
opportunities and potentialities
to the tullest extent. I

Getting an education is a tull'
time job. But social awareness
is iust as much a part of edu-
cation as-iormal classes, We
think, then, that the students
should become more interested
in the social and economic con»
ditions of all segments of the
population. They should be
come more interested in the so-l
eial and economic conditions ot
the world and the relationship
at this country to the rest of
the world.

These are generalities which
do not apply to all, Nor is it.
meant to inter that these con-
ditions are absent at Hampton.
They require nothing more than
alert and aggr ssive student
leadership, elflclent coordination
of student government, and ace
tive support of the student body.

Due, we think, to the absence
oi fraternities and sororities
at Griunell, there is a whole-
some all-eollege social atmos»,
