Reserves Show
Scoring Punch
In Parsons Game

Fresh from its 20 to 0 victory
over Parsons the Pionccr grid-
dcrs go back into conference
competition Saturday when they
meet Cornell at Mount Vernon.
In last night's scrimmage funds»
mentals were stressed, and coach
Ben Douglas pointed out the num-
erous errors that different play-
ers made in the Parsons game.

Once again the scarlet and
black clad griddcrs waited until
the second half before opening up
their scoring guns. During the
first half, the Parsons eleven
made five'flrst downs to Grim
nell’s three.

Sory slings Passes.

Harry Waters gained more ex-
perience from his play against
Parsons, and should see more ac-
tion this week, according to
Douglas: In the pass catching de-
pertinent, Lefty Soiy pulled down
two impossible ones—the only
ones thrown to him that night,
and the only kind ever thrown to
him.

One of the finest runners seen
this year in Pioneer uniform was
Jack McGranc who ran the Kelly
Green boys off their feet every
time he took the ball, Tiger Ham-
ann consistently boomed long
punts down- the field to push Par-
sons back.

Bredinius Injured

Only one Grinnell man was in-
jured, and Ed Nagel and Harold
Jekel, who were out last week,
will both be available against
Cornell.

Jack Bredimus cracked his nose
in two places when he blocked a
Parsons punt in the first quarter,
but he is out for practice this
Week. Tod Kennefick is still out
of uniform and probably won't
see action for at least another
week.

Town Men Plan
ln’rramural Talk

Intramural activities will he dis-
cussed and hail associations will
be revealed at the Town men's
meeting tonight at 9:30 in the as-
sociations building, according to
Duane Arnold, president of the

Attendance is compulsory. Re-
freshments will be served after
the meeting, he said.

In the absence of Thomas Car—
mody, the office of personnel
chairman will be filled temporari-
ly .

Ripun remains at the top of the
Midwest conference football race
as Monmouth lost to the Law-
rence Vikings last weekend, 22 to
s, althollgh.the Illinois eleven
made M first downs to Lawrence’s
9.

In games this weekend, Gr
hell is rated a slight favorite“
over the Cornell Purple. Accord-
ing to coach Ben Douglas, a team
traveling away from home to
play before a Homecoming crowd
leaves one and [IOSSIbly two
touchdowns,behind. However, the
Pioneers still rate an edge over
the Mt. Vernon eleven.

Lawrencenttnd Knox are given
a slight nod over coe and Beloit,
respectively, while the Ripon Red—
men are in for a tough struggle
with the Fighting Scots from
Monmoudi.

Gal-es Wins‘

Over Town

Champions Slay Al Top
Willi Clean Sla’re; Langan
Holds Second Posrlion

Led by the flashy running and
passing of freshman Ed Ahrens,
Gates hall Monday afternoon
romped over a badly confused and
outclassed Town Men’s touch foot-
hall team, 25 to 6.

Gates’ first touchdown came in
the early minutes of play when
Ahrens intercepted a pass and
ran 50 yards to pay dirt. The
Town Men struck back immed-
iately after the kickoff, and on
a brilliantly executed reverse
scored their lone touchdown.

From then on Gates had the
game under control. seeming to
score at will, the undefeated eight
marched up and down the field
to add touchdowns before the
closmg second when Carl George
intercepted a Town Men's pass
and crossed the goal line for
Gates’ fourth and last tally.
