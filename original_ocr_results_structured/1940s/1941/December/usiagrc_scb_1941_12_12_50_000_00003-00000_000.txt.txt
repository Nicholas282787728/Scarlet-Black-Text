thing I didn’t like was that the
professors didrrt clean up for the
next class. The 9 o‘clocks had to
trample in the mess.

Audrey Howard, iicml sopho-

but it could he worked. I wish
they had something else to drink
besides coffee.

It's a start towards o good idea,
hut it was poorly organized.

just as soon stay home and eat.

D. L. chnersteu, instructor in
