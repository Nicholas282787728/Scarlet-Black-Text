trying to arrange it so that Crin-

the games at home. There is a
possibility that Ripon college may
be able to come Nov. 3, but the
final word has not reached here
from Ripon. Duke said that the
Nov, 8 game was not likely to be

athletic committee has set Nov,

A 'confessioiial‘ then had the
accent on the ‘confess’ angle, and
that didn't imply a light brush-
over or the week's misdemeanors.

Female students of that rugged
era were required to meet each
week with tho lady-principal to
confess in minute detail any ma-
jor oi minor tleLoul' from the
path of virtue.
