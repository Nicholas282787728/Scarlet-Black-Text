C To the President—

(All editorial directed to Pres. Roosrcclt
from “The Dartmouth” of Dartmouth col-
lcgc, Hanover, N. H.) .

Editorial NotciThis is (m cditol'l'al of
vital importmlcc to you, a student at Git-71*
71ch college. Wk reprint it, not because we
heartily champion its contents, but because
it presents it brutally logical conclusion to
the course the United States has so for fol—
lowed. We advise you. to read it with utmost
consideration.

Sir:

Now we have waited long enough. We
have seen the Greeks go down and we have
heard the words of a Greek: "On October
28, Roosevelt pledged America’s complete aid
to Greece, but not a single cartridge has yet
arrived from the United States.” Greece
held on no longer, Like other modern small
countries, even one or two modern big coun—
tries, Greece found that brave men cannot
indefinitely fight airplanes with rifles.

Now we have waited long enough. We
hear that Greece has fallen and on the some
radio broadcast we hear that the United
States is sending Britain some ships—“small
ships, 20 torpedo boats." It is travesty in
the midst of tragedy We cannot laugh,
though; only shake our heads in dumb
amazement.

The Only Hope.

All over the world men are waiting for
you, In Greece, in Yugoslavia, in Norway,
in France, in Belgium, in Holland, in Poland,
you are the only hope of men who fought
and lost, In England, you are the only hope
of men who are still fighting. It must be
that in Germany itself there are men who
think of you as the only 'hope.

In American we too hope. We know that
your action is the only thing left that can
change the course of the world. Because we
know that although the soldiers of the Brit-
ish empire have fought longer and harder
and better than any other soldiers, they can-
not fight alone and poorly armed forever.

Now we have waited long enough. We
have seen the United States move slowly to,
l d war, through conscription, industrial
defense mobilization and the leaseAlentl act;
we have known that it moved too slowly.
Not Produced Enough.

We have not produced enough guns,
tanks, airplanes, bombs.

We have not supplied the ships to carry

what we have produced across the seas.

We havé not supplied the men to fight
the battle other men have been lighting for
us.

,. n

Now we ask you to order complete indus-
trial mobilization of this country on wartime
lines. We ask you to set in motion the ex—
ecutive alld legislative machinery which will
stop the farce of producing automobiles.
washing; machines, gaudy fashions, and
aluminum salad howls while the peaceful
world which is enhanced by these products
is being blasted to pieces.

Now we ask you to authorize the send-
ing of supplies across the seas in American
ships, oonvoyed by the American navy. Now
we ask you to send American pilots, lnechani
ics. sailors and soldiers to fight wherever
they are needed.

In the dark catalogue of our public events
no other answer can be given. The nol‘ld we
know is breaking up 'around us, and He try
to maintain business as usual, We do not
wish to die, so we seek reasons for avoiding
war Our logic compels us to the warlltc
answer; so we rat on our logic and turn off
our conviction of the Craven phrase “all
aid short of war.” In a world given over to
war and bound to be shaped and determined
by war, we strike for peace.

There Is No Peace. ,

We are not our best solves when we do
this. The loudest voices are those crying
peace, peace, \\ hen there is no peace. In the
Congress are men who through an honest
hatred of war, blind themselves to the con-
sequences of refusing to wage war when it
becomes Essential. Having waited long, sir,
we now ask you to overa'ide these voices;
to ove do the personal distaste for death
and armies held by every one of us; and
to make us our best selves by waging wal,

We cannot win without fighting. The

, people will not make up their minds that

this is war unless we fight it, We will never
win so long as we continue to lead strictly
private lives, so long as we go on getting 7
per cent profits, so long as we refuse to give
up an inch of ourselves to something bigger
than ourselves.

We can lose without fighting. If England
loses we stand alone. Ridden with internal
dissension, hanging each other for fifth col,
usnists, bearing the weight of a huge coll-
script army and a wartime economy, we will
see Germany rule the world; and we will out
of thatmess produce a native fascism and
all American Hitler We will lose the war
\l'lthout even figlltlng‘ it. Or if we do fight,
finally goaded to it and still strong enough
to field a unified army, we will fight alone,
in two oceans at the some time, against an
incomparably stronger aild more concen-
trated foe.

Victory If We Fight Now.

We can will if we fight now. We can
wake the sleepers in America. We can move
the self-hypnotics from the destruction they
seek before the wave of the future. We can
stop “business as usual” and work longer
and harder and for less money to produce
the things we need. We can send sllips to
England and to tho Mediterranean and to
the East Indies; we can build a hemisphere
strongly resistant; we can act now to save
the last best hope on earth a nation ever had
of staying- free and bringing freedom

Now, having waited long enough, we ask
you to help us’do this. We ask you to be,
lleve in us as much as we have believed lll
you. We ask you not to leave us stranded
like the Greeks.
