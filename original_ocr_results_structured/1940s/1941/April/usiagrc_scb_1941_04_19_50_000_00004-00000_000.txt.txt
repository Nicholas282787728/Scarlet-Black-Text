thirty—tno-mdn Iowa State
squad liext'\\’edliesclay. This
will be the first meet between
these two teams since 193‘.

In order to make the meet more
appealing to the spectators, Coach
Duke is scheduling the evenings
in a manner which has never been
tried before in track meets in the
mlddicswest. Duke is planning
to run the meet so that no two
events, with the exception of
the pole vault and high jump, will
be going on at the same time.
Puhlic Address System.

At most track meets. according
to Duke, there are so many events
going on at the same time that
it is hard for the spectator to
follow the activity, and he may
~lose interest. There will be a pub—
lic address system in use Wetl-
nesday. to aid the spectator

Iowa State will bring a formide
ablc array of distance runners to
the meet here. They have four
quartermilers who won the Big
Six indoor mile relay event this

tance runners are competing in
the Kansas Relays this weekend,
but the rest of the Cyclone Squad
is running in the Iowa State

In the history of Grinnell-Iowa

but every meet between the two

narrow margin.
