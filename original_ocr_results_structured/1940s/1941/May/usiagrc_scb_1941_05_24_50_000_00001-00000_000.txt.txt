Annual Hunt May Be Cancelled

To Cause Cancellation
Another False Alarm
Of Traditional Event

“Because of the difficulties aris—
ing from false alarms, it is un»
certain whether or not there will
be a 1941 Cyclone hunt,” Norma
Rose Myers, editor, stated to-
day. “If the bell is unofficially
tolled again, the administration
will not permit the staff to exe-
cute this year's hunt, and some
other means of distribution Will_
have to be devised,” she said
In the event that the hunt will
be held as scheduled, the bell will
ring after quadrangle closing
hours and all quadrangle doors

will be unlocked.

If the annual is found, the
finder may keep it after reporting
immediately to Miss Myers at the
Administration building. Whether
or not the annual is found, the
second bell will ring, and all girls
must return to the quadrangle,
Minutes will be taken ten minutes
after the bell has rung.

The Annual is sponsored by the
junior class, and is being present-
ed to the Class of 1941. other
information concerning the "1941
Cyclone" is to be withheld until
distribution. Those who have paid
for their annual will receive them
from a staff representative in
each cottage and hail after the

hunt.

Putty Nose Proves Dorcas
Pinkerton Is Not Miss Reed

Miss Theodosia Reed, eminent
authority on summer camp psy»
chology, and employment direce
tor of the Bide-aeWee Trout-
Trolling and Rest-Cure Rancho of
Saginaw, was a gniest of Grinnell
yestcrday afternoon and evening.

Bearing a striking resemblance
to Dorcas Pinkerton, campus
celebrity, Miss Reed was mistaken
for thc Crinnell senior several
times. until she withdrew before
dinner to return with more realis—
tic wrinkles and a slightly en~
lerged Roman nose.

Her entrance into the historic
quad dining room was vivid and
memorable. During dinner, maitre
d’hotel Jackson Trnesdale an-
nounced the hours of Miss Reed's
vocational conferences for this
afternoon.

Service was interrupted to prize
sent Miss Reed to the faculty wo-
men,

Miss Gardner stood up to honor
the distinguished guest, the Grin~
nell smile of cherry welcome

reaching out to the camp expert.
Miss Gardener shook hands with
Miss Reed. Miss Reed shook
hands with Miss Burtis.

Across Miss Reed's face odd
little crack‘s wended their way.
Not laugh wrinkles. Not worry
lines. They were ridged and a bit
shiny. There was a plastic mobil-
ity on Miss Reed’s face like that
of rather thickly applied grease
paint.

Miss Gardner chatted with her
guest. Miss Reed was getting
gooier. A light of recognition
spread across the dean’s face.
Dorcas went on talking, Dorcas
saw the recognition on Miss
Gardner's face.

Miss Reed held a brief interview
period in the drawing room fol<
lowing dinner. Due to circum-
stances beyond the control of
Crinnell college, however, Miss
Theodosia Reed of the Bid-a-
ch Troutmrolling and Rest»Cure
Rancho was not able to hold her
appointments for this afternoon,
