C A Good Time

Memories of Victory Day linger on. A bril-
liant fall day, gay—colored sweaters and
lumberjack shirts, laughing voices echoing
across the campus, the roar of rollerskates
rumbling in the gymiall jumbled into an
unforgettably good time.

The highlight of Victory Day was the
volleyball game between the faculty and the
Council of House Presidents.

First of all it was a thril lng game, ap-
proaching from the sportswriter’s view-
point. There was no lack of action or Skill,
With most of the action provided by the C.
of H. P. and most of the skill demonstrated
by the faculty.

But above and beyond this, the idea he-
hind the game was excellent, Students
were soon realizing that their professors
were human beings after all. Before long
the professors were vieing with their
younger opponents for the applause and
favor of the audience

For the atmosphere circulating around
student and teacher was free from restraint
and even downright cheerful.

We congratulate the Student Council and
C. of H. P. for sponsoring this event. We

0 Is It Trug

No other celebrity than Harlan Miller of
“Over the Coffee” fame has recently stated
in strong language that Iowa college stu-
dents are not at all interested in current
events. Enlarging on this statement, he
maintains that the adventures of Jane Ar-
den and football scores go to make up the
newspaper diet for the average college stu‘
dent. Can this be true‘.7

Unfortunately statistics supporting or
opposing tbs stand are not available In-
stead of attempting to defend ourselves,
we should like to ask Mr. Miller a few
pointed questions

First of all Mr. Miller, do you think it
possible for a man about to be shot at day-
break not to be concerned with the time of
night as he lives out his last few-hours‘.7
In like manner, do you think it likely that
students soon to be soldiers will ignore the
military foltunes of warring nations in
Europe and Asia? .

Again do you think it feasible that stu-
dents soon to be citizens will completely
overlook the coming of inflation and of an
incalculable national debt? 01' do you think
that young students intent on marriage and
their share of happiness will live in bliss-
ful ignorance of the danger signals that
crop up in each morning's newspaper

These are only a few questions that occur
to us. Perhaps Mr. Miller is right; we fer-
vently believe that he is wrong.

not, which occurs in a Red Cross
Tent City. The lighting by Hunt-
on D. Sellman was all essential
factor in the stage pictures.

A lcrgo cost handled the varied
cud difficult roles competently.
Outstanding were thc performance
by Bciborc Hudson cs Mom, .1
sympathetic portrayal of an old
or womnn by n young and com-
paratively inexperienced actress.
and tho pcrforrnoncos by Goorgc
Anderson and Rose Neil Reynolds
as the romantic leads. Notable
also was the playing of LeRoy
Morgan, who as Joey succeeded
in achieving much of the boyish-

, ncss of a twelveryealkold despite

the fact that, bclng s college
freshman, he was obviously too
big for the part.

Less successful wss the portrayv
al of lppy, the River-Man, by
William Porter. This character is
unquestionably the most difficult
part in the play, and it is to be
doubted that any amateur could
successfully overcome the difficulr
tics that prescnm, Yet the role
of Ippy, the symbol of the River,
needs to be expertly handled, for
upon its successful portrayal the
unity and the continuity of the
play are largely dependent. It
is therefore doubly unfortunctc
that the actor o‘f this part fell
below the author's intention De-
spite his obvious sympathy with
the poetry of his lines, William
Porter did not have the profes-
sionclly trained vcicc necessary to
keep his speeches from becoming
monotonous, and he lacked coma
pictcly the almost maniacal ex-
citation that alone could make
Ippy is vital, dramatic figure and
not merely a mouthpiece for vein
sificd philosophy.

In "Mississippi” Mrs. Pryor
proves herself awriter with akeen
sense of the theatre, with an un-
usual awareness of What consti-
tutes the dramatic and even the
melodramaticia rare and import-
ant ingredient of the playwright.
Such scenes as the rescue from
the loft held the audience breath-
less. ): at times the separate drc-
mstic incidents seemed to be in-
sufficiently ticd together, that imr
pression can be attributed in large
port to the inadequacy of Ippy’s
performance.

Certainly last night's production
was a personal triumph for Mrs.
Pryor, and thus also a triumph
for the cause of the drama in
the Middle West and at Grinnell
College.
