Benny’s Fedora
Rests on Game

If Grinnell eager-s can cut down
Cue here tonight as young George
Washington hacked down the
cherry tree over two hundred
years ago, mentor Ben Douglas
will sport a new fedora on the re-
mainder of the basketball trips
this year.

C. Lester Duke, in partnership
with Stanley Preston, local cloth»
ing merchant, has offered to pur-
chase a Stetson hat for the Pio-
neercoach,lf the Douglas-tutored
squad can overcome the Kohawks.

Douglas, who has never owned
a hat to the knowledge of anyone
at Grinnell, has promised to break
a personal habit of long stand.
ing, if his team comes out on the
long end of tonight's scoring. He'
will then join Lhe ranks of the
hat-wearing millions, and Duke,
along with Preston. will furnish
the headgear.

Taking a cue from the mum
of his country, Douglas admitted
that. he had many doubts as to the
outcome of tonight's game, p ‘-
marily because of Jerry Fort's
jured ankle.

And Douglas was not speaking
through his problematical Stetson,
or anyone else's hat, when he
pointed out that Fol-L at guard
would be an important cog in
stopping Coe's firewagon court
dynamite.

Grades 0’? Grinnell Men 60 Higher’

By Clyde Bales.

Holy writ dryly remarks that
men shall grow wiser and wealt-
er, and the men or Crinnell ap-
pear to have jumped on the hand-
‘Wagon with the rest of the World
in an effort to make this prophecy
come to life.

In the past five years, during
which time Grinnell athletics
temporarily hit the skids like a
Brahmin bull on a louse—dip
chute. hall grade-point averages
have taken a definite jump to
higher ground.

Records for the
1937 through 1941 show that
Dibble's average for the past
Semester of 2102 is the highest
during that period.

In 1940 the high average was
2.022; in 1939 it was 2.072; in
1933, 1.95; and in 1937 the high»

years from

--—As Alhlefics Skid

average was 1.50, These figures
show a definite increase per year
in the scholastic league comphﬁr
sons.

During this period Rawson ball
hns been in the forefront in the
scholastic ratlngs. In 1937, and
again in 1939, Rawsou was high
among the halls. In 1940 Rawson
scored second, and in 1933 the
hall was placed third. the Same
position which they landed this
semester.

Smith hell has also been con-
sistent in grade-point average
rankings. In 1938 and 1940 Smith
was at the bottom or the heap,
and in 1939, and this year, Lhey
wound up on the sccond peg from
the floor. In 1937 Smith had a
comparatively brilliant season,
winding up third in a photo tinish
with Gates.

The Kohawks, who finished Sec-
ond behind Ripon in the confer-
ence last year, are the highest
scorers in the loop and will offer
the Pioneers the toughest opposi-
tion that they have had this year
ﬁba rnone. Both teams have two
Conference games on their sched—
ule this season.

Coe rlays Carleton.

Cce has won 9 out of the 10
games they have played, Grinnell
has won 3 out of 9 games played.
Following tonight's game, Coe's
only remaining game will be with
Carleton. ‘

The Pioneers will end their sea-
son when they take the road to
Wisconsin for games with Law-
rence and Ripon, followed by a
post—season clash with Loyola U.
at Chicago.

Teams Split Last Year.

Crinnell and Coe split in last
years games. The Pioneers win
came during Chn'stmas vacation
when they downed the Kohawhs
at Cedar Rapids. 47 to 35. Coe
returned the loss to Crinnell in
the latter half of the season by
handing the Scarlet and Black a
42-37 detest, thereby pushing
them out of the conference race,
