Al Homecoming 20 Years Ago—

Snow and Freezing Temperal’ure
—As Grinnell Beal‘ Cornell I3-0

By Allell Al'liey.

Show was on the ground and the
thermometer was hovering around
the freezing mark when the
Griiiiiell Pioneers tackled the Core
nell gridders on homecoming day
20 years ago. ,

The first half went by without
a score from either team. Grin-
ziell spent the half in their op-
ponent's territory but couldn’t
score, despite the running and the
line plunges of Captain Mal-kley,
fullback, .

Stage Snake Dance.

At the half the scone was 070,
but the Grinnellians Weren’t dis—
couraged. They were full of pep
and endiusiasm. During the half
of the game a big snake dance
headed by Pat Moran's “Howling
Injuns" was staged out on the
field.

Coming back on the field for
Lhe second half the team was de-
termined to score. They had been
on the offense up to that time and
were going to stay that way.
Pioneers Scorer

During the last few minutes of
the third 'quarter, Captain Marlo
ley went over for a touchdown,

The score stood at 6-0 in favor
of the Pioneers, and nothing was
going to stop them then.

Score Repeater.

In the fourth quarter Markley
again scored and Gamer, left end,
kicked for the extra paint, make
ing the scope Grinnell 13, Cornell
D.

Cornell was lost. Trying every
thing, she couldn't get close to the

goal line. Thc ending second of
the game found the ball in the
hands of the Crinnellinns on Car-
nell's aseyai-d line.

Cornell had had only one chance
to score. Once she had comc
within 30 yards of the goal line,
rind tried a field goal, which fell
short.

This one chance was all the
hospitality the Pioneers gave the
Cornell gridders when they
played Crinnell 20 years ago, on
November 11, 1921.

To Judge Quad,

Hall Decora’rions

T'iie student Council has taken

Kent Hampton, president, anr
nounced today.

He added that the special pro—
gram to be put on between halves

given to the hall and to the cot-
tage with the most novel Home-

l2% oi: CAA
Siuden‘l’s Fail
Physical Tesi

Twelve percent of the {3]}
pliczln’ts fol“ CAA pilot tl'aliie
illg' fall to pass the entrance

physical examinations, ac-
cording to officials of the Civil

Aeronautics Administration.

Mr. Whitney, supervisor of the
3rd district, which includes Griiie
nell college, has named three
principle reasons for failure to
pass these examinations and re-
vealed that the number of rejece
tions could be reduced if appli-
cants appeared in a more rested
physical condition and a different
frame of mind,

The tendency of a boy who
wants to fly to crowd his school
life with too much outside activ—
ity is the first of Mr. Whitney's
reasons, He believes that the body
and mind of a boy who goes out
for athletics, glee club and a CAA
pilot training course cannot stand
the strain.

Many boys possess a psychologie
cal complex toward the medical
examiner, and this, coupled with
their physical condition as a re-
sult of hard study and athletics,
may bring about physical de-
ficiencies.

The supervisor’s third belief is
that a combination of conditions
particular to the individual pre-
vents acceptance in many cases.

He is of the impression that
these factors are avoidable and
advises that students rest and re-
lax thoroughly before applying for
physical examination.
