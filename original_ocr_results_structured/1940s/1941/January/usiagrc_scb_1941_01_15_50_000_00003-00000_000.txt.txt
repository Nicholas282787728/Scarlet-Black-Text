Morldr Board. Facul’ry

Following A two hour discus-
sion in the little dining-room
01' the men’s dormitories, the
Student Council, campus gov-
erning body, lflst night decid-
ed to reopen the cribbing
question.

To Write to Faculty.

According to Robert C. Young.
president of the group. it was
voted that the matter would be
discussed with members of ' the
Friars. senior men's honor socic»
ty, and with members of the
Mortar Board, senior women's
honor society. The Council also
decided to write a lettcr to the
faculty. asking their cooperation
in being more strict with crib-
hers.

A plan. whereby the names of
all faculty members who con-
ducted e: initiations in which
Cheating was prevalent. would be
piintcd in the Scarlet and Black
was voted down. six to one. by
the council. It was the opinion of
the majority of the council that
the mst effectivc way to prevent
cheating would be to have the
students cooperate with the fac-
ulty iii tiying to stop cheating.
rather than leave the matter up
to the faculty alone.

Student Court Plani

Another plan calling for a
court. at which students suspect-
ed of cribbing during examina-
tions, would be put on trial. was
suggested. This idea was voted
down as being too impractical.

Finally it was decided by the
group to talk the matter over
with Friars and Mortar Board be-
fore coming to any definite Coir
olusions.

Four—day Session

Ben Douglas, Pioneer basket»

resented Gl‘innell during
Christmas vacation at the
35th annual. convention of
the National Collegiate Ath-
letic association in New York
city.

College sports directors and
coaches from all over the country
assembled at Hotel New Yorker
on Dec. 28 for a four»day ses-
sion. Besides the members of the
association. meetings were held
by other organizations identified
With athletic activities in ullh

said that he attended meetings

Football Deaths.

Coach Douglas said that the
main subjects of the other meet-
ings dwelt on football. A report
given by Dr. Mal stcvcns. N. Y.
U. coach. and Profess Floyd
Eastwood of Purdue listed only
eight football deaths in 1940. of
these, one was in college competi-
tion. fivc were in high school. one
in “athletic club and fraternity"
games and one in thc so—called
“sandlot” games.

This report shows that acci-
dents on the gl'i’on are dce
creasing as the years pass. In
1939 there were 12 fatalities at~
tributed to football. in 1938 there
were is. and in 1937 there were
about 23 deaths resulting from
football injuries, Three reasons
were advanced for this decrease:
one, better equipment is being
used; two. football is becoming
a more open game; and three,
players are being subjected to
better conditioning than they have
had in the past.

Football Rule changes.

Rule changes approved by the
convention include a new rule
permitting the ball to be. handed
forward at any point behind the
line of scrimmage. Another new
statute now in effect declares
that a fourth down pass dropping
uncaught in the end zone is no
longer ruled a touchback. The
opposing team. however, must now

take over at the point where the
attacking team put the ball in
play on the fourth down instead
of on the 20 yard line as has
been ruled in the past.

Several results of this last
change were anticipated. includ-
ing higher scoring because of the
increased freedom given the at-
tacking team. deliberate safeties
taken by teams receiving the ball
on downs with their backs to the
goalposts. and the chance for a
team that has had its drive
stopped close to the goal line to
repeat its drive when the defend-
ing team is forced to kick.

w. E. Owens. last year's presi-
dent of the association, created a
purpose for all athletic groups
when he said. “We should do all
possible to expand our competi-
tive sports programs, intramural
and intercollegiate. to the end
that as many as possible may
participate and benefit."
