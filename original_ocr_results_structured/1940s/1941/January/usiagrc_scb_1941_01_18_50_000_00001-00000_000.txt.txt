New Haines Housemother Tells of Experiences in Army

Miss l-lulcl'lin Was
Once Army Hostess
During World War

“Every Saturday morning 1 watch—
ed the review of the troops, and
I wouldn’t have missed that tlirilt
ing sight for anything even
though I did swallow dos At
one time I saw General Pershing,
and another time General Foch."

Thus Miss Mary Hutchin, ncw
houseniother at Haines cottage,
summed up her experiences as an

army hostess at camp Meade,
Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland,
from 1919 to 1925.

“There was something doing
Continuously," she continued. “If
1 wasn't scciiig to it that the
wives, mothers, sweethearts, and
friends of the enlisted soldiers
were taken care of, I was helping
to cheperone one of the three or
four dances that were held each
week.”

Miss Hutchiir said that at one
time, counting the R. o. T. c. and
the c. M. T c. units, there were

14,000 men in thc army encamp-
lllent, “There was never a dull
moment," she added, "and how
those soldiers liked to sing!”

From her work in thc Council
of Defense, Miss Hutchill went to
Camp Mcndc as an army hostess.
“I enjoyed working and being
with those enlisted men," slic said.
“They were gentlemen, and so ape
precintive of what was being done
for them.”

Miss l-luchin also did social sci-—
vice work among the enlisted
men’s families

Surprise Duet

Features Singer,
Train Whistle

Concert goers were both surprised
and delighted Thursday evening
when they were presented with an
impromptu duet by Miss Lela Mae
Flynn and the Doodle bug whistle.

Flagstad and Melchior couldn‘t
have done better during a pas-
sionztte love scene from Wagner,
Miss Flynn held a high note, so
did the Doodle bug. The Doodle
hug whistlcd at the crossing; Miss
Flynn sang the variations.

The feature attraction of the
evening. however, was the pedal
leg of the piano which. midway in
the program, expelled a dying
gasp of torment and collapsed.

Opinion on the subject is divid-
ed into two schools. Those who
assert that the capitiilation was
due to the vim, vigor. and vitality
of the accompanist, and these who
insist that the individual pre sure
exerted by the artist during
moments of great emotional stress
in the rendition of their vocal orar
tioiis was enough to cause strong-
er things than pianos to turn in
their union cards and go back to
the farm

Talk in Chapel Seen As Inspiration
To Those Who Ain’t Got a Prayer

liy in Smith.
“And Judas went and hanged
himself. Go and do then likewise,”

This, along with other coni-
ments, makes up part of the
campus conversation resulting
from a chapel talk Wednesday by
Pres. Samuel N. Stevens on study-
ing for exams during reading pe-
riod.

The president in his talk sug-
gested a ten minute relaxation
period of Bible reading after fifty
minutes of studying, thus alter-
nating for a period of three hours
with a short rest at the end of
the period.

Several possib itics were sugr
gested. One co-ed mentioned that
each student might run up and
down the loggia with the Bible
clutched in one hand. actually

trying the experiment to see if it
works. This plan has the adille
tional benefit of providing the
hard-working scholar with a quick
fresh-air lift.

A more serious student stated:
“It would take me 20 minutes to
got back into what 1 was study-
ing after reading the Bible."

This idea, the president feels, is
a good one and may work out well
for the students. At least for
some of those who are in the
lower digits of the academic
scale, any connection which they
might establish with the Higher
Power: would pay dividends.

And even the professors them-
selves may do well to read one
quotation before exams such as:
“Blessed are the merciful: for
they shall obtain mercy."

drastic modification, in this,
their first year of application
at Gl'lllnell.

Such was the result of a meet—

Thursday afternoon in the Little
Theatre at the Quadrangle.

It was also tentatively decided
at the mccting to conduct a “Job
Hunt” in conjunction with the Job

students planning to go on the
Job Survey turn in their ap-
plications at once.

cial verification of this plan will
come after results of questionnaires
being sent to seniors have been
studied.

The Job Hunts, if held, would
be for the express purpose of find-
ing employment for seniors. while
the Job Surveys would be for un»

The decisions came in the riiidst
of an hour long scs, on, attendcd

The Grinncll president said that
in the past, senior-s had gone on
Job Surveys for the express pur-
pose of finding employment. When
cinploycrs learned students were
seeking jobs, instead of trying to
better fit college courses to busi-
ness carecrs, Grinnell college was
often the worse off in relation»

sorted.

“Job Hunt” Planned

“I’m perfect willing to throw
out these seminars anil‘llot have
them at it‘ll," Dr. Stevens stated.
“If you prefer to have a job hunt.
we’ll establish contacts With five,
perhaps six firms, which appear
to best fit your personal employ-
ment wants. If you want to take
chances on a job hunt in prefer-
ence to these seminars, I’ll go
through with it for you."
