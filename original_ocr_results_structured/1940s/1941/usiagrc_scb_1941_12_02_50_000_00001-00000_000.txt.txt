“the best possible presentation of
the wrong point of View.”

Speaking on “Education for
Democracy," Dr. Alexander will
defend her view that America’s
sarety in the future depends on
the return to America's ideas of
the past. Her conception of propr

vocates capitalism rather than

Schedule Meeting
in Near Future
To End Difficul’ry

The shies are clouding again for
the props as James Chaffee, pres-
ident of the prop class was noti-
fied yesterday that E. E. Spen-
cer, Newton contractor, is now
demanding 525.50 for the lumber
taltcn by the freshman class from
his property last September.

The offer came as a surprise to
Cliaffee who had bccn expecting
Spencer to bring suit almost im-
mediately. After having been told
by Charles P. Vogel that it
would be practically impossible
for Spencer to sue successfully
Chaffce now again fears the
freshman pocket book will be
drained,

The Newton contractor had in-
dicated in his last meeting with
Cliaffee that he would not ac-
cept anything lower than $55 as
settlement.

“1 can‘t offer more
th'ln $25,” Cllaffee told
him.

Chaffee was to meet Spencer
yesterday afternoon to settle the
matter once and for all, but due
to a misunderstanding Spencer
did not arrive at the specified
time. Chaffce is to meet Spencer
in the next few days.

An attempt by Pearce to re—
sign the position as president of
Clark hall was rejected by the
dormitory residents who gave him
a so to 6 vote of confidence.
Action Postponed,

Pearce had tendered his resig—
nation as president of Clark last
Frlday night, but action at that
time was postponed until the
Sunday night, enabling hall meni-
bers to consider candidates to
succeed him.

lot and Black was reinstated by
the committee last Week after his

grades had been
seen insufficient for eligibility in
student activities.

semester brought frowns from
committee members.
