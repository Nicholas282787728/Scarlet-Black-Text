its 47th annual spring concert in

lighted by scvcrai solo niiiubci-s,

Robert Page presented two solo
numbers during thc second section
of the program. and Gerald Van-
dcnbui-g stole the show with his
section of the repertoire.

He also soloed in spots of num-
bers sung by the whclc club and
was called back for an encore
after singing “When I Have Sung
My Songs." and uTramp, Tramp,
Tramp."

He chose “By the Fire" for this
extra selection.

The audience warmed up as the
concert progressed, and by the
time the end was in sight,
thoroughly applauded the number
“Grandma Grunts." This was so
wcll likcd that the group was
forced to sing it twice to please
thc listcnci-s,

As usual, the last selection was
the “Alumni Song." and aided by
former glcc club members in the
audience, the regular singers song
this in an excellent fashion.

In general. the whole concert
consisted of a very good group
0[ songs that were understandable
and thus wellraccepted by the
audience, and if this can be taken
