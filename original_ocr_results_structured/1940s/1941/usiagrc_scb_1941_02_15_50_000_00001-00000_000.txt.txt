Fort Finds
Free Flash

For Feature

When God said, "Let there be
light," he probably didn't have
Jerry Fort -in mind, but the Nae
tional Carbon company took a
different slant on the question
when they sent him a three-cell
flashlight loaded with “Ever-
ready" batteries.

Fort had mailed the ”Ever
ready" company a feature article
concerning a skating experience
of his father in Sioux Falls, S.
D., during which a companion
was saved from death by the
"trusty Everready flash.” The are
tiric was written last semester in
Herschel M, Colbert’s feature
wilting class

The letter which Fort received
from Allen Cleaton of the Ever.
rcady company read, “Thank you
for the letter telling how the light
of a flashlight loaded with ‘iEver-
readyi batteries mad it possible
to rescue your fatheis company
ion from drowning while on a
skating party. We are sending a
copy or your letter to our adver-
tising agency in New York with
the request that they consider it
for use in our ‘Everready' flash-
light battery advertising.

"As a token of our
LLm of your interest . . . . we
are sending you . . . . a three-
ccll 'Everready' flashlight,"
