enthusiasm in support of the
dances, the quality of music and
other features of the dances will
have to he cut so that we may
stay within our budget."

The present response to ticket
sales, the director said, indicates
that for the eight dances to be
staged this semester, only 40
dollars will be available for each
band. During the first semester,
the Club spent an average of 70
dollars for the orchestras.

“Throughout the first semes—
ter,“ Miles said, “Every effort
was made to secure the best
music possible.” He pointed out
that decorations, programs, and
other items had been sacrificed

to increase the orchestra funds.

A survey conducted last night
by the Scarlet and Black shows
that students approved the vars.
ity dances held last semester, and
that they would not like to have
the quality of the music cheapen-
ed.

Nor do the students want to see
the present Varsity program dis»
continued. Seventy—three percent
of those polled desired to have
them conducted as they are at
present, and nobody indicated any
desire to discontinue the dances.
However, 23 per cent stated that

Council Names Committees
Elections, Cribbing

To Study

Bert Anderson
Appointed Head
Of Poll Group

Bert Anderson, Student
Council representative from
Rauson hall, was named last
night by Robert C Young,
president of the gl'up, to
head a committee of ﬁve per-
sons to present to the Colin-
cil a plan to revise the elec-
tion of the Student Council
president.

Committee Members Named.

Other members of the comnllb
too, as clioscn by Anderson, arc
Ken Mathews, representative from
clark; Ray Nelson, Smith; Jean
Heinseii, Cleveland: and Mil am
Johnson, sophomore representativc
on the Couucil.

Probable action that will result
from the committee's meetings
will be a central polling place
for all students when voting in
Student Council elections, and a
political convention to select can-
didates for the presidency of the
Council.

Convention Suggested.

Among the plans suggested to
revise the methods of selection
of candidates was one to con-
duct an hour long chapel program
at which nominations could be
made from the floor. Another
idea called for a convention, to
be held on a Saturday moi -
ing, to which each hall and cat-
tage would send ten delegates.
Both these plans, and several
others, were left with the com-
mittee.

Under the existing system of
electing student Council presi-
dents, three elections are held.
The first serves to make nomina-
tions, the second selecLs the three
major candidates, and the final
election chooses the presidents.

Proctor Probe

Student Council Never
Passed Policing Plans,
Young Tells Assembly

Meeting for the first time
under a revised constitution
the new and enlarged Stu-
dent Council, by a 17 to 5
vote, tabled a proposed reso-
lution to condemn the proc-
toring system, which was pul
into effect during the recent
examination period.

At the same time, Ray Nel-
son, Smith hall representative
was named chairman of a cum
mittee to study the cribbing prob-
lem and attempt to reach a
practical solution to it.

Proctors Never Approved.

It was learned during the
course of the discussion that the
Student Council had never for-
mally passed the proctoring
system; that the proctors were
paid forty cents an hour, half
of which was to be paid by the
student Council; and that the
Council had never approved this
method of payment.

The resolution to condemn the
proctoring system came as a re~
sult of statements made by the
representatives of three men’s
halls and one women’s cottage
to the effect that the policing
system used during examination
was unsatisfactory to the rests
dents of those dormitories.
Halls Oppose Plan.

Nelson claimed that only two
Smith men were in favor of the
plan; William c. Harris. repre-
senting Gates, presented a peti-
tion signed by 35 Gates men
against the proctoring system:
Ken Mathews of Clark stated
that a vote taken by the hall
