‘Collegiana’ Found Well-Handled Despite Poor Stage Setting of Chapel

Lack of Curtains,
Inadeqmate Lighting
Hampers Production

By William Buckley

Grinneli college students, demon-
strating their typical iackadaisical

attitude. missed out on one of
the better functions of the year
when they failed to turn out en
masse to witness “Collegiana”
which was presented last night in
Herrick chapel before a not-so
capacity audience.

Taking everything into
sideration, the performers

con-
were

handicapped by cramped stage
facilities, inadequate lighting, and
a complete lack of curtains. Des-
pite these deficiencies, however,
a satisfactory show was staged.
Vagnci- Praised.

A paragraph should be turned
over to Robert Vagncr, director
of the band, before this review

gets out of hand, to congratulate
him on the great strides that
this organization has made under
his leadership. Working with a
large and unwieldy group» that
lacks the tradition of the glee

A5 Pele Inglis Watches Bus Leave—

Chicago Wilnesses Melodrama
—And Rock Island Profils on Deal!

By Catherine Funk

Pete lngiis used to be like you.
But not now. Now he knows.
Travel is broadening.

The “Collegiana” performance
in Chicago Monday was a wonder
iul thing. Good, clean-cut. Amer-
ican.

But Tuesday morning, on the
streets of Chicago, a mightier
drama was unfolded, stark pathos.

The Hero left the hotel. He
checked over his luggage. Even
his toothbrush. A seasoned travel-
ler, this. His companions are
late. Poor, unorganized souls.

He waited, Sun doesn't rise over
the skyscrapers very early, Still
dark and confused.

He walled. It was still dark. He

was getting confused.
He saw some buses leaving a

block away, Almost like Grin-
neli buses, he would have said.
only he knew better. Almost like
them. He waited.
He was young,
growing older.
There are nice, kindly, philan-
thropic organizations in big
cities. Someone came along.
Peter came home on the
Rocket last night. it as an ex—
citing trip to make all alone. He
knows a lot about big cities now.
He knows there are two doors in
big hotels. He is a seasoned
traveller.
The conductor put him off at
Grinneil.
