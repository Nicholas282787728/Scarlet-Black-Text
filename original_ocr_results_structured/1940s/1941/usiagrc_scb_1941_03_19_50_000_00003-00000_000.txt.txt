Hampton Makes Statement,

Hampton, in a statement to the
Scarlet and Black said, “I wish to
thank all you students who ex-
pressed your confidence in me,
and I’ll do everything in my
power to retain this confidence.”

“Its been a great fight, a lot
of fun, and no harm done," were
the sentiments expressed by

my support and cooperation," he
asserted.

Ray Nelson, Smith hall,

would have made a good presi-
