C (ZOE COACH 0

Tomorrow a Pioneer football
team which has been un—
defeated on its home field
since the Washbuln game
last year, takes the field against
a tough ooe aggregation.

The Kohawks' record is a de-
ceiving one, for they have play-
ed much better ball than their
record indicates, according to
coach Ben Douglas.

Dunng the past decade the
Coe-Grinnell game has developed
into a duel second only to the
Drake-Grinnell game. The Pie.
neers have won the last two in
the series.

Final Home Game.

This will be the final home

game for ten Grinnell seniors.

Those who will play
for the home crowd for
the last time tomorrow
include: Captain Louis
Gonins, Ray Mathews,
Art Wel'lein, Jerry Grant,
Hugh McCartney, Don
Hock, Don Hippie, Clint
Taylor, John Law, and
Bob Hamann.

The Kohawks have won two
and lost four conference games
and are in sixth place in the
Midwest conference standings.
They lost a non-conference game
to Carleton 6 to 0. Last week
they lost to the Siwash of Knox
whom the Pioneers defeated
earlier in the season.

Moss Handicapped.

By virtue of perionnanoes
throughout the year Chuck
Jess, a guard, has been the out-
standing Coe lineman. In the
backfield Devvayne VanDeclen
and Vic .Lowman have looked
best. VanDeelen is a sophomore.

Hank Moss, the basketball cen-
ter who plays quarterback, has
been great on defense because
of his punting. Moss, however,
has been handicapped by injuries
at good part of the season.
Mathews Sidelined.

Despite the tough practices
this week, Pioneer gn'dders have
come through in good condition.
Only Ray Mathews, who was
hurt in the Beloit game, has been
sidelined and he will probably see
some action, Douglas said,

Grinnell's probable starting
lineup follows: ends, Tod Kenne-
flak and McCartney; tackles,
Grant and Curly Bishop; guards,
Gonias and Taylor; center, Wer—
1ein; backs, Virgil Rees, lack
McGrane, Eli Nagel, and Augie
Gruening'.
