0 Election Politics

Amid the exciting if not hectic happenings
on the campus this past week, a new sys—

osity aroused over any plan adopted unani—
mously by the Student Council, it is well
to scrutinize the system by which the next
Student Council president will be chosen.

Certain improvements over the former
system are obvious. The establishment of a
central polling place will tend to eliminate
the undemocratic practice so much in evi-
dence in past years of halls voting as a unit.
No longer will a particularly gifted hall
president or house chairman be able to sway
his or her constituents by appeals to hall
loyalty. Only those interested in the elec-
tioll will vote. Not only will more votes be
genuine this year, but the possibill
the votes cast will reflect personal convicr
tion is much greater.

The most important and progressive ims
provement, however, is likely to be overlook-
ed. Stated simply, the new system u ll tend
to bring- the inevitable campaign politics out
ilito the open. Of course, there will be the
usual conspiring and manipulation ol‘ votes.
But the point still holds tllat the new sys—
tem allows for a campaign to be waged \lg-
orously above board and before the eyes 01
the students. Already vigorous campaigns
have been launched in favor of the out-
standing candidates, and student interest
has been aroused more than three weeks be—
fore election day. '

This is a healthy sign. The more sincere
interest in student government that can be
stirred up the next few weeks, the better
chance for a superior leader to be chosen as
Student Council president. And the more

tem for

the election of Student Council
president has been born. 11" only, from curi-

lilielihood that student government may
survive to greet the class of ’45.

 

News Views

Harris Attacks
New Propaganda
For War Hysteria

nywmmno.nnrrlc.

Hardly twenty-four hours pass
these days Without at least one
official blandishment from the
nation’s capitol to the effect that
the citizens of these United
States need have no great fear
of involvement in active mi 'tary
operations. It Franklin D. is not
drooling sugary phrases about
“all old short. of war." one or
more of his less adept henchmen
is spreading the doctrine that the
future of American youth is
safer than an old»fztshioned Sun~
any-school picnic.

Yet at the same time all this
Iailacious drivel is being poured
down the undiscrimlnnting Ameri-
can throat, there is developing
this country a, war psychosis
alarmingly analogous to that
which ﬂourished hero in 1917.

Today, just as when the Im-
perial German government was
considered number one menace to
’the true light of Christian civili—
zation, the American public has
been aroused to an intense hatred
of certain nations as being a
resurrected Scourge oi Attila.
During the first World war, it
was Koissr Bi —now world’s
champion Woodrchopperiwho was
denounced as Beelzebuh in brass
buttons, Now it is Herr Hitler—
a different incarnation of the
devil, pcrhsps, but the same
hatred, the intense and Concen-
trated hatred fundamental to the
growth of the War-fever.

And with this deep-seated
hatred has come a. resurgence of
the mucous, bigoted nationalism
oi those other \Val‘ years.

Demonstrated in various ways,
this reborn chauvinism has again

placed the cpithets, “slacker” 3nd,.

“unsAmCrican,” on the tip of
every “patriotic" tongue. And
those who refuse, even though it
be from Sincere conviction, to en-

 

dorse the current national fore
cign policy are now denoted as
“appeasers.” Also resulting from
our exaggerated patriotism is a
noticeable glorification of the
military strongly reminiscent of
the days of ‘177another in-
dispensable factor in the creation
of a War psychosis.

But more important, perhaps,
than either or these indications
of the groiiing war-Ila e is the
increasing attitude that war for
this country is but a matter of
weeks, nnd rightly so.

Biggest creator of this attitude.
of course, is none other than
our “peaces'lovillg” president, who
is devoting every effort to con
vincing the last loggord American
that. this is our war and that
winning the war is for more im-
portant that planning a post-war
peace. And with such encourage—
ment it is difficult not to ac-
ccpt that hypothesis, especially in
view of the steady march of
events toward that end.

But, or least, one can recognize
that that attitude is being pup
posely crcnted, unit a war-fever
IS developing in this nation, nil
administration ballyhoo notwith-
nlnnding. And so rccogni iig, one
con ii: least rcmsc to be token
into the war-llmvks‘ camp along
with the unthinking masses.

Talk Explains
Grinnell Plan

Morningside Students
Are Cri ical of Changes
Told in Stevens' Speech

(Reprinted from the Monihigsido
Collegian Reporter.)

in o poll recenty taken, only n
small majority favored the Grin-
nell plan of college curriculum
which was explained in chapel by
Dr. Samuel Stevens, president of
Grinnell college.

Approximately 53 per cent of
the students questioned favored
the plan; while the remaining 47
per cent were decidedly against it,
Those opposed to this unorthodox
mcthod were mostly male stu-
dents. The reason given for their
dislike was mainly that the plan
did not provide for a technical
nnd specific educatio but pro-
duced a more broad knowledge.
It was the female students who
were greatly in favor of the plan
because of the broad and old type
liberal art education.

Some of those people contacted
refused to give n definite opinion
either way. They had few ub-
jectiolls lo the plan in general and
would favor it entirely if sev-
eral changes were made. one stu
dent suggested more courses to
choose from; objecting to the
severe cut in the number of
courses available in certain de—
partments. Another objected to
the limited number of courses ofs
rel-ed each semester. Limited to
only four courses each term, the
student would study at the most.
if honor courses were taken, only
35 different subjects in four years.
While in other colleges, approxi<
mately 40 courses would be the
minimum a student would be as
fcred in four years.

One student who favored the
plan stated that he liked the
fact that class attendance was
not required. Another approved
of only four courses which he
thought would simplify studying.
