First Convention to Open

0 The Scarlet and Black and Campus Politics—An Editor ial.

Thursday evening there was issued in
the Quadrangle dining-room the best
piece of propaganda that has been seen
on the campus for some time, The con-
tent of this material held that, because

Clark hall residents were in virtual con-
trol of the Scarlet and Black, the paper
was taking sides in current campus
Moreover,
hinted that the Scarlet and Black was

da sheet said,

In replying to these changes, it can
only be said that the student news-
paper is trying to be strictly non-par-
tisan in campus politics, and that Dib—
ble hall is making an attempt to hurt
candidate Kenet Pearce through a me-

dium with which Pearce is in no way

Scarlet and Black story (the candidates
who had withdrawn from the conven—

The question was raised “Does this

0 ‘DR fAUSTUS' ---A PUPPET SHOW 0

 

European and American Student
Elections Compared by Refugees

When the town men nhmcd their
delegates Thursday night at the
White House, two members 0!
that organization watched the
proceedings with much curiosity
and some amazement.

These men were Peter Fl'ytb.
sophomore student who came to
Grinnell from Czechoslovakia after
the Nazi invasion, and Alfred
Pommcr, who left Austria when
that counlry was drawn into Hitc
let’s orbit.

Both men recalled similar
moorings at universities in Europe
and both agreed that the meet.-
ings more and the meeting in
which they took part Thursday
night, though alike in some re-
spects, had o different undercur-
rent of meaning.

Fryth said that he was partic-
ularly impressed by the noise, the
conversation, and by the many
differences of opinion which he
heard expressed That was quite
different from the European stu-
dent elections which he recalled.

This difference was brought

out more clearly by the expressed
feeling of most of the town men,

who said that they thought the
meeting was unusually friction-
less, and lime disseusion in the
ranks.

“The method in Germany is
different,” Fryth stated. “Here
there was ccmpaigning. There at
an election of this nature a uni-
iormcd man would tell the group
the person for whom they were to
vote. There would be no argu'
ments as to merit, no questions.
No one would dnr A uniform
represents anthon'ty.”

Pommer noticed the great in-
Lel'est and enthusiasm shown. He
commented on the large attend-
ance. “At our meetings in Vienna
no one showed up," he said. This
interest, he thought, was one of
the major points of dlssimiliarity.

“Student government was not
efﬁective with the faculty,"Pom-
mer added,

At the close of the meeting, the
sold front which was the result
of the vote. brought a further
statement from Fryth:

“We seem to fight ‘eye for eye
and tooth for tooth’ but after it
is over, we put the eyes and teeth
back.”

Puppet Show
,To Be Given

University Professor
Will Present Story
Of 'Dr. Faustus'

“Dr, Faustus," a puppet play,
will be presented by Dr. Mono
Spann of the University of Iowa,
in the auditorium or the Alumni
Recitation hail Tuesday at 4:30
p m.

The play is based on the old
German narrative poem, “Dr.
Faustus.” The story concerns a
doctor who sells his soul to the
dcvil for servics of 24 years by
Satan. The dcvrl tricks him out
of the time and then cnrrics him
off to Hell.

Dr. Spann, who is from the
German department of the univer-
sity,, will furnish the English dia-
logue of the play as well as op-
erate the puppets which came
originally from Hohenstein, Sax<
any, 15 years ago, These glove
puppets, Lhough simpler in action
than marionettes, allow for more
cxprcssion and and character rep-
resentdtion.
