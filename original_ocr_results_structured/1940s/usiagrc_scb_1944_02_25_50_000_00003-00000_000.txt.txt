College Studets Serve Red Cross
It Was 5:30 a. m. Out of his tent
pitched in an olive grove crawled
“Penny" Pennington, American
Red Cross assistant field director,
to get the first mail he had re<
ceived since landing with the.
troops in Italy: a letter from
“Who's Who.”

Back in New York some of the
former students of Dr. R. Corbin
Pennington, City College profes-
sor, were probably getting in a
little midnight cramming, fully
aware that if they never go to
war. the war has already come
to them by way of the things
those still on campus can, and
must do. They can, for example,
support the work of the Amerir
-can Red Cross, in which college
students have a two-fold stake,
their fellow students are both
serving and being served by the
Red cross.

A wide variety of wheels and
colleges, and many parts of the
country, are represented in the
ranks of American Red cross
workers The staff shall Ameri-
can Red Cross club in North Af-
rica has lnclllded,-fol‘ instance,
former students at William and
Mar, Colorado State, Lake For»
est and Middlebiiry colleges.

some of these Red Cross work-
ers have left their academic in»
tcrests behind. Others are follow-
ing the professional line for
which their college work prepared
them. In the latter group are so-
cial workers. playground and ath-
letic directors, while former
teachers, research assistantsand
others are serving coffee and
doughnuts from the batch of a
chibmobile, writing letters for the
wounded, or doing other jobs new
to them,

College students are serving
the American Red Cross on the
home front, too. in many colleges
throughout the country the stu-
dents run their own campus Red
Cross units. And everywhere they
are pal‘tlclpall'lg in essential
Red 01055 activities on and off
campus. The Red Cross flag flies
regularly outside campus build-
ings to announce that coeds are
busy knitting and sewing and
making bandages for the Red
Cross. Club and fraternity groups
sign up his body for visits to
Red Cross blood donor centers.
And everywhere college girls are
serving as Red Cross volunteers
in hospitals and canteens.

As a sort uL sy or or" their
two-fold stake in the continuation
of its work, the American Red
Cross serves college students as
a meeting ground. and American
Red Cross clubs overseas arefrei
quently the scene of collegiate
reunions. It was not by accident.
for instance, that Sigma Chi
brothers now with our armed

forces in Britain chose an Ameri»
can Red Cross club for a recent
reunion dinner. Those who have
left campus to serve their coun-
try miss the companionship of
college life. But, through the
American Red Cross, it is possle
ble for them to get together for
a coke or a bull session that
brings Alma Mater closer and
makes the war Seem, for the nice
mont, very far away.

“Alas, alackiKatey, I'll be back".l
He was joined by Land and \’ill-‘

John Perry renewed his efforts,
and is now nightly seen heading
for the quad, while Case locked
himself in his room and settled
down to an evening of drinking—
cokes.

,Meanwhile Fry and Simmons
rounded up some soaprboxes and
were seen extolling the Virtues
of the combat engineers. Life
goes on much the same in Read
though. Camel-y was seen study—

Cole was going on sick call, and

Popejoy was \vli ng his gll‘l‘

So you see, life in Read has-

Schoolwork continues as ever.
Hurkins, Lash, Triplett, and

them in study so I guess I'll
close. My! Wotta busy day!
