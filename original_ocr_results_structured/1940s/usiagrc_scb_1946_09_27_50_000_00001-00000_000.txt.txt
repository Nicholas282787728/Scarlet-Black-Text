Mrs. Jan Ne‘ely. wife of former
Grinnellian Bob Neely, has spent
the last three weeks painting on

the walls of Cowles hall dining
room eight life-sized color por—
traits depicting exCrinnell ath-
let in all phases of sporting ac-
tivities. ‘

’Spenking of her work the at-
tractive young artist said, “So
far as I know, the method I’m
using for decorating the dining
room is unique. From still pic-

to be painted.

“By following the lines and
shades of the slides. 1 can cap-
ture in minute detail the various
expressions of the athletes, with
every oharaceristic faithfully ex-
pressed."

Comfortably established in her
profession, Jan Neely is enjoying
especially the work she is doing
at Crinnell. She's fond of sports,
so her mural sports in Cowles
have extra interest.

She is never without an {indi-
ence of college boys. “I’m getting
more than enough requests from
the fellows to paint pin-ups in
their rooms,)1 she laughs,

Brown Stresses
Man’s Freedom

Suart Gerry Brown, professor
of English, addressed chapel—goers
Thursday morning on the subjeect
“On Being Free.” The only free
man, stated Professor Brown, is
the one who possesses a free
spirit which includes self-mastery
and the a ility to be free any—
where, anytime. The 20th century
man, thinking only in terms of
himself, so far has failed utterly
in advancing toward personal
freedom. Man himself. according
to Mr. Brown, cannot actually be
free, but his spirit can, thus end—
ing the war of man within him-
self.

George Mally, Rawson, sopho—

senior, assisted in the liturgy of
