A complete iailroad‘ system ~ built, owned and
operated by student engineers ~ is now running on
the Dartmouth College cam us. The complicated and
intricate mechanisms or the igger Island at Pompan-
oosuc Railroad malte it one of the most unusual
miniature systems in the U. 5,, ior it was constructed
in its entirety by rrrerntaers at the ciuo sponsoring
lhz unique proiect. , .

Conceived only a year ago by Al Haxen, a student
in Dartmouth‘s Thayer School cl Engineering, the
project has set out to duplicate the methods ol the
larger railroads The layout is housed in the Thayer
School, and consists ol185leetoltraclt arranged in
the form of a complex series of ﬁgure eights. Engin-
eering problems galore have been introduced to malte
the curves sale For high speed travel.

Its equipment is entirely hand made and represents
an enormous amount of time and labor. In the picture
below that blueprint which Baron and his associates
are studying is part ol a roll at least ten feet long and
is just lor one locomotive! Even the track is all hand
made,- each tie being separately stapled in place and
the track being made lrorn narrow gauge rolled steel.
The swilchboards are a complicated mass of electrical
engineering, but are so efficient that one operator

can handle the entire system. DistslPhatathNalux . NW“ "‘9 “”"em WD'l‘ma"‘h‘p '" EVE" ”‘9
