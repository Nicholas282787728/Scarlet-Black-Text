to quitting the cigaret habit,
have been recommended by the
alliance. For your guidance we
are reprinting them, as follows:

1, Purchase five cents worth
of gentian root or camorile blosr
soms and chew the stuff during
the day when a desire to smoke
appears.

2. Take ollerhalf a teaspoonful
each of rochclle salts and cream
of tartar each morning before
breakfast for a week.

3. Change dietetic habits.
Smokers supposedly are fond of
highly seasoned foods and stimr
ulatmg drinks.

4. Keep away from smokers
and the tobaccmsmoke atmos,
phere for three weeks.

5. Take Turkish baths twice
during the first two weeks.

6 Keep out in the open air as
‘much as possible and keep mind
occupied.

After reading the rules over,
I feel even more compassionate
towards the nicotine fiend. I guess
I won’t quit after all. It‘d be
much simpler to get Mr. Clapp
to teach me the technique of
rolling my own.
