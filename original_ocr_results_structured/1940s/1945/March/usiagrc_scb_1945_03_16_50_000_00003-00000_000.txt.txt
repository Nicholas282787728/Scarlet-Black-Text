Worth Library Prize Given

For Senior 30

Addi’rional Prize Money
Given By Original Donor

A $500 gift from Harry 1. Worth
of the Worth Lumber company
of Seattle, Washington, was an-
nounced today by president Sain-
,uel N. Stevens. The amount
supplements previous gifts of
Mr. Worth. the income from
which is used for the Personal
Library prize awarded to two
seniors each year. Mr, Worth 1

is a. Grinnell alumnus of the class
of 1907, '

the present system having been
established in 1931. To encour—
age and give recognition to the
owning of good books, senior col~
letters of the two best libraries
win 310 and so respectively in
books of their choosing, plus add-
ed volumes contributed by vari-
ous publishers.

Each student may collect a li—
brary along those lines in which
he is personally interested. It
is felt by the faculty committee
on Prizes and Awards, which
idministers the contest, that a
good library embodies and rep—
resents the personality of its
collector and owner.

Says Mr. worth: “One of my
most permanent pleasures has
been the reading of good hooks.
Magazines have their place. but
fine books are written with much
greater care and thought. The
reading of serious books is an ac—
quired taste. but it is worth cul-
tivating and should not be crowd—
ed out by newspapers, picture
magazines, current reviews, and
digests."

On March 12, a mass meeting
was held in the little Lhcatel‘l
under the direction of the League,
Board. l

At the meeting, Miss Nellie
Glcason reported that there is
usually room for thirty guests in
the dining room. If students wish,
to get guest tickets for the‘

them in the early part of the
week. For special dinners when
table service is used, students
should inform their house chair-
man if they do not intend to be
there, especially if they have
signed for that meal.

Miss Gardner announced that,
no out of town permissions will]
be granted over the Easter week—l
end. The total of thirtyrfive perr
missions will be granted for the
whole quadrangle for each of the
weekends of March 17, 24, and.
April 7. Each cottage has 3‘
quota of out. of town pcrmis-,
sions which is based on the num-
‘bcr of students in the cottage,‘
‘ Miss Gardner also commented
on the examination days which
be held for all students.
Five dollar cut days will pre-
cede and follow test days.

Her chief criticisms were of
the cliquishness and the sloppi-
ness of dress of the college p0p~
.ulation.
