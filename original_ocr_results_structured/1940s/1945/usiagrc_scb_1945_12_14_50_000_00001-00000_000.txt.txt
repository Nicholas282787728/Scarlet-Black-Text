Social CommiH’ee
Studies , Possibility
Oi '46 Gadabou’rsi

The social committee, composed
of both students and faculty
members, in a meeting held on
Wednesday afternoon, considered
the rerestablishment of Gada-
bouts. stated Betty Montague,
student council president.

I Gadabouts. as it was organized
before the war, was a self-sup-
porting, student controlled and
operated organization which spon—
sored a large percentage of the
social activities throughout the
school year. Funds were supplied
by the sale of season tickets
which admitted students to all
ithe activities backed by the
{ group,

At Wednesday's meeting, Miss
Evelyn Gardner, dean of women,
‘submitted financial reports from
the last two years in which Gad~
abouts were in operation. The so-
cial committee showed a very
favorable attitude in regard to
its reestablishment. ,

’I‘wo definite problems were
,considered. First, the financial
support of the students must be
assured before plans can be’ made.
Both date and non-date affairs
would include ell‘students in the
Gadabont, program. Second, two
students would be required to
manage the system since it has
Ibeen and would continue to be
is student project.

j The social committee would al-
‘so welcome requests from cana—
pus organizations which desire to
take charge of some Saturday
night programs next semester. A
January 9 meeting will reconsider.
:the Cadabouts question and plan
the calendar for the remainder
of the year.
