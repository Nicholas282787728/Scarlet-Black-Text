ment, has resigned this position
in order to devote himself fully
to the teaching of voice and de-
velopment of choral music at
Crinnell, it has been announced
by President Samuel N. Stevens,
Nomim Coodbrod, assistant pro-
fessor of piano, has been named
by Dr. Stevens as Mr. West's suc-
cessor.

Plans for this year's centennial
celebration involve development of
choral groups drawn from the
student body, alumni, and the
Congregational church choirs cf
rowa. This work, in addition to
planned development of a concert
choir, will require much of Mr.
West's time.

In recognition of Mr. West’s
record as chairman, Dr. Stevens
said, "During the past five years,
Mr. West has successfully devel-
oped a distinguished music facin-
ty, and expanded and enriched
the work of the department. As
a result of extensive concert ap-
pearances by lilm and by mem-
bers of the faculty, the music do
psrhnent has enjoyed a phenom-
enal increase in student registm
tion.and has gained in recogni-
tion as one of the fine music do,
partments of the middle west.

“It is expected that under Mr.
Goodbrod's chairmansnip, there
will be a continued development
of the music department as an in-
tegral part of the college," Dr.
Stevens added.

Mrs. Moonlight is a realistic

The three sets take place in 1898,

made on her wedding day is re-

has been granted to her, and as
a mother of a five year old

The complications brought to
her life by her never ending
youthfulness lead to an intricate
interweaving of threads in this

the third act, 1945, still show
