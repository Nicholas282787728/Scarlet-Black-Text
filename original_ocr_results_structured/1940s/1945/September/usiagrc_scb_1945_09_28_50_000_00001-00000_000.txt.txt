Cottage social chairmen are
plotting to give the lie to the
“Saturday night is the lonesom-
cst night in the week” theme
with their plans for house par-
ties this Saturday.

Langaa hall put in the first bid
for the swimming pool. After
the splash party there will be a
spread in the clubroorn—a motion
that needs no seconding, accord-
ing to social chairman Marjorie
Webster.

Patricia Hardy, elected social
chairman of Rawson, explained a
spider-web hunt in which “the
contestants tangle with string

and prizes, not Spiders."

Seniors Take
Minor Comps

FacuI‘Iy Passes Resolution
To Change Examinations
For Bachelor's Degree

Seniors will be required to take
a comprehensivc examination in
their minor fields unless this
field is so closely connected with
their majors that its inclusion in
the major comprehensive is pos-
sible, it was decided in last Mon»
day's faculty meeting.

The full text of the resolution,

is .15 follows: "Where the field
of concentration permits, the
comprehensive examination shall
cover the an ﬁeld. Such ex-
amination shall be arranged in
pnnferenoe with the department
concerned. “'here sucll examina-

tion is not practicable, one-third
of the examination shall be on
the supplementary subject. If
two supplementary subjects are
offered, the candidate shall take
the examination in the one in
which he has had the larger
amount of work, or if the two
are of equal size, the candidate
shall choose one."

Until this year, seniors have
taken comprehensives for their
bachelor's degrees only in their
major fields. These tests consist
of three three-hour -aininations.
and me senior is excused from
taking finals in all courses in
which his grades are up. Under

the changed program, unless the
minor may be included in the ms.—
]or ccmprchensives, there will be
one comprehensive in the minor
and two in the major field,
