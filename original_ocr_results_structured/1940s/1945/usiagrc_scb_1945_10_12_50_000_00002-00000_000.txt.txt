The Honor: Sysiem - -

The whole concept of our honor system
is being lie-examined tllis fall by campus
groups making an effort to understand and
evaluate it, If some of tllis scrutiny seems
petty or uncalled for, it is up, to those who
pnderstand and have worked under the
system to make clear to its confused critics
its value. Rte-examination of the honor syse
tenl is a good thing. In its present embry
onic form, it becomes stronger through
discussion and widespread interest. If there
are rough“ spots in the way it is organized,
now is the'time to detect and amend them.

The Scarlet and Black favors this sys-
tem, not as all ultimate goal, but as a
great step forward ill student government.
We saw it come to Grinnell, fighting its Wily
through misunderstandings and organizar

. tional difficulties to almost unanimous ap-
proval of the student body. Last year and
the spring before, a relaxing air of infor-
mality AND GOOD CONDUCT came with
the honor system into the classroom No
longer were our three hour finals endurance
tests, with anything that could pass the
faculty eye considered good sport. It be
came possible to leave the room without

being immediately accused of running out
to catch up on your reading. It relieved
the professor of simply sitting and policing
the class for three hours. Both students
and faculty agreed that if the students
could conduct it in the right spirit, it was
a great step forward.

We remember the fi t Violation under
the honor system. . oh yes. there have been
sonle, and these were reported. They were
faculty violations of the clause ill the sys
tem requiring that students be given one
week’s notice of an hour exam. To our
skeptical eye, this clause seemed unenforc-
able, used as we were ill high school to a
dogmatic uncoopelative facility attitude.
When we foulld that upoll being reminded
of their digressions from the STUDENT-
INITIATED, STUDENT-PASSED, and
ADMINISERED rules, the faculty actually
postponed these tests, we began to see that
with the support that it was getting from
students and faculty, the honor system was
really working ill the way in which it had
been intended.

This year, for the first time, the honor
court has been established. It was ill the
minds of the founders of the honor system
from the first, because they were students
of history and government. They knew
that even in the most ideal society, a gov-
ernment without sanctions is weak. , a law
without provisions for enforcement and pell-
alties for violations becomes just so lnaily
pretty words upon the books.

As ill the adult society in which we are
expected to live Very soon, we have per-
sonal responsibilities under the honor Sysr
tem, and some of us seek to avoid these
responsibilities. We are not only bound to
refrain from cheating ourselves, but we
must protect the great majority of our
fellow students from the cheater, . To some
students here today this is objectionable as
”squealing." Let them be reminded that
“squealing" is an underrworld term, gar-
nered from the honorramong-thieves idea.
In a mature, intelligent society, we protect
our neighbors from the thief in the night.
If we see someone picking the pocket of a
passerrby, we’ll call the police. Why then
should we tolerate among us the intellectual
thief?

The honor court helps guarantee that
this thief will be held accountable, when
proved guilty, for his waywardness, in
exactly the same way ill which the courts
of the United States hear and sentence a
criminal, who has abused his rights as zl
citizen.

A Little Red Wagon

ny Constance Rounds

About 5 years ago when
football was going strong at
Grinnell there was a little wage
on built to haul the public ud-
dress equlpmcnt over to Ward
field. It was an attractive lit-
tle wagon ivitli [W0 shiny bicycle
wheel: and a nice red body. For

two short years it performed its-

duty well »

covered the little red wagon as
a likely truck horse for furniture,
books and other articles too
heavy for feminine transporte-
tion, All the work usually done
by some four hundred college
follows fell to this unfortunate
little cert Once it. calmly re.
laxed and collapsed both wheels
under a heavy load of books.
Eight dollars put the wheels back

OPEN ronun |

To the Editor:

We believe that the entire came
pus is aware of the highly eon-
troversial issues which have
arisen as a. result of the mass
meeting held on October 10,
1945. But from much of the
cuiran discussmn in regard to
the continuation of the honor
court it is obvious that Lhe real
questions over which we disagree
have been lost in a cloud of su-
perfluous rhetoric. In order to
olarlfy the position of many of
those who have demanded anothr
er opportunity to express them-
selves in this matter, we, the tin
dersigned, wish to submit the
following factors which should
help che oligarchy to understand
why we object so strenuously to
the mess meeting, its conduct,
and its legislative action

First of all, the very term
“honor court” is a misnomer; if
we are to have this court and
the organized spy system which

it implies, then we autoinsucallyl

remove the conditions under
which honorable conduct is feas-
ible,

Secondly, if it appears we are
to be burdened with this court,
we object to its present organ
zaLlon in that it provides no dem—
ocratic means of defense and vi-
oiates the assumption that one
accused is innocent until proven
guilty. We believe that most
serious consideration sh uld be
given to an amendment requiring
two witnesses to the Violation.
smce democratic procedure must
recognize the equality of the
pledged word. In this respect
also we object to the fact that
the court is composed of appoint
ed members, and that there is no
representative of the faculty on
it. ,

And thirdly, we wish to point
out that a mass meeting is held
for the purpose of obtaining the
opinions of phase who will be
concerned by its action, The Stu»
dents were not given any advance
idea of the subject that was to
he discussed at the meeting. In

short, we object to the totally uni

parliamentary means by which
all opposition to the honor court
was squelchcd,

On the positive side of the
ledger, we feel that our construc-
tivc criticisms may best be put
into effect by a more liberalized
policy of student relations with
the facility and a more complete
realization of indivrclual honor in
all the operations of the college.
To this end, we have already peti-
tioned that. the mussmcetihg be
rc-hcld. At that time we expect
to be in a position to more clear-
ly outline a program whereby the
liberal revision of the honor sys-
tem may be effected, and the stir
clcnts as a whole may be given a
wider opportunity to achieve the
ideals of Grinnell college.
