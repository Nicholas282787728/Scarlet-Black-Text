A New Leaf - -

During the two weeks of its operation,
the food concession in the Cylcone, Cellar
has come in for its share of‘ opprobrious
slams and side glances about “organization”
and “equipment" and “service." The time
has come to face the future by looking
backito judge the trend by considering the
facts in the case.

Organized as a subsidiary of the Student
Council and the YWCA, responsibility for
the concession has been divided between
these two groups. Student Council has
charge of financing and supplying the Cellar,
while the Y staffs the Cellar and serves
the food.

A vote of thanks is in order for the crews
of Student Council and Y workers who have
donated their time and talents to build

Constance Rounds

some sort of workable organization on the
makeshift groundwork apportioned to them.
Strugﬂing to “make a go" of tile existing
conditions has no doubt developed their in»
dividual senses 01' responsibility in true
Grlnnllcll tradition, but it has done little
toward solving the problem 01' providing an
efficient food concession on campus.

Obviously, such descentl lized control
makes for conflicts. There is no final stu-
dent authority whose word is law in the
Cellar kitchen. Yet this has been regarded
as ll student project. The students appoint.-
ed to deal with it have (lone all in their
power to succeed under the restrictions on
their authority, but rather than improving,
the situation has been stalelnated.

Student unions are no novelty to the
nation’s campllsesithe place- for food and
relaxation on campus is granted as a nece
ity. However, Gr'nnell’s most recent L-
telnpt seems destined for a hopelessly in
efficient career because cer uiu fundamental
needs inherent ill running such a concession
have been blithely ignored.

First of all sucll a JOI) requires fulltinle
participation. One person who has supremo
authority should be on duty during all hours
when food is being sold, to supervise and
regulate. If this person is to be a student,
he should not be required to spend the time
necessary for this unless he is compensated
adequately. The posi on of central author-
ity should be placed under regul ‘ campus
employment, subject to application, not
appointment, ’

The alternative is the equally apparent
solution of granting the control of the con-
cession to a person outside the student body,
a person qualified by experience to run such
a business. This person would assume all
costs, risks, and accept all profits,

. If the‘Cyclone Cellar concession is to func-
tion 1n its expected capacity, fulfilling the
needs of students, some definite change
must he made in its administration Allowed
to proceed under the present system, the
concession faces the prospect of decreasing
business—costly in time, money, and service.
