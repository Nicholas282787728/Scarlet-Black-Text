GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

From-Hie
BLEACHERS

By Bob Powell

At last it’s come. We don’t
know much and can say less, but
sports are definitely back. And
it looks good.

Last Monday night. at their
housemeoting, Cowles and Dibble
jointly elected as their combined
intramural chairman, Ray O‘Bri-
en. It has been three years since
that position was of much im-
portance, and now as an indicae
tion of the men's feelings on the
subject, they have elected this
temporary officer even before
school formally opened. O'Brien
has already divided the men into
four teams for the playing of in-
tramural sports. These sports
will probably include touch root-
ball (6 man). basketball, possibly
wrestling, swimming, baseball;
tennis. cross-country, and per-
haps golf. More about this later
when plans are more definite.

As far as intercollegiate sports,
especially football, go. that is the
big question mark. At present,

Women ’5 Sports Begin

With new additions to the staff

and to the curriculum, the womr
en's physical education depart-
ment is prepared for a new
year.

Miss Dorothy Pulley, senior
staff member and instructor in
health education, and Miss Faye
Wensei are the new members of
the staff.

Riding is the additional sport.
The college stable and rings are
north of the Men's Halls on Park
St. One hundred twenty-nine stu-
dents have indicated that they.
Wish to participate in this activ-
ity. Capt. Harry V. Moore, who
has had many years‘ experience
teaching riding, both in and out
of the army, will instruct. Rlding
has not been offered since 1940-
41.

es wili be held in the morning.

there are some 25 names on a
list marked “Interested in Foot-
ball.” President Stevens has prev-
iously announced that Grinnell
would have a full sports program
during the 1945-46 season, provid-
ing interest justified it. Now with
our new coach, Mr. Reed, here,
the question lies in the hands
of the athletic committee and
President stevens to decide if
Grinnell should have inter-college
iate football. Equipment has been
issued and preliminary practices
have been held, but at present,
it is best to assume a pessimistic‘
attitude and expect the worst,
which would be intramural tack-
le football. But we will soon
know.

As for the other sports. we are
assured of intercollegiate basket.
ball, with games already being
scheduled, cross~country, base-
ball, golf, tennis, and swimming.
Yep: Things are really looking
up!
