Hell Week

. i . Beards

Now we've seen evei-ytliin - A
ration of almost six women to
each man isn't enough. Last
Thursday the prep mcn, all 50
of them. further upset the balance
by masquerading as bobby-soxel‘s!
Add this to the iact that all the
Dibble men are refusing to shave,
as part of the traditional Pioneer
Week, and you have an extremely
peculiar situation. It's almost as
had as if the men hadn't returned
at all. a

But it's all part of the fun, as
the men on the campus combine
“Hell Week” for the preps, and
Pioneer days. This idea began
several years ago when the Grin»
nell footbali team entertained Col—
orado college here, and the whole
campus went “wild west", for the
occasion. After that time, the
event became an annual affair.

Revival of “buttonin‘g”. the tra-
ditional form of prgpvbeating,
came Tuesday of this week. Wed-
nesday the prep men compiied
to a request of dress backwards.
and Thursday they appeared in
women’s attire, complete to leg-
paint.‘ nail-polish. and lipstick.
Today, the campus was invaded
by the preps. this time in
garb of Sascnachawenopa -Indi-
ans. What will tomorrow bring?

This week-end promises to be
great fun for the prep men as
they carry out the traditional
“Hell Week" projects. which will
terminate in their initiation to
their halls.

FASHION
FLASHES

lsy Aime Hellcliusch

After taking a quick look at
the men on campus (as who
hasn’t?) we've decided that they
are running the women a close
race in college fashions.

Color is really running iainpant
tn the men's wardrobes. Jf'n you
don't believe us, take a look at
Bob Williamson's ensemble of a
fire-engine red shirt and yellow
crocheted tie with matching yel-
low suspenders; the brown and
powdcrblue checked sport jacket
of Gene Southern; Mac' ("we’re
through") Grant's “shortie” ties
in red and yellow wool; and that
sandcolored sport jacket with
the tricky shoukler-tohip pockets
that Monty Ruekberg wears with
such a collegiate air.

Some of the most fascinating
outfits worn on campus are those
built around a basic suit that
Uncle Sammy handed out. John
Moon cuts a dashing figger in
gray :lannrl pants, his Honor c.

sweater, suntan shirt, and khaki,

ti Ward Schwab sports a steel»
blue sweater and suntan trousers
held up by plastic suspenders;
and Jim Carnahan turns many a
head in his pearl—gray trench-
:oat. yellow muffler, and plaid
shirt.

Dean DeWitt gives suntans a
formal note by the addition of a

Orches’rra RecH-al
To Be On Nov. 29

The Grinnell orchestra wul give
a concert on Nov. 29 at 8 o'clock
in Herrick chapel, it was announc-
ed by Otto T. Jeliuek, assistant
proftssor or music.

An original composition, “Pas-
torale," for tlute and strings,
composed several ycars ago by
Ml'. Hoyle Carpenter, instructor
.n music. will be played tor the
first time at Grinnell. Julie Tre»
gaskis, Haiiies sophomore, will be
ilute soloist.

Othcr numbers on the program
ire a ”Prelude," “Choraln' and
Fugue,” by Bach, the
Symphony in c major", and vare
iations on ‘Pop Goes the Weasel,"
for which there is a Saxophone
trio consisting of Mr. ‘Slmmons,
Mary Pederscn. town student, and
Nathan ottens, Cowles freshman.

The “Thorn Rose Waltz" by

Tschaikowsky will conclude the
program.
herringbone jacket; a combina-
tion of russet corduroy pants and
a red and yellow plaid shirt top-
ped by a navy pea jacket provides
a casual "gadding" outfit for Jack
Man'key; Bill Findley brightens
up his officer's uniforms with an
Honor G sweater or a gay, plaid
shirt.
, So-o—o, we'd say that the men's
[clothes are chic at the drop of
a hat in fact, we'd even
borrow a hat to drop.
