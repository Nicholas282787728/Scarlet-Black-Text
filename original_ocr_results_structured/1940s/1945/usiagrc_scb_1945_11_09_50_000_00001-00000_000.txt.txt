Milk Producﬁon
LCur’railed ln Area;
College Quo’ra Cul

One of the biggest gripes
,hcard on campus during the past

few weeks has been the “milk sit-
uation.“ In order to Clarify the

issue, some facts must be brought

to light. l
. The quantity of milk available
.in and around the Des Mouies area,
Iof wtuch Crin'neil is a part, has
lbeen materially reduced recently
for several reasons. Farm hands,
|normully engaged in dairy work
have been called upon to assist
it work. necessitated by this
year's late harvest. Another fac-‘
tor to be mentioned is that a
number of herd cattle, which for-
merly produced milk, have been
slaughtered to help relieve thel
critical meat situation in thel
country. So fewer herds reinainl
as a source for raw milk.

Relief has been requested by
dairies in the immediate Grinnell
area, but acute shortage of dairy
products in Des Moines and other
surrounding cities has prevented
relief to any noticeable extent,

According to Miss Nellie Glea-
son, director of foods for Grin-
nell college, 90 to 100 gallons of
milk are needed daily to supply
both dining rooms with drinking
milk only. During the past few
weeks, powdered milk has been

used in cooking, because of the
inadequate supply of whole milk.

This being the problem as it
stands at present, it appcdrs that
there is no immediate relief in
sight. When sum cnt milk bee
comes available, it will be includ—
ed in the Griniicll college diet,
Miss Gleason promised

tenor, will appear in Herrick

chapel at 8:30 tonight dsntlle second artist in the current

concert series.

Mr. fle Boer will be accompanied by' Norman
lGoodbrod, associate professor

of music.

Mr. de Boer is a graduate 01' Whittier college in Cali-

Hendrik de Boer is a most

hour of tossing the conversational
ball, Mr. de Boer told of his life
in Hollywood, his ambitions in
the field of music, and how he
likes to spend his leisure time.

He is now living in the former
home of Hurd Hatfield, the man
who. played Dorian Gray, in the
picture of the same name. It is
here thnt he makes his headquar-
t;rs. and is at present completing
the circle that this tour has
taken. He hopes to be there in
time for Christmas,

“This tour is a prelude to the
work I hope to do some day,"
said Mr. de Boer. “I would very
much like to study in Italy and
France, for it is from there that
a large amount of the music that
lyric tenors sing comes." To more
or less clarify this statement, he
added that the only way u: really
learn the language and its music,
is to go to the country, meat the
people, and get your information
first hand,

Much of his leisure liine is
spent in romping with his nieces
and nephews, of which there seem
to be quite a number. “I usually
have my pockcts full, and they
swarm over me to see what their
own private Santa Claus has
brought this time", he laughed.

Much of Mr. de Boer“: person-
a‘ity can be attributcd to the fact
that he is modest in the face of
his accomplishments. He loves
his singing, and breaks into song

position,

de Boer has had singing parts
‘Hl several movies, among them
“'Music for Millions.” “Lake Ple-
cid Serenade," and “Ziegﬁeld
Follies," the latter of which has
not yet been released.

USO work and concert, movie
,‘and radio appearances have occu-
pied most of the young tenor's
ltlme in the past tnrce years. His
appearance at Grinnell comes as
l a part of a ten month tour of the
east and middle-west. He plans
to join a small opera~ group which
