Again: “Here’s to the Dibble Eagle up on High’ -’

By Barbara Buckley

Its independence safely estab-
lished at the hall elections last
Monday evening, Dibble Hall
again comes into its own, An
old Clark man, Frederick Wolf,

assumed .the helm, while an old
Smith man, William Findley,
was chosen to assist him as vice-
president. Over in Cowles at the
same time .the freshmen orga-
nized themselves under Jack
Hartley, Bill Hoskins, and Mike
Alft.

A long line of tradition stands
in back of these new Dibble men.
We dont remember the old days
very well but a file of copies of

the S it B yielded much light on
the situation.

Dibble made a name [or itself
on the campus in intramural. it
will be recalled that in 1942-3
Dibble was the winner of the in-
tramural cup. The same affinity
for sports has always been chm-
acteristic of this hall. Also in
scholarship the gunners wok the
coke. \Vho doesn’t remember
diaman, Gardner, and Gadient
and their grade-point averages?
But Dibble was famous for more
than sports and grades.

In 1940, the Dibble faction
went on a two. -day binge of van»
dalism Windows were broken,

even

the halls were scarred up from
a. bonfire, With true hall spirit,

tlle Dibble men presented a front
against criticism and indistcd on

punishing the offenders in in;
own way; but all social privla
leges were revoked for the rest

of the spring semester.
Successfully withstanding the
purge of 1942, Dibble continued

to hit the headlines when it was
threatened with extinction in Ap-

ril of that year. An administra-

doors were damaged, and

dren. In fact, the protests were
such that the proposal was sub-
sequently dropped, and the hall
retained its autonomy.

Those who are seniors now “/1“
well remember the sad year of
1942-3, when the Dibble eagle
moved from the dorms to old Mn»
cy house, up by Merrill Park.
They put on some good parties
there. it will be recalled. Then,
as the season wore on, and as
the draft took more and more
of our heroes, tho hail shifted

protests among the eagles chil-,

Here it held suay un-
til the end of the ycar.

During these last long, long
years, those men who are Dibble

in spirit have had no hall to call
their own. No one needs (to be
told about the new Macy and
the Pine Tree eras. But now we
feel sure that the old regime is
back to stay. We hope the iron
eagle can be resurrected from the
muck of Arbor Lake, wherein it
was cast by jealous Smith men:
or, if this is impossible, that the
museum over in Blair will re-
linquish its feathered copy. We
are waiting for the day when the

eagle will fly again in all its for-
mer glory.

Play Fealures Unusual—Sol

Mrs. Moonlight, the first drama
department production of the
year, presents unusual problems
in costuming and stage setting
because of the lapse in time be-
tween each of the three acts.

The Moonlight household, scene
of the play, must reflect the
change of atmosphere under each
of the three different mistresses
of the house, as well as the
change in years. from 1898, to
1915, to 1945. In the same way,
the costumes in each act must
‘truly portray the fashions of the
corresponding periods.

Assistant professor of drama
Kent Andrews, directing the pro-
duction, offers a unique solution
to the problem of changing the
stage set to keep it in step with
the period reflected, and to in-
tensify the atmosphere created
by each of the mistresses of the
house. The setting undcr con»
struction at thc present time has
a permanent framework which
will remain the same throughout
the play.

This framework consists
stationary wainsccting, base-
board, doorjams, and window
frames 7 in other words, all the

of

els, of walls, are removable, and
will be shifted between the acts.
in thus transforming a one-set»
ting play into a thl‘eersetting one.
there is opportunity to express
the varied mood of, each act
through its background.

To authenticate the costumes.
students, with the assistance of
the college librarians. have been
conducting research, largely in
the magazines of the periods.
Both the costumes and the stage
setting are being made by stu—
dents in drama classes.

Mrs. Moonlight, by Ben W.
Levy, will be presented on Oct.
213 and 27. The roles of Mrs.
Moonlight and her daughter
Jane have been double—cast, and-
a different team will.be used
each night,

This story is a realistic—fan—
tasy set in New York City. It.
concerns the life of a woman
who never grows old, and the
complications that this eternal
youthfuiness brings to her life.
An extremely difficult Character
delineation is found in the roles
of Minnie, the Scottish maid,
and Mr. Moonlight. who must age
47 years in the course of the

 

woodwork in the room. The pan-

play.
