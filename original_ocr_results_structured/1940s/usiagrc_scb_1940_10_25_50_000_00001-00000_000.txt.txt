Last Homecomiug Victory in 1931.

The Pioneers’ last homecoming- victory in 1931 was over
Washington by a score of 25-0. Those were the days wheli
L. Li Watt was the mentor for the Grilinell team. Lookingr

over the more recent losses, we find that Creighton defeated
the Pioneers in 1935, Drake won in 1936, St. Louis took the honors

in 1937, Wﬁhbul‘n won in 1938 and last year the Homecoming vic-

tory went to Beloit.

Grid clashes between Grinnell
and Cornell date back to 1900,
when the Pioneers won the first
contest by a score of do. Since
their, out of 33 games Grinnell has
won 20, Cornell has won 11 and
the teams have tied in two games,
The Pioneers defeated the .Purple

Grinnell gridders last year by a
score of 2570.
