Miss Ellen G, lilusdalc, writing un»

in the Januaiy iiuinher oi the School
Review, especially concerns iiciscli
with the lrtcl: or adequate provision in
the way at college honie liie tor the
women who seek college tiaining. She
also points out wheiein the woman’s;
college tends toward the hoarding

SAYS:

“The mode oi iiriug which women
students are still ohliged to adopt in
the majority oi coeducational institu»
tions, especially state universities,
leaves much to he desired, No suitahle

cational authorities, the women model.
ed their social liic aitci that oi the
men. Side hy side with the iratcrui ,
and iraternity house sprang up tlic
sorority and the sore ti' house. Sela
doni was a snitahle patroncss placed
at the head oi this, hut it was rather
left to the di ection oi the twelve oi
twenty inexperienced girls who were
responsible ior its existence, though
not one oi the uninher could pi-opcily
oversee a home, Here the ‘hop' oi the
‘irat' house and ilic society lady’s ‘aft
ternoon' are attempted, with the cx~
penditurc to he covered by sac iiiting
some ordinary propriety oi househeep
ing. Not yet does the American iatlr

cial impartially; the ‘Wolllau's cell-
tury' will he iar advanced heiore [tithe
ers and hushands cease putting the
question regarding the ten cents or

Housing is Pl'ablcm.

“Not until the question or residence
has been much more wisely considered
than hitherto will coeducation hare
received a iuir trial. State \mlyersl»
ties should provide houses lor women
students, where nice personal liauits
and graces or social liic can lie ioster
ed, and women at culture and social
position should pro 'dc orer these, Al.
Oxford and Canihiidgc, the halls ior
women are in the care oi ladies oi
very high connections in the social, p07
ii cal and literarv world. it does not
answer the question to ear that a state
government cannot aiiord such expon-
diture; as soon as iathcrs and mothers
demand it, the appropriations will bl-
fol'Lllconlill . The creation oi the ob
iice oi dean oi women is a licginuing
oi the needed rciorm, though pr
has sometimes accorded scant courlesv
to women's dcans. Pr idcnt Van lli r
oi the Unive sity oi Wisconsin has ex
pressed the ish that the young woman
in coeducational collegcs might hoi-iow
an independent social hie irom the
colleges ioi- women alone. Willi proper

The Woman's College.

In the concluding paragraph the
writer discusses the educational and
social aspects oi the woman's dollars
which, without a stronger resistance
than at present, will change into a
new sort oi iinislilng school.

”However. the social life oi the “'omc
an's college is not altogether periect.
That such an institution is the heel
place ior many girls is true. Never
theless a close examination oi the
'college life’ there shows too great a
leaning to the boarding school, The
social side oi the Woman’s college is
threatening to overshadow the cancer

Perhaps the most aotahie speaker ot
