According to the plans advanced at
the Commercial Club meeting an Tues
day evening by the board or athletic
control ot the college and taken under
consideration by the business men or
the city, Grinnell is likely to be the
scene or a ﬁeld meet or statewide in
terest this spring. The idea or the
board. as explained by C. E. Fisher at
the meeting Tuesday evening, is to
originate a meet which shall talre the
place or the state iield meet held in
Des Moines tor the past twenty years.
which passed into history when the
old Iowa intercollegiate Athletic ris-
socintion disbanded a tew months ago
The passing oi the state meet was
caused by the appearance on the ath
ietic horizon of the Missouri Valley
meet. which is to be held in Des
Moines this spring and in which Amos.
Iowa university and Dralre university
will compete. Grinnell will also, with-
out doubt, he invited to send a team,

As the situation now stands. how
ever, there is no neid meet in the state
ot town this year to which all the
colleges in the state are freely invited
to send teams, Such a meet it is Grin
nell's intention to otter it the nroieci
can be assured oi the support or the
business men.

Mr. Fisher pointed out that Crinnell
has the best track in the state and will
have suitable seating capacity to ban
die an enormous crowd by the time the
meet would be held, He stated that
the plan or the board or athletic con
trol is to invite teams from all rhe
colleges in the state, even including
those which are now members or the
hiissouri Valley conierence. He sta
ted that it was entirely likely that
Drake would send a team. ’The plan
would be to pay the railroad tare and
hotel expenses of each athlete winning
a point at the meet, to put up a suit-
able trophy to be carried oil by the
winning team and to provide medals
ior the winners oi places. The time
thought at, but not dennitely ﬁxed is
May 21, the Saturday preceding the
Missouri Valley meet in Des Monies
The expense or the meet, it is estima
ted. would be about 3750. or this
amount, the board or athletic control
would agree to assume the ﬁrst $350,
should there be a. deﬁcit The request
made or the business men is to sign up

signed by the recent short course, to
cover the remaining 5400.
