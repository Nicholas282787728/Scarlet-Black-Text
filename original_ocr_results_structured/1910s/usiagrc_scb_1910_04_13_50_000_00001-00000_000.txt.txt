Although the colleges oi the country
are in the midst or another athletic
the question ot tootball
tinnes to he npperniost in the student
mind as viewed rrom the publications
that come to the Scarlet and Blarn
aﬁce. A! the present time the greatest
interest a centered in the Zulu)“ ot
the uuive 'tics iiialting up the Mi

ago, only hr- a very narrow margin,
was the uuestiou or plan ing the game
at the universitr at Kansas ltept open.
The ﬁrst vote oi the regents laclted one

the calling or a contei-ence oi the pres

the game should he plat-ed next tall.

Two univer 'ly presidents in the (‘onr

At Kansas Coach Kennedy has as»
cided to devote the spring work in
iootball to teaching the men the Rugby
game. He believes that the training

will put Kansas in a position to mail»

Mme, Schuiiinnn-Hoinlt gave her long
nu 'tcd conceit Tuesday evening be-
fore a capacit house in Herrick
Chapel. To those who heard Novtllca
a year ago it gave an opportunity of
comparing at close range tuo stars of
the ﬁrst magnitude, to the new people
it was perhaps the ﬁrst glimpse or a
great prinia tlonna, while [or even“
one it was a source oi real pleasure
and inspiration.

In Mme, Nordica we had an Amer!-
can singer \ ho has licconie European-
ized, while Scliuiiiaiin-Heink is an
Americanized European The two
singers contrast themselves in almost
every respect. Nordltu in her sur-
roundings, her mannerisms, and her
program was characterized by all the
eclat and operatic aplomh, that {'59
heart of the most fastidious could do-
sire. SchnmannHeinlt is so unosten-
tatlous and so kindly in her attitude
toward her listeners, that one feels
almost as though he were on familiar
terms with her. In her songs she
combines n wonderful voice nith the
simplicity and graciousness which go
to make the truly great artist.

The program, opening with three
splendid operatic arias and closing
happily in a group at English songs.
seemed well chosen both as a means
of axplessing the singer's art and of
grati ying the various tastes of the
audience. or the operatic songs the
arie from “Samson and Deli iah” was
me most pleasing. 1t \\ as a i'umillar
number and was beautifully interpret-
ed. The rendering of “But the Lord Is
)liiidlill," from "St. Paul,” with organ
accompaniment was appropriate and
et'lective,

In the German group the first num-
liei- "Die Alliiiacht," h; Schubert, was
lltilily still; and approached the sub
time, The elltllore to this gl'oul), “Del"
Loiiz, li,\ Hrldacli, has a universal
