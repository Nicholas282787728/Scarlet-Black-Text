With an annuity gitt of $100,000 in
night tor the specitic purpose, plans
are being rapidly iormulated to build,
possibly during the coming summcr,
two or three cottages, accommodating
about one hundred men, which shall
eventually form a part of a‘Men's
Quadrangle, houslllg all the men or
the College. These cottages will be
built on Park street, between Eighth
and Tenth avenues. .

A gift oi a lot in the heart or Kansas
city, rained at instance. was made to
the College Monday by Dr. and Mrs,
Lehoy Dibble oi that city, and has
been accepted on the annuity plan.
The annual payment to the donors is
considered absurdly small in view at
the value oi the gitt. The deed is to
he ti-ansterred at once. Mrs. Dibble
graduated irom Grinuell in 1867. it
is possible that this gift may be used
ior erecting the men’s dormitories. but
no detiuite provision has yet been
made.

Addition will Be Great Advantage.

in his report tor the year ending
September, 1915, just trom the press,
President Main emphasizes the need
tor a Men’s Quadrangle and outlines
a plan tor llst gradual growth. He
says of the proposed cottages: “These
halls should be so managed, under a
man ot co-operation between the stu-
dents and faculty. that in them would
be set a. standard ot wholesome and
agreeable community living. The rich-
ness of our student lite, under such
conditions as might he secured, would
be greatly increased and would Im-
questionably iniluence tor good the lite
oi the entire college community."

President Main says that the 'pro-
miacuous scattering of the men in
houses throughout the town, while it
is not entirely unohjectionablc in it-
nelt, nevertheless has in it possibili-
ties that may, it permitted to go un-
noticed, world injury in time to the
spirit of democracy and social equal~
ity on which we pride ourselves. Ell
torts will be made to make the life of
the men in the new cottages as con-
genial and home- die as possihlc: to
conserve the best things about tra-
ternity life, while doing away with the
close organization of a. fraternity and
making tor democracy.

Tuo Cottages at First.

The completed Quadrangle will be
the result or a gradual growth, begin-
ning with two or three cottages and
coming to a climax with the erection of
a central building which shall be
known as the Grl'nnell Union. or the
Men’s Union. In the first two or three
cottages, temporary provision will
probably be made ior- dining room ca-
paci ', not only lcr those living in
them, but tor tuo or even three times
that number. it would be so arranged
that this capacity could be readily iii-
creased at any time, thus Drmldlng

it is not the plan or the admin tra-
tion to make these resitential

courts. and many other tenturcs. No
lestimates as to the probable cost or
the building have been made, The
present Men's Gymnasium will be en-
largcd to nearly double its capacity,
and will be used as an auditorium.
