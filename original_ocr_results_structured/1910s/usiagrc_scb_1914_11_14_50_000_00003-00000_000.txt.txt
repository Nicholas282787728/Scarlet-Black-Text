“MY BEST GIRL."

Out: oi the cleanest, snappiest musi-
cal comedy attractions ever seen in
Grinuell is “My Best Girl", which was
adequately represented at The Colonial
last evening by Victor niorley and a
competent company. One or the larg-
est audiences at the season witnessed
the periorntouce and evidenced its ap-
preciation hy lilieral applause,

“My Best Girl" is blessed with more
or a plot than otten tails to the lot or
musical comedies and also with a mun-
bel' ot tunct'ul (titties. it \\ as especi-

The play is equipped with an excel-
