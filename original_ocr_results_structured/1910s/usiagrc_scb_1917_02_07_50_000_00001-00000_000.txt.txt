"The reason that some people are
starving in America is that other peo-
ple are making money out of it,” as-
serted Professor George Albert Coe, in
the Gates Memorial Lecture, which
Tuesday morning opened the filth an-
nual Fellowship Conference.

“It is a fact that we have assumed
that we are to be brotherly and neighe
hcrly," continued Professor Coe, “but
we have allowed to exist a social order
which defeats this end. We are a part
of a system which makes it possible
for our brother-s to go hungry."

This lecture was scheduled to have
been given Monday morning, but her

was impossible for Professor Coe to

disability of the railroads, and general

the management, greatly depleted the

yesterday. In the morning the state
Conference committee meetings were

For the first time this year Vesper
service was omitted last Sunday. A
storm lasting the greater part of the
day made it impossible to heat the
Chapel building, causing Vesper choir
practice and the usual Vesper service
to be omitted. No difficulty was ex—
perienced in keeping ‘tho Quadrangle
warm, but it was found impossible to
heat the Chapel adequately.

A temperature of eight to twelve dce
grees below zero, according to govern-
incut reports, was made still worse by
a high northwest wind which contllle
ned throughout the day. The storm,
said by railroad men to have been the
worst in twenIYviiVe years, raged over
the greater part of Iowa. Nebraska,
Missouri, and the Dakotas during the
day, delaying trains from one to twelve
hours.

up wretchcdly by the number of fouls
and held balls which were called by
Referee Hedges. Amos trimmed Grin»
noll here yesterday afternoon 18-8.
Ten fouls were called on Grrniiell, and.
eleven on Ames, eight in each case be-
ing classed as personal. Swan has the
unique record of being the only man
who played the entire game without
being fouled once, while Morgan was
the only one of the Ames five who
didn't receive a personal. Hedges‘ len-
iency in those two cares - unaccount—

The team who put up the best game
won, although it cannot he denied that
Grinnell put up a far inferior game in
what they have been playing. The
scarlet and black had a number of
hard luck shots, and also threw a num-
ber ol shots away on wild trie Ames
played a short passing game, and got
away with it. Their guarding was air-—
tight, most of Grinnell’s shots being’
from mid—floor.

Morgan led Ames' offensive work
wrth three baskets, while Erskin's at
center landed 'two and blew about
three easy ones. Nori - and Swan
bottled up the AJnes’ forwards effect—
ually. but one goal being registered
against them. But, as has been said
before, Hedges’ work was probably
the feature or the contest.

“The issue is," insisted Professor-
009, “Whether or not We shall have a
permanent social stratification in the
United states; whether or not we want
a permanent servile class in this coune
try."

“Remedial legislation is fighting its

way inch by inch, because the whole
system is based on a balance of selfish
interests,” he declared. "We are gets
ting‘ oppression under the more form
of popular government."

“There is the some trouble with Safe
mons; they are addressed to the adult
who cannot change. his selfish prer
suppositions of society," continued Mr.
Coe, "and we must educate the child
to another view, in order to reeone
struet this condition of society.”

Professor Coe pointed out how the
social system constantly whispered to
the child, “Grab your share," and he
explained, "He is only grabbing all
that he can and calling it his share."

In his lecture, “The Outlook of
American Protestanti m,” delivered
last night to the conference, Dl', Hue
hert c. Herring declared that the
church must keep step with the mode
crn sp it of democracy and science,
or it will “go out of busine "

"If there is a cause for this singu-
larly causeless war," he said, “it is
the paganism which is so thoroughly
at the basis of European churches that
makes it impossible for them to ruin»

There is no war correspondent at
the present time who has had the wide
experience in this kind of work that
Mr. Palmer has enjoyed. He was first
on duty in the Klondike and in the
Philippines in 1397 and 1898. He made
he trip around the world with Admiral
Dewey in 1399 and spent the next year-
in the Philippines and with the Amen
ican rcliel expedition which was sent
to poking, china. In 1903 he was an»
gaged in con ~pondence work in the
Central American and Macedonian me
surrcctions. In 1504 he was with the
first Japanese army in the field, where
he remained until the close of the

Lile'cs which receive the electric vi-
brations in the air stretch lrom the
top of Goodllow hall to the top of Chi-
cago hall. These wires are connected
with the receiving table in the physics
office.

While the local station has not yet
been fitted up to send messages, a
number of distant places are heard
regularly. The time is sent out Irom
Arlington at ii in the morning and
u at night, and is easily heard here.
lLast night the writcr also heard calls
from Indianapolis and Chicago, and
many others were in the air.

While the physics department con»
structed the outfit for experimental
purposes largely, it will have many
>practical valucs. Next lall Grillnall
will be able to get the football results
instantly as they are sent out by the
stations at Iowa City, Ames, Lincoln,
and other nearby university centers.
Gl'lmlell can also send out scores in
the same way, and they will be picked
up at these other stations.

Arlington is the point at greatest
distance which is now heard distinct»
ly, but the G innell station will be en-
larged later so that it can hear the
war ships on the seas, and even Euro-
pean si'tinns.

With each team presenting a crip-

their list of victories last Saturday
night by drubbing the strong Drake
team, 37-21.

up a good game, the play ior the most
part being much faster than the large
score would indicate. Pew personal
fouls were called, and the spirit shown
by the Drake men was thc best scen

playing was .elean, and thc crowd was
with them from the start because of
their good sportsmanship.
