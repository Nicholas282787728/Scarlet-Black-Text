Building, Two Wallops Five 9-8
In Opening Game of Dorm League

By Our Women’s Sports Writer.

Last night Ward Field witnessed one
of the most interesting trock meets in
the history of Grinncll athletics. The
girls at the Quadrangle decided that
the men ought not to csriy off on the
honors of the track season, and there-
fore out on a home meet of their own.

At cigbt-torty-live the crowd assem-
bled, and at nine the ﬁrst event was
run off. This was the lZU-yard dash
and was won by Eleanor Horris, '21,
with Ruth Gingles, '19, a close second.

The third of a mile was won by
Adelaide Sibley, who had a. good mar»
gin over Edith st. John, who came in
second. .

Seniors were tbs only ones who on-
tered the broad lump. Margery Frlnk
won xrst

Too high jump was one of the most

. interesting evenm of the evening, and
received much hearty applause from
the audience. A large number or con-

’testztnts entered for the high jump, of
whom Agnes St. John won ﬁrst place,
Margery Frink second, and Margaret
VVitllztcc third.

The relay was won by the Seniors
with the Sophomores a close second.

The lateness of the hour prevented
the teams from participating in the
other cvents, which were accordingly
liostponed until somc later date. The
girls are on most enthusiastic about
tho meet and plan to hcvc another
one, with more elabornto preparation
in the near future.

passed out three trips to ﬁrst.

crossed the pan before he settled
down and struck out Bandy. Dichl re-

no erlol’ resulting in two runs and a

be the Winning run. Five lost a
chance of tlcing it up when Briggs
