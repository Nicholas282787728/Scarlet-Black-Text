The peculiar and twisted conception
which may be readily gained from
newspaper stories, even though prop-
any written, is shown in the following
editorial comment from the current
issue of the Drake Dclphie:

“Because 'lllke’ Augustlne, Cele»
bratéd tontliall, basketball, baseball and
track star, has left school, Grinnell
athletic experts are saying that their
sports piospects for the ieinaindei- ot
the year have gone up in smoke, or,
collapsed, according to the parti lai-
style of slang pretericd by the wiiter

of the news,

“It is to he hoped that Gl'innell's
atlileti s are not so hopelessly cen-
tialitetl about a tew students as the
iepoit would seem to indicate. College
training along physical lines should
not be limited to n tew eniieits, lint
should include as many students as
possible," t

To us it seems that our Delplnc‘
trieiids have taken an unthinking and
narrow view. It a newspaper story
about a his athlete gives the idea that'
he constitutes the whole athletic oi l
galllzatlon or the institution, then we
cooltl say the same about Drake A
stoiy recently appealed in the darlics,‘
to the ettcct that llowaitl Drew, Drake1
tinck ll"un(lel had injuied his hack and
could not go east to participate in‘
scveial iiidooi nieets. Last spring the
newspapers were lull of stories about:
"Red" Shearer, also one of Drake's‘
track marvels Ii we were to followl
out the Deloh line or thought we,
should have to conclude that these twol
nieu make up the whole or the athletic!
system at Drake. But we know dit-‘
lerent, and we are not going to nar-‘
row ourselves down so much as to sayl
that ‘

he know that friend Schultz is a
good debatcr and usually knows his
facts before he . ar arguing, but in
this case his editorial comment can-
not he supported. It is true that An-
gnstine was a tower of strength in'
Gl'innell athletics. Yet however pie
cions and close to the hearts of Grill»
nellians he has been. the recent Carle-
ton gamc, in which the Nortlicrners
stiller-ed their lost defeat in three
year and the in ten their home tloor
in . i, is but one hit at evidence to
show that there are other playing

, patients

sisting that all printed cummunlcar
‘llons be signed unless it is desired

basketball in Gimncll besides "lithe.“i

Last Saturday’s game in which the
Iowans were held to a 19 to iii score is
another instance. No, Gi-innell does
not allow her athletics to center in
one man.

(illlh’ mil. PRIDE.

\l hy is it that the city oi Gl'lllnell
hasnt a detention hospital or some
sinnlar provision tor the isolation or
with contagious diseases}
The present scarlet fever and small—
pox situation is but another one or a
number of instances during ttic last
tcw years which have shown a tie-
mendons iiced tor one. The absence or
a detention hospital would test the
pride or any city.

Over in Oberlin, editor llai-vm niust
have been having a lot at trouble with
“crabbers.” In the last issue of the
chemo Revrew he reprints for their
benefit one of our recent stories of a
chapel tall: by President llam in which
he quoted from letters written by
alumni who said that their tendency
to "crab” during student days was
largely due to what one was pleased
to call his "lack at size."

The "Colonel" agrees with us in in-

that the signature he omitted. He is»
lei-ins us that he is not “Kernel Left,"
whose name has appeared recently.

Our friends, The Daily Iowan, seem
to be struggling for existence with
their books showings derieit "l the
neighborhood of 3500,00. Their task
in getting “out of the hole" does not
seem to be an easy one.

No sooner has Ross Crane departed
from Grinnell than we note that he
will reappear in Iowa sooil to conduct
another art exhibit similar to the re-
cent one here. This time he will be in
Anies in February.

N0 FOUNDATION TO THE
RUMOR 0F IlillLLLNE MEET

The rumor which has been current
during the past week that Grinnell
will stage a track meet with Hamllne
college next spring has absolutely no
foundation, according to a statement
by “Doc" lluif, track coach. The 'l‘u-
inor was caused by a story appearing
in _the “Oracle,” the student publica-
tion of that place.

"Our schedule calls for no meet with
Hamline, and the matter has never
been mentioned to me," said Huff,
"When we schedule any out-of—ther
state meets, s either with some “115*
onri valley heel or with some team
union will iank with them Hamline
has a good tiaclt team, blit we have
not scheduled any meet with them l‘
