"Our Present Dity Attitude Te-i
Ward Jesus" Is Discussed.

"We oi the present day do not look
upon Jesus in the right light when}
the name Jesus Christ is ineiitionedl
we genernily associate it with u huin-
ble, despised man or with monasteries
churches, liynius rtnd the like," s. d
President Hill“ at the r. ii. meeting
Thin-stay erening.

“Jasils represents all ot the qualities
which appeal to a young ninn as youth,
strength and courage, was pointed
out in- the President Although gen»
crally looked upon and thought or as
an old inan, Christ was put llllrtj'rthlee

cars of age when He died, and had
ucl cred His goul early in life.

'l'heaquiility oi strength is ndiuiicd

the temple showed that lie was not
lurking in courage, either. Coinhinod
n h this rpinli V- was thil or under-
ness, 7L cenihinaticu which today is
only round in great men."

in conclusion President Main culled
the attention ot the audience to the
tact that most of us had the impres-
sion that Christ represented religionl
alone, but on the contrary, a study or
the New Testament would show that
Jesus never mentioned religion, but
dealt with life.
