NORTHWESTERN GAME OFF

The Nehrasha \reslcyan basketball
game, scheduled tor February a. has
heen cancelled, owing to the tact that
games had already heen scheduled tor
the preceding Friday and Saturday, and
it was thought that the long trip, iii
addition to the other two games away
from home, would he too ardtrotis tor
an inexperienced squad. The games
with Autos and Drake will he played
on February 6 aitd 7, as scheduled, and
the ilehraslta Wesleyan game at Grin-
iiell trill also he played.

It is probable that a game with tlte
Haskell Indians it ill he Z'H‘l'ilugetl to
fill out the schedule Director Hutt'
received a communication train the
manager or the Haskell tciiiii uttering

Grinnell schedule. Negotiations hate

en. ely pi-ohhhle that the gnnie will
be scheduled.

Eastern thllms Oif.

Negotiations with Northwestern niid
Beloit have tailed to ar a lit any
agreement, and it is probable that the
plan to play these two teams will he
nhnndoued, it was impossible to se-
cure dates with both teams close
enough together to illﬂke the playing
or the two games in one t 'p pract
enlile. As this was the only condition
under which Griiinell could schedule
these games it appear. that the, Scat»
let and Black till! be compelled to
forage the chance to meet the Eastern
teams during the present season.
