than Grinncll has ever OIlel‘etl,vlllt\l
is the extent oi the' opportunities to
leate Grinnell that hate come to
President llain (luring the last spring

"I helieie too ﬁl'lnl} iii the iuttit-e ot
Grinncll, and l have too llldny deepr
rooted relationships here", was the
reason Expressed hi- Pre dent .\lain
tor deciding to remain here,

The ot't’er ot the University of the

attr cttt-e, since it included a salary
ot‘ $1 .000 and required no ﬁnancial
responsibility from its head, a thing
that weighs so licav y on the slloulr
