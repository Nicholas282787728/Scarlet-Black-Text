Colorado, Beloit alld Knox, will each
send‘a man to Harvard during thc
next semester and the latter in turn
sends a processor to spend one-fourth
of the semester at each ol these places.

Professor Nol' s will assume the
duties ol an assi ant pl-otessor or his
structor at Cambridge which
mean admittance to [acuity meetings
and thereby a closer acquaintance witir
Harvard professors. As Mr, Nol'l‘ls'

"Team play" tells the story ot the

the game, the iowans were kept in
the dclensive by Gl‘illllell's dazzling cx<

did ilot story up even when the team

ot the game. captain Tharp scored
