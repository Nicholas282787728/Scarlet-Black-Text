Grace Scary Appears in .Exeep.
tional Graduation Program.

Miss Grace soar-y aupcnrcd in a
violin rrcititl last evening which
‘provcd to he one or the most pleasing
that has hccn givru in Grinncll this
year, hariuig not even those oi the
professional artists.
| Her program, which was given he
tore a large audience, was most novel
in selection or numbers, and the Miss
Scary did not see ﬁt to give on—
corcs, her hearers wont away enthusi-
astic over her Work. Mrs. Alma Ful-
lcr Pierce, her accompanist at the
piano, deserves great credit for her
thoughtful interpretation or her part.

The program was opened with a
Handel sonata ior violin and piano,
which was given in a manner to do
:crcdit to any artist. Tile two Beetho—
vcu numbers, the Romance in c, and
the Mcnllott in G, were both cxccls
lcutly played. In the “Romance" her
harmony was snlcndid, and her tone
work was osnccially pure and clear.

The teatnre or her playing thruont
was her c llisite tone quality and the
feeling: winch she not into her inter»
Di'elatlon of the pieces, even more than
her apparently laultlcss technique.

Her program was concluded alter
three numbers [mm the choriot Bal-

let scone.
