examinations and sanitary inspection.
To pay for these services each student
will be charged a tee of $1.

The semester tee has provided for

found:

“The human cells scraped from the

the head oi a pin could not he placed

these bits of skin. The saliva, by run-

mated that the cup contained over 20,-

As many as 150 germs were seen clingr
ing to a single cell, and very low cells
showed less than lll germs. Betueen
the cells were thousands of germs, left

by the drinkers. Not less than one
