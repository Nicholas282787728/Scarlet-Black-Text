lwu THE WAR! L

MILITARY DAY

No Grlmlell man or woman could at-
tend a chapel service likc the one
yesterday morning without becoming
a better Griiiuelliair. Tlic patriotic
music, the impressive nag-raising ser-
vice, and the talks by president llain.
Protessor Lorin, and Lieutenant Applce
by, helped one to realize the things
this college stands for, and the place it
has in national life.

The openrllousc at the men’s (1011an

,tories iii the afternoon “as a sort oi
intorinal dedication oi that splendid

group of buildings which is the ﬁrst‘

step in the program of making Grin-
iioll “the ﬁnest equipped merrs college
in the United States."

The c pcratien ot the local Elks
in presenting “The Pirates ct Pei-re
zaricc" at the Colonial in the evening
showed the desire oi Gilllllcll business
and proicssional men to do their \llr
most to help the college and the calr
lege students. it was an erpr ion
oi the admirable spirit or cooperation
existing bctwecn town and college.
The ldllrs put on an excellent show,
and the entire proceeds hour it will be
used ior the unitorin fund.

will speak at the Congregational
clurrch Saturday evening.

Maseﬁeld has given a new meaning
to poetry. His work appeals to men
who do not care in what they ordi—
narily have considered as poetry,

The coming or such a man to Grin-
neel is a notable event.

In answer to the question, "What do
you think or the proposed honor sor
cietr ior senior women?“ my response
is enthusiastic. i believe that a
group oi women who have been chosen
because they have attained high stand
ards oi scholarship and at the same’
time have realized the importance ob
tine community living, may wield an‘
ci’el'rlllcl'easing inﬂuence in college
lite.

While combining somewhat the rc-
ouirements tor Phi Beta Kappa and
the Kennedy Service prize, the mem-
bers oi this organization wil have the
:trltlltimlal horror- and opportunity at an
entire year in which to serve their cole
lege, The) will have already prorcn
their ability to COrDllel'ate in the best
college movements without loss of
scholastic standing, and with the some
splendid spirit at loyalty and helptul-
ncss which characterized their earlier
elicits they will be able to work thrri
their organization for a better and
more unnersal inliillincrit oi Gvirinoll

As soon as anything was said about
a senior honor society for Grinneli
girls, up sprang the conscientious obv
jcctors. ‘.ust third: of that!" they
say “what will become of us and our
much-touted democracy?" All this
without stopping to consider just whatl
they oppose. Far as thi. sccrcty has
been planned, it is to mean the choos-
ing or girls who have shown them—
selves wo liy of being honored; have
in tact shown themselves worthy, in
every sense or the word, to be called
real Gririiicll girls.

When you were a freshman, \l‘Ollldr
ri't you have lilicd to know a group or
girls about whom to build your ideals

A darling little miss wrote us a must

so long that we’d had to run a couple
or -tra pages to have it in, and the

lrelorc, and got mad because it didn't
get in, so we’re going to print a hit oi
