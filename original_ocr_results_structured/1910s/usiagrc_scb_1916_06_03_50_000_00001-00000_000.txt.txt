Rapidly rising in fame as an auth-

telling of his experience as an English.

Committees Decide Contest To
Take Place Next Satur-
day Morning.

.l new plan of Judging IS to be used
in the Hill Speaking Contests ncxt
Saturday morning. This will (cud to
make these popular contests duo of
the most interesting features of Coin-
mencement week. The plan maltes it
possible for a large number oi the
audience to participate in the judg-
ing.

The new plan combines all the ad-
vantagcs of the old. with the added
feature of having a large number 'of
people act as judges. It will tend tar
ward better speaking. as the Contests
ants must appeal to the whole andk
ence rather than to a small group, it
is more democratic, and will make
general effectiveness sought above eye
erything else.
