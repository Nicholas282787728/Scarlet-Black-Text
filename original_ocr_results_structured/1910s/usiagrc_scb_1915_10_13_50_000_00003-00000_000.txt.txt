We Are Glad to Show You The New Dresses

In all the new wool and silk fabrics. Fashion has decreed the normal
waist line again, but a. few styles still retain the low or slightly raised
waist. A. close»[ittlng llip is noticeable in most all models. waists
are now as loose as in past season, yet they cannot be fitted too tighb"
ly. Set-in sleeves of full length are most used.

YOU’LL FIND US GLAL TO SHOW YOU.
