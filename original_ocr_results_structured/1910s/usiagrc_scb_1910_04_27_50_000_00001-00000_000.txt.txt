JUSTICE lil-J’l'T/Ilc' 'I'HlV 'rlu'i'
OF AMERICA.

The Right iiollolnble ,iarllcs Bryce.
Ambassador or Great Britain to the
United States, gave his special lecture
on ‘ 'nglisll Experience ill Judicial and
Legislative Methods," ill the Congrega-
tional church inst evening. This ad
dress was prepared and delivered ill
Grinnell by the special request or Pro»
fessol' Macy.

In a general war a number ot iilLei'r
csting features or tile English judicial
and le ' alive methods were suggested
which might very advantageously he
transferred to American institiitiolls.

Ambassador hl-yce's lecture was a
comparison at the developments in the
English and American colistitutions
since the beginning of their divergence
in 1789. There were tllree causes lol-
the divergence; in the ﬁrst place the
United States had a number of Separate
unities which it was desired to bring
together, while England had not this
problem; second, there was the desire
to avoid the supposed evils or the
English system, such as the great
Power oi the Crown; tllird, Americans
did not understand the British constir
tutiou, and hence constructed ours on
principles which did not exist.

There are certain diirerences Der
tween the English and American legis-
lative and executive relations. in Eng'
land the legislative and executive have
been drawn more closely together,
while in the United States they have
remained entirely separate and distinct
departments. The English executive
does not have the power to veto which
belongs to the American plan. The
United state: constitution reserves to
the people certain tunctions which can
only be modiﬁed by popular vote, while
the English constitution can be amend
ed by the election or a certain class or
legislators. The divergences which
have developed in the English and
American constitutions sllow that instir
tiltions have capacities for development
which coirld lrct have been t‘oreseell
by the toundei-s. The judicial er tom
shows certain diiierellces ill regard to
both juries and judge The Amer
cans brought the ini-y system uitll
them irom England but ill the United
states it s d cult to setlll'e jui-
while in England it is easy. England
has a means or sccirrirlg juries or more

opinion that ii iii - oi scven would he

vices 0f the year occurred this mornw
mg, when the spcnhcr oi tile occasion
w s the ltighi Honorable James Bryce,
Ambassador tram Great Britain. After
"Sons at Old Grinnell" was sung with
enthusiasm by the large audience,
President Main presented Ambassador
Bryce, who spoke on Gladstone, one oi
oi his i'ol-mer triellds.

Mr, 1er ce spent most of his time in
dismissing the characteristic traits of
Mr. Gladstone \i‘hitll r ~nlted iron: his
thorough college and ulriversity train,
illg. Gladstone was educated at Eaton
college and then at extol-d, studying
the ancient classics and mathematics
almost eyclnslvely. He mastered
Greek and Latin as well as the modern
languages, such as French and ltaliau.
which he spoke with great ease and ﬂu-
eucy,

He termed the habit and the passion
tor reading, and did an immense
amount or it all through his long lite.
He also did considerable writing and
some of historical sketches especially
are worthy or great commendation.

A tavorite study ot the ”grand old
man" was theology, and he never til-ed
ot discussing theological questions. His
favorite poet was Dante. He greatly
enioyed tnc ltalian language and wroto‘
occasional humorous verses in that
language. Ambassador Bryce took on,
casion to emphasize the tact that Mr,
Gladstone controlled a tremendous
amount of material in all ﬁelds 0!
knowledge touching human ieelings
and sympathies and was thereby ell.
allied to exercise great inﬂuence over
the emotions ot his hearers.

“nether great tact of importance was
his sense oi the moral side at all ones.
tions. Hrs theological studies made
him sure to see the higher phase at
everything and he“1i(ted mere political
wrallglillgs up into the higher and
purer ail of morality and conscience.“

aladstolle's “weaknesses" were his
hli'k DI llllouledgev of science mid his
tendency to “talk over the heads" ot
those with whom he (‘Iline ill contact.
lie was onen carried away by his eu-
(hllsiasm so that he became cloudy
in many, ”but," Said Mr Bryce, clear
or cloud). lie was alnn - interesting."
