Sports Editor Writes Optimistic
Estimate of Situation

BATTERY AND INFIELD GOOD

Olltﬁeld Positions Unsettledilvierl
Taking More Interets.

Although few signs oi spring are
eiidcut a small band oi the inltlrtul
are working out every (lay in the gym
naslum. Light workouts only are in-
dulged in, to work the atiitness out of
arms long in willtel' quarters.

The pitchlng stair will be stronger
this spring than it has been slnce Jar-
nagln and Smithson did such brilliant
work in 1909. The veteran Ficken will
co the mainstay ot the battery but
Anderson will be equally dependd‘
Both men are ﬁnished players and wlll
probably also alternate in one oi the
inﬁeld positions. Cozzens has held
down a box position tor the past two
seasons but wlll probably play in the
outﬁeld as be will not be needed in
the box very much.

Catcher Uncertain.

The receiving end at the battery is
causing no end oi trouble. Frey. Suth-
erland, Greenwood and Keniston are
all candidates for-the position. Greenr
wood is new to the place but if a:
shows class he may stay there. slith-
erland has the best wing but is needell
badly on third base which is his regu-
lar position, Kenlston is a hardy player
but lacks the wing. He will probably
be an outﬁeld candidate.

ilcCreatli held down the initial sack
last year and with the added experi-
ence should make a good man, C
Macy was doped to give him a battle
for the place but has not as yet put In
an appearance.

Inﬁeld Looks Good

Ulich, hicMuri-ay and H. Macy are Inr
ﬁeld candidates who look good lol‘ me
learn. Ulich should make a good man
as he is a clean ﬁelder and a hard
hitter. Anderson and Ficken will
probably play one position when not
lo the box.

The outﬁeld is noL settled although a
number or good men are sceklng
berths. H. J Carney and Cozzens are
veteran ﬁelders, and should make a
place. Keniston and Cliar-leton are
showing up good in preliminary prilc»
tico. Luce is also out for a place and
with his experience should give some
man a run for- a place,

Kir-tley. Brinton, Watt, Farivell,
Breed and Heidt are men who are new
to the game but are reporting ior prac
tice. it is impossible as yet to see
what kind or a showing the new men
will make.

LAST EVENING TALK 6001]

Professor Hart Describes Philip-
pines Last Thursday Night.

PRAISES AMERICAN GOV’T,

Says Climate Is Against Coloniza-
tion from United States.

in his lecture on the Philippines last
Thursday evcnlng, the last oi his illus-
trated tallis, Professor Hart greatly
interested a. small but appreciative ans
dience.

In his romarhs previous to the shouu
ing or the vleus, Pr-olessor Hart gave
brieﬂy the history oi the Philippines
from their discovery and colonization
by Spain to the present time, dwelling
particularly on the period under Amer
ican rule. In connection with this he
said that the Philippines were the best
governed territory undcr the American
ﬂag but that the natives had an ar-
dent desire to be free, and refused to
be thankful ior their good government.
These islands, he said, will never her
come a permanent ironic for Americans
because ol the climate, which few
white people from the north tcniperace
zone can endure for very long.

Touching upon the reasons actuating
the taking over of the islands alter the
war with Spain, Mr. Hui-t said he had
been told by the seci-ctary ot the Peace
Commission that they had been taken
because there was nothing else to do,
ior Spain was not strong enough lo
control them, and Germany would
have probably oLcupicd Lllem if an;
attempt had been iii-ado to set them
free.

The natural resources on the Phi!-

ippines are cllorlllolls but \el'y diitir-ult'

to get at, and as the government is
practicing conservation, it is probable
that it uill lie solllstime before th »\
are exhausted. The v' ws “ere rn

Excels in Tone and Expression.

The G by Glee Club sang their ﬁith
annual concert in Herrick Chapel last:
night, and took the large audience by
storm with their brillllant and ﬁnlelr
ed rendering of one or the most uni~
iormly beautltul programs which has
been. heard in Grinnell tor. several
years,

The girls scored their ﬁrst favomblu
impression as soon as they appeared.
The idea or a uniform appearance is
a good one, and the simple but pretty.
gowns, all alike, produced an excite
site effect.

The ‘concel‘t opened with Dvorak’s
“Songs My Mother Taught Me.” Thls

from a purely musical standpoint, on
the entire program. After singing
ilrs. Beach's brilliant setting or:
Browning's exquisite lyric, “The Year's
at the Spring," the club sang a Bar—
cnrollo by ottenbach as an encore.

iliss Vera Attwuoll, favorite lyric
soprano. sang an aria lrorn Weber's
opera, “Der irreischutz." This is one
ot the standard operas, and the aria.
Miss Attrvooll sang is tremendously
dillirnlt, as well as brilliant, but she
rendered it in her usual confident and
ellecliie wa,. Miss Aitwooll has de~
vcloped steadily and rapidly in the
vocal art since she has been in Grin-
null and her place in our musical circle
will he ban-d to ﬁll when she graduates.
As an encore she sang the last part or
the a a again.

Alter the next group, composed 0'!
Cadman's “From the Land of Skyblue

Mrs. H. H, A. Beach, the club sang
