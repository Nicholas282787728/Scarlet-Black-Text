HELLO!

The Freshmen who are enviously
watching the wild greetings of the
apperclassmen will be doing the
greeting next year with the same
enthusiasm, for the friendships
that Grinnell brings are its biggest
value, Meanwhile we extend to
the ﬁrst year students as warm a
welcome as we can express and at
the same time warn them that there
are bound to be days of lonesome-
ness and homesickness before the
non/Wears away. But as time goes

so Grinnell will grow to mean more

and more. and four years hence the
Freshman who wondered how he
would like it, will be entirely lost
in an “old grad” who is thrilled at
the sight of a picture of the cam-
pus. Old students and new stu-
dents!we’re mighty glad to see
you; may the year he a year of
friendships and the happiness that
friends and work can bring.

’ SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

It is too early to have any very
accurate notion about the prospects
for the eleven but the “fans” are
quite sanguine over the outlook.
Grinnell has never lost games be-
cause of a real lack of material; if
everyone answers Coach Brown's
call who should1 the wearersr of
the Scarlet and Black will have oc-
casion for several bonﬁres on Ward
Field, The success of the season
depends upon the men who “don't
hardly think they'll get out this
year” and upon the general inter-
est of the students. How much do
you know about who is out for the
team, what the new rules are. and
when the ﬁrst game is scheduled?
It’s time to begin to talk football!

Never borrow trouble; simply
buy your books in partnership.

mm

,

College is where one transfo
ambition into proﬁciency, careless.
ness into worthlessness, or poor
judgment into poor health

Rooters make a lot of racket but
it's the man who gets out for the
team that wins the games.

If you want a chance to rise, reg-
ister for an eight o’clock.

THE SCRAP.

The unfortunate occurrences in
connection with the class scrap of
last year should make both classes
exceedingly careful this year. The
scrap itself is one of the best feat-
ures of the year and its perpetua
tion depends upon the way in
which it is carried on this year.
The new rules will tend to elimi-
nate the danger that goes with in-
discriminate ﬁghting in the dark
and they will make the event more
enjoyable for the College as a
whole. a “I 11:4 ’
