MEN WANTED !

When some one from an over»,

n’annerl agricultural college makes
slurring‘ remarks about Gl‘ .nell
and calls it a “girls’ seminary”
We rise in righteous indignation

and are tempted to fall upon thel

isguided youth—and yet the reg-
Ltration ﬁgures show every year
that a large number of the boys
v he “were going to come“ go else-
where and always a number of
Freshmen drop out during the
year, The trouble is not that Grin-
nell lacks quality, but that other
"5 rake n‘cre strenuous ef—

foi to get the men, Every little
Iowa town is ﬂooded in the sum-
mer months with representatives
of different colleges, some of them,
indeed, descending into the realms
of professionalism in offering
scholarships and easy "jobs” to
high school athletes. vGrinnell cer-
tainly has no need of joining this
class, but two things would greatly
change the ﬁgures of the next reg-
istration: If some loyal alumnus
or friend of the College would
spend a few hundred dollars in
sending a man like Coach Huff to
see the high school graduates he
could certainly bring many good
men to Grinnell. Then, too, if the
present students would make all
the effort that they should the
number of men would grow. For
the present the ”Scarlet and
Black" will endeavor to see that
some attention is paid to prospec-
tive students if their names, so
labelled, are dropped in the “Copy
Box” in the Library lobby. We
must begin now, and we must not
conﬁne ourselves to the high school
athletes—who often fail to show
up; we want more of the every-day
all»around high school men who
make up the bone and sinew cf the
college community.

And as for those who drop out
‘during the yeariit is our fault,
The upperclussmen must take more
lime to become really acquainted
wi‘h the new students.

 

WHY ARE WE HERE?

In one of our English courses
We once discovered a statement by
Carlyle that the main object of ed-
ucation was the attainment of a
working philosophy of life. Cer-
tainly, then, Grinnell, in common
with every college, sends out many
who have not accomplished this
object. It is not a thing that the
College can hand out in capsules
but in these years when we are
ﬁrst feeling the joys of thinking
for ourselves it behooves us to take
time to think seriously about the
bigger things of life—certainly we
should spend a part of our Sun-
days in this way. We don‘t have
to be Weighed down by religion
and we must not mistake the ex-
celsior that comes in the box for
religion itself, but it looks worth
while to wonder why we are here.

 

The year has opened with better
spirit than at any time within the
memory of the present students.
It is going to be a better year than
any we have yet passed through7
‘and our attitude will make it so.
Let’s forget how to knock.

Bacon said somewhere: “Men
must know that in this theatre of
'rran’s Life it remainetb only to God
land angels to be lookers-on.”
,Evidently it's up to everybody but
the girls to get out for the foot-
ball team.

College life, like any other kind,
is just one thing after another.

Any old hog can root; it takes a
man to make the team.

bccuuse the space commonly used for

Such a meet will or course be of imr
mediate interest to all, because there
is enough talent in the three ubpcr
classes to assure some fast and hard-
lought races. But aside lrom this im-
mediate consideration, the meet should
arouse considerable enthusiasm because
at the fact that it will be a means
at determining to a certain extent the
