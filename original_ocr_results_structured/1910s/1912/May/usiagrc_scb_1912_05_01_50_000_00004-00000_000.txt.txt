Series to Start Next Saturday
With Prespects for a Close
Contest.

Practice tor the class baseball serics
is now on and each team is wot-hills
hard to annex the laurels. Theﬁas
son starts Saturday and will he con-
cludcd the iollowing weeir.

The call for ﬁrst place seems to rest
with the Juniors and Freshmen. The
sophs have a hotter chance than the
Seniors and may perhaps make a good
run ror ﬁrst place,

The Freshmen have Schwartz and
Brnnn as pitchers with the veteran
iicars as a hackstop. Bartlett will
likely hold down the initial sacli, with
the rest of the places somewhat in
the air. Captain Little, Severeide,
Tedrow, Weelns, Tharp and others nro
all out ior the team.

The Junior team will probably be
made up or Fleck, in the box, Eastman
to receive, and Capt. Charlton, Jacks
son, Sivan, Luce, Bryan, Browllell.
Stevenson, and whsclcr ior the rest
of the nine.

The second year iollis hare manl-
men out hut tow places very sure.
Frey will prohahly catch, \Valsu-ortn
and Ellis pitch Needhaul, Larsen,

tley, lros, Doudna, Richards and
Brody will ﬁll up the remaining posi.
tions

The “cup and gown” nine, which is
dopcd ior last place. are lmrd at
worl- under the able captaincy of
"Bill” Beyer, Slutz and litnlpin will
compose the tuirling start with inmda
hshiud the hat.
