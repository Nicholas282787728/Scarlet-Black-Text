SIMPSON EASILY
DEEEAIED YESIERDAY

ANDEIISOX PI TUHHS GIIEA 7
GAME AGAINST JIL‘TIIODIS’I

Game Played ill Rain on word Field——
Score 6 to j—cmkch Gets
Tlli'cc Hits.

Amid lreouent and copious corrtribrr
tions by Jupiter Fluvius, Grinnell succ
ceetlcd in deleating Simpson by the
comtortahle score or G to 1. Anderson
was in ﬁne term in spite or . long
absence irom the slab, and let the vi
itors down with only three hits and
struck out si Corbin was lound ior-
eight sateties by Grinnell's marksman.
three of which were negotiated by Cap-
tain Ficken. Keniston was also there
with the war club and poled out two
hits, a single and a twobagger, out or
three times up, and 00229115 got two
singles out of four tinres up. Both
teams ﬁelded well, Simpson pertorming
a shade the better, Jackson in center-
ﬁeld contributed the sensation of the
afternoon when he bagged Anderson's
ﬁy to short right in the eiglilh after
a hard run. Baekston Mathews also
was sure on high touts and chased
nearly to the wire lerrce to retire Brin-
ton in the second, brrt he was unable
to propel the ball to second base under-
any circumstances, and Grinnell stole
bases at will.

Crinnell star-led things with their-
usual rrrn in the ﬁrst. Carney was
sate when llolmes performed in srev
like taslrion, and Ficken's threebase
drive to leit brought him in. Fickeri
was called out at the plate alter what
]ool<ed like a successt'ul execution or
the squeeze play. Nothing lnrther
happened to 'alter the score board rrntil
the third when the visitor-s secured
their lone tally, Dulln, who batted
ﬁrst, maintained his existence at ﬁrst
when Cozzens juggled the ball too long.
He promptly showed his ingr-atitude
by stealing second and was put across
by inﬁeld outs by Hooker and Holmes.
Crinnell took trvo more in the lorrrtlr
on a base on balls to Kerriston, a passed
third strike which gave Far-well a lite,
and Brinton's two-base drive.

Another tally was added rn the littb
when Kerriston straightened out one
or Mr, Colblll's shoots tor tw-ow- bags
went to third on a passed ball arrtl
coming home when Anderson laid down
his life in a well executed squeeze

The last two were cor-alled in the
seventh, Fichen opened it with his
double to leit, and ulich was unable
to get out of the way oi Corhill’s "Iieall
ball" Ficlten and their both stole
on the next ball pitched, Ficken scored
on Co- ens' out, Sorics to Kipp, socn
alter, and printon, who was running
tor L‘lich went to third on the pla-
lirinton was then squeezed in by M
Creath Her-c ended the scoring.

Miss err,

(With the exception ot the arra lrom
Samson and Deliia, all of Miss \Vuit’s
songs are in English).

The splrretlid impression being made
by the Minneapolis musicians and
their emipent conductor in the South
is evidenced by the billowing excerpt
hour a Birmingham pdper. M Allen
Johnson, Birmingham-s leading music
crit, expresses this opinion in the
Birmingham News: ,

"Seldom does one hear- such a her»
feel. distribution of brass. reed arrtl
string instruments— such exquisite
blending and so thorough a mastery
exhibited over cacti irrdrvrdrral instru-
rnerrt. And therein is discovered the

The Sophomores enjuycd a
rainy day picnic in the men' gymllar
slum Saturday evening; From the
glow irlg reports one would Judge that it
was itllly as much, perhaps better, en-
joyed than on outdoor picnic, which
was necessarily abandoned.

Supper was served, picnic fashion,
on the ﬂoor, and alter that, a field
meet was star-ted. Such events as
cracliepraces, Sack»l‘aces, and relays
caused much fun and hilarity. As
Political Conditions are in vogue in
Gl nnell this week, a very exiting
Political Convention was held Sallllu
day evening. The outcome was the
unanimous election of the Suliragette
nominee, Blanche Gibbs.

Alter the Convention, the ﬁeld meet
was continued, and of course the party
did not adjourn without a few “col-
lege" dancesivil'ginizt Reel and oth-
ers similar.

President Main gave a very interest-

ing and inspiring talk at Vespers Sun-
da,. He read several passages trorn
the Acts oi the Apostles ﬁrst, then
compared Paul‘s attitude to God with
that or the present day. Tire great-
ness at Paul consisted in the rrnceasir g
st ng tor the unattainable.
. Considering the people of today, how
many are Selfrsatlsﬁed and do not have
the lite of Cod in their lives! The
worst sin a man can culllnlil. is to stay
where he is. become petriﬁed, and not
advance, for salvation is hie.

The people or the present age were
compared to the Pharisees who were
not great because they wanted nothing
signiﬁcant. in the presence or God we
are all alike in lire ideals.

in closing, be emphasized the
thought, that the truly practical man is
the riran who realizes himsclt by reach.
ing tor the unattainable.

Tire choir gave a splendid rendition
or a iarorite anthonr, Shelley's “Hark.
liar My Soul." The solo parts were
et't'ectively taken by Vera Attwooll antl
Raymond Stevenson.

Des Moines and Cornell are both to be
counted on tor a nnnrber of points aid
State Teachers has a three-anon team
that should annex a tow places,

in the sprints Wilson ot Coe will
have everything his own way. Tooley
and Jones of Grinneil, Lristed ot Cor-
nell arid Wilson of Simpson will be his
closest contender . Johnson, of High
land Parlt, and Sherman or Coe, will
run close to trim in the quarter.

Dnrey, or Des Moines College, will
be the star actor in the distances, with
his teammate, Miller, Schluter, ol.‘
State Teachers, Balcar, ot Coe, and St:
John at Grinnell well up toward the
tront. Osborne, or Simpson, and Daw-
kills, tire'Grrnnell captain, bare the
