ORCHESTRA MAKES GREAT
IMPRESSION IN SOUTH

'ﬁis’year is the ﬁrst time the Slim-re
apolis symphony Orchestra, Emil
oherhorier- conductor, has ever played
in the South, and while the tour our
braced but a iew cities, its appearance
at Birmingham was or greatest inter-
est in view or that town's leaning tar
wards the New York organizations.
There uere many, who, even alter the
success or the New York concert, had
doubt or the Northwest‘s a lity to
produce a really great organization,
this making the overwhelming success
or the Minneapolis ’Sympllorly 0r~
chestra all the more important and in
creasing the pleasure of recording the
same. .

Allen Johnson. the disﬁugulsht‘le mus
sioal cr' ic oi the Birmingham News
goes so far as to say “The Minneapolis
Symphony Orchestra is the pc
similar organization now before the
public, It is nothing less than El. mur
sical wonder." And again, "No better
has been heard within this city or this
section oi the South,” Following are
the salient points lrom his article:

“Much has been said and written or
the coming or this excellent orchestra
\\ith its accompaning soloists but
since it has been heard musical Bil'lns
ingham is enjoying a rare ecsmc
Not merely in the spirit uhicch pro-
tiously can tile Music Festival said to
have been opened with a Mime oi glory.
not one dissatisﬁed auditor could be
found alter either the alternoon or
evening concerts yesterday, while
those who had pron ‘s d rllurrli were
criticized for not admitting even more,
Alter having once realized tlle musical
worth ot‘ the orgai tion, the audience
grew so enthusiastic that proludes or
the ﬁrst feu notes or the more i'amiliar
classics brought forth long and lolid
applause Bi mingham know that it
was hearing the compositions or the
masters, interpreted rnasterrullv by an
orchesiro than which no better has
been heard within this city or this
section oi the South, Birmingham has
been one, ﬁguratively. Tile (it 's lm'r
crs oi harmony threw themselves at
the rent of the Minneapolis Orchestra.
The Music Festival is the greatest treat
musical Birmingham has been altered
ill many seasons and the Minneapolis
Symphony Orchestra is the peer oi
any similar organ .ation bcl’oie the
Dulrlil’, lt is nothing less than a
mus al wonder."

R. F. .l, i': the Birmingham Lulgcl‘,

string numbers of the encores were
deﬁantly delicate. One or them, a (as

erl it new standard of perfection Ober~
hoirer's mcn rendered it better than
either Damrosch's or Herbert‘s,"

HEAR TALK ON FRIENDSHIP.
Miss Morris Gives Address at
Y, W. C. A. This Week.

The girls who attended the r w,
.i. liroeting ’l‘llul' or evening, nor-c

cscd to listen to a lrealiiirul trill:
‘l~‘l'lclltlslllp” by Miss Morris. State
Student seererni, ‘Frll‘m p" is a
slibjcct oltelt discussed, but Miss iroi»
ris’ thoughts were unusually original
and lieipllrl,

Miss Morris mentioned iolrr realiir-o
merits or a true friend. First u e should
admire and giie cur iriends the praise
they deserve. The next thing a iricnd
does is to sympathize not only with a
iricnd in trouble but also uhen she is
happy and not let jealousy creep in,
Again we rnnst trust our lriends and
ﬁnally serve them. In much 'on, she
said, all thru our lives there l\ill be a
lack in that which human rricndships
can do ior us. But there is a iriend
who is willing and longing to be the
all suriieient iriend and that triend is
God.
