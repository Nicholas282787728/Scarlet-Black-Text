Missouri Valley Race Will Be
Hard to Decide Between Ames.

Saturtla '5 games brought no change
in the race tor the Missouri Valley
Championship. All of the teams were
matched with minor colleges and dis-
posed or them in every else. Three
teams loom up strong this year, Ne-
hraska, Drake and Ames. Nebraska by
virtue of past periormances is in line
lor the title. As yet they linvo had
no conference games but take on ills.

and Ames. Drake should dispose
or Washington and Missouri as well.
(or neither are helieved to he as strong
as Kansas. Amcs has played one game
and by winning so decisively over Mis-
som-i has eliminated their claims.

The winner of the Missouri Valley"
championship will have to he decided
by comparative scores; Nebraska plays
neither Ames nor Drake. One at the
most likely teams plays neither of the
othtr two. As Nebraska and Ames
will not right it out this year the stand-
in got these two teams rests on compar~

’13 ANNUAL BUANII MAKES MERRY

Reunion and Hallowe’en Dinner
Given at Rule Home Last
Evening.

'l‘lle Nineteen Thirteen Annual Board
was last night entertained at a Hale
lowe'cn Brew at the “Rule Hovol" by
three girls of the board. Dorothy Sihr
Icy, Elizabeth Brett and Jennie Rule.
A slxcourse “itch dinner was served
and toasts responded to in happy vein.

nics and campﬁres. Professor and
Mrs. Paul Peck were the guests at
honor.

Rev. Martin Talks at Vespers.
Rev. B. F. Martin, or Marshalltown.

spoke at Vespers Sunday. choosing as
his subject. “Conceptions ol the Rolls
ious Life of Modern Educational Insti-
tutions as Seen by an Outsider."

hi: said, “The negative conception is
the charge that the religious and edu-
cational life are separated, that the
student grows away from religion, and
that the college graduate doesn’t iden-
tify himself with religious activities."

He then gave the positive conception,

saying that this “as not so at Grinnell,
and mentioned all or the religious ac-
t as here.
Who three basic Motors in educa-
tion are (1) The immature, undevelr
oped being: (2) The goal or destiny.
and (a) The older and more mature
beings in the Institution who are seek-
ing to bring the immature being to
its destiny. We often emphasize one
to the neglect of others.

The great. cry now is {or the pl’actir
ml, in education. Our religion is the
doing of things. Tile supreme purpose
or education is to develop a social ton.
sciousness, and the supreme factor of
education is to create an atmosphere
which will make the doing or things
most effective, but secondary.

Christianity, ﬂist of all makes us
live our lives most eliective '. “Unrer
served service and devotion" should he
(he \vatcllword ol the great army of
students.”

In closing Rev. Mariiil said, ”Let us
not give ourselves aver merely to the
tho't of location. greed, or gain. but
live tile life OI CI]liS.t."
