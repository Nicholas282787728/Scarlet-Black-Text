are Drake’s Reliables e Bear
Stories Coming from

Des Moines.

Today the Grinn‘eil football team
races what will undoubtedly be its
hardest game of tile season. The bear-
storics which are emanating lrom the
Drake camp should be taken with a
moderately large-sized grain or salt.
Possibly one or two or the Drake regu—
lars may be unable to play. httt it to
sale to say that the team which line:
up against the Scarlet and Black Wain
riot-s this alter-noon will be as stress
as any Drake. team that has appeared
this year—which means that it will be
stronger than the eleven which beat
its last year by a lone touchdown.
Drake is scared about this game,
but this tact instead ot matting a Grin-
netl victory easy, will only make ii;
the harder. The students of the Des
Molnes instittition are, it is true, in—
clined to look upon the Grinnelt game
as a practice session, but Coach Grit-
tith and his warriors tear that they
are on the verge ot receiving a hit-
ntiliuting detest in what titer have
hithrrto regarded as a minor engage
tnent, and this realization will make
them deioto their entire strength to
this atternooit' gable,

Another tonsitlel'zltion which nil:-

a determination to win is the met

Missouri team, which they had expect.-
