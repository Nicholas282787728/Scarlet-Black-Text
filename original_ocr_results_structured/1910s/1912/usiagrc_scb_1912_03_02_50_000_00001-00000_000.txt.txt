Student Volunteer Secretary
Speaks Friday Morning.
My, Schwartz, iowa Secretary- of the

Student Volunteer Movement, gave a
good tall: at chapel Friday morning,
Mr Schwartz speaks in an enthusiastic.
interesting manner, and crowded a
great deal of truth into his short
speech,

in ms iisits lhi-u colleges and uur
veisities ot the state, Mr. Schwartz has
reached the decision that most college
men and women have no definite pi ,
pose in lite. To be useful, and of any
worth whatever, our lives must be
dominated and tollllolletl by some defi-
iiltc motive, There seem to be four
motives prevalent in the lite oi today.
The ﬁrst, that of getting rich, is not
a very high or ideal motive; the sear
ond, that of seeking happiness, is not
always successlul, as happiness is a
liyplodilct and does not come from
putsuing it; the third iiotive. tame,
is fulﬁlled only by the pursuit of some
thing higher, duty, or serric. The
tourth motive is that of service—serv-
ice to God and our fello ‘lllen. Now
is a time at social and political unrest
and now is the time lo show true
Christian service and biing order out
or this uni-est, The greatest need to-
day is that of deep, true, conviction oi
the Christian people, And the tiling
for college men and women to do is to
find their place in God's plan, then to
do their best in that place
