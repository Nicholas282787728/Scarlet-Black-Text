Y. W. WORK IS INTERESTING

Social Side Is Large Factor In
Grinnell Life.

ITS DOORS OPEN TO ALL

It Promotes Fellowship Among
College Girls.

' The work of the i'. w. c. A. is gen-
erally conﬁned, in the minds ot most
or us, to religious meetings cvery
Thursday etching, and tho iremteut
distribution or small enielopes into
which we put any ehli'h ibaiigc we ni- -
have. Observation soon corrects this
impression, and we iealize that it is
rpaiiy a very deep and vital thing in
the College lite and that its scope has
broadened iroin a purely religious oi»
ganization, to one that touches (lime
Hell's social lilo at evcrv point,

Perhaps there is no time when the
work oi the Y. W, C, A. is so import-
ant, when its value is so tully l'L-allzctl
and appreciated as at the ﬁrst at the
year, when every etluit is put lorth to
make eaeh new girl 'toei that she is
genuinely iielcoitled, that there is real
sympathy and understanding lor that
homesick, lonesome healing that comes
to almost every ireshman girl, some-
time during the iiist ten days ol ad-
justnicnt.

The General Reception at llie rust ot
the year, is in tiie hands oi the i' w.
and Y. M. social committee, and while
it is looked upon by the old students
with various degree,- oi enthusiasm
and anticipation. yet it allot-as a
splendid method or getting its new
Grinneiiite hmudilltetl with everyone
else in school. To the. anxious
nuirer as to ways and means ot know.
ing first whom one has met, there is
no compunction in answer-tug You
can speak to everyone if you ham to
the General.”

'Tho reception given to new girls

The Y. w. C A. has the fundamental

The Self-Government League.

A )ear ago last September mere was
torincd among the women or the Col-‘
lege, an orgrn .ation known as they
Soil Government League, the purpose‘
oi which stated in the eoiistitutionl
as ioliows-

"The object at this organization shall
be to regulate, hroadtn anti rel-inc the
social lire oi the women; to support
and unliit the social standards oi the
Colleé’P: to matte llle indiv lives
oi the women more wholesome by Starr
sihie living; and to term an ot'licial
body to represent the women in matters
or general toiicge intci-cst"

Grinneil has certain traditions which
create a wholesome atmosphere in the
college commun v, ‘0'. there were no
deﬁnite regulations regarding certain
things which ciiieliy aiiccled the wo-
men students and it was partly t‘or
this that the League was organized.

That woman everywhere set the slime
dards socially, is general - understood
and llirii the League it will he possible
to adjust the social his in accordance
with the truest ideals oi Grinneil And

ga ' lion. Three times a year the

regarding our community lite. At this
time tree . on and act-tin intro

women should take the initiative.

'Give the Consumer the Best Value: PossL

Is it any wonder

that with such a policy steadfastly pursued, with
the Right Styles, and a readiness always to “D0

Keeps Growing."

ﬁﬂlNNELL’S LARGEST AND BEST SHOE STDRE

 

At the ltcginnity; oi tho year, cdth

with the householder, is author ed to

t-niis ’Ltlllou) i kept

’l‘lleso regulations, made In a cent
millet: 0| \lolllLll students, (We regard
no spccnie hours ror callers, study,
i'elllillg, lot-hing doors, etc., and a deli»
iiitc statciucnt rcgilrllilli: the tradition
Lllal Lllel‘F he "0 attendance in dances
during term time, and the Sunday reg-
ulation regarding call . dii ing,
strolling, etc. .

This i‘espalisillilily is in itself a

ll‘orce in developing the sense at honor,

aml cooperation in upholding the high-
est ideals. '
What has been accomplished during
the ﬁrst year and time months?
First, There is a better spirit ot car
operation and a willingness to con-

,Tol’m to the regulations or the League.

As several students have late - to
marked: “We simply accept it now, as
a part lit the life in Grlnhcil~and we
see that it is a wise plan."

Then the League has been a help in
strengthening the sentiment tor Grin-
neli traditions thru having the tradi-
tions stated in a more deﬁnite man-
ner and tllru the agreement by the
vote of the women. to uphold the tra-
dltiens.

Again, thru the Letidlle i'egulli'ion=,
women students who hail not learned
the value or living in a systematic
way, have been helped in planning for
a nise cod-elation of work and recrea-
tion, and in keeping hours which will
be conducive to better work and better
health. Honevcr, much remains to be
done along this line, Special attention
is also given to the number or punitive
activities in which each student may
engag%iil order that there be a bet-
ter distribution, and that no individual
he in ddugcr of ovcrdoing.

Tho Krowlli oi an organization like
this our, must necessarily be slow, and
here, as in tliemnnyinstitutions wlicre

is no doubt hilt that much has already
