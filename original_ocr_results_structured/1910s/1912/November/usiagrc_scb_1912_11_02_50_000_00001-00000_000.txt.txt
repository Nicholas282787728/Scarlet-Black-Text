Tire team representing Chrcstpma-
thla society won the Mei-rill Political
Debate Thursday night. Lloyd Tay-
lor. ’14, and Francis Ellis. '14, come
prised the winning team, They upheld
the cause or Tnit anti the Republican
party. The contest was one at the
best that has been iield since the Mer-
)‘ili debate became an annual event.

it has been the custom heretofore to
have two or the Societies debate upon
the candidates at the two leading par
ties, but on account of the untlsilzti sit-
uation this year it has thought advr -
able to introduce an innovation. Quill
and Gavel society was admitted to the
debate in order to secure representa-
tion for the three leading parties in the
ﬁeld at present.

The alignment of the tennis was de-
elded by lot, and Chrestoniathia was
elected to support President Tait and
the Republican par Forum advocat-
ed the cause at Wilson and tire Demor
crats, wiiile Quill and Gavel tool: up the
standard or T. R. and the lieu' Pi'ogl' ~
sive party. _

Lloyd Taylor opened ior ctivosio, and
declared the intention oi his team in
support thc three main contentious
looking toward thc nomination ni lir
'l‘aft: Flrs‘ly, tho leptihlit‘uli party has
a better record than minor the Demo
crnts or Pi'ogiessiye puiry, Ee'nntlll
the, I’izlltib'iican platloiiii is worthy tlio
support, oi the people; and Lliilt’ ihc
pcrsoual quail cs oi Irli‘ Tait cntulo
him to the nomination ilr. Ta, or, in
a woltconstrrrctcd rooth, uphold the
ﬁrst two or those points

Mr. Carter made the openings spurt-ii
for For-um. (liiilllilig the nomination
for the Dt/Iilot'ratic candidate, on two
grounds: First, that thc Drrrincralic
standards are higher titan the iicpu
lican, wircn judged by party icadc
and party records; and setondly, that
Wilson would make a better- prcsidcrit
than woulri Tait.

Mr Romans nradc the ﬁrst speech tor-

the Quill and Gavttl team, upholding|

the Progi- _sn'e party on two .ints'
First. that it ultcts the pr cut demand
for a broader tltmocrnt, , and second.
that it principlcs nill promot irrriu

iiir. Ellis tlcnt-d the dilett argument
ior Chrcsto by taliing up the personal
characteristics or the three (or: itiate

an appeal tor the election oi Mr. Tril‘t.

pleasing presentation of Austin Mac»
Hugﬂh‘s Cichl' farce. "Ofﬁcer 666," at

full of amusing situations, which, :llr
though they seldom even approached
plausibility, served to hold the capch

Probably the best bit oi acting was
i’uiitishcd by Richard Fairall, in the

also wcil presented. The remainder

{By H. W. Mauricio).

The proper evaluation or such a per—
iormante as Mischa. Elm-ill gave laSi;
evening at Her iclt Chapel would re-
quire the judginent of a critic whose
experience might cover not one bid:
many generations. Hrs playing has
the sure consciousness of master!
which linlts it with the greatest. He
treats his art with proiound sincerity:
his artistic reeling ior beautiiui phras-
ing is so liner-ring that it is not neces-
sary for him to play tricks with the
violin in order to earn the admiration
even oi the shallow listener. No longer
a ho, wonder, Elman is that still more
wonderiui thing, a manwouder, com-
bining in his pin, rig ireshness at
youth with maturity of expression and
sense or proportion. .

earnestness, in very great contrast to
