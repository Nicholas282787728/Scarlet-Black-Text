Senior Production of “Captain

drama above named was presented last
evening by the senior class or Griouell
College. The audience was thoroughly
entertained as was evidenced by the
close attention given the play and the
irequent interruptions of applause. The
production was a good one on the
whole, though hardly up to tlle stands

of the past season, Mcvcly Mary Ann

P. Rynn has certainly a very difficult
task every year with the Senior Play.

The demands during the spring term
on the time oi members at the gradus

it has come to he expected that the
Senior Play shall be some drama call-
ing for a. large cast of characters. Such
a play always requires n Vast amount
of rehearsal to produce smooth re
sults in the group scenes. Many parts
have invariably to be assigned to per-
sons who have had no dramatic experi»
ence. Captain Jinks was written
to exploit the attractive personality of
Ethel Barrymore, then a rising light
in the dramatic ﬁrman'ient, and outside
of the roles of Madame Trentoni, rro-
fessor Beiliarti, her foster father, and
Madame Greenborough, there are no
leading parts which are convincing or
sympathetic. The men, including Cap~
tain Jinks himseii, are sticlrs, although
Jinks does exhibit some character
development after he falls in love with
the opera smr.

it is a fact that the whole cast of
last evening's play was never together

sults, unrkr these and the other cir-
cumstances above rsierred to, were
much better than could have been ex-
pected, ior there were no glaring inade-
quaeies noticeable. One missed the

DR. RULLINS AT VESPERS

Tabor's New President Gives Last
Vesper Address of Year—
”Stt Cecilia’s Mass” Given

The closing Vesper seivice always
seems to mean, more tdligibly than the
other Conlelunuenit‘nt exercises, unless
it be Senior chapel, the end of the
college year. For those who hear, ll
means the giving up of this Iiedutilul
service for n time; for many of those
who take part, it means the l‘ost par-
ticipation in a worship which they
have aided to make seeliili‘ and beauti-
ful. ‘

Sunday’s Vesper service was chep-
tlonally beautiful. Gounod's St.
Cecilia Mass was the musical offering
of the day and was sung almost in its
entirety, only the Credo being omitted,
And it was sung magniﬁcently. The
vesper choir which has been moulded
into so effective a singing organization
by a Year of training under Professor
G. L. Pierce, fairly autdid itself. The
solos were all ﬁnely taken. Miss Vera
Attwooll, Professor D. E. Peck and
Rowland r, H. Manuel sang the tries
in the Kyrie and Gloria. The tenor
solo in the Sanctus was well taken by
Mr. Sprague and Miss Korns gave the
solo in the Benedictus.
