CHRIST, THE CENTRAL FACT
IN THE WORLD TODAY

Vrspct- Cltolr Sang-“Fol- God So Loved
the World” by
Smmer.

The wondeliul character oi Jesus
and His contribution to the world was
well brought out in a talk by Profes-
sor Edward A. Steiner at the Vesper
service Sunday. This is the ﬁrst occa-
sion for a long time that Dr. Steiner-
has been heard in Vespers.

"History untimateiy gives everyone
the place he deserves," was the opcnr
inz statement or the address. and Dr.
Steiner proceeded to discuss the place
which history had actually assigned to
Jesus. Notwithstanding the met that
some people still cling to the belief
that Jesus ncrcr e isictl and that oth-
er, llllllk that he ha, a good man, but
one whose doctrines arc now outgrown,

ﬁrst year men are conﬁdent of victory,
which they feel three or four stars
will bring them uhile the sophomores
are basing their hopes in an abundance
ot‘ mediocre material to take the sec-
onds and thirds together with a few
ﬁrsts in the d , tances, Thc failure of

Gustai‘son to gain the required num<

a sudden drop in the sophomore stock

to the Freshmen evens things up some-
what.

Tire sprints are conceded to Mar-
sintll, '13, with Edson, 12, and Sher-
man, '13, lighting for the second place.
The high hurdles should aiiord a good
race between Kensinger, '12, and Capt.
Eagan, oi the Freshmen, as both men
are showing up about the same. The
Freshmen seem to have the call on the
ﬁrst two places in the low stielrs with
Hunter and Eagan, altlio Carney and
Kensinger shorild oiier some good op-
position.

lt is rather dortbtirrl who will start
the quarter on either team altho it
is iavorable that Dan-kins and Barret
will represent the Sophs and Sherman,
the Freshmen. Dawlilns is the inver-
ite because oi his showing in last
year's dual anti a little longer expert

Tire Sophomores hope oi winning
the meet lies in capturing practically
all the points in the distance events.

race belongs to hiiri with Kensillger or
Pierce second. Young or St. John are
both good to win the irrile altho Holly,
