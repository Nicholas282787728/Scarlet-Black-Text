There has been a great deal oi disc
crissian about soccer ioothall as a s -b-
stitute tor the Aeml‘icim college same
In one of the speeches on the lintitiiie
program last il'ediiesdai Arthur Ilmils
inond described the soccer game. The
Seal-let and Bud: . Marbled to Mr
Hammond tor the 1ollowiug descripc
tlon oi the lieid, players and rules oi
the game as used in soccer ioothall.

Soccer is played on a iicld lot: to i710
tar-(ls long and all to 100 )m‘i‘ls wide,
The lines at each end oi the ileld ~c
called goal lines. These on the sidcs
oi the iieltl are called lile touch lines.
At each end ot the lield there is a «out
eight yards wide and eight trot high
Running out tw-cive yards ii-oni each
goal post and connected hy a line phr-
rillei to tire goal lines are lines which
include an area linoun as the penalti-
area. At a distance Lli'elvc yor s ironi
the center of the goal post and in the
middle oi the area is n place called tht
penalty iiick mark.

The hall is pirt into play by being
hielted oil porn the center of a circle
wltli a radius at ten yards which is
placed in the middle oi the lieid.

The hall used in pin, is siini to a
haslzet hall The ortitiaie are a ietci-oo
and two iin s men whose duties corre
'spond to the present umpires.

A game is ninety niliiiitcs ions with
a fivernlimlte interniis loii between
halves.

A team consists of eleven men, (Mir
torwards, three liaiihachs, three loll.
Ducks anti a goal heopcr.

The ball is put into play hour the
center ot the iield by a hlohoii and tho
object ot the play is to put tho hull nn.

players who must throw it over his

The game requires shill and good
judgment. it is ouito an art to pass
the ball quicldy and accurately by the
use oi the head and hnees, oiie oi
the roost dliiicnlt plays is to dribble
the boil with the teet. In this play a
player never allows the hall to get
more thou a yard in tront oi him and
carries it down the field at top speed

The player in soccer is always fast,
the ball some tunes traveling trom one
end oi the iield to another in is very

speed, skill. courage and to both may

than the American game can ever be

seilll a track team to an indoor meat
which is to be held in Omaha some
time in March, All the Missouri Val-

Gl‘iliuell will probably send a few men,
although all the track team will not

eligible for the Missouri Valley meet,

Pi-olessor hiaiilr Air/ell oi Leland
Staniord iriiiiorsity gives a hrict- state
iiieiii in The independent, oi January
27 or the i'cotball situation in Califor-
iiiu het'oi-c thc ioioriii and alter. Ac-
cording to this account the American
college game was developcd at Stan-
iord niid culiioi-iiia as it has been de-
veloped elservii. The game appeared
to he or [nature in colicgc lite, but as
the game dcvcloped and became more
and more eioiitilic it began to become
more and more objectionable. it was.
eiident that the game had ceased to
he a sport in any sense oi the word. It
was played on , by a chosen ieiv."

Regarding the introduction oi the
game proic sor Alizell goes on to say:
“From the first the Stanlord student!
objection to the new game was very
small. There were several reasons tor
the smooth launching oi rugby, but
thiei among them was the iact that the
name was enjoyable—there was tiin in
the practice and more was ion in the
malt es. The old. hard, grinding, ex-
l‘llu‘itlllg milk.Q [mil lliolileuium play
had givcii way to swiit and exhilarat-
ing passing and the wca oine drill on
signals had _\ 'elded to rapid changes of
piuv where much tliinhlng and ready
agi ty had to play a part. But the
main points in ilic game “hull make it
a real sport are that it is poor playing
to he dawned with the hall and that it
s ioiil piai ng to inter-ici-c. The first
leads to the spectacular passing rushes
and second rules out mass and momen-
tum plays.

"That the new game has increased
the iootball shill oi the mcn playing is
evident irom that the new game re—
turn-es a skill which the old game was
without For every man who could punt
13 yards iour years ago, we now have
ten, the whole team have to do these
thin 'l‘ ,is makes the game toot-
llllll ‘ "

That, the rugby game is thoroughly
e lined l the players is witnessed in
tho roiupai isoii between conditions lour
rears ago and now. “ii there was any
onlorinont in tho old game it was thor»
oirohly rtnccnlrd,“ says Professor An»
coll, All the lug game in November
the told all ii'lrl w in its horrcn
lawyers was the ioiicsoniost part at
the Siiilllurll campus. The university
and second trams v'olililn’t pl-v and

the nyaiorlty oi ilie men on the corn-
niis have hard, exhilarating eycrcise
without any liarniliil l suits. it was
the hope oi bringing about this condi-
tion that iiidrirtd the faculty to recoup
mend rirglw. in conclusion Protessor
Alizell sa “And so aitcr iour years
or rugby the students like and enjoy
the game; they tind the old ioothall
slow and stupid. And they would
strongly ohjeet to any attempt to bring
it back, The game is also played by
constantly increasing numbers in the
smaller colleges and in many high
schools throughout the state."

The Woman's Athletic association
has voted to allow the players on a
girl's basket ball team winning three
games the right to wear honor pins. It
is understood that the class to which
the players belong Will buy the pins.
