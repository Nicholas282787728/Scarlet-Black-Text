it isn’t too late for a New Years
resolution noL to tail: in the reading
room of the library.

Chancellor Day of Syracuse Unil'el'~
sity, said the other ila, regarding the
football situation in his O‘l‘l'“ illstltur
tion: “I'd rather never have another
game of football at Syracuse university
than to have even one man liilled in
half a century. lnrproled rules have
made the game more deadly. Unless
it can be rendered safe, We must adopt
either Rugby or Association, or the
state legislatures ivill abolish it."

It Wouldn't be a half had idea to
not before the state legislature gets

an opportunity.

THE CHAPEL TALKS,

Recently a uumher oi the Seniors
have remarked about the fine chapel
services of the past two months. The
opinion seems to be that never in the
past three or four years has any more
been offered the students irom day to
day than is otter-ed in the short tallrs
that have had a regular place in these
services lately. The untlcir ssni it
who neglect thes services is missing
much that ho ill regret latcr. With

less time in college the Junior andl

Senior will come to a realization ulteu
it is too lateiwllen the chapel so vices
are beyond reach, Now i: a good time
to start to attend regular Each in-
dividual and all together will set some
thing good out of the service.

TIIE ALUMNI WRITE.

all of these, but the folloiiins coin
munication coming irom one who has
had‘ in his time an active intercst in
Grinnell life and who at present is
one of the most loyal of the college's
alumni body, is typical of a number or
opinions that have been expressed.

right, but it has no place in Gl'iunell

not good. I got up as many dances on
