The plan, proposed by the College
Council. to limit the numher oi actiu
ities in which a student may engage
is not altogether had; it has. however,
certain undesirable features. Among
these is the clause which dis iniinates
against the man who is earning his

in making it iinpossihie tor the man
who is inking nlleen hours of college
work and is earning his board and
room to play foot ball without special
permission. and even with that per-
mission to engage in any other major
activity, it is overlooking the iolloiying

(1) That the student may wait to-
bles at a club and tend a lurnace, and
in so doing spend less time then his
more fortunate brother does in loanng.

(2) That work, so iar irom inca-
pacitating a man for other activities
may give him a sound body and a
clear mind. -

(a) That the man who Works may
have enough energy. industry and pui's
pose to overcome any handicap. ii

This may appear to be a rumor
point. but it is a rel-r vital one to

achieving this there must no sari

To do this it is important to hear
in mind these facts:

1. 'luat each day has only a col.

vitlual is compelled to spend part or
that time in mechanical labor such as
incident to work ior hoard and room
:so much time or each day is gone.
The college work demands some more
time or a very deﬁnite nature as to
the minimum feature and then the ac-
tivities which a man may participate
in, may take some more time. These
demands for an expenditure or the
time o! Lila day cannot be avoided.

2. The committee thru the present
plan places in the reach of every man
and woman the opportunity to partial

certain point, which if scholarship may
warrant can certainly be carried to a
maximum which no one can object to.
