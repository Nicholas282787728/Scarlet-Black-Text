it was without question the greatest
meet ever held in this part ot the

won by Steele at Missouri in the last

There was grcat unocrtainty when
the starter lined the men nu tor the
century dash. Both Wilson and Had»
dock had run in ten not while Reed oi
Nebraska was good ior ten orle so the
outcome was it matter of consular-able
uncertainty tor the big crowd that had
assembled to see tllc meet. Wilson at

As tirinnell boasts of being the old-
est collcgc west oi the Mississippi. also
she can boast oi having the oldest lit-
erary society. The Chi-cstoniatiiian so—
ciety was founded in 1352 while the col-
lege was still located at Davenport.
Chi-estoniathia n as rounded by John H.
Windsor, ’51, Williaui Windsor. '54,
and Lucien Eaton, '55. The purpose
was "to attain proﬁciency in speaking
and debating." The society was kept
up until the time when the college leit
llarenport Then there were a few
years oi inactivity. '

When the college was revived in
its new home, the literary society was
also revived. The men who ﬁgured
largely in the rooiganization. were R.
M. idaines, ’65, ,i. P. Lyman, '67, and
J. H. Herrick. 'ﬁs.

After running ior a tew years, in
1870 a great many oi the members
were taken to term a new society to
be known as Grinnell institute. Ai-
tliough there was some slight dissatis~
iactioir among the members at that
time, yet everyone tclt the need oi an-
oth°r society. The loss of so many‘
men crippled Chrcstoinathia and tor a.
time it was ve -r weak.

Calacogathia was the ﬁrst gil'ls' so-
ciety to be ior-med yet they were never
closely aiiiliated with Chrestolnathia
and in 1870 they became allied with his
stitute, Later, in “2, the Ellis soe

iety was rounded and became atiiliat-
ed with Chrestomathia.

Chrostomathia has had two note-
worthy anniversaries. One of these
was held in 1392 anti was the 40th an-
niversary, The other was ill 1903 and
was an to cxtcnsivc. This semi-centeir
