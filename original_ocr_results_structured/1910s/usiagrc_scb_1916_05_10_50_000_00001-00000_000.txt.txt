60E TURNS TABLES:

Dunlap Pitches Tight Ball For Vis-
itors and Make: Winning Run
in Eighth Frame-Little
Is Star 0‘ the Locals
With Two Hits.

After being held scoreless for six
innings in a close battle on Ward
Field yesterday, Coe staged a. batting
rally in the seventh and eighth rounds,
and drove in three runs, enough to
beat the Grinnell nine by a 3-2 scor-

A study of the score book shows
that Gl'irlllell tailed to hit in the pinch-
es, while Coe connected when hits
meant runs. Both pitchers kept the
biiigles scattered, but Coe hunched
their blows in two inning, while in
only one traine did Grinnell get more
than one hit. in "midi-lg, however,
honors were all with the home team.

“Doc‘ Little was the individual stoi-
lot G nnell. garnering a double and a
triple in tour trips to the plate, and
accepting thirteen chaitccs. Dunlap,

\\'itl.l an tincxpccted detect at the
hands at Carleton chalked up against
them last Saturday, Grinnclls track
team is busy priming for one or the
biggest tests at the season, the Iowa.
Coitterence Meet at Cedar Rapids next
Saturday.

All the colleges iii the Conference.
including Grinncll, Cornell, Coe, Simp- -
son. Highland park, Des Moines, Par-
sons, Iowa Wesleyan, and Penn. are
expected to send representatives to
this annual. aiiai, which is doped
this year to furnish some exceedingly
close coriipetition in a number of
events. From records which have
been made by the r arious men in these
colleges it can he pr dicted that the
points in this incet will be fairly well
scattered among the most important
enti es. ntor-ningside, tormerly a.
strong contender in the meet, is barred
this year by the ruling that only Cort-
ierence schools may compete. ‘

Grinuell and Coe both loont up as
possibilities for iii-st honors, hot it is
’iiilpossible to predict any college as
a marked iavorite. until their dual
with Des Monies last Fri Highland
Park had been plumcd as a possible
i st in the Conteicncc race. But al-
though they won this nrcct train the
Baptists the tune iir ruost cases was
