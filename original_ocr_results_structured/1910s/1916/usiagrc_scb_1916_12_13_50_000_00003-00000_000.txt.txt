LYMAN HOWE PICTURES
A’l‘ COLONIAL DECEMBER 18

Travel, more and more, is becoming
an essential part 0[ an education. It
is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.
No doubt this tact explains the great
vogue anti success of Lyman H. Howe‘s
Travel Festival which comes to the
Colonial on Dec. 13. Over three mil-
lion people who travel annually with

lLyman H. Howe know trorn experienec
that no entertainment before til
American public offers more Whole~
some and satistyiog pleasure. For th-
student and thinker it always unvouu
vitally interesting scenes of lifehelr
toms, and activities in other lands;
tor the professional business man or
woman it is an enjoyable relaxation,
while for the whole family it is a most
welcome diversion from daily cares \ l
