{acuity hits I00 much control over
your conduct as lllelnhcrs 0f the coi~
lege community, Should take a. few
hours Off some afternoon and look
over some of the Bid college catalogues
of Grinneil which are in the Gl'innell
section of the library. It is it safe
wager you would forget your griev‘
nnces against the disciplinavians 0f
Grinnell and thank yunr lucky stars
that you are attending the College in
1316 instead of in the latter half 01
the last Centuryl

miles and regulations were more

numerous in those days than courses
oi study. And they were not called
rules but went under the designation
‘ot “laws," And tor laws which lolly
accomplished their purpose they had
the enactments oi our modern legisla-
hires backed clear oii the map. More-
over, the ones who made these laws
also eniorced them and it is a cer<
iainty that President‘hiagoun and his
associates saw that they were carried
out to the letter.
Week Night Dates Again.

You remember how there was so
much discussion last spring about
week-night ”dates." It was too had
the men could not call on the young
ladies at the "Quadu at least six ev-
enings a week. There was even argue
merit in iavor oi removing the tradi-
vional han on Sunday evening calls.
You all remember these circumstances
periectly. Well, just read this law
which was listed in the catalogues oi
1866—‘67: “Young gentlemen will he
allowed to visit young ladies connects
ed with the college only during the
vacation oi study hours on Saturday
alternoon, except by special permis-
sion oi the faculty." How would you
like to have that rule established to—
dayl Several years later Friday evene
ing was added as an oiiieial calling
time, and it was not until compalar
lively receiltly that Saturday evening
was given over to social purposes.

This is only a sample oithe regular
nous under which the students or
those days lived, The same catalogue
listed a 5 lug oi eighteen laws and
some of them would we h more hard-
ship upon present day students than
the one just quoted, For i stance
this: “The hours from s a nl. to 12
a in. and troni 1 to «ivz and iroin 7 to

average today aiid it takes close econ-
