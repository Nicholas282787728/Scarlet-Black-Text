PRIZE DF $120 IS DEFERED

“Wilson 01' Hughes T” 15 Subject ’l‘llis
Year-Is Iollian’s Thirtl Successi‘e
Time in Merrill DehilI/E#Vet-
emu Tennis Entered.

The sixth annual Merrill Political
Debate will he held in the Colonial
Theater next Monday night at eight
o’clock. The teams that will clash on
the question, "Resolved, That Wilson
Should Be Elected Over Hughes,” are
iroin Ionian and Chi-estomatria liter-
ary societies.

The hleiiill Political Debate was
iounded by the late G. W. Merrill oi
Grinnell. The prize, amounting to
3120 annually, was oitered to interest
Crinnell men in practical politics and
to encourage discussion oi liie politi-
cal questions in the literary societies.
It is awarded ior excellence in debate,
the team presenting the most ctiectivc
debate being the winner.

Coming beiore the night oi elec»
tion, the question will he unusually
interesting Many [acts and sidelights
will be thrown on the present Cains
paign. Both teams are well prepared,
since the socicty trysotlts were held
last spring. In the meantime every
debater has been constantly watching
ior the vital facts in the national cams
paign. >

This is Ionlau's third successive
bier ll debate, that society having won
in the past two years irom both Instr
tute and Forum. Ionian will argue
that Hughes should he elected, and the
Chresto trio will uphold the Denies
cratic nominee

Ellsworth, who originally was a
member oi the Ionian team, has had
to resign his place, and Arlo palmcr
will probably he chosen to succeed
him. Ii th s is done, it will give last
year's winners an allavcturnn tcain.
The two men who helped win ior
Ionian last year are Noel and Van
Dorn. Von Dora, the captain and back-
honc oi the present trio, is equally
good in constructing an argument antl
in delivering it.

Chi-esto ,will be rcprcscnted by
Meek, Larson, and Brown, who will
contend that \\ lson should be elect-
ed. Chresto is handicapped by max
pericnce, but they arc working hard
to put an end to Ioniau’s series or
victories. black and Larson have both
had experience on ircsbinan debating
teams, and Brown in an Intcrsocicty
contest. However, trom every point
or view, this coming contest promises
to he the most interesting in the hist-
ory oi tlic Merrill Debate sorics.

Monday marked the i st indications
oi work on the new moirs dormitories
which are to become a reality in Gr

broke ground tor the new structure.

Preliminary surveys oi the grounds
had been made the last Saturday and
the iield just west oi the grandstand
was ready ioi- excavation work to be-
‘gin carly .llonday morning. Since
then four teams have been continuah

been movcd,

Thc contractors arc having some
diiticulty just at present in getting
enough teams, They have advcr scd
ior additional help and are willing to
pay torty-iivc cents per hour ior coni-

to have all oi the excavation complete

DRAKE 0X SPECIAL TRAIN

It is certain that a huge crowd will
go to Drake on the special train next
Saturday nioiuing. Five or s- hulk
drcd students will probably .ce the
contest, and of these at least two-
thirds will go on the special. A count
taken at Gibbs’ boarding cluh last
Monday shelved that only (ire of about
for boarders will be here Saturday.
It this rate were true throughout the
whole college, there would be over
seven hulldrlzd undergradualc Grin~
iicllians at the Drake Stadium Satin»
dav These could indeed out-yell any
Drake crowd which ever gathered.

Total Vote

Charles Evans Hughes will be the
next President oi the United States,
it the straw vote taken by The Scar-
lct and Black in the Library. yesterday
indicates anything. Hughes received
a total of 261 votes; sixty more than
the 199 hallots cast for the Democrat»
ic nominee, Benson, the Socialist
nominee, sprung into the limelight
with two votes, both cast by men oi
thc student body. A total oi 462 votes
was recorded, twenty-one or these
train the iaculty.
Hughes received a majority from
both the men and women or the Cola
legc. He was the iavoritc oi the men
hy a plurality oi thi y-tivo, and was
given twenty seven more than Wilson
among the girls. The women oi the
Faculty votcd overwhelmingly in his
taror, giiing him eight votes to \Vil<
son's two, but the Faculty men decla
cd themselves for W son, seven to
four. Benson received both his votes
irom student men who insistcd that
his name should be written into tho
ballot.
a straw votc taken at a Faculty
meeting by Dr. Steiner last Monday
altcrnoon i- sultcd in a victory tor
ll'ilson, ton to live. When this is
l'icweil alongside oi the vote oi the
Faculty men in ycstciday's straw bal—
lot, it shows that they are con _ tent»
ly in iavor oi Wilson.
illiilc the vote or tlic men was in
the majority in evcry instance, the
vote oi the women was exceedingly
close, particularly among the Faculty,
where the men polled only eleven
votes to the women's too. The total
student vote was 439, 197 oi tlicsc
cast by the girls, and 212 by the men.
It could not be learned which class
pollcd the greatest number.
Olei' halt the studan body took
part in the voting. This is a much
larger percentage than has takcn p -t
in am or the prcvious elections this
tall at which the College has express
cd my circle Practically twice as
many rates were cast yesterday as at
the Student Council clcction hold two
weeks ago. This is undoubtedly reps
icscntative oi the interest which is
being shown in the national campaign
throughout the state. The polls were
open smell hours, from clgllL o't‘lnck
till three, and ballots bciug
marked almost constantly during that
time.
The interest which has bccn shown

politic among the students this
tall is perhaps due to the orgali‘ .ation
ot the College Republican Club, the
Wilson Club, and the Meredith Club
It is also probably duc to thc citorts
oi the Republicans that such a strong
Republican votc was cast at tho 1)le—
lotiug yostciday.

“Prcxy” wits Glad To Hear
News of Coo Victory.

Although suiiering intense pain
trom his injuries received in the Cole
lision ncar Cedar Rapids lost Satur-
day morning, President Main could not
keep irom smiling when the news oi
Gl'innell’s victory over coc was
brought to him that evening. Coach
MCAImOn and Captain Barrett took
the news in person and extended the
sympathies oi the College.

This Grinncll president is resting at
St. Luke's hospital in Cedar Rapids,
where he was taken immediately aiter
the accident. According to Word irom
Dr. Sprague, who went to Cedar nap-
ids to scc him, he is recovering rapid-
ly and is expecting to return to Grin—
ncll Thursday or Friday. Mrs. Main

will rcmain there until her husband is
able to come home.

The injuiies which Mr. . ain rccciv-
ed in the accident were a broken cola
lar bone and a badly bruised arm.
Both were serious and caused him
much pain.

According to rcports trom Cedar

si ng bciorc tbc interurhan car had
cleared the interscction oi the tracks.
The ireigbt collided with the rear end
or the passenger car, derailing it and
badly smashing the roar vestibule.

With Captain Bar ett laid out with‘
a broken hand, Watt still attected by
theinjury he received at Iowa, and
Schulz limping around on a “game"
leg, the Grinnell backfield is in mis< ,
erablc shape tor the Drake game next
Saturday. There is some hope that
Schulz will recover in time to play at:
Des Moines, hut Barrett probably will
not be able to get into any game until
the Cornell contest. The line is in tine
shape, as there was no one injured in
the'hard game with Coe.

Drake has been preparing all, sea;-
son to retaliate for last year's deieat
oi 58-0 in the hands oi Grinnell. They_
have built up a veiy strong attack.
Last Saturday they played Northwest-
crn to a standstill for the entire iirst‘
hali oi the game, gaining through the
purplc's line at will. The detensc oi
the Bulldogs was weak against the
smashes or such men asDi-iscoll, but
there are icw tcams anywhere that are
impi-egnahle to his attacks. Glaze did .
not suitor an injury against North-
western, and the gamc was an exce1<
lent preparation ior Drake against
Grinncll.

On Lllc‘other liaud, “Mike" Angus-
tine is tbc only inau in the Grinnell
backticld who is not battered or hurt.
With the strong support or Barrett
missing, the hackticld was unable to
play together consistently against
Coe. with Schulz on the sidelines, Day
was placed back at haii yesterday in
the scrimmage against tiic Freshmen.

Fleck, who has been playing at full—
back all year, was sent in at right

team. i

The iorward wall ol Gl'innell's de-

Allnon is how to build up his new
backtield to walk smoothly together
against Drakc. it will require lnuch‘
work this week to put a driving pow-
er into the attack ot Grinncll. In
ordcr to do this, the coach will have
to or augc plays to suit the now back-
iicld.

Harry Grant displayed good [oot~
ball against one in the three quarters
he played, but requires more experi-
ence to till the shoes or Barrett. He
has the ability to hit the line low, and
can play a strong game at. running in-
lericiencc, but has to be polished in
the liner points or thc game in order -
to play "Britt‘s" position correctly. It
