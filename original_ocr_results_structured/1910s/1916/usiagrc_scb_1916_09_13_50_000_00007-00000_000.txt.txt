To adopt his courses to the needs, of
his students is the. plan of Mr. Holmes
Eeckwilll. who has succeeded b -. Le
Deuc in the department or Business
ittliii' ' ration.

Three_eourses are offered this sc~
inester. They arc, (1) Elements of Ac-
counting, (2) Introduction to Business
Law, (a) 't‘rausportatioii, The rirst
of these courses is intended not only
for prospective business men, but for
all who handle funds or manage prop»

fermion the term, in tire home, or
elsewhere. Introduction to Busiue,
Law is designed to be useful to all e.
petting to enter into business l'clzr
tlons. whether as householder, rariir
er, merchant, or in practically any ca»
pacity. Transportation is a study of
methods, means, and economics of
transportation in both domestic and
toreien countries.

Any one of the courses is of practi-
cal use to everyone, as the knowledge
or them is a requisite for almost any
Walk. It is the aiiu of Professor Books
with to treat cach student as individu—
ally in his course or study as possible.
He desires to shape the course to the
probable future occupation of the stu-
dent.

Coming into an agricultural center
Professor Bcoluvitli was surprised
that so few of the students at Grin—
nell desire to take up scientific rarin-
ing. ' He plans to give special Work, if
possible, in farm accounting to those
taking elements of accounting who de-
sii-e to take up scientific farming.
Likewise he will shape the other
courses, when possible, to the future
occupation of the student,

The students who could only take
two hours work instead or three as
the courses requ c, are requested by
Professor Beclzwith to consult with
him and try to arrange a two hour
course tor them.

Ml Beckwim giaduated froin the
University or California in 1908, where
he also held a position as iiistiuetoi- iii
the department or economics and ex-
tension lecturer. l-re was bank exame
iner of the state of California one
year, and during the past year has
been conducting research work {or
the U. 5. Department of Labor.

The college is indeed very fortunate
to secure such an able man as Mr.
Beckwith to supervise the department
or Business Administration, and his
interesting and beneficial courses
should prove very suecessiul.

Miss Vesta Thai-p or Dttuinwa, a
former student in oi-iiiuell College.
wrote a short story during her school
work here, which proved so good that
Scribner-s Publishing Company, to
which she sent it, paid her the sum of
312:, for the right of publication. The
story has not yet been published, but
pmbably will be before long,

 

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

 

A Man is No Older than He Feels

give, and reﬂect in turn,
that sprightliness of spirit
that makes for success and
characterizes successful men.

Collegian Clothes

impart this feeling. They
are typical of the hey-day of
manly endeavor. They are
designed for young men and
men who feel young. They
possess that dash of youth-
fulness that laughs at the
world and triumphs over it.
