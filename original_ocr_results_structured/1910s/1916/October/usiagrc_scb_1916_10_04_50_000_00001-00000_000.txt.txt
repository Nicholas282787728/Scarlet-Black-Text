It has not been decided what are
rangements trill he tirade to do away
with the possibility of scouting at pre—
llnrinary debates, the oatise of the
break in the Quadrangular leag'uc's res
iatioas last March. The matter is now
under consideration by the four-
schools, and it is. possible that rcpt-c»
sentativcs of the Quadrangular ecl—
legos will meet at some central locas
tion in the near futrire tn maltc a final
decision on this and other contested
points.

According to the Coqtracts now in
force, Carleton u ill debate Grinnell on
the home floor the same night that.
Grinnell debates Beloit at Feloit, prob—
ably on Friday, March 16. The other
debates of the evening will be Knox
VS. Carleton at Nol'thlield, and Beloit
vs. Knox at. Galcsbul'g. In each case
the Colleges will have an afﬁrmative
team to defend the question on the
hume floor, and will Send a negative
team lnto the opposing camp.

The Coe-Col‘ucllsGi'inuell dcbates
will take place within a month of the
other series. Cool scheduled to meet
Grinnell here, while we send a team
to Mt, Vernon against Cornell. Coe
also meets Cornell at Cedar Rapids.
It is possible that the affii-niat‘ e

be held jllsl. before the Christmas the
cation, Grinnell has already submits
ter the primary law question as her
choice for the debate but as yet the
other collegcs have not been heard
from.

Last spring an unfortunate situa»
tioir called for the cancellation of
Gl'iuucll‘s debates with Carleton and
Knov. Ten days before the contests
were schodulcd to come off Grtmlell
debated Coo and Cornell on the same
question as was to be used in the
Quadrangulal‘. It was discovered that
Carleton and Knox scnt scouts to these
coirtests to get the Grinncll briefs,

simmediately the lzttcr debates were
cancelled and Grinncll took on Deloit
in a dual affair.

bpon inquir, it was found that both
Carleton and Knox were accustomed
to the pi-aetito ol scouting while Grill»
nell anti licloit were not. It was an
unfortunate mistrnderstaudiug that
cotild not have been easily foresecn.
This year the Debating Union hopes
to take some steps toward a detinitc
understanding upon the mattor of
scouting,

A crowd of about fire lruhdrod Dear
bio heard Senator Geo. W. No -is of
Nebraska speak at the Colonial Thcas
tcr last Saturday night.” ilc came here
under the auspices of the Grinch
Collegc Republican Club.

Mr. W. G. Ray called the meeting
to order and turned over the chair to
President Kallelllifrck of the club, who
presided during tho remainder of the
evening. The Men's Glee Club Quar-
tctte sang “America" and “Iowa,”
which worc heartily applauded. Dur~
his the mooring, members of the Re-
publican Club occupied places on the
platform.

Senator Norris proved to be one or
the most convincing of political speaks
ers that have come to Grinnell. Hav-
ing been a progressive, sometimes an
independent, and now a republican in
the Senate, he was able to offer valu-
able criticisms of the acts of both the
Republican and Democratic parties
during the last four years.

Cl'iﬁt'iso: Delllucl'nts.

Particularly, though, did he criti-
6120 the Democratic party for not
keeping their platform plcdges of four
years ago. lie gave considerable cir-
lightenment tipcir the caucus system
of that party in which its rules enable
as few'as fifteen democrats to con-
trol tlre vote of tho ltillelyss mombers
of the senate. This he said was iii
part responsible for some of the obs
ieotionable legislation which has been
recently enacted.

Considerable time was spent by Sells
ator Norris in discussing the tariff is—
sues. ile said that the democratic law
of the last four yoars was of such a
nature that it drove the monopolies
out of America but was helpless to
regulate tllcm abroad. lie also showed
how under the Underwood Tariff law
the total exports decreased cvc ,
mouth boforc the war while the lmv
ports increased iii the same period.

c oisnr of the democrats for irot
keeping their part- pledge in regard
to trust legislation, was likowise made.
He showed how they had enacted a
law which had no penalty attached and
consequently could be of little value
as a statute.

Led by their new captain, Witmer,
the Freshman squad under the coach-

lifc and is lurnishing the varsity some
real scrimmage practice. Yesterday
the Freshn‘len offered as stiff opposi—

With the opening game otit of the
way, the Soar-lot and Black squad is
being pointod for the contest with
Simpson Saturday. The scarlet and
block came out or the fray last week
without scriorts iiuitrlcs to airy mem-
ber of the squad. Osgood is limping
on a "game" log, btit trill be in shape
to battle against the "Siinps" with the
same fight that ire displayed againsi'
Leander Clar

With coaches Jones and Kent, and
Trainer Watson of Iowa looking on
the plays, Grillnell did not open up
against Leander Clark. Fumbles that
would have proved costly in a tight
gamo marred the exhibition of the
scarlet and black team. On two occa-
sions within the shadow of the goal
posts the ball was fumbled, the result
of poor playing on the part of several
members of the squad. The other
noticeable flakes were the many for
ward passes which failed to make
good. At one time, three of these in
succession went incomplete or into
the hands of the opponents, the last of
which almost resulted in a touchdown
for Leander Clai .
