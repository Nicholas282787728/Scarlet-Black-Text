DO YOU W ‘T A SEAT?

when Josef Hoimun, the next linin-
her on the School oi 'hlusic Recital
Course comes, a new predicament will
arise.

There are now just 752 seats in the
Chapel, not including those on the
platform which would he more or less
unsuitable tor recital purposes. The
College office has already issued m
semester lee tickets. The question

Usually it will not happen that all
users of semester ices uill care to go
