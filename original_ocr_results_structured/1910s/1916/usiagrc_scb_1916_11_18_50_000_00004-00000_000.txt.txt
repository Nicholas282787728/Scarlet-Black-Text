Word has just been received of the
untimely death or Dr. . H. Bockluall,
'04, at his homo in Rochester, Minue-
sota.

Local physicians who knew Dr.
Bcclnnan state that he was oi-innelrs
iorcmost medical alumnus. lie was an
authority on the diagnosis of smallpox
and was especially skilliul in rerreting
out and isolating sources of infection
in diphtheria, scarlet fever and' ty—
phoid lever.

His honors were numerous. At the
time or his death Dr. Ecclnnan was 8.
meinher. or the Minnesota Academy or
hleilicinc, Colorado State Medical So-
ciety, American Medical Association.
and the American Surgical Association
hesidcs several local and state organ-
lzittions. He was also Professor of
Surgery on the Mayo Foundation 01
the University or Minnesota.

Dr. Bochman became ill on October
31, with an infection or staphylococus
pyrogcnes anreus. The infection
spread to the nasal septum and other
structures or the head, became gen—
eral, causing his death on November
7, his disease was not due to the in-
{action alone, but to the strchnoos
work of a none too strong physique.

Dr. Eccklllall graduated from crin-
iicll College in 1394. Aiter teaching
a icw years he entered the liedical De—
partment or the University or Minnee
sotn, graduating in 1001. Since grad»
hating he has been assistant liaclcriolo—
gist in the laboratory of the llinucsoto
state Board or liealth, city physician
oi Minneapolis, and lust assistant to
Dr. c. n. Mayo.

The rise or Dr. Beckmall has hccii
very rapid. At the time or his death
he was head of Surgical Section Four
lot the Mayo Clinic at the Mayo Hosp
[Al in Rochester. His field included
the correction of delormities of the
peso and mouth, operations on the
throat and lungs and operations [or
