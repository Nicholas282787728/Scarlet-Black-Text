Argument based on Public
Welfare Idea.

Institute and Ionian will meet next
Friday afternoon in debate for the
championship oi the College as the
result of the preliminary contests held
Wednesday and Thursday nights. The
former will have the negative and
Ionian the affirmative or the Compul-
sory Arbitration question. Chresto
meets Forum during the preceding at.
ternoon in the consolation debate of
the series,

Institute and Ionian were both win—
ners of their contests last Wednesday
and Thursday nights. The former dc-
feated Chresto in a close contest and
Ionian easily outargued the Forum
men.

First Debate “'35 Close.

The InstituteChi-esto contest last
Wednesdaynight was far more close
than the 3 to o decision for Institute
might show. The winners presented
an old-fashioned case supported by
old arguments, but it proved good
enough to win a decision, Clii-esto, on
the other hand, must he given CrediL
for originating a new case with whicti
they came very near to a victory.

Meek Is Best.

The best speech of the whole even—
ing was undoubtedly given by Meek.
He was unusually forceful and his sin-
cerity went a long way towards mak-
ing his work very effective. He had
the skillful facility of repeating the
word “impractical" until his audience
almost believed him, Miller, for In.
stitute, gave an unusually brilliant
summary in rebuttal which went a
long way towai s giving his society
the decision. Far er and Arlnllrnstel‘
also did good work for Institute and
Clark and Gilbei'g for Chresto.

Ionian Wins 3 To 0.

Basing its argument on the state-
ment that the publiL should be prOr
teeted against the whims of the rail-
road employes, Ionian Society, upr
holding the affirmative, defeated For-
um in the first round of the inter
society debate series by it 3-0 decision,
Thursday evening.

“The greatest good to the greatest
number" argument of the affirmative
was a Winning factor, While Forum’s
digression from the subject of railr
roads and their cmployes undoubtedly
contributed to its defeat. Both sides
presented plans which advocated the
use of military force as a. last resort.
The negative, while advocating force
if voluntary arbitration failed, held a
compulsory board to be un-Americah.
The affirmative declared that as cams
pulsion must be used, the permanent
board was the most economical and
just means. On the question of pride»
ticability, both sides cited examples,
and one of these used Was in different.
phases by both negative and affirmnr
tive.

Ellsworth mid hricrly Star.

The Ionian team was composed of
Palmer, '17, Noel, '18, and Ellsworth,
’19. Ellsworth starred in rebuttal,
presenting his refutation: in 3. clear,
ctfective manner, Nocl's speaking
was powerful throughout.

Gould, ’17, Brierly, '20, and Riley,
'20, represented Forum.

Trevor Ai'nett, auditor of Chicago

From ltere Mr. Arnett went to Drake,

The idea of The Grillllcll College
Foundation, the auxiliary corporation
which issued bonds for the $300,000
Womens Quadrangle last year, and
which is now financing a similar dor-
mitory group for the men, was of par—
ticular interest to Mr. Arnctt. He gave
thc plan his unqualified endorsement,
and called it a distinctive advance in
college financial methods. It could be,
adopted by other colleges with con»
sidciable success, he thought. Mr. Ar--
nett said be had heard consider-able
about the "Crinnell plan" as he called
it, 'in different parts of the country,
and so was particularly curious to pay

Instant popularity attended the ap-
pearance of the College Orchestra at
the Chapel last night in the first of a
cries of four public concerts to be
[given this winter, The small but en-
thusiastic audience which was present
found the idea of the Music Festival
Association so plausible that six enr
cores were necessary to satisfy it.
Five of these were rendered by Franz
Wagner of Chicago, 'cellist, who was
the special soloist of the evening, and
one by the orchestra itself.
ii esler Piece Is Favorite.

Mr Wagner’s playing was evidently
much in favor with the audience. By
far his most popular number was
"Liebesfreud" by Fritz Kreisler. This
was the some piece that Gllnnell heard
played by the noted violinist himself
some threc or four years ago, and Mn
.Wagner's reiiditinn of it compared very
favorably with that 01 Kreisler. Last
night he showed excellent expression
of a temperamental kind as well as
ard, Mrs. Pierce proved an excellent
accompanist for him. '

Orchestra Well Receilcd.

The first appcarance of the College
Orchestra this season was a very cred-
ilahle’showing. It seemed to meet
with very popular favor and Grinnell
people are anticipating more concerts
of the kind heard last night. The or»
ganization, which now totals forty-two
members, showed a wonderful im.
provement in technique over what it
has presented heretolore. A greater
confidence and sincerity of purpose is
also more evident. Melodies could still
Ibe brought out with more contrast and
a program of more popular music
could be offered. but these are changes
to home with more experience. The
next concert is awaited wrtb much in.
terest.

Especial mention must be made or
the most excellent way in which the
orchestra rendered lhq‘ Schubert over--
ture, "Magic Harp," This, the last
number on the program, was easily
the best. The three German dances
were also well received and the last'
of these, the Torch Dance, who on»
cored. Mr. Wagner played as cncorea,
“Polonaise," by Popper, "lit-strianI

nell Men Praised.

At this time of year when the "light
occupation" of every sports writer
consists of choosing mythical eievehs
to represent a state or conference, it
is inter sting to note the all-star elev-
clls ol the Iowa. Conference as picked
by Vern Hinkley in the Evening Ga-
zeitc of Cedar Rapids, that city which.
is the stronghold of so many Coe and
Cornell supporters.

Grinnell heads the list with seven
men, four on the first [Balthigﬂliety‘
Osgood, Barrett. and Augustine, and
three on the second selectionismith,
Gingles, and watt, Barrett is further
honored by being given the captaincy
of the allsCOnIerellCe Lenin, five iron]
One, two from Highland Park, and one
each from Simpson and Parsons. SIX
Cornell men are also given places.

Due To Efficient Coaching.

The Gazette speaks very highly of
the work of all the conference teams,
and reaches the conclusion that the
degree of excellence attztlllcdais due to
“an abundance of efficient coaching
and likewrse to an overflow of grid-
iron material which may be ranked as
sensational,"

In discussing the individual men
who made the all.Confei-encc teams,
the Gazette gives considerable atten-
tion and pratse to the seven scarlet
and black men selected. Martin, guard,
who was placed on the all-Iona see-
oiid team by the Des Moines Capital,
is seemingly overlooked. In speaking
of the ends, the Gazette reniai

“Two men in the conference stand
out above all others. They are Raf<
fcty of Griiiiicll and l<resciishy of Coe.
The former inade his team's only
