“I have never known before how in-

how eager they are to get accurate
information on all the changing move
ments that underlie the physical and
spiritual development of the college"

afternoon.

were eager to get the judgment of
alumni on certain movements in Grin»

information regarding the spiritual and
material development of the college.
[I has simply an effort to acquaint
the alumni with the college uprmr
