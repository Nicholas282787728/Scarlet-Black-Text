Grinnell Marvel Will Compete in
Missouri Valley and "Big
Nine” Meets Before
End of Season,

The State Meet today, although the
last clash GrinnellV will have with
Iowa colleges, is not the conclusion of
the present season, but represents the
climax of work for the entire 1916

sound. The season has been the most,

successful in the prominence gained
by wearers of the Maltese cross in
many years.

Two big classics remain, after the
meet in Des Moines today. in which
Coach Huff will enter representatives
for —Grinnell, the Missouri valley
Meet at. Colunlmbia a week from tos
day, and the Western Conference
classic at Chicago, June 3.

The scarlet and black track coach
plans to enter; Hoyt, the Grinneil cap-
tain and crack sprinter. in both the
Missouri valley and “Big Nine" meets.
and also expects to send a mile relay
quartet to tire iornrer- event.

The personnel of the long relay {mil-
is not yet determined and probahly
will not he announced for another
week or more. It i conjectured, ha“?
over, that Hoyt will be the fotlrtll plan
or the quartet, and illift hopes to take
down a team whicii will make 2 cred-
itable showing.

The present reason has been an un-
tlilestioiled come-hack for Grinncli in
track, and after the relatively poor
showing made in this sport during the
past two years the season's Work has
been a surp se to the state at large.

The feature of the season was un-
doiihtedly the \lClOl in the Confer--
ence Meet at Cedar Rapids a week ago.
although the \rctory oior Drake
the annual dual meet certain , go
down on record as a memorable ciciit,
inasmuch as Drake has iron from
Gi-inriell rather consistently in the
past few tlccad

in the CollIei'encC cl 'r Huff pror-
ed conclllsh ly that he had a well—
balanced team, as the Gi'l'nllcll records
in all the events showed, and the com

'mon belief held by a few ctlrsrgcoh

leges that Grinnell-s team revolved
around an indrridual star, was thor-
oughly shattered. In the D ake dual,
a record or f . s in erery r-acc i _
Grinnell is one which local enthusi-
asts point to with price.

The Carleton defeat was rather a
surprise to Gririncil followers, put it
has been recognized that eleven men
is a small hunch to take a meet
against a larger and uell-halanced ag»
gregation.

1n the state iieet today, Gr-rnnell
hopes to wind up a successful season
with at least a third place, and in
such an event Huff’s men will be l'ecs
ognized as one of the best college
teams in the west.

Prospects ior next year are a little
uncertain, hut it the present athletes
return to College, Huff ought to put a
s onger- team m the running than he
had ever heiore, it the Coach is able
to unearth some winning candidates
in the weights and jump, Grrnnell will
appear s one or the strongest con-
tenders -in the state classic 2. year

“Old Joe Gllmm” played a stel-
lar role in the Gi'mllellsCol'nell hattle
on Ward Field yesterday afternoon,
and Grinnell's 1»tl victory guinrued up
the claims to the state title con<
siderahly. As things stand now, times
has heaten Grinnell twice, Cornell and
Iowa have deteatcd each tithe" once.
Grinnell and Cornell have shared hon<
ore, Iowa has whipped Amos. and
Grinneli and Iowa have yet to c oss
bats.

The outstanding feature of ychlel'<
day' game was the work of one
“ch Schultz on the mound for Grin<
hell. For nine innings he outsguessed
the Cornell sticker and only once did
one of tile opposition nick him for a
hit. Twelve Cot'nellltes were set back
by the Strike-out route. and the wily
Schultz refused to provide a single
free pass to rust base. His work
with men on the bases was exceptions
ally good. in the screnth framc with
l3yerly on sccontl base and none out,
Schultz whrlfcd the next three bats-
men, _

Grinnell's lone tally cairic in the-
eighth act. With two down Macy got
hold of a inst one and drove it to left
center for three sac) Little then
coritr' uted thc ireccssa single wrth
a liner over short, and Macy rornped

which eillicl side got a man post sec-
