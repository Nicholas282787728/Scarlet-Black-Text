Well as the scrap itself. However,
this- plan was given up because the
committee did‘nut have the time to
map out a good enough program of
entertainment; Consequently, they i —
sorted to the old system or tie-up

Officials have been chosen and all

the case last year, the Freshmen will
be given thirty-tire minutes in which

this period it any Sophomores remain
untied, the ’19~C|‘s will be declared
victors ol the contest. The burden is
thus placed upon the Freshmen be-
cause they have superior numbers.
