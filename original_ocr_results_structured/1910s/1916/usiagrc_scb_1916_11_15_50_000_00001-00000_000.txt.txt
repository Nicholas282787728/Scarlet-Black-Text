the following afternoon between the
winners of the lust series. All the
debates Will take place in the society
balls with the exception of the final,
which will be held either in the Chapel
or in the auditorium of the new Alum—
ni Recitation Building.
Arbitration Is Question.

The question to be dismissed this
year is “Resolved, That a Permanent
Arbitration Board with Compulsory
Powers Should Be Established To Set
tle Disputes Between Stcain Railway
Companies Doing Interstate Business
and Their Euiploycs, Constitutionality
Granted.” ThiS question will be used
later in the varsity debates.

A great deal of interest has been
shown in the series this Year. It has
been necessary for Forum to hold two
preliminaries because oi the large
number who wished to try out. For
this reason the debates bid fair to he
as hotly contested as an)‘ which have
been held in recent years. Several of
last year's Honor “G" men who are
still in School will probably take part
sometime during the series, and an
abundance of Freshman material is
said to be available.

will Award ll. 0. Ray l’r

Tile llltersociety debates are partic-
ularly important in tho llllllibet‘ of
points they give toward the “'ul‘th
Trophy cup which is awarded at the
end of the year to the sociciy which
has made the best record ill all phases
of its war . The soclctlct receive [ur-
[hci‘ credit for every member that they
place on all intercollegiate debating
tean].

One feature of interest in the inter-
society series will he the awarding of
the \V. 0. Ray prize [or the second
time. It consists of a series of amounts
which are given to Institute men only
and is tliils an llitrasomety aflail'. The
cash prizes which will be given out
will depend upon the success of the
individual men on the Institute teams,
all added amount going to them for
each victory and for success in rivalr—
ing the varsity debate team, This is
the only prize which is offered within
a socicty [or excellence in individual
work.

Merrill Ari)“ sell Interest.

The lierr-ill debate of last week, in
which Ionian triumphed over Chi-csto,
aroused the year's debating spirit. it
was the first time that a society team
had won the licrrill prize three years
in succession.

The intercollegiate teams will be
picked at the close or the series lronr
the inter-society debaters avid othcrs,
so that work can begin immediately
alter the holidays in preparation tor
the debate with color-ado Collcgc in
February. The debate schedule also
includes a triangular scrics ol debates
with Coe and Cornell in March, anti a
dual debate with Beloit.

Those elected were chosen irorn an

eaucics would not permit villus. Jiarly
Slimled the results or diligent study
of news writing and of serious cliort
to satisfy the requirements of good
work. In general, the vvo of the
men easily surpassed that oi the vvo»
men, possibly because it happened
that they were more laminar 'tli the
standards required in rcpor-lorial work.

Although a law who entered the try
out did not, as usual, linislr with all
their material handed in, let those
one did complete the requirements

was possibly a little more llitficillt
than heretofore, but it was in keeping
u ith the increased standards or news»
writing which have been inquired oi
the stall lately.

At its mccting yesterday the stall

is expected that the new slructurc

manager for the college, said yester-
day that all citorts arc being made to
complete thc work by that time.

Failure or building materials to
live when needed is largely rcsponsi

tion oi the building. Labor is gener-

could employ a larger [area or inch,

L LIST

The game which was to have been
hold in Gi-iiinell next Saturday be-
tween the scarlet and black and Penn
Collage, has been called ofl, according
to word just received. Instead, “Doc"
Huli’ has arranged for the Varsity to
meet the Freshmen on Ward Field at
the same time as the other contest was
to have been held,

The reason which the Penn athletic
authorities ascribe to the cancellation
is that too many of their team are laid
up with injuries and two are ineligible
from studies. It seems that the Cor-
nell contest of last week was or trying
one on the neighboring college, and as
a result they have a long hospital list.

Expected liar-d Gan'ic.

Penn has shown some very good
football in hcr games so far, and Grill-
nell enthusiasts were looking for a
hard game next Saturday. The rear oi:
the Quakers in holding Drakc to a
seven point score earlier in tire’season
made a cousidcrablc impression here.

The change in plans permits “Doc”
Hull to give the Freshmen a good
game, a thing which he has been try-
ing to arrange for them all fall, He
has relt that the first year men de-
served some such recognition in re-
