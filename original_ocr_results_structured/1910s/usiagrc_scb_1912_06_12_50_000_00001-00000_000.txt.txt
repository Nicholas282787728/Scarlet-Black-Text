NADE REMAIN,

Grinnell’s Commencement has been.
larger and more interesting this year
than before. Class reunions
have been better attended, class "pep~
has been more in evidence and the
Commencement list oi
alumni is the largest in the history
or the institution.

so enthusiastic have the old grads
become over their return to their All-u.
Mater that the students pt the present
generation have been compeiled to “sit
up and take notice." The classes oz
’82, '92’ and '02 particularly have dis-
played a remarkable spirit while the
more recent graduates oi '11 and '09
have helped to lend an air of gniety,
to the Commencement iestivi es.
