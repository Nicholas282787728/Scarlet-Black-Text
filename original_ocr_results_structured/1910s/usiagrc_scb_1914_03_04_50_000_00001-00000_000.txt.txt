Tire men are being given a rest trorn
the hard game last week, and should
be ill a position to put up the best ex~
llihition of basket ball oi the season in
the ﬁnal contest, since lowa retuses

The \isitors irom Lincoln will line
doubtedly present one at the imtest
tires that ever played on the local door
and can be counted on to make an
unusual showing in the iarorite indoor
snort. They hold the same basketball
superiority in their own state that
Grinnell holds iii Iowa and have been
able to produce all exceptional quintet
this year.

Valley Title at stake.

The past season has been rery satis-
tactoi-y tor the Nebraskans and they
will enter the thinned cauip as the

It means the Missouri valley honors
