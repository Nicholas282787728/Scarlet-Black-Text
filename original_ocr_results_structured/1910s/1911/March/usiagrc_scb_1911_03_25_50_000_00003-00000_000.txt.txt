The game of basket ball started in
Grinncll with the erec on of the Men's
Gymnasium, and In this sport as in all

athletics Grinncll and the State Uni-

ies, so that Gi-innell had the best claim
on the college championship iii 1303,
althe losing two out of three games to
the Des Moincs Y. M. C. A. ﬁre, it
was during this year that the Univel”
sity of Wisconsin defeated Grinncll, on
the letters ﬂoor by olie point. The
common opinion about this game seems
to be that both teams played their ot-
ﬁcials, and that the Wisconsin referee
kept better track or the time and won
the game for his team by calling the
last foul. Tlle following Year a return
game was played at Madison and ti
game was again lost altho by a vet
close score.

During the same year, 1904. four
games were played with Iowa, three of
which resulted in victories for the
University team. For the second and
last time Iowa defeated Grinnell on
the latter‘s floor.

During the years 1905 and 1906 A. n.
Wilder, ’06, was captain oi Gi'lnnell's
team, and under his leadership Grin-
iieli developed a system or piay which
has been maintained tronl that time
on. By using signals and a system or
blocking, team play has been pcriocted
which has enabled Grillnell to more
than hold her own against all teams
which she has played. Only once dur-
ing the past seven years has the state
championship gone to any other iowa
school. a record which has given Grin
hell the undisputed supremacy in tins
line or athletics.

Another factor which has in a very
large degree contributed to Grinhell's
success in basketball has been the an-
uual series of inter~clnss basketball

Such a record without a deieat on

total of only 26 defeats in 10 years is
certainly an enviable one and we only
hope that inturc athletes who repre-
