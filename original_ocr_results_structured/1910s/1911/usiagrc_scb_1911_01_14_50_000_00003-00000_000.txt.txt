There is consider-aide complaint
from those in charge at the various
lectures, recitals, and athletic contests
regarding the use, or rather, the laclt

large irumhei or students ll‘dte lallcn
into the lrahit or not presenting these
tickets tor admission and take it as a
personal arlrorrt it those in atelidance
at the door raise any question uhout
adorning them.

There has been some lnis-llse ot SeV
mester Fee piivrleges this year in the
matter or ti-ansrerring them; and oth-
ers not holding season tickets have the
heir advantage or the disregard ol‘ the
rule requiring them to he presented at
the door, and have gained t‘ree adinis
sion to various gmes and entertain
merits. This rubs the several outside
activities or a considerable turrount ol‘
revenue which they depend upon to de-
troy a part ot the expense.

From now on the rules are going to
he more strictly ohseried, and ticltcts
must he presented. it is to he hoped
that students and lacultt \\l|l cooper»
(11.0 in the matter and make it as easy
as possihlc {or those in charge to he»

isn't asking very nruch OK you, and ll
may menu a good deal to the various
