You sro, D. s.. it rather dorolves upon

instance, since you are advocating the

prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
your plan (whatever it is) is hotter
lharr the present one, and would more
near-l approximate the "ideal" in its

Just to make it oasier tor you, D. S.,
you rrright take those things into your
consideration at tho last proposition;
that your plan would ﬁrst. either pro-
ride a hotter paper than the present

MCDONALD TREATS HOBBIES

Deﬁnes Necessity of Single Aim
for Efficient Life.

“Hobbies," was the subject tolren by
McDollaltlatY,1L1‘Ilursﬂaylllgllt, nu
his general topic was Usefulness. Last
rear the Independent asked its readers
who were the ten ruost useful Anlerir
cans, and McDonald brieﬂy reviewed
somc oi llie answers which were re
ccired in response to this query. In
nearly every instance the men who
were chosen where men who had learn—
ed to do some ouc thing well, and thus
these men ercluplihcd tho answer to
tile conundrum or liieito learn to do
at lcast one thing well.

Among the ten who receive the lliglr
est number- oi votes, there was not Due
montloncd who had done his l\ol'k m
the ticld or r-cligrou, art, or pirilos
on! However, this be in a
large measure explained by the tact
that whereas some got rccogmtlou
others doing just as useiul a Work get
no recognition.

Tile second thing to be noticed in
this list was that the man who obtains
ed recognition wore the men who had
made themselles the most ctticicnt,
'l‘hc runir who received the highest
numbor oi votes was Thomas Edison.
He is a good example or a man who
has llnd a lrohhy and has “lode” it all
the tune. He once told a newspaper
mu- who asked him about the secret or
his success that the secret of any
man's success was to concentrate on
one thing tor eighteen hours a day.

in ay

This is not only the secret of success

in Hie business llorld but ill the relis-
ious world as well; to succeed we must
[like up one line or religious work and
learn to do it Well.
