S. G. L. Board Makes
Several Changes

Honor_System Succeeds Proctor:—
Secretoryv'l‘akes Minors:

The “‘omcll’s League is working out
a new experiment in strident govern-
ment in the lor-nl ol the “honor 51157
tour," The old proctor system has
been discarded and responsibility is
placed in tire hands or all the women,

Under the new plan each individual
keeps a record or her own lninors for
lights alter hours and loollouts. These
are handed to the Cottage secretary at
the regular heuscrneetings called every
to weeks. The secretary hands her
record to some member of the League
Board.

A new feature in the system is the
plan regarding the evening study
lroirrs. in cacti cottage one girl is
appointed by the House chairman eve
c‘ry week to be responsible [or the

hours.
