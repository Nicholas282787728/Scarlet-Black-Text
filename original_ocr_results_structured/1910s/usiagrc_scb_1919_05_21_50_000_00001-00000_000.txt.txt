Now that the war has come to a
close and the last liberty loan has
been successfully floated, it is he-
colnlng possible to compile correct ﬁg-
ures and data on Grinnell‘s part in the
conflict and to organize her war rcc-
ord, This work is being under-taken
by Prof. C. E. Payne and all records
of Gl'inncll’s achievements are being
gathercd so that a complete and per—

manent record may be kept and ﬁled
showing in detail the different pro-
iects undertaken by the college, slur
dents, and graduates.
Represented In Every Branch.

Some very interesting facts have
been brought to light in looking over
the record, as so far completed. Grin-
nell has has aprominent part in every
drive for enlistments, for the multi—
tude of war funds, in liberty loan
drives, in Red Cross work She ranks
high in number of men in service, in
percentage or men commissioned. and
of faculty members in service in this
country and abroad. Men from Grin-
nell could be round in nearly every
camp in the country. and in every
branch of the service.

The infantry claimed the largest
quota with a total or 99, the held artil-
lery and medical corps running a. close

 

race for second with so and 79 respccr
tively. Other branches were l‘eprer
sented proportionately.

In addition to those in the lighting
.uuits there were 23 Grinncllians in the
,Itcd Cross, 25 in the Y, M. C. A. work.
‘ztntl 23 in are War Camp Community
Service. Including all these there are
a total of 622 service stars on the flag,
and 01 these a total or 151 men are
commissioned. As near as has been
discovered so far, 18!) men were ovci»
seas. Besides these mentioned 25c men
enlisted in the s. A, T. C. in Grinncll,
which brings the grand total to 878 in
Ithe service. (if this number 21 gold!

Over the Top In Loans.

The record of pledges to the various
war funds and loans is not complete,
as yet. To the secdnd liberty loan
$11,200 was subscribed, and to the
fourth loan a subscription of $12,050
was made by the men. No record was
kept of the womeirs subscriptions.
Perhaps the best record was made in
the United Wnr Work campaign, to
which a subscription of $10,868.15 was
made, oversnbscribing our quota of
$7,170 by over 53,000, and hanging up
a record of third in the schools of
Iowa, The record of 100% Red Cross
membership is also one ol which Grin-
nell may be proud.
