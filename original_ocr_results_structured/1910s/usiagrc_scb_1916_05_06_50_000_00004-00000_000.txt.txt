Upset Dope.

In the iii-st rounds in the Annual
Interolass Tennis Tournament )1er
oh the College courts yesterday, the
Juniors took first honors, winning
more than twice as many points as
any other class.

Last night the score stood as fol-
lows: Juniors, 7 points; Sophomores,
3 points; Freshmen, 2 points. The
Seniors as yet have tailed to make a
score, and it looks as it they were out
ox the race almost entirely. The
Sophs, however, may crowd the lead-
ers hard and possibly will tie them in
the ﬁnal moments at the contest this
arternoon.

Parsons and Swan, the Junior dour
oles team, showed up especially well
yesterday and loolt good enough to
take the doubles championship. They
won trom both Seniors and 8017110»
mores and today will have little. difﬁv
culty in delealing \Vbeelock and Mc-
Donald of the Freshmen. The Pottles,
who are playing singles this year, iron
both of their matches yesterday, and
probably will he close contenders for
the singles chaiupionshm.

The results or i sterdey's matches
were:

Parsons and Swan vs. Elsele and
