While Ml hoycs is filst a poet and
secoiidaii . a reader, yet his inteipre~
tation oi the poems he read was ex—
cellent. Slightly handicapped in; a
voice which, while pleasant to hear, is
not that oi a. trained reader, he carried
the audience completely with him by
the music ot his poetry, so that when
his program was complete, he was in-
sistently encored for more.

Mr Noyes brought out the romantic
and lyrical qualities oi his poetry even
to a greater degree than would lie re<
iealed h. its study. His poetry is
strong and rigorous, such as a young
man and athlete would write. while
typical oi the age in which he lives,
set it introduces a strain of the Vic-
torian which is iiill ol oeanty and ape

audience. The singing duality oi the
