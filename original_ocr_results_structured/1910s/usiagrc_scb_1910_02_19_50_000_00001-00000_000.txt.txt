The second annual Colonial Hall was
hcld last evening at the gymnasium un-
der the management oi the board of di-
rectors oi the w. A, A. The dance,
which was attended by practically ev-
ery girl in school, presented a brilliant
spectacle, as demure hilt beantiiull
gowncd maidens tripped the measures
or the light rantastic on the aims of
ooilriiy p rilegcd gentlemen.

Tile ilali was decorated with great
rings aiid hunting and streamers oi the
red, white and blue. Frappe was serilr

Promptly at ton-thirty the home

maids and men went home to put away
their ﬁncry until another February.
Tile prominence which this social
