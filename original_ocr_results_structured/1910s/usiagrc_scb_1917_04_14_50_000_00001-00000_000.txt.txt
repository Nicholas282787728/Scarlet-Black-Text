0' Council Says i‘ouudniion Does

Tonight at the meeting of the, city
council, sitting as a board ol 1 view,
it will bc decidcd whether or not all
the productive property of Giinliell
College in this city will be assessed
for taxation. The propcriy‘affccccd,
in case the taxation order is given,
will include the Women's Quadrangle.
the Men's Quadrangle when completed,
and other holdings in the city which
produce revenue.

The council is acting upon the the
cry that these properties; which her
long to the Grinnell Foundation, are
subject to taxation because they pro—
duce revenue. The council claims that
the state law which exclnpls colleges
and some other institutions, does not
cover the Foundation.

the respective teams have begun in
earnest the task of rounding their ma-
terial into shape in order to secure an
early lead over their rivals. Practice

tirely to the central 'cannpus, but it is
expected that the teams will take turns
in a few days working out on the dia-

iuer Years, the championship will he

Contracts for two diamonds were let

the intercollegiate games in May and

park at that location, but plans for
this will not be definitely settled until
next yenr.

An entirely new system has been de

”In all probability diplomas will be
given to all seniors who leave college
to enlist in some military service,"
said President Main yesterday. “The
faculty have taken no uliicial action
on the matter yet, but I shall recom—
mend that we use the'utmost consider—
ation in any such cases."

If any underclnssmeu enlist the ad~
ministration will endeavor to give
them credit for all work done during
the semester. '

In an effort to find out What advice
would be given to a student who was
considering enlisting at the present
time, a number of prominent facility
men in different departments were in—
Lervlewed, andlmost of them had no
hesituncy in expressing their views.

"Business as usunl," declared. Pro-
fessor Bailey of the political science
department. "Under the present sliu-

We students must be rational. At

on to military drill. but we should con--
tilllle our college work to the end of
the year. It is possible that by sum»
mer the government will have more
definite plans. and will need us in the
army. Then we must all go."

E J, Jaqlla, junior dean of men, is
