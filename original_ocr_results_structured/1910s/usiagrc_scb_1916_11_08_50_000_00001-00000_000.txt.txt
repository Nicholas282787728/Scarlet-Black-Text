Chi-cstomathia was rcprcs‘ctitcd by
Walter block, ’18, Ernest Larson, '15,
and Sol Gilbcrg, 'id. The lonian team
was composed of Harold Van Dol'nt
'13, Homer Noel, ’18, and Ben BITS--
worth, '19. The Chrcstomathia team
was somewhat weakened by the loss
of Roy Brown, who received a condi-
tion in last week's exams, thus being
deprived of participation in the do-
hate. ‘ ,

Homer Noel was eas y the star ior
lonian in the constructive speeches,
making a stirring denunciation of the
president's Me 'cail policy, and win-
ning applause with his heated declal'»
etion that “peace still rages iii Mex
ico."

Walter Meek tirade the best con~

sn-uctiro speech for Chi-csio, arid also
excelled in rebuttal, although nearly
equaled by his leamslnates. The hol1~
ors in rebuttal ior icnian were pretty
iairly divided, with Ellsworth and Van
Dorn having a slight edge in effects

t Gilberg, the first speaker for Chi'es-
to, had had hiit twenty-tour hours to
prepare tor the contest, yet he deliw
cred an excellent main spccch and
was effective in rebuttal. He argued,
as first speaker, that the legislative
record of President Wilson deserved
the continuance in power oi the denr
oer-ats.

Ellsworth ioi ionian spoke oi the
d astroiis tree trade record or the
democrats, and showed how that party
had disregarded its platform pledges.
in continuing the affirmative case
Larson discussed the iinancial and
commercial legislation passed by the
present administration, speaking na’
ticularly of the federal trade commi.
sion, the income tax, and the iedcral
reserve law. _

Noel made one of the nrost effective
speeches of the evening in criticizing
the pl'csident' domestic and foreign
aitaii-s. He scored the secret caucus
which resulted in legislative control
by a few senators and representatives,
and spoke against the newly enacted
eight-hour law. He treated the diplos
matte policy iti relation to Germany
wrth scorn, and iii an vcr to the “He

president \l'ilsun has a lead in elcc-
torul totes, according to reports l'es
ecircd at noon today from the Western
Ulllou, Postal Telegraph, Associated
Press, and United Pro s.

With tour slates yct to report, the
\t'estcrn Union gare Wilson 242 and
Hughes 216 iii tltc college. Ollie, one
of the states that had iiot rcported,
has been practically conceded to XV'iIs
son by the Republican National Coin-
inittec.

The Postal sent out word that \Vll»
son was assured of 255 and Hughes
293 votes, with forty votes undecided.
The United Press in its latest flash
places the race still closer, conceding
243 to Wilson and 243 to Hughes, with
Caliiornia, Minnesota,, w Humps
shire, I\ w Mexico, Oregon and \Vyollp
ing doubtful. The Associated Press
has telegraphed practically the same
results.

According to the early reports last
night the Republican National Com-
mittee claimed that Hughes was elect-
cd, but late reports from the western
states which were thought to be for
Hughes, tut-tied out to have gone for
Wilson. The election has upset dope
in all parts of the country, it was ex-
pected that l lson would carry some
or the New England states, and would
poll plnralities in a few of the larger
eastern states; on the other hand
iiiairy oi the western states were, her
tore the election, conceded to llu‘ghes.
but practically every state west of thc
Missl ippi has gone for it on.

it is generally thought that in order
to win the election either candidate
must carry three or the doubtful
states, which are California, \Ilnilesos
ta. New Hampshire, New hie. co, Ore-
gotr, and Wyoming. Wilson seems to
be very strong in California, and it is
not at all improbable birt that he
should finally carry the Golden Statc.

Another interesting situation that
the election broitgltt out was that the
Senate would remain with a Demo-
cratic majority, but that the House
would probably be divided equally be-
tween the Republicans and Democrats,
according to the pres. reports there
will be its members oi cacti oi tiicsc
trio parties in the lower unit of Cons
gress. That will mean that the three
Socialist members elected yesterday
would have the deciding votc The
Sociali is elected nore Berger aitd

the history oi the United States that
there have been three Socialists in

ball on his own 20 yard litre, stuith‘
oi Drake was forced to print and Watt
returned 20 yards to Drake's 40 yard
line, where on the next play Angus,-
tiire ran around right end through a
broken field for a touchdown.

The other two touchdowns were
scored in the second quarter. Grin—
nell opened the period with the ball
on its own 20 yard line and in tour
successive first downs carried the ball
to Drake's seven yard line, where the
blue was penalized Ihe, placing Grim
ncll on thc two yard line with iour
downs to score. Watt then went over
the line on a delayed pass. The same
performance was repeated later in the
quarter when Sat-ff had lurked high
iii the air 20 yards to Watt, who was
downed iii the center oi the iicld.
Three sticec. -ive itrst downs mostly

third quarter with two or three short
end rtins and line smashes which car»

placed the scarlet on tiic defensive.
Drake could not gain consistently
through Grinnell's line and resorted
to forward pas. s in a desperate at-
tempt to score, Hall the blue and white
eleven been able to gain on anything
but passes in this stage of the fray, it
is almost certain that it would have

gained on e. ,iy c: hange on prints.

The Grinnell fullback shone Ill-£114
iantly all through llle’gmue, and many
believe he played the best game of his
football career. With almost no illlel‘<
fcrcncc he got away ior several long
end runs, one oi which netted Grill-
ncll tlie iii.t touchdown. His work in
snia, ing the center oi the line was
wotiderfiil, and he seldom failed to
register a ga , long drop kicl:
