Jazz symphony orchestras will be
genuine American organizations in
the hour l‘uturo, according to the pre-
diction of Prof. H. W. llatlach oi the
school of music. Would it not give
the lore - oi the conventional type of
composition somewhat of a surprise
to hear- a saxophone snorting out on
air such as comes from Irving Berlin
or George Cohan whcn they attend a
concert by their favor c’ urchestrzl'.’
What would they think when they
iorrnd the music "going right to their
feat" .

chcral hundred years hack the man
who darod to var a chant with an oc-
casional slldcstl'ombone effect between
the sustained notes was to be shunned
as a messenger of evil. When an en—
tire cornmunity hogan to add several
more notes to the hymn tunes than the
coinposor had written, that vicinity
was declared to be in a state or de—
hauch by the outside world,

The l llcutcd “Despair-ell"

When this “popular" form hocamc
recognized as good music, the ”cdrr
cated" or the timc were in great d
pair. and weepingly said the only ouI
come of such a state or aiiairs was rho
uipin'g off of man irom the face of the
earth.

“As people started to dance, they
found that the steps were nruch eas' i
when accompanied by music which
had a steady rhythm," Mi . atlack can
plaincd. “From that time music hogan
to assume a lighter nature, and many
new eifocts were introduced. The pop-
ular music of late has added new
nirrsic and new sounds with its jazz
bands. The new effects mark a dis-
tinct and novel departure in musiiztl
expression, and are as typically Amen
loan as the skyscraper!”

Jazz effects have already found their-
way into the highest class oi Amerr
can music tbrn Fel'cy Grarnger and
Leo Ornstc'rhsﬁérlth'u—cvnmvseh‘atcmﬂe
ing to harmonic rules. the Grainger
compositions, .when properly pet'
for-med. make unusually attractive fO\'
trots. The ideas for the rhythm in
the Graingcr numbers have been taken
from popular ragtime. and those who
refuse to listen to popular music won—
der at the genius and originality of
the writer when the symphonic verve
sion is played, and could “just stay
and listen all night."

sued last week. Although there are
less men than last yeitr, this decrease
is almost. counterbalanced by the
greater number of girls admitted. The
total enrollment this year l5 811, as
against 829 in 1916. There are 447
women and 324 men.

The freshman class shows at Slight
increase over that of last year. It
numbers 232, while last year the new
students numbered 278. The number
listed as unclassiﬁed is greater than a.
year ago, 00 being so register-ed now
and 43 last year. As neilrly all of those
unclassiﬁed are new Students. the total
number of new members this year
shows a big increase.

Although the women outnumber the
men in every class, the difference is
not so great in the luwel‘hlasscs as
among the juniors and seniors. This
is no doubt due to the larger number
of men nf military age in the tWo
upper classes. In the freshman class
there are 131 men and 151 women,
while as men and 27 women are listed
as unclassiﬁed.

The house chair-pron of the men’s
