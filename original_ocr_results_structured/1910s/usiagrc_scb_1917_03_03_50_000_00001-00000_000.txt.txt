Ago—Dill Vot Wish To
Tull-I “Politics."

“Russia will win, not so much her
cause of the loyalty of the people to
the Czar, but because at their hatred
of the Germans," Count 11118. Tolstoy
told a Scarlet and Black reporter in
an unguarded moment alter his lccA
ture last night. He then refused to
speak of “politics" further, after hav-
ing qualified this statement by Saying
that the Russian people have always
regarded Germany as their most
dreaded enemy and would not end the
war until they were victorious.

"Russia cannot be dcfatcd," the
Count hail prefaced his statement. She
is growing her own food stuffs and
cannot be starved out, he said. The
blockade is affecting her not at all as
tar as food is concerned. He did ad
mit, however, that getting munitions
into Russia was a ditficult task and
made the rather startling statement
that must of the present Russian mu-
nitions are being manufactured in Ja-
pan and shipoéd to the eastern coast
of Asia, there to be transmitted by
rail.

Left llussiu Three Months Ago.

Count Tolstoy refused to make any

statement in regard to the Russian at}

titude toward Americ; lie said that
he wished to make no statement tor
himsclf and that he knew nothing or
the generaliattituiie of the Russian
people.

The Count leit Russia but three
months ago and is making a lecture
tour of the United States. While in
Russia he was for some time superin-
tendent of several hospitals.

one in the navy, and a third who is

“I do not wish to talk of politics," he
said.

Goes To Detroit.

The Count Came to Grinnell last cv—
ening lrom Iowa city, where he had
lectured and left late in the evening
for Chicago, on his way to Detroit,
where he will lecture tonight. While
in Gl-lnnell, he was the guest of Mrs.
Steiner. He has been a personal friend
of Dr. and Mrs. Steiner for some time.

Personally the Count is a very pleas-
ant, likeable man, with an inciitablc
cigarette in his fingers. His accent is
almost German, and is much less than
that of many men who have lived in
this country many years. In other re-
spccts he might be an ol'dlni‘try type of

courteous Russian who has come to the amount of $1,200, by means of n for admission.

Is Writing nooks.

While in America, the Count is have
ing printed thrce booiis oi his own
writing, one a novel and two othcrs
on his father‘s life and ideals. The
one book consists of a collection of his
lectures on his father. 0f the novel
he would say little. He was willing
to talk on only one subject, his lather.

Last night in his lecture Count Tols-
toy told in detail of the lite of his
world rained father, Count Loo Tols—
toy, who died in 1910. The keynote or
his whole addi ss was the extreme dc-
votion at his father to his work. He
studied in his room all day," said the
noted man’s son, “and we children
would not see him until about five o"
clock in the afternoon Sometimes he
would come out to lunch and we would
