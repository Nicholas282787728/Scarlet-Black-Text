ning' of the Year.

"Prooahly no other school has had
a football season just like our . We}
have heard many people remark out
ithis. The season was noted tor its
many scoreless games. We were
ldcleatcd slightly at the hands of Dn-
buque and Coe, on account or slippery,
slickcry halls. But. we piled up ’71
lpoints against the Drake team who
were thairhtul to get oil with zero.

From the (Joe game on the season
was a triumph. The team ilcd
through without a single detect, Iowzh
who has talren Mllmrlsota’s, Northwest-
ern’s, and Ames’ scalps, did not score
against us. The fast Fort Des iloincs
team found themselves up against a
stonewall on which they could make
no impression. Thcwor or the lines-
men was exceptionally brilliant in this
game. Not a single nose was hrohen
in the Penn battle. but we held our
own' in spite or this hoodoo.

The Cornell game? El', neithc side
scored. Sarcasticl Never. “Cést la
