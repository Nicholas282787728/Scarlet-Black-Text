on “The Human Side of
Trench Warfare”

LECTURE WILL BE HELD IN
CHAPEL ‘AT 8:00 TONIGHT

Beith Is Author of “The First
Hundred Thousand”—Is
a Highlander

Iau Hay (Major Beith), one oi Engr
land's ioremost lecturers and novel-
ists, wil speak in Heiiick chapel this
evening, as the iourth number on the
college lecture course. His subject
will be “The Human Side oi Trench
Wat-lore." The lecture will begin
promptly at 3 o'clock.

Major Bcilh, oi the Argyle and Suth-
erland Highlanders, is piobably the
‘only novelist who has recorded the
progress oi a campaign and the mak-
ing of an army, under such circum-
stances as "The First Hundred Thou-
sand" was written. It is admittedly
one oi the best war cpics cver enjoyed
by the public, and the most popular
war book of the day. In this iascinat—
ing book be iollows the growth or the
regimental spirit in the new army;
how it gradually absorbs the atmos-
phere oi the past and learns some oi
the history oi the corps whose name
it bears.

Served in Kitclleller’s Army
“Major Ecitb," wrote one oi Ameri-

Cd’s leading c cs, “is a Scots nove st

whose books are published under the

name or ’Ian Hay.’ At the beginning

or the war he enlisted in the Argyle

and Sutherland Highlanders, and was

thus one oi the ﬁrst hundred thousand
» oi Kitchener-s army

During 1916-17, . ajor Beith deliv-
ered 175 addresses thruout the United
States. iighty‘loul' oi these addresses
were given gratuitously to training
‘cauips, workingmen's clubs, etc. At-
ter paying personal expenses, hire oi
buildings, royalty on ﬁlms, and ad:
vertising, he was enabled to hand over-
to various war reliei societies. such as
the American Red Cross, British Red
Cross, and certain British regimental
iunds, the sum at $8,667. This sum
represents Major Beith's personal cone
tribu‘tion and does not include sums
raised by public meetings in aid or
various war charities at which be him»
pened to he the speaker, or one oi the

, speakers, oi the evening. Major Beith
receives no allowances or traveling
expenses oi any kind irom the British
government.

Discuss Three “'ur Phases
Major Eeith tonight will discuss the
rival in France, the British soldicr

in the trenches, the three phases oi
the war, the art oi holding on, munie
tions, what our women are doing to
help, our iriend the enemy over the
way, his change in demeanor, and va-
rious other phases oi the present war.

Major Beith is now ser 'ug on the
staff, but it was as a regimental ufﬁ»
cer that he gained his experience and
obtained the material ior his excel-
lent book, He won the military cross
for bravery in the ﬁeld. He was all
thru the great battle oi Loos and the
subsequent operations, and his deg
scription oi that ﬁght is one or the
best modern war pictui s ever painted.
