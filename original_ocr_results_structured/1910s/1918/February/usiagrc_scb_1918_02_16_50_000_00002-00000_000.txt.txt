WIN THE WAR!

CAPTAIN OSGOOD

In picking Osgood as captain of the
1918 team, the football sonad has se-
lected a man who has ranked high in
Iowa football circles ever since he en»
tered college. “Ozzy" has made a rear
ord for himself as a ﬁghter. and be
has been given state and conference
honors by the critics.

Last spring we were very unceu
tain about the rate oi ioothall during
the war. Now, no such uncertainty
exists. AS long as we havc incn here,
we will have a iootball team, in ac—
cordance with the request of Presi-
dent Wilson and leading educators all
over the country. Next year's team
may not be up to this year‘s standard
on a basis oi games won and lost, but
we believe that it will maintain the
same standard or "ﬁght” that charac—
terizes every Grinnell team.

The fact that Osgood has volunteer-
ed tor government service and been
rejected makes it particularly ﬁtting
that he should lead a team which will
be composed largely of men who are
under draft age or who for some other
reason have not been able to enter the
military service. Osgood and the 1918
team have or heartiest support.

THE MIDLAND

The Daily Iowan, after copying The
Scarlet and Black’s editorial on the
Iowa Press and Authors' Club‘s short
story contest, and commenting favors
ably on the same, takes onense at our
statement that “Grinnell is the only
Iowa college or university that sup-
ports a literary magazine."

"When our neighbors ignore the ex-
istence of The Midland, the univerr
slty‘s literary magazine, they are grat»
ing on one or our most sensitive
nerves,” says the Iowan. ”A product
which has been given an A-l rating by
so them a short story critic as Mr.
Edward J. O'Brien ot the Boston
Transcript is certainly worthy or some
recognition in our own state. We are
proud of our Midland."

We too, as Iowans and Westerners,
are proud or The Midland. It is a
magazine a: high standards and real
merit. It has not been considered.
however, as a University of Iowa pub-
lication. The present editor lives in
Minnesota. and of the twelve associ-
ate editors, only six come irom Iowa
City. To our knowledge. the univer-
sity has never been menioned in the
magazine as having any oiiicial con-
nection with the editorial stair.

It the University or Iowa is to have
credit tor The Midland as a university
publication, the magazine itscli should
state Its connection with the univer-
sity.

The Midland ls earning an enviable
place tor itself among American liter»
ary publications. It is setting stand.
ards for Western literature. All
honor to the editors that are making
such a magazine possible.

THE PRESS CONVENTION
(From Iowa State Studenl, Amos)
Tuesday's issue of the paper an-

nounced the meeting of the college
press association at Cedar Rapids for
the 8th and 9th of next month. This
is the annual convention or the asso~
ciation of college men and women who
are engaged or interested in journal-
lstic work.

Last year Iowa State had more Iepr
resentatives than any other school at
the convention, which was held at
Colfax. This year We have hopes of
doing the same illlhg. We have more
to contend with to get there because
of the speeding up work and other
activities. while Cedar Rapids is an
easier place to get to for some schools
than for us.

The Student ls not anxious to have
the most people there simply for the
Purpose of bragging about attendance.
although we like to do that. too. T
convention is something which is
worth while tor the person who at-
tends. Those who are in charge of
the arrangements feel that it should
be stlll more So in these times when

Criticism of such an organization
as “Cap and Gown" is very inappmr
piiate at this time. The author would
not talre the liberty to cast any reflecs
tion upon it in view or the existing
conditions, but a ten constructive sug—
gestions may be acceptible.

with this idea in mind, let us re-
view the "qualiﬁcations ior member-
ship" which the ”Quadrangle Social
Committee" submitted to the faculty.

The purpose, while seemingly very
deﬁnite. in analysis reduces to mud.
"The recognition of women” who have
never had more than ten hours oi C
and the rest A and B work, will not
obtain "higher standards of scholar-
ship and loyalty to the ideals of Grin-
nell."

In the reporter's story and the edlr
torial column is the only place that
any mention is made or “Cap and
Gown” setting the social standards in
Grinnell. Also we ﬁnd by the story
that only ten girls are eligible. Now,
if ten girls, selected on the scholar-
ship basis as prescribed, are to create
a social standard an'd social reform in
Grinnell. they will reverse all recent
history

Dn-ing the past four or ﬁve years,
the girls that would fill the scholastic
qualiﬁcations or "Cap and Gown" in
Article 111. have not lull-illed sections
3 and i oi B in Article II or their
charter. This will work vice versa as
well, Very seldom has exceptional
scholarship been accompanied by
”leadership" and “service to the col-
lege."

Were we to accept the cummuliica»
tion of ”A Girl“ in the last issue, we
would have to deduce that only .ten
girls at this time "are worthy in every
sense or the word to be called real
girls." - z.
