HERE FRIDAY EVEHINC,

Squad Is in Good Condition and
Hopes to Retrieve Last
Week’s Defeat

EXPECT SHIFT IN LINE-UP;

BAGGE IS NOW ELIGIBLEl

Other Changes Are Possiblee
Dickerson May Be Tried
at Forward

Crimrell v 1 meet the strong Anrcs
team in one of the most important
gaures on the local schedule Friday
night on the honre ﬂoor.

The teanr has settled down to a
week of hard work in order to retrieve
themselves after the disastrous detect
at Cedar Falls last week. As far as
injuries are concerned, the team is no
worse on than it was betore the con-
test. Somers still has thc char-ley
horse which has been bothering him
for some time, but with the exception
of a few minor bruises the rest 0! the
squad or in good condition. Garner-
has acquired a bad cold because of up»
due exposure on the return trip, but
hopes to be rid of this hindrance by
Friday night.

will Shift Line.llp .

It is quite probable that there will
be a shift in the line up when the team
appears on the ﬂoor Friday night.
Bagg'e has now completed the ranch -
rneuts to make him eligible for varsity
competition, and without doubt will
play against Ames. Eagge played a
fast, consistent game last year and
was placed on the lows Conierence
honor roll by basketball critics. Those
who have seen him play know that he
has a faculty of locating the ring from
a distance, and can also stand the
strain of a hard game He is being
worked at Wass‘enaar s guard and also
at one of the forward positions, and
may appear in either place.

Dickerson rs also being tried out at
forward, but it is doubtful if the Gar»
neruHammond combination will be
broken, having been the main scoring
cog of the Grinnell machine up or the
present time. Augustine will hold
down his regular position at the pivot
job, with Somers playing one guard
and Wasscnaar, hagge or Gass playing
the other.

No Basis for Comparison

It is a hard proposition to compare
the Grinnell aggregation with that of
Ames, because the two teams have not
played any one school. It is almost
impossible to compare two teams on
the basis of comparative scores, as was
proven in the columns ot this paper
last year. Ames has won from me
strong Cornell team which defeated
Iowa before the Christmas recess.

Since that tirue, however, Ames has
lost Morgan, captain ct this year's
team, and Boyd, one of Coach Walter’s
nrain stays. This makes Grinnell‘s
chances so much better. and Ames’
chances so much less. A victory for-
the scarlet and black would put the
locals high in the state again and pull
Ames down the percentage column.

l While the newspapc daily report
the discovery oi / desperate German
plots and plotters, a mysterious group
that holds secret meetings at regular
intervals has been discovered in the
livery heart of the Crinncl campus.

The per-sous accused of hcrng meme
bers of the gang arc, unbelievable as
it may seem, members of the college
iaculty. or course in the past many
students have thought them capable
of rrrost any crime, but this rs really
worse than could have been pictured
by the most active imagination. Out
oi respect to the age and past good
record oi those involved, their plende
irrgs have been heard and no names
will be mentioned

Tire meetings, doubtless to camoue
cage the real nbiect, have been held
in that seemingly rrrrroceut place, the
botany laboratory. but the incriminat-
ing part of the whole matter is the
purpose of these nocturnal sessions.
it is nothing less than to eat BEANS.
Cztll orrc imagine anything or a more
dark and sinister natural

The detailed facts as so far report-
ed are these: At two-week intervals
certain members of the college faculty
gather in the laboratory or the botany
department and partake or a meal con—
sisting mostly of beans. After the feed
the desparatloes enj . a social hour,
it is thought as a means of mental re»

Normal—Grimm“ Leads in
Field Baskets

Iowa State Teachers college tri-
umphed aver Crinnell, 20-18, in the
third game of the season for the local
team, at Cedar Falls Saturday evening.

The game was featured by many
tools being called on Gi'iunell, the
Teachers winning by making the most
oi their chances in this line. James,
the speedy Cedar Falls for-ward, threw
in out of 19 chances at the ring from
the foul line, while Hammond only
made 2 out of 7 and Augustine did not
make any out at s chances,

At no stage or the game was either-
team sure of victory. The lead went
from one side to the other, and not une
til the ﬁnal whistle blew was the game

decided.
lie at End of Hull

At half time the score stood at nine
all. but the foul-throwing of James
won the game for the Teachers. Grin-
nell made a total oi eight ﬁeld goals
as against the Teachers' ﬁve, but only
made twenty per cent of her chances
from the foul line, while Cedar Falls
made tor-ty-ﬁve per cent of her-
chances. It the game had not been
mar-red by so many louls it would have
been a real exhibition of basketball.
This is the ﬁrst time that the state in
stitution has ever triumphed over the
locals at the indoor game.

Iternrcd ‘Scicilulic Hel'erlil " llarry
gl’cal chemists have come into being
tbr-u intimate work with older chem»
rats of established reputation. The
German dye supremacy bciore the war
was largely due to genelutions of sci-
lenliﬁc men named in laboratories une
dcr tarnous chemists," he said

“America can become within 2.3
years the grtatcst chemical country in
the world," he continued; “but if such
is to bc truc, there must be more men
who will go rrrto pure research work,
rather than thc more remuneratrvc ine
dustrial work. We are looking to such
schools as Grinnell for men oi such
a type, because schools like Grinnell
are tar-tlrcr removed hour the commer-
cialism and materialism of the world
at large.”

The latter part of his talk took up
the direct relation of chemistry to the
war, in such things as the development
,of optical glasses for military ‘pure
poses. and nitrates tor explosives.

He showed the importance of the
Chemist's role in gas-warfare, by the
authoritative statcrrreut that one-third
of tho shells ﬁred on the western front
contain poisonous gases.

MAJCR BEITH GIVES
CREAT WAR LECTURE

Victory Will Be Won Only by
Slow Process of Wearing Out
the Central Powers

Major Ian Hay Berth, of the British
army, gave a very interesting and il—
luminating lecture on the war at Her
rick chapel last Saturday evening.

He illustrated his lecture with
French government pictures and also
photographs which he himself Look
while at the front.

Major Beith pointed out that since
the allies had gained supremacy ot the
air, the outcome of the war was no
longer uncertain.

“list “‘93! Out the Enemy

The war will be won, he thinks, only
by a process of wearing out the enemy.
The sooner and more vigorous the
Germans attack the western front, the
quicker will the entente have a deci-
Slve victory.

According to Major Beith, the ino-
rale of the allied soldiers in splendid.
Their greatest ieal‘ is that the people
at home will become weary and make
some sort of a premature pence.

Major Beith took dinner at the men's
dormitories on the evening of the lec-
ture. He entertained a group of stu»
dents for over an hour in one of the
clllberooms by answering questions
and telling about his experiences at
the front.
