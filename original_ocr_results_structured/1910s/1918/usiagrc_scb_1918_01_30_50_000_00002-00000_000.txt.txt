OUR NEW HEAD

Our new front page heading will,
we hope, help to signify the close l'elus
tionship hetween Grinnell the college,
and the student newspaper of Grinnell.

The words "Scarlet and Black" have
no special signiﬁcance in themselves.
But add the word "Ci-innell" and we
have a new and deeper meaning. We
who believe in Grinucll, helicve that

the \‘cry word Grinnell caiiies )Ilspil’u:
lion and Ideal in. We have tried tow

portray and Interpret that idealism in
The Scarlet and Black. We shull try
even harder to do that In The Grillncll
Scarlet and Iilztdk.

Exluu Questions
Out of fairness to the student, it is
quite obvious that an instructor should

' iint dictate a double, oi even a single,
_ set of examinahcn questions, and cite

pect the student to do justice to the
course. Questions, hung at the sure
dent in such mad haste as the nature

of the case mak’es necessary, bring in.
a hurried, jumbled mass of answers'

and problems that he has been at-

. tempting to isolate and keen straight.

There is a question as to whether iL
is a huslllessdlke and systematic way
or conducting an examination. Prints
ed or typewritten questions are much
more satisfactory. With such a set of
questions the student may start in
with the ﬁrst question and think out
and answer one question at a time un-
til he is thru, and while answering the
ﬁrst question does not have to he
hothered with his last question, or the
question that his neighbor may have
or not hm e, as much depends upon the
speed with which he writes. It would,
of course, cost Something In serve KID
an examination in the proposed style.

[Al/ELI SPEAKS AT VESPERS

Emphasizeslmportance of Doing
the Daily Task

Protessor C. F. Lovell. in his ad-
di ss at Vespers last Sunday, emnh
. zed the importance of the daily task

“It is asmnishlng how many my
teries asc tn haftle us, how many
puzzles anish, if we simply turn away
and do the thing that lies directly he-
iorc us," he said. ”No matter it the
heavens fall, we must go on seekmg‘
knowledge and guiding others to It."

“The business or education is to turn
the eye of the soul to the light, to see
, That light is bathed
In the light of God, the source or light.
Keep the law, do the day's work, and
God will do the rest," he concluded.

Will Send Medals to

The University at Minnesota has an-
pointed a committee to make plans to
sending a service medal to all Miniler
. ta inen who are in the service, and
will he ﬁnancially supported by the
Suldcllls of (hill. institution.

hlr. E B Johnson, who had charge
of iding these medals iiom Minne—
solu In 1392;, says: “Few people have
any concept Ii or how much these
medals means to those who receive
them. It w. hut a short time ago,
continued M
Ito whom we had neglected to send a
medal at the time of the Silaliisll»Am-
crican war, came intu iIIy olfice and
asked it i could give him a medal."

The committee plans
medals inside at proper and will he
