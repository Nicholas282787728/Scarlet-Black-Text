EMPHASIZE SUGIAL
llFE AT ‘Y’ MEETING

Discuss Importance of Training in
Social Functions During
College Course

President ntoser or the Y. M. C. A
threw the weekly meeting last Thurs-
day night in tlie cirrh room at Building
oire open to a d cusston at “Our Snr
oral Lite." Both sides or the present
question were merely aired hi- all
meuihers present,

in opening the discussion iloser
stated the situation i-ery hroadly as
eouti ing of three points, ﬁrst, that
we are either iir favor of the present
trend of social tunetioiis, or we arc in
i'avor or a new system, and third, w-c
hart! It now plan to propose.

The relations of college iricii with
their tellows in everyday lite, their re—
lations with the life or tire college and,
then own value it tli , do not lluew
how to "meet” and to ' came into
ttie focus or much c at discussion.
That the college man does not have a
comp tc “llllclal alts” education it he
does not iceeivc a college training in
the social trinctions into which lie is
th'On‘ll upon graduation, was [L ponrt
strongl' emphas .ed or one oi the
speahc .

Erei one present agreed that a ti -
tiier change was necessary. ileCo —
hack IS struck the keynote of the ct ,
niiig when he said that w c did not \ sh
to swing the pendulum of our social
tire to the extreme of dancing as Kirov
seemed to have from the article ice
eeived from there. The idea of being
distinctive but not dwarted in our-,so-
eial life was heartily received hy all.

A I'e- -al'li\ngen]el\l‘ vi the present
system and a system modeled on the
lite outside of the college walls was
the sentiment expressed by the' meet-
ing as a whole.

ot the fact tlrat the traclt is a little too

Prospects for a fl‘esnlllali victory

ahsence of Dave Evans, who ' at his

severe blow.
