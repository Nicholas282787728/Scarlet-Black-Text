EUTYCHUS FALLS
THREE STORIES
AND S_TILL LIVES

Eutychus [oil from a three-story win-
dow (so goes the Bible story). But
in this case Eutychus was a vciy small
cut, that was waiting impatiently in
the basement of Blair Hall. His tram
tic appeals for company were ﬁnally

heard and he was taken to the thil'd5

floor to play on thedcsks. Tho nioths
and flies flew in the window and
Eutychus had a wonderful time pur-
suing them. Perhaps Eutbychus dazed
just a minute and dreamed he saw a
wonderful hig moth. At any rate he
gave a sudden jump and instead or
coming down on the desk, he kept
going dew-n and down. Eutychus'
keeper hurried down stairs rather exA
asperated at the thought that opera-
tions on “subterranean valves" and
hcrauhrastic passages would have to
be performed that night instcad oi
the next morning. She grouod around
in the darkness and called "Eutychus".
A faint “meow" name and she found
him—very flat. She carried him gently
up stairs and laid him on the desk.
Two minutes later Eutychus was
catching moths again. However, there
is a ﬁrm hello: in the "Bug lab" that

. there is something in a name.
