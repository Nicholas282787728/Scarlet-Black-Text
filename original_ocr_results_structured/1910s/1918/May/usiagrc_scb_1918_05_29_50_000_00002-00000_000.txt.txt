“WORK OB FIGHT"

The Grinhell man must not be an
idler this summer.

As the college year is drawing to a
close every man is planning some defi—
nite form of employment.

Some will continue their studies at
summer School, a iew will periorm
clerical work, others will go noon the
farm, while still another class will
enter military service some of these

r017 OLGHT To KNOW mush
(The Dililiv Iowan)

Since The Daily- Iowau's recent
suggestion that students should (liSr
criniinzlte between the candies which
require a large proportion of sugar
and the candies which require a mine
mum pronotrioh of sugar, We have
been asked several times to specin
some of the sugar savers, Here they
are; as given out by Herbert Hoov-
er, tood administrator:

There are at least iour groups oi
candy made from absolutely whole-
some ingredients which are plentiful.
The ﬁrst includes chocolate and cocoa.
candies with centers of nuts, fruits,
truit pastes, inarmalades, jams, and,
the like, especially the old fashioned
chocolate creams with the bitter coat-
ing, and the uncooted soft candy such
as nongatine, Turkish pastes, and
similar Varieties.

The second group includes “hard
boiled candies,” such‘ils lemon drops,
stick candy, fruit hrittle,‘ glace nuts
antl the like, containing a large por—
ticn of syrup and molasses candies.

Marshmallows and similar candy
comprise the third group being rﬂdic
with corn syrup corn starch and gelar
tin, and only a small percentage of
sugar. Tlley‘ may he eaten plain,
toasted dipped in chocolate, or rolled
in cecoanuts.

In the lourth group are included

gum drops, jellies, jelly beans and the
like

Learn this group or sngar»conserv-
ing candies, students. It you go on
gulping down the sugar without that
or conservation, you are not playing
square hy the men who leit our camp—
us to ﬁght our ﬁght. You can eiiect
that conservation by one or two ways:
(1) by giving up all of our sweet del-
icacies and desserts, or (2) by exercis-
ing voul' heads in selecting patriotic
substitutes. The two have the same
erect in the end, but the second is by
tor the easier to do.
