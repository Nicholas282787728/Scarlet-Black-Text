g In a letter just received from Miss
Elizabeth Drott, who is working in
company with Prol. Clara .uillerd in
an army canteen on the French front.
the former Grillllcll instructor relates
a number of .-ceptioiially interesting
clcuis. Her letter indicates that she
was writing within the sound of the
cannon. it was received by Miss Mary
Coleman, of the school of music face
utly. it follows in part:

We have an athletic director now.
and so the sights and sounds of spring
athletics are everywhere. Footballs
and hasketballs and baseballs are in
use all day long and long—llmbed sol-
tliers in white track suits streak thru
the atlnosphel'r after imaginary kniv
sers. Tho we hear the dull boom of
the cannonading “front" incessantly.
the men keep up a typical stream of
conversation ivith the umpire and are
as intensely interested in the fortunes
oi their company teams as in the nae
tional scores back home . Truly, were
it not for the uniforms you might ini-
agine our front yard was Ward ﬁeld
at the home meet.

Sues secretary linker .

Just a few days ago we had thel
thrilling experience of seeing our men
pass in review before Secretary of
War Baker. We stood about a dozen
teet from General Pershing, General
Ligett, General Jodre, General Dun—
can, and the secretary. Civilian
clothes are a rare sight here, and ’so
we weie amused at the contrast of the
generals of our forces, splendidly
strong and straight and every inch a
soldier, beside that of the small desk
warrior, in a. derby hat. who stood on
one foot.

Ker. Cross Lcnves

You all know of the great offensive
and how our men were sent up to the
British front. our particular i-egi.
nient, being the oldest in France, was
called on. They left suddenly and took
in. Cross and the other Y. ii, men
with them. We 'erc to be sent for,
but now all the women have been sent
out of the danger zone, much to our
grief, for we greatly loved our men.

“’2 spent an afternoon in the Lu.
embourg Gardens, lively with gr en
things anti little children As we
watched the youngsters rolling hoops.
swinging, waiting for the Punch and
Judy show to begin, and romping with
their mothers in streaming black. we
tried to imagine the havoc and inur-
der if the new gun should strike them.
Just then it did strike, two blocks
away, so that our bench rocked with
the shock, The shell hit a hospital,
killing about twenty women. Surely
it is a vicious method of warfare and I,
tor one, am ready for the most effect—
ive kind of repi' ads that the German
people may roal’ e just what their
Warl‘lOl'S are doing.

We have a great opportunity to use
me books, etc., which you all have
sent, both at the cafe reading room
and oiit at camp. Thank you for cw
ei-ything.

If you are the girl whosc willilig hands
