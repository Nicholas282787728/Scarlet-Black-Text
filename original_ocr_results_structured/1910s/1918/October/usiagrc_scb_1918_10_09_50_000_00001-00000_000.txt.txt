"Uncle Joe's Lincoln” Is Story of

Dr. Steiner has written a now book.
it is in keeping with the times in that
it is a patriotic. American story.
“Uncle Joe’s Llncoln." is the title or
the book which is the story or a pa-
triotic Hungarian 01' Civil War times.

Uncle Joe. the Hungarian. had
taught in the Civil \l' and alter-
war-ds rtturucd to Hungary miriris a

miratioii tor Abraham Lincoln and in-
.tillcd this admiration i to the boy or

'ol Amm an democracy and told him
‘oi America.

Later the boy and the Uncle Joc
wcavc their dcas of Abraham Lincoln
into the lite and customs or Hungary,
and bcldre the old man dies America
is almost the old man's rcllo'on.

Tho book gives a very good idca ot
the lmv‘s attitude toward America and
it gi es the rcadcr a ircw point or
rich:

Dr, Stcincr says in his foreword:
“What garo mo the greatest joy in
writing it was that it allor-ded mc thc
opportunity or lle'l. rig witness to the
patriotism or our toreign-born Clll' us.
who iii this period or national stress.
have not lulled in loyalty and devotion
to their adopted country.

“It is a matter- or pridc to sec thcii-
names on the honor roll ot the nation.
paying in part, at least. the debt we.
the allellrlml'll. owe to our United
States."

"Such a book as this is extremely
valuable today when we have a dc—
scidcd nccd ct Iol'cigll»lmrn Americans
like Dr. Stcincr to interpret their
countrymen 1.0 us."
