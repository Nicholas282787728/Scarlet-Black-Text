DRILL PHDVES A

Sergt. Vance Organizes
Work During Short
Sojourn Here as
Commandant

Since the first drill, soon alter war
was declared. military training in Gl'in
iiell has assumed liioie scrious piopop
tions as timc has progressed, and now
with three uniformed companies of 70
men each (llilling twice a week, thc
work has come to something wcll
worlh while to the cadets.

The drill noll' looks far dilfcrcnt
than it did when the group of mcn
which lined up for the ﬁrst time last
year under the supcri-isioii of Captain
Mnmma, former commandant at Iowa
City.

shortly following thcsc ﬁl'sL [cw
drills Lieutenant Geiger was secured
as commandant and work began in
earnest, and altho the drill was at that
time voluntary a good representation
was present every evening. l-iikes
were taken and later a competitive
drill was held in which a review or the
work done was given. company A was
victor - and is at the present time
possess of the dag.

Ducim‘ 'nns 'l'ilktls Cll‘ll'ue

At tile ﬁrst of the present year great
difficulty was expeiicnccd in obtains
ing a commandant. Dr. E. 5. Evans
volunteered to take charge of the drill
and carried it on until Licut. w. M. P,
Mitchell was secured, who at that time
took the drill into liis hands: Guns
were ordered, the companies were ar-
ranged in permanent formation and
Serious work began. A few weeks lat—
er Lieutenant Mitchell was called to
report/for active service and left, plad
ing the drill again in Doctor Evalls'
hands.

The/ guns which had been ordcrcd,
altho they were only dummies with no
bore, were sei ed by the government
and used for d .11 purposes. The drill
was conducted in the cold armory and
the men hecaiiie somewhat discourag-
ed. Eﬂol'ts were made to secure a
commandant who could devote all his
time to the drill and when Dr. J. P.
Spramic left for crime in Washington
he secured Sergeant Hart Vance. of
the 11th Base hospital unit of Chicago.

Ulill'orllls [\I'u Ol'ilerctl

With the an ‘al of Sergeant Vance
the drill was shifted to the gymnasium,
uniforms were ordered. tiyouls for of-
ﬁcers were held, and the commissioned
Officei's appointe fficels’ school was
begun, and the drill was again el‘llhuv
siastically received. Tryouts for the
non-commissioned officers were held,
the guns which were similar to the
1303 Springﬁeld model arrived, and the
drill was again conducted out of doors.

On March 2 Sergeant Vance was
called into active service, and at this
time the appointments of the non—com-
missioned officers were announced.

Drill 'Collllllctcll by Cutlets

since that time the drill has been in
the hands of the commissioned offi-
cers, who Co. A, Maurice Frid-
lund, captain; Royal Duckwcrth, ﬁrst
lieutenant; Vincent Dauhenberger. sec-
ond lieutenant: Tyler Barney, ﬁrst 561
gednt. C B, Dennis Kelly, captain;
Ben Ellsworth, first lieutenant; lack
Heath, second lieutenant; Robert Hil-
ler, ﬁrst sergeant, Co. 0, Earl Kllgoi'e,
captain; Fredei k Kaltcnbach, ﬁrst
lieutenant; Herbert Baker: second lieur
tenant; Frank Wilcoxcn, ﬁrst. sergeant.

President Alain in speaking of the
work which has been done since the
ar val of Scrgcant Vance said: “I
think that sergeant Vance did re-
markahly well during the short time
he was here and the student officers
have carried on the work very satis—
factorily since he left."

Sergeant Vance, who is now station-,
ed with the 11th unit of the base hos
pital at Camp Dodge, hopes to be able
to collie to Grinnell eveiy week end
to conduct officers' school and battale
ion drill.
