INSISTS THAT NEEDLESS

Gives Figures to Show Cost of the
War and Discusses Methods

of Financing It

That "busines as usual” cannot
continue if this war is to bc'won for
the Allies, was Professor G. P. Wy
koff‘s mcssagc in the sccoiid food can»
scrration lcctuic delivcred at chapel
Friday morning “The people don'l
real c that needless cxpensc at this
timc is criminal," he said.

Tim people should be impre, ed with
the nccd for conserving cvcrytliing
that constitutes the general supply, ac-
cording to secretary McAdoo. “Yet
the average citizen." said Professor
W ckoif. “has not given up any pleas-
“! S."

Busincss as Usual at. First

Business as usual during the ﬁrst
months of the war was iﬁablc and
dc Iable. but now that we have been
in it for a year it is high time that we
should all cut down to very lowest,
was the idea which be expressed

We would condcmn a gunniaker who
quit his job on government work at
present to work at increased pay for
a private individual, yet every time
that we buy a nuilrnecessity we are
bidding for labor against the govern-
ment, Professor Wyckoft tated.

The Cost or ‘Jrll

The cost of the war, as far as it can
be estimated by figures, in loss of life,
was given as seven million men killed.
According to Mr. Hearst. an English
cconomist, the cost in dollais has been
one himdied and forty-ﬁve billion dob
lni-s to datc. Of this amount Great
Britain has spent thirty billion, Gor-
mnny thirty billion, Francc twenty-ﬁve
billion and the United States twelve
billion.

E v day the United States is
spending more than twenty-nine mil-
lion dollars or what amounts to twen-
[yveight cents a day lor evci-y individ-
ual. Compared to this, Great Britain
is spending Lhirlyrﬁve million a day,
rcprcscnting a per capita rate of Save
cutymight ccnis; France has a per
capital rate of ﬁfty cents, and Gore
many of forty cert

run I'. ,. ml smilnl

Can the United States stand the
stiain ol the twenty billion dollar a
year which it is estimated the war will
cost us, asked Professor Wyckoff. We
should not allow ourselves to tbiiik
that we can do cvcrything, he warned.

“The United States is the best able
to cairy the expense, he said. "Altho
wc lime no colonies to depend upon
as England has, yet we have thirty per
cent of the World‘s wealth,

The problem of ﬁnancing our war
expenditures was taken up. Econo—
mists ol the country. he said, were
solidly behind a program of more in-
tensive tavation. A revised income

Final Score Is 28 to 19;
Grinnell Leads Thru-
out the Game

The “old right” and a varied attack
which Cornell was unable to stop.
were the dcciding factors in Gi-innell's
23719 victory over the vei-noiiites on
the local floor last night, The scarlet
team started with a rush and iii the
ﬁx t few minutes of play obtained a.

point lead. Baffled by the form
which the Gi-iiinell team displayed. the
visitors were never able to present
either a stubborn deieiise or an ag-
gressive offensive,

To the capacity crowd which saw

- the game, the last one on the home

ﬂoor. the contest seemed almost to
make a succcssinl season out of one
which had given promise of ending in
a disheartening manner.

lit-nil is NM: Threatened

The Grillllell quintet was never
beaded, nor was the lead accumulated
cai-ly in the game even seriously
’lluealened. The game had barely be—
gun when it became evident that the
locals had ﬁnally hit their stride, as
the passing and accurate basket-shoot-
ing was a great improvement over that
shown in former contests.

The game started with the dope fa-
vo ‘ g the Cornell veterans, who had
won from the scailet and black at ML
Vernon two weeks ago and had forced
Iowa to bow under a lopsided score
early in the season. It was a real
comeback which the Crinnell ﬁve 5mg-
ed in the face of these facts, but, altho
handicapped by size, the smaller men
iouglit like demons and won because
they played the best basketball.

liainnmnd Starts Scoring

Early in the game Hammond started
his consistent work at free throwing,
by tossing in two baskets from the foul
line. Before thc visitors were able to
register their ﬁrst point. somers drop-
pcd in a difficult basket from the side
or the court, and "Mike” Aiignstine fol»
lowed with a short one This Si)-
point leatl‘ was never lessened, but
gradually increased Illllil the end ot
the game. The first half closed with
Crinncll on the long end of a 16-9
count,

The opening of the second period
failed to bring iorth the rally which
was expected of the visitors, and on
the other hand the scarlet ﬁve contine
ued their consistent work of thc ﬁrst
period This halt was less spectacular
than the ﬁrst, being marred by a great

Toni Kepler was, outclassed so com-
pletely by “Mike” Augustine that it
is needless L0 compare their work.
"’Mike” played what was probably the
best game of his career. He shot more
baskets and played the ﬂoor better
than did his opponent. During the
second half Kepler was removed in
favor of Ci-igsby, whose position at
forward was taken by Hedges.

Somel's at right goal was not far
behind his leader in brilliant playing
and repeatedly broke up the short~
passing game of the visitors. Ham—

the locals, with a total of 16. The
