Game Characterized by Fumbles
Which Prove Costly to
Grihnell,

In a bitterly fought and evenly-
matched game that was in doubt until
the final whistlc, the Crinncll football
team lost to One last Saturday by a
score of 1a to s.

Crinncll took the lead in the ﬁrst
ﬁvc minutes of play, whcn Crane
broke thru tackle and ran 60 yards fort
the first touchdown. Osgood misscdi

ﬁrst score came late in the ﬁrst quar~
te -attcr line smashes by Hill and
Felipi had carried the ball to Grim
nell's tworyard linc. Here the scarlet
tcam made a last ditch stand for three
downs but in the fourth Barvinek cal»
ried the ball thru guard for the
touchdown. Hoselt kicked goal.

Grinncll Makes Safety.

Crinucll recovered the lead in the
second quarte. A forward pass to
Macy and a. series of short plunges
carried the ball to within two yardsi
of Coc's goal, where it was lost to Goa
on downs. out Lcmley blocked Coc's
attempt to kick from behind the goali
line, giving Grinnell two points on the
resulting safety, In the fourth nuai»
ter a fumble gave Coe the ball on
Griunell's 20- ard line and a well—
placed drop lck gave to Goa a lead of
two points. G innelrs desperate pass-
es werc successfully broken up for
the rest of the period and the narrow
margin of two points was sufficient for
Coe to win.

Break Up Plays.

In the ﬁrst few minutes of play the
Scarlet and Black eleven appeared to
have the advantage, but after Cranes
brilliant Goyard min, the game was a
ﬁght all the' way. The Goo team
seemed to have no trouble in solving
the mysteries of the Minnesota shift

MISS SARAII-MiiCDDNALD
PLEASES WITH REUITAL

If the opening entertainment of the
Recital Course is any criterion of
what the rest of them will be, the
music lovers of Crinnell will look for—
ward eagerly to each one. Those who
were in attendance declare that the
program was a musical feast.

The program was one of unusual
meritione that made demands upon
the technique, as well as the musician»
ship of the performer. Miss Mac-
Donald proved herself cqual to the
task. Her technique was flawless, and
her interpretation displayed a breadth
of conception and a deep understand—
ing of the intrinsic elements of music
at its heat.

The Chopin group consisted of numr
hers not usually heard, and was play-
ed with a delicacy and poetic feeling
that was a delight. The manner in
which Miss MacDonald played the
Brahms Sonata with its stupendous
requirements of technique and musi-
cianship. left nothing to he desired.
Particularly effective was the beauti-
ful Andante movement In the last
group of modern pieces, there was a
great variety of pianistlc and musical
ﬁreworks, brilliantly and tastefully
performed, and to an insistent encore.
Mlss MacDonald gave a very beautiful
interpretation of “Renata dans l'cau"

of the allied victory over Germany.

students, towns-people on .foot and in
cars, and. various organizations, ”In
cluding thc postsilfiicc force, and sev-
delegations from factories in
town. There were a number of
"floats" bearing a variety of slogans.

The parade marched down town
and around the park, then out through
the residential district. After parad-
ing through the business district and
covering approximately thirty-four
miles, according to some who were in
the line, the procession led back. to
the barracks where the afternoon was
spent by the men in athletic contests.
The Lug-o’-war which was Won by
“B" company, was the hardest contest-
cd event.

In the evening there was a big bone
fire with ﬁreworks on Ward Field.
Here also the S. A. T. C. was one of
the centers of attraction and the Milk
[My Police kept order. The program
was concluded with a Short review of
the men as they marched by platoons

Griimcll.
Nov, 23—CDYDOTT at Grinnell.

A game with the Medical Division
football team from Fort Des Moincs
has been scheduled to take place on

the Cornell game here on the 23rd
completes the schedule. Efforts were
made to book games with Minnesota
and \‘alious Glczt Lakes teams for
Thanksgiving Day but Conch Tallefson
announced last night that the season
would end November 23 with the Cor-
ncll game.

The Fort Medics team is a collection
of former college and prep. stars and
can be counted on to put up a good
ﬁght. I! he has not been sent to an
officers school before then, Sergeant
Ellis will conduct a pep meeting the
night before the game.

Coach Tollefson put the squad thru
El. light signal drill last night in prep-
aration for Saturday’s game. John-
son, injured in the Coe game. will be
out of uniform permanently, but Fra-
SCI was able to run signals last night
IGeLLys who was out of the Coe game
with a. sore arm, and Danbcnbergcr,
who was suffering with a cold, are bet-
ter and will be in trim Saturday. Getr
tys’ ability to receive forward passes
was sadly missed last Saturday when
a completed forward pass in the fourth
Quarter would have Won the game, If

the team faces the serious loss of Mil-
ler, Fraser and Crane, who were
among the number appointed to try
for commissions. Coach Tollcfson
worked Swanson at guard and Colter
at full last night, as Miller and Crane
were putting in extra military drill
and could not report for prnclice.

PELLA UNITED UNDER
DUMMAND 0F ADAMS

The commandant of (he Grinncll
S. A. T. C. has more than this post to
take care of. The unit at Central
College at Fella. is also under his coma
mand. There are about ﬁfty men in
the unit there and Lieutenant C. M.
Olson is in charge. Drill and other-
work is being taken up there in much
the same manner as in Grinnell. Cap-
tain Adams, commandant of the Grin-
nell Corps, makes frequent trips to
Pclla to see that things are progressr
ihg.

In the Fella school the girls of the
college outnumber the men about two
to one. Lieut. Olson has undertaken
to form two companies of girls to drill,
the some Way as the men. They go
through the same hours, and eat in
the same mess hall. The girls' coni-
panics arc the cause for much compe-
tition between the men and women.

Lieutenant Olson, who is a. brother
of Iwin Olson of Gl‘innell '22, has not
said which made the better soldiers,
either from the standpoint of disci-
pline or of proﬁciency in drill.

After marching into chapel in forma—

while Prof. Chas. Noble struck the key-
note of victory and peace.

Groutost Dily Ill Iliitbl'y.

“This is one of the greatest da -s of
history," he said, “that this struggle
has come to an and and victory has
been achieved. The victorious end of
this struggle means more to the future
of the human race than any previous
event of its kind. We are to celebrate
this wonderful day all our lives." ,

Liuu Smith, ’20, launched the cam-
paign by rousing the martial spirit

Work of United Cllnrllics.

”We all know what the United Chara
ity Workers did in the War that was,
and now we can say that the war that
was, But ‘Johnny doesn't come
marching hoine’ immediately.

Lois Meredith. '19, spoke from the
girls‘ viewpoint when she said, “Those
of uS Whose brothers and cousins Went
to the war at the very ﬁrst, know what
the ”Y” has brought to them. our
pledge of $7,150 is larger than it was
last year because there is more need.

“This pledge is a thank-offering.
Can we raise it? Can We fail to raise
it When it means gratitude to those
boys, some of whom have died? Can
Grinnell glve Thanks?”
