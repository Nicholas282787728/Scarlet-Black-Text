Professor Declares in Chapel Talk
That We Must Take War
in Dead Earnest

GIVES FINAL LECTURE OF
FOOD SAVING SERIES

“This Is No Tune to Work Out a
Diet ‘for the Belgians and
_ Frenoha” He Says

"We haven't yet taken the war in
dead earnest. We are so sure because
we are on the right side, that all will
go right in the end, that we do not
realize as yct what we are up against."
This was the statement made by Pro-
iessor H. w. Norris in his lecture on
"Meet, rat and Sugar,” at chapel yes-
terday inornin .

'ght doe not make right, but
right to prevail must have ‘the backing
oi might," be continued. “Virtue may
well be its own reward. but prepared»
ncss gives to virtue a reasonable pres-
pect oi a future."

l-‘ooll Gives Might

The speaker then pointed out that it
is iood which gives might to the strong
arm. "All kinds or road may be burn
ed in the body to produce energy, but
‘only one kind constructs, renews and
repairs the body, namely the proteins,"
he said. Furthermore, he pointed out
that it is not economical in terms or
money or lire to consume an excess or
proteid. The amount one ordinarily
consumes is tar in excess oi the need.
America should send this excess to ttie
Allies, he declared. ,

In answer to the argument that
America, should ship corn to Europe,
l=roiessor Norris said, ”This is not the
time to work out experimentally a
vegetarian diet tor the Belgians and
French, nor the ﬁtting opportunity to
send experts to prove to the hungry
multitudes oi Europe that American
corn is a universal iood. The chiei
thing to do is to win the war."

UNIVERSIIYTEAGHERS

‘ Causes Changes in Names of
V Speaking Departments

The Universities oi Wisconsin, llii.
nois and Iowa have a opted the “Grill-
nellJﬂau” or organi ng and naming
the department oi speech. An address
given by pror. J. p. Ryan beiore the
National Asociatioll oi Teachers or
Public Speaking at their qunventiun in
Chicago recently caused the associ
tion to recommend this plan to the d
icront colleges and universities or the
count as the best and most desirable
terini ology tor the courses in speech.

Cllnllgc Association Name

in the disco ion lollowiug the read-
ing or the article the association de-
cided to change their name to the "Na
tional Association or Teachers oi
Speech." and the name of their Jour-
nal to the “Quarterly Journal or
Speech Education." One oi the pic
hers stated that on lei-s were begin-
lling to realize that in his'special iield
Pi‘ol'e i- Ryan is the toreinost auth-
orit .

The article as it appeared in the
journal proposed the name or “depart-
ment ol speech" the most desirable
name tor all work which has been his
cluded in thc courses or public speak
ing, orato'ry, English speech and sini:
ilar courses. He pointed out that the
present time, when curriculum adj
inents are being made, is the best time
to change to a suitable name. The
great variety oi names now used are
uusatisiactory in that they usually do-
notc contusing ideas.

I . iiii Wri Magazine Articles

Protcs. r Ryan concluded, "The
word speech is short, old, simple, Star
ble, \vcllrkllown, accurate, common,
learned. cxtciisivc, itnd academically
acceptable.

Professor Ryan also has written an

cle which nppcn. in the cuircnt

.ue or the .iournal or Public Speak-

the best constructive speech, and
Thomas the best rebuttal.

The question was, “Resolved, That
the Federal Government's present pol-
icy oi ﬁxing prices oi necessities
should be made permanent." This
statement diiiei-ed somewhat in phras-
ing hour the question used in the oth
er \al‘slty contests.

Color do attempted to show that in
the per d oi ieconstriiction aiter the
war, price ﬁxing would be as ncccs
sa , as a: the present time. Further»
more, that such a policy has proved
practical in wartime, and that all the
great nations have adopted it.

As opposed to this, Gl'ilinell argued
that price oxinghas iailed in actual
practice, that it is economically unr
sound and that it is not necessary as
a permanent measure. ,

Board of Trustees Decide on In-

ing to action taken by the board or
t istecs and announced by the admin-

ration today. The tuition rate will
be raised to $125, making the total col-

the semester ice.

Tlils is a change or 350 in the rate
at the men's dormitories, an advance
oi $25 in the rate at the Quadrangle. ,
and an advance at $25 in tuition.

I)0I'Il| niid Quad Rate quml

Owing to the iact that the completed
men's dormitories include practically
the same advantages as those given the
women at the Quadrangle, and with
equally high “overhead" expenses, the
board decided to make, the same rate
tor the men and women.

“The prices approved and adnpted'
tor the coming year arc not in any
strict sense an advance in our rates,"
a member oi the board of trustees ex-
plained, “They represent only an ad»
instment, made necessary by price
conditions that artect everything re-
quired tor daily and general use. The
change in ﬁgures is an attempt to
maintain an equilibrium between cost
price. represented by what we must
hiiy, and selling price, represented by
the charge made ior living accommo»
cations in the Quadrangle and ior tui-
ion.

Alli-mice \ Not Meet Costs

"The readjustment will not maim’
tain,‘as conditions now are at just
enuilibriuin between cost price and
selling price, but the board oi truss
toes willingly make the test. It is
hoped that prices inr livingi expenses
have reached the limit oi advance, and
that the board will not be obliged to
consider the question or iiirther ad-
justment ior some time to come.”
