Training Corps Takes
Hike to the Country

Sergeant Gannaway took the Grim
hell College Training Corps composed
or the Civilians in Building Six on a
hike into the country Wednesday at»
ternoon, to put them into good condi-
iion for combating the “Flu".

The Company marched through town
and on out in to the country about two
miles beyond Arbor Lake. They then
turned back east, coming back on
East street. Just as they entered the
town they raided an apple wagon, adds
ing a little enjoyment to their Initl‘chv
ing. The men like hiking ever better-
than drilling, and are ready to go again
when they get the chance.
