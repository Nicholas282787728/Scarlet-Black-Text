‘ APPRECIATION"

Someone has said tiiar it is.tar bet-
ter to give tlowcrs to arr-rend while he
is living than to lay them on his cas-
lid after he is dead.

it is not that we expcct torllezu‘ oi
Protessor 1:, ri's immcdiatc death that
we are writing, brrt rather merely to

express in a small measure our air
preciation oi the earliest and sincere
work he has done since becoming jun-
ior dean or men, particular , in regard
to his management oi the dormitories.

Protcssor Ryan's success as chair-
nian ot the dormitory committee has
been immediate and complete. liis
manner or handling and settling such
problems as have arisen has met witli
absolute approval on the part or ev-
ery ina , in tact, even more thali air
Dl'0\'al,—lleai'l. approbation. Ere
Gr nicll mini is behind him. He com-
bines the viewpoint oi the iaciilty
member with that oi the strident, and
arrives at the happy medium. His de
cisions are considered ﬁlial. I-le coon
mantis the respect of all.

LET’S PEP UP!

A national movement has recently
been initiated which has tor its pu
pose the obtaining at work by eve
man tor the summer, or, in other
words, the annihilation oi the slacker.

in previous years, large numbers of
college men have had no deﬁnite plans
nor the slimmer when leaving college
at the end or tho second senrcstcr, and,
either thrrr indrttereucc or neglect,
have railed to land a iob or do any
thing which might bc considered use-
ful thriiout the warm months. in 1917,
such plans would iierer have been
g en a passing thought by the prion
itr or people. In iris, however, condir
tions are very dittcrciit; in tact. exact-
ly the rcverso. To remain idlc now
would he treason to the nation, to the
cause or the world war.

Many cities are organizing hrnuchcs
oi their detective systems. to spy out
idlers, to put the slackers at no :, ior
a complete and thorn organization oi
‘labol' is one of the mF-ans by which
the war will eventually be won.

. riorrsly doriht ii there arc any
intentional idlcrs rli Grinncll. At least
none have been discovered. not therc
are those in Gl'milell, as there arc in
are , college and irnivorsi , 7, who have
started the year with noble intentions
and high ambitions, but who, with the
