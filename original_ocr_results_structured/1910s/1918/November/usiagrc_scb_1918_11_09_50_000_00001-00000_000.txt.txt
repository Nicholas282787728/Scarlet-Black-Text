to

Chinese and Amei can idcals of de—
mocracy, and its essential education
were discussed by Mr. Poliug Chang,
in his lecture Wednesday ciening at
Herrich chapel. Mr. Chang is Pi'Csir
dent of Nalikai college at Ticntsin. lie.
with three othcr Chinese educators,
has been touring this country, under
special government protection.

“As m China‘s government,” be de-
clared, “as nominally we call iL a me
public it must be. I don't believe any
Chinese, even foes, will dare to bee
establish a monarchial form of gov:
ernincnt, because they know it is im—
possible.

Mnst Hare Freedom.

'“But in order to have an idcal form,
we must have freedom. In order to
have this we must have \vellreducated
men. But are the Chinese ready? I
say 'no.’ There is the problem."

\ Brieﬂy he pictures the ancient eﬂur
cational system of Confucius, coiiipan
ing it with the modern cuiiiculum. But
to counteract the formalizing tendency
of Chinese education he said stimulus
must lic gained from foreign countries

Chinese Stlltly Our Methods.

“Chinese students come to the United
steers,” he said. ”not only to get my
formation, but inspiration. to get the
spirit or this free people.

”Also we come to this ‘country to
study the system of education and find
the system is no system,” he declared.

Deﬁnes Democracy.

“th deﬁnition of deinocracy,’_' he
said in closing. “is a government in
which the ruler or the people govern
ed, are not selﬁsh for themselves, but
for others. True democracy consists
in the true spirit of sacriﬁce accorde
ins to the teaching of the Lord Jesus
Christ." ‘

A reception was held for hfr. Chang
and his colleagues in the quadrangle
drawing room, after the lecture. Face
ulty nieiiibcrs, students and towns-
people met the visitot-s.‘ ‘

Last Saturday.

Coach Russel Tollefso‘n and sixteen

iai ‘Ly rcgular left for Cedar Itapid
last night at is. a, where they hattlc
the Coe collcgc aggregation today. The
men were due to ai c at Hotel ilonte
rose, Cedar Rapids, about 9:30 last
ii lit and as there will be no rereille
for them this morning. they will so
into the game fresh and frisky. The
rest of the squad follows this morning
on the hi. in St. L.’ut 7:35.
.Ttlcrc has been no sliiftiiig in the
llllevllp dining the past voeh and the
team facing Cnc will be the same that
dtt'catcd Drake a neck ago. aniicr
and Gettvs will start at elll'l; Osgood
and \l‘intoi's, tackles; Longnecltor and
Miller, guards; Lcmlei, center. The
hacinicld, Fraser will start at quarter
the Johnnie Johnson and steam will
probably iii-cal: into the line-up before
tbc game is over; Crane at lull with
no 'and Macy holding down the two
llalltrbdcli berths. J. c. Johnson, Carl
Johnson and Taylor were in the var-
s y squad that ielt last night and may
chalt into the ganic at some stage.

The Coc game today is doped to be
‘a right to the ﬁnish. Three regular
last year varsity men and three of last
season's subs are in the Coe lineup
and the tcnin plays a good brand oi
football. Coe held the formidable

Cornell team to a scoreless tie and‘
the game today will give us an idea oi.

what to expect from the Mt. Vernon

After a slump at the ﬁrst of the
week due tu'vaccilialion, the local
team settled down the last few days
and showed some real ﬁghtithe hind
that beat Dralic Saturday a'nd ought to
beat Coo today. Due to the victory
over Di-alte, the scarlet and black var—
sity will enter the Geo gridiron today
with the odds in their favor and with
added pop to right.
