d , college atmosphere is so diiiercnt

He goes on to eyplaiii that when he
was in college a large portion oi his
surplus tune was given over to the
reading oi good hooks, and to the dis l
cussion oi pertinent questions with his
icllow students, hoth oi which SLIlnuT}
lated in him a desire to think iii-oh.
leina thrii to a possible solution. The ,
average college student oi today, hasl
no time ior such things. All his spare
moments are taken up with sorcallcd
"outside activities." 1i he succeeds in
reading more than one hook it month,
in addition to his regular, assigned
work, he considers he has done well.
