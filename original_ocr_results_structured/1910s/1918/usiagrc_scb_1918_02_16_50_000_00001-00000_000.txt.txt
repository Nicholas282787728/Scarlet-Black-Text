Election oi charter members to the
"Glilmell Cap zuld Guwn" society will
be held by the senior women next
Tuesday evening in the Quadrangle

tailed working plans of the organiza-
tion will not bc determined until at

The members who will be chosen at

(1) integrity of charcctev, (2) helpful
Illﬂllellce on senior students, (3) leada

Rigid scholastic attainments us well
as high slanflctl'ds of personal illﬁua
cnce nnd lccdcrship will be taken into
strict consideration. One ﬁfth or the
senior women are elcgible for election
on the scholarship requirement.

The society will be founded on a
plan similar to the one in use by the
“Mortar Board” at the University at
Wisconsin and "Cap and Gown" at
Leland Stanford, and an attempt will
be made to ariilratc the Grinnell chapr
tcr, which is merely local at present,
with the one at the western ulllverslly.
One of the outstunding features which
may be copied from the Madison
