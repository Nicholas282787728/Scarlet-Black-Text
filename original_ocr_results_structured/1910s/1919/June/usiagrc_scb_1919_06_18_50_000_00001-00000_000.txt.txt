HASS PI‘LOTS SOARLET I
TRAOKSTARSFOR I 920‘

Sophomore Member of American
Team Is Unanimous Choice
Of r.lieammzttes.

Karl "l.iglllniilg" ﬂass, Glillilell's‘
great sprinter, w , elected captain oi
the Scarlet and Black track team ior'
next season at a recent meeting of the
letter men.

Although Hass will be but a Junior
next season, his choice was unanimous
as a result of the great record whrch'
has made this year. Star-ting at the
beginning of the season practically
unknown, he hung upon his belt so
many illustrious scalps that be was
chosen as a member or the Unrtedi
States team to the inter-allied games
and is now in France. '

Hass’ hrst conquest came at the
Drake relays, when he won the spec‘ial
100 yard event from a ﬁeld of the best
sprinters in the west, chief among
whom were Johnson oi Michigan, Had-
dock of Kansas and Butler of Du-
bnque, At the Pennsylvania relays the
week following. he placed third to But-
ler. and Haddock, all thrc men being
separated only by inches.

The Grinnell ﬂash walked away with
both dashes in the pines and Nebraska
duals. duplicated his performance in
the state meet, and ﬁnished the season
by drubbing Haddock unmercifully, to-
gether with all other Missouri Valley
runners, at the conference classic at
Ames. The crowning triumph of all,
however. came directly after the M. V.
meeting, when a group of conference
coaches got together and sent a rec-
ommendation that Hass be placed on
the list of United States athletes to go:
to France,

A shipload of American runner-s
landed in France June 12. and altho
no personal word has been received.
it is thought that Hass is among them.
Grinnell fans will be hearing of his
activities soon, for the American
team is so large that elimination trials
will be run soon Lo choose the three
men for each event.
