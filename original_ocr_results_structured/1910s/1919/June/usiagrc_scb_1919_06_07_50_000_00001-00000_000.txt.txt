MANY 0F SQUAD TO RETURN

TO SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER.

Only Two Seniors on This Year‘s
‘ Squad Are Stock and ,
Gowden. ' i

Grinnell's track season as a member
of the ilisscuri Valley Coniercuco, just :
ﬁnished, has been a season or almostl
continual victories on the cindcr path. I
A team which was well balanced
enough in capture all dual meets and
which included on its roster enough»
lndivrdual stars to capture places in'
the larger meets made this success;
mssible.

The season opened with the Drake
relays in which Grinnell, competing‘
in the University section, succeeded in
carrying off ﬁrst honors among the
foremost universities oi the middle,
west. The local team amassed a total
or nine points in Lhree races. the 100
yard special which Karl Hass, Grin-
nell's speed artist, won from such men
as Johnson of inabigan, Haddock of
Kansas, and Sol Butler of Dubuque;
second in the hall-mile relay and
fourth in the mile relay.

Grinnell Willa Every Dual.

Two weeks later the Scarlet andl
Black athletes won a close dual meet
lrom Amos 691/. to all/p. The Cyclones
annexed the distances as usual, while
Grinnell was especially strong in the
dashes and relays.

The Nebraska dual, held on the local
held May 11), resulted in an easy vic-
tory (or the Grinnell squad, the. ﬁnal
score giving Grinnell a 41-point lead
over the 36%: counters which Ne-
braska was able to collect. McMahon
of Nebraska was the sensation of the
day, winning the 440 in 49 4/5.

' Sham MM Anuexed.

The triumph of the season for the
local team was the State Meet at Des
mines, May 24, whcih Grinnell won‘
with a ﬁfteen-point lead over their
nearest rival. '

i The Missouri valley meet held at
Ames a week ago Saturday concluded[
the season for Crinnell, ‘altho until
Hasa' departure for Paris‘ to compete
in the inter-allied games Coach Huft
had intended to send a team to com-
pete in the Western Conference meet
at Chicago. in the Missouri Valley,
Grinncll and Ames tied tor third place.
Local enthusiasts had hoped to place‘
at least second, but several upsets in
the dope shoved Grinnell down sev-
eral notches. Evans who was expect-
ed to take second place in the low
slicks, stumbled on the ﬁrst hurdle
and altho he rim a magniﬁcent race
thereafter, was only able to pull into!
third place.

Better Next Your.

Altho this‘season's record is good.
local tans are looking lor even better
results next year. Cowdcn and Stock
are the only two members of the
squad who graduatc, and when Sprint
1920, rolls around, Grinnell will have
Captain Minty and Crane in the 440.
Hass in the sprints, Evans and Hoyt
in the low hurdles, vinsel in the high
sticks, broad jump and pole vault, ‘
Boehmler in the pole vault, Richards}
in the baldmllc, Secbrist in the mile,
Gordon in the tweemile, Winter, Dau—
hcnberger and Herriott in the weights,
and two relay teams the equal at this
year’s quartets. Doesn't sound bad,

does it?

GATTY SELLARS GIVES FREAK
[NTEAN NESITAL THURS. NIGHT

Owing to tho multitudinous happen—
ings, musical and otherwise, a rather
small audience attended the concert
given by Getty Sellars, the English
organist, at Herrick Chapel of Thurs-
day evening.

Mr. Scllars does not pretend to any-
thing of a higher musical expression,
and of course his renditions did not
excel in musicianship. His program
was clearly intended for entertain—
ment, and in his descriptive numbers
was clover, demonstrating a type or

oped by the moving picture shows in
larger communities. Thé audience
