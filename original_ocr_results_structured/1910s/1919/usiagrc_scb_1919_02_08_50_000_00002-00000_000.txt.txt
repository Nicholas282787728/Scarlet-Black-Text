“Plity hztrd all the Lima tn \VIN and
aim at the hlghest.”

A ieiictiouiil'y period of ludllfel‘elice
is bound to ioilow a time oi such in.
tensity as Gl’lunell, particularly the
men at Grinnel‘l, experienced last
semeslci' during the existence of the
S T. This is inevitable. But
such it spirit, or, rather, hick 0t silil'lLi

may zii'ltot a certain propoltion ol’ the ‘

population ot any college to an alto-
gether too marked degree. The no .
suit at pleasure merely ior pleasure
alone and an lndllterenco to the higher
purposes tor which the college is
maintained occupy too prominent a
place in the lives of many.

No battle “'le ever won by an army
standing "ht rest“. Not even a foot-
ball championship was ever annered
during “time out.”

gridiion championship of Iowa. it she

The writer wishes to take issue with
a certain communication which was
piloted in the last issue oi the Scarlet
and Black supporting the cause of the
conservatives or as a recent editorial
in the same paper has so aptly ex,
pressed it “the reactionary group."

Any group in any community which
optics-es improvements until the want
oi these improvements has worked
real hardships on the iiieiiihers of that
community is a dangerous element
and its intluenee should he kept ill
checlt.

There is no doubt that precedents
and ti aditiuns are in many (1‘ es
valuable as guides to luturc conduct,
hut everyone realizes that conditions
are continual~ changing, that rules
which were propei loi our rauieis are
entirely out oi place when applied to
nlolnhors ol' the present generation.

The writer oi the communication
mentioned above admits that the con-
lservatives are a small minority. Most
;ot us are, 1 am Sul'e, Very glad that
!they are. But the author continues
by saying that altho the conservatives
,are a small minority they are entitled
Ito their opinions and have a right to
refuse to support "the rash and im-
,petuous action" or the more radical
,inemhers. He is right in stating that
