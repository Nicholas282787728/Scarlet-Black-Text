To show that Iowa “is not the place
betwccn the cornﬁeld and the chicken
coop", as Ellis Barker Butler describ—
ed it was the object of Mr. Harlan of
the state Historical Department in a
Friday morning chapel talk. He spoke

the efforts being made to develop Iowa
literature and record Iowa’s literary
Progress.

Correspondence with Ellis Parker
Butler in regard to his Work was read
by Mr. Harlan, the above quotation be.
ing taken from one of the famous hu—
morist's letters. Mr, Butler was born

Meek-s oration euttiled “Prince Met—

He pointed out that when Mettcrnich

UNPAID WAR PLEDGES
WILL BE SULLEGTED

Committes Appointed To Visit
Each Subscriber — Forty
Per Cent Unpaid.

The drive for final collection of the
United War Pledges among the men
and women of the college was started
Thursday with an announcement by
er. Blank, secretary of the fund, to
tho effect that all pledges not paid
had to be accounted for inside of the
next Week in order that the entire un-
dertaking may bet settled by July ﬁrst.

Committees oi men and women were
appointed to see each subscriber per-
sonally and to make arrangements
with him as to his ability to meet the
pledge. Reports from the committees
seem to indicate that the results are
very favorable, and that most of thc
pledges will be paid in by the stated
time.

To data about sixty per cent of the
men’s pledges and cighty per cent of
the women's pledges have bccn cul.
lcctcd. The number of men leaving
college after their discharge from the
s. A. T. C. was partly a cause for the
deﬁciency, and the fact that no active
drive for payment has been made till
now has something to do with the
slowness in paying up the subscrip-
tions.

ENIIBWMENT FUN!
PASSESﬂiﬂﬂ MARK

Living Endowment Fund Is New
Alumni Project Started
Month ‘Ago.

For the ﬁrst month of the ﬁrst year
or the new endowment plan known as
tho Living Endowment Fund, the corn
tributicns have I'eztchéd the amount
of $1,269.50, according to a statement
received from the secretary of the
Graduate Council this morning. This
amount is the rcsult'of contribuuons
of thirty diftcrent 'classes of alumni.
Figuring on the basis of 5%% this is
the equivalent in its usefulness to the
college of a permanent endowment
of $23,082.00.

The Living Endowment Fund is dis—
tinctly an alumni project carried out
by the Graduate Council. The com-
paign started on May 5. The great
advantage of the plan is that any
Grinnellian who might wish to give the
college, say two hundred dollars but
can not afford it, may pay it in yearly
installments of any size he wishes.
Another valuable feature of the plan
is that the contributions give full
amount for immediate service instead
of merely interest as is the case with
permanent endowments. The con-
trihutur may also designate the partic—
ular object for which he wishes his
gift spent, The giftsat present are
distributed as follows: War Memorial.
$117.00; Alumni Scholarship, $203.0
General, 535 .50; Teachers' Salaries.
$35.00; and Special, $62.00; making a.
total of $1,269.50.

Mr. Vernon’D. Blank, seCi'elary of
the Graduate Council, said, “This is
to he a permanent campaign. It has
started out as a success and in the
future there is no question but that
it will he one of the most signihcant
parts of the financial program.”

Road’s Grandfather
Has First Spring
Wagon In County

,It was in the days when Poweshick
county was still in a state of semi-
civiliaatiop, before a college came to
Grluncll, that a farmer from Icifcrson
township came to town and took home
with him a light spring wagon. other
farmcrs driving to town with their on
warns looked at him as he passcd by.
and some significantly tapped their
heads, as it to say “Nobody home.“
Some admired, some envied. The name
of the progressive farmer who tool:
home that day the ﬁrst spring wagon
to be owned in the community was
Read, grandfather of Lieut. Com-
mander A, C. Read, commander of the
naval seaplane Not.

In making tho ﬁrst aerial trip across
the Atlantic Lieut Read was but rol-
lowiug in the footsteps of his worthy
progenitor. Blood will tell,

Lieutenant Comniaudcr Road of thc
NC-l never lived in Poweshiek county
but his father and grandfather did,
making a name for themselves as peo-
ple of progrcss. On this account Pow.
eshiek county can claim a share of
glory, and can put Read in the hall of
fame along with Robinson, I-Iall, aud
other famous airmen.

THINKING DITITH BIGGER MAY'
BE EDUSATED SAYS BENNETT

"To be educated is to have a work-
ing hand and a thinking mind," was
the statement made by Miss Helen
Bennett, Intercollegiate Secretary of
Occupations, in chapel Thursday
morning. “A thinking ditch digger
may be educated," she smted.

Miss Bennett believes that every\
valuable piece of work is done thru‘
education. The price of land varies
with the trained man who cultivates
it; national prohibition is brought
about thru education.

“Vocational training is learning to
do something," she stated. Miss Eeu—

nett advocates vocational training for
