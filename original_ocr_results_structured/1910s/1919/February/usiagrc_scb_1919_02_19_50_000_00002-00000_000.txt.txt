In a recent issue oi a well-known
Iowa college new Japer the statement
was made tho "it is poorly imposs
sihle tor a college publication to lay
dawn certain policies."

Right here, we want to disagree
most lioar ly with this editor. It is
true that we cannot hope to revalu-
tionize the whole life ot the instituo
tiou by any deﬁnite stand, nor do we
care to do so. but we believe that it
is possible to state and to re-state cere
tain policies which in our opinions and
in the opinions 0[ our tellow students
will have tor their ultimate purpose
the Ilpbilildillg and the strengthening,
phy socially, and morally. or
that institution.

Just as a political party must have
a platter , and a city daily must have
a certain set of principles upon which
to’ work, a college newspaper, if it ful-
ﬁlls the whole duty of its mission. must
lay dow a set at policies. and work
toward their accomplishment They
may seem trivial '1] comparison to the
plattorm and policies of the two asem
cies just mentioned, but nevertheless
they look toward the same purpose,
the betterment af conditions for the
public concerned. What would any
paper look lite if it sought never to
oppose the will of even the minority
tor rear of incurring their disapproval,
even the such opposition would prove
beneﬁcial to the majority? Perhaps
the writer of the editorial quoted above
did not have in mind such a radical
stand, but_ an analysis at his words
seems to indicate such an opinion.

We have known o1 instances. audl
'We have known of instances, will

many of them. where college papers
have helped change conditions tor the
better in their respective institutions,
all because they took deﬁnite stands
on public questions. and we have no
doubt that similar instances will cons
tinuc or multip in the inture.

If you believe in a principle, ﬁght
for; it, and ﬁght openly and fairly, but

It has been said that ignorance oi

law is kept a close scciet by the law

Now it seems that a policy has been

According to authorities on the sub-

tion 2 group ol' 'epi‘cscnmtives workv

own interest instead of the interest
‘of the governed, can hardly be called
democracy.

Grinnell women and men also are
willing to abide by the laws if they
are reasonable and JuSL but they de-
mand full and adequate knowledge of
what they are. They resent under-
handedness.

SHOWS VALUE OF
ORGANIZATION

Professor J. D. Stoops delivered the
talk in vcspcrs last Sunday. speaking
on the subject: “Does all the increased
organization of the college today make
for a higher or lower degree 01 indi-
viduality and richness of character
than the less organized college life or
the years preceding the present de-
cadci

Quilting Roosevelt’s autobiography,
he asked the audience to see the real
signiﬁcance of organization. He
showed that the world is coming to

. see that its theory at liberty and sell-

determination would be impossible it
’the world were not organized politi—
,chlly, socially, and otherwise. He tier
clared that outside influences made
our life, and asked whether the pres-
entrdzty student is accomplishing more
ivith the complex organized social lite
surrounding hini than he would if
there were no such institutions as the
=qiiadiangle, dormitories, library, or
i gymnasium.

He said that we should be couscio
of the cvei‘rchanglug relations in our
world, and should be able to adjust
,oursclres to them and then to control
them for the hotter or worse, so that
lwc can keep raising the standard cl
life.

-He emphasized the tact that big
things happen now because of the
pi , ure ot outside circumstances and
conditions, and that the social hie oi
the educated people was on a much
higher level than that of the iincdii-
catcd class because oi this tact,
