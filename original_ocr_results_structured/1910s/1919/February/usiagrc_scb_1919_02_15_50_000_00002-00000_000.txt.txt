it has been said that "story-thins

comes to him who traits." But ottcn

'it 1s'a long, tedious trait, and “he”
must lcaie without having obtained
that or which he was in quest.

Judgllig from p1cscnt appearances,
many men 11 ill lcaie collcgc next .lnnc'
hat-me 111 ed in no othei Giinncll home
than "Building 011e," “Building Two,"
etc. Such names, a. suggestcd re
csntly by “Another Altlliiuus,“ are sug-
gesthe ot pii<ous and insane as inns,
and remarkably rcscinblc “padded cell
9863." They carry no special signin-
rancc to the dormitory man, and they
fall with a deadening thud on the car
or the prospective student.

Tmic and again we have been as»
sored that the buildings would he
named, and Lime and again we have
coibed our impaticnce, thinking mat
soon we could more out or Building
One, or Two, or whatever the case
may have been, and unpack. our grip
in — Hall, or A House, or even

.— Lodge. But the sun still contin-
ues to rise on the cast ot the “Build-
lugs" and to set on the west ot the
structures hearing the name name.

When will the dormitories be
namedl That question has otten becn.
ashed, btit rt trill hear repeating.
WHEN will they be named?

—,G’__
PEP.
' Yes, the name or this editorial is
“PEP.” ‘

The wo1d, in its1abb1-cv1ated form,
was unknown to Noah Webster, bot 1t
might be deﬁned as “thatn1ate1‘ial sub.
stance or vital element that was
noticeably absent thruout 911% or the
Teachers game."

111 thc opening of the game the rcl-

trength ot the two lives was
so we “tallicd it up" to the

,team, Soon it was appaicnt that Grin-
ncll tar outclassed tho northerncrs, so
we sottlcd been on the hcnchcs intent
oul) on watching a game that seemed
to be “011 Ice." And thus ended the
111st halt.

When play was rcsumcd, we main-
taincd the same attitude. It even seem-
ed to lime aitcetcd the tcam to as
great, or or on greater, a degree.
“Overconl eiicc, That was us all
cm." 11 tictory had at that time de-
pnndcd on tbe‘silciicc ot the rootcrs,
no team on caitli could have beaten
Gi'innell. But when Cedar Falls bc-
gan'to climb, seriously threatening om-
chances to winning ,wc began to “pop
up.” he plead with the team to
“drop it 111 , and we iinally cmcrgcd
with a hair-incadth vict_o1-.y

all the time. There's never a let-lip,
never a pause.

“Tall; it up" when we are behind, to
he sure, but “up and at ’em” in the
same way when we are in the lead. No
gamc was over won until the ﬁnal
crack of the gun.
