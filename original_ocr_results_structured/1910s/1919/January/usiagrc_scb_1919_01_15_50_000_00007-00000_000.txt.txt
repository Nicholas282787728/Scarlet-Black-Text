Lower Floor of East Wing Made
Into Laboratory for Use
of Women.

New additions have been made to
the Blair Hall chemistry laboratories
and improvements made to the old
ones until there is now room to accom-
modate over three hundred students
at one time in the laboratories. New
apparatus has been installed and new
ventilating appliances have been put
into use so that the laboratories have
now become one of the best equipped
of any of the colleges in Iowa.

The entire ﬁrst iloor has been made
into laboratories since the removal of
the Botany department to the former
Associations building and ,all new
equipment has been put into these new
sections. ‘ In the east wing or the
building a new laboratory has been
equipped for classes in general chem-
istry and will be used by the women.
New desks, lockers and apparatus have
been installed here including a motor—
yentilated hood for the experiments
with noxious gases. New blackboards
have been placed along the west wall.
Another feature or this laboratory is
that 'running water, compressed air,
and gas [aucets are at each desk, and
to every two Llcsks is a sink.

0n the north side or the building is
a new laboratory for the advanced slu~
dents in analytic worb. Connected
with it is a room with supply shelves
containing the various acids and chem-
icals necessary for the Work.

The old laboratories on the ﬁrst.
second, and third lloors of the west
wing have been improved by the m-
stallation of motor hoods for the draw-
ing oil or poisonous ‘gases. The base—
ment room on the west will for the
present remain unchanged, but the
basement room on the east is being
ﬁtted up ior experiments in electrical
chemistry. The upper stories or the
east wing are still being used for
zoology laboratories and lecture
rooms.

These new laboratories have been
under construction for some time and
will he opened to the chemistry classes
in the near tuture. The ﬁrst floor lab-
oratories tor the women have been
made with deslrs three inches lower
and with a view towards the most
convenient arrangement to cause the
least number. of steps.
