overseas.

England, Scotland and Ireland most of
the time, but was finally sent to
France. He stated that the soldiers
were very well ted. "We usually had

get food in England than in France,
because England sent most or her sup-
plies to her men in France. We could
not get much beef in France but we
got lots of mutton."

Mr. Williams told or the hitchens
used in the army. “In England we
usually had a tent and once in a while
an old frame building. In France we
had a ﬁne hilclrcn huilt in the back
end of a motor truck, so we could
move whenever necessary. We were
