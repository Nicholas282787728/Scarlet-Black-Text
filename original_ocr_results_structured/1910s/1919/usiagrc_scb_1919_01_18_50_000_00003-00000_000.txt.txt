TRUSTEES PROMISE
Fﬂﬂll IMPROVEMENT

Student Council Inthigation Re-
sults i‘.n Men’s Meeting at
Dormitories.

At a meeting or the men of the three
upper classes, tor the purpose of dis-
cussing means ior improvement in
dormitory management, particularly
in the matter of the load situation in
the men’s dormitories, held Thursday
night in the Clllbsl'oom of Building 11!,
a committee was appointed to fol-mus
late resolutions to be presented to the
college trustees. Friday evening, af-
ter dinner, another meeting was held,
at which announcement was made by
Prof. H. W. Matldck, Dean ot Men,
that the trustees were planning to
take immediate steps to improve exist
ing conditions.

A committee or the student council,
appointed some time ago to investigate
the food situation in both the men's
and the Women's dormitories, was in—
formed by the present college manage»
mcnt that every possible eiiort was
being made to maintain good condis
tions. The committee, not thinking
that this answer was deﬁnite enough.
approached the college trustees with a
request :or investigation. As the
trustees did not seem to thinlr the stu-
dent council committee as sufiiciently
representative oi the strident body, the

‘Ilzly night was held for
the purpose oi electing a special con)»
inittee to support and carry on the
worlr initiated by the strident council.

The men seemed in favor or separ-
ate management oi the men's and won
men's dormitories. General dissatis—
iaction witl_ the food situation was
expressed and a desire for improve
ment evideit, At. the meeting last
night, Mr. Natlack 5th that the trus-
teeos were ready to take any neces-
sary steps voward making conditions
more acceptable to the men.

The studeit committee has begun ine
vestigatlonsot iood situations in other
dining places, The resolution of this
committee requesting investigation by
the college was deferred tor the pres—
ent upon hc promise of the trustees
oi immediite action, ‘ 2

men in school who played in any of
thc games last year, but they were
not used regularly.

Evans, a sophomore. appears to he
the best bet for the other forward po»
sition, altho Cztlesun is putting up a
fast gums, and hooking the ball thru
the ring with dangerousregularity.
Sauerinan is the other candidate tor
a berth at the reward job, but the
other men seem to have the edge on
him at present.

Gettys, stock. and H. Daubcnbergci-
are being worked at the pivot position
in an ciiort to develop a center who
can play the defensive and offensive
ends oi the game equally well, All
three men are oi the sixsfoot variety
and are able to get the tip-oft over’
their opponcnm, Altho no deﬁnite
choice has been made as to who will
have the job. Gettys looks the best to
haslret ball tans.

Gum-ti Bertlis Uncertain.

The dopesters are having a hard
time predicting who will hold down the
defensive positions on this year’s rive.
Winters, Lion, and Wells are about on
a par and play a rast agressivc game.
Winters will probably occupy one or
the guards since he is tall and rangy
and is able to break up long passes.
For the other berth it is about a toss-
up between Linn and Wells, and the
man who stands up best under ﬁre
will get the place.

Varsity practice began last Monday
atternoon at 4:30 o‘clock under the di—
rection of “Doc” Hurt, No permanent
coach has been secured as yet and
“Doc" will handle the team until some
one is obtained. "Doc” coached the
last state championship quintet turned
out here in 1914,

Hold Short Scrimmages.

The practice so tar has been mostly
preliminary with a short scrimmage
Each day. The squad has been cut
down to about twelve men and next
week two or three or these will be
dropped. Passing the ball and shoot-
iug baskets irom all angles and posi-
tions and woik in dribbling takes up
most at the practice period at the pres-
ent time, The scrimmages are short
and snappy.

The members oi the squad have been

owing plenty oi pep and tight, but

The dreary wail comes from the th d
