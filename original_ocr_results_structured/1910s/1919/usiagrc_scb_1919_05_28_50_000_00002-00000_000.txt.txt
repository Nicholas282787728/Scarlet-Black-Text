SOCIAL DESTITL HON.
We wish to congratulate the "tormer

s. & E. editor" whose cohlllinnicntion;

appeared in last Saturday's Cditinl‘i of
The Scarlet and Black on his or l'emely
clever article. It Wits must sarcastic

every alumnus and alumna would be
equally as free and onenrminded in

expressing his or her opinion concern— '

ing tlle same subject, we could easily
start a discussion which would soon

The ﬁrst paragraph we will pass
lightly over. It is an exaggeration,#
even' he himseli would admit that, ex—
cept the statement that “over-wpl'keti

social committees will no longer ﬁndi
it necessary to think up diversiﬁed‘

ways or providing entertainment"
True indeed, the ways have been di—
vel'siﬂed._ After the dinner party, we
could adjourn t0 the muvies. or, as we
said once ,het‘ore, we could go to the
movies. At the class or society parties,
we canld Vplay winkv‘cm, attend the
county fair, or attire ourselves as ht)—

to some or our readers. an attractive
social lite is a great advertisement rol-

attend college merely to learn hooks.
Learning to know people. 7 1 there

equally as essential, and this cannot he
developed without an adequate social
lite.

We are not criticising the academic
side or Grinnell. That is beyond re-
proaeh. We are, however, asking tor
a social life which will correspond
with it ravorably. We are no worse
than scores or other colleges, we have
been told. Perhaps not, hut shall we
told our hands in the meantime and
accept the existing state or alisirs
merely because we are as good as the
l'r‘st” Is that progressl

We aeccot the "former editor's"
criticism. Wo appreciate his interest.
llost or his suggestions, however, have
been oriered herore He seems to
rorget that more is a long period dur-
ng the winter months when "picnics
at Sugar Creek and \Vestﬁeld‘; and all
other outside activities are not in
place. “Kiri" parties, “hard time"
and "county tair" parties, as we have

.alrcady suggested. are usually only

tolerated by Gl'inllcll students.

lieving the social monotony in or

be h’ippy to adopt it.

We are dissatisﬁed with social Cons

our views. Progress can never be at;
