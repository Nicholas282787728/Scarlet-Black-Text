who spoke on the subject of Bolshev-

ice with the Y. M. C. A. in Siberia.

“The Bolshevlsts are not to blame
for what happened," added Mr. Comp-
ton. "They smrted out all right and
their battle cry or 'Liherty, Freedom,
Land, and Equality,‘ was sincere. But
the Russian people were uneducated
and did not know how to run the gays

class led them to drive out all the edu—

only treating the upper classes as tho,
upper classes had once treated them.

“The heart of the Russian trouble is

tostering this public spirit and in edu-
cating the people." '
