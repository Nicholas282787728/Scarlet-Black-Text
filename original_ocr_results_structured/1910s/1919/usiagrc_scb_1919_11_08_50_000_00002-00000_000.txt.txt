The army grabbed boxing from the

junk heap where exploited profession-
alism had brought it and rho-insulted it
in its true position.

There was not an army camp that
did not have its corps of boxing in—
structors and the men who experi-
enced army life without a taste of the
ﬁsticart were few indeed.

The army championed boxing not
only because it was a. complimentary
art to bayonet ﬁghting but also be»
cause it developed self reliance.

IL is a sport which every .Amel‘icsn
will favor.

The exhibition of boxing which was
put on at the athletic carnival Friday
night moved the interest of Gl'lnnell
men in the ancient al‘L

It demonstrated also that certain
men had acquired some degree of pro»
ﬂciency with the gloves. But why
should only few men get the advan-
tage of this trajnlng7 ,

Army experience has shown that
boxing can be successfully taught to
large groups.

A 01351 in boxing is in order.
