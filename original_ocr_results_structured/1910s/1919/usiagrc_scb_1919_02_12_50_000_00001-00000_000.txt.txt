Thc return of Evans, Hammond, and

lar place at guard. and Hammond will
resume his forward. Gettys is unable
to get out for basket ball at the pres

play forward. ”A combination which
is pcrlcctly satislactoly has not yet

recital on the organ. organ recitals
are new to Grim-loll erccpt those
given by local talent. and the Bonnet
recital was received very enthusiasti-
cally by the large audience which ﬁlled
the auditorium.

The program was opened with~thrcc
prelndes which paved the way to the
smnewhat heavier Bach numbers. The
“Prelude" by Ciel-ambault was charm-
mg in ils melodious qualities. The
Handel numbers showed many of the
variations of music and displayed the
great ability of the writer. All of thc
many parts of the organ were brought
into use 111 the rendition oi this cons

The “Choral in A minor". one of the
last three compositions by Franck, and
undoubtedly his best even tho they
were gwcn their limshing touches on
his death-bed opcncd the second part
of the program. The agitated begin-
ning soon calms down and leads up in
a remarkable manner to the humble
thcmc of the choral.

The three numbers by Bonnet himscll

“Nothing Bllt the Tnltli" 1s the play
which Forum and Philadelphica liter»
ary societies have selected for their
play to be given on the evening of
March 1.

The play was written by James 111.
Montgomery, and has been adapted
from the novel by Frederick lsham.
A review of this comedy in The l\' —
Lion says it is a most amusing farce.
Tile articlc reads:

“To Robert Bennett. partner in a
ﬁrm of stock brokers, tolls thc impos-
sible task of telling the truth for
twenty-lolli- hours, Under the inspira-
tion of a mendicant bishop, Gwendolyn
Ralston. daughter of Bennett's senior
partner, is endeavoring to raise $20.7
000 for charity, hcr closesﬁsted father
having lightly promised to double any
amount above that soul which she may
collect. Ten thousand dollars repre
sents all she can collect and this sum
she brings to Bennett with the triﬂing
request that he double it in two days
by investing it in some sate specula-
tion. The problem appears insuper
ablc until Bennett, in protest against
his senior partner's methods of d'snos—
ing of doubtful stock is drawn into an
argument which results in a bet of
,sllwoo being made that he will not
tell the exact truth under every cil'e
cumstauce for a period of twenty-four
hours.

The wealth of material for farcical
purpose which the situauon aflords is
