ProL L. D. l-lartson, who is now in
Lyons, teaching English to Frenchmen
in a Foyer du soldat, writes of his
interesting experiences while on leave.
Extracts from the letter follow:

Quai Jules Gourmont
YIODS.
April, 1919.

It happened that the ”Centre" at
Gannat closed two weelrs earlier than
was anticipated, so my "permission"
began correspondingly early. This
was my itinerary: Paris to St. Jean
de Luz, from which point I visited
Biarritz, Bayonne, and Henduyl on the
Spanish border. My next stop was at
Pau, and here I was so fortunate as to
get an auto ride to Eaux Brunes,
among the snowscapped Pyrenees.

. Then through Lourdes to Luchon, on
a glorious crisp morning. 1» climbed
to the Spanish rrcnn‘er. the last halt-
hour through two ieet 01 snow. On
to Toulouse and Caroassonne, this an-
cient walled city proving to be per-
haps the most interesting city visited.
The different strata or historic
epochs are so clearly revealed in the
city walls and towers; and the church,
such a -picturesque combination or
Romanesque and Gothic.

At Avignon.

Then, alter an hour on the ducks at
Cette, two interesting days in the
Green-Roman environment at Nimes
and Aries, I wanted to spend sev-
'eral weeks in this region, so rich in
ancient history, but could stay only
two days, the last ot which I spent
at Avignon. It may be news to you

that the Palace of the Popes here has ‘

been used during the War as it store»
house {or money and precious jewels
brought from Paris. And the chateau
at Carcassonne still conﬁnes German
prisoners. I cunversed with some
Boche officers over the walls or one
of the forts here, the other day.

The last beautiful spring afternoon
of my “permission" I motored to. the
Font du Gard in company with an in~
teresting M. P. and three Red Cross
girls. ,

I am ﬁnding the work at Lyon more
absorbing than anything I have. done
before in France, and the time will
pass rapidly between now and July
ﬁrst. then, in all probability, it will

‘ be “ﬁnish". as many Fruhmen here
have learned to say.
Out By July 1.

After July ﬁrst, the word is, only
seventy—ﬁve Americans will he re-
tained in ﬁance in the Foyers du
soldat.

I live in the largest barracks in
France, le Cuseme'de la Forte-Die“,
Where we have three locals. My PM“
ocular responsibility is the educa-
tional work: but, as in settlement
work, one has many buslness details
to look after, in addition to his spec-
ialty. '

As yet I haven't explored the city
much I know there are many inmr—
testing historic, artistic, and economic
places to be gotten acquainted with.

I trust that you in Grinnell will tin-
ish the year pleasantly and that your
"permission"'will pass auspiciously.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Thoughtless Pe‘ople
Damage Bot. Gardens

Considerable damage has been done
to the botanical gardens south of the
campus, by thoughtless people, who
have picked the ilowers and otherwise
damaged the many specimens there.
The work on these gardens was de-
layed by the shortage at labor due to
war conditions, but will be renewed

Shortly. It is hoped that with the
improvements that are planned that
Grinnellians will take the same inter-
est in the gardens 'that they‘ would in

The botanical gardens were given to
the department of botany for expel-is
mental purposes in 1908. Along With
the plot of ground a. small endowment
fund for the upkeep of the gardens
was given. Since then, turn gifts and
purchases of plants, the number of
specimens has been increased until
at the present time there are nearly
500 plants represented.

Recently the botanical gardens
have received valuable gifts from the
Shenandoah Nursery Co. and the Mt.
Arbor Nursery CO. at Shenandoah,
Iowa. Numerous specimens have also
been obtained from the annual dis.
