Drake Stadium.
GRINNELL OUTPLAYS OPPON-

ENT IN THREE QUARTERS

Near Riot Over Sign In Firstl

Quarter Adds Interest to l

the Game. l

After car in; the ball to Drake’s
thl'eeryal‘d linc four times in tlle‘
last three quarters, inability to make
further gains caused Gl'll‘mell's s to 0
defeat at the Drake Sldrlillm Satin»,
day. A near riot/cycl- the “Grin-Kucll"
sign after Drake's touchdown enliven,
ed the afternoon's festiVllies.

Drake scored on a series of line
smashes and one short forward pass
early in the ﬁrst quarter. After that
lone touchdown the Blue and White
aggregation never threatened. Not
once during the second and third

in Grmnell’s danger zone, and only

for a short time in the first and last

periods did the Bulldogs succeed in

getting on Scarlet and Black ground.
Ilse Many Passes.

Varied formations of the Minnesota
shift kept the Bulldogs on edge cons
stantly. Particularly successful were
the Grinnell forward passes. As Drake
was apparently afraid to use forward
passes more than twice, one of which
was successful, the Blue and White
eleven was compelled to rely on line
smashes and end runs for ground
gnins. Frequent penalties for ofisiilcs
were common to both teams.

After the Bulldogs’ touchdown,
Drake’s sign behind the north goal
was turned over, and "Grill-Kllell”
was exposed to the eyes of the Fio-
lleer motors. Cress Hoyt, Oskaloosa
high school football coach and incinhcr
of Gl-inncll's loll slate championship
a3 rcgation, lcd Grinncllians to the
sign and destroyed it. Drake followers
rushed from their scats, and a battle
royal started. Police intervention
stopped whnt would hive been a riot
and what might have l ien up the
twenty-ﬁfth annual Gi-inncll-Drake
gridiron classic.

Dralic Scar-cs.

Glinnell kicked off to Drake, who
elected to defend the south goal. shaw-
vcr caught Parker's kick and returned
the hall to the Drake eighteen-yard
line. Linc smashes and 'plnnges coup-
led with one short forward pass, drove
Grinnell hack to her one-yard line.
snawver went over on the next play.
As the touchdown was made near the
sidelines, Niggcnieycr Diluted out, and
a second later failed to kick goal from
an angle.

Twice in the second quarter the Pio-
neers we inside the Drake ﬁve-yard
line, Early in this period a Drake
player was caught holding a Grinnell
man, and the pigskin was given to
the Pioneers on Drake’s thirty-ﬁve
yard line. Several line smashes and
many forward passes carried the ball
to the Drake four-yard lino, Drake
intercepted the next pass and worked
itself out of danger. Gl'innell again
got on the Drake foniuyard line to—
ward the last of this quarter. A for
ward pass following a double pass was
incomplete. It went over the goal line
for a touchback. giving Drake the pig-
skin ou its twenty-yard line. Here
Minty replaced Captain Macy, who was
injured.

Plimoers’ Advnnw Stopped.

Macy was back in the lineup when
the second half started. Nissemcyer
kicked off to Grinnclrs twenty-yard
line, and Macy returned it eighteen
yards, Line bucks, end runs and for—
ward passes worked the hall to use
Drake six-yard line, where the Pier
neers were held for downs by the Bull-
dogs' stonewall defense. Later in this
period Grinncll grabbed the hall on
Drake’s forty-one yard line, and thru
Markley's punt worked it up to Drake’s
thirteen-yard line. .

Minty replaced Schultz at the start
of the fourth quarter. After Grinnell
had worked the pigskin to Drake’s
twentyaﬁve-yal'd line on forward pass—
es, Markley hit the center of the Bull-
dogs' line for a four-yard gain. A
forward puss, Winter to Parker, gained
ten yards. Mai-klcy made another yard
through the line. night more yards
were added on a forward pass, Minty
tr) Mel/are“. Markley fumbled the
hall when he hit the line, and Homa-
day of Drake recovered the hall on
his own threeyard line. Hicks re—
placed Lcrnlcy. Drake drove Grinnell
hack to its fol‘tyeﬂve yard—line. Iine
bucking and forward passes again
worked the hall toward the Drake
goal, The Pioneers were Within the
nrnke ten—yard line when the half
ended.
