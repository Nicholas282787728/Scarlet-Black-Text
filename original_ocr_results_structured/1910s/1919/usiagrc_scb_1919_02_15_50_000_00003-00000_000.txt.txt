l’IlES. WEHRHAN UF TABUR
TALKS AT BHAPEL WEDNESDAY‘

"1 pegged my way through college,"
was the rather startling admission
made by Nelson W. iVelirhan, ’06,
President or Tabor College, in chapel
last Wednesday morning. “For I was
a shoemaker. I remember how the
faculty members brought me packages
or shoes. It was hard work. You woue
der if .1 would do it again? Yes. 1
would “go through all the sacrifice
again [or those qur wonderml years
of Grinnell.”

President Wchi-hou compared the
Grinch as he knew it with Grinnell
as he ﬁnds it today. He told ol the
old chapel with the many now illus-
trious names carved on its seats.

He compared the faculty to a sculp—
tor putting the last few mechanical
touches to his work. We may think
they are crude lllachilnics rather than
artists, hut later we will appreciate
their work. "The ideal ot this college
is service," he said. "It was her-c
largely that I caught the ideal."

points in the second hell were made

getting two. Crane Missed tries from
the foul line, as did Evans, who took
Hammond’s place at the beginning of
the halt. Altho the visitors out-played
the locals during most ol the game, all

oell, and the scarlet live ﬁnally came
