MENTAL RUBBISH.

The coming of spring reminds us ot
the good old days when inother hand-
ed us a heater and showed us a carpet
of inﬁnite dimensions reposing in the
hack yard. with speciﬁc instructions to
"beat it till the dust was all gone."
And after every spring house-cleaning.
we formed resolutions — and broke.
them as quickly—that never again
would we track niud into the house. for
then, we thought, we could avoid such:
an ahoniinahic method of killing time
the next spring.

But did you ever think of mental
lubbish? Each one of us_iio excep—
tions in this case—ls overloaded with
an inﬁnite quantity of intellectual
debris. which accumulates in the re—
mote corners of our mind and ofteni
expands into the brain proper. One
day we get a letter from the college
ofﬁce which reads. “You have hecn‘
conditioned inf" Themigl'eal. gobs‘
of mud,~we realize that it‘s time for.
a mental house-cleaning. We make
resolutions. hilt again we break them. '

what do we come to college for?
Primarily/we are here to learn. but
Ieemlllgly we do all in our power to
keep from learning. if we have a
chance to cut class. we cut. If the
professor doesn't show up the minute
the last hell rings. soine "student"
who has a hankering for the greati
outrotrdooi's rather than the class
room. sets up the war cry. "Everybody
out.” if we stay at class. we spend
the hour in catching up some of the
sleep we lost the night before. We are
all more or less guilty. We spend our
doting daddy's money foriwlaat?

Grinnell.iiist as every other college
and univeisity. wants to teach us some‘
of the principles of life thru the medx
iuui of the class rooms.

it's up to you. Takethem%rleave
them. .

A large number of amateur journal-
isls should respond to the call for the
regular spring tryout of The Scarlet
and Black. whicil opcns next Tuesday
evening in Room 22 of alumni rccita-l

Previous pericnce is unnecessary.
The man or woman who takes the try»
out seriously during the next three
weeks. even the he or she has had uoi
plevious experience iii writing, will
stand an equal chance with the canle
dates ’who have spent cousithrr
chic time in newspapcr offices. The
small iiuniher of reporters to he added
to the staff should prove in no way!
discouraging. for if unsuccessful this
spring, the candidate will he [halt
much hetter ﬁtted for the tryout in the
fall.

A position on The Scarlet and Black
staff will give the reportcr a real in—
sight iiito journalistic work. It will
give a hetter insight into the affairs
around him. and will he a valuable
training in the writing of English. It
will give him a membership in the
Iowa College Press Association and
will entitle him: to attend the meetings
of the association. where he can obs
min a great deal of practical news-
paper experience at ilrst hand. Lastly.
the reporter will he eligible for elec»
tion to one or the managing positions
in his senior year.

If you are at all interested in news-
paper work, be present at the ﬁrst try—
outers' meeting next Tuesday evening.

FRIENDLINES '.
A few years ago. the ﬁrst thing that
a visitor to .Griul‘ieil college noticed

.was the good fellowship that existed
among the students.

It was one of the
distlnsulishiug features of Grinnell
life.

It was the custom. after the gen
eral reception had heen held. for
everybody to speak to everybody else.
whenever they met on the campus. if
they'were Grinnell students, it rnat-
tered not whether they had been in»
troduced or not. they met each other
as friends.

Today. the students hurry from one
class to another. having time occasion-
ally to speak to a passerby. The av—
erage man has a speaking acquaint.
ence with shout one-third of the girls
in his classes, and vice versa.

Frequently they have several classes
together. Certainly. under these con-
ditions. it would not he considered had

form for a Grinnell girl to speak to a .

Grinnell than. altho they had never
been introduced

The Grinnell students of today are
too formal. it's a little matter to
speak and it means a lot. Let's rc-
establish that old Grinnell character
istic. “Fricndliness.”
