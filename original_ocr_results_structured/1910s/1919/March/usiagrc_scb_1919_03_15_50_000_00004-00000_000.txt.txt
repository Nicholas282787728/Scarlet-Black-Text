“The best man owns the resin and
there is plenty at room tor thc right
man in any line,” said Pror. W. s,
Hendrixson in chapel Tuesday morn»
ing. This was the second or the Sex”
ies of chapel talks dealing with the
suhiect of graduate work.

“The increase in graduate work has
been phenomenal and Grinnell stur
dents are capable of cnrr‘ying gradu-
ate work," continued Prol Hendrixson,
“for the general average or scholar-
shji; in this institution is as high as it
is anywhere.”

“It is going to take higger and het-
ter men and women to run this old
World-after the war and the duty is
upon us for greater preparation for
our tasks. The United states will no
longer have to look to German univel'r
sities for research and technical work,
but will and can depend upon her own
institutions for this same work."
