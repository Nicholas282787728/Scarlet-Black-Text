Incendiary B u l 1 e t 5
Never Used by
Capt. Hall.

Tales or the chivalry of the air serv-
ice have come across to us irom the
war correspondents e but this story
has not been ain'ong them.

Altho the use or incendiary bullets
by both allied and German aviators be
came common during the closing
months or the war, Captain James
Norman Hall never used them, reluc-
tantly he admitted it yesterday.

"It always seemed to me that it was
left to the individual whether or not
he cared to use them," he said. “There
was nothing compulsory about it. it
you hit a man’s gas tank with an in-
cendiary bullet, he didn’t have a
chance, but went down in ﬂames."

“I just felt that it I couldn't get a
man with ordinary bullets I'd rather
let him live," said Hall.
