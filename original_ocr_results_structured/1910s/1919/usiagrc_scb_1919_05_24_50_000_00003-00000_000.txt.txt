lutum,” in these big songs Mlddle~
ton is at his best, and it is easy to
see how well he has earned the honor
or being chosen for grand opera.

His voice, his pi~cscnec_ and his
manner or singing are all on a broad
scale, and he has, him patient and
continued discipline or his voice, at
tained the ﬂexibility and control which
ditterentiate the artist irom the
singer.

Sings Negro Songs.

In addition to the operatic arias
mentioned above, a signidcant lecture
of Mr. Middleton's program was the

’group of songs arranged by negro
composers. Of these the most success
tul was the “Exhal'lation”, by Will
Mai-ion Cook, the leader at the'iam.
ous Syncopatcd Symphony Orchestra
at negroes. This song was very much
superior to the arrangements by Burr
icigh or old negro spirituals, for Bur-
leigh, like many others, dilutes and
spoils the native essence or the negro
melodies by accompaniments which
are techie and dilute imitations of the
most polite of contemporary drawing
room music, but Cook, on the other
. hand, keeps to the idiom at the race
in arranging negro songs, and many
who are Wise on this suhiect believe
that he is destined to make what we
uz” respectable in the concert
hall as t is popular in the Cahal‘eti
at any rate, jazz has broken into the
May Festival.

Mr. Middleton's audience did not
spare him in the matter or encores,
and insisted on an extra song at every
possible opportunity. The accompani—
ments were exceedingly well played
by Mr. Lyell Barber.

Thu Frldny Evening Concert.

The third concert was given by the
Grinnell College Orchestra and the
Women‘s Chorus. The program open-
ed with a cantata by Rosseter G. Cole,
director or the School or Muslc rrom
"The Broken Trout" Mr. Cole was
director or the School or Music fl‘om
1392 to 1901. Since leavihg Grinncll
he has given himselr to composition,
and has wiittcn several large orchesA
tral and choral works, together with
many songs and piano compositions,
all a! a high order.

The cantata presented last evening
is a legend or the Mexican border in
the old days, and was very well ren»
dered by the \Vomtan’s Chorus of about
seventy coices, under the direction or
Protessor Pierce, with solo parts by
Miss Currie and Mr. Blum, and as-

Newman, the Nebrasha entry, was be-
liind until the last thirty yards, when
he made a good sprint and caught up
with Henderson, the men running neck

this event was 2:03-2.

companiment on the piano by Miss
McDonald. Thru some oversight the
words at the cantata were not print-
cd for the beneﬁt of the audience, and
consequently its meaning was lust
about lost, but nevertheless it made a
good eliect, a large part of the credit
hein'g due to the way in which Miss
McDonald at the piano did as much as
one instrument could in making up
tor the absence or an orchestra.

Miss Seury l’lnys Well.

The Grinncll College oichcstra
played a serenade by Mozart for
strings alone, Hruch‘s violin concert,
with Miss Scary as soloist, two
dances by Colel‘idgerTaylur, and the
iii-st movement or Beethoven's symr
phony in G major. The event or the
evening was Miss Sehl'y’s playing or
the concerto. It is a great saﬁsfac~
tion to hear onc or our students ap-
proach as nearly as she does real arr
tistic stature; the performance or
such a number as this, in its entirety,
with orchestral accompaniment, is a
severe test of all that. the term mu-
sicianship implies, and she met the
test’ with conﬁdence and came on with
a complete measure of success. The
orchestra was at its best in this num-
ber also.

tions in the excellence of the string
section, the increased pl'oﬁctency ot
the wind instruments, and the indica-
tions of a delightful addition in the
harp, played by Mrs. P. J, Ryan. The
orchestra and its director, Professor
Pierce, deserve encouragement, for it
works against many obstacles and it
has many valuable possibilities yet
unrealized. It is lmpl‘oVillg percept-
tibly trout year to year, even this year,
which has been so destructive to our-
musical organizations. The audience
greeted its numbers with enthusiasm,
and would have been glad to hear
more: also the audience would have
been very tolerant it the orchestra
had tahcn a little more time to ap-
proximate accuracy in tuning.

The last. concert will be given to—

night by the thinned College Glee
Club, under whose management the
whole Festival is given. This year
marl-s the Glee club's silver jubilee,
and 1.110 Festival is a. feature of the
celehratloli. The club has arranged
a Splendid Series of programs, and
the large attendance insures a replen—
ishing of the Club's somewhat deplete
cd treasuiy.
