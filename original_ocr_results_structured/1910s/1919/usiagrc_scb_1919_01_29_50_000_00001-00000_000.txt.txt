discharged in time to register for
work iii the second term. Nearly half
of these returning men were commise
sinned, and most of those who were
not were in Officers Training Schools
at diflerent camps. Several of the
men have been overseas, and were
sent back soon after the ending of hos-
tiliti'cs.

Many men from. Lhe flying corps
have reentered school. This branch
seems to have been especially popular
among Grinnell men, both in the army,
navy, nnd marine corps.

Six to ten others have signiﬁed their
intentions of returning this week.

BASKET FIVE lllllli'illlllil

Fast and Furious — Foe Has
Scrappy Team.

SCARLET AND BLACK IS
READY FOR HARD BATTLE

Lineup Is Practically Certain
With Exception of Pivot
Position.

The next garnc ior the scarlet and
black basket ball ﬁvc will be played
next Friday with Cornell at hloiint
Vernon, This contest will be an ini-
portant game from state and Iowa
conference standpoints altbo it has no
bearing on the Missouri Valley Cons
lei-once.

Cornell has a veteran team this year
and has taken some last tennis into
camp. A few wcclis ago the Camp
Dodge tcam was defeated and last
wcck thc Dubuquo seminary- team was
beaten on their own floor. Cornell
has only lost one game, which was. at
the hands of the Coc team Among
the old men back at tho purple and
white institution zirc Kepler, ull»stztie
center last yea' Sanderson, Byerly,
Heodley, and G gsby. The only new
man on the tcaru'is Hurlburt, the for»
mer Marshalltown star, whoiii Grille
hell fans saw in action on the local
floor while he was in high school. This
lineup is a good combination and will
make Crinncll work for the points
which they obtain.

Outlook Brighter.

From what appeared to be a hope—
less mass of m-cen material, "Doc”
Huff is gradually building a real has»
ket ball team. Altho the prospects
were doubtful at first for a winning
team, the outlook brightened when
Viriscl and Crane appeared for praCr
tice. Not many tans thought that the
team would come out ahead in even
one of the games with Nebraska

Linn practically cinched a berth at
the guard position by his brand of
basket ball.ln the two games. in the
second game he allowed Jackson, the
fast Nebraska forward, only one
counter, and kept him on his toes all
during the game. With Winters, a
raugy sophomore, playing the other
defensive position, the guard problem
is well taken care of, Dutch Wells is
not far behind in guarding and may
take onc of the places in case either of
the other two men slackcu the fast
pace which they are new setting.

Center Pusitiilll Indeﬁnite.

The Evans - Hammond combination
appeared to be the best one which
has been used at forward as yet. Both
are shifty and fast and cover the floor
well, besides being dangerous if given
the hall within decent range of the
basket Sauerman and Calesou are
also being used at forward Both have
a good basket eyc altho not able to
cover the floor quite as well as the
other two.

A slight change in the liucup was
made at practice last night when
Crane took Cottys' place at center.
Crane, altho not as tall as Gettys, cov—
crs tlrc tloor in better style. it is not
deﬁnitely known whether he or Ccttys
will hold down the center position.

The team will leave Friday morn-
ing for Mount Vernon. All the men
arc in good condition, except for some
badly skinned knees, which will not
prevent. thorn from starting against
Cornell.

THIRDPIAVEBATILE
BHUUGHTWAHTUEND

Was Greatest. Victory of War and
All Time Says Charles
Upson Clark.

. Charles Unsun Clark of thc

an Academy in Rome, gave a
lecture on “Italy's Part in the War"
illustrated by official Italian war pic—
tures last Saturday night in the
Alumni Hall auditorium, the dist event
on_ the lecture course program.

The great ltalian victory of the
third battle of the Piave ended the
war, said Prof. Clark. by removing
Austria-Hungary from the ﬁeld and
creating an indefensible Bavarian
front. "it is the greatest victory not
merely of this war but of all time. it
was the end of the Austrian Emni e. it
had otulived its usefulness, and this
victory automatically ended the war."

Credit: Is Due Diaz.

Great credit is due the italians and
their leader, General Diaz, for this
victory, Pint. Clark stated. Although
there were 200,000 more Austrians
against him, General Diaz encircled
them in spite of great natural ditfi-
culties and tool: za0,ouo prisoners.

“At ﬁrst there was no intention 01
holding long the line of the Piave.
They sent to the Plave their youngest
troops. These boys fought and died at
the rate ot ten thousand a day for ten
days and they held the riave.

"In June things looked pretty bad.
They had expected to see the Germans
in Paris during July. But that great
victory was the ﬁrst of those stiffen—
ing events that turned the tide.

Shows Moving Pictures.

Pr'of. Clark brought with him three
reels of moving pictures and many
slides taken by the italiau govern—
ment. The moving pictures were very
interesting, especially those scenes of
actual combat and the difficulties ex—
perienced in mountain ﬁghting. Aerial
trams and traveling skis in the mounr
tains dressed in white to escape ob-
servation were interesting features.
The damage caused by air raids and
pictures of Italian aeroplanes were
shown. Road-building and manufac—
turing and industrial scenes were also
exhibited.

The ltaliaris have a rcconstruction
problem, also, he said. They have had
many villages destroyed, but their
modesty has prevented any mention
of the fact. although they need help
and are very grateful for .

"What we do for Italy,” Prof. Clark
concluded, “should he done not out
of sympathy but.out of gratitude."

THOROUGHNESS IS
NEED OF AMERICA

Germany Can Teach Us Thorough-
ness —— Prof. Clark.

l’rof. char-lea Upsori Clark oi the
American Academy in Romc voiced
the hood for great thoroughness in
education in lime ca in chapel Mon—
day.

“We have a great deal to learn
hour the German people in the way of
thoroughness," he said “I remember
reading a series of articles which told
us wc had nothing to learn in the mat.
tor of cilicicncy from Germany. But
the soldier luloivs tlilferontl Ger—
many kept 75% of her effectircs at
the front, while the best We could do
was 25%."

In tho ﬁeld of history and literature
we are behind Europe. “We have the
bcst language in the world and we
ought to talk better," he declared.
