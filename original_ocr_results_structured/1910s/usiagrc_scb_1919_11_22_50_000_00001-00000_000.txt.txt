proves Turkey

approved by the ndnuuistrntion
committee of the faculty Thursday
and will be presented to tho inc-

Tile ooul saving which will be el-

reason tor the committee's recom-
mandation.

With a saving ol'iitty tons of coal,
eiiected during the proposed Thanks
giving recess by turning off the heat
from Wednesday night until Monday
morning, the college coal supply can
he made to last until the Christmas
vacation according to A. E. Ennis, sup-
erintendent ol grounds. A good sup»
,ply should be on hand after the Chris:-
mas recess allowing school Work to
be i'un according to schedule.

If school is held on the Friday lifter
Thanksgiving day as usual, it will be
necessary to keep the buildings heated
for {our days which might be avoided
otherwise and it will probably necessi—
tate calling school a week earlier
ban scheduled before tpe Christmas
vacation.

No Buildings Shut 0:: Yet.

it has not yet been found necessary
to turn of! the heat in any or the
buildings during the day although less
steam than usual is usedsiter the
buildings are once heated up in the
morning. ‘ By the use of this system
the rooms are kept comiortable at all
times and a great saving or iuel is e!»
ected

orders have been placed tor‘the en-

‘re’wlnter supply but it will take
ree‘ weeks after the strike has been
alied oil for the coal to he delivered.
Tor this reason it will be’ expedient to
maek the present supply last until
bristmas to allow the shipments to
e made during the vacation.
