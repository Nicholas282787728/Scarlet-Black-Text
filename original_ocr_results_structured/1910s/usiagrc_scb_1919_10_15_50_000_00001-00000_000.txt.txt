CLIFFORD DEVEREUX AND
ZINITA GRAF IN LEADS

Famous Comedies Well Received
By Large Grinnell
Audiences.

Three appearances of the Clifford
Devereux Players in Crlnnell Monday
and Tuesday left the audience feeling
with Kipling when he said
liked them all.” For there was no one
particular drama of the three that
were presented here, which could be
called better than another.

“School For Scandal“ Opener.

The opening performance, Richard
Brinsley Sheridan’s “School For Scan-
dal", carrying with it a reputation as
one 01‘ the greatest of English dramas,
was perhaps the most difficult to pre-
sent to an English audience. Like
Hamlet, the ditliculty of technique is
almost lnsuperable. And as great
actors play the Shakespearean trag~
edy, the Dcvereux. Players succeeded
with Sheridan's comedy.

The play is essentially a comedy of
manners. But through the skill of
the actors, the ouaintly digniﬁed re
straint of the period in which the play
was written was emphasized over the
mere comedy of the situations This
was especially noticeable in the de-
lightful minuet at the end of the ﬁrst
act. Credit is due to the Devereux
actors for the
which they reproduced the diction of
play which is noted for the most beau-
tiful language in drama,

if criticism is to be made, it can he
said that the audience missed the pe—
tite, vivaciousness desired in thc char
acter of Maria The character of sir
Oliver Surface, too, was different from
the common ideal of that person.

Emphasis on New Characters.

People who have read this play were
given a new treat by the manner in
which Clifford Devereux and Miss
Zinitn Graf so cleverly placed the em-
phasis of the play on new characters.
Sir Peter Teazle and his wife. And
although this treatment robbed the
parts ot Maria and Charles of some of
their importance, it is perhaps justir
ﬂed by the added interest in the other
characters.

The impossibility of perfectly trans-
lating Edmond Rostaud’s "Romancers"
and the natural difficulty of acting a
play written in verse only served to
increase the credit due the actors for
their work in the Tuesday matinee. In
several places it was noticed that the
form of this poetic drama attracted the
attention of the audience away from
the presenmtion. The additional skill
necessary to counteract this tendency
would have hampered less able play-
ers.

Musical Effects Dellahw.

For pure beauty of text this pretty,
little play is undoubtedly among the
best in the field of drama. Musicians
were especially delighted with the
mastery with which the themes of the
incidental music were related to the
different characters. The accuracy
and delicacy with which this music
accompanied each character was so—
perb.

George Bernard Shaw's ”Arms and
the Man" has been the subject of vol—

NEW REFERENCE
DESK INADEQUATE

Reference Department Still Too
Small Despite Enlargement,

With more than one thousand hooks
on the reserve shelves of the college
library, the problems of shelf space
for the reserved books again becomes
serious.

This fall, owing to the congestion
ot the upper reading room shelves
ifor reserved books, the college arrang-
ed for the construction of a larger
rcscrve desk on the lower floor. This
was thought at the time to be suf-
ficient lo care for the growth for sev-
eral years.

Tire increase ot instructors in the
English departments and the return
,of the college to pre-war eurollinent
has made the number of reserve books
larger than was expected.

The English department, easily
ﬁrst in the number of books upon
reserve. The Political Science and
Economics departments are second
with history a poor third. From 1,050
to 1100 books are constantly on reserve
for students taking work in these den
pertinents.

‘FROSH [iRiO ELEVEN
TO SOWE OAMES

Have One of the Best Prep‘Elevens
In State — Give Varsity
Much Competition,

Gl'imlell’s freshman football team
lboasts of a galaxy of individual stars
rrvalled by but few teams in the state
and the preps are furnishing the var-
city with stiff competiiton every night.
li-eady they have a record of having
.scored on their older adversaries, and
next year should see a number of the
lFl'osh team added to the varsity.
! Coach Barrett, captain of the 1915
[Gl'innell varsity, who is coaching the
‘preps this year, says that the one lly
in the ointment is the small squad re-
porting for practice and the seeming
lack of spirit among the majority of
Frosb men. One or two games are in
process of arrangement, but unless
more men report for practice with
some degree of regularity these will
be abandoned,

 

i Hope To Scllellulc Games.
> Coach Barrett hopes to be able to
schedule a game with the Drake fresh-
‘lllen team, or with some other lowa
college prep squad. Drake is known
'to have one of the strongest freshmen

earns in its history, and should tut»
, ish the Grinnell yearlings with cone
elder-able competition. Two years age
‘the 1921 Freshmen gave Shattuck a
good drubbing, and it is rumored that
shattu'ck would like a return game.
Last year freshmen were played on the
‘varsity eleven.
The yearlings have a fast backﬁeld
,in Ristihe, a balfback- Hoyt, brother
;of "Dad" and "Chuck’ Fearing, a for-
mer allrslate man trorn Fort Dodge,
who captains'thc Fresh and is being
used at full, and Packer of Sioux City,
a former Culver quarterback. Whiter
hill of Marshalltown, is also being
alternated at half, as are several oth-
ers. _

Hare Speedy Line.

The line represents both beef and
speed with “Abe” Webster of Eldora,
Datesman or Council Bluffs, and Tem-
ple of Champaign, lll, cnds; Barlow
and Tillotsen, guards; Williams of
,Grinuell High and Fl'oning of Hamp-
‘ton, tackles; and Kearney of Grinnell,
center. These men arc by no means
a permanent combination, and are re-
inforced by Bauman, Heinrichs, Dixon
and several others. ,The chief diffi-
culty iii picking a ﬁrst eleven is the
i ~egularity with which the men re-
port tor practice. Coach Barrett is
‘giving his men as much work as pos-
sible so that they can step into vacant
places on the varsity next fall.

Students Want China
To Retain Shantung

"The student class in China has
made itself a political power which
must be reckoned With," said Carl
Compton in ii recent intervij con-
cerning the two years of war relief
and Y. M. C. A. which Lie experienced
in RuSSle. and the Near-East

On the return trip last summer Ml‘.
Compton l'nftchetl Pekin in the midst
of the bloodless revolution success»
fully carried on by the students of
China, It had far its object the pol-
itical and commercial independence of
China from Japan.

The attitude of the peace conierenee
in granting Shantul‘lg to Japan has
CDllvinCed the sLudent leaders that in
her need China can expect no help
from outside. They have therefore
taken up the problem of maintaining
the Dollar of the Chinese nation them—
selves,

Want Boycott of Japan.

The speciﬁc pul‘pnse which the rev—
olution sought to accomplish were
(1) the resignation of 09113“) high
government officials who were accuse
ed of entering into tlcttlillgs with Japan
to the detriment of China, and (2) the
boycott of Japanese goods and sub»
sﬁtuliun of Chinese made goods.

Mr. Col‘nptcn sketched the methods
which the students took in carrying
on the revolution. Bands of students
went out through the cities and couu-
my districts stirring the people to
action along the lines indicated, The
girls of the schools and colleges help—
ed by making hats and laces as sub
stitutes for the Japanese articles
which had been used before. In some
cases piles of conﬁscated Japanese
goods served for bonﬁres.

Convince Merchants.

Merchants who handled Japanese
merchandise were interviewed and the
reasons why he should abandon his
Japanese patronage were pointed olIL
to him. Finally the merchants of
Pekin were so thul’oughly Won Ovcl‘
that they agreed to close their shops
and keep them closed until UH) gov-
ernment agreed to the concessions
which the l‘evollltionlsts demanded.

“Many of the students were put in
yrison,” said Mr. Compton, “ but imr
mediutely many others came to ask
ta be imprisoned also."

Through the Gi'inucllrinrchina move
the secretary points out, the revolu-
tion \VELS related tu Gl‘illllell in ft
vital way. At Tecllou where Gl'rnnell

supports a boys' and a girls' school,
students of both institutions took an
active part. The boys went out on
speaking tours through the country
and the girls engaged themselves in
making hats.

Mr. Compton further explained that
the question of Japanese influence was
of particular importance to Techou as
it is situated in the Shantung province.

"The students are a factor in Chi-
nese political life," said Compton.
“Through the school which Gl'ilinell
supports in China, which, by the way,
embodies a bit of the transplanted
Crinnell Spirit, the college her-e is
helping in a material way to shape thc
destinies of this great nation.”

Compton ill Y. M. C. A. Work.

Starting in the summer of 1917 Mr.
Compton put in two years of relief
and y. M. C. to. work in Russia and
in the Near East Going ﬁrst in the
interests of the relief comnrittcc for
work in the Near East he made his
headquarters at Alexandrople. The ad-
vance of the Turks forced his retire
into Russia where be located at Sam-
ara.

Upon his ar ival at Samara the nor»
shcvists were in control. Relief work
was car-red on in conjunction with
them. Mr. Compton was in the city
at the time of its capture by the Czechs
They also co-operated with the rim.
ericans in relief work and granted
them a private car to use in their
work.

Retugees, ﬂeeing from the advancing
Turks would congregate in hundreds
and thousands at points in southern
Russia where there was no food. it
was Mr. Comptons’ business to locate
centers in the interior where there
was enough food to care for these
refugee bands. In this work he trave
eled 30,000 miles.

Locales in Omsk

For more than a year the interior
country where he was located was
absolutely cut off from outside news.
\thu means of communication were
again opened and the Red Cross was
able to come in and take charge of
the reliet work Mr, Compton was
transferred to the position of Y. M.
C. a. secretary. He was located at
Omsk and was general Y. M. c. n.
secretary for this place.

“Through the kindness 0! Professor

by prominent clergyman and business

they marched in to the strains of the
"War March of the Priests", from

with his megaphone and called for

was especially pleased and touched by

probably the ﬁrst time in many a long

SCARLET AND BLACK
FALLS BEFORE HEAVY

AMESEgiEOATION

Iowa. Aggies Score Touchdown in
First Few Minutes of the
Game.

LACK OF PRACTICE GAME
RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFEAT

Macy, Minty, Parker- and Schultz
All Star in Backﬁeld
Positions.

On an ideal day with an ideal held
before a crowd of 4,000 people, aim
eluding a Grinnell tollowing of several
hundred, the light ci-riiiiell team went
down in defeat last Saturday before
the heavier and more experienced
'Aines team by the score of 7 to 0.
Ames scored all her points in the
ﬁrst period of the game, before the
Scarlet and Black aggregation could
collect herself, but alter that Grinnell
outplayed the Aggies. This was the
ﬁrst game tor Grinnell in the Missouri
Valley Conference as well as the initial
game of the season.

Coach Tollefson is to be congratulat-
ed upon the showing of his
men, Davis, the star for the
riggres, was the big factor in bringing
the ball before the Scarlet and Black
goal posts in the ﬁrst quarter. He
made the longest individual gain of
the game in this period running for
thil-tyel‘lve yards on a sweeping and
play before ire was downed on Grille
,nell’s ten yard line. Captain Den-
lﬁeld was drawn back from tackle and
plunged through for the touchdown,
Davis kicked goal. ,

Blarlllcy Phrys stellar Game at End.
The outstanding feature of the game
was the remarkable playing of Mark—
ley at left end. Although be weighed
but 151 pounds, he was in every play
around his end and only once did the
Aggies go around him lor an apprecia-
hle gain. Sport critics at the game
predicted that should his stellar play”
ing continue he should make the myth-
ical Missouri Valley cleyen. Winter
and McLai-en at tackles and Whitnier
at center also played creditahly. it
is diificult to pick a star from the
backfield as they all played a brand
or football that should class them as
(the bcst rounded out quartet in the
state.

Barker, Deniield and Davis stood out
above all the Allies player-s, although
the Ames team ran with more mach" e
ilike precision than Crinncll. Vander—
loo outpuiited Schultz and Macy twen-
ty yards, but Schultz was handicapped
.by an iiiju in his side. The/limes
team should prove to be a formidable
contender n the Missouri valley this
year, Next Saturday they lock horns
with Missouri which team battled a
c to 6 tie with the Kansas Ag‘gies last
Saturday, This gam‘e is being closely
watched as it will have much bearing
on picking the winner of the valley
this year. ‘
