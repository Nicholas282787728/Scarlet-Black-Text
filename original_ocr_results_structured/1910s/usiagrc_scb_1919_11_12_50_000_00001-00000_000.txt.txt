the Pioneers defeated their ancient
rival, Coe college, on Ward Field, last
Saturday by a s to 0 count.

For the first time this season, the
breaks of the game favored the Plus

opponents by a series of end runs and
forward passes, and remained on the
offensive thruout the whole game
with the exception of a few minutes
in the third quarter. Coe displayed

to straight football, and relied on line
bucks and end runs for ground gains.

The importance of keeping up the
powers of resistance in the prevention
of influenza was emphasized by Dr
0. F. Parish in Chapel Monday morn-
ing.

That one has had the flu is not an

take it again, according to Dr. Parish.
He warned against common colds, parr
ticularly. Isolation and disinfection
Should be used to prevent the spread
of the disease.

ELEGT J. F. DEEMS TL]
HEART] OF TRUSTEES

Was State Food Controller During
War—Possible Candidate
For Governor.

WAS ELECTED AT ANNUAL
BANQUET IN DES MOINES

J. F. Deems of Burlington. is the
new member of the hoard of trustees.
He was elected at a meeting of the
board of Des Moines last Friday, and
immediately accepted the appointment.
He was one of the speakers at the an-
nual alumni banquet held in Des
Moines Friday night at Hotel Savory.

Mr. Dcems was for many years one
of the managers of the New York Cen—
tral lines, and has also been connected
with the Burlington lines. During the
war he was state food administrator.
and has been recently spoken of as
a likely candidate for the Republican
nomination for governor. Since his re-
tiremeut from active business he has
been interested in iowa politics.

In his speech in Des Moines Friday
in behalf of the endowment campaign,
he declared himself strongly in favor
of a liberal arts ‘eduCation'as a basis
of future work. In his position with
tho New York Central he had oppor—
tunity to observe many men. both with
college education and without, and al—
though he said that thc man with arm-
bition and willingness to work usually
was the man who won out, the man
with the college education was the man
who won the big iobs. Mr. Deems has
given much thought to the problem
of public education and thinks the op—
portunity should be given every child
to get a high school education.

All hopes for 2t game between the
Cornell Preps and the Gl'innt‘ll years
llngs vanished into thin ail‘ yestelu
(lily when Coach Ii. J. Huff received
a. letter from Coach Finger of Cornell
stating that the athletic Committee of
that institution were unwilling to 3.17
low their first-year Squad to make the
trip. The letter explained that the
Cornell Fl’DSll are (llvitlcd into two
separate squads and taught altogether
different signals, which would make
it difficult to get one whole squad to-
gcther in time for the Cornell game
here on Nov. 22, hence the committee's
refusal of his request.
