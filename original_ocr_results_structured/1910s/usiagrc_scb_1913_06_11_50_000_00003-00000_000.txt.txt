were picked from the stars who have

of llorscrllluy' dlltl the l'eneudl of Knuth
on the part oi returning sons at old
Grihucll. Many tnlcs went the rounds
about the playing that Bennett was
capable or on The first o-ganized
team that Gritrnell had," about the
lowa grime that was lost by an unex-
pected long throw from center ﬁeld;
and about 't‘tirk's more recent ex'ploits
in the region ot‘ second base,

The game was limited to seven in
nings and was featured by good humor,
horse-play, double-plays and even
throw , Jar-tun proved handy with the
hat, ' ‘urk" was almost his old seli
in a new position, and "Jollllm" Noll‘s

nable Men in the Field
and at Eat.

The err..treir .aseball team or 1912
went through a season that was 1.
unique one in many respects. At times,
the team showed dashes oi baseball
ability such as is seldom tound in a.
college team, but just when the team
seemed to have strnch its stride, it
always encountered a stumbling-block,
and relapsed into another prolonged
session or medioc ,. some of the
players played consistently iveu
throughout the season, but the team as
e u hole seemed to laelr the element at
stoatlines. that counts ior so much in
any extended series oi games.

The first tiiree games or the season
were played while the tearir was “on
the road”7the player sojourning at
Cedar Rapids between gaures. an
three games were lost, the ﬁrst to Care
nell by a close score, and the others
to Coe anti Leander Clark by scores
that were anything but elose. Ander—

.son developed it lame arm after the

ﬁrst game 01 the series, and was bracki-
Cally useless in the Other L\\'o touteslﬁ.
as the scores would indicate.
