Sensational Basket Shooting of

TEAMS EVENLY MATCHED
IN SPEED AND TEAM WORK

Field Basket in Last Minute of
Play Smother: Grinnell's
Hope of Victory

A tree throw made by Aldrich in the
last halt minute of play garc Ames a
24723 victory over the Grinnell ﬁve in
a game which was tull ol thrilling
plays trom beginning to end.

The ﬁrst part or the game was the
most spectacular and the 15-15 score
at the end ot the ﬁrst halt marked the
best exhibition ot ohcnoive team play
on the part of both Learns that has
been seen on the local ﬂoor this sea—
son. The visitors started working
their scoring machine early, but the
Grlllncll ﬁve were not long in follow-
ing them, and the gamc from then on
hung in the balance.

SEIH'P on Long Shots

Most of the points made in the ﬁrst
half were the results at long shots at
the basket which went tin-n the net—
ting wlth monotonous regularity. In
this rcspcct Aldrich tor Amos and
Soiners tor the local school were the
main (actors. Aldrich. however, kept
his team in the lead in this hair by
making tliiee inorc tree throws than
Hammond,

In the ﬁrst hair of the game the
lguftl’ding on both sides stiltenctl ant]
, leld goals were few and far between.
Thc locals tried hard to orciconic the
load which Allies had gained in the
ﬁrst halt and tor a while it lookcd as
it they would be successful, tor Gar-
Iler tlirciv a ﬁeld a goal which ticd tlic
scorc. Aldrich put an end to all or
Grinnclrs chances at this stage or the
gamc Willi a tree throw, and the time
was too short lor the hard righting
Grinncll quintet to regain the lead.

huh-s shows Teamwork

Aldrich and Boyd shared the honors
tor Aincs by their speed and baskets
shooting. The Amos team work was
ll) up entirely around the two [0
