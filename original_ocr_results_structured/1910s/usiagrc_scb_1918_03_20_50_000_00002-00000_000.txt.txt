TRIVIALITIES
Grlnnell college should havc one sue
preme purpose at the present time.
That purpose is to Help Will the War.
Evtery other aim should be secondary
to'this. It Grillnell is to justiiy her
‘ exrsteuce, she must do all in her power
to hclp the government in this crisis.

in order to do‘its best. the college
has endearored to maintain as near
its normal life as possible, The gov-
ernment has speciﬁcally requested
that the colleges of the country go
about their usual work, putting more
cmphas , however, on the activities
which trill directly aid in the winning
of the war. ‘

if we are to maintain anything like
a normal life here, we should aim at
the best and highest in that life. Our
scholastic liie should be more serious
than ever hetor-e, our military and Red
Cross work should be carried on sftir
cicntly, and our student life in general
should be attractive as well as simple.

l-lard time parties, kid parties, and
the like, however, are no more condu-
cive to a sane Win the War; spirit
than parties and social attairs which
are better suited to the lite or a great
college.

The Scarlet and Black does not her
lreve that social aifairs are overwhelme
'rngly important, and has not argued
ior an increasc in the prominence or
social attair in Gl'lunell. We do he
lievc nrrnly, howeycr, that the wrong
k d oi social life here has a perni-
c us clfcct on the college, and will do
more to harm the war work or the colv
lcgc than a sane and intelligent social
life.

It we are to have any social liie here
at all during war times, we believe it

should be 2 kind of social lite that is]

Pill BETA KAPPA HONORS

A reward that is given for serious
purpose and hard work seldom tails
to meet with universal approval. The
two men and two women who were
given Phi Beta Kappa certiﬁcates this
morning receive the hearty congl'atllr
lations oi all Grinncll, The honor-
comes to them because of consistent
cln, room etfort ior tlrrcc years, and
thc mere fact that the orinnell chapter-
con dcrcd those men and women as
dcser ng of mélilllel-ship in the na—
tional society oi scholar s sufficient
indication that their work was or high

Schola ,-hip, or course, is not evel‘yr
thing in collcgc, and the iact that these

honor all the greater.

divided into (Lime terms or twelve
weeks each, instead of into two semes-
ters of eighteen weeks, is gaining in
popularity among the collcgcs and uni.
versitres ot the Unitcd states, and it
has been urged recently that Grinneli
adopt the system. ’

As a war tinrc measure, particularly,
it is dcscrying ot scriotrs consideration.

The plan in detail is this: The ﬁrst
term \lmlld end at the time of the
Christmas vacation, thc second term
would continue irorn tho ﬁrst of Janu—
ary tin the spring vacation, and the
third t would begin in April and
cud before the middle oi June, it
wotild mean that the vacations would
ciosc the terms, rather than inter-rune
ing the work of the college hy dividing
the semester, as is now the case, It
would also mean the eliminntion, at
least to a great extent, of twosllollr
courses, and the substitution of three—
horrr one—term courses in their places.
A ﬁverholll' course for one term, silltlr
larly, would do about the same work
as a thl'ccrhollr onc-semcster course
does now.

From a wa ork standpoint, the
chief advantage of the change would
he the ease in which a man could drop
his work the ﬁrst or April to go on a
farm; or enter college the ﬁrst of Jane
nary if he wanted to work in the fall,
The college could more easily adapt
itself to the life of the world outside.

Equally important are numerous
other advantages to the students in
general.

Two-hour courses are generally more
or loss unsatisfactory. The great gap
hetwcen a Thursday class and a class
the following Trresday interrupts the
work of the course most seriously.
lThrecahour ccurscs are open to some-
.what the same objection, to a. lesser-
degree. other things being equal, a
man is apt to dcrive more benefit from
intensive work in three hvehonr
courses in dinerent ﬁelds for one sc-
nicstcr, than' irorn threc twoehcnr
courses and three threehour courses
tor a semester.

The same amount and same variety
of work could be taken in a_ college
course under the new plan. A man
worrld do intensive work in a subject
tor onc term, rather than taking a sea
mester or year to do it with fervor
classes each week.

The way in which the vacations end
the work or the terms, rather than
interrupting the work of thc semess
ters is also a decided,advantagc oi
the three-term plan. The last of the
ﬁrst semestcr is now an unsatisfactory
period. A student returns from his
Christmas vacation with 1rather hazy
ideas regarding the work pursued in
November and December. He then
either must attempt to cram tor the
coming “ﬁnals," or give up the job as
hopeless, and wait ‘with patience tor
the start 0[ a new semester to "hcgin

 

over" with a number of "cans” and
“E's" from the ﬁrst serncstcr.

A reorganization of the cl‘etlitrllolll‘
system would be necessary under the
new plan, but that is a dctail which
has been worked out at colleges using
the term plan, and which could be
modiﬁed to suit Grinncll conditions
without great (lilficulty

BALLOON TEAHS UP ATIJWN

Former Student Tells of Work in
Balloon School

How the night oi an Anrcric i an
scr-vation haloon almost liter-ally ‘Lol‘e
up" a southern town, is told in a letter-
from Lient. s. R. Kirkpatrick, a iorrner
Grinncli student, who is now attending
the balloon school at Ft. ,Sill, Okla
Extracts from the letter iollow:

“In a night night, when the crew
was trying to make an easy landing
the drag guide, a heavy rope ado ioet
long. got caught around a telephone
pole and wrecked the telephone sys
tem of Pendleton, Texas.

"After all this devastation, the crew
was greeted with opcn arms. The tcl-
cphone men wouldn’t. acccpt any dam-
agcs and neither would anyone elsc
whose property had been damaged. In
tact, patriotism is almost a disease
with those people."
