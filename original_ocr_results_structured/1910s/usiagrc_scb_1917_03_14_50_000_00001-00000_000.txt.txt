If the drama of the future is going

Never has a Grinuell audience been
so interested, never so amazed, never

and ﬁnally never have people sat back

did at the appearance of the Pol'tlnan-

Removed Barriers.

At the Quadrangle Monday after-
noon Stewart Walker said that he had
removed tootlights, had dispensed with
an orchestraiall, because he did not
Want any barrier to intervene between
his actors and his audience. And one
only needs to point to the spontaneity
of acting to prove that Walker's idea
is a.‘ wonderfully successful one, for

ol these was “one oi Lord Dunsany’s

“Six Who Pass While the Lentils

with rich and interesting philosophy.
Gregory Kelley as the Boy took the
leading part in this, although credit

Particularly was Nancy Winston’s ol-
fort worthy of praise. She played the
part of a Girl with more real feeling,
more spontaneity and more genuine

TimHMeltclmm Scores Three
GoulsArFreslmuln Guards
Show Strength.

For the second time in their college
career the 1917 class got away with
the class basketball championship last
Saturday night, when they detected the
last Freshman team 1579. The game
was a play-oft oi the tie which had rce
sulted from the series played just be-
fore the start of the regular season,

The dclense of the Senior guards
and Meacham‘s ability to locate the
basket spelled delcat tor the Year-
lings. They only made two field goals
in the entire game, both of them com-
ing irom Garner. At that, they were
in the lead at hall time by a count of
5 to 4. for "Pat" Hammond had been
hitting the basket with great regular-
ity on his chances from the foul line.

The second hall belonged entirely
to the Seniors. Macy, who was substi-
tuted at the start or the period, started
the tallying with a basket shortly af-
ter play commenced. Meacham in
creased the lead with another ringer.
and later in the game he evaded De
Ruyter long enough to drop in two
more. Garner's second basket and
two louls thrown by Hammond were
all the points the Freshmen could acL
cumulatc.

The work of the Freshman guards
was air ight, for only one basket was
secured off them. Garner and Home
mond worked Well together as usual.
and" they made all the points for their
team.

I The ilnel game of the tournament
was played Saturday night between
Marshalltown and West Liheity, the
Iormer winning 114;. West Liberty
held a one point lead at the end of _
the iii-st halt, but the Marshalltown
guards put on the screws in the sec—
‘ond round and held their opponents, to
one basket while their teammates
garnered in eight points.
j, The Marshalltown five displayed all
.around ability in their last appear—
ance. Dixon, Hurlburt and Balch all
punctured the ring at least once, and
Dixnll also added some nice foul
throwing. J. Smith as usual guarded
in splendid style, but was hampered
somewhat by a damaged optic received
earlier in the tournament. Wattel's
and Gibson were the only ones of the
West Liberty team to count points.
Gibson’s two baskets were especially
neat.

Due to an unfortunate pairing, Mar—

exciting game or the series took place
Saturday aitcrnoon instead or that
night Marshalltown owed the slender‘
mar in of her 1240 victory to a one
point lead at the end or each half. The
game was a battle royal, and the fouls
were rather numerous.

Hurlburt slipped in two much»need<
ed baskets in the second act, and Dix-
on and H. smith were responsible lor
the remainder of the points. Dixon
threw his only tries from the foul line.
