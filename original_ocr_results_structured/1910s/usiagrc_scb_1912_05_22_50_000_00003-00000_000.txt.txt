MISS WOODWORTH PLE‘ASES

Senior Recital Is Much Enjoyed
by Good Audience.

Last Saturday evening Mabcl “'oods
north, or the class or 1912, gave her
graduation piano recital in Herrick
Chapel, The chapel was well ﬁlled and
the auditors gave every indication or
being well pleased with Miss Wood
ii'ol'th's rendition of the brilliant Bros
gram. The ﬁrst number, Beethoven
Sonata, 0p. 14, No. 2, made heavy de»
niaiids both as to technique and as to
interpretation, but the performer was
easily equal to them. she was able to
get good contrasts tlirnoiit the pro
grain—2t tliing nliich not all woman
pianists can do. L 's Liebestrnume
was probably the favorite nith the our
dience, both because or its intrinsic
beauti‘ and because it was more famil-
iar. The last number, Mozart's Cone
cei-lo in D minor, was accompanied hi
the College Orchcstra, and was a good
example or a lorin or music which is
not oiten heard in student: recitals.
The second movement, Roiuanza, was
espEcially beautiful.
