Senior Voice Recital Saiui‘tlayi
Review of Miss Konopnsek’s
Work Here.

res lirirton' song re trrl,
given iii the chapel, Saturday evcning.
.uar 2i, was or unusual excellence. We
have heard it _s Burton marrv times he
tore and have alvvars adinir-cd Iici- cures
lIIl work, but never bolore Saturday
evening did she dismay so untiucstioir
ablv the ﬁnisher] technique and the
Iieautrtul tone-duality ot' uliicli she
is the proud possessor.

Her program was composed oi car-c-
t‘uIIy selected numbers id gave good
oupportnnity ior- coloratura, dramatic,
legato, and piani imo singing 1n the
'Voioes at Spring" by Strauss, her
voice had 'a ﬂute lie roundiic s, sweet-
n ss, and nesibilitv In the ‘Comlelid
u'a er" h Deiibes, and in the two
songs by u- cg. she had tlic delicacy
and sustained soilness which tonic
uni) train the most car-ot'ul training.
Her singing oi “Eisit's Dreuiu" l‘roin
Loiiengrin was a iarnnrltahle piece or
work for a young student.

The Conservatory has never boiorc
produced such singing as we have
heard this spring in the student senior-
rccitais, The choice or pure music ior
program use, and the- wide range or
choice. the ﬁne technique displayed
by the singers, all prove the surcness
and thoroughness of their trainingi
all point with praise to the teacher-
who i. been developing the art or
singir in Gviiiiiell. .u' Konoiraselt
has hccn with us tour ion and her
inﬂuence has been tell. in an "Kaninrer
niusrh" ulviLli we have heard. There
has been a noticeable iurprovemr t in
the hind ot nu ,ic sung and cirior i by
the students; this tomes directly trom

tor "masloliill singing," a demand

nell. Her studio has Iicconre the (outer
or a. large and enthusiastic tircle or
students. and liEl' word in matters or
interprcttioir and taste has attained
nuthoiiiv. With .\liss Konopasek in
rhaigcot‘ tho llcpaitmcnt ot' Votul

to bceoiiie famous l‘or its singers, Now
