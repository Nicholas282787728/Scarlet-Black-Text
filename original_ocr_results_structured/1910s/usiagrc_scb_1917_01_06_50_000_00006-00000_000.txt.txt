theory of deposits of glacial di-iits
which he expounded in Blair hall last
night.

Professor Kay, who besides being
head of the geology department of the
State University fills the position oi
state geologist, addressed an audience
which \vcll filled they Chemistry lec-
ture room, on the subject, “The Glacial
Period in Iowa.”

"inwa," declared the speaker,’ “is
classic ground in the study or geologie

surface is such that each drift or layer
deposited is clearly revealed in dif~
[erent portions of the state." He then
traced the history of the theory of
glacial deposit from its first sugges—

stage revealed by latest research, a

fairyland of some fifty thousand years
ago, Plofcssnr Kay explained, "Dur-

iing the inter-glacial period following

the deposit of the tirst drift, lowa was
inhabited by a vast amount of animal
life, none or whose forms have been
preserved to the present.”

He then showed the audience some
photos of reconstructed skeletons of
elk, bear, hisnn, goat, elephants of (life
fcrent types, the giant sloth, the
mighty mammoth, great hairy maste-
dons, and a large number of other spe-
cies which are now totally extinct.
“Tllel'e existed at this time," the
geologist continued, “a little horse, fai-
fleeter than any of the present, and
which would have been a delight to

the race track enthusiast of today.”

Theories will Clluugd.

"The glacial history of Iowa," con-
cluded the speaker, "is just beginning
to be revealed. Ten years from now
our theories will have greatly chang—
ed. There are vast. problems yet to be
SOIVELI by the younger students of gee
oluglcal research,"

The lecture was greatly strengthen—
ed by the use of stereootlcon slides,
most of which were photographs tak-
Cn by Professor Katy himself, or Charts
made under his di ction.
