Cost Cutting

Price Cutting.

ONCE IN A WHILE SOME ONE
COMES ACROSS WITH A REAL
IDEA lil cost cutting that is too
big to keep for his owil benefit or
his employers’, or his stockholders.‘
And the idea trickles out in the
shape or a REAL SAVING to the

consumer.

IT WAS SUCH AN IDEA THAT
RESULTED IN

idea that linings iii over-coats could

easily be dispensed with, greatly decreasing their liiarlirraeturing cost

and greatly increasing their scrriceaiiiliiy.
