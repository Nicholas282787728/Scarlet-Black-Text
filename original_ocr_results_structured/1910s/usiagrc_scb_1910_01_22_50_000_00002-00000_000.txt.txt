The semester reviews will come the
last of next week. Preparation now
will make the four days much more
comfortable.

By defeating Missouri Griiiiiell has
again demonstrated their fitness for
membership in the Missouri Valley
Conference. Missouri and Kansas are
conceded to be the favorites for the
first honors in that organization.

No more practical talk has been
made on the chapel platform this year
than that made yesterday by Professor
Canard. There is probably nothing
that students are asked to do more
than to study, yet the constant prompt-
ing is accompanied with little or no
suggestion of how to proceed. Because
of the importance or the suggestion,
we have given considerable space to a
review of the essential points of the
talk.

A referendum vote oi the students
has been suggested as one means of
settling some or the disturbing ques-
tions relating to Grinncll life. Some,
plan where each year in college could
be made to count in such a vote, where
for instance each Freshman vote would
count 1, each Sophomore vote ‘2, Junior
3, and Senior 4, in the total siimmiiiz
up, might serve as a satisfactory dilrlr
sion of influence, at the same time be
big thoroly democratic in deciding
questions of importance by the stir
dents.

"The Lewis Literary Societi- do

high standard. A good team was rhosr
an and ll. may he expected to make a
strong shouing against the Iowa Wes
leyan academy. rue society is larger
this year than formerly, and shows
much iniprovcraentin the quality of
work. The boys are gctting'trainiug
there which will be of value to the
college in the coming years,"

“Yes, we are getting along very well
with the subscription canvas," said
Paul MacEacbron, business manager
01 the Junior Annual, one day this
week. “The work is also proceeding
quite well in other lines and we hope
to be able to present a. book which will
compare favorably with those of pre
Vlolls years. One leature oil this Catlr
yes that is especially gratifying is the
number of alumni who are subscrilr
ers. The number from the class of
1909 is very large."
