The Lancaster Overcoat:

If you are familiar with the points of (inference be
tween hand and machine tailoring, you will appreci-
ate these overeoats when you see them.

The collars are “hand felled” and ”hand drawnH
—not "turned” by machine, like the large collars of
most overcoats. The sleeves close with adjustable
strap and four buttons. They have knit“wind shields"
whieh fit close arcund the wrists, to prevent wind or
snow from blowing in. They are all wool, and will

not shrink
The buttons are imported horn.

Above all, the hand tailoring and style will satis-
fy you in every dctai .
