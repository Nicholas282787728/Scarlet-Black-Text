noble family of Great Russia.

From her earliest years, she was im-
pressed by the contrast of living, con-
ditions between her father's serfs and
that of her own family.

At the age of 25 years she married
o young nobleman of liberal tenderly

eics, but who was not prepared as she ,

was to make great personal sacriﬁces
tor the cause, The longer Mme.
Breshkovsky studied the problem, the
more she became convinced that an-
tucracy must be over-thrown it the sut-
faring peasantry were to be relieved.
She did'not quail at the knowledge oi
the inevitable results which would tol-
law an open profession or her beliefs,
She consequently became an active
agitator against the Russian political
system. '
Imprisoned For Two Years.

She was soon apprehended and was
held in prison ful‘ two,ycars awaiting
"rial and then given a sentence of live
years‘ service in the mines. She was
the ﬁrst Woman to be sentenced to
service in the mines.

After serving her term, she returned
from Sibe ‘a. and immediately set
about organ .ng once more disguised
as a peasant. She continued this air
til, in 1904, she visited the United
Ststcs to enlist ﬁnancial aid tor the
csuse.

Returning to her country she was
arrested and kept in Solitary Cullﬁnc-
merit for .1 year and then shipped once
nioreto Siberia. There she remained
for eight yezlrs, until, in 1917, the gov
ernment ot the Czar w’es overthrown
and Slic was Set free.
