The class series her-etotore has not

Freshmen a decided zldliultilge over the

lowering the general qualrtv or the

it has tailed utterly to arouse the in.

The present system uill raise the
quality or play, and the addition or the
’Varsity men will give the three upper
classes a chance against the Freshmen,
all ot which will contribute to the iii-I

The 'Var-sit squad will soon be cut

operates against the sut'cess or the

An evening with the cartoonists, was
the clever idea on ' d out at the inn»,

Pul'lors had been transiorrncd into a
cosy living roorit, with a ceiling or‘
white crepe paper strips, and walls or
heavy dark green paper. A. honor tor
the orchestra had been tasbioned in
the north end ot the G31“, and on the
nest srde a gas log named in a paper-
ﬁreplace. Library tables, strewn with.
torrric supplements, and iraring strrdv
lamps, were placed about the r-oor.r.
and with rugs. roclting chairs and
gracelul vases ot tall red carnatiorrs,
the huge room loolietl very homeliltc.

Happy Hooligan. Sherlock liolrncs
Jr., Jcit and nutt, and a number- oi.
other prime r'avoi-ites t'urnishcd the
entertainment. A stage near the
doors at the south end, was revealed
and on it the characters trout the
“colllics” prescntcd their series ot pic.
tut-es. Tire acts were planned to lol-
low very closely the div sions given in
the papers, and perhaps the most on.
joyetl was the “art" where Jail and
Mutt demonstrated “gravity.”

Half a dozen high school girls, in
ruaids' costumes, ’w h Ilinrix dr
and ﬁlmy white aprons and traps, scri ed
the cream and cake, and earlier in the‘
evening presided at the trappe tables.
