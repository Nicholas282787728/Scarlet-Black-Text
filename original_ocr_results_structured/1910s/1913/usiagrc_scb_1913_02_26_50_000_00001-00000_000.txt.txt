Crowd Present.

While the girls were engaged in in
mg hit as our t-oloniol ant'estl‘y Sat.
urday night, the college nirn pulled ol‘l
an art at their own in the Men's
arm. The highly noteworthy happen-
ing at the el'elllllg was the election of
Rlltll Mthvem, Alice Crubti-ee and
Mabel Blair as the most popular, the
prettiest and the most talented women

respectively, in the College.

Except tor a lew who “wanted to see
the Gil'ls’ Colonial," the entire male
population or the institution was pres-
ciit and in a hilarious mood.

in the voting contests Ruth McGov-
l'en Carl‘ll‘d by at sale margin, as the
mast populaar girl, with Norma cFl-
lows second and Pearle Taylor third.
The beauty conteSL was close, Alice
Critbtreo winning trot-o Lona Sylvester

der tied for third. The most mlented
girl in College proved to be Mabel
Blair, with Ellzabetll Drott second and
Mery Rees 'third. Having disposed oi
this matter, the men then took up the
perplexing taslt or deciding upon the
liomelicst man in our midst. Aiter
lengthy consideration and debate, “Liz"
Jones was paid this tribute by his fol-
low schoolmates'altlio “Little Jiegs"l
Macy and Fred Butter-held were hached
splritedlv by their respective lactioiis.
