mg a slight shade on thcir rir
the race tor po ’ans.

Lopor-, Lynch, anti Greenwood are
having a hot ﬁght for the pivot position,
mitt lroriors'arc almost cr-en. Loper is
possible a better player than the other
two, but ire does not tit as well into
the loam-work, and is much liantlloay

ing in the contest for the vacant guard

that Ille strength oi the team tlilis year

tories we gain will not he the resuﬁ:

in spite at tho mediocre showing
