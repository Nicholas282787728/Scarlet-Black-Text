Domlrl‘onl' GOVERNMENT

The appointment of Professor .1. 1".
Ryan as Julliol' dean of men th gen-
e'i l oversight of the men's dormitories
\viH make possible a decidedly better-
scheme of govcrninent at the new
buildings. The change is in no sense
a breaking-away from the idea of self-
goi-ernment adopted at the ﬁrst, but
rather a perfecting ot the plan or gov»
eminent.
i Some dissatisfaction has resulted
from the old system under which the
government was in the hands of a com-
mittee o1 twenty-one, including the six
house chairmen, twelve elected ”ﬂoor
representatives," and three members
of the faculty. There was too much
dittusion ot authority; there was no
responsible executive body.

Under the plan now being worked
out the government ivill rest definitely
in a cabinet of seven, composed of the
six house chairmen and the junior-
dean of men as presiding officer with
veto power. This cabinet has been
given full authorily. with the dean as
chief executive officer. A general as-
sembly of all the men Iivlng or eating
.at the dormitories will meet from time
to time to consider matters of common
interest.

The 'choice ht Professor Ryan as the
faculty member of the cabinet nneets
with-ihedecided approval of the dor-
initory men. Mr. Ryan is popular with
the men. and has their conﬁdence be—
cause oi his fall-rmlndedness. He is
sure’ to have their co-operation in halls
dling dormitory affairs
