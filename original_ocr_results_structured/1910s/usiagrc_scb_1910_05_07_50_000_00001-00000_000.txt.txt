Questions Ad‘kcil by Students of
tire Collcyc.

A remarkable series or chapel talks
Proiessoi-
the
On Tuesday morning, Ur

were given this week by

Steiner, who had charge of all
services.
Steiner brought out the duligers oi the
Judasslllie malerialisiii which is prerw
lent in the world today. In our love
ior money values we lose sight oi the

priceless things, Wednesdays talk
was mainly an indictment oi ‘groull
immoi-alit College nien especially
are sway-er by this slavery to the acts
oi groups or mobs, and to things which,
when alone. they would repudiate.
They are mastered by the bad habits oi
others. On Thursday he answered the
great question oi what Christ meant
to him. Though he said that it was
impossible to do this, adequately. he
gave some lotty ideas, bringing out the
thought that Christ iurnislied a view oi
God that he might accept, and showed
the true meaning or liie.

Yesterday, Dr. Steiner devoted his
time to answering questions which were
handed in, according to his request, by
various students, Several students oi
a serio-comic nature were answered
and also a number or deep and thought-
iul ones, Among the questions asked
and answered here tlies

Q. What do you think or college
clubs? A. it is a very diiiicwlt task
ior students to pick out the group oi
men with whom they may best associ~
ate. The basic idea oi getting a num-
ber oi boys or dirterent types and
lclasses together is good but the dim-
culties in the way 01 selt selection by
the men themselves are well nigti un~
surmountable.

q. Why should i join church, when
1 have outgrown my old iaithi A, For
three reasons. First—because the
church is the one place where society
gives expression to its spi itiial need
SecondiBecause it is the main organi-
zation which prevents many commun
,ties ii-oni losing rhei democracy.
Third—Because ii you are truly liberal
you will be tolerant with the intoler-
ant. You should learn to know the
point oi view which you call narrow
'or you will be very narrow yourseli.

Q. How can I prepare inyseli ior
social work? A. A great deal or this
work is done voluntarily rather than
by' proiessional workers. You should
prepare by becoming as broadly inter-7
ested as possible by studying in all
ﬁelds, emphasizing economics, history.
the languages, etc. Remember that
you should be doing this work now all
the time~your ﬁeld is everywhere and
the time no .

Q. As a Bible study leader, how
shall i make the work less intellectual
and more spiritual? A. This is iioiii
question at method but oi attitude.
li you have the right attitude you can
make the work spiritual. it not, you
should not attempt the work.

Q. is belict in n personal God es-
sential to a li'ellrl‘ounded religiont
A. a mystical sort oi religion could
be maintained without such a pellet.
.ut actual religion which relates man
with his iellows must have this pain
sonal reatur . There can be no bro-
therhood oi man without the rather»
hood or God.

0. How know Christ?
A. There are iour ways oi knowing
Hlm: (1-) Hear about Him; (2) Read
what He says; (3) See Hlm in the
characters oi His ioilowers; (4) incor-
porate Hls teachings into your own
liie.

the activities of the day.

The attention oi the council was cdll-
ed to the unsightly condition of the
campus—especially the waste about
the heating plant and the unsightly
appearance or the doors on the Associ-
ation buildings. A request was made
that these be improved lieiore the etch-
sion or the state meet, it was also
docided to request the department oi
Buildings and Grounds to place the
wires across the paths on the campus
as was done last year.

gram—All Number-r Enthusiasti-
Cully Received.

The Faculty oi the School oi Music
appeared in concert last night at the
chapel, and ﬁttingly closed the year's
recital course with an artistic and well
executed program.

Mrs. Kennedy appeared in the ﬁrst
number with a charming rendition oi a
group or tour piano solos. This was
iollowed by a vocal group by Mr. Ly
man, whose rich, sympathetic voice
lent itselt particularly well to the
rendition ol Toliaikowsky and Grieg.

Beethoven‘s Trio ior 'cello, violin,
and piano. given by Mrs. Pierce, Mr.
Pork and Mr Pierce was the least an
preciated niiniber oi the program, and
did not seem equal in artistic merit to
the other numbers.

iioweriul soprano voice, lier nial'lieil
dramatic qualities or interpretation,
and that indetliiilile attribute oi the
artist that Co .plctely wins the nlllllr
eiice, easily tar ed oii the honors or
the evening. Her last selection was
par icriiiirlv appreciated, and was re
poated as an encore. The organ ac-
toiiiiiaiiiiiicnts by Mr. Matlack added
much to the elicctiveness or this group

three runs respectively on seven hits

Ficken for Gl'lnnell pitched good ball
with the exception of the filth arid sev-
enth innings when Nebraska secured
her runs. Part oi the hits in these in-
nings were (lue to the rather weak sup
port in the outﬁeld. This is partly,
due to the new grandstand as the sun
glaring upon the white timbers or
that Structure make it almost impos-
sible to see a ﬂy ball until it reaches
its height and then usually it is too
late w ﬁeld it.

team with a score or ii: The ﬁrst
two inirriigs cinrlied the game ior Gl'ln—
iiell when rollr runs were scorn-ed in
each inning due to a rather generous
slit or iii - on tho pnit oi the Penn
pitcher, Bench, arid the weak support
that he rere ed iroin his team. In
the third inning he held his own to bet»
ter- advantage and From that time Penn
played inirly reditabie hall.

Zcizler was in the boy ior the sec-
olld time ior G innell and pitched his
team to victory. Twice he found
himself in a slit hole, once in [lie
screnth “hen with bases full and no
outs he innned the ﬁrst man up and
a fast double play retired the side.
Again in the ninth Penn ﬁlled the
bases and for a moment when Klein
railed to ﬁeld a rest grounded it looked
as though the Penn would score again
