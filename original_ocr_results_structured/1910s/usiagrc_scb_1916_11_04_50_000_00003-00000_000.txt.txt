BATTLE IS 218T WITH DRAKE

(Continued from Pugs One)

iiig’ Gl‘lhnell, Drake has realized
nine shut-outs, Griuncll iii-e. Twice
the latter has won by the slender
margin of one point, and once by only
two points. However, saline or the
games , c has lost went to Drake only
by a . iglit margin. The Des Monies
university has the honor of having
made the biggest score, for in 190-1
she won by a 67-0 count. Gi-iniiell
runs a Cl e second with the 58-0 game
or last ca.
Rig GiHlH‘S ill 1912 mu] 1915.
Prubably two of the mast {mucus

.galiies from a Grinncll standpoint were

those of 1m and 1915, The former
broke Drake‘s winning streak oi four
years standing with a 134) score. The
game placed “Bill" Sherman, “Red"
Egan and "Formation B" in Grinii'Ql's
hall of lame tor-crer, and gained for
the two men mentioned, places or the
all-state eleven. The 1915 game can
never lie tor-gotten by those who wit-
nessed it, and that means most of the
Griiiiiell strident body at that time.

After having seen Drake win only
by low scores for the two years prc-
rioris, the 5370 "grand slam" was all
the more enjoyable. Only one team,
lirnnesotn, has ever handed Drake a
worse drubbing, and Grinnell‘s chant
at i y last year was “We bent ’el‘n
worse than Nebraska did."

“It is the greatest thing Griiincll
(,ollcgc can do,” was the comment
uliiclr l, . Winﬁeld Scott Hall, Protes-
sor or I’ll lology at Northwestern my
TV , iiindc Thursday ‘aitcrnoon
wrlli rciercncc to Grinncll's- new tlor»
“it will undoubted-
ly create a iiew spirit or loyalty which
will come to be the highest [actor in
Gi-iiiilcll lite," he said, when inter»
viewed by a reporter lol- The Scarlet
and Black.

“There is no doubt in my mind," he
continued, “that the best thing a col-
lege can do is to have the majority of
its student holly living in a group of
closely connected buildings. Their
close association wrih each other
brings them into better relations and
promotes an atmosphere of prit dc
corps and a, fraternal sp it which
comes in no other way."

Compares With Ollu‘l' Universities.

Dr. Hall made a comparison between
the dormitory systems or Cambridge,
Oxford, and Nortliwcstor , aud‘tlle
lack of them at great universities like
Columbiri and Chicago. The former
had the advantage, he thought. After
a trial oi two years, Northwestern is
as i-ahidly as possible housing all the
strident body in dormitories on the
college campus. "They are an uri-
dildliii'cd success," he sold.

\T'itli Tolerance to the electile SY
tom as applied tu college doriuitorie
Dr. Hall was doubtful of its success.
“The dormitories are not elective in
England and ill most American llni~
rel-suites,“ he stated. “Princeton clubs
are electil'c but open only to the two
upper Classes, while the dormitories
at that place are nut in any sense
clectiyc. It may be a good plan, but
I am very doubtful oi the development
of the spirit of democracy under the
elective plan," he Said, summing up
his news

Dr. llilll Lilirs Quiitlrniiglr.

Dr. Hall has been in Grillnell on
several previous occasions, the last
time being three years ago. This was
before the girls dormitories were built
and he was delighted With them. In
his brief tour of the Quadrangle, he
made many expressions of delight at
"the attractive and wholesome home”
as lie styled it. "If the men‘s (lormi—
tm'les Work ollt as well as the girls’
seem to have, and no doubt they will,
I feel sure it will be but a few years
until all Griulloll's men will be hous-
ed ill College dormitories similar to the
Quadrangle."

Di. Hall is now on a tour of col-
leges under the auspices or the Na—
tlontll Y. M. C. A. Committee. no (ice
