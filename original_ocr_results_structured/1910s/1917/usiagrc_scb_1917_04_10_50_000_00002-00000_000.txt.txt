striking in its suddcnness and amaL
ing in its significance, came the news
some time ago of a revolt among
Princeton students against the club
system there, It was a student moves
mom for democracy in a university
where the power of tradition is for»
midahle. ‘
Close upon the trail of the Princes
ton revolt came the news of a some-
,what similar mmement at Mills Col-
lege in California, a. gil'ls’ school. In
the western college two girls‘ sororr
ties disbanded 01 their own free will
because they thought their existence
was a detriment to the welfare of
their institution. The decision came
unannounced and unheralded. Its aim
was democracy.
Now Just what do these two steps
indicate? If there were not milar
instances of student groups e ry day

“of handing together to form fraternities

and sore 'ties we might say that it
showed e rdenee of a universal move
merit toward student democracy. But
the forming of the smaller groups pre-
cludes this belief. All of these move!
roents do show, however, that there is
a continual attempt on the part of stile
dents to adjust themselves socially.

Gi'iilnell h - a similar problem. Be»
cause many wonderful advantages are
offered in Grmneii social life it does
not loom rip as a very big one. Yet rt
is present and its solution would help
to give that side of the college a high
or standard it is a problem which
has been voiced before in those col—i
rrrrrns and it merits attention again,
Bl'iell., it is this:

Two years ago, Grrnnell was a typis
eal "family“ with her men and women
thrown into each others presence con-
tinually. When the Quadrangle was
constructed the two sesz were some:
what separated. Their acquaintance
with each other became limited [argue

best bring only a superficial friends

ip as contrasted with the intimate
trionds made at the former mixed
boarding clubs, Many girls now feel
that they do not meet enough men, and
rriariy men feel the same way about
the girls, This feature, so valuable a
part of the "G 'nnell family" or a few
years ago, might to be preserved. How
to do it i the question.

Many have felt that some form of
properi regulated dancing would help
materially. We think that vacation
dances ought to he held on the campus}

other reason than for the safety of the
college girl. Those who have aitcnded
location dances seem to give them
strong support as one step in preserv-

help. too.

sets fifteen.

There are two reasons as to why the
system should he changed back to
where it was formerly. One is that it
is unwise to let so ranch depend upon
an irnfair system of judging program
Thirty points ‘towards a trophy is atlr
most enough to decide the winner, yet
this is done by an unsatisfactory sys-
tem of awarding these thi y points.

The second reason why the change
should be made is to right a wrong.
The Debating Union aeted without all,
tlrerity, and their mistake should be
made good. Why not take this step at
the next meeting, of the Union before
a winner at programs has been decldr
cd'! Then it would he row to all so-
cieties.
