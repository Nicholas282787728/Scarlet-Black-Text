call it by some such name as “the ﬁve
minute rule." .

Its clfect would be this. Men in the
dormitory would not ' bring their
parents or othcr visitors to the build—

the nren in the house. No college
guests, either men or women. would

similar warning

The reason ior such a regulation rs
cosy to under-stand. The dormitories
are the men's orvn homes. They

and to go from room to room without
being prepared to entertain ‘ itors.

"A man’s mom is his own castle."
While every Gl'iunell man aims to
keep his room in good order, it is not
to be expected that he should want a
group 0; laculty men and theirrvive

All Allunllil’s View on Smithy Dilles

Times change. conditions change.
problems change; thcrelcrc one who
has been out at school a ten years has
no right to say anything. Yet the
Sunday date question has any-lays been
such a vivid red rag to her that she
thinks her evolution or thought mar-
he at some help to other questioner-s.

When she was a sophomore she was
rapidly in favor of Sunday dates—
ready to ﬁght ior them on any occa—
sion and capable of socing no other
point of vie Sunday dates in open
parliament were voted down and she
was hear-throken and unable to run
derstand the way the universe or col.
legs or talks were run anyway.

She grew older. Friendships curl—
tirrrred.vcry dear and sacred. So did
Sundays. ‘Her college world was busyr
busy, hlrsy. and then busy, for she was

the whole week when you could give
time to your friends.

The sophomore would have said,
“Let those who want dates have them.
Just hecause you can doesn't mean
that you've got to.”

Ah, but is that true7

The junior answered: "No. that
wouldn't make it the same; if you
could have a date you would have one.
He’d think he had to ask you; you'd
think you couldn’t turn him down
and you couldn‘t without his misun-
derstanding, while it he didn't ask {or
one you’d he hurt. Besides some woutd
