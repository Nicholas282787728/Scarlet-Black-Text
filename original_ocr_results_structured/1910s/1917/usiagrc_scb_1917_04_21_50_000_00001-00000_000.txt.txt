Sentiment in 'r ‘ Part of Country
Does Not river Abolishing Millet-
ics As Alll'oclltf-d lly Universi-
tits in the bust.

Since the actual entrance of the
,United States into the war, the realiz-
ation of me great task before the na-
tion has resulted in the adoption of
some form of militaiy training in
nearly every college.in the nation. In
the east many colleges have dropped
athletics entirely in an effort to em.
ploy their time to the best advantage
in preparing for the part which will
fall to the college man» In the middle
West Various plans have been adopted
whereby in some colleges the men
take drill three hours every day, and
' in others the chapel hour is set aside

for that purpose.

West For Athletics.

Sentiment in the west does not favor
the abolishment of athletics. The
Daily Illini, the student newspaper of
the University of Illinois, brings out
the fact that even West Point has not
abandoned her athletic schedules for
the rest of the year, Few college pub-

lications advocate the immediate an» ’

listment, although the University of
Kansas has just lately given up fol-me
ing a company formed entirely of stu-
dents.

Iowa United.

In Iowa colleges the movement is
general. At Iowa and Amos, where
some form of military,training has
been compulsory, the pi blem was not
as difficult as for the independent col—
leges. 006 has establlled a system
whereby three companies drill three
times per week at the chapel hour,
which time is supposed to put the men
out the least, as chapel attendance is
compulsory there. At Drake univer-
sity, 250 men responded to a. call
which was issued as compulsory. The
Work is in charge of Captain W. A.
Graham of the Iowa National Guard.

Cornell Drills Dnily

At Cornell as well as here in Grin-
nell, Captain M. C. Mllmmx of the
State University and his as. stems are
in charge of the will T lee com-
panies of men are drilling every day
at Mt, Vernon, 21an two drill periods a
day have been established.

One hundred and fifty inch respond—
ed to the call at Highland Park an
elected officers. The drill work takes
place at 6:30 to 7:30 p. m,, on Moll-
days, Wednesdays and Fridays, and is
in charge of Colonel Lambert of the
regular army.

At Amos an hour a day is put aside

for drill and efforts are being made to l

bring the enrollment close to the total
male enrollment of the college.
East Drops Athletics.

At Wisconsin voluntary drill has
brought out practically all the men.
At Yale, Colombia and many other
eastern universities athletics have
been given up. Interest runs high at
the University of Kansas. An attempt
was made to have a university com-
pany of the national guard, but the
bars bad to be let down with tllirtyA
five vacancies to fill. A six weeks’
course, training for army mechanics,
signal corps, etc., w l begin soon.

Minnesota Unive ity has a, training
corps whose members devote three
hours evciy day to military drill. In
a late issue of the Minnesota Daily is
found a stirring appeal to increase it
to four, calling three hours a ”paltry
service." '

Carleton has 82 men registered for

for the establishment of some system.

Also on the Program.
,

The Minneapolis Symphony orches-
tra under the leadership of Emil 0b,
erhoffer will be the chief attraction at
the approaching May Festival. This
orchestra, founded fifteen years ago
under l Oberhoffer's direction by
the public spirited men of lilinncapo»
lis, has steadily grown in ability and
prestige, and is now ranked by capable
critics as one of the thice bcst oi»
cliestras in the United States. In New
York City itself the metropolitan crit—
ics went so far as to say that it is sue
perior to any New York. orchestra, and
one Boston critic affirmed that there
was no great difference between the
Minneapolis Orchestra and the Boston
Symphony, generally hckl to be the
top notch in American orchestras.

Another significant indication of the
growing fame of the Minneapolis 01”
clicstva is the fact u tsbeing engaged
for the annual North Shore Music F -
tlral in Chicago, on event of the h
magnitude, and for which only the

heodore Thomas oi-clic. ra has ever
' layed llnlil tbi season. Both the
Thomas Orchestra and the New York
Symphony have becn board in Grin-
hell in the last few years, and it will
be possible Lo determine to some ex
tent the relative me ’ts of each Ono‘s
,clainis to SnDcrim y. That the Min-
ncapolis Orchestra will fulfill all the
requirements which the high quality-
of the Grinncll festivals in the past
has established is certain.

A group of distinguished soloists
will app or at the resli 1. The vocal
soloists are:
Jean Cooper, contralt , Charles Hal

ranks of concert artists, and are zil-

records. Miss Kaiser and b . Daily

(By Prof. L. D. Hartson.)

The Home concert for almost a
quarter of a century has been one of
the big events of the college year.
During recent years, due to the multi-
plicity of cvents and to the unfortunate
idea that the concert hall must neces-
sarily be a rose garden, there has
been a gradual increase in the number
of empty seats. This year, however,
the management of the club has
preached the gospel of democracy,
with the gratifying result that the cha<
Del was well filled. And the audience
certainly did enjoy the concert, which
was splendid!

War Is Dominant.

The dominant note was the demo-
Icratic theme of war, which appeared
in vocal solos, the stunt, and in the
chorus numbers. The opening num»
her was Bullal setting of the Span-
ish ballad, The Sword of Ferrara. Ten
years ago the club attempted this song.
but gave it up. This year's club must
be better, for they sang it with perfect
case. it is a magnificent song, and we
hope to hear it in many future con-
certs. The other heavy choral num—
ber, Liebe's Cllql'al, celebrates the Vic-
tory of Prussia on Lenten Field, and
.the beginning of their period of domi—
nance over central Europe It Was a
song of triumph such as an army
might sing, the powerful. bass section

suggesting the singing of a. whole rcg-
inielit.

Softcr'ilusic Too.

i The club . ablc to do the softer,
sweeter music as well as the heroic.
as was shown by their rendition of
the well known Santa Lucia and Schli-
malln’s Love, and Traumerei. The
club did not use the once effective
dorkencd stage effect for the negro
songs this Year, and they introduced
two perfectly fine glee songs, De Cop-
pah Moon and Turkey in the Straw.
The clcnient of fun was heightened by
the well selected cncores, The Bill of
Fare, There was a Farmer, My Old
Banjo, A Medley, the ballad about the
hen and the carp that laid a million
eggs, and The Laughing Song.

soloists Please.

The soloists were Philip Kelleher
and the director, Mr. David Peck. Mr.
Kelleher sang two War songs, The
Song of Hybrias tllc Cretan, by El-
liott, and as an Cncm War, by Rage
ers. His work this real shows marked
improvement, particula in the
sweetness of his tone and in the flex»
ibility of his voice. Seldom in the
history of the club have they had so
talented a soloist. There have been
many suggcsfioils in times past con—
cerning ways to improvc the Home
concert, hilt never once have wc heard
anyone wish that y , Peck would leave
his violin at home. This year he fle—
lighted us by playing an Andante, by
Lalo, and a Romance by siier. His
technique shows an increase in the
case with the result that his hearers
are more and more ablc to [ac] with
