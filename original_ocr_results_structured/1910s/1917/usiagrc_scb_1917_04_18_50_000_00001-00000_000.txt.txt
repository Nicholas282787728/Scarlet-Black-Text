Brent—Shut Relay Team
Hns Two 0111 Members!

Contrary to early predictions Grin-
nell will only be represented in two
events at the Drake relays next Satul‘r
day. These will he the half mile and
two mile relays. This is the first two
mile team Grinnell has ever entered.
Last year a mile team was sent, but
this Year on account of lack of inter-
est from those Who have run the qua -
ter mile before, on account of current
conditionsY and on account of ineligi~
bility of others, it is impossible to
make up a team.

Men Picked in Home Meet.

The half mile team will be composed
of Burden, Darrow, Minty, and "chuck"
Hoyt. The tu'o»mile team will be
Sprinkle, J. B. MccGregor, Fleck, and
Paul liiacGl-egor. These men were se-
lected from their showing made in the
Home meet last Saturday and the
entries were sent in to Drake yestelu
day. All will run In the order named
above.

Nothing can he said as to the press
pects of either team. The short relay
team has only two of the men this year
Who Were on the same team that Won
last year at the carnival.

Competition in Two-mic.

The tum-mile team Will have strong
competition from what is known of
the other entries. Morningsidc, which
won this event last year, and several
other times, is sending a quartet com—
posed for the most part of experienced
men. Carleton is also entered and has
a Very strong team. ‘Coe, Cornell and
South Dakota. Will also be represented
as they were last year,

“Highs" Is Spccihl Event.

The special event will be the 120
high hurdles, This race will attract
attention from all over the country.

_brnken elcvcn work s records in the

"Wliat We need above all at this

in his chapel tall: this morning.

"I should dislike to think that thorc

would be behind others in the call to
duty," continued the speaker, "but i
should also dislike to, think that ally
of you should be over hasty about the
matter of enlistment."

"Collcgc men should be more valu-
able than tlic unlr ned men,“ he said.
”It is no discredit to a college man to
think of an official po. tion in the
fighting rank, for they die as neces-

A. C. A. SAYS COLLEGES
SHOULD DO THEIR PART

That college people should “do their
hit” in thc pi-cscut international cri s
was one of the main themes of the
American Collcziatc association which
was held in Wa hiugton last week, and
from which M s Road and ]\I' 5 Mill-
erd, the Grilmell representatives, have
just returned.

The A. C. A. is an organization for
college graduates which meets bienni-
ally to discuss fhc problems of tho VZIA
rioiis colleges throughout the country.
This year particular emphasis was laid
upon the importance of economy at the
present time, among college students

Three New Records. -

Besides taking individual honors
‘with 15 points, "Chuck” Hoyt added
to his long list of records in tho lilo
and 220. Setting a pace‘ at ten yards
every second, “Chuck" negotiated iho‘
hundred in a flat, and the 220 in
:22. Accor ng to "Doc" Huff, those
records put the old ones in the shade, ,
and put up a. good mark for future
generations to shoot at. Eoehmler, ’20,
hung up the other record in the pole
vault, with a leap of la feet 9 inches,
which tops the old record made by
Clark, ’10, by one inch.

thf Is Pretty Race.

A track which was a little soft, and
a stiff wind on the backsstretch was
I the savior for other records, especially
in the half mile and the two relays,
The half was one of the prettiest races
,ol the day. and Sprinkles tune of
‘ :0523 was remarkable considering the
handicaps under which he ran. It was
:a nip and tuck race between Sprinkle
land Paul MacGregor, u' ‘ the former
winning out due to a pretty sprint on
the straightaway. Stock came within

home record in die high jump with a
