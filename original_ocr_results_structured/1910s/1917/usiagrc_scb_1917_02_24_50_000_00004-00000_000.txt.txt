tioli l'illlel's.

Dr. John Gardner, pastor oi the New
England Congregational church, Chi-
cago, taking as his subject “Thinking
. incl-lea" and as its background
George Washington, gave a chapel talk

- that kept his audience in breathless

attention last Thursday morning. Dr.

‘ Gardner explained that he was hand.-

capped by the (act that he had only
been in this country [our and a halt

, years, having come from England and

therefore could not speak as “one oi
us,” having just taken out his first

. naturalization papers.

English \‘iuu.

"George Washington, according to
the English View," he said, "Wiis the
greatest leader that had evel stood. at.
the head OiY any nation.” But in his
reading he said he had found that

Deleon who, although confronted with
great responsmihucs and carrying a
great burden, had given himsellhp to
the people 0[ Amelica. This, Di‘. Gill'tlr
nei- called the "American Spillt." He
said that Washington determined her
lore his death that America should be
some day recognized as the highest
and greatest nation in every counsel
in Europe. “This self-respect,” Said
Dr. Gal dnel‘, “is the foundation of DB.-
tionallsm.“

This self-respect and the fact that
each belongs to the other is the one
great lesson for Every college man to

lege man must be something more
than a mere thing on two legs."

Afraid of Glins.

The ability to think in terms of men
regardless of skin or wealth is the
lesson that America must learn, ac-
cording to Dr. Gardner. \Ve have great
social problems which must be solved
and we can not live in happiness or
peace until we do, he said. He agreed
with a. certain thinking American that

but he thought that the time had now‘

The trouble Will—i America, according
to Dr. Gardner, was that it was afraid
of the sight of blood or the sound of a
sun. 7

At the opening of the sol-Vice, which
was in commemoration of both Lmr
coin and Washington, the Orchestra
played the “Star Spangled Banner.”
They also plnycd the hymn “Ameri

Afterwards the Men's Glee club Sang

The Grinnell glcc clubs will not npa
pear in the annual Eisteddfod at Dcs
Monies this year, it was stated this
morning. The demands of other work.
and lack or time for preparation have
been given as reasons for giving up
the contest this year.

For three years the Grinncll glee
clubs have tulien part in this singing
contest which is held annually in Des
Moincs. Last year, the Girls Glee club
tool: iii-st prize, the quartet Iran) the
lion's Glee club first prize, and the
mixed chorus took second prize in the
group singing.

The Eisteddfod is a \Velch contest
open to any group or amateur singers.
Originated by the Wclch, the idea has
become so popular that now the con-
test is not peculiar to the Welch ex—
cept in name. cool-uses from Des
Moines and \i'illiamsburg churches air
so take part. This annual contest in
group singing has proved an admirable
means or awakening an interest in
singing or all kinds.
