GRINNELLIANS ABE
AT stunts GAMP

11 Fred Miller, ex its
LLING, . inn., sept. 24
news comes up here of the mohii
tion 01 Grinnellians to another yeal
work 1 ﬁnd myselr crazier than ever
to he one of‘lhem again.

I never saw a Grinuellian yet who
wasn't crazy tor school to start when
toll rolled around, and when the
privilege or attending is positively
denied, one very clearly realizes how
tortunate are those to whom that
pi vilege is extended. so here’s to
this year's Gr lllcllians, old and new.
may you have the best year in the
history or the school.

This Camp is Different

As tor the school that I’m attend
ing here, I suppose you all have
heard so much about the last camp
that you would hear very little new
were I to describe this one in very
great detail. But there are a tew
dirterenees between the two that
might he of interest.

The work is ahoiit the same. I
think; I teel sure we are kept Just
as busy {tom 45 a. in. to o p. m.
as were our predecessors, for I have
not as yet been able to discover very
many idle moments.

However, one dirterenee is quite
apparent. The ﬁrst camp had to
work during the hottest days of the
year, and the strenuous work was
taxing at times.

Weather Makes ’91“ Work ,

So tar for us. the weather has been
ideal, neither too hot nor too cold,
just "gm to inahe a tellow enjoy
working hard. As a result there
have been very tew instances in
which men have been (creed to drop
out because they could not stand the
work,

The personnel ot this camp is quite
dirterent also, The ﬁrst camp was
made up largely or younger men. In
this camp practically all the men are
25 and over. There are only about
5 men out ct every lilo who are
under 24 years of age.

At ﬁrst, we of the younger set ieit
sort of lost. but we were soon kept
so busy that the age of our come
panions made little ditterence.

“Field Artillery tor Me”

When we entered the camp we had
hi make our selections between the
infantry. ﬁeld artillery and coast are
tiller-y at once, whereas the men or
the ﬁrst camp were all given ills
rant y training the ﬁrst ﬁve weeks.
Since I chose the ﬁeld artillery that
is the only branch I know much
about. .

At ﬁrst we were able to make use
of the guns and caissons ot the First
Minnesota Field Artillery. and our
work was intensively artillery. But

FIRST GLEE CLUB TRYOU’I‘
NEXT SATURDAY AFTERNOON

The ﬁrst trysout for the Men's Glee
Club will he held next Saturday alto
noon, in the Music Hall at 1:30 p. in.
The second and third tryouts will be
announced later.

There are eight vacancies in the
club this year, three in the ﬁrst
tenor scction, three in the baritone,
and two in the second bass. It is
possible that there Will hc one vat»
cancy in the second tenor, pending
the return or one man to college.

Every man in college who has ever
had any experience whatever in sing
ing is urgcd to tryout, particularly
rtll freshmen. The high class of men
who have entered college seems to
indicate that the club will llphold its
standard this year.

they have left for France and their
material has shipped back to the
Rock Island Arsenal.

That has handicapped us a. great
deal. we have since been issued
riﬂes and have spent a lot of time
on inlantry drill. However our work
diiters from that oi the infantry, in
that we spend a great deal of time
on ﬁring data, semaphore, wigru'ztg
and buzzer signalling, pistol practice,
and road and panoramic sketching,
while we are spared the bayonet
drills, and work on the riﬂe range.

since there are so few younger
men here. and those that are. are so
widely scattered I have notrun across
many Old Grinnellians There are a
great many “old time 5” here I am
sure, hut as they were before my
time I am not well posted on them
either.

However, there are a few alumni
whom I have met here, among them,
V. Began, '13, Leon Brody, ‘14, Roger
ELeavitt, '17. John Leavitt. Bert Mills
‘ai-itl L. L. Ricketts. Lloyd Taylor, ‘14.

ustructor in mathematics, was
ith the coast artillery, who were
next door to us. But they were
transferred to Fortress Monroe in
Virginia last week.

College Ellen in Mir ty

The men as a whole have come
from Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and
the Dakotas. They are practically
all college inch and all of the best
class. One could hardly ask to he
with better associates. And if the
weather continues, the whole course
of the comp should prove to be three
months or the host kind at outdoor
life.

since I’m only on furlough here
from the signal reserve, I fear my
education is sure to be interrupted
for some time to come But nevei-
theless, I’m looking fan d to a fall
when I, too, may be star ng out once
more on a year’s study at the “Best
in the West."
