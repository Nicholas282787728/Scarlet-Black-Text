of 1913, and it wast liroiish his grcztt

place on the football man. At his

Tollctson comes to Gi‘lmicll highly
l‘ecmnmcnded. During the seasons or
1912 and 1913 he was the quarters
hack on the Minnesota team and his
great work placed him in Minnesota's
hall of fame.

He w s a teammate of both
Alinon and Salem. His coaching
ocricncc has been with orofes ’onal
teams in Minneapolis. and invariably
his work has been successful.
it is quite likely that in his work
at Grinnell he will carry out the Mills
nesota system which has secured
such good results in the past two
seasons. For the most part, he i ll
have an experienced squad with
which to work, and Grinncli expects
much from her new coach.

The high class tl' 1i squads which
