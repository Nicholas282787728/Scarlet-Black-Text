her of college-grade students among
all the Christian colleges of China, and
stands in thc center of a population of
fifty millions.

Started By Bellini“.

The Grinncl ' -China movement
was formulated in 1910 by Rev. A. B.
Del-loan. ’06, a missionary of the Am-
erican Board, now located in the Shan—
tuug province. President Main saw its
great pus. hilities, and gave every cu-
couragement to the plan, with the re
sult that it was formally started in
1913. It co 'esponds very closely with
"Dartmouth -Turkcy," ”Oberlin-in-
Chiur,” and 000’s contemplated move
in the Philippines, although on a much
larger scale than any of these. This
plan has brought more publicity to
Grinnell than any other activity in
which the college has engaged, not ex-
cepting athletics.

Tomorrow's speaker is a brother of
Sherman Eddy, one of the foremost Y.
M. C. A. leaders in the United States.
and a coworker with John R. Mott.
Both are associated in the internation-
al movement to evangelize the world.
