that under actual exi, ng circuim

such a step should be taken."

.llilny At Hul'vill'll.

At Harvard 600 students have alrea-
dy- signilicd their willingness to elect
a course in military science which is
about to be given theic. The student
council in the same institution has is-
sued an appeal for more signers. An
immense audience at students attend-
ed a military mass meeting held in
Cambridge a week ago Tuesday. Pres-
irlent Lowell of Harvard urged the men
in an impassioned addrcss to give heed
to the responsibility which rests upon
them.

The Harvard Crimson, in an editor
ial publ her} on tile following monk
ing, criticizes the student body bittei»
ly for an indilfcrcnce to the sel‘iousA
ness of America's situation, which has
only produced 600 signers for the
course in military science.

Dartmouth has had a lecture course
in military science for more than a
year and from all reports it has proven
satisfactory in every respect.
