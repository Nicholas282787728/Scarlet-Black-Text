‘IIMBIIIIIUS AS WELL AS
‘ UNUSUAL”, IS COMMENT

lligli in 'se Glynn rroi'. L. B. Scllu'e
By “Mllsicnl New" roi- llis lie.-
cital in Chicago During lic—
cciit viiculion.

Unusual praise is accorded Prot. d-i
ward l3. Schevc, instructor oi organ
and composition in the School or Mu-‘
sic. in the last issue or the Music
News, a Chicago weehly publication.‘
The comment is made upon a recital
given by Professor Sclieve at the
Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicdr‘
go last Christmas time. I

The review oi the medal is consid—
ered in local musical circles to be
quite an honor [or Protessor Schevc.
The Music News is tree with its cri -
cisms and does not rail to call atten—
tion to any demerits in anything mua‘
sical, On another page ohthe same ISA ‘

to which contains the Schevc article,
appears a scathing criticism or another ‘
leading grand opera company.

The story as it appeared in the Mu-
sic News is as follows: 1
“Edward 13. SCIICVC, of Grinnell Col-
lege, 1a., gave a recital at the Fourth,
Presbyterian Church last Thursdayr
which was heard by the usual small.

Holiday andicnce but which was of a‘
value to have warranted a church full
or people.

"Those who were privileged to hear
in”. Sclieve will long remember his au-
thority and his artistry.

"Not as a player alone did he ap-
pear but. primarily, as a Composer
-tor his ‘Aleditation on Quotations from
Ithe Psalms' formed the most import-
:ant division oi the program.

"This very important woi room 1

pei-loi-niance, is in the form of a Suitel

‘ei' to Thee,’ Reverie How wonderinl

lTheei' -

“It will he soon at once that this is
an ambitious as well as a very uu-i
jusnal program and in the writing of.
‘it Mr. Scheve has displayedall tllnI.‘
solidity ot musicianship and that tech-

ical skill which have marked his pro
.vioiisly hoard compositions.

"He has done nlol‘eifoi'. unquestion-
‘zthly he has been ahle'to introduce a
,lrast wealth or modernism in a most
crieetivc as well as beautitul way Limit
‘the work therefore not only arrestsl
immediate attention but it also holds
it to the end and any audience so for-
tunate as to have it placed before them
most needs be gratetul.

“It goes without saying that the Or~
gait part oi this Suite was played or»
ccptionauy well by Sch 7 ror to
abundant musical perception he adds
iine technical etiuipmcntand the yin-
lin line was invested with musician-
ship, warm tone and arti tic finish by
Graham Harris, a young violinist who
is ve y much worth while.

“Mr. Sclicrc played also ‘An Irish
Ln" (Giahiger) with quaint charm, a
‘Pardplil‘ase on a Russian Vesper
Hymii' (hortiiyansh-i) with interesting
ditrerentiations and Bach and Handel.
numbc s with clarity and breadth and
a ‘F val Postlllde' (Voikinar) wilhl
brilliant technical display and mnchI
effect.”
