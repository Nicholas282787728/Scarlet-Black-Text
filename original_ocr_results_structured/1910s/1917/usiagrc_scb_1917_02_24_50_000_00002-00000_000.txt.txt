A lid-urn RESIN).

One or the greatest suiorises ot the.
year among college newspapers has’
beeiutlic immediate anti almost uni-
versal support given to our recent pro
posal hacked by Amos, Coe, Cornell
and Gl‘lunell, that college newspaper
men of Iowa meet in a convention ior
discussions and to hear spoeclies. Col-
lege edito » are not lnlzeuarin tor a
qollvemlou,—they are stiong tor it.

The hearty way in which our con-
teniporaries over the state are beating
the plan is shown in their editorial
comment. The Scarlet and Black ed-
itorial suggesting the meetings, al-

~though a whole column long, was
printed word tor word hy the times
Iowa state Student. the Di-alte Delphic,
,the Sinipsonian. the Leander Clarl:
Record, the Cornellian, and other par
fiers over the state. Several oi then-t
suggest ideas tor worlting up a con-
vention and all pledge their support to
the proposition.

The Simpsonian comments very tav-
orably upon the proposition, saying
that it contains “many good ideas."
The Daily Iowan is also known to he in i

“ lover or the plan.
Cornell college says that “the Cornellv‘
ran heartily lovers the contereuce otl
Iowa journalists. The problems which
face the stat: of a school periodical
,could be greatly lessened in their 0v—
ershadowing importance it opportunity
[or obtaining the advice and experi-
ence at others could be had.” Editor
Kreger goes on to say that “the Cor-
nellian will be [ound to be present
when the roll is called" and pledges
that "ally assistance that may be needs
ed Iroin Mount Vernon will he willing.
1y given.”

Over at Toledo Editor Warner of
tho Leander Clark Record says that
“the above proposal of The Scarlet and
Black for a statewide conierenee at
college editors deserves the consider-
ation of every individual interested in
the publishing of the various college
papers throughout the state. For a

The Cornellian orl

nuuiher OI years the editors at colleg‘:

tion and a convention such fit; The
scarlet rind ldlticlt suggests would go :i
long hay toward securing it. The cone
ventioii would also serve as a training
lsoliool [or editors and business Inallr

ogei-s and set a new and higher sulllllr,

‘ard t'or college publications. The Rec-
ord stall is entirely in inpotliy with
ltlic movement and believes that deﬁle
‘lllte steps should be tolten to put the
plan into action."

l under the caption “Let’s Get Togeth-
‘er,“ Editors hattin and Tracy ot the
,Coc Cosmos pledge their earnest sup-
port to the plan. They say; "In a re—
:ceuL issue or The Scarlet and Black
the question ot‘ having a eontcrencc ot'
Iowa college editors some time during
jtlic next two months was proposed.
‘The Cosmos heartily seconds the 's. &

BJS’ proposal antl we believe with‘

ilheul that there are many hcnotits to
he derived from such a meeting. Dcl'lv
nitc arrangements as to place, the c. ,
‘penses ot the meeting, and other de-
tails can, of course, be arranged by
correspondence We are willing to do
our share."

Yes, and add to those comments the
root that one institution has already
lolicl'etl to furnish entertainment ior
Another has volunteered to get a good
program or speohcrs. A third ha IS‘
gestcd that it would bc glad to wire-
‘spond with the college iieii-spape - o -
er the state and get a seri - or tullts
iby Iowa editors mapped out. Others
istill, who have not discussed the idea‘
in their editorial colnmi , hzii e Voluue
tcered to do anything they could to
promote lIIe scheme.

50 that’s the way, the situation
stands. A convention is uniiersally
wanted. Why not get together and
have one? ‘

Now is the tune tor suggestions by
every editor We have several of our
own to oirer, but they may not he as
good as some others, One is that no
one institution be expected to shoulder
responsibility tor the whole thing, but
that the wn : he divided up and each
institution have a share in wor ng up
the tirst convention of college news-
paper men ever held in Iowa. Each
newspaper might to consider itselt as
one Of the founders at such a statewide
convention, Another proposal is that
a few or the most centrally located ed—
itors got together at once to select
temporary committees to carry out (lee
tails of the plan, to choose a date tor
the convention and a place [or it, A
third proposal is that each college
send in its ‘ideas and suggestions to
these committee- so that each institu-
tion would have its fullest voice in any
arrangements that might he made,
There are many other details to he
wot-lied out, but these seem to he
about the most important now.

this case did not semi to be conﬁned
to a tow individuals but seemed ilodl'ly
univeisal.

JllsL why were they disappointed-2
It could not have been he so or poor
noting, because what was presented
nos good a any which has been
seen here for same lime. IL was un-
usuiil, in toot, and ‘tstllL‘lllust be given
the \i iseoiism players Ior being inlelilr

it could not have been because the
plays were below stondoid, since they,
and Dal‘iiculﬂlly the one entitled "or
ange lilossom," have been upheld by
some oi the greatest dramatic critic.
in America as being some ot the host
attempts ever made in the United
states in writing [112»

People were disappointed because ot
nothing else but this: they wont to
the Colonial to hear one loud or a play
and heard another. They wanted a
,ploy that would entertain and ii , tend
they got the hind they had to siudy,

iiianosemont oi the troupe who ishoull‘
be scored tor not Iorworning thci
audience properly ot the kind at plot,
The t - ience needed to be educated up
to the hind or play. An introductory
speech by some nian betore each play,
telling or its leatiiies, ‘ts novelty and
its distinction, would have helped woii-
dcrlully in increasing the apt ecintioii
oi the audience. The “boom, pliiy
el‘s put on a presentation licic tlitit
was pooily managemrlhnt's all.

The Wisconsin players will have my
tlc eitcct on the coining of the Port-
niantoou players because the latter
will put on almost entirely comedy oi
the most cntertaining nature.

The Dramatic club has not been Grits
iciscd for its undertaking, but pl‘olialh
ly should be praised for the etiort it
has made so far in bringing the best
of drama to Gl‘lllllell. Next time it
will undoubtedly bring something that
will draw torth immediate applause.
