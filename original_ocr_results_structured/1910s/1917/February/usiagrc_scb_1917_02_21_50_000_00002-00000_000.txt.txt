“"119“ 3,000 spectators at the AllJBS‘
lowa game at Ames last Friday night
stood up and yelled t’or \lctul'y at the
beginning or the second half, the los-
ing Allies quintet came back with a
rush that fairly hewrldercd the Hawk-
eycs, and shot in basket after has
ket.

It may be too much to say that the
cheering ol the Ames crowd won that
game. But it is certain that the over-
whelming score was due largely to the
pep infused into the men by the spirit
of the spectators.

The same thing was even more eyie
dent at the Gl'iunellsCoe game here
week before last. it was not until thc
crimson and gold had a one-point lead
that the spirit of the crowd asserted
itself. During the first halt the team
play (1 almost a listless game; the
crowd was indifferent. But with the
Cedar Rapids men in the lead and the
outcome of the game in doubt, the
Grinuell cmwd began to encourage the
team. They demanded victor . They
got it!

The most important home game of
the , season comes Friday. Grinnell
has an even chance to defeat her old»
est rival, The scarlet quintet wul
play their scrappiest game. If the
fighting G 'nnell spirit exer - itself,
if the fans are not listless, it they the
mand Victory, there Wlll be no doubt
of the outcome.

Beat Iowa!

JOURKALISJI AND AUTHORSHIP.

W. W. Ellswol'Lh, a former editor of
the Century Magav'ne, discussed col-
lege journalism as a step toward an-
thorslnp, at Indiana University recent»
ly. He spoke of the large number oi
men who had been lcd into authorship
through their work on newspapers,
but then sounded a note of warning
that is worthy of the attention of any
serious student who has an ambition
toward literary work.

“The writing of books is a thing
apart from the writing of that which
is read only on the day it is written.
Stevenson has a good word to say on
the subject. It was twentyslive years
ago that Richard Harding Dayis, a
young l'eportel‘, wrote to Stevenson on
his own hehali and that or his lellow—
workers on the Philadelphia Press, to
express appreciation of the short story.
‘A Lodging for the Night,’ and adlnlra-
iion for ‘the brave sick mall’ fighting

pleasant that all you young fellows

Extensire changes in entrance r
ouii-ements and in the ruling dealing
wrtb the studies required tor the arts
degree are being made by the college
faculty and will be announced soon.

it is probable that the bachelor or
science degree will be abolished, and
in its place an arts degree with science
as a major will be substituted.

Another plan which is under can—
sideraiion is the changing of the limo
guage requirement at twenty hours.

grade, so that either ancient or mud-

it possible for a student to major and
minor in any subject in the curi-icub
uin without being required to study
Greek or Latin as is now the ease.

Entrance requirements will also be
changed so that a student umy enter

In this way it is hoped that there will
be greater cooperation between the
college and the high schools, and that
those students who have not had an
opportunity to study certain subjects
will not be handicapped too severely
when they enter Gi‘tuneli.
