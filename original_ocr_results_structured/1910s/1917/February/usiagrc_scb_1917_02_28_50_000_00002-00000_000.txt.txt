AT Mi\RSIIl\LLTO\

Recognizing the demands or report-
ers and other news writers in Iowa
colleges, the few men who met at Man
shallto -n last Monday night decided
to make the Iowa College Press con—
vention include more than just the
editors themselves Anyone who is
interested in college newspaper work
is invited to attend. [—1.9 or she may be

editor, or a cartoonist. The program

and her students and alumni have
much to be proud of, but there is much
lacking on our wide campus which is
to he lound at other colleges. There
can be little continuity or opinion or
tradition where there is continual and
rapid expansion. We have one thing
but lack the other. It Grillnell can
gain the new and still retain her hold
’npon the old, she will be peculiarly
ifortunate."

THOSE Pill 13 .\S.

Once more Grillllell bows to those
who have excelled. Once more she
stoops to those who have conquered
Once more she admires those who have
shown perseverance, endeavor and
ability.

And why have they snccccded and
surpassed Others? It seems to us tiiat
this year more than any other the Phi
[Beta Kappa students have been those

for choosing their lines of endeavor,
They have not taken everything that
has come to them, out instead have
made a wise selection and have persee
vered in their chosen fields.

Therein lies the secret to any suc-
cess.

 

QUEER IDEAS.

1 President Main voiced an interest:
ling opinion recently when he said,
“Some people have a queer idea of
college." We agree with him. Smile
people take college as a first resort,
some as a last resort, and others talto

it as a pleasure resort.

nor was it intended that the low in-

stitutiohs which took part in the meet— ,

ing Monday night should he the only
ones to take part in the convention.
They were called together as being
the closest to a common place of
meeting, and because they could he
gathered together in a hurry. The
work which these t‘ew men did the
other night is not important. The imr
poi-taut work will come when the big
convention is held. Then a permanent
organization is to be formed. Then a
real monument in college journalism
is to be erected. Then is when every
college newspaper mah in the state
should want to be present and collsl'dr
er himself as one of the founders of

an Iowa College Press association or

some similarly named body. ‘

Each college newspaper man in the
state will probably be asked in the
near future to do some one thing as
his part in establishing one of the
most important steps in college julll‘n»

state convention.

GR ELL GROWTH.

Editor Pride in the Iowa state Slur
dent: "To dance or not to dance is
thc big question at Grihnell just now.
The ti t Iowa college is last out-
growing‘its academic enrollment and
pmblems. As long as Grinneli had
only a hundred or two students the

“familyJife” social functions offered.

ample diversion and opportunity to ace
quire an ease in society. With an en-
rollment fast approaching a thousand
the problems are different and the old
order of social recreation is no longer
suliicient.

"The lircaliing of a tradition at as
old a school as Grinnell is no easy
matter and sentiment is running high
on both sides at the question. Some
change is neccssary to all growth and
with no change there can be little
growth. Therefore it is not surprising
that there is more or less uncasinr s
and restlessness among tlic students
and faculty at Grinnell; for Grinncll
is growing.

“The tact that cond' 'rms and senti-
ment are changing at Gr hell is not
so much a matter or anxiety as the
possibility that the old school may lose
in its trans on period some at those
remarkable qualities which have placV
on it and its graduates in a class by
themselves for so long. Fortnnetc in»
deed will Grinnell be if she can grow
healthily and normally without being
entirely possessed by the spirit 01' ex-
pansion as we are at Iowa State.
