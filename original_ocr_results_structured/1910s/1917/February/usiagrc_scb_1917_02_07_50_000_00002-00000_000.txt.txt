It the United States should go [0
war with Gerlnztnyiwldnt then-l lt
college men should be called into the
lield at some tnture dateillleu what?
One thing would be evident, namely,
that they uoiild show a decided need
ior some previous military training.

Whether or not college men believe
in war, whether or not they believe in
some world peace coutedei-ation,
whether or not they really believe in
military training—in spite ot these
beliets or disheliets there has come a
situation at present which threatens
not only the lite ot every male citizen'
but the very welfare of eveiy person
in the United states. It is a grave
situation, and woe be unto him who is
not prepared to meet it!

It is not tor us to judge noiv wheth-
ei- an entrance into war is right or
wrong. We are part or a social order;
of people, are but one or millions of
units comprising a whole body, and
we are in duty bound to the whole
group. If, as a consequence, the gov
eiiiment decides tor war, we must supr
poit the government, otherwise there
would be nothing but destruction The
thought has been well expressed by
Pl'ofcssul' Ropes, who said “Our (01>
tune, our life, the whore or this na-
tioii, oi this college and or this came,
miinity, depends upon . the course
which nleii's thoughts take in wash
ington this morning." .

So with the situation not to be qucs-
tioned, nc mu. admit that the liberty
and security oi Ameiican citi us can
only be guaranteed by being prepared.
The government has already acted
along preparedness lines. it has seia
ed vessels, it has guardctl navy yards,
and it has censored military news.
Will the college man do as the goverm
ment.7prepal‘e himselt for possible
war, or ball he enter the contest for
litc without knowing well enough the
game his opponent plays?

College men are built to be leaders
in the business oi war as well as tor
any other business. Their youth, their
strength, their vivacity, their determi-
nation, their iearlessuess all these
tit them tor the responsibilities of load
ip. Dill. they need more than these
characteristics. Tllny must have actu-
al training in the art or wariare. Not
until they tool that they are moie ci-
tieient than their opponent at his own
game will they have the continence
necessary to true leadership. Noi one
til they have a competent knowledge
at wariai-o will the nation he iustiticd
in depending upon them.

The chance being taken by im—
pi-opaicd collcgo men, who are to be
the haeklione ot a ilzttioll's inilitaiy
power, is a tremciidci- one. it is
about the greatest risk which any
country might take. Consequently, no
stop could be more the product oi
wisdom than to meet a system oi mil
itary training or education into Ameri-
can college

A DEUIDLI) CHANGE.
Due to some reason or other there

lids been it decided change wltllin the
past two weeks in the activities ol the

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

management ot the Y. M . A. Lecture
Course. For the l’nllilcr lcctnrc next
Saturday night advci sing has been
put out scicral day sooner than he—
tore. The management has gone to
the espouse ol' tiiruishing the press
with cuts oi the speaker. An cxpcrr
ciieed publicity man has been secured
and all publicity work placed in his
hands. Then, too, the management
has endeavored to sell extia seats to
town people so that there will be a
larger tund ior bringing good men to
Gl‘lnnell. in short, there has been a
iiinch accelerated activity lately on the
part of those who have had the Lee»
_tiiro Course in charge. We are glad to
see these changes, tor we teel that
they are going to help to satisiy those
whose money the management is
spending.

SAYS HOSPITAL IS NEEDED.

'l'he nced tor a detention hospital in
Grinuell is emphasized once more by
A. C. Stowe in a recent issue of thc
Grinncll Register. He asks the ques-
tions:

"“lly is it that we do not have local
facili es to care for the many tubercu-
lztr citizens who are dcpeudent upon
us for care?

“Why is it that we do not have a
properly equipped detention hospital.
but must continually expose to conta-
gious disease our children and young

people as well as the older ones, and‘

then permit this slaughter to contin-
ue‘i“

No American correspondent has been

Frederick Palmer is the author ot
numerous books dealing with war sub-
