gium, publi st and author, will be
the Commencement. speaker here on
June 13, according to an announce-
ment made by the college omce, His
appearance in Grinncll at that time
will be of particular consequence, bc-
causc of his interest in and authority
upon international questions,

May Discuss Belgium.

Mr. Marburg was minister to Eel-
gium in 1912-13, and his stories or
that country should greatly interest
a Grinnell audience. He is also pre 7
dent of the American Society for Ju
cial Settlement of International D
putes, and was one of the organizers
of the League to Enforce Peace, serv-
ing as chairman of the committee in
the foreign organization of that
league, He also served as Chairman

'0! the executive committee of the
American Peace Congress in 1911.

In Many Societies.

Mr. Marburg is honorary president
oi the Maryland Peace Society, and a
member of the American Economic
Association, American Political Sci»
euce Association, American Society of
international Law, as well as presi-
dent of the Municipal Art Society in
Baltimore. and a trustee of Johns
Hopkins University.

As.a writer on judicial and inter—
national problems, Mr. Msrburg is
well known. His Books include “The
Peace Movement practical," "Philos—
ophy of the Third American Peace
Congress,” and "Salient Thoughts on
Judicial Settlement."

From slime Unlvcrslty.

Both Theodore Marhnrg and Presi-
dent Main are g dnates from Job
Hopkins University. After tak g h
degree from there in 188i, M Ma -
burg studied at Orlord University in
'92 and '93, at the Ecolc Libi'e de la
Science Polititlue in Paris during the
years 1893 and 1395, and at the Uni-
versity oi Heidelburg (luring the sum.
mer sessions of 1901-3.

Grihnell College deems itself very
fortunate in having Theodore Mai-burg
as the Commencement speaker this
year, because of his authority and in-
ﬁllence upon the inter-national prob—i
lems of today. Although his subicctI
has not yet been announced, he willi
probably speak on some phase on that
national arbitration question.

Mrs. H. C. llallius Tells of Girls‘

Men Left in Collcgwﬂo
Class of 1866.

Hall a century ago Grinnell's
women were “scraping barrels of lint
and making bandages for the sol-
diers," said Mrs. R. C. Haines, class of
'55, in an interview with a Scarlet
and Black reporter. She said that in
her class only three of the fifteen men
were left to graduate, the other twelve
having joined the Union army. Prace
ticztlly no men remained in College,
and in 1866 there we sno graduating
class.

That the number who left was
larger, in proportion to the size of the
school, than the number who are
leaving now, was the impression of
Mrs, Main

‘ Red Cross work had not yet bccn

‘ wrgauized, nor wireless telegraphy in-
vented, so the college girls 'rollcd
bandages and scraped lint instead of
studying First Aid and the wireless
Code.

The influence of the war on later
classes may be seen in these two
statements in a catalogue of Iowa
College, published alter the war:

Mr, James, who now lives at 827

the women graduates from the Cole

Grinncll was transported to sunny
Greece when “A Spring Festival to
Artemis” was presented by the
Women's Physical Education Depart-
ment at Rand Gymnasium this alter-A
noon. In dancing, in costuming and

in coloring the pageant has not been
surpassed by anything of the kind
ever given in Grinhell. The work of
Miss Anderson in putting on this spec-
tacle cannot be too highly praised.

As the unfavorable weather of the
past week has made it impb. ible for
the pageant to be given on the South
Campus, it Was presented in Rand
Gymnasium for the beneﬁt of those
who cannot see it all the Campus at
a later time.

Brilliant. Proocssiounl.

The pl‘ocessional, led by the Girls’
Glee Club, included all the dancers in
the pageant and was characterized by
brilliant coloring and beauty of cos-
tumes. The purple robes of the
Priestess and her attendants, the Gre—
cian costumes of the Vase heal rs and
garland dancers, and the effective c
times of Fall's followers were part -
ularly attractive.

The Pipes of Pan was probably the
most popular of the many excellent
dances, the six girls in it presenting
the dance with great animation and
vivacity. The dithcult dance of the
Greek games was excellently pre-
sented by ten girls who suggested by
their dance movements the elements
of the Olympic games: throwing the
discus and javelih, the battle and
archery,

l-lelen Richter as Psyche in the in-
tei'pl‘elatlou dance presenting the urea
matio episode or her search [or Eros
was a beautiful and graceful dancer.
Mildreh Wilson, as Selene, the Moon
Goddess, took the part admirably.
The part or the priestess to Artemis
was ably taken by Sarah Kelley.

Group dances that proved especially
attractive because of the orchestral
accompaniment were those of the
spring maidens and the garland
dancers. The dance of the Hunt-
resscs, of the Pompcian [lower girls
and of the Greek maidens were also
very well done. The entire pageant
was a beautiful representation of a
Greek testlval. The proceeds of the
entertainment will go to the funds for
the Red Cross.
