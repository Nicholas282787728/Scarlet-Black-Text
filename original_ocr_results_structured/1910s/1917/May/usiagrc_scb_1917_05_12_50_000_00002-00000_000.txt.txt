HOW THEY COME TOGETHER.
When the phrase "world peace" was
mentioned some tour or ﬁve years ago
by anyone we would almost uni-
rersttlly experience the same feeling
that it “sounds nice, but it isn’t hu-
man nature for nations to quit fight-

bl: to ma Burma-

and communication.

mg}.
. ow, however, it is dllicl'euf. Never

in the history or the world has world
peace seemed a surer thing than at
present. If existing movements work
out, all nations will he without exten—
sive armaments and devoting them—
selies to peacctul ctiﬂeztror all within
the short space ot nve . ars troin now.

some oi these movements are res
inarltahle. For instance, the spectacle
of twelve nations, one oi them the
great British Empire and all compris-
ing most or the world, tghtmg against
a common too would have scorned a
dream some time ago. But now there
are more than twelve it we include
China, Chile, Spain and others which
are with the Allies at least in spirit,
And what could he more indueivc to
world uniﬁcation than for nations to
ﬁght side hy side against a common
enemy? ‘

The world is also coming to liavc a
common ohiect. “World peace and
Democracy” seem to he the slogan ot
the day. It was tor the avowed at—
tainment of these that the United
States, Brazil Cuha and Panama en-
tered tlic war. And whatever may
have prompted England, France and
Ros is to have declared war, their
wishes now for world peace and
democracy cannot he questioned. Eng
land cvcn has 'proposed a plan for
world peace through tormer Anihas—
sador Bryce, and the new pro sional
government or Russia has announced
this as its oliiect in continuing the
war

it c i cars ago we may have thought
it “human nature tor nations to ﬁght,"
out we are now ﬁnding the horrors or
this war heing driven to every home
in the world. melting every individual
sick at heart. and covering the world

Eaton, Cram (£9. Pi

with a cloud ot sadness. And now we
are seeing that it is “human nature
Ior iiations to want purer."

World peace was hooted down rivc
years ago as a mere theory; yct within
the past month we liavc seen nations
get together in common conferences to
work out common plans. This has
linen done iulornially and without the
medium or any world congress, And
if progress can he made in this un-
organ d anti more dilhcult way,
there is no reason why the world con-
gress or a world peace plan could not
he just as practical.

Yes, some of these movements are
unifying nations, others are showing
that it is human nature to want peace
instead of war, and others are proving
that world peace is practical. They
are reinarltahlc movements. They are
sure to bring world peace.

Men will he allowed to use the g
tennis courts at any time or the day

M s Anderson says that the men may
use the court on Friday atternoon bee
cause the girls are for the most part
