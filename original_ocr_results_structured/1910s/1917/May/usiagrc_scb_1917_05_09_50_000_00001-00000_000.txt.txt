with the uncommon spectacle in
Crinuell of a Minneapolis Symphony
Orchestra standing up to play “The
Star Spangled Banner," and with a
patriotic audience that ﬁlled Herrick
Chapel to overﬂowing rising to sing
the \Vm'ds of the piece, another May
Festival was ended last Monday night.

The Festival this year, the sevens
teenth one, was a huge success. From
the ﬁrst concert last Saturday night,
when the Girls' Glee Club scored a
popular success in their annual home
appearance until the end of Monday
night’s program Grlunell musicians
were treated to a menu of musical de-
lights of the highest standard.

Girls’ Club Opens Festlvnl.

The three days of music were
opened by the Girls' Glee Club in con-
cert Saturday night, and there are
probably few people who would hesi-
tate to say that it was one of the
most popular concerts a Crinnell
Girls’ elnb ever gave. It was also
one of the best. Others in the past
have been heavier, often too much so,
and maybe that is one reason why this
year's appearance was .so generally
appreciated. It was heavy enough to
have a high standard, but not so much
so as to tax the musical ciiorts oi the
club beyond their limits.

Many Enenrcs Sung.

, A wealth oi acceptable songs was
rendered. It would be hard to pick
any one as a favorite, Probably
Beach's ”The Year's at the Sp mg"
was one of the best of the more difﬁ-
cult numbers and as encores several
old favorites, such as "Tick Took,"
Bowl of Ruses," and even the much
over- 'orked ”Johnny Schmoker" drew
forth a hearty applause train the audi-
ence.

As soloists, Mi es Gladys Downing
and Grace Scary appeared. s
Downiug’s soprano voice was pi .
rented at its best when she sang two
most difficult solos, one of them an
encore, h Seal‘y will always be a
welcome violinist before Crinncil aud—
iences and her playing in the varied
parts of “Ballade and Polonaise" by
Vicuxtemps was one oi the best in
both technique and expression. Be-
sides thcse two, Misses Downing, it
nor, Chaney and Bean appeared in two
ouartct number . Theirs was one of
the best balanced quartets that has
ever sung in Crinnell.

Stunt Is Clever.

The feature of the whole concert
was the stunt which was as cleve as
it was oi'glnai. It consisted of "Math-
er GOOSE” characters who Sang “Moth.
er Coos ' songs, Eight oi the club
were dressed as Goose Girls, nine
more as different tlowers, and six of
them like riiifercnt characters in
Mother Goose rhymes. These latter-
came onto the stage one at a time and
sang solos. Gladys Downing as Meth—
er Goose, Alice Roosevelt as Little
Miss Muifct, Charlene Bean as Hump-
ty Dumpt Mae Beaver as Little Bo
Peep, Jes e Chaney as Littlc Robin
Redbreast and Jean Cattcll and Mile
dreti Granger as Jack and Jill all
made popular hits with their solos

Much credit is due Processor Fie e
for directing the club in i hearsais
and to Mrs. Pierce for her citic nt ace
companying during the concert,

A crowded chapel greeted the sec-
ond concert of the Festival on Sunday
afternoon whclr Robert Schumann's
“Paradise and the Perl" was sung by
the College Choir and ferry soloists.

Ruby Holder Is Soloist

Three of Llle soloists were from out
of town and the, fourth was Miss Home
er of the local school oi music facility.
The oratorin was (Iii cicd by Professor

Spaiiidiug Contests are not all orztc
tory, and or-ators are not the only
ones who participate. Little mice and

tertainment.

Two theater mice, tiring of the
dusty obscurity or the Colonial bases
merit and impelled either by the pi
verbial glare of the tootlights or by an
inherent craving for publicity. made
their theatrical debut before the sec
date audience which gathered in the
Colonial last night to enjoy the
siiaulding Contest.

While the first two speakers volu—
bly elaborated upon their patriotic
themes, these enthusiastic rodents
executed a series of aesthetic and in»
terpretotiv dances well calculated to
engage the attention of a most re-
served audience. The dances showed
lack of preparation, however, the
leading mouse lost the step and the
pair were forced to withdraw in dis-
grace.

No craving for publicity found lodg-
ing in the conventional spirit of the
local professor of psychology. Al-
though called upon twice to speak he
refused to disturb his. Spartan-rile
immobility. But then, the poet was
right, and “The best-laid plans of

The wrun'ng selection was an emo-

concluding w h a vision of the world-
wide peace of who future. This dill-l
cult oration was presented in a well
restrained style, characterized by ex—

In presenting the familiar “Plea ior
Cuba,” Tobin evmced the most effects

For the ﬁrst time since 1913, Grin-
nell will entertain the athletes of the
Iowa Conference at the Annual Con-
ference meet next Friday. Already
the alfair is shaping toward one of
the biggest meets which has been held
in the Conference, and ii the weather
is propitious, there is no doubt but
what it will be a decided success.

Nine schools will send representa-
tives to the meet, which means that
from 150 to god athletes will take part
As was the case last year, Morning-
sidc will not be here, as only Iowa
Conference schools are admitted, un—
less others are invited. The schools
which will take part in the meet are
Coe, Cornell, Highland Park. Simp-
son, Penns Des Moines, Iowa Wes-
leyan, Parsons and Grinnell.

There will be a number oi noted
athletes competing, among them being
Collins, Massey, Otis and Baxter of

and Hend ' on of Simpson, Gene and

Iowa Wesleyan. Ziegler and Flinspach
of Parsons, besides the members or
the local camp. who are no less iamous
than the invaders. ,

Two schools loom up as probable
winners of the meet, and they are Coe
and Crinriell. The victory which the
crimson and gold won over the strong
Carleton team last Saturday has not -
tended to make local inns more opti-
rnistic iii regard to Gl'iuncll‘s chances
of cupping honors. There is, as al-
ways, 9. possib ty of some “dark
horse" which can cut into the points
so heavily that neither oi the two
mentioned can pile up enough of a
lead to take a commanding situation,
