Glee Club Reunion.

The Girl ' Glee Club reunion will
be an especially interesting feature of
this year's commencement, A rc-
union concert will be given by the
club and its alumnae Tuesday '
iiig on the campus. A reunion picnic
is also planned for the same day.
Practically all of the hundred and ﬁf-
teen former members or the club are
expected to return.

The announcement of the coin-
mencement speaker, Theodore Mai--
burg, former minister to Belgium. has
occasioned no small interest. Because
of his experience in international at-
fairs and his intimate knowledge of
Belgium, his address is looked {err
ward to with unusual anticipation at
this time.

Vllrlety Promised.

The Class Dav exercises, With the
exception of the Dramatic Club play
at night, are in the hands of the 1917
class members themselves. It is rnr
mored that some variety may he added
to the usual order of events this year,
but no deﬁnite announcement has been
made. The Dramatic Club will pre-
sent "Prunella" in the evening.

ning reunions this ycar and are ex-
pected back in large numbers, espe-
cially for Alumni Day.

The class at 1917 will not present
quite as large numbers as the gradur
ating classes of rcccntyears, through
the absence of those men who have
enlisted in some form of war service.
For the most part, however, the
Senior men are remaining until after
Commencement.

BALLDT DN KENNEDY
MEDALS THURSDAY

Upperclissnieu to Determine the
Four Senior Men and Women
Who Have Been oil Greatest
Service to the College
Connnunity.

The ballot to decide what two
Senior men and two Senior women
will receive the W. .1. Kennedy med—
als for being of the most service to
the college community during their
four years, will be conducted to the
library by the student Council
tomorrow. All Juniors, Seniors, and
Faculty members are expected to

‘vote.

The fund for these Drlzes, whlch
yields $50.00 annually, was estab
lisbed by W. J. Kennedy, 01 Sioux
City, president of the Purity Serum
Company. Mr. Kennedy was (or
fourteen years the head of the Ania
mal Husbandry Department at
Amos and became interested 'in
Grinnell through the knowledge
which he gained of Grinnell methr
ads while there.

Last year the medals were award-
ed only to the men ol the Senior
but after careful considera-
tton, the Student Council deelded
this year to grant a first and second
prize to both men and women.

These medals, which will be pre»
sented at the same time as the Phi
Beta Kappa diplomas are given out
during Commencement week, are
not awarded necessarily to the most
capable members or the
Class, but rather to those who have
used their ability to render the col-
lege the best service.

Fred Little won the gold medal
last year, whil‘e George Nelson and
Ervine Inglis were awarded second
and third prizes respectively.

“The man of supreme value at the
present time is the man who holds tip
our ideals and keeps them alott," was
the statement made in chapel this
morning by President Nash, or the
Paciﬁc School or Religion at Be eley,
Calif.

Iligh, Evans, Ciawtnrd and Muir ot
Hampton, Harp of Newton, smith of
Marslinlltown, and . illoi- or West
Waterloo.

The mcct is expcclcd to be it fast
and cl ‘ one in evci rcspcct, East
High i (lopt‘tl as n or, but as the

strength or many of the other schools
is comparatively an unknown quan—
tity, there is a good chance of an—

place Satin ay.

Taking six or ts out of ton on the

garnered 36 points and landed second

meet at Des lloincs last Saturday
Antes won the meet and permanent

Hoyt not only won his two custoa

ed the low hurdles in the record time
at 24 4-5 seconds. In the hundred
three of the four places went to
Grinnell and there would have been
a repetition or last week's stunt in
taking the ﬁrst three places but for
Wyland of Iowa who placed second,

Burden Wins 440.

Barden executed the 440 in a way
that delighted all that saw him. He
drew a place which was rather toward
the outside and started oft on a dead
sprint and had gained the lead short.-
ly aiter coming into the back stretch.
He never lost this lead, but rather
lengthened it until he crossed the line
in 50 3-5 seconds. Another feature of
this race to Gripnellians was the cape
turing of fourth by Van Dorn, who
ran the longer distances last year and
was not entered in the Conference
mcet.

Good Time In Relay.

The mile r. dy, doped m fay ~ 01'

and threerﬁfths of a second slower
than the state record 3:26 1-5. The
Grinnell men all but on a strong ﬁnish
each touching on ahead of his oppon~
out who one ach lap succeeded in ob-
taining a lead only to lose it on the
home stretch. In the half mile relay,
the Grinnell quartet did as they were
scheduled and took it with ease, Hoyt
having a clear ﬁeld before him when
he received the baton.

Tltlrtl In Mlle.

In the mile run in which the ﬁrst
two places went to Iowa State, Paul
McGreng‘ ran a heady race and pulled
a neat third for Gl'innell. The two
Amos runners tool: the lead early in
the race and lengthened it with each
lap, attempting to make it a dead
heat so that the race tor the third was
the most interesting part of it. The
time in this event was 4:37 375.

In the half mile, although the rec-
ord was not-broken, time was made
which has not licen bettercd tor many
years Johnson, at Des Monies, won
the event with a speedy ﬁnish in the
unusual time of 1:57 3-5. ’

Record In Pole Vault.

One record was broken beside the
lows, when Erwin oi Drake and
Wilkins or Ames tied for ﬁrst in the
pole vault at the height of 11 ft, 9m.
Ames placcd in every erent but two
and captured only two ﬁrsts.

The ﬁnal ranking or the colleges
