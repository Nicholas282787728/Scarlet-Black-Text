SOCIAL ADVANCE.

Several letters have conic to the etlr
ilor's desk recently from prominent
men ol er the state in which they ex—
press the hope that Grllmeil will not
sanction college dancing.

Gi-innell is not legalizing college
dancing in any way, At the same time
that she provides a proper atmosphere
for vacation innctions her [acuity has
stated that no student would he allow
ed to dance while college was iii ses-
sion.

The vacation dance is something
which no institution can prohibit ex-
cept in so tar as it concerns its own
college buildings. In Grinnell these
dances have heen public affairs which
were open to anyone which the inan-
a'gement cared to admit. Faculty chap-
ernn's have been present, but they have
had no actual authority over the thing.

Grinnell has decided that if college
students dance during vacation times
they should be placed in a proper at-
mosphcre, so dances are to he provid-
ed on the college campus. Students,
faculty and guests of the College are
to he the only ones admitted, It is a
big step in advancing the social stand—
ards in Grinnell.

THE PACIFIST.

Just hecanse the demand voiced by
a tew Griunell men at a mass meeting
last Monday night smacks or militar-
ism is no reason why the paciﬁst
should not support military training
in Grinnell.

No matter how much a man favors
peace and is against milimrism, he
should still support military training
as an educational advantage. There
are men here who cannot follow an—
othcr's orders and that is what so per
cent of the students will have to do us

, soon as they graduate. There are who
ers who cannot suffer the pain 01 a
few hard knocks. Others lack any
sense of precision. or system and of
organization problems. Thcsc railings,
entirely educational 'in nature and of
the utmost importance, would he rein,
edied by the addition of military train.
ing to Grlnnell liie. The pacilist
should support the proposition be-
cause of its educational value and for
the training it gives in citizenship.

THE FUTURE EDITOR.

The Highlander: "The proposal
coming from the editor of the Grin-
nell Scarlet and Black for u conven-
tion or the editors and business inan-
agers of the college papers of Iowa
for a helpful consideration of prolr
lcms of college publications is a good
one. However, it can be most cucct-
ive if next year editor and Immat-
gel were Selected before such it con-
vention in order that they might at:
tend.

“We suggest that these selections
be made soon and would further SHE?
gest that editor Bennett whose '
pel‘ience with his own staff in this
matter has been so satisfactory make
a proposal as to the time and place,

do the greatest amount or good to
those who all he in authority next
l'edr,"

liditor \l'lllizmls' suggestion is
good one. In cider that the convene
hon “will do the greatest amount or
good to those who shall be in authoiu
ity next year" is just the reason why
it has been decided to include report-
eis, future editors and all those inter—
ested in college journalism in the
nuinher who will attend, The High-
lander seems to think that only pres-
eut editors are expected to he present.
It this werc the case a state convene
tion would be nothing more than a
temporary altair.

So important did 'the central editors
think the shove idea when they
met that they decided to lay more than
particular emphasis upon getting the
future editor to come. He as well as
the present one should be trained if
the greatest good is to he done in Colo
lege journalism. VVithont training the
future newspaper man there can he lit-
tle continuit, and an Iowa college
press convention needs to he perpetu-
ated. So the conference which will
be held at Colfax on Iiareh 23 and 24
is being planned particularly tor the
future editor as well as for all report-
ers, cartoonists and other writers.
And We guarantee that if he comes he
will not go away without reeling well
repaid.
