Mis Dl'Mlex- First

The iii-st number will he given
on Octoher 27. Miss Ruth Draper,
a reader who has met with great
success, has hceu placed first in an
extort to arouse interest in the

heard Miss Draper when in Cams
hridge last year on the Harvard EX-
change, says or her- ‘As a rulcz
don’t lilic dramatic readings, hltl‘.
Miss Draper is unusual. She is not
am a literary or ‘st—slle has real
ahiliiv as an actor. MISS Draper's
r-catli as are character stretches and
are unusual in that she writes all
