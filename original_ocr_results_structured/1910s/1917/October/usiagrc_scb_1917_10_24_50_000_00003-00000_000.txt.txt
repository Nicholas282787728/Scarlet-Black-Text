‘Slie is a dr nat t, actress, sat‘ ,_
ist and a wise interpreter or the 0010*
trons ot the hirnian heart," The e
are the n which Agnes chplie
uses to ( , iilie Miss ltuth Draper,
who appears at the chapel next Sat-l
ul'dat) ereuiiig as tlte first number on
the lecture con 6,

tires. Draper gives o igiiial nlouml

cry and makeup to help her in her
presentation or her character
sketches, _

Although her appearances in iiuir
lie have. not hecn nurneroris. Miss
Draper is lJy no means a beginner.
She has he i ing her monologues
to private aridiei _es tor veral years
and can name among these the rig
and queen oi England, and the pros-
ident at this country.

Agnes Repplicr, who is well known
as a contributor to atlantie Monthly,
and as o wiitor on the subject or
women aiid the w i, says‘ “While
most ot Miss Diaper t. monologues are
hurnoious or atirio, they gr v at
times tense w h emotion, betraying
an exquisite and poignant pathos
which proves her to be a pastinis-
tress oi her art. While most ot them
are simple in construction, there are
others which may he said to coir
dense a llu‘eeract play into ten lircath-

less moments.”

day evening at 8 o'clock at which
time the readings will begin. This
assure to holders of the semester

“There are three things,“ said Dr.
E. A Steiner in h . tall: at 501mm
more prayer meeting last night “that,
I should like to remember If 1 were
a sophomore again. The ﬁl t is that
time does not pass. \\'c,zu‘e given a
loat of time and each day we cut ott
a 51‘ some day it Will all be gone.
The second is that every wrong act
brings its rctrilnltion. Your deceit
now will ﬁnd you out. And the third
is the [act of God. It. is this that
makes lite worth living these thus."
