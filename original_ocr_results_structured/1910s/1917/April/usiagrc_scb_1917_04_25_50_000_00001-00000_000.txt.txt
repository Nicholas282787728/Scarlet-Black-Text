Although they ran the half mile l'e—
lay under record time in the Drakc
Relay incet last Saturday, the Griir
iicll quartet of sprinters were iorced
to acknowledge deieat at the hands or
rather the teet oi the Wabash college
team ol Crawiordsville, Indiana, who
ﬁnished in 1:30 17 In the two mile
event Grinncll ion a sale third alter
a close race for the ﬁrst had been
lost on the last 150 yards or the third

. relay.

In the shorter race Bardcu started
for Grinncll and as nearly as can be
told touched oil’ with the leaders.
Fleming and Dairow succeeded in
keeping abreast at the best colleges
in this part or the country. but the
Indiana team gave their best man,
Sweet, a lead over thc Grinuell canr
tain which was too great to overcome.

_ Two-mile Illtel'esiillg‘.

The two mile event was leatured
by a pretty race in the ﬁrst relay in
which Sp nkle was barely nosed out
alter having escaped from a box sev»
eral times. He was timed in 2:02. J.
B. hchi-egor then took the baton and
ran the host race of his young career,
ﬁnishing strongly but two yards be:
hind the leader. Fleck. new to the
distance, took up the race, closed the
gap between hiinsell and the leader
quickly. and tore elf the ﬁrst lap in
about :56 or :57, making repeated at
tempts to gain the lead on the from.
stretch. However, he had set himself
too test a pace and hcgan to weaken
about 220 yards lrom the ﬁnish. while
Fleck, ﬁghting gainely, ﬁnished
slowly, the Morningside and Cornell
runners started off at a good speed,
so that when Paul ichi-egor took the
stick there was a gap or around ﬁlty
yards, which was too much to close
up on Cuiiy and Peck, his opponents.
Neve thcless lie held his third and the
gap did not widen.

Another Record.

Tile other collegc evcnl, the mile
relay, was also won by the Wabash
and they broke another recor 3:23
