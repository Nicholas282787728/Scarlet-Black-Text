B. d. GARNEY IS LIEUTENANT

To Take Exams.

From the number of Grinncll gradu-
ates and present students who have
already enlisted or are planning to
enlist in some branch of the federal
service it is a reasonable inference
that the college will be well represent
ed by men taking active part in the
fighting which seems to be inevitable.

Among the prominent Grinllcll grad
uates who have already responded to
the call is B. J. Carney, '12, who was
unanimously chosen first lieutenant of
Company D, First Iowa cavalry, at the
election held in the armory last even—
ing. Carney is one of the fifteen new
recruits who havc added their names
to the roll of the troop since the call
last week for the enlistment of this
company up to its full war quota.

“Doc” Little To Serve .is Oii‘icer.

Fred Little, who graduated last
June, is another Griimcll man who
will serve his country during the pres
ent crisis in the capacity of an offi—
cer. Little recently passed the federal
examinations successfully and obtain—
ed a commission as second lieutenant.
It is understood that he has taken his
commission with the declaration of
war between the United States and
'Germany.

a number of Grinncll students, in—
cluding Hugh Mitchell, '13, and Har-
old Wenner, ’19, and Willard 'Ray, a
graduate last spring, will go to Des
Moines within a week to take the pre—
liminary aviation. examinations. If
successful here they Wlll be taken to
Fort Collins, where after a rigorous
period oi training uney will take the
examinations for admittance to the
regular United states aviation corps
and will be sent to one of the five fed-
eral aviation training stations.

litany Will Sign Later.

A great many other men are only
prevented from enlisting now by the
desire to finish the college year. To
the seniors who will receive their de
grees at this time this influence acts
as a particularly strong cheek upon
the desire to enlist at once. When cul—
lege closes in June it is expected ﬂint
a large number of Grinnell men will
answer the call to the colors.

that effect has been going the rounds
on the campus for the past week, but
according to all authorities there is
little or no foundation for it.

the matter, Sco't Mac ,,elit~nii «hated
that he had heard nothing a t ",i
and it was his boliet that the Board of
Control would take no action. ‘

Little Reason For Abolislnnrnh

"Doc” Huff, director of athletics,
made a strong stand against such an
action. If the military training here
would be accompanied with sufficient
equipment and if it were a da' , drill,
there would be some reason for drop-
ping athletics in its favor, was his
opinion. However, as it is to be mere»
ly a two days' affair each week, he
thought that there was no reason for
discontinuing spring sports, as the ave
eragc man will have time enough for
both, if he wants to take them. It is
certain that Grinnell will take no such
action unle. the other colleges of the
stnte show similar intentions. "Doc"
said that the report that Drake would
drop athletics after the Relays was
fat. , as he had had a talk with John
Griffith, director of athletics at the
latter school, Monday morning, 'and
Griffith had told him that Drake would
not abolish spring sports unless the
example was set by a majority of the
schools of the state.

Woillll Keep‘ Out Athletes.

Shuilld Grinnell take such an action,
she will materially hurt her prospects
of getting high school athletes to come
here. This is one of the h'sgcst rea.
sons for continuing athletics in this,
as well as in other schools. There is
no telling what will be done with ath-
letics next fall, but all preparations
are being made just a, though there
will be no chance of their discontinue
ance.

Ila/.ardbd by Tile Scarlet and Black. if
such should be the case there will be
.a struggle between the Juniors an

that the results will be somewhat in
this proportion: Sonic 47: Sophoe
mores, 44; Ft slimeu, 2 and Seniors,
17.

The Junior hopes are based on the
winning of four events by the peel-less
Hoyt and the capping of one of tie
relays. The coming of Augustine this
morning will add several point.
Sprinkle, Miller, Osgood, Fleming,
Burns and Ross are tmstctl to make up
the balance of the furLy— 'x. The
Sophomores have two men who will
quarrel for second personal honors in
Bartlen and stock. These men, with
aid from Smith in the discus, did all
the scoring for the ’le-ei-s in the Home
Meet last year, and with such men to
help as Fleck, A, Miller, Johnson, Dare
row and “Tug" Miller will give the
third year men a close race. Bat-den
is undoubtedly the class of the college
in the quarter, stock looks good in the
hurdles and lumps, and Johnson and
A. Miller must be watched in the half.

THREE TEAMS WILL
BE SENT TD DRAKE

lii)‘ Cin'lli ill m. Drake in Two
chltsgcompcﬁtinn For
Places Very Keen.

With the Drake relays less than two
weeks away, the selection 01 the three
relay teams that will he sent is nar-
rowing down closer every day. This
will be greatly facilitated by the meet
of next Saturday. .

The three teams that will be entered
are the half-mile, the mile and the
two~mile relays. This means that four
220 men, fo r quarternuilers and four
half-miler will make the trip and at
present there

on out for every race.

Donsters speculate Du Tw [ilc 'I‘Hlm.

The two-mile team is the only one
about which there is much speculation
by the dopcsters. It is the first time
that Grinnell has entered this event
and as yet no star half-inilers have
appeared. All the distance runners
will try-out for this team, but the Mll-
lers and "Rabbit" Johnson seem to
have the edge. it is unquestioned that
“Mike” Augustine will have a berth on
this team. others who are eligible for
this are Paul and J. B. McGrcgor,
Fleming, Sprinkle, and H. Van Doria.

The short relay team, which won at
the Carnival last year, can remain in-
tact this yenr. but the prospects are
that Darrow will replace Fleming with
Hoyt, Burden and H. Young as the
other three men. Forecasts must also
figure Frank Burns in this race.

“'nlllisll Tonm Entered.

In the mile relay only two places
seam assured. Those are Bal'dcn’s and
"Mike's," but the position of the events
may influence these. The other two
places are a tosseup between Fleck,
Fleming, and John Miller. Fleck and
Fleming were both on the mile relay
team which went to the lllinois Indoor
meet. “Chuck” Hoyt, who was also a
member of tbi, team, is not expected
to run the dual again. The mile re-
lay team at mine , took a close sec-
ond to the Wabash team which is also
entered at Drake. Although the Wa-
hasli quartet made good time, 3:35, the
cllztlige in the personnel of Grilmell's
tofu): may turn the tables.

Drake has given out no further in»
formation which furnishes any other
dope on these three events. The spe-
cial event this year will probably be
the lZDryartl high hurdle race. It is
not expected that Griuncll will have
an entrant in this event,

nearly twice this many.

but in any case, some valuable the-

Camps Culldtl Off.

McAlmon explained the need of mil-
itary training, saying that it was see
rious business, and of greater import-
ance than ever since the government
training camps had been called off, so
that the only method short of enlist-
ment to obtain the drill is through
this company.

Dr. Spraguc said that he had spent
a large part of the spring vacation in
examining the systems used in other
schools and had formed many plaus
which could not he realized because
of our inability to secure equipment ‘
from the government. as it was at first
supposed we could. The plan which
will be used is that which was parti-
ally cvplained in the last i ire of The

drill on Wednesday afternoons for one
hour, beginning at 1:30 o'clock, a class
