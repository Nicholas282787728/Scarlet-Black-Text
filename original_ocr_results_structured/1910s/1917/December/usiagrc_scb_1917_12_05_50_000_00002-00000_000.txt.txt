A SERVICE FLAG

A service dag would he an elie‘ctivc
tribute to the Grinnell men who have
leit their college work or their busie
ness to do their part for America in
the great wa .

A monster ﬂag on the’eampus with
a star tor every Griunellian in the
survlce would be a constant and vts—
inle expression or our loyalty to our
classmates and alumni who are in
France or at training camps.

Such a dag would boa simple
thing in itself. But. it would show
the bigness of Grinnell-s part in the
war. It would help us who are here
to realize that our college is already
well represented “at the trout,” It
would help us to realize our debt to
these men, and to realize that we
have serious business here in college,

The college has agreed to ﬁnance
such a dag and the college Red Cross
auxiliary will probably be willing to
make it.

it seems most ﬁtting that Grinnell
women make the dag. In that way it
will truly be a (irimiell service dog.
There should he no delay in the work.

0 YOU. GILDRLLL
(From The Cornellian.)

Once more Cornell has met defeat
ai the hands of her most respected
rival. Saturday's game was as hard
a scrap as we have witnessed this
year, and yet there was less penaliz-
ing, less roughing and loss hitter ane
'tagonism than appeared in any game
which . the purple has played this
year.

Grinuell, we admire your team, we
admire your men.

"Here is a pledge to your health, to
your joy. your success,

For the tolk of your kind are few.
There is something to heal-ten, to

gladdcn, and hless,

In a bunch of good fellows like

You."

lillu . loll
(From The Daily Illini.)

Back in the days of Grecian su-
premacy men sat under the trees. on
the plazas and under the towering
arches or the Agoi-a and listened to
the wisdom ul great teachers. Men
gathered (or love of knowledge, for
love of higher education, (or the pure
love of learning thing they did not
know. The universities at old were
sacred thingsisacl‘ed to the thoughts
and arts 0! high civilization. Then
tllci‘c was no need for coercing men
with a plea [or spirit. Their spirit
was the love of their Workilhe love
of learning for lcarning‘s sake. That
was 1500 years ago.

Today, with our highly developed
civilization, our marvels of science,
0l|i careful and specialized branches
or education, we sometimes stop to
wonder what it is all for. Is the
diel'agc college student studying for
love of education, from pure desire
foi knowledge? Unfortunately educa-
tion seems to be makingalesing Ilghl.
Education is no longer directed toward
the development of men's minds that
they may call themselves well edu—
cated. It is directed toward that per
[action of an efficient mind which
shrill earn for the educated one not
more intellectual satisfaction but more
dollars. Everything is dollars, dol-
laie, dollars. People educate them-
selves to make more dollars and then
send their children to follow in their-
footsteps—that they may make more
dollars,

What does success in the university
0) the college mean? Does it mean
whether a mini has accepted knowL
edge, whether he can talk intelligent-
ly on sciences and philosophy and 1in
mature and language? No. success is
measured by popularity, by office
holding, by activities. If a man he»
longs to a dozen organizations, is

active in politics. is a social lion and’

is known as a good fellow, he is ac~
counted a success. He may have at-
tained his goal, but that goal has been
a mercenary, pleasure-loving goal
rather than the goal of true educa-
tion.

We work to pass a coursei‘nbi to
learn what is in the tour c. Whether-
our minds absorb anything or not is
immaterialilhe object is to pass the
course. Again we see the mercenary
end. We think a college diploma may
get us a better Job, may introduce us
to better society which will bring
worldly prominence. Self-centered mo-
Lli‘esiall. The old days have passed
before our time, Now we are hounded
with the cry of eificiency. There is
no and beyond it. The material end
is the end sought. Men’s minds are
no longer storehouses of knowledge:
they are machines ror coining money.
So drink a toast to the departed
knowledge—to an education greater-
than the sordid conceptions of men's
minds today. The age of true linowL
edge has gone. In its place we ﬁnd
the rasping call of grades, a college
diploma. ediciency, money and alli
tor what?

Boys under 21 have been mama to
continuc their cdiicotion, that the class
of educated men may not be dimine
ished in a future decade. Let us be
sensible about the thing. The work
lies at each man‘s hand to he done7
the one for the rillc, the other for the
book. it should be done as allotted.

Only let those who are drafted to
remain remember this: As those who
SCI‘\e on the battleﬁeld or in the ﬂeet
will do their work taithfully and well
to their utmost, so they who serve in
keeping alive our heritage of knowL
edge must do their work [aithfully
and well. They are stewards to serve
in place of the have young men who
have gone. From that responsibility,
lrom that dralt, there is no exemption.

We Might as Well Tell You

that it is going to be more and more difficult to get GOOD
clothcs, except at much higher prices than now pre-

vail. The supply of good mas
terials is not beginning to
meet the demand.

Clothes that}: will always be,
of course. But good clothes
are going to cost more for sum:
years to coma,

Therefore, the best time to buy
is NOW---an extra suit or two
will prov: a mighty good in-
vestmcnt,

And their prices are reasonable.
