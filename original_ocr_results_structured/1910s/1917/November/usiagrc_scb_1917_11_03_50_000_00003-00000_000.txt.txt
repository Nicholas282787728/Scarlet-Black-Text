By 1;. c. Lee, '19.

Before I say something about my
impressions on grinncll on which
the editor has assigned to me to
write, 1 thinkit would be of inter»
est for my Grinuell iriends to
know something or my chance to
come and the reason or my having
come to criuoell.

The Nanhai School where l have
been tor about six years is the
pest school that ever existed in
China through the ability and
management of our own local Chin»
ese. Mr. William N. Tattle, I 12.
who taught there was liked very
much. My friendship with him was
most acceptable. In our talks Grin~
nell college was among the favor-
ite topics. 50 I began to realize
that it was just the sort of school
that i Wanted to enter if I might
secure an opportunity to come to
this land. With the encourage
meat or offering a scholarship to me
and the kind letters rroin .Mr Jaoua
I tried all my best to avai myself
to come’ totthis college. ' , .

Nu Servants ucre,

 

 

 

The first thing that I noticed
when 1 came is that the town is
entirely servantless. No home, so
far as I know. in this town keeps

 

lers on the tables during mealtimes

come just [or that mere service.
Much more remains to be done by
the mistress herself. This, to my
mind,, shows that the women in this
town [ulfill their womanhood, wife-
hood, and motherhood. They are
really active,

Not long alter I reached here, I
inquired about the organization or
the city government. Much to my
surprise, it is a very simple one. At
iirst I thought the people must he
not to he lawless. They are not
lawless but law is useless. The selfr

control in the individual counts for

the wellrbeing of the town.
Inspiring Vesper Service.

The Sunday Vesper service in the

college chappel represents a purely
religious and

which gives me the real meaning of
spi tual lite—brightens my soul. I
fail to express what I want to say

as my English vocabulary is small ’

and inadequate. i can only assert
that the harmonious music, the well-
versed songs,‘ together with the
gentle voice and instructive words
mm the person in the pulpit ren-
der the service second to none
among those which I have ever at
tended myl
