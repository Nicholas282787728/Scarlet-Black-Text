Old Gi-innell," with a sp it which was
a tribute to the sons who gave their-
lives in the service of the country.

Prob Noble Roads Itoll of Horror.

In reading the roll of honor, Protes-
sor Noble spoke of. the four men who
were killed in action, but stated that
those who died of disease in this coun-
try had made just as great a sacriﬁce
and given just as full a measure or de—
votion to their country as those who
gave their lives on foreign SOll. Taps,
which was blown after the reading of
the honor roll, lormcd one of .the
most impressive’parts of the service,

The Comrade Song, by the Men’s
Glee Club,/was especially appropriate
and impressive.

Honorable William D. Evans, justice

, of the supreme court or the state of
Iowa, opened the commemoration zde
dress by citing an instance when he

grad made the stabement that the

IGrand Anny could never have new re-
cruits and that they were doomed to
become a memory. ”1 said this be-
cause wiser men than I had said it and
because I really felt that there could
never he another war," he declared.
“Those of us who made this statement
haveiiyed to realize that our dreams
of peace were unfounded and that the
alarmists who threatened war were
correct"

Evans Gives Tribute to Women.

Judge Evans olfel ed a tribute to the
women of the war and spoke at lcngtb
concerning Miss Maude Andrews of
the class or 1910, whom he had known
since her infancy. ”I have never beg
tore seen the name of a woman on
Inch an honor roll," he said. The
sacriﬁce or this brave GriImell girl
is an example of the courage and the
enthusiasm with which the women of
the whole world did their part in the

‘i’ll'.

“There are two armies in every war,
the army or victory and the army of
sacrifice. We know when the boys
march away that some of them will be
uhosen to become members or the lat-
ter army.’ Some think that the mem-
bers of this army sacriﬁce and receive
nothing. But on the contrary there are
great rewards tor these in the world
to come.

“These men are living in another-
world. It is ier us to attempt to main—
tain the high standard of courage and
justice which these Grinncllians have
set, even to the point cl making the
great sacriﬁce of death ourselves if
necessary.”

Giant Bass Furnishes
Sensation At Nyanza

Flop! A giant black bass, sus-
pended at the end of a. flimsy liner
which, in turn, was attached to an or-
dinary bamboo pole, Crushed to the
ground on the shore of “Lake Nyanza"
last Tuesday evening. And with that
’Jplop”, a Grinnell nimrod tool: his
place alongside his fellow track stars
in the limelight of champions.

The catch is said to be the second
largest bass- of the season here. As
the champion fisherman stated in it
special interview granted a Scarlet and
Black newsman, "I swiped the pole.
an‘ the rest 0' the outﬁt cost me twenty
cents. It's cheappl-‘n steak. I just
didn't give that a ﬁsh a chance to get
his breath ” ‘

"Laid it on my bed after I got home
an made sixty cents chargill a dime a
look”, he added. Hugh Green Gray
veriﬁes the ﬁsh story, as does the bass
itself. The green in Ml'. Gray’s name
stands for envy. He ﬁshed too. But
the real Isaac Walton of the occasion
was "Cohen" Taylor.
