by ~omcone even more desperate than
Father Time. i

"It can’t be done,‘ , iunoled the oth-
or one, who hadn’t been anxious to
leave the port and w irt especially
cnia, ing the sprint, either.
the ﬁrst girl gave a or, of joy. “I
know what I'll do," said she; "I'll stay
at my grandfather's all night, They
illVe just around the corner," and with
that she spcd on.

She knocked frantically at the door
of the house, rang the bell and in a
few minutes had tho whole family up
to see it it was a ﬁre or a burglar. She
had no time, however, to explain. She
had a minute and a half to get to liod
maishe’d lose that hygiene point. The
other * went home alone, the grand
pared want hack to bed, the girl is
still working tor a hygiene point.

“I Read It And Forget
All About Sergeants”

The above quotation from a Grinnell soltiier shows
what pleasure is afforded him in reading The Scarlet and
Black. It makcsliimforgctthc disagiceable side ofsoldier-
ing.

It means as much to him as a letter twice a week,
and contains as much news of interest as you could write
in a doaen letters.

There are hundreds of Grinncll men in the service
who do not motive [lie Scarlet and Black. Many of
these were in Crinuoll last year, or at the beginning of
this year. SEE IF YOUR SOLDIER FRIENDS ARE
