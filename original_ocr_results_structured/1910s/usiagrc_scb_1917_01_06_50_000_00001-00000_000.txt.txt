N0 VIE EVER SCHEDULED
WITiI SIMPSON, SAYS I’ECK

“We have never had a game schcd-
uled with Simpson during lilo present
basketball season,“ said Professor
Pcck when asked yesterday morning
concerning the cancellation oi a date
with the Methodists as rcportcd ill the
Des Moines newspapers.

There has been considerable discus
sioii iii the newspapers over Grinncll's
cancellation of the Simpson game, and
substituting one with De oines Col»
lege instead. Prolessor Peck thinks
that there has been same mistake, he-
causc on account of inability to agree
on the dates the two institutions have
not been able to schcdulc a game yet,
although this will be done later in the
season. Consequently, Grinncll could
not have cancelled any, he states.
