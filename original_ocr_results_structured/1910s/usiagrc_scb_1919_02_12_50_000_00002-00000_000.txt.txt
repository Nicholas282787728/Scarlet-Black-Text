A MEMORIAL Gt\TE\\'AY.
If ever there -\t:ts a group of rnen

who proved themselves true Gl'lnllelrj

hair it wits that group for \\‘l|0m the
twellt one gold are floating
riice ting. Struck doivn in
action on the held of battle or in
camps by the plague of sickness tho.
swept over the earth, they proved
themselves true heroes in the face at
the'gr’t‘ttlest test that can collie to any
man. All died willingly (ol' the coun
try they loved, with no thought t'or
themselves, that that country and the
whole earth might be trccd from the
oppression of tyrrany.
Grinnell's banner and the principles
[al' which she stands have been carried
into the thickest of the ﬁghting, and

those very principle‘s have had a part,

in alloumg right to conquer over-
might Would it not be ﬁtting to erect
sonic soi- t or a permanent memorial to
these twenty-one men, that the
names might be immortalized to fur
turc generations of Grrnnelliansz Cer-
tainly nothing that we can do can in
the smallest measure help to repay the
debt we owe them, but we can by
small act such as the one just sug-
gested show to their families and to
the hundreds or Gr-innell men‘ and wo—
men who will follow us how deeply we
appreciate the services they have ran—
Llerrrl to their countl'yiand to Grin»
hell.

rob a memorial should be worthy
oi representing the true spirit of these
heroes. A gateway has been suggest—
ed at the southwest corner or the
campus, with sculptured groups on
either side, or even a sculptured group
alone in that vicinity. Nothing of the
hind exists on the Gl'ihlucll campus or
in any of its buildings. We are singu-
lar in that we have no such work of
art as exists on the campuses of many,
probably the iriaiority. of colleges and
universities in this country. The Noah
Webster statue on the Amherst cani—
pus has attracted “aliourwlde atten-
tion. Otllel colleges are lloted tor
thcir bcautifnl sculpture. Here is an
opportunity which, it accepted, will
serve a tworlold purpose, that of eulu»
gtztug our heroes and beautiiyiiig our-
college grounds,

\\'lly not accept it?

(From The Michigan Daily).

Here's a table.

Theicwas once a man who wanted
to help other peoplc, He had studied
his iclloiiiiicii and decided that Ser-
i-ice was the keystone or a happy life,
He said:

"I‘ll lust trait till a chance comes
along, and then I’ll do someone a
worth while kindness."

There was once a man who liked his
rellowmcn. He was glad to be alive.
He whistlcd atrocioiisly, always or:
kcyi But he had a cheerful grin, and
a happy word for everyone.

It be had a gloom or a gronch, he
took it away to some place where he
didn't . hot it on his associate. And
his brcthrcn said of him:

“He's the original little sunbeam,"

He’d never thought about service.

But lic served, every day.

'i'llE FlClilrE l’Uli’LlCi
During the past tllree weeks, there
has been a widespread feeling of di,

content among many students or Gl r i

llell. Whether this discontcirt i
without cause or foundation docs riot
cuter into this oi-gumcnt. Thc tact
that there has been this reeling oi ( s7
content.

it strident body is the most difficult
collection or human bcirigs to satisfy
that can exist. That colleges do Sues
coed in obtaining and keeping the re»
spcct of their students, in spite oi ads
iiiinisti-ativc blunders an it short-
sightcd policies, is ample evidence at
the inherent strength of such institu-
tions, .

Grlmlell's strength lies in the Grid
ncll spirit, More students, more
equipment, mere national or even his
ternational reputation is so much or-
namentation. Party strife, internal
ructions’ and small quarrels arc sim-
ply the growing pains of a mighty
poivcr. Grinncll is growing. Nothing
is more indicative of this fact than
that this very uni-est among the stur
dents e sts. When the time comes
that Grinnell' students are satisﬁed,
then the Grllmell spirit will be decad-
cut and the school a fossil institution

It is characteristic or students that
they are ungrateful. They are quick to
protcst, but slow to thank. The trus-
tees at‘ Grlmlell must not think that
because their cftorts on behalf of the
student body are not discu sod, it [01*
lows that those cfforts arc unnoticed
or unappreciatcd. but on the other
hand, thcy must not think that because
the unrest has been allayed, it is dead,
Progress must continue. The glorious
unrest of Gl'llluell studcrrts is a living
torce working towards that end.
