PROF. MATLACK is
STOREKEEPER NOW

Sells Smokes and Candy in “Y”
Hut—General Store Also Has
. Long Hours.

Don’t say the quarantine doesn’t do
anyone any good. Did you eier nor
ticc the crowd that iiitcsts the small
retail store west or the quadrangle?
They have had a turnover stock or or
day there since the quarantine re
strictiug college students 1mm going
down town iv s started. The store
has added to s line until now it is
offering everything [rom cakes to cig-
aiets tor sale and has now come under
the title of “general store."

More business is being done there
than in many rears, more even than
when the Hart s House was in Opera:
tioii and the proprietors were awal
mind at almost any hour of the night
liy the calls or hunger or the men who
lived at the Harris House. Now, they
don't even close until ten or later and
their new hosiness lasts till the doors
of the ouad are closed. The men
asked. “What is the use of selling

.sinokes when we can't get over to get

them?” Arrangements are being made
so that they can be bought at the bai-
l'aclis now.

Mr. Matlaek has also come to the
aid of the men. He is now it store
keeper and has become quite pi'oﬁcr
ieiit at remembering the prices or the
ditfeieiit “bars". He sold out coni-
plelely all his stock the ﬁrst day he
was in business at the “Y" but, but a
new supply is on hand every night
and it is necessary to place a sign on
the bulletin board: .

- “More candy tomorrow. NO ROUGH-
HOUSE!”
