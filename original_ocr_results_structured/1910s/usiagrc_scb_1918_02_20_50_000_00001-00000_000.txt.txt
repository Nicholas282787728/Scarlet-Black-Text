nell's 23—14 victory last Saturday over
the Coe basketball team at Cedar Rap»
ids,

Considering the fact that Grinnell
had just played the veteran Cornell
team the night before, the showing
was remarkable. Garner caged seve
eral long baskets, but most of the
points made by the scarlet men were
due to team play which carried the
ball the entire length of the door to
a point almost beneath the iron ring.

(209, on the other hand, played a
loose game, with the exception of a
few minutes at the beginning of the
second half when they kept the ball in
their own territory.

Doe Scores First

Due to the small ﬂoor. there was an
unusual amount of rough playing.
Only by a slashing drive were the
players able to carry the ball down the
court. Dribbling was an impossibil—
ity.

The first half had barely begun
when Coe scored on a free throw.
This lead lasted but a few seconds. for
Garner came thru with a neat basket

wards with another goal. At one time
during this period the Grinnell five
were leading 10—3, but iust at the close
of the half H. Kremers, of the Coe
team, threw a couple of long baskets
and Meyers continued his consistent
work at tree throws, At the close of
the ﬁrst period the score stood 12-11
with the locals on the long end.

Change Lineup

Crinnell took the door at the be
ginning of the second half with a
changed lineup. Wassenaar substir
tuted for Augustine and Daubenberger
abdicated the pivot position in favor
of “Mike.” it took some time for the
shifted Grinnell lineup to get its beal‘r
ings, but the change brought the de-
sired results. A couple of long shots
by Garner and one by Somers at this
point of the contest put the game on
ice. In this period the Coe quintet
were unable to score a single ﬁeld
goal. H. Kremers at guard and the
accurate tree throwing of Meyers were
the outstanding factors in Coe's play.

GIVILIZATNIN MUST
BE MADE MODERN 0R
WAR BJEVITABLE

Is Statement Made by Maseﬁeld
in Lecture on on War Here
on Saturday Night

ENGLAND’S PART IN WAR IS
UPHELD AGAINST GERMANY

Now Hold One-Third, of Western
Front—English Women
Do Their Part

"If the states of the world are not
remodeled more in accordance with
man‘s inventions, and if submarines
and aeroplanes continue to develop as
rapidly during the next thirty year-s
as they have in the last four, one In.-
tion will be able to turn off the life of
another nation as completely as we
turn off water, and civilization will
become a myth."

This was the declaration of John
Maseneld, the English poet, author
and soldier during his address at the
Congregational church last Saturday
evening. as the last number on the
191L122 college lecture course.

Neetl Model-n Soclnl Structure

"As long as there is evil in the
world, and human nature is as it is.
the evil man will inevitably grasp the
right man by the throat," be stated.
“The nations of the world must mode
ernize their social structure, and in
that process curb the power of evil
nations to wage war, or we will come
to a time when the barbarian, perfects
ing his machinery of war through a
generation, 'will destroy whole nae
tlons."

“There are many influences which
make it difficult to abolish war,
Among these are the irresponsible
autocrat, the youthful adventurer, the
sedentary man who loves to read about
war and thinks it exciting, and the
cant which is preached. about the
beauty of war."

German Lies Refutetl

“Even if Germany multiplies her
submar es by three, and if they be
come twice as successful as they are
today, her chance of slal'vmg out the
entente is gone forever." This was in
reply to a lie which Germany has ate
tempted to circulate thruout the world
to the effect that England has been
feasting on white bread and other delr
‘cacles and has been compelling the
other allies to starve.

Ml', Masczeld refuted a numb ~ of
lies which Germany has published
about England, giving absolute proof
of their falsity. it has been said that
England is intent only on moneyeinak-
ing, that her subjects have no concern
tion of serving the state, and. further»
more, that in the face of real opposi—
tion, they prove cowardly. 4,500,000
Englishmen volunteered for service
before the draft went into eifect. and
3,000,000 others were rejected because
of physical unlitlleSS. England could
have rcmained out of the war, but she
chose to enter, and in doing so she
has lost 2,500,000 men.

Bloody lino ever Passes

"Germany has iiisinuated that Eng-
land has not taken her fair share in
this wa " he said, "At present, we
hold oneethird of the line in France,
