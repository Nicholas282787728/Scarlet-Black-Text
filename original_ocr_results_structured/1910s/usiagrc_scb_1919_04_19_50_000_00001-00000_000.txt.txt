NINE GHINNELI MEN TU
GIIMPETE IN CARNIVAL
AT DES MIIINES TODAY

Hess, Vinsel, Evans, Minty, Cow-
den, V. Daubenberger, and
Larsen Make Trip.

' SCARLET WILL ENTER
HALF 'AND MILE TEAMS

Kass and Cowden May Be En-
tered in Hundred — Many
Rooters Accompany Team. ‘

Nine men accompanied by Coach
"Doc" Huff, left this morning for Des
Moines to compete in the tenth annaul
relay carnival at-the Drake stadium.
in which the best athletes of the mid
dle west are entered. Grinncll will
enter two teams, a mile and a half-
mile, and may also enter Cowden and
Mass in the special loo—yard dash.

Lineup Is Uncertain.

The Grinch athletes who made the
trip are: Hass, Vinsel, Evans, Minty,
Cowdcn, Crane, Hoyt, v. Dallbehr
bcrger, and Larsem Just how the
teams will line up this afternoon is
uncermin, as two extra men were ta-
ken to Des Moines. Mass will prob
ably start the half—mile relay, with
yinsel, Minty and Cowdcn in the order
named. Evans has been fighting hard
for a place, and may run instead of
Vlnsel. The composition of the mile
team will prohably he Crane, Hoyt,
Daubenbcrgcr, and Minty, in the order
named, altho Larsen may be given a
chance to run.

Grinncll will have stiff competition
this year, as the Scarlet and Black
will run in the university class instead
of with-tho colleges. Last year, run—
ning in the college class, Grinnell an»
nexed first place in both the mile and
half—mile relays.

Half-Mile In Two Heats.

Due to the large number of teams
entered, the half—mile event has been
divided into two heats. The Big Ten
teams will run in one heat, and Mis-
souri, Drake, Kansas, Grinnell and Ne.
brasha, of the Missouri Valley, to»
gether with Notro name, will compete
'in the second heat. This arrangement
will- increase the rivalry, and gives
Gr nell a fair chance of copping first
place. Prospects of a win for the
.mile team are not so bright, but Grin.
ncll has'seldom had four men of the
high calibre of those who will com—
pete today,

The loo—yard dash will be the feat-
uro event of the afternoon. Among
the men entered in this race are John
son of Michigan, Haddock of Kansas,
Butler of Dubllque. Colby of Iowa, and
Hess and Cowden of Grinnell. Be—
cause of the large number of entries,
both Hess and Cowden may not run,
but one of tho two will probably coma
note.

The Scarlet and Black will be well
represented by a cotcrio or rootcrs
who accompanied the team to Dcs
Moincs. Fast time, and some broken
records may be looked for. as the
track will he in good condition,

“You probably know that I got back

took up work in this Gl‘innell»China
school as a representative from Grin-
nell College. While I am glad I am
having the espousibilities of educat—

am really missing Grinuell and my
happy college days with you all there
in old Grinncll. I fail to tell you i
and llfkthe fellowship and the Grin-

pleasant years spent there,

“China now is with her friendly sis-
ter countries celebrating the great vice
tor-y, which means that autocracy and
despotism are defeated and that de—
mocracy is bound to establish on
earth. My countrymen do not undere
stand what democracy means. That
is why I am teaching here. I am do-
ing my bit in planting the seeds of a
real democracy in the minds of the
young who wrll be the leaders of the
nation. That is what education is
doing and especially Christian educa-
tion is doing For China.

“I am writing ﬁrst to send my best

French Nation Wits First to Give
Recent War Its True Meaning,
In Speaker‘s Opinion,

TR’AGES FRENCH HISTORY
FROM ATTILA TO PRESENT

Says Victory of Marne 0n Spot
of Former Defeat Was
Work of Destiny.

Prof. Louis Allar Har ar-d ex-
change professor to Grinncll, speaking
on "The French Country and French
National snir , in the first of a series
of lectures on France in chapel Wod-
nesday morning, stated that France is
by the nature of her gcographical posi
tiou and the sp' it of her people, a uni
ﬂed and indivisiblc country a spite of
all political and religious differences.

“In spite of all thc Germans did to
stamp out the French spurt in Alsace,
they never succeeded,

“Before the war many Americans
were ignorant of France and many
Frenchmen of America,” he stated.
“Certain forms of French magazines
and literaturc represent France as
much as the Police Gazette reproscnts
New York. The view of Paris as the
city of amusement was due to subtle
invisihlc propaganda by Germany in
this country."

Speaks In Chapel Thursday.

"France may well be proud of the
part she has played among the nations
thruout the Centuries,” declared Prof.
Allard, in his address on “France In
the History of the World," Thursday
morning in chapel.

“war has been for her a hard neces-
sity," he continued. “The history of
France appears to be a series of cone
tinuous battles. Most of our wars
have been defensive wars. At times
they became offensive wars when it
was necessary to catch her-adversaries
unawares,

“I do not wish to lessen the part of
,the Allies in this war. There is glory
for all. But is it not France who
ﬁrst of all has given the struggle its
true meaning. France, the spiritual
leader of the soldiers and statesmen?

Traces Historr-

"Thc kaiser, intoxicated by his

dream, made the first of a long succes-
sion of psychological blunders," ac-
cording to Prof. Allard. when he
thought the national spi t of France
had been weakened by internal 's-
sonsions. The poilrr casting away his
Ireligious and political creeds has been
one heart and one mind in order to
realize the words of the motto ‘Deeds
of God Thru France.‘ There w no no
Imorc religious or political parties. As
in (lie past she was going to fight and
(lie [or the lives of mankind."
I Prof. Allard traccd the history of
lFr-auce from the ﬁrst great battle of
,tlrc Marne in the ﬁfth century when
,Francc savor] herself and the world
from Attila and his ﬁlms, to the sec
and and crop grcatcr battle of the
Marne, where “she was destined to
dctrnd and save horsolf and the world
near on the same spot where she
had in the Middle Ages defeated the
barbarians."

He reviewed the encroachments of
bar different neighbors and explained
how she was compollcd to defend her
sclf continually from llel' powerful eller
mics. “Even when the French l'cvulll-
tiou fought a coalition of kings it was
only to save the country '

HER HUSBAND’S WIFE’
IS IIIEVEHLY STAGEI]

Acting Is Consistently G o o d —
Knies Gives Excellent Interpre-
tation of “Uncle John.”

Ionian and Aegis literary societies
gave a most amusing and satisfactory
presentation of Thomas clever farce,
"Her Husband‘s Wife," at tho Colonial
thcatro last evening.

'The story or the plot hinges around
\Irs. Stuart Randulph who. having
reached astute of mild niolancholia
decides that it is Ller duty to select
the woman who shall Drove to be the
most satisfactory wife for her husband
after hcl' death, which she believes im»
miuent.

Uncle Jolrlr Loads Encouragement.

The woman of her choice is Emily
Ladelv,‘ a. friend and until a short time
before secretly engaged to MYs. Ran-
dolph's brother. Richard Belden. Uncle
John Bclden, who has a rare sense of
humor, sees an opportunity for a good
time and encourages Mrs. Randolph
in her foolish plan. Many complica-
tions ensue. Miss Ladew agrees to
the plan of becoming engaged to Mr.
Randolph after the death of his Wif_e.
The apparent friendliness of Miss La-
daw and her possible husband arouses
Mrs. Randolph's jealousy. Richard
Beldcn hears that his formeLﬁztncce is
engaged .to another. Mrs. Randolph
slander-s her husband in order to kill
the ‘affcction which she believes is
growing between Miss Ladcw and her
Illusbzlud. After many amusing inci-
dents have been brought about by this
confusion a general confession is hold
and all are happily rccouc ed.

The acting was consistently good
thruout the performance. It would be
difficult to pick a decided star altho
Atwood Knics gave a most clever and
lurmorolls interpretation of (fuels John
Beldel'l. His lilies afforded him an
opportunity for a great deal of dry
humor and he was able to do them
Justice.

Paul Bowers playing the load among
the men as Stuart Randolph displayed
a good class of acting and afforded the
audience many opportunities for
laughter thruhisuttor despair at bar

PARTWAYTHRUGULLEGE

From 54 to 90 Per Cent of Mem—
bers of Student Activities
Are Working.

COLLEGE LOSES $225 ON
EACH STUDENT YEARLY

Statistics Show That Living Ex-
penses Hove Increased More
Than Stu‘dent Expenses.

Sixty-ulna per cent of all men at
tcuding Gl'lnnell barn at least part
of their expenses, according to a
pamphlet wluch has just been issued
from the college office. At tho pres-‘
out time, two-thir s of the men are
working, the average ruau having
earned 3196 during the year of 1917-18.

One of the most interesting tables'
is a. tabulation of the percentages of
men on the various student actlvlLles
who are wor- pg their way thru col—
lcgc. The list includes the Cyclone
board, athletics, Glee Club, Dramatic
club, and the Student Council. From
54 to 90 per cent of the members
of these organizations are working.

Cost of Year 15 $610.

Complete ﬁgures show the cxact ex-
pense of the average man in Grinnell
‘to be $310 including board, room,
‘tllition, and semester fee. The amounm
earned by various men working their
way are givon, together with charts
showing the relation of the cost to the
college to the COSK to the student. It
is shown that because of the demo-
cratic spirit’o! Grinncll and the low
average expenditure, it is possible for
one who spends but little over the
minimum to still enjoy fully the so-
cial life of the collcgc, and filter freely
into student activities.

Cost to College Is $22.5 Each.

A table showing the cost of 1 ing
increase compared with the student
expense increase at Grinnoll shows
that since the beginning of the war,
the cost of living has increased half
again as much 'as the student ex-
penses. It shows that because of the
largo faculty, the large number of
buildings, and the thoroness of in-
lstruction and equipment, each strident
costs Grinnell $225, but this excess is
cover-cd in part at least by the endow-
ment of $1,305,060 in productive funds.
Proofs of the stntcments are given
thruout and references to all classes
of students and'conditions are made.
It is espccially stated that there is
much work to be had in Grlnnoll, and
that good ivagcs are paid in this city.
