To the Editors:

I was very distressed by Ted
Price's article printed in the Dev
tober 11 edition of the SM? and
would appreciate your printing my
“liberal criticism" of his article. in
my opinion Mr. Price has done a
iirst class job oi misrepresenting
the liberal philosophy and in such a
way as is rather insulting to me as
a self confessed liberal.

First of all the definition Mr.
Price gave oi “pure liberal
thought" could not, in my opinion,
be further from the truth, Liberal
thought is not a tolerance of other
views. if one is to fix a definition to
liberal thought it might be better
described as an intolerance to any
action that would inhibit any in-
dividuals right to think feel and act
ina tree and inobtrusive way Such
a view is born out of a situatloll
where the teelings oi a group oi
people are suppressed by those
who control our society. Liberal
thought is aimed at “making the
world a better place", but not by
uniting all the people under ‘one
single outlook" or “one ii . in
my opinion such a view is norc
conservative than it IS liberal The
Idea of libei‘ality as I see it. is not to
”bring the interests oi the in-
dividual into harmony with the
interests oi the college" but to
allow the interests or the people to
become the interests at their
society and government.

Mr. Price must understand that
in dealing with a topic such as this
we are dealing in generalities. We
cannot actually bring the interests

oi all people together to iorm one
general interest because of cone
tradieting opinions. However, by
allowing the expression oi all
viewpoints and by considering
them all equally we can attempt to
reach a better seperation between
right-wrong, justice-injustice.
Certainly not a conclusive

sepcration but one that will result
in as much harmony in our society
as is humanly possible

The views expressed by Mr,
Prices’ Mr. Liberal on the subject
oicriticism l iound to be totally out
oi place in the article Mr price
begins with an expression oi a
social philosophy tlnd moves to an
expression oian opinion peculiar to
the behavior oi that individual
without distinguishing between the
tiio. inability to accept criticism is
a trait common to some people of
both the liberal and coiisci-vaiive
iactions inability to accept
eritic sin is not contingent on ones
liberality as Mr. Price seems to
suggest I‘m sure there are narrow
minded liberals around, but they
are not narrow minded because
they are liberal We must be
careiul not to misinterpret an
angry reaction to an ignorant
counterrviewpoint as inability to
accept criticism and not simply an
emotional attempt at rectitying

what one believes to be a mistake.
Finally, I consider Mr. Prices’
criticism, ii he meant it to be that,
to be anything but a criticism. His
misinterpretation oi liberal
philosophy is more oian insult than
a criticism. A criticism takes much
more intelligence and logical and
interpretation than he has
exhibited in his article. This is an
insult that any intelligent in-
dividual would ieel at the
projection ot such a gross
misrepresentation oi something
that many people have taken so
seriously as to devote much oi their

lives to.

Dear Editor.
I wish to attract support for a

economic problems now and for
times to come.

available. According to research
