O The Case for Self-Discipline.

One of the finer points of the “platform"
for the new Grinllell administration has
beell the emphasis placed on self»disciplinel

From tlle very beginning, President
Stevens has repeatedly pointed out the need
for letting each student decide his own
destiny.

“To achieve success, it is necessary for
the individual to put out self-discipline,” he
said in a chapel talk early last fall.

Although receiving a minor setback with
the introduction of the monitor method for
the taking attendance, the abolition of the
formal cut system is the greatest step ac,
complished to date towards establishing a
system wherein the student, alone, hangs
himself as he sees fit,

The administration should now carry on,
putting students on an absolute honor sys—
tem when taking examinations, removing
the prison-like atmosphere from the quad
rang-Te, and establishing a more liberal atti—
tilde toward d inking.

years to come? All anyone can do is at-
tempt to plot the course of coming events.
These are a few ideas that have occurred
to us:
(1) Military service over
Europe, Far East, North
South Americ .
(2) Participation in a postrwar per-
iod oi" unimaginable gravity—with mass
unemployment, rapidly multiplying na-
tional debt, ever increasing government
domination, and an anarchistic world
as inescapable factors.
3) Active or passive participation
in the second attempt at a world as-
sociation of nations, with the United
States as the principal power. -
These are momentous thoughts represent-
ing seemingly insoluble problems. Still, if
historical perspective is of ally value, these
same developments are all too likely to
materialize ill the future

As members of the so-called intelligent
class of society, we college students will be
called.llpon to help solve these forthcome
ing situations as they arise. Let us not live
our lives too blithely unaware of what lies
over the l‘lOl'iZO'ﬂi

G A Welcome Obituary.

Death came quietly and effortlessly to one
of Grinnell’s oldest and most unpleasant
inhabitants last week end—Susie Social
Problem. Her exit was so slldden that it
might have escaped the notice ol’ many of
us

seas—in
Africa or

Year in and year 0th [or the past decade,
Grinnell’s social program consisted of a
lollg line of dances, punctuated here and
there with a good fire or a blanket party.
Continual agitation for a more varied and
exciting program by the Scarlet and Black
caused no more than a ripple in the calm
displayed by campus socialitesl

Maybe it was the war fever, maybe it

s the excitement caused by the "third
term,” something catasclysmic happened to
give Grinnellians a new deal in social activi—
ties. Variety was stressed; provision was
made for the student body as a “hole, The
“Gadabout” idea ioolled fine on paper.

Twelve llay»l'acks creaking down East
Street started the program ill motion last
Friday night. The Prosperity party the;
golllowing evening was equally as success-
ll .

Along with five hundred other Grinnel-
lialls who have bought Gadabout tickets, we
are very happy over the new social set—up
and over the death oi' our ancient arch—
enemy, Susie Social Problem.

It is not read by the “pseudo-

0 THE PROPOSAL PUT up by
the Student Council to make the
job of campus social chairman a
nonrpaying' position, appalls this
department no end.

0 THE KID CONlessMAN as-
sulnes :th a student should be
happy to work 15 lo 30 hours a
week, to assume moi-e I‘Csponsh
bility than is held by the Presi-
dent of the Student Counclliall
for human and experience,

THERE IS HONOR,
and true, there is experience,
occasionally, there may be some
actual thanks to the job But all
that is Intangible. It isn’t fair to
ask anyone to devote um much
time to honor. without tossing in
a few hard-earned shckels to
prove sincerity.

o m BROTHERS KENT Himm-
TON and Hart DAVIS would de-
vote a. little time in investigating
the amount 0‘[ detail involved in
running an organization like Garl-
abouts, perhaps they would feel
differently on the subject.
