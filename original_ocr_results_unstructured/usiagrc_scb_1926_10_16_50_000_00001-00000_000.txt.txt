Today Must Be Homecoming.

As the fightin- Fioneel's and the
gusty Cyclones face the kickoff. the
preps are scratching their heads and
wondering just what it's all about.
With his nose in the hlaiteascr, a
twelve page Scarlet and Black Weight»
ing him down, and the cheers of "Are
we gonna heat Ames?” beating in, his
ears. and with a broken down voice
too hoarse to even cacklc “G—RJ-N-
N»E-L-L—.“ the yearling begins to
think there must be something going
on.

As the Flesh athlete drops from the
hold, alter the morning grid. ombat,
feels his head to make sure it's thcrc.
counts his teeth to find out huw many
are left, and replaces his ankle in its
proper position, he concludes that
something special is going on.

And in spite of his lack ot years
and his none .tco steady judgment, he
is right. This is the day when the
boys of '98 and the lads of ’26 come
back to appraise the value of the

. school and discover just how the
standards of his day have been kept
up. Today is the day when the Grin-
nell warriors take a crack at their
historic rivals. the Ames Cyclones.
Right 'now is the time the howling two
hundred forget their study problems
and bowl for the Scarlet and Black to
“tear into ’em.” This is the time
when mothers and fathers and sisters
and brothers, come to Grinnell to find
out just what the word college means.

Ruth Suckuw’s latest book, “Iowa
Interiors" is receiving “Sky-high"
praise from critics. G. D. Eaton in an
article which appeared in ‘the Sunday
book section or The World (New
Yurk). Says that, "Her latest batch of
stories (referring to “Iowa IntEriorp”)
is beautiful and impressive.” He com-
pares her to Dreiser saying, “Ruth
Suckow is to me as impressive a fig—
ure in the Short story as Dreiser in
fiction of the freight train length——
which is to say. the best. that this
country ol‘lers and ranking with such
masters as de hlaupassant and Cher
kov.”

“Iowa Interiors" is a. collection of
short slui‘ies in which the pathos of
the ettl‘tllly and Spiritual Struggles of
Simple characters is sympathetically
portrayed. The setting is of cuul‘se,
the one with which Miss Suckow is

eight years of fhu‘Lball relations have'
tanght both teams the fichlcness of
the so-called “dope."

The outstanding things on which
most of the sports writers base their
opinions are the 1772 drubbing the
Scarlet and Black handed Marquette,
and the apparent poor showing oi the
Cyclones against the Oklahoma Ag-
Sles.

Fear 0‘ er-cunl‘idanﬂe

in the Pioneer camp, Coach ”Mike"
sly-land has been lighting against a.
feeling of over-confidence resulting
lrom last week‘s victory over the
“Golden Avalanche." This feeling has
been a real obstacle in building up a
fighting morale. With Evalm now eli~
gible and available to the team, there
is a little more competition for back-
lield heitlis. Even with this added
material there has been a listless alr—
titude in the Pioneer camp. other-
wise, Gl-iimell shows several indica~
tions of improvement.

Lamb, who played s .
sistcntly against Marquette,

ward passes will bulletelikc accul—
acy. whilc Evahn and McLain are fol-
lowing suit. 0n the receiving end,
Rinclcrt has shown marked improve-
ment in snagging “Dopey's” shots,
while l‘iblo is also working well on
tho recciving end. Apparently Evahm
is determined to see service against
times for his running has been a
bright spot in this week’s practice
Stotts is delinitcly out of the game.
while Peter-Eon and s McClain. whn
suffered a wrenched knee Wednesday
night, should be in good shape.

Though the Oklahoma Aggies regis-
tered a 13-0 win over Ames, the Far—
mers showed more power and promise
than the‘ score would indicate. The
laws state team is largely made up
of sophomores and green men, and a .
week's intensive drill alter a. hard
game may work wonders in the cle-
velopment of such a squad.

largely inexperienced. Ames' playing
is steadied by the work of Captain
“Bud" Coo at end, and by his brilliant
printing. '

Ames has been working on a defense
for the style of play which Grinnell
has adopted this year and may spring
a surplise or two herself. ‘
