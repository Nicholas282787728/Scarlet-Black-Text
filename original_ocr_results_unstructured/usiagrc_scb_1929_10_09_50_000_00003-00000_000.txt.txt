Pageant Has Tcn Episodes.

Ten episodes with four symbolic
dance interludes make up the pag-
eant which is based on the old rec—
ords and conversations with pio-
neers. Included in the cast of char—
acters are 1.53. Grinnell. played by
A. J. Blakely. jr.; Horace’ Breeley.
played by the Reverend E. M. Vit-
tum; Professor L. F. Parker, played
by Dean .1. S. Nollen; Mrs.‘ L. F.
Parker played by Mrs. Grant Ram-
sey; John Brown. Prof. L. P. Sher—
man; Col. Cooper. Dr. E. E. Harris.
and others. .

The first episode is devoted to a
scene between Horace B. Greeley and
.l. s. Crinnell which supposedly gave
rise to the memorable quotation on
the part of the former of "Go West.
Young Men. Go West." Next comes
the dedication as to a town site in
which Grinnell. i-Iamiln. and Hoiyoke
participate. Following this is an
episode of the first, family's ar—
rival. which in turn is followed by
the meeting of the Iowa hand.

The following scene portrays the
merging of‘Iowa college and Grin-
nell university and is succeeded by
an epi ode called the ‘Dance or the
Prairi Fire.” The John Brown inci—
dent comes next. Following this are
scenes showing the news of the Civil
war: outbreak, and the news of the
war's end. The building of the first
railroad and the attempt to’ found a
saloon are the themes of later scenes,

As a finale all the characters will
pass behind a gauze curtain toxglve
the effect of a moving picture re—
view of Grinnll's history.

The new fire exits at the quad-
rangle are nearing completion. Grin—
nell college, as always. is being a
good citizen and is observing fire
prevention week.

The weather: Wet and rainy Wed-
nesday and Thursday. probably fol-
lowed by Friday in north and west
portions.

Somebody is losing an opportunity
for some heavy free advertising. and
that’s the picket fence company who
put up the dainty wrought iron spik-
es. ("This service is free")

Looks as if the cloister walls are
being knocked out to allow the ele-
pbantrs to'move in from the zoo in
cold weather.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET ANT) BLACK

Wonder if the fond parents knew
what they were doing‘ when they
brought that brand new stack of
fresh blankets all the way from Chi-
cago for their collegiate offspring.
This should be a warm winter and a
hot spring for the young lad.

The prize Scotch story of this week
is the one about the two college girls
in Cottage Four who have taken to
smoking corn»cob pipes. The pro-
fessional cigarette bummers hope
that other Highland Lassies will not
follow suit. .

To the blonde freshman co—ed from
Fort Dodge who ran all the way to
chapel to hear Prexy sing: Although
to be gullible does mean to be fed.
it does not mean to eat too much.
Eat to your heart’s content in the
dining room, but after you get out
do not let people feed you. See?

end of the first half. Butterﬁeld and

last half minute of play.
