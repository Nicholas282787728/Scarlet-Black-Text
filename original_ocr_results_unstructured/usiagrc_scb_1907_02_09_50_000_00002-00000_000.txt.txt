A Chance to Boost,
With the student body decied out
inbig red buttons ard a wave or de»
termined enthusiasm for the raising
of the college endowment fairly start.»
ed on its way, the time has come for
real work. Every one knows just
what the conditions areand just what
is needed in order to establish Iowa
College on a ﬁrm ﬁnancial basis. The
nest kliirg is to "‘bcosL' the bricks
and mortar up to the top so the men
there ran dothe milk”. Faith and
Hope have made their appearance:
now let Charity ctmplete the trio.

An opportunity is cilered right now
tor the student body to show its grit.

It has become a custom at Grinnell
to make the mid-winter society and
class social functions the most elabor-
ate orthe year. The sophomores and
therjuniors are expected to entertain
the other two college classes to a for-
mal way which implirs the outlay ota
considerable amount of money. Other
eventsare added to these whith raise
thetotal to a large sum. This fact
gives the student tcdy its chance, Let

THE PUBLIC ROSTRUM.

As a basis ior argument some. guess
Lions have a most peculiar aLthllUn.
There is a quasi ion oitltis sort iniowa
College and periodically itcomes forth
to -itrcite discussion. This question
has to do with the design or the
Malt ese Crossand “Honor G" and the
issue is in regard to whether this em-
blem belongsexcluswely to the depart-
ment oi athletics or whether it be-
longs to the college and ls subject to
iree use by any organization so desir-
ing. It is time the question was
settled one way or the other-germs
of disagreement should not he harbor-
ed. The tinoe for such settlement
seems at hand as the question is at
issue in connection with thechoice of
a unitorm alumni pin. Many desire to
employ the MdlLese Cross and l'G”
emblem. Many do not. The writer
shares the latter belief. The fact that
it is through the success or the college
in athletics that this emblem has been
raised to its present high regard,
would seem an argument in favor of
leaving it to that department. The’
further fact that aside from a few
who have knowingly or innocently
disregarded the wish or the Athletic
Union, this emblem has been restrict-
ed to the use or that body for some
years, would further invite the belief
Llldbbylong possession alone than or-
ganization should be given priorright.
The fact that the college should have
some exclusive symbolstandiog tor its
athletic prowess and activities and
that the Maltese has ever stood for
such is a iurther argument. Then
again why not beorlginal? Why make
the alumni pin or any class pin a
parody 0nd. pin and emblem already
extant? What has given the llla'tese

cross its value and regard in the b‘ﬂlll‘
or the alumni and student body? Not'

because it has on one or two occasions
been used as the basisior a class pin.
not becouselt has been used by mer-
chants andotiiers as an advertising de-
vice. Nob because it has been used by
the college as an emblem, because it
has not. Why then, we ask again, does
it enjoy its popularity? Simply be-
cause it. has adorned the breasts or
so many victorious athletes whose ex-
empiiacation or the "Grinnell spirit,”
has made the school rainous.
