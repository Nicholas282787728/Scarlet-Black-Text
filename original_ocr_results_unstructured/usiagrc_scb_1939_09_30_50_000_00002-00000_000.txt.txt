PREP-BEATINGI.

Again, the perennial question: To beat or
not to bcat‘.7 This year, as in other years,
tlle problem of prepvbeating confronts the
upperclassmeniand the freshmen, but from
a different ”angle”.

Already, reports of the irresponsible and
unqualified delegation of this traditional
privilege to all upperclassmen in certain
halls are circulating. And already rumors
of the abuse of this right have attached
themselves to these reports Thus, in the
second Week of the school year, has prep~

beating placed itself once more squarely be-

fore the students of Grinnell,

From time immemorial, hazing has been
the accepted privilege of upperclassmen and
the accustomed ordeal for freshmen. In
other times, much of the hazing was bare
barous, an expression of the latent savage-
ly in mankind and an outgrowth of the ide—
ology that brutality made a “man” of the
freshman. ,

Today, we have advanced a long way
from this older conception of hazing. To
day, ollr “prepping" follows a more hu-
mane and a more intelligent toursel “Prep"
caps, mail carrying, shoe shiningithese
and similar freshman duties, along with two
short “Hell weeks," have become the pillars

of Glillnell hazing. But tradition dies hard
—and at no place harder than Grinnell—
and that timchonored bulwark of the hue
ing of other days, the wooden paddle, hangs
Oll.

With an intelligent use of this engine of
destruction we have no quarrel, but it is
our contention that an intelligent use does
not include the unlimited right of all upper-
classmen to employ it at their own discree
tion. Unless we are to revert to bygone
days of campus primitiveness, a reasonable
use of the paddle can only mean that it
shall be used m a disciplinary measure by
responsible upperclassmen.

Immediately, of course, the cry arises:
Such limitations upon the use of the paddle
would result in cocky, unmanageable fresh-
men But there need be little fear of that.
The right to enforce freshman discipline
via the paddle would remain, but it should
be placed ill the hands of responsible per
sons, such as the house council, to be exer-
cised upon legitimate complaint.

To beat or not to beat? For reasonable
disciplinary purpose, yes. But for upper-
class entertainment or spite, no!

A CALL FOR MEN

The first meeting of the Pioneer Chorus
on Wednesday evening was, as usual, a suc—
cess. There were both enthusiasm and
good music from over a hundred women—
and less than twenty men.

Now a group of Singers can have fun to»
gether, even when the tenor is scarcely
more than an obligate and the bass only a
faint rumble. For those who like to sing,
singing is full any time, whether on the
concert stage or in the showel: But while
fun is the purpose of the Pioneer Choms, it
is not intended to be anything so informal
as a bit of after-dinner harmony in the
clubroom; it is a lnusical organization, in—
tended to furnish pleasure not only to the
participants but on occasion to lisixzners as
well. The music with which the members
will be Working is not the latest addition to
the Hit Parade, which you are hearing ev»
erywherc else, but music of more permanent
value, froln Negro spirituals to choruses
from light opera. Though these can be a
pleasure both to sing and to hear sung any—
where, only the balanced chorus for which
they were intended can do them justiccl

Entering the chorus is like entering acol-
lcgc course in that an hour’s credit is of-
fered for a year’s membership, But there
are no examinations, no grades, no outside
reading assignments—only an hour’s fun
once a week. The pr equisitcs al' Simplcﬁ
an ear and an enthusiasm for music are all
that are necessary.

So the Pioneer Chorus issues a call for
men, Fifty or seventy five more will make
of it it large and balanced musical organb
zation. The glorified girls’ glee club it is now
will go on enjoying themselves and making
good music, of course; but why let the girls
have all the full?
