Jazz great plays Roberts this Saturday

by Lorri Lohmann

. "The biggest concert or the year,"
that's how Major Concerts Chairman
Dan Fielding described the McCoy
Tyner Quintet perlormances scheduled
for this Saturday. The Tyner concert is
being jointly sponsored by the Public
Events Committee and the Student C0117
certs Committee. It will be the second
Public Events sponsored performance
this year. the first being the Goldovski
opera in October, and unique tor the
committee in that iazz music is
featured.

McCoy Tyner seems more than
deserving of this big campus billing.
Downbeat magazine has rated him
number one iazz pianist tor the past
seven years, over such jazz greats as
Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Herbie
Hancock and Oscar Peterson.

: Tyner got his musical start early and

when at age 17 he met John Coltrane,
the two agreed that Tyner would
hecome a part of the band Coltrane
hoped to create. A couple of years later
Tyner made his recording debut with
Jazztet, a new group led by Art Farmer
and Benny Golson. He cut his time with
Jazztet short when Coltrane contacted
him and said that the band they had
discussed was finally being realized.

Press literature on the Coltrane
groun uniformly uses the word
“seminal" to describe the band, which
included Elvin Jones on drums and
usually Jimmy Garrison on bass. Dur
ing his six years with the group Tyner
recorded 20 albums with them as well
as a few under his own name on the Im-
pulse label. He left the group in 1965 and

went through {we years of rough times
as Jazz in general sul'lered during the
late '605. He recorded [or Blue Note
during this time but his albums with
Ron Carter, Joe Henderson and others
found little commercial success.

in the 705 Tyner's music quickly
gained recognition. l-ie switched to
Milestone Records and his ﬁrst album
on the label, sahara (19727, was

nominated lor two Grammies and “am. ’

ed Album of the Year by the Downbeat
critics poll. As Contemporary
Keyboard said in l976, "Unques-
tionably, the days when McCoy Tyner
was known as ‘John Coltrane's planist'
have passed " He has become recogniz-
ed as a versatile performer, composer
and arranger and to many the jazz
pianist.

Tyner Wlll tie Joined Saturday in

Roberts Theater by Avery Sharpe on'

bass, John Blake on violin, Joe Ford on
reeds and Ronnie Burrage on drums.
Listeners should look for Tyner's per-
cussive style on the piano. As he said,
”The piano became more at a rhythmic
instrument to me, more like a drum, I
guess . . . 1 can truthtully say I have
lound a friend there. It's like an arm or
a leg, part oi me I can use it lor almost
total expresssion.' Unlike many jazz
musicians, Tyner has remained loyal to
acoustic piano. While he agrees to use
an ampliiier so as not to be drowned
out, he has felt no desire to change over
to electric keyboard. The power and
feeling he has for his medium is reason
enough to stick With it
