Peace Day ‘
aims for action.

by Kim Eckart and
Jennifer Watson

The second All-Iowa Peace Day
will be held this Saturday, April
29. Under Lhetheme“Questioning
Our Commitment,” this year‘s
event features Vietnam War vet»
eran S. Brian Willson, storyteller
Floating Eagle Feather, and Grin-
nell College board of trustees
member John Chrystal.

The theme was chosen by the
Peace Day Committee in order to
challenge people to consider the
degree of their involvement in
working for peace. “Peace is such
an abstract issue. Are people will-
ing to work for peace? Are they
just going to go enjoy Peace Day,
or are they going to start some
grass-roots organizations?" said
organizer Tom Berger.

According to co»organizer
DanielaSteiner,Peaee Day 1989 is
more than aday off. “We’re trying

to be more serion

We hope that this wttl
inspire people, rather r‘?
than making it just a ;/
day offforbeing peace»
fut," she said.

This year's program
includes six more
workshops than last year, several
of which are conducted by stu—
dents, and one fewer band. “We
hope that people will take this into
their lives. We try to have a total
things for different interests," said
Steiner.

the keynote address, “Questioning
Our Commitment.” Willson, who
is vice-president of the Associa»

Students harassed,
Crady and police

chief urge

by Stephen Hardwick

Several incidents of illegal
entry, including a Lhcft, have
prompted dean of student affairs
Tom Crady to ask all students to
exercise additional caution on
campus,

On Wednesday, April 12,
students spotted two men
entering James and Cleveland.
According to Police Chief Dan
Boyer, the men are in their late
205. One is about 5 feet 10
inches tall with black hair and a
full black heard The other is 6
foot 1 inch with brown-blond
hair. Neither Crady nor Boyer
knows' whether the two men
spotted entering the dorms are
responsible for the theft. There
have also been several incidents
of men following women on
campus.

“It was perceived that [several
men] were approaching students,
approaching women," Crady said,
“They were up in KDIC when
nobody was up there. r .and the

cauﬁon

police saw them walking back to
the ear and got the information
and we went ahead and banned
them from campus," Crady said.
The event occurred last Sunday
night. Three men have been
banned from campus as a result
of the harassment incidents. If
the men return, they will be
charged with criminal trespass

Crady explained the reason
that he banned the men from
campus. “Generally our main
concern is making sure that if
people are approaching students
on campus and if students are
feeling uncomfortable about
them, it‘s inappropriate and they
shouldn't. be here.”

Boyer said that a man from
town is one of the men who was
banned from campus. “Miles
Phipps apparently matched the
description of someone in a car in
Darby gym lot who was
following or somehow made one

Chai and Matthews win
Nanjing Fellowships

by Jessica Weisel

Two Grinnell seniors will
spend 1989-90 year as Grinnellr
Nanjing Teaching Fellows.
May-lee Chai and Rebecca
Matthews, selected because of
their command of English and
their experience with other cul-
tures, will teach highrschool En-
glish in China.

In the third year of the teacher
exchange between Grinnell and
Nanjing Universuy, Chai and
Matthews will teach at Nanjing
Number 11 High School while
Grinnell hosts a professor from
Nanjing University.

Chai studied in Nanjing last
semester and IS excited at the
prospect of teaching high school.
While in Nanjing, she taught an

adult class in English, and she
said regarding the experience, “I
teamed a lot about Chinese soci-
ety and Lhe conﬂicts going on."
She hopes that the fellowship
will give her insight into
tecnagcrs’ views of the same
subjects. From her semester in
China, Chai learned that Chinese
people don’t consider her a “real"
American, because she is of Chir
ncse descent. “(The highrschool
students) might be disappointed
because I look so Chinese to
them," She said.

Matthews. who has never
visited China before, said,
“Obvlously l'm hoping thtn my
