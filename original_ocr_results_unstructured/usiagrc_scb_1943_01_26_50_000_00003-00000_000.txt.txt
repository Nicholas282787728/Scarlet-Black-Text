GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Only Governmeni Order Can
Alier Housing Arrangemenis Now

Absolutely no further changes will be made in the physical
setup of Grilmell college unless the government makes a
clear order for e tension of the school facilities to some

service group, Dl

Samuel N. Stevens said yesterday in an

interview concerning- his recent trip to Washington, D. C.

Agreeing that it was time to
clarify the position of college ol-
ficals in this matter, stcvcns said
that under no conditions will this
school voluntarily oﬂer to relin-
qllisii any more of its present
housing or instructional equip-
ment.

“The larger social responsibility
that colleges have to the nation
cannot be satisﬁed by merely de—
fining patriotism in terms of the
smallest common denominator,"
Stevens said.

”The real worth of Grinnell is
in providing a liberal arts educa-
tion to its student body. I believe
we shall have that student body,
made up of women and such
numbers of men as the govt/TIP
ment allows.” ,

Stevens stated tliot'it is his
belief, after conferring With man-
power commission head Paul v.
McNutt, and the assistant scorer
tary of war in Washington, that
a new plan for the education of
men of draft ages, completely dif—
ferent than any yet released, will
be underway by spring.

“No plan yct submitted has
completely satisfied the collcges,

sqllelchcd rumors of another sel'e
ricc school being planned

the military group, and the inan-
pcwer olficials, I believe the new
plan \\'ill put thousands more 18
and 19-year olds in school next
year than anyone iiow estimates.

“Certainly we have no desire
to ‘Ireezc’ the possibilities of this
school by committing ourselves
at this early date for another
service school here. While in
Washington 1 received several
highly satisfactory offers for such
schools, but this college will make
no more changes on a voluntary
bosi l'

stevens emphasized that the
possibilities of Crinnell to be Con—
sidered are more than financial.
We are capable of remaining a
self-supporting institution indefi»
iiitcly under present arrange
nieiits. If another school ever
comes here it will be because the
government has decided we are
worth more to the war effort un-
dcr those arrangements. and not
because the college will improve
its financial position

“Tlint change will come about
under a government order. if no
orders are forthcoming, Grinneli
will not change. g

“There is a more important
kind of patriotism than simply
throwing ourselves, pcll-mell. at
the government. Our kind of pa-
triotism means staying put, con-
tinuing to offer a Grinncil educnr
tion to our Criiinell student body.
Therefore we must retain the
main living quarters and a physie
cal nucleus for activity. To dear
prive students of all connections
with the campus and buildings and
housing arrangements is, in a
way, to deprive them of a Grin-
nell education. That wc shall not
do voluntarily."
