Hegemony...and how to regaiiilt’

There are a tow things bothering me
this week. and one oi them is the way
that Americans ingeneral and Grin-
nellians in particular are caving in to
the iatal temptations oi irresolution
and appeasement. The American ilag
is being spat upon in all corners oi the
globe, and what are we doing about it?
Whimpering and whining that the
world situation is too complex, that we
don’t really understand what’s going
on or what to do about it, and voicing
all sorts oi moral and ethical reservas
tions about taking decisive action,

while we cringe and cower, holding
candlelight marches instead oi mar-

.ching to the recruiting oiiices,
American vital interess are being
trampled upon by Russians. lranians.
Aighans, lndians, Syrians, Panama»
nians. Arabs especially, and every
kind oi ioreigner you might want to
name.

Nations which once trembled at

,American power and righteousness
now laugh in our tace. in this at-
mosphere oi coniusion and retreat, the

.Communist master plan {or enslaving
the Free World continues to inexe
orably uniold in Aighanistan,
Yugoslavia, lran, Vietnam, Cuba,
Kudistan, and the South Lounge oi the
Forum. We are no longer Number
One, and our national pride and
security are endangered,

What, then, are we to do to make
the world sale tor American power
and inﬂuence? Precious little. it one
were to take the advice or namby»
pamby prolessors and peaceniks,
whose highvminded rhetoric oi morali»
ty, moderation, and interdependence
obscures the basic tact that we have
become a nation of wimps. The inter-
national scene has changed little ironi

Despite the foreign policy triumphs
oi Nixon, Kissinger, and Carter, the
American people are suddenly
plagued with guilt and reservations
about hold interventionist moves
abroad and tough mobilization
measures at home. Everyone ivants to
hold onto his own little piece oi the
pie, constantly complaining about lack
oi leadership while reiusing to be led
anywhere. No one has been willing to

Moreover, this is no time to question
