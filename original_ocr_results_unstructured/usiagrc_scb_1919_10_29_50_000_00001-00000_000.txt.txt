now and work is progressing rop-

“The Truth" is perhaps the best
known of Clyde Fitch's dramas, and in
fact was Considered by the author him-

action deals with the eternal triangle,

ity and of custom.

Fred Lindon and his wife. Eve, are

lady of the play, under a pretense or
t"illg to reconcile the couplc is really

donly upon one of their meetings is led

athletes a great advantage over their

The name was selected by the Honor

C committee in charge of the Contest
rrom a list of one hundred and ﬁfty
s blnitted suggestions, The ﬁnal de—
ci on lay between Trojans and Pion-
eers, the latter being chosen because
of its siguiﬁcnncc in connection with
the history of the collcgc. Other
popular names were the Cardinals, the
near Cats and the Cubs.

The history of Gl'innell makes “Tho

rname for her athletic teams. In 1868
