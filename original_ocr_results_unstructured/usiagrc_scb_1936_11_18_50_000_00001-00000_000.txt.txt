Determined to add one more
game to the win column before
the close of the season Friday at
St Louis University the Pioneer
varsity grid squad romped over
the hapless freshmen in a scrim»
mage session Tuesday which ends
ed under the lights. Feature of
the varsity play was the best
brand of blocking displayed here
for a long time.

Harry Barker, returning to the
Squad to bolster an lnjury»\veak-
ened backtield after an absence
of three weeks, flashed mid-sear
son form as he drove through
the freshman line for substantial
gains Buck Show showed an
unusual display of shifty ball-
carrying.

Luck [loser-res

Although the Pioneers will be
strengthened by the return of
Barker, injuries sustained in the
Geo game Friday have crippled
the team and taken a heavy toll
of the reserve strength. Welton

Speedball AII~Stars
Lose Sunday, 11-]

\

Causing considerable chagrin to
those men who picked them as
All-Stars, the intramural “All-
Americans" in speedball, bowed
in defeat Sunday afternoon to the
"second" team by the lopsided
score of 11-1

The contest at times, took on
an aspect of a cross between a
boxing exhibition and a football
game until the end of the first
half the score stood 1-0 in favor-
of the all-stars and it looked like
anybody's game but at the start
of the second half the winners
really began to click and the
game became merely a question
of how large a score they would
run up on the favorites,

Jerry Bauer was outstanding
for the victors with his defensive
play while Granny, Thede, and
Conwill were the main scorers.

,For the losers Harvey and Dean

were outstanding.
