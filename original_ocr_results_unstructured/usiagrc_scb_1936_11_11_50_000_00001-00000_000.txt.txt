Losing Halls
Will Protest

Clark and Langan Claim
Dibble Disqualified

Protests against the victory in
the intramural cl‘oss»counti'y run
by Dibble hall's harriers will be
entered by Clark and Lnngan halls,
it was learned today. A disagree-
ment as to which hall George
Brown, first place winner. was as-
sociated with, arose between Clark
and Dibble, each of the northern
halls claiming the services of the
winner. The second protest comes
as a result of allegations by par-
ticipants in the race that one of
Dibble's entries was paced in the
race by a varsity runner.

“One of the rules of cross-
country running is that no partici.
pant may be paced by a runner
not entered,” explained Roy Jen-
sen, varsity croSSACDul-itry inan—
ager. He stated that if the rule
is broken, the team guilty of the
infraction is automatically dis-
qualified.

Jensen said he had not been r
lisbiy informed concerning the in-
cident in question, and that since
he did not witness the race, he

Name‘HerdBook’
Used by Ancient
Anglo-Saxons

Anglo-Saxons in the time of Al—
fred the Great had a herd-book.
too, but they called it the “Hier-
deboc.” This ancient ancestor of
the college student directory was
King Alfred's translation of a
sixth century manuscript, the "Li-
ber regulae pastoralis” of Pope
Gregory the Great.

Paul s. Wood, professor of En-
glish, in telling his English sem-
inar class of the old manuscript,
also gave his version of the orie
gin of the present use of the
term “herdebook.” He declares
that Iowa State college at Ames
keeps a directory in its agricul-
tural college which fits the die»
tionary detinitio . ”A book con»
taining the list and pedigrees of
one or more herds, as of choice
breeds of cattle."

Some disgruntled Ames man,
thumbing the strident directory in
search of a date, applied the term
herdebook in disguest, Mr. Wood
says, and it was considered so
appropriate that it has stuck, and
even spread to other colleges.

Becker Tells
of After-War

Cynicism

j ”When BoysCame Home”
l Topic of Armistice
5 Day Address

“ “I invite you to be cynical
tabout one thingethe subject of
lwar, because it doesn't fulfill its,
Ipl‘omises," This was the keynote
of the Armistice day address made
iat an all-college convocation in
iHel‘l‘iCk chapel this morning by
the Rev. Paul Becker of the Uni-
versity church of Des Moines.

Speaking on the topic, “When
the Boys Came Home,” Dr. Becker
told of the national psychological
changes caused by the war, and
the terrible idealistic bubbles that
burst after it.

Four Questions

He asked and answered four
questions. The first, “What
caused us to get into the war?"
he declared was not yet solved,
though he proposed many‘ reasons,
idealistic and selfish.

“Why did we keep the boys
over there? Because of the hys»
teria and tension caused over here
by war propaganda," Dr, Becker
stated. Tales of German atroci-
ties, the Kaiser as AntieChz-ist,
and the attitude that the Huns
were so perverted that killing
them was a kindness were cited
by Dr. Becker as examples of the
propaganda.

Idealistic Motives

Idealistic motives also kept us
in the war, he said. "Making the
