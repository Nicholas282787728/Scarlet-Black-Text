Spanish, Russian and German Houses
sponsor Trotsky Seminar

Leon Trotsky: Man or Myth, will be the
subject of almost two weeks of activities
sponsored by the Spanish. German and
Russian Houses. Three continents will be
incorporated in the search for the man
called Trotsky (Lev to his friends).

Leon loved music and revolution. Rus
sian House will sieze the initiative and
study this side of his personality tod ,'
between 7-9 am. and on Sat. at i? am.-
noon, when Diane Fisher and then Jim
Goodfellow will feature Russian and Soviet
music on their KDIC shows, in honor of

this 64th anniversary of the Russian‘

Revolution, Leon was an outstanding
orator and when Lenin wrote that the
revolutionaries should be prepared “to oc-
cupy without fail and hold at any cost: the
telephone exchange, the telegraph office,
the railway stations and above all the
bridges." Leon immediately went for
mass media. Leon loved a crowd,

Also tonight, Spanish House will focus on
Leon's later_ years with their Caribbean

bar in Gardner lounge at 9 p.m. been
spent a lot or cold lonely years in exile in
Siberia so you can imagine how much Leon
enjoyed lying on a warm beach, drinking
his rum punch, listening to a marimba
band and lamenting permanent revolur
tion.

On Saturday the focus is again on Leon s
years in Russia with a party in Russian
House at a pm. Russian House will
celebrate the exciting years when Leon
joined the Bolsheviks and organized the
Red Army. Everyone is invited to bring
their favorite Trotsky trivia and Of course
the winner of the Trotsky looksalike can
test will receive a copy oi Leon's Our
Revolution.

Sunday brings us back again to Leon's
last few years in exile. A coffee house from

about a man, who in complete abhorance
oi the treacherous murder of Leon in Mex-
ico City locks his iamily in their house.
This is perhaps a final statement on the
allure and dedication of Leon Trotsky.

German House explores Leon's middle
years. Grinnell's own musical Angela
Davis, Karin Stein, will again sing from

Leon spent a few years in Munich, too, In

put away quite a few ”brewskls," so beer,
pretzels and more food will be in abun»

light on their feet" Well, who knows but
when the band started you couldn‘t keep
Leon off the dance iloor, especially a good
proletarian dance like a Polka, which the

the essense of these unnatural things,
won't let him sleep. The situation often
ends up being very funny, in an odd way.
The tone of the film is striking and
poweriul. One source of this is the
sometimes very loud droning, oscillating
sound which occurs throughout the film
but is never explained. perhaps it is some
harmonic cosmic overtone. At any rate, it
casts a strange aura over the proceedings,
only increased by the cinematography.
which in moody blacks and whites echoes
the brilliant filming of The Elephant Man,
Overall one gets the feeling of some impen-
ding universe behind the events of the film
as it we were looking in on Henry and his
world through some window from outside.
