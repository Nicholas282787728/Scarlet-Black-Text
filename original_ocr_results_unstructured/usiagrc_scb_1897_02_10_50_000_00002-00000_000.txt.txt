FOR SEVERAL years past the
students of Grinnell having no
representative in the state orator-
ical contest have perhaps had
some excuse for their lack of in-
terest in the contest, but this year
no such excuse is available. We
have a representative of whom
there is no cause to be ashamed.
and we should give him the same
support as that accorded to our
contestants along other lines.
Oskaloosa is but» a short distance
from Grinnell. and the matter of
expense should not be a very
large item. Why notplan to send
a goodly delegation to cheer our
orator in the efforts he is maltlng
to bring honor to the institution?
If we intend to remain in the as-
sociation by all means let rrs Cn-
deavor to make a creditable show»
ing.

was a pleasure to compete. and
there is not a college in the as-
sociation but what will favor their
readmission providing they make
proper restitution.
