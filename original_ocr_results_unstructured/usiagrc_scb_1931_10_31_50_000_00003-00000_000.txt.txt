Town Associates
Petition for Right

Town men, in a meeting Thul'sclayi
night, voted to send resolutions toE
the council of house chairmen askingl
for the right to vote at house meets

building associates, such as sociali
functions. According- to a recent rill-i,
ing that privilege is now denied them, 1

They also sent a resolution to the‘
student council, risking to have al
representation on that body. Thel
town women are represented through
Faith Somers, president of the towni
women's association. Since there is
only one town man in the Pioneer

one more representative in that oru
ganization.

Chest fund campaign which is now
in progress on the campus.
