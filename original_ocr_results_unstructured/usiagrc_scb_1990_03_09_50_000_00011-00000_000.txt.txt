GROUPS: Environmental Groups Should Be Thanked

detrimental impact we have on the
environment, then they are doing a
good thing. Who is disadvantaged
by the people of this planet getting
together and solving planet-wide
problems? No one that I know.
(Maybe Mike Kent does?)

Kent sees the Greenhouse effect
asjust another Lrendy problem that
will “[enjoy] the spotlight for a
while, [make] a few opportunistic
scientists richwith grants, then [be]
passed on as not asbiga problem as
[it had been] cracked up to be."
Clearly this is a statement from a
petty individual wllo is uninformed
as to his subject matter. First, if
global problems have enjoyed any
spotlight, it has been that provided
by sensationalistic mediacoverage,

not environmental organizations.
Second, if scientists are awarded
grants for their research into pos-
siblesolutionsforthcseglobalprobr
lems. what is the harm? Won’twe
all beneﬁt from a solution to the
population crisis? Third, it is quite
possible that these problems would
have become something incredibly
serious if they were not recognized
as problems when they were. Isn’t

tively combating the total extincA

askKenl why he seems totllink that
this is a bad thing.

[do not see the logic thatcaused
Kent to come to the conclusion that
environmental organizations would
be a suitable topic for his weekly
attack. Iseethc logic in choosinga
topic with two sides. (Take for
example, abortion of gun control.)
However, the actions of most non-
profit environmental groups are
rooted in the commitment to solve
global problems. Wilat is the sec-
ond side to this topic? That they are

MAGILL: Anti—Semitism

in New Guise

in their silcnce they lend support to
this crystal clear bigotry. I believe
people, particularly educated
people, should stand up against such
hatred, no matter who it is directed
against, [or if they do not it will
surely engulf us all. To paraphrase
the theologian, Martin Niemollcr,
regarding resisting the Nazis:
”First they came for the
Communists, but I was si-
lent, for I was not a Commu-

nist. Then they came for the
Homosexuals, but I was Sl-
lcnt, for I was not a
Homosexual.Then they came
for Ute Jews, but I was silent,
for I was not a Jew. Then
they came for the Catholics,
but I was silent forl was not
a catholic. Then they came
for the trade unionists and I
was silent, for I was not a
trade unionist. Then they
came for me, and tllere was
no one left to aide me."

CULTURE: Are Weeks Effective
Teachers of Tradition

movies, and the all-campus Mat-
zoh Ball.

My concern. nevertheless, has
to do with the perception and un-
derstanding ofludaism with which
some students may leave the week.
IbelievcthatChalutzim has tried to
show the campus a strong part of
our culture and tradition. I cherish
the time I spend with other Jews:
the sense ofcommunity Ifcel when
surrounded by other Jews; and the
pleasure I receive from drinking
wine,.dancing the Hora, and sing-
ing songs in Hebrew. But what
drawsniclothesepeopleinthcfirst

place, what forms the strong bonds
I feel for the Jews from all over the
world, and what makes me want to
get to know the Jews I come across
in the middle of Iowa stems from
the love and respect I hold for the
Jewish faith. I desire to study To
rail and follow God's command-
ments.

It is my hope that the students of
this campus realize that Judaism.
both culture and religion, is rich,
ﬂowing very deep. Perhaps no
Jewish Cultural Week c'oulil givcto
Judaism that which Judaism de-
serves.

time and distance to put everything
into a new perspective."
