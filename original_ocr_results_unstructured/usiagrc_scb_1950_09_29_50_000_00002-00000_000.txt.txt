Uncertainty and Grinnell

The only certain thing ill the world is uncertainty.

And, this year, it’s evell more so. Americans wonder:
peace or war. Usually by this time, we would have settled
dovn into a busy little isolated system, with nothing more

important to discuss than the Ezzal'd Charles fight. Invl

steadybull sessions talk about Korea alid the implications
of the McCarran anti—Communist law. And the draft has
replaced that perennial favorite, sex ill conversation. We
start the year not knowing how it will end.

Groups sitting in the library look at a passing- girl
with speculation. Not, how is she on a date? but I’m in the
i0“? half of my class, will I be around long enough to know
ler.

Mr. Wasson sees the same thing in the bookstore.
Some don’t buy books because they don’t expect to use
them. Others buy them, just to get that settled feeling.

Two faculty members entered the service. How many
more will leave this year? And how will they be replaced?

The administration has its headache, too. Tile budget
has had to be cut $50,000, due to decreased enrollment.
money has had to be payed off here and there , and this has
caused all sorts of problems. ,

Bllt between certainty and uncertainty lies much mid—
dle ground. It‘s this middle ground that allows us to look
at the year ahead with reasonableness and purpose; it pre»
veil s those with even a slight amount of stability in their
status here to take stock 01' what they may expect. That
large majority of students which will finish the year here

look for : id to most of the some desirable, and un-
desnahle, aspects of living here that they have known be-
fore .or anticipated upon coming here. .They are basic. For
that reason they may seem overwor ed and trite. But they
remain the relatively certain thin> we can expect.

NO MATTER WHAT—We're in an atmosphere in which
we can learn. It' the teacher who “makes" a coulse doesn’t
stay here the year there are still books. If we forget that
the primary reason we were enrolled ill college was to use
academic opportunities, we’ll be failing to make use of one
of our comparative certainties.

NO MATTER WHAT—the truth is undeniable that

the more we do, the better time we have. There are ac
ti ties to suit the interests of almost every person in the
college. The time spent in them is time well-spent; if it is
an activity such as Camera or Science club it may add to
knowledge we use in our vocational field; if it happens to
be on the order of Orchesis or the Canter club it may ill-
cresuse our pleasure in being on campus at the time and
may be the source of recreation later.
» NO MATTER WHAT~year in, year out, the really
important thing is that we‘re surrounded by people. Peo-
ple brighter and duller than we, people who teach us and
whom we teach, people who are full alid who are unhappy,
people who are alive and those who seem asleep. They are
the clear-cut real advantage of being here; they are what
glre all the other aspects of a college shape.

Us true. There is little that can be said to be certain.

Bud capitalization on all of the relative certainties will l'erliallillg bodies, or gunshots Nor
were they under the influence,

in all interestingly full year.

Outside of This ' World

We pr cut a guest editorial by Mr. Frederick Bau—
lnann, the first of a series of editorials by distinguished
‘men who are felt by the editors to have reason to contact
students and ideas to merit the attention of the readers.

Whenever my young but able and scholarly colleague,
lMuni Frumhartz, speaks up with his now familiar refrain of
"bringing the gap between the academic and the practical
,word” what happens? Nothing; at least so far as we have
i'oeen able to detect, either in our words, ideas or actions:
We have known and accepted the situation, I am afraid
rather enjoyed it, this long time. It helps both students and
faculty lead an easier, softer, more supencilious life to pre—
tend that thirty-six months of isolation from the realities
lof the world can, in some mysterious way be the prop-
er, most adequate preparation for active participation in
the world of affairs. Nor, in my opinioll, are the adminis
tration anod trustees entirely blameless iii the matter.

Ill spite of all that they do for us, the trustees for ills
stance might visit a class now and theniwith proper ad-
vance notice, of course. The experience might be almost
as much fun as a game of golf or a fishing trip. It certain-
lyiif they would join in the discussion—could bring some
of the practicalities of life with which they are concerned
,to the students' attention in a forceful way, Field trips need
not be simply amusement excursions. With proper prepara-
tion and demands for results they can be infinitely more
educational than class-room work. Nothing in my entire
teaching experience was quite so effective a revelation of
some of the stupidities and farcical elements in the dem0v
cratic process as a trip taken some years ago to a state
political convention. We could have more visits to the cam—
pus by able lecturers, not the kind who dish out canned
talks for easy popular consumption but by men whom the

to say.
But, I suppose, the soothing drone of class-room lecs
tures will go on as ever. “Busyavork” Will be conjured up

-to keep the young ladies occupied and the young men will

kill time just to kill it. And while the faculty eagerly and
unendingly searches for some kind of “motivation” for our
charges, Korea remains merely a place on the second page
of the Des Ioines Register, the wild animals and elements
of the st; k world without as well as ideas of its ‘rich op—
portunities, are kept safely outside the academic walls

ARH stage, room eleven, and
the heating plant workshlp all
give evidence that the Grinnell
College Theatre is getting ready
to dust off the prosenium for a
new season. The emphasis this
year is on comedy and farce in
the four productions planned
there will be more than flfty
actors and actresses, plus all the
stage hands, electricians, student
directors, and make-up people.
An extended tour of several of
the productions is in the mak-
ing. In addition ,a new ticket
plan has been adopted.
‘ or immediate notice is
“Twellth Night" to be present
ed Homecoming Weekend, Oct.
26, 27, 28 Casting has been go~
mg on with an excellent turn—
out so far. There are seventeen
in the cast of Shakespeare’s most
liamous comedy. Mr. Rowland
lCl’lase is directing. The produc-
tion will Teatui-e theatrlcal styli-
zatlon; with continuous action in
sixteen scenes with one inter-
mlssion. “Twelfth Night” is one
of the plays which will go on
tour.

l

Dickens Novel

Tne dramatization pt Dickens’
novel, “Cricket on the Hearth"
will be produced prior to our
Yuletlde vacation on December
1 and 2. Mr. Kent Andrews will
direct a cast of twelve characA
tors in this typical Dickens
story. The basis is characteriza—
tlon and pathos blended with
comedy.

In March the Grinnell aud-
ience will View and bear a mi.
dltional Chinese medieval com-
edy, “Lady Precious Stream." In
this type of production there is
full use of the prop man on and
off stage during the poi-torn»
anoe.

Shaw's “Candida"

Winding up the season is an
arena production in the last
week at April and the first week'
in May. George Bernard Shaw's
six Character “Candida" may be
the probable choice for the sea-
.son’s finale.

The new ticket plan provides
for issuing reserved seats prior
to each performance. In the
past, most students hustled over
to the Treasurer's Office at the
last minute to grab the audience
tickets, or it late, the balcony
seats, When curtain time ap:
iproached. the horde would dcs<
Icend clutching their tickets and
.vie for the best seats. This year
