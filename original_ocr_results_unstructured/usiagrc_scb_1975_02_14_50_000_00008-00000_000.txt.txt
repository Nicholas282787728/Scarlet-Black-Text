Women are miraculous-

hy Dave Schechter

It was only fitting that the
Grinnell women's swim team
Should win the first annual Miracle
Relays. After all, it is nice when
the home team wins its own meet,
and the Miracle Relays were one of
the biggest iinilien’s collegiate
athletic events in the State, Still, it
took some excellent swimming
from the whole Mike Daley's team
right down to the wire to win the
meet.

Although both the University of
Nebraska and the University of
Northern Iowa stayed right at the
heels of the hometown Pioneer's
throughout, Grinnell and the
Cornhuskers grabbed eight iirsts
in nine relay events as each cops
ping four. All three contenders
began the iinai event, the 400-yard
free style, needing a first to win the
meet, This Grinnell did, building a
lead from the starting gun and
winning easily on Sheryl Huntoon’s
excellent 58,3 lODryard anchor leg.
That gaVe Grinnell 46 points, UNI
43, and Nebraska 42, Luther,
Augustana, and Graceland
followed in the six-team meet.

Swimming progressive distances
of 50-100-200-400 yards before the
packed and vocal gallery were
Becki Chipman, Marg Horstman,
Huntoon, and Mary Forsythe, as
this ioursome won the 750-yard
free relay, Gail Machala joined
Huntoon, Chipman, and Hostman
to combine for the win in the 100-
yard iree relay.

In the 30dyard butterﬂy relay
Jill Hoover. Bonnie Kenney, and
Virginia Munoz splashed home
with a “second victory margin.
Going into the final event Grinnell
and Nebraska were tied with 39
points and um had 38. Horstman,
Renee Reicharl. Forsvthe, and
Huntuon swam to a fiversecond win
over UNI.

Having won the traveling trophy,
the women deposited Daley in the
water, He didn't mind, since this is
getting to bc a habit With the team,
currently undefeated in four dual
meets. Overshadowed by this win

(Editors note: Perhaps the best
documentation of the reversal in
women's sports in Grinnell is
shown here. as we compare the 58:
3'5 treatment of the women's swim
team then and now. Following is a
write-up headed “Women
Swimmers Drop Two" which was

issue of the S 8: B.)

The Grinnell ﬁshes got off to a
great start by drowning the
Graceland girls in a swim meet
last semester. However, this
semester the University oi
Nebraska and Iowa State proved to
have faster fins. despite the ar-
duous workouts conceived by
Coach Kingfish.

On February 3 the “school”
traveled to Ames where they were
promptly beaten by the whales
from Nebraska and lowa State.
The highlight of the day was
Margaret Minnow’s graceful
gliding through the water in the 50-
yard iree-style which gave
Grinnell six of its 20 points. The
second highlight was Betty
Barracuda’s near second in the 50.
yard backstroke. Other fishes who
contributed their efforts are Gail
Goldfish, Ann Angelfish, Janet
Guitar-fish, Jill GuppY, Amelia
Angel-Shark, and Bonnie Bluefish.

A View from the bridge

by Peter Calvert

Paddleballers, handballers, and
squashers will have to watch what
they say when playing in four
wall courts one and two in the
physical education complex
APEC). A viewing deck has just
been completed overlooking these
hanbail courts.

The viewing deck consists of a
metal grill suspended from the rooi
beams of the PEG and attached to
the handball complexes. Sections
about 14' X 3’ have been removed
from the back walls of courts one
and two. These openings permit
observation of matches by up to
lwenlyiive fans,

Although the PEC'S original
design omitted spectator space
with the notable exception of the
swim area, John Pfitsch, director
of intercollegiate athletics, and
Richard Ullrlch, Assistant to the
President, both felt the need for
spectator access to the four wall
courts. Mr. ullrich, '33, a former
Iowa handball champion, con-
tacted Mrs. M, C. Frye, a long time
iriend, Mrs. Frye had previously
donated $20,000 for two handball
courts, one in the memory of her
deceased husband, Michael Frye,
'35, also a handball champion, and
the other in honor of Ullrich. Mrs.
Frye and her sons. Tom and Mike
generously'agreed to contribute

the additional $5,000 needed for the
viewing deck.

“The deck facilitates handball
instruction,” explained Tom
Latimer, College director of
recreation, Resident advisor and
avid paddleballer, Dick Vos,
commented, “It exposes people to
the game who have never seen or
played it and helps players im-
prove their game by watching
better players,”

Although one student objected to
being observed, the overall
response was positive. One unr
foreseen bonus, gleefully noted
freshman racquetballer Paul
Matecl-ri, is “the pretty cute-
looking girls up on the viewing
deck.”

MOUNT VERNON, 1A.—Losing
was the name of the game Friday
and Saturday for the Grinnell
basketballers as they extended
their winless streak to three. A

hopes of Ron Mitchell's cagers,

three teams. on February 6,
Grinnell fell to Kirkwood by a
score of 30-18, Scott Beers at 134,
Dan Mosby at 158, and Bo chosa

Genereux, Mosby, Engram,
Doneian, and deKosa all wrestled
well. With the exception of deRosa,
all the above lost again in the final

concerned with Men’s League play
as the Coed teams enjoyed a week
oi rest prior to the torrid,
tumultuous playoiis. Information
about the playoffs, which are now

exciting installment. We also have
a first to report- in this article,
namely the first 100 point team
toml for a game and the first over
40 point individual performance in
a single game. These tremendous
feats were pulled off by Younkers
and Mike Hopkins respectively.
