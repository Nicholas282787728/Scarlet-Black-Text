Ponca indian dance, which will be
iollowed by Shawn's fiist solo: the
Hopi Indian eagle dance.

Third is the “Sinhalese Devil
dance” done by Foster Fit2»Sim-
ons, Fred Howard and Horace
Jones. source material is derived
(mm the island of Ceylon, where
such dances are used to drive out
disease.

nnynlr Spear Dance

Next on the program is a Dayalr
spear dance in which the hunter
seeks game in the jungles of Bor—
neo, kills it, and dances about his
prey.

The second main section is cams
posed of 11 separate dances,
which express the universal emo-
tions of mankind iii contemplation
of four greet natureal phenomena:
strife, love. death, and the things
beyond death.

Seven numbers, including dances
of play and labor and art motifs,
make up the third group. It opens
with “Danza Afra-Cnb’d'na,” a
solardance by Shawn.

Spanish Atmosphere

The Spanish atmosphere is sus-
tained in “Cutting the ,Sugar
Cane” and “Los Embozados.“ The
latter, concerned with a dramatic
story of brigands and their treach-
ery, is danced by Shawn and four
of the company.

In direct contrast to the drama
of “Los Embozados” is the solo
phantasy "pier-rot in the Dead
City" danced by- Burton Mumaw.

The last three dances of this
section of the program, “A Dreier
Lithograph," “Mouvement Naif"
and "Dynamo," are abstract and
essentially modern in quality.
“Dynamo," the last dance of this
group, is done by the full ensem-
ble, and is a rhythmic portrait of
the machine and its great strength.

Final section

Religious dances compose the
final section of the program. The
first, “Mevlevi Dervish,” is done
with Shawn as soloist, while
“Brothers Bernard, Lawrence and
Masseo," three Franciscan monks,

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

typify three varieties of religious
experience in the second number.

“The Dance of the Redeemed,”
by eight men of the company, is
conceived in the mood of William
Blake's illustration to the book of
Job: “When the Sons of God
shouted together, and the Moi-ire
mg star-s sang for joy."

Shawn concludes the program
with three Negro spirituals. In
these familiar songs, the object
has been to preserve the rhythm,
the simple emotional abandon and
intensity, the childlike faith and
fervor, as well as the meaning of
the words of the songs.

Scarlet_s Win

(Continued from page 1)

The Scar-let's scored 13 points
in the first period. Livermore's
dash and High’s place kick ac-
counted for seven points. Later
in the period Pres Evans faded
back from the Black 30 and Cooke
ed a nice pass to Robinson who
gathered it in and rambled 15
yards for the counter. High mis-
sed the kick.

Following a series of fumbles
by Black, backfield in the second
quarter the Scarlets pushed down
to the 35 where Evans wound up
and heaved a short flat pass to
Jim Wallace. Wallace reversed

and the half ended 1570.

Bucks Reverse Form.

The Blacks showed a reversal
of for-m in the second half and
with l-iomann packing the leather
gained down to the one yard line.
Another fumble and the end of
the quarter ruined their chances.
Jones punted from behind his goal
and early in the last period EvV
ans threw a 30ryal'd pass to Carl
Blank, who made a nice running
catch behind the goal line. High
made the kick and the score was
26—0.

Lookabangh substituted freely
on both teams in the last eight
minutes with neither outfit show-
ing an advantage. The Black
team tried a desperate pass from
their own Sﬂryarrl line in an effort
to score. but Nash grabbed the
hall in the flat zone and scurried
across without any opposition.

the passing attack shown by both

Jim Wallace proved to be the
