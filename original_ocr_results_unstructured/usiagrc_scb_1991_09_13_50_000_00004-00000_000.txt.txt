Annual tutorial fever

Women’s leadership legacy praised

By Sharyn Obsarz

There‘s an enormous legacy for a
woman today," said Carole Leland,
kicking off the Women in Leadership
Symposium with her lecture last
Wednesday night

Leland, who spoke on "Women
as Leaders: Reﬂecting a Passion for
Change," described the making of
this legacy of women's leadership,
chamcterizing it as a time of "a lot of
emotion, alot of pleasure, and a lot of
pain."

In tlte 1950‘s, she said, people be»
gan asking if women could be lead-
ers. The difﬁculty was access.

"Continuing education programs
for women began, initiated by re-
spected visible individuals who
opened the way for women," said
Leland, who calls tltese individuals
"predecessors."

The feminist movement began in
the 1960's, Leland said. "Women be-
gan to get their act togethe ey did
a lot of consciousness raising."

The 70's "produced some impor-
tant structures," she said, including a
new feminist language, the feminist
press, conferences, and legislative
gains.

In the 80's, "the statistics looked
much better," said Leland. There had
been some enormous changes al-
though many problems still existed,

"All of those changes over the

decades didn't just happen; they hap
pened because of the leadership of a
group of women," said lelandr

"These were women who had a
tremendous ability to get women
together...willing to admit they
couldn‘t do it all themselves...who
had passion which enabled them tobe
leaders in a time of enormous resis-
tance,"

"These were not women of an-
other planet, they are people just like
us," inspired by their friends, fami»
lies. coworkers and professors, she
said.

According to Leland, organiza-
tions today are looking for women's
style of leadership, which shecharac-

terized as geared toward coalition-
buillding, cooperation instead of com-
petition, and inclusiveness.

"Now the question is not whether
women can lead or should lead," said
Leland. "The question is 'will women
leadT"

Leland received her Ph. D. from
Stanford University and is currently
the Senior Program Associate for the
Centerfor CreativeLeadership in San
Diego. She has co-wn'tten a book
featuring interviews with leaders of
the feminist movement,

Her talk was sponsored by the
Women’s Alliance and the Donald L.
Wilson Program in Leadership and
Enterprise.

returns to Grinnell

By Julie Pecaut

——___
“What’s your tutorial?” Themost
frequently-asked question among
ﬁrst—year students, this inquiry in;
vitcs one to take a deeper look at the
tutorial system at Grinnell. What is
the tutorial, and what does itmean for
Grinnell students and professors?
First, it is necessary to know a few
facts. Required for graduation, the
tutorial is the only curriculum re-
quirement at Grinnell. In the class, a
group of about 1014 firstrycar stu-
dents meet twicea week toexplore an
interdisciplinary subject. writc papers,
and learn library and computer skills.
Studentscanchoosefromawiderange
oftoptcs,including"SovietWomen."
"The Future of Health Care in
America." "African-American Auto»
biography," and "Images of the Arab."
Most tutorial professors, however,
agree that the subject itself is not the
most important part of the tutorial.
George Barlow, who teaches “Afri-
can-American Autobiography,“ said,
“The tutorial must be particularly
functional,emphasizingprocessmore
than product. As faculty members. I
think we should continue to try to
resist the impulse to delve too deeply
into the content of the tutorial at the
expense of practtcal skill."

New language professor serious about Chinese studies

By Karen Nutter

____—

“Give a man aﬁsh toeat, and soon
his hunger will return. Teach him to
ﬁsh, however, and he will never be
hungry again" Asimple proverb per-
haps, but to David Keenan, the new
Assistant Professor of Classical and
East Asian languages, it reﬂects an
entire philosophy of teaching.

“I teach students to teach them»
selves,” Keenan explained. “I teach
Chinese [so as to] equip people to go
into that culture and understand it .r
both as an insider and an outsider. It
beneﬁts them“ ,opens their eyes." He
believes Grinnell studens, “non-pas-
sive" and “well-prepared" students
that they are, will beneﬁt especially
from this method of teaching

Keenan himself is wellrprepared
forthis position. Educated in intcma-
tional schools until he reached col~
lege age, he attended Damnouth Uni-
versity to obtain his BA and then
spent time studying in J apan before
attending graduate school at Harvard
University. He graduated with a PhD.
from Harvard, and spent several years
doing sabbatical replacementwork at
various schools.He eventually settled
at Colby College, where he taught
before coming to Grinnell.

Keenan came to Grinnell partially
because he missed the Midwest. He
was born in Indiana and. after twenty
years of teaching on the East Coast,
he was ready to retum to this region.
Mainly, however, he came in pursuit
of an administration which takes study

of the Chinese language seriously.
Colby, he stated, “didn't have the
commitment.".Hebelieves,however,
that Grinnell, with itsstrong lan guagc
program and firmsupportof language
houses, does take the study seriously.

Keenan said his aim is to help
students become competent enough
to understand China, and therefore
become more atune with their own
cultures, and how others view them.
Getting students to this potntis some-
times difficult, and even frustrating;
adjustments mustbemadewithevery
student according to his or her own
individual level of learning in order
to make the student comfortable. It is
gratifying, he insisted, when students
begin developing tastes and opinions,
and when they begin to share with

him information and ideas they dis»

Keenan expressed some concern
over the fact that some students are
not involved with the Chinese law
guageprogrambecauseoftheBeijing
student massacre. This past July, he
travelled to China after not having
visited in three years and found rer
forms which, he insisted, most likely
came from the politics and demon-
strations surroundtng the events in
Tienamen Squares For instance, a
book which he was not allowed even
to view on his previous visit was now
available in bookstores, and there was
evidence of some disposiblc income
in lhekinds ofgoods sold by the street
merchants.

Expectations, Kcnnan explained,
mustbc kept low to appreciate these
reforms,butthings arcslowly chang-
ing, and students should notallow the
horrible events of the past to inﬂu-
ence them from learning about such a
rich culture.

 

necessary tosucccssful college work,
according to professors. “It assures
the student at least one small class in
his or her freshmen ycar. It assures
that each student has an advisor who
knows his orhcr workand has him or
her in class, and itallows the teacher
to spot and solve student problems,"
said Kathy Karnp, who teaches ”Imr
ages of the Arab.“

Fortunately, most Student expec-
tations echo the professors' percepr
tions of the tutorial. In contrast to the
less subjectcriented professors, how-
ever, the students find themselves
first attracted to the subject of the
tutorial itself.

The tutorial must be
particularly functional,
emphasizing process
more than product.

Elizabeth Sellick, whose tutorial
is “Soviet Women," said, “Since I
couldn’t take a Russian language
course, [the tutorial] was a good op
portunity to have some sort of class
related to Russia. We are reading
books about women’s roles in the
Soviet Unionihow they view them-
selves and how thegovernmcntviews
them. It's very interesting to read
about how different their lives rcally
arefromours,andin someways.how
s1mtlar.”

Students see the tutorial not only
asan opportunity to study an interest-
ing subject, but also as a way of
easing the transition to collcgc-levcl
work “The tutorial allows freshman
to become adjuSted to college in a
stress~frce environment,“ said Jesse
Kane.

Despiteallthesebenefits,arethere
problems Willi the tutorial system?
Most professors and students found
little wrong with the system, but they
admitted that it does not always func-
tion perfectly.

“Notevery tutorial willreally fuﬁil
all its purposes, since there are so
many," said Ms, Kamp. “It ends up
almosrtoo fullithere'ssomuchbag-
gage that it‘s hard to fit it all in.“

With all its complexities, benefits,
and problems, the tutorial system re-
mains part ofthe continuing quest for
a liberal education.
