PROF. PECK GIVES
COLLEGE HISTORY

College Blessed With Three Help.
fill Disasters.

The history of Gl'innell was told
by Professor Paul F. Feck to the gl'ls
of the Freshmen class in the little
theatre Tuesday evening.

Professor Peck traced the develop-
ment of Grinnell College from the time
it was known as the Iowa College at
Davenport to its present standing.

“Grinnell College,” he said, "has
been blessed with three helpful dis—
asters; the ﬁrst, the trouble which
arose at Davenport and Which caused
the Iowa. College to come here; see;
cold, the burning of the East College,
and last, the cyclone of June 17, 1582.
I do not see why these should not
be termed helpful disasters since they
attracted the interest of the public
and sent a. thrill of sympathy through
the nation, the result of which en—
abled the College to replace its losses
many times."

Library Adds 'Books
of Famous Cartoons

Among the new hooks in the library
are two volumes of the War Cartoons
of Louis Raemaekers, Holland’s fam-
our artist—journalist. The two hun—
tired cartoons shown compose one of
the most powerful denunciations ever
made against German cruelties, ac—
cording to the late Theodore Roosev
velt. Raemaokers was the greatest
cartoonist of the world and his in-
ﬂuence was so feared 15y Germany that
she offered a reward equal to $5,000
for his_ capture.
