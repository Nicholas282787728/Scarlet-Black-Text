are at
the cititlct

The wearers of spikes
last hard at work on
path. A goodly number of candi-
dates lorhonors of tracl: and ﬁeld
are tnt'ull ttaining. These need
no word btit ol encouragement,
but so those who are still unde-
cided a bit of advice cannot come
amiss. It you dont go into
sortie branch of athletics now,
you will be sorry before you
graduate. How much athletics
means to a college cannot be (as
ttmatcd. Nothingin the college
llfL! alouses such enthusiasm. Men
for thc vaiioitstraclr events must
train and practice asin any other
work and this is a place where
the right sort of \volk counts
every time.

The events of a college ﬁcld
meet rcquiie speed and strength,
endurance and skill, but these are
quatitres which are developed,
not gained atone stride. The
variety in the nature of the track
events makes necessary a team
composed of men at dtfferent
abilities. No differencewhat may
be an athlete's special skill there is
always some event when: it can
be used to advantage. And no
clirrerenee what may be their
physical eoncliiron in the bee
ginning, nirletyrninc out ot every
ireslrrnen who enter college can

Uniting. And cvery man should be

willing to do at least that much cl

forhts Alma Mater. There are
sixteen dih‘ercntcvcnts, and three
places to be won in every one ot
them. Every man has a chance.
In a low short tt'eaks the contests
ot speed and skill and strength
torlolt‘aCollcge will begin ancl
every man should contribute his
share lowzird melting them s‘uCr
cesslul.

 

. r
The successtul track team tnust‘

have good men'tor evcry event.
and cannot win by a few stars in a
few events. Grinnell must have
men for all events. Our team now
is weak In several places. Pattie

larly in tht: weights and pole
vault there are apparently
strong candidates out. There are
{man in school who can throw the
weights or vault and they should
be training new, Mcn who do
not expect to mate the team this
year should at least come out and
gain the development and experr
ience, That will help them give
better support to the scarlet and
black when the strong men of the
present team are gone. The old
team cannot be depended upon al
ways, but new men must constant-
Iy be developed and constant adr
ditions must be made to the team
to ﬁll the places of those who will
soon leave the school by gradtlar
tioii or otherwise.

SENIOR CLUB.

The Senior Girls’ Club had an
unusually pleasant meeting Satr
urday afternoon when they met
at the home of Emma Valleau on
Broad St The afternoon was
spent in sewing and conversation
and visiting with the twoold mcm-
bers who were present. About
ﬁvco'clock the boys began
come in response to the hostess
tnvitation,and soon after all were
asked to ﬁnd their places at the
tables. This was very interesting,
for wits had to be set at warh-
puzzle out the names which were
cvcrly represented in the iebus
form and painted in waters
colors on the cards. An elegant
three course luncheon was served.
the colors of the class being the
color scheme [or the tables. Attcr
luncheon till tornralityw s tlrroun
aside and a class business meet-
ing indulged in to decidc upon the
class play. All had a splendid
llml: as only 1903 can, and voted
Miss Vttllcau a cllntnltng hostess.
