Friday. November l3I I959

Grinnell's football team suf—
fered its seventh loss of the
1959 season at the hands of
Ripon last weekend.

In a game played on a ﬁeld

that was sloppy and slippery

With halfrmelted Snow, the P10-

 
   

neers and their opponents were . '

almost evenly matched, There
were two important exceptions;
a pass int eeption by Ripon
deep in Grinneil territory and

a long scoring dash by Redman '

fullback Ken Fedor.

The game started slowly
with the two teams maneu-
vering carefully at midiield
nnd'exohanging punts. Grin-
neil once caught a Ripon punt
receiver back on his own tour-
yard line but lost its advan-
tage when the Redmen drove
to midﬁeld before being stop-
ﬂed.

Bob Woito returned Ripon’s
kick to his own 19, but his ﬁrst
.own pass bounced off his re
c'ejver’s shoulder pad and into
the waiting arms of a Ripon
defender, Though the Pioneers
held to take the ball on downs,
(may never got out oi their own
backyard, and a few minutes
later, a Ripon back took a punt
back to the Grinnell 35. From
glue the Redmen ground into
the end zone in seven quick
plays as Dick Celichowski
plunged over irom the threee
vard line. George sievers kicked
or the extra point, and Grinnell
trailed by 770.

Ripon seemed to take heart}

out; These reached the Grinnell
:7 and sixry'ard lines but were
stopped by Ripon fumbles, .

’ In the second half, Grinnell
contained its opponent‘s attack

'almost periectly. Ripon never
had the ball for more'than
foul- downs at a time and was
ioroed to punt on every series
except one.

. The one time no punt was
needed was when, on ﬁrst down,

en Fedor found a hole at left
tackle, cut to the outside and
sprinted down the sidelines for
a stunning 54-yard touchdown
day, Sievers’ kick was short

is time, but the game was all

It out of reach for the Pio-
nears. ’ n n.

p Grimell fought back to un—
leash an air attack that account—
-d for well over 100 yards in
the second half. With Waite
throwing to his favorite targets,
Bob Rikkers and Jim Simmons,
the Pioneers initiated drives of
43, 39 and 37 yards during the
third and iourth periods.

Grime“ marchﬂd inside the
Redman 3t) twice, only to have
interceptions halt both threats
The game ended with the Pio-
neeI-s 0n the march at the
Ripon 32.

Highpoint of the game from
a Grinnell standpoint was the
passing attack, Woito’s arm ac—
counted for 181 air yards,_a
ew one-game record for Grin-
nell, to go with his season com-
pletion and yardage marks, Sim.
mons, with 3l receptions, broke
that school record While hls
running mate at end, Rikkers,

Though the Grinnell footballl

team was shy on the victory
side with a 1.7 record, it was
a big-season tor the Pioneers
in the record book,

Most new Grinncll marks
were achieved through the
passing of (ho-captain Bob
Woito and the receiving oi
junior endsulim- Simmons and
Bob Rikkers.

Woito. a senior playing quar-
terback and throwing for the
first time this season, launched
159 passes and completed 77 for
7'78 yards and four touchdowns.

His totals exceeded the old
records or Its passes, 47 com-
pletions and 525 with set by
John Copeland in 1958. Woiw’s
181 yards against Bipon in
last week's finale also set a
one-game yardage record.

In the pass»catching depart-
ment. Simmons gathered
record number of 31 tosses
while Rikkers caught 29, both
bettering the old record. Rik-
keIrs was the leader in yard-
age with 3I7 yards while Sim-
mons‘ total of 270 was also
greater than the previous mark.

Grinnell’s rushing leader
was John Harnmg, who set a
new groundegaining standard
for sophomores by picking up
487 yards in 146 carries. He
also led in scoring with 42
points, I
