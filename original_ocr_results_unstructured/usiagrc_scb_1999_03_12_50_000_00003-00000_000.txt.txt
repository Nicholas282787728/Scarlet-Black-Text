What meaning does the word,
“escape," hold for you? Do you
think of a jail break? A means of
avoiding a near»dcath experience?
Circumventing a blind date (oops.
I know this is Grinnell. Just thought
I'd add that one out of posterity)?
Or maybe an escape is something
much simpler than all of those
things. Maybe all it involves is a cat,
a couplt of cassette tapes. and the
open road. ’Maybe escape simply
means getting the heck out of
Grinnell.

we all feel the burning desire to
escape once in awhile. You just
know that ifonly you could get past
the boundaries of the campus, the
town, or even the state ofiowa, you
would once again gain the small re.
maining shreds of sanity and dig»
nity that seem to have evaporated
while you were reading the not-so-
stellar comments written on your
last history paper. The signs hang-
ing up in the dining halls and post
ofﬁcc are a testament to our need

like that,
So why do we txpcriencc those
’ moments?\Vliy do we feel the need
to get out oFGrinncll?
I think that one reason has to
«do with sclfesteem. Seriously. lust
hear mi: out. Think about whether
this scenario is familiar: you frel as
though everyone else is being a
thousand times more productive
than you. You know that if you
could escape for a couple ofliouts.
you would once again be yourhard-
working self, ready to tackle Or»
ganic chemistry, Trads II and For
litical Theory all in one night. En-
ergy would flow through you veins,
you’d become an academic ma-
chine, grad schools all over [he
countrywould vie for your presence
in their classrooms, ’
Honestly, though, the doldrums
known as the Grinnell College
spring semester simply beg for
someone to bust into your room.
grab you by the collar and drag you
offto Never Never Land. Suddenly,
the library is no longer an edifice
housing a world of knowledge at
'yuur fingertips; it's merely that big
grey building that mocks you every
single time you walk up the ramp
wearing your impossibly full back-
pack. The thermostat is usually set
at a subarctic temperature, and to
add insult to iniury, Burling is al<
ways full ofreally loud people with
great social lives who are still get-
ting better grades than you. Yet an-
other reason to escape.
Well, okay Lets say you take die
plunge and leave campus for awhile.

You go to lowa Cityot Dos Moincs
for a couplc of hours. Try as you
might to gut some reading done in
the car, you end up either sick to
yourstomach nrso engrossed iii the
Iowa sccncry that any hope ofeoin-
plcting the one hundred pages of
Chaucer you were assigned ﬂies
right out the proverbial Window.

And then you arrive at your des-
tination. You run around for awhile,
taking in the sights, doing some
shopping, and playing the role ofa
relatively normal human beingwith
a life (to the best of your ability).
You're relaxed, happy; you tealirc
that your friends would barely rec-
ognite you. Then you load up and
head back.

Now, the funny thing is that
when I return to Grinnell, I feel like
I haven't Seen everyone for about
five years when in reality it’s been
approximately five hours. Maybe
that’s why we feel an urgent need
to escape. We're suffocating each
other. And not in a necessarily bad
way. We're simply all togcthtr all of
the time. We can‘t even have the
bathrooms all to ourselves. In a
sense, we've become each other's
families and we all know that we
just need, really need to escape from
our families sometimes.

All told, an escape is an event
of the utmost necessity for the
Grinnell College Student. it helps
us to regain our self-esteem, to
stop hating random buildings and
strangers, and to place a barrier
between our friends and ourselves
that wt: all need every now and
then.

With escape, we become tee
made until the next time we’re
overcome by the urge.

Let’s Just Build a Moot

There comes a time in each
scnior’s career when he takes a
look at the school around him,
remembers the good old days of
years gone by and laments the
direction in which the school is
heading. It’s inevitable,,so please
don’t consider me too much of
a geezer as I describe how much
more pleasant this school was
when I was a freshman.

Walking along the South
campus loggia with all the en»
trance doors propped wide
open, 1 could have passed be-
tween dorms in astraightiacket.
The Night watch people, the
only security officers we knew
in those days, scurried around
after 10:00pm in their dingy
blue polo Shirts closing all the
doors, only to have them
propped open again five min»
utes later. These folks were as in»
conspicuous as possible, practie
cally blushing from embarrass
ment whenever they encounr
tercd a student on their rounds.
What passed for a concern
about security back then was
wondering whether or not you
should lock your room over
winter break.

when I was recounting
thcsc happy days to Steve
Briscoc, Gtinnell's ﬁrst Director
or Security, he practically fell
out ofhis chair. He said, “The
problem with thatkind ofthing
is that you risk a lot of Iiabil»
ity.” Ah, yes. Liability. I suppose
Grinncll had to enter modern
times at some point, but would
we really sacrifice such a peace»
ful atmosphere for a few legal
Concerns?

To this question Tom Crady,
Vice President and Dean for
student Affairs, responds, “For
me liability wasn’t the real is-
sue," and, honestly, I tend to
believe him. I would love [0 sit
here and tall against the admin-
istration for beefing up security
unnecessarily just to gain a few
rungs on the college rankings
ladder, but that’s not the case.
1'm not saying that liability is»
sues and trustee pressure did not
play some kind or role, but
there's no conspiracy at work
hcre. The sad truth is that we
did this to oursclvcs.

Our keycard system was
implemented and our Security
Omcc was created amidst wide-

DUSTIN GOOT

spread clamor from students
about the need for more secu-
rity at Grinnell. When Grinnell
was interviewing for a new
president, students wanted to
know what candidates would do
about security. Yes, securityl In
Grinnell, Iowa! The same
Grinnell, Iowa, which had its
first murder in over twenty years
a couple ofwceks ago!

Walking
along the
South
Campus
Ioggia with
all the
entrance
doors
propped
wide open, I
could have
passed
between
dorms in a

straigh tjacke t.

Of course, anyone who was
here two years ago knows what
prompted this change in stu
dent attitude. There was a Sexual
assault that spring which
shocked everyone, especially
when reports came out impli»
caring a serial rapist. it‘s under
standable to think about Secu—
rity during such a limo, How-
ever, oven after police ruled out
the possibility ofa serial rapist
and the student accused in the
matter. a senior, gladuatcd and
left Grinnell, students were still
paranoid about their security.

As horrible theseitual assault
may have been, it did not reveal
any overlooked safety needs at
Grinnell. Actually, there has
been at least one report of forc-
iblc rape every year since 1992.

when the college began keeping
crime statistics. Unfortunately,
rapes sometimes occur at col»
legcs e even Grinnell. Besides
that, the security measures the
college has implemented do not
make it any less likely that a stu.
dent will assault another stu—
dent, sexually or otherwise, in
the future. Probably the biggest
effect of the changes has been
the shortage of dining services
workers, as everyone leaves for
security staff.

it may sound like I’m against
security at Grinnell. i’m not. To
their credit Dean Crady and CV»
eryone involved with the ore
ation ofour security office have
said they want it to bc,.above all
else, a service to students, and
they seem to be doing a good
job. Just ask Emilie Beavers “01,
who sat on the student Security
Committee last semester.
“There was some resentment
when they were ﬁrst putting in
the security office, but it has re—
ally died down,” she says. In
fact, Briscoe himself had to calm
down students, recently when
theywcre demandinga24ehour
lock-down in response to the
murder.

Though I cringe when
Briscoc tells me he wants to cre-
ate a learning environment for
students Interested in law en-
forcement, I appreciate his ef»
forts to integrate his office with
the campus culture. says Julian
Zcbot ’00, student head of Se»
curity, “He’s pretty concerned
with how Students View Sccur
rity."

The reason i liked the (tip
patently) non»secu re days ofmy
freshman year is not that I was
too lazy to open the doors. i
liked that we were expected to
act like adults and take care of
ourselves. I worry that creating

a security “presence” on campus

will necessarily erode the attie
tude of personal responsibility
that Grinnell has traditionally
nurtured. Already Dean crady
says that students are reporting
more crime incidents, and,
though he does not attribute this
increase to a lack ofsclf—rcliance,
icannot help feeling that when
the college decided bowed to
demands for more security, it
lost a part ofits spirit in the pro
cess,

in Woody Allen‘s Airing Hill,
Alvy Singer ﬁnds liirnselfata party
brimming with iiitclltctunls and
acddcmics who endlessly babble
“dissent" and “comiiitntary," which
Alvy dubs “dysentery." Alvy grows
rircd ofinaking “fake insighrs"wirh
the group and quietly escapes to
watch the Knicks battle the Cava»
liers on the television.

His exrwifc storms into the bed-
room and indignantly says, "Herc
you arc. There’s people out there."

“Hey," Alvy replies, "you
wouldn'tbelicvcthis. Twominutts
ago, the Knicks art: ahead fourteen
points, and now. . . now' theyUrc
ahead two points,"

“Alvy, what is so fascinating
about a group ofpituitary cases trye
ing to stuff the ball through a
hoop?"

“What’s fascinating is that its
physical. You know, it’s one thing
about intellectuals, they prove that
you can be absolutely brilliant and
have no idea wharUs going on. But
on the other hand, the body doesn't
lie, as-as we now know." Pulling his
ex-wifc on the bed, Alvy proceeds
to put on the proverbial moves.

His wife, somewhat disgusted,
pulls away and says, “Alvy don't:
Youute using scx to express hostil-
ity.“ Alvy responds: “Why-why do
you always reduce my animal utgcs
to psychoanalytic categories?"

As spring threatens to break
winters stifling hold on the cam.
pus, students are taking heed. We.

BY BRENDAN FLAHERTY

like Alvy, are feeling tho nod to get
in touch with our “animal urges."
w.- are feeling the need to distance
ourselves from our academic lives
in favor ofsomething more physi.
cal, more concrete, more pure.
And many ofus, iust like Alvy,
have turned to basketball. on the
national level, the NCAA tourna»
ment is widely watched and, more
significantly. in Darby Gymnasium
Grinntllians art hitting the courts
in near record numbers for this
year's student intramural (51) has»
ketball season. With spring break
rapidly approaching, almost every
student has an increased workload:
nevertheless, every Monday and
Wednesday a solid group of over
forty students have been sacriﬁcing
mluable time to play hoops. This
common sacrifice along with the
spirit and comradcte of the game
has already forged a sense ofcom-
munity among everyone involved.
The games are not played just
for fun, however. Depending on
how a team or a player approaches
51 basketball, the competition can
vary between cut-throat and casual.
some are out towinwhile some are
there merely for the experience. In
either case, on the court players are
free to openly compete, to express
the will to win, to infuse the game
with a high intensity and to raise
the stakes. Coming from an aca-
demic life where the emphasis is on
non-confrontation and politically
correct language and behavior, such

a raw expression of “animal urges”
and nfphysicality, is decidedly re-
freshing. There is no denying that
making a basket, even iftaking the
game lightly, is exhilarating. it is a
clear, unquestionableachievement.
Likewise, winning a game is defi-
nite success, the attainment of the
agreed upon goal.

unlike regular pickup basketball
games where the players call their
own fouls, in Si games there is a ref
tree. Therein lit-s one of the few
problems with die SI system. There
is only one referee and it is impos.
siblc for him to sec the whole floor.
Both sides then have the incentive
and ability to commit more fouls
than they would in a pick-up game,
Also, in pickvup hoops, where play.
ers have more equal skill levels and a
more similar approach to the game,
there is usually little deviation among
the players as to what should be called
a foul and what should not. In SI
basketball, however, teams can havc
radically different ideas of how the
rules should be interpreted. For SI
basketball to work properly, for the
rules to keep the game going
smoothly teams must concentrate on
what they have in common: the sac»
rifice oftimet the desire to get disr
rancc from academia, the need to ex:
press “animal urges." '

For those students who instead
of, or in addition to playing 5] base
kcrball, choose to go to Disco tomor-
rOW, the same idea must be kept in
mind.

 

 

 

Computers from page 1
should be assigneda number allcda DNS
address, which ldcntiﬂes the Computcr.

The residential network was found to
be unable to handle more than 270 com
putets. From the 271“ onward, comput-
ers were not assigned DNS numbers.

This hindered computer use for many
users because a number ofinternrt pro.
grams require DNS numbers to verify the
identity of die user. The ability to send
mail off campus, enter secured internet
sites and nineertain software, for cxnrnplti
all require DNS numbers.

will be evaluated. It is unlikely diat a fix
will be available for students until next

Pifer. “My priorities for the rest of die
