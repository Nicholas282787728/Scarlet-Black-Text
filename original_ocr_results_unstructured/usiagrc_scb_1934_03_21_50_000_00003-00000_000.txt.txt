Campus Opinions

Question: should comprehensive
examinations be scheduled ahead oi
the regular cxanuuatious?

JACK PEOPLES: Yes. it would
give seniors in break by letting us
have more time to get our back work
straightened out after the exami-
nation.

MARGUERITE PILGRIM: Yes.
Seniors are especially busy the latter
part of the year applying for posi-
tions and it would be well to have
the examinations over.

KING PARK: No. I see no good
reason except that lt’would he a good
excuse to catch up on sleep it is bet»
ter to keep us busy until the end of
,lhe year.

PAUL CRAWFORD: Yes: In our
petition, some of the reasons we gave
were: It would give seniors time to
apply for positions; we would not be
taking examinations while other
students were having theirs and leav»
ing school: if a student failed his
comprehensive he would have enough
time to study for it a second time;
seniors would have a chance to take
examinations in some of this year's
subjects to strengthen their grades;
and we would have a chance to
straighten out any work which has
been incomplete.

GASTON SANTI: 1 see no reason
why they should he changed, We all
need the time to study for the com-
‘prehensives.

JANET WRIGHT: 1 have been ap-
proached both ways and 1 helieve the
points in the petition win my favor.

places peace above nationalism were

sites for disarmament.

Although he admitted that the
world is not ready for control by an
international organization, the speaks
er insisted that the beginnings of such
institutions must he kept alive,
for “the world is lost if we go back
to the anarchy of 1914. The refusal
of the United States to join the
World court and the League of Nan

danger today."

Tuesday

A resume of Grinnell basketball
was given by John c, Truesdalc, di-
rector of athletics, as he presented
basketball and swimming letters,
"The first varsity team was in 1901
and Grinncll played three games," he
recalled,

“From that time until 1917, the
Grinnell teams won more games than
were lost. After that there was no
team that won more games than
were last until this year. Santi and
Manns have the distinction of play-
ing on the best team in 17 years "

Coach Truesdale called attention to
the 1510-11 and 1912-13 seasons as
the only undefeated years.

"Both the-men's and Women's tell»
