hurdles in the final Olympic tryouts
in Boston. This record he later tied
in the winning the Olympic event
over a field of the world’s greatest
hurdlers. In London and in Dublin. he
was on winning relay teams, and at
the latter games, he won the 4004
meter hurdles and the 400-meter run.
Upon his return to the United states.
he established a new U, S. record in
the A. A, U. championships. He cap-
tained the Grinnell track squad in
1925.
In 1928 after graduation Taylor?
once again won a place on the Olym-
pic team and this time finished sec—
ond to Lord Burghley. English star. l
in the Amsterdam stadium. Thisl
year sport followers did not regardl
him as a serious contender because‘
of his age. but he nevertheless pulled}
a gallant comeback to win his wayl
through sectional, district, semi inal.;
and final tryouts. He will remain in'
Los Angeles with the American team.’

both hurdle races. the 440, and on re»

roomed with Taylor in Rawson hall.‘
and who is now an associate in the‘
department of public relations. says.
“Taylor was a nervous. high~strung
chap. and it was seldom that he slept
before an important race Althoughl

‘he wasn't. what we would call a star,

he was the greatest all-around track
athlete Grinnell ever had." Lester
Duke, present Grinnell track mentor.
also asserts that Taylor stands head
and shoulders above the lengthy list
of great athletes who have worn the
scarlet and black. which includes such
names as Doc Huff, Chuck Hoyt.
