Manian calls for return of Shah

interviewed by John Mandel

Even with the present crisis in iraii,
that country may still seem remotely
removed from the academic world at
Grinnell. Yet, for at least one student,
the Iranian situation is of crucial con-
cern, due to his allegiance there.

Seventeenryeainold freshman Reza
Khadjenouri has been in this country
since 1977. He was born in Tehran,
Iran and was educated in a French
school. Khadjenouri attended a subur-
ban Kansas City high school upon his
arrival in this country, and has lived
here with guardians.

He is presently classified as “F-l,”
or on a student visa. Even though a
more stringent ruling was enacted
stating that all Iranian students in the
United States must report to immigra-
tion authorities by December 30. prov-
ing they are attending classes, Khad»
jenouri sees no problems affecting his
visa, which must be renewed in 1981

Khadjenouri agreed to answer a
number of questions pertaining to
Iran, including the holding oi hostages
by Iranian students and the question
of whether the shah should he returns
ed to Iran.

5&5: How do you View the situation in
Iran?

Khadjenour’ I think that what the
students did violates international law
and there is no excuse for it The
Americans in the embassy are innu»
cent; however, the students knew this
was the only way to get the shah back.
This problem was the worst way possi-
ble because their action and their
demands involves a chain of other face
tors, such as the damaged pride and
image oi America. probably they did
not sense how important an issue it
could become. They want the shah
back tor the many damages and sufs
ierings that Iranians hold him respon-
sible for.

In terms of well being of lranians,
the shah had done much to improve
the economy and made Iran semi-
industrialized, but healso destroyed
lranian sovereignty, he took away
freedom, and he destroyed national
products, such as Iarming, by impors
ting foreign foodstuffs and selling
them ior a cheaper price.

Iranian students and the thinking
class have always been iearing oi and
threatened by the shah's policies,
SAVAK, ior example.

The shah disrupted religious
ideologies and ways of living, anger-
ing religion-conscious people and the
clergy. The Iranians are making
towards setting a religious state, not to
go back to'medieval times but to

November )6, 1979

destroy the corruption that has set in
during the shah's regime and because
of the strong religious beliefs of the
people. However, an Islamic state
does not mean primativeness. It is in
the iavor oi evolution, progress, and,
in this case, modernization.

5&8: What about the demonstra-
tions here?

Ktiudjcliolii'i: lranians who have
come to the United States in the past
were escaping the shah's regime, as
well as seeking an education.
Freedom in the United States and
Europe was a way to work {or the
liberation of Iran and toward reaching
a democratic state. But demonstrar
tions were to make ioreign countries

the help of the shah.

Many millionaires have lost their
houses and cars and things they
couldn’t take with them. However,
most aren’t even in Iran and have
taken a great percentage oi their
wealth with them. Khomeini favors
the well-being of the common man and
the revolution was committed mainly
by those people, In the Constitution,
there Wasn’t a prediction for the
Kurds~people who taught for their
autonomy for centuries, and after
World War I] there was a distribution
oi states between Iran, Iraq, and
Turkeyiwhlch caused them to use
this opportunity ior demanding an
autonomous state.

“I hope the shah will be

taken back and conflicts

between the countries ended and

the hostages released unharmed.”

 

aware oi their ideals and what the
shah was doing. Demonstrations now
are purely addressed to the American
government and not the lranian
government,

SM}: What position do you believe
the Unitcd States should take?

Klindjenoiiri: I think the United
States should understand how the case
oi the shah is diiierent irom other per
sons who come to the United states ior
non-political reasons. The shah
deserves to be given back to the lra-
nian people, However, I don’t blame
them lUnited States citizenst ior reac-
ting, since it will not be good ior the
United States' image I favor America
returning the shah,

ssh: How do you compare the shah
and Khomeini?

Khudjcllouri; The shah wanted to
turn lran back to the old ways oi Irar
nian greatness and he wasn't for the
common person, One percent or the
Iranian population owned 35% of
Iran’s wealth, which they spent in
Europe. Now, khorncini is con
iiscating the wealth oi people he
think: have reached that status with

Khomeini has said a religous
government which was elected (some
educated people are not in favor oi a
religious theocracy, but instead, a
democracy) does not trespass Islamic
law. The present religious government
could have been more efficient in
economic terms, Since they weren’t, a
few intellectuals were unhappy, but
the maj ity at people are in iavor oi
Khomei .

what he has done is_not based
ed on a religious conviction, but his
leadership responsibility is to take a
stand and to see that the shah is tried
and Iranian wealth is returned.

8815: What are your feelings on the
present CriS|S7

Khadjenouri: I just hope that it will
ﬁnish as last as possible, and
peaceiully. i hope the shah will be
taken back and conflicts between the
countries ended and the hostages
released unharmed. I don't think the
hostages will be harmed if there are
no unpredicted happenings, such as
military action. I think the shah will
leave voluntarily {or another country.
