How disco came to be

"VVe,THE MEN VVI'lO STUFF THEIR
CROTCHES, with the support of SGA,
would like to declare. .DISCO WEEK'l‘"

Evel wondered ‘why Disco is held in
March.> Me neither, but as the Feb. 3, 1991
edition of the SE58 elucidates, it hasn’t always
been that way.

A group ororudeuts
informally known as
the Disco men caused
a controversy that week
when they sneeess-
fully lobbied for SGA
to pass ‘The Disco
Resolution,‘ instating a
week-long bonanza or
discorthcmed activities culminating in what
we today might recognize as the traditional
Disco Hams party.

The resolution sported a tonguerinrcheek
attitude, stating “Where As those of us who
ﬁnd some perverted thrill rn wearing polyester
are a minority on campus."

However, some students on campus. and
particularly Concerned Black Students (CBS),

week during Black History Month, CBS is-
sued a statement 5‘ ing “We find Disco Vl’eclc
offensive because it is not a celebration, bur
rather a parody ofdisco; a phenomenon whieh
involved mainly people oreolor, as well as gays
and lesbians." CBS spokesperson Marie Myers
felt that Disco VVeclt’s
parody ofBlack History

tloning or Disco, now eomtortaoly enseoneed
in Mare-h, represents the singular ability or
Grinnclltans to be both sensitive to racial and
other minority concerns, yet allow students
to “make humor of Grinncll students" and
the politically correct events that “both the
Grinncll students and the Disco guys engage
in."i\nd that. kids, Is why Disco is in hlarch.

Not in high school anymore Website induces extreme hate I hope you wished your hands

rants

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words or fewer,
and you’re invited]
If you have a rant;
e-mail it to rather-
str@grinnell.edu.
After all, com-
plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do-
ing it alone.

I’ll miss a whole bunch of things about this
school once I’m gone, but I don't plan on,missing
all the conversations I've heard lately that revolve
around putting people down. So many Grinnell
interactions perennially return to making hurtful
comments about others for fun, and that makes
me terribly sad, Don't we have more interesting
things to talk about? I thought that mostofus
would drop the use ofpetty tear-downs soon af—
ter high scliool,just like we stopped using "gay"
as a synonym for “heinous." Surely most of us
know what it feels like to ﬁnd out that pcoplc
talk- about you behind your back: it feels really
shitty. Perhaps‘ifwc tried to minimize the makr
hag-other-people—feel—shitty components of our
own lives, we'd all be a little happier.

Fuck the Grinnell website search feature. it
alnays rrnds random outdated webpages instead
of pertinent information. I am so angry right
now I cannot even think about an example of
this. The only object or my mind is an all-en»
compassing hatred whose physical manifestation
is making my body sore with tension.

Unacceptable bathroom etiquette:

a) pissing with the stall open

b) talking on the phone while in a stall

c) doing both at once

:1) doing both a and bin the middle ofa Sunday
afternoon.

Stay classy Gtinnell.
