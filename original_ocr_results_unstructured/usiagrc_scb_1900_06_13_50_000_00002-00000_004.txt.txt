all well written and well deliverr
ed. and reﬂected great credit up
on the speakers. The main critie
cism that could be offered is. that
the time limit was not strictly ob
served, some of the productions
being much too long.

After a pleasing musical selec-
tion by Prof. Cole, Rev. Mr. Wil-
son gave the invocation.

owing to some irregularity in
the preliminary contest, there
were four speakers representing
the Freshmen class. William P.
Bair oi Des Moines spoke on the
subject, “Bismark;" Louis B. Van
Hoesen of Des Moines on ”Na-
poleon Bonaparte” William F.
Hunting oi Sloan on “Mormon-
ism;" and J. W. Dickinson of
Tarchwood on the subject, “An
Unjust War.” In the interval bee
tween the two class programs,

Dreams" from Tosti in a very
pleasing manner,

vius of Hampton spoke on the
subject, "The Boer," Jay Clarke.
Jr, of-Newton on “The Confeder-
acy and its Leaders;" and D.
Ernest Crabb of West Plains, Mo.,

femur: “Joyous Wanderer,"

These Hyde Prize Contests are
the training schools tor the tuture
college orators, and as such are a
valuable adjunct to a thorough
oratorical training, The interest
and spirit shown by the orators
and the encouragement they re
ccive is to be most heartily com~
mended.

Hofmann's Melusina.

Count Raymond, while hunting,
woos. wins and weds Melusina, the
leader of a band of water nymphs,
under a vow that she may “steal
away" one day in seven, whither
he is not to know nor seek to
know, Drought and tamine
threaten his land, and the people
ascribe it to his union with Melur
sina. Urged to ﬁnd her during
one other absences. he ‘secks at
the spring and ﬁnds her, amidst
her companions, in the dishabile
of a mermaid, Such an intrusion,
‘sul‘ﬂciently offensive without the

 

aggravation of a broken oath, \vas
nnpardonable and demanded exr
piation. Melusina was banished
to ocean depths, the Count to re-
main on land; but in a ﬁnal em-
brace, he dies. The Naiadsabanr
don the fountain. but from the
deep waters, ﬁowing by Ray
mond's tomb, the sad voice of
Melusina at times implores him
not to forget her.

Two eminent composers have
found in the story of Melusina the
source or genuine inspiration—
Mendelssohn, for a delightful
overture. and Heinrich Hotmann
for the more deﬁnite action of a
melodious cantata. The treat»
ment at the story by Mr. Hot.
mann is highly poetic. Sweet
melodies abound and even the
choruses are melodious as well as
rhythmical. The dramatic situa~
tions, tho’not intense. call for con-
siderable strength, and the music
responds with sufﬁcient force, but
the prevailing character is beauty.
There is hardly a harsh passage
in the work.

As presented tor the Com-
mencement concert Monday
night, Prof. Cole has maintained
the standard of excellence that
marks this agreeable annual event.
In the title role. Miss Helen
Buckley or Chicago, made a very
pleasant impression. She has a
purcsopranc voice of ample range
and ﬁne quality, and a capacity
tor dramatic expression even be
yond the demands of the Melusina
music. The absence of bravura
effects in the score deprived her
of an opportunity to show the
high degree of training she has
had in brilliant execution. as seen
in the song selections given by
her after the close of the cantata.
Mr, Emery, asthe hunting Count,
sang the music with much grace,
and with sufﬁcient force and ex-
pression in the vigorous scenes.
He had several duets with the so
prano. Mrs. Heidel, as Clotilda,
the Count’s mother, sang sweetly
the gentle part assigned her. Mr,
E. B. Brande had the double role
of Sintram,brother ofClotilda and
King of the water spirits, both of
whom are inimical to the union of
the hero and the heroine, Hehad
several sweet melodies suited to
hissympatheticvoice, Thechor-
us work was a distinctive feature
of the performance, Firm tones
and ready responses to the lead—
er's baton showed good training.
Many of the choruses are as me-
lodious and full of color as the

airs, and some are even brilliant
in their effect. requiring quick
and delicate work,

The entire production will be a
pleasant memory of lgoo. At the
close Miss Buckley sang a group
of her own selection, including a
Scotch song and a very pretty
French song and was called upon
for a repetition.

Hill Prize Contest,

A ﬁne exhibition of the quick-
ness ot thought, accuracy ot
reasoning, command ot language
and general broadening and deep-
ening ot the natural capacity.
which a college education gives to
one who deems the return worthy
of the strife, was witnessed in the
Hill Prize contest. held at the Con
gregational churchTuesday morn
ing. The work was entirely ex~
temporaneous, only three hours
preparation being allowed, and it
is much to the credit of the con-
testing parties that they are able
to stand before an audience and
talk, rationally and intelligently,
without pause or confusion (or the
alloted time of twelve minutes,
Furthermore. it is particularly
ﬁtting that Seniors should partici-
pate in this contest. Extempoe
raneous speech-makingmore than
anything else, perhaps, affords
abundant opportunity to employ
a trained mind and a trained
tongue; and that Seniors acquit
themselves with credit in such a
contest is a further proot ot the
beneﬁts derived from a college ed»
ucation. Those who did not seA
cure a prize in this contest are not
disgraced by any means. The
work ot every member of the pro-
gram was ot a high order and an
honor to the college.
