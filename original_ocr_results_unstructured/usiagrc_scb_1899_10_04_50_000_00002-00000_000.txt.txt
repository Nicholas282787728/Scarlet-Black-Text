THE FALL ﬁeld meet will be
held at Ward Field nextSaturday
afternoon. The number of men
out each night, and the work be-
ing done by them, gives promise
of a very interesting meet. Since
the ﬁrst day of school. new men
have been out, working under the
direction of Mr. Watson and Cap:
tain Snider, and with the generous
handicaps which will be given
them, wtll furnish the old men
with weithy competition, This
meet in the fall was omitted last
year owing to the lack of interest
displayed, This year, tlle track
men have been unusually fortuc
nateinltaving Mr. Watson here,
and have shown their appreciation
by hard work. They have done
their part toward making a good
fall meet; it remains for the stu-
dents to do theirs. The ﬁrst event
will be called promptly at two
o’clock, and there will be no der
lays between events. The track
will be clear, no one but contest-
ants allowed on it. We lost the
state meet last year, for the ﬁrst
time in seven ycais. These men
who will contest Salurday. are
men who will try to win us the Cup
next year. The menneed encour-
agement and the Athletic Union
needs money. Every student
should plan to attend this meet
and thus make it the success it
can be made.

The debate came next, the
question being: “Resolved that
the United‘ States government
should provide for the mainten»
ance of authors and artists."
Jones supported the afﬁrmative
and McMartin the negative. Mr.
Jones put much spirit into his ar-
gument, taking the ground that
such action of the government
would encourage literature, make
the writer more free and give him
more time tor thought, thereby
raising the quality of his work.
Mr. McMartin held the opposite,
that such action would lowerthe
quality of the work, lower the
morals of the writers and thereby
lower the morals of the people.
Mr, Crosby gave the debate to
the negative on the ground that
the afﬁrmative had evaded the
question by interpreting the ques-
tion to mean partial maintenance.

The society then listened to the
critic’s report by Meade,

At the‘ business meeting Mr.
Crab and Mr. McKeg were voted
ill as members of the society.
