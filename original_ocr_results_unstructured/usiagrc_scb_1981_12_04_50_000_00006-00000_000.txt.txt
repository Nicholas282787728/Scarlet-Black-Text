In her Oscarwinriing periormance,
Joanne Woodward does an admirable job
oi tackling a very ditiicult role — that oi
three personalities in one body. The first,
Eve White, maintains a mousy demeanor,
totally unaware of her ‘other selves,‘ Eve
Black, on the other hand, ls a trampish
woman who enjoys nothing more than go
ing on a big drunk, only to leave the other
Eve with die hangover. Eventually Jane, a
third personality balancing the two exr
tremes, emerges through therapy, Woods

Ward's sklll keeps this movie from becom-
ing a sort of “musical personalities.‘ An in-
teresting movie which looks at multiple
personalities for the first time 7

memoir. This imbues it with an honest,
energetic and straight iorward style.
Kurys is not afraid to Show the pain and
poignancy natural to adolescence but does
not fall into the awkward, unrealistic
cliches typical of such movies. The film re-

mains vlvid and original. The Critic Ana '

drew Sarris praised it ior its “marvelously

strength that allows it to remain, above

Directed by the ever-changing and
always interesting Roman Polanski,
Chinatown is certainly one oi" the most im-
portant films or the terms and one of the
most entertaining. It is a recreation or the
genre or tilm-noir, with Jack Nicholson as
the cool, and smart but vulnerable private
eye, Nicholson, working in 1937 in Southern
California, takes on what he thinks will be
an ordinary matrimonial snoop job. But
burrowing deeper into the case, he finds
himsell investigating a murder and
beseiged in a public scandal iollowing the
murder. The movie succeeds on many
levels, both in the (ascinating construction
of lts Individual scenes and the dark,
menacing aura it creates in its Vision of
this seedy underworld. The credit [or the
creation must go to the meticulous and in-
spired Polanski. Not a film to miss, ~John
