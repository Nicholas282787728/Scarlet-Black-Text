Depleted Drama Dept. Gets Premier
Donation - Colbert’s Sizing Brush

Who even hinted that the journalet':
ism and drama departments
aren’t the best of friends? All
rumors of enmity were disproved
when Herschel M. Colbert, head
of the journalism department,
presented to Mrs Sara Sherman
Pryor, drama head, a sizing
brush.

“We accept our first donation
gratefully,” said Mrs Pryor. She
added, “It is extremely consider—
ate of the journalism department
to remember our loss in the fire
and to make the first move to-
ward rebuilding the drama wor -
shop.”

or course, the workshop classes
have no place to wor Anothing
to paint and no paint—but they
do have the sizing brush, Alfred
Boylen, workshop instructor, sug-
gests that until a new shop is
found, he will be glad to use the
brush for his haii (Members of
the department agreed that using
it as a hairbrush was an excel-
lent idea. They even went so far
as to consider giving Al acomb.)

.As for material to paint, Plat
Number 267 is the only one saved
of the drama department's equip-
ment, and it doesn’t need paintv
ing. Because it was too large to
go through the workshop door, it
was left on stage and is now on
display in the flies as the sole
surviving flat.

”Oh, well." say members of
the department, ”We'll give plays
like ”Our Town” that don't rec
quire scenery."

Plan-u

the trustees several years ago,
and which has never been fulfill-
ed. To fulfill that obligation, the
Student Council proposes the fol-
lowing action:

I. That the Women’s Social
Budget and the Council of House
Presidents take over the financing
of the White House. That this
year's Social Budget and Council
of House Presidents recommend to
their respective incoming bodies
that each deduct $250.00 from
their social funds to be given to
the White House. The appoint-
ment of and the administration
through the White House commit-
tee of the White House shall con-
tinue in the hands of the Student
Council.

H. A. That the present sup-
port of the Scarlet and Black by
the general fund of the college he
abolished by reducing the subsidy
from the general fund by 25c per
student each year until the pre-
sent support of 75c per student
be abolished.

Under the present financial plan
the Scarlet and Black requires
$550.00 as a subscription from the
students to operate, and this sum
is derived by taking 75c per stud-
ent from the general fund of the
college. This could he better util-
ized for salaries and maintenance.

B. That the present Student
Council recommend to
student Councils that the Scarlet

and Black he supported by the '

semester tee in the following mane
her:

1. That 2 percent of the 1940-
41 semester fee, a percent of the
194142 semester fee, and 5.5 per-
cent of the 194243 semester fee
be apportioned to the Scarlet and
Black. 5.5 percent of the serous:
ter fcc represents approximately
$550.00. This shall he considered
as the permanent plan of financ—
ing the Scarlet and Black.

2. That any profit over the
maximum set by the Publications

Board be placed in the reserve '

fund of the Publications Board.
