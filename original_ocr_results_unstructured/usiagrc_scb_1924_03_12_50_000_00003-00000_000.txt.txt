Place In Cup Finals

Good teamswork sent the fresh lins—
keteers through to it place in the fills
ills for the Sonlel's Cup, when they dee
{sated the senior teztm by a score of
24 to 9 at the Rind gymnasium Mons
day afternoon.

Although Crippled by the loss of a

center, a tor-ward, and a guard iroinl

their .iirst team, the seniors showed
unexpected fight. Cutler at guard
and Mines at forward did good work
but were handicapped by inch ct team»
work and unsteady support in the cons
tei' field.

First blood wont to the seniors [ml
a basket by Mines soon alter the fi t
tip—off, but the freshmen round their
ieet in the second quarter, when Har-
ris and Lander succeeded in rnalang
five baskets.

Senior detence stiirened in the third
quarter, when they held the freshmen
scoreless and made one basket, Their
deience soon weakened in the ionrth
quarter, and’the game ended with a
score or 24-9 in iavor or the freshmen.

This victory enters the rreshman
team in the iinnls tor the Somei"s cup,
which will probably be played Setun
day aiternocn at the Rand Gym, At
this time, they will meet the strong
sophomore team, which has been unde—
ieated ior two years.
