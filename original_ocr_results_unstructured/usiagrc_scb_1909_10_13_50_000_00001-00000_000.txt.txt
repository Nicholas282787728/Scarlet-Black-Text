school game, which resulted in a store

was won by a store or 1H7.

Both games were close enr

was scrappier and harder

The College garrie was called about
4:45 and atter about ten minutes or
play, Marshall made a good drop klcl:
from the twenty yard line. Des Moines
continued to otter stubborn resistance
until nearly the end oi the irrst halt,
when Ziegler ran torty yards tor a
touchdown. The tor-ward pass was
used twice near the beginning or the
game, but troin that time on there was
nothing but straight rootriall,

The second halr was also devoid oi
anything sensational until Marshall
caught the hall on a punt and raced

the store to its iinal total, 1-170, and
the remainder oi the game was rather-
slow and uninteresting.

The contest developed a number or
weaknesses, but the poor condition oi
the tield and the iact that Turner- was
out or the game with a wronched
shoulder parti iii explains the limit oi
strength. Wells did some good triti-
ling, but ilrat oi the team as a whole
was weal: Marshall and ziogler both
showed up well .is grouni gainers and
Marshall's printing was also good.

Four substitutions were made in the
second halt inst to give the men a
try-out, but no one was innired during
the game, Tire absence ot Turner was
felt keenly and irnless his shoulder
gets better very rapidly the ames
game will have to be played without
him.
