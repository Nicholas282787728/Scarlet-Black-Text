SELF PROTECTION

W'c wonder if there isn’t something of the idea
of self protection ill the wave of protest against
“higher education for all,” displayed ill collcgc
newspaper editorials throughout the country, and
ill interviews with college administrative officers
ill the metropolitan press. Their argument. good ill
part, is tllat education should be a select 0 process.
that there are many persons for whom a college or
university training is not to he recommended, that
the student who is hllrdened witll financial worries
docs not ohtain enough from his college work trr
make it worthwhile, and that all excess of second
rate student. ill colleges has loll't‘l'ed the standard
of education and chcaponed the value of a decree.

\Vhilc some of this is true, the editorials and
interl icws do not mention their major gl'levallt't‘i
that competition between graduates and lHSilllk
tiolls themselves is keeller because of tho ii on ~
ing number of college men and women. It makes
for ll survival of the fittest which, stl'iiuucly
enough. tliosc uho arc in uillg for the ex usitlu ot'
the unfit from colleges, do ilot like to admit.

the institution and after graduation tends to cull
out the misfits, llccallsc of this very tcndcllc ' to

cial worrics detract from college work, lult llt‘l'C‘
the results depend upon the individual rather than

Rather than saying that an excess ol‘, olid

Of education, we would repeat that such a ("0“le
tioll has increased competition and has ll|7|(l(’ the
real student work that lunch hal'dci'. It has also
increased the enrollment of graduate Schools. To
l y that professional schools are turning out grad
uatcs of a lower class than those of previous years
is to make a misstatement, for rcqliirelllcnts are llc-
eoiiiing more and more stl‘ic because ol' the in.
creasing clamor for admission.

If tllc increase in number, of students has
chcapcnetl the value of a degree, it has also taken
away from the less competent student the pr cgc
of riding along 011 his degree with nothing also to
back him up. Education, today, is indeed a selec-
tive pl‘060557ﬂl‘id it is selective because of the very
situation which the dissenters wish to oomllat.
“Survival of the fittest” is a oold-hloodcd phrasci
one which the rcactioual‘ics do not like.

NAVY BRISTLES
(The hitercolleginn)

It is encouraging to point to one piece of evidence
for a growth in international mul‘alityAthe recent de-
velopmohts in American foreign policy in relation to
Latin America, One must given Hoover and Stimson
much Of the credit for these developments. The high
point. so far is the unequivocal declaration of President
Roosevelt that henceforth we will bar armed interven-
tion in the countries of Latin America.

If measures miist be taken to restore order in any
country. our policy will be to cooperate with all the
countries in this hemisphere in some kind of joint ac-
tion. This is an advance over the days of Theodore Roos—
evelt and his irresponsible big Stick. It is even an ad-
Vance over the days of young Franklin Roosevelt, as-
Sistant secretary of the navy. Also, what a relief from
the presidential smugness to which we have been ac-
customed, to have the president admit that he undere
stands why it has been difficult for ci zens of other
republics to believe in the altruism of American policy.
Indeed, in spite of his preoccupation with domestic af-
fairs, the president has been raising his foreign policy
to a higher level. l-lis understanding praise of the League
of Nations is in sharp contrast with his very unfair
statement about the league before his nomination.

The increased influence of secretary Hull suggests
that there will not be a return of the truculeot attitude
which the administration assumed at the time of the
London conference. Doubtless, the president still loves
ships (though his wife warns of the danger of military
toys) and doubtless there are dangers in his recovery
program whether it takes the form of selﬁsut‘ﬁcient
nationalism or imperialism.

One never knows whether to think of the situation
as one Of hopeful plasticity or one o[ dangerous instae
bility. But I don’t think that we should be too much
alarmed by the warnings of :i arxist critics like John
Strachcy who sre us headed straight for imperialist war.
In detecting tendencies in a Situation they are match-
lcss. bill they make the mistake of assuming- that eye
ery Lendenfy will be carried to its logical conclusion
without making allowance for the operation of muddling
common sense or idealism which may arrest these ten-
ueiicies before they become fatal. Fortunately all the
ecoiiis which are scattered about will not become oaks

COLLEGE PRESS FREEDOJlI
(Daily Cnrdnml)

For sheer poverty of thought and complete lack of
intellectual courage no recent occurrence on an Ameri dn
campus is more strikingly representative than the i-
fusal of the American Student federation to approve a
resolution condemning censorship of the college press.

To the resolution offered by a delegate from Colum-
bia university the reactionary representatives of 175
colleges and universities turned a cold shoulder and in-
.iiflereutly voted to table it. The shoddy thinking of the
convention was accurately expressed in one delegate
dismissal of the resolution with the assertion that he for
one “did not want his college's dirty linen hanging on
the line for public gaze."

In coldly turning their smug baelrs on the proposal
for a free and uncensored college press the National_
Student federation is definitely committed to the con»
tiriiiance of worthless campus house organs which pei»
sistciiiiy close their eyes to the real issues of the pre
ent day American university, and. instead, confine the
Pollyanna efforts to continuous glorification of the pier
ayune affairs of the campus, That such a condition of
journalistic poverty exists among American universities
and colleges is amply demonstrutccl by careful reading
of the scores of dailies and weeklies which clutter up
our desk every day.

It Seems almost incredible that the lnoss»covel‘ed
minds of the delegates who voted for a “kept" press
were not in some small measure, at least. exhilarated
by the wholesome atmosphere of the new liberal spirit
in the nation’s capital. That they have refused to accept
the challenge for a free press and free exchange of con»
flicting ideas is striking evidence that a great mass of
American students trod far behind their elders in the
march toward social and intellectual progress.

WAR WITHOUT TRIMMJNGS
(Daily Trojan)

War, stripped of its flag-waving, its idiotic heroics,
and its hysteria of patriotism; war as it actually is, is
being shown to the public now by a series of pictures
running in the newspapers.

These pictur -‘ aren't nice to look at, they are al-
most repulsive, with their flat, hard presentation of
death and destruction. They do not gloss over- the ugly
part of battles. Rather, they show in detail the bru»
tality of the wholesale slaughter that every war en-
tails.

with unrest spreading in various parts of the world,
these pictures present an important warning. They
show what lies beneath the surface excitement of war;
they show what waits for every man of every nation7
every race, creed, color, and religioniwho lends him-
self to the brutal lust for blood that still stirs iii the
hearts of our Semiecivilized nations.

The printed word makes little impression; it is read
and forgotten. The spoken word is heard, and forgot
ten, or incorrectly recalled, But a picture makes an
indelible mark on every mind, from the simplest to the
most highly developed.

Pictures were the earliest form of communication
of ideas, and it is particularly fitting that they should
be used to show the horror of war, for they present

Editor, The Scarlet and Black,

Gl'innell, Iowa

Dear Editor:

For years and years I have hare
bored a desire to write a letter to a
newspaper, It's a complex, I suppose.
Or maybe it's because in the dim
past when I used to struggle on The
Scarlet and Black so many of our
readers felt like writing us: But
those letters were full of catty i-e-
marks This letter contains only come
plimentsl

When the “February 14” issue of
The Scarlet and Black can be sent
second class mail to St. Louis. be
forwarded on third class mail to
New Yorkiand be read in New York
City on the evening of February 13—
THAT'S NEWS!!

The best a metropolitan daily can
hope to do is get its first edition on
the street by eight~thirty or nine the
night before date of issue.

And so, as one would-he journalist
to another, I congratulate you.

It’s a shame the Grionell basket»
ball team were not looking ahead as
you were when you got oiit your
“February 14" issue a week early.
Had they been, they could have ar-
rived six days early instead of one
day late at St. Louis to play Wash-
ingtohl

What intrigues me most. is to pier
tuie how your readers must have
scrambled downtown to buy Valen-
tines when they picked up their re-
liable S. & B.—and discovered that
they must have pulled a Rip Van
Winkle from February 6 to February
14.

Keep up the good work. You might
get oiit ahead of Ballyhoo

Sincerely yours,

A belief in a heavenly Father who
is eternally on the side of righteous-

in their ideals, and to persevere
fulfilling those Ideals, If we have no

were theistic, and bad faith that the
universe was in moral accord with
our ideals. life had no purpose and
value.

These in essence were the words of
the Gates lecturer which I wish to
criticize. Personally. I do not believe
that one miist be a theist to have
faith in one’s ideals, and to strive
toward making the world better,
Atheists and skeptics can also be eth-
ical and work for the kingdom of
God On earth. Because a mail doesl
not believe in a personal transcen-
dent God. he is not therefore incapac-
itated for enduring idealism, sclfe
sacrifice, and social endeavor.

By all means let those have a per—
sonal God who need a moral crutch
upon which to lean They want a"
cosmic sanction of their desires.
They find consolation in meditating
upon and praying to an anthropomor-
phic deity of their own making. God
then becomes a spiritual physician
whose healing touch is solicited in
times of distress. But a man may he
a disciple of Jesus, deeply religious,
ethical. and strive for social bettei-
ment without believing in any kind
of personal, transcendent God,
