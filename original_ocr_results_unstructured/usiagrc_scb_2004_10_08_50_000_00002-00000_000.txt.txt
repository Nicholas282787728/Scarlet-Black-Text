KDIC to air after fall

break

Though Djs (Or the semester had
bccn choscu, KDIC’S abi ry to broad
cast this semester was up in the air as
the station waited for paperwork tO go
through the Federal conimunicarions
Commission (FCC). After paper
work was cleared, KDIC scheduled
DJ training and printed their schedr
ulc, only to have it cancelled because
equipment was not hooked up yet.

KDIC is now scheduled to go
On the air atrer fall break. “It's vcry
frustrating (0 deal with because time
tables keep changing and people’s
expectations keep getting let down,"
wrote KDIC station manager Graeme
Miller via email. “But this time it is
for sure."

Last Sunday the station engineer
was scheduled ro conic to campus to
hook up station equipment, cheek
power levels and install the repaired
ampliﬁer. According to Michael Sims,
associate dean for student life. the ens
gincer made it into town, but while
working locally at KGRN he ran into
far more problems then expected and
was unable to make it to the KDIC
station.

Sims also said that the engineer
feels bad about the situation and has
guaranteed that he will be here this
Sunday tO set up KDIC.

According to Miller, D] training
will be held after (all break.
