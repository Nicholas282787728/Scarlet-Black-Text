THL‘ GRANT OF Poll'Elts.

On Wednesday evening the women
will consider some additions to the
League constitution. since these ad-
ditions are of great importanee to the
strident hody as a whole, it seems right
that every one should thoroly undei»
stand the meaning oi this inorenieiit,
For two months and more a Constitit
tional Committee has heen tiratting
these new articles, roi- presentation to
the League at. its May meeting. The
articles are now in shape, and will
he voted on next weelt. Belore this
meeting is held, the committee is using
every possible means to have every wo-
man in college know the meaning or
the new articles so that at the meet-
ing eve - woman will have studied out
the points she does and does not under-
stand and will know deﬁnitely what
she wants to vote for or against. Thus
the women will have had time to thor-
ol consider what additions they think
Will better the college lire,

The exact nature of these constitu-
tional additions can best he explained
hy citing the need lor them. Any one
who has been in touch with the stir
dent body this year has heard two deﬁ-
nite criticisms or the league. The ﬁrst
one: That the League is not entirely
a' sellgoyerning bad) This er' icism
has heen iust. But in i-iew or the fact
that this is the ﬁrst year or the
League’s e. stence, it could not he ex-
heeled that it should immediately have
full power As matters have stood
this year the League has heen only
Ollerllll'rtl Srll‘-g:\'el‘ning. In the other
t\\ortllil' s it supported standards O\’l‘.l‘
which it had no r itiol. The one
third which it did control \ to
l-ouse regulations The other twor
thirds were the two traditions, siiuda~
and dancing Now the ci-ititism was
that the women could support these
two traditions it they wanted to, it
they didn‘t want to, they had to any»
tray, lor in their constitution they had
710 Construct e or progressive power.
Ti. does :eEm I ght that what the wo-
men support th should also hare a
litrt shale or control over. at loastsouie
means oi ec-optroting with the Faculty
and the whole student liody in social
matters.

in order that this llnst criticism
should he remedied, tho Constitutionnl
Committee ash-ed the iaculty tor a
deﬁnite Grant or Powers. This w s to
state exactly how much pou er was en-
trusted to the women. The women
themselves drnlted this Grant or Pow-
ers, so they had opportunity to ash
{or all the power they thot necessary
in order that the League should indeed
he ecu-governing The Facuty one
operated, suggested helprul improvc-
ments and passed this Grant or Powers
as it is printed helow. The means by
which the women are given a voice in
controlling thc social standards is the
