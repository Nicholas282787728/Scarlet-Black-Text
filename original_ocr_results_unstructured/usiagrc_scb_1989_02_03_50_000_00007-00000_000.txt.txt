Why did the Christmas Eve
riot between Chinese and African
students in Nanjing. China,
occur? And why did it lead to
daily demonstrations by
thousands of Chinese?

As a foreign student in
Nanjing last semester I observed
the growing tensions in the city.
But I was as surprised as anyone
that they should come to such an
ugly and violent head. For my
own understanding and as a
student of Chinese society, I have
tried to sort out the many factors
that could have caused the out-
burst.

The first factor is cultural
differences, which cause much
tension between the Africans and
the Chinese. The male African
students place a more overt
emphasis on sex than the
Chinese that I met did. The
majority of Africans studying in
Nanjing were men. They
generally spend four to six years
in China without returning
home. As a result, most of the
African students I met were very
aggressive sexually.

The dance parties held at He
Hill University were dubbed tlle
“meat market“ by my fellow
American students, Most of the
African mcn viewed the parties as
an opportunity to pick up

women. A smile at a dance could
lead to an invitation to the
bedroom. Sometimes it didn‘t
even take a smile.

We Americans were annoyed
by this behavior, but many
Chinese women who encountered
this attitude were frightened.
China is just developing a dating
culture and for years male-female
socializing was frowned upon.
Therefore the culture clash is
tremendous, since the Chinese
view these more open mores with
a mixture of disdain and fear,

The second factor is that
foreign students on Chinese
campuses have many privileges:

heat a few hours a_ day, showers
in our dormitories, our own

cafeteria, and no more than two
roommates (as opposed to the six
to eight people in Chinese dorm
rooms). We also may go to the
main foreign hotel and eat in its
restaurants, whereas the average
Chinese citi7en is forbidden to
enterl We have special money
that enables us to shop in special
”Friendship Stores" and secure
soft seats and sleepers on trains.
Only by brcaking the law and
using the black market to obtain
this money can the Chinese
enjoy these privrtegcs. In fact,
the Chinese are bastcally second-
class citizens in their own
country. The resentment of
many Chinese students is
compounded since many of the
African students receive
scholarships trotn the Chinese
govemment that exceed what is
given to the Chinese. In the
months preceding the riot, we
could feel something of this
growing resentment. Walking

down the crowded streets, we
heard the taunting call, “Lao
Wai," (“Stupid foreigner,”) every
day.

In addition, it does not help
that many Chinese are prejudiced
against dark-skinned people.
Traditionally, dark skin is equated
with peasants who work out in
the sun and is thus looked upon
as a sign of a low cultural level.
The Africans resent the
condescension. Also, most
Chinese are unaccustomed to
seeing black people and stare
when they see the Africans,
which does nothing to make the
Africans feel any better about
being in China.

Another source of contention
was the wall that the
administration of He Hai
University had constructed around
the Africans‘ dormitory. The
administration said it was to
protect the Africans from theft.
Many Africans viewed the wall as
a concrete sign of hostility and an
attempt to keep them apart from
Chinese students. Some of the
Africans took it down The
administration lost face.

It was under this tense atmo-
sphere that the university
ofﬁcials decided they would begin
to check IDs at the Africans’
Christmas Eve party. They had
to know this party was a big deal
to the Africans and that it would
be very symbolic to use it to
enforce a rule that had never be-
fore bcen enforced. It seems now
the university officials wanted to
use the party as a way to regain
face. They did not realize
tempers on both sidesiAfric‘an
and Chineswwere so tense. The
initial scuffle between the
security guard and the Africans
who were upset that their
girlfriends had to Show IDs was
not so fierce, according to my
friends who witnessed it. The
problem came when everyone
else in the vicrnity jumped into
the fray. The Africans

1.,

overreacted to the securtty check.
The Chinese overrcacted to the
Africans. Much fighting and
rock-throwing occurred. In the
end the Chinese destroyed the
Africans‘ dorm even though
tnany of the students in the
dorms had not even gone to the
dance.

The succeeding days of
demonstrations occurred for many
reasons. False nimors spread that
a Chinese security guard had been
killed and the students were afmid
that the Africans, being
privileged foreigners, would not
be punished. In their eyes, ex-
pulsion from the university was
not punishment. (Two years
earlier after a demonstration, a
Chinese worker was sentenced to
five years imprisonment for
breaking a bowl.) Thus, many of
the demonstrators were protesting
what they perceived as the
weakness of the Chinese
government in dealings with
foreigners.

However, many
demonstrators also had a lynching
mentality. These people rushed
the train station where the

Africans had been holed up.
They also shouted death threats
and racial epithets against the
Africans

It is obvious that the
problems of culture clash,
racism, resentment of foreign
privileges, and distrust in the
government all fueled the riot.
And unfortunately, these
problems will persist whether the
Africans return to study in
Nanjing or not.
