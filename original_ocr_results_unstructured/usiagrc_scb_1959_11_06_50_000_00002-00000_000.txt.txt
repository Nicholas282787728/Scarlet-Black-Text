by John Stocking

The inﬂuence of big business
in 'America seems to touch
every life with blessings; yet
these blessings must be paid for,
not only in cash, but in the bee
ceptance of certain standards,
the standards of big business,
The blessings are well worth
Ethe price, I think; and I think
it is a fool who complains about
that price, or about the price
that is to bc paid in cash. It is
a bigger fool who blames indi—
viduals for the settings of the
price.

 

 

V Whiskey Rebellion-1959 Variety ‘

Since the State Liquor Control commission announced
two weeks ago that it intends to open up a liquor store in
Grinnell, many objections have been raised.

quol- has become,
cepted by somei‘
but nonetheless, 1

In our opinion these are not valid, Li
an accepted part of our society. More ac
less by others and not at all by still others,
in viewing society in its entirety, liquor is accepted,

It is possible now to buy liquor. This can be done by
driving 17 miles to Newton, But Why should this be neces-
sally“.7 Let the men of religion and their congregations
abstain. Let the W,C.T.U. persuade people to their point of
Vlew.

But, finally, let the choice be up to the individual, If,
according to his conscience, liquor is a commodity, let the
individual have the right to buy his liquor in Grinnell,

PETITION 0N PREPPING

WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, D0 HEREWITH PROPOSED

Section A — (In regard to the present prepping program)

that the present prepping program does not achieve the ends for
which it is designed;

that it does not develop a constructive hall spirit:
that it does not rationally integrate freshmen int
academic patterns of Grinnell college;

that it does not allow new students to enter 'nto intelligent and
productive relationships with one another and with upperclassmen;

BUT

that it breeds antagonism between freshmen and upperclassmen;
that it encourages degradation and vulgarity which are, at worst,
harmful to personal dignity, and, at best, entirely ineffectual in
achieving the above-stated goals;

. that it is inordinately time-consuming;
that it is detrimental to the educational objectivcs of the college,
and damaging to its reputation;

AND HENCE, WE DO FURTHER PROPOSE

that the present prepping program be replaced in its entirety, and
that its following specific practices be excluded from any future
program:

Swatting, and all other forms of physical hazing.

vulgarity and obscenity in language or action

The forced wearing of costumes

The forced performance of services for upperclassmen

The forced carrying out of physical activities or stunts (hikes,

calisthenics, etc.)
“Hell Night"
Compulsory participation—coercion of any sort

AND DO PROPOSE

Section B — (In regard to a new program)

that the new program be guided by the following Eeneral princi-
p es:
T

o the social and

he new student should be given ample opportunitv to become
acquainted with other members of his hall, his class and
the full range of social and academic activities of the col-
age.

The new Student should be assisted in developing academic
interests and in acquiring adult study habits.

The new student should be aided in becoming a mature and

responsibl

AND FINALLY, WE DO SUGGEST

that these principles might be implemented in the following man-

Recently several members of

the stl‘ing section of the orches'
ti‘a met for dinner in Main hall

To the Editor:

with the two gentlemen who
this year haye been appointed
instructors in the music depart
ment. Since thcse gentlemen
are graduate students at the
state University of Iowa, they
are on Grinnell campus only
one day a week, We felt that a
dinner might provide a pleasant
medium through which we
might become acquainted with
them and they with us.

Our group was beginning to
assemble in the center section
of the large lounge when the
first housemother to arrive for
dinner stalked up and informed

us in exactly the same manner
as one would use to repel an

obnoxious pet that this Was
where the housemothers sat,

unpleasant things about them. 1 That the people invoiced are

The people who talked thus
are fools who have not yet
realized that Grinnell is a big
business, just like any big
business. The trustees whom
we are fortunate to have are
some of the sharpest, best,
big businessmen in the coun-
try. They would never have
raised tuition if it had not
been prudent to do so.

All businessmen hate to raise
the price of the product. How—_
ever, the competition of thel
market demands a better, or at!
least a better—selling, product;‘
and that necessitates of course,
a higher price. Many industrial.
ists will, as in the automobile
industry, cover their products
with all sorts of ornamental
grillwork, spend millions on ad—
vertising, and in this way in-
crease the sales values of the
product. It is unfortunate that
in fact, cases have been known
lwhere so much was neglected in
the basic product to pay for‘
the ornamental that it was
worse, rather than better, than
it theoretically should have
been.

Yet that's good business, dic-
tated by the situation and the
stupidity of the consumers, It
is not simply the will of some
high-ranking individual.

Grinnell college is beingl
materially blessed. it is
through good business that
this is possible. And if it is
good business to expend the
student body without expand-
ing the faculty, then it must
be done. It was good business
to raise tuition, or it would
not have been done; and if
it is good business to give
grants-iu-aid and scholarships
to high-ranking high school
graduates, and mysteriously
take them away when it is too
late to transfer, then it should
be done too.

 

Material blessings do not
drop from heaven, though some
want us to believe they do.
They must he paid for, in cash,
and possibly in principle.

Group Disiribui‘es
Prepping Pie‘ ' '

An unofficial committee, under
the leadership of Ben Barber,
Jerry Voorhis and Bob Pois,
and including Bob Hines, Mike

Jeff Easterson, Jerry
Tecklin, Gary Felton, Jack
Swanson and Larry Hoffman,
has drafted a petition concern-
ing prepping which is now being

It is hoped by the committee
that a majority of students even
if unable to agree with some of
the specific terms of the peti-
tion, will be in sympathy with
its spirit and will Sign it.

The petition will be presented
to the snecial Faculty-C Df HP
Committee on Prepping, which
is now holding meetings on the
present prepping program .

 

officially members of the Grim
nell faculty is not important.
For anyone to show such brazen
discourtesy to those who are.
obviously guests is inexcusable.
It is axiomatic that Grinnell is
not a paragon of etiquette. Yet
it would not seem unreasonable
to expect members of the com.
munity to conform to some basic
standards of human decency.
Or are the Grinnell housemoth-
ers above this?

To the Editor:

Why has talk of prepping
become so dead in the minds
of the very people who wanted
’to change it? Proposed bull
sessions, referendums and a-
mendments hung in the air for
a time, but they disappeared
almost with the change of sea»
son.

Most of us seem quite con-
tent with our complacency.
At least, no one seems to
want to take any positive act-

same dichotmny is reproduc-
ed. It becomes necessary to
act, and there is no action.

In their first days at Grin-
nell, most freshmen seem slight.
ly lost. It doesn‘t take long for
them to be further lost in the
excitement of prepping. _And
when it’s all over, everyone has
had fun. In the midst of Grin-
nell’s contented herd, a few mall»
contents come forth every year
to suggest that prepping, for
men at least, has lost touch
with its basic aims. How dull
of them.

Prepping is designed to inte—
grate the befuddled prep to the
Grinnell social system. There is
doubt about the existence of
such a system, some reformers
proclaiming it an anachronism.
What is this but the failure of
us all to make any sort of ad~
justment forming an integrated
society. Even so, I have found
a reasonable amount of friend-
ship, intellectual sparring, polit-
icizing, and dating to exist here.
But is the prep made aware of
any of this?

If Grinnell society consists
of nllowing the more foolish of
our upperelasmen to maintain
personal integrity by beating
props into lowly submission;
or if it is designed so that all
my have an abundance of
fun; or if it means that every-
one should suffer himself to
laugh while a minority of rum<
miss direct the obsenities held
in nibble, Clark, beles or
Rawson on Hell Night. then
the prep is made fully aware
of Grinnell society.

I’m sure that prepping means
more than catering to recogni-
tion-starved upperclassmen. I‘m

ltial, but I Wonder if fun is a
means to develop and integrate
any sort of potential.

 

(See copy of petition at left).

It's important to have fun, but

[era

one can find it wherever he
looks4—even outside Grinnell. lf
prepping is really going to in-
tegrate the prep, it’s got to
show him that Grinnell is not
only a place of fun but also
a place where serious things
happen.

1 think the prep should be
made aware of what these ser-
ious things are. He is here to
learn from books and the ways
of others. He has to learn how
to study and how to live with
others. He needs a broad base
to deal with liberal arts and
,the art of living an active life.
He needs to lead and to be
led. No one expects him to learn
all this by himself so we, who
expect that he will learn, have
a responsibility to see that he
does. .

And what way is there for
us to do this titan to share
and to do? Sharing is a ncbu-
lous term. Does it mean that
we should shove our lives
down the preps‘ throats? Most
would resent this. Most would
I resent those who are too eager

to help. But a good many
more don’t mind taking part.
They wouldn’t mind Hell

Night games if they could play
too. It‘s time to make the up-
perclassznen take part in the
games.

Preps would be glad to know
that someone could help them
with a problem. It’s time to
have individual upperclassmen
as hall fathers. They wouldn’t
Imind hall activities if something
like a majority took part. It’s
time that we have activities to
‘meet the needs of people who
like not only lM’s but also the
art of discussing, the fine arts,
and hell parties that might
even be fun.

In short, prepping has fallen
on its face. It needs to be cor-
rected and amended. It's high
time that we have those pro.
posed bull sessions, referendums
and amendments.iThe time to

,dissent is passing. It is time to
