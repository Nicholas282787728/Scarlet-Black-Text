AN mu’ORTANT CHANGE.

With the announcement oi a pep
dance Friday night. college authori-
ties are beginning what should prove
to he an admirable policy oi holding
dances earlier than Saturday night.
Doing away with Saturday classes
removes the only reason ior no Fri-
day dances.

The policy will have two important
eiiects. Freshmen who are home-
sick and others who are interested
in visiting over the weekend may
take ample time away irom Grin—
llell, without missing this side or
student life and those in charge oi
lecture courses now have Saturday
available ior engagements
having to meet the

without
criticism that
they are spoiling a dance night.

A DISCUSSION OF STATISTICS

The local sports statistian has
discovered that Grinuell leads the
football series with Ames, taking in-
to account only the last five years.
The fact that Iowa State is a. school
of more than seven thousand, makes
Grinnellians particularly proud oi
their record. on the other hand
Drake, less than half as large as
Ames, has an overwhelming record
of victories over the Pioneers.

All of this shows that records can
not be taken at full face value. The

NOTICE.

I wish to make it clear that l have

The statement which was attribut»

Thursday, Sept. 26, in the article.
"Senior Girls are Skeptical oi Dean's
Explanation,” has no ioundation
whatever.

I have said neither in iact nor by

student or representative oi any puh-
lication. Thank you.

HILE Yale and Princeton were battling to a

tie at Hoboken, New Jersey, in small gioup

of scientists, directed by Thomas A. Edison, was busy
at Menlo Park, only a few miles away. On October
21, their work resulted in the ﬁrst practical

inéandescent lamp.

Few realized what ﬁfty years would mean to both
electric lighting and football. The handﬁll who
watched Yale and Princeton then has grown to tens
of thousands today. And the lamp that glowed for
forty hours in Edison’s little laboratory made
possible to-day’s billions of candle power of elec-
tric light. In honor of the pioneer achievement, and
of lighting progress, the nation this year observes

Light’s Golden Jubilee.

Much ofihls piogiess in lighting has been the achieve-
ment of college-trained men employed by General
