,THE TRACK SEASON.

With the State Meet in Des
Moines ended today, ‘Gi'innell has
ﬁnished another successful track
season. With its passing the Mal-
tese Cross has heEn left again in
an important place in state track
circles

One at those who deserve credit
fur this year’s success is the man
who has been in charge of ath—
letics here. Although it is part of
his business to coach track teams,
he has done much more than his
pus on demands. “Doc" Huff has
put a. spirit and devotion into his
work which seldom goes with a
position like his. Grinncll people
should appreciate what he has done.

But Lou much credit must not
go to one man {or what a. group
has done‘. While a. coach may do
much, his men may do more. This
senson's track team has been de-
voted to the interests of Grinnell
to an extent that has brought Vic-
tury. The men who striyed and
succeeded deserve much considera-
tion at the hands at Grinnelllans.
Those whose names have not ap-
peared in the newspapers as with
ners have also put much spirit and,
life into local athletics and they
should be remembered as well.
Without their interest, too, Gl‘innell
trnck prospects would have lagged.

Yep, the “lazy hug" seems to be
getting everybody.

Gone swimming yet?
