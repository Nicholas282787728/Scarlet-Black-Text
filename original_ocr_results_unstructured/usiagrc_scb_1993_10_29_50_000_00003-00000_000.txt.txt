Sharples & Mabon Movie Reviews: C 001 Runnings

By Riva Sharples &
Bill Mabon

IVA‘S VIEW: The movie
R Cool Running: is refresh-
ingly different from other
films showing in theaters right now.
Based on the true story of the
1988 Jamaican Bobsled team, the
moviestars DougE.Doug,Rawle D.
Lewis, Malik Yoba, and Raymond
Barryasfouryounglamaicansforced
together by misfortune to form the
first Jamiacian Bobsled team. John
Candy portrays their coach. a once
revered but now disgraced Olympic
medal winnerwholeadsadismal life
as a smallrtime bookie in Jamaica.
CoolRunnings is upbeatand in-
spiring. Even in the face of ridicule
and when everyone is laughing at
them, including their fellow Jamai-
cans, tJie Bobsled team succeeds. "the
movie's ending is somewhat of a
surprise as it is not the typical Walt
Disney ending, but nonetheless, it
leaves the viewer with a sweet sense
oftn'umph. Scenesin CooiRunni'ngs
move quickly, aided by lively reggae
music. Both times 1 saw it, the audir

ence in the theaterclapped,chuckled.
and cheered (on one occasion).

JohnCandy’s performanceisthe
most disappointing part of the film.
His character has very few funny
lines; viewers keep expecting more
butncvergctit, Candy‘scharzicieris
stereotypical and underdeveloped.
The real winners in the movie are
Doug,Lewis,Yoba,and Barry,whose
personalities combine successfully to
make an interesting and funny
Bobsled team.

Beyond 115 entertainment value.
the movie Cool Running: is interest
ing for its portrayal of black men. It
is an invigorating change of pace to
see a movie in which black men are
portrayed as heroes and role models
and notas villains or strictly comical
characters. Overall, Cool Runnings
is an enjoyable and fun movie.

Rating: *“* (out offour).

BILL'S VIEW: The Jamaican
Bobslcd Team, which debuted at the
1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary,
Canada, becamean international senA
sation over night, The Jamaicans
came out of nowhere and embodied
Olympic spirit.

Since the Olympics the Jamai-
can bobsledders have been poru-ayed
in beer commercials and now in the
Disney film CooiRiinnirig.r,avirtual
clone oflastyear's The MighiDucks
Both films feature teams composed
of disadvantaged underdogs clad in
secondhandequipmentwiihadownr
androut coach. Awful dialogue like:
"lwantto go theOlympies,baby. I'm
going to win a gold," notwithstand-
ing, Cooikunningr is much easierio
sit through and enjoy for its small
pleasures than The Mighty Ducks.

The character of the coach,
played byioiin Candy, is wholly dis-

appointing. Candy has displayed
comedic talent before, but in this
movie, he is an uninteresting slob
throughout. The bobsleddcrs‘ char-
acters are better and the audience
responded warmly to their antics.

The worst aspect of Coal Run-
ning: is the cinematography. The
footage is surprisingly meager and
the slow motion shots are especially
tedious.

This is a fine ﬁlm if you enjoy
typical Disney "family movies" or if
you’re taking children out. Other
wise, forget it.
