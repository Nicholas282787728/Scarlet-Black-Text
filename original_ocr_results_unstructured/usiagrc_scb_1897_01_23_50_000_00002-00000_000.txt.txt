Sour): or the methods of disci-
pline adopted of late by the tacul-
ty appear somewhat inexplicable
to the average student, and it is
dinicult to see how they can re-
sult otherwise than in direct
justice to others than the one dis-
ciplined. A particular case in
point is that ot a student who was
suspended from participation in
athletics for an offence which cane
not in any way be attributed to,
and has absolutely no connection
with, the athletics of the college.
Such action, resulting as it does.
in seriously handicapping those
who work taithtully to represent
the college on the athletic ﬁeld.
and to seek tor her the prestige
which honorable victory always
brings, appears, from the students’
point of view, arbitrary and unjuse
tiﬁable arrogation, When our
contestants in the bicycle races
were disqualiﬁed last year by the
League of American Wheelmen,
none deplored more deeply than
the faculty the misfortune that the
track team should be so seriously
handicapped on a slighL technlr
calityt But on that occasion it
was not disputed that the rules
had been technically violated and
to that extent such suspension
could be justiﬁed. In the present
case we can see no justiﬁcation
for the action,‘ancl it on the f0l~
mer occasion, the taculty were sinv
cere in their expressions of disapr

in-

proval, consistency demands that ,
they change their present stand. .

Classical Club.

The Classical club held its sec-
ond meeting at Proleisor Maui's
residcnce Thursday night. Pro»
fessor Hcidcl presented to the
members cl~lllethocl of rciltllilg
metrical Latin and Greek, which
greatly simpliﬁes this difﬁcult
part ot classical training. The
method is based on the consisten-
cy with which classic writcrs re~
tain throughout a lyric the same
rhythm, whether it be the rising or
falling. The measure taltcu fol
illustration and practice Thursday
evening was the logaccdlc, which
has falling rhythm. its basc being

measures which may he suhsti
tuted ior it. Selections from Here

the metre worked out from their
prosody.

At the conclusion of Professor
Heidcl's presentation, Professor

clamation, and the club resolved
itself into an informal social girth»
