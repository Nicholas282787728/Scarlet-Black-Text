GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Secretarial Institute Teaches Liberal

Arts 5

The Grinn’ell Secretarial Institute
operates smoothly and unobtrus-
ively from its modern glasssbrick
enclosed offices in the basement
of the y budding. A mere ghost
of what was once one of the
largest divisions in the college.

Wednesday,it now offers typing and short»
ihand on a limited credit basis
[to those students who wish

to
carry these courses in addition
1) their regular liberal arts pro-
grain.

The curricular isolation of the
secretarial department is a result
of the reorganization of the col»
lege on a strict liberal arts bas-
is. This reorganization, effectr
ed by Dr. Samuel N. Stevens
when he became president, al.
lowed for the continuance of the
department. but only as a thing
aside. It was believed that the
skills developed were so valuable
that they would be studied as a

tudents Ways

nonrcredlt proposition, It has
since been found that time and
credit restrictions keep many
students from taking these
courses who would othenvisc do
so, and gradually more credit has
been given. It has recently been-
possible for a student to take
eight hours of shorthand, togeL‘he
er with accounting and English
courses and thus earn a'minor in
"office practice.”

The service bureau. although
not an intrinsic part of the secs
retarial institute, offers experi-
ence to interested students, They
may learn there to cut stencils,
do filing, handle mail, and take
care of other office problems. At
times students may do all the
work of the service bureau, thus
gaining actual practice in office
work.

The war halted plans in pro-

press for a re-expansion of the
institute, but increased enroll-
ment and release of much frozen
equipment are expected to revit—
alize it. When possible, the most
modern equipment in sufficient
quantity will be offered to secre-
tarial students.

Summarizing the work of the
department, Seldon H. Norris,
department head, says. "The inn
stitute seeks to give students el—
ementary skills in typing and
shorthand to the point of com-
mercial value. New equipment
and an expanded program may
enable us to do more At prEss
ent we don't develop any speed
geniuses we'd rather have
our students type and talre short-
hand at a moderate rate of speed
and be able to do additional work
in an office than to have a speed

typist who cannot do anything
else."

League of Women
Vo’rers Discusses
Yal’ra Conference

Ternberg. Robinson Lisl
Ydlla Accomplishmenfs

The Yalta Conference was the
subject discussed Monday eve-
ning before the League of Women
Voters by Jessie Ternberg and
Norma Robinson.

Miss Robinson listed the ac-
complishments of the conference
as working together with other
countries, coming closer to the
plan of Dnmbarton Oaks by
agreeing to meet with the small-
er nations at San Francisco in
the near future, recogruzing
France as a great power and
asking her and China to help
sponsor the forthcoming confer-
ence, and the adoption of a new
policy in regard to the govern-
ment of liberated countries.

Treatment Of Germany

The treatment of Germany was
one of the issues only slightly
settled at Yalta. “Reparations
probably will be demanded, and
since Germany hasn't the gold to
transfer to the victors, and since
we Will probably not desire com-
petition creatcd by accepting
manufactured goods as payment.
this is a difficult problem to
solve."

Miss Robinson further stated
that labor battalions were not a
.suitable solution in most cases
idue to the problems of wages,
treatment, and type of work in-
,volved.

Miss Ternberg said that these
are still “may", not “will" issues,
and that the final solution de-
pends upon how well we imple-
ment the present agreements. As
for the much disputed Curzon
Line which Russia considers her
inecessary boundary, it follows a
{line set by Woodrow Wilson at
like and of World War I and prob
ably is the fairest way to settle
,the problem at present, Great
‘Brltain and Russia both agreed
ito a new policy in the liberated
lcountnes, subjecting them to the
lbl‘oad jurisdiction of the Big
Three until some sort of repre-
sentative elections can decide the
form and leaders of government
that the people desire. Finally,
the results of this conference
should make possible the accept-
ance of the plan set up at the
Bretton Woods monetary confer-
ence.

 

Next Week’s meeting will be
iheld at 7:30 in Haines parlor,

Jamie Kobukaia will speak.
