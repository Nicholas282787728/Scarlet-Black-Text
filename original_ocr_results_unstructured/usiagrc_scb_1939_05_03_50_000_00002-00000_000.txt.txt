GLAMOUR FOR OUR BAND!

This Friday llight the college band will pr
sent a conceit which will be its last public
appearance of the season.

The program will mark the end of a
period of great achievement for the organi-
zation—a period which has seen the band
develop from an ill—assorted miscellany of
struggling players into a well-instrumental-
ized organization of nearly threerscore mem—
bers. It will mark the and of a year which
has seen our band become a stimulating iii-
fluence at our sports events and has seen
it on the job at football and basketball
games at home and in other cities. It will
denote the close of a season which has wit-
nessed a great beginning ill the rejuvena-
tion of the Grinnell college band.

But it will mark only the achievement of
a great beginning! Greater things must be
accomplished, greater strides forward must
be taken if our band is to reach the peak
And most important is uniforms for the
band.

It has been truthfully said that half a
band is glamour. “Clothes make the mall”
and uniforms make the band. A band adds
punch to any event, be it football game or
political rally, and uniforms add to that
punch.

Let’s not stop with the progress we‘ve
made this year. Let’s not stunt the future
effectiveness of our band; let's give it uni—
forms. Let’s have glmnour for cm- band!

PULITZER AWARDS

Giving prizes is a pleasant way of reward
ing merit; it is pleasant for the givers and
for the receivers. The former have the sat—
isfztction of knowing they have recognized
accomplishment in it spectacular fashion;
the latter have the concrete satisfaction of,
the prize itself. The only dissatisfied per-
sons are those who didn’t will and those,
who disagree with the judges. l

With the award of this year's Pulitzer
prizes, announced yesterday from Columbia,
university, probably not everyone will bel
satisfied. The novel award to Marjorie Kill-
nzln Ralvlings for ”The Yearling” makes
increasingly clear what everyone has been
suspecting—that this award invariably goes}
to the most popular work of fiction of the
year, not necessarily to the best. The poetry
prize went to John Gould Fletcher for his
volume of “Selected Poems” in a year
which saw the publication of Muriel Ru—
keyser’s book of verse, ”U. S. One.” But:
probably no one, least of all a Mid-Westel
el'l‘lel‘, will find fault with the award of the
play prize to Robert Sherwood for “Abra-
hzll‘n Lincoln in Illinois.”

hIidrVVOStel'llel‘S, especially Iowans, should
be plensctl too by the Pulitzer committee’s
recognition of Frank Luther Mott, head of
the department of journalism at the state,
university. His three volume history of‘
American magazines, to be finished in two
more volumes, is a monumental work, us>
definitive in its field as Gibboll’s “De-
cliue and Fall" ill its own. When it is fill-
ished the last word will have been said
about the history of the American periodi-
cal. The award to Mr. Mott may well be
the Pulitzer committee’s wisest clloice of the

year.

TELL us ABOUTl—T!

There has been much discussion in the past
about the cut system here at Griniiell. Some
have urged that the students should have
unlimited cuts, and many have advocated
some other less radical change ill the pre-
sent system. Ill view of the fact that there
is more or less dissatisfaction with the sy»
stem as it is, it seems foolish for the powers
that be to make things worse by refusing to
let the dean’s office tell individual students
how many cuts they have against their re
cords.

Lust year, ally Gl‘illllelliail who wondered
just how many cuts he had taken could find
out by calling the dean’s assistant. Now,
however, the only students who can be told
how many cuts they have are the Very ones
to whom it makes little or no difference?
that is, the ones who have unlimited cuts.
If credit is to be taken away froill any stile
dent whose cuts exceed a certain number, it
is ollly fair to tell hiln how many he has
any time he wants to know. Now one can
only guess how lleni‘ he is to losing Ell] hour’s
Cl‘edliﬁullbll the end of the year. There’s
no warning and no fuss. You lose your
hour and that's all there is to it.

As long as we keep the present cut system
we should try to make it work as well as
possible. There is no place for secrecy in it.
The number of cuts a student has is a mate
ter of importance to him—not 21 guessing
game.

Hitler Denied
To Be Schcming

Tyrant Alone
_By w.C.H.—

Once again the democracies' prime
headache, Adolph Hitler, has
thrown the world into an acute

state of the jitters. Once more
the
aspi .
“I alone, thisnmailng man
has brought himself (to the
place where he holds the dos.
tinies of nations in his hand.
By sheer ioi-ee ot personality
this man has raised himself
ham a. pen less Austrian
housepaiuter to muster oi 85
million sermons. And with him
he has brought his people, liite ,
ing them out or their post-war .
humiliation, freeing them from

the shackles of the unjust

treaty of Versailles, and
stilling in them once more the
pride of a great race.

Through it all he has become'
the best—loved and the worst-hated
men since the first Napoleon. He
has earned the hatred of the Jews
and the distrust of the demo-
cl‘ames who can not condone his
policies or his methods. Yet, in
Germany, this same man is al-
most universally loved and re-
spected by a people who have
come into their own under his
guidance.

Ho’s pictured to us as a
halt-mud tyrant, a iomentor oi
wins, it destroyer of freedom
and oi men. We are in the hall-
it at visioning him sitting in
his Bavarian “eagle’s nest" plot-
ting the destruction of nations
and the euslaving of peoples.
To some he is a man of my—
stery, burrowing in a bomb-
proof cellar and surrounded by
an army oi bodyguards.

But Hitler is less than all that;
he’s just a man—a man who has
his ups and downs, a man who
enjoys things other than bombing
planes and battleships, a man
with simple tastes and simple
pleasures.

He enjoys the theme, and
more and more of late he has
patronized the music halls oi
Berlin Only last week. after
prepai- lg a speech ior which
the entire world united. he
dnshed off to a night spot, un-
intended and in civilian clothes.
He takes a personal interest in
arranging entertainments at ‘
the chlulcellory, such as those
which featured the recent ape
[)enl'nnces of the two Ameri-
can dancers.

He knows his entire personal
stuff down to the char-women,
and he is often seen in the corri-
dors of the chancellor-y chatting
with them about their personal
affairs and the health of their
children, He has had special
apartments erected on Hermann
Guel'ing street for certain meme
bers of his body guard, and it is
his habit to send gifts on the
birthdays of the children of these
families. On a. recent pleasure
voyage he walked about the decks,
conversing with his fellow trav-
elers and giving every indication
of enjoying himself. And, like alll
men, he occasionally speaks to‘
his close f ends about death and
its mysteries,

We here in America cannot
always itgi-ee with Hitler's pol-
ioies nor countennnw his her
