The Tales, of
Tris and Ella

As narrated by James Embryo

"Aaaaayaaayeeeeyooooouuuuuuuuieee-
eel "

This sound, coming as it did from one of
the most unexpected of all directions,
alarmed our-two heroes. Tris, always a
quick thinker (and oh! to ponder the
metaphysical realms to which his intellec-
tual capacity must have extended) said
(bleated7), “Was ist das’!"

“Whatever it is," said Ella, reknowned
throughout our (and not only our, implied
reader) galaxy [or an almost uncanny
sense of hearing, “it certainly is loud."

The two (do you think' they could really
be?) sheep let the Nenturnian, now little
more than an aching mass of pain~iilled
rock»pierced alien ﬂesh, sink to the pave-
ment. And what a sight they saw! Where
had once stood the library, a lormerly
complete library (containing, according to
the rather unreliable scholars of the time,
a’ veritable platinum-mine 0i en—
cyclopedias, dictionaries, and atlases)
marred only by a mysterious hole in the
root — a large hole, large enough for two
(who knows?) sheep 7 where once had
stood a library of such reknown, they gaz-
ed upon two figures, one apparently at-
tempting to strangle the other. poised upon
a table of the most strangely sedate Varie-
