Town Men Vetto Proposal
to Buy Meal Tickets

A motion to spend part of each
town man's house fee for a meal
ticket in the dormitory dining
room was voted down at a meet-
ing of the town men held in the
auditorium of Alumni Recitation
hall Monday evening.

The action was taken because

dormitories. The entire house fee
will now go to the balls with
which the town men are affiliated.

Grinnell

, (By Jim Bradley) ,

The Grinnell football team will
leave Friday morning to face an
acid test Saturday afternoon at
East Lansing, Mich, where it
meets Michigan State's powerful
grid aggrcgation.

The pioneers will have a one
l‘game advantage over Coach Bach-
man's team but Michigan State’s
weight and veteran lineup will
more than ofiset Grinnell’s advan-
,tage.

1 Lose Only Four

I The Micingan school lost only
‘t'oui' men, two backs and two line-
,men, from last year's team, while
the Pioneers lost eight regulars.
Grinnell's lineup is lighter this
year, while Michigan State will
equal their last season’s weight.

Coach L. L, watt is devoting
this week's practices to offensive
blocking and timing of plays, A
long, hard scrimmage was held
Tuesday afternoon in which six
new plays, introduced since the
Central game, were ironed out.

Trumbull Injured

Bill Fowler, center, who re
ceived a wrenched knee in the
opening contest, was in uniform
again in Tuesday's practice. Ber-
nie Trumbull, guard, was dis-
charged frcm the hospital today
where he has been confined be—
cause of an infected foot. It is a
question whether or not he will
be able to play in Saturday’s tilt,
His absence would weaken the
forward wall considerably.

Coach Watt has not announced
who will make the trip. but the
starting lineup will be unchanged
from that of the Central game,
which saw the following starting
array: right end, Hayward; right
tackle. Wittrock: right guard,
Trumbull; center, Fowler: left
guard, Safris; left tackle, Graves;
left end, Klepfer; quarterback.
Bauer; right half hack, McLeod;
left half back. Sampson: and full-
back, Bradley.
