was aroused at coluinhin University
when a group oi students staying at
Furnnld Hall were unjustly punished
for their diligence in pursuing studies
during holidays. An apparition ap-
peared in the window of the adjoining
Journalism building.

The ghoul-haunted students in des
peration sent a letter to D. M. Updike,
acting superintendent of the Depart-
ment or buildings and grounds saying:

"We the undersigned, tenants room

For the past two weeks
we have been o‘bliged to hehoid upon

morbid spectacle of a human skeleton
occupying, it seems, a special place of
honor in one or the rooms in the Jam‘-
nalism building. This room is on the
upper floor and faces the outside or
the dormitory."

The letter implored that some action
be taken to do away with the grim

‘ spectacle.
