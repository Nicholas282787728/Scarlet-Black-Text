Grin City plays the blues

by Lori Lohlllann

The Blues Brothels may have
delivered the blues to AM radio,
but a band called “Grin City
Blues” is bringing the blues to
Grinnell.

The 13 member band seems
more of a blues orchestra con
sidering its size. The group which
plays mostly traditional blues is
directed by Robert Egloff, a
visiting assistant in the German
department.

An experienced blues musician,
Egloff was a member of a six—man
blues group in Switzerland, his
homeland, The band, called
“Freeway 75,” toured from 1970-75
and released five singlts and one
album of original blues material. It
was The blues band in SWltv
zerland” according to Eglol‘f.

GRIN CITY BLUES made its
debut in the Pub Thursday
evening. The band was formed in
midJanuary and finally found a
drummer last week. They may
play the Pub again before spring
break.

A concert is also scheduled for
ARH, Friday Apr. 13. why ARE?
Egloff says it’s the “bluesiest place
on campus.” He expressed distaste
for South Lounge and said that both
Roberts Theatre and Darby are too
large for the audience to become
involved.

 

TllE TWELVE student band
members are: Tom Simpson on
lead guitar; Andy Moon, bass:
Pica Brown, organ; Dan Fielding,
drums; James Cary, rhythm
guitar; Eric Edwalds, trumpet;
Ken Krimsteln, {lugelhorn and
trumpet; John Anson, alto
saxophone and clarinet; Chris
Carton, tenor sax; Dave Kapp,
bass and trombone; John Bullitt,
piano; John Cromwell, harmonica
and violin. Egloff, who plays no
instrument, dog the vocals.

EGLOFF CHOSE THE numbers
the band would do and recorded
them on tape for each member.
Though members may change the
beginning or ending of a song or
add a solo, they basically try to
sound like the recordings.

At the Pub they planned to play
as. King, Muddy Waters, some
Elmore James and Otis Rush, as
well as white blue: performers
such as Eric Clapton, John Mayall
and Blues Brothels. Eglolf said
that the Blues Brothels’ non-hits
are good traditional blues. The
band performs “Messing with the
Kids" from the Belushi-Ackroyd

album.
THE TWO NON-blues but bluﬁ»

related numbers are Chuck
Berry’s rock ’n roll hit'”.lohnny B.
Good” and a piece called “Boogie
Woogie Stump”.

PLAYING THE BLUES
members say, is difficult,
especially if you’re used to playing
rock. This problem, and a lack of
time, appear to be some of the
band's difficulties. James Cary, a
guitarist with the group, remarked
that “It's surprising how much
organization it takes to pull
something like this off.”

Organization is especially im-
portant because of the band's size
and the casualness of some
members about practices. Cary
says that Egloff has “a wealth of
information and ideas“ on
organizing the band and on playing
the blues because of his
professional experience.

EGLOFF STRESSED the impor-
tance of audience involvement in
musical performance saying that
“a spark with the audience“ is
essential to blues. He said that
Mose Allison “Committed the
worst crime" by taking the blues
away from the people. Egloff
sensed a division between the
audience and the stage at Allison’s
fall concert here. The George
Thorogood concert was more to his
liking as it was more personal and
allowed the audience to become
involved in the music.

“It's important to feel the blues"
in order to play it says Egloff.
Blues is based on emotions rather
than the intellect. The recurring
blues theme of forgetting a lost
lover, reﬂects the fact that blues is
“true music" dealing with real life
experiences, he says.

Cary added that “this campus
needs earthy music" and needs “to
have a good time".

The United States could not
prevent Soviet involvement in the
SindVietnamese conflict should
the U.S SR. choose to intervene.
but Such a decision would entail
grave consequences [or Soviet-
American relations, says political
science assistant professor Wayne
Moyer

The Soviets have several options
in respect to the conﬂict: they
could do nothing, heavily assist the
Vietnamese war effort with
military supplies, or launch a
direct strike against China, Moyer
said.

“WE'RE MAKING EVERY
effort we can to keep the Soviets
out of the conﬂict, but what can we
really do’! We can‘t threaten to
enter the war,” Moyer said

“The Soviets will become more
involved," he said, “but it’s a
question of how, If the Chinese
threaten either Hanoi or Haiphong,
I think you’re going to see the
Soviet army come across the
border and occupy a Chinese
province.”

“THE SOVIETS HAVE given
their word that they would aid
Vietnam and they have to keep it,”
he added.

Meyer said he believes “any
lumber Soviet military build-up in
Southeast Asia would be the kiss of
death for the SALT agreement
because there is already some
opposition to the agreement in the
U.S. Senate. But if the Russians go

into China. the U.S. will react even
more severely The arms race will

be on again," he said.

FINALLY, MOYER said the
United States is unable to pressure
China into withdrawing, “The only
thing Carter could threaten to do
would be to stop the normalization
process with China, but he‘s too
Committed to it to back down. I
think it would be very costly for
him politically to reverse his
policy,” he said.

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR of
history Andrew Hsieh said he is
confident that the struggle would
not escalate. “I'm optimistic about
the situation because the new
leaders in China are moderates.
They have no intention to drive to
Hanoi.”

But Robert Grey, associate
professor of political science,
questioned the assumption of
moderation.

"IF CHINA'S primary motive is
to lorce Vietnam to pull her troops
out ol Cambodia, they may have to
wage a Significantly longer
campaign,” he said.

Grey stressed the serious imr
plications for the US, in the event
of a Soviet attack against China.

“We would probably put our
military forces on alert. The
situation instantly becomes in
credibly more dangerous,” he
said.

HISTORY INSTRUCTOR Harley
Balzer agreed “the longer the war
continues, the betterthe chance for
Soviet intervention.” But Balzer,
an expert in Soviet affairs, doubts
a SlnoSoviet armed conflict would
include a nuclear exchange.

“It's much more likely that the
Soviets would use conventional
forces against the Chinese. I
Seriously doubt that the Soviets
would employ their nuclear
capabilities because they wouldn’t
need to,” he said,

GREY SAYS THE present
situation is precarious. “Even if
both the USSR. and China were
careful to limit the conflict," he
said, “it would be difficult (or them
to resist the temptation to use
nuclear weapons. t

“The world is in a very
dangerous situation. We are closer
to a nuclear confrontation between
the major powers right now then
we’ve been in a long time," Grey
Said.

elected.”

The Student members of the
committee strongly oppose
holding campus-wide elections for
CSL positions, Senior Dan Ward
said, “An election Wouldn't get
enough student interest, it's hard
enough to get people to vote in
other elections."

JUNIOR MARY J0 La Du now
serving on the committee for her
second year, pointed out that
students do have input through the
Joint Board. She said, “Approval
by Joint Board does add student
opinion somewhat—besides most
students don‘t have the in—
formation available to them (as
the cabinet does) to choose cmnr
mittee members,"

SGA President Greg Youtz
thinks electing students would
politicize the committee.
"Tederman’s complaint is that the
present selection process is too
political; this would make it even
more so because turnout for other
elections is low,” he said. Henak
agreed, adding, “an election would
tend to turn into a beauty contest.”

Henak proposed to abolish the
CSL rather than add so many more
people, pointing out that CSL would
have 17 members, two-thirds the
size of the 2lrmember Joint Board.

Students also reacted with
hostility to not allowing Joint
Board to be part oi me policy
setting process. Henak said,
“Without Joint Board, there
wouldn'tbe two points of view," He
suggested that if the policies
weren’t sent to Joint Board, the
SGA president, the faculty
chairman, and the president of the
college should castthe final vote on
policies.
