THERE APPEARS to be a very
pressing need for a return to the
good old days of society work in
Iowa College, when Saturday
evenings were held sacred, and
nothing was allorvcd to intertere
with the regular society meetings.
Of late there has been a decided
tendency to interrupt these meet-
ings, on account of conﬂicting
concerts, lectures and parties. and
in consequence the literary worlr
of the winter term has been 5e.
riously interfered with. Itislligh
time that the societies should take
a decided stand, and emphasize
the tact tllat Saturday evenings
belong to them, and that their
meetings must not be interrupted
except tor most urgent causes.
Society work cannot amount to
anything unless it is faithfully
and consistently carried an. Dur-
ingthe tall and spring terms the
action ofthe societiesis hampeled
by athletics; it is only in the win-
ter term that really satisfactory
work can be done, and therefore
it is of the greatest importance
that Saturday evenings during the
winter term shall be kept free.
It requires only a few interrup.
tions to seriously cripple the re-
sults of the whole term's work,
as has been abundantly shown
recently; and the societies cannot
be too hasty in declaring their
rights in the matter.

.s—
Joint Meeting.

The joint meeting of the four
college societies was opened by a
debate between the two men's o-
cieties on thequestion, “Resolved.
that party allegiance is preferable
to independent action.” Crabb
and Meade of the Chrcstomathian
society supported the afﬁrmative,
while the negative was upheld by
Campbell and Snyder, represent-
ing the Grinnell Institute. Both
sides showed thorough preparer
tion. and the debate was hotly
contested, hinging chierly upon
the interpretation of the question“
Protessor Hendrixson acting as
judge gave his decision in tavor

 

of the afﬁrmative.
