Professorial iHabitis Draw Fire
When Reporter Questions Students

Keeping Class Overtime
One of Most Hated l

l

Practices

“Am I mad' Am I burned uplu
sputtered the English major, stallc
ing out of class, “That So-aneso
professor kept on talking again for
10 minutes after the bell rang,
and are starving to death for
lunch!”

That event put an idea into oiii
head, and we started cut to discov-
er the students pet peeves against
their professors. it was easy
enough ,to start them talking; the
difficulty was to got them to stop.
“If that man doesn’t stop teetering
on the edge of the platform and
catching himself just before he i
would fall off. I’m going to I
scream." one girl announced.

Don‘t Grade Exams

A junior lectured at length on
the evils of taking tests which are
tossed into the wastebasket. A bet-
ter story was one of the professor
who announced a test for which
the class studied most of the
night.

"Did you study hard 7" he asked
the next day.

“You know
class.

it chorused the

"Then I don't need to give the
test," he answered. And he didn’t!

Talking in vicious circles; laughr
ing at their own unfunny jokes;
lecturhig with closed eyes and
groping hands in a lullabye voice:
giggling at the fact that a stue
den has just flunked an exam“
these are some of the professorial
habits that are fast changing the
student body into an insane asy-
lum, to hear them tell it,

Hate Unannounced Exams

Practically in tears, a senior girl
gave us her pet peeve, “People
that spring unannounced midrsem-
ester tests ought to he shot," sbc
complained. And a passel'by adde
ed, “People that give any kind or
tests ought to be hanged."

Mat Drills
to Start Dec. 3

New Equipment Ordered
for Wrestler's Use

Practice for Grinncll’s wrestling
squad will get underway Tuesday
night, according to Hamld Callar
way ’38, student coach. A number
of men have been working out all
fall. but with the conclusion of the
football season, serious work will
start next week.

New mats have been purchased
and new tights and other equip—
ment has been ordered for those
who compete in varsity competlr
tion. Negotiations for meets are
underway with a number of
schools, but as yet no definite arr
rangemcnts have been made.

‘bicakfastless to a 10 o'clock,

are the ones who have the same
professor two periods in‘ successlolli
and are forced to hear the same
joke repeated twice, especially
when it wasn't funny the fli‘stl
tinic.

Worn-Out Pulls Despised

Pulls on wol‘nrout subjects, coats
and trousers that don‘t match,
twirling of pencils and pacing of
floo s cvcn long silences wear on
eve rought nerves. And what
is more horrible than to come
and
endure the reading of an essay on
roast turkey by a professor who is
comfortably full of bacon and
eggs?

“There's one professor around.
here who tells you what to co,
then bawls you out for doing ll,"
a quadite announced, “and we've
had. enough of it." A sophomore
complained that he didn't dare talk
to his professors outside of class
for fear of being accused of hand-
shaking.

But the prize pet peeve was
that of the senior man who com-
plained of his major professor,
“That guy talks so loud I can't
sleep in class!"

Schlotterbeclz
Leads Pioneers
in Scoring

Lynn Schlotterbeck. fleet soph-
omore halfback, led the Grinnell
scorers, a checkup on the records
of the past football season showed‘
yesterday, By scoring 26 points,
on four touchdowns and two con-
versions, he easily led all Pioneer
ball carriers.

Two of his four touchdowns
were the results of long runs. Thc
longest came against Drake when
Schlotterheck returned a punt 61
yards for the score. He made his
longest rim from scrimmage
against Cornell last Saturday when
lic rac‘cd 54 yards for the marker.
Against Creighton he made a 75-
yard run for a touchdown, only to
have tht score ruled out because
of a penalty.

Bradley Outstanding

The outstanding features of the
season were the steady playing of
Captain Jim Bradley, the passing
of Julius Bauer, and the open field
running of Lynn Schlottcrbeck.
Bradley proved himself a tower of
strength in backing up the line on
defense, one of the most consistent
blockers in the backfield, and dis-
played power as a ball carrier.
Bauer was the chief cog in the
Grinntll passing attack, while
Schlottcrbeck, as already men-
tioned, was the leading ball car-
rier.

Further investigation of the past
season shows that Grinnell, after
winning three of their first four
contests. finished the season by
dropping four and tying one game
