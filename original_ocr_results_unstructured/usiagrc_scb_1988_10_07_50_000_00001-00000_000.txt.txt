Grinnell ranks eighth in
U.S.News annual survey

by Jessica Weisel

In the Oct. 10 edition of
U.S.News & World Report,
Grinnell was ranked as the eighth
best national liberalrarts college.

Grinnell had the lowest tu-
ition of the top 15 colleges on
the list, and was the only Mid-
western college in the top 10.
The only other colleges from the
Midwest included in the ranking
were Oberlin, number it, and
Carleton, number 12.

This was the first year that
the magazine used objective
criteria in its ranking. Data were
collected on admission selectiv-
ity, faculty quality. resources,
student retention, and reputation.
For the reputation category, sure

vcys were given to deans and ad
missions officers as well as to
college presidents

Grinnell was ranked in the
top ﬁve for resources, including
endowment per student and the
library budget per student. It was
ranked number 14 in reputation
among national liberal~ans col-
leges. l

Grinnell College President
George Drake explained that "the
presidents of a lot of colleges
lobbied (U.S.News &. World Re»
port) very hard to change the
system" to include objective cri-
teria. Drake said that he was not
one of them.

Insisting that Grinnell did not

have to conform to other col-
leges' standards in order to rise in
the rankings, Drake said, "We've
made it by being what we are.
For years we've known (that
Grinnell is) a good place... so to
have this validation is great."
Drake believes the report is
important, but does not expect
Grinnell's reputation to change or
to increase. "People pay atten-
tion to itr..(but) we don‘t want to
attract students who only want to
use Grinnell as a stepping»stone
because it has a big name...we
have a special kind of student
here." He further insisted, "The
Grinnell ideal is not the top-ten

ideal, it‘s to be true to ourselves."

Students attend V-P debate

Fifty Grinnell students served
as pages at the viccvprcsidcntial
debate in Omaha, Neb., on
Wednesday, Oct. 5.

Most of the students are
members of the Campus
Democrats and were bused from
Grinnell to Omaha on Tuesday,
Oct. 4, and returned after the de—
bate Wednesday night.

On the day of the debate, each
student escorted a dignitary
around the debate site, making
sure that he or she made it to in»
terviews on time. In addition,
the students assisted the national
press at the Omaha airport, at-
tended a rally and had a chance to
sit in the gallery and listen to the
debate between vice-presidential
hopefuls Democrat Lloyd Bentsen
and Republican Dan Quayle.

Grinnell was the only educa
tional institution to be repre-
sented at the debate in this way.

"We're really excited about
this," said David Myrcn, head of
Grinnell‘s Campus Democrats
and a senior from Clarksville,
Iowa. "It's a great opportunity to
increase political awareness on
campus," he said.

John Stockton, a junior from
Chicago and organizer of the trip,
agreed.

"We're really lucky to have an
opportunity like this," he said.
"The Dukakis campaign could

have gotten help from college
students in Nebraska, but they
chose to call Grinnell."

The invitation came from
Jennifer Bishop, a 1987 graduate
of Grinnell who works for the
Dukakis campaign in Des
Moincs. "She didn't call until a
few days before the event, and we
thought we might have to recruit

 

volunteers over (KDIC)," said
Stockton. But organizers quickly
found 50 students willing to
make the trip to Nebraska.

The students will share their
experienccs in an open forum at
5:00 pm. tonight. The open {0‘
rum will take place in South
Lounge of the Fonrrn.

Committee addresses
college safety concerns

by Beth Wodzinski

The new SGA Safety Com-
mittee formed in the wake of
student concern over last month's
rape met last Thursday. Headed
by Matt Rickett, the committee
discussed lighting concerns,
whistles, an escort service, and
the possibility of supplying dor-
mitory keys for off-campus stu-
dents.

Keys for oifrcztmpus students
have always been available at the
Physical Plant. A $5 deposit is
required.

The outside lights around the
Forum are now In all night.
This helps alleviate some of the
dark spots on central campus.
Tindall denied rumors that lights
have been turned off to conserve
energy, saying that in the past
year and a half, ll lights have
been added. More lights will be
installed between the Forum and
the Science Building this year.

However, Tindall said, "There
will always be dark spots. I don't
know how we can get rid of dark
spots without turning on the
Sun." He added that, while he is
not equating security with ccon-
omy, that new lights cost 5800
apiece, plus labor and mainte-
nance. He supports "lighting up
problcm areas but resists indis-
criminately lighting up every

 

thing."

Already, 1300 whistles have
been ordered. The whistles will
have "9ll" printed on them.
Student Affairs has offered to pay
for half of the cost of the whis-
tles (they cost $0.47 each); SGA
will pay the other half with the
proceeds of the Oct. 14 FOG
Fast. The whistles will be
available to everyone. In the to
lure, they will be included in the
New Student Days‘ packets.

The dctails of the escort scr-
vicc have not been worked out
yet. The committee has not do
cidcd where the service will be
centered, or who will operate it.
Anyone wishing to help out
should contact Steve Lysio, box
9»er

While the Safety Committee
has the full support of the
administration, Rickcu said,
"Safety is a 2-way street. The
students must do their part" He
advised following "common
sense procedures," such as walk-
ing on wcll-lit "primary side»
walks," and not walking alone at
night.

The future plans of the come
mittce involvc programming on
such topics as date rape, seltide-
fense, and action to take if as-
saultcd.
