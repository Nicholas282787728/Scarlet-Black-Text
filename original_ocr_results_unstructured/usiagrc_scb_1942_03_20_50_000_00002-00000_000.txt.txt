0 Women - Bless ’Em.

Everyone agr es there is a tremendous
pscholog'ical difference between the women
of Europe and those of America. It takes
times of great emotional upset such as the
present war to bring out this inherent char-
acter distinction.

For instance the European women have
traditionally allowed themselves to be bull~
dozed into all sorts of ridiculous positions,
such as rocking cradles and administering
the hash. .

Comes an American cl Sis, however,
and what is the reaction of the women
patriots? Woman’s place is in the home?
Not by a long shot! Wherever there’s ac-
tion and men, there you will find the
American woman with her nose stuck

We have women scholars, women Con—
gressmen, business women, and now begor-
rah we’re going to have women soldiers.

Never underestimate the power of a “'0—
man!

0 Contest Time Approaches.

Once more comes the time of year when em-
bryonic poets, playwrights and artists rush
around frantically in search of last minute
inspirations for submission in the annual
Steiner and Whitcomb contests. And it is
altogether fitting and proper that they
should do so, for these contests have be-
come an integral part of the Grinnell tradi-
tion, a distinctive sign of the primary goal
of our wllole liberal arts educational pro-
gram? a

Who is there among us who does not have

cooped up somewhere inside him a “Vision
of Shimmering Lovcliness,” a “Dream of
Things As'They Might Be," or a “Message
for the Salvation of the Generation that
Walks ill Darkness?" A normally intelligent
college student who feels no such vague
yearnings disturbing his inne' tranquility
might just as well W1 to NC for his whole
effort at higher education.

These Vi ions, Dreams, or Messages
will never be effective, however, until
they are expressed. The attempt may be
crude, and hopelessly inadequate, but an
attelnpt is a whole step farther than
most of us get.

it is inevitable that there will be some disc
appointments at the final decisions in the
Steiner and Whitcomb contests, for not ale
ways those who have tried the hardest come
out on top. But aside froln the material
recognition that sets the stamp of approval
on those who have ill some measure achiev-
ed what they attempted to express, there
must surely be a great feeling of exhilara—
tion among all the contestants to realize
that they have ‘at least taken the step, and
may well conclude with the philosophy of
Robert Browning: “A man’s reach should
exceed his grasp, or what‘s a heaven for?"
