AIM lounche‘s

Grinnell’s AIM program for the
improvement or undergraduate edv
ucation has successfully completed
the iirst phase oi its loayear pro-
gram, President Leggett announced
to the alumni during the annual June
reunion, and is now launching the
second phase of its operations.

AIM was created in 1967 as an
effort to raise a total of 25 mill»

ion for the college and to improve
the educational quality of the Sch-

ool. The first phase, which was to
last from 1967 to 1972, was geared,
toward the goal of raising 10 mill-
ion. This, Legget announced, was
accomplished.

The second phase will last until
1977, by which time the program
hopes to raise another to mill-
ion lor the college. For the first
phase, Leggett told the Sea, ”the
rationale was survival." [he col-

Hurling basement began a year ago
when the offices of the Deans of
Students were moved into what used
to be the Reception Center on South
Campus, and the process was com—
pleted with the latest move, at the
end of May.

Students are now being issued room
keys which will also open all out-
side residence hall doors as a part
of a new program developed by
Business Manager Ralph Pomerank
to make late night admittance to
buildings more convenient ior stu—
dents.

In addition to the added Conven-
whole, the new plan will save the
College several thousand dollars per
year and will give some measure of
added security to the residence
halls.

Before the new system was inaug-
rated, students returning to their
halls after IAM had to ring for a
night supervisor to let them in. To
save time, many students simply
propped the doors open, destroying
any security value the locked doors

Second Phase

lege undertook the construction of
several new campus buildings and
considerably expanded t e physical
plant and service iacil es of the
college.

For the second phase, Leggett

said, ”we have to show at least
within the next iive years a major
breakthrough in undergraduate edu-
cation.” There are so many inno-
vative and creative ideas afloat

in the world oi education, he noted,
that it is difficult for colleges to
determine their directions and the
goals of their institutions, Gri »
nell will be attempting to decide
which of the ideas are useful on a
permanent basis and which are only
”flashes in the pan.” "We wont to

be,” he said, "one of the four or
five best undergraduate Schools in

the country."

named ”Nollen House” by Leggett
at the beginning of the summer,
”There is,” he said, "0an one
White House.” John Scholte Nollen
served as President DI the College
irom 1931 until 1940. His widow,
aged 92, was ”one of the great
ladies of Grinnell," Leggett said.
She died only last year

ADVICE FROM THE CHIEF

with the increasing riproff problem at Grinnell, Chief Peters has some
words or advice on protecting your property and that of your triends.
Bicycles are the most irequently stolen item. Peters advises strong
locks and watchiullness to protect them. He asks anyone in the College
Community who has seen someone tampering with a bicycle to get in
touch with the Police department so the problem may be eased.

peters also advises students to register their bikes with the Department.
The cost is 25:; and bikes may be registered by simply bringing the bike
to the police station. Registered bikes have a better chance of being re-
turned to their owners ii lost or stolen.

'Feters also advises against leaving large sums or cash in dorm rooms,
and adds that rooms should be kept locked at all timesto help prevent
theits.

The best deiense against the ripe” problem, he ieeis, is an aroused
College Community whose members look out ior each others property.

more days.
