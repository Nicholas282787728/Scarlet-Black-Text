Hat Tossing Time

Student Council presidential aspirants have now openly
entered the campus political arena. With “jag” candidates
already a certainty, a council convention is assured. How—
ever, it looks as though there might be more “jag" than ser-
ious candidates. This fact is not especially disconcerting,
if “jag” candidates are taken as such.

Student Council has made noticeable advances this year.
The central committee has studied campus wishes, and ap-
portioned the student activity fee in places where they
felt it was both needed and desired most. The Christmas
formal, with the music of Ralph Marterie, was financed
through an outgrowth of student opinion for a big name
band. The council‘s study and legislation of rules for home-
coming decorations is another example of their work. Their
promotion of Migration Day to Cornell was a successful
step in promoting better college spirit, and better relations
with another Midwest conference school. We must not for-
get multi-ﬂavor coke machines, which have promoted good-
will on North campus.

If the council is to continue in a progressing manner,
the new president must have sound observations about its
present functions, and suggestions for the future. One of
the perpetual problems facing the council is its relation to
League Board and C of HP. Another problem is the coun-
cil’s attitude toward student-faculty-administration com-
mittees. These are only two of the questions which will
arise during campaigning. We urge that the non-serious
candidates are kept in proper perspective, and the serious
aspirants and issueshe considered with intelligent care.

Pri’rchar‘d Uses His Background
In 'Dark of Moon' Dance Lead

‘ By Dick Thailiug

Griff Pritchard will appear in the dancing lead of
“Dark of the Moon" when the musical tragedy is presented
in the women’s gym next Friday and Saturday. One of the
reasons he was chosen may be the fact that he is a pro-
fessional dancer.

For years the freshman from Prospect Heights, 111.,
did some dancing around Chicago on programs with such
stars as Ann Sothern, and

Homer and Jethro, He had part
in the evening grandstand show
at the Iowa State Fair in both
1953 and 1954.

Last fall, Griff was late to
school because he was dancing
with the chorus in General

Motors Powcrama show, near
Soldier field on Chicago’s lake
front. The show, which start
ed the last part of August,
ran until Sept. 25.

Powerama was an immense
rainbow-colored exhibit puﬁl'lCr
izing and glamurizinlg the plain-
'Jlane diesel engine. To make the
diesel debut complete, GM built
a grandstand where 7,000 spec-
tators could watch an hour-long
musical entitled “More Power
co You.”

A Chorus of all young dancers
from different parts of the
country set the theme for the
show, which included circus
acts; mamboring bulldozEs, and
tractors that did a “dossido.”
Griff was one of lbs 23 male
dancers.

The group put on four
shows a day, seven days a
week. Griff's biggest part was
when he and a friend from
New York put on a tumbling
act while thirty girl dancers
in Silor outﬁts looked on.

Choreography for the whole
show was done by Richard and
Edith Barstow, who plannned the
dancing in such pictures as

“Greatest Show on Earth" and
“A Star is Barn."

The people who make movies
for Cinerama, Griff said, made
Powerama their third produc-
tlon. He appears in the movie,

which will probably ‘be released
next summer.

Griff thinks the same produc-
ci~s may stage a similar show in
Chicago next summer. “If so",
he said, “I feel sure that i will
get to work with them again.’:

Whether to take up danc-
ing as n career is the big
question in Grifi’s mind right
now. He is also interested in a
science major at Grinnell. He
plans to go inlo dancing in
the summers and if a break
comes along, to follow it up
and maybe skip a year of col-
lege, “If i can’t make a go of
it," he said, “I’ll use my col-
lege education,"

Towheaded Griff, on the light
side (125 lbs.) for his .5- a”
frame, keeps in shape by going
out for the freshman wrestling
team, tumbling on the mats,
and taking a modem dance
course in the evenings. He is
Mrs. Janie Harnack’s assistant
for her social dance class,

it was by no odd coincidence
that Griﬁ was picked to play
the leading role of John the
Witch Boy in next week’s pre-
sentation of ”Dark of the
Moon.” The part called for a
person of Griff's slight build
who was an experienced actor
and dancer.

To the Editor:

About this business of the
Honor Systemgl feel there
should be less talk about IF we
should have an honor system

but more about the consequences -

of cheating, plagiarizing, etc.
This “Honor Syswm" should
place honor on BOTH the sui-
dents and the faculty.

I feel the faculty is just as
much at fault! They give an
assignment or an exam and
know truly that cheating or
plagiarizing takes place, but yet
because lhe cheating-student is
on the basketball, football or
track team, or because the stu-
dent is the instructor's personal
friend, the instructor just kind
of overlooks the dishonest act.
Do two wrongs make a right?

I feel that cheating on an
exam, no matter WHO or
WHEN or WHY, is cheating
on an exam and deserves a
given punishment now come,
in the 1:355 stated in the 5553
a few weeks ago, the punish-
ments for two exam cheateis
were different?--one received
an F in the oouiso foi- plagiar-
izlng while an exam-chum
in the same course received
ONLY an F in the examr IS
this fair?

I feel lhc faculty in these
cases is unfair to the students.
Students who do these wrong
and dishonest acts deserve harsh
punishment, but why isn't this
punishment the same to 211?
Who is to say one cheater is
better than another?

1 am not saying the students
are not at fault and do not act
immature when they cheat or
plagiarize, but i am saying the
faculty should be more fair to
the other students by placing
set rules for set offenses. Just
because I haven’t the ability to
play basketball doesn’t mean I
should get harsher punishment
for the Same crime a basketball
player commits!

i wish the faculty, who are
so busy finding fault with the
students, would look at them-
selves for a while!

Sincerely,

Jean Tiedemann

The election board, composed
of seven persons with the cur-
rent Student Council president
as chairman, conducts the cam-
paigning and election. These
persons determine the rules
governing the whole process, in—
eluding the nominating conven-
tion, brief the candidates and
their campaign managers, and
check on the academic eligibil-
ity of the candidates.

Also, this board establishes
ill doadlines and sets up the
schedule for forums, the con-
vention. and the final election.
Any constitutional questions
or matters of order are decid»
ed on by the board,

Last night the Council fur-
thered the cause of unified stu-
dent government when it voted
into the lay-laws that the pres-
ident of the C of H? and the
League Board shall Serve as ex»
officio members of the election
board. Since they are vice-pres-
idents of the Student Council
and this is the election of the
student body president. it was
felt they, along with the Stu-
dent Council president, should
be on the board. They work
closely with the council, partin
ularly in the central committee,
but it was felt that this would
be a more apparent sign of that
unified effort.
