GUESTS OF HONOR

When parents of graduating seniors attend
college collimencelnent exercises, they are experi-
encing one of thc proudest moments of their live .
Regardless of any prevailing cyllicism concerning
the actual importance of the event, fathers and
mothers are iii their glory when they see their
more or less carcflllly numlred offsprings receive
the emblem of a college degree.

As a lnatter of fact, parents should be guests
of honor at this time. Some of them have driven
or ridden hundreds of miles to be on hand. It is not
the commencement speaker, or the commencement
play, or special social events which have attracted
thcm~it is this single momentous act, the award
of the college diploma.

AS guests of honor. surely parents may expect
that they will be given seats at commencement cv-
crciscs. This, however, is not done. Seats are l -
served for faculty members and college represen-
tatives who have seen the students in classes and
on the campus for four years. They are interest-
ed in and are part of the ceremony, but it is £0017
isll to presume that they are as interested as are
the parents of the seniors.

In the present system, each senior is present-
ed with tickets which admit his parents to the c. -
ereises, but which do not provide for rc'crl‘ed
seats. Last year, according to reports, many pin”
cuts were forced to stand ill the rear of the audi-
torium. A number of them were not only hurt by
a seeming llegligellcei but low actually angry.

Peu‘s in the auditorium of the Congregational
church could not be numbered or marked, But it
seems that a section could he roped off for par-
ellts, and that only those with the proper tickets
could he admitted. It probable that not more
than 200 parents of seniors will be present for com-
lncnccment exercises. The normal seating capaci-
ty of the auditorium, we believe, is about 500 or
900. If a section for the parents were roped off,
it lvould llot deprive many others of seats, and those
dcprivcd would not be so vitally interested.

If such a plan is at all possible, we believe that
it should be carried out tllis spring.

GA
“POUND 0F FLESH”

During the fall semester reading period, the
first of its kind to he tried ill Gl'inncll collcgc, the
plan miscarried 10 some extent through luisundc
standings. Many professors assigned outside rcfclu
ence work and e tra reading to cover the time of
the supposed rc cw pcriod. This defeated the
whole purpose of the reading period ill most cases,
as many students were kept busy on the assigned
work and had no time for ally appreciable amount
of review.

“’9 lvould like to think that this was just all
(we ight or illisnnderstanding on the part of those
instructors who made assignments, and in many
cases we believe it was.

This time the faculty has decided that tlicrc
Shall be no assignments given that will in any way
involve the time of the reading period. Also all
work is expected to be in the instructor’s hands by
the beginning of the period, so that tllc complete
time may be used as it was intended in the first
place.

However, we hear of c.. s in whicll a professor
has doubled up on the assignments for the last week,
and this seems nothing short of “setting a pound
of flesh”. Fortunately such ca ' arc few, but even

they are a breach of ctli Nearly every student
has all extra amount of work during the last week
of clas. s, with last report, makeup work or other
things that have not been completed, and these
last few days should not he burdened by ally double
assignments.

As nicntioncd before, there were not many
cases reported of Such doubling up. and most
members of the faculty are playing fair, but even
one professor out to get a. “pound of flesh" spoils
the record of the college as a whole. If students
and faculty will both cooperate during the coming
days Grinncll may realize a constructivc benefit
from the reading period. The second of the periods
Should receive a fairer trial than did the first.

Other Opinions

THE OUTSIDE WORLD
(S. 0, Daily Trojan)

Do college students care so little about the life be-
yond the campus that they remain almost indifferent to
what is going on in the “big outside world?”

This accusation has been made so often, and in
many cases wiLtl such justice as to give the indifferent
ones something to think about! A rceent examination
in events and names of signifioaoe today, given to stu-
dents wbose intelligence is certainly above the average
and whose knowledge Should by no means lie narrow,
brought this fact out strikingly.

Several of the students examined were in absolute
ignorance of many of the familiar and prominent per-
sonalities in the world today, The name of a city which
has been in the foreground of world affairs meant notlr
ing to them. To some it might have been a salad for all
they knew or cared.

The importance of keeping up on world events and
contemporary thought cannot be overemphasized. If we
are to leave the university truly educated we cannot let
ourselves remain in ignorance of the most significant
trends of the day.

History is in the making, and these evepts, which
so well indicate the trend of the times are both impor-
tant and interesting. it": really no irksome task to fol-
low tbem, or should not be to one eager for a knowledge
of man and his doings.

Vital too is the thought that we who soon will en-
ter the world outside the university must be well posted
on what is happening around us in order that we main-
tain our place in a world which is universal in Scope,
rather than restricted.

OBlT—JOE COLLEGE
(Oregon Emerald)

The campus at large has not yet noticed itibut it
has happened, nevertheless. That lethal agency, De»
pres‘sitm, has accomplished the almost complete extinc-
tion of the picturesque type classified a few years ago
under the Collective heading, Joe College.

Joe was the subject-matter of untold thousands of
younger-geaeration-is»going-toethe»dogs editorials. He
provided inspiration for all those college comic maga-
zines, His escapades were Choice copy for the city cdlr
tor to lay before avid readers, who could righteously ex-
clairn at the frightful laxity of morals on College earri—
pllses. Jokesmiths sweated out reams Of those co-ed-
walking-baok»from-anautoride quips. Joe’s brain con-
tent was low, but his alcoholic content was high.

Classes were annoying breaks in his day’s routine,
for most. of his time was devoted to impressing the fair
inhabitants of Sorority Row, the rest to Seeking dance
chairmanships and playing campus polities. Cartoonists
fitted him witba fur coat and a pennant and made him
the symbol of the college youth of America.

Colleges headed by business men and politicians
instead of educators tolerated him—even solicited bis at-
tendance.

If his indisoretions exceeded all bounds of decency,
lie was expelled. This pleased newspaperrnen. But Joe
himself was not dismayed. There were always more
colleges.

But nowadays, at least, he's strangely missed.
Fathers haven’t the money to send their sons to college
as a stop—gap between high school and hard work. Fra-
ternities have to some extent been purged of the bane-
ful influence—arid for the last two years, the nation
over, fraternity scholarship averages have been higher
than non-fraternity. At the University of Oregon at
tendauee has dropped off considerably, but grade aver-
ages have mounted. Spring term is several weeks old,
yet campus political cliques, instead of being engaged
in feverish activity, are almost dormant. One ticket has
been organized in desultory fashion for student body
offices; there is no Opposition. Nobody cares much.

The majority of students now are primarily inter-
ested in getting an education. They’re willing to live on
a pitifully few dollars a month to get it. 'Flfty per cent
of Oregon’s students are earning half or more of all the
money that college costs them.

Sound taps; Joe College is gone. He is unmourned
by faculty and students alike. Of course, he'll tuin up
again when times improve, But for the present he is
gone, and college endeavor is thereby on a higher plane.

Gﬁ_
AN EDUCATon HAS SAID

“This must be remembered: we can postpone the
building of a road, bridge, or a building, and catch up
on such delayed construction later on. We cannot put
educational opportunity in eolu storage for the duration
of the depression and eaten up on it later on, For the
children who are denied adequate educational opportun-
ity now, it is lost forever. And we shall stand convicted
of having balanced our budgets with the starved lives
of our sons and daughters."—Glenn Frank.

Campus Opinion i

DO YOU APPROVE OF THE
RULING THAT ALL \VOHK
SHOULD BE IN BEFORE THE
READING PERIOD?

Jack .Vlaxliold: I have no Objco
tions to the requirement concerning
reports and vaiious types of papers
but I believe it is going a little fur|
iii requiring all laboratory work to
be finished before the reading peri-
od. Continued laboratory work in
some courses would be equivalent to
extensive l‘eadlng in some other:

.loe Mallllcl'fcld: 1 would agree
With the faculty. However, it would
seem the longer reports and labolar
toi-y experiments are good review,
and to go over them again would be
more impressive to the student.

Clarence Janie . In view of the
fact that the reading period was es-
tablishod for review purposes, I be-
lieve such a ruling is needed. This
makes possible its proper utilization.

Victor Fl No, let the student
follow the “laissez-Iail‘c" policy. He
should know what needs to be done,
whether it be back work or collater-
al reading.

Irwin Oxley: As I understand it,
the reading period is for two pur—
poscsifor remain and to pick up
loose ends. The faculty ruling de-
feats botb these purposes in that
the loose ends must be picked up be-
fore tbe reading period, and that
such papers as could be written in
this timerserving as a review in
themselves—must also be in before
the reading period.

Gaston Santi One purpose of the
reading period is to permit students
to study for exams without the iii-
terference of daily assignments,
therefore 1 think it is a. good plan to
have all papers, reports etc. in by
Friday.

Richard Ullrich: All work should
be complete before the reading pe—
riod, Absolutely no additional as-
Signments should be made; all time
should be used for review, and San
iors with a "c" average or better
should be excused from finals.

Luther Hemphill: I think the re»
quiring of all work to be in before
reading period is unfair to the stu-
dents, Last semester, reports were
turned in during reading period and
students have been expecting the
same ruling this semester, so many
are left now holding the sack. The
purpose of the reading period is said
to be that of doing reading on one's
courses, and certainly this should in<
elude reports which are preparatory
to exams. ‘

uncertainty of the weather.

Tliree Games Played

Langau, Dibble and Gates were vic-

latter part of the week.

Gates won from Dibble 5 to 2 in
one of the fastest games of the year
yesterday. Finl‘s long home run, over
the center-field fence, the first of
the season, was the feature. Botb
Duncan and McKee, rival pitchers,
hurled good ball, but Dihble’s errors
in the field lost the game.

Smith Rally Cut Short

Dibble, however, took Smith 4 to 3
in a thrilling- six-inning battle Thurs-
day. The north-enders gained a one
run lead in the second and scored two
more in the first of the sixth when
Patton, Smith pitcher, walked the
bases full. Brown replaced Patton
and halted the tallying after the two
runs had scored. Smith's last rally
was cut short one run of a lie when
Cook was called out at tbe plate, ale
