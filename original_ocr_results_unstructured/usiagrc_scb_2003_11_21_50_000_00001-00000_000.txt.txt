Faculty and

stymied over

New initiative proposes strategy to
increase diversity of campus faculty, but
there is no consensus to implement it

by Lola Garcia
For nearly a decade, diffelent ofﬁces. committees and councils
on campus have pushed for increasing faeuiry diversiry However. rhc
adiniimtlatiori has liexer decided on a stiutegy to achieve this goala
“There's hardly been a system set in stone," said Mark Schneider,

As a srep toward such a policy, die Evecurive council drafrcd a

one focus of rhe initiaa
rive was re derermrne whar
consrirured “faculty diver-

rhar, in order “to prioritize
commrrmcnrs of rime and
energy, we suggesr inirially

Afrian-Amcritzns, Larinos, Narivc Americans and Asian Americans.

In addirion ro defining the idn of“facuiry diversiry" more spas
ciﬂcally, rhe iniriarive also ourlincs rhe currenr ways rn which the
college arrempo ro increase faculry diversiry and suggcsrs alternative
sruuegies for rhe fururc.

Tire primary recruirmcnr and hiring rcchnioue charhas been used

“based on luck" Monrgomcry said. The srraregy is rhe mosr ﬂexible
bur also rhe leesr predicrablc.

A second cprion, which the deparrmenrs would try under rhe
new srraregy, would be to make room by developing a posiuon wrrh
a speciﬁc person in mind when deparrmsnr chairs “come across" a
porcnrial hire, -

A third srrarcgy is rrying ro attract “senior level hits" by finding
