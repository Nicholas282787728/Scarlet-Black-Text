High school band VIVID
ﬁnds campus options limited

By SARAH STAVETEIG

Arts 8:. Entertainment Editor

LTHOUGH they have per
A formed ﬁve times at Gardner
loungeand twicealtheBaltle
of the Bands, your only chance to see
high school band VIVID this semester
is at the Forum. Last December. the
college prohibited the band from play
ing at alcohol parties,

This has had a tremendous impact
on VIVID 'r fourth year of performing.
'lhe group, which is inﬂuenced by 70‘s
progressive rock, jazapunk and altema—
rive, has remained fairly idle this seme5r
ter. Butband membersarebcstfnendsas
well as talented musicians, and seem to
form a Clossknit band that won’tgiveup
anytime soon. VIVID still plans to on
pand. as members write more songs and
the group seeks opponunity on campus
and in Iowa City
-Why weren’t yml allowed to phy at
Gardner?

Wes Phillips We worked our way to
playing in Gardner lounge 3 lot. Apparr
ently, because we are high school stu~
dents, that wasavxolation of some sortot
alcohol policy. Tom Cmdy found out
about it this year when we were sehcd
ulcd to play. He called us in and we had
ameetlng with him where he told us that
we were not going to be able to play
anywhere alcohol was being consumed.
That’s basically everywhere.

Phil Moon- Ithink its something about
the high schoolers being protected by the
college.

WCSr It all boils down to liability. The
college has a lot bigger problem on its
hands ifzt high school student that has
gotten dmnk at a college party gets in
trouble than it does if a college student
gets tn trouble.

Mark Paulsonr We always kind of saw

[not being able to play because of
alcohol] coming but we never thought
about it. It was a big shock to us even
though we were kind of expecting it
before. It makes me mad, because I
don't think that we are a source ofany
problems at Gnnnell. People who
listen to our music and are heavy fol-
lowers of VIVID aren’t heavy dn'nkr
ers, and we certainly aren’t, I don’t
think that we were ever abig problem,
but we have to pay for the mistakes of
the few.
Wes- We were also going to play at
new student days in the forum with
Butterfltnk. We were going to play,
and then atthelastrninuteRachelBaar
decided that we shouldn't play be
cause we were high school students.
'But there warn 'talcoltolruﬂhe new
student days] concert:
Wes- No, there wasn‘t.
J.P. Mohan- The reason we didn't
play at new student days at the forum
was because Rachel Baar said. “these
are new students, and they are not
going to wanttoseekids who are close
to their age. or below their own age
play They never serve alcohol in the
South Lounge. Just add that to our list
ofreasons why we don‘t play places.
'Doer that mean you are prohibited
from everpbzyi'ng at iheforum?
1P.» No. actually we've been talking
to someone who might be able to ar-
range a gig for us here. lcan see us
maybe playing at new student days
next year. There still is a good possi-
bility ofplaying in the Forum this year.
Wes I guess we want to talk to
bands who would be interested in
doing a nollralcohol Show. That
would really help us out. That's the
only way that we can play.
