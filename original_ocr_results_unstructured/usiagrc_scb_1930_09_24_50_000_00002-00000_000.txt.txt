In the past tho medium by which this has heon

HOST TO THE PRESS

Sports writers have nlwavs llccll used to dis
comforts of various sorts. From cal days when
they watched the championship p lights from
a choice standing place to the night when they
sat through two hours of rain zlt Philadelphia to
see Tunney take a title from Dempsey, they have
suffered in quiet, Many institutions and persons
who beneﬁt by the work of the sports writers have
voluntarily taken it upon themselves to better the
lives of these individuals, however.

tiolls which he heaped upon them. Colleges have
also taken this matter into consideration and to
day in the U iversity of Minnesota stadium one
ﬁnds a heated, glass enclosed press box for football
games, with the representatives of the press rc-
ceivillg hot coffee during the game to put them in
an affable spirit. The press box at the new‘ Ifnie
varsity of Iowa stadium iS operated in llluch the
same fashion.

At Griullell the press box is not enclosed. The
box, as constructed, is not the most comfortable
place ill the world, but would serve well if
glass enclosed. A stiff hreezc, which llulnhs ones
ﬁngers and keeps him shivering through the game,
is scarcely conducive to handling a typewriter or
a telegraph key any more than necessary. Given
Llie option of a 200 or 400 word lead on his story,
the correspondent is much more likely to make it
the minimum number if he is working under ulr
favorable conditions.

Grinnell has been given more space ill middle
Western newspapers than the size of the college
merits, in the past. This has been largely due to
some outstanding teams, but with that there is the
ambition of the w iter to be considered. Glass cne
closures were promised for the press box last. year,
but did not arrive. They should be installed this
year, if for no other reason than to better Grille
nell’s reputation as an amiable host.

MEMORIZDI'G COLLEGE SONGS

While listening Saturday evening to the men’s
glee club leading ill the singing of college songs
at the general reception, everyone realized how
unfortunate it, is that the Alma Mater and battle
hymn are not better memorized. It would he splen-
did if all Grillnclliaus could Sing the college songs
when together.

In a number of colleges the learning of the
Songs is urged upon freshmen by the student com-
mittee. usually ll division of the student council
\vhich'has charge of freshman discipline. The fresh
who learn their lines are released from, say, carry-
ing matches.

A similar system at Grinllell would be highly
desirable. Ill a few years all the students would
know the verses. Moreovcr, the committee in
charge could nggest other desirable changes in
freshman plille.

REPORTING BY WIRELESS TELEPHONE
(From the Columbia Missourian)

A new chapter in newspaper reporting was written
last week when the editor of the New York Times called
his correspondent at Buenos Aires by wireless telephone
and asked him for a story on the Argentine revolution.
Cable dispatches had been censored and the editor
wanted an unhampered account from an eye witness
He got it. He called every day. Finally he got an inter—
view with the provisional president, General Urihuru.

Aside from the advantage gained by an enterprising
individual in checking the accuracy of his reports, his
action may herald a customary way of the near future
for an editor to communicate with his foreign reporter.
Once a new and successful instrument is introduced in
newsgathering, it generally comes to stay.

Not so long ago, city editors were frowning upon
the typewriter. Today every successful newspaper ﬁnds
time saving machinery indispensable. The time may
come when foreign correspondents will “call the desk”
every day as local reporters do. The innovation will
prove costly, but newspapers serving the public interest
stop at no expense to get the news, quickly and accur-
ately. The greatest gainer is the American reading
public.
