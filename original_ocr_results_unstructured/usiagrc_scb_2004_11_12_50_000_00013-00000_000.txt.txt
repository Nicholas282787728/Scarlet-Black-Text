“Why the hell are

diversity?"

Race, cont. from p. 12

Hence, the choice must be between two
equally qualiﬁed professors, one orwhoin would
contribute a unique background, with experieno
es distinct from those of a white, male professor.
Thus, academic ideals are not compromised by
aﬁirmritivc action policy and the college does not
hire, as the student states, “less competent faculty
because they’re disadvantaged."

Most importantly, the student‘s iemarks pro-
vide examples of whirc privilege here on Grins
nell's campus, After deﬁning aftmuarivc action,
he claims that white professors are “replaced" by
professors of color and he asks: “Does it make
sense to hire a less-qualified applicant based on
race, though?” No, it doesn't; but it ﬂso doesn't
make sense to assume a professor of color is
lesser qualiﬁed and hired because “race is elevated
above all other factors.” The most evident privi-
lege is that a white professor's qualiﬁcations are
NEVER questioned because of their skin color.
Whire professors need not justify why they were

hired, while a professor of color must always re
main cognizant that some people may suspect
they were hiied because of their mcc. A second
privilege involves [his student's ability to bring up
issues of race and racism and then choose to put
them aside when he wants. He biought up the
topic of race in a public forum, Plans, but after
a few days erased the entirety of his updates and
dialogue with the response “edited due to reals
ization of previously massive drunken state." By
initiating dialogue but quickly ending it, he has
exercised his ability to Maui! when to bring up and
confront race related topics, whereas many people
of color cannot choose where luid when they cons
fiont dies: issues. Finally, diis student demon-
strated a white privilege in his ability to bring up
issues of race in a public forum without accusas
tions of stlfsinterest. As he replied to Sarah Lu
about his attendance at Grinnell events focused
on diversity, he claims that his “ability to relate to
others ofa different race has nothing to do with
[her] talks, nor [her] selfssel'ving, arrogant pres
rentions to equality.” While he accuses her ofbe-
ing self-serving, he does not need to worry about
facing similar accusations,

The purpose ofthis letter is to raise awareness
about discussions ofrace on this campus.

Speaking constructively
about racial diversity

A pervasive assumption on this campus
presumes that Grinnell students are com~
parativcly “liberal”: they understand issues
of diversity. Within this assumption lies
grievous error. On Nov. 2nd, a Griunell snr
dent started posting uninformed statements
about affirmative action and faculty hiring
policies that reflected a great deal of preju-
dice. While Brad expressed his opinions in a
markedly abrasive manner via Plans,1’m sure
other Grinnellians share opinions similar to
his but aren’t as forthright about them.

We should presume that Griniiell stu-
dents are taught to use their academic skills
to access useful information. This same stus
dent demonstrated the error in that assump
tion.

At the top ofhis Plan on November 2nd,
Brad posted “Thoughts (all students, par
ticularly minorities...)," thus directing his
questions at students, speciﬁcally trying to
illicit responses from minorities. He asks,
“Why the hell are we so focused on ‘diver-
sity’?“

Minority students don't have to ans
swer Brad’s question. President Osgoods
statement on diversity already answered it.
[bltp.‘//www. ci-i ii iii/I. trio/offirtr/prrri (ltnl/
diocrrzly/rtrz/mwm. In addition, the Fab
ulty Diversity Initiative states, “Diversity
enriches the educational experience of each
and every student and faculty member. We
therefore consider increasing diversity a
College priority" [bh‘ﬁV/wauao Grmm’ll m'zi/
miter/pi :lrdcnl/lli’vei lity/fnzdiwl in ili/zliw],

There's no indication that the wealth of
texts on afﬁrmative action, race, and diver-
sity easily available in Burling inﬂuenced
Brad’s arguments. Instead of using the Inc
ternet to find relevant analyses on ilffu’mn’
tive action, notably the opinion Justice San~
dra Day O'Connor delivered in the Cr'uller‘
Supreme Court case, Brad used the Internet
to post uninformed, abrasive statements on

his Plan.

Meeting deadlines

This rant is about something we all know and
most likely hate with a passion: DEADLINES. Why
is it that the dates and times by which things need
to be done evaporate so randomly and unexpectedly
from our neurons? Perhaps this has something to do
with the fact that there are probably more things due
in a year than there are Hindu deities, including the
minor ones. So, for the record, ifI was supposed to
do something for you and this knowledge was sucked
into the giant black hole in my brain that conveniently
doesn't attract brain sludge like Britney Spears songs,
know that I'm sorry, and that your deadline is in the
good company of Sthrodingcr's equation and the
signers ofthc Declararion oflndependcncc.

UPPER-case/class, but are made to feel inferior,
worthless, and powerlessjust as UPPER—case letters
are supposed to occupy the front-most pos' ‘on in
