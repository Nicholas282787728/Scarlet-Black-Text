Vote Hatzfeld

After a careful review of statements of intent from the four
candidates in Monday's Student Government Association vice presidential
race, we have concluded tltatjunior Dave Hatzfeld is best suited to hold the
position While the other three candidates all have strong positives in their
election platfroms, we believe that Hatzfeld's proven leadership abilities
and his strong commitments to Judicial Counciul reform. multiculturalism
and the ideals ofthe liberal arts college make him the bestchoicc in this off-
schedule election.

We are not SGA's mouthpiece

For the information of our readers, we have made an edi tonal
decision not to run, in their cntireties, the statements of intent from candi-
dates in the upcoming Student Government Association vice preSidential
election. We have instead decided to do what most newspapers do when
covering elections: we have assigned a reporter to follow the events,
research the candidates and report on the issues.

While theScorletchlack has inthepastservcdasaforum forbland
reproductions of candidates‘ personal statements, we are in no way required
to do so. Such procedure is notjoumalism. and we do notbelieve that it does
any major service for the campuscommunity. Since statements of intentare
posted on bulletin boards all over campus, we believe that we can do a better
service to our readers by providing some sort of digest and analysis of a
political event rather titan simply acting as the candidates’ mouthpiece.

SGA President Angela Onwuachi has taken exception to our
policy, but we would like to ask why it is assumed that the campus press
should simply print anything that the student government sends our way. It
has been implied to us that since we receiveSGA funding we should, by that
very fact, function as the ofﬁcial press organ of the current president. We
disagree. The very suggestion makes us cringe. and it is this very type of
threat that has motivated our new business policy of slashing production
costs and incrwsing ad revenue so that we are spending as little ofour SGA
budget as possible. But money is not the point. Whether we are funded by
SGA ornot,ihispapcrshould,asamatterofprinciple,beallowcd to function
independently of political control from within SGA.

The Scarlet 8: Black is published weekly by and for the students of
Grinnell College, and neither by nor for the SGA president and cabinet. nor
for any SGA election candidates. Candidates and ofﬁce holders are
encouraged to contactour news staff when they have something to report, or
they may send brief letters to the editor. And we will, of course. be in touch
when events demand it.

Fisher thinks about elections

THINKEFt’ 'S
CORNER

by Gareth Fisher

If you were afraid life here might
get a little boring from time to time
because we're in the middle oflowa,
you can rest assured. There is ncvera
dullmomenthere. Consequently,we
don’t always got a chance to reflect
onwhatwearedoingwhileitisgoing
on. I hope this corner of the Scarlet
and Black will help to compensate
for that.

Overthesummer,l watched
along with I‘m sure many
Grinnellians the events surrounding
the upcoming elections. Tire last
timeapoliticalelectioncamellirough
Grinnell, a quarter of the campus
marched downtown, caused a win-
dow in the Grinncll Republican ofr
fice to cave in, and scared the hell out
of the candidate, who also happened
tobcthcincurnbetitgovemoroflowa.

Woll, unless Dan Quayle
plans to talk about “family values” in
South Lounge, I don’t think that will
happen again. Nonetheless. srilce
Grinnellians are notorious for their

political interest and activity, and
since this is the closest race in some
time, l‘ve no doubt we’ll be plied
with political propoganda by Novcmr
her. I have vivid images of students
screamingin dorm loungeseverytime
a blue lightcomcs up on that map of
the United States behind Peter
Jennings on election night. Would
our iirue be better spent? Is this
election worth caring about? An
introduction to political science
course would inform that our vote
has almost no practical political ef-
fect. Even the votes of everyone on
campus or anyone who could be
reached by political campaigns ema-
nating from hcrcarcrclatively insigr
nificant. Many political scientists
would argue that the outcome of
Novcmbcr’s election will not matter
because there is no longer any real
choice between the Republicans and
Democrats. Any candidate’s real
performance as president is based on
political influences from lobbyists,
notvoters. Thereforevotingand for
the most part political campaigning
is irrational.

This may be so. ltccriainly

Willi a better understanding of the

It clarifies bclicfs. It allows us to
participate and socialize with others
with similar beliefs. Political active

prive ourselves of a chance for self-
expression even if that includes not
voting ifwe are dissatisfied with the
government, not because we believe

rational as an end in itself, even if it
fails as a means to an end.

McClelland criticizes editorial

To the editor:

The S&B has gotten off on
the wrong foot this semester in its
September 4 editorial on “inadvertr
enl." plagiarism. First, in offering an
opinionaboutaparticularplagiarism
case, the 5&8 cannot have been in
possession of all the facts, because
such proceedings are strictly confi-
dcntlal.

Second, by suggesting that
plagiarism isn't plagiarism if you
didn't mean to do it, the 5&8 staff
apparently neglected to inform them-
selves abotit college policies on aca-
demic honesty, e.g., this statement
onpage lZofthe SludontHandbook:
“Even when there may be no eon-
scious effort to dcceive, failure to
make appropriate acknowledgment
may constitute plagiarism.” i would
encourage the staff of the 8&8 (and
every Grinnell student!) to read care
fully the infonnaiion on academic
honesty on pages 11-14 of the Stu-
dent Handbook.

1 fear that some students

may have gotten the impression from
your editorial that “inadvertent“ pla~
giarisni is a trivial offense, some-
thing tc be L’iken lightly, As a mem-
ber of Subcommittee on Academic
Honesty of the Cotnmittee on Aca-
demic Standing, I disagree. In my
view, all plagiarism is serious. Nei»
ther carelessness nor ignorance is a
valid excuse.

I hope thatin the future you
will think the issue through more
carefully before you pick up your
editorial pen.

Kent McClelland
Associate Professor of Sociology

Doty on 8&3

...I think the“S Sc B” should work ti
deserve sotne kind ofrespoct by im
proving quality and content. An:
college publication should be prour
ofwhat itproduces. Ilook forward it
the day the “S & B" is no longer:
joke on campus.
