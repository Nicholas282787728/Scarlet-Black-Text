Do you have candles left over from
last year's candlelight march and
don’t know what to ‘do with them?

Are you battled to find yourself
agreeing with President Nixon that
indeed “two wrongs do not make a
right" and that “there can be no
whitewash at the White House?”

[)0 you find yourself sitting in your
room, saying to the Nixon admin-
istration and the American elector-
ate, ”I told you so.”

Are you finding it difficult to keep
track of who is in, who is out, who
wanted out, who got kicked out, and
who done it?

Do you find yourself forgetting who
you voted for last November? Or
what he looks like? Or where he is',7

Do you find yourself siltingthrough
antiquated anti-war literature
changing the word “Vietnam” to
"Cambodia?”

Are you finally finding time toturn
to your school work and discover
ing that it’s not all that stimulating
anyway?

Are you fed up with rhetoricalquese

In these days of glitter music and
what my friend indelicately butaptly
terms “limp dick rock," it’s goodto
have a band like J, Geils still plar
ying some real rock and roll. on
fortunately, their latest release on
Atlantic does not quite fulfill the
promise of their first three Al-
bums.

Bloodshot contains nine songs, se-
ven of which are originals penned

by keyboardist Seth Justman and We
calist Peter Wolf, and while many
of them are real movers, the over-
all impression is that J, Geils has
failed to transcend its R,ELB./Elues
influences, and is presenting re-
workings of older material rather
than developing new forms.

On their earlier albums, partice
uiarly Full House, which was taken
from a live performance, J. Geils
played exciting, tight renditions of
early Blu s and Run. songs,

They apparently are trying to add
more original numbers to their
repetoire, a logical step, and Bi—
oodshot is a very respectable first
step in this direction One wishes,

SGA has been feverishly trying to
concoct a rationale for this exer-
cise in leisure domain. it is diffir
cult to convince students that this
country is suffering from a trivoe

unite in protest against the sober,
staid policies of the present admin-
istration, Not this soon aftei‘Nixon's

In spite of this rejuvenation ofridr
iculousness generated by our Press

they exist, The spring farce isane-
cessity if Grinnell is to vindicate
its reputation as more than a later
tory.

It seems that the Grinnell come
munity fell flat on its collective face
in the Punch Line Contestf It is pain-
ful to admit that not one entry was
submitted.

So, SGA, in its infinite wisdom, has
decided that this sopilistry must be
laid to rest. And now is the time,
before Grinnell is labelled “The
Rest Home of the Midwest.”

After all, President Leggett once
called Grinnell “the greates open-
air asylum in the country," Our
reputation is on the line.

tunity to exonerate our name,

however, that the band would move
into new ‘territory and, like the
Rolling Stones, use their influences
to take another step in that music
we call rock and roll, rather than
write in essentially an older form.

They begin to approach this cone
cept in the longer version of their
single, Give it To Me, which come
bines contemporary rhythm with an
older, blues sound, leaving no doubt
in my mind that tile band is quite
capable ofproducing original matere
fat of striking quality,

Beyond the Criticism of their wrr
iting, Bloodshot remains a compee
tent, interesting album, perhaps la-
cking in the intense drive of their
earlier efforts, but still a worthy
production in itself. J. Geil’s guitar
style has expanded to include bottles
neck, and Magic Dick’s harpplaying
is as good as ever.

Stephen Bladd and Danny Klein
form a tight rhythm section, and
Peter Wolf’s vocals are as raunchy
as ever, Bloodshot is a good ale
bum, make no mistake, though if
you have no other J, Geil’s Band
albums, it may prove more pro-
fitnble to buy one of their earlier
releases to find out where the gr-
oup is coming from,

commitments prevent me from spr
ending as much time as I should
on each article. Writing any kind

Race: Black And White

by Gregg Datfner

Racism, in its widest form, is the
theory which ascribes to a man's
genetic lineage moral, social orpol-
itical significance. It maintains that
the content of a man's mind is deter-
mined by inherited physical factors
beyond his control. And thus it means
that a man is not to be judged by
his own character and actions but
by the character and actions of his
ancestors.

Racism is a form of determinism,
and as such it denies two fundar
mentals of man's nature: reason
and choice. Racism is the lowest
form of collectivism, and is most
clearly associated in both its fullest
expression and increased popularity
as the handemaiden 0f statism and
brute force.

The popularity of racism is rooted
in the racist's sense of his own file

ieriority, it, like all collectivism,
is the desire for the unearned, It
is an attempt to eliminate the he»
cessity of individual judgment and
responsibility. It is a confession of
one’s own vacuity and is indicative
of the advocate’s failure to earn his
own self worth, It is a quest for
automatic, unachieved pride.

Most racists are men who have
never earned a sense of personal
identity, men who can claim no in-
dividual distinction. In their quest
to take that which they did not ace
hieve, they seek the allusion of
“collective superiority."

Collectivism is a creed which ma»
intains that the individual has no
rights and that his life belongs to
the group, The group -» the state,
the nation, etc. in turn many sac-
rifice him as they choose for their
own ends. Statism is the political
corollary of collectivtsm precisely
because the only way to implement
such a doctrine is by means ofcoerv
cion, It is no accident that as col—
lectivism is on the rise so is race
ism.

Since statism is just the rule of
brute force, and since there is no
justification for the absolute State,
racism serves as its justification.
Those who oppose racism yetaccept
collectivism and statism are fighting
a hydra.

The only cure for racism isaphil-
osophy of individualism and its pol—
itical corollary, laissez»faire capi~
talism. Individualism holds that

every man is an independent sov-
ereign being possessing the right
to his own life. It holds that civ-
ilized society can only be achie-
ved by recognizing individual ri-
ghts, and that it is only the indiv-
idual's own worth as an individual
that counts. On a free market only
the attribute of productive ability
mattersﬁand the purist line of
ancestors can’t make a difference
Capitalism Judges a man by his own
ability and ambition and in this way
rewards rationality,

In the United States the obvious
racial problem was that oi the
Negroes originally perpetrated by
the agrarian feudalistic south. Nor-
thern capitalism was responsible
for destroying the institution of
serfdom and slavery, However as we
bear witness to the obliteration of
capitalism by increasing statistlaws
and policies, racismis also growing!
The economics. of the, New ,oeal apd
liberal legislation has created aninr
stitutionalized racism.

So long as racism was practiced
by individuals it was doomed, be-
cause racism is bad business. As
cheap labor, Negroes would have
entered the labor market and worked
their way into the system. The inter
vention of the government in the
market resulted in the destruction
of the very mechanisms required {or
an oppressed minority to gain en-
trance into that economy,

Making Eco-tracks In Right Direction

by Fran Cutler

Since Amtrak took over most of
the nation’s rail passenger ser-
vice in 1971, train travel has star-
ted to make a comeback, Even with
fewer trains, ridership has increa-
sed. What makes this somewhat
remarkable is that Amtrak accom-
plished this Wlthpaltry iederaliund-
ing and aging equipment on rail-
roads that did not want passenger
trains on their tracks in the first
place

However, there are indications on
Capitol Hill that President Nixon
is going to lake the advice of his
assistants in‘the Office of the Man-
agement and Budget (OMB) who want
to out off funding for Amtrak. Last
year Amtrak received $170 million
from Congress, but Nixon says he
wants to Cut Amtrak funding to $100
million by 1974, The feeling in the
White House, and specifically in the
OMB, whiclt Roy Ash rules, is that
“Little good and much harm can
come of a public subsidy.”
Although administration officials
argue that the system cold be tr-
uncated, Amtrak Chairman and
President Roger Lewis does not
lielieve abandonment of significant
protions of the present 22,000 mile
system is the proper solution Lewis
asserts, “What’s important is to
increase ridership.”

When Lewis goes before Congress
on June 30 to file his budget pro-
posals, he will be armed with suf-

ficient evidence to defend the Arm
trak requests. He need only cite
that Amtrak has relieved the raile
roads of staggering passenger los-
ses and, as Trains editor David P.
Morgan observed in the February

17h goo-M

issue, ”has out those losses; it has
reversed the decline of rail riders
ship; and it has proved (according
to a Louis Harris poll) that Amerr
icans want and will pay for passenr
ger trains." In addition, Amtrak is
recognized as a necessarytravelope
tion on economic, ecological, leisure
and/or trailicecongestion grounds.
In spite of administration pressure,
Congress is likely to be friendly to
Amtrak and appropriate the funds
the system wants and needs, Sen-
ator Vance Harke (D-lnd.), chair-
man of the Senate Surface Trans—
portation Committee, which hears
arguments on funding for Amtrak,
says he is not altogether happy with
the system, yet it is better than
none. Says Harke, “Despite some
problems, I believe, with proper
effort by Amtrak management, suf-
ficient funds and more interest and
support form the White House. Am-

trak could meet the intense need
for rail service.” Other influential
legislators state flatly, that they
will oppose any Administration at—
tempts to cut funding for the Arm
trak system.

knowing that they have a sym
pathetic ear in Congress, Amtrak
officials will probably ask for more
funding. According to one Amtrak
staffer, funds have been the core
poration‘s big problem. Until re-
cently, the system had only enough
money to refurbish old equipment,
something Amtrak'staffers blame on
the White House and 0MB. ror exe
ample, last year the Amtrak core
poration wanted $260 millionto cove
er costs of operation and to buy
new equipment in its second year,
but the Administration said it would
approve only $170 million Amtrak
took the lower request to Congress,
which appropriated that amount and
indicated it might have approvedthe
larger figure if Amtrak had asked,
Now Amtrak officials are looking at
funding a different way. OneAmlrak
staffer has been quoted as saying,
“Our mistake was in not telling
Congress what the full loaf of br-
ead would cost We should have
bucked the OMB. We didn't, and we
lost our credibility with Congress
That won't happen this time.” I
can only hope that she/he is correct
for passenger trains provide the no»
tion with the most ecologically sound
form of mass transportation.
