Board Control Plan
Thursd ay

Members of all staffs of The Scar-
lct and Black will mcct at 7 p. m.
Thursday on the second floor of
Alumni Recitation hall to consider
the ire-organization of the present
system of newspaper control in Crin-
ncll.

A proposed student control board

, was discussed at a meeting two weeks
ago and Kenneth Clayton, editor, ap-
pointed a committee to propose a
definite, workable arrangement for
consideration by staff members.

Proposes Incorporation

The plan proposed by this group,
which includes Roberta Vance, Mir-
iam Spaulding. and James Morrison,
will be discussed by staff members
tomorrow night. If it is approved it
will be placed before the faculty and
the student council.

‘ Rc-organization suggested by the

committee calls for the incorporation '

of The Scarlet and Black under an
educational, non-profit sharing plan
with capital stock with shares of no
par value. These are to be distributed
among controlling agcncies, Sigma
Delta Chi, Theta Sigma Phi, the star
dent council, and the college.
Student Majority

Management will be in the hands
of a board of directors composed» of
seven students and two college offic-
ials. The representation will include
two members from Sigma Delta Chi,
two from Theta Sigma Phi, one from
the student council, the business
manager of the college, the head of
the department of journalism, and
the editor and business manager of
The Scarlet and Black.

The hoard will elect the editor and
business manager and may remove
them by two-thirds vote if the work
is not satisfactory. The editor and
business manager will each receivc
a salary and on per cent of the net
profits, the remaining 50 per cent be-
ing placed in a sinking fund,-

Editor Has Control

The editor will have direct control
over the paper’s policies and both
the editor and business manager will
be empowered to select department
heads. Journalism students automat-
ically become staff members and
specific hours each week will be de-
voted to work on the paper. in place
of present laboratory work.

The proposed plan provides that

they rank among the leading outfits
in the middle west. The Crinnell mile,
relay team and a distance medley
squad were the only Pioneer entries
in the annual Minnesota Relay classic,
but both placed in their respective
events.

The medley quartet, consisting of
Murphy, Thomas, Pfeiffer, and Pil-
brow finished in second place behind
Wisconsin, after Murphy had started

the half-mile leg of the race, finish-

Grated to erase the Hawkeye lead, but
their efforts were not good enough
to beat out the Wisconsin team.

The mile relay quartet, altho it
finished in third place, had victory in
its grasp, since the three teams,
Iowa, Wisconsin, and Grinncll, were
bunched at the finish. Pour baton
passes in both races proved costly
to the Pioneers.
