calocagarhia.

Calocagathia's program Friday
alter-noon was opened by a very
pleasing instrumental solo by
Helen Millerd. The subject ot
the afternoon was “Western Lit-
erature." Miss Jennie Hartwell
spoke of Will Carletoniof his lite
and various works. She then read
some of his “Farm Ballads,"which
ieature of her talk was especially
enjoyed.

Miss Ruth Brown gave a sketch
of Eugene Field, with a descripr
tion of his home and household
treasures, dwelling especially‘upe
on his love for children and for his
family. This was Miss Brown's
ﬁrst appearance on the society
program. Margaret McCormack
read a paper upon Riley and his
works.

Miss Smith, who has recently
come to Grinnell as a teacher of
elocution. recited from Riley—
"An Oldsweetheart oi Mine,” and
Fields “An Usurper,“ and as an
encore, “There Little Girl, Don’t
Cry,” from Riley. Miss smith

in reading for them.

Thecxtemporancous workupon
current topics, by Misses Hand.
Starr, Martlla Fulton and Ethel
Graham was rather better than the
ordinary. Miss Fulton, especially.
shelved a large knowledge of her
subject and spoke very easily.

While the program as a whole
was a little too long, it was rather
above the average society pro-
gram and was very much enjoyed.
There will be no session Jan. 27,

The program was pleasantly
opened with a bright pianoselect-
ion by Miss Viena Chase. after
which was read a very wellrprer
pared paper on the “Romantic
Drama in Europe" by Miss Mary
l‘ate. l‘he purpose of tile paper
was to give a short review of the
situation ofthe Romantic Drama
in the Carly part of this century
and above all to show that this
movement was a movement of
emancipation.

The Italian, German and Span-
ish drama was quite thoroughly
reviewed, but the French school
received the most important place
with its two leaders, Victor Hus
go and Alexander Dumas, while
the ﬂow of fine art tragedies has
never ceasedinay has always
been abuntlantilt still remains
true that the dramatic \vorl' done
during this period has been tar
inferior to other kinds of literary
activity.

Miss Risser appeared for the
First time on the Ellis ﬂoor with a
three rnrnute speech, upon the
”Disclosures Made by Gen
Miles." Miss Kisser was very
much at her case and promises to
be a helpful member.

M'iss oir's talk upon the "Drey-
tus Case“ gave a clear outine of
the situation and a gleat deal of
information.

expressions were bright and quite
recognizable.

The Cornell Register which has

Mr. Carleton.

In his lecture Friday evening
Mr. Carleton utilized the general
idea of the Drama of Human Life
to unify the parts and serve as a
broad setting for the various
scenes represented by selections
given trom his poems, The hear-
or did not receive the impression
of any clearly deﬁned purpose or
message, which indeed was not
what he went for, but rather to
hear and see the poet interpret
some of his own already familiar
verses. Known more largely to
his readers by his Fem Ballad:
and Farm 1,57;de than by his lat-
er work, there might have been a
slight regret that Mr. Carleton's
selections did not include the old
tavorites such as Betsy end 1 are
Our, etc. However the farm life
was quite generously given, per»
haps most effectively in Elder
Lamb. while the wider range of his
later work was represented in Pic—
nz': Sal/z, Hear 2/” Drum: Man/L
By. and others.

Tire proportion of verse and
anecdote was well maintained, the
latter consisting of a kind of run»
ning commentaryiserious, hur
morous, pathetic, upon the phases
otlite pictured in his poems.

Whatever may be said of the
technique of Mr. Carleton‘s verse,
one can hardly be out of sympa~
thy with its spirit. There is an
essential faith in the value of the
common life. an appreciation of
many’ of the ﬁner shades of char-
acter and a wholesome and cheer-
ing optimism tempered by some»
thing of a conservative tendency,
all uniting to make us generally
agree with him.

Mr. Carleton’s manner upon the
platform is noticeably free from
conventionality and restraint;
while not a skilful impersonator
there is a hearty and kindly sin-
cerity in his personality, which is
perhaps better than a more ﬁn-
ished artistic excellence.
