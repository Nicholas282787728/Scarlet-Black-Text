Iscnted at the Colonial Theatre Satur-
‘day. it is in three acts and the
scenes are laid in a country home on
‘Long island. The story or the play
deals with the tarclcal adventures oi

Iwith the evidence or an old indiscre-
ltion. The evidence in this case is a
pink chemise which he had unwr itLing-
ly shell to a beautiiul and charming
livrdow of whom he had been loud in
lIIlS bachelor days. This chemise was
unlortuliately inscribed lahel trom
lcar and the slightly jealous and
chceedingly mischcvious ilahcl threat—
ened to show it to Garry s Wife. Gar-i
pleaded, coaxed and caioled in an of»
“tort to get the chemise back, and
tinally decided to steal it More din
culties aruse than he dreamed of and
,in the course of his adventures, he
‘iound himscli in situation aster situa—

was iiually captured and Garry’s
trouble brought to an end, cannot be
divulged without detracting irom the
