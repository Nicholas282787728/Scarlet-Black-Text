ing' studied by only about
4,000 Americans, despite the
great demand ior translators
and other experts in the lang-
uage. in contrast, English is
being taught to at least iive
million Russians. ‘

Many or his ideas irom the
book also appear in the report

Studies project, or which K137 .

port, called “International Se-
curity: The Military Aspect," air
tracted much attention from

the American public following
the successiul launching oi two
Russian earth satellites and the
failure ot the U. S. Vanguard,

In his book, K mger said,
“Mankind has at its disposal
the means to destroy itselt at
the precise moment when
schisms among nations have
never been deeper and the
attempt to come to grips with
the horrors oi the new tech
