Gangsters, Tong War, Strikers
All in Day’s Work for Colbert

Rum-runners, hi-jackers, black-
mailei-s. and dope ﬁends played a

part in the reporting experiences of‘

Harry T. Brundidge, St. Louis. who
recounted his adventures before the
Iowa High School Press association
meeting here last fall, but thrilling
reporting experiences have also her
fallen one of Grinnell‘s own faculty
members, although Herschel M, Col-
bert, director of the journalism, was
loath to divulge them.

Upon being interviewed, Mr. Col—
bert admitted that before the World
war he was a reporter for a Chicago
paper, and had hobnobbed with gong-
sters, mingled with blackmailers, ar-
bitrated with strikers, and had even
been shadowed by a Chinaman. ”In
those days," he said. “gangsters
didn't use machine guns to mow down
their rivals, but fought it out with
pistols, like men. Consequently, we
reporters never feared the criminal
element, because we felt that they
knew our profession.”

Token foi- Ride

In this connection, he told of inter-
viewing a man who had been wound-
ed by a rival, and was accused of
ﬁring a fatal shot at his enemy. This
gangster sent word that he wanted
a reporter to get a statement from
him before he was arrested.

Reporter Colbert was ordered to go
down to a certain street corner and
stand there until he was picked up
by a cab. He was blinfdolded and
taken for a 30 minute ride, following
which he was led before the accused
man.'The blindfold was removed, and
he was given the statement. Mr. Col-
bert was then blindfolded again, and
returned to the corner where he had
ﬁrst been smnding.

Covered Strike

Another story covered by the Grin-
nell instructor during his reporting
days was a strike at the Corn pro»
ducts reﬁning plant, 20 miles beyond
Chicago suburbs. The editor informed
him that 10 or 15 people had been
killed at this strike and that the
leaders were allowing no one to en-
ter the plant.

The reporters ﬁrst went to the
strike leader, got his story, and sym-
pathized with him, Leaving some of
the reporters talking to the mob,
others went past the guards into the
main ofﬁce and talked to the super
intendent.

Cinnamon Troublesome

One of Mr. Colbert's trouhlesomc
experiences was that of being shadow-
ed by a Chinaman for three weeks.
At the time of a rival war between
the Hip Sing Tong clique and the On
Wongs, he was assigned an interview
with the Tongs' lawyer, a prominent
attorney, who could give him inside
information as to the cause of the
war.

The lawyer gave the reporter a.
note to deliver to one of the Tong
leaders at a popular cafe, Kin Joy
Lo. There he was taken to the kits
ehen and a private elevator deposited
him on the top floor where he met
the leader, a Well»educated China-
man.

"Shadoived Constantly"

Mr. Colbert printed as much of the
story as he dared, and the next af-
ternoon he was told that a Chinaman
had been waiting for him since morn-

ing. This man wanted to know Where

he got the story, since he was a rival
Tong who wanted the information.
“For three weeks I was shadowed
constantly by different Chlnamen,”
Mr. Colbert relates. “They often
asked where I learned this i ide
dope, and they kept it up until the
war ended.”

To take the regulation Turkish
bath is bad enough, but being forced
to take one in a hotel closet behind
Iadies' clothing is worse. To substan-
tiate this assertion, Mr. Colbert res
counts the most uncomfortable day
he ever Spent;m such a spot.

Badger Game Story

Chicago police were working on
a blackmailing ring composed of
three men and three women, who
had been operating for several
months. At social events the women
would ”vamp" rich men until their

companions broke up the scenes as
irate husbands.

On this particular afternoon the
‘chief invited two or three reporters
to watch the story “break and he
divided the party into three groups
‘One was stationed behind the dresser,
‘anotlier under the bed, and thethird
in the clothes closet.

“They were nonohnlant when at»
rested," said Mr. Colbert. “The womr
en were stunningly gowned, and they
asked permission to change
clothes before going to jail. We ex-
pected to get some good photographs
but the women came out dressed like
seruhwomen, which ruined our chanc-
e‘s of getting pictures.”
