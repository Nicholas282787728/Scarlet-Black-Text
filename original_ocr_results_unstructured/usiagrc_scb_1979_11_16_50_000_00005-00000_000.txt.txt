greatest human tragedy in the world
today," but as Americans, “we can do
better and we must do better.” Ken-
nedy believes Carter’s administrative
coordination on the problem has been
faulty, yet the previous head of that
project, tormei- Iowa Senator Dick
Clark, has recently detected to Ken-
nedy's side, certainly not adding to the
coordination, and perhaps subtracting
from it.

At least a portion oi Kennedy‘s
troubles stemmed from his indecision
over which audience to address: Grin-
nell College, Iowa as a whole, or the
television cameras. Unsure of what
audience reaction would be, Kennedy
said, “I have called for a two year
moratorium on the issuance of
licenses for the construction of nuclear
plants." When the audience reacted
with its greatest applause ol the talk,
he made sure to add the line: “No new
plants should be built unless and until

we can be certain they are sate,”
trom his prepared statement.

Kennedy's speech ultimately railed;
he missed what the crowd was looking
for-,jsslies and answers, His Grinnell
statement typifies the common Sense
political talks made by politicians
everywhere,

When a group of individuals started
clapping and shouting: “We want Ken—
nedy, we want Kennedy," beiore his
arrival, they were booed and jeered, -
illustrating the tact that the majority
were not in attendence to hail Kenr
nedy but to gain his insight into the
issues,

At least in this respect, the senator
should be accorded low marks, Carter,
Kennedy said at the beginning [If his
speech, ”likes to claim he tackles the
tough issues, but most of the time he
misses the tackles." In Grinnell, '
however, Kennedy was never even on
the field.

Search for State Bank robbers continues

(tom the Gnnnell HeroldrReglster

Federal and local authorities were
continuing to search Thursday for a
rural Poweshiek County couple for
questioning in connection with the
theft of $62,000 from the Gi‘innell State
Bank late Sunday or early Monday.

The Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, Grinnell police, and the
Poweshiek County sheriff’s office were
seeking Dawn Kriegel, 21, an
employee in the banks’s bookkeeping
department, and her husband Daniel,
24.

Although no charges had been tiled,
FBI agents obtained a search warrant
in Federal District Court in Des
Molnes and Conducted a search of the
Krlegels' house, which is located in
rural Montezuma

it was reported that a search or the
Kl'iegcl home indicated that lights in
the house had not been turned oil. nor
had an electric blanket. $600 cash was

found hidden in the bathroom. The
cash reportedly did not match any
taken from the bank ,

Grinnell State Bank president F, Ad»
dison Jones Said that “there's no way
we can accuse her of wrongdoing at
this time," In fact, authorities were
discussing the possibility that the
Kriegels might have been forced to
open the vault and might be
“hostages" or someone else.

Bank teller Margaret Wise arrived
for work at about 7:45 a.m. Monday to
find the door adjacent to the, parking
lot unlocked. Authorities were notified,
and it was quickly determined that
"teller cash" was missing from a por-
tion of the vault not under time lock.

Bank president Jones said that the,
thelt probably took place sometime
late Sunday night or early Monday
morning, since the bank’s janitor had
wurked‘until about 11:30 p.m. There
was no sign ot forcible entry. Dawn

Kriegel did have a key to the bank,
Jones added.

“The bulk of the cash was well
secured under time lock,” he Said.
“The teller cash, unfortunately, isn’t
as well protected.” That money is in a
separate part of the vault, he explain
ed, Jones described the money as
“working cash” which included
receipts trom Saturday’s bank
business. it is the cash used by tellers
at their windows.

Kriegel had been employed by the
bank for about a year, Jones said, and
she had never caused “previous prev
blems.”

The Kriegels‘ car, a 1976 green
Volkswagen Beetle, which was miss-
ing since the robbery, was found
Thursday in the 1100 block of Crocker
St. in Des Moines, parked in a lot ad~
jacent to a retirement complex. The

area is near the Greyhound Bus depot
in the capital city.

PABX busy buzz a hang up I

by tesley Williams

It's 3:30 on a pleasant Sunday even-
ing, time tor you make that weekly
phone call to the lolks back home, Or
perhaps you’ve deClded to order a bite
irorn Peppercoi-n's to ward off the late
night munchies, In any case, you amr
ble over to the telephone, conridently
dial “9" for an outside line, and
hear. .a busy signal. "What the heck's
wrong with this thing” you exclaim,
slamming down the receiver In
disgust.

Probably nothing That maddening
little buzz simply means that all oi the
ingoing/outgoing lines, or ‘tl‘unks,’ as
they're Called, are in use. ll, in the
midst of your teeth-grinding rage, you
decide to call the operator [or help,

you've wasted your time “We’re
always getting calls irom students
complaining because they can't get an
outside line," says switchboard super-
visor Virginia Blackwell ,
“Unlortunately, there's nothing we
can do Even emergency calls can't
always be placed during the rush
periods lithe trunks are busy, they‘re
busy."

The problem is the relatively small
number of outside lines “We have 16
incoming/outgoing trunks and a
seventeenth which can be used only
for outgoing calls," Blackwell ex-
plains, This means that no more than
17 conversations between on and off
campus people can he going on at a
time. That’s not very many, consider-

ing the number of students at Grin-
nell. With 1200 people using the same
phone system, it is surprising that any
outside calls are placed at'all.

or course, not everyone is trying to
dial out at the same time. “During the
8 am to 4 pm. shilt we mostly get
business calls for faculty,” says
Blackwell “It’s on weekends and
weekday evenings, when students are
calling parents or offrcampus friends,
that it really gets tight,"

Students in this pOSItirtn can do lit-
tle, except hang‘up and try again. Yet
there are ways to keep such crunches
