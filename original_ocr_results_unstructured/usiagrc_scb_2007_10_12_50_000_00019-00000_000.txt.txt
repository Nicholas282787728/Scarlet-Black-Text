Dominant tennis team heads to conference

ln' DRAKE Barrow

The Pioiiccrwomen‘s tennis team has been
one of Grinnell's under the radar success sto-
ries during the past few years. Having not lost
a conference match in more than three years,
the Pioneers quietly go about dominating the
conference.

When this weekend’s conference tourna-
ment begins in Madison, the women will look
to take home their fourth consecutive Midwest
Conference title.

Considering that they have only lost six
matches out or a possible 54 against confer
ence opponents, their expectations are cer—
tainly realistic. It’s a bit alarming, though, that
the Pioneers ended the regular season on their
weakest note, a sea victory over Beloit College
on Sunday.

“I don't think we should be worried about
the margin otvictory, necessarily," said Lindsay
Smith '09. “What's important is that we won.”

Undefeated in matches against their half
of the conference, St. Norbert is expected to
pose the greatest threat to the Pioneer wom—
en’s quest for a four-peat. But before giving up
three points to Beloit, the women dominated
St. Norbert 8s1.“I think St. Norbert was tired
after their first match,” says Margaret Block

’08, noting that the Pioneers were fresh against
the tired Vikings. “They’ll deﬁnitely step it up
at conference."

If an upset takes place this weekend, it
will likely occur at no. is singles and no, 1
doubles.Yes, the Pioneers are most vulnerable
at the top, but this speaks more to the overall
depth of the team than to a legitimate weaks
ness.

Over the course ofthe season, the Pioneers
have recorded a 55»18 record in singles play, a
.753 winning percentage. The no. 1 doubles,
on the other hand, is a legitimate weakness,
winning only two ofthcir six matches against
conference opponents. Still, the Pioneers are a
tough total package.

“our success is because we have a great
team," says no. 1 singles player Camila Alarcon
'08. “No one else in our conference has seven
top players that could play [anywhere]?

The Pioneers open up against Carroll on
Friday, and if they win, they will take on the
winner of the match between St. Norbert and
Lake Forest. The team’s expectations are set.
“I am 100 percent sure we are going to win
conference this weekend,” says Alarcon. “We
are the team to beat and none of the teams

 

have the depth we do."

Stop the real master chokers: the columnists

Another year, another Yankees loss in the ALDS, another
round of news stories about how Alex Rodriguez is a master
choker.

Unfortunately, this is the current state of sports columnists.
Nevermind tliatlorge Posada, and Derek Jeter played poorly or
that ChieneMing Wang was absolutely shelled in two outings,
the true story is how this “supposed"MV'P didn't belt 12 home
runs, have an OPS of over 3000 and carry his teain,JeffVan
Gundy style, into the next round.

The saddest part about all of this
is how predictable the news cover
age was, it was like predicting the
Cubs being swept; who could pose
sibly be mistaken?

I guarantee seveial columns rip-
ping A—Rod were started before he
went 2 for 5 with a home run in Game 4. That sickens me.
What exactly do we get out or reading about 95 poi-cent of
sports columnists? Certainly not entertainment.

All you see are boring, repetitive aiticles that can’t take a
stand against anything original. “Really?! You think the DH
goes against what baseball should be? Do tell." It’s that or col-
umns about current events that blow everything out ofpropors
non.

Just look at ESPN columnist Tuesday Morning matter-
backs response to the Belichick scandal. Writer Gregg Eastern

Jordan Kujala '09 .
Minnesota Miraclqun fill“(if:‘ZSA'Z'VZfif‘t’iiéﬂﬁié‘ﬁt‘;

brook stated, at length, that because ofthe cheating scandal the
“NFL is on the precipice of blowing its status as the country‘s
favorite sport," But I guess the past month has proven him
right. Belichick is on the verge of being fired, and television
ratings {or pro rootbali are tanking. Roger Goodelrs undoubt-
edly worried about being oiitdrawn by Wednesday's Rangers
Islanders game on versus,

In an even more ridiculous statement, Eastcrbrook went
on to compare “Spygate” or “Bellis
cheat" to Watergate. Not onlv is that
an affront to Beliehick and all logic,
but it is an affront to Nixon and the

in his administration. I mean, there

was i regul zed camera filming

and the Patriots handed ovei all of their tapes; Nixon would
nevei do that.

1 don't want to be like those people, 1 don’t want to be like

Jay Mariotn or Mark Japinga (mulialinhaha) using unfounded

allegations and yellow journalism, all while claiming that any

negative response is “making me more famous." (Edirm-‘r Nora

Gundy responded to a newspaper column by holding up the
newspaper and yelling, “This article embarrasses me to be in-
volved in athletics." Well, it embarrasses me to be even tangent
tially related to the world or sports journalism. Did you read
the article that caused it? It made Peter King look like Bill
Simmons circa 2003. '

Apparently, this is what we get from those with “access" to
the actual stars of the game: connections between their mothers
feeding them chicken and the reason they aren’t starting next
situiday To invoke Potter Stewart, “I know bad writing when
i see it.”

Hell, I don’t even want to be writing this. I would much
rather write an NHL preview, No one cares about hockey, but
it would let me compare Marian Gaborik to Fred Taylor, and
who doesn't want that?

But continually writing previews is intellectually lazy, ale
most is lazy as writing a piece on how Major League Baseball
needs a hard silaiy cap,or how gritty Darin Erstad is—he was a
ptintei at Nebraska! But it lcasr they would hopefully be more
entertaining.

I’m not going to make the statement that I will never write
a cliche’d column, or make a declaration of principles like Im
Charles Kane, only to break them almost iminediatelv. Im
human, Im going to write an overrated/underrated column at
some point But I will say this: if there is an opportunity to
compare VladislavTretiak to Greg Oden I will take it, even if
I have to wait until next vear.
