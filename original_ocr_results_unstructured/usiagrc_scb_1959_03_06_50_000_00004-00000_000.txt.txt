a Challenge Not To Be ignore-d

*“Tlle AfrorAsian Peoples: Problems ‘alid Aspir
, .oyidcs an unusual challenge and opportunity for (lrinnell
sludeiits this weekend.

 

in our ll y»to-day classroom-dorm Unionve. once our
eption and understanding of the colitelnporaly conflicts
lg between the nations of the world cannot help but

be mine confused and meaningless to a great extent.

Obviously, the clearest insight into the whole’ of the ill-
telnational situation or the Afro—Asian bloc specifically
would be obtained through a vocation de'llilig with these
p:'ol;lelns or through being a citizcii of the countries in
question. Since ne cannot classify ourselves in either cate-

'g'or\' it follow that we will not have even a llear-con‘iplete
understanding ol the situation.

So the conference provides us with an opportunityln
e‘s‘pose ourselves to the men referred to above: those With
a vocational interest or those with a nationalistic interest.

All of this is \vlitteu on the - sumption that Grinllell

dents, or lnore properly, American students, consider all.

tl'lJi'eciation of the crises of the world a challenge to them
as lnle lnals and as Americans ~

If this challenge is ignored by the young adults of the
nest democratic nation in the world today, i is a valid indi-
cation that the United States has reached its peak as a
:7 norld power and is now on the same decline tllat ancient
blue and, more recently, Spain traversed.

This cannot, must not be the case. For, if so, it would
nteaii the death of democracy and democratic nations. If we
do not accept the Challenge put to us we cannot expect na-
tions—wavering- between democracy and alltocracy to develop

if, the democratic way.

We must realize that these countri s are ilot hovering
between democracy and autocracy because of an intrinsic de-
feat, bllt because these countries and their people are being
36 .‘talltly influenced by the two most powerful nations in
if e world, the United States and Russia, and their conflict-
ing- theories of government,

We must encourage these nations to develop democrat-
ically, not because they will tip the balance of power our
nay, but because ne believe in democracy not only for oult
selves, but for all peoplesi

The staff of the Scarlet and Black would like to thank
the Student Council for its generous response to our request
‘ILIV funds to send this copy of the paper to various colleges
and institutions overseas. Beyond expressing our thanks as
an organization, we suggest that such uses as supplement-
ing the funds of campus organizations are an area of ac
’ ity illto nhich Council has but rarely ventured and which
might well be rewarding to the campus as a whole as many
\V'Ol'tllrwlllle activities are often deserted or, at best, abbre-
viated, for want of funds.
