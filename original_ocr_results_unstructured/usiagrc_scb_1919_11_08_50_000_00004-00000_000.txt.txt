Scienliﬁt llllnsl Stands ﬂn
Guard In Blair Hall 0’ Night

The peculiar light seen at night in
the east end or Blair hall is not a’
ghost, but issiinpiy the .light troni
an innocent incubator. Although- it
has caused more than one lair young
resident of the Quad a serious fright
it is merely fulﬁlling its duty to
science. This incubator. in which the
Botany Department keeps haeteriae,
is kept at a constant temperature. The
necessary heat is supplied by a series
of electric light bulbs which are turns
ed off and on automatically by a ther-
mostat as the heat varies. It is this
dashing on and bit of the iamps that
causes the ghostly light.
