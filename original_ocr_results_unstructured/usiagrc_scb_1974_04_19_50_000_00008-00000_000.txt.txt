Crushéd

by John Lom

The Great Grinnell Steamroller
is dead! The once powerful Grin-
nell Tennis team ran into an ener
gy shortage this past Friday and
Saturday and was dealt with back
to back crushing defeats. The Pi—
oneers suffered identical 1-8, 1—8
setbacks against two teams that
are highly talented: Ripon and La»
wrence.

Though the two Wisconsin schools
were favored in these matches, it
was considered that Grinnell would
make the contests more competit-
ive and dillicult. Not detracting
from the Caliber of their opponents,
it seemed apparent by the Pion-
eers’ play ',tllat they lacked ample
concentration, a definite require~
merit for competitive tennis.

Although the Pioneerswere cream-
ed, there were still some-bright
spots that came out of this weekend’s
disasters. One is thatFreshmanDan
Edwards remained undefeated for
the year by winning both at his
number six singles matches.

Another, and more significant res

‘ sult of the season’s first two los-
es was the creation oi a new ccms
mittment by all the members of the
team; to stop“pussy-loot’in ar—
oun " and start pla ing real tennis.
What this essential y means is that
all players will concentrate more
during pracﬁms in order to achieve
their lull potential as tennisplayers
during the upcoming Conierence Ma-

'.tches.

What has been learned from this
week’s loses is that the Pioneers
now know how it feels to lose ,_
lose badly! What they will try to
accomplish is to prevent the recur~
rence of such a disaster on their
long and difficult quest to achieve
Tennis perfection.

Grinnell was treated to the ﬁnest
local exhibition of track talent of
the year Saturday at the annual
Grinncll invitational Outdoor Track
Meet. Coming out on top of the 11'
team field was a very deep Luther
squad with in points. Trailing the

Hawk 33, Central 31, William Penn
24,1/2, and Grinnell and Knox with
14 apiece. Cornell, Dubuque, warl—
burg, and Monmouth provided the
dead wood for the meet.

Grinnell’s lop' performer was dis
tance jumper Dave Wright. The
veteran performer from Northtield,
Mn., was the Pioneers’ only double
placer, nabbing a second in the
long jump with a leap of 21’3"
and a third in the triple with a
43'4".

Chip Hall, Midwest Conference ch—
amp 3 year ago at throwing the jav-
elin, looked strong as he threw the
javelin 183's" and placed third in
the strong field.

or the 10 running events scheduled
for the invitational, Grinnell failed
to place in the first eight. Distance
stalwart Dave Raub broke the string
of goose eggs with a 14:53.0 effort
in the three mile run, ‘good for
third place. Tom Howland and Russ
Damtoft also ran impressively in
the three mile.

A fifth in the mile relay, the last
event of the day, rounded out. the
Grinnell scoring. Running a quarter
mile apiece in the, event were Da-
vid Jenney, Lincoln Marshall, Mark
Blanchard, and Jim Briles.

The Pioneers resume the outdoor
season with a triangular meet to-

nell‘s telilis womcn 'mesday. Ne—
ither could the Grinnell women kn.
ock off either of the other schools,
as the matches ended in 2—2 and
1—1 ties, respectively.

Qll‘y six .Grinnellians made th
trip, since Drake had only limi
ed number of cards. The star of
the show for the Pioneers was
freshman Catherine Lee. Playing
nlll-nlier two singles, Lea mapped
up her Graceland counterpart .1,
6—3, and her Drake opponent 674,
2-3. Her victories balanced num..
ber me singles player Michelle
Rothenberg‘s two losses. .

ln doubles -: npstition the Pio.
nocrs again earned a spill. Against

Graceland the win was provided
by upper classmlgn Ellen Yacknin
and Robin Recent. Despite being
pressed lor timn and eventually
being forced to quit early, the duo
cam/a ip with a 7—5, 3—2 decision,
insuring Grinnell of at least a tie
for the a‘ternoon. The Pioneers
lost a chance for a win when the
second doubles team, a team con-
sisting ornallen Grady and Karen

r, dropped a heartbrealfer in
three sets, 5—7, 6.4, 4-6.

Due to the shortage of time did
courts no double compz tion was
played out in the Grinnell-Drake
