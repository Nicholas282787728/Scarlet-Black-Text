WHAT STUDENTS WANT

Last spring there was some discussion by tlle
faculty of open library stocks. The faculty had
discussed the possibility of rceopcning them, and
a suitable method of caring for the checking out
of tlle boo In addition Lantern, representative
men's organlzhtion, and The Scarlet and Black
gave opinions in farm of open stacks through the
mediums of resolutions and editorials

Inquily this fall disclosed that the faculty had
dropped the matter, and as far its library ofﬁcials
knew were not considering opening the stacks to
students this year. The chief reason given was
that no adequate method could be arranged. Must
this condition continue through out the entire year
without remedy? Library officials and; other mclnr
bers of the faculty must realize that gcncrzll stu-
dent opinion is against closed stocks. ‘

Students would much rather, when they fire
looking for reference material on some subject, go
to the shelf where those books are kopt, look
through the index, and perhaps glance at a page
or two ill selecting their books, than resort to the
card index which merely lists the name of the
book and its author with the ﬁlo number.

Few students know the vltst Supply of books
in thc Grillncll collcgc library. If they were allow-
ed to wander among the stacks they would un-
dollbtedly again and again lldppcn onto some hook
in which they were into ted and which otherwise
would not fall into tho lulntls.

CHURCH HOMES HELPFUL

A feeling of relief caused by tllc emancipation
from church attendance and support may be felt
by men and women as they collie to collcgc for
the ﬁrst time, That is regrettable, however. from
viewpoints of both the home church and its fellow
church in Grinncll.

When church responsibility has been great in
a homc church, the fooling of relief may be so
pronounced that a student may be prone to lot
interest in any church lapse. Tllilt individual will
eventually regret the lack of stimulating CO-OpGl‘ﬂr
tion, The feeling of satisfaction derived from givr
ing service will be lni sing, also. Whothcr the re»
sponsiblllty has been in teaching a Sunday School
class, singing in a choir, or in rcguldr attendance
at worship, total r sation from such habits makes
a gap ill his weekly program that no other activity
can ﬁll

Gtinncll churches have c\tcndcd an imitation
to all stutlcnts lo , membership. Many
hmc ansuorcd this ill itutiou. To those who hole
not yet availed themselves of it, the opportunity
is still open.

THE MAN FROM MARS

Inhcl-cnt ill the totality of acquired habits
of thinking is it profound fcilr and distrust of
opcn-lnindcdncss. There is ihc four that lllhitlil-
tors, presumably opcnmindcd, will not sense the
reality of thc prejudices and interests of each fuc-
tion in conflict and that us :1 r lllt toncc in s
will be made to the cue Thus pooplo, indi-
vidually or colloctivcly, sclcloln attempt to solve
a problem by arbitration ol lom'clcllcc llefol'c Ii t
attempting to solve it by more primitive meal -.
Nations have always attempted to solve their cons
flicts ﬁrst by war and only nftcr ccononlic cxhzlust-
ion have they proposcd that their problems be
solved by arbitration.

It would be interesting to know what a man
from Mars, assuming that men live there, would
say to this world of ill-nunncuts, viewing the sillin-
tion with on opcll mind as he presumably collld,
being unacquilinlcd with conflicts and hotrcds of
the world. He would note the amount of money dc~
voted to wztrs in notions dcsiring pcttcc.

Could he collupl-chcnd‘ tllc irony of ll situation
in whicll people talk and writc sincerely of peace
yct continue to build armaments? Could he under-

stand the concept of “national defense” in a
world in which aggl-cssivc warfrtrc has been out
lnwc jollld he be so paciﬁstic, and hence, in-
liol idol-ale, us to ask why u peace-loving notion
denied citizruship to a peace loving man? Could
he even see the need of patriotism at all in its
traditional sense?

’I‘ht‘, theory of national defense under which
pretense notions maintain and build ztrmdmcnts is
historically absurd in the promotion of peaceful
relations. If armies and novics scttlc intcl-nlltionlll
conflicts by peaceful methods, those inclined to
be curious will wonder what could happen if not
ions should discover some morning tliztt all the
tools of witr had been destroyed during the night.
Undoubtedly there would be a bloody catastrophe
before unions could replace the destroyed guns
and lulllli ons.

The world must ho thankful that it is not to
be cursed with such on ulldusirdblc, dangerous
cl-olltllre us on opclldliindcd man from Mars to
pass judgment on al-lnmllullts.

DESERVING OF TRIAL

Pol-hops Grilnicllions who resent the now pl’ﬂl‘:
ticc ol' abolishing grades excepting the three, satis-
factory. poor, and failing, will view tho idea with
better grace when they realize that thc University
of Chicago has also done owzly with the scramble

”A’ ” The approach of the university is a
(rifle diffcront, however, for instead of not giving

’5,” it tries to encourage education I‘lliliel] tllull
credits. Slilco credits llrc no longer campus cur-

, the incentive is to get us much as possible

blue from tllc courses of study rather than
credits.

Treating college students as adults, the uni-
versity requires no assigned reading, but leaves
the matter of studying to the student. Certain
lists are recommended however. and no doubt are
followed by a majo y of students.

America is getting away from the accusation
that she turns out college graduates in “mass pro-
duction.” Gl'illncll’s offering of the three grade
system should be given it ,dt'iillitc trial before bring

FARM CORPORATIONS

There has been no dearth in suggestions of.-
l‘crcd within tllc last 18 \nlnntlls for solution oi‘
the form situation. Several southern legislatures
have attempted to do away with ollr cotton slu-
pills by annihilation of llc.\t spring s planting. It.
is supposed, ol' coul-,sc that the plmllels—cx on the
poor ones u h only ,10 holes of glouudillould
manage to e st somehow Govclnol an Tulncl
believes that if Iowa cull withhold its corn crop
long enough, the price will become 60 cents c
bushel Another would have our currency inflated.
thus rinsing general form priccs, although he has
not asked the wugccarners as to their opinion of
the plan.

Other proposals include a lowering of farm
mortgage interest rates, abandonment of federal
irrigation dams and the farms dependent on them
as it means of decreasing the form acreage, and
production of crops by contract. A recent bulletin
has proclaimed new uses for cotton.

I’l'hr’lt is undoubtedly needed is a recognition
of the fuel, that the form Situation is an inter
national one, and while farmers in our wheitt belt
would greatly benefit by .8, reduction in interest
rates, yet so long as there is u large surplus of
wheat ill this country because Russia has taken
away our European markets, there cannot be much
rural prosperity.

So for the corporation farm has been treated
with open hostility by those wllo are afraid that
the farmcr would lose his independence by its in»
tl-oductioll. Others have met with the idea with
mild curiosity. \Vhy lake It narrow vicw‘Z Ill Kltu-

MORE FREEDOM FOR SORORITIES
(From the Daily Trojan)

Another feminist step forward since the days when
philosophers of the Middle Ages debated whether or
not women possessed souls has just been taken on the
Berkeley campus. With rare understanding of the clifs
ference between the modern collegiate world and the
day when the administrators attended school, officials
of California have ruled that. campus women do not
have to return to their rooms until 2:15 after dates dur-
ing the weekend.

Another ruling of importance, especially to the
men, is that sorority house callcls do not have to be
ushered, politely but firmly, out of the door at. 12
o’clock, but may stay on the sofa or porch swing until
2:15.

This upsto-datc policy, consistent with ideas on the
ability of the modern girl to take care of herself, could
well he adopted by other leading universities.

MUSIC WILL HAVE CHARM
(From the Daily Trojan)

Discontinuance of the devotional exercises and short
lectures which have characterized the chapel period at
this university for many years marks the inauguration
of a new type of program for the benefit of Trojan Stu»
dents.

Caused by the absence of Dr. Bruce Baxter, who
for years has led the services during chapel period, an
organ concert will be played daily in place of tbe de-
votional services.

Whether this innovation is to be termed a substi-
tute or an advance toward greater individualism in re-
ligion is besido the point. But Trojan students will be
given the opportunity to hear lighter classical and semi»
classical musical compositions, ably rendered by a fel—
low student. The informality of the programs, tos
gather with the variety of selections from the best c0m~
posers, should help to make the concerts popular. Ten
minutes relaxation under the spell of soothing organ
music will provide more spiritual inspiration than many
hd1f~hour lectures.

Sophomore Back Declared
Ineligible

(Special to The Scarlet and Block)

OMAHAicrcighton grid hopc's
received an unexpected blow today
when university nuthorities announcA
ed that Jack Garland, sophomore
backfield find, had been declared in»
eligible.

Garland, who was just beginning
his first your of varsity competition,
had already established himself as
one of thc harrlest»hitt.ing backs on
the squad, and his absence will mean
the loss of speed and power to the
Bluejay backfield.

Inserted into the game against
Baker university last Saturday, the
sophomore speedster contributed the
longest run of the game when he
dodged 56 yards through Kansas
tnchlers, only In be hauled down a
few feet from the goal.

At the same time, Conch Arthur
Stark announced several changes in
his regular lineup. Roy Almgren.
loo-pound fullback from Manhattan,
Kans, has been shifted to right half-
bnclr, and Captain Bin Worthing,
versatile Jny field general, will hold
down a fullback post. ,
