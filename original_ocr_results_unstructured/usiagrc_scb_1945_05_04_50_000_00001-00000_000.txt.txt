Grinnell Rules

Discover Rules Are No+
Loved and Not Disliked

The Public Opinion and Morale‘
class. taught by Dr. George D.
Lovell, recently completed an ab‘
titudes survey on the subject of.
rules at Grinnell, This survey
was prompted by a similar one
taken in 1942,

Conducted in the manner of the
National Public Opinion Organi-
zation, the ﬁftyrseven students

who were quizzed were divided
proportionately as to classes and
cottages.

The results indicate that thisl
cross section of the college pop-l
ulation is neither strongly oppos-
ed to nor strongly in favor of‘
the existing college rules. Most
.of the answers showed that while

the students‘ are not overly an-
xious for a lot of rules, diey
recognize the necessity for rules.
and think the existing ones are
not so bad.

This is almost exactly the same
attitude as shown in the April,
1942 survey. In 1942 the fresh
man class was most in favor of
rules, the sophomore class was
most opposed, and the seniors
and juniors ranged themselves in
ibetween.

The current survey expresses
almost no difference in the at-
Litudcs of the various classes,
Using an eleven-point scale. in
which an eleven would indicate
jthc most extreme distaste for
‘icollege Tules, and a one would
lindicate the most favorable opin-
ion, the average of this survey
was a neutral six.

It should be understood that
this whole survey is purely a
-class exercise.

 

 

.Survey by RaceéiRelation Class
Reveals Unconscious Prejudices

let these gave as their reason that
they felt Negro students would

A survey of one hundred
Grinnell co—eds orb the sub—
ject of prejudice against
Negroes has been conducted
by Ruth Wagner and Malt
jol‘ie Alcol'll as a project for
the race relations class under
Dr. John Burma.

This survey reveals many ideas
and attitudes held by the average
college girl of a general Inldr
western area which are well
uorth considering and evaluat-
ing. The questionnaire indicated
that one—half of the students had
attended high schools with Nev
groes and three-fourths of the
students had talked with Negroes
as long as five minutes at a
time. This gives a certain amount
of validity to the survey, since
at least seventyefive per ccnt of
the students quizzed on the subr
ject have had sonic contact with
Negroes.

Few Admit Prejudice

Asked a pelnLrblSnk question,
thirty per cent of the girls ad-
niitted havmg racc prcjudice.
while seventy per cent denied it.
Twentyrfour per cent of the stu-
dents were not Willing to have
Negro students admitted to Grin-
ncil coilcge, but five per cent

not be happy here, Twenty per
cent of the girls indicated that
tiiey would not be willing to sit
next to a Negro student in class.

A seemingly direct contradic—
tion of attitudes arises from the
tabulations which show that half
of the students quizzed would not

administered. yet only thirty per
cent of the students admitted
having race prejudice. A careful
study of the individual quastwn-
naire also reveals that some of
those sludcms who at first pro-
fessed to have no prejudice. lat»
or on said they would not sit
next to a Negro in class. This
-soiinds like harsh judgement, but
a just conclusion might be that
more people have prejudices than
realize it or would ever admit.
(hire is Essential

An interesting harangue could
be delivered concerning the her
cessity of acknowledging a prob-
lem bctorc a cure can be silent
ed. That a cure is rcgordcd as
essential is proved by the fact
that three-fourths of the girls
taking part in this survey hcliev-
ed that thc Negroes should have
a representative at any interline

 

like to have Negro blood plasma-

tional peace conference.

Ninety per cent of the surveyedi
students felt that there would
hit: little or no change in the Neel
gl‘o'S status after thc war, but.
the ten per cent that expected
a change were among the fifty
per cent that had studied race
problems at some time.

Askcd about tiic soiircc of their
prejudice, most of the students
stated that they have been in-
fluenced by public opinion rather-
then by personal experience.
Ninety-five per cent of the stu-
dents would cmpioy Negroes in
their homes. From this, the con-
cliision can be drawn diet it is
not the Negro himself that lsl
rescntcd, but rather the Negro‘
“out of his place," This might
almost indicatc a social as well
as a racial prejudice.

According to Dr, John Burma,
under whose dircction this survey
was conducted, thesc rcsiiits are
typical for this section of thc
coiuitry. However, a clear think-
er should find in this survey a
challenge to broadrmlndedncss
and tolerance Surely a problem
which will occupy such an Im—
portant position in post-war Cone
ditions is deserving of fair and
far-sighted Consideration,
