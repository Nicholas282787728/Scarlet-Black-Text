Do You Want To

$50.00 a. Week This Summer

The largest manufacturer of its kind in the world—«nationally known
and respected through its product :and through its advertising appearing in
the Saturday Evening Post and other leading national magazines-«offers

men of this college an opportunity to make $50 I week or more during

summer vacation.

For several years we have received many applications from co‘llge .men who have

wanted to represent us'during the summer. :3.“ w __ .. _ _

Although We are the largest institution of our kind in the world, we have never,
until just recently, been in position to take advantage of these applications from college
men who have seen the money-making advantagesof working for us during the summer.

Now that We have increased our already tremendous production we can, for the
ﬁrst tice in our history, consider expanding our organization this summer by adding a
limited number of college men who want tolmake a good income during the vacation
period.

These men will also have the opportunit yof representing us at the college next fall
and the income-from their efforts during spare hours should go far towards paying their
expnses during the term.

Our organization is an international institution. We have over 200 branch ofﬁces
in the United States andICanada.

Our product is well and favorably known. It needs no introductory work to sell it.
Each sale puts a substantial proﬁtinto the pocket of our representative. Sales, which
make an income. to our men of $50 a week, are more common than'unusual.

Selling our product is clean work—wholesome and pleasant. it has nothing to do
with books, insurance, magazines, brushes or anything which might be distasteful to you.

If you want a $50 a week income thisrsummer, under pleasant conditions and sur- ,
roundings, see our District Sales Manager while he is in Grinnell.
