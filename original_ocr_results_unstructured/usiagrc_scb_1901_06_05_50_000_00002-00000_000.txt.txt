HE Hill prizes torextempo-
raneous work was estab-
lished in 1891 by Dr. Gershom l'I.
Hill and Rev. James L. l-llll, both
of the class of ’71. Now on the
tenth anniversary of their foundr
ing comes the welcome news that
the prizes are to bc doubled by
these two loyal lriends of the
college. This generous action
,will be highly appreciated by the
students’and on their behalflve
wish to make acknowledgement
ot our gratitude.

HE statementfrom the mane
agernent otthe Unit, which
appears in another column, altho'
a strong one, is heartily endorsed
by the management of ScAllez'l‘
AND BLACK. Of the four hundred
and iorty students in college,
abouta hundred are subscribers
to this paper. At least severity-
ﬁve of thcse are still unpaid.
. T is not our purpose to urge
students to use the summer
vacation as a time [or study. Tire
summer months can be used to
better advantage. But it seems
advisable at this time to afford
suggestion to those contemplating
certain special lines ot work next
year. The preliminary debaters
have been chosen, and a question
will be selected-which will be care
fully studied during the summer,
so that when the (all tel-m begins,
our debaters will have their sube
jeet pretty well in httnd. The wise
dom of‘this plim is recognized by
all, The stlmc Condition which
confronts the debaters, confronts

-— possible to prepare an oration or

the right quality, It you wait until
school opens in the tall, and at
tempt to work it up in cotuunetion
with your school work. The
prospects for a chair at oratory in
lorra College are brighter now
than they have been [or a good
while. The students are interest-
ed and the Faculty are interested.
but the only way to make this
longeehfor result a reality is to
make the orntottcal contest one of
greater inter-est by producing ora-
ttons of a distinctly higher grade.

Freshman Program.

The last program ot Grinncll
Institute [or this term was rcndct-
ed in the society hall last evening
by the members ot the Freshman
class. Tire program was opened
by chry James, who gave one of
Pies. Lincoln's addresses. Mr.
Crilcy iollowcd with a humorous
reading which called forth a great
deal of laughter, The next num»
her was a vocal solo by Mr, Cone
dit, who kindly responded to a
hearty encore. The program was
closed with_a debate upon the
question, “Resolved, That the
Southern Negroes Should be Der
prived ot the Right oi sunrage."
Mr. James Howell set forth in a
forccable manner tllctcdsons why
the negro should not be allowed
to vote.

This was Mr. Howell's ﬁrst ap-
pearance betore the society and
his work was VCIy creditable. Mr.
Henry Weber argued against the
proposition that thc negro should
be deprived or .uilrage and
strengthened his assertions with
good authorities. l’res. hlncatb
ney summed up the debate and
dccidcd in favor of the negative.

This closes a very successful
year's work fol thnnell Institute.
