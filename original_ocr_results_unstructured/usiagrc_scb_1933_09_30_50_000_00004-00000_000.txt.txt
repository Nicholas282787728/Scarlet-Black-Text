THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Students Consider ,
Pioneer Prudities

(Continued from page 1)

Last semester agitation for the
Pioneer Prudities was begun by the-
Sigrna Delta Chi chapter in Februr
ary. An unofficial poll of men re-
vealed a favorable consensus, but co—
eds expressed the opinion that the
time was too short to consider the
production last spirng.

“Intrmuumls No Conﬂict"

One difficulty mentioned this year
is that the womens dance intramur-
als would duplicate dance work in
the revue. Frances Collins, president
of the Women's Athletic association,
present at Thursdays meeting, de~
clared her belief that this difficulty
might he ironed out by giving wo<
men credit for dance work in the
Frudities.

The theory was also advanced that
the Pruditles and women’s dance in-
tramurals might be given alternately
on successive years.

Miss Collins Friday evening de<
clared that she was highly in favor of
the Prudities,

The Pruditles when presented at
Grinnell formed a competitive event
for hall and cottage residents. One
hall and one cottage combined to
write and produce a shit, and prizes
were given for the best efforts.

Author Committee Considered

One attempt to revive the produc—
tion two years ago ended in failure
because of the quality of skits was
seated for consideration.

The plan has been advanced this
year that the sponsors, Sigma Delta
Chi and National Collegiate Players.
might appoint a committee to draw
up a general plan of the revue and
six scenarios, hall and cottage com-
petition being limited to production.

Results of the all-college poll in
regard to sentiment concerning the
production will he announced in the

 

Wednesday issue of The Scarlet and
Black.

Coed Chorus
Holds Tryouts

Glee Club Members Choose

Eleven New Singers

Finalists in the tryouts for the
Women's Glee club were heard for
the last time Thursday. After the
elimination contest which followed,
11 women were asked to become
members of the club.

Jean B'rodt was elected to fill the
vacancy as alternate in the second
contralto section. Regular second so
prance chosen were Rita. Phelps, Elsa
Carlen and Carrie Monger, with
Thelma, Huber as alternate.

Rosalyn Hough will he a regular
in the first Contralto section, while
Maxine Kale will be the alternate.
The three new first soprano regu-
lars are Joyce Palmer. Marjorie Hal-
man and Elizabeth Shoulhei’g, with
Esther Mccollough as alternate.

Forty-five women were heard dur-
ing‘ the course of the eliminations,
and competition was unusually
strong, As there were only 11 va-
cancies to he filled there were neces.
sarily many women displaced. This
means that there should he a good
delegation ready to tryout for next
year's club, for those eliminated in
the finals for this year will auto.
matically he eligible for seconds next
year.

Congratulations to. the new mem—
bers were extended by the last year’s
group Firday evening at a dinner at
the quadrangle.

The honor system has been extend»
ed at the University of North Caro-
lina (Greensboro, N. C,), according
to a recent announcement. Under the
new plan, each classroom group
elects a committee which has full
jurisdiction over breaches of honor,
suspension of students for violation
of the code, and the reporting of Stu»

another when a recent change made
such a job necessary.
