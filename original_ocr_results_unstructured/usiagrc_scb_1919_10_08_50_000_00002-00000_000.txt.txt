WHEN YOU’RE AN OLD Gilli“).

When the ”old grads" get together
back here at Commencement time,
what do they talk about? Do they dis

Not on your life. They tall: about the
time they tied the cow in the chapel
or swiped the pulpit or the time they
beat Minnesota in football and other-
kindred subjecmi

When We get old and dccrepih and
see some of the old gang we expect to
talk about the time we beat lowa and
had a big special train to iowa City
and about the year before when our
Special had a hot box and also about
the various “Gl'lnnell Specials" to
Drake, and so forth.

What will you talk about ﬁfty years
from no’w at your class reunion? Will
it be about the Ames Special and the
good time you had at Ames or will it
be about the good time you didn't
ha‘vo because you stayed home? The
cost will be negligible compared with
the returns. You will see a wonder

and, most or all. you will see real
school spirit, the real Grinncll spirit
