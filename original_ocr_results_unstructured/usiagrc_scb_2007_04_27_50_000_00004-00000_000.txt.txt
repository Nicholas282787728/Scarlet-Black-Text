History to offer new classes with newer profs

/With only a few returning faculty, students will have difficulty choosing classes based on profes-
sors, and Meats will have many new faces

As students begin 51th
mitting their pie-registration
forms for next semester, those
looking for History classes
may find tlic course selec-
tion a little more limited than
in pievioiis years. According
to Dean of the College Jim
Swartz, the
department
will have
only one re-
turning fulls
time faculty
member next
year.

Because
of this, the
department cannot yet final—
ize its course offerings for
the fall which has concerned
some students,

“I think a lot of history
majors are upset," said His—
tory major and memberofthc
History SEPC Molly Blake
’08. “I think the big problem
is that many students, int
eluding niyselr, pick courses
based on the professor, so not
knowing the professor makes
it difficult."

The department is cur-
reiitly looking to hire both
tempomiy and tenurertrack
replacements. Each protes-
sor has a spec lty, therefore

to accept research awards.
“It’s kind ofwe just had a lot
or good fortune in research
awards, but the timing ofit all
was a little awkward."

Purcell, who will be on
leave to complete research
next year, does not expect
there to be ﬁnalized course
offering for students until fi-
nals week at the earliest.

“They do have an expe-
dited process [for hiring temr

porary pintessuisl,“ she said.
“But we still have to have
time to bring the candidates
to canipiis and we had to have
an open month to field applir
cations so that we could get a

Purcell, Swim: and ties

Brown, Historv, all «glee that
although the changes to the
department bring unfortu-

they also prompt diversity in
the course selection.

“It’s difficult at the end
of the semester to have three
candid es on campus at one
riine,"siid Pui‘ccll.“VVc’rc go-
ing as last as we know that we
can."

According to Blake, most
History majors welcome the
diversity and can complete
their majors on time with the
changes that will be made to
the course offerings next year,
but many nie still worried
about taking a class with a
professor who does not have
an established reputation on
the Grinnell campus.

But Purcell said she was

ulty would be well qualiﬁed.
“That's one reason it’s sort of
taking a while is we’re trying
to pet the best quality people
we can, she said “The mat

Given the uncertainty
siiirounding the department,
facility members have tried to
keep students updated about
recent developments. In a
memo sent to ottecanipiis

RLCs M _
airs.
from p‘ 1 While the ultimate decir
sion falls to college administrators, the school
tries to involve students as much as possible.
All Grinnell students, whether they hold
a student staff position or not, are eligible to
participate in the process and give their irr
ut.
P Brad Menard, current Smounker RLC,
and Sheree Andrews,Assistant Dean and Di—
rector of Residence Life, both agree that the
students are the most important deciding fact
tor on candidates.

Brad Menard said the college should

maintain a strong focus on students when
considering potential RLCs because students
are the most important part of an RLCsjob.

He said that when he applied, his favorite
part of the hiring process was “meeting the
students because that’s who you’re really got
ing to be working with.”

The students also happened to be one of
the biggest selling points for him, particularly
when deciding between Grinnell and other
schools with similar positions.

“we need to make sure [to] rind people
who do genuinely like students, who are open
to the selfrgovernance," Andrews said. “This

firmly/i“

isn't one of those Colleges where you’re writ-
ten up for every little thing and people are
watching your every move. And RLCs should
be conscious ofthat,”

To better improve the selection process
and provide candidates with a sense oflife at
Grinnell, Brad Menard, with the support of
several stairmembers, is also trying to include
overnight stays by candidates as a part ofthe
interview process.

Prospective RLCs, much like prospective
students, would stay overnight with a current
RLC and shadow them as they fulfill the dair
1y duties ofthejob,

According to Brumer,Titrany Menard is
a perfect example of the benefit of awareness
of the campus. After having spent a year on
campus developing an awareness of students
and the nuances of Grinnell campus life,Tif-
(any decided to apply for an RLC position
herself.

Brumer thought that Tiffany Meanrd’s
familiarity with the school made her a more
attractive candidate.

“One thing I find important," he said “is
selecting an RLC who is experieneed with
small schools and familiar with schools that
have a personality like Grinnell’s.”
