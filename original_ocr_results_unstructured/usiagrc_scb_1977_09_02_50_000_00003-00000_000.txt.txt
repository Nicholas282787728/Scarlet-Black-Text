Pfitsch said Grinnell will retain
the 4724 setrup used last year in
which two “strikers” replace the
conventional forwards. One striker
plays behind the other and sets the
ball up, much as a center halfback
conventionally would.

Theteam’s firstgame is at Beloit
on September 9, followed by
another road game at Wisconsin
State in Plattesville the next day.
Asked if he thought last year‘s 4—3-1
record could be improved upon,
Pfitsch replied, “I’m’ always op-
timistic, but i’m not sure.” He then
cited that this year’s tougher
schedule, which includes St. Olaf
and Carleton, has to be taken into
consideration, He concluded, ”It
also depends a lot on the attitude

 

that develops here."

The Grinncll College football
team openedits 1977 practices with
47 enthusiastic players competing
for the starting positions. The
Pioneers will be trying to improve
on last year's 3-5 record.

Head Coach Edd Bowers seems
optimistic in appraising his squad.
The nucleus of the team consists of
the four captains; Paul Crane, Bob
Grant, Paul Matecki and Mark
Bowman. However. the coach will
also rely on ireshmen to make a
significant contribution.

Coach Bowers sees Cornell as the
team to beat in‘ the Midwest
Conference, The Rams have most
of their players returning from last
year’s championship Squad.
Cornell will be given plenty of
competition by the traditional
powerhouses of Coe and Mon-
mouth. Knox, who tied Cornell for
the ’76 Championship, will un-
doubtably be another prime

contender.
The Pioneers seem to be plagued

by three factors, their lack oi size,
their lack of depth and the
replacement of last year’s all
conference end, Paul Delaney, who
has graduated. However, the
squad could be very tough it they
can remain injury free, and can
find suitable receivers for Senior
QB Paul Crane, who looks imr
pressive in preseason practice

The Pioneers open their season
away at lowa Wesleyan on Sep»
temner 17. They return home to
i‘ ace Beloit on September 24. With a
few good breaks, this could be the
year of the Pioneers.

The new attack system consists
of a [ourrman forward line. The
players for these positions are
senior Jill Kreske, junior Minje
Martinez, sophomore Laurie
Cragg and freshman Harriet
Phinney. Although only a fresh
man, Phinney‘s speed and four
years of high school experience
should prove her a viable con-
tender.

The two quick “link" positions
appear to be tilled by two highly
skilled returnees, sophomores
Cathy Gillis and Kim Krutiila.

Returning halfbacks consist or

Winkler concluded by comr

menting, “With numerous
returnees I am optimistic, as i see
it, we should be contenders in
every game despite an ambitous
schedule including Carleton and
University of Minnesota."

The team begins its ten game
