Not all oi his disagreements with
Bratistad's policies deal with local issues.

Branstad's decision to dispatch towa nav
tional guardsmen to Honduras. He has also

in favor of the Death Penalty for certain
cases. Branstad said. “I do not favor the
Death Penalty for all life sentence cases

obtain convictions" '

Yet, Branstad said that he only favored
the death penalty tor cases where a person
was Convicted of a sexual assault or kid-
napping - and then was convicted of
murdering the person he had kidnapped
or sexually assaulted.

Branstad also added to his remarks mat
he intended to declare portions oi Jasper
