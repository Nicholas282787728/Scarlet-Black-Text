Dear Dave.

‘ I have an idea that should make eating
here suck less:

In most major cities. the local sports
arena has banners hanging from the
rafters with the numbers of notable
players on that city’s team. The idea is to
honor the outstanding player by “retiring"
‘their number and displaying it in the home

. .town area.

Boston. [or example. has dozens of ban-
ners honoring championship teams as well
as Bruin and Celtic luminaries hanging
‘l‘roi’n the rafters of Boston Garden, ()ur
own Darby Gymnasium has the retired
'numbers oi legendary ci-innell sports
figures draped from its raiters. too.

i was thinking, Dave. that maybe we
could retire the ID numbers oi outstanding
Grinnell Students and drape them (rain the
'hanners in the Cowles and Quad dining
.halls.

“Oh sure.“ you’re probably thinking.
i“this is the same sort of outlandish idea
that iorced Floyd Beaver into an early
‘retirement."

‘ 0n the contrary. mon directeur du

to preserve college history and add a touch

We could form a committee to determine

Most importantly, Dave. Grinnellians

Those graduates who go on to iniluence

Now I know what the best part about be

the notice of the latest tuition increase out

and carelessly tossing the note into the

On a related note did you see where the

something needed to be done to break the

impasse. The Contadora nations continued

January oi this year it was announced that
the Contadora nations would bring to the
isthmus a revised treaty; one. it was hoped
that it would appease all sides. granting
concessions to U.S. allies without sacriiic-
ing the support of Managua.
