Victim‘s reluctance leads to release of sus ects

 

Stolen bic

by Stephen Hardwick

With the help of the GrinA
neil Police Department, junior
Emmie Hershey recovered her
stolen mountain bike, worth
$500. Partly because of Her
shey's reluctance to work with
the authorities. however, the
police may have lost an op-
portunity to catch the man re-
sponsible for many of the bike
thefts on campus.

"My anger was geared at
somebody who seemed so far
away from the law at that point,"
Hershey said in explaining her
actions. "It was through the
people that got me the bike.
through the man who bought the
bike and then down to the person
who stole the bike. That's the
only person my anger was really
directed at. So it was very
confusing."

Hershey's unlocked bicycle
was stolen on the evening of Oct.
24 from the front of her off-cam»
pus college-owned house. Her-
shey put up signs around campus
offering a "large" reward for the
return of the bicycle. However,
she says the signs did not lead to
the return of her bicycle. "I did
some investigation. I heard some
rumors and looked into them .
The signs did not have anythi g
to do with it. It was after] talked
with a few people around town
that somebody called me."

A women called Hershey

 

the evening of Nov. 3. The
woman told Hershey that the man
who had bought the bicycle from
the thief wanted $250-$300 for
its return. Hershey asked the
woman to negotiate a lower
price. Later that evening. the
woman called back. She said that
Hershey would have to pay $300
or she would not get her bicycle
back.

The caller was not the
thief. She was only an
intermediary. The original thief
sold the bicycle to a second party.
Hershey's understanding was that
the second party paid for the
stolen property with cocaine.
Police Chief Dan Boyer doubts
that story claiming that the
bicycle was probably sold for
about $25.

Hershey agreed to meet the
intermediary at 11am, the
following morning to exchange
the $300 for the bicycle She had
hoped to get her bicycle without
paying the $300. "I had a little
concoction in my mind," said
Hershey. but her uncle persuaded
her that she should abandon the
idea

Hershey called the police at
the urging of her uncle and Dean
of Student Affairs Torn Crady.
She was concerned about her own
safety and the safety of her house
mates. "The meeting was
scheduled to be at my house and I

didn‘t like the idea of that;
neither did the rest of the people
in my house, . . , I didn't know
who I was dealing with. I didn't
know what this woman was go-

kind of troubles were going to be
involved, so I didn't feel like I
could just go out there and get

hands. Hershey agreed to the
plan.

Just before 11 am” Friday.
Nov. 4, a car pulled up to Her»
shey's house while three Grinneli
police officers watched. The
woman with whom Hershey had
talked on the phone and her hus-
band drove up to the house. The
couple took the stolen bicycle
out of the trunk and gave it to
Hershey. Hershey warned the
couple saying. "I've called the
police, if you want the money,
it's yours. If you want to just
walk away and let them do what
they want, that‘s fine with me."
They said. "Just give us the
money: we‘ll talk to the police."

The couple took the $300.
The moment the envelope
changed hands, the police ofﬁcers
swooped in and detained the cou—

ple for suspicion of extortion and
theft. Later that day, the police
released the couple.

"We had a very good case
against some people and because
the victim was reluctant to help
us, we lost it." said Chief Boyer.
He added. "The reason we couldn't
press charges . . . is that we
didn't have a good enough wit-
ness. She thanked them for
bringing the bike back and then
offered at a later date to pay them
for bringing it back." Boyer is
frustratcd because he feels that his
department lost a chance to stop a
major bicycle thief. He had
hoped to use the inIen-nediaries to
get to the thief.

The chief also claimed that
the couple could have kept the
money, but. "They were just so
happy to get out of here because
they knew they were bad." Boyer
decided to give the money back to
Hershey because he thought that
it would have been "way
overboard" to let the
intermediaries keep IL

Hershey understands
Boyer‘s frustration. She said "I
know I was very reluctant to
work with [the police]. From
their point of view, their com-
plaints against my actions are
completely valid.“ However, she
felt a moral obligation to keep
the intermediaries out of jail,
even though she acknowledges
that their actions were criminal,
She said "[thc police] tried to
convince me that [the intermodi»
aries] were breaking the law.

which I know they did, techni-
cally. legally . t t . They were
guilty of accessory to conspiracy
and extortion. That‘s guilt.
However, I don't know know if
their motivations were anything
but helping me get the bike
back."

Boyer said that he knew
Hershey‘s decision to involve the
police, but not press charges was
difficult for her. He questions,
however, the implications of her
actions.

"What‘s going to happen
the next time? What if this
young women‘s hike turns up
missing tomorrow and they call
her back the next night alld say,
'Anothcr $300 please?’ Is that
when she's going to say,
’Enough's enough.‘ or is she go-
ing to pay them off again?"

Hershey took exception to
the chief‘s remark. "I just
couldn't find it in myself to feel
angry that day. It was 'enough's
enough.‘ I feel that comment is
misdircclt'dr"

According to Boyer, there
is more at stake in this incident
than simply Hershey's bicycle.
He feels that he lost an opportu-
nity to show college students that
the police department cares about
them. "I‘m really not pleased
[with Hershey‘s actions] because
it was an opportunity for the po-
lice department to go to bat for
one of the college students . . .
and in tum help out all the s or
dents who are having property
stolen. especially bicycles."
