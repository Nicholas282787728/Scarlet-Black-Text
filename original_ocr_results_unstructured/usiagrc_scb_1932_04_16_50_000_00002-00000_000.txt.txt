sues over its alloted year.

In writing 30, whi h in newspaper parlance
puts an end to ally Story, there is no need for post
lnortems. it has been a great year with enough
battles to add spice. enough it in to llmlie the.
management rcalize its responsib s, and enough
praise to enjoy the opportunity,

The most satisfaction came from the establish-
ment of the central auditing- committee First advo-
cated by The Scarlet and Black and universally
backed by campus organizations,

The library suffered the brunt of Scarlet alld
Black attack during the last year, uujustl)I pelt

the pint of the newspaper, The stac s were opened
to student use evidently and the (1h ago Trillium
editorials were discontinued when mi representm
tion in other papers led to unjust er snl of the
college.

The Scarlet and Black st tll' opposed any
addition to compulsor tudent “pcnditure which
is included in its opposition to the proposal to put
the Cyclone on the semester fee, a measure which
was dropped by faculty veto,

Control by the new board should in no way alter
the independence of poliey on the part of the new
management. alld they should be able to carry on
with editorials for revision of the tent em to

ANOTHER OFFICE MISFILLED
(From the Ioun State Strident)

Reed Ha , expelled editor of the Columbia Specs
tator. lmderg adunte newspaper at Columbia university,
Columbia, N. Y., has stirred up a mess for himself and
his college.

The immediate cause of his dismissal was a charge
made by Harris that the university was exploiting stu—
dent waiters. Harris, termed a crusading editor by his
followers, also suggested student investigation of the
Kentucky coal mines, which ended in his dismissal.

Editors of newspapers in all parts of the United
states have editorialized pro and can on Hurris' dismis-
sell. The students of Columbia have participated in
demonstrations that will blacken the eye of Columbia
for a generation. The majority of college editors lamv
hast Columbia officials for suppressing student criticism
of college affairs, et eetera. '

It is granted that freedom of the press is one of the
prime necessities of a newspaper. But let it be said lib<
eralism may be as dangerous a weapon in the hands of
a hlnnderer as it is a constructive and valuable instru-
ment under the guidance of a clear thinker.

Reed Harris bungled his job. He was unskillful in
the manipulation of his editorial power.

Look at it from this angle. Suppose that all of the
editor's accusations were true. Suppose that he was en—
tirely justified in making all of the statements that he
did make. Why blare forth brazenly and tell the world
about the faults of the eollege of which he is a part?
would it not have been better for him to have exhibited
more finesse in the matter?

Could he not have gone to the officials of the college
with the proof of his accusation and said, “This and that
are at fault at this institution. Unless something is done
to correct them in the near future, I will expose them
in my editorial columns." '

What would the college officials have done in that
case? Likely they would have made immediate steps to
correct the universrty ailments. if there were any. If
they did not, then would be the time for Harris to ex
pose the situation.

Harris was crude, despite his campaigning spirit. .

Not "another editor dismissed,”7another office misfilled.

AN UNFAIR EX’PU'LSION
(From the Oberlin Review)
The latest example of suppression of freedom of the
press was shown last week when Reed Harris, editor of

the Columbia Spectator, was given his walking papers ‘

because of his editorial attacks on football as “organized
murder,”. and on the treatment of Waiters in the John
Jay dining hall. Unfortunately for Reed Harris, he was
no “yes" man: he showed no hesitation in delving into
mismanagement of the university. His aims were not
for personal glory, but for higher standards at Columhi

His active work as editor succeeded in making the Spec-
tutor one of the best in the country. and one that was

frequently quoted in many other eollege papers thruout ,

the nation.
A. quotation from a special article written by Harris
last January shows clearly his pul'pcs ~

"The Columbia Spectator, because it has been treat- ‘
ed with fairness and a true ‘handsmff’ policy b the unis ,

‘vcrsity administration, has been able to or most
violently where it has believed that such criticism has
been \vorrantediand it will continue to 'do so. In the
recent muchrpublicized football controversy which was
opened by Spectator changes in existing football con»
ditions were brought about at Columbia whereas nothr
mg could have been accomplished under a censored
system."

Little did Harris know what a mistake he had made
when he spoke of Columbia’s hands—off policy. His harsh
criticisms did not help the reputation of the school.
Expulsion was one way for the dean to put a stop to
them.

We join the scores of omer college editors who be-
moan Columbia's action. Few editors are as active and
competent as Reed Harris. The example made of him
is a discouragement to expression of honest opinion. If
the charges made in the editorials can not he answered.
the situations should be remedied. and the editor re-
instated.

WHAT YOU’RE UP AGAINST
(From the Louisiana State Reveille)
If you had asked us previously, we’d have said it

couldn’t be done, but after waiting a long time, we have '
at last heard a pacific argument in favor of military

training in American universities.

Someone has advanecd the theory that instead 0[
stimulating the war spirit, military training discourages
it by showing the subject what hc is up against. Military
training has probably been the th’eme of more editorials

in college papers than any other one subject, but this ,.

is a new slant at last. And there may be something to it.

Who can say? perhaps many of the things to which
ardent pacifists object so strongly really work both ways,
not only encouraging war spirit but occasionally dis—
couraging it.

Certainly, there is no stronger sermon than a good
moving picture. And sound has given added realism. To
our way of thinking, there are few stronger arguments
against war than the more thrilling and terrifying
seenes of such pietures as “All Quiet on the Western
Front.” and “Journey’s End.” Mere words could never
picture so vividly the phase 0[ war that is so easily for
gotten or disregarded by militarists and recruiting of—
ficers. ‘

In a similar way the theory is tenable that military
training in the university might discourage the amateur
soldier by showing him What he is up against, altho
the longest drill and the most spirited sham battle can-
not approaeh a resemblance to the rigors of war and the
roar of battle.

Thursday
G. o. Siever, professor of French,
spoke in chapel Thursday on the world
attitude toward France. “The world
is in a turmoil now,” he said. “and
we have to have someone to blame
for it. During the war it was Ger—
many. afterward the Bolshevists, and
now it is Franco.”
There is scarcely anything more
sacred to the French than the in—
tegrity of a legal contract, be ex»
plalncd. This partially explains their
insistence on strict adherence to
the Versailles treaty. He pointed to
the French fear of Germany as not
unreasonable.

Friday

The Friday chapel program was an
address by Willard M. Craig, instruv
tor in business administration in
which he pleaded for a better world
understanding. Nationalism. he said,
with its greedy selfishness is hard to
overcome, and when nations of the
world co~opemte it is generally only
from stark necessity. Such union, Mr.
Craig believes is bound to be tome
porary and unsatisfactory.
“America will not find success in
peace except where it is forced to
a truce by necessity," he continued,
"unless she shows repentance from
imperialism and greedy’xlationalism.”
He recommended three measures
as a means of bettering world spirit.
These included a program of educa-
tion in self guilt for each nation; an
international convention of penitence
in which the nation will east the beam
out of its own eye, and an investiga—
tion by that convention of such world
problems as disarmament and tariff.
