Historical questions Investigation of identity

Pablo Silva, History, answ=t:d a few quesrions related to the
conﬂict in Guntcmala.

How was ﬁt: United States involved in the overthrow of thc
democratic government in Guatemala?

The CIA organized the operation at tho bsircsr of the
Eisenhowcr adxninlstmciom After thc overthrow, the CIA then conr
spired to make sure a hardlinc, tandghr gcncral vims installed as
President.

Was the CIA involved in the Rio Negro massacre?

I have no information on the subject. But i would be very
surprised if the CIA were involved dircctly Like ether militarics.
Latin Amerimn militants don’t nced direct supcnrision to mass}
cmc iliatis.

In 1999 the United Nations-sponsored Commission for His-
torical Clariﬁcation declared this massacre an “act ofgenocide."
What is the political signiﬁcance of this declaration?

Romains to bsscsn. In tho recent clscrion Rios Montt did very
well. On the other hand, h: didn’t win. So you could say that the
chocidc label might irayc prcvcntod his cloction. or you could
arguc that it didn‘t notictably hurt his popularity. Tho long-tum
inﬂuente may be clearer.

How did govcrnment soldiers coerce Mayan ci ans to para
licipat: in th: massacre of psopls in nsighboring villagss?

This was common practicc in scvcral ccntral American counr
rrirs, Sometimes people wcrc forced to rotturc and hill at gun.
point. Sometimes village Councils were given a list or alleged
silbvetsives and mid simply to provide tho corpses. it is not un-
hcard or, so that part ofthe nrovic is onrirtly plausible. There is a
John saylcs movi: that has a particularly graphic scene ofsuch
killings.

Why are there still so many cinndtsrino graves?

Some people justwant to iorgot. pur tirt past in the past. Orin
ei's want the details. Diffrrcnt communities take diffcicnt tip-
ptozichcs.

What has been rho rcsponsc ofthe n=w government to family

Discovering Dominga, cont. from p. 5

the Guatemalan military oihcors responsible for th: massacrss,
and the us, govcrnrntnr provided financial backing for [lie coup.
The n:w Guatemalan government wanted to build rhc Chixoy
Dam. funded by th: World Bank and IntetcAmctican Develop-
mcnt Bank. Building the darn would entail the appropriation of
indigenous villages in rho arta, including Rio Ncgro. thn Achi

r:linquish their land, UrSrtrained soldiers ofrhc Guatemalan gov»

Th: second time Beckct visited Rio Negro, sh: :xamined the
effects ofthe Chixoy Dam. “The river is gone,” she said. “it’s iust

than 75 cland=stine gravu in Rnhinal. He recalled a woman who
dcfcndcd herself against the soldiers by throwing a rock at them,

Becker usrd liar innuoncc as an American citizen and subjccr
ora documentary to push for rirr exhumation otthc clandtstinc
gi‘nvcs. “The ﬁlming put a lot of prcssurt on [tho Guartrnalan
gov:ininent],” she said, Becker also pointed out that while most
survivors could neithtr mid not writs, she and her translators
could pcnnon tlrt goycmmcnr. “I can do a world ordirrortncs
for them," she said. She petitioned to have her father cxhiimed so
that he could be buried next [0 her rnotiror “I really do lropo that
[my dad] knows [lliu' I'm fighting for him and {lint he didn’t die
for no reason," she said

At ﬁlst, Rocker blamed the people ooncoc, a noiglrboring
yrilngo, for tho minder ofhri parcnrs. Soldiers cocrccd those Vllr
lagels into participating in tilt» rnossactos by murdering rhcm if

said. “No onc could crasc my memory. but l'm .r patror’ kid and

Beckﬂ' now says [l‘ml the U 8, Anti Guatemalan governments,

Although slit torgayc rhc Mayan individuals who were both
victims and victimizers, Bcclccr wanrcd tire Guarcrnalan military
to publicly admit its wrongdoing, so slrc providcd rcsrimony to
tho Genocide Committe: in Guatemala “You would think a gene»

the said, “I’ve heard through my contact in Guatemala that it

From personal to political

After oncoming Dnmmgrl nircd on PBS in 2003, it was ac.

on HBO. The intensely political statement of Becker’s personal
storynns most cvidsnr when Dita/wring Dmnmgil playcd in Gun»

“With Dlrmwi'ilig Dominga at a ﬁlm festival the 52m: wocitcnd

she said

Beckcr hopes to continue her political activism by one day
arrcnding a protest against the sthool of the Amcricas (SOA),
