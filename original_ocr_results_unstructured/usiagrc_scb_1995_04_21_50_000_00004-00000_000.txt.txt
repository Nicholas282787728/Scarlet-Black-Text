Chinese Studies rumor prompts evaluation of SEPCs’ role

By ELIZABETH MACKEY
Sta ff Writer
ECENTLY, a rumor about the
RCllinese Studies curriculum be-
ing replaced by a Japanese cur-

riculum plagued students takingChinese
courses. Several who memajoring in the
subject reared that they would have to
msfer because none of the professors
were ramming. The rumois have since
been dispelled by both faculty and ad-
muiistmtjon. Some ask, where was the
SEPC? Should theSEPChave taken any
responsibility for ending the rumors?

Thisquestion reﬂects agenemllaek
or knowledge on campus about Student
Educational Policy Committees. Most
first years have no clue as to what they
are, while third and fourth year students
are genemlly aware that SEPCs existzuid
also have some opinion as to the impor-
tance and effectiveness of theirrole. But
what is that role exactly?

SEPCs are in place in order to rep-

iesent srudent opinion during tenure rcr
Views and the hiring pioccss. During
tenure rcVicws, SEPCs conduct student
interviews (usually l'orty) in order to
gather the general consensus of students
regarding the professor. TheSEPCsalso
typically attend the presentations given
by candidates for open faculty positions
and meet with each candidate. In both
cases. the SEPC members then discuss
their opinions of tlle candidates for tone
ure orafacully positionnnd present their
ﬁnal opinion in a letter to the department
chair. The faculty makes the final deci-
sion on tenure and new faculty members,
but the SEPC provides a way to include
students in that decision.

“Considering how much Grinnell
likes to stress the teaching side of the
professorship,asopposedtotliereseztrch.
I think it's really imponant to let the
professors know how the students feel
about thequalityof teachingthal goes on,
thhouttheSEPCs you losealotol'thth"

said senior Dnve Bode, member or the
History stare.

Does the opinion of the SEPC really
matter in the long run? the question is
hard to answer because orl most of the
important issues. the SEPCs rind the
faculty usuallycometothe sarneconclu-
sions. withoutnn instance oi’conﬂicuiig
opinions to examine, it’s difﬁcult to de-
termine how mucll weiallt the SEPC
opinion actually carries.

“r think it's impoitani though tor
student input to be in there cvcii il’ the
students and professors are on the same
wavelength," said senior Jason Gross.
member of die Economics SEPC.

The perception of each SEPC by
students varies widely This isdue to the
varying nature in membership require
merits, election polictes, ﬂcuvrlies and
level of involvement in the dcpamiicnt
between SEPCs.

For example, some SEPCs are
elected by their fellow majors, while

some are open to anyone interested. The
Sociology nnd the English stare both
consist of ﬁve elected majors On the
other hand the Music SEPC consists of
any interested students, “We even have
SEPCswho nren’tmajors,"sziid Alldlcw
Rosacker, Chair of the Music SEPC,
As far as activities are concerned,
thc variety is astounding. The French
SEPC organized the Harris Mardi Gras
patty. opened a VAX account, sent out
two newsletters and organized a study
abroad tnecungllhc Philosophy SEPC IS
trying to organize :1 Philosophy
Colloquium. Today, a tea IS being held
by IthnglishSEPCintlleSouthLiounge.
Most SEPCS are not used by lellow
students as a forum for concerns with the
depamnents. "Students talk to profes
sors. lfwe have aprobleln, \velolkto our
adviser about it." said Gross. This may
reﬂect good student/ﬂdvrsorrelationships
rather than inadequate usage oror igno
rance about the existence of the SEPCsl

While most SEPCS seem sallsr
t’ied with their relationship with the
faculty, some wish to see improve»
ment. SctiiorSociology SEPC Megan
Killmersaid,“I‘mhappywithllicwny
mydcparlmentseesusliutnotwiththc
way the school secs us. i wish the
administration and the faculty as a
whole would give us more respect
than they do. They don' i see the
amount ofefrort we put into it,"

The SEPCs can provide a valu—
able resource for students who wish
to seriously inﬂuence the courses
and professors they have to chose
from. “It really gives students in the
major a Chance to decide which di-
rcction they want the department to
go in," said Dave Colltnan, junior
Philosophy major. With the recent
demand for more diversity in both
courses and faculty, more use of
these committees may be coming
