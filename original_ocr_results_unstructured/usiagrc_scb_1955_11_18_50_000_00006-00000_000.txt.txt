Hampton Exchange Plan Offers
New And Different Experiences

by Marv Olsen

Would you like to spend next semester at an out-
standing Negro college in the South, with the experience
of living and studying for several months in a new and
different cultural setting and in another part of the coun-

try?

Since 1946 Grinnell has had a student exchange pro-
gram with Hampton Institute in Hampton, Va, the pur-
pose of Which is to provide ”an opportunity for Negro and
white students to understand each other better through the

. social ex erience of liv-
ing in educational institu-
tions made up primarily of
those of another race” Ap—
plication for this year’s ex-
change should be made now.

As the program is now set
up, two or three Grinnell Stu»
dents attend Hampton during
the second semester, and the
same number of their students
come here. Sophomores and
juniors are eligihle, although
sophomores are prefered be-

cause it is easier lor them to
adjust their academic schedule,
and no distinction is made in
regard to sex. Selection
made on the basis ot “social
maturity, grades, character,
and sincere interest in the
program.”

Although no Grinnell stu-
dents have participated in this
program in the last three
years, with the result that

is'

parents giving their approval of
your participation is also re-
quired.

Academic cheating on the
Grinnell campus has not been a
sudden occurancc, so the sud-
den sharp Concern over this
corruption is not revealing its
existence for the first time,
Many have recognized its pro
scnce ovcr a long period of
time. However, it has become so
flagrant that thes persons and
others are through tactily oh—
scrving and are demanding that
something be done to curb the
problem. -

It is no longer a matter of

barmlcssly getting awny with
a- clever idea, but has grown
to disgusting proportions
Those students who work hard
and honestly for their grades
only to see the cheater pull
the high mark (particularly in
some courses), tliosc students
who believe in the supposed
development of maturity and
moral will power while in col.
lege, those students concerned
with upholding the reputation
and tradition of Grinnell, want
a solution to this problem oi
cheating.

Since these students compose
the great majority of the stud
ent body and since the majority
rules in a democracy, move-

ments toward attacking the
problem have been initiated.
Groups oi students, the Student
Council, and the faculty have
adopted it as campus enemy

There are thosc among our

“Try-Em”

 

there is now no one on cam—
pus who has been there, the
approximately 15 students who
have gone to Hampton since
the beginning or the exchange
have all been vigorously en-
thusiastic about the plan. in
one way or another many of
them have said that the ex-
perience of living in such a
situation has helped them
greatly appreciate more
fully the problem that con-
fronts the Negro in our
society. They have also said
that they were welcomed most
warmly there, were accepted’
by everyone, and had a grand
time the whole semester.

The over-all charge at
Hampton is substantially less
than at Grinnell, so even with
increased transportation costs
students going there should
save money. Because of this
lower cost, a scholarship held
here does not apply there, but

Hampton has an Army ROTC
program, which will satisfy

ROTC unless one desires to
enter the advanced prograrnr
If you are interested in this
exchange program, turn in your
application to Dean of the
Chapel Winston L. King, by
Wednesday, Dec. 7. This appli-
cation should consist of a letter
stating why you want to go to
Hampton, why you believe you
are qualified for selection, and
