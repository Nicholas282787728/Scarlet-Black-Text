5H8 tact that Miss Smith‘s

work has increased so
much that an assistant is neces
sary, as reported rn another col-
umn, is ahundant proot tlrat her
work is being greatly appree
ciated. It was stated last fall,
that the securing of Miss Smith
was merely an experiment, and
that the future provision for in
struction in her department, would
depend largely upon the use that
was made oi the opportunity then
offered. That the trustees did
wisely Miss Smith
cannot be questioned, zindthetact
that her work has increased so
rapidly, would indicate that there
are both a great neetl and a strong
demand [or the instruction which
she gives. The good eiiects or
her teaching have already ap.
peared in the oratorlcal contest
and inter-society debaze, as well
as in the Required English classes,
and create the hope in the minds
ot those who are directly interest»

made a permanent part of the

yet are neglected each registration
day, rrrll not be out at the way,
It every student looks up the
mattei as well as he can and has
clearly in mind what studies he
wants he can save himself and his
registrar a good deal oi annoy-
ance. This is a simple thing yet
a great deal of unnecessary
trouble is caused by the neglect
of students to do what they can
in this way. And register early.
Delays will occur in spite of the
greatest care, and by beginning
early they can be made much less
troublesome than when registrar
tion is put off till the last moment.
