Camels add the charm of living

WHETHER through the tasks of
every day, or in life’s moments of
crisis and great reward, the corn-
iort and understanding of Camel
cheers us on out wily. For no other
cigarette was ever so friendly, so
loyal as Camel. The unfathomecl
goodness, the deep underlying
quality of Camel tobaccos is
ever-dependable.

The world’s largest tobacco or-

ganization buys the best of every-

thing for Camels. The choicest
Turkish and Domestic mbaccos

grown. The kind of blending that
only such a group of experts could
give. Regardless of what you are
willing to pay, there is no other
cigarette like Camel; there can be
no better cigarette made than
Camels. Camels never tire the
taste, no matter how indefatigably
you smoke them, never leave a
cigarerty after-taste.

If you don’t yet know Camel
enjoyment, just ‘sanlple’ the most
exquisite fragrance that ever came.
from a cigarette. Hove a Camel!
