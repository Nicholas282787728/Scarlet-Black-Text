Tennis wins last home match

Class of 09 plays their last matches in Grinnell and sweep Central College 9—0,

BY MICHAEL SCIIUEIJ

On Wednesday, beautiful weather graced the tennis
courts as the mens tennis team swept Central College 9-0
at rhc last home march for seniors Dan LilFountaim: '09,
Nate Fox '09, and Tommy Johnson ’09.

“It hasn’t quite sunk in yet," s d captain Fox, who has
been playing for the last ten years. “It’s sort or nostalgic
and it's etc ing at the same time but I
know I’m going to miss this place."

Fox and his fellow seniors will be
missed by the rest oi the team for their
propensity to win as well as their lead—
ership.

“Nate and Dan have been huge for
this tcam," said Sam Rnifc '10, “Nor
only have they led on the court getting
Wins in pretty much every match, but
they're always the ones organizing offs
court"

Since their first year, the senior
class has won a conference champions
ship every year, a difficult fear that will be hard to replicate.

“Wc'rc losing the two big guns in the lineup," said

Couch Andy Hamilton '85, “Maybe this is the first time
that it's beginning to set in that they won’t be with us next
car.
) Although the Pioneers have suffered some losses, in-
cluding one to Coe College on April 11, the team (14.
8) remains conﬁdent heading into the Final stretch of the
season,

(oath Andy Hamillon’85

“So we talked as a team about getting a little more focused
and we had a very very good practice on Monday. I want to
work through our bump in the road at Coe."

On Wednesday, that focus and hard work was on dis—
play against Central.

“We played very well with the 970 victory," Hamilton
saidt “\Vc need to pick up our energy level for the final part

of the season and charge on."

Early this season, Hamilton sched-
uled several ranked reams, such Waslr
ington University, in order to prepare
his team for that level of competition.
He sees that rough schedule paying off

“The facr ofrhe matter is we're now
14-8 and our eight losses have come to
very good teams,” Hamilton said. “It’s
hard as a Grinnell student to be for
cused and play well on a class day and
quite frankly, this is as well as we'v:
played in years on a class day."

The team still has a few tough matches before confer-
en o. This weekend they play Knox and Monmouth for the
di sional rirle and the weekend after that the team traw
els to Decorah, Iowa to tace Luther and Wisconsin Eau-
Claire. But as the season draws to a close, the excitement
is palpable.

"we’ve had a tough schedule thus far," Raife said, “esp:-
eially the last month or so and so everyone is playing really
well right now, We're looking good going into Conference

play, "
