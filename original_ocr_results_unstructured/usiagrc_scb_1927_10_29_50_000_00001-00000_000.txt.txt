Origin of American Indian Matter
Of Speculation, States the
Harvard Lecturer.

PROBLEM RED MAN IS FOOD

Deplores Type of Indian Fiction
Written by Romancers and
Seutimentalists. ‘

“We cannot understand the history
of western migration unless we know
the American Indian," said Professor
Frederick Mei-k in the second of a
series of lectures on the "History of
the West." This lecture was delivered
Thursday evening in A, R, H. auditorir
ium.

“The ori in of the American Indian
is a matter of speculation,” the Ear-
vard lecturer stated, "but the most
popular theory is that the American
,Indian is a native originially of north
central Asia. or Mongoloid stock, he
resembles the Chinese and the Eskimo.
Physical similarities point toward a
common origin."

Professor Merk also said that culr
tura'l traits indicated the Indians re—
lationship to the Mongoloid stock. But
the professor stated that some com-
mon traits of that stock were not
found in the Indian ci ilizations,

Glacier lurid - Groups.

“This may be explained", he said,
"by the theory that the great migrar
tion took 'place prior to the last gla~
cler movement and that, as the glacier
separated the Indians into two groups,
only the most primitive traits were re—
tained."

“It is fortunate for the white race
that the Indian numbers were so low
and that the Indians north of Mexico
were in such a low state of culture,"
the lecturer continued.

if North America had contained wide
areas of intensive agricultural possi-
bilities, the Indians living on that
land would have reached a high state
of civilization by the time of the Euro-
pesn settlement of North America, acA
cording to Professor Mark, With this
advanced civilization they would have
absorbed European culture and nation-
sl characteristics.

The Indian problem has always
turned about food, said the lecturer.
He further explained this fact by nam—
ing the food areas of North and South
America. The caribou and bison areas
were inhabited by primitive, roving
tribes; the salmon, wild seed, and
maize areas, by better civilized tribes
of Indians; and the intensive agricul—
tural regions, by the highest Indian
civilizations, such as the Incas of Fe~
ru and the Aztecs of Mexico,

Inlllun Population Unknown.

The lecturer said that there is no
way of determining the Indian popula—
tion of North America at the time of
the European settlement, but that it
was probably not more than 1,250,ooo.
In spite of this small population the
North American continent north of
Mexico contained fiftyesix linguistic
groups. Some of these groups had de-
veloped confederations similar to that
established under the American Arti-
cles of Confederation.

The lecturer outlined the develop-
ment of Indian civilization up to the
entrance of Europeans. Up to the time
of the European trader, the Indian had
been advancing in trade and govern—
ment. But the introduction of the ri-
fle, rum, and disease rapidly broke

. down Indian sellrsutﬂcieucy and inde-
pendence.

Professor Merk deplored the type of
Indian fiction written by sentimental—
ists and romancers. He said that the
“haze of indian summer" was used too
frequently in fiction of this type.

Indian Needed Time.

But in conclusion the lecturer stat-
ed, "if the Indian had been left to
himself for one thousand years longer
he might have developed into some—
thing higher and better, The tragedy
of Indian life is that the blow was
struck when the lndlan civilization
was at its most promising stage. The
way in which the Indian was dispos—
sessed is one of the reproaches to
American civilization."

Professor Merck will give the third
of his series of lectures on Monday
night in A. R. a. auditorium at 7; 5.

Basketball Coach
Issues First Call

Yesterday; First Games Are
December 16 and 1'7.

John c. Truesdaie, coach of the
Grinuell basketball squad, sent out a
call yesterday afternoon for basket—
ball candidates Lu report immediately
for practice. The first Crinnell cage
games are on December 16 and 17.
with the two Oklahoma schools.

Ten men reported to Coach Trues~
dale, including three lettermen. A

practice until after the last football
game an No'vember 19. Practices will
be held three times a week, and funda»
mentals will receive the main parL 0f
the drill, according to the Pioneer
mentor.

Three Letter-men Report

Lettermen who reported to Truss-
dale were; coggeshall, and Peterson,
torWards, and Mark, center. These
three men should all be among thc
leading five members of the Pioneer
squad this winter. ‘Coggeshail was one
of the leading scorer: in the confer-
ence on a weak team, and this year
should be in his element among a
group'of fairly capable performers.

Lovejoy, struhle and Ingram, all
members of last years squad. but who
received no experience as far as games
are concerned, reported. Lovejoy is a
fine guard and has an excellent chance
of occupying a regular defensive posi-
lion. Su‘uhle and Ingram are both
handicapped because of their size,

Harold Wilhelm, captain of last

, year's yearling Court team also report—

ed, and is looked upon by many as one
01 the leading prospect's for the Cen-
ter position. Tall and heavy, Wilhelm
possesses a fine eye for the basket and
should fit into the local machine very
handily.

Investment and Speculation Class
Gains Experience Through Practice

To make their class in Investments
and Speculation more practical, stu-
dents taking this course. under Prof.
Earl D. Strong, have formed an invest-
ment pool and are engaging in buying
and selling on the New York stock can
change.

It was voted at the first of the year
take up a collection from the class
and from 'any outside persons interestr
ed to form this pool. With funds ag-
gregating $600 for various forms of in—
vestments on hand, a committee coin-
posed of Loren Hill, chairman, George

Wilson and Eugene Egan was appoint-
ed to investigate conditions of various
stocks on the market.

On their recommendation the class
bought, through a broker, five shares
of Studebaker Motors, com on, and
suld five of Wright Aeronautical, both
on margins of 25 per cent. That is,
the class had to pity 25 per cent of the
value or these stocks to control them
and to protect their hrokcr from fluctr
uatluns in the market. A total of 3160
has been invested in these two stocks.

 

Pick Four Seniors
For Phi Beta Keys

Murray, Jensen, Margaret Lemley,
Mary Barlow, Grant Smith
Honored Yesterday.

Murray Jensen, Grant Smith, Mary
Barlow and Margaret Lemley were
presented with Phi Beta Kappa
shingles by Pres. J. H, T. Main in
chapel yesterday. The four new mem-
bers were elected at a meeting of the
Grinnell chapter Monday afternoon in
accordance with the custom of elect-
ing in the fall the two men and the
two women in the Senior class Who
have the highest scholastic rankings.

Pros. )[iliu Speaks.
President Mftln deplored the paucity
of independent thought and stressed
the respauslhility of a Phi Beta Kaﬁpn
in the world. in spite of the fact that
to the World, the key means no more
than caviare does to a kangaroo, it is

a worthwhile honor, President Main
said.

”The tragedy of Christianity is that
it has standardized itself with the
world, instead of challenging the
world. The paragraphers in the daily
papers make fun of college people who
go out to reform the World. It is the
tragedy of education also that college
men and women conform to it rather
than reform it," Mr. Main asserted.
“Challenge the World!” was the mes-
sage he gave to the new Phi Beta Kap-
has.

Additional elections to the fraternity
will be made from the senior class in
the spring.

Moccasined Mamie Sends Reply to

Naive Epi

The whole college was extremely
over—joyerl to receive your naive letter,
and the freshmen have simply de-
voured it. Miss Luella J. Read used it
to supplement her lecture on college
adjustment in freshman education
class. It was astounding, however, the
number of words which she mispro-
nounced such seemingly simple
words, too! And Dean J. F. Findlay!
i-ie borrowed the epistle for his fresh-
msn lecture last Thursday. and is
making negotiations with‘ the SCAR-
LET AND BLACK for permission to
preserve it for the future benefit of
little Cornelia Prltchard. (May she
always appreciate her thoughtful ta»
thert) We forgot to mention that due
to your splendid advice, there was a
smaller attendance than usual at both
classes,

A great many things around the
campus are the same as when you
were here, and a,greut many are dif—
fereut. Among the former, the League
Board has fixed it so that Alice Ro-
damnr is again receiving flowers. WP
hear that Mercedes Jelsma is also suc—
cessful, even without the assistance of

 

the league Baird.

stle of Snoshoo Alyce

Among the latter, a new intra-murzll
athletic contest has been added to stl~
mulftte the interest in athletics. It
has been rumored that Mrs. ottiiie T.
Seybolt and Pruf. H. S. Canard will
stage a cross-Country bicycle race in
the near future, Odds are on Mrs.
Seybolt, for it is expected that She will
make a dramatic finish.

And more news, dear auntie! At
last the school has realized the use-
lessness of electric lights in the li~
hrary. For one entire evening the
“lights-out" plan was adopted, and
from all reports it was extremely suc-
cessful. (Some of the "reports" were
louder than others). The next morn-
ing those who had gone to the library
to study were found asleep.

Well, auntie, We all appreciate your
helpful letter, and we hupewou'll be
uhle to Send us some more good at]-
vice from the big City,

Remember us 20 Snoslwe Al.
Distantly yours,
Moccasined Mamie.
P. s. We’d like to know how you are
getting along with your M. A. (Mas-
ter of Architects) degree

The life of the Chinese farmer was
the chief topic discussed by Mr. Wang
Yllan-Hsing of Shahtung, China, in a
talk given to the World Fellowship
club last Wednesday evening,

Mr. Wang illustrated his talk with
a display of various curios from Chi-
na, such as pen and ink, a geography
and a Chinese letter. He closed his
lecture by writing several of the simp-
ler Chinese characters.

Mrs. C. E. Payne will talk at the

British Explorer
To Give Lecture

Captain Noel Will Open Lecture
. Course at Congregational
Church Tuesday.

Captain John B. Noel, British ex-
plorer and photographer, will open
the college lecture course next Tues»
day evening, when he gives an illus-
trated lecture in the Congregational
church, "on the Roof of the World."

in words and pictures Captain Noel
will explain the 192i expendition to
Mount Everest, where a company of
ﬁve hundred men aided in establish-
ing a new altitude record of 28,009
feet. It required the lives of two
men to set that record, after they had
ventured within 800 feet of the Sum-
mit, which was a conquest that the
old King of the Himalayas would not
permit.

The whole gripping story of the ex—
pedition was caught and preserved by
Noel with his fourteen specially con—
structed cameras which by means of
a telescopic lens, were able to get plc<
tures of the furthest penetration ,of
the explorers. The physical courage,
as well as the scientiﬁc accuracy.
which was required for such exquisite
photography under almost impossibly
trying conditions, speak eloquently for
the qualities of the quiet man who
will speak in Crinnell Tuesday even-
ing.

Uncovers Facts About Tibet.

Along with the titanic struggle to
conquer Everest, the expedition uncav~
ered many signiﬁcant facts about na-
tive life in Tibet, the stronghold of
Buddhism and old»fashioued Oriental
customs. Captain Noel's camera was
also busy in that ﬁeld, and he will
bringshere some interesting revela-
tions about customs among the people
of the Himalayas, where, until a few
years ago, no white men were permit
ted. to penetrate.

Captain Noel‘s illustrated lecture
will begin at eight o'élock Tuesday
evening, and will be held in the Con-
gregational church auditorium. Sc-
mester fee coupons and season tickets
will admit. Single admission is one
dollar,

Twenty—two Pioneer football men
trot into the Marquette university sta-
dium this afternoon filled with a
strong determination to turn the Hill-
top team back for the second success—
ive year. Last year's Grinuell foot—
ball team surprised the experts by
scrambling over the Golden Avalanche
for a 17-2. win, an upset in the dope
bucket for almost all experts.

' Suffers Three Setbacks.

The Milwaukee team this season
has has suffered three set—backs, all
by teams of high calibre. The Army de-
feated Coach Frank Murray's team by
a 2142 margin, which denoted that
the Marquette team had scoring
punch: the Oklahoma Aggies turned
back the Hilltopers by an 8—0 score at
Stillwater, and Creighton defeated her
ancient Catholic rival by a 13—0 count ‘
last weekend. These reverses do not
indicate that the Marquette team is
without strength, for practically the
some’team that had such a successful
season last year returned to the Mil- '
waukee school again this season. The
Murray team seems to have had more
than its share of injuries during this
season, but at the present, according
to reports circulated from Milwaukee,
the Avalanche entered their Homecom-
ing game with the Pioneers in the best
possible condition, ,
Coach Watt's Crinnell team entered
the fray minus the services of two reg— '
nlars, Contain Dav-ls, who will prob-
thly not be in shape before the Wis~ ‘
oonsin game, and Kilnefelter, who is
still limping painfully from an injury
incurred before the Drake game.
Locke Eligible.

However, the Pioneer ranks have
been greatly reinforced by the addition
of Jack Locke, husky fullback, who
became eligible at the first of this
week. Locke has been one of the
outstanding backfield performers in,
practice sessions this fall, but has
been kept on the bench because of a
scholastic deficiency. Fireworks are
bound to start for the Marquette team
this afternoon if this Pioneer hack
breaks into the lineup.

Coach Watt has drilled a set of new
plays into the Crinnell team during
the past week which seem to embody
the cork—screw principle used so cf-
tectively by the 1926 Pioneer team
against the Marquette team. These
plays worked well against the fresh
team in scrimmage sessions this week,
and seem to have settled the question
of a fast offense for a fairly slow-
moving backfield.

Marquette sent a veteran team
against the Pioneers this afternoon, es-
pecially in their backfield o-Keefc.
Gebert, Crowlcy and Leary all playing
against Crinneli in Milwaukee last
year. Leary, the Marquette captain has
been playing a strong game all year,
as has Cebert. O'Keefe has not as yet
broken into his usually brilliant form,
but can be counted on to provide the
drinnell tacklers with a good deal or
<llppery running.
