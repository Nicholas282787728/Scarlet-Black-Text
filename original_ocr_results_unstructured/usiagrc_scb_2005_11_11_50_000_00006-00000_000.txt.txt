Dining to add
100 new jobs

Expanded dining hours and numerous diaercnt serv-
ing venues will mean up to 100 more student employees
for Dining Services next year. according to Dick Williams,
the department's director

Employed students will still do tasks such as loading
and unloading, tnty hreaksciown and janitorial duties,hut
shifts will be changed to accommodate both the increase
in employees and the new dining hours. More students
will he assigned to “cook’s helper" positions involving roles
preparing food in front ofsmdcnts.

Because the dining halls will he open later and lore
get, student workers schedules may change signiﬁcantly.
Though this may mean more opportunity for schedule
ﬂexibility, some students are woriied that the latei hours
will cut into their work, “If you think about it, for college
students, two hours is prohahly all they can afford to work
and not. get totally lost," said Dining Services employee
Alisha Sui/11.1509.

Students also voiced concerns that students would be
overworked hy the new scheduling. “if there will just he
more shifts open, that would be really good,” said Jenn
Dalton ’09. “But not ifitjust meant that students were
working longer hours.” ‘

“There’s no expectation that [workers] will have to
work longer shifts," said Williams. The longer shifts will
he split up so single students won’t have to work more
than the usual twtrhour shifts.

There are also students who will welcome the change
in service hours. “As a diner, I would he pleased hecause

I eat at odd hours," said Sally Webster '08.

Uncertain future

for Quad,

Cowles

Concerts in Quad, apartments in Cowles among
options being considered for to-be empty space

With food lines, soda fountains and
tiny lines scheduled for removal after the
end oftlic school year, the space occupied
hy Cowles and Quad dining halls could
he changed to ideas as varicd as concert
venues or FWOtSKOIy apartment suites.

Though plans are still not definite
for the future of the
two facilities, admin—
isriatois and student
government have heen
working together to
ensure that the space
will not go unused.

According to SGA
President John Bohm-
an, one of the original
idcas for the use of
Cowles—among sug
gestions such as a bowl
ingalleyaloungespaee
and a meeting spaceiwas to turn the
building into townhousetstyle apartments
for students. With these apartments in
place, iesidcnts could have a fccl ofinde-
pcndence fmm the college while remain-
ing in the midst of campus activity.

When the blueprints were drawn up
for the housing. however, the cost was
much higher than cxpectcd, and the ad
ministration had to reconsider the idea.
Currently, a ﬁrm is reedrawing piints to
try and cut costs and make the option af-
fordable foi the college.

"it’s a huge undertaking," said Vice
President for Student Services Tom
Cindy. “The ﬂoor of Cowles would have
to he lower-ed, and we just have to ﬁgure
out wliclher lhiit's feasible." if the plan
were enacted. the area above the dining
hall steps would become regular student
iooms, while the kitchen area and dining
hall aiea would be renovated into town-
house-style ioonis.

According to Crndy, several years ago,

feaiable.”

”[Aparlmenl—ilyle living would
be] a huge undertaking. The
floor (ﬂow/rs would have to
be lowered, and wejuil have
to ﬁgure out whether that’s

Tom Crady, vice president for

students were opposed to creating housing
that would supply diffcrcnt classes with
different styles ofliving. Now he feels that
there is a call for that kind ofhousing. “It
would be different than North, South and
East eatnpiis,"he said. “The only drawhaek
is that the housing would probably go to
mainly juniors and
seniors."

Some students
didn’t see that as a
problem. “Even now,
just hy being a junior
or a senior, you get
hetter choices," said
Susan Vcscovi ’06.

As for the future
of Quad, the plans
are less certain. Be
cause lots of spaces are
opening up, some will
not be allocated right away. According to
Boliinan, the college will wait to see what
is lacking before taking action. Seine sug-
gestions for mall’s future include special
event space, a space for trustee meetings,
study space, an addition to Bob’s or a
concert space,

“I’d like to see it used dayetOeduy," said
Bchman. “I think it’ll be better if it's a
place that students can use regularly."

There is also discussion of turning
Quad into a venue for student parties.
Because Gardner is not an ideal place for
sizable gatherings, the large space that
Qlad provides could be ideal. “Gardner is
a tough space," said Crady, “but we don't
want to upset members of Main Hall
when there’s a big concert."

Because of the many issues that Vi’Ll.l
decide the future of the two buildings, the
administiarion is “tiying to keep an open
mind."“lt’s all kind ofup in the air right
now,"said Crady. “We need more time to
really think about it,"
