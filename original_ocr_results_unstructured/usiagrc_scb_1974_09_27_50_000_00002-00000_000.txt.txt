For years they new known as
“farm hands.” Thcy worked long
hours for subsistence iiagcs, lived
in low quality housing, and en
dured the dangers ol pesticides.
Surviving from day to day under
the most inhuman working coii~
ditioiis, they more often than not
died long before reaching the life
expectancy oi the average
American. Today they are “farm
workers." moving sloivly up the
economic ladder. but this progress
is as precarious now as it has
always been

\'.I‘.W.conti‘ cts

Much of the progress achieved
by farm workers in recent years
has resulted from the efforts of
Cesar Chavez and the United Farm
Workers. They Ilave succecded in
doubling wages, and have changed
the attitudes at many growers
towards tlielr workers.

Workers employed under union
contracts have also gained for the
first time, bathroom facilities,

benefit has eliminated the hated
labor contractor system, and thus
provided job security Child labor
has Come to an end, and the use of
dangerous pesticides has fallen
under close supervision,

The benefits of fair labor
representation have extended to
the growers as well as to the
workers Time magazine reported
recently that from 1557 to

1972, the production capacity of
Gallo Wines increased from 70,000
cases per day to 150,000 cases per

Today, however. lhe U F, W
faces a new challenge, both in the
California fields and elsewhere
The Western Conference of
Teamsters, with a history of union-
husting collusion stretching hack
to 1931;, has been signing contracts
with many California growers
since 1070. Many or these growers
were formerly under U. F w.
Contracts.

The Teamsters have had the
active support of the growers in
recruiting members in the fields,
and with good reason. Tcamster
Contracts are most often
“sweetheart” contracts, omitting
many of the benefits to workers
listed in the U. F, W. contracts,
Protection against the dangers of
pesticides, for instance, are rarely
provided for in Tcamster con
tracts. The contract negotiations
have been carried out before the
Teamster representatives have
even entered the holds to begin
signing up workers. Worker
participation in the negotiation
process.'thei-eiore, has been ims

Once contracts have been
signed, the workers are coerced
into joining the Teamsters, and
most growers have avoided

dealing with the U, F W , whose
membership has rapidly declined.
The Teamsters say the U. F W.
has lost the support of its mem-
bers, while U. r w. leaders say
workers are forced to join the
Teamsters in order to get or keep
most jobs,

The whole problem results from
the fact that farm workers are not
covered by many Federal Labor
laws They do not have the right to
hate in supervised elections to
choose their represcntatives. Thus

Student support

In a few weeks, Grinnell College
students will again be asked to
support the U. F. w. grape and
lettuce boycott. The boycott is the
only weapon at the disposal of the
U r. w. and it has been respon
sible for most of their successes to
date.

The hoycott involves not buying
non-U. F. W head lettuce and
grapes. and abstaining from all

wines. In addition, Grinnell
students will be asked to sign a
petition requesting that Saga
continue to participate in the
boycott. The farm workers need

enjoy lettuce, grapes, and wine as
there are U. F. W contracts, and

It should be cmphaSized that
supporting the U. r w. against the
Teamsters is not an attack on our
present B and G strike. The latter
is a local affair. The U. F. W. is
only concerned with the policy of
the national union, and its actions

— pilot stage

by Elaine ('ni-cy

Iowa Folklife. headed by Ellis
Gordon. junior, has entered its
pilot stage with research into
“Vernacular Arts and Skills”
scheduled for late in the spring
Semester. Iowa Folklife is a
Grinnell college project deSigned
by Gordon to fulfill three goals.

Goals

The ﬁrst at these goals is the
development of a trained student
field research organization con-
centrating on folklore themes and
topics related to lowa and the
midwest. Second is the develop
ment of a field research norkshop
training program. and lastly, after
successful folklile research. is the
publication of the material
gathered in a magazine to be sold
on a subscription basis,

The material would also be made
available to the Iowa Bicentennial
Commission. Further long range
goals of the project are book
publication and record production

The project was created by
Gordon who submitted the
proposal for faculty support last
year before spring break Faculty
supporting the proposal in
advisory capacities include
Douglas Caulkins. anthropology;
Charles Cleaver. American studies
and English, Brian l-iarris, Ger-
man: Rondl Kurtz. anthropology.
Marilyn Leonard, history; and
Joseph Wall. history.

This semester Gordon. along
with Jonas Goodman. is working
on a paper on hold study
techniques and resource center

an independent study under
Cleaver and Wall. Tracy Huling,
sophomore, is aiso assisting in the
project. She is in Chicago on the

Grinnell to conserve

by Patty iinse

Dale L. Hawn. Director of
Grinnell College’s Physical Plant
attended an energy conservation
meeting and seminar on Monday,
September 23 in Des l\’Ioines.
There, representatives of business.
government. and industry
discussed and planned methods of
conserving the ever-dwindling
supply of fossil fuels, elg. oil, and
natural gas, in the Mid-west twith
special attention given to the rural
areas). All three parties ems
phasizeo the tact that; it the
energy crisis is real, and 2) the
price of fossil fuels is increasing
tar faster than the measures being
taken to conserve them What,
then, is the prospect for the
Grinnell College community
during the cold winter to comeii

llawn recently submitted a
report on heat conservation at
Grinnell to President Leggett,
Dean Walker, as well as Messrs.
iambic, Anderson, and Lovejoy.
He is planning another on clcc-
trical energy in the future.
previous to the academic year of
197142 Grinnell College never
acknowledged the existence of an
energy “crisis" or even an energy
shortage The administrative
policies of the College regarding
consumption otheat and electricity
reflected that fact. It was only
after the winter recess oi 1971-72
that offiCial measures were taken
to Conserve heat Those measures
lowered temperatures in the dorms
and classrooms, and closed the

The project will formally get

sessions. These sessions will teach
student researchers how to use

Soil-sufficientmagazine

Sometime in 1975, Gordon hopes
to publish an annual of between 150
lo 200 pages containing the
researched material. The sale of
this annual at fairs in Town and to
libraries, campus bookstores. and
high schools, Gordon sees as
making the magazine selfr
sufficient.

The initial financial burden of
the entire project, until it attains
self sufficiency. is estimated at
$20,000 to $25,000 for research and
printing, including the extensive
travel of students. The college has
donated $2,000 as a starter An
application for a $10,000 grant is
being filed with the National Ens
dowment for the Humanities
iNEHl Several other possible
grants and donations are being
explored by Gordon, who admits
money from ioundations is tight

Nonsfinancial aid has been
promised by the Smithsonian
Institute and the American
