and GALILEO

 

There was much learning but
little real knowledge in Galileo’s
time (1564,1542). Aristotle was
swallowed in bad Latin transla-
tions. Ipse dixit. Noone checked
him by what seemed vulgar,
coarse experiment. ,

Galileo fought against the
dead hand of tradition. He did
not argue about Aristotle, but
put him to the test. Aristotleled
his readers to beliéve that of two
bodies the heavier will fall the
faster. Galileo simply climbed
to the top of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa ‘and dropped two un-
cqual weights. The “best peo-
ple" were horriﬁed; they even
refused to believe the result——
that the weights reached the
ground in equal times.

" Look at the world, and ex-
perunent, experiment,” cried
Galileo.

century was not Galileo in pop.
ular estimation, but Suleiman
the Magniﬁcent, the Ottoman
Emperor, who swept through
Eastern Europe with ﬁre and
sword and almost captured
Vienna. Where is his magniﬁ-
cence now?

Galileo gave us science—s
established the paramount
rightef experimental evidence.
Suleiman did little to help the
world.

Hardly an experiment is made
in modern science, which does
not apply Galileo’s results.
When, for instance, the pllys' —
is ts in the Research Laboratories
of theGeneral Electric Company
study the motions of electrons
in ratiﬁed atmospheres, or exper-
iment to heighten the efﬁciency
of generators and motors, they
follow Galileo’s example and
substitute facts for beliefs.
