Declaration of independents

When 30 available majors failed to meet their needs, 16 current students decided to design their own
requirements and declare independent majors ranging from Biocomputation to Policy Studies

by Josh Cooley

They had 30 possible majors to d'mose from, bur none

orrhem seemed appealing

ies" major. “None or the majors rhar make up my major
were fully appealing," he said, noring rhar his major some
hines course work from the History, Political Science and
Economics deparrmenu. "lnsread of having ro rake some
things I like and some things I didn’t like to fulfill major
requirements, l'm raking much more of whar l wanr
and very little orwhar l don'r wanr."

Zigds is one of 16 current students who have declared
independenr majors. In rhe pasr nine years, 63 students
have graduared wirh Independenr majors, earning degrees
in everyrhing from Human.Compurer lnreracrion to Com»
muniry Developmonr ro Dance Studies.

Some srudenrs eonsrrucr an independenr major based
on a concentntion offered at Grinnell, as has been done
with students who chose an independent major in Africana
Studies. Others form their independent major based on
majors available ar orher colleges and
universrries across the counrry zigas
modeled his four-year plan on the
course work required for a Policy Snidies
major ar rhe Universiry ofMasathusetrs.

While srudenrs majoring in Inter-
national Relations and Neurosclencer
currenrly rhe mosr popular of rhe in»
dependenr majors, can seek advice from
upperclassmen and alumni who de-
dared slmilar majors, students with 16s
common independcnr majors have
more dirhculry oonsrrucring their four-
year plan. These sIudenrs design a
unique major without the help or a
model. For example, Katie Lee ‘04 cre-
ated a major in American Social De-
velopmenr, snucruring her course work vvirhin rhe l—lisa
rory sociology andAntlIropology deparrmenrs in order ro
"emphasize rlIe social and culruIal aspecrs ofAmerican his

tory."
Challenges

"Declaring an independenr major is not as cut and dry
as declaring a regular major" said 5rephanie Henning. rhe
associare regisrrnr, who works wirh Independenr majors.
"independenr majors are jusr kind of rhrown our rhere.
They don’t have rhe nerworking available ro rhem rharorher
srudenrs have."

not unique ro independenr majors, is nor required of all

"There's nor really alor orwiggle room ifyou decide ro
take rhings ouoide oryour major, like elecrives or rhings
that are just inreresring," said Lee.

Zigas agreed, noring rhar, "once you declare, rhere's
an expectation rhar you'll have a very good sense ofwhar

_

study to what your
interests are, and focus

Advantages

But Zigas believes that having his course schedule
planned our for his remaining two years ar Grinnell is also
an advanrage.

“(Declaring an independenr major] forced me to re»
ally [l‘an about what I wanted to do while i was here and
what sorr ofcouisrs I warned ro rake in my ncsr rhrce yous ar
crinnell, more so rhan I irwere a .egular major," he said.

Anorher advanrage—ofbeing an Independenr major is
avoiding rhe requiremenrs posed by osrablished majors

“lfl need ro swnch romorhing In my major plan, Ir's

possible because l can srudy In a wide
vanery ordirrerenr disciplines, said
Lindsey Bulfinch '04, whose Neuro-
science major combines course work
from rhe Biology, Psychology and Phi-
losophy depairmenrs,

"you can railor whar you srudy ro
whar your inrercsrs are," said lee, “and
focus srrongly on a very specific ropic,
so you ger ro be very familiar with what
you're srudying,"

lee also nored that an independenr
major can boost a student's resume.

“when l was Inrerviewing ar rhe
graduare school i am going to,” said
has, who will study next Elli at the Unis
versiry ofTuIsa in Oklahoma, “they
were very impressed by rhe amounr or research I’d done
and rhe mIriarIve l'd raken in erraiing an independcnr ma.
jor.

The majoriry of independenr majors inrerviewed also
believe ir's easier for independenr majors to srudy abroad
because of the ﬂexibility in die requiremenrs needed for an
independenr major.

New Established Majors at Grinnell‘.7

The only independenr major currcnrly popular enough
ro have a shor at arriacring rhe same number ofstutlenrs as
an esrablishcd major is lnrernarional Relarions. Twenrye
eighr of rhe 63 srudenrs who graduared wirh independenr
majors berween I995 and 2003 majored in lnrernarional
RelarionsThose srudenrs most ofren choose Wayne Moyer,
Poliriml Science, In on: of their advisers. since he reaches
“The Politic of International Relations.” Mayer. however,
has not encouraged Grinnell to csrablish an lnrernarional
Relarions major.

“There's agrenr deal ofinrianoe in rhe rypes ofmajors rhar
people do," said Moyer of rhoeesrudenu who major in inter
national Relations, "and they have a flexibility that I'm not sure
rhar rhey would ger wirh one ofrhe mahlished majors."

In rhe pasr 25 years an Grinncll, only rwo new majors
have been created: Chinese in rhc early 1990s and Biologic
cal Chemisrry in 1999. In order for Grinnell ro esrablish a
new major, a group ofraculry members musr design a proc

Future Independent Majors

According ro Hennrng, Academic Advising will work
wirh srudenrs Io design an independenr major. Once stUr
denrs submir rheir proposal for an independcnr major,
Henning and jirn SwarrL. vice presidcnr forAeademic Af»
fairs and dean of the college, will make sure that studtnm’
inreresrs march rheir rcquiremenn for a major.

“Ifir’s nor approved up fronr, you're told whar you can
do can ro gcr it approved," Hennrng said.

"I can only think oronc [proposal] in my six years as
dean that I’ve rurned down," said Swarm, “and rhar was
because rhe srudenr waited unril the lasr minurc ro rry and
switch ro an independenr major."

Chris Forster-Smith ’06, whose major In lnrernarional
Relarions combines course work from rhe PolIrical science
and Frend'l deparrmenc, echoed Henning's senrimenrs,
saying rhar “people are pretty open ro you doing it, lr's
definirely nor frowned upon. lr's a very Grinncll rype of
rhIng. being able ro design your own major."

When srudenrs come inro Henning's office seeking ro
declare an independenr major, rheir biggest concern: are
rhar they don'r know how ro ger srarred. They are unsure
as ro whar Swarn. is looking for in an independenr major,
whom to conraer for help and which advisers ro selccr for
rheir proposed major, '

Henning believes that rhese concerns would he miri.
garcd by holding periodic informarion sessions each se-
mester for ﬁrst-years and undeclared sophomores who are
considering an independcnr major, She noted rhar several
years ago, an alum who had graduaredas independenr major
came back ro campus and rried to nerwork a group ofﬁrstr
years and secondyears who were considering declaring an
independcnr major. However, rhcre has been no movemenr
to hold simllar sessions. According to Swarm, this stems
from the faer rhar rhe various independenr majors declared
by srudenc differ widely Also, she raeulrysralt panels on
"Choosing a Major" rhar are held every semesrer address
rhe issue orindependenr majors.

Advice

The currenr independenr majors have several pIeees or

sidcring Independenr majors.

According ro Forster-Smith, good undidares ror indee
pendenr majors are “people who think of rhemselves as

base orinrcresrs and who wanr ro be able ro combine 3
many drings as possible Inro a major."

“The number ordeparrmeno ar Grinnel] is limired

said lnga lacobs '04, an lnrernarional Relarions major.
“Declaring an independenr major ralres a lirrle work in rhe
