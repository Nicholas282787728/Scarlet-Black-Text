O The Anzacs Again.

One of the bright spots on the shield of the United Nations
in this war has been the outstanding valor and courage shown
by the fighting “Anzacs” from New Zealand and Australia.
We believe that these men from “down under” will have
every opportunity to demonstrate their courage this spring
in the face of a large-scale invasion by the Japanese.

How are the chips stacked for the struggle soon to be—

in?

g First of all, why should the Japs undeltake this hazard-
ous campaign? The risks are great, hilt the stakes are great-
er.

 

Australia stands now as the last outpost of the Allies in
the Far East from which our armed forces may strike back
savagely at the J aps when our machine becomes Well»0lled:

With Australia knocked out, not only would Allied ship-
ping lines to the Orient be severed but the Eastern Front
would be closed to military action of the United Nations for
years to come.

Next, what are the chances of Japanese success? Of
course the immediate advantage of predominant air, sea, and
land power lies with the Nipponese at the outset. But Aus
tralia is a continent larger than the United States.

Japanese experience in China as well as the German ex—
perience in Russia shows what fate ‘befalls a continental in-
vasion of a people determined to fight to the bitter end. Add
to this the vast mountainous and desert wastes in the north
of Australia blocking any Japanese march to the southern
industrial sections and you have a faint idea of the gigantic
task confronting the Nipponese.

We feel that Australia will not fall, largely because the
Allies cannot allow it to fall. So we leave the lighting ”An—
zacs” grimly awaiting their inveterate enemies. The next
“Battle of Britain" may very well take place in Australia.

sorry she had stayed home to
wash her hair. in isn‘t every

steps off the bus Friday night
and spots Ernie's Victory haircut.
Incidentally, Doric predicts acor-

year's prep girls. ,

ALSO ON THE FRIDAY BUS
will be Don Hook's girl from

like a pig weekend.

BY ASSOCIATED COLLEGIATE PRESS

WASHINGTON~(ACP)7 Each
day adds to the likelihood of all—
out registration of women-power
(ages 18 to 65). Secretary of
Labor Perkins predicts that of
15,000,000 workers employed in
war industries by January, 1943,
5,000,000 will be womcn.

o I o
The swing is most dramatic in
war industries. Less startlingi
but of more practical value to col—
lege womeniis the fact that the
swing is taking ploco in almost
every field.
a o o
The Federal Government is
leading the way. Not to mention
those hired “in the field," 600
Women are arriving in Washing-
ton each week to enter Federal
service. Many of them are hired
for administrative, professional
and sub-professional jobs — as
economists, public relations ex—
parts, ammunition inspectors,

Incidentally, there’s no intention
of shouldcring college men out of
this job picture. However, cur-

rent vacancies are for women.
The obvious inference is that men
will he nccdcd elsewher%and
government officials have hardens
ed themselves to the fact. Men
can apply for the jobs mention-
ed above. They aren’t as likely
to get them at present, that’s all.
