Grid hopes ruffled

by Dave Schechter

What can you say when the
football team loses 40712 on
Parents' and Alumni Day in front
of one of the largest crowds of the
season. For Head Coach Edd
Bowers, all that you can do is to put
the loss behind you and think ahead
to the next game. Last Saturday's
loss to Cornell College on Ward
Field did have a couple of bright
spots in it although they were well
disguised by a massive Cornell
offensive output. The Rams totaled
474 yards in total offense to the
Pioneers' 283.

Cornell didn't waste any time
scoring, and it was 17-0 Rams
before Grinnell scored with just
over a minute left in the first half.
That touchdown came on a lsryard
pass from Paul Crane to Paul
Delaney; the extra point cone
version pass failed and the half
ended with Grinnell trailing 17-6.

Saturday Crane completed 7 out
of 19 passes for 53 yards. His back
up, Randy Reavis got his most
action of the season at quarterback
by completing 5 of 12 passes lor 62
yards.

It was not until late in the third
quarter, trailing 23-6, that Grinnell
scored again. John Hamby, who
recovered three fumbles started
the drive by picking up a fumble at
the Cornell 42 yard line. Seven
plays later Crane through another
touchdown pass to Delaney, this
time 7 yards, to give Grinnell at 23-
12 deiecit. Again an attempted 1on
point conversion failed, and by the
cnd of the game the Rams had
added another 17 points for a
convincing win.

The highlight of the fourth
quarter turned out to be a new
record for Cornell. The Rams’
Craig Kouba, the finest kicker in
the conference this year, booted a
55-yard iield goal that gave Cornell
a 3342 advantage at the time.

One has to look to the statistics to
find the rays of hope. Tom Goetz
had another fine game rushing for
91 yards in 21 carries. Delaney and
Jim Casey combined to catch ten

passes for 102 yards. Both teams ,

were generous in giving away the
football. Grinnell had three passes
intercepted and lost three fumbles,
while Cornell fumbled the ball
away four times.

The schedule makers are to be
thanked‘for making tomorrow‘s
away game with Belnit. Beloit
features the worst offense and
defense in the conference. But
Grinnell is going into the game
with a casualty list of note. Chip
Hall, the large delensive end, is out
for the season with pulled
ligaments in his leg and is
currently wearing a cast. Dennis
Walters got hit hard on his leg
Saturday and may not play
tomorrow. Mark Schultz played
the entire game with a broken nose
and is out for the season. Mark
Blanchard will also be unavailable
for duty tomorrow due to injury.

After Beloit Comes Ripon, which
is tied with Coe for the league lead.
They feature the league’s leading
scorer in the person ol Joe
Majeskl, who has eight touchdowns
this season. The Pioneers return
home Nov, 2 to face the University
of Chicago in a nonrconference
game.
