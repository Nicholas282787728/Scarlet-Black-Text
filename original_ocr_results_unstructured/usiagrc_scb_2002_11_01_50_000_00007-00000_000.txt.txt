Pets are an easy way fol‘sludenminlld RLCsim
make themselvu feel more at home. Th:y’r: more in-
teresting than plants and, for whatever reason, easier
to keep alive.

Something fishy here

The lines between plant and animal are blurred
in some cases. For example, Jon Wright '05 is the
proud owner ora Chia Boar. The pot was given to
Wright by his grandmother before he came to college
last year it remained locked away in its box until one
day when Wright and somc ofhrs
ﬂoornratos attempted to bring it
to life. Unfortunately, according
to Wright, “it didn't \vorkiaka.
[I] killed it."

wright does however own a
living. breathing Beta ﬁsh named
Alpha. According to Wright, Al-
pha got his name because
Wright's “the SA. in Dibble Annet and one of[hisi
first years is taking Greek and thought that since it
was a Beta fish it’d be tool to name it Alpha," and,
cool or not, the name stuck

Wright claims that he got Alpha thc Beta because
he “missed [his] roommates from lastycarso much."

Alpha has since hecomc a floor pet to some ex-
tent. Wright admitted that he doesn‘t even feed Ai-
pha, but that one ofhis noormates takes care ofthat
for him.

Puppy popularity

Jen Greene's new puppy, hobo.

Greene got Bobo about two weeks ago and states
that she has “boon getting so much attention thanks
to him "

Students drop by to play with Bobo. it
seems that rust abour everyone loves him.

Greene takes her pup to visit the
women in the Health Center, who
love him but, according to
Greene, elaim that “he has a

face that only a mother

could love!"

And love him she
does. Greene admits

that she bought Bobo almost on an impulse, burshe

He has learned to sit and is learning to let Greene
know when he needs to go out, Additionally hc's
learning skills such as how to lie down and avoid

Bobo is very animated and enjoys such games as
rug-ofrwar with onc's clothes, toys, camerasrraps, and
eats tails. speciﬁcally tho tail oiTommy, Greene's cat,
who roams rho halls oi Norris and often frequents
the surrounding dorms.

Tommy is not quire as impressed by Bobo's game,
but he seems to be doing a good rob of keeping the
little rykc in line. Tommy, who is easily twice Bobo’s
size, is rop.c.tt and intends to
stay that way.

In the nnoanrime, Tommy
will rust have to be thankful that
he's an established member ofthc
household and doesn't have to
worry about heing dressed up for
Halloween, as Crccnc would like
to do for Bobo.

And hobo will have to make sure he knows his
pleas and picks on someone his own size, such as his
best doggy pal, a certain Yorkshire terrier living in
the apartment oiRLc Don Weston.

When the cat’s away...

Earlier this semester, Lauren Page '05 gave sane»

“They thought they were going to get the Plague!"
explained Page. The reason being that this little
bundle of Bubonlc joy was a wild baby mouse.

it to live in a trash can in their room.

Nye told Page “she had to take care of it," and
while not entirely thrilled about the wild mouse in»

even admits, “He was cute."

Nye added, however, that she could hear the
mouse scratching around in the trash can while she
was working at her desk and even when she was in

Page rook care ofhcr new “per" as well as can be
expected. She shredded newspaper for the bottom of

"He could be somewhere in here." Page explained.
“He could be in the couch."

To this day, Buttons has not turned up. There was
a possible sighting by one of Pages floormates, but it
is not certain whether that sighting ovas Buttons or
