rt» Column a] pm Beauty.

Gather 'rollnd Grandpa Doric, lt-
tle ones, and get the lowdown on how
to conduct yourself in this here insti-
tution. First of all, brush up on the
smoking of your Murads et cetera,
for if you don't you're liable to ex-
pulsion. One poor little innocent girl
was sent home by the deans last
year, because she failed miserably in
her cigarette test. Imagine: She
Chose a Camel.

Another thing. Some students
prefer to walk while at Grinnell,
Other people just walk. ‘Ve ruth-
er think that some of the college
authorities have relatives in the
shoe business. Be that as it may,
if a college professor offers you a
ride in his Chevrolet, merely shrug
your elhows and give him the icy
stare. He is trying to entice
you, or what have you. He is
well aware of the penalty at
tached to motoring at Grinnell.
Beware, little ones, of the college
professor, with his shiny car and
his shiniel' trousers.

H, W. Motleck, chapel organist,
has lost two and three-quarters
pounds this summer. He will play
for the opening at the first chapel
service, the eighteen day diet song,
“You Are My Bang-boues Lover.”

Another tip. If you venture out
after 5:55, wear a large poster on
your back, saying something like
this: “League Board—Don‘t shoot.
It Isn‘t ten o’clock yet."

Wire-cutters and step-ladders
may he purchased at northshore
(Arbor Lake), or loop-district
hardware stores. Licenses for
same are obtainable at the back-
door of the Post Office.

Be very courteous to everyone
you meet on the campus. It may
he a professor. Don't play more
than a cent a point at any of the
freshman party games. The group
leader may be a Y. M. C. A. work—
er, and they work mighty fast
Directions ﬁor reaching Grinnell’s

theatres, (both of them); go one

and there you are.

Greetings to the class at 1938!
Dry your tears and remember that
it's scarcely nine weeks (63 days)
until Thanksgiving! Also be consol-

V Varsity Acquaints Preps

With Returning Studenls

The first varsity of the year. held
Friday evening in the women‘s gym
at eight o’clock, was devoted to get—
ting the freshmen acquainted. Dur-
ing the first part of the evening the
freshmen and upper classmen were
mixed up during the dances
under the superv on of Edward
Brown. master of ceremonies. Music
was furnished by a five piece orches—
tra, partly composed of Frank Fir-
bush, is member of PEtti's Cafeteria
orchestra, and a member of the old
Mississippi Six.

es

friendly tips on some of the intri»

catc details of going to college.

No doubt you have heard a great

deal about some of Grinnell’s tia-

dltions, (l. e. white dresses and no

Sunday ates), but 1 have my

doubts whether you’ve heard

about the really important ones—
fire-escapes, walks up the tracks,
and blanket parties.

According to rumors that have
been at large all summer, the first
two traditions nlimecl may he some-
what altered this season. In fact,
from all reports, it would he a nice
little problem as well as a great ser-
vice to the inmateso f the upper class
cottages, for you preps to figure out
some means of escape from those
cottages in case of fire. We predict
an increasing popularity of first
floor windows as a means of escape,
and we advocate the introduction of
the rope ladder. '

As for walks up the tracks,
some say that this form of exer»
cise will no longer ho necessary.
In other words, when your pro-
fessor announces that you have
flunked your mid-sem. exam, you
can be nonchalent and light a
Murad (not adv) without fouow-
ing the M. and St. I.. (by no means
adv.), Meal merchants declare
that the tiny sack, just large
enough for one package, is no
longer in vogue. However, car-
tons will still be wrapped free of
charge. "
Blanket parties and Grinnell :pic-

nics are practically synonymous, the
only difference heing that food is
sometimes taken on blanket parties.
But you will learn more of them
next spring. In the meantime, ask
your house-chairman. She will tell
you All.

With best wishes for your individv
uel and frequent appearance in this

r. s. The popular prep is he who
can eat the fastest. To delay a
table is to lose one to eight friends
at a single gulp.

Do not be frightened, girls,
should you hear a midnight prowl-
er in your roont It may he the

Applause in chapel encourages
the speaker and wakes up the aud-
ience. Thereiore it is undesir-
