believes ”ii fair job oi keeping
waste toa minimum" is being done
she would like to have new curtains
which would save energy and
would like to install windows which
could be opened to control the
temperature, '

ln Burling, Assistant Librarian
Steve Pandolfo is “not sure we
have any waste because the
heating and air conditioning
systems aren't poweriul enough to
do the job they are supposed to,"
The present cooling system is
around 20 years old and “tends to
break down a lot.” The cost of an
improved or new system ranges
from $25,000 to $133,000.

with respect to the gigantic
library windows, Pandolfo says, “I
don’t think the wlndoWS are very
energy ellicient" Although they
are double panes, the way they
were installed makes their in»
sulation value ”negligible."
However Pandolio wants to keep
the architectural integrity oi the
building intact no matter what and
opposes possible “architectural
abortion.”

viceProvost Ken Browning also
mentions that several "quick fix"
measures have been implemented
in campus stmctures to conserve
energy: thermostats have been set
back and are turned way down
during vacations and lower
wattage light bulbs are now being
used.

The school uses both natural gas
and oil supplied by lowa Southern
Utilities to heat and cool campus
buildings, Because Grinnell is a
low priority consumer the natural
gas supply is controlled by the
util' 'es company. “We are at their
mercy,” states Gerald Arment.
manager of mechanical equipment

at the physical plant. “They decide .

 

whedier we burn gas or oil.”
HOW MUCH DOES this waste

 

 

(3051.7 It is hard to assess the

:amount oi money that could be

saved if waste of heating fuel and
electricity were minimized.
Browning hopes to be able to look
into this matter later this year by
studying the energy savings in
renovated buildings. "One of the
biggest problems With waste is
knowing how much energy is used
in each place. Metering is hard to
come by in terms oi accurate in-
ioi~mation," he says.

Browning and Walker both cite
an overall laxness in energy
concerns over the past iew years
“We have clearly slipped away
irom the attitude we had when
energy was in short supply,"
Walker admits. According to
Walker a committee under
Browning's lead will do basic
research to find where major
energy losses are occurring.

Although solutions to the
i problems oi waste are being iound
,and implemented, obviously much
waste remains on the Grinnell
campus Browning states, “It is a
lmoral arid iinancial issue,” and
Walker comments, “We need to get
back on the tack as far as energy is
concerned , . . the cost of higher
education is going to pay- for
energy bills."

Computer addicts gather in Darby to do battle

two consecutive digits are in ad-
jacent squares.

Can you answer that question”! It
you can. then you should join Bruce
Albrecht, Newton White, Scott
Porter and Steve McKelvey in
trying your hand at computer
pmgramming.

On Saturday, October 28, start
ing at 10:15 am. the prideVof
Grinnell’s computer center took-on
19 other schools from the Midwest
to compete in the iiith annual ACM
North Central Regional Scholastic
Programming Contest. Ap-
proximately four to six people
from each school gathered in
Darby Gymnasium to duke it out
on the PDP llr70,

THE ATMOSPHERE was tense.
Eighty people huddled in groups at
tour around computer terminals,
typing as iast as they could It
looked somewhat like a secretarial
pool, except the participants
seemed like they would he more
comfortable at an MIT study break
than at a Kellv girl coffee break.

Some people may express horrox
at the thought of a whole room lul of
computer addicts. As Newton
White says, computer jocks are
commonly stereotyped as having
“white socks, high water pants,
short hair, buck teeth and
glasses.” However, he adds, ”Most
people fall somewhat short of this
ideaablessedly.”

 

You may ask, how does one win
at something - like this? The

scoring, 1 am» told. is easy. First oi

all. there are four questions to
answer which were made up by
John Vogel and Henry Walker
from Grinnell and Ken Magle from
University of Missourerolla,

TO ANSWER one of these
questions the team programs the

~computer in a non-judgedru

Then, if they think that their
program is correct, they submit it
as a judged run For each non»
judged run the team receives ten
points and 25 points ior each
judged run.

The time it takes to answer one

scores are added together. The
object of the contest is to answer
the most questions in the least time
with the least amount oi points.
ON THE SECOND problem, for
instance. Washington Univeisity
got off to a last start, iinishing at
10:58 am. Grinnell finished at
11230, 75 minutes after the starting
time, They had two non-judged

Whewl Sound complicated?
Well. it isn’t exactly a spectator
sport. but everyone there seemed
to be enjoying what they were
doing. The Grinnell team did very
well; it came in second only to

Washington University Third
place went to die University oi
Nebraska-Lincoln. and fourth to
Drake University.
