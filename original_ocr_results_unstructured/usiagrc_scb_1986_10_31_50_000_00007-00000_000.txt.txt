Reader Frulstrated

Dear Editor,“ .

I was saddened and more than a little
trustrated this week after reading the cone
tinuing “View From The Top" column by
our S.G.A. president Ted Amann. It made
me wonder if the man who is supposed to
represent our student body has nothing
better to do than insult us with his abusive
language. I think it has become obvious
irom the reply letters in the last two
weeks' editions [If the S and B that Ted has
made more than a tew people here at Grin-
nell a little angry with his ridiculous
remarks and questions. I wouldn’t dare
call myself a “typical male" and I don’t
think I need to comment on the question
that has already been addressed. and ad
mirably, I must say.

The question at hand is whether we must
put up with blatant insults. The question
here is sensitiVity Perhaps. Ted, you do
enjoy creating controversial questions, but
let’s keep it at a level above personal in»
fights. Perhaps it is better to send insults
through the mail, that way we don’t all
have to become involved. and that way,
Ted Won't be wasting half of his column
telling someone that he or she acts “as if
God had stuck a bottle up their butt.”
Come on, this newspaper is strivmg tor
quality. remember? Let's start thinking
about the people who have to read this
stufi. You represent us all, not just the
typical male, whoever he might be. Why
don't we see some material that addresses
us all? e Dong Bechtel. '39
