Are Drinking Habits AffeCied?

by Kyle Schaub

Harmonizing itself with the incr-
easing number of states who recog-
nize l8-year—olds as adults, Iowa
has decided to lower its legal drink-
ing age to 18 on July 1.

Last July, the state’s lovyear-old
drinking law went into effect, which
most underclassmen at the College
noted last August when school recone
vened. Managers of the local es-
tablishments who have sold alcohol
for many years were asked about
the effects the new 19-yearrold
law had had, and were also asked
to comment on any additional etc
lects the upcoming 18—year law
might have.

The managers were also ques-
tioned about a bill now pending
in the Legislature to allow the sale
of liquor on sunday. Although the
amendment originally reserved the
privilege for establishments .that
received over 50% of their pro-
fits from nonralcoholic sales, Po-
lice Chief Bill Peters stated that
all places Will have that option,
including bars, taverns and rose
taurants. It passed by the Legis-
lature, this bill would also become
law July 1,

Peters has seen little effect in the
area of drunken driving arrests,
with most of last year's young of-
lenders arrested before the July
1 law became effective. He claims,
“Proportionately, the ie-ZO-year»
olds are no more trouble than any
one else” One-fifth of those ar»
rested for drunk drivmg last year
were 19 or 20.

Arrests for possession of alco-
hol has markedly decreased. Pre-
viously Peters reported that he us-
ually arrested between 55—60 minors
for possession, although he “never
did arrest many College kids.” Last
year he arrested only 28, again
most before the July 1 changeover.

Peters is more hesitant about his
feelings concerning the new law
for 18—year-olds. He feels the new
legal age “might have some probe
lems." He is worried about the
connection at the high school level
where incidents might occur at teen
dances.

Taverns which were interviewed
include Russ' at 7Zl»4th Avenue
and Duffy’s at 829 Main. Mr. Russ
Otcheck, the owner/manager of
Russ’ Tavern and Recreation Parlor
for 31 years, has noticiedlncreased
business but no increased rowdie
ness. In tact,-he feels “most young
guys are real decent," He has also
noticied lower minors trying to get
served, “just two or three now,”

Staying open on Sunday does not
appeal to Otcheck. He iirmly sta~
ted, ”Six days a week is plenty,
Small places just wouldn’t be inc
terested.”

Duffy’s owner/manager, Leroyloe
hnson, has run his tavern since he
bought it 14 years ago When 19-
year—olds became legal, he noticed
“a few more collegekidsthis year."
However, not much has changed, eits
her in sales volume or rowdiness in
general.

Johnson agrees with Otcheck about
not wanting to operate on Sundays,
His reasons were that “I’ve got
enough licenses now, and help is
hard to get. I Just don’t want it."

Restaurants in town who have also
served alcoholic beverages for a
number at years were asked the
same questions concerning the ef-
fects in their establishments.

The liquor volume sold at the
Longhorn has increased since last

year, according to owner/manager
Tom Parmley. However, he added
that since he bought the business
at 1011 Main eight years ago, “the
volume has increased every year
I’ve been here." He also mentioned
that 80% of the Longhorn's business
is in food, not in liquor sales which
mostly occur after the dininghours,

Rowdiness has affected the
“Horn,” but Parmley feels “it has
toned down. The first three or four
months were the worst.” However,
he noticied that he “still has noisy
nights,” but no so frequently.

Parmley agrees with Chief Peters
about "not being crazy about the
13—yeareold law" and that he “can
see some problems." However, he
forsees less change compared to
the effect the lSryear-old law at
last July had.

Competition will probably force
the Longhorn into operating lull
time on Sundays, although Parmley
is not certain. He believes the ch-
ange will “stretch me thin for the
seventh day,” and emphasized the
problem of linding good cooks.

Mr. Carrol Hammond. the manager
of Wayne's Steak House at 191
Main, indicated little change in his
establishment since July, and could

the sale of beer on Sundays.

Some of McNully's largest prob
lems have been with the time limit
outeolis when liquor can be sold,
Groth is looking forward to the
day when no restrictions will he
placed on liquor sale hours, much
less days.

Hy-Vee, at looesth Avenue, cannot
make such independent decisions
about the sale of liquor on Sundays.
Larry McVey, the manager oi the
3-year-old establishment, declared
th t the matter was a company dec
ci on and “strictly up to them."

He also has noticed only a small
increase in sales volume, stating it
was "hard to say” but he did not
think that liquor sales were “any
more than normal." The remaining
source of liquor in town, the lowa
State Liquor Store, could not Come
merit directly about its sales vole
ume or luiure Sunday practices.
According to the manager, Raymond
Playle, the information can only be
released from the director of the
lowa Beer and Liquor Control. Gor-
dan Gallager,

Playle explained further that this
condition was a rule set by the
Control to protect the release of
incorrect information and to keep

forsee none when the lb-year-olds
became legal customers. In his ten
years as manager, Hammond could
see no change in sales volume, the
cidents of rowdiness or problems
with minors. He did predict that he
would begin operating on Sundays it
the proposed amendment should be-
come law.

J.D.'s at 922-1/2 Main was less
certain about serving alcohol on
Sunday. Robert Globus, the Owner/
manager now ior eleven years,sim-
ply stated that “I have no idea a—
bout Sunday.” In addition, he has
observed no new effects in his es-
tablishment from 19—year-olds, nor
does he expect any change with the
lB—yearmlds.

Another source of alcohol in town
are the grocery stores that sell beer.
McNally’s, which has been incor—
porated since 1903 at 1021 Main,
sees no difference in sales. Virgil
Groth, one of the store's owners,
stated, “The lBVZU-year-olds were
getting the beer anyway. Now they
are ]ust buying it themselves.”
Problems with minors trying to
buy beer will be helped by the
new ioryear-old law, according to
Groth. “We still will ask for an
l.D, all the time, but now we’ll
know anyone train the College will
be 0.K,"

Groth also sees selling beer on
Sundays as a convenience for every-
one, replying with a ”why not?”
to the Sunday sales question, He sees
the present law as silly to prevent

Appointments Announced

Appointment of two more laculty
members has been announced by
the College. -

Hanno Hardt, an associate prolese
sor of communications at the Unis
versity of Iowa, will serve Grinnell
as visiting lecturer in communica-
tions.

or. Hardt has a wide background
in the field ofinternational commun-
ications, and has written many arti-
C125 on various facets Of mass com-
munications.

He speaks four languages, and
travels regularly each year in Wes-
tern Europe.

Richard Dale Van Scatter has been
named associate professor in the

Department of Education. Van Scot-
ter comes to Grinnell from the Uni-
versity of Colorado, where he has
held a similar position for the past
two years.

Van Scotter has written a number
of articles dealing with the teach-
ing of social studies.

Nominations for the all-cam—
pus judicial council have been
reopened. Interested persons
should apply through the SGA
mailbox by 5:00 pm. Friday,

the responsibility for release onthe
State Control level. P1ayle emphae
sized that Gallager “will cooper-
ate" and usually releases such inc
formation when requested by mail
or in person.

In conclusion, it appears that the
main effect the liquor changes have
had on establishments in Grinnell
depend on their respective populare
ity with students. If the establish
ment is not heavily student»frequen-
ted, little change has been observed
and is likely not to change when the
lB-vear-olds also become legal this
summer. There is concern over
alcohol now entering the high sch-
Ool years, but most have adopted
a “waibandssee” attitude.

The Sunday liquor law, uncertain as
it now stands, has met with various
reactions. The small taverns do not
want to change their present hours,
whereas the restaurants will prob
ably exercise the new options. Wore
ries about hiring adequate help and
the seven—day week Will have to be
overcome in the name of competie
tion.

J-B

Major Concerts will receive the
built of this increase, from $17,500
this year to $21,000 next year Sm-
all Concerts and Movies also recei-
ved significant increases,

The Son presented a new linan.
cial arrangement in whichSGA wou-
ld contract with the SliB to produce
a certain number of issues at a
given subscription rate. This will
insure the independence of the 5543
from political pressure which may
come from the JrB, The proposal
was approved, contracting for 30
issues next year at the rate of
35,20 per student, SGA will con-
tinue to pay this amount for all
Students out of the activity fund
which it receives.

The final action on the budget
was approval of the total $63,014
amount. This leaves a reserve of
approximately $1700, calculated
on a base of 1230 students per sem-
ester.

Main/Residents View Pub

by Toby Wosk

Main Pit, lamuus home of Foreign
Food Fairs, Seders, Digger Dinners,
midnight rendezvous and candy-she
eaking will add a new member to
its roster of exicitingactivities next
year: the Controversial Grinnell
College Pub. The go-signal for the
pub was handed down only recently,
after room draw

Few oi next year’s Main residents
were really upein-arnis about the
decision. “As long as it daesn’t
get too rowdy, i guess it'll be OK,”
said Karen Penico. Lodged upon the
lourth floor, she noted, she needn't
really worry, especially considering
that the elevator is now defunct.

Chris McKusker, in more vulner»
able spot on Main iirst, was not
disturbed by the decision, “Thefact
that we knew that the meal lines
are going to be right outside our
door shows that we know whatwe’re
getting into in terms at noise. We

don’t spend much time in our room
anyway,"

Another aspect of the Situation was
pointed out by Ellen Grady, who was
“pretty angry" to find out about the
decision after she had already drawn
into Main. “Main doesn't reallyhave
a lounge at its own, so many people
have been using Gardner to study
in.”

Gregg Golden was not in favor
of the pub from the start. "The
problems ol Main are notgoingto be
much greater than the problems in—
flicted on the community at large,”
he said, As chief of the Used Book
Store he has additional qualms, l'e-
aring for the safety of the store’s
window and contents.

But one future Mainian who rests
entirely easy about the pub is Steve
Backstrom, who claims no tears
whatsoever. "1 plan to spend quite
a bit of time there,” he explained.

EPC: 'Notliing Exciting’

by Scott Well

The Sub-Committee on Educational Policy struggled through a thick
agenda yesterday afternoon without doing anything which could be des-

cribed “innovative or exciting."

A motion to reconsider the issue concerned with the credit hour limita»
lion ior practica was made by Scott Weil and deteated by a vote of 2-6»0.
Earlier in the meeting, Dean Walker announced that the number of inde-
pendent proiects which faculty members may supervise, both two credit
and four credit varieties, will be limited to seven. Thus the maximum
number of independent hours a faculty member is allowed to grant is
21;. This rule does not apply to group independents. Dean Hamilton re-
ported to the sub-Committee on the organizational planning for the deve-
lopment of the Pre-Freshman Year Orientation Program to be held prior

to the fall semester, 1973.

One very important item which shall be on the agenda for next week’s
meeting is a proposal from Mark Willcher for a "4-14! Interim Session
at Grinnell College.” This proposal represents a very substantial calendar
and curricular change. Mr. Willcher hopes that the interim program will
allow the College to offer many more courses, increase opportunities
lor independent study and perhaps even reduce class size. The interim
session is particularly advantageous to students who wish to spend a month
doing intensive research in some area, such as biological field work,
archaeological excavations or overseas studies, as well as on campus

programs.

The “4-1-4" calendar is now in operation at 236 colleges in the us,
including St, Olaf, Oberlin, and Macalester, Mr. Willcher offers six
variations on his theme, one of which would offer encampus seminars
and classes with a limited number of faculty, under whom independent
study can also be conducted. Theimplementationofsuch a program largely
depends upon the amount of student input and interest. n11 concerned
students should contact Scott Well or Len Kurz before next Thursday.
Mr. Willcher is to be commended lor his initiative

create another, countervailing, ine
stitution to replace the free market
mechanism and get Negroes into
main stream America. So the lib
erals passed laws forcing racists
to sell houses to Negroes (who cou-
ldn’t afford them) give jobs to Ne-
groes (who weren’t trained for th—
in) and so forth,

These Symbolic changes fired the
hopes of Negroes but proved illu-
sory, So there came upon the land
a "new” answer; Black Power. Rat-
her than have Negroes think otthemr
selves as individuals, and try to
make it on their own, Blacks would
think of themselves as members
at a group Thus there was the mo»
vement to trace ancestral lineage
(back to Africa), demands for racial
quotas, etc And Blacks became rag
clally conscious. But it didn’t end
With Blacks, rather this new con»
ciousness spread to whites, and the
racists came out of the walls. Ens
couraged by Black claims that they
were a group and could rise and

/

fall as such, white racists have the
ammunition to whip up old and new
fires.

Black racial conciousness was and
l5 a mistake, It is based on a rac—
ist notion that Blacks are different
than Whites and can only lead to the
hatred and bloodshed of other racial
movements Blacks have only the ex—
perience of White discrimination in
common.

it was originally supposed, in the
great tradition of lighting fire with
fire, that since “whites" thought of
Negroes as a group and judgedthem
as such, then the solution would be
to become a “solid” group and
this way get into the system. But
racial conciousness cannot be deSr
troyed by more racial concinusness.

Lastly there was the social argu-
ment that Negroes ought to quit
acting “white” and be Black Hen-
ce: Black is Beautiful, But this was

no more than a subtle contusion.
For 2i Negro to try to make him-

self appear as “White” as possis

ble is absurd and racist.
To be continued. . . .
