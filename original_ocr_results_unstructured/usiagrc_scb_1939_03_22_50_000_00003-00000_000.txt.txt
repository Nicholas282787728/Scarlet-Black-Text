‘Siop - Hitler’
Move Restraint

To Aggression
——By R.E.M,

“And for that declaration (that
England would resist to the lut-
most any challenge by the dicta-
tors), I am convinced that 1 have
not merely the support, sympathy,
the confidence ot my fellow coun-
trymen and countrywoiuen, but I
shall have also the approval of
the whole British empire and of
all the other nations who value
peace indeed, but who value free-
dom even more."

That very significant state-
rncnt msrhcd the end of an ad—
dress given by Prime Mini er
Chamberlain of Great Britain
last Friday night For the first
time, Chamberlain, speaking to
all intents and purposes for the
peaceful nations of Europe, has
taken violent exception to the
actions of Chancellor Adolf Hit-
ler, and now shows some signs
of resisting further the unhar-
ranted aggression on the put
of the fuehrer.

Why has this move on the part
of the Hitler regime aroused so
much reaction in Europe, while

formerly the other nations were
content to stay on the sidelines
and watch the lion devour the
lamb? It is because this time the
German coup has completely dis»
regarded even the principles which
the German government had os-
tensibiy followed.

Formerly, there might have
been some case hiiilt up as to
the necessity of liberating the
German peoples in the coun-
tries surrounding Germany, due
to the situation created by the
Versailles treatyr This time,
however the Germans in Czecho-
Slovakia had already been lib-
el-Med; Hitler had even declared
outright that, “We don't. want
Czechs in the Reich!" He went
on at the some time to say that
he had no more territo ial ani-
bitlons in Europe!

These pledges were broken, and
for the first time Hitler has real-
ly hccoine no more than a Na
poleonic conqueror, whose con-
quest now needs no justification
other than the conquest itself.
Such action, inevitably, has

brought counteraction among the
countries of Europe, especially
after the written contract drawn
up at Munich has been deliberate-
ly broken. The principles and
honor ot the major countries of
Europe are now at stake.

The immediate result has
been an aligning of powers, led
by England and Russia in a
“stop Hitler" movement, and
England has demanded immed-
iate action to pmxent any
inrther surprise aggression on
Hitler‘s part. The main weak»
ness ot such an alliance is th .
Because France and Great Bn»
tain are so remote from the
Balkan area, any effective re—
sistance this bloc could make
to further aggression in that
area would have to come maim

able to not tact, but the mobs
ilizing speed of the Russian ar—
my is extremely doubtful, For
that reason, it would seem that
such a grouping ot powers,
while it sounds good on paper,
will not be especially effective
in practice.

Even though Hitler realizes the
weakness of the idea which the
powers are considering, there is
no doubt that the mere fact ot
the reaction wrll have some in—
fluence in restraining him irom
too drastic action in the future.
How much influence is still un-
knoivn, but doubtless we will
know in the near future.

Late breakfasts in the men’s dor-

The meal, which is served from
5:20 to 3:40 am. each morning,
Monday through Friday, received
a favorable vote among the dor-
mitory residents recently when the
Council of House Presidents sub-
mitted the plan to them.

“While the present plan is only
temporary and will be dlsconLin»
ued o the spring recess, the
possib es that it will be used
next year depend largely upon the
support and cooperation that it
receives during the trial period."
Jack H. Harris, president of the
Council of House Presidents, said
today.

“The waiters and kitchen help
have cooperated to the fullest ex-
