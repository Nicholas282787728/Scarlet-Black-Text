“We are not a joke organizauon

by Julie Slivinsky
Last Saturday. many people put

7 on bizarre costumes. went trick-0r-

treating, and held parties to
celebrate Halloween, Some
students, however. chose to mark
the occasion diiierently Members
oi the Grinnell College Pagan
Coven tGC P.C.l sacriiiced a
pumpkin

"We had a storm ritual. The
weather was pertect. We sacriﬁce
ed a pumpkin and ottered it to the
Goddess and the Earth," said
treshrnan Glen Brown. one at the
tounders oi the G.C.P C The
ceremony, which used the cement
eiiigy on the edge oi Mac iield as
an altar, was orchestrated by two
priestesses, ireshinen Heather
Jeanne Pyle and Betsy Bradner.

The G C.P.C .or “the Coven," is
a new religious organization on
campus that otters an alternative
to Christian Fellowship or chain!-

zim, "Basically. on the one hand
we’re just a sort otstudy group. We
get together and read and ask
questions. We believe in the Gods
dess. the concept that God is a
uoman. We also use the Ouija
board and Tarot cards. explained
Brown. Said ireshman Mark Hill,
another founder oi the group, "It‘s
about trying to become spiritually
more aware oi yourseli and learn
ing more about yourself" Pyle,
the third rounder or the group. add.
ed, "We look tor spirituality
through more vague terms, like
tinding God in yourseli and all
around." The Coven does not have
any speciiic doctrine because, said
Brown, “right now you could say
we're all shopping ior God.”
According to Brown, “a pagan
coven is the basic unit that pagans
get together in, like a Christian
parish." He estimated Grinnell‘s
coven to number between 20 and on

members.

Technically a pagan religion is
any pie-Christian European
rellglon. but the word carries
other, more threatening connotes
tions lor some people “Pagan is
just a good word because people
get really interested. But we do
have to remind people that we
don't worship idols." commented
Brown. llill remarked that “a lot oi
people have themisconception that
we worship devils "

Overall. Hill. Brown. and Pyle
agreed that response to the Coven
has been good. "People have said
everything under the sun or the
moon,” said Hill. "Only one person
has totally condemned us. We have
friends who joke about it. and then
there's the people who are
bothered that we're allowed to he
in the Memo. But the majority
have been very positive and in
terested in what we're doing It

The many forms of
racism at Grinnell

by Debbie Chase

Many people. not just those on
the Speakeasy panel, likewise
believe that racism has prevailed
on Grinnell’s campus, and they
have detinite opinions and percep
tions or it.

Kesho Scott, visiting instructor
in American studies, deiines
racism at Grinnell as institu-
tionalized ”In an academic setting
that has a iberal edge to it, people
make assumptions that it could not
be here, Racism occurs in the term
oi misconceptions when institu-
tions do not include nonswhlte peo
ple in academic learning," she
said

“It is also misinlormation that
black taculty would only bc ior
black people. They're here ior all
to broaden their experience
Racism hurts everyone. not iust

blacks All students' interest must
be in academic and consciousness»
raising areas. It can't. be just black
people raising consciousness," she
said.

Scott praised Grinnell students
tor their interest and large turnout
at the Speakeasy. She also come
nicnted that Grinncll administrcs
tion is well aware that they have
problems with recruitment oi
block iaculti and with student
retention,

Outside oi the Speakeasy, many
black students expressed concern
and irustration about racism at
Grinnell. Chris Holliiis said that
with almost one third oi the people
he meets. he ieels an underlying
tension that discourages him irom
torining a iriendship.

Racism is harder to discern

Coulter, “How do you conl‘ront
something when you‘re not oul‘e,
on the surtace, that it's there?"

“When 1 came to Gl’tnncll. l took ,

it at iace value,” said Saiiiantha
Massingale. “I took their
literature to heart about diversity.
Then I iound out what it was really
like. and the reality u as very hard
to deal ,wlth."

Students such as Massingale

became so disgusted that they telt ;

they had to act, Feeling that the
meeting with trustees last year
was not enough. they began to ex
plore ne\\ ways oi approaching
overt and covert racism When a
letter by two white students was
published in the Scarlet and Black

in response to an editorial about ‘

the omission oi an identilying plats
que for the Black Cultural Center.
black students ielt compelled to
act and so arranged the
Speakeasy. according to Mass-
ingale.

These eriorts

awareness seem to have been

achieved through the Speakeasy. ‘

tor many white students gained a
new perspective on racism at Grin-
ncll. "It was very powcrrul. and it
made me realize that i don't know
what it's like to be black." said

The G.CPC,'s plans tor the

to get more than just PDRs We d
like to get real meetings." in

rituals Hill urged people to cone
