Scarlet or Black i Friday. November 1, 1996

To the Campus Community,

We. the members of Astan Students in
Alliance, are responding to the advertisement
in the Gum that was distributed on October
15. Concerned individuals demanded an
apology from the editors of the Gum, Dan
Buettner and Marcus Moran. However, ASIA
feels the apologies through c-mail and in thc
R'esponse on Thursday, October 17, were
inadequate. The editors clearly did not un-
derstand the racist implications of the ad.
They apologized for OUR misinterpretation
rather than apologizmg for the blatant conv
tent ofthe ad.

This ad is racist because the use of the
acronym of ASIA and a photo of ASIAs
“demonstration celebration" in theSpn‘ng of
1996 which bclittled our group and our is
sues. Racism is RACE PREJUDICE +
POWER. The editors abused the power of
the press to mock ASIA’s causes as “ludir
crous" and “asininc.” Our issues are cons
nected to issues of race, thus the ad has trer
mendous racist Implications. This ad is a
manifestation of how institutional racism is
seen as harmless and acceptable on this cam-
pus. in this society, and in history.

Many claim that harm was not intended,
and therefore the ad is not racist. You do not
have to be AWARE that you are racist to be
racist. You do not have to INTEND to per-
form racist acts to be racist Racism is your
AFFIRMATION. your iNDIFFERENCE.
and your BILINDNESS to the harm that we
feel on this campus. You have the power to
be blind to your own racism and to deny that
you are racist,

We demand the immediate resrgnations of
Dan Buettner and Marcus Moran from the
editorship ofthc GUM for theirobvious lack
of respect and responsibility, ,

The Grinnell College Academic Catalog
states that “the Colleges ultimate goal is to
educate citizens and leaders for our republic
and the world beyond our borders" (Acar
demic Catalog 199571997, p. i). in light of
this goal, we once again repeat ourdemands
to the institution ofGrinnell College for culr
tural space, a curriculum representative of
the diversity of the student body, more face
ulty of color and a more comfortable cams
pus climate for all students.

To the Grinnell College community,

As coordinator of factory farniingl
agribusiness concerns for Students in Defense
of Animals and the Environment (SDAE), I'd
like to take a moment to respond both to the
criticism by certain Grinnellians of our recent
National Vegetarian Day event. and to the gene
eral negativity that our group has met with in

response to our campaigns over the course of'

the past year. Please forgive me ifthis is a little
long-Willded; my hope is that by clarifying
some things now. I’ll save myself and my fol-
low activists a little time and a lot ofS&B spacc
in the weeks and months to come,

As far as the National Vegetarian Day event
is concerned. It’s difﬁcult for me to respond to
a lot of the concerns that I think people had,
since our email account received a grand total
of two letters in response to it, neither of which
was more than mildly critical. I will, however.
respond brieﬂy to Rachale Green‘s letter to the
editor printed in the last issue of the 5&8 be
fore break. I take issue with Ms Green's im-
plication that SDAE members
“lack,“knowledgeabouttheirchoiceho go veg-
etarian)". 0n the contrary,1 think it’s likely that
we are among the students at Grinnell most
aware of and concerned with the ethical, envir
ronmental and healm-related aspects ofdiet and
lifestyle. One of our foremost goals as animal
rights and environmental actiVlsts is the edu-
cation of others as to the consequences of eat-
ing animal products. If our commitment to this
goal hasn't been readily apparent in our cam-
paigns thus far, I’m surprised and will do my
utmost to ensure that it is in the future, Ms.
Green also criticizes SDAE for what she sees
as a lack of compassion on our part for those
who cannot afford, because of poverty, limited
resources. etc., to pick and choose what they
will and won’t eat. I think everyone in our group
realizes that there are people on earth who must
eat meat in order to survive (Eskimos.
Bedouins, Lapps, etc); the focus of our cams
paigns, however, is on ﬁrstrworld nations, par
ticularly the United States, since we consider
them to be the biggest offenders. Also, having
grown up in a third-world nation, I can vouch
for the fact that most people living at or below
the poverty line are not the ones buying the meat
- they simply can not afford it. A vegetarian
diet is therefore both practical and necessary.

One of the complaints I hear most oft in
response to SDAE campaigns such as National

7

 

Vegcmnan Day is that we approach issues from, i
an ethical standpoint Yes, wt: do We also ap-
proach them from environmental and health-
related standpoiiits, and occasionally from
feminist and Marxist perspectives. The fact that
our displays, the rcccnt sidewalkrclialking be.
ing a good example, present ii number of dir-
fcrent arguments for vegetarianism and other
aspects Ofcrucltyrfrec living is reflective oftlic
diversity ofopinions and approaches that char-
acterizes the animal rights and environmental
movements all large, Since SDAE strives to bc
all-inclustvc and to consider a full range ofanl-
mal-rclatcdconccms. we do not limitourselves
to a single philosophy We attempt to incorpor
rate the various views of our members, and it
is only fair and natural that our campaiu

iieci the opinions and approaches ofthosc who
devoted their time and effort to planning them.
If someonc feels that “meat is murder" might
be an cffoctiveslogan, we're willing to Lry ii; if
we get the impression that it's really alienating
people, we'll drop it, but not because we don‘t
agree with the premise. We‘ve tried a lot ofdif-
fercnt tactics, and the sad truili is that we sima
ply cannot satisfy everyone. Even when we just
stick to straightforward statistics, we get lets
ters from people accusrng us ol'llaving made
them up.

The bottom line is , we are animal rights
and environmental activists, and to expect us
to stop fighting what we consider to be ilijuSr
lice on the grounds that we might inadvertently
offend someone isjust not reasonable.

In conclusion (finally, eh?) I urge anyone
who has a problem with oilr organization or
our campaigns to contact us directly, Vax us at
(SDAE), or come to a meetliig and share your
concerns, If you want references for statistics
and quotes, or additional information on any
issue, we'll be more than happy to pass that
along to you. We meet every Wednesday

discussions about race and l'ZlClSl“ to spcak
to the general climate and dialogue that has
developed at the college over the past few
years As lticulty members. we have
struggled with how to express our concerns,
given that any CXPIC>\l()lt on our part may
be construed as an assertion ufauthnrny rivcr
stutlcnt govcinancc Yet as thl‘nhCﬂ ofthc
Grinncll community. wc also feel a strong
need to enter into the broader discussion of
llicsc issues While the Gun: satire and the
reactions that it provoked belong to the arena
of student life and discoursc. this arena is
incxtncably linked to curricular ixsucs, What
wc do in our classrooms affects the broader
life of the community, which in turn enters
into the climate and discussions of our class-
iooms. We hear increasingly from students
who l'ccl silenced on this campus: from stu-
dents of color who call attention to a lack of
understanding ollhcir experience and to their
desire not to be solely rcsponslble for crealr
ing such understanding. We also hear from
students who feel silciiccd both iii and out of
the classroom. afraid that they will be called
racist if they engage honestly in open dis
cussions about race. We write, then, to mils
dress the broader concerns of which this lair
est incident is only a small part,

The task of forming a community whose
IlCllOlIS are based on understanding and rc»
spect involves all of us; as educators, we
work particularly With those issues that are
curricular in nature We scc as one of our
primary tasks that of enabling students to
understand the complexities ofexpericnce in
a multicultural society and to develop the
ability to fully assume the responsibilities
implied in the exercise of free speech. To
that end, We see the following curricular
goals as crucial to our teaching efforts. We
also are still leaniing how to incorporate them
into our teaching:

- to provrdc greater opportunities for
learning about how race is embedded in sys»

tcmsofcultural knowledge and institutional
structures in ways that allow many of us to
act unconsciously out ot racism or race perir
loge.

- to study texts critically, understand-
ing tliai messages are constructcd not only
by an author's intentions but also by the
south-historical context in which they are
written and read, and thus a text may cons
vey messages whose cllect can be unintcnr
tionally damaging.

. to lake on the responsibility that
comes with using language to construct
knowledge about oneself, onc’s own com-
munity and cspccially about those one per-
ceives as dlllercnl.

- to rccognizc that thc power ofa domi-
nant group is constituted in the language of
“otherness” or “difference" and that unpack»
ing this language is cnicial to breaking down
the sense of otherness that we hold,

- to enable each of us to come to an
empathetic understanding ofthc experiences
oi‘thosc We have thought ofas “different" to
the greatest extent posSiblc.

There are already curricular-based orga-
nilalions dedicated to these goals. The
MultisIntciculturul Curriculum Development
Committee as well as the GWS and Afro-
American Studies concentrations are work
ing to increase efforts to address these goals
in the curriculum by provrding support for
faculty and course development Without
believing that Orlnncll will be entirely rid of
racism in the near future, our wish is to work
towards a community in which connections
are made in the humanity we all experience,
not merely by tolerating difference, but rather
by seeking to build understanding and respect
through which differences come to enrich our
community rather than to divide us.

Dear Editor and College community:

The week before break we were all wit-
ness to something that ended up ugly and
heavy with implications. Though time has
passed and surely tempers have calmed, i
still cannot pass up the opportunity to
speak about this incident; I believe that all
voices should be heard, even (as often hap»,
pens on this Campus, I’ve learned) if those
voices are not heeded.

The Weekend of the 11th, I, like every
one else. grabbed a copy of the Gum from
the box in the post office, and I smiled as I
ﬂipped through it. I still haven't had a
chance to read every anicle in it, but a brief
glance at things inside indicated to me that
this Gum was probably the funniest I've
seen at Grinnell (and I have been here
longer than my class year implies). Itook
the ASIA. thing in stride. I've been in a
number of student groups on campus and
am in fact a chairperson of one this year,
so I could appreciate the humor that the
writers and/or editors were trying to con-
vey. It did momentarily strike me that they
used an acronym that was already in use
on campus, but I still thought it was a le-
gitimale piece of satire that others would
also find entertaining,

Apparently I was wrong, as ASIA and
other people and groups found fault with
the piece. When I walked into the post
office the next day and found the sheet
hanging there With the page ripped out of
the magazine with the word racist scrawled
on it in large orange letters, I was stunned.
Yes, stunned. I had to question myselfl-iow
I could find something funny that obvi-
ously was, to some, racist. The more I
thought about it and analyzed it myself.
however, 1 found no fault in the piece, no
real reason why anyone would term it rac»
ist except to get a me out of people who
don’t analyze things for themselves, I
looked at it from every perspective that I
could see, and still I found only a short
satirical piece that perhaps pushed the en,
vclopc but definitely did not espouse race
ist views.

We all know whatevenls transpired im»
mediately following this: the letters in the
loggias, the meeting at the Forum, talks in
some classes here and there, What I want
to address in this lettcr arc a few points
that I think a large number of people on

this campus are overlooking. First. let’s
look at the “ramsm” found in the piece.

As much as I would have liked to have '

sided With ASIA and other groups about
this point, I found that I couldn’t. Noth-
ing in that piece was racist in any way. No-
where in it did it say that Asian-Americans,
or any other person of color for that mat-
ter, were lesser than others in society. No
where did the article purport that one seg
ment of the ethnic population was substanr
dard. The writers in no way stated that
ASIA was of lower class. The article was
not written from a bigoted standpoint; it

was written to poke fun. And the fun it ,

poked was not targeted to a specific grOUp;
it was targeted to actionr that many groups
on campus take. Keep in mind that the
anicle also made mention of SDAE's ac
tions, something a lot of people conve»
niently ignored during the storm ofthe de-
bate. In my opinion. to take something like
this article and twtst it to make it a racist
issue is absurd, Yes, the article had mo-
ments of ambiguity. But I did not think
that the meaning was that unclear.

Secondly,Ifearforthe ramifications this
incident will have on this campus for years
to come. Yes, I think that ASIA overrer
acted. but that‘s my opinion. Beyond that,
I have concerns about the state ofcampus
after the conﬂict here. How long will it be
before anyone, not just a publication, den
cides to satirize a group on campus? I be
lievc it will be a very long time. People
here have been frightened sufficiently now
that even “acceptable” parody of groups
will disappear. I think, for a long while
This disturbs me, because such behavior
is tantamount to censorship. I find it at
best misguided, and at worst hypocritical,
of a campus community that prides itself
on its broadminded views and acceptance
of unpopular voices to abruptly silcncc
anyone, especially if some miscommuni»
cation or misunderstandings surround a
particular controversy.

Thirdly. I’d like to express my disap—
pointment with the campus community for
handling the situation in thc manncrthat it
did, First of all. racist is a word that is
heavy and loaded with meaning. It is not
a word to either misuse or blithely toss
around. It requires care in its use. As a
person of color myself, I understand the
significance of this word and its consc-

qucnces, I don‘t advocate people using it
except in situations where it must apply.
Also, I will reiterate that, yes, I believe that
people ovei-rcacted. I do think thatASlA,
who felt singled out, had the right to ask
for an apology, which rm sure the editors
of the Gum would have given. But yells
and screams never accomplish anything,
at least not in a constructive way. People
don’t learn when you scream at them; they
become defensive and, more importantly,
stop listening. We need to take the time to
be civil and to try to educate people. ins
stead ofsimply scapegoating them or shun—
ning them out ofhand. People learn when
you speak to them in acalm way. You have
to ask yourself, “Do I want my needs in
stantly met, or do I want to have everyone
try to understand, so that all sides respect
each other?" The desire for immediate
gratification is rampant everywhere. and
even here, apparently. Nothing has been
solved, in my opinion, it has just been
pushed far to the side.

To those who adamantly feel that the
anicle was racist, did it make a difference
when Dan Buettncr stated that the editors
were also going to include a picture of a
different group wearing pig costumcs?
From verbal responses I've gotten in the
past two weeks, the answer would prob
ably be no. Would it have mattcrcd if no
picture whalsocvcr had been uscd'7 Again,
probably not. In my eyes. however, these
“little" things mean a lot. They indicate
that the writers and editors at the Gum were
in truth trying to kid, not to oppress.

To conclude, I would like to say to those
who feel as I do, who still have issues about
this matter and feel that they h‘dVC bccn sir
lcnccd, to keep talking about it. Or write
about it Something. [don't feel to have
been spccxfically ccnsorscd, but I do feel
that my spccch has been curtailed. Alexis
dc Tocqueville said more than a century
ago thatAmcriclins often impose a tyranny
of nlﬂjorlly opinion, where when a matter
is considered closed by most Ui society it
becomes a serious socttil offense to try to
