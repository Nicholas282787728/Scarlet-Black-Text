Carleton Defends Title.

In last year’s meet, held at
Carleton, the Pioneers finished
third to defending champs Carle-
ton and second place Cornell.

Heading the list of individ-
ual delending champs is Grin-
nellian George Drake. George
has won the title in the mile-
run for the past two years ale
though he,might be held out
of that event tomorrow in fav-
or of more team points in the
quarter and half.

Bob Phelps is also a (wartime
winner in the meet, capping the
javelin as a sophomore and ju~
hior. But another Pioneer, Sam
Petroff, will probably make
Bob’s bid for a third crown a
somewhat more than' difficult
thing.

Phelps, Petroff Return

Petroff is himself a former
champ, having notched a spear
first as a freshman before he
went into the arm . Sam‘s lbest
toss this year of 20012" is better

m'd of 192’10" set by a third

Gri‘nneillan, Harry Barker, in
1940.

The Pioneor twosome of
Phelps and Petra” will not

be without competition, how—'
ever, for a third competitor,
Ulysses Doss cf Ripon, should
also he in the running.

Rounding out Grinnell’s tri-
limvil‘ate of twoetime conference
victors is Dick Walker who will
he gunning for his third discus
win. Walker too has eclipsed the
conference record this spring
with a l48' 9" throw and will he
out to break one of the oldest
marks on the books of 144' 0".
