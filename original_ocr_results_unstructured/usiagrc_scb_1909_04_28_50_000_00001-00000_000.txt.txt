Saturday with a (lily as lair as the
most exacting torrid wish, the twenty-
iourth annual Home Meet “'11: held on
Ward Field.
recent years, the event was a classy

Like all Home Me'ets oi

one, ﬁve new home records being set
up for the athletes of succeedrrrg years
to endeavor to outdo, For the ﬁfth
.consecutive tii'ue the class oi 1909 was
victors, but only after the urost heart-
breaking sort of a struggle with the
Juniors, who ﬁnished but two points
behind, - ‘

Aside from the fact or the '09 ric-
tor-y. the meet was a notahle one in
many respects. Although it is the
customary thing for such a meet to
bring out unexpected results, the Home
Meet of last Saturday saw more than
the usual number of surprises, some
of them of a nrost extraordinary char»
acter. The crowd was not held in sus-
pense long for the ﬁnish of the first
race, the one hundred yard dash,
when Turner, '11, defeated Hurt. '09,
and demonstrated most forcibly that
“dope" is a ﬁckle substance. From
this point on the meet was one contin-
ual succession of surprises, ﬁnding
their culmination in the unevpected
tailure of the Junior distance men to
land the points which had heen un-
hesitatlngly conceded them . Many of
the races brought out nerve rendlng
ﬁnishes and for these, the meet will
he long remembered. Notable among
these were the races run by O'Brien
in the half mile, sninstrom in the
quarter mile and Mcintosh and Flair
agan in the half mile relay, where the
outcome of the meet was decided.

The "stunts" arranged by the iemale
portions oi the classes were not below
the standard of previous years in or-
iginality and edectiveness. The Senior
damseis clad in white with gorgeous
cardinal and gold sunshades; the Jim-
iors, slightly less resplendent in coclir
ed hats and abundant purple and white
plumage; the Sophomore molds with
the triangle of 1911 predominating in
their costume and maneuvers and the
Freshmen with a typically freshman
hand and float, added to the meet that
picturesque touch which has made it
more than a mere sporting event in
College life.

The meet was run or: in a business-
like way, the best of feeling prevailed
and the only hitch was that ﬁrst in
the discus throw and third in the 220-
yard dash were taken by men not
properly entered who were denied the
points and medals.

The ﬁnal score was:
44; '11,. 34: '12, 29.
