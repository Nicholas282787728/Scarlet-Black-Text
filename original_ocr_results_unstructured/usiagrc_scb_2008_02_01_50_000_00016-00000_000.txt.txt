Gentle reader, ponder mote deeply tho highly personal spaee known as the lavatory We stun
dents eohabit, albeit temporally, the same ass>spacc as thousands of other discerning human
beings btfore us. When we scout a place to blast a duke, we should tonsider all.the factors:
spate, aetessihility, loeale, mnbrenoowall art and tharaeter. Not just any Mimic is worthy oronr
patronage, 1n faet, these two humbls writers will go as many as dozens (ifnot tens ofdozens) or
meters out orour way {or the right one'l‘he restroom itselfallows us to tap into humanity in a
way vvholly unique to the venue'l‘his week.we explore Burling basements bathrooms.

in the men’s, cultural insight

While running naked through Burl mg lin
biary as a prospie,l heard rumor otlegentlary
bathroom graffiti. lts attually something they
advelnse on touls believe it or not.

But today, I keep going back to tho Burt
mg basement bathroom for the santo reason 1
might go back to a museum The institution is

we are forced to wipe the proverbi slato clean
as custodians throw up a new coat orpatnt but
this only keeps our eavo drawings fresh and
current (“I killed Heath l.edg:l,"”0bama is a
politician's Chuck Norris").

Simply, bathroom walls are the ultimate
medium for anonymous personal expression
and discourse. What a trove of tontemporary
insight: inane ("I'm a Pokéinon!") and lewd
(“Great Sex Moves: The Tony Danza!") as well
as existential (“I am...”) and scholarly (“Recent
data confirm that dining hall food does indeed
contain laxatives”).

I also found the critical analysis oi’“Tits
vs. Ass vs. Reason vs. Instinct" a simple, even
puerile piece, but worth attention for its “11’
abashed ieonoolasm. Anatomy hobbyists visits
ing might take note ofa life’SlZCd depiction of
a veiny human penile organ, to rival even the
works ofDr. Grey himself.

Simply. bathroom walls are the ultimate

Anxiety induced in women’s

I taolt a biiefjaunt through the Burling
basement ladies loom and cmcroed feeling
adored and universallv hated ar thca same time.
VViilking though the stalls in that bathroom
was like embarking on the most tonfus- in
episode of selfndiseoveiy I have every cxpcl‘
cnced

I suitoted a personal ensls upon leavin
This maybe ironic. tonstdermg a lot of the
discussions graftlticd on those walls is about
noon/mg e 'stcnti‘al angst. There is a resound
ing message: “Love youtsolil" Also there is a
poem in which the author employs the theme
of kidnapping to desorihea a desired relation-
ship Love is love, regardless of first degi
felony status right?

Alter spending a mere 20 minutes confined
to those stalls, I was pretty sure I‘m the most
loved person on this campus.

At that point in my bathroom experience, I
knew I was pretty and intelligent and interest
ing and totally hott. But my inner anxiety is
only minimally subdued by the writing on the
wall. But then, I was also inundated by mixed
messages One minute I felt sweet. the nextl
knew that at least 20 people on this campus
secretly hate mt: for being a HUGE bitch

It's really hard to take a load offwhen you
know the lady in the stall next to you is equally
likely to hug you as to she is to stab you. En-
gaging in a complicated love-hate relationship
is not my ideal form of a study break. Sorry,
Bttrling.

Last Monday night (J an. 20,1 slipped off my
snowy shots outside my door as my ﬂoormaras
and I had done so many times before with no ill
consequences. The next morning I got up toi ﬁnd
my shoes had disappeared: GONE. Now, 1 only
have one question: WHO STEALS SHOESPDI
The whole thing seems absolutely ridiculous to
me. Yes,l asked FMithey didn’t take them and
they're not in my room, so it appears they were
stolen. seriously give them back. My fear is that
they were maliciously thrown in the garbage
(that would be, just cruel) but I hop: someone
has just temporarily kidnapped them with the
intent to return them to Kcrshaw 2235 very, very
soon. (See poster on entrance to Kcrshaw for a
pieture of the shoes in question). Really, WHO
STEALS SHOESPD!

Will he be home for Xmas?

It is the sworn duty ofthe Giinntjl senior to
complain about how things were better a stunt
threo yours- ago But mostly what I rooall is the
fact that we had a whole week separating the

end of Fall Semester and Christmas Day This .

proved to be ample time for everybody, no matter
how far they went going to get home tn rims for
the sort of family togetherness that only Christ»
mas provides

Alas, this past semester, with only a few days
between ﬁnals week and Christmas, it”, say A
GIANT GODDAMN BLIZZARD HITS
IOWA, wtll, those with flying plans would just
have to miss Christmas with their family

I spent my Christmas day in Newark airport
waiting for a plane. Thanks Grinneil.
