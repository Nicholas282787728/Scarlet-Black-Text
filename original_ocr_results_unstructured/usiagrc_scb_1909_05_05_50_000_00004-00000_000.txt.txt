lead one to the conclusion that the
committee is not to the best at its
ability carrying out the norh assigned
to it. But reﬂection will convince the
doubler that only through careful cori-
sltleratiou and discussion of the ini-
nutest details can this most weighty
and important ailnir be brought to a
ﬁtting consummation.

However. things may now he said
to be coming to a head and it ls qnlte
probable that are many weeks have
passed some deﬁnite conclusion will
have been reached and Grinncll Col-
lcgc will have a College Council that
will be approximately the choice or
the entire student hody.

It might be of interest to know that
the committee in charge of this is
composed of tho following members:

For the Seniors: Maud Wilkins,
