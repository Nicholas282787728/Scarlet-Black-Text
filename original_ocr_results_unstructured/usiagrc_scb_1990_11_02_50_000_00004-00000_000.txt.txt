 

Returning to the .
American Way

Group Includes Students and Faculty

By Karin Bellcmy

When senior Dcvani Scheidler
returned home from spending eight
months in Freiburg, Germany and
traveling extensively in the Eastern
Bloc, she was catapultedjust a few
days later into staff training at
Grinnell and into complete culture
shock. Because she was sochanged,
she had trouble dealing with family
and friends, and felt as if she
couldn't relate to the campus any-
more. She wanted to move on.

While traveling in the Eastern
Bloc, Scheidler “saw how people
live,peoplewhohavenohope...and
when I got home I realized how
much wehad....ltmademefeel like
I was valuing the wrong things in
life." That was when she put out
feelerstoseeifothernewlyretumed
students were feeling the same way,
an action that culminated in the
beginnings of a possible support
group for students that have been
abroad.

Seeing the conditions under
which people live in the Eastem
Bloc caused Scheidler to make a
drastic change in her career goals.

“Before. I wanted to be an at-
torney and make lots ofmoney...but
now I want to work in human ser-
vices" Scheidler‘s RA suggested
that getting involved in campus
volunteer activities might help in
her readjustment to the culture. _

However, Scheidler first wanted
to talk to other students who might
be having simtlnr feelings. A few
students contacted her after she put

Strategy

The United States’ massive
military buildup in northeastern
Saudi Arabia has not gone without
criticrsm, even in some quarters of
the Pentagon. By the end of thts
month, there Will be 350.000 US
troops ready to attack Iraqi positions
in Kuwait at a moment's notice.
And for many Senior officials, the
policy is a risky one.

Among them is retired Us.

cuss American strategy in dealing

talking to them on an individual
basis helped her work out feelings
that she was merely marking time
and waiting for her future to begin.

like at Grinnell, you're taught that
you should be able to deal with
things, and when you can‘t, you
feel like there’s something wrong
with you. Also, it's so easy to
forget the feelings and immerse
yourself [in college life]."

IanCzechowski,DirecIorofOff—
Campus Study, acknowledges that
Scheiiiler is not alone in her feele
ings of culture shock. Whether
they have only been away from
their own country for a few weeks
or almost a year, most people must
go through a certain amount ofre,
acclimation to their own culture,
evenifit’sreleaniing somethingas
simple as which way to look when
crossing the street.

“There‘s something about their
perception of the way things are
that changes, and it would be nice
to tap that, not just let that kind of
drift away,” said Czechowski.
Students can have problems sharing
their experiences since people who
know they’ve been awayof ten only
want to know whether the experi-
ence was good or bad, and may not
suck around long enough to hear
more.

One of Czechowski’s ideas for
providing a college outlet for such
experiences is to have professors
work with returning students to see

if there are things the students have
learned or experienced that would
make a significant contribution to
their classes. The off-campus pron
grams“make a very strong contrir
bution to the students' academic
program and... then there ought to
be something within the context of
what they’re doing when they get
back that draws on that experience
on the Curricular level," said
Czechowski.

Czechowski also thinks that
having returning students just get
together and talk might be a good
idea. Scheidler agrees. and be-
lieves that a student»mn support
program would get more response

potential program might involve

Czechowski and Scheidler, and
possibly other students who have
been abroad, are planning to dis
cuss techniques for dealing with
culture-shocked students with
Maureen Fitzgibbon,directorof the
International Students Organiza-
Lion. Fitzgibbon has some formal
techniques to help studentsre-enter

’ the American culture, and acouple

of years ago even onducted some
workshops on the subject. How-
ever, these workshops suffered from
low attendance.
Czechowskialsoplannedto talk
about this issue at an institute of
European Studies conference he

attended last week. He hoped to
find out if the conference could
help by sponsoring workshops for
off»campus study directors that deal
with how to work with issues of re-
entering the United States on their
own campuses.

Whatever the technique used,
both Scheidler and Czechowski
seem eager to getaprogtam started
for culturershocked students.
Scheidler also reﬂected on her
Eastern Bloc travels.

“In Grinnell we talk about us-
ing the word ‘woman' instwd of
‘girl’, and all these things seem SO
trivial when hereweare in this little
utopia These things are impor-
trtnt, but they’re not anywhere near
as important as what these people
are struggling with in these oUlcr

He argued that history was littered
with examples of such actions, in

problems that in his view did not
merit military solutions.

Soverel said that he also no

the documents that“distill what it is
