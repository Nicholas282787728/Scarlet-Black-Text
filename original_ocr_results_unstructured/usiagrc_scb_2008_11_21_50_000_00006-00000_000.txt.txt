Good Bye,
Lenin!
(2007)

Quirky, fun German film ist sehr gut

The Berlin Wall, a symbol ofcominunisr power and East-
West tensions. fell nearly 20 years ago, about the time most of
us were the apples of our parents’ eyes, rolling around in our
own slobbcr. Now we've bccornc socrallyawarc young men and
women, looking for the next opportunity for righteous anger
and social justicc (okay, maybe not exactly). Good Bye Lmilz,’
shows us what we can strive to be; active and involved in a
struggle that's worth fighting.

The story is centered on Alexander Kemer (Daniel Briihl),
a pro~western teenager living in East Germany with his moth-
er, a staunch communist. Right before the wall goes down, his
mother falls into a coma, and when she awakes it’s to a different
world than the one she used to know.

Or at least it would be a different world, if she were alt
lowcd to see it by Alexander, who is helped in his efforts by
his girlfriend (Chulpan Khamatova) and other friends. Her
condition requires stability, so finding out that capitalist pigs
have replaced her beloved communist leaders is quite out of
the question. Alexander is caught right in the middle of this

' charads, playing both jester and caretaker to his mother.

From fake East German news to rummaging through trash
for old food cans, Good Bye Lenin! keeps the story light with
humor and wholesome messages. It forces the viewer to quesr
tion how political systems and cultural values shape consuming
and social habits, bur skillfully avoids feeling like a sermon.

Most of us will never 1ch through Germany '39. but even
the most myopic capitalists among us can feel empathy with
a woman whose entire worldview has become obsolete over
night. A film this charming gets about as close as you can get
to being in a such a place with the absurdity fully present and
the unpleasantness removed (mostly removed—this is a drama,
after all).

So go to Good Bye Lenin! and think about how lucky we are
that the most massive political shift imaginable a few weeks
ago didn't involve a new currency or governmental system, Or
go simply to hear YannTiersen remind us what a movie sound
track should be.

Either way, es ist sehr gut.

Double.
Indemnity
(1944)

Nasty, brutish, and old: classic noir

DduHe Iiidemm'ly reminds us what it means to be a classic,
and has everything you could ask for from a movie made over
60 years ago.

Writer/director Billy Wilder’s Los Angelcs reminds us ota
simpler time, with great shots of sunny streets and extravagant
houses. In addition to the setting, we get Fred MacMurray’s
tragic portrayal of insurance salesman turned homerwrecker
turned murderer Walter Neff, and two more outstanding sup
porting performances.

One is the dark,sadisric Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stant
wyck), who starts flirting with Walter and eventually convinces
him to join in the murder ofa client who is considering the
purchase ofa large life insurance policy. The catch is that the
client is her husband, Once the crime goes down, the clever
Barton Keyes (Edward Robinson) is on the case.

A close friend of Walter's. Keyes is the claims adjustor at
the insurance company who refuses to bclicve that the death
really was an accident, though the police believe it .

Throughout the movie, Walter finds himself in a constant
balancing act between satisfying these two characters. One
night, Keyes is so close to catching Phyllis and Walter togcther
that Phyllis must hide behind the open door iii Walter’s apart-
merit.

Walter narrates the entire story to Keyes in a voice recorder,

a narrative technique that allows for both suspense and clarity
The nature oanlter’s recording is confessional, and we know
from the outset of the ﬁlm which murder he refers to, but the
exact context for why he is confessing and how he has gotten
there keeps us watching. As a narrator, MacMunay's voice is
regretful but thorough, which provides an excellent attention to
detail while also giving the film a steady pace.

Given the creative minds that are behind the film,this caret
ful narrative technique should serve as no surprise Based on
a novel by james cain,Wildcr also sought the help of crimc
novelist Raymond Chandler, who most famously wrote Tl): Big
Sire/a. Even though Doiin Indemnity is regarded as the epito»
me offrlm noir, with its dark scenes and a dark figmrc (Phyllis),
there are also funny moments in the script that supplement it.

Though the title refers to the rare insurance clause that is
supposed to give Walter and Phyllis double the money, the film
provides the same guarantee to viewe ou will not only rer
eeive a basic fulﬁllment of your entertainment needs. but you
will also be left thinking about just how crucl human beings can
be to one another.

Chinatown
(l 974)

Secrets define revtstonist noxr classrc

China/cam is a beautifully layered film, deserving every
one ofthe 11 Oscar nominations it earned at the '74 Academy
Awards. It’s also really entertaining, which makes its artistic
intentions easier to digest.

Director Roman Polanski takes us back to Los Angeles
during the '37 drought. Private detectiVe Jake Gittes (Nichols
son) is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Dianc Ladd) bccausc she
suspects her husband Hollis Muhvray is cheating on heft With
this standard intro, we expect a simple throwback to film noir
ofthe'405.

We think we know this story: Gittes is a typically gruff, allt
business detective who will stop at nothing to get to the bottom
ofthc case, and Ladd is the famine fatale. seductiw and sultry,
But after Gittes uncovers the adultery that he was hired to exV
pose, and after the pictures hc takes of Hollis and his young

female companion make front page news, we find that things
are not as they appear. They never are in C/Jillafa'wn.

First, things shift when the rra/Mrs. Mulwray (Faye DUt
naway) appears in Gines' office, demanding to know why a
relationship she wasn’t interested in ntposing has made front-
page news. Gettis realizes he‘s been duped in a plot to discredit
Hollis,who has the power to oppose the construction ofa new
reservoir. Dunaway’s arrual propels the him along its true mys~
tery arc, starting with the discovery ofHollis's drowned body in
a city reservoir, continuing with a plot to control and manipur
late ownership of water sources, and including, along the way,
dark secrets that have never seen the light of day

second, and equally important, things shift when we realize
that there is more to these characters than meets the eye. Mrs.
Mulwray is wonderfully skilled at evasion. Gittes is certainly
dogged in his determination to solve the case as it unfolds be—
fore him,but he cares a little too much,and is more tender than
a private detective is “supposed" to be.

As an actor, Jack Nicholson has always been consistent, He
has an incredibly weighty screen presence and always seems to
rise above rhc characters he's portraying, infusing them with
his own essence (as opposed to an actor like Meryl streep, who
disappears beneath her characters skins). Knowing this, how-
ever, didn‘t prepare me for how brilliant he was in Cbiiraimti.
In playing Gettis, Nicholson is at times tender and intense, but
above all he exhibits a rare subtlety that’s as surprising as it is
refreshing.

Dunaway, as the evasive and obviously wounded Evelyn
Mulwray, is wonderful. As the story progresses, we know that
Evelyn is hiding something, but we don't know arbor. Yet Du-
naway is able to he evasive and sympathetic at the same time,
letting the audience feel a pain we can't understand. And when
her highly theatrical moment of revelation finally comes, we
feel real anguish.

Yes. Cbizmzawn is a detective story with elements offllm noir,
but it's so much more than than It's a reflection on the ways
that loyalties in irttimarc relarionships can shift and change. Ar
the end of Chinatown it becomes clear that, while the plot is
airtight and extremely engaging the resolution is all about the
lonely and warped characters, needing closure on the wounds
that have been opened along the course of the film. When we
hear the classic line that ends the film, “Forget it, Jakei It's
Chinatown,"we realize that this film is it masterpiece.
