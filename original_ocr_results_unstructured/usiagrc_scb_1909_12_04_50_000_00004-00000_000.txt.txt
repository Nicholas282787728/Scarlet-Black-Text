After a thorough consideration or
football as u part of Intercollegiate
sports, Dr. Shaw niches this statement:
“Let. us rcpcui, then, that it is quite
time for the parents and the general
public to have their innings. The in.
Lel‘scholilstlc games nre carried to great
excess; they interfere with school

Professor Rusk, when asked for his
opinions in regard to football, said he
was convinced that its inlluence in this
college or any other was thoroughly
bad. "ii. is purely professional in spir.
it. The game probably has good feat-
ures, but the dangers of the mess plays
is impossible to avoid without entirely
