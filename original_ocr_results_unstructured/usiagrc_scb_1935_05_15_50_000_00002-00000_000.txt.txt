HAND WRITING ON THE WALL

The recent decision of the United States
Supreme court declaring as unconstitutional the
legislation passed by Congress providing for com-
pulsory old age pensions for railroads may be in-
dicative of the changing attitude on the part of the
Court, a change which steadily will trend toward
more and more conservative decisions.

The reversal of the pension legislation for rail-
roads is not in itself so important, because, al-
though an important piece of legislation, it was
not one of the major projects of the New Deal.
However, in so much as the decision may be
indicative of the likely end of other social security
legislation at the court’s hands, the recent pro-
nouncement is undoubtedly of the greatest im-
portance.

All signs point to a declaration of “unconst'
tutional" in regard to other social security legi
lation. The old age pension law which Congress
enacted assan outgrth of the Townsend plan
hysteria has much in common with the rail pen-
sion plan. In both cases individual private prop-
erty owners are involved. In the case of the
railroads the decision favored the individuals at
the expense of the good of society, while a similar
result may well occur in regard to the more gen-
eral social legislation. The government old age
pension plan provides for compulsion on the pri-
vate capitalists in order to raise the necessary
funds to aid in paying for the social security law,
and this will undoubtedly be strongly opposed
by the “rugged individualists” who will not toler-
ate any restrictions to their rights.

Undoubtedly the New Deal social legislation,
especially that part which calls for compulsory
contributions on the part of capitalists, will be
given a hard battle by the “vested interests"
which may result in the permanent crippling of
the entire program The United States has lagged
far behind the other countries of the world in the
matter of social legislation, and unless a more
liberal attitude is shown on the part of the
Supreme Court and on the part of the “vested
interests,” this country will undoubtedly continue
to lag behind, daily getting farther and farther
out of step.

To those who loudly proclaim the dangers of
the Reds and Communism, this might well be the
hand writing on the wall, for it is almost certain
that the American people will not tolerate the
frustration of social security plans merely be—
cause certain interests happen to have their toes
stepped on. Either the country will solve the
social problems by intelligent legislation, or —— .

A TIMELY SETTLEMENT

Workers in the Chevrolet plant at Toledo,
Ohio voted Monday night to accept the compro~
mise terms offered by the company and return to
work. In so doing they ended a strike which
threatened to» reach proportions so large that it
would tie up the entire automobile industry and
throw several hundred thousand men out of work.

The workers at the Toledo plant, which man-
ufactures transmissions, voted to strike because
the company would not recognize the right of the
A. F. of L. union to represent the men in collec~
tive bargaining. Workers at several other Chev—
rolet plants promptly walked out in a sympathy
strike, and still other plants were closed because
it was impossible to turn out cars due to a short~
age of transmissions.

With the number of men out of work growing
rapidly the federal government began to work
out a compromise. William F. Green, president
of the A. F. of Li, and Francis J. Dillon, A. E of
L. organizer for the automotive industry, at first
remained adamant in their demands, but after
several proposals had been rejected, they finally
came to an agreement and the possible catastro-
phe was averted

The only axe that the labor organization had
to grind with the automobile magnates had to do
with who should represent the workers in their
bargaining with the employer. It Was not a
question of hours, wages, or conditions of work,
but merely a matter of principles. It was no-
thing more than a strategical move by the Amer-
ican Federation of Labor in their fight for con-
trol of the labor class. Does it not seem to be
carrying matters a triﬂe too far when a labor or-
ganization threatens to tie up one of the largest
industries in the counry, and at the same time
to hinder recovery, a thing which is as vital to
labor as it is. to capital?

Furthermore, the A. F. of L. can claim in its
membership but seven or eight percent of the
workers in the automotive industry. At the
same time, it claims that it has control of the
transmission and carburetor factories and there—
fore can control the entire industry. Thus, for
the sake of prestige, an organization which repre-
sents but a scant minority of the workers jeopap
dizes the well-being of a far greater number of
families.

Except in cases when a strike has as its pur—
pose the correction of some major maladjustment,
the cost in the form of loss‘ in production and
unhealthy social conditions is far greater than
the gain, if any could possibly be, and it is doubt-
ful if a major maladjustment would have been
corrected by the Ohio strike. ——H. H.

CULTURE—WHAT is IT?
(Daily O'Collegian)

During one of our rare literary moments we happened
upon this definition of a cultured man by John Dewey:
“one able to enter understandingly into the lives of others.”
We paused to let it soak in at the time of reading, but we
did not catch its real signiﬁcance until we hearda speak—
er use it the other night.

Dewey's man of culture' would be one who would
certainly beloved by his fellow men; he would be an in—
dividual who would be of some use to the world; he
would do anything to help some one; in fact, Dewey's cul.
tured man would be an almost perfect individual.

How much different is Dewey's idea of a cultured in-
dividual than the ideas of modem college students and
professors. To the great majority of the college students
the cultured individual is one who can quote flawless
Shakespeare while reeling with intoxicating beverages. The
cultured individual is one who has enough money to wear
the newest clothes and drive the biggest cars—one who can
converse ﬂuently about tlle scenic wonders of America,
the latest dance step, the last big “bust" out of the state,
the discrepancies of the Bible and the probability of no
life after death. etc. The general college conception of
the cultured individual is one who does not have to do
manual labor for a living. A cultured person, most people
think, is one who can live mostly on incomes from invest.
ments made by some hard—working, penny-pinching fore.
father.

And the college professors think that a cultured person
is one who can rattle off all conjugations of a Latin verb,
decline a noun, talk in several languages, know the date
each president of the United States took office, know how
to spell correctly all the prehistoric ages, etc. Their idea of
culture is one within their own field—the field of learn—
ing.

Just how few truly cultured people there are in the
world one can realize easily by classifying them all by
Dewey's definition. And just how much better off the
world would be if there would be more cultured people of
Dewey's type one can easily imagine.

CHAPEL
NOTES

Monday
“Education Pays" was the theme of
the chapel talk delivered Monday by
c E, ‘1'. Spencer, profesor of Greek.
To prove this hypothesis, he related the
story of a young college graduate who
succeeded because of his knowledge
and the practical application of it.

Tuesday

“The comprehensive examination is
broad in its design and requires the
integration of subject matter in one’s
major field,” said Paul Spencer Wood,
professor of English, in chapel Tues-
day. “In the old days there was too
much separation of courses. As soon
as credit was earned, the matter was
closed. Little or nothing was carried
over from year to year. The object
of the comprehensive is to correct this
situation."

In order that students might be
more adequately prepared, special re.
views are offered by most all of the
departments. Both students and fa—
culty must cooperate in order to make
the most of the test, which is an exam—
ination of the students knowledge and
not of his ignorance. Besides the
special review, reading period for
seniors has been extended to include
May 27th and 28th. However, if the
senior student feels that he would
gain more by class attendance, it is
his privilege to go.

Mr. Wood declared that the two
extra days did not constitute a senior
holiday, and that next year with the
lengthened reading period. for the en.
tire student body, the special clays
for the seniors would probably not be
necessary.

All senior work must be handed in
before 9 a. in. May 27th. For other stu—

dents papers and reports must be,
