Jacobshagen photographs hit close to home

by Michael Kavanagh

Keith Jacobshagcn is a looker.
His job is to look athis surroundings,
attempt to understand them and ulti-
mately translate them into images on
paper. His success in these endeav-
ors can be seen in his exhibition,
entitled “Working Close to Home,"
which is currently on display in the
Print and Drawing Study Room on
the lower level of Burling Library.

Although Jacobshagen is best
known for his paintings of wideMid-
westernplainsandalmostpanoramic
views of sky, “Working Close to
Home“ is a collection of his photo-
graphs. Strikingly original, yet very
similarin composition andtoneto his
paintings, this exhibition tells the
viewer a great deal about both the
artist and his environment.

A professor at the University of
Nebraska, Iacobshagen has been tak-
ing pictures of the city of Lincoln.
Nebraska and surrounding areas for
many years. This exhibition includes
photos of seemingly mundane scenes
which anyone in the Midwest could
happen upon, But the unique way in

which Jacobshagen composes these
scenes and incorporates an element
of tension makes these everyday im-
ages fresh and interesting to look at.

A good example of this fresh
imagery is a photograph of a
watertower located in a suburban area
of Lincoln. The tower is placed in the
center of the picture plane and looms
up into spacebchind a strip of bright
green grass. The backdrop for the
entire scene is a thick and bleak,
grayegreen overcast sky, which lends
an eerie tone to the entire photo.

In fact, many of lacobshagen’s
works could be described as eerie, a
term to which he does not take of-
fense. Take, for example, the photo
of an abandoned, decrepit basketball
court in the middle of an expansive,
razed comﬁeld. Jacobshagen feels
that the eeriness some of his photo—
graphs produce is useful in creatinga
tension we don‘texperience in look-
ing at these images everyday. Thus,
he hopes the photographs will catch
the viewers off guard, causing them
to question or wonder.

Adding to the sense of eeriness
isthe fact there are no people in these

photographs—only clues or hints to
their existence. These hints might
take the fortn of a car parked in a
driveway, a grain elevator situated in
an empty field, or a bike path wind-
ing its way through a forest. These
visual clues ruggerl people to the
viewer without actually showing
them. When asked if he ever does
ponraits. Jacobshagen said, “I think
many of these photographs really are
portraits of people.”

Absence of humans contributes
to a theme of abandonment or descra
tion evident in many of the works on
display. This is especially true in the
basketball court photo mentioned
above andin aphotograph of a lonely
ttailer home parked in an overgrown
green field. Another example is a
sceneofa muddy construction site on
a dreary day and littered with pieces
of lumber and plastic. That particular
photo seems almost not of this world
when compared to some of the scenes
of residential Lincoln.

Perhaps the only real human
presence in Jacobshagen’s pictures
is his own presence. In several photo—
graphs his shadow can be seen. This

Prestigious ensemble to perform in Herrick Chapel

The internationally acclaimed
Ensemble for Early Music will per»
form a concert in Herrick Chapel on
Thursday,0ct 1 at 8:00 pm. This is
the first in a series of events spon-
sored by the Grinnell College Public
Events Committee.

The concert, which is entitled
1492, will be a showcase of conti-
nental music of the ﬁfteenth century,
to commemorate the 500th anniver-
sary of Columbus' discovery of
America. 1492 was designed to give
its audience a true taste of the ﬂavor,
through music, of each country rep-
resentedin theconcert; theEnsemble
will play delicate chanson: from
France, melancholy carols from En-
gland, stylish Italian canrt‘, rough

peasantalike (trader from Germany and
tuneful Spanishvillanct'os. This mu-
sic has been carefully chosen from
authentic sources to parallel the type
of music which was being written
and enjoyed in western Europe dur»
ing Columbus' time.

Aside from being chosen with
authenticity, this specialmusic is sure
tobeperformedauthenticallyaswell.
Over the past eighteen years, the
Ensemble forEarly Music has estab-
lished itself as America‘s foremost
interpreter of medieval and RenaisA
sance music drama. The Ensemble
will recreate the sounds of the
Columbian era by performing on pe-
riod instruments like crumhorns,
shawms, tabors, Iutes and ouds. The

Ensemble’s artistic director,
FrederickRenz, has received numcre
ous accolades, ittcluding two Pro-
ducers Grants from the National En-
dowment for the Arts. He is also a
respected harpsichordist.

Founded by Renz in 1974, the
Ensemble for Early Music has risen
to international farne and has per-
formed around the world, including
Europe,theU.S.,South America and
the Mideast. A recent article in the
Washington Post said of the En-
semble, “The music, both in selec-
tion and integrity of performance.
was excellent...delighting the eyes
and cars of an enthusiastic crowd. A
more merry evening would be diffi—
cult to find."

is due to the fact that he prefers to
photograph in morning or evening,
because he feels there is a “rich,
mysterious feeling at these extremes
of the day." This makes it almost
impossible to eliminate his shadow
because the sun is so near the horizon
at these times. The lighting in many
of his photos is, in fact, quite myste-
rious and textural.

This exhibition also includes
several whimsical pieces, such as a
photo of a giant chicken statue pre-
siding over an empty miniature golf
course. Of course, one gets the feel-
ing of abandonment here too, ale
though it is integrated with a sense of
humor.

Photography helps] acobshagen
by providing a different way of ap-
proachinghisenvironmentthanpainb
ing. According to Jacobshagen, pho-
tography is, "less presumptuous."
There is less equipment to be hauled
around, less preparation and less time
is involved. This makcsphotography
a more straightforward and compel-
ling method to describe one‘s sur-
roundings. Its instantaneous nature
causes photography to be a very re-

laxed,yetcreativeproccss.Also,this
medium gives Iacobshagcn a chance
to examine things he just wouldn't
paint, since he is so devoted to the
examination ofspaccrathcr titan form
in his painting.

Jacobshagen has been porting a
simple Palm Press camera around
eastern Nebraska for years, yet he
still ﬁnds interesting images to phoe
tograph. This is due not only to his
unique way of presenting such pro-
saic material, but to his diligence in
always carrying his camera with him
as well. This is why his art seems so
personalihedoesn‘tseekoutscenes
to capture on film. Rather, he photo
graphs what naturally occurs around
him.

Through years of examining his
surroundings,Keithiacobshagen has
learned to enjoy living in Nebraska
cvcn more. Working close to home
has made him appreciative of what
goes on around him. He says, ”The
best thing thatcan happen is for us to
take on a symbiotic relationship wrth
where we live. So many people want
to live somewhere else, but I‘m quite
happy whereI am."
