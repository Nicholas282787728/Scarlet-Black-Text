By r. G. Norris, Jr.

The intro-mural diamond season
just closed revealed an astounding ztrc
ray of classy ball players, and it is
again difficult to name the nine men
who were the class of the league.
However, the lack of good men for
some positions, particularly the ante
field, made the selection of a compe-
tent second teanr equally as hard as
a representative first team, and for
that reason, one balanced team of
eleven players was selected.

All-star teams are always a source
of contention. and at best they can
represent only the selection of one
man which generally causes a hundred
others to exclaiin that he know noth—
lug whatever about it. In this case
the writer attempted to pick a team
that was fairly representative, and at
the same time the best combination in
his own opinion. Because no attempt

Tennis became a motor sport in

ommendation made by a special com-
mittee. This year, tennis men will
ﬂaunt their Honor Gs. and will join
the ranks of football, basketball, and
track men as letter winners at Grin—

After examining the methods 0:
awarding letter for tennis in other
Missouri Valley schools, the cm‘mnlv~
tee drafted the following recommend-7r
tion, which was accepted; ‘

”In order to win an honor letter in

tennis, it is necessary to win three
singles matches, or two doubles and
two singles matches in conference
competition."
« There was no mention made of
what matches must he won in the Mis-
souri Valley meet to win a letter, but
a. clause will probably be added to the
recommendation to take care of this.

Next year, Grinnell should have one
of the strongest tennis teams in the
Missouri Valley. With struble and
stotts, unquestionable letter winners.
to form the nucleus or the team, and
Coggesball, state champion, and In-

The second College rcvuc made its
bow to u 10ml :lud pcrbaps iincr nl
public Friday evening, thereby prin-

.ing to many honest loll: that the G1 at

West is irot without its artistic lillll’cls

and that Flo ziegmld and charlie Dil- ,

liughillll hdve a lot to learn if they are
to make their ample and wicked en-
te :unincuts the equal of that which
cdiiied the large audience gathered iii
the High School auditorium.

A former critic on the staff of the
Scarlet and Black who valued truth
above his and the pirrsuit of happi—
rrcss wrote of the first College nevuo:
*therc are sonic things whrcli can he
done iii a song and dance enter-thine
merit, and some which cannot," We
agree with the gentleman yet we
might paraphrase and say; ”There are
many things, which an honest critic
ought to do, which he had better not."

The civilized minority bray need a
spokesman, but the elect who com-
pose the majority prefer a phonograph
record of “Ain't it grand" wluch may
be played on all proper occasions.

We thereioie announce to the vice
trola audience that the College Revue
was ‘a marvel of ingenuity and
sourtciulucss, and reinforce our been
of Praise by the substantial declare
ation that of all the revues produced
by the students of Grinnell college in
Grinnell, Iowa, the most recent ex-
hibition was unquestionably the finest
7 the last word in consummate taste
and artistry. Having done our Chris—
tiztn duty we address a different sort
of reader.

The entertainment which the Ex-
perimental theater offered Thursday
evening supplied adequate variety,
pleasing contrasts, and exhibited ma
terial which because of its potential
value as entertainment warranted bet»
ter treatment than it received. One
notable exception to this statement
must first he considered. V

In the ddnce»dramz, "Xochitl," the
combined efforts ol Misses Schwartz,
Dnstine and Adams, the dancing of
Miss Schwarz and sterner, the sinuous
movements ot a Welletl'ztined chorus
and the general effectiveness of the
masculine members of the cast con-
tributed a performance which was
the high point of the evening’s pro»
ceedings. In spite of lighting which
we cannot yet believe the product of
Miss Rnst‘s customary ingenuity, and
with the accompaniment of an orches-
tra whose volume was insufficient in
a large auditorium, the spectacle was
impressive and moving.

Miss Schwarz both as the composer
and director of the ballet and as one
of the chief performers deserves un-

LAVA FLOW IN SOUTHERN HAWAII

telling of a recent Holt to the lava
ilow in southern Hawaii. The lcttcr

April is, 1026
To lhc S. and 13, Editor;

Friday morning “6 learned that tho
lava flow in the southern pdrt of this
i‘lZiud was reaching really important
proportions, and was already near the
government road. of course, we here
all eager to see it, and by four o'clock
I Vl‘ in one of the runny, many autos
humping over the hundred miles of
horrible road to view it,

When we had traveled only a little
over half that distance we could see
the red light reflected in the clouds.
It grew brighter and brighter, until it
secured that every hill iitust bring us
iirto view. By ten o'clock we rcached

the place where nrost of the cars were l

parking, two wheels up on the rocks
and two in the road, leaving a narrow
enough margin for passing machines.

Our Own Capacities And Our

“Education does not consist oi any
number of hours of scheduled work;
education is a discovery of our own
capacities and ambitious, and only
when we discover what our life is to
be and can organize these capacities,
will we be capable of creative achieve-
ment in our lives. The utilization of
ever unfolding knowledge makes for
the greater enrichment of life." Pro-
fessor .l’. D. Stoops, addressing the
members of the Senior class at senior
chapel on Friday morning thus stress-
ed the importance of concrete use of
education.

“When the educated Chinese and
Japanese evince their desire to learn
all they can about our engineering,
road building, industrial methods but
refuse to think of surrendering their
own particular traditions oi existence.
they are attempting the impossible.
They are no more capable of this than
we, who are in the face of changing
industrial orders, are capable of re—
sisting a change in our moral and rec
ligious orders. We are living on the
threshold of new things. We are eu—

GREEK MYTH 0F PERSEPHONE TO
BE THEME OF ANNUAL MAY FETE

 

The old Greek myth of Persephone
is the theme of the annual bley ictc
which will be held next Friday eve-
lling, May 21, at 8 o’clock. The mid—
dle campus will be transformed into
a Grecian grove on one hand and the
realm of Pluto on the other as the
settings for the portrayal of this iztc
mans myth.

Work on the costumes, which are
being made especially for this produc‘
tioii by members of the senior class in
lestivals and pageants, is progressing
rapidly, and rehearsals on the dances
are working out unusually well.

Thc story or the fete, which is calls
ed “Persephone,” oi- "Springs Awale
chins,” is as follows:

In the opening; scene Persephone
and her maidens arc dancing joyously
and are joined by a group of huntress-
es just returning from the chase.
As Persephone is gathering ilowcrs
the earth suddenly opens before her
and Pluto, the god of the under-world,
comes to claim her. She is at first
tci-i' icd and turns to tlcc, but at last
she yields to him and goes with him
to his realm. Persephoue’s maidens

_ are grief stricken and be: her to re-

turn, but to no avail.

 

Overture to Tannhauser

The second scene portrays the hap—

piness of Demeter, the mother or
Persephone ,who is surrounded by her
children. When suddenly pcrseplione‘s
maidens enter and tell of the capture
by Pluto, joy is changed to sin ow,
and Demeter sits alone and grieves.
Later she begs Persephonc's maidens
to implore the gods to return Perse~
phone to them, but help does not
come, and Demeter condemns every
growing thing upon the face of the
earth until her daughter shall be me
stored to her.

Scene three depicts the stormy
winds, the lilightcd'ilowcrs, and the
suiiei-ihg resulting from this curse.
Finally Zeus sends Hermes, the mcse
scnger of the gods, to Pluto, allowing
l>crscphonc to return to Demeter.

The next scene is iir the under—
world where Pluto’s gnomes are danc-
ing and Pluto is vainly trying to ap—
peasc his queen, Persophonediy offer»
irrg her a crown and then fruit. She
ueats six pomegranate seeds and is
condemned to spend six months of the
year, over winter, in Pluto’s realm.

In the last scene Persephone has re—
turned to earth for six happy mouths,
and Demeter brings the flowers to
life and the gladness of springtime
again this the world

I could read the time by my w st

watch, liiouglr “‘L. were sllll a quarter

or a mile from the lav itso '.
l Lind hows slowly

oiu- l glimpse showed us a long,
low lull across the road iii front or
us, and although the outliuc has
marked in black where it had cooled
slightly. most of the lava was still
glowing- red. This is a rough flow,
"cnllod by Hawaiians ’“azt (ah»uh), and
has not the appearance oi incited
1metal, as most lava has, but llitezlrl
is a huge, slowly moving mound of
ii‘ed hot clinker-s. At first it was mov—
ing to our right, but a little later its
course changed and it turned toward
us with a broadside attack. Don’t
imagine, however, that the spectators
wcrc in any danger, as it moves very
slow iwc heard guesses at eve ,
where from 35 to 600 feet an hour

it is far more beautiful when mor—
zing toward one, as then the motion of
the mass behind loosens chunks large
and small that fall with a continued
display of sparks and cascades and
rolling lumps o[ the brilliant red, it
ls a spectacle worth the entire trip
to the islands:

Jus‘t at the place where the lava
came, a house stood on the mauka
side of the road, (If you have read
the "House Without a Key,” you know
that mauka, toward the mountain.
and nickai, toward the sea, are the
only directions in Hawaii) 01d Has
waians living there believed that all
volcanic activity is caused by the ang.
er of the goddess Pele, and natur—
‘ally desired to propitizlte her. They
placed food on the steps, and offered
prayers, but tor some reason the
goddess was not satisfied, and the
house burned down.

lluriis Church

Across the road stood a tiny church.
The lava pushed it slowly, before it
caught fire, and set the bell ringing.
The tones rang out until the flames
reached the steeple and the bell crash—
ed down.

After we left, the course changed
again, and the now now entered the
sea, Besides the boiling or the water
and the clouds of steam, the explose
ion of huge boulders with showers of
red hot rocks odds to the brilliance of
the sight.

Old people, mothers with babies in
their arms, small children—everyone
—hastened to view the flow. And in
every sort of conveyance, We saw eV<
erything from the twawheeled cart
(and a bicycle) to a huge Pierce-Ar-
row. i
. Some children in the rear of the
press climbed a tree for a better view.
As the lava advanced, the crowd re-
treated, until the rest were behind
these children. mien they felt the
heat toasting them, they also retreat—
ed, to leave the tree to its fate. soon
the falling chunks piled around the
trunk, higher and higher, it began to
blaze, and the weight of the lava
pressing against it, bowed it lower-
and lower and lower. The leaves
rested on the ground before us, until
another cascade of the glowing mass
dried them to a crisp and they burst
into flame.

Uiidcrbrusli Burns

The forest in the region of the flow
is very light, so that the under-brush
and young saplings gave us flat-cs of
flickering light besides the weird rcd
below us and above us.

The source is soventccu miles above
the government road, so now the full
length of the ilow is more than twen—
t, miles. The mass is sonre tbil-tl'
feet high at its crest, and was 600 iect
across before it mftdc the turir, which
broadened it considerably. I am glad
that I saw it first by night, for it is
much more spectacular then than by
day. The ignorant native and the
volcanclogist alike are hushed with
awe before the sight. It is more awe-
soinc than anything I had dreamed.

There are many new and strange
things here that I had wanted to write
to my Gl'illnell friends, but nothing I
could have chosen would be as unique
as this.

Crccting to all, irom the tropics,

Sincerely,
Margaret Field Pitcher.

The regular weekly prayer service
will be held in thc Quadrangle draws
ing room Sunday morning. A special
program of music has been planned.
