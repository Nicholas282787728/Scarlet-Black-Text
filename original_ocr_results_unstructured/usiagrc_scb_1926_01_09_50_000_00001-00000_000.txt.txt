lf the faculty pass the student
council resolutions, made this week,
each building and cottuge may may
have two parties a year and informal
dancmg will be permitted.

A committee of students made rec-
ommendations in a meeting before the
holidays and at a meeting of the stile
dent council held this week it was
voted to adopt all resolutions except
one, which provided for the more free
exchange of guests between the quads
ranglc and dormitory dining rooms.

The resolutions which will be sub-
lnitted to the faculty for approval are
in substance as follows,

1. Each cottage and building shall
submit during lhe lirsc two weeks of
each semester three choices of pos-
sible antes for parties. A committee
from the student council is to select
from these dates, three dates for cot-
tage parties and threc for building
parties. Not less than two parties
can be held on one night.

2.. Infurmal dancing shall he per—
mitted in the cottage parlors.

ii. on. nights when buildings and
cottages are having parties the other
buildings and cottages may have in-
formal dancing.

The above resolutions wcre passed
in accordance with the apparent will of
the student body to have two house
dances a year. Under the arranger
merit made in resolution one, not over
twelve dates a year can be utilized for
this purpose as at least two buildings
or cottages have their parties on the
same night, It will be possible for
more than two parties to be held on
the same night, however. The doub-
ling of dates will cause house funCr
tious to not interfere with varsity
dances.

VETERANS WILL BE MISSED

Scllill'll‘lclml', Jones, Kim-fort and
Hooter Will Try to Millie I’D For
Loss of Morgan Taylor.

Track aspirants have been working
out for over a week and before long
"Conch "Doc" Huff will have a team
ready for indoor competition. With
an unusually interesting schedule
ahead of them the candidates for the
team are cxpccicd to be at their best
and track followers predict a strong
team by the time spring rolls nround.

This winter the Pioneers will run
against Drake and Alnes and will end
up at the Missouri Valley indoor-
championship at Kansas City. There
is also a possibility of Gripnell enter-
ing other indoor meets.

Although the loss of Morgan Taylor,
Leon Jones, Floyd Grcen, John Stotts,
Gordon Kitchen, Jack Rage, and Claire
li‘eyer will be keenly felt, the squad
this yenr shows promise of being a
well balanced outfit. ,

Leading candidates are Captain
Merritt Scharnweber, Manly Jones,
Foster Rinefort, Gordon uleeter, Tom
Gould. Willis Putton, Eugene, Woods
ruff, Juhh Whitley, nonnld Laird.
Humid Hoffman, Austin Guild, Angus
Campbell, Draper Long, Russell King-
cry, Charles Slye, Fred nisser. At
the completion of the basketball sch-
edule the team should be strengthen
ed by the ability of Ray Niblo, Weir
ucll Davis, Laurence Hays, and Lee
Bradstreet.

Sellnrnwebcl‘ ' Fast Sprinter

Scharuweber is one of the fastest
men in the conference being credited
with 9.9 in the century and 21,6 for
the 220. He runs these two special-
ties consistently, and in addition runs
as anchor man on the short relays.
“Weber" shuuld be u sure point wine
par for the Scarlet and Black this
winter and spring.

"Pinky" Jones, a man of two years
experience, is a reliable quarter miler
and is counted on to carry Grinnell’s
colors to the front in his favorite
event Jones also rllns the shorter
shorter distances in fast time. He
will be a valuable ruunning mate to
Capt. Scbcrnwebcr.

Rlllefort and Meeter are two weight
men who should rank high in their
events, They are both juniurs and
were letter men on last year‘s team.
Rinefort has a mark of 145 ft. in the
discus, and one of is feet, 3 inches
in the shot. He is nlso capable of
running the 100 yd. dash around 10
flat. llleeter performs with discus,
shot and javclin and rates among the
best in the Valley.

' Gould Brothers Good Milers

Tom Gould and his brother Paul
are both good milers and should turn
in some fast time this year. Tom has
had experience as a member of the
cross country team, while Paul slur-
red for the freshman team.

Woodmff and Whitley are two
milers who ought to show up well on
the indoor cluders,

Nlblo, Bradstreet, and Davis are
counted on as contestants in the
jumps, and Niblo, Patton, Long and
Hays are candidates to fill the lull-d-
ling shoes of the blonde Taylor and
Floyd Green. “Sunny” Davis perform»
cd quite well with the weights on the
prep squad last spring.

Hays, Campbell, Kingcry, Guild, and
Hoffman are all quarter milers and
from them u goud relay icam should
be developed.

Slye is a half miler who is being
watched as a corner, and kisser
should develop into a good milcr.

Laird has shown very encouraging
prugress with the juvelin and by the
time thc open season begins he
should be throwing it ncar record
distance. l

With ample time to work out and
with the best of schedules the Pin-
nccrs are expected to be represented
by a strong and well balanced track
squad. With a good record behind
them and very encouraging prospects
before them the Scarlet and Black
team of 1926 should rate high in the

nliddlcwest

This will make it possrble for pomts

Ciniliza-tion 1; Sick

Says Steiner To

Des Moines Chamber Of Commerce

The business men in the Des Molues
Chamber 01' Commerce were shocked
yesterday noon when Professor Ed-
Ward A. Steiner told them civilization
is sick and needs an immediate Cure.

Many shihboleths of our modern
age were attacked by Dr. Steiner in
his address which was. declared one
of the most unique ever heard by Des
Moilles business men.

“One of the causes of the sickness
nf our civilization lies in the con-
sciousness of mcn that men’s prolesA
sion and his performances are at
odds. He warships God but he serves
his union. He, gives alms to the pnor,
but he lays up his treasurers in tax
exempt bonds He believes in democ-
racy, but he brings up his children as
snobs. He believes in chastity, but be
relapses into polygamy, legalizing it
through the divorce courts.

"Fundamentalists and modernists
alike believe that becausc we are go~
ing faster we are going safer; be-
cause we havc built skyscrapers, we
have grown towards heaven; because
we have created so rnnny new things,
we have attained a new life.

“The progress of science is not 117
together a boon to mankind. We are
not thinking more clearly because we
have electric lights. We are not more
discriminating because we have the
movies. And we are not more spilt

MARTIN WILL BAPTAIN
1328 TWA EUUAD

All-V' ley Tackle “ill Lend Pioneer
'l'emn Next Season: Hus Starred
For Tim rein-s.

Porter Martin will captain tll91926
Grinnell football team as a result of
the annual election by the gridiron
letterrnlen, For two years Martin has
been an outstanding Pioncer line-
mall, making the third all-Valley, and
sninlng honorable mention on the fill-
State, mythical teams during his
first playing season, then making the
first all-valley and all-state fenms
the past season.

Martin gained his preliminaly
'knowledge of the pigskin game at
Fremont high where he starred as a
quarterback, Upon entering Grinnell
he went out for freshman football and
made his numeral at the quarterback
position on one of the flashiest prep
elevens ever developed at the local
institutiul'l When Hyland and Black
took over the coaching destinies, Mar-
tin was shifted to the line where he
has remained. During his first year
on the varsity he played at tackle, blit
was shifted to guard last seasun to
bolster up the center of the line.

Martin was undoubtedly one cf the
licst lincmcn in this vicinity inst fall.
He is it big aggressive fellow who tips
the scales at about 190 and is fast in
breaking through the line, spilling
plays before they get under way. He
is equally fast in getting down under
punts, is adept at blocking punts and
is a Conslstent tackler. A year ago
he played every minute of every
game, without Calling time or allow-
ing more than three or four gains
through his side of the line, while this
year without calling time or allowing
any serious advances of the opposi-
tion, he played all but one quarter of
the season's games, that quarter be-
ing during the Penn game when the
locals led 21-7, and Hylnnd substitut-

KAUX AND AHINNELL
DEBATEHS BLASH AA
AAA FEPHHBLEM

Forensic ’l‘ilt Here Last Night Was
One of the Most Entertaining
lIeltl Here in Recent l'etll's.

ARGUE IN POPULAR STYLE

Smith, Scllill and Itcill Pleﬂse Crowd
With Speaking Ability: Knox
Men Halve More Facts.

(nohcrt Burlingzlme)

One of the most thoroughly satis-
factory debates which has been held
in Grinncll during the last two years,
at least, resulted from the clash be—
tween a Gl'innell affirmative team
and a negutive trio from Knox Col-
lege, Galesburg, Illinois, last evening,
on the proposition "Should the’ Unit-
ed States subsidize its Commercial air
fleet?” A few more such debates will
do much to popularize forensic ac-
tivities on the local campus.

The Griunell team, which consisted
of Russell Smith, Emerson Schill
and Loren Reid, maintained that com-
mercial aviation should be granted a.
subsidy because the present system is
inadequate, a subsidy would remedy
those inadequacies and the proposed
subsidy is economically sound. These
contentions were directly met by ihe
Knox speakersiAlmont Lindsey,
Phlllip Granville, and Reynolds Ever-

‘ett—who opposed any kind of a. sub-

sidy grant, for three reasuns: it is not
needed, it would not fulfill the pur»
pose for which it is intended, and,
granting that it did succeed, grave ec-
onomic evils would result.

Smith Opens Case

Russell Smiih, in his opening
spcccll, pointed out very effectively
that despite the fact that the United
States is the muthel‘ of aircraft we
are now far behind other countries in
putting the aeroplane to work. Smith
did his most telling work in rebuttal,
refuting several of the most important
constructive arguments of the Begs
utive,

Emerson Schill, engaging in his
first intercollegiate debate, indicated
that only a few companies are at yres~
ent able to finance the basic neces»
sitles which are essential to an air-
craft industry, and that a subsidy is
therefore necessary. Schill’s work,
although by no means brilliant, show-
ed sound, logical thought, which
should make him an important factor
in future debates.

Reed Gives Fine Speech

Loren Reid gave the best debate
speech, both constructive and rebut-
tal,,wliich the writer has ever heard
given from a» A, n. H. platform. With
a clever admixture of wit and fact, he
showed that the proposed subsidy is
ccouomically sound, and also effic—
iently recepitulated the entire affirm-
ative case.

The Knox debaters excelled their
Grihncll opponents in knowledge of
the facts and in logical thinking, but
the borne representatives showed
their superiority in stage presence,
fluency of speech and originality.

lime Interesting Discussion

No decision was rendered, but an
interesting half-hour of general dis
cussicn from the flour followed the
formal debate. The lending spirit in
this open forum was Professor w, B.
Shaw. debate coach at Knox, whose
teams participate in no other kind of
encounters.

Professor Edward E. T. Spencer
presided over the meeting with tact
find spirit.

Crinuen Forensic is pleased that the
first intercollegiate debate held under-
its auspices should have been so suc—\
cessful. The audience is said mhave
been the largest which has attended a
debate on the Grinnell campus in re
cent years, excepting only the two in-
ternational clashes, iFol-ensic hopes
that the popularizing of debating tac-
tics ‘will serve to maintain and in-
crease thot interest. ‘

Committee Plans for
Mld-Semester Formal

Extensive plans are being made for
thc Semester Formal which is to be
