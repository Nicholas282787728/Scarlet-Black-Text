N0 INTEREST?

Last year, following resolutionii
by town men and to“ \ women
organizations, asking [\I' repre-
sentatives on the Student council.
the council decided that each of
the two groups should elect one of
its body to represent them.

It is not difficult to see the need
for representation of groups on
the counoil, since-they make up a
large part of the student body,
asd are as much a part of Grinnell
as the men and women of the
dormitories and quadrangle.

What we can’t comprehend, is
the that, that in spite of their ill-

t in taking a hand in the ac-

es of ‘the school, neither
group has sent ll representative to
a Student council meeting tllis
year.

Either the town groups have
forgotten about their election to
the council, or they have lost that
keen desire to cooperate, which
was so apparent last year,

MEMORIES OF GRINNELL
The impressions Grinuoll leaves
a Visitor after only a few hours
it are shown lleloi ﬁan exerpt
from The ('l‘eightrlniallr Creighton
university newspaper.

Memories that persist: Tile
sleepy and unconscious beauty
of Grinnell. The tranquil cam-
pus sheltered beneath the pl- ,
tot-ting mantle of a small Town
town. Groups of students that
seem to be so happy. An nil‘ of
content and well being that
pervades the atmosphere. The
feeling of being in the presence
of some unknown force that
makes for complete peace. A
sudden realization that “in this
plane dwells tradition.” Tile
th '11 of the game and the long
drive home over the icy roads
of Iowa. Monday morning
classes and no preparation of
assignments The feeling that it
was worth it. Tllat'. College.

“WE”

\Ve Grinnell students pride our-
s ll'os on our participation ill ac-
ti\ ties that go to make up the
college.

We talk of "our” League board
and “our" Council of House
Presidents and take pride in the
fact that so much student help is
used.

\Vith lch an attitude held hy
the majority of, the student body,
it would seem only just that the
Sallie stand be taken toward sing»
ing the shunts that have a large
part in the Chapel and Vesper
sci-vices. ‘

Just as the parts we play ill our
college life lead to our affection
for Grinnoll, so chorus . aing
would lead to deeper appro tion
of the chants.

Surely Chapel and Vesper scr-
rices are not to be taken like doses
of medicine, administered by the
speaker and the choir So, as we
show our Grinncll spirit in other
things, let us demonstrate with
song at Vespers.

TIME TO STUDY
(Daily Trojlm)
With a good hair of the semester!
gone and mid-year's waiting not sol
far distant, it is time student's serr
ionsly bethought themselves of study—l
ing and catching up on all the work
that has been allowed to slide along
during the semester so far.
The first. few weeks of school are
exciting times of attending football‘
games, planning on the main trip of“
the year north, and in general eﬂ~
joying the various social activitiee'
that start the school whirl after three“
months of vacation and idleness.
Now, however, the football season,
is about to draw to a close, Lne Jun-_
ior prom and Pan-hellenic formals‘
will soon be things of the past, and
studies are daily assuming alarming'
proportions of importance.

,ccn got here am much more import
ant than work under great teachers
and scholars who have nn‘oppoltun-
jity of seeing their problems and help-
‘ing them."

“All institutions either furnish or
illustrate patterns of lifts, mental and
spiritual, as well as physical," sold
Frederick L. Baumann, associate
professor of history, in his chapel
talk.
“The principal purpose of college
is the opening of wider and wider
vistas for students and faculty. Posi-
tions and actions in college, when
viewed in the aspect of El. large lifc,
take on a, different meaning. It is
no longer what one can get. by in
best but what one needs most that is
the standard. A player's conception

Term papers are required and must
be written, flunk notices decreased,
and exams seriously considered.

The students who have let their
studies slide indifferently along, (end
who has not?) are fast approachingl
the time when they must lmuckle‘
down to work, or admit of failure to ‘
the first semester.

The fun has been prolonged and on

serious if less entertaining things be
considered.

dramatic director of summer camps

 

By MAX Ross
We take this opportunity to pay
tribute to the greatESt cross-country
team in the history of Grinnell college
7the finest collection of distance
stars ever to bear the scarlet and

black.

«so

This championship outfit won all
iour meets of lthc year by decisive
null-gills against such first class com-
petition os Iowa State college, the
University of Missouri, the Universi-
ty of Iowa, and Drake. W'innlng‘
from all three Iowa schools, they icy
deﬁnite claim to the state champion-
ship.

The scores of the meets were es
follow
Grinnell 26, Iowa. State 29
Grinuell 23, Missouri 32
Grinnell , Iowa 34
Grinnell 23, Drake 32

x 1 2e
The crack Pioneer trio, Captain
Mike Pilbrow, Joe Pfeiffer, and Tom-
my Gordon, nunoxod the first three
places in three of their meets, and
at no time did any of them finish
any further hawk their fourth. Twice
they breasted tho llnpe hand in .lumd

to form a triple tic.

Don Barber was the number four
marl on the team and gave a good ac«
count of himself in every l‘ﬂce.’ Not
gifted with natural running ability,
Barber is u plodding type or runner,
and is usually slow to round into top
form. The other men rounding out
the squad were Bus Brown, Joe Poj-
man, and Martin Van Patten.

Every one or the ﬁrst four men on
the team is a. resident or former resi~
dent of Chicago; all of thorn nro
cloec friend-3 and [mi oround together;
ouch hos Socialistic inclinations (dc<
lsplte rumors of Heiffer‘s turning
traitor); and they all wear ludicrous
top—pieces. Joe Popmn is ulso a. for»
mer resident of Chicago; three of tho
members oi the squad are quodrungie
waiters, while a fourth hands them
their food from bohoud the steam
tonic; and all of them nro mainstays
oi Conch Duke’s track squndl

s n it

Never in the history of the sport
at Crinncll has there been such a. fine
aggregation of stars on one team. Al»
though aptairl Pilbrow and Barbel-
will be lost by graduation, prospects
are encouraging for it good team next
year. But it is doubttul whether the
1933 team can reach the high standr
yard set by the present squad, which
takes rank with the finest teams in
the country.

Scholars are men of peace; they
bear no arms, but their tongues
are sharper than .tius’ sword,
their pens can further and give
a louder report than thunder. I
had rather stand in the shook of
a basilisk than ill the fury of a
merciless pen. — Sir Thomas
Browne.
