lllBKIES

IT'S All A MATTER OF ESE

When you come right down to it, you
smoke for one simple reason i i . enjoy-
ment. And smoking enjoyment is all a
matter of taste. Yes, taste is what counts
in a cigarette. And Luckies taste better.

Two facts explain why Luckies taste
better. First. L.Sr/M.FrT.—Lucky Strike
means ﬁne tobacco . . . light, mild, good-
tasting tobacco. Second, Luckies are ac—
tually made better to taste better .
always round, ﬁrm, fully packed to draw
freely and smoke evenly.

So, for the enjoyment you get from
better.taste, and only from better taste,
Be Happy—Go Lucky. Get a pack, or a
carton of better»tasting Luckies todayr

COLLEGE SMOKERS PREFER lllBKIES

A comprehensive survey—based on
31,000 student interviews and super-
vissd by college professors—shows that

prefer Luckies to all orhsr brands] The
No, 1 reason: Luckies' better taste!
