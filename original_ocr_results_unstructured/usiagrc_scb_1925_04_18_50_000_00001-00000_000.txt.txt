In his speech oi presentation, Dean
Noller‘a discussed something of the his
tory of Fhi Betta Kappa. The organ—
ization originated in William and
Mary's college, a rural school in vii--
ginia, in the year 1776. By virtue of
its foundation at such an early date,
Phi Betta Kappa is the oldest student
organization in existence today.

Phi Betta Kappa was orga'nized in
the Virginia college as a society for
the study oi literature and the pro-
motion of good will among the stud-
ents. However, somehow in the
course of years, this particular society
underwent a process of evolution and
came to fill the cultural need for rec-
ognition of superior scholarship To-
day. Phi Betta Kappa is an organiza-
tion whose chapters in all the leading
schools of the country, , re the coir
'lege world an opportunity for recog_
nition of the primary purpose of a
college education,

The Grinnell chapter which was
authorized in 1907, and which received
its charter in April of the following
year, elects not over nucrseventh oi
the graduating class to its meiullera
ship each year. By custom, the iirst
four students, who are pledged m the
fall oi their senior year, are elected
purely on the basis oi high scholastic
standing. Ncil Crone. Mary Droterrch,
John stchn, and Mnmilerlte Merl .
nran composed the‘ group of four that
were elected to the Grinnell chaptcr
last fall.

Athletic Director Huff, accompanied
by eight varsity track men, left for
the Kansas Relays yesterday after-
noon. Tire meet takes place this at-
ter-noon and the wearer of the Mala
tease Cross entered are Captain Tay-
lor. Scharnweber, L, Jones, Jones.
Kitchcn. niuelort and Meeter

With approximately one hundred
schools representing 13 states entered
in the meet, it gives promise oi being
one oi the fastest outdoor carnivals in
the country. Some oi the schools en»
tercd are. Universities of Iowa, Kan-
sas, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Michigan,
Minnesota, Illinois and Missouri. No-
tre Dame and Marquette are also
sending teams.

The Pioneers are running but two
relays, the mile and half mile. In the
mile, Scharnweher, Kitchen, M. Jones
and Taylor will each step a quarter
and Scharnweber. L_ Jones, Kitchen
and Taylor sprint a two-twenty each
in the half mile relay. Meeter and
Rineiort are entered in the shot put
and discus and Meeter is also compet—
ing in the javelin throw.

The special race of the day is to be
the one hundred and twenty yzil-d high
hurdles in which Morgan Taylor is en-
tered with some of the lastest compea
tition to he found in the country to
day. With Riley oi the A. A. U.; Kin»
sey of Illinois; Weir oi Nebraska and
Eagle of Kansas in the leature. a new
record should he set and a fast exhi-
bition of clearing the sticks will be
shown. Little is known of the re—
spective merits of these men but they
should be about even and agood fast
race is assured. —

Grinnell was only fairly fortunate
in the drawings, getting the twelfth
lane in the half mile relay and the
fourth lane in the mile event. They
drew the pole in the medley race but
are not competing. ‘
Speculation on the strength oi the
team is uncertain at this time in the
season With four men who can run
the 22o under twenty'rtwo seconds.
however, the half nnle relay should
place, Rlneiort will have a good
chance to take points in the discus,
and both he and Meeter should count
in the shot. Meeter has been throw-
ing the javclin far enough to point in
most meets. and if he performs irp to
his usual standard, should place today.

Taylor's running mate. Green, is
still suifering from a pad leg and is
unable to make the trip. This will
weaken the chances oi the Pioneers
considerably in the halteluile relay
while there was a good chance of his
pldcing in the hurdles.
