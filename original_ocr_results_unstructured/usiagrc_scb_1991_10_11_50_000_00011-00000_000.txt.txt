"long road trip leaves team fatigued

By Alex Severens

The Grinnell women came away
, from a long weekend road trip with
‘ three disappointing losses. Last Fri-
’ day, the team departed for Chicago to
, play in the six team tournament at
( Lake Forest College. While the Pio-
neers did not play badly. the long trip
and the relentless Saturday schedule
. took its toll on the team.
' Grinnell began the day playing
I one of the stronger teams in the tour-
, narnent, the University of Chicago.
The Pioneers took the University of
Chicago to three sets, but eventually
fell, 15-6, 8715, and 15-10.
The home team, Lake Forest. also

; 10 and 17-15. Trinity College was the
last adversary of the day. They handed
the team a 15-10 and 15-10 defeat.
Coach Sadewater made no excuses
for the team, but she did point out the
adjustments which the team was
forced to make. "This was our ﬁrst
overnight and our first real road trip.

We hadn’t really been in tournament
mode yet. it is rare to have our first
away toumamentsoiateinto the sea-
son.”

Sadewater added that even though
the weekend’s activities did not help
in the win/loss department, the trip
was a learning experience for the
whole team. “We did not play badly,
and now I think we know what to
expect. We’ll be able to prepare bet-
ter for the next tournaments now that
we’ve got one out of the way.“

Grinnell continued its excellent
serving throughout the tournament
In the Lake Forest game, 96 percent
of the serves were good. In the Uni—
versity of Chicago game, 93 percent
of the serves found their mark. Top
serving performances for the [Dumar
ment went to Susan Egbert who was
20-20. Mona Babauta served 27-28.
and Jocelyn Keough was 2425.

The Pioneers take to the road to
play Illinois College Friday night,
and compete in Saturday’s Illinois
College Invitational.

minutes of the final quarter, Martin
Grin scored the Pioneers' ﬁnal touch-
down of the day on a onc»yard run.

Defensively, Grinnell was led by
linebacker Lee Kraemer and
comerback Ty McGuire. Kraemer
recorded fifteen tackles while
McGuire contributed eight tackles,
and intercepted two passes. McGuire
was also instrumental in breaking up
three Kohawk pass attempts.

“We will wipe this game off our
memory and concentrate on the beat-
ing Knox," said Wallace.

The Pioneers take on Knox Col—

Wartburg won the meet with 23
points, followed by St. Benedict with
41 points. and St. Thomas with 43

field of twelve northern teams.
Grinnell finished eighth with 211
points.

Junior co-caplain Jessica Henry
led the team witha 19th place ﬁnish,
trimming l2 seconds off her personal
best time of the year. She was fol-
lowed within forty seconds by fellow
Skull Crushers Sandra Robinson,

ﬁnished SOIh, Slst, and 53rd respec-
tively,Roundingoutthetop sevenfor
the Pioneers were Nancy Kaiser in
64th, Amy Harris in 67th, and Jen—
nifer J acobsen in 73rd.

Coach Evelyn Freeman said that
Megan Killmer and Mila Dever tan
mpecially well, taking over 20 sec-
onds off their previous best times.

Henry said thatshe really enjoyed
running on the narrow trails as it was
very scenic and quite different than
mnning on golf courses

Freeman said that although the
team really enjoyed the course, the
nature of running on trails made it

difﬁcultfor the team tocarry outtheir
focus of the previous week on stick-
ing togethen

She said, “On the trails, runners
had to ntn two abreast. lt made it
difﬁcult topass people. We could not
see farenoughaheadto ﬁnd thepacks
we usually mn with. There was a lot
of contact for the ﬁrst 400 meters as
peoplefoughtt‘orposition,something
we are not used to." These conditions
made it hard for the team to stay
together, Freeman said.

The nature of the race may have
contributed to an injury to Grinnell’s
number one runner on the team, Jill
Cetina, as she was knocked in the
back of the knee. Cetina ﬁnished the
race with an inflammed knee.

Freeman said she was pleasantly
surprised at the time improvements
on the learn since the meet followed
the team's hardest week of training at
this juncture in the season.

One explanation for the ﬁne team

self-confidence to overcome any
tiredness they might have felt. Bor-

Henry hastened to add, “We're
not cocky at all , we just like to have
a good time. Believe it or not, this is
