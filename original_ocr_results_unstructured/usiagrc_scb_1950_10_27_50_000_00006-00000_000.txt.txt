."A professor who repeats the
same old lectures year after
year has all the-excitement of
a lirst. class cemetery" These
are the words ot Dr. Joseph
Dunner (pol. s ) who spoke
at the second .llccollege convoe
cation in Darby gym Thursday
morning His most recent Eur-
opean lecture tour was in part,
an effort to avoid such stagna-
tion and {'to seek rejuvenation,”
the professor Said. Speaking of
retirement age for professors,
he suggests that ”some should
have been retired ‘beiorc they
were burn," whereas others
have done excellent jobs of
teaching long after retirement
age. . 1

Dr. Dunner elected to speak
on, three of the cities he visited
this summer because )of the
rich contributions they have
made to western culture. In
Jerusalem he was especially
impressed by the holy places
of the old city under Arab acle
ministration, and the modern
Jerusalem which is the capital,
of the Jewish state of Israel.
He reminded his audience that’
it was the prophet of old who
developed in this setting thei
concept of brotherhood and
preached against “bigotry, pre-
judicet and injustice." v
- Athens. he appraised as haVe
ing contributed the practice of
"direct democracy" which is
still in operation in many of
the New England states today.
Athens. he said, was the ”ﬁrst
civilization of individualism,”
rand withstood the subversive
activities of Sparta, “the come
munist police state next door."

He traced briefly the contric,
butions of Rome to our present
civilization, namely law and
jurisprudence, the doctrine of
private rights, the concept of
the state as a legal entity. The
Romans knew, he said, that
“might without right led to de»‘
struction," and correspondingly,l
“right without inigh't led to
anarchy.” l
