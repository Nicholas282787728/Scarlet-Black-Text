(From Grinnell Herald.)

Miss Ruby Iieldcr, tcnor, oi the
School ol Music faculty, wrote her
lame high in Gl'llmell's musical hall
of time by her recital in Herrick cha-
pel last Friday evening. The almost
capacity audience which heard her
was delighted and all comment on her
performance has been in Superlatives
of praise. Few singers who come to
Grinnell, even from out or town, score
a more instantaneous success than did
Miss Helder on Friday evening.

Miss Heldcr's voice, heard by many
in the audience- for the first time, is of
pure tenor quality, well placed, ex:
pressive and under perfect command.
it possesses a remarkably musical
quality. Her enunciation is a constant
delight and her interpretation. always
effective, is often dramatic in its ins
tensity. On two occasions, Miss Hela
der played her own accompaniments
for encores and proved her-sell also an
accomplished pianist. On most oi the
numbers, however, the accompanr
meilts were efiectively played by liirs.
Alma Fuller Pierce.

bliss Helder presented an unusually
attractive program However, for
many the group of Old English songs
which opened the program set the high
water mark, especially when one in-
cludes the encore, a charmingly- unaf-
fected rendering ct "diary oz Argyle,"
an old Scotch song. Two numbers of
this group, “Chel'l'y Ripe" and “I've
Been Roaming," both by Horn. were
very choice. ‘

A sympathetic rendition of Beethav-
en’s “Adelaide" was the feature or the
second group which also included
“Odol'zlvzt L'April,“ by Parrcli and
“Mattinata” by Tosti, "Unless," by
Luigi Corracicla was the encore.

‘Thl'ee French songs, specially nos
table on account or blassenet's bcauti-

tui Elegie followed, and were cal-dials
ly cucored. The audience was reward-
ed by another Massenet number, ”Ouv»
re tes yeux hleus."

Miss Helder offered a delightful con—
trast in her next group, which included
tour of the modernized Indian melo-
dies with which the girls glce club has
made Gl'iunell people tamiliar. The
group included two Cadman numbers,
“Call Me No More" and "0 Moon Upon
'ihe Water," "To a Messenger," by La
Forge, and "Onaway Awalrc Beloved"
by Coleridges’l‘aylor. The applause
was insistent and Miss Helder delight-
zd everybody by singing "From the
Land ol the Sky Blue Water," by Cad-
man.

"Lend Me Your Aid," by Gounod, was
an impressive closing number, and tor
her last encore Miss Heldcr sang
“Temple Bells" from "Indian Love
Lyrics" by Amy Woodiord Finden.

Miss Holder was most cordially re-
ceived on eveiy appearance. Her
stage presence was pleasing and a
dainty evening gown, which it may in-
terest thc ladies to lmow was designed
by Lucille, was a delight to the eye.

Crinnell people will hope to hear
Miss Holder again soon. She will al-
ways be assured of a cordial recaps
lion.

Leo Ccssell, '10, is expected to at»
l' e from Chicago. to spend Thanks-
giving with Crinnell friends.

Moines, 13 Con idcred As
Possible Successor.

William C. \chlmcu may bc baolt
to Griiinell ne. year should he be
physically able. Just beiore the Coach
left he said he received such a propo-
sition that he could not turn it down
it he would be in a fit physical condi-
lion.

It is almost certain that a Minue-
sota man will be obtained, if possible.
The team next year is composed or
men who have had two )‘eal‘s' tutelage
under the Minnesota method. For this
reason it would be inexpcdicnt to get
any one else other than a Minnesota
exponent.

If McAllllon should return it is not
at all improbable that he will have iiu
able assistant. If this is the case Sol-
eiu may be the assistant. Yesterday's
Des Moines Register printed the [ole
lowing article on the situation:

“Grinnell College’s 1917 tootball
coach \\ ill be William U. )chlinon or
Oscar Solcm. This statement was
made Vestel‘duy by a Giiriiicll alumnus,
who is close to the “labs of the Col-
lege, and who brought word to Des
Molncs that Coach McAlmCu has re-
considered his action in resigning and
has promised to return to the scarlet
and black institution next [all ii his
health improves.

“In the event that )chlmott is un-
ahlc to return the place probably will
be orlered to Oscar solciii, the East
Dos )lollles coach, who was a team-
niate of lchlmou, and who teaches the
same brand or football. Grinnellians
who invor Solcni, say that lie is best
mm! to take charge, and could do so
without disrupting the lootball organ-
ization in the least.

“Salem has been offered the coach-
ing job at East High (or next season.
but has not accepted it deﬁnitely, c
ccpt to state that he will coach East
High if he handles n high school team
next year."

pressing the appreciation of the work
which thc Freshman team has done

outside games {or them, but when all
the plans tell through, the Board of

The Grinncll debating teams this
year will seek honors in Colorado.

which appear on this schedule are,
Colorado, Beloit, Coe, and Cornell c01-

in all the debates.

On the evening of February 15, Grin—
nell debate Colorado College at 00104
rado Springs. The local negative
team, according to present arrange-
ments, will meet their affirmative team
there. This is the ﬁrst. contract to be
made with Colorado, but it seems a
much better System than has herew-
fore been used. It is hoped next. year
that, by means of this debate, a quad-
rangle debate can he arranged be-
tween most of the Harvard Exchange
schools. Gl'innell has had relations
with Colorado, Calleton, Knox, and
Boloit, but has never been able to get
them all together on the sftmc ques-
tion.

Single 0r built

Beloit will meet Gl'llmell on the
home floor sometime in February.
Whether this will be a single or dual
cannot as yet be ascertained. “This
debate will be the lust one to be held
in the new Recitation Building. The
team that meets Belolt here will be
the team to make the Colorado trip.

This will be an improvement over
the system or last ycar when the same
team appeared twice on the local plat-
form. By the present arrangement
both teams can be seen in action by
Grinncll students.
