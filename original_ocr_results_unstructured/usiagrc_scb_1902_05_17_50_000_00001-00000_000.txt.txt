GRINNELL WINS MEET.

Immense Crowd in Attendance.7Every
Event Holly ContestediMeet a
Success in Every Way.

The seventh annual ﬁeld meet
of the Iowa State High School
Athletic Asaociation, which was
held at Ward Field yesterday, was
one of the most successful in the
history oftheassociation. Twenty-
two schools had entered teams and
the majority were present with
men taking part in nearly every
event. The day was an excellent
one for track athletics. The rain
of the night before made a hard,
ﬁrm track and the bright sunshine
following made an ideal day for
warming up and loosening out.
Hundreds of visitors were in town,
Des Moines claiming the largest
portion. So great was the crowd
at the meet that the grandestand
and bleachers at Ward Field were
unable to accomodate them arid'a’
second section of bleachers had to
be erected north oi the grand
stand,

A fairssized crowd was in at»
tendance at the preliminaries in
thelnorning. All of the trial heats
'were well contested and gave as
surance that the meet ofthe after—
noon was to be a most exciting
one. The business houses did not
close for the afternoon meet as
was hoped they would, but the
majority of the business men were
in attendance nevertheless. Music
was furnished in the afternoon
by the Grinnell Citizens Band.
Grinnell demonstrated the beneﬁt
received by training under Jack
Watson, as she won the majority
ofthe pointsinthe dashes,distance
runs and hurdles, winning the
meet by 40 points, 16 more than
her nearest rivals could count up.
Among the men competing were
many who gave promise of being
great athletes with proper trains
ing. Thestatehighschoolrecords
were broken in the hammer throw,
pole vault and high jump. In
many respects the records made
compare favorably with those
made at the college meets at Des
Moines.

One pleasant feature of the
afternoon's sport is the fact that
there were no accidents to mar the
enjoymentoftheaccasion. Apro~
test was made after the two mile
bicycle by East Des Moines and

 

l—larlan.because the referee s pistol
missed ﬁre and the riders did not
receive the customary warning al
thebeginningotthelastlap. The
protest was not allowed and the
result ofthe racestood. Tlle high
hurdles resulted in a tie between
Grifﬁth of West Des Moines and
G, Hodgdon of Grinnell, and
were run off in an extra heat be-
tween thc two at the close of the
meet. This was one ofthe prets
tiest events of the afternoon. both
men clearing the hurdles together
up to the last one, where Hodgdon
lost his stride and fell over the
hurdle, losing the race. The meet
was run off in quick time, thanks
to the eFﬁcient management pro»
vided.

tendered the visitors in the men's
gymnasium, The building was
handsomely decorated with scar~
let'and black and was thronged
with people untilafterthe banquet

STATE MEET PLANS.

Arrangements Being Made ror Running
olfrhc Meet Easily and
Quickly.

Preparations for the state meet
are nearing completion. The men
to whose efforts the success of last
year’s meet was largely due have
been secured to ofﬁciate this year.
Every detail is being arranged so
that there will be no hitch in pull-
ing offthe meet. The games com-
mittee declare that the meet will
not occupy over three hours and
means that there will be no long
waits between events. The meet
will be held at the fair grounds in
Des Moines and seats in thegrand~
stand havebeenreserved and these
are being distributed among the
schools, The Grinnell section is
right opposite the tape and seats
in this part are on sale at R, R.
Rust's, These must be reserved
before next Wednesday. After
that date they will be on sale at
Des Moines only.

Manager Chase of the track
team has secured a rate of 51.50.
A special train will be used to car-
ry the crowds from Iowa City and
Grinnell to Des Moines on that
day. Present indications point to
a large attendance from all the
colleges. This is due to the fact
that the result of the meet is in
doubt and each of the big schools
will send large delegations to ens
courage their men, while in the
case of the smaller schools, the
number ot points secured in the
meet will determine whether or
not they will continue as members
of the State Athletic Association.
Everything taken into considera
tion, there can be no doubt that
this year's meet will be the best
and most largely attended of any
ever held.

Although Grinnell’s prospects
are not as bright as they might
appear. yet next Friday is the
day to show the loyalty of the
students to the track team and an
appreciation of the strenuous et-
forts which the management at
the Association have put forward
in planing a successful meet.

MEETING OF DELEGATES.

The representatives of the state
high school athletic association
met this morning in Institute Hall
and made arrangements for the

 

meet next year, elected ofﬁcers
and transacted other business. It
was voted to hold the meet at
Grinnell again nextyear. though
Des Moines made a strong bid for
the meet. This is very satis-
factory to the management of
Grinnell’s team as it is somewhat
in the nature of a compliment to
tile complete arrangements and
the rapidity with which the meet
yesterday was run off. it is prac-
tically admitted that nowhere in
the state can the high schools be
given such arrangements and ac-
comodations as at Grinnell. The
gymnasium here, the track, ex-
perience in handling meets are un-
excelled and the railroad Con-
nections are inferior only to those
of Des Moines.

The ofﬁcers elected were, H, D.
Carson of East Des Moines, Presi-
dent; Vincent of Davenport, Vicea
President;Craig,West Des Moines,
Treasurer, and the Secretaryship
goes to Grinnell, though who the
incumbentwillbeisnotyetsettledr
The executive committee will
consist of Don Miles of Eldora,
Geo. Allen of Harlan; B. D.
Hedges of Marengo, and Charles
Campbell, the retiring secretary.
of Council Bluffs. The advisory
board for next year will be l’rof.
T. H. Ziegler of Grinnell, Prof.
Guthrie of West Des Moines. and
Prof. Miller of Council Bluffs.

Various other matters received
some attention but no other busi-
ness of much importance was
done. The representatives of the
high schools are well pleased with
the success of the meet this year
and are hoping to make the meet

next year even a greater success.
