I’OLITICAL ISI’ECULATIONS

Ths elections have passed leaving
the more or less blase college mind
unruffied, with perhaps the row ex—
Captions of the men and Women who
cast their ﬁrst vote and ﬁnd that i
did not go for the winning candidate.
The college student shows 2. tendency
to ignore oolitics, and is likely to ails-
wer when a mention of a congress—
man is made, “Oh, no holds office two
year, and receives a salary of $7500
a year." Which goes to prove that
college men study Political Science.
But this is not intended to be a serr
mon, nor does it necessarily apply to
everyone, but rather it serves to give‘
an introduction to commants on the
results of the election last Tuesday.

The most significant‘iadt ot the,
elections was the big gain in Congress
made by the democratic party. The
republican majority in the senate
dropped from 24 to 13} While the re-I
publicnn majority in the house drop—-
ped even more, when the democrats
gained 71 new members. Only sixteen
more scats would give the democrats
a maioruy there.

The republican working majority is
far from safe in either the sonata or
the house. The sc-c'alied independent‘
republicans cannot be counted on in
strict party legislation. Senators
Sarah, Frazier, Smoot and others or.
the independent group are liable to'
cut this majority frequently. Brook—
hart, Iowa's new senator, is another
independent republican who will prob-
ably become a mcmher of this group.

Political experts have been busy
doping out these rcsults the past week
to mean various things. Opponentsi
or the Harding administration say,
that it Is the baodw ng upon the,
wall. Supporters of Harding say that;
it is not a repudiation of Harding, but
that the decrease in the rejublican
majority is partially doc to other cir—
cumsthnces, such as the prohibition
question and various state issues.
But Whatever the Causes, [his election
is far from being an endorsement or
Harding and “normalcy".

group will be absent when the new

two )‘efu‘s ago.

The senatorial election in lowa has
furnished the political dopesiers withA
plenty of malarial for proiound spec-’
ulatlou. Brookhart was elected, not on
[he l‘cpulillczm platform, but. on his‘
Own personal platform, which only ‘
partially agi-ocd with that or his par-J
ty. Brookhart knew how to appeal to
the dissatisfied elements among thel
farmer and laboring groups. and it i
quite safe (0 say, among many of the

.very evenly matched.

Many complaints were made against
Brookhart for his rciusai to follow out
the program arranged ior him by the
party bosses. but Brookhart did not
favor the party platform in iLs on-
tirctr, and unlike most candidates, ho
was not afraid to announce his dis-
agrccmcnt it is iuicrcstiug to note
that Brookhart did not hesitate to sup-
port many of the same things for
which the democrats stood, but stood
for what he believed to bc right. This
action was in direct opposition to the
old fiction that repulican and demo-
crat must oppose each other on cvcry
issuc; the old policy at first come,
ﬁrsL served in getting the better side
outlic issues. Tile essence at the whole
thing is that democrat and republican
can support many of the same pollv
cics and still be consistant in polio,

Taken as a whole, the election was
in direct refutation to the reactionar—
ies who stand for the old order with
little progressive legislation. The rc-
publican party has seen this, and has
announced a much more progressive
program for the next years. The coun-
try will not hear much or “normalcy"
the next two‘yeztrs, but can expect
more progressive politics to develop
in both of the larger political parties.
