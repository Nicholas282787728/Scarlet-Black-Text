Mad Dogs favored in
home Conference meet

By Steve Clem

The rewards for months of gru-
eling workouts will begin to shine
brightly as the season nears its
conclusion for the Mad Dogs. The
bald pack of dogs began the early
events of the Midwest Conference
Men‘sConference Championships
last night in theP.E.C. pool. Coach
Ray Obermiller is cautiously opti-
mlSuC about the meet's possible
outcome. “I don't think we‘ll have
too many problems, but I know
better than to go inlo‘a suuation
taking it for granted," said
Obem-liller.

The men's swim learn has won
13 of die last 15 conference chamr
pionships,with thcexception ofthe
1978 and 1987 meets. In the last
three contests, the men have set
conference scoring records, culmiv
nating last year with an awesome
734 points. “1 don'tthink wewill be
able to repeal last year‘s perforr
mance.Wejustdon‘thavethedepth
in this squad,“ said Obcrmiller.

Obermtller also pointed out that
the team is still hindered by various
factors.0bennillcrstressedthatthe
Mad Dogs “are not as healthy” as
past years ,adding “...but I think
we should do okay.”

The Mad Dogs can expect the
fiercest competition from Coe and

Lake Forest. “Coo has a tull squad
of 19 swimmers. and they could

give us a very good run,” said
Obermiller. Lake Forest has tradi-
tionally been the toughest oppo-
nent for the Mad Dogs.

Obermiller believes thatstudents
should make thetrway to the P.E.C.
pool because of the fast times he
expects will be swum. Obermiller
said “The Way We have the pool set
up right now, it is an extremely fast
pool. i expect that half of the pool
records and half of the conference
records should be broken."

The conference meet is also the
last chance for the Mad Dogs to
qualify for the national meet, to be
held at Kenyon College tltls year.
”We have the poSSlbtllty to qualify
for nationals in up to it events.
which would be quite an accom-
plishment,“ Obcrmiller stated,

Obcrmtller hopes that many
students wtll turn out to e an
exciting meet with the possibility
otextremely fasttimes.“You don’t
get a chance to see the conference
meet that often. and it would be
great to have the support for these
guys.“ Obermiller said. The meet
began last night. with the remain-
ing competition taking place today
and tomorrow, Preliminary events
will be swum at 10:00 each mom-
ing, with ﬁnals taking place at6:00
tonight, and 4:00 tomorrow after
noon. If you have a chance, go see
the clean-shaven Mad Dogs in ac-
tion at the P.E.C. pool.
