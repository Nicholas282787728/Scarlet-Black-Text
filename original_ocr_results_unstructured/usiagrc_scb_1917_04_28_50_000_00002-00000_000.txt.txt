Ii tor no other reason than to show
that the scientists cl Iowa are live
men and (ILL: to be recitoned with as
important laciors in modern lilc, the
thirtiuii -st annual meeting or the
Iowa Academy of Science has been

worth while. ‘

It has bmuglii, a lesson home to
Gi'inuell. It has .hown this institu-
tion that scientiﬁc men are the only

' ones who are constructiie, the only
ones who inane discoveries and who
hiu‘ld up new things. They are the
ones who are pushing the world and
airing its progress a stability that is
worth while. Others who make dis-
coveries and inventions do so by hair
penstancc, anti hence are not true
ot their own intelligence.

Every paper piesented yesterday
and today was constructive. It eame
as the result ot well directed client
and explained something new in the
scientiﬁc world. It is a mistortune
that the whole college could not have
attended the meetings to become ace
quainteti with the scientinc doings in
our own state of Iowa and to gain a‘
closer sympathy with the creative, or
scientiﬁc, type of mind.

til-innell has rejoiced in entertain-
in; the leading scientists of the state.
In a .certain sense we are sorry that
they will meet elsewhere next year.
Would that they could come here
again: But we can lorget our selnsh‘
desires when we think or now won—‘
deiliilly poweirul has been the scien-‘
tine spiiit \anh the lowa Academy
meetings have instilled in Grinncili

 

lewa, and the nation ii e thanlt themi :

in our humble way for it.
