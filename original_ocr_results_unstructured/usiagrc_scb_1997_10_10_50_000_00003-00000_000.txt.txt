A Foolish Consistency Tales

BY IVY CHANG
Columnist

fragments from a dialogue that at:-
iualiy took place in a room not un-
like the Forum Coffccllnusc at a
school less “Grlrttlcll-Iikc" than
you 'd think (thoughts in italics):

trustee: “I’ve seen this issue go full
circle now [between my lime here as
a student (Grinnell grad 1962) and
now as a trustee}. When I went here,
the black and the while students went
to class together, ate in thc'dining
halls together, and lived in the domis
together and there weren‘t any issues.
Well.,.I didn’t think there were any
issues then, but I found out later [af-
ter actually talking to one of the
blacks]...but, anyway, my poinl is,
there wasn’t any segregation then
and that was considered good. [don't
understand why everybody wants to
segregate themselves now."

me: WHAT???J!! What the heck is
he talking about.7 Why is this man
talking about civil rights when the
rest of us are talking about
multicultural space?

“Multicultural space isn’t aboutseg—,
regation. It’s about having a perma-
nent place on campus where students
of color can have adequate space [in
which to have ofﬁces, run resource
centers and libraries, have kitchens,
hold meetings, and celebrate their
respective cultures], I'm still won-
dering why this is even an issue on
this supposedly very progressive
campus. Most schools already have
Multicultural Centers and have had
them for years."

trustee: “Well, you knew we didn't
have a Multicultural Center and
you’re here, aren‘t you?" ,
me: So that implies what? That it
doom '1 so much matter how students

feel a r much as what they will ptil tip
with?

trustee: “We’re looking at how to
raise our ranking [in US News and
World Report]. Now if you can tell
me that all number of schools
outranking us right now have
multicultural centers, then we could
talk about doing something..."

me: my interpretation: Reputation is
oflttnlost importance, This is a busi-
ness we we running, after all.

Am I at the wrong tritslees‘
lutlclldotl7,,.tlle wlong school? I
can 't believe those words just came
out cftiis nioiiiti!

trustee: “Let me ask you this. do you
really think a Multicultural Center
would make that big oil: difference
on campus?"

me: Now, we fun though! we should
build one for the hell of it.

trustee: “Is it an issue that has popu—
larstudent supporl7lmcan,ifwc [the
board of trustees] were to walk
around campus asking people about
space, not that we would do that. but
if we were to, would we ﬁnd a ma
jority of students supporting it?“
me: Let the ark YOU a question.-
when you were considering the ratio.
vation of the math and science build-
ing, did you make sure to consult
humanities majors to see if they ap-
proved? I doubt it; it would have
been illogical. The math and science
building exists for the sole ptirposc
of students who are studying or tak-
ing classes in the tnath and science
departments, However, by beneﬁting
those students, the building benefits
the whole school, whether or not it
has "popular student support. "
Thc same applies to a Multicultural
Center People ofcolor collie to this
campus to the beneﬁt ofevctyone but
themselves, The school gains a di-
verse student body (which, in turn,
boosts rankings), but aﬂers little sitpe
port to these students in return. A
Multicultural Center wottldtiot only
allow students to learn more about
their respective cultures, but to edus
Cate others as well.

trustee: “But if we agree to
multicultural space. the Christian
Coalition is going to want space, and
the Campus Republicans, and every-
one else.,,what are we supposed to
tell them?"

me: You tell them that being a per
son of color is neither an interest, on
extracurricular actiirily, nor a
choice. I! is a reality we are bani
trim. By building multicultural space,
the college would ital only be ac-
knowledging, but actively showing
their support and appreciation of
di/ferent cultures; just as their bill-Ids
ing oft/12 Stonewall Resource Celi-
tet showed their support of gay. les-
bian, bisexual. transgendered stu-
dents. The SRC now guarantees
those students a place to feel wel-
come and space._la be illeniselvcs.
trustee: “Well, supposing we agreed
to it, where would we get the money
to build a Multicultural Center’.l The
budget’s already set. Are you going
to cut it from the faculty salaries? Are
you going to raise tuition? The
money has to come from some-
where..."
me: Um, does the phrase ‘collcgc
with one of the largest endowments
in the country ' sound familiar? How
'bcurfuridrbisiiigl Reminds me ofzi
cartoon 1 saw recently.

Answer: cut spending

Question: How do the trustees re-
spond to a growing endowment?
trustee: “Also, how do you guys feel
about the PEC? It does need to be
renovated, you know. You think stu.
dents would support the building of
a Multicultural Center rather than
updating the PEC? We wouldn’t be
able to do both..."
me: Bullsh *i. Was itjusi tile or did
the rest of the campus see construc-
tion going on in two di/ferent parts
ofthe campustyes, even atthe some
time) less than two weeks ago too?
And what the heck does the PEC
have to do with it? Two slightly dif-
ferent issuer, dontcha think?
“How can you even compare the
two? We already have a PEC. Maybe
not the greatest PEC in the world, but
it‘s adequate. We don’t have ANY
multicultural space."
Nada, zip. zero, nothing, none, ltooo
spaceiin case there was any canfi r
sion about that. I know you have a
tendency to think of the school the
way it was in the ﬁfties and sixties,
’when you went here.‘ Oh! But wait,
there wasn 't a Multicultural Center
on campus back then either Silly me,
What was I thinking. 7

Don’t Ask Me, I m Just a Girl

BY Ltzz WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

All right, so here's the deal,
Grinncll has a couple reputations in
the world. One is for being a bunch
of druggcdrout, alcoholic, bisexual,

, Phish-touring, hacky-sack-playing.
’ incestuous liberals, (You can pro»
mote this stereotype by attending 10/
10/97 tonight!) The other is a bunch
Ufwhining, wannabe ﬂower children
that don’t do drugs or drink and write
a bunch of petitions that don‘t go
anywhere, Now, ask yourselfwhcre
you ﬁt in. l think it’s much better to
have a personality and go a little
crazy, possibly inciting fear and dis~
gust, than doing absolutely nothing
out of fear ofthe implications on the
resiofyour life... And each class that
comes here gets more and more like
the second group, thus tearing
Grinnell away from its liberal routs
(Yes, I know that I. too, looked coils
servalive when I ﬁrst came here and
everything I wore was from the Gap
or J. Crew and I don’t now. Yes, I
know every upperclassman says this
every year. However, I'm putting the
rumors on paper.) Now anyway, I
would much rather have someone
look at me when they know I'm from
Grinnell with some kind of strong
reaction, regardless of what is, than
none whatsoever. I lhink the worst
scenario would be, “Yeah, I knew
this girl from high school that went
to Grinncll, Boy, was she ever bor-
ing, No personality. No spark, She

got really good, grades though, kept
out of trouble... “ You get the idea.
So, my point is that there are many
things that get on my nerves here that
contribute to the disintegration ofthe
first group and the enlargement ofthe
second.

But this is what really gets on my
nerves OK, this IS to the groups on
campus I m really alad that you re
saving some guy in prison in some
third world country or the South or
whatever. Or you’re savmg some
tree in Madagascar. Seriously, I am.
I sign the petitions and stuff. ldon’t
just sign them because I'd feel like a
bitch walking past some socially-
conscious group without signing
them, and I know the guilt will over»
ride me all day if I don’t. I agree
with your issues. I'm in awe that you
can find the lime to have issues and
still stay in this school, However,
realistically, I don't think some peti»
tion from four hundred students in
the middle of bumblefuck (excuse
the phrase, but at least I’m honest)
Iowa will save this person, Yes, I
know spitting in the ocean does
something, but really, not very much
However, I don’t see you guys pick»
ing cans out ofthe garbage or trying
to act locally (Sorry to sound like a
bumpersiicker.)

Ticcs on south campus were cut
down this weak Without the students
being notiﬁed. Because ofmy friend
Kelly, a tree was spared, Now, please
keep in mind that this was the work
ofone person and support from a few
others. These trees have history,
damiiit. There ARE ways of saving
these trees without jeopardizing our
safety and security. However, these
ways did not happen. I’m not say-
ing that I know what these ways are
or that if the administration would
call me in and ask me serious ques-
tions befmc they try to sue me for
slander and promotion of negative
images ofGriiincll College, I could
give answers. Nevertheless, there
ARE ways lo gel around the slaughs
tcr oiun agcrold tree, The tree they
Cul down was oldcl'lhan anyone who

works at or attends this college and
it was Cut down because it creaked

And yes, 1 saw the big, nasty while
worms that crawled out. I know the
tree was rotten. However, a whole
bunch of healthy trees were slaugh-
tered for the creation of the new Fine
Arts building. They could have been
transplanted to south campus. Hell,
they could have replaced that old,
rotten tree Wllh ten healthy trees if
they really wanted to. Or they could
have built the school up so the cam-
pus doesn’t look even more like a
concretejunglc! So what I’m trying
to say, folks, is that you should actu-
ally make a difference and do stuff
here if you are going to take the time
to do stuff for other places. It‘s less
work and it feels good to be able to
see the difference you make.

Why are there pesticides all over the
grass and ﬂowers here? I have seen
many “No Children" signs sincel’ve
been here, particularly around
Steiner and Herrick. The dining hall
food is so terrible for you and the
world at large — why isn’t anyone
complaining about that? They use
pesticiderridden, “Low-grade dog
food" (to quote Rodney Dangerfield
in Caddyshack) to feed us. Well, not
me, but that‘s just because I come
plained so much last year and had a
good draw number for this year.
However, Ido remember feeling sick
after every meal, being malnourished
for the three semesters I was eating
at Quad. trying to get off the meal
plan With a doctor's excuse and be-
ing denied. suffering from severe
hypoglycemic attacks, watching my
friends do the same, having to suffer
panic attacks because of the meal
situations, getting sick more often,
having less energy, and much more.
Like I said last week, I really could
go on about this for a whole S & B
issue. But guess whailf.l All ofthis is
related to diet!

Why isn't anyone ﬁghting this ex
cept the few with serious problems
like idid:7 Why isn‘t anyone asking
the dining hall to get locally-grown
produce and meats? For god‘s sake

So it'sjust me and my dog on a lazy

afternoon in the deer park watching
the rainbow circle bending around
the sun, I am wontlcring why and my
dog is spying for butterﬂies. He is
rewarded first with a lovely little
monarch cutting past his nose. A
snap, a bark and [hen , , a chase,
Snapping through the woods, imme-
diately my dog vanishes, and it is just
me, there to watch the afternoon
fade,

My position IS cross legged, be»
neatli a tree, with a View on tall
meadow grass, and the sound of the
wind rustling through it all. It is a
moment of purity. It is movement,
but stillness 7 it is a moment defi-
ant oftime. Insects ofall colors. sizes
and means oflocomotion pass about
by my legs and cars, their sound
buzzing, distinct in my mind. So
many things happening to make the
scene. Me, withjust one part, and I
don't wantto dominate. So I sit, cross
legged, and am as a rock, still to the
world, and full of the truth of exist-
ence. I am at the will ofthe world.

Meanwhile my dog darts crazily
after the beautiful monarch who in

OPINION

the everyday course of her short life
dashed through air as wind and whim'
directed and now dashes and dives
in hopes of survival. And the dog is
fueled wtth the msh that comes from
power, from controlling what is
beautiful, hoping to study it but more
likely to kill it. Over stumps and be-
low branches in and out ofthe dark-
ness ofcover, life and death goes on,
a spider nabs a ﬂy as the butterﬂy
passes by, a leaf falls lonely from the
tree.

It is hard to believe that anything
else matters, Sitting beneath the tree
I am unable to believe the every day
of my life, I am unable to believe
what I normally believe. I am won-
dering ifI matter. If] sat in the woods
till my bones fed Ihe earth would it
matter? Would the world go on, or is
it mine? I am sitting beneath the tree
and knowing. Knowing that What
comes and goes is here, and my scene
is not as small as some people's, Sur-
rounded by nature's earth, the given
earth, I am certain that I matter, that
my breath is as important as the trees.
that my voice is as necessary as the
birds, that silence is not listening and
knowing ls being in awe.

My dog tires and it becomes the
butterﬂy’s game. Taunting him, lead-
ing him on, the butterﬂy dances
through the air out ofreach andjoy-
ful as before. The dog shouts and
shouts to no avail. then lays down,
making a bed ofthe leaves. The bot
terﬂy lands nearby. perched and
watching. Hours pass and it ﬂies
away and my dog awakens to a beetle
on his nose. The butterﬂy gone from
his mind, he is focused on the new
adventure. He eats the beetle and re-
traces his scent.

From Another World

It is impossible to be alone in the
world. But we can choose the com-
pany we keep. I prefer to be with
animals, animals that don‘t domi»

nate. I prefer the rhythm of oceans .

to the rhythms of machines. Iprefer .,

the sun to the 40 watt. And I prefer.
death to a hospital hookup. At home

in the town, I rarely feel like I mat-i '

tar, but what difference can I make
ifljust run away?

It is hard to believe that the given . ,

world is not the chosen world, that ,i

people should have such a need for .

safety that they would sacrifice
beauty. That the wolf should be im»
pure and the vaccinated child pure.
What horror must have occurred in
the times of our common ancestors

that we should all have taken such .7

different paths. Now we have trav-
eled so far that so few can see the
tracks which mark our journey. I

won’t talk of progress: that word is

for an unbiased mouth.

There is my world and there is my .,

dog‘s world. Iexist in his and he in

mine but neither is the same; pan of ,-

me exists in his world and part ofhim

in mine. I often wonder what story , 3

he would tell. I wonder what life he
is really living. Iwonder what is truly
behind his butterﬂy chase and need
for scent I wonder what my dog
thinks of me.

On a good day I spend most of my
time wondering

It seems like every year that passes, V '

this becomes less and less accept-
able. It is what I need to stay sane.
but like so many people remind me.
it doesn‘t pay the rent.

Sitting cross legged beneath the tree .‘

I cannot believe that I am trespass-

Novel idea, is it not? Why don’t you
all email Dave McConnell, Tom

ideas, Or any ideas. You can make
a difference ifyou do stuffat Grinnell
that WILL affect the rest of the
world. Can you imagine the impact
on the planet (or less thereof) if the
dining hall had organic meats, dairy,
and vegetables? Did you know the
average American eats six pounds of
pesticides a year? Did you know that
food affects your mood, attention
span, sleeping patterns, immune sys
tem, and everything else in your life?

So, again, it's easy to be all p.c. and
save stuff somewhere else, particus
larly third world nations. However,
please keep in mind that you are not
a memberofthis said nation. If you
really want to make a difference,
boycott products from this third
world nation and write a letter to the
company or government saying why
you are boycotting. Or even come
panies in the great, old USA. (Block.
buster, Pepsi, Coca Cola, Nike, and
more.) This will make much more
of a difference. It's sad to say but
your dollar means more politically
than being one ofa few hundred stu—
dents on a petition. Also, you are
only one in six billion or so in the
world. In Grinnell, you are one in
almost 1300. Hence, your voice
means much, much more, And, m.
member, our school can be just as
terrible as the rest ofthe world, Our
environment is messed up here too.
And. of course, never allow yourself
to be boring, It makes me look bad
when I leave,

Technicolor Penguins

Recently. I, along with a group of
fellow seniors, took the ofﬁcially
proctored practice Real Life Denial
Test, also known as the GRE. For
those of you unfamiliar with the
term, the GRE is the Graduate
Record Examination, a key deters
miner of whether or not you will be
able to spend two to twenty more
years sequestered in computer labs
writing papers in fonts such as cou-
rier. As we all know, it was LB.
Grinnell, the founder oflhis ﬁne in-
stitution, who gave the noble cry,
“Give me liberty, or give the grad
school!" Grinncllians, known for
their enterprising and adventuresome
spirits, of course fear the former and
embrace the latter.

Anyway, I digress. As I said before.
I took a practice test in which I
learned and important fact: four years
and $90,000 have not made me much
smarter. The GRE, according to im-
portant and reliable sources such as
the Kaplan Proﬁt Machine, suggest
that the GRE accurately reﬂects all
the knowledge that I have acquired
at college. Those silly Gnnnell pro.
fcssors would have us believe that it
is important to think critically, write
thoughtfully, and discuss meaning-
fully, because the world cannot be
easily split into black and White di-
chotomies, Unfortunately, as I dis-

covered while taking the test, the real
world is actually multiple choice.
Even the scores I received a week
later were divided into two conve.»
nierit categories: 1. “Ha Ha! We spit
on your scores! Unless you take our
all—inclusive $3,000 program, you
will wither away in uneducated mis-
ery," and 2..“Drat! You are a genius."
I knew when the woman working at
the Career Development office

handed back my scores 7 I hesitate _

to say “guffawing” 4 in a respect-
ful and conﬁdential manner, that I
probably would need to do some
work before the real test date arrived.

However, since I can barely afford ‘ ‘

to make photocopies for my reserve

readings, let alone drop a few thou- . =

sand dollars for a crash course on
brain enhancement, I came up with
my own convenient and relevant sys-
tem to ensure higher scores:
Analogy: France is to Eiffel Tower
as Grinnell College is to: A. Super

heroes in the dining hall B. Chicken -

Patty Parmesan C. Streaking at Har-
ris D. Zirkle

Quantitative: A student, traveling
from south campus to her classes on
a warm October afternoon, encoun~
ters a train. Assuming that the train
is traveling at 5 miles per hour, and
the student's class begins in three
minutes, how many cars does the
train have? A. 10 B. 12 C. 36,535
D. Impossible k this situation only

occurs in the dead of winter when it ,

is 43 degrees below zero.

Analytical: A student wishes to drop
a course after the ofﬁcial drop dead~
line. For this, she must present to the
registrar the signatures of her adviser,
her professor, and her mother, as well
as a pint of blood. If the blood drive
occurs only on Thursday, and her
professor can only be found in alter-
nate realities, who should she try to
contact ﬁrst? A. Her mother B. The
Registrar C. The Red Cross. D. None
