McKee, Wyly

by David Crow

Christopher McKee is the new
Chief Librarian, and MaryGae Wyly
is the new Associate Librarian Mr.
McKee is new to Grinnell, coming
here from the University of Mir
chigan at Edwardsville, while Mrs.
Wyly is already well known, having
been at Grinnell since 1968.

McKee spent 10 years at the Un-
iversity of Mchigan, first as Soc-
ial Science Librarian and later as
Assistant Director. Previously he
had Worked at Washington and Lee
University, also as Social Science
Librarian.

Mr. McKee’s main project this
year is to expand the capabilities
of the library‘s Microtext facilis
ties. Equipment will be made avails
able for different types of mini-
aturized publications andfor making
photostatic copies directly from the
Microfilm.

The Microtext installation has been
moved downstairs into space created
by the opening oi the administrative
offices in Nollen House, formerly
White House. only Career Services
is left in Hurling Basement, and
they are scheduled to leave by
next year.

In addition to the Microfilm fa-
cilities, Mr. McKee plans to put
more book stacks down in the bases
ment, to bring more government
documents from the Downtown Dfs
fice Building, and, in time, to move
the library’s catalog, periodical, and
ordering departments downstairs.
More space will be created byl'nOVr
ing some little-used periodicals
downtown.

Asked about the difference be
tween 3 large University and Grin-
nell. he suggested that it was not so
great as one might think, He gave
as an example the University o_l
Michigan, 500,000 volumes, Of that,

he said, about l50,000 were in var-
ious areas where Grinnell either
does not have programs, or where
they are not as large, such as Bus-
iness Administration or Education

Approximately 350,000 volumes,
then, are comparable to Grinnell's
areas of coverage.

This compares to Burling's 200,
000 odd volumes. He added tllat
Burling Library had a reasonable
capacity oi 300,000, and praised
his predecessors for their work
in building the library.

On the question We all end up
asking ourselves, “Why Grinnell7",
Mr. McKee's comments suggested
that Grinnell’s faculty recruitment
may be almost as good. He Said that
the size did appeal to him, to be
in what he termed “A place on a
human scale.”

When he came for his interview,
he was impressed with the fact
that he actually met students, and
the professionalism of it all. He
told ofone nationally famous school,
which he asked remain nalneless,

consisted of viewing camping trui—

Pub Vote NexlTuesdoy

A student opinion poll to deter
mine the extent of support for the
proposed ‘pub' on campus will be
conducted by the SGA Election Board
on Tuesday, September 26, accord
ing to the Subcommittee on Face
ilities KL Food Service.

Before delegating the matter for
development to the Subcommittee,
the Committee on Student Services
established certain basic elements
to be included in the proposal. Among
these are that the ‘pub’ would have
a coffeehouse type of atmosphere
with some low-key entertainment.
It would operate to contribute to the
general student-faculty life of the
college community as a whole, and
would be both complementary and an
alternative to other campus activ-
ities (films, dances etc). The ‘pub'
would serve beer and nonalcoholic
beverages (and perhaps snacks);
however, other alcoholic and other
beverages to he sold will be des
termined by a) suitability to Dur-
poses oi the ‘pub’, 13) what the

Counseling Concerns:
Kimbo Addresses Faculty

by Don Dagenais

The newly-expanded Career Ser-
vices Oifice must cooperate with
members of the Grinnell faculty in
gathering information concerning
graduate schools and lob opportune
ities in order to lie of maximum
service to the students, Dennolstu-
dent Affairs Conney Kimbo told the
faculty at the faculty meeting last
Monday afternoon

The Career Services office is “not
the sole counseling serVice atGrin-
nell," Kimbo advised the faculty,
“and we must pool our resources
to provide the best career service
counseling for the students." The
Office Will also need facility help,
he said, in compiling statistics con-
cerning the numbers ofGl‘innellgrae
(luates who go to graduate schools
and the numbers who find Jobs.

“Students want to know what they
can do with a Hot. degree,” Kimbo
said, The faculty may have more
information on job opportunities for
Ii student with a degree in Phil-
osuplly. ior example, than does the
Career Services Office.

President Glenn Leggett noted that
ill the 1950's and 1960's most place-
merit activity at the college focused
on applications to graduate schools
and thus was handled largely by the
departments “in the last few years,
however, it has become apparent that
students demand and need more ups
tions about their career plans "
Because of the present job situation
and “economic doldrums in the mar-
ketplace," he said, it is important
that students “have second and third
choices about a career,”

The trouble, Leggett noted, is that
"there is no small liberal arts col-
lege that is following along on this
type of thing that we can use as a
model " Both Leggett and Kimbo ap~

pealed to the iaculty to cooperate
with the Career Services Office in
developing its new role,

Leggett also expressed concern
over the increased attrition rate at
the college, and noted that “part oi
it is due to the fact that students
are disenchanted with tile traditional
undergraduate liberal arts degree."
Career counseling will, he feels,
find out exactly how widespread the
disenchantment is,

“The college does want to be on
guard, however, that it not appear
to guarantee students that When they
get out oi here they will find the
kind of career they want.”

in other business, DeanJoseph Wrtll
reviewed procedures for student

evaluation of instructors and the CO},
lege’s established system for pro»
mating professors. The student
evaluations would not be used for
the most recent appointments, he

noted, because "there is no basis [or
comparison,” and the evaluations
also will not determine any action
concerning promotions

The iaculty passed unanimously a
proposal to allow Mathematics 134R,
a Computer Programming Work-
shop, to be graded on a Credit/No
Entry basis.

Professor of Religious Studies Ho—
ward Burkle reminded the faculty
that suggestions are welcome for
students who may be eligible for
Danforth Fellowships The Danforth
Foundation, he said, has givenGrine
nell permission to nominate two cur-
rent Grinnell students and one re-
cent graduate for the Fellowships,
which are used to defray graduate
school expenses for students whoins
tend to enter careers in university
or college teaching, The nominations
must be submitted by November 1.

Openings for three sub-committees of the student Services Committee

tions for each of the two openings on the Forum, Health Service, and
Facilities and Food Service SubeCommlttees should be taken to the Stus
dent Coordinator’s office or placed in the SGA mailbox no later than

4 pm Wednesday, September 27.

Applications for a third Assistant Student Coordinator’s position should
be submitted to the Coordinator’s Office or SGA mailbox no later than

4:00 p.m. rrlday, September 29.

Plight Of Small Farmers ls ISPIRG Concern

picting a 30% increase in iood prom
ductivity in the years 195071970,
farmers have received $800 million
less ill net income over the same
time period,

The plight of the small farmer was
of particular concern to many wite
llcsses. Weber questioned Whether
“ . .tne federal government proe
grams during the last 40 years. . .
helped to maintain a family farm,
or have they forced him off the
farm? I think they have practically
forced him off." Goeppinger, her
lievlllg encouragement for thesmall
farmer is in the interest of “the
country as a Whole,” called for
” . .Ecoliomic rescue of the fam-
ily farmer who lives on the land,
loves it, cares for it.”

The issue of urban migration, a
movement of over 25 million people
from rural areas to Cities since
1945, also received attention "Stop
looking at the problems of agrie
culture as agricultural problems,
tlley‘re social problems,” emphas
sizes Hai‘kin

"What are the social costs in rural
areas as people move out: what are
the social costs in urban areas as
people move in?”, asked Weber,
“To really come to grips with the
problems we are lacing in n sciene
tific and technological age, how
should we use our knowledge and the
capabilities we have""
