A 10 year development pro-
gram designed to make Grill-
llell college “the most dis
tillgllislled college of lilleral
arts in the middle west,” was
approved by the Board of
Trustees at their meeting
here Saturday.

The program will be financ-
ed by a campaign for three

dollars, which \ ’ll be launch,
ed early next year.

It will include: the construction
of $300,000 physical education and
rccreatioiial centers, fine arts cen-
ter, a. new science building, the
enlargement of library facilities,
and enlargement and heautificua
tion of Herrick chapel.

Also discussed was the increas-
ing of college endowments by one
mid one-halt million dollers to in-
sure adequate income to the col-
lege.

The trustees also voted to her
gin construction on the first part
of the proposed physical educa-
tion and recreational center. The
first unit, to be built near the
site of the present men’s gym-
includc a men’s
physical educational unit, with

ity of 1500 and other physical
educational facilities for men,
Cost of Gym.

proximately $100,000 dollars, and.
will be the first unit of the pro-
posed $400,000 physical educa—
tional and recreational center
which is included as part of the
construction work proposed in the
Lenryear plan.

The decision of the trustees to
revert to the original building plan
was made after they had carefully
considered a petition submitted
by die Grillnell student body ask-
ing that the second proposal of
a unit to added to the present
Stadium wall be abandoned in
favor of building one unit of the
ol ginolly planned structure.
Fine Arts Building.

The fine arts center and science
building- will be construotcol to
eliminate the physical handicaps
under which these departments
have been forced to Work, Pres.
Samuel N. Stevens said.

in speaking of the plan to
enlarge and beautify Herrick
chapel, Dr. Stevens said, "The
trustees are interested in the
religious life of Griiiuell students,
and they -pcnt a great deal of
time deciding ways to make
religion have a deeper meaning-
to the students."

The beautification of the chapel

and the appointment of a rcli—'

gious leader to serve' as dean of
the chapel are being considered
in order to‘ accomplish this aim,
according to Stevens.

brary facilities of thc college was
includcd in the Len-year plan he~
cause the present library facilities
arc becoming inadequate, the
trustees say.

Collcgc. T , college plans a year—
long celebration of the centennial,
