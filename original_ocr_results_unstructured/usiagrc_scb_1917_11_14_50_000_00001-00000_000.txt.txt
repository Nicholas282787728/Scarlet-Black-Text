Scoring Almost Continual in First
Half, but Knox Braces in
Second

Nine men played their last game of
football on Ward iield last Saturday-
rvhen Crinncll trimirred the fast Knox
team by a ii-7 score. The game was
the last one which will be played on
the local field this year, and gave the
spectators their last chance to see the
team which, wiur practically the same
lineup, has for three years been mak-
ing gridiron history for the scarlet and
'black.

Captain Augustine, Watt, Day. 0s
good. Hoyt. liartin, Wires. Saysell and
Han‘ety were the men to make their
ounl appearance, and, as usual, it was
the we of these men which featured
the Gl'inhell playing. Four years ago
these men formed the nucleus of one
of the host freshman teams Crrnncll
has seen for many moons, and three
year-s of varsity experience has coordi-
nated them into a per-feet working ma—
chine with two Iowa conference chains
pionships to their credit, at third one
in view, and also a good lookdn for
the state title.

Pllly Srrrrppr Football

Tire game Saturday was it far better
one than the onevsldetl score would
indicate. Both teams played snappy
football. but Gl'lllnell took the visitors
do to ir feet in the liver few minutes
of play, men they recovered a tumble
of the initial kickoff and smashed their
way to a touclrdorvn. A long for-ward
pass a few moments later cinched the
victory for the locals, and from then
on scoring was easy in the ﬁrst half.

Knox came back an entirely diffen
ent team in the second round, how-
ever, and held Gi-inneil in six lonely
points in the entire second half. Their
score had been made in the iir t half.

TIT PREVENT A ﬂﬂLl] “KEEP ,
FHYSIBALLY FIT”--SFRAGUE

"At this season of the year the at-
ﬂiction commonly known as ‘a cold'
bccomcs prevalent and continues so
thruout the fall and winter.“

Thus Dr. John F. Spraguc. medical
examiner for men and women, has is
shed some advicc for the prevention of
colds and illness. Upper class students
as well as freshmen are not hing ad-
vantage of the campus rncdicnl "l,
thinks Dr. Spragne, which he atti‘ibr
utes to the neglect of student personal
hygiene.

Colds, according to Dr, Snraguc, are
the result of taking into the system
certain prior rol‘gdlllsms, the nature
of which r Vzu'lilllle that the med—
ical profession has riot determined the
cause of its prevalence during the
winter months. Whether it is true
that wet feet or a draft of cold ztlr on
the hack of the neck will cause a cold
is a question that not all persons agi-ce
upon, “Physicians generally hold to
the belief that the disease is caused
by contact with persons carrying the
germs or by infecting the system in
some way with the virulent germs,"
says Dr. Spraguc. ‘

r Those whoso i . stanc low should
mold sudden or great variations in
temperature, as they become rcadyvi
thus to the malady, pointed out Dr.
Spraguo, and commonly one oi the
ﬁrst symptoms of pneumonia is a cold,
of tuliorculo. s, scarlet fever. measles
and many otlr . afflictions. _

“Keep physically ﬁt," advised Dr.
Spl‘aguc, “and in good Senseizlliy one
who has a cold can give it to you.
Colds shollld be looked upon with suse
picion and at lc‘ast personal quaran-
tine maintained until the exact nature
of the condition is deter-mined."

Yenrling‘s Win, 19-7, by Strong
"Comeback” in Second
Half of Clash

NURTHERNERS HAVE FAST TEAM

Cadets Score Touchdown Near
Opening of Contest, After
Fifty—Yard Run

Altllo they were out-scored and out-
played the i half of the game, the
Cr-inrrell freshman tcarn staged a real
come-hack in the second half of their
game with Shattnck military academy
on \Vard held last Saturday, and carnc
out with the long end of a 13-7 score.

The northeriicrs came down with a
light out fast and shifty tcairr, which
opened rip with a good variety of plays
early in the game and scored their-
only tally. Wei-hing the hall to the
middle ol the ﬁeld, Altlilirseh, the
midget qllmtel'. shot the hall to Webb
on a beautitui forum-d p , and the
latter made a fifty 'ui‘rl run to a toucllc
down, kicking his goal. For the rest
of the half they held their opponents
scoreless, allho they were salad at 097
poi-tune times when sorrre ireshman
irrau fumbled the ball.

l’r ls Como llllcll Strong;

The preps could not he denied in the
second lrnlf, nerve er. in the third
quarter Vinsel was sent over for a
tally, and Crane harcly mi ed the goal
lronr a‘ difficult angle, his kick falling
in t a few inches short. The fourth
quarter was the one in wh .h the yehlu
lings iron the game. Early in that
period they went over with the ball,‘
only to be called hack lrccousc of an
offside penalty.

Shortly after they worked the ball
down within scoring distance. and
Crane smashed his way across. Yarn
kicked the goal. Later on in the same
quarter snattuck was forced hack to
their own goal line, from which place
a.prrrit wits attempted. Olson hroke
thru, however. hlocked the kick and
recovered the hall on Shattllclf’s two-
foot line. French made a touchdown
on the next play, but Yarn missed the
soul.

The work of the ire in .n hackneld
was snappy. but was marred sonic-
what by fumbles in the ﬁrst. half.
They played foothall in the second
round. and deserved the Vicinl'y, Haas
starred with his lung and runs, while
Crane showed up especially well at
line smashing and in the passing
game.

The line played an excellent game,
on dcfcnsrre e. ccially. Olson and
