Women’s basketball has one last chance to win

Basketball hits the road looking to end the season on a positive note after winning the last home game of the year

BY KEVIN BVRNE

It took five extra minutes of basketball to decide
the outcome ofthe Grinnell College-Illinois college
contest last Saturday in Galcsburg.

The women's team found itself deadlocked us regs
ulation expired, but the Pioneers were outscored by
six in the extra period foi a final score of79-73.

Hannah Wolf’OS was back on the court in top
form after 5 ing on the bench for the hst ﬁve games
with a leg injury.

Wolfwas the game’s high scorer, putting up a total
of23 points, including six out of12 shots from three
point territory

Emily Kolbe ’07 had 11
points and three rebounds,
Katie Schumachcr ’07 also
had 11 points and Katy BoWs
en .06 dished out a game—
high nine assists.

“It was great to come back
again,” said Wolf. “I’m really
glad to be able to play in the
lastfew games. Sitting our for
five games was really hard for
me, especially since it was the first time in my life to
ever miss a game."

The Pioneers went into halftime trailing by five,
but came out ﬁring in the second half, putting up 40
points and pulling even with IC before the end of
regulation time.

Unfortunately, the women struggled slightly in
overtime, giving up 12 points while only netting six.

Although the Pioneers could not bring home a
win, it ms still a very good game overall for the woms
en. All of the team put in a solid performance and a
tremendous amount of effort.

Pour Pioneers played for at least 30 minutes dur
ing the game and as a team, Grinnell shot 45 percent
from the field.

Illinois College also had a good game, going 217
25 from the free throw line, highlighted by Courtney

Allen’s perfect 11-for-11 fiom the line.

“Saturday's loss was painful for our team because
we truly left our effort on the floor,"said Head Coach
Andy Hamilton. “Our overall play was solid through-
out the whole game and our sccond-hnlfperformancc
was tremendous. It would be hurtful for us to pin the
loss on any one play or players because at least 10 difs
ferent playsia rebound here, a better shot there, a
defenswc stop—could have changed the outcome."

This past Wednesday the Pioneers had their fi—
nal home game of the season. The Pioneers went up
against conference rival Knox College for the second
time this season and came out victorious once again,
defeating the Prairie Fire 53-
59.

The victory was very ini»
portanr because it allows the
Pioneers to enter their final
game of the season with a poSs
rtive attitude.

The two seniors on the
team, Bowen and Lauren More
edith finished their last home
game at Grinnell with a pair of
strong performances.

Bowen was the game's highsscorer for the Pilot
neers with a total of 15 points. Meredith put up nine
poinrs against Knox and also contributed three re-
bounds und a steal.

The win makes Grinnell’s record 9713 overall (5*
10 MWC).

With just one game remaining on the schedule
and out of playoff contention, the Pioneers are look
ing for another Victory to send the seniors out With a
bang and to build a foundation for the next season.
Grinnell will travel to Lake Forest on Saturday for the
final contest of the season.

“Lake Forest is a strong team, but we hope to get
a good win against a good team on the road," said
Hamilton. “Two areas of the game need to fuel our
success this week — defense and rebounding."
