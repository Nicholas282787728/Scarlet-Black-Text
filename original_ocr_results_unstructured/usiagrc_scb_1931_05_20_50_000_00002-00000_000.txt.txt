AN INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION

The recent move at Yale in abandoning the
classics requirement for the AB. degree has been
the subject of editorial comment all over the couue
try. The Scarlet. and Black last week reprinted an
editorial front the Harvard Crimson which colli-
mended the change with, “Such a change need not
imply a denial by the university of the value or
studying the class‘ s. It would blot out the stigma
of ofﬁcial favoritism which, by arousing an in-
stinctive antagonism, has probably hindered rather
than promoted a true appreciation of ancient litera-
ture and culture.” -

Whether these are solely cultural or not re
mains ﬂ question, however. Pl sent day collegians
cannot bring themselvcs to look upon any study as
a mere cultural asset which constitutes its own rc-
ward. America today demands studies which may
be classed as money makers.

Educators in many departments have clldeav»
ort-d to list the clas ’cs as practical courses by
showing that ill studying them one easily gains fl
comprehensive understanding of his own language.
This, too. has proved unsuccessful ill persuading
students voluntnri ' to enroll for such courses,
Now even the university officials scent to have tak-

en the opinion that perhaps the “dead” languages
aren’t so necessary JtEiOl‘ all. Wlauy Yule students
doubtless believe that. u scrl . has goon done them
in thu -li.uidouiueul of the requirement.

.»\ few men throughout the nation have pointed
out, llolvrver. that this some lilcmis or judging
i‘mil's‘s‘. by the practical value, may eventually
bring brick Carol and Latin in college curricula.
ll lully br idea it to believe it, but the world
verging on all international (‘I'tl from L‘Vidcuccs pro-
v ed by forms now in I)l‘0gl“‘S. Clos ' relation

TO MEET COMPETITION

Almost in proportion, us opportunities for
women in busillt increase. so does competition.
it seems. It is supcllor equiplllcnt, the most rom-
plctc preparation, which must inc 'liilily decide
which of two applicants of approximately (‘qlltil
ability will be, given 11 position.

In business, law, diploma . and ill subordinate
positions ill other profession it is the ﬁrst foot-
hold which is hardest to get. Advancement may rest
on will” brand of work one does. but the first job
depends largely on what one can do.

Grinllcll’s vocational guidance director. Mitch~
ell Dl'ccsc, and the representative of o Chicago only
ploymcllt agency both recommend stcllographic
training to the college woman who would go into
busil ss, The advantages are obvious.

A stcuographiu position is often the starting
point toward solucthiug greater. It can be a foulldae
tiou on which to work.

In the unpleasant but sometimes‘ inevitable
lock ofworl: ill ono’s chosen ﬁeld, stenography of-
fers a temporary alternative.

After success has come. an executive position
is quite often the result, and no one can direct
subordinates as well as someone who can do their
work. It might be that knowledge of stcnography
would help make an efﬁcient executive.

A good course in shorthand mid typewriting
is offered ill Grillucll new. It is an opportunity
which should not be neglected by those students.
especially women, who are considering business as
a career.

the track is fast. Think of this settingin cool evening,
the stands overﬂowing, the whole spectacle brilliantly lighted
with or. Headlights, and a fast trachea record simply
couldn’t stand the “gaff."

Nighttime, when people nnrurnll turn to diversion, is the
logical time for a track meet. Luci; of support will be a thing
of the past. And just watch the athletic fund grow.
