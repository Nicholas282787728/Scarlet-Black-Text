Council Proposes

Seeks To Uni‘l'e lDough-Dunking'
With Faculty and Discussion

By William Buckley

Plans for making eight
o’clock classes informal break-
fast meetings at least once
a semester were served up
before the Student Council last
night along with a dinner of oven
steaks, string beans. mashed po-
tatoes, salad, and banana cream
pie.

There were favorable
comments about the din-
ner.

Part of a larger plan for
student-faculty cooperation,
the breakfast meeting would
replace regular class work
for the hour by dunking the
general field of the course
with doughnuts and informal
discussion.

Served directly in the class
room the class hreak‘fasts would
replace the dormitory and quad-
rangle oatmeal.

“However, this is not a
rat-race,” asserted Kent
Hampton, Student Council
president, who expressed
great favor for the plan.
Emphasizing that the plan must

first have faculty approval, Hamp—
ton said that no elaborate menus
would be planned. “The meals
would probably be coffee and
doughnuts.” he said.

The motion was brought before
the council by Kenet Pearce, presi-

Registration Deadline
Of Thanksgiving Guests

Guests for Thanksgiving dinner in
the quadrangle should be register-
ed with Miss Anne Smith no lat-
er than noon. Nov. 22, the house-
keeping dcpartmcnt announced to-
day. There will be room for ap—
proximately 50 guests,

A true Thanksgiving dinner
with all the trimmings will be
served at 2 p. m. followed by a
program in Main hall drawing
room, according to Miss Evelyn
Gardner, dean of women.

Classes will be dismissed at
noon, Wednesday, Nov. 25, and
will convene again Friday morn—
ing Nov. 28.

A 35.00 fine will be levied on
any student cutting the last class
meeting of any course before the
holidays, and the first class meet-
ing of any course afterward, Miss
McCandlcss said.

Women members of the
Student Council should
wear slacks so the male
elementscan keep their
minds on their work.

This was another mo-
tion by Pearce at the
Student Council meeting
last night.

The motion was
amended by Edward Gil-
bert, delegate from Raw-
son, to require women
members to wear shorts
in order that the male
element would be insur-
ed against keeping their
minds on their work.

After heated argu-
néent, both motions fail-
e .

dent of the Council of House Pres-
idents, who claimed that other
schools have had success with
such gatherings

“We need greater student—fac-
ulty friendship, and our breakfast
class meetings might start some-
thing for Grinnell,” he said.

Other combinations of social and
academic functions for students
and faculty could be attempted,
Pearce maintained. Teas, enter—
tainments, and dinners were dis—
cussd but failed to achieve the
popularity of breakfastdn-class.

Prayer should be used as a means
of personal guidance in these cur-
rent. times of great strain, declar-
ed Dr. Bernard Iddings Bell in
his closing address of the 1941
Gates Lecture series Thursday
morning in Herrick Chapel.

The address; “Of Grace," was
one of five which Dr, Bell has den
livercd during the past three days
to the faculty and student body
or Grinnell and to the Fellowship
Conference of Ministers and Lay-
mcn of the Congregational Chris-
tian Church.

Prayer is a two-way affair; one
must not monopolize the converse-
tion when he speaks with God,
Dr. Bell said. Prayer must be
balanced. it does not consist mere-
ly of asking favors of God.

Dr. Bell set down a model farm
to follow in praying.

First, demonstrate your adora-

Leave Harvest

Hits 32 Ton

Over 64,000 lbs. of leaves will
have been harvested from the
Grinnell campus by today, ac-
cording to Raymond Ferguson.
supervisor of buildings and
grounds.

With each tree unloading a 50
lb. supply of leaves, and with ap-
proximately 431 trees on the cam-
pus, acccrding to actual count,
simple arithmetic shows that over
32 tons of foliage have been re-
moved this fall.

In addition, the leaves have
been wet, Ferguson said, And wet
leaves weigh more than dry ones

With six men toiling for the
past eight da‘ys,eighthcursaday,
to harvest this crop, the job has
absorbed approximately 30 horse—
power per man each day.

The entire task has taken 1,440
horsepower - enough energy to
pull an M. 8: St. L. freight train
from Marshalltown to Grinneli.

Adoration of God.‘

tiun for God.
second, confess your sins, bon—
estly seeking forgiveness.

Third, thank God for everything
he has given you.

Fourth, intercede for others,_im—
ploring God’s grace upon them,
especially the unfortunate.

Fifth. Finally, you may peti-
tion God on your own behalf. One
has no right to pray for luxuries
or superfluities. however. merely
for the necessities of life.

This is not the first period of
strain which believers in Christ
have gone through, Dr. Bell add—
ed. Men's hearts have been put
asunder many times in the history
of Christian faith.

"Grace of God Necessary"

“Human beings can never re
main holiest. in a world of dis-
honesty, nor can they remain purc
in a world made impure under
their own strength. The grace of
God is necessary for them to live
a Christian life."

This was the outstanding
thought of the fourth Gates lec-
ture, “or Morals," given Wednes-
day night by Dr. Bell.

Christ left no definite rules on

the earth for people to follow, Dr.
Bell said.

If this had been true, the rules
would have been common to the
customs of the first centuiy and
could not be applied today.

instead, Dr. Bell stated, Christ
put one principle before the
world: “He who wills to save his
own life shall lose it, and he who
is willing to lose his life shall
at the same time find it."

"Church is Stabilizer"

"The influence of the church
has been the stablizing factor in
society throughout the genera-
tions." Dr. Bell said in use third
lecture of the series. The address
was entitled, “Of tho Church."

He supplemented this by say-
ing that the church's objective in
functioning is to preserve the
moral character of society. “This
continual moral struggle is the
only thing that has saved society
from disintegration.u

This point is proved by world
history. Dr. Bell cited examples of
constant rebuilding of the world
order by the church during the
Middlc Ages.
