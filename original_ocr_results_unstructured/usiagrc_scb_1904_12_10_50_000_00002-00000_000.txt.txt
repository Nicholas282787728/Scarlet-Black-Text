Grinncll, iowa, Saturday, Dec, re, I904

@hituriul

N the last number or the Screen

AND BLACK was published the
mayor portion or an article from the
December Nears 'Late, in which it was
suggested that a new policy be adopted
with respect to Grinnell football
schedules in thc tuture. It was re-
commended that managers in making
out schedules should arrange mote
home games, more games with colleges
or the size or curs and'none at all here-
after without the state. Such ii course,
it is stated, will be possible henceiorth
because at the healthy condition of
the Athletic Union unancially ivhioh
has been brought ahout by the prciits
of 1004. '

There is every pi'Jmis‘c that the
schedule [or 190:. will he made up in
accordance with the aboresuggestions.
N0 proposition with respect to ath-
letics could have met more general
approval than has the one Just made
public and the wisdom or the plan is
too obvious to need rehearsing.
Nothing will begmorc ciiective in pro-
ducing and maintaining college loyalty
than more home games and more in
which we haveachance to win. All
honor to the management which has
reduced the debt anti all honor to the
football team that was called upon to
sacriﬁce the greater pleasures or the
sportonthe alter or business polio
It the intnre of Grinnell athletics is
to be all it promises to be the coming
years will have much ior which to
thank the seasoliof1901.

MERICA’S pride is individual
liberty. In every line or action

right and justice stand out, nominally
at lelsri, as the wrtchwords of our
treedom. But with all the selfrsauis-
motion that we take in viewing the
monument we have raised, we oiten
blind ourselves to. the delects in
masonry. liveninouroivndemocratic
college we share wrth other com-
munities the anxiety over individual
rights circumvented, and justice
crowded out of our consideration.
Each one of .us is an oilehtlet to a
greater or less degree. Hub of late,
