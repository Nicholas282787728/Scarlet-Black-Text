procession of the late Major General
Leonard Wood, and many other offi-
-cial demonstrations. They provided

Devin of Women Tells Unity Circle
Why Lnrmen Should study Art.

 

 

 

“of all the arts, architecture is the
one the layman should study first,"
said M s Luella J. Read of Grlnucll
ccilege Wednesday in her addrs on
“A Laynmn's Enjoyment of Architecr
ture" to the members of Unity Circle.
"It is the most accessable and the
easiest to understant,‘

Although paintings and statuary
are rarely found in the American
home, anyone can make use of archir
lecture to bring beauty into everyday
surroundings. according to Miss
Read, The same principles of design
which govern the other two branches
of the ar . painting and sculpture,
also govern architecture,

The speaker gave a brief outline
of the history of architecture, ex-
plaining how tile 1; .man can trace
the ambitions and customs of the var-
ious peoples in their buildings.

“The Egyptians wanted perma-
nency morc than anything else in
life, so they built pyramids and Lem»
pics which they hoped would last for—
eye , she said. “in the same way the
Greeks valued perfection, the 1207
mans power. The new modern sky-
scraper architecture in America is in»
tlicative of the character and spirit
of the people. Its development is
something of which we can be
prom."

A real mostcrpiece in art speaks
for itself, according to Miss Read,
and needs no critic or connoisseur
to explain its appeal to the people.
“Anyone whose mind ftnd heart are
open find not bound by tradition can
recognize a real work of art," shc
declared.

Weishndr and Best Direct Plays
Given Friday Before Members
Of Beginning Glasses.

 

 

The first two plays produced by
members of the Experimental thea»:
tre staff were presented Friday after-
noon in the Auditorium of A. R. H.
to the elementary Play Production
class, These were entirely student
productions. Several of those who
had charge of the plays have bad no
previous experience in this llne of
work.

"For Distinguished Service" direct-
ed by Margaret Wcisbaar and having
in the cast Alice Child, Miriam
Spaulding, and Martha Miller, is an
entertaining comcdy drama by Flor»
ence Clay Knox. It was well dir-
ected and the acting was intelligent
and introspective for the most part.
The lighting effect was not all that
could he desired but in no Way de-
tracted from the interest of the play.
The stage settings and costumes were
well in keeping with the theme of
the play which held the interest of
the alldlenCE’lhl‘Ougholli.

“Two Crooks and a Lady” with
Myrle Best directing was staged also.
The cast for the play included Vivian
Fansller, Margaret Wood. Hazel
Smith. William Schmaedecke, Claire
Vt att, and Elton Ellis. The play is a
melodrama with more action than
"For Distinguished Service." The dire
ection was creditable and tllc acting
good in most instances.

Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, instruc-
tor in Dramatic Production, announ-
ced that the class would be expected
to hdnd in criticism of the plays and
be able to discuss the different phases
of the productions. There will be
two more given next week.

In Support of Socialist;
Ken- Speaks Also,

 

 

 

The Norman Thomas club met in
Building Four's cluhroom at 7:15
on Friday evenlng, with over thirty
persons in attendance. Prof. it. B.
McClennon and Prof. Earl D. Strong
cnumeruted some of the arguments
in favor of Norman Thomas, and Miss
Louisa Sargent gave her personal
impression of Mr. Thomas as she
heard him speak ten years ago, Mrs.
R. Y. Kerr discussed George Bern-
ard Shaw's book. “The intelligent
VVumtin’s Guide to Socialism." Free

lessor Milton Wittlcr presided at
the meeting.

Mrs. Keri' named as the great
lriurnvirate of sooialistic writers
Karl Marx, Henrick Ibsen, and

George Bernard Shaw. “Shaw’s latest
Work,” she said, “is the most interest
ing five hundred page book I know
anything about, Willi the possible exr
ception of a few novels.”

“There are certain concrete issues
in American life in relation to which
only the Socialist part has a stand
that is reasonable and far reaching,"
stated Professor McClennon. He 01):
posed Mr. Hoover because of his stand
on the farm question. on the unem-
ployment situation, and on the power
problem. "At least refrain from vot-
ing for Mr. Hoover," he said. “If
you vote for Mr. Smith, that is not
quite so bad; but it will be still bets
ter if you go all the way and cast
your vote for Mr. Thomas."

Strong Speaks

Professor strong reviewed his D017
iticnl feelings during the course of
the present presidential campaign
When Hoover was nomi ated, he
thought he would vote for Hoover be
cause he admired his ability and ac-
complishmonts as an engineer. As
the campaign progressed, he decided
to vote for Smith, and as the can
paign degenerated into a battle of
meaningless words. he turned to Nol’r
man Thomas “If the campaign last-
ed much longer," he Said, "I would
probably have voted tor Mr. Foster of
the Communist party

Mr. Strong enumerated his argu-
ments against tile major parties and
their candidates. He saw no hope in
either. “The Socialist party has gii»
on up its doctl-inaire attitude," he
said. “It has become practical, and
it offers promise of doing pro-
gressive things. Its candidate is
equal in ability. perhaps superior, to
either of the other two Candidates."

Miss Louisa Sargent recounted hel-
impression of Mr. Thomas as she res
lnenlbcrs him as a speaker at a con-
ference of Recirculation at Highland
oil-Hudson ten years ago. Mr,
Thomas was at the time editor of
"The World Tomorrow," and also i
minister. Miss Sargent said she re—
called him as c minister and an edle
tor, “a superb minister and a superb
editor.” “i am going to vote for him,"
she said, "because I think he's ’most
of a person' of any of the candle
dates." '

219 Pounds; Average Weight
of Team 195 Pounds.

 

The Marquette team which comes
to play the Pioneer eleven, on Dad's
day November 3 will prove no ”set
up” according to advance indications.
The "Golden Avalanche" invades
Grinpell with a seasoned squad head.
ed by Captain Walter (Swede) Geh-
ert who Won Alermerican honors at
halfback last season.

Eight of the players in the prob
able starting lineup are lettermen.
and a fair number of reserves have
won their “M's" at the Catholic
school, Among those who played
prominent parts on last year‘s team
are Gilbert Corbett, quarterback,
Robert Crowley, halfhac and
George Gibollt 193 pound guard.

The Marquette squad will have
none an edge on the Grinnell team
in weight, In the line will be John
Gritzmanhcr, a sophomore tackle
from .ilukwonago, Wisconsin who tips
the scales at 219 pounds. Plltylng
next to him will be Cliff lfambino
191 pound guard, while the other'side
of the line will be bolstered up by
Glbout's 193 pounds.

sophomore recruits raise the aver-

thur (Red) Bultman who played his
"prep" football at Green Bay, Wis,
may be sent in at center where his
191 pounds can be used to good ad—
vantage, while Francis Dieg, Mt,
Vernon, Ind, 185 pound fullback is
likely to be sent in for part of the
time. There are also a number of
heavy upperclass reserves, who have
not as yet won letters, among them

and Mark Gehl. 202 pound tackle.

Fresh Hold Varsity
To 12 to 6 Win

The power behind the throne
the potential power of the Grinuell
varsity football Squndicttlne into
their own Friday afternoon when the
freshman football squad, forced the
varsity to the limit to win the game
played on Ward field, 12 to 6. After
being carried off their feet in the first
half by the varied attack of the Rio-
neers, the yearlings, led by Thomas
and Arrassmith, came back to force
the playing in varsity territory most
of the last periods and to threaten
twice in the last quarter, being three
yards from the goal and two downs to
so when the game ended.

Playing with the same team that
defeated Arnes 3 to 0, the same squad
that very nearly wrecked havoc with
the Drake morale, except for the ab-
sence of Captain Fail, the varsity
failed to romp over the youngsters
with their customary abandon.

It took a few plays to wake the
preps up, however. Early in the
game MCIntire got away for 40 yards
and it only took a few drives then
to put the oval over the line. The
kick tell short. christoffersen, bur-
ly freshman lineman fiom Cedar
Itapids evened things up a few min-
utes later. however, when he picked
up a varsity fumble on a dead gals
lop and rambled for a in yard jaunt
of his own and a touchdown.

In the second quarter the Pioneers
opened that varied passing and run—
ning attack which puzzled the veter-
ans of Drake, and marched down the
field to a sccond touchdown, a pass
for 30 yards turning the trick. Ruff
was rushed in for the kick but failed.

The second half was mainly a kick—
ing duel with Thomas of the youth—
