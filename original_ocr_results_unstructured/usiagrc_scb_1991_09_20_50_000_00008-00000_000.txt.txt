Morrison's hedonism
depicted in The Doors

By Jennifer Stukas

It‘s not necessary to be an avid
listener of 60‘s music to appreciate
Oliver Stone’s depiction of that thor-
oughly self-important band, the
Doors, in his movie, released last
March, of the same name. Nor is it
necessary to care for that king of
pretention (though terribly sexy) Jim
Morrison, played wonderfully here
by Val Kilmer. Even hating all the
characters, The Doors will still fasci»
nate you.

By focusing on the rock band that
most courageously challenged
society's ideals, Oliver Stone has il-
lustrated all that was good and bad
about the younger generation in the
60’s. The energy, the questioning of
authority, the search to expand the
mind are all depicted, but equally
present are the overuse of drugs, the
mass chaos, the hedonism. Jim
Morrison himself, viewed as an icon

by his generation, is portrayed as a
reckless, selfrcentered, and danger-
ous maniacialways seemingly will-
ing to die,andlotake others withhim,

In the role of Jim Morrison is Val
Kilmer,andthecastingcouldn’thave
been better. Not only does Kilmer
have the looks, he also has the cocky
mannerisms, and, most amazingly,
the voice, as several mellow a
cappella numbers clearly illustrate.
Other actors include Meg Ryan as
Jim’s abused but loyal girlfriend
Pamela, Kathleen Quinlan as Jim’s
secondary lover, and Frank Whalley
as Robby Kriegcrgguilarist and au-
thoroftheDoors’ hit“LightMy Fire."

See The Doors for the music, the
acting. the plot, or the cinematogra—
phy (especially amazing in the pewa
scene), but don‘t see it messed up
This movie is a trip in itself. The
Door: will be shown on Friday at
7:30 and Sunday at 3:00 in the Harris
Cinema.

Classic Freaks may shock

By Brett Fechheimer

When itwas ﬁrstreleasedin 1932.
ads for the ﬁlm F reak: contained the
disclaimer: “Children will notbeper-
mitted to see this picture! Adults not
in normal health are urged not to!"

By today‘s standards, those dis-
claimers certainly seem a bit exagr
gerated. Yet Freak: was,
unsurprisingly, considered rather
shocking in Depression-era America.

The plot of Freaks revolves
around members of a circus side-
show A midget from the sideshow
falls in love with a female trapeze
artist Thelwo marry but thetrapeze
artist after insulting the sideshow
“freaks" and attempting to kill her
husband, finds hersel f the victim of
aparticularly macabre rcvengeplot.

Freakr will be Shown on Friday
and Saturday evenings at 8:30 in
Nonh Lounge.

Volatile race relations presented

in 1967's In the Heat of the Night-

By Brett Fechheimer

lnatown intthississippiboon-
docks, the owner of a soonrlo-be-
built factory is murdered. His widow
(Lee Grant) tells the town's bigoted,
somewhat bumbling police chief
(Rod Steiger) that if her husband’s
murderisn’tsolved,thefaclory won‘t
be completed. At the same time, a
black “homicide expert” from Phila-
delphia (Sidney Poitier) is passing
through the town, and he stays to
assist the police chief with Ihe case.

Thus begins the inevitable con;
ﬂict between the Steiger and Poitier

characters—thedrivingconﬂictoflh
the Heal afzheNighl, the 1967 Acad-
emy Award winner for BestPicture.
With Heat, director Norman
Jewison Crcaled an engaging film
which helped to destroy the prevalant
film stereotypes of African-Ameri-
cans, Heal provides the viewer not
only with a forceful deteCtive story,
but also with a fascinating look at the
way in which American race rela-
tions were being ponrayed and per-
ceived on film during a turbulent
era— an era in which assumptions
aboutrace and authority were rapidly
being challenged and overthrown.

Unsurprisingly, then, Hear has A
the police chief gradually modifying ‘
his original hostility toward Poitier‘s
character. As the two work together .
the police chief gains a grudging re
spect for this black professional from
the North. For his part, Poitier‘s
character is unwilling to undermine
his own strong will and conﬁdence in
order to conform to the town’s ex-
pectations.

As one of the most highly-ac
claimed American films of the
1960’s, In the Heat of the Night is
wellworthwatching. Itwillbeshown .
on Sunday at 8:30 in North Lounge.
