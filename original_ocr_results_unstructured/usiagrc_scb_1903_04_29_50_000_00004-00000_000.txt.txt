HOME MEET AFTERMATH.

At the home meet Saturday
1903 duplicated the records of
1895 and 1899 by winning her
fourth home meet. Thus three
classes have won the last twelve
home meets. The Antes home
meet was held Friday and a conlr
parison of records will show some»
thing of the comparative strength
of the teams.

in threerecorrls, only Grlnllell
has done better than Ames while
two are the same. Ames should
win all three weights and the pole
vault without much effort. while
according to prcvious work of the
men the State College representa-
tivcs should win the quarter. tltc
mile, and the high jump. The
dashes, the hurdles, tllc broad
jump and the relays will be oloso
and Grillnell \l’lll n‘ r part of them.

AMES DUAL Mb '1‘.

The tlacl; team will leave for
Antes Saturday morning at 5
o'clock. The men atom good
sltzlpenutl u-rll give a strong ac-
count at themselves, A number
oftmvuspcoplc ato planning to
accompany the and it i.
expected that Gl'inllcll will have
contingent on the

team

a strong

grounds to support her team.
Efforts are being made to secure
alow rate over the Central by
way or Marshalltown and over
the Northwestern from Marshall-
town to Ames. In another col-
umn is a comparison at the
records made in the Ames and
Grinnell home meets. Ames. as
last year, seems to have a strong
all around team with no stars
Her records in almost all the
events are good for so early in
the season, though none of them
are remarkable.

Tile Ames team may be count-
ed on to put up a good ﬁght and
will furnish a sharp contest in
every event and with Grinnell's
proverbiallveaknessln the weights
the chances seem to favor the
Agricultural College team next
Saturday.
