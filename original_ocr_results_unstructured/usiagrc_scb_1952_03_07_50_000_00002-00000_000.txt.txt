; I promised Bob Skrainka and

iJim Maffitt that I'd make them
famous by incntionmg them in
this week’s ”Rub," Now that
l‘m laced with obligation of tul»
filling that promise I'm begin
ning to realize that neither Bob
,noi- Jim has ever done a single
thing worthy of notice in this
space

it it had been Bob Natkin or

iDicir George I might have come
imcnted rm their bald heads, is. a
icept that l wouldn‘t because
they're both very sensitive about
the subject

to go to Mexico and write a
poem about it For a while he
lsoui‘ided like the Cisco Kid but
itlie affectation seemed to pass
with the coming of winter.

So you sec, l‘in raced with an
‘inmossibh task, l'in a press agent
‘foi' a pair of nobodies.

‘ Bill Rex is a nice guy. He told
ime that my column of last week

,‘that l thought that it was lousy.
it'll be darned if Bill didn't grin
and agree with me. In fact he
lreinforced the iudgement with
a few choice phrases.
‘ Vince Yazer. Donn Chatterton.

llime out from their military ob-
lisations to come back and visit
.old Colleeium lowense this week
}and it made me think that, de»
ismte all the reforms being pr
nosed at this time, if guys on
leave bother to spend their pre—
tcious time back at the campus
'it can’t be such an awful place,
llt’s just a thought, and kind
itiioughts about the college seem
to be mighty rare at election
i time,
i Below I go to dinner I’d like
to compliment Harvey Nixon for
approaching more nearly than

iclcver and original campaign,
He’s the only contestant who
hasn’t stepped smiling.
i Good luck, Norm.
