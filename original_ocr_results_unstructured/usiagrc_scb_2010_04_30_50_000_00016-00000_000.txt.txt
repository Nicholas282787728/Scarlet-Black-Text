I'm‘not too happy to hear that no one is writ- -

mg rings, especially from my purelyﬁsenl perspec-
tive. SPARC (Student Publications and Radio
Committee) funds over 5480 in Random Rants
per semester through its allocation to the 5&3.
By my calculations, this means every student pays
at least $0.32 per semester to provide this forum
for brief yet salient self-expression. Ali and the
others already have an editorial page, make them
use that! Get your arguments off of [plans], make
them more visible, and get some use out of your

waste—use it or lose it, kids. f you don’t help this
paper out, I’m sure the Bots would love to pro-

Q: Why such bad crowd control?

1 would like to know who is accountable for
the complete absence of crowd control atTitular
Head. Apparently the best idea that [titular] and
security could come up with was to force everyone
into a giant, conﬁlsed, belligerent mob, and then
scream futileiy at them to stop pushing. Not only
could someone have been seriously hurt (many
people were pushed over, and others lert Harris
entirely for fear of their safety), but mnny people
with tickets were unable to even reach the door,
and the inefficiency of it all wasted everyone’s
time. Why not USE the crowd control ropes to
ensure people actually form lines, and scnd peo-
ple with tickets in through the north entrance? I
hope that by next year the organizers will have
discovered common sense.

A: A Tit Head crowd of shitheads.

id like to recognize the mnrginnlized role played
by the ACE security members working the door at
Tit Head last Saturday.

I spent a lot of time waiting in the lobby before
the event, and the rudeness displayed towards those
Working the door was nothing short of appalling.
As a matter of the situation, some students Viﬂwcd
security as the enemy preventing them from getting
in. instead ofrecognizing the difﬁcult task they were
actually performinruying to keep order amongst
the pushing, yelllng and goneml disrespect demon-
strated by the crowd.

The students working security or any other

job on n weekend night are sacriﬁcing their night

so others can enjoy events such as Tit Head. Let’s
show a little courtesy towards them, and remember
that not getting into a ticketed event isn’t the end
of the world.
Best, .

Need fair donor discrimination

FUCK YOU FDA! For not taking my
blood becnuse i like sucking dicks! Fuck you
for denying the many peo 1e that can be helped
by my 0 positive blood. ﬁnals you for making a
nice nurse nearly cry because she had to tell me
I can’t have “sexual contact” with a man since
1977 rnd donate my possibly life—saving blood.
And to the nurse, I’m sorry you’re regrrhted by
an oppressive organization. FUCK YOU FDA!

Make that exclusive shitheads

1 attended Titular Herd only to ﬁnd that 3
of my friends, who were right behind me in line,
were not allowed in. Itwns an outrage! So,Ileft.
To me ind many others, Tit Head is supposed
to be about the whole campus coming together,
enjoying humor that only Grinnelljans can fully
appreciate. I’m not blaming anyone for the seg-
regation of those unlucky enough to be last in
line. But with thenew facilities that Grinnell
hrs built (and is constantly seeking to build),
shouldn’t there be a space that can accommoa
date everyone interested in Tit Head and other
equally popular events,> I’m sure we can all agree
that Tit Head is not supposed to be about exclu-
slon.
