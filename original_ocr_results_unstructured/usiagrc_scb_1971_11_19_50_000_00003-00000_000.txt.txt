Contracts Delay Council Work

Open iiles, the iacuity wiie issue,
contract renewals, and recruiting oi
black and women iacuity have been
the issues occupying the Executive
Council in its recent meetings.

Further emphasizing its commit
ment to the goal oi increasing the
number oi black and women faculty,
the Council ruled that chairmen may
be informed that authorization to fill
a iacuity position may be withdrawn
if the chairman claims that a suit
able applicant cannot be iound.

The Council also ruled that the
Mathematics Department would be
authorized to seek a temporary re
placement tor Mr. i-ierman during
his leave oi absence in 1972—1973.

Exclusions Excluded

In its special meeting Novembera,
the Council clarified its position on
what materials will be included or
excluded from the open iiies being
maintained by divisional chairmen.

Assaults

Recently iive Grinnell women have
been attacked by an unknown person,
who is fast growing iame as the
Campus Marauder. Although there
were no reported attacks last week-
end, three occurred on the previous

Friday evening and two moreearlier
this year, according to Grinnell
Police Chief Bill Peters.

Peters was patrolling the campus
last Friday and Saturday night and
says, “I’ll be around therea little
bit this weekend, too." Peters des-
cribed the attacker as 17-20 years
of age, about 5’ 9” tall of medium

Hypnosis And Biodegradation

by David Nicolai

Although most independentprojects

being undertaken in the science divi-
sion this semester are really of
interest to scientists only, lhosethat
would interest the entire college
community are probably among the
most original and useful of all the
independents, '

Shirley Johnson's psychology indev
pendent deals with the tactics ems
plDyed by black parents to instill in
their children a high degree of racial
pride and black awareness. The
basis oi the project is reading arti-
cles relevant to the subject, particu»
larly those of two black psychia-
trists, Alvin Pouissant and James
Comer, and the interviews Shirley
conducted last summer in her home»
town, Memphis, Tennessee, with ap-
proximately twenty black children
and adolescents and, in separate
interViews, their parents. She made
Sure that the families interviewed
represented many diiierent economr
in levels.

Under the supervision of Professor
John Morris, Shirley is now come
piling statistics and graphs illustra»
ting the attitudes discovered in the
interviews and is working onawrit-
ten interpretation of the extent and
effectiveness with which the methods
advocated by Mr. Pousstant and Mr.
Comer to encourage racial pride

among black children are being used
in the contemporary black family,

Bill Davis is pursuing a study of
“hypnotic suggestitiility as a social
inﬂuence phenomenon” under the
supervision of Professor John
Dohme. Bill is presently completing
the first phase of his independent,
which consists of background res
search into experiments in hypnosis
by leading psychiatrists. He has also
written to Theodore Barber, one of
the few authorities in the field, for
reprints of his experiments and tips
on the experiments Bill will conduct
as the second phase oi his work.
These experiments will test hypnotic
suggestibility of deainess on a der
layed auditory ieedback device Four
control groups of Grinnell students
will be used: one in a hypnotized
state that will be subjected to sug
gestions of deafness, one conscious
group that will also be subjected to
these suggestions, and onehypno-
tized and one conscious group,
neither one of which will have deafr
ness suggested to it.

The difference between the be—
havior of the groups will be Observed
and hopefully the results of the ex-
periment dealing with the hypnotic
suggestibility of color blindness. He
has yet to form a concrete opinion
on the validity or hypnotism, but
describes himself as being“skepti-

cal"; although he feels the phenomr
enon deiinitely exists, he questions
whether it is truly a drastically 31,
tered state of perception. Bill also
thinks that hypnotism is an under-
researched field surrounded by
mythology that deserves more at-
tentiun in the future

Art Thurston is investigating the
possibility of utilization of SAGA
iood wastes in a new recycling pres
cess called rapid enzymaticbiodegr
radation. Aiter reading last springa
short article in Chemical and En-
gineering News about the process,
which was developed by two scien»
tists at the Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station, Art wrote tothe
scientists and asked for more details
and their assistance inimplementing
the program here atGrinnell, which
to Art's knowledge, is the only co -
lege where this process is beingin—
vestigated. Through this corresponr
dence he has been able to do cone
siderable background research into
the nature of the process and the
advantages it presents over other
recycling processes.

Art received the bacterial strain
culture which produces the enzyme
used in the process from Connecti-
cut last week and will begin pilot
tests later this month. Either late
this semester or over Christmas
break these initial smallrscaletests

ulty Staffing oi last April would be
excluded, but that Dean Wall's cover
letter for the report would be in~
cluded, The Council also ruled that
the itemized list of materials to be
excluded from the the would be

excluded.
Next on the agenda was the
“Recommendations submitted by

fullrtime proiessional women with
iaculty rank". (This report, written
by Miss Noble, was reproduced in its
entirety in the November 12 5&5.)
By a 9-0 vote, the Council decided
that the report must be resubmitted
by all oi the ”fullrtime professional
women with faculty rank” along with
any dissenting opinions.

Moving to the issue oi the aca—
demically qualitied iaculty wire, the
Council decided by a 9-1 vote that
president Leggetl should issue a
statement that no person would be

bni I, wearing g asses.

“Whoever the person is, he is
asking for help,” said Marge Daly,
Assistant Dean of Students, ”He
has a problem!" One girl reported
that "he was very strong,” but
that one point she grabbed his hat and
he said “I’ll leave ii you give my
hat back."

“He strikes me as being really
young," she said. “Hedoesn'tknow
what he’s doing."

Peters advised students to ques-
tion any suspicious-looking people
on campus. “If you see somebody,
question them. If you harrass them,
they’ll leave. One girl reported to
me that she questioned a guy on
campus, and he got out of there.”

 

Pursuetl

will be scaled up to a level at which
the process can handle all SAGA
food wastes next semester,

The process is capable of killing
all the living material within the
garbage and breaking it down into a
substance high in nutritive value,
all within a twentyrfourhourperiod,
The advantages of the process, when
compared with such other means of
garbage disposal as landfills, burns
ing, and composting, are many. It is
not only the iastest, out also the
cleanest.

The cost is minimal; thenecessary
equipment could he designed by
Grinnell students and professors,
old EALG drums could he used to
supply the main equipment require
ment of the process: storage space
in which the garbage can be treated.
The only other major needis an open
space where the treated material
could be dried, The process could
easily handle the quantity of SAGA
food wastes, as the Connecticut tests
have treated one-halftonaday, more
than the amount of food wastes at
Grinnell each day.

The dried and treated material can
be put to a number oi uses It can
be used as fertilizer; the college
would produce about two or three
tons a week, which could be sold or
given to local farmers, Pasteuriza-
tion of the material would produce
an animal feed permissible under
Iowa state law. It could also be used
as landfill without the Odor, rodents,
and flies associated with conven-
tional landfills.
