Protest dance/theatre gives students with little or no dance experiment the opportunity to
experiment with movement and words to convey an anti-war message

by Amanda Davis

At about 9 am. on Wednesday, 23 Grinneliinns dressed in black
wallted quietly to the steps orthe Des Moines capitol prepared for the
worst. They had prepared to be yelled at, to be ignored, to be rained
on.

Instead, they were received by a slight dampness in the air and a
quiet audience composed mostly of journalists, almost all of whom
stayed for the duration ofthe 30—minute performance. The show mak-
ing its debut was "Movement: An AntieWat Project."

“Movement," directed and choreographed by Jill Peterson '03 and
Barbi Rodriguez ’02.; is part dance and part protest. It is also the
final project for peterson's independent study course, “Protest Dance/
Theatre," under the advisement etChris Conneily.

Peterson said that the idea to address an aspect of social iusrice
through danee came before the decision to focus on the war.

“At the beginning we played around with a number or different
[issues],” she said, “[bur] the war was deﬁnitely what people were talke
ing about and it seemed like the most logical choice and the issue we
could people rallied behind,"

During the changing status of the war in Iraq, the dance has re-
mained ﬂuid. The group actually started working on the dance before
the us. invaded Iraq, and the performances are happening arter the
occupation of Baghdad.

“It’s constantly been growing and we've added angles that we didn't
intend on doing," Rodriguez said. “Our incentive hasn't change and
the core values haven’t changed either."

As a political dance. the piece deﬁes easy characterization. It in.
cludes spoken words and statistics as well as physical movement. “i
wanted to do something that was very in your race and that would
shoelt people," Peterson said. “i wanted to use rhetoric that was being
thrown around, for example when I heard Bush’s State of the Union
Address I wanted to use that as a script for part of it."

Although Rodriguea and Peterson directed "Movement," thecho»
reography or the piece was partly generated based on the dancers dis.
cussions of war. At the ﬁrst meeting of all the dancers, they held an
hourelong convetsation about the war in harp and what it meant to
those present. From that discussion, Rodrique’L and Peterson chose
phrases which then became the themes of the different scenes of the
dance.

Group consensus and conversation were really important, Peterson
said. “We usually started out rehearsals with a conversation about what
was going on and how people were reeling," she said. “All ortbe deci—
sions about the movements and who did what were made on a con-
sensus basis."

For those with little cxperIEUCc in dance, being able to contribute
to the choreography or the piece was rewarding. "You got to realize
that what you were thinleng could translate into something workable,"
said dancer Elisa Lenssen ‘05. “Every one ofus was so much a part of
the process, working up to the ﬁnal product.”

For dancer Katie Mean ‘03. the discussions were the best part of
the project. “Everybody in the dance is very thoughtful, but coming
from dinerent directions," she said. In addition to providing new pet.
spectives, coming together to Work on the dance was empowering. “It
can be so easy to be panilyeed. one orthe pieces I'm in is about hope:
we’ve had conversations in my group about where you find hope and
oprimism," Mears said,

one orrhe difﬁculties that arose in praetieing dance by consensus
was the hole ofexpcrlence on the part of most ottlie participants. “It
took me a little bit to ﬁgure out how to challenge everyone without
putting anyone in over their head," peterson said.

The less experienced members ultimately added to the piece, said
Rodriguez. "It made the people [in rhe dance] that much more per.
sonally invested, and the piece that much more powerful." she said.

Another difficulty for some was whether dancing was really politi.
cally effective. “I was somewhat siteptieal about the idea of pcrfare
mance as protest," said Denny David '03. But after watching the me-
dia coverage of the dance. David said he has seen that “it raises ques.
tions for the media and people who see it because they don't usume
they understand it. It‘s a way orstarting dialogue."

Despite her own initial doubts about whether the piece would work,
Elisa Lenssen ‘05 was also happy with the result. “It surprisingly felt
lilte the right thing to be doing, something that was going to be worth.
while and meaningful andconveying a message,” she said. “I never felt
like we were iust throwing our arms about."

For Lenssen, performing the piece publicly for the ﬁrst time added
to the sense or purpose, “It's really dinerent to be out there on the
steps in the open and not to be thinking about where you are on stage.
but to be thinking about telling people something," she said.

Concert Preview

Percussion and Marimba Ensemble
Friday, April 18
7:30 p.m, in Sebring-Lewis

Andrew Rinne '06 is a member of the Grinnell
Percussion and Marimba Ensemble. And yet, he said, ”I
don't actually play any drums.” ,

Rhine will be not playing the drums at this Fridays
Percussion Ensemble concert. The ensemble's
instrumentation indeed exceeds the more stereotypical
notion of the Lrap-set~banging percussionist.

Eighteen students and community members, playing
the marimbe, xylopiiune, glockenspiel, vibes, maracas.
wind gLass, snare drum. or other percussive varieties will
be performing this Friday at 7:30 in Sabring-lewis under
the direction of Mark Dari.

The concert will be, according to Rinne, an “eclectic
mi!’ of works the ensemble has been rehearsing since
the semesters beginning, Composers whose pieces are
being performed cover a wide range, from avant—garde
John tape to the Romantic period's ciaiide Debussy to
contemporary Brazilian artist Aim) Morena.

Percussion also provides a wide range of aesthetic
effect. “You can cover a pretty good emotional range
with percussion instruments,” Rinne Said. His favorite
piece to practice and soon perform is Xylophone. "It’s
upbeat, it’s interesting," he said. ‘Tt’s happy~snunding."
Xylophaniu is an arrangement of a piece by vaudevilliau
performer Joe Green.

Members or the Percussion Ensemble are happy to use
concerts to disprove misconceptions about percussive
possibilities. “There's a whole other world of percussion
music that a lot of people don't even know exists,” said
Rinne.

The ensemble meets twice a week and individual
members practite on their own time. A large amount of
time in this Fridays concert, Rinrle noted, will involve
one of the more timeless percussive instruments. "This
concert does feature extensive gongage," he said, ”Even
a water gong."

And what, Exactly, is a water gang? "You have to
Corrie to the concert and ﬁnd out." Rinne answered.

Titular, cont. from pg. 9

Star Wars spoorrhis yat, an idea inspired by Matt Danlt
'03. part orrhe ﬁlm was set in Herrick Chapel and in one
scene theiesus character played by Mike Heller ’03, is in a
ﬁght scene.

Heller wmrs a belt and loinclorh. At one point “he
ended up nalted. . .in Herrick Chapel,” oid I-Ianes.

Hanes explained die premise ofhis ﬁlm, Rtmrrr aft/e
[no-Dias a “religious satire, ifyou want to mlltsiriarr about
it, [but] it's mostly justdiclt and tart jokes."

The amusement of dick and tart ioltes ends artei the
ﬁlming. “It's run to ﬁlm," said Hanes, "but the nightmare
begins with editing.” l-Ianes said that sometimes it is hard
for people to get cameras; a complication which he hopes
to eliminate in the years to come,

“In the future I'd like mmeras to be more readily avail.
able," said Hanes. “There are a lot orgood ideas not being
made because it's intimidating,"

Everyone involved seems very excited about Titular
I-Iead this year "The quality orrhe lilms is better than I’ve
ever seen in my three years on the committee and my four
years here," said Sarah Aswcll '03, head orthei'itularriead
Film Committee.

For this reason the oommitree decided to show all 17
submissions. “All of them have iedeeming aspects. It was
really quite a good year,” said lacltey Bradley IversoneLong
'05 who win taite over as head ortho committee next year.
“We were just amazed watching them,“

Simons is loolting rorward to the festival, posting on
her Man, “I can't remember the last time I was as excited
for an event as I am torrirular Head. Seriously, I reel like
I'm in second grade and I’m going to Disneyland."
