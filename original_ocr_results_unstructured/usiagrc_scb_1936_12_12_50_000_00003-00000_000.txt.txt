Settingu Lights, Music
Aid in Recreating
Atmosphere

By Rob Enrehett
The three plays from the Ches-
ttel' Cycle presenting the nativity
and the adoration, given by the col-
lege plsycrs in Herrick chapel,
were well received by a large and
impressed audience.

The medieval atmosphere was
effectively recreated through a
simple and suggestive set, lighting,
costumes and the impre .lvo arr
gan music of Elbert Smith.

Color Clash

The altar and the startlingly
white shrine made a pertect back-
ground for these sacred dramas,
and the lighting enhanced the var-
ied cold of the klngs‘ costumes.

The plays are, of course, very

achieved by the continuation of the

The three shepherds, played by

Harry Duncan, as Trowle, the

HEN WINTER COMES, with its added hazards

They provide ample power, warmth and comfort. They clear
the way with snow plows, thaw out switches, inspect
signals, keep in touch with hail-ls by telephone "and
telegraph. Theirs is a devoted and resourceiul personnel,
accustomed to winning battles against the elements. 0 While
some regions of the Illinois Central System are more tor-
