Creighton Hopes to Make Game
With Grinnell Its Fourth-Con-

’ Coming completely out of their
early season slump, Creighton univelu

entirely outdistanced their oponents in
the last three games by relatively large
the last tbre games by relatively large
scores.

After suffering a 284) defeat at the
hands of the speedy Haskell Indian
team, Creighton woke up and took the
next struggle from the Michigan Ag—
gies at East Lansing by a 21 to 6
score. The following week they com—
pletely out-classed South Dakota Uni-
versity on the Omaha gridiron by a
34—0 score made by straight football.

Last Saturday they faced Oklahoma
Aggies at stillwater. This time they
won by a 13 to 2 margin, when Okla-
homa was given a safety. A bad pass
from center, Nolan to Mahoney, left
end, was recovered by Mahoncy behind
his own goal—lino.

Suffered Slump

Creighton started the season by de-
feating Midland College of Fremont.
13—0.
to Lawrence, Kansas, and held the Jay
hawks to a to score. in a game which
the K. U, daily student paper frankly
conceded was Creighton's due to su-
perior playing. The next week the
Hilltoppes machine faced the Kansas
Farmers at Manhattan, gaining an»
other victory on paper, but losing by a

single touch—down, 6-0. 5

Then, South Dakota State howled
Creighton over by a 27—20 score, after
traveling behind for three quarters.

The following Week a decided upset
came, when Des Moines heat Creighton
in her ﬁrst home game, 7 to ii, The
team was in a slump.

Wynne then shifted Mahoney to end
from quarter; Luepke from end to
half; and put in diminutive Eddie
Hickiey at quarter against the much-
touted Haskell Indians. A week's
practice with this combination was not
enough and the Indians won. But in
the Michigan Aggie game Creighton
hit a stride that is almost unbeatable.

Hickley has shown up well at aunts
tcr. Lower scored both touchdowns
against the Oklahoma Aggies, making
one 40-yard run, and Luepke has been
playing a stellar game.

But injuries have handicapped the
team. Paul Fitz—Gibbon, the best
White and Blue half of the 1923 squad,
broke his leg in the south Dakom
State game, and now Leupkc, starhalf,
is out for the last game of the season
as a result of injuries sustained in the
Oklahoma Aggie gama.

Emerging from Cyclone Struggle
Without Injuries, Team Is in
Good Condition.

TEAM LEFT EARLY THIS
MORNING FOR CREIGHTON

Same Lineup Is Doped to Stain
. Against Catholics As Was
Used Against Andes,

Twenty—three football men and
Coaches Elward and Hyland left early
this morning for Omaha, where the
Pioneers are scheduled to meet the
Creighton eleven tomorrow in the last
game of the season.

The men came through the game
with Ames without injury and they are
expected to be in top form when they
trot on the field tomorrow afternoon.
The contest with the Cyclones showed
a great improvement in the squad dur—
iug the past two weeks. Sweet was the
mainstay on the offensive, skirting the
ends and passing in wonderful lash»
ion, Duke played great bail in the
line. '

Tcumu-ork improves.

The success of the team was not due
to any individual work, however, for
the teamwork and light of the entire
eleven men was responsible for the
showing of the Pioneers.

The men were given but one light
workout this week for the coaches dig
not wish to run the risk of injuries at
the last minute. Most of the time was
devoted to simiai drill. Last evening
a football conference was held between
the coaches and players similar to the
one held before the Ames game last
week.

The team is expected to line up the
same for the Creighton game as it was
at the start of the contest last Satin»
day. bean and Scharnwcbcr will play
ends; Capt Nichols and Wood,tackles;
Duke and Cathcart, guards; Moycr,
center; Jones, quarterback; Wing and
Smith, halfbacks; and Sweet, fullback,
The men will arrive at Omaha about
two o'clock this afternoon and will
take a light workout on the Creighton
ﬁeld.

Good Grades and Neat
Rooms Go Together
at Quadrangle.

it seems to he a continual contest
now—a-days among the various cote
tages of our college . If it isn't a
contest for the biggest collection of
A's, it i's a. struggle for supremacy in
keeping the study table dusted. And
this just reminds us that the Quad
statistician recently made the inter
esting discovery that the girls making
the best showing in'an educational
way have also carried off honors as
the best housekeepers.

The discovery is suprising as well
as interesting, and upsets all well—
established theories that if Mary was
pointed out as a model scholar and a
prospective Phi Beta, it was to be
expected that only the odds and ends
of her time would be given to coat-
ters of keeping the desk straightened
and the cobwcbs out 01 the corners.

Authorities are considering offering
a prize for the best solution of the
cause of this smte of affairs. Either
the combination student—housekeeper
is blessed with innate ability in both
lines, or the one accomplishment
develops the other. .

Perhaps having the neatnest rooms
possible is an incentive to
study, and invites sleep so that the
occupants are always fresh for their
day’s work. And, terra firma, as
the young Latin student said, as-
complishing much Classically speak~
ing would awaken a desire to work
in attractive surroundings.

Nothiuscouldbe more fatal than
to lift One's eye from the solution of
a dilficult math problem and encount-
er a thick layer of dust or a much
disordcred shelf. Whatever the solu—
tions may be, the collegiate world
takes off its very best bat to these
combinations of brains and domestic
neatncss. _

' Telegrams at All’leS
by Local Boosters

Fresh proof that Grinncli stands
onilily behind its football team was
displayed last Saturday by the flood
of telegrdms that reached the Pioneers
just lieofi‘e the game. Every cottage
in the Quadrangle and every building
in the Dorms sent the men assurances
of its support. Many business (inns
in the city followed suit.

The result was that the ﬁghting
spirit of the iPoneers was keyed to all
even higher pitch than before, al-
though, as one member of the team
remarked, “It got kinda monotonous
to hear 'em read."

New Audit System on Campus Not
Deemed Essential by Local
Merchants.

During the past week a canvass of
the local merchants has been made in
an effort to ascertain the amount of
losses or these merchants from year
to year from the various college or-
gauizations. The primary purpose of
the canvass was to determine whether
or not the plan of the student council
to have organization accounts audited
by the college office is necessary
from the merchant’s standpoint.

in practically all cases it was found
that the general loss from organiza-
tion accounts was lower proportion-
ately than the losses arising from the
accounts of the general public. One
case was found in which the merchant
lost from fifty to one hundred dollars
in one year, but this was an exception
to the general rule.

The three local druggists all report
that their losses from non-payment of
organizations was very slight and that
the only losses are amounts of a few
cents, and that the entire amount in
any one case would not amount to
over five dollars a year.

The merchants favored
an audit plan from the stands
point of making payments more
prompt but did not believe that such
a system would be worth while for the
collection of the few debts that do run
from year to year.

The concensus

Such

of opinion among
the merchants )S that, as a general
rule, the school organizations are
prompt in their payments, and only
can rare instances be found in which
the student organizations forfeit their
bills,

Amos Places First and Grinnell
Fifth {or Second Time in
Efficiency Contest.

THIRTY-FIVE CHAPTERS
AT CONCLAVE COMPETE

Ray Hare is Grinnell Delegate —
Alumnus of Local Chapter is
National Officer.

Orinneli once again vindicated its
claim to leadership among the schools

of the country which actively promote

journalism, by taking ﬁfth place in

the efficiency contest of Sigma Delta

Chi at the national convention held in

Minneapolis November 19, 20 and 21.

First prize went to Ames, a remark—
able showing for journalistic excel—
‘lcncc in the tall corn state. The feat
achieved by Ames and Grinnell ac—
quires added signiﬁcance when it is
noted that this is the second consecu-
tive year that both institutions have
won the same place in this contest.

Raymond Hare, '24, represented
the Crinncll chapter at the conclavc
at which delegates from thirty Col—
leges and universities all over the
United States were present. A new
chapter fromlhe University of To—
ronto took its seat in this convention
for the ﬁrst time, the ﬁrst foreign
school to be admitted to the fraternity,
During the convention proceedings,
Washington State University was ta—
ken into membership and its delegate,
who had come across the country to
present its claims, was immediately
admitted to take a part in the delibera-
tions. -

Ten alumni chapters were also rep-
resented at the convention. At pres-
ent the fraternity is strongest in the
middle west but the west coast is now
represented by five chpaters and it is
expected that the East will be repre—
sented more widely within the next
,few years.

Mix work and Play.

The work of the convention proper
was largely of a business nature, the
committee report system being used
to expedite the vast amount of legis-
ation on hand. This rather drab
side of the proceeding was enlivened
somewhat, however, by the hospitality
of various journalistic organizations
of Minneapolis and the University of
Minnesota.

The Minneapolis Journal and the
Minneapolis Tribune entertained Lhe
delegates on Monday and Tuesday
nights and the delegates had the rare
pleasure of meeting active newspaper
men on their own ground. The lulu—
nesota chapter of Sigma Delta Chi,
thc lllinneajciis alumni chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi, and the Minnesota
chapter of Theta Sigma Phi entertain—
ed the ink dispensers at other times
during their visit.

Donald Clark, an alumnus of the
Grinnell chapter, was elected as ﬁrst
vice—president of the fraternity for
the coming year.
