Fall semester had

(ﬁrst 0/ a series)

The subject ofslress seems to be the lad topic
of the day. It seems that no respectable tulle
show has passed up the doctor interview on just
how to reduce stress in your lifetime. Whether
it is caused by the economic situation orjusl the
eoer-lncretulng pace o/ the modem urban
world, stress seems to affect eueryone of one
time or another.

College students am certainly not immune to
the problems of slrexs,‘ in fact studies show that
stress is most acute during the college years.

In a series of five articles, we will be looking
at academic stress here at Grinnell, some a/izs
caused and some ways to relieve it. We will also
be lookingat today's academic pressures 1n. com-
parison with past years and in comparison to
other colleges.

In this, the first of the genes, we look at the
fall semester of 19.32 and who: made it unique.

The fall semester of 1582 was unique in
different ways for different people. For
freshmen the experience was starting off
in a new environment with new friends.
For upperclassmen the new experience
was adjusting to the reinsmtement of the F
grade. For many students though, the ex
perience was simply coping with what they
felt was a increased intensity of academic
pressure and stress.

There are many signs of academic
pressure or stress. One signal that there
may be a higher level of stress is an in-
crease in the number of reported colds,
{Ins and other minor illnesses.

Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Florence (Flossie) Mitchell, who heads the
Resident Advisor program, said that
usually when the Health Center has an in»
flux of reported illnesses. her staff is also
reporting more problems With students
suffering from stress. According to Mit—
chell, during the fall Semester the Health
Center reported to her office that there
was indeed an unusual number or minor il-
blesses and also of more serious illnesses
such as strep throat after fall break.

More serious was the increased occur»
rences of serious and debilitating illnesses
such as mononucleosis and pneumonia.
Mitchell stated that the number of medical
leaves granted during last semester was
double those granted over the previous fall
semester.

Parallel to the increasing traffic in the
Health Center was the increasing traffic
running through the Student Affairs office
and to the resident advisers. Mitchell
remarked, “We were sensing a buildup of
academic pressure from the traffic
through our office and from speaking to
the RAs.

Mitchell concluded from her Contact
with students in her office and also from

feedback from the RAS that, “Pressure
seemed to be occurring much earlier in the
semester and hanging around much
longer.” She also remarked, ”For
whatever reason. students were notable to
handle nor find a balance with their
studies."

Adding to the overall pressure of the
semester was the increase in pressures
reported by upperclasSmen prior to
deadline for dropping a class without the
class being recorded. Mitchell said her RA
staff and Director of Academic Advising
Ray Obermiller reported to her an in-
crease in stress among the upperclassmen
who were not used to the new F grade
rules. For many the deadline occurred too
soon, before tests and other evaluated
works, to decide whether to drop a course.

students by stating, “People live and
breathe students around here, when there
is a problem they usually know it.”

Lest anyone think that Grinncll is unique
in the signs of pressure and stress, Mit-
chel] remarked that in her meetings with
other ACM schools, they too were repor-
ting an increase in similar Stress related
problems. On a national scale, The Na-
tional 0n-Campus Report stated that cola
lege counseling centers all over the counr
try were reporting increases in the
numbers of students seen for stress and
pressure related problems.

Both Frazier and Mitchell hypothesized
that much of the pressure and Stress is
coming from the outside, that economic
conditions are placing more pressure on
students to do well. Frazier suggested that

Another measure of “end of the
semester stress“ is the number of in-
completes taken. Last fall, 77 incomplete:
were granted. Of those incompletcs, 23
were what Dean of the Faculty Catherine
Frazier called “legitimate” incompletes.
There were 54 incomplete: given for
nonemergency reasons.

The Student Handbook specifies that in»
completes are to be given only in cases
where the student ls unable to complete
the work for reasons beyond ms or her con
trol. Frazier was bothered that so many of
the incompletes were not legitimate and
that. the statistics seemed higher than in
previous year.

Frazier said that the Committee on
Academic Standing (GAS) had been
discussmg the numbers of students having
academic difficulties and asked the Office
of Student Affairs to present the medical
facts to the faculty. Frazier iterated that
the CAS. the faculty and the Student Air
fairs office are continually monitoring

the economic fact of a $9,000 investment
during hard times is bound to place more
pressure on students.

Mitchell also remarked that stress was
not just hitting students hard but also the
faculty and her Skiff. “There‘is no doubt
about it. stress can be infectious!" Mit-
chell stated that last semester was very
hard on everyone. “Abnormal" was how
Mitchell described the semester, ”abnor-
mal” in the sense of the amount of stress
people seemed to be under.

Mitchell, who has been at Grinnell for
two years, said that she did not have the
accumulated experience with which to
rate the semester. But Mitchell did say
that Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederamn, who has been at Grinnell for 15
years, remarked that last fall was definite-
ly one of the hardest he had ever seen.

Mitchell expressed her desire to move on
and forget last semester, hoping for better
semesters ahead.

.13 tables
guidelines

by June Kaufman

Among the issues raised at
Wednesday‘s Joint Board meeting were
Political Activities Fund guidelines.

Langan Representative Eric Fisher,
who opposed the guidelines, argued that
“red tape" needs to be out, He opposed the
clause stating that benefits of PASF fun-
ding must directly affect at least 20 people,
claiming that some activities benefit the
campus community. Fisher also challeng-
ed the sloofunding limit per event, stating
"They [PSAF] have a limited budgef, and
I think it [the amount of money awarded
for events] should be their dictate . . . The
committee members are more
qualified." ,

Peter Haulzinger, Haines represen-
tative, was less optimistic. He countered
Fisher by saying, “Basically, i think that
we should pass it the way it is." He noted
the possiblity of a “committee of five
friends [who] have total control of the
group.”

in answer to Fisher's question, “Do you
really think that. PASF would abuse their
privileges?" Hautzinger replied, “PASF
has a lot of autonomy, and I think we need
to restrict that autonomy,”

The debate ended with the decision to
table the guidelines because of a business
bylaw concerning the amount of time in
advance by which a bill must be available
to JR members.

SGA President John Moffet announced
mat the Board of Trustees opposed the en
forcement of the Federal Selective Service
Law, which requires colleges to deny
financial aid to all students who do not pro-
ve that they have registered for the draft.

A letter to the universities and colleges V
of Iowa concerning the proposal to in
crease the drinking age to 21, currently in
committee in the Iowa legislature, was
tabled indefinitely after Haulzinger in~
formed JB of a meeting he had with Janet
Carl, representative of the Iowa
legislature. According to Haulzinger, Carl
believes that the bill may die in commit»
tee. However, he advised SGA to “keep a
close eye" on the bill in case it should come
out of committee.

A Skip Day questionnaire written by Vic
Rudolph was approved for distribution to
faculty members. An attendance bylaw
was unanimously passed limiting the
number of excused and unexcused
absences for members of JB. Robin Har-
tung, administrative assistant, explained
the SGA election procedures which were
unanimously approved.

The rest of the meeting was devoted to
business.

it was reported in last week's Scarlet
and Black that the Joint Board passed a
resolution that would require at least 20
percent of the hall members to be present
in order for elections to be considered
valid. Joint Board in fact voted the resolur
tlon down.

The Scarlet and Black regrets the error.
