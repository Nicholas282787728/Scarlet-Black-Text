Tragedy in
many forms,
the least of
which is a .
mediocre movie

While In Good Company seems to
offer some solace from genocide and
tragic love you’d be better off just
watching the hard movies because
they’ re much better

Hotel Rwanda (R)

Early in Herc! Rwanda, a reporter says: When Americans
see graphic images of the Rwandan genocide, they 11 say Oh
my God thats horrible, and return to eating their dinners
The movie, based on the true story ofthc African nation's Hutu
extremists’slaughter of therrTritsi neighbors in the 1994 geno-
cide, shows us that the reporter's observation was, and is, all too
accurate

Don Cheadlc stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the Hutu lT‘r‘Al’l’
rigor of Mille Colines, a Belgian-owned luiuiy hotel. Despite
the major unrest in the region and the fact that his wife's family
is of Tutsi descent, Paul strives to stay out of politics and coir
tinue to do his job.

He must buy supplies on the black niailtet and bribes Colo-
nel Oliver (Nick Nolte) of the United Nations and General Bi-
zimungu (Fanrl Moltolcenu) with fine liquor to store up favors
in case he or his family should e\et need them.

However, its the only moderate Hutu' in the neighborhood,
Paul becomes the de facto caretaker for his Tutsi family and
neighbors when Tutsi rebels kill the Rwandan president and
violence increases between the two tribes,

As many of the European and American guests are being
evacuated, it becomes clear there will be no outside aid available
to the Tutsis. Paul turns his hotel into a haven for refugees and
struggles to hind the best way to protect his family and neighe
bots as the Hutu killers come closer.

Ham/Rwanda is particularly relevant in light of the con-
tinuing violence in the Darfur region of the Sudan, and while
it is a dramatization], the film demands that you pay attention.
Don Chcadle’s performance is outstanding—he clearly cit—
presses the alternating fear, panic and courage necessary to take
action in this grave situation. Sophie Okoiiedo is also riveting
as Paul's wife.

The movie was partially filmed in the Rwandan city in
which the actual events took place, lending realism to the cin-
ematography. As a pair otAmei-ican filmmakers staying in the
hotel explain to Paul, it is easy (or us to ignore the horror ofthc
genocide that occurs in remote corners of the world.

But this movie shows us the faces ot‘ the people affected by
that apathv. It is ultimately a him too powertul to be ignored

In Good Company
(PG-13)

Young punks like us are ruling the world.
Today, sex symbols are “barely legill,"only those
under 30 are ever “successful,” and advertisers
only care about the not 18 to 24-year-old de-
mographic How do the old codgers who for
mcrly ran the world react to this?They want to
punch us. At least Dennis qiaid does.

in In Good Uri/“puny, Quaid plays Dari

Phantom of the Opera
(PG-13)

Someone forgot to tell director Joel
Schumather that Andrew Lloyd VVebber's
music isn‘t enough to carry a film. Though it
has rr sophisticated veneer, in movie form the
music is awiavard and pleads pathetically {or
mass appeal.

What should have been the centerpiece of

this ﬁlm is the gothlc creepiness of the original
novel and the story itselfia tale of a young
and beautiful singer struggling to make it, a
tormented musical genius and the artistic llm’
bition and inexplicable obs on that brings
them together in the shadowy halls below the
theatre, But somewhere in inovie-nialting hell,
all ofthat got buried beneath tedious music,
