WHOSE RIGHT. .
The war's forgotten side

Everyone is talking about the
war in the Persian Gulf. Some
people feel that we are doing the
best thing, if not the right thing.
Others disagree completely, but
most people seem very concerned
about bringing our people home
safely and soon. The Des Moines
Register has been interviewing
farnilymembersalotlately and that
has made me do some serious
tllinking.

Wars are traumatic, and every
one involved in them cannot help
but be affected, especially children.
I have realized that I want this war
to stop more for the children titan
for anyone or anything else. Hav-
ing been born just a few months
after my father‘s draft time was up,
and little more than a year after he
came home from Vietnam, I have
grown up with the honors of war.
When I was little,I Wasproud of his
service in a little person's way. I
remember looking at his medals
and his uniform and being awea
struck. My Daddy is a hero. But
later, when he started getting sick,
and when we found out that my
sister‘s birth defect was due to his
exposure to defoliants in Vietnam,
I wasn‘t so proud anymore Why
did it have to be my Dad and my
sister? What ifl'm sick too? What

these things. I want more for them.
Flowers and ponies and kittens and
trees, not scuds or sorties or WW5
and MIAs. The wounds of our last
war are still too fresh for some
young people; these new ones will
not help to heal us. .

And what about the children 0
the Middle East? I understand that
ﬁghting is more common there, and
that military conﬂicts are not uni
known to them, but the pictures of
terrified little eyes peering through
a plastic bag above a gas mask tell
me that this is different from what
they have known before.

Why do I worry so for the im»
pact of war on children? Because
they are the future of tomorrow,
just as we are. Perhaps it is good
that our youth can see war, so that
they will be more likely to hate it
later. I think that [can honestly say
our generation is more opposed to
war than our parents were. They
grew up fearing an attack from be-
hind the Iron Curtain or the
Commies next door. The Vietnam
conﬂict changed those attitudes by
making young people realize that
hatred and fear of our world neighr
bors is destructive. We have been

COMMON

SENSE

On South Africa and racism

Lastweekthereappcared in these
pages a vttriolic letter from Papa
Owusu condemning my “ignorant"
views on race and South Africa
and, predictably, smearing me as a
“racist.” I would like to use my
column space this Week to respond
to Owusu‘s letter and present fur-
ther substantiation of my unpopu-
lar opinions.

Likemanyothcrs, Owusu seems
to have interpreted my remarks
about the relativeaffluenceof South
African blacks as a defense of
apartheid and all its works. What I
have tried to demonstrate is not that
South African blacks live in a mo
lure of prosperity but that they live
better than they will if Nelson
Mandela and his cohorts in the ANC
fulﬁll their aim of a Marxist trans
formation of the country. To know
this, one need only look at the con-
ditions ofblacks in Marxist Africa,
where the living standard is ﬁve
times lower than in South Africa,
Allowed a degree of economic
freedom, South African blacks are
running prosperous stores and res-
taurants. '

It is hard to see how anyone
concerned about freedom could
smile upon the ANC, an unabash-
edly Marxist and pro-Sovietjunla.
The ANC squarely supported the
Soviet Union's 1968 invasion of
Czechoslovakia and its 1979 inva-
sion of Afghanistan. where Soviet
bombs, disguised as toys, maimed

small children. Long before the
advent of percstroika, Winnie
Mandela praised Moscow as
“torchbearer for all our hopes."
ANC spokesmen have extolled re-
pressive governments the world
over—Cuba, Vietnam, Ethiopia,
others—andifllletelseveranANC
regimcinSouth Africa,itwillemu-
late them.

Over the yeais the ANC has di-
recteditsbombing attacksnotatthe
Afrikaaner government, but at pub-
lic beaches, synagogues, shopping
centers. schools, and children. Black
and white, man and woman, adult
and child—all are fair game to the
ANC. How can the ANC be con-
cerned with the rights of blacks
when so many of the victims of its
despicable acLs have been black?

Owusu referred repeatedly to
the “venom" ofcolonial ism. Well,
acenainprominentAfricanrecently
said that African blacks actually
lived better under colonialism than
they do now under Marxism. Pielr
Botha? F.W. dc chrk'.7 No#
Desmond Tutu himself! Owusu is
not, I hope, going to tell me that
Tutu is a dupe ofthe South African
government.

As forOwusu‘s insinuation that

I am indulgent ofwhitc racism In
America, I would like to ask: From
where is the really dangerous ruc.
ism coming? From a few isolated
and much-derided quacks like
Davrd Duke? Or from the bitterly
anti-Scmiticblacks whoenjoy open
and avid supportall over thccoun-
try? Consider Louis Farrakhan, lhc
pro-Hitler lunatic whose speeches
on college campuses are the mod-
em equivalent of Nuremberg ralr
lies. AdiscipleofFanakhan‘sactur
ally spoke at Grinnell lastTuesday,
expounding the theory that white
people are “devils” who originated
inabungledlaboratoryexperiment.
Or consider Stokely Carmichael,
who,inaspcechaiPrinceton,staied
that “We must take a lesson from
Hitler.“ Carmichael got a standing
ovation. In a letlcr in last week's
Scarlet and Black, Can'ie Bulgcr
touted Carmichael as someone who
“fought for freedom arid rights for
African Americans.“ Whata guy!

Owusu remarked that my pen
has spared the Ku Klux Klan. I
would like to remind him that in
thiscounLry,while-on-blackcrime,
although the media confer much
attention on it, is quite rare; black-
on-whitecrimeis motecommonby

Tuesday afternoon, like many
other people, Iwetlt tohcar a speech
by Minister Zaahir Mohammad of

‘ the nation of Islam. [did not go out
ofsimpleacademiccur‘iosity. More
Lhan curious, I was scared about
whatwas goingtobcsaid aboutme.
I expected anti-Semitic slurs and I
could not let them go unchallenged.
I had heard the speeches of Minis-

, ier Mohammed‘s mentor, the Min-
ister Louis Farrakan. I had heard
the venom of his hatred and ex-

, peeled the same. It was not what]
got. However. miller than adiatribe
against Jews, this man's hatred
found other directions,

i heard while peoplecalled dov—
ils, the cast out of G-d who will
eventually bedestroyed. I heard the
word homosexual used in the same
breath with the words murder, rape,
incest, as if they were moral
equivalents. I heard talk of genetics
and racial superiority which
sounded as if it had been sent
through a huge bull hom from Nazi
Germany during aspeech by Adolf
Hitler. But, no matterhow wrong or
ridiculous the fact, be it that 70% of
America’s troops in the gulf were

( black or that white people were a
, product of grafting six Ihousand
years in the Caucus Hills, I did

nothing. I sat silent.

When I walked out I was angry
with what had been said, but I was
relieved in that he had said little
offensive about me. I wondered ifii
was really worth writing about in
this week‘s column. Now I‘m
ashamed.

There is a famous quote by the
theologian Martin Niemoller about
silence in the Holocaust. “First they
came for the unionists. but I said
nothing for I was not a unionist.
Then they came for the Catholics,
but I did nothing for l was not a
Catholic..." and it ends with the
lament of the nanator, “Now they
come forme. but there is no one left
to speak in my name.” I too was
going to let hatred go by
unchallenged for the simple reason
that it was not directed at me and
mine and now [am disgusted at my
own lack of commitment to basic
ethics. In the evening lecture his
hatred and lies grew even fiercer,

The great message of Islam, the
notion of true Brotherhood of all
Humans has been bent and twisted
into a notion of racial hierarchy
which woulddo a Klansman proud.
He attacked Catholics, explaining
that the Pope was a fraud. He added
a touch of the Aryan Nation to his
brew of hatred with an explanation
of a secret conspiracy of Freema-
sonsandJewsto Iakcovcrihc world.

I heard about how the Jews were in
league with Hitler and planned the
Holocaust, how they owned all the
slave ships which broughtAfricans
in chains to these shores, how Jews
controlled America with halfofthc
US. Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives being notonlyJeWish (a
lie) but also members of the Israeli
parliament (which incidentally has
only no seats). He spoke about
how Arab Muslims wcrc an “un-
rulypeoplcwho needed harsh laws”
to keep them from reverting to their
true White demonic nature, The
Minister spoke with contempt of
how the religions and cultures na-
tive to Africa were vile and not

THE REAL WORLD
Do not open until.

In collegealmosicverybody has
a sense of humor, for better or for

people have a tendency to take
