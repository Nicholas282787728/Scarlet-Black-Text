”Clothesline" for Sexual and Domestic Abuse on Display

By Riva Sharples

HIRTS made by survivors
of domestic and sexual abuse
and their friends and fami

lies are currendy on display in the
Forum The “Clothesline Project,"
which is pan of a nation-wide Cam-
paign against domestic abuse, was
started in 1990 by a women’s group
in Cape Cod. Kara Bakken, a Grin-
nell senior, organized the clothesline
project at Grinnell in order to “bear
witness to violence against women."
“Ithink(the reaction peoplehave
to theclothesline) is really personal,"
Bakken said. “Itdepends whatyou’rc
bringing into it. For people who
aren’t survivors, I hope the project
will raise awareness of abuse and
relate the survivor's experience. For
survivors, the project is a healing
process and knowing that one doesn‘t
have to be silent and that there are
others out there and that can be a
really empowering thing."
Oneineveryfourwomenwill be
involved in an abusive relationship,
according to Bakken. The National

Victim Center claims that one out of
every two women will be in aviolenl
relationship in their lifetime. Ac-
cording to the US. Justice Depart-
ment, “every single minute of every
day,morethanonewomanisrapedin
America.“ Survivors of Incest
Anonymous says that before the age
of 18, “one out of three girls and one
out of seven boys will be victlms of
Incest or sexual assault."

“1 think that the entire human
race suffers every time a woman is
raped,”shesaid. “The factthatoncin
four women is in an abusive relation
ship means that either you will be
abused, or someone you know will
be, so it‘s Important we all know
about and understand domestic
abuse."

Domestic abuse is defined as the
abuse of power in a relationship, ac-
cording to Grinnell Community Ser~
vice Center director Amy Eilert.

“Domestic abuse usually occurs
between men and women," she said,
“Thatabuse can be emotional, physi-
ea], or mental. It varies a greatdcal,
but basically, it’s control and power

of some sort over one‘s partner.“

Some abusive behaviors include
pushing. slapping, biting, kicking.
name-calling. mind games, threaten-
ing suicide, destroying property, con-
trolling who a person sees and where
he/shegoes, controlling the spending
of money, and forcing sex against
ones will, according to Domestic
Violence Alternatives of
Marshalltown.

Once a person is victimized,

There will be three student initia-
lives up for vote today. Voting Will
take place In the post office. Stu-
dents will need their 1D to vote.

1. We, the students of Grinnell
College, feel that current campus
lighting is Inadequate to insure stun
dent safety. We detntlnd there and
between lighting for campus, in the
form of true“ltght corridors" along
all wellrtravcled pathways dlrough
campus. To this end, weask Ihattlte
eastrwest pathway adjacent to
Burling Library, the pathway that
crosses the railroad tracks behind
the Science Building, the pathway
fromLoosel-[all to the SRC/YMCA,
thepathway from theForumtoARH.
and the pathway from ARI-l to the
Science Building all receive mor
lighting.

2. We, the students of Grinnell
College, feel that the deadline for
declaringthecoursepasS/failoption
should be moved from the first few
weeks of each semester to signifi-

 

Three SGA Initiatives
to be Considered Today

cantly later in the semester. The
current deadline falls before stu-
dents ctltt accurately assess the de-
mands whlch a given course will
placcon them and often before they
have received anyevaluation oflhctr
work from the course professor.
There Is no new for the deadline to
be this early, Professors are not
infortned of whether a student is
taking a class pass/fail until after
finalsanyway,andmovingthedead-
line would not, of course, prohibit
early pass/fail declaration tf a stu-
dentchosethisoptionearlyon in the
semester. No one benefits from
forcing students to make decisions
prematurely.

3. We, the students of Gl‘innell
College, advocate putting the Came
pus Memo on the VAX in order to
provide unlimited access to thc
Memo and prevent Memo short~
ages/Overprinting, Hard copies for
community members withoutcom»
puter access can be available in of-
fices around campus.

Indigenous rights, ”1056 rights of

emment, Byler feels that time con-
flicts could be lessened through diar
logue, Minorities need to feel some
sense of control and respect; the gov-
ertlment needs to turn to them for
consultation and treat them as valued
partners, not second class citizens.
Bylerfeelsdlatsomehumanrights
are indeed universal, and in order to
help stop Ihepcrsecution, tnany myths
need to be destroyed, Slteh myths are:
cultural practices are good because
they are partof the culture, all cultures
that contain human rights violations
are bad. people get the governments
they deserve, and governments speak
forall people, She feels that we need to
ask the victims how they feel, and
concentrate our efforts on what they
think needs to be done, She slated that
all we are really talking about is the
power of one group over another.
Through a question and answer
session following her talk, Byler
pointed out that human rights can’tbc
rated against each other; one is no less
valuable than another, but we must
concentrate on what the oppressed
think the violation is. “The real human
rights heroesarethose people who are
oppressed and ban together," she said.
