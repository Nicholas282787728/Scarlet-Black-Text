The outﬁts spotted by 12 fans from the women's bay
kethall team at the Midwest Conference Men’s Basketball
Tournament in Darby Gym last weekend said it all, They
were clad in white [carshlrrsy each sportingonc letter apiece,
spelling out the theme oFthe men’s season. “\V/rOrRrSrTr
TrOrFrerrsrT."

At the beginning otthe season. the Pioneer men's bas.
ketball rearri was picked by MWC coaches to finish last in
the coiiterener. By the end orthc regular season, the team
had ptovenrlts critics wrong, churned the MWC regular»
season championship and earned the right to host the
championship tournament.

13y dinner time Saturday, Grinnell had glvcn its critics
one more surprise: it had won rhe MWC tournament and
picked up an automatic berth in the NCAA-Division III
playoffs.

These surprises have been pleasant indeed for head
coach David Arseneault. “Any time you play into
March in Division 111, you're very happy," Atsenetmlt
said.

Few 1n the MWC picked Grinnell to survive to
March. a prediction which Arscncault said was justl-
ﬂed.

”From what other coaches ill the conference knew, it
was absolutely legitimate where we were placed,"
Arseneault said,

What they did not know. according to Arseneault, was
either how consistent the core of experienced Pioneers
would be at the beginnlng of the season or how effective
many younger players would turn out to be re the season
progressed.

On top ofeonsistcncy and ettcctiverlcss, the team added
Intangibles.

Arseneault said a little luck helped the team Stay hot
during the year “I'd have to say there were about ﬁve or
stx times this year where we tried to shoot ourself in the
foot, but we missed," he said. “Sometimes that’s what it
takes for a team to go on a run 7 a little luck."

Team chemistry played a part in Pioneer success, as
well.

“The team chemistry was phenomenal and, as a re-
sult, We were blessed with a great season," guard Cody
Skinning '01, said.

The great season did not end with the Grinnell’s ﬁrst
rcgnlnrrseason championship Klncc 19%: the team went
on to win the MWC tournament lastweekend with victo-
ries uver Belolt in the semifinals and Illinols College in
the ﬁnals.

solid play by Gtinnell may not have been the only
factor that led to the tournament win. Over 1,000 tarts
packed Darby for both games, and coaches and players
said the home court advantage played a big role,

“1 would have to be a fool to thinh that home court
advantage was not a huge part or our success" Skarning
said. “The support we received hem the school and the
town was unbelievable. 1 have never been more proud to
be a member orthe Grinnell student body. The entluisi.
asin they brought to the gym during the tournament was
commendable and much appreciated.”

berth in the NCAA tournament. Regardless or how
Gtinnell does in March, players said that this season was
something special.

“This was. without a doubt, the best season 1 could
have ever imagined," Skaming said,

“The opportunity to host the tonfetcnee tournament
was something 1 had dreamed about since my freshmen

fact that we were picked to ﬁnish dead last in conference
