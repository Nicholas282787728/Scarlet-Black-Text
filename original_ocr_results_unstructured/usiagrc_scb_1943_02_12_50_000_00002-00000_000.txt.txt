Nor Slaves, Nor Mas+ers--—

This day is the anniversary of the birth of
Abraham Lincoln.

Out of the health of philosophy and
comment that man left to the wor,ld there
should be many things quotable on Feb.
12 of 19497“ . . . this nation, conceived in
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal," or “ With
Illalice toward none, with charity toward
a . . , "

These we do not choose. For though
America-is once more engaged ill a great
war, there has been evidence enough to
wonder if that war is to test “whether any
nation so conceived and so dedicated can
long endure,” or to decide who Shall control
the oil fields of the east Indies, the grain
fields of the Caucasus, or the immeasurable
wealth of India.

The economic determinists of history
have answered that question for themselves.
Those of lls who prefer idealism to econom-
ics cannot, ill honesty, ignore their decis—
ion.

Mottos are lovely thing's, convenient in
illustrating a point. But it cannot be de-
nied that they have a sedative effect on in-
tellectual honesty. They fall almost-too
easily from the tongue in answer to all
qery. “The People’s War,” “The War to
Preserve Democracy," yes, even now, the
“Four Freedoms.”

But on the bilthday of Honest Abe,
honesty forces the question. Are we, in
World War II, seeking liberty or license?
Freedom for all or advantage for our side
as opposed to the other side?

This question could be termed as unpat-
riotic. We don’t think it is. We place on
the highest pinnacles of patriotism a spirit
which does not say “My country, right or
wrong," bllt rather “My countl'yiif she
isn‘t right then we're going to make her
right before we attempt to lead others."

If that is lack of patriotism, then Lin-
coln, too, was nnpatriotic. For among the
quotations of the great Emancipator is one
which, in honesty, We feel is the only one
really applicable to our situation. It is not
one of his ”inspiration” comments; it is,
if anything, a warning, one to be heeded
by our generation, who is fighting a war
on the keynote of opportunity, not respone
sibility.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

“I’m In the Army Now”

not be a slave, so I would not be a master.”

Lincoln never livcd to insure that this
llation would follow that motto If he had,
perhaps the lnore inspirational of his comv
ments would be used in honesty today. But
today we are forced to admit that “the new
birth of freedom” of which Lincoln spoke, is
not an achievement of our p‘ast, but only a
hope for our futur We have not proved
ourselves as yet in this natioll, frcc though

it may be in an unfree world.

If our motivation for war is not to
abolish slaves but to change their masters,
then the generation before us has failed.
If our decision, on the conclusion of this
war, is not to abolish slaves but to change
their masters, we will have fa iled.

In warning to ourselves at this beg, n-
ning of n year \ihich may bring victory, \ie
think of the Great Emancipatol as a man
of the lutuie, not the past; a man of whom
Ameiica must be w'olthy belore she can
be proud.

And in his highest honor, for ollr high,
est good, we repeat: as we would not be
slaves, so he shall not be masters.

Keep Iem Flying--- if

The first large exodus of men from this
campus for war service will occur within
the next week, as members of the Army air
corps reserve follow their orders to report
the third week in February.

Such a mass movement of ten percent
of the male student body is the sort of
thing that really means war. It is the type
of situation most of us had in mind on Dec
8, 1941, when we were sllre Grinnell would
be swept clean of men by Christmas

That was over a year ago. So far Grins
nell has been lucky, We have had a fllll
year of grace. But now tlle first big move
has come, and if ever before, the war is a
real thing to this school no '.

For those of us remaining in Grinnell
there is a touch of nostalgia perhaps. We
know how anxious the air corps men them-
selves have been to go, and we are proud
to see them display that attitude.

But more than that, we wish now, on
the eve of their departure to congratulate
them on an effort which time did not al-
low to mature fully.
reservists organized their Grinnell squadron,
the "Gremlins,” they were not just playing
at an exciting myth, or indulging their egos
in titles and orders, salutes and an officers’
club. They were beginning 'what we be
lieve would have come to be a fully-rounded
and significant pre light training program
of value to the war effort and to this cam-
pus as a center for the training of young
men. They are now unable to finish that
program, but it is a project worthy of ser-
ious consideration by other service groups
still on this campus.

Because they have shown initiative in
organizing the ”Gremlins,” because they
have shown they can work as a team he ‘e
in college and carry that cooperative spil t
over into a harder kind of study and skill,
because we know every one of them and are
proud of the justification they offer for
schools like this, we wish the members of
Grinnell squadron the best of luck.
