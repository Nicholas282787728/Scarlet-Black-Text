Nietzsthe and st. Augustine. “He's written
a lot otvery interestrng books," Culver sard.

Competition drives Hirschey,
both on and off the field

Nick Hirschey, a Math and Economics double major, plans to earn a Ph.d. in Finance

Competition seems to be a theme for
Nick Hirsehey, though his Competitors are
an unconventional combinatiol-l' football
players and complex math problems.

Hirsehey has been interested in ﬁnancial
markets and economics sinee third grade.
“The idea otmaking money by not [having
to do] anything in the stock market seemed
neat [at the time]," he said, He stayed inter-
ested. and is a Math and Economics double
major.

He also started on the offensive line as
it tackle on the Grinnell football team. U",
like Economicsmn interest in football didn't
start until his junior year of high school,
when he realized that “[he] couldn't throw
80 miles per hour and was too short to play
basketball."

Hirsthey says that he had already dc»
eided to go to college and thought it might
be am to play football whrle he was there. ”I
Came to Grinnell in part to play football,"
he said, “Also, Professor Montgomery rn the
Economics department ealled me. which
was really nree of him. [That] was also a big

reason for my coming here."

He said at times rt was difﬁcult to juggle
being a double major and being on an ath-
lerre team, bur not rmpo e. “At Grinnell,
[football] is not really g ng to prevent you
from doing well," he said. “It would have
made it a little bit easier [ifl hadn’t played],
but the reality is 1 probably would have just
wasted that time."

Hitschey said that when he’s wearing his
glasses “that it’s the joke among my friends
that that‘s the subtle math dork part of
me

But the next few years for I’III'SChCy will
involve a lot of math and economics and
very litde, ifauy, football. He will attend the
dottoral program in Finance at the Univer
sity oiTexasrAustrn, where he will be the
youngest person in the program, and hopes

to have his PhD. in (our years.

“The thrng thatl like about economics
is that it gives a trainework for how people
make decmons,” he said, “I like analyzing
things, and the thing about math is 1 really
like giving order to disordered systems and
breaking down really eompler problems into
the fundamental or basic Components."

Hirsehey said that the deeision to stay
at aeadernia and not enter the private settor
was a difficult one

“I decided tharl really wanted to think
instead or do things i really like solve
rng problems, so I really am a huge dork,"
he sard. “rm less interested in dealing with
people than ideas [and] I‘d rather be doing
research than going to a rneetmg,"

so instead or sitting in meetings and
managmg people’s money, Hitschey will
become a professor. And as for Football,
Hirsehey says he is done tor now “I'm deh-
nitely very llad I drd it and I have had a lot
atrun and ﬁlllve] lots otgood inemoties,”he
s d. “But I’m ready to move on. tin ready to

e a normal pcrson."
