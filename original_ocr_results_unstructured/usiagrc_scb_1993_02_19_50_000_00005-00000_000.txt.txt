FACES AND PLACES

Paul and his Life

Rebeka Meyer

EN interviewmg a person
forFacesandPlacc-r I like
to sit down with theperson

essentially unprepared and let the eon-
versation take us where it needs to. For
all three interviews that I’ve done I
knew very little about tile person, are
cepting a small lead from a friend ex-
plaining that the person was worth in-
terviewing.
Iwas given Paul Nettleman’s name
by a friend. One of the only things I
knew about him was that he is a really
neat guy who was very cool about his
sexuality. Otherwiseldidn’tknow what
to expect when] methimatThe Grill onSunday aftemoon.
Isat down and waited seveial minutes, trying to guess
what type of person I should be looking for. After a bit, a
neatly dressed man with shortblack hairand round tonoise
shell glasses, walked in carrying a backpack. The only
thing that keyed me in to the fact that it was perhaps Paul
was the small pin with a pink triangle on it, pinned to his
backpack. I introduced myself and we began to talk.
Paul‘s gayness is obviously a part of him and one
would probably not be all that surprised if after knowing
him for awhile to find out he was gay. But his “gayness”
isn’t the first thing that strikes someone when getting to
know him
One of the first things we talked about was Paul’s
experience in Japan, where he lived with his family from
the time he was twelve until he was nineteen. He explained
that he spent the first several years in a Japanese Junior
High and then ended up doing his high school years with
a correspondence course (although he admits thathe spent
most of the time in high school sitting around watching
daytime Japanese television shows).

seemed to be much more rigid in Japan, although he felt
that overall people were very similar in both societies;
both groups of people aspiringlobewealthy and successful.

When I asked about any special interests, one of the
first things he mentioned was that he likes to cook,
particularly] apanese andChinese food. I’ve been told that
his friends love his chicken curry.

Paul has played the piano since he was ﬁve years old,
He explained thatwhen he was young he really didn’t like
toplay. He said, although piano frustrates him attimes, he
does find it relaxing.

I found after talking with Paul for awhile, that one of
his most amazing qualities is his ability to listen For me,
as an interviewer this wasa bit difficult. It was hard to get
a picture of what he was really about because he wasn’t
very talkative. But despite this, the silent pauses in our
conversation ﬁlled with my own prattleshowed me some—
thing very important about Paul: his gentleness and his
genuine willingness to listen.
