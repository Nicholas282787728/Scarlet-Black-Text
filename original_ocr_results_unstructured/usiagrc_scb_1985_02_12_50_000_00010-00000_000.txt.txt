“Counter-Protest” was a misnomer

Last Friday I and a group oi other con-
cerned students held a demonstration to
protest apartheid and put [orward an idea
about what Grinnell should do about it.
Needless to say. i was stunned to read in
the last issue of this paper nothing but cone
(Iemnation of what we did. After reflecting
on the matter and attending a Students to
End Apartheid meeting, 1 iind the whole
Altair rather curious. and hence I will
devote my column to exploring this con-
demnalion

" e criticism which met our demonstrar
tion was twoiold, First it contended that
our proposal to the Trustees was seli-
serving punery designed to give support to
apartheid. Second. it asserted that not only
was our proposal Superficial and helpiul to
apartheid. it was also exactly what
Students to End Apartheid has been work-
ing tor. and was thereiore redundant! The
result was paradoxical comments like that
of the 5513‘s editor. who called our position
"obnoxious” and simply a chance for us to
"tseizel another opportunity to blow their
horns as conservatives" thereby en-
dangering "this College's eiiorts to end its
proxy support oi a Racist machine." At the
same time. however. this same position
was described as “no different than the
call made by Students to End Apartheid.”
when the dust settled, our position was
condemned [or being ignorant oi the facts.
