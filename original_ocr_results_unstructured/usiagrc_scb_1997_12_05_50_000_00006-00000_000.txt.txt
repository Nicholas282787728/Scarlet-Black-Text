Dear Editor:

I am currently abroad, arid (sadly)

tently. As a result, this is a bit he
lated, but I feel that I need to respond
to the November 4 article which ad-
dresses the activuies and concerns
ofGrlnnell Women in Science Afr
ter reading the article, I was rather
upset at some of the su lions I
found there, and I would like to chalr
lenge them, For starters. the term
“hard science" is an Incredibly obr
tuse choice of words. Using "hard"
as an adjective implies that the natue
ral sciences are inherently difficult,
an implieaiiori that women and men
find intimidating. Plus, that phrasing
suggests that the natural sciences
have a higher academic status than
the humanities or social sciences, an
insinuation I assure could be hotly
debated. My point, however. is not
to discuss whether or not the tennis
nology used was politically correct
oracourate. Instead, I want to address
Ms. Dingel’s suggestion that
“Grinnell Women in Social Seieiices/
Humanities" is not a necessary or-
ganization because these fields are
"more equal or female dominated "
Also, I would like to defend
Grinnell's natural science divrsion
from what I see as an unnecessary
attack.

According to Ms. Diligel. “There is
simply not the need to encourage
women to go into those fields [hu-
martities/social sciences] because
they are already there." I won‘t are
gue against the statistics, but il’numr
bets are the issue. then why is there
no organization encouraginv men to
enroll in education courses Typi-
cally, an education course is at least
thrcerquartet‘s female. Is this because
men are intimidated or discouraged
from educational careers? Or maybe
the problem arises because Grinnell
hasn't taken any “pro-active mea
sures" to encourage more men to take
interest in education.

On that note, I want to reply to Ms.
Booker’s assault against Griiiiiell's

OPINION

natural science division In the are
ticle, she stated that r “Grinnell has
lailetl in attiaciing women to many
of the sciences because it has not
taken any pl‘oetictllc measures to
ensure that the unyii-onnient for
women in the sciences is support-
ive " She goes on to point out the
absence ol lcniiile faculty in physics
and computer science This bothers
me for two reasons First. Ms
Booker failed to mention that the
chemistry. biology. and psychology
departments each have vcral
women on faculty, on inexcusable
and unfair mnrssron. Second. my
own erpcrienccs in the natural sci»
ctiee diVision have not becli "discour-
aging " Until recently, I was enrolled
as a Chemistry mayo and I took four
semesters in Chemistry, two in Phys-
ics. and two in Matli. During that
time. I lounri lhc rucuity incredibly
supportive and encouraging, and in
some cases especially because i am
a woman. '

IfGVVIS feels that an intimidating
atmosphere affects the nutnbcr of
women who choose a natural sclerice
major and stick wtth that decision.
let me be the first to say that my own
decision to leave the natural sciences
in no way reflects a negative Oplne
ion of the science (ilVISIOH, I chose
to follow my own dreams ratlrer than
the scientific path which I had been
directed to my entire life The decir
sion was very difﬁcult, however, be-
cause my experiences with the
Chemistry department antl faculty
had been so positive. Furthermore, I
am insulted at the implication that
intimidation might be blamed flu my
switch because it suggests that I. a
woman. am not strong or llldcpclle
dent enough to pursue my dreams
regardlessol’any obstacles that might
occur,

I don't intend this letter as an air
tack against GWIS as an (il'gallll‘d'
“0an believe their goals are adults
rable. However: I refuse to allow the
science division to he put under such
scrutiny without a challenge. Too
ortcrr. people are only told one side
ofa story and fail to ask for the rest.
Since that seems to he the current
situation, I‘m here to say that, despite
sortie lninor issues, the Gt iniiell Col-
lege natural science division is do-

ing tr fabulous job Perhaps that will
encourage more students. including
women. to set asidc their fears oftlic
'ei'il‘ science building anti give it tr
try in the future.

Dear Editor:

Wc nould like to answer a question

her 2|, W97 column. Why did the
swim team use supermodcls to ad
vcrlise their November 22 home
meetr Obviously because the swim
learn is FULL OF SUFERMODELS.

We don't think so.

On a. campus as PC as Grriinell's,
we would hope that students would
have at sense of humor If Ms.
Weslman had read the offending ads
carefully, she might have noticed that
the signs picturing supermodels
made fun ol'tltelrclieesy expressions
and ridiculously \vaifish rrguros.
Also, the siipcriliodel pictures cone
stituted only a fraction of the many

meet. We also Objecliﬁed feet, or-

this opportunity to sincerely apolo-

Scarlet r3 Black - Friday, December 5

Search,

volved in the effort to increase t'Cpr
resentation on the Presidential
Search Committee focused on Collie
miinication between students, “Even
after Gabe was elected and the re-
sults were posted, there were stu-
dents that didn't know about the
nominations, the election, or even
very much about the presidential
search,“ he said. Moseng also ex-
pressed hope that communication
betwcen students and trustees would
improve "Even if another student
does not make it onto ilic selection
committee, this should shock the
trustees into more consistent and
open communication with the stu-
dent body,"

In late November, the Board of
Trustees enlisted Dr. Alceste Pappas
to explore Grinnell College commu-
nity views. She spoke to students,
faculty, and administrators, cslabllslie
ing a preliminary report before the
search committee met, On Wediiese
day, December 3, the executive
search ﬁrm Heidrick and Struggles.
hired to assist in the presidential
search, was represented by one ofit's
chief officers. William J. Bowen, in
a series of meetings on campus.

In a letter to the Grinnell College
community, Chair ofthe Piesidcntial
Search Committee Caroline Little
said that “Mr. Bowen wrll [continue
to] assist the Presidential Search
Committee to develop a presidential
profile and descriptions of the Col-
legs for our use in the Search." He
gathered information in meetings
with support staff, iaoulty. adminis»
trative staff and students

Jones was present at Bowen's dis»
cussion with students She made use
other opportunity to voice her Opll’l'
ions, bringing up issues that minori-
ties must face. She voiced the need
for a support structure for minorities

and a stronger affirmative action pro
gram.

Hudson Heatley ’OI attended this
meeting. Heatley is generally pleased
with the search process to date. She
described Bowen and his associates
as "friendly and approachable." and
applauded Childress for reaching out
to groups on campus that might not
agree with her.

Heatley was, however, disap-
pointed at the low student turnout at
the focus group, “I was upset because
I think that a lot of the points that
were brought up were about issues
that the student body is very vocal
about on this campus," she said.
“How ironic is it that we were tell»
mg the consultants this, and there
were only ten of us there!"

“I think that the consensus was
that we need to focus on
muliticultural issues," Heatley said
or the meeting with Bowen. It was
this concern that sparked the move
to increase student representation on
the search committee. “Grinnell is at
a crux," Rodriguez said. “We're ﬁ-
nally coming to terms with the fact
that diversity is not all that it‘s
cracked up to be here. A president is
going to come here and inﬂuence the
way things can go for a long time."
Rodriguez and other students are
concerned that issues of diversity
will be overlooked unless there is a
strong minority presence on the
board. .

“We choose to believe that the
Trustees are just old white republie
can men," Bell said She defended
their decision to keep only one stu-
dent on the board, saying “even ifall
the Trustees do fit this proﬁle. that
doesn't mean they are against diver-
sity." Bell did not ﬁnd the recent
election necessary. “I have enormous
respect for this movement and their
principles, IJust think it IS somewhat
misguided."
