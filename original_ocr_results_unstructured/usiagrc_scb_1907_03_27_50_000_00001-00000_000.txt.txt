year the competing academies were
ioiya Wesleyan Academy and iowa

College Academy. The representar
lives of the former school were Messrs.
Schwietert, Eimmeu and Deal; at the
latter MESSI‘S. Edgington, Mclx'eiilr
and Wilson. The question discussed
was the proposition to prohibit the
issuance of injunctions in labor disn
pures bytlie Federal Courts. The
atiirmntive was taken by Grllmeli. and
the negative by Iowa Wesleyan.

One leading criticism of the debate
in general is the iantbhatthwpposing
sides (lid not clash throughout upon
tlieissue. The negative built their
case lipou an assumption which the
atlirrnative discovered and exposed in
rebuttal. The aiiil'mative excelled in
presenting a delinite issue, and a clear
out case, which they protected in r
blittal, throughout which they easily
bested their opponents. The negative
ignored the issue and discussed the
general principle oi itll injunctions, a
matter which entered into the ques-
UDH only in a. minor way. All the
speakers made a favorable impression
and tile debate as a “hole “as satis-
factory. Thaiurlges were, Attorney
Stone oi Marshalltown, Attorney Corr
Hell of Ortumwa and Professor Calvin
of Iowa City.

ever, in all but the basket ball game,
scoring very close [a the home team

shorted excellent team work through-
out, each man scoring good points
though in some cases the work was
not as good as anticipated. Wells on
the horizontals did especially good
work.

The system of scoring was rather in
iavor oi the Normal. Had points been
counted ior ursc, second and third, as
in a ti'aclr meet, Gi'innell would have
iar outstripped her opponents, for
she would have taken the ﬁrst two
places in every event Coach Rule, or
