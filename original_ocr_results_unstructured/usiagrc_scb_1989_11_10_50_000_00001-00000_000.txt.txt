Burglar Strikes SIX Dorms

By Jennifer Watson
and Brendan Shepherd

A burglar hitat least six dormito—
ries early last Sunday morning,
walking through unlocked room
doors and stealing cash, cameras,
radios andkeys while students slept.

The burglar touched one student
in bed, waking her up, while other
studenu said the man apologized for
disturbing them.

The burglar hit both North and
South Campus. The dorms burglar-
ized include James, Clark, Dibble,
Langan, Gates and Younker Hall.

Steven Jones, assistant dean of
studentaffairs, said thatonly six stu-
dents reported break-ins, and four
reported thefts of items rangingfrom
varying amounts of cash to cameras
and radios.

The thieves also took two sets of
room keys, thereby gaining access
to all residence halls. Locks to the
rooms with stolen keys were changed
Sunday.

Les Olinger, assistant director of
plant operations, said there was no
evidenceof forced entry, He said the

A report released this week
by the college’s Committee for
a Stronger Minority Presence
has some bold suggestions for
the administration, including
adding ten black faculty mem-
bers,creatinganadminisuative
position to oversee faculty di-
versity and adding to the mi-
nority admissions staff.

The report also urged the col-
legetoestablishendowedchairs
for minority studies, to create a
minority writers’ workshop and
to make recnritment of minor-
ity students more agressive.

The report said college presi-
dent George Drake should
“identify Grinnell nationally
and internationally as a mecca
for multicultural education and
thought."

The committee, made up of
eight black alumni, met on
campus in September with
Draker

One of the committee’s sug»
gestions was to establish an ad—
ministrative position, the vice
president of human resources,
who would be a minority
member and who would moni-
tor minority issues in stafﬁng.
Drake said he is undecided on
the position.

“We are certainly consider-

ing that idea, maybe not in that
form, but a high administra-
tive position focused on miv
nority matters," he said.

Another suggestion was to
hire 10 black faculty, with at
least three tenured w a sugr
gmtion that Steven Jones, as
sociate dean of studentaffairs.
said is reasonable.

“Recruitment and retention
go hand in hand. How an indi-
vidual feels welcomedintothis
community will determine
whether he or she will stay,”
Jones said.

Drake said that although all
the recommendations were
worthy of consideration, the
college is not trying to achieve
all of the suggested goals.

“It was not the committee’s
intent, nor is it the college‘s
intent, to establish these rec-
ommendations as blueprints to
be accepted without devia-
tion," he said.

Grinnell‘s main emphasis
right now is on the recruitment
of minority faculty. though
other programs remain impor-
tant, administrators said.

Jones agreed. “Our focus is
trying to figure out the
college's plan for a multirculr
rural community," he said.

5 Students Plead Guilty

to Involvement in Fight

By Diane Brumley

Five Grinnell students pleaded
guilty Tuesday in Grinnell magis-

. Irate court to charges of disorderly

conduct stemming from a fight on

‘ Saturday, Oct. 22 with local teen-

agers.
Ara Eulbulian, Chris Gingerich,

» David Hess,leffreyShook and Scott
‘ Whipple were each fined $77.50 for

their involvement in the fight. The
fight began in the Bar as verbal harv
assment, moved outside onto Main
St. and ended in an alley when a
passerby drew a pocketknife and cut
the throat of one of the townspeople
involved.

Police said the cut was not life»
threatening.

The court tumed down their re»
quests for deferred sentences. Under
a deferred sentence, each man’s
charges would be erased from Pow-
eshiek County records under the
condition that a period of time pass
during which no charges be ﬁled
against the men.

The judge denied their request for

a deferred sentence because two of
the local residents had already en-
tered guilty pleas, and the charges
had already been entered on their
records.

The restofthelocalresidentshave
court appearance dates set for next
Tuesday, Nov. 14. Following their
sentencing, the case wtll then be
closed, except for the trial of Shah-
zait Ahmad, the passerby who some-
how became involved in the fight.

Ahmad, whois from Pakistan,was
visrting his girlfriend at Grinnell
when he became involved in the
brawl. He is being sought by police
in New York City. where he attends
Queens College. Ahmad has been
charged with willful misconduct, a
class C felony.

A trial date for Ahmad will be set
here in Grinnell following his extraa
dition from New York.

Also charged for disorderly con-
duct were Grinnell residents Mike
Kreigcl, Chad Burkett, Mike Hunter,
Mike Bown and the victim, Dennis
Moore. All are between the ages of
18 and 19 l

Women Reach 30% of Grinnell Faculty;
College Surpasses ’77 Recruitment Goal

By Kim Eckart

The college’s 1989790 affirmar
tive action report, released this week,
reveals that 30 percent ofGrinnell’s
leaching faculty are women, an in-
crease of over 3 percent from last
year. The figures show that the col-
lege has surpassed its 1977 affirma-
tive action goal of a teaching faculty
composed of 25 percent women.

According to Bill Deminoff, spe-
cial events coordinator for Grinnell' 3
afﬁrmative action committee, this
year’s increase is the most signiﬁ-
cant gain in the number of women in
the college’s history.

“We’ll do even better than that as >

time goes on," Deminoff said.
Some faculty members maintain,

however, that although there is a

sign of progress in these figures,

"Thefaculty hasdone much better
at recruiting than the upper echelon
of the administration,” said Roberta
Atwell, professor of education.

Of the seven executive adminis-
lrative positions which have opened
up in the past 10 years, only one has
been filled by a woman.

“Quite obviously, we have to be
doing better than this," said Demin-
off.

The number of women scattered
among the ranks of the faculty is
another notable aspect of the report.
Only 8.8 percent of full professors
are women, whereas women com»
prise 57.1 percent of the instructors.

thereremains work to be done. “This ,

is certainly an improvement over
when I ﬁrst came here, but there is
still a ways to go,” said Jennifer
Michaels. a German professor.
The college’s executive admini~
stration is cited in the report as an
area whichneeds morework.Forthe
past three years, all executive posi-
tions have been held by men. In

» contrast. women predominate in the

lower levels of the administration;
the number of women in non-execu—
tiveadministraliveposilionsexceeds
the number of men by 14 percent.

The positions of instructor and assis-
tant professor were the areas whrch
showed the largest increases in
women. Dem inoff said that progress
begins at the entry level and steadily
moves up the ranks.

Generally, there is a minimum of
six to seven years before achieving
rank, faculty members say. There-
fore, it may just be a matter of time
before there is a large increase in the
number ofwomen in the higherranks
ofthe faculty.

“Assuming that several of our
female associate professors remain
