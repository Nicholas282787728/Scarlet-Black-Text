Annoying but
efficient?

Vote, cont. from p. 1

Logan Lewis ’07 agreed that the »
methods appeared extreme to him.
“Vthn you get asked by the same pcr-
son three times in an hour and a halfif
you're vorcd, or whcn you say you don't
want a sticker and then when you turn
around to walk away and they start to
put onc on your backpack, that crosses
the line," Logan said,

Campus Democrats acknowledge
that trying to get every student to vote
might mean irritating some in the pres
cess. Cerchair Hannah GardenrMonr
heir '08 conceded that “sometimes you
need to annoy a couple of people to get
to the one person who needs ir, and
that person usually thanks us."

Chris Johnston ’09, who is not in
Campus Democrats, agreed with Gar-
denerlonheit. “Palmer won by just
about as much Democrats who voted
on campus,” Johnston said. “The goal
ofa campaign is to tell people to go out
and vote. I think they did everything
they needed to do. It annoys people but
it works."

Uncertainty remains over service funding

The recently published position paper on the col-
ltgc’s srmtsgrc plan was quick to highlight Grinntil‘s
history of promoting “socially responsible leadership.”
But as the semester continues, many of Giinncll‘s
community service leaders are growing frustrated
with a lack ofﬁnancial support from thc college.

GtInnell has historically providccl substantial sup-
port for community scivrce and continues to do so. A
policy change last year by Alumni Relations led to a
shortfall ofniote than $10,000 in funding. Continued
growth in community service, particularly by expen-
sive Alternative (Alt) Break trips, has also made the
situation more difficult.

SGA has made up the shortfall by providing
$10,000 this year for community service. SGA leaders
havc madc ir clcar that thcy do not inttnd to continuc
this ﬁlliding forever, lcaving groups with tho prospect
ofcithcr having to find new sources offunding or cut-
ting hack activitics. 94 pcrccnt ofvottrs supportcd an
SGA-sponsored studcut initiativc calling for thc col-
lege to incrcasc its community service funding.

Until last year, groups could solicit rcstrictcd do-
nations from interastcd alumni through Alumni Res
lations. Faccd with cousisrcntlylow alumni givIIIg,the

The Community Service Center, criricntly man-
aged by RLC jcnnitcr Bienick, currently opctatcs
with an annual hudgcr of 531,320, said Tom Cmdy,
Vice President for Student Sewlces. Alt Bl'ﬂrik c
diriarors estimate that two thirds of the total sctyicc
hudgct is allocated to thcir programs cach ycat, lcav-
ing roughly $10,000 for thc yearlong opcrations of
more than eight other service groups.

Despite the change, crady said funding will re—
rnain at levels similar to previous years.

Sewice coordinators and SGA still see a problem,
and the now SGA fund has helped many groups con-
tinue their activities.

“SGA has been suppottlve on a wrdc level," said
Katie Jitres ’07, who coordinates weekly Prison Wrir-
ing Workshops at a medium-security prison in Ncw-
ton. Jarcs said the rising cost otgas and transportation
wcrc major ohstaclcs for groups applying fol limitcd
funds. “No onc wants to pay for gas mancy,"Jatcs said.
“On one hand, I understand, but college kids don’t
havc cars, and ol‘ttn don't make cnough moncy” to
cover related costs.

RcNew participant and voluntccr Amy Rothhauni
'08 said she "came to Grinncll because of how the

group accomplished its goals for the
election. “We wanted to elect Eric
Palmer. We succeeded," Slilcrenbeck
Sﬂld. “We wanted to kcep Boswell in
the House We succeeded."

Chris Hall '07 is a family friend of
newly clcctcd Democratic Governor
Chet Culver, as well as SGA Presir
dent. He said Culvcr’s election and the
Democrats’ legislative takeover bodcd
well for the future.

“The fact that Democrats got both
the state house and the state senate

.. definitely opens the door to mak-
ing some good progress," Hall said.
“it should he. a good year, not only for
Dcmocrats but for just people in gen-
eral I feel extremely warm inside,"

Some students had m't\'ed tcclings
about the election results. Soleil Ho
'09 was optimistic that thc changcs in
Congress “will make things hardcr for
the president," but expressed disapr
pointmenr at some of the initiatives
passed by individual states. "The results
also meant ri ban on sam sex marriage
in Colorado which is disappointing as
hell," Ho said,

With so many changes in the com—
position ofthe government, Americans
are now waiting to see what this means
in the years approaching the 2008
presidential clcction. Justin Ahramson
'08 thought the coming two years had
peril as wall as promise for Dcmocrars.
“Democrats now have to do something
with it, otherwise thcy're going to have
a much toughcr rimc than they would
normally with the prcsidcntial clocrion

Crady said that “the real rub“ is that “the number
of students who want to be involved with Alt Break
has skyrocketed. The demand has far outgrown the
previous triads."

And while he and other administrators can help
with funding criscs, that comes at a cost. “Alt Break
