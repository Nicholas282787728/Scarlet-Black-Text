0 THIS IS AN EMERGENCY 0

At this writing, the fall of Singapore is
imminent.
Manila has already fallen.

The United States fleet was severely
crippled.

A 50 billion dollar war budget is up be-
fore Congress.

We are at war with two of the migh-
tiest military machines in the history of
the world—Germany and Japan, _
And so it our duty to inform a portion

of the student body that:

1. Spring vacation is a minor matter,

2. The Junior prom is inconsequential.

3. Compulsory physical training is a
must—not only because President Stev-
ens wants selfsdiscipline, but because the

America is engaged in a war—a total
war. It is a battle in which everyone will
have to sacrifice individual rights for the
final aJlsout victory of the nation.

The sooner we understand this basic fact,

0 War Hits Home.

For those people who have had their
heads stuck in the sand since the war he
gan, the past few days must have been a
real jolt. Acceleration, shortened spring
vacation, mass physical education have all
acted like a swift kick to the students who
persisted in believing that it won’t affect
115.

However, today the war really hit home,
and hard, for Grinnell‘s first man called out
of school for active duty since the conflict
began left this morning, Bob Huff is the
first, to be followed by many others, of
course, but the number one is always due
some fanfare,

It is not, however, that fact that is so
important, It is rather that the war has
delivered is first solid blow on school life.
Each day, each paper, will bring to our in-
dividual lives the shock of war, and we
must be prepared for it. It is too late to
wake up tomorrow; we must come alive
today! To fail to do so is to fail ourselves,
our school and our country. -

O
os----.gll

Cheer up, Grinnell! A certain well-known
season is coming. (Name witheld because
Japanese Spies might be lurking about the
campus.) And what’s more, it’s coming
within the next couple months.

The first robin has already packed his
grips to start north; radish seeds are stirl‘»
ing under the snow.

And, most important, the equinox has
been reached and the sun has started its
journey upward to the higher heavens, so
that the days are becoming longer and the
skies brighter.
