A large ' audience enthusiastically
greeted Henry James Dotterweich at
his first appearance in recital before
a Gl'lllnell audience last night. The
concert was the opening number of
the School of Music, Recital Course,

Mr. hottcrweich showed that he un-
derstood concert playing and lived up
to his post reputation in this respect.
The warmth with which he was greet—
ed and the encores given were as good
proof as could be offered to show the
enthusiasm of the audience.

If anyone were to ask what the cute
standing characteristic of the recital

‘ was, it would have to he admitted
that hrilliancy and life throughout the
whole program was the outstanding
feature Mr. Dottcrwcicli played each
number in a slightly faster tempo than
usual, which had the effect of eliminat—
ing any monotony which might have
otherwise been evident.

Possibly llr. Dotterweicb found his
audience unusually critical at first, or
else hard to more, for he did not be—
conic wrapped up in his playing until
rather late on the program. But when
he did, particularly in the Bl'uhms
Scherzo, it showed that a genome in-
sp ation could be placed behind his
playing.

The same brilliancy that character
ized all his playing was predominant
in the opening number on the program,
Sonata, op. 30, by Beethoven. The
staccato notes in this selection were
particularly clear and distinct. The
second number, Schumann's Carnival,
op. 9, was played somewhat faster
than when heard by Grinnellians dur—
ing the past year. The opening “pre-
hmble" was exceedingly difficult, yet
it was played with plenty of contrast
in the foi-tissimo passages.

One of the evenings favorites was
Mozart's Pdstul‘alc var c. In this the
singing melody was made to stand out
plainly above a brilliantly played up
pling obligatto.

Probullly the best rendered of all
the numbers was the hcavy Brahms
Scherzo. This was played with an
unusual amount of vigor and life even
in its most difficult passages. Herc,
probably more than in any other sc-
lection, Mr. Duttel'welch lost himself
completely in his nu .

definitely dccidcd, but it will be held
before the 15th of iie » larch in order
to come before the Western Conference

ve ties of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois.
Chicago, and others.

ning gymnasium team she will in all
probah be cntcrcd in this meet at

in one of the hottest fought games
ever played on Ward Field, that is
from the standpoint of temperature,
the Scarlet and Black aggregation this
afternoon romped all over Simpson’s
eleven, piling up a score of 5870.

Watt and Augustine covered them-
selves with glory by marvelous open
field running in the whole game. This
was made possible only by the splendid
interference furnished by Barret,
Grant and Day. Day's success with
"shoestring" passes brought him into
the limelight, while Raffety stands out
as the man who has opened the scor-
ing in both‘games this year by block-
ing punts back of the goal. All of the
line played a fine game, opening road-
ways through the Simpson wall al-
most at will. Team work was evident
and substitutions decreased the men
efficiency not the least.

.In the second half, Flock and Schulz
starred with their long end runs. Au—
gustine was also put in as quarter in
this period creditably.

The Fir Quarter.

The first quarter had barely started
before Raffety blocked Simpson’s
punt for a tonhcdown. Augustine
kicked goal easily. Dunnagon receiv-
ctl the next kickolf and returned the ’
[bull to the 25 yard line; but Simpson
tumbled on the next play and Bohlman
recotored on Simpson's 19 yard line.
A filtccn yard penalty for holding
helped Simpson block Gl'lllllell's on—
slaught. Augustine placed a drop kick
between the posts from the 20 yard
line, bringing the score to 10-0 in
Gl'iuncll's favor.

After receiving the next kickofl,.
lSimpSull made first down on her 58
yard line, but were soon forced to
punt, and watt ieturncd to Simpson’s
33 yard line. The rest of the period
was featured by the open [icld l'uu<
ning of Watt, one of his runs crossing
the goal, but the ball was returned for
pcnalty on account of holding. Tho
quarter ended, GI inuell 10, Simpson D.

Second tgiitii-tvr.

The second quarter started with‘
Grinnell’s hall on the 2 yard line.
Giant made one yard and "limo” car—
rieil the ball over. He kicked goal.
Score, 1770. A fumble on tlic kickoff
cost Simpson 5 points when watt
scooped it up and tore across the goal.
Augustine kicked goal. Sc‘oi-c, 2+0.

After receiving, Simpson was held
and forced to pinit. Watt returned 20
yards and followed quickly with a 30
yard run for a touclido , which, with
a goal by Augustine, brought the score
to 31. The same proccdnrc was fol-
lowed immediately with a 23 yard
smash by Day and a forward pass calm
ricd across the llllc by Watt. 'Seore,

The next and last touchdown of the
Llillf was made on a "shoestring" to
Day after the hall had been biought
to the 20 yard line by a series of end
runs and slllilsllcs. “Mike" missed
goal. The score, 44-0.
