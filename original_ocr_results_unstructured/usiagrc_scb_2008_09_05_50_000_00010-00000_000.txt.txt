after that felt great from miles two to 12. “For a while he was
going really slow," said Hammand.“But after a while we had
to try to keep up with him."

Then at mile 14, long before Paige himself lost power, his
iPod did, making miles 14 to 17 a struggle. “I just wanted to not
stop and not puke and not poop in the pool,"
Paige said, citing the condition that affects
marathon runners, when their bodies lose
control from exhaustion, “My body was so in
that state of athletic performance I couldn't
go to the bathroom.”

When Paige’s ﬁngers and toes \Vcnt numb,
he realized he could not see quite clearly and
said he became seriously contemed. “I think
I had some sort or sensory depravarion, My
mind was just shutting om eould feel it hap-
pening, I saw very strange things"

In all, Page swam a grand total of 693 laps, or just over
21 miles, the width of the English Channel. During his swim,
Paige took ﬁve-minute breaks every two hours to eat and go to
the bathroom.

While the 26-mile mark wasn‘t reached,thete is little doubt
in anyone's mind that Paige’s goal was not only leached, it was

shattered. "Even in the swimming world, less than one out of
100 people have done what he’s done,“ Hammond said. “I was
very impressed with him having the courage to decide when it
was safe to stop."

And lfyuu aslt Paige, he toothed his goal on Saturday be
fore he had even touched the writer. “I had a swim coach once
that rold me all the preparation and everything
you need to feel good about you get done be
fore your race even starts," he said. “When I
hopped into the pool and the noi went ourl
had alreadyhcen proud oreverything I had ale
ready done. Even at that point before I'd even
done anything."

While one of Paige's main goals was to
inspire others with CMT, it was instead they
who ended up inspiring him. one woman
identified only as Anita who has a severe case
of CMT learned or Paige’s swim and was inspired to ateom-
plish her own feat. “Because ofwhat 1 did she decided she was
going to step out of the box and step out otwhat she had been
doing," Paige said. “And she went parasitiling. And she sent me
some pictures of it, which is amazing to me. It really made me
feel inspired."

The swim team knew that it had to do whatever it could to
make sure that Paige could reach his goal. “we
realized that for him to do something like this
on his own would be an impossible feat,” said
Paige's teammate Ian Warlitlt '10, The swim
team took tnins swimming with him so he‘d
never be alone in the watei.

“It was kind of humbling to realize how
much he was willing to do for this,"Warlick said,
who said he was tired even after swimming with
Paige for just a mile.

“It kind of puts the things you bitch and
whine about in perspective." said Warlielt.

ney. “They supported me every single one o
rhem." Paige said of his teammates, who offered
constant encouragement, donated money, and
spread the word about the event by putting up
signs and posters. “They swam with me because
they believed in me and they believed in what I
was doing," said Paige. “I couldn’t ask for better
family than that."

BEN BREWER In addition to his mother and the swim team,

there was a larger family that rallied around Paige as well, and
it’s a family we‘re all a part of. ”The most moving thing to me is
that people who didn’t even know me came together and rallied
around me for a disease that they hadn't heard or,"said Paige of
the Gtinnell community. “We do that stuff for each other. And
everybody deserves thanks for that.”
