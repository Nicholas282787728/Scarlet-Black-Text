one worn by Mr. Williston as a
member of the 1892 track team.
Made of red silk. it has the letters
“I, c." in black silk across the face
These letters were changed to the
severe Gothic “G” which now ape

Frosh Drill

for Cornell

Teal-n Prepares for Tilt
With Drake Griders
Here Saturday

By Wells Barnett
The Pioneer football squad went
through an intensive scrimmage to
polish up the defense Tuesday
night in preparation for the HomE~
coming game wlth Drake Satur~
day. Monday. all men who played
against washburn last Friday
were excused from scrimmage.
while the second team drilled
against the freshmen.

Although students and faculty
members were admitted to Tues-
day's practice, all persons un-
known to one of the coaches were
barred from attending. a procedure
which is to be followed the re~
maindcr of the week, according to
Coach Guy Lookabaugh.

Loolmhaugh Silent

Although Lookabaugh isn't says
ing much about what he is doing
in preparing for Drake. he did in-
dicate the possibility of severai
new plays and of a few new faces
in the line-up Saturday. However.
the changes in the line-up are
only tentative at present, and it is
very likely that the lineup which
started against Washburn last
week will again function against
Drake.

The men who started the Wasln
burn game. and who will probably
start against Drake. are: Evans
and Schlotterbcck at halfbacks;
Snow at quarter, and Sampson at
fullback. Ricky Holler will hold
down left end. wim either Graves
or Osborne at left tackle. Wood-

To Meet Purple Gridders
Here Saturday

Pioneer freshman gridders will
open their season Saturday lnornr
ing at it) o'clock when they meet
the Cornell trash on Ward field in
one of two grid games scheduled
for the Homecoming program.

J. c. Truesdale. freshman menr
tor. declined to pick a starting
lineup. but from the performance
of the freshmen Tuesday night.
the following men will probably
start: left end. Strykcr; left
tackle, Grimes; left guard. Cogge-
shall; center, Jones; right guard,
Laniberson; right tackle, Whitley;
right end, Ward; quarterback.
Nash; left halfback, Crabb; right
halfback, Shelton or covey; full-
back, Sears.

sears will probably take charge
of the passing duties. while the
kicking will be taken care of by
any one of a number of backs. The
quarterback will act as game cape
tain.

Max Shelton. former high school
star in Des Moines. is the only
man on the injured list. He‘ in-
curred an ankle injury and a
slight back injury in practice re-
cently.

Negotiations are still being Car»
ried on for another game for the
freshman schedule. according to
Mr. Truesdale. Under the Mis-
souri Valley conference rules for
freshman football games, each
team‘is allowed two games, but as
yet ‘the Grinnell athletic depart-
ment has been unable to complete
negotiations for another contest.

Last year the Grinnell freshmen
played the Cornell preps. and lost
by a margin of 12-6. The game was
played at Mt. Vernon as part of
the Cornell Homecoming program.
