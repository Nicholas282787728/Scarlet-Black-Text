It is impossible to single out every

cal comment. Special praisc, how-
ever, is due nussen Gray who took
ovcr the 'part or Mr. Goodhind upon
Ishort notice and rendered it with coir
spicuous success.

I Special mention too should he made
or the part or Grubbv. one of tho in-

’acter he became one of the most con-
vincing because the illusion was so
c‘omplete. Dramatically the couch
he essays is important because it

anything else in the play.

Perhaps one may be pardoned thc
observation that although the author
intends a good deal ocirouy, the play
ollcrs to certain types of thinking no
satisfactory answer to the question it
puts so forcibly. In the light of the
action, was Jerry Goodkind the Fool.
was it his lather, was it Clare Jewett,
or by any chance was it, after an, the
