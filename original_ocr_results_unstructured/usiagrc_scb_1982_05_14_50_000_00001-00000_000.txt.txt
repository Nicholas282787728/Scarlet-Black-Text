Trustees consider SASG compromise, new chairman

by Mike Alexander

“The Trustees." Oh, how often we've
heard that label this semester. To many
students they represent Power, Money and
Power. When the administration isn't a
convenient scapegoat to blame for
something “wrong“ around here, one can
always pass the buck to the trustees. Or at
least that seems to be a common feeling on
campus. Last weekend, however, students
could go beyond the myth to the realitv.

At 1:30 pm. Friday, there came the
trustees' open forum in South Lounge.
Twelve trustees were there, including
Chairman Fritz Maytag. '

Dave Cooke, off-campus SGA president,
started things off by reading the trustees
the letter that SGA had approved, calling
for Dean Frazer to resign one of her posi
tions, either as administrator or instructor
oi philosophy. Cooke claimed that Frazer
had “fused the two roles" and pointed at
the Magurshak tenure decision as
evidence of Frazer's conflict of interest in
action, When a question arose as to
whether the letter actually represented a
campusconsensus decision, Cooke and
Jim Rabchuk presented the ad-
ministrative authoritarianism petition as
evidence oi campus support. despite the
fact that the petition had been introduced
over two weeks before the Frazer letter
had been presented to the campus and
SGA took no measures to illicit campus
opinion since then, _

The SGA letter led the discussion into a
regurgitation oi the Magurshak decision
and the tenure process in general. Maytag
responded by saying, “It is extremely unr
iortunate, but in the next three years, one-
fifth of the faculty (23 membersl will come
up for tenure. A lot of people are going to
be turned down.”

Regarding the Magurshak case
speciiically, Maytag crypticaliy said, “I
probably know less about it than I should
know and I probably know more about it
than I should too." Yet, when Lance lsen
responded, “i am horriiied that you sup
port something that you know very little
about," Maytag appeared to contradict
himsell by saying, “I know quite a bit
about the situation." He added, “President
Drake was correct. He’s doing a fantastic
job and has the right interests at heart."

Finally, an hour into the torum, the
discussion moved on to something other
than tenure and Magurshak. Student Brian
Gratch asked the trustees whether there
were plans for a construction of a fine arts
iacility “for displaying all of the rotting
artwork being Stored down in Fine Ars'
basement." Trustee Jim Lowry jokingly
commented, “Oh, it’s not rotting, it's just
sort oi iading away.” No one laughed and
Emily Earhart, student-director oi the
Negative Space Gallery, emon'onally in
formed the trustees of the hundreds of
works “just being leit clown there in a
basement that’s been declared a fire
hazard." The trustees took the comment
seriously and listed some oi the College's
priorities. Mention was made of the
library, Mears and other projects. such as
the completion of the dorm renovations,
the building oi a new psychology depart-
ment facility and the renovation of Grin-
nell House.

Finally, the forum discussion turned to
the inevitable topic of what to do about
Grinnell’s investments in corporations
operating in South Atrica. Maytag flatly
stated, "We're not going to divest, The
situation is detestable, we know, but it's
not the situation, it's what we can do about

The South African Support Group demonstration last Friday culminated in a sit-in
during a trustee meeting in Windsor House. Approximately 100 students crowded into
the house to hear members of SASG discuss divestment with the Board of Trustees.

i " Lowry, who has been in South Africa,
said, “Every college in the country can
divest every penny it has invested in South
Africa, and itwon't makea damn bit of difs
ierence, The change is power — we have to
get the people in power to relinquish it."
Chris Lehmann, SASG member, exclaims
ed, “By being involved in South Airica,
Grinnell is taking a moral position non.
They are still reaping the beneiits oi an
apartheid.”

During their later meetings, the trustees
approved tenure for Professors Peter
Druian (psychology), Andrew Hsieh
(history) and Robert McKibbin (art).
They also discussed Grinnell's tenure pro
cess in general. New officers were elected:
Robert Burnett is the new chairman of the
board, with John Chrystal and Patty Floyd
taking on the positions of Vice-
Chairpersons.

However, the big issue tor the trustees,
again, was divestment, which took up
about 50 percent oi discussion time.

At 4:30 pm, students, faculty members
and administrators gathered across the
street from Windsor House, where the
trustees were meeting. Between alter-
nating periods oi rain and sun, the crowd
sang, chanted, ate and waited Professors
Gurira, Magurshak and Wall gave pro
divestment speeches, which successfully
added to the rather angry enthusiasm
which pervaded the atmosphere and feel-
ings of those assembled. At approximately
4:50 p,i'n,, SASG representatives Joel Rob-
bins, Larry Hecimovich, Laura Heller,
Jim Hunter and Robert Schwartz went in
to meet with the trustees and deliberate
the issue.

An hour and a half later, Robbins emerg-
ed from the house, “I'm very upset," he
stammered. Suddenly, students were cryv
ing, “Let's go in," and people started pourr
mg into the house and into the meeting
room, while various SASG members hands
ed out fliers titled “Instructions for Civil
Disobediance,”

The trustees didn’t seem greatly af—
fected by the commotion, and the delibera»
tron continued between the board and the
SASG members. Maytag was saying, ”We
are very impressed with you Grinnell
students, your sincereity, your energy
your thoughtiulness 7," when Heller in-
terrupted: “More talk — nothing but talk
— that iswhatwe’re angry about. We don't

get any coherent response, all we do is
chat, Wc ieel you think you‘re doing
nothing wrong."

Waldo Walker, executive vice-president
of the college, interjected, “The board has
been impressed The impression has been
good, But you can't just sit down and ex
pect them to give you an answer " Lowi'y
echoed Walker's comments: ”You did
good work You want Us to take action, but
it will not be taken today."

Robbins said, "We can't keep doing this
and you keep saying no 01 course we're
emotional; we've been doing this for two
years and you still won‘t give us an
answer. It’s your turn to iind some
justification Let's have a least some con-
crete statement 7 people have no feeling
ior your empty gestures." He continued,
“When you're in power, you don’t have to
work too hard to back up a decision — you
can justsay no. Our problem is, should we
keep working, or should we just go home?“

At this time, Hunter proposed a come
promise:

1) The board initiate stockholder
resolutions in those corporations
which Grinnell College owns stock
and which operate in South Africa,
calling for: a) the corporations to
sign the Sullivan code; b) the cor-
porations to comply with the
Sullivan code; c) the corporations to
cease any activities which con-
tribute to upholding apartheid.

2) The board include a student as a
voting member of the trustees' in-
vestment responsibility committee.

Maytag responded by saying. “The
board will discuss this at their meeting in
the fall, although it’s not likely that it will
pass." Trustee Gardiner Dutton then inter-
rupted Maytag and exclaimed, “Now,
Fritz, we ought to take this Seriously. It's
worthy oi discussion." The group was then
instructed to type up a copy oi the com-
promise proposal and deliver copies oi it to
the trustees on Saturday morning. This
ended the meeting. at approximately 7:20

.m

On Saturday, the trustees brieily
discussed the proposal and stated that they
were “in general agreement" with it A
committee at the board will work over the
summer to put into speciiics a resolution
and the board will take action on it at their
iall meeting scheduled for Nov. 5 and o

SPLAG
champions
liberal arts

by Anne Bordonaro

Yet another acronym has been added to
the campus lingo: SPLAG. it you haven’t
heard yet, these initials stand tor the name
oi a new student group, “Students tor the
Preservation oi Liberal Arts at Grinnell,"
“The group intends to be a watchdog on
curent campus issues and a source or in-
formation," according to SPLAG member
Adam Burck

SPLAG ctr-founder Jeff Hersh explained
that the idea of the group began beiore
break when he and two fellow hall
presidents, Tony Kulick and Mark Brads
shaw, were upset about many campus
issues including the denial of tenure to
Assistant Professor oi Philosophy Dan
Magurshak, the decision to have no buffer
days for the next five semesters and the
possibility of the installation of a core curs
riculum. Hersh. Kulick and Bradshaw
were hoping to organize student action
through the SGA Joint Board but the board
was hesitant.

Hersh explained, “We want to get on it
right away We wanted to get the non-
activist student body aware oi what was
happening and establish some lines oi
communication with the iaculty and ad
ministration. We couldn't do it through
SGA so we decided to go outside SGA,"

The first SPLAG meeting was held on
April 22. Approximately 25 students at-
tended the first meeting and 35 attended
the second Hersh said, “The group took
off with a life of its own after the first
meeting," SPLAG members John Voltz
and Joel Robbinsorganized the ads
ministrative iorum. According to Hersh,
the goals of the group are to keep students
aware of what is happening as it happens
and not alter a decision has been made.
SPLAG committees are now working on
setting up a policy concerning computer
privacy and a job description which in-
cludes a description oi tenure policy.

Another SPLAG committee is working
with the faculty to arrange faculty-student
coffeehouses in order to keep informal
communications open. Hersh said that cer-
tain faculty members have hinted that
students ought to stop complaining about
decisions that have already been made
and work to see that these things don't
reoccur, In addition, Hersh cited that, "In
the past, students have not discussed cams
pus or national issues much with the faculc
ty.”

SPLAG members said they will continue
to hold iorums next year when necessary
as well as to keep watch on the administra
tion through the various administrative
committees, They intend to keep students
aware through 5&3 editorials and perhaps
even a newsletter

Hersh noted, “We can't change the declr
sions that have been made. We have to
concentrate on the iuture. You must be
emotional to get people aware and involve
ed and now we can be rational once people
are aware. As Magurshak said, ‘You have
to know what you want.’ It's time to tone
down one tension and iigure out what we
