Gas supply keeps pace

by Doug Schultz

Due to a number of favorable
circumstances, Grinnell's short
term energy situation appears
considerably brighter than one
year ago,

However, the broader picture or
long range planning to reduce
energy consumption has not
changed at all since a year ago this
month.

Director of the Physical Plant
Dale Hawn said the college heating
system has been operating on more
natural gas than oil this year. The
cost of producing the same amount
of steam with gas is about half that
of oil.

HOWEVER, DEAN Waldo
Walker said in terms oi cost, the
school is running about even with
last year, due to the excessively
cold weather. Last year, the
college Spent $178,000 on heating
fuel; fuel costs for this year are
budgeted for $185,000.

Last year, Hawn said, when
Grinnell's' gas supply was cut off in
November. 55 to 60 per cent of all
fuel consumed was oil. Hawn is
keeping his fingers crossed that the
majority of fuel used by the college
will be gas this year.

IIAWN SAID the main reason for
the difference was that due to labor
disputes various local industries
have slowed production, Normally
heavy users oi gas, those in
dustries have been using less, so
Grinnell, an “interruptible
customer" or low priority user, has
been receiving more.

Whether in oil or gas, the college
should have adequate fuel supplies
to meet energy needs for the rest of
the season, Hawn said, barring any
sudden increases in the number of
temperature degree days i a factor
relating temperature and number
of days).

THE COLLEGE, however. has
received no longsterm com-
mitments from either all or gas
suppliers. Fuel suppliers haven’t
guaranteed anything past Jan. 1,
Hawn said, The gas company won't
tell him from one day to the next
how much gas he has, but simply
tells him when to stop using gas
and when he can start.

Energy suppliers' caution is due
in part, Hawn feels, to the lack oia
national energy policy.

But the companies have been
very cooperative in guesstimating
usage needs and costs and have
assured him of adequate supplies
to meet college needs, he said.

THE COLLEGE receives its gas
irom NorthemNatural Gas Co. and
its oil from the Standard Oil, while
its electricity comes from Iowa
Power and Light.

Various conservation methods
implemented alter the oil embargo
oi 1972 continue to minimize or
reduce energy consumption in
:the short term.

Through “quick-fix” methods
alone, such as reducing tem
peratures in certain buildings and
curtailing air conditioning, con-
sumption of fossil fuel has been
reduced by 24 to 30 per cent since
Grinnell’s peak year of 1970-71.

NOT MUCH more can be done.
Hawn said, without large capital
investments or changes in the
academic program and cor
vironment. Such changes might

possibly involve rearranging the
academic schedule to coincide
more favorably with warmer
periods and daylight hours, for
example So iar, the college has
avoided taking such measures.

The only major conservation
project currently in progress is
dorm renovation, which includes a
tightening up of the building en-
velopes, installation of new win-
dows and foam insulation, and
upgrading of heating systems.

A COMMITTEE to consider
long-range alternatives and to
educate the community on energy-
conserving methods was
established over two years ago.
One year ago, Feb. 4. 1977, the

Work has been hampered by lack of
a Vice-Provost. the designated
chairman, Since William Barrett
resigned last semester.

Walker said, ”I don't think the
committee has been meeting very
much It doesn't surprise me with
the circumstances. . .Barrett was
to be our energy czar and then he
resigned.”

“For all practical purposes the
committee _ is dead,” SGA
President Jon Neiderbach com-
mented.

HAWN SAID the committee had
been in the process oi trying to
come up with an agenda or list of
energy alternatives open to the
community.

This year, the committee’s work

has been hampered by the lack

of a Vice-Provost, who was

supposed to he

the college’s

“energy czar, ” according to Dean

Waldo Walker.

5&3 reported that the committee
had done Virtually nothing in this
regard, having met only once.

The committee has not met at all
this year.

The committee’s work Was
halted last year to obtain data
measurements on energy use in
various buildings. $10,000 worth of
metering instruments were pur
chased for the purpose. Some of
them have been permanently in-
stalled in the Science building.
Hawn does not know whether the
others have yet been installed or
not, but if not, “they will be in the
near future."

Tllls YEAR. Hawn and Dean
Walker explain, the committee’s

Wouldsbe student member Keith
Harmon expressed his
dissatisfaction with the committee.
“Some data should have been
collected on air-conditioning by
now . . . since no report has been
made to the committee, i suspect
nothing is being done . . . Other
things could be done in the
meantime . . . some long range
things . . . Last spring the com-
mittee had talked about an energy
symposium for this fall, but it
wasn’t iollowed up," Harmon
continued. Harmon said no one
irom the committee has contacted
him.

“i feel a little left out in the
cold," he said.
