The “Constitution” of Today—Electrically Propelled

battleship of any nation to be electri-
cally propelled, is one of the most important
achievements of the Sclehtzﬁc age.

with electrical control, has greater ﬂexibility

of maneuver, which is a
distinct navel advantage,
but also gives greater econ-

normal cruising speed, she
will steam on less fuel than
the best turbine-driven ship
that preceded her.

The electric generating
plant, totaling 28,000 horse-

power, and the propulsion equipment of the
great superdreadnaught were built by the
General Electric Company. Their operation
has demonstrated the superiority of electric
propulsion over old-time methods and a
wider application of this prin

erators of 400. horsepower each, supply
