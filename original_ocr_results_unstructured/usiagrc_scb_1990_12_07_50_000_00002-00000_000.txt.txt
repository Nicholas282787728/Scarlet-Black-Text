"l'wo of three (candidates) are
relatively new to the game," said
Jepscn. The applicant pool was
biased towards a heavier back

ground in academic, rather titan
administrative, experience. J epscn

were“extremelyimpressivepeople

fective interviews."

committee searched for candidates
that, though lacking administrative
experience, could easily learn the

All of the candidates have ex-

Some faculty members at the
announcement were apparently
concernedthatthecandidatesmight
place too high an emphasis on pub»
lishing. Janet Sciz, assistant pro-
fessorineconomics,askedwhether
the finalisu understood Gnnnell‘s
concern with teaching more than
research. Jepsen answered that
during the interview, each of the
finalists gave the impression that
“as an undergraduate liberal arLs
institution," teaching is Grinnell’s
priority. However. Bob Grey, pro~
lesser of political science, pomled
out that Swanhmorc is “tilted" to-

wards research.

Thom Main, a student who at»
lendw the announcement. asket
whether any of the candidates rep»
resented minority groups. Jepse
answered that all three are white
and cited the lack of a minority
finalist as “unfortunate."

Another concern of the faculty
was that the candidates might par-
ticipate in onrcampus interview‘
and then turn down the college i
they are offered the job. Jepse
said that Bob Burnett. chair of the
committee, extended the invitation
on the assumption that the candi-
date would accept lhe offer if ih
job offer were extended, stating, “I
would beextremely surprised it the
president were not one of these
three."

SPARC Makes Up Lost Time

By Craig Wacker

To discuss topics vital to the
Grinnell media, the Student Publi~
cations and Radio Committee
(SPARC) met several times during
the weekend of Nov. 30. Topics
suchas next semester’s modiahud-
gets and hiring of new staffs were
covered by SPARC. SPARC'S
current head. Chris Gnnst, an-
nounced his resignation. It will
take effect at the beginning of the
spring semester.

According io SPARC member
Tamara Havelanr, the committee
”just got together and got it done. "
Havelaar stressed that the commit
toe had fullfilled its duties in terms
of budgets and hiring next
semester’s media heads. Also dis
cussed, she added, were prizes for
people who showed special in-
volvement in either KDIC or the
Scarlet and Black.

John Fuson, also 8 SPARC
member, had a similar assessment
of SPARC’S success this week He

added that SPARC decided upon a
criteria for distributing possible
prize money. The format, said
Fuson, would be to reward people
who had made a stron-
committment to either the SandB
Dl’ KDIC and were not members of
the paid staff. SPARC'S reason for
this exclusion, said Fuson. was to
try to ignite some interest in doing
good work for either the SandB or
KDIC outside of the immediate
staffs of these operations.

Havelaar said that she would be
glad to take over the position of
SPARC head if she were voted in
She stated thatshe would be “more
than willing"tobecometthPARC
head at the beginning of the spring
semester.

Gunst, though he has resigned

He is uncertain whether he will
continue it next semester. He den
clined to comment further on his
decision to give up his position.
