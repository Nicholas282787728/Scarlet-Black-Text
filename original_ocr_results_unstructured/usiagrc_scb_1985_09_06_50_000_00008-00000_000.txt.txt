Team is swinging aivay as they prepare
ior their. season opener at home, This
Saturday. the Pioneers will take on Grand-
view starting at 10 AM, at the Tenth
Avenue Courts,

The team should be a strong one this
year, havmg lost only three seniors to
graduation. Last year‘s team compiled a

record of 5 - 7 in dual meets, and a 5th ‘

place iinish in the conterence meet.

The team does return eight players ii-om
last year, including sophomore Maren Van
Nostrand. who is this year's team captain.
Also returning are Sophomores Laurie
Dunlvant. Brenda l-lilli Jean Hornyak.
Junior Susan Simon. and Seniors Liboy
Rohovit. Kate Eisenberg, and Carolyn
Carpenter.

Coach Gar Smith ieels that because this
year's team is larger than last year's

tthere are a total oi 17 women this
yeart, there should be a larger nucleus or

solid players around which to build. Coach
Smith also [eels that the six freshmen who
are on the team looking strong and
should be able to contribute some solid
periormance in both singles and doubles,

At this point, the team has not begun lad-
der play to determine the six singles and
three doubles positions, according to
Smith, However, within the coming weeks
they will be determined.

As (or the rest of the season, Smith feels
that the team’s Strongest competition
should come from Cornell and Coe, within
our own division. and overall, in the con-
lerence, lrom Chicago and Lake Forest
Coach Smith said that he is pleased with
the effort and attitude that the women
have shown in practice. They have been
practicing since New Student Days, and
Smith ieels that the practice will pay oii
during the season.
