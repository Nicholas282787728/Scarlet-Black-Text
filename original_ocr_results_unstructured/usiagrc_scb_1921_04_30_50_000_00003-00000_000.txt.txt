dorni season “as credited to Pitcher

Luildiug Tlircc ycstcrday arternoon,
when the Three»itcs downed llle boy
ironi [our in a good game S»0. Ale
though completely outclassed, the
foul ‘tes did wcli considering that
they were unable to get a hit and did
not succeed in knocking the ball out—
side of the infield. ‘

Smith and Clark ii‘iil

Smith hall and‘Clarlt hall both want
their games in the ﬁrst clahes of tiic‘
series, the Smith hall men beating
their Langan hall opponents s to 1,
by means of timely hits when bunch
ed hits were needed. Clark hail heat
the Six-ites zo- to 9 in the only rout
of the series, the northerner-s being
unable’to cope with the artistly of
their neighbors.

Datesnian, pitching for the Smith
hail men was wild but efiective in
his delivery and held the Langan men
to it few scattered hits, Potter, pitch—
ing for LangiLn, was hit rather freely
after the third inning, anti could not
hold the snilurites down. The Smith
rally started in the third, when a
shower of hits but the men [rom One
in the lead. Datesman was in pinches
several times after that, but always
successful in working himself out of
them. Both he and Potter had a good.
ly number oi strikeouts to their-
credit. The fielding was good on
both tennis, considering the condition
of the new field.

Show Great him-est

A great deal or interest has been
aroused m'er the series, and the games
have been well attended. Littie done
is being offered as to the probable
league leaders, because even the first
games brought forth a number of sur—
prises. The building Three inen have
a good team, and should prove hard to
heat, but the Clark hall victory over
Six makes them an outfit worth fig.
uring on for some competition. Lan-
gan and Smith halls both ought to
improve, and the story may change
before the next game is played,

All games are scheduled tor the
first three days of the week. Games
not played because of weather con-
ditions will be postponed to the lat—
ter part of the week. Every building
will meet every other building

The next games are scheduled for
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of
next week.

What Makes the Fireﬂy Glow‘?

0U can hold a ﬁreﬂy in your hand; you can boil
watéi with an electric lamp. Nature long ago evolved
the “cold light.” The ﬁreﬂy, according to Ives and

Coblentz, radiates ninety-six percent light and only four
percent heat. Man’s best lamp radiates more than ninety
percent heat. '

An English physicist once said that if we knew the ﬁr
fly’s secret, a boy turning a crank could light up a whole
street. Great as is the advance in lighting that has been
made through research within the last twenty years, man
wastes far too much energy in obtaining light.

This problem of the “cold light” cannot be solved merely

by trying to improve existing power-generating machinery
and existing lamps. We should still be burning candles if
chemists and physicists had conﬁned their researches to the
improvement of materials and methods for making candles.

For these reasons, the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company are not limited in the scope of
their investigations. Research consists in framing questions
of the right kind and in ﬁnding the answers, no matter

- where they may lead. l

What makes the ﬁreﬂy glow? How does a ﬁreﬂy’s light
differ in color from that of an electric arc, and why? The
answers to such questions may or may not be (if-practical
value, but of this we may be sure-it is by dovetailing the
results of ”theoretical” investigations along many widely
separated lines that we arrive at most of our modern
“practical” discoveries.

What will be the light of the future? Will it be like that
of the ﬁreﬂy or like that of the dial on a luminous watch?
Will it be produced in a lamp at present undreamccl of, or
will it come from something resembling our present incan-
descent lamp? The answers to these questions will depend
much more upon the results of research in pure science than

upon strictly commercial research.
