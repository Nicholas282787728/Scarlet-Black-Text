from Mr, Egloff and Mr. Ramsay the
editorship and business managershin
of the Scarlet and Black, cannot, but
look backward over the last year of
accomplishments at the Scarlet and
Black, and then look forward as train
the foot or the ladder, to see what lies
in store for us in the coming year.

We see behind us a year marked by
the return of the Gl‘ihnell Spirit in all
its force and strength, to the position
of leadership which it has always held.

for peacetime comforts, gave the old
