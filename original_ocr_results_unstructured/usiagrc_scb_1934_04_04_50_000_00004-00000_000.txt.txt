HEREVER the ﬁnest tobaccos grow—

in our own Southland, in Turkey, in
Greece—all over the World, we gather the very
Cream of the tobacco Crops for Lucky Strike.
And that means only f/IL’ t‘llllt’r lmwr. Not the
top leaves—because those are under-developed
—not ripe. Not the bottom leaves—because
those are inferior in quality—they grow close
to the ground, are coarse, dirt-covered, sandy.

The center leaves are the mildest leaves—they
taste: better rind farmers are paid higher prices
for them. These center leaves are the only ones
used in making Luckies. Then “It's toasted”
—~for throat protection. And every Lucky is
fully packed with these choice tobaccos—
made round and ﬁrm, free from loose ends—
thut’s why Luckies do not dry out. Naturally,
Luckies are {Ill-M kind to your throat.
