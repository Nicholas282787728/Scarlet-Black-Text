Plagiarism Rules Vs Reason

The rules cone ling plag il’ in are among the mo 't
serious in consequence; yet they are the Vailuest in de
nilion alld are understood by few ii any students.

k Hnbm, Mi

 

According to our obsei tiens, Gi'innell has failed to1
ma ie any attenlpt to eliminate these shortcomings 111 tlle
plagiarism code and the enforcement of that code.

Rules on 'plag'iarislll should be made available to every
studen' These rules should be explained to ally student
uncertain of their meaning:

But before the rules can be explained and understood,
they inilst exist in a carefully defined code. Only after
tlle rules have been defined and explained, can it be stat»
ed that the full responsibility lies with the students.

Furthermore. those making the charges should have

some form of defined proof. It is unfair and unreasonable,

to question a student’s honesty, thereby subiecting him to
nllmberous hearings, cross-examinations and personal hu—
miliation, unless this real pioof is available. A professor
may question a student's honesty, bill: only when some
form of proof is available should the case be dragged
through all the various channels until it finally reaches
the Committee on Academic Standing

Dorm Policy Can Be Expanded

Students have been asked to e\press theii opinions on
the open doim system.

We see no reason why the system should not be con-
tinued. To our knowledge, there have been no reported
0 s of improper behavior. Tile system has not interfered
\\ t|1 those who study in the dorms. Although the group
of 'tudcnts using1 the system is small, it is, we are sure,
appreciative

Ii", iii any way, the system is limited, it will be a step
backward for Grinnell.

Oil the cont 1ry, considerinrr the success of the pres-
ent program, set 0115 consideration should be given to e. -
pansion of the privileges.

Saturday night open dorms would allow small infor-
mal parties. Since Saturday nights, unlike Sunday after-
noons, are not study periods, more students would take
advantage of the open dorms.

Such a system would be a great boon to the social
situation. Student discussion and advocacy—both formal
alld informaliarc needed to take the next step.
