GRINNELL-IN-GRINNELL.

Charity begins at home. Are we to he a charity case?

Grinnell has proudly maintained a branch 01 herself
in China for some years. No one Wishes to belittle the
work she has done. DouhLless the Chinese themselves
would he the last to say anything against such an organi~
zation, Yet, with the present state of affairs, china
might like a short rest from foreign institutions. it is a.
good time for Grinnell to take stock of herself and make
a more equal division 0! her funds.

The claim has been made that more students would
give to the Pioneer Chest it they knew that Grinnell helu
self was not going to suffer in order that Grinnell-in-
China might exist. The present situation of the band
calls for this l'edivisioh of finances more strongly than
any plea. the student might make. We are remiss in
spending our money on foreign missions. But we have no
objection to helping out home missions The only other
solution for keeping the band, that of making it in indEr
pendent organization has been suggested. otherwise, the
Pioneer Chest must be more evenly divided. GrinnelHn»
China. may suffer a little, but it can not with justice he
supported at the expense or Grinnell-in-Grinnell.

A OLE-AA -UP UAMIPAIGN.

\‘Vhile we are objecting to the excessive amount of
smoking done on this campus, we might also put in a
bad word for the brick Vialk and the back )ard.

[lat and smooth, a pleasure to walk on it. Let it have bal-
ance and s nnlcl no cracks and bumps to catch an une
w , heel. It has hill its uses: it has pitched many a
lair maid into the welcoming arms ol‘ her escait But it
does not niior \ . it touch lor the unoscortcd. it is not
a ltl‘l’l cl down; it is n brick walk. and as such should do
its duty. Let us have a brick wall: that it a help, not a
hindrance. Let it be “a thing of beauty" and “a joy to
ever.”

And the back that part of the campus which sur-
rounds thc power house. A visitor remarkcd that we had
a nice campus, but it looked a little ragged in spots.
“Don't you have rakes? Don't you have waste—bal-relsi

oh, no, not even though our bl'ick»\\'nlk trips us daily,
our back 'ﬂ.l'(l looks like ii section 01 a city dump, and
our slnoke slack smokes.

in an institution ot this sort where the problem of
co—cducctlon has been settled sctlstactorily on the sur»
face at least, We are now and then startled by the chance
comments of visitors into realizing tha odeducaion is
still a problem and will be one tor some time to come.
Usually we think or the problem as being primariy a. so-
cial one. It has its social aspects; these aspects clone
have been setlcd here to a certain extent, The real prob-
lem, that or education, is still under debate.

Education lrom the first has been formulated roi-
the male. The subjects it offers, the standards it sets are
fitted to masculine qualifications and tastes. lrito this
world of tlle intellect has come the feminine element. it
is a disturbing fnl'lze, and, since it can not now be elimi—
nated. it. calls for serious consideration.

Onc solution is, obviously. the school that is tor men
or women only. It is hardly a solution. it rather evades
the issue. For the women’s colleges still base their edu-
cational system on tllitt round in the men's colleges. Wo-
men still meet the same tests, take the same courses. It
is not fair to them, They are euuipped by nature with
ditferent faculties and abilities fur llle. It is equivalent
to matching a lightweight with a heavyweight in a. box-
ing match and expecting them to do equally well. No,
the Women’ college does not solve the problem.

Nor is it fair to the man. He is asked to compete
with persons who are not his natural equals, nor can they
be. Their powers or endurance are not equal: they have
been trained by tradition and environment into different
lines. in the boxing match, the heavy weight was as bane
dicapped as the other, though it might seem to the cone
tml'y. Good sportsmanship demands that he does not
play up to the best in him. He must lower his standards in
order to give the other fellow a square chance. In vying
with women in class and exam. the man is really handi-
capped as much as the woman is.

Then the solution seems to be a new course of edu-
cational work. In this new course, the woman may do
the sort of work she desires and enjoys. and she may
gain her independence. She will pass only such tests
and measure to such standards as are justly expected of

her. Yet this leaves another qllestion——wb at or those
fields uhich are open to both men and women? There

some set of values some measure must be round which
is fair to both sexes, Double standards are no longer
possible.
