Newton brewery offers free beer this Saturday from 12-6

By]. FRANCIS Bust:

Mason Groben stepped out of the old Maytag factory
onto the gravel road in yellow galoshes, dusty jeans and a
plain gray t-shlrr.Waliting our ofthe brick building, which
produced millions of appliances from the early 20th cen-
tury until a few years ago, Groben looks as if he could be
coming off a shift making your grandparcnrs' new dryer.
But no, Gtoben was ending a day or making, drinking
and thinking about beer—all a part of his job running the
monthrold Madhouse Brewery.

“There used to be washers and dryers that ran around
the block in here.” croben said, referring to the spacious,
concrete warehouse which houses all the equipment neces
sary to brew and was formerly used as a testing facility for
appliances.

Groben has a long history or making alcohol. Along
with his job of running Madhouse, he also serves as a
winemaker for his family’s company, Jasper Wineries,
which recently moved from Newton to Des Moines.

After the move, Groben and the CEO of Iowa Teler
com, Allen Wells, decided to open a brewery in the old
factory space IownTelecorn had purchased the entirety of
the old Maytag property and had unused square footage.

“I started talking to the folks at IowaTclccom and they
actually independently liad‘the rdea or starring a brewery,
because they have all rhe space leftover when they took
over from Maytag," Graben said.

After a few legal hurdles, including working towards
repealing a prohibitionsera Iowa law that prevented him
from working for both a winery and brewery, Groben set

up shop in the Maytag factory this March.

Groben, who runs the brewery as a oneernan operation,
has spent the last months setting up shop and beginning
his first batches of been As of now, Madhouse Brewery
consists of two beers—an American style wheat beer, aptly
named American Wheat, and a American Pale Ale, named
Pastime, a nod to the first model of Maytag washing ma—
chines.

“We will eventually add on to more, we want to get
these two brands launched first. Maybe like an Amber Ale,
or a double IPA,”Groben said,

While he knows beers better than your average Pat, Groe
ben said this was his first foray into brewing them. Groben,
who attended the UniversityofCalifornia-Davis and earned
a degree in winernnking and has worked at several winer-
ies, hopes to translate that experience into beer-making,

“Ijilst kind orjusr gor into beet—mukingjusl a couple of
months ago when I started learning how to use the equlp’
ment," Groben said. “But a lot ofthe chemistry is the same.
a lot ofihe processing and fermentation are the same and a
lot of things rire different. But I think I'll be able to figure
it out,"

Judging from the taste of his boots, he’s not far off.
American Wheat received generally positive views from
the staffofthe SEE, and does more or less what is expected
from its style—refreshes without demanding too much air
tention.The Pastime Pale Ale, which is being bottled this
weekend for distribution and was only available onrsite to
this reporter straight from the fermentation tank, pours a
nice amber color and has a rich caramelly ﬂavor with a sat»

isfyingly subtle citrus taste and plenty of hops.

Gtoben has begun distribution ofhis beer in Poweshiek
County. including McNally’s,

“Just last week, I hired a sales guy and bought a van,”
Groben said “The first batch sold out at McNally's in a
week. starring next week, we shouldn't run out again."

Groben may not be producing world-class brews yet,
but he seems committed to making Madhouse Brewery a
point of pride in the region, which was economically hit
hard in past years.

When it was announced the Maytag plants would close
in 2007, the New York Times ran an article looking into
the dire economic and social consequences rhe loss of a
100*yearrold institution would have on the town. “Directly
or indirectly, everything that has happened here has de—
pended on Maytag," Newron resident and former Maytag
employee Leland Smith said, as quoted in the article.

In 2007, 1,800 jobs were lost when the factory closed
its doors. For a town of 16,000, it seemed it would be a
crippling blow, its future still remains largely up in the air,
especially after large Job losses were posted for the county
between January and February

Groben will be opening his doors ro the public on April
17 for an open hou. “We have our grand opening on Sate
iirday," Groben said. ‘Free beer, from noon to six. No, serif
ously, tree beer."

Madhouse Brewery can be found at 403 W, 4th Str Nr,
only about 20 minutes by car from Grinnell. But seriously,
free beer from noon to six,
