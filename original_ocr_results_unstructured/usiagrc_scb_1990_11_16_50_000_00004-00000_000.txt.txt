Does TM Really
Work For All?

Grinncll Club Says ”Certainly"

By Helene Eisenman

The Transcendental Meditation
Club is one ofthe newestgroups on
Grinnell's campus. The group has
been meeting regularly to practice
transcendental meditation only
since Sept. l9. The formation of
the TM Club has produced a grow-
ing interest on campus in the prac»
tice. Approximately 10 members
participate in the TM sessions on a
regular basis.

Transcendental Meditation is a
simple mental technique which in-
duces relaxation and relieves stress.
It is generally p'erformed twice
daily, for 20 minutes at a time, by
sitting with eyes closed while re-
peating a mantra.

The practice comes from an an-
cient uadition. Up until the late
1950’s, TM was mainly performed
in the Himalayas by a secluded and
small group of people. However,
TM has since been introduced to
the west by the Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi and has attracted a growing
number of people.

Various studieshave pmven TM
to be one of the most effective
methods of stress reduction. People
who practice TM generally are
healthier, more creative and alert
and more relaxed after pmeticing
for a signiﬁcant time period.

It also has been shown that for
people who practice TM, the bio-
logical aging process is slowed
down, and there is less ofa need for
medical care. A study of Vietnam
veterans compared TM to psycho
therapy in reducing alcohol prob
lems, emotional numbness, insome
nia, anxiety: family problems and

depression. For those practicing
TM, the results were better than
those being treated with psycho-
therapy.

The TM Club meets daily to
meditate together. Other than that,
their only other activity is bringing
speakers to Grinnell to talk about
TM. The TM Club was formed by
Todd Smith, who has been per-
forming 'l‘M since the age of six,
when he was introduced to it by his
parents.

A recent lecture sponsored by
tthM Club wasentitled“Crealing
World Peace Through Group Prie-
tioe of Transcendental Meditation ."
During this lecture, the proposed
"Global Maharishi Effccl" was
discussed. According to the
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a suffi»
ciently large group of people
meditating simultaneously can have
a positive effect on the world.

The numbcrof people shouldbe
at least equal to the square root of
one percent of the world‘s popula~
tien,about7,000 people. Since the
underlying cause of war and vio-
lence is stress in society, the
Maharishi’sptoposalstatesuiatwar
and violence can be eliminated by
reducing stress in society through
TM.

In an attempt to prove this theory,
7,000people from all overthe world
gathered in Fairl’lcld, IA at the
Maharishi Intemationnl University
from Dec. 1983 through Jan, 1984
to practice group TM. Some of the
effects observed from this session
were decreased international con-
flicts, reduced casualties in Leba-
non and decreased incidence of in-
fectious disease in the US. during
that time period.

Oneofthe goalsoftthM Club
at Grinnell is to do a similar test
here. They would like to see the
effect of the square root of one
percent of the campus population
practicing group TM on the com
munity. The group would investi-
gatesuch its effecton sucharcas as,
the number of people who visit the
Health Center and the number of
people suffering from common
ailmcms Such as colds.

Health Committee Increases
Awareness of Major Problem

By Tom Gregg

In order to educate the campus
community about alcohol, the
Grinnell College Committee on
Student Health sponsored the an
nual Alcohol Awareness Week
Nov. 12-l6.

The purpose of the awareness
campaign is to educate the campus
community about use and abuse of
alcoholandaboutthewaysinwhich
alcohol consumption affects every-
day life.

“Alcohol is a significant coinc-
tor in virtually every type of injury
or sex—related harm which occurs
on campus” according to a 1989
study released by Northem Illinois
University about undergraduate
students.

The Committee sponsored sev—
eral events during the week. Pro-
teus, the improvisational comedy
group, played comic scenes about
alcohol in Cowles and Quad dining
halls. Dean ofStudents Tom Crady

spoke about adult children of alco-
holics, HACs showed movies that
included themes of alcohol aware
ness, and KDIC played public ser-
viceannouncementsaboutAIcohol
Awareness Week.

“We aren't [necessarily] trying
togetpcepletostopdrinking.. we
just want to help people think a
littleaboutalcoholandwhatitdoes,
(especially) the effects alcohol can
have on your actions [and thus] on
your long-term future," explains
Amy Aldous, Younker Hall RA
and coordinatorof Alcohol Aware-
ness Week.

According to Aldous, the most
common misperccption about al»
coholatGrinnellCollegeistheidea
that "everyone“ drinks, and that a
person must drink in order to so-
cialize. In her experience, shcsays,
that is much less true at Grinnell
than it traditionally is on larger
campuses.

Aldoussaldthatwl'tileshcditin’l
think there were a great deal of

alcohol-related problems on carn-
pus. many students don't think
enough about the effects of alcohol
use on their individual lives, and
Alcohol Awareness Week will help.

The Week has been an annual
event for several years, and it pree
ceded the new campusalcohol/drug
policy. It was formerly under the
supervision of H/GRC Advisory
Board.

Its new coordinators wish to
focus on what Aldous terms “pas-
sive programming." This passive
strategy aims at informing a broad
spectrum of students who may not
take theinitiative to attenda lecture
about alcohol, but who still need to _
understand the issues.

Othcrevents that the Committee
on Student Health is spearheading
include the Great American
Smokeoul and the Dec. l5 lecture
by Danny Sugarman, who is recov-
ering from substance abuse and is a
former member of the rock group
The Doors.
