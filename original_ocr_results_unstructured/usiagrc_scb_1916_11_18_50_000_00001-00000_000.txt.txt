The annual Homecoming celebration
tor the alumni of Gl'inneil College
will begin next Thursday evening and
will continue through' Sunday, closing
with a special Vesper service Sunday
otter-noon. Friday is an official holir
day for the college and will be the
biggest day of the three1 with the dedi-
cation ceremonies for Alumni Hall.
the Cornelmrinnell football game,
and the Itinnesnta-Grinncll soccer
game as features of the day's events.

To Play Minnesotll.

Athletic Director Hulf completed ne-
gouations for the MinnesolarGrinuell
soccer game early yesterday after-noon
and the contest will he played on Fri-
day morning, beginning probably at
15:30. When Iowa called off its game
with Crinnell early this week it was
feared that thc program of events
would be marred by the absence of a
iioccer contest, but the assurance of a
game with Minnesota removed these
fears, and now the new game offers
a bigger attraction than the Iowa mix
would have been.

Play For Championship.

Probably the biggest feature of the
program is the Cornell-Crinnell toot-
ball game, which is scheduled for . i
Friday afternoon. in addition to being
a championship match this, year from
the Gllnnell standpoint, the annual
battle with Cornell always furnishes
as much interest to both Gl'inl'lell slur
dents and alumni as any other game
of the schedule. Plans are being ln'itde
by Gl'illnell merchants to secure a.
large attendance at the game, and it is
probable that the town band will as~
sist the College organization in rm»
nicning music.

T. o. Douglass of Grinnell, for the
trustees, Miss Milleid for the College
faculty, J. G. Sivan of Minneapolis, for
the alumni, and Earl Gould, who will
speak on behalf of the students. At
first it was planned to hold the cel'er
monies in the assembly hall of the
new building, but delay in the work
has prevented the hall's being ready
by Friday.

to Dinner To Cornell Team.

A big football dinner will be given
in the Quadrangle dining room at six

‘NEW DDRMS NOT A

Declares, Instead, That Purpose oi the

Best Life Possible—Explhllls ,
New Group Will Cont n

“That the new Men’s Quadrangle
will be a sort of glorified prison pre-
sided ovci- by a sixteenth century
pricst, seems to he the prevailing idea
of many people around Gl'lnnell,” de-
clared Dean E. J. Jaclua in a chapel
“Such, how-
ever, is far from the case. The pur-
posc o[ the new group is to provide a
simple, wholesome, and economical
life for the men under conditions that
will develop a community sp it and
thc l)CSt_ t'eatures of a dis nct men's
college.”

Sixteen Buildings in All.

The ph.ca1 aspects of the new
dormitories were first discussed by
the speaker. He sttid that the come
pleted group will include sixteen builds
lugs arranged ill three quadranglcs
and connected by open cluisters, A
Men's Union, \vlth reading rooms,
game rooms. a dining hall and guest
room, and a new men's gymnasium
are also included in the plans. Tire
completed system will provide homes
for sou men, and will probably be fin»
ished within the next five or ten years.

“Additional cottages will be erected
only as demanded by the men," said
Mr. Jaqua. “There will be no attempt
to force any one to live in the dormi—
toi but the aim is to make the
buildings so atil'aeli\e that the men of
the college bill prefer to room there.”

Home For Gi'iltlllzllcs. Too.

The unit system, as explained by
Mr. ,laqna, will be used exclusively,
Not more than thirty men \l'ill‘lle in
most of the cottages, so that there will
he les distraction than would he the
case in a larger dormitory. Each
house can dcvclon its own distinctive
life and responsibility. yrs in to thc
college will be entertained as in a ll'zl—
tei-nity house,

"The dormitoi-ic- will be homes for
returning graduate , continued the
speaker. "The man who has llVCd in
one of the houses will feel that he has
a Grinnell hams to return to at Com-
mencement and on Homecoming days,"

Plan 100 lenr .llicinl.

“We are planning Gl'l'llllell's growth
not for the next iew years, but for
ten, fifty, and a hundred year~
chided Mr. Jadua. “When this dormi-
tory group is finished, Glinnell will
have the most completely appointed

group of men's hulldillgs in the coun-

"Are we a nation?" was the question
very inter 'Llngly discu. ed Friday or»
clung by Professor E. A, Steiner in an
address before the Congregational
church Brotherhood, The merit of the
address was all the greater consider-
ing the tact that Dr, Steiner delivered
it without time for preparation. F. A.

of the evening, was detained at the last
moment and could not he present, and

a score of 13 to 7. Over a hundred
students braved the Cold Weather to
see the two teams mix.

The linc-up for the Varsitythe first

carried the ball to the 1920 five yard

favor of the Freshmen.

In the second period the Freshmen
pulled off several end runs on the
slippery field, but were held when
they became dangerous. The second
team of the Varsity could not gain
consistently and Macy was often forc—
ed to punt. Even when the first
string mcn wcre put in against the

Three Games With Iowa,—
Glass Series Over.

Minnesota University will play’ Grim
hell in soccer next Friday forcnoon,
according to the announcement just
made by “Doc” Huff. Arrangements
were completed last night. The game
is to be played the morning of Home—
coming day—and will be one of the
features at the celebration,

Negotiations with Minnesota, who
had inquired earlier in the season
about getting a game with Grinnell.
were star-ted immediately when news
was received several days ago that
Iowa. was unable [a make up a team
because of lack of interest in the
game. The breaking off of soccer re-
laLions with the State University is
much regretted, but all soccer enthus-
iasts are greatly pleased that a con-
test will) Minnesota has been secured.

Millllcsoltt Is Strong.

Minnesota is known to have a
strong team and although the arm-
iicll squad is tor the most part coni-
posed of seniors who have played sev<
crsl seasons, it uill have to play in
top form to stand an evell‘ chance with‘
the fest univei- ty team.

Gl'illllell has played Iowa for three
years, and has won two out or threé
times. The first game, played three
years ago, was won by the scarlet and
black in easy fashion, 5-0. Last year,
Gi-iniicll sent a team to Iowa City and
brought home the bacon alter a hard
fight which‘en’ded 1 .

luwit Victory Wils Close.

The game which went to Iowa was
played two years ago on the morning 1
before the Cornell game, and ended in
a _ 1 score, Each team made one goal
and it Ioohcd as it a tie game would
result, but an over-anxious Gi-innelliau
reached up' and slapped the ball with
his hand and a free kick from close
up gale the Iowans the game.

an 5 point margin on the Indiana

This puts Gl'illllell and Illinois on cv-

Minnesota. But as Minnesota beat‘
Iowa 5770 and Iowa is 10 better than
Grinnell, we could beat Grinncll 81-0.
