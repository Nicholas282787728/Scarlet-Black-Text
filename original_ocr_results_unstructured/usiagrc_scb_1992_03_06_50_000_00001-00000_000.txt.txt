New system for faculty pay raises

By Chris Maag

Faculty will receive merit-based
‘pzty ratses of up to four percent next
,year as the administration and Board

of Directors work to maintain and

‘ attract high level professors. The boa

, nuses will be complimented by a five
percent salary incmse for the ma jor-

‘ ity of professors.

. The system which has been used
up to this year has given merit-based

' salary increases to an average of 15

. faculty, based primarily on scholarly
research and publication. The new

‘criterion for merit will be broader,

.and will include service in commitr
tees and student groups as well as

' scholarship.

. “Any amount a faculty member
gets over the standard ﬁve percent
willbe because of excellence tn teachr

A ing, coupled with time spent in com-

_munity service or, in some cases,
scholarship. What we’re doing is

'moving to a system where more

. people getmerit forawider variety of
activities,” said President Pamela

A Ferguson. “ltwillbebecauseof these

‘ merit considerations, market consid-

‘ stations, or both.”

the college compares the amount it
pays professors to the pay given to
professors atothcrcolleges, Thenew
salary system is designed to keep the
Grinnell faculty positions at the
equivalentpay level as other colleges
to ensure Grinnell can attract high-
caliber professors.

The new system for faculty pay
bonuses is also planned to help pror
fessors revise their courses to keep
pace with changes in their fields of
study by helping encourage their at-
tending of professional conferences,
working with national groups con~
nected to their field or helping to
write books and textbooks, as well as
scholarship work. The allocation of
the funds will be controlled by the
faculty budget committee, working
with Dean of Faculty Charles Duke.
and will take under considemllon rec-
ommendations by department heads
and reports written by the individual
faculty members.

“We firmly believe that faculty
scholarshipsupponsteaching.Schol-
arship isn‘tjust defined as number of
publications; it’s anything that helps
enhance the faculty’s role as teach-
ers," said Duke. "Almost everybody

good way to encourage scholarship.”
The money for the increased num-

berofmerit-based bonuses will come
primarily from the endowment and

from grants and donZlLlonS to the Cole
lege, which pay for about half of the
college’s budget. The other half, stur
dent tuition, will not be going to-
wards much of the increase given
next year‘s comparatively low six
percent hike in tuition and fees.

“Nine percent is extraordinarily
generous on the pan of the board in
this economy, particularly when you
realize that its combined with a low
increasein tuition-- the studentsaren't
paying for this,” said Ferguson.

Faculty support for the change has
been almost unanimous. At two gen-
emlstaffmeetings,oneduring the fall
and the most recent one Febniary 24,
there was a general consensus in sup-
portof the change to a broader defini-
tion of meriL.

“In general, I’m very pleased that
the college is willing to validate the
total picture of what it is to he an
academic," said Michael Bell, chair
ofthe American Studies Department,
“to reward people who are doing ev-
erything they’re expected to do, and

Market considerations are when I've talked to has agreed that this is a maybe a little more.“

Used music for sale

By Becky Martin

Music buffs will be able both to
buy and to sell used compact discs,
tapes and records at the SGA Music
Sale tomorrow. The sale, which will
last from 1 p.m.until4p.m.,willbein
Nonh Lounge.

Students planning to sell their
music need to deliver it to the SGA
ofﬁce in the Forum today. “We‘re
asking people to drop off the stuff
they want to sell by 5 p.m.,” ACE
coordinater Sarah Jepsen said.

SGAwillsuggestprices foritems,
based on prices found at used music
stores, but students are free to charge
as much or as little as they wish, As
with the SGA Book Sale, ten percent
of the money made will be kept by
SGA.

For each CD, tape or record left by
students, a form listing the price, the
album title, and the seller will be
sealed in the case. These forms will

be removed and kept asareeord of the
sale when people buy the recordings
on Sauirday.

Five people will be on duty as
security. Also,onlyone entrance and
one exit will be used, and backpacks
and books will need to be left at the
door. lepsen said,“We’re trying tobe
really Light on security."

SGA is notmakingany guarantees
about the quality of the items. Stu-
dents will be buying at their own
risks.

Unsold music will be stored in the
SGA ofﬁce in the Forum until Sun-
day afteroon between 1 and 5, at
which time sellers will be allowed to
collect it. Starting Monday, students
who made money should be able to
collect their proﬁts.

TheCD,tape, and record salecould
become a campus tradition. “If a lot
of people show up, I think it’s some-
thing that should keep going," said
lepsen.
