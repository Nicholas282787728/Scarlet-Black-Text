Ruby Keeler says:

“Luckies are a light smoke that treat a
tender throat right”

"In a way, it’s easier to keep in con»
dition as a dancer than as a singer. ,
Exercise ,can keep the muscles in
shape, but there are a lot of things
that can go wrong with the voice and
throat. It stands to reason, then, that
any actress wants a cigarette that is
gentle and strikes the right note with
her throat. I started smoking Luckies
4 years ago. They’re a light smoke
that treat a tender throat right.”

LOVELY WARNER BROS. STAR
NOW APPEARING IN
“READY, WILLING AND ABLE"

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who
said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated
they personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Keeler veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain

harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
"It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
