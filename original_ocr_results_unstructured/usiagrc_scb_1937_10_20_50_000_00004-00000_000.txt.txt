THE STUDENT AND HIS CONFERENCE—

Editor‘s Note: The following editorial
is the second in the group collcmlting tho
place of the individual student upon the
campus and his telutiolt to the various (is,
pacts of college life. It appears out of logi-
cal order in the, series because of its time-
linessl

* a at

Though delegates from over 100 col-
leges and high scllools throughout the mid-
west have, during the past few years, at-
tended each of the International Relations
conferences, the meetings have never been
proportionately welhattended by the student
body. .

The reason for such lack of attendance
can scarc’ely be due to the inefficiency of
the committee in getting out publicity or in
arranging a well—rounded and worthwhile
program. Nor can it be attributed to pr
fessors who do not support the conference
and make an effort to interest their class-
es.

The reason can only be the fault of the
apathetic student who finds it too great a
task to slip into his coat and walk one
block to the chapel.

We live iii an artificial world here on
the campus, surrounded as we so thorough—
ly are by classroom work. Such concelh
tration of interest makes an inefficient Citlr
zen of the college mall or woman,

The conference, however, offers a pr
gram of speeches by men and women from
all parts of the United States, well»travelled,
well-read on current problems. It lends to
this artificial campus world' an internation-
al, more cosmopolitan air which migh‘ well
be considered a saving hand for us :1”.

The conference funds are in part de-
rived from the semester fee allotment and
thus each student has a share in financing
the project. Is it then too nluch to echct
that each student would take a fulther,
more beneficial (both to himself and the
conference) part? '

Particularly to upperclassmen this
suggestion might be made. Recently a sul-
vey of teachers was taken to determine
their knowledge of world affairs. The re»
sults were appalling for only very few
knew as much as their pupils and certainly
not enough to help guide this younger group
toward saner international ideals.

The conference is designed to help you
become a better educated person. It stands
now at your door, completely paid for, ready
for use to your best advantage.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD.

—G—
THE VIEW OF THE ISOLATIONISTS

The editorial printed below from the
Wall Street Journal explains the view of the
isolationists, but there is another stand taks
ell on international affair, by many, and
that is co-operation.

There are those wllo believe that the
isolationist is economically and practically
unsound, because no permanent safety can

be achieved by hiding our heads in the
sand like the prove 'biol ostrich. These peo-
ple see in the United States a great con-
structive power, and they believe that, like
all individual, no nation can live to itself
alone. lll this complex world the fate of
tllc Ullitcd States is too bound up, economic-

~ ally, politically, and commercially with that

of other nations to warrant our indiffer-
ence to the affairs of the world,

Those who would have the United
States co-opcrute believe that a firm, defi-
nite stand, clearly expressed and “go 'ously
adhered to, would be a great restraining
power for those nations who have dreams
of imperialistlc grandeur. If these latter
nations were sure of a vigorous opposition
from the United States, it is highly im-
probable that such opposition would ever re-
sult in war The threat itself would be
sufficient, because it could and would be
bucked, and everyone would know it.

A. L. B.

The editorial: ‘

It begins to look as if events are shap-
ing so that Alllerica might conceivably drift
into the employment of armed force.

Whatever the excuse or explanation, we
believe it to be insufficient

We believe the American people are at
present firmly opposed to the sending of a
single American boy over any sea for any
purpose no matter how altruistically the
case may be presented

We believe that American capital ovcrr
whellningly opposes the earning of a single
dollar through the employment of American
armed forces anywhere ill the world

We don’t want to be dragged into the
League of Nations by the front door, the
back door or through 21 roof blasted off by
ally other nation’s bombs. '

Twenty years ago we fought one war to
“save democracy.” That war nearly extinr
guishcd civilization.

We don’t know what another war may
do to the remnants of civilization, but we
are sure America can best serve civilization
by remaining at peace.

That this is also the view of the Presi-
dent we have no doubt.

But the attainment of such a goal is
not furthered by meddling ill the business
of other llatiolls.

Give a thought to the plight of “op-
pressed” nations if we must. But give fol‘es
thought to the plight of Americans in
America who want peace and who can best
serve the world by remaining at peace.

Protect Americal—yes, to the
maul

But no such issue is at present involved.

Let us keep it from developing by
minding our own business NOW!

WHAT ABOUT GBINNELL MERCHANTS?

In Saturday’s issue of the Scarletand
Black appeared an advertisement pointing
out the reasons why the students should pa-
tronize Scarlet and Black advertisers In
the some issue appeared a story stating that
a committee was being sent to Des Moines

last

' to purchase furniture for the White house,

the new student rec eatioll center.

We have been asked why the college
organizations should not also cooperate with
the local merchants in building a better
college and town spirit. We have been told
that the dcsilo is to purchase second—hand
furniture which cannot be secured locally to
an amount sufficient to meet the demand.
However, we are still of the opinion that
nothing would be lost if local business men
were first given the opportunity to see if
they were in a position to satisfy the need.
Certainly such a practice would do mllch
to establishing better relations between the
college and the town
