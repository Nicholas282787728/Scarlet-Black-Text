Grinnell College studcnn could be

leave eompurr’ng pohey unchanged

Observers say ITS seems ro be push.
mg Fer rhe firsr plan. According ro rhe
reporr. whrch is available on lTS's websire,
rhe mandarory laprop program would
probably be paid for by an increase in
rhe eomprehensive fee.

Wore laprops simply universally r:»
qlllrcd, rhe college could olifer ﬁnancial
aid oprions ro defray rhe cosr for srudenrs

“In my mrnd," said Jonarhan
Emmons '02, “requiring rhe srudonrs ro

The proglam would likely crearc a
need for addirional ITS sraffro provide

sure how many people would need ro be

“I don’t rhink they mu get (in: staff,"
