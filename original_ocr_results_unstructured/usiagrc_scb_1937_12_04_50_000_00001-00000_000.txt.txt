AN EDITORIAL..—

The step taken by the faculty
committee on athletics in asking
that Grinnell be allowed to with-
draw from the Missouri Valley
conference will undoubtedly in-
voke the cry that by doing so
we have admitted our inferiority.

We believe that the action is
on the contrary a sensible ad-
mission that we have been play-
ing out of our class,

,That even this admission is
hard medicine to swallow is ob-
vious. Yet sane contemplation
brings the realization that it is
the wise thing to do.

The spirit and morale of the
school and the teams will be
improved by the more even com-
petition which will result in a
conference of schools comparable
to ours in size. This wholesome
effect will in our opinion more
than offset the depression effect

of dropping out of the Valley.

GRINNELL, IOWA SKTURDLW,

PETITIOII FOR WITHDRAWAL
FROM MISSOURI IIALLEY

1 am authorized by the president and the faculty committee on
athletics .of Grinnell to inform the Missouri Valley conference that
Grinnell will withdraw from the copfcrence, and wishes June 1, 1939.
to be set as the effective date of withdrawal.

An interim of 18 months before the actual retirement has been
fixed as desirable for the following reasons:

1. It will give the conference and Grinnell ample time for

n. readjustment of their affairs.

2. Certain obligations have been entered into between van-in
ous members of the conference and Grinnell under the
assumption that Grinnell would be a member of the con-
ference, and Grinnell wishes to respect all such commit-

meﬂts.

Since the above obligations include the pmﬁ ipiitiou of

Grinnell in a conference

football schedule in 1338, it

seems proper that Grinnell should continue to partici—
pate in all conference sports during the year 1938-39.
Grinnell has not come to this decision without vcry careful con-

sideration.

It would set forth the following facts no logically lead—

ing to the decision that has been made:

1.

The distances

between Grinnell

and the other con-

Traveling expenses, both for Grinnell and for visiting

Grinncu is playing outside of her class, as regards

athletics. There is no reason to believe that she will

ever be athletically equal to most of the other members.

It seems wise, therefore, not to attempt to continue

longer an undesirable situation.
