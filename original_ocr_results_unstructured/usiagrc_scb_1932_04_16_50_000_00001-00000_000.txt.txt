sixth inning to keep the score tied at
s-all, and then failed to score until
the tenth, when each team pushed
across one run. Teraberry got the
benefit of the.breaks thruout the
game, but he pitched a masterful
game.

the best pitching pertormancc of the
season when he set the Smith hall
team back with only two hits, tan-
ning ninc men. The game was dull
and listless, and marred by cold
weather.

The Rawson team acquired an
early lead, and breezed thru to an 3
to 3 win. The victory left Rawson at
the top of the league with two vic—
tories and no defeats.
