WORLD PROBLEMS
STILL UNSETTLED

New World to Come Out of More
Suffering Says Steiner.

Dr. Edward‘A. Steiner gave an ad-
dress at chapel Monday morning on
some phases of the future world situa-
u'ou.

Dr. Steiner regards the war as not
only far from settling world proh-
icins. but as bringing up a great num-
ber of per-pie. rig ones. The much-
heralded new world has not yet come
into existence. he helieves. but is to
he hnrvn amid mole pain and snffeling
instead of being calmly and easily es-
tablishcd

in view of these increasing prohlenrs
of world importance. Dr. Steiner earn-
estly urged a closer attention to the
choice of a'lite work with the DBX'FDSB
of being or real value in their solur
tion. He believes that the world will
be more and more insistent on a real
contribution hour every individual,
and more intolerant of idleness.
