knew Miss Read Could he in doubt
that she was a great woman," he

strength than to ask others to take
Dve rher work."

‘ Unemployment ’
Strong’s Topic
Wednesday Night

Twenty-three Grinnell college stu-
dents snd townspeople heard Earl D.
Strong, professor of economics. dis«
cuss the present unemployment situ-
ation in the United States at a meet-
ing in the Uncle Sam’s club headquar-
erS Wednesday evening at 3 o'clock.

In his speech, entitled “Why Unem-
ployment ?" Mr. Strong explained
the various types of unemployment
which, as he outlincd them, are those
which are technical in nature, those
which are cyclical or concurrent with
depressions, those seasonal, and also
those types due to the inability to
work.

He then emphasized the three evils
of capitalism, war, the profit system,
and the disproportionate distribution
of wealth, which are causing depres-
lsion and unemployment today.

In conclusion Mr. strong suggested
several remidles for unemployment
leaving to the audience the method
which would bc the most suitable for
combating the situation.

New Rules Cause Changes

in Pioneer Tactics

By MAX moss

With only one week remaining be—
fore the opening encounter on the
Pioneers 1932~3s basketball schedule,
Coach J. C. Truesdale is faced with
the difficult task of whipping a team
into shape before the Squad leaves
for Minneapolis next Friday. The first
opponent on the Grinnell card is the
University of Minnesota quintet, 'Big
Ten championship contender.

Just who will make the trip to
Minnesota is problematical, although
it is certain that Truesdale's most
frequently-used combination of Cap-
tain Duncan and Mason, forwards;
Phelps, center; and Ullrich and Me»
Cully, guards will go

Chooses Tcntntirc Lineup

The Pioneer coach has been forced
to decide on a tentative lineup and
drill that group hard, and it will be
during Christmas vacation that he
will get his first chance to thorough-
ly test all of the men on the squad.

It is not assured that the above
quintet will start the game, for Bob
Morgan, guard, makes up in height
what he lacks in ability to handle
the ball and may be needed at the
backcourt position. If thc new tens
second rule proves to be a handicap

Latest Regulations

on Umpires

thn the 193273 basketball sea-
son gets under way in about two
weeks, several new rules will make
the play much different than in past
seasons.

One of the most important rules
was made to stop stalling, and states
that when a team gains possession
of the ball in its own back court, it
must advance it beyond the center
circle within 10 seconds. Failure to
observe this rule gives the opposite
team the ball out-of-bounds.

Io Second Ilule

The team gets another Io seconds
in the back court if a try for goal
has been made; a jump ball has been
called; the ball has been recovered
from the opposition.

Another rule states that a man
standing in the foul circle or lane

se'conds. This hits the offense of a
team that has a tall center who
hangs onto the ball with his back
to the basket. Failure to follow this
rule gives the ball to the opposite
team out-of-bounds.

Legal mocking:

Another rule legalizes some types
of blocking. Under this rule a man
must come in contact with the op»
posing player to be penalized for
blocking, while "screening," block»

The penalty for “blocking" is still a
personal foul.

Under the new rulcs a man may

he comes in ’contact with the oppos-
ing man whilc running in front of

These new rules place much more

Gitta Gradova
Recital Friday
Amazes Critic

Flint. Mallack Lauds Modern
Trend

on Gas’

to ‘Step

By HARRY w. MATLACK
(Professor of organ)

If I should be so dogmatic as to de»
clare that the piano recital last eve-
ning by Mme. Citta Cradovn was the
most astonishing thing of its kind
that has cver taken place in Grinnell.
doubtless my colleagues would fill
the air about my head with verbal
brickbats. But nothing can stop me
lfrom feeling that it was, to me at
least, exactly that; and I will try to
explain why.

In the first place it was an exhilar-
ating display of how the rising new
pianists are stepping on the gas. Like
other youngsters of her generation
Mme. Gradova knows no speed limi .
Piano music has left the era of pow—
dered wigs and stagercoaches, in
which much of it was written, far
behind, It now rides on the wings of
the air, and we have to hang on as
best we can or be thrown into the
ditch.

Never Lost Rhythm

But the imporosnt thing about
Mme. Gradova's playing is this, that
in her most dizzy flights she never
lost her grip on the rhythm nor her
sense of direction. In the Chopin
scherzo, for example, the tonal
stream flowed in vast sweeping par-
abolic curves like Roman candles
from an airplaneiand how impossi—
gble it was to recognize in this scher-
izo the battered horse of ambitions
.pianists who have for years been
dragging it bumpety-bump through
dreary exhibitions. Mme. Gradova
ltdkes her music off the ground; it
soars, and if once in a while it leaves
her listeners a little up in the air, the
.reviving droughts of} pure ozone we
get on the way up make us forget
iour bewilderment.

But this is less than half of it.
Mme. Gradova. so far beyond tech-
nical inhibitions that music ﬂows
from her fingers like the tones of an
orchestra, penetrates the inner mys-
teries of piano music and throws
them into brilliant relief. Here again
is the rising light of the new era in
piano music, taking its cue from the
orchestra, and using all the striking
features of contrast, powerful
rhythm, and varieties of tone-color
that the modern orchestra has solved.

Making History

At last piano music has left the ins
flucncc of the harpsichord and clavi-
chord, in which it spent its infancy
a hundred years ago. far behind. It
is making itself a. new world of ex-
pression. This is, historically speak-
ing, America's unique contribution to
the art of music, for piano music had
to be a feeble and ineffectual thing
until Babcock and Chickering, early
in the 19th century, invented the cast
iron frame which made the modern
piano possible.

Thc piano of Beethoven’s day, to
say nothing of the clavichord of
Bach, would havc been smashed into
a thousand pieces before Mme. Crae
dovo had gotten half-way through
her first number. The American pi-
ano permits the enormous range be-
tween the very softest and the very
loudest that Mme. Gradova uses
win such powerful effect, and it
yields the long singing tonc whose
possibilities, after threeaquarters of
a century of experiment, still seem
inexhaustible.

, Diftidcncc .

Mmc Gradova approaches her art
with the diffidcnce of a sophomore
about to play hcr first piece at a
student recital. Throughout a long
program of music drawn from the
most crudito sources she left the
platform only once; there was not a
single example of the cute little
tricky piece played M. the end of a
group to draw a salvo of applause.
She worc a black velvet gown to
match the piano, with white ”ruclh
ings," I believe that is the term, to
match the ivory keys, and her eh—
scmblc was indeed symbolic of the
extraordinary raptncss with which
she devoted herself to her instru-
ment.

In the powerful opening numbers
by Bach, where, if anywhere. depth
