rm recent actions or the Preps
have somewhat disturbed the
general routine of college lileland have
called forth the general condemnation
of a majority oi the college students,
yet the real cause tor the disturbance
is not very generally understood and
the Preps deserve some sympathy tor
the cause ior which they are contend-
iugr For several years it has been the
custom of the Freshman class to vote
in such members or the Senior Auade~
my class as honorary members who
would be able'to graduate with them.
It is all right for any Academy stu-
dent who intends to make the Fresh
man class to become an honorary
Freshman but the practice this year
has gone rar beyond the limits or past
years and many Junior and ﬁrst year
Preps are honorary Freshmen and are
giving theirsupportto '09. This has
demoralized the Academy classes to
such an extent that it has been al-
most impossible to have a class meet-
lng or class party. The obiect or the
Preps was to start something that
would arouse some class spirit and to
give those who really are Academy
students a chance toshow where they
beiong. The means which the Acade-
my students used to secure this end
may not have been the best yet they
undoubtedly aroused some class spirit
and class unity, Along this line may
also be mentioned the practice of the
college lilerary societies in having
members oi the Lewis Literary pledge
themselves to this or that society.
We are informed on good authorlty
that this worked a positive harm to
the “Lits’ last veer brciuse it [and
ed to divide the sori-ty into two lacs

the college should interiere in Acude~
