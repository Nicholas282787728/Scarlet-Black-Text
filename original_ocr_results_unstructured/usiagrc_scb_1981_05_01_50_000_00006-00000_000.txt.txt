Dressed To Kill

Starring Angle Dickinson, Michael
Caine, Nancy Allen

Directed by Brian DePalma

1980/104 min.

Sat., 8 p.m.. ARH; Sun., 3 p.m., ARH

I must first of all admit to a bias in
iavor oi anything that DePalma directs
since I have been a tan of his ever since
Phantom o! the Paradise. For those of
you who have followed his Career with
less enthusiasm than I have, he also
directed Sisters, The Fury and of
course Carrie, DePalma is a great {an
of Alfred Hitchcock and many of
DePalma‘s thrillers have been com-
pared to the work oi that wella
established master. It has been said
that DePalma does for elevators in
Dressed To Kill what Hitchcock did {or
showers in Psycho.

Nevertheless, Dressed To Kill has
received a lot or bad publicity since be-
ing released. Many feminists are upset
by the rilm because they tool it presents
an unfair image of women. Their argu~
ment rests on the assumption that
DePalma is trying to use Angie Dickin-
son's character to make a statement
about what happens to women who are
unlaithiul to their husbands. This is
equivalent to saying that the ﬁlm Car~
rie is anti-religion since its message is
that all religious parents will be killed
by their children, who will receive
supernatural powers. obviously, this is
not the case 7 these films are about in
dividuals, They are not intended to and
should not be thought of as representing
any particular group.

The ﬁlm starts out with Kate Miller
(played admirably by Dickinsonl tan
tasizing in the shower while her hus-
band shaves. Questioning her sexuality,
she then goes to see her psychiatrist,
Dr. Elliot, who is very convincingly
portrayed by Michael Caine. Mrs.
Miller ls killed (rather bloodily) in an
elevator by a razor-wielding blonde
woman alter having an airair with a
man she met in a museum and the
mystery begins. The only witness to the
murder is a highpriced call girl named
LIZ Blake, who is played by DePalma's
wile, Nancy Allen. Dennis Franz is ex-
cellent as the somewhat crude but
always realistic Detective Marine, who
cons me hooker into doing most oi his
work. She teams up with the murdered
woman's son Peter, beautifully por-
trayed by Keith Gordon. Between the
two at them. with just a little bit of help
irom the police, they manage to solve
the mystery but I won't tell you how.

For my money this is the best tilrn to
come on campus during the three years
ive been here tyes better even than
Citizen Kanei. DeFalma s influence
over the film is tremendous, as it is in
all his films He creates a wonderful at

6

mosphere for the film; nearly impossir
ble to describe on paper but very effec-
tive in a thriller, The acting is very
good all around including Angie Dicklnr
son, whom I have never liked before
now, Your owe it to yourself to see this
one, if you haven’t already, but stay tor
the end — DePalma likes to send his aur
diences out of the theater with their
hearts racing. ~ Tom Spackman

Desk Set

Starring Katherine Hepburn, Spencer
Tracy, Joan Elondcll

Directed by Walter Lang

1957/l03 min.

This is a really cute film 7 in a good
way, Tracy and Hepburn are again
delightful in their truly inimitable way
The plot revolves around the possibility
of replacing a reference department of
a broadcasting company with an
automated computer (yes, even in
195711). Anyway, Hepburn is wonderful
as head oi the research department,
There’s a territic Christmas party
scene and the whole movie is just lots of
fun. Try not to miss Desk Set. it’s a good
laugh. A Pamela Hulnick

Tom Jones

York, Hugh Griffith. Edith Evans
Directed by Tony Richardson

British, 1963/13l min.

What a wonderlul way to begin May!
Tom Jones is a Wonderful, bawdy film
which amazingly has lost very little or
the book’s great character. Based on
the novel by Henry Fielding (which you
all should have read by now), it's a
wonderful comedy of a young man's
coming ol age (especially focusing on
his trials and tribulations with women?
in 13th century England. The film loses
none oi Flelding's bawdy humor or
pace and it's really phenomenal! A
high-class comedy which is worth
whatever else you have to miss to see.
(Note: It won four Academy Awards in-
cluding Best Picture in 1963.) --
