When we last saw our heroes, Beth _
had just told James about a mysterious
skeleton found buried under the big
apple tree in Clyde’s front yard. .

After giving him a few seconds to absorb
this news, Beth let go of his apron strap and
let him sink down behind the countcrr

“I gotta get outta here,”]nmes said as he
began to make his way out from behind the
bar and pushed his way through the erowd.
"Leave mt: alone. I don’t want to know any-
thing about anything," But he felt Clyde's
hand tighten on his elbow.

“You are coming with us," Beth an-
nounced. She clutched the bug to her chest as
ifholding onto it was the only thing keeping
her standing. Behind her, Clyde tightened his
grip on James's elbow and nervously surveyed
the room, his eyes darting from pool table to
halt to the entmnce over and over again.

They walked out of the but, James lead-
ing with Clyde’s hand tight and white on his
elbow and Beth ti ailing behind clutching the
messenger bag {0 her chest.

in the parking lot, Clyde pushed James
toward his pick-up, opened the eab's door and
shoved him inside. The cab was
filthy, trash, cigarette hutts,a couple
ntwell-paged Playboys and several
empty beer cans. Shaving James
into the middle seat, he climbed in
behind the wheel as Bcth climbed
in th: passenger side.

After slamming the door cfhis
ouek, Clyde sighed, fumbled in
his packet for a cigarette and then
started the truck. l-le eased his way
out of the parking lot and onto the
highway

In the cab, it was silent except
for the sounds ofrhc truck’s engine
as James watched out the front window and
wondered why he had ever- decided to follow
them out to the parking lot in the ﬁrst place.
He hoped someone at the bar would recog-
nize that he was gone and do something.

Clyde was nervous The pit stains on his
T—shin were growing by the second as he
drove toward his {am out on Schooleﬂeld
road After about 15 niinutes of silence, Beth
spoke, .
“We're not kidnapping you, you know."

, James stayed silcnt.‘

“You have a skull in your baekpaek and I arr
just supposed to sit here doing nothing?”

"You just don't know the story."

“You‘re right. I don’t know the story. Wha‘
is the story?"

“Do you remember Matilda Warren?"

“That pimplyrraeed gumrehewer who
worked at the laundry mat?"

“Yeah, her."

“I never liked her. Whenever I sent m.
clothes to her I always lost stuff. Mostly socks,
James crossed his arms across his chest.

“Well, four years ago she disappeared."

“Everybody said that she’d run away wirl
that Lr ‘ng encyclopedia salesman."

“Yeahwcll, that's what everyone said, but ..
also abour tour years ago, strange things sorted

“Matilda."

“Some traveling salesmen, eh."

“Well she, even after death, has contin

”What .. this is legitimate!”

“Yeah, it is totally the single sock and oth .
