QUEER AUTOCRACY

Friday morning papers carried news of
a charge made by Massachusetts Governor
Hurley that the proposed child labor amend»
ment was a path to “autocl'acy.”

’Governor Hurley lashed the measure as
an opening for “compulsory military train-
ing, involuntary work on public projects,
forced attendance in concentration camps,
and restriction of religious education ” Fur-
ther, he declared it a “staggering gl nt of
power” to Congress. The govemor cited no
particular phrases to prove his criticisms
and in so doing made his argument quite
incomprehensible.

The amendment as it now stands pro-
poses to give Congress the right to regulate
child labor, that is, Congress may set hour
and age limits and make other legislation as
it sees fit. The amendment does not require
that Congress exercise this grant of power
but merely confers the privilege of enacting
such legislation

By so doing, it takes n‘way from any in—
dividual state the right of regulation, to the
extent that it gives national laws priority
over any state law without actually for—
bidding th state to pass regulatory laws.
The provi 'on thus not being compulsory
leaves little room for an accusation of ”stag-
gering grant of power."

State regulation has proved inadequate
in operation because states having no child
labor laws have provided not only unfair
competition for states having such laws but
have avoided their responsibility toward the
welfare of their citizens National regula-
tion will do away with these difficulties in
providing a single law applicable to all.

We fail to understand how Governor
Huley could see ill the p oposed amendment
compulsory military training, and as it now
stands, it would appear to be the only some
solution for an evil which has too often
been an integral part of mass production
for huge profit. G ~J.P.
ON THE GATES LECTURES

Once again the annual Gates Memorial
lectures will be given on the Grinnell cam-
pus, and once mole an outstanding leader
in social Christianity will be brought to the
college.

To the old students, the Gates lectures
are well-known as thought~provokillg ses-

sions, which clearly show the present-day
trends of Christianity. These studelltslinow
the value of the lectures

To the new students a bit of explanation
of what the lectures are, may help. This
will he the 23rd in a series of lectures on
social Christianity established as a lnemore
ial to the second president of" Grinnell,
George A. Gates. Dogmatic I ligion is not
considered, but rather a living- religion
which takes into account the trends of
present social set-up. This is a problem
which appeals to all college students Other
phases of this question will be discussed on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday

Needless to say, the lectures are worth
attending, and the topic this year, “This
Human Life,” offers a vast field for the
speaker. Attend if you can, for they will
be well—worth hearing.

SYPHILIS A DISEASE, NOT A DISGKAL

(Iowa State ,studcnti

Each day more people are coming out from be»
hind century old, stiffenecked standards, casting
aside the impeding code of another. less lightened
age which, horrified, erred, “Hush! for shame!"
whenever “immentionable” social ills were so much
as hinted at. such refusal to call a spade for
what it was, such hypocrisy, rules no more, thanks
to a. few farsighted individuals. The war against
syphilis is on!

The keynote of the war is “Syphilis is a disease,
not a disgrace.”

Recently the United states public health service
held a conference in Washington, D, C., on vener-
eal disease control. It found that syphilis is defin-
itely preventable and curable, A $25,000,000 apt
propriotion from the federal government is asked
to help Wage the fight. That is less than 20 cents
per capita.

The Iowa state Medical society is cooperating
with the state department of health in the effort
to conquer the disease. Iowa has $25,000 already
and more is expected from both the federal and the
state government. Free medicine and laboratory
facilities Will he available to Iowa physicians in
combatting the disease. In addition, a case-re-
porting sci-vice has been formed which will keep
an accurate check on all cases and see that follow-
up treatments arc given until the disease is cured,

it is estimated that less than 15 percent of the
cases are now reported and that there exists about
6,500,000 cases in the United States, or more than
75,000 in Iowa. About one person in 20 is affiic
ed. syphilis takes on annual toll of many lives,
causes 15 percent of all blindness, is responsible
for much insanity, and leaves many persons with
crippled bodies,

Syphilis, especially when taken in the early
stages is curableimuch more so then tuberculo»
sis. And we know more about it than we do
about cancer. It isn't that we do not have the
means or knowledge of making syphilis an uncomr
mon disease, but that tohoos and a criminal ree
fusal to recognize the necessity of taking action
have kept us from the war so long.

Hats off to common sense!

YOUTH CONSERVATION

(Oklahoma Daily)

There is one phase of the New Dears emer
gency relief projects that has won a permanent
place in the hearts of the American people. That
is our ccc camps. It is a happy thought that
there is a great deal of assurance of this session
of Congress transferring this project from the,
field of temporary work to a position of perman-
ence among-the institutions of the national govern-
ment.

With all the criticisms heaped upon the various
emergency agencies. criticism of the CCC has
been practically nil. Thousands of young men,
unable to ﬁnd private employment, unable to ,go
to school or to do anything that would aid them in
shaping themselves into useful citizens, have learn-
ed trodes that will always be helpful to them in
later life.

They have been taken from slums, from tern
ant farms, from villages, from the road. from an
idle life that would have tempted some to crimc,
and placed in a wholesome atmosphere with
worthwhile work to perform. They have been
given food, Clothing, shelter, training, and far
more important, they have been given something
to raise their morale.

Another important feature of this program
has been the kind of work assigned to the camps;
the conservation of soil. of forests, the beautificar
tion of parks, the huiluiri of dams and other
things that will be beneficial to the nation in
years to come. But of more vrtal significance
than the conservation of natural resources has
been the conservation of many thousands of young
Americans.

 

Critic Terms Art Exhibition l
of Chicago Galleries ‘Conservrative’ I

 

By HENRY ALDEN

A collection of eight paintings
by members of the Chicago Gale
lei-res association is on exhibit at
the quadrangle. In contrast to
the recent exhibition, the present
show is frankly coriscrvntive; ev-
eryone would agree that almost
any one of the canvases would fit
unobtrusively into the quiet, ,pcacc-
ful interior of most drawrng looms,
They blend r-estfully into the pleas-
ant background of the Main hall
corridor.

Charles P. Killg‘ore, one of whose
Mexican scenes was in last month s
display, is likeWise present in this
group. if is rritercsting to note
that whereas his “Tuxco Malkct"
was one of the loss mcmorable and
exciting pictures of the other col-
lection. his "Carmel Coastlia bet-
ter work, to begin withistands
out as one of the more striking
canvases in this group. The color»
ing is brighter, more luminous, and
the composition is unusual,

All in all, the Chicago Galleries
have sent us an agreeable array of
charming landscapes that include
a bit of English coast with a wide
expanse of beach and sea, a Vet»
morit hillside. and a, sun bright-
ened valley in the Great Smokies.
It is difficult to choose among the
pictures; they all represent com~
potent painting, pleasant coloring,
and sound composition.

As a group they lack variety;
they are not provocative, but they
are most likable. Mention must
he made of ”Jungle Experts" by

Rev. H. V. White
to Speak Sunday
at Vespers

The Rev. Hugh Vernon Whitc,
D. D., secretary of the American
Board of Commissioners for For-
eign Missions, in Boston, Mass,
will deliver the Vespers address
Sunday afternoon at 4:45 o‘clock
in Herrick chapel.

Dr. White will be here in con-
nection with the annual Fellowship
conference and Gates lectures to
he held next week and Will speak
at the Congregational church Sun-
day morning.

Two Men in Hospital
With Influenza Attack

Two men students were sent to
Community hospital this week
with cases of flu, while another
had recovered sufficiently from
torrsilitis to return home last ove-
hing.

Mark Conkling ’39, who has been
ill with tonsilitis since Tuesday,
was the student dismissed from
the hospital last evening.

Hal Hardin ’38, went to the hos-
pital Thursday, and John Olson '33,
was taken there Friday afternoon.
Both men suffered attacks of flu.

Facully ,Entcrlainment
Plans C om plated“

Arrangements for inviting facul.
ty membcrs to the dormitories for
dinner were completed at the
meeting of the Council of House
Presidents Thursday evening.

Doyl Evans. and William Fowler
were appointed a committee to see
about obtaining definite hours for
college men to use the Elks Club
bowling alleys, which are located
in town.

Blackburn College malcs pulled
uie wool over their own eyosi
wool or cotton, before g'oing' to
the last dance of the scnicster. It
was an informal “swcater affair"
with no suits allowed.

 

 

Julius Moesscl, an amusing "moh-
key" poi-trait with a touch of set-
tire, iirid of "Texas Cow Puncher"
by Joseph A. Fleck. This portralt
is notable because of a certain
simplicity in the drawing and col-
ormg and because of the rather une
conventional placing of the figure
in shadow against a lighter back-
ground. A distinct personality
seems to emerge from the canvas
as one studies it
hand, “The Marquis," the only
other human portrait in the group,
suggests rather strongly the ,pro-
fessional model dressed up in spon-
ish clothes.

Attractive coloring, able crafts-
manship, pleasant subjectsiwhat
could better suit the relaxation of
the post-exammation period?
