WAR IN THE GULF:
Facing facts and
developing
opinions

Theissue ofAmerican involvement in the Persian Gulf
provokes many different reactions that are as numerous
as the people who express an opinion. However, the root
of that very expression lies in the communication of that
opinion to others. One’s opinion is inconsequential ifit
is kept bottled up inside a head, and this is the very
problem which surrounds opinion of American
involvement abroad. Too
many people are undecided
about this urgent issue.
Opinion polls convey
widely swinging majorities
ofopinion,ﬂuctuatingfrom
day to day. . , .

This acquiescence to the status quo should be
considered unacceptable. If Grinnell College students
pride themselves as being bright, decisive, and active,
they must not keep opinions reserved or qualify those
opinions to thepointof indifference. Events havereached

a critical point in the Persian Gulf since the college broke
for Christmas. On December 16,the prospect of war was
only a dim one, with many diplomatic options being
deployed ,on both sides. On January 1?, the United States
had commenced the largest military action sinceVietnam,
a distant memory in every students‘ mind.

This sense of urgency is heightened by the fact the many
of our friends and even schoolmates are or will be
ﬁghting in the Gulf. If the war continues much longer
than twomonths, Congresswillraisethe issue ofthedraft
once again, meaning even more students will be called

, into military service.

Students must make their voices heard. They must not
be called to action, they must call themselves to action.
It does not matter if one is supportive of or opposed to
active military intervention, one must voice his or her
concerns with our involvement, or voice approval of
America’s actiOn. Student apathy plagued this campus
all last semester. This apathy should not continue,
Human lives are at stake, and soon that life may be your
own. ,

Reﬂections About Break

Hercwcall arc,backatGrinnell.
Breakis ovcr- finally. lhadtime to
think about things over break.
Plenty of time. One subject that
kept creeping into my slumbering
intellect was the value of my
Grinncll education.

At Grinnell, we learn how our
society manipulates us. The
realizauonoftheeffcctsofdtemedia
and our culture on our personal
views is an exciting learning
experience in the classroom.
However, when we are tossed out
ofourUlopia ofawareness, we face
alonclhcftghtagainstlhepowerful
inﬂuence of these factors.

IwatchedalotofTVovcrbrcak.
Every advertisement screamed
sexism, hetcroscxism, racism,
cthnoccntrtsm, and manipulation.
I pointed out some of the more
obviousoffcnscs to my parents.but
they just sort ofgrunted, glad I was

I‘ve written several papers in
which I explained that the most
important way to fight oppression
istospeak outin diplomatic protest
whenever someone makes an
oppressive remark in a
conversation. I have been able to

do this in most situations. Over
break, however, I went to visit
Grandma.

Grandma was raised in a shack
in southern Indiana, and her views
aren't exactly liberal. She’s 74
years old, wittch isn't too old for a
lot of things, but I suspect it might
be too old to unleam the biases and
prejudices that she was brought up
with. My parents and l Sat around
the table chatting with her, and shc
didn’t have much to say. The only
words others thath ave stuck in my
mind 'camc in the middle of a
conversation, perhaps about
politics. I don’t really remember
much except that she felt a need to
want me, in an offhandcd remark.
about “them niggers.” l’m sure a
look of shock crossed my face. 1

wasn't that a rather racist
comment?“ All thateducation, all
that understanding served only to
frustrate the as I realized that I
would risk a family fight if I said
anything at all. My parents would
have been upsetthatl hmughtitup,
despite their own anti-racist views.
and Grandma would have been

astounded that I expressed

So I said nothing, and soon left

I was in the real world, and decided
that this pain could be a very
productive sort of pain. If, after
four years of this opening of our
minds, we venture out into society
and feel this pain every time we
know something is wrong, we are
bound to do something about it.
We may interrupt conversations
when we can. We may refuse to
laugh at jokes that make fun 0
stereotypes. We may actively wet
to shape society as we enter the
work force. And, perhaps most
importantly, we may teach on
children to accept people and not be
led blindly by cultural inﬂuenccs.

Dear Grinnell campus,

WHATS GOING ON HERE?

Sunday, is Super Bowl Sunday ,
which makes this Saturday, Janlﬁ,
the perfect night for the second'89—
'90 Haines third reunited PrerS uper
Bowl Inebnaljon CelebraLion! So
the party preparations began:
posters for publicity, an approved
SGA budget, the usual party
formalities, and, most importantly,
we collected .1 lot of money from to
you to haven supcrkickrofffor the
Super Bowl. Then we're told by
administration, SGA and Student
Affairs that not only do we get to
kickoff the Super Bowl , but lhc
“official" opening of the Harris C
enter as well! So we passed on that
"official" news to you, which made
many of you excited and generous
in your contributions! The Harris
Center was finally going to open"

or so we were told, But we were
told wrong. Unfortunately for us,
by the time we found out that once
again the Harris Center was not
going to open, we had already
passcd on the "ofﬁcial" news to
you, which puts us in a difficult
position.

We will be having our party in
Gardner on that same night, and
even though it's not the Harris
Center, there‘s still a party! We
would like you to know that
although we realize that it is not
anyone'sfaultthatthcl-lttrrichntcr
will notbc open and that there is no
blame being placed on the
administration, SGA, or Student
Affairs, wc would also like you to
realize that it was not in ztny way
our intention to mislead you or
promote false excitement. After

all, we all probably sliduld hav
expected this! Our thanks I

everyone that went outof their wa

to help us when the Harris Ccntc
opening was once again delayed
and we hope to see you all at th

final Gardncr party this Saturday a
10:00pm. to celebrate th-
beginning of a new semester an

kickoff Super Bowl Sunday!
