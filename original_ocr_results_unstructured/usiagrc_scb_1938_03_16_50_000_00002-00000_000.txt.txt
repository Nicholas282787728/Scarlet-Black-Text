THE CHOICE IS OURS

For the past few weeks we have had the privilege of
having on this campus a man qualified by experience and
training to stimulate our interest in and add to our infor-
mation on the perplexing international problems facing the
world today.

In the series of lectures concluded last night, Dr.
Kotschnig has made no pretense of presenting an infallible
account of the situation in Europe today. Ill his teaching
of the contemporary history class and in the numerous
informal discussions he has participated in during the last
month, he has likewise tried more to stimulate further
interest in the subject than to present the last word.

It is now our responsibility as students, not merely in
name but in deed as well, to continue along the way in
which we have been stalted. Just as a horse may be led
to water and yet not be made to drink; so, while we have
been led to the fountain of intelligent interest in and under
standing of a complex but very pertinent question, there
is no one who can make us absorb this knowledge.

The questions discussed here during the last month are
of extremely pertinent interest as a reading of your daily
paper will make obvious. As college students, who will be
the voters and leaders of the next generation, we owe to
civilization as a whole, an earnest attempt to understand
the world in which we live. Information of all sorts is avail-
able to supplement the outline given us by Dr. Kotschnig in
the last month.

Ignorance and apathy lead to war; interest and knowl-
edge to peace. The choice is ours.

IN THE SPRING #G—

In the spring, a young man’s fancy turns to thoughts
of love, and, if present plans of the Student Council go
through, co-educational sports. And, incidentally, we aren’t
thinking of the same thing you are.

Seriously, however, the need for co-educational par-
ticipation in badminton, golf, etc, has been recognized as
desirable for some time. Specifically, proposals looking
toward this objective were introduced at the Student
Leaders conference in Brooklyn last fall.

From similar proposals at that conference, we have
seen the realization of the long felt desire for a student
recreation center, revision of the cut plan and numerous
other changes.

May we hope that the committees appointed to investi-
gate the possibilities of co—educational golf and badminton
will find ways to make this proposal as successful as the
others of the past year.

SUITABIE RECOGNITION

The action taken by the faculty committee on athletics
in making provision for the awarding of major letters to
wrestlers meeting special requirements is, we believe, a
step in the right direction

While this does not make wrestling a major sport, it
does hold out to those men who have wrestling ability the
possibility of winning a major award, while at the same
time leaving the system of minor letter awards in force

It is to be hoped that the faculty committee will not
stop with this action, however. Wrestling, under the capable
coaching of Guy Lookabaugh, has shown a decided gain
in favor here the past season and with this increase in
importance and popularity of the sport should come in»
creased importance so far as recognition is concerned.

DORIC

No“ it can he told. Charles
H. Willis, Tia, debate manager,
reveals why the major attraction
of this year’s debate card w s
censored. After completing
rangements with the University
of Chicago “Verbal warriors” for
a discussion debate to he hclrl
here last week to climax the dc-
bate season, Willis solicited pres—
idential approval. However, when
President Nollcn was inlenned
that the debate topics would be
either “Is work the downfall of

the drinking class?” or “Do cull--

dlen need their parents after two
years of age?” he turned thumhs
down on the proposition. Accord—
ing to Nollen, there 15 no drink
problem on this campus and the
Grinnell college students are not
sex conscious; hence, discussion
of any topic such as those above
would be preposterous.

Apparently basing his conten-
tion on the okl saw that “Ab-
sence makes the heart grow fond»
er," McAneney was willing to bet
$5.00 that he would be MISS
Hirsch’s “one and only" shortly
after she returned to the campus
after spring vacation. Latest
reports indicate, however, that
McAneney is not so sure of his

position.

George Infelt, Lungan's bid for
the title of “Rural Romeo,” has
another selling point. sunday eve—
hing after escorting the Carson
brunette [I never can keep the
twins' names straight) about for
several hours, he introduced a
new motif in romance. When he
returned to Lsngan, he phoned
Miss c. and sang “I Can Dream,
can't I?" to her via telephone.
