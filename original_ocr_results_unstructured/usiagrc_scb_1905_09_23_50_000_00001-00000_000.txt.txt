en the opportunity this arternoon of
seeing the varsity in action tor the

ﬁrst time this Season. Hard practice

has been the order oi the week, with
special attention to the signals.
Xothing but the more simple plays
will be tried today. Fumbllllg is fre-
quent as is usually the case at this
time or the year but the quality or the
practice has been such, that the hopes
for a last squad have not been dimmed.

It is probable that all or the new
men will be given a chance to play in
the game and it is a little diilicult to
pick the lineup. McCulloch at center
has been getting into Llle game this
week and his chances ior the place
look very good, For guards and tack-
les anumber or good men will be tried
out. Clack, McDonald, Risscr, Davis,
Pierce are all playing a strong game
and it is a toss up as to who will get
the places. Bleamaster and Jacobs
have been playing at ends but it is
likelythatCaptain Auracher dud Blea-
niastcr will ﬁll those positions. Valer-
ius has been out oi active practice
lor aicw days on account oi a wrench.
Led ankle, but he will probably enter
the game today, ll'atters played
