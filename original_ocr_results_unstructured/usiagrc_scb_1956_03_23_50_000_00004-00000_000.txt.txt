organized both by general types
of work and also by specific
companies, and is eross- iled. it
is “open an everyone intorested

tion."

Thornton cspocially plans to
build up the file in regard to
information about broad voca-
tional orcas, which should be
quite useful to undergraduates
in their vocational planning.
Since the placement bureau will
he moved over spring vocation
to the offices previously occu—
pied by the Congregational
Christian contcrence on the sec.
ond floor of the administration
building. the file will be found
there in the tuture.

Gnd School

Another area of activity for
the Placement bureau is provid-
ing graduate school iniormation.
Since about a third of all Crin—
nell graduates either immediate
1y or eventually go on to grad-
uate school. it is the policy of
both the college and Thornton
to stress future education
strongly.

Most at this work has been
handled by the dean of the
college in the past, but begin-
ning next year all information
about graduate school, such as
catalogs, scholarship and fel~
lowship announcements, gradu-
ate record exams, etc., will be

centered in (he Placement burr '

eau. Starting next tall, then,
students should contact Thorn-
ton for anything relating to
graduate school.

enu, and it wuld place many
more, he says. The average

is to promote iniormnl student-

Although the Placement hur—
oau is quite old, it has been
under the direction of many dif—
tcrent people in the past several
years. Since Thornton took it
over three years ago he has
added the continuity that was
lacking before, and has done
much to increase the services
otiered by the bureau.

WHAT’S THIS? For solution see porogroph below.

President Howard R. Bowen today announced admini3>
tration approval of coed eating on a voluntary basis for the
rest of the semester. The plan had been passed unanimous»
ly by the Social Calendar committee.

Dean R. Homer Norton said,
“On a voluntary basis, I think
it’s fine,” but he is not in favor
of compulsory coed eating.

Pershing Goosclaw, assistant
director of foods, said that the
present program was “working
out fairly well," but that some
problems would have to be
walked out before the new
system could run smoothly.

Some of the problems Goosee
lzlw mentioned were as Iollows:

Line cutting: “This has to be
taken care of," he said, “and dlSv
cipline Won’t get much better
in the spring."

Smoking problem in the Quad:
The girls have a rule against
smoking in the dining room at
breakfast and lunch. The men
do not.

Balance

The problem of balance has
tween the two dining rooms:
Goaselaw said that at least once
one dining room has run out and
food has had to be brought over
from the other one by truck.
From the standpoint of the men
and women splitting up iairly
evenly, the foods department is
pleased so far, he said. “HOW
long it will stay that way is an-

other matter.”

"Everyone seems to be
happy right now," Gooselaw
said, “but what about when
the newness Wears 0“? Will
the students still like it after
tw‘o months?"

One drawback, he said, “is
that it is handier for the men
to go from the Union or the
Music building over to the Quad
to eat, than it is for the,women
to go to Cowles from ARK. it
seems to be about equal dis»
tance to both dining rooms trom
there.”

i
started Last Year

The coed eating program was
started as an experiment last
year by the Student Council,
Miss Gardner said. The blue-
and»red-ticket-at-dinner p l a n
didn’t work out so well, she said,
“because it was too formal.
Having it at lunch is much more
successful,"

This year's plan was investi—
gated by a four—member com—
mittee appointed by the Student
Social committee. The sub—

committee members were Anne
Beuckman, Chris Nielsen,
Holmes,
