Praise be to
prognostication

Arrer the sports doldrums that are February
and early March, my tavonre tnne of the year
has arrived: the starr or the baseball season.
Not only does ir mcnn rhar I will be spending
an inordinare amounr orrime watching MLB.
com's gameeast, but ir also signals the cud or
other sports seasons. The jostling atop rhe
NBA’s Western Conference leaves six reams
within a couple games, but, as the actual
playorrs sccm to linger on longer than a Yao
Ming roor injurymid Golden Stare is currently
on the outside looking in, I'll be turning
clscwhcrc ror my plilyoFfaction.
Unrorrunareiy ror [he NHLiwhich has
rhe mosr exciting playoffs or any sportirhc
ﬁrst player to score 50 goals in over a decade,
Alexander Ovechkin, may not even be in
the posrseason. When they signed AO re a

Minnesota MirarieMan

contract that put Rick DiPicrro to shame, the
Capitals probably expected at least a playoff
birth. But, as he has no Hot Saucc or The
Professor to partner with, the team's succcss
will have to wait.

Of course my favorite part of this time of
year is the predictions made by every sports
analyst on every network and website across
rhe country regarding the upeoming baseball
season Sure, it’s easy to watch Steve Phillips
and laugh, bur ir is hard work coming up with
predierions rhar time and time again fail to even
come close to what happens in realiry. 1 mean,
I am terrible with making picks, bur even I will
sometimes stumble upon the righr one. Bur to
honor the legacy of Steve Phillips, 1 will share
with you a couple of my own predictions that
I hope can hold their own with the ﬁfthrbest
general manager the Mets have ever had.

The Seattle Mariners and the New York
Mars will play in what will be considered
the secoudrgrcarcst World Series of all time
(number one, naturally, being 1991) With
four one-run games and three pirchcrs' duels
berween fellow Venezuelans Johan sanrana
and King Felix, the home teams will win all
the games, for only the fourth time in league
history. Regrertably for the Mets, an Alex
Gordon sac~ﬂy oi? of Ian Snell will be the
deciding factor in the AllsStar game giving the
AL home ﬁeld advantage, and the Mariners
their ﬁrst World Series title.

As both 517ml: Il/irltmml and Phillips
predicted the Tigers ro win the World series,
It is only inevitable rhat aee Justin Verlander
will hurr his arm slipping on a McDonald’s
bag at the home of teammate Miguel Cabrera.
Cabrera will be so stricken with grief that he
will, ironically, turn to the one rhing that has
always made him feel better: food. By the time
the AllrStar break rolls around, he will have
grown to such immense proportions that he will
be unable (0 leave his own house. Fortunately
with the help it forklift, the same one used to
carry in all the money from his new eonrraer,
he will be able to makc it to the Tigers’ Final
home game as the team srill manages to ﬁnish
second in the AL Central.

Finally, prognosticarors all over the counrry
will be astounded when the Seattle Mariners
fail to win even 80 games, and in turn
will try to silence the most notable source
that accurately predicted their season: the
PECOTA "computer." Amazingly, PECOTA
becomes sentient and determines that the
grearesr rhrear to baseball is rhe very writers
rhemselves. Luckily, a ragtag group led by Joe
Morgan manages to save rhe baseball season
and the world. In gratitude, the BBWAA
allows Morgan ro be rhe sole vote ror all year-
end awards,lcading to your AL and NL MVP:
being the same person: Dave Concepcion.
