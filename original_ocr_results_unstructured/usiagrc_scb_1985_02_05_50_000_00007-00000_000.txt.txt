Management skills may be part of farmers’ plight

by licoecoa Weston
* Like “cancer spreads. . . . the long ten»
Lacles oi the problem . . . move atawesome
speeds . you hardly know what hit you."
said Dr, Niel s. Harl. the Charles F, Cur-
tiss distinguished Professor oi Economics
at lowa State University. Harl. atconvocar
lion last Thursday. was referring to the
agricultural crisis that is said to be the
worst this nation as experienced since the
1930's.
r Harl began his lecture by dispelling
several myths people have about are
agricultural crisis, Rather than involving
a low people. the problem eiieets not only
the iarmers. but their investors and sup»
pliers. Furthermore. although some
tarmers do lack management skills. most
oi those who are in trouble possess the
necessary skills to survive in a healthy
economy
it is not only a local problem. Though the
~‘-‘central states are suiiering the greatest
trauma, Harl said thecrisis is virtually
nation wide." Harl cited California as an
example oi a state that has been iorced to
receive help irom the Federal Reserve
l‘soard in recent months
. Using data that were released last week,
l-larl pointed out that approximately 28
percent oi all iarmers are in debt to the
oi nt oi insolvency That iigure reaches 42
percent in the Central States.
. Harl continued his lecture by explaining
the diiierencc between what he cited to be
wthe inexorable iorces oi eiiiciency and a
tragedy oi awesome proportions. ' in the
past. Harl said. poor agricultural eondi
lions were largely the results oi attempts
at creating a more eiiieient system tie.
iewer. but larger iarms, improvements in
machinery, breeding. and managementt.
- Today. said Hail. the causes oisuch poor
conditions are oi varying natures. in his
lecture. Harl blamed several iactors.
iany phenomenon or set oi phenomena
that causes the iarmer vulnerability” lior

machinery made at the wrong time]. and
tallen land values. "The single most imr
portant iactor Harl said is the very high
real interest rates,
4 interest rates eiiect virtually every
tarmer in many ways. said Harl. Suppliers
in seed. chemicals and machinery (etc)
,suifer from the high rates, and therefore.
must compensate tor their additional ex-
)penses — making it more costly {or
iarmers both to produce and carry an inn
‘venlory, Harl explained. In simpliiied
terms. it costs the iarmer more to produce
less.
4 Harl next explained what he regarded as
the principle cause oi the high interest
rates. The high rates are caused, in part.
.._by a “severe mismatch oi iederal income

a

t

and federal spending . . . the deficit.” Harl
said, In the late 1970's, the high budget
deﬁcit that had accumulated in the earlier
part oi the decade was nearly controlled

Because the Federal Reserve Board
limited the supply or credit available to
farmers. while at the same time cutting
taxes. the deficit began to climb in the
1980's. Harl explained Harl continued,
saying that the “private and government
lsectorsl compete for capital, thereiore
keeping rates high,"

The long term effects of this crisis are
many. Harl predicted that the interest
rates will continue to climb unless the
country enters into a recession itegarding
this prediction. Harl said that “it is a sad
commentary ii [country' sl only hope out
of high interest rates is a recession

Furthermore Harl forewarned that
some Third World debtor nations will have
trouble sustaining such high interest rates
— adding more pressure on commerce
banks. Harl stated that this could be the
“beginning of a failure of [our] financial

institutions,”

Finally. Harl provided various alter-
natives open to iarmers in debt. He sug-
gested that they “scale down operations,
start over again, or tile bankruptcy." To
those on credit. Harl offered these
possibilities: ioreclose their property tone

forfeit thelr property (giving the land.
assets and debts included back to the

Harl did mention that the state could
issue a ”Debt Moratorium." This means
that it would be against state law to
ioreclose real estate mortgages. This
policy was iirst presented in 1935.

when asked why the economy appeared
healthy if the nation |S in a state of
agricultural emergency, Harl said it is
“not a healthy recovery it it is based on a
$215 billion deﬁcit."

Harl concluded by saying that we must
“stop this growing cancer before it con-
sumes" the country
