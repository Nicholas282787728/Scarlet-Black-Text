by Bill McClung and Joe Walka

Russia sends up a lunik, Castro triumphs in Cuba, Ike presents
a somewhat balanced budget. Amid all this, exploration, tumult

and legislation, “the jock element" passes out of existence. l

Some of you will lift your
eyes to the heavens and give
thanks to the power or powers
(whichever you prefer), some of
you will lift your’ glass of am—
ber ﬂuid and a tear will secrete
from your eye and ﬁnally, most
of you will not even notice. At—
tempting to put all these vari—
ables deep into our subconscious,
we will obiectively proceed in
this, our last column.

A round of thanks is deﬁnitely
in order. First, to Grinnell col»

We have had the privilege of

We feel a certain (undeflnable)

Probably our biggest aid thru

his journalistic advice has beenl
most helpful. Also to Harold
