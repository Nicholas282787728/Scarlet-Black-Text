Loous or NEWS.
By Julius Muller
‘Ve swing the headlong Looms that
weave .
Thl tales of human earth
Spun by the troubled continents
in agonies of birth.

TH

We watch the steady-turning globe
Upon its spindle hung;

Men‘s lives are as a twisted flax
Whose thread to us is ﬂung.

We weave: We weave! The sky may

rock,

Lands piss as smoke away;

We gather in the warps and weave
The Garment of the Day.

We braid their bliss, We braid. their
pain,
We braid men’s hopes and fears
We hnit their silks of joy and make
A pattern of their tears.

L0, we are old that once were young;
But never, east or west,

Has one of all the circling suns
Behold our Looms at rest.

The World was Vast, the world was
dim,
When ﬁrst that We were young;
And in the half-light of his time
Man walked dim fears among.

He Walked dim fears among, and saw
His brothers in the gloom

Lurk as half-devils till we broke
Hjs’ terrors with our Looms.

We snatched the scattered threads and
tied
The Incas face to face.
We tied the snndered lands that once
Stated blind across blind Snipe.

We knit men's hates, we knit men’s
loves,
We make the pattern whole
0: loves and hates, Behold! 'tls one!—
Humamty's great soul,

Throw us ymlr spoils, O Turkestan!
Ye tropics! Send your glows.

o ruined townsl Our pattern needs
Your somber thread of woes.

Strike, ravening armies! Flame, 0
fleets!
Rise, nations! Rise and spring!
High, high above your ﬂamers—Hark!

Our Looms are thundering.

held at Chicago in 1915.

Those. who cr icise the newspaper-
for the publication of sensational and
scandalous material should remember
that the newspaper is "the Monarch of
things that Are," as well as a dynamic
force in Public 0pi ion. News is

of the Press of America,

Those who criticise should l'ememv
her that less than four per cent of
the reading matter published in Amer-
ican newspapers if of a sensational or
scandalous character; and before con-
demning the Press for the harm that
it does, they should stop to think of the
vast amount at good that it has ac-
complished.

A few papers teature sensational
news, but the vast majority of them
relegate it to a second or third rate
position except in extreme cases. Mur-
ders and divorces and stock frauds are
a part of Life, and the function of
the Newspaper is to portray Life as it
ikmd not Life as the moralists, rc-
formers, and chapel speakers, how-
ever sincere they may he, would like
to see it. It is true that the News-
paper freduently has to portray the
sordid and seamy side of Life, and yet
the Press would be a fit object of
condemnation i! it did not do this.
The ideal of the Press is to throw the
light of Truth onto this evenchanging
Life of ours. No reform, no upward
movement, no prom-ess of the race
could he achieved without the Truth
before us. The object of most editors
who publish the sensational Truth is
to hold up to public ridicule, condem-
nation, and abhorrance, the things that
should not he. If they failed to do
this the world would be darkly iglml'r
ant. Only by knowing what is evil,
and by knowing that evil exists, may
we guard against it. And remember
that less than four per cent of Ameri—
can newspaper space is talten up with
Ibis kind of copy.

MISS EVELYN M. BOYD
Evelyn Mae Boyd, a recent member
of thc English dcuartmcn f at
Griunell College, was born in‘Oel-
wein, Iowa, where she spent the car-
1y part of her school life. Upon mov—
ing to Gl'ilmeil, Miss Boyd attended
Grinncll, where she graduated in 1913
After her course here she obtained
her Masters’ Degree from Chicago
University. Miss Boyd’s teaching exr
pericncc was gained at the’ state
Teachers College of Dekaib, Illinois.
After an indefinite stay at Grinnell,
Miss Boyd plans to resume further
graduate study at Chicago.
When asked her personal opinions
of Grinnellll, Miss Boyd stated, "I

l
lfeel towards this Dizlce as a person al-

ways fecls toward thc one place in
the universe callcd home, and Grim
ncll is home in cvcry sense of the
word to inc. My interest not olilyt
lies in the dcpartmcnt of English but ,
in every school activity. I apprccir
ate the Ltct that it is always a dif-
iicult thing for students as Well as
faculty to come in school at tho iuid-
dlc ol‘ uic year, and still be made onc,
hut Gl'illnell has that good spirit of"
hospitality and has always been noted l‘
for it. The fact that “she does not
makc quick decisions, but does malie‘
the ones which ahc stands by, is an
outstanding asset of Griilncll."

In Review
By liar-old N. sivnusou

To Millie :1. Choice. ‘

Nobody reads poetry, a few people
read plays. everybody reads historical
novels. Come two stirring tales of
the sea: CAPTAIN BLOOD by Rafael
Sabati-ni (I-Ioughto-n) and "1492" by
Mary Johnston (Little, Brown). And
1 am to tell you which is the betteril

It will be remembered that Sabatinl
wrote that very ﬁne story of the
French Revolution, "Scaramonchc",
which also was his third historical
novel. The gentleman is Italian—l
can't tell you if he is handsome. or
happily married. or is planning to be.
It does appear, however, that he has
found in Peter Blood, huccanccr par
excellence ,the colorful mystery of the
Spanish Main. For Captain Blood.

‘whether on the quarter-deck of his

good ship Arabella, or in other places
tao humorous to mention, is cold
blooded and a‘s sardonic a fellow withal
as your average book reviewer.

Mary Johnston gives much attention
to historical accuracy in her study of

so very much like to know how many

the Santa Maria. History Somehow;
fails to record the fact that the crew!

deviled eggs, and eggs boiled hard orl
soft. Was this because the lowly cggl
(per Culllmbus’ success in making one
stand on end) had brought them to‘
the edge of the World?

Come to think of it, this book is}
perhaps the most skillful study of the
Admiral. Mary Johnston has been al

Holt“, but this Should otlti'lista'uce
any of her historical romances. ‘
