A PRACTICAL METHOD

There" will be one more issue of The Scarlet
mid Black before the editor. business manager, and
staff members Slam down the battered ' lltop for
the last time of the academic year, Whilnl editors
and staffs in other colleges bid their readers a ﬁnal
farewell, however, the Grilincll management occur
pins 3 unique post in that it takes only a temporary
leave of absence during the summer.

The system of ti 'llillg‘ tllo papcr over to the
new management 15 issues before the close of the
college year has some disadvantages, to be sure, bill:
likewise there are many commendable features
about the policy, The old management is of ﬁrst
consideration and the mere fact that it is given
an opportunity to take part in gi-nduntion attii .
ties, a large part of which would be barred to the
editor and blisillc s manager if they were compelled
to spend tho usual amount of time publishing a
paper. is worth considering:

The p01' y here also has it Worthwhile advair
(age ill giving the new management a chance to
work into the duties of issuing the paper while the
well oiled svsteui of the former management is
still operating smoothly. It gives urwcoiners the
15 iéslies to follow the general polio . of fl‘lt‘ll‘
predecessors in the matter of makeup, s ‘lo, and
general workmanship. Thc llicrit 01' new ideas may
best be considered after the new men have handled
a few issues and are more intimately acquainted
with the individual problems which confront their
own paper.

There will be changes iii The Scarlet and Black
next year. The sub-banner which we, used througlr
out this year has not been deﬁnitely abandoned but
probably will sec little use unless it IS posslblc_to
use a lighter type. There will be some alteration
in the style of heads [or Stories and the editorial
column will continue to be ﬂexible, being cut as
advei'ti. iig runs high. There will probably be other
changes which will be put into effect if they are

found practical.

RULES AND RESPONSIBILITY
(From the Haverford News)

. What is the status of the Students' Association
rules at Havel-ford? Ideally, they are fair, few in mm
her, and necessary to the smooth working of the college;
the ideal picture also, however, shows undergraduates
both living up to them and taking full responsibility for
their enforcement. And it is in this last feature that
a large number of students are found wanting.

The rules concerning smoking on the campus, disc
orderly conduct in the dining room, and drinking are
practically the only ones to ever be broken. If they were
put up at 5. students’ Association meeting, they would
be adopted almost unanimously. That being the case,
the undergraduate is face to fa/Ce with :t clear-cut issue
—to observe them himself and make_others do the same.

There are few who would deny this to be their duty;
there are few who would take any measure of reﬁning.
bility. We deplore this tendency, not because the college
is falling into disrepute through violated rules, but be-
cause it shows a lack of mature consideration of the
importance of things, We feel that every student should
foniider the question, take a deﬁnite stand, and adhere
o i .

Is it better to disregard a practically non-existent
campus liquor question or, with the rule there. to decide
what your duty would be if you did meet with a viola-
tinn? Do you elect your students Council to be polices
men—the only~ people responsible for the maintainanee
of the rules? Theoretically that it not your intention;
Why not bring the theory to practice, feel your responsir
bility and make your full contribution to your college?

GE
ATHLETICS
(From the Beloit Round Table)

The effort and expense of grooming a few men to
represent a college in intercollegiate athletic contests
seems rather futile. it would be much more logical if
this energy were spent upon all the men of a school
instead of this gifted few. Generally these who receive
athletietraining in college have been trhiried for years
before, whereas the physical training of the remainder
has consisted of gym classes, for the most part, since
the days of corner lot competition. The few are con»
sistently trained; the many are consistently neglected,
and, as often as not, regaled for not showing enough
interest in the few,

Intercollegiate athletics are coming in for their
full share of oritici m for poor practices, low standards,
and over-emphasis. Some schools have discarded them
altogether On the other band, intramural athletics, of
the type Offered in Beieit, are far from all inclusive and
fulﬁlling the ideal of giving each man a chance at some
sport,

Beloit 15 facing a. serious problem in its athletic
situation. Ideally it is failing to create interest and ae-
ivity in sports to the extent it would like to and ought to.
Can it continue intercollegiate athletics at the present
pace without lowering its standards in order to get more
athletes? Or could it discontinue intercollegiate athletics
and emphasize the intramural sports without suffering
a drop in enrollment? The latter is certainly worth a
trial.

ﬁ Lee——
LIVE AND LEARN
(From the New York Times)

Quite as significant of the educational trend as the
immense growth in high school provision and in college
and university attendance during the last twenty years
has been the movement for adult education. What gives
it life and aim is the conception that education is a
continuing process through life—4m active, purposeful
effort and not a mere nassive receptivity. The Associar
tion for Adult Education, now holding its annual session
in New York, has no program of instruction and itself
employs no teachers, but cooperates with ﬁve hundred
organizations which have to do with various forms of
adult education both in the United States and abroad.

President Butler's statement that only a few persons
7‘3 very small millilriy”—contimie to grow intellect
ually after reaching the age of 23 or 24, and that there
are few whose intellectual and spiritual velocity still
rises at 40, suggests the need of such a gospel, especially
in this new era of increased leisure for all. Maeterlinek
is quoted as saying that on the way in which these iur
creased hours of freedom are spent may depend the
whole destiny of man, And one may not, in the face of
the results of Dr. Thorndike's researches into the adults
ability to go on learning, have an excuse for not Cour
tinuing to learn, even into old age.

it is predicted that the “feverish task of attempting
in a few years to cram facts enough into a child’s head
to last him for a lifetime" will within the oncoming
generation be abandoned. The new education will help
the child to make the most 01 its life as a child. And it
will treat everp period of life in the same way—aiding
the man who has “put away childish things“ to make
the most of himself. One hundred thousand men and
women are now taking home study courses offered by
nearly 150 colleges and universities. A recent stndy of
these course's pronounces them a “very necessary part of
our present educational system." several colleges and
universities are now beginning to assist their alumni
in continuing serious studies beyond college days. Radio
is coming into use as an aid to the teacher in reaching
a still wider audience.
