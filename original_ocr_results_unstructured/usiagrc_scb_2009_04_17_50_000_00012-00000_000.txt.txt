No Limits debate and praise for Cleveland Hall

No Limits Project'is valuable to the campus The No Limits Project is potentially harmful

Given the recent series of events on campus regarding discussions
between members of the No Limits Project (NLP) group and the. ad»
ministration, we must try to remember that this is a campus
that fosters open discussions and cooperation. While some
might believe that activism is the most powerful and effective
display of campus unity, care must be taken to ensure that the
actions of these acn‘visr groups truly act in the best interest of
the campus as a whole.

Many students felt betrayed by the No Limits Project and
their implication that, as they hady collected a great deal ofsig—
natures from students and faculty, they were representing the
interests of the student body As discussions and plans for ame-
liorating the discord on campus move forward, attention must be paid
to who is really the source of the desired changes.

Another matter that many individuals on campus have taken is
sue with in NLP's demands is the antagonistic and unyielding way in
which they have been presented to the administration. Grinnell is a
place where the {rec exchange ofideas amongst equals extends far be
yond the classroom While some would argue that the use of the term

“"dcmand is purclv semantics, it is hard to ignore the obvious implica-
tions of a word so combative and divisive. It doesnt feel as though
this escalatory action by an activist group on campus will mow discus—
sion forward, but will r'athcr place further pressure on already strained
smdentradministration relations.

In purely pragmatic terms, the completion of the extensive list of
“demands" directed at the administration in the desired timeframc
would be nothing short ofa massive administrative undermking.Tho
NLP posted and c-mailed their list of demands on March l3——just be-
fore the student body's departure for spring break—requesting a clearly
focused response from the administration by April 6.Thc amount of
time that goes into the budgetary accounting and evaluation of a pro-
gmm as inﬂuential as A just Grinnell is not something that can be
wedgedinto a matter of a few weeks. Despite some of our greatest
aspirations for the betterment of the College, several items on the list
are ﬁscally complicated in the current economic climate. A full, inde-
pendent tcvicw of hiring and ﬁring practices at the College' is clearly a
necessary item to be undertaken, but is not something that can be easily
created in the matter of a month, regardless of the obvious cost associ-
ated with a review of that magnitude.

This editorial is not designed to discourage campus activism. Rathr
er, it is designed to remind students involwd in groups such as the No
Limits Project that they must guard against purporting to represent
the campus as a whole. Furthermore, escalating open discussion into
Con‘llml'lvc exchanges with the administration could very likely damage
the open environment we have created on this campus.

 

In the days before spring break, the No Limits Project (NLP) pub-

lished and disseminated a list of 14 demands calling for the imple-

mentation of a number of

socirl jusn‘cerrclatcd polir

cies. More than a month

after the publication of the

14 demands, students con—

tinuc to decry NLP’s ap-

proach as counterproductive

to student agency vis-a-vis

the administration, and to

the implementation of their

own demands. We hold, however, that their dcmands encourage stu-

dent advocacy by increasing awareness and discourse about campus is
sues.

NLP’s demands include a number of long standing grievances, and
also newer issues, which have been off the radar for many students.
Since NLP attacked the merging of the Lilly Intern position with the
smounker RLC, the knowledge and discussion of rho pusiuon has in-
u'casccl on campus.Thongh a certain faction of students would have al-
ways been concerned, NLP has opened the discussion up to the broader
community by meeting this change with so much intensity, Students
who weren‘t even aware that a Lilly lntcrn exisrcd are now involved in
the discussion of whether or not the. osition should exist.This is the
open communication, rhrough [plansf over coffee and in lounges, that
students yearn for.

The choice ofthe word “demands” and the intensity of NLP’s up —
proach has been blasted as potentially inhibiting the ability of other

. students to approach administrators with ideas concerning College

policy changes However, ifanyrhing, NLP has opened other forms of
approaching administrators. Ifsrudcnts wish, they can still spt up meet-
ings with administrators about whatever and whenever, and because
of increased dialogue these approaches will likely be more valued and
wanted,

NLP indirectly encourages SGA, the administration, and other
groups directly involved in campus politics to attack the issues they
care about wir'h added fervor And any projection of Osgood, Houston
or other top administrators turning a back on students because of NLP
assumes administrators are lacking commitment to professionalism
and their position rts student advocates.

So to those who say NLP is hurting campus, look at what they have
accomplished—you're likely reading this, and likely have been talking
to senators, student affairs and others abourwhat should be done, NLP
will likely have direct success on several of its beneﬁcial issues, r1nd the
campus, as a whole, will likely have more success as well,

 

A productive response came out of the recent Cleveland Hall smoking and security issue

After receiving numerous complaints from students and scaffrcgarding the prernlcncc ofcigarette smoke in Cleveland lounge, security began

patrolling the halls of the dorm in an attempt to curb offending residents.

But officers returned to dirir regular duties this week as Cleveland Hall residents resolved to honor the smoking ban in an effort to reclaim
their dorm. Following a parricularly tumultuous week that included a visit from the Grinnell Police Department and daily monitoring from Cam-
pus Security, a handful ofsolf—guvcrning students cxprcsscd their concerns about the apparent breakdown in communication between the snrdenrs
of Cleveland and Student Affairs. Now, after a SCrlcs of all-dorm meetings, letters to the Editor in the S658, and meetings with administrators,
lines ofcommunicntion have been reestablished. Check-ins from Campus Security have sropprd, and Cleveland is effectively smoke-free, While
we’re delighted that the situation has been resolved, we remain troubled by the fact that self governance, at least at the onset, broke down.

Rather than write off administrators as impervious and generally unmceptivc of srudcnts’voicc, Cleveland residents ﬁled their grievances in
a manner that was prompt, well-articulated, and respectful of the positions of all parties involved in the conversation. Often people highlight
instances in which self—governance has failcd but rhis is a case in which selfrgovernance has prevailed.

Go make peace with the Grinnell squirrels

There's got to be something in the trees.
There's got to be somcrhing in the warcr.
There’s got to be something about the food in
thc dumpstcrs and our dorm rooms (or is it the
corn?).Thctc's got to be something different
about the nuts around campus—hccduse thc
squirrels around here are crazy.

I’m sure most ofyou have bud a rhrilling/
frighrcning squirrel

from the “Alien" movies Let me guess, it was
the former, but kind of felt like the ldllcr?

My personal Cxpcncuccs with the squirrels
have increased 420 perccnr this semesrcr be-
cause inyioom is connected to n loggia and my

Bad Sleep Cycle

on your face, sucked the living daylighrs out of

little claws. Not only that, but i am A victim
of squitrel-windowrtampcring—both of my
window screens have small holes chewed out
of them by squirrels, which is actually a come
mon sighr on Norrh Campus.

A couple of months ago, I left one of my
windows slightly open while I stepped our for
a few hours. Upon my return,l noticed rhrr
many rhings on my
desk and drasseti
both located near
my windows—were
knocked over, ins
eluding my box of
Rocher chocolates
I looked ovcr at my windowsill and noticed
ihrce golden wrappers sitting near rhc holes
on the screen. The squirrels had left a culling
card This meant win.

Okity,so even though “war"wus will“ I was
feeling at rhe time, I never hrld .my inrcnnon
ofhurring rmy squirrels (or M lensr nor any re-
r'wm .nrcntron). And to be honest, I nennlly
forgot about them for .1 while, That is, until

they srruck again.

About a month after first contact, I cracked
my window barely open (an inch max) and
lcfr my room for a couple hours. thn l gor
back, 1 opcncd my door to find a squirrel stare
ing me clown from across the room After the
initial shock, for some reason, 1 lcapr for the
little guy, nor really knowing what I would do
ifl had rcnnlly crnght it (most likely, I would
have freaked), But before I could even get to
ir, it jumped up onto the windowsill, slithered
through the tiny cm ind out through the
hole in the scrccn,Thats right, it slithcrcdi
like t sntkc.

The squirrels may be crazy, but] believewr
clin coexist wnh them These squirrel s (cvcu
rhe ones without rails) have pisr as much righr
ro be here is we do—cvcn ifrhey do prllrgc
through our cereal boxes and Seooby Snacks.

The time has come to connect with our
cuddly cohorts so this weekend, enjoy the
weather and c ‘ y hfc And on Monday, grab
some munchies and make peace with the
squirrels.
