Although Creighton has almost
identically the same team that it had
last season, when it ran away with
the Valley chninpionship, its record
so tar this season is not particularly
impressive. The Bluejays have playr
ed sir games, winning three of them,
and losing three. There is power in
Coach Scllabinger's quintet, but it
hasn‘t been unleashed as yet.

the Crinnell cagers get a two weeks'
vacation before the next game oi the

Jan 27. The Pioneers get their long-
est layoff of the season, but they will
go through their practice drills just

Clarence d. Smelser: The reading

in his work. I might add that it no
doubt will turn out to a be a sleeping
period instead of the so~called “drama

Joe llL-mderrold: It appears that

great idea, but we should rememher
that it is an experiment and should
not try to hinder it byvnot cooper-

Walt Stmley: We will have to qual-

the reading period with two ”ifs.” 1.
If there is not a too large exodus
from the Campus by the students; 2,
and if the study conditions are such
that students wishing to utilize this
time are ahle to do so, although this
period is now in the form of an ex-

make such a plan almost a necessity,
