Right SGA vote,
but attitude

overly negative

A main issue of the October 12 SGA meeting was the
question of whether or not SGA monies should be used to
fund involvement in the current attempt to preserve Blanket
Hill and, with it, the memories of the four Kent State
students murdered there. SGA voted against any such
financial assistance,

SGA discussion did not involve the question of support or
non-support for preservation of the Kent State memory.
Previous SGA meetings had already indicated strong
support of the moral issues behind current protest of the
Kent State administration's choice of site for a proposed
gymnasium,

WHAT THE MEETING’S discussion did consider was
the questionable precedent set by use of funds for a
“political" cause, as well as general student disapproval of
such use of their $65 activities fee, which might lead to legal
ramifications

Much opposition to the proposal was logically defeated by
proponents' arguments. They argued that Kent State
involvement is not political in the sense of a group with party
affiliations and platforms They noted that during the anti-
war actions of the late 60’s and 70’s SGA did provide money,
thus setting a precedent, They countered the apparent fear of
such a precedent setting off a rash of funding pleas from
small political organizations with the historical fact that the
years since the Vietnam War have not brought many
demandsl

IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT to understand that SGA
would have no obligation to fund other requests even if they
did come SGA has the right to spend money on what it
pleases and isjustified to consider requests on a case by case
basis to determine which requests are worthy and backed by
sufficient support.

Proponents of the proposal for Kent State involvement
funding also argued persuasively that funding of their ac-
tivities could he considered no more liable to legal
proceedings by dissatisfied students than the current SGA
funding of alcohol or of other small groups' activities

To BE SURE, THE proposal should have been defeated,
as it was. Knowledge of constituency opinions was too
limited for reps to have voted affirmatively and the $75 for
various expenses would have been a poor investment.

We object to the absolute refusal to spend any money
whatsoever. The following amended proposal, if it is ever
presented, should be approved: SGA will supply a minor
portion of the needed funds ($200-$300) provided that the
sixty people expressing an interest in going to Kent State
Show firm committments, that a substantial part of the non-
SGA funds be raised, and that the travellers to Kent State
officially represent Grinnell College in any way they can

THOUGH KENT STATE is a very moral issue, the
practical, financial aspects must be considered. Therefore,
representatives should present this proposal to their hall
members rather than using the general moral support for the
issue that has been expressed around campus so far as a
conclusive mandate to vote affirmatively on our proposal.

We hope hall members find the proposal appealing. It
provides an effective way to support a moral cause and it
brings more moral benefits than financial costs.

THE MAJORITY of Grinnellians support the protest
efforts at Kent State. SGA, in support of the notion that we
are liberal people who can not ignore the injustices of the
outside world, should help the effort of the people who wish
to go to Kent State to defend ourvcause.

It is possible that SGA will not meet next week. If so, we
call for a special session to be held solely for the purpose of
discussing and revoting amendments such as ours. It is the
least that can be done.

Due to lhc demands of mi semester exams, there will be no 5 s a
next week. Publication will resume Friday, November 4 ' ‘

Letters to the editor

America’s latent undertone of racism
detectable only to those exposed to it

To the editor: The hateful racism
that exism between blacks and
whites in America is well
publicized. nie undertone racism
is not as well known or publicimd.
This latent racism is hidden behind
rosy colored smiles and gleaming
white teeth. This form of racism
can only be detected by those who
are exposed to it; the feelings
experienced by these people are
the only proof if its existence.
Those feelings are evident to me,
as a black person.

Latent racism is worse thanovert
manifest racism because it in
valves deception. For example, a
person can suddenly discover that
the people he trusted and called his
friends, were never really his
friends. Specifically, this form of
racism exists in the attitudes of
whites towards blacks. American
whites have conditioned them
selves, their children, and black
people into believing that whites
are superior. No matter how much
respect the average white man

may appear to have for a black
man. he can not consider deep
down in his subconscious, that a
black man is his equal.

White like to demonstrate that
may are not racist, and then
pursue an avoidance policy. For
example, a white will approach a
black, start a friendly conversation
and really attempt to persuade him
that he's a nice friendly white. The
next day that same white will turn
eyes in the other direction when he
sees that same black walking his
way. This does not apply to the
white looking for a loken to con
stantly demonstrate to everyone
that he‘s hip, liberal and unlike the
hateful whites. Some whites are
bold enough to come right out and
tell a black that he gets along well
with blacks. It is, of Course, total
bull because if that white did have
an honest relationship with some
blacks there would be no need to
publicize it.

The average white will deny with

his dying breath that he does not
have this air of superiority. If
someone were to take a survey of
the attitudes of blacks living in
white communities and attending
white Schools, they would find
serious discontent and hostility. If
um survey were extended to
compare the attitudes of blacks
living in white environments to
those of blacks in black en
vironments, it would be found that
blacks in white environments are
more critical of whites This does
not apply to the “I‘m white" type
of black. He’s been programmed
by the whites to look down on and
reject his race.

It is unfortunate that every black
man and every white man in
America does not run out and buy
“The Autobiography of Malcom
X,” and read it with an open mind.
The book is a classic for ils graphic
description of the plight of
relations between blacks and
whites in America. Curtis Cost

Grinnell professor offended by Affirmative
Action discussion implications

To the editor: In the recent
discussion of the Affirmative
Action Program~at Grinnell
College. Bob Greenberg “ex-
pressed doubt that it will be
possible to attract minorities in
Grinnell where the minority
population is small and there is no
black studies program." The
implication of the first half of his
statement is that professors who
happen to be black will not be
attracted to an outstanding
teaching and scholarly en»
vimnment that would attract

professors who happen to be white
and male. I find the implication
personally offensive. The im-
plication of the second half of his
statement is that most professors
who happen to be black are
capable of teaching only in a
college or university that has a
black studies program. I find the
implication of this statement
equally offensive.

Grinnell doesn’t have more
blacks (or female) professors
because it was, until a few years
ago, a deliberate policy of die

senior faculty not to consider
blacks and women as viable
candidates for teaching positions.
Blacks can't teach if they are not
offered a job, Ii is as simple as
that,

Blacks do not need an Af~
_'firmative Action Program so that
they can be treated differently
than whites. Differential treatment
created the problem. Blacks just
need an environment in which they
can be treated and judged in a
similar manner as their white
peers.

Bob Greenberg can salve his
liberal guilt, if he Wishes, but
please don’t be insidious about it.

Presents
response to

recent Memo
controversy

To the editor: Iwould like to offer a
final response to the recent con-
troversy surrounding the use of the
Memo, AS the student who Sub-
mitted the item on Anita Bryant, I
would like to publicly state that the
”mild epithet” used in reference to
Ms. Bryant was the characr
terization “Orange Juice Queen." I
find it highly ironic that Mr.
Deminoff felt it necessary to delete
any reference to Ms. Bryant and
any mention that the so-called Day
for Human Rights was timed to
coincide with the Bryant concert
when just last the week the woman
was quoted as saying, “This is not
a case of human rightsl ll. is a case
of human rot!" ‘

Just who is using ”name calling”
around here any way? Patty Rose
