Team Enters

Relay Classic‘

Two Pioneer Teams Named
to Compete Saturday;
Third May Run

 

Two Grinnell relay teams, and pos-
sibly a third, will be entered in the
Drake relays at Des Moira this
weekend, Coach Les Duke announced
Tuesday. In addition Mcetcr may be
entered in the shot put, and Phciffer
may run in the open two-mils race.

The mile relay team,’ composed of
Anderson, Barnes, Bentley, and Clark,
and the distance medley team, com-
posed of McKlvecn, lMcIltath, Gor-
don, and Pheiffor are the two teams
which are certain of running.

The chances of the founmilc team,
which will run if Phciffcr does not
compete in the open two-mile event,
were considerably brightened this
week with the return of Tom Gordon
to the Squad. The founmilc team
would include, beside Cordon, Pheif-
fer, Mcllrath and either Halsey,

, Stauss or Marker.

Coach Duke said that he was well
satisfied with the showing that the
mile relay team made at the Kansas
relays, and expressed confidence that
scvcral more seconds can be clipped
from the team's fast time of three
minutes, twenty seconds, if weather
conditions are good at the Drake re-
lays.

The present Drake relay record in
the mile relay is 3:15.29, set by the
University of Iowa team in 1923. The
Indiana university team which won
the Kansas mils event last Saturday
in 3:165 will enter the Penn instead
of the Drake relays this weekend,

Brings Loop
Membership
to 8 Schools

Official Squelches Rumors
of Washington, Butler
Withdrawals

 

Tulsa university of Tulsa, Okla,
and Washburn college of Topeka,
Kan, have been admitted as members
of the Missouri Valley conference, E.
D, Strong, secretary of the circuit,
stated yesterday.

Since both of new members, as
well as the remaining schools in the
Conference, have already completed
their football Schedules for the comr
ing fall, neither will enter valley
grid competition until 1935. Tulsa
has been invited to enter a team in
the conference track meet in Des
Moines on May 19, but as yet it has
not signified whethcr or not it will
send any representatives, Both schools
will; compctc in Valley basketball
during the 1934—35 season.

Consider Rule Change

According to Mr. Strong, no
changes in the conference elibility
rules were necessary to provide for
Tulsa's cntrsncc since that school
nbnndonncd some years ago its for-
mer policy of allowing freshman
participation in varsity sports, The
conference committee has, however,
been considering a slight change in
cligibility regulations to allow trans-
fers from junior colleges to enter
immediately into varsity competition.
At the present such students can
participate only in frcshman ath-
letics.

The addition of washburn and
Tulsa brings the conference member-
ship to eight teams. Before the with-
drawal of the Big Six from the val-
ley there were ten teams in the loop.
Following the withdrawal of these
schools, Creighton was at once ad-
mitted, and Butler began competing
in the conference during the basket—
ball scason of 193233.

No withdrawals Imminent

Coe had previously been asked to
enter the league but did not desire
to give up its position in the Mid;
West conference. _

Washington and Butler have made
no move to withdraw from conference
competition as has been suggested
by some sport writers. Mr. Strong
asserted.

The location of both Tulsa and
Washbum will make it possible for
Grinncll. Drake, and the Butler cage
teams to make a southern trip which
will include games with both of the
former schools and the Oklahoma
Aggies, This situation will make it
unnecessary for these teams to play
the same school on successive nights
as they have frequently had to do in
recent years for financial reasons.

 

Campus Election Awaits
Tally on First Ballot

 

The ballots cast Monday evening
on the new Student Council consti-
tution have not yet been counted,
Mark Trumbull, council member
under whose direction the election
was conducted, announced today.

No action will be taken toward
scheduling a primary election to
vote on candidates for council posts
until the result of the aforementioned
vote has been ascertained, Trumbull
asserted,

At the time when the primaries
are held, the election will be c0n<
ducted in accordance with the rules
of the reorganized constitution, with
the entire student body eligible to
cast ballots.

Members of the old council plan to
meet this evening to nominate can—
didates for membership on the recre-
ation committee and for auditor.
Three candidates will be Selected for
each of the positions. The officers
for these positions will be decided
in the final election, which will
likely be held next Week.
