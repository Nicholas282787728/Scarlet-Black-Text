Convo series lacks consistent quality

by lat/Io Jackson

Helena Percas de Ponseti's convocas
tion speech on November 29 marked
the end of this semester's Scholars’
Convocation Series, This first effort to
organize a weekly all-campus lecture
period has been described as “full of
potential,”

Director of College Relations
William Deminoff commented, “The
quality (of the speakers) was not in all
cases as I would want it. but assuredly
most of the lecturers were excellent. I
certainly would say that the faculty
speakers were among the highest in
quality." Deminoff has been responsi-
ble for scheduling the speakers' visits.

Students and taculty who had been
to several of the lectures concurred on
the question of speaker quality,
strongly urging that greater care be
taken in their selection, The main pro-
blem with the series, they said. was

that the audience walked into Herrick
Chapel not knowing whether their 50
minutes would be well-spent. The
uneven quality of the speakers may
have caused fewer of the student body
to regularly attend the series.

Despite this problem, attendance
was fairly good. Students comprised
roughly half of the audience. which
usually filled Herrick comfortably.
Professor Jack Worley pointed out
that if a maximum or only 200
studeanione-sixth of the college—- ’
went to the lectures, the kind of in-
tellectual discourse they were intend»
ed to spark could hardly be achieved.

Professor Ronald Kurtz, chairman
of the faculty, agreed that the pro
gram would be more effective it more
students could attend. He thought the
time of the lectures. 11:00 am. work»
ed better than evenings in terms of at
tendance.

“I support the Scholars' Convocation
program because we're likely to get
the generation of intellectual inter-
change among students and faculty on
a broader sense this way than with
specialized speakers within depart-
ments," said Kurtz. '

Kurtz‘s statement summarized the
general reaction to the program.
Several students said they enjoyed the
chance to learn a little about a subject
they might not want to pursue in an
entire course. James Redlield and
Howard Burkle were cited as two of
the most interesting speakers,

The Séholars' Convocation Series
will begin next semester with a lece
ture on us. foreign policy to be
delivered February 7. Later in the
month, economist and presidential
candidate Barry Commoner will
speak. '

decreasing use of the lacility, much of
the equipment has become scattered
around campus and the studio has

Presently, a problem exists with ﬁle
availability of the video equipment,
Verrette indicated that the video
studio is being moved to ARI-l 123, but
he was unclear when the equipment
and studio would be in working order
again. Verrete pointed out that the
problem stems from the placement oi
the original studio. The PEC is in a
very diswnt location from central
campus and there have been many
transportation problems in moving
equipment by 5&6 trucks. Conse-
quently, many sensitive pieces of
equipment have been damaged and
mistreated.

At the Language Lab in ARH, many
boxes of Video tape are sitting on the
floor. Additionally, cameras and
monitors are not properly broken
down and stored correctly. Some of
the camera lenses are missing. Ver-
rette says many cameras have been
damaged. Much or the equipment
needs to be sorted and repaired, but
Verrette hopes to have some of it in
good working order by the end of
January.

Verl-ette indicated he is unsure of
the need for the video studio, but he
pointed out that the iacility has great
