til ELECTIONS

As the current so ics of elections runs ts course, there
arises the, annual sugges ions for the illlprovemcnt of
the electorial system and cos for the more efficient see
leceion of candidates for positions of student leadership

Most pel illcnt of these to our mind is the suggestion
that the order of election of house presidents and president
of the Student Council be reversed. in the past, with not-
able exceptions, including this year, the polic of electing
the president of the Student Council oftcr the election of the
house presidents has tended to place a sixth or seventh rank '
mall in the position with consequent loss of prestige, as a
man who didn‘t make house president.

There is no intention on our part of detracting from
or being derogatory to the office of house president. We
do think it is self evident that the office of president of the
Student Council, which affects d ectly so many more sin»
dents alld functions, ranks higher in impor once.

The conclusion is obvious , If the election of the stu‘
dent Council president should be held first, the best man on
the campus would be chosen for the office. Positions on
the Council of House Presidents would then fall to the
leaders of the halls, who are usually leaders on the campus,
on the basis of their leadership ill the house

AWAY Olll G

The inadequateliess of the present single entrance to tilt
college book store has for several years been growing more
and more obvious Yet, each year, the same condition is
allowed to exist despite protests from all who make use of
the store.

We realize that this is a situation which may not be
alleviated with ease or without considerable expense; yet,
we are equally conscious of the fact that something will
have to be done about the situation ill time.

Purely aside from the collvclliencc factor involved, there
are those of safety, elimination of confusion in the library,
and cutting down the walking on the lawn in front of the
library, which would be gained by an addition to the en»
trances and exits to the store,

Several suggestions have been. advanced for doing this.
Of course, the cheapest, but not the best, is the proposal to
cut another basement entrance through from the back of
the library, though we believe not enough people would
go around in back to eliminate the crowding.

More expensive, but of much more real value would
be the cutting of a licw stairway from the loggia connect
ing the Alumni Recitation hall and the library to the book
store This would eliminate walking through the library to
reach the book store and would leave the outside entrance
free for those coming from outside.

A GOOD DISPOSITION G

(REPRINTED FROM THE DAILY O’COLLEGIAN)

What does a person get by a frown '1 Not much more
than a frown in return. It is eternally true that a person‘s
mental attitude has a great deal to do with the way he gets
along ill this world and everything to do with the way he
gets along with himself. People who lapse into sullen
moods invite poor health, which in turn invites more sullen
moods,

Cultivate a good attitude. A person will draw friends
if he is cheerful and willing even if he isn‘t the most in-
telligent or interesting fellow.

Benton’s Art
Gets Zip from
Own Emotions

ly Hem-y Aldon

It is particularly appropriate
that a pfllntillg by Thomas Hart
Benton should now be on exlllhit
in the co idol- of Mam hall, for
Benton i one of the three Amerr
can painters today who most clo-
qilcntiy represent the middle west
in art. Throughout the United
States the name of Benton means
Missouri, Just as John Steuart
Curry stands for Kansas and
Grant Wood for Iowa.

The two paintings by Grant
Wood exhlhitcd iii the quatllangle
last year gave one as clear an
idea of his style as so small a se-
lcction could be expected to of~
fe This year we have the op-
portunity of Judging Bcnton's

from a single highly typical
canvt, entitled “Coke Plant."

The contrast in their manner
is obvious. . one ivno still re-
calls Gi-nnt Wood's lush green
and bl'oll'n landscapes that looked
almost as if they were made of
painted wooden blocks will be
immediately impressed by the
fluidity of Benton’s lines in this
. ture in which even the solid
outlines of a locomotive and some
wooden buildings achieve a sinu—
oils writhing effect that is sharp
ly dramatic Too, the neutral
tones have a lurid, sinister qual-
ity that is in direct contrast with
the peaceful, happy colors of the
characteristic Grant Wood scene.

Both the composition and the
color of "Coke Plant" are not-
able, but what is especially re-
markabic is the fact that the art-
ist has succeeded in putting a
great deal of personal emotional
quality into what might have
been just another painting of the
American industrial scene The
picture arouses a desire to see
and compare a number a! his
canvases, but perhaps the p
we is all the keener because it is
concentrated here in a single
ample of his work.

For.ilrose who are interested
in learning more about his work,
Thomas Hart Benton's recent au-
tobiography, “An Artist in Amer-
ica," is on display in the Flor-
enc‘c Lewis library, where they
may enjoy the many illustrations
of Mis. sslppi river life, of Ozark
hillbiihcs, and of iudustralAmcr-
iea with which Benton has cmr
bellisbcd the life story of air ans
thentic lnidwcstclu Amcricnu
