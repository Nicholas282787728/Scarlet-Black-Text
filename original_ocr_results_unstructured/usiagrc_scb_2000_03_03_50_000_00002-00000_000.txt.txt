She also asked srudcnrs to sign two perie
riorrs, one demanding mandatory sexual as-
sault trai ng for all students, and another
demanding mandatory rrnining for sports
teams. “It’s not enough to have ‘\Vhen hello
gers our or hand your freshman year,"
anbrough said. “Rape does not go away.
Rape does not disappear."

Fambrough rhen read a list of ways in
which she said Student Affairs staffhad VIO‘
lneed Grinncll’ssexual assault policy over the
last four years. She sard that while the Cole
logo is supposed to help collect evidence in
sexual assault cases, some
victim: had been asked to
collect lhclr own evi—
dence. Additionally, she
said, the rrial process
once a complaint is riled
can tolee up to rhrce times
as long as it is supposed
to.

Fambmugh said that

took so long to come forward, and advised
them “to talk with their mplst to make them
feel better."

Furthermore “rapists can be acquitted
even when rhey ndrnir ro borh parties being
drunk," Fambrough said.

“I don't feel safe on this campus," said

Deans ofStudent Affairs Jennifer Krohn,

in attendance, along with Assistant Dean

“There are a number orpcople srudenrs

ing the college chaplains, the health center
staff, and Director of Communiry service
Amy Ellcrr, among orhers.

Then, rhe person rhe complainr is being is»

no less rhnn 48 hours after rhar,

Krohn said that there is often a delay
because the college calls in an outside hear
ing board assistanr ro invesrigare sexual as-
sault cases. The assistant interviews borh
parties and any witnesses lrsrcd, and gives rhar
information to rhe hearing board.

Kmhn said rhar a hearing “ideally would
happen sooner rhan ir has been happening."
bur the delay is orren due ro circumstances
such as the availabiliryorrhe investigatornnd

“This ropie is an imporrnrrr topic io marry
people on this campus,” Krohn said. she
added that student Affairs had been seeking
srudenrs to join a sexual assault rasle rorce,
bur received only three applicarions. “Stun
denrs can and should have input into rhe
process," Krolm said.

“There is also considerable concern about
how students are judged by the student com»
muniry outside rhe judlcml process," said
Krohn. “Saying‘rnpisrs have been acquirred
rhrough rhe judicial process is saying rhar
they are already judged a rapist... rhe hear»
mg board licnrs borh sides orrhe case. Out-
side ofrhchearing board, people don't know

Kmhn also said rhai rht college believes
