As the 1995-96 season drew to a
close for the Grinnell College women’s
swim team at last weekend’s Midwest
Conferencc meet, that: was some doulit

ending to the story. The team bus lsrokc

Meet the tennis team here and

Aftetzl long off-season ofptepa-
ration, the Grinnell College men’s
tennis team is once again poised to
take to the courts. With first—year
coach Andy Hamilton at the helm,
the Pioneers start the season this
Saturday by hosting a triangular
against Cornell and Lows. The
matches with Cornell begin at
8:303m. and the Lotus contests com-
mence at 3:00pm.

Grinnell will be hard—pressed to
improve upon last season in which
the Pioneers ﬁnished fourth in the
Midwest Conference with an 8-5
record in dual meets. Three of the
startingsixsinglespositionsfromthat
team were lost to graduation, includ—
ing 1995 MVP Jeff Lahri. Also, the
team faces a tough schedule with
matches against regionally ranked
foes such as Coe and Ripon. But

S[|ll lip in the air, but it should be
solid as well. “Because we have so
many playcrs vying for a position, I
anticipate the competition to be
fierce for that spot," said Hamilton.

ln this week’s triangular the Pi.
onccrs hope to start off their season
with a hang. Grinnell defeated both
Cornell and Lotus last season, but
Hamilton is not overconfident “I
am grateful to have three Juniors
returning, but I am also anXIous to
see what the newer player can do."
commented Hamilton. With the
lofty goals offinishing in the top {out

dual meets, a good performance
against Cornell and Loms would
give a huge initial boost to the team.

chance to meet their objectives.
