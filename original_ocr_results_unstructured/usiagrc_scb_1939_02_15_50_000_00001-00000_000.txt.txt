With a Liberal?

Twentyrthree years of service on
the nation‘s highest judicial body
is a record of which any man
might well be proud. This is the
record of Louis Dembitz Brandeis,
one of the now famous nine old
men Who, in spite of his years.
continued to command the respcct
of his associates, friend and fee
alike, to the end of his term.
Justice Brandeis, lost Monday
took advantage of the fullmay
retirement plan for justices of
the United states supreme
court, Brandeis got what might
be termed an honorable dis—
chorge. for although he was the
object of scorn mid bitter crit—
icism during his first years on
the bench, he retired as a be-
loved and esteemed justice.

The retirement of Justice Bran-
deis marks the latest of several
opportunities given President
Roosevelt to influence the com-
position of the court. His action
toward the court in ~the past has
been one of the points on which
he has taken the most criticism.
though his last appointment, of
Felix Frankfurter, has met with
general approval.

it is interesting to speculate
as to whether the President, at
the time be appointed I‘d-ank—
furtcr, already knew he would
soon have another selection to
make. Brandeis’ retirement,
coming so soon after the Har-
vnrd professor's appoint-merit,
points to such a conclusion, and
perhaps explains the President‘s
failure to appoint a western
man in the former m.

Brandeis’ recent resignation is
of especial interest to people in
this part of the country, because
one of the men being prominently
mentioned for his place on the
bench is Dean Wiley Rutledge of
the University of Iowa School of
Law. Dean Rutledge, it is rumor-
ed, refused a chance for consider-
ation after the death of Justice
Cardozo. by expressing his sym-
pathy for Frankfurter‘s appoint-
merit, He seems well»quahfied for
the position, and is favored by
New Dealers because of his known
liberal tendencies.

The consideration of Dean
Rutledge as successor to Bran-

deis brings up the question of
the advisability of appointing
another Libel-ill justice to the
bench at this time. It is true
that the retirement of Justice
Brandeis leaves only four con-
firmed liberals on the Court,
but there are one or two oth—
ers who vote liberal in the ma-
jority of cases
There is the added Considerae
tion that the appointment of a
more conservative justice would
help to appease many of the more
rightrwing Democrats who have
strayed from the fold. A problem
definitely faces Roosevelt on this
question. At any rate, it will be
interesting to observe his next
nomination to the supreme bench.

STUDENT RECI'l‘AL FRIDAY

the party was a “Dictators Ball.“
