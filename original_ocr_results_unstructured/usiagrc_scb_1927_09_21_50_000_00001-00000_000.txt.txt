Nearly Forty First Year Gridmen
Report to Manager Snavely
For Equipment.

HAVE NUMEROUS LINEMEN

Rudimentary Drill Reveals Wor-
thy Fees to Buck Varsity Men
In Scrimmage.

The class of 1931 bids fair to he one
of the best athletic classes in recent
years according to examination of the
roll call. With the reporting of a
record breaking squad for fresh foot-
baii last night, and with evidence of
stellar performers along other lines
as Well ,the above assumption appears
to be not far from wrong.

Freshman gridders to the number of
nearly forty applied to manager
Snavely for equipment, and with more
coming every day, the squad should
reach half a hundred before the week
is up. Director of Athletics John c.
Truesdale will assume the duties of
freshman coach, and may be assisted
by Clark Morris, several years ago a
member of the strong Grinnell elevens.

More linemen Than hacks.

Line candidates seemed to out num-

bet the backfield aspirants by quite ii ‘

number in the initial practice last
evening. The men were all put
through several rudimentary drills
which would enable the coaches to get
a fair conception of the players' abil—
ﬂies. The final selection of members
for the first frosh eleven generally re.
mains a secret until a few minutes be—
fore each practice with the varsity.
The freshmen will come in for several
stiff sessions against the upper-class—
men, and from indications Will be
a worthy foe for their more exper—
llenced opponents.

Humphrey, and Minier, Moline, [1].,
are a pair of tackles who look like
mighty promising material. Both are
in the neighborhood of six feet, and
do the scales a little less the much-
sought-for 180 pounds. Both of these
men played fins games of both foot-
ball and basketball when in prep
school, being considered among ’the
most powerful performers in both
sports in the Trl—Clty clrcles.

Douglas 1s Promising.

Douglas, Cedar Rapids, is a football
player of ability, and in addition is a
high jumper in track, and a. center in
basketball. In the last state high
school meet, Douglas placed second in
the jumping event.

Wheeler, .1 protege of Don parker,
’18. at Mitchell, 5. D.. is a fine football
player, having performed at fullback
on the South Dakota school's team for
several years. Weighing 180 pounds.
Wheeler looks every inch a football
player.

Ferguson of Tamil, Weitrich of
Stuart, Alex of Davenport, Ekwitll,
Des Moines, Hakendorf, Davenport,
Koger of Newburg, and Postom of
Council Bluffs, fire all players who
made remarkable records While in
high school, and may add to their
laurels in Grinucll on the gridiron.
Soesby, a transfer from State (cachz
cars is a fine lineman.

Basket Tossors Plcutiful.

The basketball court has not been
slighted in the least with Humphrey
and ilinier from the Illinois city,
Grange, WeSthlterloo, a. Classy basket
lesser who competed with the \Vest
team in the National tournament ser
ernl years ago. Peterson, another man
developed by Parker in Mitchell, is (I
second semester mfln who plays a fine
court game, and also Shines on the
Cinders.

Leading the track performers will
be Eszlll, lengthy shot star from Des
Moines, who was unofficially credited
with several heave: over the fifty font
mark: Alex, one of the fastest prcp
sprinters in the State during the last
several years, and Douglas, a. fine
jumper. In addition to these men there
are numberleSS others who have made
outstanding marks While in high
school, and Who will report for the
cinder sport to Coach Duke in the
spring.

Freshmen Organize Class and Hear
Regulations of Campus Government

The first year men and women were
kept busy yesterday organizing their
class and learning about the governs
ment of both sides of the campus.

The official existence of the class
of 1.031 began with an election of are
ficers in the Alumni Recitation hall
auditorium Tuesday Afternoon. Dwight
Smiley will lead the freshmen through
the first semester as president; Elear
nol' King will assume the duties of
lice-president; Louis Egan was elect-
ed secretary; Jane Evenson, girls'
treasurer; and Douglas Hayes, men’s
treasurer.

Committees, including the important
social committee, will be selected at
a meeting to he held the last of the
week.

A meeting of the freshman girls was
held in the quadrangle Theatre Tues-

dny morning at 10:30. The traditions
of Griuncll were explained and the
rules of the Women's Self Goyernr
merit League read and discussed.
Sallye Bolldinot, president of tho Lea-
gue Board was in charge of the meets
ing. , .

At a meeting of frosh men Tuesday
morning in the A, R. H. auditorium
representatives of the men's govern-
ment acquainted the new men with
the college rules and regulations.

Ralph Bal'i'is spoke for the Men’s
Court and ehplained the duties of that
body. Paul Smiley explained in a slur
ilar way the function of the Men's
Senate.

The new men were given copies of
the regulations and Dean .1. F. Findlay
spoke to them regarding general regs
ulations on the campus.

 

OPENING DANCE LAST NIGHT.

The Mississippi six played for the
opening college dance in the Men's
gymnasium last night. A large crowd
attended the dance. the majority be-
ing upperclassmen.

1927 Grid Rules , .
Change the Game

Goal Posts Moved; Passing Rule
Altered: Stops Required on
Shift Plays.

Spectators at the Penn game will
perhaps find themselves somewhat
bewildered unless they become fam-
iliar with several of the new and rad-
ical changes which have been made in
the football rules. These new rules
tend to speed up the game and as well
to clarify some of the old rules which
have caused confusion in past sea-
sons. -Some of the new rules follow
in brief:

The goal posts shall now be ten
yards back from the end of the play~
lng field and they shall be within the
end zone. The rule tends to eliminate
the danger to men on the field when
engaged in rushing plays near the
goal line. The try for point is also
made more difficult by this ruling, be-
cause the distance to be klcked is ten
yards farther. Field goals bear the
same handicap also.

Players May Return.

Players who have been withdrawn
from the game during the first or sec—
ond periods may return to the game
during the second half. However, a
penalty is imposed when a player fails
to report to the referee after said
player has once been In the lineup and
been withdrawn from play. This in-
cludes any player starting the third
period of a. game after having been
withdrawn’ during the first and second
periods.

The hall is dead on all backward
passes (other than the one from the
center) when the pass is not complete.
Heretofore the ball was a free ball
when such a backward pass was
thrown. The offensive side must have
complete possession of the hall on
such a play before the defensive side
can get possession on a fumble.

Safety T0 Tvllclllliick.

When the ball i, kicked over the
goalvline on the kickoff and in posses»
slun of a player defending the goal, it

- a touchbeck. The rules before
gave the offensive team a safety on
this play and two points, The old
rules also called for a new kickoff.

in rill shilt plays the players must
come ‘0 an absolute stop and remain
stiltionlll‘y for the period of aproxi-
matcly one second,

Either team may call for time out
but three times. The old rule ullouu
ed each team four opportunities for
time out other than for injuries. This
new rule will speed the game up sew
oral minutes at least, and will do away
with useless stalling for time during
the closing minutes of play. Another
supplementary to this rule is one
which forbids a team to substitute
during the last two minutes of the
game unless in case of injury to a
player, under penalty.

NOTICE!

To all sopllolllores, juniors and son-
iors.

Tryouts for the llrurnutic club play
to lie given at Homecoming will be

Story In Tanager
Stirs Radio Fans

Barnes‘ Article on KFNF Arouses
Much Comment; Prominent
Authors Contribute.

"Culture Waves from KFNF" by
Thorncll names, ‘30, a resident of
Shenandoah, printed in the September
issue of the Tanager, Grlnnell literary
magazine, has stirred up more public
comment than any article printed in
previous numbers of the magazine.

Many papers, including the New
York Times, the Omaha World»Herald
and the Des Moines Register, have gi-
ven a great deal of space to the article
and Henry Field's objections to it. The
editors, the author and President Main
have received numerous anonymous
and signed letters from radio fans de-
nouncing and praising the Tanager ar-
ticlc and the magazine. The president
of the Iowa Radio Listeners' League
promised the college his support in
case any action were taken, but Mr.
Field was finally silenced by the
threat of losing his broadcasting li-
cense.

The article is purely expository,
though written in a slightly satir tic
vein, it includes much conversation
and very few opinionated remarks.

“its New Cover.

The new cover arrangement of the
Tanager, with the elimination of the
border and tlic‘ printing of titles on the
outside cover, has also been the sub
ject of favorable comment, besides the
general contents of the magazine.

A number of prominent authors are
included in September’s contributors,
Felix Morley, who has the leading .
ticle, “China's Revolution." has recent—
ly visited Japan, China, and the Pllir
lippinos as a correspondent for the
Baltimore Sun and is author of “Our
Far Eastern Assignment." l-fe pre-
sents the Chinese situation competent

Edwin T. Meredith, editor of Sllc~
ccssful Farming and secretary of ag-
riculturc in the cabinet of Pro dcnt
Wilson, contributes "What the Former
Needs." In a somewhat involved style,
he presents his proposal for a govern-
ment commission to . st in putting
agriculture on n husinenss basis.

Morcluml Writes.

John If. Moreladd, author of “Red
Poppies in the When " and former edi-
tor of the Lyric, writes "Jericho," a
poem after the manner of a negro
spiritual. Jay G, Sigmund, frequent
contributor to the Tanager and whose
recent book is reviewed in the issue,

Oskaloosa Team Reputed To Have

LOCAL LINEUP UNGERTALN

Grinnell Has Disadvantage of Few
Days Practice Compared to
Penn’s Month Drill,

Playing a team reputed by Penn
fans to be the best that college has
ever had. the local squad will face a
test Saturday which should truly ins
dicate its strength or weakness. “Sev-
en points difference" seems to he the
comparative strengths of the two
teams, according to sports authorities.
But which team will have the extra
touchdown at the final whistle seems
to be a question which only the game
can answer.

Hard scrimmage and driving wurke
outs have failed to disclose any glar-
ing weaknesses in the team which
faces Penn this week. An hour or
better of “knock down and drag out"
scrimmage Monday evening followed
by more than a half hour of the same
medicine Tuesday revealed unexpect-
ed power which may carry Grinnell to
a far better season than dopesters
have predicted.

Visitirn Experience

Penn lines up for the initial kick»
off with eight lettermen and the cream
of the freshman material that school
has claimed in years, The suuad has
been conditioning for more than four
weeks and promises to show mid-
season form in its first some.

The Watt~men start the Penn battlc
with only seven days of training. Alr
though these days have been filled
with intensive drill, the Grlnnell brand
of football must be ragged at best. If
she wins it will he by other means
than the machine-like work of late fall
San-Les.

coach Watt has tried several come
blnatlous in his efforts to find what
set of players carry the ball farthest
and present the nearest to a stone wall
defence. Although he has issued no
statements as to the men who begin
the opening contest, be has shown dis-
tinct favor to a line composed of
Bradley center. Cleland and Parish at
guards, Captain Davis and ifiinefelt-
er tackles and Fall and Briggs ends.
For his backfield, "FIIZZ" watt most
often plays Leidtke and Evahn at
halves, Rose at full and Mcintyre
Quarter.

Shift Combinations.

Watt has injected numerous other
players into this lineup both to ob-
serve their effect on his first combin—
ation and to accustom them to its
style of play. Macy and Fierce have
received the backfield call most.

Many Stage Stars

F'rosll Inaugurate New “Stunts”
In Varied Program of
Entertainment.

Innugllrating something new for
"stunts" during freshman week, the
class of 1931 presented a varied pro»
gram of song, dance and drama. under
the direction of the freshman group
advisers Monday night in A. R. H.
auditorium.

The program began with a one act
play, “Rehearsal," which was present-
ed by a cast composed of girls. Action
centered around it doddexing old fath-
er Llf Irish nationality upon Whom a
great shame had been brought, True
to life, rehearsal degenerated into a
series of pally quarrels and catty re-
marks. Those taking part were Milt

Tanager.

One of the many letters sent to
Barnes is reprinted:

Griunell College,

The most low down dirty trick (not

As for Mr. Fields \isitors being

body else to clean) but that is culture,
isn't it?

Ask some of your college smart

So Barnes cherishes the relics of
the hectic days when he was a trl—
state martyr to radio development.
