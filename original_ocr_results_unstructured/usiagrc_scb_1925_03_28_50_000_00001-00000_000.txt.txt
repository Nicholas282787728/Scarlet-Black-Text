AN EXPENSIVE PRODUCTION

Costumes Have Been Obtained
From Proios‘sionuls.

The special performance of “Romeo
and Juliet“ which was given last night
for the children of the city schools was
well received, and testified to the high
qual' ~ of this evening‘s performance,
which is open to the general public.

The Dramatic club’s production of

1 the famous Shakespearean tragedy of
youth is without doubt the most 913.1»

,orate and beautiful spectacle the club
has attempted in many years. The
costumes, which were used in profes-
sional productions are most striking,
and the sets, which have been built by
special corps of workers, are of unus-
usal beauty or torn: and color.

The play consists of fifteen scenes
with nine changes of scenery. The
settings are largely impressionistic,
giving large opportunity for the play
of imay‘nation, and vary in represen-
tation from the banquet hall of a nob-
leman's palace to the cell of a medi-
eval monk, and from a street in Ver7

Irving H. Hart, a graduate of Grin-

valuable service in preparing reading
information in two articles entitled
"The Hundred Bcst Sellers for the

(By Frances Fetter-man)

The "Russian Toy Shop” arranged
by Chalir, which was presented Fri-
day night as part of the annual deni7
onstration of the women's physical
training department, from the stand-
point of pure charm, was one of the
most appealing spectacles Griuuell has
witnessed for some time. The color—
ful simplicity of the scene and the
lack of affectation in in the dancing
were refreshing.

The sunny, unsophisticated manner
in which the whole ballet was given,
awakened child-like appreciation in
the audience. Throughout. one's im7
agination was continually called up—
on.

The back drop for "The Russian Toy
Shop, of the impressionistic type, de-
signed hy Grace Grant, succeeded in
creating an atmosphere which it is
hard to achieve in a bare gymnasium

The most skillful bit of the ballet

oueee house. All the changes are
made in a reuiarkabl, ,'liort time, and
the orchestral interludes serve to
heighten the color of the whole pr
duction. A

The lighting effects, worked out by
Howard Wicks and a corps of assi37
tants are most pleasing. From the
sunrises and sunsets over the sea,
with the shining walls of the city in
the distance, to the cold septilohrai
light in the priests cell and in the
Calupet tomb, Mr. Wicks has made
the most at the elaborate lighting re-
sources at his disposal.

A great deal of scenic material has
been purchased by the club for this
production, in addition to several new
spots and flood lights, making it, with
the elaborate costumes and incident
sis. an unusually expensive wpl‘odllc—
tion. For this reason it is hoped that
the large auditorium ot the High
School building may be well filled for
tonight's performance. The seat
sale has been golug‘well today, but
many choice places will he available
at the door tonight.

The lobby of the auditorium has
been luxuriously furnished for the
comfort of the patrons of the play,
and college girls, costumed as me—
dieval pages, will officiate as ushers.
An air of the medieval pervades the
place, heightening the romantic ntllios7

The Maltese cross scored its first
point this year when Gordon Kitchen
placed fourth in the special 30:) yard
race at the lllinois relays, He was
the only Grinnell man to count in the

team was crippled by the absence of

the sick list anti the latter being in-

markably viVacious child. Eotli Adele
Schwartz, as the very positive mother,
and‘nuth Somers, as the father to
whom only the child could appeal did
effective work.

Ruth Gordon. the Bluebird, who did
a solo dance, and led the ensemble at
the close, was a spirited figure. The
two fairy dolls, who could not be sep—
arated, were gracefully interpreted by
Muriel Ratclitte and Alice Spaulding.
These three danceis e -hibited thebest
control and training.

All of the dances, however, though
simple, had an unaffected convincing-
ness, because throughout the entire
ballet the members threw themselves ,
into their parts whole-heartedly.

The costumes, some of them say
and exotic and-others of dainty beau7
ty, were all well executed. The garb
of the Russian dolls, including the
Misses Barton, Osher, Knox, McCor-
nack, Taylor, Meanster, Pitcher and
Wilson, made them hewitchingly
quaint. Doroth , Lynch‘s costnn'ie made
her a realistic broom. Little‘ Jeanne
Ryan, daughter of Prof and iii . J. H.
Ryan was a clever mite of a rabbit.

Too numerous to mention, but all
effectively done were the froliosome
character dances.

Part I of the'demonstratiou, includ<
ling exhibitions of the various classes,

cujoyseeiug the showing off ofpllpils’
work to fond parents and friends. The
drills were all very ordinary, though
pel‘lorllled with proficiency and dex—
terity that told of careful training.
Miss Clara J. Andersen and Miss
Hal ictt Kuglin, her assistant, de-
serve a great deal of credit tor” the
success of the demonstration. Doual—
dine Glass assisted in the production
by training the lndian club drill of the
sophomoic drill class.
