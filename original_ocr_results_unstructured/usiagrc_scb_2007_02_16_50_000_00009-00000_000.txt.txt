Boo to no booing, offensive cheers

Last Saturday, in aloud, energetic Darby
Gym, Lake Forest men's basketball coach
Chris Conger earned two
technical fouls and an ejec-
tion from the game,a rarity
in Division III basketball.
He then approached the
Gtinnell College student
section, giving them two
thumbs up and verbal
compliments that seemed
dcrisive. Conger’s ejection was the latest ex»
ample of the highestress atmosphere created
by Pioneer basketball fans that gives Grinnell
a homercourt advantage unrivaled by other
MWC teams.

But sometimes the fans go too far in siipr
port of the home team. Last baseball season,
student conduct caused coachTim Hollibaugh
to come out ofthe dugout towarn them against
making vulgar and insulting comments. Hole
libaugh’s actions were likely in response to a
profane and homophobic chant. This season,
security guards at basketball games have often
warned fans about negative and vulgar chilnit
ing, and there have been some fan ejections.

These actions show an emphasis on posir

ink that to

tive cheering that' is coming from the highest
levels of the NCAA down through athletic dc-
partmeiits nationwide. The
NCAA Toolkit on Spotter
manship advises school ore
ficirils to “encourage fans to
root for theii team and not
against their opponent."

But the gate may have
swung too far in the other
direction. Grinnell baskets
hall tans are being told they cannot boo the
opposing team, and the result is an awkwaid
silence when the oppos-
ing ream rakes the court,
among other times.

The problem with the
no booing rule is that it as-
sumes booing is vulgar and
insulting. It is not, It is a
tradition that is more tongue-in-cheek than
heartfelt: in the theatrical production that is a
home sporting event, the visiting team is the
villain, Fans boo the characters, not the actors.
Boeing is a practice in competitive camara-
derie, and frustrating fans by taking away ti
harmless tradition is only going to anger them

and foster antagonism between fans, the ad-
ministratioii and security.

Fans are also being told that they are not
allowed to speak to opposing players and
coaches and are not allowed to recite names or
jersey numbers. Does this include the harmless
“Number six, your shoe is untied!" ptilnk? Is
the popular “sweater vest" chant {or fashion-
challenged coaches now grounds {or ejecting
fans from the stands.> we hope not. Vulgarity
and personal insults do not belong anywhere
in rhe stands, but overly strict tan conduct
rules threaten to take the competitive play-

fulness and Fun out of the
student section's interaction

The prob/em with the no booing with the game.
rule is that it assumes booing i5
Vii/got and insulting his not.

The administration
should allow booing and
let fans participate in other
harmless jocnlarity of fair
opponent interaction. Likewise, Grinnell fans
should refrain from radgariry and malicious
personal attacks. A good home crowd is loud,
witty and energetic. Ideally, no one should
leave home games with ill tedings or disre-
spect towards or from the opposing team. We
teel like that's a goal everyone can shoot for.

 

Education not enough: take action
n global warming issues now

The staff editorial in the 5GB last week
addressed global warming. we commend the
$81? for addressing this issue, however we were
very disappointed in the passive voice it used
when “urging" students to actually act on this
causc.Thc editolinl suggested “learning" about
the complexities otglobnl warming and acting
in response, Learning about global warming is
essential, However, being passive is not an op-
tioii if we hope to survive as a species.

Global warming is caused by greenhouse
gases which get trapped in the atmoiphcie and
cause the planet to warm. According to the
intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(lPCC), rhcrc is a greater than 90 percent
chance that humans are the primary cause of
rising global temperanucs.

The et‘fccrs orglobil warming are showing
and cannot go ignored The polar ice caps are
melting, resulting in rising in sci levels, which
will flood low~lying areas and will displace
millions of people. This is a humanitarian tlir
saster waiting to happen. as an increased level
of malaria and other diseases can be expected
to accompany this.

All of the cnvironmcntal enctrs or global
warming warrant a change; however rhc fact
that the world's oil resources are depleting
provides even greatei motivation to rum to-
ward renewable and cleaner energy. organism

tions and people on campus are trying to bring
this pressing issue to the attention of the stu-
dent body and the administration, Last spring,
EcoCampiis, A committee of faculty, staff and
students, implemented set-points in all campus
buildings to regulate temperature. Continued
pressure from the student body. statraud tie
ulty is needed for these changes to continue.

Rather than manipulating our policies to
be compatible with peer instinitions, Grinncll
can he the leader in terms otour energy cone
suniprion and greeirmindetlncsa, Iowa has
winch Grinuell College should take advantage
of this ICSDIKCCt

Equally important are personal citorts to
lower consumption. one person can and does
make a difference, your consumption ind your
choices iificct the \voild llic SEE noted this
as humanitys greatest impact and gicatest
challenge, indeed it is. lts youi responsibility
to use youi education and knowledge to make
change and] ti iat means making choices cvciy-

turo is in your hands

Dems: Vote yes

All over Iowa, students are working
through their student governments to
pass resolutions opposing President: Bush‘s
plan to increase the number of troops in
Iiaq. They want to send a message: stu-
dents will no longer tolerate fumbling or
equivoctition from elected representatives
on the Iraq war. Too much is at stake to
be sending mole troops to Iraq without
an end in sight.

Herc at Grionell, we Campus Denier
crdtsjoincd in this effort by submitting a
resolution to Joint Board last Wednesday.
The resolution, supported by a number of
other groups on campus, voiced out sup
port for the troops currently stationed in
Iraq and cvpresscd our hope and belief
that there are better ways to ‘save Ameri-
can and Iraqi lives than Bush's plan.

After we submitted the resolution,
joint Board failed to act. Now it’s up- to
snidents to send a powerful message
through an emergency initiative. If you
agree that Bush's plan is wrong, Vote yes
on this resolution. if you agree with the
President, vote no.

Next week, Congress will vote on
symbolic resolutions against Bush’s plan
that will mark a fi , step in changing our
country's Iraq pol . our voice needs to
he heard.
