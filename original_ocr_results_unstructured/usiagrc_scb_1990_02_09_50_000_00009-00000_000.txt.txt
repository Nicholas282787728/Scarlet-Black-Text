ABSOLUTE 'I'Bll'l'll

T 00 Many Weeks
Forces WAC

By Carl Thelin &
John Paul Schmidt

We have experienced a great
proliferation of Weeks this year.
Over the course of this semester, in
fact, we will have more Weeks
than ever before in the history of
the college And surprisingly
enough,3A2is nottoblame. Rather

organically grown spinach is the
culprit. Thanks to these symposiar
tilled seven-day periods, we are
now aware of more things than we
can remember. While this
proliferation of Weeks represents
wonderful student initiative, and
provides excellent extra-curricular
educational opportunities. we
sense impending doom! As the
demand for Weeks grows. it will
become progressively more
difﬁcult for the average Grinnell
denizen to keep track of whose
Week it is. Competition for prime
weeks will be intense, and large.

powerful groups like BIG and
GLGA will be able to defend their
weeks, while smaller. newer
organizations like ARC and PHRC-
Grinnell will be cmshed, leaving
the masses uneducated to their
.concems. .

Fortunately we have devised a
way to avoid this laissez faire
meyhem. Wemustsimplyorganize
a Weeks Awareness Coalition
(WAC) which willactasawalchdog
organization to ensure that weeks
are disu'ibuted fairly, The WAC
will, funhcrmore,organizc and host
a Weeks Week at the beginning of
each semestertoexplain which week
is which, and to offer lectures on
topics such as “Time Management
in the Symposium Age”, “Getting
tthostBangforyourSGABuck",
and“CandlemakingfortheVig‘llant
Vigilcr." Anyone wishing to join
the WAC should apply to the Task
Force for theSelection of theWeeks

Awareness Coalition (TFSWAC);

and anyone interestedinjoining the
TFSWAC should contact Rob
Killion (RK) immediately.

The ACLU, Oliver North and Utopia

This column shall serve as an
introduction for those who don‘t
know me. The fallscmesterof1987
andspringscmesterof19881wrote
a weekly column in these pages
mostly dealing with politics. I
sometimes talked about something
else, butitwas an election year. and
that was what was on my mind, I
wrote about my opposition to the
death penalty. I wrote about my

the Sierra Club now. I am very
much a liberal, and I don't mind
saying it, I am constantly thinking
and rethinking my positions, so I

threats to the constitution and civil

received (or at least printed) very
few lettersof rebuttal ordisapproval.
I guess because a large portion of
Grinnellagnced with my views. The
one highlightofthe year waswhen
a student wrote in to call me a

Article 6 guarantees the CPSU its

I've spent the last year away

is Missouri, birthplace of Webster

Away from controversy, you

ask? I thought all of Grinnell

the Scarlet and Black editorial
advised, Grinnell did not fall into
the same hypocritical hole that
places like Stanford did. No
“restrictions on offensive speech"
were set up. A gigantic success in
my opinion.

a member of that communist
organization, the ACLU, which has
been known to supportNazis,child

North.

Child pomographcrs? In a way.
the ACLU does support child
pornography. Perhaps I’ll try to
explain the difference in a future
column. It's not very easy. and I'm
not very clear on the subject myself,
so perhaps I may skip that column.
Obscene phone-callers? Actually,
we communists like to look at it
from the perspective that machines

I would like to call someone, but
would rather not have them call me

are ways presently to trace
repetitious obscene phone calls.
This new technology mightmake it
easier, but it isn'tnecessary.

Oliver North’.7 I must admit, I
have no ideawhy the ACLUstooped
to supporting OlivcrNorth. I guess
somebody had to. But couldn’t it
have been left to the NRA? Every

I’m sure they would have taken on

to. Why did the ACLU havclodirty
their greatrcputation by supporting
the guy? Iguess every member has
some position the group in general
takes that they disagree with. We
can‘t all be perfect communists.
can we?

In conclusion. I am glad to be
back at Grinnell, where everybody
is tolerant of everybody else, as
long as they have thcpolitically and
socially correct beliefs. Where
liberalism mics. Where thc majority
of the student body are willing to
say they are not opposed to the
illegal use of drugs. And where.
during the presidential campaign,
only one Republican candidate
dared set footon campus Grinnell
is certainly the place to be. Now, if
only we could get those classes out
of the dormitory lounges and back

be the perfect utopia.
