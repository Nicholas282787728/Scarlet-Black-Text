OVEREMPHASIS. ‘7 'J ‘?

papel at Oklahoma Alt going wild with joy at the ape
pointment and now the ctl‘UVill on the campus of Ted Co\.
new messiah of Aggie football.

In a special edition ill which a lilo lino banner u as

pope 1peaklllg tel the entire student body pledged loyaltv
to the new coach.

Hone or. ill the midst of the jubilation ue uondel’
whether 01 not the athletic situation is not being a m'fle
ovelclllph'lslzed at the Oklahoma institution. We know that
this sounds llhe throuing the ploverbial wet blanket. but we
wonder how the enthusiastic Aggie fans will lespolld should
the new coach fail to develop it wonder team?

Floln the extlaiagant display just mentioned, we would
be likelv to say that the spirit is one of a winning team at
ally cost. Too often this same spirit has been manifested in
otheluschools. and this same spirit has not been able to stand
up under a se es of- losses.

]f mlch the case. than we believe that, this is one form
of nvm'elllpl ‘ which can not help but have a harmful effect
upon coll nte athletics as a whole. for ill the last analysis.
is the winning of the games more important than the develop
lug of men upon the football field, regardless of victory?

future football fortunes of the Aggics may serve to point the

Other Editors Say—

WATCH “CATCH PHRASES"

(The Creightonian)

Few men. besides aiter dinner speakers. sideshow barkers. and
brush agents. are greater masters of mob psychology than politicians.

Political bigwigs know the value of catch phrases. They knew
that when they say. “A Chicken 111 Every Pot!” the great unwashed
will immediately run to the polls, deposit therein tlie1r votes. and
scamper home to get out the pots and start the fires

They know that if they cry, "A New Deal": hundreds of thousands
will take their kettles off the stove and run into the dining room
to get the cord tables out. And looking 1n. with their faces pressed
to the window. the “Outs" will hem-sely shout. “Yah-h! A Raw
Deall”

The "Outs" are constantly watching for a chance unlucky phrase
that can be turned about to fire confusion into the ranks of the “Ills”.
That America has a “horse and buggy Constitution" will be vigorously
denied by those same voters who rose 1n arms when told that "the
grass will grow in the streets of a hundred cities.“

It is most regrettable that the multitude sees not the cake for
the frosting. or if you will. the "forest for the trees." To exclude the
catch phrases dangled so invitingly before our faces is not the easiest
thing to do, but it’s more satisfying to hold individual opinions reached
by 1mpartial study than to be clipped and sham by the sheep herders.

G e
The men who try to do something and 11111 are inﬁnitely better
than those who try to do nothing and succeed.

Comes Washington's birthday
and with it the annual curse (for
the men at least) of the Colonial
hall. The best traditions of Grinnell
were upheld this week by Fresh-
men Charles Monroe and Russell
Vance. who solic1ted dates to the
ball and sought advice from upper-
classmei: as to where one obtained
a costume We hope the gentle»
men had the good fortune to se»
cure their dates.

the decreasmg physical proportions
of Fran's courtiers. she started
with Ed Danforth. continuing with

next on the list. or course Bihlen
was bigger than Tommy. but Jerry
Bauer looks like he will continue
the descent. -

\W'lile in a reminiscent mood,
u-e hark back to sturdy men or
the past, of whom Bob Nichols
is the modem prototype. Do
you remember Lomax, who
chopped n hole in Arbor Lake
and went swimming? Then. of
course. there is our man Knupa'
