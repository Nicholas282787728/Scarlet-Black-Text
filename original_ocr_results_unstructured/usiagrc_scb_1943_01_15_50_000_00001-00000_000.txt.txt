Brown of Oak Park, Ill,

 

Creed of a Fighter

‘. . . I have no personal feelings against anyone, because
of their nationality or their creed, but I do have a very
great feeling against anyone or any group 0/ persons that
attempts to stand in my way as to the accomplis nient of
my return to all of you folks. No glory or recognition can
possibly make up for what we are all doing in leaving
our homes and country. The only reward that I can pos-
sibly conceive of being valuable is the safety of those I
have left behind and my return to them at the soonest

”My feelings have been so mixed up and muddled since
we set sail that I hardly know how to express them, It
was quite a sensation to start out to sea for the fir
destination practically unknown. But interwoven with this
sensation of wonderment was the greatest feeling of r —
gret at leaving behind lne everything that is truly impe -
'tllllt to me. The life I want is lost again for an indefinite
period. Anything that I may do while over here will be
done only because it will make the clay sooner that I can
return to that life and those 1700;7le that I want so

Further details concerning
the outstanding record of
achievement of Paul Brown,

’40, army air force pilot who
was killed Nov. 27 in action
over the southwest Pacific,
were released today by Dean
Shelton L, Beatty. The in<
formation was compiled from
photostatic copy of the first
letter Brown wrote from his
overseas station after em—
barking in February, 1942.

Articles praising Brown‘s heroism
had appeared in Chicago, and Oak
Park. 111,. papers and the trade
publication of the Bell aircraft
corporation during thc period he
was In the Pacific theater of wcr.

Chlef one of Brown's exploits
was the dawning of c Japanese
Zero by ramming it out of tbs
sky. According to c telegram from
Lt. Gen, Arnold, iirmy air forces
commanding officer, Gen. Douglas
McArthur reported the incident to
him. While on patrol, Brown spot-
ted six or seven zero fighters.
Picking his target, Brown dovc
upon it. ‘

News stories quoted Brown as
sayln .

“I guess 1 was too cagcr to got
in close enough in usc my ciiinioii.
At any rate, my left wing caught
the Jup’s rudder and fore it off.
The Zcro plunged to ground. 1
had hit him at 3,000 foot and my
ouii plane went into ii divc, I
pulled out at 500 feet. My wing
was damaged, hut I succeeded in
making c cmsh landing. My pals
inndc me u matchbox out ol‘ frug—
mciits of the Zero sticking in my
wing"

Brown had arrived in Australia
early in Mcrch. 1942. His first
combat cxpcrieiicc cccurcd in c
strafing raid on an ciicmy base.
In the following dogfight, c Jap
Zero shot his gas tank so that
all the gnsolinc drained out, Brown

made a pancake landing on a
beach. and With the help of natives
dug out enough scnd to rclensc
the landing gear. Gasoline was
dropping to him from an American
patrol plane scvcicl dcys lstci- and
he returned to his base.

A few days later, Brown hit
one Zcro with cannon fire and the
Japanese plane exploded in mid
air. He was eledited with a Japan-
ese bomber shortly after, when
Poi-t Mol'esby was raided by two
formations, one of 18 and one of
1s ships. He and two other Ameri-
cans went for the 16 formation,
Broun sent one down in flames,
and the action confused the for-
mation so that: thc uthe plnucs

Contracts Needed for College Jobs

Se‘nior Work Rule Valid
With Some Exceptions

Next semester all student
employment will be put on a

basis of written contractual
agreement between the col~
lege and individual student
workers,

This was decided in a meeting
of the student employment com~
mittcc, held Wednesday, accord-
ing to Albert s. Nichols, Voczlr
tions counsellor and student (11117
ploymcnt director.

The rulc forbidding seniors to
work their last semester in school
was not changed, but cci-lnin ex~
ccptioiis may be made at the
present time iiiidcr propcr cir-
cumstances. Employment of son-
iors dciipcnds upon collcgc need
for them and upon the applicant's
financial need and scholastic
standing, Nichols said,

Under this new system of (2017
legerstlldent work
will be necessary for ciuicr party

contracts, ill

to give the other two weeks no-
ticc bcforc terminating the cin-
ploymciit relationship. This SLlpll»
lation is included. Nichols said, to
insure faithfulness on the part of

student workers. In the event
that two \veeks' notice is not
given, payment for a twosweek
period may be suspended, Penal-
ties for uncxcuscd work tardi-
ness and abscnccs are pl'ovlded.

Expressing the belief that many
studcnt workers are ignorant. of
the way that individual students
hourly wage rstcs are determined,
Nichols explained that these are
based upon working appraisals of
the students past work records
which have been turned in by
work supervisors. This factor is
more important than work sons

Brown Outlines
War Minors and
Service Activity

“The policy of Grinnell col-
lege, beginning the second se-
mester, is that every student,
man on woman, be engaged
ill war or community service
activity to justify the con-

tinuance of the college at
all,” Stuart Gerry Brown, chair-
mail of the educational policy
committee, stated Wednesday cvc-
ning at the women's muss meet-
ing. ‘

The plan is not absolutely re-
quired. he explained, but Women
are expected to cooperate,

“If we don't realize what we
have to do us human beings, liv-
ing in these times, all the rules
in the world wouldn’t do any
good," Brown asserted,

The college, through the com-
mittee on educational policy, has
attempted to coordinate the de<
mands of the government, the
armed scrviccs, and industry in
the courses offered as war mi-
nors. These courses, for which
normal credit will be given, in-
clllde drafting, community recre~
ation, medical laboratory aides,
modern language translator, car-
tography, occupational Lheapy, of-
fice work, medical secretary,
photography, engineering aide,
meteorology, music recreational
director, and art recreational di-
rector.

A present minor in subjects rc-
[fried to ii major may, without
loss of credit, be exchanged for a
“'ﬂl‘ minor. However, this is not
necessary if the student is at
present registered in a war major.
A student carrying only three
courses will be expected to carry
an extra-curricular activity even
though the three courses include
part of d War minor.

Thcsc wcr minors will fill the
enormous need now existillg' for
women with some training in vs—
rious fields. Anticipated demands
have been made known by private
llldustry and the government, and
it is in view of these demands
that the war minors have been
sct up.

“At present there are 10,000
lcss students enrolled in social
