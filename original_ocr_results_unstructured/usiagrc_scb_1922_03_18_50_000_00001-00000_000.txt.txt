Ineﬂy who ran the quarter in that
event and who will run the individual

Captain Paulo. Bryan, and Smith are

. scheduled to enter the sprints. Dough-

Pioneers who will have a chance to
show their endurance in the distance
events. Reece will compete in the
half-mile run. Mcilrath will step the
lie—yard dash. Stock will compete in
both the high hurdles and the broad
jump. Porter will skim the low hur—
tiles. Jansscn is the man designated
to show his powers in the shot out

Mon Not Yet In Shape.
Several men who should be good

point producers have not yet roundedI

into shape and therefore the squid tat-
ken on this trip is not as large as
those which will probably represent
the Pioneers in later meets.

There has been some discussion 5.3
to what men will run in the mile relay
team. Thrcs hf the probable mem-
bers of the team will he Bryan, Reece
and McIlrath. Paulu ran this event

last year but there has been eonsideT-’

ztble doubt as to whether he will be
used on so long a run this year.
