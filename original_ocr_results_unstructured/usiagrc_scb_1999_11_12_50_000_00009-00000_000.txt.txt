The National Assomation

that Varsirybooks.corn has
been misleading students
about potential onlinesavings,

In the midst of its initial
public stock offering, the
nation's ﬁrst online textbook
retailer is now righting to make
sure its stock does not ﬂntline
when it hits the market.

In a suit filed at 10 a in,
Monday by the Nanonal Ase
sociation or college stores,
lnc., Varsitybooks.com has
been accused of making false
and misleading advertising
elalms about its discounts and
oii-campus stores' pricing
schemes.

NACS, an organization or
3,000 college bookstores, is
seeking an Injunction against
the site for its insistence that
it offers texts at 40 percent
below the “suggested price.”

NACS ofﬁcials say this
price standard does not exist
in the college textbook market
and that the web site’s prices
only rarely beat onecampus
stores by 40 percent

“We want them to stop
making claims about a sug»
gested once," said Cynthia
D'Angelo, senior associate eit—
ccutivc dlrecror of NACS.
“There are very few textbooks
that oriet a suggested price.
They advertise a discount or

40 percent, yet that’s not the
industry standard “

Jim Wilkerson, director of

Duke UniversitySrote-s said he
uses some suggested prices to
set the University's inesrote
prices, adding rhar he relies on
other merhodswhen book dis-
tributors do not suggest a tee.
