Wednesday and Friday after
classes? No, besides the bar. They go
bowling!

noon from 4:00 to 5:00pm. Grinnell
offers a half credit Physical Education
class on a pass/fail basis in bowling.
“I’ve been here fourteen years and
the bowling class has been around as
long as I can remember,” said Bowling
Instructor Andy Hamilton. “It's one of
maybe twenty or twenty-ﬁve activity
classes that the Physical Education Dr,
partrnent offers.“
Hamilton, who has been the Instruo

tor for the last two years, said Last year
we had forty snidents and this year we
limitedthe enrollment tothiny because of
cost constraints. lt ﬁlled up quickly."
There is no student fee and the cost
is built into the budget of the physical
education department. he said.
Hamilton doesn‘t teach bowling
formally but rather walks around giving
helpfulhirits andintlividual instruction to
students as they bowl.
“I usually bowl one gamcaday and
1 try to bounce around from lane to lane.
Some of the snidents would prefer that
I’m on anodierplanei [because] they get
so nervous when I'm around [but] some
of them really thrive on it.” he said.
“It's a nice opportunity to get out
and do something in the middle of win-

However, wme students do take
the class more than once in their college
camels

“I’mttfouryearvetemn ofbowling,"
said seniorKirkJohnson, who has metop

free and otherwise you have to pay $1.75
a game and I’m cheap." Johnson said

Hamilton said that the most interest
ing lhingabout the class ishowseiious the
students get about their bowling.

“I compute their averages on a
weekly basis and with very few exeep
tions all the students are getting higher
averages as the class progresses,"
Hamilton said.

So why do people join bowling?

number of players.

“Inthewinterwconlyhaveabout
ten people [practicing]," said Laura
Shulte, one ofthe Co-captains ofthe
women’s team.

As it result, most winter prac-
tices are co-ed. Since Ultimateisn't
avarsity sport.Shultepoints out “You
can't make people come to practice."

However. Co-captain of the
Grinncllcphants Jan Solon feels that
“[Ultimate is} a bunch oipcople who
aren't disciplincd enough to be in a
varsity sport.”

This spring the teams hope to
play in tournaments in St. Louis, the
Twin Cities. and other areas in the
midwest. To avoid the cost ofa hotel
for the two or three day tournaments
the players will often ﬁnd alumni or
other Frisbee players from the hostr

ing schools to stay with.

“Frisbee players are usually
pretty hospitable,” said Shulte.

BoththeMen’sandtheWomen’s
teams hope to recruit playeis this
spring.

“We try to practice and be vis-
ible so people get interested and join
us," said Solon.

Mostplayers arejustpeoplewho
like throwing a Frisbee around and
who haven’t had any previous expe
rience other than the casual game.
Thcwomen'steamisespeclallyhopv
ing to recruit ﬁrstyears, because they
have none. Anyone interested in join-
ing the men’s‘ team should contact
Solon and anyone interested in join
ing the women’s team should VAX
