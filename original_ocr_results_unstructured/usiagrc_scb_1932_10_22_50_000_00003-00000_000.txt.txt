Capable Football
Material Abundant

On Yearling Squad

Thirty-five freshmen have been
football squad under the direction of
Coach J. c, Trucsdale for the past
two weeks. A wealth of capable men
has been revealed, and many of the
aspirants show pIomlsc of becoming
varsity men next season.

The first year men have been
scrimmaged against the vets ,
squad on several occasions, and each
time they managed to malt. (he
pcrienced men realize their presence.

Three games have been scheduled
for the freshmen this year. They will
play the Drake preps, Coe freshmen,
and the Iowa State Teachers first
year men, but the dates for these
games have not been definitely de-
cided.

One of the most outstanding men
on the squad is James Bradley, Hal‘s
hor Springs, Michigan. who received
all»state mention while playing on
the high school team. Bradley is an
Indian. and has ability in passing,
kicking and running. The end posi-
tions for the freshman team will be
occupied by Bob and Bill Evans,
twins, who have long arms and have
an ability at catching passes.

Truesdale has a heavy line to work
with and with a little training they
should develops into capable men.
Don Mailum, Des Moines, was given
a place on the allvcity team at Des
Moines last year and is competing
for the guard position. Many other
men have been showing up well in
practice and a weil rounded team will
be formed by the time for the first

There is a stocky young man play-
ing his last year on the Grinnell col-
lege football squad who bids fair to
equal the phenomenal record set by
Henry Thomas in 1931, when that
lantern-jawed quarterback earned
the remarkable distinction of being
acclaimed the individual star of
every game in which he participated,

» That young man in question is
Richard Inlrich, he of the gifted toe.
.who by now has won a place in the
Missouri Valley firmanicnt along
with other stars of the first magni-
tude, So far this season he has been
the outstanding man in each of the
four games now played on the Plo-
ncer schedule.

Michigan State sports writers in
East Lansing landed him as one of
the greatest players to perform on
the home gridiron in the past few
seasons. Besides his ability to carry
the hall, Dick is one of the greatest
punters ever to don the moleskins for
the scarlet and black. Nearly a dozen
times this year, he has kicked the
ball out of bounds inside the oppon-
ents' 10-yard line.

up in 1931 after the third game of the
season, nnd was on the sidelines for

A1 Rose has now joined Captain
Fritz Graflund as one of the leading
candidates for the all»Valley post at
fullback. Rose's fine work in the
games thus far has been overshadow
ed by that of Ullrich, but his vicious
tackling has now mode him a much
feared opponent. Although his Shoul-

are weak, Rose’s tackling is so
me that the opposiLion seldom
gains around his side of the line.

Young Democrats Hear
Former Football Coach

Mike Hyiond, former Grinnoll foot-
ball coach, addressed the Democratic
club of Grinnell college, at a meeting
Wednesday evening in the Superior
court room. Mr. Hyland is now prac-
ticing low in' Tame.

At the present time, attempts are
being made by William Pryor. chair-
man of the men's committee of the
club, and by Mayor Nelson of Grin-
nell, to secure Louis Murphy, of Du~
buque, Democratic candidate for U.
s. senator, as a speaker. Nothing
definite has, as yet, been arranged,
however.
