LINCOLN DAY IS
CELEBRATED AT Y‘

“Work—Not Luck—Caused Lin-
coln‘s Success’ ’~Hsywood.

“The general opinion that Abi'allaml
Lincoln was an ordinary man with liiSl
greatness thrust upon him by some di»
vine good fortune is not at all true,"
according to H. L. Haywood in his
tallt on the “Life of Lincoln" at Y. M.‘
c. A. Thursday night.

Mr. Haywood contended that Lin—
coln was one of the greatest thinkers‘
and best read men of his time or any
other and was thoroughly Prepared for
his great task when he was elected to
the presidency.

Lincoln was the greatest speaker Df‘
his day and a committee of three of
the best lawyers could not ﬁnd a sin-
gle {law in his epoch mahing'speeeh
hetore the Cooper Union at New York.
These young men of the Republican
party which had just been organlzeo,
aitcr that speech decided to nominate
him for the presidency.

Mr. Haywood gave an interesting ac—
count ot Lincoln's lile while a store—
heener at Springﬁeld, during which
period he spend all his leisure time in
an office at the back or hisrstol‘e,
where he and his partner read every—
thing they could and on current topics.
especially on slavery. After reading a
page they would discuss the contents
thoroughly,

According to Mr. Haywood, Lincoln
was not the hard working rail splitter
that he has eornnronly heen pictured
hut in the words of his brother Hank.
"Lincoln sat against a stump and read
W lie I split the rails."

Mr. Haywood gave a. number of
other interesting tales of Lincoln's
lite. \

AT THE‘COLONIAL.

The Colonial theater announces that
it has secured J. Stuart Blackton‘s
newest photo drama, “The Moonshine
Trail," ior presentation next Monday

those popular tovorites, Sylvia Brea—
n-ler and Robert Gordon. It is the ﬁrst
at i}. new series of big dramatic human
heart interest subjects that J. Stuart
Blaclrton is going to produce for dis-
tribution by Fame.

"The Moonshine Trail" is a story of
youth—youth when lt faces one of the
hig problems of lite and realizes how
it'must huilt for the future. Miss
Breamer is delightlnlly east in the
role ot a girl who is as sweet and
lovely as the Wild azaleas in her
mountain home. Mr. Gordon plays
the difficult role of a. young man who
sees his own future mirrored in hi
father, whose craving for liquor has
made him an outcast.
