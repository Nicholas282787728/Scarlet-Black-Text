V'el‘sy result from an inadequate or inc
correct conception of the purpose and
nature of these tests.

Intelligence tests are not ends in
No student's grade is de—
termined by means of his IQ. No in—

themselves.

Sued by means or his IQ,

The testing of mental capacity is

,of a subject. By native intelligence is
usually meant the capacity to under—
stand relationships nod to make apprm
pn‘ate reactions. Even its staunchest
advocate does not claim that the inteL
ligence test is infallible even in the re-
stricted ﬁeld of native intelligence. He
does claim, and rightly, that thosel
tests are the most reliable means yetI
devised for determining innate men-,
tailty. , t

No one claims that the tests can

 

measure character or social ability.
And certainly character and social;
ability are two factors of pre-emlnent_
importance in making or breaking
success. Nor do the tests measure,
in any great degree, effort, persever-

MiceV or interest.

l
And certainly these

qualities are almost, it not entirely, as
potent factors in determining class—
room grades as is native ability.

The tests then measure only native
ah ty, the capacity to become intel—
ligent. They enable the instructor to
know whether or not a student is
working up to his mental ability. They
enable a student to understand his own

mental equipment. ’

They should inspire the 200 point
man to make his’ accomplishment
equal his capacity, They should spur
on the man of lower rating to make
the most of his abilities through in.
creased effort and perseverance and
to cultivate character and social abil-
ity. For after all, as we said once
before, "the capacity to understand rer,
lationhsips" is but one factor in de-
termining success both in and out or
college,

Unless we smrt out with thc assump-
tion that ignorance is bliss, we can
not condemn intelligence tests in the
ileld to which we have restricted
them, although we realize all the while
that they are still imperfect and that,
it may be many years before a truly
accurate test or native intelligence is
devised.
