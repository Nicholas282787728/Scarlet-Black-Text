Professor Jesse Macy, L L. D.

My very Dear Friend:—

Iam overwhelmed by the kinds
ness of Grinnell friends which has

could learn some language, ancient or
modern, Yninpnli or Esperanto. which
would enable me to give expression to
my appreciation oi the good words
alidrleeds in my Ifl‘. i’ “hich so fat
transcend all merit, and especially
those in which you have been so it!-
cently an aCLoi' and an IiispliaLlOn

As I iezirllhe mass of letters sell:
me I run painfully and gratefully
conscious of the time Lis well as of the
thought and money it has cost.

But, all in all llllW I am carried
back to 151: Wleli I Came (0 this
hamlet in hope, 31 (l was so kindly re
carved by all. The years brought
others into the scl‘uu'. splendid boys
and girls who grew up and broadened
into iamous teachers, scholars,
authors, lecturers and statesmen.
whose \‘ery namesliare dlviaysliindled
adame or ever rmewmg honor and
aﬁeclioii in my own heart the more
tenderly too because they themselves
were so cherished by llie [li'vcious
angel at my side nho was called away
seven years ago this very day. 1 can
not iorget that these tokens oi respect
for myself are largely fooled in [he
love for her and by her for them.

\Vell (In I Iriio“ how much I Owe to
all these, and to others who have
dropped into my hie as the years have
gone by.
years illuminate lateryears, and ever
renewing generosity brings ever, re-
newing gratitude.

For these yesterdays and today-s 1
would {Iain give adequate [hanks if it

Love and gratitude to you and all
Whose names have been brought me.
