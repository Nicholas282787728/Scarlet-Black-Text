“Liberal spending”— most expensive courses

by PaulMDr 5

Suppose you have an interest in
printmaking, European theatre,
medical studies, Christian
scriptures, and you‘d also like to
take private voice lessons.

How much would it cost you? A
cool $547.50.

This figure includes current
prices for books for courses offered
next year, clinical equipment, and
private voice lessons.

But these are not the only areas
in which liberal arts means liberal
spending. A random sampling of
current bookstore price lists shows
many courses which push up
student budgets,

European Theatre: I850 to
Present is currently the most
expensive course on the bookstore
list, The 37 books on the list add up
to roughly $90. Professor Ellen
Mease attributes the cost to the
present copyright laws. Mease
added that the anthology for the
course has gone out of print. She is
t ing to keen the book costs down

by putting the course readings on
reserve. She also pointed out that
the majority of students taking the
course have purchased the books
for previous courses,

In reference to medical study
costs, Professor Irving Fishman
said that clinical equipment {or
Rush»Medical students could run,
at a maximum, as high as 3225. But
this price could be substantially
lower depending on where the
student buys the equipment, he
said.

At present rates. private voice
lessons run about 5115.

An interest in printmaking will
cost you $70. Professor Robert
McKibben said, “This $70 covers
printmaking supplies. which would
cost around $200, if purchased out
of class."

Biochemistry. taught by
chemistry professor Elliott
Uhlenhoppi costs $52.50.
Uhlenhopp said he was not aware
of the cost of books for the course.
He said he lelt concerned and

hoped by putting some of the
courses‘ books on reserve,the costs
could be lowered.

Microscopic Anatomy, taught by
biology professor John Martinek,
runs about $44. Martinek said,
“The high cost can be attributed to
the fact that the books are stan-
dard medical texts; they have a
limited demand," He added they
couldn‘t be put on reserve because
they are used as reference
material in the future,

Chris Ian Scriptures requires
books which cost about $41,
Professor Dennis Haas said it is
hard to put the books on reserve
with enrollment running near 45
students. He said he does try to
keep the course loads down by
putting some readings on reserve
and by ordering paper back
editions.

 

 

 

The man behind the grants

Robertson gives it a hand

number of programs altered by the

it.”
