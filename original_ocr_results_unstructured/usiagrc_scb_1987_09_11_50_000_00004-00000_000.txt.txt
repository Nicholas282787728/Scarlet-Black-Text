One man’s battle withAlDS

 

by Bruce Emond

It was November was when
Thom, then a niaitre d' and
waiter at several private clubs
in the Des Moines nren, ﬁrst
noticed a purplish, nloleesized
blemish on his right thigh. A
resident of San Francisco at the
beginnin of the AIDS outbreak
during t e early 1980s, Thom
knew of Kaposi's Sarcoma, a
rare skin cancer and telltale
symptom of AIDS, yet he was
unconcerned. “l thou ht i must
have accidentally staibed my-
self with an ink pen," remem—
bers Thom. “I had been very
tired and had been sleeping a
lot, which was unusual for me,
but I thou ht that l wasjust go-
ing through mid-life crisis."

Within a month, however,
’I‘honl lost weight rapidly, dc~
veloped unexplained pustules on
his right arm, and experienced
night sweats. Too out of breath
even to climb the stairs to his
apartment, Thom consnltecl a
doctor and was diagnosed as
having pneumocystis pneumo—
nia, a common infection among
AIDS patientc A bio sy taken
simultaneously revealer that the
ink mark was actually a KS lc»
sion.

Today, after enduring bouts
with pneumonia, spinal menin-
gitis (which required seven
spinal ta s), and the loss of sight
in his le t eye due to a viral in-
fection, Tholu is a patient at Des
Moines' Mercy Hospital. Unlike
man AIDS patients whose men»
tal aculties have deteriorated
as the disease has progressed
Thom remains a vibrant an
alert man, his speech littered
with references to the runny pro»
ple and cities he has known. Ex-
tremely thin (at 5' 10" he weighs
a mere llo pounds), Thom’s

the physical ravages of A DS
and the emotional toll of losing
friends and lovers to the disease,
Thom is realistic about his fu»
ture. "Death is just a part of

A native of Des Maines. Tholu
describes his childhood as “LIaus
matic," “There was never any
closet for me," he says wryly. “It
was ,very‘ ditiicult being overtly
gay in t e early 605, especially
in a conservative city like Des
Molnes." After coming out to
his parents at the age of it,
Thom left home ﬁve years later

al y and ﬁnancially, but in 1972
Thom once again elected to
move, this time to San Kane
cisco his “dream" city. Thorn
recollects his initial shock at the
tolerance towards homosexuals
itv in the city. “I had a fab
ulous time in Chicago but San
Francisco was amarin . I made
friends with people w to didn‘t
eare if I was gay or straight,
This would never have happened
in Des Moines,“ he says.

tender and bath attendant at
several ga baths. He had
been intro uced to drugs when
he lived in Chicago, but in
San Francisco he began heavily
to use drugs, tparticularly ain-

hetai nes an heroin. “You

ave t understand that this was
the nu -t0s, the time of the sex~
ual revolution and all that. Peo-
ple were doing and tryin every.
thing and anything, and I was

1n the winter of mo, San
Francisco's gay community was
alarmed by tho mysterious
deaths ofseveral ofits members,
Thom observes that panic and
confusion pervaded the city's
gay bars and clubs. “We didn't

now what was happening,” he
says. “One week yon would
see a friend at the bar and
the neat week they were dead.
People were dropping like flies."
Then nnaamed, the disease was
known by repute as the “guy
cancer.”

Tllom remembers bitterly the
tardiness of the city and federal
government in addressing the
new disease. “The ga commu-
nity was begging for trip from
them Etlte government] but they
took t ieir time. It was like their

attitude was this is a disease of

queers and junkies so we don‘t
care.“

The recent slew of articles
and television documentaries on
AIDS has done little to dis
cl Thom's frustration at the
LS. overnment and media
in deaing with the epidemic.
He sees the media creating
an illusory feeling of security
among heterosexuals Thom be.

"Tbere’s no such ﬁning as
safe sex, just safer sex.”

Thom, a person with AIDS.

lieves that, particularly among
straight women, there is compla.
cency and denial. “The news—
papers are just printing all the
crap the government is churn-
ing out so that people won‘t
panic. People just keep dicking
around thinking that it won‘t
infect them [but] yes. Dorothy.
AIDS happens in Kansas, and it
can happen in GIinnell, too."
Thom recommends that peo—
ple be wary ofslerping with new
artners. “The doctorr say the
incubation period [for AIDS} can
be up to nine years, and you
don't know who or what your
artuer did a few years back,"
I' one does decide to have sex,
Thom believes that a condom
used in conjunction with a sper-
micide is the most eﬂ‘ective pree
vention, but even than titer: are
risks. “Thu: could be a scrape
on your knee or cuts on your ﬁn-
gers where the virus could en-
ter. There's no such thing as
safe sex. just safer sex,“
In 1952, partly because of his
mother‘s illness and also because

he felt stiﬂed by the almost daily

news of old friends and lovers
dying with Ale, Thom moved
back to Des Moines. Three years
later, he was living with his
lover Mark,and had atched up
old differences with is mother
when AIDS struck.

“It was always in the back
of my mind that I could have
Ale, but i was still despon-
dent when I actually was told
by the doctors," says Thom.
initially depressed. Thonl's old
friends from Chicago and San
Francisco, what he terms his
“gay family helped him over-
come his problems.

For Thom‘s mother and his
lover. the acceptance was much
harder. “After a while I had no
trouble accepting it but no one
told me about the reaction of
family and friends. My mother
has had to face the fact that
both her husband and her son
will have died before her." obs
serves Thom. While Thoul‘s
mother has gone through conn-
seling and is now “doing ﬁne,"
Mark's fears about the disease
were too overwhelniin for him.
“He called me once an that was
it. I think he‘s now living in

Ames somewhere,“ says Thorn.

For the past 15 months, Thom
has been taking Anriothyniidine
(AZT), a drug which has proved
effective in lessening the come
plications of AIDS in many pae
tients. Before AZT was ap
proved by the Food and Drug
Administration, Thorn was one
of a select group of Ale pa-
tients in the nation receiving
samples of the drug. The side
effects ofAZT are numerous, in-
cluding anorexia, nausea, and
diarrhea, yet Thorn calls the
drug “a lifesaver; it’s helped me
live longer than I should have."
The 3900 cost ofa month’s AZT
pills and his 3260 hospital room
are paid for by insurance.

Since July, Thom has been
taking Ganciclovir, another ex-
perimental AIDS drug. Thom
yokes that the drug, which is ad-
ministered intravenously three
times daily, is so strong that “if
you put it in your car, it would
clean the engine in a minute."

Thom still occasionally vi ts
The Brass Garden, a gay bar in
Des Moines, but having AIDS
has changed his erspective on
the bar scene. “’imien I o to
the bar these days I'm not oak»
ing at people as sexual objects
anymore, Just o to observe
and be around ol friends. It‘s
something very new and inter-
esting for Ine.’ Thom cautions
that many ga s in Des Moines
have not hee ed the warnin s
about AIDS, and there is stil
the attitude that it is a coastal
disease. “People still see it as
a “California" or “West-Coast"
disease, which is a bunch otbull.
Just take alook at all the people
on this ward," he says.

Thom dismisses the argument
that AIDS is God’s retribution

against homosexuals. “I 'was
raised a Catholic and we thrive
on uilt so for along timelwas
ui ty about being gay. AIDS is
Ike the fuudalueutnllst hetero-
srxnal's dream: God‘s revenge
on homosexuals. but for me
God is all-loving, all-caring. and
I doubt she sent this down for
me," says Thom.

Thom's room at Mercy is spa-
cious and airy, commanding an
impressive view of the hospital
grounds. One wall of the room
is decorated with cards and pho-
tographs from his many friends,
and a stack of videos on the
television attests to Thom’s pas-
sion for old movies. lie also en-
joys reading, althon h his ar.
tial blindness has made this im-
cnlt. Thom says he has little ap-
Ertitc (“Waiters are alwa s tlun

ecanse you're surronn ed by
food all day so you don‘t want to
eat" , but he chaimsmokes and
driu s occasionally. Although
panic about contractin AIDS is
rife, Thom oints out hat peo-
ple with col s or infeetions are of
more a threat to him than he is
to them. “I have to worry all the
time who I am around. i dread
to think what would happen if
someone came in here with the
measles or chicken pox."

Thom has little tolerance for
selfpity among his fellow AIDS

atientsr “You hear people say,
Why me?‘ and I want to shout
back, ‘Why not you?’ Nothing
in life is guaranteed." he admits
to havin considered suicide "a
couple o? times when I thought
i was being a burden,“ but he
credits an analyst and his own
involvement with Ale support
groups in Des Moines with help.
