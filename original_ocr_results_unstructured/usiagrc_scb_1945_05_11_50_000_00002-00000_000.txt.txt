An Honor Cour+ - -

Now that the Honor System has been in
effect for a year, and the students have
had a chance to see it wol ing, it is time
to discuss tlle extension, revision, and mod-
ification of it, The system is still in the
experimental stage. Its final form has not
yet been shaped.

Within the next two weeks a mass meet-
ing of the students will be held in order
to discuss any changes ill the existing sysr
tern, One of the most pressing questions
will be the establishment of an Honor
Court. Before this question actually arises,
it would be well for the students to do 1
some serious thinking on the matter. :

At present, the administering of the:

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

system is in the hands of the Student
Council. Whether a separate organization
should be established or not, is, of course,
the main point. It would be wise to know
exactly wllat functions the Honor Court
would have and whether or not these dur
ties are important enough to be delegated
to a separate body, They would have to,
first of all, handle the voting every fall
when the system itself is discussed at the
first mass meeting of the year, Secondly,
they would hear and act upon the com-
plaints of both student.and faculty con-
cerning the system. Primarily, their big
job would be that of orienting the new
freshman classes to the system every year.
They would be called upon to listen to any
reports of offenses from either faculty or
student, and to mete out the punishment
in case i is deemed necessary,

This represents an important and an ex-
tremely responsible task. If the Student
Council were to continue with the Work and
to do it efficiently, it might mean that
they would be unable to handle properly
the other matters of student government,
which in the past, have been pressing
enough to keep them occupied.

Another important thing to take into
consideration is the operation of the system
in other schools. All colleges that are now
working under this system do have an
Honor Court. It is considered a necessary
and an integral part of the plan.

If the system is kept in operation it‘

'should be kept functioning with the highs

est possible degree of efficiency. A delee
gation chosen from the various classes to

handle the Couit would probably representl

the best possible solution for keeping the
plan in good running order.

Grinnell Observes

Prcsrdcnt Truman‘s announcer
ment of VE day, broadcast
the early morning of May 8, was
received on the Giinnell campus
in much the same way that it
was received throughout the
country.

Students listened solemnly to
the short speech, and went on
about their business, with mixed
feelings of relief at the release
of the long expected news, and
annoyance at the international
quihbhng that had withheld of-
iicial confirmation from it public
already aware of the fact of
vcitory, and with every right to
know.

All of them thought of rela-
tives and friends in the European
theater who would now be free
of the danger that had hung over
them these many months, Some,
whose loved ones are stationed in
the Pacific theater, resented any
thought of celebration. indeed,
there was none of the hilarity
that followed the World War I
armistice. Classes were suspcnd-
ed for the day, but the morning
was spent in studying, song prac-
ticcs, and general looting, Some
rolled over and went back to

sleep after the cpochsl anliounce—‘

ment.

Formal recognition of the
event was given in a chapel serv—
ice. held at three in Herrick chap»
e1. President' Samuel N. Stevens
spoke. Among other things, he
said, “In victory, we are far
from arrogant. We are humble,
reverent, even a little depressed.
Peace doesn't settle things . .
It only permits men to work to»

singing. An auction was held
of articles from the lost-and»
round department, the proceeds
gicng to the national Red Cross,
Jack Hartley was auctioneer,
eggmg the bidders on to generr
csity. When the last article was
sold, the tlll held $53.

The historic day ended as qui-
cuy as it had begun. Grinnel-
lians were Savmg the laughter and
singing and mad celebration unr
til VA day, when all the killing

,would be at an end, when every-

one could join in the festivities.
And cvcry Grimellian’s thoughts
were as much of the final peace
settlement as of the surrender.
VE day was a link in a chain,
as strong as its weakest link. , .
VE day, VA day, the peace
terms.
