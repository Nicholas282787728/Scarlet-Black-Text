Summer Session.

“Iowa College will this year.
for the ﬁrst time. hold a summer
session. This session will con»
tinue for six weeks, beginning
Tuesday.June rig. and closing Fri-
day, july 27, 1900.”

This statement is taken (mm
the recently issued announcement
of the summer session. It is
hoped that all who are interested
in tile plan will examine this little
pamphlet with some care, and aid
in giving it an appropriate and
broad distribution. Only a few
details in the way of explanation
and comment can be noted in this
article. Any member of the fac-
ulty who offers courses for the
summer will be glad to give furs
therand personal explanation to
inquirers.

It will be noted that the time of
the session is such. as to leave a
few days ofgraceafter commences
merit, June 13th, and a full six
weeks and a half of interval be
tween the close of the summer
work and the beginning of the
fall term.

This plan is the outcome of
careful and considerable discus-
sion by the faculty. While in
some ways necessarily an eXpe '-
ment, it is not'at all an expe .
ment so far as concerns the qlialir
ty oi the work and the desire of
the faculty to add in a distinct
and rational manner, to the use-
tulness of the college, The trus-
tees have given their approval. it
is hoped that many students will
lind it possible to give their hear-
ty cooperation, withoutwhich cer-
tainly any important success will
be impossible.

It is necessary to distinguish
rather carefully between the “slim-
mer school” and the “summer
session”otapermanent, full or-
ganlzed and \vellrequipped insti-
tution of learning. The summer

 

session is one of many responses
to the recent professional and
popular demand for larger ideas
of education. Other responses,
such as the traveling library, the
courses of instruction in the daily
press, etc,, will suggest themselves
to everyone. It is not necessaly
to assert that there is equal value
in all these efforts.

Forthe coming session,a iacuity
of fourteen members, composed
of professors and instructors of
the home force, offer (excluding
a tew options) twentyrfour dis
tinct couises. The work offered
is entirely of the same quality as
that of the regular college cilrrie
culum and will give equivalent
credits. Without making any unr
just discrimination, it is interest-
ing to note the opportunities for
study especially appropriate for
the summer se'ason, and leading
one actually aﬁeld ill the courses
in physical culture. surveying. en-
tomology, etc. It is quite prob-
able that a few courses not given
in the announcement may be add-
ed later. Not only will the library
be open, but the librarian Will be
in attendance and willing to aid
any students who may wish to use
the time to malte extended studies
in‘some particular direction. The
opportunity lor doing some of
that "general reading“ which we
are all always planning and never
pertorming,rs also an excellent
one. The llbraiy is growing
monthly, and there will probably
be important additions between
the present time and the summer.

It will be noted that \several
courses are planned with special
reference to teachers This does
not mean that the college will at-
tempt to cnter the ﬁeld of the
normal school. or normal institute
or graduate work in pedagogy.
It is hoped, however that a liberal
per cent. of the attendance will
be composed of public school
teachers who may combine with
extenslon or renewal of their
knowledge in any particular sub-
jcct with some growth in the meth-
od and power of teaching the sub-
ject.

in taking this step the faculty
is not moved by any secret diplor
matic motive, nor by any wild
craving for the impossible. The
summer session is already an es~

 

tablished fact in our own state as
well as elsewhere throughout the
country, and there is every reason
to expect its permanence and fur-
ther evolution.

Chrestomathian.

The ﬁrst meeting of the Chres-
iomathian society for the new
year was held last Saturday even-
ing under conditions, which, if
they continue, will make the clos-
ing year ofthe nineteenth cen-
tury the most prosperous known
in the history oi the society. The
debate with the Philomathian so-
cicty of the State University has
infused new life into the debating
element, and it is expected that a
large number will take part in the
preliminary contest, which is to
be held January 20, to choose the
three speakers to represent the
society. The dating compact was
ratiﬁed at the business meeting,
and now only awaits the action of
the Philomathian society. The
debate will be held in Grinnell,
but the exact date is not yet
known.

Mr. Moller and J. E. Parker
were appointed to escort the new
president, Mr.A. Risser, to the
cllair. This being done, the soci-
ety listened to a well prepared
speech by the new president, in
which he made a plea for more
original work. and spoke of the
better days which he expected
would come. The program was
extemporaneous, there being six
speakers. who were given their
question about three hours before
the time of meeting. Hamlin.
McCarty and Quait were appoint-
ed as judges.

The ﬁrst speaker was Moller,
who spoke on the “Boer War, and
the lesson which England has
learned." The speaker gave a
brief review of the causes and
events which led up to the pres
ent war. Speaking oi “The Perr
sonnel of the New Congress,” Mr.
McKeag told a nulnber of inter-
esting facts as to the character
and occupation ot the members
of Congress. The industrial prob»
lems of today were discussed at
some length by Mr. Meade. who
