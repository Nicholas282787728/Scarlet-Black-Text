Sports Information

After kicking off the season with a
disappointing loss. many question
marks surrounded the Grinnell Col-
lege football team. But with a deer-
stve victory over Prilicipia in their
home opener the Pioneers (1-1)
proved to themselves and to the rest
of the Midwest Conference that they
are a force that cannoibe counted out.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd at
Rosenbloom Field, Grinnell dis-
mantled the Panthers. 47-14.

The game was off to a rousing start
when senior quarterback Sean Cotten
connected with standout receiver Ri-
chard Werner for a 63-yard touch-
down strike early in the ﬁrst quarter.
Cotten, who ﬁnished 10-15 for 222
yards passing, followed up with a
mshing touchdown from a yard out
and a second touchdown pass to
Werner. putting Grinnell ahead 20-0.
Princrpia staged a minor rally early in
the second quarter with a score and a
two-point conversion. But sophomore
running back Wade Krause padded the
lead with two touchdown runs. At
halftime the Pioneers held a

comforable 33-81ead.

The second halfwas a mere formal-
ity as the Pioneer dcfensc kept the
Panthers in check, Sophomore defen-
sive back Stall Banks also showed his
mettle with an interception. a fumble
recovery and a blocked punt, Offen-
sively junior fullback Jim Hart, who
ﬁnished with 92 yards on only 12 car-
ries, scored in the third quarter on an
11-yard run. Cotten then polished off
the scoring with another short touch-
down run, Principia nlounted a late
touchdown drive but at the ﬁnal gun,
the scoreboard showed a 47-14 rout
“I was pleased wttli the progress we
made in every facet of the game,"
stated Coach Greg Wallace. “We
made some grelii strides in the of-
fense. the defense, and the kicking
game."

The team will have no opportunities
to rest easy, This Saturday the Pio-
neers will travel to Beloit, a fomii-
dablc opponent from the Midwest
Conference North Division. “Beloit
is a perennial North Division favor-
ite," remarked Coach Wallace. “They
are solid on both offense and defense.
This game will deﬁnitely be a major
challenge for us.” concluded Wallace.

 

 

 

Linksters prepare for road

By SETH KLEIMAN

Sports Information

The Grinnell College women’s
golfteam is continuing to improve
and is focusing on performing at
its highest level this weekend as it
will take part in the Loras and
Luther tournaments on Friday and
Saturday.

Last weekend the linksters
played through adverse weather
conditions at the Knox Invitational
in Galesburg, IL as cold tempera-
tures and high winds prevailed.
“The course was also extremely
difficult," remarked Coach Dee
Fairchlld. "It has tight fairways
and fast greens and this combina-
tion did not help us at all. How-

ever, the course was obviously dif-
ficult for everyone because none
ofthe teams scored as well as they
had the previous week.“ she added.
Sarah Jirousek and Vanessa Smith
were the low scorers for Grinnell
on the day, each compiling a 102.

This week in practice the Pio-
neers are attempting to improve
their short game and putting in
preparation for the two upcoming
tournaments. “I expect us to fare
better this Friday and Saturday,"
commented Fairchild. “These two
courses will be easier because they
are more open. We merely need
to remain calm and composed and
I am certain that We Will perform
at the level which we are capable

 

of," she concluded ,

Last Saturday the Pioneers were
bested in a tight match against ex-
tremely talented Gustavus
Adolphus. The kickers started off
strong and held their ground as the
Gustavus offense repeatedly
knocked on the door, but was
snuffed out by the tenacious defense

ess and patience of the Gusties.
however, eventually prevailed in the
latter stages of the ﬁrst half when
they scored to go on top. 1-0, which
ended up being the ﬁnal margin.

“We were mentally and physically
prepared. but we were just
outmatched.“ commented Coach
Jenny Wood. “This game was a
great test for us and our defense did
an outstanding job. Gustavus was
physically superior to us in that they

were very strong and quick, and had
disciplined skills. Despite the loss,
however, a lot of good came out of
this game because we were not ten-
tative and we played hard," Wood
remarked.

Going into Sunday’s game against
Macalester, the Pioneers were

physically spent from the exhaust-
ing game the day before. This was
evident in the ﬁnal 7~0 score. “Our
players were just too fatigued from
the game Saturday," said Wood.
“We played to the best of our abil-
ity, but Macalester was superb at

finishing and their crosses quickly
wore us down," Despite the nega— ‘
tive outcome. there were positive
signs according to Wood. “1 was
impressed with the way that we
were able to hang in the match and _
not give up," she said. “Further- .
more, 1 was pleased with the con-
tributions that the first-year players

made. They really showed that they
could come in and back up their

teammates."

Now the Pioneers are focusing on
taking what they have learned from
the Minnesota trip and applying it
to their upcoming games. “Over—
all, that trip was extremely posi
tive,“ commented Wood. “We just'
have to maintain confidence and
take care of ourselves as we head,
toward the end of the season," she“
concluded. The Pioneers‘ next
match will take place tomorrow at
1:00 against St. Mary’s.

Male harrters have not placed in top ﬁve since ‘92

Sports Information Office

This Saturday the Grinnell College
men‘s cross country team hopes to
ﬁnish near the top as it hosts the Les
Duke Invitational. The 34th annual
event, which features about 20
teams. begins at 10:00 with the
women’s race followed by the
men's contest at 10:45. The races
are at Oakland Acres golf course
west of Grinnell on Highway 6.
”As usual, we have a very good
field with a lot of teams," com-
mented Coach Will Freeman. “De-
fending Les Duke champion
Carleton is Joined by Washington
University. Luther and Augustana,
all nationally ranked. If we could
squeeze in between some of those
teams, I think it would be a good
showtng." The Pioneers have not
finished among the top five at Les
Duke since 1992 when they were
third.
Last weekend the harriers showed
their potential By placing seventh at

the talent-laden Luther All-Ameri-
can meet. UW-LaCrosse won the
meet with 31 points. Augustana
was second at 65 While St. Thomas
edged Luther, 136-141, for third.
St. Olafwas fifth With 152 and UW-
Whitewater nipped Grinnell, 165-
169, for sixth.

Freeman noted, “I‘m excited
about our finish because we did it
without our No. 2 runner Josh
Ward. With him out score would
have been significantly better. I
think we could be among the top
teams in our NCAA region."

Sophomore Neil Gipson showed
his potential by racing to ninth
place in a time of 20:40. “Neil is a
real competitor. He is clearly de-
veloping into afine runner," offered
Freeman. Junior Kevin Notheis
placed 25th in a time of21:10 while
senior Andy Nassiff clocked a
21:17 for 29th place. Rookies Dan
Madigan, Andy Nelson and Matt
Prekker finished 401h, 66th and
77th. “After Gipson our next three

runners werejust 19 seconds apart."
noted Freeman.

Senior Bryan Rebar posted the
team’s seventh-best time. but he ran
it in thejunior varsity race. Almost
the entire team improved their
times from the marks set at the
Cornell Ram Run the previous
week. Coach Freeman noted the
performances of Kentner
Cottingham. Matt Rhoads and Ben
Chiri. All three runners cut at least
1:45 off their times. Freeman also
noted the runs turned in by Mike
Johnson and Jared Becker.

“What I really like about our team
is the way everyone is competing.
They are challenging themselves to
be better. The improvement in
times this week is a great sign,"
analyzed Freeman.

”Our meet this weekend is our
first five-mile race of the season. I
think the hilly terrain at Oakland
Acres may offer the most difficult
course we’ll see this fall,“ judged
Freeman

Sports Information Office

Another test against a good Mid-
west Conference opponent awaits
the Grinnell College women's
tennis team when it hosts Beloit
this Sunday at 10:00.

Last weekend the Pioneers
pushed their dual-meet record to
3-2 with 5-4 Wins over Lawrence
and St. Norbert. The netwomen
fell to Ripon, 7-2.

“1 was really pleased with our
pcrformance,"commented Coach
David Arsencault, “We were go-
ing against three of the better
teams in the conference and our
players were not intimidated at
all We played very tough tennis
and overall 1 think wc-playcd
great."

Friday against Ripon the victo-
ries came at No. 2 doubles from
Kim Knous and Aime Hopper and
at No. 4 singles from Knous.
“Kim and Aime were a great duo
all weekend." noted the coach.
Two of the losses at the other po-
sitions were three-set matches

In the victory over Lawrence on
Saturday Amy Kaufman got the
team started Willi a victory at No.
1 singles. Hopper was victorious
at No. 2 singles while Beth Dadko
and Cynthia Robbins also won at
No, 3 and 5 singles. Knous and
Hopper sealed the victory with a
win at No. 2 doubles.

Against St. Norbert Kaufman
fell to the defending conference
champion in three sets. “It was
great to see Amy get a set and

play very well in the other two. I
think this will do a lot for her con-
fidence," said Arseneualt.

The victories in singles came
from Hopper, Dadko. Robbins
and Heather Korte, who played
No. 6. Knous fell at No. 4 in a
three-set match but teamed with
Hopper at No.2 doubles to earn

the conference race will be tight
with the three opponents Grinnell
played last weekend, plus Beluit
and Coe. “Eeloit is another im-
portant match for us," he noted.

from this young team. They are
‘tun to be with, are competitive
and have great camaraderie," con-
cluded Arseneault.
