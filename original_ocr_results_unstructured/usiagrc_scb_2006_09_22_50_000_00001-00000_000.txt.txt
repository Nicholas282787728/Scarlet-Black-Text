When Theatre majors began arriving back in
Grinnell this August, many of them went straight
to the ofﬁce of Pip Gordon, a favorite professor, for
words of advice. But instead of their professor, all they
found was a whiteboard full of“Pip—ismsr”

wrotc to her “Grinncll family." ”When theatre isn’t
fun any more—get out orit."

abruptly and moved to Mississippi to devote her life
to writing and a newly rounded construction cernpan
ny. Her resrgnanon was a srrrprise to her advisees, the
first-years assigned to her tutorial and the members of
her Introduction to Sragecraft class.

Her stagecmtt class was cancelled. students in
her tutorial were assigned to Laura Srnnctt, Psychol-
ogy, for a new tutorial Tire Theatre department is

with dark clouds promising rarn later that afternoon. The Demon

How we ended up with Out Takes in the Grille

3v JULIA BOTTLES & TJ. HAWLEY

Alex Brooks '03 walked rate a meeting ofthc Dmrng Services
committee prepared to fight for Grab &Go. When he walked out,
he felt like he had won the battle: Grab do Go would be included
in the new Joseph R Roscnfrcld '25 Campus center. But within a
month, Crab 8; Go had been vetoed and replaced by a new program,
Out Takes, with fewer options and more restricted hours.

Tire design for the campus Center was drawn up before orah
do Go was created in 2003, so included no space for the program
Furthermore, while the college was doing more detailed planning
for the building, outside consultants recommended that the college
eliminate Grab 23c Go.

During the only months oflast school year, Brooks and former

SGA Presidentlohn Bohinan '06 realized that Grab SLGo was not
in the Campus Center plans, A suhcommirrcc ortire two and Din—
ing services Director DickWilliams proposed housing Grab &Go
in a second floor private dining room to Osgood.

"We walked out orthat meeting feeling like Osgood said that he
was in support ofhaving a Grab 8c Go. Lookrng [back] at the Dine

ing Service Committee notes, it looks a little different than it was,"

sard Brooks, admitting that perhaps ire and Bohmrn irnti mrsinrcra
preted support {or a meal replacement plan.

The proposal was r y th(|.erliirms was asked to come up with
a secontlproposal locating Grab 3e Go in the Grille area. Brooks
