PAS/Duke Invitational runs this weekend

by Kate Hughes

Grinnell College hosts the annual
Les Duke Invitational on Saturday.
This cross country meet should draw
500400 athletes from high schools and
colleges. Beginning at 9:50, the high
school students will race, and at 11:30,
the college women will start, followed
by the men at 12:15 pm.

Les Duke was a lormer graduate,
athlete, and coach at Grinnell College.
He was part of the Grinnell communi-
ty from 1920 to the 19405, at which
time he was not only a coach, but the
athletic director. and dean of men. In
those days, cross country did not ex-
ist, but for his work in track and field,
theicollege, {or the past 20 years, has
held an annual cross country meet in
his honor.

Les Duke made some significant
contributions to the college. He was an
early advocate of athletics at Grinnell
and coached several outstanding
athletes, both on the Olympic and na-
tional level. Morgan Taylor, a Grinnell
graduate who went on to become an
Olympic champion, was trained by
Duke, as was national champion,
Leonard Paul.

Coach Ray Obermiller, the mens'
cross country coach, has been involv-
ed in this invitational for the last 14
years. Thirteen or 14 teams are ex-

pected to compete in the mens’ race.

Last year, Grinnell {inished iourth,
but this year’s team looks stronger
and has a gond shot at finishing in the
third spot. Luther and Central, he
predicts, will be the top contenders for
the crown, as they were last year.

Grinnell’s number one runner, Terry
Drew, has a good Chance to fare well
in this race, followed by Dave Cook in
the number two position. Dick Gilbert
is presently running in the number
three position. Roger Sayre, Kevin
Koy, Brian Takeguohi, Steve Pfarrer,
and Charlie Rekully round out the top
eight positions.

The womens’ team hopes to place in
the top live, out or about ten teams,
providing Ruth Raich and Toni
Heiman will be able to run. Heiman is
recovering from a stress fracture and
has yet to compete this year. haieh is
coming off of an injury as well.

Coach Mary Ann Pankey is not sure
whether the women will do as well as
last year because of the lack of eXr
perience and depth in her young team.
However, she is optimistic, especially
about Julia Carver, who has an ex-
cellent shot at one of the top five
places. She is in supurb condition and
could possibly win the crown if she
can overcome her fierce competitors
from Luther and Central. Pankey feels
