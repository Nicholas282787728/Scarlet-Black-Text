Hats off to
community service

Members of Grinnell’s Mortar Board society, a
national honor society which recognizes college see
niors for distinguished ability and achievement in
scholarship, are working on an outreach project.

“The theme this year for the national organiza-
Lion is Reading is Leading, a literacy project," Katie
Kiskaddon, a Mortar Board member, said.

Each year, local Mortar Board chapters try to int
tegtate the national theme into their individual events
and activities.

Grinnell members are implementing this theme
by providing an impoverished rural school in the
Eastern Cape of South Africa with school supplies.
The school is first through seventh grade, and has
very few supplies because they have limited access to
government funding due to their location,

“The group tried to do something last year with
another school in South Africa, but it didn’t work
out, so we found another school this year,” Kiskad—
don said.

The group is looking for donations such as chilt
dren’s books in English, school supplies, literacyeree
lated supplies or monetary donations.

“school supplies are less orpensive in south Ar-
rica than in the United States, so money donations
will potentially buy more there, but we’re accepting
any kind of donations," Kiskaddon said.”

it can also be designated for a speciﬁc purpose
that is not feasible to donate, such as bookshelves,
chalkboards or window panes. '

Those interested can drop off donations with
Amy Graves, coordinator of the community service
center, on Park Street, Donations will not be sent u”,
til spring.

Mortor Board as a community service organizat
tion dates back to I918,when the national societywas
established. Their motto is represented by the Greek
letters Pi, Sigma and Alpha, representing service,
scholarship and leadership,

On Wednesday night, Mary Meehan, sponsored by the Grins
nell ProtLife Group, spoke on “Why Liberals Should Defend the
Unborn." She gave some history and information about groups that
defend pro—life stance on abortion but also liberal is-
sues, such as Feminists for Life and Democrats for
Life, A selftdcscribcd "protlifc feminist,” and
freelance reporter, Meehan advocates actively
against abortion, euthanasia, eugenics and war.
She believes that the pro-life movement should
be more diverse and include more Liberals.
over so people attended the talk in Hatis
Concert Hall, which began at 7 pm. Question
ing continued until 10 pm. Before her talk, the

' seal; asked he: a few questions.

Q: What made you want to he an attim wit:
ﬁn this imle?

A:I was very active in the antitwat movement in the 1960s and
70s. l was puzzled when so many people who were in the anti-
war movement, including people who I knew and respected, moved
without much question to the abortion choice side, It seemed to me
that there was a conﬂict there because I thought we were against
the war in large part because of the terrible violence and the taking
of human life involved. I thought “Wait a minute! People should
look at this more closely,” So, I looked and listened and read a fair
amount and when I was ready to write,l did some research includ
ing looking at embryology books and it seems to me that the scien-
tiﬁc evidence that life begins at conception is just overwhelming. I
think they make a very strong pro-lite case based on human rights
and that is what I started to do,

Q: What (loyal: thin/t Lt the biggest lime in the abortion dell/ate?

A: Human rights, because those rights are indiVisible. If the
rights in any human beings are threatened, in a sense everyone else’s
rights are threatened. The unborn are the most defenseless form of
life, if anything we should defend them more. I think that all life and
death issues are very important and I'm an advocate ofa consistent
life ethic which consistently opposes the violence and the taking of
human life across the world. So I am against war, the death penalty,
euthanasia as well as abortion.

Q:Iflzbnm'on ’u a human rights issue, wouldyou ray that aPPoSir
tion to it it not or should not he izylutnted by religion?

A: I think the big presence of the Right has turned it in many
people‘s eyes into a religious issue. And, if we look at most or the
great social change movements in our history, most of them have
been led by religious people. Although in most cases you could make

a strong case on human rights grounds, religious people tended to be

in the leadership positions.Thar was true for the antieslavery move

ment, where the (bakers were involved or the struggle against segt

regation in the south, which was squarely rooted

“mum: in the black churches. I think when looking at

the pro-life movement, people should keep in

mind that religious leadership is not unusual in

social change, At least in this country, that is
the usual situation,

Q: Why do you think many people who/tel
rmngly about other Immtm riglllr irrues do not
fed the ram way about this one? Why do you
think many people do not instinctively feel that
ahortton it homicide, the wayprnJifepenple do?

A: I think there has been a studied effort on
the part of many of the supporters of abortion to use
language to evade the reality of what happens and that has been
successful to a large degree. Abortion is often referred to as "ter-
mination”, the unborn are referred to as “products of conception."
There has been a conscious effort not to use “unborn child," which
is an old and respectable way to call the unborn. Instead, “fetus" is
the word used, which de-humanizes i rhmk population control
was the major moving force for the leg zation of abortion in this
countryThere was a good deal ofmoney and power behind it in the
1970s for reasons of population control and it is still true today If
you look at the big foundations that are funding major groups sup
porting abortion, most of these foundations are heavily inﬂuenced
by population control. Of course, they don’t put it front and center,
they talk about women's rights and choice instead. There is still a
major eugenics inﬂuence too, ifyou look at major population control
groups like Planned Parenthood or the Population Council, most
of them have been started by eugenicists, back in the 20s, 30s, 40s.
...The eugenicists tended to have racial bias, class bias, bias against
people with disabilities and held a terribly paternalistic view. It is a
terrible attitude.

Q: Sn,yllll think the abortion dell/It: tr more a mamﬁrtation llfin-
rtl'tutl'onlzl interest: than it is Ii [Imbing tszuriedptrronaI beliefs?

A: I don’t want to sound too cynical but I don't think the folks
at population control really care about individual womenl think
they tend to manipulate people. And sure there are many personal
beliefs but I plead with people to take a look at the scientific facts
here about embryonic and fetal development and to realize that we
all ourselves went through that stage. We all started as a period at
the end ofa sentence, which is phenomenal.
