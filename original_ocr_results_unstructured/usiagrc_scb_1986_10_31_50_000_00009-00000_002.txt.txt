more having to accept 75% of all ape

Continuing eflorts to revitalize pro-

nout and to promote a “truly liberal arts
education." the administration announced

, this week that professors will be put on a
rotating department schedule.

“We want to show that a true liberal arts

tained the Ph.D.. " Catherine Frazer,
Dean of the Faculty, is reported to have
said.

Similar to current student discipline re-
quirements. professors can now teach only
three courses in any one division per
semester. For example, a political science
professor may teach only three courses in
the Humanities DiviSlon, only two of which
may be in any single department.

Effective as of next semester, the ads
ministration has already announced some
of the new schedules.

Ira Strauber. Associale Professor of

in a statement issued over break. Grins
nell College President George Drake an-
nounced that, once again. the' college will
be changing its logo. This move is being
made, in part. as a response to the over
\vhelmlngly negative response by the stu-
dent body to the logo introduced at the
beginning of the semester. “Our students
were dissatisfied. We saw the need to
make a change it’s as Simple as that,"
said Drake in an interview earlier this
week. ’

The “bar-type" logo introduced earlier
this year has received Wide-spread
criticism for the heavy bar which looms
over the Grinnell name. This aspect of the
design has caused the logo to become
known as the “Bar Logo" and, as a conse-
quence, has caused Grinnell to become
known as the "Bar College,” an image
Drake finds inconSlstent with the college's

‘ new alcohol policy. “The Bar Logo had a
deiinite advantage in its ability to attract
students." said Drake. “Students want to
come to a college like Grinnell which has a
good blend of liberal arts and liberal drinks
ing. It's a good logo; unfortunately. the
state of Iowa changed its drinking laws
shortly after the institution of the logo. Our
lawyers advised us that we could be sued
for false advertising if the Bar Logo were
kept.” Grinnell's legal consultant, in an
off-the-recorcl Comment, said that the col~
lege also could have run into some legal
difficulties because the logo is so
aesthetically unpalatable. “Iowa has strict
laws against ugliness in advertising. The
Bar Logo violates 98% of them."

The new logo. which will be formally
unveiled today, depicts a dead horse.
"Other logos have been ambiguous. open
to interpretation. We have fixed that pro
blem with this logo," said Drake. Drake
explained the logo. saying that "the still
outstretched legs of the horse give the logo
stability The dead. sexless horse |S used to
symbolize Grinnell's policy of non-
discrimination on the bases of sex, species,

Cheerleading Will be introduced on the
Grinnell campus beginning with the spring
1937 Sports season, the athletic departmenl
announced this week. »

The department was quick to point out
that although the money for the new activi-
ty came from funds formerly used tor
Women’s Field Hockey, this does not
reflect any sexism on the part oi me
department.

In keeping with the liberal policies of the
college, “The Cheer Squad will be open to

both males and females,” athletic dierec-
tor Dee Fairchild Said.

The unisex uniform will consist of a
black sweatshirt emblozoned with the new
college logo in red across the front, a pair
of contrasting red lame shorLs, and red
and white saddle shoes.

The decision to begin Cheerleading as an
elective was based on a survey conducted
by Professor Kent McClelland’s sociology
classes. The survey concluded that 35% of
the coaches feel cheerleading would boost

morale and. consequently, players‘ perfor~
mances.

Auditions for would-be Pioneer Pom-
Pom Persons will be conducted in ﬁle
beginning of December. Copies of the
pheersand routines will be on file in Burl-
ing Library. The department's press
release stresses that all students are eligi-
ble to try out and that Grinnell especially
encourages women and minority can-
didates to apply.

Faculty and students are invited to the
