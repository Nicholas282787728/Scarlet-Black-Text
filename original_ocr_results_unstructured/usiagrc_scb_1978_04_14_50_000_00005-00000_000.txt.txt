By request: “happy” movies

There were so many letters after
this reporter did his listing oi great
Science Fiction movies, that he
was forced to write another
column.

Thousands of readers voiced the
opinion that they wanted to see a
list of “happy" movies: mowes
that the whole family would love,
One woman wrote, “I am a
housewde and a mother of three
minotaurs, and it seems I can't
lake them to any movies these
days. With all that sex, violence
and puppetry, [don't know what to
bring them to see. Please write and
make up my mind for me.”

Well Mrs. X, for you and all the
Greeks at PS. 27, this week’s
column is devoted to “Happy
Movies.“ movies guaranteed to
evoke no emotion from the
audience.

People must begin to look at

A unified mankind seems like an}
impossible condition to ever come
about. but in Mathew 21 Ver. 21-22
Jesus said to‘his disciples, . . ii
you have faith and never doubt , . ,
even if you say to this mountain,
'Be taken up and cast into the sea,’
it will be done,” Surely if it is
possible to command a mountain to
cast itself into the sea then it is
possible {or people to feel a oneness
with each other. Furthermore, in
Mathew 23 Ver. 40, Jesus Said the
second highest commandement is
"You shall love your neighbor as
yourself," which further ems
phasizes the importance oi
brotherhood

The first step in creating an

their hearts when that hand is
slapped because progress towards
a better society depends on per
