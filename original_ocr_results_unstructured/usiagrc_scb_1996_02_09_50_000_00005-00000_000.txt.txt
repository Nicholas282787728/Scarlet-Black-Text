Have you lost your reality?

weeks, I have received updates from
the Career Development Office, the
Volunteer Organization, Computer
Services, and the Theater Departe
rnent. I soon expect the same from
[<ch and SGA. (It isestimated that
if every newsletter printed and sent
out tostudents this yearwassttetched
from end to end, it would Circle the
campus 437 times.) ldon’r want to

 

imply that these things are useless —
I am a strong proponent of informa
tion, especially if it contains refer—
ences to cereal, Publications like the
"QC Gazette" have filled the gaping
holes in my lite; I feel whole now,
knowing the innermost thoughts and
feelings of that intriguing and enig-
matie character known as Dave Mc—
Connell. I like Enya, too.

Some might consider this infor—
mation silly. Not me. I think it’s a
great idea to send us questionnaires
and surveys so they can sift through it
and send us another newsletter With
all their findings. Just this week I
received requests ”tell us your Views
on the math department as a non—
major," and "let us know how we can
improve the college bookstore." I
know that I will find it worthwhile to
takejustafew momentsofmytimeto
proVide important information for
Those Who Care.

At times, of course. this deluge
of really vital information makes me
wish for simpler times. I fondly re—
membet the halcyondaysofmyyouth
when I waited all afternoon for the
coveted 15 minute breakwhen I could
hang out with my friends and drink
apple jutce in four ounce portions.
Then the teachers would corral us
back into the team where we would
all fall asleep until cIass ended. (Oh.
wait What am I talking about? I’m
describing Interim.)

Okay. so maybe I don’t: have
any Concept of Reality. Perhaps I’m
a little warped to be. more concerned
about the fat content in the gua—
camole layer salad than about Bob
Dale‘s election campaign. But then
again, maybe I‘d be more interested if
I knew his thoughts on Enya.
