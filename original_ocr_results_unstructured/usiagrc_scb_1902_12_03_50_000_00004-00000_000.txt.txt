THE GRINNELL GREENHOUSE

 

PERSIAN GARDEN AND ORGAN
RECITAL.

The program given in the chap.
el Tuesday night before Thanks
giving was one of the most intere

estingwhich has been heard in
Grinnell for some time. It had
a peculiar interest in being ~Mr.
Matlaclt's ﬁrst organ recital and
also the occasion [or opening the
new Steinway piano. Mr. Mate
hick executed sonic grand pieces.
among them thcuell known Gtitltl
[Ttirilty Spell. from l’nrsrldl, [lo
we sistcti by hllss now. who

'mpatlletic anti altogether tnnsic

consisting of Miss Botelle, l\lt's.
Heidel. Mr. Condit anti Mr. Olds.
The ﬁrst hearing of this work al
ways makes a prolound impress
ion. and when it receives the serir
ous study that our singers had
givenit, the effect amounts al-
most to a revelation. In both the
individual numbers and the en-
semble the {act ivas apparent to
every listener that the singers
were alive totlie meaning of their
work. and beyond a doubt the
work was really interpreted in a
manner worthy of almost any
quartettc in theland. The piano
lorte part or it as played by Mr.
Smith was entirely beyond critic
cisrn. liilﬁlling every requirement
or agood accompaniment. being
at all times perfectly in accoicl
with the singers. and at the same
time lull ot individuality and mu.
sieal reeling.

No better instance of the iCllt~
argy toward musical matters which
pervadest he college could be de-
sired than the attendance at this
concert shows. Less than orie-
halfthe faculty. and about one
tourth of the students were pres-

a

Less than onerhalfthe amount re
quired to pay lor the new hymn-
books was raised.

oi that city and won a l ' id game

a strong game while Rule tor
Des Memes was a last, heady
player. Grinnell excelled inteani
work. and her work in this re
spect was remarkable tora team
which has only played together a
few times. The outlook for the
season is bright. Although all
the men on the team except Cap»
tain Wilson and Cole are new to
the ’Varsity. they are showing up
welland ifa corresponding im-
provement is inadcin the next
few weeks a very strong team
will represent the college in the
winter's games.

BASKET BALL.

(Cominnud [min First l‘ngu.)
withthe right spiiit there is no
reason why this branch of ath»
letics should not be as much of a
success in Ion-a college as any
other,

ltniiglit be added that Grin»
nell plays her second game or
the season with the Central Unlr
versltyteam of l’ella atthe men’s
gymnasium, Saturday afternoon.
Iowa College should be well
represented among the meters
in the gallery. A leiv men have
been hard at work forsome weeks
and the game with Fella is ex-
pected to be close.
