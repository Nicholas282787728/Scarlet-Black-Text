A NOBLE EXCEPTION

“The evil that men do lives lifter them; -

The good is oft interred with their bones."
ishakespeare.

During the past month, many of us
have had the privilege of seeing and hear-
ing a man whose life and action is at noble
exception to the thought expressed in these
lines of Shakespeare.

The good that Mr. ArnoldeFoi'ster has
done, is doing, and will do, cannot help but
‘live after’ him. We may not have agreed
with everything this man has said here, and
we will of course forget much of what he
did say; but we cannot forget the sincerity
with which he advanced his arguments, we
cannot forget the MAN and all that his life
and work bear testimony of.

Mr. ArnoldrForster has done more than
make friends on this campus; he has done
more than merely impress 1.15 with his al-
most unbelievable knowledge of men and
affairs; he has done more than renew our
devotion to peace and justice; he has left
upon our minds the indellible impression
that here is a man whose very life is a tri-
bute to all that is good, of all that is unsel»
fish, to all that El. man CAN do to leave
something of immortality behind him when
he leaves this complex life.

To the anonymous Grinnell friend of
peace who brought this noted man to our
campus, our sincere gratitude and apprecia-
tion. To Charles Payne, our increased ad»
miration for his part in securing for us the
opportunity of meeting this noted Briton.
And to Mr. Arnold—Forster himself, our un-
speakable and undying respect and devotion,
for himself and for the cause which he has
so sincerely and confidently advanced

—Bcnnett L. Brink.

NINE MEN AND A CLOCK
(Daily Orange)

The routine of those “Nine Old Men" has been
interrupted by Time. Seventy, in years, has sud-
denly become a meaningful numbe» The quiet
and sobriety of the black-gawned justices in the
white background of the supreme coult building
suddenly has been disturbed. Will time and age

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

limit or hinder their Service?

That is the distracting question.

in the midst of all the Time-turmoil, a hand-
some and historic clock, unheedful of any “70"
limitation, serenely ticked out its 100th year.

Presented as s gift to Andrew Jackson by a
skilled 85eyear-old Connecticut clockemsker, who
designed the two-feet-wide white dial and beautir
fully wrought bronze frnme, the timepiece has
continued faithfully to serve the court. Increas—
ing age hes degraded its position. From the con-
gressional law library the old clock was promoted
to the justices' roblug room, demoted to the court
clerk‘s office and finally relegated to a basement
file room, But bearing no grievances for its loss
of prestige, the old clock has continued to strike
the hours through the century.

Minutes, months, days and decades, the old clock
has ticked away, “Seventy” has long been passed
without a care or worry. Though supplanted by
newer, more modem time-keepers, the old clock
still ticks on, smiling perhaps at the contrast in
its own security and that of the “Old Nine Men,"

FREEDOM or" SPEECH
lThe Volantel

The chief topic of callvclsdtloll in all walks of
life is President Roosevelt‘s plnn cf l'uolg’anizlllg
the federal judiciary. It is discussed finnldy by
the people of this country, by those who izivor it
and by those who nppose it.

Such frank cxiticism of thc chief executive
would he unthinkable in many foreign countries.
What would happen to the person in Germany who
would dnrc to cr‘ cise a plan cdvnnccd by Hitler?
tht would happen to the ltalicn who would dare
to criticise Mussolini? What would take place if
someone in Russia cr scd Stalin? The hnswel‘,
in all instances, is that such a brave person would
soon be facing a firing squad or something worse,
That is the method dictators use in disposing of
their enemies and opponents.

Trials of the accused persons are usually a
farce or so peremptory as to be a waste of tune
for all concerned. Newspapers frequently carry
stories of killings by the firing squads of Stalin
Only recently the newspapers reported the who
sale murder of nearly 600 Ethiopians by Mussolini's
soldiers.

Surely few will doubt that the American way,
democracy, IS the best. A (rank, thorough discus~
sion of our problems is the only method of solving
them pcnnaneutly. Democracy may fail in at few
instances, but the United Stctes hes becn a mag-
nificent success.

“H
is THERE AN AVSVVER?
(Coe College Cosmos)

College students are often confused by the
opposing philosophies to which they are exposed
in their various classes, They find natural and
Social Sciences at first bewildering- in their differ
ing viewpoint Natural science has been wont to
accept the idea of causation. Social science is
more sure that causation may post he considered
as a degree of probability.

Bible classes in their turn offer is theological
explanation. They post a divine power as a Gas-
ual factor. yct few theologians would likely blame
great natural disturbances such as floods, droughts,
tornadoes, and earthquakes on an enraged Deity.
That a Great Being wields an extensive influence
on mankind however, they are certain.

With students thus already in a glon'ous mudr
die, the admission by President Robert Maynard
Hutchins of the University of Chicago, that science
must recognize the metaphysical simply because
some natural phenomena occur apparently un—
ceused, does not help the situation.

Our bewildered student may gain some con-
solation in the notion that colleges do not have the
enswers. They do not pretend to have them. A
college student does have an opportunity to become
acquainted with the various explanations consider-
ed to have some room by these men who have der
voted their lives to study.

In the end, each man must develop his own
philosophy. He may end up with practically the
same ideas he has had before, but he will have
clarified them by a consideration of these other
cxplanatiom.

Although the college student cannot expect to
learn this much longed for answer, he can learn
techniques and methods that will aid him in El.
fuller, happier, and more comfortable life.

“At times we have been criticized for allowing
radicals to speck on our platformsibilt we still let
them speak. After they speak our students and
faculty members discuss their speeches in class-
rooms end often many worthwhile ideas, both pro
and can, evolve from such discussion." Dr. George
Barton Cutten, president of Colgate university, re
fuses to put a. prefcrcutial-pcdlock on the Speaker's
platform.

“The hest which instructors at school can do iS
give you the best information you can o’btain, but
you have to picture for yourself what you will do
in li[e, and with the use of this informnti '
struggle along these lines towards ncqui
specific knowledge," Charles Kettering, president
of the General Motors Research laboratories, mgr
gests s specific line to struggle along.

‘Spring Dance’

Proves Popular With Audience

Large Number of Curtain
Calls Received
by Cast

BY CARL NIEMEYER

The unprecedented number of
curtnm calls given the cost of
“Spid‘ng Dnnce" at its first Grin—
nell performance on Thursday
night was a good indication of
what the college audience thought
of the college play. The applause
wns both genuine and deserved,
[or the listeners had had the
pleasure of seeing themselves in-
terpreted on the stage, and the
actors had had the pleasule of be-
ing collegizl e in public and under
the super on of the chemo do-
pnrtmeut.

The most amusing players were
those who frankly enjoyed them-
selves and got as much fun out
of the comedy as did the and
ience. Notable was Katherine
RollndS, who, with her ability to
make even an ordinary telephone
conversation seem funny, stole the
show. Along with her Emmy
Lou Grouch, Sally Hamilton, and
Doris Johnson made the comedy
of the play so good that one was
inclined to forget the romantic
love Story which passed for a
plot, Not that Miss Strcebelc and
Mr, Tullls were not satisfactory
us the loving heroine and the
half reluctant hero, but theirs
were plainly not the parts which

Women Prove
Better Students
Here Than Men

Men may be the stronger sex
physically, but that doeSn't go
mentally. At least not accord—
ing to the records released by the
registrar’s office this week, which
showed that of 34 students get-
ting nt least nine hours of A, 20
were women, and 14 were men.

The records, compiled from
first semester grade averages,
showed further that the men
failed to dominate in any of the
four college classes considered.
Among the seniors, the women
led five to four; in the juniors, the
feminine sex predominated seven
to four; while in the sophomore
and freshman clasSes, the margin
was six to five, and two to one
respectively.

Nine Seniors

Nine seniors compiled records of
at least nine hours of A, as did 11
juniors, 11 sophomores, and three
freshmen.

The complete list of students
receiving at least nine hours of A
is as follows: seniors—Robertson

ces Hansen, Pauline KruSe, Ruth

garet Thompson.

COLLEGIATE REVIEW

Living expenses at the women's
coop dormitories of Pennsylvania
State college have been slashed to
a new low of $5.25 per week for
each coned, reports Charlotte E.
Ray, dean of women.

 

the author had written with me

So for the reader may have the
impression that “Spring Dance"
is a woman's play, and so indeed
it is; but one or two of the men
in the cost had a chance to do

lege boy than like a Yale man.
acted with nonchnlance; and Rus-
sell Boneguldi (“the man is a
monster," exclaims Miss crouch
in the second act} did well the
part of the undergraduate cynic.

All the players, in fact, read
their lines with a spirit which
compensated for the absence of
professional finish, For example,
one often wished that the emin-
Clntion were clearer and the voic-
es less mid-Western, and that
some of the plnyers would wait
for the audience to stop laughing
before they went on to the next
line; but these were minor flaws
in a production for which Carl
Johnson and the cast must get
much credit.

Mystery Tales
Prove Popular
With Faculty

BY ELIZABETH LYMAN

“The corpse icy huddled in the
rain. From his chest protruded a
garden knife." Thai. sounds like a
thriller or rll eat my winter un~
derwesr.

We looked up the story's popu-
larity record on the rental card,
and found listed Professors Seivcr,
strong, Laval], Peck, Norton, and
undergraduate Baxter smith. And
all the other gruesome mysteries
appeared to he just as popular
with these same professors and
undergraduate Smith.

Strong Holds ncooril

prof. Strong held the record for
the amount of mystery stories
read. When cornered after class,
he seemed rather on the defensive,
“1 take a lot of them out for my
wife," he explained, but he did ad-
mit c liking for mystery stories.
“They're a good way to forget
your worries." Mr. strong doesn't
know what his favorites are; he
cun never remember die titles.
“But I do like them bloody," he
added. “It’s horribly disappoint-
ing to have less than four mur-
ders."

Mr. Norton likes action and at
least five mul‘ders,—no sissy m-
mnntic stuff or dull court room
scenes for him. Mysteries appeal
to him because the plots are so
easily forgotten.

Litvell Likes Thrillers

“Thrillers and murders? Sure, I
like them," chuckled Mr. Lavell.
"Always have." Murders and
clime are all in the game, and
the more the better. “But some.
times,” Says Mr. Lavell, ”they kill
the wrong people, Carolyn Wells,
for instance, That's horrible."

Mr. Lavcll likes mystery stories
for their characters. He wants
the sleuths and leading characters
to be real people, agreeable and
full of zip, and able to do. every-
thing he can't do. He recommends
Austin Freeman's "Pontifcx, Son,
and Thorndyke," a story with
real lie-men,

Murder Falls

Mr. Seiver has long had a repu-
tation in the rental library as a
murder fan, but he takes them all
out for his wife. “I don’t like
mysteries," he said. “They are all
alike,"

We couldn’t obtain interviews
with Prof. Peck and student
Smith. Perhaps they were too ab-
sorbed with “The Man who Mur-
dered Himself," or “The Corpse
With the Dirty Face.”
