Scoring 806 points, the Grill—
llell basketball team of 1938»

1939 amassed the largest num-
ber of points in one season in
the history of the school. The
Pioneers, who finished in a tie
for third with Tulsa in the Mis-.
souri Valley conference, also broke
more individual and team records
than any time before.

Wilbur Luick, center, led the
individual record breakers when
he scored 167 points to break Fred
Luther's modern scoring record of
153 points, which was established
last year.

New TlireeeYEidr lteoord.

Luick established a new three
year scoring record when his to-
tal amounted to 396 points. Frank
Duncan was the former holder of
the record with 367 points.

By scoring 20 points in the st.
LouiSvGrinnell game at st. Louis,
Feb. 20, Luick added a third blue
ribbon to his collection when he
established a new modern single
game scoring record.

Sets New Sophomore Mark.

Jerry Fort, forward, scored 161
times to set a new modern soph-
more scoring mark.

By accumulating a total of 709
minutes, Capt, Robert Berry play-
ed more basketball in one season
than any other player in the his-
tory of the sport at Grinnell.

John Turner, guard, was close
behind Berry with 695 minutes.

Turner also set a record of per»
centage of free throws made.

In winning fourteen games and
losing only seven for a percentage
of .667, the Pioneers also had the
best season won and lost average
for 25 years.

Average Score is 38.4.

The average score, 334 points
per game. was the highest since
1904.

The reason for the onslaught of
records by the basketball team of
1933739 is probably due to the
fact that the 211mm: schedule in-
cluded more games than any oth-
er year, another ecord to be add-
ed in the annals of Grinnell itth~
