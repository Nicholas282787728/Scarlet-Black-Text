Drama in French

“Dans Up Ascendeur,“ a French
play will be given Monday evening at
8:15 in the auditorium of A. n. H.
under the direction of Martha Miller.
Everyone interested is invited. The
plot centers around the two members
of the cast, Adreienne, a young wide
Ow, played by Katherine Gillespie and
Robert, which part will be taken by
Walter Secor.

The play takes place in an eleva-
tor which is stuck between two
floors and in which Adrienne and
Robert are riding. The tormer is
greatly agitated and the latter is giw
en many opportunities to calm her.
He takes advantage of his position
to continue his efforts to become
acquainted, and recounts his atten-
tions and her cruelty in returning
her flowers recently.

During this recital sho becomes
more and more freightened and tin-
ally taints. Robert, in his search for
methods to revive her ,finds a (low-
er inclosed in a book. He knows it
to he one that hc has sent her itnd
feels that at last she loves him. Ull‘
on her recovery. he proclaims his
love. Just as this point the eleva-
tor is freed and begins to ascend,
Adrienne reaches her floor and leaves
the car, but Robert has the book
containing the ﬂower for an excuse
to reach her the next day and he
knows that all will be well.

Springfield, lll,, ior duty."

There were a number of personal
letters from Mr. Macy, describing
war experiences, and also a diary. ap-
parcntly written by him. On the twen»
tyrfourtll of December, according to
the diary, year not mentioned: "we
came on a forced march to the city,
dead mules and horses strewn the
whole way. Six miles from town we
passed the outposts of the enemies
works, The enemy had stood the fire
as long as was pleasant. and the: had
fled, leaving their guns."

Finds Commencement Prognnln

At another place in the diary the
army fare was mentioned, hard tack
being stressed. The writer said that
once he purchased half a corn-none
for seventy-five cents, and enjoyed a
luscious feast.

At a later date Mr. Macy writes in
the diary, “I was assigned to the Gen—
eral Hospital ol the 29th. N. c. Mare
tial house, Savannah. Farewell old
loth. Long have I looked forward to
active service, and now the time has
come."

Another interesting relic was a
program for college commencement.
The program was headed: "Iowa Cole
lege, Commencement Week, July
6-18, 1871)." The baccalaureate sere
mop was given by President Mngoun,
and the address before the literary
societies hy Hon. 1. Young Scammon.

Ray Discusses,
Finding Poisons

Tells of Chicago Experiences

Before Audience on
Thursday Night.

How to tell whether a person has
died from poisoning, was Shown by
Mr. F. E. Rny, instructor in the Cheri-k
istry department, at a lecture and
demonstration Thursday evening in
the lecture room of Blair hall, He
showed a group of Grinnell students,
who are preparing for medicine or
lurther chemistry work. how to test
tor arsenic or strychniue in human
blood, and how to tell if death has
been caused from carbon monoxide
poisoning.

The subject of his lecture was
“Toxicology," or the science oi noi-
soning. He traced the art of poisons
ing and the methods ot detecting it,
up through the ages from the earliest
time. Robert Stevenson presided at
the meeting, and a discussion follow-
ed as to how certain poisons act on
people, and how much it takes for a
tatal dose. Dr. 0. F. Parish and Mr,
W, G, Ray attended the meeting as
outside visitors,

Actcll as Chemical Advisor.

Mr. Ray, who formerly was chemi—
cal advisor of the coroner of Cook
county, lliinnis, says he has been
called in many times to test blood
for poisoning from strychnine or ar-
senic. At other times he has had to
prove that a person was not murder-
ed in some such manner, but was ov-
ercome with carbon monoxide poison-
ing from the exhaust of an automo-
bile.

Another duty oi a chemical advisor
is to identify blood stains. One time,
Mr. Ray said, a man in Chicago Was
accused of murder because of some
blood stain sthe authorities found on
his clothing, The blood of a rabbit,
treated for several weeks with ser-
um, reacts, and when put on human
blood. iorms a precipitate. This was
done to the stains on the clothing,
and as no precipitate was formed, the
man's story. that he had gotten the
Mood from a chicken he had killed,
was belelved, and he was released.
