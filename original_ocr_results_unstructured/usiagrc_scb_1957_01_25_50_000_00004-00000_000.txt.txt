‘ Lower Spo’rs l-Toi'ly Conies’red:

———Aihleits
Feat

After having received first
or secondshandedly s e v e r a l
grievances from members of the
varsity wrestling team, and aft—
er having found said grievances
justified. i think it only fair
to extend this writer’s apologies
to those Pioneer stalwarts who
found themselves wronged. Cers
tain of the grapplers felt that
coverage of their sport has been
less than it should have been,
They were wrong, it has been
worse than that. As a matter
of tact. it has been practically
nill!

Neglecting a varsity sport is
unforgivable. Neglecting wrest-
ling is dangerous! It is espes
cially‘ so when the sports edi»
tor weighs in at 165 lbs., and
some of the wrestlers tip the
scales at upwards of 210.

Our reasons for the neglect
are good, or so we feel, Let
me elaborate: the sports staff
regularly consists of myself,
the editor,
son, assistant editor, We never
have enough reporters, and
none which are anything but
partatime writers. “Jake" and
i have no copy staff, headline
staff, proof staff, feature stair,
picture staff, etc, We do all
of these jobs, and much of
the actual reporting for ap-
proximately one-third of the
paper—with no help or pay-
ment for our troubles.

We aren’t asking for mcdals
abut for helptt Two peoplc
can’t do it alone, The sports
section of this paper has always
been good. ”Jake" and i have
tried to make it better. Some
of you guys who are interested
in sports and able to write . . ,
how about giving us a hand7

Today's paper will be the last
one on which i will work as
sports editor, Walt takes over
next weekiand he apparently
has great ambitions for this den
partment, He’ll need new and
good writers.

so, that's it.
hope that this pacifies the
irate elements among the
grapples. I would thoroughly
dislike to be forced to con-
tinue my present policy of
dodging from tree to tree on
my way to classes.

Seriously, now that’ I’ve got
a chance I‘ll say that I've en-
joyed working as your sports
editorﬁnd in saying \“so long,"
wish Walt luck in the-coming
semesters.

Speaking of coach Bob Peters
son's matmen, it should first be
pointed out that they were run-
ners-up to the might of Cornell
in last year's conference meet.
The Pioneers had only a mode
erate record in the regular sea—
son (3-5-1) but more than made
up for this in the loop finale.

This year’s squad is built
around lettemen John Bohan—
mm (123 lbs.) and Marty Hall

(157 lbs.) both third-place
finishers in the canterencci

Time out to wish A1 Sampson
goodbye and good luck and
Lori Delay, the incoming editor,
hello and may the Lord have
mercy on you.

I sincerely

Coe Tops Com“

After nearly two months of
competition, the conference
teams have been separated into
four distinct quarters. Coe’s Ko-
hawks, still undefeated, occupy
the top quarter, safely beyond
reach, for the time being at
least, of the other contestants,
One quarter below is Monmouth
with a record of six and two.

A sextet of schools4ornell,
Knox, Grinnell, Carleton, st.
Olaf and Ripon—crowd the next
quarter, with only a half game
dividing thirdrplace Cornell and
Knox from eighthrplace Ripon.
Securely entrenched in the bot-
tom quarter is still winless Law.
rcnce.

Victories over other iowa
entries enabled the Kohawks

erence Cagers

to stretch their conference
streak to nine games, Except
for the opening minutes when
the Pioneers led briefly, the
Coe-Grinncll game was no
contest. The Kohawks built up
a sixteen point lead-by inter—
mission and maintained it dur—
ing the second half.

With mid—year examinations in
full swing, only two conierenee
games remain for the month of
January: Carleton at St. Olaf on
Tuesday, Monmouth at Cornell
on Thursday. The Northfield
tussle, originally tabbed as a
Carl victory, now appears a
toss-up, The Cornell Rams will
have the homerfloor advantage
as they try to avenge an early
loss to Monmouth.
