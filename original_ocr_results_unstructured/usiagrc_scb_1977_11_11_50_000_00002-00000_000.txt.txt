Canfora emphasizes. K-State
injustices, supports coalition

By Van Tsagaris

Chic Cantora, an eyewitness to’
the Kent State shootings of 1870,
spoke last Tuesday to a group of
Grinnell students about the killings

and the Ohio schools plan to build.

a gym on Blanket Hill.
Caniora‘s main purposes were to
discuss what she felt were in-
justices that had occurred at Kent
State and to drum up support for
the May 4 Coalition, a nation-wide
group of students who seek to
prevent construction ol the gym.
One of her key concerns was the
Presidential decree issued on
Thursday, October 7/3, by Brage
Golding, president oi Kent State
University, which banned all
further demonstrations on the
campus She claimed that this
decree violated the first Amends
ment.

SHE SHOWED slides depicting

Tent City, the community set up on
Blanket Hill over the summer. This
city, according to Canfora, showed
that student power and cooperation .
still exist. '

The present efforts to move the
gym, Canfora thinks, Show that the
student power movement of the
1960's is still active today. “Student
power is not dead; it is more alive
than ever," she said.

Having been a sophomore at the
time of the shooting, she spoke with
a contained, understated bit-
terness about the events of 1970r
She brought up facts not publically
known.

SHE ALSO Cited the successful
blocking of construction of a gym
at Columbia University in the late
1960's as proof that the efforts of
concerned students and the May 4
Coalition would not be wasted,

SHE CHARGED that certain

guardsmen who shot at the
students admitted that their
“mission had been accomplished,"
Furthermore, she claimed that the
Kent State ROTC building, which
burned to the ground the weekend

'bei'ore the shootings, was not set by

students because area firemen
were informed well ahead of time
that there would be a fire at the
building. Finally, she alleged that
a guardsman admitted placing a
gun on the body of a dead student in
order to make it appear as though
the guardsman fired at the
students in self-defense.

In addition to these charges,
Cantora likened the takeover of the
campus by the military to Nazi
Germany. She stated that this
action was so dramatic that even
the most conservative students
protested.

SGA, Student Coordinator’s
office out for blood last week

By Kathy Willhoite

Grinnell students lined up to
donate a pint of blood to the blood
drive sponsored last Thursday and
Friday by the Student Coors
dinator’s Office of SGA.

261 people tried to give blood last
week, and 207 pints were donated.
86 people, or 41.5 per cent of those
who gave blood, were ﬁrst time
donors

The SGA blood drive is affiliated
with the Des Moines Community
blood bank, which services
hospitals in Des Moines and the
surrounding area. According to
Student Coordinator Gary Doem-
hoei’er, Iowa is a “total donor
state.“ Therefore, donors do not
get paid tor their blood.

All donors were served orange
juice, pop or coffee, and cookia,
and were made to lie down for ten
to 15 minutes after giving blood.
Although the majority of donors
did not feel side effects, it is
common to feel tired or faint afA
terwards.

POTENTIAL donors were
screened by a team of nurses from
the Des Moines Community blood
bank. The nurses asked questions
about each person's medical

Last year, at Grinnell's first
blood drive, 137 pints oi blood were
collected after approximately 90
potential donors were deterred ’

This year, the student coor
dinators are sponsoring two such
drives. The second blood drive will
be held the week after spring
break.

ALTHOUGH more volunteers
signed up to donate than last year,
Maris Natkcr, assistant student
coordinator, said she was “very
disappointed with the turnout" oi
volunteer blood donors. Doers
nhoefer also expressed his
disappointment. “We expected it
(the turnout) to grow from last
year a lot more than it did," he
said. He added, “It’s better than
last year, but it seems like we
should have been abie to get more

donors out of a campus of 1200
Students."
