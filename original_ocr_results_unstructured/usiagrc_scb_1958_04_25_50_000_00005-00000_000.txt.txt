the
, jock
element

By Joe Walka

The one distinguishing thing
about the Midwest Conference is
im stand on amateur athletics.

This basic tenet is being cit»
cunivented by certain members
of the conference when they
place undue emv

phasis on Just

one or two of

the sports in

which they par»

ticipate _ such

as football and

basketballi It is

no secret that

certain schools

in the confer»

ence have establshed themselves
as perpetual powers in these two
sports.e.nd it is these same
schools that finish low in the
so-called minor sports.

In 155-55 Grinneu had an av-
erage placing of 2.5 in the nine
sports. This was the highest in
the conference. Last year the
Pioneers, with no championship
teams, had a 3.6 average finish.
This average was second to
Carleton’s 2.5.

It seems to me that a college
that can finish high in all sports
should receive recognition of
some sort from the conference.
This could best lbe accomplished
by the establishment of an All»
Sports trophy to be given to the
conegc with the highest average
finish. I think this would lead

the aforementioned --one or two
1 report" schools to change their re~
to iting policy and would create

sniff competition in all sports.

Last’week the scoring of the
JIM footbai15._ tournament ‘was
changed by the} board. I have
no quarrels as to‘ he merits of
the teams involved, Im.‘ when
the scoring of any tour-numeric
can be changed five months
after its completion, or for that
matter, anytime after its come
pletion, I wonder if a better
method of scoring should not
have been adopted in the first
place.

The Grinnell baseball squad
defeated Cornell here as Tues-
day, but lost for the remainder
of the season two of its most
outstanding players in the pro-
cess. Bill Murray, shortstop, and
Paul Kautzler, center fielder,
both sustained serious knee in-
juries in a hard collision while
attempting to field a short fly
ball.

The accident occurred in
the top half of the ninth in-
ning with one out. Cornell’s
shortstop Bell lifted a short,
fairly high fly ball into shal-
low left»center field. Four
Grinnell players, including
Kantzler and Murray, charged
hard for the ball. At the same
instant as the hall dropped be-
‘tween them. Kanttler and

Murray, both running at top
speed, collided head on

Both Murray, top Pioneer
hitter with a brilliant .468 av—

erage, and Kanttler, third lead—
ing hitter with a very respect-
able .308 average are expected
to be sidelined for the remaim
der of the season. Although the
full extent of their leg and
knee injuries is not completely
certain, enough is known to in-
dicate that neither will the able
to continue their baseball ca-
reers at Grinnell this spring.
This undoubtedly will dampen
the Pioneer hopes for the re-
mainder of the season.

Grinnell pitcher, Dwight
Nissen, limited Cornell to only
five hits in the victory over
the Rams. Meanwhile Grinnell
collected six hits, three of
which were obtained by Mur-
ray, who strokcd a single, at

lowed by Nissen, including a
double. Bud Roegge, Grinneu
first baseman. also hit safely
two times.

Last Saturday, Coe defeated
the Pioneers, 7:0. Grinnell was
limited to only six hits through—
out the nine innings, by ace Coe
hurler Stang. Grinnell left a
total of 11 men stranded‘on the
bases. The game was somewhat
ragged, with a total of seven,
errors committed by both teamsl
