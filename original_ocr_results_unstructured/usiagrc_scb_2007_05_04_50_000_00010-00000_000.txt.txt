Student artists students shown off at Salon

BY REEECCA PARK

Katie Mineek ’07 makes all out of
horsehair. And while that alone may
seem unconventional, what she does
with that mate ‘tl may come as even
more ofa surpr' . Mineck steers away
from more traditional uses ofthe horses
hair brush such as
painting or calligs
mplly; instead she
rilns it against her
ceramic pots to
create patterns. It
is just one exams
pic of the diverse
work displayed at
this weekend's Student Art Salon.

The annual Salon, organized pri-
marily by the Art SEPC, is one of the
most signiﬁcant opportunities Grinnell
student artists have to share their work
with the community. Anyone is W61,
come to submit, majors and non-ma-
jors alike, An outside juror, selected by
the Art SEPC from a list the Art De—
partment faculty provides, curates the
show and decides which pieces are so

lead

”We're here (15 an adl/l'smg role lfl/iey
need it, but students really lake the

son, a curator from the Des Moines Art
Center, Essentially, though, the Salon is
student-run 'ch‘ra here as an advising
role ifthey need it, said Lee Running,
Art. But students really take the lead."
This will be Miticcks second year
participating in the Salon. In addition
to the horsehair
piece, her work
“Frankenstein,”
a fusion of three
different pots,
will be shown. A
_Sociology mas
jot, Mineck said
she appreciates
the creative outlet that ceramics offer,
Fiist dlawn to the medium because she
“wanted to crcate things that were uses
ful,"she said that it later developed into
"a way to visibly sec howl can challenge
myselfaad then accomplish that,"
Another central element of doing
ceramics work for Mineck is the vcrszlr
rility ofclay. She challenges the viewer
by striving to ‘makc people question
whether or not it looks like metal or ctr

ramics or maché or anything,"shc said. .

Melina Rivera '07, another student
artist with a ceramics piece in thc Sas
lon, has had a similar experience. Clay
appeals to her for thc crrcct its tactile
aspect has on artist and viewer. The
sense of touch plays a central role in
her art, she said, involving her persorr
ally as she crafts a ceramics piece and
engaging the viewer “Most people
who go somewhere, you feel like you
canttouch something, she said. “ButI
actually like tempting somebody to ac
tually want to touch a piece‘"

coramics, though, is not the only
medium featured in a show that proms
ises to be as diverse as Grinnell students
themselves. This range is one of the
main lessons Running imparts to her
students. “I try to encourage students
to work broadly," she said, “and to feel
like they can pull materials from their
everyday lives."

The Salon opens today with a re-
ception at 4:30 pm in l-‘aulconor Gal—
lery. Also opening is an exhibit of new
work in clay, paper,pastels and ceramics

Female bonding and, James Bond

Casino Royale (2006)

tittﬁr

Even for a Bond movie, C(m'na Royale, the let
ofﬁcial movie in a 44sycar old franchise, geners
ated immense interest before its release. For one
thing,‘ it had been four years since the last Bond
movie. For another thing, there was a new Bond,
Daniel Craigibut this one, critics worried, was
too blunt, too short, too blond...

But Craig silenced his critics and pleased his
fans by delivering a stellar performance as 007.
All the usual ingredients of the Bond formula are
present in Casino Royale, including, but not lime
ited to, martinis,guns and girls

The plot, mercifully, is simple and logical.
There is no mad scientist trying to destroy the
world or start a third' world war, just Le Chif
fre, a private banker to terrorists, losing his clients’
money and trying to recover it by winning $150
million' in a game ofpoker at Montenegros Car
sino Royale. Bond, as the best poker player in the
British Secret Service, is sent to but Le Chiffre.

Scenes that stand out are Bond’s intemc»
tions with his boss at the Secret Service M (Judi
Dcnch), his search for a guy in the Bahamas, and
last but not the least, the riveting game of poker.

Craig's performance leaves very little room for
complaint. The movie, a prequ‘el to other James
Bond movies, depicts his character development.
Bond is a blunt instrument, somewhat devoid of
the class and sophistication we are used to seeing
in other James Bond movies. He demonstrates a
real brashness as the newly promoted Bondi
ﬁant, cocky and tough as nails Bur Craig tflor
lessly pulls offhis characters many other shadin
the ﬂirtatious womanizer, the tendei romantic,
the smart agent, the brutal and disdainful killer
and the betrayed lover.

Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), Bond's ofﬁcial acs
complicc, doesn't turn out to be your usual Bond
girliher character has substance, which she ens
acts with elan. Her interactions With Bond are one
of the highlights ofthe movre,

Technically, the movie is superb with excellent
camera and visual effects, best exempliﬁed by the
first two adrenalinspumping actions sequences in
Madagascar and Miami.The lighting and camera
effects are good, making the scenes inside the car
sino come alive. And ofcoursc there ale sninning
outdoor locales.

There are some aspects ofthe movie, however,
which keep it from Joining the Holy Trinitv of
Bond movies (From Rmrizl l’l/tll' Lew Git/image:
arid Tlvzllldel'hn/l). The mOVIC tends to drag in the
second half, and could easily have been trimmed

Second, the hallmark ofany great Bond movie
has always been the presence ofa remarkable vile
lain, and while Mads Mikkelsen does an adequate
job as Le Chime, there' is nothing about his char
actor that even remotely matches up to Auric
Goldiinger (Ga/tying”) or lamilio Largo (Thine
limbo/l). And ﬁnally, one is sometimes amazed
that the cold and promiscuous Bond we have seen
over the last four and a halfdecades is falling head
over heels for one particular woman.

All in all, the positives overshadow the nega—
tives and the movie is deﬁnitely worth a watch. A
simple but engaging plot, good performances and
an excellent balance of all the aspects of a Bond
movie make C/(Jllm Royale a complete entertainer.
And just as you're about to leave your seat at the
end, he utters that famous line, that he's Bond ,.
James Bond.

Fm Zane, a 2005 road trip movie by Israeli

S

Free

director Amos Gitai, is a slow, tense and powerful
snapshot oflife in Israel and Jordan. It traces the
events of a single day when three women of dif-
ferent backgrounds cross paths'

Rebecca (Natalie Portman) is a young Ameri~
can living in Israel who has just dumped her fian-
ce’ after learning a little too much about his past.
Distraught and without anything better to do, she
t1kes her mind offher troubles by involving herself
in the dealings between two older woman, Hanna
(Hanna Laslo), and Israeli, and Laila (Hiam Abe
bass), a Palestinian, concerning the business parts
ncrship oi‘thcir respective husbands .

The movie starts with a shot consisting of
nothing except Natalie Portman crying for seven
straight minutes, and soon after goes into a scene
featuring the line “I wouldn’t exactly call it (1 rape,"
which tells you what you need to know about the
film’s tone.

It isn't pure bleakness, though. Redeeming
hope can sometimes be found in moments ofuns
derstanding between the characters and apprecia—
tion orthc beauty oftheir surroundings,

The direction affects ri lthbudget, document
tary-likc stylc,with long takcs, occasionally blurry
and inelegant camera work and liberal use ofawkt
ward silences, in what is doubtless an attempt to
give the film a more personal and realistic feel. It
also presents ﬂashbacks in an interesting way, sue
perimposlug two scenes on screen.

Free Zone, despite its relatively slow pace, than
ages to pack a lot of emotion into its 90-minute
running timeWith a meager plot that is mostly
there to force the characters to deal with one ans
other, its power comes from its understated but
strong performances and the' interactions bemccn
the thiee lead actresses, all ofwhom do excellent
work.
