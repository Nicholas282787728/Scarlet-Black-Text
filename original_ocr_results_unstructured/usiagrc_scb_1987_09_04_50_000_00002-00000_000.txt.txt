time in France

compiled by May-lee Chai

Last semester seven Grin-
nellians studied at the Universite
de Haute oretagnc in Rennes,
France. The iollowing is a coin.
pilation or some or the shattered il-
lusions and pleasant surprises they
experienced while studying there:

Erik Smith:

It's a lot more expensive than i
expected but people are a lot nicer
than I thought they‘d be to
foreigners.

Seth Bumgarner:

My thoughts on France in three
words: lood, wine and women.
Food: .. Thinking first off food is
going to be great over here but no,
It is not. And discovering from my
French ‘mother’ that cooking is
very easy here also. i could even
do it.

Wine: —- Thinking it's got to be
cheaper over here but it’s not--lt‘s
much more expensive than in the
states,

Women: They just ain’t worth it.
Not what everyone says and how
that goes.

i was surprised how nice the peo»
ple are in homes because when
you hear about France you hear,
”0h, they're not going to talk to
you. They’re snotty," and
everything, but they're not. it you
can speak their language

Susan Frager:

We all know what we had in 302
lGrinnell’s French civilization
course] but there are certain
things 1 could not possibly imagine
really happening, like reading our
grades in public, And I’d never
heard oi “Cours de rattrapage"
[make-up courses due to pro
icssors’ absences]. The prois don’t
commit themselves to classes,
Because we are in groups with set
schedules, they know they can
make up class, It's not like that in
the United States because you have
do dirierent people in class, 30 dit-

tcrent schedules. it you miss a
class, there's no way you can make
it up. So they [professors in the U.
S.) are a lot more committed.

There are some classes I’m real-
ly learning a lot in...but i think it‘s
just the fact of my being here that
has improved my French. 1 don't
know what to say about the univer-
sity. It’s been a really interesting
experience.

Amy Logsdon:

i thought the “famed French
men” would be more interesting.
Everyone told me before I left,
“Watch out [or the French men,”
but i haven't found out why yet.

i thought people would be more
antagonistic towards Americans
but they’re friendlier.

Paul Ratte:

i thought a meal in France would
take lorever with a big bottle or
wine and everything, but my lami-
ly eats taster than l do. They’re
done with dinner in 15 minutes and
watchlng TV. The TV is always on.
even while we're eating I just
couldn’t believe it.

Dan Thorburn:

i had e‘tnected to run into lots of
great-tasLing French wine but 1
lound that the French drink wine
that is absolutely atrocious and all
the best wine they export to the U.
5.

But they have a great beer. All oi
Europe has great beer.

Mayrlee Chai:

I didn't expect “irites.” Even
though in 302 we read that the
French love potatoes, I didn't ex-
pect them to really eat trench
rries, But they’re everywhere, The
“RU" [cafeteria], the restaurants.
in my iamily--“iritosl"

I had expected to find French
people very cold and snobby about
the language but, ouoide oi the
university, most everyone's been
very understanding and helpful.
