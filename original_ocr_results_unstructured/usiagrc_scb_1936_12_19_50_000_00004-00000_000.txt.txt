MERRY CHRISTMAS

Next Tuesday, Gl‘inllell students will go
to their homes for the Christmas holidays
while Grinnell professors and officials will
begin their vacationshere in Glinnell or
elsewhere. l l

When students, professors, and officials
return to the campus it will be a new year.
It would be wise for all of us to take in-
ventory of ourselves during the college re
cess and return to Grinnell prepared to
begin the new year with higher ideals and
a greater vision. Let us set a high goal for
ourselves in our relationship to the college
in order that we may build for a better
Grinncll in 1937.

As Grinnell prepares for its Yuletide
recess, the editorial board extends to all of
you, for itself, the managing editor, and the
sta ' of the paper, a merry Christmas and
it bright New Year.

QUESTIONABLE HOLDING COMPANIES

The control of the three billion dollar
empire of the Van Sweringcn brothers was
tossed around “like a toy billlOOn,"il§0 use
the words of Senator Wheeler of Montana,
chairman of the senatorial Railroad Finan-
cial Investigating committee. In 1935 the
brothers were forced to sell the empire at
auction, since it was crumbling from the
depression. G. A. Ball bought the control-
ling stock at about 54 per cent of the mar»
ket price, through the kindness of the Sells
ing New York financiers headed by J. P.
Morgan and C0. After a year and a quar-
ter he showed a profit of 3,500 per cent on
part of the purchase, From these securities
he organized another holding corporation
controlling 249 companies thn he com-
pleted the pyramid, the control of the whole
system rested with $8,250 worth of stock,
Ball gave this stock and an nnnual drawing
account of $100,000 to the Van Sweringens.
In the end they will have to pay the $8,250
out of the $100,000 a year. Thus did they

 

1 gain their empire almost before they lost

Not only do these great holding compan-
ies control as many as 245) subsidiary com~
panics, as in this case, but most of the
holding companies are in the control of a
few big fillztnciels. For example H. D.
Gibson, president of the Manufacturers
Trust co., is a director of over 21 firms.

If big filmllciel agree to toss around
the control of big industrial empires among
themselves like toy balloons, then where is
the freedom of enterprise and competition
that ur economics professors told us were
lequi ites of capitalism? When one big cal -
thlist can purchase the control of a financial
cnlpil'c from other a eeing financiers at
54 per cent of the mallict price and give it
to still other capitalists for about one
month’s salary, which he concurrently gave
them, then what chance has a beginner?
Perhaps monopolisln would be a better name
for our present system,

Q-_
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
l (unin- Northwestern)

Academic freedom is now facing its gravest ass
sault since William Jennings Bryan and his fllndzk
mentalist cohorts bombarded the ivoiy towers of
the nation with the opening chapters of Genesis.
Teacher's oath bills, ‘press persecution, and red-
haiting by ignorant laymen all indicate the in-
creased pressure on academic circles. This attack
menaces the ideal of education and retards the progr
ress of our governmental system toward true demo-
cracy.

In a democracy successful government depends
on the individual's capacity for good judgment. Gen-
uine education is the only means for cvelopiug this
capacity. True, we have never enjoyed democratic
government in the United States. but even the Libs
erty League will admit it is the ideal toward which
we are eternally striving. The existing American
system would he better termed plutocratic than
democratic government, Our great industrialists,
financiers, politicians, and other members of the
"privrleged” class really hold the whip hand. Demos
ci-acy is a label behind which pressure group gov»
ernment has long flourished. Sound education is
the only means of attaining genuine democracy.

Sound education embodies the development of
the capacity for independent thinking and rational
judgment. The demand of the D. A. R. that schools
be turned into training camps for perpetuotoils of
the existing order and the insistence of reformers
that education be devoted to advocating their pai-
tieular remedies are equally opposed to the ideals of
genuine education.

In his book. “The Meaning of a Liberal Educa-
tion," Everett Dean Martin carefully defines the
place of education in true democracy when he says:
“Men become free only as they achieve self governs
merit . . . Any man has liberty when he has a voice
in the government of the land. He has freedom
when he governs himself.” This emancipation from
mass opinion, and selﬂmastery constitute educa-
tion. Education is the means to democratic govern-
ment. Its end is human happiness,

G0 AHEAD. POLISH Your: APPLE
(Syracuse Daily Orange]

“If your professors are gullible enough to {all
for dpplcepolishmg, go ahead and try it; but don’t
sacriﬁce the companionship of toacheis just because
you might be accused of applepohshing.”

Such was the advice given by former chancellor
Charles W. Flint before a group of freshmen
in Hendricks‘ chapel two years ago.

The idea of applerpnlishing is not new, It is
said to have begun when Johnnie put an apple on
teacher's desk. Johnnie wanted to pass and the
teacher liked apples. From this bit of grammar
school diplomacy comes the phrase “appleVpolishr
ing,” campus jargon for the hypocritical friendship
between student and instructor.

Though cases cases like this do exist, an apple
polishing accusation very often is unjust. Because a
student volunteers aid to his instructor in an extr
curricular activity, because he raises his hand in
class once too often, or asks a question after dis-
missal of the class, his intentions are misinterpret-
ed, and he is trademarked "applepolishel‘,"

A really great part in one‘s college life is a sine
cerc Studentrprofessor companionship. At Syracuse
it starts with the freshman tutor-advi 1' system,
together with countless other opportunities by which
the student and the instructor may become ac-
quainted and discuss the student's problems.

A student-professor companionship instills in-
terest in olasswoi-k, squashcs misunderstanding, and
makes college worthwhile.

lvlr, Max Hunn

Editor of the Scarlet and Black
Grllmell College

Grinnell, In.

Dear Sir:

I can't resist sending on to you
and the members of your editorial
board my sincere appreciation of
what is being accomplished in the
presentation of vieivs in the edi-
torial columns of the S. n B.

For the first time, since I have.

been part of the Grinncll college
community, the campus news or
gen has made an effort through a
unified board to give readers
something more than an adolescent
glimpse of campus issues Political
and social issues are not too mar
ture for college students, and an
intelligent approach to them
through editorials certainly
uommelldablc.

is

It was particularly interesting
to me to road the reprint editorial
that appear-ed in the issue of Do»
ccnilior 5, entitled the “Price of
Speed in Modern Business," from
the Daily Trojan

During the summer of 1935, I
spent two months in social work
in the West Virginia area men-
tioncd The anguish of these
wal ’ng dead," the squalor in
which they live, and the injustice
that has been done them and their
families is irreparable. Is it too
much to hope, that by keeping
these spectres before the public
we can one day believe that big
busmess has learned its lesson?

This silicosis case was consid-
ered in a government Investiga-
tion last year, with the chief wits
iiess being the New York social
worker- under whom I worked in
West Virginia. We took motion
pictures of the victims, their
homes, and secured information
about the details of Working con-
ditions in the Gauley Bridge tunnel.
Much of this material was present-
Cd in the investigation. As far as
I know, at this time, there has
been nothing more than a momen-
tary period of indignation.

This cure is just one example of
the countless issues that go down
into oblivion. It is the responsi-
bility of newspapers to keep alive
the problems that will arise again
and again, whether they are ques-
tions of big business, world peace,
international brotherhood, o :-
whatever, College papers are as
responsible for forming public
opinion as the largest of the me-
tropolitan organizations.

It has seemed to inc that the
S. at B. has taken upon itself
quite a task in the newly—institut-
ed editorial board. Obviously, it
has been functioning, and doing
an admirable job, too.

My hearty congratulations and
best wishes for continuation of
that integrity.

Sincerely yours,
Lorraine Buckman, '36.

Class Tank Meet Dropped
for Lack of Entries

The annual inter-class swimming
meet, which was scheduled for

sophomores in default of suificient
entries by the other classes, it was
announced yesterday. This is the
first limo iii recent years that the
annual contest has not been held.

Five pairs of stained glass win-
dows representing faith, hope,
charity, justice, and wisdom will
he installed this month in the
Heinz Meiiioiiol chapel at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

The personal papers of the late
Dr Henry Van Dyke, author, cler-
gyman, diplomat. and educator.

sentcd by his literary executors to
