Wedge is out of place on ballot

Whether it's the persistent tuition liiltes or the AWOL
bean bags,it can seem that the administration does not listen
to student input about in 'or or minor campus issues. But the
fresh hatch of student initiatives shows that we may under
mine our own efforts to change campus.

When an initrrrtive proposes that SGA help destroy the
evil Empire, this dctraets from the legitimate calls for a cams
pus nutritionist, a student enviionmenlal coordinator and a
Middle Eastern Studies concentration submitting such joke
inrt tives ulidoes much ofthi: considerable energy put into
w ting and collecting hundreds of
signatures for the 14 other initiatives.
There are multiple outlets on carupus
for humor (the GUM, the Bass and
Plans to name it few), but student
initiatives are not one of them. The
Wedge Antilles initiative was written
for humor, but we feel that jolte ini-
tiatives, such is last year's Conserva—
tory of Awesome proposal, actually work against attempts
to make init- lives into an effective voice for change. They
nuke the irnn ivc process sccm inclcvanr to both students
and the ndmi stration, keeping students from voting and
the administration from following through on the results.

Some students assert that initiatives are not worth getting
upset about, and may as well be used for humor. It can be
tempting to point to initiatives that passed but went nowhere
as evidence that the process doesn't yield results. Outdoor
lighting on campus didn't change as a result oflast year's light
pollution initiative nor do we have a dark room yet.

But for all these fizzlcs, we can also point to successful
initiatives. In 1996, voting led to the rebirth of ExCo and
an increase in the number of computers available in Bulls

ing (there had been only eight before).The picnic benches
we find around campus quickly appeared after a successful
campus initiative And dont forget about meal equivalency!
Last year's overwhelming support for the initiative in favor
ofGr-ab n G0 was important in salvaging equivalency in the
form ofOutTakes.

Another important role of initiatives is to formally docu—
ment student opinion. In December 2002, 78 percent stu-
dents passed an initiative hoping to prevent the war in Iraq.
This symbolic gesture was no less sincere because it did not
single-handcdly halt the war by the
end of the 5611165!ch This week's llil’
tiatives signal student support for ofa
new study space in (and, an Africana
Studies concentration, longer Fitness
Center hours and more community
service funding. SGA has rtlready bee
gun work on several of the initials
tivcs, but joke initiatives suggest that
GriniieLlians do not see the initiative process as legitimate.
This weakens the ability of students to implement change.

Some say that the administration does not listen to stun
dent opinion as embodied by initiatives, so joke initiatives
are just a symptom ofa largcr problem. But ifwe do not take
initiatives seriously, we cannot expect the administration to
take them seriously either. Even without immediate change,
initiatives provide weight in student discussions with the ad-
niinistration.‘1‘he process is a cumulative one that builds upon
the strength of all previous initiatives. lfwe are frustrated by
rhc speed of response to student but ives, we should not
give up on the process altogether. Giving the process as much
legitimacy as we can now means that. in the future, initiatives
could really mold this campus,

 

In Washington, the President begins to quack

Sheahan Virgin explains what the Democratic sweep of mid—term elections means for Bush's final two years

President Bush needs to open his eyes, be
cause believe me, keeping rhern closed is not
going to make Tuesday night’s electron results
go away. The sooner the president realizes that
his party blew it, the sooner the White House
will be able to accept fate, regroup, and move
on. In retrospect, entering the final stretch of
the midterm elections with predicnons that the
Republican Party
would preserve
majorities in both
houses of Cont
grass (a Viewpoint
which every polls
ster contradicted)
was probably not
the administra-
tion’s best tactic.The president’s optimism was
mistaken, and now his nightmares are reality.
The Democratic Party has finally punched
back after having been robbed in 2000, ignored
in 2002 rind embarrassed in 2004.

Washington works in amusing ways. It
seems that, not too long ago, President Bush
was using the results of the 2004 presidential
elcction to argue that the American people
had overwhelmingly presented him with a
political mandate The White Housmcmholds
cned and reinvigorated by having (Irma/[Jr up”
the election this time around, immediately
released statements detailing what would den
fine Presulem Bush’s second term. The plan
they outlined, although now largely forgotten,
was marked by hold and daring policies that
pledged to solve cvelything from the war in
Iraq to social security. in short, Bush was con—
cerned about constructing an honorable and
memorable legacy.

Fast-forward two years later to Nov. 8,2006,
when everything has changedThe president's
beloved mandate, ifit ever existed outside the
administration’s dreams, is squandered and his
legacy lies in tartcrs.Thc events ofthe last two
yearsiFEMA's outrageous Hurricane Katrina
response, the Defense Department's botched
War on Terror, and the State Department's dc-
rcriorating rclations wuh nucleattwouldrhc:

powers Iran and North Koreaih‘avc severely
tarnished the presidcnr‘s image. He is a poliiit
cal nonentrty, unpopular with 63 percent of the
American people and abandoned by his own,
increasingly rebellious Republican Party.

And now, [be Dcmcnah hold the reins of
congressional power, largely because they suc—
cessfully tied every Republican candidate to

Bush's unpopular
positions. Twelve
years of GOP rule
on capirol Hill
has come crasht
ing down. After
Tuesday night,
President Bush is
ofﬁcially a lame
duck, a characterization that should still have
been two years away.

A lameduck traditionally denotes the pe-
riod between a leader’s failure to win reelec-
[ion (either because of clectoral defeat or
term llmtrsisee Clinton, Bill in 2000) and
his successors inauguration.

The leader's days in orfrcc are

numbered, and thcrcrorc, pol. The Democrat Party has ﬁnally
punched back after hay/rig been
robbed lrl Z000, ignored in 2002
and embarrassed m 2004.

iricians in both parrics ignore
his wishes, obstruct his polls
tics and actively search for
new political siantlatdthe‘art
crs, But because of resoundt
mg Democratic victories four
days ago and sot years ofeins
barmssrng administration missteps, twilight
has descended upon the White House nearly
five hundred days too Cally,

Perhaps an appropriate question to ask is
whether or not the presidenr has the potent
tial to reveise his fortune and to postpone the
eventual reduction of his inﬂuclice.Vl/l1lle a
liaiidiiil of crimnientarois have predicted that
the White House will effectively regroup and
recover in time to make Bush’s final years in
OffiCC fruitful, I wonder to what extent the
president's effectiveness is now iii the hands of
other politicians.

The president's future depends, in part,

upon what he is able to accomplish between
now and November 2008. However, legislative
success will likely rcqu'rc a Democratic House
that is not too disruptive, aggressive and
\’Cng€flll.Vl/l‘llle antitadministration libtr‘ in
the Democratic mayorrty will be offset slightly
by an inﬂux ofrelatrvely moderate Democrats
(newly elected from previously Republican
districts), the president will lrkely struggle to
win ovcr rhosc "Old Guard"eongressmen who
he neglected for nearly Six years.

Additionally, rhc president’s potential also
hinges upon the likelihood that Republican
legislators, activists and voters will wrllingly re»
turn to and support a leader from whom they
spent the better part ofzooo trying to distance
themselves. In a political cpoch in which the
survival of GOP candidates is directly res
lated to their opposition to President Bush’s
agenda, I wonder to what extent Republicans
will reunrre and rally behind the president.
With about 200 House seats and 21 Senate
seats to defend in 2008,] find it very unlikely
that 2008 Republican €311le
dares will embrace a president
\vllosc unpopulanty caused so
many oftheil colleagues to be
defeated in 2006.

With Democrats seeks
mg revenge and Republicans
seeking distance, the president
may have to accept the fact
that he is no longer a general
among soldier-s Likely, he will be reprimanded
by Republicans and Democrats alike for doing
this and for failing ro do that.

Bush must accept (his criticism, learn trom
it, and prepare for a new period in which he no
longer runs the cables in Washington. Mak-
ing concessions to his party and suggesting to
House Democrats his desire to seek bipartisan
solutions is a good first step A humble and
accommodating president is now required.
Hopefully, Bush’s mytwnynorrthcdiighway,

are, at last, a thing ofthe past.
