selves while Mrs Robbins gave a
very intertsting talk on Oriental
rugs. it is a subject especially
interesting to and one on
which she has stttdlcd a great
deal, She told of the different
cla esttho make the rugs, how
one can tell whether rugs

ways they express their religion

pose; the prayer rug was especialr
1y interesting. Work was [re
quently interrupted during the
evening to examine the rugs for
points of interest which Mrs,
Robbins mentioned. The differ-
erit kinds of knots in Persian and
Turkish rugs, thegeometrical and
ﬂoral designs, the crude reprer
senlations of animals, the kinds
of wool and hair, the process of
dyeing and the colors used. tiere
all interesting subjects. Every-
one present felt that it had been
a very proﬁtable evening and one
long to be remembered by the
Senior girls.
