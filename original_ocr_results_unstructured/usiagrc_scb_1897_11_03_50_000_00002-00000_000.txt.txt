IN ano'rn R column we publish
a letter troni Rev. George E.
White. ’32, who has charge of Anr
atolia College at Maisovan, Tiirr
key. in regard to the work or one
of our fmmer students who did
not graduate Theie are many or
these who are doubtless doing
noble work in many lines but it is
very hard to get any accurate and
complete record oi'them. If theie
are others who know of such men
and women. a word about whose
lives would be of interest to Iowa
College. let them lollow the ex-
ample of Mr. White and commune

this way this desired inrormatinn

Track'Pi-ospects.

A lett words may properly be
said just now in connection with
the Frill Field Meet in regard to
the prospects next
Spring. The ﬁrst intercollegiate
track meet will he the Dual Lea-
gue games with S. U. I. Forthis
we will need three men and one
substitute in each event. S U. I.
will be particulaily strong in the
spiiiits. jumps and ueiglits. In
fact she will give ~ hard contests
everywhere Our easy Victory of
last year will not be repeated.

If we win as we must. it must
be by an all round team and for
this men who can win seconds and
thirds ate just as indispe able as
those who can win ﬁrs . Every
man has a chance tor a place on
the team, and any one who has
ability in any line is shirt-mg re»
sponsibility if he does not come
out and make the most ofit. As
sooti as the season for outdoor
sport the gymnasium
classes will be started and all pos
sible candidates for the team
should enter these and endeavor
to keep in condition and be ready
tor outrdoor work as soon as the

day afternoon in regard to foot
.ball was very well attended con-
sidering the rather unpleasant
weather. As the resolutions
adopted there are now pending
before the faculty no turtlier menr

thing very noticeable in regard to
the personnel of the meeting
which seems worthy of comment.
It is. naturally supposed that in
such a body the upper classmen
shall be the leading spiiits. This
was not true Monday afternoon.
The junior class was fairly well
