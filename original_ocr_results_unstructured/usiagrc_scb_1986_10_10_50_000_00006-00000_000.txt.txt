Stolen
Photos

It would seem logical for the Scarlet
and Black and the Cyclone to share
hotographs from time to time. The
two organizations share a darkroom
and often take pictures of the some
events.

But last semester, the editor and
hoto editor of the Cyclone generally
refused to allow the Scarlet and Black
to use yearbook photos. The reason
given was that they did not want peo-
rle to think that the yearbook took
the pictures from the Scarlet and
Block, I even offered to list the picture
as a “Cyclone Photo” in the outline
beneath the picture. But that was not
enough

That is a completely justifiable
erogative of the editor of the year-
book. If the yearbook wants to
withhold its photo's, it has every right
to deny the right ofpublication to the
Scarlet and Black or any other
organization. But, by refusing to
allow the Scarlet and Black to use its

pictures the Cyclone forfeited an
moral claim that it might make to us'
Scarlet and Black Photos.

When I looked through my Year-
book last week I was rather shocked to
find at least a dozen Scarlet and Black
shots. These pictures can be found on
pages 25, 32, 38, 66, 67, 68, 70, 73,
76, and 77, none of which I, as Scarlet
and Black photo editor, had authoriz-
ed the Cyclone to use.

Worse yet, the Cyclone acknowledg-
ed neither the Scarlet and Black nor
the names of any of the Scarlet and
Black photographers. Ifa similar incir
dent had occurred in a class, the ac»
tions of the editors of the Cyclone
would have been called plagiarism.

The Scarlet and Black
photographers deserve credit for the
work they do, They are unpaid and
volunteer the use of hundreds of
dollars worth of personal equipment,
The small cutline at the bottom of a
icture is the only reward for their ef-
forts. For the Cyclone editors to take
this away from them is beyond con»
temptible.

ortunately, it appears that they will

conduct themselves more thoughtful-
ly than last year’s staff.

Hopefully, for the sake of the quali~

this spirit of

,ooperatton will last through the year.

Protest
Questioned

To the Editor:

The display that was set up for the pro-
test against aid in the Nicaraguan Contras
included some highly emotionally—charged
imagery, The portrayal of a child's coffin
and the posting of a banner decrying the
use of American dollars “for death in
Nicaragua” suggest that support for die
Contras or aid to the Contras indicates inc
difference to me lives and happiness of the
Nicaraguan people. Although I agree with
the demonstrators that aid to the Contras
is probably unwise, i feel that the way they
expressed their view constituted an unfair
attack on the morals and character of
those persons who disagree with them on
the issue.

There are persons who sincerely believe
that it is in the best interests of the
Nicaraguan people to support the Contras’
fight against what they perceive as a
hopelessly corrupt and tyrannous govern-
ment. Many also believe that overthrow of
the Sandinista government is necessary to
prevent the spread of Marxist-Leninist
governments within the western
hemisphere. Whether or not the views of
those who favor Contra aid are justified
depends on the answers to a number of
questions. is the Sandinista regime so
committed to Marxist-Leninist ideology
that the only hope of the Nicaraguan peo-
ple for a free society lies in its overthrow?
What dangers does the Sandinista regime
present to the other countries in the
Western hemisphere? If the Contras were
to prevail. would they establish a
pluralistic democracy or a cronycapir
talist regime like Somoza’s? How willinf'
is either side to negotiate? What is the best
route to longrterm peace, stability and
freedom in Nicaragua? Whatever answers
one chooses to give, these are not moral
questions. The basic question here is not
“how much do I care about the
Nicaraguan people?”, but “what view of
the situation in Central America best fits
reality?” To emotionalize this issue and
try to treat it as a simple moral question,
rather than a complex policy problem
which may have moral overtones, is utter-
ly unhelpful to those who are trying to deal
with the complexities of the issue and
make a reasoned decision. When the
demonstrators light candles and write in
fllammatory slogans on banners, they not
only fail to address the complex issue, but
alienate those people who do not share
their absolute conviction by implying that
they are Somehow morally deficient. The
implication that those who think about sup
porting Contra aid are unconcerned about
the deaths of children and the statement
that those who lavor Contra aid are “for
death in Nicaragua' are particularly offen~
sive.

1 would encourage those persons who
participated in the protest. to question the
assumptions on which they base their
political beliefs I would most of all Say
this: before casting moral judgments on
other people or the views they hold, try to
understand their perspective. You may not
change your mind on thejssues, but you
will be able to communicate more mean-
ingl'ully with other students. The political
dialog on campus would become both more
rewarding and more pleasant, — David W.

“Merely Waste”

To the Editor,

i was somewhat dismayed to notice that
yet another Grinnell student's week was so
devoid of importance that he chose to
divert himself by taking a belaboring lash
at the dead horse which is the issue of our
school’s new logo. The author correctly
asserted that the logo is designed to imr
prove and consolidate the school’s image
in order to increase the applicant pool and
attract better students. I would argue that
ii the writing technique, logic. and
organization displayed in this particular

‘letter are in any way representative of the

abilities of Gﬁnnell students. the adr ‘

ministration is completely justified in tak-
ing whatever steps it deems necessary to
attract better students,

But I think there is something worse
about this letter than that it makes one
wonder who Wrote the author’s Grinnell
application essay. It is bad satire. Rather
than provoking laughter from the reader
who realizes that he is sarcastically pro-
posing a stupid idea, the author gives one
the feeling that perhaps he really is stupid
enough to believe in what he is writing; I
trust mat such is not the case. Regardless,
one would hope that at an institution of
Grinnell’s calibre there would be students
who, if they chose to waste their time argu-
ing such a moot point, would at least be
able to produce some reasonably amusing
and aesthetically pleasing waste. This
most recent letter is merely waste. a

‘ ‘Load
of

Rubbish?

Dear Editor, '

As I read Shelly Reid's “Way Out in Lone
don” last week, I found myself bothered by
one aspect of her article: her implication
that, due to their frequent readlng of the
tabloids, the British people are less in
formed about world events than
Americans. Although I’m Sure her come
ments were In jest, I still felt that they
grossly misrepresented the British people,
I've lived in England for ten years, and it
is my estimation that the average Briton is
infinitely more aware of world events than
the typical American. I've found many an
Englishperson, old and young alike. that
could tell me more details about various
international events than I was aware of
myself.

It is unfair to base one's assessment of a
culture on these kinds of isolated observa
tions. if an Englishperson came to the
United States and talked to some of the
Americans I've conversed With, and
generalized about Americans solely on the
basis of those experiences, who knows
what opinions he/she would form of
Americans! !

Like i said, MS. Reid was probably ”just
joshing", but as one who knows the British
people well, I found her ethnocentric ap-
praoch. particularly the comment ”no
wonder the British lost America”. offenr
sive aild not demonstrative of the open
minded attitude we seek at Grinnell.
Bloody load of rubbish. if 1 may so

Dear Ted,

The times that I’ve shaved my legs, I’ve
always started where the hair does. I
assume most people use the same criterion
when shaving their legs and feet. But that
really isn’t why I’m writing.

First. I'd like you to reconsider your
statement that die men of Grinnell would
find it interesting to know Whether and
how women shave meir feet. The ones that
I asked Couldn't care less. Further, the
women I've asked, regardless of whether
the shave their legs or not, also couldn’t
care less. »

Please refrain from calling yourself a
typical male or even a typical ignorant
male. You are quite unique. The insights
you share and the questions you pose in
your column reflect this, Be proud of iL

One last point. John Harrison has said
repeatedly at the Scarlet and Black staff
meetings that he is trying to put out a
quality paper and maintain at least some
minimal standards of journalism.
Sometimes the choice [or quality leaves
people out in the cold. If “Shaved feet” is
representative of the view from the top,
then were I in the editor’s shoes, i would be
similarly “heartless.” 7 Marty
