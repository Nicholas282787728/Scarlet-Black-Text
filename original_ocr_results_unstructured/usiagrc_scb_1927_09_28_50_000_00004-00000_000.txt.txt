Conference Teams

Will Go To Annual 1055001th
Event In November Besides
other Contests.

Although the athletic department
has not issued a linal statement in re
garti to the tail schedule [or the Pin-
neer cross country team. Coach Lcstcr
Duke has had his barrio working out
regularly lor several tlllys, and indi-
cated in a short iutcrunw this morn»
ing that Grinncll would meet several
Missul ' Valley teams in conterence
meets, and that a team would he sent
to the annual ccnicrencc cross coun—
try event in November.

Have Three Veterans.

With three veterans to call on. and
a capable squad reporting every eves
ning, prospects tor another victorious
season are promising. Captain Hoffa
man, '23, will lead the squad, and will
have as veteran running mates Wyatt,
.2 , and Risser, '20. These two men
turned in several very creditable per-

foi'mmiccs last fall in dual competier

tion, and are looked to to place high
in every contest this tall. Wyatt is
the most promising oi the three, and
seems to he in much better shape this
tall than last, when he was bothered
by a disagreeable cold a good deal or
the time.
New Men ileum-t.

Among the new men who are re-
porting are Campbell, '30, G. Smith,
’23, Wiseman, ’20, Phillips. '30. and
Wenger, '20. Selle, ’28, a letter man in
the two mile, is expected to report in
several days.

0t the new men, Phillips is looked
upon as the most promising, as he
turned in several tine races last
spring. both over the longer cross
country course and in the mile run on
the treshman track squad. Wenger
and Wiseman are both capable dis-
tance men, and are expected to finish
well up in all races, according to
Coach Duke.

College Receives
$300,000 In Gifts

In the September number at Grin-
nell and You, the college alumni ma—
gazine just off die press, it is stated
that gitts received by the college dun
ing the past year amount to more than

' $300,000.

The chief items in this sum are the
Maytag scholarshipdoan fund of
$50,000, given by Mr. F. L. Maytag, of
Newton, a member or the board of
trustees; a gift or $24,000 from Miss
Alice Wnre, ot Omaha, :1 member of
the class of 1886: the sum or approx-
imately $100,000 which is the share of
the college in the Blossom estate, and
several other large gltts trom un-
named donors.

Most of these funds are allotted to
scholarships on the scholarshlpdoan
plan which was announced by Presi-
dent ltiain last year. The college needs
further large sums, tor this purpose,
according to otticials, in order to ex-
tend the scholarship—loan privilege to
many applicants who dosrve'it, hoth
treshmen and unperelassmen.

“That the home problem ot the Ani-

“The contercnce undoubtedly did a
great deal or good in smoothing out

First Meeting Since Will‘.

"he contcrence at Ilnlsiuglors was
the iii-st international council since
the World war, and the “PM, of its kind
whore boys could voice their opinions
as well as the men. It was attended

by 1500 delegates trom 57 countries.
Housing arrangements were provided
in a large boys' school, and it was ar-
ranged for boys of five different na-
tionalities to sleep ln each room. This
was a Vl\l\lﬂl}le factor in helping the
races get acquainted, Kcaling said, as
most of the Europeans knew enough
English to get along, and were not the
least lmckwlll‘ll about trying it.

The reason Finland was chosen for
the site of the conference was that
Finland was a neutral country in the
last. will", and no [races of deep pol-
lliozll scilliluunt could possibly inter-
fere with the harmony of the convene
linn. The site of the next conference

has not definitely been chosen, but
will probably be in Canada in 1930.
