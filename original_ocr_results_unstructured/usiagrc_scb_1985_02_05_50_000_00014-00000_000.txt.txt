Less

by David liei'ouiig

More variety will mean less pop this
semester as KDlC starts its fourth month
oi 100 watt broadcasting.

Listeners can expect more Jazz and
classical music. in additioll to shows which
aim to increase awareness of music made
away from the top 40 scene, Program
director. Davtd Mathias promised, New
shows will be added While some from last
semester will return including "Brandy ot
the Damned." KDIC'S verston of National
Public Radio's ”First Hearing.” Student
critics will review fresh muscial releases
heiore they saturate the national an»
waves.

When the critics' musical opinions come
into conflict. the ensuing argument should
always be interesting. ii not at times a bit
hostile. Tune in to hear friendships end.
live on the air.

“Maxtmum Rock and Roll." a program
ieatured on the station two years ago will
return. This hourvlong weekly program
from Los Angeles takes a look into clubs
all across America where struggling unr
signed bands are making their debuts The
program is eVidence that the American
garage band scene is alive and well,

Just a iew years ago The Replacements.
were a struggling band ieatured in the
Minneapolis club scene. then lasl year
their 12inch single “1 Will Dare" sold
more copies than any other 127inch in the
nation. “Maximum Rock and Roll" is a
chance to pick tomorrow's music world
success stories today.

Beiore the rennovation oi KDlC was
completed last October. many people werc
wondering if Grinnell College students
were ready ior the responsibility oi
operating a 100 watt FM radio station But.
from the ilrst sign on. a new proiessional
attitude prevailed at the station among the
disc jockeys and the management staff
alike.

With the renovations KDIC has taken on ,

the look and the sound of a “real” station,

Comments from students have been
positive. most saying they liked much oi
what they heard though a common corn»
plaint was that KDIC's sign on time at o
a.m. didn't allow folks to set their clock
radios to 88 5 FM in order to get up for B or
9 o'clock classes. This problem will be
alleviated by a 7 am. sign on time seven
days a week. The station will lie dormant
between the hours of 3 am, and 7 am.
With the expanded broadcast radius ofjusl
under 20 miles. the station hopes to provide
programming geared towards the large
non-college audience which may not know
that the station exists. in addition to any
programming measures. announcers will
give the full seven digit request line
