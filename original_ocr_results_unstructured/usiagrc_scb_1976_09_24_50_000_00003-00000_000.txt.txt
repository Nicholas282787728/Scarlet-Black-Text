fourth attempt

by Jun Neidei'bach

For the ioiirth time in two years,
voters ol the Gi'innelerewburg
School District will be asked this
Tuesdayto approve a multimillion
dollar bond issue to linance the
construction and repair oi
secondary school iacilities This
vote concerns the issuance oi a-3.7
million dollar bond to iinance the
building ofa new junior high school
on the south side oi Grinnell, and
also to pay for minor repairs of the
old junior high to end split shifting
tin eiiect since last tall) Split
shitting would conceivably con-
tinue at least until completion or
the new building itwo or three
years).

Proponents oi the bond issue,
which must be approved by oil per
cent to pass, have tried hard to get
Grinnell College students to vote.
Led largely by a group oi students
who grew up in Grinnell, they point

out that the bond issue has come
closer to passage with each Sues
Ceeding vote, and fell short of
passage by just 111 votes last
spring, Stressing that most
students pay sales and liquor taxes
in Grinnell, and that many pay
property taxes in their rent, they
feel that students are morally and
legally eligible to vote here.
Moreover, in the words oi one
Grinnell professor, “if Grinnell
schoolsdon’t Start to improve their
facilities, Grinnell will become a
much less desirable place for
faculty to live, and that affects
students.”

Polls are open on September 28th
from 7 a.mt to Bp.m., and all those
registered in Grinnell can vote.
Students living onrcampus or
North of 6th Avenue vote at Bailey
Park School; those living South of
6th Avenue vote at the Veterans
Memorial Building.

the crowd before actually doing so.

Russian immigrant
‘ , begins new life at Grinnell

by Lucy Mattingly

"I really like America;
sometimes I wake up and can‘t
believe rm here and not just
watching some nice Russian
movie,"

Lena Rubinova, the new Russian
assistant at Grinnell, has only been
in the United States a short while.
Six months ago, Elena and her
iamiiy immigrated to the United
states irom Leningrad. ”I met a
man, John Glad, three years ago in
Crimea, He was a protessor oi
Russian at the University of
Chicago. He and the other students
in his group were the only
Americans I know. So, when i
came to America, I went to
Chicago.” At that time, Mr. Glad
was teaching at the University oi
lowa and had heard that the
Russian department at Grinnell
was looking tor a native Russian
.speaker. Elena came to Grinnell

. and met Russian protessors John

Mohan and Sheila McCarthy, She
‘* commented that their attitudes, in
, addition to the atmosphere at
Grinnell inﬂuenced her decision to
study here,

Elena studied engineering at a
technical university in Russia, but
after three years She decided that
she was no longer interested in
becoming an engineer. To enter

 

another field, Lena would have had
to start all over again and come
pletely lose the three years she had
already taken, so she quit School.

“Grinnell is really a good place

for studying," Elena remarked.

“It‘s very peaceiul and quiet. ii i
had gone to school in Chicago
(Elena’s parents are both working
as engineers there and are
studying English at Loyola
University) there would have been
too many distractions,” Elena
pointed out that colleges in the
Soviet Union are very different
from colleges in America. “in
Russxa, people lry to get into
schools in the city they live in. All
the universities are in big cities
You would never see a college in
such a small town as Grin-
nell." Elena also commented that
the only people who lived in dor-
mitories in Russm were students
irom small towns who were going
to school away from home. She
described the dorms as being very
small with no sinks or bathrooms.
A typical single room at Grinnell
might house three people in a
Soviet university. Elena added that
Russian students are not
necessarily more serious about
iheir studies than are their
American counterparts, despite
the seemingly more rigorous

 

academic schedule they must
follow Lena further related that in
the Soviet Union, one begins school
at age seven, takes required
courses such as mathematics.
physics. physical education,
literature and history. It is possible
tor a Russian student to complete
his or her studies ineight years.
but for those Who Wish to continue,
there is a ninth and a tenth year
which are Similar to American
high school or college
preparatory work. Alter the tenth
year of schooling, a student may
take an examination to get into a
SpeClalized university. Six years in
such an institution is sufficient
timeio earn a diploma comparable
to a Master’s degrec.

In addition to lhe difference
between school systems. Elena
cited a difference between the
people she has met here and in
Russia “The people in the United
States are much more kindly. but
they have so much more, in the
Soviet Union, people work at least
eight hours a day and then have to
stand in line for several more
hours to try and get iresh bread or
meat. Sometimes after they stand
there that long, they don’t get
anything People in RUSSia always
look very tired, They don’t have
fun like the people in America do.”

“America and the Soviet Union
are two diiierent worlds; ab-
solutely everything is diiierent,”
reiterated Elena. “It was such a
shock when I came here. it’s very
hard in the Soviet Union to get
iniormation about America or
about any foreign cities "

Surprisingly, Elena said she had
read a great deal oi American
literature, Hemingway, Twain,
and Fitzgerald to name a lew. Most
oi these books were in her family's
private collection However, she
noted that it was very diliicult tor
her to understand American
literature, “I didn‘t understand
Faulkner. 1 think to understand
Russian literature you have to be
Russian and to understand
American literature you have to be
American,”

At Grinnell, Elena is taking Art
History, American Civilization,
and a tutorial, “Saul Bellow: A
RuSSlan-Jewish Voice in American
Fiction.” ironically she will be
learning something about the
country in which she would be
spending the rest oi her hie. She
Wants also to take some Russmll
History “to maybe see how it
really was: Elena plans to learn
both French and German and

 

hopes to go into international law.

During the last seven years. since,

men while she is perlorming seems
to be a factor in her decision to
continue to strip. Debbie noted that

"Sugar Daddy" proposition in-
cluding a brand new car, apart-
ment, and money Just to be there

remarked that “if you cannot do it

The Dew Drop inn is just a stop
on the stripper's circuit in Iowa.
Debbie has stripped in virtually all
the places lowa has to offer. She
enjoys the Dew Drop because the
bar is “mellow" and it “puts lne in
a good mood.” She feels that at 25,
she has another ten years lett in
the profession. She is a vegetarian,
tries to maintain her muscle tone
and to enjoy the work.

When I asked Debbie Whether
she considered what she was doing
deviant behavior, she said, ”LEI
me put it this way, I appeal to the
crotch oi other people.”

Whatever apprehension I
had beiore doing the article was
erased by a ieeling that there was a
genuine person behind a body iuil
oi motions. And that was a good
feeling to leave with.
