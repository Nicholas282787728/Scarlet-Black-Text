Be kind to eggscelent eggs If we close the open curriculum Oh baby, it’s so cold inside

There was a time when I could go to break—
, fast and be in a long lino and not have to worry
about waiting for everyone to get omlettes. It Was
just common courtesy that you don’t get one, so‘
‘ that everyone can get their daily protein AND
not be late for class. But lo and behold, Iwent to
breakfast today and of the four people in front
of me, three got omlettes. I’m not saying that
people should swear off OmlEtchr eggs in
general‘just that people consider that to make
scrambled cggs takes three minutes, Omlettcs
need ﬁve to six minutes and far too muda care
and precision.

First the bean bag mom died. Then the Forum
and Quad. Today, I learned that the administration
has decided to remove the phrase “open Curricu-
lum" from all promotional material sent to prospec-
rive students, and is considering enacting an ofﬁcial
distribution requirement of three courses from each
division. Now, personally, I’ve met this distribution
requirement twice over. But I am unhappy, because
the open curriculum sent a message: “We treat our
studcnts like adults. We let them decide how to run
their education.”Maybc I’m just r jaded senior, but I
fool Grinndl is losing its character. We’re just like all
our peer institutions, except a little bit wealthier. How
do you expect in attract bright srurionrs to the middle
or efﬁng nowhere with r Cookie-cutter college? In
weren’t a senior, I’d think about. transferring.

The ch boasts a ﬁreplace lounge. While this
lounge has incredibly comfy chairs and couch,I feel
like there is something miss'm from it. Oh wait,
that would be the ﬁre in the replace. How hard
would it be for them to turn the ﬁre on? It appears
to he a gas ﬁreplace, so at most they would have
to press a button or twist a knob. If they are going
to deprive us of actually having a ﬁre, they used
to close the ﬂue so we don't freeze while sitting in
there. Ir’s like having aTV lounge with a gigantic
plasma television that can never be turned onVnot
cool. Light a ﬁre so the lounge can live up to its
name and we can have a cozy place to study during
the gloriously dreary winter months.
