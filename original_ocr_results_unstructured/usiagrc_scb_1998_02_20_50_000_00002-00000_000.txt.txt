Alternative Spring Break Gets Into Action

BY SARAH RELNHARD
Staff Writer

As spring break rapidly ap-
proaches, many Grinnellians seek
alternatives [0 the traditional visit
home. Alternative Break, a program
sponsored by the college, provides
ideal solutions in such cases. Durr
ing both fall and spring break, a va-
riety ofcommunity service oriented
trips providestudents with fulfilling,
affordable fun,

“We get funding from the college
to help keep student costs to a mini-
mum.” said Matt Rhoades ‘99, who
is a member ofthe Alternative Break
Committee.

All trips. which include transpor-
tation. room, and board, are priced
at $60-$80, a sum much lower than
what students usually have to spend
on a bus or plane ticket home.

“It’s definitely better to help
people over the two weeks of break
than it is to sit at home and be bored,“
noted Eric Noftle ‘01. Noftle, who
attended one previous Alternative
Break to an Indian Reservation in
South Dakota, enjoyed his fall expe
rience so much that he is anxious for
a repeat performance.

There is a diverse choice of alter-
native breaks this spring.

The Denver, CO/Flagstaff, AR
trip, organized by Molly Stenberg
‘00 and Brad Hilkene ‘00, features a
week working with the Native

American Community Action
Group, including one day spent in the
Grand Canyon. The second week
involves work with Denver’s Rescue
Mission, where students can expect
to be in contact with the homeless at
many sites, including farms, soup
kitchens and child care centers

On the Springﬁeld, Missouri trip,
students will spend time at the Agape
House, a place where women and
children who have loved ones in a
penitentiary come to visit on week
ends, In addition, some time will be
spent at the Kids' Cafe, which serves
meals to povertyrstricken children
Organized by Jen Larimcr ‘99, the
trip will offer a wide variety of addir
tional'opportunities, such as work-
ing at thrift shops and the Ronald
McDonald house, depending on the
interests of the participants,

Two trips to San Francisco were
organized for this semester’s Alter)
native Break. Ken Rosso ‘98, who
chaired one of these, dubbed his
break a “two-week whirlwind of sore
Vice, service—learning, and fun!"
Activities will include tours of local
globaljustice organizations, work in
soup kitchens. and camping at an
“Eco-Ranch."

“My trip to San Francisco hopes
to give students both volunteer Scrr
vtce opportunities and a glance at the
vibrant Iionrprofit community in the
Bay Area," said Rosso,

Last semester, Griniiell students prepared safe sex
packers for Friend: For Life.

Kissani ‘98, and Amanda Lynam ‘01
have coordinated a second excursion
to San Francisco, but plan to precede
it with a week's Visit to Southwest
cm New Mexico, where students will
spend time camping and doing clean
up work at a nature preserve.

“My experience on the Fall Alt
Break trip to Memphis was wondere
ful," said VanSaanen, “so this time
around I’m looking to make our time
in New MeXico and San Francisco
just as great! I’m excited,"

Grlnnellians will depart for their
destinations by charter bus the Sat-
urday spring break begins, alid return
to Iowa hopefully by the Saturday
before classes reconvene.

Housing could take place in a va»

the availability of space.

Rhoades expressed great enthusi;
asm for the program “I can't say
enough good things about Alternar
tive Break — the people you meet,
the work you do, and the friendships
you make," he said.

Larimer agreed, suggesting that
the excitcincnt of Griiiliellians is
what keeps Alternative Break alive
and well: “The overwhelming stur
dent interest is inspiring."

though I don‘t normally get involved
With politics, feel it‘s very imporr
Iant.” Lind, who grew up near an air
force base in Massachusetts was in
favor of armed U.S. intervention in
1991. Since then his views on US,
involvement in the Middle East has
changed. “I was very pro war in ‘91,
but after studying Arabic and taking
some classes on the near east at
Simon's Rock College, my views
changed dramatically.” Lind is also
glad to see Grinnell focusing on is,-
sues beyond sensational headlines,
“It seems like everyone on the news
is obsessed with President Clinton’s
penis. This is something that people
should care about, People will die
in Iraq that none of us will ever hear
abouL”

Grinnell protest veteran Cecily
Wagner '98 was proud to see
Grinnell's activism. '

“This means a lot to me. It seems
to me that the campus isn‘t as active
as it could be lately. I don’t think its
necessarily a problem with compla-
cency; students have their school
work to do. [Just feel that education
here is too academic» it doesn’t give
students time or impetus to allow
them to take what they are learning
in their books and put it into action.
For all of us who worked on this, I
know our academics suffered, but I
think it inspired us- [know itinspired

 

me. Nothing like this has happened
for along time."

 

 

 

 

 

 

The effort to bring about both the
discussion on Friday and the protest
on Monday was enormous. “I'm
sure well over 100 some hours were.
put into this between all of us," said
Brooke Heaton RISE, which was
founded in the spring of 1996 by
Heaton, Anne Walsh, Sonam Lama
Sherpa and Timur Rahman meets
weekly at 2 PM in the South Lounge
of the forum.

The RISE protest was in response
to United States threats to use force
against Iraq ifU,N, weapon inspec-
tors are not allowed access promised
to them by Sadaam Hussein in 1991

According to Thursday’s edition
ofThe Washington Post, 63% ofcitir
Zens polled supported United States
involvement in Iraq.
