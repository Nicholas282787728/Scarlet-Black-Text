while 1 duly appreciate lhc FM crew for

cleaning up our campus again, I was sad to see
that they're using all (ht: fallen branches to mark:

- wood chips. Really... wood chips? They don’t
even use wood chips on plilygmunds arrymnrel 1
think we should have had a big allreurnpus burr

much winner we would all feel after knowing
that we helped in the organic circle of lite tor

by curred college students isn't likely to Fly wirh
thc adrnrnisrrarinn or the ﬁre department, and it
will require a lot of lighter ﬂuid, but what else
do we have to do in this bitter, and boring, part
ofwintcr?

Not everyone is partying

Picture this: it’s the weekend. It’s been rain-
ing and snowing {or hours. The entire campus
has been without power for hours. There are
over 100,000 peoplo across lmvn without power
or heat. It’s the worst ice storm since 1975. And
what do Grinnell students decide to do? They
have a huge parry with hath beer and hard liquor.
They pull the the alarm and trash rhe building
They play music so loud that you can hear it three
ﬂoors above; all this while the town of Grinnrll
is still without power. Real classy, Grinncll, real

Kleenex invented for a reason

OK, while I'm brushing nry reerh, I hear guys
blowing their snot in rhe shower stall Come on,
guys! That is so repulsive, These are community
bathrooms! Save your snot blowing for when you're
home in your own bathroom. It’s even grosscr when
I hear- ir before 1 have to take a shower. Don’tjustify
it by “making sure it \‘mshes rlown the dritin."lust
don’t do ithujt ten minutes and use in Kleenex. It’s
probably not liln for the custodial stuff to clean up
either. Don’t blow your snot in the shower,
