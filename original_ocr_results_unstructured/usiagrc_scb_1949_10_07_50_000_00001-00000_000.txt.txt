The black veil of a contem-
porary campus mystery is made
translucent in spots only by
commissar of the Gadabouts,
Stu Roeder's statement, “Every
body might do well to study
the back page of Saturday
afternoon's football program."

It‘s a clue to the entertain-
ment plans of the Gadabouts’
first dance of the season, to be
held tomorrow night in the wo-
men’s gym at 8:30 pm.

Members of the Grinnell col-
lege faculty are cordially inc
vited to mingle with the stu»
dents at this affair, and listen
or dance to. as they deem nec-
essary and proper, the music
of Jack Davis and his band.

By Betty Gilman

“Remember that that wonder»
ful movie about boarding school
we saw two years ago?” asked
Ljudmila Lekan in a letter to
friends back home in Yugoslavia.
“If you do, you will realize, in
part, what my life in Grinnell
is like."

Milchi, a Loose Hall freshman
and one of Grinnell‘s three
European students, arrived in
New York September 10, 1949 at
10:00 a. m. “Until then 1 had lost
every hope of going on to
school,” she says remembering
the refugee student’s camp in
Austria, where she first made
application for a scholarship to
come to America to study. “I
wanted to, of course, but i
thought it would be impossible,"

All of the bubbling enthusiasm
and baoyancey characteristic of
college coed are characteristic of
Lgudmila too. “There is so much
to see, and do and experience,”
she says in amazement. “Each
day more and more of the pic—
tures from my Grinnell. pamph-
lets spring to life."

Living in,a dormitory is a
new experience for Milchi. At
most European schools the stu-
dents live in private homes, and
only eat together, “i really like
it this way, though," she says
very seriously. “Here the girls
live only a happy life. They are
so gay. so free from troubles and
sorrow. It is not like this at
home.“

Ljudmila early discovered the
alleAmerican sweet tooth:
“Americans like so many sweet
things." She also marveled at
lthe great variety of food in the

Clark men wore brown feath-
ers to suggest that it was doing
a stripetease. They declined to
display the symbolic skunk in
their clubroom. Cowles offered

Dibble a maggotty old crow for‘

Darrell lverson, Clark sopho-
more, was at classes when four
men called at his Grinnell farm
home Wednesday morning. “We

told Dan-ell's father. “We've de-

safer in Chicago, at George
Wollschlager’s home. Could we

Mr. lverson fetched the bird

years of high school English,
Milchi is quickly catching on to
