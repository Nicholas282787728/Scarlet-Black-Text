In the light of other plays given
recently on campus. Bricl Music
is hard to evaluate. We will be-
gin by saying that it was fine
entertainment that kept the aiir'
dience interested and amused. In
this respect it tar surpassed
Moor Born, but a comparison of
the two plays would be unlair,
since a period tragedy is much
more difficult to produce
a contemporary play.
Brief Music had not the cos
turning problems. the amount of
interpretative acting, or the deep
moodiness oi Moni- Born, so that

Brief Music “Interests and Amuses”

although Brier Music had a lnllchi
better audience reaction, it was'
undoubtedly a much easier play,
to give.

Carol Kelp, ns Spiff, gave prob-
ably the best performance of the
cvonrng, Not a character part,
skiit' had to be played straight]
and \Vth as much l‘eallsm as the
actress could muster. Miss Kelp
made of Spiff a person we all
would like to know, a real, be-
lievable girl with a strong sensr
‘of values. Her sacrifice for the
ihappiness of her roommate was,
ldone with restraint, without the,
flourish that might have made
it merely 'comic. Miss Kolp seems-
absoliitely at ease on the stage,l
moving and speaking ivith Hats;
uralness and poise.

Mary Ann Hursh's Drizzle was
lalso well done, and although at
itll‘ﬂes she seemed nervous. this
tecling rather fitted the Charac—
terization of the unhappy malad
justed girl, and thus did not de-
tract trom the performance. Her
suicide scene had just the right
combination of humor and path-
os, and her development into a
promising young authoress was
logically carried out.

Phyllis Plncus was a sarcastic
and hilariously funny Rosie. Her=
lines were delivered with they
devastating effect of a clean
quick sword thrust. She seemed
to be enjoying her part immense-
ly, and the audience enjoyed it
with her.

The eternal leftrwmger was
played by Roberta Ward, Her
comic rabblewousing Maggie was
a telling satire on its real-life
counterpart. and was very ader
lquately done.

Doris Marvm was
stock character in all colleges,
actual and imaginary. Always
appearing when not wanted, al-
ways tryuig to get "in with the
mob”, her last scene pointed the
real tragedy behind the lives or
all such persons.

clothes-conscious, man com
scious Minnie was portrayed by
Maxine Hay. who was the glamr
or girl of the production. With
little opportunity for dramatics,
Miss Hay handled the part well.
Her Minnie was a necessary ele-
ment to the true portrayal of
college life.

as a contrast. At times her re-i
