Community
service in the
Southern sun

We wanted our experience to be more than just
service. Part of an alternative break tn'p is the kind of
community you build with other people. With that in
mind, Sharyn and I planned the first part of our week
in hopes that it would be an intensive community
experience that would really develop the group.

We went to Collier Seminole State Park, just south
of Naples, Fl. The park is part of the Everglades. During
our time there, we did a variety of different kinds of
service- from park maintenance activities like splitting
firewood, to removing exotic species of plants in the
cypress forest that were destroying native plants and
damaging the naturalecosystem. During this ﬁrst week
we camped at the park and spent a lot of time with
the different park rangers.

Some really important developments came out of
this week. The first was that because of the nature of
our location and our work, we really got to know one
another as a group and were able to experience the
kinds of gifts we have that we don’t get to see at
school. The second was that our attitude for service
influenced others. The park rangers, people who stayed
at the park and even a bunch of kids from a group
home at the camp site next to us, were thrilled by the
idea that others would choose to serve. That in and
of itself had a major impact on us, and those around
us. Our service was more than the vines we pulled
down in the forest. It was the way that our actions

touched others people's lives.

In the second week, we changed focus and decided to
work on issues that directly involved people, in an urban
setting. We traveled to Tampa and worked with an amazing
nonprofit called Francis House. It is an organization that
provides comprehensive services to families afflicted or
affected by AIDS. It doesn’tjust provide band aid care, but
instead focuses on looking at the root of the problem and
how the individuals came to be in the circumstances they
are in now. They look to create systematic change. We split
our time helping with the care and maintenance of the
building, and caring for the young children who came to
preschool every day. These children were either afflicted or
affected by AIDS. They were beautiful and delightful, and
yet racing a life of far more uncertainty and heartache than
most people can fathom. On our last night of service, we
decided to do a peer education activity and did a night of
club outreach in Tampa. We distributed over 300 condoms,
and could dispensed hundreds more. We went to a club district
and talked to people on the streets. It was extremely
successful.

Over all, the service was deﬁnitely exciting and fulﬁlling.
But more important to me is the community that we built
amongst ourselves. We became a family. Even after returning
to campus, with all its work and different social ideals, we
are still a community. And that’s a gift.

The warmth of the breeze from the van window
seeped through allover me. I couldn't believe it. We
were in Florida! The pile ofsnow has been left behind.

Ididn’t except in advance that 1 would enjoy this
trip as much as I did, we (the group members) would
become attached as much as we are right now, and
the moment of service work would be as worthwhile
as it actually turned out to be. I felt that I had a
productive Spring Break, working forsomething besides
schoolwork and getting to know some Grinnellians I
would have never known outside of classrooms.

First of all, I desperately enjoyed the weather and
the environment which reminded me so much of home,
as I came from a tropical country. Iwas happy even to
see the mosquitoes and ants as those kinds of things
all came back to me as a memory of home. (But I later
decided that it was not very nice to have mosquitoes
after seeing the mosquito bites on Ericka’s leg),
Secondly, I think that the service we did was valuable.
it shed a light on where our standpoint is in the
community and ,more or less, it helped identify an
aspect of who we are and What we Want to do. Thirdly,
we learned how to function as a team, how to get
along with people of different personalities and
admired each others' strengths. This trip has shown
me so many things beyond my typical life at Grinnell.
