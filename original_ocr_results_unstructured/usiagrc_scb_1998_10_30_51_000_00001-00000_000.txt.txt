"October‘s bright blue weather" of
1998 belies the October that hit us all
squarely in the face a year ago, when a
humongous wet snowstorm forced
cancellation ofpractically all activities
including churchservices, social events
and ultimately school, and brought
whole trees and tree branches crashing
down around our heads.Grinnell and
the surroundingarealookedlike abattle
scene; you could not get to there from
here because of streets and roads
blocked by downed trees, and the Grin-
nell Public Works Department did val-
iant battle with the aftermath for weeks
aﬂerward.

Shades of Halloween, what did
Around see en route up Broad Street

orange lights crowning shrubbery and

nell home.

Whoever said that the Halloween
season approaches Christmas was not
understating the case.

Around hopes everyone was gcarcd
up forthe new season that started Sun-
day: The Daylight Savings Season,
Around‘s least favorite season ofthe
year, when it’s darkness practically at
noon, when clock timers have to be
moved ahead several hours to accom-
modate the early darkness, when bat-
teries need to be changed in smoke
alarms, when seasonal affective disor-
dersetsinforsomeandwhenAround’s
world seems to shut down for the next
six months. Not to be a grump, but
whycan'twc leave well enoughalone,
and use the same time throughout the
year?

Blessings on the lone bicyclist (who
looked suspiciously like Meg Jeffrey)
riding on Broad Street Monday
evening, the second day of daylight
savings time, with a light shining
brightly on her handlebar so that she
was clearly visible in the gathering
gloom of the new darkrat—S pm. sea-

One ofthe most terrifying moments
inAround'slifeoceurred oncyearago
on that same day when it turned a
comer in its automobile only to find
itself almost upon a covey of four or
ﬁveunlightedadultbicyclistsproccetl-
ing slowly up the street in coinradely
but very invisible fashion.

It was an eye opener on the imr
penance ofbcing extra careful in these

days of early darkness when pedestn-
ans and bicyclists are often upon our
streets and angels unaware of their
invisibility.

Dick Gustafson, a Gnnnellian who
is a field representative for the lowa
Department of Agriculture and Land
Stewardship, was one of those who

attended the 75th anniversary of the'

department Oct. 16 in the Wallace
Building at the Iowa State Capitol Com»
plex in Des Moines.

He shares with Around some in-
teresting agricultural facts comparing
1923, the date of the founding of the
department, with today.

The numberoffarms at thattime was
213,000 compared with 98,000 today.
The number ofacres farmed then was
33,28 million acres compared with
33,20 million acres today, and the av.-
erage fan-n size at that time was I60
acres compared to 339 acres today.
which all seemsto add up: Less fanns,
approximately the same number of
acres farmed and larger farms.

The total value of Iowa farm prod
ucts, however, has risen from $500
million in 1923 to $12.9 billion.

The number ofhogs on farms is very
similar, 15 million on Oct. 1, 1923,2nd
15,2 million on Sept. 1, 1998, while
the numberofcattle onJan, l ofcach of
those years has dropped from 4.34 mil-
lion in 1923 to 3, 75 million in 1998.

Comyield hasjumped from4l bushr
e15 per acre to 138 bushels per acre
while the price of corn per bushel has
risen from o2 cents to 32,52, probably
adropconsidei-ingthe relentless march
ofinflation.

Principal crops in that first year of
the department were com, oats and
wheat while today corn and soybeans
are the principal crops.

Compaiatively speaking,_ are these
the good old days orthe bad old days?

MICA managing a mountain of food

A food drive by eighth-graders at Grinnell Middle School last
week was so successful that Mid-Iowa Community Action’s Pow7
eshiek County Food Pantry was filled to overflowing. This trail of
Canned and boxed goods still was awaiting storage space. Shown
with the food are Dick Stockner, director of the Grinnell MICA
office, and Donna Weaver, 3 family development worker for the
agency.

An important election
deserves a good turnout

Judging by the number of yard Signs adorning Grinncll these days 7 and
by the number ofl‘eiters to the editor we‘ve received 7 there‘s plenty of
interest being generated this political season But a lot ofpeoplc who are
supposed to know about these things are predicting a low voter tumour on
Election Day this coming Tuesday.

That’s hard to understand. While it‘s true that the next presidential election
is two years away, there are plellty ofimportant races in 1998 For Iowans, it
means that anew governor will-be elected for the first time in 16 years. The
retirement ofTerry Bransrad means that residents ofthls statc (who tend to
stick with-govemors for more than one temi) will be deciding who's going to
lead the state into the next millennium.

Thetwo major-party candidates, Republican Jim Ross Lightt‘oot and
Democrat Tom Vilsack, are political opposites who have entirely different

 

' visions oflowa’s future. Until the last week or so, polls indicated a Lightfoot

landslide, But recent voter surveys show the race to be much closer. Onc poll
released Tuesday by the ViIsack campaign has the race dead even; at 44
percent each, That should energize both parties to get their voters to tlte polls
on Tuesday.

Incumbent Republican U S. Sen. Charles Grassley is said to have a huge
lead over his Democratic challenger, David esterbcrg, arid that race hasn’t
sparked a great deal ofinterest. But here in tlte 3rd Congressional District,

incumbent u,s. Rep. Leonard
Boswell, the Democrat who’s
serving in his freshman term, is
being challenged by conservative
Republican Larry McKibbcn,
Conventional ivistlom has it tlrttt a
member ofCongless has his or lter
toughcst i‘e-elcctlon battle after that
initial term, sothe race 151110 focus
of considerable attention, not only
in the district but nationally as well.

State legislative races also are interesting this time around. In the 29th
Senate District, incumbent Democratic Sen. Dennis Block is being clinl~
lcngcd by 3 Brooklyn Republican. Bruce Klroirdr stune animosity has crept
into this race, and both men are running vigorous campaigns.

Tlte 58th House Dlslrlct' so has produced a spirited contest. this one
between incumbent Republican state Rep. Danny Carroll and his Democratic
challenger, Kerry anlrt. Both have run wcllorgnriizotl campaigns, tlltd few
peoplc are willing to bet on the outcome,

I

lfsomc voters are apathetic. though, it's not all that stirpristrtg. Logic
would dictate that the importance oftlie races mentioned here would meant a
pretty good tunlout. But the mindless turd clidleso campaign commercials
have been numbing. Civility has been lacking iir rnaiiy nrccs, parllctllarly
those for govenior and Congress. in fact. it‘s not overstinrirg things to
suggest that this year's crop ot‘corrinrcrcrrils has pltullbccl ncw depths They
can’t help but alienate people who sincerely want to know tvhut u ctrndidtrtc
stands for, not what his or her opponent ullcgcdly hits done to deserve being
labeled a political pariah.

A month ago, pundits were suggesting that the Clinton sex SCillttlill would
be the driving force in this off-your election. Recent polls suggest that it's not
going to have much or r impact at all Here in Iowa, people cent more
concerned about issues Ii education, taxes and hog-lot odors rhrtn they are
about tlte president‘s ind . ‘lctluns.

The point is that this is a very important clccrrmt we sincerely hope [hilt
people Iravo taken tltc time to inromr themselves about how candidates stand
on the issues, their go to the polls on Tuesday and vote for those With whom
they agrco.

Iowans are going to have to make some important decisions about the
direction this slate Will take over the next decade or so. and Tucsrluy‘s
election will serve us rrn tlllporlillll step in that process,

Polls are open from 7 am to 0 pm 7 plenty tribute for voters to cxcr-crse
