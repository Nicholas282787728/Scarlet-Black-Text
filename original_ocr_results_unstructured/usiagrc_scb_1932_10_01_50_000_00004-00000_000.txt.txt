In First Quarter

Despite the fact that they held a
9-0 advantage at the end of thc
first quarter, Simpson college could
not cope with the last half attack of
the Drake university Bulldogs and
they went down to defeat, 31 to 9.

Simpson scored early when a bad
pass from center was downed back of
the goal line for a safety. Shortly af-
tcrward the Methodists ibcoved a
Bulldog fumble on the 19-yard line
and carried it over for a touchdown
four plays later,

In the second period, Drake piled
up an advantage, scoring twice to
lead 1279 at the end of the half. Just
as the gun ended the quarter. Macs
Farlane of Simpson dropped a beans
tiful 30-yard pass which would have
given Simpson another touchdown

In the last half Walter Thompson,
'dusky Drake back, got loose and the
blue and white tcam scored three
more tuchdowns to run their total to
31. Drake showed plenty of power,
but were unable to click at the start
of the game.

RADIO RAMBLINGS

With football curta aiscis check-
ed off the calendar and tho world
series tucked away for a year’s his
bernation, Saturday afternoon
waves are ready for af barrage of
firstrwater gridiron thrills. Ted Hus-
ing, ace sports mihcman. is p lishing
his best adjectives for exhibition on
Saturday, Oct. 8, when he will tell
the world about the Northwestern-
Michigan i-ray to be fought at Ann
Arbor. Mich. .

No powder-puff contest this. Big
Ten honors were split three ways
last year between these two and Pur:
due, each with five conference wins
and one loss. Northwestern emerged
from its schedule unbeaten, with a
scoreless tie with Notre Dame includ-
cd, but a Big Ten rule was waiv d
for charity’s sake, and Dick Hanley's
boys bowed to Purdue 770 in the rec
sultant post-Season game. Harry
Kipke's Wolverines should give
Northwestern a lousy afternoon, with
competent replacements to fill the
forward Wall's graduation gaps. The
two teams did not met last year.
Husihg will air the game over the
WABCrCollimhia chain starting at
1:45 p. in, EST, and songs of North-
western and Michigan will be broad-
cast during the lﬁrmihute “Football
Souvenir Programm" immediately
preceding.

From Ann Arbor, Ted travels to
Boston, whence he will recount the
Columbus day (Get, 12) intersection-
al contest between Boston college and
the Praying Colonels of Centre col-
lege, the little Kentucky institution
which once startlcd the football world
by humbling mighty Harvard.

Christy Walsh continues with his
stirring, actionrpacked All-America
football show on Friday nights (9 to
9:30 p. in, EST. WABC-Columbia
network). On Oct. 7 he interviews
that grand old man of college foot-
ball, A. Alonzo (”Fears Purdue")
Stagg, who brings his Chicago Ma-
roon’s to meet the Bulldogs of his Air
ma Mater at New Haven on the fol-
lowing aftemoon, Stagg has coached
the Maroons ever since his gl‘adlb
ation 41 years ago from Yale, when
Walter Camp named him as end on
the first All»AmeTican team, At New
Haven he was also a star pitcher,
once striking out 20 Old Nassau
sluggers in a YalePrinccton‘ ball
game. Dramatizations of thc prev-
ious Saturday’s biggest football mo»
ments by Harry von Zell. songs of the
colleges whose games will he re-
acted, as well as those of little Wi
liams in tlic Berk hires and big Stan~
ford on the Pacific coast, and Chris—
ty's first list of the week's ten best
individual players will complete the
offering.
