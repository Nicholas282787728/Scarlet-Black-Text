Slan'Feld Exhibii' Expresses
Life BeHer-Than Words

by Paul Kuntz

This is the writer’s first review of an art exhibition.
If you go to see Miss Sternfeld’s eleven paintings it may
be the first exhibition you’ve seen. We’re both new at this

sort of thing.

Communication between faculty and students is tradi-

tionally limited to words. Both lectures and

are known frequently not to
get across things worth saying.
Without words Miss Sternfeld
succeeds in communicating what
Okoboji Summer Playhouse is
like.

She makes you feel the back-
stage bustle, the thrill of open-
ing night, the relaxation of the
beach at noon. These are alive
in her paintings. Even if you
can’t remember them, as play-
ers can, you can imagine your»
self there, and it is as though
you are taking part.

Not that Miss Stemfeld is
a. human camera. Her range
of techniques make it possible
{or her to do what a camera
can’t. She can decorate, con-

vey impressions, express
moods, perform experiments
that go beyond the range of
illnstmtion. She is versatile.

See 1! you wouldn’t like one
'palnting tor your den, another
tor your dining room. Some
are intellectually exciting.
Others are emotionally sooth-
ing.

I do miss some kinds of
painting in this exhibit. There
are no nudes, by which some

of the vivid color. Paintings can
be both vivid and precise. Most
of Miss Sternfeld’s are. Her
ideas can be ielt directly. And
what she gives you to see incar—
nates her thoughts. its magic,
but white magic, not black.

Then I can’t say in Words
what she says in pointing. I’m
not sure I get all she has to
Say. But what’s not well Said
to me, my be just what you
get host. She makes me very
happy to have eyes. If you
don’t get what’s to be seen in
ﬂowers and. in shells, in
peaceful beaches and in lakes
at night, in chaos left by a
tornado, in u home built by
man, in a cathedral where a
nation crowns its queen, in
patterns of color that lepre-
scnt nothing, in. activities or
work and play, in mysterious
powers man expresses in idols
of gods, if you see nothing in
any of these, well then, quite
frankly, why have eyes?

One word more. Our Depart-
ment of Art has a lot of stuff
worth seeing. But Grinnell Col-
lege has no decent gallery. The

SCARLET AND BLACK

Foster Shows Sensitivity, Scholarship ‘
In Study of Purifanism and Stowe

by Grace Hunter

Written with sensitivity and thorough scholarship, THE
RUNGLESS LADDER, by Charles H. Foster is it study of
New England Puritanism and of Harriet Beecher Stowe
as a novelist who spoke "from fal‘ more deeply within the
New England tradition than Hawthorne.”

Readers of Professor Foster’s account of the inten-
sity of Mrs. Stowe‘s own religious experience, her under-

standing of the effect on hu-
man lives of Edwardean Cal-

vinism, her portrayal of New
Englund characters like those
who, in building a fence or do-
ing some other humble work,
would sweeten their labors
with a discussion of free will
and predestination, her realis~
tic and racy accounts of events
and conversations characterized
by the “doubleness” that makes
of New England humor sc de-
lightful a feature will very
likely hasten to the nearest lie
hrary to gather for himself the
riches to be found in The Min-
ister's Wooing, otutown Folks.
or The Pearl of Orr’s lslrnrl.
The reader who has always
thought of Mrs. Stowe as a
one—book woman. the author of
Uncle Tom’s Cahin. will be
amazed to see the impressive
series of sixteen volumes this
busy New England wife and
mother found time to write.
He will discover that in addi-
tion to the three books on the
slavery question, which inc
cludes A Key To Uncle Tom’s

ian life, and a hold vindication
of Lady Byron, a book which
“made Victorian England and
Victorian American reel with
shock and disgust.”

Recent critics of Byron, howe
ever, acknowledge that Mrs.
Stowe actually “inaugurated
the modern study of one of the
major romantic poets."

Not the least attractive fear
ture of this penetrating study
of Mrs. Stowe's motives and
methods of work, is the flexible,
fresh, and stimulating style in
which The Rungless Ladder is
written. The pondercus tech—
nique scholarship not

wearisomely present.
Rather, it is as if Proimsor
Foster emerges from his study,

bursting with enthusiasm and
delighting to reveal to stu—
dents and friends the essence of
his new insights into one of
America’s great writers in a
great period.
