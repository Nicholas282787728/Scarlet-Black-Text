Dear 5gb ‘

Voting locations

I am an independent voter wlro is a fervent sup-
porter of Barack Obarna for president, who cares
about local and state polrtics, and who almost always
agrees more wrth Democratre platforms. And even
though it may damn me on this campus,I will be vote
ing in Stillwatet, Minnesota (congressional district 6)
this coming election.

Iwrll be voting outside orowa because I do not
want Sarah Palin to think she can sway Minnesota
voters with her hockey mom status. 1 do not want
Minnesota, which currently holds the longes ‘tnte m,
cord ofvoting for the Democratic presidential mmp
nee (since John F. Kennedy), to swing red against the
candidate about whom I am more excited than I've
ever been. Finally,I most certainly do riotwant to see
Norm Coleman and Michelle Baehmann reelected
and to feel I did not do enough to help their Dem—
ocratiCrFarmerrLabor party opponents. 1 care about
these issues more than I care about local lowa politics.
Now, do not say my vote will count less in Minnesota.
My vote counts wherever I cast it because my vote is
a personal choice and, although numerically my vote
may count more in Iowa, ideologically my vote counts

more in Minnesota.

So, Campus democrats, ifyou want to have an iri-
formational session on why one should vote in Iowa,
if you want to distribute pamphlets wrtlr informar
tion about local raccsarrd wiry they matter to me, rt
you want to give students the opportunity to register
to vote rn lowa, please do so. I would support you
frilly in all those endeavors! But make sure to do so
without an accusatory argument, withorrt a pejorative
tone, and without making those of us exercising our
free rights [0 vote wherever we so choose feel some-
how morally defunct. Residcnce in two states means
we have a choice, not an obligation. In the coming
election I will be exercising this choice. saying “no" to
the Campus democrats, and voting in Minnesota,

Avoiding sexism

We write to bring your attention to the sexism
(however inadvertent) displayed in a particular poster
put up around the college campus last week to encour—
age support at the Grinnell football game. The poster
we are referring to said “Carroll is a girl’s name", This
statement is intended to be an insult to the oppos
ing team by associating that team with characteristics

historically given to females: weak, inferior and [ms
sivo, Brit as you can tell, displaying such a statement
reinforces the idea that these characteristics should be
given to females. Carroll is a woman’s name, women
are weak and inferior, and thus Carroll is weak and
inferior. We believe that most people agree that they
would never go up to a woman and say, “You are infer
rior to men”without serious retribution. In the future.
we would encourage everyone to avoid postcring such
statements and be cognizant of the meanings of the
statements you make. To continue to improve equality
of the sexes (especraily since at Grinncll we pride our-
selves on our open—mindedness and progressivcness)
we must be wary ofphrases and actions that put down
women We must also be assertive in drawing arten»
tion to rssues that appear to be sexist so we can persist
in promoting change on campus and elsewhere. We
encourage the Grinrrell College commrrnity to have
discussions about sexism in our culture and to take a
stand against actions that we find offensive or alarms
ing, whether sexism or any other issue.

If anyone lras any questions, concerns, or com-
ments about what we have said, please do not hesitate
to contact any one ofus.

Adventures in sketchiness: sex, lies, and the dining hall

Harsha Sekar ’08 courageously defen

ds his claim that he '

'n fact sketchy, despite allegations to the contrary

Amidst the arbitrary feedback I've
been receiving over last week’s prose,
one comment, in particular, has stood
out. “Harsha,1’m sorry, but you’re just
not sketchy."

To justify this claim. my incessant
critics use my young age, debatable
class status,anrl general lackofanyperr
turbiug or even remotely intimidating
qualities as evidence. ,

Now this is a compliment, don’t get
me wrong, but t'm alum now, and I‘ve.
resolved to become sketchy, Hopefully,
these shenanigans will show you what
I’m made of.

Linen-y

Most Grrnuellians have never
fraudulently checked out a book from
Burlirig. To be fair. it was on reserve.
and I needed it for class. The person
who scanned my P-card was a distant
acquaintance, and when she intorrrred
me that for some reason or the other
it wasn’t workr I just looked back at
her qu cally. lslmm, i wonder wiry
that could be,"l said, puzzled

Before I coulti lapse rnto one ormy
standard prevarrcatrons, slrc diligently
apprised the reference librarian ot' the
situation. “I know him, he's in nry
class," she told thc woman, who recti-
fied the situation with he scanner and

computer, and, under false pretenses,
loaned me the book.

I sat there and read it, feeling like an
idiot. I needed to explain to them why,
most likely, my P-catd was malfunc-
tioning. 1 left the library with the book
and frcrrctically told every acquarntarrcc
I passed about my sin, attempting to re»
licve my conscience.

“Don’t worry about it, just return
it," everyone kept
telling me.

1 was going
to get in trouble.
Soon the police
would arrive,
cuff me, put me
into an imita-
tion \W/E-
style hold, (a wet
dream for a handful oflaw enforcement
members), and throw me in the brick of
their car, turn on the lights and the Si’
rcn, and stare at me, while I sat behind
the ﬁshing nct hauler, still thinking
that its al a dream.

When l returned the hook, iried to
convey thatI was taking a rrglc class
and was "finishing" in December, and
that that was probably the source oftlie
P-card problem But she took the book
and began tcncling to the other stu-
dents in line before 1 could dimlgc the
rest, Oh,\vel| So much for that.

Adventure: in r/wtcfiincrr #2: Cheer/2
and C/erg

When I arrived in town, i had some
logistical issues pertaining to my apart-
ment. I couldn’t move in right away. so
I stayed with various friends. One of
my friends, I’ll call him Clieech, had a
roommate, who I’ll call Chong. Chong
had a significant other, with whom of
late, he was spending an inordinate
amount of time.
He began sleeps
irrg in his part
ner’s room, one
night and then
another, and .it
soon became roll-
tine.

Sleeping on
couches is great
for mid-afternoon naps and simrlar ens
deavors, but I can never seem to get .r
good chr’s sleep on out. so Chongs
habit, tircrcrorc, worked out great rot
me. Rather than resorting to the couch.
i got to sleep on the empty bed. The
practice was methodical, rosombhrrg a

Fortunately, Chong turned out to be
remarkably horny. But he would always
linger back into the room sometime
around midnight and stay there for a
while. “c’mon, man, go back to your
ladysfrieiid. Cirong, c'mon, sleep over
there agairr,"l would think to myself, as
he would sit at his desk, collecting his
things, Soon, 1 was rooting for Chong
every night, hoprng that he would get
laid, fearing that he wouldn’t. “C’rnon

Dining Hell

Ok y, t‘rnc, most people have
sneaked into the dining hall before.
But few have been caught. “1 came
with him," 1 repeated to my inter-
rrrgator scvcral times, pointing to my
cartontpirator, who nodded anxiously.
She didn't believe me, And when she
went to ask thc person who scans the
Prcards,l ran away.

Sketchy enough for you?
