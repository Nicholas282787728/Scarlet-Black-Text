program of pieces by American
composers The Trio submitted
three different programs to the
State Department which in turn
submitted the programs to
American embassies in the various
countries where the Mirecourt 'h‘io
was to perform. Two of the
programs were traditional, but the
responses were overwhelmingly in
favor of the program of American
music, which includes piano rags
and selections from Goltschaw.

European cities, the Trio hopes to
do substantial research. According

POYNTER'S

by Janet Pope

Traveling from city to city,
sleeping in a diiterent motel room
every night, and living out or a
suitcase on $2521 Week is the kind of
life Jon Neiderbach has known for
the last four months. Neiderbach, a
sophomore on a semester leave,
has been working on presidential
hopeful Morris Udall's campaign
staff. But he'is tired of that life
now. Last week he was in Grinnell
on his way home to California.

Emphasizing that he is in no way
disillusioned with Udall, Neider»
bach said, “I really believe Morris
Udall will be the next president of
the United States. He's definitely
one of the three candidates in the
running for the nomination.”

Last semesler Norma Matthews
of the Udall office in Des Moines
told Neiderbach that he Could get
his expenses paid on the Udall
campaign. Atthat point. he was not
satisfied with school, so he decided
to lake 3 semester off.

After phone canvassing in
California in December, he came
to Iowa to campaign before the
January caucuses. Commenting
about Udall’s Iowa caucus support,
Neiderbach said, “I was very
pleased with how we did here,
considering the tremendous
organization Harris had."

When the Iowa caucuses were
over, Neiderbach took a bus to
Somerstorth. New Hampshire,
which he described as a factory
town of 10,000 people. He and an
Oberlin student pushed Udall for
three and a half weeks prior to the
February 24 New Hampshire
primary.

Next. Neiderbach traveled to
Massachusetts and worked for a
week distributing leaflets, In
Wisconsin he coordinated 3
Milwaukee telephone canvas.

joins Udall

campaign

Grinnell students‘Dave Kathan
and Linda Cornelius also worked
briefly in the Wisconsin campaign.
Kathan was In Green Bay for a
week and a half and Milwaukee for
four days. He did routine campaign
work: leafletting, telephone
canvassing and stuffing envelopes.
Cornelius said that she visited her
sister in Milwaukee and worked on
a telephone survey for two days,

Udall finished Second in both the
New Hampshire and
Massachusetts primaries behind
Jimmy Carter and Henry Jackson
respectively. Newspapers around
|he country declared Udall the
winner in Wisconsin before all the
votes were tallied. However, tinal
figures showed that Carter had
won the Wisconsin primary by one
percentage point.

Neiderbach Said that. the last
couple oi days heiore a primary or
caucus got “pretty insane. mostly
because everyone was so nerr
vous,” However, at other times, he
said, the pace was not so irenzied
and most people got tive or six
hours of sleep a night.

For Neiderbach, campaigning
was a good experience “It was
tremendous experience. I learned
a whole lot about me personally
and a hell of a lot about cam»
paignsihow Informal they are,
and how easy it is to get very in-
volved," he said.

However, Neiderbach said that
he saw Udall only about five times
and never had a chance to talk to
him, “I can definitely see a plus in
working for a local candidate,"
Neiderbach commented

Young people make up most of
Udall s campaign staff, ac-
cording to Neiderbach. “I’d say
about [wosthirds of his staff are
under 25. The top positions are held

by people around 30 or 35," he
stated.

“Very new politics" was the
term Neiderbach used to describe
Udall’s approach. He pointed out
that Udall is the only one of the
liberal Democratic presidential
candidates now in serious cons
lention for the nomination. Neither
George Wallace, Sargent Shriver,
Birch Bayh nor Fred Harris have a
chance, according to Neiderbach.

He did not. Seem to think that
Henry Jackson had much oi a
chance, dismissing him as the
rcpresentative of the conservative
wing of the Democratic party.

Neiderbach did not believe
Carter will be a problem for Udall
as the campaign progresses.
“Carter is going nowhere these
days. The bubble around Carter is
beginning to burst. Jimmy Carter
is all smile and no substance and
people are beginning to realize it,"
he stated.

Neiderbach said that Udall is
addressing the issues. He is
dealing with economic issues and
”in regards to integrity and
honesty he is lar and above any
other candidate.”

Neiderbach said that Udall can
win against Ford. A race between
the two would be a “clear choice.”
he said, “it would be the difference
between having an active govern
ment and a passive one, between
one that fights for the individual
and one that sits back and lets big
business run things.”

Neiderbach plans to come back
to Grinnell next semester. But first
he Will do some more campaigning
for Udall. “I’ll probably organize
in Santa Rosa, a town of about
60,000 near my home," he ex-
plained.
