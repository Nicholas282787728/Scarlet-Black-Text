movements of Army personnel. So, the
Army had the college declare the
dorm unfit for habitation and proceed
ed to expand the operations center
during the past summer Isn't the
psychology department Still in Good
now?

Furthermore, the price ot a Grinnell
education IS increasing at such a rate
that it will be prohibitive In the near
tuture; witness not only the tuitlon
and activities fee increase, but also
the over loo percent rise in laundry
costs and last year's cutback In t’inan»
cial aid. These are all calculated
moves to discourage students from
seeking an education at Grinnell.
Eventually, the campus will be

transformed into a hardened missile
site.

One of the most earthshattering
revelations is that tlle Building and
Grounds crew Is not made up of
maintenance men They are, in :10-
tuallly, Army intelligence agents This
should clear up many questions cone
cernmg BStG. Does it make sense to
have a maintenance crew of slow,
bumbling men? of course not’ Real
maintenance men would know What
they are doing, these Army intelligence
clowns have no conception or
maintenance Work at all,

Other strange occurrences are at-
tributable to the Minuteman III
missile on campus. The Highway a

detour outside of town is not due to a
damaged bridge, but rather to the tact
that the Army is installing directional
radar to track the path of our missile.

' The new ham radio tower is also part

of the radar directional system, Fur-
thermore, KDIC will have to move up
the FM band next February. This will
leave the lower end of the FM band,
open for broadcast with no in-
terference. Apparently our little ten
watt station is interfering with the Ar-
my s communication needs. '

One last note the salt shakers 1h the
dining halls have been consistently
empty. I have learned that this' is the
college’s way of informing us of théir
opposition to SALT n.

editorially speaking :

Remember when you were trying to decide where to go to college? As you paged through the ,
Yale Daily News’ Insiders‘ Guide To Colleges you came across this description of a place called ’

Grinnell College.

The piece said something like: you’d expect to find a really staid, boring college in this quiet
Iowa townibut when you visit Grinnell you’ll be pleasantly surprised. You’ll find a place with a ,
brimming social calendar and interesting, opinionated students and faculty. Remember that? _

Well, the description was at least half correct. Grinnell does have an excellent social calendar.
The campus can boast one of the nation 5 top chamber music ensembles. Thanks to Social Ac-
tivities Counselor Georgia Dentel, Grinnell is still treated to the tops in popular music jazz touring
plays dance companies. .the list is long.

But what about the exciting, interesting people? Look around and see how many you can find.

Try the obvious places.

Look in the letters section of the S & B. Wait a second, you say, there is no letters section this
issue. That’s right. There is no letters section this issue. ’

Why you ask? Apparently those interesting, opinionated people would much rather keep those
ideas to themselves than share them with the campus. Last week there were quite a few letters
But thinking back on those letters, the bulk of them were commenting on Dave Blatt 5 disco col-

Uml’l.

Maybe that should tell us something: disco is the burning issue on the Grinnell campus. Or
maybe there was just nothing worth commenting on..,
But looking closely, one sees that there is much worth commenting on. George Drake recently
announced an administrative reorganizationia move which, he now admits, did not take into ac- .
count all of the factors he now sees are there.
The S & B ran an editorial that sternly critiqued that decision, The editorial said that Drake’s
explanations for the changes didn t make sense. Apparently Joint Board agreed, and requested that
Drake give a better explanation for his move

Drake complied, and answered questions posed by Joint Board members last Wednesday. But his
answers were basically reiterations of what the S & B reported two weeks ago; nonetheless, most
Joint members seemed satisfied. At least the president had come and answered questions, which'. is
more than could be said for some presidents. ,

But his answers illuminated nothing—and most students seem satisfied with them Yet what 15‘ .
most upsetting is the lack of campus comment on the issue. ’

If students and faculty accept Drake’ s explanation why didn’ t they complain about the S & B‘ 5
editorial treatment? We still stand by our original editorial. Where are the interesting, opinionated
students the lnsidcrs’ Guide talked about?

It s not like there is no forum for such discussion: the message “from the editor’ in the past two-
S & B issues has offered our letters pages for just this purpose The offer still stands '

The Yale Daily staff was certainly right about the social program at Grinnell—it is exceptional.
But one is best advised to reserve judgment on the second half of the statement. All the votes have

yet to be counted.
