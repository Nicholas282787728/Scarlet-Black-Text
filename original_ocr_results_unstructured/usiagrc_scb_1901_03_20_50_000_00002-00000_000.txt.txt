HE SmithrEverett society of
Simpson has seen ﬁt to de
clare off its debate with the
Chrestomathian society. This is
very unfortunate, not only for the
Chrestomathians, but also for
Simpson, as it places lhem in a
most nnenviable position. our
debaters have been putting forth
all their energies for several weeks
in preparing to defend their side
of the question, when suddenly
their labors are brought to naught
by their opponents’ decision not
to debate. To us, such a deter-
mination appears decidedly dis»
courteous and inconsiderate. The
reasons given by them in extenue
ation do not appear at all satistae
tory or convincing. A situation
must be very bad indeed before
such a step can be detended. An
intercollegiate compact is oi such
a nature that the parties thereto
should consider seriously and feel
amply justiﬁed before measures
are taken to violate or annul it.
Whether the reasons advanced by
one party are sufﬁcient or not, can
be determined only by both the
institutions concerned. It is the
heightotarroganceorindirtcrence
for one party arbitrarily to an—
nounce that it cannot live up to
its agreement. This is what the
Smith-Everett society did in ieale
ity. It entirely disregarded the
fact that the Chrestomatllinn sot
eiety might. at this late date, be
inconvenienced to a very great
degree by such an action, and to
all appearances, considered only
its side of the matier. Such a po-
sition is not at all in accord with
our conception of the spil-itthat
should exist between colleges and
animate them in their relations
with each other.

Mr. H. H, Hart.

Next Sunday we shall have the
opportunity of hearing Mr. Has-
tings H. Hart, state superintend-
ent of the Illinois Child Home
and Aid Society. For ﬁfteen years
Mr. Hart was state secretary oi
the Board of Charities and Cor-
rection of Minnesota; has served
as president of the National Corie
ference of Charities and Correc-
tion, and for several years as gen-
eral secretary of that association.

The Illinois Child Home and
Aid Society was organized in $97.
The effort of the organization is
to place dependent children in
private homes, in the ‘majority of
cases securing their adoption.

Mr. Hart is a thorough student
of the childrsaving problem and
has probably done more than any
other man to secure the iecogni»
tion of the practical and scientiﬁc
principles on which the work of
childrsaving should be conducted.

Mr. Hart will speak at the Con-
gregational church morning and
evening, and berorc the students
at four o’clock in the chapel. lIiis
Sunday evening address will be
illustrated by stereopticon views.
showing the problenisconironting
the societ . He comes to Grine
nell on invitation of Pres. Maim
and especially to address the stur
dents. This opportunity is one
all should improve.

Professor Almy’s Vacation.

No protessor in Iowa College
has been more faithful in his work
for the college than Professor
Almy since he came to Griiinell
in i393 to take charge of the
physics department. The exec-
utive committee of the board of
trustees has recommended that a
leave of abscnce be granted to

him, and this will probably be
done at their next meeting. Pro-
fessoi' Almy will study during the
summer at the University of Chie
cage. \It his leave of absence
should be granted, he has no in-
tention of going to Europe but
will pursue his studies in this
country.
