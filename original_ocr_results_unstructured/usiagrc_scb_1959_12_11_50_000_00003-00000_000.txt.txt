felt and we relt and that made
‘ the dinner so much fun. A ride
on the shoulders and a hand, to

they meant a lot to many oi

you responded proved that col.

Too often in the rush of class
work, exams, parties, etc, we
iorgct the joys and simpli ty
or childhood and the iaith
and love associated with them.
The chapel sermon given by
Reverend Maitland oi Carleton
several weds ago, emphasiz-
ing tint as we grow older we
should not lose the feeling of
expectancy that is the driving
force oi childhood, expressed
very well what we are trying

y to say.

The enthusiasm and energy
shown by .these kids, whether
dirtyefaced or shiny-nosed,- rich

,or poor, is something to be en-
vied, and we think that all of
us attending the dinner came
,away a little happier for having
shared the evening.

Cont. irom p 2

oonslderlng cleaning up my
playroom planning in my mind
how i would put all the play

and chains away in the right
places, my mother would some-
times come in and,
terrible mess, instruct me (in
the best possible suggestively
critical way) to clean it up.

i would turn purple with
rage, grind my spitefulslittle
teeth in wrath and swear to,
die before cleaning it up; I
would live in the cluttered
room ior weeks. I felt I had
been cheated out or the vain
glory I would have received
irom cleaning it up without
being told.

I have suggestions to make
concerning the improvement or
.women's government in the best
or all possible quads. But why
make them? Why spoil good
Iideas by stating them? Someone
lwith authority may happen Dns
to them by accident (because
of superior intellect, of course)
and make something out of them
(to his or her credit). It is
clear what would happen to an
idea on Women’s government it
~it were unfortunate enough to
be suggested by me, -

Most everyone is dedicated
on this campus, dedicated to
the project or building his or
her own ego, and everyone
is thus bound by principle to
negate, soon at, mock, criti-
size or (better yet) ignore
any new idea (good or bad)

Irom anyone else —,their per-
sonal ego thus ﬂoating nearer
the surface or the cesspool oi
egoism, the waters at which
are odiously relative.

What could be more. degrad-
ing for a sovereign group
(slightly pompous) than to fol-
low meekly the instructions or
atoppish journalist? Why should
they capitalize on his idea? He,
not they, would get the credit.
They would have been com-
pletely dominated, faxed, and
(they would feel) cheated.
Would sovereign might personi—
fled allow itself to he ordered
around by a foppish journalist?
Not The idea would die because

I touched it.
