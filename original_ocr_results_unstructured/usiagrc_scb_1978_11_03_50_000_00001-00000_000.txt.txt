Waste continues to trouble

by John Strauss
Although waste is a pervasive

and intricate problem lor the
Grinnell community, attempts to
curtail the problem are being
made in several areas.

There are four major types of
waste on campus: food waste,
paper waste, heating and cooling
wastes tincluding the misuse of oil,
natural gas and electrical powert
and architectural wastes. Each
area has specific problems which
are peculiar to it.

Food waste is the most obvious
misuse of resources by students.
Food Service Director Dave Mc-
Connell sees three types of waste in
this area: 1) waste in the
production and cleaning of
products; 2) waste associated with
poorly prepared icod; and 3) waste
of products which does not stem
from preparation. The first two
areas result in a negligible
amount, according to McConnell,
but the third category costs
thousands of dollars per year.

THIS son'r or waste happens
when students pick up too much
food in areas such as the Salad bar
dessert line or beverage area
“It's incredible what is left
because someone takes ulree of
something instead of two. . . This is
our biggest problem," claims
McConnell. This waste results in
the loss of as much as 60 pounds 0!
food per day»in terms of dollars
and cents, $10,000 per year.

McConnell feels the problem lies
primarily in the apathy of students
and the difficulty in making them
aware. The Food Service Com-
mittee will focus on the problem of
waste in the near future but Mc-
Connell feels that the ultimate

solution lies with the entire student
body. “lndividuals' commitments
to the idea to conserve should be
the impetus to keep things going
They gripe but they areict willing
to make the Commitment to do
something about it.” However

McConnell believes it is hard for -

students to think about waste While
trying to “maintain academic
success.”

LIKE FOOD WASTE, paper

waste appears an easily remedied
problem, but according to SGA
PreSldent Greg Youtz, this isn’t the
case. .
At the present tim° there is no
recycling activity on campus. in
the past there have been students
in each dorm in charge of
distributing recycling boxes, These
people sorted the paper into
recyclable-nonrecyclable piles and
the paper was then taken to
recyclers in town,

This year however there is no
dlirm conservation activity. Also
the paper in the post oiiice, where
nostpaper waste occurs, is simply
)eing thrown away. it amounts to
tons of paper a year.

According to Youtz there is no
one to take the paper. The
recycling company that used to
take the paper has gone out oi
business. Last year, when the
company folded and the recycling
program was still alive, the paper
was driven to a recycling center in
Marshalltown. Transporting the
waste proved too expensive, and
the same problem still exists
today.

again it the costs are minor but
we’re somewhat cautious because
of 'last yak. It sounds terrible to

Investment morality revisited

by Bob Mitchell

Since last year’s campus cone
troversy over college investments
in South Africa, Grinnell's trustees
have demonstrated a cautious
approach to the lssues of
divestiture and proxy voting in
regard to human rights issues

In fact, the trustees have voted
against 12 different shareholder
resolutions which sought to reform
corporate policies involvmg South
Africa and other governments
charged with human rights
Violations.

MEANWIIILE. student interest
in these issues at Grlllnell seems to
have diminished, But students at
other colleges, most notably
Carleton, have prompted adoption
oi a more icrcelul approach, in
cludlng limited divestiture and
introduction of proxy resolutions,

Under the policy Carleton
adopted this fall the trustees can
divest Stock iii banks which make
loans to the South African
government and its public cor»
porations Also. in certain in»
stances, the trustees can sponsor
or cosponsor proxy resolutions.

A SHAREIIOLDER for proxy)
resolution occurs when any snare
holder makes a proposal cone
cc; in operating pi-occuurrs lor
the temptation. The propos l is
then voted on by all oi the s are»
holders

Carlctnn‘s plan also allows
divestiture if tht‘ ti'ustccs deters

trade off time and effort with
conservation. At any rate we won’t
do anything until second
semester." Youtz states,

Paper and iood waste are areas
where students can definitely have
an effect, but in the areas of ar-
chitectural problems and heating
and electricity conservation
students have less control

ARCHITECTURAL deficiencies
in the dorms and other campus
buildings are being smoouled over
one by one as the renovation
program continues.

Goodnow Hall’s problems are
representative of many older
buildings on campus. Michael

adhering to the Sullivan principles.
The Sullivan principles were

CARLE’I‘ON'S POLICY
promises to be “the lnosl radical
investment policy of any US.
college that has anything to lose,”
said one Carleton trustee.

The Gl'lnnell trustees, however.
continue to support the policy
opposing divestiture which they
adopted at their meeting last
November At that meeting, the
Board, responding to student
pressure, decided to release a list
of the college's investments Also,
the Board authorized trustee Fritz

Maytag inow chairman of the
Boardt to monitor shareholder
resolutions under the title of
”investment responsibility of»

divestiture

procedure set by the trustees,

college has received to the trustee

The proxies are also made
available ior examination by
students. The investment officer
then studies each resolution, waits

Community and finally sends the
resolutions to members of the
trustees‘ finance Committee with a
recommendation on whether or not

Flasher caught?

During break Grinnell police
arrested a man who they believe is
responsible ior the recent flushing
incidents. Initially booked on theit
of record albums, the suspect was
later identiﬁed by several of the
flashing victims.

Events leading up to his arrest
occurred last Tuesday. Steve
Potter, Howard Weissman and
David Hall wcnt to Weissmans
room that afternoon to listen to

Roman. technician in psychology,
says the main problems are wasted
space and poor construction which
increases fuel wastes.

“Either rooms are too cold or too
not We need heaters in the winter,
it’s so cold you can see your breath
in some rooms," says Roman,
There are no storm windows or
:urtains on the windows, plaster is
falling irom walls and water seeps
through the loundations, making
the basement useless at times.

records. Upon entering the room.
Weissman noticed that about a
third of his records were missing

ME AND ills friends quickly
went into the hall and asked if
anyone had seen anyone
suspicious, Freshman Marg‘aret
Wiebe said that while she was in
lhe shower she heard someone
moving around in the bathroom
When she asked who the person
was, she received no answer.
Looking out oi the shower, she saw
a man put a towel over his head
and leave.

Walssman and friends moved
quickly. They caught up with a
man whom Wiehe identified as the
man she had seen in the bathroom,
When‘Weissman questioned the
man about the albums, the suspect
denied any knowledge of them.
While Hall called the police the
others let' the suspect go.

BUT WHEN HALL returned,
they decided once again to follow
the man. This time they caught up
with him near Mears and found
him loading Weissman’s albums
ontoa moped. They took his license
plate number and again let him go,
Later the police picked up the
suspect,

Although the man had not
ﬂashed Wiebe, the police decided
to check out the possibility that he
was one of the flashers. Several
people who had encountered the
flasher identified the man.
Grinnell Police Officer Jay
Stevenson remarked that although
not all of the flashing victims
identified the man, he nonetheless
feels that he has enough positive
identifications to file a charge of
indecent exposure

ALREADY CHARGES of [are
ceny have been filed.

The suspect is an lbryearold
Grinnell resident who has a history
of problems with the police
department. Although Stevenson
feels that the man is the only
ﬂasher, he has not ruled out the
possibility that there is another
person responsible for some of the
incidents. Some women have
reported mat they were accosted
by a so to 40—year~old man.

HE STEESSES that campus
women should still take -

precautions when showering and

should call the police as soon as
possible if another flashing in-
cident occurs. .
