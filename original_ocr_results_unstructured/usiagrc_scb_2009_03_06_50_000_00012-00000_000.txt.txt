Don’t let the economic crisis Change the art programs

A monumental tragedy in both the histories of American art
and higher education took place a few months ago in the Boston
suburb ofWilltham,MassachusettsTliere, the administration at
Brandeis University announced their intention to sell offrhe en-
tire collection of their renowned Rose Art Museum—easily one
of the most distinguished academic museums in the nation. Not
unexpectedly, the administration has garnered criticism fiom
academia as well as artists and now must face interventions from
the Massachusetts Attorney General's Ofﬁce

In this economy, it's essential to prioritize. But I'm scared
our president and our trustecs will adhere to the thoughtlessaess
of the recent past and leave the students the short end of the
stick. The signs aren’t good Russell
Osgood’s January letter to the stile
dent body addressed the economic
climate but insisted on the usual
tuition increases, Contrary to what
he’d like us to believe, tllese incrcr
mental increases do not constitute
universal precedent. Last Septem-
her, university of Vermont president David Fogrl bragged to
the New York Trim about the fact that their tuition has actually
decreased Since 2002.

It’s unreasonable to ask students and their families to Slwlll’
dcr more fees while our president and administrators continue
to take home exorbitant salaries and bonuses. A few weeks ago
the C/yl‘mzit'leﬁl' ngm Edna/ion published a study identifying
Griuncil's treasurer, David S. Clay, as the tenth highest paid col—
lege CEO. in the country. Clay pockets a whopping $540,649,
roughly equiimlent to the full tuition of 15 students, Osgood

earns a similarly bloated salary.

As they amass a corporate-level pay, the endowment is tak-
ing a nosedive, having lost around $800 million in the last four
months. Iowa senator Chuck Grasslcy put it best: "In these hard
economic times, apparently beltstightening is for families and
students, not university presidents. "

Now morc than ever, the administration should pay attcnr
tion to student concerns. It's about time we fund wind turbines,
one ofthe finest ideas I've seen in my tour years here. There’s
little equivocarion heremthe wind energy would be economi-
cally beneficial in the long teiin and would adhere to our increasr
ingly battered Mission Statement. But the students in Free the
Planet have had to engage in Piipagcnor
style pleading to get any administrators
to budge. still lacking adcquate huiding
oi concern, the project remains incom-
pletc.

To thcii credit, the administration
does seem to have promoted the arts. I
spoke with Dan Strong, assistant curar
rot or the Faulconer gallery, who informed me that though the
budget for Faulconer has decreased since 1999, administrators
have been supportive. Lesley Wright, the curator, also vigor-
onsly dercndrd the administration in a long email I learned
that Russell Osgood is apparently some sort otlowiin version of
Cosimo tlc'Mediei, as he too has been an unwavering patron of
Faulconcr, Acknowledging this, it's important to maintain the
trcad by continuing lo invest funds in Faulconer and our come
munity ofartists.

To do all these things, we'll have to cut the unnecessary

goodies‘7plasmn TVs, extravagant construction (Nollen House,
Macy House, 8th Ave.) and administrator pay. We can also learn
from the misadventures ofthe admission ofﬁce, now a model for
irresponsibility. Back when the endowment scared, the admis
sion folks could have invested in more aid for needy students,
Instead, they indulged in a costly publicity campaign, resulting
in their risibly delusional new slogan, “No Limits." The product
ofhired consultants, “No Limits” is about as dishonest as Presir
dent Bush's “Mission Accomplished" spectacle was in 2003. The
brochures themselves serve as nothing more than a gloriﬁed acid
trip, replete with rapid, hallucinatory images like the now inns
moiis painting within a painting.

There's a painfully larger significance here, and that’s the fact
that these eluswl: “limits” are actually very real-ville adminis-
tration has just chosen to ignore them. The fact of the matter
is that the endowment exists to cushion the College in tough
times, something they know. They could change with the times
by using Picsident Ohama's economic agenda as a macrocosr
mic model for our scllool. Obiuna's plan seeks to alleviate those
citizens in the most pain with a large stimulus package while
simultaneously balancing the budget in the long teiin by cutting
wasteful spending, Likewise, the administration should invest a
huge chunk or our endowment in tuition relief and aid, creative
student—led projects like wind turbines, and the preservation of
our cultural institutions,whilc eliminating the nonsense.

Most impoitant of all,we have to chuck faicical, self—aggran-
(\lzing mottos like “No Limits” and its revised successol,“A Road
to Endless Possibilities,"because it’s crucial that the administﬁk
tion soon comes to terms with their limits and starts dealing with
reality,

Two ideas about how to increase popularity of Lyle’s Pub

The Campus Pub, like many firms thcsc days, struggles tor
customers. However, unlike many other businesses, Lyle's does
not qualify for a bailout from the federal government; the base-
ment operation simply is not big enough.

Nevertheless, the management there has designed some
methods to rectify their losses, the most successful being the
First Fridays program with Student Afr
fairs, where Student Affairs provides free
food to all patrons and limited alcohol to _
patrons of age on the first Friday of every '
month,

And while the First Fridays program
has admirably boosted Lyle's food sales,
one would hope that the Pub could move beyond receiving sub-
sidies in order to stay in business. Thus, I offer a few ideas.

Hopefully they will help reduce the Pub’s dependence on ad-
ministration funds, The theme to these ideas: tie Lyle’s more
directly to that institution Grinnellians go fanatical for every
week, Harris.

Firstly, the campus pub should heavily advertise its evening
hours, especially for weekends. Now that the Spencer Grille
closes at midnight every day, Lyle's has an opportunity to pick
up that venue's former patrons, paiticlllarly from Harris. Harris

parties typically end at l a.m. and prior to this semester swarms
oi’inebriated, costumed party-goers would surge upon the Spei‘r
cer Grill to purchase food, presumably in greater quantities than
they would ifsober.

However, now that the Grill no longer serves past midnight,
these crowds must dissipate among the dorms in order to fulfill

their still hungrybecrrawash stom-

achs. Lyle’s should fill these stom-

achs instead. We all know that the

' Pub must match its alcohol sales to

nonealcohol sales in order to serve

those under 21, so there’s no doubt

they could use the money from

food. To boost their after-midnight revenue, Lyle’s should put

up posters to emphasize this fact, with a particularly high con—

centration ofposteis around the Harris area. Party—goers might

notice the posters on their walk out from Harris, and on drunken
impulse follow them to the pub.

Secondly, the campus pub should try at every opportunity to
provide the ACErmandatory food at Harris parties. As it stands
now, all Harris parties must provide at least $25 worth of food
pcr tapped keg, and consequently, most Harris organizers pur-
chase their food from the ﬁrst oft-campus supplier that comes to

mind—such as Jimbo‘s pizza.

But this does not have to be the case.’l‘he food provided by
Lyle’s Pubipretzels, garlic bread, etc.~could eaSily substitute
iirnbo's pizza in terms ofalcohol absorption, Since Harris par
ties typically occur at least once a weekend, and generally feature
about two kegs, this source could boost revenue on average by
550 a week, Additionally, since Harris food is often paid for
by the SGA All Campus Events committee, Lyle's should con-
tact the ACE Coordinator Celeste Larkin about obtaining a free
good word at ACE budget meetings. The power of suggestion,
indeed, could be enough to persuade an otherwise inditrerenr
Harris organizer to purchase his or her food from Lylc's, instead
of somewhere orrrcampus.

By integrating itself more closely with Harris, Lyle’s Pub
would raise its bottom Line and ideally depend less on school
subsidies to remain functional. After all, the pub has a great at
mosphere when it has customers, and it would be shameful to
have to eventually give up the room number “JRC 007" because
ofrunning deﬁcits. Obviously there still exist other impediments
to the pubs growth—the lack otdrart beer particularly comes to
mind—but these can be overcome in due time. We have some
easy solutions already at hand. Let’s try them out.
