Plans for Homecoming Released

 

Ames Game

Will Revive

Old Rivalry

Fini Out of Iowa State Tilt

With Injury Suffered
at Michigan

An old Missouri Valley conference

rivalry will be renewed for the ﬁrst

time in five years Saturday when
Grinnell and lawn State college will
mix on the Ames gridiron.

The two schools played a total of
31 games before the original Valley
conference disbanded and Iowa State
became a member of the Big Six in
1928. The next year, teams from the
two Iowa institutions played their last
game, a non-conference affair, which
the Cyclones from Ames won 27 to 7.

lowa state Holds Edge

In the total of 32 games, Iowa State
has by far the edge, having won 19
to Grinnell’s 10, three games being
tied. It is interesting to note that
prior to the year 1900, the Ames age
gregatiohs won but one out of seven
games, while since that year Grinnell
has come out on top in but four.

it was in 1928 that the Pioneers last
defeated their larger “rivals. A
drop kick provided the margin of vice
tory, Gi-innell winning 3 to ti.

Ames Tcam Favored

This year, the scarlet and black
gridders will be rated the underdogs.
Injuries and small squad will react
against the Watt coached eleven, but,
at the same time, Giinnell's showing
against Michigan State at East Lans~
ing Saturday, gives the smaller insti-
tution a ray of hope.

Wes Clark, halfback, seems to have
regained the accuracy which made him
a dangerous passer during his sopho-
more year, and capable pass receivers
have been found in Harold “Gander”
Anderson, end, and Jim Bradley, back,
who accounted for the three Pioneer
touchdowns against the Michigan State
Spartans, '

Bradley Scores

Contrary to press reports from East
Lansing, Bradley received the pass
which counted for Grinnell’s first
touchdown, the ball being batted by
Michigan State men in the end zone,
and snagged by the Pioneer back.

Themost disastrous result of last
Week’s game was the dislocated col-
lar bone which Vic Fini, fullback, re-
ceived, and which will keep him on
the side lines for at least three weeks,
Bob Morgan, tackle, who suffered a
iractured thumb, may be able to play
during part of Saturday’s contest, and
hob Sutton, who sprained his foot, is
improving rapidly.

Probable Lineup

It is probable that Watt will start
. lderson and Phelps at ends, Meeter
.nd Sutton at tackles, Safris and Hor-
on at guards, Fowler or Trumbull at
enter, Kingci-y, quarterback; Clark
nd Bauer, hallbacks. and Bradley,
ullback. The entire squad of 24 men
will make the trip.

Erlght spots of last week's game in
.ddition to Clark's passing, were
I ingery's defensive work at the tail—
-ack position, Meeter’s allvl‘ound work

Many Unexpected Talent!

Discovered as Students
Pursue SRE Work

It took the advent of Student Re—
lief Employment at Grinnell to bring
to the light the presence of astronom-
ers. snakecharmers, numismatists and
choir leadels in our midst; and these
are but a few odd occupations being
followed by the to relief workers on
the Grinnell campus.

Perhaps the most unique job is that
of Lcar Grimmer. Following a “train-
ing period,” so to speak, during which
he will clean up the museum in Blair
hall, Grimmer will abandon his as.
sociation with the dead to seek speci<
mens of the various and sundry snakes
native to this locale. A collection of
reptiles [or the zoology department is
his ultimate goal.

Robort Irwin and Roy Hamek will
dip into the treasures of the past in

 

smith.

What Do Student Relief Workers Do?

former is to seek out and catalogue
the art relics about the campus, while
irwin's duties include the classifica—
tion and evaluation of the collection
of ancient coins owned by the archs
eology department '

Construction of a telescope for the
astronomy department is the project
which has been alloted Abe Singer.

Annette Popma and Everett Curtis
are engaged in musical pursuits. Miss
Poma directs the choir of the United
Presbyterian church; Mr. Curtis per-
forms a similar service for the moth—

Many other distinctive puisuits are
included among those followed by the
students rcccivlng Student Relief Em—
ployment. Not all of the student aid
jobs are so glaincrous or exciting as
the few described above. It is the
fate of some of the workers to cor

fall the monotonoulo routinc of office
