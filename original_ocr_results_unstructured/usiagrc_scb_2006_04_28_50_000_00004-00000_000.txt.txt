The town of Grinnell hopes to become the site of an ambitious
project which will include in indoor minforest, desgined as equal
parts environmental statement, educational tool and tourist attiac-
tion IfGrinnell' is to beat out three othcr communities for the En-
vironmentul Project, it ﬁrst needs to come up with 325 million.

Local funds ale stietched after a number of recent development
projects, and town leaders are hoping that Grinnell College will sup
port their effort. President Russell K. Osgood is skeptical.

"We're aware of [the economic beneﬁts to the town], and that
interests us," Osgood said, “but our primary interest is what it would
do to help the program of the college."

Osgood said four criteria would determine the coilegc’s support:

- Ifit is consistent with the college's educational mission

- Financial feasibility

- The risks if it doesn't work out

' Other uses the college could find for the money

Osgood said that he is still trying to learn more about the project,
but remains doubtful. “it’s an incredibly expensive project,"Osgood
said. “It's visionary and interesting. I think the [ﬁnancial] risks are
quite high. I don’t have a strong sense of the positive beneﬁts that
would flow to the college."

Dav-id Campbell, Biology, has been working in the Amazon
rainforest since the early 19705 and served on the Project’s board
several years ago. “Like all captive exhibits, this is just a facsimile
of the real thing," Campbell said. “I think its real potential is as a
teaching tool."

Jonathan Andelson, Anthropology, is the chair of Grinnell's
Prairie Studies Program, and submitted ai report to Osgood about
potential beneﬁts for the college from the Project. They included
small research projects, supplements for textbook study of ecosysr

terns, student internships andjobs at the Project.

The Project is projected to be a major attraction for elementary
school field trips. Education students at Grinnell could work with
the Pioject’s emplyoees to develop teaching methods. David Oman,
the executive director of the Project, said that one goal of the Project
would be “the professional development of tcachcrs,"

The Environmental Project isn't entirely rcvoiunonary. The
Eden Ploject opened in the U.l<. in 2001, and is a similarly cons
ceivcci complex. Many involved in the project from one side or an—
other have pointed to the Eden Project as a successful example.

“A couple of our trustees have been to the Eden Project, and
they were .d.ubious about it [going in], said Osgood. “They went
to it and thought it was absolutely fantastic."

When Campbell sewed on the Environmental Projects board,
he took a special trip to see Eden 1 came back dazzled," Campbell
said. “It's ﬁnancially successful. It's become a centerpiece for envir
ronmentalism,"

Mike Blouin, a Democratic candidate for governor and former
director of Economic Development under Governor Vilsnck, had a
similar experience.

“I didn’t think much of the [Environmental] Project until I
visited the Eden Project,"Blouin said. “It made a believer out of me
that this could work," though Blouin expressed reservations about
how much of the project should be funded by the government.

Dean of Admission Jim Sumner said that he didn’t expect a mat
jor impact on applications if the project was located in Grinnell,
“Any time that we can point to any academic advantage a student
has here, that's what we talk about," Sumner suid."1t would be one
of several things that would drive the application pool up. I wouldn't
see it as one of those things that would drive the applications up five
or 10 percent."

the inteinational locations they iecruit in, but they
have made the new policy clear when they go.

On their applications, international applicants are
asked how much they can contribute to their educar
tion and their ﬁnancial situation is taken into account.
Although ability to pay is important, other qualifica-
tions still weigh heavily in international admittance. if
a wealthier student has comparable qualifications to a
poorer student, the wealthier student will be admitted
first. Howevei, international students will not be ac-
cepted if they are ﬁnancially able to come, but not as
well qualified. “We don't bend very far," said Sumner.
“Our policy now is to admit fewer and fund them bets
tei, and then more of them Will be able to say yes."

Prospective students must make their decisions
based on a combination of academic, ﬁnancial and en-
vironmentai reasons. "We want prospective students
to take a hard, critical, close look,” said Sumner.

Prospective students sample various slices of cam—
pus life to try to get the feel of the place. “I visited
physics today," said Martina King, a prospie from
Boulder, Colorado. "It was cool. I understood what
they were talking about." King is trying to choose
between Grinnell and St. Olaf. “Right now, it has to
be about the feeling of the place," she said. “They're
similar academically"

Andrew Myers, a prospective student from McKr
eesport, PA, was enthusiastic about Grinnell’s social
atmosphere. “This morning I played basketball with
members of the football team," he said. “Out of net
where, they just let me sub in.That was really cool."

Myers had some trouble adjusting to the land—
scape. “You have to get used to it being ﬂat here. It
is really tlat."
