SUNDAY TENNIS FOR WOMEN.

One of the parts of an unwritten code in Grinnell _

which has been given the, force oi law by long tradition
is the custom of regarding the use or the women's ten»
nis courts on Sunday as taboo. The women's leagm‘e
board has passed no nilc relating to the use oi the ten-
nis courts, yet cvet-y girl in the quadrangle knows that
she must not use them on Sunday. She may regard the
prohibition as ridiculous, but she obeys it.

This restriction on the use oi college equipment not

only has never been oiricially declared a rule, but it also
has never had the support at public opinion. A campus
opinion column printed last semester on the question.
“Do you think it is fair that only men can play tennis
in Grinnell on Sunday?" contains negative answers irom
all the men and women picked at random to reply to
the inquiry. .

There is no restriction on the use or the men's
courts at any time. Surely the right to play tennis on
Sunday has no relation to sex, Either the taking of
cxcrcise on Sunday should be declared against the policy
oi the college, or all students should be given equal
rights in the matter. _

As a measure oi Sunday observance, reireining, be-
cause or compulsion or any kind, from playing tennis, is
futile. students who have arrived at college age are
capable oi making their own decisions on such points
as this. And out-oi-door exercise is certainly a whole
some way oi passing what too many students regard as
a dreary dny. ,

Since neither the league bonrrl nor the faculty has
given a ruling on the question of Sunday sports, noth-
ing but fear oi being the ﬁrst to break a tradition pre-
vents the numerous girls, who have expressed Lllemr
selves as being in iavor oi Sunday tennis, irom playing.
The‘ thing to do ior those who desire to play is to play

REACH FOR A SACK!

The bread-line in the rec room Sunday noon aiter
dinner was only the outward Sign oi a recent change in
die Women’s dining rules. It marked the advent oi a
new custom in Grinnell, one which has met the approb-
aLion oi the girls and the envy oi some oi the boys.
The practice oi not having Sunday night lunches served
in the quadrangle, but oi having each girl get her lunch
in a paper sack aiter dinner. is a good one for several
reasons, and has generally gained the approval oi the

women.
In the first place few people ever went down to

Sunday lunches anyway, and yet practically the entire
staii of waiters and waitresses and the kitchen iorce
had to he on hand and were iorced to put in their, time
when there really wasn't enough work to make it pay.
Under the new system they now have this one night

oii during the week.

The quadrangle as a whole wasn't sotisiied with the
lunches and ate out, although in reality they had to pay
for two meals that way. Now they can get iood suit-
able tor a picnic eiter dinner, and one extra dish will be
served at the noon meal, making up tor the lack oi the
regular lunch. In this way the dinner is improved and
everyone can get, something for the price oi the even-
ing meal. _

Ii LhiS plan works out as successfully as it has
started, pct-hops -tlle genernl board‘bill could be reduced
in price next year_ by cutting out the Sunday night
lunches altogether. In many schools this is done be-
cause so many students pretcr not to eat anything or
to take their meals out. .

The men have practically the same situation in the
dorms that the women had, end so it is altogether pos-
sible that some such plan can be worked out there to

the satisicction of the help and the students as a whole.
