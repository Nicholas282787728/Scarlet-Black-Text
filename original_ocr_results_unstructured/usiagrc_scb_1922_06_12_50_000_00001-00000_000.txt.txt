lPresident Gives Advice to Future
Seniors in Annual Junior
Chapel.

"The King is dead, Long live The
~King," quoted FrcSident Main in chap-
cl Tuesday morning in addressing the
Juniors. The Seniors lJELVE gone out
from our midst but the Juniors must
take their place and take up the duties
and responsibilities of the departed, he
went on to say.

The president declared Lhztt every
step forward meant an added respon-
‘Sibility and :1 new life fur those Who
take the Step. If we succeed here we
are l1kely to succeed in' the world be-
yond, out if we loaf here we arc likely
lto rail in ihc future. “What we do
here '5 reflected in our later life." he
said. Grades don’t necessarialy
lconnt; it is the work that a. person
iputs in that brings him return. The
good and poor students are on the
same level if nicy both do their Work
the past they can and war-l: all that
they can. \Vhal‘. is wanted is energy,
devotio‘n, and purpose, and no school
should accept a student unless he has
these things in mind when he applies
for admission. “No admission except
on business," is the sign on the em
trance to Grinuell and it is placed
Lhere to keep the loafer out.

”All We Want is a Selection uf stud-
ents who will vindicate the purposes
of a Christian college," declared the
speaker in defending the action 0[ the
facility on the new rules of admission
and elegibllity.

“These days are- good, hut better
