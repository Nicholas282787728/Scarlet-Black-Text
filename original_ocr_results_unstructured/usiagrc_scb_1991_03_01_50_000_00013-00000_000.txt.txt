And with the housingproblem we're

campus study is a really important
facet of the Gnnncll education I
hear nothing but rave reviews from
people who go off campus; they
really enjoy it. It‘s a nicc change.
And I look forward to opening the
door to more studentsto that type of
thing.

Whathave you contributed in
the campus, and how do you feel

' you have represented student

interests in that contribulion?

I can’t cite one contribution I
have made to the campus. There’s
nothing huge, big, that I can say
like, Joe McCarthy did this, Joe
McCarthy did that. All I can say is

that I believe I'm a present force in
