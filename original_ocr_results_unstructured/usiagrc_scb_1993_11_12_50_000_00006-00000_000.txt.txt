Black Community
Must Be Conscious of
Patriarchy and Sexism

A Personal Opinion By Tara Nelson

 

 

dialogue concerning the perpetration of patriarchy and

sexism in the black community. Although I make spe-
cific references to the effects of sexism on the black community,
it is clear to me that sexism is not exclusive to the black
community.

I remember crying while on the phone and my father saying,
“So what are you gonna do about it?" ltwas at that moment that
I made a conscious decision to speak and not be a victim. My
father‘s words forced me to recognize and acknowledge that as
a black woman my choice is no choice. Thus, this is an essay in
response to black male violence against black women.

I had called my father because, once again I had heard about
a black man’s violence against a black woman. The tears I cried
while on the phone with my father were tears of both rage and
pain. I was hurt because I realized that a largely accepted
American ritual is silencing, maiming, and murdering women.
For the first time in my life I fellas lfthere was no safe place for
me to exist as a black woman.

I was threatened. l was outraged because I felt alone,
unprotected, and powerless. As a young woman, growing up, I
had always been sheltered and protected by either my father or
brother. It was hard to accept that neither my father or brother
could possibly support me now. As a strong black woman I stood
alone because of my pro-black and pro-woman politics; I recog-
nized and accepted my responsibility to assert that it is unaccept-
able for black men to verbally or physically abuse women,
especially black women.

The rage and pain I felt because some black men commit
violence against black women caused me to write. There are two
goals I hope to accomplish by speaking against black male
violence. First. I demand that black men acknowledge their
privilege as men ‘ his society. Second, I demand that black
men take responsi ility for their actions and be willing to accept
the consequences oftheir Violence without bitterness and resent-
ment against black women who make decisions to fight and
resist this ritual of Violence.

As a black woman I assert that it is unacceptable for a black
man to label me a bitch, whore, or hoochie privately or publicly.
When black men denigrate black women, their behavior is equiva-
lent to whites who label blacks as ”nigger.” If black men are
against black women, with whom will black women align them-
selves? How will the hatred between black women and black
men transform the agenda and achievements of blacks in a white
supremacist world? When will black men wake from their
debilitating state of masculinity? I have decided to speak and
resist because as a concerned black woman, I cannot watch idly
while the black community further divides along gender lines.
The moment has come for black people, both male and female,
to unite with mutual love and respect.

THIS essay is intended to raise consciousness and invite

 

IN response to last week’s review of
The Joy Luck Club-

It is so unusual that a movie re-
view would get me so infuriated that I
feel a responsibility to respond-but
after reading the two rcvtews of The
Joy Luck Club, I was INCENSED. It
is not about a conﬂictof Opinion here;
it is about the reviewers being cultur-
ally offensive and clueless. If they
knew anything about Chinese culture,
they would not have been so quick to
comment about this “bad” movie. I
thought was by far the best movie I
have seen in a while. I was incredibly
proud to see for the first time such
strong and beautiful Asian American
women on the big screen in a major
motion pricturc.

RivaSharplcscomments that“thc
interaction of the daughters and their
mothers is awkward and seems unr
natural tothe American viewer,” Does
this makeit“bad"’l Ifanything, I hope
that it would help to educate others; I
hope that one could apprct'tzie itand be
grateful for learning something new
about another culture rather than put it
downastoo‘awkward.” Damnstmight
the relationships are differentl it's
special because much of their emo-
tions and feelings are unspoken, but
they still come across as powerful be
cause of the action they take. So much
of the communicative process in Chiv
nese culture, at least from whatl have
experienced, lies not in the explicit but
what is not spoken.

Bill Mabon thought the “subject
matter does not make a goodfllm" and
the “poor acting and unlively direction
make it...a(n) exercise in trying to read
your watchin thedark." Pooracting?!
I cried in every scene because the
acting was so convincing and power-
ful. I even cried after the movie. I
think Billjust does not understand the
deep substance behind the plot. lie to

therefore. to me, offending a pan of
my strong culture in which I am very
proud. But what is really ludicrous is
his comment that the movie lacks “in-
teresting and real characters." Get a
clue!!! I-Iowwouldheknowiftheyare
real ornot? Whatan ignorant white or
“haole” (as we say in Hawaii) thing to
say! Ifanything. these women, espe-
cially the first generation mothers, are
the strongest characters I have seen on
screen in a long time, We both saw the

major Lraumasthey all had to deal with
when in China and America, and he
thinks they are not strong?! If that’s
notstrong,Idon’tknowwhatis-inany
culture for that matter. Is it because
they tlirl not have white middle class
jObS and white feminist viewpoints to
make tliem“strong"?l Please. Hislast
comment was about the hollow dopicr
tion ofpcople which diminisltes their
humanness. He lost the here. This

movie touched the very core of hu-
inanity.
