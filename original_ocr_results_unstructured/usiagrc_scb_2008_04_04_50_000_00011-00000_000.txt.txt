Frisbee teams place top three in GA

BY CLAIRE REEDER &JOHNNY Bust:

After a 20- -plus-hour drive, the Grinnell Ultimate FrisV
bee teams pulled up to an ornate, grand house in historic Sat
vannah. The horrse where they were to stay dated back to 1870,
with weeping willow branches blowing in the breeze and red
and blue ﬂowers blossoming in the window boxes, and they
arrived only to discover the power was out.
But it was business as usual for the Grins
nellephants and Sticky Tongue Frogs, the
ﬂexible teams always ready forladventure,
who trekked to Savannah, GA for the High
Tide tournament the first week of spring
break.

Both teams had winning records against
several teams that they usually do not com,
pete against, with the men's team posting
a third place ﬁnish with a 6—2 record and
the women's team placing second after loss
ing in the championship round to the Amherst Women's team,
sparkle Motion, in a close 11r9 loss, making their record 671.

The southeastern setting was full of new teams Grinnell
does not typically face in Midwestern tournaments. As the
teams prepare for sectionals, it was beneﬁcial to go up agarrrst
new faces of competition.

“There are a lot of powerhouse tournaments that are held

ovct spring break said Nathan Levin 10. But in Georgia we
faced teams that were more at our level."

The break was packed with many Frisbee games, both coma
peritive and fully recreational. Both teams enjoyed the change
from poor Iowa weather to the climate Georgia provided. “Af—
ter practicing in tltc cold rain, itwas nice to get to play in Geor-
gia," said Brigitte Anthony '08, “And we were
right by the beachi"

The trip was not all sand, suit and {rise
bee, though. In addition to the surprrse power
outage, other issues arose with the house
ing situation. Because of waiting too long
to book a house, the usual choices of meat
rion homes were fully taken. The 30-per—
son team ended up in Savannah's historic
district in a house with a maximum capac—
ity of 16 tenants. There was also a change of
pace in the traditional frisbcc team antics.

“It was a Christian tournament,"said Anthony, “so it was re-
ally different from most of our tournaments, since it's usually a

Back in Grinncll,both teams continue to practice during the
afternoon on Mac FieldThe frisbcc teams will next play in the
sectional tournament on Apr. 11,12 in Arncs wrth hopes of
advancing to the regional level competitions

Club volleyball in action

Newly formed men’s team competes,

or MATT ZMUDKA

on Mar. 1-2, the premier men's volleyball clubs of the
Midwest met {or a tournament in iowa City Up there with
powerhouses iowa and Nebraska were a dozen ragtag Grmnell
students, half with no volleyball experience prior to this year.

Understandably, the team got beat up in the standings;
but for this new group of volleyballers, their spirits were only
heightened. “We got last place, but we were all happy with the
weekend," player Aaron Swaney'll said.

It was a lucky accident that spiked the men’s club volleyball
team into existence earlier this year. According to Jeff Kljaich
’11, one of the team founders, “I ran into james Archer (’10) in
the weight room during N80 and he had a volleyball shirt on.”
The two talked about starting a men’s team, which Archer had
attempted last year but was unable to grow involvment.

The idea lay dormant until they ended up on the same team
for intramural volleyball; “We talked about it and talked about

t .. alot ofthe kids on my team are on the team,"l£ljaich said.
After intramural season, the dozen or so men began practices
two to three times weekly, preparing for their first tournament
earlier last month. 4

An informal atmosphere keeps the team together, “We

hopes to gain members, momentum

dont really have anybody in charge," Swaney said The team is
almost entirely composed of the ﬁrst and second- -plac= teams
from int mural league Many of the players also play soccer,
which limits the season to after the fall, although Kljaich said,
“You can have tournaments every weekend from September to
Ma ."

yThough they finished poorly at the Iowa City tournament,
the team remains optimistic. “We lost all of our matches hut
won some of our games, which is berter than we thought we
would do,"Swaney saidsThe team also hopes to host a tourna-
ment in Grinnell at the end oprril.

swaaey and Kljaich agreed that having enough players has
been their biggest struggle this year. “The girls (volleyball play-
ers) come to our practices to fill out the teams, twelve to four-
teen people,"1<liaich said. “We've developed a bond as team-
mates, but we’d also like to see new faces. It's open to the public
basically."

Kljalch's lofty dream for the team is to develop a notoriety
similar to Grinnell basketball. “Ifwe ever have a defrnite season
where we play onesonsone with teams on Thursday night, my

, dream is just to see the crowd roaring, like at basketball games.

That’s where we’re trying to go with tliis,"he said.
