Grinnell’s website is out of
date and ugly, but change
might be a long time coming

By DAVID H. MONTGOMERY

As Grinnell's online media and web coordi-
nator Leonya Ivanov tells it, when the current
version of the Grinnell.edu website first went
online, it was two years ahead of its time.

Five years later, the fast-changing internet
has left Grinnell’s website in the dust. Ad-
ministrators, SGA and 91 percent of students
voting on a recent student 'm' 'ative agree that
our website needs serious revisionito its unt
derlying structure even more than to its often
unappealing cosmetic appearance. Despite this
consensus, two separate efforts are ongoing to
revise the web Sitthonc run by the adminis-
tration, another by SGA. As of now, the two
efforts exist simultaneously with little eoops
cration or coordination.

Ivanov. who designed the software behind
Grinnell’s website called “Born Free," is begins
ning to completely revamp the website.

As lvanov and his team slowly nimp up
their effort, an SGA resolution last week
called for a sttrdent committee to look into
revising the website. The student Technology
Advisory Committee (STAC) is organizing
the new ad lioc committec,which is little more
than an idea at this point.

One factor motivating SGA’s involvement
is a desire to have students design as much of
the new website ns possible. “Ideally, I would
love to see heavy student involvement in the
redesign process," said SGA Vice President
for Student Affairs Jan Koszewski ’08. “I think
it’s really exciting that students have stepped
up and said, ‘This is something we want to be
changed.”

IVlatk Root-Wilcy'ﬂ‘), who submitted inn
depent proposals for a new web site to the ads
ministration, said that the formal inﬂuence of
SGA could lead to more student inﬂuence,

“1 think the fact that I did it on my own
caught [the administration] by surprise,”
Root-Wiley said. “I think that a website for
the college needs to anticipate too many user
needs for one student to meet tltem all."

While SGA’s new website committee has
yet to actually form, Ivanov is a little further
along. The first step in a complete overhaul of
the website is to replace Born Free With a new
“content management system”—a program
that allows designers to update the web site
without knowing code. lvanov hopes to settle
on a system by the end ofthc calendarycar.

After a new system is chosen, Ivanov will
begin work on redesigning the website's are
chitecmte ind appearance. Oftl‘le two, Ivanov
places a much greater priority on the under
the—hood parts ofweb design.

“Whatever we decide to do, we can’t just
decide, ‘olmy, this is going to go here because
it looks pretty,“ Ivanov said. “Unfortunately,
that's the list question."

Curtcndy, Ivanov has no deadline, but
wants to have something to show by this sums
met. “If nothing happens by summer, then
judge,” he said. “Things can go eernplerely
wrong."

Building blocks
for good sites

it Dominantphoto: A visually appealing anchor
2. Student links: Serves repeat users of site by placing student

links prominently.

3. Search bar: Must be prominently located. Clever versions
search either the site or the directory.

4. Sparse links: No more than eight items in a horizontal menu
to make those items easier to find.
5. Role-based navigation: Helps users identify themselves quickly,

but can be difficult to keep updated.
6. Content: Should provide useful information for all types of users,
including current students, prospective students and alumni.
