We are )lrogressive; we are
dashiugly independent. We
have the {our-three course,
Or, as some preior to call it,
the three-four course. (There
is, you see, some diuerence of
opinion here; no one is cer-
tain just what the title of the
program is.)

No one. in tact. is certain just
what the program entails. But
this matters very little, What
matters is that we now have
three (or two) class meetings
a week, and write one (or
more) paper more (or less) in-
dependently than those we used
to write . . for four hours
credit. In some tour-three cours-
es, naturally, the fourthshour
project is integrated, while in
others it is not; that is, in some
courses you write the paper as
a part oi four hours’ credit (a
hangover from basic communi-
cations, i suspect), and in oth»
ers (the lsintegrated ones) you
write the paper for the fourth
hour of credit itself.

To regard this as absurd is
heresy—analagous to laughing
at the emperor’s new clothes.

Still, no one is quite ready
to state that the new curriculum
has no bugs in it, and for this
reason there was hrought tor

The meeting was a smash- l

scope of the (ourrthree tor

were aired some interesting
views. One student suggested
that the proicssor consult with
his pupils as to the content
or his courses: another thought
exams had best he done away
with. And one nrotossor, hag-
gard, I gather, with over-
work. expressed a tear that
