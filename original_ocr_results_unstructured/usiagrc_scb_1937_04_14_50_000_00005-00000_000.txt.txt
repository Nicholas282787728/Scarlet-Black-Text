Professor Experiments
to Develop Stingless
Variety of Bees

Alfred, N. Y7(ACP)—-By
shooting radium—rays through
queen bees, Dr. Lloyd R. Watson,
of Alfred university, hopes to pro
duce a stingless variety.

If this summer's experiments
should lead to the secret of a new
kind of bee, a kind that will have
only harmless stingers or lack
them entirely, the United states
can become a country of stingless
bees by 1940, he said.

In the trial and error experi-
ments. Dr. Watson will expose fer.
tile queen bees to radium in hopes
that their offspring may develop
stinger peculiarities,

"We see no reason why it can't
be done,” said the Alfred protes
sor. “We may have to try as
many as 10,00 times but by irra-
diating every fertile bee that
comes through our laboratory.
we hope sooner or later to stumble
across stingless offspring."

COLLEGIATE REVIEW.

An anonymous contribution
from Adrian college: “Going
around with women keeps me
young, I started going with them
four years ago when I was a
freshman—and I'm still a fresh»
man."

When lessons, meetings, plays
and outside activities pile up on
the calendars of the girls at
Stephens college. the president
calls a “Stop day," 24 hours dur-
ing which students can do what
they please.

When Jason Bernie, son of the
"Old Maestro," left Rutgers Uni-
versity to take a position at the
Universal studios in Hollywood,
he brought to an end a friendly
ieud with W. Winchell, a student
who is no relative of the famous
columnist. The two, because of
their names, had carried on a
friendly bantering.

Chemist Believes
Higher Purchasing Power
Would Increase Life Span

New York, N. Y (ACP)7I1
the large numbers of people had
higher purchasing power, they
could increase their life span by
at least seven years.

That is what Lu, dehry c. Sher-
man, Mitchell professor of chemis-
try at Columbia university, told
the Academy of Medicine.

They would be able to take full
advantage of new knowledge ;
the field of nutrition, he saidi
advantage that could aid them in
w rding oft discasc as well as see
n ty.

“Undoubtedly the great major
ity of all people will he benefited,
the general level of the public
health will be raised, and the av~
erages of our vital statistics im»
proved at many points by the sim
ple taking of a larger proportion
of the needed nutritional calories
in the form of the protective
foods.

“Naturally, we also hope that a
larger proportion 0[ people will
soon have ampler purchasing powe
cr We realize that right rela-
tions between purchasing power
and the general level of prices is
essential to the ability of any
community to get the full benefit
of any new knowledge of nutri-
tionxghe explained.

“For it is now clear to anyone
who will study the evidence that
nutrition has greater constructive
potentiality than science has fore-
seen, and that even in the every»
day ch c of food we are dealing
with values which are above price
for the health and efficiency, dur-
ation and dignity of human life."

A new “entranceeeitit” course in
matrimony has been added to the
Utah state Agriculture college
curriculum. “Marriage and di-
verse" is the name of the study.

The chain letter disease has
broken out again in the form of
a necktie exchange at Oberlin col»
lege. Campus rumor has it that
the girls are thinking of starting
a silk stocking chain. With a run
of luck, some hose-hoper-for will
get 27 pairs.

Have you ever hccn in the base
ment of the Women's gym or in
the old art room of the Alumni
Recitation hall" Although they
are draped with cohwehs andl
innsty from disuse, there are many
unfamiliar places on thc campus
which contain a motley but inter-
esting assortment of articles.

In the junk-strewn basement of
the Women's gym is a regulation
bowling- alley, bllt it is covered
with barrels, rocking chairs, and
old lumber.

Dirt Floor

The Y basement. with its dirt
floor, was filled with a few weak
plants and rows of dirty bottles full
of ,pale, dead matter, cootlnow
basement was piled with auditori-
uni seats, excelsior, and an lip-
rooted drinking fountain,

Elmer apologized for the insigr
nificant basement of the Alumni
Recitation ball. “A disgrace to
this lovely building,” he called it.
But we weren’t disappointed. In
the corner of the rubbish room was
a two toot wire cylinder contrap-
tion invented by Dr. Conard for
dusting erascrs. “I'd rather hang
them out the windows," Elmer
said.

Dusty Portraits

The biggest surprise came when
Elmer led us past steam boilers,
pipes, ventilating shafts, and fans
to the art room, There, row upon
row, were piled dusty portraits in
gilded frames. In the corner stood
a magnificent statue of some R0-
man senator, his toe crushed and
his neck broken. The statue of
Discobalus was cracked in the mills
die, President Main's plaster—of-
Paris bust had an elegant slick»
pin in the tie.

tower, the roofs, and the hundreds
