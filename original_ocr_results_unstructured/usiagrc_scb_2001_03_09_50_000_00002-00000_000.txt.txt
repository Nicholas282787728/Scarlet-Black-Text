(tips for computer users}
have you ever wanted to
make a difference in your
life? Have you never found
the right cause? Well, we
have a rob for you!

US has submitted a
proposal to require all
students to purchase a
Laptop computer upon
enrolling in Grinnell
College, The cost will he
ﬁgured into the tuition,
and students will be able to
keep the computers when
they leave, As a result,
professors will be able to
teach with computerraided
devices, and general
computer Labs will become
essentially obsolete.

Do you like this idea?

5m, which represents
the student opinion on
campus, is in the process of
writing a ioirnal proposal to
let ITS, at. al, know what
the students think.

We need your input or
we‘re just going to come up
with the opinion ourselves.

Things you can do:

1) Fill out the survey
you received in your
mailbox. 5m doesn’t get
to see those, but at least
you'll he voicing an
opinion.

2) Email
saet@gnnnell,edu with
your comments about the
proposal to require laptops.

Grinneil to stick with SATs

Grinncll will most likely rcraru irs
admissions requirement of The College
Board's Scholastic Aprlludc Test or
American CollcgoTosring's ACT. accord
ing to Jim Sumner, dean of admissions.

Thc fairncss and utility tifstandardr
izcd resting have been debated recently
in rhc wake ora speech by the presidenr
of the University of California which
urged th: system to discard thcir SAT
requirement.

“I’ve sort of been through this once
before." said Sumner. The mid-1970s, he
recalled. had seen a similar trend away
from such rating. At the time, he had
worked for The admissions dcparrment
at Willamcttc University in California.

“Wc did a littlc markcl research that
round that people considered us a little
less sclcctivct" he said, “ but we couldn't
really go to rho faculty rvith that inforr
mation," Therefore, the department eats
umincd correlation between college
records, high school records, and SAT
scores. Though neither admissions rte
ouircmem proved a better predictor,
when combined, SAT and high school
records predicted collcgc performance
with grcar accuracy

“I'm not a huge fan ofthc SAT or the
ACT," admitted Sumner. “People of
color, as a group, don't score as well. on
the other hand. as long as you’re aware or
that and allow for it. I don't so: that ill a
placc like this that's much of; problem."

In States such as California, which
have recently outlawedaihrmative acrron
procedures, such correcring for demo
graphics rvould be illegal. Sumner said
he helrtvedrhat the UC proposal, as well
as others In Propositionaoa states, are
motivated by desires to maintain diverse
student bodies in the race orpiobilsrrory
laws
