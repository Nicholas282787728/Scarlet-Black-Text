Dickerson’s
Songs Lose
Effectiveness

Arrangement of Selections
Hampers Soloist
Says Chitic

By H. w. MATIACK
(Professor of Organ)

Hugh Dickerson’s song recital in
Herrick chapel last evening brought
again to hearing a number of the best
examples of songwriting, and several
less familiar compositions of great
beauty. The artist handicapped him»
self, however, in a rather unfortunate
arrangement of his selections, and
had to work halfway through the
evening before he really won his au-

' dience.

He followed the conventional song-
program, beginning with arias from
Italian operas (the songs by Handel
fall in this category in spite of their
English text) but his first number. by
the early 18th century Bononcini, had
little interest except its archaic style,
so that Mr. Dickerson failed in the
first requirement of a concert artist,
namely, to make an imposing en-
trance.

Voicc Rich

His Handel songs were beautifully'

given, and in them, as in other parts
of the program, his exceptional clear-

ness of articulation, and the richness‘

of the lower registers of his voice,
contributed tn’the enjoyment of the
evening. His upper notes are not so
successful, and at times seemed in
danger of disappearing altogether.

The German and French gropps
contained several charming songs,
but their effect was greatly diminishe
ed because of the mystery which Sur—
rounded their meaning. Mr. Dicker—
son should realize that a study of the
modern languages is no longer re-
quired in college. and that even a Phi
Beta Kappa may graduate without
having the least idea what such come
mon terms as ”Maigre moi," and “Der
Doppelganger" signify.

Should Condescend

Since most of these songs have for
their subject a rather definite emOr
tional reaction it is only just that
listeners should have some inkling of
their content. With some reconstruc-
tion of his program, and just a little
condescension to even a. college audi—
ence’s linguistic limitations, Mr.
Dickerson's success would have been
tremendous, for be has a rich voice
and a highly musical sense of what
he is doing.

Miss MacDonald, professor of piano-
forte, played Mr. Dickerson-s accom-
paniments with ease and effective-
ness, and contributed a large share to
the program, It would be a pleasure
to hear these two artists again, for
Mr. Dickerson is clearly a singer of
great intelligence.

By FRANK PURBUSH

The January issue of ”College
Verse,” publication of the College
Poetry Society of America, is a pot-
.pourri of collegiate infantilism and
promising verse. Comminglcd with
odes to Death (invariably capitalized)
are sonnets showing a fulfilled prom-
ise. On companion pages are echoes
of the Rubyiat and a Negro poem
which would cause Paul Green to
shudder.

“Time is a Dream" by Miss Lillian
v. Inke is first in position. ambitious
in its scope, inadequate in its expres-
sion. It is a prime example of what
Max Eastman speaks of as "poets
talking to themselves." Described as
a symphonic sequence, it attempts to
direct the tempo of reading by such
musical terms as “crescendo," “Stac-
-cato," and "ritardando."

No Exception
The verse is heightened by the use

It's up to Grinnell, playing on its
home floor, to pull the upset of the
season tonight and keep the cur—
rent Missouri valley conference has-
ketball race from becoming a one
team affair with Creightou’s quintet
as that team.

Both the Pioneers and Bluejays
have trampled over Washington and
the Oklahoma Aggies and have yet
to meet defeat in the Valley, How-
ever, Coach A. A. Schahinger's boys
have been the most impressive and
are consequently favored to win from
the scarlet and black.

Tuesday the Nebraskans had an
enjoyable evening in swamping the
Cowboys from Oklahoma, 65 to 23,
Grinnell defeated the Aggies in an

of onomatapoeia and syllabication, but
even these five and six syllable words
fail to give it completeness. It is
ambitious but confusing. NO poet has
been entirely successful in this form
iMiss Inke is no exception.

D. Wandrei's sonnets are by far the
most mature verse in the issue. Even
he has an inadequate grasp of words.
though his expressions are fresh. The
pleasure found in Mr, Mindrd’s first
two poems are dispelled by an out-
rageous attempt at Negro folk verse.
Miss Dworsky, Miss Morton, and
Miss Rott reveal emotions, notable in
their refinement.

Obsessed With Death

The poem, "Sufficiency,” by Ro-
berta Mansbarger remains. The high
quality of its execution makes it re»
grettable that this young poet should
be so obsessed with Death (I shall
capitalize it in deference). She wrote
equally good verse in the November
issue, but on the same subject.

“Sufficiency" has the solidity of
unity about Its thought and re-
strainment in presentation object to
analysis. It is read not once, but
twice, and some will even reflect a
bit before moving across the page.
If in five years Miss Mansbarger has
changed her subject, she cannot have
lost the quiet power she now pos»
585583.

The final two pages of ”College
Verse" contain comments from meme
her—colleges on the first issue, an in-
troduction to associate editors, and a
naive letter from the Missouri chap»
Ler strikingly reminiscent of the
“Write To Me” column of cheap mag:
azines.

Geneva P‘arley
Features Talks
, on Armaments,

of Beale’s Lecture
Wednesday

“Arbitration. security, and disarm-
ament are a trio of words much heard
at Geneva," said Howard Beale.
former Grinnell college instructor, in
his lecture before the joint meeting
of the Young Men’s and Young Worn»
en’s Christian associations Wednes-
day evening.

To bring these situations about he
thinks there must be international
cooperation on «the abolition of tar»
iffs, reparations. and war debts; iia.
tional and international planning to
prevent crisis; recognition of Russia,
avoidance of imperialism and the
entrance of the United States into
the World court.

Wars Futile

Mr, Beale pointed out the futility
of wars in that they result in econ-
omic difficulties, deprive nations of
leaders, and leave problems that are
often causes of other wars. He con~
siders that another war will wipe out
our whole economic structure.

Regarding the Geneva conference
in February, Mr. Beale outlined the
attitudes of countries toward dis-
armament. France will be unwilling
to disarm without security. In Eng»

armament. Irbsly will object to no
limitations downward, while Russia
and Germany will demand the most
drastic forms of disarmament. Europe
is eager for the abolition of battle-
ships and the adoption of the budge-.

tary limitation to defeat the present,
race for quality since quantity is now
limited.

Need Public Opinion

Mr. Beale thinks the average
American citizen can promote the
success of the disarmament confer
ence by informing himself on the
subject and thus swelling the press—
ure of public opinion. Much will de—
pend on the attitude of the delegates
from the United States.

In concluding his talk the lecturer
quoted Henry L. Stimson. secretary
of state, as saying, "The alternative
of disarmament is too impossible for
soher men and women to face.”

Paul Beall to ‘Tt‘i’ke Charge

Paul Beall was placed in charge of
plans for a skating rink on the local
golf course pond by the council of
house chairmen here Thursday night.
The council investigated possibilities
for a skating rink here in the fall
and decided that the pond at the
local country club would be the only
feasable location.

The next meeting of the council

record in the Kansas College confer

Kons, he coached both basketball
and football. In 1913 his basketball
team won the Kansas conference
title and the Patriotic Basketball
tournament art Kansas City.

The Creighton mentor is president
of the Missouri Valley conference
and of the National Association of
Basketball Coaches, the highest
honor attainable in the profession.

After he took charge at Creighton,
the Jays won the basketball champ-

 

ionship of the North Central confer-,
ence five out of Six years. He was
largely responsihlc for Crcighton's
joining the Missouri Valley confer-

Cafeteria Plan
Starts Monday

Both Dining Rooms Open
From 7:15 Until 8:15

Cafeteria service for breakfast will
be inaugurated in both the dormitory
and quadrangle dining rooms Monday,
Miss Anne Smith. house director, an
nounced today. The dining rooms
will be open from 7-15 to 8:15.a. in.

Two services of breakfast had at'
first been considered by the authori-

’ties, one at 7: 15 and the other at 8,

with regular table seivice, but follow-
ing a meeting of the house and cote
tage chairmen with Miss Smith this
morning it was decided to give the
cafeteria method a trial for an un-
determined length of time.

There will be serving tables in the
dining rooms with waiters in attend-
ance, and students will get their food
there, carrying it to the regular
tables. Although the previous plan
of two regular services did not meet
with approval, Miss Smith thought
that the cafeteria service would re-
quire as many if not more than the
regular staff of waiters.

After the first few days of the new
plan the opening of the breakfast
period may be changed from 7:15 to

. 0, if it is found that students can
be handled in the shorter period, Miss
Smith said.
