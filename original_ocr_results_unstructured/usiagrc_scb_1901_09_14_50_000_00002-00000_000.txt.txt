ment of the Business Manager
with regard to subscriptionstorthe
SCARLET AND BLACK, we wish most
heartily to make it. The publica
tion of this paper is not a pllllarh
thropic work, but a matter of busi»

such it is highly desirable that its

as consistent a manner as is pos

“ OOD bye, all; good bye.

It's God’s Way; His will
be done." such were the last
conscious words of PreSldent Mcr
Kinley, who died at 2:15 this
morning, and in these words is
found the spirit of an unusually
pure and unselﬁsh life. President
Main told the men last night that
the spirit ot a lite marks the dire
ference between good and bad;
between success and failure. No
better illustration of this can be
found in modern times than the
lite of our late President. His
undying devotion to an invalid
wite, his never tailing ﬁdelity to
an aged mother, his sublime faith
in an All~wise Father, and his
loyal service to his country make
him an example of all that is best
and noblest in life. Without re-
gard to party or creed or nation-
ality, all civilized people unite in
acknowledging him to have been
a great and good man. No high-
er praise can be given. It is
eminently ﬁtting that college stur
dents should seriously think of
this great calamity. That assas~
sinations of this kind will occur in
acivilization. and a country like
ours would seem to be impossible;
that they have occurred hasjust
been demonstrated for the third
time. It is very evident that
there is an under-current of life in
our country that is not in harmony
with existing institutions; that
there are forces at work tllat are

Fire at Ward Field.

A disastrous ﬁre involving con-
siderable loss to the Athletic
Union occiiried September 3rd.
The fence along the north side of
Ward ﬁeld was almost totally de—
stroycd. The ﬁre, aided by a
strong east wind. quickly spread
toward the west, and soon the
whole north fence was rapidly
binning. The efﬁcient work ot
the Grinnell ﬁre department, how-
ever, prevented furtller destruc-
tion.

The ﬁre undoubtedly caught
from some engine on the Central
and it is said an attempt will be
made to secure damages
