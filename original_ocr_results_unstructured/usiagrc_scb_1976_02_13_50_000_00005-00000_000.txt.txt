2Psych dept. plagued by resignations,

What can you say about a

department in which one professor
resigned about a week before classes
started . . , in which another mysteriously
, resigned in a few weeks ago . . . in which
ﬁne only two tenured proiessors will both
'be on leave next year . . . in which
enrollment in the intro course has dropped
steadily for the last four semesters? You
might say that it's in trouble. A number of
lpeople share this impression with you.

There has been a great stir created in
recent weeks at the realization that as of
right now, the psychology department for
next year consists of one man. Along with
personal problems, the department must
deal with student criticism, which has
been negative for the last several years.
The criticism revolves around the em-
piricalbehavioral-experimental orien
‘tation of the department.

Doubtlessly, many people would be
involved in psychology here that are not
now, if a broader spectrum of modern
psychological thought was covered. Un-

lortunately, a department as small as this

’ one gets iuelt into a circular dilemma on
this point. Once a given approach to the
subject is taken (i.e. behaviorism), a large
number of people with an interest in other

spects of psychology divert their in
terests and enrollment. The department
stays small or gets smaller. When students
ask for a wider range of topics within the
department, they are told, with good
reason, that the department is not large
enough to offer the topics.

This is not meant to be a criticism of the
Structure of the departmentithese are the
facts of life of a small department, and
they can only be made the best of. Among
the factors that have to be taken into ac-

Wount in this compromise are the needs

« nd wants of the present psych majors, the

needs and wanm of a “liberal arts”

community at large, along with some
dispassionate foresight into the future of

tube discipline. At the present time these

issues bear special attention due both to
the trouble that the department is in and to
the unique opportunity which is at hand for
building a new department virtually from
scratch.

A brief Sketch of where the department
stands is in order. For the past few years,
the department has maintained four full-
time teaching positions. Last year these
were held by Thomas Brozoskl, D. w.
Tyler, Jack Dohme, and idna Haller,
(Michael Hacker was also in the depart
ment as a technician and lab assistant).

John Morris, another member oi the
department, was on sabbatical. Morris,
Brozoski and Tyler had all come up for

batical at the same time and both Tyler

, and Brozoski opted to defer theirs.

t This year, Brozoski decided to take his
leave and applied to two diiterent research
[unding agencies for grants. As luck would
have it, they both came through. (Grinv
nell’s sabbatical policy is onerhalf year at
full pay, or one year at halfrpay. This
means that profs can’t. survive
tor too long without supplementary fun»
ding.) So, Browski decided to take both
grants, and with the approval of the
college, (what could they say?), will take
next year off also~with no pay.

Mr. Dohme decided not to return this

leer for personal reasons. A week before
the beginning of first semester, Morris,
who had spent his sabbatical in Europe,
decided that Grinnell wasjnat where he
wanted to be either. Finding themselves in

's sudden bind, the department hired Pat
and Helen Johnson on a part-time basis to
fill the places vacated by Morris and
Dohme in the social and developmental

‘psych, Mr. Buckholtz was hired as a lab
technician, and also taught a class this
year in the place of Brozoski. He replaced
Hacker as technician and lab assistant, so
Hacker was moved to a teaching position.

‘ Hacker. resigned for. personal reasons
two weeksagd,'leaying,'lyler','ilail‘er, Rat

Heller’s contract has not been reviewed
for next year, and Tyler is taking his
ov‘erdu‘e sabbatical next'year. Pat Johnson
was only hired as a temporary
replacement this year (but may be among
the applicants for next years posts),
leaving only Buckholtz (who was not even
hired in the capacity of a full-time
professor) for next year.

We spoke with Dean Walker about his
approach to this problem. First of all, it is

detinitelya “buyer market” in psychology
professors. Many eminently qualltled
people are looking for positions at this time
and there will probably be 10 or is people
initially considered for the posts. Nor-
mally, a department handles its own
rehiring procedures,‘ but Mr. Tyler, the
chairman, has relegated this respons
sibility to the dean. Dean Walker tens
tatively wants to cut the department from
(our to three and onerhalf teaching

Convergent approaches. . .

/n the realm of modern psychology there exists, if not
a great debate, then certainly two divergent (or as we shall
come to see, convergent} approaches to the understanding

of human behavior.

This split, roughly speaking, divides the
description of human psychology into
either behavioristic or humanistic terms.
Of course there are many iorces in
psychology which would pledge allegiance
to neither oi the above categories, but the
scope of these combined approaches is so
great in terms of the available knowledge
that any psychological discipline which
does not [all on the Continuum between
behaviorism and humanism must do So for
semantic rather than theoretical ob-
jections.

Briefly, the behavorists approach
psychology in an empirical manneri
drawing analogies irom simpler thinking
mechanisms (rats, pigeons, lower
primates, etc.) to man. The school of
thought revolves around the elegantly
simple (though seemingly obvious)
precept that an organism will engage in a
behavior that it finds pleasurable or which
has survival value and withdraw from one
which is painful. Although seemingly
simplistic, the implications of this
revelation are as far-reaching as human
behavior itself Behaviorism, like all its
postaagecflenlightenment sister sciences,
relies on strict empiricism. Nothing is
allowed into the structure of theory if it is
not supportable and explicable by
statistical evidence. It is thus the
challenge to the behavioral scientist to
engineer experiments to extract irom
the infinitely variable mileau of behavior
those qualities which statistically support
his hypothesis. Audit is thus that, behavior
by behavior, the empirical psychologists
wish to compile a complete understanding
of man‘s behavior,

Humanistic psychology has been with
us ever since man has been able to reﬂect
on his own awareness, From these naive
beginnings, this school tdeiined here as
non-empirical psychology) has remained
an important element in psychological
thought up to this day. Humanism today
reflects the attitude that certain
generalizations about behavior can be
made by the qualitative analysis of human
thoughts, feelings and actions both subs
jectively and objectively. Freud was
probably the first great nonempirical
psychologist and took psychology out of
the realm oi pure conjecture. oi course
today many psychologists take issue with
many oi the precepts of Freudian thought,
but his contribution to the science of ob
serving and systematizing psychological
phenomena cannot be underestimated.
Humanistic psychology (or “soft-
psychology” in the lingo of the
behavioristsifor obvious reasons) en»
compasses a variety of disciplines too
numerous to go into here, even shading
into philosophy, but a representative
example would be the “Esalen school” of
psychologists including the late Abraham
Maslow, Fritz Perls and Carl Rogers. The
key concept in this discipline is institution.
The state of the art is not there yet.

Human behavior encompasses a wide
range ofcomplex phenomena which can be
generalized into some very useful
categories, both in clinical terms and in
terms of helping people understand
behavioral patterns in themselves and
others. A few men of genius in humanistic
psych have arrived at proiound intuitive
insights into man's behavior and have also
been quite successful in treating mental
disorders. The obvious weak point in thi
disci ine is the fact that so much of it Is
intuitive, which leaves large gaps in
communication of theory (and large gaps
in theory for that matter).

The only reason that two such disparate
schools oi thought still exist is quite simply
that both are valid at this time. No better
testimony to the importance of intuitive
thought can be found than that offered by
the history of empirical science. Most, if
not all, of the men who have made the
greatest contributions to science have
done so in intuitive flashes of insight which
elude their own explanation. Intuition
comes first, and the empirical testing and
verification second, We’re talking about
people here like Newton, Kepler, Pasteur,
Darwin and Einstein to name just a few of
the many who have reﬂected on and
documented this process of discovery. To
Quote Einstein:

“Man tries to make for himself in
the fashion that suits himself best a
simplified and intelligible picture of
the World. He then tries to some extent
to substitute this cosmos of his for the
world of experience . . . The supreme
task is to arrive at those universal
elementary laws from which the
cosmos can be built up by pure
deduction, There is no logical path to
these laws; only intuition, resting on
sympathetic understanding of ex-
perience, can reach them , .
Psychology as a science is very young. It

is still in the stage in which what can be
explained in empirical terms is a very
small portion of what there is to be ex-
plained. Empirical psychology is moving
from the specific to the general.
Humanistic psychology is attempting to
move from the general to the specific.
Eventually. a useful empirical science oi
the mind is bound to develop out of the
research that is in its early stages at this
time. Right now, however, the “softer”
psychologies are utilizing concepm very
productively that the behavioral sciences
cannot begin to explain yet. It is a common
feature of an empirical science to debunk
those phenomena that lie outside the reach
of its explanation. Indeed, behavioral
psychology is presently engaged in clinical
work, but behavioral therapy is applicable
in only the most psychologically “simple"
and unsubtle disorders, As the science

develops, its llexibility will become

greater in clinical situations, until today‘s
humanist psychologies may seem like the
hit and miss propositions that they are.

criticisms

positions first semester next year, He says
that he wants to maintain the existing
balance in the department in terms of its
behavioralempirical orientation, but as it
stands, the onerhalt will be Cut out of the
social-developmental portion oi the
faculty: Le. one person will be hired to
replace Tyler in the field of general
behavioral psych., Buckholtz will be
moved to replace Brozoski in neurophysio
psych, while maintaining his job as
technician, and one and one»half persons
will be hired to replace Haller and Morris
in the social-developmental-personality
area oi study, in which the persons may or
may not have a behavioristic approach.
Dean Walker says he has been told that
empiricallycriented psychology is “where
it’s at in the country.” He will undoubtedly
conduct his search with this in mind.

Among psych majors, concern is run-
ning very high about the future oi the
department, and close scrutiny is being
paid to the dean’s action in the matter. A
iew majors have voiced objection to the
possibility of the department becoming
even more behavioristically oriented than
it already is, whereas others, eyeing grad
schools which prefer strong' scientitic
background, want all the empiricism they
can get. It would seem that among the
psych EPC's there exists a 3:2 split, three
favoring at least the noticeable presence of
the “softer" non-empirical disciplines, the
other two favoring a very heavy empirical
orientation. Last week Dean Walker met
with what turned out to be one of the three
and both of the other two to try and gauge
the student sentiment in the department.

There is one thing that all of the majors
who attended a meeting on Monday could
agree on, and that was the concern that the
students were going to have less-than-
usual input into the selection process. In
the interest oi economy, Dean Walker
wants to travel to an area in which he
could meet with a large number of can-
didates (Chicago, New York . . .) without
incurring the expense of bringing them all
here. So far so good, but the majors are
apprehensive that the selection process
might be conducted entirely off-campus
contrary to established procedure. The
EPC members would like the right to
interview the candidates personally and
review their resumes. It remains to be
seen how this process will be effected.

Another point on which the majors
agreed was in disapproval of hints by the
dean that the certain departments of
psychologyistatistics and social psych
might successiully be merged with
departments in the sociology department.
The suggestion has been withdrawn by the
administration but me majors felt that is
original suggestion showed little respect
for either department.

One of the most common and oft»
discussed academic questions around
Grinnell is “what is the role of a liberal
arts institution?" Without. entering the
debate with a general formula, it seems
fair to point out that on the undergraduate
level some effort needs to be extended
toward assuring that all of the major
schools of thought in a given field will be
presented in an unbiased, non-cynical
manner, and that the size ot a department
not be used as an excuse for its failings in
this area, tor this is a self-perpetuating
phenomenon. The psychology department
is in the rare position of being able to
examine its prioriLies and effect some
changes based on such an evaluation. This
position can either be exploited to the
school‘s advanhage, or merely patched up

. with potentially disastrous con-
sequences, Nobody wans to major in a
department with the obvious lack of
stability that the psych department has
suffered. A shrinking department seems
to draw shrinking priority irom the
school’s administration and this vicious
circle can result in the dissolution at a
department. Thus the questions at hand go
beyond the mere staffing of next year's
psych department, and range into the very
role of psychology at ,a school such as

. ‘Grinnell.
