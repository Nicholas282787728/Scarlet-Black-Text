GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

By Stuart Roeder

Mr, Prescott flicked the ash off
of his cigarette. He, two student
,helpers, a couple of filing cabi.
‘nets, some shelves, two desks, a
typewriter, a telephone, a black
board, and a table, all packed
into a little room on third floor
ARH, are Griniiell college's pub-
licity department.

Have you wondered how your
name popped up in your little
hometown weekly or your big
city daily? Did you try to fig-
}ure out how they knew that you
iiiad given a recital, been select»
ed to Tassels or some other oi-gae
nizatian? Were you flattered that
the people back home would hear-
labout you at college?

Well, that's Mr. Prescott, Each‘
week news releases leave ms of-
fice for hometown papers. In
these releases there‘ are generally
about two major stories and
twentyrfive minor articles. One
release about you may go to
your town paper and the other
to a big city sheet. For exam»
ple: suppose Betty Senior gives
a chapel music recital. A re-
lease will go to her hometown,,

Podiink, and since Podunk is a
suburb of Chicago, a release will
probably be sent no one of the
larger metropolitan papers. An-
Grinnell paper.

But the department doesn't
handle student publicity alone.
Mr. Alumnus from a suburb of
Sacramento, California, gives the
college five thousand dollars. A
release will he sent to the sub
urban paper. Revised releasesl
will be sent to the Sacramento
papers. Another set of revised
releases will go to the Des
Moines papers. A third set of
revised releases will he sent to
other major dailies. A fourth
revision will go to the Griiinell
town paper. A fifth will bci
used for the Alumni Scarlet midi
Black, and a sixth revised re-i
lease will appear in the Scarlet
and Black.

That‘s just a taste of the news-l
paper side of the department":
The Alumni Scarlet and niacin.
of which Mr. Prescott is aeting
editor, is included in this catrl
egory. But there are still the
radio and various pamphlets and
booklets to be mentioned,

college Leagues of Women Voters:
Led by Mrs. C. E Payne, thei
panel of three members told the
meeting of the various phases of.
our relations with the countries
of the southern hemisphere.

Mrs. Payne emphasized the
change of our policy from accept-
ance of the Monroe Doctrine as
a unilateral agreement to the
present concept of an agreement
between all the nations of the
Americas, Nevertheless, we were
not prepared in 1940 to defend
the western hemisphere singly or
collectively.

of Chile asked that a conference
of foreign ministers be called.
The outstanding result of the
subsequent meeting held in Jan-
uary, 1942, was ”the adoption of
a resolution recommending thatl
the American Republics break off
their diplomatic relations with
Japan, Germany, and Italy. Parr
alleiing the resolution of the
breaking of diplomatic relations
was that on the severance of
commercial and financial ties.”

These resolutions were not com-
pletely carried out due to the
peculiar situation of Chile, who
felt that she could not.break re-
lations because of the vulnerabilr
ity of her coastline, and of Ar-
iiot desire to
give up valuable markets or risk
losing them in the future.

Mrs. John Martin related the
little known Mexican water
Treaty, now before the Senate,
and the implications it carries
as to the attitude of the United
states Senate toward cooperation
with other nations after the war.

Post-War Economies

Mrs. L, B. Watt told of the'
results of the recent conference
held at Chapultepec, Mexico.
Known as the InterrAmel'iCall
Conference on War and Peace.
it met from February 21 to

'March a. On the subject of post-

war economics Mrs. Watt said.
“Economic repercussions are
bound to be felt throughout many
Latin-American republics once the
allied war machine does not stand
ready to consume anything and

To take up the slack which will
result, an Economic Charter
which will serve as a common
guide for the American repube
iics took shape at the confer-
ence.”

The next meeting of the college
league will he held Monday,
March 19, at 7:30 in Haines par-
ior.
