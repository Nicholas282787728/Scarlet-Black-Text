Much oi the time 01 these meetings

The trustees have found at the end
of the college year a delicit or “6.027,
due partially to the failure of the
First National Bank, partially to ex-
traordinary expenses not anticipated,
butprincipally to the iaot that the
endowment has not been suilicicntior

The Trustees have grappled hard
with the problem of ﬁnances and hare
succeeded in raising h-omrhe individ-
ual members of the board. members
of the faculty and friends all but
of this amount and it is expected the
balance will he raised so that the Col-

from debt. it is also expected that
the deﬁcit next year will be very much
smaller.

During the past year the college re-
ceived more in cash and pledges
than during any other year
or its history and never has it
had a stronger faculty and only during
