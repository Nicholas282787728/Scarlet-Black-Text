We here at the 58:3 realized that pens
ple usually don’t know a lot about the
R.A.s on campus (and some don't even
know their own). So we decided to in-
troduce you to all of the R.A.s by way of
a short profile.

The way things work around here, if
you have a problem and your no. is not
around, you are supposed to call
Enamel” R.A. We hope that this article
will acquaint you with them so that if a
situation ever arises. you'll know
something about the person that you
are going to see.

Bearded and soft-spoken, Stuart Men»
singer brings to the RA. job a wide
range of experience in “peopleoriented
fields.”

Alter graduating from college at I]-
linois State University, the Illinois
native spent some time working as a
supervisor-counselor in a minimum
security Juvenile Corrections Center.
“i did lots of crisis work; prevention
and intervention and work in drug pr0~
grains," Stuart said.

Aiter receiving his Masters De ce in
College Student Personnel Admi stra-
tion at lndiana University, he worked
[or a while in a head start program.
Aiter quitting work there, Stuart ex-
plained that, “I know lenyoyed working
with groups. l'm interested in vehicles
for accomplishing tasks outside the
classroom. But I swore l0 myseli that
I’d never work in a residence hall."

Stuart explained that he met Dean
Jim Tederman on a lal'k and found out
about. the RA. job at Grinnell. When he
interviewed for the job he did already
know something about Grimiell, "both

my parents went here," Stuart said,
And now he Is the R A. lor Norris and
Cowles, where his lather lived many
years ago

”1 had been all RA. at Indiana."
Stuart said, reilecting on the 1th. job at
Grinncll, "but it's different here. ldoii'l
have to get involved wilh being a
disciplinarian and administrator: i can
have genuine contact will] the
students."

As for his impressions ol Grinnell so
tar, Stuarl mentioned a variety at
things. ”The town is good for late night
walks. but low on bagels "

Second year RA. Jeffrey Montague
returns to Grinnell having enjoyed his
first year and looking forward to being
more eilective in his second,

A wide variety ot experience in the
human services field and the ability to
get along with people on all levels are
some of the qualiﬁcations that are look-
ed for when hiring a Resident Adviser
(R.A.), according to Janet Carli
Associate Dean at Student Altairs.

Carl said that when the college hires
R.A.S they are “looking [or people with
a wide range of people skills." She went
On to explain that other desirable
qualifications in an RA. included: be-
ing able to handle an unstructured time
schedule, ﬂexibility, and strong skills in
advising, counseling, and meditation.

Before Grinnell had an EA. pro»
gram, which started about 12 years
ago. they had house mothers. "They
(the studensi literally drove them out
of the halls," Car] said. She explained
that during the 60's the notion of "in
loco parentus" began to change around
Grinnell.

“Rules were changing and drugs
were becoming more of an issue," Carl
said. “The mothers just didn't have the
necessary expertise or training to res~
pond to the students. They needed some
one who could respond to the students
on more of a peer level."

So the RA. program began, with
seven R.A,s taking on responsibility tor
Grinnell’s l7 dorms and eight off cams
pus project houses, in which 90 percent
of Grinnell's students live.

NOW. some 50 or 60 R.A.s later. the
program is a well established part oi
lire at Grinnell.

This year there are four new R.A.s on
campus. and like all of the other RA 5
they were part of the'college's annual
search for the "type" oi person to till
the Job oi an EA.

The process ior hiring an RA. is a
rather involved project. "We are look
ing for people with Masters degrees in
some human services field." Carl-ex-
plained. "We usually don't pursue pear
ple jusl out at college unless they have
had social work experience ol some
kind. like being an rm, at another
school." Carl stated that most aps
pllcalits hold MA. degrees in student
counseling

The college advertises the li.A job in
national education journals and in the
Affirmation Action Register. as Carl
noted “we are always looking for
minority candidates."

Carl explained that it's getting a little
tougher to till the position or an R A.
“There are a lot oi people who have had
experience in uiidergradutato oi
graduate schools. and now want to go
right to work in an oliioe setting, There
are also just iewer people in these types
ot programs." According to Carl there
were about 100 applicants lor this
year‘s openings,

After the applicants reply and some
basic weeding out is done the college
writes back to the applicants. "We want
to know their philosophies of residence
hall llvuig," Carl said.

When the college has a list oi can~
didates they ask each one to conic to
Grinnell to look around and have all ll‘i'
terView when they come to the campus

they are talked to by the R A. selection
committee. Carl said that this commit-
tee consists oi "all the present R.A.s;
all Di the beans 1“ Student Affairs. lhc
