“The cool people don’t hang out anymore”

A five year retrospect

by John Doe. alum.

Five years ago, when I came to Grinnell,
i came to a very ditierent place, of course
that's a subjective judgment which might
have more to do with the tact that I have
grown two years older than Grinnell has
There's no doubt 7 you take on years,
years that are tull ot fantasy and flux, and
your view changes. What once was cool
now seems foolish: what once was brilliant
now seems overblown. single-minded. in-
secure; what once was loved is now hated

some might say that this signiiied ao-
ceptance on the part at the campus com-
Inunity; maybe that's true. But there also
seems to be the pervasive ieeling oi. “The
decisions been made, what can ido about
it? " The student, instead oi ieelmg respon-
sible ior his school, has become the ward
or the administration Nobody asks. “Why
weren't we asked? why weren't we allow
ed to say yes or no to graffiti?" Nobody
questions authority.

 

One way to escape the reality of these
changes is to View them as not really ex-
isting in the world but existing in myself.
Yet, when 1 try to step back irom myseli,
when I try to look at this college in as ob-
jective a sense as possible, i still see
change, what type oi change? Well. I
reserve personal judgment ior the end oi
this essay.

The fairest way to describe the change is
to describe certain phenomenon that oc-
curred tour and live years ago and com-
pare them to similar phenomenon that
have happened this year. li memory has
tailed me, or I led to recognize certain
aspects oi these situations as they exist to-
day, l apologize
Bathroom Graffiti ill Hurling

What a strange situation to start out
with, you might say Graffiti has been
deemed Childish and, more importantly,
nonexistent in Burling Library bathrooms
The iirst opinion is a value judgment 7
something that will always exist. Tlle 397
wild is a unilateral decision on the part of
those who run the library,

Four years ago. the same decision to
remove grailiti from the bathroom walls
was made by those in power There were oi
course the usual value judgments tor and
against grailiti. it's a moot point. But the
most important argument was that nobody
had asked the campus community how
they ielt about the graiiiti,

Four years ago there seemed to be the
leeling that the college belonged to the
students who went here. The money lor the
library. as the money ior most things are.
either came directly from the students or
had been given ior Specific use by the
students. The college existed [or the stu-
dent

The administrators were simply
caretakers of the college, not the people
who owned it A cry or anger and pi-ot -t
rose up iroin the student body. How dare
they impose a value judgment on us, such
as questioning the integrity oi the
bathroom graffiti, without asking us, The
people who made the decision were iinally
made to see the error oi their ways, and
through the sway oi the campus Communi~
ty, graiiiti was allowed back in the
bathroom.

This year. after the reopening oi Burlc
mg, grailiti was once again banned from
the campus. Once again, nobody bothered
to ask thc campus community about this,

skip Day

i suppose the most tun day or my college
career would have to be my iirst skip day.
Grinnell itself had a fairly festive at-
mosphere, parties everywhere at all times
oi the day or night. 0t course, being a
ireshman, l was more concerned with try-
ing to look like I actually knew someone at
these parties than like i was havmg a good
time

when Skip Day iinally was announced,
all hell broke loose on campus. It. was as if
somebody had stretched a rubberhand
tighter and tighter until it was so full of
tension that it was about to break, and then
suddenly let go.

People who hadn't smiled in weeks were
doing somersaults through the halls. Even
the most serious students were down in the
Pub for dune draws. I never heard them
myself, but I‘ve been told that 'Nrner and
Walker got on the radio and told everybody
to skip the next day.

Everybody on the campus had decided
that being serious was only worthwhile it
you remembered to take a little time off to
be foolish every once in a While. I‘ll be
honest — Skip Day was a license to revert
back to being a child ior a day. running
with yarn through central campus and
linger painting on sidewalks. But for
twelve hundred students who spend four
years resting between childhood and
adulthood, it was a welcome break froln
the pain and pressure of Grinnell,

it was the surprise, the spontaneity of

to be important events on this campus
People would start the all-campus party
soon after dinner. There would be an in-
timate party in somebody's room, People
would be talking about the band that night,
how many kegs were going to be at the para
ty, politics and the chicken croquettes that
Dave McConnell dared to serve for dinner
tsome things never change).

The intimate parties would soon flow in-
to small parties — people carrying the
good times, liquor and chicken croquettes
with them The small parties would flow
into medium parties, which would iinally
ilow into the all-campus party. People
didn't go to the allrcampus parties expec»
ting to have a good time. They usually
brought a good time with them, not to men
tlon the liquor and the chicken croquettes,

These days the best thing to say about an
all-campus party is that you didn't go, The
gym |S too dark, the band is too loud,
nobody talks to anybody, and they always
run out oi beer too quickly. when theres
no music, everybody stands around and
complains about how long a break the

“What once was cool now seems foolish;
what once was brzlhant now seems over
blown, smgle-mmded, msecure”

Skip Day that made it as great as it was 7
like an unexpected phone call from a close
iriend, or a piece oi good news out oi the
blue.

Skip Day is no longer sanctioned, and it
has lost more and more or its liie as time
has gone on. There was a Skip Day this
year, but i doubt very many people knew
about it. There was a keg oi beer. a iew
people and a couple of toys, but it resembl-
ed a graveyard oi Skip Day more than Skip
Day itseli,

People went to classes 7 they wouldn't
think at missing one, Professors who used

 

Around the end oi September, though,
anticipation started rising [or what most
people seemed to consider the greatest
Grinncll party oi them all 7 Skip Day.
"What's a skip day?" I asked in my ig-
norance, A sophomore looked at me and
smiled. "Everybody just takes a day oii
from life and has a good time." "When is
it?" I continued in my mundane lgc
norance. “That's just it 7 you never know
when Skip Day is until it actually
happens,"

For days people would be checking
weather reports, stocking up on party sup»
plies and trying to gain some inside inior-
mation. The anticipation of Skip Day ‘
that something wonderful was going to
happen at some unexpected moment, ior
no other reason than that everybody in the
vicinity wanted something wonderful to

, happen 7 was almost as exciting as skip

’Day itself. or so I thought:

to sit on the lawn and laugh with students
on Skip Days oi the past steered clear oi
these rebels. other students. passing by
the celebration on their way to the library,
only stared — wearing the same tension on
their iaccs that they wore every other day
oi the year. and wondering how such good
studying time could be wasted.

Those who participated in skip Day obe
viously telt restricted, self~conscious.
They spent more time sipping beer and
trying to look cool rather than throwing
themselves into childish fantasies. Two
students. in a fit of whimsy. tried to recap
ture some of the spirit oi the day. They
went up to the library and painted "tilt" on
it. They were later accused of Vandalism
and were given a sound tonguect ‘ shing
by the administration because ‘people
shouldn't write on their library,’
All-Campus Purties

Believe it or not, allccampus parties used

band is taking. when there is music.
everybody stands around and complains
about the band.

It's like everybody is taking a prepara~
tlon course for living in New Jersey. I'm
not sure what the reason for this is. but I do
know that when I ask people ii they're goe
ing to the Loose l-lall Ball, they oiten say.
"Yeah, well I may study until 10:30 or 11
and then stop by,"

in see those people around midnight,
standing clear-eyed and with periect
speech, and I’d ask them how they were
doing, and they'd say “I don't know about
these all»campus parties, I'm just bored
The Forum Beach and the Pub Nightclub

People at Gl'innell used to hang out
more. They didn't do anything, they
weren‘t going anywhere, they weren't get-
ting anything out or it On a sunny day the
Forum beach was always crowded. People
would be decked out in sunglasses and
shorts, music boxes would be blaring, and
the beer would be flowing. It wasn't a holic
day it was just a sunny aiternoon.

The other great place to hang out was on
the sides of the steps leading down to the
Pub, This is where the cool people used to
hang out and party, There are times when
I remember it being more crowded outSlde
the Pub than inside,

The Forum beach still exists. but not to
the same degree, People seem more ten-
tative about hanging out, more guilt-
rldden. The most often used phrase in the
vicinity is, “Well, I‘ll sit down {or a few
minutes, but I really have to be getting
back to the library."

The Pub nightclub? Well, that seems to
have gone the way oi Skip day and the late
drop date. lviaybe I'm just a bit bitter 7 I
finally feel cool enough to hang out with
the cool people, and the cool people don't
hang out anymore.

So maybe i haven’t been quite as objece
twe as ['d have like to have been in this lit-
tle essay. 1 read through it, and my point oi
view seems to be tearing through these
words like a sharp knife through tissue
paper. But Grinnell does seem to have
changed, and the students seem to have
changed. 7 i think ior the worse.

The seriousness of the student body
seems to have increased, while the foolish,
childish. fun-loving, rebellious attitude
seems to have decreased. Some people
might think that's good 7 you can‘t be
foolish with a computer or rebellious with
an equation.

That's where our society seems to be go-
ing. But it might be beneiicial to
remember that many of the lnost creative
people in history were foolish, childish and
rebellious.
