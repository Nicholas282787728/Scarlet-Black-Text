As Handicapped Team
Prepares for Drake

A not too hopeful track
/ squad will compete with
Drake this evening in a dual

indoor meet at Des Moines.

Crippled by the loss of letter
man Bill Goding to measles, and
further handicapped by inexper-
ience and poor indoor track
equipment, thc team expects some
tough going against the Des
Moines school.

coach G. Lester Duke is look-
ing for a long distance runner
since both Shoiilberg and Goding,
who reported at the first of the
season for that post, are unavail-
able.

Grinncu may have a strong
hurdles man in Bob Gorrlgan,
Duke reports. If his performance
at Drake is creditable, he will be
added to the small squad attend-
ing the Illinois Tech Relays in
Chicago next Saturday.

Those entered are Bob Corrie
~gen, Paul Boat, Augie Gruen-
ing, Ross Notaro, Bob Friend,
Curly Bishop, Murray Richards,
Bob Lcitner, Dean ,Ncwcll, Jack
Mankey, Dave Matlack, Dick
Gadient, Ed Nagcl, John Clinton,
Bill McKeon, Lefty Soiy, Doug
strong, and Jerry Grant,

Taking two ti ts out of eight
events, the Grinncll incrincn fin»
islied in a disappointing runncl‘rup
position or the Midwest confcr-
ence meet Saturday.

Sophomore Johnny (31le won
the 50 yard free style in what
was almost a dead heat with Tun
ley and Smith of Lawrence.

Dud Conner was the Pioneer’s
other winner with a first in the
100 yard breast stroke. The meet
was held in the Rockford West
high school pool at Rockford, Ill.

Giles lost his first race of the
year when Smith beat him by
nearly a length in the 100 yard
fiice style. Nevertheless, he finish-
ed way out ahead as the best
Pioneer sconer of the season.

It was the last meet for three
Pioneers. The three seniors are
Co-captain Bob Jensen, who came
in second in the 150 yard back
stroke; Coccaptaln Bob Stewart
