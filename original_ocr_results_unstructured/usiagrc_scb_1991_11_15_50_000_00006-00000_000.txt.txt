The truth to the symbol

We can only hope that the person who persists in drawtng swastikas on
a Jewish student‘s door does not realize the full implications of what he or
she is doing. Perhaps this person who has chosen to employ such a powerful
emblem of hate doesn't realize why the swastika is such a repungnant and
inexcusable symbole- not only to Jews but to anyone who cares at all about
human life and dignity. We can only hope that the person who has done this
is nothing more than a painfully unenlightened individual. Perhaps they have
never had a Jewish friend to tell them about murdered cousins or great aunts
whose ashes were used to produce fertilizer. Or perhaps they have received
their education about World War II solely by watching reruns of Hogan's
Heroes. In any case, a short history lesson is in ordert

In 1910, the German nationalist Guido von List recommended the
swastika as an insignia by which Germans could advertise their anti-
Semiticism. The Nazi party, when
it was formed ten years later, adopted
the swastika as its own. In 1935,
Hitler mandated that the swastika
become the centerpiece of the new

of World War II, the swastika was

the emblem which flew over the extermination camps of the Third Reich.

53 years ago this past week the Nazis, with the swastika as their official
symbol. began their rage of terror against European Jewry. Within a few
years, extermination camps were systematically massacring hundreds of
thousands of people The Nazis, with the swastika as their official symbol,
manufactured lampshades from human skin, made soap from body fat, and
stuffed pillows with the hair of those they exterminatedr They developed
super-efﬁcient machines for crushing the bones of their millions of victims.
The Nazis raped women and, nine months later, bound the legs of these
women so that they could not give birth and the mother and child would die.
At leastsix million Jews, more than two times as many people whocurrently
live in Chicago. were killed by the Nazis. And the swastika was the Nazis‘
ofﬁcial symbol.

The person who continues to scrawl swastikas on the Student's door here
is, whether they know it or not, invoking all of tltis history every time they
do so. They are invoking an emblem which symbolizes the extermination
of not only Jewsbut also people of color. gays and lesbians, and a myriad of
other groups. The swastika is a symbol of intense emotion and power. To
whoever insists on abusing these emotions: Stop.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Christian students speak out Swastikas

To the editor.

Due to a recent rash of verbal
attacks against Christians that have
occurred on this campus, we decided
this letter needed to be written.

In the time that has passed since
retumingtoGrinnell from FallBreak,
therehavebeenlivespeciﬁcinstances
of verbal attack. This letter is not
intended to single out any one person
or incident. Instead, we wish to ex—
press the general feelings and atti-
tudes we have faced as Christians on
this campus.

One of the most recent attacks
portrayed Christians as oppressed
under the bondage of religion, An4
other implied Christians were prud-
ish and insensitive Another claimed
that Christians do not think for them-
selves. and that there are no “real”
Christians. Yet another pictured
Christians as conniving to get their
point across. And another called de-
votion to Jesus “scaryt” Within these
attacks, there was horrendous misun~
derstanding, merciless jeering and
closedrminded (yes, closedminded)
stereotyping. Although we do not
deny the abuses of religion, we stand
in our relationship with Jesus Christ
as testimony of a different standard.

However, it should be emphasized
that derision has not been limited to
the past Week alone. In classes bom-
agains have been derided, missionar~
ies ridiculed, Christian faith deemed
archaic and inaccurate information
regarding the faith distributed. Most
frequently theseattacksblindly lashed
out at Christians, with no consider-

ation of who these individuals might
be, calling them oppressed, closedr
minded,narrowrmindedbn-intellec-

Deminoff
clarifies

statements
To the editor.

The article “Data sheds light on
true level of campus diversity" in the
November 8 issue of the Scarlet and
Black provided valuable information
about the history and current state of
the minority presence atGrinnell. At
the very end of the article, however,
the writer states that “Deminoff said
he believes Grinnell has made Sig-
nificantprogress in recruiting minor-
ity students, faculty and administra-
tion. The statistics appear to support
his assertion."

The assertion I made had to do
with the recmitment of women on
campus, not minorities. I believe we
have made signiﬁcant progress in the
recruitment of women, although we
still have a dismnce to go even in this
category. But as the former affirma-
tive action officer of the college, no
one knows better than I that we have
a very long way to go in the recruit-
ment of minorities on campus. The
statistics cited in the article certainly
do not support the assenion that the
Writer of the article attributed to me.

represent
hate, fear

To the editor,

This letter is directed to tltepcrson
who continues to paint swastikas on a ‘
Jewish student's door.

I want to ask you--why? Why
would you take a symbol of ferocious '
hate and display it as a message ofv
intimidation fortthcwish people on ’
this campus? Why would you strive
to hurtan individual because of what "
s/he believes? Why don't you have ‘
the courage to stand behind your ideas
and admit who you are‘.7 Why do you ‘
believe this act of hate will accom» .
plish something? Why do you think
you are going to frighten us?

you put the effort into your work like’
you do bitching and whining, you~
would get along a lot better. ‘

DINOSAUR DAYS
How can you not be a feminist?

Ilike lesbians. A 10L They seem to
be the only ones who give a damn
about feminist issues. Since return»
ing to Grinnell this fall,I have noticed
a disturbing lack of support for femi-
nist concerns from the heterosexual
female population on campus There
are also altogether too few men who
are actively concemedt Feminism
should not be limited by gender or
sexual orientation. So why does it
seem to be?

Maybe the lesbians are justa more
visible group. It'spossible that statis-
tically, the numbers who go to hear
feministspeakers,attend PAFAmeet—
ings and participate in such events as
Women Take Back the Night. are
merely representative of the percent-
age of gay women on campus.

Assuming, however, that there are
a disproportionate number of lesbir
ans actively caring about “women’s
issues," then I must wonder why this
is the case. I suspect that it lies in the
word FEMINIST.

Is feminist still a bad word? Does
being gay necessarily raiseapcrson‘s
awareness of discrimination and force
her/him to acknowledge the impora
tance of an individual’s rights? Is it,

Ann
Treistman

to the gay population, just one more
label from an oppressive society? A
society which tells men Ihatonly “fair-
ies” are feminist?

One of my friends conﬁded in me
that she felt inadequate sitting nextto
lesbians at feminist gatherings. She
thought that lesbianism was the high-
est form of feminism, for it showed
that women were strong individuals
who didn't need men. “I can’t help
it," she told me, “I just like men
better."

Feminism is notaboutnot needing
mcn.Itisaboutmakingwomcn count.
I used to deny being a feminist I‘m
not one of those bitter, resentful
women who hate men,I said. I’m still
not. However, I am a feminist. Why?

How many women do you know
whohavehadabortions?0rwhohave
been raped? 0r who have been ig»
nored? To me, feminism is about car-
ing enough to speak out. It is about
stopping the backlash of blamewhich
society subjects every woman to. It’s

about stopping the doctors who pata
woman‘s behind as she leaves his‘
office after being treated for genital y
warts, murmuring for her to “be more I
careful next time and make me proud
of you." It‘s about stopping the igno- '
rance.

How can you not be a feminist?

Feminism acknowledges that‘
women are intelligent; that we are .
capable of controlling our own bod»
ies; that we cannot be treated as any- '
thing less than full-ﬂedged human4
beings. So why aren‘t more people.
openly supportive of feminist con-
cerns? ‘

Evenwithoutthcctnswer.I‘llclimb,
down from my soapbox, Iknow that
there are more feminists out there'
than I have indicated. Hopefully ev-.
eryone has just been too busy to at-‘
tend the lectures, or to go to PAFA
meetings. I admit that I’ve missed ar
meeting or two myself. 1 just worry
that you might be hesitant to call
yourselfa fcministfor fearthatothers‘
will make assumptions. So what ifv
they do?

Feminists give a damn about
women’s rights. And you don’t have’
to'be gay or a woman to do that.
