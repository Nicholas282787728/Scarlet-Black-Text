o WILL WE GET IT? T

Barring capitulation by the Student Council
to the inevitable modicum of student criti-
cism, some 730 Grinnell college students
seem destined to receive a mild Shock some
starry night as members of the campus
governing body, moved upon the one hand
by the spirit of service and on the other by
irresistible languor induced by spring, will
cock their weather eyes aloft, consult a
calendar to verify the fact that the follow-
ing day is a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thurs
day, and begin burning up the telephone
wires to get permission from the faculty to
hold the first ”Spring Day” in the history
of Grinnell.

If all goes well, the morrow would bring
an allrcollege picnic, including the faculty as
well as students, in addition to whatever
program the Student Council, working with
the pep committee, may have devised.

The purpose of the “Spring Day,” as we '

understand the plan passed by the Council
last February, is to promote school spirit
and college unity, It is an attempt to ameli»
orate conditions such as those present ill the
Victory Day force of last fall,

We have not been disillusioned into
thinking that a Grinnell college Spring Day
can develop ill Grinnell students the flashing
eye and rapid pulse of a Red on May Day.

GRINN ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

We are well aware of the low saturation
poillt ' Grinnell college enthusiasm as evi-
denced in recent years.

However, we have seen a new spark and
spirit in the football team that may well
be taken up by the student body as a whole
during the Spring Day activities The crux
of the matter is this: The Student Council
had an IDEA when the Spring Day plan
was formulated, It is inevitable that it
should. have met opposition, but we do not
think that it is necessary for that opposi—
tion to force the Council into reconsideration
and possible killing of the idea before it has
had a fair trial.

Our own feeling on the matter is that
ideas are so rare a product of student gOVs
ernment that even the most flaccid of them
mtlst be handled with the utmost delicacy
lest it suffocate ill the all-pervasive atmos-
phere of student t0lpor.

If Spring Day is to become an event
worth continuing, we must discover that
fact this year by giving it a fair trial, If
it is a failure, let’s bury the corpse quickly,
not allow it to exist mummified for Grinnell
posterity.

0 TOWARD BETTER ELECTIONS

Now that the bacltrpatting, buttonrholing,
hand-shaking, “hirya fellows" of the Girl-
llell campus elections are over, it is just
about time we sat back and took stock.

The Scarlet and Black has no quarrel
with the men elected, but it is dissatisfied
with the methods used, especially in the
Student Council election. When one hall
nominates just its six juniors for Student
Council president without any consideration
of their qualifications; when one faction re-
lies on whispering campaigns; and when the
other side works to keep a certain hall out
of the elections regardless of the qualifica-
tions of its members, then there is plenty
of room for improvement.

Although student government doesn’t
mean much here at Grinnell we do have it.
And we may as well elect representatives
on the merit rather than the “baby-kissing"
basis.

The indications are that the new Student
Council constitution, providing- for all-school
representatives chosen from the sophomore
and freshman classes, will be adopted. In such
an election, it is more than liliely that the
qualifications of the candidates will be little
known to the campus-atrlarg‘ . Hence, what
better time than now could be found to
attempt some improvement in election cuss
toms at Grinnell.

The Scarlet and Black believes that the
problem could be at least partially solved by
reserving one or more chapel periods [or
regular “campaign speeches,” giving each
candidate an opportunity to set forth his
program and qualifications

Why not‘.7 At least, an attempt at such
a procedure could do no harm, And it would
give the student body somewhat more than
its usual basis for a decision.

Nazi Invasion [5

An Attempt To
Find Ore Route

By William 0. M.—

Venturing to express the opinion
that the Scandinawan hullahaloo
might best be considered apart
from nonexistent international
“morals," News Views last week
incurred the wrath of certain of
our more violent Hitler-haters.

But as lust su‘c’h a reaction was
confidently expected from those
sources, we are not too greatly
disturbed, believing, instead, that
the reasons for Germany's move
may be of more practical inter-
est thah the “morals” involved,

Unfortunately for struggling
commentators and would—be pros
phets, most of the factsﬁespecial—
ly the vital ones—are as yet bur-
led in the stench of wartime se-
crecy and propaganda. But even
so. there are certain factors in
the question which throw some
light upon the motives behind
the Nazi coup.

Fact number one: Swedish ore
is vitally important to the Ger-
man war economy. Without it,
the Reich would be severely hand-
icapped in its efforts to continue
its submarinebuilding campaign,
upon which the Nazis pin much
of their hopes for crippling the
British fleet. And aside from the
Usboat program, there is the
equally important necessity of
constant replacement in branches
of the military.

This ultramecessaiy ore can be
secured only from Sweden. Rus-
sia's resources, even if they were
of suitable quality, can not be
made available to the Germans in
sufficient quantity because of the
inadequacy of the Russian trans-
portation system.

Moreover the enhanced value
of the Swedish ore can be realized
when one considers that Germany
no longer controls the rich min,
cral resources of Alsace-Lorraine
and the northeastern p t of
France as she did in lolarinls.

Fact number two:
transportation facilities, on land
and territorial waters alike, are
necessary to bring this ore to Ger-
man ports. Especially is this true
since the Baltic is open to navi—
gation only part of the year, and
even then, the Swedish poi-ts u
on that sea do not possess facili-
ties for handling the are in odes
quatc quantities. Neither do the
the Swedish and Norwegian rail—
ways offer sufficient transporta-
tion without the water route

Norwe glen

Thus. the use of the outside
Norwegian territorial waters and
control of that country’s Nthh
Sea ports became an integral; rt
of Nazi strategy,

Fact number three- niitain
gave every evidence of designs
upon Norway's routes, going so
far as to mine hcr tcrrito lot we.
tel's, Whether John Bu 5 plans
went any further than
lcr claims that the Blltisll were
the t to consider invading No ,
way; s not known. But the mr -
cations, especially the mine-lav
ing, would point to an English
program to sever these conimlc
nications,

Hence, in the most spectacular
move of his career, Hitler struck
to gain undisputed control of
these transport lines. \ththe:
he has bargained for more than

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17, 1940

he can-handle is at present
moot question. But, at any rate,
he has made the bargain,
