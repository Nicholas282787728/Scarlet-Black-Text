Word Processor
Should Not Be
FreshmenOnly

The new word processor on the
VAX is a welcome addition to the
Grinnellcampus, However.inorder
for it to be utilized, it is necessary
that a system to teach WordPertect
be created.

Recently, Computer Services has held computer workshops to teach
the system, but these have been limited only to freshmen. This decision.
while it does save the time of Computer Services employees, prevents
upperclassmen from being able to use the word processor they lobbied for.

What goodishavinganew system when only onequarterof the campus
is able he actually use it? Upperclass students cannotbe expected to learn
by osmosis

Computer Services must create classes for all students who desire to
learn WordPerfect. Obviously this will take additional time. but it is a
wonhwhile expense considering the quality of the new program. These
classes must be organized soon, because as the semester progresses, many
students will be too burdened to take advantage of the courses.

lfthis is impossible, the pamphlet outlining the basicsof how to access
ﬁles, format text, and printpapets that Computer Services claims to have
should be made more available for general student use.

To ignore the desire of sophomoresjuniors. and seniors who want to
use WordPerfect, relying instead on a systematic, phasing-out period of
several years is unconscionable. Denying them access to the quality
program because they arrived a year or two too early is completely unfair
and ridiculously improper.

Where Have All
the Pillows Gone

Studentsliving in thedormitories
experienced a rude awakening this
semesterwhen they discovered that
the pillows that had once graced
every bed were removed over the
summer.

Difﬁculty in cleaning was the reason given for this cryptic removal of
pillows, Perhaps they were difficult to clean. but wouldn‘t other nasty
objects on campus have to follow suit. For example, due to their strange
odors and stains, one tries to avoid all direct contact with mattress covers.
How aboutlounge furniture? Unless a lounge is decked out in thatcheesy
vinyl we’re all so fond of, cleaning furniture is an impossible task. 0r
consider the bathroom walls in Burling. Why don’twe rid ourselves now
of all these “nasties’”!

The elimination of the pillows is a tragic event, yet one most Grinnell
students could have handled had they been clearly notiﬁed. Tom Crady
insists that students received a letter outlining the disappearance of the
pillows. But most students fail to remember this memo. In fact, many
students spent their first few nights in Spartan conditions, Thankfully,
WalMart was prepared, and had pillows on sale thatweek.

The pillow controversy leaves two questions in the minds of Grinnell
students First, what will the college deem as unsanitary in the future?
Second, where the hell are all those pillows?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Reader Offers Krauss New Ideas

To the editor,

A few suggestions for Eric

Krauss‘ next pseudo-editorial:

PRETTY NEAT SCOTCH
TAPE. WhyisitScotch'! Isn’tthat
offensive to Scottish people? Is it
made in Scotland? Do Scots get
royalty money from the proﬁts? Is
it just as evil as tuna’!

PRETTY N AT RIGHT
GUARD Whyisi right”? lsthat
an evil conservative bias that is
brainwashing the minds of men?
Why can’t it be “Left" or at least
“Moderate" Guard? Is it just as evil
as table grapes?

PRETTY NEAT CAMEL
CIGARETTES. Is this a blatant
exploitationof animals? Docarnels
work in quality control at RJ.

Reynolds? Why can’t there be a
vegetable on the covcrilike a
celery stalk? Celery Lights; I like
that. Is it any more evil than Coors?

If my first Grinnell experience
consisted of contemplating soap

dishes, I thinkl wouldeither transfer
or try to get out of my freshman
double and have more meaningful
experiences.

Floor Urges Cancellation
of Krauss Column "Waste"

To the editor.

You published an article by Eric
Krauss in the last edition of the
ScarlelandBlack(SepL 7). Panof
the article dealt with the waste of
trees in some unneeded sections of
his notebook. How ironic, being
that this floor has never seen a

greater waste of trees or paper
products than his innane. rambling
and altogether pointless feature.
Please 5&8, don‘t print
anything by him ever
again....again... again."
