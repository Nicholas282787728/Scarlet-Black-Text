ing, or rather, talking about
sex. It has come to our attenr
tion also. that there is perhaps
a little too much talk and not
quite enough action.

Consider the amount at money
expended for the Sexuality Serr
ies in order to bring experts
to campus so that they can exe
plain away our qualms about
Homosexuality and Masturba-
tion.'This is all well and good,
but it does nothing ior us when
we awaken every morning and

scratch our turry palms. The

problem is that every one or

us knows as much about homoe

sexuality as they Want to and

one or the major problems on
this campus seems to be that

we know all too well what mas~

we know all too well What maSr

turbation is. NO body benefits.

As a iar more adequate solu-

tion, we suggest an alternate

three-point plan:

(3) instead o! importing “experts”
who are PhrD's, why not import

, real experts? Import Ladies and
Gentlemen oi the Evening lrom
Paris, New York and Pella to
solve our more immediate pro-
blems. When First Aid has been
administered and our llIStS are
abated the time comes to per-
manently cure this malady.

(b) We are quite sure that SGA
(getting on yet, Scott?) would
gladly sponser an All-Campus
Strip Poker Party on Central
Campus followed by a Mazola Par-
ty tor 1300 people, This will allow
the Grinnell man to get used to
the idea that Grinnell women carry
no hidden armament under their
clothing and would allow Grinnell
women to discover that Grinnell

men really have that fabled app-
aratus of which they‘ve heard so
much and seen so little.

(c) Making Norris Cerd by alter-
nating bed (de jure as well as
de lacto).

All this sounds rather mechr
anlstic, impersonal, sexist and
downright nasty. It is. We know
what we’re asking, but we hope
that students oi Grinnell, men
and women, have the guts, will
and common sense to go beyond
all this utterly ridiculous Sure

all basically searching tor, that
is, love, whatever that is. We

Watergate In,Washington‘

Chle! at Wuhlnltan Burelu
by Jim Skarzynski

WASHINGTON, DOA-Washington
is an interesting place to be these
days. On the American University
campus, as well as everywhereelse
in this city, Watergate is a topic of
continual conversation. Perhaps in-
terest in the scandal has faded in
other parts oi the county, but pub-
lic attention on this issue remains
high in the Capitol.

The excitement of the Watergate
scandal extends even to the com»
plex ltsell. lnvariably, there are
numerous tourists pointing up to-
ward the windows in the complex
attempting to determine the Iormer
location of the Democratic National
headquarters

As one gazes up at the complex
he’ can not help but relive the 5mm
mer’s testimony beiore the Ervin
committee. With no great amount
or imagination one can sense how
the plumbers broke into, the builds
ing and how shop was set up in the
Howard Johnson's across the street.

The complex is located just feet
away from the bank of the Potomac
As one looks toward the city Ii-om
this point, he can not help but view
two other prominent Washington
structuresr Directly east looms the
Washington monument. The ohelisk
towers high above the city’s skye
line.‘ln fact, a Washington build

ing ordinance prohibits the cons-
truction oi any building taller than

, twelve stories so that the domin-

ance of the monument will never be
diminished,

To the South stands the Lincoln
memorial, It is a solid, formid-
able structure dominated by an en-
ormous structure or Lincoln. He
sits in a huge chair, his eyes
gazing toward the Washington mon—
ument and Capitol Hill.

thin

In these two monuments one,sen-
ses the greatness of Washington and
Lincoln. But at the same time, an
errie feeling comes over one as
he stands looking toward these two
monuments ircm the base of the
Watergate complex. oiie not only
senses the accomplishments at two
of America's greatest presidents,
but he is also made painlully aw-
are of the [railties of politicians
and the corruption of politics, both
present and past. Then somehow
the majesty or these two monu—

Senator George McGovern spoke
on the American University campus
last Tuesday on the necessity to re-
define the goals ofAmericantoreign
policy. He said that he chose to

speak at American because it was
at this campus a decade ago that
John Kennedy pleaded for an end
to the cold war and publicly announ-
ced his plans tor a test ban treaty.

In his speech McGovern linked the
Watergate mentality to the repeated
errors oi U.S. toreign policy during
the cold war. He Stated that the
Watergate mentality was created
long before the White House plum-
bers. Rather, it was in ourobsessior
with national security at any price
that we betrayed the constitutional
principles of two hundred years.
So in the wake of Watergate, Mc-
Govern called for the reform not
only oi our domestic politics. but
also a redirection or our ioreign
policy. '

First, McGovern noted that our
iorelgn policy must concentrate on
what is vital to the nation. He urged
that our foreign policy should be the

‘servant and the master of the soc-

iety. McGovern stated that our tor-
eign policy “should includethe heal-
th or our families as much as
the size or our bombs, the safety
of our Streets as well as the env
gloss of war.”

Second, the Senator Stated that
our policy must be consistent with
our proiessed ideals—-thal our pol.
icy must emphasize America's Con-

I wish to speak or. It is the qllESr

individual rights of decision can be
iorteited Too often, the issue was
explained as, "but this is a good
cause, so individual rights don’t
matter.” This is my ‘point. Quite
a bit of the bad done in the world
is done with the best oi lntenslons.
This is something liberals seem in-
capable of understanding.

Persons advocating censorship do
it out oi'vthe best of moral intensions.
Persons raving about the need to
stop protest really believethat their
cause is good. The point not being
made very well here is that when
one sees individual rights as being
on a sliding scale that can be moved
all over the place depending on the
relative good or bad oi the issue,
he interjects a value judgement into
the equation. Assume that the let—

KLAGENFUHT, AUSTRIA»-lt’s li-
ttle things you miss that really be-
gin to make an impression on you
while studying abroad, Take me tor
instance. While living in Viennathis
summer, I developed an “icebox
syndrome" after thirsting in vain
Icr something typical like iced tea.
All you could do was ask for water
it you were really thirsty, but then
be treated as an oddity, because
you didn’t order the usual semie
warm beer or wine. I really wone
dered how people quenched their
thirst. it certainly Wasn't by any
of my standards, and since I could
not live under theirs, i kept order-
ing the water which then usually
came.

in all iairness, I must explain
that the Austrian refrigerator is

. model. They simply don’t have the

room to store the food we retrig~
crate Without a second thoughtr As
a result, some of the most amaze
ing things get bumped outside with
the salt and pepper.

One excerpt from the icebox is
butter. Here people leave the but
ter dish out constantly, but the
dish is usually a low—slung covere
ed jar affair. However, Austrians
like their butter soft for easy sp~
reading on the traditional hard brr

eaklasl rolls and supper sandwich
loaves, and seem to use it at a

taster rate than it spoils,

Another noticeable deletion is eggs.
This practice was easy to spot,
particularly in the grilled—chicken
shapes that are interspersed th»
roughout Vienna. At these stores
you can buy everything a live chi»
cken has to offer, including its
head and teet, so eggs are a nae
hiral sideline. They usually line the
baCk Shelves, sitting on the bottom
hali oi egg cartons. And they don’t
seem to mind the heat from-the
rotisserie ovens and hatch into
something less than edible.

It’s easy to extend the list oi

the proponents or supporters at
the lettuce boycott as decided onthis
campus, icel it the student body
committed a political act you dise
liked? Suppose the campus had Voted
last tall to give the entire special
events fund to the Nixon re-election
campaign? Is that so very much
dinerent from the act committed
by a lorced boycott of lettuce?

The obvious solution is that no
one should make political or moral
judgements (or anyone else. Every-
one should have the right ot'perr
sonal action. Whether the issue in
conﬂict is ”good" or ”bad," in-
dividual rights should remain. A let
tuce boycott may be a noble thing,
but where is the nobility oi ioroing
someone else to boycott lettuce wh-
ether he Wishes to or not? Should
anyone who voted to lorce others to
boycott lettuce‘ever speak of in-
dividual rights again, maythe words
choke in their throats. You cannot
protest against something which is
happening to you, when you, your-
seli have done it to others. Cer»
tainly the social utility of each
issue changes, but shouldn’t the
standard of freedom of expression
remain?

What I took the long way at doing
was to call a majority oi students
on this campus hypocrites. You
scream like mad when someone
deprives you or liberties, but should
the call of social consciousness
be heard, you are more than ready
to throw any notion of Civil lib-
erties in the dirt,

The old dinosaur of Civil liber-
ties, may, as Carmichael stated,
give way to humane socialism. Ii
that is to be history, so be it.
But shouldn't one last gasp be heard
tor this philosophy. When humane
socialism decides that (or the good
of society, you must be eliminated,
perhaps that reactionary idea or
individual rights won’t seem sobad.
Anyway, welcome to the brave new

a cool drink is deilned as anything

worse is that certain prejudices
have crept into the Austrian men-
tality to justity the lack or ice
cubes beyond the space limitation
argument. For example, colddrinks
are considered unhealthy and are
blamed as the source of numerous
ailments ranging trom upset stoma
achs to hoarse throats. They also
