: SGA budget
,. changes pass

by Elaine lisllbililgll

A new, alternate SGA budget
proposal was put beiore the Joint
boards Wednesday night and was
passed unamimously. The budget
proposal will require passage oi a
constitutional amendment, which
\iill be voted on by an allecalnpus
referendum.

According to the proposed
amendment, the new SGA
president, viee»presldent, and
Joint Board members will assume

jaaties of oiiice after graduation
exercises, in the spring. The period
between election and graduation
will be the “internship” period, in
which the new cabinets and the old

tabinets will work together.

V Incoming executive officers will
work in conjuction with the
outgoing cabinet and the outgoing
Joint Board on budget formulation.
The outgoing Joint Board will vote
on the budget for the following year
and the budget will be flexible
inselar as any necessary changes
could be made up until thirty'days
into the semester. According to a
tentative calendar tor budgetary

‘planning, discussion on April 23

trill lead to decision by tile Joint
Board on a final budget.

There was some discussion.
Mark Nissen, SGA treasurer, said

What the assumption of office by

.' oint Board members should take
lace around the first of May, with
the budget still ﬁnished by the end
of April. He argued that alter
commencement was “a late lime
to be getting Joint Boards
together." However, Rick DiBello,
representative of Dibble Hall,
voiced the general opinion that
these early assumptions of official
duty would “help bring about
continuity between SGA govern.
ments” and make the budgetary

Qrocess a whole lot simpler."
Commenting that SGA does need at
least a skeleton staff during the

fummer months, Will Collins, SGA

While the 1974775 Grinnell Book.
the college yearbook, is scheduled
for delivery after winter break, the
plight of the 1975-76 edition is unr
certain. John Lom, former ad-
vertising manager of the Scarlet

,and Black. and sports editor of the

ﬁearbook, has been appointed
editor to fill the vacancy created
by Marvin Barnes’ recent
resignation, The positions oi
assistant editor and layout editor,

-’also open becuase of recent

. reSlgnations, have not yet been
ﬁlled. The staff will continue
working despite the uncertainty of
publication. »

Gordon Brown (editor of the
Grinnell Magazine) and Brent
Schondelmeyer, members of the
Student Publications and Radio
Committee, were not prepared to

’ ‘ discuss the diriicuities of the 153747

president, pressed lor the final
passage of the amendments

Following this discussion a vote ‘

was taken. The amendments
passed with no nayes and only one
abstention.

Other questions handled by SGA
at this November 12 meeting in-
cluded the need for $250 to be
provided for the November 15 all~
campus 'su‘s dance ln Darby, the
continuance of publication of the
Grapevine, and the request by
Warren Eastman for 840073500 to
help fund the Grinnell Verbal
Activities Club. The $250 provision
for the party passed, but not
without numerous abstentions and
“no” votes.

The decision was made to go
ahead with Grapevine plans by
making up the normal form of
questionaire to be filled out by
Students, Without at least a 50 per
cent student response, however,
Will Collins stated that the
Grapevine would not appear. Also,
extensive investigation into
changes in student opinion of the
worth of the Grapevine and look
into possible changes in its format
will occur in the upcoming weeks.
The G-VAc funding question,
although brought up in discussion,
was not decided upon. A definite
vote on this question is expected to
come up in the very near future,
but no money is expected to be
forthcoming since the club has
already received $800 from the
administration. '

This week the “Scarlet and
Black" presents a three-page
special on Women at Grinnell.

Socialists VQuiun Bristeu and Ted Gliek discuss their Slightly different views at a Third World Group spon-

sored conference.

Socialists air views

by Tom Pnliteu to
Dennis Hansen

Monday and Tuesday, members
of the New Left appeared in South
Lounge. Specifically they
presented the views of Socialism in
America. The‘lectures were
sponsored by the Third World
Organization.

Monday night Ted Glick,
spokesman of the National Interim
Committee for the Mass Movement
of the People. and former Grinnell
student, spoke on the history of the
socialist movement in the United
States. Beginning with soc' l
reform movements after the Civil
War the socialist movement
emerged as a separate entity in
1902 and 1903. However, because of
internal conilicts and government
oppression, the Party degenerated
to a shell by 1920. With the rapid
rise in labor unions in the 1930’s
and 1940’s came new strength ior
leftist organizations, including
socialist parties, Socialist
movements again lost vigor during

The current staff must answer
many questions currently up in the
air and also learn from last year’s
experience. Presently they are
looking into a different printing
arrangement. In the future they
must reconcile they type of book
they would like to publish and the
amount or tunds they have. A
decision may be made to return to
a soft-cover book rather than the
upcoming hardback edition.

Brown remarked, “Somewhere
there is a yearbook for Grinnell
College." it will most certainly be
a compromise between what the
students and staff want and what
resources will permit. The Student
Publications and Radio Committee
would appreciate any feedback
from students concerning the
college yearbook.

the Cold War period and McCarthy
persecutions.

With the Civil Rights movement
in the 1960‘s came the beginnings of
the New Left. White college
students became principal
characters in the drive against
racism. However, 1965, was the
watershed for the white student
movements when it was decided
that too many whites and too few
blacks were involved in the fight.
Therefore the displaced whites
focused their attention on the
Vietnam War, in which the US,
was becoming more involved.
Through 1968 the antiewar groups
grew, especially the SDS (Students
for a Democratic Society). After
1968, Glick felt that the student
movement began the disintegrate.
They began going “crazy” because
there were no traditions of the past
to lean on. By 1970-71 the left
movement had lost much of its
mass character,

Click and others today are
striving to create a massbased
socialist party “to take back the
country" irom leaders they con-
sider minority capitalists. Glick
said there are three factions
strivingicr this goal. There are the
communist parties tied to RUSSia,
the communist parties affiliated
with China, and the parties like
Glick’s which are building from the
culture and experiences of
America.

For success Glick feels that a
socialist ideology must be
established, that the group must
maintain an open “up-front"
relationship with the public. and
that the movement become
oriented toward the working class
and not just toward the white elitist
class. Right now Click is con-
cerned more about quality than
quantity in the socialist movement.
He said, “with committed people
the party will last until the country
realizes the need for a new socialist
government. Americans will
realize this need as have people the

world over}? . ‘
The topic of Tuesday evening 5

panel discussion was “Socialism
and the Electoral Process."
Socialist Party Vice Presidential
candidate Quinn Bristen and Glick
discussed the viability of elections
in bringing social change and other
issues,

Bristen stated that although he
believes he has little chance of
winning, his candidacy is a means
of drawing an audience to hear his
views. The two major reasons he is
campaigning tor the Vice-
Presidency are: (1) he believes in
the Control of the means of
production by the producers
themselves and (2) he wants to put
the Socialist alternative before the
American people.

Speaking of the role of the elec—
toral process as viewed by
Socialists. Bristen said. ”i do .
think that if socialism is to be
brought to this country it must be
done by a majority of the people. I
don’t believe I Can impose
socialism on the American
people.“ He added that he believes
that as long as electoral politics
exists socialists are bound to use
them before they try other means
or revolutionary change."

Glick outlined five principles
upon which his ideals of socialism
are based. The first is a com-
mittment to reVolution. Second is
the necessity of temporarily in-
stituting a dictatorship of the
proletariat. Third, socialism
means an extension or democracy
giving all the people the power to
make decisions for the society.
This would include democratic
election of leaders, provisions for
their immediate recall, and paying
leaders no more than is received
by the average worker. Glick's
iourth point was the necessity for
socialists to be always striving
toward the ultimate classless
society. Finally, Gliek said all
means of taking power must be
fully utilized. Elections can be used
as part of the struggle, he ex-
plained, but the ultimate victory
will probably come through other
