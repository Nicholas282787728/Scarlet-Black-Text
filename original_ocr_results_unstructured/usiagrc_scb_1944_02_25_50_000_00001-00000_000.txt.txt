“The War Department con-

this moment in force until
further notice."

This statement was made yes-
ter day by Dr. Stuart G. Brown.
educational director for A. s. T
unit 4770, in an attempt to clari-
fy the position in which this col»
lege is left following the almoulle
ced withdrawal of language and
area and engineering students ef-
fective March 4.

According to him, the with
drawal of 110.000 soldiers from A.
S. T. units throughout the coun-.
try in no way effects the existr
ancc or organization of the pro-
gram itsclf. It is part of a major.

The local A s. T. unit may
be revived or i'eplncsl at any
time within the duration of the
present army contract. What
kind of a unit would make such
a replacement is not known.
though the question is now under
discussion by the war depart-
ment. A rehabilitation educational
unit is among those being consldr
cred. he added.

Further light was thrown on
the local situation by Dr. Samuel

A. s. T, Pintact, implying in his
opinion. the reactivation or put

Il'ang’elﬂel‘lts for the fourth Gl'innell college nominating con-

vention were announced. Indications are that campaigning

Spirit will suffer no letdown,

despite the snlehl enrollment

and the predominantly feminine appearance of the com-

petition.

With indications of an almost
exclusively female student body
iicxt year. the preliminary selec-
tion of candidates for the student
will be from
a list of eligible juniois on which
women have a 43 to l advantage

The list. released last night by
Marilyn McCool. piesciit student

of only one man. Dan Doolittle.
Macy junior {lam Des Moines.

Opinion expressed by the gon-
ei-al student body indicates a
feeling that a woman president
would offer a more fair consider-
ation of the problems of student
government next year. which will
necessarily be centered in the
quadranglc.

From the list of eligibles. four
women appear as obvious candi
dates. with several other ‘da
horse' possibilities.

Certain to command a substan-
tial following is
Haiiies junior from Council
Bluffs. Miss Ross has been one
of the most active members of
the council for the past two
years, accumulating a thorough
knowledge of the problems aiic
policies of student government in

here in student activities in ad

She was u candidate for junior

cently at a Gadahout dance.

Janet Pearce. also of names,

. Doolittle is definitely not out
of the running. if a swing back
