In response to Dan Buett—
net’s “In the Coffee .7” October
6th, 1995

To the Editor:

Well, I’m back after my first Fall
Break,nner,Buettnershould know
that l rook his advice.

1 have decided to break off the
engagementtothe boyfriendar home.

I have decided to stop posting
myACT,A.P,,SAT, (and,yes, even
myPSAT)scoresoutsldemydoorfor
everyone to see.

1 have decided to do something
about ALL that weight I‘ve gained
and go to the PEG for three hours
everyday.

I have definitely decided to stop
giggling uncontrollably every time
someone says the word “boy.” It was
getting awfully out ofhand.

And I am going to control my
homesick urges by refusing to main—
tain any sort ofcommunication with
my family at home.

Thank you. Dan Buertner,

There is truth in what you said:
the transition from high school to
college is a dramatic one, and the
first visit home after that transition
reveals many changes that have oc—
curred for first—year students. How»
ever, your attitude disgusts me. You
say that you hope first—years will
“ leave high school and all of its atti—
tudes and behaViotisrns behind them
when they return." Obviously you
are still having problems with this
yourself. Your stereotypes of first—
years and blatant insensitiVity charr

Commentary ' 9

acterize “high school" behavior more
than any first—year I know.

For the two months I have been
athnnell,everythingl’ve observed
focuses on building community and
understanding within the student
body. In one article you manage to
effectively negate all of this by sin»
gling out the first—years as a distinct
group of immature students. If our
attitudes and homesickness bother
you, try using your experiences from
last year to show understanding and
guidance instead ofstereotyping and
belittling the whole class of 1999 in
our school newspaper.

Through reading your column.
though, 1 realized I am guilty ofdoing
the same sottofstereotyping you did:
until I read your views, I assumed all
Orinnellians kept open minds and
attempted to be understanding of
one another,

GCCS Hates You?
To the Editor:

This letter goes out to whoever
scrawled “GCCS Hates you" in the
sidewalk between the Science Build—
ingand the Forum. Getaclue. lam
one of the first people to push for
change in campus computing. but
this action is entirely uncalled for.
ThepeopleatGrinnellCollegeCom-
puter Sen/ices are conscientious,
hard—working, dedicated and certain-
ly do not deserve such criticism.

As last week's SGA minutes
point out, GCCS is horribly under—
staffed. People there want to im—
prove campus computing as much as
anyone but are held back by time and
budget constraints. Constructively
push for more funding and personnel
instead of destructively criticizing
something you obvrously do not know
very much about.

sincerely,
Evan Schnell '98

Thanks for the Hard Work

I would like to thank all of the
Cowles and Quad workers who were
here in Crinnell over Fall Break, and
worked so hard at Quad. 1 really

appreciate it. .
Thanks,

Political Participation

To the editor:

Public service and civic partici»
pation have been the Subject of a
number of recent lectures on cam»
pus, and are being widely discussed
throughout the nation, Voter par
ticipution in elections is low: people
are quite cynical about the political
process. However, it is important
that we. as students, recognize the

importance of our participation in
our democracy.

In a recent speech in Iowa at—
tended by a number of Grinnellians,
President Clinton called for students
to stand up and let Congress know
how we feel about cuts to student aid,
environmental programs, and other
public services. He has shown that
he does truly care about these issues,
and has fought hard against the Re—
publican Congress to preserve stu<
dent aid. Americorps. and many oth—
er such programs. As students, we
need to do our part, and exercise our
Constitutional rights to vote and
participate in the public debate.

Jonathan Wilson, former mem—
ber of the Des Moines School Board,
who was defeated shortly after pub—
licly coming out as a homosexual,
recently spoke on campus, and at«
tributed his election defeat by ex-
treme conservatives to their ho—
mophobic scare tactics. He warned
of the many similarities between the
United States today and Germany
during the early 1930's. We cannot
sit idly by and let our nation fall apart
at the hands of bigots who do not
care about the very people they sup»
posedly represent.

An opportunity to make a real
difference is in the Des Moines may—
oral race. The same right—wing coa—
lition which defeatedjonathan Wile
son in his race for the school board
(with an advocate of school prayer
who wants to teach Creationism in
public schools) is now at work trying
to elect a like—minded mayor and
council for the city of Des Moines,
Arthur DaVis, the moderare to liber—
al Democratic candidate, needs our
help, Groups of students will be
traveling to Des Moines to work on
the campaign each day starting on
Friday. November 3rd, and running
through election day, Tuesday. No—
vember 7th, If you can contribute a
few hours of time any of those days,
please help out. You may VAX ei-
ther Thad Murphy [MURPHYT] or
Jeff Lake [LAKE] for details or to sign
up.

Both Wilson and Clinton have
called for our participation in the
political process, and particularly
have encouraged us to Vote. in the
next two to three weeks, there will be
a campus wide voter registration
drive. Students will be coming
around the dorms with voter regis<
tration cards to allow you to register
to vote. If you are registered at home,
then you need to send in for your
absentee ballots now for your local
elections. In short, we all must do
our part, and we can start by voting.

Again, we urge you to involve
yourself in the political process at
this most critical time in American
politics.
