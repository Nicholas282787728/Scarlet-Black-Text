What Should Wally Do? Reporter
F ind-s Faculty Women’s Ideas Vary

Random Interviews Show
Majority Think King
Should Decide

Br Eloise shinny

True love or a ihl‘olleiwl’llch is
more important7 That question,
tacing Wally Simpson
would be solved in many different
ways if Gl‘lnnell faculty women
were in hcr place. Each or them
has her own way of handling the
Wally-Edward situation now cori-
frontiiig England.

The general consensus of opinion
of the women seems to be that
Wally has done well by herself.
They believe the solution is now
up to the king. They especially
approved of her latest move, her
offer to renounce the king for the
sake of the kingdom.

Come Back to ariuiicll

“I'm glad I’m not in her shoes,"
laughed Miss Amy E, Blagg, as—
sistant professor of zoology, when
an inquiring reporter asked her-
what she would do if she were
Wally Simpson "If I were Wally,
I’d come hack to Grinnell and
stick to my frogs, Teaching school

, is easier than keeping house”

Optimistic Miss Marietta Kettur
nen. instructor in art, said, “I’d
get my divorce and marry the
king, and get another divorce and
some more publicity when. I tired
or him. Then I'd be sure of con-
stant alimony."

Not to Ruin me

“But I wouldn't let it ruin my
lite if he did give me up,” Miss
Clara Julia Andersen, director or
physical education for women, as-
serted. “I think I’d just go away
and leave it up to him, knowing
that his decision would be the

' most satisfactory to us both."

Mrs. Jessie Ware, hostess in
Haines cottage, was more hard-
heartea about it. “If King Edward
would make me his queen, all
right; but I Wouldn’t he anybody’s
morganatic Wife."

Not Sell»siicriticlug

The selfsacriiicing element was
not predominant. However, Miss
Helen Reisinger. secretary of the
dean of women, after first shyly
hesitating to state an opinion, said,
“I would give him up and go some
place to forget it all. One must
remember that he isaking bee
fore he is a man, even though he
