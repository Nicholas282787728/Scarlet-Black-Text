Four’reen Less
Than in I939

However, Percentage
Employed Is Better
Than in Last June

Sixty one seniors have made
plans and l‘ecelved jobs fOI‘
next year, it was announced
recently by Miss Phyllis WI.
Tod, secretary of the appoint.
ment bureau.

Of this number, 12 Will be-
come teachers and 11 salesmen.
other occupations listed by the
outgoing class are journalism, ace
counting work, secretarial work,
personnel work, graduate school
and marriage.

14 Less Than Last Year.

Although the number is 14 less
than last year, when 75 an-
nounced plans for next year, this
year’s class is considerably smal»
ler, and the percentage of those
who have jobs, therefore, is
somewhat higher than last year's
graduating class.

The complete list of seniors 3L
ready lined up for next year is:

Carl J. Atkins, banking trade
journal, Commercial West Minnee
apolis, Minn.- Margaret Bates,
teaching music, Neu-burg high
school; James Beiscnstein, certi-
ried public accountant, Ernst
and Ernst, Chicago; Russell Berg,
newspaper work, Chicago Daily

sistaiitship, Western Reserve 'uxiis
verity, Cleveland, Ohio.

uate work School of Library

teaching

fine highway signs advertising
the college, as well as the
town of Grinnell that were
recently put up by the Cham-
ber of Commerce.

I have long wished that
such signs might he put up
calling attention to the advan-
tages of Grinncll, and I am
sure that the initiative of the
Chamber of Commerce in this
matter will bear good fruit.
This is no reason why Grin-
nell should hide her light un-
der a bushel. I know at no
place anywhere which is a
more desirable place of resie

dance or which offers more
cultural opportunitics than

Grinncll, and it is well that
the wider piihlic should become
better inloi-med about the
great advantages that Grinnell
has to offEI' as a place of
residence,
