Diversity is the American reality GrOWng Class POIEII‘iZEJ‘LtiOn
destabilizes American cities

By Alison Wade

For Cecilia Silva, the issue of the
minorityisnotaboutmulticultutalism
per se.

“Wherever you go," said Silva,
“the issue of the minority has to be
raised, not because it‘s politically
correct, but becauseit’s there. It‘s the
reality.”

Silva, a political science major
from El Paso, Texas, is currently
working with the Des Moines His»
panic Ministry, a non-proﬁt service
organization established to aid the
Latino/Latina community of central
Iowa. The work is not easy.

“It is nota glamorousjob-- I don’t
work with glamorous people," Silva
said. Most people seeking the Minis-
try services "are undocumented imr
migrants, transients, and workers
Many live scattered throughout the
city, in apartment complexes, shel-
ters, behind and within abandoned
buildings. They usually do not speak
the English language, are pennilcss
and just plain scared."

To these clients. the Ministry pro-
vides food, contact information, re-
ferrals, interpretive services and aids
in general understanding of the logis»
tics and legalities of immigration.
Becauserhe staffislimited. theduties
of individual workers are varied. and
Silva hasaidulin damentry,interpre-
ration, food distribution and consul-
tation of different clients.

The Des Moines Hispanic Minis-
try is the only agency in central Iowa
that does this type of work. despite
the fact that the Latino/Latina com-
munity in this area has been growing.
This growth,rcflected everywhere in
the country, is pan of what makes
consideration of the Latino/Latina
situation so important.

”There are 22 million Latinos in
this country who are here to stay.
That’s the reality," said Silva. There
fore Latino/Latina issues “are very
tiedinwiththecountryasawhole. As
members of this society, people have
to be aware of these issues."

Silva has worked with different
Latino organizations in the past, and
has learned there are great regional
differences in Latino/Latina issues.

“In El Page the work I did was
focused on the plight of the undocu-
mented immigrant," she said. There,
she did much traveling to the areas of
high illegal border traffic to discuss
with immigrants the abuse they re-
ceived from borderrpatrols and oth-
ers. Here in Iowa, however, sheclaims
that Latinos/Latinas are largely “free
from the harassment that they’d face
in El Pasol"

Silva‘s work with these organiza4
tions is inspired by her background.
A first generation Mexican-Ameri-
can, she grew up in a Latino/Latina
community. and went toahighschool
thatwas 97% Mexican-American. Her
education at Grinnell has provided
her the opportunity to examine the
situation of her people from a dis—
IBDCEt

“This college prepares you to
be. .. globally aware,“ she asserts, “but
my education took a different turn
from most as a result of my back
groundand the things I'd seen." Silva

For Grinnell student and first generation Mexican, American
Cecilia Silva, minority issues aren‘t P.C.; they are the reality

considers herself lucky that she was
granted this opportunity at alll

“I’m one who didn’t fall through
the cracks,butthe cracks are very big,
and my not falling through means
only that I was fortunate."

Silva believes one of the greatest
threats to the Latino/Latina commu-
nity is the fact that so many children
dofall through theeducational cracks.
She referred to the50% Latino/Latina
high school dropout rate and states,
“It scares the shit outof me. Isee the
numbers, I see the children. and I
wonder what can be done? What’s
going to happen to us?"

As arcsult, one ofhcr main targets
in Latino/Latina issues is Ihtttofedu-
cationt She feels that many Latino/
Latina children are filled with cxr
trcmc anger towards their situation,
and “desperately need somebody to
say that it won’talways be lrkc this.”

Much of Silva's goal is to “help
children realizsthe powers they carry
withinthemselvesaslegitimatemem—
bers of this society, so that they don‘t
have to resort to an abandonment of
the values of Latino people." Silva‘s
work with the Ministry has inspired
her to remain in Iowa following her
graduation in December and to con-
tinue working with the Latino/Latina
community here.

”Po me, personal success is very
much linked to the success of the
community,” she said. “It’s time to
assert our presence. and assert it po»
litically. Our greatest hope lies in our
numbers and unity, and because of
this, our issues are important."

“This has nothing to do with
multiculturalism [as a philosophy],"
Silva said. Rather. it is that“the rom-
muniry is very, very large and grow-
ing, And we're here to stay."

Growing class distinctions in
American cities is a topic of increas-
ing concern according to Arnold
Fleishman. associate professor of
political science at the University of
Georgia. Fleishman spoke at Grin-
nell last Friday on the topic “Wel-
come to the Third World: The line
pending Crisis of American Stares
and Communities."

Fleishman noted that suburban
areas of large cities were growing in
populationandbecomingincreasingly
middle class. The middle class were
moving completely out of the urban
sectors, leaving behind only thevery
rich and the very poor-a polarity
which creates a problem similar to
that found in thirdeworld cities such
as Mexico City or Rio de Janiero
which have high crime rates and se-
vere economic problems.

Class polarities in urban areas also
heighten racial and ethnic tensions
since many of the poor come from
minority groups. Thehigh concentra—
tion of the lower class also makes it
more difﬁcult for the poor to better
their lot by obtaining entry level jobs.
since most large companies do not
want their corporations in the poorer
parts of town. The poor remain poor.

Local governments often contrib—
ute to the problem by constructing
high-priced housing in more afﬂuent
areas that encourage the super rich

and discourage both the poor and the
middle class who can no longer at»
ford to live there. This further widens
the class distinctions.

There is also a ﬁerce competition
among local and state governments
trying to lure majorcorporatiorrs into
their areas. A local government will
not propose sites for corporations in
poorer parts of the city for fear the
company will find those sites unat-
tractive and wish to move to a differ-
ent city or area, causing the city to
losepotential jobs and local programs
provided by the corporation. How-
ever, Fleishman pointed out that
sometimes corporations can improve
local demographics by revitalizing
an area

School districts often contribute
to the problem by competing for “3L
ﬂuentwhitekids." This processcauses
racial and class segregation in the
schools, so thewealthy and poverty-
sm'cken of the cities cannot be inte-
grated in the clasnooms. Fleishman
believes the state should set up the
boundaries for school districts, rather
than the school districts themselves,
to make them more equitable

Fleishman argued that unless those
problems are solved soon. the major
cities of the United States may be
reduced toconcentrations of thepoor—
- a result that would lead to the eco-
nomic deterioration of lirose cities
and ultimately the entire country

 

Iowa City events affect Asian students at Grinnell

By Chris Maag

The November lst shooting ram-
page cf University of Iowa physics
studentGangLu,wholdllcd five cam-
pus members. including himself, has
shocked the nation.

Lu,originallyfrom Beijing,China,
apparently began the spree because
an academic award he wantcd was
given to another physics student,
Linhua Shari, also a Chinese student
at the university. Two weeks later,
the university still mounts the loss of
these faculty members and students.

Beyond the Iowa City campus,
there remains somewhat of a contr0<
versy over the nature of the Chinese
students involved andthestereotypes

that may follow.

“Yeah, I‘ve overheard things like,
‘Oh, that's just the way Chinesepeople
dcalwith thingsithey’reoverlycom—
petitive when it comes to school and
work."'said Kun-hongLu,aGrinnell
studentfrom China. “I disagree. Chi-
nese are raughttobesilent and sortof
accepting r I thirtk it was a very
American reaction."

Several Asianstudents stressed the
same idea, that this was an isolated
incident of one disturbed person who
happened to be from China. and that
it was not representative of Chinese
students as a whole

“There’s a fear that people are
going to feel that Chinese students
are arisk because, you lorow, this guy

was an A student and seemed pretiy
normal ,” said the only Chinese phys—
ics student at Grinnell, who didn’t
want his name printed. “Chinese
people take it very seriously because
this really isn‘t normal."

It is too soon to tell whether the
shootings will have any effect on the
admissions process of colleges and
universities. The only apparent
changes on the Grinnell campus have
been relatively small, such as physics
students jokingly expecting to get
better grades this semester.

As for true social reaction, Kun»
hong Lu said. “There have been a lot
of little comments. but I really don‘t
think people's ideas of Chinese stu-
dents will change at all"

How do you feel Grinnell is living up to its claim as a diverse liberal arts college?

L .A‘

Payal Chrtlangia
“Grinnell does have its diver~
sity, yet there are still a few
Americans who cannot com—
fonablyaeceptintemationalstu-
deals I feel that simply be—
cause I come from a different
background does not mean that
we cannot talk."

Aaron Wiener
“I think that Grinnell is making
an honest attempt at multie
culturalism withsome success.
Its shortcomings are probably
the same as the American edu-
cational system as a whole.

Vikram Subramaniam

“I don’tsee Grinnell completely
living up to the billing as a di-
verse college. I ﬁnd that com-
ing from a conservative back-
ground it is difﬁcult to express
my opinions openly without
being chastised.”

Melinda Pettigrew
“I think we do have a diversity
of students. but I don't think
that necessarily meansthat there
is a lot of interaction between
the groups."
