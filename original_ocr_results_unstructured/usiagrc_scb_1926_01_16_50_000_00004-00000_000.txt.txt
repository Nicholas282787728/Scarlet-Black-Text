SEVERAL'EHANGES MADE
IN BASEBALL RULES

Games Will Not be Cllllllgcll but Slight
Cllnllges A , Expected to Speed
It Up Considcrohly.

Several important changes in bas-
ketball rules for the coming season
are contained in the 1926 rules. Air
though the alterations will not radr
ically change the game, the new rul—
ings and interpretations should speed
up the game.

Outstanding among the changes in
the playing code are those abolishing
the hand behind the back on the jump
ball, and the doing away with the goal
zone. Under the new jump rule, it
is a personal foul for a player to in.
terfere in any way with his opponent,
and this has special reference to the
hand not used in tapping the hall. To
avoid this, players must attempt to
keep the hand in the plane of the
body. '

The detailed changes in the rules
follow: ‘ 131%

The goal zones are abolished. The
free throw lines are the parts of the
old zone lines within the circles.

The face of the backboard must he
painted white,

Players of the same team shall not
wear duplicate numbers.

The referee shall not permit any
player to wear braces, etc.. which are
dangerous to others.

The referee may disqualify players
(or flagrant unsportsmanship,

The umpire shall keep the scorers
informed upon decisions made by the
referee and umpire.

The score hook of the home team
shall he the official book unless the
referee rules otherwise.

The edges of the backboard are in

hounds; that is, if the ball strikes the_

edge of the backboard and rebounds
to the court, it continues in play.

A player may pivot after a legal
dribble.

After a free throw following a
technical fool, the ball shall he thrown
on at center, whether the free throw
is made or missed. '

The hand-behiudriherbaok require-
ment on jump ball is abolished. If a
player leaves the circle be»
fore the hall is tapped, a
technical foul shall be called.
A new section is inserted under
Tor a player to interfere in any way
with an opponent when the hall is
tossed up between them, On a jump
hall, the official is to blow his whistle
when the ball leaves the hand but the
ball must not he tapped before it has
reached its highest point,

Rule 10, section 1, has been rewrit-
ten and a suggestion to officials adds
ed stressing the importance or clear
decisions of out-of-bound plays.

Doflilig, had what might have been
a serious accident at Kansas U.
Thursday night. He plays with glass-
es and they were broken in play. He
went to the floor holding his hands
to his eyes when he collided with a
Kansas player. The crowd was tense
but after an examination it was found
that his eyes were uninjured, It was
necessary to sweep up the glass be-
for the play could be resumed.

The Daily Kansnn remarks that
referee E. C. Quigley almost made an
error in the Grinnell-Kansas game.
After Kansas committed it foul Grin-
nell took two tries for the goal and
time out was called. When play was
resumed ingley put the ball on Grin—
nell's free line as i! he intended to
give the Pioneers another shot. Kan-
sas reminded him of his mistake, how»
ever. It is not often thattbey get
anything on Quigloy. Whether it is in
big league baseball, football or bass
kethall, without doubt Quigley can be
called the greatest sport's official in
the country. Eckcrsall might differ
with that statement but he would not
have many backers.

"Doc" Huff has some good track
material out but he does not have
enough. There is it good many men
with ability Who would have it good
chance to do something under "Doc’s"
tutelage if they would get out and
work. Grinnell track men never have
been accused of being lilzy and this is
no year to begin, for it will take some
extra effort to make up for the loss
of Taylor and the other men who help-
ed make up last year's strong team.

perform elsewhere. In the recent
boxing match with the Kansas Aggies
he knocked out Pearson, Aggie hefty/yr

first round. Cory weighed in at 175

last fall, at 193.
