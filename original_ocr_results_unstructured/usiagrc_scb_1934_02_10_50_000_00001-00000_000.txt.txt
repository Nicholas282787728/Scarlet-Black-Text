Bulldogs Nip
Pioneer Five

for 25-24 Win

Grinnell Misses Nine Tries
from Free Throw Line

to Lose Game

Seven minutes of scoreless play on
the part of Grinnell last night at the
start of the second half, wiped out
the 17-9 lead built up by the Pionee -<
in the opening period of their tilt
with Drake and allowed the Bulldogs
to emerge with a heartbreaking 25-
24 victory.

As a result of the loss. Drake re-
places Grinnell in the tie with Creigh.
ton and Washington for runnel'rup
position in the Missouri Valley con»
ference race.

Failed on Free Throws

Inability to score on free throws
was mainly responsible for the Pio-
neers’ defeat. Manns was the only
Gr-inoellian to score on a gratis toss.
He sank the only two free throws
which the locals caged in 11 at-
tempts. Though outscored 11 to 9 on
baskets. Drake made 7 out of
10 foul shots to obtain its one point
margin of victory,

The Bulldogs jumped into an early
lead and the Pioneers were trailing
9 to a when they began their scoring
spree. Mason and Bauer were the big
guns in the Grinnell drive. Each
tossed in three goals. Olipliant and
Manns also contributed to the rally
with three and two points respective-
ly.

Drake Defense Clicked
. As the gun ended the half, Grinnell
" seemed headed for certain victory.
However, when the teams returned
to the floor. the Drake defense be-
gan to click and the Grinnellians’ of-
fense had lost its effectiveness. Drake
gradually overhauled the leaders. A
long onerhanded shot by Abram
evened the count at 17 all, and a toss

Machado, Thomas,

by Freshmen as

Fresh Orientation Papers
Make Many Startling

Revelations

Is Norman Thomas Iowa’s U, S.
senator? Did Moses build the ark? ls
Machado the emperor of Japan? Is
Henry Mencken a maker of shaving
creams.7 1s Manchoukuo the ruler of
Japan?

Some freshman member-s of Dean
Shelton L. Beatty's orientation class
for men evidently think so. according
to the results of a recent examina-
tion. But these “boners" are not no»
usual in the answers of large groups
to similar questions. Mr Beatty says,
“Failure to know these matters is not
a rarity among many people."

Thoiiins Versatile.

Included among the men and terms
which the orientation class was aslc
ed to identify were the following:
Machada. Walter Lippman. Moses.
Manchoukuo. Henry Mencken, Nor-l
man Thomas, Mussolini. Hitler. L. E.
Lawes. Hugh Johnson. Ramsay Mace
Donald. cephalic index. and glacial
age. ‘

Norman Thomas, former Socialistl
candidate for president, appeared the
most versatile of the group. being
listcd as Roosevelt’s ambassador at
large. a national representative of
England. Iowa's U. S. senator. an‘
English sportsman. and a iicwspapor‘,
and radio “flasher."

“Sclminr” Machiido

 

Machado. Cuban err-president. was

 

MacDonald Listed

Iowa Congressmen

confused several times with the mike
ado. ruler of Japan. He was also list-
ed as king of Italy, U. S. senator
from Iowa. and u. S. representative
from Iowa. The name of Walter
Lippman. American author and jour-
nalist. was also confused with those
of other men. He was identified as a
famous former American poet Walt
Whitman), a famous English sports-

‘mali (sir Thomas Lipton). and as an

English statcman.

Moses. Hebrew leader and law-giv-
er who called forth water from a
rock by striking it with his rod, was
confused with Noah as the builder of
the “arc”. He was also listed as a
follower of Christ. Ramsay Mac-
Donald, prime minister of Great
Britain, joined the ranks along with
Machado and Norman Thomas as
Iowa's U. S. senator. while Hitler
was identified as dictator of France
instead of Germany.

“Glacial Thinking."

General Hugh Johnson is “secre-
tary of state. and important in the
NRA." according to one answer. and
Warden L E Lewes of Sing Sing
prison is also listed as being Ilnporr
tant in the NRA. Manchoukuo, Ja-
pan's newly-created puppet state in
Mancliiiria. gained recognition as the

“'ruler of Japan "

Definitions of terms fared somer
what better. However. the cephalic
index is the ratio of certain skull
measurements to one another not
“a way of measuring rocks,” as one
student suggcsted. Another definition
was. “The glacial age is a mcthod of
thinking."

the case of private institutions. con-
struction and repair work. and the
jobs must be in addition to the jobs
already provided by the institution.”

months of the present semester. and
Grinnell is entitled’to $14 a month
for 27 men and 23 women. according
to Mr, Nollen. “Wages for the work
are to be the same as are customs
arily paid by the college but may not
be less than an cents per hour in any
college.” he explained.

”Miss Frances Mai-ousek has been
appointed to keep the records of the
work done on the Grinnell campus

75 per cent of those aided may be
students who are in college already."
