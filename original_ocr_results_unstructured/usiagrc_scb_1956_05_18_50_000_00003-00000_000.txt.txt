In Main Depends
0n Center Building

“Thole is a possibility that
the Health center will not
be completed before school

starts in the fall," said
Norman W. Marble (build»
ings and grounds) in‘tulking
about future campus changes
and construction.

This situation would present
a housing problem for twelve
women who are to live on the
fourth floor of Main, The in»
firmary is located there now,
and the equipment will not be
moved until the ,Health Center
is completed. According to Dean
Evelyn Gardner’s plans, if such
a situation does arise, the girls
will live on Mears second.

The re—anangement of Main
has been planned by Manble and
Miss Gardner. The floor plan
includes three or tour doubles,
four or six singles, the present
kitchenette and a lounge. The
west room, now a {our-bed
men’s ward, will be converted
into a lounge which will be
available for all occupants ct

Main to use.
