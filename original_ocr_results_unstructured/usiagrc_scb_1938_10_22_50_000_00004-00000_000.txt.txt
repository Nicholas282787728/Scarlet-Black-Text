played conservative football. st.
Louis substituted quite frequently
and was obviously wearing the
smaller Pioneers down. Bob Ham-
ann’s remarkable punting drew
repeated cheers from the crowd
of 5,000 spectators. Oh one occa-
sion, be quick-inched 30 yards to
set the Billikcns back on their
own 11 yard line. ,
Fort Recovers.

It was after that particular
punt by Hamann that Grinnell
had their final chance to score.
It was in the third quarter, and
the st. Louis punt was partially
blocked from the 11 yard line.
Fort recovered the ball on the
Billiken 29 yard line. and in three
plays the Pioneers picked up 8
yards.

with fourth down and only two
to go, Luther carried the bali:but
his interference was smashed and
he was brought down for a loss
to end the only remaining threat
of the evening for Crinnell.
Pioneers Tire.

The final quarter saw a tired
Pioneer team wilt completely be-
fore the fresh power poured in by
the Billikens. Two more touchr
downs were scored as Grinncll
men let ball carriers slip through
their weary arms for continual
gains,

 

 

The Scarlet and Black's attack
was impotent as the ball carriers
were given no blocking by their
interference, and the line had
played itself out to a point of ex-
haustiun.

Grinnell Keeps nghtlng.

Crinnell hept fighting hard in

the face of terrific odds, and gave

a much better account of herself'

than the score might indicate.
The play of two sophomore
backs, Hamann and Walters, was
oustanding With the former's
punting stealing the show from
an individual standpoint for both

teams,
In the Grinnell linev Grimes
played his usual standout game
with Shepard and Sheltonl also
performing yeoman service.
