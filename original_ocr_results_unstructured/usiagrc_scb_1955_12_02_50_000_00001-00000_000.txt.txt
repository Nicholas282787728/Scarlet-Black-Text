Tuition Increase
For Next Year

President "i'{0\\'al‘d R.
Bowen announced last week
that the trustees had voted
to increase the semester tlll<
Lion by $50 per semester,
effective the second half of
this year.

He said the increase was de-
cided upon only after “careful
and lengthy study", and he
made it clea .that the interests
or scholarship students would
he considered just as careiully
in administrating the increase.

Bowen pointed out that costs
in education like many other
costs, have been constantly riSc
ing.

“Grinnell is not alone in
upping charges," he explained
"Tuition raises have been a
nationwide occurrence in the
past year, and the schools
which haven‘t already an-
iiounoed tincreases will proli-
nhly no so next year." He
said that six Midwestern con-
ference colleges have already
announced the following
boosts in annual tuition:
Carleton, 5100; Knox _$ll70:
Monmouth, $76; coo. 55in;
Lawrence, 540, and stipon, 330.

He cited several other col<
legcs in the country which have
upped the yearly tuition over
$100. and at least one university
which has increased tuition
$200.

Bowen said he hoped the in-
crease would also help lower
Grlnnell's deficit. ”Even though
it has been steadily decreasing."
he said, “we want to wipe it
out entirely, so that new im-
provement programs can he
started more easily.

in a letter explaining the i -
crease to parents, Bowen said,
“Tuition covers only a fraction
oi the cost or a Gl‘mnell educa-
tion, About $675 is provided ans
nually as a ‘hidden scholarship‘
for each student. The money is
derived from endowments and
from gifts made by friends or
the college. The recent increases
in costs are being met from
these two sourccs as well as
hour the increase in tuition.”

lle held a special discussion
session last Wednesday, Nov. 23.
to talk over the increase with
any interested students.
