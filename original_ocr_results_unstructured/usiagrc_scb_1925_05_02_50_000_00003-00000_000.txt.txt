ELECTRIC

Back in

1885, Thomas A. Edison succeeded in

transmitting electricity at 220 volts for one mile
man achievement and a promise.

The promise was fulﬁlled a few months agq
when electricity at 220,000 volts was transmitted
two hundred and forty miles to supply Los
Angeles with light and power,

Now ﬁve billion dollars are invested in electric
power plants. A Stupendous ﬁgure that: testiﬁes
to the alertness of thousands of college—trained
men who have been leaders in the production
and use of electric power.

The electrical era has only dawned. Each year
some new machine or discovery makes it possible
to apply electricity in unexpected Ways. The
graduate of today will ﬁnd electricity directly
or indirectly a means for even greater accom-
plishments, no matter what his calling in life
