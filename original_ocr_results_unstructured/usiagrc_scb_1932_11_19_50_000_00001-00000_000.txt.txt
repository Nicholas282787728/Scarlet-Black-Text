DMAHA, Neb. (Special) 7 Jack
Campbell, plucky mite quarterback
for the Creighton university Blue-
jays, had his “big chance" last week
and muffed it.

Campbell played every minute of
the Creighton»Grlnnell game last
Friday on a hard-frozen snow-swept
field, and took more than three men’s
share of hard knocks. He returned
to the Creighton campus with his
face slightly swollen, discolored and
cover-ed with sticking plaster. A
com‘ely cared met him sympathetic—
ally, with: ”0h, Jackie. did you get
hurt?”

“Nope: just frost—bitten," said
Campbell through a pair of cracked
lips.

‘Creighton Bluejays had a chance tu
hang up the best football record at
the Omaha school since 1924, as they
went into their final game of the
1932 grid season, with the Wyoming
‘unlversity Cowboys, this afternoon.
A win for the Creighton eleven would
give it a record of five victories, two
losses and one tie.

between the Jays and the Cowboys.

victory when Captain Billy Worth~
ing's place-kick split the cross-bars.
Creighton went into the game unv
der a severe weight handicap, how-
ever, as Wyoming had the heavier
team by more than ten pounds to
the man. in Scherftius, the Cowboys

215-p0und Cowboy guard, was re~
garded as one of the best linemen

Gitta Cradova,_nrilliant young pl—

good she will play with joy and the
bad she will not play at all.

“I always shall give a part of

Mme. Cradovd said, recently. “After

Smith hall, noted as one of the
three best teams at the beginning of
the season, proved its supremacy in
,specdball Wednesday afternoon by
'downing Gates in her final game, 4
to a.

Smith had not previously been de-
feated and so has sole claim to the
championship trophy.

Dibble and Gates tied for second
place: Clark was fourth, and Rawson
and Langan tied for fifth place. Dibr
lhle lost its first game to Rawson and
later lost to Smith, while Gates was
beaten by Dibblc and Smith.

in winning its games, Smith relied
mainly on its defense. W. Grounds
proved to be one of the best goal
guards of the season and stopped
many free kicks which might other-
wise have been a method of defeating
Smith.

G. Grounds, Danforth, and R. Gley-
stccn aided greatly in keeping the

The—strength of the Smith defense
can be shown by the fact that only
nine poinoz were scored against them
during the entire season. Clark was
her closest rival with 20 points scored
against her.

lead the Smith oftehse which placed
second to Dibble in the number of

Cottage Five
Wins Tourney

Defeats Mears, Two Teams

games this morning with Mears and
.Cottage Two, Cottage Five won the

lment, with scores of 2 to 0 and 3

ond played between the two teams.

ing were madc for Five by Herman,

lCooper, left wing, and Ralston, center
forward. Scorers for Two were Bar-
clay, left inner, and D. Perry, right
inner.

 

Play Fun

The play was fast but spotty at
times. Outstanding work for the win-
ning team was exhibited by Collins,
Allbright, L. Smith, and Scnissel who
lfunctioned in the backfield, As a
lwhole, the Five team had well bal-
anced strength in the forward and
back lines.

Meat-5' team was characterized by
an exceptionally strong backfield in-
cluding Coats, Nafus, and Collette.
E. Peck, of the forward line, was a
fast, hard player. Cottage Two was
outstanding for its teamwork. Perry
,and Tebbins of the forward line were
consistently threatening, while Lynn
and Horine, the latter playing goal.
protected their goal by long return
drives into the Five territory.
Mears Defeated

Although defeated in its first game
of the tournament by a combined
team of Main and Cottage Four,
Mears was pushed to the next bracket
to meet Five because of the rule that
cottages may not combine teams for
tournament games. Two went to the
semifinals by virtue of its victory
over Cottage Three. with a score of
so.

Ullrlch Outstanding

Dick Ullrich, Pioneer signal»callcr
and almost a certainty for allrconfelu
ence honors. was easily ouﬁtanding
in the Crinnell backfield. Captain
Fritz Craflund got.in some efficient
defensive work and Abe Rosenbloom
was best in the line.

The Crinnell team was outweighed
in the line by a total of about 12
pounds. but outweighed the Aggies by
the same total, in the backfield.

First Quarter March

The Aggies' opening touchdown
march began early in the first quar.
ter when Allen, Oklahoma quarter. i _
tercepted Ullrich's long pass deep in
Cowboy territory and returned it to
his own 35-yard line before being
downed.

The Oklahoma team then drove 65
yards to a, touchdown in eight plays,
making an average of eight yards per
play. Rosette made the final scoring
plunge from the Seyard line and Er-

turning the Aggies’ second kickoff to

Toss Good

Apparently superstition doesn't
mean a thing as for as foretelling
the outcome of a football game goes.

Fritz Gl'aflund's aim was straight
Wednesday afternoon when he threw
the old cleated shoe over the cross
bar into the fire.

It has been a traditional ceremony
to burn an old football shoe at the
close of the final practice of the sea-
son. If the shoe lands in the fire
when it is thrown: it is a sign that
the Pioneers will win their final game
of the season.

At the close of the practice Wed—
nesday afternoon all members of the

. varsity and freshmen football Squads

gathered around the South goal post
on Word field and watched Graflund
mRke his successful toss, While the
shoe was burning, Coach Lester Watt
gave a talk praising the second team
for its work throughout the season.

Following short talks by all the
senior inch, the final practice of the
1932 football season was over and
a deter-mined Pioneer squad was set
to meet the Aggies.
