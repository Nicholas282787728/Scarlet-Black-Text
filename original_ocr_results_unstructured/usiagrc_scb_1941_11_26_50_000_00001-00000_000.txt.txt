Cour’r Action

The cloud that has been
darkening the pocketbook of
the freshman class began to
break up Monday afternoon,
and it appeared as though
the sun would once again be
shining upon tlle yearlings.

According to Charles P.
Vogel, POWeSlllek county at—
torney, it is practically im-
possible for E. El Spencer,
Newton contractor, to bring
suit against the preps for
lumber taken last September
from his property, George
Cllal'l'ee, president of the
freshmen, said.

Threatens Suit.

Spencer was offered $25
froln Chaffee in a meeting
of the two last Friday una
der auspices of the local
police. Spencer, however,
wanted $55, and threaten-
ed to sue.

A mask of silence lies over
the opposition camp, and no
word has been heard from
Spencer as yet, Chaffee saidl

Intewiews Spencer.

In an interview at police
headquarters, Friday, Spell»
cer, dressed in blue and white
coveralls, refused to throw
any light on the situation

“I want to talk with my
associates first,” he warned.

However, with bills yet
to be collected amounting
to approximately $700, a
bank balance of $80, an
amount exceeding 860 due
from this year’s Cyclone,
and other sources of money,

debts are discovered, that
there will be any deficit,
Colbert said.

also transacted the following buse
