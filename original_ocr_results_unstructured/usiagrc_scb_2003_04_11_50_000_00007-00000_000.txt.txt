A Sound Opinion

Andrew Greenlee ’04 is Trapperts produeer. According
so srapiro, “we [Suplto and Lloyd] are responsible {or she
soap opera, and Andy's responsible for everyshing else."

Greenlee agreed. I kind ofjust make sure rhis whole
shing ends up happening, he said. More speciﬁeslly, he
edirs she recordings prepares shem, and adds sound er.
fects. He makes some alllxllc decisions on his own and
osherwise oollaborares wish Saaprro and Lloyd.

Though Greenlee has no previous KDIC expenenee,
he is a suit sound designer for she Thatet deparsmenr
and does frequent reeonling work for she Musie depart»
menr. Each Thursday nighs session records swo so sl-iree
episodes; eaeh episode requires 45 minuses to an hour so
record. Grecnlcc and the ﬁst convene around 11 pm. in
Buckshaum and work into the wee hours.

Greenlee spends moss or shas dine in a sound proof
reeordlng hoorh. “Alot orumes," Greenloesaid, “ *m lauds.
ing hystctimlly." Greenlee said he doesn’t mind laughing
alone: “I’m the son ofperson who likes to be behind the
scenes," he said. “It‘s Aron and Nick’s show and I’m just
the vehicle." In fact, Gtccnlcc has never even been inside
the KDIC studio.

Inssead, he moeo wiili Saapiro and Lloyd every Friday
nighs so edrs tl-ie reeordings fut play rhe next morning.
They spend abous rhree hours per episode Greenlee said
Suplro and Li oyd also spend a los of on air rime ralking
abous him. “So mueh ilarrery, Greenlee said wis“h

Greenlee said. "I think he‘d turn it elf,” Still, :vct the sound
