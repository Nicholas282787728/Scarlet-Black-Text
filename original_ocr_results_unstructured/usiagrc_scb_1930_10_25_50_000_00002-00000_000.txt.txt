To Some people Homecoming means the foot»

ball game with Creighton, to others it implies o
good dilllcc; but to those who are interested in
worthwhile things, and a wider education, it
means the rare opportunity of hearing Zona Gale,
one of the foremost of contemporary writers.
‘ The generosity of the lecture course eolnmittcc
lll putting Miss Galc’s talk on the semester fee, and
making it open and frcc to everyone, gives tllc stu~
dcllt body and visitors tllc chance to hear one of
the outstanding iluthors of today without any cost.
Her speech is included on the Homecoming schcdr
ulc, and should prove a drawing card [or the clltirc
weekend.

LE]. your at this time Gary Cooper was the
great attraction. hilt thi. year Grilillell has a woman
who is equally as great in 1101' own field .ds Gary is
ill his. In 1911 hcr short story, “The Amcm'call
Down,” won first prize of $2,000 ill the Dclillcotor
lnagflzillc contest, and in 1921 she rcccivcd the
Pulitzer play prize with her “ Miss Lulu Bett. ” This
year one of tllc best sellers was “Borgia” by Zona
Gale. .

Some authors can write one thing that zlppcols
to the public, but few can do it consistently nos has
Miss Gale. She lives ill the snlilll town of Portage,
Wis, with her husband and two children, scclnillgr
ly off the beaten road of modern thought, but in-
stead she finds it highly conducive to writing, and
turns out many short stories, for contemporary
magazines During the winter she will give it scrr
ics of lectures at Northwestern university on
“Modern Fiction.”

It was only through the greatest of luck that
Theta Sigma PM was able to bring her here, as she
is just passing through Iowa on her Way to Chicago
and the East. She is fitted to give a talk on f‘Ro-
cont Trends ill Modern Fiction,” and for those who
are alive to the things of today, the 1980 Homer
coming will be distinguished and individualized by
one of the outstanding mGodcrn authors, Zolla Gale.

TILE VARSITY CLUB

The varsity last night to the music of Fred
Hamill, was the first of the ycilr’s dollccs undcr
the new plan of the Varsity club. The crowd was
unusual for fl varsity dance, and though Some were
heard to maintain that the old price of $2 could
have been charged for such a dance and still the
crowd would have come out, ill general it was a
victory for the new plan. There is no doubt that
every one enjoyed the less expensive dance, and
molly felt that it the Varsity club ticket llfld admit-
ted to only the ollc dance, it would have been lllorc
than worthwhile.

When the plan of a dance fee was first dis-
cussed last year, there was considerable opposition
to it on the grounds that it should not be compul»
Sory. Among some it tended to stifle that priceless
quality of individuality in Grl-inncll to have the
entertainment of the student population ordered
wholesale, so to Speak. At, the present time the
sentiment seems to be that it is more pleasant to
be less individual to the tune of better orchestras
at lower costs, than to be more individual fewer
times to poorer orchestras at higher prices.

Commendation should be extended to all those
who have had all active part in promoting the
Varsity club idea on the campus. May it provc
most satisfactory throughout the year.

VALLEY GROSSsCOUNTRY MEET

Grinncll college is probably better known in
the athletic world for track than any otllcr sport.
Bush, Huff, Paulo, Hass, and Taylor have carried
the maltose cross to victory in all parts of the
United States and Europe.

The recent record of Coach Lcstcr Duke’s men
has been well up to standard, having Won every
dual meet for two consecutive years and two indoor

WETS GALN BY “APPORTIONMENT

Reapportionment of tho collgl iollal districts
according to the 1330 census w 1 mean an increase
of between 20 and 30 representatives for the \vets
ill congress. Tllc drys have £ll\\"ﬂyS claimed the
country. wllilc lllc wcts have secured support prillr
cipnlly from tllc city.

The new census shows a gain ill the country,
conceived to moon the lniddlewcst and W t. This
growth, however. is cclltelicd ill the large cities.
The city, ill terms of those who favor it change ill
the prohibition ameudillclit, is considered to bt‘. the
East with its nulllcrous lllctropoliscs.

Iowa will lose two of its 13 rep selltntives in
tllc ho while California, Texas, Michigan, and
New Yol t are some of tllc states which will be
allotted more. The large increase ill population of
those cities dill lg the .t 10 years is found our
tcrcd ill such cltics l Los Allgelcs, Dallas, Detroit,
and New York Cit Reapportionment will obvious
ly mean that l'cpr solitatives from the districts ill
which these cities arc included will be wct, (ts-
pccially ill the case of New York City, which rogue
lorly endorses wet policies and elects wet officials.

The wets will not expect illllllcdialc returns
from the change, but an increase of between 20
and 30 rcprcsclltotil'cs is a good start. it shall be
the duty of tllc dry liltllougll the population in-
crease of tlic nliddlcll and \Vcst is in the larl-m,
cities, to increase tllcil lauks within the city lilui s,
and to continue their work ill the “country“ with

MORE TEAMS, MORE PARTICIPANTS

A request was recently expressed ill the Big
Six conference for the establishment of “B” foot-
ball tcflms, \Vllodtoll and Notrc Dillllc have played
second [Cums for sonic ycdrs. Sonic of the eastern
colleges have as many as tllrcc soccer teams.

It is d benefit to the varsity othlctcs thcmsclvcs
to be freed from part of their burden. When there
(are luorc teams, 0 man of varsity lbl-c is much
mom of liberty to drop lliS athletics if they are
interfering with other ports of his college work.
’l‘hc responsibility pllt on basketball men to play
two or tllroc games :1 week. dud to go on almost cone
tillulll trips, coud be shifted to “B” and “0”
teams, or to fencing, wrestling, hockey, and water
polo toillus ill lllally schools.

There is always ml impulse on the other hand
to use tllc fcw best men to the limit. Coaches carry
abbreviated squads ill order to afford more varsity
games. Forensic, for instance, has announced an
intcntioll of using fewer lncll ill luorc engagements
during the coming debate season, with the idczl that
the best dcbzltcrs 'ill rod cl'tlsc Grinncll bctter.

Such ll policy is a mistake. Tllc dcbatiug coach
should try to llsc as many difl'crcnt men as possible.
The athletic department has an excellent policy in
oxpzludillg intramural and extramural athletics to
include new Sports; water polo was recently added
to the former department, and baseball to the
latter. It will be ucll if tllc athletic dopartlncnt
continues its progressive policy, and the other
organizations follow Coach Trucsdalc‘s example.

A J OB FOR PRESIDENT FRANK
(From the Milwaukee Journal)

The University of Wisconsin is seeking new methods
of discipline, or, to use a rnilder term, social control.
The ‘regents' committee on student life, it is understood,
has asked President Frank to present a plan by which
moral guidance can be carried out under a decentral—
ized system, that is, through the various colleges can:
housing units, rather than through one dean or men
and one dean of women.

Whether this is an echo of events of last spring,
when the university made the front page for a week
or more because of a. battle between Dean Goodnight
and Professor Leonard, who had challenged the dean’s
methods, we do not know. But it is indicated that Presia
em. Frank thinks there ought to be a new approach to
discipline, which is about what Professor Leonard sug-
gested. ,

Dr. Frank, it is understood, has in mind the intro—
duction of science in handling student infractions. He
would have a department armed with psychology and

psychiatry to examine the erring young man or young
woman and determine what should be done. That, per-

haps, is a good idea, if this department can be made
an agency of prevention rather than just cure. Its ﬁeld
would have to be a good deal larger than discipline.
Guidance would be a more correct term.

On the other hand, it must be said that there are

times when the university has 420 assume the role of
policeman, much as the modernistically—miuded younga

sters may dislike the idea. Grave moral violations are
violations at a university just the same as they are
anywhere else. Any doctrine, borrowed perhaps from
the art world, that a university is different from life,
will not appeal to fathers and mothers. They send their
children to the university to be protected and they will
expect protection.

It will be interesting to see what President Frank
does with the assignment the regents have given him.
