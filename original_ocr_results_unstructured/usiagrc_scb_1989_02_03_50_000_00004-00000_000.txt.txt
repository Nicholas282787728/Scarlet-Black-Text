SCARLET AND BLACK

February 3,1988

Remembering and celebrating black heritage

by Mike Ellis

Despite the idea of a melting
pot. where each of the separate
ingredients blends to make a slew
distinctly American, ethnic
groups in the United States
proudly celebrate their heritage
and their achievements. African-
Americans are no exception.
February. designated Black or
Afro-American History Month. is
a time for blacks from around the
world to Grinnell itself to focus
on their contribution to the
continuing development of
humanity. It is especially a time
for blacks in the United States to
recall their importance in the
history and development of
America. and for others to
appreciate the contributions of a
minority group too often
overlooked in the blinding white
culture.

Afro-American History
Month has its roots in the l9205.
a time remembered in most
history classes as glorious and
carefree. It was also a time when
the Ku Klux Klan used terrorist
tactics to rob blacks of a future
and school boards denied blacks a
history in school textbooks. Dr.
Caner G. Woodscn. who during
his lifetime wrote many books
on black history. was determined
that blacks should study and
appreciate their ancestors'
contributions to American
history. In response to the
prevalent oppressive attitudes
towards blacks, Woodsen
introduced Negro History Week
in 1926. Although the color

bratory days were chosen to be
close to the birthdays of Frederick
Douglass and Abraham Lincoln,
Woedsen wanted blacks not to
concentrate on Lhc achievements
of a few exceptional individuals,
but to remember all blacks who
contributed to the making of a
black culture in America. Later.
this black cultural observance
was expanded to include the entire
month of February.

Twentyrscven events have
been scheduled on campus for
Black History Month. The ﬁrst
of these is a soul-food bazaar,
scheduled for tonight from 7 to 9
pm. in PDR S of the Forum.
Eric Wynn. director of Minority
Affairs. described soul food as
“spicy and delicious” and called it
“a food indigenous to a people
who experience life with we
huberance and spirit." The dishes
are “typical for most black
Americans" according to Sandra
Carter. assistant director of
Minority Affairs. The soul-food
menu includes Lraditional foods
such as greens. which Caner calls
“the AfricanvAmci-ican equivalent
of spinach." black-eyed peas.
eaten on New Year's Day for
good luck. and chctvpolalo pie,
a common Thanksgiving dessert
made with nutmeg and cinnamon.
Also being served are red beans
and rice, potato salad. fried fish,

program is part ot an effort to
attract minority scholars to the
campuses of small liberal—arts
colleges. Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Steve Jones. who
has helped develop the program.
said applications are still being
accepted for up to 30 positions
nationwide. so he does not know
in which department the scholar
will be placed in Grinncll. “We

are looking at people in every
discipline," he said.

Nineteen schools. all part of
the Consortium for a Strong
Minority Presence [Liberaerrls

program. A brochure printed by
Grinnell College explains the
need for a strengthened minority

increased minority presence will
create a “greater diversity of
experience and perspective within
the faculty and in the curriculum"
as well as providing role models
for minority students.

The program will offer two
types of fellowships: the
dissertation fellowship. for
scholars who have completed all
the requirements for the doctorate
except the dissertation. and the
postdoctoral fcllowshtp. The
dissertation fellows will teach
one semester course or its
equivalent during the year of
l’CSlLlCl'le. participate in
departmental seminars. and
interact wtih students. They will
receive a salary based on tin
average of the salaries paid to
starting instructors by
participating schools.

Post-doctoral fellows will
have the same responsibilities as
dissertation fellows, except that
they will teach one course each
semester. Postdoctoral fellows
will receive compensation based
on an average of the salaries paid
by the participating schools to
beginning assistant professors.
In addition. the participating
college will provide “suirtrup”
funds of between $3,000 and
$5,000 to finance proposed
research.

Jones said that the Minority
Scholar-In-Residence Program is
designed to focus on minority
groups that are “under-
represented" on liberalrarts
crunpuscs. These groups include
Native Americans, African
Americans and Hispanic-
