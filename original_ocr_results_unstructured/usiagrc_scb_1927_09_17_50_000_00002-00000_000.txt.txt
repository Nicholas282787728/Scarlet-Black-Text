- MORE ADVICE. ‘

The Grinncll SCARLET AND BLACK adds its Wel-
come to the many which you freshmen have already
received. We hope that. this ﬁrst. year in college and
the years that are to follow shall be truly counted as the
happiest in your lite; we could not wish you more.

Freshmen receive and need more advice than any
other class or persons, snd perhaps heed less. The
reasons are these. They are the better part or those
who were in high school and while there on attention
was focussed on them. They are the students who had
the leads in their class plays, who were editors of their
school papers, who were presidents or classes and organi~
rations, who were captains ond stars inrtootball, basket»
baﬁ and track, who were honor students. u

,The majority or them come from small towns, where
,thcir hrilliancy and versatility have been the talk or the
community. There are others who have been more

ho utl ill and not us brilliant, but who have been the
social leaders of their little groups. That is wherc tlic
llitliculty lies when such a group or lreshmen arrive at
college. I

Those persons who are rated as upperclassmcu have w
lnul the same experiences and, further than that, have
weathered the storm or a year or more or college lite.
But those persons hay-c iittcd themselves into the scheme;
and that is what this freshman class must do. It must
not expect to accomplish too much at ﬁrst.

That is Where too many freshmen spoil their chances
ior a college "career" (ii there is such a. thing). They
try to be “popular” the ﬁrst few months, and they Some~
times go to extremes tn do 50. People are not interested
in you, they are interested in themselves. And if you
manifest that interest in them sincerely they Will soon

number of real friends, not acquaintances, that they have
and keep.

It. is som times difficult for freshmen to ”make" the
