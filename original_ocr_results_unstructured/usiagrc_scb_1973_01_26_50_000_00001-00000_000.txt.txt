Uneasy Relief Over Cease-Fire

by Dan Dagenais

Torn in the past by emotional an»
tiwar demonstrations and a long-
continuing protest of United States
policy in Vietnam,tneGrinnellcam—
pus heard news of a Vietnam ceasev
fire this week with calmness and
an uneasy reliei coupled with rings
ging doubts. The euphoria and ela-
tion some expected did not mater-
ialize as students and faculty alike
expressed pleasure with the war's
end hear “at last,” but continued
to feel apprehensive over the luture
of American policy in Indochina
The crowd of students watching
President Nixonannuuncetheagree-
ment over the television inthe South
Lounge last Tuesday listened in a
silence broken only by occasional
Whispers and a few hall-hearted cat-
Calls at the Presidential rhetoric,
One, who expressed disappointment
over broken promises in the past,
said “This seems exactly like Ocs
tober—-what took two months?" Ots
hers doubted whether the war was
really over, commenting that "I
don't really think Nixon will keep
the bombers outH 01‘ Simply “I
don't believe it.”

Most students and. faculty, how—
ever, expressed pleasure over the
settlement which had come after
so many years “If it had happened
after the first inauguration it would
have been fine," said one sopho-
more. But better late then never:
“This is morally superior to leav—
ing the killing going on,”

”I’m pleased that this has finally
ended,” said Political Science Pro»
lessor Edwin Gilmour, ”but I just
can't help but feel really passion~
ately that it should have happened
four or five years ago. I’m just
turned off by the crass phoniness
of it all-~Kissinger has saidpuhlic-
ly that this is all geared toward
assuring a ‘decent lnterval’between
the settlement and the collapse of
South Vietnam, And to make thisthe
basis upon which to invest the lives
of American boys appalls me."

A few students and the antiwar
Peace Collective expressed a den
sire to keep working for changes
in United states foreign policy, but
most seemed numbed by years of
protest and were Willing to forget
it all, “It's over-Jet's turn our

Walker Restricts Independents

by Curt Gnrrell

Without any prior notification to
student leaders, Dean Walker ye .
terday handed out a dictum limit-
ing the number of Independents he
will allow to be undertaken this
semester. In practice, this appears
to be a retroactive measure, as
Assistant Dean James Hamilton has
been returning a number of Indes
pendent project forms to students
without approval.

SGA ViceePresident Anne Walter
is deepiyvconcerned by this move

What grounds does Mr. Walker
have to make this type of pronoun-
cement two weeks into the semes-
ter, when studentsalreadyhavetheir
schedules, including plans for in-
dependents, worked out l’

Walter is concerned not only with
the effect of this stated policy on
individual students, but also with
the fact that Walker’s action come
pletely bypasses the All College
are which is currently in the pres
cess of formulating new guidelines
for Independents.

The text of Walker’s letter which
makes this policy states, in part
that an individual faculty member
may supervise up to a total of 18
credits of Independent 397 or 398;
up to a total of 18 crdits of Guided
Reading Projects; or a combined
number of Independent projects and
guided reading projects that total
a maximum of 28 credits for a
given semester."

Walker’s letter goes on to state
that Faculty members who wish
to have special consideration in re-
gard to these rules should discuss
this possibility With the Dean oi
the College,"

Walker’s rationale for this action
is to ensure ,..quality of super-
vison..”, and to ...protect tac-
ulty members trom becoming over-
leaded with these obligations,”

But where is the consideration
in this measure for the protection

more immediate things," said one
senior. In the dining halls and dor-
mitories few students were willing
to talk about the peace. Most ids
cused their attentions elsewhere.

Wayne Moyer, Political Science
instructor, voiced similar feelings.
“I just don’t feel there is that much
difference,” be said, “There’s no
real change in us. policy. rm
worried that the war will fade out
of focus--we won’t care toaskabout
our role in Southeast Asia any-
more,” Associate ProfessorofSoc-
iology George Furnlss expressed
a hope that the U 3, would supply
economic aid now to ”both North
and South Vietnam. It's going to be
very hard to get their economy
back on its feet,"

a tew protessors,anticipating such
a reaction, expressed apprehension
over the coming apathy, “Whatwe've
done now is totally internalize the
thing,” said Assistant Professor of
History Richard Kagan, “The war
will really literally disappearin our
minds...the killing will disappear
from the news. We’ve made this
an invisible war even more. He
(President Nixon) has stopped the
war lor Americans, but he has not
done anything about the forces
which brought this crisis about,"

The feeling that U S. involvement
in Indochina will continue typified
several student and faculty respon-
ses. “What concerns me is that
he is stillvery much concernedabout
the expansion of Communism,
American honor the Americanpres-
iige,” said Moyer, “I don’t think he
is going to get militarily involved
again, but what i see is a continuae
tion at America’s going into Souths
east Asia to help governments in
that area, by any means shortoface
tual military intervention.” Moyer
cited more extensive CIA involve-
ment as a distinct possibility.

Most, however, expressed hope
that the United States had learned
tron-i the experience. Citing his
own experience in India recently,
Gilmoui" noted that “Nehru's ans-
wer was that the best defense a-
gainst Communism was to make
democracy work in your own coun-
try. We should have had this at-
titude twenty years ago,"

Hamilton: Evaluations Vital

by Merry Wiesner

jitter nearly a year and a halt of trial runs,
in which the results of the Faculty Evaluation
forms were carefully studied by the administra-
[Ion-2nd faculty members, the forms have become
an important part of the Executive Council’s

The evaluations were handed out in the spring

of 1971 for the first time in a trial run, and then
for both semesters of the 1971-1972 year, With the
stipulation that they would not betabulatedandused
until two semesters’ forms were In. Thustheywere
first used this fall.

data on faculty decisions,

Dean James Hamilton commented that in his
judgment “the information provided by the evals
nations has been important", and went on to say
that he felt in some cases that the evaluations
had the largest weight of any single input 0“
faculty teaching performance.

However, Hamilton perceives a “sharp trailing
off in student cooperation", for second semester
returns from last year were far below those of
the first semester, and he does not anticipate
any Increase in this semester’s returns, Any d9-
cllne in the amount turned in will mean a decrease
in the validity of the survey. and in the weight
put to it by the Executive Council. Hamilton, thuSi
wants to “encourage cooperation in the strongest
possible way”, In his opinion, the evaluations have
been used and have made an impaCt. If students
take them seriously and fill them out carefully,
he feels students can have significant impact on
faculty personneli decisions.
other members of the Executive Council also in-
dicated that they felt the evaluations weredeftnitely
used, and, although not assigning them Primary
importance, noted that the information proviGEd
by. the forms was a better indication of student
opinion on :i particular faculty member than any
other previous method.

Hamilton noted that in many cases the Student
EPC recommendations from individualdepartmenls
paralleled the allecampus evaluation forms, but
sees this as a check on both processes, rather
than a duplication of etlort.

Each member or the Executive Council was given

a form for each faculty member whose position
was up for discussion. The form indicatesthe posis
tion of that person in relation to every other fac»
ulty member, which was derived from the question
on the evaluation relating to overall performance,
The rating of each course that instructor taught,
provided five or more people from the course

responded, was also indicated. Hamilton wants to
stress the fact that these ratings are relative,
not absolute, so a low rating does not necessarily
mean ineffective teaching, thoughit certainly might.

The evaluations show some interesting overall
results. Students ranked 30.3% of faculty in the top
10% categOry on overall performance, 31.9% in
the next 20%, 22.1% in the middle 40, 6.9% in the
next 20, and only 3.1 in the bottom 10. Thus well
over 50% of the faculty were rated in the top
quarter.

The ratings on specific questions followed this
general pattern quite closely, With the faculty
as a whole rating highest on adequacy of prepara-
tion and availability outside of class. The only
category that ratings were significantly lower on
was skill in leading discussions’

The rank at a faculty member appears to make
little difference in the students’ ratings, as the
proportions of full professors, associates, assise
tahts and instructors in the top quarter is nearly
even with those In the bottom quarter Individual
characteristics of students, such as class rank,
5 P.A,, or expected grade also make little signi-
ficant difference.

half.

The young people were there, the
usual students and hippies, but a
type of person never before seen in
large numbers, the middle class
American, also attended. Whenask-
ed why he was there, one man ans-
wered, “I voted for Nixon and I’m
ashamed. I just had to showhim that
I don’t support him any longer.”
At the rally which followed, Rep,
Eella Abzug (Dell so) made a rous-

“A few of us in Congress who are
among the sponsors of this rally,
