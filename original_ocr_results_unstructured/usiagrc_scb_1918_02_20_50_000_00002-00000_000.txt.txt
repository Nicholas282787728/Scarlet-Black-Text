OUR COLLEGES
(From the Des lloincs Register)

its a war measure the colleges
should he sustained. They have been
the patriotic rail ing places in every
state, their boys have led in every ens
listment, it has been college men who
have ﬁlled the training camps. and res
sponded to every call for dangerous
service. It the graduates and the un-
dergraduates were all at once talten
li-oni the American army we should
be years away from heing ready to
ﬁghL

ln not a single instance has a col-
lege protested, although its very liie
'llload was being drained as the boys
donned their iinifoims. hbothall ﬁelds
bait been turned into parade grounds
by college authorities, and military
drill has been substituted tor other
athletic erciscs. No business in this
country has snlici-ed so much and

- made so little complaint, and no busi-
ness loolts into so black a future.

The college has not only been ﬁrst
to respond to the call oi war, it is go-
ing to be ﬁrst to render the indispen-
sable services of returning peace. Will:
is going to solve the enormous pron
loins of the next ntty ycars if the boys
of eighteen are not to have the host
the colleges ot today can give them in
preparatory training? Does anybody
lielicve the future will be socurc in the
hands of any but trained iiicn? Never
will there be such a call for men who
can think quickly and accurately and
who have back or them a large knawL
edge of history and an intimate ac—
tiuaintance with modern politics and
economics.

The appeal comes home to lowa as
to no other state, tor iowa leads all
the states in the number or her col-
leges. Can any college city in Iowa
aitnrd to let its schools go down? Can
thc state as a whole nrlortl to let its
schools go down? The Register does
not know cl any ind' idual instance
where tlic no is so immediately
[)rc.‘ ing as that question might s g-
go L But crcryhody must know that
in cvcry instance there is need or ens
couragcmcnt and ﬁnancial support.

The Register cannot too strongly
urge the call of the college upon cv-

oiy college city and town, upon the
immediate friends of every college and
school of higher cdilcatlon, and upon
the business community. It will not
do to let education suffer, no matter
what also may suffer from this war.
We shall neither be so patriotic a pear
ple llor so capable a people if our col-
leges are not sustained,

The invading ﬁve seemed unable to
overcome the lead that Cornell tool:
ill the ﬁrst few minutes, and tllc half
ended 23 to 11. Grigsby had six ﬁeld
goals to his credit and was nndoubk
edly the star of the hall. Augustine
and Kepler, playing the opposing posi»
[ions at center, kept each other from
scoring very siicccssiully, each slips
plug in but one ﬁeld basket during the
half.

The visitors camc back strong in the .

second half. The score for the half
“4‘ s 13 to 11 in their favor, but they
were unable to
against the lead Cornell got in the
previous period. Grigsby was watched
so closely that he was unable to count
ally baskets this half. Scliiers played

the [:tstesl. game of ally of the Grinncll .

ﬁcldgoals to his credit. Had Grinncll .
