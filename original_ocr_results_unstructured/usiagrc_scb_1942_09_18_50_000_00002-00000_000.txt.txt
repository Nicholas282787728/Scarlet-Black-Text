THIS IS THE CRUCIBlE--

We’ve been going to classes for three days
now. We‘re still pretty confused, It’s
a long way from the little theater to the
men’s gym, 7:45 classes are awfully early,,
and conditioning doesn‘t come at the right
times.

But somehow, through the maze of de
tails and confrences and conflicts, the pat-
tern is beginning to show. It’s been a long
time since Grinnell college has opened in a
War year—not since 1917. It’s been a long
time since students have been anything but
secure in their arrangements for the year,
We’ve always known where we were going
to live and with whom; we’ve known our
way around A. R. H. and the chalky smell
of classrooms, Now the dorms are scatter-
ed, and A. R. 1—1. will soon be “restricted
area." Maybe we long for the old security,
the old escapism of the Grinnell we knew.

But the pattern begins to show.

‘ There was a certain understandable come
placency about the life we lived. There was
a permanence beyond threat of interruption.
Now we‘ve been interrupted. 'And pulsing

security, there has come the students and
the faculty of this college a deeper wave of
accepance and new strength,

This is the crucible. If we can, now, with
the old physical foundations of our inter—
est in the college disrupted, still preserve
and increase that interest, if we can feel not
the compulsion of duty but the growth of
devotion, then there is nothing very much
to fear in other days and other situations.

There is very little of ”duty” in the way
we feel in giving our traditional welcome
to the new students and faculty on campus
this fall. We‘ve been saying “Hellkand
welcome” to new people fora long time, We
have made the explanations of what goes
on here. This year we aren’t so sure ourc
selves. Things may happen now which will
surprise us as much as they do the youngest
prep, We are no longer in the position of
secure upperclassmen, sure of ourselves and
of campus events, who may take into our
group, after a period of probation, another
class of freshmen, This year we are all, in
a sense, freshmen. We claim no false com—
placency. Our school is now in a serious
period of transition. We are adapting our-
selves to an emergency situation. It may
be a long time before we go back to com-
plete security.

And it’s going to take work by all of us,
not just the big men on campus, to keep
the essence of Grinnell, to preserve what is
best here, and to refuse complaints for pass-
ing things.

That will be, as much as any other ser—
vice we could render, a palt of this national
tional effort in war time. We have no il—
lusions about ourselves or this school. We
aren‘t going to win or lose the war here by
ourselves, and mllch of what we do may he
trival. But we believe only the trivialities
will be permantly changed in Grinnell’s war-
time years. We believe what is best will
stay, despite A. R. H., the White House, or
even the dorms.

That is why this year is the crucible, That
is why, needing all of you as we do, we can-
not say merely welcome to Grinnell. We
must add, “Thanks for coming; we can use
