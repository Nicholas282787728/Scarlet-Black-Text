November 3, 1987: South
Lounge was packed with students.
administration, and faculty. They
had come to see a panel of black
and White students air their
perceptions of racism at Grinnell.
They came to listen and learn, not
to respond or discuss. The im-
mediate reaction to the Speakeasy
was enthusiastic. Most were
stunned by What they heard and
saw. It was a powerful, eye-
opening experience for all who
attended, and equally exhausting
and satisfying for the participants.

But 16 months later, does the
challenge elicited by the
Speakeasy remain strong'.7
Through a series of interviews J
realized that although general
racial awareness and interaction
has changed somewhat. a differ-
once of opinion exists about the
degree of success of the
Speakeasy.

The Speakeasy’s format was
such tiiat there was no dialogue
between panel and audience. The
purpose of this style was to allow
the black students to state their
views without the fear. that their
comments would be intellectualr
ized and overanalyzed, as they
would have been under a tWOV
sided format. Kcsho Scott, the
panel’s faculty adviser, said that
the format gave the marginalized
students a voice they had never

prevrously possessed. Pleshette
Hamb, a panelist, and student
Mike Coulter concurred, stating
that the ability of black students
to speak to the entire school
about their concerns without dan-
ger of rcprisal was “empowering"
to the participants and the black
community as a whole.

The principal goal of the
evening was to raise campus
consciousness of the institution-
alized racism that permeates ev»
eryone‘s daily existence, regard-
less of race, Coulter, who is
black, saw the program as an at-
tempt to improve the everyday
interactions between blacks and
whites. and acknowledged that
this sort of change has mken
place to a certain extent. And
students Julie Cohen and Kate
Guggenheim, wlto are white,
both felt that their awareness and
subsequent behavior towards

Millage

blacks have been largely influ-
enced by the power of the
Speakeasy.

But'it is ironic that the phrase
often associated with the occasion
is that the Speakeasy was “like
the train that goes through Grin-
nell." Chris Hollins, a panelist
who made this statement, ex-
plained that like so many other
issues that arrive in Grinnell with
a dramatic impact, they are in
time reduced to secondary conr
ccrns behind the quest for the 4.0.
He perceived Grinnell's attitude
toward social change to be one of
procrastination. Hamb pointed
out that the Speakeasy helped to
form alliances and friendships be
tween not only blacks, but also
between groups such as Con-

the Black Women’s Support
Group, Women's Group, and the
Grinnell Lesbian/Gay Alliance.
However, she disagreed with the
assessment that attitudes had
changed significantly, citing nu-
merous classroom incidents in
which the sole black Student in
the course was presumed to be the
autilority on matters of color,
something most of the panelists
had experienced.

The most obvious absence of
change Since the Speakeasy has
been in the area of curriculum.
Hamb and Hollins were critical of
the administration‘s reaction to
the Speakeasy, saying that sim-
ply leaving the door open to
black students wasn't enough.
l-Iamb believed that the lion's
share of the task of increasing the
numbcr of black professors anti

diversifying the curriculum re
mains in the hands of the stu-
dents. Slie asserted that the time
commitment necessary to achieve
these goals jeopardized blacks'
potential academic success. She
also said that most of the “black"
classes were taught by one of our
three black professors, and that
many of these are special-topics
courses, not part of the regular
curriculum. Slle feared that if any
of the professors left, these
classes would be discontinued.
Such an occurrence could spell
the end of the AfrorAmerican
studies concentration.

Although l-lollins applauded
the addition of 30 black freshmen
this year, he felt that such re-
Cruitmcnt efforts should continue

Seeking truth through power

Reflections on the Speakeasy Big Chief Mohasky

by Alex Young

March 8 witnessed the first
performance of one of Grinnell’s
most recently formed campus
bands. Big Chief Mohasky
features John Littlcton (vocals),
Eugene Weaver (vocals), Chris
Pmcunier (guitar), Todd Thrcet
(guitar), Eric Sandinc (bass), and
Sean Riley (drums).

The excitement in Hector's
was overwhelming as the band
jammed song after song of tight,
hardcore thrash, a form of music
which truly exemplifies the
ideological beliefs of the band.
Bodies slammed into one another
as John Littleton and Eugene
Weaver screamed out “lyrics to
loosen the bowels of a consti-
pated America!" The pinnacle of
the 16-song sci came about 40
minutes into the show while the
band played a throbbing version
of The Buttholc Surfers'
“Twenty-two Going on Twenty-
thrce." The police made an abrupt
and porcine entrance with the aim
of turning down the volume.
Apparently a person three blocks
away had complained about the
noise level. Tile police officers
did not ask any questions but
merely turned down the sound and
left.

Despite the untimely
interruption, the band played oti
with renewed vigor. Chris

Procunicr led the band into a
grotesque and chilling version of
“Hi There,” a song written by
Killdozer. The song is about the
release of bottled-up anxiety and
tension which seemed very fitting
given the recent police intrusion.

The tnusic provided a striking
medium for the expression of the
band's frustrations about various
societal orthodoxies. This was
made strikingly clear by the
closing song, “1 Understand,"
written by the Angelic Upstarts,
in which a young Jamaican is
thrown into a British prison
where he is later killed for no
reason other than tile unorthodox
nature of his religious and
political beliefs.

Vocalist Eugene Weaver
sunlmed up how Grinnell has
shaped the band‘s beliefs when he
exclaimed vehemently, “You look
at us and see our hair, and we’re
drinking beer, but that‘s just the
typical shallowvminded knee-jerk
liberal Grinnell perception.
We're really Itumnn libertarians
seeking truth dlrough power!"

Big Chief Mohasky is now
working on new material for use
in future gigs in which their own
personality will be felt even more
strongly than before.

 

for all minority groups until the
Grinnell population reflects the
national average. He also pro
posed that instead of'esiablishing
new “black" classes, tnore
professors should concentrate on
changing their course formats so
that they present opposing culr
tural viewpoitlts. Scott agreed
with this, saying that the class
room is as important to the
retention of black students as are
the minority recruiting efforts,
and until we attain diversity, there
will be a need to speak easy.

But Scott viewed the Speakeasy
in a different light. She felt that
instead of being about
institutional change, it was
“designed to take power. . .to
empower the voiceless voices.
and it did it." She pointed out that
there is a difference between the
voiceless and invisible and the
voiceless and visible, and that as
a result of the Speakeasy, black
students will never be voiceless
again. in addressing the students'
criticisms, she said that the
Speakeasy was only part of the
struggle to end racism: “(lt) was

not a magic wand to wave every-
thing right. There is no fairy
godmother solution to racism."
She also stressed that she was not
disagreeing with the complaints,
but merely counting the victories
that were achieved. Scott said
that she still feels frustration, but
she refused to ignore the p05il|\‘c
side, such as the student leaders
that she watcltcd emerge from the
“heroic" experience, and the fact
that speaking easy is now a
mechanism for tile struggles of
other oppressed groups.

Thus it seems that despite the
need for additional change, the
mere fact that the Speakeasy took
place leaves the participants with
a legacy of commitment to
progress. There/is no reason to
believe that it will get any easier.
As we prepare to leave Grinnell
we should internalize the
challenge left by the Speakeasy
and strive to allow the experience
to manifest itself in ourselves and
our interactions with others.
This maturation will begin to
open doors to institutional
change.
