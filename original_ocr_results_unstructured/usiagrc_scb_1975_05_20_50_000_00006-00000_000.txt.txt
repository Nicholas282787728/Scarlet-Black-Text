Fantasy becomes a reality

b\ Elliott lcuis

Gr innell is a place where Ianlasy
becomes a reality Asitle irom the
shared burden or academic rigor,
to which we all must answer, just
about anything is possible. it you
like, you can be a rock star or a
super athlete, or. you might dare
to enter the world of politics. Many
of us have just tried to be diftercnt,
and perhaps better outline our
personalities, Many of our per-
sonalilles still need to go through a
period ot adjustment; while some
of us need to finertune our fantasies
and aspirations to discover where
the fine line between the two exists.

Grinnell has given a lot of people
a chance to learn what the world is
about without being in it Un-
fortunately, Grinnell is a lot oi
things the world is not, There is
love and concern here; losers can
win and the young can grow
mature while the mature become
prophets. Sure, like everywhere
else. lhere is an establishment,
oppressed minorities, institutional
food and graffiti, but so what?
Living in tantasy we can. and have,
overcome it all.

What did i do? I simply tried to
fill the air with the best music I
could produce. Man, I couldn't
believe the number of savage
beasts that needed soothing around
here. Through no iault oi my own, i
didn't learn a whole lot about
music. but I did learn what music
does to and {or people. Because of
that education. I'd like to con-
tribute something to the field if I
can. and maybe someday inspire
another Grinnellian the way
Hancock has moved me.

So what of Grlnllcll and fantasy?

Grinncll College fantasizes things
about itself that are hard to
stomach. We try to be a multi
racial, multicultural, liberal, hie
sexual. prog ssive, liberal arts
institution that Mars the option to
specialize Well, I think we’re
doing OK on most fronts Most will
agree that there is a little
something here {or everybody, and
the administration (or most of it)
has lelt the needs of the students,
and met at least halt-way, most oi
the time.

lworry a lot about the ”Arts” in
our liberal Arts claim We should
avoid moving too strongly in any
one direction. It is the alternative
to the traditional and formal that
keeps us In a type ot academic
“third world”. None of us can
afford to lose this perspective nor
can we fantasize that Grinnell is
stable enough to depend on
momentum. lRemember what we
said about South Viet Nam")

There may be some who think
Fantasy is too strong a word tor the
wonderful world of Grinnell, I
don't. I just realized how lantastic
the people and physical makeup of
this college is. I stand amazed at
the curriculum, Iowa, our football
team and all of the other amazing
realitles that make this place real,
and ask myself “Why am I here”"
The answer is obvious; it is
because a lot of other people used
their imaginations and changed
this place into its present
existence

There is not much difference
between iantasy and imagination;
in fact. one cannot exist without the
other. It has been both that have
made Grinnell what it's been for
me: “Fantastic". Like Carole King
says,

"In fantasy you can be anything
ynll want to be

And someday our reality will be
as good as neverrnever lands"
