Swim teams capture victory in MWC championships

Both men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams win easily, sweep all ten relay races, and break several records

BY DEVIN Ross

For the last time ever, the men’s and women’s swimming
and diving teams plunged into the waters ofthe Obermiller
Pool for last weekend’s MWC championship meet. once
again, Grinnell did not disappoint as they swept, with the
women winning the championship for
the 11th consecutive year and the men
winning for the 8th.

The meet took place over the weele
end of February 13715. At the end of
three grueling days, the women has
ished with 1253 points, more than
doubling secondeplaec Lawrence Unis
versity,whieh had 583 pointssThe men
stood with a score of 1301.5 points,
well ahead of secondeplace Monmouth
College. On both sides, the teams
dominated the leadetboatd, breaking
records and reaching goals.

Both the men’s and women's team swept the relays,
which hadn’t been accomplished since 2005. “The (Cl'rl'ElZly
sweep was money," said swimmer Tom Lankicwicz ’12. “It
was something we needed to do."

on the women's side, Morgan Boher’lZ shined through
out all three days ofthe meet. On the second day ofthe meet
alone, Bobei' was responsible (or hteaking the school record,
the pool record and the overall MWC record in the IOU-yard
breaststroke with a preliminary time of1:06.39.Thc ch
meet record hadn't been broken since 1996,whi1e the school
record hadn’t been broken since 1984. Bienking these re—
cords also earned Bober a NCAA “B” qualifying standard.

“it’we get to go [to nationals], that's great, but otherwise,
we have three more years] think it's fantastic that we’re al-
ready here,” Bober said. “It's a goal, tour you never think that
it's realistic and then all ofa sudden it might be"

On the ﬁnal day of the meet, the women's team was led
by Valerie Stimac ’09 who shattered four records while wine
ning the lOO-yard treestyle. Stimac broke her own school
record set in 2007, as well as the meet and overall conference
record from 1998, Morgan Horton ’11 (the 583's Opinion
editor) gained more wins for the women’s team with first
place in the zoo butterﬂy as well as by participating in the
400 treeestyle relay team which also ineluded Meghan Mce
Doniel ‘10, Casey Strickler ‘12 and Stimac.

Though most teams were not seen as competition for
both the men and the women, Monmouth College managed
to ignite a fit: within the Pioneers.

H‘Monmouth hung their kilt over our Maddog Mascot,"
said Cy Mistry ‘11. “So we took it to the next level."

Lankiwicz went one step furthei in ciiricizing the ac-
tions taken by the Fighting Scots. “It was poor sportsman-
ship and we didn’t like that," he said. “We had to stick it to
them.”

Lankiewicz and Mistry both broke school records on the
second day of the meet. Lankiewicz’s time of 4:15.30 in the
400 IM broke an 18-year»old Grinnell record.

“I really thought that some goals were out or my reach,
but I think that good coaching got me there, 1 accomplished
my goal," LankieWicz said. “I really wanted to set the team

record, and I did. I honestly didn’t think thatI could do it.
It was great to prove myselfwrong."

Mistry broke his own school, meet and pool records by
placing ﬁrst in the ZOO-yard breaststroke. His time of2:07.5
provisionally qualiﬁed him for NCAA “B" nationals, though
he will have to wait
a couple ofweeks to
know for sure.

“I was honored to
get a Becut,and I felt
really good about my
swim," Mistry said.
“All the hard work
we put in paid off.
Nationals will he on
another level, but it's
deﬁnitely something
Iwant to experience,
itnor this year, in the future"

In diving. Nick Smith ’10 and Kelly Bruce '12 were r8*
spectively named men's and women's Divers of the Year.
Smith placed first in both the oneemeter and threeemcter
diving events.

Bruce dominated Women's diving, also plating ﬁrst in

fun together”

“"Im’a. , ’ fa

”A lot of my tompetltion is on our
own team. lt’s nrte; they’re there
t0 push you, but at the same time,
there’s no pressure. We y'ust have

both the one- and threeemeter diving events, Bruce come
plered the event with a NCAA “B" qualifying score.

“I’m just really excited because no one's ever really sure it
they’re going to make cuts," Bruce said. “It was more excit-
ing to see people meet their goals.

Both the men’s and women‘s sides
believed that their success was due to the
dedication of their coach Erin Hurley,
who received the title of Men’s Coach
of the Year.

“This meet was a big deal on Hur-
ley's part, she's a phenomenal coach,”
Mistry said. “Deﬁnitely deserved get—
ting named Men's Coach of the Year.”

As a ream, Grinnell saw no serious
competition at the meet. The depth of
Grinnell's swimmers and divers proved
to be a tough march.

“On an individual basis, in different events, it'll be one
good swimmer rrom one school, but not one speciﬁc school
that can compete with us,"Bruce said, “A lot ofn-iy competie
tion is on our own team. It's nice; they’re there to push you,
but at the same time, there‘s no pressure. We just have fun
togethei."
