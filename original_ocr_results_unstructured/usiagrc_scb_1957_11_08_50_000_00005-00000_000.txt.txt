The Grinnell Pioneers will
play the final home game of
the 1957 season against the
Monmouth Scots tomorrow.
Monmouth employs the

ing the past week the fresh-
man squad has been running
the Monmouth offense in'order
to get our defense in good shape.

Last year Grinnell beat the

Scots to score its only victory
of the season. The odds for ans
other Pioneer victory tomorrow
are very good. Monmouth has
yet to fall into the win column
n the standings and an upset
does not seem probable.

After their Second tie in as
many Weeks, Grinnell will be
out to tear this Monmouth squad
apart. Not since the Coe game,
has the pioneer single-wing
shown the home crowd much
action.

The weather may he a de—
ciding factor in the outcome
or this contest. Lost week the
Pioneers played Knaxtin a
cold mist. The field was rnnd—
dy and as a result our fast—
running game oould not get
started, The. weatherman in
his report is not too encourag—
ing, but the Grinnoll camp is
hoping that he is wrong.

Tomorrow's game will see
seven seniors in their last home
contest, They are the co-cap-
tains Jack Shaffer, and Charlie
Adams, Bob Carothers, .Jerry
Kurth, Howard Ohiine, John
Orsborn and Gary Pattsohuil.
All of these men will see a lot
of action tomorrow.

The series against the Scots.

began way back in 1898, Ibult
only 13 games have been played
Since then. The Series record is
seven wins for Grinnell and six
for MonmCuth, Last year We
won at Monmouth 23-13. The
only series which dates back
farther than this is against
Carleton. It began in 1892.

Grinnell can, by winning its
last two games, end the sea-
son with a 3-3-2 record. This
would put the Pioneers in
fourth place, a better position
than they have held for about
15 years, Monmouth will be
up for ‘the game since they
have no intentions of keeping
the conference cellar posi ‘on.

The probable starting ‘lineup
for Grinnell is Lee Moses at

Achieve Tie Willi Knoﬂ

By JDhn Smith

The Pioneers spotted Knox
a one touchdown lead in the
first half but stormed back
after the intermission to
gain a 7-7 tie. The last half
surge by the Pioneers was
further evidence of the fine
spirit and determination that
the squad has shown in all
games this fall.

Crinncll was unable to
move the ball to any extent in
the first half. The field at
Gnlesbnrg, 111., was muddy and
tho Slwnsh were poinh‘ng for
a victory to climax their Par-
ents‘ boy activities.

The Pioneers total offense for
the first half was a puny three
yards. Knox launched a success-
ful touchdown drive in the first
quarter although they were
stymied momentarily as Grin-

left end, Gary Nolder or Dick
Yaki at left tackle, John Ors-
born at left guard, Bob Grindey
at center. On the right side of
the line Jerry Kurth will start
at end, Bruce Wilkerson at
mckle, Charlie Adams at guard.

In the backfield the blocking
back will be Dave Allen, Jack
Shaffer at wingbaclr. John
Copeland at tailback and Larry
Dukes or Gary Pattschull at
fullback.

nen’s defense dug in and held
for three downs before yielding
a TD on fourth down and one
foot to go.

Coach Peterson‘s boys looked
iike a different team in the sec-
ond half. With tailback, John
Copeland at the throttle chario-
neers took command and com-
pletely dominated play in the
final two quarters.

Grinnell marched quickly
into scoring position in the
third quarter as Copeland
skirted end for 15 yards to the
Knox 33. Six plays and four
passes later wirighack Tom
Castles snagged a Copeland
aerial for a Grinnell touch-
down. Jack Shelter added the
extra point which knotted the
score. The TD capped a 53.
yard drive by the Pioneers.

The Pioneers’ offense posed
two fourth quarter scoring
threats which didn’t materialize.
One drive was halted when the
Siwash intercepted a pass on .the
two yard line. in the closing
moments of the game Crinneil
was knocking at the door again,
but a 15 yard penalty for oﬁem
sive pass interference nullified
Copeland’s ten yard scoring
strike to Castles, and the game
ended with Grinnell in posses-
sion of the ball on the Knox
26~yard line.
