The presentation oi
iips' "Nero" by the Chi-estornattrian
and Ellis Societies last irrgirt i'nlly
maintained the high standard or excel-
lence set by the best Grinnell dr nrrtie
per-iormances iii recent years. For stir-
dents to attempt a poetic tragedy
might well seem hazardous, and it is

throout and in parts wrtii much real
power. it is a cause ior much satise
iaction that together with plays which
express the higher aspects oi lile or-
deal with it in the tamiliar, modern,
way, we can sontetitires have one wlricii
gives the deeper, idealizing view pos
sible only wiien poetry is the medium
and people oi great place the charac
ters.

One main result tor the spectators,
oi a srrccessi'ul production of a play
like ”Nero" is the lrurnanization oi the
characters. Tire aver-age person
thinks or New merely as the ti ical
monster oi cruelty uitlr scarcely any

. red cming traits. For this impossible
idea ;\ r. Phillips, oi course, has given
us a real man. Mr. Young showed
unusual capacity to grasp and interpret
the conception. We were made to reel
throout that the normal good instincts
were not only present in the Emperor.

ones, and tiiat the man’s monstrous
crimes were the result not oi depravity.
but iii a deadening oi the sense oi
moral values produced by the temple
tions incident to almost absolute power.
working especially upon an exceptional
artistic imagination. The scene oi
the parting oi Nero and Agrippina was
representative and climactic in this as
well as in other respects. without
doubt, indeed, Mr. Phillips has treated
Nero with (historically speaking) too
much sympathy. The popular idea must
he as near the loot as is Mr. Phillips'
in his iourth act, But this does not
concern either this play as a piece at
art or Mr. Young’s acting, which was
sympathetic, ﬂexible, and ﬁnlslrt. His
enunciation was especiallv good and
did (llll justice to the poetry.

Equal praise rrttrst he awarded to
bliss Hasek as Agrippina. The char-
acter ia marrysided and subtle, but
Miss Hasek brot out distinctly and
truly all the phases, rrom human Lens
der-ncss to passionate contempt, and
with them the background oi the was
mall‘s nature, the inar-tlctiiatc complex
oi emotions and aim. in ease, spit .
iorce, and deliver .ii, l-iasek trowed
excellence intrch above the ordinary
amateur standard. in this case, in
deed, somewhat as in that oi ‘EI‘O,
entire realistic truth was neither to be
eipected nor to be desired. Tire un-
scrupuious cruelty or tiic woman was
not by any means lully expr-esst; but
it was srrtiiciently indicated.

Space is lacking ior more than bricl
mention oi other characters and mat»
tors. The part oi Follpaea is less mot
pounced, oi course, than that oi Age
rippina, and the traits are less varied.
o at least, lacking. The emphasis oi
nrperial power, do not stand out so
iotcibly. But Miss Grimm showed rto

s capacity to render the cllal'ncteri
taat oi the treacherous and heartlessly,
JIeen-witted scircmer. Her plausibility
and the nattiralness oi her transitions
in the scene with mm were worthy oi
especial mention. Mt. Blank as (mm
was strongia convincing embodiment
oi a Roman noble oi the better type.
The tour ministers or state 'even had
dignity and a good degree at iorce.

The Annual is out.

tioubtiess it is an unprecedented
breath of historic good form to lllzllte
mention at the tact so tersely. it
would he more in keeping with journal-
istic custom to say that, “At last, alter

ginning!

With regard to the cover, which is
always one olihedliast important Teak

is more than tip to the standard. There
was no attempt made CD Cal 3’ out at

has seen the book can say that this de-
par-ture was unwise. Tire dedication
ot the \olume to Prolessor Payne or
the History department meets the
hearty approval oi all. Prolessor-
Payne has won a place in the hearts
ot llre student body generally, and the
'illeven Board in their \Vellecllaseil

voice to the common sentinrent.

Grinnell
held on \Vard Field with a total or (58
points. llornim ide was second
with to, ace third with is), Cornell and
Normal 2, Penn, Leander Clark, and
Parsons iailed to take points.

The sensation ot the meet was the
sprinting oi Wilson oi Coe ubo took
ﬁrst iii the three dashes, deicatiug Tr -
her in the 220, taking that event in
ilat. Wilson easily proved himselt
the equal oi any ot the great sprint»
are that irave pcriorined on iowa
tracks ,and should with an even break
in luck take a number-oi points in the
Missouri Valley lieet. His work-
against Haddoclr of Kansas will be
watched with great interest alter the
periornrance oi yesterday.

The crowd that witnessed the meet

was the largest that errer came out ior_

an athletic event in Grinnell. The
new grandstand was comiortabiy ﬁlled,
white in automobiles around the ience
and on the old bleachers at the south
and oi 'the track tiiere were a large
number oi people.

The track was reasonably last, the
day tor the Meet was pertect, w
and comparatively still. The pin tes
tutnished a nrrnrber oi sensational
races and all voted the ﬁrst meet held
in Grinnell a success.

Wilson ot Coe was ﬁrst air the mark
in the 100 and led by a good margin at
the tape. Gill and Beers of Grinnell
had an easy time taking second and
third. Tire time was ten ﬂat.

in the high lrrrrdies Quanstroni oi
hiorningside ﬁnished ﬁrst, as ire also
did iii the low, taking the latter in the
last tiure at 25 4-5.

in the rrrlle rttn itierwin ot Cornell
surprised the motors by taking iirst
utter a desperate sprint up the ironic
stretch. Boyack had set the pace and
was unable to come back on the sprint
srtlticienlly to place. Tire time was
last, iii 24.

The ieatrire oi the ill) was the case
with which \Vilson took ﬁrst arid the
de. crate ﬁght between Shinstroru and
Be tstresser of blorningside tor llrird.

Altllo Wilson had won wltii ease in
the cerrlu dash and iti the 440, Grill-
nell supporters expclted that he untrld
meet his equal in Turner, but "Stunt"
was trot iir condition to run at ltis best
and it would take that to compete with
wilson on even terms so he had to be
content with a second. Gill scoretl air
easy tin d.

The ruile relay proved a sensational
event, Edsan running the tit-st lap

lor Grinnell gave his team-mate a good ,

load which uilli var, rig di. nnccs was
held until the last lap, Dan ins nlr
lowed the biorningsidc runner to cattle
up even with him but in the sprint
for the tape ontdistnuced his oppon-
ent and tool: ﬁrst for Grinnell.

in the hali-iuile relay 'l‘l'ilinel' Fisher
save some new inert a work out. M,
Clark loll otit ior Grinnell, Hutchins
tool: the second lap, Sparks ran third
and Ziegler almost ﬁnished. Needless
to say, the Grinnell team did not place,

The weights were zlll taken by Zoig-
ler. In the shot ilut Grinnell scal‘Pd
all three places. Tile jumps were not
at the usual caliber. Knowles took
the broad jump with a leap of 21 it 21,4,-
inches, Cross scored ﬁrst in the high
jump with 5 it 6 inches, while Fearing
cl Moriiiugside, took ﬁrst in the pole

won thc ﬁrst suite MeeL_

 

vault, nr 10 it 3 inches.

lieidt iir thc [homile r-un ran an
unusually plucky race tollowing Chair
man to the 220 mark where he sprinted
array ironr lllm. Heidt ﬁnished an
easy second.

Tire only thing to irrar the meet irom
a Grinnell standpoint was the rather
ragged appearance ot some oi the men
on the track Last year the Register
and Leader said that the Grinnell team
put up the neatest appearance oi any
team that had ever appeared in Des
ilioincs. It is not possible to ﬁt the
team with suits again this year but it
is possible tor the men to appear in
clean suits that bear soiue resemblance
to each other.

The ﬁrst State Meet held in Grinnell
was an unqualiﬁed success and a (zone
tiiittance at that event will mean much
ior athletics in Grinnell and the other
colleges oi the state.
