From Sacred COW to
An Ecofeminist Perspective on Mad I

by Bruce Friedrich

Carol Adams began her talk on
mad cow (llSL‘LISE by asserting that
“What we eat inﬂuences uur spiritib
aim: and our spirituality inﬂuences
what we cal, . Soul, diet, and health
are inrenlepelidcnr." Accniding to
Adams, an €CO»{CI\1||\IS[ perspectli‘e
on mad coii disease necessarily rec»
ognises and addresses rlie enrlre “st
rriarehal economy and society.”

“We move (ram being reininisrs
toecoieminists.“Adamssaid,"when
we see and understand that womenl
the environment, and ﬂnﬂnﬂls, are
all negauvely inlpacred in direcr and
significant ways by our patriarchal
culture ”

Adams explained that the cul»
rural coin has (“'0 sides: On one Side,
we find men, whites, srraighrs, and
meat eaters, On ihc other side, we
rind women, people or color, gays
and lesbians (and bisexuals), ziiicl ve-
gans (and vegetarians) Those ol’us

that homosexuals. people of color,

attention to patriarchal oppression,
vegans are considered offensive and
pushy for bringing up issues oranimal

According to Adams, our cul—
