to Des Momes will be the largest band
in the world. It has long been the
famous composer's boast that he con-
ducted the largest band on the globe,

will have the largest hand.

The Women’s club plans to make the
band available to as many persons as

a large section of the Coliseum and
have lowered the prices to the limit
to meet expenses. The price scale
ranges from 75 cents to $2, with a good
supply of exceptionally ﬁne seats for
a band concert at $1 each. The seats
are now being reserved for mail orders.

It’s a Long Road that

, Mudl A commonplace thingl But
‘whltt daredevil deeds and wonderful
adventures may come from it! Its pos—

if mud brings you up against Gypsies
who turn down Camels and arrogantly

count of a little mud. you are a man

The eight Langan Hallites who ex-.
perienced all these things decided to‘
see the Missoul‘irGrinnell game for
themselves. The road was ﬁne—for
twelve miles, and then they met mud~

muddier. Local showers were falling

cided that only by driving all night
and all foreneon could they reach Co-
iumbia for the game. They plowed on
and achieved iust seventeen miles in
two muddy hours. At last another
car compelled them to turn out, but
their car did not stop with turning‘
out—it slid gently across the muddy.
read and dropped into a muddier
‘ditch—at one o'clock in the morning.

‘on all the lights and played blackjack
until 3:30 a. in. Then they slept—-
lsomewllat.

Next morning, by favoring a farmer
with ﬁve dollars, they persuaded him‘
to pull them out. They turned their
faces homeward without ever teeling
the mud of Missouri; even Iowa mud
was too much for them.

Having plowed through more miles
of mud, which had been thoroughly
moistened by more local showers,
they arrived in Grlnrlell just in time to
get the results of the game—by wire.

Thus endeth the Tale of the Mod
and the Eight Muddy Ones.

lowed by an enthusiastic talk by Miss
Curran, in which she stressed the
value of unilied youth and tbc things
that it can accomplish. “What can
we do about the problems which are
racing the world today, We who are
in having a ’Christian
World? Christian living does away
with all these things"
