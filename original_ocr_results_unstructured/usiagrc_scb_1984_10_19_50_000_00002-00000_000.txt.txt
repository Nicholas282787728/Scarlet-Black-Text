the economy-

that’s bullshit.”
- Dr. Helen Caldioott

false alarm occurs, they have icur
minutes to decide if it's real and
stop the ﬁring of actual weapons "

“We're all committing suicide,"
she said. “Reagan is like Jim
Jones leading us to the Kool-Aid
vats. We are going through manic
denial."

Caldicott also stressed the ims
portance oi the November elec-
tion.

“This is the most important
election in your life.” she said.
“Everyone says this election is
about the economy — that's
bullshit. Reagan has said 11 times
that he believes Armageddon will
happen in our generation"

She read a telegram that
presidential candidate Walter
Mondale sent for the rally. The
telegram said that Oct. 13 was
designated freeze day in the Mon-
dale/Ferraro campaign.

Other speakers included
Swedish Ambassador Britt
Theorin and nuclear freeze move~
merit founder, Randall r‘osberg.

Grinnell participant Rink
DaVee said the rally was pro
Mondale,

“The emphasis of the rallywas
that people who ieel strongly
about ireezing weapons. meeting
human needs and preventing Ins
vaSionS should vote for Mondale."

Schaefer said she wished the
rally hadn‘t been so anti-lteagan

”I would have rather seen more
pDSitive things said about Mons
dale instead oi negative unngs
about Reagan," she said.
