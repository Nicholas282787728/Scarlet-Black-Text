The other day the Science club
decided to hold a picnic and asked
Ellct Drake, who is a responsible
psi-son in that organization, to
make the necessary arrangements.
Drake decided that Westneldwould
be a nice place if he only knew
where it was. An exploring expe-
dition set forth, led by the intro-
pid Eliot and the triumphant re-
discovery of Westficld was soon an
accomplished fact. How that boy,
Drake, must get around.

ball was intercepted by Helgcson,
who was tackled behind the goal-
line, counting as a touchback; not
a safety. The game ended with Jule
ius Bauer heaving his arm off in a
gallant effort to place a 40-yard
pass in the hands of a Grinnell re-
ceiver. All of the attempts were
either Wild, or knocked down.

Despite the Outcome, Coach Watt’ti
men outgained Johnny Baker's
shifty eleven 329 yards to 128,
made 15 first downs to the Visitors'
five, and outfought them in line
play. On three occasions the Pio-
nears placed the ball within the 10-
yard stripe, only to lose it on downs
or fumbles.

Kingery Stars

Kingery, although weighing only
140 pounds, and standing but 5 feet
7 inches, was easily the most out-
standing man On the field. His re-
peated gains off-tackle and through
center, were cleverly executed with
pivots and twists.

Rose lived up to all the hard-bib
ting tactics that Ossie Salem has
accredited him with, accounting for
several large gains through the line.
and starring on the receiving end of
Kingexy’s passes. Vic Fini played
the best game of his career, plunging
time and again for gains.

Gould, Morgan Loom

Bob Mbrgan and Captain Gould
shared honors on the line. Morgan
broke through on several occasions
to smear the opposing runners be»
fore the play had materialized, and
on line smashes his huge bulk Served
as an impenetrable barrier. Gould
