Butler’s out, Barkley’s in

Convocation speakers change after students demand that former NBA star Charles Bark-
ley, an ”amateur feminist theorist,” replace professional feminist philosopherJudith Butler

Bv PAT CALDWELL 8t. DAVID LOGAN

At an emergency Monday meeting, the
Commencement Committee voted to re-
placc eminent feminist philosopher Judith
Butler with former NBA player and current
TV analyst Charles “Round Mound of Rep
bound” Barkley as the headline speaker for
this year's commencement services.

The rneermg and deci-
sion came after a growing

and political philosophy, Butler herself saw
the decision to depose her as illustrative of
much of her scholarship, saying:

“This decision is a clear representlttiou of
the communicative dialectic ilnd its discursive
ontological deprivation of agency in a criti-
cal neorpostrfeminisr public sphere as well as
its elocurionary force on the obfuscation of
a formalist conception of

Fcrrier, a longtime
admirer of the former

to campus was driven by his appreciation of
Barkley’s unique perspective. -

“Eventually it just dawned on meihe's a
very ambitious man," Perrier said. “While he
may not seem like it, he's a very smart man,
an articulate man with a lot of things to say
and not afraid to say it, for ckamplc, when
he called conservatives ‘frike Christians.’ I
feel like that was a bold and possibly truthful

In addition to these works, Barkley in his
spare time also addresses Butler’s topic of
philosophy, “People don't know this—but he
is an amateur feminist theorist,” said Perrier.
“He could also make up for a lot of what his
dith Butler would say.”

In his commencement speech, Bark-
ley can address the specific topic of college
graduation.

“As someone who I don't think actually

he would give insight onto the importance
of a college education," said Ferrier. “Even
though he's become fabulously wealthy withr
outonc,"

some student groups have reacted nega-
tivcly to the change in the commencement
speaker

Tim Hedcrmau ’09, a member of Femis
nist Action Coalition (PAC). lamented the
decision simply by saying. “This is one giant
icip backwards for critical gendcr theory."

Critics ofthe change have also refeleneed
Barkiey’s past as~evidcncu that his experi‘
ences may not appeal to Grinncll students.
They pointed to an incident during a 1991
gamc when he spar into the ciowtl, hitting a
young girl.

Howevel. some students believe that this
incident was merely a misunderstanding and
could represent Grinnell’s policies. “I would
say you think otrhat as violence," said Fere
tier. “1 think of that as sclfrexpression and,
darc i say, sclfrgovernancc."

Talk has already begun of potential folr
low-ups to Barkley for ncxtysur’s commences
merit speech. Perrier mentioned a potential
push to bring forrucr searrle Supersonics star
dunkcr Shawn ”The Rainman" Kemp.

While Grinnell students may not be able
to relate to Kemps position as a father of 13
children, his insights on drug use after arrest
and rchab may be otuse to some students.

The Grinnell police department arrested

police confiscated two pounds otcociine.

The apprehended have been released on

attained a new supply of snow. “Everybody
knew about it," the third»year said. “And once
they got busted, they stopped dealing, Obvir
ously, that kind of thing would mess up their

The Cocos seem to have been the main
source of premium powder for campus, and
their stash was supposed to “make Disco ball,"
a Disco XIX organizer said,

There remain dealers on campus, said co—
caine user Alex Wolf’IO. However, he claims
there will not be enough white powder to
supply the peak Disco demand this weekend.
“Most Grinnellidns who use co-co do it but
once a year," Wolf said. “So the Loco Coco's
supply was key to a great disco."
