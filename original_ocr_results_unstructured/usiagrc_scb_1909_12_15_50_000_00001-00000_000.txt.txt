fitting

the account ol the musical event oi
Sunday afternoon is chronicled. Tili’

yEar’s effort must he considered as a
whole the best rendition of the Messiah
el'er given in Grinnell.

it Was thru his long efforts extend-
ing over many weeks, and thru his
superior ability in directing so intri-
cate a combination of Voices and me
strunieuts tllat such a success was pas
sihle of attainment.

There were of course some minor
disappointments as is always the case.
Many of us who linile heard Edward
Strong in previous years, regretted that
he was unable to lend his heailtitui
tenor \‘aice til the intei'pletatlon of
Handel's picturesque solos; also “Vilr
lian] Olds’ Voice, altllo rich and pleas-
ing, was lacking in puller, and seemed
inadequate to the demands made upon
the lower tones.

But aside from this, little advei‘s
criticism can be oflei'ed. This year's
Chorus Was wonderfully effective,
which was due probably to their fair
miliarity with the music from last
year, and to the presence of the entire
membership of the Glee Clubs. The
attacks were made with greater cer-
tainty, and there was for the first time
that wildness of tone which some of
the choruses demand, Thrnont the
chorus there seemed to he a. feeling of
confidence that was absent in years
past.

The accompaniment by the string
orchestrLadded immensely to the in
terprelation of the Oratorio. In such
numbers as the Pastoralsymphony.
and “Why do the Nations" the stringed
instruments produce an effect thiit is
not possible with the organ and piano
aloner Tile symphony was superbly
played. To the musical mind it nor-
trayed a vivid picture of the quivering
world awaiting breathlessiy the birth
of the Messiah.

As a recognition of their artistic an
campanin‘lents on the piano and organ.
mention nlust be made of the no small
part which Mrs. Pierce and Professor
Matllick contributed to the perform
once,

It is most pleasant to recall the ’rll‘
tistic Work of the lady soloi s, Jell-
nie E w. Johnson executed the cor.
tl'alto parts with dignity and power
Her voice is unusually strong and EVE“
thru a wide range of tone.

Altho she dues not possess the coma

ger Gannon of last year, still M

iaiactory.

It remained, huwever, for Helen Aha
bott, the soprano, to win the highest
favor from the immense audience, Iler
clear, ringing voice lll'led the entire
chapel With its rich tones, and left
little to he desired.

With each succeeding rendition of
the Messiah, Crinnell people have
learned to love it more, and it seems
to be the general wish that it be re-
peated at each re'currlng Christmas
season.

Washhurh College at Topeka, Kam
gas, is anxious to gain admission to
the Missouri Valley Conference.

The Athletic Board of Control at
Iowa is the subject of quite serious
criticism at the present time.

 

7 RECITAl.

Ky ,ilivs Johnson. lio Sully lilo ('oii»
lidllo Part in the
Messiah,

Not the least enjciitble oi the wccl: s
musical events was the iulorltml rer
vital given Monday afternoon hy ’
Johnson, who rendered the coutl lto
soles of the Messiah on Sunday.

By her gracious informal manner of
presenting her songs, She put. her hcdi»
el-s ill it lnost happy mood and lured
them almost unconsciously to the [ill]
appreciation of 1161‘ splendid voicc.

Her selections were all rendered iv
English, and were of that class of mu-
sic that an audience cannot. but love.
Among the best of her numbers were
”Songs My Mother Taught Me," and
Grieg's weirdly beautiful "Cradle
Song." Miss Johnson Was encored
again and again and each time she rer
spouded with a selection mare delight-
lul if possible than the one preceding
it.

Mrs. Pierce played the piano sceolnr
pallimeltts in her usual charming Diana
hcr.

Should Miss Johnson return to G. r
hell in the future, she will certuihl,
find a Warm weloonle awaiting her-
from those who heard by Monday,

At

Chapel this morning, a new Song, hotll
music and words written by Nirman
Hall, ’10, was rendered. After the era
chestra and the Glee Clubs had ployed
it a few times, a chart having the
words oi the rim verse was uurolled,
and the entire student body joined in
singing it,

The song made a favorable impresV
sion, for it has that distinctive charm
and rhythm which characterizes roost
successful college songs. Both by the
music and the words, Mr. Hall proved
himscli a real Creative artist. The
words are as follow ;

“Sons of old Gl‘llnwll."

FO0I§ALL

Played iii Several Different
Ways

unnbrn Hill/bl], Soccer and dolor-loan
Games Most Pop
"Man

In view of the agitation relative to
the American game of football the
Scarlet and Black has asked some in
a position to lmow, about some of the
other forms than our own game to
make a statement as tn the essential
features in each of the three games,
Soccer, English rtugby and American
football.

The nmericon college game is known
of course by every college man in the
country. The essential lecture of this
game are the use of interleronce in mi»
vnnoing the ball. the possession of the
llitll by one of the two contending
teams as long as they can make the re
qulrcd distance and the element or
bodily Contact which as it hos devel-
oped, is responsible for the large nums
her of injuries attendant upon the
American game.

English Rugby is essentially the
game tllilt was played in the American
colleges twenty years ago and from
which the present game has evolved.
lt is characterized by the nbseuce of
interference and of definite formations
to execute the plays. Each time the
ball is stopped in its forward progress
or is a “down" is made as it is called
in the American game, each team has
the privilege at contending for its pus.
session hetorc it goes into ploy again.
in the English Rugby game all of tho
backtield must be good kickers, all
printing is one of the chief means or
advancing the hall. The interest on
the part oi hoth player and sputum-
is not is intense as in the Ameripnn
game. English Rugby as it is played
now is comparatively lree irom injur-
ies and serious accidents seldom occur.

The Association or Soccer game dil-
far: from the other two described in
being more of is kicking game. Eleven
men play on a side and the ball is ad-
Vaneed by kicking or striking it with
the knees. chest or head. Soccer re
quires shill, cleverness and head work
and is a much raster game than either
of the other two in all three games
the liold is practically the same length
and the number ol’ players on a team
is the same. Both the Soccer and Eng-
lish ltugbv games have this to cum-
mend them. A lcrger number or men
are able to play the game successiully,
as the physicnl requirement is not as
great as in tho American game.

Thrunnt England the Rugby gum is
very popular and immense crowds
come out to see the big contests, In
Cilnzlfla and the east the Soccer or As.
sociatimi some is rapidly gaining in
favor. it is a game requiring all a:
the essential qualities of football, mak-
ing at the same time iur less demands
upon the players in time and strength.
it is a game that can he succeselully
played after a men has completed his
college work, so is of service in a way
that the American college game can
never be.

College Calendar for 1910 will be
mailed to olumnl lronu the College ut-
ilce on receipt of 25 cents.

The championship basketball game
between the Juniors and Sophomores,
which was scheduled ior 7:30 Thaw
doy evening, will be played at 5 9.111.
