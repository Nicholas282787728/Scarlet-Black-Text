QEhitorral

DURING Tl-Ir: past year, the exper
ment has been tried or liolding‘thc litr
erary sessions of Grinnell Institute on
Wednesday evening instead of on Sat
urday, as formerly. The results
have been most marked. An increase
in membership and a good steady at-
tendance at the weekly meetings are
not the only noticeable improvements.
The general grade of work done has
been higher than ever before, and the
experiment was considered a suce
But the faculty apparently viewed the
matter from a ditl'ereut standpoint.
The poor work of Thursday mornings
was directly attributed to the meetings
of the night before; and, ill conse
quence of this view, the permission
given to the society a year ago, was
withdrawn. This action was not on-
ly a surprise, bllt a disappointment.

attendance and quality of work has
been maintained. Saturday evening
seems peculiarly unﬁt tor literary
work. During the fall and spring
terms, athletic affairs unavoidably ab-
sorb the interest of a part oftlre mem-
bers, and during the winter, social dlr-
ties exert some claim upon the stir»
dents’ time. These appear, perhaps,
as very artiﬁcial arguments when com-
pared with the supremely more ilnr
portant work of debate and oration.
But they are, nevertheless, elements
which mrrst be recognized in college
life. Saturday evening sessions can
not be as successful as those now in
vogue. In view of these facts, the
Institute has ,made hold to present an
other petition to the family, to the
eﬁect that the present scheme may
continue. It is hoped the faculty will

Institut .

The regular meeting of the Grinnell
Institute was called to order by Presi-
dent Lindsay, The programme was
interesting throughout, and showed
good, conscientious work on the part
of those who participated.

It was opened by Strauss, who read
an instructive paper elititled,“A News»
paper Oﬁice at Night.”

Engelke followed with a wellrder
liveled presidential nomination speech.
Admiral Dewey was his candidate.

The music of the evening, which is
always a pleasant part of the pro-
gramme, was furnished by Mr. Cline.
He kindly responded to all encore,

The externporanoous work was
given by Blatherwick and Swan. Both
numbers were of unusual excellence.

Blatllerwick spoke on “The l’ostal
Frauds ill Cuba,” giving two probable
causes; one the selling of stamps or-
dered to be cancelled, and the other
the falsifying of accounts, the latter
being the more probable cause.

Swan spoke on recent strikes, their
causes and results. He said they
were a sort of epidemic at present and
some solution on the proﬁt-sharing
basis mrrst be found to abolish them.

The debate of the evening was:
“Resolved, That every city of 8,000
inhabitants or more should furnish a
system of employment for its depeildr
ents."

In the absence of Smith, Davis
spoke extenlpor'aneorlsly on the aﬁirmr
ativc and Sheppa l upheld the nega-
tive. Since Davis had but five lnin-
iltcs preparation no judges were ap-
pointed.

After the business meeting, in which
Mr, Cliley was admitted into the
membership of the Grinnell Institute,
the society adjourned
