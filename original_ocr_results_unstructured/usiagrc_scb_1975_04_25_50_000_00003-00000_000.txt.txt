ii the seemingly ill-rated Rock Island
Railroad is iinally iorced into oblivion, at
least its role in Iowa’s history won’t go
unrecorded. Thanks to the eiiorts oi Stephen
E. La Rocque, Assistant in College
Relations and Coordinator oi the College’s
video Services, and a collection of technical
assistants, production oi a color, video
history oi the ChicagoVRock island-Pacific
Railroad is now nearing completion.

The haltrhour documentary is the tirst oi
its kind to be produced by Video Services,
and was developed as an Iowa Folk Lite
project ionded jointly by both Iowa Folk
Lite and Video Services, La Rocque, who
directed and iilmed the program, says it
was initially conceived with the hope oi
producing an “airable product.” All in
dications are that it will be exactly that,

“Nostalgia” is the key word in charace
terizing the production, according to La
Racque. The oroiect was designed to record
the history oi the Rock Island: rail and
passenger services, irom the Line's early
days as the Mississippi and Missouri
Railroad to the present, In creating the

programipart oi which was lilmcd aboard
one of the Railroad’s last two surviving
passenger trains, the Quad City Rocket—
crcw and equipment travelled to the tar
reaches of town, capturing scenery and
sentiment along the Rock island's main
routes.

The result of extensive planning and
research which began in midvFebruary, the
final product will combine a comparison oi
the Railroad's past. and present services.
interviews with Rock island employee54
dining car waiters. engineers, and the
Director oi Passenger Services-Clips
irom a 1952 tilm involving the Rock island,
and even what La Rocque terms some
“vintage music” in the background. The
documentary will also explore the future of
the Rock Island Railroad as perceived by
Company oilicials and workers, and by
historiansinotably Grinnell College
Professor Alan Jones.

Time and money were critical iactors in
the undertaking. as production required the
rental oi sophisticated video equipment not
owned by the college, Filming was come

pleted in one week, and editing in one day7
no time tor the producers to lose any con-
tinuity in the tone or mood oi the program.
Credit for the tinal production goes to
several individuals: Kevin L. prim. writer;
Alan R. Yordy, sound technician; Theater
Lecturer Rarl Harshbarger, narrator;
nalph Gifford, assistant cirector; Joe
Finder and Ellis D. Gordon, still
photography.

The program deals with a timely subject
ior Iowans, and La Rocque is coniident that
the end result will be of airable quality.
Although no deiinite plans have yet been
made, several networks have expressed an
interest in broadcasting the documentary
and, ideally, arrangements can be made to
have it shown throughout the state of Iowa.

Regardless oi whether and when the
program is televised, the Grinnell College
community will have an opportunity to view
it sometime after its release next
week..,.stion it may be the last chance
anyone will have to witness the Rock Island

Railroad in action.
