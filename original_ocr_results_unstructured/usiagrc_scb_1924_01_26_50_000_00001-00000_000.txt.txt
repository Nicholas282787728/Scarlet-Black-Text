Moran Is Sensation of The Game
While Prelim, Doffing And
Hays Play Well.

In an impromptu game yesterday Elf-

tel'noan, the second string varsity de-

feated the strong freshman squad, is
to 29.

This was the first time since the
class series that outsiders have had
zl. chance to see the preps in action.
The first year men have a well lhal-
anced team, including many promising
men who will make good varsity mas
terial in another year. Doffing at
forward. Larson at center, and Hays
at running guard are the best bets, but
Stoits, guard, Gates, Chase, and you
Scbrader, forwards, and Nible, center,
are all men of noticeable ability. .

The second varsity team was reins
forced by Moran and Taylor, and had
no difficulty keeping ahead of the
preps during the entire scrimmage.
Moran especially, was the star of the
game, caging ten baskets from the
field. His pivoting, dribbling, and
passing , marked him as the best man
on the floor. 1=rehm also made several
sensational shots With his famous left
handienglish.

PRESIDENT PDTNTS Tl]

Stresses Educational Value of

Chapel1 Vespers, and Self-
Government.

"‘Callege is a thinking shop”, deg
in
chapel Thursday morning. "It is where
men and women shall come to have
clear vision and understanding under

claret] President J. H. T. Main

conditions of sympathetic guidencc
and freedom.”

Elaborating on the principle of free-

dam. in college work, President Main
cited the narrowness 0: two state uni-

versities that attempted to “suppress
independent thinking."
Lion baited Robinson's Mind in the
Making”, a book used for collateral
reading at Grinnel, from its reference
shelves.

Another refused to give audience to
a proponent of the league of nations
because he spoke on a “political mat-
ter." This attitude, according to Mr.
Main, defeats the purpose of the col-
lege, which is to inform and to broaden
its sfudents.
Freedom und (Jo-Operation.

“Read dangerous books, but do not
necessarily accept them," he urged
his chapel audience. He went on to
point out that college is a place where
the student must charge his batteries
with the energy of individual responsl~
blllty and initiative.

Declaring that the great spiritual
and educational fact of. Grinnell is the
principle of freedom in the atmosphere
of co—operatlon, he stressed the point
that the obligations of freedom are
even greater than the obligations of
compulsion. Student govemment, vol-
unmy chapel, and voluntary yespers
were singled out as the three phases
of our college life, outside the class-
room, whlch should contribute most to
this principle of freedom.
