A LOAD OFF OUR MINDS

We are happy to see that nine fresh-
men finally got around to entering the Stein-
er song contest competition, for the problem
of student apathy indicated by the dearth of
entries was beginning to weigh on us pretty
heavily.

Now, it seems, as it always does when
we are concerned about something, that we
need not have worried Nine entries have

I been made and a decision as to the best song
will be forthcoming within the next week.
We still can’t entirely forget that the con.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

test was twice postponed because no entries

had been submitted. Whatever the cause of

such laxness, may we hope that those who

next year will be eligible for the colltest will

take to heart the example of those who al-

most didn’t get in on the contest this year.

WATCHING AND WAITING

All the world this week is watching in—
tently for results of the meeting in Rome,
Italy, between Premiers Benito Mussolini
and Adolph Hitler. What they are discussing,
only they know What their conversation
may mean to the fate of Europe, all the
world knows.

It is understood that Mussolini has
promised Hitler that he will not interfere in
Germany’s plans regarding the status of
Czechoslovakia. What these plans are, is
still indefinite. At any rate, it seems certain
that the Rome-Berlin axis will be stronger
as a result of this conference

At the some time, it must be remem»
bered that Italy and England have only re—
cently taken steps to cement their newly
formed friendship. Does this then mean
that England will look with favor, or at any
rate ignore further German aggression, so
long as it is eastward?

It is an interesting question, one to
which no one knows the answer; yet, one
which is of paramount importance to Eue
rope.

So, we shall watch and wait.

CONGRATULATIONS!

It is not every week that we witness
the awarding of as many honors as we have
this week, nor is it often that we are so well
satisfied with the choice of winners.

We refer, of course, to the awarding of
Phi Beta Kappa shingles, and the double
honors conferred by the Friars, senior men’s
honorary scholastic society, in honoring out-
standing freshmen as well as men selected
for membership in the organization

We particularly feel that special men-
tion should be made on the inauguration of
freshman honor awards by the Friars. Such
awards are a fine expression of the best
purposes of the organization, for by the very
virtue of their being, such awards will pro-
vide an important incentive to entering stu-
dents.

Such an incentive, coming as it does to
men about to complete their freshman year
and embark on a new career as upperclass.

men, may well be the means to the develop-‘

ment of students who will do much for Gun-
nell by their leadership.

JERSEY CITY, N. .I—Mayur
Frank Hague of this city, Amer-
ica's Hitler, is in the news again
this week as a result of actions
which caused Representative Ber»
hard of Minnesota to ask the
Department of State whether a
passport is needed for entrance
to Jersey City and whether the
United states would extend the
same protection to American
citizens there as it would to those
in other countries over the world.

The present controversy arises
from threats of physical violence
made to Bernard and Representa-

Friday in defiance of Mayor
Hague's orders.
