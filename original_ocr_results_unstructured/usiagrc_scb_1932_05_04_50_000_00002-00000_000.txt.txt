SCHOLARS AS GOOD AS MUSICIANS

TheI Illusit'lns have a test which is llettel‘

sight-reading. Sight-reading does not test whether
or not the scholar has reviewed his notes of No

It is a harder test. It shows whether or not

WE HAVE FAILED To BE LEADERS
(From The Croiglitoiriun)

The recent student uprising in various universities
in the country over strident elections which culminated
in the stealing of ballot boxes and the throwing of acid
in one university and serious shooting frays in another,
have caused the American public to look to the students
for an explanation. It is not b to explain why uni-
versity students have resorted to such tactics. The
commonplace racketeering measures employed by pro»
fessional politicians in government have finally perrneat»
ed the university as it corrld he expected to do. college
students have long ago ceased to be originators and have
very sublimcly settled to a position of followers and lini-
tators.

In many cases the university elections over which a
row is raised do not amount to anything. The reason
that the students become uncontrollable and unruly is
because they think it is smart to imitate a gang of cheap
racketeering politicians. It is a sad state of affairs but
it seems to be true. The American college man has
ceased to be a manihe has turned to become the fol-
lower of the type which should be led.

Undaunted by the growing belief that university stu-
dents are not fit to govern themselves, universities have
continually allowed student groups to assume petty pow-
ers which one good person could easily and satisfactorily
manage. In the universities we see a hoard of 10 to 20
students trying to manage student affairs when one
person could easily handle them. It has left loom for
inter-group haggling and quarreling resulting in shame-
ful demonstrations such as have been apparent in the
last few days. Universities would do well to abolish all
forms of student governing until the students have
learned to govern themselves. The university should be
a place where proper training in government is me
culcatcd and not where students are train it in the ways
of the professional and under world pol ans. Dissolu—
tion may not be the most ideal way of handling the situ-
ation but it is the quickest and surest. students were
thought to be capable of conducting democratic govern
ment but they have been released too soon—they
have failed in the duty entrusted to them. They should
be turned back to the classroom and taught the prin-
ciples of right living and the ways of God and not allow-
ed to absorb tliru a corrupt strident government, the ways
of racketeering men.

GETS HIS DUE
(From the Marquette Tribune)

The newspaper columnist. it seems, has come into
his own if this fact may be derived from the salaries
paid to the various literary lights by publishers of the
better known papers. Walter Winchell, probably the
most famous columnist of this day. according to “Life,"
receives a salary of more than $3,000 a week for his
radio and writing activities while Mar-k Hollinger, tho
not as well known, is also amply paid for his pen Work.

Winchell, according to the article. is contemplating
retirement in a few years in order to spend his future
life in less profitable fields such as farming or golfing.
If pecuniary gain is the main desire of the future gen-
eration. proud fathers will rear their sons to become
columnists instead of assuming the duties of the presir
dency of the United states at a salary considerably
lower.

There also lies a tremendous difference between
the two activities as a columnist is paid to talk about
other people while the citizens of this country as a
whole talk about the president with no hope of reward
other than an outlet for their feelings. Which course to
follow will have to be decided by the future hopefuls,

different and often oppoem ,

Dear Sir.

Every night of the week a group
of Grinnell college men is set for
an enjoyable date with his own girl
or some other. The date is slated for
eight-thirty, let us say. The man is
late, In many cases, it is five minu-
tes before the girl comes down the
stairs. In more cases it is 10 to'
15 minutes before the girl shows
up Tire question is, how long should
a self respecting man wait for the
girl to make her appearance? Any
chivalrcus man will wait for an hour-
it' necessary.

Let us hope that we are all chival-
rous. On the other hand, is it the
square thing for the girls to be habit:

of the negative are inclined to think
not. Five minutes should be suffic-

outwardly pleasant, at man who has
