Latimer’s boys blistered

by Robert Mcyer

Last weekend Grinnell hosted
four teams in the North Central
Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association tournament, A strong
Western Illinois team won the
“batof three games" tournament;
Grinnell finished fourth.

Grinnell began play against
Tarkio, a Missouri school Tarkio.
who finished fifth, proved to be no
match for Grinnell. Alter blasting
them in the firstgame, Coach Tom
Latimer sent his JV squad into
action. This squad won the second
game which in turn gave Grinnell
its first and only victory for the
afternoon.

In their second match Grinnell
was shellshocked by the superb.
spiking of the Western Illinois
team. Grinnell, however, regained
their confidence and fought ex-
tremely close matches against
Missouri Western and Graceland.

Missouri Western beat Grinnell

in two games. 167” and 1543. As
these scores indicate, Grinnell was
narrowly defeated and many team
members believe that the match
could have easily ended with a
Grinnell victory. This victory
allowed MW to finish third.

Although Graceland couldn't
bring either their first or second
teams to Grinnell, their per
formance was outstanding
Graceland Ill won a close match
against the Pioneers which allowed
their team to finish second in the
tournament.

Tomorrow, Grinnell hosts a
USVBA tournament which will
include lwelve teams. There will
be two divisions. each consisting of
six teams, which will hold round
robin play starting at 8:30 am.
Later in the evening championship
play will be held which will match
the best scoring teams of each
division against one another.

Strong competition defeated Grinnell last weekend

by Dick Gilbert

They must have experienced a
big let down. After peaking for the
Miracles and then having to dodge
cars in their swimsuits and shoes
to reach the Iowa State pool. you
couldn't expect the Women's swim
team to swim exceptionally well.
And they didn't. .

In Ames last weekend. com-
peting in the AlAW State Meet, the
swimmers placed a disappointing
fourth behind Iowa, Iowa State,
and Luther. Iowa. one of the top
teams in the Big Ten, dominated
the meet by winning most of the

\ races. ISU, a respected Big Eight
squad, captured second place with
little or no pressure from any of the
other three teams. In the battle for
third, Luther barely squeaked by
the Pioneers. UNI finished a
distant last.

Debbie Jalowiec was Grinnell's
top performer, habbing second
place in both the 50 breast-stroke
and 100 breast-stroke. She nearly
qualified for Nationals in the 50;
missing the standard by less than
half a second. Becky Chip-

man swam her personal best in the
200 individual medley. Other fine
performances were turned in by
divers Renee Reichardt Johnson
and Carrie Bergfalk, and swim-
mers Margo Wessner. Sheryl
Huntoon, Lynn Westley, Grace
Morledge. Pauline Looye, and
Debbie Fleming.

Wednesday, traveling to Knox,
the Pioneers swam “a fun meet,"
according to Coach Peggy
Riedescl. Although only ten women
competed, the squad ravaged their

Women’s

opponents 7448.

Highlights of the meet included
fine efforts by Nancy DuTeau,
Ginny Munoz, Fleming, Christina
l Weinberg's first breaststroke race
of the year, and Johnson's stunning
diving victory. An exceptional
diver. Renee, in all likelihood, will
travel to Georgia to compete in the
National Meet.

Tuesday. the women conclude
their regular season with a meet
against Cornell at Mount Vernon

Grinnell grapplers grooming
Team fills all but one weight class

by Robert Meyer

Last Saturday the Pioneer
wrestling team competed in the
Knox Invitational in Galesburg, lll.
Grinnell finished ninth in the
twelve team meet.

Grinnell’s performance was
highlighted by co—captain Gordon
Stacey (134). Coach Stephan Moss
says Stacey looks great and
believes if he wrestles like he did at
Knox in next Saturday’s con
ference meet. Stacey will most
likely be conference champion, Ctr
captain David Greenwald (113)
was the only other Grinnell
grappler to place. He finished
fourth.

Wednesday Grinnell hosted
Loras College. In the first match
Greenwald hurt a rib in a turn
and was soon after pinned, Loras
grapplers continued to wrestle well
as they pinned four other Grinnell
grapplers. Loras won 36-15.

Grinnell‘s victories were won by
Stacey, Rich Corngan (ism, Jon
Christianson (190) and Paul Carter
(hvt.). Stacey showed poise as he
dominated most of the action in his

 

match and won 44,

Corrigan's performance pleased
Coach Moss the most. Corrigan.
who had earlier in the year last
to the same opponent by the score
of 7-2, overpowered the Loras
grappler and won 3-2.

Christianson. who actually
weighs 174, fought a heavier op
ponent and used his superior speed
and wrestling skills to earn a 40
victory. Carter won by a forfeit.

Grinnell grapplers continue to
improve The team, which in early
season action was forced to forfeit
at leastthree matches, now forfeits
only one match, Coach Moss, who
wrestled Christianson at 190,
believes that Christianson can
lower his weight another six
pounds and thus allow himself to
compete at 167. With this in mind.
Moss believes Grinnell can enter
the Midwest Conference Meetv
held here next Saturday, expecting
strong showmgs by Greenwald
(118), Stacey “34), Corrigan (158),
Christianson 1167) and Carter
(190).

The game against Luther was a
culmination of all previous efforts
and practices this year. Shooting
was on target with Sarah Brichford
scoring 20 points and Stephanie
Nelson scoring 18.

Coach Winkler was pleased with
the team's performance and
commented. “they played their
first complete game with continual
effort given by all the players."

The Pioneers played well
defensively, which proved
valuable in the tense final seconds.
Luther had the ball with twenty
seconds to go as Grinnell led by two
points. After a timeout by Luther,
the Pioneers pressed Luther with
their tenacious defense. Brichford,
Grinnell’s offensive star, did the
impossible by intercepting the
throwAin pass and quickly relaying
to Nelson, thus prevcnting Luther
from tying the game.

The next game. against Coe. did
not offer such a high level of play.
The play resembled that of the IM
league as there were fifty fouls and
continuous fast break situations.
Coe lost four players to fouls and
had only four players left on the
court for the final minutes of the
game,

The girls' shooting percentage
was not as high as it could have
been, but they did manage to
penetrate Coe's defense.

Nelson and Brichford, Grinnell’s
two top scorers, fouled out and left
the scoring responsibility to Kim
Kl‘utilla. Krutilla put in the
necessary points in the final
minutes by sinking two free throws
and putting Grinnell ahead to win.
