Read a hook and get oiit of your
rut. Then read number and stay out.

Arthur Brishaiie, editor or the chi-
cago l‘lel'nldrlljxéuuulel‘, was recently
questioned as to the best way to learn.
lie replied, “Read books, and read
them constantly."

Tile greatest thinkers of the world
hen/c heen the greatest rcadcrs, and
the gl'caLesL thinkers have been the
world's leaders.

No man who depends for his thin -
ing on what he 'rcad yesterday, letting
today's opportunities for learning slip

hy unhecded, c'an ever hope to he 21'

leader in this world of progress.

Don't depend on what you read a
year ago, or a month ago, or even yes-
terday to keep yourself ahrcast of
modern thought. What you read ycs-
tel-day may he true today, and then
again it may not. The world is
changing, Jollll Smith of today is
not precisely the same John Smith or
yesterday, and even you yourself may
have changed slightly, that is. it you
have employed your mental .iiowcrs in
the art of thinking.

it you are depending entirely on
Solllebody's Versmn or Something that
you read last yea , even Lho your rc-
flections are interspersed with one or
two thoughts of your own, your view-
point along that certain line will soon
become narrowed, if it has not al—
ready, mid you will sooner or later her
com a victim to that disease now so
prevalent, "mental near—sightednessx'

Use the library.

There's only one co’nsolatoin in this

rainy weather. The weeds are getting
a chance to grow, and that's an oppor-

A letter received yesterday ironi an
Ames man who can be considered rep~
resentative of tile eulli‘c student body
at Iowa State College contains the £017
lowing paragraph:

"Lei. me congratulate You and your
track team on their Victory last Satur-
day Over the Cyclone l'lmncrs.
a. clean sweep and we ﬁrmly believe
that the host team came thrll with {lye

ing colors."

One cannot help admiring such at

man and the spirit behind his state
ment. He shows the spirit of his
school by coming across with the glad
hand in defeat.

Here's to you, Amea

Granting that each man. woman
and faculty member in Grinnell col-
lege owns two pairs of shoes, approx-
imately 3200 shoes have hecn ruined

Never mind. if it rains long enough,

the boards will swell together.

Did you ever hear almut the man
who, upon waiting in the morning,
tound ﬁve two-hit pieces under his pil-

careless about his sleeping quarters,
so he bought Thrill: Stamps with the
