Man/Made Lightning

RANKLIN removed some of the mystery. But
only recently has science really explained the
electrical phenomena of the thunderstorm.

Dr. C. P. Steinmetz expounds this theory. Rain-
drops retain on their surfaces electrical charges,
given off by the sun and other incandescent bodies.
In falling, raindrops combine, but their surfaces do
not increase in proportion.
pressure grows rapidly, Finally it reaches the limit

Hence, the electrical

now we have artiﬁcial lightning, One million

volts of electricity—approximately one ﬁftieth of the
voltage in a lightning ﬂashihave been sent success-
fully over a transmission line in the General Engineer-
ing Laboratory of the General Electric Company.
This is nearly ﬁve times the voltage ever before

on a transmission line.

Manvmade lightning was the result of ungrudging
and patient experimentation by the same engineers
who ﬁrst sent 15,000 volts over a long distance
thirty years ago. '

“Keeping cverlastingly at it brings success.”
It is difﬁcult to forecast what the results of the next:
thirty years may be. '
