SPORTS ,

By Mux Hunn

Rain dampened the srdor of the
conference athletes yesterday and as
a result no records were even Serious-
ly engendered with the exception of
the 120-yard high hurdle mark, which,
however, was saved from oblivion by
a margin of six tenths of a second,
Phillips of Tulsa couldn‘t quite break
the 17 year old mark.

In incl the rain seems almost to
fissure the safety of the track
marks. nlthough it may not-be
of enough consequence to prevent
the setting of new records in the
lield events. Such records as the
mile relay time of 3.19.8 set in
1913, the high hurdles mark ol
514.6 dating from 1916 and the
low hurdles time of :23.5 set in the
same year Seem to Stand little
danger of destruction. Likewise,
the record of :48.‘ in the 440 seems
destined to remain in good condi-
tion. This mnrk was established
in 1914.

The field events may See some
marks tumbling especially with burly
Jim Tichenor of the Aggies heaving
the shot and tossing the discus. He
has turned in better marks in both
of these events, than the present Val—
ley mark, established in 1932 and 1926
respectively.

Intramural track is but a few days

senior honor society, ended sixty years
of complete secrecy, with a statement
in the Swarthrnore Phoenix, student
weekly.

"the statement abolished the tra-
ditional tap night ceremony forhthe
seven new members chosen each year.
In addition the abolition of many oth-
er customs, relics of the former “rah.
ra " days at Swarthmore, was an-
nounced because of considerable criti-
cism which had arisen on the \cam-
pus.

By adopting a course “more con.
sistent with the ideals of the organ-
ization and with the changing spirit
of the times," Book and Key hopes to
end campus criticism based on ignor-
ance of the society's true purposes and
a knowledge only of the ritualistic
customs. ,

College President Believes
Schools Becoming ‘Bookish’

Greenwich, Conn.rACP) —5chools
and. colleges are becoming “bookish"
and should “learn more about life and
its realities," Dr. Constance Warren,
president of Sarah Lawrence collcge,
stated here recently.

According to Dr. Warren, "training
of youth for family life is of great
importance in this chaotic age and al-
so in mutual relationship, since the
most valuable education comes Irom
a practical way of living."

“The colleges' objectives," she do.
clared, “must be the same as those of
life itself."

dents who are forced to earn their
way through college tend to excel both
in scholastic ability and achievement
those whose expenses are paid by par-
ents, according to a survey just com-
pleted at the University of Southern
California. .

comparisons were made between
Trojan students participating in the
Federal government's program of
part-time jobs for college men and
women and those who were not en.
gaged in s. E. rt. A. projects. From
data secured from freshman scholastic
aptitude besLs it was found that s, E
R. A. students made an average score
in the tests of 72.12 as compared to
70.53 for the non-S. E. R. A. students
and the first group was less variable
in the extreme scores,

During the first semester of the
1934.35 school year scholastic achieve-
ment records of 424 S. E. R, A. stu-
dents revealed that as a group they
surpassed by 39 percent of the range
between the marks of c and E a group
of 498 non-S. E. R. A, students se—
lected at random.

“It seems reasonable to conclude
that the significant difference between
the scholastic performances of the two
groups is not to be accounted for by
the small difference in their schol-
astic aptitudes but. rather by the
greater earnestness of purpose which
prevails in the group of s. E. R, A.
workers,” Dr. F. C.Touton,vice-presi-
dent of the university, declared.

Metropolitan Opera Star
Approves of Jazz Music

State College, Pa.—(ACP)—“There is
no danger that the taste for jazz will
kill on appreciation for the opera and
the classics," Crete Stueckgold,"l'dctro-
politan Opera Company prirna donna,
declared in an interview while ap-
pearing in recital at the Pennsylvania
State college.

“I like jazz very much myself,” she
continued, “and always include some
popular numbers on my radio pro.
grams. Because i sing them in a
simple manner, like classical music,
because I don’t ‘croonl them, people
tell me that the music is ‘so diiferent'
and that they enjoy it so much more.
1 think there is a great future in jazz."

The negro style of jazz, according
to Miss Stueckgold, does not have
much of a future, but the symphonic
style, as written by George Gershwin
and others, is real music. “It has
rhythm and melody,” she explained,
“and is an important contribution to
music.
