Dining Srmirtl P/Jx'l crooner swipe: at lludzliz’l Pacino daring Saturday [km a» Mar/R

January 30, 2009

AARON BARKER

Saturday afternoon with Phil Gibbons

uvjr FRANCIS Bust:

During the week, students rush into and out of meals in
the dining hall, herded through as quickly as possible by the
efﬁcient register workers, more commonly known as Cheery
Checkers. For those who consume rhe majority of their meals
in the dining hall, the faces of Cheery Checkers are as familiar
as those ofclassmales or old family friends.

Buton Saturdaysinrheslow-movinglimbobetweenmorns
ing and afternoon, students
invariably run into a face and
namestaginot to mention
conversation and exceptiorr
nlly slow Pecard swipingi
rarely encountered during the
week. “He’s always really ins
reresred in what you're doing
even though we haven’t done
a lot because us. Saturday
morning," said Maya Ruiz-Stanlmry ’11. “i like Phil. He has
a nice polo," ,

Phil Gibbons, known to some students as “Slow Swipe
Phil," is something of an unomuly us a Cheeiy Checker. His
excessively slow swipe seems to raise the question of whether
the crucial art of efﬁciency is fully lost to him. His initiation
of conversation on Saturday morning, as the weary masses be-
grudgingly drag themselves towards chccseburgcr pizza. might
seem in Vain to the casual observer.

still, Gibbons continues to maximize his speaking time
with students, becoming the face ofSimIrdin afternoons in the
same way rbar Director or Seculity Stephen Briscoe is to icy
mornings or Dick Clark is to New Year's Eve. “I enjoy meet-
ing the smdents, talking with them when I cun,"Gibbons said.
“When you're busy you can't do much more than just say how's
it going? How was break.> How was your week?"

Gibbons began working with Dining Services only five
years ago, originally as a checker at Cowles Dining Hall, prior
to the construction ofthejRC. Gibbons has noted a difference
in smdents’ Saturday morning attitudes since the consolidation
ofdining services.

“Back in those days, probably 50 percent or[students] rbar
came in had somc form ofplijilmil attire,"Gibbons said. ”Maybe
now you might see, oh 1 don't know, I might be stretching it to
say 25 percent.”

Still, in the face of tired and sometimes cranky smdenrs,
Gibbons entries on with conversation. Gibbons said it is 0 rar-
ity to come across students who are dismissive othis elongated
greetings.

“I think [hilt it's no different than if] were out milking
down the street saying hello to people," Gibbons said. “The
vast majority [ofstudcnts] are very responsive, and some mnybc

Bur when I have to
swipe fast, /’m pretty
fail.”

don’t have much to say. Still, you can tell they appreciate some
one saying hello.“

Gibbons, remarking that the nickname “SlOW’SWipC Phil"
is accurate, said that his lethargic method is not due to a lack
of agility or strength, but is instead a Chosen practice. “1 try
to spend time visiting with the students," Gibbons said. "But
when l have to swipe fast, I’m pretty fast."

In addition to his three-hour stints as "CulHn Register,"
Gibbons commutes during the week from his home in Grinnell
to work with mortgages at Wells Fargo in Des Moines Gibs
bans said that working with brokers and harried customers "is
a little different gig" than his job at the College,

“I'm wearing several hats up there too,” Gibbons said, “Can
I compare Ilicm? No, not really. I suppose that’s whyl kind of
like [the dining hall]."

A Grinnell resident for “the past 30, 35 years or so," Gibs
bons grew up in Pennsylvania, and while attending what is now
Bloomsburg University there, Gibbons said he decided to “take
time omrom college to just kinda do what I wanted to do."

From working at a ski resort in Colorado to living and vols
untcering in Norrh Carolina's Appalachia, Gibbons roamed the
country, making what he calls “enough money to get a little
apartment or what have you.” Gibbons estimates that be spent
over a year and a half volunteering and working at various
sites.

During a push westward, Gibbons found himself in
Grinnell. It was there thlit he
met several people in town
and through the College
who were “very interested in
opening up a bar."

After traveling to Calis
forniu, Gibbons, then 22
years old, began to drive back
to Pennsyllmniii. However.
his journey didn’t exactly go
according to plun.“The next plan was to get back to Pennsylva-
nin and reenioll and ﬁnish my education," Gibbons said. “ButI
made one last stop here in Grinneu and that was that."

Soon after landing in Grinnell, Gibbons opened up a bar,
Tracks, with several ofthe people he met during his first visit.
Soon, he met and married his \vit’c,horn and raised in Grinnell,
effectively securing himself forever as a Grinnell resident.

The doc ion to stay was not hard, as Grinnell persuaded
him in as ch: ic ways—interesting people and idyllic Iowan
life. “i grew to like Gtinnell and got to know the people at
the Collego,a.id1 got to like the college atmosphere,” Gibbons
sitid. “I liked the quietness, the people were very nice 1 was
hole and decided to stay"

”I liked the quietness, the

people were very m‘re... / was

here and derided l0 slay.”
