Can‘t Grinllell pay a comparable wage? It
not, why not?

How can a student be interested in his

No S’rrikes But. . .

At present student minimum wages at
Grinnell can hardly be considered an aid
toward deferring college expense. It is prac-
tically impossible to get along on less than
$1200 a year, But the maximum amount a
student can now earn is about $160. Does
this sound like an amount that is going to
help a student pay his way? At Oberlin 1|
student can earn $189 a semester or $378
a year. At Central he can earn his whole
board bill. At Iowa State Teachers it is
possible for students to earn about $210 a
year.

The student wages were last revised
in the spring of 1946. But since that time
living expenses have continued to rise. Here
are only a few of them: a four cent‘ increase
for laundered shirts, tell cent increase for
cleaning and pressing, five cents more for
a movie, etc. The only answer to these add-
itional costs is a higher student wage.

Dear Editor:

VWe should like to inform the
college of the conditions underi
which many of the Loose halll
women have been living for the‘
past month. In view of the fol-
lowing circumstances, we believe
that we are duly entitled to a
reasonable refund on money paid,
in many instances, for privatel
rooms in Loose hall. The factsi
are:

1. A definite fire hazard has
existed because of trunks,
cardboard boxes, and lock-
ers, which of necessity had
to be placed in the halls and
in rooms.

.Poor ventilation, basement
dampness. inadequate light-l
ing, and overcrowded bath-
rooms have impaired our,
health. In James basement,
for example, there is he run-
