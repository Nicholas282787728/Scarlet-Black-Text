WASHINGTON, D.C.~It is incredr
Ile, but the scandals surrounding
e Watergate investigation deepen

lection almost one year ago, many
ought that the break-in at the
emocratic National Headquarters
ould be a mere footnote in Ameri-
an political history, Now, after a
ear-long investigation of the Nixon
e-election effort and the Nixon
dministration, listing the men and
candals which have since been un-
overed would require an encylop-

If someone had published a novel
eptcting the events since last Mar-
h before the Watergate scandal,
e book and its author would have
ppeared ludicrous, Such 2i sequence
f events would have been utterly
yond the realm of even fictional
eliefl

The current tapes controversy is
case in point. A President forlivc
onths has steadfastly refused to
elease a set of tapes related to the
vestigation oi the scandal, even
t the cost oi firing the investigas
Dn’s special prosecutor and accs
pting the resignation oi the nttor»
ey general. Suddenly, he releases
em upon threat oi impeachment.
Just as the country recovers lrom
Ie shock of his sudden decision to
elease the tapes the American
eople are further stunned to learn
at key passages and even entire
, es are missing.

Two schools of thought, each sup-
rted if not led by two of this
ountry’s great newspapers, have

eveloped in recent days.

Two weeks ago, a New York Time:
Iitorlal called for Nixon to ”per—
.rm one last great service for the
ountry” and resign.

The Washington Post argued in an
-itorial several days later that it
ould be wrong for the president
. resign in the face oi great pubs
c pressure, instead, the Post urge

t Nixon to cooperate with the im-
achment proceedings so that his
crsonal integrity could either be
drilled or else subjected to trial
y the Senate.

I feel that impeachment is a far
tter course of action than resig—

iaims) it would be wrong ior him

ure. Presuming his innocence, his

Further, as Nixon has already
mphatically noted on several occs
sions, resignation is not a course

directed against him. Therefore,
Congress has no choice but begin—

Since the Saturday massacre, a
movement to impeach the President
has been building in Washington
and across the country. Like many
Americans, those working with the
Washington-based Committee to lms
peach the President were relieved
at the President’s decision to res
lease the tapes. However, the un»
usual circumstances surrounding
the missing (or, ii you preier,
"non-existent") and inaudible tapes
only strengthen the conviction of
the members of the Washington
Committee that impeachment pro»
ceedings must begin immediately.

illlEll‘o” coon Wild “‘5‘ dill)

Washington Committee members,
seriously evaluating their goals,
have iocuscd on two major alters
natives.

The ltl‘st was attempting to gens
exam a feeling towards impeachs
mcnt through action on a national

level. A mass march on the Cﬂp‘
ilnl had been considered.

The other alternative, which the
Washington Committee has decided
will he more profitable, is the
organization oi a grass roots im-
peachment movement.

A Committee member says he
ieels that 100 people protesting
at each Congressman’s local office
would be much more effective than
a single rally of 100,000 in Wash
ington,

Committee members began by calls
mg each Representative's office to
determine his stand on impeachment
and also to check the sentiments
expressed in his mail.

The check revealed that many Cons
gressmen have 1000 letters per
week on the impeachment issue,
with as few as 15 correspondents
opposing impeachment.

Many Republican congressmen sh-
owed nO hesitation in expressing
their support ior the creation of
a new special prosecutor, while
others openly admitted that thetime
had come to begin impeachment pro-
ceedings,

Committee members will use the
survey results to zero in on Conv
gressional districts in which the
Representative is either imposed
to impeachment or is undecided on
the issue,

Nader’s Raiders, which is also
working on impeachment, have al»
ready selected 70 such districts.
Citizens in these districts will be

encouraged to trim local Commi»
ttees to Impeach the president.
Members oi the Washington group
are now compiling a similar list.
The Washington Committee is also

urging local committees to insti-
tute teachsins arguing in favor of
impeachment. One suchteach»inhas
already been held at the University
of Maryland.

Committee members are beginn-
ing a major fund raising drive.
They are aiming their appeals at
major liberal contributors to past
Democratic campaigns, with funds
to be used in coordinating the na-
tionwide impeachment movement.

One Committee member summa-
rized the situation by noting, ”Im—
peachment is possible, but it will
require work.H He added thatmain-
tainil-ig continuing pressure on Con~
gressmen through letters is impor—
tant in keeping the impeachment
movement viable,

FBI Data

WASHINGTON, D.C.--First Dis—
trict Congressman Ed Mezvinsky
is one of eight members oi the
House Judiciary Committee whohas
studied a 1700 page FBI file on
Vice President designate Gerald
Ford.

Mezvinsky and the other seven
members will brief the rest of the
committee about the massive report,
which the Iowa Democrat described
as “the most exhaustive investiga-
tion ever conducted of a candidate
for public office.”

Mezvinsky says the Committee will
ignore the 10 day Thanksgivmg res
oess and proceed with hearings ins
to next week,

He adds that the committee work
will prevent him from returning to
the First District during the recess
as he had originally planned.

Dear Prez,

The increasingly shocking events
of the last month have brought to
the attention of this body the fact
that there was apparently a war
between your country and Israel
recently. Therefore, the Student Gos

following: I. That Eygpt should

nation should recognize the terri-

assure compliance.

If you or your nation should refuse
this ultimatum, we shall be forced
to immediately send letters to all
of your citizens, exposing certain
inconsistencies in your domestic
policy.

Tederman Proposes Counseling

Dean of Student Affairs Jim Ted-
erman has proposed a comprehen-
sive plan for consolidating Grin-
hell’s personal, academic, and psy-
chological counseling services,

Tederman's proposal, which was
iirst conceived almost two years
ago, has been referred to the Car
mmittee on Counseling. However,
he notes that no action will he ta—
ken until an evaluation of the res
sident adviser system can be calm
pleted.

Under the Tederman plan, the
offices of Student Affairs, Acade-
mic Advising, Career Servicesplus
a consulting psychologist would be
combined under one roof in an off-
campus college-owned house on
Park Street.

Resident advisers would work
in one or more of the four couns
scling areas above. They would be
committed to between it) and 20
hours per week in the consolidated

oiiice, with their primary respon-
sibility being to remain in the re»
sidence halls.

Rationale

Tederman feels that, ”students
seldom have just an academic pr-
oblem. There are usually personal
problems involved, and often cars
eer ones.“

Thus, he feels, students would be
better served by having all the
counseling offices working out oI
one office area, rather than have
ing them located in many separate
offices, as is the case now.

In addition, Tederman feels the
consolidation would provide closer
contact for those involved in couns
seling, allow resident advisers to
work together as a group, and pros
vide greater visibility ior the coun»
seling services

Fringe benefits listed ior the pro»
posed change include better utili-
zation of secretarial Staff, the op-

may end with the collapse of an
entire administration.

Bruce Buschel, Albert Robbins,
William Vitka, and Rod Nordland
are the authors of The Watergate
File. Buschel is a contributing ed-
itor of Today, the magazine of the
Philadelphia Inquirer, Robbins is
the former editor of the weekly
news magazine, The Drummer, and
Vltka is news director for radio
station WMMR.

Nordland, who served asthebook’s
editor, is a reporter ior the Phila—
delphia Inquirer.

Although certainly not a political
science text, or a book with a long
liie»expectancy, The Watergate File
should prove valuable to anyone
wishing to ioitow the Watergate
developments in detail.

Rhetoric

Unlimited

Although as a loyal Republican, l
cannot help but believe my Presi-
dent, Nixon’s announcement as to
the relative existence of certain
tapes was disbelieved by much of
the nation. As a public service, I
shall provide alternate excuses for
his next revision of this reality.
Dear Judge Sirica,

I would like to give you said tapes,
but...

1. My dog ate them.

2. David was screwing around with
a magnet, and mistakenly erased
them.

3. We used a Sony, and all the tapes
came out in Japanese.

4. To conserve energy, we cut
power to the tape machines onthose
days.

5. We ran out of tape one night so
i told my Secret Service man to
run to the drug store to get some
more, and he came back withmask»
ing tape.

6. Tricia used the tapes to record
an lanOncert show.

’1, Lightning struck the White House
the other night and fryed them.
it We had a ticker tape parade in
the East wing the other day, and got
sort or mixed up.

Consolidation

ehihg up of additional space in the
Forum and Burling Library (pre-
sent home of the Academic and
Student Aid Office and Office of
Career Services respectively) and
provide large cnnierence rooms ad»
jacent to the counseling oiiices for
large meetings oi staff and students.
Tederman emphasizes that the
proposal is “notaradicaland costly
restructuring at our present ser»
vices, but instead an attempt to co-
ordinate and improve them.”
