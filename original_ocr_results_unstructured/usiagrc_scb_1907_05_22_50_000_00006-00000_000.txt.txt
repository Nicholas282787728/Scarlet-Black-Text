FAREWELL POEM.

Following is the poem read at ”,0

farewell service held in the Old chapel

last week, it was composed by Di.

Steiner and and expresses the leeling

which is held [or the old room.

We leave no stately walls behind,

No mighty columns, lily-twined;

No echoing aisles detain our feet,

Our eyes no prismic glories meet.

No carven pews, no sacred shrine,

No altar lights in darkness shine,

N0 painted stories crowd the Wall,

X0 artist’s hand has touched thishall:

And yet our eyes see glory round,

And columns strong by lilies Wound,

And prismio lights from Hearenshine,

And Holy Presence all Dirine.‘

The noblest with our lives, to do.

The old and dead with life renew,

The worst of life that \i'eshould fear,

The best in life that we could hear,

liare made this chapel holy ground.

Our higllerself we here have found.

And here on God our souls did Wait,

Tim! made thlsspot iron) beauty great.

“'6 leave but barren Walls behind,

Just echoing space our voice shall rind:

But treasured still though buried here,

Are thoughts our lives shall hold most

dear.

Farewell! We speak the Word in pain,

Thou chapel old, thou chapel plain:

Thou chapel erer new and great!

For here our souls on God did wait.

In yonder new and beauleous place,

May we increase the love and grace

Which here in bygone days we found,

And make llml too, such lioly ground.
