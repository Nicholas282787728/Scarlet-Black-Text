years to take care of unexpect—
ed eiopenses, going last year to
the Cyclone.

No action was taken at uhe
faculty meeting on distribution
of the 15% of the sem fee de—
voted to student activities (5&3,
KGRW, Student Council, and
the student auditor). The fac-
ulty tabled the amendment
pending further study,

The amendment provided that
the student activity portion of
the fee be turned over to the
Central Committee of Student
Council for distribution. It pros
vides that a student-administra-
tion committee determine an-
nually the amount of this por-
tion, which was set this year
by such a committee at 15%.

The Central Committee last
night allocated this 15%. Fol»

tion, with amounts given to the
same groups last year:

$3415 $3712.50
Additional expenses expected
because of the proposed 5&3
supplement accounted for the
increase to 5&3. KGRW asked
for more money to extend its
services and to pay for equip-
ment purchased last summer.
The semester fee is a $15 fee
paid by every student each sem-
ester to provide a part of the-
funds for extrarcurricular activ-
ities. The fee this year, based.
on a first semester enrollment
of 850 and an estimated second
semester enrollment of 800,
would amount to $24,750.
