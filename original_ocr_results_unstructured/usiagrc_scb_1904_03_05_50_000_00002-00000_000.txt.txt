‘ college have
come to our cxchnnge tttble with-
in the last month and brought
iritlt them the ideatliata woman's
edition of SC\RLEI rim) BLACh
would not be an uninteresting
etitiosity. 1\CCOidil1;;'ly the young
women ot Iowa College hie llCl‘Cr
by challenged to edit an issue of
this paper at any |'Cgulzli‘ date or
publication before the spring va-
cation. It is the desire of the
regular management that the
special editors -sh;ill be
representative of some depart-
ment oi fcntini‘nc activity, such as
either literary society or both, the
v, \v, CA, or the college in gen»
eral, each class taking equal part
in the operations Possibly it
mightbe arranged to accommo-
date more than one organization.
at cl i if e r e n t times of Course,
and in that case the ﬁrst to come
will be ﬁrst to be served. This
suggestion is made with the hope
and expectation that it tilll be
taken seriously. Tile managers
will be found glad at any time to
discuss the matter with people
who mean business. Money, to
be sure, would be no inducement
'to such a venture but an effort at
'this kind could be made incidents
ally a source of proﬁt to some
good cause.

which the strident of this institu

wholesome stubborness and the
human reluctance to stiffer volunr
