LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

After living in the dorms for
three years, I feel 1 am qualified
to a certain degree to lodge this
protest concerning town asso-
ciatcs.

The dorm men look upon their
town associates as merely another
means of getting money, although
sometimes 1 doubt even that.

If the dorms really wanted the
town men as associates, they
would conduct an aggressive cams

m to get them into the fold.
Do they? No. may sit back in
their smug, self-satisfied manner-
and let the town men in many
cases he assigned to a hail,

Let us suppose that the town
man has associated with the
hall. One would think that the
dorm men would pay a little at
tention to him then, hut no. he is
still left to shift for himself
Whenever there is a house mectv
mg or a smoker, he goes unno-
ticed. In many cases he would
not even know when the house
party taltes placc if he did not
read it in the Scarlet and Black.
After the hall has his money, it
loses any interest that it might
have had in him in the tiist
place.

it is against this high handed
attitude that I register a vcher
ment protest, and the folloivingi is
a tentative plan which might set
them to thinking.

First, we shall consider Carney
and Macy men as being- town

men. nce, to all outward appear»;
ances. tiicsc men are treated \Vlthi

others, I

Give to the town men the en».
tire amount of their contribution
to the social fund and Conslrlel'l
them as a separate entity. They‘.
have their own officers and oral,
gaiiizations now. Why not carryi
the step a little further and give
them a position equal to the
dorms in intramural activitiesi
and social functions If there is
any question as to where to carry
on these functions, let Carney
and Macy be the places

I believe if such a plan were
carried out the dorm men would
soon lose their superiority com-
plex and a town organization,
working whole—heartedly as a
compact unit, would be to the
best interests of all concerned. I

alizc that the plan is somewhat
‘sketcily, and my denunciation of
the halls may be too strong and
also that evcryone is not of the
same opinion; therefore, 1 leave
the floor open to discussion and
invite comment and criticism.

Sincerely,
Roy Hyre,

Sargent ’ro Lis’r
Few This Year

Few debates wrll be scheduled
this year, according to George
Sargent, instructor in speech and
in charge of men’s debate.

“Because there seems to he a
feeling toward decision debates
and hecause they are costly," Sare
gent said, “it is impossible for us
to have as many as last year."

No debate manager has been
elected, but one will he soon, he
pointed out.

All men who have debated in
Grinnell are asked to meet Sare
gent Tuesday at 4:30 p. m.
