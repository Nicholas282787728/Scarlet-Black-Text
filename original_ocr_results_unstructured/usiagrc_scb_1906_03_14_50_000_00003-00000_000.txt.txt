BY A FORMER INSTRUCTOR.
EIOOIIIInglOII, Iiid., 321 North \ 'nsll-

ington Sireel, March a, 1906.—My
Dear Editor: I received your letter
this morning with its request, not tor
a recoiiiinendaiion. which you seemed
to lhinII I {cared but for a short arti-
cle for the Woman's Edition of the
“Seal‘let and Black.” I assure you, the
recommendation has far fewer terror-s
ior me than the newspaper al‘licIe,
the Ioriuer I can write {mm long hub~
it, with a good deal or facili -, simply
yaitiug names, dates and adjectives
to suit the applicant; whereas, the lat-
ter is ver formidable to one so little
accustomed to appearing in print as
myself. To overcome some of the em-
bar ssment I feel, I am going to
write you quite simply a letter, and it
you choose to use it tor your publicar
tioh, you are at liberty to do so; thus
I shall keep within rt realm in which
I feel at home.

Let me say at once that I appreciate
very much your wish to know some
thing about my life and work in its
new environment The “environment,"
I ﬁnd, constitutes the main new feat-
ure, for students and student prob-
lems are much the same in all ﬁrst-
class institutions, Nevertheless, there
are necessarily essential differences
between the smaller college, support
ed by private endowment, and the
larger state institutions. provided by
the state as the head and- climax of its
public school systent Each inslItu‘
tion has its advantages and disadvant
ages. Let me state right here my con»
viction, however, that luv the average
undergraduate student, especially for
Freshman and Sophomore years, I
consider the small college a much
better place. This was run conviction
when in GI'Innell, and n , experience
here has only reiniorced it. However-
this must he said: It my previous one
perience had been in some other small
institution. I might have concluded
ditterently, tor of course we all know
that Grinnell is very orceptional, and
not to he mentioned in the same
breath with most other colleges:

The smaller college, as a more uiir
ﬁed body. lends itself to the innnedi
ate inﬂuence of the personality of its
leaders. aird lhus generates a spirit oi
its own, while the university is a nun»
personal. soulless affair. For this re -
reason the univcrsity. . orfei-iiig
greater i'reedoin, is properly the place
for graduate and research worlt, where
it is the individual hont aiid genius
that wants to bc, pursucd. ‘

something of the latent possibilities
of "college spirit," when it is put to
the test.

Speaking more personally, I am
glad to say that the year has been

who are most hospitable,, and the
coming in contact with new phases of
academic liie.

Lire here is not nearly so strenuous
as in Grinneli—doubtless Blooming
ton being so much farther south, and
having many of the characteristics at
a Southern town, partly accounts for
this. But I aui sure we do not work
so hard as in Grinnell, and we take
more time to amuse ourselves.

heautiiul, are lined with immense elm
and maple trees which are glorious in
their autumn coloring ot greens and
reds and browns, The drives into the
surrounding country are numerous
and full of interest. It is said that
one can take a diderent route every
day in the year, and even then not
exhausL the possibilities. Does it not
sound inviting?

Mr. Heidel's study windows in Fisk
Hall can be seen the Connecticut Riv-
er, as it makes an abrupt turn to the
east, the town or Portland beyond, and
the deep blue hills in the distance.
The buildings on the campus are all
at brown stone, which is quarried
across the river. Two of them are
nearly a hundred years old, South Coi-
Iege and North College, though alasl
the latter, the most beautiful building
architecturally, anti the one most till-
ed with sentiment and college spirit
was burned to the ground only last

The buildings are covered with the
