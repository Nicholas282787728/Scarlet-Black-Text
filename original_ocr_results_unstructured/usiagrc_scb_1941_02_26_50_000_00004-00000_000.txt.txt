Pioneer’s Solo at Top of Conlerence Standings

Leave Friday

For Lawrence

Weekend Trip Will
Decide Loop Ouicome

For Grinnell Quiniei'

Afber winding up their sea-
son on the home court with
21. crucial victory over Coe and
an unexpected will from the
Drake five. the Pioneers
stand alone at the top 01' the
Midwest conference with nine
wins and only one 1055.

During the past few weeks, Coe
and Grinnell have been locked
together in the first place posi-
tioh, resulting in the Grinncll-Coe
game being classed as the decid-
ing game of the conference. The
Pioneers gained the lead at the
right time last Saturday night and
jolted the Kohawks out of the
deadlock with 37-32 defeat.
Possibilities Listed.

Now that Coe has two losses
chalked up against them as com-
pared to one for Grinnell. several
possibilities arise regarding- the
final outcome of the loop Stands
ings. If the Kohawks can over-
come the invading Carleton five

Friday night. the Pioneers must
Wm two remaining conference
games with Lawrence and Ripon
to have an undisputed title claim.
Should Griniiell win one and lose
one over the weekend, they would
shaie the championship With Coe.
Losing both games would give Coc
the crown

The other teams in the circuit
are out of the final decision
Ripon blasted Carleton last week,
41 to 31. to more into the third
position, but will have to defend
itself against Eeloit and Grinnell
before the season is over. Mon-
mouth defeated Cornell last night,
thus taking over the fourth place
spot. Next week‘s games include
Lawrence at Beloit Thursday
night. Monmouth at Knox Friday
night. and Carleton at Cornell
Saturday night.

Lawrence Battle Saturday.

The Pioneers should have little
trouble disposing of the Lawrence
quintet Saturday night. Although
they started the season in whirl-
wind fashion, the Wisconsin team
has been beaten by the best and
the worst in the Coiiferencei
leaving them a slim chance of
heating the Pioneers, who only
have to overcome the disadvan-
tage of playing on a foreign court.

Monday night's game with

the Pioneers, They will he play

much a thriller as some of the

,Freshman Fears
Future For
Famous Fedora

The now-famous Stetson which
was presented to Ben Douglas
by G. Lester Duke at the pep
rally Monday is likely to look
like a strip of old shoe-shine felt
by next October, according to
Harold Jekei, Clark pep.

Jckel, who came to
from Maplewood. Mo.. where
Douglas coached at the high
school, also pointed out that this
hat was definitely not the first
dist the Grinnell coach has own-
cd. In fact he bought several
each football season. if Jekel is
to be believed.

“Douglas ruined three or four
hats each fall." the Clark prep
said. “He twisted them out of
shape during the game, and part
of the time he was walking on
his favorite fedora. It would take
a gross of bats to see Douglas
through a regular Pioneer foot-
ball season in my opinion."

scheduled irith Drake for that
season and lost the first one at
home by a 31 to 13 score. The
second meeting of the Pioneers
and Bullodgs was in the Drake
tieldhonsc and proved to be one
that the spectators will never for
get.

Drake was ahead at the end
or the first half. 24—17, and ear-
ried that lead during the greater
part of the second period. Then,
with the chips down and a big
