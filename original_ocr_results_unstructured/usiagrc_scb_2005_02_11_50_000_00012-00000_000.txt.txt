Pro-Life Group denounces STOPP

First, I would like to speak briefly on
behalfof the Pro-Life Group: We were not
involved in any way with STOPP or Miss
sionaries to the Pre-Born.
We did not invite them.
we do not use their men
tics, and we have no con-
nection with them.

Further, I am fairly
sure that they had no
idea oui group existed, so
their coming has nothing
to do with us,

Speaking for myself
now,l ainjust as appalled as the rest of the
Cnmplls. I hope that the PmsLife Group
was able to show last semester what it’s
goals are: breaking stereotypes of people
who are preelire by bringing in liberal and
reminist speakers; increasing dialogue on
campus about a sensitive
and important topic; and
in general being a peace
ful, respectful presence on
campus.

The people associated
with STOPP have under
mined all these efforts
with their tactics, and
have brought an intolerr
ant, narruwrmindedﬁnd
even frightening presence to campus that,
in my opinion, mars both the pro-life
movement and Christianity.

peared in last week's seeB, asking her to

leave. Her response, and my original letter,
are posted on my Plan, [goddesca].

One of the most disturbing lines trom
the response I received is.
“We believe that both the
abortionist and the abort—
ing woman deserve to be
executed. Their only hope
(and ours) is to confess
their sins, and turn from
them

Only then can the
blood of Jesus Christ
cleanse them flom their
guiltThey cannot live in rebellion to God
and not be his enemy."l hope it goes with
out saying that 1 want nothing to do with
this viewpoint.

My sympathies are sincerely with the
students who were singled out by Ms. Hols
man’s letter. I am disgust
ed, Grinnell, but please
do not associate in: or my
group with such people as
the Holmans.

They cannot be real-
soned with, and they very
clearly do not represent
an ethic oflife.

The real
scandal

To the Editor,

Reading between the lines of Ms.
Holman’s letter, I was pleased to learn
that Grinnell students can get rides to the
Planned Parenthood in lowa City.

Contrary to MsHolman’s assertion that
she knows the person she saw in the Grins
nell vehicle was obtaining a (safe and legal)
abortion, there are many reasons why a per-
son might seek care at Planned Parenthood,
They provide medical exams, STD rests,
birth control, and emergency contraception
among other services. Perhaps this student
wanted more anonymity in her health care
than a small town like Grinncll can provide.
The readers of the S€§B might want to
know that Ms. Holman has been arrested
in from of Planned Parenthood for disor-
derly conduct, Ms. Holman’s husband once
expressed his approval of the murder of a
doctor who performed abortions, and the
Emma Goldman Clinic had a restraining
order against him. Pronife, indeed. Stay
safe, Grinnell women, and stay healthy.

Putting the
Democrat back in
Campus Democrats

In an open letter to the community last
week, the Campus Democrats asked what
direction the group should rake this year,
but perhaps
we should step
back and ask
who Granrscd
(or should I say,
Bel‘lTCfnCchP)
these leaders au-
thority to write
letters and make
decisions on her
halfofthe group
in the first place.

15 it not irons
ic that the only
student group with the word “democrat”
in its title chooses its leaders by an undiSs
closed and undemocratic process?

I support the group’s political goals, and
harbor no personal grudges towards Baker,
Garden-Monheit, Martyn or Weyl, Hone
ever, 1 also believe unelecred leaders sap the
group’s legitimacy and undermine its efﬁ—
cacy.

A suitable remedy might include four
resignations, an apology and an election.

Keep that indoors

Pissing is a perfectly natural function ofa healthy
body. So is makes perfect sense that we supply an
abundance of facilities speciﬁcally for this purpose.
Which begs the question to some male student:
Why did you mistake the tree outside of James {or
one of these facilities? Drunk? Probably not it was a
weeknight. Confused? Perhaps, but surely the glow
orlarnes only slightly to your left should have tipped
you of that there may have been better places ﬂit this.
This seems to be yet another example or men abuse
ing their luck in the getting the physiological ability
to pee standing up, You would never 5:: a woman
squatting outside a dorm, yet men at Griniic-ll seem
to pee on things as if it was their Godsgivcn right
and male duty. But surely sonic peoplevpaniculai'ly
this guy—should feel some qualms about exposing
his package. I mean why open yourself up to that
kind ofcriticism? Is it worth saying anyway: Grinncll
men, don’t abuse your penises.

Don’t tap my reserves

1 know that even though I rarely go to the par-
ties for which people solicit moncy,I should be a nice
person and help out my fellow students or whatever.
But I don’t want to. That change is for when I have
no money and need coffee. It's for when I want to
go to Taco Bell but want to pretend I’m not actually
spending money. it’s my reserves, the reassurance that
even if my bank account is empty, my pockets are not.
And I never ask who is at my door, so before I know
it, I’ve said “come irraiid there are people there with a
cup and they always risk so nicely ifI have any change,
and they know you're lying if you say you don't have
any money, because everyone has spare change, so
call me a penny-pinching bitch, but leave me and iily
coins alone.

Cowlestastic?

You know. sometimes you're hungry, very hun-
gry. You are dreaming up the perfect thing to quell
that hun r. As you walk to Cowles, you smell that
thing an it makes you happy. The menu even says
that your favorite is for dinner. So, then you wait in
line fol a halran hour and you walk through the door,
where you can ﬁnally see what the food is. What you
were hoping for is nowhere to be seen, in its place
is BLT pizza with warm mayonnaise and talal'els. its
not that these things are bad, rhcjust simply don't cut
it. So then,you resort to the sidebar, which looks up-
pealing, even snidls good, but after about three bites
you realize it is nothing more than frontieresqe boot.
1 mean really, how do you screw up cheese pizza?
