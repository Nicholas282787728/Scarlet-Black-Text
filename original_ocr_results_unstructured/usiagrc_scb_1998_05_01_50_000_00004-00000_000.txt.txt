Sandman also creates much other
material in his two side bands, the
Hypnosonlcs and the The Pale Broth-
ers. The former is a Gapicce dance/
funk band, while the latter presents
a sharp contrast as an acoustic guitar
duo.

Besides his proliﬁc music career,
Sandman is notorious for being one
ofthe most difficult rock stars to in-

In regards to ticketdistribution. a
stir has arisen regarding that mattler,
as well. Tickets became available
at the Forum desk at noon on Tues-
day, but a great deal of students were
uniformed about this. Apparently.
the SGA Minutes were supposed to
print a notice about the tickets, but
due to a slip of some sort, the mes-
sage was neglected. Consequently,
the limited tickets (roughly 400 in
number) landed in the palms of ran-
dom students who were lucky
enough to have heard the gossip.

been made to inform students about

Since 1959, Second City Comedy
Troupe has been a stepping stone for
many famous actors and comedians,
including Bill Murray, Gilda Radlter,

Ironic theme is being
overdone nowdays,
Morphine‘s sound is
certainly one of the
most unique among
bands popular with
college students and
hip twenty some-
things.

Hailing from Boston, the
threesome’s obvious trademark is
their catchy-yetvdreary acid-jazz
sound, fre-
quented by
other ex-
perimental
instruments
Sandman's
trademark
device is his
two-string
bass, a slide
instrument
thatactsin a
f a s h i o n
similar to a
guitar.

Maphire‘s
sound has
often been
described as
“beat-noir,”
as well.
which is a
new breed of sound characterized by
addictive seductiveness. Sandman’s
husky, thick voice distinguishes him
from practically any other vocalist in
his field, While the band’s tireless
touring has brought them internar

m tional fame.

Deemed “1994 5 biggest under-
ground pop success" by Rolling
Stone and winners of the 1992 Bos-

ton Music
Award for Best
Independent Al—
bum of the Year
(Good), the band
has settled quite
nicely among
other tour-heavy
bands.

With ﬁve ale
bums,Morphine
has released
products off of
three different
labels: Accurate
R e c o r d s ,
Rykodisc, and,
most recently,
Dreamworks.
H o w e v e r ,
Morphine‘s lat-
est album Like

Swimming was released by both of
the latter two labels.

Like Swimming features the tritar,
a rare instrument that is part bass,
pan guitar, and played with a slide.
The album opens with an organ and
also includes acoustic guitar rather

tare to Morphine’s other releases.
Morphine will visit Grinnell be—
tween their‘LOmaha and Cincinnati
datesAftet' this tour, Morphine plans
to immediately head bask to the stu-
the to work on
their new al-
burn.

Well, everybody, this is If, The big ﬁnish to the 5&3, and conse-
quently the end of my movie reviewing career at Gtinnell. It only lasfed
a semester. yes, but it was the sweetest, lovliest time of my life. And
not just because I told you what was what in terms of the big Harris
screen, but because I felt we really shared something. And I’m cel-
ebrating by reviewing all of these movies without seeing them. What
do you think of that? And the reviews will, of course, be packed with
lies, but you should be used to that by now.

All About Eve
Starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter

Did you secrelely like Showgirls? How would you like o version
from 1950 with no grotuilious breast shots, as well as strangely
wholesome actors? And it would take place in Broadway instead
of Los Vegas. Add six Oscors to the mix, including one for Best Picv
lure, and you have All Aboul Eve.

As Good As it Gets: Reviewed by Secret Juan bbb l/2

Directed by James L, Brooks. Starting Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt,
the! guy from Later, and other Hollywood tools

Ifind myself In the only semi-unique position oftrying to review a
movie that I only vaguely remember Somehow this holf—heorted
attempt is better than whatever my good friend and colleague, Bryon
Dunhom, could have mustered on the subiect. Slacker.

As Good As It Gets, us I recall, was o pretty solid movie with

'issues thrown in as an added bonus for you, the appreciative
film-goer. By issues, I mean boIh thematic conlent us well osJock
Nicholson's obsessive-compulsive chorocler, As a person, iust like
you, who is intrigued by ”obnormol” and socially devionl behavior,
Ilound his portrayal of the film's protagonist/antagonistic be per-
versely entertaining The men is funny, yet more bigoted than my
nozi neighbors back home; he is cold and grinchrlike, yet, get this,
is actually a coring, compossionole person. Strangely enough, i
can‘t seem to recall the chorocler’s name. Just call him Mr. Am-
biguous.

 

In addition to Jock Nicholson’s sublime performance, the rest of
the movie was pretty decent too. There were other characters
played by actors and actresses who turned in credible perfor»
monces As I recoll, the plot concerned the interpersonal relation,
ships between Jack’s 0CD,
Greg Kinneor’s goy ortisi,
ondnHelen Hunt’s
frazzled single motherwho
is looking for o MAN and
some booty, but not nec~
essorily in that order. Each
is o touching portrait of
humanity in all of Its while—
ness. This movie, how-
ever, isolsoo comedy,

City is a seminal comedy group dedi-
cated to making people laugh. Like
Grinnell's student improv crew, the
. Ritalin Test Squad, the Second City
group performs a variety of classic
scenes and archival material (mate-
rial from pervious shows). However,
the troupe is probably best known for
. its improvisational skills, which in-
volve members taking suggestions of
situations from the audience and
turning them into comic material {or
their performance.

“Can’t make it to see us, then we
will come to you" is the Chicago—
' based Second City's motto. Second
City has traveled around the nation
and world to all sorts of colleges.
performing arts centers, clubs and
theaters, Tile troupe usually stays
within the Midwest, but has made
trips to Colorado, Utah, and New
‘ Mexico, They also make two annual
trips to the East Coast and one other
annual trip to Vienna, Austria, which
, is, according to troupe memberAlly
' Davis “very different from anAmeri-
can audience.” Davis has been do-
ing improv for eight years. She has
been with Second City for the past
‘ two years, making her the longestv
standing member on the team. Ac-
cording to Davis, no one stays with
Second City for an extremely long
period of time.

she's So Lovely
Directed by Nick Cossovefes. Starting Sean Penn, Robin Wright

Penn, John Travolta

So, the Cossovetes family is legendary for their moviemuking
skills, or so I’ve heard. Whot young Nick presents us with here is
story of love gone awry. Robin Wright Penn’s character marries Sean
Penn’s character (genius costing there, let me tell you). But Sean‘s
character gets busted oil to ioil for some sort of crime or some-
thing. She remorries, but he gets out thanks to 0 little friend colle eg
the nail file. He comes back and trouble erupts. Which one shoul
she choose? Vado yodo. Thor’s why I ask all my prospective girl-
friends (that's right, they line up at the door) if they have ever bee
married to a criminal who is likely to be paroled soon and kick m
USS.

Career Girls
Directed by Mike Leigh. Starring Kolrin Cortlidge ond lynda
Sleodmdn

 

6 years oﬂer porting ways, two women reunite and find things
have changed. One is o rodeo clown, the other a high-priced pros-
titule. So they sit around and discuss this, and chat oboulfhot, on
drink some coffee. They' find out that even though they hdv
changed so much that they are not the friends they were bocki
high school, or wherever, they’re really not so different. Or som
other emotional something or other.

Spice World
Directed by I don’t care, Starring Posh, Baby, Sporty, Scary, Gin-
ger, ond Wolfie Spices

this thing off of the pass. I know that everyone I know is gotng t
see this movie, but seriously, everyone needs to get over thts the
little phenomenon. It was cool to have u cute little Ironic obsession
with the Spice Girls for about a week. But it's old now. I don‘t won
to hear any more oboul it. Let it die. You’re not being originol, You're
being sod, and making an ass out of yourself. So, long story short,
I am planning on burning the Harris Center down (unless the crock
Harris securityleom can stop me) during the showing oflhis movie,
and if you go and see it, you will be killed. See everybody next
semester,

OK this isnt playing for over a week but I iust wanted to hen;
