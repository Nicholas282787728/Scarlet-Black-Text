Jazz ill the 1960's launched itself
in Several directions. John Coltrane,
Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor
all initiated trends and established
lollowings, in a very real sense the
musical shape of the decade was
determined by these men. Yet, if by
nothing else, they are linked by the
fact that each has pushed his illr
strilment to the furthest extent imr
azinable, and has taken the music
as far as would Seem possible. Iiind
it hard to conceive or anything muCn
further out thn Coleman‘s Free
Jazz or Coletrane’s Ascension, Ar'
chie Sllepp and Coltrane blew a
screaming avantegarde duet at
Newport a iew years ago, lust two
tenors improvising, ieeding oli‘each
other’s energy. A beautitul thing,
to be sure, but how much further
can musicians extend themselves in
this direction? In their latest
albums, Coleman and Taylor would
seem to be exploring and iitling out'
their music, having already defined
its scope earlier in their careers.

Miles Davis presented one answer
to the problems of this “tree”
Jazz with his albums In A Silent
Way and Bitches Brew, Miles has
always iollowed his own path, and
his idea was to experiment with the
sounds and instruments themselves,
while Coltrane, Coleman, et, al.
concerned themselves with the muse

Fuller lecture to Cap Career Week

by Bonnie Roswig

'The culmination of Career Enrichr
merit Week will Come on Saturday
evening when Eredan O’Regan will
speak on “Broad Concepts of Bucks
minster Fuller plus World Game.”

Co-ordinating the program is As-
sistant Dean of Students, Ms, Mar-
jory Daley. Ms Daley explained
that Mr O’Regan is a young scien-
tist Iron-l the Design Science
institute in Washington, DC, -His
mayor iield is math and thedevelopr
ment oi a special math language and
also brain research, said Ms, Daley.
The theme of Mr. O'Regan‘s speech
Will be the “closed systems”theory
or Buckminster Fuller plus World
Game, she explained.

The impetus tor the program came
from Grinnell Alumnus PhilBrown,
who is president of the Inter-State
insurance Company in Des Mpines.
Ms. Daley explained that she and
Mr. Brown telt, “that the student
population is very cosmopolitan and
urban in their approach to the world
and that the students needed, pros
grams dealing with world concepts-
the World in a sense of totality.”

According to Ms, Daley a student
committee was set up during the
spring to discuss the program and
iinal arrangements ior Mr.
O’Regan‘s speaking engagement
were made over the summerby Mr.
Brown and her Ms, Daley added
that two more speakers will be ens
gaged to speak on the theme.

sounds, Miles turned to electronic
sources, and these albums employ
electric pianos, basses, and guiv
tars, as well as effects like horn
echo and ring modulator. One hears
a solo voice soaring above a churnr

phrase.

it is unnecessary to try to de-
termine the exact extent of Miles
inﬂuence ’on Herbie Hancock; five
years at playing piano with the
Davis quintet must have had its eir
lect Yet Herbie has remained very
much his own man, as witnessed

by his string oi albums released
both during and alter his stay with

Miles. His work has gone through
several phases, starting with the
now near-classic “Watermelon
Man” on his first album, Takin‘
oft. “Maiden Voyage" is another
well known Hancock tune; the album
of the same name and Empyrean
isles represent a beautiiul phase
in his development. The chief char-
acteristics ot the Hancock piano
style--experimental chord exten-
sions and a clean, relatively sparse
solo linenare nicely shown onthese
albums. Hancock may behest known
to people througnllls more commer-
cial ventures, Fat Albert Rotunda
and his music for the television
Series, The Prisoner. Thesealbums
show Hancock’s willingness to bore
row from popular terms to enhance

his own ideas.

Still, I don’t know it I was ready
for the man’s latest venture, Mwan-
dishi and Crossings. These al-
bums represent a new direction
in his music, a direction partially
determined by his extensive use of
electric instruments and devices,
and by his iorming a regular seXr
tet or top notch musicians, includ-
ing Buster Williams on bass, Billy
Hart, drums, Eddie Henderson,
trumpet, Benny Maupin, bass clare
inet, ilute and soprano sax, and
Julian Priester on Trombone. There
is an incredible amount of emph-
athy shared in their playing, and
both Maupin and Priester, as well as
Hancock, contribute material, The
Sextet operates as a unit, rather
than as a leader and Sidemen,whlch
makes for an interesting musical
approach.

Crossings is the more advanced
of the two albums, as Well as be-
ing the most demanding. The title

cut, “Sleeping Giant,” occupies the
entire first side and exists as a

single musical entity. Starting with
a burst of Alrican percussion, the
Composition moves into an extended
electric piano solo, showing that
Hancock is second to none in mas-
tering this very delicate instrument.
The piece continues in a similar
manner, with solos interspersing

varied rhythmic patterns. The use
of synthesizer and eChoplex are pare
ticularty ellectve in heighteningclir
maxes and making transitions, A
recurring Milesrllke theme gives
continuity to the composition, and the
soloists, particularly Maupin, are
very etiectlve in playing according
to established moods. AClimatlc
electric ending concludes the piece,
an ending that modulates into the
sound of waves and seagulls, pro-
viding one oi the best uses or sound
eiieets in music i have ever heard.

Crossings should be picked up on
by everyone, both tor its own sake,
and because it is line music tor heavy
spacing out The album takes you
through a spectrum oi moods and
ieelings, and provides a beautiiul
way to get into recent Miles Davis,
and, via Miles, into other aspects
oi contemporary jazz. Even it you
stop with Crossings alone, the al»
bum remains a rewarding trip in
itseli.
