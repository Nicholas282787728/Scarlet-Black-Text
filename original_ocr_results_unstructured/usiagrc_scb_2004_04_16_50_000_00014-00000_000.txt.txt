Running rot president is a tough job. Not only have i spent the
last three months campaigning 18 hours a day, but I’ve had to work
endlessly developing new and innovative policies to help re.shape
America. One of the perks of the rob, however, is that you have a
countless number ofinteresting conversations along the way. Here's
a rough transcript ofa recent conversatiort l had with conservative
writer and strategist David Horowitz on campus the other day.

this conversation.> I love what you conservatives have done widi nick.

2004).

Rathod: Right, so I'll infer from your reasoning that you want to
see more Republican ludases with professorships.

Horowitz: “As 1 said, ludas lscariot, Tokyo Rose, Benedict Arnold

ll had the tight or fret speech" (Hannity and Colmes, lleozeol),

Rathod: You know, D-Ho, there could be other reasoits besides
an elaborate socialist takeover plot to explain the large number of
liberal edumtors. In fast, your fiulty analysis is a elassic example or

ing at Bob Jones university, it won’t help yoirr cause at accredited
colleges like Grinnell.

Horowitz: “Black males are six pcrcent of the population. they
eomrnit 50 percent or the violent crimes in dtis country, one in
three young blask males is a convicted criminal" (Chuck Baldwin
Live, 06.06.97).

Rdrliod: Alright, it’s oit now. You‘ve significantly manipt ted
statistics to serve your own iaeist ends. But, even ifthere is art indi-
nation orttuth in your statistres, it only proves that our notice Syy
tent is racially biased. A number orstudies have demonstrated that
black males are disproportionately targeted by police, and conse-
quently, are stopped, searched, arrested and incarcerated at dispro-
portionate levels. As black males are baselessly targeted and impris-
oned at disparate levels, black eitrldren often have to grow tip in frag
merited communities and single—parent households. Its all a selfful.
filling prophecy created by bad polite policy and exploited by racist
commentators.

Horowitz: “To focus the social passions orAfricaneAnterieans on
what some Ametiotns may have done to their artcestors ﬁfty or a
hundred and frftyyears ago is to burden them with a crippling seirse
ofvictim.hood" (“Teri Retuons why Repanttiorrs is Bad for blacks

Ralhod: Why are you trying to evoke anger and fear by bringing
up irrelevant issues? 1 wasn't talking about the atrocities some Amerir
earis committed over a eenrury ago, but rather the racist policies that
policymakers endorse today. As for the victimization argument, do
you recall what you recently told a etowd in Madison, Wis.>

Horowitz: “I am the target ora nationwrde hate campaign dc»
signed to do only one thing. And that is to silence me."

Potthod. Yeah, Del-lo. that’s the quote. Doesn’t that sound a little
like victimization?

Homwitz: “No, no. 1 was a victim” (Hanniry and Colmes, oze
05-2002).

Rathod: Life must be so tough as a rich, white, heterosexual male.
I mean having to represent a group orpeople that controls 96 per.
cent quEO positions must be quite burdensome. You really are a
vretint.

[After a short pause, Horowite’s demeanor became quite solemn
and his tone changed rronr confrontational to conciliatory]

Horowitz: "Okay. This is sheer hypocrisy and smokesereen”
(Hanniry and colines, 9.15.2003.)

After my eonversatiorr with D-Ho, he was a changed man. The
following afternoon, he led a march roi- hate crimes legislation and
even helped cook at SlAG's eontinunity nteal. To sttpport D-Ho‘s
new transformation (and ensure that he doesn't beeoirte insecure and
make another shift to the radical right) i suggest that everyone eome
hear him speak on Monday nrgltt and wearas much liberal pamphere
min to the event as possible, lhcket signs of“F|ee Muniia” and “Save
Afntrnative Action" will certainly help the cause. And I'm sure occa»
sional chants of“Down with Bush" and “No More War" wrll ease his
mind as well.

are aeeutate (in the sense that he has stated them either in interviews
or in his own work), an aetual conversation with him did not trane
