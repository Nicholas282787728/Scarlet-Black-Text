Locill Team in Tillie Negative Side (if
Supreme Court Question.

The question of the Grinnelei-eigh.
ton debate tomorrow night in A. R. H.
auditorium will be: "Resolved. that
Congress should be empowered to
override by a twothirds vote, decisA
ions of the Supreme court which de-
clare acts of Congress unconstitution—
al." The question is exceptionally
timely because of the great contro.
versy which has arisen of late over
the Supreme court's decision in the
Child Labor Law case, and because
Robert La Folletto made it one of the
chief planks in his platform during
the presidential campaign.

The Creighton team composed of
Messrs, F. c. Charvat, J. F. Gannon,
and F. F. Fugarty will uphold the af-
firmative side of the question. while
Messrs. Loren Reid, '27. Russell, Smith,
'25, and Robert Burilngcme, '28, will
represent Grihneli on the negative
side. Thc debate will he the second
appearance of each of tho Grinneli
debaters on the Varsity platform and
Burliugame's first appearance before
it local audience. Little is known of
the Creighton representatives except
that Charvat, their captain. is a man
of three years' experience.

The debate will be judged by ML J.
F. Carroll, the debate coach at Drake
university. Mr. Carroll is a graduate
of Amos and has taken considerable
graduate work at Harvard.

On Feb. 27, the same local negative
team will debate Knox college here
on the same question.

EXPERIMENT WORTH WHILE

'l'n)lor Gives Excellent Pomyﬂl of
Diffluult Emotions of Old Age
in “The GollL”

(By E. H. Eilharz)

if the critics who have hailed Mich-
i ael Arlen as “the second Wilde" could
have witnessed ”The Ace of Thirteens"
they would have seen their ball turn
to ice. Dramatically, the Arlen play
was a “freezeout,” Frankly, we
thought there was nothing to Arlen;
‘the lilies which sparkled in a boolt
were about as radiant as dough on
the stage, Nor is this the fault of
Miss Rust or the production itself. The
blame rests entirely with Michael Ar-
leu. Having seen the experiment of
Saturday we venture to say that “The
Green Hat" will last about three
weeks on Broadway.

Miss Rllst's adaptation is excellent;
she has preserved what little of dra-
matic value there is in Arlen and in
addition brought to the original a

finely balanced construction, con-
trast, and understanding. But with
all of its accoutremcnts “The Ace of
Thirtecns” wasn't a play; it was so
plastered with eplgrarns and nuns that
wit became borcsome. -Arlcn lacks
discrimination. Like some others he
does not know when to stop.

'An ,‘Amlllilons Production

In presenting "The Ace of Thir.
teens" the Experimental Theatre lust.
ified its name. This was by far the
most interesting and ambitious pro-
duction that the group has yet offer-
ed us. To present such an offering
took courage and brains, and both
were evident in the performance. The
stage picture was splendid, the setting
suggestive. The actors were supplied
with little in the way of lines but
they achieved much. Given two lines
and a name Mr. Arey created an Eng<
lishman that was English. Miss
Boutou sensed the essential character
of Lady Amelia. Katherine Gilmore
was as haughty and arrogant as Lady
Surplice should have been. Having
the most to do Mr, McGee acquitted
himself well and was instrumental in
making “The Ace of Thirteens" a com-
edy. All of the actors spoke with
too much precision; although we are
of the provinces it is better to ac.
celcrate speech until it becomes like
that of normal human beings even il a
few ychcls miss the point,

‘Tlm Goal Successful

“The Goal" by Henry Arthur Jones
preceded “The Ace of Thirtens.” it
is one of the best of the one act plays,
On Saturday night’s bill it was inter.
cstipg chicily because it had dlr. Tay-
lor in the role of Sir Stephen. Al.
though iir. Taylor's performance was
uneven, he gave, on the whole,
skillful and intelligent impersonation
of the aged engineer. Insofar as a
youth can iiuitatc eighty summers,
Taylor succeeded in portraying dif-
ficult eruptions with splendid effect,

experimenting, and that is what we

not be disappointed. it provided
Grinueil with excellent theatrical

asm well seasoned with surprise and

ous licks in ﬁnal preparation these
last few days.

last Wednesday evening, the club
sang before the Fellowship contereuce
delegates at the reception in the Quad-
rangle dining room, and Friday mor .
ing at long chapel. Dr. Fosdic‘k was
so impressed Wednesday evening that
it was M his rednest that club repeated
Friday morning. Sunday evening
the Club sang at tho Congre-
tionai, Methodist, and Baptist churches

Tomorrow morning the regular

be especktlly strong this year.

"Come Again Sweet Love" is the
prize song which every club will sing,
and which will be graded fifty per
cent on the scoring basis. “Reveille"
by Elgar has been selected by Prof.
David E. Pack, the director, as Grin.
nell's choice song. The song is very
difficult, probably more so, than any
other school will attempt to sing.
This selection has been saved tor some
time by Professor Peck, but he feels
that this year tbe club can handle it
successfully. it will be graded on a
30% basis. The “Alumni Song" will
conclude Grinnell's program. frhis is
the song that ”look” so well last
year. it accounts for the remaining
20% of the scoring system.

The contest will take place Monday
