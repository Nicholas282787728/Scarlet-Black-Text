UNLIMITED CUTS.

In accordance with the policy announced by the
SCARLET AND BLACK last spring we are again
urging the Institution of an unlimited cut System for
certain students. As a basis for this selection we
should suggest the grade list published each summer
by the college.

Students Whose names'appear on this list are for
the 'most part ihcse of superior initiative and concen-
trative powers. Their only recognition for their
higher scholastic standard is this pamphlet which is
scanned, perhaps commented upon, and promptly for.
gotten.

If there existed in Grinnell some tangible definite
appreciation of endeavor it seems most reasonable to
suppose that there would be a greater effort on the
part of students to make scholastic records. at the
present time we believe this appreciation to be sadly
lacking.

in their

classes are capable of exercising both proper and con—
servative 'judgment about the number of cuts they
should take. The knowledge that they were selecting
for themselves both the number and the classes they
should cut would give that sense which college stu—
dents greatly ncedi sense of depending upon and
trusting tllcir own initiative and judgment.

THE FILESHMAN-SOI’HOMDRE SCRAP. ,

Thus for very little has been said in regard to the
Fl‘eshmanrsopllomore scrap although at this time last
year tiic affair was a matter of history. The obsence
of any loud or- insistent dcinands.that the scrap be
bold is probably due to a rcticcncc on the part of the
potential belligerents to press the matter.

This rcticcncc is excusable if the scrap this year
is to be held in the same way that scraps in former
years have been held. In the ﬁrst place they have
usually bccn set for some day in the week which
meant that all chance for class preparation from nine
o'clock on until tlircc in the morning on the part of
any of the participants was impossible. In addition
to handicapping both freshmen and sophomores for
the following day's classes by cutting down on their
preparation it cut down very considerably on a
normal nights sleep 5

It would seem that with but little adjustment a
satisfactory arrangement might be made by which
these difficulties might be lessened or completely
eliminated. Either the preliminary skirmishing from
nine to three o'clock which rarely resulted in anything
but false alarms, a lot of ill-directed maneuvers, and
attacks on everyone but the members of the opposing
class, could be ruled out, or if authorities cared to con»
tinue this feature of the ﬁght, the affair could be set
for Saturday evening thus allowing a full Sunday
morning for the belligerents to recuperate.

It would be regretable if a few avoidable dif-
ficulties were to cause the freshmanrsophomore scrap
which has been one of the most colorful and harmless
features of Grinnell to go the way of all traditions.
