administration's “Enron economa
ics" and expressed a Wish to “send
Tom DeLay back ro Housron."

Dean reiterated the enticwer
stance that initially vaulted him to
national popularity and criticized
die Bush Administration's foreign
policy. “[I would] send American
rroops anywhere rn die world ro
defend Amenm." he said, “[but]
