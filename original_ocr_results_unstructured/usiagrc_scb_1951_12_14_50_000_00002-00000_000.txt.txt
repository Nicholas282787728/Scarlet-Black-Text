Dear Sirs,

Several times during the year
i: have heard various people
dicing, “How can we make
KGRW a better radio station?"
May 1 say that as far as 1 can
see, any change would be an im-
,‘lrovement.

When I came to this School as
l freshman in 1949 I joined the
.‘l‘xitf of KGRW and felt honored
£0 be a member of what X con-
.ldered an up and coming pro-
lactl Last year I think the sta-
tion hit a slight downhill slide,
hut showed signs of picking up
with new equipment, a larger
'aﬂ, more new records and
tome good live shows.

This year I think that all has
gone down the drain in an of-
i'Dl‘t to make KGRW the biggest
oliganization on campus. What
hey think this will accomplish
1'. don’t know, but I think many
Old. members of the station and
many listeners will agree that
are bad a better campus radio
a years ago with about 30 peo-
gle than they now have with
over 130 members. It seems
mat the old adage of “toomany
Cooks" holds vel'y true here.

It also might seem that
BIGRW concentrated a little
more on the quality of their
programs than on the size of
ihair membership list they would
he, better oﬂ. May 1 be spe<
Ciafl’c for one moment and say
{hat I may love the quality of

not much fun to dance to on
the Dancing in the Dark prrr
rrtam on Friday evenings

Hopefully yours,

She exhibited her dramatic abil-
ity in her operatic selections,
and we wished more of these
had been included in the pros
gram.

High points of the concert
were one Cimara “Song of
Spring” and the aria l-rom “The
Medium." or the German group,
the song from the Schumann
Cycle “Fraunliebe Und Leben"
was perhaps the most expres-
sively sung,

The well-remembered
“Amour viens Alder." from
“Samson and Delilah,” whichi
Miss Turner sang as one of her

Senator McConhy of Wiscon-
sin is prohably the most hated
and worshiped man in our gov-
ernment. Every time he opens
his mouth he adds to his own
immortality, although it hasn't
been often lately.

He never says very much but
he knows how to hint around;
he doesn't know very much but
he has. some powerful hunches.
People like McCarthy are called
demagogues.

One thing McCarthy’s critics
overlook though, is that demae
gogy can be a lot of fun—for
the demagoguc, at least. I
know. I’ve had the time of my
life for the past ten weeks.

But now it‘s almost Christmas
and everything takes on a sort
of warm glow. Everyone turns
1nto a good Joe: Dick Tracy and
Mrs, Pruneface will probably
exchange gifts; Li'l Abner will
smile at Daisy Mae; Jiggs and
Maggie will kiss and make up;
Mr, Baumann might even deliv-
er a lecture on international re-
lotions.

! can’t buck precedent
that. so . . . . .

To our five marvelous paint-
ers, the gang at Okoboji, Jackie
.omnson, Leo Durocher, the

Dibble eagle, the Haines hall

Weitz and his itchy heed, Rick
Fiedorowicz, Chuck Dunham and

To Dr. and Mrs. Stevens, Del
Robison, Fred Baumann, the
Mew-of Rawson hall, the wait—
ressts at the Three Elms, Jim
Morgan and his council, Pete
Carlton and his rats, Harry

and all the turtles and goldfish
on south campus—

To our shivering preps, sock-
