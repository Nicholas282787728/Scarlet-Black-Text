indicate that no planning group
has ever considered this cycle‘
in solving the problem.

The strugzle with prepping ,
g has not only been between the
“aid tradition" and the “new
Grinnell" but also between an .
ideal college life and social
order as seen by the admini—
stration and reality as .evir
danced in the character of the
students admitted here.

The programs set forth by
the administration or planned.
under its guidance have been{
for college students anxious to,
create an ideal sociéty and to
live in’an academic world. The.
majority of the men, however,‘
seem more anxious to live in
a world masculinesby their de—
finition, free from the restraint.
of home and family and inl
which wild emotionrl‘ather than
reason rules. Perhaps either
view is an exaggeration, ‘but

- the results when the two come
together are basically the same.

This is the reason that no
program instituted in the past
has had the whole—hearted sup—'
port of either students or,
faculty. A minority of students,
usually joined with faculty in
opposing all prepping, but '
years when the programs were
especially harsh, this group bes
came a _ma]ority and brought;
about change.

When any group has attempt—1
ed to define the purpose and.
goals of a prepping progi-am,l
it has invariably included ihc‘
word ”adjustment." Prepping
was to be a process in which
the freshman “adjusts" to an
adult and college community.

We are, therefore, impelled
to examine the motivations, if
any, for Russia even to con-

. sider the possibility of a sur-

prise nuclear attack. News-
woek magazine stated this
summer that if there was a
surprise attack, we would be
hurt, but Russia would be

The words ”radioactive heap"

overstatement. it is certain that

freshmen to a specific pattern.

Some wanted
individuals who participated in
“cultural, athletic and social"
activities. Some wanted “Schu-
lars", some, ”good time She
lies,” and some, “intellectuals."
No one seems to have question-
ed who rightfully should cast
the die. on if this is a privilege
which anyone should have.

In these many programs few

There is also the problem,
in a community such as this
in which the character of the
halls and the campus change
each year, of initiating a pr

changes. ‘
