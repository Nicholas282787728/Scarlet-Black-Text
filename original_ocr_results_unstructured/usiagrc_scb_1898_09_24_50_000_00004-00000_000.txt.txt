The material for our football
team is gradually shaping itsclt
and taking on the appearance of
real learns. The competition for
positions this (all stronger
than last year and few, if any.
seem to have a “sure thing."
This lively competition is, in part,
the cause of a very commendable
spirit shown by most of the play-
ers, especially among the new
men, though some of the older
players are still lacking along
that line It is greatly to he
hoped that those will lose no time
in getting thoroughly waked up
to the work on hand.

All this week Coach Harris has
given thcrn scrnc signal practice
in addition to their morerudimen-
tary work of running, tackling,
etc. The men have learned their
positions in the interference very
readily but ﬁnd it extremely difﬁ-
cult to apply their knowledge
when having oppositionl

Wednesday atternoon the teams
lined up tor their opposition work
and have had some of this every
day since. Like all teams in their
ﬁrst practice, the work was loose
and ragged, but was also spirited.
Both lines were weak on the dc-
tense, allowing too much work to
fall on the backs. The hardest
kind of work must be employed
to improve this, it we would stop
the heavy teams that we are to
meet this ‘scason. The backs in
turn are slow in starting and in
taking advantage of openings.

in the later practices so tar
there has been a little improve-
ment along some lines both in den
fensive and offensive work. The
backs are carrying the ball better
and the interference has better
form but has not increased its
speed as much as might be de—

is

 

sired. However, ifall would show
the spirit and desire for improve-
ment exhibited by most of them
we could look for a very marked
gainin all lines during the next
week.

With the beginning at opposi-
tion work the interest and num-
bers of the spectators have great
ly increased, though much larger
crowds would be welcome, during
all of the practice. The attendants
are asked, however, not to crowd
in on the players, but to give
them a little more room to exe-
cute their plays than they have
had so far this season. The propr
er place for the spectators is not
in front or behind either team as
in that case the ball cannot be
kicked with safety. Nor is their
place close on theside of the team
as they cannot get any formation
on end runs nor see how their
opponents are playing. Their
place is rather at such a distance
from the teams that the players
can have a chance to see what is
going on and how to make each
and every play without hindrance
from the bystanders. It is cer-
tainly of more importance tor the
players to be able to see this than
tor the spectators. A good at-
tendance is a great incentive to
good work on the part at the
players but the interest in the
plays must not lead to obstruct-
ing theml
