Buckle up for Punk
Football, long-lost Sauce

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Staff Writer

Two bands, American Football
and Speed of Sauce. are scheduled
to perform in Gardner lounge Saturn
day night. Sponsored by the SGA
Concerts Committee, the Gardner
concert will expose Grinnellians to
original music tinged with inﬂuences
of punk, emo, and even pop.

Of the two groups to play, Ameri-
can Football is perhaps the most
widely traveled. Hailing from Chis
cage, the newly formed band is cur
rently establishing a name for itself
amidst midwestem punk culture.
Despite the band's newness, recog-
nition is aided by the fact that singer
and guitarist Mike Kinsclla used to
drum forCap‘nIazz,aChicagopunk
band.

According to Matt Ryan ‘00, a
member of Concerts Committee, the
music ofAmerican Football is “me-
lodic and midrtempo, with interest-
ing song structures.“ Ryan compared
the style of American Football to that
of Promise Ring and Joan of Arc.
noting “ems-melodic“ tendencies in
all three bands.

Although Ryan cited emo as an
“offshoot of punk.” he added that one
major difference between emo and
punk is that emo is “not as offensive.
There's a lot of angry stuff and more
of a pop inﬂuence..,[Essentiallyi,
emo is really welledone punk with
[more of a pepsinﬂuenced] melody,
i never met anybody Who didn‘t like
emo." ,
Stylistic inﬂuences of Speed of

Sauce, the second band to play Sate
urday, are perhaps less casy to cats
egonze than ihoseofAmciicnn Foot-
ball. Comprised ofMark Paulscn ‘00
and Wes Philips, Phil Moorc, and
Adam Bcrnemann. Speed of Sauce
has been through dramatic changes
since its ﬁrst incarnation as the band
Vivid seven years ago. “Every show
I've heard titem play has been dir-
ferent from the last." said Ryatt.

Perhaps tlus is partly due to the
changing tastes ofthe band members.
Vivid was formed when Paulscn was
still in seventh grade, attending
middle school in Grinnell. At that
time. the other band members also
went to school with Paulsen. Since
then. the band has undergone several
evolutionary steps involving new
members and new music, as well as
the challenge of current members
attending different schools. The
most recent change was the acquisi-
tion of a new drummer, Bernemann,
last summer.

For Saturday's concert,
Bernemann will not be present. In»
stead, Rob Felty ‘01, the drummer
from Orpheus, will hold down the
percussion.

Despite the band'sjumblcd evo-
lution. their current focus is clear:
“We‘re interested in people shake
ing booty." said Paulsen. indeed,
with songs like “Cup," “Reminder."
and “Loos'e Booty,“ this mission my
play itself out,

The American Football and Speed
ofSauee concert is set to begin at to
PM Saturday in Gardner lounge.

Unlike most Grinnell seniors who
are counting the days until they
leave, David Lukowski ‘98 is look-

Lukowski hasn’t been held back:
he'll be spending his fall semester
student teaching as part of the 9th se-
mester in Education program and his
spring semester painting. Lukowski

“This Fellowship has provided
several studio students with the op
portunity to really build portfolios
that make them competitive for
graduate school study," said An Pro»
fessor Anthony Crowley. “We ask
them to make a contribution to the
college by helping teach the students
and lecture. In return, the student
receives the opportunity to stay in
Grinnell to work, a small stipend and

will ever be able to draw or paint

mester. That’s the best part of it.
Anyone can draw ifthey put enough

different places."

Lukowski. who would eventually
like to teach art and coach baseball
at the high school level. feels that the
Fellowship in

could open up
some opportu-

A capella performance is one that
takes place without any musical ac-

the gentle alteration of voices, from
early tworpart songs to ﬁn-de-siecle
pieces eager to break into the larger

The group's music contains finely
honed virtues, a sonic purity and a
deﬁnite sense of purpose. One is ad-

and musical complexities. Their pus

impress and astonish anyone who lisr

places of Jerusalem. Rome and
Compostela were visited by scores
of pilgrims from all over Europe.
Compostela was the legendary burial
place of St. James, who was the first
apostle to die a martyr. Known as a
miracle worker. his tomb attracted
and continues to draw a multitude of
visnors seeking physical and spiri-
tual healing. Most ofthe works in this
collection are plain chant for feasts
of St. James, and are speciﬁcally li-
turgical. Almost all of the polyphonic
works are written in a roughly note-
against-note style, but some are com-
posed in a ﬂoral “organal” style, in
which the soloist sings free, map-
sodic lines against the long held notes
of the chant. The music in this selecr
tion is enchanting and will keep the
audience spellbound throughout the
duration of the performance,
TheAnonymous 4 have managed
to carve a niche for themselves in the
highly competitive world of early
music performance. Their perfor-
mances have been said to contain,
”such lyricism, vividness and a sense
of wide-eyed wonder that the listener
is immediately transported to a more
ethereal World." The New York
Times has summed up this musical
wonder by saying. “There is justice
in the world after all. for these are
wonderful performers: distinctive

personalities with individual voices,
who by dint of hard work blend Willi
superb balance and unearthly purity.“

Part seventeen in an on-going

series Of KDIC

Vetern DJ Mike F agarty is on the
“I‘he High Life” on Tuesdaysfram
1:00-2:10. Mike has some interest-
ing things to say. but, more impor-
tantly, he is interested in what the
campus can tell him.

K.N.: What kind ofmusic do you
play?

M. :anz, Acid Jazz and com-
binations thereof. But lately I have
played a lot of variety, like today I
played the Police and the Dave
Matthews Band.

K. - Wouldyuu say that you use
your music or KDIC'X music more?

Mn: 1 pretty much use my own
music. Lately, I have been getting
my room-
mate, Seth
Porcieu ‘00,
to help out.
We have a
lot of music
and, to be
h o n e s t ,
there isn’t
enough at
the station
to play on
my show.
There is a
lot of good
stuff, but it
isn‘t what I
am inter-
ested in.
Sometimes
we dig
through the record ﬁle, though. the
music we want to play is usually
hard to ﬁnd.

K.N.: Why did you call 1'! “The
High Ltfe”?

MF: Well, it is not really about
being high. I don’t know how to
say it. it is kind of like being on
top of the world, just kind ofen-
joying things. It‘s about being laid
back and taking things easy. I
can’t even begin to describe it.

K.N.: Sounds kind oflike an ab-
rtract thing.

M.F.: Definitely an abstract
thing that I just can’t seem to ex-
plain. We try to explain that more
on the show.

K.N..- So, what do you ray in
people who think it is all about get-
ting ltt‘gli?

M F.: We pretty much let them
draw their own conclusion. That
is tor them to ﬁgure out. They are,
after all, the radio audience. What
are we going to tell them? They
need to decide what they will about

my show. Whatever, as long as they
listen we are cool with it.

KN: Do you gel a lot of listen-
ers calling in?

ME: I guess the only way you
can tell that you have listeners at
all is by the phone calls you get.
We usually get a few phone calls
per Show. I think thal sometimes
it depends on when you have your
show. Night time shows get more
calls.

K.N.: Do you ever broadcast
people?

M.F.: Not all the time. Usually I
don’t do it unless I know somone
has something to say because
sometimes it
can be awk-
w a r d .
People don’t
like to be on
the radio. I
have asked a
lot of people,
but they
don’t want
to get on the
radio. It is
hard to get
people to
have a con-
versation on
air. It can get
to the point
Where it is a
o n e — 5 id e d
v c o n v e r s a -
lion sometimes. People aren’t used
to the radio and they just don’t get
into it. Our policy is that if some-
one has something to say, we’ll put
them on air.

my: Do you take request: in-
stead? .

M.F.: Sure, we take requests. We
try to keep it roughly on the for-
mat. but we will take almost any
request as long as it is relevant.
Sometimes you just don’t want to
take requests, if you know what I
mean.

K.N.: You mean Frank Sinatra.

M.F.: Yes. Frank Sinatra. Iljust
doesn‘t work with hip-hop for
some reason. Who knows?

K,N,: What is your gonlfor your
show?

M.F.: Goal? I suppose the goal
is that we hope that people don’t
always know what we are going to
play. We hope that people are ex-
posed to more music. That is my
vision of college radio.
