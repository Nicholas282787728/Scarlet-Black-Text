Committee Rejects
Financial Plan for
Proposed Annual

A move to have a portion of
each Student’s room deposit set
aside to finance the publication
of a year book next year has
been rejected, President John S,
Nollen has informed Helen Kolyn,
president of the present sopho-
more class, which plans to pub-
lish the annual next year.

A portion of the letter from
Nollen to Miss Kolyn said, “I
took up with the committee the
question that you raised with me
the other day about using part
of the room deposit for an annual
next year.

“There seemed to be two serir
ous objections to this suggestion,
the first being that the committee
does not consider it fair to impose
a charge upon the entire student

body for a hook which only a,

portion of them will be willing to
buy.

“The second is that, under pres-
ent conditions, a great many of
the room deposits are either
totally or almost used up by the
end Of the year, and the propo—
sition put before us would
amount practically to asking our
business office to act as a col-

lection agency during the summer,

for the amount that would be
allocated to the annual.”

Concluding the letter, Nollen
advised the class to look else-
where for a subvention that
would make the publication of a
year book possible.

The sophomores now plan to
ask the board of trustees to give
an annual fund out of the general
fund which the trustees appor-
tion each year. The board meet-
ing is scheduled for June 1.

Under this plan, if a profit is
made, 50 per cent will be turned

into an annual fund and the rerI

maining 50 per cent would go
to the class for its use.

Present plans call for the pub»
lication of a lisepage annual
costing $2,970 to publish. Salaries

, for students working on the pub
lication are figured into this gen»
eral estimate, Miss Kolyn said.

A staff has
work on the year book and will

draw up a thumbnail sketch of
the proposed publication by May

15, and will submit it to the
trustees June 1, she said.
