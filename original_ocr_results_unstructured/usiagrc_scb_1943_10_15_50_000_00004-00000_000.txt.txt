Playoffs Nex’r Week
To Decide Championship

By BILL FOX

Once again the college touch-
gridders bowed to defeat, this
time by a score of 13-6 at the
hand of the ‘ILaliztns,’ Cowles
Hall. Filst blood was drawn by
the college men on a 40 yard
return of an interception to pay
dirt and 6 points by Jack Cran-
dall. This was to be the first
and last time the Macy Men were
to score.

Immediately follow .g the kick-
off, the Cowles outfit put on the
pressurc.A series of devastatingly
accurate passes resulted in a
march to the college twenty.
There, another bullet heave l-er
suited in the army's first six
points. A pass scored the extra
point too, leaving the college on
the short end of a 7-6 score.

The remainder or the second
quarter and almost the rest of
the game prov an exciting
but pointless bait c, with neither
team managing to get into the
clear. With darkness closing in,
howevei, the aimy got the ball]
on its own 20. Two plays gainrr
ed a first down. Then a long
pass into the left flat sent a GI
scurrying for the college goal
line, far ahead of all pursucrs.
The army failed to make the ex»
tra point, and the game ended
soon with the army on top, 13-6.

Weekly Love Notes: How things
are going with .the woman over
at the quad definitely affects the
appetite of a soldier. Trainee
Nuke had a little spat with Har-
riet Cooke. when it came chow
itime, he just nibbled. Trainee
Wyman, on the other hand, is;
going strong with Jeanette'
undxtmm And his appetite
knows no bounds. Wyman made
sure to sit next to Noke at
meals and thus procure enough
calories for energy expended.
But now Noke and Harriet are
patched up again. Poor Wyman
is walking around with a hung»
ry look.

Trainee Gridney has been very
secretive about the blonde he
sees continually. When we asked
him for her name. (he knew we
wanted to print it) Gidney bril-
liantly answered "Her
name? . . . Mrs. Gidney." Now,
now Gidney, we know you're in
bad shape but it hasn’t gone
that far? 7 '1 9

continued last Sunday with the
game staged by the Read l—lall
footbal Squad. The squad was
dwided into two trains, with Ed-
gar Lash leading one and Phi]
nuhcr the other. The teams
[ought valiantly to gain an ad-
vantagc over the other.

The final scorc was 2 to o in
favor of Lash’s team. The lone
score was the rcsult of an auto-
matic safety caused by a poor
center to tullback Joe Haas which
caused him to tumble in the end
zone. However, Haas and Kolko,
both of Huber’s eleven, gave out
standing performances. For the
other side, Baird and Rovegno
came through with their usual
hard playing which caused no end
of trouble for the other team.

The closelyrcontcsted game was
not surprising as the teams were
composed of men who were well
acquainted with their opponents.
As a matter of fact, each side
knew the other’s plays.

The linerups were:

Basic Team 1 Basic Team 2
