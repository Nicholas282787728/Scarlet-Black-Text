QEDit-Jrial

DITING a college paper is a nice
thing. If we publish jokes,
people say we are rattledrlleadeﬂ. If
we don’t, we are fossils. It we pub-
lish original matter, they sny we don’t
give them enough selections. Ifwe
give them selections. they say no are
too lazy to write. II we write an oc-
casiollnlstory with any rereicnce ln
cupid in it, we1 are fussers. 1r ne ii;-
ilore [he Co-ods, we are llomeil hitters.
Ifweremuiu at the oilice, we ought
to be out looking for non-s items. If
we go out, then we are not attending

with one exception have not lieeiioi

one which will make Llle blood Lingle
and which will be exciting every moV

which needs no apology but does need

Very noticeable that at all of our pub-
