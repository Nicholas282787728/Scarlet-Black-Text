Commen’rs on Kohn

Agree with Hans Kohn or not, as you please;
but at least you can’t ignore him.

That may very well be the best com-
pliment we of Grinnell college can pay to
this mail who has been talking with us this
past week. To listen and to assimilate knouu
ledge in a art of amoebic lethargy is characr
teristic of a pupil. To listen and to appraise,
to criticize, that is the test of a student.
Undoubtedly some pupils came to those lecc
tures and went away pupils, muttering hap—
pily and for the moment, “00000 a he’s
wonderful." Some students, whether faculty
members or undergraduates, came and went
away as more alert students. But we think
the best result of the history lectures is that
a. few, a Very few perhaps, but still some
pupils came and went away as students.

This is no great revolution in the intcls
lectual life of Grinnell, and we are not at-
tempting to overemphasize it as suchCBut

the fact that Dr. Kohn made some of us so
doggone mad that we went home to Light
with our roommates about appropriating
the stocks of German industries # well, it’s
a situation more important because of its
litl‘lty.

We don’t agree with everything Dr.
Kolln said, At least we don‘t agree with it
PM; because he said it, He wouldn’t want
us to. and that is good, If there have been
any “conversions" to his way of thinking
during this history lecture series, they have
been made not because he is an “expert"

ins-e rules are to be considered second only
to these laid down by Moses and F.D.R., but
because he has inspired a little individual
thinking.

A lot of values have been re-u‘eighed

'nir the past weeli Some “economists”

e begun to wonder if the imports and
exnor s of a nation are really the only stan»
dard,for judging its success; and the mouths
01 quite a 'l'ew undergraduate “idealists”
dronlled open when it occured to them that
maybe politics, not ethics, would determine
the peace. The general eaction of students
has been one of selfcexamination.

We can think of no better estimate of
Hans Kohn’s worth to lls than that fact
alone. Thele is such a convenient escape
from thought in the condition of war. Our
generation can glibly say: we are going
to do the fighting, our futures are insecure,
we shall not waste time worrying about the
future of the world; someone else can work
out the peace, we probably won’t be here
to see it anyway.

That attitude of disinterest suffered a
definite setback in the past week. We hope
it is a permanent one, and there is evidence
to support that hope. Grinnell college stun
dents, who three years ago learned to res-
pect Hans Kohn for his own abiding faith

‘ in good things, have this year been able to

add to their respect a gra ude for the sugv
gestion of a sensible faith in them,

The result, or-ccursc, was that
the fire department went dii-ccdy
to the Spencer Brcy home, forms
arly cccupied by Gates ball, but
new empty. One of the firemen
remembered seeing a crowd con-
grcgstiiig around Cci-iicy house,
and only c few seconds were lost
by the understcndchlc contusion.

The original fire in the second
floor room was soon under con-
trol. but iii-cinch soon found that
the rafters between second and
third door were burning. A hose
and several sires prevented the
danger of the fires spread. At
1:15 the fire was technically out,
and Eredimus. Welch and Hult—

of their room.

not been made as yet, awaiting
the arrival of an insurance inc
