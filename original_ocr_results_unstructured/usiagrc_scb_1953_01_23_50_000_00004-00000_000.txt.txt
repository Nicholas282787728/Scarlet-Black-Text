Slants on Sports

by George Simon

Something unusual is happening at Gi‘innell. Wevc got two
winning athletic teams ﬂ and both at the same time. I’ll talk
about Il‘V Sinlone‘s undefeated swimmers sometime in the lu-
ture, but let’s stick to basketball today.

S—OrS

At the beginning 01 the current campaign, a poll of Midwest
conlercnce cage coaches picked Carleton to take first, Grinnell
to finish last. To date, they are half right. Carleton is first, but
St. Olaf is last. And upstart Grinnell is second.

The Pioneers have gathered momentum alter dropping three
of their first five games, and tonight will be trying to preserve
rr precious four game win streak.

They have beaten the lenders in three separate confers
ences — Iowa Teachers in the North Central league, Central
in the southern division of the Iowa 100)), and Cornell when
the Rams were atop the Midwest standings before Christmas.
Grinnell’s record of six ‘wins, three losses is third best in‘ the
state, and its ﬁeld goal shooting percentage is 12th among the
nation's small colleges. ,

That’s a perfect reversal from this same time last year
when the record in the conference was 173 rather than 3-1, and
3—5 over all against the present 6-3.

This chain of events has startled everybody —- everybody but
John. Piitsch and 13 basketball players.

At the beginning of the season Grinncll’s sports publicity
director assured me that we weren't going to win many games
—we didn’t have a good team. That lupinion was excusable
their; he was going by past records, lBut this same iellcw tre-
peated the same thing just one week ago—despite the statis-
tics staring him in the eye. Now he's finally begun to lchange
his mind.

This attitude seems‘to be typical among Grinnell students.
Our teams have lost so much ﬁol‘ so long that when at last we
find a winning combination. we won’t believe it.

S—O-‘S

Coach Piitsch is very enthusiastic. He keeps talking about

the ”new era of athletics” which is coming to Grinnell. He thinks

' Cowles

 

his eager-s are starting a long sought for “winning tradition."
Maybe so.
