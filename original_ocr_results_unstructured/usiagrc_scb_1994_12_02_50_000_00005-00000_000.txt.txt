Orr-Campus
Movies This
Weekend

By AMANDA

HORNBUCKLE
Arts Editor

Well, folks. it's an unusual
weekendinthemoviedepartment.
First of all, since it's once again
Waltz time,there’s no Saturday
night movie in Harris (Waltz is
better anyway). Also, the Films
Committee must have been on a
Joe Pesci kick when they made
the schedule, because he’s fea-
luredinbothofourmoviechoiees
this weekend, Personally, he’s
not my favorite actor, but if you
likehim,you’regonna haveaball
with these two.

With Honors

Friday 11! 7:30 p. m. andSlmday at
3:00 p.m,, Harri: Cinema

AccordingtoLisaAlexander,
SGA Films Chair, this movie is
based onthetrue storyofaHarvard
student who takes in a homeless
man (Joe Pesci) after losing his
senior thesis. She says that it’s
suppose to be “really deep and
good," and I‘ve heard good re
ports from other sources, The
promo said that it‘s “wonderful
andfunny," and don‘tyou always
believe them?

Again according to Lisa, this
flickis afunny look atzi slum lord
(guess who) who spends a month
living in and experiencing one of
his own buildings. Ms.FilmClialr
recommends it, saying, “this
movie is very funny!” Junior
Adam Sales commented that it‘s
not Joe Pesci at his best (is there
really such a thing?), but it has
some good oncrliners scattered
throughout the movte, Said Adam
7 and you must realize that the
boy is stressed — “Overall. I'd
recommend a game of hide-and-
go-seek in the science building
first (ya know there's just not
enough socializing in that build
ing), but if you have trouble find»
ing sufficient people and have
nothing else to do, then go and
check it out. On a scale of L6,]
give it an “e" (for the nonrmath
people,e=2.8)sotguessit’sabout
average!" So there you have it
Joe Pesci fans celebrate.
