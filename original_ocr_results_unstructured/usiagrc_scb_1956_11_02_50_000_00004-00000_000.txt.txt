“ Yeah! Rah! Team! ” II

The cheerleaders were victims of this column several
\ieeks ago. As a result, spectators must have thought that
tl'ey were perfect fans in boosting spirit at football games
This was not the case at the Parents’ Day game.

The cheerleaders showed

signs of practice, and good

spirit They are making- excellent progress. Cheers were

cheerleaders got littlerul' no

pubic address system felt compelled to urge spectators to

Homecoming is a perfect time to demonstrate spir’ .
Men will be in high spirits homecoming eve, while halls
etinstl'uct decorations. The prevailing carnival atmosphere
should extend into the football game.

Naturally, it is harder to cheer a losing- team. Its twice
as hard for the team to play at its peak, when no one seems

Calalla/ Commentary

\s promiscd last wcck, wc arc
riiout to prcsrnt you with the
nest equivocal analysis ot a
P idential election ever wit-
n ed hy newspaper rcaders.
F'csident Eisenhower will have
minimum plurality of a hall
n llli . , but this does mt
n-cnn that lic , ‘- hoari , for
a second term, ‘

Sllcll an event is, ol course,
not without precedent, with
llnycs, through a. manipulated
election hccoining President
on thc short end of the papur
hr volc, and Benjamin Harris
Son rcpcnting thc feat over
Grover Cleveland in 1888. By
an odds this will probably be
one of the weirdcst elections
in American history anyway,
with one candidate running
in ahead of his pnriy, nnd thc
other running,~ slightly behind
his.

in addition to this, thc fact

First or all. ike Will lose by
slimmer majorities in the South
than any other GOP candidate
in many n year, thcugh 1052 he
will. Thcn. if Stevenson carries
the key states cf California and
Pennsylvania, it will be by so
little that the majorities will be
microscopic. Finally, in the
Midwcst. with the exception of
lllmcis and Minnesota, Ike will
win by such lliumping majorir

I am almost convinced that

of physical good looks has can .

ried over into the presidential
campaign, and that nrwspapcrs
and lnagazmes havc not hesitab
cd to capitalize on it. For
stancc, it's almost a rule these
days that no publication in sup.
port of lkc can find a good
picturc oi Adlai Stevenson.

in;

A typicnl example of the
way stcvcnson is shown to
tlic public is the head-and-
slionlders picture that depicts
him as having rive chills, hor-

rible bags under the cycs and
teeth exposed in a grin that
seems to betray ' intentions
oiliutching nninsi ious plot to
ruin the farmer, weaken nnr
iionnl deiensc and plunge the
world into chaos,

Then there is the often-used
picture ct Adlai in a crowd nl
pcople, being pushcd and Show
rd, with one arm outstretched
and a look of cgony that sugr
gcsts to the reader emotional
insecurity and a personal hatred
oi the masscs. And thc nnii.
Stevenson reader sees the clam-
cring crowd as a mob of angry
voters, holding the candidate at
bay wliilc someonc runs for the
tal‘ and feathers,

Compare these with some of ,
the over-obvious attempts to ;
porirny Eisenhower as the ;
kind old grand-dad (the se-
quence niintos oi Ike in var-
ious attitudes ol thought, the
victorious “praised nrms, the
kind smile beneath the wrinr
liled brow). Are wc supposed
to get the impression thnt l

‘Arﬁsi .Stcvc‘nsohzmpnigns {or
the sole purpose oi displnying
his bad case oi the uglies?

Granted that Adlai is
glamour-boy. but he did manage
to look rather appealing _ I
might gc so tar as to say
“clcaircrit"_on TV during the
rnnvcnhcn. and the Democratic
publications seem to be able to
rind some gch picturcs at him.

The picture cnmpnign for
Ike seems to closcly resemble

to make n got! at James Dean
or the newspaper attitude to
ward Grace Kelly. (Are w.
supposed to get the iinpressioi
that she is princess of Mama
by divine right based on he
good looks?

But on the other hand, 1 thin

ties that when all the counts al‘Ei
in. he may well have a popularl
plurality and still lose the elec-l
tioll.

Willi this equivocation ac-
complished, let’s look at the
specifics oi the electoral cul-
lcgc. Since nil the pundits and
national pollsters levm' Ike,
we have some reservations,
