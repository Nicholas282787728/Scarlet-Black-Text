By RIVA SHARPLES

N keeping with a long-standing
I Grinnell tradition, President

Pamela Ferguson delivered the
ﬁrstscholar‘sconvocation oftheacan
demic yw yesterday in Herrick
Chapel, The theme of Ferguson’s
speech was the role of Grinnellians in
past frontiers and those of the future.

Ferguson talked about the
college'shistory asawny of seeing the
school‘s future

“As we face the sesquicentennial
ofGrinnell College nextyear, wemust
look backward into the past to see the
future," she said.

Grinnell College was established
in 1846asIowa CollegeinDavenport.
Iowa, during an era of expansion and
new ideas, Ferguson said

“In 1346, 80 percent of the popun
lation was rural. Railroads were just
beginning to develop and the country
asawhole was inanexpansive mood."

The collegewasprogressive from
its beginning and quickly became too
liberal for its surroundings, according
toFergusonr in 1861, the tiny college
moved from Davenport to Grinnell
and took on the town's name, though
only ofﬁcially three yeats ago,

“It was the mid-18005 and the

prevailing attitude in the South and in
much of the Unit/ed States was that
slavery was a permanent and God-
willed institution and that slaves were
actually happy in bondage. The col»
lege was being harassed because of its
anti-slavery attitude and its stance on
temperance."

As proof of Grinnell’s liberal ber
girtnings, Ferguson pointed out that
women and African-Americans were
some of the ﬁrst students to attend
Grinnell.

“Though there are no exact

records, it appears that a former slave
was enrolled and doing well at Grin—
nell as early as 1371,” she said.

In 1861,when the college opened
for classes in its new location of Grin-
nell, there were several women enn
rolled in a two-year ladies’ course,
accordingtoFerguson. There wastalk
at that time about letting women pur-
suea full-ﬂedged degree and, in 1867,
the first bachelor of arts degree was
awarded to a woman. she said

As the college enters its sesquin
centennial year, Grinnelliarrs facesimi-

of the college's first students, said
Ferguson.

Today’s Grinnellians must deal
with problems within the social and
economic institutions of the United
States, Ferguson said, Those “fron-
tiers" that will need help include edu
cation. the medical field, public ser-

vice and the media, said Ferguson,
though she was quick to clarify that
she was notreferring to the Scarlet and
Black when criticizing the media.

Grinnellians are the future, said
Ferguson.

“Who will solve the problems?

ADMISSIONS from page 1

Some students had to resubmit
their federal forms which in turn
caused them to apply late or caused
their file to be incomplete.

Associate Dean of Admissions
James Lincoln explained the situa-
tion.

“Due to the changes in the federal
regulations,wewantedtobesurethat
all students were given equal oppor»
tunity to enroll," he said.

But this year‘s report from the
Committee for Admission and Fi»
nancial Aid indicated that Grinnell
had become more selective during
the past year. This spring 2,299
students applied for admission and
only 54% were accepted, compared
to the 2,212 thatapplied and the 68%
that were admitted last year.

Although Grinnell is dcceasing
the number of students admitted, the
report also revealed an increase in the
numberofincomingmulticulturalstu-
dents. Eleven percent enrolled last

fall while this ymr the percentage
increased by four percent.

Students have noticed.

Junior Randy Edgell said, “i see
the school is really bringing more
student of ethnicity to Grinnell.”

President Pamela Ferguson said
that over the past couple of years the
Office of Enrollment has made it
their priority to bring more diversity
to Grinnell while maintaining the
academic quality.

"We are pleased that the percenlr
age of diversity has gone up and by
having more applicants we can craft
more interesting classes,”

ANNIVERSARY from page 1
—LESS was formed to increase
awareness of highway safety and
gender violence. Self»defenseclasses
and emergency car repair workshops
are now offered in Grinnell every
year.

The search for Zywicki's mur-
derer continues. Wanted posters are
available in the post office
