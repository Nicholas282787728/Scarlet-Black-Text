SELF-SATISFIED SUFFICIENCY

A Grinnell student remarked the other day, “I don’t
pay any attention to news#what do I care what happens,
so long as it doesn’t affect me?" A Grinnell faculty mem-
ber says she doesn’t know anything about national affairs,
and thinks anyone who does would be a queer person.
These are extreme examples, but nevertheless most of us
show a tragic lack of interest in vital social problems. _

When such a situation can exist at an educatlonal 1n-
stitution in a year of crises, something is radically wrong
With national elections approaching and great problem,
far from solved, there is no place for this complacent in»
difference. The problems of unemployment, bankrupt
farmers, exploited labor, maldistributioli of wealth, crime
and graft, armaments, and others call to all Americans and
especially to the educated for solution. ,

‘ Although Grinnell is buried deep in the midst of a
comparatively isolated continent, there is no reason why
we should be indifferent to World problems, Italy and
Britain, Japan and Russia and China, Germany and
France are almost at each other’s throats, Elitangllng al-
liances and hate in Europe make it almost impossible for
Germany, Italy, France, Russia, Britain, Austria, Czecho-
slovakia or Poland to keep out of any European war. Not
only is the war threat calling to all for solution, but there
are also the problems of national states, restricted trade,
and unequally divided economic resources

Any person who, without trying, says he cannot do
anything about these problems is a cowardly weakllng, and
any person who is carelessly blind to the problems Just be-
cause they do not affect him directly, is a self-cent}??? fool,

G
FRESHMAN POLICIES

When all the smoke of discussion concerning freshman
policies has cleared away, one fact seems to stand out clear»
ly, There is no consistent policy whatsoever regarding
freshmen

Until last year, the policy was one of thorough. ”prep-
.ping” with its rituals of caps, “buttoning,” indiscrlmlnatc
paddling, duties, and hell—week, This system lent itself to
abuses, and as a result, it was abolished by the Council of
House Presidents.

Quite admittedly it is difficult to enforce any system
of freshman duties without some paddling. The experienccs
of the past year are ample proof of this fact. \

At the present moment there appears to be a rather
ill-defined attempt to restore some of the old paddling. The
Council of House Presidents, together with the Honor G,
has given its tacit consent to paddling of recalcitrant fresh-
men by the members of the house councils for infractions
of rules reported by upper—classmen. '

‘ There is some basis for questioning the claim that the

' privilege of paddling a man increases his respect for the
paddler. Respect is a by-productof recognized accomplish-
ment, of freely acknowledged superiority, not of bodily
punishment. Granting that there exists a plethora of over-
inflated high school egos, freshmen would not be in college
were they not possessed of capabilities above the average,
Upper-classmen should be capable of directing and of util-
izing these abilities to the best advantage of the individual
freshman and of the college community as a whole. Pad-
dling, though it may effectively subdue effervescent egos,
certainly does nothing toward the development and utiliza-
tion of freshman abilities.

On the other hand, if we are to have freshman rules,
they must be enforced to the letter, Any other course is a
farce, There is, however, no excuse for the return of the
vicious type of indiscriminate, vengeful paddling of former
years. Let the various house councils hear all charges,
judge them, and administer reasonable discipline,

We do not advocate either one policy or the other. But
for the good of the school, let us recognize one policy and
make it stick. Choose either a complete cessation of all
rules, or make the existing rules effective, R
