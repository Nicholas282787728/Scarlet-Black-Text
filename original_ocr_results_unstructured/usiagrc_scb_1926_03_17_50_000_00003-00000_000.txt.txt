living who can appreciate all the mas
tcrpieces in the world; we respond to
a. limited ﬁeld. In art “It is much
more to your credit if you hunestly
don’t get it than it you say you do."

Carl Sandburg entered on the third
phase of his program by reading from
Col‘nhnskers, “Shenandoah” and "\Vil-
demess.“ "I am going to offer two
pieces written in American rather
than English language," he said Llry-
l)’. They were "Cahoo‘ts" and "Jazz
Fantasia." from Smoke and Steel. In
commenting on these he said that we
have future literature. He tllen read
“Prayers of Steel," Night Stuff,"
"Adelaide Cl‘opsey,” “Far Rockrarway
till Morning,” "SewWash," “Evening
Whtel‘lell,"anr1 the closing movement
of the {our iron the piece entitled
“Slabs ol the Sunburnt “Vest.” From
the hook "Slabs of the Sunbnrut West"
he read “This for the Moon—Yes?"
and “Primer Lesson.”

Tells oi “Bozo, Button Buster"

From "Rootabaga Pigeon," publish
ed about it year after the “Rootabagh
Stories,” he read “How Pink Peony
Sent Spuds the Ball-Player up to Pick
Four Moons,” as told by the Pata‘tu-
Face Blind Man. The other story
from this book for children was “How
Bozo the Buttonrhustel‘ Busted All his

 

Buttons when the Mouse Came," as
told by Hatracl: the Horse. The poetic
beauty in these stories seemed to cro-
ote .1 better impression with the and-
ience, outwardly at least, than some
or the poems read. such poetic ex~
pressions us “an Egyptian collar iroz-

 

en with diamond coo-webs, and a
golden moon with n blond-red autumn
leaf swimming in it" created an aud-
ible gusp of admiration umong the in-
tent listeners.

The songs perhaps created the least
favorable impression of all his pro-
gram, but they were well received.
in. Sandburg accompanied himself on
the guitar and sang a pickup song
about the Boll Weevil, what he term-
ed the American gutter song~zt
Frankie and Albert song, an Irish, n
negro and a cowboy song. He remark-
ed that if some of them had been in
French, Italian, or Spanish, ‘they
might have been included in grand
opera. He closed his program with a
negro spiritual in three parts, which]
had been taught him ‘by an old negro
mammy i2 years old.
