Norris’ Article

is Important,

Says Reviewer

November Tanager Includes
Steiner Travelogue;

Poetry Fair

By JANE MOORE.

If the aim of the Tanager as a
magazine of creative thought is the
achievement of orientation of con-
temporary expression, we feel that
the November issue approximates or
contributes that him rather (elicits
ously as for as the limits of a single
issue permit, with the possible ex-
ception of an underbalanced poetry
section.

There is a range of representation
from the expression of student
thought to the more mature presen»
tation of significant aspects of mod-
ern problems and ideas, which gives
the magazine an approach at least
1.0 the ideal of an integrated Whole,

Techll n1 Phases Handled \Vell

The conclusion of the article, "A
Philosophy of Life," the first portion
of which appeared in the September
Tanager by Prof. 1-1. w. Norris, com.
pletes what is perhaps the most sig—
nificant single Contribution. The de-
lightful manner in which Professor
Norris introduces the necessary
technical phases of the biological and
mechanistic views of life. so that the
layman understands the implications,
gives the ‘article a wide range of in—
terest.

The author has condensed in a
masterly fashion Within the limits of
a single article not only his own view
of life, a recognition of the living or-
ganism as a “a unity, a whole or his
teger" and as a material expression
of a spiritual force, but also the cut<
Tent mechanistic and vitalistic views
and their limitation.

Poetry Not Outstanding

The poetry in the issue does not
appear particularly outstanding, ex-
cept as it contributes to the comple-
tion of the thought cycle of the mage-
zine as a whole. Jay Signiund’s se-
quence, “The Mateless Plowman." does
catch rather effectively the groping
search of the plowmsn for expression
of sonow and loss, but one feels, at
times, that Mr. Sigmund has hound
himself up too tightly in contempla—
tion of rural tragedies to remain eith—
er the isolated half»iionic onlooker,
or to speak directly as his characters
would speak.

The two Short stories by Rebecca
canard and Alberta curtis, and the
reappearance of the Demi—Tasse sec
tion for shorter student contributions,
have a. real significance as the indi—
cation of a further step toward the
realization of the aim of the Tanager
as a Grinnell magazine, with the stu-
dents having a real part in its pro-
duction.

Steiner Writes Travelogue

The short stories. “Queer” and “The
Birthday Broom,” are admirably Well
done, and the sketches by Mary
Kout and Frances Rae are of more
than present interest in that they
pave the way for future contributions
of this type. The short story. "Music
of the Sun” by Thomas W. Duncan,
while presenting a good many im-
probabilities to the more critical
reader, achieves rather Well its aim
as a. short story. The short, almost
stacattc simple sentences in the first
Section of the story become a. trifle

irritating, however.

lnglis Urges Search for
Beauty of Individual at

Sunday Morning Service

That there is a hidden beauty in
every individual, and it is the duty
of everyone to discover this in him-
self and others was the context of
the sermon by the Rev. Robert Ing—
lis at the Grinnell Congregational
church Sunday morning.

Mr. Inglis, who is pastor of the
First 'Congregational church at Em-
poria. Kan, also spoke at the vesper
service in Herrick Chapel. There he
stressed the Utopian idealism, which
it is the college’s duty to give to We
ery student. He said that contrary to
the popular idea, idealism is worth-
while, antl each should strive to ob-
tain it. ,

Bullpups Use
Two Elevens

Drake
for Grinnell Game
Friday Night

Freshmen Practice

By LEIGHTON 300511
(Special to The Scarlet iuui Black) ,

DES MOINEsiDefeated by the'
Creighton yearlings in their only
game so far this season, the Drake
Bullpups are busy preparing to make
matters even by defeating the Grin-
nell freshmen in a game scheduled at
Ward field Saturday night.

Drake supporters remember last
year's topheavy freshman win over
the Pioneers, but reports from Grin-
nell indicate that the 1930 team is
far superior to the eleven which the
Bullpups defeated last season. Coach
Gibson Hollidsy's proteges were fort-
unate in holding the strong Blueiny
freshman aggregation to a 12 to 6
score.

Podrebnmc's Brother to Play

Holliday plans to continue his plan
of using two complete teams during
the fray. Drake has a pair of fresh-

Holding down the end berths in
the starting lineups will probably be
man-elevens that are almost equal in
strength, neither being called the

Grinnell Students Extend
Homecoming Celebration
With Victory Day Monday

Another victory day has come and
gone, but the cuts will never be for
gotten.

Bright and early Monday morning,
just after breakfast, the program be-
gan, After the men had joined forces
with the fair coeds of the Quad, the
group attended chapel service. Im-
mediately following, all retired to
Ward field to view the spoedball game
between two picked teams, one from
Smith, Langan, and Building Three,
and the other from Gates, Clark, and
Dibble.

The student body then paraded
down town and through the business
sdistrict to the Colonial theater.
There the students were entertained
by a Vaudeville program, each hall
and each cottage presenting an not.
A picnic lunch was served in front
of the men’s dormitories at noon. The
main feature of the afternoon was the
dance held in the woman’s gymnas-
ium from 2 o‘clock until 5. Music
was furnished by the Serenaders.

Special Rates Offered
for Washington Game

Students of Grinnell college will be
given special rates of lie for the
roundtrip to the Grinnell-Washington
football game at St. Louis Saturday
night. Those attending the game may
leave Grinnell at 10:32 Friday night
and return at 11:45 Sunday evening.

The rates were secured by Harry
Dunn, agent of the Minneapolis and
St. Louis Railroad company. The lid
amounts to less than the regular one-
way fare.

Appreciation of
Causes Stressed

in Gale Address

Need for appreciation of implica-
tions and underlying causes constitu-
ted the main theme of zone G'ele's
lecture Saturday afternoon in Herrick
chapel. Miss Gale's appearance was
'spnsored by .Theta Sigma Phi, wom-
en’s national journalistic fraternity,
and the college lecture course com<
mittee.

Miss“Gule, who is an American
author and critic. illustrated her
point by citing numerous instances
in which people missed the pictur-
esqueness of many customs and
works, since they failed to grasp
their hidden significance. She called
attention to the fact that many of
children's and elderly person‘s actions
are labeled as idiosyncracies, because
people do not interpret the under-
lying reasons.

In concluding her talk. Miss Cale
emphasized implications as the strong
and deeply stirring elements in writ-
ing by quoting and reading from her
own work.

EDITORIAL REPRINTED.

The Iowa Wesleyan News, college
newspaper, reprinted an editorial
in its
Monday's edition. The title was
“The Brazilian Revolution," and Ale

Lener Quartet
Program Here
is Justification

Blum Believes ‘Personality’
Compelling Feature
of Recital

By PROF. ELIAS BLUM
(School of Music Instructor)

The Loner string quartet of Budas
pest gave the first program of the
recital course last night in Herrick
chapel. The first appearance of this
splendid group in Grinnell Justified
the extravagant praise they have re-
ceived in European and eastern cells
tors.

It is idle to make comparison, but
there is no doubt that this quartet
ranks among the very first of the
world’s string ensembles.

Distinct Individuality

The program chosen was a consers
vative one, but no music ever written
for string quartet can surpass the
[period of Haydn and Mozart, and the
Schubert D minor quartet is a rare—
ly beautiful bit of music. In their
rendition of these well known num-
bers, the artists gave evidence of a
perfect ensemble, a rarely beautifull
tone quality from most captivating
delicacy to the powerfully sonorous
fortissimos.

As is always the case with true
artists, one felt a natural simplicity
in their interpretation of the music,
an adherence to the best traditions of
the art, but nevertheless a distinct
individuality. That intangible thing.
'personality, was the most compelling
feature of their performance.

Encore After Last Number

Many details might be taken as

-points of especial commendation.
such as the remarkable rendition of
the last movement of the Schubert
quartet, which. from the point of vir-
ltuosity and perfect ensemble, would
be hard to equal.
' Especial favorites with the audi-
ence were the lovely serenade from
the Haydn quartet. and the beau -
fully poetic rendition of the Tschai -
ovsky “Andante Cantabile," which
‘constituted the encore given after
the last number.

Clark S;ee dball Eleven

Gets Early Advantage to
Down Langan Outfit, 4-2

 

Clark hall nosed out the Langan
hall speedball team.’4 to 2, yesterday
afternoon. Langan lost the game on
:penalties and the failure to make its
only free kick count.

Craeber started the scoring with a
free kick early in the first quarter to
give Clark a one point lead, which
it held until the third quarter when
Fabian passed to Brookes over the
1 goal line for two points.

Clark regained its lead a few min-
utes later, when Holmes got a pass
over to Henderson, making the score,
3 to 2. During the last\quarter Frye
made another penalty kick good giv-
ing Clark its fourth point.

The Langan offense did not work
as smoothly as the Clark. The dee
fense stopped the Clark attack a
number of times, 'and effectively kept
the ball from the goal posts.

Miss Elisa Curtis, assistant pro-

portant port in Gary Cooper-s lifei
but in different ways.

At least that is the impression ob-
tained from reading a story in the
December number of Screen Play
Secrets in Which William Crouch.
former Grinnell student and class-
mate of Cooper, tells of the latter's
life in college here.

other member of the college faculty
to be given a place in the account of
Cooper's college activities. Mr. Mat-

Delegates to _
Attend Play

Perfect Alibi’
for Early Arrivals
at Press Meet

‘The Given

. T»

An added feature for the delegates
to the convention of the Iowa High
School Press association, which will
be held at Grinnell Nov. 1445, will
be the Grinnell chapter of the Na—
tional Collegiate Players’ presenta-
tion of “The Perfect Alibi,” the mods
ern mystery play of A. A. Milne.

Many of the journalists plan to ar»
rive Thursday evening in order to
see the play, which is being given
Nov. 1213 in the auditorium of
Alumni Recitation hall.

The action of the play c enters
about a. group of English people, who
are enjoying a weekend at a country
house in the south of England. While
most of the people are at a tennis
match a few miles away, and the
servants are all having the day off,
one of the group is either murdered
or commits suicide.
Youth Holds Investigation

A detective from Scotland yard,
who happens to be visiting his father,
the local policeman, takes charge of
the case. After questioning everyone
in the house and finding them all to
have perfect alibis, he seems sure
that it was suicide.

But two of the younger members
of the party are not sure whether it
was suicide or murder, and begin an
investigation of their own. What
they discover, how they discover it,
and the difﬁculties they encounter
give the play the interest that has
attracted large audiences both in
England and in this country.

ST. LOUIS ‘ Washington univer~
city's football team will take on G‘ in.
mail Saturday night at Francis field
and, judging from the showing made
by the contending teams against op.
ponents to date, the grid battle should
prove very interesting. If either team
has a slight edge, the Bears ‘appear
to have it on the Pioneers.
Grinnell has played six games this
season and has won three, defeating
Wesleyan, 1970; Carleton, 14 to 18, and
Creighton, 19 to 2. Marquette won
from Gtinnell, e-o. Detroit handed
the Pioneers a terrific Walloping, A7
to 6, and Drake won from the Iowa
boys, 20 to 7.
Grliinell Tackles Good
That last scoreiDrake 20, Grinne‘ll

ington has the ability to put-it over
the Pioneers, and by so doing get in-
to the win column of the Missouri
Valley conference. Friday night
Drake traveled along until the last
quarter of play before the Bulldogs
finally succeeded in running over a
pair of touchdowns, Drake taking
Washington for a victory, 12 to 0.
The GTinnell team has a very good
pair of tackles. Carleton Humphrey,
all~Mlssouri Valley tackle last year,
weighs 175 pounds and is a three-
year man. Lowell Walker plays the
opposite tackle, and was mentioned
for ell-Valley honors last season. He
also weighs 175 pounds. Henry
Thomas, quarterback, is fast and a
clever open-field runner. Thomas
tips the beam at 157 pounds, and is
playing his second year with Grin-
hell.
Work Star-ted Yesterday
strenuous work for Washington
started Tuesday afternoon. More
than likely Sharpe will send his var-
sity through a scrimmage session to
be followed with another Wednesday.
The regulars Monday had things
rather easy. Sharpe taking the boys
off the regular playing field to the
east end of the grid Where he in-
structed the team in some new plays.
With the‘ exception of Wheeler
and Butz, all the regulars were
present. Wheeler reported late at
the field, but appeared to be in good
condition. Butz, it was stated, had
his back slightly injured in the
game Friday against Drake. Blake
was stationed at center for the var-
sity yesterday.
Freshmen Battle Subs
On the regular playing field the
extra hands were engaged in an ex-
citing game against the freshman
team, and the youngsters who are
supposed to be learning college foot-
ball gave the subs just a little more
than had been expected. Joe Getlin,
quarterback on the freshman team,
plunged through the reserve line tor
