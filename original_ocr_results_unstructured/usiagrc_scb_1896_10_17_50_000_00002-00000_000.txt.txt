leNNELL is not so fortunate as
some or her sister institutions in
that a coach for her athletic teams
can be hired for only a portion oi
the season Mr. Blake, atter a
three week stay with us, has left
f ‘Omalia, whence. after a short
I it with college friends, he tvill
return to his home in New York.

Taking all things into considera- ,

tion, his work with the team has
been of a high order; during the
last week, especially, the team has
made rapid strides toward perfeCr
tion. Every effort should be
made to continue this good work.
It is feared there will be atendcn~
cy on the part of the team to ease
up in their practice now that the
coach is gone, But this must not
be permitted, The who
shirlcs his work in the least from
now on to the close of the season,
is not worthy of the ‘.”G Let
every one work to the extreme
limit of his ability, and the reinaine
ing six weeks of the season will
show as brilliant a record as that
