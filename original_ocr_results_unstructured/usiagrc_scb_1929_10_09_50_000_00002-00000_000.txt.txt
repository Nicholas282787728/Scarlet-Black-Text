CHANGES IN SWIMMING PERIODS. .

With the approach of winter, amphibious‘ Grin-
nellians, discouraged in 'tbeir outside ucquatic activi-
ties by the chilly reception accorded them sit-Arbor
Lake, are turning to the swimming pool.

The present schedule which allows college women
to swim on the afternoons of Monday, Wednesday and
Friday, while permitting men to use the pool on the
afternoons of Tues cy, Thursday and part of Saturday,
is obviously a fair one. One would, however, like to
suggest that the pool be open to college men and
women for a short time each\evening as well as in
the afternoon. Under an arrangement of this kind
the schedule might be so adjusted as to allow the wom-

TH‘E GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

en to use the pool on Tuesday and Friday evenings.
This would enable both men and women to have uccess
to the natatorium every day of the week.

Such a class would not have to conflict with any
town organizations using the pool in the evenings as
the period for college swimmers could be set at cither
an earlier or a later hour, than oustide swimming
classes. (This was done in the case of the varsity
swimmers of last year.) Nor would the introduction
of on evening swimming period for collegians neces-
sarily involve more work for the Physical Education
department since the pool could be left in charge of
an experienced student swimmer. There are about
twenty»five senior litersavers among college men and
women, any one of whom could- adequatly protect
those hardy spirits who, of an evening, might care to

brave the. perils of the deep.

THE GRADUATE/S PROBLEM.

Grinnell graduates each spring a group of men
and women. few of whom have any thing but vague
plans of what they will or would like to do, In this
respect it is no different than hundreds of others col-
legesibut this does not excuse us. It is a deplorable
fact that a man or woman entering the status of an
economically independent individual, choosing work
which although it may not be for a life time will cer-
tainly extend over a period of years. should have as
little idea of where to turn as the average college
graduate.

No college student should choose his major willie
out ﬁrst planning what he would like to do after
graduation. While this could not be an infallible rule
it would at least give him some incentive toward
which to work, something ’by which he might arrange
and coordinate his college work. A deﬁnite interest
that would to some degree govern his selection of col-
lege work and to a greater degree his selectoin of
reading material would undoubtedly make college
seem more than going to school so many year's to com-
plete so l-nany required hours.

A college personnel department can and should
play an important part in assisting the student to de—
cide on this interest. It can furnish such information
and literature. so that the student may partly de»
cide for himself if it is really what he desires. The least
this department can do is to show that the profession
range for a college graduate with a liberal arts degree
is not limited to school teaching. With the co-operar
tiun of students themselves the possibilities of such it
department are much broader. Its success would
mean that men and women would graduate from col-
lege not only with definite plans for the future but
conﬁdent that they have chosen in me ﬁeld of their
true interest. At this time of bewilderment there can
be no greater seryice.

makes OLD GOLD gentle to the throatde better to the taste

No one cigarette-maker has any monopoly on
the heat-treatment of cigarette tobaccos.

For heat-treating is neither new nor exclusive.
It has been used for years by practically all
cigarettermakers to “set" and sterilize their
tobacco

But 0 LD co LD' S goodness does not depend on
artiﬁcial treatment. It isrthe product of nat-
urally good tobaccos . . . carefully selected for

mildness, smoothness and ﬂavor. Tobaccos
made free of “throat scratch" by Mother
Nature herself.

Try a package. You’ll immediately get the
thrill of this smoother and better cigarette.
And you'll know then why OLD GOLD‘S sales
are ALREADY THREE TIMES GREATER than the
combined growth of three leading cigarette
brands during a like period of their existence.
