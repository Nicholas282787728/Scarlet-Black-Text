Grillqell’s N. Y.A. Appropriation CalL One- Third

New Fund
ls $8500

Number of Slgdents To
Receive Aid Not An-

nounced

A cut of a least one-third has
been made in the national youth
administration aid for Grinnell
students for this school year,
according to v, D. Patterson. new
student personnel manager,

Last year, Grinnell's appropri-
ation was $12,800 but the de—
crease will bring the amount to
slightly more than $8500. Dry
weather funds, which last year
helped swell the income of stu-
dents from drought areas have
been ommitted from the new
appropriation.

As yet, the number of students
who will benefit by N.Y.A. funds
has not been determined, Accord»
ing to Patterson, each lndividual’s
income will be lowered $10 to $20
a month.

The decrease of onethird is
nation-wide with Iowa’s appro-
priation being slashed from 5592,-
259 to about $432,000, although
the latter rigure has not yet re—
ceived final federal approval.
