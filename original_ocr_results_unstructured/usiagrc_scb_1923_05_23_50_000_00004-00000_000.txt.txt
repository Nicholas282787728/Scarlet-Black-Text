of Grinnell College Persists
In England.

Maxwell Herriott, '20, now attend-
ing Oriel College, Oxford, as aRhodes
Scholar, has written a very interest
ing letter to Prof. Spencer. Ill gives a
stir ing example of the international
reputation of Gl'iuuell, as well as an
insight into student life in the great
English University.
The text of the letter follows:

My dear Professor:

Lust evening an incident took place
which recalled vividly to my mind «in
evening which you and I spent to-
gether. Major lan Hay Beith was the
guest of the American Club and spoke
to us en the subject ”Ourselves Its
‘Others See Us.” After the president
of the Club thanked him, the major
arose and said thot be was delighted
to have been invited and felt
though he "was among friends, espec-
ially as he gazed at the varied army
of college pennants and recognized
such names as Grinnell and Oregon,
