A REAL STEP TOWARDS PEACE

The Pan-American conference now ill
progress in Buenos Aires represents a new
high point in the increasingly cordial rela-
tions between tlle United States and her
sister South American lepublics. Begun
10 years ago under the exceedingly capable
Dwight Morrow, the movement toward good
feeling has progressed steadily with the
withdrawal of the United States from
strictly South American affairs. Secretary
of State Cordell Hull has become of singular
importance in the promotion of the sprit of
good neighborliness.

The consolidation of this good feeling
into a movement toward a regional guaran-
tee of peace is one hopeful sign on the dﬂl'k
horizon of international affairs. The pro
posal to ban the export of war materials of
all sorts to any European powers at wal
should prove to be a powerful deterrent to
armed conflict. Without a doubt, such
measures are useful. But let us hope that

' the statesmen at the conference will not
stop at this point.

It is of the utmost importance to realize
that while national or regional peace and
neutrality are to be sought after with una-
hating energy, the ultimate problem of
world peace must not be overlooked. Al-
though measures do not necessarily remove
the causes of war. It is to be hoped that
the conference will not lead to ostrich-like
regional isolation, but toward a powerful
nucleus of peace, understanding, and ecoll»
omic justice which may soon be strong
enough to exercise positive leadership in
removing the causes of European conflict,

A CHANCE FOR STUDENT TALENT

For some time the Tanager has been
seeking to encourage creative writing on the
Grinnell campus; for the staff has felt that
a larger percentage 01' the material printed
in the Tanager should be contributed by
Grinnell students. In the past the mug
zine has contained material written by off-
the-campus writers simply because there
has been no interest manifested on the cam-
pus in submitting articles for publication.

In the hope of calling forth some Grin»
nell talent, the Tanager board is sponsoring
the first annual writing contest; the board
will welcome material of various kindsi

humor, essays, poems, and short stol'iesi
and the prize \l ill be $5 to the hall and $5
to the cottage which has the most material
accepted for publication.

This contest offers an opportunity for
those who me really interested ill writing
to set- their work published. Also this w' l
help keep the Tanager an essentially Gl n-
nell publication. Some of the results of this
contest may be seen in the last issue of the
Tanager, in an essay by a freshman. Sui -
ly uppel'clnssmen are not going to allow
themselves to be shown up by the ambitions
freshmen! 7A.L.B.

SECRET TREATIES

The charge that Germany and Italy are
bound by a secret military alliance was made
by the Russian foreign minister, Maxim
Litvilloff. before the all-union congress of
Soviets now in session ill Moscow, is alarm»
illg. Tile secret pact, Litvinoll' said, was
aimed directly tit Russia and Colllnlullislll,
and, since the pact, two border clashes al-
ready have taken place in the Far East.

This alliance seems to be but one of a
number of alignments taking place ill the
world today which is lining up Fascist lla-
tions on one side and Communist and SociaL
ist nations on the other. There are treaties
between Italy and Germany and between
Japan and Gel-molly as we have seen. Lit-
villoff charged that Italy had proposed to
Japan that she and that country enter into
a similar alliance.

With such alliances being formed; with
such great military preparations by all na-
tions; with such a great increase in the
Russian naval forces since 1933, the danger
of a fight for survival between Communism
and Fascism is growing. And in addition
the dangers of a world conflict grows.

Other Opinions

WRITE IT UP

College newspapers are curious things; they
find expression in extremes. Some are radical,
Some are cautious and conservative. Mucb depends
upon the persons involved.

These newspapers are manned by men flesh in
the newspaper game, they are enthusiastic and
filcrt. Thorr stories should have punch and sparkle,
freshness and the spontaneous quality common to
youthful writing. Often the copy lacks polish. It
may be lacking in unity and case of flow, Likc the.
wl'ltel , tmay move too quickly to conclusions.
Front page stuff, straight news material, may be
tinged, hero and iberc with an editorial color.

0n college staffs arc men so green that they
don’t know an invertcd pyramid story from a sick
Camel? Yet these men learn quickly and su'lve to
unite in the best traditions of newspaper practice.

On the editorial staff are aspiring journalists.
Many of them think they can improve upon the
work of tnc metropolitan shcets. They write lusty
cdrtorisis, 0r subtle editorials, or conservative talk
tor-raiseas the occasion demands. Some of these
men find ouLleL only in vicious attacks upon the fac-
ulty. Others believe that it rs well to court the
favor of those higher up and submerge their own
personalities to the will of faculty dictation of the
paper.

Extremes in either direction prove disastrous
ior both the paper and those working on it This
is the formulativc period for many of tomorrow’s
successes and flops in the journalism field. It is thc
proving ground for Writing experiments and mental
gymnastics—Michigan State News.

The latest known method of cheating is that of
writing crib notes on glasses of watch dials, using
grape juice as the invisible ink. Like most of the
other methods, it works until the prof catches on.

We hope this suggestion isn't taken too Serious-

Grinnell Family rCoat-of-Arms
Found in Library Basement

The Grinncll family coat-afﬁrms
has been lying buried for eight
months in a trunk rn the basement
of the college library, and no one
know it until a week ago Elliot
Glinncll Mears, grandson of J. B.
Gr-rnnell, had wrltten to Miss Anne
Elizabeth SmlLll, tlircctor of the
quadrangle and dormitories, that
he would present the crest to
Meal's cottage if he could find it
among Lhc belongings of his mour
or, the late Mar-y Grillnell Meals.
A news tip to e Scarlet and
Black reporter led to the unearth-
ing of the crest from the trunk,
after following a trail through
practically every executive office
on the campus. Also in the trunk
were several family pictures, his-
tor al documents, and a dark red
Oriental rug which had been prom-
ised to the pl‘eSldcllt's office.
Tire crest is painted in colors,
and framed in silver. IL is about
10 inches wide and 12 inches high
At the top is a broad stripe of
brilliant red with a lion rampant
upon it, Below the red is a strip

of vlvid blue.

A broad, inverted v of silver
ehtellds upward from the bottom
of the crest, and under the v is a
reddish-brown pomegranate. No
onc socms to know exactly what
the clcst means,

other gifts presented to the
quadrangle by the Mcars family
have been two grandfather clocks,
several pictures, a large, rust-
coolrcd rug, and the grand piano
in the quadrangle drawingrroom.

Slnce Mrs, Mears’ death last
September, her son has been dis-
mulltlirlg her “Orchard Home" in
Essex, Mass. several of the gifts
now in the college had been in the
family home for years.

Dr. Elliot Grinnell Mears is pro-
fessor of international trade at
Stanford university. He is the su~
Ll‘lor of several books on corn—
morcc, and on conditions in Greese
and To by He is also drrector of
the Hoover War library, and per-
mancnt secretary of the pan-Paci-
fic Commercial conference.
