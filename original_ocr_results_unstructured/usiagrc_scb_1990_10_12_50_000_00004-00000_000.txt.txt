Medieval
Revivalists
Host Big
Gathering

By Diane Brumley

The Society for Creative
Anachronlsms (SCA) is hosting a
kingdomrwtde event, the Royal
University of Scir Hafok
(R.U.S.H.), Saturday, The SCA
“kingdom" of which Grinnell is a
part covers Iowa, Missouri and
neighboring parts of Nebraska,
Kansas and Arkansas.

A R.U.S.H. event takes place
twice a year in each kingdom, and
is a daylong activity offering
classes (most to be taught by
Grinnell graduates) in medieval
dancing, cooking, history and war.
The events begin at 9 arm. and
conclude in the evening with a
medieval feast and a bonfire near
the observatory. The slogan for the
day is “eat, drink and be learned.”

“It should be a really good, re-
ally interesting event," said Nicole
Page. John Danos, the SCA mem-
bcrinchargeoforganizingR.U.S.H.
at Grinnell, estimated that about
150 members from other states will
show up.

“It‘s Lruly an honor that the
College of No Mountain (Grinnell)
is allowed to have this event,“ said
sophomore Erik Brandenburg
(aka. Derek Brianon of Dungrove).
He explained that one festival is
held in the northern pan of the

Jdngdom, and the second in the
southem pan of the kingdom each
year. Last year, Grinnell put in a
bid to be the northern host, but lost
out to Iowa Stale.

Explaining the foreignness of
such names as “Scir Hafok", and
“No Mountain," Page said that the
gist of SCA is to pick a character
who might have lived between 600
and 1600, and to imitate what their
way of life may have been. Places
in the United States are also re
divided and re-named.

“It's almost like you're being
somebody else that day," added
Page, whoseSCA petsona is named
Mirrim Christine. SCA meets once
a week on Sunday, at 8:30 p.m. in
various locations.

Although theday'sactivitiesare
being hosted by and forSCA mem
bers, Danos added “If someone
wants to come join us to ﬁnd out
whatSCA is about, that's line. It‘s
morethanjustaparty for us. It's an
educational experience.”

Review Boosted by New Class

 

By Susan Roth

“There are a lot of good
writers on this campus right
now, and we should take ad
vantage of that" said Grinnell
Review Editor Glen Brown.
With Lhatin mind, he and the
reStoftheRevt'ewstaff, under
the supervision of Faculty/
Staff Adviser Jennifer
Grinnell are gearing up for

of several years.

“Basically I want to see
more of everything submit
ted,"said Brown. “The more
we have to choose from, the
wider variety we have and
the better the Crime]! Re-
view is."

Brown is especially en-
couraging the submission of
academic essays, which has
greatly declined in the last

 

 

the possibility of doing two
issues per year starting Fall 19914

Already the Grinnell Review has
been publicizing campus literary
talent in co-sponsoring a reading
with the Grinnell Forensics League,
featuring the winners of the Enr
glish Department poetry and fic-
tion contests.

Brown attributes the increase in
creative writing to more and better
outlets for it. For the ﬁrst time, the
college is offering Creative Writ-
ing as a class below the 300 level.
In addition, the student-run Writ-
crs’ interest Group, which began
last year, continues to provide a

forum for creative writing.

“Students are going to write more
and a lot of what they are going to
write Will be very good,” said
Brown.

The 1991 Crime” Review will
be Volume 10. since the publica-
tion restarted in 1983 after a break

couple of years. Overall, he
hopes to see things that are well
written in the sense that they ideas

Convocation Lecturer Talks of
Necessity for Student Activism

By Sharyn Obsatz

Students “bother the world" by
raising questions about the issues
of peace and war, civil rights and
student rights, according to Lee
Knefelkamp last Thursday in her
Convocation speech ”Weapons of
the Spirit: Towards a New Genr
eration of Student Activists."

Knefelkamp. Professorof higher
education at Columbia and a senior
associate of the American Associa
tion of Higher Eduation, believes
this generation of college students
will expand the deﬁnition of activ»
ism and what it means to care and
be a community.

“We are on the cusp of a new
generation of student activists.
activists who are necessary to the
world‘s future," said Knefelkamp,
emphasizing the great extent to
which students have the power to
effect change.

“Sutdents have morepowerthan
they sometimes thinkthey do. You
can change historyt..in your com-
munity, in your own life, in your
world” She stressed that she was
not talking about instant, over-
whelming global change, but
gradual, incremental change which
happens slowly over many years.

Some students on campus are
skeptical of the extent to which the
actionsofGrinnellCollegestudents
affect international, naLional, local
issues and even issues relating

“We‘re 1200 people in the
middle oflowa among 250 million
people in the United States," said
Barry Matchett, “Nothing that
Grinnell College does makes that
much difference on a large-scale
basis. Rather,
Grinnell College
should focus on
keeping the stu-
dents informed

we can become
active citizens. I

hope for us being

Caleb Rush
disagreed.

“As college
students, we are amazingly impor-
tant to society.” he said.

“We are the educated youth. If
we do something, people will pay
attention. Each of us has the power
of the human voice. It’s mistaken
to think that power comes from
achieving some post after we
graduate. We should take posses-
sion of our power and use iL"

Shelly West pointed out the
power in most student group lies in
“heightening the awareness of
people on campus so that they can
go out and tell other people about
an issue." This awareness. claimed

West, inﬂuences how we react to
the world outside Grinnell.

“Any student has the ability to
have power; that power comes
through raising the awareness of
peopleand getting them angry. It's
the way to get them going,“ said
West.

Disagreement
alsoexistedon the
deﬁnition of an
activist

Knefelkamp
defined it as
“ﬁnding a way to
act on your
knowledge in the
world." She in-
cluded in her
deﬁnition of ac-
tivism such acr
tivitiesasactively
participating in
class, engaging in the planning of
curriculum and writing letters to
the campusnewspaper. She suessed
that “activism isn’t just social or
political, It’s found in the daily
work of the butcher, the baker and
the candlestick-maker. notjust the
poliLician or social worker."

Rush countered that “the need
for activism calls for something
more than ‘just participation in
class."

Knefelkamp reasoned that
peopleneod to getinvolved in some
kind of activism because every
problem or injustice in society be~

“Thinking that something doesn't

“The restrictions of society are on
everybody, Being aware of the
mistreaunent of a cenain group
makes one aware of one’s own re-
striations,"

Knefelkamp also said that re-
gardless of whether one is affected
by an injustice, “oncshould always
care for the stranger and never co-
operate With evil." She added,
“Apathy allows evil to exist"

“If something isn’t right, we
should work to right it, regardless
of whether it affects us directly."

Activists do not always step for-
ward at Grinnell.

“Here in Grinnell, We don't al-
ways see the big scheme of things,"
said West. "We are isolated, and
there are constant demands being
made on our time and energy.”

Clay Patty felt that he would
become involved if there was an
issue he really cared about very
strongly, but Lhalhe hasn’t found
one yet.

“People really have to be drawn
to something or else they aren‘t
committed," said Knefelkampt
“Yet, they need some knowledge
about the issues before they’re in—
terested. Students can't just sit in
their dorm rooms and wait for that
knowledge to come to them. They
have to pursue it Never settle for
knowing less than you believe you
can know.”

education and increasing their
