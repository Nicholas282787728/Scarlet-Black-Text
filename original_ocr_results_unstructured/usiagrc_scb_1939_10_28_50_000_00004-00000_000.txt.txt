Dibble liall continued its winnin .

and scoring ways last Wednes-
day when it donned a stubborn.
Langan eight. 20 to o. in the
opening game of the second
round of the intramural touch
football league. In another con-
test. Wednesday. Gates defeated
Clar 6 to 0.

Jerry Fort again paced his
mates by his spectacular triple
threat playing. Fort was the in-
stigator of all the Dibble scoring.
His bullet-like passes hit the
target for repeated gains. Lang,”
an. however. held the Fort scar»
ing machine to only six points in
the first half. Largely as the re»
sult of insufficient reserve power.
the Langah team weakened in the
second half. and Dibble forced
across two more touchdowns.

On Ward field the Gates eight
encountered a battered Clark
squad. Clark vainly tried to for—
get its 46 to o defeat at the
hands of Dihble Tuesday after»
