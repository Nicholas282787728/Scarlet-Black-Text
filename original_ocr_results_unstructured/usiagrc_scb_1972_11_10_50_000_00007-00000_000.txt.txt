speaking Dutch exclusively at home

tion must be expressed quickly and
succinctly, Dutch is the prevalent

her parents were relativelyconsev

allowed for a rich social life which
oilen included neighboring iarm

heting by girls and boys alike and
producing all oi their own clothes
and toys. in the winter when show
made school attendance impossible,
the family was keptbusybuichering,
canning, and making soap andpaste.

Both Van Sants ended theirschool-
ing prior to the high school level.
What schooling they had, took place
in a onerroom schoolhouse. Re-
ligious indoctrination >followed a
very Dutch pattern with the Reiorm
Faith. Today, the Van Sants still
attend the First Reformed Church
in Sully and their pastor, Wayne
Tripp, is a frequent visitor to the
store.

During their childhood, tarming
was simply organic, Untortunately,
Mrs. Van Sant points out, many of
her generation were “brainwashed
by the agri-business”. Largechem-
ical companies such as DX. Gulf
and Standard made large grants to
institutions like Iowa State and the
results were unmistakealile. Soon,
farmers believed chemicals could

replace crop rotation and natural
fertilizers, and could reduce costs
and time.

Like many other rarmers, the Van
Shuts realized that the useoichemr
icals was unhealthy, unecononiical
and destructive to theworldriairlous
topsml oi lowa The message was
Clear: “Get back to family farm-
ing” and avoid the carelessnessand
impersonality of “big business”.
By 1965 the VanSalIts apenedasmali
store on their term in hopes or
”providing a service ior better
food”, .

Their products were so success—
iul that they were awarded a trip
to Hawaii and Europe tor leading
lows in sales oi organic produce.

in April oi this year, theyoccupied
the defunct East End Grocery and
stacked it with foods, vitamins, an-
thues and furniture. it is their be-
lief that as the number or organic
farmers increase, [hell freight
costs will decrease and prices will
rival commercial stores. One
senses that their loudest dream is
that their eryedrrold son will cons
