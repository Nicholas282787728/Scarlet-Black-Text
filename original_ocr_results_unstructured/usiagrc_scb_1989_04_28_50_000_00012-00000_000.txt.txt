Softball team one
victory shy of record

by Laura Whitmore

Grinnell softball had a rough
week but managed to cap it off
with a happy ending

On Saturday, the team
traveled to Illinois College for a
doubleheader. Both games were
very close, with the second going
10 innings. Illinois College
managed to just squeak past
Grinnell in both contests, 64 and
776.

Monday the Pioneers hosted
Monmouth, making up the
doubleheader which was rained
out earlier. Once again, Grinnell
played tough, keeping the scores
close both games. They lost the
first game 64. but pushed the
second game to extra innings
After 11 innings, Monmouth
scored to go up 10-9, and held on
for the win

The happy ending came on
Wednesday, when Grinnell hosted
non-conference foe Clarke
College for their final home
games this season. It appeared as
thought the game was headed into
extra innings, as it remained
scoreless through six and a half.

In their half of the seventh.
however, the Pioneers got things
rolling. After Pam Freese

putting Grinnell in scoring

With one out, Neva Specht

lightning storm which canceled
the second half of the
doubleheader.

Coach Gilbert was once again
pleased with his team‘s perfor-
mance, saying, “Success is a
measure of where you begin and
how far you advance We’ve
done extremely well.”

Grinnell now has an 878
record, tying the record for most
games won by any Pioneer
softball team. Gilbert feels they
have a decent chance of winning
one or two from Knox in their
last doubleheader tomorrow, to
become the winningcst Grinnell
softball team ever. “I‘m
counting on the seniors for the
last games to carry us through,"
he said. Playing their final
games in a Grinnell uniform,
they‘ll probably do just that.

Pioneers shutout '
Rams with pitching
and solid defense

by Bob Liftoti

A win is a win. When you‘re
below .500 and hanging on for
dear life for a playoff position,
you'll take a Victory any way you
can get it. There doesn‘t have to
be anything fancy about it.

Tuesday’s game against
Cornell proved that a team can
indeed come away victorious
without any offense. The
Pioneers only managed two hits
all afternoon, both by Marty
Hunsuckcr, but still shut out the
Rams 1-0. The secret? Quality
pitching and solid (intense.

Senior righthandcr Dave
Steinman turned in another
superlative perforatnncc on the
mound. Calm and composed,
Steinman pitched his way out of
several jams en route to five
innings of shutout ball,

Relief came in the form of
senior Jim Wciand, recently back
after suffering a broken nose. In
two innings, Weiand blew
fastballs by the Ram batters,
striking out four. He and
Steinman combined for a four
hitter.

The other essential ingredient
in this road win was stellar
defense. The Pioneers, who on
occasion have been known to
forget their gloves in the locker
room, executed well in the field.
committing only one error on the
day.

Comell pitching wasn’t too
shabby, either. The sad thing for

the Rams’ coach to grapple with
is the fact that his pitcher threw a
two-hitter and they stll lost.
Baseball can bc a funny game.
The lone Pioneer run, which

didn't surface until the fifth
inning, wasn’t your textbook
score, thereby flowing nicely
with the day's outing on a whole.
Senior Eric Dahlin had the
dubious honor of striking out but
reaching fusion 2 throwing error
from the less-than-qualil'led Rams
Catchert

After stealing second, Dahlin
scored on Hunsucker‘s second hit
of the afternoonﬁa single, of
course. But like I said,
victories don‘t grow on trees: you
can’t be picky.

Twenty-two year reign as swim -
mascot over: bye, bye, Buddha

by David Ressner

For the past 22 years, the
Buddha has been the mascot of
the men‘s swim team. He has
led the men to 15 conference
championships, including 12 of
the last 14; numerous All-
American honors; and even a few
individual national
championships.

According to Coach Ray
Obermiller. the tradition began in
1968 at a conference meet. The
regular season had been a
nightmare, the only losing
season (247) in Obermiller's 23
years at Grinnell.

At confcrcncc, Grinnell was
being badly beaten in virtually
every event, when finally one of
the swimmers. Jim Williams
from Ottiimwa, brought out a

statuette of Buddha. The team
rallied around the figure, with
each swimmer rubbing in bellyl
Although they did not win, the
team did preserve its sclfrrespect
by turning in a number of good
performances,

“It helped us to swim well,”
claimed Obermillcr. “We
attributed it to Buddha,“

Over the next few years.
Buddha grew in popularity,
eventually becoming a member
of the team and a fixture on
campus. One year after Buddha‘s
inception (1959), lllc men‘s team
won almost all of their meets and
placed third in confcrcnce. In
1970, the guys won conference.
Pretty amazing turnaround for a
team that just two years before

had lost seven of their nine g
meets.

This season, however, a
controversy erupted over the stat- ,
uette. Following the conference
championship meet in which ‘
Grinnell set a new scoring record .
(729 points), a group of students
approached Obermiller to voice -
thcir displeasure with the team’s A
useofBuddha

Senior Joe Lewis expressed '
the feelings of most of his fellow ‘
swimmers by saying, “It was
never our intention to offend'
anyone." Another swimmer y
wanted “to change the mascot
both to demonstrate the team’s '
willingness to be reasonable and ‘
our sincerity in not wanting to
hurt anyone.” The coach -
consented as well: “I think '
dropping Buddha is the right
