Dear Grinnell Community,

Besides the publications that
SPARC pays for, there are at least
two more publications that were not
mentioned [in Eric Olsen’s article in
the February 25 issue of the 5&8].

The first is THE SHIT, a weekly
comics page with a zero rejection
policy. It may be a bit hard to find,
since there are only around 60 cop-
ies primed per week.

The second is a newer publica-
tion entitled IN THE KNOW, con
sisting of art, writing, and submis-
sions.

It’simponantforpeople to know
about these resources so that the
image of media at Grinnell doesn‘t
revolve around “submit/edil/reject/
publish“. There's some indepen»
dent material being put out that re
volves around communication, less
on standards.

I would like to let you know, that
as Editor-In-Chief of the
Scarlet &Black, I take letters to the
editor quite seriously. I believe that
lenerstothceditorgiveyouahereadcr,
achanceiomeakyourmindtothe
Grinnell Community as a whole.

So, when I received the letter
from “SeveralResideanf MainHall"
on Tuesday, March I, I took it senr
ously and printed it iii the paper.

anwhile, over the course of
the week from when the leuer was
received and printed Friday, it was
broughtto my aucutton that the rnatmr
between thest team and Main had
been more or less been resolved and
that printing the letter would do more
harm than good.

This is where IltcStfiB's limita-
tions come in. Were the 5&3 a daily
paper instead of weekly, we could
more accurately deal with the rate at
which issues develop on campus,

I was asked by another party to
remove the letter from last week's
issue, but that would have been sen»
sorship. The leuer an'ived before the
deadline (noononTuesdays) and was
therefore printed, lﬁrmly believe ln
the freedom of speech.

To the Editor:

I would like to address last
week‘s letter to the editor from
”Several Residents of Main
Hall.” They were understand-
ably unhappy with the swim

team's performance in their

dorm. We were out of line. Per
riod. And we h' e apologized.
accepted responsibility for the damn
ages, and taken steps to ensure that
our mistakes are not repeated.

The letter stated that its purpose

to “perform a valuable 5ch
vic Alf) warn future dorm resi-
dents to keep the swim team out of
their lounges. Fine. But somehow
this purpose was lost amid a lot of
talk about how much the swim team
“sucks." To condemn our actions is
legitimate; to condemn us is not. By
the samercasoning employed toconr
clude that “very few residents of
Mainhaveanyrespectlcftforfswim-
mers] at all," I can conclude that
Main Hall is uptight and overrcact-
lng. Neither generalization is accu-
rate, fair, or representative of the
people involved.

Parties happen, things get bro-
ken, and toes get stepped on. I am
not excusrngourbehavior, butlwill
say that swimmers do not suck and
thatlamproudtobeamemberoflhe
team. In the future, “Several Resi-
dents," focus on thedeeds and noton
the personalities of the doers. Even
the most irrefutable argument is
weakened when it becomes personal.

Dear Editor,

This letter is inresponse to alettcr
published in lastweck‘sSdtB concem-
ing the swnn team‘s end of the year
party. The purpose of this letter is to
address the accusations found in the
aforementioned letter.

The letter, signed “Sevcml Resi»
dens of Main Hall," was very un fairto
the Swrm team. Nowhere in die letter
was it mentioned that ﬁnancial rcr
sponsibtlity was taken by the swim
team forall Ihcdumages incurred withr
outbcing approached by Main Hall or
StudentAffairs. Three separate groups
of swtmmcrs cleaned up Gardener Ll'iC
followmg momrng, each group inop-
ping, vacuuming and generally trying
to maketheplacclook niccrdian ltwas
prior to the party. Funhcrinore, rcprcr
sentattvcs of theswtm tcttm attended a
Main Hall Council meeting the Tues-
day following the party to apologwc
forthc actions ofindtviduals who may
have invaded thcpn'vacy ofMuin Hall
residents, and to discuss the accusar
tiortsmadein dielettcr. In thatmeeling
itbecameevidcntthaiihe problem was
notthedamagesincurred,buttheinvar
sion of personal space that the resi-
dents ofMain Hall fell occurred. This
issue was not at all addressed in the
letterlhat was published in lastwcek’s
5&3. We discussed this issue ofinva-
sion of privacy with the Hall Council
in an attempt to curb this problem at
future parties. I Lhiru< it )5 fair to say
that both parties came away from that
meeting feeling that it was a positive
and productive encounter.

We were disappointed with the
5&8'5 decision to publish the letter
considering the number of concerns
regarding the content of the letter, not
just by members of the swim team but
by a substantial number of Main Hall
residents, many of whom asked to
have their name removed from the
letter after we met with the HallCounr
cil. We feel that to publish a letter that

Come ea? err
PfW’I; Mr (and
Of this world,

contains such controversial accusa-
tions without first investigating the
nature of those accusations is unfair to
theaccused andtothose who expressed
concern withthclctter. It is also unfair
to the members of Main Hall, implyv
ing that a large number of Main resi-
dents wanted their name attached to
the letter when in reality it wasa small
fraction of the residents of Main,

We regretthatsuch actionsnwded
to be taken but again apologize to the
residents of Main Hall for invading
Lhetrprivacy, and feel that last week's
letter in the 5&8 was an unfair (leIC-
non of the party.

Sincerely,

The Men and Women’s
Swrmming and Divtng Team,
and the Main Hall Council

dear Grinnell community,

hi. how you doing. My name is
michael. I like to ride bikes, play
music, write poetry, and sometimes
l swnn. can i be your friend? inced
new friends, cause the ones i got
now always break things and act
irresponsible. Sure they are nice,
and generous, and caring, and work
hard, and nice, and talented and all.
But when ever they have fun they
are soooooo crazy; you wouldn't
believe it! i like them a lot, but my
mom says i can't play with them
anymore. My mom says they suck.
so can i play with you? iknow this
one game called “scapegoat“ or an-
other called “i am angry, what are
you? (an SandB)" come and play,
come and play (freedom).

asking what's the point
(when it’s missed),
