forever and the great. beauty is God."
"No one creates beauty, he simply ex-
presses it, and the most beautiiul e-
pression is a noble soul, so God is
the supreme beauty." This is a re—
cent expression of the idea but has
the same meaning as that of the,
Greeks, rythAgoras, in Magda Gl'ae-‘
cia, organized a secret order, whose
members spent two years in "think~
ing oi truth and beauty.” From this
group came the idea or number, then
proportion, both at these ideas being
related to planets, which had never
mun together. “There was no discord,
so the idea or harmony developed."
This harmony was soon expressedl
as the “music at the spheres”, and be—
cause there is harmony in the soul we
can not hear this greater
except at times.

came to pantheism. Next they have
