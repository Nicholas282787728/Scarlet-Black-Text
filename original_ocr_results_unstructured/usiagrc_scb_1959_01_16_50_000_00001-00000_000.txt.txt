His topic is “From Knowledge

There will be no service held

in Herrick chapel on Feb. 1,
due to the semester break.
Robert A. Dentlel‘, research

cago, will speak at 9 am. Wed—
nesday in Herrick chapcl on

American Friends Internes in
Community Service Projects.
which is a Quaker serviceprm
gram.

This will be the final Wed-
nesday Chapel service of this
semester.

During the next week there
will be brief (five to lo minutes)
daily periods of prayer, meditaa
tion and scripture reading in
the choir stalls oi Herrick chap-
el. The services, beginning at
l p.m., will treat the problem
of how and why to unite the
various Christian churches.

According to Wueller, who
wiil lead these meetings, udivid-
ed Christianity is a perfect ob-
ject for studies in prejudice,
bigotry, intolerance and haught-
iness. The worldwide. ecumen—
ical desire for a united Chris-
tianity, with all its psychological
sociological, cultural and politic
col implications, quite apart from
its religious value, is the perfect
object of studies in the basis of

a new world order.”

On Enlerr‘l-ainlers

Considcrahlc debatc concern-
ing discontent of many students
about the Kingston Trio concert,
now deﬁnitely scheduled tor
March 17, took place at Student
Council‘s Wednesday night meet-

made by the council.

According to the Council’s

recommendation, this poll,would

types of concerts wanted by the
students. When choosing the
concert, the council would use
this as a basis for consideration.
laciorc a specific group
is contracted, consensus of the
poll will be published, in are
dcr to clear up any possible
misunderstanding and misin-
formation existing between
the student body and the
council.

The club, which will feature buffet service, student
enteltttinment, and il small dance floor with hi-fl music,
will be run by a student manager to be appointed by Mer-

precedent for support to the
Honor ”G"-sponsored Homecom-
ing dance and other organiza-
tional functions.

Although denying ﬁnancial
support, the committee declared
itself in favor of having a Mili-
tary Ball and onered technical
and moral support.

in other action, the following
recommendations were sent to
the Student Council:

1. That the Social Coordinat-
ing committee assume respon—
sibility ﬁnancially and socially
tor the oa-campus program.

2. That allocation or admin.
istrative funds to the o oi HP
and AWS Board be assumed
by the student council.

3. That the Gadaliouts not
receive any so subsidy lor the
Christmas tonnal.

These recommendations were
made to enable the committee
to devote its funds to social
uses exclusively, while operate
ing expenses of the c of HP
and Aws Board would be tak-
en care of through council’s

budget.

located in the private dining mom.

A theme for the Club will be
selected by the planning com-
mittee. Under consideration so
tar are a theater theme, with
posters of Broadway shows for
decorations, and an abstract
theme, using modern art posters.

Since the club will accom-
modate only 40 couples, res~
ervations will bc necessary.
The cover charge for each
couple will include admission,
food and entertainment; bev-
erages will be extra. Required
dress will be coats and ties
for men, heels and hose for
women.

The student manager, with
tho title Maitrc d', will be a
sophomore or junior, employed
for a minimum or 15 hours a
week. He will be in charge of
reservations, food and entertain-
ment. Two waiters will also be
employed. Applications for these
positions will be opened at a

later date.

College funds are being used
to start the club. If the club is
successful, more furnishings and
decorations will be added. mir-
niture ordered so far includes
12 tables for two; these are of
the pedestal type and are dor-
mica-topped. In addition, 14
tables for tour will the obtained
from the college.

Chairs will he of modem de-
sign, the same type as those
ordered ior the new library.
Candles and trusted candle-
holdcrs will be placed on each
table, and the committee ham

Stalled,

it is hoped that the supper
club will provide “an attractive,
quiet and sophisticated place
where couples can go after a
show, concert or game," Ludwig
said.
