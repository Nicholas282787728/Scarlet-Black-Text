2 as Nick, and Nancy Keatiiig as

Kitty Duvnll are shown in a scene from \Villizlm Sili‘oynn’s “The

, Time oi Your Life."

The play Will be presented tonight at 1:45 and tomorrow

night at 3:30 in Aim auditorium
by Jane Baghy

“The Time oi Your Life" pre-
sented by George ”Goughnoui‘i
and Rowland K. Chase in ARH‘
auditorium last night sucessiully
developed into ’a tragic chal‘acs
terization of the human paradox.

Tonight the show begins at!
7:45, and curtain time tomorrowI
is 0:30 p. in,

in a skillfully . manipulated
mood play, using the introduc-
ition of contrasting personalities
(there are 22 characters in the
play)‘ from both sides oi the‘
tracks, the author, William
Saroyan, showed the discomiol'ir
ing percep ‘on oi human weak-
nesses. ,

In the tirst three acts oi the
play Norm Noe had a chance
to warm up and became in the
iourth act the outstanding ac—‘
tor of the play. Jim Ploss, Jim
Leavenworth, Hull Fothoven,
John Leetz, and'Bob Vas Dias
competently supported him, dis-
playing versatility within their
characterizations. ,

A floozy Kitty Du‘val was

portrayed by Nancy ,Keating who _i

showed her dramatic ability by
the development oi this charac-
ter into an uncertain Katherina
Koranovsky. Wallace Whipple,
Evi Grottewit, David Dickson,
Jo Anne Tam. and Patty Mai»
i shall, representing the inherent
irailties of a secure position
in high society, gave a needed
liit to the obvious remoteness
of a ha-room scene to a Grins
nell audience. _
Humor. other than individual

ticularly significant—those oi the
newsboy, played by Ben Jones,
a bright happy iad; and the
drunkard, played by Chase, a
bright, happy drunk. Chase car»
ried on in the place of Norm
Coh‘en, doing a this Job.

A bunch of crazy people in a
crazy world became much too
real’ last night to leave a very
comfortable feeling with the
audience. The introduction ol
current events into the dialogue
only served to make‘a depressing
evening moi-c depressing for
some of us.
