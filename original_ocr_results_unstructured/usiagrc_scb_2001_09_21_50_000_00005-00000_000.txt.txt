For some students, the journey to Grinnell
began thousands of miles and another
culture away. We asked international
students and admissions staff to discuss
how students from five different continents
find their way here.

When Uiriair Javed '04. went online to look at the best colleges
rankings released by the us. Neurerrrunzrr-u/irprrrnvo years ago, he
never would have imagined it would eventually take hint from Paki-
stan to the small town of Grinncll, Iowa, on the other side of the
globe.

Although the Internet has become a molar resource for Internac
tional students to conduct research on American colleges, rircre are
also other ways international stttdents find out abotit Grinncll. "Most
of them look at the US News rankings; some receive information
about Grinnell from their high school counselors; many know of
Gtinnell by word of m0uth»us\lall)‘ alumni aitd their families and
friends," said Eric Staah, Associate Dean ofAdntissloit and Coordiititv
tor of International Admission.

Students from other countries often begin their research with in-
formation obtained from their loci] USIS (United States information
Servrcesi offices. in fner, one ofthc reasons Grinneli guts astonishing
numbers ofapplications from countries like Bulgaria year after year is
because ofthe USIS office there, iit addition to the admissions reel urtc
ment effort.

"The Admissions Ofﬁce is committed to actively recruiting inter-
national students and a mayor part of the activities here is what we
called prooerrve reCruirlitg travelling to different countries to sprerd
the word about Gi'iitnell," explained Staab In fact, Staab is currently
on a nvurweck recruitment trip In Asia "But Grinncll‘s recruitment
ehforr does nor single out any speciﬁc region. Recruitment trips to
Africa ere made every other yesr, usually lasting two and a lnlfiveelrs,
andJnit Sumner, Dean ofAdmission and Financial Aid, will spend

Partly as a reiulr otrirroc efforts. Grinneil consistently rank: high
among national liberal arts colleges in percenruge oflnternatlonal stu-
dents in the student body. Janet Alexander, Director oflnternational
Student Service, says that the College has seen quite a remarkable
increase in the numbers of international students, ”from last year's
7.9% to this year‘s 9.8% ofthc total student body. We currently have
139 students from 46 countries," she enthusiastically remarked.

That number also puts Grinnell well ahead of many ofits peer
institutions, such as Williams, Stvarthmcirc, and Oberlin, in the per-

How di'dyouﬁnd out about Grinnell?
My educational counselors in Bombay
suggested I go to Grinnell. I received
more information about Grinnell from
the college website, the Scarlet and
Black and the opinions other people
had about Grinnell.

What were your ﬁrst impressions upon
am'vi'ng in Grinnell?
The students I meton arrivalwere not

as I expected. They were in many
words crazy, weird, unique and difr
ferent, I was really overwhelmed the
first semester with all the people.
classes and choices of clubs and or
ganizations. t was disappointed when
I ﬁgured out i didn’t have enough
time to be in everything.

What surpn'sed you the most about
Gn'nnell?

, india
The social life was different. I thought
there would be little or no social life
here. However, I now enjoy the social
life and feel it is an important part of
the Grinnell experience. I also believed
for quite a while that all of America
was like Gn'nnell, However, as I ven-
tured out into the rest of the United
States, I realized this wasn't true. It's
not America, just Grinnell.

How did you ﬁnd out about En‘nnell?
I read a book about becoming an
American student, written by a Pol-
ish student who went to school in
America. In this book, he examined
the best liberal arts colleges for in—
ternational students. Grinnell was on
the top of the list according to many
factors including percentage ofinterc
national students on campus as well
as ﬁnancial aid and the social life of
the college.

What were you/ﬁrst impressions upon
arriving in Grinnell?

The buildings were impressive. How»
ever, I was mostly in shock over the
size of the town. This worried me for
a while, but the college is in a differ-
ent world than the town. Also, inter-

national admissions were extremely
friendly. When I had new student ori-
entation for international students, it
was built around how Americans think
and how to react to different Situas
(ions and behaviors, This helped my
transition incredibly, I wouldn't have
been able to make any kind of transi~
Lion without the help of the orienta-
tion.

What surprised you the most about
Gﬁnnell?

I was mostly surprised at the facili-
ties at Grinnell. The theater and tin»
ema impressed me for the school’s
size. Also, students are friendly here
and this school is more liberal than I
expected. .

 

How did you find out about Gn'nriell?
I went to a high school which em-
ployed American English teachers.
They helped me quite a bit by using
the internet and looking for schools
thatoffered programs forinternational
students. I didn’t have the internet
and so my instructors looked for
schools that offered international stu-
dents fullscholatships. Ialso had con-
tact with people from Grinnell inter-
national admissions and the Interna»
tional Student Organization.

What were your ﬁrst impressions upon
arriving in Erinnell?

the culture was the first thing i no-
ticed that was different. Also, it was
hard to have a positive experience
when I Carrie so late. 1 came a year
later than I thought 1 would and
missed orientation. Now that i look

back on my first semester, I wish I
could have gone to orientation. I be-
lieve it's crucial for all international
students to go to the orientation. I
felt lost for a semester, even though
many people were willing to help.
eror surprised you the most about
Gnnnell?

The biggest surprise was how liberal
the school was. The professors were
very accessible and the people were
really helprul. One of the biggest dif-
ferences about Students in the United
States was they didn’t know much
about the outside world, but most
were open to learning about differ-
ent cultures. Also, Iwas surprised by
all the diverse cultures here. People
come here from all over the world.
Overall, Grinnell has been an eye-
opening experience.

How did you ﬁnd out about Gn'nnell?
My parents knew some people in our
hometown who were American
alumni of Grinnell. They suggested
Grinnell to me and even wrote me a
recommendation. I felt, otter re.
searching Grinnell and vrsiting the
college campus that Grinnell was the
best choice for me.

What were yourﬁrst impressions upon
arn’vr‘rig in Wired?

People seemed normal enough to me.
1 guess I had some culture shock,
but it wasn't severe. Classes my first

semester were pretty easy, and so I
felt okay with the amount or schools
work. Right away I joined AstA and

What surprised you the most about
Gn'nnell?

Grinnellwas just like I expected. 1 did
think the town would be big, but it
was much smaller than I expected.
After the first semester, I had more
work to do and I had to adjust to
studying. this was hard for me as i
didn't have to study at all In high
