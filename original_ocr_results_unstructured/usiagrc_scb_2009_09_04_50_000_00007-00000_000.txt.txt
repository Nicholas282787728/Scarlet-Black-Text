“Imagine a hands popularity as u parabola," Alex Scheehter
'10, 2009710 SGA coneerts chair, said. “We try to get [a band]
right before they hit that peak ofthe parabola."

A common complaint among Grinnell students regarding
concerts is that they have never heard of the barrels that come
to rhe college. But as schechter said, “To some extent, rhar is
whar we are trying to do."

In a year, Schechrer hepes, people will be able to look at
these bands as they’ve grown more popular and be able to say
they saw the band at Grinnell. “Not that we are trying to be
pretentious. ..[it’s] just the nature of the beast and the way the
budget works," he said.

In the past, Grinnell has brought in a variety ofartists. Last
year, “Wynton Marsalis was good,” Evan Hoelcett’iz said.

This semester's line-up embodies a wide spectmm otgenres
from electronic to rock re bluegrass. There are also traditional
and experimental hip—hop artists, a chzmcr style group, a sing-
cr/songwritcr and some jazz.

Yet despite this, “Thcrc's a constant complainr that all we
get are indie bands, which is a really. ., problematic way ofclasr
sifying a huge amount ormusic that is very diverse and lumped
into a very narrow genre," Schcchtcr said.

The committee not only works to bring in a variety of mu—
sic,buralso to ensure that the bands are ralten care ofby provid»
ing a green room with food and occasionally accommodations.
By doing most otrhe scheduling for the semester over rhe sum-
mer, the committee was able to book such bands as WHY? arid
Wavves. as well as rapper Kool Keith as Dr. Octagon,“1t's mind
blowing that we got him," Scliechter said.

Although the concert committee has worked to pull in
some bigger shows, none have been booked in Harris, the big,
gcst venue on campus.

When Sebastian Tellicr played in Harris lasr year, the results
were mixed. “Wt: got really weird feedbdck from the band. .it
kinda relr like they were playing in a high school gymnastum,"
Sclicchtcr said.

According to Schechtet, Hams shows harbor a variety of
other challenges as we].l.They are usually the bigger shows, but
because so much is going on at Grinncll at one time, it can be
hard to fill up the space,which can be awkward for the band.

Harris shows also require a lor of exrernal support beyond
the concert committee‘s control, including rhe need to bring
in an outside sound system. As a result, this semester's shows
have been booked in other venues, including Bob's. Gardner,
and a neon show on 10/10, the infamous illlrcampus party, in
Herrick.

The first show ofthc semester is My Name is Nobody (with
M. Trckd) on sep. 8. According to their Myspaee, the band is
based in Birmingham, UK and are inﬂuenced by such bands as
The Smiths, MORRISSEY, and Joy Division.

“We've got a really sweet lineup for this semester," Schcch—
tet said. Grinncll students tend to value shows as diverse and
broadly inﬂuenced as they arc and this semester shouldn’t let
them down.

Don Garcia'll commented on thc range and role ofshows
on campus. "I think [concerts] just adds to Gnnnell’s personals
