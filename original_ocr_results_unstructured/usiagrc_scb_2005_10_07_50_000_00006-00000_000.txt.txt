Bad Education (R)

Gael Garcia Betnal is a superb actor (who is so
beautiful as a men I’m not sure whyl was so surprised
that he was also the most beautiful woman in the
film), who portrays a character with multiple person-
alities, genders and moniker: in La Mala Educ/1min
(BadEdthian).

Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez) and Ignacio Roe
drigniez (Bernal) were two boys in love in a Christian
school. Father Padre Manolo (Daniel Giménez Ca-
eho) prohibited and disavowed their love for selfragr
grandizing reasonsihe loved one of the boys. Now
adults, Enrique, a successful gay film director, is vis-
ited by Ignacio, who has written a “true” account of
their time together in schooland gives Enrique a copy
to read. Enrique decides to use the script as material
for a new film and plans to feature Ignacio as one of
the characters; however, Enrique begins to question
whether this is truly the Ignacio from his childhood.

The film alternates between the past, when lgnar
cio and Enrique were in love during Christian school
and the involvement of Padre Manolo, and two later
meetings between the characters—during the late
'70s and again in the 19805.

It is possible that the character of Enrique is at
least partially based upon the life of director Pedro
Almodovar. There are many parallels between A17
modovsr and Enrique, particularly during the ’80s,
which is the era when the “present" scenes of Bad
Education are set. Almodovar seems to include the
deviant elements (such as cross-dressing, transvestites,
inﬁdelity, homosexuality, false identity, selfrereation,
aesthetics of beauty, fantasy of selfrdeception, falling
in love, rape, fetishism, child molestation, etc.) per»
functorily, as though this is the only way he knows
how to direct a film,

I enjoy Almodovar’s films so much because, while
they feature behaviors deviant from societal norms,
they are certainly behaviors which occur in each socir
ety and which, 1 think, are eschewed by the majority
of ﬁlm directors and writers. In L11 Mala Edulﬂtwlil,
Almodévar moves away from the vibrant colors, quix-
otic cinematography and proclivity their are rift: with
in his previous films to let the camera speak for itself.
He does retain the wonderful ability to create meta-
phors (the blood trickling down young Ignacio’s face
as he splits his head open and the multiple extensions
of his character he later cultivates) and a melancholy,
deviant tone throughout the film.

character development and a skeletal plot that no
amount of marketing could make financially success-
ful.

However, as unpalatable as the film may appear to
the viewer with more conventional tastes, its powerful
emotional resonance is unusual for a film in any genre
and makes The Sin/mi ﬂgmu an exceptional movie
going experience.

The Slﬂ/foﬂAgL'lll is the story ofFln McBride (Per
ter Dinklage), a dwarfwho has found refuge from a
hostile and judgmental world in an obsession with
trains. He works in a model train shop, and when his
boss and only friend, Henry (Paul Benjamin), dies,
he bequeatlls to Pin a small abandoned rail station in
rural New Jersey. With the shop permanently closed,
Fin moves into the station with his few worldly pos-
sessions and settles in, comfortable with the solitude
and the opportunity for train watching that it pm.
vides.

However, much to Fin's cliagiin, the incessantly
friendly and talkative joe (Bobby cannuvule), who
runs a t’ood cart near the station, insists on engaging
Fm in conversation and friendship. Fin soon finds his
world even more crowded when he unwillingly gains
another friend in Olivia (played tremendously by Par
tric'ia Clarksoii), an emotionally distraught artist who
lives nearby.

The film follows the growth of the threesomes
unlikely friendship and the resulting breakdown of
the barriers Fin has constructed to deal with a reality
in which he is defined only by his height.

It is difficult to articulate exactly what makes TI]:
Station Agni: great. Perhaps it is the film’s exceptional
ability to demonstrate the beautiful power and com—
plexity of friendship while managing to not descend
into sappy melodrama. Or perhaps it is the actors
convincing performances of richly textured and her
lievable characters. However, there is little doubt that
writer and director Tom McCarthy has created a film
capable of making a lasting impression by reminding
us that individuals are inescapably and simultaneously
capable both of cruel judgment and remarkable ems

murdcrball, where the competitors who have all lost
some function in all of their limbs, crash into each
other while riding in wheelchairs that can only be
described as small tanks. Doesn’t sound like a handi-
capped sport? Well prepare to have your preconcepr
t‘tons smashed err ..: murdered.

Mint/iron” has all ofthe great Hollywood sport
movie archetypes: a fierce rivalry between the Ameri-
cans and the Canadians, a star player (Mark Zupan
who sports tattoos and :i bad ass demeanor), and the
traitorous Joe Scares, who defected from the U.S. to
become the Canadian coach after years of being the
best player on the American team. But Min-derby]! is
not a Hollywood movie, and as such we get to see the
more human side ofthe story. From Zupan's reconcilir
ation with his high school best friend, whose drunken
driving put him in a wheelchair, to the stressed father-
son relationship between soares the uber-joclt and his
son, who tends more toward the academic and musir
cal, thlmbtzl/ presents the realrlife drama of these
athletes with no family—friendly fluff

The real life day-to-day issues of being a quad
riplegic are also a major part of the film. Issues such
as getting dressed, getting into a chair and personal
relationships are dealt with, and we are even shown
clips from an instructional video on quadriplegic sex.
During the course of the film one gains an under
standing of the hardships that one faces everyday as a
quadriplegic, and how people adapt to being disabled.
Murder/ml] is a film that shows the triumph of the
human spirit over disability.
