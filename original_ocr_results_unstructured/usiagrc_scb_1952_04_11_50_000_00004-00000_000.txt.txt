The play, a satire bordering
on farce, has been presented at
Crinnell three times. This is
the first faculty production,
however. i

The setting of the play is inl
Bulgaria during the winter of

the Balkan War in 1885-86.

The play was first presented
to the public in‘London on
April 21 1894, almost 53 years
ago to the day. At the close of
the performance, » playwright
Shaw stepped out between the
curtains and took a bow. Amid
the thunderous applause, a
young man in the balcony booed
loudly.

”I quite agree with you, my
friend.” Shaw called out to him,,
“but what can we two do
against a whole houseful of the
opposite opinion."
