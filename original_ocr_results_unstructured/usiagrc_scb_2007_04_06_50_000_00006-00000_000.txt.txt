Cult classic

Campy, sex-charged Rocky Horror Picture Show
celebrates all that is weird tonightat Harris

BY RACHEL FIELDS

Grinnell is no stranger to the art of
sexual humor , campus conversations
are ﬂooded With It. But every year, the
cast of The Rot/gr Horror Pic/hrs Show
pushes campus sexuality a little fur
ther by dancing in their underwear to a
movie that Invites callbacks like Watch
out for the slut—eating birdbathl"

“Every year, someone will get of
fended and leave," said cast member
Ben Bowman ‘08. “But the point is that
it’s so offensive, it’s ludicrous and silly."

The campy Tic Ror/ryHonor I’Itl’wc
Show began as a movie ﬂop in 1975,
unpopulsr until fans developed an
elaborate system of audience interac-
tion to accompany
the film, While
the movie plays,
a group of (05-
tunied perform-
ers act out the
scenes, mouthing
the words as the
audience shouts responses to the actors
lines. “Then: are always enough people
who know the callbacks," said co-direc-
tor Benji Cantor-Stone ’07.“People use
different callblcks at different theaters,
so we get a varietv.

In previous years, the Rocky cast was
decided through seniority and group
consensus, a system that porcnrrally
limited the pool of cast members.This
year, under the direction of Canton
Stone, Amanda McGillvr-ay ’08, Ben
Osburg'OS and Greta Swanson '08, the
show held open auditions for the ﬁrst
time. “We wanted to'open it up and
make it fair to everyone who wanted to

be rn the show," said McGillvray

”/ love Seeing the look on {he virgins’
fates when the all/barks start.”
Ben Osburg ’08, (0-diIEClOl

In preparation for the Show. the
actors must learn to follow the movie
without constantly checking the screen
for cues. Since this presents a challenge
(or n frlm almost two hours in length,
the cast began rehearsal at the begins
ning of February. “I watched the movie
twice a day, every day during [spring
break]," said Swanson. "Ifyou ask how
often we've seen it, the answer is ‘too
much.”

In order to peIsonalize the show
for a Grinnell audience, the Rat/5y cast
has developed a set of Grinnell related
callbacks “We try to use as much of
the Grinnell attitude as possible,” said
MeGillvray, citing callbacks such as
“An RKO produv
tion? No wonder
it sucks!”

Roctyi liberal
attitude towards
sexuality also
rnvttes the pos—
sibility of gender-
bcnding A casting female actors in male
parts, and vice versa,“1've been cast as
a female Rocky, and there was a female
Frank my first year," said Mccrllvray,
who plays rlris ycar's Frank. “Genders
bonding is common in this show."

Though Bowman enjoys “an audi-
ence of people who have seen the show
before", the group agrees that the best
Rusty audience is a mix of“virgins" and
experienced viewers.The cast members
cite the shock value aspne of the most
enjoyable parts ofthc show. “I love sees
irrg the look on the virgins' faces when
the callbacks start," Osburg said.

Singer Kurt Elling offers jazz with a touch of Proust

Kurt Elling, a musician whose voice and musical
interpretations are as unique and lively as the songs
he sings, will croon, scat, swing and, if we're lucky,
tam in Herrick Chapel next Thursday. The interna-
uonally acclaimed jazz vocalist will be accompanied
by an equally talented quartet, Laurence Hobgood
(pianist), Rob Amster (bassist), Willie Jones (drums),
and Kobie Watkins (drums).

We're in the midst ofa serious drought of male
jazz vocalists, and in an age where jazz lingers dangers
ously on the edge of extinction, Elling has emerged
as a beacon of promise with an approach all his own.
Elling's baritone voice, which spans four octaves, is
as powerful as the voices of some of his classic int
ﬂuences (Frank Sinatra, Ella ngerﬂld and Joe Wil-
littms, to name a few) but has an edge reminiscent
of his more contemporary influences (lon Hendrit
and Mark Murphy), Despite his masterful technique
and the phenomenal, diverse capabilities ofhrs voice,
Elling's stylistic choices may make him difﬁcult for-
more traditional—minded listeners to embrace While
his creative use of rhythm, improvisation, and phrasr

ing make him refreshing (especially for ears jaded
byg recent lackluster jazz), his timbre and tone may
make him less accessible. In his lower vocal register,
his voice carries a giavelly sound quality, which stands
out in contrast to the bright, nearly nasal timbre ofhis
higher notesia unique combination to say the least.

Though Elling’s distinctive sound may turn off
some listeners, his artistic contributions to the music
world can be appreciated by all. He received no nrusis
cal training in college; he actually pursued his educas
tion at a small Midwestern liberal arts school (sound
familiar?), Gustavus Adolphus. He then studied the
philosophy of religion at the University of Chicago
Divinity School, intending to become a professor.
Rather than followrng a typical academic path, El-
ling has successfully wed his intellectual interests to
his musical endeavors. A vocalist, lyricist, poet, COIHT
poser, producer, director and arranger, Elling has ins
corporated his Interest in literary ﬁgures like Keiouac,
Neruda and Proust iirto his artistic works

His literary inﬂuences and education also seem
to have inspired the meditative lyrics of his origit

nal vocaleses, a jazz technique where artists set lyr»
ics to famous instrumental' jazz solos and sing them
“Ranting" rs another unique method Elling is famous
for which plays on his lyrical and improvisational
strength; rather than simply scatring or doing a lyri»
cal improvisation, Elling is known for creating both
lyrics and melodic lines on the spot.

Beyond music, Elling has even stepped into the
theatre world; in 1998 he Was commissioned by Chi»
crgo's Steppenwolf Theatre to create a show based
on Alan Ginsberg's lrfe and poetry. His strong inrels
lectual background shines through in his consistently
profound and thoughtful vocal interpretations ofjazz
standards.

Elling brings to the table an inimitablc,wellrconr
trolled voice directed by a novel and hip style that
has helped reinvent jazz for our generation l—lis frrre
technique and refreshing arrangements of classic
standards will surely make for a performance that's as
interesting, unique and insprrrng as he is, Don't miss
this one.
