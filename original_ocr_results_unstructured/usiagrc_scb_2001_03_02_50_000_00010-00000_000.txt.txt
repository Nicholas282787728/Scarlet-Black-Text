Sweatshop response

Dear Editor:

Nothing have 1 found more agreeable in the last issue of
Scarleté'Bhtlz than the letter hy varun Bhat in opinion. The
antitsweatshop cause at ctinncll has perhaps presumed a far
greater representation of the voice of the entire student body
than they actually carry. Posters and signs of the anti.sweat.
shop cause has been ubiquitous on campus since I arrived at
Grinnell in 1999, at times to the point ofannoyancc. Like Varun
suggested, this oveiaealous pursuit of the anti.sweatshop cause
has undoubtedly turned Grinncll from a place ofhigher leame
ing into a social institution,

I helicve it is equally important to voice the unconcern
about this issue among an unignorahle part of the student body,
The fact that many of us are fed up with the issue does not
translate into our condonation ofsweatshops; rather, like Varun
suggested, there are simply too many other domestic matters
more pressing and immediate that we could be dealing with
otherwise:

From the desk of
a sell-out

Since leaving Grinnell college in the spring of 1999, l
have scanned the on line version of the 5 d B several times.
Call me nostalgic, but reading about the happenings makes me
happy and reminds me of my not so long ago days as a
Grinnellian Reading the most recent issue, however, finally
made me understand something: 1 now know why my parenu
looked at me like i was crazy when I complained that Gtinncll
wasn't catering to my every whim. let me explain

Now, there is a coke machine in my office here in Chia
cage. I prefer Coke, hutwhat ifl preferred Pepsi? Now. accord.
ing to Mr. Brofman, 1 should be able to walk down the hall
into the President's othce and demand that a current poll be
taken of the employees soda preferences. After all, this is what
the author is demanding ofDining services not only for this
situation, but as a symbol ofselhgovernanoe at its ﬁnest, After
all, isn't selftgovtrnancc about your right to drink what you
want and have it conveniently located? Isn’t it ahout your right
to demand a recount if the pesky majority votes in favor of
coke.) Or better yet, demand that Dining services provide you
with side by side Coke and Pepsi machines.> Moreover, isnt it
about your right to increase costs for Dining Services ifyour
preferences happen to cost more? And of course, isnt it your
right to complain ahout rising tuition, inflated room and board
eosrs, and the evertpopular endowment? ofcourse it ls. After
all, you're a Grinnellian. Soam l, orat least I was for fouryears.
Now, however, as a former Grinnellian and an upstanding, tass.
paying citizen, 1 feel that it is my duty to enlighten the author
and others of the same perspective about an interesting phe
nomenon: the world of the corporate sell.out who had to get a
joh to pay her hills. But I digress,

Only in Grinnell

Now, back to the carhonation situation herein my office.
let's say 1 prefer Pepsi. l contemplate this preference for a while,
create my argument, and knock on the presidents door She
looks up from her desk asks, whats up? and 1 proceed to
solemnly ask, Do you have a minute? 1 may even close the
door, due to the seriousness ofrhe pending conversation lskill.
fully explain to her that her decision to have a Coke machine in
the ofﬁce is not convenient for me, and helittles my love for
Pepsi, In fact, it reinforces the idea that Coke.lovcrs are better
than pepsielovers, if for no other reason than coke has been
puhlicly deemed the President's Choite. l finish with my argu.
ment, and sit satisfied,
waiting for the answer 1
know will come: “Oh
Stephanie, 1’11 run right out
and buy you a pepsi ma-
chine to avoid the civil
rights lawsuit 1 know you’re
contemplating." This ana
swer does not come.
Rather, she says: “Uh.
thercs pepsi downstairs in
the cafeteria. Co huy some
and where is that report i
asked for yesterday?" Of
course, :he's really think.
ing, “Who in God's name
convinced me to hire a self.
righteous lihetal arts gradwith no husiness coursework or hands.
on crperience and a mouth the sire ofa vending machine?"

Now, maybe my office is different than othets'out there,
Maybe other company presidents would listen to my needs,
engage me in a discussion related to how much my time is
worth, and attempt to reach a compromise that would enrich
my working environment. Unfortunately, 1 work in a liheral,
woman owned and operated consulting firm, and in my sis
forts to meet my own carbonation needs, 1 have failed to real
lze: 1) it. the time it took me to contemplate said needs, for.
mulate a coherent argument, and talk with my boss, 1 have
madeenough money to huya tasseofPepsi, and 2) 1 sound like
an idiot.

Of course, 1 sold out to corporate America, so maybe 1
just don't get it anymore.

After all, isn’t self-
governance about
your right to drink
what you want and
have it conveniently
located? Of course it

Grinnellian.

Tuition concerns

This was originally going to he a random rant, butl real.
izcd 142 words was not enough for me to ﬁnish expressing my
frustrations.

1 am disturhcd and upset about the unjust 7.5 percent
increase in comprehensive fees for next year. First of all, Presi—
dent Osgood's letter, which he claimed was “a pleasure to write,"
is misleading. While our comprhensive fees are being raised
“only" 7.5 percent, tuition is being raised 9 percent. Further
more, Osgood states that “Since we are committed to meeting
the financial needs ofour students, our scholarship and ﬁnan-
cial aid hudget will see corresponding growth next year." The
truth ofthe matter is that only students with need haserl aid
will see an increase in their financial aid packages nzxt year.
students with tnistee honors scholarships, for example, will have
to come up with another $1930.

it bothers me that the decision to increase tuition by such
an exorbinant amount was made by trustees and the president
who have no conception of what it is like to have to make fi.
nancial sacrifices in order to attend college. I wonder if the
trustee are aware ofthe repreeussions their decision will have
on individual studentsz I wonder how many students will have
to transfer because they will not longer he able to afford the
cost ofcoming to Gtinncll?

The President's letter states, "the Board has approved a

Lasth 19 29 _

is. After all, you're av

7. 5 percent in our comprehensive fee 1 believe the sentence
was supposed to read, the Board has approved a 7 5 percent
increase in our comprehensive fee in the very sentence when
President osgood reveals the exact percentage increase, there is
a typo. In a college which promises a rigorous and rich aca.
demic program one would think there would at least he
competant copy editors.

ln reality, the college does not need to increase tuition at
all. Grlnnell has a one billion dollar endowment, and not mat.
ter how sluggish the stock market may he, that money is not
going any where i do not agree wiui the trustees rationale for
raising tuition, and l would like them to know that many stu
dents are going to suffer finantially (and, for those who have to
work during the school year, physically) as a result of their de.
cision.

At Grinnell, students pride themselves on having a voice
in the decisions of the college, but when it comes to financial
decisions we are completly powerlexxa There is no amount of
political advocacy that will thange the trustees’ minds. The only
purpose this letter will serve is to allow me to vent some ofmy
frustration.

Hy-Veerwas right

Dear Editors,

1 was a little disturbed when reading Andrew cole s ran
dom rant over town relations The studenu were attempt.
ing to huy alcohol ILLEGALLY; translation: you were hteake
ing the law and you knew it. I don't understand why you would
he upset at Hy.vee to do the lawful thing, for which they are
obligated by lowa state Law, and ticket the individual who was
hreaking the law. it upsets me that you would call Hy—V:e "jack.
asses" for abiding by the law. In my opinion, Hyth: has an
excellent relationship with the college students. l‘m 21 and I
frequently buy alcohol there. Many ofour Diftcampus students
buy their groceries there. 1 don‘t think, just because Hy-Vcc
was abiding by lowa Law equates them to hating college stu
dents, as you would claim.

Furthermore. I think this “random rant" had very little
journalistic integrity, and in my (not-so-humble) opinion, the
Scotland Burk should not have printed it. Come on folks, in
a time when we‘re trying to extend [own-gown relations, why
print an article that calls a local business a “jzckzss” for follow.
ing the 11w?

This is my personal opinion, and maybe others feel differa
ently, but the scarkrand Brie/e should not he promoting the
idea that crinnell college students have an inherent right to
purchase alcohol illegally. l know you have the disclaimer that
the opinion article View: are not necessarily yours, but you still
have authority over what to print. that is what makes you an
editor.

My hat takes a lot of courage to wear It has a -

goofy red poof that inspires ridicule. My sister, the
arbiter ufﬁshion, tells me i shouldn‘t wear it» and at
home, 1 feel too silly and hicky to wear it among the
manicured lawns and sophisticated urban people. Some
times I wear it here- it is so formidably cold in the
Midwestern wasteland, hate it, 1 hate it, when the
temperature rises (hey! ’s 15 degrees!) 1 limply hold
it rather than face deserved scorn“. although some
ennnelians have actually told me they like my hat,
Strangers mostly, and 1 love them for it. Without their
praise, 1 think 1 would have given in long ago, and
bought one from the Gap. Now 1 take a foolish, per.
haps pitiful pride in my hat, whether it has a death
grip around my forehead or it dangles from my hand.
Now, lcarny the hat with exuberance, 1 ﬂing it against
the ceiling, wield as a sober, whisk it away from the
clutches of greedy fingers... because in a silly pert

UK, First why is there no doorknob on the left door
of the INS 13b? This is ludicrous and serves no pur-
pose and always just makes you try to get a little hit
of door out with your ﬁnger and get enough leverage
to open the door, but this is rarely effective. Second, ,
why is the HF closed all day? They say because there
is no UC on duty, but there's no UC on second ﬂoor, so
who cares? Speaking of second ﬂoor, the computers
there sutK. They are always performing illegal shut-
downs or just randomly not letting you save, open
Netscape, the keyboards are not working etc. And
mostly it's the MACS that are not working, because
they pretty much suck in general. Logging in is a bitch
and the Screen always is in like 8-point fonts Third,
there is not nearly enough parking around the forum/
library. Fourth, when you do get a spot by the library
and try to back up you ﬁnd that instantly you HIT
THE CURB. If you have a big car, you may he stuck.
