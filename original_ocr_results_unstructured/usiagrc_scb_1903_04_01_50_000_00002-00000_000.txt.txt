on next Friday, April 3d. The
contesting schools will he Minna»
sota, Wisconsin, Chicago and
Grinnell, Minnesota and Wise
consin both have very strong
teams and it is thought that the
contest lies between these two
teams. Chicago is an unknown
quantity. Grinncll,however,does
not expectto leave Minneapolis,
without having made a good
showing. Wallcser, who ivon
three cups in thc gymnastic meet
last year, will again be Grinnell's
strongest supporter, and he will
be well supported by all his
team mates. The gymnasium
team has been doing faithful
work and has earned the honor
of representing Grinnell in this
contest, and fully descrvef the
places it will win. This nieet will
undoubtedly be a successful one
and will mean a great deal towald
encouraging work of this kind.
