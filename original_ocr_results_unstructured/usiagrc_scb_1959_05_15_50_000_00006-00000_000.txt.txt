So pick your pack—save the six wrappers-and get going! It's crossword puzzle fun and real

smoking pleasure all the way!

ENTER OFTEN—HAVE FUN—AND WIN! But think carefully! This puzzle is not as easy as it looks. AI:
ﬁrst the DOWN and ACROSS clues may appear simple. There may appear to be more than one "right”
answer. For example. the clue might read: “Many a coed will be given her best' date’s P- -N.” Either “1"
(PIN) or “E" (PEN) would seem to fit. But only one answer is apt and logical as decided by the judging stall",
and therefore correct. Read the rules carefully. ENTER AS OFTEN AS YOU WISH. Good luck!
