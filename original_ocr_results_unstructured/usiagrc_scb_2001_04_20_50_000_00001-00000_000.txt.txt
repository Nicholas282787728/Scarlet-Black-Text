dillnted at Giinncll college by
the FelninixtAction Coalition.
The feeus, aeeordrng to Mar.

honoring rhe memory of the
victims of violence against

and svtunl assault,

Sunday, Jamaimn-bom performanee poet staoyann
Chin will perform at Harris. “She's pretty smazing. so
we're really excited about that." said Feminist Action
Coalition member Sarah Hansen '04. “I had seen her
at a conference in Illinois in February, and both I and
everyone who had seen her were‘ really amared at her
performance."

The cornerstone oszke Bark the Night, however,
is the mlly and marsh selieduled for Monday night.

"The march is

standing up

l’niticipanu will leave the Forumzl9130 p.m. and wind
up ar the eominnniry oenrer downtown for separate
men's and women's disenssion groups. “There will he
rooms for both rhe women and men to go to speak in
to share emerions abour things rhat have happened to
rhern or their friends or loved ones," said Brook:
Fambtougli ’01.

“The march is a celebration of
strengrh and the power of rho
people who are standing up and
saying rape and domesrie violenee
is wrong," Fambmugl-l eontmued.

The match has been an annual
oreurrenee in Grinnell for about
renytars, originally, men were not
allowed to participate; that policy
changed a few years age, although
aeeordrng to a letter published at
the rime in rho Scarlet d heir/r,

The Take Back the Night rally has received some
eririeisrn for being eonfronrational in irs approaeh and
frightening nonparritipanrs, butotganlzets disagree. “I
do not think rhe march is roo eonfronrarional," said
Fambrough. “I Lhink rape and domesticviolence iscon-
fronrarionai."

“Perhaps many men do not understand whar it is
like to be a woman at nighttime, and rhe fear rhar ac-
companies it,” said orwig. “1 think that the mareh and
the chants give women who have been afraid. some-
times their enrire lives, a sense of empowerment."

Nonetheless, some men and women report feeling
inrinaidared by rhe marchers. “I go out or my way not

to be out when they're going around campus shout.
ing," said a female senior, who asked not to be identi-
fed.

“1 think it’s eounrerproduetivo." said Aaron Wright
'02. “I think irthe real purpose is to reduce gender.
basedviolenss. then marohing around campus one night
a semoter scaring the ctzp our ofeveryone else does no
good, and makes them seem lik: part of the lunatic
fringe."

The days when men in the mareh's parh reported
being verbally harassed, on rhe other hand, are a thing
of the past. And along wirh the intrusion or men in
Take Bark the Night, there have been some other
rhangas over the years,

This year’s festival is signifieanrly larger than last
years, aeeording to Mattie Johnson '0 1, because far mot:
people have pitched in to help organize it. “This year,
afrer a twoyear dedine in the Sim ofrhe feminist group
on ssmpus, there is a large, strong core group ofsbout
20 people who are committed to making things hap»
pen,” she said. “There are more evenu going on this
year because wirh lers of partieipation it is easier to ot-
ganize events and make them work."

orwig said sh: hopes the week-long series ofcvcnts
will eonrinue next year. In addition, she said, “I hope
to see more people involve themselves. it seems that
TBTN speakers at Grinnell are a largely hemogenous
group. The truth is thatviolenee affeers all women, and
I’d like to hear some different voices."

Fambrough would like ro see more of the Campus
ger involved in fighting sexual assault. “1 would like for
it not to be something people think about onc: a year.”
she said, ”because for many people it is somerhing rhsy
cannot help bur think about every day."

Joint Board debates paying Corley’s lawyer

by E ri k G a b i e

Following 1 contentious debate, Joint Board voted Wednme
day nighr ro provide $650 for a speeeh by rhe lawyer representing

spesoh.

Rick Corlcy '03, the student charged

was denied- he Ll‘lcn explained rhat rliesnso was to pay rhe lawyers
honrl y fee for doing research on the east in preparation for her

Vice President George Carroll ’02 commented that Dean of

hind the proposal. “The way rhrs eomes off to me is, maybe rhis
is inst Rick Corley's friends feeling bad for him and trying to gar

him some money" for his legal defense. he said.

Student Aﬂairs'l‘om Cmdy had offend to have

one senator moved to table rhe proposal so toastituears could
be consulted, but the motion failed with only six senators in sup-

wirli allowing underage drinking at the
Mary B. James ball on April 7.

The proposal. whrrh was presented
by Ben Gold ’01, and PanlChukin '01,
on behalfefrlievegan coop, Flcchte
Planer and other oampns groups, had
originally been to pay Cotlcy $500 to
speak, but was ehanged when it was
disrovered thst the rollege would not
pay honoraria to rurrtnrstudents

Early in the discussion, Andy
Civcttini ’01. senator from Loose,
asked wlierlier the proposal was just a
way of paying corleys legal fees under the table. Gold asked that
Civertinis question he strurk from the minutes, but his requtsr

one oftht colleg:'s lawyers speakabonr the case,
Gold said Corley'x lawyer wonld have more in-
formation about the evenrs oprril 7, while
Civettini eonntrrsd that the college's lswyars
would be more familiar with the sthoolls in-
surance policy.

Carroll asked whether SGA would he pays
ing for research that the lawyer would already
be doing, as part ofhtr work for corley. Yes,
we are paying for a oonple hours of Ricks dc-
fense, ssid Gold.

Katherine Wolf’Ol. occo senator. said,
“tonsidering the administration isn’r support»
mg Rick. ,. maybe we don’t wear their lawyer,"

Aaron Hollobaugh ’02, Langan, questioned the motives bcr

port. “W: don’t ever table budgets to rake them back to out soar
xtitllents," said Paul Ford ’02, occo.

Aid-rough some senators felt rhsr Joint Board should not con-
tribute to the defense ofa student ehargodwirh violating stare law.
more believed that a spseth by corlsy’s lawyer would provide the
eampus eommuniry wirh valuable informarion.

John Aemi '01, OCNCO, added thar he could arrest to the
tan that one of the students who was drunk at Mary B. James
never entered the Harris Concert Hall, eonhrming Corley's Slater
ment rhar the strident was never served beer by parry staffers,

The budger proposal nlrimatsly passed by a wide mayoriry. .

"The way this comes off to
me is, maybe this is just
Rick Corley’s friends feel-
ing bad for him and trying
to get him some money [for
his legal defense.]"
