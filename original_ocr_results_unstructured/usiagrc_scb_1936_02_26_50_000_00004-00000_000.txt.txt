(Daily Trojan)

When the history of 1914-18 was set down iii‘ United States
history books, it stated plainly that the United States entered the
world war because German submarines were sinking United States
ships without warning, killing citizens of a neutral nation.

Today this reason is being challenged by the senate committee
on investigation of the munition industry, which is setting out to
prove, if possible, that the United States was sucked into the war
to assure repayment of their allied loans, In fact, George W.
Norris of Nebraska. had this same contention in 1917 when he
faced the senate end said, “We are going into war ilpon the com-
mand of gold, I feel that we are about to put the dollar sign
upon the American flag." Now there are others, mainly Senator
Gerald P. Nye, chairman of the committee on investigation. who
believe wall street bankers needed United States troops in the
field to save their loans.

J. Pier-pout Morgan is before the committee to discuss historical
events which took place 22 years ago, To questions pointed at
him he is frank in saying, “I cairt make up a memory." . His main
defense is the fact that things which the committee are tryipg to
prove Morgan and company did in secret. were actually done
publicly. Press accounts of the period substantiate this.

Chances are the widely heralded, histoiy making disclosures
will go the way of the findings of other senate investigations.
Pre-war prosperity was enjoyed by the entire ripper-crust of this
nation Everyone is paying for it today, Why put Morgan, alone,
on trial for his part in a war in which an entire country profited
for four years?

Long historical documents are bcing read. The Republicans
are making insinuations about the Democratic war president. The
Democrats are infuriated by the attacks on the integrity of
Woodrow Wilsonithe money is running out.

The public is beginning to yawn.

Negro Scientists

From Wastes

Tuskegee, Ala, (ACPl—, rom
wood shavrngs he has made syn-
thetic marble. From pe’anut shells
he has made insulating walls for
houses. From the muck of swamps
and the leaves of the forest floor
he has made valuable fertilizers.
From the common peanut he has
made 235 useful products, includr
ing milk, cheese, instant coffee,
pickles, oils, dyes, lard, shoving
lotions, shampoo, printer's ink,
and even axle grensel

Scientific marvels from noth-
ing, or almost nothing. such has
been the incredible achievement of
Dr. George Washington Carver,
distinguished Negro Scientist. who
[or 35 years has been director of
agricultural research at Tuskegee
institute, noted Negro school here.

From the lowly sweet potato
he has made 118 pioducts, among
them flour, sterch, library paste,
vinegar, shoc polish. ginger, ink,
rubber compound. chocolate com-
pound. molasses and cornmels.

From the clays of the earth he
has made non-fading paints and
pigments. From worn-out sandy
soil he has produced paying crops
, Boxn in a rude slave cabin in
Missouri about 713 years ago (Dr.
Carver does not know the exact
date) he began his education with
a. Webster blue-book speller. To;
day his honors include a Bachelor
of Science, Master of Science, hone
orary Doctor of Science, winner
of the Spingarn medal for Negro
achievement, member of the Royal
Society for the Encouragement of
Arts, Manufactures and Come
mercc of Great Britain.

The aging Negm’s versatility
is remarkably demonstrated in
fields other than science. Dr. Car-
ver is an accomplished artist, and
is especially skilled in painting
flowers. His works have been ex-
hibited at world fairs, and some
arc to be hung in the Luxembourg
gallery in Paris after his death,
He makes all his own paints, us-
ing Alabama clays, He makes his
paper from ,pcanut shells, and the
frames for his pictures are made
from corn hiisks.

Dr. Carver is a skilled musician
and once toured the country as a
concert pianist. To top these ace
complislimciits, he is an expert
cook, and recipes, originated by
him are used today in leading ho-
tels throughout the country, ,

By his work in agriculture rind
chemistry, Dr, Carver has been
able to serve his own people and
lighten their burdens. Experts say
that he has done more to rehabilir
late agriculture in the South than
any other man living,

"When you do the common
things of life in an uncommon
way," Dr. Carver once said to his
students, "you will command the
attention of the world." In that
sentence lies the secret of his own
achievement,
