DINING ROOMS

Here We Go Aagin .’

Definite progress is. being made in the
foods department, we are unhappy to repoit.
Meals are becoming progressively worse!

We hate to keep harping on this same old
theme. Miss Gleason and her staff started the
fall semester by serving excellent meals. We
were free with our praise in a glowing editorial,
and we were thereafter able to devote our time,
efforts and editorial space to loftier subjects.

Since then, however, the foods department
has once again lapsed into its typical lethargic
slumbers and has been shoving before the stu-
dent body the most unbelievable variety of
TRIPE. ”Quite representative are these ex—
amples: Monday noon—hard, stale, crusty
spaghetti (obviously salvaged from Saturday
noon’s spaghetti leftovers), which was horrible
on Saturday and ten times worse on Monday;
Monday nightitough, greasy meat, practically
inedible; Tuesday noon—stew with a disagree-
able foreign taste and odor. We could go on
citing examples indefinitely. We do not know
exactly whom they are trying to fool.

Equally outrageous is the fact that mem-
bers of the football squad arrive at dinner night
after night and are faced with cold food which
has been standing on the training tables for as
long as one-half hour. The foods department
REFUSES to cooperate.

Ill addition, Miss Gleasonmefuses to coope-
rate w' h he C of HP. She demands certain
responsib 'es of them, such as the governing
of general etiquette in the dining room. She
ﬂatly states, in return, that she will not be re-
sponsible to any student group for anything.

At brwkfast, students may either (1) eat
cold toast and eggs and fresh cereal, or (2) eat
warm toast and eggs and soggy cereal. There,
is no cream on each' individual table. MISS
GLEASON WILL NOT COOPERATE.

So you see what we’re all up against. We
all have our cross to bear. The common enemy
is the absolute and unqualified refusal to coope-
rate on the part of the foods department.

HEIL NELLIEE!

STUDENT UNION ‘

Here We Go Again .’

We feel that the Union, in general, has
been fulfilling its function as a service to stu»
dents of Grinnell college. However, we find
there are certain instances where this service

‘ falls short of its possibilities.

Why is it that personal checks cannot be
cashed in the Union? The excuse that it would
require keeping more change on hand is hardly
valid, as a five or ten dollar bill
much change as a check for like amount.

Merchants in town honor the vouchers of
campus organizations, and it seems strange to us‘
that a college service cannot do as much.

Why doesn’t the Student Union, like other
feed services, cater ‘to the Grinnellians’ predil—
etion for HOT rolls with their coffee?

We recommend:

1. That the Union honor the personal
checks of students. Perhaps a maximum amount
of five or ten dollars should‘ be established.

2, That the patronage of the student halls,
cottages, and other organizations be encouraged
by the acceptance of their vouchers.

3. That the rolls be warmed.

0N SOUTH CAMPUS
Peace Pipe Passed! .

Smith hall preps may well have sighed with
relief at the announcement that their "chal-
lenge" of the Read hall girls to a hockey game
had fallen through this week.

The spirit evidenced in the recent hockey
contest between Haines and Read was lusty
enough to make any freshman gaze speculative»
1y at his knees and shins, and wish that his
prepping days were over.

Climaxing a pregame due] of wits as spirit-
ed as that of freshman class candidates, Read
hall rooters kidnapped Haines housechairman,
Nancy Boman, demanding as ransom Read's
stolen athletic trophies.

After the big game was over, and Miss Bo-
man and the trophies exchanged, a peace pipe
was passed around at a Homes-Read party,
signifying the end of friendly hostilities. .

Does it have to end here, or can south
campus spirit outlast the hockey season?

STATE OF THE CHAPEL

Decorators expect to have the chapel walls painted
by Tuesday, according to the foreman of the working
crew. The next job of decoration cannot start unul
carpenters have [inlnshed paneling the front and back
\valls.

If wood is available, the wall beneath the clock will
be dark paneled to match side walls, In case this can-
not be put in, plains have been made to stain the wall

Letters To The Editor

To the Editors of the Scarlet
and Black
From: The President of the

Collcgc

Ra: sindcnc ompioymont

I am glad to respond to the
opcn letter published by the edi-
tars in the Oct, 15 issue of thc
Scarlet and Black.

The problem of organizing stu-
dent work has been solved in many
different ways over the years. No
solution has been entirely satis-
factory, and I do not expect that
our present procedures Will meet
with uniform approval. When I
first came to Grlnriell I thought

,Lhat it would be very desirable

for a thorough-going job analysis
Io be carried on and a sound job

evaluation made. An investigation

of our work environment here re»
sulted in a modification of my
original intentions and its ulti~
indie abandonment.

It seems to me that our present
method of student placement and
remuneraton has certain cdvcnt
tuges not to be found in any other
system. In the first place we
eliminate a complex and difficult
system of administration. If we
had ten different jobs available
for freshmen, each one of which

paid a different rate. it would be‘

impossible for us to use student
labor with the same flexibility
that is now possible. Sincc all stu-
dents in the first term of employ-
ment receive the same wage; we
can~ move students about us need
arises and get the work of the
college done with a minimum
amount of tension and difficulty.
Imagine how hard it would be to
have a freshman who is in a job
classified at 60:: an hour moved
lo a job with a classification of
ﬁne an hour. There would he re-
s.sfancc and resentment.

In the second place. by remun-
exuiing students in terms of the
year of service, we do gradually
pay the highest rate for the woik
requiring more experience.

Thirdly, when we place our
wage scale on a seniority basis
without respect to the type of
Work done, we recognize the es-
sentiality of all the woik done by
students on the campus, and we
give to each student, according to
his length of service, an equal re-
ward.

This system is not perfect. It is
simplc, It is easy to administer,
and it does enable us to distribute
student employment better than a
more conventional pattern of work
organization would permit.

Several other comments need to
be made. In many schools a, policy

exists which might be described.

as a “barter" policy, as a student
does so much work for the col—
lege and gets so much credit for
what he does. So a man waits on
a table and gets c meal, 01‘ he
works for a. certain department
and gets paid in the form of tui-
tion credit. No Cash is exchanged
and no direct value is given to
the work done in terms of an
hourly rate of pay. Where this

system is consistantly employed,

no mention is ever mcdc of hourly
rates. No student is cvci paid
anything in cash. This system does
not seem to be a very useful one
at Grinnell. It was tried years ago
and was abandoned.

Your letter makes a. special case
for student waiters. This involves
a puymcn‘! in kind system which
I have criticized in an Earlier
paragraph. This year we are
charging 51.70 per day for food.
Under our present pay schedule
a student working slightly more
than 3 hours a day at our present
minimum wage of 50c an hour in
the dining room would be able to
pay for his heard through his
earnings as a waiter, Our system
of hourly pay for wsitcis rather
than pay in kind makes possible
a. more economically I‘un dining
room, closer supci-vision of student
workers, and better food adminis-
tration, We do not believe that it
would be wise to go back to a
system which was unsatisfactory
in the past.

I do not mean to suggest that
our employment policics arc en—
tircly satisfactory to the adminis-
tration, It is ti-uc, however, that
we see the pi-oblcms which are
related to student employment
from a different perspeccive than

that of the student, The collcgc
makes work available to students
under conditions which are most
favorable to the student, Foi- the
most part his work occurs at a
time which causes it to have ii
minimum negative effect on his
study program. While the student
Work is essential and we could not
very woll get along Without it, it
should not be thought of in the
same manner as full time work in
a. business or industry is consid-
cicd. There is an element of ac-
Comniodation in it which is impor-
tant for the student.

Our aim has been to make our
rates of pay competitive with all
the schools in our area and of a
premium nature in comparison
with most of them. So far as our
figures go, this policy has bccn
achieved. We do not anticipate
any basic change in rate of re-
muneration in the immediate fu-
ture.

It is not our desire to be arbi-
trary D!‘ dogmatic about our em-
ploylnent policies and procedures.
We will welcome frank and open
discussion with proper student
committees whenever such com-
mittens desire to share their ideas
and experiences with us. We shall
also be glad to have the advantage
of any field research which the
Editor of the sin; and his staff
may carry on. We want to give as
many students as much work as
they nccd, as is consistent with
the student's well being and as
may be available from time to
time in the college. We do not
wish to assume the responsibility
of supplying all of His work that
each student may need from With-
in the campus. We believe that our
placcmcnt service can bc of real
usefulncss in assisting studcnis to
secure town employment as Well
as in the effective administration
of our campus work. We want the
work conditions to be attractive,
and we hope to keep our wage
policy fair and just. The full 604
operation of all students interested
in the problem will be greatly ap-
preciated. ‘

may be that under our present

Dear Editor:

I think everyone will agree that
the recent effort made by the
Grinnell college health department
to protect the health of Grinncll
students through the administra-
tion of flu shots a particularly
commendable one.

In spite of this very practical
undertaking, I feel it nEcessaIy to
remind the health department of
the important role drinking foun-
tains play as potential'sources of
disease. More specifically, I refer
to the drinking‘ fountains in ARI—I,
some of which are not only inef—
fccfivc as water dispensers, but,
in my opinion, are also uns'anh
tary.

Elsewhere on campus more mo-
dern up-to-date drinking foun-
tains have been installed. Yet in
ARH, where hundreds of students
gather daily. the condition of sev-
cisl of the fountains is deplor-
able. Must this Continue?

Disc and Dial

Our two cents being long aver—
duc in this year’s sch. we hasten
to establish contact before compe—
tition gets too keen and every-
body gets into the act. This is
Pilkington again, sticking to the
bitter end.

Not that We went to duplicate
any previous Scratchings, but We’-
ve got to get in one more lick be-
fore Pee Wee Hui-it's “'nvelth
Street Rag” sinks into oblivion.
The success of the piece surprised
even the perpetrators of the crime,
sincc it was cut on a. transcrip-
tion for a gag, Ever since capitol
released it, the “ng" has been
pointing toward the million mark
'aﬂd is still Cap's biggest seller. ,

Also a surprise to pop fans is
the success of "Fiddle Faddle"
done by the Boston Pops Orches-
{1%. We suspect the reason we like
it is because its appeal is some-
thing like “Holiday For Strings."
The Rose, not the Jones version. ,

Although a Gene Autry original,
"Buttons and Bows" is done the
most ably by Dinah Shore. We
don't think the biscuit has receiv-
ed the share of publicity it cer-
tainly deserves. Also, the repress of
Billy Butterfield’s “Moonlight in
Vermont,"_ with Maggie Whiting on
the vocal, is going even better
than the original cutting.

In our humble opinion, Frankie.
Lhine's “.Ah, But It Happens” rates
right on top of his numbers along‘
with "Shine," the only difference
being that the former is done in
a. comparative whisper. -

George Halsey.

While the radio station does not

cnsiing stations no matter how

George Halsey said that the

I Grinnell Ten Years Ago

oh Stlldenis

Several years ago the Grinnell
ulumni all over the country were
in an uproar over the story can-
cci~ning former Grinllellian Gary
Cooper. Gary Cooper had been ic—
fuscd mcinbci-sliip in Pl Epsilon
Delta, the national (home frater-
nily the rumor said. Tile
issue was so hot that
tho 5&1} felt justified in discuss<
ing‘ it on the first page of a. ’38
Cditlon.

“Gary Cooper was not denied
moinbcrsliip in the National Col»
leglatc Players,” ci-ics flic sen.
In fact, there wasn’t cvoii a chap-
lci- on the campus at that time.”
What he was excluded from was
a cliquisli social group czllcd the
Grinnell dramatic club.

In 1929 this group was banned
from the campus, and a chapter

of the F) Epsilon Delta was estab-
lishcd. Cooper was given a shingle
and pin from fliis fraternity as
recognition of his work since leav-
ihg Gi~inncll. However, these were
not pi-cscntcd to Mr. Cooper, but
were left in the safe in «he Ragi-
stl'al"5 office, pending his return.

Gary didn't return, and his award
pci-ishcd in the fire that burned
the men's gym; otherwise, they
would probably still be around
somewhere.

‘ And Faculty

Did you ever Walk into uic
wrong class in your freshman year
and not discover it until you had
bccn there for quite c while? Well,
it happens to teachers foo. Doric
of 1938 congratulates Mr. Baum-
cnn for touching the wrong class
for 15 minutes before he discover-
ed if.
