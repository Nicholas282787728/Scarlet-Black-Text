The Junior Annual.

It has been the custom for a
number of years past tor the junr
ior class at the college to produce
an annual, anti prevrous to 1895.
when the class of '96 presented
The Merchant of Venice, these
annuals resembled the conven-
tional college annual very closely.
The class of '96 broke away from
the “annual rut" as did the class
ot ’97 the following year when
tiiey produced an original play
entitled “The Professor’s Dis-
covery.”

The class oi '98 has entered a
new ﬁeld also and has attempted
a work such as. to our knowledge.

. has never been attempted by ltll’
dergraduates helore. The '98 air
uual board has written and pubs
lished a volume of thirteen short
stories, with illustrations by Mr,
Frank \Ving, an ex-mcmber of
the class.

The book, which contains 247
pages with SIX illustrations repre
sents Iowa College work entirely,
the stories beingwritten by IUCITI'
bers or the class ot ’93.

No pains or expense has been
spared to make this little volume
a success in every way. The
board has been working on it a
little over a year, and knowing
the members who comprise the
board as we undergraduates do.
there can be no doubt btlt that
the book will be an honor to the
college.

The class have dedicated their
book to Prof. S. L. Whitcotnb, '87,
whose advice and encouragement
has been of inestintable value to
them.

The annual will probably be on
sale the last of next week at all
three book stores in Grinnell
when it is hoped a large sale
be the result, The ﬁrst edition
will be composed oi Soc volumes.
The book is printed on hard ﬁn-
ish hand made paper, well bound
in a tasteful cover of scarlet and
black, with an illustration on the
front cover by Mr. wing.

Mr. Charles Wells Moulton of
Buffalo, N. Y., has copyrighted
and published the book and will
spare no pains to introduce a large
sale all over the United States. It
\\’l‘l be on sale the principal
bookstores of the United States as
soon as the’edition is complete.
