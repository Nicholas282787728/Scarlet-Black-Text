The programs as delivered rn both

well received. The prospect oi a
joint debate between them seems
to have increased interest

The Glee Club.

The Iowa College Glee Club, in
entering last fall upon its tltird
year of existence, could eongiaitr
late itseli upon past achievements,
which would do credit to a much
older organization. From a very
humble beginning, when its exist-
ence was scarcely known outside
of a limited college circle, it has
grown, step by step, by dint of
patient work and careful drill, in»
to probably the most popular, and
in some ha 9, the most inﬂuential
of college organizations. Tire
growth in the popular estimation
of the value ot nrernhership s vely
clearly shown in the [act that. in
response to Prot. Cole's call tor a
nieetingoiallstudentsinterestedin
forming a Glee Club, only twenty
appeared, of whom sixteen had to
be chosen. while the second year,
seventeen appeared at the exami-
nation to try for four vacant places
on the Club, and last fall tliiltys
two tiied for the ﬁve vaczinci ..
And the work which the Glee
Club is doing torthe college seems

 

tuwarrantthrsgrowingpopniarrty.
During the ﬁrst year, it appeared
only once in public, in the concert
given May r7 with the Ampllion
Olchesti‘rt. ill which btltli otgatliy
ations made their initial appeals
ance before a home audience and
created it decidedly favorable im-
prea ion. Last year, in ctrnjlincs
tion with the Orchestra, they gave
twelve collceits Elllcl thi cirson
prom to give them till mole
numerous engagements.

While we are justly proud of
both the achievements and Char-
acterofoui-various athletic teams,
it lies in the nature of things that
a Glee Club can better express the
various characteristic phases of
college life in songs and has more
opportunities for coming in pet‘s
sonal contact with the social and
home life of the people to whom
they sing; and it rnigirt be added
that Glee Club audiences, the
country over, are invariably Com-
posed of the best elements in the
Colllinunityijtist the element of
society, a favorable impression
upon whom would be of material
advantage to any college.

Now that par-t of a year has al»
r ady been spent on the work of
preparing a program. some esti-
mate ol the Club's work is possis
ble On the whole, the voices are
stronger and in better condition
than ever belore. Thisrs particu-
apparent among the tenors,
the basses remaining practically
the same as last year. The hard
est and tnost telling practice will,
however. be in the two months
following vacation. Among tlte
novelties for this year will be Mr,
Peck's song, ”Our College is our
Castle," which took the second
prize in lastyear's contest. Pros
re or Cole has composed some

strrring harnronres tor it. The
Club possesses a "yodler" this
year, and it is hoped that otrr last
yea s whistler, Mr. Harris. may
take some [)oﬁtgrnduate wot-h-
with the Club,

For the ﬁrst time in its history
an opportunity will be given for
comparing the merit of the Iowa
College Glee Club with those of
the great university glee clubs
The Princeton and Chic g0 Uni-
versrty clubs have already ap-

ctried in several cities in which
our Glee Club and Orchestra will
give concerts on their spring trrp.
May success [allow them in all
their undertakings.
