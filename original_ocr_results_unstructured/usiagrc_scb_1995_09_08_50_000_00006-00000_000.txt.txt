E largest college-owned house, 1205 Park, was in
high demand during room draw last year.
”Last year we had 5 applications tor 1205 Park,"
said Odo Callison, Grinnell’s director of housing.

Part of the reason why the house is so appealing to
groups is that it holds 14 people in mostly singles, and it
is right across the street tram ARH. The house is a
nonsmoking camp, with a double kitchen, a vax terminal
and a TV/VCR.

"Most of the residents are either science maiors,
people who lived in Loose last year, or both," said
sophomore resident Sarah Peterson, The group oftriends
that gathered to live in the house wanted a change from
typical dorm lite.

”Part atthereasonto live off campus is to create your
own home environment, rather than Iivi g in whatever
environment is created for you on campus,” said sopho-
more Collis Rost. ”One of the things that we all have in
common is that we all like smoke-free living. We’re all
people who were generally friends with each other."

dents were somewhat per-
plexed. "Laundry is the only
thing that I miss. Really, there
are no other big problems he»
sides our accessibility to laun»
dry. Our house is closer than
any dorm to ARH,” comment-
ed sophomore Lissa Mock.

The house, which has three
iuniors, fourseniors, and seven
sophomores, requires residents
to eat less than ten meals per
week at the dining hall. Most
otthe house membersseemed
morethan happy to comply. "I
like people and I like cooking,”
said Mack. ”Lastweekl cooked
and cleaned. Its a big change
from Younker pit,"

Rost concluded, ”This year
was my choice. Its largely about
choice andthefactthatlactual-
Iy have people around me who
cook."

NO GERMAN BEER THIS YEAR AT
PINK ELAMINOO HOUSE

by SARAH STAVETEIG

Features Editor
T's usually called Ex-German house or Room Draw
House, but ﬁnally, the residents at 1019 Park Street
hopetochangetheir nameta something more unique:
Pink Flamingo House.

”Or more generically, Lawn Ornament House," said
senior Aaron Gross. ”Come December, it will be all the
rage in Grinnell."

The new thematic undertaking for house residents
may be a little bit expensive, (have you seen the prices tor
lawn ornaments these days?) butstill cheaperthantrying
to live up to a name such as 'German Beer House.’

That title was among others residents chose their
new theme from. Some alternatives included: 'Grinnell
House ll- the legend continues,‘ and ’Bob, the house at
lun.’

When the German theme was cancelled last year,

people drew into the house without knowing
each other, much like a dorm floor. The house,
in tact, is college»owned, so residents have a
cozy house atmosphere with some of the perks
of a college dorm, The common house areas,
are cleaned, torexample, and lawn care is done
by Facilities Management.

Gross, who had a pretty good roam draw
number lastyear, chosethe house because "the
vegan food in the dining halls is terrible." He is
completely off board and cooks all of his meals
inthehouse. Thisisthethird yearGross haslived in a house
and opted to not be on the board plan.

Sophomore roommates Elizabeth Mackey and Susan
Regen had very high numbers at room draw lastyear. ”We
had to choose between this house and Norris,” said
Mackey, Now that she's there, however, ”I like the kitchen

Rogen added, ”the individual bathrooms are the best.

The three residents seemed to agree that living in
college-owned housing was betterthan living in the dorms,
and that they didn’t feel very removed from campus.
