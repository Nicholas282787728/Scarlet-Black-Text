URTNG the last few days there
has heen a remarkable display
of college enthusrasm. The unpre-
cedentezl attendance at the State Meet
indicates the interest which this con-
test arouses. orcourse a large part of
this interest is due to the fact that
Grinnell’s prospects (on winning are
exceedingly good and under such clr-
cumstznnes people are easily enthused.
The train goes to Des Moiues today
backed by a large delegation and
knowng that their eﬂorts will be up
preclnted. However. it is Well to re-
member that Grinnell may not win.
\Vin or loose, let us remember that
the Grilinoll men will do their best
and on that account, if for no other,
deserve all the credit which they may
receive.
