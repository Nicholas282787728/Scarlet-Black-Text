HE question has arisen in
m the minds of some as to
whether the circulation at the
[rm/rt College lertLtzrrr among
the Alumni does not adveisely-
attect theAlumni subscriptions to
SCARLET AND BLACK, and in re»
sponse to tllis a negative answer
has been received, coupled with
the assertion that Seance-r AND
BLACK receives very little support
from the Alumni outside of (Erin
nell, With I'egzirdto the effect of
the [VewS-Lllllr, we ale not pre
pared to answer. except in this
way, that the Alumni subscrip-
tions this year exceed those at
last year. But with regard to the
answer to this question given
above, we wish to state again, with
additional emphasis. ivliat ape
peared in this column ashort time
ago, namely, that the chief sup
port of the college paper is the
support of the Alumni outside oi
Grinnell. This was no idle state-
mentmadetrom purely mercenary
motives, but a statement of fact.
and as such can easily be veriﬁed.
The proportion between the sup-
port of the Alumni outside of
Grinnell and the local support,
including students, faculty, alumr
ni and townspeople is about three

to two.
ECRET practice has been
established at the State
University on all days except Fri-
day. This rule has been ‘made
necessary because of the unsym-
pathetic attitudc of some of the
spectators. In nearly all institun
tions there are some disloyal slur
dents ivho seemingly have no re
gard tor the ieelings ot the plays
ers. or interest in their success.
it is to be regretted that the great
body of students who are their

ougllly interested in the woik of
the team sllould be denied the
privilege of showing their inteiest
by their presence at the practice
because of the actions ota few
students who delight in jeel'lng at
the men. it is a source of satiSr
faction that nothing of this nature
has occurred on our own ﬁeld.
The students seem to realize‘that
the team needs every encourage~
merit, and although each evening
there’is a good sized crowd at the
practice, nothing to interfere with

the work has been done,

The point in this is so very evi-

WALTER W. Davis,

There is apparently some mlS'
understanding regarding the no-
tice concerning lust, iorsale or

of a private nature and conse-
quently are placed in the paid
local add column at ﬁve cents a
