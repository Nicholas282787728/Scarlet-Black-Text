30 Minutes More

Grinnell college women will have an opportunity Monday
to vote for an adult minute system developed by League
Board. In simplification, the plan is to allow each girl
30 minutes a semester to take care of unavoidable lateness.

It is obvious that watches are not always synchronized
witll the Main hall clock, that problems do occur on the way
lhome from a date, and that it is quite easy to reach tlle
quad a few minutes after closing hours. Two or more nights
in study hall have been a high price for such misfortunes.

But Monday, qlladites have an opportunity to correct
that stiff penalty, at least on a trial basis. They have an
opportunity to be dealt witll iii an adult manner: Tile vote
should be unanimous in accepting the new plan for next
semester,

Is Everybody Happy?

After it was made known last week that the Student
Council was investigating the cause for the high transfer
rate from Grinnell this semester, tllere were wild rumors
concerning the number leaving. Estimates ranged from 50
to 100 students and talk in the dorms concerned their slip-
posed reasons for transferring.

It would seem the estimates have been too high, how-
ever. A current report from the dean’s office shows that at
the most, 28 studentsullot including the 17 who will gradu—
ate, are leaving the college at the end of the semester. This
is not an unusually high number. ‘

The fact remains, however, that a feeling of discontent
is noticable on the campus. This does not seem to be the
usual griping, but a deeper unhappiness which is dangerous
for any group.

Somerattribute the discontent to a.lack of available
courses, to teachers who are bored with teaching, to im-
maturity of the students, to a lack of dating, to a feeling
of not belonging. L

It is difficult to analyze such a situation. Why the dis-
content? Is it the old “grass is greener on the other side”
business? Are friends at SUI elaborating on the great
parties they‘re having? Are B courses simply a rehash of
high school classes? Are teachers getting the eighteenth
century Oxford professors‘ habit of worrying only about
their wages? Are the women overly concerned about the
lack of dating?

The Student Council is tr ing to find the answer to
these problems. They have distributed questionaires to
students who areythinking of leaving Grinnelll Through
the answers, they hope to discover reasons for the discon-
tent and make an attempt to correct them. We can only hope
they will be successfull The feeling which is now pervad-
ing the school is not one for healthy living

Dear sirs:

SCARLET AND BLACK

Yes or No?

By a unanimous vote of all the schools in the Midwest
conference, Beloit’s student government was recently ousted
from the conference student government association on a
temporary basis.

The action was supposedly to help get Beloit back in the
athletic conference: Thoughts of the delegates were these:
all the representatives should run home and ‘ask their admin-
istrations why Beloit was expelled athletically. The Beloit
student government should also try to see why they were
expelled. Then if they had tried to redeem themselves by
the spring conference, they would be readmitted to the
student government association, Suspending Beloit from
the association is supposed to impress the Beloit administra-
tion with the gravity of their athletic situation.

Nonsensical though the action may seelii to us, it
brought about a situation which we feel should be remedied.

The two Grinnell delegates went to the Conference with
no knowledge of thelfeelings of the Grinnell Student Council
concerning the Beloit affair. Yet they voted for Beloit’s exv
pulsion and that vote went down as a Vote of Grinnell, Other
students have gone to conferences, usually conferences in
which they are .especially interested, and have voted as rep-
resentatives of the college, There is nothing in the Student
Council constitution which gives them that powerl

The S&B advocates a definite clause in the constitution
which would cover such situations We suggest that any
action taken at conferences in the name of Grinnell college
should be valid as representing the opinion of the council.
However, the council should reserve the right to veto such
decisions if they prove to be undesirable when brought back
before the group.

In response to your editorial
of last week’s issue “In This
Corner . . I am happy and
proud to say that such a pros
feet as was carried out by the
‘YWCA freshman committee fnur
years ago is now underway,

The national service fraternity
of our college realized the need,
for a used book sale and tradr
ing center quite some time ago,
so a commlttee was formed to
carry out this needed service to
the College,

We plan to hold our sale and
exchange in the student union
Jan. 31, and Feb. 1, 2, 4 and 5.
We feel that lhis service pro-
ject will be a help to students
who wish to sell old textbooks
and also those who wish to buy
used textbooks, Everyone should
profit We ask only the coopera-
tion of our fellow students in
this undertaking,

I thank you,

'Rub

- Don't
— Blol

I wrote a column all about ‘
pinning once and tossed it in
the ash can because of personal
commitments. Someone else can
do the tossing this time.

There‘s not too much wrong
with pinning. It’s the pins that
ought to be done away with. It’s
too easy to get a pin at Grin—
nell. Every male student auto-
malically wins the right to buy
a pin and thereby stick it on
some girl's chest.

by Bruce Cole

It doesn’t mean “I love you”
It only means that Someone is

too lazy or scared to go through
the ceremony bi calling up for
a date and possibly getting
turned down.

Pinning can’t mean anything
else because the pin doesn’t
mean anything. You can buy
them by the gross and if you
know 144 girls you can get rid
of them just as fast. Hall pins
are just another way in which
we ape the habits of the frater-
nity system at large universities.

Hardly o soul on this c‘ampus
will admit being in favor of the
fraternity system, as such. Yet,
prepping is simply a watered
down form of pledging except
that you can't get blackballed
hers,

Hall parties are just like
fraternity parties; they're not
even wateredldown. The pins we
wear and hand out look like
frat pins at twenty paces.

The similarities and there.
Hall pins are chesp and easy to
get and the institution of pin-
ning is beginning to take on
the same character. >-

The inmates of south campus
are afraid to face their friends
and families as home without
some kind bi jewelry hanging
from thell' cashmeres.

And that can't even match the
fear of being without a pin on
the campus. If anyone can give
,pinning any real significance
lit’s the girls, but they haven‘t
because they’re too insecure to
say “no,"

rhcl-s are several couples on
,ihis campus who feel a sincere
affection for one another but
fwlio don‘t dare get pinned bee
lcause it has come to denote im—
‘maturiiy rather than sincerity,
; Maybe if pins were awarded
,only to 'juniors and seniOis
they’d mean a little more. May
;bc a twenty dsllar border of
:pcsrls mlglll make them im-
portant, if only for their value.
Maybe the ladies should have
lhal1 pins of their own, like
’soi-orities, so that they wouldn’t
lfeel naked, unadorned by s brass
horseshoe or a goldfilled sundial.

If the girls haven‘t got the

sense to stop all these meanings
less pinnings and restore the
lold practice of dating, they de-
,serve to sit home weekends as
lso many do; ‘
l It’s up to one of the more in-
liluenilal men’s groups to start
lehanging some of the rules.
:0therwise, we may as well save
our cash and go back to high
school class rings and knotted
‘strands oi dime Store pearls.
