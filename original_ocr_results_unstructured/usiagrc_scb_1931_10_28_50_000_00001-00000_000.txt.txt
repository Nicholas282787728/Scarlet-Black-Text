Both Teams Will Resort

to Passing Attack

in Game Here

(sat to The Scarlet and Block)

NORTHFIELDiAfter week of
drilling on defense, and a short week
end rest, the Carleton football squad
settled down this week to perfecting
its attack in preparation for the
Crinnell game Friday night at Grinr
nell.

After a stiff scrimmage Friday,
the varsity watched the freshman
team trounce st. Olaf’s yearlings. In
spite of rainy weather, scrimmage
was again held Monday and Tues—
day. Thursday the squad leaves for
Marshalltown, where the men will
get their first taste of night prac-
tice under the junior college's floode
lights. The Carls will move lo,Gl'in-
nell Friday afternoon.

No Hospital List

The entire squad is now in good
shape, and barring the i 'ury to Matt
Thoeny which caused him to turn in
his suit for the season, every man
w . likely be on deck when the game
with the Pioneers opens. The coach-
ing staff is knocking on wood em-
phatically this weelr with no hospital
list.

The Carls are not being misled by
the defeat of Grinnell last week at
St. Louis. but fear the Pioneer pass-
ing attack, and are building a de—
fense to stop the aerial bombard-
ment. 0n the other hand, the Carls
are sure to Show some nifty passing
on their own book, and experts look
for a battle of forward passing
elevcns.

Tlonsililis Puts
Rose in Hospital

bringing Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt's

Those now nursing injuries are Galz,
end; Trumbull, guard; Ullrich, half-
back, and Rose. fullback.

Fritz Craflund, veteran back, re
turned to the lineup for good yester—
day, however, after gracing the
bench the major part of the last
three weeks with a wrenched back.

The squad went through a dreary

practice session Monday and yester-

whether he had prevented it or not.
He was opposed to the match.

Miss Williams met Mr. Vesotsky
while attending Vassar last year. She
was 21 years old Friday and left

hardship for somc Grim-loll college
students.

meeting of the student council and

Cf two professors on the campus
who play the piano by ear. one, Cecil
F. Lavell, professor of history of
thought, has never had a music les-
son. The other, Chester Williams, has
studied music extensively and is an
instructor in the Crinncll music de-
partment The methods of these two
men are as different as one would
expect them to be under such circum.
stances.

Mr. Lavell says. “How do I play
the piano when I have never had any
lessons? Anyone can do it if he can
whistle to tune. Besides, I did have a
lesson once. When I was about six
years old I was taught to play the
air of 'By-O~Baby’ with one finger
of my right hand and the bass with
one finger of my left hand.

The limits of my playing are very
small, for I do not have a particular-
1y good car. I can play only what I
can whistle.

“The whole secret is in the ingen-
ious arrangement of the piano that
provides black keys sticking out from
the white ones in groups of three and
two. The white keys I can't tell
apart, and I don’t see how anyone

 

Anyone Able to Whistle Can Learn ,
to Play Piano, Says Cecil F. Lavell

can. But when I try out. a tune on
the black keys to my right I know
where I am, and the bass is easy to
find on similar black keys to the left.
In exploring thus for agreeable hare
monies, sometimes the result isn't so
bad.

“That's clear, don’t you think? It
is all in using the black keys, See?"

In regard to the same subject Mr.
Williams says, “I don't think 1 play
by ear. To me, a per-son who plays
by ear is one who cannot read music
at all, and who has a certain method
or formula for playing as he does.

“For instruments I play, I read
music for everything but dance
pieces. In order to play such pieces
on the piano, I must first hear the
tune. Having this well in mind. I
then figure out notes for the bass
and chords for the melody according
to the theories of harmony.

“I suppose. generally speaking,
that this is really playing by car, as
most pcople who do such must bear
the tune first and then play it ac»
cording to their own methods as I
do. However, most of them would
not apply the technical theories.”
