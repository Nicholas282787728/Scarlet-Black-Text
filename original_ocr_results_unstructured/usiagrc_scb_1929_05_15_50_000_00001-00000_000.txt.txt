'and Saturday here and an undefeated
'track team performs against the Cap-
ital‘city here Saturday,

This is the first season that. Drake
and Grinnell have had baseball teams
since 1913. The Pioneer team is be-
ing chosen today on the‘ basis uf per-
formances in the intramural league
and the Bulldog team, which is al-
ready organized, played an extensive
but successful schedule.

step Tommi Varsity Card

The ganies this week will be the
first steps toward a baseball team
from Grinnell for inter-collegiate
Competition..,l. C. Truesdale, director
of athletics, indicated yesterday. If
inter-est is aroused, it seems likely
that a heavy schedule will he Carded
next year, he stated.

As in other sports, freshmen will
not be eligible for competition but
will have a nine of their own which
may compete with the varsity.

iGrinnell Runners
Unbeaten in Duals

A‘ Coach Lester Dub '5 warriors of

the cinder path will go into the fray
here Saturday for a second time this
year against Drake. To pick the win-
ner in advance is difficult, but, with
a spotless record of duals this year,
'the Pioneers are out for a victory.
Duke promises that at the very
least it will be a nip and tuck affair,
and, in shaping the dope the Pioneers
can scarcely be elbowed out of the
picture.
Field Events to Decide
Crlnnell defeated Drake by six
points in the indoor meet between the
two institutions and the outdoor ses-
sion should be comparatively as
close. 0n the pathway, Gordon has
the iso practically clinched for Drake
and Parks will probably carry the
sprints. McKee, Taylor, Hensley,
Mark and Pelletier. will probably
give Grinnell some points in the
quarter mile, hurdles and mlle relay,
however, and as has been the case in
all of this year’s meets, it will he up
to the field events to decide.
Depends- 0n Kukolich
The high jump will probably be
hotly contested since Drake boasts a
pair of live feet eleven inch leapers
and Douglas and McCulIy hit that
mark themselves. Kukolich, looks
like a shining hope for Grinnell in
the field. He has been improving
steadily since the start of the season,
bettering his discus mark by in feet
over that in his early attempts of the
spring. Douglas, who competes in
most of the field, bettercd his own
broad jump mode at Creighton when
he went 22 feet 2 inches and he may
be able to account for some real dis-
tance in that line Saturday.
Duke Wants med
The meet will start promptly at 2
p. m. Friday and will be run on
schedule, closing before 4 o'clock.
Coach Duke is anxious that an espec-
ially large crowd of students come
out for the meet since Grinnell's track
team is one of the outstanding squads
,ln the Missouri Valley this year and

deserves suplﬁrt
