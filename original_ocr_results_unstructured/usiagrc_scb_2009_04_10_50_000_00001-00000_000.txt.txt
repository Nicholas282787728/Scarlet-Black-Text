No Limits speaks,
SGA responds,
questions remain

BY CHLoE MonL

During the Wednesday, April 8 Joint
Board meeting. the studenttled group the
No Limits Project presented to members
of SGA their list of demands addressed
to President of the college Russell K.
Osgood and members of the administra-
tion. By the end, both parties had more
information, but many more questions to
ask and to have answered.

The No Limits presentation, last-
ing past its allotted hour, addressed is-
sues such as hate crime policy creation,
needtblind aid for international students,
staffing and funding of the Community
Service Center, among others.

“Because of time limits. it was kind
of strained because we do budgets and
the presentation was going on and the
question and answer was going back and
forth." said SGA President Nco Motakc
09. “But for them to address the send»
tors and SGA cabinet, [Joint Board] was
A good place for them to address us."

East campus senator Holden Bale
'12, an active participant in the question
and answer portion of Joint Board, said
he was pleased with the dialogue that
occurred, but still expressed disappoint-
ment that a conversation between SGA

Same- -sex marriage legalized in Iowa

5‘] DAVID LOGAN

On Friday, April 3, the Iowa Supreme court ruled that Iowa's
marriage lawiwhich provided only for heterosexual mar-ringer
violated the state constitutions equal protection clause, effectively
paving the way for sametsex couples in the state to wed.

The decision upheld a 2007 district court tailing in a case that
pitted the Polk County Registrar against six samecsex couples
who claimed that Iowa Code section 595.2 was unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court ruled that the county's atylments in
favor of the banithat it promoted procreation and encouraged
stability in oppositetsex relationships, among other arguments—
were either not ﬂirthered by the law or did not constitute a suf-
ﬁcient government interest. That the law’s distinction based on
sexual orientation did not substantially further a governmental
interest made the law unconstitutional.

“Equal protection under the Iowa Constitution is essentially
a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated
alike," the Court wrote. “Since territorial times, Iowa has given
meaning to this constitutional provision. striking blows to slav-
ery and segregation, and recognizing women's rightsThe court
found the issue ofsametsex marriage comes to it with the same
importance as the landmark cases of the past.”

Alcohol task force

ill/JEFF RADERSTRDNG

Earlier this semester, President Russell K. Osgood announced
the creation of an Alcohol Task Force to review the College's alcOt
hol policy. Mandated by federal law every two years, this semester’s
review of the alcohol policy is the ﬁrst to be done by a committee,
about halrofwhich is made up ofstudents. In the past, Senior Re
search Associate for Diversity and Achievement Jcn Ktohn cont
ducted the review when she was the Dean of Student Life.

The committee will open for input from students, faculty, staff
and community members'rhey will be holding a towndrall srylc
meeting to discuss the alcohol culture at Grinnell next Wednesday
April 14, 7:30 p.m., tentatively scheduled in Loosc Lounge,

The Court’s decision invited considerable national attention
as indicated, in part, by the more than 40 parties which filed amie‘i
curiae briefs in the case.

The response on campus was overwhelmingly positive, The
onlinc cyber forum GrinnellPlans was flooded with posts extol
ling the Court’s decision and expressing pride at living in Iowa.

“1 think it's cool to have it happen in a state where I’m curt
rcntly living,” said Jon Richardson '10, a corLeadet of the Stone
wall Coalition. Following the decision, Richardson and friends
ventured across campus with pride flags on full display. “As a gay
person, any time you have your rights validated or the governt
ment vindicate what you have believed for a long time, it’s a very
exciting thing, so that was really great."

The decision in low, which made it the third state in the
country to allow same-sex marriages, was quickly followed by a
similar event in Vermont. On Tuesday, April 7, the Vermont state
legislature overrode a gubernatorial veto that struck down a law
allowing for same-sex marriages.

The Vermont law was signiﬁcant in that it was the ﬁrst all
lowance of same-sex marriages at the hands ofa legislature int
stead ofa court. Court decisions have at times been criticized as
undemocratic. Following the week’s events in Iowa and Vermont,

there are now four states in which same sex couples can wed,
the other two are Massachusetts and Connecticut.

The Iowa case is likely to have far—reaching implications be-
yond its immediate impact of allowing same-sex marriages. in
its opinion, the Court ruled that legal classifications based on
sexual orientation constituted a “suspect classiﬁcation,” in part
because of the history of“invidious discrimination" against gay
and lesbian people and the group’s comparatively limited po~
litical clout. Suspect classifications are generally subject to more
stringent judicial review meaning that all future laws employing
distinctions on the basis of sexual orientation will be less likely
to pass muster.

The intermediate level of scrutiny applied by the court was
the same typically used for gender distinctions. According to
Hamrd Law Professor Martha Field, the U.S. Supreme Court
has thus far examined di inctions of sexual orientation only
at the lowest levels of scrutiny which make it more difﬁcult to
overturn government decisions.

The opinion could also pave the way for similar decisions in
other states asjustices outside Iowa look to the decision for both
legal guidance and political legitimacy.

attempts to promote clear message

A follow up open forum wﬂl be scheduled after the first town—
hall meeting to discuss rhe specifics of garments alcohol policy.

The Task Force, created in compliance with the Dmg—Fiec
Schools and Communities Act, has no power to change any of the
school’s policies. but will only make rccommendations to Osgood
at the semester's end based on their discussions and findings.

Task Force members say these recommendations will not

amount to an ovcrhanl of the policy, but will likely be centered on
increased education.

The announcement ofthc review came causing some students
to be wary of rhc intentions of the Task Force, raising concerns
about the real purpose orthe group.
