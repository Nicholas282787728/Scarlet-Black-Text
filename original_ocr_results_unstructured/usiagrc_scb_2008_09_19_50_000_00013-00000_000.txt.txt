No longer just a gaping hole in the
earth, Phase II of the Athletics and Fitness
center is beginning to take shape. Due to
careful, adaptive planning and a flourish
of activity during the summer, construc»
tion ofthe 275, 000- -square- -foot facility has
progressed as scheduled once completed,
the field house and natatorium will provide
the college with an Indoor track. four new
tennis courts, and an upgraded pool, among
other amenities.

Accolding to Vice President tor institu-
tional Planning Marci Soitor, Phase II is
right on pace for its scheduled suinmei 2010
completion. “For the excavation, we are on
timc...Thcre is this constant push to keep
things on track," Sorter said. “We did a
number of things in the slimmer of 2007...
just so we would be ready to go as soon as
we were
given the
g t e c n
light."

employed techniques enabling them to con,
tinue working in a wet environment. By
over excavating and laying a bed of gravel,
the crew has becn mostly able to prevent ad-
versc puddles and muddy conditions.

Although there was a short setback in
the project when sustained rain caused “the
walls to fall in,” Sortor said the construct
tion crew has been able to makc up time.
“They were working weekends, sometimes
even on Sundays, often starting at 6 a.m."

The most notable progress so far is the
construction and covering of the link be
tween Phases I and Il. Phase I. of course,
was the construction of the current athletic
and fitness center that holds Darby gym.

tare progress over the winter.

But the progress hasn't been without
inconvenience. Because the construction
blocks most access routes to the football
field, spectators will not be able to access
the bleachers through traditional means.

"Fans will follow a woodchip pathway
next to [the current Fitness Center],” said
Athletic Director Greg Wallace. “They
will travel down a newlysconstructed set of
stairs to field level." From there, the woods
chip trail will continue around the end zone
to the home side bleachers.

After teaching the bleachers, fans will
find themselves with less space in which to
cheer on the Pioneers. Because the scope
of the construction extends to the eastern
edge of the field, the visitor stands had to
be removed. As a result Grinnell “will sec-
tion off the north end oftlie present bleaclin

Wallace said.

question marks heading into the season,”

But those question marks have been ans

on continuing the winning tradition. “I
couldn't be more pleased at the way our first
years and returning players have stepped up
