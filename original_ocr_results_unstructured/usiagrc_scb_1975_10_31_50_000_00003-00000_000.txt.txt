E'he
musician
Rahsaan

by Danllexter

What would you say to a blind
nth wearing anywhere irom one
to five Wind instruments and
another half-dozen African per-
cussion instruments, who has just
. shed a rap about a woman who
makes love to a computer?
Rahsaan Roland Kirk is such a
man, and Saturday night in

herts Theatre we will all have

chance to hear, see, and ieel
the aforementioned facts.

It is perhaps as much of an art to
listen to Roland Kirk as it is for
Roland Kirk to give a concert. His
words and music give so much to
think about, i hesitate to put him
singley in the role of a musician.
But a musician heis, and a fine one
at that. His flute ballads on such

leases as Bright Moments

combine a Latin type percussion

with the Kirk type oi improvisation
and are enchanced by his
amazingly complete control at
soprano, also, and tenor
saxophones, the stritch. the nose
ilute, and of course, acoustic ilute.
Between his sets, I've heard him
rﬁtlte poetry which combines, in
i accents the music he plays. To
It this concert would be a sin.
His latest release, entitled “The
Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio
tailor,” has many iine cuts on it,
or» g them a version or Scott
lln’s The Entertainer, On
Portrait of those Beautiful Ladies.
Kirk oiicrs some line (lute melodic
lincs in a chord structure
reminiscent of a Sonny Rollins
tune. With him on this album is
Cornell Dupree on Guitar, Richard
Tee on the keys, Lawrence Killian
on Congos, and Ralph MacDonald
on percussion, along with a iew
other sidemen. A fine version of the
DixonrHenderson tune “Bye Bye
_ bird” is found on side three,
with a 53 second cut entitled
“Conversation,” that should catch

~than just your ears. ,
$1 'ain’t say much more about the

a bum, for 1 could not represent
Kirk’s music in words. The concert
this Saturday should be quite
enough to let you know where the
iwn is at musically and
spiritually. See you there,

andidates go courting

by Kathy Kramer

My political spirit led me to
Ames, Iowa last Saturday to
witness the kickoff of the 1976
Democratic Presidential race.
Seven declared candidatesiBayh,
Carter, Harris, Jackson, Sanford,
Shriver, and UdallAscrambled [or
votes in their brief ten minute
addresses to the convention. The
crowd played lowa politics while
the nation watched the iirst step In
lhe narrowing-down-the-
candidates game.

i was reminded oi my high
school days, when a friend.
unknown to the student body at
large (unpopular in H.s. terms)
faced a race with six other can-
didates with similar opinions and
solutions to school problems. The
method she used to distinguish
herself was to give “special at»
tention" to the freshmen, athletes,
and the AP class members,

In limes, all the candidates gave
“special attention" to racial
equality, aide to tarmers. and tot
importance to this column) equal
rights for women. It is pleasing to
be in a group that is promised
special attention, but since
everyone sees us as significant.

equal rights? I will allow the
reader to judge by presenting
select quotes oi the speakers.

George McGovern (the Keynote
speaker . not a candidate) wove
feminism into his address
naturally. Along with using such
words as “chairperson" and
“congresswpman,” George ape
pealed to our morality when
dealing with oppression oi select
groups by simply stating, “All men
are brothers and all women are
sistersl”

Terry Saniord adopted a more
belligerent approach. He vowed
that all humans should work for the
equal rights oi each other and
concluded his statement with,
“And yes. 1 consider myseli a
feminist,”

Birch Bayh, well-known as a
sponsor and the Senate ﬂoor
manager of the ERA, felt come
fortable with women's issues since
his words are backed by actions.
He thanked iowa ior passing the
ERA and congratulated the
citizens ior standing up ior equal
rights. .

Jimmy Carter said nothing about
women and nothing about equality
