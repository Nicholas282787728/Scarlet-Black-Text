Culver visits campus for first time since 2008

BYSOLOMONMILLEK

Governor of Iowa Chet Culver came to
JRC 209 yesterday to speak to students and
members of the Poweshiek County commu-
nity as part of his campaign for re-election.

The “Coffee with the Governor” was orga-
nized by the Iowa Democratic Party’s Coordr
nated Campaign, which promotes all DemOs
crats up for election who worked with Culver’s
campaign and the Grinnell Campus Demo-
crats. Culver is campaigning on the premise
that his administration handled problems like
the economic downturn and the devastating
ﬂoods, saving the state from greater impacts.

“We've made some difﬁcult decisions, but
because we did.,.we’ll be able to get our state
back on track and back to being vibrant," Cul-
ver said,

Culver arrived an hour laleiat 5:15 ins
stead of his scheduled 4:15, About 15 of the
40 people who showed up initially left before
he arrived, though among those who stayed he
was generally well—received,

Culver came as part of statewide tour or
various schools, He was late because he hitd
been in Iowa City speaking at the University
of Iowa and signing two bills, having signed
one in Des Monies earlier in the morning, he
said.

Elizabeth Rennick ’11, coaleader of the

Campus Democrats, is glad Culver came to
the College.

“Grinnell College in particular is a really
important part of the community here, and
Grinnell students have typically...had a high
voter turnout and are pretty liberal,” Rennick
said.

Culver's last visited Grinnell in 2008,when
he campaigned for President Baracls Obama

Rennick introduced Culver to the crowd,
sayin “Chet Culver and [Lieutenant Gov-
ernor Patti Judge have managed our state
responsibly, efﬁciently and compassionatcly,
without using budget gimmicks and with an
eye to our future.The result has been a strong
business climate and one of the fastest grow-
ing economies of any state. "

In his speech, Culver expanded on his
claim of a successful governorship by citing
a Forbes article published WednesdayY which
called Des Moines the “Best Place for Busi-
ness and Careers"ln the country.

Iowa has the 8th fastest growing economy
of any state and is now one of seven states
with an AAA bond ratingilhe highest level,
which helps the Iowa government loan mon-
ey—according to Culver.

Culver took questions from students, in—
cluding one from Kevin Svendsen ’10, from
Marshalltown, Iowa. about affordable college

education.

“Raising tuition while correspondingly
raising financial aid helps people who can’t aft
ford it by people who can afford it paying a
little bit more,"Svendsen proposed.

Culver responded by recalling a new grant
program he had started and saying he was
dedicated to making education affordable.

“I would always hope for more commit-
ment," Svendsen said, acknowledging that it is
early in the campaign season.

Svendsen, a Republican, is not sure who he
will support in the general election next fall.
“I'm not particularly supportive of the people
who have been talked about [to run as a Re-
publican against Culverl," svendsen said,“but
we’ll see who‘s picked."

Ellie ShookY Poweshiek County Supervi-
sor, Democrat and a Culver supporter, made
sure to tell Culver about a policy she does not
support.

“I really want to urge him to consider raise
ing the fuel tat," Snook said, “The people who
are using the roads will be the ones paying for
it.”

By raising the fuel tat, Iowa could atrord to
better repair roads and bridges across the state,
according to Shook.

Pride week
makes another
appearance

Bv CAROLIN SCHOLZ

Last Friday's Drag Show waltzcd the campus
into this years Pride wceit celebration.

organized by the Trans Action Group
(TAG), Stonewall Coalition (StoncColr Queer
People ofColor (QPOC) and other organizations,
Pride wccic an annual Grinncll tradition, began
with last Friday Flag Raising Ceremony behind
Herrick Chapel.

Margie Scribner '10 YJon Richardson '10 and
Ryan Carlino '10 serve as the leaders of Pride
Week.

Countless students have been involved,
whether by simply adding their handprint to the
will in the Stonewall Resource Center or attend
ing the Kei‘note Address by spoken word poctJtr
lia Scrano on l‘cmiuism and transcmality. Among
the new events introduced this year, there is even
one dint reaches into the area of Admissions.

“\Vc have a PopsiclcsocProspics event on l-‘rr
day this veal," Scribner said, “it is meant as a wav to
rtach out to prospective students and promote the
stoncwall Resource ccntcr (SRC) on campus,"
Activiti are not limited to campus-wide events,
but also include participating in nation-nidc ac-
tions

“This Frldilv we are also participating in the
“Dav oi'Sllencc‘ to raise awareness for communis
ties that are silenced bemusc of their gender or
sexual identity," scribncr said. The Day of Silence
IS a nation-wide Ci'cnt on which students opt to
remain silence all-clay to represent the silencing of
LGBT coinmllnities.

However, some of the successful events of
years past could not be implemented this year

“We are not having a qiecr Music Festival
this year," Ridaardson said. “There were solne
other evmts I would have liked to see, but there
was no time.”

Pride week would probably not be possible if
it had not been for a generous donation by Gilda
Frantz in memory of her son Carl Frantz’79 who
was an active member of the gay community in
1970s. Organizers cstimatrd that the Week will
cost around £3,000 in total.

“We're fortunate to have the resources and ins
sljmtional support that Frantz was never able to
have.“ Scribner said. “During Franrz'tt time there
really wasn’t a queer community."

“Without her donation Pride Week
would have been impossible,” Scribner said.
”We are also supported by a lot ofdiarerent people
on campus; by faculty, stair and administrators."
It is in fact this support that draws more people to
take part in Pride Week

“I think it is really important to be a good ally,
to show support and participate in diese evens,
even ifyou are not necessarily part of the commu~
nity,"Adam Lange '11 said.

According to organizers, this year’s participa
tion seems to have been greater than usual. “We
had more people participating in, for atample the
ﬂag raising ceremony," Scribner said, which kicked
off the week by raising a Pride ﬂag alongside the
American ﬂag outside ofHerrick Chapel,

While the participauon in Pride Week events
this year grew from last year, Scribner tech next
year there should be more events relating to the
history ofqueemess at Grinnell.

"We don’t do a good job leaming the history
of queer students and queer student activism at
Grinnell," Scribner said. “It's important to know
where we've come from,"
