Captains:

Luther, Robinson
Named; Team May
Lose Slrykelr

By start Writer ,
Fred Luther, quarter miler and
hurdler, and Vern Robinson, pole
vaultcr, have been elected co-caps
tains of the Pioneer track squad
for next year.

Both men were consistent point
winners throughout the year and
showed gq-eat mpriovement in their
performances from week to week.

[They will succeed John Hayward

and Lynn Schlottcrbeck, who for
three years were one of the
highest scoring combinations‘in
the history of Grinnell track.
The two ex-oaptians and Bill
Sampson are the only graduating
lettermen lost to next year’s thin
claol squad. Their losses will be
a severe blow as it appears that
there are no new men who are
capable of nlng ther shoes.

It also appears that nii-ol
stryker, a very promising sopho-
more dash man, will be lost to
the team as he plans to matricu—
late to Michigan for law study.

Men who won letters in track
this past season. besides those
already mentioned, are Ted Appel-

campaign, has hecn launched by
the local Grinnell College Alumni
club, under the direction of Presi-
dent F. F. Clindimn, it was learn-
ed today.

The Fund is but one project of
the recently organized Grmnell
College Alumni council, an elective
body representing all graduates,
former students and othcr friends
of the college.

The general purpose of the coun-
cil is to organize and increase
the friendliness and co-opei-otion
of all Grinnell people and to
spread a clearer understanding of
the college and its work.

It is somewhat similar to the
“Dartmouth Plan" and is made
up of large numbers of compara-
tively small gifts. No pressure is
brought upon the donors. Each
person decides the amount of his

own gift to thc fund.

As a matter of ﬁxed policy,
seniors are not being asked to
contrihute to the fund, but letters
have gone out to them, calling
ltheir attention to the nation-Wide
organization of Grinnell oluhs and
urging them to identify themselves
with the Grinnell alumni chapters.

The campaigning in the city of
Grinnell is well under way, ac-
cording to reports. The Alumni
ofﬁce has announced that since
the organization of the council,
with almost no direct solicitation,
general contributions to the fund
lhave passed the $40,000 mark.

l The council will meet during
\the present commencement period
|to complete preliminary plans for
