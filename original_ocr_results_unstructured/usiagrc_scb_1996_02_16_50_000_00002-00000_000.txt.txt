Students organize to fight anti-gay legislation

NEWS EDITOR

The Iowa Coalition for l‘lu—
man Rights originally formed in
the summerof1995 to coordinate
efforts against antigay and radi—
calrightmovements. SomeGrin~
nell students were there at the
beginning, and now, the Stone—
wall Coalition is planning to at—
tend an Iowa Coalition meeting
to combat specific legislation re—
cently proposed in the Iowa Cone
gress.

“We’re in the process oforga—
nizing a group of Grinnell Stu'
dents to make our opposition to
the [legislation] known." come
mentedEtinShoulberg‘97,Chair
of the Stonewall Coalition Aer
tiVism Committee. The students
of the Stonewall Coalition are
searching for transportation to
Iowa City on Saturday, February
24th for all students interested in
attending the meeting. At the
gathering, members ofThe Iowa
Coalition for Human Rights will
discuss primarily what activists
can do to respond to the current
antirgay proposals. “Furthermore.
we hope to use this [meeting] as a
means to gather ideas aboutwhat
we can do to prevent further legr
islation from being introduced and
passed,” Shoulberg added.

The pieces of legislation
whichwillbethecenterofdiscus—
sion were proposed by Iowa Rep.
Chuck Hurley; they target educa—
tion, public and college libraries
and sameegender marriages.
Mona Shaw, member ofthe Iowa
Coalition for Human Rights, de—
scribed the legislation as “tragic
for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and
trans communities” in a January
letter to friends and allies of the
Coalition.

Thefirstpieceofanti—gay leg—
islation is an amendment to the

Education Appropriations Bill,
and would “outlaw any activity,
text book, or curricula in state!
funded educational institutions
that portray the gay lifeestyle as a
positive alternative,” according
the Iowa Coalition.

Also under the Hurley
Amendments, all public and Cole
lege libraries Will be restricted
from providing minors with litei»
ature which portrays the gay life
styleasapositivealtemative. This
literature would be banned com«
pletely by elementary and see
ondary schools. As mentioncd in
the amendments, all programs
which attempt to prowde pOSlr
tive education in state institu—
tronsabouthomosexualitywould
be prohibited.

One program which would
be affected by the proposed legisr
lation involves the Stonewall
Speaker’s Coalition, chaired by
Marsha Strickland ‘96. The pm,
gram educates Iowa students,
teachers and administrators about
human rights issues. Strickland
believes that the amendment
would halt the progress the pro«
gramhas made and states“itwould
pretty much shut us down.”

“These bills thieaten the ed~
ucarion system ofoui' state. How
can students be provided a fair
education if their needs are not
met as individuals, if one large
aspect of human nature is ig»
noted?" commented Heckcrt.

l-lecltert recommends that
studentswhosharehis Views write
their Iowa legislators, regardless
ofwhetheror not they can attend
the meeting next Saturday. In
addition, students are encouraged
to contact and persuade sympa»
thetic teachers to write congress-
men in order to attest to the edur
cational merit ofhomosexual lit—
eratute,

Anotherproposal, which re
centlypasscdolowaI-IouseCome
mittee 18—0, would not recog/
nize any marriage which does
not correspond to Iowa’s mar—
riage laws, Although no state
currently permits the union of a
sameesex couple, the Iowa bill
would not recognize any such
union, even ifstates such as I‘Iar
waii eventually were to permit
tame—gender marriages.

since decision on the mat»
riage bill has receiitly been postr

poned until next Tuesday, mem»
bers of the Iowa Coalition are Opt
tiinistic that there is still time to
affect the vote in the House. Al—
though the Iowa Coalition will be
meeting next Saturday, after the
vote is scheduled to take place,
their agenda extends beyond the
immediate issue in the House, Part
of the meetings agenda includes
introducing lobbying tactics that
activistscanemployonLebbyDay,
scheduled to take place in Des
Moines in March, and increasing

funds to continue fighting what

Even ifcui-i-cnt effortsfail and
the etiri-cnr bills pass the Iowa
Congress, some are hopeful that
the bills will not be law in Iowa.
“[The legislation] will eventually
befoundunconstitutional,"spec—
ulates Heckert. Addressing the
Education Appropriations Bill.
specifically, Heckert concludes
that “[thc bill] would be a \‘iolar

College changes copyright policy

BRIAN WAGNER
STAFF WRITER

During this academic year,
ormneii College has revised irs
method of processing copyright
permission requests.

The office ofChatles Duke,
Dean of the College, released
the copyright policy on Novcnr
bet 1, 1995, which dictated the
ncw process for College commu—
nity members to receive permis'
sion “to reproduce, alter, or per—
form works that are protected by
copyright," The changc responds
to the requests made by faculty
to establish an upetoedate and
well organized systcm of obtain»
ing copyright permission. “I re—
alized the faculty needed more
support in handling copyright
permission,” explains Duke.

The mostimportantchange
is the introduction of the Copy—
right Clearance Center which
works with the College to ace
quire permissionfrom publishers
and process royalty payments.
The CCC simplifies the task of
obtaining permission because
faculty members can process all
their requests through one agency,
instead of several different agencies.

The revised policy also seeks
to better orgat ' the distribution
of course packe ., which are col—
lections of photocopied material
fromvarioussourccsforuse as text.
The use ofthese course packets has
greatly increased this semcsterfroin
the successful coordination of the
faculty secretaries, who obtain
copyright permission, and the
bookstore, ii-h ich sells the packets.
The price of the packets pays the
royalty fees on the reproduced
material.

The new piecesses outlined
in the policy did not seriously af—
feet the pre\'|0u5 methods until
the current spring semester and is
receiving mixed reviews from faCe
ulty and secretaries. “I thought it
ivorltedpretty well butnexttime it
will go smoother,” comments Duke
who recognizes the hectic intro»
duction of the new program.

Some problems arose because
the college changed the policy
during last semester. Many faculty
members were unfamiliar with the
CCC method were forced to learn
the system in a very short time.
This caused some frustration be
cause professors had to scramble to
acquire permission for reproduced

material they were already pre—
pared to use in their courses.

l-Ielcn Scott, Associate
Dean of the College, has been
coordinating the implementation
of the new process on campus,
and explains, “It makes a differ;
enceforfaculty who are planning
courses, because they need more
lead time." The CCC's response
to requests may take severalwceks,
and many faculty members did
not have enough time before the
semester began for their requests
to be processed. Professors are
stuck when the material is inter
gral to the class but they are not
yet authorized to use photocopies
or reproductions.

“I think it's been a fairly
frustrating process, because it's
new and time consuming,” adds
Scott. Some professors became
overwhelmed with the paperwork
and faculty secretaries have
stepped in to share the load.

Terri Phipps, secretary in
ARH, stays positive with the
change because she believes that
professors will plan their courses
earlier and more efficiently in or—
der to anticipate resources and
obtain early permission.
