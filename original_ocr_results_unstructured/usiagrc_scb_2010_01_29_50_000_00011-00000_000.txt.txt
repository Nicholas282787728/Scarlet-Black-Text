Swimming looks to finish

BYCHllls'roPHmJ/lxlvtow

Two weeks ago at the Gnnnell Invitational,
for thc ﬁrst time in six years, the Grinnell Mcn's
swimming team heat Luther College. on sat-
urday, they will be faced
with the diallenge of doing
it againithis lime in Lu-
ther’s pool.

Both the men’s and
womerts squads are pre
paring for their ﬁnal two
competitions before the
Midwest Conference
Championships in mid
February They will make
the trip to Coe College and
Luther, neither of which is
a conference opponent, for
dual meets today and to-
morrow, respectively The
two competitions wrll cap at? what Assistant

Coach Tim Hammond considers to be a re—.

markable season.

“This is deﬁnitely the best season we have
had since I have been here, the most dedicated
team," Hammond said. “In the past, we've had
very dedicated swimmers, but as a whole team
this is the most dedicated team we’ve had."

The Mad Dogs and Mad Ducks performed
at avconsistently high level all season, but the
men's win over Lutherwas especially fulfilling.

“That was a big deal for the men's team,"
Tom Lankiewicz ’12 said. “It was our big rival
and our last meet in [Obermiller Pool], so it was
good to take them down."

Gnnnell managed to sink the rival Norsemcn
by a hefty so points, and proceeded to make a
good showing at the Carleton Mirarlnvirational
the following week with the men's team taking
iirst place. Lanklcwicz owes the surge in energy

that overcame Luther to the swimmer’s recent ,

training trip to Florida over Winter Break.

“It was really good with team bonding,"
Larlkiewicz said. “Coming off of that, I feel like
we're more of a team. We‘ve got good energy
coming out of Florida and I think thats really
helped us in the past couple ofwceks."

Saturday's matchup against Luther proves
especially interesting for Hammond, a Grinnell

coming to Grinnell College. ,

“I'm not certain that I spoke it vocally when '
I first came here, but’l knew that Luther had
outrswam Grinnell for
many years whlle I was on
that team at Luther, and
I knew that I wanted to
help GrinneJl be the bet»
ter team,” Hammond said.
"[Head Swimming Coach
Erin Hurley] and 1 spoke
about not necessarily 0UP
swimming. Luther, but
about the training theywere
doing."

By focusing on imple
menting a more advanced
strength program over the
last three years, the Grirmell
coaching staff has built a team that regularly
competes with more traditional Division Ill jug
gemauts.

“People on the LuLher team, as well as their
coach, have pointed out that we look much
stronger," Hammond said.

The Mad Dogs will have to rely quite a bit
on their strength and conﬁdence to take down
Luther again this weekend.

“1 think it's going to have to be that same en
ergy that we had during the invite," Lankicwicz
said. “A lot of team spirit, a lot of getting people
motivated and really cheering on our teammates.
We’re going to have to step it up. It's going to be
the hardest duel we’ve had." _ ‘

Both teams continue to pick up steam headr
ing into the WC Championships, where they
hope to he crowned as team champs once more.

, “We always plan to repeat, and we plan to re-
peat again this year," Hammond said. “There are
some teams that are getting betteriLake Forest
has gotten progressively better in the last‘ two to
three yeaand are going to be a challenge for
our team. As a whole, I’m conﬁdent that both
[the men's and women’s teams] can do it again."

Lankiewic’; is conﬁdent about another con-
terence championship as well.

College players that'ditch their college teams for the NBA after one year create a lot of excitement, fill seats

Imagine that you are a uppers'echelon high school basket- both mentally and physically/Lin preparation for the rigors of

get named to national allrstar teams, and are constantly

tential like North Carolina's Ed Davis or Oklahoma's Wil»

barraged by college coaches begging you to come play
for them next year. After that, it's offto a long, lucra-
tive career in professional basketball. Your situation
sucks, right? Miami Heat Center Jermaine O'Neal
thinks so. ,

Nearly ﬁve years ago, NBA Commissioner
David Stem instituted a new requirement for
eligibility in the NBA draft, making it necessary
for players to be at least’19 years old and at least
one year removed from the graduation of their high
school class. The new rule effectively forced the best
high school players to play college basketball for.
one season before making their inevitablejump to
the bigs. O’Neal, himselfa high school draftee,

lie Warren must be Dirry Projectors fans because they
decided stillness was the move and stuck around an
additional year to hone their skills. Equally imporr
tant to the resulting positive development of these
young players, the rule has provided a boon to cola

legc basketball in general. .

The rules consequence for college has over-
whelmingly been that the most talented high
school players take part in NCAA hoops rather

than jumping to Europe or the NBA Developmenr
tal League, as some sports pundits predicted. College
ball offers better exposure, so guys like Kevin Durant
(Texas), Derrick Rose (Memphis), 0.]. Mayo (USC)
and Kevin Love (UCLA) spent a single season

And while Jermaine might have more ap- Kramer s R 5 ege ball more exciting simply by adding to

propriately called this bias classism rather
than racism if he had gone to college, avoiding misnomers isn’t
what NBA players get paid for. The average NB'A salary comes
down to about two public schoolteachers' annual salaries per
game, so the amount of money lost during that interim year by
a wouldbe flrstround draft pick is quite signiﬁcant.

While this ﬁnancial argument is the strongest piece ofevir
dence against the age minimum, it’s not very compelling to me.
I’m not going to feel bad for the guy who has to go to the
college ofhis choosing for free, delaying his annual payday of
millions by a single year, In my opinion, the mic is not all bad
for the players, because it gives them another year to mature,

the ranks of freakishly talented individuals
creating highlights every time they touch the hall. The NBA’s
new rule forces the best of the best to play college, and so we
get to see freshmen like Kentucky’s John Wall or Durant step in
and immediately'contend for national player of the year honors.
The star-power provided by definite future first-round picks is
an added incentive for casual fans to tune in to the excitement,
color and pageanrry ofcollege basketball. This added exposure
will win college hoops more fans and more money through
higher TV ratings when they contrast the deeply passionate
environment of college hall with the rote sterility and perfuner
tory play of the NBA. However, there have been some nega

tive consequences in the college game. Some commentators,
most notably former coach Bob Knight, have denigrated the
rule as compromising the purity of college basketball because
“one and done" players don't need to pass more than six credit
hours for rhe fall semester, and don't have to even take classes
in the spring semester. This argument, however, is silly. College
basketball lost its innocence with the advent of nationally-tele-
vised games in the 1970s, and its been as much about money
as it has been about winning ever since. so even though short
term stars might not win a national title, they put butts in arena
seats and lend national relevance to programs with regional fan
bases,like Michael Beasley at Kansas State.

The only other negative consequence for the college game
is that freshmen departing for the draft can leave the cupboard
bare for some teams. Some highly touted prep prospects with
the size and athleticism that is attractive to the pros who didn’t
fare as well in the university ranks like UCLA's Guard Jrue
Holiday were still drafted far higher than the level of their col-
legiate play recommended. Holiday averaged about nine points
in 27 minutes per game his freshman year, but was taken with
the 17th overall pick. Holiday’s early entry to the draft dev-
astated this year’s Bmins squad, which is currently one game
below .590, making them unlikely to make the NCAA tourr
nament after having gone to the Final Four three of the last
five years. It may be hell on coaches to have to replace their
most talented young players, but that was happening before the
age minimum was enacted and leads to greater parity, which is
good for the game. Now the programs like UCLA that have the
pick of the litter of prep rccmits have to contend with programs
that don’t recruit as well but are able to put a system in place
and develop players over four years, which means that March
Madness will only be gerting madder as the consequences of
the ”one and done” i'uie are more fully realized.
