think that Renee, Fiankie and I were the only three iCr
tivistsiand may be there was one othei—vvho actually
had insutancc through the company Blue Cross and Blue
Shield We were at the companys office with a letter of
demands that we had sent ahead of time. We wanted in'
formation from the CEO, and for the company [to] EXT
lilbit transpareney, like explaining why certain individuals
had been excluded from health care olicies. I know for a
fact that all three ofus were arrested ater that day. Frankie
was 11 at that time

I recently saw a video on Democracy Now featuring
Frankie where she mentions you; and let me tell you, it
was so heartwarming to see that spirit in someone her
age, inspired by a Grinneuian.

The last six weeks I have been doin these die-ins [at]
the Federal Buildin in Des Moines. rankie showed up
at the one [on] Apti 7 and 1 was already dead on rhe ﬂoor,
dnoiag my thing in Hatkin's office that da .The she came

hen people wanted us to leave for t e day since the
ediﬁce was closing, she chose to stay with me because she
understood the message that I represented so completely.

Would you like to explain the dierin? After all, you
are the expert.

[Laughs] Im learning as I 0. That's interestin be
cause I have met other peop lew o I thought might now
what a die in is and absolutely didn't.

The dlerln is an experiment in nonviolent actions. You
can think of the sltr'lns in the South in the 60s but this
isn‘t the same. But as soon as you say that, people get the
idea. Literally, I lay down on the ﬂoor.

I put pieces of caution tape on the floor to signify the
suffering, the torture and the death that' is happening at
the hands of my government. I literally lay my body on
that on the floor and that sit! I have done all the talking
I can do by that point. I lay with this note “My peace—
ful sir-in is now a peaceful die in lwill remain here until
my senator (and I say my senator intentionally) until they
publicly commit to vote against any additional funding for
the wars in Ira and Afghanistan." The $33 billion war-

u lementin end'ln Bill is comin u and I reall

doPEelicvc thagt 1P have tghe possibilitygofllntlueneing my
senators votes Two long serving senators that I believe
could have the guts to say no to the war funding and turn
this thing around, to get the whole country turning in the
right direction, I really believe that,

Another thingI have done with my die-in [in] this par-
ticular case is lending the weight ofmy body and choosing
to stay. I finally trusted the police to remove my body. I am
absolutely unwilling to leave the Federal Building on my
own will. I‘m not worried about being arrested.

You’ve mentioned arrests at least two times in this
interview, and I understand Lhzl every aspect of a life
committed to social activism is not always positive I
read In 2003 you were aetualiy arrested in for civil dis-
obedience outside Ft Benning, GA and eventually
served a three-month prison sentence.

I faced a very unitive judge, G. Mallon Faircloth. He
actually sentenceg me to a six-month sentence the {01*
lowing year. In the end, it is not that had of an idea to
put peacemakets in jail with the 2.2 million incarcerated
Americans.

Could you describe your experiences injail?
Don't do it.

What about Grinnellians that might admire your
work or your commitment to social justice and there—
fore, find themselves in similar circumstances? Is jail
worth it?

“[211 in the end, like I said, my life has been ti'tinSr
tormetl. The original Qiakci .rleu hehind jail was rhur
you Scpdrzln: people from society to get I‘ oimcri. But I
have been transformed. I have accepted jail t. one ofmy
mott- valuable life cxpclicnccs. Althougli,1 still would not
recommend ti it tin' ne unlit light into a situation like
that. But the k ', l\/IJ|CIIS;—[llc gift fioin [lLli—l
no longcti ' The worst pliliislim itlny goyclnmcnt
can bestow upon me for spoiltn list in] rites his
n-anstornied me into this. .\'oww Win-h outl 7
