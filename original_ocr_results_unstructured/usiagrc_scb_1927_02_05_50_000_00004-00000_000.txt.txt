Local Main Discusses .
Bank Guaranty Laws

Discussing the history of bankguar—
unty laws belorc c. G. Eubank‘s course
in Financial Organization Wednesday.
C. A. Blair declared, “A sound
bank guaranty law is a. good thing, but
any proposal which places the whole
burden on a single class or society,
without any reference to its responsi-
bility for depressed conditions, is vic-
ions, 1 ant opposed to any guaranty
law which would make a suund bank in
Grinncll my tor the bank failures of
northern Iowa.”

Mr, Blair, who bus made u detailed
study of guaranty legislation, traced
the history or such laws from their be-
ginning in New York a Century ago, to
the present Nebraska law which is re-
ceiving so much attention now, He
quoted one Nebraska bunker as saying
that the act in Nebraska is unsound,
because “it tends to penalize prudent
banking and to encourage reckless op-
crations."

The greatest objection to guaranty
laws, according to the speaker, is that
some banks are required to pay more‘
into the safety fund over a period of
years, than the total of their Capital
stock.

Education of the young women for
their real Career, “marriage." is the
aim of the new college rounded in
Bl'onxville, New York. The donor or
the 31,250,000 gift stated that only
recently had his views been so defir
nitely decided.

Although the wholc Grinncll lineup
put their names in the scoring column
in Thursday night's game at Allies, the
Cyclones were able to count irum the
field enough times oltcner than the
Pioneers to win by a 3:; to 29 com
Even though defeated Couch Haye
quintet showed a great improvement
in one n-e power that bodes well for
future ’ctories. Coggeshall counted
the bdkcts and two free tosses to
hold high point honors in the contest,
Two baskets apiece were garnered

ahead as the hall ended with the score

A letdown in the Pioneer defensive
combine allowed Staver, Elliott and
I ing to score heavily, and Ames soon
ran up a comfortable lead. With the
score standing 27—18 against them,
Griunell team started a spurt that i
dlcated a possible Pioneer victory, but
scoring on the part oi Wagner and
Fcucmu swelled the Ames total suf-
tlcicntly to ward off a Grinnell last
minute win.

Coggcshull Stars

Coggeshall played d fine olfeusive
game, but allowed his opponent to
score rather heavily. The floor work
of the blond boy was spoken of as the
best seen on the Iowa State court this
season. Fail pluyedo line game at
guard, as did Niblo at center. Chase
was not hitting the hoop with the fre-
quency that he did in the Drake game,
but nevertheless was a powerful tater
tur in the oircnsiyc machine.

Kling played a. great game for the
upstate team, counting twelve points on
four baskets and a like number of free
throws. Stave: added four baskets to
the Ames score, and played a fine
floor game. Captain Aaron Miller of
thc Cyclone team was out of the game
because or serious injuries received in
an earliergume, and watched the work
of Grimes, Cyclone football star, in his
former position.

But there are two ways of making
it always a triumph. One is to wear
