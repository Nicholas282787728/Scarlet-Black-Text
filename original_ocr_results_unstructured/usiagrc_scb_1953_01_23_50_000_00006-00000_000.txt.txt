Debaters Plan Long Season

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Grinnell debaters are prepar-
ing for next semester's season
with hopes of participating» in
eleven or twelve tournaments.

“Finances are playing the de-
termining role as to the actual
number in which we will par—
ticlpate,” said Nicholas Cripe,
faculty sponsor. “Probably the
outstanding debate event onl
campus this year will be the
Midwest debate conference Feb.
27 and 23. ,

“This is the first time in l
the history of the conference
that such a tournament has
been held. Yresident Samuel
N. Stevens has donated a
beautiiul trophy tor the win-
ning debate team at the con- ,
ierence.“

Marilyn Eichenauer, Read
senior, and Dave Dickson,
Langan senior, are co-chair- l
men oi the debate conference. ,

Grinnell S’rudenis Say . . .

Why do you think’ so many
students want to leave Grine,
nell'!

Chatlra Busck, Mears fresh-
man: I know why girls are
leavingihoys in other schools.

Barb Newman, l-laines senior:
Glrls~the social life is reallyl
inadequate for girls who don’t‘
date. I think more people sayi

they are going to leave than'

do. it is just something to gripe
about,

Bob Norton, Dibble junior:
The social setup isn’t any good.
The college doesn’t otter enough
work in specialized tields.

Frank Hays, north Younker
sophomore: Inability for people
to think for themselvesein-
ability to form any degree of
responsibility to themselves be
cause of strict discipline—my

reason for thinking of leaving,

Evi Grottewit, Haines sopho-
more: Obviously because of its
restrictions which are driving
everyone insane.

The above question was sub-
mitted by Sally Partner, Haines
senior, and was judged best by
Lucy Tye, 5&3 editor, and
Norm Cohen, Chesterfield rep-
resentative on campus.

ror turning in the best ques-
tion Sally will receive one
hundred free Chesterfield cig-
arettes.

Entries for the next contest
should be turned in to the 5&3
ottice by Tuesday. Feb. 10,
