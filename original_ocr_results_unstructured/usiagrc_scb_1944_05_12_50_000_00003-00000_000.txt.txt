Twas Sprung

, Spring day, after much wishful
thinking and watchful waiting
finally sprung last Tuesday just
about five minutes before every-
one was ready tc give up. Al-
though the initial enterprise was
almost ruined (the hell Stuck) a
janitor intervened and saved the
day (literauy).

Spring day in the New Grin-
nell had some rather surprising
results too. Everything progress
ed normally and according to plan
at first. The girls performed
their tasks' with the usual zeal
scrubbing down the grass, plants
ing grass seed in the gutters, and
whitewashing each other. At least
the innocent bystanders were
safe.

At the picnic, however, things
were different. The first hint of
things to come occurred when the
faculty began pelting each othei
with eggs. Then when two wom»
en staged the annual mud fight
tradition began to fade. When
the men discarded chivalry and
threw in Gerry Ross, tradition
disappeared. And from then on
the bars were down. Chivalry
was out for the duration and the
girls were in 7 in the mud. Fori
the first tim'e in the history ofi
Grinnell Spring days, everybody
was thrown into the mud pit. And
for the first time in the history
of Grimell, everybody took baths
hetween 2 and 2:30 P. M.

The rest of the afternoon was

comparatively calm and peaceful

‘A strange place our state would be _ it our

thousands of miles of improved highways sud-
denly ceased to exist.

.?

Many communities would be isolated.
Think of a state without trucks; or without
cars or buses taking workers to war plants and
farms; soldiers to camp or home; business
travelers to their jobs; children to school.

We rake for granted the convenience of
our excellent roads—but highways don’t just
grow. For them we can thank our state gov-
ernment, particularly our State Highway Com-
missmn, as well as yourselves—the taxpayers.

.As fellow citizens, Overland Greyhound
Lines havc_gladly paid substantial license, fuel
and operating taxes. Our greatest service how,
ever, is in putting the highways to work for all
who must travel, making good neighbors of all
the communities we serve in this state.
