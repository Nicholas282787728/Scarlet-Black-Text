The requisition for additional

given an added impetus by the con—

Following Mr. Fee's screen tests in
California last summer, we ﬁnd his
appearance on the local screen, Mr.
Fee's secrecy concerning these tests
can only he explained by the fact that
he wanted to surprise his Grinnell
following.

Above is a still from “Limehouse
Nights" showing Mr. Fee (on the left)
assisting Dr, Hoover appoint his Com-
mission on Doric Censorship, the
President's generous offering toward
the Ideal for the current week. We

recommend this picture highly.

in the nineties shows that bicycle
racing also had its day as a collegi-
:Lte sport in the state. A two mile
bicycle race was held with Spaulding
of Grinnoll winning in 5:53 and the
one-half mile bike event went to
Garrison of Iowa in 125%. Henry
took the mile walk in 7:42 2-5 and
the hop, skip and jump was won by
Wheeler of Grinnell with as feet 4
inches.

In 1891 the state meet was held at
Iowa City and Marshslltown with
Grinnell winning. The Pioneers took
21 points, Cornell 13, and Iowa 17.
A note on this record says that the
Grilmell victory was due to system-
atic training and that the Maltese
cross was introduced as the Grinch
insignia at that meet. An all around
even: was added for the meet with
Boardman of Cornell winning it with
13 points.

IIltlnmerr‘I‘lii'ow Added

At the meet, held in Des Moincs
the following season, the standing
broad jumps, with and without
weights, were dropped and the ham-
mer throw and low hurdles added.
Grinnell won again with 24y, points
to Iowa’s 181/2. Drake placed in the
state ceet for the ﬁrst time with Rod-
well's first place in the low hurdles.

won with 52 points to Grinnell‘s 50.
The bicycle racing and walking
events continued to be used until 1903
and the hammer throw was not drop
pod trom the program until 1906, ac-

oordiny to the records on ﬁle at the
athletic office here.

Ray’s Paper to Be Given
at Chemical Society Meet
Francis E. Ray, instructor in chemr
istry at Glmuell college, will read a

paper on "Asymmetric Diazo Com—
pounds" at the annual meeting of

PAGE THREE

thc American Chemical society, to be
held at Atlanta, April 5-10.

Mr. Ray‘s paper will present the
solution which he has found to a
problem on which Professor William
Albert Noyes and other noted chem—
ists have been working since 1918.
His experimentation in this ﬁeld con-
tinues the study of optical activity
begun by Louis Pasteur in 1343 on
the tartaric acids.

The paper which Mr. Ray will read
at Atlanta is based upon the dis-
sertation which he presented recent-
1y at Oxford university for the degree
of doctor of science, which will be
conferred upon him next June.
