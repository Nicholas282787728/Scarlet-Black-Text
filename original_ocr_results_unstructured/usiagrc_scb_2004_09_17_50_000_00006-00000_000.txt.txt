Environmental catastrophe and
the horrors of Big Macs

The Day After Tomrorow
(PG-13)

The Day/{ﬁn Tommie is an ectrfriendly movie
that uses heavy-handed special effects to give us a pic
ture ofwhat the earth would look like ifglobal warms
ing actually existed. Well, that's only half true. The
special effects are a hit too much, out global warming
does existrlust like leprechauns, Writer/director Roi
land Emmerich tries much too hard to drive home a
message of environmental awareness

The special effects are amazing, but cheesy mor
ments, like escaped zoo animals prowling around the
tundra orNew York City, push everything a little over
the top.The movie follows the story of Adrian Hall
(Dennis Quaid) a paleoclimatologist, yes a paleoclir
matolog'tst, who predicts the impending storm and
warns the government, Hall's warning is ignored by
the vice president, who could be Dick Cheney's twin
brother, and as a result, millions ofpeople die. Hall's
own son, sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes trapped in
New York City in the eye ofthe storm. 5am stru gles
to survive while his father leads a desperate mission
to rescue him. sometime during the movie. Sam gets
a girl and strengthens his shaky relationship with his
dad. Sweetl

overall, the story is a hit disjointed and because
there is so much going on, it's hard to fully appreciate
the generous hiirt-whuppin' that mama earth is hand
ing out like candy It's not a had movie, but everything
is so exaggerated that by the end of the ﬁlm, its hard
to care as much as you feel like you should. lfyou like
to tree the planet or if you dont like New York City.
this is deﬁnitely a movie to uatch. Hnot,just watch it
because paleoclimatologists rock.

having no iniluonee on his actions. She even has long
hair! But despite being bedfellows with stereotypes,
their interactions are the funniest parts of the movie.

While Spurlock keeps Super Size Me palatable de-
spite being full of fairies, there are a few moments in
which he unnecessarily forces your stomach to churn.
First, on Day 1 of his McDonald’s Diet, he vomits
out ofllis car window, and then has the camera peer
outside the window, down at the vomit. We all can
imagine what a regurgitated Quarter Poul-Adel would
