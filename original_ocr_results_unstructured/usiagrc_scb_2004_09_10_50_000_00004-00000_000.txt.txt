save some first—year friends, it was
comforting to see families having
fun together at this community
festival. Food vendors, carnival
rides and arts and crafts booths
peppered Central Park. Surveying
the scene, I felt like I was viewing
summer‘s triumphant last stand.
The Cutie Contest was in full

swing. About ten months old, most of the squirmt
ing babies were dressed up in colorful pinafores and
had funny tufts ofhair sticking up from their round
heads. They peddled their chubby legs in the air,
waiting anxiously for the awarding of titles such as
“Little Boy Blue" and “Twinkle Toes.”

As a young Grinnellian
with no family in tow,
it was comforting
to see families having
fun together at this
community festival.

Leon Rowell, an experienced
bystander, explained that those
who have ears registered get to

You could browse more than

player. It was also reported rhat the model trains in
the museum near the Depot occasionally crashed at
the crossing points.

Withstanding the intrigue of small town draa
ma, the most important part ofHappy Days is that
many Grinnell organizations beneﬁt from fund-
raising opportunities and many local families have
a chance to spend a beautiful day together (it hasn't
rained in eight years).The other students and I cer-
tainly enjoyed our Saturday afternoon, and we are
looking forward to Ag. Day, on Sept. 9, which will

offer yet another perspective on Iowan life.
