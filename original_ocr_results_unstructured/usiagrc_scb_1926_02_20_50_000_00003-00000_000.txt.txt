With the interdorm basketball
championship resting in Dibble hall
for another year. it is customary for
the Scarlet and Black to pick an all
dorm team. Because or so many ex»
cellent players lrom each building it
has been a diliicult task to select a
team and has been necessary to pick
a iirst and second A team and D. iirst
and second B team. Eeeause oi the
equal ability ot many at the interdorni
cagers it hs been a tossun for most or
the pos ons with scarcely any dit-
ference in the ability or men selected
on the ﬁrst and second team.

1st B Team
Felton (6)

Branson (6)
Spencer (5)
Car-hart (6)

Several good men were leit oil the
mythical teams because they par-ti
pated in only a few games. Morgan
Taylor would have easily won a place
had he played the whole series, and
the same applies to Don Wolfe and
Jack Locke.

Hard to Pic]: Forwards

Dibble hall landed the most places
on the A selections, winning three
out o! the ten 'positions. Langan.
Clark. and Building III each get two
places and Smith hall one. on first
A team Struble and Patton are given
the lorward positions because or their
abilit' to snag baskets. Struble led
the individual scorers with Patton
in second place. There is little to
choose between these men and Sweet
and Culver who are forwards on the
second team. All four are clever

hasketeers. excellent floor men andl

good on defense. Larson's showing
ill the first few games of the series
gives him a slight edge on the center

position over Rinclort. Both are
Clitssy players and ideal centers, be»
ing I‘ﬂllgl', l‘ast. good dclcnsilo men,
and sure shots when near the basket

Caiiddl' and Stotts arc the choice [or
the guards Both know how to gel
the ball on the backboard in good
shape rind work it down the tloor
without wasting much time. Stott‘s
tloor work is especially praiscwortliy
and he greatly aided his team in [walk
in; the ball in the opponents tel-il-
tory. Becker and Lovejoy are also
good defensive inch but their work

Clark Second ll'ith Three

(in the all dorm B teams Dibble
again leads in copping the most plac-
cs. landing six out ol ten places.
Clark hall gets three places and Three

and Four one each. Brahson and

Felton are given the tor-ward positions
on the iii-st team. Although Branson
did not play the entire series, his work
'wos so scintillating when he did play
that he cannot be justly left oil. Both
loi these men work nicely togethcr.
'They pass well and are dead shots
under the basket. Nicolet and Cliilord
are two steady players and are easily
the choice tor the second team. Spen-
eer is placed at center on the ﬁrst
team because 05 his iumping ability
and all around tloor work. Martin
is the second best bet Ior the center
.position though he is closely pressed
by Selle or Two who did some brile
*lizmt work in several games.

Evalu ill Cm‘llhrt Gilliil'lls

Evhn and Carhart are the pick or
the guards, Evahn can also play lore
‘wzu'd but performs better at guard.
Both men handle themselves well and
know how to play their positions.
Brooke and Carl are placed at guards
‘on the second team in recognition or
their consistent play.

The intei-dormitory basketball
tournament this year was one or the
best ever conducted and much credit
and praise is due Assistant ilanagcr
Patton who had charge or the series.

staver and Kline are two other Cy-
clone aces. the former a center and
the latter Elliott’s running mate at
tnrwai-d. Both are dangerous men
but so far this season have been on-
ablc to hit their scoring stride.

Arnold and Miller are the guards
and they put up good defense against}
opposing lorwards. They are the
biggest men on the Ames sound and
play hard and fast games. Grimes
is a new man at guard but he has
shown up well in the tew games that,
he has played.

Coach Black’s men should give the

aggregation displayed considerable
strength in the Bulldogs battle and
will probably take the lloor against
the Chandler coached quintet.
