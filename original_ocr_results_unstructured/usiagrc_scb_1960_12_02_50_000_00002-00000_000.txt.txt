it there were a single locus of

These are just a few of the

hours to clarify the SC consti-

{and thoroughly investigated at
{that time.

The convention would of ne-
,cesslly coordinate the attempts at
:i-cform in the present groups. The
lelcetetl delegates would most like-
,ly be these who‘are most inter-
lestccl in, and knowledgeable (or
‘al least, most Willing to learn)
about student government.

With a convention, direct com-
Vl‘nunicution with the administra-
ition on the difficulties would be
{much easier. But the most basic
lienson {or a convention is the
right of the student body to gov-
ern itself to the extent delegated
by the administration.

I thereiore support the hokL

In the event n constitutional
convention is voted favorably by
the students, a committee of SC
should set up the framework for

the proposition that the results of
said convention be submitted to
the student body at a special
election for their approval or dis-
approval .

Again. I urge the students to
vote YES on the question. "Shall

tion to amend or revise student

College students take great pride in concerning them-
selves with civil rights, federal aid to education and other
lrzttters. Yet all of what they do for these causes is hypo-
Cl' icul and meaningless if they do not act to preserve the
only means by which it democracy can exist. The public
irust know and be allowed to net.

It is not for Americans, supposedly concerned with
freedom and equality, to sit in a lounge and bicker over
the amount of regulation which is to be impo'sed upon the

makes possible that freedom and equality in which they
profess so much faith. If the people are not allowed to
lrnow, then this framework will surely topple as it is
eaten away by the rust of misinformation and deception.
