T is an oitlnentioned fact that
the students here are usual

1y carrying a large amount of
work besides regular class work.
And too much outside work is to
be avoided. Yet there is one
sort of work that no student can
afford to lose and that is good
faithful work in a literary society.
The societies have something to
otter that no other part or the
college work or college lite can
give. The arguments in iavor of
the society are selt evident and
too well known to need mention.
But they should not become so
familiar that they are neglected.
The society offers a pleasant and
valuable method of intellectual de-
velopment along certain lines, and
this practice is sule to be helpful,
whatever protession or business
may be taken up later in lite.
Ability in public speaking will
never come amiss and the train-
ing to quick thought and decision
gained by debating is always use-
fult The social side of the liter-
ary society, too, should not be
overlooked. Especially to new
students the society offers a place
for meeting others and getting ac-
quainted with them in the best
possible way, where the teal ambi-
tion and ability of tile students

are best seen.

WALKER WHITESIDE.

The long expected presentation
of the “Merchant of Venice" is at
last to be made at the Colonial
Saturday night. Walker White-
side.wlloheadsthecompanywhich
will play it, was here last year in
“Heart and Sword,” and was
booked for a later date in the
“MerchantofVenice,"butlhisdate
was cancelled after being post-
poned twice.

Mr. Whiteside has long been
known as one of the most intellir
gent interpreters of Shakespeare
on the American stage. He has a
pleasing manner and a voice which
is quite wonderful for a man of his
size. He is one of the very law who
have been ableto keep Shake-
spearian tragedy popular during
the late period ot the romantic
comedy, and although he has tlir
grassed somewhat, nevertheless he
has given the larger part of his
time to Shakespeare. and will no
doubt be seen in his old time form.
Such a presentation is an invalur
able supplement to the English
work,especiallylhe drama course.
