Grinnell Meets
Drake Here

Bulldogs Doped to Win
Contest Saturday

Although Drake has only defeat-
ed Grinnell traekmen once during
the past nine years in the annual
outdoor dual meet, G. Lester Duke,
varsity track coach, feels that this
Saturday the Bulldogs will annex
their second victory.

Drake walleped Grinnell 73%.
301,43 in the indoor meet lost Feb-
ruary and although Duke is cone
fident the Pioneers will make a
better showing Saturday, he feels
that the Drake team is too strong
for the Pioneers to conquer.

Many times during the past nine
years the Drake squad has been
doped to heat the Grinnell team in
the outdoor meet, but only once
have they succeeded in doing it,
he said.

Grinnell’s entries for the meet
are: lzn-yard high hurdlesﬁﬂayr

two thousand years ago.
