Choir Returns Alter Concerts Breakdown, Fun

By Jane Gnddis

A weary c o l l e g c choir
stumbled into Grinnell Monday
night after a weekend of chills,
bus breakdowns and successful
concerts.

The choir recorded a half.
hour program Saturday, which
is to,be aired ovcr station WGN
tomorrow at 2:30 p, m. The same

program can be heard over the
Mutual Network Sunday at ii
a, m. No concerts were sched—
uled either Saturday or Sunday
evenings, and choir membersl
went sightseeing in the big-
town, took in shows, or just
plain recuperated.

An appreciative audience, in—
cluding many familiar faces,
braved the low temperature and

icy pavements Sunday aftera
noon to hear the choir sing at
Austin high school. A concert

at the YMCA Hotel, where more
than half of the choir members
were staying over the weekend,
followed

The tour came to an abrupt
conclusion~ Monday evening,
when one bus arrived in Watr

crloo at 9 p. m. for a 7:30 enr
gagement, only to find that the
other bus had stalled in Daven-
port, and that the scheduled
concert had been cancelled.
One busload stranded fifty
miles east of Davenport, took
shelter in two nearby farmr
houses. The bus pulled in to a
farm yard because of a faulty
fanbclt, according to one ob—

server. They were hospitably
received in a tiny house by a
farm woman who called a
neighbor who also received
some of the stranded choiristere.
I They were fed coffee and
doughnuts and cocoa and woke
ies and sang to their hostesses.

Reactive comments during the
trip ranged from “I'm goin to
have a stroke," to “Glamorous!”

Social Budget l

Some twenty men students
moved Wednesday into the com-
pleted English basement section
of Younker Hall. All nineteen
residents of Pine Tree also are
expecting to move sometime
next week into Cleveland and
James halls.

The college is vacating and
closing both Bray House and
Pine Tree due to the large ex-
pense of maintaining these resi».
dences when rooms on campus
are available.

Mainly Bray

Dean of Men, G, Lester Duke,
announced that the majority of
Younker’s first tenants are for-
mer occupants of Bray House,
some students living in rooms
in town, and a few hall trans-
fers,

The men will retain their for-
mer hall affiliations and the
hall will have no formal orga—
nization this spring.

Full tenancy of'Younker Hall
is expected by early spring.

Pine Tree Change

In the event that the Quad-
rangle has a number of vacant
Irooins available, the girls in
Pine Tree will move about the
middle of next week. The fresh-
men girls will be moved into
James and Cleveland halls, while
the baffle board and house
chairman will be moved to var-
ious upper class halls. Mrs.
Thompson, house mother, will
live at the infirmary and be
employed somewhere on the
campus.

CommiHee Vales
Sem Fee Money
To Campus Radio

At a meeting earlier in the
week the Central Committee
voted to give KGRW the money
they requested from the Stu-
dent Council last month by in-
cluding it in the semester fee.
They felt that since KGRW is an
important means of communica-
tion on the Grinnell college
campus and maintains an active
staff of about 14% of the stu-
dent body, it deserves funds
from the semester fee. They
hope to establish a precedent by
putting it there.

KGRW is asking for the mon~
ey because of the high cost in—
volved when the administration
bought new equipment for the
radio station, including a record—
er and new control facilities, but
leaving no money for operating
expenses. Also KGRW has no
fund set aside for it as do the
other major organizations on
campus.

The amount that KGRW re-
quested was $174.96. This was to
include the purchase of records,
tubes for replacement, tapes for
recording, and incidental expen-
{ses It also will be used to bring

the results of out of town athlet-
ic events back to Grinnell by
telephone for broadcast.
