N0. 3: A REMEDY

With this issue the Scullct and Block coll-
cllides its series of edito 'als upoli the Gr i-
nell system of student participation in gov-
eminent.

Today it is our purpose to suggest zl plan

whereby the four major disadvantages of
the present system of student government
which were discussed in last Friday’s edi-
torial may be removed.
(1) The remedy for complcr y in Ol‘gani L-
tiail: The diagram at the bottom of the page
will help to explain Iiow a simplification in
the setup of student government may be
achieved. More specifically, there are ways
in which the coinposl ion of the Student
Council may be simplified:

Membership of the Student Council: three
senior men and three senior- women elected
from the stildcnt body at large.

Method of electiol by the entire stus
dent body with nomination by a primary
election and election from the six men and
six womeli receiving the highest number of
votes iii the primary.

Tillie of electiol before elections of
other student governing bodies, the officers
assuming their duties the first peek of May.

“G—
(2) The l‘cmedy for lack of responsibility of

officers to the student body: This lack ill
our present system should be met by pro-
visions l'or the recall, the initiative, and the
referendum.

R6031 a. petition signed by twenty-five
per cent of all the students would order an
election to determine whether the official in
question should remain in of ce.

Initiative' a petition signed by ten per
cent of the students would order an election
upon ally specific question, the outcome of
which would be binding upon the council.

tefcrcndum: the council could request on

expression of the popular will by submitting
any question to 2‘. stucéent vote.
(.9) The, l’cﬁtC’Il/j/ for tho coll/mini). of legis-
llltl , and administrative functions: The
auditor and social chairman should be ap-
poiiitcd by the council to early out the rule
liliillsti’ativc functions of those officers.

Auditor. appointed by the council in cons
sultotion with the Faculty Committee on
Eiliployment rind the head of the department
of Busiiics‘ Adliiiiiistration, and responsible
to the council and to the treasurer of the
college.

Social chairman: appointed by the coun-
cil ili consultation with the Faculty Com—
mittee on Employment and responsible to
the council.

(l) Tllr l‘lrmctll/ for tho Incl. y atloll of
l’L’SPO’lZSlbllltJ/ (lillollg the \m Oils gomiiiillg
bodies. There should be definite powers
rescued to the Council of House Piesidcnts
and to the Women s Executive Boaid.

Here an analogy may be drawn between
our campus government zliid the United
States goiel'llnlellt. As “as pointed out last
Friday, there are three spheres of govcl'lr
lncntzil influence on the campus: that coil-
ceriiilig the men, that concerning the wos
men, and that concerning both men and \v0-
men.

Those spheres ill which only the men or
only the women are interested may be conic
pared to the state governments. And that
splierc concerning the entire student body
may be likened to the federal government,

Lille the Federal Constitution, our Stil-
dciit Council constitution should define the
authority of the council and of the men’s
and women’s governing bodies—something
it does not do in ii definite manner at pre-
sent. For example, the Council should be
empowered to review acts of campus 01's
gauiv tioiis affecting the entire student
body; it should be empowered to take dis-
ciplinary action ill cases affecting the stile
dent body zit large; its authority orer so-
cial affairs should be continued and en-
lzlrged.

And the Council of House Presidents and
the Women’s E'chiti\'e Board should be
given all authority over those matters cons
ceruing the men or the women alone.
