Grinnell last Saturday and from
now onwill make his headquarters
here. His duties as president
will call him away much of the
time in response to requests for
his services, but from now on he
may be considered as being per-
manently identiﬁed with the col-
lege

THE HOME MEETI

The seventeenth annual home
held meet was run on on a heavy
track Saturdayr Fairly satisiao
tory records were made in the
one hundred yard dash, the relay
andthe jumps. Two home rec-
ords were brokcnethc high jump
by Haincsnaised an‘ inch and
three quarters and set at ﬁve feet.
seven and three-fourths inches,
and the relay, run in the excellent
time of one minute and thirty-six
seconds Grinnell’s records are
about of the same class as those
of the other colleges. The only
good records made have been
Pell’s broad jump ot 2] teet and
3 inches and his hammer throw of
I25 feet at Drake, and Scarr's
time in the clashes at S U. 1,
Little or nothing can be learned
by a comparison or records at
this time. Grinnell’s records could
have been bettered Saturday in
every event excepting perhaps
the high jump and hoprstep-alldr
jump, and the same may be said
of the other schools. Yet from
Saturday’s meet some idea may
be gained ofthestrcngthofGrinr
hell's team. Most severely, of
course, is Ielt the loss of Conger
in sprints and relay. This is a
loss that Grinnell cannot make up
this season, and that will mean a
serious difference in every meet.
Lyman and Evans too were
missed by their class at the meet
Saturday, In the sprints, conse-
quently, Iowa College will be
much weaker than she had hoped
early inthe season. In the dis-
tnnces the chance {or points at
state is not very encouraging. In
the jumps our prospects at pres-
enl look brightest, tor we have
possible point winners in every
one of them. In the hurdles the
outcome is very uncertain, though
we have hopes, and in the weights
nsnsual,thel‘e is no Chance (or
the scmlel and black. While our
chance for ﬁrst in the relay is
gone with the loss or Conger and
Lyman, the remarkable time or
the Junior team Saturday gives
hope tor perhaps a third or possi—
ble second at the state meet, The
Coe meet next Saturday will give
a good test or the strength oi
the team. ,
