reached by the ordinary methods.

President Mnin's Address.

Jesus is a many sided character. His

liie is human—lie weeps with us and
reloices with us: it is divine. He in
so es us and leads us on and upward.
llis liie comprehends all liie, all phases
oi temptation and sympathy, deieat
and success. All lire is rewarded in
one liie. Christ’s lire is one oi periect
naturalness. To some it seems mirac
ulous, and that separates us iroin Him,
doing us wrong, and doing llim wrong.
He wants to be brother and iriend to
us.
He has mapped out a natural path-
way oi lire ior us to iollow until we
are like llim. Jesus assumes always
a natural relationship between us and
Him. Ills lire reaches down into ours
and ours up into Ilis, until they merge
in ODE.

The spiritoi Jesus is larger than
law—it rests upon the principle or
right and wrong. We are to observe
the Spirit oi Love, and the letter or
the law. Then shall we abide in Him,

Wherever an adinstment takes place
between us and God, there the Kings
dom oi Heaven is it rests upon us to
bring about this periect relationship,
which isa pertectly natural one. “I
am the vine, . are the branches. He
that abldeth in me, and l in him, the
isame boareth much frult.”
