Capt. Roger Nelson, who last,

position this year, although he
will be facing stiff competition,‘
according to Coach Duke,
The Pioneer mentor may enter

Saturday night at Chicago, but
has not definitely decided to as
yet. “Whether Grinnell enters the

showing of the men Friday night,"
Duke said yesterday. “As it is I
am not certain that I will take
anyone to the meet.”

Individual Adjustment
Advocaled by Speaker
at Co-eds’ Conference

”Should the world be shaken up
to make a place for the individual
or is it the individual’s place to
adjust himself?" This was a ques-
tion which Mrs. Chase Going
Woodliouse asked in her address,

:“Potentialities Within the World

of Today and Tomorrow,” given

‘before a statewide meeting of the

Women’s Self-Govelmment 2.5507
ciation at Cedar Falls last satur-
day.

“Both," she answered, and add—

 

tialities of the world and of our.
selves in order to im -ove “world
cycles. We must think of public
affairs," she sai , “and make in-
telligent- participation in these ate
fairs our goal."

In speaking of women‘s place in
the economic world, she explained
that their position has been
strengthened by the fact that they
are not making jobs a stop-gap
between school and marriage, that
they are becoming really serious in
their careers and continuing them
after marriage.

She added along this same line
that women have been educated
to cooperation more than have
men and that because a new con
operative trend has entered busi-
ness, women are now well adjust-
ed to the business world.

Mrs. Woodhonse outlined thc
various fields which now hold par-
ticular vocational opportunities
for women such as factual adver-
tising of foods and other household
merchandise, social service admin
istration, and others

ELCOME HOMEI Thal's what
the amnion of railway travel

Ieally means nowadays. On the railroad—and

on the railroad alone—you can fully enjoy

yourself while traveling.

As you ride at high yel safe speeds, free from iolis

and skids, you can eat, sleep, lead, write, stretch, relax, listen to Lhe

radio, breathe cool, clean, sweet air and make yourself lully at home

under the kindly minishelions of courteous allendanls alert to your

evely need.

For these and other beneﬁts, you must credit thorough air-conditioning,

smart interior decoration, up-lo—daie car consllucﬁon, improved wade

beds, heavier rails, adequate power and—most important of all—a

personnel interested in service.

REMINDER . . .

Typical of railway modemizaﬁon for

comloli. is the fact that by the end of
the year the Illinois central will have
in service 157 air-conditioned cars of
its own, in addition lo air-conditioned

Pullman equipment. All the rdilloads
