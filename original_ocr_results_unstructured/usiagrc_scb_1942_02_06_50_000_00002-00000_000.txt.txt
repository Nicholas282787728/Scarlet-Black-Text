0 That Fellow Mars.

That fellow Mars has a queer way of doing
things. Here we are innocently enjoying
ourselves drinking cokes and going to the
“show,” and congratulating ourselves that
We are smart enough to keep our nose out
of other people‘s business, and then bingo!
he springs a war into our laps and disrupts
everything. He tears us away, apart, and
upside down so last we don‘t know which
Wily we are headingpr even if we have
heads any more.

. War does strange things to people. Tile
queer-est dopes turn out to be heroes, and
the ones you’d never suspect of it display
amazing reserves of guts. Then there are
the sane, well»balan.ced people who go ab—
solutely haywire and start buying sugar by

Chapel Talk

Davenport Rabbi
To Speak on "Judaism

in Democratic Process"

“The Role of Judaism in the
Democratic Process” is the
title of the address to be giv-

en by Rabbi Abram V. Good—
man, of Davenport, in chapel
Tuesday, Feb. 10, according to

—-——)

John Scott Evlertorl, clean of
chapel.
D'x‘. Everton said that Good-

ies .

the truckload and ill the dead of night
snitch other people’s auto tires

The queerest of all, however, is the way
war seems to bring out the hoodlum in the
human. The word “Japanese," with which
Americans in years past have associated all
that is tops in courtesy and good breeding,
in finesse of artistic taste and intellectual
perspicuity, acquires overnight the sinister
implication of shifty»eyed, underllanded
knifillg in the dark. Anything Japanese is
therefore contaminated and must be ruth-
lessly destroyed, Japanese art must be
ripped from public exhibits; Japanese made
articles must be smashed; all doubtful
Orientals must be insulted and maligned in
every way possible. As for the Germans;
nothing less than total extinction is coll-
ceivable.

Of course once the war is over we will be
magnanimous and forget all about these
hatrerls. What‘s a little war between
friends? The funny thing about that Yelp
low Mars, though, is that he never can seem
to see it our Way. He has a nasty way of
harboring resentments and springing them
on us at the unlikeliest times. He just
doesn’t play fair.

O This ‘Coke’ Problem.
With the rationing of the coke, will love die
out at Grinnell' The problem is serious

At least three-fourths of all the school’s
present romances began, grew and flourish
ed over this popular beverage Men with
but 10 cents between them and social ex-
tinction have been able to impress their
gills with a nickle bottle of the brown
liquid at the White House.

A dime coke and someone else‘s five cents
ill the box have provided evenings of life,
love and gaity at the Raven.

Cokes have made picnics out of mere
blanket parties; parties out of boring bridge
games. '

Generations of Grinnell men have depend-
ed upon the coke. Will Dr, Pepper take its
place?
