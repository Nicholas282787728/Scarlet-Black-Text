Netters continue winning

Volleyball is winningest Sport

“Dig." “set," and “spike" are
the primary thoughts of a
volleyball fanatic. During the past
couple of weeks, the Grinnell
women’s volleyball team
resembled volleyball fanatics as it
continued its busy schedule. Its
endless improvement of play has
upped its record to an amazingly
impressive 12 wins and three
losses.

In a small school like Grinnell,
the loss of experienced players
poses a great problem for the
coach. This year’s volleyball team
lost many of its experienced
players. However, coach Tom
Latimer’s present volleyball team
continues to surpass the ac-
complishments achieved by last
year’s squad,

Three freshmen have enabled
Latimer’s team to become a viable
contender for the upcoming state
tournament. These women, Cathy
Sessler, Alison Goodman and Dana
Weaver, have provided the team
with formidable defensive skills.

Most of the offense or “spiking”
is lead by the efforts of tri-captains
Marnie Curran, Anne Chasson. and

l Kim Brydon.

Last Saturday. the volleyball
team hosted a quadrangular meet.
The three visiting teams were
Monmouth, Luther. and Central.
The teams played “bestout-ot—
three" matches. Grinnell defeated
allthree of its opponentsin just two
games.

Tonight, the Pioneers compete in
a competitive tournament hosted
by powerful Graceland College.
Many state teams will be com-
peting in this tournament. Latimer
and the players don‘t aspire for
great accomplishments, Instead
this tournament is regarded as an
educational experience for the
team members.

Next Friday, Grinnell hosts
Central College. This match should
prove interesting since Central
presently is one of the few teams to
defeat Grinnell this year.

Stickwomen

get no

The Grinnell women's field
hockey team has been plagued
with misfortunes during the last
few weeks.

Captain Jill Kriesky commented,
“Although we’re at a loss with
several of our best players out, the
odds for our winning are not in-
surmountahle,”

Three of the team’s starters have
been sidelined with physical ins
juries. Sophomore Laurie Oragg
strained the ligaments in her left
knee, sidelining her for three
weeks until today’s game.
Sophomore Desiree Winkler has
been ill with a severe cold and

sophomore Stephanie Nelson

respect

broke her left ankle during
practice a week ago. She will have
a cast for six to eight weeks, thus
ending her play for this season,

The current inclement weather
has not been a great deterrent to
the Pioneers. They have practiced
everyday outside. supplied with
two sets of sweatsuits for extra
warmth.

This weekend. the team travels
north to play UNI and Luther. The
Pioneers tied UNI in a previous
battle, but hope to trounce them in
this next confrontation. The game
against Luther will be the
Pioneers’ first against that club
this year.

Female harriers stride
past everyone

By Tim DeCoster

Grinnell's women‘s cross
country squad handily upended
Visiting teams from Cornell and
William Penn last Wednesday in a
meet hosted by the Pioneers.
Grinnell achieved a perfect score
in the double-dual race. as it took
the first five places against each
opponent. '

half mile race, covering the
distance in 15:54. She was followed
by Sarah Birchford (15:40) and
Julia Carver (16:57) Terri Brady
was Gn'nnell’s fourth finisher and
Yafa Napadensky rounded out the
top iive. The times for the race
were only slightly slower than
expected despite the hilly course
and Iowa winds faced by the
runners.

Grinnell has already Won the
mythical conference title in the
sport, having defeated Knox and
Cornell in the Grinnell Invitational.
ln Wednesday’s meet, the Pioneers
took Cornell by a score of 1547 and
demolished Penn, llHO.

Tomorrow morning coach Kit
Wall takes her squad to the Central
Invitational at Fella. The two and a
half mile race marks the season
finale for the women. Wall's team

lfinishes the season with an ad-
mirable 5-0 dual-meet record. '
