til at Meeting 7

in an unofficial treasurers' re—
port, Lora Lee Pugh, Mears jun-
ior, said that Grinnell had spent
$240 for NSA last year and $84
for midwest conference organi.
zation actmties. Mack Wright,
Langan senior, reprn-teel that the
conference had gone ahead with
two programs: it reduced ad-
mission fees at conference games
for visiting school students and
advanced a social organization
ioea that would strengthen Grin-
,nell's social program. Beloit. ale
,though no longer a member of
the midwest conference, has re»
tained mcmbership in the bin
ganization which includes. Carle-
ton, Lawrence, Coe, C'ornell.
Knox, Monmouth, and Emma.
The platform presented by the
NSA consisted of suggestions
student discount
cards, a regional student art
show, correspondence with’ for—
eign universities, use of an NSA

riaculty rating system, and NSA-

sponsored movies. The sugges-

'tions. will be retained by the

council and kept on record for
possible use within the confer-
ence.

Beth Budd. Loose hall senior.
reminded the council that the
NSA organizaton would be
weakened by Grinnell’s with<
drawal and emphasized the in-
ternational work done by that
group. The possibility that the
conference schools might wish a
merger with NSA was noted by
Herb Huebsch, Cowles senior,
who felt that this shoul’d be

brought up at the midwest con—
; feren‘ce organization meeting at
15810“ this fall.
