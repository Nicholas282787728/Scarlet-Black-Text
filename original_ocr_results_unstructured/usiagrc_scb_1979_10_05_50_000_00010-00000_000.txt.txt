counting personal activity such as jog-
ging or weight training,” said ober-
miller, “Participation is the crux of
our program...l don't believe this is
ever going to be a spectator school.”

j’l‘he dearth oi spectators is a subject
that drew a variety of comments.
Most‘athletes would agree that spec»
tators provide a muchrdesired
stimulus during athletic competition.
Kim Krutilla said, “It’s important to
have fans when you’re dead beat at
the end of a game. You get an extra
spurt of adrenalin if people are
screaming and yelling.” Said Poison,
“I can participate, but I can‘t get exe
cited just watching a sport. [do think
specatators are important. Athletics
would slowly die away it there were
no spectators, if no one were in
terested enough to watch,"

One reason for the minimal attenr
dance at athletic evens may be the

greater tendency towards participa-
tion. Most members oi the campus
community are so involved, whether
in sports or other activities, as to
leave little time for the sport oi watchr
ing, or the watching oi the sport.

AS one who felt that lack of time
should provide no excuse for the lack
of spectators, Maggie Klingele said,
“I’m playing iield hockey, working
food service, carrying a lull course
load, and I‘m a student advisor. If I
have time to watch, others should...
Usually the only people who come out
to watch are the players irom the
other sports.“

Not all would agree that we have a
responsibility to support our teams. “I
could care less about watching some-
one else play. They should be out
there {or the pure joy oi playing, not
to have people watch them,” said

The campus does not cater to spec-
tators as a rule; there are no
cheerleaders, no marching bands, and
except tor the occcasional en-
trepreneur behind the home bleachers
at Rosenbloom Field, they offer no
concessions. Seating for events in the
PEG usually consists or one or two
rows oi told-up chairs.

Athletics as an essential element of
a liberal arts education is another
topic oi dispute. Certainly thcrc is a
current trend toward physical activir
