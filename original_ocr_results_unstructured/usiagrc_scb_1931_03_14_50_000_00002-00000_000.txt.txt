EIGHT O’CLOCK 0R MIDeMORNING CHAPEL?

Small attendance at chapel this year is a ser-
icns grievance, and ll justiﬁable one. Without doubt
chapel, while not always inspirational, has spiritual
Values not to he obtained in other places. The sig-
nificance of chapel talks and music is unique, and
generally means a distinct loss to those who miss it.
For this reason, then, chupcl should be held at n
time which will obtain the lztrgcst number of pol-r
sons in attendance. The question then is, what is
the best time to have chapel?

Before last year cllztpcl was a mid-morning
convocation. Thus, classes began at eight instead
of 8:20 as they do this year. Without question, nlpre
people attended chapel at that hour than go to
chapel now. Though this were true, chapel was
regarded by many as a more stopping-place be-
tween classes, or an opportunity for a brief datc,

so lhllt the attitude toll l‘tl talks and ml in u
often pcrfuuctol-ily appreciative or indifferent.
That is why one questions the merit, of o 1'.Cllll'll
l0 this 'chcdulc.

Oil the other hand, chapel at eight o’clock has
its difﬁculties too. A great number of students
enjoy chapel, but the temptation to sleep another
hour or even a few minutes if one has no early
class ovorpowcl's the desire for inspiration. Ill the
winter, when ,cight o’clock is cold and gray, one
is not so susceptible to that sort of thing and is
ilpt to mnsidci- the beneﬁt unworthy of the effort
cxpcildcd. This circumstance eliminates a considcn
able number of would-be chapel auditors—Linda

ncccssory. Consistent with this was the abandoning

to sophomore is made almost as difﬁcult as high
school to college by the sudden relaxation of rul s.
The adjustment to individual responsibility is hard

It secllls unfair that a few careless oncs should
