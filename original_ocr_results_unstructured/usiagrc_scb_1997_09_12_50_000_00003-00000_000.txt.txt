Turn on the radio

Part one in an ongoing series
of KDIC Dee Jay interviews

ANDREW ETTENHOFER
Staff Writer

In an attempt to keep
Grinnell informed about
those hoodlums atop Darby
gym, my goal is to interview
the DJs of one KDIC show
each week. To start this se
ries off right, 1 thought I
would start with The Man
himself 7 Station
ManagerBen Coakley
'99.

AE: What exactly
does the KDIC sta-
tion manager do?

BC: I make sure that
we (the station) come
ply with FCC regula
tions. I make sure that
all the equipment in
the studio works. I'
watch over the other
DJs and make sure

AE: As station manager,
you are part of the DJ
selection process. What
do you look for?

BC: First, we look for a DJ
who has knowledge in a par
ticular genre of music, like
jazz or British punk. We do
tend to shy away from clase
sic rock shows and variety

We are really looking for
shows that provide some
type of service to the
campus community -- not
to say that we always reject
classic rock shows, it’s just i S
that we try to bring in new

new service. We just have a
news director and other stu-
dents willing to collect and
broadcast local, national,
and international news. We
have some new strong indie
shows, resurgent country
shows, jazz shows, and ur»
ban shows. We have_two new
turntables and a new digi
tal recorder to replace the
old cart machine used to
play the PSAs. This will make
it much easier to record and
to play messages, so I en-
courage all campus organi-
zations to make PSAs. Gen-
erally, we are just trying to
reach out to the cam-
pus community and
be more involved.
AE: Enough about
KDIC itself, what’s
your show going to
b e
like?

AE: What’s the best part
and worst part of being
a [<ch DJ?

BC: The worst is not getting
phone calls or any other evi-
dence that anyone is listen-
ing to your show. You start
to feel like you’re just talk,
ing to walls. The best part is
having the ability to play
music and talk about it, and
also if someone out there
likes what they hear and
tells you about it. So just re—
member the request line is
26973328.

AE: Is there anything
else you would like to
share about KDIC before
we wrap up this inter—
view? Maybe something

shows, because we feel that
the students can already
find those kinds of shows on
other radio stations. We are
really looking for unique
shows that provide some
type of service to the cam-
pus community 7 not to say
that we always reject classic
rock shows, it’s just that we
try to bring in new and dif*
ferent shows. And I would
like to say thank you to all
those who did apply this se~
mester. And for those who
didn’t get a show, this

_ doesn’t mean KDIC hates

you. There were some very
tough decisions made this
year, and I certainly encour-
age all to try again next se-
mester. Scheduling also
plays a big part in our deci
sion. It’s hard to give every,
one the time slot they want.
AE: What’s going to be
new or special for KDIC
this semester?

to play the new stuff that
comes to us.

AE: List me five artists

play.

BC: $2 Pistols, Zen Frisbee,
Spatula, Resol, and Shinola.
AE: Are you going to try
to make your show the
model to which all other
DJs should aspire?

BC: Well, I will regularly play
my PSAs which I encourage
all DJs to do. But that’s
about it, They shouldn’t feel
obliged to play the same
stuff 1 do or ramble on like I
do. And don‘t make my mis-

body doesn’t know.

BC: Maybe one last thing,..I
think KDlC comes the clos-
est to pure college radio. It‘s
all student—run and student»
timed, and we should be ap-
preciative of that. Some
people think that KDIC has
a hidden agenda, that we
purposely play certain
things. But that’s untrue. It‘s
just students doing their
own shows.

AE: One last thing I got
to know - are the
station’s call letters
KDIC purposely offen-
sive?

BC: Yes, definitely.

New art display includes
weavmgs, wood workings

PRESS RELEASE

Five Forest City artists are
being showcased in the
Grinnell Community Art
Gallery until October 10.
Artork includes paintings,
wood work, photographs,
and weavings.

Sharon Hadacek has lived
in Forest City for 23 years.
Sharon began painting with
acrylic, then oil and for the
last four years has worked
exclusively in watercolor.
She is employed at Voss Me-
morial Library as a book
preservation librarian.

Stanford Holtan, 74, has
been interested in “wood"
since manual training in
Hanlontown High School,
but for many years wood
work was limited to his own
home remodeling and other
farm construction. For four
years Stan has been part of

the staff of Waldorf Wood-
carving Weekend. He has
attended many seminars in
Decorah and the North Iowa
Woodcarvers of Titonka.

Julienne K. Friday works
with native hardwoods and
most of her creations are of
walnut, maple, cherry, ash,
and oak. Julienne describes
that she is intrigued by the
properties inherent in the
medium of wood and the
expression of its infinite
possibilities. She also feels
that the artist gives expres-
sion to what form the wood
will take.

David Damm describes
his photography style as
“documentary" and tries to
tell a story about people and
places. “I enjoy black and
white photographs because
people pay attention to the
patterns and shapes and the

different shades of gray.
Too often with color pho-
tography, the colors get in
the way of the photograph.
Black and white seems so
timeless and inviting."

Anne Anderson explains
that the rhythm of life and
the rhythm of the loom
work together as inspiration
and vehicle for her weaving.
The movement and ﬂow of
daily life in combination
with the texture and color
of fiber allows the creation
of pieces that have a char-
acter and life of their own,
much the same way a day
has color and life.

The Forest City Artists ex-
hibit will run from Septem-
ber 19 until October 10. A
reception will be held open-
ing day from 4:30 to 6:00
pm. .

WONDELFUL MoTHEl . ”Fort

Band. Any-
one who makes this mistake
is going to be sorely disap-
pointed. Directed and pro
duced by demented Dave
Cronenburg and based on
the book by 1.6. Ballard,
Crash focuses on the ele-
ments that typically make a
Hollywood blockbuster: sex
and car crashes. Sounds
simple, right? Not exactly.

The plot revolves around
James Ballard (James

Spader), a man spiraling,

into a world of automobile
eroticism after a near-fatal
car crash. Ballard meets
some very dark and twisted
characters along the way:
the widow of the man he
killed in his car accident
(Holly Hunter), a man so ob-
sessed with the history of
car accidents that he pub-
licly reenacts them (Elias
Koteas). He also meets a
whole host of creepies that
only come out at night when
there is heavy traffic on the
freeway. I’m sure you’re
wondering how the sex fits
into all the car wrecks. Ba-
sically, whenever it can: dur-
ing, after, or right before.
The characters all have one
thing in common — an in-
credible arousal relating to
cars and the split second
violence they are capable of.
These are people that the
phrase “let’s go for a ride”
holds a very special mean—
ing.

The previews indicated
that this movie had some
very erotic imagery, but
what is not evident until you
actually see the movie is the
rally screwed up undertones
to all of it. Make no mistake,
this/movie is not pornogra-
phy. It is a dark, graphic
portrayal of one man’s per-
spective of sex and technol-

ogy. The sex scenes are shot '

in mind, and I think that im»
pression is intended to dis-
turb even the most hard-
ened viewer. It does not
matter how open-minded
you are. The sight of two
people having sex and rub-
bing each other’s scars lov-
ingly should strike you as a
little bit odd.

The sex is full of imagery
about car crashes, and the
car scenes are full of imag-
ery pertaining to sex. Head-
on collisions, rear~ending,
and side-swiping, you may
begin to wonder just how
deeply rooted this sort of
thing is in our modern cul-
ture. These scenes are beau-
tifully choreographed, at
least when you take into
consideration the impres»
sions that the director is try-
ing to convey.

Luslsilytonthe actors; the
burden of this film lies in
the imagery. There isn’t
much actual dialogue in the
film, as the characters seem
a little busy having sex in
cars. What dialogue there
is isn‘t very deep, and most
of it is just to keep the
viewer from getting con-
fused about the sex and car
crashes. Also, I have one
problem with the delivery of
the lines in this film. Too
much whispering. lwas un-
able to make out many of
the lines, and this could be
one reason I am not im-
pressed with the acting.
Beyond the delivery of lines,
the job isn’t too difficult
with a pelvic thrust here,
licking of the scars there,
and so on.

I base my rating system off
of each individual movie, on
a four point scale. I don’t
see how stars have anything
to do with it, so each scale
is unique. One point is a
rental if everything else is
checked out, and hey, Har»
ris is free. Two points might
warrant a trip to the dollar
theater. Three points is
worth the price of admis-
sion, and four points means
I gladly paid to see it and it
disturbed the hell out of me.
For instance, is I was review-
ing the hit film Seven, it
would receive threeeanda-
half out of a possible four
heads in a box. So I give this
movie two out of four rear»
end collisions, because as
disturbing as it is, it does
leave some very interesting
questions on your mind in
the end.

punk as *$#%?
