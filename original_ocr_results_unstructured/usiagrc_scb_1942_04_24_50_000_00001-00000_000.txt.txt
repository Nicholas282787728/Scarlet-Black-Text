dents to accept leadership in thc
reconstruction period following the
war. Dr. Mabclle Blake, adviser
to colleges from the consumer
education department of OPA,
opened the Grinnell conference on

5&3 Corrects

Misinterpreted
Stevens ’ Quote

-A paragraph of interpretative
ncwswriting which preceded a di-
rect quote by Pres. Samuel N. Ste»
vcns in last Friday's Scarlet and
Eli: r resulted in placing- the em-
pliosis of the president's remarks
on a mistahcn idea.

The misinterpretation appeared
in the first column of the sec-
ond page and was part of the
first story dealing with the pror
posed abolition of Dibble ball. It
should have read:

“stcvcns claimed that the Sepe
aration of freshmen from the up-
per classmen would enable them
to Oriem; themselves better, and
that they would then identify
themselves as members of the
freshmen class and not as meme
hers of any specific hall.

“ ‘When this objective 1': BC-
compllshed, I will be satisfied,‘ the
Grinllell college president said."

Subsequent statements made by
the president have Shown that he
has no desire to wipe out the
hall affiliaion system, as was ini-
tially interpreted.

Crescendo Club Program

'Social Fraternity'

Charges that Friars, Senior

town men, and that the group
had fallen into the status of a

made last night by Reynolds

ization.

stitutlon asserts that members are

tions were being based on perso-
nal considerations.
