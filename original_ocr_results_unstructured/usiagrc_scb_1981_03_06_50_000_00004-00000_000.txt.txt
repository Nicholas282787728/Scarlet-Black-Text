The ligures ior black iaculty are lot-
selected years. The college has not in
creased in any year over the seven
black laculty members they had in
1271273. As a whole, these figures show
decline in black enrollment.

According to John Hopkins, director
of Admissions and Student Financial
Aid, when he came to Grinnell the goal
at the Admissrons Oiiice was to in-
crease the overall number oi applicants
and to increase minority enrollment.
Although the number of applicants has
increased by 30 percent the number ol
black students has not,

According to Hopkins. this downward
trend is due to [our main factors First.
"the tact that public consciousness is
not tocused on black issues in the same
way it was during the late 19605 and

. early 19705." Second, "in the past few
years local community schools at a non»
liberal arts nature have grown in inner
city areas, thereby attracting many
black Students " Third, "other colleges
are competing [or the same highly
qualitied black pool at students as Grinr
nell." Finally, "the tact that Grinnell is
located in lowa and only has a small
black community on campus
discourages many blacks from enroll
ing "

' n we late 1960s," Hopkins stated,
"when the Rockefeller Foundation
gave grants to colleges in an attempt to
increase black enrollment in colleges
around the country, Grinnell did a
disservice to many black students who
enrolled. We provided iinancial aid to
many unqualiiied students who did not

survive," He lurther stated, "The Ad
missions Oiiice tailed to provide
academic and cultural assistance loi'
these students.“

According to Hopkins, alter this
tailure to increase black enrollment
the Admissions Ollice has attempted to
"reverse the decline and increase the
diverSity oi the college." The oii’ice has
attempted to "develop a more personal
approach to the problem by going to
black churchcs, to admissions
counselors in urban areas and to black
alumni " Yet. generally, Hopkins views
“the problem as lrustrating and due
l’icult to solve.‘

Murray Jolivette, an Admissions
counselor and the minority and interna-
tional students recruiter, reiterated
many of Hopkins Viewpoints He
stated, "Grinnell has a dillicult time in
attracting minorities as a result at its
location in lowa, the competition oi
other schools and the lack of a black
population on campus.” Jollvette pro»
Vided the lollowing statistics about the
number of black students admitted and
enrolling at Grinnell:

1977 18
1978 14
1979 10
1980 7

"This year,‘ Jolivette said, "between
60 and 7t) blacks were admitted
Hopeiully, more blacks will enroll out
of this number admitted ”

Jolivette stated, "The only time Grins
nell had a large black population on
campus was during the Rockefeller
grant years ” since these years the
number has steadily declined. Jolivetle
believed that Grinnell can do better in
terms of recrumng blacks, "although,
considering the location of Grinnell,
having only 34 black students on cam-
pus now is not unrealist Never-
theless, he felt “the administration
should keep trying to get qualified
black students on campus."

From the administration's perspec-
live there is "hope tor an increase in
black enrollment next year,‘ Accorr
ding to President George Drake, ”The
decline is a mayor concern oi the
trustees who want Grinnell to become a
multi»raCIal institution." Although
Drake viewed the "Admissions Ofﬁce
as. tor many years, having gone in the
wrong direction, this year a more per
sonal approach is being tried. Letters
have been sent to black alumni res
questing their assistance With recruit
ment. Along with this the Admissions
(mice is reassessing its past policies. '

At the present time, Drake believed,
"The college is meeting the needs ol
black students " He does not agree that

the location at Urinnell is one oi the
prime lactors discouraging enrollment
but that the lack ol a signiﬁcant black
community is a negative iactor. Drake
is "guardedly optimistic about the
luture and tell, “that ll an uliort is
made the problem oi black enrollment
can be resolved. '

Waldo Walker. executive vict-
president or the college, stated, “in the
late i960s and early 1970s when black
consciousness-raising was high. tirin»
nell responded to the public concern to
educate minorities and Grinnell had a
high number ol black students during
these years. '

Today, however, with competition
lrom nonrliberal arts schools and im~
proved programs in black colleges
around the nation, Grinnell has diliicul-
ty in attracting black students. Walker
stated that Grinneli does have "an
obligation to cultural diversity because
at the many benefits at racial interan
tion. Walker wants a Viable black
community at Grinnell and is ops
timistic about the iuture. He believed.
"Grinnell has always, in the recent
past. shown concern ior black enroll
ment,‘ Finally, Walker indicated a
goal oi the college is "to have enough
black students so that seem] pressures
are reduced. thereby producing a hare
monious and diverse student body."

Speaking on another aspect oi the
problem. that ol the small black lacull)
at Grinnell. Catherine Frazer. dean ol
the faculty, said, "The geographic loca-
tions 01 Grinnell in a rural, midweslern
community along with the lack of a
local black population is unattractive to
many black professors with families."
Although Frazer stated that an attempt
is always made to hire culturally and
racially diverse individuals ior iacult)
positions, “we have no way of knowing.
due to equal access cla uses. whether an
applicant is black.

Frazer further smtes, "Grinnell is
not near a large city like Uberlin Col-
lege which is able to draw on a large
pool oi black applicants lrom the
Cleveland area." Frazer concluded
that increasing the black lacully posi-
tions is a gradual process.“

More encouragingly, the dean
described the Spelman exchange as a
new program designed "to promote
greater racial understanding between
Grinnell and an all black women's col»
lege in the Atlanta area Spelman Col-
lege. in Atlanta, (3a.. is an institution
lor black women and is the sister col-
lege oi the all black, male Morehouse
College. Founded in i381, Speiman was
the first college primarily devoted to
educating black women. Last year the
President oi Spelman, Donald M,
Stewart, agreed to the idea of semester
and yearrlong exchange programs in'
volving Grinnell and Spelman students
and faculty. Frazer emphasized, "The
