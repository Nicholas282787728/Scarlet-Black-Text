Ganja, vine, and jewels

by Robin Radespiel

In honor of Relays Weekend, this
week's films offer a wide variety of
entertainment, from political
satire to musical comedy._0nce
again, there is something for
everyone,

Reefer Madness 11936, 66 mins.)
is a wonderful period film that
explores the effects of “the uns
speakable scourg&the new drug
menace” on American life. In the
end, one senses the path leads
directly irom “marijuana to
madness."

THE FILM HAS some truly
memorable moments which in
clude the depiction of the nature of
marijuana ”highs,” and the types
of addiction that follow the first
inhalation of the “Devil Drug."

A line from the original ads
vertising says it best: “One
moment of Bliss: A Lifetime of
Regret. Hunting a thrill, they
inhaled a drag of concentrated
sin "

IN A MUCII different vein, Paint
Your Wagon 11969, 159 mins.) is a
musical comedy starring Lee
Marvin, Clint Eastwood. and Jean
Seberg. The ﬁlm was directed by
Joshua Logan South Pacific.
Camelot) based on a screenplay by
Alan .lay Lerner.

The lilm tells the story of a gold
mining boom town full of raucous,
rip-roaring men whose activities
are limited to boczing, brawling,
and seducing women. The film
centers on the relationship bet
ween two men, Ben (Marvin) and
Pardner (Eastwood), and the wife
they share iSeberg). The situation
lends itself easily to a lively but
oiten predictable musical comedy.

THE MOUSE THAT \Roarcd
H959, 83 mins.) is an entertaining
and effective political satire
directed by Jack Arnold tIt Came
Front Outer Space. The Incredible
Shrinking Man), based on the novel
by Leonard Wlbberley, The film
stars Peter Sellers in three roles
with supporting performances by
Jean Seberg and David Kossoff.

The storyline depicts the Grand
Duchy of Fenwick, in danger of
Iinancial ruin because its chief
export, Wine, has been replaced on
the world market by a cheap
California imitation, The Grand

VAN’S

Duchess Glorianna. knowing from
history that any nation defeated by
the United States is immediately
reconstructed in better shape than
helore, dispatches twenty archers
in chain mail to capture New York
and start the war.

THE FILM contains some biting
satire along with typical Peter
Sellers humor and should prove
appropriate entertainment for
Relays Weekend.

Don’t forget the Hitchcock film
To Catch a Thief (1957, ‘37 mins.),

to be shown tonight. The film stars
Cary Grant as an ex-jcwel thief
who must prove his innocence
when implicated in a . rash of
burglaries, Grace Kelly plays the
woman who loves him but believes
he is guilty.

This fast paced film is
heightened by eiiective per-
formances from the two stars and
witty dialogue full of double ens
trances. Hitchcock, once again,
proves his mastery of the art of
tilm making,

Drew third in marathon

Terry Drew became “leader of
the pack” in last weekend’s Drake
Relays. In his first attempt at the
26 mile marathon. Drew crossed
the finish line ahead of 557
exhausted runners.

Drew was clocked at two hours,
29 minutes, 46 seconds. He was
three minutes and four seconds
behind winner Don Helier and «16
seconds behind second place
finisher Mike Seaman.

Some so runners broke away
from the starting line ahead of
Drew. Continuing to pass other
contestants lhroughom the race. he
moved into fourth place with
three miles remain-ng 4nd iook
over third place about one quarter
mile from the finish line,

Both Drew and his coach, Bob
Pankey. were surprised with
Drew's time. Drew felt that the
combination of “excellent weather
and a good course helped improve
the race,"

Pankey said, ”Drew‘s ability to
want to train. and the fact that he's
been running 30400 miles a week
helped him keep his time below
three hours."

Pankey added, “If Drew con-
tinues to stay in training, and gains
the experience of another
marathon, he might have the time
standards to qualify for the
Olympic trials. The average
Olympic qualifying standard is We
hours and twenty minutes.
