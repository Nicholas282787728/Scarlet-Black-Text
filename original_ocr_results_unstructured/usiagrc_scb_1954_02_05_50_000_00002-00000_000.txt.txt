It’s neat to be clever. You can have so much fun.

It was enjoyable carting a $200 television set away
from the union and hiding it. chuckle.

It was amusing watching everyone look for it for near~
ly eight Weeks. Tee hee. 1

And it was certainly a riot letting the Social Calendar
committee buy a new one, when the old one wasn't really
stolen}; lﬁut was hidden for a joke. It only cost about $220.

‘(Graduates of Grinnell college have more than three
times as good a chance of being listed in "Whg'mWho in
America" as graduates of taxAsuppolted institutions in
Iowa” a publicity release says.

A pat on the back is a good Way to open a new semes—
ter. The figures, compiled by the book’s publishers and
furnished us by the public relations office, show that 96
Grinnellians are listed. The publishers compared that figure
with Grinnell‘s 1952-53 enrollment, and compared the same
sets of figures for the state's schools. ‘

By this method there was one Grinnellian listed for
each 11 enrolled, and one for each 36.43 in the state col<
leges and university, 50 actually we have a 3.31 to 1 edge.

The figures are gratifying. To the faculty and adminis-
tration they indicate some measure of success in education.
To the students they reaffirm the decision to attend college
here. Let’s hope they teach us all a third lesson: Keep it
that Way.

Saturday night at 3, Roger
Perry will present his experi-
mental production of “A Sleep
of Prisoners," by Christopher
Fry. The play may or may not
lay an egg in Herrick chapel.
If it does, it will not be the
fault of Perry or his cast, and
will be the most laudable egg
to be laid around here in some
time.

”A Sleep of Prisoners" cons
csrns foul- prisoners of war
locked in in church in enemy
territory. The action occurs
through a series or dreamsgn
which each prisoner demon:
stratcs his own inner response
to events, bringing the problems
at hinisclt and his fellow pris-
oners tel a spiritual plane. It is

and is ride with his intricate
and tricky use of words—from
which will come the main prob-

audience. The philosophymny

Perry’s production offers a
stimulating dramatic experience.

The cast is certainly the bent
balanced thnt Perry could have
chosen. Chuck Haynes, as Pri-
vate David King. gives what is
not only a powerrul and even
performance, but his best to

Stewart, as Private Peter A'blc,
