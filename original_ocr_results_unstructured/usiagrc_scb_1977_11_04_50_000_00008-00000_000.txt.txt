Grinnell College, along with the
Jewish Welfare Federation of Des
Moines and the towel Board for
Public , Programs in the
Humanities, recently sponsored a
conference in both Grinnell and
Des Moines entitled Ethnicity and
Urbauity: Jews and Cities.

One of the keynote speakers was
Irving Howe, professor of English
at the City University or New York.
Howe's professional achievements
span both political and literary
arenas as well as the historical
arena, which has earned him the
most fame in recent years.

‘AS AN editor of Dissent
Ma gazinc and frequent contributor
to it and other radical journals,
Howe remains a stalwart member
of the 01d Left school of politics,
which reached its peak oi power in
the l930's and 1940's. Howe was one

of the few individuals to remain
active and concerned during the
alltoo-silent Fifties and the rise of
McCarthyism, as Lillian Hellman
notes in her book Scoundrel Time.

In the 1960’s, Howe, along with
his friend and colleague Michael
Harrington, author of the land»
mark work on poverty entitled The
Other America. continued to
develop and refine the concept of
“democratic socialism."
Together, they edited the book The
Seventies: Problems and
Proposals. Other political books
Howe has either authored or edited
include steady Work: Essays in
the Politics of Democratic
Radicalismt 1953-66, The American
Communist Party: A Critical
History, (with Lewis Coser), The
Radical Imagination, The Radical
Papers. and The Basic Writings ot

Trotsky. His other interests are
foreshadowed in the work Politics
and The Novel. which couples his
lifelong interest in political action
and literary criticism.

As A professor of English, Howe
has also long been recognized as an
esteemed literary critic, apecially
of modern literature Yet his
broad- basedinterests are reflected
in titles such as Thomas Hardy,
William Faulkner Edith Wharton
and Sherwood Anderson. Along
with Eliezer Greenberg, Howe has
edited a number of anthologies of
Yiddish poetry, and literature. It
was his long standing interest in
Yiddish literature and culture that
eventually resulted in the massive
Work entitled World 0' Our
Fathers. Seven years of research
culminated in 1976 with the
publication of this epic describing

Burling Changes drawn

By Marikay Kameczurz

Preliminary plans {or the

renovation of Burling Library,
which seek to increase book space,
conserve energy and improve
studying conditions, have been
outlined by the college librarian,
Christopher McKee.
, The trustees’ buildings and.
grounds committee will be
presented with this plan tonight. In
approved, the .project will be
started within the next three to five
years.

Although the possibility of unr
foreseen future developments in
library services have not been
excluded, the Burling renovation is
based on the assumption that
Grinnell will remain an un»
dergraduate liberal arts college
serving approximately 1200
students.

One of Burling's problems is lack
of space for the book collection.
There are now 242,000 volumes,
excluding government documents,
in the library's collection and the
new plans will give it a stack
capacity of more than 400,000
volumes with government
documents also being excluded
from that total. The growth rate of
Burling would then amount to 8000
to 9000 volumes annually and these
plans would serve the colleges
library needs for the next 13 to 22
years

 

. increased efficiency

TO PROVIDE the necessary
space, changes will be made in the
library's layout, particularly on
the Main Level. The circulation
desk Will be moved to the east end
of the foyer and the catalog will be
located immediately ahead as one
enters the library.

The extension of the Mezzanine
Level 'north to the windows and
south over the study area will
provide more study Carrels. The
renovated Ground Level will have
its ceiling raised six inches,
allowing nine shelves instead of
seven,

ENERGY will be conserved
through recircuiting and by tur-
ning on fewer lights Utilization of
heat from the steam plant has also
been recommended.

Improving the studying en-
vironment is another important
goal in Burling's renovation so the
plans call for more comfortable
furnishings. These and a lower
noise level due to added carpeting
“1 heavy traffic areas should result
in what McKee calls an at
mosphere “conducive to con-
centrated study.”

ACCORDING to McKee, it would
be “financially and ecologically
irresponsible” to build an addition
to Burling’s present structure. A
more efficient use of space and the
in energy

saving could help recover the cost
of renovation, which is half that of
a new addition.

If the suggestion is adopted to
switch Burling‘s collection from
the Decimal system to the Library
of Congress classification, three
years could be added to the
renovated Burling by identifying
30,000 titles that could be discarded
or stored in a non-public area.
Those three years would make the
present structure viable until the
year 2000.

“the yourney oi the East European
Jews to American and the life they
found and made. ” It received
nearly universal critical acclaim
and was awarded the National
Book Award for that year, Howe’s
lecture at Grinnell stemmed
direcﬂy from this work and was
entitled “American Culture and
the East European Jewish lmr
migrant."

Howe began his lecture by
qualifying the traditional view of
the American melting pot with
respect to the American Jew. To
Howe, the preservation of a unique
Jewish identity and history, apart
from the mainstream of the
dominant society and culture,
forms the integral component of
the Jewish Will to survive amidst
an incredible history of per
secution. He sees this manifested
in a “shared burden of memory," a
haunting historical consciousness
of the Holocaust and the prior
history of anti-semitism.

This shared consciousness, at
least in part. colored the imr
n‘ligrationof the 1880’s and made it
distinct from all other ethnic group
migrations of the time, including
the Irish and Italians Although
virtually all were seeking a better
life, only the Jews were seeking lite
ltselt.

THUS. while some historians
have viewed the massive inﬂux of
East European Jews in the'late
nineteenth century as a “collective
utopian experiment,” Howe is
quick to dismiss this as
simultaneously too “grandiose and
too simple,” Yet, he concedes that
the migration was a product of
collective goals and personal in»
lerests. .-\s HOW: slated. ”The
Jews who migrated to America
were thinking of themselves first,
but they were thinking oi them
selves as Jews." However, he
claims that no other group was as
“eager to penetrate American
culture.” '

Ironically, Jews were to "retain
more cultural baggage" than any

 

other ethnic faction. These traps
pings of the past, components of
the Old World Culture, included
first and foremost the Yiddish
language and its poetry, theatre,
folklore and music. The magnitude
and urgency of the migration
meant that for perhaps the first
time, workers and intellectuals
were residing side by side, often
working together in the sweat-
shops. The cramped quarters on
the lower east side of New York
and the infusion of journalists,
writers, teachers and socialists
along with tailors, garment
workers and other factory laborers
gave rise to what has been labelled
the Golden Age of Yiddish culture.
The emphasis Was on verbal ex-
pression, and Howe noted that
Jews almost literally “talked their
way into Gentile society.”

DIALOGUE was coupled wind
the written word, however, and
translations of Chekhov, Turgenev
and others were readily available
in Yiddish. Socialist politics
dominated the garment industry
and other heavily Jewish labor
forces. This rich culture flowered
through the late nineteenth and
early twentieth century, It forced
the dominant American culture
and its Puritan desire to create a
New Jerusalem to acknowledge for
the first time the existence of an
alternative—a viable, ~ none ‘
Christian society

Yet, Howe compared this lntensc
culture to “a tightly coiled spring
that finally had to let go." It was
With nostalgia and regret that he
discussed the decline of the im»
'migrant culture on the lower east
side of New York and the west Side
of Chicago. According to Howe, the
death of much of the Immigrant
population residing in these areas,
marked the beginning of the end of
the immigrant society, He
cynically acknowledged the
existence of university programs
in Yiddish language and culture.
- AS to the future of the Jewish
community, Howe dismissed such
inquiries with a wave of the hand,
replying, “l'm not a prophet."
