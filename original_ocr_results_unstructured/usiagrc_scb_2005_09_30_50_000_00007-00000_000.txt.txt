Babushki i Dyevus

In Russia, almost every woman is either a
bahushlta (grandmother) or a dyctaishlta (girl).
Ifyou’re having dinner with some friends in
a cafe and wish to get the wartresses‘s anew
tion, be she 15 or 45
you call out a loud
an inquiring: “Dyer
vushka!?" ‘

It seems disre-
spcctful at first, but;
you quickly learn to '
take the dichotomy '
in stride, even if malcs r: can
be universally addressed with an a f r
fectionnte “molodoy chelovek" (young man),

Babushkas are recognizable on sight. They
are the women who ntakc you believe that
Russian females, no matter
how thin in their youth, are all
taken to a special, secret camp
in the mountains, where they
are fed ice cream and aphorisms
for three to five years.

A habushka may, at first
glance seem entirely harmless,
and incapable of doing any
thing more than feeding you a
great deal more than your stomach can carry.
Brit that image dissipates quickly after a day or
two in any Russian town or city.

Babuslikas, you quickly learn, art: the ones
to ask for dlrcctmnsitlicy know their way
around every street and alloy and, unlike young
pcople,wll.l novcr lead you astray to. n laugh,

St. Petersburg is
widely known to

students in dire need with fltcdtrust I was told
that another calmly knocked down her front
door with an axe after it had accidentally been
' locked from the outside.

seems to me so far to be

be just as soon as I can keep up with the quick
clip at which all people seem to spcalt here.

Traveling in Russia has frustrations and
dangcrs that chart ottcn occur in other Euro
pean countries, not the least of which being
that they have a dang triclot language. which
I’m meant to be speaking all the time. I often
find myself comparing my experiences here
with those offriends who have U‘JVClCd abroad
in England, India or AirtentProvence.

Yes, they also had their supply of cultural
confusion, pickpockets and starving street
brats. But the absolute exhausting tact or
language immersion in a country where you
are not ﬂuent upon arrival (not to knock the
Gririnell Russian department, which has cer-
tainly prepared me better than some of my
current contemporaries from other instink
tions) trumps pretty much all other concerns.

Any expression ofsclf, anything i find t‘un-
ny or touching or noteworthy is bound to he
less intercsting after being laboriously thought
out and articulated like a third-giadcr. or you
could end up lrkc my friend Carolyn: she also
speaks Polish, and, mixing the two languages
in her head, repeatedly and enthusiastically
asked her host mother to rake her to a crypt
(she meant “storc").

Of course, mistakes like that an: the best
and most amusing way to learn, a fact which
1 fully appreciate. After all, I will now always
remember that should 1 want to go somewhere
and contemplate the dead. I only need ask to
be shown to a sklycp.

editorial

Promoting
dialogue

Earlier this week, SGA sent a ﬂier
through the mail to every student 'on cam»
pus with a picture of a rniscrly old man
counting gold coins and the words, Think
1}»: tr tuba/3 luf wing will] 21;: rely/ml} Mr
detriment? The 'er proceeded to encour-
age students to attend yesterday’s rtustees’
presentation an endowment spending.

The issue at hand is not whether the
trustees are herding our ever-increasing
tuition dollars Like the Christmas Cat—
olesque man on the flier. Maybe they are
and maybe they aren’t. Th'e prohlcm is,
students don‘t know, The S 63‘ B applauds
the trustees and SGA for organizing the
informational event; it is the ﬁrst in a long
line of steps required to gain the trust of
students and to create the sort of relation-
ship that should exist between the mains
tainers of this great institution and those
that call it home for four years.

Students, fairly or not, perceive the
trustees as uncaring and/or unknowledge—
able about: the issues facing them. (Per-
haps if they subscribed to these illustrious
pages, they would understand the issues

facing Grinr
neilians, but
not a single
trusts, and
most are
alumni, subs
scribes to the
s 83.)

T h C
Board of
Trustees is a
faceless en-
tity for most

students on
campus. They
come to Grinnell as a group three times a
year to essentially vote on financial issues
and sign some papers. MOS! don't interact
with students except for .\ select few that
are sent to short meetings in the Forum.

Last spring, hundreds ofstudents pro-
testcd outside the trustees‘ meeting even
as they agreed to increase tuition again.
The students protesting felt that their
legitimate issues and interests were be-
ing ignored. Again, maybe they were and
maybe they weren’t, An important fact:
college students don’t know how to run a
college. We need people like Warren Buf-
fett to keep this place aﬂoat. But when
trustees aren’t willing to give students’
concerns a fair hearing, students feel like
tnistces don't care about them. And per—
ceprion becomes reality.

The point of this editorialisn'r to blame
the trustees (entirely) for their abenarion
from students.Wheri the trustees do come
to talk to students, a pathetically small
numhcr of students usually show tip. Wc
write to encourage a stronger relationship
between the two groups. Trustees should
come to campus more often and students
should show up. Contact information for
trustees should be online so students can
send comments. A student representa-
tive should be placed on the Board. Much
more can be done. We look forward to the
day when we rcccive ﬂiers that have smilr
ing trustees and students with puppies and
rainbows and other good things.

And for any trustees who happen
to be reading this on their visit, e—inail

We need people like

feel like trustees don’t tare
about them,
