Once upon a time (they all

on a lonely rock on one of the
battlefronts.

This warrior, like all f‘lean»cut,

lection of pin-up girls. All night
‘when the mellow moon rose over
the rock, he would sit and gaze
at his pin-up girls( while he qui—
etly gnawed the laces off his G.
1. shoes) and yearn for the day
when he could rcturh.to the U.
s. and find a clean-cut American
girl for his mate.

Came the day. The soldier
found himself in civilian clothes
with a little gold pin in his la-
.pcl. He was now a veteran.
lsince he had heard that college
girls were the cleanest-cut, rede
dest-blooded American gals in
the country, off to college he
went:

The first thing he saw was
a group of little pixie women, all
iclad in fadcd blue overalls; but,
[thinking that they were merely
visiting war-workers, he went
blithely on in his search for a
mate.

Soon, to his horror, he discov-
cd that these wee, strange, jean-
clad creatures WERE college
girls. oIn shock and desperation,
he consulted a kindly wizard
(sometimes called a professor)
for advice; but to no avail.
Where.
of his dreams?

The disillusioned vet pondered
till his brain churned, and final:
ly reached a conclusion. So-o-o,
he packed his collection of pi
up girls and signed up for an»
other hitch in the service.

.And now dearies, good night
