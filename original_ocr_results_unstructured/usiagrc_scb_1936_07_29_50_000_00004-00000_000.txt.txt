\VHY COLLEGE?

Within a month and a half the doors of college will open to
welcome another year into the long record of educational history.
What is a college education?

it should be the purpose of all education to broaden minds and
to cultivate a zeal for knowledge, More specifically, it should lead
students to a technique of unifying all knowledge into a design for
living.

college is neither an educational factory, nor an ageing vault.
It is a community of men and women gathered together with the
teachers as leaders toward the goal of Self development.

As partners in this enterprise, what have we students to offer;
what have we a right to expect? We make a cash investment,
and we invest four of the most precious years of our lives.

We enter college as clumsy, awkward freshmen, but each one
of us is composed of materials of infinite possibility. Yet some
or! us will graduate with little perceptible growth in a philosophy
of life or reasoning power.

College is a matter of what we emphasize so we should use
discrimination in our selections, selecting those subjects, and hab-
its and friends that will give integration to our personalities, and
eliminating those things which do not contribute to our personal
efficiency and growth.

our aim would then be careful proportionate growthihehlth
of mind, body, and attitude. We would work hard and play‘hard,
and be inspired by our interests; urged on as we hate the joy ot
discovery, and thrilled by the promise of the future. .

LET'S LEARN ABOUT OURSELvm
(Purdue Exponent)

The results of a survey published in the New York Times Maga-
zine deals with the leisure hours. According to this research, the
typical college student in the typical Mid-western university has 42
hours at spare time a week, and this is spent in divers, mostly un~
profitable, ways.

Approximately one-third of this time is used in “bull sessions",
listening to the radio, driving, drinking, or ing in an automobile,
and dancing. One-third is spent in card-playing, and in other non»
athletic games, reading newspapers, magazines, and light fiction.
The remaining third is passed at motion pictures, more athletic
sports, including swimming and hiking. drinking, singing or playing-
some musical instrument, sleeping, and just looting.

"Bull sessions" occupy 5 hours each week and are second only
to reading which leads with 6 hours weekly. The subjects included
in these "safetyrvalve" discussions range from classes and instrllcs
’tor to the everlasting theme of sex. Between these comc sports,
religion, dates, and the latest college scandals.

Dancmg tops all other forms oi activity occurring on dates in
the point of time, the average student spending 32,; hours per week
on this diversion. Cal - ilaying and ping-pong or billiards take up
2 hours a week, and l toning- to the radio consumes about 31/, hours
Time spent in drinking ran s relatively low with only 30 minutes
weekly.

Only 36 percent of the typical Midwestern students attend
lectures or, any kind. Concerts, plays, hobbies, debates, and are
scslc downward in interest from 3-1 to eight percent.

Another point brought out by the survey is that students having
one roommate l'zmk better scholasticollv than those who live by
themselves or those who live with two or more persons,

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DORIC

The Ed is painting on the cam-
pus thls summer, and since we
don't take any papers all I know
is what I hear on the paint crew.
The main wits among the painters
are Dolph Ewart. Les Duke, (Mr.
G. Lester Duke in the winter)
Abe Singer, McNasty, Jim Davis
and Fred Luther. Jr. You can
easily see that this crew wouldn't
say anything very funny. Some
of their cracks are just fair. I'll
try to work them in.

The BIG News oi the sums
mer: Jim LhMasney, who has
been the greatest gcdnhout
known to this campus in
years, has finally settled down
and is keeping steady com-
pany with a girl, and surpris-
ingly a very nice girl. she
has the co»captzlin’s “a" pin
and is evidently trying to live
down the stigma of having
received the daisy lust Derby-
time.

There has been no hint of a
recurrence of the food strike of
last summer. In fact, the chuck
has been exceptionally good ever
since the fateful June day when
Louis the Fifth dropped in to the
counter unexpectedly and failed
miserably in an attempt to wress
tie a piece of allegedly roast beef
into submission.

r s .

You‘ll be surprised at the
appearance oi the campus.
Everything is n golden brown,
and camels have replaced, hor-
ses as beasts oi burden. Some
men are digging a ditch slop-
ing from the street to the
foundation base of cottages
mod and mince. We under-
stand this is a reservoir to
trap is quantity of water for
baths in case it should rain.
in case the moat docs fill
with water as intended, it will
make it mighty tough for a
second iloor gal to escape the
confines ot the Quad.

Late Gossip, very late, even
musty: Mary Unger is said to
have been married from February
on, and some of the lads are a bit
chagrined to think they have been
running around with a married
woman. And that Miner woman
has been Mrs. “Doc” Oliphant
since this time last summer. We
just mention those two cases to
show you that you can get away
with it in spite of stuff and
things.
