Disregarding what is known,
drawing what is seen

by Dan Capone

Currently on display in
Schaelfer Gallery (the hallway on
first floor of the Fine Arts build
ing. by Arena Theater) is a work
done by the students in Jill
Schril't's design class (Art 115),
The work, as it is hung now, is
the end result of a cooperative
project undertaken by the class in
order to develop visual acuity in
the perception of value (the rela-
tive degree of lightness or dark-
ness given to an area by the
amount of light reﬂected from it).

A photograph ("Dionysius in
Rhode Island" taken by Alan
Schrift and reshot by Jack
Robertson) was cut into twenty
small squares and each student
was given a square to grid out and
enlarge. As the students had not
seen the photo before it was cut
up. they had no context in which
to place their squares, and no
framework to rely on in
reproducing them. They had to
recognize and reproduce the val-
ues as closely as possible. When

the individual sections were
completed, they were pieced to-
gether and the students saw for
the first time what they had cor
operatively created.

The ﬁnished product is a re
markably coherent and consistent
reproduction of the original pho-
tograph: but it is also an
interesting study in value contrast
in itself. Schrit‘t attributes the
success of the project to the en-
thusiasm of her students and the
strong light-dark contrasts of the
original photograph, Ultimately,
Schrift says, "the lesson here is
that one should draw by what you
see and not by what you know."

The student work and the orig-
inal photograph will be on dis-
play through falI break.

L A N D S C A P E I N
IOWA: Prints, Drawings, and
Paintings by Virginia A. Myers,
Professor of Printmaking, School
of Art and Art History.
University of Iowa. Through
September 28th in the Print and
Drawing Study Room, lower
level of Burling Library. Open
Sunday through Friday 1:00 -
5:00, closed Saturdays The title
of the show, while adequate, does
not fully convey the nature of the
works. The images are not the
static images the title leads you
to expect. Rather than trying to
capture the appearance of the
Iowa landscape, Myers attempts
to communicate the experience of
the landscape and explore the
intangible dimensions of human
experience. See September 2nd
review.
