§INCE the prayer meetings of bile
various classes meet tonight for
the ﬁrst time we feel than a word of
explanation to newstudents Will not
come in amiss and incidentally may
apply to some older ones. The term
is rightly applied to these class gamer»
ings but to Studenhs il’; implies much
more than its ordinary signiﬁcance.
Although the primary motive of the
meeringsis a religious one and no
other element enters directly into
them. yet there is a deep inﬂuence
which may be felt by everyone wheth-
er the spiritual aspeci. appeals to him
or not. The acbive, leading class
members are the ones who appreciate
the value and beauty oi the prayer
meeting. Around this weihly gather
ingis builb up the real class Spirit.
which is the recruiting station for
than broader and deeper thing We call
Grinnell spirit.

UR football coach is here and hard
at. work. A squad oi thirty-ﬁve
men is putting in ins best he ks
in an endeavour to secure places on
the ’Varslty of freshman team and
Trainer Fisher is doing his utmost to
put every man in the proper physical
condition to stand the strain of a
season’s work. There is just one other
element. needed to round out one
combination and to crown our foob-

ball efforts with success. This element‘

the student. body alone can supply.
