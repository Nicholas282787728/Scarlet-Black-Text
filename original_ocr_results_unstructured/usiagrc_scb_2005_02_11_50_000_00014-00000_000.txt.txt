The MEN'S AND WOMEN'S ULTIMATE FRISBEE teams trav—
elled to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras tournament Feb. 4-6
It is the only time during the season that the teams have the
opportunity to play national caliber teams such as UC Berkely
and Texas A&M. Also in attendance was Carleton College, the
second best team in the nation

Seventy»five college teams attended in addition to various
club teams from large cities. On Saturday, the women’s team
lost to Tulane University, but on Sunday came back to beat
them, holding Tulane without a score They also played ”strip
point," meaning that every time a player catches the Frisbee,
they have to take off an article of clothing.

"Tulane was fun to play with because they/re as chill as we
are," captain LEXI ABEL /0 said. "Everyone made it to Burn
boun Street and it was deﬁ tely worth the long car ride"

The women’s team made it to the ﬁnals in the B bracket,
but fell to Rice University. Twenty-eight team members car-
oaoled tn the tournament, enduring a 15 hour car ride, but re—
vived themselves on Bourbon Street when they weren't playing
