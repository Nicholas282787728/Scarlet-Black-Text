Van Nostrand
Revitalizes

Consumer

Protection

by Steve Grow

As Chairman oi the lawn Commerce Com—
mission (ICC) Maurice Van Nostrand heads
one of the most impel-Lint state regulatory
agencies The commission. one of the oldest
in state government. must approve any rate
changes hy railroads. motor transportation
companies, grain storage warehouses. and
utilities companies Although its decisions
can be appealed through the courts, the come
mission can largely determine whether
Iowans pay a lair price tor thesi: important
services

Commission ollices occupy several doors
of an otiice building in downtown Des Moilies,
The three Commissioner the Executive
Secretary. and one other oiiicei‘ are all
appointed by the Governor, hut the Commis
sion has a sizable stall OI specialists and
secretaries in each of the areas in Much it
has responsillilltles. All those other cin-
ployees are under the merit system.

Mr. Van Nostrand told the SKiE that the ICC
can eitectively protect the consumer it it
exercises its rather extensive powers He
explained that, in theory at least. the stall
oi the ICC tries to make the best possible
case against the company which has applied
tor a rate increase The company and the
commission stat! argue their cases iliﬁilleﬂi”
ing before the three-man commission The
commission then decides What, it any, rate
increase it will allow
He feels that the threerlnan Commission
can remain free from undue political ins
ilttence as long as both political parties are
represented as Commissioners Any one ol
them could trike an issue to the press it he
tell it necessary
Since the stall is under the supervision oI
the Commissioners and the Executive SOCIO—
tary, it is possible tor the appointees to
prevent the effective Operation ol the ICC
Van Nostrand pointed out that this is exactly
what was happening helore he was appointed
to the commission last summer. At tllat time.
“great power was vested in the Executive
Secretary," a man named storey, who was
able to prevent action on several cases
During the preceding eight yet '5 the lCC
had decided only olie Case in its Utilities
Division, and there Was Ct liacklog 0H4 cases
Storey is no longer with the Commission

"Money was no prohlem," said Van Nose
trand, ”since much of the cost (lithe hearings
is paid by the company involved." The last
Commission Just ditln’t handle the cases "
This did not hurt the utilities Companies
because under lowa law they are .illouetl to
increase rates pending an ICC decision, it
they guarantee that they ltill return] any
Iiinds which tliC eventual ICC vtttC decision
does not allon‘

said that the two are *lar superior to airy

longer have to spend as much tiliic as tiCIUIC
helping the Utilities Division still to prepare
cases and that ion er outside consultants will
have to he hired in the future, This tiSClll
year the ICC Utilitv Division siiCiIl almost

There is some douht, however, whether
Van Nostrand, who lids heen tilt-driving lorce

During the last legislative session he tired

AS expected, there was consider hle poli—
tical opposition to the hill. The Agiiculture
antl health Departments strongly opposed
heiiig relieved ol some cl their duties, and
otneclcd to "reorganization tor no reason
at all " The Farm Bureau and chemical
manuiacliircrs lohtried strongly against it
The trig sore point was the chemical tech-
nology commission According to Mark
Geddes, administrative assistant in the Agri—
culture Department, "the laim hurcau aird
manulacturers had good relationships with
the Agriculture Department They know where

- the department draws the line ’ Geddes said

the chemical technology review heard in his
department was two years old and had "Just
got going," Transier and reorganization ol
the department would destroy initiative and
momentum -lt might he two years or so
heloic it gets going," said Gedtles
Disagreement over inclusion ol chemical
technology into the department threw the bill
into a conierence comnlittce The problem
was resolved ny inserting tlIC chemical re
view hodi‘tl iiilo the enviionnlenidl agency
unchanged in etlect the hoard was attached
to the agency instead ol suhmitting it to
reorganization consistent with the other three
hoards. As a result it has nine mcmher-s
while the other three hoards have live mem-
hers. Tire moye keeps liaison intact helween
larm and mamilacliu-mg interests and the
already cstahlished chemical technology re
view hoard.

Dr Arnold ltecve, Secretary ol health, said
no appropriations tor the agency weregrauted

were made tor stall transler or hookkecping.
