Modern Motive Might

MOUNTAINS, miles and minutes give
way before electricity, the magic mo-
tive power. Properly applied, it drives giant
locomotives across the continental divide,
tows ocean liners through the Panama Canal,
01' propels huge ships.

Through good lighi,safe signals, and illumin-
ated highways, it is making travel better and
safer and also is increasing the usefulness of
transportation methods on land, sea or in

the air.

In short, electricity is revolutionizing trans-
portation, making it quicker, safer, more eco-
nomical and reliable in all sorts of weather.

And back of this development in electric
transportation, in generating and transmit-
ting apparatus as well as motive mechan-
isms, are the co—ordinated scientiﬁc, engi-

 

neering and manufacturing resources of the
General Electric Company, working to the
end that electricity may better

serve mankind.
