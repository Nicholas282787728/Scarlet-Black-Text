setback to the pro-choice cause.

“I don’tthink they should’ve tried
to have a national march six months
after the first one," said Mariah
Goodc. “I think they should‘ve tried
to concentrate on the state marches
more.”

Rashmi Dyal-Chand, core group
member ofGrinnell's Politically Ac—
tive Feminist Alliance, thc’organi-
zation which sponsored theGrinnell
trip, said that the 150 state rallies
held the same day were pan of

NOW’s stated purpose in promoting
a nationwide provchoice effort.

“The numbers didn‘t disappoint
me," she said “When you add all the
other cities that participated, there
were more than 300,000 people.”

Although local police and national
newspapers put the crowdat150,000
people, NOW estimated attendance
at over 300,000.

Corsponsors of the event included
NOW, theNational Abortion Rights
Action League, Planned Parenthood
and the Democratic National Com-
mittee.

AGAINST THE GRAIN

sionalhasasinglechildt Shedecides
that this child is hindering hércareer
advancement so she kills it Moral?

EnoughscenariosJets throwafew
hard facts into the fire.

Pregnancies that are the result of
rape or incest, cases in which the
mother‘s life or health is in danger,
cases where the mother is under 18
years old. and cases where the child
would be born with some serious
disability. all added together, ac
count for less than 10 percent of the
total abortions performed in the
United States each year. That figure,
by the way, is a little less than 10
times the number of people who
attended the pro-choice rally in
Washington last Sunday.

The number of abortions per—
formed,perday, is about three anda
half times the total enrollment of
Grinnell College.

Oh, and in case you hadn‘t heard
already, 40 percent of those obtain-
ing abortions are repeat customers.

But is that little blob of ﬂesh a
human being? The only way you can
really say it isn’t, is if you claim it
hasn‘t matured into humanity. It’s
just a vegetable, right? Well, if we
base humanity on your physical
development, you aren‘t fully hu-
man until your mideZO’S. If we base
it on your mental development, you
aren't fully human until your early
60's, when most people reach their

intellectual peak. For all intents and
purposes, a baby tltat has just been
born is in the same stage ofdevelop-
ment that he or she was five days
ago.

I pose the question topro—choicers.
“Ifnot atconception, when does life
begin?" When the baby is capable of

What about someone who is in a
coma hooked up to a lifcrsupport
system? Are they not a human life,
given that they will recover in a few
months?

But don’t forget about the adop-
tion crisis. White babies are scarce
whileblackbabiesareadimeadozen.
Are you aware of the fact that soci-
ologists‘ theories regarding interra-
cial families make it almost impos-
sible for a white couple to adopt a
non-white baby in most states? The
waiting lists for children are about
four years long at most adoption
agencies. The non-white baby sur-
plus is a manufactured problem.

I don‘t seek to ram my morality
down your throat My motivation is
to insure that the rights ofall human
beings are protected. I do not recog-
nize the right to kill an innocent
person, and the unborn child is the
very essence of innocence

EUROPE’S NEW ORDER

might not home had an idea, as was
done in Poland.

Economic change in the program
is outlined as ”converting to a so-
cialist planned economy oriented to
market conditions.” Gorbachev
wanted the West on Tuesday about
thinking they could “export capital-
ism" east. Which means that some
weird combination of capitalism and
communism might be underway.
Whetherthisispossible, and whether
the transition is viable, is something
economists are worrying aboutright
now. And each economist has his or
her own answer.

Pressure for change will have an
effect, especially grass-roots pres-

sure within East Germany. The
feared human resources and brain
drain to West Germany is not too
much of a threat now. Of those who
crossed intoWest Berlin since Thursr
day, 95 percent have voluntarily
retumed.Butdissatisfactionwiththe
rate of change could easily reverse
that, creating the possibility that
another exodus could prompt a re-
newal of restrictions.

Ultimately, it boils down to how
far the Communist Party is willing
to go in adapting to the new situ-
ation And the Party itself is torn and
confused over this question. In such
situations perhaps it is better to lay
hands off until change is threatened.

,Why interfere when the motivation

for change remains?

becauseIthinkit‘smorcinclusivein
terms of the way I‘m gearing the
minority affairsofftce," Wynn said
“It’s moreafﬁnning.WhatI’mtrying
to do is reach out to all ethnic minor-
ity students. I see myself as helping
the entire campus.”

Hester also said that the lack of
multicultural role models in the fac»
ulty and administration detracts from
Grinnell‘s attractiveness for minor-
itystudents. Black students surveyed
last year who decided not to enroll at
Grinnell said they “wanted to go to a
school with more black faculty.”

Several admirustrators and faculty
members noted that narrow job de-
scriptions have made it more diffi-
cult to hire multicultural faculty.
Qualiﬁed minorities exist but they
may not fit a specific job descrip-
tion. Depanmentscurrently hire most
faculty but division hiring was sug-
gested as a way to makejob descrip-
tions more ﬂexible

“With respect to multicultural
faculty we are weak. so we have to
be prepared to make adjustments in
job description," Drake said.

“I'm noticing this year a willing-

ness to bea little broadcrwith the job
descriptions."hesaid.“Thisislargely
in the hands of the faculty”

The faculty hired also inﬂuence
whcdter Grinnell will incorporate
multicultural perspectives into its
curriculum.

Most of the debate on the curricu-
lum centeredonwhethermulticultu-
ral material could be included in
existing classes.

College president George Drake
said he is unwilling to dictate the
content of classes to faculty mem-
bers.

“Academic freedoms are at issue
here," he said. “I am quite reluctant
to tell the faculty what they should
teach in the classroom."

“My estimate is that most of my
colleagues don'tknow how to make
their curriculum diverse," said as-
sistant professor Kesho Scott. “They
want to— they justdon’tknow how
to." ’

Bell said the sciences as well as
the social sciences and humanities
should acknowledge the contribu-
tions of multicultural peoples in their

 

staff and a crew of DJXSt

SandyMoffett,chairofthefaculty
and member of the curriculum re-
view committee, said he hoped that
the committee‘s proposed senior
seminar system would include a
multicultural perspective.

“We‘re very anxious that the sen-
ior seminars be broad-based and
diverse and multicultural perspec—
tives would be included in that,"
Moffett said. -

Ways in which the college can
expose all its students to a culturally
diverse community were also dis-
cussed.

Tom Crady. dean of student af-
fairs, said that the housing system is
designed so that every student will
live with different groups of people
over the course of four years.

"I’m not saying it’s a perfect sys-
tem," Crady said, "but it does pro
mote the appreciation of diversity."

Crady also addressed the Latina
student group’s suggestion that
people of Latino heritage be hired
for resident adviser posts next year.

“One of the things we placea great
deal of emphasis on is hiring a di-
verse staff to work with a diverse
student body," he said.
