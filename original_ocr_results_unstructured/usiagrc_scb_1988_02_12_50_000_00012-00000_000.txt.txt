At12130 F.M. last Friday, after a
hasty lunch at Cowles, the
women’s swim team, along with
the men’s. departed in two vans
and the minibus. Destination:
omaha, Nebraska. and ior approx
imately half of the women's team,
ultimate destination: Kearney,
Nebraska.

The meet at University oi
Nebraska at Omaha against
Creighton University began at s
P M. Diver Colleen Murphy had an
excellent perlormance, ialling
short of nationals qualification
score by only 13 points. Once
again, it was nice having a dual

meet with the men so each team
could cheer on the other.

The teams ate together at the
Country Kitchen Buffet in pictures-
que downtown Omaha, and we fill-
ed up an entire room. Everyone
was feeling pretty good from the
evenu oi the day, so to speak, and
the food wasn't bad either, As we
were having dessert, we heard the
manager’s voice over the PA
System, “We'd like to welcome the
Grinnell college swimmers who
are dining with us tonight; we
understand that you won this even

cheers (It aDDreclation from all of

The women's basketball teams
from Monmouth and Knox will in-

1:30 P.M. and Tuesday at 7 P.M.),

have caused in the Midwest

week, iear should be present in
these two conference toes. Certainr
ly, there is no longer any doubt that
the vastly improved Grinnell team
can beat any squad in the cone
{erence alter their play against
three teams that each triumphed
by nearly 20 points in their iirst
contests against the Pioneers,

The momentum generated by
the Pioneers victory over lowa
Wesleyan carried over to a Feb. 3
contest against the Cornell Rams,
the reigning conierence champs.
Playing on the home court at the
division leaders, the Pioneers turn-
ed in another of the hard-nosed ei-
torts which are becoming their
trademark, destroying the Rams
on the boards (37 to 23) and

‘ decisively outshooting their toes
, (47 percent to 35 percent) from the
ilield. The Pioneers took Cornell to

and by three with one minute leit.

Saturday‘s game at Darby was
not only triumphant, but also
historic. Trailing Illinois College
with a scant 35 seconds remaining,
Grinnell's hopes rested on Amy
Johnson's free throw; she co",
llected, and the game went into
overtime, Jubilation reigned dur-
ing the five-minute overtime
period as the Pioneers bombarded
the basket, scoring 16 points and
earning their iirst conference win
in yet another oi Darby's iamed
finishes. Once again, the nets were
ablaze as the Pioneers made an in
credible 53.6 percent oi their ﬁeld
goals. Mchmsey turned in another
oi her consistent periormances
with 13 points and eight rebounds
while the experienced backcourt
duo oi Becky Rate (11 points. ﬁve
boards) and Jessica Tait (six
points in overtime) set the pace for
the Pioneer victory. However, one
player’s eilorts made history
Saturday afternoon. The old school
record ior points in one game tor a
Grinnell layer was so until Laura
VanSickle played a game better
than any other woman in the
history or Grinnell College, Laura
scored 41 points and grabbed 20 re

gratulations are in order to Laura

Tuesday evening a
\vomen's»men's basketball
doubleheader took place in Darby.
One would think this would be a
great idea, by allowing members
oi a campus to support both teams
in one evening and so leaving an
extra weeknight iree. It must be
very disheartening ior student-
athletes at this institution to count
heads during a timeout late in a
very exciting women's basketball
game against Grinnell‘s biggest
(our ONLY) rival. Coe, and see one
1y 25 students there cheering for
the Pioneers, 1 mean, come on,
people, there were that many
iaculty members in attendance, In
case you haven’t caught the driit oi

this team plays exciting games.
Come see (or yourself! The lack of
crowd support undoubtedly hurt
the Pioneers in the waning minutes
