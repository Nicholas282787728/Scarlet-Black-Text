structor, is in charge.

Baker's theory as carried out at
Harvard in his 47 Workshop is being
iollowed consistently in this produc—
tion. Last night there was an ob-
served rehearsal, the results of which
were written up in critiques by the
members oi the class, These will form
the basis of criticism for the ﬁlm] re-
