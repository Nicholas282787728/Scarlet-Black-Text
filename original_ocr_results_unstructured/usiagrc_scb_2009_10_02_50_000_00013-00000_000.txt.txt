Wallace supports athletic community with tailgating

BY MARCUS EAGAN

Grinnell College is not the University of
Iowa, but there have always been a contin-
gent of tailgatcrs for football games, even
if they numbered in the single digits. Now
after a new policy by the Athletic Departs
ment, tailgating will hopefully be present
at every Grinnell sport from Basketball to
Volleyball.

Striking out on a road less traveled,Ath—
letic Director Greg Wallace announced at
the beginning of this year that the Athletic
Department is encouraging tailgating at all
athletic events Despite tailgating's nega-
tive reputation, Wallace hopes to build the
athletic and school spirit associated with
tailgating and he said that a pregame activ-
ity is a step in the right direction towards
improving the intercollegiate athletic~expe-
rience ofGrinnellians as a whole.

“It’s the fact that in a lot of cases, we’ve'

got students and parents that come from all
over the country," Wallace said. “The idea
is to help the patents more than anything,
giving them a chance to meet other parents
outside of the game situation."

The football tailgating tradition at
Grinnell started three years ago, while Greg
Wallace was still the head coach ofthe foot—
ball team.

"The idea oftailgaring was not originally
the idea ofthe Athletic Department. It was
the idea of [football player] Jonathan Ant—
rim's ['09] father," said Nancy Baumgartner,

administrative assistant to Wallace. “[Mr.
Antrim] wanted to do anything he could
to help the football program become more
successful, He began approaching parents at
games and sending e-mails to all the parents
he could about this great tailgating event
that was happening every home game."

As a result of Mr. Antrim’s efforts and
Wallace's support, the tailgating trend is
spreading beyond its traditional sport of
football. The Athletic Department wants
every sport to be supported by tailgating,
even Golf. Although the events will be none
alcoholic, Wallace hopes that the presence
of parents and the larger Grinnell commu
nity will be the draw for students to attend.
These characteristics will also help the
Grinnell version of tailgating transcend the
usual image of a parking lot full of people,
beer and oversized-t’oam-fmgcrs before and
during football games.

“we will provide resources," Baumgart-
ner said, “And while we can’t buy the food,
we can certainly help parents [and students]
get started"

The Athletic Department pledges to
provide tables, chairs and a tent for tailgat-
ing events.The tailgaters will need to bring
their own food and nonalcoholic drinks.
However, the Student Athletic Committee
said they may develop an arrangement for
students to provide Pecard numbers so that
meal plans can pay for the food.

There are only a handful of small libs
eral arts colleges that regularly host a major

tailgating event The mission of Grinnell's
Athletic Department behind tailgating is
to provide a medium for parents to network
and build relationships and for the students
to provide those parents with a taste of
Grinnell's unique ambiance. -
The festivities won’t stop_once the outs
door sports season comes to a close, either.
indoor and winter sports will be included
as well. ‘
“The mother ofJodi Watt
kins [’09] hosted a post
game reception at the
end of last year's
women’s basket-
ball season,"
Baumgartner
said.
Even if it
might not nee,
essarily translate
into athletic suc-
cess, players on came
pus are just happy to
have the support.
“People should do
it more often," Tennis
player Lizzy Monte
gomery '11 said, al-
though she said the
drinks might be

too much tempta-
tion for her. “It’d
make me jealous,
I get

because

thirsty when I play tennis."

Students on campus are divided on the
idea of,tailgating every sporting event. Dar
vid opong-Wndee ’12 sees the tailgates as a
little excessive.

“I think that tailgating is traditionally
meant for football," Opong-Wadee said.
“The fact that our basketball team is our
most renowned team on campus allows for
people to tailgate at that. But who’s going

want to tailgate a volleyball game or a tens
nis match? It’s kind ofjust uncalled for
and unnecessary."

However, cross country rune
ner Alana Vogel ’12, although
she admits she might not
stay for the entire game or
meet, isjust happy tojoin in

the pre-game revelry.
“I’m all for [tailgating],
I‘m all about supporting
Grinncll athletics in any way,
shape or form," Vogel said.
“Tailgating is tailgating—I don’t

discriminate."
When asked whether or not the
materialization of tailgating will
increase the general win percentv
age of Grinnell’s athletic teams,
Wallace said, “I'm not nece
essarily sure about per-
formance, but the ath—
letes will certainly have
a pretty good feeling
before hand.”

Cross Country women confident despite meet’s glitches

BY EMlLv BAJET

Technical glitches ar Grinnell Women’s Cross Country
team’s meet at Augustana College this past weekend weren’t
enough to keep the them from performing their best and cone
tinuing their pursuit of the Conference Championship at the
end of the season.

The women ﬁnished 13th out of 21 teams last weekend,
behind conference foes Carroll College (9th) and Monmouth
College (11th) Truman State won the meet with the Univer
sity of Chicago coming in second. Leading the Pioneers in
scoring was Maja Gamble '11,who ﬁnished 45th.

“We were pleased with how things went, we feel that we
are progressing week by week and 1 believe that most everyone
ran their best times of the season," Head Coach Evelyn Freer
man said. However, determining how well everyone did was
difhcult because the golf cart used to lead the runners along
the course took a wrong turn and created a 5420 meter course
instead ofthe usual 6000 meters. Luckily, Freeman was able to
use a palate pace converter in order to ﬁgure out each runners
actual times. ‘

Not only did Augustana shorten the length of the course,
but the timing chip placed around a Leah Russell ’ll’s shoe

did not work and her score as the third Grinnell runner to
finish wasn't registered until days after the meet. In spite of
these mishaps, Freeman believes that her runners are where
they need to be in order to win Conference Championships
for the fifth time in the past six years.

“We placed better as a team than we looked on Friday, but
our main goal is to perform well at conference and up until last
year we had a string offour conference titles,” Freeman said.

Last season at the Midwest conference (MWC) Champie
onship, the Women's Cross Country team tied for third place
with St. Norbert College, placing behind Carroll and Cham-
pion Monmouth. Considering their finish at Augustana, Freer
man believes them to be “sitting in a very good spot,” she said.

“Last year was a little bit disappointing because we had
to deal with a lot of sickness and some injuries and they just
occurred at the wrong time," Freeman said “It was a little bit
disappointing to lose our strength"

Although illness was a large contributing factor to the
team's third place finish last year,Team Captain Nora Colter
'10 focuses on positive aspects ofthe season so fat and remains
eager to see what the team can do at conference

“It was really exciting how -we scored in relation to other

teams in our conference," Colter said,who placed 91st this past
weekend. “lust coming off otAugustana, we're really looking
forward to conference and we're hoping we’ll be able to win.
again."

Although Freeman still worries about the potential of ill
ness on her team, she has great belief in the high number of
strong runners to lead them to the Conference Championship.

“we don't have any superstar runners, we have a really large
group of excellent runners,which in a way is an advantage too
because they have each other and so no one is running by
themselves and we have enough people for back up," Freeman
said.“Because we are so deep we can afford it more than other
schools could."

The Skull Crushers, as the team calls itself, has two more
opportunities to race before Conference Championships. The
meets will be held at Wartburg College in Waverly, IA on Oct,
10 and in Oshkosh, Wis on Oct. 17, where a majority of the
teams in the Midwest Conference will be running

"Oshkosh is the meet to get into the right mindset for,
and will reinforce the idea that we do have a lot of talent on
this team,"GambIe saidfOnce we hopefully get into the right
mindset, we could take conference,"
