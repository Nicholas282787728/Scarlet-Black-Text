rounded by some of the richest
farmland in the country, Grinnell
is a prime location to increase the
awareness ofviabte alternatives to
destructive farm practices.

To both environmentalists and
farmers the impact or monocrop
farming, the predominant agriculr
tural method in the United States,
has become an issue of concern.
Monocropping, the planting of an-
nual grain crops uniformly in a
field, depletes finite fossil fuels
and contaminates soil and water.
This method depends on mecha-

SGA restructuring

ago), the rest being regional
bands. In addition. only one
attempt was made at breaking
from the self-imposed mold of
dance bands and that was an un-
known jazz pcrformer who was
scheduled merely for the purpose
of parents‘ weekend. The
program of the fall of 1987
included two jazz and one
classical concert to complement
its series of more danceable
bands. Incidentally. the Ronald
Shannon Jackson concert which
was presented this past month
was also a repeat of a Ms, Dentel
booking,

It would be a mistake to
merely blame the concert and
film chairs for the shift in
programming, as it is evident
that this change in format is
largely a result of the
restructuring of the system and
most specifically the “firing" of
Ms. Dentel. Ms. Dentcl's record
speaks for itself and behind that
record lies a philosophy that
strived for diversity. Allegedly
Grinnell is a place in which one
can grow academically,
intellectually, and culturally.
With the one-sided offerings from
both the Films and Concerts
Committees the student body is
merely being fed a stiﬂing second
helping of leftoversr
Unfortunately SGA believes they
have done a “very successful“ job
in bringing entertainment to the
students, Of course, this analysis
was offered by one of the
architects of the system It is
clear that this anti-intellectual,
mainstream programming goes
against virtually everything this
institution stands for, However,
this is exactly the type of
programming SGA intends to
present. It is new the time to
correct this gross and blatant
mistake and use the wonderful
resources that Ms. Dentel
provides through her expertise,

assuming of course that she
would consider returning to an
organization that without
provocation treated her with
absolutely no respocL

Currently Ms. Dentel works
on the Performing Arts Film
Series, Public Events
Committee, and with special-
interest student groups;
struggling to bring a sense of
diversity to campus with an
extremely limited budget.
Among the results of her
endeavors this year include the
Count Basie Band, Robert “One
Man“ Johnson, and the Assad
Brothers. Additionally, she is
responsible for the Wednesday
Night Film Series which has
clearly shown the most diverse
and inspired selection of films
this year, including the Sinking
Creek Film Festival. Oddly.
Rob Killion was quoted in last
week's Scarlet and Black saying.
“I am very pleased with the
selections the films committee
has made, particularly because
there are more culturally en- .
richtng films being scheduled on
Wednesday nigth." Regardless or
Mr. Killion’s implications, it is
obvious that SGA has nothing to
do with the Wednesday night
series, other than that they
provoked its conception due to
their failure to establish a rounded
program themselves. However,
what is more odd is that Mr.
Killion recognizes Ms, Dentel’s
work as superior, yet played a
key role in her “firing."

For the last semester and a
half the student body has suffered
through this misdirected and
ultimately senseless program that
was pushed through SGA last
spring. However, the architects
of the new system are not fully
to blame, either, for the gas that e
propelled this political machine
is the apathy of our student body
