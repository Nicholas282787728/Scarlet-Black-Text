Search Continues
for FAO Director

By Aida Ruilova

ECAUSE his financial aid
B package was insufficient.

Nathan Foreman had no
choice but to leave Grinnell this
semester.

“Nathan and I felt the Financial
Aid Office (FAO) acted irresponsi-
bly," said Bill Mabon, Foreman’s
formerroommate. Foreman ’s father’s
employment status had changed but
not,Mabon said,inasignificantman-
ner. Foreman was notnotified of the
changes in his financial aid package
until roughly two weeks before the
start of the fall semester. He is cur-
rently out of school, working, with
the hopes of returning to Grinnell.

James Lincoln, the former direcr
tor of Financial Aid, was promoted
lastMay to thepositionofVicePresi-
dent of Enrollment. Since then, the
FAO has operated without a penna-
nent director.

“The office needs a director of
Financial Aid. It needs two adminis-
trative positions because there's a lot
ofwork,” said Gretchen Zimmerman,
acting director of the FAO. Since
Lincoln’s promotion, Zimmerman

has had to work double»duty.

“We’re doing the best that we
can,"Zimmerrnan said. “It has caused,
in some cases, a slower turnaround."

Asearch forapennanent director
ended last November with nonebeing
hired. A new search continues today.

“Whatwe’re trying to do is find
the bestpossiblc person for Grinnell
who can best serve the needs of
students. I decided to reopen the
search to assure that we got that."
Lincoln said.

Financial aid is a messy process,
tosaytheleast.“Youare dealing with
money,people’s privatelives,as well
as [the difficult issue 01] people ask-
ing for money,“ said Lincoln. Unlike
most offices in Grinnell, the FAQ is
one of the few that has to say “no"
sometimes because of the nature of
the work it handles.

“In trying to beso many things to
somanypeople," said Lincoln,“[thcre
is always a risk that] mistakes hap-
pen.“ Employees of the FAQ "work
very hard" to make sure that these
mistakes do notoccur. Afterall, mis-
takes not only mean costs to the stu-
dent, but costs to the institution itself.

“Putting the cart before the horse”

As trustees decide whether to construct new theatre facilities,
doubts still linger about the strength of the department

Department‘s need for an additional

Ferguson and Dean Charles
Duke conceded that they could not
make any promises about the recom-

cess, but even when the French de-

“Wefeel likea new facility with-
out a corresponding expansion in
curriculum and in faculty and course
offerings is, in a sense, putting the

theatre major Brian Peebles.

Dean Duke said that the best that
he can do is to wait for the Executive
Council’s recommendations, “I have
aproposal in hand and itwill go to the
