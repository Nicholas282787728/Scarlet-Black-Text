Several days ago, in one or the pap—

in reference to a custom which had
been ldoptetl at one of the large um-

to bu used hereafter at all of their-

The custom seems to me to be sum-

he remembered that during the last
year societies dill sultcr greatly, cw-
ing to war conditions. But this is true
woth every organization connected
with the college. The literary soci—
eties have always been very active and
strong rivalry has not been lacking.

Now, i at in a law words. what are
the beneﬁts derived from literary soci-
eties? First, every person connected
with a society receives valuable and
fundamental training in aiding him to
become a master of his own mind. of
course one may say that Grinnell has
a good department in public speaking
where this art may be acquired. It is

the opportunity to put into practice
what he learns in the classroom. and
practice is the only method whereby
one will ever become an influential
speaker.

secondly, since each men's society
has a sister society, the social life is
always of great interest and import-
ance. If this side of college life is
lacking, as it is. would it not place a
great gap in Grinnell social lite by
eliminating these societies?

Third. the literary societies not only
mean much to “5 Willie we are in col-

after we get out of college. When we
think of Grinncll and what she has

and interesting incidents connected
with them.
