0 We Apologize.

Monday morning marked the beginning of a
new semeste . But that isn’t the only rea-
son that Monday should remain in our
minds this week. For that day saw the any
pearance of our president before the stu-
dent body, and the student body saw a man
still smiling and genial but obviously dish
appointed. The character and merit of his

remarks are worthy of notice.

To fully understand the underlying rea-
sons for his talk, we must think back a
month and a half when the plans for Gl‘ll‘k
nell’s new curriculum came before the SUP
dent body. The immediate reaction to the
major changes incorporated ill this plan
was one of alarm and even dismay. It was
not long, however, before a little thought
and reflection convinced most of the SUP
dents that this change was really a God-
send for Gl'illllell college and for us. We
were struck by Pres. Stevens’ Vision and
during in this plan, and eagerly sought out
the details that wollld give us an intelligent
understanding of its scope and aims.

But the fact remains that there were some
who were hostile to the plan from the first.
The hostility arose from those who were
either too lazy to learn the truth or who re»
belled at the thought that next year they
might actually have to exercise their minds.
The mere existence of such students in our
college is a reflection upon Grinnell. But
when, from stupidity, ignorance, or pure ill<
will, they deliberately tell prospective stu-
dents in their home towns halfltruths or
falsehoods about the New Grinnell, this is
tantamount to treason. If this represents
the true Grinnell spill't, then we would do
well to close our doors tomorrow.

It is certainly true that some of this mis-
understanding is due to administrative short—
comings ill presenting the plan to the stun
dent body. But the main burden of guilt
must be placed on the students, more specif-
ically on those few unwilling toycoopei‘ate.
We apologize, Pres. Stevens, for this small
minority. Once more, we express our faith
in you and in the Grinnell of the future.

To the Editor:

Gtmnell, home of the worst water
supply ever used by college stu—
dents, struck a new high Monr
day night when a combinntlon
odor of a glue factory and an
iceless fish-mart rose from the
basins nnd showers of the campus.

What good does it do for our
good Mr. Beatty to lecture on the
use of soups and showers when
one smells worse after the shower
than before—Who wants to go
on a date with a walking glue
factory?

“/2 are perfectly aware of the
fact that no organization can run
so perfectly that some mistakes
will not be made, but the prob-
lem of smelly and sometimes
dirty hot water has long been
an annual occurrence whenever
the weather warms up.

It is our impression that this
Water problem is caused by the
college using heated Arbor Lake
water when the condensed steam
supply runs low. When it gets too
bad they use city water, which,
of course, is hardibut we want
clean hard Water not soft stinky
slimy stuff that would kill a fish.
HOW ABOUT IT, DR. STEVENS?

To the editor:

I believe that you wlll agree with
me that Monday's basketball
game brought no credit for Grins
nell as far as being good hosts
are concerned. The game was
her fought anti Very hard to
offi late. The actions of out-
crowd, together with the slippery
floor, added to the difficulties of
the officials. As long as we have
to play basketball on the same
ﬂoor on which dances are held,
there isn‘t much we can do about
the floor. This is just a situation
which we must accept. do the
best We can, and hope ibis com-
blnation will not be necessary in
the future.

We should be able to do some—
thing about the conduct of our
crowd and I believe you can help
in this matter if you will devote
some space towards the cause of
good sportsmanship, I realize full
well that there are some reasons
why our crowd may be phrticulnr.
ly demonstrative, The fact this:
we are so close to the play and
can see and hear everything that
goes on makes it is strong comp-
liltion for everyone to be an affi-
cial.

It IS impossible to get, one»
peat to secure, officials who will
not make some mistakes. Basket-
ball IS a very hard game to
officiate, officials are human and
will have their bad nights. Never-
theless, this does not justify our
crowd to “boo” on decisions
against the home team. The of-
ficials we bring are approved by
both coaches. We have confidence
In their ability and integrity. We
ask them to work here and con~
sidec them our guests. Is it too
much to cxpect our crowd to be
good hosts? Constant disapproval
of their decisions adds to the
difficulty of their work.

Even more important is our
treatment of visiting teams and
couches. Win, lose, or draw we
WSIJIt them to leave Grillllell feel-
ing that they have been treated
as guestsana anxious to make
another visit to Our campus.

Dorothy Mielke Named
Fellowship Club President

At the last meeting of the Fel-
lowship Club ncw officers for the
rest of this year and Lhe first
semester of next ycur were elect-
ed, according to Mary Lambert,
retiring president. The new offi-
cers are: president, Dorothy
Mlelke; Vice president, Donald
Noyce: secretary-treasurer, Helen
Matthews.

During the meeting Mary Alice
Beck and Donald Noyce gave a
report on an Intel‘chllrch and In-
terstate conference they attended
in Napci-ville, Illinois, during
Christmas vacation, Miss Lambert
stated.

I am sure the boys competing
on our athletic teams ncc coach
on to take no unfajl' advantage
of the rules and to observe high
standards of sportsmanship. Mem-
bers of teams nnd spectators are
only humun and will make some
misthkcs. hilt this should be the
oxccpcion rather than the mic

Let's have Gl‘lnnell known for
courtesy and good sportsmanship.
It is perfectly possible to give all
we have to win and still observe
these standards. Any help you
can give iownrd attaining this
goal will be appreciated.

—G. Lester Duke

To the Editor:
The administration appreciates
the efforts which the hall and
collage residents are making to
reduce the consumption of elec-
Lricity on the Grinnell campus.
The continued thoughtfulness of
the students may result in the
doing away with the wattage
restrictions new in effect.
