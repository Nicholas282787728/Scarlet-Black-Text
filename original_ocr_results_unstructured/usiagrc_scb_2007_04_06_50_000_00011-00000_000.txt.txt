Japinga: Intramural
sports need funding,
full-time director

Interested in playing sports but not a member ofa varsity atlr
leric team? You came to the wrong college

While official Grinnell College athletic teams seem to have no
trouble securing sufficient funding every season, studcpts who do
not belong to a varsiry ream but wish to participate in intramurals
have to rely on a program currently hanging on for dear life.

The Director oflnrramurals position, currendy held by Assis-
tant Soccer Coach Nikki McLellan, is funded through an NCAA
grant designed to put more minorities and women into Athletic
Department positions. Mchllan told me that Grinnell has received
the grant for the past two years, but the department now has no
intention ofrenewnig it. With budget cuts looming in the Athletic
Department’s future, the intramural program is in a precarious posir
tion.

This is the perfect time to spend a small portion ofour mounds
of money and finally get intramurals away from the Athletic De~
partment and under the command of the Wellness Department.
Along with this would come a full-time Wellness Director position
designed to maintain both student and faculty wellness, with intrar
murals and club sports occupying a cal point ofthe positionThc
college administration has denied ' is plan, along with denying a
plan that would focus an Athletic Department position on intramu-
rals with decreased coaching responsibility. .

Keeping the program in the Athletic Deparrmcnr to be run
pnrtrtime by coaches will prevent it from improving because the
intramural employees must focus more on the sport that they coach
at the expense of intramurals. Last fall, confus' r reigned as flng
football. soccer and beach volleyball games were all marred by teams
or referees inexplicably nor showing up. A fullrtime director ofinr
tramurals might have prevented this, ensuring that student direc-
tors and iefeiees fulfilled their roles. ' e hchcllan docs consider
intramurals to be her primary respor lity. her commitmenr to rhe
women's soccer team prevented her from adequately addressing all
these difficulties herself.

McLellan’s predicament is no different than if any orhcr em-
ployee in the Athletic Dcparrmcnr held her position. Varsity sports
come first, meaning that intramurnls get whatever time, if any, re
mains. Right now, with coaching and recruiting duties taking up less
time in the soccer offseason, McLellan reports spending “between
30 and 40 hours a week" working on the upcoming baskcrball and
dodgeball leagues, and assured me that the logistics on her end such
as scheduling and obtaining referees will run smoothly. Imagine ifa
Grinnell employee could devote thar much time every week during
every athletic season!

Regrettably, imagining a successful intramural program is the
best any Grinncllian can do, According to Mchllan, “the Presir
dent has made it clear that there will be
no Director of lntramurals," instead asks ’ .
ing for more student involvement in the {
intramural process and essentially claims
ing that only students can improve the
program. Unfortunately, the adniinistrar
tion has‘ it backwards. Student participa—
tion would rise if intramurals were given
the proper attention by the college, and only a full time Director
of lntramurals can do that, Currently, the dodgebull league has at
least 12 teams cnrolletl, while the basketball league has 12 teams in
each diviSlon. Ifothel leagues could also receive 30-40 hours a week
oflVchcllan's attention,I have no doubt that leagucs' enrollments
would rise and prove that Grinncll can support a strong intramural
program.

nrrnrrcial worrics should not play a major role in the decision,

either. A Director of Intramurals could be an entry-level position
expected to turn over eveiy two or three yeais. The directors pres-
ence would provide rhc stability thar intramurals needs to win over
cynical students who have endured inntn
merable gaffes over the years. Need a team
but don’t have one‘ Scheduling difficulties?
Suggestions for new sports.> Want a struc-

vcnting mass confusion (this year's dodgeball

delay, for instance?) Find the intramural di-
rector, who will now have the time to answer

all ofthesc questions.

T s is all rampant optimism, ofcoursc. Unless the administrar
tion suddenly realizes the need for a Director ofIntrtimurlils or a
student initiative passes that the administration actually reads, the
intranuual program will continue to suffer. i guess rhc mes gc is
simple: ifyou want structured athletic competitron,organiec it your
selfor join n rcnl sports team. Or find a dilfei'ent college.

Baseball opens
conference play
this weekend at
Knox College

BV DAN I-IAltolN

April showers bring May flowers, but they ruin
the start of baseball season. Players and fans alike
were disappointed last weekend when Saturday’s
homeropener versus Monmouth was postponed to
Sunday, then postponed from Sunday to rhis coming
Monday.

Grinnell was able to get a game in lastThursday, a
thrilling 5,4 comeback win over William Penn Uni-

versity, the 17thrranked team in NAIA.

William Penn touched up starring itcher Gary
Kuhn Y09 for four runs in thejourth inning to take
a APO lead. Grinnell then cut the lead in half in the
borrom of the inning after a basesrloaded single by
Daniel Clark ’08 scored Ben Mendoza ’08 and Brett
Maloney'OQ.

Grinnell inched closer in the fifth, with Chad
Takabuki’lO lending offthe inning with a double. He
then stored on a single by second baseman Robbie
Uilsell ’08. '

While the offense worked to getbackin the game, .
rhe Pioneers’ bullpen stopped the Statesmcn offense
cold. Patrick Lyons '09 relieved Kahn in the fourth
and battled through three hits and two walks to pitch
2 1/3 scoreless innings.

First-year Chad Christoffand Michal Rosenbaum
'08 worked scoreless scvcnrh and eighth innings, re
spectively, sending the game into the bottom of the
ninth with the Pioneers down 4—3.

Takabuki once again started the offense, this time
by getting hir by a pirch. Unscu followed with n sine
glc to advance Taitabuki to second. Mendoza almost
ended the game in spectacular fashion with a long fly
ball that just missed clearing rhe fence.

Instead, the hit was good enough for a game-tying
RBI double. After Maloney took a walk,]ames Bird
'08 smacked a single down the right field line,scoring
Unsell for the winning run,

"I've done this so many times, it really ain’t no
thing at this point,” said Bird. The New Jersey na-
tive was referring to his three game-winning RBI last
season, including one against st. Norbert in lasr year’s
Midwest Conference tournament.

The win over William Penn pushed the Pioneers’
record to 9-6 afrer going 6-4 over spring Break in
Florida. The trip was one ofthe most successful for
Grinneu in recent years.

“We played much tougher competition this year,
and we won,” said Unsell, who was named Midwest
Conference Playei of the Week for his hot start in
Florida. Over the team’s first 12 gnmes,Unscll led the
league with a .545 batting average, driVing in eight
runs, scoring 11 and stealing ll bases in 11 attempts.

The Pioneers travel to Knox fol a doubleheader

Softball offense shines over break but defense, team struggles

. BV NATE LINDSEY

The Gtinnell College softball team is 2‘7 tin nonrconferr
ence play after participating in two earlyrseason tournaments.
Despite the sluggish start to the season, both in record and
the weather, the Pioneers are ready to take advantage of sun-
nier skies and the upcoming conference season,which begins a
week from tomorrow with the MWC Softball Classic.

“I think that most of the returning players, myselfincludr

, ed. were not mentally prepared to get so decisively beaten in a
couple ofour games," corcaptain Lee Anne Steinberg ’07 said.
“Normally we go about .500 on our spring Break trip."

Steinberg attributed part of the lack of preparation to the
inclement weather leading up to their spring break trip, The
team went from not being able to practice outdoors due to the
ice storm to the dry humid climate of the Tucson desert.

The Pioneers dropped their first four games on March 13
and 19 before bouncing back with two strong games against
Morrisville and North Central on the last day of the tournar
merit prior to the rain cancellations, Grinnell defeated More
risville 871 early lastWed. morning in a game where the team

committed no errors, as compared to the 17 committed in the
previous four games.

“I think that we were rusty to start, and as the tournament
went on we began ro find our how we wanted to play," Coach
Tom sonnichscn said.“I think the [tournamcnr] record showed
how we played, but not how we have the ability to plny"

Immediately following the Morris game, the Pioneers met
North Central where they fell behind 8~1 in the top of the
fouith inning but came back with a big five iun inning in the
bottom of the inning. In the bottom of the seventh, the Pio-
neers rallied again to trail 9710 when Tess Cohen '07 hit what
appeared to be a walkroffhomerun to end the game,

“The ball hit the top ofthe fence and bounced over, but the
ump made a quick call that the girl had touched the ball and
[knocked over the fence at the same time]," Sonnichsen said.

The tournament's special rule on knocked over fences re
sulting in a ground rule double sent the Pioneers into extrnrinr
nings where they eventually fell 14711. Against North Central,
DarcyWard '09 went 4—4 and knocked in four RBIs. Both Em—
ily l<olbe '07 and Emily Stewart ’08 also chipped in two RBIs.

In the Herce Invitational last weekend, the Pioneers won
their first game against Northwestern, but dropped their next
two games against Augustana Friday and UW .— Lacrosse Satr
urday. The team’s filial tournament game was rained out.

“Augustana came out aggressive on Friday and exploited
one of our weaknesses, defending the steal." Emily Stewart '08
stud. “We had nor practiced our defense in this area enough and
we lost quite a few iuns due to this weak spot.”

Stewart gained recognition for her performance during
the tournament, making the all-tournament ream along with
Ward.

“offensively I was very pleased at our abiliry ro produce
runs,” Stewart said. “From the top to the bottom of the batting
order, everyone has proven to be a confident, capable hitter.”

The Pioneers were scheduled to play Buena Vista Univer-
sity Tuesday in a doubleheader, bur the game was postponed
due to poor field conditionThe Pioneers have two more dour
bleheaders to polish their defense before they begin conference
play, beginning with tomorrow's games against the University
ofChicago.
