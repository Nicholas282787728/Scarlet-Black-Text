THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Numerous Course Changes Planned

The dropping of require
ments and many departments’
desire to provide more court
ses for nonrmajor have re-
sulted in a number of course
changes for next year. Ale
though the Spanish department
is planning the most extensive
changes by revising 80% ofits
offerings, many other depart-
ments are making less sub*
stantial changes.

Interviews with department
chairmen indimte that course
changes - - mainly new courses
planned ~- are frequently su-
ggested or at least approved
of by students in the depart-
ment. Changes for next year

include:
Psychology: Two sections of

General Psychology will be
offered first semester next
year. Mr. Tyler will offer a
section which will involve use
of a special classroom in
Goodnow which allows for im-
mediate recording and feed-
back of individual responses
by students to the instructor’s
questions. Tyler hasprepared
a number of slides with ques-
tions and multiple choice ans-
wers, for use in the class. He
hopes to make use ofthe feed-
back informationpossible with
the classroom set- up in tea chr
ing students.

The major General Psycho-
logy sectionwhichmay include
as many as 100 students, will
be taught by the department.
staff, with a good deal of help
from junior or senior majors
who will work with studentsas
tutors, and will possibly lead
discussion sections. Plans
have not been finalized for the
precise operation of this sec-
tion.

Tyler said therewillbemore
revisions in the Psychology
curriculum second semester
next year, dealing with second
courses in social and develop-
mental psychology, and semt
inars or special topics courr
ses.

English: Major British Wri-
ters, both poetry and narras
tive, will be dropped and re-
placed by a pair of new cour—

four new offerings in English
which should have strong ape
peal to non majors, chairman
James Kissane said.

The new English poetry and
fiction courses will differ
from Major BritishWriters by
not being chronological in pre
sentation, and by including
American as well as English
writers. A course “Literary
Problems” will be inttoduced
at the introductory level, and
it will change its emphasis
and content depending on the
instructor. The Shakespeare
offerings have been adjusted
to give more flexibility and
breadth of appeal, and they
will include a 200 level ”In“
troduction to Shakespeare"
next year.

English offerings next year
will also include a two gem,
ester sequence “Tradition of
English Literature", a basic
examination of English liter
ature from the beginning to
the present. Itis designedpri-
marily for and will be re-
quired of majors.

Biology: “Invertebrate Zoos
logy" will be dropped second
semester and “Entomology"
will be added. In addition, De—
partment Chairman Ken Che
ristiansen will be coordina-
tor of LEAP. Other faculty
members of LEAP will be
Robert Voertman (econo
mics), Luther Erickson (cher
mistry), James Hottois (pol-
itical science), and Granville
Smith (physics). Next semes-
ter LEAP will begin work on
the second half of its first
phase, dealing with specific
problems. Christiansen said
work will probably begin with
solid waste recycling.

Physics: Wayne Denny, der
partment chairman, said that
a new general education cour
rse on models will be offered
next year. The course, open
to nonrmajors, will examine
the nature of models in stud-
ies of students' interests. He
said that some courses may
be dropped, but that the tie»
partment is not yet sure.

lheater: james Reeder, ch-

ses, “Poetry in English",and airman ofthe department, said

"Fiction in English.” These
courses will be two of the

that there will be "a whole
new curriculum" in Theater

next year; Course offerings
are generally being revisedin
the direction of becoming
more realistic. The oldacting
and directing course, for ex-
ample, will become two new
courses, "Fundamentals of
Acting" and "Fundamentals
of Directing".

Four history courses will be
offered, three to be in a se-
quence covering Greek topres
sent times, The fourth course
will concern American Thea~
ter History. Che history
course will be offered each
semester, with the sequence
to repeat every two years.
A Theater practicum, carry-
ing one to three credits per
semester, will also be intro-
duced for students who partir
cipate in productions in major
positions.

Comparitive Literature: The
program name willbe changed
to ”General LiteraryStudies"
next year, indicatinga broads
ening of the department’s of-
ferings, chairman Brian Har-
ris said. Miss Noblewill offer
a special topics seminar on
"Paradoxes of Time, Space,
and Personality in the New
Writing of Latin America”,
and the specialtopics seminar
slot Will be open in the future
for many kinds of broad, in-
terdisciplinary studies. Gent
eral Literary Studies will
offer one other new course of
its own, Modern European
Drama.

MORE next week

by J. C. Labowitz

As I mentioned among other
things in this space lastweek,
I am presenting what I consi-
der will be the top issues that
will occupy minds aroundhere
next year, including some is
sues that really should have
been talked about this year if
not last year. In any case,
here are some things that you
can mark on your calendar as
top prospects for next year.

The top pick for topic ofsthe
year for next year is a tossup
between two perrenial favor-
ites, moneyand student power.

Musical Drama 'Faniasiicks’ Opens Tonight

the world in "The Fantastics." (Photo by John Rnwell)

"The Fantasticks,” the long
est running musical comedy in
the history of the American
theater, will be performed at
Roberts Theater tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:00 pm.

The Grinnell cast for theplay
will be Mark Ashcraft, Blake
Blakesley, David Gaines,
Mark Hamilton, Andy Hauser,
Ann—Janine Morey, Pam Sch-
alk, and Mark Siegfried.

Mrs. Betty Voertman will
direct the musical,Mr.James
Fudge will be music director,
Robin Cowen will be stage
manager, and M. Garner Pfis-
ter Will be the technical dire
ector.

“The Fantasticks", subtitt
led “a parable about love",
is the story ofa boy anda girl
as they are forced to go out
and learn about life, gaining
wisdom through experience.
The characters, as introduced
by a narrator in the opening
scene, are "a boy, a girl,
two fathers, and a wall.”

The musical was written in
1959, by Harvey Schmidt and
Tom Jones, especially for off
broadway. It immediately be-
came a hit in New York when
it opened May 3, 1960, and
many of its musical numbers,
including “Try to Rememr
ber", “Soon It’s Gonna Rain",
and ”I Can See It” have since
become very popular.

Professor William Albrecht a labor economist from the Univer-
sity of Iowa, spoke here Wednesday on “The Impact of Discrim-
ination on Blacks in the labor Market."

Exactly What 583 Issue Is This?

Student power has been pushed
at the students so many times
that I have no interest in both-
ering with it further, except to
say that 95% of the students
neither realize nor really (are
much about the fact that the
students have an amazingam~
ount of power, as a group and
individually. Further examp-
les can be found in $815 arti—

cles about pinball machines. I
do think that the new house
president electionsareaposis
tive step, and I wish them a
lot of luck.

Something of a sub-topic of
the above is the offtoampus
co-ops. I wish them luck as
well, because I feel that this
will definitely be the trend of
the future here, despite the
fact that the campus media has
essentially ignored their dEV’
elopment so far.

The other topic that I feel
will be right up there for num*
her one is money. No one has
to talk about problems here in
terms of million‘dollar defit
cits, etc., but not enough gen-
eral attention has been given
to the personal effects of the
money problem. People are
being forced to leave thisplacc
because of the cuts that are
being made in their financial
aid. What is more,atthe same
time that people like Mike Mos
gen are being forced to trans-
fer to Montana State because
of money, we are stillattemps
ting to get athletes to come
here by offering them consi-
derations on financial aid.
This obviously leads to the
question of the entire intern
collegiate athletic program
here. I do not feel that lam
qualified to speak objectively
on this, as I am currently
competing in intercollegiate
athletics, but the nature of
athletics here Will be discus
sed at length next year. The
entire question of the real
role of sports (enjoyment and
satisfaction for the people int
volved, representation of the
school, alumni gratification,

etc.) Will definitely be raised,
in terms of costs versus real
benefits.

LEAP also will be a bigis-
sue. It is already interesting
that the college is being dir-
eCtly influenced in its actions
by a course made up offaculty
and students being given col-
lege credit and money. The
college could also be con-
strued as possibly taking pol-
itical stands on this within a
college course on college pron
perty. How long will the col‘
lege let LEAP cost them
money in the name ofecology?
My pet college-LEAP con-
frontation will come when we
start talking about the junk
we have been dumping down
the Chem lab drains for years.
What do you think happens to
all those precipitates?

Other issUES that I hope will
make the top ten will be the
continuing battle for the For
um; the parking situation; the
social calendar (both quality
and quantity of events); the
eversrecurring pet problem;
the death of intramuralsaswe
know them; the conﬂict be
tween the people who persist
on tromping on grass and the
people who accept the side-
walks we have now and don’t
want any more (and who re-
cognize the general policyars
ound here of dealing with such
situations with concrete); and
lastly but not leastly, the twin
issues of the upcoming politi-
cal mmpaigns and the col-
lege’s positions combinedwith
the continuing economic situ—
ation that says Grinnell grads
can get neither jobs not grad
school positions.

On that note, I quote from
Bob Lebell '70, ”Good luck
and good hunting".

I would like to correct an
implication lonce made. Niche

Grinnell for free. Note to Ron
Medvin: Walter Washington is
