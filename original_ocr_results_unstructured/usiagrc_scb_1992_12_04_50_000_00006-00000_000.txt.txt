Baroque Orchestra and Grinnell
singers to perform Sunday

When J.S. Bach composed the
Brandenbcrg Concertos in the dark
old days of the early 1700s, before
MTV and stereo sound, live perfor-
mance was the only way to appreciate
music. The Baroque Orchestraof Iowa

to see and hear what Bach’s music
might have been like when it was
originally performed.

On Dec. 6, the Baroque Orches-
ua of Iowa will perform one of its
only two concerts this year, in
conjuction with the Grinnell Singers.
The program includes works by Bach,
Handel, Punto, and Haydn.

The Orchestra, which was
founded last year by John Stuhr-
Rommereim, assistant professor of
music, is the first professional pe-
riod»instrument ensemble based in
Iowa. The orchestra’s mission is to
bring ﬁrSLAClaSS performances of Ba-
roque music to Iowans.

“The impulse was to hear the
music the way it would have
sounded," said Stuhr-Rommereim,

who is the Orchestra‘s conductor and
harps:chordist. “The sound has a sil-

Period-instrument ensembles
have become increasingly popular
nationwide in recent years as music
lovers seek to rediscover how the
great compositions might have
soundedoriginally.Baroquccomposr
ers wrote music to suit the instru-
ments oftheir day, and many ofthose
instruments have changed Sigmfh
cantly over time. Playing techniques
have also changed dramatically.

To form the Baroque Orchestra
of Iowa, Stuhr-Rommereim has ate
tracted talented professionals who
teach throughout the Midwest and
specialize in Baroque performance
practice. While the core members are
professors from Grinnell and Iowa

from Chicago; Kansas City; Grand
Rapids; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and
Bloomington. Indiana.

Final preparations for the con-
cert will take place during two—andrar
