A‘N EDITORIAL in the S. U. l. Qm
speaking of the recent dual meet be-
tweelr Grinnell and the State Univer-
sity, says as follows: “At the ﬁeld
meet, last Saturday, it seemed as it
every man in Iowa College was on
the track team and every girl was olrt
showing lrer loyalty by her presence
and with her voice. There are about
.ﬁve hundred and ﬁfty students at
Grinllell, half of whom are women,
and yet she gives us good competition
in every contest with her." The above
tribute from a rival institutlon we inn
tel‘pret to nlean only a fresh recogni~
tion of the “Grinnell spirit” of llllited
and selfrsacrliicing work which has
marked our athletics during so many
years, and we cannot but feel tlrat
this recognition is wellrdeserved. The
mere fact that we lost the dual meet
this year should not be construed to
mean that we are doomed to continue
al defeat. In reality, the number of
men ill training, the interest marli-
tested by all the Students ill the work
or the track team, and, above all, the
number of men of the lower classes
who have made the team this year,
are all indications of victory in the
future. But what is moreto the point,
we must not permit Olll‘ spirit to flag
this year, Orl Friday the State Field
Meet,tlre culmination of the sprillg’athr
letic season among the colleges, will
be held at Des Moines. Glinnell will
be represented there by men who
have devoted their time alld energy
all through the spring with a view to
this one occasion. They have had
the best trainer in the state arid will
go to Des Moines ill the pink of con
dition and prepared to gather ill every
point which it is possible for them to
will. We can only urge that their
support be equal to that which they
have had in other years. Last year
we earned the name of being the
gamest‘ losers on the ground. This
year we are not fore-ordained to lose.
We have a fair chance to conre out
ahead, but will or lose, we ought to
see that our reputation as a college is
upheld. We know it will be by our
athletes on the track; we hope it will
be by the spectators ill the grand
stand. Every loyal Grinnell student
should feel it his duty to be present at
Des Moines on Friday and to do his
part in seeing that Iowa College is
well represented.

(Coulinrred troiii Frrsl Page.)
iSince the days of Greek philosophy
the world has been divided into two
classes—the one striving to eliminate
struggle from life and the other seeing
ill struggle the one source of progress.
Stritcless progress is impossible, Lite
is primarily a struggle. With Brown
ing we may say:

“Then welcome each rehutr

That makes lile's smoothness rough."

McKee followed with a plea for the
construction of the Nicaragua canal by
ollr government independently. Grier,
having for his subject ”l—‘oplllar Elec-
tiolr of Senators," was the last contest-
allt. l—Ie advocated the election of our
senators by popular ballot as a logical
Step ill the development of democratic
government, alld a remedy for many
at olrr present evils.

While the society waited for the de-
cision ot the judges, Professor John-
son spoke to all aspirants for success
in debating and the various branches
of society work, giving a word of most
excellent advice.

Mr. Parker being called for, gave
the younger members of the society
some of the conclusions drawn from
his experience in society work.

The award of the judges accorded
Meade ﬁrst place and Parker second.
Wylie was third, his average standing
only .03 behind Parker’s. A short
business session followed tlle literary
program.

Mistakes at the Dual Meet.

Owing to the fact that the distances
ill the shot-put and hammer throw at
the dual meet were measured from
the center of the circle instead of the
edge, 3% teetrnustbe subtracted tronr
the record made in each event. In the
shot-put, Warner’s record is reduced
from 37 feet. 5% inches, to 33 feet,
11y; inches, while his record in the
hammerrthrmv stands at 109 feet, 6
inches, instead of 113 feet.

The state record in the nrlle run,
which, on the program, was given to
Clyde of Gl‘inllell with4z45 3-5, real—
ly belonged to Wilson of the State
University, who, last spring, made the
dlstance ill 4:39 2-5, 6 1-5 seconds
faster than the time made by Clyde.
