GA

By RUPIN THAKKAR
SGA President

I would like to welcome you back
to campus and lo the new Student
Government Association column.
Over recent years, many have
questioned the power that the stu-
dent body and SGA have on our
campus.

Students asked if self»govemrince
was anything more than a buzz-
word to toss in the college admis»
sions literature. Now. however,
SGA is coming offa very success»
ful year of gathering and respond»
ing to student concerns. By help»
ing the administration recognize
weaknesses in certain facilities and
services, SGA facilitated upgrades
in campus safety, Harris Center fa-
cilities. and Dining Services. We
have seen that SGA can indeed be
a powerful institution on this cam»
pus.

We begin this school year know»
ing that meeting high goals means
building on the progress made last
year. By returning to campus eaily
for the ﬁrst ever Cabinet training.
the new Cabinet has begun to en~
sure this progress. Before the year
began we had already become a
strong teamwdetermined many of

 

our goals, and met with many ad-
ministrators to ensure open commit»
nieanon throughout the year.

The Cabinet has also discussed a
variety of methods in which SGA
can strengthen communication with
the student body. The newly»
formed Publicity Committee will
carry out many of these rcsponsi»
bilities while continually generating
new ideas on how to better promote
SGA We are very excited about this
column which will provide updates
about the issues being discussed in
Joint Board as well as more details
about each oflhe positions and com»
mittees that make up SGA, We Will
continue to update the bulletin board
in the post office, and we are creat-
ing a World Wide Web page. You
will be asked for feedback through
phone polls and, ofcourse, by your
Senators.

Finally, we are enthusiastic about
the newest addition to the Cabinet.
the Student Group Liaison/ Public-
ity Coordinator. In addition to
working with existing organizations
and assisting students establishing
new groups, she will also chair
Common Ground, a new commit»
tee dedicated to strengthening com-
munication between related organi-
zations and encouinging collabora»

“Ont

On Tuesday ‘eptember 10, clec»
tioits for thc inst semester Scnalois
Will be held. While the Cabinet sets
the direction and tone for SGA, it
is the Senators aild committee tnem»
bcrs who make the ultimate deci»
sions on issues.

The new stiucluie of the Joint
Board implemented last year allows
Senators to focus on gathering your
concerns and feedback to cast edu-
catcd votes, rather than simply rc-
cording minutcs and acting as a rub»
ber stamp.

Further, the Senators will play a
more active role in the Hall Couns
cils this year with the addition of a
scheduled time at each meeting to
discuss the Joint Board minutes and
agendas. If you are interested iti
soliciting concerns. proposing so»
lutions, and communicating
progress, we urge you to run for this
pOSIllOn.

Please stop by the SGA offices in
the basement ol‘the Forum Will] ally
questions or comments, or simply
to introduce yoursclt’. with your
input and involvement we will cons
tiiiuc to accomplish many goals and
make improvements on our campus.

Dreams Made Easy

By SCOTT ANDERSON

Reporter

Hi. I‘m going to be writing a com-
puter advice column about different
campus computing resources like
Dreams or MS Word for the semes»
ter. Often I’ll spend time complain»
ing about how bad or out of date the
resource is. and then explain how to
use it better.

Take Dreams, the program that
most students use to access their e»
mail. It is a fairly difﬁcult system to
use. go over to the MathLAN some-
time and type Elm or Pine at the com-
mand prompt.

They are both mum to use than
Dreams and manage large amounts
of e-mail better. But since Dreams
is all we‘ve got, that‘s what I’m goA
ing to try and explain today.

If you have any more questions that
I haven‘t answered, ask a User Con-
sultant. UC. they can always be
found next to the orange flag in
YMCA, Gchomp in ARI-l, or the
MathAN. UC's can also be found
by typing UCFINDER at the VAX
prompt.

Making Dreams easy begins when
you log into the VAX and see a new
mail message from a friend, call the
person Ian. All VAX Commands to
type into the computer will be in ital—
ic:..

Now to begin with the commands,
first type new to get a listing of your
e-mail. Then select the number of
the e-mail from Ian. After reading
Ian's message, you like what he has
said and want to be able to reply to
speciﬁc pans of his letter.

At the “Action <Keep>7" prompt
Iype reply/extract and hit <enter>,
this copies Ian‘s message into your
reply to him. A list ofthe commands
so far is as follows.

5 new
Initial Action <Read 1)? 1
Action <Keep>7 reply/extract

To edit specific parts of his letter,
you need to invoke the text editor
which allows you to move between
lines of the letter you write and
make corrections

On a Macintosh, hit the / key on
the numeric keypad on the far right
ofthe keyboard. On a PC, hit the *
key on the numeric keypad.

Now you can reply to and delete
any part ofIan’s message you want.
Generally speaking, chl with a
greater than sign (>) in front of it is
the other person’s message

Once you have written your reply
to Ian‘s message, hit the “control
key" and “e" at the same time. It‘
by accident you hit <Cirl»Z> likc
normal to send the message. don’t
worry, just type exit and then you
get a list ofcommands which allow
you to send the message.

Hit <enter> to send the message
and you’re done. Here’s What it
looks like.

Ctrl-E or Ctrl-Z
:exit
Edit option <send>: send
Next, suppose another friend

'Kathy sent an e»mail that you

thought was funny and you waiiled
to save it, and print it out, Type m
at your VAX prompt to get ti list of
emails.

This command also lets you scroll
through an e-mail page by page in-
stead of having the entire message
ﬂash by quickly. Once you have se»
lected and read Kathy's message. at
the “Action <chp>7" prompt type
output funnyixt. This outputs
Kathy’s message to a file in your
VAX account Funny.txt is the
ﬁlename you assign to Kathy's e—
mail message. like naming a file in
MS Word.

To print funnytxt, type prinl/
aniir:Cawlcs/ fininytrt, ask a UC
for help if you want to print some—
where clse. Funnytxt can also be
included in e»mails to otlicr people.
when you are sending an e»mail to
the person who would like Kathy's
message, on a blank line type
@fmmy.t.rl.

3% in
Action <Keep>? output funny.txt
$ print/queue:Cowlesl funnytxt

These ate Just a few of the com-
mantis available in Dreams, type help
mail sometime at the VAX prompt
to lctirii inorc. Ifyou have any ques»
tions or continents, or good topics for
this column, me at
ultdersa:@tlc.g7t'txrzltl.

There is also more infonnation on
the S&B web page, Please explore
this to make dreams easier for you.

Whimsies about a
crazy Iowa summer

By DUSTIN KEY
Staff Writer

Expectations are low when one
dwells ovel tlic‘ possibility ofspend-
ing summer in good old Grinnell.
How could aliyjoy be derived from
a town which barely pushes a popu»
lation of 9,000 and doesn’t even
have a MC Donaldsl However,
when one-tweltli of the student
body decides to live in Grinnell
over the summer, the 5&3 decides
to investigate.

Any student who spends their
summer in Grinncll will ineVitably
be ridiculed and asked the question:
‘Wliy‘l'. When they are asked their
cadence is to the effect of ‘Why
not.’ Yes, why not?

Most students report that the main
reason they decided to stay in
Grinnell is that they do not wish to
live with their parents and rent here
is cheap Chris deBeer ‘97 says “I
wanted to live in something I was
paying rent for. And since I_didn’l
want to pay a lot rent I decided to
stay in Grinnell.“

Students usually have no trouble
securing monthly rent around $100
to $140, often including ulililies
and various other |ife»fornis (Le.
bats, wasps. rats, mice) The cost
orliving here seems reasonable to
most and one would have to try re»

ally hard in order to find a place
within Grinncll to spend lots of
money.

In older to sustain income. the vast
majority of students have found
themselves working in either
Grinncll's food service industry,
Burling, or science research. This
summer, science research seemed to
have been reduced as a result ofthe
building construction.

But there is more to life here Iliaii
sheer economy. For those who do it.
living in Grinnell seems to provide a
better sense ofcommunily and intone
sifles the Grinnell experience. Jason
Nagcl ‘97 encapsulates much of the
summer when he says “It‘s a differ»
ent town when you're not trapped on
the campus. You feel like you're
more in touch with the community
And...there was a lot of drinking ”

[can only guess about the drinking,
but indeed while I was here for the
summer I personally met many Grin-
nell store owners and customers who
were anxious to have conversations
about the community. I can attest that
one’s feelings for Grinnell intensity
as one spends more time here, espe»
cially in the slow, care»free manner
that the summer provides.

Grinnnellians who spent the sum-
mer met students returning home for
the summer from other institutions
across the nation, and even the world, .

Town and gown relations seemed to
do prctty well this summer. There
was a lot of bonding between
Grinnelllltns of the college and
Gl’lnnelltansoi the town. MLE Davis
‘98 who states "this has been a sum-
mcrofhcatltil'ul stagnation”, says also
that she bontled well with the town
folk as she worked at the Back Alley
Deli mid Pizza Hut. This is not to
say that Grinncll college students
didn't broaden relationships amongst
themselves and other faculty and
staff.

Eondingtook various creative forms
during the summer. After working
most of the day many students would
find themselves at Jitnbo’s watching
the Simpdrms, as they probably did
during the school»yelir, anyway.

On Tuesday alid Thursday evenings
as many as ﬁfty students would con-
gl'egute iii ordcr to play volleyball.
Alirens park (located on the east pe-
rimeter of Grinnell) would often at-
tract n dozen or so to play basketball.
Various houses would take turns
throwingtlinncr parties, or sometimes
otliei less stable fot'ms‘of partying.

apparcnii y made it home movie about
LilliOMILIIx

Aflct mo summers of Grinnell, I
still claim that there is nothing better
than‘ oing into Cunningham’s on a
hot tidy and having it nice ﬂoat. Oth~
en eiaim thin taking an illicit dip in
the Country Club’s pool is what they
would want. I advise against this; I
have heard too many stories of folks
being chased out of there by the po-
lice, sometimes ileclng through the
dark completely naked. Many would
go to Rock Creek, which does have a
well-hidden bench.

[must report thlit the mythical High
street block»paity didn‘thnppen. Al-
though, squirredancing bccame a fe-
tish and tilt: Powesiiiek Pluckers
would happily pltiy tunes for the rest
oi ns. Their: was sortie dancing done
oli High SllCCI, And. of course,
people would have long conversa—
tions on pinches tintl phones, watch
videos, and visit drinking establish»
merits,

For sonic. the summer at Grinnell
was too much; they hint to get out of
here. such an csctipc would involve
a our, six to ten c ‘r faces, and in»
sane quantities of h being spent in
order to put-chasc objects which didn’t
exist in Grinnell,

 

» You too can drink martinis.

Add Imported TanquerayTM gin to
ice, plus a splash of Martini &
RossiTM vermouth. Stir. Add
01ive(s). Drink slowly.
You can find everything you need
for a super martini at the Wine

Cellar.
