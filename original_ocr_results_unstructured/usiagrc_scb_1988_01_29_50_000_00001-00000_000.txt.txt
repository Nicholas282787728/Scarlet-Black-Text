ran from December 27 to January

these cities, students visited the his

part or the Soviets to understand
the us. They spent time at the
Union of Writers as well, where
they heard two major Soviet
novelists speak. They were also
taken to the private studios or tour
artists in Ustonia, and visited the
small town where Lenin was born.

Drake Named Head
of Sports’Association

by Bruce Emond

Atter serving iour years as a
member of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association lNCAA)
President's Commission, Grinnell
president George Drake was
elected to chair the Division~3 sub-
committee. Drake accepted the
position at the close of the NCAA
Convention last month.

Drake said the Commission was
created in 1984 to give college
presidents input into athletics at
their schools. “There were a lot of
problems because college athletics
were dominated by coaches and
athletic directors and presidents
were not involved,” said Drake.
Although Drake believes the Com-
mission was instrumental in ellec-
ting some reiorms, he conceded
these were “slowegoing.”

Drake’s new duties include
preparing the agenda tor thecom-
mission's three annual meetings
and acting as spokesperson for the
organization He Cited the length of
athletic seasons, the varying level
of competition within the divisions,
and the debate over athletic
scholarships as problems the come
mission will address at its next
meeting,

Recently returned from teaching
with [he Grinnell'in'London pro-
gram, Drake stated that he feels
retreshed. “I really do enjoy
teaching, and it was a great .

Ru'ssla, aii tne people come with
little or no preparation," said
Kaiser. ”They bring cultural bags
gage that doesn't permit them to
understand Russia. it only permits
them to argue. By being well
prepared. our group was able to
understand the land much better."

Actually visiting Russia provid-
ed another dimension ol
understanding tor all that the
students had studied in the
classroom. "The course taught me
enough so that nothing really fazed
me while i was there." said Rus»
sian major Melissa Cross, '89.
”But nothing prepared me [or

ingrad and seeing where Russian
and German soldiers had been."

The program grew out oi an inn
terdisciplinary iocus on Soviet
Studies that began in the 15705.
Students sponsored by the pro
gram have been traveling to
Russia since lots. "The purpose oi
the program is to better undersr
tand the society with which we
have been at odds," Prolessor
Mohan said,

“In Volgagrad we touched the
bullet holes on the low buildings
leit standing alter World War II,"
said Scott England, '90. “It was
like touching a piece oi history."

“The course gave us a realistic
view oi the Soviets." said history
major Chris Victor, '89. “But I
wasn't prepared tor how open peo-

perience, The group ol students
was very good and there was a lot
of togetherness, It was nice to step
aside from presidential duties and
teach again,” he said.

Drake said he was aware oi the
events. such as the controversy
over acting President Waldo
Walker's comments about a core
curriculum and the black students'
Speakeasy. which dominated cams
pus news last semester. “I had
quite a lot oi my mail sent on to me

Walker about every two weeks by
phone. But oi course I missed the

ple were or how ready they were to
criticize Soviet institutions."

The program also dispelled
several misconceptions that
Americans seem to have about the
Eastern nation. “Americans
perceive Russians as cold and
cruel." Cross said. “They do seem
grim on the street. but it's
iascinating how warm and lriendly
they are once you talk to them."

Studene also commented that
contrary to American popular
belieis, Russians are not all
patriotic and enthusiastic towards
their country. Many are cynical
about Corbachov's success and
some told Grinnell students what
was wrong with the Soviet system
and what must be fixed.

Returning from the program,
students realized the iaultiness of
many American attitudes. “Now

studying it. changes the way we
see them,” said political science
