Spread of Flu
Fills Infirmary;
Many Confined

Grinnell's flu epidemic is spread-

ing this week, Miss Florence N.
Swan, college nurse reports, with
a total of twenty-eight patients
in the hospital yesterday, and
with the infirmary full at all
times.

In addition to these totals, six
or eight students, on the average,
have beenconﬁncd to their rooms
throughout the week because of
lack of space in the infii-mary,
and the empty guest rooms in
the quad have been converted into
sick-rooms for other flu victims

Miss Swan emphasized the turn-
over amoiig the flu patients. “No
infirmary bed is empty more than
an hour after a patient is diSV
charged before another one
arrives.” she said. “The same
is true at the hospital."

Nuos Dciitsehcs theatre in Prague
and appeared in recitals in many
European cities. Her best know
ioles abroad included Carmen and
Delilah, and Octavian in “Pto-
senkavalier."

Since her arrival in the United
States in 1938, Miss Sten has
been acclaimed for her roles in
“Alda,” the “Masked Ball," “11
Trovatore," "Hansel and Gretel,"
and Martha."

Dance Training

Spanish dancing, ballet dancing,
and extensive training in plaistl
qiie are part of her artistic equip-
ment, making her "Carmen” vivid
and authentic. Miss Sten is of
medium height, with slanting
green eyes and black hair that
suggest Scarlet O'Hara to some
observers.

That opera should be sung in
English for an English-speaking
audience is a firm belief of Miss
Sten. “I have had the pleasure
of singing “Hansel and Gretel”
and “Martha” in English But I
think that most Anglicized

operas, could be greatly improved
