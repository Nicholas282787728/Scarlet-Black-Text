Injured Recover As
Squad Aims For
Coe Dual

By Clark Smith

The Pioneer track Squad has
resumed its daily workouts and
at present, is engaged in a res
conditioning process after a
week’s layoff. The cold weather
is slowing up their progress on
the resurfaced straightaway on
Ward field.

Providing the squad has round-
ed into favorable condition by the
end of the week, Coach G. Lester
Duke plans to hold an intra-
squad meet Saturday. Co-captains
Lynn Schlotterbeck and John
Hayward will choose up sides
that are as well balanced as pos-
sible, and conduct a regular meet.

The thin clads are pointing to-
wards their first outdoor meet
of the year with Coe on April
16. General squad strength is be
ing stressed because of the na-
ture of the events that are
planned to be run on that date.
Once again, baton passing is be-
ing emphasized because of the
numerous relay events that are
in store for the future.

Ted Applcquist is still handle
capped from the leg injury he
suffered several weeks ago, but
he is expected to be in shape
to run in top condition in an—
other week. Ray Crossman has
recovered from his injury and is
able to run at full speed without
experiencing any pain in his feet,
With the improvement of these
men, and others, in their plly~
sical condition, the squad should
soon be in excellent shape for
the balance of their schedule:

April 16: Coe here

April 23: Iowa state Teachers
college Relays, Cedar Falls.

April 29730: Drake Relays, Des
Moines.

May 5: Beloit Relays, Beloit,
Wis.

May 14: Drake and Iowa State

May 20721: Missouri Valley con-
ference meet, St. Louis. Mo,
