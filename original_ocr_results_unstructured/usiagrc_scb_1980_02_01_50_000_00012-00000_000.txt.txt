Change lifestyle, avoid war

To the editor:l have just left the Town
Meeting held Monday night concern-
~ing president's Carter's proposed
reinstitution oi (drait) registration A
lot was said. I wonder what will be
done? I Wonder it the people in South
Lounge Monday night are aware or
how much influence they can have in
determining the actions of their nation
and world events. And I wonder if we
realize that we are the ones responsir
ble tor our nation’s dependence on
such massive quantities or loreign oil,
and thus our nation's “Vital interests”
in the PerSlan Gull. We are the ones

know, but instead of being told about
yourseli, maybe you’ll be able to tell
somebody else about youiMike

Just a couple of closing notes. A late
addition to the weekends’ lilm
schedule is “The Olympics and
Politics 19367Jesse Owens vs. Adoll
Hitler ” I‘m told it is only about an
hour long, and it should be interesting
in view of the possible mixture of
politics and the Olympics in the up-

who blatantly abuse energy resources,
are unwilling to iorcelully explore solt
energy paths, and in general, refuse to
curb our energy consuming lilestyles,
Yep, we are responsible [or our nation
having to assume a position in which
drait registration, activation of the
drait, and engaging in combat have to
be considered.

For me, there is no question that
what is happening in Ai'ganistan is
brutal and abominable. But are the
Soviets the only threat to the United
States. Who was it that predicted

Gregg Edwards clarifies Anderson campaign

After reading last week's SStB ac-
count ot the First Ward Republican
Caucus, one might get the wrong im-
pression regarding the motives of Cone
gressman John Anderson‘s campaign.
I would like to clear up any such
misunderstandings,

The emphasis of Anderson‘s Grin-
nell campaign and his statewide came
paign was to make a better than one
percent showing in the straw poll.
Due to severely limited resources, the
Anderson campaign was lorced to
bypass the Iowa caucuses. it had vir-
tually nu statewide organization and
no paid staff workers in Iowa. The
Iowa Poll two weeks before the
caucuses showed Anderson with a one
percent standing, and those of us

around the state working for Anderson
believed that we Could do better than
one percent, Considering all the lac-
tors weighing against us, a greater
than one percent showing would be a
Victory tor the Anderson campaign.
(In fact, Anderson received over four
percent or the poll.)

The selection of delegates was not a
primary consideration of the cam~
paign. The same applied to the eiiort
in Grinnell. In other words, the
“‘power ploy' attempted by the Ander~
son organizers” with regard to
delegate selection failed, in part,
because it never existed.

The many Anderson supporters

after the straw poll was not a result of

As we consider how our situation
can be assuaged. l believe that our
first priority should not be in mobiliz»
ing our armed iorces but rather to
reassess our lifestyles, explore alter-
native energy resources, and to com-
mit ourselves to adjusting our living
standards to the energy resources
available.

I have to ask mysell, am 1 willing to
allow those people oi drait age to risk
their lives so Exxon can show a yearly

our poor organization, as much as the
article implied. I told many Anderson
supporters to leave the caucus alter
the poll it they wanted to do so. They
had served their purpose. I did not
believe it was lair for college students,
no matter who they supported, to take
over the caucus. College students are
transient participants in Grinnell
politics. The yeardong residents of
the First Ward are the ones who do
the bulk or the Republican Party’s
work. College students should certainr
ly participate in the County Convene
tion (as live students will do), but they
should not dominate the First Ward
delegation to the County Convention.
Such a delegation would not be
representative ot the First Ward, just
as a delegation dominated by Anders
son supporters would not have been
truly representative oi First Ward
Republicans.

In addition, there were good prace
tical reasons for the Anderson sup»
porters not to wage battle for the
delegate positions, The caucus was
step one in a tour step process Even
ii the caucus had elected a majority of
Anderson delegates, it is highly unlike-
ly that more than one person would be
selected by the County Convention to
go to the (Congressional) District Cone
vention.
