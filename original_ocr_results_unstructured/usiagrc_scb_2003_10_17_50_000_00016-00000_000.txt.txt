After posring d-l vierories againsr conference opponents Knox
and Monmouth on Oct. 4, the women's tennis team claimed ﬁist

Conference Championships, which will be held roday ar Boylan High
School in Rockford, Ill. Grinnell will take on the No. 2 North Divle
sion seed, Carroll. The north division No, 1 seed Ripon will face
