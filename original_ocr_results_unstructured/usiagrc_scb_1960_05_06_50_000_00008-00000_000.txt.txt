Demonstrators Arouse Prof-Student Interest

To the Editor:

From such things as the dome

gym during the Military Balk,

one can draw a comparison ber
tween the plea tor unilateral

words of leaflets issued by tho
Communists during the Korean
war:

To the Editor:

Another group has been heard
irom The display of opinion in
tront oi Darby last Saturday was

rery cttcctlve 7 in displaying

opinion.

The important question now
remains: what action, what
concrete steps. will these people
take to alleviate the conditions
which they protested? t

I do not ask the impossible —
that they themselves effect the
stupendous task of negotiating
and carrying out a disramamcnt.
l do ask that they do something
beyond telling'us ,what they bc~
lieve.

Granted that their deumnstraa
tion mav sway the opinions oi
others. But even this‘ is in itseii
tutile. Unless opinion has some
resolution inaction. it is use.
lessly (and often, harmfully) ex-
pressed, ,

Let the demonstrators, there.
fore, come iorth with some spa»
ciii proposals ior action by the
individual student, and let
them take part in this action
themselves.

If the demonstrators cannot im—
plement their opinions, their di.
play of' Saturday night stands
open to condemnation as at best
useless and at worst childish.

To the Editor:

in view of some of the more

Firstly, the raison d' etre or

has been .oiig since super-ceded.

originally it was thought that
once the Emma states rcachcd

a stage at whit-ll it would he
ioolliardy tor‘ the Russians to
try a surprise attack on this
country, there would be no
need to continue amassing wea-
nous. '

To the Editor:

The past few weeks have seen
a tremendous birth of social in-
terest and action on the Grln~
nell campus. Concerning this, i
would like to say a few words
about the demonstration in iro'ntl

of' the AFROTU oancc last Sat-l
urday night, .

All of those who participated.
in the marching and singing arc
in agreement on two things: (1),
the dangers or nuclear war are'
too great to risk any cliancc_ of
its occurring, and t2) the crust-
once of any military establish»
mcnts on campuses is not in
keeping with the goals ot edu-
cation. (In the case of.crinncll,
see the trustees’ statement in
the April 29 issue of the scar—
lct and Blackl.

Representatives from the group
that picketed the dance have
spoken with members of the
ROTC statf and with a repre—
sentative of the college admin.
istratlon: 0f most interest is the
position presented by the ROTC
otticials. -

They, as Air Force otiicers,
are “in full accord with the
first protest at the group. They
too would like to see the
chance for the use oi thermo-
nuclear arms reduced. now-
cvcr, they were not able to
present any attempts beyond
proposals tor the accomplish-
iiicnt at this goal.

As can well he expected, they
:ldld nct View wrth sympathy the
'sccolid protest_oi the demonstra.
tors They argued that ii thc
armed torces are to exist on a
national level, they must be
supplied with officers who are
trained not only in the military
methods oi the age,‘ but in the
methods of administration and
management, and who can, in
addition, think clearly and are»
ativcly about problems arising
in their work.

in reply to the position ol the
AFROTC, the group would like
to say that specillc action’ must
be taken, starting now, to end
the testing of nuclear arms and,
cricctively to prevent the use
of these weapons, as well as
chemical and bacteriological wear
pops in any future conflicts.

Boiorc such -tion can begin
(the attempts in the past have
been so pitilul that I am in~
clincd not to count theiiil.
there must be a national
awareness at the horrible de-
structive power oi thcsc wens I
pon coupled with a desire to
eliminate the chance that hir-
inan life will end in a thermo-
liuclc' r trophc.

lt is the desire at ths group
to assist in creating this aware
ness, and it seems that/the pick—
icting went a long way toward

 

 

 

that goal at Grinncll.

As regards the emstcncc oi
military establishments on col»
lege campuses, we argue that,
while it is true that thc exist
his military nccds educated ole
iicers, the training oi these on
campuses trcatcs atti-
tudcs of approval and accept.
ance of the military in the minds
or the students.

That this is true is indicated
by the reaction oi many stu»
dents to the Saturday night acA

ltion. it did not cuter their minds
.that such a protest could be in

earnest.

it is prcciscly the approba-
tioir oi military activities that
hinders elfectltt: peace talkR

ll. is exactly (he presence of ’

unii'orms that creates chiruv-
inistic thought.

Nearly all students entering
college have impressionable, l‘es
ccptivc minds tit they did not,
they would be wasting time
and money for tour years oi
frustration), and to condition
these minds by subtle forces at
an uiiiiitciidcil psychological nae
turc appears to he at variance
with the ti’ustccs' slalement that
Grinnell college trics to “awaken
or strengthen the moral values
and spiritual concerns (in the
student ,) and to motivate
him toward concern for his
neighbors, democratic ideals,
consciousness ot social responsi—
bilities and a lilc of service to
mankind.” ,

it is very important to un-

derstand that we do not rev
gard the R010 program as
“warmongering.” Both the ol-
iiccrs hero and the group are
more reasonable than to adopt
such an attitude. ,

VVhlle.I pel‘sul‘lzllly, and SCVA

~ci-al other members otthe group,

would like to see the immediate
end of the entire military scr-

lvice, this is not the group’s
lvicw; nor is it a practical guidc
‘for action‘ considering the pres
Icnt attitudes of the population
or tbc United States. if it is
lthen accepted that ROTC is nec-
‘cssary, the question arises, is
ltllcre a more clicctive and des
_ ~ablc program?
l The answcr is, l think,
The oblections raised in th

dertake to have
ial of an intcllectual nature
,handlcd by nonrnll‘rltary college
:statl, and if students would at
tend summer camps for their
military indoctrination. This
would solve a good part of tlic
,prohlehi as the group sees it.
it should be notcd that tho
iii-st portion or this proposal
is nearly identical to thc rc-
vised'ROTC program ior next
year, and that a chance oi,
the sort proposed'in the sec-
ond part would rcquirc a re-
. vision or icdcral law. But if
an idea is wise, then the law
will be changed to agree with
it

Thi

'3 not the place, nor is
exact merits of this compromise

obvious.

As was expected when the
picketing was planned, there has
been considerable opposition to
the technique used. it is said
that other methods oi protest
are

cofice hours—and that these
should have been used tir . But
these take time to prepare, and
