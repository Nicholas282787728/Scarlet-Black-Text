Professor’s love of Stone tools leads to first book

By JULIE MICKENS

G professorandarchaeologist

John Whittaker published
his first book, Flint/mapping: Makv
ing and Understanding Starla Tool:v
only recently, but his interest in the
prehistoriccmftbeganinaCalifomia
gas Station and has now led him to a
new anthropologic study of an an-
nual Missouri "knappcr's conven»
tion."

When Whittaker was a boy. his
family stopped atthe station on their
way through the state. There, the
young Whittaker was intrigued by a
box of arrowheads he found on the
counter.

“You were supposed to guess
which ones this guy had made and
which ones were fake," he said.

Later, when pursing graduate
studies in France, Whittaker found
another future flintknapper and the
two taught themselves the craft.

F lint/mapping. Whittaker says,
is partially intended for the up-and-
coming stone tool~maker.

“My ambition was to write the
book I wish I'd had," he said.

Since its publication in April by
the University of Texas Press.
Flint/mapping has sold over 1500
copies. which Whittaker says is good
for an academic book. The book’s
success suggests that it has reached a
relatively large hobby audience.

Part of the book‘s function is a
hode manual for knappers, com-

“There is a surprising numberol
people interested in making arrowr
headsjust for fun," Whittaker said.

About 100 of those people gather
in Fort Osage, Missouri, each year
for a “knapsinf‘ as Whittaker de-
scribed it.

The hobbyists exchange infors
mation. show offtheir work. and talk
about some of the ethical issues in-
volved with knapping. For example.
the artifact market is large. and a
good crafsperson could makealotof
money passing aft” a modem spear-
head for the actually prehistoric.
Whittakerfindsthesepeoptesointer-
esting that he is beginning an anthro-
pological survey of the group.

In addition to basic instructions
for knappers, Whittaker intended to
reach a more general audience with
his book by presenting“a perspective
on how archaeologists look at stone
tools."

Concerned that many historical
archaeological sites are being de-
strayedbyaru'fact-seekeis,Whittaker
alsocommunicates his beliefthatdigs
ging should be for scholarly purposes.

“If you like nice artifacts. you
oughttolcam to make them," hesaid.

Whittaker uses his stone tools to
experiment and gain an understand»
ing of how they worked for prehis-
toric humans. "I’ve used them to
butcher animals, cut hides."

He explained his fondness for
the craft: "Each flake that you re-
move either prepares the way for the
next ﬂake or makes a mistake you
have to deal with, [A tool] is a little
slice of prehistoric life. What] see in
a stone tool is the person behind it-
that‘s what's really interesting."

Whittaker says his book took
several years to write, on and off.
“Oh yeah, I still stroke it now and
then. It’sabig piece ofwork andl’m
glad it's out."

crack down on that."
