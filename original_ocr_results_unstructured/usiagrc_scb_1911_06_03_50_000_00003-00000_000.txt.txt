The Friday chapel exercises this
wccli were led by Professor Charles
)3. Austin. inasmuch as Mr Austin
does not eipect to he in tiriunell the
coming year, ire took this occasion to
make remarks concerning some of
' 'rrrell's ideals and what they have
meant to him.

lie introduced his subiect by illus-
trating the typical condr ion oi man-
kind b. the sw-a ng trees in a forest.
which are inverted pcndulurns 01 mi-
equal length. Tlrelr- lat‘li oi harmony
and equality the speaker believed to
be characteristic, ot' lirrrnari lite. Then
he tontrasted the swaying trees with
the gentle undulations ot a ﬁeld or rip~
cned grain. which move in regular
wavrs, all the saute length and time.
And this mi and cooperation Mr.
Austin compared to society in its ideal
state— the state which s encouraged
by ttic atmosphere and tendencies of
this College. The change has been
wrought by the introduction of the
spirit oi love into life, Tire speaker
closed h_ reading the tlr ‘teentll chap-
ter or ﬁrst Corinthians. which alalyzes
and pay tribute to this element of
love, which was the theme he desired
to emphasize.

The pupils at Fraulein Konopasek.
teacher ot vocal music in tire Grinnell
School at Music. will give a recital in
Herrick Chapel this evening at 7:30
o'clock. All are cordially invited to
attend.

A movement is on loot among the
business men to have Henry Cooper
remain in Grinnell for the summer and
organize a town band, and give us some

 

evening music in the park. Mr. Cooper
is a thorough musician and a good
leader. ﬁnd all will hope the movement
