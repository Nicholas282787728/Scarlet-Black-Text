I decided to come to Grinnell because when my
tour guide threw his body into the squishy abyss of the
former bean bag room and scraped his hip so badly
upon landing that he had to momentarily stop the tour,
I got the impression that Grinnellians were pretty kick-
ass individualist When I arrived on campus Inst fall, this
impression was confirmed (albeit no more beanbags.
Sigh”) However, last weeks Student Initiative voting
reminded me that there are still many ways to improve
our generally kick-ass sclves. T,hus I propose a few ini-
tiatives that were left offthe ballot

Initiariae a One: Beyrczi Hig/r-rreeeI-ertyie Dining
Hall Sea/ingAnmgmimizr.

It's lunch time. You
enter your lessrfrcquented
dining hall, pile some Jojo
wedges onto your plate, but
as you go to sit down, your
stomach drops asyou realize
the only person you meg,
nize is that girl who might sit behind you in Pliilosos
phy. Rather than subject yourself to the uncomfortable
act of plopping your tray down next to strangers, you
retreat back to the salad bar and take an exceptionally
long time redressing your salad until a recognizable face
appears. Ah, relief! No more spending another lunch
period pretending to read a book.

While it’s natural to want to eat with the same peo-
ple all the time,I believe we’re all a bit old for the clique
ish abomination that is high school and that much can
be gained from branching out into unfirniliar territory.

So the next time you find yourselffriendless, instead
of adding a few more carrots to your spinach leaves,

When you're constantly surrounded by people who
ate fluent in four languages and who spent last summer
teaching blind children to read, it's easy to fall into the
trap of thinking you suck when, in fact, you don’t,

The next time your self-esteem takes a particu-
larly stccp dive, remove all your clothing, stand naked

in front of your mirror rind
remind yourself that you're
good enough. That you’re
intelligent, That you're
quite attractivc, And that
at times, you even emit a
pleasant musk. Kind of like
a thousand spring mornings
coupled with cookies and fabric softener. (Note: Naked
Affirmation works best when you lock your door. Also,
waiting until your roommate leaves for class before you
begin may prevent undue awkwardness.)

While I do love my fellow students,I fear that the
negative behaviors ofa few damage the Grinnellian im~

spirit recedes into the gaping hole that once housed part

These acts of destruction may seem like inconsee
oucntial or even unavoidable aspects of college life. But
ldisagiee.

I think we can do better.

When we vomit and run, SAs and FM are forced
to mop (or vacuum) up our stomach stew. When we
damage and steal campus property, innocent people get
fined, and a resource or service we previously enjoyed
disappears. Not to mention the immense annoyance
that results from your having only 3 minutes to get
from Colvles to Mears Cottage, and knowing that the
irresponsible behavior ofa fellow student tookone more
campus bike out ofioratron. Why should we settle for
thc troubling status quo? We are Grinnellians, after all.

And we're also big girls and boys. so it's time to
grow up, We cannot go on acnng as though the campus
is a L121]! Mermaid coloring book, and we the permnr
nent markets that my brother once used to black out
Ariel's eyes on every page.

If the desire to be immature so strikes you, you can
giggle with friends about crotch bulges, or shave subs
liminal messages into your facial hair. But it is certainly
possible to have a fantastic time without throwing bikes
from loggias and damaging our home.

By enacting Initiative #3, I’ll be proud to know that
when prospies are lured to Grrnnell by the eccentric
personality of a tour guide, they‘ll become part of a
community that not only exudes kick-ass-ncss, but one
that radiates respect and responsibility, as well. And that
would kick a whole lotta ass.

No one to blame but yourself, chubbsie

Blaming particular companies and
countries for poor economic conditions
has become an American pastime. In the
past we‘ve been told that American steel,
textile and car manufacturers can attri-
bute their weak performances to unfair
competition from cheap importers who
are somehow cheating by paying lower
wages to their workers. Now it seems the
populist “blame evcryonc but ourselves”
groups on both the right and the left
have identified their economic boogeyr
men for the twenty-first century.

For the right and left, China has
become a whipping boy for legislators,
unions and manufacturers frustrated by
perpetually rising trade deficits and out-
sourcing Many have argaied that Chi-
na's policy of maintaining an artiﬁcially
low value in its currency and low wages
have lowered prices for Chinese goods
in the international market, giving them
a trade advantageIn response, the Bush
Administration recently negotiated vol-
untary export quotas for Chinese tex-
tiles, afrirming the trade hypocrisy otthe
U.S. in the minds of some. WaleMart
has become public enemy number one
for the political left for forcing suppliers
to outsource their manufacturing out»
ofrcountry and keeping unions out of
its stores. The discomfort with the new

Super Wal Matt in town among many
students here is one manifestation of the
anti-Wal»Mart sentiment.

But the interrelated problems of a
soft job market and burgeoning trade
deficits aren’t really WaltMtIrt's, or even
China‘s fault. Yes, Wal-Mart pushes
suppliers and blue—collar manufacturing
jobs overseas and Outtcompcte smaller
local stores, and China’s government
manipulates exchange markets to main—
tain a favorable trade balance. But ulti-
mately they act in response to a partiCUt
lar economic context that is determined
by the consumption behavior of every
American: unfortunately, Americans
like to buy a lot of crap.

We buy so much crap in fact, that

ing federal spending and budget deficits
that have reached about 4 percent of

blame lies—with individual Americans.
We have failed in both our personal eco-
nomic as well as our civic responsibilities
to control our own spending and to ten
quire our elected officials to control their
fiscal spending.

one can come up with Complex eco-

nomic models to show how a reduction
in consumption rates in the US. would
affect the trade balance but, undoubt—
edly, we would be buying fewer foreign
goods. It is safe to assume that if lower
to middle— income families (WaleMart’s
consumer base) spend less of theu dis»
posable income, they would continue to
spend the same amount on necessary
items like food grown and processed in
the US and less on the cheap foreign
luxury merchandise (TVs, DVDs, rip-

This would

be true of

tion patterns

Our trade deﬁcit is determined by
our savings and investment rates. As

because we need less foreign invest
ment, lowering our exchange rate and
ultimately causing us to buy fewer for—
eign goods and export more us. made
goods, It seems that the fact that our
trade deficit will be pushing $700 billion
in 2005 would spur immediate substan»

tive action from citizens and govern-
ment to encourage greater austerity
among Americans. We could at least
make it a primary intellectual concern
on campuses

Unfortuuately, we talk more about
WalrMart and CocaeCola's behavior
than our own. Boycotting WaltMart
or setting limits on imports of China—
made goods in particular will not change
our trade position or create new Ameri-
can jobs. Retailers will switch to foreign
suppliers if they can make goods for
less, and this
general trend

set limits on
imports from
China, other low-wage countries such
as India and Indonesia will pick up the
slack and we’ll end up with nearly the
same trade balance as before.

What we can do to have a substanr
tive effect on the trade balance is reduce
our overall consumption rates. But that

Tlme for active partlctpatlon

Congratulations, to everyone that has gotten their
initiatives passed. However, getting the administm-
tion to view your proposal is not the ﬁnal step to
invoke change on campus. It's mid—way!!! What’s
needed is “active participation" that supports your
proposal. Iwould look at past “active participation”
at Grinnell, Due to limited space those mating to
“actively participate" should look into the events that
have changed Grinnell into what it is today. The ex—
amples that] raised at the open forum are a few ways
to get students to “actively respond so that other (the
students and the adminisn’adon) notice the sodery
(regionally and globally) around us

Opposition will exist because every man'is enti- ‘

tied to his opinion. However, the struggle for power
will go to those most inﬂuential. With that being
said, get yourself together and go get it.
