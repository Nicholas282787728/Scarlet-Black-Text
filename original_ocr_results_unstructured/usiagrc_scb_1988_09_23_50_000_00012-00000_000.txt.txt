Men sweep two,

break into rankings
"Tuna" strikes again

11y Bob Lifton

What’da 'ya say, Cornell? No
m’am, that's Grrnnellr Haaah? Gr
R-IvN-N-E-L—L. Grinnell, never
heard of it. Don't you just hate
that. No recognition. Well,that
should soon change. The men’s
soccer team (yeah, ours) has time
ken into the national rankings,
named number eight in the West
last week. And after their two 1-
nil shutouts in Minnesota against
both Carleton and Augsburg
which upped their record to 470.
they should move up at least an-
other notch. Maybe this will put
a welcomed end to the ridiculuous
notion that academics and sports
don't -- or aren't supposed to ,_
mix.

So, how did they win two up
there in soccer country? Don‘t
ask coach Piitseh "I just Can‘t
put my ﬁnger on it.... It's hard
to win without a whole lot of
offense (in their first four games,
the Pioneers have managed a total
of six goals, while limiting their
oppostion to only one -- that
coming on a freebee penalty
shot), but somehow we're
managing it. I‘m glad our
defense is playing so wellr"

It‘s safe to say that the
defense played the vital role in
the games this past weekend.
The only goal in the Carleton
game came from... you guessed
it, goalie David "Tuna" Shane.
The "Tuna" Watch continues in a
big way,

Having the day off from his
regular duties in front the net,

Shane was insenml at foward for a
brief stint in the first half.
"Tuna" wasted no time putting
his latent offensive skills to
work. hcttding Andy Laing‘s
Corner kick into the far corner.
And that was all she wrote. The
Fish 1, the Carls nada. Sorry
Charlie

Ten minutes into the
Augsburg game Austin Simmons
smacked in KJ, Noll‘s rebound
for the only goal all afternoon.
In the two games. the Pioneers

outshot their opponents 32-16.
Nevertheless, the defense deserves
the bulk of the credit ,

More important than their
temporary (a little optimism
here) low goal output, however,
is the illustrious fact that the
Pioneers are nationally ranked.
This recognition is essential if
Grinnell has any shot at making
nationals, According to Pf‘rtsch,
"It (the ranking) gives us the
chance to be recognized as a good
team by the coaches who select
the national team.... I just hope
we can stay there"

Getting the weekend off, the
Pioneers will defend their reputa-
tion against Monmouth at home
on Wednesday in their first
conference game of the season.
While post-season play remains
only speculation at this early
point in the season, it's nice to
know that we're actually in
contention

Can you say, nationals? I
knew you could.“ Whisper itr

Tennis team cruises to 3-1
Ends week sweeping Coe 9-0

by Iattra Whitmorc

Grinnell's women's tennis
team is off to a solid start, with a
record of271 in conference and 3-
1 overall. The Pioneers kept
busy this past week with 4
matches in 7 days. l‘m tirod just
thinking about it.

Starting on Wednesday the
14Lh, the team took on William
Penn in non-conference play.
The Pioneers easily dispensed
with the inexperienced Penn
squad (composed mainly of
women's basketball players who
were encouraged to take up a new
sport) barely breaking a sweat.

Next the Pioneers travelled to
Wisconsin to take on St.
Norbert and Lawrence At St.
Norbert, Grinnell prevailed 5-4
when the number one doubles
learn of Erika Smith and Heather
Radach won the ﬁnal match. The
Pioneers did not fare as well
against Lawrence. Down 4»2
after the singles matches. with
Apryl Henry and Heather Radach
winning, the Pioneers had to win
all three doubles matches to win
the meet Unfortunately only the
doubles' team of Elizabeth
Banfteld and Jenny Wang could
overcome their strong opponents
and Lawrence won 6-3.

The ﬁnal meet was at home
against Coe on Tuesday
Grinnell was just plain superior
to the weaker Kohawks. No one
lost more than two games a set
in singles, and all the doubles
teams easily handled their
opponents, with Grinnell
emerging as a 9-0 victor.
Elizabeth Werner deserves special
recognition for winning her
match 6-1, 6-0. despite a swollen
eye from a vicious bee sting (the
perils of offvcampus livingi).

Coach Fairchild is pleased
with the way her team is playing,
"What can you say when we're
beating everyone so, 6-] -- we're
a very strong team, Senior Lisa
Jepsen agrees with this saying,
"Last year we were humliated at
cdnfcrence because we came in

Despite playing four matches in seven days, women still
manage to serve up a perfect victory over rival Kohawks.

behind C00 and they didn‘t win a
match (Grinnell did win matches,
but because of an idiotic scoring
procedure, which we will not go
into, Coe had more points), but
this year we can compete against
anyone in conference"
