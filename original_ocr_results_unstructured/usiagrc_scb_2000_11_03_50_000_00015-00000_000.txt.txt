Ultimate takes top
spots at tournaments

Coed team wins division in Chicago; women take home
third from Hallowinona tournament in Minnesota

by B.Ji Bloom
Staff Writer

Both Ultlmtttc Frisbee teams traveled to
Winona. Minn , last weekend to play in the
Hullowmona tournament 0(32 men’s teams
and 10 women’s teams. The men’s team, [hC
Grinnellephants, Carried the second seed in
their dlvlslon after the ﬁrst day but lost both
of their games on the second day and did
not place. The women’s team, the Sticky
Tongues, went 4-3 and placed third overall
in the tournament.

The Grinnellephants started the tourna-
l-ncnt offwell, coming back from 6-2 to beat
Macalasrcr in the first game orthc day on
Saturday. They played a tough game against
University ofMinnesota, losingby one point,
and then lost to ﬁrstrranked Iowa Hawkeyes
Ultimate Club (Il-lUC). However, by wmr
mngtheir final game againerhitewater and
having scored the most points against IHUC,
the Grinnellephanis were able to place sore
ond in their division after {he first day of
play.

Dcspltc the good start on Saturday,
Grinnell did not play very well on Sunday.
They lost a close match to university or
MinnesotarDuluth and then suffered a dis»
appointing loss to University of Northern
Iowa, who were playing without any substi.
tunons.

Garrett Hansen ‘02, co»captain of the
team, said he felt that the team played well
considering how young the team is.

“Most people played pretty well the first
day. butwt just lost our intensity on the secs
ond day," said Hansen. “We're obviously still
working things out. trying to gain some ex
perience for the new players. its all part of
the process oflearning to play as a team."

Though individual statistics were not
kept, Hansen pointed out that Karl
Steenheek ’04, and Nathan Corvino ’01,
each played very well, particularly on the
hist day

The stickyTongucs. playing in their first
tournament this yearns awomcn’s team, did
exceptionally well. After two early disap.

pointing losses to Winona and Gustavus
Adolphus on Saturday, the women ioared
back and took the final two games or the
day from Macalastcr and st. John's. Then on
Sunday the StickyTongucs won two and lost
one to take third place,

Team concaptsin Meg Glausscr ‘02,
said site was very proud of the way the
team played. “1 think we played really
well," she said. “The stickies have never
won a game in a tournament before. This
is the ﬁrst year we had a good turnout and
really came together as a team."

This was the second major tournament
ofthe season for the Ultlmate team. At
the Windy city tournament, a co-ed (cure
namenr during the ﬁrst weekend of Fall
Break in Chicago. the crinnellephants
won their division and took home the
third place trophy overall (out of 16
teams).

At that tournament. the
Grinnellsphants played with a five man,
two woman line, which Hansen felt was
to Grinnell's advantage. “Our women play
extremely well, so in a coed tournament
we often have the advantage over other
teams," he said.

“We were able to apply what we learned
in practice and were really able to 5:: how
we should work together as a team," he
added. “Everything cam: together very well
that weekend "

Glausser said she feels that the Windy
City tournament really helped the Stickies
in their playing at Winona. “Chicago gave
the new women an introduction to tourna»
msnr play. Playing with men made us more
aggressive. helped us to better understand
how the ﬂow ofthc game works, and really
challenged us to play at the top ofour game.
This carried over into Hallowinona," she
said,

The Grinncllcphans will play at a smaller
tournament this weekend in lower City to
and the club season before they move indoors
to train for the spring season.

Men’s rugby loses 28-7

by Erik Anderson
Men's Rugby Team

Despite continued improvement in their
back—line play, Grinnell was defeated by
Luther 28.7. Strong defense, brilliant sup.
port, effective ball control and Riclrelicu's
decision to lend French support helped to
ensure a Lutheran victory.

Grinnell’s only score was by Eric “St.
Bartholomcw's Day" Hartz off a pass by
Justin “Linear Ab inlirio” Flanders, who
created the attack by running back Luther
player Huldricch Zwingli’s kick for over
50 meters.

Grant “Wallenstein” McCall '02,
wreaked havoc on the Lutherans of north-
ern ocrmany while Greg "Caraffa" Weiss '03,
turned some heads when he both employed

somcsweet spin moves and combated abuses
and immorality while remaining rigidly con.
strvativc on matters ofdocrrine.

scvcrsl Grinnell players, such as Ben
“Trent" Buclow '02, objected to the offi.
cisting ofthe match, speciﬁcally in regards
to the refs failure to penalize Luther for
employing too many/"theses and for their
high tackling.

Firstetimt player Mike “lgnatius" Zabel
’03, using both his fantastic speed and his
blind acceptance of papal dogma, played a
strong game as both fullback and educator
ofa ncw Catholic elite. One of the more
impressive plays of the game was when
“iguatius” ran down his own kick to deliver
adcvastatlng tackle ofthc opposing fullback
