Propaganda: Dripping . Out

Dear Mom, _
Something very strange dropped into
my mailbox last Friday 7 not a letter,
but a pamphlet. Now, that's not
unusual; we get many pieces of paper
in our boxes, but this was written to the
students by some other students about
students. I read it, vaguely agreed with
it, and then stopped short. What? I look-
ed over the pamphlet again. It was
becoming, well, silly. The message was
simple — Grinnell is shaping us into
what it waan and not what we want 7
and this is bad. I could agree with that;
i feel a bit shaped by everything. But
Grinnell “is a place for indoctrination
in the ways of American life.” I always
thought mat was what the family did.
_ and, if it failed, well, the 12 years oi
public education did the rest. But Grin<
nell”! l have always viewed Grinnell as
my one chance to figure out what exact-
ly you, Dad, TV., and public education
did to me. No otlense intended, Mom,
really. Grinnell, with all its flaws and
deceit, is still a rather unusual school 7
it is in Iowa, it tolerates rugby players,
and the people are somewhat in-
telligent. It is not unique, perhaps. but i
think ‘pretty but bland’ is an overstate-
merit.

The authors move next the question
Grinnell’s “lack of community," There
are approximately 1100 students here 7
I don t want to know all of them: in fact,
i in quite happy just to know the people
on my floor A community cannot be
forced on a group of people. It is, by it
nature, small and intimate. Certainly, a
school of Grinnell's size cannot be
"flexible and supportive." at least, not
as live or six friends can be and are.
Many activities are provided to bring
the school together, but unfortunately,
many students feel the library is more
exciting,

, The next paragraph just makes an era
roneous statement. “We’re learning
now to supplant our own desires with
the desire to live ‘as we should‘; to
value security, possessions,
closedness." As with indoctrination. we
learned these values long ago in our
own homes, If the majority of the
students are, as I suspect of middle
class origin, we learned from our
parents to respect and value material

. goods. We learned not to steal, to earn
spending money doing whatever we
could, and to accept the idea that we
would someday work and support
ourselves. The authors also argue that
we allow our work to “consume our
lives." Such obsession with one's work
and interests is not always had; lwould
say that it is indeed the only way
anything or creative value is produced.
One cannot be ‘laid back' and write
Crime and Punishment.

The pamphlet goes on to make yet
another unjust statement: there is no
channel tor the expression of ‘posltive

human energy.‘ What are the Dance
Troupe, the crafts workshops. Col-
legium, DSOC, GORP, and other
groups doing? I always thought they exn
isted to allow students to express their
creativity and feelings. I don't know 7
maybe I’m wrong. There is certainly
room for expansion, but once again, the
authors overstate their case.

Now Mom, I'm not totally disagrees
ing with what these folks are saying.
Learning is often a passive process
here — but it is only Grinnell’s fault, or,
perhaps, are we also to blame? The
grading system needs to be revised or
done away With 7 but the faculty, ad-
ministration, and students must find
some common ground, instead of
meeting separately and inetiectively. i
guess my biggest complaint with the
massage oi this pamphlet is that it at
fers no concrete alternatives. The tone
is quite nice, the sentiments well ex-
pressed, but we need something more

ourselves and getting in touch with our
ieelings. Grinnell is a good school with
an interesting student body and an
overtly aggressive admissions depart-
ment. We used to have a responsive ad-
ministration -— now we have one deter»
mined to mold Grinnell into a ‘good’
school, regardless of what the students
want. This is sad. but. short oi parental
intervention or a tuition strike, there is
little we can do to influence what they
do. We can, however, examine what we
are taught, attempt to understand what
is wrong with ourselves, and tumble our
way out of Grinnell and into the a world
where we can change what we {ind
disagreeable and contrary to our
belieis. The pamphlet seems to me to be
as narrowmlnded in its own way as the
institutions and people it criticizes. I
lost hope that, in pursuing our goals, we
do not try to force our ideas and goals

,on others.

Love, Jeff

Dear Jeff,

And what about your roommate? . . ,

The Five Year Plan

How can I tell you how much I love you”! You tease me with ‘.
the Kissane'course I never had, the Reid test I never took, the; .
Dobbs paper I never wrote, and the Wall seminar I never
shared. You seduce me with your musical ability and with your"
quantum mechanics. Though it may seem strange, my is
norance brings me great joy, for I step into the world excited by ‘

that I have yet to learn. My one regret is that I will not learn it ’ '

all here. .
. There have been advantages to spending four and one- -half

‘ years here. The biggest was finding out what it‘s like to study
hard for an entire semester. After having fun with my educa-
tion during the first four years, I’m appalled at the pressure you .
people put yourselves through for the entire stretch. Come to ‘
think of it, I’ve rarely taken a ”study break” — I always felt
that there were good reasons for pursuing other pursuits, aside
from relieving tension.

Think about it Are you nearing the end? Can’t wait to “get it
over with?" Finally “sick with school?” Well, you’ve missed
the boat. Are you a freshman, already looking towards law
school? You ve probably missed it, too.

To the rest of you. remember, take your eyes off the future
now and then and have some fun. I hope Grinnell will be
everything for you that it has been for me (for you are
Grinnell). You have been my sore muscles and my cold brews.
You have been my 98 papers and my 14 computer programs.
You have been my academic probation and my senior thesis.
You have been my life.

 

What do you want for Christmas?
