‘Gl‘innellian China

Don Fesslor, ’31, was apprehensive
as to the outcome of the invasion of
Manchuria by the Japanese when he
sent Christmas letters to Grinnell
friends weeks ago, At that time.
the ternLory about Peking was in
panic.

Jefferson academy. at which Mr.
Fessler is new teaching, is near Peks
ing which has been under martial law
for some time and where Chinese stu-
dents havc enforced the economic
boycott against Japanese goods.

In speaking of the boycott be
praised the Chinese efforts very
highly, “It is primarily the students
who are cni 'ing on the anti-Japanese
boycott throughout China,” he said,
"They have the power of the police
behind them, out it is due to their
vigilance in searching out unpatriotic
dealers in Japanese goods, that the
boycott is being carried across suc»
cessfully.

“students from both our boys‘ and
girls’ schools go to the city gates ev-
ery day to inspect all goods carried
through them. The stores which or-
Itlinarily carry a great deal of Japan-
ese goods of certain kinds are being
required to store away all of the for—
bidden articles. In her extremely
weak condition China has only the
boycott as a weapon with which to
fight and it is the students who are
making that weapon successful."
