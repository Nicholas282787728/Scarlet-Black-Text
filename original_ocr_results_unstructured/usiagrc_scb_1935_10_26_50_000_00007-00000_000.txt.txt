Strict Discipline of ‘Czair’s Army
Still Observed by Cossacks

¥ l
Singer Heavily Penalized
for Missing Even
One Phaclice

Can you believe that there exists
a group of men, some of whom are
almost seven feet tall, all of whom
are at least thirty years old, who
would rather sing than cat or
sleep 7

Such men as these compose the
Russian Don Cossack choir, which
will sing here Wednesday night as
the opening number of the Gl'inncll
recital course.

Strict Discipline

After 12 years of singing, they
still observe the same strict disclr

Clark Explains
Football Mystery

Tells Why All-Americans
Fail in Pro Game

Detroit. Mich—(ACPi—Earl 0.
”Dutch” Clark, quarterback of the
Detroit Lions, and considered by
many criticsone of the greatest
players now in the game, offers an
explanation of one of football's
most baffling mysteries.

Sports Writers and fans alike
have wondered why many “big
names" stars have failed to make
the grade in the pro game while
players rosters of major profes-
sional leagues are filled with names
of men whose collegiate experience
was with obscure teams repre»
senting smaller institutions.

Pm Game Tough
"Pro football is much tougher
than the college game,” Clark says,
“very much tougher, A lot or
people have the idea. that the pros
lack the physical condition of the
coilegiates. That’s out. We start
practice more than a month before
our first game.

“,We work two hours a day with
both morning and afternoon drills,
and in the heat of summer, too. No
college team undergoes such rigor-

, ous pre-season practice. That's
where the boys from the smaller
schools show up to advantage.
They are eager to make good, and
bustle more, and they’re not al-
ways thinking about past reputa-
tions."

Always in Condition

Clark cited "Cowboy” Jack John-
son, formerly of Utah university,
tackle for the Detroit Lions, as an
example ”of the type of ,player who
makes good in professional foot-
bail,

“He's the best conditioned man
I have ever seen in football,” Clark
said. ,"I-Ie plays a full sixty min-
utes at top speed and after the
game, when the rest of us are all
tuckcred out, he’s as fresh as a
daisy. From the end of one sea-
son to the start of another, Jack
is on his ranch, and he‘s always as
hard as nails."

Feathers Great Back

Beattie Feathers of the Chicago
Bears, former University of Ten~
nessee star is, in Clark's estima»
tion, the finest running back in
football.

“If they come any better than
Feathers, I would like to see
them," he said. ”He is elusive, not
exceptionally fast, but when he has
to bull his way through the pack,
has the power to make extra

 

yards.”

Cza s army in which they once
served,

The greatest tragedy that can
befall one of these singing Rus-
sians is to be forced to foiego one
of his concerts, the penalty for
missing one rehearsal. Only once
since the organization of the group
has any member of the Don Cos-
sacks received the severest of pun-
ishments.

- Large iteperioire

This organization has an almost
unbelievably large repertoire. Thc
singers seldom recharse when on a
tour, but each year sees a com
plete change of program which is
rehearsed for five hours a day
during a six weeks annual stay on
the Riviera.

It is interesting to note the oc»
cupations these 36 mcn pursued
before they joined the choir. Only
the leader, Serge Jar-off, was a
professional musician. The others
were doctors, lawyers, engineers,
teachers, business men and landed
royalty who combined their efforts
to make the Don Cossack chorus a
possibility.

language Professor

One of them was formerly a pro-
fessor of Oriental languages hav-
ing acquired a knowledge of 22 of
those forgotten tongues. Another
is a fcnncr general of all the
armies of South Russia, while a
third owned an estate approxi-
mately twice the size of the state
of New York.

Thus revolution and music have
acted as great levelers. Wedness
day night former princes and m
lionaires will be found singing
side by side.

Hensley Describes
Mountaineers’ Customs

Shakespearian‘ language and
Elizabethan customs of the North
Carolina mountain people were de-
scribed by Mrs. Elizabeth Hensley.

“The mountain people are the
only ones who have learned how to
use their leisure time.” the speak—
er declared seriously. They sit on
their porches and contemplate the
natural beauty of the country by
the hour, but she does not consid—
er them shiftiess, for they manage
to have enough to eat and to~wear
and are contented with their lot.

Through the skill they have ac»
quired in weaving and pottery
making, the mountain people are
finding a means to express their
love of beauty which has no other
outlet.

Mrs. Hensley taught weaving,
pottery and pewter craft in the
mountain school, and later exhibit
ed and sold the handiwork at the
Century of Progress exposition.

She showed slides Thursday
night of her pupils at work, most
of them married women who send
their children through Berea coir
legs with the money they earn
through weaving. As an example
of their work she displayed a col-
orful, handwoven smock with a
border copied from an'old monk’s
belt.
