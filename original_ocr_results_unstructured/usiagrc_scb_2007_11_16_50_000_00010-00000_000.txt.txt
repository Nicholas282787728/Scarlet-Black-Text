AWeekend in he Ll‘le

There's no better way to assess whether substance-free
students feel included and comfortable on campus than to
try Living the sub-free lifestyle first-hand. With that noble
sociological-journalistic goal in mind, I spent last weekend

.solitlly sober and in search orevenrs where fun was the key
word.

SOBER WEEKEND EVENT #1: Bake Cookies

I began my substance-tree weekend by screwing it up
and drinking two glasses ofwine after class on Friday while
-I baked chocolate cookies. Ijusljfy this with the logic that
a) ifyou had been in my classes on Friday, you would have,
too, and b) Iwas stiu sober,l swear, Cooking is an under-
rated social activityiit brings people together, it results
in delicious foods, its 100 percent wholesome, relaxing
and noncompetitive. Making pies, cookies and soap is my
favorite thing to do at Grinnell besides sleeping, imbibe
ing ofdrinks and engaging in stimulating discussion about
race and/or class. All dorms have kitchens, and all kitchens
should be frequently filled with relatively sober students
enjoying one another’s friendship,

SOEER WEEKEND EVENT #2: Play handball at
wacky Friday Weekend Wellness

RLC Jennifer Bieniek greeted a friend and I at the
PEG racquetball courts with a beaming grin, a bag of tiny
bouncy halls, enough Capri suns to go around and, intro
plicilbly, glow in the dark body paint. Bieniek encouraged
us to paint. our faces, snag some Capri Sims and play an
energizing game or handball, even though the friend I'd
dragged along and l were two ofthc only tour people at the
event. Twenty minutes later, my face streaked with neon
pink and my handreye coordination slightly improved, Yd
had enough wacky sobriety and thanked Bieniek for her

time and enthusiasm.

SOBER WEEKEND EVENT #3: Go to a concert

Backin the day, I danced sober all the timeil’d forgot—
ten how self-conscious nonstipsy dancing is but, even with
the acute knowledge that OH MY GOD I LOOK RI-
DICULOUS, the Aqueduct show was a good time. People
were more sweaty than drunk and whenever I got too sick
of moving in the midst of crushing body odor, I could slip
to the dark, unoccupied back parts ofCardnet.

SOBER WEEKEND EVENT #4: Hanging out on
ClevelandThird

Watching people rave dance can only really be appreci—
ated by rhe sober.

SOBER WEEKEND EVENT #5: Stay late in the li-
brary

The library gers eerie after six on d‘ie weekends. I
thought I would hunch over a computer in the basement in
solidarity with all the other substance-free Saturday night
studicrs, but the only other person in the computer lab was
drinking whiskey straight from the bottle.

SOBER WEEKEND EVENT #6: Play Catchphrase!

Almost as wholesome as baking cookies, catchphrase
is the rare game which is fun for the sober and intoxicated
alike. I’ve played Catchphrase with prospies, I’ve played
catchprase with drug dealers, l've played Catch hrase
with Professor Pablo SilvaHistory: everyone loves catch—
phrase. Saturday night it was at a birthday party where all
we did was play Catchphrase for several hours. I had ans
other two glasses of wine that don’t count.

SOBER WEEKEND EVENT #7: Go to a High Sr.
P““)’

I'd forgotten what it's like to be so self-conscious dur—
ing parties, acutely aware of where everyone is standing,
what they're saying, whar your dancing looks like. During
my substancei‘rce years, High Street parties were always
more awkward than anything and l stood with my arms
crosscd a lot. I actually found myself having fun. Digging
up good conversationalists and keeping your beerrempty
hands busy are key. i ate so bags orgummi bears and dis
cussed the perfect items with which ro till a pinata (winner:
pudding),

SOBER WEEKEND EVENT #24: Breakfast

wake up in the morning and feel really amazing because
you're not hung over at all, then go out to AstI and eat
yourselfsick and greasy

Living the substance-free
life for a weekend

To assess the college’s substance-free lifestyle, known lover of alcohol
Sarah Mirk returns one weekend to her sober roots, giving an account of
how the sub-free part of the college feels, and her own weekend account

BY SARAH MlRK

one year ago this month, I gor wasted for rhe very ﬁrst
time. It involved margaritas. It was great. Though I spent my
underclass years staunchly substancesfl‘ee, I, like many Grins
nelljans, have became more
comfortable with the idea of
inebriarion since coming here,
with not having to be the class
role model anymore, growing
up, meeting people and meeting
the aforementioned margari-
tas, etc. etc. A hefty portion of
Grinnsllllln57‘lf the dcmand
for sub-free housing is an indie
carol—live relatively substance
free.

”We want [a provide up-
iionsonmmpus. Yourah
have fun Without alcohol.
The keyword of lime
events it fun.”

RLC Jennifer Bieniek

The school balances
irs admirably lax alcohol policy with a slew ofsuhstancesftee
events. RLC Jennifer Bionick heads the student Weekend
Wellness Committee which coordinnres alcohol-free events
every Friday night attended by a varying number ofstudcnts:
200 turned our for the Weekend Wellness bonﬁre hosrccl by
1.5.0., but between is and do show up for the more typical
Bingo or Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) arrairs. “We want
to provide options on campus,"erplains Bienick “You can have
run wirhour alcohol.Thc keyword orthese events isﬁml" SGA
ﬁlms and concctrs are also highly atreudcrl, technically suhrftcc
events.

l<ylc Blair '10, who lives in subsrancc-rrcc kershuw, thinks
the school does a “really good job" otreiing inclusive events
where he and his friends reel comtortablc whether they’re
drinking or, as is usually the case, nrc staying sober. “1 go to the
big Hains parties, concerts, movies," Blair explains. He and his
tricnds will also just hang out on weekend nights, looking at
the stars or playing charades or watching a movie in rhc lounge,
like they did on 10/10.

snrnh Evans '10,who lives down the hall from lilnir. agrees
rhnr there's plenty ro do tor sub-free kids. Though she doesn't
go to many parties, Evans stlys she feels “wally comfottnhlc"ilt
Grinncll, especially with a srroug community oflikermlndcd,
bccr»scorning friends who are up for spending Friday nighrjust
talking or watching a movie.

on Blail and Evans' hull hangs a colorful board or indey
cards written during a “Post Secret"Weekcud Wcllncss evcnr

thrown by Kershaw students with the encouragement of their
RLC, Bienick.

Kai Hill '09,who drinks only wine (and only rarely), agrees
that she feels comfortable and included on campus, but has
never lived in a sub-free dorm and doesn't attend Weekend
Wellness evenrs."1 think they're kind orlame," she says. “They
think suhrftcc means you like to play DDR.”

Although Clam Thclcn ’08 says she’s “deﬁnitely not come
fortablc with hard drinking culture", she, too, has never felt
the need to attend the specifically subefrce Weekend Wellness
cvcnrs. “It seems like having something to do for rhc people
who nren’r cool enough to dnnk,"she laughs.

But Thclcn believes that building a group of nonsdtinking
friends is key ro being happy at Gnnnell. “You need to find the
tight pcoplpnon-pnrriersmityou don't, it can be tough,"she
says, admitting rhar ir took her a while to find a group with
whom she connected after she transferred from St. John's Cole
lege. “You know where rhe parties are,” she explains, “but you
don’t know where the parties aren't.”

The black and white categories of S|llJSlilnCC*fl’¢c versus
substance indulgence are somewhat misleading and unhelpful,

since many students consume selective] v7
drinks every once in a while or
yes, alcohol, no, drugs. People
like me who were crazy in high
school and swore ortpain killers
and Coffee as well is cigarertcs,
drugs and alcohol make up nr
one and of the substance—use
specnum while serious alcos
holics lie at the other, but most
Grinncllians fall somewhere in
rhc middle, drinking occasions
ally and sometimes, memorably,
to excess. Blair, for example, identiﬁes as “substance-free" “1,
though he’s had it few beers this your.

Christine Blucknel Y08, who drinks occilsiotmlly now but
says the drinks she had freshman year could be counted on
one hand, reels rhar when someone says they're substancesftcc,
many people assume rhc disapprove ofnlcohol and might not
be comfortable around it. “I don’t like to put people into Cats
cgoiies of substnnct‘rftcc or subsrancc-full," Bruckner notes. “I
think drinking is a good thing in .uodcrarion, it‘s a choice i
rnnkc but not a crutch."

”/ think they’re kind of
iame they think subs
