DEEATING UNION MEETING.

.l very animated meeting was held
by tho Debating Union in the Chapel
Tuesday evening. The chiet question
at discussion was, whom we should de-
bate this year. Several letters ilitd
been received i'rom other schools who
desired to promulgate debating
tracts with us, among whom
Fayette, Simpson, Dl'rtlie,Amcs and
Cornell. Direct challenges were re-
ccivcd ircm Simpson And Cornell.
However the only LWD propositions
seriously considered were those born
times and Cornell College. There was
some reeling among the members in
later 5i Incu'dihgnll intercourse with
our old iivi , Cornell, and considering
dines. Iiowerertiielinnl iotc went

swords with lier.‘ A committee was
appointed to considerthc move more
thoroughly and to draw up a compact.
