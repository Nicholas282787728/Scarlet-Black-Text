“Hefty” Coeds

'WiII Diet; Seek

“Super Figures”

By Lois Stewart.
Are you overweight too?

Extra avoirdupois will fall off
‘su the coeds hope—in a miracur
lous manner when the diet tables
at the quad begin. Beginning to-
night, curvaceous beauties will
look longingly at the heaping
plates of their skinnier sisters and
sigh in envious regret.

But hopes of becoming stream-
lined inake them straighten up
and say, “We have wdl power."
And with another sigh, they will
fall to their food: a modification
of the regular dietifl'uit for rich
desserts, wafers for bread, green
vegetables for potatoes.

There will be no sneaking in a
“coke" between meals or aspread
after hours because the wccldy
weight chart will tattle if the
pounds are not disappearing.

So, in spite of that certain
gaunt feeling for the first few
days, coed chubbies will restrain
themselves, and blossom forth——

Survey Interviews With Employers in Three Cities Shows
Tllai “Adequate Opportunity” Awaits College Graduates

 

By Charles Adams.

Employers in three cities, Chica-
go, Dcs Moines and Minneapolis,
described the opportunities in al-
most every type of business and
industry to some 34 Grinnell col-
lege students who participatedin
the fifth annual job survey held
during spring vacation,

By far the largest group of
students was included in the Chie
cago survey where 53 men and
women had more than 300 intern
views arranged for them by the
Chicago alumni committee. Sig-
nificant in this year’s survey
was the large number of undere
classmen participating, 17 soph.
omores and juniors beingincluded
in the Chicago group alone.

in addition to the 70 firms co-
operating with the prearranged
intervrews, a large number be-
came the object of “cold” inter-
views arrangcd by the surveyors
upon their own initiative.

Minneapolis and Des Moines,
the other cities in which formal
surveys were conducted drew 12
and 14 students respectively.
Following the trend of past
years, vocational advice given to

students was as varied as it was
Valuable. Perhaps the most im—‘
poitant question popped by the
students concerned the actual
value of a college education inl
getting a job. Here, in most in-
stances, the information received
was pleasant; for the majority of
employers termed a college eduv
cation almost a prerequi te for a.
good job and even more impor-
tant as a kind of accelerator in
advancement after the job has
been obtained,

The superiority of a liberal ed-
ucation over a more narrow tech-
nical training was also stressed
by several employers. It was
pointed out that the ,student is
often forced to enter a vocation
far different from that in which
he has received his college train.
ing. In such cases, the value of
a broad educational background.
remains largely unchanged, while
that of a purelyﬁechnicdl knowle
edge is decreased.

Although actual reports of job
finding were few, the leads ob-
tained and contacts made on the
survey were numerous. or even
more value was the advice, to
some disillusioning, that the par-

 

,-ticiilai field in which they weie
inteiested was largely static if
not actually contracting in scope.
One employed claimed that his
firm had not employed a new
man in ten years. Because of this
situation it was suggested that
other fields be investigated be»
fore deciding too definitely upon
a vocation, .

In contrast were the rosy pic-
tures of opportunity for all col-
lege graduates who are able to
sell their assets to potential eme
ployers. an employer is interest-
ed in an applicant for a job larger
1y because he may be a financial
asset to the company, and forno
other reason.

constructive ideas, which
many cases can come only
through the injection of new
blood into an industry oi busi~
ness, are always being sought by
employers. The person who can
prcsent these ideas, who can
show that he has been successful
in his college career, and who evi-
dences a pleasing personality and
a desire to work will find ade-
quate opportunity in America to-

day.
