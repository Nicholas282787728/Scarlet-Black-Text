The Grinnell Griffins spent last Sunday
in Pella at Central College's Tulip Tourna-
ment, in which tour schools participated:
Central College, North East Missouri State
University, Cornell College, and Grinnell
College
The iirst match was the grueling Grin»
nell vs. Central match. The Central team
lived up to its reputation of being a team
whose game plan is simply “to play the
man,” Grinnell played well against Cens
ti-al's iootbali players, but lost 370 due to a
penalty kick in this hot-tempered game,
Back Chris Knoepﬂe came close to throw
ing punches after he was mysteriously
,punched in the groin area alter being
tackled As to why Knoeplle became so
upset. ireshman rugby prodigy Dave
Gerard replied, “You gotta protect what’s
yours." Another player was picked up oil
the ground by the neck and almost killed
when he described the similarities Shared
by one of Central's largest players and an
anal orifice. The description had come in
response to an unprovoked blindstded hit
to him while he was iogging across the
field to the ball,
in speaking ot the superb job the pack
dld. senior Alex Dracobly commented,
“We Couldn't have lost more than one
serum." The team had a little trouble run
ning the ball up field thanks to the Central

The second game played was evenly
matched with Central playing North East
Missouri State. When time ran out and the
score was still do. the game went into
overtime with the two teams playing
“sevens," a variation ot rugby where both
teams play with seven men instead oi the
standard l5. The exciting final minutes
brought a 40 N.E.M.S,U. win. Everyone
was ecstatic. including the Griffin's coach
and inspiration, Joe Phipps, who was
retereemg the game. As he walked off the
field at half-time, Joe said in reference to
Central's team, “Talk about a bunch of
assholes,"

Grinnell played Cornell College's newly
established Rugby Club in the third game
ol the day. which was also Cornell's third
game ever. Everyone was surprised when
they showed up wearing uniforms idenr
tical to the Griffins‘; so as not to confuse
Cornell. the Griffins borrowed some
jerseys from Central and N.E,M.S.U. Corr

the already tired Griffins. Cornell had a
pack made up oi some very heavy tor-
wards who often pushed over or Collapsed

"I was disappointt'rl that we didn't play
well early," commented Coach Gar Smith
"We seemed to drift in the early matches.

proved It wasn‘t because we didn't have

such as tacuity turnover and overcrowded
housing, which may turn potential
students away from Grinnell. Matteson
disagreed, saying, ”I've never felt any
pressure" about saying or not saying
things, He added that “Admissions prefers
that we softrpedal GCGC. but they've
never told me ‘don't talk about this,’ " A
disappointment of Nancy Suggs‘ tour was
that She never saw the Pub, which was
where the students "hung out" at that
time. Willis was not sufficiently introduced
to Fine Arts, and Master did not see the
PEC.

Suggs also feels that the expectations ac-
cumulated while one is a prospective often
differ from the realities of being a “real”
college student, She was shown a “huge"
threerroom triple as a representation at
"the typical room.”

The openness of Grinnell's campus often
impresses the Visiting student. For exam-
ple, ireshman Vicki Oettel reported that
"they emphasized that you could be an in»
dividual" when she visited, ”I thought
everyone was free and easy," said Oettel.
though she now sees that "everyone is a lit

Master discovered that “it is not as open-
minded as I thought.”

Another "glorified” reality involves the
amount or influence students really have
on the aministration and decrsions made
by the school, While Hopkins said, “I think
students have a lot more input at this
school, when compared to others.” both
Matteson and Suggs expressed opposing ,
views, siiggs, being specific, i'elt “disillu-
sinned” in that she “always thought the
administration was more susceptible to
student influence."

Rue, in reference to the school’sinability
to keep young protessors on campus,
thinks “that's one area that Grinnell
bushes-up about.” Other areas mentioned
in that context were freshman over-
crowding, and the legitimacy of the adver-
tised facultysstudent ratio of eleven to one,

“I think we are realistic about What
Grinnell is," said Matteson. “What have
we got to lose from telling the truth?" AC-
cording to Rue. “We‘re trying to get
students to enroll here, I think maybe
sometimes 'they're getting some
misperceptions about Grinnell " ()n the
other hand, Hopkins believed that "tour
