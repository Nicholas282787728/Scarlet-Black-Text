DR. STEINER NEXT TUESDAY.

The Second Number of the Course Will
be a Strong and Inspiring
Lecture.

Tuesday night we will have the
privilege of listenlng to one of
noblest men and most interesting
talkers that ever came to Grin-
nell. It was only on account ofa
personal friendship with a mem-
ber of tlle faculty that Dr, Steiner
could be persuaded to tavor us
with his presence, his work being
usually conﬁned to colleges and
larger churches in the eastern
centers of population and learns
ing. His friendship for our col-
lege is well known. Probably no
lecturer could be named who is as
full of his subject as is Dr. Steiner
He only speaks of things which
have come under his pelsmtttl
notice and which he more
oughly studied. During
eventful lllt: has travelled.
studied, worked, and thought
among the peoplc whom he de-
scribes in llls lectures. and whose
inmost character he knows so well.

The art of Demosthenes and of
Cicero has always inﬂuenced peer
pie. The nature of our social
and political life demands the
continuation of the art which
sways assemblies and moulds
sentiment. The English speaking
race has produced some of the
world’s best orators and debaters.
Some of the best speakers of the
west have received their training
in colleges which are members of
