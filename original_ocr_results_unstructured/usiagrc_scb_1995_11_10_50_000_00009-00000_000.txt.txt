time occurrence,[didn't pay it much
attention, Then I was invited to go
see The Neton Saturday, and I real<
ized that there is something very
wrong st Harris these days (aside
from the fact that people still throw
parties there). People have told me
that it isn’t really much ofa movlei
it‘s lacking in plot. dialogue, plausi—
hility and clintacter development. 1
can't say rot sure whether any orthat
is correct or not. I can‘t even recall
whether there was a good soundtrack
or not, since I couldn‘t hear it. All
loansay is their I saw something that
was supposed to be The Net, and that
it strongly resembled a (silent) dark
gray blob.

To use a phrase i once swore I

used to have to wait for them to
change the reels at least twice for
every movie. Sometimes the “inter

the same, so let's put Harris to good
use for a change. Let's do something
a little different.

Women Take Back the Night
To the Editor:

This is in response to last iicelr's
letlel totheeditorahouxWomenTnke
Bart the Night (\VTETN).

The fact that it seems that men
are not interested in the goals of \VT«
BTN is asatl fact, butagooddeal ofrhis
is \he fault ofhow WTBTN has been
handled in the last row years. As a
male, a feminist and a survwor. \X/T—
BTN has been more of a headache
than a torm orempoivrrmcnt In past
years PAFA has been callous to the
affects that some of their demonstra-
tions have had on the verypeoplerhey
were purporting to protect (i.c. Survi»
vorsofsexualabuse). Thrsyear, thank<
fully, the whistleblowmg demonstra-
tion was avoided, but the damaging
effects that it had (and PAFA's callous
attitude about those effects) caused
WTBTN to lose a number orsupporr.
ers. male and female.

The exclusionary nature of the
WTBTN events has further disillu»
sioncd a number of male feminists
about the goals and tactics used in
WTBTN. The message that males
receive is that they are Bad and Evrl
Creatures that do not deserve to march
next to women in a cause that they
support. instead of bringing people
together in cooperation in order to
effect a positive change, WTBTN has
sent a message orsegregation and elite
ism. Itimpliesthar mencannotunderr
stand sexual abuse (with which I, as a
survivor, tnilydrsagree), and that wom~
en cannot and do not want to deal
with this issue in a coopemllve man—
ner with men

Withthlssortofatmospbere.does
it really seem that odd [that] many
men do not want to take part |n WT—
BTN? Especially when men are told
outright that the women do not want
them in “their” demonstration? The
segregation and almost blatant sexism
has turned a demonstration with good
intentions into a wedge between men
and women interested in feminist goals.
As the authors of the prevrous letter
pointed out, “Rape, sexual abuse and
domestic violence are not only wom—
en’s rssues;" they are human issues.
Active alrenatronofapproximately half
of the populace of the campus is not
the way to foster cooperation. And,
that cooperation definitely [does not]
come about when we are advrsed to
“accept [our] position as oppressors."
Men need to not accept a position as
oppressors. to buy into the idea that
men are uncontrollable beasts that do
nothing but harm women. When men
need to do is accept their position as
equals with all people, no matter their
gender or whatever other Categorizar
tion you choose to use. If WTBTN
would promote the ideaol’ people com—
ing together to fight rape, sexual abuse
and domestic violence, as opposed to
just vocal women ﬁghting the patriar<
chy in which men are seen as nothing
but helpless tools. then you will see
more men supporting WTBTN.

Dear Editor:

I am a third/yam student at Grin—
nell College and have been receiving
issues of the Scarlet & BIack while

studying inCnsta Ricathissemestcr. I
have noticed that there have been
several articles pertaining to "multi.
cultural lssues,"and would like iogivc
my two ccnls’ worth

Being biracial. I consider myself
quite, in a word, multicultural
Throughout my lirei have struggled to
fit into one ethnic group or the other,
yer knowing all the while that parts of
me identified with one, the other, or
both This sense Ofbelonglng, howey.
er, was not easily achieved I was
continually plagued \vrth stinging, in—
sensitive questions “Were you adopt»
cdi”, "Who is your real motitz". “Why
do youtryto actso whiter" Obviously,
the society I grcw up in was not very
open to the many ways I could have
come into the world. The reason I “act
so white," I assume, is because it’s half
my lierimgel

I never retorted to these questions
very eloquently, and this always made
me feclsouncomfortable and untouch»
able: adifferent sort ofoutsider with no
centi-rlplacetnsociety, Iwouldlike to
thank and commend aIlGrrnneII Colt

spect and intelligence, and above all
for never making me relive those hot—
rlble days. Never once have I had a

sayingivhat I felt and having all this he
iudged by the color or my sitin. I am
thrilled atGrady Murdock'sdefinition
oran-areness as exploring the diversity
within the Black culture. At the same
time I am not disregardingthe feelings
of other multicultural students. I am
only saying from my experiences at
Grinnell College [that] I am proud of
the number of students who are aware
but not color blind. Yes, I am black
and I am white. but most importantly.

“United Statesians?”
Dear Editor:

You know what really irks me!
The way we, the people of the United
States,conttnuallyrefertoourselvesas

They're “American" roo’ Remember

BlackeAfricaneAmcrican thing?

guess those terms make me feel a little
bit better, hut nothing makes my skin

It’s a lot like the whole waiter/\vaittess/

Democrats and Registration
To the Editor:

lliaveoltipysthoughtthatitwotild
be a good idea for Grinnell students to
register to vote in orinnell during
their four year stay. This would iiiiite
Otit‘inellCollegestutlenisarountlcer—
tain town and Iowa issues and estab—
lish a stronger connection between
the college and the town. it surprised
me that so few students took advan<
tngc orthis opportunity However, in
my desperate attempts to get informa»
tion about how to register to vote in
the last two months, I think I have
discovered one of the reasons for this.

When I began my registration
search, I was completely in the dark
about lowa registration procedure. I
startedby emailing the Campus Dem—
ocrats and asking where I could regis-
ter to vote. I would have been happy
iftheysimply gave me anaddtcssdown.
town They told me that they would
send me a card to register with along
with someother information. Amonth
passed and I received no card or any
explanation for the delay. I wrote the
Democmtsagtiinand thistime received
no reply whatsoever. IcalledtheStew—
art Library and got anaddress of aplace
to register in town, but I was still
counting on using the more conve
nienrand lesstimeconsuming card, I
emailedaknowncampus activrstper—
sonally aboutgettingacard and got no
reply. I finally Visited the Stewart
Library and got one ofthe fabled cards.
I cannot come up with any logical
explanation why an organized campus
political group could neitherputacard
in the mail nor have the courtesy to
amwer my messages and tell me why
they could not do this.

I hope the Campus Democmts’
voter registration drive goes well. It
should send the message to the campus
that they are an involved and respon—
sive organization which wishes to in—
crease voter registration; a message
very different than the one they have
sent me in the past two months. I find
it interesting that a group of peopleI
which in the past couple years has
frequently wondered why so few stu—
dents attend their meetings, chose to
ignore someone making a deliberate
effort to reachout to them for informa—
tion.

smcerely,
