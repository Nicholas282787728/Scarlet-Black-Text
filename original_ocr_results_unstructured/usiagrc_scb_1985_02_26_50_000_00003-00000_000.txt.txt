‘The sea VicesPresident must convey

s‘tudent opinion to the administration con»

erning issues such as the eiiect ot the

Ydsyr sold drinking age. the adoption oi a

“minor” degree. and whether SGA is a tru»
1y representative body.

Though I have argued that SGA is in-
c‘apable oi representing the student body
regarding national/international political
issues. the referendum system which I
supported as a Hall President ensures
Joint Board's proper iocus on campus
issues while allowing students to voice
their News on extra-campus attairs. As a

member oi the subcommittee which is
reviewing the administratmn’s proposal to
eliminate Hall PresidenB in iavor oi “at
large,” senators, 1 question who would
represent dorms on dorm issues (party
budgets, etc.t and how senators could be
held responsible to their constituents, i do
ieel. however. that one “at large"
representative irom each side oi campus
could be added to increase JB's “represens
tativeness."

Cooperation with the administration is.
however, necessary to iormulate a new
alcohol policy. 1 ieel such cooperation was

exempliiied by CSL’s deliberations on the
new drinking age and the continuation oi
Relays. A liberal alcohol policy can be
achieved it vigorously iought ior by both
.13 and the SGA Cabinet.

My involvement with student govern-
ment as Judicial Council alternate and
PASF member has convinced me that an

' energetic person actively concerned about

the needs of the student body can make a
beneﬁcial difference. I would like to make
this difference as VicesPresident.

Let's face it: the SGA won‘t Just disaps
