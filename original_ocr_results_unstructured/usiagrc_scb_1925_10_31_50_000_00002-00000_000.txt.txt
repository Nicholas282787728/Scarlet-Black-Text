Fred Derring. the farmer, and tho

irom that mass of yokelry, who have
hardly enough sensations to amount
to selfqlreservation. He is not drawn
in caricature. His abilities are not
underestimated. He is a common
tanner who realizes he is being over—
run by crooked politicians and grain
merchants and who is powerless to
aid himseli. He can do nothing but
curse his ill fortune and talk big talk
