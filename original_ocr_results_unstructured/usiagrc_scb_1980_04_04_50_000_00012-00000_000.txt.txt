/“" Big Business Day is coming “W kadden

A list of sins: Plant shutdowns
which disrupt whole communities, unv
justified‘inflating profits, a serious
lack oi concern ior product and
workplace safety, antirunionism, pollu
tion of natural resources, misleading
advertising, monopoly price lxing
which subverts the few remaining
“natural" economic processes regard-
ed as holy by our leaders. exploitation
oi weaker societies. Many are accus
jug “Big Business“ or centralized corr
porate concerns oi these “crimes.”

On April 17, local communitics will
create a nationwide Big Business Day
with locally' designed teach-ins,
debates, lectures, and iilms which witi
attempt to educate and involve new
people in an undeniably important
issue: the causes of an unproductive,
inequitable force in the World
economy and the multitude 01' alter-
native ideas that are within reach,

_Concern about truly giant corpora-
tions holding control over food,
energy. the workplace, the environ
ment, and government is great. Many
oppose the private ownership oi such
large amounts oi capital with the
private decision-making power over
its allocation in society. Yet such op-
position is too often clothed in
generalizations about corporations,
multi-nationals, and profit-makingiand
not based enough on iacts and truths.
Big Business Day will concentrate on
presenting facts in order to enlighten
and stimulate people. ‘

Sponsors oi the coalition include erst

while antircorporate activists like
Ralph Nader (who plugged the Day on
a recent “Saturday Night Live”
Show), John Kenneth Galbraith, Barry
Commoner, the Consumer Federation
of America. a collection ot top union
leaders, Congressmen Ronald
Dellums and John Conyers, plus
Georgia State Senator Julian send
(who will be on campus this weekend
for the Black Martyr’s program). For
you TV fans, evcn Ed Asncr is on the
Boal’tl of Advisers (I always did like
the "Lou Grant” show).

'i he “nuts” who have long pushed
for various boycotts, lawsuits, strikes,
federal laws to bridle corporate crime,
environmental safeguards, and job
saiety standards are now seeing some
of their work succeeding. and the
public is becoming more concerned
with corporate power, The centerpiece
oi the Big Business Day goals is the
“Corporate Democracy Act,” design
ed to retorin the operations oi the
largest, most iniluential corporations
to better serve the public good. Under
the Act. managers and boards of
directors would be required to be
more accountable ior their actions,
with provisions ior independent audits,
Public Policy and Law Compliance
committees. an increase in
shareholder power through voting
reforms and public disclosure of
employment patterns, environmental
matters, job health and safety, foreign
production, tax rates paid, legal and
auditing ices, shareholder ownership,

the public safety, all with a baSIC re-
quirement that companies with assets

employees come under the jurisdiction
oi this Act.

Some of you may see all this as an
outrageous invasion of government in-
to the workings of privatelyrowned

' businesses and you are certainly Corr

rect. The basic ideology, however, is
not antircapimlism; it is an ideology
based on a concern of autocratic
subversion of democracy by self-
interested powers. Radical activists
view the Day coalition as pretty tame,
but with a “better than nothing” at-
titude. All share a basic interest in
change of one kind or another: when
the public for whom these corpora-
tions exist is not a part of the board-
room decision making process, when
social priorities are overtaken by nar-
row interests, and when companies
which perform a necessary or
valuable service to society use their
inﬂuence to achieve ends inconsistent
with the improvement oi the quality oi
life in society, then corporations have
abrogated their right to privately
operate their business in the public
trust and must be publicly directed
toward more socially usciui activities,
The need for such public direction has
become painiully clear, but our
political system is not nearly flexible
enough to overpower the vested in-
terests of big Capital. Reforms must
be pushed hard, even though the op-
position is strong: corporate donations
to probusiness congressional can-
didates in 19711, for instance, totaled
over $20 million and twice that will
probably be spent during this year‘s
campaigns. Total corporate lobbying
costs are currently nearing the $1
billion annual mark. A poweriul push
is under way to repeal or subvcrt
various parts or OSHA (Occupational
Health and Safety Act), pure food
laws, and the Clean Air Act, Anti-trust
laws now in effect have proven inade-
quate or are uneniorced: irom 1975 to
1973 the growth of conglomerates was
three times larger than the unhealthy
