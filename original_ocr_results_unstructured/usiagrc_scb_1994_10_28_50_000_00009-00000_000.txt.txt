XTweek’sPerfon'ningArts

Film begins the November

Performing Ans Program
which will present four ﬁlms that
illustrate the NeorRealist approach
to ﬁlmmaking. The series will in-
cludeTheBicycle ThiefandLaSrmda
from Italy and Marlon Brando’s On
the Waterfront and The Wild One
from the United States,

As expected, filmmaking expe»
rienced a transformation in the late
forties after World War II, especially
in Europe. Nowhere was the stimu-
lus for change stronger titan in Italy.
where the concept of Nee-Realism
was introduced by directors Roberto
Rossellini, Vittorio de Sica, and
Luchino Visconti. This movement
was toinlluence ﬁlmmakers through-
out tlie ﬁfties and sixties and serve as

a forerunner of what has been called
Contemporary Cinema. The tech»
niques associated with the style were
described by screen writer Cesare
Zavattini, who said, “Do away with
professional actors; hunt down your
material in the streetS: focus on hu»
man situations; and concentrate on
the problems of the people“

The Bicycle Thief
Thursday, November 3; 9:15 pim..
Harris Cinema (87 min.)

The ﬁrst in the series, Vittorio de
Sica’s best known ﬁlm The Bicycle
Thiefmade the meaning of Neo-Re-
alism visually clear, and it is said that
this ﬁlm has come the closest titan
any other to deﬁning the term Pro-
duced in 1949, it has won both an
Academy Award and the New York
Film Critic's Award from Best For—
eign Film as well as being voted the
best film ever made in 1952. In
addition, this movie continues to rate

“I’m supporting John
Terprtra because he
believes in progressive
‘a democratic principles
and policies. I hope you
- will supportJohn
Terpstra too.”

high on lists of the world‘s ﬁfty best

The ﬁlm portrays the story of a
poor man. his son and the bicycle that
provides their livelihood Just when
the bicycle is needed foralong-sought
job, it is stolen, and the ﬁlm shows a
desperate search through the streets of
Rome in an effort to recover it. De
Sica’s film represents the elements of
the classic NeoRealistic ﬁlmr Like
the plot, the style is simple, and the
acwrsarenon-professionalswhocome
atom the environment Lhey represent
on the screen. For example,theengag-
ing boy Staiola was a newsboy in real
life. In addition, the planned giainy-
textured images majecwd emphasize
the plight of a victim and his son who
are alone against the world.

According to Mario Gromo‘s
Fifty Years of Italian Cinema. this
ﬁlm “is a sad and human lyric
movingandbeautilulruthehighpoint
of the Italian Cinema.“

Cries and Whispers
Friday and Saturday a! 8:00 (1171.:
Sunday or 2:00 p.m., ARH 302 (91
min.)

Winner of numerous awards in-
cluding the Academy Award for best
cinematography, Sweden‘s 1974
Cries and Whispers takes a stark and
emotional look at the difﬁculties of
communication among humans. Fo-
cusing on three sisters and a simple
peasant maid, the story explores the
themes of marriage, adultery and sul-
fering. According to directorlngmar
Bergman, “What matters most of all
in life is being able to make contact
with another human“ Bergman re-
veals this powerful theme by explor—
ing the tragedy that results form the
characters detachment from one an-
other. The innovative use of color
adds another symbolic dimension to
the film.

of realrlife seven year old chess

little chess prodigy makes “all

as an ordinary boy with an ex-
traordinary gift. Though this
movie, we can get a glimpse of
the burdens as well as the bless-

haven‘t seen this, but several
sources say it’s a good one.

The Shining

This movie has got tobe one
of the scariest ones I've seen
it’s a classic thriller ﬁlled with
scenes that put you ontheedge of
your seat! Jack Nicholson (just
looking at this guy freaks meoul)
plays a man who, along with his
dopey wife and ESPrenabled
child Danny, house-sits a large
resort in the mountains while it‘s
closed to guests for the winterr
The family is very isolated from
the rest of society, and Jack’s
sanity goes out the window As
an added bonus in the scariness
factor, we get continual remind-
ers that the last family who spent
the winter here didn’t have such
a great time eitherr
