'eason’s Football

Marked Improvement, Good F uturei

“Wait till next year!" is the cry of the Grinnell football fan
who likes to dope things out on paper. When you compare
osscs against one victory and seven
can see how successful Hank Browns
first year of coaching has been and how well the team responded.
And prospects are bright for an even better record next year.

year’s five wins and three 1
feats of the 1948 Season you

The ten senioi-s that finished
out the year for the Pioneers‘
will not be easy to replacel
End Mei white. tackles Billl
Foege and George Gregg, and‘
Guards Charlie Ward, Ras Nor—
vet, and Ad Jones are the grad-
uating linemen. Gone from the
backfield will be Jack Thellman.
Del Eggers, Steve Hitchcock ,and
John Bonyata.

“Whether we will use a pla-
tccn system next year depends
on this year's reserves and on
our new men from the freshmen
Squad,” Coach Brown stated.
"We will need improvement on‘
the part of some of the reserves
to have the depth needed to playl
two teams."

But barring the im onderr
ables such as transfers, i iuries,
and ineligibility, Brown will
have a strong nucleus returning
from this year's squad.

Running down the line; the
end posts should be well n‘lanr
ned with five returning vetel'r
ans, Chet Lacy, Don Young, Don
Johnson, Paul Jones, and Lee
Christensen ready to go next
year. Although losing a pair of
good tackles, Brown will have
Dave Dunlop, Bob Bigeiow, Alan
Goldfarb, Joe Yeck and Ed
Rowse to stop those line plunge

es in l950. .

As he lost three guards
through graduation, Brown will
be watching spring practice care~i
fully, looking for capable re.
placements. Harold Gregg and
Dave Theophilus may well be
the best pair of guards in the
conference next year, and the
problem of reserve strength may
be solved by John Reuben and

Jim Morgan.

At the center position Grin-
nell has Ed Aduddell, under-
studied this year by Ray Stan»
derwick and Rod Barr. Paul
Phillips, who played defensive
halfback this season, is also an
experienced center.

You can’t take men as fast as
John Bonyata and Steve Hitch—
Cock or defense men like Del
Eggers and Jack Thellman out
at the backfield without losing
something, but the Pioneers
still have a crop of experienced
men to take over.

At quarterback, John Rei-
niers, Gene Parker, and Bernie
Oakes will be back, but Brown
would like to find another pass~
ers for the T»ioi‘lnation, Chuck
Biermann. injured most of this
year, Duane Blough. and Bill
Johnson, are the returning full-
backs.

To fill the hallliack posts are
Clark Kingery, Rudy Miller,
Don Slocum, Paul Phillips, Bob
Pederson, and Bill Reece.

From the point of view of re»
turning players, Grinncll is more
fortunate than some of the other
schools in the Conference. Carle-
ton, and Lawrence, this year’s
conference champs, will be 105—
ing many oI their veterans.
“They will still be tough to
beat, however," Brown Warned.

Brown expressed his satisfac-
tion with the team spirit and
with the play in every game eXr
cept‘the last one against Ripon
where both teams played sloppy
football. A victory over Ripon
would have given the Pioneers
third place in the league, but
the loss dropped Gl‘innell to
sixth place. But just wait till
next year when~well, just wait,
