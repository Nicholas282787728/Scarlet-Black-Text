Track Team Trainer.

The litaltngemcnt of the track
team have ctlgaged Mr ],P.\/V:it-
son or Brooklyn, N. Y., as trainer
tor the coming soasorr. Mr. Wat-
son will start {or Grinncll at once
and will remain with tho team un-
til the Chicago mcct. It will be
noticed that Mr. Watson is par-
ticularly strong in the events in
which our teams have of late been
weak and he may be expected to
develop some men to balance the
team as a whole. Mr. Watson is
not only a good athlete himself
but he has a thorough knowledge
of all the athletic sports and will
undoubtedly be of great service
to our team, A large number of
the track uteri will stay here dur-
ing vacation and it rs to be hoped
that all who possibly can will re
main and take advantage of the
opportunity ot working under a
competent trainer.

We give below a letter of VVal~
ter Christie to the management
concerning Mr, Watson:

“This introduces Mr. j. P. Wat-
son. one of the best all around
professional athletes in the world
Lo-day. Have seen Mr. Watson
compete at most of the Caledon-
ian clubs in various cities and have
always seen him win rnost ot the

prizes. In fact he is always the

highest winner. Hav: known him
for ﬁve years, competed against
him every ycal, been thrown in
contact with him and always found
him honest and agreeable and Al
ways a man.

At his events he is perhaps
without a peer, he is a wonderful
jumper, with or without weights,
high, broad, standing and all
styles of jumps. His records
speak tor themselves, over 22 [set
professional style,
board,ovcr49 feet in hoprstepr
and-jump. Ho is a good hurdler
and asplcndicl pole varrlter. lie
is very fast for 50 yards and was
the only man in the east nlm
could make me extend myself in
that event the past summer. I

was open for the world at the
trmc.

He knows athletics. has comr
petetlJn Canada. Amerlca and
England. He knows the knocks
and different tricks, has sound
common sense vrervs on atlllt: cs.
Has a good education and would
make a competent teacher olathr
lotics for any college. Feel safe
in recommending him.

Very Resp'y
