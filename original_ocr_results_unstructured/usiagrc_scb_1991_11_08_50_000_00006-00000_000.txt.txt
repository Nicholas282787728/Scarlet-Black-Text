A time for open minds

Last week, the President's Coalition fora StrongerMultj-Ethnic Presence
returned to Grinnell to analyze multiculturalism on campus. Although both
the committee and the college believe there is still work to be done, they
acknowledge the progress thus far toward an enhanced. diverse environ-
ment. Through an expansion of currentef forts towards student retention and
an emphasis on increasing the number of new students of color, the college
will be making two major steps on the path to diversity. Moreover, many
students. faculty and administrators believe that the definition of
multigulturalism should be broadened to include all students of color. In
other words, the focus ofmulticulturalism should move beyond a concentra-
tion on African American issues.

Also last week. a symbol of race-hatred appeared on the door of at least

one Jewish student. The act cannot

defense because it is an act which is
meant not only to strike tenor and
fear in an individual, but in an entire
community, as the Anti—Defamer
tion League representative Robert
Wolfson argued.

These two contradictory events show that Grinnell has not progressed as
far as hoped in creating not only a more multicultural environment but,
equally imponantly, an environment that is accepting of diversity, A
multicultural campus means more than quotas or non-Euro—centric classes;
it means an understanding, even an acknowledgement that races and
culturesother than the dominantones exist and are justaswonhy of study and
praise. An article in this week‘s issue included a quote from a student who
noted the tendency to conceptualize multic ilturalism as a limited focus on
African American issues and a negiligence of other peoples of color. There
is deﬁnitely a need for this greater appreciation, as recommended by the
Multi-Ethnic Coalition and as evidenced in the threatening behavior toward
a Jewish student.

The Scarlet aridBlack agrees with those who demand greater diversity on
whatispredominately awhite campus; there is, then, aneed to appreciate not
only the African American contribution to society but the presence and
contributions of other peoples as well. This need can be satisfied through
support services, classes and admissions policies, but advancement cannot
be made until the people whocomprise the current environment facilitate the
process of acceptance and appreciation

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Students criticize behavior
at Women Take Back the Night

To the editor,

We are writing to express our an~
ger with what happened during the
speak out which concluded Women
Take Back The Night. The speak out
is always a very intense experience,
but also an empowering one. We usu-
ally leave saddened but also relieved
forhztving found asafespacc in which
to tell our stories. For survivors of
any type of abuse, the issue of safe
space is an extremely important one.
Safety implies protection, especially
protection from abusers.

This Sunday, that safe space was
violated. Certain members of the
group chose to share their experir
enccs as abusers. It was obvious to all
present that their stories were painful
and that they understood the full ex-
tent of their past actions. It was obvi-
ous that they were “men trying to
change.“ However, it was also evi-
dent that their confessions violated
the scnse of safety within the group.
Their timing couldn't have been
worse.

Many women later expressed dis-
gust at what had been said and a
desire to leave.’l’he issues broughtup
by the abusers, (ex-abusers?), are
important and need to be dealt with.
BUT doing so at that time was com-
pletely inappropriate. Their testimo-
nies did not belong in that fomm.
Women Take Back The Night is one
night a year which focuses on the
empowerment of women, particularly
victims and survivors of abuse. We
canNOT channel the energy created
by that empowerment into sympathy
or pity for abusers who would, once
again, strip us of our power as whole

persons with integrity who deserve to
be respected as such and NOT as
pools of nurtumnee. The very fact
that they spoke demonstrates their
inability to respect other people’s
safety. The rapist mentality which
spawned their past abusive behavior
was again demonstrated in this exhi-
bition of ultimate insensitivity.

What were you thinking? What
could you possibly expect?

Kent defends self, work

To the editor,

There seem to be a number of
misconceptions circulating around the
campusrcgardingtheSpectatorandl
would like to take this opportunity to
clear a few things up.

First off, the Spectator is not MY
newspaper, and its writers are not my
“loathsome little group of reporters."
I contribute to the Spectatar on a
regularbasis.butthepaperis no more
mine than the Scarlet arid Black was
mine when I wrote for ita few years
ago. Mike Washbum has editorial
control over the paper, as its editor in
chief. Hc has,in fact,dcclined toprint
several cartoons I have submitted. I
am very proud to be affiliated with
the publication, but it is inaccurate to
refer to it as “Mike Kent‘s paper.“

Second,thc obscrvationregarding
Professor Mootry is not libel, it is not
racist; it was the statement of a verir
fiable fact presented in editorial con-
text. I do not know of any other pro»
fessors who regularly uscprofantly in

their classes, so the “singling out"
racism charge is groundless. The fact
that the observation was true protects
it from libel charges. The paper can
say anything it wants to about any
professor just as long as those items
that arepresented as factare true. The
paper also has the right to subjec-
tively criticize any prof on any
grounds so long as the paper does not
commit libel in the process. That’s
called freedom of the press, and no
governing body in the United States
has the authority to arbitrarily restrict
IL

Lastly. regarding the Spectator as
an “arch-conservauvc” publication.
That designation tsentirely relative. I
think a lot ofGrinnellians are in for a
real Shock when they get out into the
real world and find that the Spectator
is a lot closer to center than they are.
Make hay while the sun shines, guys,
for tomorrow we‘ll be in charge.

EYES WIDE

OPEN

The power of exclusive language

I’m sick and tired of being sick
andtired. MostlyI'mjusttired though.
Igetweary of feeling like I constantly
battle for my right to live like every—
one else. Let's get a basic lesson in
Grinnell Radicalism As It Truly Is.
Why take the word of some right-
wing thing for what the left is really
saying? This is how it is:

Iam notagirl. Don‘tcallmeagirl.
I’m not a chick, babe or any other
adjective born from the quagmire of
testosterone Nor am I a guy. When
you address a group of mixed com-
pany and refer to them as guys you
naturally neuter all females. You may
call me gal or refer to me and my
company as folks, people, or how—
ever you may know us—dykcs,
queers,annoyingtadicalwimmin.Ah,
there’s another juicy one: wimmin.
Just my way of saying, I am notwhar
youthmltlam.larnnotwhoyouwant
me to be. Ha!

lwasonceafreshmanrdykeirom-
hell, but I never referred to my past

Shelly West

status as a freshman, freshwomon, or
fresh (isn’tthat French for “frog"7). I
met someone this summer who was
astounded that I object only to the
term freshman and not to the patriara
chal/hierarchical tennsofsophomore,
junior, and senior. So, lest I be out-
radicalized, I have tried “first-year,
second-, third-. and fourlhrycar stu-
dcnt" on the tip of my tongue. At the
moment it‘s not too comfortable, but
I’m trying to break myself in.

My language, you see, describes
what I perceive my world to be—
including myself. So if you have a
hard time dealing with calling fe-
males “women” and not “girls," then
I would ask you to examine why you
don’t call blacks “Negroes” or some
such derivative. Someone before you
has changedtheirlanguage, ifnotyou
yourself. Perhaps you are conscien-

tious and use the term Latina/o in-
stead of Hispanic, Recently at Penn
there has been a massive movement
to remove Oriental from the vocabu-
lary of the student body. “Rugs are
Oriental." The English language
changes, folks; hop on the clue bus.

Most amazing is the number of
whites that refuse to concede to new
nomenclature of other peoples, the
number of men who insist on calling
their 40-year-old secretaries “girls"
and the number of straight folks who
constantly refer to “homosexuals" (for
those of you unaware. this is clinical
at best, and definitely not a descrip»
tion of a human being). It seems that
persons of the majority believe they
have the authority of Adam: to name
all they see. A goodexample ofthis is
Andy Rooney, who proclaimed one
evcningthathestillcallsRussia“Rus—
sia"#who wants to take the time to
say Soviet Union? What a silly little
girl.
