HIS evening there will be
dedicated the Uncle Sam
Club House, which IS
ment to the enterprise and Cl'tlis
tian character of the people of
Grinnell. Few cities in Iowa have
such a building and yet few need
itless than Grinnell. Slugttlarly
free from the rougher element in
he: population, Grinnell has just
placed almost six thousand dol~
lars ol insurance that her peoplein
the More may be or the best
classes. To insuie the tuture the
boysztnd girls ot today who will
soon he the voters. the fathers
and mothers. are to have still an-
other educalional advantage. still
another stimulus toward the high-
est ambitions. such enterprises
as this aic whutgive a gleam ot
hope inan age that is avowedly
given over to commercialism.
The Uncle Sam Club House is a
a worthy product qt the success
ms of the Ion-a Band and other
noble pioneers of the state. whose
sell sacriﬁce {blinded Grtnuell and
lowa College and whose spirit
still lives ill town and cohege,

arc inltcrcnt evils In
the system of selecting
basket bail officials from mem-
bers of oppasmq teams. It may
be that the game (lacs not pay
enough to afford ﬁrst class itn-
partial emcials. but men who are

quite unconsciously and un-
intentionally. pcrhaps. will watch
tor touts by opposing playels.
rather than by their own men.
Every effort ought to be made.
when sucha thing is possible, to
secure unbiased ofﬁcials. This
would make the game much more
satisfactory to all concerned. for
players and spectators dislike to
seea game decided by ofﬁcials
