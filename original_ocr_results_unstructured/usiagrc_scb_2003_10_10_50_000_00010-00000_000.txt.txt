announced that the popular hip-hop group Atmosphere
would not he performing at Crinneil today. This came as
a surprise to students hecaese the show had been listed on
the Concerts Committee's web site and on the College
Calendar.

Aeeording ro Concerts Committee Chair John
Chavez, “During the summer when I set this show up i
thought we had conﬁrmcd the show and the agency was
sending over a contract," adding, “A oontraet was never
sent.

The normal process for booking a hand begins with
contacting the band's booking agent or agency “we say
that we would like to have the hand play a show at
Griiiiicll and explain that it will he a free show open to
the public." said Chavez A price is then negotiated for
the show. “That price is usually the amount that the hand
is uid make irthey sold oitt a venue orsimilar sire at a

' cred show," said Chavez, “Afit-r we have negotiated a
fa price for the show they send over a contract. "

Chavez then explained that he thought this process
had been completed successfully He said, “The show
appeared in national concert listings, on the agencies web

agency that handies booking tor/atmospheres perfor-
mances When asked about the show bernhardt said, “it
was never booked or conﬁrmed." He tvent on to say,
“Negotiations [to have Atiiiosplictc perform at Crinneili
pretty much ended by trying to nail down a date."

Howcvcr. Chavez insisted that the show had been
conﬁrmed saying, “The tour manager contacted me for
an address to send promotional materials."

Chavez contiictcd the booking agency on Sept. 19
when he noticed he had yet to receive a contract from the
Kork Agency. He said that he was then told by the agency
that Atmosphere would not be coming to perform at
crinneli because the show had not been conriintcd and
the band wanted the day oh to rest.

Chavez said that it didn't make anysense tor the hand
to want the day orrto rest because, “The Crinneli show
was the last day orrhe tour, and they would have two
weeks orrahei the show."

Concerts Committee has scheduled another hipthop
show reaturing the Usual Suspectz from Chicago to
perform in place ofAtntosphere The show will take place
tonight at 10 in Gardiner Lounge,

Enon was founded by John schemersal after the breakup ofBrainiac
du: to the death of thcir front min. After living in an ahandoncd
Masonic temple in Kentucky where he recorded his solo album Forget
amt/ring schemersai moved to New York City, where Enon was born.
He recruited Rick Lee and Steve Cahoon from Skeleton Key to the trio.
The band's multifaceted, perplexing approach to music began with their
name and hasn't stopped since. The hand is probably named after a town
in Schcmcrsal's horn: state, Ohio, but it could also bc dcrivcd fmm the
microwave company Enon, or a resort in Alabama, or a character in
Macbeth or simply “none“ spelled backwards. The meaning is in the ear
of the listener,

Enon’s ﬁrst album Below is a fantastic postmodern popt
dcconsttuctionist concoction. Layers of noise, distortion, Falsctto and
synthetically inodihed vocals give the under-lying pop melodies- and
rhythms an identity all their own. The errect is run, funky and marginally
disturbing in a curtotmc usic sort orway. This ‘iini etnetiy Surpllslng,
givcn that Schcmctsal c ,d the [hunt songs for noon Ncnvork's
Iirinrrnri Sp/rrnnd Curb” They don't bring in armpit-s so much at they
play with noisecieating an entirely new sound rather than drawing oil
the listeners inteipietation otreterences. rite music that sprang horn the
minds of Enon is uiiclitssifiablc.

Since their ﬁrst album, Enon has lost Rick Lee, who ctcatc-d most of
the computerized distortion for the band. Their second two albums, High

see/cry and Hone Porto, arc much less cxpcrimcntal, but they haven't lost
their twrsted edge. The band has also added member Yoko yasuda,
formerly ofBlonde Redhead. Enon now produces more straighteup indie
rock, but it is still some dam good start. The tunes and beats are my to
get carried away by, and Yasuda's melodic, slightlyeaceented voice adds a
whole new dimension to the vocal component, it is not music you would
sing along to so much e bounce with, The band puts rorth a playful
performance in concert as well, They’ve been known to start "rappmg”
with sounds mther than words, and doing The Robot onstage. They‘ll
begin touring Europe next month.

The opening acts will he ItWas Just Forroii, That Light Show and
Comsomoi Diaries. Light show is a band out orthe nvin cities area,

(bass, keyhoaid, vocals). The band, named by Invic. earned second place
For best Band Name in Best orthe Twin Cities, The group began while
the members were still in high school and got its first bicnh in a iadio
contest called Battle ofthe Undeiage Underground. 'l‘hev stick mainly to
