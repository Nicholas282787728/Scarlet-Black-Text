Physicist Discusses Crinnell

As Foundati

Last fall the Scarlet and Black put
this question to a nmuber of Crinnell
alunmi who havc been notably suc-
'tessflll is proiessional and business
ines: “Do you believe that a liberal
irts education. particularly the Grin-
nellbrand. pays inyour proiessioni"
The alumni were allowed to put their
own interpretation on the word “pays.“
_ On April 9 a letter irom D. E.
Brundage, successiul advertising man
of London, England, was published,
discussing the value oi liberal arts
from the standpoint of the advertising
business. The following letter, the

. second to be printed, was written by
Samuel Robinson Williams. l01, pro-
fessol' of physics at Oberlin college.

Mr. Williams obtained the degree oi
Pll. B. from Grinnell in 1901, M'. A.
from University oi Nebraska, and at-
ter spending two years in research
and study in the University of Berlin.
was granted a Ph. D. from Columbia
university in 1906. Since 1903 he has
been connected with oberlin college
and has gained wider and wider rec-
ognilion in his field.

Does a liberal arts course in Crin-
nell college payi My profession is tllii‘
of a physicist and after twenty-two
years since graduation from Crinncll
College, which specializes in liberal
arts, .1 come back to answer most
emphatically, it does nny‘.

(I) it 1m.) in dollars and cents ii
the monetar - side oi the question must
be argued. Too many young people
in our high schools can’t see how it
pays to put five hundred to one ‘rhous-
and dollars a year into a college edu-
cation when they might be .out earn-
ing that much or more per year during
the four years of a college course.
They forget that with a college train-
ing they would, in general, be getting
more than with just a high school
education. There is always the urge
to get into some vocation where the
individual will be earning something
with a minimum of expense in pre-

paration. our "feverish ways‘" lead
-to get-rieh-duiclr methods, shortcuts
to education and preparation for life's
work.
Liberal Allis for Enguleers

To illustrate: there are so-called
schools of electrical enginee ng which
promise to turn out electrical en-
gineers in six months or so. The
students who attend are furnished
dynamos and motors and are taught
to start and stop them. They are
taught to wind dynamos and motors.
To many this is ”practical" work be-
cause it is giving the technique of
a job as an electrician. There is no
criticism of this type of training if
one wants it. but it is not the kind
at training which the majority oi our
reading engineers have had, nor does
it bring the larger salai . The ideal
training for an engineer s a tour year
course in a liberal arts college with
some wise selection of courses bear-
ing on the field or engineering which

‘is to he pursued intensively after
‘graduation in a iirst class school of
engineering leading to an engineer's
degree. It need hardly be mentioned
that mathematics. physics and chem-
~ are fundamental to the various
fields or engineering,

Some years ago the 12th) maximal“
at one oi the leading engine ing so-
cielies of America were asked what
they thought oi a liberal arts course
as a preparation for engineering. To
the surprise oi some ' was almost a
unanimous verdict that a liberal arts
education was the best sort of a
foundation for engineering. An cn-
sineor to be at the top or his pro-
fesslon must be an angio r
as well as oi materials.

liar-claps Qualities oi Leadership

There can he no question but what
a liberal arts course in its 'hrozlllcm-
ing outlook is hclpiul in producing.
leadership. The statistics of leader-
ship in the various walks in liic‘hear
out this statement. To sum up this
argument: each year added to une's
preparation, makes for mom outstand-
inc leadership in life's work. and in

general that means better salaries.
Any investment oi tune, money and
eilort for improvement is a good ii-
nancial investmcut. The years spent
in a liberal arts college are founda-
tion'al to any career.

(2) However, success is not measur-
led entirely by salary or position. A lib-
eral arts course pays for the broader
outlook on life no matter what the
profession. The classmates I am
proudest of are those who, their sheep-
skins having been secured. went back)
to the tarin, but not to the “dull round
'of years." with clear‘ minds and
hearts thcy looked out on a world
which had been enlarged and enrich-
ed by their are spent in college
halls It s only as we see life in its
enti ety and our work in relation to
it that we do our most efiicicnt la
bor. ‘

A young iriend of mine graduat-
ed iroin a well known eastern insti-
tution and out oi the 120 hours for
the bachelor's degree 90 were devoted
to one subject. Fortunately, such a
calmnity could not happen to a stu-
dent in Crinnell College. She he-
lievcs that if one ‘wls’hes to be a
chemist he will be a better chemist
it he sees something oi the relation
lot chemistry to economics. to history.
to political science, art, etc. As one
sees the powers of the world grabbing
after the coal and oil tields and the
iron mines, can anyone doubt that a

Givt‘s Broader Outlook 1

To sum up this second argument;
we do ,our most efficient work
when we are happy doing it; and this
is secured when we have a whole-
world-mindedness that gives oppor-
tunity for the intellect to live in more
than just one little narrow groore we
call our protession. A liberal arts
i‘mlrsl' fosters the broad outlook on
life.

(:i) The mere acquisition oi a lib-
eral arts education is not a sine qua
nor. to success. It may make a res-
cal a bigger one. with the, training
of mind and body must also go the
increasing appreciation oi the spirit-
‘ual values of lire. Grinnell has
steadily and persistently stood out for
the all-round development or her stu-
dents. it is only as they catch the
ideals oi senior to others may they
hope for "good Success." A sense
that increased opportunity means a
greater responsibil y to one‘S fellow-
nmn and an intention to do a little
more than what is asked oi one will
make a college graduate invincible.
The, fact that these idealsare held Di:
and fostered in Grinnell college adds
another argument in favor oi Crinnell
when one is selecting a college for
further education and development.
