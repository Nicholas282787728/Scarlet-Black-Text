Perspective on Returning

- by Alan Jones

Professor of History and American Studies
That Grinnell, especially Grinnell in the
spring, has changed in the last few years is
obvious to anyone familiar withthe College.
One does not need the perspective afforded
by a sabbatical year’s absence to see these
changes, but the return from a leave in
England in the pastoral environs of Cam»
bridge University reinforces certain im-
pressions oi the nature of the change.
Between 1966 and 1972, spring in Grinnell
was a season anticipated with foreboding
by administrators who over this period
developed a certain style of "crisis man—
agement," Grinnell was not unique in its
crises, although there were local variaa
tion: on the national phenomena - the cen-
tral campus turned into a vast graveysrl
one beautiful morning to herald the visit
of a Marine recruiter. the upside - down ~
international . distress . signal nag inci-
dent, the three day moratorium alter the
assinaﬁon of Martin Luther King to dis-
cuss the Report of the National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorder, the apoc-
alyptic days after Kent State and the early
closing of the College, and the week long
candlelight marches in the town after the
mining oi Haiphong in the spring 011372.

Academic continuities were challenged by
the intervention or national political evean
and local political sensibilities. With rea-
son, some administrators, faculty, and
students then feared the politicalization
of the College and now look back with anger
at the experience, graterul that it is over
and that the College has returned to qui-
eter springs and to narrower academic
endeavors

I confess acertain nostalgiafor the springs
of the recent past and am not all that
sanguine about the present. Between 1165
and 1972 the challenge of a national poll»
tical crisis was a clear and present real-
ity. Given the traditions of the College‘s
positive response to this challenge was to
be anticipated, and i find little to regret
about. the general nature (and the civility)
of the response that was made.

The College is an ambiguous institution,
both in the world and detached from the
world, looking outward to the larger suc-
iety and inward to itself. The problem of
maintaining a balance between its outward
and inward preoccupations is a complex
one, raising important issues or the re-

‘Grinnell College and 'Crilical

by David Wernecke

Before the platitudes and sticky senil-
mentality for olde Grinnell become inex-
tricably fixed in our minds, we should
carefully reﬂect upon the ideals Grinnell
College as an educational institution meets.
After much thought during the semester
about educational theory I became satisfied
that "education for critical consciousness"
was the ideal that institutions and espec-
ially educational institutions should serve,

‘ By “critical consciousness" I mean the
inseperable association of analytical met-
beds of examing an ideal or problem, cri-
tical judgement of self. ideas, and the so-
cial milieu, and thoughtful action.

The purpose of educational institutions
should be to aid in achieving this critical
consciousness, and in developing the ski-
lls, attitudes, and inclination to strive
continuously towards intellectual and em-
otional freedom from the constraints of
the social milieu and its supporting myths
and ideas, asWell as self—created cons-

lationship of thought and action, lulowledge
and power, consciousness and society. At
times, the balance is overthrown - a too
radical outward looking takes the insti-
'tution into power and society, into acti-
vist and ”relevant" involvement at the
expense ofthought and contemplation.$ome.
thing of this happened in the recent past
and something of the reverse is happening
now.

is that it is turning inward rather rapidly;
caught up in self—examination, it has been]
more preoccupied with the question of its
own governance than with the governance
of America, more preoccupied with evalu—
ation of itself and its members than with
the evaluation of the world. These are
valid preoccupations.

But inward—turning can he resigned with-
drawal; it can he 3 cynical and frivolous
escape. And this can happen easily when
a pastoral and provincial place isolates
itself even further from the world.

This year i have sensed moods of resig-
nation, cynicism, and frivolity, moods that
have accompanied a drifting quest for a
sense of direction both in the College as ‘
a whole and :t'nong many of its individual
members, amongfaculty and administrators
anxious about their careers and the Col.
lege‘s future, among students discontented
with themselves and their local situation,
looking for alternatives in “oft-campus‘
study” and preaprofessional training. But
compatredio the late 60‘s, everyone’ssense ,
of alternatives is much diminished. The
most ambitious and interesting educational
Experiment has been a modest return to
something like the old Humanities-Histor-
ical Studies requirement of the late liSU's.

Perhaps this is the only meaningful a1-
ternativc, a return to the traditions of
liberal learning, to the aim or creating
"educated pcridlls” in n four year respite
from the cares of the world. Whether
this is‘ a viable alternative or even.a
satisfactory one, given the nature of the
present cares of the world, is open to
question. Tllc perspective from Bigland
and Cambridge otters no clear vision.
Cambridge is an ancient place with proud
traditions of liberal learning; it has long
been aproi'inical and inward-loollingplace,
detached from the cares of the world,
pleasant in the spring when students Dlau’
Croquet on the banks of the Cam. It is
not only the similarity between croquet
playing on central campus and croquet
playing on the banks of the Com that leads
me to note resemblances between Grinnell
and Cambridge. Cambridge has pubs; we
have a "pub"; Cambridge has "boat races"
and June Week; we have the Grinnell
Relays; Cambridge has daffodils; we have
flowering crabs.

There are not many other similiarities,
but my feeling last spring that Cambridge
was rather cynically, ’rivolously, and en—
joyably isolated from the “condition of
England" question is not unlike my present
feeling that Gn‘nnell rlns certain dangers
in its inward—turning phase.

There is a "condi on of America“ ques-
tion, a continuing national crisis. I‘m not
sure how the graduates of the class or U74
or of ensuing classes will respond to it.
I hope they will retain something of the
outward looking style, the tradition, of the
recent past, of the classes of ’68 or ’70
or ’72.

traints.

The extent to which education at Grin-
nell College approaches this ideal is ill-
uslrated by this statement in ”The Objec-
tives of the College" in the Grinhell Col-
lege Bulletin Catalog 1973-74: "Here also
is a deep concern for exact habits of in-
vestigation, for coherent communication,
for intellectual integrity, and for a clear
understanding of the relationship between
thought and decision, between action and'

, consequence."

For all of the deficiences we, as students,
find and continuously grumble about at Gr-
innell we have to admit that a “Grinnell
education” is successful in helping us de-
velop more “exact habits of investigation.”
Although methodological perfection is ne-
ver achieved, we leave Grinnell with much
advanced critical reading, writing, and
thinking abilities than when we entered,
With these increased abilities we are more
capable of coherent and thoughtful com—
munication.

But, fortunately, intellectual and personal
communication at Grinhell is at a mini~

1205 Park Street

by Rob Rama r

Out in the cornfields,
The seeds were stirring.
Human faces opened
Like careful flowers
Uncertain of spring.

Behind the library,

Little boys gatheled acorns
For the women who’s hands
Pressed the seeds

Into the moist earth

The yeilow sun broke away
From a thundercloud,

lt ﬂashed on scattered pools,
And warmed the ground

As a train rolled in.

A man in a gown stood
0n the concrete roof.

He called the names of the women
And the names of the merit

He gave them rectangle cards
And a hand Shake.

He wished them well as a yellow
Crane picked them up

And placed them one by one

in railway express boxes,

“For T ransshipment Only.”

Men were to go;

Tc cubicles

In the Ford Building, Detroit,

To containers

mum. Seldom do intellectual discussions
or any but the most superficial and str-
ained discussions take place in or out of the
classroom. Open dialogue is crucial for
critical consciousness and for more th-
oughtful and human relationships, butGr-
inell can be characterized by (very often
personally destructive) introspection and
silence. "Intellectual integrity” is too
easiiy achieved by individuals when con-
cepts are not challenged through discus-
slon.

Notwithstanding, the final phrase of the
catalog‘s statement is the crux of Grin-
nell College’s problems. Whey is “thou-
ght and decision" separated from "ac—
tion and consequence?" We are constantly
engaged in intellectual exercises with lit-
tle expression in or modification through
action, or What I would call “reflective
~application.” Although many opportunities
are available to us for “reflective appli-
cation“ in the Grinnell community, the st-
ructure of life at the college deters these.
Little encouragement is formally adver-
tised (Le. credited courses) for “reflec-
tive-application” in the community. Aside
from art, theatre. music, and leaching,

Women were to go;

TD classrooms

In South Dakota,

Tu little boxes

On a southern California hillside,
And a few exceptional ones

Were packed off to vaults

in the Chase Manhattan.

Wide-eyed children stared in amazement
At the sight of their friends

Being sorted and packaged,

Frozen and dried,

Like so many vegetables.

AS the first breath of drought
Dessicated the gardens

And the sun settled

Into a thick cloud of dust,

The hoxcars jerked to a start.

But deep in each of glass packing crates
The seeds were sprouting.

They struggled to emerge

into a crimson spring,

A Spring which will come

As soon as the engineer shuts down,

The crane operator abandons his machine,
And they are led by the women

To stand firmly alongside the children.

the majority of credited activities at Grin-
nell strive for intellectual development
through haplessly the limited actions of
paper-writing, The possibility of mean-
ingful activity in evelyday life is very
limited at Grinnell as well; consider the
virtual vacuum of student determination
of and input into College government, fac-
ulty hiring, firing, and tenuring, and hous-
ing and food selection and preparation

The lack of necessary coordination of th-
ought and ”reflective application," respon-

it is very difficult for a whole, integratéd
individual to emerge from this milieu.
This is not a very exemplary virtue for
an educational institution whose implicit
(and highly questionable and unfoirunate)
self-concept is the production of our na-
tion’s elites.

While Grinnell College has blessed us
all with its virtues, we haw.- been victims
and perpetrators of its incompleteness.
we can congratulate ourselves for sur~
vlvlng, if we did.
