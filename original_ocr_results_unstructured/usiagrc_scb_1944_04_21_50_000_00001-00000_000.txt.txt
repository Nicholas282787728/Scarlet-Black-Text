Crews and Barlow Hold
Decisive Radio Experimenl‘

Have you ever said that you can study just as well with
the radio onithat music doesn’t “bother" you ‘2

Two senior members of the
advanced experimental psycholr
ogy class, Anne Crews and Joan
Barlow, have completed a study
intended to determine just how
much the radio does decrease
study efficiency. This work has
been accomplished under the die
rection of Mack "[1. Henderson,
head of the psychology depart:
merit. and was presented by the
group at the annual session of
the Iowa Academy of Science
in Cedar Rapids last Saturday,

The study involved the effects
of two types of music distrac-
tion, classical and popular, upon
the reading fficicncy of fifty
freshmen wo n, all of whom
had previously filled out a ques
tionnaire indicating whether or

\not they were accustomed to
studying with the radio on and
to what type of program they
usually listened, These women
were divided into_three sections,
one of which was tested with
Casar Franck’s “Symphony in D
Minor" as background, one with
“jive" and “boogy” offering dis-
traction, and the third, a control
group, without music.

The results of the experiment
showed conclusively that popular-
music is a great deal more dis-
tracting than classical music,
especially on related subject mar
torial requlrlng reasoning, and
that even though one is news
tomed to studying with the radio
on. it continues to decrease his
efficiency considerably.

Honor Sys’reml
To Apply Only
In Final Exams

Hope to Use Trial Plan
During Spring Finals to
Ascerfain Weaknesses

The proposed honor system, tc
be put into effect next fall for
the school year 194445, will ap-
ply only to final examinations
Gerry Ross, student council pres-
ident, announced

Though a definite outline of
the system will not be completed
until next week, the proposed
plan includes a pledge of affir~
motion to be taken by all stu-
dents at the beginning of the
year. The pledge will state that
the sighator understands and will
comply wrth the system as set
forth by the student council and
approved by the faculty and ad-
ministration.

Provision may be made for
each student to sign a pledge at
the time of an examination cone
firming that he did or did nol
give or receive information dur-
ing the test. No proctors, fac-
ulty or student, will remain in
the room more than a few min-
utes before and after the exam
ination. This time will be allow-
ed for the purpose of answering
questions.

in the instance that a person
need be penalized for giving or
receiving information, his case
will be reported to the student
council and recommended to the
faculty for final judgment. The
penalty to be inﬂicted is not do
cided as yet.

It is hoped that a workable
plan will be ready in time for
final examinations ‘ths spring
Miss Ross said. The trial sys-
tem will be used at that time to
detect weaknesses which will be
corrected for next year’s use.

“There have been cases where
the honor system has not provet’
a feasible one. We hope that the
students will cooperate in every
way to make the Grinnell honor
system a success," Miss Ross
stated.
