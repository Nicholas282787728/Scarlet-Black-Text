Track Teams Fare Well at State Meet: Confident
.About Conference Chances at Cornell

 

By Gerald Honigstock

Nothing is certain in the
arena of Track and Field, as
there are so many factors which
play a role, yet some of the
performances at the State Meet
last Friday night approached the
unbelievable.

The Grinnell women‘s team
qualiﬁed in both the 4 X 200M
and the 4 X 400M relays, and it
was the latter which most
stupct’ied both the participants
and the spectators. With Kate
Peterson leading off, followed
by Anne Hollislor, Jennifer
Jones, and Amy Reinhart, the
relay team demonstrated its
talent by smashing 15 seconds
off the previous best lime Lhis
season. Jones, admitting that
she had not run a 400M race in
quite some time, improved upon
her personal best in that distance
by six seconds. To drop so
much time is akin to the
Grinnell men’s basketball teams
scoring 100 points in a game.
In the Conference Meet tonight
and tomorrow, both relays will
be gunning for the school
record.

Speaking of which-another
record did fall. Again it was
Jonathan Lave. Lavc ran a

1500M in which he'snrgcd‘ca‘rlY"

and dusted the pack to ﬁnish in
a near National qualifying time
of 3:56, an improvement of
three seconds over his efforts
two weeks previously.

Not to be overshadowed,
David Hammond showed a fine
understanding of race tactics by
placing fourth with a personal
best of 4:03. He then went on
to run the 5K. unleashing a
devastating kick in the last
200M to assure himself of lst
place! The third Grinnell mnner

 

in the 1500M, Guy Potter, also
ran well (4:07).

In the 1000M. Chris
Garman and Todd Rowekamp
demonstrated their speed to place
third and seventh respectively.

The meet also gave the pole
vaulters a chance to show off
their prowess. Both Darren
Robertson and Lee Kracmer put
forth fine efforts, with Kraemer
vaulting '13’6" and Robertson
catapulting himselfovcr l3’.

In the long jump, Mark St.
Andre and Matt Schrager used
the meet as one last test before
Conference. Meanwhile, Kevin

Tapp used the technology of the
video camera to fix his form in
the triple jump, and jumped
39’8". improving his personal
best by five inches.

The men placed fourth of 20
teams. In doing so, they
doubled the point totals of
Conference foes Coc and
Cornell, a feat they would very
much like to repeat at
Conference.

With both squads being well
rested. self-confident and
anxious to prove their mettle,
the Conference Meet should

prove to be an exciting one.

team. After an easy 15-5
victory.in the first game, the
team had to fight hard in the
second for a l7715 come from
behind victory.‘

In the playoffs, Grinnell lost
two games to the eventual
tournament winner C.R.
Trunks 15—12, 15-10.

Team members felt this was
their best performance of the
year despite ﬁnishing third for
the third tournament in a row.
The team seemed to pull
together in clutch situations,

and could count on everyone on
the court to contribute towards
the total effort. Especially
notable performances were
turned in by Nathan Timm, Joel
Shepherd, and Grey Gardner who
turned in his best day so far as a
Grinnell setter. Also of note
was Nut Ward‘s play for the
Drake University team, which
was Short handed due to Injury.

“Hey, we did better than
Grinnell did, what more could I
ask for?“ said Ward about
Drake’s second place finish in
the other pool.
