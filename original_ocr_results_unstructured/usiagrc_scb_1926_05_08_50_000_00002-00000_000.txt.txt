NATIONAL S'l'ljlliNT FELLOWSHIP.

Romain Rolland, who may unhesitatingly he called a
realist, ﬁrmly believes that the world is fed with a little
truth and many lies. Every race, every art has its
hypocrisy, and the human mind would seem to be so
feeble that truth in consistent quantities upsets it, and its
religion, morality, states, poets, artists, must be presented
to it carefully swathed in what only seems to be the truth.
This may he only half the case, but the human mind has
a peculiar and unlovely facility of adapting these lies to
the mind of each race, and it is these nationally inter
preted errors that make it so hard for nations to tinder-
stand each other, and so easy for them to despise each
other.

Truth is intrinsically universal, the same for all

idealism, and which has become a condition of life.

The most worthwhile thing we can do to carry our
vision beyond the narrow conﬁnes of our own small lives
is to at least consider these national conflicting idealisrn‘s
in the light of the Student Fellowship Move-
ment, as it was revealed to some of us one day this last
week. It is nothing less than heroism tor a per-son
to break the wall of personal spites and prejudices but

it is inevitable if happiness is to he pursued. Just so, a

few people of genius must be found who can lead the
rest of the world through heroic moments of crisis, away
from false idealisrns and national arrogance, if there is
such it thing.

lDr. Knight Speaks at
5 Christian Endeavor

l
l Dr. G. Herbert Knight spoke to the
College department of the Christian
Endeavor some time ago on the
topic, “Church organs and choirs,"
ﬁrst, be briefly sketched his life as a.
musician in telling of his early cliildr
hood in England up to his present
170 ' on. Dr. Knight was reared in
the atmosphere of the English church-
es and in early youth, he played on
organs and,had every opportunity to
study the choir.

y In the Church of England, or the
Episcopal church of today, the choirs
are one of the biggest [actors in the
service according to Dl‘. Knight. Chi!»
dren as early as six to ten years of
laser are taken from homes and placed
in schools. They are taught music
iaiong with the regular academy and
‘college work. When these choir boys
\are graduated, they find themselves
‘abie and talented singers. All this
education is free CD Lhem from the
church in return for their services in
the choir, usually devoting their whole
ilife to it.

The position of a singer in the choir
is a Very high and honored one, The
positions are almost on a competitive

Ihasis and only the very best singer-s
'dre retained. As a result, the choir
in the Church of miglanu is the best
part or the service. During the service
the organ player is concealed from
lview in a little tort built high over
the congregation. In this type of
service only the choir sings, and the

 

service is very beautiful.

However, in the churches which
broke away from the established
church, the congregation sings more
than the choir. Even in the non-con»
fol'mists church, the service is much
superior to those we have in America.
according to Dr, Knight. One reason
tor this is because the songs are more,
adapted to congregational singing
than ours, and the other is that the
average Englishman has much more
training in singing in the grade school
than an American.

In conclusion nr. Knight told how
much more beautiful the choir was in
England hecause the members had had
ten years of training, while in Amer-
ica, any one and every one sings, with
the result that we have a great deal
of enthusiasm but not enough nar-
mouy.

Orchestra Recitals
