as to a solution to the problem

footnotes on a financial report.

Among the more prominent
plans offered by students is the
proposal that the daily chapel

ion survey, conducted without any
specific attempt at group reprer

port for this plan.

However, no solid front is pre~
sented by the survey, and the
concensus some to be that “some
thing should be done about it.”

The opinions:

President Stevens: “I am op-
posed to making students go to
chapel. However, I am equally
opposed to 90 per cent of the
student body loafing around for
20 minutes in the middle of the
morning When you stop to think
of it, it is ridiculous to have a 20

“We of the Fourth Estate feel
that the bicycle is here to stay,"

claimed.

the dormitories, and all persons
who think they can mount a

horse or ride a bicycle should

Sigma Delta Chi.

The races are run in conjunc—

Grinnell's different dance, which
will be held the same evening in
the gymnasium.

thirteenth annual dance in which
the more proficient accomplish-
ments of students are honored,
