Despite the financial motivation behind the facelift,
not all orthe bar’s patrons are thrilled about the proposed
changes. “I understand that as the town evolves, they have
to evolve, they have to bourgeoify some,” says l<enyon. “1
just like that right now you only do two things there: play
pool or drink."

Lindsey Walter ’11, who said she currently does not go
to Rabbit's, added that she would be attracted b v the prom-
ise of more and better —

cigarettes than from
gas stations," she said.
“And I'm excited about
that, a variety of good
tobacco products."

For Yaklin, who also said she would like to “attract a
college crowd," the amenities are not just a wise business
decision, but a welcome addition to the bar’s ambience.
Despite the changes, she sought to allay concerns that the
bar's essential atmosphere would shift. “I’m not really go-
ing to change the atmosphere or anything like that. I'm not
going to change the ambience of the bar,just make it more
accommodating," she said.

“In any business, the more you have to offer, the better
offyou are,”Yaklin said. “I like to have fun in a bat Don’t
you like to have fun in a bat?“

Registrar eliminates paper
versron of course schedules

College’s attempt to save both money and trees will still
allow students to receive print schedules upon request

BY MICHAEL SCHOELZ

The Registrar's Ofﬁce is joining the
many companies and organizations that are
making the switch from ptrnt to online.

In an effuit to save money and cut down
on waste, the Registrar's Office will post
the 2009 Fall Semester schcdulc ofcouiscs
tmlllte instead or printing paper copies {or

students can opt in on PtWeb by Maich
10.

According ro Regrsrrat Cheryl Chase,
the main motivation fortlie
primarily unlinc schedule
was to cut the Registrar's
printing expenditures. “If
we quirprinring tlieschedr
ule entirely. meaning that
faculty. nobody got it. we
would save about 59,000 a
year,”said Chase, “Printing
for the students that want
it and the faculty piece of
ir,1'ru hoping I’m saving at
least 85,000."

The movement away from paper print-
ings has been discussed sinec thc beginning
of the year, orteu in terms of the actions of
pecr institutions, “In just working with nry
colleagues at other schools very few schools
are printing a schedule otcoutses anymore,"
Chase said.

Beyond saving on budget spending,
Chase said that the online schedules will
benefit the environment as well. A campus-
wide email announcing the change asked
students to “just say no” in an attempt to
go “green.”

“I’m personally committed to not using
as much ofth: environment that we tend to
use," Chase said.

Chase worked with several student and
faculty groups and found many of them
were very supportive.

tal group, independently approached Chase
with the possibility of not printing the
schedule just as she began working on this
proiect.

But while the Curriculum Committee
was supportive ofthe change, some mcmr
bets had concerns about people who still
want to look through a paper copy.

“It seemed like a common sense comr
promise to say if people really wanted the
printed schedule then they could opt in
to get one," said committee member Dan
Moslsowitz '09.

Charlie Kessnei '12,
who plans to receive a
paper copy of the sched
ule of courses, felt that ii
paper copy is more agrecr
able for organizing par
tential course choices.

“It's mueli more of a
liandsron tool when I’m
trying to ﬁgure out what
courses I'm going to take,"
Kcssncr said. “With the paper copy, I can
say like, I want to take this 200 level Anthro
course and then 1 can highlight that. A lot
of other people might use the digital one
better, but tor rne,1’llkeep the paper copy."

Other students said they feel that an on-
line copy will be more accommodating’than
a paper version.

“I think it’s a little overdue,”said Robert
l<oenig ’11. “I don't know of any other col-
leges that still do things the way Grinnell
did. I transferred here from UerVladlson
and everything was online there and [I]
thought it was much more convenient."

The schedule of course is not the only
administrative publication that has been
targeted for reduction. The Ofﬁce of Ad»
mission said they might cut back on printr
ing the Catalogue of Courses they print for
prospective students,
