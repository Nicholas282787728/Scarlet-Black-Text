At the end of every calendar year
Sport~writers always summarize
What has just gone before in terms
of the greatest performance in foot-
ball, best record in basketball. out
standing tennis player, best all-round
athlete, etc. But every once in awhile,
they overlook a really great athlete,
who for some unfortunate reason or
other failed to achieve the Iecognl~
tion he deserved. ‘

i

, Such is the case of my Mohler, the,
University of Southern California’s
versatile grid star and president of
the student body, Thirty-four times
inidstwoandahalfyeaisonthe
Trojan varsity Mahler has .woven hisl
way to ooucbdowiu against some of

the finest teams in the country. I

In his sophomore year be startled
the Pacific coast by completing 17
touchdown jaunts for his coach, How-
lard Jones. Grantland Rice picked him]
m an alternate all-American back.
But out in the middlewest there was
Frank Cax‘ideo, Notre Dame’s "Lib
tie Napoleon." a senior leading an
undefeated team. Carideo goth the
selection. '

 

s

In-lus junior year Fate played a
double trump on Mahler by forcing
him to share his position with Gains
Shaver, another senior and a mt
footbau player. Experienced critics
looked for a smouldering rivalry, but
they didnit loiow Mohlcr—and the
two bum-no fast frien Vth Shaw
ver was at hulbnck ulnd Mahler at
quarter, orv gave everything he had
to lead the interference for Shaverls
touchdowns. Shaver became heralded

throughout the nation. .

This time it was a tossup between
Shaver and Mohler for the All-Amer-
ican post. Notre Dame players, rec-
ognizing the genius that led the Tro-,
jans in their remarkable come-back,Z
against the Irish turning a 140 de-,
feat into a 16-14 victory, voted him
the greatest player of the year. But
Mohler had another year. and Shaver
got the preference. 5

This season, for the third time,
Mohler was headed for all-American
honors and it now seemed a foregone
conclusion. In the Loyola game, iti-
lor all else had failed, the game little,

while he was running interierence for

physician told him three days later.
So Mohler will never be all—Amer-
