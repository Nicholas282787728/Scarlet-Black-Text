Leonids Meteor shower could be best in decades

In mid»November. Iowa star-
gazers might be rewarded with
one of the most spectacular me-
teor showers to grace the sky in
recent memory.

The “Leonids,” one ofseveral
major meteor showers visible each
year, is expected to reach its peak
on the night ofNovember 17-18.
And if predictions are nccnrare,
the 199‘) shower should reward
viewers with an unusually high
number of meteors. For Iowans,
the best time to look for these
meteors is probably during the
preedawn hours of November
18th.

Although astronomers predict
the best seats for the show should
be in the Far East and Central
Asia, it is expected that observers
around the world should be able
to see quite a display.

“It’s very hard to predict the
detaiis of n-ieteor showers with
any accuracy," said Bob Cadmus,
professor of physics and an ase
tronomer at the Gale Observa»
tory at Gtinnell College. “This is
very likely to be a better show
than usual, but the period ofmost

intense meteor activity may be
brief. The bottom line is that it
could be a good show ifyou hap-
pen to be looking at the right time
and from the right place on the
Earth."

Each year, the Earth passes

though the debris trail of the
comet Temper-turtle, which
slowly orbits the sun. The debris
-- dust particles usually no larger
than a grain ofsand ,, burn up in
the atmosphere, producing the
meteor activity. This event is
called the Leonid Meteor Shower
because the meteors appear to
emanate from the constellation
Leo.

According to Cadmus, an awe
erage year might yield a few dozen
Leonid meteors an hour. But ev-
eiy 33 years, the comet passes
closet to Earth, enriching the de»
bris ﬁeld through which the Earth
passes.

Because ofthis, some astrono»
mers prediCt that if the weather
is clear, statgazers could see a
meteor every few seconds. His»
totically, the Leonids have put on
quite a show. In 1966, asernOe
