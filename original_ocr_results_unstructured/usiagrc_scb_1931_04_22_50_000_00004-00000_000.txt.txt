Dear Si .

The Young Men's Christian assoc-
iation respondcd to student disapprov»
val of Prof. H. F. \Nm'd’s criticisms
of capitalism by presenting the other
side of the question in the biweekly
meeting, The protest took the form
of a demand for both sides of the
proposition after hearing the cnl
viewpoints of Paul Bianshard, Kirby
Page, and the 1931 Gates lecturer.

It is a reﬂection on our intelligence
tn believe that we could possibly fail
to get the conservative outlook on
our economic system. Our environ-
ment—press. church, home, business,
and secondary edilcationArendel‘S us
disposed toward the present system.
Furthermore, we are inherently cons
servative. We dislike continued res
adjustment, particularly in our think-
ing.‘

Conservative at Birth

Since conservatism was thrust upon l

us at birth, it does not take effort to
be conservative and, consequently,
most of us are. But it takes critical
and intelligent thinking to acquire
the radical and sympathetic type of
mind of a Harry Ward. Seeing the
conservative urge around and in us,
it seems that it was not both sides
of the question we wanted, for had
the speakers been conservative, there
would have been little concern over
getting the other side, These speakers
gave the other side, and how strange
it was to some!

One objection on the campus to
the critics in general is that they are
long on destructive criticism, but
short on anything constructive, This
is not so condemnatory. Did not de-
mocracy destroy before it could
build? But the conservatives are
guilty of the same thing of which
they accuse the nonscouformist. They
sling a few disrespectable words, such
as “radical" and “socialist." and for
lack of anything constructive to ate
for they point with a high degree of
self-satisfaction to the status quo.
This requires the least possible effort,

not convincing, they at least brought
enough student discussion to air a
few minds and expose some ignoi»
once, One student, predisposed to the
high perfection of our economic SySv
teni, went to one of the lectures and
found it rather provoking.
Loses Mental quiililli‘llnn
Apparently his i-atlonalizing mech—
anism was out of order, for he sin-
cerely and innocently asked whether
there were any people in this country
who could not afford a college educa-
tion. He did not know that there were
5,000,000 or more unemployed, and
that millions who are employed could
no more give their children a college
course than Lindbergh could have
‘flown across the Atlantic without an
‘airplane
This is not primarily a defense of
Mr. Ward's viewpoint. It is a criti-
cism of a type of individual on any
campus who cannot yet take a com-
prehensive view of ideas, other than
his own, without losing mental equi-
llbrium.
Very sincerely yours,
Howard Hush
