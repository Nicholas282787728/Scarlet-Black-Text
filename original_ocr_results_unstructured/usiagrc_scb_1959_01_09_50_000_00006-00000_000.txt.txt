Leaving directly from the Knox relays the convoy headed south
and took in the sights of the southland as they made their way

trip. The clinic provided much
for the boys to do, such as fish
fries, banquets, lectures and
workouts everyday.

According to Simone, Grin-
ncll was the outstanding small
college participating in the
event. There were 43 colleges
and universities making up
the two swimming teams of
the east and the west. The

chosen by their relationship to
