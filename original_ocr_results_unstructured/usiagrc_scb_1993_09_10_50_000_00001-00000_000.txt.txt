Why Are the Lines

at Cowles

so Long?

Dining Services Offer an Answer

Dieter King

( :OWLESDiningHallhnsbeen
plagued with long lunch and
dinner lines since thebegin-

ning of the year, as any frequent
patron wtll willingly explain at great
length. However, this old problem
has taken on a new dimension this
semester, as upper-class SluanLs have
been voicing concerns that lay the
blame for the long lines on over-
crowdingspecifieallyduetothelarge
freshman class.

“A lot of people are com-
plaining,” Stated SGA President.
Chad Finke. Indeed,aeursory glance
at tile faces in the Cowlcs line will
immediately confirm that students
aren’thappy widt the situation. Yet,
while the popular student perception
is that the inﬂux of freshmen is causr
ing theproblem,Dave McConnellof
Grinnell's Dining Services offers a
vastly different explanation.

According to McConnell,
the problem, quite simply, is prima
rily due to line cutting. ”Everybody
seems to cut on North,” stated
McConnell, adding that“ if people
didn’t cut there’d be a reasonable
Wait." What's a reasonable wait?
AccordingtoMcConnc11,Cowlcsean
process people at he rate of eight to
ten people per minute depending on
the type ofmeal served. Thus, with a
hundred people on llneitheapproxi—
male capacity ofthc area outside the
dining mom—ltshould only take the
last poison on line twelve and a half
minutes to beservedintheworstcasc
scenario.

Yet in a Scarlet 84 Black

study conductedon Wednesday,Sep-
[ember S, at Cowles dinner, it was
observed that the average wait for a
sludentwhoobedientlywaitedinline
after entering it from the end was
approximately twenty five minutes.

The same study also con»
firmed McConnell‘sasserlion: in the
period from 5:15 to 5:30, thirty two
people eul into the line. McConnell
estimates, that per night, ﬂppmxlr
mntely 80 lo 85 people cut the line.
Finke, however, characterized the
problem in reverse. He feels that the
long lines are prompting students to
cut, rather than cutting causing the
long, stagnant lines.

There are, according to Slu-
dentAffalrs, 1333 students currently
enrolled—434 of which are freshmen.
lt’s zl large class, but well within the
serving capabilities of Dining Serr
View, slates McConnell.

McConnell explained that
the cutting problem is endemic to
Cowlesbecauselhclayoulofthearea
outside the dining halliwilh three
entrances and a relattvely large area
to congregate "1711 makes itezlsy to
cut the line. This problem is minimal
to the point of being nonexistent at
Quad, once again, McConnell feels,
because of the layout of the waiting
area.

Although students have
called for an extensron of Cowles’
hours,McConnelloxplainedthatthis
would not be possible because of
staffing problems arising from stu-
dent \vorkers' evening schedules.
instead,McConnctlsuggestslhalstu-
dents on North Campus change their
behavior by not cutting and eating
South more frequently.

Campus Crime On the Increase
Grinnell Police Have No Leads and N0 Suspects

By Dieter King

HE‘beginnlng of the Full 5e
mester has been marred by
I an unprecedented spate of
campus wide thefts that has left slur
dents feeling irate,jaded and unsafe.
According to Jennifer Krohn of
GrinnellSludentAfl'airs,acombined
total of nine backpacks have been
stolen from Burling. the PEC and
Cowles dining hall since the begin—
ningofthesemester,thoughsheadded
that most of these thefts occurred in
the first week.
However, several bicycles have
been stolen each week since the se-
mester began, with the officially re-

ported number as of September 9th
standingalthlrteen.Thlsnumberlrlay
be significantly higher, however, as
litanystudentshavenotmadeofflcial
reports. There has also been one rc~
port of money being stolen from a
student’s room.

Krohn stated that “thirteen
[thefts] is a really high number for
little over a month.” Echoing a
similar sentiment, Chad Fluke, SGA
President, commented that“[campus
crime] seems to be worsethis semes-
ter. There's a lot more of it.”

Captain Lamb of the Grinnell
Police Departrnentwas more conser-
vative in his estimation of the prob-
lem, stating diat“there’salittle more
[crime] than normal. . . [occurring]

‘righl together. butnothing unusual."

The Grinnell PD is completely
without suspects and has no leads to
go on. Lamb explained that in the
past, thefts on eampus, particularly at
the beginning ofthe semester. could
be attributed to unscrupulous people
taking advantage of the beginning of
the semester confusion, to enter the
campus buildings anonymously and
steal at will. But he added that “[the
Grinnell PD] doesn't know What it's
got this time."

Both Lamb and Krohn advised
students to exercise reasonable caur
um and take simple precautions such
as locking room doors, not leaving
personal property unsupervised, and
locking up bicycles.
