the contest, the score was knotted
34734, but Creighton forged ahead
on one of Englehietson's tip ins.
Seconds later he connected again,
and "Red” Trish bagged another
to cinch the fight at 40735, after
Dean of Grinnell had added the
extra point to the Crinnell score
by way of the free throw lane.
Englebretson Tops Scorers

"Box” Englebretson, the league's
leading scorer and all-conference
foiward, chalked up 16 points to
walk off with the scoring honors.
12 of these coming in the last par
l‘iad. Trish looped in eight points.

Co-Captains Julie Bauer and
Harve oliphant led the Pioneers
with 10 points each.

McMurray, guard, popped in on-
ly three points but his spectacular
defensive play and floor show kept
the Creighton team at bay
throughout the game.

Pioneers Will Entertain
Billikens Here Monday

The Pioneers will have but two
days of rest after the gruelling
battle with the Creighton Bluejays,
before they meet the Billikan quills
tet from St, Louis university, the
Missouri oufit playing here Mons
day night at 7:30 o‘clock in a non—
conferencc clash,

Grinnell will have more than an
even chance 'of subduing the
southern team for the green, ins
experienced Billikans have only
two veterans. Capt. Herb Fash
and Dave Mattis are the two
lettermen. Mattis, a forward, did
not play last year, having stayed
out of school.

if comparative scores mean any7
thing, crinnell should find l'ttle
difficulty in dealing with the st.
Louis club, which was handed a
neat trimming by the Washburn
Ichabods earlier in the season.

Jacobson Art Exhibit Gives
Spectator Feeling of Monotony

Critic Terms Paintings
of Nature ‘Cannecl',
Disappointing

By Hmlry Alden

The first impression experienced
by the spectator at the exhibition
of oil paintings by Oscar Brousse
Jacobson, now on display in the
corridor and the drawing room of
Main hall, is one of delight at the
colorful vistas of mountain scen-
ery which are shown. Here he
sees a stretch of wasteland bound-
ed by jagged red peaks, there the
cool blue summits of the Rockies:
in his fancy he. visits Algeria and
Morocco, our own Northwest and
Southwest, and nearer scenes in
Colorado and Oklahoma,

The firm outlines of distant
langes, the silhouettes of mighty
trees and of bizarre desert plants,
the wide silver ribbons of rivers
stand out with poster-like sim—
plicity. And as the spectator goes
slowly in more critical medita-
tion, from picture to picture, he
is struck by a certain monotony
in subject and treatment.

Three Main Groups

It is true that the pictures vary
greatly in color, but even so, they
fall into three main groups: the
brown reds, of which “Burnt-Over
Land" is a characteristic canvas:
the blues, so well eexmplified by
”Estes Park"; and the greens, to
which class belongs the landscape
with the mystifying title. “Homer
war ."

Careful comparison reveals that
these paintings differ only in the
coloring; in pattern they are sim-
ilar. For the most part they rep-
resent a level plain or a lake or a
smooth-suface‘d river at the base
of a ridge of mountains, the whole
beneath a brilliant sky where hear
vy clouds~ln mass formations mim—
ie the rocks below. With one ex-
ception me canvases, which are
all the same size, are horizontal
panels: one picture, “Orabia
Wash," has a startling effest be—
cause the composition is vertical.

Products of Imagination

In spite of the painstaking way
in which the locale of the land»
scopes is noted in many of the

titles, the picturcs give the im—
pl'cssmn that they are products
of the imagination only; they are
canned nature, put up for travel
lbureaus. And like posters, they are
disappionting at short range;
'there is no subtlety in the tech-
nique as there is none in the lemon
tion which the paintings evoke.
Their greatest charm is that of
the picturesque; there is an exotic
fascination about some of the
North African scenes and such a
canvas as “Yucca: and Red Hills.”

Taken as a whole, the exhibi-
tion provides undeniable pleasure
One is grateful for the final
achievement of a system of indiv-
idual lighting that dispels tlic
‘Stygian gloom of the corridor and
lets one see with equal ease the
pictures there and those in the
drawing room. These clear ut
rugged paintings are as refresh—
ing as a guest of wind from “the
great outdooi
