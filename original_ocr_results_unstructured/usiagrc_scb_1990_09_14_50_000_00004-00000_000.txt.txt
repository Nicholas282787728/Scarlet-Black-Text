Face Worldwide
Struggle for
Territorial Rights

Amazonian Indian Describes Conﬂicts
with Poachers and Settlers; Expert
Discusses Deforestation in Malaysia

By Daniel Bliss

The Symposium on “Present
Struggles of Indigenous Peoples:
A Comparative Perspective”.
sponsored by the Rosenlield Pro-
gram, opened Tuesday witll an
overview of the issues involved by
Iohn Bodley, Professor of Anthro
pology at Washington State Uni
versity. As indicated by its title, the
symposium aims to lake a broad
look at the issue of indigenous
peoplesworldwide,comparingtheir
struggles together.

Bodley argued that the destruc-
tion of indigenous peoples world-
wide had taken a common path.
First, a policy, on the part of a
central government, of rapid develr
opment in a given
area, in some
cases uncon-
trolled, has, he
argued,unleashed
a litany of suffer-
ing on Lheoriginal
inhabitants of
suchanarea. This
has seriously dis-
turbed the way of
life of indigenous
peoples and as a
resultpopulations
have declined
drastically, This is followed by a
loss of political autonomy, with
increased central govemment in-
terference in the ways of life of the
indigenous peoples. Finally, he
stated, a loss of economic anion»
omy occurs as a result of resource
depletion, and indigenous peoples
become impoverished.

He also offered his definition of

The Wauja have been
shot at and had a site
sacred to them dese-
crated by poachers
and settlers who are
illegally on land rec-
ognized as theirs by

the Brazilians.

“indigenous",a term used now that
“primitive" and “tribal“ have been
rejected as inappropriate. He took
itto mean groups of peoplewho arc
sell'conlained, selfsufﬁcient socie-
ties as opposed to nation states and
colonies, On this basis there are
currently approximately 200 mil-
lion indigenous persons worldwide,
no more than in 1800, even though
the world‘s population has quin~
tupled since then. Most are now
concenuated in Asia, in particular
in China, india and the Soviet Une
ion. But he pointed out that geno—
cide and ethnocide against indige-
nous peoples has been worldwide,
not just in the Americas.

Perhaps the mosttellingexarnple
of this given by a speaker at this
symposiumis
that given by
Tupanym aka
Wauja, the
nephew of the
chief of the
Wauja tribe,
which lives in
north—central
Brazil. Until
1986, the
Wauja, wiut a
low but fairly
stable popula-
tion, had lived
relatively undisturbed in the Xingu
National Park and surrounding ar-
eas. Xingu was created by the
Brazilian government in 1961 as
recognition of Wauja land rights.

But in that year illegal lumber-
ing and ranching in Xingu, and at a
nearby Wauja shrine, Kamakuaka.
was discovered by the then chief,

later of an illness contracted from
white settlers) and other members
of his family including his uncle,
who succeeded his father as Chief.

Tupanymaka, speaking through
his interpreter Emi Ireland, herself
an indigenousrlghts activist, gave a
graphic account of the fullhormrot'
events over the past four years. He
talked of the desecration of the sa-
cred ground of Kamakuaka. which
had been turned into a cattle ranch.
and of extensive, illegal deforesta—
tion of surrounding land. Nearby
there was a new road, which led to
a small town which was brimming
with new settlers. Deforestation
had suddenly begun at an alarming
pace.

He also described a more recent
incident in which a group of tour
Wauja tribesmen ina dugoutcanoe
stopped a group of 16 people, in
high powered motorboats, heavily
armed, fishing illegally and for
commercial gain in Wauja terri-
lory. These people ﬁred on the
Wauja when requested to leave,
and continued to ﬁsh through the
night.

In addition, the Brazilian gov—
emmenthave proved loath to assist
the Wauja, in spiteofthe existence
of the Xingu Park. They have not
given the Wauja any money for a
motorboat of their own to patrol
their ten-itory, less still have they
sent any federal police to the area.
Whenadelegation of Waujapeople
attempted to meetwith the superinr
tendent in charge of Indian affairs,
they were refused an audience for
two weeks while they waited in
Brasilia. When they ﬁnally met
with the superindendent they were

past three years, Here too the gov-

emment turns a blind eye in the
name of private proﬁt.

The situation is further exacer-
bated by the fact thatin the name of
Brazilian nationalism the military
is maitaining a special status for
Brazil'snonhem and western fron-
tier regions, which is adding to the
inﬂux of white settlers, and the
mining, deforestation and disease
which they bring to an environment
with which they are totally unla-
miliar.

Robert Dentan, Professor of
Anthropology and American Stud-
ies at the State University of New
York-B uffalo, spoke ofeven worse
human rights abuses in Malaysia.
There the indigenous population.
which at barely 50,000 is less than
a quarter than that of Brazil’s own
much reduced indigenous peoples,
is not recognized as having any
land rights at all by the govern»
ment. Heavily in debt and strongly
authoritarian, the government has a
formal policy of deforestation and
destruction of native peoples that
will. if carried out, lead to the al»
most total removal of the Malayan
rain forest by the year 2000. It is
being replaced with plantation ag-
riculture and cottage industries,
which may be unsustainable for
long due to the weakness of tropical
soils. All this, in Denlan’s View, is
probably doing little more than
“ﬁnancing the Sullan’s gambling
debts."

Such problemscontinuc tooccur
in the United States as well. Here,
themain issues aremining and ﬁsh-
ing rights. Thomas Maulson, the
chief spearer of the Chippewa tribe
inWisconsin,pointedoutlhestrong
vested interests that the Chippewa
nation is ﬁghting in order to main
lain its rights across the area to fish
with spears. A key player in this is
