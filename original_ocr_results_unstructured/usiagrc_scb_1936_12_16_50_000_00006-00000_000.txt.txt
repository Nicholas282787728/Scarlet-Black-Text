Kohawks Beat Pioneers
Saturday Night, 28-26

team staged a brilliant last half
rally against Coe Saturday night,
but couldn't quite make the grade
and were defeated by a 28-26
score. The Pioneers. trailing 19.
10 at the half, outscored the Koa
hawks 16 points to 9 in the sec-
ond hatt, but the margin was too
great and the rally fell short.

The first part of the first per-
iod was even, both teams scoring
a basket and several free throws.
but the Coe offense suddenly he-
gan to click, and they left Grill»
neil far behind.

Coming back after halftime,
the Kohawk sharpsliooters iii-

points, but at this stage of the
game James LaMasney, Hal
Dean and John Hayward got to

about 30 seconds left to go, La-
Masney scored the basket which
brought the Pioneers within two
points of Coe, but the rally end—
ed there.

Big John Hayward for the sec-
ond time in two days showed
signs that he is fast becoming
one of the better fciwards, tossV
