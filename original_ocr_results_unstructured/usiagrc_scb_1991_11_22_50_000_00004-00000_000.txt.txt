The life and times
of Dave McConnell

By Julie Gard

“I like burritos, I like our chili and
grilled cheese I like most f ,“
stated Dave McConnell. Because he
“likes being around young people,”
McConnell enjoys serving as
Grinnell’s Director of Dining Ser-
vices.

Heseespartofhisjobas“adapting
to the changing needs of the commu-
nity." “While [dining services] can’t
be all things to all people. we can be
signiﬁcant to a significant number,“
said McConnell.

Acurrentchallengeis “smoothing
out the distribution of vegan choices
within the vegetarian program for the
few people who are vegans."

Besides directing Quad and
Cowles, McConnell serves on the
hazardous waste committee and“was
very instrumental with the recycling
effort."

Prior to his 16 years of service at
Grinnell, McConnell grew up in
Washington, D.C. and attended col-
lege in Nonh Dakota

“After getting over the culture
shock.1rea11y kind of fell in lovewith
the Midwest I found the people
charming; they relate well to one an,
other,” he said.

McConnell attended college on a
cross-country running scholarship.
He remembers his ﬁrst college race
and introduction to Midwestern
weather. He reminisced, “It was 19

degrees and there was iceon my face."

Since his college years,
McConnell’s interests have shifted to
more intellectual pursuits. He is in-
volved in the Leadership Iowa pro
gram. which promotes “higher qual-
ity education” in Iowa and is also
involved in issues such as health care
for uninsured children.

“If i had a hobby, it would be
communityservice,"saindConnell.

On an international level,
McConnell and his family “have en-
joyed serving as a host family for
Russian students at Grinnell over the
past several years.“ He stated, “I’m
notahistory buffof the SovietUnion,
but it‘s an area that's always held
great intrigue for me."

McConnell believes strongly in
the imponance of “being sensitive to
multicultural diversity” and “break
ing down barriers and stereotypes that
exist,” because of the fact that we're
“living in a global environment."

When not occupied with global
concerns, McConnell enjoys spend-
ing time with his two daughters. ages
seven and twelve. ”Both are very
active in creative dance, I guess is
what I would call it If you come to
our house for a meal or an evening,
you can‘tgetout withoutthem enter-
taining you with themodem music of
today,” he mused.

Professionally, he hopes to even-
tually teach on the College level or
serve in a higher administrative posi-
tion, putting to use his soon-robe-
acquired PhD. in leadership and
policy studies.

As far as the future and Grinnell
are concerned, McConnell said, “I'll
work at Grinnell as long as it‘s an
enjoyable experience.”

College’s energy consumption increased

By Gareth Fisher

___—_

Several weeks ago. a disturbance
at the power plant next to the science
building caused the campus to lose its
power for approximately two hours.
For most people, it meant a slight
delay in writing a paper, the inability

delay in a statistics lab that required
the use of computers.

Butwhat if the power had been out
a little longer? Dinner could not have
been cooked, the campus would not
have been lit, and many buildings
wouldslowly havebeguntoloseheat.
It requires only a little thought to
realize how much energy is imporr
tant to the daily running of Grinnell
College.

Thisimportanccisreﬂectedin the
college’s operating costs. According
to Waldo S. Walker, the director of
Physical Plant, the college had an
energy bill of $706,151 last year. Na-
tionally, 13% of all commercial enr
ergy use comes from educational in-
stitutions, according to the American
Council for an Energy Efficient
Economy.

How does all this energy get used
up? The college doesn‘t have exact
readings on which buildings use up
the most energy, because it does not
have separate meters for each build-

did say, however, that 58% of
Grinnell’s energy costs come from
electricity. According to the Annual
EnergyReview published by theU.S.
DeparttnentofEnergy.aircondition-

Oneof the mostused“appliances"
on campus are the computers. Bill

commercial buildings,Eurling,ARH/
Carnegie, the Fonrm, Fine Ans and
the Science Building are likely to be
the greatest offenders followed by
Darby because of the computers, and
Quad and Cowles because of cooking
appliances. The other residence halls
and smaller academic buildings such
as Goodnow and Herrick use up rela-
tively little energy.

What can be done to conserve en-
ergy? The campus community could
help by turning off an unnecessary
light or a computer terminal. Walker

cem. Ablank ter-
minal screen uses up as much elec-
Lricity as an incandescent lightbulb.
Energy use at Darby, where the main
frame VAX system is located, reached
its all-time peak level last year. The
VAX system at GCCS alone uses 50
times more energy than an average
incandescent 1i ghtbulb.

In one instance. a volleyball prac-
tice session in the gymnasium com-
bined with thenorrnal useof the com-
puters overloaded the electric circuits
at Darby, causing the entire VAX
system to crash.

Francis quickly added that the re»
placement of old equipment this {all
has reduced the energy need of the
computer systems, and that this fact
alone is saving the college $10,000-
15,000. Nevertheless, since the col-
lege has replaced simpleVAX tenni-
nals elsewhere on campus with PC
and Macintoshes which use up more
energy, Francis wonders whether the
college is really saving money.

So which buildings consume the
most energy? Since large ﬂoorspace

have to". He
said he was interested in an energy
conservation analysis.

Apparently, energy was a much
larger concern on campus during the
1970’s, when oil was much more
expensive. Burling used to be almost
exclusively lit by ﬂuorescent lamps.
However, when thebuilding was reno-
vated in the early 80's, incandescent
lightwas added even though ﬂuores-
cent light uses up 6070% less en
ergy, according to the American
Council for an Energy Efficient
Economy.

Energy use at Grinnell has in—
creased slightly in the last few years,
and a reduction would save the colr
lege a great deal of money, not to
mention a yeat deal of natural re-
SOUI'CCS.
