SANDWICH from page 6

1994, the four founding fathers of
BIG Sandwich Night, Seth “Captain"
Bernsen, Zach “‘Wich Doctor"
Stevens, Karl “BF Good ‘Wich"
lohnson,andBrent“GlendatheGood
‘Wich” Dexter met in the hallway of
Cowles 2nd in accordance with the
Mission Statement and “slammed-it
home" (to eat the entire sandwich at
one sitting), thereby establishing the
ﬁrst of many BIG Sandwich Nights
and spawning the now ofﬁcial stu-
dent organization, BIG Sandwich
Club

The actual origin of the concept
of BIG Sandwich Night is an oral
tladition and can only be heard by
attendees.

Since then, attendance at BIG
Sandwich Night has been growing
steadily. The record number of at»
tendees so far is 21. although the
most people toactually panake of the
‘wich and who have “slammedit
home" in one night is 18 and II
respectively. As the BSC plan reads,
“We are setting records every week.
It’s insane!"

Who attends BIG SandwichNight?

addition to the “Basic Four," the at-
tendee makeup is quite diverse. In
addition, if you come, you might get
toseethatparticular week‘s celebrity
guest. Past guests have include Grin-
nell Mayor Bob Anderson and the
track coach, Will, whose last name I
Can’t quite remember right now but
who is manied to Evelyn and whose
Snapple I accidentally drank out of.

This is Iowa, where oral sex is a
crime; is BIG Sandwich Night le-
gal?

The Grinnell Police Department
conﬁrmed that there is no legal re-
stn'ction to the size of sandwiches in
Iowa. However, I neglected to ask
about the legality of the typical pas-
senger/door ratio of four to one in the
typical BIG Sandwich vehicle.

Are BIG Sandwiches dangerous?

Matt Cochran’s mom at the
Health Center said that although ev-
eryonereacts differently toBIG sand-
wiches,eating them should besafe as
long as it is done in moderation.
However, she did go on to say that
“BIG Sandwiches and alcohol don’t
mix," because if you do too much of
both, you could asphyxiate.

How has BIG Sandwich Night al-
fected its members?

The effects vary from person to
person. One person said they put on
a few pounds One anonymous male
member (not the mayor orWill) even
said, “[Before BIG Sandwich night,
my life was] boring, dull, mediocre,
empty, meaningless. I wasa woman.
I wore women‘s clothing I was
really lost."

What are some of the goals of the
BIG Sandwich Club?

In addition to the goals in the
Mission Statement some members
have personal goals for themselves
and lheclub. Zach said thatoneofthe
goals of BSN is to “get as many
people in one vehicle as possible—
18 is the record so farI believe." Karl
then added, “My personal goal is to
get a poster-sized picture of Pam

An anonymous memberthen shouted

What does the future have in store
for BIG Sandwich Night?

Well, rumors have been flying
aboutt—shirls,a BSNhousenextyear,
2 Harris Party in the spring (the BSN
“Bread Ball") and possibly BSC
branches at other schools. However,
as BrentsaysaboutBSN,“"l‘histhing
is bigger than all ofus," so it‘s hard to
tell exactly where BSN will go.

I’m interested in attending BSN.
Are there any laux pas I should try
to avoid?

The only major ones I can think
of are: a) Do not corrupt or alter the
term “slammit home" and all of its
tense conjugations. For example, do
notsay“l am going toslammildown"
or “I am going to consume the whole
sandwich, dudes”; and b) Do not ask
for or bring chips.

Isn’t this how that thing in Waco
started?

Mary,t.heofﬁcialBlG Sandwich
l-Iy-Vee register worker, said that she
was not wonied at all about BSN
being a cult and in fact stated, “I
enjoy seeing them every Wednes-
day. They‘re all nice and pleasant.“
Andifyoucan’ttrustMary,thenwho
can ya?

All right,I’m sold, hutI don’tI like
to do anything without checking
with Pam first. 15 this whole thing
O.K. with her?

Mst Ferguson herself said about
BSN, “I think it‘s a really great idea,
I look forward to coming soon,” and
forcefully denied the possibility of
BSN being a leftist plot to overthrow
the dining services (the actual quote
was, “Oh, for goodness sakes, no").

If BIG Sandwich Night sounds like
something you could use in your life
and you’re interested in coming to

A hearing then is scheduled and
the student is allowed to respond to
the charges. The student can bring
with him or her a non-participating
adviser to the hearing. Usually, this
person is an academic adviser, a fac-
ulty member, an SA or an RLC. The
faculty member suspecting the slu»
dent has no involvement in the hear-

lessen the incidence of academic dis»
