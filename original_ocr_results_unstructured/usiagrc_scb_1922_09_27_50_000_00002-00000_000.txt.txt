EDUCATION RESTRICTED

College presidents and professors
who are firm in their belief that a
college education should be granted
only to the intellegensia, rather than
being a universal right, have found
a. champion in President Ernest M.
Hopkins of Dartmouth College, who
declared in his opening address he-
fore' the college September 21 that
'there was not enough selection ‘le

The last issue of the Scarlet and

from our own President Main, Sup?
porting this theory: “It should he

have adopted it. In our own system
here, as adopted this year, grades do,

record of grades in High School, let
it lie remembered, is not the only
test applied here. The grade attained
in High School is, of course, one of
the important tests applied tn the

class. Great importance was given

Barr, psychology teaches that a per

is too broad in his statement when he
says that “you can’t measure brains."

says cooperation for common ends.
which is perhaps the most valuahlc
thing in college life, can he gained
only through fellowship. He believes
{in tile co-uperatiou or student and rac-

leads to greater things." “College is

It is coinmollly stated that college
is preparation for lile. President Main
takes e option to the statement in
his hehet that college is life itselt.
“It is not the host of lite but the best

putting it. "Get the most you can

As President Main expresses it he
is an ’incllrable optimist, a boy who
has never grown up.” His doctrine of
living is to obtain from life the most
'joy possible; to appreciate the bédull»
,rul things life presents and get true
happiness from the knowledge or theru.
From this doctrine comes one at his
lhohbies — that of walking out—doors
‘at night when trivial experiences may
be overshadowed by the greatness of
nature. He adds, “Life is a serious
lbusiness, but it should abound with,
