THE ATHLETIC Union meeting
on'Monday was well attended by
a large number or track and base
ball men. The names of the can
didates tor the track team were
handed in, ivith the events they
intend to enter. The list was a
long one and showed a good re-
presentation trom the new stue
dents. There are new men in
nearly all the events, who hid [air
to hold positions on the team.
There are. however, many neu-
students who could be valuable
additions to the team and who, as
yet, have not entered the gymna-
sium or shown any intention of
working on the track. We would
urge all the students to go into
the gymnasium and, it tlley have
any inclination toward track atllr
letics. to enter the training squad
in the spring, whether or not the)
have ever before taken part in
any athletics.

WITHIN THE last few weeks, a
negligence on the part ot the
men's societies with regard to the
measures preliminary to the cor.
nell debate has been disclosed
which can not be blamed U70
severely. In the ﬁrst place the
date of the joint debate between
the Grinnell Institute and the
Chrestomathean Society for the
purpose ot choosing speakers for
the Cornell debate was postponed
so long that ﬁnally the prelimi-
nary debate was entirely given up
and the speakers were elected by
a vote of the two soCieties; a
method not nearly as satisfactory
as the regular preliminary con-
test. Again, a teiv days ago, it
was discovered that March 3rd
was the date for the Cornell dee

bate. when the debaters and every
one else had been led to suppose
that it was March I7. thus leavmg
the speakers only three weeks to
ﬁnish the preparation of their m.
gumcnts. Unless the debate can
be postponed a week or two, oui
debaters will be compelled to
speak at a great disadvantage. It
would seem that the committee
in charge ot the debate has been
almost criminally careless in al-
lowing such a slate of affairs to
come to pass. We can be sure
that our opponents at Cornell did
not put off then-preliminary cori-
test until it was too late, or lose
track of the date on which the
debate with Iowa College was to
occur.i It seems that right here
we have an excellent solution to
the problem which has been troub~
ling us lor so long, why we can
not win in debate Wl\l‘l other cole
leges. If we ever do expect to
come out victorious we must at-
tend to business a good deal hard-
er than we have this year. The
men who have charge of making
arrangements torthedeoaleought
to reel lhat they hold a responsi-
ble posilion and corduct them-
selves accordingly instead of let-
ting things slide as they have
thus far. Carlessness and indif-
ference Wlll never win a debate
.lntJ the sooner “e understand this
the better.

Chicago University students are
making preparations to receive
Governor Roo'tcvelt, who is to
give an address before tllem April
Io. on some subject conlIeCIed
with his Cuban campaign.

S. U l is negotiating with U.
nt Pennsylvania to obtain a game

of foot ball with them to be play-
ed at Iowa City. There are very
ﬂattering piospects for the suc»
cess of the negotiations.
