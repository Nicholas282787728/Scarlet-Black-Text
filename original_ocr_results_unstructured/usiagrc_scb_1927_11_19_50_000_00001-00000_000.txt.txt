the Scarlet and Black should enjoy a

a long list of letter men and near let-

Truesdale-will have some trouble pick-

togs next week, leads the veterans re-
turning from last vear. Pctersoh'is

Corrough, Wilhelm, De Long and
Sharnhorg are the best exsyezlrlillgs

science, as his record at Grand Rapr

Mason Tells of Two Forbidden
Cities In the Interior of
Yucatan Last Night.

“There once existed in Central Am-
erica a civilization which reached a
magnificence and complexity compar-
able to that of Greece ol' Egypt and
which was the highest type ever evol-
ved in the New World prior to the
coming of Europealls‘the civilization
of the Mayan people of Yucatan " This
was the theme of Gregory Mason, arch-
eologist, speaking on "The Lost Cit-
ies of Yucatan" last night at the Con-
gregational church. His talk, vividly
illustrated with stereopticon and mo-
tion pictures, was the second number
on the lecture course. Professor E. B.
T. Spencer introduced the speaker.
The possibility of discovering this
mysterious civilization was the motive
which prompted . Mason to lead a
scientific expedition into this region
two yezlrs ago. Due to the refusal of
the natives to admit foreigners and to
the jagged coast and shallow waters
along Yucatan, the country had never
been visited by white men since the
Spaniards had deserted it in 1521.
"After permission had been granted
by the Mexican government and by the
natives," began Mr. Mason, “the five
Americans and a few natives compris-

first city, we dicovered others in our
explorations, five near the coast and
one more inland.

"Our work was hindered by the fact
that. both the Mexican and native gov-
ernments [orbit] all excavation," con-
tinued Mr. Mason, "so that all W0
could do was to uncover what we saw.

Asks Men If Their Friends Will
Remember Them At Their
Best Always.

“Willlthe pcople with whom you
collie in conflict remcmher you at your

Geistweit to the men of the Y. M. c.
A in the Association building last
Thursday night.

"I often wonder if the men against
whom I played football remember me
at my best, ii the hundreds of high

school students to whom I have talked ,

remember me at my best, if my best
friends in college remember me at my
best,” Continued the Reverend Geistr
wcit. “if I was not up to par, they
will not remember me at my best.
"Whose fault lﬁ it that people do not
remember me at my best? it is my
own. It is my inability to make the
most of the‘thiugs about me," the
speaker declared. He cited the case of

it prisoner who lived on a bread and,

water diet, and yet, because he had
that inner vision, he was able to en-
jay his diet because it was the best
he could have.

Twice on Sunday, the Reverend

First Baptist church, of which he is
pastor, cannot accomodate the great
numbers who desire to hear him.

MESS SAYS WE STILL
PAY FMSl WARS

Emigration to Southwest Causes
Wars Which Still Affect
American Thought.

"The effects of the movement of the
American population into the Smith—
wost are found in thc Texan revulu»
tion and the Mcxican War, a war for
which we have paid a penalty ever
since," said Dr. Frederick Mcrk in his
lecture on "The Movement into the
southwe. given last Wednesday cv.
ening.

“The movement into the rich tide-
wnter soil of Texas began in 1321, just
after Mexico had won her indepen—
'denco from Spain,” stated Professor
Mei-k. "The U. S, had assumed a be-
nevolent altitude toward Mexico as a
young republic, and Mexico was eager
to attract American settlers into Tex—
as; they wanted American citizens
within their domains in case help was
needed against Spain.

“Land was offered to American set~
tiers on such generous terms that by
1830 there were 15,000 of them in Tex~
asii‘onr times as many Americans as
,Mcxicans. However, about this time
Mexico began to realize the danger of
getting too many foreigners within her
borders. Accordingly, she set about
to discourage the settlement of Texas
by any more Americans, only to find
that her restrictive measures were too
late—they merely led to increased
friction between me two factions."

I The lecturer said that the fundamen—

the Anglo-Saxons inherent sense of
superiority over the southern races.
The Mexicans were “greasel‘s.”

East, Asserts Historian

By Dorothy Will.

“What is the value of history?
Surely you don't want to hear morc of
history?" Dr. Frederick Merk smiled
quizzicaliy.

“Well—history, as you know, is the
record of thc past experiences of man.
Its value lies in the opportunity it
offers us of benefiting from the er-
rors oi the past, and of building on the
basis of the successes of the past, I
should say that it enlarges our mental
horizon, and it ought to make for
greater tolerance.

"Tile study of history," he continued,
“uncovers for each nation the errors
and crimes it has committed and it
ought to make that nation more tolei»
ant of the errors and crimes of other
people. History is often used, however,
for the opposite purpose of concealing
our own shortcomings and exaggerate
ing those of others.”

“Do you think the presentation or
history will change in the ncxl few
yenrsi" I questioned.

“No, I think not. It seems to me
that the great changes have already
taken place. History is no longer an
attempt to teach chronology, but to
give the student an understanding of
the forces that have brollght about
development in the history of man.
And as for the importance attached to
history in Grinneil, I think it is very
well appreciated here." He nodded
his head approviiigly, '

“Is there any outstanding way in
which history would be benefited
nbove other subjects by the method of
study recently adopted by Harvard?"

"I do not believe that it would. stu-
dents would get as much out of other
subjects as out of history under such
a scheme."

My question as to his opinion of
"Big Elli" Thompson's attempt to keep
King George out of history books

politics."

ball unc when the Grinneil eleven

tins afternoon.

Attendance from Saturday morning
in s indichied that a goodly num-,
brr ol' Scarlet and Black supporters
would be on hand ﬁlls afternoon in
Ames to lend moral support to the
Pioncc~- in their last grid game of the
season. '

Captain Sonny Davis, Boss Eynhn
and Russell king y are the seniors
who Will play for Grinneil for the last
time. Contrary to reports, Ray Cler
land. who has been declared by many
to also play his last gamc today, will
be eligible for another year's-compe-
tition, and is expected back in ilie Pin-
ncer camp again next fall, according
to assistant coach Lester Duke.

.inics Expects Eaéy Win,

A disastrous season as far as games
won and lost are concerned. the Pio—
neers are entering today's game as
the underdog, and are doped to take
another walloping. This is not the
idea present in the minds of the Scar-
lct and Black athletes, nor their >
coaches. With the Alnes team boast—
ing a .500 per cent rating in the val-
ley, while Grinneil has nothing, the
lows State' team is looking for an
easy win to‘ place them on an equal
basis with the Kansas Aggies and ck.
iaboma. Amos boasts of holding the
strong Cornhnsker team to a so
game, and also turning back the Drake
Bulldogs. Both of these teams hund—
ed Gl'innell healthy beatings.

Coach L. L, Watt has been casing up
on the practice sessions during the
past week, assuring the Pioneers of
having their full strength in the iicld
against the Cyclones. Captain Davis,
who has been suffering from a boil i .
tection, and Ciel-and, whose injured
shoulder is not yet in the best of con<
dition, are the only Grinneil players
who are not up to playing form, but
will be able to perform in able style
this afternoon. “Skinny" Evahn, kick-
er deluxe, has been speedily recover—
ing from the leg injury which kept
him out of the Wisconsin game, and
will doubtless be on the starting end
of a goodly number of fine punts. In
addition the scrappy Atlantic product
will do a good share of the forward
passing, a department of play which
will be used by Grinneil this afternoon
to a large extent.

Miller Is Injured.

An injury of Johnnie Miller, Aines'
scorer extraordinary. has forced
Coach Workman of the Cyclones to
shift his lincup to a marked degree.
l<ulp, a senior of diminutive propor—
tions from Davenport is reported to be
the Ames cuftcll’s first choice for the
vacant berth.

The Grinneil delegation left Des
Moines this morning via a special in—
ter-urban train, containing also a
large crowd of Des Moines alumni and
local college frosh team and band. A
large section in the Ames stadium has
been reserved for Grlnllell supporters,
assuring the Pioneers of a consider—
able amount of vocal support. The
varsity and freshman squads will be
gucsts at a banquet, the "Varsity
East," in their honor at Younker's .
Tea room. At this time a football cap-
thin for next season will doubtless be
chosen.
