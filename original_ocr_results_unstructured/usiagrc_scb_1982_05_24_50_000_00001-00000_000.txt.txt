Taking a look back, 1978 - 1982

Highlights from days gane by

by Anne Rawland

Today marks me close of another
Chapter in the lives of some 285 Grins
nellians who will cross that imaginary line
between student and alum. This year’s
class participated in all of those things we
were promised as part or the “Grinnell Ex-
perience." Even though we chose to attend
this college in the Cornfields we found
tough academics, co—ed bathrooms and, of
course, the Pub. What follows are
highlights of the past lour years, in
complete to he sure, but it is hoped that
they will bring back personal memories
[or each and every one of us.

Freshman Year
1978-79

In the heat of late August, 412 new Grin-
nellians arrived on campus trnm almost
every state in the union and other parts of
the globe. A class of 53.4 percent men and
45,6 percent women, we boasted an
average SAT score of sea verbal and 590
math. When asked to list possible majors,
our seven most popular answers were
biology (22 percent), English (15 percent).
political science (14 percent), psychology
(13 percent), economics (13 percent).
history (12 percent), and chemistry 11]
percent).

In September, 173 of us learned the new
drinking law made us unwelcome in the
Pub until our 19m birthday, During the
same month Fredrick L. (Fritz) Maytag
III became the new chairman of the Board
of Trustees. Second City Touring Company
made us laugh and the football team won
its first game against Iowa Wesleyan mm.
The team went on in fine Grinnell style to
finish the year with two wins and six
losses.

Undoubtedly, the biggest imprﬁsion
made that first month was the tornado. It
seems fitting that the class which
graduates on the 100th anniversary of the
destruction of the college campus was
ushered in by this menace of nature.
Although the tornado oi September 16,
ms, stayed south of town, it killed six peo-
ple and wiped out several buildings. A slab
of concrete still marks the spot where Mit-
lchell’s Onestop once stood.

away at a new campus alcohol policy,
Peter Erspamer spent 12 hours trapped in
Skunk Cave while on a GORP outing, Pro-
lessor oi History David Jordan brought the
Mears Issue to the forefront and in
December Grinnell made the national
scene when a Fortune magazine article ap
peared with the headline “A Small College
Scores Big in the Investment Game,”

when we returned to campus in
January, we learned A. Richard iurner
had resigned as Grinnell president and
George Thorogood and The Destroyers
were scheduled to entertain. Also during
the spring semester, the taculty abolished
Skip Day, “Messiah" David Kramer
became SGA presrdent-elect, Dave MC-
Connell found out through hls survey what
we already knew 7 Special-K Loaf was by
far ﬁle least popular item on the menu,
skip Day was held without faculty ape
proval and we participated in our first
relays.

Sophomore Year
1979-80

The new academic year ushered in a
new college president and a new format
for the 5&8. Student opinion divided on the
tormer but came down strongly against
the latter.

Also in the fall, President George Drake
kicked off the new Convocation Series, the
5518 printed its first issue, the Pope visited
Des Moines, Hardees opened, Senator Ed-
ward Kennedy had us waiting in line out»
side Darby Gym in November, and a group
of students held a drink-in to protest the
new Forum “dry" policy, The policy We
mains.

In the spring a female student was
allegedly raped near campus, Also, the
SGA approved funds to fly Associate Proe
fessor of Political Science H. Wayne

and the TV sale would increase our endow-

General Hospital and RA Barb Gaddis was
ordained a Presbyterian minister in Her-

Senior Year
1981-82

After moving back to campus for the last
time, we found a remodeled post office,
handicapped ramps attached to the Forum -
and this publlcation was finally back to a
lormat more befitting of a newspaper.

During the fall, Andrea Griswold took
over control of the Health Center, Luther
Allison played the blues, the State Fire
Marshal condemned the Fine Arts base»
ment, a computer scandle erupted and
sophomore Mark Lieberson dropped out in
November to buy the Longhorn,

Our final spring semester brought the
Burling renovation, two protests organized
by the South African Support Group, the
Dan Magurshak tragedy, the return of Jim
Post, a decade of decadence complete with
so kegs at the Relays and still no promises
on Mears.

As we Cross the finish line, a few paints
are worth noting:

- Although we have been accused of
apathy, we have certainly participated in
a changing Grinnell. Among other things
we helped choose a new president and
gave constructive criticism during almost
every phase of the campus iace—liit.

I We have forced the trustees and the
administration to begin listening to us on
matters such as Mears and South Africa.
In addition, because of continued protest,
.lim Tederman recently announced
underclassmen will be allowed to remain
in the dorms through graduation.
