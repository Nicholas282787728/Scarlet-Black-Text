A REFLECTION 0N GRINNEIL STANDARDS.

A week ago today an article in the SCARLET
AND BLACK told of the popularity of the rental shelf
established at the library last spring; today the story
is told in our news columns of the purloining of a
growing number of books from that same shelf, pre—
sumably by students.

Such a statement is a reflection on a certain type
of student at Grinnell, who maintain no pretense of
respect for the righm of others at the library, whose
motto is "Grab While the Grabbing is Good" and
Whose conduct causes an atmosphere of distrust at the
library that is most regrettable.

For the matter of the rental shelf is only 5. more
obvious phase of a wide-spread situation at the lib—
rary. It is common knowledge that the mere fact
that a book is indexed and not reported out by the
librarians is no assurance at all that it really is in the
stacks. If someone has happened to want to take the
book, the chances are he has never even stopped at the
library desk to register the fact. Then when that
hook is suggested by some prolessor as a valuable one
for students in a certain class to read, each one of
them takes nve minutes to find out where to locate
the volume, only to had a blank space storing them
in the face when they finally reach the right shelf.

Such a condition obtains especisuy when a profes-
sor assigns a report. recommending a series of refer-
ence works, without putting them on reserve. In

 

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

such a case the person who starts his preparation late
is simply out of luck. Earlier arrivers have cooly
walked home with the volumes they need, which
usually contain the beat material,

We realize that to call the attention of such stur
dents as will appropriate rcntal books and walk off
with hooks from the stacks to the gross selﬁshness of
such a policy is probably futilc. Nevertheless, it is
hoped that when anyone is discovcrcd doing either of
these two things. his associates will severely repri-
mand him in such terms that eventually the practices
may be stopped. Until this happens, a closer scrur
tiny of students’ behavior at the library will he neces-
sary. Miss Smith even implies in her statement that
if the appropriation of rcntal books continues, the
rcntal shelf can not be selfrperpetuhting and will have
to be abolished in the future.

Much meaningless sunshine is sometimes
broadcast about the Golden Rule, but here is one place
where Grinnell students should apply it.

A WEEKLY BULLETIN.

At Grinnell, the part played by extra curricular
evenfs such as lectures, musicial recitals, and plays in
the educational scheme is not inconsiderable and there
fore it would seem desirable to attract as many stu—
dents as possible to these affairs. This can only be
done by an organized and effective system of pub-
licity.

The bulletin of the year's events which appears at
the beginning of the semester in the SCARLET AND
BLACK as well as such other college publications as
the Y. M. C. A. handbook is a good start to acquaint
Grinncllians with the year’s plans, The first bulletin
however, is necessarily rather incomplete and tentative
since it cannot list all the events occurring throughout
the year and since those events which are announced
must sometimes he dropped or postponed due to un-
foreseen circumstances.

To insure the Grinnelllan's keeping up to date
with what is being planned in extra curricular enter-
tainment why couldn't a bulletin be posted on the
board every Monday morning listing the events to take
place for the coming week and giving such details as
time. place and charge, if any? Such a bulletin could
also be run in the SCARLET AND BLACK the sat—
urday preceding the week in question. This would
not only enable the student to get up to date informa—
tion on what was being planned but would allow him
to cover the complete list of the year's events. By
being issued at the beginning of the week it would
also allow the student to budget his time so as to in-
clude some of those affairs which most interested him.
