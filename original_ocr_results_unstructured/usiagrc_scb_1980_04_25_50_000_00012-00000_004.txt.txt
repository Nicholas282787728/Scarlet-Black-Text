in this day of the waning chaperon it

requires real dexterity to keep a man

_ on the string and yet never let him get
an opportunity to make a direct pass.

. Olten you would like him as a bean,
but not as a lover. it you ever give a
man a chance to declare his inten-
tions, honorable or otherwise, in words
or by pantomine, your iriendship is
over and you have only two alter-
natives—to take him up on it or to
refuse him. of course, a man will not
go on torever in the role of potential
lover, but it you are clever, you can

. gain time by seeing to it that he never
has a real opportunity to explain his
feelings. Avoid romantic atr

for any great length of time. in a taxi-,
cab you can talk on brightly and in-
nocently, {or nothing puts a man off
like conversation, and when all else
fails, there is always a cigarette.

The technique of warding off passes
is one which every girl should perfect.
Not but what she gets all the
necessary opportunity, as there is
something about the atmosphere of a
taxicab that makes the most indii-

The editor replies: We would like to
make clear that we accepted Mr.
Roines’ ad not out of compassion, but
strictly for the bucks. We frankly
could care less it he wants to indulge a
death-wish mania. We accepted this
ad because it put us over the four hun-

revenues for the 197%30 fiscal 5&3
year. Since the editor's salary is fixed
as 10 percent or total ad revenues,
yours truly made a sweet 40 G's this
year. Thanks, Mr. Roines. See ya,

When ‘all is said and done, discretion
is what counts. It is the girl who just
must tell on herself who gets into Lrou»
ble. Often she will be far more innor
cent than the quiet, subtle type who
does pretty much as she pleases, but
knows how to keep quiet about it. or
course. it seems all wrong that in this
world appearances count for more
than actions, but it has always been so
and we can do nothing but accept it.
Even those of us who most dislike
hypocrisy have to think at the looks oi
the thing.

No matter how many times you
have been to a man's house, always
act as if it were a first visit. Remarks
such as: “Do the new curtains in your
room keep out the light?” or: “Oh,
look, the solo now faces the window,”
imply a greater intimacy than might
exist and are never appreciated by the
host. More women give themselves
away lrom vanity than from
carelessness, Don't let your vanity get
the better of your common sense.
Anyway, it’s good technique to be
discreet.
