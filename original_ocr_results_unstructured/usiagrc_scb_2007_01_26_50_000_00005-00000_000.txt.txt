Casablanca (1942)
*tttﬁ

Even jaded Grinnellians have a
soft spot for this love story

Car/1110mm 1s otten cdled one ofthe greatest films
ever 111 1dc, and the swanky noir classic didnt disapr
point this first time Viewei. The films ungmul sub~
title was “IVIystei'tous City or $111 and intrigue! and
the film delivers that and more

Cami/mint is set in Morocco circa WWII, where
wealthy Europeans who have ﬂed hem German oc-
cupirion await exit visas to tly to Lisbon, and event
tually to freedom in rhc United States. y spend
their days of purgatory frequenting “gi nts” like
Rick’s Cafe’ Americain, where the liquor ﬂows freely
and even the head of the local police (Claude Rains)
joins in the illegal gambling. The proprietor ofRick’s
Cafe is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), an Ameri-
can expatriate with a mysterious past.

At the beginning of the film, Rick comes into
possession of two sets of transit papers allowing the
holders to leave Casablanca. At the same time, an
old ﬂame enters his life, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman),
who broke Rick’s heart a year earlier when she ended
their affair.

Ilsa is currently married to Victor Laszlo (Paul
Henreid), a wealthy Czechoslovakian who was a
member of the underground movement ﬁghting
against German occupation. Laszlo is still an import
(ant leader of the underground, and is wanted by Ger
man officials in Casablanca.

Rick is faced with a difﬁcult decision: should he
use the transit papers to run away with llsa, whom
he still loves, or should he allow Ilsa and Victor to
escape, nobly sacriﬁcing his own future?

While Rick’s dilemma and the ﬁlm's intricate plot
are riveting, the movie's real strengths are its d1alog11e
and cinematographm choices. Rick, in his unmistak-
able gruff drtiwl, utters line afte line that have since
become famous7 “Here's looki at you, kid," and “I
think this is the beginning ota beaut1ntltr1endsh1p,”
just to name two.

The film also pcrfcctlv evokes the desperate grant
deur of the lifestyle of Europes exiled wealthy, set
agamst the shadowy niches of Ricks and the tinkling
music provided by sam the pi1111o player (Boole?
Wilson).

Some modern v1ewers might and the film’s melo-
dramatic love scenes, with their soundtrack of swelh
1ng violins, somewhat trying. But th1s is a movie well
worth the price of temporaiily setting aside your cyn-
icism. Caron/111m is classic with good cause: it offers
an absorbing plot, excellent acting, snappy dialogue
and some of the most famous scenes in mov1e his—
tory.

Stop worrying and love this Col

Di Strange/ow m:17'aw 1 Lcmlrt'rl m Soy; Wayne
mg and Law the Bowl, the 1enowned black comedy
classic nominated to. four 1964 Academy Awards,
delves into the psyche or a paranoid America during
the arms race with Russia.

The story’s central plot line is an “accidental" nor
clear attack on Russia by wayward American General
Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), and the attempts of
the “organized" American government to halt the B-
52 bombers from reaching their primary drop zones.

we watch as three comical struggles unfold: the
conﬂict between the psychotic Ripper and his see-
ondrinrcommand who tries to call off the strike,
the attempts of the confused bombers to ﬁgure out
whether their orders are Valid;:lnd the phone conver—
sation in the War Room between the U.S. President
and the drunken Soviet Premier.

The dialogue between the president and the pre—
mier is one of the film’s highlights. Kubrick’s play on
words is superb as he illustrates the confusion and
incompetence of both governments. The president
continually speaks to the premier as ifhe were a child,
downplaying the dropping ofthe bomb as only a “silly
thin

\that really scares the Americans is not then own
actions, but information from the Russian Ambassa-
dor: an attack on Russia will automatically trigger a
“Doomsday Machine which will in essence, destroy
the world.

While Kubrick's other films: Flt/l IWcI/II jar/sci,
alert-room Orttrlgl and 2001:A Spare oilyrny are note
worthy for their excellence, D11 SII'mIgd/a-w is certain-

few idiosyncratic twists, right?

on no. The 1sn’t Walt Disney. This is genius. Till
Primer: Bride is an invaluable life tool. Cliffsclimba
ing techniques are featured prominently, as 1s the very
important skill otleaping out ofa window and onto
a horse without harming one's groin. If you ever must
best a genius, you'll know about building tolerance to
iocane powder. It’s unwise to get involved in a land
war in Asia. And seriously, you should probably run
ognize the man you love even ifhe’s wearing a black
Zorro mask.

All irresistible quotables aside, there’s a secret ins
gredient to T1}: Primes: Bria/c (stop that rhyming now,
I mean it!) that no one can really explain, something
that makes everything feel a little bit better (anybody
want a peanut?). It makes us tccl older and younger
and hopeful and sardonic all at the same time.

But more than that, it’s reassuring. Some part of
11s hopes that The Primers Bride is actually rcalt To
watch th1s movie is to, howcvcr brieﬂy, exist in t1 place
whcrc things are fair and good and you dont have
to worrv about graduation oi adulthood. It takes us
out oto'u1 perceived ﬁle swamps away from our own
Cliffs ofIiisanin and into the safe protected {11th
house whcie Westley (Cary Elwes) and Buttercup
(Robin Wright) tiist meet and she ﬁrst orders him
around like the donilncciing wcncli that She Is We
know that Westley 11nd Buttercup will get together,
that e111l wdl be punished and good rewa1ded We rc-
member a time when we believed VVestlev was right:
“Death cannot stop true love " And the best part is
that this safe, light, magical world isn't boiuig at all—
it's funny and fun and even intelligent (although still
kind ofsckisr).

You may look to \IS, as seasoned Punter: Brno
Viewers, to tell you what secret ingredient makes this
movie so darn goodWc have no idea, but we feel like
it might be that same nasty brown pellet ofunidentir
fiilble composition that returns Westley to the world
of the living. Or maybe it’sjust iocane powder.
