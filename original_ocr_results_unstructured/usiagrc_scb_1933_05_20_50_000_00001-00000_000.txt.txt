Payne-Speaks
About ‘Facing
_ Jobless World’

“Facing the Jobless World" was
Prof. C. E. Payne’s subject when he
addressed the final senior chapel Fri.
day morning.

“I feel more like congratulating
you than pitying you for emerging
into such a tumultous and challeng—
ing world," Mr. Payne told the sen-
iors. “However, you face a most dis-
couraging prospect, The real test
will come when you return home and
the idle days seem to loom endlessly
ahead. This is your first test, and
you cannot afford to lose it.”

Mr. Payne used the struggles of
early Iowa. pioneers to illustrate his
message of encouragement. "History
has shown us that each generation
has had its cloud of despair; history
has shown us that each generation
emerged Victorious."

"If you want the good life you must
help create it,” he concluded, ”and
there are four rules you must follow
in doing so. They are: first, keep your
morale and show your metal; second,
keep busy'do it without pay if ne-
cessary, but do it; third, keep your
sense of humor and consequently
your sense of proportion; and fourth,
study modern questions, What the
present-day world needs most is con
structive thinking

inaugurated this spring. Reports
were that the suits would be one-
piece and green in color, constructed
on the same “floor plan" as those
worn by women majoring in physical

Steiner Plays
Give Current

Life Phases

Originals by Ewoldt, Lamb,
Birdsall Also Scheduled

for Commencement

By Lillie Hagen

Three current phases of American
lifeione sectional, one racial, and
one nauonalﬁwere deeply impressed
upon those students who witnessed
the preview of the three original one~
act commencement plays presented in
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium
Thursday night by members of the
production classes.

These plays, written by Wynona
Ewoldt, Clifton Lamb, and Maurice
Bird‘sall, are in competition for the
Henry York Steiner Memorial prize
in playwriting, and will be given
again June a.

Modern Life

,rIl: is gratifying to realize that
Crinncll playwrights have choscn sub—
ject material from actual presentrday
conditions, for it tends to disprove
the prevalent impression that college
students concern themselves more
with theory than facts. Arid despite
a slight roughness in Thursday
night’s production, and the tendency
to be too much drawn out in spots,
the audience was genuinely surprised
and pleased by the plays.

Clifton Lamc, wno is taking grad—
uate work here in drama, has inject-
ed a greater depth of feeling into
"Shades of Cottonlips" than is to be
found in the rival productions. Mr.
Lamb gave one of the finest perform-
ances of the evening in the role of
“the form", followed closely in merit
by the characterizations of James
Coddington and Jean Lovell as the
serious Ncgro playwright and his
flippant wife.

noilicking Farce

"Prosperity —— a Pseudo-Morality
play,” by Maurice Birdsall was not
all its title conveyed, It turned out
to be a rollicking farce with audience
appeal oozing forth with nearly every
line. The “Demubllcan,” that
strange animal which has aroused so
much curiosity since Mr. Birdsall
coined the term, turned out to be
Louise Goodwin and Helen Blake,
disguised by a blanket into the con-
tours of an elephant with the head
of a donkey. The synchronized move
ments of "Demublican" got the
most laughs of the evening, until A.
Dcprcssion, in the form of Robert
Polachek plus a pair of most wicked
black moiistachios, aligbted from the
cart drawn by “Demmy.”

The leading character, “Prosper-
ity,” was expertly played by Wyn-
ona Ewoldt as a foil to the sinister
motives of “A. Depression," and as a
complement to her elusive mate,
“Confidence," enacted by Richard
Kuncl.

from the National Broadcasting cam-

Here the musicians live in constant
association, frequently appearing
publicly in their own concert hall,
and spending their spare time, if any,
in outdoor recreation, individual prac-
tice, and teaching.

The advance notice continues: “All
members of a string quartet must
work for the common purpose. There
can be no vanity, no attempt at self-
display in such an undertaking. The
moment one member of the group

Conard Says

Test System
Well Proved

Explains New Examination
Plan for Future

Explained

"The result of the new system of
comprehensive examinations will be
that a. degree from Grinnell will
mean a lot more,” declared Henry s,
Conard, professor of botany, in his
talk explaining the reading period,
in chapel, Thursday.

Professor Conard said that a col-
lege degree does not mean anything
unless the student really works for
it; comprehensive examinations, he
believes, will render it necessary for
Grinnell undergraduates to do con-
siderable work in preparation for
them, and should, therefore, prove
worthwhile.

Should Exercise Outdoors

The reading period, as explained
by the speaker, has been established
because the faculty committee feels
that students should have ample
time to prepare for their examina-
tions, while freed from the exactions
of daily class work. He repeated his
statement made in a chapel speech
last January, that students should
devote a couple of hours a day, dur-
ing this period of preparation, to ex-
ercise in the open air.

Professor Conard declared that
past examinations here have been so
easy that Grinncll graduates going
on to advanced work, have labored
under a handicap. He believes that
the comprehensive system will do
away with this difficulty. in part.

Includes Sample of Course

Mr, Conard pointed out the in-
creasing use of examinations for all
promotions. "The objective of the
new type test has encouraged this
increase because it permits a. very
extensive sampling of the candidate’s
knowledge and thought-power," he
explained.

The comprehensive test, according
to the speaker. is one which in-
cludes all the material of a course
or a period of study, and as large a
sample as possible. ”Final compre-
hensive examinations in the major
field," he said, “have been made a re-

to D. F. Bradley

Another dedication in addition to
that of the Luella .1, Read Cottage
Will he held at commencement time,
it has been announced. Monday, June

pin oaks located on the central

Bradley who was president of Crin—
nell college’for three years, from
1902,1905.

istration, most of the trees in the
central campus were planted and the
library and Herrick chapel were con-
structed.

Congregational church in Cleveland,
Ohio. He is still serving in that car

Dr. and Mrs, Bradley have been
