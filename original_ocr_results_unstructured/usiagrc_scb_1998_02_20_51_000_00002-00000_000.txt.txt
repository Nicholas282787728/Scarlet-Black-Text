ers when the wire breaks.

GardnerAndcrson also identrfiesthe
triangular (not heart-shaped?) object
asadeviceusedtosplicewlreonacom

. planter and also to plant com cross-
wise as well as lengthwise.

Leonard StecherofKellogghas used
that triangular object many times, he
says, to splice corn planter wire to

- gether when planting With horses. it
also checked the planter so you could
plant both ways. He used to plant lots
ofcom that way, he says.

And Marvin Billman who farms
southeast ofGrinnell says he‘s prob-
ably used up at least three dozen ofthe
little objects and, in fact. used to carry

- that many around with him when he
was planting, just in case.

Howard Quillin, a 94-yearrold ex-
pert on such matters from New Sharon,
also identiﬁes the corn planter wire
splicer with the news that he, too. still
has some.

Another with the same response is
Leo Sehott of Brooklyn who names it
a splicer for planter wire.

Robert Gauley begs to differ, saying
thatthelrtile wire object is a fastencrio
hold seat covers in place in early Ve~
hicles, maybe the late I920: when seat
coverswere not fastencddown buthad
to be held in place by these little trian-
gular objects.

A humorous response, on the other .

hand, comes from Around’s long-time
friend, the anonymous OLE COUN-
TRY BOY, who felt moved to add his
2 cents worth: “Looks like a hog ring,
but in these days it could be used for it
people ring."

As the weight of eVIdence favors
Mintle’s description of the M0 as a
wire splicer fora corn planter, Around

will have to vote in his favor.

Some ofthese folks also had words
of wisdom about the tubular Mystery
Obieet submitted by Giles Kline.

Back Again:
Tubular Mystery Object

Strovers recalls it as a dust cap for a
tire and Gardner Anderson kiiows it as
a valve Stern on a tire tube. His rs
aluminum, hesays,buthe’snotsurc he
can lay his hand on it.Marvin Billmali
thinks it came off the tire of a I926
Essex. And Robert Gaulcy is right on
with this one, calling it a valve stem
cover, probably for an old Buick or
Studebaker like the ones his father
drove. Those older vehicles came wtth
wooden wheels and spokes and tires
lined by inner tubes which had valves
about 3" long protected by these curi-
ous threaded tubes wrth rough sides,
making them easier to grip when rc-
moving or replacing.

Giles Kline, in the meantime, has
glimpsed another one like his while
checking out exhibits at an antique
auto display in Des Moines, making
his Seem even more valuable to him,
