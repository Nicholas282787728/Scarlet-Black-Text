THE MEN'S RECEPTION
The iniomial reception given to
the new men students of the insti-
tution in the Society Halls Friday
evening was the most successful

‘function of such a nature that has

been given in recent years. All
of the nziv men and a greater part
oithe oldclassnien took advantage
of the occasion to get acquainted

lwllh their fellow students.

The affair was very informal,
everyone present being a member
of the social committee, and thus
the new men were made to feel
right at home.

W. F. Hunting welcomed the
new men in behalf oi the students.
after which Dean Main, Professor
Fink. Principal Horn and Piesir
tient Bradley gave short talks tor
the faculty. All received
with enthusiasm. and it was very
noticeable that the new fellows all
seemed to be imbued with the old
Grinncll Spirit.

Apples and grapes were placed
in different parts of the halls, and
atter everyone had been generous»

were

.ly served. the gathering broke up,

each one ieehng that a successtui
year had bccn opened to him.
