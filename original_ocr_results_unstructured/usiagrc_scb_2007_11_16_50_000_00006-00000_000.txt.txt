Campus helps
with media

3v ABBY RAPOPORT

According to T/Je Nil/i011, Muriel GallerCl-lasanoff’IO ini’
tially disliked all the attention surrounding her central role in
the discovery that the Clinton Campaign had planted ques-
tions at an event in Newton. She told the magazine that all
the attention cieatcd an “awful experience” and that she wanted
”nothing else to do with in" only three days later, CNN broads
cast a televised interview with GallorChasanoff

This shift in media relations came after Gallo-Chasanoff
began working wirh l<ate Worstcr, director orCom municarion,
While students seldom need the help, Grinnell has multiple
policies and resources to help students in dealing with the me
dia, potentially making media relations more manageable.

“We probably received seveial dozen phone calls or emails
from media organizations,” said worster, ”who thought we
could either get them access to the student or help them get
access to the student,"

Media can easily gain access to students by calling the
Grinnell switchboard. While switchboard operators do not
give out phone numbers, they will connect callers to students'
rooms. According to Mark Miller, deputy director ofInformar
tion Technology Planning and Business Operations, students
can have their numbers blocked, biit this will affect all calls, not
just undesirable ones. “We can’t do it selectively,"said Miller.

Even if a number is blocked by switchboard, students'
phone numbers are accessible through the online directory of
campusrnetworked computers. Student Affairs will only block
such numbers ifa student is being hamssed.

Because it is so simple to contact students, administrators
recommend that students dealing with media requests seek help
from College and Alumni Relations,where Worster is located.

"It takes a lot of pressure off our students," said Jennifer
Krohn, dean for Student Life.

Worster worked closely with GallorChasanoff, who der
clined to be interviewed for this story She and others in her
ofﬁce took messages from the media and worked with Gallo-
Chasanoff to decide whether or not to do an interview and
which one to do.

“I did spend a signiﬁcant amount oftimc with Muriel," said
Worster, “but as I told her, I would give her the good, the bad
and the ugly with all ofher options."

Worster emphasized that her goal is not to make decisions
for students but rather to offer the resources necessary for an
informed decision. “lfa student wanted to do a television ins
terview,1 would help that student be able to ask the questions
that are relevant," she said.

Regardless ofwhether a student works with the communir
cations specialists at Grinnell, the department ofCollege and
Alumni Relations expects to be notified of any media on Cam-
pus, and wants students ro be aware that no member of the
media may enter the residence halls.

“That’s a really private space,"said Krahn, “Once they're in
that space, it's very hard to get them out."

Krohn and Worstct also emphasize that students do not
need to cooperate with the media at all.

“The first thing students need to know is that it is their
choice," said Worster. “Just because the media calls you does not
mean you have to ﬁnish the callYou have the choice."

John Edwards
to visit campus

Candidate to speak in Harris on
Tuesday, Nov. 20 at 12:15 pm.

Two weeks after New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson was the first
presidential candidate to visit campus this semester, former Senator john
Edwards will be campaigning in the Harris center this Tuesday

Edwards,who will be accompanied by prominent musicians and actin
ists Jackson Browne and Bonnie Rain, is currently in third place in most
Iowa polls. Edwards is basing his entire campaign on a strong perfonnance
in the Iowa caucuses, and has built a strong organization in the state. Even ,
though Edwards is trailing right now, longtime Foweshiek County Demr
ocratic leader Don Smith, History, thinks that Edwards figures to be a
major factor on caucus night.

“My belief is that Edwards will be viable about everywhere,” Smith
said. “My impression is that John has worked the rural precincts every-
where, and I can’t think of any of the Grinnell wards where he would not

be viable,"

In the past several weeks Edwards has been relentlessly criticizing
frontvrunning New York Senator Hillary Clinton.

Among other- issues, Edwards can be expected to use his visit to
Grinncll College to attack Clinton either explicitly or implicitly for her

campaigns planted question with a Grinneil College student ara Newton
event two weeks ago (see “Grinnell student sparks media frenzy," page 1).

Media Frenzy
from p. 1 political insiders that most camr

paigns plant questions occasion-
ally, the candidates insisted that their campaigns did not plant
questions.

At a campaign stop on Monday in New Hampshire, BaraCk
Obama said planting is “not a practice we’ve ever engaged in,
and it's not a practice we plan to engage in."

It was John Edwards who most vigorously attacked Clinton
on the issue. “People expect you to stand in front of them and
answer their hard questions, And they expect it to be an honest
process," said Edwards. “What George Bush does is plant ques-
tions, and exclude people from the events. And I don’t think
that is what Democrats want to see in Iowa"

The Edwards campaign even unveiled an attack website,
wwwplnntsrorhillarycotn, highlighting the incident.

Iowa political commentator Chase Martyn ’07 said “in it-
self," planting is “a fairly benign process" and that Clinton's was
“not the first campaign that has done it in Iowa.”While he had
not heard of other campaigns this year planting questions, he
said he thought “the handrwringing [by other candidates] may
have been a little excessive."

Following the seals article, Gaﬂo-Chasanoff gave an in-
terview with CNN in which she gave more details about the
Clinton campaign's methods. She described a staffer who ap
proached her with a binder containing a list of questions, iii-
cliiding one for a “college student" that was given to her

When called for a comment on Thursday, Mark Daley,
Clinton’s Iowa Communications director, said that the mm,
paign had addressed the claims throughout the week and der
clincd further comment on the planting controversy.

Creation ofa media frenzy

Ar 2 pm. on Friday, Nov. 9, the scars original article was
placed online. Within five hours, it had gone from a tiny college
newspaper to a national cable news network. The process high-
lights the murky ways in which politics and media interact.

One of the first commentators to discover the story was
Martyn. who posted about it on his blog around 4:25 pm.
Shortly after that, he said he was contacted by supporters of
rival campaigns tipping him off to the story.

it is a fairly standard practiee for political operatives to send
not-for-attribution tips to reporters for stories that reﬂect well
on their candidate or poorly on a rival candidate. These tips
were what brought the st’B's article to the attention of the
national media.

Fox News reporter Major Garrett received tips from rival
campaigns early Friday evening. He said that he and his team
immediately placed a request for comment to Clinton and her
gan searching for footage of the event, At around 6:40 pm.
CST, Garrett broadcast the report of Gallo-Chasanoft‘s story
on Fox News. By 8 pm, the Clinton campaign had eonfirmed
that the planting incident had occurred and Garrett announced
the campaign's statement live on “Hannity and Colmes,"

The next morning the article appeared on the Drudge Ree
port, and would continue to build in intensity for several days.

Martyn and Garrett both said that the story made national
news because it fit inro the Clinton campaign narrative “The
story alone won't make a huge difference [in the campaign,"
Martyn said. “Its impact will be in how it plays into the larger
narrative. Senator Clinton has taken very few questions around
Iowa and caucus-goers are beginning to notice."

 

Obama saves us from ourselves, rivals Strauber

CaucuSrgoing Democrats have an extraordinary responsir
bility to bear in rhe upcoming election. After seven years ofone
of the most divisive administrations in our nation's histoiy, we
have the opportunity to nominate a leader who may likely (but
not certainly!) become our next president. We have the respon»
sibility to choose a nominee who will be capable ofuniring our
torn Country, bringing Democrats, Republicans and Indepem
dents together as Americans. That nominee must also be able
to run against the likes ofRudy Giuliani and Mitt Romneyand
be able to claim votes from outside of the Democratic Party to
ensure victory.

Now is the time to look to the future, not to the past, to
find solutions. Rather than reliving the culture wars and trir
angularion of the ’90s, let’s create a new future that will renew
the Democrats lost standing as the progressive party for the
people. Caucus goers must select a candidate with a history of

working across party lines, who knows that theie is not even a
chance fol progress if you don’t sit down with the other side.
Let’s have a real discussion ofwhy progressive ideas are better,
not a shouting match,

We can, however,1earn from the past. Democrats must stop
parting themselves on the back and should stop assuming. This
election is not a guarantee. We owe it to ourselves to take a step
back, remember what happened in 2000 and 2004, and choose
a candidate that is nonepolarizing and running for president for
the right reasonsito fight for the American people. We must
brush aside our skepticism and apathy to unite in this goal or
we can count on another election of dumbfounderinent, ask-
ing ourselves what the hell happened and preparing to salute
President Giuliani.

It is for this reason that I will be caiicusing for Barack
Obama in Grinnell on January 3rd. Senator Obama offers a

proven ability to cross party lines (check out l'cpublltﬂllsfnrn-
baina.org) and has shown himself as a candidate for America,
not just for the Democratic Party. As he invoked the spirit of
Dr. King at the J] Dinner Friday night in Des Monies, stressing
the “fieice uigency of now,“he embodied the revolution that he
stands for. Be sure to watch his speech online.

As a former professor of constitutional law at the Uutvets
sity ofChicngo, he has an analytical skill that only Ira Strauber
could best, proving this with his nearrperfect prediction of the
outcome of the war in 2002, and he remains the only major
candidate who did not vote to authorize the war.

For me, the choice is clear, The best candidate to offer the
possibility of tearing down the divides between Republicans
and Democrats and restoring confidence in our country again
is Barack Obama.
