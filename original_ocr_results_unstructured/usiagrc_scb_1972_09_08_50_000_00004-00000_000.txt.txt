Post-Natal Care:
A Campus Concern?

President Leggett, in his- call for a rekindling of the soul-
searching process which‘ the college has been going through
for some time, has brought out many aspects of life here which
are essential to a complete appraisal of the Grinnell educa—
tion. Most of these have been under question and undergoing
change for several years-»the grading system, the idea ofa
‘balance” between divisions in a liberal arts education, the
use and abuse of independents, the four year residency re-
quirement.

However, one of Leggett’s eight areas of study, career
counseling for graduates, is a fairly new concern, and one
that has not been the subject of campus-wide debate the way
many of the others have. Hopefully this will not prevent its
ention as the other areas, for it is through a thorough coun»
seling system that the college can hope to unite its own in-
terests with those of the community which surrounds it.

Grinnell has long had the luxury of being able to stop worry-
ing about its students upon graduation. With high levels of
entrance into graduate schools and active career-recruits
ment by businesses and industries here on the campus itself
the College could maintain a passive interest in wpat hap—
pened to its graduates and was never forced into an active
role. It cared, but never really needed to translate that con—
cern into dfeinite activity. Soaring graduate school standards
of admission and a shrinking job market have changed all
that.

Added to this decliningpower of a B.A. degree, which faces
all college graduates at the present time, are special problems
which the situation at Grinnell in particular forces its gradu—
ates to face, and which the College as awhole must begin
taking some responsmlllty in helping to answer. The campus
and the ‘real world’ have always been seen as two sharply
different entities, but after graduation, one simply was
expected to move from one to the other, with very little
thought or question. But now, with the ‘real world’ no longer
welcoming Grinneliians with open arms, the College must
begin taking steps to attempt to connect the two.

This rejection, this separation of life ’on the campus from
anything else, is a two-way street, coming not only from
outside but from within individual students as well. Par-
ticularly on this sort of a campus, small, somewhat isolated
form the community in which it is located and easily cut
off from major events, the atmosphere of a social and in-
tellectual womb pervades, totally comfortable for many, and
extremely painful from which to break out One finds last
year’s and previous years’ seniors returning every fall,
many of them unsure as to where they are going, attempting
to prevent the inevitable severing of the umbilical cord.

Many of Leggett’s areas of study are designed to make
Grinnell a better place, both academically and socially,
as rightly they should, but may also serve to only increase
one’s desire to remain here. Thus the College must also
take some responsibility not to envelop its students so
completely that they feel unable to cut off enough ties with
the institution to begin an independent existence.

The examination and hopefully the increase of career coune
seling services could serve as a sign of Grinnell’s affir»
mation of an active concern for its graduates and the beginning
of another, broader line of questioning: How much respon-
sibilty should a four—year institution, once it- has determined
its educational objectives and attempted to implement these
through a combination of many factors, feel toward the adaptae
tion of its graduates to life outside its Walls? How can the
College provide the sort of intellectual nurtures which will
at once live up to the standards and definition demanded bv
the words ‘liberal arts" and still not alienate its students from
the non-intellectualism of the world beyond? After making
incubation the most pleasant possible time, can it prevent the

awful shock at birth?

Recently the She reported my

resignation as Student Coordinator
and the resignation of Loren Hart
as Student Auditor, but it incorrectly
stated that Loren had not notified
SGA, He had done so in :i letter
to Russ MCGregor which was never
forwarded. As tor myself, I would
like to explain my decision and
share some personal perspectives
on the Student Coordinator’s Office

My decision to return to Grinnell
is somewhat ironic given the belief
I once held that I had reached the
point of diminishing returns on my
investment of time and money at
Grinnell Grinnell offers excellent
academic opportunities and an en-
vironment conducive to productive,
if painful, soul searching. However,
at some point all nonpremeds be-
come skeptical of the value and
"relevance” of Studying liberal
arts; too, one can only search one’s
soul so long before the process
erodes into one of destructive mass
ochism in which one is left with
only shreds of self confidence.

The opportunity to skip a fourth
year at Grinnell and begin career
studies at Columbia Law School
was attractive. Momentum alone
could easily have carried me into
Columbia, but after careful consid-
eration of my own needs and abil—
ities, I decided that at this particr
ular time my interests would best
be served by another year at Grins
nell.

In order to make the decision to
turn down Columbia a wise one,
I also felt it necessary to resign
as Student Coordinator. Only in that
way can i make the best possible
use of my remaining opportunities
at Grinnell.

The exact nature of the Student
Coordinator's job has always been
difficult to explain. Different coor-
dinators have pronded differ
ent services as the particular perr
sonalities and differing structures
of SGA have dictated. Greg Vrani—
car brought attention to the office
two years ago when he served as
a combination JohnMitchell~Henry
Kissinger figure to then SGA Pres—
ident Andy Loewi. Last year the
office retained its notoriety and exe
panded its functions under the
dynamic leadership ob Bob Meyer.

This year, with the substitution
of two active SGA Vice-Presidents
for the virtually nonefunctioning C
and? and AWS Presidents, the role
of the Student Coordinator’s Offlce
will be somewhat more narrowly
circumscribed than in past years
when the distinction between SGA
and the Student Coordinator's office
was not clear cut.

constitutionally, the Student Coors
dinator is a free agent- he is to
oversee the vast committeestruc»
ture, he is to serve as a checking
agent on SGA, and he is to inves-
tigate any and every complaint, Un-
officially, he is to be a campus
“ombudsman". On paper, the 531-,
viccs sound quite valuable, but in
fact, some of these tasks are in—
surmountable and others are uni
necessary.

Last year the Coordinator's office
attempted unsuccessfully-and
eventually abandoned the time con»

To the Editors:

In1970 CongressmanFredSchwen-

votes. With redistricting, Scli~
wengel's 1st District in Southeast
lowa now includes Bentonand Power
shiek counties and 22,800 newly ens
franchised college students. Since
the number of new young voters
exceeds Schwengel's 1970 Victory
margin so greatly, and since Sch»
wengel is generally accorded to be
a conservative, clearly lie is lacing
a tough fight.

Not unnaturally Schwengel’s came

Frequently, committees were found

a need to pare down the number of

an ad hoc basis. The effect of such
streamlining would be to makecom-
mlttees more directly responsible

for a committee coordinator,

handling thesecomplaints,theCoor-
dinator’s Office is setting itself up,
as it has in the past, as an advo—

There is no question that students
need a strong voice to speak for
them as their interests clash with
the vested interests of the faculty
and the Administration in dealing
with campus wide issues. That isthe

the two SGA VicerPresidents are,
in effect, coordinators for SGA. But

Supplement

The Scarlet and Black will pub-
lish the first of three planned
literary supplements on Friday,
September 29. Members of the
college community have in the
past taken advantage of the op
porflinity to submit their poems,
short stories, essays, and ac»
companying illustrations for
publication, often for the first
time.

The SiitB encourages all stu'
dents, faculty, and staff to take
advantage of this opportunity to
see their own work in print,
Material should be in to us by
Sunday, September 24.

which can and should be performed
by any of severalgroups: the Deans
of Students, the Resident Advisers,
the Student Advisers, and the House
Presidents

The performance of these duties
by the Student Coordinator’s office
has the potential for excusing the
Deans, RA's and SA's from their
responsibilities and forundercuttng
their credibility and usefulness. If
the burden of processing student
complaints and suggestions was
shifted from the Student Coors
dinator‘s Office to House Presidents
and Student Advisers, then perhaps
student government itself would be
a more unified and responsive in-
stitution,

These thoughts are meant simply
to raise questions about the Student
Coordinator’s Office are in no way
meant to demean the already cone
siderable efforts of my friend and
successor Craig Kugisaki, Butfrom
personal experience i know that the
price of sacrifice forbeinga student
government leader—-the partialloss
of one’s academic and personal self

not be paid unnecessarily.

Defend ISPIRG

fore rely upon the stated aims of
the organization, contacts with its
members, and our perceptions of
the structure and potential ofISPIRG
in making our reply.

The notion of“enlightened” subur-
ban students altruistically picking
up the plight of the “uninformed”
rural Iowans is ludicrous. Theaims
of the organization demand that
ISPIRG work within the communi-
ties to gather preliminary infor-
mation, deﬁne priorities, and con-
duct research.

Within the next month public hears
ings will be held throughout the
state, including Grinnell, so that
we may become informed ofthe con-
cerns of Iowa citizens, Then we
can begin to make our contribution
as an academic community toward
the resolution of particular prob—
lems, Thus, lSPIRG hopes to be-
come a forum for grievances of
other lowans.

ISPIRG is conscious of the difiie
culties involved in establishing a
relationship between its staffandthe
Students. At the state meeting last
weekend we discussed our intention
of retaining our role as directors
of the organization, calling on our
staff for suggestions and resources
and not for leadership. The staff
itself is committed to acting within
a student controlled organization.
Whether students will retain their
control is dependent upon our ins
itintive and exercise or power. only
if we fail to acceptour responsibili-
ties will our potential power fail to
be actualized.

This brings us to the final point--
the degree of student commitment
to ISPIRG, We are Working on the
assumption that Grinnell students
are concerned enough to follow
through with their ideologies and
not merely Jumpiromcauseto cause
according to the political whims of
the Spring, Perhaps with the addi—
tional gratuities of classroom
credit, or a student internship pro—
gram, interest will be catalyzed.
Since the ISPIRG staff, contacts,
and media can be made accessible
for any student research project,
this may mollify the concern about
commitment
