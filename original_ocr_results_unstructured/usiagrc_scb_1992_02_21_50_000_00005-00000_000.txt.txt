More sensitivity needed for elderly

By Alison Wade

Last Sunday, a resident at the
Friendship Manor Nursing Home
smiled contentedly as she held the
hand of a Grinnell College student
and listened to stories of life on cam-
pus. This resident, like others at vari
ous local nursing homes, recieved the

' opportunity to meet with a student as
a result of the Nursing Home Visitar
tions sponsored by Mortar Board.

This visitation program provides

‘ weekly student transportation to the
Friendship Manorand the St. Francis
nursing homes so that students may
sit for an hour and chat with the old
erly residents. The visits last only one
hour. and they are scheduled during
the time slot generally agreed to be
the least busy at Grinnellw immedi-
ately prior to and immediately fol-
lowing dinner.

Despite the low time commitment
and apparent convenience of sched-
uling,frusuationsaremounting. Pro-
gram coordinators report that there
are rarely more than two volunteers
per Visit, and someweeks there are no
volunteers at all.

“That’s really the most frustrating
part of the program,” said coordinar
tor for the St. Francis visits, Shaan
Hamilton. ‘The ﬁrst week of this
semester, I was the only one who
showed up at all. The next week,
there were three of us. so I was
thrilled,” he stated.

Jenn Mattem. coordinator for the

Friendship Manor visits, shares this
frustration “I’d like to see just one
percentmoreoftheGrinnell commu~
nity get off their PC. butts and do
something...Lip service gets really
old on this campus,“ she said. “The
factis thatonacampus of 1200 people,
the average number of people who go
with me each week is two, I ﬁnd that
repulsive," she remarked.

Hamilton believes that “many
people are scared of going into a
nusing home. They’re afraid they'll
get depressed."

“But come on...’, remarked
Mattem, “these people live in that.
They‘re aware aware that people ﬁnd
their situation depressing, and that
makes them even more depressed.
And that‘s all the morereason thatthe
visits are appreciated. It‘s a reaffir-
maLion that people do care.”

Hamilton agrees that the visits are
appreciated.“Thcydefinitelyperkup.
The gratitude is deﬁnitely there," he
said.

One regular participant in the pro-
gram remarked that “Sure, it’s sad
when you walk in. Some weeks it’s
really hard to do. But there are occa-
sions when it’ s obvious that theirspir—
its have been lifted, just because they
got a chance to talk to someone dif-
ferent. And if nobody showed up at
all, then where would they be?”

According to Mattem, many stu-
dents show discomfort at the thought
of spending time with the elderly.
“And it’s a big handicap. this agist

frame of mind," she claimed.
“Younger people just freeze up, yet
these people in the nursing home are
just people. They’re just people
who’ve been around for a few more
years."

Mattem also feels that much of
this discomfort is based on fear.
“We’re going to be old, and that’s
what people are really saying when
they claim to not feel comfortable
with the elderly,” she stated. “What
theymean is, 'lcan’tdeal with the fact
thatthere’s achancethatl mightwind
up holed up in a nursing home, com-
pletely alone'."

Coordinators and program partici—
pants feel that although it may not
always be easy, there are tremendous
benefits to be gained from attending
the visits. Hamilton remarked, “You
get to establish a rapport, so you can
go back week after week and see the
same people. They look forward to it,
I look forward to i .Also, there’s so
much to learn from someone who’s
been through so many experiences.
There’s a lot. of wisdom therei”

“Of course it's not easy," said
Mattem. “Of course you’re going to
get depressed. But you make such a
difference, even if it is to just one
person. And in doing so, you become
fully human,” she stated.

Human sexuality and the church subject

of Thorson-Smith's presentation

By Karen Nutter

Sex. Controversy. Religion. So-
cial Justice. If the snow kept you
from attending Sylvia Thorson-
Smith’s February 9 video/discussion
presentation on “The Church Studies
Human Sexuality: What Happens
Next?," you missed quite an interest-
ing and enlightening evening of dis
cussion.

Sponsored by the Office of the
Chaplain, the program was centered
on the 1991 Presbyterian report on
human sexuality, issued last Febru-
ary to the Presbyterian General As-
sembly and the subject of much in-

1 tense debate within the church.
Thorson-Smith, Grinnell lecturer in
ReligiousStudicsandSociology,was

4 coauthor of this report, and so of-
fered many insights and personal re-

'ﬂections as she guided her audience

. of approximately 20 people through
the controversy surrounding “Keep-
ing Body and Soul Together: Sexual-

; ity, Spirituality, and Social Justice.”

Thorson-Smith began the evening

L with a brief history of this report and
her role in it. Appointed as one of the
17—member General Assembly Spe-
cialCommitteeroStudy Human Sexu-
ality, Thorson~Smith worked from
1988 until 1991 composing this re;
port, which focuses on perceived
sexual injustices within the Church
and society in general. Designed to
harmonize Biblical Scripture with
justice and human sexuality, the re-

portcallsfor‘justice-love”and“right-
relatedness." and makes 48
reccommendations to the General
Assembly concenring such issues as
gender relations, marriage and single-
ness, homosexuality, persons with
disabilities,clergysexualmisconduct,
adolescents and sex education, repro-
ductive technology, and AIDS,

Within a 58rpage framework, the
Committeeseeks toaffrrm the “good
ness”of sexuality, and warns against
the tendency of some people to view
turning towards God as necessarily
turning away from sex. Advocating
“an ethic of common decency,” rather
than the rigid “no sex before mar—
riage," the report calls for “mutual
respect, genuine care, ﬁdelity and ac-
countability" between partners, rer
gardless of theirmaritalstatus orgen»
der. It is this “justice-love” which is
committed to the integrity of every
person, and it is this kind of love
which represents sexuality in its best
form

The sexual pain present in society
today played a strong role in the for-
mulation of this repon, Thorsom
Smith stated. Whether it is the pain
feltby a homosexist in a discriminat-
ing, heterosexual world, or the pain
felt by a woman trapped in a violent
marriage, the report views sexual op»
pression as being very real and present
in our society. Suggestions within the
report on how the Church can ﬁght
this pain include the presently- for-
bidden ordination of gays and lesbi-

ans, homosexual Covenantal Com-
mitment Ceremonies, and support for
sexually-abusedorAIDS infected per-
sons.

Presentation of this report to the
203rd Presbyterian General Assemr
bly generated much controversy,
While special reports such as these
are normally distribuated only to the
600 members of the General Assem-
bly (composed of300 clergy and 300
lay members), with a couple hundred
more copies usually sold to interested
members of the Church, 60,000 cxtra
copies of this report were sold. A
“firestorm" of debate swept through
presbyteries across the nation, as
members received the report either
with fury orjoy.

The furorwithin theChurchcaught
the attention of the media, and was
featurcdin publicationssuch asPlay-
boy, (LS. Newsurrd WarldReporI and
The Des Moines Register, giving
Thorson-Smith what she jokingly
refered to as her “ 1 5 minutes of fame."

All this controversy centered pri-
marily on the report’s recommenda-
tions concerning homosexuality and
sex outside of marriage, culminated
last June in Baltimore, at the General
Assembly. While main priorities for
all participants in the Assembly were
“to keep the family together," and to
pray together despite their obvious
divisions, still conﬂict was evidentas
