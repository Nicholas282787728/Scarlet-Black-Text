Outside the Wall’

A confessed one-actjunkie reflects on THE-280's trip backstage

By Michael Andersen
Siaff Wrilet

lt's Monday evening, it month ago, A gaggle of lightly frenzied
college students mouth words to themselves as theysit sideways on the
green chairs in Burling First and hunch over stapled packets of photo-
copies. occasio ally onc dashes over to the reserve desk and is Just a
litile too btusquei “Um, P474, 78. 71, or 69." Rewarded with two
appropriate pamphlets, the student hurries back under a lamp.

Auditions are Tuesday and callbacks are Wednesday. Eleven
shows will be cast by early Thursday morning. Nervous actors and
more nervous directors chatter through Bucksbaum for 48 hours in
a flurry ofschcduling and selecting.

Then it‘s into rehearsals. About tworthirds of the campus nor
tices the mysterious disappearance of at least one acquaintance.
Landing a time slot in the Wall Theater is suddenly harder than
getting a Depot reservation on parents weekend.

By tech week, a bewildering rainbow of gafrtape has crawled its
way over the Wall floor, About one in 20 Grinnellians is looking
significantly more wild-eyed than usual. And of course there are
the inevitable conﬂicts with other end-of-semester shows, dances,
and, oh yeah, hnals.

It's hard to skirt hagiography when you’re
dealing with theatre at in very best. I think
Grinnell’s annual studentrdirected oneract fes»
tival, opented by Professor chris Connolly's
directingclass, is pretty much rhecmbodiment
of all that’s right about college drama—brev-
in, variety. experimentation. occasional rottenv
ncss, directorial license, acting opportunity, and
technical chaos. This weekend’s shows (which
vvill run opposite but not against the parallel Dance Troupe activity
and Harriette Pierce’s RAW) will play to full houses for a good
reason: they’re lots and lots of fun.

The first quintet, Bill A, played last night at 7.p.m. and goes up
prc-Waltz Saturday at the same time. it rncludc'st

“Three Sisters \X'hoAre not Sisters,"a bewildering Gertrude Stein
piece thatsports some ounlityaeringilookforMary LauraCallioun‘s
well-placed jazz hands) and a lot or(appropriate) caricature. Audi»
ences and reviewers might not be Conﬁdent as to what the plays
trying to accomplish, but it's comforting that the actors and direc-
torTrina Bugaj seem to be moving in a definite direction through a
text that might be about the absurdities of performance art.

"Chalky White Substance,” a Tennessee Williams play set in a
fat-future desert in which a man dressed in a long plain robe sol-
emnly gives advice to a young man named "Luke." Uncanny or
not, as an speculation on post—apocalyptic morality, it works fairly
well. Dave Nunez and Pet Janson play solitary. poor, nasty, brutish,
and shorelivcd lovers with dark confidence. Surprisingly enough,
Nui’iez doesn’t die at the end ofthis one.

“success," a humorous sketch by Arthur Kopit that meanders
into its message after a series of jokes that are sometimes clever and
sometimes startlingly predictable. At the climax, Fred Beukenia, a
disaffected writer on a book circuit, Informs the audience that inr
stead ofgoing to lectures (or, presumably, plays), they should stay
at home and fuck. The serious bits don't jive perfectly, but Beukema
and Emily Sahaki'an do some nice comedic work here.

“Linda Her," a picture by Harry Kondolcon of an unhappy
woman, her rclanonshrp with a friend, and the problems of grow.
ing up. Rachel Hailc and Meaghan Evans attempt to portray the
halfrtelepathy of close friends and usually succeed. Shannon
Hefferman is one ofthc weekend's three characters to capture the
gestures of the young.

“Rough forTheatre l," a Samuel Beckett dialogue between two

chair. beckett’s poetry is present and well-accounted for.

The second set, Bill 13, runs at 7 PM Friday and 2 PM Sunday:

“Almost Like Being" by Jeanelaude van ltallic. probably the
mostsnceessful ofthe 1 i simplybecausedirectoroonovan Sherman
throws the audience an extra wrench by adding a disconcerting laugh
track to an otherwise witty but straightforward piece. Jennifer Nelson
and John Catron capably lead a largish ensemble in a winking,
melocomic performance (partially financed by loans from a certain
Super Happy Endlng).

“Lonely," a rapid comedic diatribe against either domesticity or
selfrdceeprion or both. At ﬁrst it seems like Andrew Future-Henry's
and Sarah stayton's stunning rapport as a husband and wife will
dominate Robin Kimball's hands-indap underaeting, but an excel.
lent chaneter shift by stayton while FuersterHenry is offstage brings
Kimball into her own sisteriy familiarity,

“Misrcadingsi by Neena Bebet, a play about a college professor
and her student which links Drew Barrymore to Anna Karenina.
Morgan Witham as aVogue-conscious rich girl
and Caroline Ridley as a hermitish English
teacher are each unhappy in their own way.
sometimes the professors vulnerability raises
believability questions, but the text seems to
call for it, so in general all is well.

"What She Found There," an exploration
by John Glore of the paradox of innocence
through the window (mirror?) of Lewis
Carroll's A/ire work, Alicia Reid’s big-stage precision plays as well
here as Ned Axthelm’s $tudio»style understatement. Axthelm ac.
complishes the difrrculr task ofperforming a quietly matterrofcfacr
monologue without getting too angsty.

“Your Everyday Ghost story" by Lanford Wilson, another good
one. Jesse May roots his Lrur'sFi-re character for the mannerisms or
a neurotic gay New Yorker and comes up now with not only manic
humor but lowckey earnestness. Nicholas Wagner’s bravery in in»
terpreting his part against usual type pays off; thoughtfulness risks
making him simply the. er, straight man, but by doing it well he
both rescues his characters humanityand creates an effective rhythm
for the piece.

“This Property is Condemned,” thesecond Tennessee Williams
play ofthe evening. Sauniz Powell and Jose Medeiros play piece»
eious kids in what seems to be the rural south circa 1940 but could
be almost anywhere or anywhcn else. Powell‘s chanﬁtet holds a
banana and grapples with the big shoes ofa dead sister as Medeiros
holds a kite and gnpples with prepubesrent sexuality. The highest
point of the closing piece is probably the unexpected tremor in
Medeiros’s voice.

Bill B is both the strongerand the longerofthc two, clocking in

bills are remarkably fast, due to Connelly’s actual enforcement or
