Professor’s Future in
the Appeals Process

Students Oppose Recommendation to Deny Tenure

By Sharyn Obsatz

EVERAL students upset over
S the Executive Council’s rec

ommendation to deny tenure to
political science professor Keith
Fitzgeraldarc trying toweigh in on the
appeals process underway,

If the appeal fails and Fitzgerald
is denied tenure, he will no longer be
able to teach at Grinnell.

A professor denied tenure does
not get his or her teaching contract
renewedby Grinnell College nor have
the chance to try again for tenure. A
professor who is granted tenure has a
lifetime contract with the college.

‘0rdinarily,whatevcrrecommenr
dation theExecutivc Council makes is
followed,” Fitzgerald said.

Fitzgetald is appealing the rec—
ommendation through the Executive
Council. Appeals to the council can
only be made on the basis of new
information that wasn’t considered in
the process or allegations that proce-
dure wasn‘t followed properly.

The resultsof the appealmay not
be known until after gradtmtion this
May. Regardless of the final out-
come, Fitzgerald will be on sabbath
cal next year.

Senior political science majors
Laura Free and Megan Aukema be-
lieve the council's recommendation
failed to take into account the quality
of his Leaching, the amount of Lime
Fitzgerald spent with students and his
ability to relate to them both inside and
outside the classroom.

Aukema and Free. advisees of
Fitzgerald, think student input in the
tenure process was not representative
of student opinion and are organizing
a letter writing campaign to “show
there are students who are very con»
ccmed and think this is a wrong deci-
sion,“ said Aukema.

“Overall, I think it‘s a big misr
take for the department,” she said. “It
doesn’t seem like a reasonable deci-
sion."

Conﬁdentiality
Several groups participated in the
tenure decision, including the Execuv
Live Council, the Social Studies Divi-
sion Board, the Political Science
Department’s tenured faculty and the
Political Science Student Education
Policies Committee (SEPC), com-
posed ofpoliticalsciencemajors.(See

VOUNG CONSERVATIVE MEETS IDEOLOGICAL ICON: Grinnell junior Trevis Parson, pictured with William F.

Buckley Challenges Liberalism

Grinnell conservatives claim “equal time

By Jim Kropa &
A. Kambouroglou

PEAKING for about an hour
S to a packed Herrick Chapel

on Monday, William F.
Buckley, ir. criticized President Bill
Clinton‘s economic and tax policies,
proposed that drugs be legalized, and
spoke out against the condition of
illegititnacy in America.

Buckley's wry humor, patrician
bearing and erudite vocabulary con-
firmed that the world-renowned con»
servauve thinker’s reputation as one
oftlle tnostskllled public speakers in
America today IS well deserved.

in traditional conservative and
aristocratic fashion, Buckley was
skeptical of cffors to create a federal
program of frce health care, "Free
hclnth care, I‘d like to point out, is
health care for which somebody also
pays," Buckley quippca.

By no longcrplacing theetnpha-
sis on the individual, Buckley said,
President Clinton ignores the whole
purpose ofthe Federaliststructurc. It
would be better for states to ﬁnance
their own programs rather than hav-
ing the Federal government interr
vcne. according to Buckley.

“Money coming in from Wash-

ington is usually the same money you
just ﬁnished sending to Washington,
where, of course, money spends an
expensive night on the town,” he
explained,notingthatforeverySllO
sent to the federal government, only
$1 in beneﬁts is received.

Buckley blamed increasing lev-
elsofpoverty,illiteracy,crime,d.rugs
and uncmploymentonthe increasing
number of Singlcrpitrcnl families.
“The overriding problem of urban
centers." Buckley said, “are illegitir
tnatebirihs."chotedthatthcseprob-
lcms cxist despite trillions of dollars
in spending on social programs di»
rectly designed to solve them.

Receiving a question from the
audience about why he attributes
these social problems to singlerparr
ent families, he answered, “because
the statistics are absolutely unamr
biguous."

Buckley also criticized an other
one of Clinton’s proposals which
would disallowcompanies from con—
sidering as a business expense for tax
purposes executive compensation in
execes of one million dollars. He
stated thatexecutjvecompcnsation is
a business expense, and can not be
considered otherwise. ”Period. End
of argument. And ifyou disagrec, go
back to school. Releam the ABC’sof

’ in Herrick Chapel

logic, and be as careful at choosing a
school as Chelsea Clinton," Buckley
remarked.

Pointing out the high cost and
the low success of the war on drugs,
Buckley favored the legalisation of
drugs provided that their price would
not encourage a black market, and
thatsellingdrugstoaminorwouldbe
a capital offence. He also noted that
halfofall inmates today are in prison
for drug related offences, a greater
number than all the prisoners incar-
cerated in 1980.

Buckley’s honorarium was
$20,000 and the talk was sponsored
by the Grinnell College Republicans
through a grant from the Young
America‘s Foundation. Grinnell‘s
SGA contributedaboutSZ.OOO to the
total $23,000 cost to bring Buckley
here.

Grinnell College Republican
Trevis Parson was criticized because
no Grinnell students were able to ask
questions of Buckley in the Q&A
period following the speech, which
Parson conducted. Parson said that
the criticism was unfounded.

“if the Grinnell Collcgc com»
munity is going to bitch about this, i
think it’s absurd," Parson said, He
insisted that he did not receive any
