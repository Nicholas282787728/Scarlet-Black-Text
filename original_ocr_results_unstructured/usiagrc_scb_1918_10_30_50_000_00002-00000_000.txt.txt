With the prospects or several inter,

collegiate toothall cont sts, in the near

_flltul'e. it is proper that we shoiiid
give some met to inter-collegiate dtllv
letics as an important phase at Amery
can sports.

'In recent ars, there has licen eo
siderahle e eism on the part 02 la
ulty members of various institutions,
and on the part at educators over the
country. of the manner in which sports
are conducted in the average college
and university. And the very existv
ence or such ci ieisin, in a nicasni
shows that there is some Justification
for it.

The opponents of this form or sport
claim that athletes are usually
"bought" by an institution; that they
come to college tor the purpose of tak—
ing part in athletic contests and not
lor the purpose of studying. e d c ~~n
if an athlete is incln-eti to est ion

always a spirit or \vlilvﬂtvanyrm‘icc,
which in turn leads to cor iption andl
otten to very unspoi-tseoanliho condue l
h'oth on the part ot the players and or
the spectators. Consequently, the host
way to remedy these evils is to abolish
intercollegiate athletics entirely.

‘V On the other hand, there are those,
who believe that to abandon the com—l
petiiire side oi athletics, to destroy the
spirit ol rivalry, which an inter--
collegiate contest naturally generates, iSlmvll’ and aimlessly my Olin thoughts
