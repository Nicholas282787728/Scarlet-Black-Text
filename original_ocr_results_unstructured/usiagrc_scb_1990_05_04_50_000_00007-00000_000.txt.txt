Constructive Criticism for Kent Killion, Truesdell
"Clear the Air"

To the editor:

I would like to address a few
cominentstoMikeKent: Aftertwo
years of reading your articles, I feel
compelledtocritiqueyourmethods
of writing.

First of all. I have been disturbed
by the fact that you have made
minimal effort to understand why
the opposition says what it does.
Instead of providing thoughtful
argumentsandinsightfulcriticisms
based on knowledge, you present
arguments which belie ignorance
of the precepts and motivations of
lheolher side,such as theone-sidcd
portrayal of “Women Take Back
the Night" in the Des Moines
Register. Ileam nothingfrom such
a “View from the outside." and I
argue that tlte rest of the campus
does not either.

In fact, many individuals have
responded to your remarks With
varying degrees of Civility.
Unfortunately, you seem to have
read these letters as proof of your
rightness. You already possess a
framework by which you can
interpret these letters; that is, by
Slamming you, these individuals
are belying their knee»jerk liberal
tendencies. To a certain extent,
Mr. Kent, I agree. You masterfully
illu-strate the honey vs. vinegar
analogy atworkin usall. However.
I believe that another dynamic is
also at work, What if your
arguments are misinformed at
times? What ifyour argumean are
weak? Ithittkthatthe limits ofyour
own understanding have permitted

Magill Caught
Essence of
Closed—Minded
Campus Views

To the editor,

Jordan Magill’s column con-
coming the minority opinions on
campus has been the clearest and
fairest statement about this topic
that I've yet read. We DO ignore
the unpopular points of view; both
the initiatives and USSA proposal
areWaysofsilencingthedissenting
minority. Mr. Magill‘scomments
are those of a classically liberal
individual: he is allowing for all
opinionstohaveequal rights. While
this campus IS mainly liberal in its
political stances, there are few
people who actually live the liberal
ideal and are willing to safeguard
everyonc’s political affiliation.
Applause and gratitude to Mr.
Magill for reminding this campus
what we SHOULD be like.

you to miss the point rather
frequently.

I agree with you that
“conventional wisdom" often is
faulty and should be critiqued. It
is important to critically evaluate
for ourselves what we believe on
a given issue, but I believe that
critical evaluation implies know-
ing where your opposition comes
from. I feel that I can often learn a
lot from reading articles written
from a different perspective. lam
shownthewcaknessesofmystance
andamchallengcdtoseeksolutions
for those shortcomings. In fact, I
am given the opportunity to
strengthen my posnion by
incorporating the insights of other
viewpoints. Perhaps, Mr. Kent,
you could do the same.
Conventional wisdom and liberal
thought may very well possess
grains of truth. And one of
education’s central purposes is the
search for truth, is it not?

Therefore, I urge you to do better
research. I getconcemed sometimes
by the fact that you only seem to
read two or so articles on a given
topic, and those articles seem to
follow your natural inclination
(which is often one of your
crithisms of Grinnell’s liberals).
By limiting the exploration of a

topic, your articles often become
laced with the exaggerated words,
sweeping generalizations, and
smugness of an “instant expert"
someone who reads a few articles
and then feels well»versed on an
issuc(noletherecent“Enviropanic"
and “State of the World" articles).
Once again, i urge you to read
more and to challenge your own
preconceived notions by reading
progressive articles as well as
conservative. Be less concerned
about catching the author's bias
than understanding why they have
come to the conclusions they have.
Is it possible that they know
some ofthc issues more intimately
than you? Is it possmle that they
have some ideas which you should
consider'.7 Just challenge yourself
to understand where they are
coming rrom. Your brain will not
decay. I assure you, and your
arguments may well be enriched
by such work,

Lastly, part of the reason why I
am writing is because of my
personal sense of disappointment.
This campus would be wellrservcd
by a balanced column written by a
moderatceonservative. Iencoumge
you to go in this direction.

Compromise is solution
to Discussion and Peace

To the editor,

I came to Grinnell in order to
escape the closed—minded conscr»
vativcs of my hometown, thinking
that Grinnell was full of open
minded individualswhofeel freeto
express their varied views. Maybe
at one time Grinnell's campus ran
free. but that is not the case today.
This is a campus where the minds
are just as closed as in my home
town, but they are closed on the
other side of the spectrum.

Some of us, however, are not
leftists. Mike Kentisawell—known
conservative, and I admire his
courage to stand up and shout it
loud and clear. l-tow unfortunate,
however, that he, too, has a closed
mind and that he delights in the
arguments thatresult. l-low unforr
tunatc that anyone feels the need to
shout out a view, and to make it
extreme in order to be heard.

Idon'tknow exactly whereMike
Kent stands on any of the issues,
and I don’t Wish to read anything
into what he writes. Idon’twislt to
read anything into what anyone
writes. I cttn’t read minds. How-
ever,ilis clear thdtMikepresentsa
contrasting view, or else he
wouldn’t arouse controversy.

the other sides of the issues, we
may learn something — about our-
selves and about each other. No
one side is right. No one side is
wrong. Listen to each other. Get
the facts. Weigh them. Decide.

No, you can’t make all of the

To the editor,

We (Scott Tmesdell and Rob
Killion) have dcctdcd to write
jointly in the hope of clearing the
air about the March presidential
runoff. For the remainder of this
letterwe willspcakaboutourselves
in the third person.

Scott is not concerned about the
Election Board meeting remaining
conﬁdential,sowewillspcztkfreely
about his grievance.

The day after the presidential
runoff election, Scott filed a
grievance with Election Board. His
primaryconcem was thatoftheSOO
Orso votescast,lhere were lstewcr
names crossed off in the student
directory titan there were ballots
cast. Though small discrepancies
have been a normal occurrence in
past SGA elections (students msh
the voting table between classes,
people vote in rapid succession,
occasionally an election official
doesn’t get a name crossed out,
etc.), most SGA elections arcn't
decidedbytwelvevotes,eilher. The
purposeofScott'sgrievancewasto
ask that Election Board change its
traditional clccllon procedures in a
way that would make these
discrepancies less likely to occur.

After hearing Scott’s grievance,
ElectionBoardunanimouslyagrecd
that it would follow his advice and
improve the election process. In
fact,Elect'ton Boardismcelingncxt

week to accomplish that very task.

So,tosum up.Scotlneitherasked
for nor wanted a new election. No
one, certainly not Scott, believes
thatanythingimpropcroroutofthe
ordinary occurred during the
election. Scott simply asked
Election Board to improve us
election procedures. and they
agreed. The end.

Or so everyone thought until
Dianna Ward sent a letter to the
ScarletttmiB/ackthalallegedfraud
had occurred in the election and
implied Rob was in some way
responsible for problems wttli the
election. This is in no way the
opinion of Scott: at no tii-ne did he
ever blame Rob for any
lnadcquaciesin thootocu’on process,
At the same time, Rob’s comment
about Scott’s “unethical" behavior
in lllS letter last week was written
under the assumption that Dianna
was repeating things Scott had told
her. Rob. of course, wants to
withdraw that comment now that
he knows the truth about Dianna‘s
letter.

We both feel badly that Dianna’s
lettersetofftichain reaction ofhurt
feelings and angry letters.
Hopefully, themattcrcan now rest,
as it was before Dianna’s letter . and
everyone can move on with their
lives.

SGA President's Letter

Disillusions

To the editor.

Iam disillustoncd. After a year
inwhich hehasservedbrilliantlyas
SGA President, why has Rob
Killion suddenly Joined in a mud-
slinging war, where he can only
hurt himsell‘.7

As a freshman this year, i had no
say in Rob’s election last year.
However, throughout the year, I
have been constantly impressed by
his commitment, drive. and
creativcness. Iwas vcry upset,thcn,
tosce that inhisresponsetthanntt
Ward's letter, Rob wcntbcyond the
necessary defense of himself and
attacked an innocent, Scott
Truesdell.

l wtts actuttlly glad to see Rob's
lettci at first. Diannd'saccusations
were a hit farrfctchetl and unfair,
and needed to be answered. Rob's

effectively,

But then Rob went on to accuse
Scott, who had nothing to do with
Didnntt’s letter. of “unethical

Freshman

conduct" and of “telling anyone
who would listen how unfairly he
had been treated in the process.”
This, simply put, is untrue.

Scott is a close friend of mine,
He is my I-IAC. we have had classes
together, and have had many long
talks. Not once has he mentioned to
me the results ofthe election or the
discrepancy between the number
