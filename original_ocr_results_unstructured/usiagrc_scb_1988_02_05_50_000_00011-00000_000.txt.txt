wishes to be theatrical about it.
Anne Bradley '90 dropped six
seconds oll her loo-meter lreestyle
time tor a lifetime best. Heather
Lauver '90 swam the 165Drmeter
lreestyle lthat‘s as laps, tor those
who don't know) for the iirst time
and was pleased with her pet-tor
mance Jennie Robinson '90 swam
the same race, which she admits is
"psychologically‘hard." and drop-
ped her time 20 seconds from her
previous eitort.

I asked my teammates what the
memorable parts at the weekend

Strong

Effort

by Sports lnlormatlon otlice

In Wisconsin last weekend, the
Grinnell Pioneers dropped a pair
of decisio . but showed character
and positive play in several
phases Coach Jeff Westlund prais~
ed his team's effort on the road.
"We {ought our tails oil and played
hard to the end We had a chance to
win both games,” Westlund said,

Against St. Norbert. the
Pioneers were challenging when
turnover trouble bogged them
down. St Norbert, ahead by only
two at halltime. 33am. proceeded to
a 76-62 victory. Errant shooting
haunted the Pioneers who hit a
lrigid 34 percent compared with
the Green Knights 49 percent. 5..)
Jahn and Mike Spurbeck were
Grinnell’s offensive leaders with Is!
and ll points respectively.

In the following nlght against
Lawrence, the Pioneers refused to
be wiped out and finished only
seven points short. Ma . They
played the Vikings even alter a
32.25 halliime deilclt. “Against
Iawrence. I was impressed that,
for the ﬁrst time we sensed that
we could come lrom behind and
win. in the second hall we played
with conﬁdence, ran the break and
came within live points against a
good team." reported Westlund,

Grinnell's shooting warmed up
to 43 percent while Lawrence hit 45
percent. In double ligures in scars
mg were Jahn and Spurbeck with
ll points each and George Mes
.limsey with [0.

In the two games combined, the
Pioneers had a sdsz edge in re.
bounding. Jahn pulled down 17 re-
bounds on the trip and moved up to
iourlh in Midwest Conference with
a 7.9 average
