Honor System
is Favored
By Stevens

President Lists Three
Requirements Needed
For Success of Plan

"I am in favor or the honor sys-
tem, and 1 wish we had one hele,”
President Samuel N. Stevens said
Tuesday in reply to a recent
Scarlet and Black editorial which
requested that such a system he
tried in Grinncll.

If the honor system is to suc~
cecd, we must have three things,
Stevens said First, we must have
a student body who wants the
system hadly enough to enforce it,
In connection with this, there
would have to be an honor hoard
composed of students, and stu-
dents and faculty would have to
report known cases of dishonesty
to the hoard, Stevens stated.

Second, there should be a co-
operative relationship hetween
students and faculty which in-
volves primarily an act of faith
and trust on the part or both par-
ties, vaens continued.

Third, a method of educating
each incoming generation of
freshmen to value the honor sys-
tem must he worked out. Fresh»
men would he impressed with the
inevitahle discipline which fol-
lows an infringement or the sys-
tem, Stevens said.

Stevens emphasized the point
that an honor system is not made
by formulating a theoretical plan.
If the plan is to succeed, he de-
clared, a group of 50 students, 25
men and 25 women, must get to-
gether and state their helier in the
code of honor in the academic
system. These 50 students would
then name another 50 to aid
them, and {mm this point, if
enough pressure were brought to
hear on cheaters, the system
would grow until a new order
would eventually evolve.

There is but one thing which
keeps Grinnell from being a great
school, Stevens stated, and that is
the fact that the feeling of indiv-
iduality is too strong. If students
would realize that they should do
things for the group instead of
themselves, Grinnell would be one
of the finest schools in the coun-
try, Stevens seed,
