into the point column of the thir-
teent‘h annual nlinois Indoor Relay
Carnival here Saturday. Benny
Douglas and Howard Mcnrnth were
the ones who took medals back to
Grinneli, the former taking fourth in
the decathlnn with 4531 points, while
McIirath placed second in the 1500-
meters run. Henry Thomas failed to
qualify.

It was Barney Berlinger. sturdy
Pennsylvania star, who wrote defeat
on the tickets of the other all—around
entrants, taking his second succes—
sive championship with costly, points,
11% below the carnival record which
he established last year. , Everett Ut-
terback, colored Pittsburgh streak,
copped second with 5041 points, and
Bud Harper of Illinois took third with
489%-

Mcﬂrath Passes Two.

McIlrath got off to a poor start in
the 15DD-meters run and trailed in
fourth place for half the distance.
He opened his stride in the last two
laps and continued his pace, passing
up Fortune of Kansas and Brown of
Michigan state. The Grinneli run-
ner ﬁnished second to Putnam of
Iowa State. Putnam set a new
carnival record by winning in 4:004.

Douglas climaxed his ,long after-
noon’s performance in the all—around
by winning the half-mile run in
2:19.4, gaining 607 points in that
event. He ran a strong race the full
distance and easily pulled away from
Crain of DePauw and Harper of
Illinois, who ﬁnished second and
third, respectively

The remainder of Douglas points
were gathered by fourth places, with
the exception of a tie for third in the
high-jump. Berlinger won this
event and 1000 points by equalling
the all-around record of 6 feet, 1%
inches. utterback dropped out at 6
feet, taking second. while Douglas
tied with Holden of Crane for third.

which was won by Utterback. The
Grinneli athlete failed to count in the
ﬁnal. U-tterback repeated his win~
hing ways in the broad-jump with a
leap of 22 feet, 101/, inches, while
Douglas took another fourth, Ber-
iinger and Stearns, the latter from

“My principal work in Chicago dur—
ing spring vacation will be to help
Grinneli students establish contacts
and to give them any advice I can
rather than to 'get them jobs,‘ .. stat—
ed Milton Dreese, director of person-
nel, when questioned as to the pur-
pose of his visit to the Windy City
during the coming vacation period,
when he will be accompanied by a
number of Grinneli men and women
interested in obtaining jobs in Chic-
ago, in his visit to that city

“No one can get a job for you," he
declared. “You have to do that your-
self, but you can be greatly assisted
by being sent to the right people.
I will probably go to Chicago a few
days before spring vacation starts,
and will locate at some hotel for the
whole vacation. I will renew old
contacts and make new ones; and
will be available at all times to help
Grinneli men and women, who will
be in the city seeking positions."

Cap and Gown
Chooses Five

Teget, Urban, Cohen, Studier
and Carlson Are Elected

to Honor Group.

Cap and Gown, honorary organiza»
tion of senior and junior women who
have met the high requirements upon
which membership in the group is
based, elected five seniors to mem-
bership this week. They arc: Helen
Carlson, Aileen Cohen, Aloha Studier,
Fern Teget and Arline Urban. Jun-
ior members will be elected to the
group later in the spring. and initia-
tion of all the new members will be
held after junior elections.

Election to Cap and Gown is kept

strictly secret, and it was not until
the active members, entered the din-
ing room last night, clad in white and
took their places at the table, that
the women as a Whole knew that a
selected group of seniors were about
to be notified of their election to the
organization. Five vacant places at
the table signified the number of
women to he taken in, and during
the course of the dinner, a member
of Cap and Gown conducted each of
the pledges to their places at the
table, this procedure being the first
knowledge the five women had of
their election to the group.
Founded in 1915 on the same plan
as Mortar Board, Cap and Crown’s re~
quirements for membership include:
high scholarship, leadership, integrity
of character, service to the college
and personal inﬂuence. Active mem-
bers of the group include: Eva Ad-
ams, Katherine Gillespie, Blanche
Hulsebus, Doris McCornack, Miriam
McNaliy and Rebecca Conard.

Gale, Cox, Rose
Speak at Meeting
of Science Club

“The roof of the Alumni Recitation
hall is designed to support 191 tons
of snow,” said Mr. Grant 0. Gale, in—
structor in mathematics at a meeting
of the Grinneli college Science club
in Blair hall Monday evening. The
meeting was in charge of thc mathe—
matics department.

Mr. Gale spoke on mechanical
drawing, applying his discussion to
the construction of A. R. H. “The
corridor floors of A. R. H. are design—
ed to support eight pounds a square
foot, the classrooms sixty pounds,
and the auditorium one-hundred," he
said. “The sides will stand a wind
pressure of twenty pounds per square
foot."

Arthur Cox discussed the use of
probability in statistics, illustrating
the point by applying it to heads and
tails of coins, the probability of the
birth of girls and boys, and the prob-
ability of debate rates.

Harold Rose spoke on “brachcry—
stochrone," the path of the quickest
time, which is not a straight line,
but a curve, velocity being gained by
the momentum of going down the
curve.

Martha Hemphill, of the chemistry
department, was selected as the
Grinneli representative to attend the
Iowa Academy of Science at Ames
in May.

The April meeting of the science
club will be an open house in charge
of the psychology department.

 

GRINNELL. IOWA, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19, 1930.

'Dreese Will Spend Vacation in Chicago
Helping Grinnell Students Obtain Jobs

ing programs hirc men this early in
the year, Mr, Dreese declared. The
rest will tell job-seekers to come back
in June, when they will be doing
their hiring.

Mr. Dreese plans to get in touch
with Grinneli alumni, who are in
business in Chicago, as they are al—
ways interested in students from the
college, and, if they can’t hire them
themselves, they usually know of
other openings.

Positions in brokerage houses,
banks, utility concerns, wholesale and
retail houses, packing and mail order
houses, chemical corporations, hdvez‘e
tising agencies, and stenographic and
secretarial work will be some of the
ones students from Grinneli will
probably be seeking, the director of
personnel said. ‘

Attitude Changes

While discussing Chicago as a field
for positions, Mr. Dreese stressed the
fact that Chicago was not the only
city in which to seek positions, nam—
ing other cities where desirable con-
tacts may be made by Grinnell men.
He plans a trip to Minneapolis after
spring vacation to study prospects
there, and stated that in a smaller
way that city offered as desirable
positions as does Chicago,

From an explanation of the pur-
pose of his trip ..to .Chicago, Mr.
Dreese naturally turned to a discus-
sion of personnel work in general, and
pointed out that along with the
growth of this type of work in the
past few years has come a. change in
the attitude of firms in general tow»
ard sending out men to colleges to
recruit seniors for their employ. “To-
day," he said, "only concerns which
have large training programs
tour the campuses, and at the
recent convention of the National As—
sociation of Placement and Personnel
Officers at Atlantic City, it was the

Lang—an Beats
Five in 3-0 Tilt

Three Nips Gates Saturday
in Hot Melee, 6 to 5;
Dibble Wins.

Andy Arent, the original hard-luck
pitcher. ran into a string of trouble
against the Langan hall indoor base-
ball team Tuesday afternoon and,
although his pitching had all the
marks of being unbeatable, the Build-
ing Two aggregation ramped away
with a 3 to o victory over Clark.

The Langan infield was air tight

yesterday, and Briggs' slow bail
had the losers keeping the sphere in
that same infield. The game was a
battle to the finish, with Langan man-
ufacturing one run in the fifth in-
ning, and sneaking over a couple
more in the sixth.
Saturday‘s games were no less of
the thrilling variety, Ruff of Build-
ing Three and Kukolich of Gates
tangiing in a p'retty pitching duel.
The game was played outdoors.
The Kelly Stables men finally won
by a 6-5 count, but it was only after
trailing twice, and playing eleven in-
nings that they turned the trick.
The score was 2 to 2 at the end of
the game. Four scored twice in the
ninth inning but Three tied it up at
four-all. Four again came through
with a mark in the eleventh, but
again the score proved only an in-
centive to the stubborn ads of Three,
and they came back in e last half
of the inning with a. pair of runs and
victory.

Wilhelm of Dibble turned in anoth-
er of his sensational pitching exhi-
bitions against Smith hall Saturday
to get credit for a no hit, no run
game, and a 6 to 0 Victory. The
Smith men failed to get a ball out of
the infield and were allowed only two
walks. Phil Risser, Smith pitcher,
was hit regularly and some infield
errors permitted the Dibble men to
annex a victory.

Juniors Defeat
Sophs, 26 to 23

Girls’ Cage Championship
Decided Last Night;
Exciting Fray.

The juniors nosed out the sopho-
more sextet 26 to 23 in a nip—and-
tuck battle for the women‘s inter-
class basketball championship last
night. The junior team, undefeated
for three seasons, suffered the stiff-
est competition of their entire career,
but made a desperate rally in the
last quarter to push out the hard—
fighting sophs by a three-point mar-
gin.

The sophomore centers and guards
noticeably cramped the junior style
in the first half, which enped 11 to
lo witlrthe sophs lagging. In the
second half the sophomore forwards
rallied to take the lead, only to loose
it and fight back to tie the score re—
peatedly. Finally in the last few
minutes of play the juniors broke
loose with several dizzy tosses, too
late for the sophomores to stage
their customary comeback.

The lineup:
Juniors
Mchrah
Coggeshaii
Curtis
King
Parzybok g.
Cole g. Sells

Features between halves were a
clog by Mary Hell and Cecil Panor,
and eccentric dancing by Helen
Greene. The game was under the
auspices of the Women's Honor C
society.
