by Paul Draus

I‘m sitting here, slowly masticating my
pencil into a soggy, spiintery stalk of pink
wood and yellow paint. trying to decide
upon a subject for my column this week. I
can feel the tension in the air, the entire
campus holding its breath in anticipation
of my every written word, each and every
Grinnell student asking him or herself the
suspenseful question, “I wonder what
Draus is going to rip on this time?”

Well, maybe not everybody. But I'm
sure there are some people who are
wondering what, if anything. i will decide
to write about this week. Will Draus,
perhaps, say something offensive about
homosexuals? Or maybe Hispanics? Or
will lie just go all out and attack the institu-
tion of motherhood?

And tiiose same people are waiting.
wrist muscles tightly coiled, ready to
snatch up a pen and pounce upon our
hapless hero with a scathing editorial
response the second he steps out of line and
brashly speaks his mind about some sen-
sitive subject which lies nestled close to
the heart of many a righteous, upstanding
crusader for decency.

At least that‘s the way I picture it It’s
kind of a melodramatic viewpoint. but
please. humor me lreaiize that most peo-
ple probably don't give a rodent’s rear end
what i do or say, Actually l'd prefer it that
way, but my brain keeps making me think
that everyone out there despises me and
wants to get me No one has told me perr
sonaliy that he hates me. but I can't help
sensing a little hostility in the air Maybe
the letters in the newspaper have
something to do with my feeling this way i
don't know if anyone else has been paying
attention, but the last few issues of the s
and B have featured a few select
criticisms of my writing, my moral
character, my ideas and weil,..me. But
hey. i guess We asked for it, right? I have,

 

 

 

Opinion

View from the Outside

week after week (last week excepted, 1
think), insisted upon writing columns
which seems almost programed to offend.

Why do I do this? Do I enjoy making peer
pie angry with me?

I think somebody actually asked one of
my friends (I do have some! that exact
question. “Does that Draus guy just like
making people mad at him, or what?"
Nobody ever asks these things to my face,
for some reason. its just as well, though. i
really wouldn’t know what to say.

Would 1 say, “Sure 1 love pissing people
off. It makes my life wortll living " Well, I
suppose that's true, to some extent, I do
get a kind of thrill out of jotting people out
of complacency i mean, it must be admit-
ted, l have done that I’m sure no one
would have written a letter about the
"myths of white Americans" in last
week's paper if it wasn‘t for me Or at
least, they wouldn't have used my name in
it it it weren‘t for me,

But. In spite of all that, I’m really not
trying to hurt anybody wiien 1 write these
things. I'm not really trying to make
enemies. i just end up doing it. somehow.

Some people might be proud of that. I
know I am, in a way. Take last week for in
stance. when the third letter in two weeks
was printed in response to a single article
of mine. A friend of mine said, "Hey Paul.
that's three letters for one column. You've
get yourself a hatrtrick " l thought that
was pretty funny. So I guess it does give
me a certain warped sense of satisfaction.

However, i have decided to fight my
cynical tendencies and start showing some
consideration for the Values and beliefs of
my fellow Grinnell students. And that is
why. starting today, I’m only going to
write about those things which I'm sure no
one on this campus will find offensive.

Now all l have to do IS think of
something

Professor criticizes editorial

To the Editor:

I just read your latest editorial in The
Scarlet Lind Black and wanted to respond
to some of your statements.

First — you should know that an in-
troductory course in women's studies will
be taught during the [all semester of 198'].
Part of my sabbatical is being used to plan
this course,

Second 7 We do not have a women's
studies department at Grinnell College.
Thus, it is difficult for the women's studies
department to offer any course, AS you
will note in the Schedule of courses for next
fall, the course I am going to teach is a
special topic, and it will be offered through
the social studies diViSion.

Third A The person appointed to the
Noun Chair was to hold a joint appoint-
ment in a discipline. in this case it was

English. Therefore, the courses taught this
semester were upper level courses in the
English department,

Fourth m A faculty seminar is being
taught by Professor Broe this semester to
address some of your concerns about
students and faculty being
“unknowledgeable and inexperienced."
Another seminar will be taught next fall.

Fifth — You are incorrect when you
identify Louise Noun as the benefactor of
the Noun Chair. It was named for her, but
she was not the benefactor. This is an inex-
cusable error.

As you know the schedules and courses
for the current year were established
before the Noun chair was finally ape
pointed. Thus. it would be impossible dur
ing the first year to make significant

with racism"

To the Editor:

in response to Valesta Wiggins' letter
(April 24, 1937). I think it is unfortunate
that She resorts to a form of raCisl'n as she
seeks to attack racism in her rebuttal of
Paul Draus’ letter (April 17, 1987). she
classifies all white Americans as belong-
ing to a myth oi “invincihility. pureness.
and virility” governed by the “macho man
image of white male society.” In addition,
she points to “the black experience” as be-
ing Composed of the "realities" of "birth,
struggle, and death" while white
Americans are concerned "with such false
constants as money, power, and safety,"

These assertions are blatantly racist
with regards to both the “white” and
“black experience.” Firstly, I do not
believe that there is “the White” or “the
black experience." Defining an “ex
perience" as applying to all members of a
particular race overlook very important
factors such an national origin, religion.
geographical location, and economic
status. is the "black experience" oi an
unemployed l-laitian immigrant living in
New York City the same as an auto factory
worker's in Detroit, 3 small business
owner in Atlanta, or a college student at
Grliinell'.’ In the same light, is the “white
experience" the same for a Jewish Rus
sian immigrant in Brooklyn. a steel
worker in Pennsylvania. an office superr
Visor in South Carolina. or a college stu-
dent at Grinnell'l These questions don't
even take into account the [actors of age
and gender which greatly influence
perceptions of race

Secondly, Ms. Wiggins' divisions bet
ween realities and false Constants are
greatly flawed. Can any person go through
a day in his life without using or coming in»
to contact with money? One does not feed
and clothe a family with “love” [which She

 

cites as being unique of the “black ex
perience"), In addition, since when has
“safety” been a concern only relating to
the “white experience”? I come from an
area oi Brooklyn where there are project
patrol composed of both white and black

changes in the curriculum. Also. the Noun
chair's responsibility is to help faculty in;
tegrate and develop courses which relate
to women‘s concerns. I believe that you
will discover several courses are being
developed for 1937-35 which will focus on
women.

While I agree with your concerns in
general. I am disappointed that you did not
get more information before writing this
editorial. Did you talk to Professor Broe? i
can't believe that you did. Yet, it would
seem to me that this would be a logical
thing to do. i so hope that you will try and
find out what is really the situation on
campus in relation to women's studies and
courses and inform your readers about the
progress that is being made, To do other-

\ wise seems rather irresponsible to me. 7

Senior cites music department failures

To the Editor:

In the April 17 edition of the Scarlet and
Black. Lisa Steege rebuffed a previous
editorial claim that the tine-arts deparlr
ment was one of the weakest departments
on campus by pointing to the merits of the
art program, 'Fine-arls,' however. refers
to more than 'art' in a narrow sense.

Whereas I have had no personal ex-
perience with drawing and art history at
Grinnell and thus cannot comment on that
aspect of ‘art' on campus. the quality of
the offerings for players of stringed Ills
struments is ridiculously inconsistent with
the calibre of Grinnell's other
noiiacadcmic programs The orchestra is
ho hum than my high school ensemble.
and I include myself in this critique as I
have played with the group all year No
wonder advanced string players on Cams
pus refuse to join No wonder there are
always more people in the orchestra than

in the audience at one of our concerts.
Terry King is a fine conductor and
deserves no blame. The source of
Grinnell's deficient string program does
not lie at the individual level,

There is a peculiar enigina surrounding
string music at Grinnell. why is the string
program — with the world-c Mirecourt
Trio in residence 7 significantly less
dynamic than either the vocal or tiic other
instrumental programs? There are
several groups til both of these other
musical arcos lhiit meet and perform on a
regular basis, but, with the exception of
the UrclieSUd. there are no string groups
that do so. And most of thc slriiig players
in the lost orchestra concert were guest
performers hired to fill-up the cinpiy
chairs on stage The college spent what
probably amounted to several hundred
dollars importing string players when two
of its own string instructors failed to sup

port the effort of the orchestra members
by playing in the concert.

There are no string players on campus.
memhcl's of the (means faculty will
argue, so there are no offerings. And as
long as there are no offerings, no string
playes will come to Grlniiell Unless a
member of the string faculty intervenes to
force change, this unfortunate situation
will continue to perpetuate itseifyear after
yea . Members of the Mirecourt Trio,
however. define their role at Grinnell first
and foremost as performers. Thcy colic

citizens. They don‘t seem to conSlder the
matter of safety as a false constant ap-
plicable to only white, male Americans.

As for power and struggle, these terms
are too vague to be applicable to any single
race. it we take them with regards to
politics, it becomes hard to defend a posi-
tion that tries to even separate power from
struggle along racial lines. Politics is
essentially a struggle for power. To say no
black Americans are concerned with this
struggle is to ignore the civtl rights move
ment and is to overlook the many major
cities in the United States now governed by
black mayors (such as Philadelphia,
Detroit, Chicago, and Washington, DC).
it is precisely the disparity of power
distribution that has resulted in a great
deal of struggle between certain groups of
whites and blacks.

Ms Wiggins takes another view otstrugr
gle: “The lack of suffering of many white
Americans is reflected in their inability to
Cope With the realities of life." As she
stated before these realities are "birth.
struggle, an death.” 1 question whether
any race has a monopoly on coping with
birth or death, As for suffering and Strugr
gie, how many white Americans comprise
“Many" in Ms. Wiggins’ condescending
and omniscient Conclusion? Can one
decide that people have oi haven‘t suf-
fered according to mere racial division?
Where would one place the farm communlr
ty in the Midwest? Or the Jews who have
Survived the Holocaust‘7 Or'the million of
elderly people who live on a bare sub-
ststencc level as they wait for their Social
Security checks?

Fighting racism with racism only
separates people into abstract categories
and ignores problems such as who in par-
ticular is being exploited and who in par-
ticular are the exploiters? it is only when
we look at racism in a more rigorous and
discerning manner that we can begin to
confront it on a realistic level instead of
one that is itself racist, dogmatic. and
idealistic. 7 Eric Fisher, '82!
