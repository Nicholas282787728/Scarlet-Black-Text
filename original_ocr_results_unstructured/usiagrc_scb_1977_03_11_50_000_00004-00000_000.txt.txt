Let’s avoid
power politics

This is Grinnell College, not Watergate II.

One SGA presidential election was held Wednesday and a
run-off is being held today. Best of luck to the one who comes

out ahead and to the person who comes out second. Mav
neither of them take themselves nor SGA politics too

seriously in the future. And may the rest of us avoid the
same. '

SGA does have important functions to perform on this
campus. many of which have been extolled in this space.
However, all those involved in SGA activity should keep
that activity in perspective.

They should avoid becoming wrapped up in wheeling and
dealing behind the scenes. They should avoid getting
dragged into games of ego politics. On a campus the size of

Grinnell it is completely feasible to act openly and honestly
in SGA and all other dealings.

During the recent presidential campaign there were

several instances where politiking was taken to extremes.
We find this situation ironical since all of the candidates

stressed openness and increased information ﬂow in their
campaigns. We hope that campaign politicking will not
manifest itself in next year’s SGA business.

SGA politics are not worth all kinds of cloak and dagger
manipulations anyway. The energy and efforts of SGA
members can more effectively be channeled into the con»
tinuation of worthwhile programs and working for positive
change at the college.

If SGA members, and students as well, keep SGA activity
in perspective to all the other things going on around them,
elitist tendencies and charges can more easily be dispelled.
People will not feel turned off and disgusted by SGA power
politics. Though a few students will always be very involved
in student government, an openness in dealing with all
comers will provide the opportunity for others to get in-
volved.

That involvement is important, but let’s avoid get-
ting dragged into senseless power politics.

Need for personal living space -

by Elaine Ashbnugh

Recently, a friend of mine Wrote
an article for a new feminist art
and politics publication out of New
York, Centering around a photo-
documentary entitled “Women:
Body, Space, and Personal
Ritual," the article concentrated
on women working within and
relating to the living space which
they create to Suit lheir own
special needs.

For men as well as women,
however, the idea of space-
relationship is fully pertinent. Here
at Grinnell recognition of personal
space-relationship is needed, Too
often we consider our living spaces
at college as only transitory,
especially in the last years, as “lhe
end" draws nearer and nearer As
we pile stacks of books around us
and drop off to sleep upon a bed
halfrcovered with notecardsv
empty pen cartridges, and broken
pencil leads, we begin to lose sight
of our need for a regulated
(although often possibly
systematically confused) livmg
space, personally tailored to our
individual needs.

A loss in the feeling of personal
well-being appears consequent

 

upon the lack of \vcllrdefined
space, The feeling of drifting, so

Trustee Rosenfield

often accompanying admittedly
transitory periods of life such as
college and summer job habitat,
and so often Cited as loss of identity
in studies of the flight of rural
population to the cities in this and
the last century, appears as a
primary consequence.

The photographer of the
“Women: Body, Space, and
Personal Ritual" documentary
recently spent ten days in a
hospital with pelvic inﬂammatory
disease, She noted a definite lack of
space and personal ritual as a
result of her bodily disintegration.
She considers that her discomfort,
occasioned by the lack of her usual
personally adapted and
suited enVlronment, served to
retard hcr convalescence.
Similarly, she believes that people
unhappy with the place they live or
without a real living space are
more vulnerable to disintegration
of the body

Exactly two months ago a very
dear friend contracted hepatitis
and died, The reactions of those
close to him point again to the need
for personal space and ritual. One
friend fought desperately to retain
his own space by making often
unwelcomed demands on those
closely related to himself and to

 

thc dying person. He himself had
had a close call with hepatitis and
appears to have needed to test, 27."
provc the stability of his own
living space while witnessing the
tragic disintegration oi cnother's,
so interlaced with his own

My own reactions to the death
were complicated by the fact thatI
had just returned from ‘Europe.
Trying to establish my space in the
overshadowmg presence of death,
as well as the unfamiliarity of
America, I found myself asking
questions about people, places,
things, withwhich 1 was previously
familiar. Other friends tended i
combine their Spaces, their ritual:
in an attempt to fill 'the unfillable
gap left by the death,

Theii‘regularities inherent in life
necessitate the balancing force of 2
satisfactorily adapted living space,
whether satisfactorily organized or
satisfactorily dishevelled. A space,
no matter how meager and
regardless of the duration of its
use. can and should be fashioned to
the needs of the individual. A
temporary environment such as
that experienced at Grinnell should
not be allowed to supercede the
need for a personalized living
space,

criticizes campus attitudes

To thtf editor: I fully endorse the
sentiments expressed in Jim
Lawry's letter recently published
in the Scarlet and Black. The
faculty and some of the students (I
blame the faculty more than the
students) are apparently engaged
in a concerted movement to keep
the campus in a constant state of
unrest and dissension This at-
titude can be nothing but damaging
to the reputation of one of the
nation’s leading liberal arts
colleges.

I am personally quite distressed,
l have been a trustee for more than
thirtyfive years and doubt if I
have ever missed a board meeting.
What used to be pleasurable and
productive gatherings are fast
becoming a disagreeable chore.
Trustee meetings are so taken up
with coping with unreasonable
faculty pressures that not enough
time is left for trustee con
sideration of, and acting upon,
matters of major consideration I
now find that my happiest thoughts
about the college occur when I am
in Des Moines and not in Grinnell. I
hope that my affection for the
college will not disintegrate into
just nostalgia for the past not
mixed witha feeling of pride tor its
presentrday accomplishments,

 

The Scarlet and Black
which I read now from a sense of
duty beats a constant drum of
attack on the administration. The
last good word for any ad-
ministration I can remember was
a mild good word for J.B.Grinnell
when, in 1846, he plunked a silver
dollar on the table and said, “Let's
start a college.” If .l.B,G. Could
read the Scarlet and Black today
and see what a monster he had
created,hewould demand his dollar
back with interest, From now on, I
think I’ll read only the JD. ads.

I attended the college so long ago.

that dinosaurs still roamed the
campus. ”Affirmative action"
meant trying to kiss a girl on the
first date and ”equal opportunity”
meant flipping a coin in Freddie
Mlllslagle's pool hall to see who got
the first shot, The top full
professors got $3.000 a year salary
and while there was some grumr
bling among the students that the
lazy bums were overpaid, the
issue was not of enough interest to
make it a Scarlet and Black cause.

Does this mean that those were
the good old days when everything
was joy and happiness? Not a
chance, A terrible and ghastly
scourge hung over the campus, far
more serious than the events of

Hear Halperin

To the editor: instead of having
Dr. Henry Kissinger (as originally
desired) as this year’s Rosenfield
Lecturer. one of Dr. Kissinger’s
strongest critics, Morton Halperin,
will be speaking, Undoubtedly
Halperin’s appearance won‘t at
tract the public attention and
hoopla that Henry Kissinger
commands. However, it is likely

that Mr. Halperin's speeches will ,

contain more of substance than we
could have expected from Dr,
Kissinger

Mi' Halperin, once one of the
bright young Establishment
figures, is now a political outsider.
i-iis present reputation stems from
his activities of the past few years.
First, Halpei-in had the audacity to
resign from Dr. Kisstnger's
National Security Council staff
after a dispute over our Vietnam
policy. Halperin has become an
outspoken critic of American

foreign policy and the Defense
Department. His 1974 book,
Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign
Policy. has been called, “a first
rate in»depth study of huw the us,
government operates with regard
to foreign policy,” ,

Recently Halperin won a
civil suit against President Nixon,
John Mitchell, and H.R.Haldeman.
They were responsible for twenty
one months of illegal wiretaps
against Halperin and his family.

Halperin not only has somcthing
to say, he knows how to say things
well. no presently serves as a
foreign affairs commentator for
National Public Radio.

Mr. I-Iulperin will be in Grinnell
April 4 and 5, the Monday and
Tuesday after break. So before you
gct back into the grind, it might be
worth your while to drop by

today. In short, THE FOOD WA

TERRIBLE. This problem did not
affect the highly paid faculty, but it
haunted the students day and
night. in the fall, dire predictions
were made that by spring unv
dernourished StudenB would be
dropping by the score all over the
campus. -Calcutta and Bombay
would look like health spas come
pared to our campus. As a Scarlet
and Black columnist I contributed
my share to this near riot.

Finally, the spring ofrmy seni
year my father called to my at-
tention the fact that during my four
years at Grinnell, my weight had
gone from 115 to 190 pounds. He
suggested that my weaken '
condition might be caused by
excess obesity and not unr
dernourishment . In other words, I
was off base, To my everlasting
credit, 1 got the message.

Maybe most of the hue and cry
on campus today is about as well
founded as the food problem in my
day. Anyway, I hate to see such at

Response t3
Collins

To the editor: In response to Will
Collins’s essay of last week. I offer
these remarks:

He misstates the issue when he
considers “the liberally educated
person’s value to society." The
issue is rather to What extent the
liberally educated person can
make sense of a “society"
notorious for its unintelligibllity. In
this way. a liberal education leg:
and in itself Liberal arts‘
stitutions are not responsible for
the decay of a civilization. The
liberally educated person ought to
be capable oi explicating
“society" in which he finds him.
and, within reason, doing whatever
he wants with his explication. To
the extent that he is capable of
these things, he is not mentally
masturbating; he is building
character? 'l Peilco
