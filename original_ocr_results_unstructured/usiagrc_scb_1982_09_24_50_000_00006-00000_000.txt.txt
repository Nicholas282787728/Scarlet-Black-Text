BEST BET v . . This Weekend’s best bet is
hard to call since none of the mOVies rank
as particularly exceptional, but rather as
commercially successiul. So, it really
comes down to a matter of taste. Though
all might not agree, Shampoo (1975, 112
min ) seems the most appealing of the lot.
This flim stars Warren Beatty as George,
a fashionable Beverly Hills hairdresser
who cuts and Curls his way into the hearts
and beds of many a woman, His supposed-
ly permanent lover Jill (Goldie Hawn)
smnds by while George cavorts with his
old girlfriend Jackie (Julie Christie), her
lover's wife (Lee Grant) and Grant‘s
daughter (Carrie Fisher). Shampoo deals
with the day, election day 1968, on which
the precarious ioundations oi George’s life
begin to collapse on top of him. The film
tries to be both a cutting satire and a sen
sitive portrayal or a desperate soul, but it
cannot completely do both. The movie does
have a certain charm about it and some
rather humorous, ii tasteless, moments,
It stands as a nice diversionary piece,
showing Warren beatty and Hal Ashby
ineing Tilerel before they moved onwards
and upwards

.\ GOLDEN OLDll-I For all you truly
devoted movie ouiis, an unquestioned
classic » Angels with Dirty Faces (1938, 97
mint. Made in the days when Hollywood
attempted to include a moral in social
drama, this iilm shows the diiierent paths
the lives oi two gutter kids take. One (Pat
O'Brien) becomes an lrish priest, the

. other (James Cagney) a mob-connected
killer The social comments come in when
.cagney pretends to be a coward on the way
to the electric chair to eliminate the
possibility of being the object oi hero woi»
ship in the part oi the Dead End kids
Though predictable, grim and dated, this
classic iilm remains the iirst or a genre
and deserves recognition as such

tiit'i STRIKE AGAIN in Live and Let
Die (1973, 121 min.), e eighth of the
James Bond series and die iirst starring
Roger Moore. Some miss Sean Connery a
lot, but there are those who believe Moore
to be a bit more urbane and civilized. This
typically Fleming plot takes Bond to the
Caribbean in his attempt to unearth a
large heroin ring. All the necessary
elements exist: ilashy photography, exotic
locale and sexless sex objects in pink
lipstick lJane Seymour, Gloria Hundry,
Madeline Smith). Generally a nice bit of
entertaining liuii ii you can manage to
overlook the misogyny, racism and sadism
beneath. Unfortunately by number eight,
all the Bond films look and sound the
same.

should not miss this film. A masterpiece of

The Who's rebirth

by Daniel Kiatz

Maintaining rock and roll into middle
age has become a fascinating dilemma.
rock being a medium that traditionally is
viewed as a testament of youth The Roll-
ing Stones have resolved this by refusing
to grow up and, consequently, they tend to
look like buiioons.

The Who on the other hand have grown
up, struggled with the aging process, pro-
gressed, regressed and spit it all out ior
public consumption,

It's hard. their latest release, is a pot.
pourri oi sketches that bring The Who's aur
dienee up to date on the state oi rock's
most complex band. It is their best album
since Who By Numbers and contains some
of the most eclectic music they have ever
produced. its 12 songs depict a band that
can both celebrate and reject the
phenomenon of growing Older in modern
society. All oi these songs are good, some
are great,

The album's single, “Athenea,” is Pete
Townshend‘s celebration of fatherhood.
The airwaves are destined to be bombard-
ed with this song, and it really is a charm-
ing and touching little ditty. Unfortunate-
ly, radio may destroy this song.

Fortunately, there is much better music
on the album, “Cooks County” and the
very iunky “Eminence Front" are solid
examples of Townshend's remarkable

Shangoya offers rhythmic delights
Calypso- Reggae band delivers powerful sound

Get ready for this Saturday night when
the acclaimed Calypso Reggae band
Shangoyo unleases its stuif, One of the hots
test bands in the Twin Cities, Shangoya
provides an intoxicating blend oi rhythms
that promises to have dancers on their feet
instantly

Though based in the Twin Cities, this
seven member band has members hailing
from four different countries ~ from
Trinidad to Japan. Their diverse
backgrounds give the group a cross
cultural sound encompassing a variety of
scintillating topical rhythms.

“We play happy music. high energy
music, that is Shango, that is Calypso . . .
We play ior love. togetherness and equalis
ty. Wherever we play, we play to the best
oi our ability.“ ‘ Peter Nelson,
Shaiigoya's leader

Be sure to join Shallgoya when they get
the place moving this Saturday at 9:30
pm. in North Lounge.

 

ability to comment on social conditions
without preaching "Front" especially
highlights Townshend's sarcastic ims
pulses. yet John Entwistle's solid bass
groove elevates the song iar beyond Sims
pie social commentary

This type oi communication is precisely
what makes It's Hard such a fine record: it
is a unified effort to lift music from a
superficial form of entertainment or Com-
mentary to a prominent iorm oi expres
sion. something this band hasn't been-able
to dolor quite some time. This same‘kind
oi group eiiort is what made so many other-
Who records great.

"l'vc Known No War” brings The Who
into the ‘305 with the same kind of en
thusiasm that made them electriiying 10
years ago A pressing issue is given the
treatment only The Who can deliver —
urgency, conviction and a keen artistic
sense.

The title track crystalizes the band’s re
cent endeavors periectly 7 it is hard to
consistently produce quality material,
especially given the public‘s high expecta-
tions. Sorrow, pain and irustration
permeate this song These feelings may be
a personal reaction for Townshend, but it s
a‘much more universal human problem
and that is what Tho Who Is all about.

Entwistle's three contributions to the
album are among his iinest eiiorts “One
At A Time" unites his personal anger with
his humorous musical approach. The

results are simply wonderful,

Despitc a wealth of great material, one
song. “One Life's Enough," stands out as
the real gem on this album. This sensual
and sweet reminiscing oi a teenage
romance features a Simple arrangement
oi piano and string-synthesizers, making it
one of the most elegant and moving songs
this band has ever produced

Other factors that make this album work
so well: Roger Daltrey‘s outstanding sing»
ing which provides the album with a
cohesiveness the previoustwo who albums
lacked, Glyn John's iresh, crisp and live'
production and, most crucially, the ability
of The Who to function as a single unit _
even Kenny Jones drumming has been in
corporated into the band’s general con
cept

There has been a lot speculation about
this record —— is it the band 5 finale’.Y
Everything on the vinyl suggests the op-
posite; the iuture oi the group appears to
be more optimistic than ever. it's Hard is
the first truly honest Who record in years.
Its objectives are clearly deiined and
thoughtrully expressed, That alone makes
it a worthwhile album, but the record goes
beyond that. It is a rebirth for The Who,
capturing a spirit that can only be deiined
as The New Who,

Today at a pm, itch will present a
retrospective on The Who, culminating at 5
pm. with a complete tracking oi It's Hard.
