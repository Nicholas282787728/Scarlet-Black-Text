SCARLET & BLACK

 

VINEGAR TOM from page to
ecstatic mother wrote an articlein her
local paper about theexperienee, and
another person in that same town
called in the Board ofMedical Exam-
iners, who started an investigation.
Duringapreliminary hearingt‘orthese
two women, they were not allowed
legal counsel. A grand jury hearing
dropped the charges under the stipu-
lation that the two midwives had to
agree to never practice their profes4
sion again. Although they probably
would have won had the ease ever
gone to a full LriZIl, the cost and time
commitment would have not made it
worth it, especially since there is no
legislation protecting them. Even if
they had won they still would
havebeen candidates for further prose
ecution.

It is this connection between the
old witch huntsduringthewitchcraze
and the current attempts of the FDA
that make the play Vinegar Tom so
pertinent to us here and now. This is
one of the main reasons that director
Voertman chose to direct this play
right now. The challenging unconr
ventionality of the play also inter-
ested her, as there is no direct plot.
although the characters all move
through stages towards an inevitable
conclusion. The story does not build
like an ordinary play, and is inter-

spersed withcontemporarymusie di-
reeled by Musical Director Barbara
Lien and sung by on-stage singers
Voemnan alsolikedthe l‘aet thatthere
are no real stars in the show. Most of
the pans are ofequal size and impor»
tance, which is good for a group of
young students. It helps keep the
play from falling outofbalance. Set
and light designer Philippa Gordon
has designed for thisplay before,and
was very enthusiastic about doing it
again.

Voertmart feels very pleased with
her cast and how they have matured
while dealing with this subject mat-
tcr. Manyofdtesubjeetsraisedinthe
play and tn rehearsal arc taboo sub
jects that were uncomfortable, but
she feels that they have all been very
matureandlntelligent. “I'veenjoyod
working on the show a great deal and
I’ve particularly enjoyed this east.“
With costume designs by Kaoime
Malloy, the play will be performed
September 29 through OctoberZ at 8
pm. in the Flanagan Arena Theatre.

for getting the ball rolling for orches-
tra again. So the orchestra committee
has been there to give him ideas and
help him out," she said. “One ofthe
rnain complaints about orchestra has
been that there hasn’t been much
cohesiveness, which lets it fall apart
easily.” According to Suzukito help
with this problem,the committee has
been actively planning “run"

year. Such activities include a cook-
out, this week’s pizza study break,
coloring Peter and the Wolfsigns for
the campus, an orchesua camp and 2t
“run-out concert", which means the
group would go somewhere else to
do a concert.

Forty-one members strong, the
Grinnell Orchestra is bigger and bet
ter this year than it has ever been.
according to Knight; even without
the special recruiting that Knight has
done in preceding years {orthe larger
performances. “Looking at numbers
and across-the-board ability, this is
far and away the best orchestra in my
years here,” he said. “A really good
thing is that there are no blank spots
in sections like there have been in the
pasL"

to Suzuki. “We recruited like hell
last year just to get people into or

aboutthe members oldie orchestra
