“HER MAD BARGAIN”
Louis B, Mayer has selected "Her
rMad Bargain” as the title for the
latest Anita stewart release.

The story at “Her lilad Bargain”
'is based on the experiences oi a girl,
who, after attempting suicide, signs
a pledge that she will live tor at
least one year. Love enters her heart,
and, by the time the end of the pro»
national period is reached, she stands
on the threshold or marital happi-
ness, convinced that lire is well worth
the struggle after all.

Unique in theme, the picture has
many little ironiccl twists that lay
hare the shame or society and arouse
sympathy for the girl who is thrust
out into the world to battle alone
against its vicious elements.
