Held in the South Forum lonnge last
Thursday, the newly formatted trustee open
forum put regnilar students, student presents
ers, SGA representatives, trustees and admin~
istratron in four small discussion groups. The
groups then responded to questions about
various aspects of the college including selre
governance and whether or not graduating se—
niors were truly representative attire Grinncll
College mi ion statement.

According to SGA President Megan (307
ering '08, the new format provided a more in-
timate venue for trustee-student interaction.
“Everyone at Grinnell operates in the currency
of relationships. Its not about what your posi-
tion is, it‘s not about your title,‘ rts aboiit how
you form relationships," she said So one thing
we thought would help would be to demystify
the Board of Trustees.”

In the groups, the trustees often talked
about their life experiences and careers in the
context of the discussions and tried to explain
what they felt their responsibilities to the col»
lege were and how the annual meetings were
operated,

In response to one discussion question,
suldcnts consistently mentioned the environ»
merit, ﬁnancial aid and the high costs of are
tending Grinnell as their main complaint
about the trustees.

Joel Spicgel '78 and other trustees, are
tempted to explain Grinncll's financial .trd pole
icr and cost. “Our commitment at Grinncll is
to needs blind admission," he said \‘Vi: want
to stay neetls blind and tliats a moral coma
.mtment its a source tttpnde to. pretty much
everyone I talk to.”

Other trustees, including Harold W.
“Hal' Fuson 67, mentioned how the real
cost of educating students at Grinnell remains
far above the actual cost of admission, and that
the college's remarkably low alumni contribu-
tions exacerbate the problem.

The new format seemed to be a hit, as
groups continued their discussions past the al-
lotted hour.

The format also included poster presentae
tion by student groups, some bragging about
recent accomplishment others, calling for
trustee action. The lengthier discussions may

have cut into the time of poster presenters, but
it seemed that many of the present trustees
were able to make the rounds.

While the new format provided more
trustee-strident interaction, some students ex»
pressed concerns about their efficacy. "Even if
something peaks their interest at [the forum]—
or in SGA’s speech later—there is no way for

work.”

The simple lnck ofptivacy before and atrer
sessions can also exacerbate this hesitance to seek
help. The use of student drivers in transporting
students to the Mental Health Center. along
with the close quarters of the waiting room, can
create an atmosphere of insecurity.

In response to
students' potential
reticence to use the
Health Centers Pm,
vrded transportation,
student driver Nora
Shields '08 said, "We
sign a conﬁdentiality
contract, so [informa—
tion about] anyone
who gets help stays at the Health Center...cven
ifpeople have that fear, [that information] is not
going anywhere.”

Shields added that students should not be
deterred by thoughts that the drivers judge their
passengers. “When
driving, you realize that
[using Mental Health
Services is] very note
mal ...asking for help
should be a sign or sta-
bility,"shc said.

When asked about
the lack of privacy in
the waiting room, Davis said, “We‘ve talked
about hanging up sound-prooﬁng blankets and
using a white noise machine to drown out the
sound," and added,“One change that we’ll really

The current Mental Health Committee,
comprised otstttdents, faculty, and employees or
the Mental Health Center, has been investigat-
ing these issues by hiring two external investlgae
tors. The reviewers, Dr. Donald Marshall and
Dr. Terry Mason, have worked with student
counseling at the Uni»
versity of Puget sound
and Iowa State Univer‘a
srry. They have been
observing the current
state of Grinnell's metre
tal health services and
its effectiveness, and will
submit their report by
mid-summer.

Mental healthcare at Grinnell underwent a
similar review directed by thcnaVrcc President of
Student Services Tom Crady after three strident
suicides during the 2003-2004 school year. The
review resulted in the establishment of the walks
in program at the Pow—
eshiek County Mental
Health Center.

According to Stern,
the advantages of
the critrent system of
mental health services
should not be forgot
ten: “We don’t need to
throw the baby outwith the bathvmter . . . we just
need to tweak around the edges. we don't need
to completely overhaul Mental Health necessart
ily to meet student needs.”

Bernal, who has not had access to the lets
tcrs and has received limited information from
the Grinnell Police, said that the school’s focus
throughout has been on solving the investigm
tion in order to begin the healing process. Given
the circumstances, some difference of opinion
was inevitable, she said, and that there was of-
ten ncicr any perfect course of action, “1 think
it's important for people to know that there are
alumys going to be multiple perspectives on how
to respond," she said. “The only thing that allows
me to sleep a! night, through all of this, is know—
ing that we’ve kept it at a high priority, to bring
closure.”

senior, for instance said they were impressed that
administrators like Bernal were so resolute in

cameras in the mailroom.

Jose segebre '09, who was targeted in the
first mailing but not in either of the subsequent
incidents, said that he understood the need to
wrthhold information and that some demands to
disclose more facts were unreasonable.“Thc only
thing that I was really upset over was, though,
was how unrealistic and immature some people

Wray said that he could not comment on the
investigations progress but said that he recog-
nized the frustration of those involved, “An in»

one,”he said.“And when you have three different
law enforcement agencies working on this one as
well as college security, we're working as fast as
we can."

In addition to the difficulties posed by sig~
nificrmt inter-departmental coordination, me
said that the investigation was stymied by a lack
of information. “We believe there are people out
there in the Grinnell College community who
know who is responsible for this," he said. “If
anyone has any information regarding this, they
can leave a message anonymously at the police
department.”

Throughout the incidents, members of the
community have emphasized the need to move
forward in a positive way The senior said that

through the healing process and mentioned ally

“Because hate crimes aren’t n common thing
and because sexuality is a weird doing to talk
