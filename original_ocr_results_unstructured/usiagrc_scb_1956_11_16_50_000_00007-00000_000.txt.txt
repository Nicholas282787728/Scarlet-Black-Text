all season.

Speaking of Mr Simone. he
was the object of a Joke last
week which was anything but
funny. as attcsted to by the
fact that it hack-fired with
gusto on the jokcsters Due to
this event much of the campus
has bccn taking a closer look at
said gentleman and what he
has meant to the college.

To start with, he and his
cross—country team, captained
by Larry Schalcger, have done
both themselves and the
school proud throughout the
season. The team goes into
the conference final tomorrow
at Chicago with a 6-2 record
and will be strong contenders
for the title. However they
fare I know they will have
done their level best.

The swimming team. under
his guidance, has become a con-' '
sistcnt power in the conference.
Under his tutelage the mermen

here and I'm now a senior

factor. He has put in untold
extra hours concerning hinr
