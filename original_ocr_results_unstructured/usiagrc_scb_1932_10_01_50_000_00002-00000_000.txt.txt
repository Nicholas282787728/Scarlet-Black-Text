PEP hnvrv'hs

A week ago we deplored the lack of pop shown
at lllc Penn game. IV fclt justified and slill do.
It looked likc the traditional Grinnell Spirit was
deceased.

This week it has been different. Beginning with
the annual torchligllt parade, held Thursday night:
Pioneer pep has come back a hundredrfold.

Where only it few helped Meyer and Mandcl'r
fcld root for them last week, almost the entire
student body booked the Pioneers last lli. ht.

TURNER HERE SUNDAY

Governor Don W. Turner is scheduled to
speak at a comllulnity church service at the Con-
gregational church hero at 7:30 tomorrow night,
for the purpose of rccogni ng the _votcl-s of the
community who will cost a ballot for the first time.

Many Students will fall ill this category and
despite party affiliations it would be quite bene-
ficial to rTttcnd the meeting and to hear the first
man of our state talk. Govl Turner has it consider-
able reputation as it Speaker and will he.able to
give an interesting talk. The text of his Speech has
not been announced.

Many people have been cl‘itizing Turner and
his machine and whether we believe the statements
or not we can help our voting ability by hearing
two side, of the Story. Some of us will be voting
for the first time ill our lives and there is no need
to have our unthinking ballot counteract a Sensible
tally, instead of pushing the cause of the majority.
Eyen though we may come away from the meeting
With more decided views for or against Turner he
may be able to help us decide the way we will Voter

DO WE NEED CLASS OFFICERS?
(From The orclglrtoiuan)

Within the next few weeks class elections will be
held separately in each of the six departments of the
university. As usual the elections will be a half-hearted
attempt to elect capable men to the office and a whole
hearted attempt zit playing politics by a few who would
like to be the big shots on the campus.

If the class offices in any department amounted to
anything such a haphazard handling of elections by the
Students Board as was evidenced in the elections last
year, would meet with the immediate disapproval of the
university officials and the student body. Since they
amount to nothing, no one has ccrcol about the handling.

As conditions remain at the present time, there is no
good reason at all why class offices should exist. There
is no single duty that class officers perform and conse-
quently there is no reason why too much emphasis should
be given to such offices. About the only way a majority
of the students at Creighton know that there are such
things as class officers is to see pictures prominently
displayed in the Blucjay each year.

Why such plominence should he given to a person
who has not done one thing to merit such distinction is
beyond all comprehension.

The Ci-cightoniari is strongly in favor of thc discon-
tinuation of all class offices in all departments unless
there are specific duties that such officers perform.

There is a growing agitation for the abolition of non-
pl‘oductivc offices in government throughout the nation.
Students at Creighton could well show initiative in such
an undertaking by making themselves heard on the
question of too many student offices. In the university
it is not 8. question of a saving in the cost of education
as it might be in the nationin cost of Saving the taxr
payers money. but it is a question of a saving in the pay
that most university students get—distinction It might
be wcll to save that distinction and distribute it judici-
ously to the persons who merit it and not spread dis-
tinction promiscously throughout the student body and
thereby make it useless by its over-abundance.

A plan that is in use in many universities is to elect
all-university class officers. At Cmighton such officers
could easily Work in harmony with the students Union
Board of Governors in the handling of student undertak—
ings. In that way the offices would not be superfluous.
There would specific duties for evcry person elected.

There are many elective offices about the university
that deserve the fullest attention of the student body.
The persons elected to those offices should be accorded
all the distinction that they deserve. It is impossible,
however. to feel that a person should be given promin-

,enCe When it is known that he has done nothing to de-

serve it.

Class elections at Creighton have degenerated to
that sort of thing. A reorganization seems to be neces~
sary. The best plan seems to be the all-university offices,
Until that is brought about, Why fool around and make a
fuss over nothing at allithe class officers in each de-
partment?

Thursday

John D, Stoops, professor of phil—
osophy, spoke in chapel, on thc soul.
He compared the orthodox Conception
of the soul. according to which re.
ligion is a consolation for having to
live in this fallen, disappointing
world, and the object of the soul, to
transcend and deny the world, to that
of George Parker of Harvard uni-
vcrsity, who says that modern science
knows where the soul is and gives
it purely physical basis.

Professor Stoops declared that he
himself believed in a soul intimately
connected with the world in which we
live, and dependent upon it for exis<
tence.

Friday

Prof. E. B. T. Spencer of the
Greek department used “Gardening”
as his lecture topic for Friday’s
chapel,

He explained that human lives are
like gardens, and that their owners
should select the best soil, tend the
crops faithfully, and keep the weeds
out just as an expert gardener would
do. ,

“Best results follow only the best
preparation," he declared.

F‘YES, I LIKE

to smoke Granger. I have
tried all kinds of tobacco; but,
frankly, I have never found
any other that is as good as
Granger.

"I think I know something
about tobacco, and I should
say that Granger is the one
tobacco that is made just
right for pipes.”
