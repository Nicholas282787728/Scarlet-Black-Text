sual lightingeitects made in Grinnell
tor some time.

The floods of red, yellow and blue
light played on and of! against strik-
ing black and white design of the Fu»
turistic set, rapidly and smoothly. EVA
,ery new thought and mood oi the play
was emphasized by the heautiiully
shitting play or the color illumina—
tion. Clarence Richards was in charge
or lighting arrangements.

Frances Busby, in the role or “She”
created a lasting ianciiul illusion and
made the one or two somewhat thin
spots in the play interesting by grace—
fully handling situations otherwise
discouraging.

Thomas Burroughs and Alexander
Hollenheck as the “Smge Hand” and
the “Greenwich Village Author”
crowded the iii-st part or the play with
witty by play and oilered an unusual
line of good comedy situation from
the erratic rise of the curtain to their
erratic exits. The comedy with more
or the satire added was well taken up
hy Harold Swanson, in the part or
”He” in some of his ﬂights or poesy,
“He",st times lost his audience in the
manner of most good Futurists, but
on the whole interpreted this most
difﬁcult role with artistry and at all
times with an abundance of life.
Though “The Futurist Without a
Future” can hardly he cataloged otfv
hand as heing a classic in the held of
one act plays, the production last
night showed it to he a timely satire.
brilliantly written, and retreshing in
its unconventionality.

l CYCLONE.

l

I Cyclones lor lllay haslictsl Such
was the expectation oi many on the
campus, but the management or the
stormy book, when interviewed as to
the truth or the rumor, gave the re
porter a sphinxlike reply. The mime
agement smiles smugly and says noth-
Iiug. The smile may he interpretedin
'any way that the public wishes. It
is the opinion or the reporter that
something is going to happen,

When interviewed further, the edie
tor gave a few hints in regard to the
lieutul‘es of the book. The humor sec-
tion is the largest which has ever ap-
peared in a Cyclone, there are more
cuts than have ever been assembled
for a Crinnell year book, and the cove
er—hut here the editor cut short his
remarks. He seemed willing to talk
in superlatives in regard to the book
but the details still remain a mystery.
“When” puts him on his guard. The
business manager also seemed
strangely afflicted with the curse of
dnnibncss the minute the fatal word
was uttered. Attempts to catch those
wily persons oil their guard iailed to
get the desired information.

Speculate, folks, speculate!
