Could you afford to have a
car at Crinnell if the present
rule were not in force?

Bill ingram, north Younker,
junior: “No, 1 most definitely
could not. However, I’m not
against people having one if
they can afford it.”

Barbara nets, Haines senior:
“No, I don’t think I could, as
much as I would like to have
one here."

Jim roster, Smith junior:
”Yes, I suppose 1 could afford
it; however, I doubt if i would
have one.”

In Marine, Main freshman:
“It would depend on what my
parents would say. I think it
would be a fine idea!"

Ken Knntz, south Younker
freshman: “No, I wouldn‘t have
one. And i believe that the rule
should stand as it is, because it
makes things a little more
equal. The car rule was one of
the things which sold my fam—
ily on Grinnell,”

Donna Goetsch, Read sopho-
more: “I don’t think it would be
necessary for a girl to have one,
down here, It might make too1
much of a distinction between
the girls'who could afford one
and those who couldn’t.”

The above question was sub
mitted by Herb Lancaster,
south Younker junior, and was
judged best by Charmaynel
