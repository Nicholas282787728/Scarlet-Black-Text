McGregor To Resign

by an 5&5 staii writer

Student Government Association
president Russ McGregor will re
sign irom that position next week
because of recent “ﬁnancial and
academic dilliculties,” the SﬂtB
learned this week. McGregor told
the StiiB that he is plannlng to issue
an official announcement to that ef-
fect in the Campus Memo next Tues-
day,

Although the response oi soA has
not yet been determined, McGregor
anticipates that the organization will
probably not till the position for the
remainder of the term, which ex,
pires at mid»semester break. He
will be meeting With SGA Vice-Pres-
idents A“; Walter and John Plei-
ten;n g1; adent Coordinator Craig
Kugw Pin the next tew days to
determine the response of the ore
ganization. There is no precedent
tor the current situation,

McGregor won a landslide election
last Spring and has served since
the fourth quarter of the last schr
ool year.

Because he has received low num-
bers of credits tor the past two
semesters he is now in a “credit
deficit," McGregor said, and must
take a large academic load this
semester. Furthermore, he expects
that the search for a solution to
his ﬁnancial difficulties will con-
sume additional time. “It was Just
a question of priorities," he said.

Most oi the work of SGA during
the third quarter or the year, he

said, will center around constitu-
tional revision and an “evaluation
oi the SGA organization.” Although
McGregor expresses regret at his
inability to participate in that eval-
uation, he observes that most ot
the work towards long»range goals
was completed last semester,

”With the amount oi work I had
to do," Mcore or told the 581E,

“SGA could burn me out. There
is no way i could do the type oi
Job 1 think is necessary, and i
don’t think the students should pay
ior someone who would lust be tak-

in during my three quarters inoliice.
Now I have to concentrate on aca-
demics and other immediate per
sonal concerns "

NUMBER [7

Fuel Shortage Hits Grinnell

by John Wylie

Lowered temperatures throughout
the campus provide the primary
evidence that the widely publicized
tuel crisis has reached Grinnell;

Grinnell’s heating plant, which op»
crates interchangeably on natural
gas and number 2 grade iuel oil,
ls unable to Obtain either iuel in
sutticient quantities to maintain nor,
mal heat levels through the winter
season

Public discussion oi the impending
iuel crisis began in Iowa during
the first Week of December. Hows
ever, Physical Plant Director Dale
Hawn received assurances from the
College‘s iuel suppliers that the
problem should not effect Gi'innell
because of its advance planning

The College had contracted withllie
Standard Oil Company tor up to 220,
000 gallons oi «2 grade iuel oil to
be delivered during the 1972»73 heat»
ing season.

Natural gas is supplied to the Cole
lege on an interr
lowa Southern Ut
lege receives gas only alter the
needs of all Grinnell's residential
customers are met.

normally, the heating plant runs
on natural gas exclusively untilaiter
the iirst oi January, Conserving the
supply oi iuel oil and reducingheat-
ing costs, since gas is the cheaper
of the two luels.

However, because ol the subrzero
weather experienced duringtheiirst
weeks of December, the heating plant
had consumed 70,000 gallons oi oil
by December 20.

Based on fuel consumption pro-
jections it was determined that the
College would not have enough fuel
all under its contract with Standard
Oil to last the winter, and that less
natural gas than ever before would
be available to the heating plant,

In a late December meeting, the
college's administration decided to
cut temperatures in as many build~
ings as possible in order to coils
serve iuel

Hawn estimates that the College’s
fuel consumption was cut 23% by
the temperature cuts, As late as
January 7, it appeared that the
fuel Situation was under Control

However, Hawn received a call
January 8 trom Gene Story, stan—
dard Oil's Grinnell representative,
oiiicially serving notice on the
College that standard on could not
luliill its contract,

Standard said it would deliver 52,
500 gallons oi oil during the month
of January; 40,000 tor February;
and ll,000 in March in addition,
the College would iortoit any oil
it was unable touseduringthe month
tor which it was allotted

Later verbal commitments irom
standard will give the college anadr
ditional 16,000 gallons over a two
month period —- still 31,000 gallons
short oi the original quantity pro-
inised.

No Worse
Associate Dean oi the College
James Hamilton and Hawn agree
that the iuel problem will probably
get no worse, Hamilton ilatly de~
nied rumors that the College was

planning to close ior all or part
of February,

Hawn noted that, with the verbal
promises lrom standard oil and
an agreement with Thermogas oi
Iowa, an LP gas supplier, to alter
the heating plant to use LP gas it
necessary, the current tempera—
ture reductions in college build-
ings would probably be suiiicient
to see the Collegethroughthe short-
age.

Both Hamilton and Hawn stressed
cooperation from the campus com-
munity as a key {actor in success-
iully meeting the iuel shortage.

Saving Gas

Natural gas is provided to Hurling
Library and the otf»campus colleges
owned residence houses on a guar-
anteed basis by ISU Hawn noted
that, by resetting the thermostats
in these buildings to the same levels
as those on the rest at the campus,

Youth Fare Picture Cloudy

by an stir stilt writer

Although the iuture oi youth air
fares remains cloudy, with conﬂict
ing reports about whether or notthe
Civil Aeronautics Board will abolr
ish the reduced rates, anationalorr
ganization has already been termed
to support retention oi the discount
lares.

The Civil Aeronautics Board an-
nounced on December 7 its decisin
to abolish youth standby and youth
reserved tares us well as iamily
plan discount fares as “unreason-
able and,..un]llslly discriminatory",
Implementation oi the ruling was
deferred by the Board pending tur-
ther study of the effects the deCiSr
ion will have on regular air (ares.

CAB and Department oi Transporr
tation oliicials have ignored or side-
stepped Sol-3 inquiries about the Dec-
ember ruling, however, and spokesr
men (or several air carriers re
port that they have received no ole
iicial word or the proposed changes.

Ozark Airlines spokesmen in Kan-
sas City told the son late last week
that Ozark had received no oiiicial
report or the ruling, and that line

piementation oi any such ruling
would be some months in the fu—
ture Since the entire domestic rate
structure is currently under review
by the Board.

Jane McCabe of Trans World Aire
lines was more emphatic: “TWA
has absolutely no plans at this time
to cancel its domestic or interna-
tional youth fares”. She added that
TWA had not received any inior-
mation about the proposed change.

Meanwhile, the Coalition to Retain
Air Discount Fares (CARDF) has
been iormed under the sponsorship
of the National Student Lobby and
the Continental Marketing Corpora-
tion to press Congress for legisla-
tion to retain the discounts.

In a statement January 8, the new
organization announced the estabe
lishment oi ottlces in Washington,
D.C. and Houston, Texas and the
beginning oi a nationwide campaign
to solicit letters to Senators and
Congressmen in support oithe youth

ence is planned on February 28 to

College Pub Nears Establishment

by Steve Nunn

Backers of a proposed private pub to be es—
tablished in Gardner Lounge collected 534 stu-
dent signatures this week on a member-shippledge,
with an additional 35 faculty and staff Signatures
The pledge was in response to a request from
college authorities to provide a “student mane
date” [or the pub. Proponents had hoped for 700
signatures, according to SGA VicerPresldent John
Platter.

Another petition, this one opposing a pub inGarde
her, began circulating in Main Hall Tuesday night.
At last report 34 Main residents had Signed.
The petition, which is repinted elsewhere in this
issue of the 3&5 as a letter, objects to the pub
because it will make Gardner unsatisfactory as
a place {or studying and because Main residents
do not want the noise and rowdiness which they
think may result from the pub in and around their
hall.

If approved by the Board oi Trustees, the pub
would be located in the private dining rooms in
Gardner, Meals now served there would be moved
to the Forum at no increase in charge, accord,
ing to SG/i

Plelter, who has been closely involved with the
pub since the idea iirst arose, says he hopes
conditions can be met and the pub opened soon
alter Spring break. it would be open only to mem-
bers and their guests, but anyone in the college
community could tom upon payment ol‘a $1 mem-
hersllip iee. However, members below the minir
mum iowa drinking age (19) could not purchase
or drink any alcoholic beverages.

College administrators and the pubs backers say
the age limit will be entorced, and the pub will
be patrolled ”monthly, weekly or nightly” by town
police, according to Grinnell Police Chief Bill
Peters.

Peters says he will patrol the pub at his dis-
cretion, “Just like any other beer Joint in town,”
and will not need a complaint or an invitation to

do so. He also said the pub will be “patrolled
especially well it there are a lot or lEryearr
Olds in there."

“Let's not kid ourselves, Eighteen-yeareoldswill
not be in there to drink soda pop,” Peters told
the Sth. The pub would lose its license to dis
pense liquor ii minors were found drinking there
repeatedly, said Peters.

Backers oi the pub have asked the college fora

‘$7,000 loan to get it set up. The loan is to be

repaid and the pub is to become a self»supporting,
nonprofit, private corporation which will rent its
space in Gardner irom the college.

"We do not want a rowdy, drunken place," says
Plelier. He said entertainment, both professional
and student, would be of high enough quality that
customers would come to listen, not just to drink.

The pub would offer “a unique atmosphere not to
be found either on campus or in the town,“
Pleller said. Associate Dean James Hamilton,
who undertook a market survey for the Student
Services Committee when it was studying the pub
proposals, says the student drinking trade will
initially be split between town bars, such as the
Longhorn, and the pub, when and ii the latter-
is established. Eventually, however, Hamilton be-
lieves that student business will either go 1.00%
[or the pub or 100% for the town, and he thinks
it will go tor the town because students will
want :i change at enVironment from the campus

l-lztrntlton also said the pub could not maintain
a quiet, colleehouse type atmosphere and make
enough to survive, since the volume of revenue
needed to support the pub would require a bar-
like atmosphere.

Pleiier disputed this, citing the University of
town, which has recently started serving alcor
holic beverages in the Wheel Room of memorial
Union, as an example. Pfeltel" said he has visited
the Wheel Room and found it to be “bustling with
acthity, yet not boisterous or rowdy,” even when
it was filled with a weekend crowd,
