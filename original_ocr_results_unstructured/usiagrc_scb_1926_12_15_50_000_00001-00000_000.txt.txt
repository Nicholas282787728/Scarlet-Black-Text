TRAGES INDUSTRIAL EFFECT

Urnuﬂl (if up Product Industries Is
Diwusscrl; Aluluillulu Alltl Motor
Fuels Pointed Olli-

That the influence of chemistry in
industry is sufficiently great to cause
a New Hampshire manufacturing
plant to become peanut growers on
Florida land, was illustrated by Dr.
Edward Bertow, head of the departs '
ment of chemistry at the University
0! lowo, Mandi—W evening. Dr. Bartow,
speaking on "Chemistry in Industry"
in A. R. H auditorium, was intro-
dued by Dr. L. P. Sherman, beau In.
Grilmell's chemistry department.

Dr, Bar-tow cited ssa specific ins
stance of the growth of the bywmrluct
industries through the development at
chemical processes; the case of the
paper industry. Chlorine is here
used as a bleach, and the excess chlo~
rule which was formerly only a waste
product came to be utilized in the
manufacture of chloroform and care
bon tetrachloride. Along with the
chlorine, hydrogen was produced, and
was discovered to be particularly ef-
ficacious in the hardening‘ol’cerialn
oils as lard substitute Peanut oil
was the best for this purpose, and
consequently the papcr firm branched
out into peanut growers on Florida
land. Thus tho influence of chems<
try on this industry caused at small
paper maufacturing plant to develop
into a comprehensive organization
valued at sevcnty million dollars.

Discu its .llllluilllllll

Similarly, Dr. Barlow stressed the
importance of chemistry to the plum-
iliuni industry and to motor fuels. ‘
"in 1835," said Dr. Bartow, "alum-
inum was value’rl at $250 per Pound.
In 1918, the price had been reducedto
twenty cents. The need for elec-
tri ity in the manufacturing process
has caused an immense development
of water power. The little Tennes-
sce river alone will be made to turn
nish 350,000 horse power for the plant
of the Aluminum company of Amer-
lea.

“Twentyrnine years ago," continued
Dr. Bar-tow, "there were four auto-
mobiles in the world. Now, there are
some twenty million. This is due in.
part to the work of chemistry in ob»
mining motor fuel. Prior to the dis-
covery or the “Cracking” process, on-
ly nine or ten per cent of gasoline
was being obtained from the. petrolr
cum oil, it chemist then predicted
that gasoliuc would very soon rise to
enormous prices. at present, should
sources of petroleum give out, there
have been discovered in Alberta oil
and tar sands which proluisd gasoline
enough to last the world ‘for 150
years."

Dr, Brtl'tou‘ [Old of (I. Copper mine at
Copper-ville. Tennessee, where sill-
phuric acid is beiiig.madc as ii by
product ol thc cooper smelting, and
where the largcst lcad chamber plant
in the world for making sulphuric
llcid is located. Formerly, this was
a waste product, "Now," said Dr. Bar.
tow, “Lila output of copper is limited
by the dcmand for the by-product. For:

eighteen tons of copper, 1200

. of sulphuric acid is produced.
The waste product has become the
product. and the principle product.
