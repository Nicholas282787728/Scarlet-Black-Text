GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

CRA CK-POT

By Ken
Pearce and Mathews

At last Grinnell has produced

a local counterpart or Congress

man Dies. Thc proposed flunk day

caused Professor Conard to label

the Honor ‘G’ club as a sub-

versive element on this campus.
—OH!‘

Famous Last Word - ch Willie
O’Connor to Youngstrom after
the Drake game: “How good a
basketball team do you have to
get around here to get a new
gym?“

ionli
While on the subjects of gyms.
it is interesting to note that THE
Grinnell gym developed a new
large crack the morning before
the Coc game. A conference of
the grounds crew decided
building as safe for the gamc
despite the crack and a capacity
crowd was admitted. Fact is
people were turned away from the
game. and some girls had to sit
on the playing floor proper in
order to see it. Reports have it
that the boys in the press box
were wondering how to file their
gym collapse stories if they them»
selves were buried in the .debris.

Candidly we believe that Grin—
college should be enjoined
from holding any more basketball
games in THE gymnasium. If
the building doesn't fall down
from its own weight most any
day. a good rousing Cheer in
resonance with the present loose
brick should be a good bet {or a
first class disaster.

—OH!7

One campaign is already re-
putedly well under way in the
election of the new prexy. and
rumor has it that this effort will
attempt to demonstrate all the
Seeealled evils of campaigning.
It is barely possible that truth
will be used as a. weapon.

eonli

Since the beginning of the year
the administration has been carry-
ing on a campaign to cut the
collegc electricity bill in the
dorms and the quad. Why then
don't the powers-that-he put in
force a late campus blackout?
It is getting so now that it
doesn't pay for a dormite to walk
a date home after dark with the
present campus illumination.

701-137

Who dreamed up the regular
Lhrec»hour early afternoon morae
toiium on the White House? IS
it that the social problem is not
present at that time, or does it
take three hours to clean out the
morning cigarette stubs and coke
bottles?
