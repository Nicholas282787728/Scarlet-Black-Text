Behz’ Sickness Throws Feeling
of ‘ Uncertainty Into
Local Camp.

HAS BEEN PLAYING GOOD
BALL ALL THIS SEASON

Trainload of Rooters May Come
With Drake Squad — Will
Crowd Gymnasium.

Calamity broke forth in the Pioneer
.camp Thursday when Freddie Benz
who has been an important factor in
the Grinnell play since he became
eligible, was mken to the hospital,
The nature of his illness has not been
determined.
Benz will not be able to participate
in the closingcontest of the season
, with Drake here iionday, it is thought
‘nnd his loss win be a severe blow to
, the Pioneer strength.
Out for Ilevengc
‘The Pioneers are out to close the
season‘by‘xevcnging the 19 to 18

beating handed them by the Bulldogs[

Tuesday. The feeling is general that
the Crinnell five was badly outlucked
in the firstvDrake battle, and every—'
body is strong for a come—back.
' There is no doubt that Drake has
a dangerous aggregation. They play
ed fast basketball all the._wa‘y in
’ Tuesday's contest, and they are es—
pecially dangerous on long shots
when their opponents are guarding
closely under the basket. Payseur,
Ebert; and Shawver count it good per-r
oentage of-long tries that most teams
do not even attempt. The construc-
tion of their home floor has made.
them profiClerrt in this style of play.
As a result or Benz' absence, Evans
and Whitchill will probably hold down
the torward positions. If Macy should

start-at guard, Wassenaar might get,

a chance at a forward position.
jLost Guide for Pioneers
Monday's game will close the sear
son for the Pioneers, with
Waseenaar, and Captain Evans wea-

' ing tb’e Scarlet and Black on a liaslrct— 1

ball court for the last time.
‘ that the game closes the season
should bring out a. large crowd,
'Rumors have come from Des
Moincs that Drake is trying to a
range for a special to' bring
motors to Grinnell to back their team.

' Grinneu Not Alone
In Need of Money

Harvard Corporation Finds In-
crease in Tuition Needed.

HARVARD UNIVERSITY, Cam
bridge, Mass, March 11.—A general
increase in tuition fees at the Univerr
sity, made necessary by increased
expenses, has been voted by the Cor-
poration and Baal-dict Overseers on
the recommendation of a committee
representing the Corporation and the
various faculties.

"In the College, the Engineering
school, the Graduate School of Archi—
tecture, the School of Landscape,
Architecture, and the Bussey Institu»
tion, the tuition fee is raised from
$200 a year to $250, eliectlve next
September for all students.

Increase Loans

The stipends for scholarships will
be increased at the same time so as
to impose no hardship on needy Studs
cuts of scholarship caliber. The total
amount available noW in‘ scholarships
and other aids in the College alone
will thus be raised to considerably
more than $150,000 a year,

The tuition in the Graduate School
of Business Administration will go up
from $250 to $400. This is expected
to put this school on a nearly self
supporting basis together with the
present endowments. Scholarships
or student loans are also available
for this School, and it is thought that
the increased business training and
earning power Students will derive
from this course will enable them to
easily pay back borrowed money.

The increase was made necessary
by a deficit of $151,000 last year and
an expected deficit of $300,000 this

Paulu Wins 300 Yard Dash at
Urbana — Prospects Good for
Winning Season.

Paulu's winning of the 300 yd dosh
at‘ur-bana last Saturday in 33 flat not
Lonly officially opened the Pioneer-
ltrack season, but it was the greatest
win in Grinnell track history since
Karl Haas took the special 100 yd.
dash at Drake in the 1919 relays.
Paulu was entered against the lastest
field of sprinters that the middle west
‘could produce and despite this fact
Paulu won his race in easy fashion.
Undoubtedly ‘,"l30c" Huff has develoov
ed in Paulu a sprinter of the highest
caliber. '
‘ Locnl Prospects Good

In general the local track prospects
are good. There is still a lack of runs
Iterial, especially in the longer races
Zbut Coach Hull believe that with the
aid of good outdoor conditions and
consistent training on the part of the
squad Grinnell will have a well bal-
Ianced, team. , '

The squad is doing the hardest sort
of training now and have been able to
work outside during the past week.
‘If the weather remains nice the Pio-
neer squad will be in mid season form
.eren before the first meet. It is ex—
pected that Captain Evans will report
to the squad soon after the close of
the basket ball season.

Home Meet Postponed

It has not yet been officially ans
pounced when the Drake Relay try-
outs will take place but they Will'
probably be held the Saturday pre—
ceedipg the Relays, which are sched-
uled for April 23. The Home meet
that; been postponed until April 30 be-
cause of the dropping or negotiations
with Nebraska for a dual meet on that
This arrangement will enable
Coach nut: to send Pnulu to the Penn
Relays at Philadelphia without ham-
pering the varsity.

FORUM-PHI DELPH
TO PRESENT PLAY

"Alice - Sit - by - Misfire” Barrie
Comedy Chosen.

“Alice-Sitsby-tbeali‘ire,” by J. M.
Barrie is the play which has been Se»
looted by Forum and Phi Deth lit-
erary societies to be presented by
them at the Colonial April 30. There
are three men and five women in the
case, which will be picked as soon as
the manuscripts arrive.

“Alice- l -bYrtllc~Fire" is a. dclight~
flll three-act comedy of English mall-
ners. The emotional Amy, through a
sudden and intensive exposure to the
theatre, has acquired a very “French
novel” attitude toward lile, which she
proceeds to apply to her mother the
moment the latter appears after a.
sojourn of many years in India. As-
suming the role of the ultrarl'omantic
heroine, Amy pilots the various rep-
utations of the family on Do a. reef,
from which the equally romantic
mother, Alice, is able to rescue them,
as she for the first time assumes the
responsibility of mothering her fame
ily. The [lltty will be under the di-
rection of .1. P. Ryan.

Do your trading at Blair's store
next Thursday and Friday and help
out the endowment fund. 10% of all

It is probable that the violin is the
same one used by Maude Powell in her
appearance here in 1918.

Local musicians are awaiting with
great interest the coming of the young
artist, who created such a sensation
at her debut in New York last Novem-
her. She was acclaimed by the leading
critics its greatest woman violinist
heard for in by years in New York, if
not the greatest ever heard. She is at
{mph of Sevcik in Vienna At the age
of eleven she was engaged as soloist
by such conductors as Arthur lesck

Famous Serbian Coming to Speak
on Reconstruction in
Europe. “

IS WELL KNOWN AUTHOR
0N RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS

Thru the efforts of the Macy club,
Grinnell college and community will
hear one of Europe's greatest orators
and writers, Bishop Nikolai Vilinliv
rovic of Serbia, who will speak Tues—
day evening, March 15 at seven o’clock
in Herrick chapel, on “Reconstruction
in Europe." Bishop Nikolai, as he is
familiarly called, is touring America
at the present tirnc,'lceturing belore
the leading churches, universities, and
colleges at the invitation of the Insti-
tute of International Education and
the Iicderal Council of Churches or
Christ in America.

Is Lender

HC is heralded in this country and
abroad as one of the foremost men of
the time. The son of a Serbian peas-
ant, educated in the schools of his
country and later in the universities
of Switzerland, England, Germany and
Russia, he emerged into public ac—
claim as one of the most distinguished
prelates of the Eastern Orthodox
Church. Few are as well fitted to dis—
cuss‘the period of continental recon-
strucuon, for in his native Serbia he
has taken a leading role in post-war
activities. Bishop Nikolai, according
to press comment from eastern cities
in which he has lectured. speaks flu-

‘ept English and is an author of no

ittle note. Best known or his books
are “Life of Christ," "Thoughts of
Serbia," and "Serbia in Light and
Darkness."

Characteristic of the favorable com-
ment which he has aroused in every
quarter is the statement of Edward

arshall, Amer-loan journalist, who
says, "He is the biggest man I met
in Europe," and the opinion voiced
by the Outlook: “As a writer, orator,
and theologian he stands pro-eminent
among his countrymen."

This is to be an open meeting of
the Macy club; all other colege lunc—
tions [or this date have been postpon-
ed, '

Three Clubs Plan Beneﬁts This
Week — Tucker Recital
Attracts Notice.

Women's clubs are to be‘ busy this
week earning their pledges towards
the endowment fund. Tonight Pro-
fessor Larell, authority on Italian art,
will lecture on "The Painters of Ven-
ice", Herrick chapel, 3:00 o'clock.
The Arts Study club is to benefit from
this lecture, for which Professor lo.-
vell is donating his time. An admis—
sion of twenty—five cents is to be
charged at the door, ,

The.coming of Mrs. Collingwood—
Tucker Wednesday for the EntreNous
club tea-musicals is also attracting
much attention. Mrs. Tucker is an in-
terpreter of negro tunes and folk—
songs, and is probably the foremost
interpreter of the negio melodies of
anyone in the country.

To Mrs. Collingwood-Tucker belongs
the distinction ot being the one per-
son in this country who has seriously
undertaken to preserve negro folk-
songs and she is doing it in an in»
describably charming way.

Descendsd from a long line of
Southern ancestors, she‘has an un»
dcrstanding of the negro and the en-
vironment under which he lived in
the south which enables her to vise
ualizc the old mamlny as she croons
her baby to sleep, and brings back
the campvmeeting of the old South
where the uegroes “got 'ligion" and
sang their weird old spirituals, whose
melodies doubtless hark back to un
believably ancient days in the heart
of Africa.

The Grinnell Women’s club will
have complete charge of stairs Dl'Yv
goods store Thursday and Friday of
next week, and will receive 10% of
all sales, and 5% of all collections
made during the day, the proceeds to
go towards $2,000 pledge oi the club
for the endowment.

Both Teams Lose Decision by Two
to One Count — Cornell
Wins Two Debates.

AFFIRMATIVE TEAM IN
STRONG DEBATE HERE

Gives Cornelﬁead With Carleton
Second. in Three-Cornered
Standing.

Grinucll lost both debates last
night in the Grilllleleral‘leton-Cornell
triangular, one from Corncll, on the
local platform, and one from Carle- ‘
ion at Northfleld. Both decisions were
two to one in favor of the opponents.
The negative team, composed of Pol'»
tcr, '2l, Vogler, '22, and Barnes, '23,
debated at Carleton, and lost the de
cities in a close word battle. ‘-

Egloff, '23, Rowlinson, '22, and ,Mc-’
Donald, '21, allirming for Grinnell the
proposition, "Resolved that the Esch-
Cummius plan is a desirable solution
of the railroad problem" lost by‘ a
two to one vote for the Cornell nega-
tive team, composed of Hunt, Shoes,
and saute. Constructive speeches
were all twelve minutes in length and
the men spoke tor their ’respective

‘teams in the order mentioned. Prof.

J. D.‘ Stoops presided with Prof. E. W, .
Peterson of Iowa University ‘and
Profs. G. H. Von Tuugelen and Stalk '
ley Boroucki of Iowa State ,a‘cting as
judge. The character of the debate'
merited a much larger audience than
it received. , ,

Egloff, leading out for Grinnell,
presented the case of the affirmative
as follows: The EschrCummins bill
is a desirablc solution of the railroad
since it is (1) the logical outgrowth
of our past inilroad legislation, (2)
sound.in practice, (3) and sound in
principle. Hunt lollowed for the peg»' .
ative with its objections to the meas-
ure, stating that it does not take care‘
of the weak roads, guarantee maxi»,'
mum sci-vice, eliminate waste and
abolish extreme decentralization.

Get Off Sobicct,

In rebuttal the Grinnell team was
drawn away from the subject in baud
to a squabble over compulsory arbi—
'tration and consolidation, the desir—
ability of w rch they practically ad-
mitted in their first two speeches.
Altho McDonald in the final speech of
the debate made a noble attempt to
swing the this in favor of Grinnell, be
was unablerto show that, since the
Esch-Cunimins bill was working well
in actual practice without enforced
arbitration and consolidation, those
two questions were irrelevant to the
proposition.

The Cornell affirmative team, de-
bating the Carleton negative team at
Mt Vernon also won a decision, giv-
ing Cornell two wini. Carleton one
win and one lose, and Grinnell two
loses. ‘
