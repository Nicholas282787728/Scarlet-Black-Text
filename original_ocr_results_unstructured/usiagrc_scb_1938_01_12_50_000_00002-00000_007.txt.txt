Post Box Romance
And a Test for True Love

A lot of publicity and very little ro-
mance was started when R. M, Brandin
and w. A. Gilrcy (at [am began Prince-
ton’s Lonely Hearts Club. When they
advertised in the Vassar newspaper, "Hun-
dreds of men are lonely in Princeton. Are
you lonely, too? Find your post-box lover
by writing the Lonely Hearts Club," they
received stacks of responses. But Vassar
venuses (below) claim it was all in fun
and are shown giving the razzberry to the
melancholy Tigers. Meanwhile, University
of Taledo’s Edmund Keefer (right) in-
vented a "cupidoseope” which allegedly
rests "true love.” The prospects for marri-
mony hold hands, hold electrodes on the
machine, and a meter tells them whether '
or nor they should proceed with the aifair.
