" t opportunity will be given to

meetings and Monday’s chapel pro-
gram will be aids in preparing the
ground for the opening of the
monster campaign.

All Presidents llieet

at a meeting of presidents or
every organization in college and
three faculty representatives Mon-
day evening the proposition rvas
tlroroly discussed and was under»
taken as an all college project. An
executive committee was elected to
handle the details of the campaign.
it includes Eber Palmer, chairman,
Addison Sprinkle, Cress Hoyt, M.
Haas, Maurice Fridlund, Toinette
Swan, Rena. Schut, and Helen Rob»
inson.

The campaign rvili be handled
strictly as an ail-college affair by
the committee instead of by the Y.
M. or Y. w. c. A.

"Support The Team"
The sentiment of Monday’s meet-
.ing was expressed in a resolution

urging every student in college to
support the football team and go
to the [own game, provided he could
do that and also support the bigger
gaure, the war relief work. This
resolution aimed to correct the ims
pression that had started that this
campaign intended to hinder in any
way the support of the Griunell
eleven.

Monday’s meeting was one of the
most distinctive ever held in Grin-
nell. Hall a hundred of the lead<
ers of the college assembled to dis
cuss and act upon the report of
the Grinnellians that weirt to Des
Moines last week to the statewide
convention which considered and
planned iowa's part in the war res
lief. Every side of the local prop-
osition was hit upon by the stur

' dents.
' “This is liiggost Thing"
"This is the biggest thing the
college as a unit ever tackled,"
Dennis Kelley declared in his talk.

Coach Joiics informed his team
Wednesday night that “no inch is
eligible for this team unless he will
come back and fight. The 1917

the biggest in the history of the
university. They even rveirt so far
as to resurrect the snake dance, a
