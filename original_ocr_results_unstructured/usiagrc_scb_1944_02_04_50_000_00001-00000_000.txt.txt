Word

The cancellation or these units
‘lis a result of a national liquir
Idation of similar units. As yet
‘nu Ilolicc whatever has been re-
wired concerning the
future of the engineering units.
in the article in The New York
Times, Jan. 30 Benjamin Fine
said the selective service division
at Washington announced that
“the Army Specialized Training
program would be reduced from
a high of 144,000 to 125,000 stu-
dents, the latter figure to he
reached by April 1. The total
number, however, may be re:
duced or increased at any time,
depending upon the Army's need
for technical specialists."

Fine continues; “Although the
Army training program is less
than a year old, 10,000 students
’have already completed the
course and have been assigned to
Army commands in all parts of
the world. By the end of June
50,000 men will have completed
their tl'all‘rllig’.

“Because of the reduced iiuine
ber of men to be tr 'ned during
the coming months, the intake
rate of new candidates will drop
considerably. Hon-ever, no stu-
dent now in lllc ASTP and doing
satislactory work will be let
out."

The article also explains the
new regulations restricting the
number of deferments to be
given college students which will
be in effect Feb, 15. Many ed»
ucators fear, Fine says, that
higher education institutions will
facc a difficult strugglc for
Aval-etime existence if student
bodies are further depleted.

immediate

President Stevens said of Grim
hell, “I plan to maintain a bad-
anced student body, filling the
quadrangle and no more. In the
instance that we have a year
with no army units on the cam-
pus, I shall use that year to

make necessary physical adjust~
merits in the donniboi-ies.

“Should Real] Hall nut be oc—
cupied by an AST unit next
year, Blem's, RIM“, and Cleveland
will he freshman cottages and
Janus, ﬂames, and Reﬁll will
house iniperolassinen." '
