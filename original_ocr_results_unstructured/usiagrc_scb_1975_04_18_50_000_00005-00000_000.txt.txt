3 Conference

To the Editor: '

I want to encourage everyone to
participate in the Transcendental
Meditation and Science of Creative
Intelligence Symposium coming up
this weekend.

More than just lectures, it’s
hoped that people will participate
and interesting discussions will
result. To further encourage

' rapport and good communications
between speakers and audience,
several informal discussion groups
are planned in addition to the
lectures.

Some oi the lectures should be
excellent, and this is an op-
portunity not likely to soon be
repeated at Grinnell. For example,
Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Prof.
Alexander M, Hankey of Maharishi
International University, who
holds a PhD. from MlU and has
done postdoctoral work at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator, will
speak on “Symmetries in Art and
Science”, He will be followed by
Robert Winquist, vicevpresident ot
Mlu, who will speak on
“Rediscovering the Lost
Dimension in Education”. The
Saturday program will include a
Regional Lecturer on Tran—
scendental Meditation and SCI,
and a videotaped lecture by the
first physicist to conduct a coma
parison oi SCI and the quantum
vacuum state in physics, There are
many other speakers and
programs,

You should have received a
schedule in your mailbox. It you
haven't, they’re posted
everywhere.

1 encourage you to attend.

A modest
proposal

To the Editor:

In light of the upcoming SAGA
fast, it might be useful for SGA and
the College Community to
reexamine the College's policy
towards fertilizer usage on the
campus grounds.

The recent action by President
Turner in which fertilizer use has
been curtailed is a step in the right
direction. However, this effort does
not help the people who really need
it, At the recent Food Conference,
the experts reiterated that
reducing food consumption and
fertilizer usage were meaningless
gestures. The rationale behind this
thought is the knowledge that in a
capitalist economy, if people eat
less, then larmers will produce
less. The same relationship applies
to the production and consumption
of fertilizer. Consequently, the
people who are starving do not
receive any relicl, because they
don’t have the money to pay for the
surplus food.

Hopeiully, President Turner will
donate the savings that the College
will receive by its fertilizer cut-
back to a charitible organization
that will provide food or fertilizer
to the most needy countries. l hope
the President will adhere to his
own guidleiness: “We must ask
Whether our motivation is
grounded in basic humanitarian
concerns, or is politically founded.
,. and whether we have heard and
respected the voices with the
competence to speak on the
matter." (8&3 3-7-75.)

Perhaps, we should iollow
SAGA’s example of rehating their
savings to a charitable
organization via SGA, and put our
money where our mouth is.

It is the 1976 Academy Awards,
and the iamily is sitting in lront oi
the fireplace dutiiully watching the
Zenith Chromacolor, Sir Laurence
Olivier himself is about to present
the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian
Award. it is at this pointwe join the
proceedings:

ULIVlER: Tonight we honor
someone whose contributions to
the lilm world are practically
infinite. He’s no longer with us, but
his legacy will live iorever. Aside
from making every movie ever
made, he also has made several
tilm appearancesihis debut in
“King of Kings" (film clip of Judas
lscariot looking up at an inclement
sky and than hanging himself)—'
“The Bible", ”The Robe", “The
Greatest Story Ever Told” (cut to
film clip or Max von Sydow on the
cross, saying “Why hast thou
forsaken me'!” and then dying),
and, of course, his greatest rule7
“The Ten Commandments" (cut to
Charlton Heston with thousands of
followers Standing on the shore of
the Red Sea, Suddenly the sea
parts, fallowing Heston and his
followers to escape from the
pursuing Egyptians. As the
Egyptians enter the path
miraculously created, the water
engulfs them, killing all of them.
Light applause.) And those were

Editor's N0tc~Tlle following
letter is from Una Williams who
along with her husband Tony own
the Gables Guest House in
Wcobley, England, where the three
Grinncll students mentioned in her
letter lived for 3 weeks The three
participants in in the Grinnell-in-
London program were conducting
n community study for an an-
thropological course with Prof.
Caulkins on “British Villages",

On the 12th of November 1974,
our home was invaded by three or
Uncle Sam’s daughters. Life will
never be the same again‘ For the
iirst low days of their five-week
stay, we were all very polite to
each otlier~the 'sizing up' process,
one might say. Then gradually the
ice melted, we all relaxed. and the
enjoyment began, We have never
answered to many questions in our
lives beiore, and I am sure many oi
the Weobiey inhabitants are
unaware that their ramblings are
printed tor posterity in Grinnell's
library!

Privately, l labelled ‘my’ girls,
Ginny the Quiet One, Cathy the
Thinking One and Janet, the
Bubbly One.

Our village, Wcobley, is a small
community of about 800 people.
Mostofthe houses in the old part of
the village are black-and-white
timbered dwellings dating back to
the Xthh and XVth century, and
the church of St Peter and St. Paul
is part Norman.

Ginny, Cathy and Jan threw
themselves into village life with
surprising speed and case. They
almost lmedlately received many
invitations. To a meal, to a

Funicellos , . . (Light laughter) but
then, who’s perfect! (loud
laughter. ) Ladies and Gentlemen,
the Academy proudly presents the
Jean Hersholt Humanitarian
Award posthumously to God. (wild
applause, cheers, whistles).
VOICEOVER: Accepting the
award for God is his son. Jesus
Christ. (Audience rises to ieet,
chanting “Bravo!" Christ walks
out, wearing a light blue brocade
tux, matching satin bow tie, and
sandals. He reaches the podium
and shakes hands with Olivier. Sir
Laurence steps back, leaving
Christ at the podium trying to calm
down the audience. Failing in his
attempts, and being the great
showman he is, he turns the pitcher
of water on the podium into wme.
This wins laughs and yet more
cheers, but the crowd finally
settles down. The audience seated,
Christ begins:)

CHRIST: Well, it‘s Oscar time
againwr, as we call it in Heaven,
Passover! (large laughs, ap-
plause) i wanna tell you, though,
you folks have got the wrong idea
about heaven~you know, that it’s
some big place up in the sky where
people get drunk and do nothing all
the time—kind of like the Senate!
(large laughs, applause). Well, 1
just wanna tell you you’re wrong.
Yeah~l~leaven’s a pretty small
place, in tact, it's so small you
have to step outside to change your
mind! (laughs irom galleryl.
Reallyi'it’s so small that even the
cheruhim have round shoulders!
(more laughs). Gotta lot of poor
angels up there too. Just on my
way here tonight, a seraph stopped
me in the Elysian Fields and said,
“Christ, help me—l haven’t had a
bite in three weeks!” So l bit himl

plause). Yeahisaw another

them to their hearts. The British
reserve was not in evidence, What

Christ, help me. Can you give me a
dollar for some ambrosia?” So I
said, “Let me See the ambrosial”
(moans from audience). on,
yeah—Well, let him who is without
sin cast the first stone! (moans
turn into cheers, audience
responds wildly. Christ waits out
the tumult). But seriously, this is a
solemn occasion. Had Dad been
here, he would have thanked a lot
more people than I can, but i’ll try
anyway, To Cecil B, DeMille, who
showed Dad as he liked to be seen;
to Charlton Heston, (or doing all
that is humanly possible to portray
Dad~and who is welcome up there
anytime (chuckles trom audienr
cc); to the scriptwriter5#
Matthew, Mark , Luke, John—oh,
and how could I forget Paul—and,
of course to all of you at the
Academy (applause). l‘d like to
take this opportunity to announce
that Dad’s tinal iilm—or, rather,
the lastone in which he appeared»
“Armageddon”—is ready ior
release, and you’ll be able to see it
soon at a theatre near you. (Ooh
and ahs from audience, turning
into sustained applause, Christ
waits it out.) Well, I’d like to stay
around awhile, but duty calls. So, if
someone would call me a chariot . .

OLIVIER: 0.K., you’re a chariot!
(wild laughter, cheers, applause).
CHRIST: Thank you all very
much. (turns, begins to leave.
Audience rises, cheering and
yelling ”More! More!”
Tremendous applause, Christ
walks back to podium, \vaveszl
Thank you! Thank you! You're a
helluva audience! (does Stan
Laurel double-take, turns, walks
off talking with Olivier to wild
applause, laughter,’ cheers. Fade

arm's length we maV avoid the
anxieties that often come with
close involvement. But by the

rewards that come wtlh deep

We certainly hope our friendship
