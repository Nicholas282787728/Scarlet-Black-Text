Students, administration
define self-governance

With high numbers of alcohol-related incidents, concerns
raised about student behavior, administration response

rivjerr RADERSTRONG

on the night ofSaturday, August 30, several
students were in Younker Lounge at the annual
"Gerbil Fest" when the new Dean of Students
Travis Greene walked into the lounge. Greene
told the organizers to dispose ofa highly alcoe
holic drink mix and start carding students.

With four new RLCs, a brand-new Dean
of Students position and last-year’s departure
of formereVice President Tom Crady, Student
Affairs looks very different than it did a year
a o.
g Greene and another member of Student
AffairsiNorth East RLC Chris Bylone~
were involved in incidents at onscampus par
ties the first weekend after classes began. The
actions of the administration during and after
the parties, especially in regards to alcohol use
age, have caused concern that new faces in Stri—
dent Affairs may bring a change of policy on
self-governance.

Before Greene arrived at the Younker party
around 9:00 pm, there had already been a dis-
cussion between the Smounker RLC, HSC
and the party organizer Gary Kahn '09 about
discrepancies between the lounge and alcohol
contracts and the party irselt Most notably, the
alcohol contract stated that beer would be the
only alcoholic drink served.

Greene said he told the party organizers
to remove the “jungle juice" and card students.
Greene said he left to visit that night's Hare

ris party before he could conﬁrm the juice was
moved, but students at the party said they were
still shocked at Greene's appearance.

The appearance of administration at a stu—
dcnkmn lounge parry spread quickly among
students. “Students feel more violated when
it [administration presence] happens in the
dorms," said John Burrows '10, SGA VP of
student Affairs. "They view that as a personal
space."

Greene said he will quickly dispel any worry
about changes in administration's policy to-
wards students. “Self governance is alive and
well,"Greene said, “I want eople to feel, in ese
sence, that they own [theitlpcampus,"

On the same night as “Gerbil Fest", an inn
tervention at a party in Rose Lounge by Bylone
brought police and paramedics to campus after
Bylone called 911 for an intoxicated student.
No arrests were made, biit there were citations
for underage drinking.

After Saturday night, students responded
with concern, and Bylone, who declined to
comment for this article and referred the 859’}?
to Greene, sent out an e-mail to his student staff
to clarify his position on issues involved in the
Rose lounge incident, such as alcohol contracts
and lounge usage He said he did not seek out
the party, but saw it from across Mic field.

Bylonc defined what he thought was his
duty as an RLC after the incident, "I am not

and is expected to be completed by the spring of
2010.Tlie library, which was financed through a
sales no increase voted for by Grinnell citizens,
will be in environinciinillyrcorriricd building
that will sit on land donated by the college on
Park Street and Fifth Avenue.

The Drake Library will replace the stcwe
.iir Libiiiy, which was built in 1901. According
to Giinnell Librarian Lorna Caulkins, the new
libiniy is product of n 1999 neetls assessment,
which outlined the kind oflibr‘ ' iinnell tee
quired. “[The] needs assessment indicated that
we necdied] about tlii , times as much space
for a community our srzc,"Ciuilkins said

library came from within the community. “Vi/e
