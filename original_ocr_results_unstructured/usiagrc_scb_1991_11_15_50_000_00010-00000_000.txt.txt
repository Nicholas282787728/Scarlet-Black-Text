RELIGION: Students

tual, stupid, suffering, scary, prude,
crazy and hypocritical.

While Grinnell prides itself on
being tolerant, all we have seen in
these attacks is bigoted intolerance.
This presence of bigotry is evidence
of a double standard among those
Grinnell students who choose not to
let Christianity stand on its own with
out the infliction of the world’s ste-
reotypes, We are not condemning
anyone for their opinions or com-
merits,andnodefenseshouldbetaken.

world in the same way Christ docs.

In each of my annual affirmative
action reports of recent years, I have
noted the low numbers of minority
faculty and administrative staff and
the need for strong and creative ef—
forts in improving this situation. As
the writer reported, initiatives are
being taken to do just that, but the
problem is notat all an easy one. And
assuredly I don’t believe, therefore,
that we have made “significant
progress" in resolving it.

writing a lab report on research
already done on the subject in ques—
lion.

Lopatto claimed that no one has
ever refused to do one of his labs. He
believesthatstudentswhoarestrongly
opposed to animal research do not
take psychology classes, for they
know animal labs arerequisite within
the department.

DeLongsaid he received very few
complains concerning animal re-
search in the Biology Department.
LikeGibson,heasserledthatthecorn-
plaints were mainly in the form of
questions, and were resolved with a
simple discussion of the facts of the
experiment. He stated that there was
an insulnce in which some students
would rather nothave dissected fetal
pigs, but that he did not know how
that situation was ever resolved. He
also recalled some students being un-
comfortablcwith the dissection ofthe
cockroaches, but he again called that
an issue of value judgment; “if you
can step on them in the hall,” he

speculated, what is wrong with dis t
secting and learning from them in the
laboratory? ’

Gibson and Lopatto cited thisas more
evidence of the research animal's
well-being at Grinnell College.

“We take pretty good care of our
animals,” said Gibson.

Whether or not one agrees with
this statement, the topic of animal
research at Grinncll is open for de—
bate. Some believe professors are re-
quiring their students to perform ex-
periments that a number of campus
members consider unethical. These
students want an alternative to the
objectionable material so they can
further their education without com»
promising their principles. But the
professors do notconsrder their prac-
tices unethical, and neither do their
professional contemporaries. Is it an
issue ofpersonal vs. professional ethr
ics? Which is more important to
Grinnell College?

a leader willing to redefine the rela-
tionshipbetweenlhegovemmentand
the governed, and how that is what is
needed today. That desire is made
clear with the powerful support of
issues such as national health care
and better education. These are not
party issues but human issues of a
population wanting a government that
will seem concerned andwill provide
them with the direction they need.

“We can’t turn it off,” Lib re-
minded me. as we pulled in.

“Hmmm,"lsaid.“SoIguesswe’ll
have to fill it running.”

“Canyoudothaﬂlalwaysthought
that makes the car blow up."

“This isn’t Starsky and Hutch or
CHIPS: nothing’s going to blow up.”

“It’s illegal, though, isn't it?"

“So is deserting a vehicle on the
interstate," I pointed out.

“I think it'll be all right," Sharla
assured us. "One of my friends ﬁlled
it up running once. Nothing hap—
pened."

“Atleastifitdoes,it’sabormwed

friends backed away, giving me and

Gingerly, I poked the fuel pump
into the Side of the car and leaned
back, wonderingifloughtto take the
precaution of shielding my eyes
against any potential explosion. Ac»
tually, l reasoned, if the car blows up
I might as well see it happen. It’s not
every day you get to see a fiery in—
femo erupt within arm‘s reach, at
least not in this country.

Butamazingly,nothinghappened.
The tank filled up, the pump snapped
off, and that was that. So if anyone
ever encounters the same dilemma, it
is possible to ﬁll lhe tank while the

car's mnning. I'm sure it’s frowned
upon by the feds, but no petrol cop
leapt out to seize me from behind a
nearby gas pump, camouﬂaged as
oneof those cheap, free Coke glasses
that come with a fillrup.

Anyway, theborrowed car made it
there in time for the concert, and we
got to see a Bob Dylan who was so

and forgota couple ofpertincntstan-
zas in various songs he‘s been singr
ing forZO years. lhalfexpccted Dylan
to say, ”This one’s for the kids from
Iowa that drove here in that borrowed
car they couldn‘t turn of but he
didn’t. The closest he came to that
was to yell, “Everybody must get
stoned! Everybody must get
smashed!” at the audience after
“Rainy Day Women.” He might not
have been addressing us directly,but
we took it to heart as quality advice
from One Who Knows and followed
it up after the show.

After all, if you fall into the habit
of taking things too seriously, you
might find yourself looking down the
barrel ofa gun at your physics prof.
