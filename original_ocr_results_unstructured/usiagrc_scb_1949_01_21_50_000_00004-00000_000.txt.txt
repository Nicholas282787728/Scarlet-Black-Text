In Dining Rooms
Shows Real Spiril‘ .

Last night’s “dinner time pep
rally." a spirited affair attended
by President Stevens. Dean Duke,
Mr. Joseph Charlton. Coach
Pfrtsch, and members of the var-
sity basketball team. was an ex-
hibition of which we all should he
proud. The support given the team
conclusively proves one thin
Grinnell has achieved the much-
sought "school spirit." |

In Cowles dining room. Honori
G President Stew Richmond in-§
troduced Dcan Duke. then Mr.
Charlton, each of whom made
statements to the effect that
“Grinnell has the finest spirit"
they have ever seen.

The team was divided into two
groups. one appearing in Cowlos.
the other in the Quad dining room.
Earl Peisner spoke to the men.
while Glenn Saunders had the
honors over on South campus.
These two men were elected co-
eaptsins for tonight’s game.

Marge Webster, League Board
president, introduced President ste-
vens in the Quad dining room. The
President joined in the spirit of the
thing. when he come forth withv
two promises. 1) To buy Coach
Pfitsch a shiny new pair of sneak-
ers if Grinnell whips the invading
Lawrence team tonight. The shoes
are to be used by the youthful.
mentor when he assumes his du-l
ties as tennis coach this spring.
2) He offered a new sombrero to
the player making the most free
Lhrows in tonight's encounter. The
lid. incidentally. is to be the “best
one I can buy." declared smiling
President Stevens.

All in all. the impromptu affair
was the biggest thing to hit either
dining room sln<e the installation
of punching tinie~clccks. Seriously,

' th team‘s hard work and the no-
ti sole results are worthy of
nothing but our complete support.
Let's turn not en masse tonighti

hind them.

with us!

Every year when nice weather:
comes and everyone is beginning
to feel happy. the foul smel-‘
ling. dirty, yellow water returns
to plague us. The color is repul-
sive enough to make us threaten‘
to give up baths forever. but Hunt
is not enough—the stuff smells;
worse than the meat loaf we are‘
served in the dormitories. l

There are rumors that the stuff;
is taken directly from Arbor lakeu
but that is quite improbable forl
the water in Arbor lake IODkSl
quite clean in comparison withl
ours.

Also, Arbor lake never smelled
as bad as this does.

There is another school of
thought prevalent—that the water
is colored by the pipes. The only
trouble with this theory is that
the pipes are certainly very scl—
ﬁsh to discolor the water only in
the spring.

No remedies are ever suggested.

to suggest remedies for somethingi

l I think everyone has noticed thc encouraging spirit of the basket-
ball team. the spectators and the faculty up to this point, Last sot-
lurrlay's exhibition of support was by far the best 1 have seen in

this school.

Beloit showed the rest of thel
conference some of their power
this past week \V en they ﬁan-i
qllci'cd Monmouth 6 17, and then
lilu cd lioine Lo massacre Knox
.111-41. thus cstablisliing a new
lconfercnne record which. I feel
;safe to say. will linger just all
iIlLLle while. in the books of thc‘
lMidwesL conference. Johnny 0r-r-
land Ron Bontenips, Belch": high

scoring duct, have averaged 19,
points in their three confel'encel
outings so for this season. i

incidentally. both Orr and Bon-i.
temps played high school hall to-
gethor down in Toylorvrlle. 111.,
before Joming forces to play for
the Boloit Cold.

Dove Dllnlop's live gome aver-
age of 13A points has given him
third place in the conference scor-
ing race. Wayne “Buck" Weaver-
of Lawrence and “Doc" Weiske
of Ripon are running 172 above
Dai . with 16.3 and 15.3 averages
for the some number of con»
tests.
