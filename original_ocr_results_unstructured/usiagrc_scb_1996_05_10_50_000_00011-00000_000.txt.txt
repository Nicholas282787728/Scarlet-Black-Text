Consistency should tell the tale
for the Pioneers this weekend. With
only four players who typically figure
in the scoring, everyone in the quar»

However, the team has received a
boost from Senior Andtis Upitis and
Junior Clayton Kaneshrto who have
added depth to the team for the con—

Last Saturday a partial Pioneer

mark may give him a nod to compete
in the nationals. “Mark posted a

healthy and competitive team at
Carroll this weekend “We finished
third at the indoor meets, two points
behind Coe, If everyone does well,
we stand a good chance to make up
those points," said Coach Evelyn
