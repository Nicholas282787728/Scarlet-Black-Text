all the votes for each candidate.

At the end of the night, poll workers remove the paper rolls from
the machines. Those rolls have tabulations on them and those
numbers are written down, both 'on an ofﬁcial sheet and informally
by other poll workers to doublescheck. Everything is added up,
checked by others with calculators and recorded. Those records are
submitted with the cartridges to the auditor.

From this point on the night was

noticeable tension was prevalent while
anxious people on campus and around
the nation watched and listened to the
numbers closely.

wore on, saddened Democrats watched
as the Iowa numbers slip away from
them and all but seven states were dealt

Ohio. These States stayed a dull grey on
all TVs and maps until well past 1 a.m.,

the election hanging for the night.

Kerry conceded and thanked his voters
for all they had done and for the sup

past two years. ”In an American
election, there are no losers,” he
said. ”Because whether or not
our candidates are successful, the
next morning, we all wake up as
Americans. And that—that is the
greatest privilege and the most
remarkable good fortune that can
come to us on earth.

”With that gift also comes

Bush delivered his acceptance

phone call and wishing him and
his'family well. He then addressed
the excited crowd before him.
"America has spoken," he said,
”and I'm humbled by the trust
and the conﬁdence or my rellow
citizens. With that trust comes a

will do my best to fulﬁll that duty
