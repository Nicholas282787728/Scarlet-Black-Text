INTERESTING MEETING FOR MEN

About twenty men were present at
the class held Monday night in the li-
brary tor the purpose of learning the
principal things of interest about
Japan.

0. Routt gave an interesting talk on
the people, their habits and customs.
which proved very entertaining as
well as instructive. it wns proven
that a mission (:th5 can have a hearty
laugh now zmd then, and not be a dry
with, as is commonly supposed.

Harold Lamb gavea review or the
religions beside Christianity which
have such a strong hold on the Japs.
There are three cliici i-cligioiisesnln-
toism, Buddhism, and Conlucism.
An entire evening could well have
been given to the study or any one of
these. it was wonderiul to note what.
a hold these religions have upon the
millions of people inhabiting those
islands.

R. Clacktlien showed how Christi-
anity had been introduced and also
gave the history or Protestant Mis-
sions. There are at present nine hun—
dred missionaries, with a following or
hlty thousand.

Next Monday night, the social and
economic conditions will he discussed.
rl‘his ought to be a subject which

should be of great interest to every
man in school. It is not always that
such an opportunity for broadening
one's View of the World Will be Opnn to
one, and so every man should think
twice as to whether or not he can iii-
ford to miss it. We challenge you to
come and try an hour next Monday
night; from eight. to nine.

”In order to find out Whether El con
tain shipwrecked Dutchman was it
Christian or not, the Japanese asked
if he wasa Christian, and they were
exceedingly astonished when he Ire-
plied, “No, I’m a Dutchman.” Just
a few of these woven in with the talks
by the leaders help to eulh en the hour.

THE TEST OF THE COLLEGE
GRADUATE,

Good, roundabout commonsense has
never been superseded by the college
diploma. Alma Mater is no match
yet for Mother Wit, Nothing is more
common than to see our snicalled edur
dated men, that is, our academy-train-
ed and collegerbrerl men, surpassed in
mental and moral power and out»dis-
tunced in the race of life by rnen who
have known little if anything of our
set forms ol school training.

In taking all inventory of it man. it
is it matter 01' trivial moment to know
whether he was graduated from this
or that preparatory school: or any prer
paratory school, iroin this college. or
[hilt college. or any college. The
plain, blunt question which the world
asked yesterday and has been asking
today and Will 8le tomorrow is, What
of the man? How much is there of
him? and to him and in l‘lim‘.> What
can he dwido in the ﬁelds of labor7
do at the bedside of the patientiin
the pulpit Or at the bar?

This is the question of our times,
and it is El. fair, honest question. The
popular testi making havoc oi diplo-
mas and certiﬁcates. It says not, Tell
us the educational groove the young
man has been sliding in and which he
has slid through; its demand is not
Whether he hails from this school, 01'
that school, or no school; whether he
comes from at mansion or it cottage or
a. log hut. Put him on tho scales and
let us weigh him.

The question is not, Have you stud-
ied arithmetic, algebra, geometry, as-
tronomy, Latin, Greek, French, Ger-
man? but, ifyou have studied these
branches of knowledge, what have
they done for you?

The question is not, Have you grad-
uated from Harvard or Yale or Dari.-
moutll? but. If you have graduated
from one of these schools or learning,
what; has your college done for you?—
Estresident Ilurlhnt of Middlebul’y
College.
