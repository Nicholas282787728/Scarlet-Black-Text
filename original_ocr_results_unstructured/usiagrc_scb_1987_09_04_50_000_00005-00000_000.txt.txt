So this is .
Grinnell— — or a

marginal
facsimile

It has occurred to me, during
this initial week at school, that this
institution is really not Grinnell
College at all, but rather a
marginal facsimile thereot. 1
realize that over the course ol 3
fourteen-week summer one’s
perception oi school can tend to

Luc - Hatle'stad

become more and more idealized.
This is especially true when one's
vacation is tainted by daily ses»
sions oi semi-skilled labor and by
the recurring, yet startling revela-
tion that one must live by the rules
laid out by mom and dad while one
resides in their home. i think that
when you begin to take a statement
like. “Do the dishes beiore 1 get
home" and associate it with, “Cut
your throat beiore 1 get home," it's
probably time to think about grow»
ing up and moving out,

But 1've always had a pretty
good memory, and this is not the
college that i reluctantly leit in
May. Let's start at the PEG. Not
only is women’s seeder a varsity
sport, but they're actually making
cuts. The men's basketball team is
holding workouts, albeit iniormal
ones, in August. Those oi you
shocked by that last statement
should iirst oi all be commended
lor being true Grinnellians and sea
cond at all be comiorted by the {act
that these workouts are neither il-
legal, corrupt nor immoral. The
smattering oi new iaces at the
PEC are those oi new coaches, all
or whom have previous ex-
perience.

Cosmetically, the school has
taken on a laundered appearance,
one beiitting an institution ap»
patently unsatlsiied with being
number nine, There are now scads
oi little gray “tombstones,” which
seem to have sprung irorn the soil,

thereof

multiplying like rabbits, to mark
the location of every “significant"
building. Tnere are directional cola
umns on every corner, pointing the
way to places on a campus which
can be traversed on loot, diagonal-
ly, in about 11-10 minutes, We have
the tinished math/psychology ad
dition looming over the iorum,
South Campus has new windows
and a copper-lined loggia, and twin
volleyball courts where an
ultimate field once stood. lhaven’t
been to North Campus yet so I'm
not sure what has happened up
there.

But maybe this is Grinnell after
all. The athletic overhaul has
already caused a small stir, mostly
among non-athletes. People are
uncomfortable with this attempt to
establish some competitiveness in
the Pioneer sports programs. The
remodeled bookstore is apparently
being [untied by the outrageous
rise in the cost of books and laun-
dry chips. And oi course, it
Wouldn’t be Grinnell without a lit
tle early-autumn controversy. Oi
all the places deemed
“significant" enough to be bestowa
ed with a tombstone. the Black
Cultural Center was not one of
them. It couldn’t have been Norris
or the Physical Plant that was
iorgotien. in an “unlortunate coin-
cidence," the kind that Grinnell
College seems to have mastered,
the BCC was neglected. I think that
minority groups such as Blacks
and Gays are probably pretty led
up with unfortunate coincidences.

Finally, perhaps the thing that
threw me the most was this Canar
dian stretch ol weather. I IEed to

‘ look forward to a New Student

Days filled with three showers a
day and long hours spent beiore a
(an. But as i look around and see
hordes oi new iaces, proud or hav-
ing shattered the hallowed average
SAT standard, yet still uncertain of
whether ARH 102 is on the first or
second iloor, 1 realize that I have
truly come home.

Mrs. Sorley, our nextadoor
neighbor. once used her dead hus-
band as a doorstop. She had him
cremated years ago, after he died
of a heart attack, and used to keep
his ashes in a gray urn by the front
door. Once I accidentally kicked it

over when she asked me to step in-
side.

1 ielt terrible, and apologized
over and over and over.

She just waved it oii. “Naw,
don’t worry yourseli into a tizzy."
Then she swept up her spilled hus-
band with one ot those Black and
Decker hand vacuums.

1 went to Mrs. siirley's iuneral
last Tuesday. She named me as
one oi her pallbearers in her will or
something, so 1kinda ielt obligated
to go, Man, was she heavy. The
casket must've weighed two tons.

I remember as a kid when 1
would see her working early sums
mer mornings out in the garden,

the big sweat rings spreading slow-
ly under her arms as the day
warmed. She squatted on her
knees in the spaded soil, the huge
polyester dress hiked way up so
that the cellulite in her calves and
the intricate network oi blue veins
spreading just beneath the skin
became visible. it was really
repulsive.

1 was probably 11 or 12 when 1
started mowing ior her and other
neighbors on weekends. Early one
Saturday afternoon, I was Cutting
the grass around the lilac bushes
bordering the wood ience, way
back in the rear other yard, when

\she lumbered out on the back

doorstep and hollered over the roar
oi the engine, “Jimmy! When
you're done you come on in and
have lunch, h'ear'.’ i”

when the lawn mower sputtered
and died oiil could see her through
the screen door, a round iigure
waddle-shuirling to let me in. She
held the screen open. The fat hung
loosely oil her upper arm. As 1
passed through the doorway, she
clapped me on the shoulder, digg»
ing in with her fingers.

”We’ve got to put some meat on

youl " The hot weather became the
topic of her busy chatter as plate

lwas stu-uiied. ”Um . . . no more,
thanks,” I said through the last
mouthful. Then she Set down a
generous slice oi homemade
chocolate cake.

“Now then. 1 betcha got two,
maybe three girliriends,
don’tchal” Wink

1 dug my iork in. The cake
melted on my tongue.

Years later. when she heard that
I was accepted at Grinnell, she
called me over to her house a few
weeks betore l was to graduate
irom high school. 1 towered over
her, She gave me an awkward,
oversized hug and pressed 20
dollars intu my hand. “Spend it on
something fun." she said. The
smell oi stale rosemilk clung to me
as X left.

it was an open casket. Mrs,
Sorley looked alive, but waxy and
plastic. Her eyes were closed, but I
expected them to ily open and roll
over at me, the glint oi mischiei
still dancing in them. '

I’ll miss her. She was a nice
woman.
