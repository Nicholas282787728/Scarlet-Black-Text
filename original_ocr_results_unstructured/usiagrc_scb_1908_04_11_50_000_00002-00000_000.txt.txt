One ot' the much talhed at things in
regard to the Glee Club eoneert last
night was the nhathr on the put at
the audienee to the really excellent
work done by the elnh, and their utter
lack of enthusia n.

This is uniinlior int. in a war, ninl
deseries no particular mention,

The spirit shonn at the concert last
night wns the some spirit which hurt
our toothall team this tnll, which has
made the lecture coin-so linaneially .i

year on the nhole. a dead one.

We Ina} otter as excuses ior this
