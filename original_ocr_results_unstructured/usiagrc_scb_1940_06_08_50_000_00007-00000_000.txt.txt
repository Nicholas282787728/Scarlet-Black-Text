adding swimming, handball and
tennis to their list of victories.

sweep of the kittenball tourney
this year. They slugged their
way to a total of 102 points for
ten games with Bob Spangard

-—By Jack Wile —

Things seem to be looking up in
all of our varsity sports for next
year, and we can start right in
by looking up the football team
for next fall,

0 o 0
Nine men will be lost from this
year's squad in the next few
days, when graduation takes its
toll. Most of them are regulars,
too. However, Ben Douglas
should have a pretty optimistic
feeling when he looks over the
returning lettcrmen on his list.
I o o
Everyone’s been saying it and
we’ll say it againiBen and his
assistant have been doing things
this spring with the boys. The
spring practice wound up with

 

“razzle-dazzie" and we can ex-
pect big things after the first
kickoff next fall.

Basketball looks even better, if

we consider returning forces. The
Pioneers are losing only one man
from this year's squad. Captain
James Nash. Jerry Fort and
Gene Peisner are all set to take
over the captioning job and three
other letteimen will be back for
action. Add six more ot this

year's varsity and thirteen flashy
preps and you have a powei-
house. A bad finish dropped this
year's team out of the running
for the Midwest championship,
but with more reserve power
next year's story should have a
better flavor.
I o o

The tennis and golf teams are

going to need some polishing for

their return performances Cap-
tain Jack Savage, George cation
and James Beiscnstcin are leav-
ing the tennis squad Savage. by
the way, really turned on the
heat in his single matches. Five
preps are coming up tor varsity
action next year to help Carl
George, Clisi-lcs Sayre and the
newly-elected oaptai , Peisner.

Captain Robert Neiman, Harry
Jcnseii and Don Rullffson are
checking out or the golf lineup.
Bob Child is the only man left
out of tho first four, which
means that the imkmen won't
exactly have power to burn.
