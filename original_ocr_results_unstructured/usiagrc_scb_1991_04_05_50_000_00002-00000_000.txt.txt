noted expert on African»American
drama and culture. is visiting cam-
pus for the whole semester as a part
ofthe Black Scholars in Residence
program,which is sponsored by the
Office of MultivCultui-al Affairs.

vide more black adult role models"

met Dr. Robinson while on a book
tour at lheUniversity of California.
and encouraged her to consider a

visit to Grinnell. Robinson “liked
her energy" and when she deemed
that she “wanted to get out of Los
Angeles,"shevisited Grinnell. She
decided after her visit to become
involved with the Black Scholars in
Residenceprogram, because as she
said: "I loved it."

Robinson said that Grinnell has
an strong sense of community and
the “flavor of a very honest
America." which is missin g in much
of the country today, “1 like the
energy and whatl call the genius of
the students.“ she said. She praised
the intimacy, thirst for knowledge,
and dialogue between students and
faculty at Grinnell.

In keeping With the goals of the
program, Robinson feels that she
”has to be a role model." She feels
that her presence on campus has
been effecuve because everyone
has been “very, very receptive and
supponive" despite the fact that

SGA ﬁscal policy pleases some, concerns other

By Daniel Bliss

Last month one of the biggest
increases in recent years in the
comprehensive fee was approved
by the trustees. The rise of 9% led
to complaining butlittle action from
the student body. But another po-
tentially touchy issue lies within
that comprehensive fee. Grinnell
College’s student government
budget, which grows with the tu»
ition, will total over $171,000 for
the 19904991 school year.

For SGA Treasurer Thom Main
and Assistant Treasurer Matt
Stippich, however, the steady
growth of student government
money is a welcome break. More
organizations earl get what they
want, though as Main readily con»
cedes the system is not without its
shonages. Heated discussion. ar-
gument and even the occasional

signs of a problem of allocation of
money that is at its worst with re

gard to the spons clubs.“Wedo have

not on a line item ," said Main, who
noted that three times as much
money as was available was re
quested by clubs this year. “It’s
something that needs to be fixed
that's being worked on.” In the
meaniimehowever, itis in the hands
of one of SGA’s copious commit-
tees, a “task force" involving the
heads of sports clubs.

Most campus organizations,
though. seem fairly happy with
their ﬁnancial support from SGA.
Political organimlons in particular
seem to be managing well, in spite
of the relatively small size of the
Political Activities Support Fund.
Gretchen Landwehr of tho Politi»
Cally Active Feminist Alliance
(PAFA) expressed satisfaction with
their budget. And other such orga-
nizations are often fairly indepenr
dent of student government finance.
a pointnoted by Scott Wittstruck of
Poverty Action Now.

The system is not immune to

change, indeed, student govemr
ment faces two major changes in
the way its ﬁnances are handled.
One change isalready almost com
plete. The computerization of SGA
nccountsthatwasbegunbyStippich
last fall is almost fully in place, and
it has involved a major centraliza-
tion of money handling. There is a
clear confidence on their pan that
the change has helped to create a
system that is watertight.

How watertight? Very watere
tighLaccordingto Main. “We never
run a deficit. Our budget structure
is such that it is basically impos-
sible," he said. He and SLippich
also claimed that the new system is
almost immune to abuse. because
every transaction has to be entered
and recorded on an aecountopen to
public inspection. But some, in-
cluding Clifford Sell. Business

cap on revenue that can be mised.

“If the S and B were allowed to
use the money it earns [for such
improvements] it would result in

said Sell. “If they want a better
paper, they have to do something
