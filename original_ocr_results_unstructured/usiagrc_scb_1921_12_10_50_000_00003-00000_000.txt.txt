Round About

BY GOLLY

- Not being able to keep out or the
argument in progress in the What Do
You Think coiulns any longer. we have
taken it upon nursell’ to seek the views
of prominent campustry experts. Here-
with is our symposiu .

Liz iiilchrist: I think the rec hours
should be done away with entirely,
It people want to dance. let them fuls
ﬁll their desires in aesthetic dancing

Miss Read: I believe that the num—
ber of rec hours we have at present
is entirely insuiticient. I am about
to recommend that we have a ret
hours every evening and iniornial
dancing in the afternoons. I am an
the (acuity will agree to dismiss all
classes.

Buddy Bosardus: I think it is tel--
ribie the number of rec hours we have.
It is a disgrace to the school. We
must have tewer. We are becoming
nothing but a crowd oi dnhce and tea
hounds. I suggest that for recreation
we be allowed to play drop the Hands
liershief and London bridge such
games give the destrsd exercise to
the pedal extremities, and what could
be more fun?

Virgle Besser: Terrible. I air.
Shocked to tears every time anyboli'
asks me what we do for entertainment
in Grinnell and I am forced to tell
them that we dance.

Mr, Spencer: Absolutely disgusted
My sense of propriety is entirely jars
red out of place. 1 think it is redlcus
ions that we can not have more dame»
lng| In fact, I think we must have
more. I shall take it up with the
proper committee at once.

Clay Harshbarger: Now. in the ﬁrst
place, we should have no more rec
hours because they ruin the morals
of the student body. Then, there is
plenty or recreation to be gained
through hikes up the hi. and st. L. or
out into the country. Therefore, I be.
lieve it is suiticientiy proved that the
rec hour is a useless ad harmiui in»
stitution and should be abnndoned‘ at
once.

Margaret McDonald: By all means.
let us have more rec hours. I do not
see any reason why we should not
have daily dances, and I alu'also in
favor of allowing the men’s hall and
the quad cottages to‘ give dances at
least once a week. I am sure that all
straight thinking people will agree
with me.

Katharine Fal‘nell and Josephine1
Sikhema entertained at dinner Friday.
Their guests were Harriett Wadsworth
Gould Lowery, Mrs. Dwight Garner.
Donaldine Grass, Susan Saar and Hei-
en Cline. Pink and white place cards
and camauons were used effecuvely
as table decorations.
