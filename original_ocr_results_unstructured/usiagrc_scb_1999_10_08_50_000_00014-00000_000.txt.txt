The Grinnell College women’s
tennis team has reached :1 crucial
point in rheir season.

The pioneers face Knox College
in a home match this Saturday at
11 1m., with the winner advanc-
ing to the Midwest Conference
tournament as the number two
team in the Southern Division, A
loss to Knox would mean that
Grinncll wouldn't have the oppor-
tunity to defend their 1998 ride.

“We have been building to this
match in the schedule," said Coach
David Arseneault. “The outcome of
the Knox match will essentially de-
termine our fate relative to the fi»
nal four."

The conference tournament this
year has been modified to consist
of an individual pool tournament
as well as a ream eomperirion, in
stead ofrhe traditional single tout-
nament. The “final four” are the top
two teams from both the northern
and southern divisions d'ml will face
offin the team competition at the
conference tournament.

“We have been concentrating
on elevating the games ofrhe girls
in die lower halfofour lineups" said
Arsenault. “Our ﬁve and six spots
will be critical in clinching a win.”

Maiko Morotam [’02], Amy
Kaufman [’00] and Christine
Caulton [’01] continue to soar. The
three Pioneers traveled to the Rolex
tournament last weekend, Camper»
ing in a tournament consisting of
the best players in the Midwest. All
three adwnced to die second round
of play with Morotani progressing
into the third round.

to run against some of the other
conference teams,

“1 expcct a number of confert
once schools to run at Monmouih
this weekend, so it should bea good
measure ofhow we compare," said
Coach Evelyn freeman. “it is the
last opportunirywe will have to run

as a complete unit before the league
meet in November."

Last Saturday the harriers had
to battle through the absence of
two ofrheirrop fourruimers Katie
converse ['01) and Katie Groark
['03] were both sidelined for the
inset. “itwas frustrating to have to
watch the nice from crutches," said
Converse, still nursing a nagging
stress fracture.

Despite the injuries, the rest of
the Pioneers battled on. Nicole
Cueno ’02 continued to impress,
ﬁnishing with another strong sub
20 minute race. Cueno plated

Football can be ridden with cli-
ches, and one of the oldesr1s that
defense wins ballgames, That axiom
deﬁnitely held true for Grinnell,
Saturday, in a 17-14 road victory
against Clarke.

Continuing a season long trend,
Grinncll played yet another nail
biter Saturday. In fact despite a 5.1
(370) record the Pioneers have yet
to have a blow out, every game has
been decided by eight points or less.
Thus to call the game a nail birer is
probably inaccurate, because most
ofthc coaches and fans probably do
not have any nails left to biteCoach
Creg Wallace knew what to expect
from a tough, physical Clarke team,
saying “we expectan extremelysnff
test" and despite a 0—2 record on
terin'g the game, he continued that
they possessed “a great defense,"

Clarke did play well defensively,
but not as well as their counterparts.
Crinnell amassed a most impressive

nine sacks on defense, Wallace com-
mented “the defense played an out:
standing football game, they kept
us in the game."

The offense struggled at points,

about the running game, however,

Wallace noted that illinois pos-

But hcwcnt on the say that “it's just
another challenge our defensive
coaches and players have to deal
with. We have to adapt defensively
to different offensive teams.”

Illinois combines a rushing ate

game with a powerful passing arse
