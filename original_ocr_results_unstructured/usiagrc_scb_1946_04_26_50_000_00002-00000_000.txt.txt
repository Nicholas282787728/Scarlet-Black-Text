At seven o’clock on the morning of
April 17, 1946, a Dibble man was overheard
to remark to a Cowles man that the Clark
men always looked happy. The Rawson man
who did the overbearing promptly told a
friend from Gates that the Dibble men had
said the Clark men were sappy. The Gates
man thought this over and, sensing the
development of an interesting situation, in-
formed his buddies that the Clark men were
planning a raid on Dibble because the Dibble
men had stated in no uncertain terms that
the Clark men were a bunch of no good,
stupid, halfewitted saps. Several Clark men
who got wind of the discussion were natural-
ly hurt. They conducted a poll in Clark.
This democratic procedure showed a vote
of 2640 (three men refused to vote) that
the'Dibble opinion was not true. Entliused
by this information, Clark men rallied and
called an indignant meeting to determine
what punishment might be most suitable for
Dibble. Tragedy was nairowly averted by
a counter rumor which arose the same eve-
ning to the effect that the Smith girls were
planning to lengthen the cloister tunnel. This
diverted the attention of the angry Clarks-
men.

For some time now there has been an
attitude prevalent on campus that we as
students of Gi‘innell are not being shown
proper deference due our age and ability.
We seem to feel that since the college is try-
ing to help us become responsible adults, we
ought to be given adult authority and re-
sponsibility and subjected to less st ict
rules and regulations. We imply that it is
an insult to our integrity to be forced to
obey rules which would not be imposed up—
on us at home. We may be right:

The above-related fictious incident, how—
ever, offers in part an illustration of why
we are treated as we are. We have shown
in many and varied ways that we have
childish attitudes and are subject to gulli-
bility not worthy of adults. We do not act
as adults even when it comes to observing
rules of common courtesy. We push and
shove in the quadrangle dining room line.

Dear Senator Wilson:
A COLUMN 0F

We, the undersigned students at
Grinnell college, all veterans of World
War II, wish to let it be known that we ym BEAUTY
are opposed to any change in the pres-
ent effective method of price control.

Because of the large amount of
money in circulation and the shortages
of goods created during four years of
war, we are firmly convinced that any
relaxation of price controls at this time
will lead to a disastrous inflation.

A similar letter was also sent to Senator C.
Wayland Brooks, of Illinois

There are many good reasons for this
stand toward inflation. One of these men
saw the results of inflation while overseas. “OHS Engagement to receive the
