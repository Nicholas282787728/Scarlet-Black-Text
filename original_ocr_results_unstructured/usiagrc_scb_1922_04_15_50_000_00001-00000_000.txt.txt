the two mile is temporarily on the inn

leaving another chance for the sopho-
mores to score a few needed points,
But in spite of the loss or these men
the freshmen should be able to carry

Critchet, who scored heavily in the

strong point getter for the sophs. This
will be his ﬁrst competition this year
