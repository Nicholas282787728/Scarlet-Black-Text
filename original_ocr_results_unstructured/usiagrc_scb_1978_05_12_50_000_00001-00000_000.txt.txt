The sun cabinet is sending a
letter to Deans Walker and
Tedei'iiian expressing their obs
jections to the proposed job
description ior Georgia Dentel.

The letter. drafted by SGA
President Jon Nciderbach, Con-
tains objections to the luck or
administratiun solicitation of
student input about changes in
Daniel’s Job description and
iocuses on some oi the speciiic
changes,

IF DENTEL signs her proposed

1978779 contract. she wtll receive a
raise and longer working hours.
But points of contention regarding
the job description still exist, and
her negotiations \iith Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Tederman and
Dean Waldo Walker are still going
on.
The proposed contract is a lull
time tenrmonth contract with no
paid vacation Under her current
Contract. she works threerfourth
time for nine months.

NEIUERBACH admits this iS an
improvement. but he points out
that Dentel actually works eleven

work during the summer to put out
the tall calendar,

job description. which are open to
interpretation, rather than the

cent approved of boycotting
products marketed by the Swiss
corporation accused oi using
questionable techniques in the
promotion oi baby iormula in the
Third World.

Tl) be put into eilect, the boycott
proposal needed at least 20 per cent
of all students on board voting in
favor of it.

According to Klno Ruth, SGA
election board chairman, the
boycott will only be in effect for the
remainder oi the school year, and
the proposal will have to be voted
on again in the tall. Wednesday's
referendum, Ruth says. “was to
show Dave McConnell that
students are against having Nestle

products on campus. so that he can
plan accordingly this summer"

MCCONNELL. head of Food
Service, says he will have no
problem going along with the
boycott, The only Nestle product
used by Food Service is instant tea.

different brand. “We probably do
$25 worth of business lrom Nestle
per month." according to Me
Connell.

in the case oi Nestle products
marketed in the bookstore, Me-
Connell says that the candies it ill
remain. and students will boycott
or buy on their own opinion,

The proposed amendments to the
SGA constitution passed with 73,4
per cent oi 297 votes cast tavoring
them. The amendments make
several minor changes in SGA
procedures, and also set up a
manner in which the SGA eons
