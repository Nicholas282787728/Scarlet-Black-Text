Help translating professor-speak

since my mother is a college professor, I grew up
observing teachers in their natural environments. 1 know
well their sleeping habia. their grooming habits, and what
theyd do for fun ifthey ever had the time. More impure
rantiy, after years and years of exposure, 1 can now par-
tially understand the large canyon ofdiiterencc between
what profs say and what they mean, Although some
phrases, such as “I’d like to see you after class” ean mean
drastically different things depending on tone and
amount ofwinking and eyebrow movement involved,
other codes can be broken rather easily Here are some
staple teacher—to.reality translations that should be know
by every Student:

- “The test will cover die iargerconeepts ofthe course"
: “read the oneparagi—aph chapter summaries and be
smarter than the Nosepicker and you’ll be ﬁne,"

- “Sarah, do you have anything to addz" : "You’re
thinking about that chocolate SnaekPack you bought at
Southern hot night instead ofthe relationship between
religion and ritual in late Tokugama society, aren't you?

- “The ﬁnal exam might be challenging.” = "since
you have already turned in your course evaluation, and
since the class average is high. I have come for your god.
fearing souls. There is no hope, none at all."

- “To do well in this class you must put in extra ee
fort outside ofthe classroom." : ”I am eompletely oblivie
ous to the fact that you are involved in three other classes
and a handful school activities. 1 do not understand why
Cellular Biology and i are not the center ofyour uni,
verse.

. "You should be finished in an hour." : “the smart
kid who tucks his pants into his socks will be done in an
hour. The rest ofyou should bring one days ration of
food and water as well as emergency ﬂares.“

- "Ifyou've done the readings, you‘ll be fine " e “if
you've done the readings, you’ll be fine, but l know that
you iiaven'tl"

. “Tl-re exam will consist ofa series ofcssays." = “This
test will be based on endurance. not rich. check your
health plan for carpal tunnel syndrome coverage "

- "Have a nice dayl"=“H2vc a nice day-rifyou darel
Muhhahahahal“

Bringing art to Grinnell

Karla Niehus and Conni Gause expand the community’s fine art sensibilities

by Dave Chenault
Staff Writer

in the course ofrescarching the goings-Oil in the seemingly small
art world oforinneli, low, 1 discovered that two women are trying
to expand the community's horizons. As oftoday few people in the
community hav: heard oflhcir efforts, but that will soon change.

Karla Nichus is the curator ofeducntion :it the Fuulconer Gallery
It is her yob to promote public awareness ofcvents put on by and/or at
the Gallery. in herwords, she is in charge ofi‘yustabout anything that
helps the public access the art." Such things as openings. lectures,
and master classes done with visiting artists are the things her rob has
normally entailed, However, she intends to change that a bit.

Nlehus holds a masters in Art History from the UniversiryofChi-
cago, She is a short, athletic woman who answers questions with
articulate acclaiity and talks excitedly about the prospects she sees for
Grinnell College and the Grinnell community-at-lnrge The roourees

rcsentsis. in heropinion,sometliingthatcotild

She talks of getting “Grinueli recognized
throughout Iowa as an arts destination," and
sees town and gown cooperation as way to
achieve that. She expresses sadness [lmt art
events like this pest weekends sidewalk palnlr
mg workshops, or this weekend's sandy
Skoglund art “insmllntlon” are lost in the Carn-
pusMemo. resultingin manystudents ncvet hearing ofthcm. Events
such as the spam and tofu urvlng evening this past Wednesday, and
the aforementioned street painting workshop, are her most recent
efforts to mobilize college support for the arts, support which could
be transformed into community involvement. in fact, the street paint-
ing workshop represents the first collaboration between the Faulconer
Gallery and Grinncll Productions, another entity most students have
heard ofbrtt few really know about,

“it is central to the community." it is a bright Monday morning
and I am sitting in the downtown office of Gtinnell Productions,
listening to Conni Gause expound on the virtues ofShakespeat: in
the Parks venue. There were in excess 0800 people in attendance
this past weekend, and she expects more Word ofmoutli does it, she
says; people tell their friends and come back themselves. “We always
have repeatsw she says. and smiles, Gause is another force in the move
to create town/gown community through the medium of art. An
lowa native, she grew up in the town ofLinville before moving to the
Marshalltown area and getting a position at Grinncll College, She
worked for the college for 15 years. always in an administrative posi—
tion, 1995-2001 in the Fine Arts office. \‘(lhen in Inn. 2000 Grilinell

—Karla Niehus

Productions offered her a job running the edminrstrarrvc aspects of
the nonprofit, it seemed like a petfcct fit. The position expanded to
ruil.timc within months. and she has been at it ever since.

Grinneli Productions itself was founded in 1994, its founding
members include present theatre department faculty Pip Gordon and
Eric sanning. Their intention was to combine professional and com-
munity resourcs to put on musicals in the community in recent
years, their focus has expanded considerably, Shakespeare in the Park
began last fall, and was so successful that a repeat performance oftlie

College professors reading their own poetry to a seventy year old a

again this October, on the first Friday ofevery month.

Most exciting on the new agenda, however.
is the fall Art Cooperative it offers a variety of
courses in two six-week sessions, some taught
by Griiincll College students. There are classes
for all ages. and for a modest fee anyone om

Productions will also undertake a partnership
with the local New Horizons Alternative High

it provides “good challenges for me" which “makes it fun." Sh: loves

dents," she says; “without college interns, i couldn't do what 1 do."
And what cause does is important, with the housing and board
policies ofthe colleges administration keeping college students from
contributing to the local eeonomyand interacting with the town popu—
lation, it is people like conni causcand Karla Nichus that bridge the
gap between the two, hopefully fostering a relationship that will en.
rich both sides.
