One Won, One Lost.

The bil' 'et ball season for Glln'
nell this year closed with the two
games played at Des Moines last
Friday and Saturday. The game
Fiidny. or which mention has al-
ieatiy been made in these col-
umns, was played with the D_cs
Moines Y, M, C. A. It started in
with listless work on the part of
Grinnell and fast team work on
the part of Des Moines Fora
while the score was a ., then it
became 472 favor of Des
Monies; then 4.4. on, 7.4 and at
tlle close of the halt, the score was
1374 in favor of Des Moines. With
the beginning ottheseeondhalt
Grinneli began to oiltrplay Des
Moines atevery point. The score
rapidly became more even, Des
Memes being abieto score but
twice during the halt, while Grins
neil piled up pointatter point un.
til she had [4 to Des Moines l7.
It seemed but a question ot a ten
mOle minutes before Grinneil
would be in thelead, but thcse
few minutes were denied and the
whistle blew witll this score.

The game played Saturday with
Des Moines College ivas played
with much better torin on the part
of Grinnell than that of Friday
night. The game was entered in-
to with spirit tram the beginning.

The score started in favor of
Grinnell,and never did DesMoines
trike the lead, although at one
time the score was 5-5. From this
time on, however, Grinnell led
with from two to ﬁve points until
the end oi the game which ended
rpm in tavorot Grinneii. The
game was fast and quite close
from beginning to end, The line-
up was as toiloivs;

Cataloging Apparatus.

Some time ago the protessors
iii the departments of biology and
physics conceived the idea of cate
aioguing the apparatus in their
respectivelaboratories, There are
many advantages which come
iroin such a catalogue. Every are
tieie could be assigned a place and
them could be a much more care
iul arrangement of instruments
and apparatus. It could be seen
at a glance what instruments were
or were not in the laboratories,
how many instruments of every
sort and what the value and capa-
city of each was. The walk has
been begun, and a thorough liste
ing of all apparatus is taking place.
With the name of each instrument
will be the place, date and cost of
purchase, capacity, approximate
value, place in the laboratory, etc.
Besides this, every instrument and
piece ot apparatus willbe marked.
50 that it it is misplaced or there
is need otrcterenee, the page and
division ot the catalogue may be
easily found by referring to this
mark.

The committee from the Uni-
versity at Wisconsin reports the
Chicago drainage canal as an ideal
place to hold the boat races and
they are trying to arrange a meet-
ing between Cornell, Yale, Har-
vard. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
to take place on the course.—
