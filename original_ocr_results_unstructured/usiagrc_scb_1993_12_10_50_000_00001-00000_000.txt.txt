time on Monday

By Alan Ostergren

OLLEGE officialsreport that

ahatecrime occuned against

a female student at approxi-

lately 1:30 am. Monday. Accord-

lg to Siclinda Canty-Elliot. Assis-

u'tt Dean of Multicultural Affairs,
to student was verbally abused.

“A young lady went to study in

ne of the residence hall lounges.
he asked the two males there if it
as all right to study there and they
. ed cursing at her and making
cial slurs,“ Canty-Elliot said. She
ISO said that the men were white and
e victim was “a person of colori"

Canty-Elliot said that the inci-
ent was reported to Student Affairs
y a friend of the victim.and Student
, fairs then reponed it to the Grin-
llPolice Department. She said that

e Victim did not know the men by
arne and Student affairs is still in-
estigating the matter.

Patrolman Tim Eich of the Grin~
nell Police Department said, ”l'he
victim hasn’tdecided whether or not
she wants to ﬁle a fortnal complaint.
Having not talked to the victim. it is
really hard to say which section [of
the Iowacriminal code] would apply.
It is possible that an assault hap-
pened." According to Eich, for an
assault to occur physical contact be-
tween the perpetrator and the victim
is not necessary, only that the act is
intended to put an individual in fear
of harm. Eich said that the assault
law contains a provision for consid-
ering the race of the victim and it is
possible that a charge could be ﬁled
as a serious, rather than simple, mis-
demeanor. A serious misdemeanor
carries apenalty ofupto a$1000ﬁne
and up to one year in prison.

College ofﬁcials have placed a
message on the opening vax screen
asking for information related to the
incident.
