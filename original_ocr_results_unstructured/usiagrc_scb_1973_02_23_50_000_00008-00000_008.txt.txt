Night in this northern clime brlngs only night.
What's there to do? I Wait, write ragged verse,.
Read verse that bites. But mostly I rehearse

A wild heauty, naked while and closed tight

On a struggling heast (so iierce in its might,

Yet gentle in soul). No garden surrounds

Them; biting verse seems tame. On a cave’s ground
They lie in wait; a play to spring in night.

Yet plays mean more than action, scenes repeat
Past deed and epilogue; the bard's truth is

But a halt truth. For when we take our parts

No rehearsal's needed. We know by heart

And never play. So know dear, my kisses

Rehearsed are by heart (more than lust) replete.

Smooth, and

Long, and

Hum, and...

Bus goes swtsnm
and lerk,

and hump.

Bus goes RUMBLE",
and heave

and I awaken,
haltedreamed

and groggy-eyed

and tumble—ready

l awake...

and I feel

the mumble of voices
and rhythm oi carry
as the bus

goes SWISH,

I Ieel...way high.

New I'm that bird
Soaring in blue sky-—
Way high, way iree,
Part of the air

is part oi me.

So happy, so free--

I feel...

Way above the sky,
and

Way above the tree-n
i am the high,

and the high is me.

Running away

Crying suitly, oh so...
Warm to touch.

A septuagenarlan and a child
He was my lather,
having a long white heard,
and a very wrinkled lace,
and he would constantly smoke cigars.
Sometimes it became quite stuiiy.
We didn't speak much to each other,
lnstead we consulted silently over
a tamily bihle.
Sometimes I would see him move his lips
silently,
while he glanced down at the blurred pages,
barely Visible within the candle glow.
I learned from his mute lips and
I would read grand messages into their movement.
Until one day
And thats how the story ends.
R. Quint

What happened to walks in the evening,
when all that came out OI my mouth

sounded too much like philosophy
And even the trains and ﬁreflies cooperated?
What happened to morning marches in the rain?
And what happened to times when Silence sufficed
When words were deﬁcient?
why have the sounds grown so

important that hesitation creates
A frustrating moment OI awkward silence

Hal Cooper

Apparitions

Light hovers over my chair
While the Smell of soup
Drills through the room.

Upstairs,
The ghosts or our bodies
still he in the wrinkled whiteness,

there is nothing I can do

the sound of a dream has disturbed me
I get up, out or bed

and there is nothing

I can do to persuade it

to return to sleep

it will not allow

{or even the softness of a bed

and who will hold my hani‘ls'.7

and put the quieting sands into my eyes
now that my father is gone

with his own nights

without his daughters’

these dreams are not the really had ones
trightened hy darkness

they are only the ones

that oblige me

to write tor their restless simplicity
such as the cold ﬂoors

touched by the night's foot

and quiet, except for the continual
trucks on the road

which must be always moving

not in the way you move me

or I am moved

out in a way understood only by
the men who are awake all night
and do not know that I am

thinking at them
the drunks, truck dlrvers, and policemen
sometimes tathers
and perhaps even their daughters
all of us without comtort.
what shall we look tor then?
