Reporter Almost Succeeds in Getting
Interview With Helen Hayes Monday

Interviewer Sees Actress
in Role of Queen
of Scots

By Edward Fillyatrick

I was told to get an interview with

Helen Hayes in Des Moines Monday
night where she was playing in "Mary,
Queen oi Scots," with her traveling
.stock company. Bravely setting out,
via the "thumb route," I reached Des
Moines a little alter 5 o‘clock. and
set out to iind Miss Hayes.

A phone Call to her suite at the
Kirkwood hovel revealed that she was
out to dinner. Next, I enquired at the
Shrine Temple, where she was sched.
uled to periorm. Again no luck. She
had not come in as yet.

Hayes Appears

Deciding that there was nothing else
to do but wait, I stationed myself at
the stage door and waited. Just hali
an hour beiore curtain time, she
arrived. She walked along with bent
head, a tiny iigurc in blue, wearing a
small, round hat. looking up, she
smiled a “thank you” for the door
I held open. -

‘I forgot my careiully worded re.
quest ior an interview—I had spent
nearly two hours phrasing it. I (or.
got the letter oi introduction in my
pocket—written by myseli, which I
had hoped would get me back stage.
I forgot everything when I saw her.

Seems ﬁred

Why Helen Hayes was hardly as
tall as my shoulder, and {rail looking?
She seemed older than I had expected.
A little tired, perhaps, from the strain
of playing so many ”one—night smnds."
but her smile was nice, and her eyes
sparkled with laughter. At me, I
wondered? .

‘ Aiter she had passed 1 suddenly re.
membered my hastily written note and
gave it to the doorman who sent it,
via a call boy, to Miss Hayes’ secre.
tary. ,

The secretary asked, “Would I
come back after the final curtain?"
Wouldn't I though, i thought as l

turned to go.

Largo Crowd

Feeling quite gay 1 .climbed to my
seat in the 22 row oi the balcony,
and waited tor the curtain. A teach.
er irom Roosevelt High school re.
marked, she had struggled through the
worst crowd in Des Moines since
“Teddy” Roosevelt was here." A re.
mark which illustrated the actresses
tame. and drawing power.

es, but they were not needed to see
or sense the beauty and majesty oi
Mary oi Scotland. Helen Hayes was
every inch the queen who loved rash.
ly, gambled and lost nobly, and died
bravely. Her audience broke into ap.
plause many times during the play.
and at last seemed unwilling to he.
lieve that the periormancc was over.

No interview

Hurriedlyl pushed my way back.
stage where a crowd waited for Miss
Hayes. In the crowd I tell left out
until her secretary asked if i had
sent a note.

Miss Hayes had sent word she
couldn't spare the time, but that her
secretary could answer any questions,
the woman, who had been introduced
as Miss Hayes' secretary, explained.

As I turned to go, disappointed, the
secretary, added, “Oh. yes. Miss Hayes
thanks you ior your little note." And
thus ended my attempt or hali.inter.
view with Helen Hayes.
