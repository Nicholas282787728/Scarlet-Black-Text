REGISTRATION AHEAD!

Now that registration days for next
year have been set for the following
week, students should look ahead and
get their courses outlined so that Tegv
istration will not be a lztst minute

rush and a hopeless selection of sub-
jects which have no hearing on the
general course of the individual. More!
and more, educators are getting away
from tlle ﬁxed concentration on indi-‘
vidual subjects and requiring a tier}
groc of perfection in the course as a‘
whole. More and more, each indiv‘
dual student is called upoli to exercise
his judgment and will in selecting the}
courses which will round out his cdlr
cation find not merely get him by. A
worth while course is the product of
careful thought. Look ahead.

NOT A RECESSIONAL

For the past few weeks, considel'r
able space in the editorial columns
of this paper has been devoted to a
discussion of the reasons why Grin-
nell should not have secret fraternal
organizations, Briefly these are ﬁrst.
secret fraternities interfere with col-.
legc activities, particularly athletic -
second, secret fraternities bring rid
cule on the college; third, secret fi‘ar
tcrnities are not constructive but de-
structive in their influence because
they foster group and not college my
city, they are opposed to a democratic
spirit, and they destroy the unity of
the strident body.

Each of these phases has been dis
cussed and numerous facts regarding
the truth of each charge have been
set forth. There has been no l'efutzl»
tion by the people so criticised, the
any reply being an admittance of the
existence of secret rrntcrnal groups
and an attack on the editor of the pa—
per for discussing the matter publicly.
Hand in hand with the editorial dis—
cussion has gone a campaign in the
news column of the paper, presenting
the experience with sect-ct fraternities
of various schools comparable to
Grinnell. There has also been an in—
dependent student campaign against
these organizations. the SCARLET
AND BLACK being the medium for ex-
pression,

when the campaign against secret
fraternal organizations in Grinocll
was started, the SCARLET AND
BLACK carried the following stiller
ment: “the growth and development
of the college is dependent on the uni-
dcd action of the student body. The
admin ion of fraternities and sorori-
ties would mean the brcalring up of
the democratic spirit fin" which Grin-
nell is famous. For that reason, the

gem tions in the dormitorios and the

quadrangle has storm of

Eventually. this plan would be effec-

the activities of a local group of “Loyr

filiated with the college but who are
most active in the “temporarily de-

ceased" fraternity. It is these town

nlcn, former students, business men
and friends of former students, who
have been the nucleus around which
the entire trouble has centered. These

FINLAND SUBJEGI [1F
LEBIUEL—lﬁl WEEK

Big Question Is Whether Finland
Is to Be White or Red, Ac»
cording to Speaker.

Taking up tho new states 01 cells
tinl Europe which are along the post

lRllssiu, l’l'ol Robert Il. Lord spoke
:ou "Finland" in thc liar-lard ex—

change lecture in Herrick Cllilpcl a
week flgu Tliuisdar According to the
spcnkcr, Finland has an area or 120,-
000 so miles, a population of three
rand one half million and is the sol enth
,largest state of Europe in area, The
country has a relatively mild climate
and a rocky soil which permits cul—
tivation of only eight per cent of the
land, in race and language the people
of Finland belong to Asia rather than
to Europe. Professor Lord character-
ized the people as being second collie
ins of the Hungarians and forty sec,
ood cousins of the Turks, and lion-
gols.

Conquered by Swollen

Following this introduction to the
now statc cl Finland the lecturer pro-
cccdcd to give a brief historical ic—
sume of the country. Finland was
conquered by Sweden in the 12th cen-
tury and remained a part of that
country until 1309 when it was l'ul'cir
blr taken from her by Russ . Di
ing this period the chdcs hocamo cs-
tahlislrcd as the aristocracy and the
bourgeois classes of the country while
the Finns were reduced to stotc 5011*
dom. Alexander I, the Russ Tsnr
naulc the Country a grand duchy of the
empire so that its union with Russill
\vzls personal rather than real. The
Films then enjoyed immunity from
war and progressed intellectually and
economically. The nationality of the
Finns was revived at thltt time and
kept alive by a small orginzatlon
which set about to bridge the gulf
between the masses and the al'istoce
racy. Great progress was made and
the national language was developed
and made official.

According to Professor Lord, Flue
land has progiessed economically al-
though not rich in natural resources.
Timber, water, power for manufactur-
mg and dai iiig have been the main
sources of her prosperity.

“White or Retl" is I’Iollltlm

‘Tha great problem before the new
state is whether Finland is to be
“White" or “Red," the lecturer de-
clared. She has also had an agrarian
problem to meet. During the polltir
cal struggle between the Films and
the Russians in the late 19th and Zﬂth
centuries, the Finns w o utlresymapti
centuries. the Finns won the sympa-

rthy‘ 0! the outside World and became

.cnnvinced that the preservation of
their nationality lay in independence
from Russia. Their opportunity came
in the spring revolution in 1917. The
Kel'ensky government adopted a lib-
eral attitude toward Finland as did
the later Bolshevikl but with this di -
tinction. that the latter poured into
the country, followers of their own
cult to scc that the government was
Eolshev-lki in character. A bloody
ci ‘l we folloped between the
"White, ' and the "Reds" in which the
latter held the advantage until the
Germans interfered and restored the
conservatives to power. The proscr-
rnan element in the country proposed
the establishment of a monarchy with
a German piincc as rulcr but the col-

Ilapse of Germany in 1913 led to the

organization of a rcpuhli Tho ex
cutivc of the new state a. president
elected by popular vote while the leg
department is unicnmeral.
Agrarian reforms have been put
through in the last few yea - and the
new state has been recognized by most
governments

In concluding Frotcssor Dm’d stated
that the indepondcncc of Finland is
pretty well assured with little chance
of encroachment from Russia at
least for some time to come. with
nropcr government it should become
a peaceful. scdatc, rcspcctcd, and use-
ful nation like Denmark or chdclr,
