Hide from the cold and get
lost in Midsummer magic

nv MATT ZMUDKA

Expect to suspend your disbelief a bit and
enter a more magical world at the Flanagan
Studio Theater this weekend.

The Gtinuell Theatre and Dance Departs
ment’s production ofShakespeare’sAMidlzlm-
Irier' Align/3' Dream began Wednesday with an
open rehearsal and continues through Sunday.

sandy Mottett, professor emeritus ofThe»
atre, will be directing the play; he also directed
a production of Mranmimrr- tor the Roberts
stage in 1975. “I love the play. It’s a play that
you can bring almost anything to,"he said.

According to Moffett, Midsummer is a
lighter play than what has
been performed in past years,

Luke Saunders ’11, playing the role of
Egeus, for one, was very enthusiastic about the
flilries’ performance. “It adds another level of
willful suspension ofhellef," he said,“It makes
it weirder . ,. in a good way.”

The adaptability inherent in Midsummer
makes it welltsuited for Flanagan. The large,
multielayer set structure, extends far into the
ﬂy space and is surrounded on all sides by
chairs. The result is less available seating for
audience members (the show was sold out by
Tuesday), but it allows for creative directing
that creates a whimsical intimate experience
for theatiergoers. “We’re really directing this
in vertical and horizontal
dimensions,” Moffett said.

noting that it is funny while
retaining substance. It has alt
ways been regarded as one of
Shakespeare's funniest plays,
and has proven to also be out:
of his most adaptable.
Directors have used the
magical world of Midsummer
to ﬂex their creative muscles

notjust with people on the

place, actors all over."

The effect of the mm,

and, according to Moffett,
portray a varying set ofmoods,
with this production falling
somewhere in the middle of
two extremes. “Sometimes it’s
played very darkly, a critique of colonialism, a
critique of male abuse of females," he said. “It
can be extremely light or extremely dar

The show’s ﬂexibility facilitates the int
volvement of Shawn Womaek, professor of
Dance, who is serving as the show's choreogt
rapller, This is her ﬁrst time working with a
Mainstage Theatre production at Grinnell. “I
wanted to work more closely with the Theatre
faculty, and this is the way to do it," she said.
“It's been so delightful to sit in rehearsals. It's
such a delightful play."

To better understand this production’s
original take on a classic show, consider the
dancers, cast as fairies.There is little uniformi-
ty among the three dancers: the costumes are
all different colors, fabrics and styles, and the
performers have the freedom to employ their
own dance techniques, ranging from classical
to hip-hop, to portray their characters.

Womack said she hoped to use movement
as their primary tool of expression. “The ime
age that I was working with in choreographing
the movement of the fairies was a magpie, the
image of someone who collects things from
different worlds and makes them fashionable
in their own world,"Womack said, “It allows

Saunders said.

This weekend's Main-
stage production of Mid
summer promises to be un-
conventional and shed new
light on wellsknown material. “It's playing of
a standing concept in the play as not situated
in a particular time and place,"Womack said.
“There are these worlds.The world of the low
ers. the world of the court, the world of the
fairies, that are both discrete and intercom
