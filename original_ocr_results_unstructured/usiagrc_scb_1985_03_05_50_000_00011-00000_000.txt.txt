EWaging Peace in Grinnell: A Pledge of Resistance

in November of 1984 the Latin
i American Support Group (LASG) was
iormed on the Grinnell College Campus
e in response to what was considered to
be an intolerable level oi ignorance
‘ among so many oi the American people
‘ with regards to the general state oi are
iairs oi the American republics.
eOriginally, 1 had advertised in the
CRPEAG newsletter the desire to
' organize students on campus who
i wanted to take a politically active role
in certain issues concerning Latin
I America.

In October Nick McNamara introduce
‘ed himseli expressing his desire to coir
laborate with me; he suggested that in
light oi recent events in Central

. America. we organize a ‘Pledge oi
Resistance" In Grinnell lowa, He ex-
. plained to me that in Des Moines lowa
City and Cedar Rapids there were a
' handiul oi radical clergy and laypeople
, already deeply involved in the issue At
the time I was interested in campaigns
l ing on campus [or the Student Leaders
ship Project - sponsored condemnation
‘of current Central American policy.
Curiously enough. the substance oi the
SLP proposal passed 44. in last week's
.relerendum,
it was not until December that the
‘ Grinnell Pledge of Resistance began to
materialize. Nick presented a seven
point plan which is at the core OI the
,current effort Furthermore he and the
newly named Central American Sups
l port Group (CASG) began to enlist peo
ple on campus who were willing to com»
‘mit Civil Disobedience (C D) in con
junction with the national Pledge oi
‘Resistance initiated by the editor oi
, “Sojourners magazine Jim Wallis.
For those who had not the desire to
. commit themselves to knowingly break
the law as a act oi protest. there was a
*second Pledge of Resistance of moral
support and legal protest. Today the
Pledges remain the same. and nearly
,iiity students have signed hali oi which
felt it necessary to commit themselves
>to CD. We still seek new student sup
port.
The Pledge of CD is an extremely
difﬁcult decision. one that ought to be
considered with the utmost sincerity.
‘C D. as an expression or protest is an-
clent. yet the ramiiications remain
‘through CD one directly puts ones
.personal saiety on the line Not so long
ago Martin Luther King Jr. went to jail
‘lor breaking the law in an expression oi
,protest directed at a legal system and a
society which discriminated against
ablacks. He wrote from his Birmingham
<jail cell in April in 1963:

lsubmil that an individual who
breaks a law that conscience tells
him is unjust. and who willingly
accepts the penalty or imprison-
ment in order to arouse the cons-
cience oi the community over its
injustice, is in reality expressing
the highest respect ior law.

The ideology expressed by King in
this quotation is key to the Pledge oi
Resistance: the idea is active none
violence, Nationwide. over 42,000 peo
ple are involved in the Pledge oi
Resistance. according to iigures pro
vided by Jim Wallis in February. 1985.
Thousands upon thousands at
Americans have committed
themselves. should the day arrive. to
C.D, But it is imperative that
everybody understand: we who are in-
volved do not accept the inevitability of
a U.S. invasion in Central America The
primary reason ior which we have
organized our response in advance is to
help prevent that such an invasion ever
occur.

Robert 'Curley

The current Grinnell "contingency
plan" would develop in the following
manner:

The first step involves the initial
notification ol the activatioil oi the plan.
Any invasion by us. ground forces
would unquestionably trigger the has
tlonwide plan oi resistance. However.
there are many. more likely situations
which would activate the plan: US. air
strikes or resumed "carpet" bombing
of El Salvador or equivalent actions in
Nicaragua. resumed mining of the
Nicaraguan harbors. U.s. naval
blockade or “quarantine" of
Nicaragua or an invasion of Nicaragua
oi El Salvador by u s proxy iorces
(such as the “contras” ) These are all
ieasible situations which would prompt
an active non-Violent reSlstance.

We in Grinnell will be contacted by
our state coordinator, Reverend Steve
Clinton. Upon notification. the CASG
will notiiy those who have pledged their
support. and promptly a meeting will
be called in the forum. Depending on
when the notification arrives. the
Forum meeting will take place at either
no am .noon, or 4:30 pm.

Among those who have pledged their
support. and everybody else willing to
help. the resistance will begin, The iii-st
steps involve the preparation and
distribution ol leaflets. posters and lets

ters. Concurrently, the CASG will be
contacting the media in Des Moines.
contacting the local churches and the
Grinnell Peace Fellowship t

We will prepare a statement or pur
pose to present to the government 0?
ficials at the state level in Cedar
Rapids. and we will inlorm them of our
arrival beiore leaving Grinnell.
Representative Evans and Senator
Grassley have their state offices in
Cedar Rapids; thus, it is there that we
will join in a state-wide protest, deman-
ding an official statement from the both
of them calling (or a halt to the escala-
tion. whatever term it may have taken.

In Grinnell we will lobby at Joint
Board and with the iaculty. seeking a
two-day moratorium on classes and all
other normal business. During these
two days we-eetl] ior a series oi "teach,
ins" in order to adequately educate the
campus regarding the history of the
situation at hand. the current dilemma,
and solution and alternatives to the pros
blem. It is important that the issue he
treated with the participation or all
those people irom the community who
are not involved with the college as
well. Currently we are working on a
directory ior all those people: students,
laculty and everybody not involved
with Grinnell College, who are in-
terested and concerned about
America's current approach. to
diplomacy in Central America.

On the second day oi the resistance
those called by conscience will
peaceiully occupy the oiiices oi Senator
Grassley and Representative Evans.

We will not leave their offices until
they both call [or an immediate halt to
the escalation. Meanwhile. others will
continue to picket and give moral sup
port to those who commit C.D.

In the days that lollow continued sup»
port will be provided ior those doing
direct action. This will be sup-
plemented by letter writing, telephone
ing Congress, continued contact with
the media and continued leaf-letting of
campus and the town

The Central American Support Group

that it will deter and. thus. never have
