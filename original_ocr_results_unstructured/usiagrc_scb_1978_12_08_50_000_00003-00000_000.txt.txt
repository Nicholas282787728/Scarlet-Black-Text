“Life. after Grinnell full

As,l.re‘rn'inis'ce about my past
‘three and a half years at Grinnell
and anticipate die inevitable final
semester. I wonder, as I’m sure
many seniors do, aboutthe value of
my educ’a m' ,‘in‘ .terms .of its
practical application:

There is a world beyond Grinnell
tbelieve it or not), A world full of
opportunities and neverrendlng
horizons is just waiting tor us all
torso I’m loldl. I'll soon he a part
of that world.

THEORETICALLY, a Grinnell
education would have prepared me
for my debut. In actuality, there
are dozens of alternatives and, tor
me, no clear indications of which
direction to take.

I am a political science major,
As far as the immediate future is
concerned, law school is next on
the agenda. The decision to go to
law School was not a traumatic
event; on the contrary, the
decision was rather automatic and
clearcut. '

RECENTLY however, due to an
abundance of advice: the
emergence of new information and
the availability of new

possibilities, I have begun to
consider the existing alternatives
to law school. What’s more, I have
begun to reconsider exactly what it
is I want from life.

. {Pheonecrucialelementi desire

is peace of mind. If you don‘t
already know what I mean by that,
i simply mean a state ol
satisfaction and Contentment. I
want a life which may not be
totally hassle free. but at least the
hassles shouldn't preoccupy and-or
overcome my lite,

WITH THAT Il\' mind, I must
choose an occupation which will
allow me the freedom to relax. In
addition, thls occupation should be
meaningful.

And last, but crrtainly not least,
I‘want to earn enough money to
make myself comfortable. This
last wish may sound greedy, but I
suppose it all depends on how one
defines “comfortable,"

SOME WOULD HAVE us believe
that life at the top, the well-paid
professional lile, is corrupting.

however. is no fun either. And Lord

To the editor: I would like to
clarify my comments in last
week‘s soil: about the problems at
KDIC. The writer of the article
quoted me out of the context of our
conversation which led to a
distortion or my true feelings

When I spoke to the 5&3 reporter
(after the first meeting of the
Student Publications and Radio
Committee about KDICD, I only
knew that a meeting had taken
place. I made it quite clear to the
reporter that I knew nothing about
the specific issues raised.

INSTEAD OF answering. his
opening question, “How do you feel
KDIC is being run this year?" I
asked to be given specilic
allegations in order to comment on
those alone. The reporter
suggested the issue of drug use by
disc jockeys and asked me to
respond to the opinions of Kurt
Anderson and Tom Raytiel that
restricting drug use would limit the
creativity of disc jockeys (I don't
know whether they actually said
that). I said that I saw no
relationship between drugs and
creativitybutthatlalsokne\vofnu
harm to the quality of programv
ming or to equipment arising from
actually doing a show under the
inﬂuence cl drugs

I did point out. however. that disc
Jockeys were told at the
organizational meeting at the
beginning of the semester that

smoke of any kind in the control
booth could corrode some part of
the equipment. If this is true, then
a no-smoking rule in the control
booth should be enforced. I pointed
out that this rule was not being
enforced, “especially among the
station’s hierarchy.”

NEVER IN THE course of the
interview did I refer to the rules in
general (as the article impliedt.
continually reminding my_ in
terviewer that I had no idea about
which rules were in question.

This may seem like a trivial
clarification, but it becomes
significant when one realizes that
the SPSlR committee meeting did
not even consider the issue of drug
use. In fact. one laculty member of
the committee was shocked when I
mentioned the issue two days after
the meeting. Clearly. the 5&5
reported irresponsibly.

The issues addressed were, in
my view. mostly minor
housekeeping matters. Although I
might not want to live there, the
KDIC studio is kept in pertectly
ﬁne order for broadcasting I go up
there once a week and never have
trouble finding records, news tapes
or anything else that I need.

RESIDES housekeeping (and the
Emergency Broadcasting System,
of which I know nothing), the only
other major problem addressed is
the station log. A few weeks ago,
campus disc jockeys received a

of uncertainty

knows those in the middle are
lorever struggling to stay afloat
Just where do I want to get
situated?

My career choice depends on
where I want to be on the some
economic ladder. Once I decide
this, I can go about achieving the
goal

My worry is not whether or not i
can accomplish my goals because
I know that I can achieve any goal
as long as I am willing to make the
attempt What I worry about is
whether or not I will find happiness
once I gct there. I sure as hell hope
1 do, considering all the time and
effort spent on getting there.
Perhaps the happiness comes
when the career is meaningful. It
sure would be a bummer to learn
that success and happiness are
mutually exclusive.

RECENTLY THE political
science department held a session
at Grillnell House to consider the
alternatives for poli sci majors
who would soon be graduating. The
session was informative. to say the
least. If all departments don't have
such periodic getrtogethers, I
would strongly recommend it. On
the other hand, I walked in
knowing what I wanted to do,
thinking the whole thing would be a
waste of time, and I left totally
conlused and slightly depressed.

At the meeting, we were in-
formed about various law schools,
graduate schools, work ex-
periences, internships and travel
possibilities. Some of the
professors thought it might be
beneficial to take time off (maybe

 

a year or two) doing something
constructive before continuing on
in education. It all sounded in-
teresting—a helluva lot more in-
teresting than law school.

IN ADDITIONI it would give us a
chance to do some real soul-
searching—time to determine
what we really want from life. An
academic environment is too in»
tense and demanding to permit
such soul-searching experiences,
they contended. I more than agree
with them on that point.

Alas, what to do? I think I'm
going to be a professional student
for the rest of my life. Just think, I
could take out loans and never
have to repay them. since 135 we
all know) you're not required to
pay back most educational loans
until years after completing
school. I could just tell everybody
I'm working on my doctorate.

I COULD GET fellowships and
scholarships and grants; all kinds
of government money, Everybody
would stand back in awe and say,
“What an intellectual!" I wouldn't
have to feel guilty about being a
suppressive, snobbish,
materialistic bureaucrat either.
I'd apply to foreign exchange
programs and travel all over the
world. AhhhAthe life!

Why not be a professional
student then? 'Cause School
sucks, that’s why. Anyway,
whoever said I wasn't a sup-
pressive, materialistic snob? I owe
it to Grinnell to go out and conquer
the world. After all, we can't all be
like Karl Hess. ‘

rather brusque letter from “Doc"
Elliot Pollock, KDIC director of
communications, about im-
proprieties in the log. I was
angered by the tone of the letter
(threatening ”punitive action")
because as a new disc jockey l was
never taught that there is a proper
way to keep the log, let alone that
proper way.

Certainly, that problem could
have been solved if Pollock (or
whoever is responsible) had the
foresight to hand out his log
manual at the beginning ol the
year. I’m sure that a concise guide
to basic station policy would have
cut off the present problem.

KDIC IS VERY concerned with
maintaining its traditional laissezn
faire attitude toward its disc
jockeys. As a beneficiary of this
tradition, I find that it promotes
creative, if perhaps sometimes
“unprofessional," programming.
As a whole, however, I find KDIC
to be a competentlyrrun
organization which provides a
valuable service and a great deal
ol fun for the whole campus.

Because ol these leelings, l was
distressed to see my comments on

 

one issue taken as an indictment of
KDIC in general, Adam Sterling.

Mr. rlyiiii replies:

Mr Sterling's recollection of our
conversation is a bit incomplete.
When he asked for “specific
allegations” I mentioned smoking
and drinking, logging violations
and problems with the EBS. Mr.
Sterling chose to respond to the
first, if that fact was not explicit in
the article. my apologies.

Also, I told Mr, Sterling that
Rayfiel and Anderson had said that
stricter enforcement of rules in
general (not specifically drug
rulesl would result in stifled
creativity and a hostile at~
mosphere at the station,

His allegation of irresponsible
reporting is also his mistake.
Nowhere in the article. or tn our
Conversation did I say that these
charges were made at the SPﬁcR
meeting. To quote the article, they
occurred “in an interview with the
Son." Mr Sterling is correct: in
the SP&R meeting, the charges
mentioned were largely
housekeeping problems.

But. as the affair moves on, the
important charges that will
emerge are Pollock's charges that
the article stressed.

A Christmas story

On Tuesday, just hours after the
Memo appeared, a beaming
student walked into my office, “to

they are indeed the ones originally

forward and claim them? Or
