_ ‘, Doomsday machine solution

*To the editor: I just read in your

-last issue and article concerning the
Miilutemen 111 missile which Dave
Mollie claims is stationed in Grinnell.
Assuming that this is true, i propose

, that crinnell College rid itseli oi this
doomsday machine by giving daily

will undoubtedly “kvetch” over this

To the editor: May 1 suggest to you
an improvement as to the servicing
quality oi this year’s Scarlet and
Black Publication. I am specifically
addressing the neglect or intentional
omission oi any sports articles in your
most recent issue (Sept, 14). i realize
that Grinnell is not comparable to
Ohio State in its athletic endeavors or
fears the past embarassments of
Woody's wrath. But I do believe the
interests of the Grinnell community
warrant inlormation about the sports
scene.

I am not requesting a lull sports
page or Olympicesque highlighs oi
each team, perhaps a listing oi the
past weekend‘s final scores and an oc-
casional sport feature article would
suffice. Encompassing all the fall in»
tercollegiate sports and intramural
teams approximately three hundred
members oi the Grinnell campus come
munity are active athletic par»
ticipants. This number shows that
sports are part oi the “news” at Grin-
nell. However, if you would rather fill
the 5&8 pages with pictures oi lynchr
ed flamingoes and speculations as to
the purpose oi the erkle statue, this is
your prerogative as editor.

May I remind you that the 8&3 is

idea when it is pointed out that Grin-
nel} will become a household word in
every American home for this unusual
act.

The ensuing fame will draw herds of
tourists, particulary the Japanese
tourisLs with Nikon cameras and
Soviet spies disguised as Japanese
tourists with Nikon cameras.

The pictures that the Sovies wke
will be sent back to Moscow where
they will discover that this great
missile is, in fact, peanuts compared
their 55-13. whereupon, the Russians
Will attack and destroy Grinnell, thus
effectively eliminating our cause for
concern and many tourists, Jonathan

to the 5&3 to report campus concerns,
not as a comical forum for the cam-

I realized that there would be some
adjustment to the new magazine for-

Coverage ‘baa-ed mouthed’

To the editor: The 8&3 claims to be
a responsible and accurate represen
native of the Grinnell College commun-
ty, Many times the errors the 5&3
makes are too insigniﬁcant to arouse
the ire of the eminently apathetic
students sh p baa»ing about their dai-
ly activitie owever, this time your
astonishingly e1 entary display oi
shoddy journalis Warrents [sic] and
immediate Council of the Sheep
Elders. Two items on the agenda
bound to the forefront of our wooly
streams o[ consciousness.

Last week the 5&3 failed to
acknowledge the existence, much less
report the results, oi any oi the
athletic competitions at the college,
Necrophelial! And the ironic stupidity

Prefers sports to fiction

, To the editor: Having been involved
in a few journalistic endeavors
myseli, i understand that occasionally
some of the copy for a particular edi-
tion oi the newspaper or magazine
may need to be edited, or even scrap»
ped altogether, because oi space
limitations.

However, to scrap an entire section,
as last week's SM! did with the sports
section, is going a little too far,

i realize that some people iind play-
by-play accounts oi soccer or iield
hockey games a little boring, but there
are others who similarly are not in-
terested in accounts of the Minuteman
lll missile located under the Zirkle
monument, or poor Miles Voth being
clubbed to death by a 25 lb. Coho

salmon. If I wanted to be entertained
by short stories, 1 could read a book.

However, when I want to be inform-
ed about campus activities, it seems
reasonable to assume that a copy of
the campus publication would meet
my needs.

rm not saying that a iull page (God
forbid) should be devoted to Grinnell
athletics. I would settle for box scores
and a schedule of upcoming games.

i would hope that, in the future, the
staff would be a little more concerned
about what they [sic] include in a
publication that is su oscd to inform
not only students an acuity, but
alumni and parents as well. Molly
Babcock

oi it is that only iour days prior to the
release of last week’s issue, the 5&8
distributed a poll designed to deter»
mine the degree of interest in athletics
at Grinnell. Has die 5&3 forsaken its
prime objectives to such an extent
that it will act upon unpublished
results of its own survey?

Secondly, the Sheep Council
unanimously condemns the 55:35
ﬂagrant transgression of the most
elementary oi journalistic practices.
Is the sails so bereft oi basic gram-
matical skills and so negligent in its
responsibilities toward its reporters
that it does not even acknowledge
them with capital letters? Surely the
head sheep at the sin; (dan llynn, bob
mitchell, andrew Schultz...) would
want their names capitalized when in
print.

Those are our complaints, justifying
our disgust, our utter lack of respect,
and our total disregard ior your cheap
speciman of toilet paper that even
sheep would not use. We hope this will
inspire the SMS to upgrade its publica-
tion or else many sheep shall {lock to
the hungry jaws of the ravenous 8&5
editors. Charles Bloomfield and Alison
Goodman

The ed't r replies: Many of those
complaini g about the lack or a spare
section in the last 8&8 have a fun-
damental m'sundersmnding of the
newsmagaz iormat. We try to pro-
vide something for everyone—but
don’t expect to please everyone with
everything. We don't expect everyone
to read the fiction section, nor the opi-
nion section, nor the campus news sec-
