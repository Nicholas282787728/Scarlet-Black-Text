He,left Yokohama, he explained,
Sept. 18 and nrr'red at Victor-la, B

some unintelligible Japanese word.
The interviewer held up his hand,
fingers extended, alter mentally cal-
culating that the date meant could
not have been later than Oct. 5.
Kohayashi pushed down the fingers
one by one until there were only two
left, signifying Oct. 2 as the date
of his arrival in Victoria. Then he
sat back on his bed, smiled oadly.
and nodded his head vigorously

By various signs, grunts, smiles,
head shakiugs, hand waivings, and
a few English words, after the inter-
viewer had tried French and found
it didn’t register at all, it developed
that Japan's newest contribution to
the Grinnell occidental life had grad-
uated from the University of Nipon,
where he had studied law.

Expects To Teach

He did not know what courses he
was going to take here, nor did he
even know the names of any subjects
in the curriculum, but he made it
more or less plain that he was going
to teach in Japan after he finished
his studies here.

Unpci has never studied English
formally, but since Oct. 2 has been
doing some intensive informal study
of the language in his efforts to get
from one place to another, to get food,
and negotiate the various exigencies
of life in Canada and this country.

The Japanese government sends
such students to the United States]
under a student exchange arrange-
ment. One certainly admires the
courage of those who come here, as
has Kohayashi, knowing nothing of
the language or customs, but eager to
learn.

Detroit Trounces
Grinnell, 47 to 6

(continued from Pate 1)

The Pioneers made 12 ﬁrst downs,
eight from scrimmage and four on
passes. against 16 ﬁrst downs hy the
Titans. Fifteen of Detroit's downs
were made from scrimmage and one
from a pass. Grinnell was penalized
but once, this being for an off-side,
while Detroit drew so yards in penal-
ties.

Offensively Grinnell offered two
brilliant players in Ruff and Thomas,
this duo carrying the brunt of the
attack. Captain Douglas, who did not
play in the second quarter, also

showed to advantage in early stages
of the game. Berg and Cogan, who
replaced O'Neill, shared touchdown
honors for Detroit, each crossing the
Grinnell goal thrice, while O’Neill
contributed the remai ing touch
down.

Passes Work Well

Thomas, taking a lateral pass from
Ruff in the last stages of the fourth
period, raced 11 yards around left
end for the lone Grihnell marker.
Ruff’s try for goal was wide and‘low.

Had the Pioneers played a more
open game earlier in the fray. there
is no telling what might have hap
pened. They offered a fine forward
beaver in Ruff, his tosses being
highly accurate. In the final period
Grinnell forward passed the Titan
second string men to death, and it
looked for a time as if Coach Derais
would have to recall his varsity
team from the showers to stem the
fierce attack.
