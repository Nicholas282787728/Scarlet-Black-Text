Schilling Praises Grinnell’s Enthusiasm for New Ideas

English instructor
Finds Opportunity
For Liberalism

Griiinell is giving
chance.

That is the opinion of Bernard
N. Schilling, instructor in English,
who has joined the Crinneli the»
ulty after five years at North-
western university.

"I have found the entire atti-
ude on this campus one of vigor
and enthuslzLSm," Schilling said.
"The practice of condemning a
new idea in education just he-
cause it is new is not evident in
Grinneli, The trend seems to he
to encourage and cultivate new
ideas. For a teacher that is a
wonderful opportunity.”

He cited the use of Stuart
Gerry Brown’s text and course
method as indicative of the wills
ing attitude of the college toward
real strides in education.

Taught At Marquette.

Schilling, who has taught at
Marquette university, Milwaukee,
and at Yale, is enthusiastic about
the quality of Giiniiell students.

“They are equal or superior to
any 1 have met in larger univer-
Sltles. 1 am looking forward to
work with them."

After taking his BA. at Loras
college, Duhuque, in 1927, Schile
ling, a native Iowan, taught in
Mississippi and at Marquette. He
has been abroad three times, me
eluding study at the Sorhonne,
Paris, in 1930-31, and in the Brit-
ish Museum in the summer of
1937.

In the library of the museum

 

he completed reference work im-
a paper soon to he published by
the Journal of the History or
Ideas.

This is an amplification ct his
doctors thesis, “The English
Case AgainstVoltair 178971800,"
which he prepared at Yale in 1937.
Through the cooperation of the
American University union, Lon-
don. Schilling was permitted use
of the reading rooms of the mu-

'Duriiig mat period, 1 did not
ask for one reference in English,
French, or German which could
not be supplied. The use of these
references which I could not ob4
taih in America makes the pres
ent article much more detailed
than my original thesis, It is
gratifying to have it scheduled
for the Journal, whose premise is
that the most important phase of
history is the development of
ideas."
