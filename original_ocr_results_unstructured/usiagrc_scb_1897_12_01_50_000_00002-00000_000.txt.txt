Q’rzhitoriul
Spierlng String Quartet

The concert Friday night will
be a ﬁne one both as to the qual~
ity and pleasingness of the pros
gram, and the reputation and min
sicianship of the performers. The
quartet has just returned from a
very successful trip to New York
City. Brooklyn, Pittsburg. and
were everywhere received with
rapturous applause. The concert
is attracting attention our
neighboring cities. Quite a large
concert party has reserved seats
from Marshalltown. Several are
coming trom Osltaloosa and New
Sharon. The reserved seats are
selling rapidly and a large audir
ence is expected, as it will un~
doubtedly be the ﬁnest event of
the year. Reserved seats on sale
at Beard & Alley’s. Admission,
50 cents.
