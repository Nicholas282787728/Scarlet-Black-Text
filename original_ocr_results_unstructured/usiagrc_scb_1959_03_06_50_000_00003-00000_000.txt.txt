, In order to get a wider range
of views'and id as as to the
problems and a. ations oi the
countries in Africa and Asia,
Crinnell college has.invited 13
foreign students to take part in
the various discussions and pans
els at the conierence this week-
end. '
These 13 students >
eight Airican and Asian couns
tries. All oi them have received
part of their education in the
United States and part abroad.
Many of them have worked for
the. governments of thelr'counr
tries or have taken
part in various national and in-
ternational conferences dealing
with problems of their own and
other nations.
These students will

rountries and the relationship
between those countries and the
United States. It is hoped that
those persons attending the cons

‘and thereby gain valuable “in-

Indonesia clearly represents
those countries which today
face the problems of maintain—

while working ior economic
development and the creation
oi strong national unity. Many
of these sarcallcd “underde—

_Airi(-a and Asia, are iinding it

;Charlcs D. Hurrcy, then score»
,tary of the international com—
mittee ot the Young Men’s

Christian association ior fore
,eign relations, in 1934 initiated
‘the Roselll'leld lecture series.
The series last night moved into
,its twenty-fifth year of bring—
,ing the outside world into the
‘narow coniiiies oi the academic
community.

Grinnell’s history at explor-
, ation oi international attairs

extends back to the 1880‘s
, with the pioneering-work of
‘ Jesse Macy oi the class oi
1379. Through the years, the
campus served as. the site oi a
number oi coniercnces and
lectures.

The early studies of the sub—
ject were culminated by the
1934 grant from Mrs. Meyer
Roscniield oi Des Moincs, who
endowed an annual lectureshlp
in international relations. This
lecturcship, initially administers
ed by Charles D. Payne oi the
Grinnell history department, was
placed on an endowed basis in
1955

John s. Nolicn in‘ his history

strong-man in the person oi
General Nasser, and Iraq is
in the same position with its
government in the hands of
General Knssem. Also, it cnn—
not be denied that Mr. Nehru
in India, and Dr. Nkrumah in
newly rindependent Ghana,

have both had to resort to a
more restricted practice oi
democracy and a stronger ex-
ercise oi political leadership
in order to maintain internal
stability and ensure their
country's growth.

But it can certainly be asked
it these leaders are not justi-
fled' in adopting this modif d

Aitcr all, how meaningful is

whether it be democratic or
not? Perhaps those countries
are not ready - ct to bear thc
responsibilities that
demands.

Sukarno's concept of “guided
democracy" was designed to
meet the problems oi interna—
tional stability in a nation in a
transition between a stage oi
‘underdevelopment and a stage
of political, economic and so-
cial advancement. Perhaps we
in the West should reconcile
ourselves to the fact that our
s, tom of democracy may be
totally inapplicable to nations
going through this transition
pcriod. But under this system
of “guided democracy" and a
istrong ”political ~1eadership,"
they may more elicctivcly "move
towards political maturity and
the strengthening oi parliamen—
tary democracy.

oi the college, is that 1he vis-
iting experts spend. “enough
time on the campus ior public
lectures and more intimate
conferences with students."

1934 was a banner year for
Grinnell's interest in internat-
ional aiiairs ior another reason
as well. In that year, the col
icgc invited 110 students iroin
Iowa colleges to participate in
a joint session with the Missis-
sippi Valley conference of inter
national Relations which was
then in its iourth year.

A primary teature of the con.
‘ieren'ce was the appearance of
Sherwood Eddy, speaking on
t“Daiiger Spots in Europe." Eddy
lhad served with the ‘HVICA as
gsecretary for Asia ior the “Y's"
3Nationai Council. Considered a
liberal, Eddy had been describ—
ed as “one of the most stinie
nlating and constructive .men of
this generation. He has becn a
powerful influence for good in
international allairs as well as
in the lives of individuals."
