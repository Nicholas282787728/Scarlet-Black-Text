Smith Knocks Western Man’s

Urge To Dominate Environment

(continued from page 1)

the universe cannot but fail,
since they stress attempts to
understand Nature. Men would
have enough trouble trying to
understand the concept of
oneness, let alone the mech‘
anical workings of natural
manifestations, the complexV
ity of which cause the intelli»
gence of men to founder, in
Smith's words, “as an
amoeba‘s intelligence found-
ers before Einstein's." ‘

Thevway of Tao holds the key
to the preservation of our en~
vironment and the attainment
of happiness and enlightenr
ment, Smith feels. Those who

hold the prevalent belief that
Taoism espouses no more than
a tacit acceptance ofthe vicis-
situdes of Fortune laborunder
a misperception. The Taodoes
not engender aspiration to
nonrexistence or the daddy of
civilization. Technology and
Taoism are not incompatible,
the binder between the two
being attitude change—raccep‘
tance of the oneness of all
and dedication to the none
abuse of the Great Self and
its physiml and spiritual ma-
nifestations. Technology can
ease the misfortunes ofhuman
beings and render greaterho-
nor to an important element
of the universe-rMan.

Wilhelm Resubmits lawsuit

The college lawyers have
filed their first reply to Henry
Wilhelm's $50,000 suitagainst
the college, claiming that the
"original notice . . . is amr
biguous, void and insufficient
to confer juristiction overany
of these specially appearing
defendants.” The reply point~
ed out" that ‘Grinnell Cola
lege’ is not the correct cor-
porate title of any corporar

Henry Wilhelm's lawyers
have countered by resubmitr
ting the same suit, this time
against "The Trustees orowa
College." The net effect is to
give the college’s lawyers
another 20 days to reply to
the substantive portion of the
petition, which alleges that
"libelous and slanderous st-
atements" were ”made by

Defendents, or by persons one
der their control, on or about
the 13th day ofFebruary, 1969,
in Grinnell, Iowa, and pub-
lished and broadcast to the
public in general." ,

The suit stems from an edir
torial by Neil Fisher which
was read over the college
radio station and distributed
to the Iowa press, along with
a cover letter by Mrs. Ruth
Prescott. The editorial alle-
ges that Wilhelm organized
the demonstration against a
representative ofPlayboyMar
gazine, during which eight
students were arrested for
indecent exposure, in order to
make a profit from the pic-
tures he took at the event.

Henry's comment on the Cole
lege's latest action: ”It’s just
this sort of screwing around
that will delay things."

Black Prospectives Visit Campus

About 45 black Iowa high
school students were on cam-
pus lastweekend toparticipate
in a black prospectives week
end sponsored by the Admis-
sions Office with the cooper—
ation of Concerned Black
Students (CBS).

The weekend was planned to
enable Iowa black students to
overcome their misconcepr
tions about Grinnell. Charles
Guy, admissions counselor,
explained that many Iowans
think that Grinnell is only for
the rich. During the weekend,
the financial aid program was

Four students have been

MacDowell Refines Experimental Humanities

by bill Knecht

Perennial student 'dissatisc
faction with the state of the
Grinnell Experience has prr
ompted Ric MacDowell to
launch his Experimental Hu-
manities section for another
semester.

The Section is a refined ver-
sion of an attempt made last
semester to approach educa
tion in a way that would make
students aware that they can
be the ultimate makers of
their own educations.'Ihe me
dium is literature, hence the
appellation "Humanities."
Experimental Humanities
meets once a week, Wednes-
day nights from 8:00 till
10:00 in Main Lounge. The
group is small and 'theatmos»
phere casual. There is no for
mal structure to the class. Di~
scussion centers mainly
around contemporary litera-

ture and is relationsto every-
day‘situations and problems.
Students determine their own
curriculum and work together
on group projects.

MacDowell finds no lack of
motivation among the partici-
pants. Uantivated persons
simply do not continueattend»
ance. Those who do attend,
‘t'x/lacDowell hopes, will profit
by the analysis of literature,
both by learning how to anal-
yze effectively on their own,
and by discovering that self-
actualization is the key to the
education process. By the use
of “relevant" literature and
informal style, MacDowell hoe
pes to avoid what is common-
ly felt to be the desperately
meaningless character of
some regular Humanities sec-
tions.

NO credit is offered for the
course, despite MacDowell's
efforts to obtain it. Evidently,

Students Work For Media

Four students in the Depart-
ment of Communications have
been awarded reporting inr
ternships with offroampus
media for this second semesr
ter.

The internships, three of
which are named for St. Louis
publisher Donald Clark, 1918
Grinnell graduate, are fine
anced W the Grinnell chapters
of Sigma Delta Chi and Theta
Sigma Phi, national profes*
sional journalism societies.
Each student intern, working
under the academic direction
of Herbert Prescott, profes-
sor of communications, will
spend at least 60 hours in an
actual professional situation
and will also write a thesis on
the experience for credit in
independent study.

signments are: Margaret
Duffy, the Clark Internship in
Community Newspaper Ser'
vice at the Grinnell Herald—
Register; David Renaud, the
Clark Internship in Commune
ity Radio Service at KGRN,
Grinnell; Yvor Stoakley, the
Clark Political Reporting In-
ternship with the Associated
Press, Des Moines; and Cyn-
thia Roby, the Political Res
porting internship with United
Press International, Des
Moines.

The Alumni Weekend will be

a week after Commencement
weekend this year in hopes
that the college can attract a
thousand returnees. Gradua-
tion will be the last weekend
in May; the reunion will'be
rho first weekend in June.

the Humanities Dept. fulmlnr
ated against such a radical
effort. MacDowcll acknowledr
ges the prevalent attitude that
knowledge must be inserted
forcibly into the young cranr
ium, lest it somehow pass
through unabsorbed. However,
he would rather operate on a
different assumption, on the
grounds that such attitudes
may make the alternative as
sumption selfrfulfilling.
MacDowell is a realist, in
that he refuses to proselytize
Socratic education on the
grounds that it is best for
everyone. He would rather
think of Experimental Human~
ities simply as an alternative
in educational style for those
interested. He does not exr
pect students to come "flock-
ing to the banner of self-
actualized education, but is
rather engaged in a quiet ei-
fort to remake the Grinnell
Experience for a small numr
ber of people.

explained, as wellas otherasr
pects of Grinnell. Prospec-
tives visited classes, toured
the campus, engaged in. social
activities and listened to pre-
sentations by me Admissions

Office and CBS.

There were a few problems
during the weekend (at least
one fight among prospectives
and at least one argument be-
tween a prospective and a
Grinnell student) that Guy at»
tributes to the fact that the
students were not properly
screened.

The students were contacted
primarily through the guid-
ance offices ofthe various high
schools and through The Univ
ted Black Federation, a re
ferral group thatis wellknown
and successful in DesMoines.
Guy feels that the groups may
not have known exactly what
kind of student Grinnell was
interested in.

Guy felt the programaccomr
plished its purpose, despite
the problems, and he added,
“If we continue the program
next year, we will only invite
students who have talked to
someone in the admissions
office.”

Speaking of the generalblack
recruiting program, Guy
seems Very pleased with the
results so far thisyear. There
are now 70 applicants, as op-
posed to about 50 at this time

last year. In addition, more of
them (75%) are qualified than
last year (60%).

Guy anticipates that tenrtor
twelve of the students here
last weekend willapply. Cities
throughout the country which
are producing the most appli-
mnts include Memphis, Chi-
mgo, Cleveland, Washington,
D.C., and Gary. In addition,
there are about six applicants
from Mississippi (Guy visited
there this year).

The Admissions Office
greatly relies on the use of
referral agencies for its black
recruitment program. Two of
the best are Project Open in
D.C. and Talent Search in
Cleveland. The office also
hopes to work more closely
with the United Black Feder-
ation in Des Moines.

Last year, only 50% of the
black students accepted by
the college chose to enroll. A
mew brochure, now on the way
to the printer, has been de-
signed specifioally to raise
this percennage.

Guy notes that black prosr
pectives are most often con-
cerned with how welltheblack
students get along among
themselves and only second-
arily with how well the blacks
and whites get along. Other
concerns include numbers of
black students and professors,
and of course the weather.
