Finding five
fresh faces

Two weekends ago marked the ﬁrst annual Fil'SKTYCﬂr Bingo
competition, and damnit if it wasn’t over almost instantly. Herc's the
deal: I printed and distributed S-by-S grids oflirsteyears'stalkernet
pictures; [l]: ﬁrst person to befriend ﬁve in a row would win

What i envisioned as a tew days of peaceful friendemaking
endcd in :i fnw hours after Sam Tang '07, Irina Ushctenko '08 and
Julia Meisler '09 went dormetcedorm on an alleout firsteyear hunt.
Soon after, Amanda Fleck ’08 and Christina Reynolds Y08 Came in
photoefinish second and third places after chasing 'IOers through
the dining hall.

I’d like to congratulate the winners and players, thank the very
friendly and understanding firsteyear class, and admit that I should ,
have made up a tougher game. Next year, I hope someone carries
on the tradition and designs a First Year Bingo that rises to the
Grinnell level.

Perhaps competitors should meet [in ﬁtskycnrs in a row, take a
picture hugging all ofthem at once, or mark each one with a loving
and consensual hickie (though that violates the cardinal FYB rule:
“Make friends v don‘t be creepyl”).

Do what you will, class of 2008: I pass First-Year bingo on to
you.

Vegans run scared from Jerk

But as they huddle, shivering in their dorm rooms,
jumping at cvcry noisc, slowly growing hungrier and
hungrier but too terriﬁed to again brave the barbaric
land of stir-fry rind deli
stations. at least they will
be able to comfort tlicme
selves with the knowledge
that they are steadily 105,

Healthy eating is not
the only component of
the Jerk Diet Plan, ex»
cicise is also a key factor. Why not
keep those leg muscles strong by test—

Grinncll has done it Thcyvc beaten the odds
Theyve created a diet that rewards laziness with
weight loss, all thanks to the new student center.

The Jerk (known to admins as the JRC) was truly

a wonderhil invention. By cramming every student
on campus into a single
dining facility. the admin
istnition has ensured that
only the very diligent and
patient students ever reach
the pizza, the pasta, th:
stirrfry and othci carbo—
loads generally associated
with the freshman 15.
. For those ofus who are more liltcly to throw down an

Purses will ht: searched in order to aid those of weak
mind in stealing themselves against the temptation
of finishing everything that's on their plate. thereby
reducing waste but increasing caloric intake.

Yet something more sinister, something more dee
ccitful, lies deep beneath this scintillating diet plan.
That is not the smell ofcharbroilcd burgers pcrmeatr
ing the room; that is the tang ofstudent natural selec,
tion. .

By separating the school's population into two
groups, they let the calm and patient ones grow and
prosper with pioper amounts of tat on their bones

it's to the salad bar we go.

This was their plan all along,l'm sure: to make the
good. fat ﬁlled food so h1rd to get to that evolyonc
ends up grabbing ii garden veggie sitlid, not because
they pairiculirly like eating rabbit food, but because
ihcy'ie too damn lazy to bother waiting in line for
anything better.

The administration is also trying to suppress the
vegans, hiding theii food in the veiy back where no
one goes and even fewer know exists. This way, the
vegans get so disoriented trying to beat their way
through the battlefield of meat and dairy products
(where behind every pillar looms a ham and cheese
sandwich~wielding savage), that the environmentally-

With these few simple steps, you too can lose inches

But wait, thcle’s more! To hinder the possibility of
