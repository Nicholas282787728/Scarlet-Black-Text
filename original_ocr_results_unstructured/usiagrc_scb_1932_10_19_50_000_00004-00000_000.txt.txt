DES MOINES, IOWA, (Special),
The figure of an Oklahoma Aggie
cowboy looms ahead of all else after
'iost week’s conflict in the Missouri
valley conference, the boys of the
Sooner state practically clinching the
15132 title Friday night by Walloping
‘Creighton in a brilliant battle at Still-
water, 18 to 7.
Four Volley Defects
It was the only loop engagement
of the weekend but each of the other
four schools tangled with a non-con-
ibrcnce foe, with the net result of
three defeats and a scoielcss tie,
Grinnell secured the dubious honor
of getting the even hrcak, playing Coc
college of Cedar Rapids, a team doped
to fall before the Pioneer attack by
at least two or three touchdowns.
Drake took an artistic pasting
from Notre Dame at South Bend,
Ind., Coach Bill Williams boys shows
ing little to encourage followers.
» Lose by Touchdown
. Both Butler and Washington
dropped close games by a touchdown
margin. The Bulldogs lost to James
Milliken, 13 to 7, while the Bears ‘
went down before McKendree, 13 to G.
This weekend brings two conference
battles, featuring the Drake-Creigh-
ton tiit at Omaha Saturday night
which may’ decide runnerup honors.

met and defeated the Creighton Blue
Jays, Saturday will scc the fifth Con-
aeCLllee meeting of these two tennisl
and the outcome of that game is still
more speclllatlon. _

However, that the odds againstl
03ng he rcduccd to a minimum, the
Drake Bulldogs Monday began their
preparation for a defense against

ceighton plays and an olfcnse which
they hope will give them the drive
necessary to score against the Blue-
Jay eleven, which is con' red one
of the best at that institution in the
past few years.

The battle will sec two teams
fighting for second place in the cone
fer‘cnce race while the Oklahoma
Aggies rest securely at the top of
the pile by virtue of their defeats cf

The Bulldogs have not as yet been
able to carry out the Williams syS~
tcm to the best advantage but with
intensive drill on the Illndame'ltal
and a series of scrimiiiages agzunst
the freshmen, Drake coaches feel that
the players will have things well unr
der control by Saturday and will he
able to furnish plenty of opposition
for the homecoming game at Onia‘na.‘

Serious injuries were few in the
Drake camp Monday but minor in-i
juries hampered the work of the!
men as they went through two long
hours of offensive drill, Barney My-
eis is the only Bulldog permanently
out of action with a broken leg l'er

. . . the wildest cigarette
you ever smoked

WE buy the ﬁnest, the very
ﬁnest tobaccos in all the
world—but that does not
explain whyfolks every-
where regard Lucky Strike as
the mildest cigarette. The fact
is, we never overlook the
truth that “Nature in the
Raw is Seldom Mild"—so

these fine tobaccos, after
proper aging and mellowing,
are then given the beneﬁt of
that Lucky Strike purifying
process, described by the
words—”It’s toasted”. That’s
why folks in every city, town
and hamlet say that Luckies
are such mild cigarettes.
