The women 5 Gym was a mayor ieature on tile
North edge 01 Central Campus ior more than
seventy years. During its four decades, it housed
athletic and social events inr thousands oi
Grinnellians.

Architects retained by the College had ruled
the building structurally unsound, However, no one
FIRST STRIKE realized how badly the building had deteriorated.
A main wall collapsed aiter a iew "love pats”
irom the bulldozer. .

A few hours later, the entire building had coir
lapsed, with only sections of the root retaining
any recognizable iorm.

One construction man was overheard remarking,
"I’m glad no one has been inside this thing l‘
cently.” This section of the rooI fell 38 feet
from its former perch over the center olthe gym
floor.

Era Ends As Women’s Gym Falls

by John Wylie

Wrecking crews removed the

Women’s Gym, a landmark at the
north end or Central campus since
its construction in 1900, with rely
ativcly little effort in mid June. The
building, which a team at architects
lidd deemed unsound, proved to be
in worse condition than expected,

According to those on the scene,
one hit lrom a bulldozer caused the
seventy-yezirrold building to cave
Ill one of the construction workers
at the site told us that the main
supporting beams had cracked clear
through, leavmg little support tor
the walls and ceiling oi the gym,

Although she ended her days as a
wretched derelict, the Women’sGym
began her days as a men’s gyme
nasium equal, in her day, to the
current physical Education Come
plex She too was beset by the same
kinds of construction delays-Ame
opening issue oi the 1899 Scarlet and
Black complains that “The men’s
gym is not so near completion as
we hoped it would be. . ."

Dedication ceremonies for the
iacility took place under the admin-
istration of President Gates in Jane
uary oi 1900, iollowed by a tour
of the building’s remarkable facil-
ities, which included two bowling
alleys and a 348-locker dressing
room
But complaints about the upkeep oi
the facility began almost immedir
dtely (ind continued throughout the
structure's seventyryear life. In
October of 1903, the $713 editors
wrote an biblicnlly worded editorial
complaining, among other things, of
cracking plaster, a lack oihbt water,
and bathtubs which were rusting
Ii'ol'n neglect, The editorial conclude
ed by complaining that tuition had
been raised to pay for the new gym’s
upkeep, but that upkeep was being
ignored. The tuition raise they were
complaining about7 A staggering Live
dollars—from fifty to fifty five dol-
lars per year, They sure had it
rough’

By 1905 the iirst wave oi problems
had been solved, and new lockers
were installed. The cost for the
200 new lockers and the locks and

keys (8 new innovation) was a
shocking 100 on but a zscner year
locker rental fee was expected to (197
tray the cost,

Complaints about gym upkeep soon
resumed, however. They may have
stemmed from It fire which broke
out in tile building in 1909. Few
records remain irom this period,
Lind/all that is known is that, on
the evening oi April 20, lire broke
out in the gym and that it was
soon extinguished

In 1910 we find several S B edir

torials complaining about conditions
in the gym An editorial in April
condemned the complete lack Of hot
water, and a feature article in May
noted that other schools were having
gym upkeep problems, that some
gyms had been ordered closed by
medical doctors until conditions
were improved, and that the same
course oi action might he necessary
at Grinnell.

Complaints continued through the
’teens. Apparently there was one
Physical Plant Director who was
not completely honest, for in 1913
we find the following in an S-B
editorial. ”The Lord of the Heating
Plant ought to get busy We under»
stand it is necessary to give him
50C every time someone wants the
lights turned on,”

By 1927 the complaints had an
added urgency, Beginning in March
of l92’7 and continually thereafter,
S-B editorials called for the re
placement oi the men's gym by a
more modern structure. However,
it was 1840 before the call was
heeded and Darby Gymnasium was
erected.

The Old building then began the
function She would serve for the ﬁnal
thirty years ui its liie--a Women’s
Gymnasium and the incidental home
to special events, iolk dancing, and
Halloween parties.

When the aging dowager was razed
this summer, her cornerstone yield-
ed 3 boxed time capsule which re-
turns one to the turn of the cen-
tury when lull room and board at
Iowa College (the name Grinnell
College would not be uiiicially
adopted for some years) was $ 2.50
per week.

A few days later, twisted rubble was all that
remained at the once proud structure. The mod»
am Forum Building waits in the background, won-
dering how long she will survive Deidre she meets

a similar late.

lowa College was celebrating its
semi centennial when the newbuild-
ing was dedicated, and the Presi-
dent’s annual report to the Board
of Trustees was prepared as a pap-
erbound hook, much as it is today.

President Gates noted that, bee
cause oi repeated requests irom
both women Students and their inr
town boardinghouse keepers (at this
time, Mears Cottage was the only
onecampus housing available), he
was lcrmulating some general
guidelines for women students.

Recreation tor the women waspere
mitted from 4 to ’7;30 (extended to
8:00 in the spring and 10:00 on rrie
day and Saturday nights), alter
which studying was the only pere
missable activity-no visitors and
no activities outside the boarding-
house or Cottage, Prior permission
had to be obtained from the Prinr
cipal ior Women before Tiny social
gatherings could take place, and
also ior trips outside the city.

Sunday was to be observed as a
strictly religious occasioneewomen
were not to be Seen in the com-
pany oi gentlemen ior any social
purposerrwalks together to or from
church were expressly iorbidden.

Rev. Gates concluded his remarks
by noting that, ”The iree social
liie among us is one of the pleasant
ieatures at our college.”

1899's Directory (predecessor to
today's Student Handbook) listed an
incoming class of sixty students
and provided that, " , . . playing at
cards or billiards or any other un-
lawiul game, and the use of intox-
icating beverages as a drink will not
be tolerated.”

But similarities to the Grinnell of
today also abound in the capsule.
A representative sen discusses the
delays in letting contracts for the
gym and complaints that building
costs are rising every day and that
turther delay will only serve to less
en the quality aﬁhe finished buildi-

There were also notes ior aspe
at the Commencement exercises
previous spring, written on the back
oi an awards ceremony program.
With minor modifications for name
and place. the speech could have
been given today.

Eventually, the relics train the
time capsule will be catalogued and
displayed. They provide a iascinat.
ing trip back into time that makes
one slightly more appreciative oi
Grinnell today.

Today we have the ultraemodern PE
complex dominating the north end of
North campus. Perhaps, some years
hence, my successor will be dis-
cussing the passing o_i this iamous
landmark, and noting that, although
Grinnell College is tar [rom perfect,
it is certainly better than in the long
ago dark ages oi 1972.

HISTORY

The building’s cornerstone yielded

a veritable historical library irom
the turn oi the century. president
Glenn Leggett had the honor oi
breaking the strongbox’s seal and
exposing its secrets {or the col-
lege community to enjoy.
