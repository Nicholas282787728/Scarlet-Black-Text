SILENCE, PLEASE

Undoubtedly the men’s dining room is noisy,
partly due to the inherent accoustic weaknesses
of the room, but more because of the strong vocal
equipment of the men, Talking, however, is onc
oi the pleasures of dining in a group, that is, if
it isn’t carried too far.

Of late there has developed a growing dis~
regard for the signal for quiet in order that an-
nouncements may be read. This disregard has
become so widespread of .late, that it is practic-
ally impossible for anyone sitting at the cnd of
the room to hear the announcements.

Obviously all of the announcements do not
interest all of the men, but there are always some
who are interested, often times vitally so, in hear-
ing what announcement is being made, and they
are unable to do so because of the constant hub-bub
.which continues unabated in spite of the peal of
the gong for quiet. '

Such action on the part of few men who in-
sist upon talking during the period of announce-
ments is very unfair to the rest of the diners-
And it is only reasonable that for a few minutes
all talking should cease in the dining room in
order that the announcements may be heard by
all.

Others want to listen, even if you'don’t, and
they resent your continued chatter. A few min-
utes silence will not inconvenience any one.

HEARST’S FREEDOM OF SPEECH

In the “Other Opinions" column on this page
is a reprint of an editorial from the Daily Trojan
of the University of Southern California in which
the editor undertakes to defend William Randolph
Hearst, owner of a coast-to-coast chain of sensa-
tional newspapers, whom the editor terms as be-
ing the number one publisher of America.

However e fail to see why the name of ’num.
her one publisher can be applied to Hearst. True
he controls a powerful chain of newspapers, but
no one would deny that they are all mainly of the
sensational type, which have profited by playing
up the sordid and almost racy news in this coun»
try. Control of such an organization is not the
attribute necessary to be called first publisher in
America. If it were Hearst would win the title
by a big margin, but in the eyes of his associates
in the field of journalism this is not the qualifica—
tion for leadership. If it were, then the out-
spoken criticism of Hearst, not only by “half-bak-
ed college editors" as the editorial says, but by
men who are recognized as real leaders in the
field, would not be so prevalent. Neither would
the foremost scholars decry his methods, were
they those which are generally regarded as mak-
ing sound leadership. Obviously then Hearst can
not be called the number one publisher of Amer-
ica, and the editorial writer who attempt; to
make such a bequeathment is laying himself open
to strong and violent criticism, and would seem
to brand himself with the stigma which he hurl-
cd at all college cditors—“half—baked undergrad-
uatcs.”

Concluding, the editorial asserts that Hearst, '

like any other, American citizen, has the right
to free speech. With this we can only give our
heartiest assent, but with the thought, just how
far should this freedom extend.

In this country the freedom of speech is re-
stricted by laws against libel and slander, and
certainly some of the doctrines of Communism.
radicalism, and so forth which Hearst annually
parades before the public, libel and slender the
schools and colleges against which the charges
are made, and indirectly does the same for the
instructors in those institutions.

While Hearst can not be convicted of libel—
money is power you know~still that does not
keep many of his statements from being libelous.
Thus in the long run the much vaunted freedom
of speech which we Trojan editorial remarks
about is in many cases nothing but the mouthing
of libelous statements against educational institu»
tions in this country, and Hearst, no more than
any private individual should be permitted to
overstep the bounds of freedom of speech and in»
dulgc in such misstatement.

With the individual the law couik stand
ready to try cases of libel, but with a man as
powcrful as hearst, with great resources, who Is

almost an institution, the case must be tried at
the bar of public opinion, the verdict of which
is represented by the condemnation of Hearst not
only by “half-baked undergraduates," but from
men of mature judgement in the world as well.

And so our worthy friend has undertaken
a large task in attempting to defend Hearst’s
shouts of ‘red,” “Communism" on the grounds
of mere exercise of freedom of speech.

WILL LONG COME DOWN

Several battles over the allocation of re
lief funds are rampant at the present time, but
one looms above all others. It is the fight be-
tween Secretary of the Interior lakes and Huey
Long, virtual dictator in Louisiana.

The basis for the battle is over who should
have control of relief funds sent into the state
of Louisiana by the Federal government. Ickes
and Harry Hopkins, federal relief administrator,
have insisted that federal officials be given the
right to supervise the spending of these funds.
Long, on the other hand, insists that his state
organization be given a free rein in the disposal
of this money. If this freedom were granted it
is obvious that Long would use the funds in such
a way as to advance his ”share—the-wealt " pro-

gram.

As opening blow for the federal government,
Ickes and Hopkins have threatened to stop the
flow of all money into the state if their demands
are not met. Long is opening his. fight with
Ickes, struck his first blow Saturday, when be
blocked a $7,000,000 joint federal-state bridge
project at Baton Rouge. The Long-controlled
Louisiana legislature then passed a bill placing
all public works under the control of a board
dominated by Long.

This sets the stage for a Show—down battle
between the federal authorities and Long. Al-
though, the outcome of this fight is very uncer—
tain, it would seem that Long eventually will
have to acquiesce. In fact, he is attempting to
fight against odds too great for him. Although
Huey has the support of his own state, he is now
attempting to oppose those representing the en—
tire nation which is a different matter,

Refusal to allocate any of the new $4,000,000,»
000 public works funds seems to be a really po-
tent weapon and one which the administration will
not hesitate to use. All the present regime at
Washington has to lose is the support of the
state of Louisiana, while Long will lose a lot more
in the form of potential ”Congressional pork,"
that thing so helpful to repairing political fences
around election time. And with this check plac-
ed upon patronage it is doubtful if Long can hold
the state of Louisiana on his popularity alone.
Long will either back down this time or he will
be taken down. ' —H.H.

IN DEFENSE or HEARST
(Daily Troinn)

This editorial will be, we believe, without precedent
in the annals of college ioumalism. For days, the Com.-
mon Heard will be ﬂooded with replies written in rous.
ing, bitter terms. (Notice: only a lhnited number will
be printed).

Ever since we have seen college newspapers we have
read stinging diatribes against “the arch—enemy of Arneri.
can youth"—William Randolph Harst. He has been
damned on every campus in the nation at one time or
another. Because he is the underdog of college journal.
ism, this editorial is being written.

We wish to say that the editor of the Daily Trojan
is not making a play for a job with the Hearst news-
papers; be will go to work for a rival newspaper group
in June. Furthermore, this editorial is not written be.
cause the editor was given a trip to Washington by Mr.
Hearstino support was asked at that time and none was
given.

We are writing this simply because we are sick and
tired of hearing the number one publisher of the United
States called, names by a group of halt-baked under.
graduates.

Forty years ago, a young man just “flunked” out of
Harvard went to work on hisi father's paper, the San
Francisco Examiner. A good businessman, he soon took
it over and entered the eastern field with the New York
Journal. Since lhe'day that he look over the Joumal
and started his fight with Joseph Pulitzer and the sensa.
tional New York World, William Randolph Hearst's has
been one of the loudest voices in newspaperdom.

During the 40 years which he has been expressing his
opinions in the editorial columns of his chain of news.
papers, he has put forth many ideas with which most
of us violently disagree; many ideas which he has later
changed his opinon on, but it seems only fair to consider
him for a moment as an avorage American citizen with
the constitutional right to express his own opinions.

Wc certainly do not want to be construed as agree.
ing with the man in any Way, shape, or form, but we do
feel that he is absolutely sincere in his beliefs. In New
York city and Washington we talked with three men in
the Hearst organization who believe as their employer——
talked to them unofficially and man.to.man.
Arthur Brisbane, James T. Williams Jr., chief Hearst
editorial writer; and a University of California graduate,
now a reporter on the New York American. These men
believe in Mr. Hearst's policies with a sincerity that
could have been inbucd in them only by a man who
believed thcm sincerly himself,

Mr. Hearst has shouted “Yellow Peril,” “Buy Ameri.
can,” and “Communism in the Colleges” because he be.
lieves in what he says. We feel that he has been grossly
misinformed to the extent where he sees “red" every time
he hears of a college liberal movement, but who can
deny that real “dyed-in.the.woul” Communist! in many
college campi arc shouting “Down with Hearst” because
they are afraid of the things which he would do to them.

We feel that Mr. Hearst's policy in regard in Commun—
ism has done a great deal to help that cause by per.
secuting it, but he feels that he is doing all he can to up.
hold American ideals and traditions. We are opposed
to "Babbitt Americanism"; Mr. Hearst stands for it.

William Randolph, Hearst has a perfect right to ex.
press his own opinion~as much or more so than the
college cdilol's who have been using him as their principal
topic.

mos or SAMOTHRACE by Tal.
bot Mundy. This long historical novel
contrasts the characters of Julius
Caesar and one of his generals, 'h'os
of Samothraco, who for personal and
religious reasons tried to save Britain
from the power of Rome. Captured
by Caesar, Tros was added to the Ru.
man ﬂeet because of his seafaring
skill, and accompanied Caesar to Brit.

behavior after that of Odysseus, at.

Britain as a Roman colony, ‘rros does

Mr. Mundy gives a picture of wes.
tern Mediterranean life in the first
century BC. which has more illusion
of reality than any other known to
this reviewer. It is illuminated with
a profusion of characters of many
races who carry that same conviction
of truth. This is a fine book full of
red—blooded adventure, built up on a
structure developed through omnivor.

THE ROAD TO NOWHERE by
Maurice Walsh. If you like to read of
tinkers on the road, and of sophisti.
cated men who find healing in the
company of simple folk; if in spite of

 

your American practicality, you can
stand a strong dose of unadulerated
romance, with more than a dash of
Donn Brync sentiment in sweet and
smooth Irish prose; if you like the
smell of fog in the Irish night and to
sue the little folk that people every
true Il'ishman’s imagination—Maur.
ice Walsh in your‘man, and “The Road
to “Nowhere,” your book.

It is an exciting yarn of adven.
ture, with a grand description of a
fight at an Irish horse fair. free from
all tiring philosophizing and full of
authentic open.air atmosphere. Mr.
Walsh writes with such enjoyment of
th story he is telling that one
has little difificulty in forgetting the
unreality of his characters who are
noble minded tinkers, sad hearted
heroes and muttering futile villians.
