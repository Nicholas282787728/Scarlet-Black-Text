local GOP Campaign Focuses On

by .1" sun suit w rltur

To any keen observer of the Grin-
nelI campus. the proliferation of
campaign literature in approximate
inverse proportion to the number
of remaining leaves heralds the ad-
vent of another political election.
The really sharp observer may even
note that some of the literature is
from the Republican party, long
thought an endangered species at
Grinnell.

In the 1972 elections, the focus of
this activity will he on the first
congressional district race, where
Congressman Fred Schwengel is
running for re-election to the Us.
House, and the ’7lst Iowa district,
in which Prof. William Vanderpool
is running for election to the state
House of Representatives.

The Schwengel campaign in Grin-
hell is being headed by Bruce Hal-
verson, of the theatre department.

Wengel would appeal to the voters

Thomas Davis's fight withtheState

last week with the issuance of a
Temporary Restraining Order in
Polk County District Court.

State officials were enjoined from

in 1947), opposing the seniority sys—
tem, and preventing special treat
ment for private interest groups
proves him to be a man of inde»
pendence and integrity. Most imv
portantly, I trust CongressmanSch-
wengel. I believe he dedicates his
energy and intelligence to fuIIfilling
his responsibilities to the public,
not to increasing his power and
wealth. As a result, I feel fortunate
Schwengel represents me inWash-
ington, and I'm working very hard
for his re-election.”

Tom Knapp is presently running the
Schwengel campaign among the stu»
dents. When asked why students
should support Schwengel, Tom
replied, “I believe that because of
the Congressman's record on Viet-
nam, as well as domestic issues,
Mr. Schwengel well represents the
interests of a majority of students.
We will present Schwengel’s record
in lighting for and achieving change.
His opponent can only talk of res
form. Congressman Schwengel
tentatively plans to be in GrinneII
on September 22, and it is my hope
that those planning to vote in Iowa
will take the time to listen, and
question this man."

Foreign Student

A scholarship fund for foreignstu»

dents, an international weekend, an
international mod bazaar, films on
various foreign countries, and the
International Table constitute the
agenda of the Foreign Student Board
for 1572-73.

The board is comprised of eleven
foreign students irom Taiwan, Par
nama, India, Nigeria, France, the
Bahamas. Hong Kong, Iran and CF
echoslovakia, and live American
members who have been elected.

The stated purpose of the board is
to provide a variety of types of as-

sitance, including minimal finan-
cial aid in instances where “e,
cessary for personal maintenance
(such as books and traveling ex-
penses) to students from abroad
enrolled in Grinnell. Victor Chen,
board member, elaborated on this by
discussing the aspiration of this
year's board. “We are hoping to
be an organization promoting the in-
terests among the College commune
iyt and residents of GrinneII in the
life and culture of countries other
than the United States.”

The scholarship fund for foreign
students which the Board hopes to
establish would be provided for by

statements are on his calendar at
present. When asked about issues.
Vanderpool responded that he was
interested in all the areas of both
political platforms, but was espece
ially interested in the questionofaid
to education, and the revision of the
criminal code.

The Republican activities, then,
will focus on selective races, not
on general support for the entire
ticket. Although the campus is pre
dominately democratic, ideally it
should be the record and stances
of the candidates that determine the
outcome.

RA Lang Brings Diversity

by Brent Schondelmeyer

“I thought that I was interested
in communications.” There is no
doubt that Mr, John Lang still is,
otherwise he would not be a Re-
sident Advisor at the college this
year. Besides, the comment was in
reference to the formal academic
study, not the daily verbal inter-
action that people are constantly
engaged in. In short, talking.

Books tell a lot about a person,
and the numerous publications that
lined Mr. Lang’s wallmade onowone
der it It was the paperback addi—
tion to the Eurling library. They
covered a variety of topics and re-
vealed much about Lang’s academic
endeavors—mot necessarily where
but what.

Home for Lang is Buffalo, New York
where he attended State University
studying the classics and philosophy.
From there he addedaninternatlone
al ham to his education by at-
tending the University or Toronto
where hereceived an MA in classics.
Staying in Toronto, Lang taught in

a high schooliordropoutsandimmi—
grants while doing somecounseling.
Expanding his interest in communi—
cation to encompassthe mass media,
Lang attended theUniversity ofWis-
consin participating in aPH.D.pro—
gram in communications,

”I served as a teaching assistant
while there, but found the program
to be frustrating as it was too rigid
and over-specialized."

As to coming to Grinnell he com»
mented, ”I needed a year or two
to get away from formal education
and besides I was running out of
money. I am currently Working on
a PHD. in counseling and I felt that
this would be a good experience.”

Besides makingsurethatthingsare
all right in Rawson, Langan and
Smith, Lang occasionally looksinon
the Bolsheviks of Russian House
and makes sure that the oracle of
Delphi is iunctioning properly at
Classics House. He isalsoin charge
of the Revolving Door.

“The slaliis currently reassessing
what the function of the Door should
be. It is no longer used as much

as a crash pad, but by being thought
of as Ll crisis center. People de—
velop a certain stigma about coming
there unless they are really mess-
ed—up We want to open it up to
the community for short term coun-
seling. There is much to be gained
from tactful attempts to commun-
icate with the town on both sides.”

As far as being an Rh, Lang views
the job as availability to anybody
on any level which they wish to
choose from rapping to letting for»
getful roommates into their room
in the early morning. Dorms are as
much a part ofthe college experience
as any book or paperback, no matter
who the instructor.

“Dorms are like 'pressurecooke
ers’ in that people have to learn
how to get along with each other.
Many of the problems they face won’t
be duplicated again in the rest oi
their life times."

Let’s hope not, but having an RA
whose door will swing open at the
slightest nudge or tap of the hand
means they won’t be all that bad.

on campus. This fund would make
it possible for more ioreigners to
attend Grinnell, as those now in at—
tendance are here at their own ex-
epnse. One difficulty in obtaining
revenue from the machines was cited
by Chen, who commented thatpeople
fail to return bottles to the racks.
Therefore, often when the Cocar
Cola company comes for the bottles,
the Board makes no profit because
of a lack of returned empties.
