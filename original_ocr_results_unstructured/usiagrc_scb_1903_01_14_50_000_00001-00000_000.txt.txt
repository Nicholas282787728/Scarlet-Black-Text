Organizations.

THE cHREs'rotiA'riliAN SOCIETY

Last October the purpose was
announced of publishing in these
volumes 3 series of articles de-
scriptive of the various literary
societies ofthe college; one artir
cle was published In regard tothe
Grinnell Institute when the press
of other matters made necessary
a postponement ot the series,
With this issue we resume the

‘series with an account of the
Chrestomathian secrety.

Though its numbers have been
larger than at present the society
has not been as prosperous, all
things considered, since the
writer's connection tvith the col»
lege. Last spring, steps were
taken, in conjunction with the
Ellis society, for the renovation
of the hall. During the summer
the walls and woodwork were re
papered and varnished, and in
October the old carpeted ﬂoor
was replaced by a beautiful hard
oak floor with wax ﬁnish at a cost
of about a hundred and twenty
ﬁve dollars.

This material prosperity of the
society is but an index of its con»
dition in intellectual and other
lines. As in other years the one
word “work” still expresses the
spirit at the society. Three weeks
ago her team won the annual inc
teresociety debate for the ﬁfth
time in the last six years. The
same week ﬁrst and second places
in the home oratorical contest
were taken by two of her mem-
bers. During the holidays ar-
rangements were concluded for
holding a debate with the Clion-
ian society of Des Moines College
during the coming term. and Jan-
uary 25th a double preliminary
will be held for the purpose ot
choosing teams to meet Des
Moiness the Intitute in a debate at
the end of the present term. Al
though tour of the society's best
men are already withdrawn to
serve on the college debating and
oratortcal teams, no less than a
dozen others are now at work prer
paring tor the coming preliminary
contest.

Meanwhile the regular society

work is not being allowed to be
icnntinutd on Second Page)

 

ALBERT SHAW’S TRIBUTE TO R,
M HAINES.

The Following is From a Letter lay Albert
Shaw, ’7g—Editar of the Review
or Reviews.

"I was deeply grieved to hear
of the death of Robert M. Haines.
I can hardly tell you how much I
had always admired and respect»
ed him, He came as near, I
think, to my ideal ofa lawyer and
a man as i have known anywhere.
With such knowledge as I had
years ago ofpublic men in Iowa.
I always regarded Robert M.
Haines as the ablest of them all.
I certainly believe that he ought
to have spent the last twentyrﬁve
years of his life in high public
serviceatWashington. Hewould
have beena commanding ﬁgure
in Congress and would have added
no little luster to the reputation
of the state. I did not always
ﬁnd myself able to take his pre~
cise view ota political question,
but no ditterence of opinion ever
led me to think the less of him or
to hold tn lower esteem the clear-
ness and (once of hisinlellect. On
the contrary, it I iound any differ
ence of opinion, it only made it
seem to me the more necessary
to examine caretully into the
grounds of the positinn thatI was
holding. The college, I am sure,
will for years to come feel the loss
of his interest and of his constant
counsel and his intelligent work
as a member of the executive
committee ofthe board of trustees.

I should be obliged if you would
extend to the family my deepest
sympathy and express to them
my sense of great personal loss.

MR, SMITH'S PIANOFORTE RE»
ctTAL.

In his pianoforterccitai Friday
evening Mr. Smith surpassed the
excellence which has been Chara»
cteristicofhispublic performances
in Grinnell. and set astandard for
his work which prophesies his in»
evitable recognition as a pianist
of marked ability. The cata:
iogue of the good points in
Mr. Smith's playing would be
a long one; antongtliein stand out
a clean, ﬁlm technic, delicate use
of the pedal, and entire freedom
from technical mannerisms. I-Ie
docs not yct scent to be thorough
ly at casein public peliot'maitce,

and practically all the adverse
criticisms that might be made on
Friday night’s performance could
be dismissed as the result of ner-
vousness The lack of suFﬁcient
exuberance and abandon in such
works as the Polonaise and the
last movement of the Beethoven
sonata is not a usual thing in his
playing. nor did he seem to lose
himself in these as thoroughly as
in the Chopin nocturnes; but this
element of cautiousness is not ale
together abad thing, and makes
in the long run a safer foundation
than a pellvmeli race for the
double bar,

Mr. Smith's program was broad
and almost massive in its con-
struction. It ranged in express-
ion trom the purely classic sonata
of Beethoven to the strident realr
ism of Jensen‘s “Eros"; and tech
nical difﬁculty seems to be
eliminated in his selection of
pieces. The Beethoven sonata is
a masterpiece, graceful, whole—
some, and serene; maidenly in
its expression, with scarcely a
glimmer ot the protound em0r
tional depths which Beethoven
sounded in his subsequent works
Mr. Smith gave a real interpre-
tation of this work, and it is to be
hoped that we can hear it again,
Of the jensen numbers, the Gala-
tea is the clearest. and was given
with gracefulness and delicacy.
In the Chopin numbers, however,
Mr. Smith did his greatest work,
and the two nocturnes were playv
ed with such poetic feeling and
absolute freedom from techinical
restraint, as to recall vividly the
consummate art with which De
Pachmann playsthesefragilecom-
positions.

As a pianoforterecital pure and
simple Mr. Smith's work achieved
eminent success, which is in no
way lessened when we remember
that it was done on top of con-
stant heavy teaching and his aC'

tive engagement in every musical
interest of the college.
