Those fuzzy-eyed creatures inllklng into ARH
of a morning are the product of GrlnlleII's new
postwar world, The vast niaiority do not hecd
glassesiyet. A great number are still able to de-
cipher the larger type in comic magazines, or inane
age to get the gist of the tale by studying the
pictures. But. for the citizens of tomorrow, is that
enough? Grinncll students would like to enter
classrooms Without stumbling over chairs. Grinnell
students would like to see their profcssors, Gl'ln-

consultant, would recommend green-tinted walls,
but until decorators can arrive with the spring.
we would be perfectly sansfied with a few morc

night? The asparagus has lost that delicious look

' ‘ahd the coffee tastes flat in your mouth’ Do the
professors seem to be leeriiig at you? If so, you're
not alone. Nearly everybody in Grinnell feels the
same way you do.

To help you overcome the trials, shocks and
chagrin of exam week you might try a few of the

followin suggestions.
