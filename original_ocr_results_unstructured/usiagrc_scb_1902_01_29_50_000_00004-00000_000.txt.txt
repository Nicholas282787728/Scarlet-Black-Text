ATHLETIC UNION MEETING.

A meeting of the Athletic
Union will be held Thursday at I
p. ni., and it isthe hope of the
president that all the members
will be present. There are several
matters of extreme importance to
come: before the Union, and it is
imperative that there be a full at-
tendance.

A meeting to consider these
questions was called tor Monday
afternoon. but a quorum tailed to
appear and no business could be
done. Erich member should set
to it that at the meeting Thursday
there is a good attendance.

OF INTEREST TO TRACK MEN.

Monday, February 3, is the day

for thejumpirig in the gymnasium,,

About two weeks later a series of,
handicap junrps, such as occurred
last year, will begin. It is the
plan to hold these every Saturday
and give the men a good chance
to get in [air condition before the
opening ot the spring work.

The jogging will be continued
by the men who have been doing
this for some time, but only on
the days, when they have no
classes on class days, the jog-
ging is to be orrrittcd,

ENROLLMENT IN SCHOOL OF
MUSIC.

.The registration in the School
of Music shows that the school is
in a prosperouscondition. There
are 72 registered for work, the
same number as for last semester,
but the amount of individual work
is nrnch heavier, There are r3 of
the 25 members of the choral
class who are included in the en:
rollment above.

The increase in the work that
is being done is indicated by the
tact that a new class in Harmony
as large as the class at the open»
ing ot the year, has been tornred.
The ivorlt in Harmony is only
for the halfyeal', but the demand
for a new class was so great, that
the same work will be given this
semester.
