stems irom a growuig sense oi
alarm over the iaiiure oi stu«
debts; to deal with the most
import-ant issues and ideas in
this time or changing academic '
and admissions policies. pro.
posca new buildings, and a
more co-orﬂimted social pro-
gnm," announced Randy Reed.
.Reed went on to say- that the
council has been concerned with,
how prospective students should
be led around the campus,
when its chiet concern should
be what kind of prospective stu-
dents Grinnell is going to get
in the first place.

“My campaign has centered

largely on increased attention
to the desires oi the student

body ns~well as greater at-

tention to the desires oi the

student participation in the '
Council activities," stated

Gerry Thompson

Emphases in Thompson's plat-
form include publication of
