Gridders Rest
After Penn Tilt;

Backs Recover

Mclrltire, Ruff, Rose and
Thomas Will be Ready
for Ames Fray.

Quakers Prove Easy

Pioneers Play Straight Football;
Fall to Show Passing Attack
Before Iowa. State.

Ernest Mclntire, Russell Ruff,
and “Hank" Thomas, all of whom
have not been doing any strenuous
work in signal drills of the week,
will be in shape to play in the Ames
game Saturday. Ruff is still limp-
ing from his charley horse but has
been out tossing passes in signal
drills to keep in shape. Mclntire.
whose hip injury is due to torn liga-
ments, was practicing short kicks
Tuesday.

Thomas and Rose neither suffered
serious injuries but both received
some battering in the Penn contest
and are resting temporarily. The
hopes of Coach Watt at end were
given a slight drop when Dick Mur-
phy turned up with a fractured
shoulder in the opening game. Bil—
to, Briggs, Minier and Edmans will
carry on the work, however.

Grinnell had little trouble defeat-
ing Penn 13 to o, reserve forces
playing a good share of the game.
The first touchdown came in the
first few minutes, Rose following
Richey’s ell-yard run from the kick-
off with a 20-yard dash to the five
yard ribbon where line drives put the
oval over.

The second touchdown was in the
second quarter when Thomas went
20-yards to the 15 yard _ line and
Rose passed to Liedtke for the
touchdown.

The Pioneers stuck to straight
football all the way and uncorked no
plays in which the Cyclones might
he interested. The Quakers threat-
ened in the third quarter by reach-
ing the five-yard line and the Pio-
neers did the same on their own ac-
count late in the game. Neither
team scored again, however. Nor-
ton, Bellman and Black were the out-
standing men for Perm while Thom-
as, Walker and Heldridge might
well be considered Grinnell stars.

Tries New Way
to Record Subs

Truesdale Has Fresh Men
Report at Table Be-
fore Playing.

A new plan of recording substi-
tutions. proposed by Lester L. Watt
and John C. Truesdale of the ath-
letic department here at Grinnell,
was tried out in 'the Grinnell-Penn
game last Saturday. Under the new
method, substitutes report to an of-
ficial scorer the same as in basket-
ball. A table is placed at the 50-yard
mark along the sidelines and the
benches for the reserves of both
teams are- arranged on either side of
the table,

Coach Watt originally proposed
the idea, but Truesdale determined
the nature of it and worked out the
details. The purpose of the plan. ac-
cording to Truesdale, is to eliminate
confusion on the part of the um-
pire who ordinarily keeps a list of
all replacements. Consequently the
game is speeded up and is free from
the usual long delays.

The new plan was an outgrowth of
the recent. Grinnell-Toledo high
school game, in which Watt, Trues—
dale and Duke officiated. TrueSdaIE,
who umpired the game. was kept on
the jump constantly with the fre-
quellt substitutions and a need of a
better arrangement became apparent
to him.

The system will probably be used
in the State Teachers game, and
possibly with Carleton later in the
season.

‘If the plan proves successful,
Truesddle will present it to the Na:
tional RUIES Committee.

Coaches Plan Two Yearling
Games for This Fall;
Stress Team Play.

The freshman football squad und-
erwent its first scrimmage with the
varsity Monday afternoon and show-
ed little resistance to the bigger men
who had already been in practice for
two weeks Tuesday night's affair
saw a stronger and harder hitting
fresh eleve'n, however. The squads
have been scrimmaging among them-
selves until the freshmen bad time to
build up an offensive and defensive
style of play.

May Be Prep Games

The yearlings are shaping up well
considering the short time the mem-
bers have been working as a'unit.
Although no outstanding players
have shown up as yet the whole
squad shows teamwork which should
prove just as effective as though
forced to depend on any one or two
stars.

Negotiations are being made for
two freshman games this year but
neither the dates nor the opponents
have yet been determined. Because
of these games Coach Truesdale ex—
pects to develop a more highly or-
ganized team than has been the case
in previous years.

The same men who took out suits
a week ago are still at it with the
exception of Santi, who was called
home on account of the serious ill-
ness of his father.

Never Take Battle
From Iowa State
Before 1924.

Win Two Since Then

Morgan Taylor Catches Long Pass
for First Victory 13-14;
Two Ties Registered.

Russell Huff's sensational passing,
which was directly responsible for
the Pioneer victory over Iowa State
college on the local gridiron last
year, is again expected to bring
triumph to Grinuell this year. Since
the inauguration of an aerial attack
in the Grinnell offensive in 1924,
Iowa State has taken Duly one via—
tory in five games. Griuuell has tak-
en two decisions while a pair of

games have been tied.
Gil-lune“ Wins in 1924

Prior to 1924 Grinnell went bad”
against the Cyclones and didn’t .win
any of the games played between the
two teams. In 1924. however. the
Pioneers overcame a jinx of many
years standing and staged a des-
perate second-half rally to nose out
the Ames crew. 14 to 15. The Pio-
neers, playing against a much heav-
ier team, were able in the last half.
to uncork some pass plays that com-
pletely baffled the opposing eleven,
and enable them to make the neces-
sary touchdown to win.

Late in the fourth quarter, fans
of that year will tell you. with the
Cyclones still leading. Morgan Tay-
lor was called out to do the impos-
sible. With the ball in midfield the
Olympic hurdle champion tore down
the field 10 yards to get under Mor-
art's perfect pass. Taylor was cover-
ed by three men but he jumped from
their midst, high into the air, and
brought the pigskin down on the 15
yard line.

Ruff Kicks 1928 whi

Meredith Sweet put the ball over
and “Hap" Moran booted it between
the posts in the try for point. Al-
most before the Grinnellians could
realize that victory was theirs,
the game was over.

Even last year, with Ames slated
to down the Pioneers by a margin of
three touchdowns, Russell Ruff came
to the day, passed twice to Captain
Fail to get in scoring position, and
