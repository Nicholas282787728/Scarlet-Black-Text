The invisible death rays, created by a device
perfected by Dr. Thomas J. Headlee of Rutr
gers University. are nothing more than or»
dinary radio waves Radio transmitters are
used as generators for the death waves, but
in the place of antennae plates of copper or
aluminum are employed. insects placed be
tween two of these planes are‘ dead within a
few seconds, depending on the intensity of
the current used, the distance of the insecm
from the plate, and the size of the insects
This new death ray. although real and elfec.
. tive, could hardly be used as an ultrainndern
weapon of warfare. The currents needed
and the transmitter plates necessary to cover

large ﬁelds are too strong and too bulky to

be nimble. as nan.
