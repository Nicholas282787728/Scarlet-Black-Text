 

Five Pioneers In
M. V. Track Finals

Taylor In Lows and lVicKee in 440
Win Heats In Fine Style.

With the Pioneer ulen qualit ng
in every event they entered, Grinncll's
track team made an excellent showing
in the Missouri Valley track meet at
Lincoln yesterday.

Warner Turner made probably
the most outstanding record, when he
won his heat in the preliminaries of
the 220 yard low hurdles in the last
time of 24 Sv'lb, defeating both Taylor
of Oklahoma, favored before the meet
to take the event and Snorf or Drake.
As a result, tlle Grinllell llurdler \vas
favored to take the event tllis afterr
noon, especially since Trumble of h -

hrasku, one ol the fastest hlll‘dlcrs in ‘

the middle west, ,hurt his knee in a
hurdle preliminary. Taylor a l s 0
qualiﬁed in the 120 yard high hurdles.

McKee also ran a sensational quar-
ter on a muddy track to win his heat
in 50 5—10, Getting off to a disadvan-
tageous start, McKee was trailing all
the others in his race at the 220 yard
mark, but let out 2t burst of speed on
the last turn that carried him to the
tape a winner. 'Citulum of Ames was
the only man to make faster time on
the quarter than McKee, running his
race in 50 2-10, but the Pioneer quar»
terqmler beat the Iowa State man last
Saturday at Grinnell and should do so
today.

Laird in the javelin throw and 1117
grain in the broad jump completed
Grinnell's qualiﬁers. The Pioneer niilc
relay team composed of Mark, Barnes,
Taylor and McKee will run today and
is conceded a place in the scoring in
that evenL D'avis Greene will com-
pete in the pole vault today also.

The preliminaries yesterday were
featured by the unexpectedly poor
showing made by Oklahoma. university,
which was doped to take the meet
after having won the Valley indoor
meet last winter. Drake and Iowa
State as well as Grinnell by crowding
out Oklahoma entries were partly re-
sponsible for this. Nebraska, Mis»
souri and Kansas were favored today
in the meet, with Oklahoma still con-

,ceded a chance.

ANY way you ﬁgure it, P. A. is better tobacco.
Take fragrance, for instance. Your well-known
olfactory organ will tell you. And taste—who
can describe that? And mildness—you couldn’t
ask for anything milder. r i

Yes, Sir, P. A. is cool and comfortable and
mellow and mild. Long-burning, with a good
clean ash. You never tire of RA. It’s always the
same old friendly smoke. Get yourself a tidy
