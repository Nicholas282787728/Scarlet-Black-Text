The incident is the second injury due to a
platform collapsing at a Harris party in the last

Following a significant tuition hike last
year, Grinnell College's trustees are poised to
next week approve sweeping changes to the
college's financial aid program, joining peer
institutions around the country, Such changes,
while widespread, will not he retroactive, hut
will affect all students starting next year.

The five-part proposal includes a cap on
the amount of need-based loans students can
receive each year, an increase in funding to
the loanrforgiveness program, the indexing
of merit aid, a change in the equation used to
calculate a student’s ﬁnancial need,and a loans
forgiveness program for students who come
plete a “socially responsible" summer,

Most significantly, the college will esrahr
lish a maaimum cap on the amount oflouns a
student will receive from the college for needs
based financial aid. /\ny demonstrated nccd
above that amount will he given in the form of
grantsThe loan cap will hegin at either 52000
or 33000 for the 2008-2009 school ycrii and
rhen he permanently reduced to 52000 during
the 2009-2010 school yeai.

SGA Treasurer Bind Bishop ‘08 said stir
dent debt will most likely be paid off by the
second element of the policy, an lnCl’tliSed
loanrforgivencss program. According to the
proposal, the trusrees will significantly increase
the money allotted ro loan forgiveness, which
is now at 3250.000.

Because of the loan caps, future graduat-
ing classes will likely accumulate levels ofdebt
small enough to be completely forgiven by the

 

new, larger loan forgiveness program. “[we
would] intentionally put the caps low enough
so that every student would eventually have
loans forgiven," said Osgood.

The college has even instituted n program
in which each graduating class trill he adopted
by the graduating class of ﬁfty years prior to
help with loanrforgivenessThe class of ’57 is
currently tundraising on hehalfof the gradur
ates of’O7.They are expected to raise between
570 thousand and 5100 thousand this wande-
cording to Bishop.

Last year, 58 percent ofstudents graduated
with an average ofalmost $18,000 in loans ac—
cording to statistics on rhe Grinnell website.
As rhe ﬁrst class to enrer under the new policy,
next year's incoming nest-years will graduate
with, at most, halfof the average indebtedness
ot’last’s yeai‘s graduating class.

Thiid, rhe college will shift its calculation
of a student's expected family need from an
old inrheuse formula to that used by rhc Free
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
which, according ro Osgood, “in almosr every
ctsc defines need more generously than rhe
old Grinnell methodology"

The proposal also calls ﬂji indexing merit
ind to tuition increases nnd the institution of
a loan-rorgiveness program for students who
spend their summers on “socially responsible"
activities.

According to both Bishop and Osgood, the
creation of the plan hemn over ﬁve years ago
as the college was drafting its snategic Plan.
Osgood said that during that process he had
