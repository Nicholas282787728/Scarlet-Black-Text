Stranger In Our Midst Committee Allows Five Will Lead N Governing Bodies

BY Chuck Stegl'neit

It may be difficult to guess
this Week‘s profes'or, but his
identification on another page
will be easier to find than that
of last week’s ‘stranger’41ivel'
Heuptmann.

He was born in 1921 at Big
Stone Gap. Virginia, famous at
least locally for its connection
with the Trail of the Lonesome
Pine and for the Hatfield and
McCoy fueds which took place
in the area. While he was still
young, his family moved to
Midland in Western Fennsyla
Vania where he went through
grade and high schoolr

Following graduation from
high school, he attended Slip-
pery Rock State Teachers col-
lege for three years. Among his
other activities there, he was a
star distance runner on hhe
cross country team. “I was sort
of the George Drake of that
school although‘ not as good," he
laughingly conﬁded.

He was drafted into the army
at the beginning of World War
Ii before he could finish his
undergraduate study. Alt the end
of the war, he returned to
Slippery Rock and received his
Bachelor of Science degree in
1946,

Leaving Pennsylvania after
graduation, he Went to the Univ
vemity of Tennessee for a year
of graduate study. and then on
to the University of Minnesota
for four years. During this
period, he worked for and re-
ceived his Phil and also was
employed as a graduate assist-
ant and instructor. He came to
Grinnell in 1951i

He worked his way through
his nine years of college with
various jobs including one at a
steel mill. During six of the
nine years, he had a wife and
child to support as well Be
calling this, he commented,
“I’m retired now."

Married in 1943, he and his
wife, Virginia, have two daugh-
ters aged, ﬁve and ten.

He admits to no hobbies ex-
cept being a III-F! fan, because
“everything you‘d think of as
a hobby is part of my job."
Now and then he helps out at

track meets because of the en-
joyment it gives him.

Co-author oi an advanced
laboratory manual due to be
published this fall, he has also
written several articles in his
field. rcr this coming summer
and several more as well, he
has planned a program of study
throughout the Midwest on his
specialty in his ﬁeldﬁwild Vice
lets—and has npplled for a re
search grant from the National
Science Foundation.
