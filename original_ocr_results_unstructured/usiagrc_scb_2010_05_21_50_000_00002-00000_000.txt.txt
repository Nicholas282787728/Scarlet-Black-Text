Hougland
from p 1

her fancy Last summer, when she was living in Chicago, every day one
other roommates would come home from work and proceed to "play
and wail away on his guitar, being dorky and funny and pretty hipster."
Consequently, Hougland got hooked. She got an old guitar from her
dad and has been picking away at it since August,

“I’ve been pretending to play songs, chords and singing for myself
and my friends." Hougland said. "it's been very fun and I'm really not
that good but it passes the
time. And on the front porch
in Iowa,1 can be all grouchye
pants in a rocking chair and
sing Dar Williams”lowa."’

If the music industry
is too picky for that niche,
there's always frisbee. Hougland played for the Women’s Ultimate
team, the Stickyetongued Frogs, and it was the first thing she said
she would miss about Grinnell. Just sayin', the women’s team made
Division 111 Nationals this year.

“All kinds ottactcrs combined to make us really good this year and
really driven and really committed but also crazy tun,” Hougland said.

Hougland will freely admit though that she's not the most
athletically talented individual but sports teams are always about more
than just on—theafield performances. Hougland can attest how parties
can really strengthen team trust.

“During Mary B. James my hrsr year, the men’s teltm was having
an Easter egg dying party, dressed up in dresses,"Hougland said. “The
women's team crashed the men's party and so I saw a mug sitting on
the table and I was out of my drink. I thought maybe the mug would
be some kind ottasry beverage, and l took a swig ofit and was like ‘oh,
that was kind of gross.’ But then my captain at the time came up to
me and said ‘okay. you just drank Easter egg dyer She watched me do
ltﬁhe wasn't like maybe you shouldn't drink that. "

Injuries and sports do go hand in hand, clearly Ultimate is no
exception. Besides, athletes seem to have a bad rep right now; just take
a look at Tiger Woods,

No, at the end of the day, Hougland’s job with Growing Power
next year will be temporary and personal—like any art, sport or hobby,
she does it because she loves it.There is something that stands out for
Hougland, but the road getting there was complicated at the very least.

After her stint as farmer, Hougland will go back to make a living in
a profession that actually has something to do with her major: gender,
women’s, and sexuality studies (GWSS). Graduate school is probably
in the cards, but exactly when and where is anyone's guess, which is not
unlike how Hougland chose Grinnell in the ﬁrst placeAtrer a terriﬁc
prospie visit that opened her eyes to the tigliteknit bur wild world of
small liberal arts colleges, Hougland knew Grinnell could open a lor
ofdoors. Plus “it was close and cozy and random."

Hougland is Grinnell‘s ﬁrst ever GWSS major and she is the only

one in the class otzolo. Although she originally picked English, she
eventually switched to an independent major concentrating on gender.
A true pioneer, when GWSS became an actual major in l—lougland's
junior year, she jumped on board without hesitation, It was a decision
that threw Hougland into an experiment, one that's honestly still
going on

“GWSS at Grinnell is still torming its own sense of what it is,"
Hougland said.

overall though. Hougland sees gender at play in everything she
does from the large—scale interactions like frisbee and camptisewide
parties to the smallascalc individual relationships. Barring the extra-
ordinary, she'll probably end up back in the classroom teaching after
grad school, but that's still a long way off.

“All the queer stuff, I love it,” she said. “For me, it’s both very
personal, very political. It’s me and it's everybody and it’s not just
gender but its power, and it's race and ability and age—all of that.
Gender studies are just where a lot ofthat theorizing has been taking
place.”

Her favorite party at Grinnell is Mary E, James (despite the dye),
but the absolute best part is the Drag Show.

“There is so much sex on stage that’s just the best," Hougland said.
“I love that there's a huge crowd and that everyone is so excited and
yelling. I got an opportunity to perform for the first time this year as
a background dancer and it was really awesome and over in a split
second. Backstage is hilarious cause everyone is don/t."

Her studies have given her an interesting pointotvieiv concerning
some of the recent onecampus controversies. It's clear that Grinnell
ms a disappointment in many ways when she looks back on her
experience here.

“It’s so funny to be nostalgic about Grinnell right now because of
the shit that's been going down and because I have so much work to
do,” she said.

But with a week left and whole life to get planned when she
heads back home to Kansas City this summer, Hougland admits
that Grinnell has, above all, an important perspecrive on what were
supposed to do in each otour lives,

“Something 1 think in general about Grinncll, and this is totally
what I tell prospies,” Hougland said, “is that these events have been
incredibly disappointing, not even just biasemdtivated incidents...
rhere are a lot problems at Grinnell just like they are a lot problems in
a lor otcolleges in a lot ofccmmunities.”

“But the thing I do really like about Grinnell is that you are
encouraged to try to change the things that you see that are fucked up.
Even ifthere isn’t that institutional path. there is some kind ofculture
here that encourages people to make one.”

we deserve II.
