KUNI back on the air

KUNI FM 9i returned to the air Monday evening after being off
since December 23. The station antenna, located near Cedar Falls,
was lmocked out of operation in a winter storm and had to undergo
extensive repair. Andy Barty, head of KUNI public relations said
the station is now ”trying to get our listeners back." He said “when
you disappear for awhile people forget about you."

Epic-length Memo

In case you didn't notice, the Campus Memo was 21 pages long
this week, Bill Deminoff, Director of College Relations, said: “It's
become overlong." He added that if the number of submissions fail
to let up over the next few weeks. there may be some
trimming down of individual items. Deminoff was quick to point
out, however, that the deluge of items may be merely due to early
semester information needs. “There's a certain ﬂavor to the
Memo.” Deminoli said. ”and we’d like to preserve it, but not in so
many words."
