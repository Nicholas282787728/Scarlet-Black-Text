excels not only in teclrnioal ability
but ina ti-ue iriusical sense which adds
life and vigor to songs which are con»

able periormers. The concert last
night was a ﬁtting close to a season so
long and ditllcult as this year's. its
success was a tribute to a number oi
men who have spent a large share oi
their time throughout a iour year out
logo course to glee club work and they
especially are to be congratulated on
the work or the organization.

Inshlllte th lhe Debate,

Sophomore Contest Results in a Unani.
mous Decision tor Grinnell institute
on Governmental Question.

The annual debate between the see
0nd year men oqustitute and Cllresto
washeld lust \Vedliesday evening in
the College chapel. Enthusiasm ran
high on both sides and the attendance
was the largest that has listened to
an intersociety Contest this yeari
Tile question being oi a drtlerent type
(than those usually discussed added
interest to the contest. It was o' 15
when Professor Ryan called the aud~
lence to order. The question ills»
cussed was: Resolved, That the Presr
dential System of go‘verumeut as used
in the United States better serves the
demands of [he pevpla than does the
English Cabinet System, (Demands
to be interpreted its needs and desires)

The allirmative was supported by
Ul‘imlell Institute and the speakers
were W. it. iletw, W. l-: Lyman and
E. II. Munson. Clil'estumal/hla had
the negative and was represented by
G. K, Murray, L .\l. Miles and I) if
Campbell. Theda-bate was well our:
lined and the delivery on the whole
was very gocd

The teams failed to meet on an)
common iSSuB however. because of the
(lill’etence in interpretation placed up-
on the question and because oi‘Lhe
double nature of the question. Insti-
Lute won on llltei‘pretaHD ,Lhey mains
mining Lhal‘l Lll? entire national gull
ei‘nment was to be considered While

the negative held that the discussion‘

was limited strictly to it comparison
oitlre powers oi the president versus
the Cabinet. The alllririative claimed
that the Pie itlential System was more
representative or the people, that it
was more stable, that it tended to
educate the people more in the exer-
cise oi seli government and ﬁnally
that it allowed or less corruption
The neg-ante claimed that the E ll:-
lish Cabinet System operated erllllllli
iurrctron with Parliament that the
hrglicst type or iiieir made up the Gabi
iiiet and linally that a more Fll‘iilee
popular control was exercised by the
\OLers of l? iglinrl than or iii

The Judges of the debate were Pros
