Football Hohors Varsily Loses To Oles 40-l4

Go To Troudl

Senior' halfback Russ Troudt
of Ripon won the individual
scoring title at the Midwest
football conference with a high
of 72 points. Three weeks ago
Troudt, who was not a member
of Ripon‘s starting backfield as
the season opened. had only
four TD'S to his credit and was
not a contender for the crown;
but a late-season scoring binge
in which he tallied four times
against both Cornell and Knox
enabled Troudt to outdistancc
his nearest competitor by l2
points.

Another unheralded half-
back, have Folkestad of St,
om, nosed out by one point
(60-59! his better-known team-
mate, Whitey Brekken, to take
second place. Like Troudt, Fol-
kestad was not a contender
early in the season; going in.
to the final game, nave was
11 points behind Whitey, but
scored two touchdowns against
Monmouth to his teammates
none.

An o t h er ragsetoarlches halfa
hack, Al Schmucker, copped
fourth position with 54 points.
Back in September and October,
Schmucker was merely senior
Bob Scott’s promising substitute,
but an injury to Scott gave the
sophomore back his chance, a
chance he capitalized on so bril~
liantly as to outscore the sev-
enth-place senior by the margin
of a fourtheperiod TD in Carlee
ton'S final game.

Two other sophomores, Bill
Volkman of Lawrence and Dave
Smith of Ripon, took fifth and
sixth with 50 and 49 points re-
spectively, With Jerry Stonee
harger who began the season as
Cce’s secondestring quarterback
tying for eighth place with Bob
Keck of Cornell and Mondo Lo-
pez of Knox, four of the first
10 positions went to sophomores.

Jack Shaffer, the Pioneers’
fighting halfback, finished 12th
among the scoring leaders, tallye
ing 40 pointsiiil] on touchdowns
and 10 more on conversions.

The nbverse of the startling
success of the sophomores and
other dark‘horses was the rel.
ative failure or several at last
year's stars to live up to their
advance billing. Hampered by
injuries, Coe's John Roscoe
berg, who set a conference
scoring record in 1955, failed
to place in the top 10. Frank
Stanicek of Knox, ninth last
fall, dropped down to 13th.
The only repeaters were Brek—
ken and Scott, who improved
on their fourth and 10th rank—
ing of 1955.

The closer competition in the
conference this fall is reflected
in the fact that every college
placed at least one man in the
top 20 and in the fact that the

20th high scorer tallied as many'

points as last season's seventh
man.
