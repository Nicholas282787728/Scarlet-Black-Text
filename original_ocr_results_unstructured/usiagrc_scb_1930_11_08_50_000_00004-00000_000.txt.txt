(continued From Page 1)

No man received more than two votes
with the exception of Tebbcns, Dun-
can and Holmes. Both end positions
are held by Clark men. Duncan was
probably the most outstanding play
or on this team. His long passes and
work around the enemy goal was
most valuable to Dibble, Canright no
doubt deserves one of the forward po-
sitions. While new to the game he
was one of the big factors in Gates'
success this year. He is fast and
shows lots of ﬁght.

There was some disagreement
about the center, Bath was disallow-
ed by some of the captains because
he had played so few games, but he
is given the berth on what he showed
during the games that he did play.
Rowe was an overwhelming favorite
for the goal.

Work for Students
Given 400 Iowans

(Special to The Scarlet and Black).

IOWA CITYsSurccase from
the unemployment situation
; among University of Iowa stun
dents has been given to more than
- 400 men and women within the past
five weeks by the university‘s em-
ployment bureau. .

The report of Arthur G. Lentz,
manager, shows that all except 100
of the students were given work in
September. Nearly 200 of the jobs
- will continue throughout the school
- year, and the remainder are odd
pieces of almost every conceivable
sort.

Lentz estimates that the students

placed in positions during Septem-
ber will earn nearly $35,000 by June,
the board and room jobs accounting
for about $17,000 of this amount.
i That no jobs are too menial for
. needy students has been demonstrat-
er many times, he said. The list
ranges from pin setting in howling
alleys to hauling ashes.

Preps wore harassed expressed plus

with revelations of bony knees and

The three days of Hades this fall,
and the full celebration of the event
in the spring, take their toll in lesson
grades and down they come in a
miniature imitation of the recent
stock market crash.

DeWitt McCreary, the stocky little

in all of the games this year, will
open the game at left halfback with
Graflund at right half, according to
Coach Watt this morning. Dick Ull-

shoes in the backfield, will be on the
bench when the game opens. .

Thomas will be calling signals to-

back. The line will be the same as
that used in the Creighton game with
Mmier and Hensley at ends, Walker
and Humphrey at tackles, Bradford
and Norton, at guards and Christof-
fersen at center.
Russell Ruff has not appeared this
morning but Coach Watt said that he
would be in St, Louis before time for
the game to start tonight. Both he
and Bilto will be on the bench, wearv
