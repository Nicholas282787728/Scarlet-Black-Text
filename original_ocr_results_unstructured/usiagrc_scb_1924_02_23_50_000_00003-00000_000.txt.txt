perienced debaters from the state uni-
versity, the Crl'innell trio effectively
displayed their capabilities in the Ear-
ensic art, and made a start that an-
gurs well for the future ot women’s de—
hates in Gril‘mell.

The debate, a noedecision openeior—

Roe, Halter, and Euhlel', did some
eitective rebuttal work, but were prone

Following the formal argument the
audience joined with the debaters in a
spirited discussion of the question.
Questions were asked and opinions ex—

CAMPUS OPINION

Tim QUESTION
Why do you prefer the literary society
which you recently joined more
than any odteri
THE ANSWERS
Velma Bissell.—I prefer my literary
society, namely Phidelphica Society tD
any other because it‘is among the girls
of this society that I have famed most

is my opinion that it is friends that
count and give you the most satisfac-
tion.

Helou Giny.—Calocagathia. i prefer
my society because the g'rls have been
more cordial to me, since I entered
college, than any of the other societies.
Some of those girls were friends of
mine beiore I came to Grinnell. The
very fine brother society is certainly
a factor not to be overlooked.

Frances Medium—I prefer Ellis So~
ciety to the others because I have, had
a better chance to become acquainted
with the girls in that society. I believe
it has high ideals and a chance to
give its members something that will
add to their llle while at Grinnell.

Faith Pllﬂleo.—I preler Aegis Soci—
ety to any other literary society he-
canse Aegis girls have made me fcel
the Grinnell spirit, that of loyalty,
democracy, friendship and sen-ice. The
members of Aegis society have made
me feel that Grinneii is my school and
that I must live up to its high stan-
dards.

Maurine Yorzybokﬁlallis. I like my
literary society hotter than any other
because I thinir its ideals stand tor
the high ideals of Grinneil. Its very
atmosphere seems to me most worthy
or the “Gl'lnnell type.“ Incidentally
have we not the best brother society?

“And There The Bell of Old Grinnell

Began to Split the Air.”

 

Last Monday night you were walr-
eued from your siumhers by the loud
peeling or a hell. You searched your
memory to recall when m liar! lie:
that sound beiore and suddenly iden—
tiiied it as the same ioyini (7) music
which is played as you tie your cravnt
on your head rush to an eight o'clock.
“What was the matter?" Had you overs
slept and were once more to get to
class just in time to pass out with
your more prompt associates? No, you
refused to accept this solution, as-
cribed the ringing to a more tritiing
matter or a declaration of war, and
went back to sleep.

The next day you learned that you
weren't dreaming, that it wasn't a fire
or an eight o'clock hell, but the ex—
pression of joy on the news of the vie—
tory or your campus songsters.

"who rang it?” was Soul- next (IlleSr
tion liany were the anxious faces
until the news had arrived that night,
and then four of the Learned of the
college, unable to constrain their exA
uherance, wended their way to the
faithful bell and let the sleeping col—
lege hear the news:

We wouldn't be surprised it they
cracked the bell in their great glee.
Then we might give it a special loca—
tion of honor under a glass case or
something where all visitors can read
beneath its illustrious crock, “And
then the hell or old Grinneii began to
split the air."
