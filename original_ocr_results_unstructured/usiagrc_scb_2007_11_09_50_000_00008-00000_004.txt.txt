for how technology could transform politics.

Hughes’s 23 young years were still evident
on his tanned face and bleached blond hair,
and he had the informal, Obama-styled‘dress
on. The chairs and couches were in a circle,
and he leaned against the top of an unoccupied
armchair near the ﬁreplace. He began by talke
ing about his college days and how alike they
were to other college students.

Hughes outlined Facebook’s ofﬁcial philose
ophy, which he is trying to apply to his Obama
social network. “We model online what exists
in the ‘read world,"’ Hughes explained.

Technology, in Hughes's view, will trans-
form campaigning. Citing ideas like using vidr
eo creatively and adding a new “application" to
Facebook that helps in recruiting, Hughes said
that contactsbased "viral marketing" would be
the way of the future for political campaigns.

For example, on Eacebook, when someone
adds an application, the news of that action is
broadcast to that person's online fricnds.This
notice not only informs them of the applica-
tion, but carries with it an implicit recommen-
dation from someone that the recipient (pres
sumably) knows.

This is the setup that Hughes hopes to
bring to online campaigning. Rather than just
bombard inboxes with campaign e-mails and
direct people to impersonal websites, Hughes
is setting up a network where individual active
ists eonnect with others and encourage their
own friends to join the campaign—a digital
age adaptation oftime—honored retail politics.

Of course, this ideal process doesn’t always
work. one example Hughes talked about was
the Facebook group “one Million strong for
Barack Obama," which grew very quickly at
ﬁrst but never reached i nine-ﬁgure memv
bership goal. After an initial peak, the group
has steadily declined.

Hughes addressed a question about that
group by talking about the function or the
Facebook“News Feed” in groups and how mo-
mentum shifts faster on Facebook then in real
life. Onee someone joins a group, the group
is broadcast to all that person’s friends-but
it only remains visible tor a very short period
of time. If that person does not convince their
friends tojoin in that briefwindow ofopporr
tunity, growth ceases,

In Iowa, moreover, technological measures
like Faceboak nnd mybamckobainacom may
not be as useful as they are elsewhere in the
eountry. Hughes said that in lowa, the per
sonal connections that online networks help
make are easily made through ordinary ore
ﬂine campaigning. Voters with questions or
ideas can talk with campaign representatives
or candidates faceetoetace, rather than going
to websites,

Overall, he didn't see the rise of technol—
ogy and speciﬁcally the internet in campaigns
as predetermined, and believed that the work
of people like him in campaigns was still vital
because the distance between the individual
voter and the campaign is still relatively large.

Hughes sees a future where individual
ideas are transmitted to campaigns quickly
and more democratically through the internet
and through sites like mybarackobamacom,
where a politician, via the interactions mod-
eled in Fucebook, truly becomes accountable
to the people he or she serves. Whether “New
Media"wll.l live up to such a promise, and “eve
periments" like Eaeebook make any difference
in democracy, will be up to the future voters.

Then the man himself came striding out
of the other side of the gym, where i assume
much more of the machinery or his campaign
was kept. He had the usual whitershirt, black
slacks look on, and from my vantage point
didn't seem to have a drop of sweat anywhere,
his shirt entirely free of wrinkles.

“I've been running for president {or nine
months now," said Obama. I thought about
the tedium of such a campaign, of messages
repeated over and over, cameras constantly
clicking (which they did during this speech)
and every move recorded in the hope that it
would be the one to broadcast and turn the
tide, push back the rorces of every other furi-
ous campaign.

The “you” was paramount in Obama’s
speech. Not “Americans," but “you." His Ml.

wildscyed and balding man who mentioned a
conspiracy of the rich to assassinate all of the
best idealistic leaders.

His knowledge of the facts of the cues

Dear Editor,

1 am supporting John Edwards for presi-
dent because more than any other candidate he
has displayed an element oteourage and lead
ership this country so desperately needs. Over
the past several weeks Edwards has received a
ﬂurry or endorsements that provide evidence
of this view. These endorsements came from a
range or' sources ineluding one of the leading
environmental groups in the country, Friends
of the Earth Action, which says Edwards has
the best policies to halt global warming and
protect our planet‘s natural resources, to elect
ed leaders and labor leaders in Georgia, Oklas
home and Wisconsin who tout Edwards its a
leader who can compete anywhere in America
and win.

Most tellingly, however, to add to his one
dorsements from other labor unions like the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Join-
ers. the United Steelworkers of America, the
United Mine Workers of America and the
Transport Workers Union, Edwards was re
cently endorsed by over 1 million members or
the service Employees International Union

how there is a certain pragmatism in oppose
ing some and allowing others. He immediately
went to the same activist after the QStA sec-
tion and seemed to enjoy this argument.

He also admitted that his health care plan
wasn't that different than the other candidates
and that they “all talk to the same cxperts."Hc
just emphasized his transparency in creating
such a new plan once he got to office, even
using some of that elassic politieal imagery in
talking about a giant table, where every group
involved in the process would be invited to
talk.

(SEIU). This endorsement is particularly
meaningful as SEIU is the largest healthcare
workers union in the nation. Why did they
endorse Edwards? The answer is very simple:
John has displayed tremendous courage in be-
ing the only “top tier" candidate to have never
taken a dime from the big insurance and pharr
maceutical lobbyists that derailed universal
healthcare legislation during the Clinton ad-
ministration. Since then over 15 million more
Americans have lost their insurance, and last

year alone o\'er18,000 Americans died because '

they were uninsured. It has been reported that
the death rare in any given ycrir for someone
without health insurance is 25 percent higher
than for someone with insurance. Despite this
incredible injustice to the American people;
not a single candidate last election cycle (2003-
2004) brought healthcnre to the forefront of
the debate. This election cycle, however, John
Edwards displayed the courage and leadership
the 47 million people in this country without
health insurance so desperately nceded by

his campaign and bcing the ﬁlsl presidential

activist about a 350 million increase in funding

the scope of the problem and promising some

for.

As we approach a year before the actual
presidential election, Obama’s sliding poll
numbers could be racked up to any number
offactors. He’s a captivating speaker live, and
even if you disagree with his positions, he still
manages to pull some nuance out of politics,
which makes him interesting, at least to those
who are disappointed with sloganeering, which
he doesn't seem to do as well.

candidate to put forward a plan to get it done.
The SEIU endorsed John Edwards because
they know as president he won’t give in to big
insurance and pharmaceutical companies like
the Clinton’s and many members of congress
did in 1993 and 1994. As president John Ed-
Wards won't allow the big insurance and phare
maceutical companies to write legislation like
they have done in so many times in the past
that increases their own profits at the expense
of the rest ofus.

I’m supporting John Edwards because I’m
tired of politicians who put their morals and
values up for sale. John Edwards was the ﬁrst
candidate to say "no" to the special interests and
lobbyists that have taken over our government,
and was the first candidate the stand up for the
47 million Americans who those special inter
ests and lobbyists have kept uninsuredTlnes
why over 1 million members ofthc SEIU and
myself are supporting John Edwards and will
ﬁght tor him till the very end.

Sincerely,

Matthew Horowitz
