Steinman, Pioneers outlast Coe

by Bob Lifton

What a difference a few days
can make. Probably why
consistency in sports more often
than not proves to be an elusive
ideal

The men‘s baseball team can
readily relate to this philosophy,
as disconcerting as it may be.
Tuesday afternoon the Pioneers
rebounded from an 18-4, 10-7
weekend shellacking at the hands
of Knox to topple archrival Coc

8-6. The JV added to the
festivities with a thrilling 473
Win of their own.

It's SUlflClCﬂl to conclude,
utoictote, that Tuesday Wits all In
all a pleasant day of baseball.
But oh, how that differs from
Saluttlzty! In the immortal words
anootly Allen tn reference to a
miscf'dhlc date: “It was about as
much fun as the Nuremberg
trials.“ The games scented to last
longer, too.

The opening game against
Knox was simply a nightmare.
The Siwash must have thought
the first inntttg was still batting
practice the way dicy iced off on
pitcher Brad Sheridan. Eleven
total runs crossed the plate before
the first three outs were finally
recorded. Not a very auspicious
start for Grinncll.

Sure, they continued to play
the tnandatory five innings before
the 10»run rule came into effect.
but they were just going through
the motions. Unfortunately, a
baseball game (even Division III)
isn‘t like a prize fight: there was
no stopping this massacre.
When all was said and done,
Knox had rang up an 18-4
victory.

The nightcap was a much
better game all around. After two
innings, Grinncll had amassed a
4-1 advantage. The Pioneers

maintained a lead up until the
sixthithanks in part to quality
pitching from Dave Sicinmani
when their 775 advantage
suddenly became a 10-7 deficit.
Consistency, remember?

Summing up the whole
affair, Coach Marlinek claimed,
“We had poor pitching and poor
defense. It was a mistake-filled
doubleheader."

Now the good news: Coe.
Winning itself is always
something special, but as
Martinek put it, “there's
something special in beating the
Kohawks." lcouldn’t agree more.

the game-winning RBI.

Pitcher Chris Wolfgram had a
superb day as well, striking out
12 on way to a complete game
“w.” Martinek was naturally
pleased with the froshman’s
performance, stating, “Wolf
pitched well, He really hit the
comers."

The JV victory was only an
appetizer, however, tempting the
crowds’ palate with the
excitement to follow

Grinnell set the tone early in
the second as they pounded out
six runs on four hits. Already up
170, Marty Hunsucker slapped a
worm single to loft. Keith
Kromash followed with El tripto,
Randy Seeley then added a single,

Defense, not offense, was the
real Story, however. On the
mound, Steinman was awesome.

Softball continues
its winning ways

by Laura Whitmore

The Grinnell softball team
had, as senior Diana Lewis put it.
“the most fun ever playing,
followed by a simply awful time
playing." To put it more clearly,
Grinnell played two
doubleheaders, winning the first
and losing the second.

The fun came in Mt.
Pleasant, Iowa, against Iowa
Wesleyan. The Pioneers were
simply too much for Iowa
Wesleyan to handle. Capitalizing
on the home team's crrors (they
had two in the first game and
three in the second), the Pioneers
were able to claim Vietory by a
score of4-l in the first anti 6-4 in
the second game. Perhaps most
exciting is the fact that Grinnell
turned three 643 double plays.
that' ts three more than have been
turned in the past four years.

The “awlul time" came Willi
conference rival Coc, which is
only to be expected. In the
opening game Grinncll couldn't
ltil anything from the Coc
pitcher. Unfortunately, the
pitcher didn't let up and the game

was called in the fifth due to the
10-mn rule: 10-0 Kohawks.

The second game was a
slightly different story. Tied at
the bottom of the seventh, they
went into extra innings. Here’s
where it gets strange. They
played by international rules,
which means each team starts
with a runner on second at the
top of the inning. Does that
sound normal to anyone? At any
rate, Coe managed to pull past
the Pioneers for a final score 01
7-3.

Grinnell now has :1 173
conference mark. posttng LI 7,4
record overall. Tomorrow they
travel to meet conference foe
llllnois College for .i
doubleheader, The Pioneers next
and final home game IS April 26
ugotnst Clarke College, whom
the Pioneers trounced earlier in
the season. thh the
improvement they‘ve had, this
meeting looks to be impressive.
Come out, enjoy the sun and
cheer on a winning team.

Griffins too much for
Muddy River, win 12—3

by Dave Fcitt
With increming pressure from
the administration, the Grinncll
Griffins know they needed a
victory to calm the nerves of the
big-wigs that were anxiously
waiting for the UPI rankings.
Last Saturday’s home game
proved to no that soothing agent.
as the men’s Rugby team defeated
Muddy River (Clinton. Iowa),
12-3.
When the whistle blew to
start the game, Grinncll’s core

group of Rugby fans know it was
going to be a great game as they
sampled from the Griffin‘s world-
renowned beverage table.

The first half was one, of
penalties and missed
opportunitics for the visitors.
Getting caught for two penalties
deep in their own end of die field,

Muddy River was well»aware mat
they were in for a long day.
David Gerard made these fears
reality as he turned both of the
penalties into field goals, putting
the underrated Grifﬁns ahead 670,
But the Griffin‘s performance in
the ﬁrst half was not without its
mishaps, as they allowed Muddy
River two field goal attempts
which came off penalties.
Luckily for Grinncll, the Muddy
River flubbed both kicks.

As the second half got under
way. the Griffins knew they
would have to buckle down on
defense ifthey were going to pull
this one off. Early in the half,
Grinnell’s scrum forced two more
penalties on Muddy River which
resulted in two Gerard field goals.

Welcoming back Dave Hess,
the backs had a sound defensive
outing, Also playing after along
winter hibernation was scrumr
half Rob Nolls, who was more
than eager to punt the ball up the
field for the backs to chase. The
Griffins ended up the day
allowing Muddy River only one
field goal late in the second half,
for a final score of 126, the best
