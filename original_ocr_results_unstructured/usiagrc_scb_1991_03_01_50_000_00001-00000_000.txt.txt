Trustees approve
tuition increase

By Kim Eekarl

The trustees decided last week-
end ll) raise the 1991.92 compre
hensive fees nine percent. to
$17,610. This increase, which is
two percentage points higher than
last year's seven percent hike, is
due primarily to the {all in endow-
menl income and reflects the
college'scosteonlainmentplans in
the face of a recession.

According to President George
Drake, the trustees and the admin
istration tried to keep the compre-
hensive feesaslow as possiblewhlle
strllmaintainingthcprogramerthe
college. The College will have to
reduce costs elsewhere until en-
dowment income begins to rise;
speciﬁcally, there is likely to be a
reductionin theadministrativestaff.

Drake said thatGrinnell Contins
ties to be underpriced compared to
its peer institutions “We don’t
want to cost as much as other col-
leges,"hesaid. “We don’twantthc
quality of the college to bejudged
based on its price."

The increase in comprehensive
fees is approximately three per-

centage points higher than the cur-
rent national inﬂation rate of six
percent. The largest percentage
increaserncemprehensivereeswns
a hike of more than ten percent
during the recessren of the early
1980’s. “We always try to keep
about two three percentage poian
abovetheinﬂationmte,"saidDrake.

Although the increase is larger
than last year’s, Drake said that
financial aid will increase to ac»
commodale the higher fees. “The
biggest impact will be on the stu—
dents who donotrcceive any finan
cial aid,” he said.

The trustees also postponed any
formal decision on the new dorm
plans until their May meeting. The
administration will continue to ex-
plorememodsoffundinglheproji‘ct
and will Search for an alternative,
less expensive design for the dorm
as well.

PamelaFerguson was introduced
to the entire Board of Trustees last
weekend. She also met with the
DcvelopmenlCommitteetodiscuss
the college‘s fund-raising plans.
Ferguson will return to campus lale

bags to protest war

By Craig Wacker

Last Saturday, several students
lined up in front of the Forum to
protestPresrdentBush‘s ultimatum
to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
The students covered themselves
in black plastic bags to symbolize
body bags and held a sign indicate
ing their purpose.

The reason for this statément,
according to participant Doug
Cutchins. was to show the students'
concern about theupcoming ground
war. Cutchins said “we were not
happy with the imminent ground
war." The line, added Cutchins,
was to make a literal interpretation

the students constructed was one
symbolizing the upcoming death
involved in the ground campaign,
Cutchins said the students were
disappointed with the President’s
decision. He stated “there were
many chances for peace along the
way." Cheney and Bush. said
Cutchins. were “not interested in
seeking peace at all.“ Cutchins
continued with “and I think that's
wrong."

The protest was not organized
by PGA. but was proposed by
