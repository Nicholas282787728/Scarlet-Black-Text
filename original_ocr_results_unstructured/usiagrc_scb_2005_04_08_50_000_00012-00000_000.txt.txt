I believe I left off three weeks before break with my
interpretation of how the events of1965 eventually led
to cared dorms and the extreme relaxation or housing
regulations. I say “my interpretation of events" because
I did not find any headlines proclaiming the “Inaugurlr
rion ofself-goveinancc at Grinnell College”in my three-
hour perusal of the SQfB archives. I blame my failure
partly on my procrastination,qu mostly on the
student(s) who invented selfrgovernaircc for
not ascribing it with a recognizable name
that could have been used in the headlines
for my benefit.

At any rate,I didn't have access to the
sen; archives from home, so the oiigms
ofscif-governance me still an enigma to
me. Hence, 1 am going to use the ncvt /
twtrthirds of my column to consolir
date some students’ oprnrorrs on the
current state of selfrgovernance. My
research rs statistically unsound and
neither my sample nor the opinions
presented here are representative of the student body as
a whole. I will use no direct quotes, as the students I am
citing did not give me permission to use their opinions
in_ this column and my recollection of these conversa-
tions is unlikely to be completely accurate. However, I
believe I have a good idea of the general sentiments of
the students I have spoken with.

Some students believe that self-governance is cur—
rently nonexistent. They feel the administration has
overstepped its bounds by allowing police into the
dorms to arrest students The administration is too
quick to turn students over to the police, they say, and
too unwilling to resolve internal problems internally

A survey of your self-governance views

Less seriously, but more generally relevant, the “‘ildmlnlS’
nation” (whoever the hell that is) does not give students
complete ownership or their living spaces. lanitors clean
all common areas five days a week. so students must keep
all personal belongings in their rooms or risk having
them trashed. Students are not allowed to paint or nail
things into their walls without risking a fine. The main
argument here is that itsttidcnts were allowed more
freedom over, and more responsibility towards their
phvsical space, they would be forced to negotiate
issues with their rlormmates
and would be engaging in

trtic selfrgovernance

lemg students full reiporiSlb/llty

tain restrictions on their actions, but are more fnrstrated
that they don‘t know what the consequences ofcach ac-
tion arc.Whar happens ifI’m caught drinking? 1ft drink
myselfinto the hospital, will I be sent to Jeri Krohn? If
I am sent to her, what will my punishment be? will 1

and they want the school to decide

of how their actions aflect others if they were forced to

fines deducted from a housing deposir paid months

g Most of the students I’ve talked to tend to be more in
the middle. They don’t think self-governance is entirely
a tale spurt to encourage prospics such as themselves to
choose Grinnell as the recipient of their college fund, brrt
they also dont believe it exists in all its (supposed) glory.

fourrycarrolds at the preschool run to the teachers to ﬁx
their problems and the teachers tell them to solve it on
their own.Those kids won't always have a teacher to ﬂu]
to and we won’t always have an RLC to turn to. We need
to learn how to deal with problems on our 0wa even If
it’s uncomfortable. As Anais Nin once said “And the day
came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more
painful dran the risk It took to blossom."We are at the
blossoming point.

Spring cleaning your off-campus house

Robins chirping, trees budding, class work slip»
ping. Yes, it's that time of year again. Every spring,
many poor souls embark on the toil and tedium that is
spring cleaning. Those ofus who returned from break
to find our apartments dirtier, snrellier, and darker
than we remembered have also begun fanaticizing
about Mr, Clean. But really, "spring cleaning" sounds
dreary, doesn’t it? Then forget it, and
declare instead the Carnival of Clean
Challenge! Wowl Doesn’t that sound
way funner? , .

The events of this challenge will ‘i , _
not only prepare any off-campus '
abode to make the most of the warm
months. but will also provide
hours ofwholesome fun and
fierce competition for house-
mates and any other unfor—
tunates you can sucker in.

To begin your Carnival of

Clean Challenge, you need

two teams of competitors,

an official judge, a sheet ofgold star stickers, and two
camels (optional).

I) Sweater Swimsuit Sort. This first event will
prepare you for your day of exciting competition. Each
team is assigned a room and all the clothes therein.
At the go signal, each team begins sorting ever-y arr
ticle of clothing into one of two piles: winter clothes
and summer clothes.Thc first team to sort all of the

clothes in their room gets a gold star. Put all of the
winter clothes into large garbage bags: they will be
needed later, As for the summer clothes...

1.5) TankTop Treasure Hunt. Go to the opposite
team’s pile ofsummer clothes, Each competitor picks
out the most summery clothes he or she can find:
short shorts, wil’e heaters, hot pants, tube tops, really
short shorts.Thejudgc awards a gold star to the most
fashionable team.

2) Window Weight Lifting. Now that you
yourself are prepared for summer, you may begin
preparing your apartment. First, the windows. Each
team—oh wait. .. I forgot about all the bugs, Umm...
Let‘s do:

1.7) Dead Bug Shuttle Run. Place a bucket

in a central location in the apartment, Assign on

team to boxelder bugs (the long black and red

ones) and the other team to lady beetles

(the round black and red ones). Note:

There is no strategic advantage to one

or the other insect, they die on the wins

dowsills in equal numbers. At the “go"

signal, (cams begin gathering carcasses of the appro-

priate type and bring them one at a time back to the

bucket. The first team to gather all the dead bugs of
their type gets a gold star. Now back to;

2) Window weight Lifting. Each ream is assigned
a window, At the "go" signal, you open the window.
That's all.T|i<: first team to open their window earns
a gold star.

3) Grillathon. Now for a small break. Fire Ilp
the grill. Use those winter clothes for fuel. Each team
must whip up yummy hamburgers (or Boca Burgers).
The judge awards gold stars for taste, size, and style.

4) Front Porch Shufﬂeboard. The rules for
shuffleboard are sophisticated, complex, and have
nothing to do with this event. Teams line up at either
end of the porch. competitors take turns pushing
furniture around, throwing excess furniture our to the
curb, digging old beer cans out from under the porch,
and so on.The judge awards up to five stars based on
his or her own arbitrary system.

5) Binge Purge. For this event, invite a tow
more friends to join each team; alcohol poisoning is
bad. Round up all the alcohol in that apartment that
doesn't quality as spring-like. spring-like alcohol in—
cludes wine coolers, cold beer, rum, and anything fruit
ﬂavored. Nonrspringrlike alcohol includes warm beer,
I-Iawkeye vodka and that pumpkin ale youjust got on
sale at McNally’s. Divide the alcohol into two equal
portions DrinkThe judge awards as many gold stars
as necessary for style, speed, quantity, and bribery.

Congratulations! You have completed the Carnir
val otClean Challenge! Now you and your apartment
are so ready for spring. on yeah, and the team with
the most gold stars gets a wonderful prize: some pret-
ty stickers, the satisfaction of knowing they've done
their job well, and (optional) two live camels.

The PEC needs more bikes

The PEC bugs me, Every time 1 go to work out,
almost all of the cardio equipment is being used and
it’s not uncommon that I will have to wait to use the
one] want. There are probably less than 20 tread-
mills/exercise bikes, etc., in the entire building - fewer
or which function properly It would be one thing if
I chalked it up to the fact that we aren’t a big athletic
school and the athletic facilites just aren’t a priority.
However, there are torts of weight machines that are
often not being used by anybody. Weight training is
important, but the ratio of regular cardio madrines
and other types of equ ipnient is blatantly unbalanced.
Come on, Grinnell. It’s not like we aren't paying
enough to be able to get some exercise once in a while
. without having to wait.Thanks!

The world is my toilet

Some people seem to be under the misconcep-
tion that due to physiological differences between
men and women, it must be diﬂieult or impossible
for women to piss outside. Some people hold a
grudge against men who piss outside on account of
these physiological differences. I'm happy to say that
1 (and many women I know) got over our penis envy
years ago, and piss outside, in the woods or in the
street, on a very regular basis. I’ve pissed from the
PEC to Steiner and many places between. Ive pissed
ott abalcony. Screw physiologicaldifferences, enjoy
nature. The world is my toilet too
