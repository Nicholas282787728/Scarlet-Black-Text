Can you spare a million?

Why solving the world’s problems takes more than throwing money at them

The menu British film Minibar, by Danny Boyle and Frank
Cottrell Boyce, is a parable of sorts in which Christian charity,
represented in the loving and wide—eyed
seven yeai old ciiaiacter Damien, is meant
to triumph over cynical attitudes about
charitable organizations seen in Dantien’s
brother.

Critics have lauded this film as pro-
moting the credo ”choose life," which
seems to me entirely orttopic, as does the
filmmaker's bail mot that his film is about
“believing in people.”

In fact, I think this film raises more problems than it solves
about the concept ofcharity; I think it should make us think more
carefully about just what it means to give, in a world in which
requests for giving are incessant and emotionally charged, and in
which charity is forever seen as an act of rich giving (mostly mon-
etarily) to poor.

Americans, constantly inundated with requests for charity give
generously and often indiscriminately to any organization that
tugs at our heartstrings.This way ofgiving rarely leads to sustain-
able change.

We need to closely examine the complexity of charityThe inc
correct assumption that rich give to poor without gaming any
thing in return puts value entirely on monetary gain and economic
progress.

In giving money to organizations. we are responsible for their
actions. An organization that aids some people
may directly or indirectly distavcr others.

I’m not arguing that we should not give to charity. it is integral

Another way to give is through
service, a theme frequently addressed
at last week's symposium on genocide.
Many of the speakers talked about the importance of charitable
work both in their lives and the lives of others.

But we also have to keep in mind that many international ser-
vice organizations strive to impose Western practices and values
on otlicr cultures. I'm not preaching radical cultural relativism, nor
am I arguing that we should not give to, or serve with, charities.

I am hoping, though, that before you drop
another dollar in a supermarket collection box,
before you send another check by internet to
some relief organization, that you Will research
the organization and reﬂect on both its mission

You should not feel ashamed to say no. The
film Mil/mgr tries to move us beyond cynicism,
encourage us to give almost indiscriminately to
those in need and “to belicvc in people" accord

amount of ivariness.

Good charity is enlightened charity. Give wisely.

Say no to ‘the Joe’

Students should embrace self-definition and reject administration’s nickname

Most of us have encountered the middle-aged parent who
avidly believes that raising the roof is still cool, or who “get
out their dancing shoes" for the “Electric
Slide” at weddings. Their enthusiastic at-
tempts at being “hip" are endearing at first,
but ohrso maddening over time.

Eventually, irritation exceeds the limits
of tolerance, and all hell breaks loose. Let's
just say that some serious shit is about to
go down among snidcnts, middlCragt‘d
administrators and “the Joe."

— we at the sins want to apologize,
Last week, on the front page, we par
rotcd administration slang and run
the unfortunate headline “Catering
to new needs at the Joe" The Joe. It’s
hard to think of a moniker so seduc—
tively simple, and still so unbelievably
annoying.

We admit to perpetuating the
shamelessly uncool nickname for the
Joe Rosenfield ‘25 Campus Center.
Responsibility for coining it, however,
certainly lies else

A simple Grinncll site search reveals that [ll/76’ Campus Center has the

the term was first publicly invoked in the July
15, 2004 Lazlrz/Lt'aﬁ announcing the ground-
breaking ceremony for the Campus Center.
“Scoop some grounds at ‘the Joe’" the docu—
ment evcr-so-clcvctly proclaims.

The implications of saying the “J” word
extend far beyond questions orlamcnessThe
administration has already regularly raised
tuition in spite of student protest, stripped the student body
or much ofits self-governing power and allowed an arrest ofa

student for 3 Plans posting. Now, it wants in an out intimate
conversations,

Today Mary B. James embodies Grinncll's rebellious spirit.
students came up with the meaning and deﬁned its style, so we
feel a deep connection between the name and who we are. Or
more simply, we're committed to something we helped create.

However, when we bring “the Joe" into our headlines or let

it seep into our everyday conversation, we make it acceptable for
administration propagandists to dictate our identity. We stop
being iconoclastic activists, and start becoming docile wannabes
who, well, don't mind the thought of scooping grounds at "the
Joe." .
Devoid of character, the administration's nickname is tops
rcscntative of Grinnell’s emerging corporate culture. The John
Chrystal Center may be convenient, but it‘s
not charming like Mears Cottage. And stit-
dent-controlled thermostats cannot cancel
out the cold sterility of the East Campus
dorms,

Finally, the Campus Center has the po-
tential of ending up like a super WalMsrt,
housing everything students need, but as
maining an unpleasant attraction.

To pave a different way—our way—we
have to own our campus and reclaim self-
goveinance. Rejecting “the Joe” to form our own lingo would
be a good start.
