t milers, Adrienne Von Glatz
and Helen Randall, placed second
with 13:2 3.9 and third with 14313

achieved her best time.

Tough competition stopped the

any top honors. Tave finished in
lourth place in the 440 yd. dash.
Mary JoiFader. a 220 specialist,
clocked her best time in an ex-

breaking the school record by one
tenth of a second and took ﬁfth
place. Fifth place was also taken
by the mile relay team (Tave,
Henken, Cragg and Stidley).
Although the team did not place
as high as they Wished, there was a
lot of satisfaction received from
personal improvements The in
door season is considered to be
warm up for the outdoor track
season. The experience gained
from working together these past
two months will certainly help in

decusion to Iowa State,

The slick PEC courts proved
advantageous for Dan Edwards

in the first singles position, The
other winner tor Grinnell was Jim
Strickler. 3 Victor at fifth singles.

The rest of the Pioneer lineup
consisted of Carter Newton. second
singles; Eric Christiansen, fourth.
and Bennett Bartlett, sixth. Eds
cards and Newton comprised the

lirst doubles team; Topper-
Christiansen were second, and
Strickler-Bartlett played third
doubles.

The match was closer than ind
linal score indicates Joe Topper,
playing third singles, lost two close
sets 57. 5A7 and other sets were lost
by just as narrow scores. It was a
disappointing match to lose. But
the outlook for tuture matches is
hopeful because Grinnell seemed
able to match its talent against
iowa State, a Big Eight school.

resumes match play followmg
spring vacation.
