lFIFIldlELV. February 9., 1996

a period of public service.

The buzz words for Washington
Republicans for the last two years
have been “tax cuts.” charging that
Clinton only wants to raise taxes and
spend more money. In reality, Clin-
ton'sfirstbudgetincreasedtheEai-tied
Income Tax Credit, giving tax cuts
to those who really need them— the
working middle class. 21 million
workers and families that make less
than $28,500 a year will receive an
average of $1,400 in tax cuts en~
ablrng over a million families to rise
above the poverty line.

The Clinton Administrationhas
also been tough on America’s crime.
He signed the Violence Against
Women Act. which combats sexual
and domestic violence. The Brady
Bill. which requires a fiveday waitr
ing period and background check on
anyone purchasing a handgun, has
already stopped 45.000 convicted
felons from buying handguns.

Democrats have increased the
frachise through the Motor Voter
Bill, a billwliich makes registering to
vote much easier, increases the accu—
racy ofregistmtion rolls, andencourr
ages all people to vote. The League
of Women Voters announced that
this act increased the number of reg—
istered voters by nearly five million
since Jan. lst, 1995.

In the area of reproductive
health, Clinton has been working
diligently to protect women‘s rights.
The President repealed the law that
restrictednbortioncouncelingaLl'cdr
erallyfunded family planningclinics
known as the “Gag Rule," He rc—
voked the import ban on RUAiSé
and signed such bills as the Freedom
of Access to Clinic Entrances Act
andtheNationalInstitutesofHealrh

Revitalization Act.

Protection of the environ
merit was one of the issues upon
which the President basedhis cam—
paign in 1992, and he is keeping
those promises. To make govern.
ment environmental programs
more efficient, Clinton has en—
dorsed a comprehensive set of ac
tions that would require greater
responsibility toward the env iron—
ment. He has worked to conserve
the ancient forests in the North-
west aiid increased the require»
merits for businesses to inform the
community of any toxic wastes
that riiay have been left in the
area. He has worked to protect the
California Desert and instigated
wetlands reform.

Our purpose in writing this
article is not to tell indivrduals on
campus how they shou Id vote. Our
purpose is to inform everyone of
the principles that the President
and other Democrats are commit»

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

“The modern state sits at the
vortex of the structures of violence
The state is the pivot around which
spins [the] structures of violence as
well as the consciousness and ideolr
ogyofviolence." M L. l-landa. Mair
ifesto for a Peaceful World.

livon't be voting this year, and it
seems to me ihat refusal to particl~
pale in these nationalelections is the
most reasonable and directly polltlr
cal thingI undo. I am liritvotiiiglot
tinny reasons, hut 1 would like to
mention three which I [lunk are par—
ticularlysignificanr first, Idon‘twant
to be a part of the social contract,
second, voting co-opts people and
makes real change impossible; and
third, there is no rational choice.

When I vote. 1 enter into a so»
cial contract with the government.
The government is now my govern—
ment; it represents me. When it ex«
ecutes someone, I am responsible.
when it slaughters 300,000 people in
Iraq (or imposes sanctions killing
500,000 more), I am responsible. I
am sickened by that responsibility.

Governments exist by force and
violence. our government, by Virtue
of its status as the richest and most
powerful, is responsible for the most
Violence. Martin Luther King called
it “the most violent government in
the history of the world.” 1 think that
a rational reading of both our history
and our present policy Will confirm
this assessment.

So why not try to limit the scale
of the violenceI Because: “When I
choose between the lesser of two
evils, I quickly forget that I have
chosen eVil." All goveniment offi—
cials, in order to be elected, must
swear an oath to the United States.
This iingoism represents and mani»
fests itselfas inhumanity. “My coiin»
try before all others" iustiries wars
and violence, and I want no part ofit.

My second point is that voting is
an opiate against real participa«
tion in creating Cliangc.The
question I ask lnyself is
this: will change come
from human beings or
from structures and lnr
stitutions? It seems
to me that change
is not the responslr
lsility of govern.
liient, but of pro.
ple. Government
iiill only change
when enough peor

ple change. The point of govern.
merit is to maintain the status quo

Now, the Scarlet and Black etc., or
I can even start my own group. In
these groups, I ivill nothave to com—
promise my principles I can work
through these groups to change opin<
ions and lives Ifthe people change,
government will. eventually, have
no choice.

But ifl work through govern—
mentstructures. voting and all that,
I necessarily place a significant por—
tion of my conscience into the deep
freeze: I know that Iraqis. Panama»
nians, Orenadans. Somalis. Leba»
nese, Haitans, and capital prisoners
(people our govctnment has mut—
dered in the past 15 years alone) are
all humanbeings with intrinsic worth
at least equal to mine. I will not use

ed to zero.

Mostpeopleonlyvote,andthey
think that they have done enough,
and they think that they have made
a choice. But both sides represent
the privileged. and both sides are
willingtokillotherhumanbcingsto
protect that privilege. This is the
entire point of nation states.

But on to my third point: There
is no choice. To be honest, I think
thatthe Republicans representabet-
ter option. judged objectively from
the perspective of the world‘s poor. I
doubt that Bush could have passed
NAFTA so easily; I doubt that Bush
could have gotten so much support
for the FBI enhancement act; I doubt
that Bush would have raped Haiti in
the way that Clinton has; I doubt
that Bush would have been able to

increase military aid to Indonesia
and Turkey (so that they can more
effectively slaughter the Timorese
and Kurds, respectively): and Bush
was not particularly interested in
the World Bank and IMF, which
Clinton‘s minions use to pillage and
extort at ivill. It is important to real»
ize that our nation is only 4 8% of

can? The human ch0icc is fat from
obvious.

Clinton presided over murders
in Arkansas, and worked to see the
death penalty extended. He argued
against equalizing the crack—powder
dichotomy which locks up crack of—
fenders (mostly black) for IOOtimes
as long as powder offenders (mostly
white) Talk about playing the met
card‘ He lobbed 20 Tomahawk cruise
missiles into Baghdad over a non—
existent threat against Bush (killing
Iraqi ciViIians, every one of whom
had families and friends and was as
precious as our own parents, sisters,
brothers, lovers), Clinton sold out
Lani Guinier. the United Nations,
the environmental movement. Af—
rican Americans, gay and lesbian
rights.

He has agreed to the 7—year bal—
anced budget, agreed to massive
Medicaid cuts, come what may for
the poor, and is courting a welfare
proposal which his own Department
of Health and Human Services says
will throw another 1.2 million kids
into poverty. Now, in his “State of
the Union" address, he talks about
“one strike and you’re out" and pro—
claims that "the era of big govemt
ment is over. " As TheNati‘on point—
ed out, ”Like Reagan, this President
failed to mention cities, unions. or
race problems."

Bestchoice among the options?
Well, he is the most mendacious
choice. His rhetoric is less hateful,
and he looks nicer than any of the
Republican candidates. But I doubt
that through a global lens he would
look preferable to the other iingois-

tic plutocrats. And, in the end. I
must live inside my own
body and with my
own conscience. I
choose to dedicate
my entire life to a
peaceful to»
uottow.And
see voting in
n a t i o n a 1
elections as
the antithe»
sis of every-
thing I want
my life to
stand for.
