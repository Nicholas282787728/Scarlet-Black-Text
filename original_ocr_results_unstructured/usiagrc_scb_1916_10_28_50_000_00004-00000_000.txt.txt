made is eminently suited for the lead—
ing role in this opc- Added
to her wonderful voeal gifts she has
histrionio ahil s tar above the ma-
jority of operatic artiste Mme. Dal-
mada is also physically sur ed tor the
role. She is considered to he one of
the most beautiful women on the ups
eratie stage of the present day. Al-
though still young, her experience has
been very large and varied. The great
range of her voice has enahled her to
appear in a numher of different parts,
and with ease she can sing either
h‘aguer's “Brllunhlldc,” or the lighter
roles of the ltalian school. But Mme
Dalmatia is essentially an e.’ onent oi

The wonderful ease with which this
singer ean surmount vocal difficulties
may he judged from her delighttul

mgiug of “Bi-ulmlllldc” in the “le-
l( 'e," and m a different style of on~
crdiher perfect rendering of the in-
tensely drtficult music of “Aida." Ale
though the roles in which she has zips
pcarcd are many, and numher amongst
them prohahly the most difficult and
trying of all soprano parts, namely,
“Isolrlrt” in Wagner’s “Tristan and Is-
olda,“ there i- no sign of wear in this
wonder-till voreo. It is an organ full of
volume, r‘ hness of color. and one that
can por ay to the audience every ex-
pr sion and passion of human na-
turo.

Mme. Dalmatia, who comes to thi
country with the highest credentials
from Europe. is wonder-lolly enthus-
iastic 0v ~ the voices of American
singers. She eo ' ers that they have
among their ranlts omc ot the world's
greatest voices, and, moreover adds.
that America pos ~csscs teachers of the
art oi singing who cannot hc nnproved
upon in any country, and equalled in
few. Mme. Dalmada, although she can,
and has sung the operas in various
languages, has strong opinions on pre-
scnting opera in English. She is a
firm helicy r that opera should he

which it is heing heard, that it is im—
iar to sing an opera in a language
which is only understood hy a very
small pcrcentage of the audience.
