When news came out that ri possibly of
fensive party had taken place, rather than att
tempting to hear both sides of the story, and
indeed without hearing almost any of the
facts, phrases like "aggressive hurtsmachines,"
“everyone judge the shit out of these kids,”
“why does Grinnell even have a football
team?," and “you're a coward," have been used
in the public domain. Strong terms like “Mir
sogynistic," “harescrime,” and “bias motivited
incident,” are everywhere. For a campus that
prides itselfon being socially just, the response
to persecute these individuals was nearly in—
stantaneous, in many eyes, the football team
has clearly become a bastion of misogynists,
rapists, and privilege; everyone on the team is
seen as guilty and irredeemable. Small wonder
that the divide between football players and
the campus at large is so wide; blind distrust
and hatred tends to do that.

Some might ask, why after their year(s) at
Grinnell, do football players not undersrand>
The simple fact is that most people at Grinnell
are holding athletes to a societal conception
that they have not ascribed to, let alone been
invrted to be a part of. The atmosphere is ripe
to integrate athletes into Grinnell as a whole,
but the deep—rooted prciudite that greets
athletes on campus is an almost insurmountt
able obstacle for doing so. The Cunnilingus
party is absolutely indefensible, but it seems
that the campus has decided to ﬁght hatred
with hatred. Scapegoating and ostracizing
an already marginalized group on campus, a
group made up of great people, goes ayunst
every value that Grinneilians claim to hold
dear. What 1 find most problematic is that
no one is attempting to understand the differ»
ent cultures surrounding football players and
why this made them think such a party was
okay, and have instead turned to alienating,
marginalizing, and potentially expelling them.
Rather than turn to hate,I encourage everyone
to learn from this horrible event and work to
create a truly diverse community at Grinnell.

A greater problem

Our college is a mission~driven institu»
tion. It is one gniided by core values and foun-
dational principles that have been fought for,
and upheld, and institutionalized. As a com—
munity and as individuals, we strive to tips
hold these values in our interactions and our
relationshipsiand as a small residential colt
lege these interactions are all the more im»
portant because we see one another every day.
We live among one another, and depend on
each other for our stated community values
to be upheld. one ofthe college's core values
demands:

1. Personal, egalitarian and respectful int
teractions among all members of the college
community.

After events of last weekend, and after
many signiﬁcant events from this year, these
values appear to be under artack from men-it
bers of our community that are all affiliated
with the same athletic team. The football
team, spccifically, has among its members
the people most responsible for countless op-
pressive actions on campus over the past year.
Not all members of the football team are ten
sponsible, and many share our disgust at the
actions of their peers. There are also many
members of the team who have no power to
stop other members from acting in such an
untoward manner. I have seen many exam—
ples ofmembers ofthe team stand up against
acts of hate and sexism, but ir is my belief
that now greater, institutional action must be
taken against the entirety ofthe team, even if
the entire team is not responsible.

There is no doubt that several members
of the football team share responsibility to
for many despicable and inherently ﬂnll’

egalitarian behaviors This most or Manned
immediately before an even more severe evcnr
makes the issue unavoidable. I have witnessed
maddening displays of chauvinism, sexism,
homophobia, threats of sexual assault, and
misogyny throughout the year from members
of the football team, and these speciﬁc per
petrators never seem to get the message that
their behavior is unacceptable. Ifwe attended
an institution with a Greek system, and these
actions had happened in a fraternity. the
Chapter would be disbanded immediately.
Similarly, if the college funded a random
student group with tens ofthousands ofdol-
lars, and that hypothetical student group so
stepped over the line, the college would not
continue support the group with such genert
ous funding. The institution would feel gm,
barrassed to be affiliated with that organiza
tion. I cannot imagine any other organization
on campus that could so blatantly trample on
the core Wilues of our college while keeping
its funding secure. The football team should
be afforded no more special treatment.

I am not asking that the football team be
eliminated. I am, however, asking thar the
college not lie in bed so comfortably with a
group that creates a hostile and offensive en-
vironment on campus. Furthermore, I am not
laying out a plan for disciplinary actionil
believe that others are better suited to can.
strucr a proper response to deal with the cur
rent situation. I have no plan here to fight
broad issues of male privilege and misogyny
that permde student culture here on campus.
All I ask is that the Administration reevalu-
ate its monetary commitment to a team that
appears wildly out of line with its mission
statement.

In order to realign the College with its
mission statement, I propose that action must
be taken against the football team as a whole,
regardless of size of the group responsible. I
propose that the Administration make Signlf’
icant cuts in the budget of the football team.
I propose that SGA aggressively petition the
Administration to make these cuts immet
diately, and for the cuts to be signiﬁcant. If
our stated values relate to “egalitarian" and
“respectful interactions among all members
of the college community," funneling money
to this student group is unconscionable and
antithetical to the values that make us who
we are.

We exist as an institution committed to
making people feel safe while they learn.
Generously funding a program whose mem-
bers routinely make other members of the
community feel unsafe flies in the face of
what we love most about Grinnell College.
lfvve continue to fully fund the football team
next year we are all complicit in condoning
rhc actions of a student group known for
perpetraring acts of explicit and implicit vio-
lence, and threats ofviolence, against vulner—
able members of our community

Bias does not fix bias

The events of this pasr weekend were, ro
say tlic least, quite disturbing. They became
so our of control to the point that extremely
disparaging and demeaning things were Wnk
ten about individuals ofthe Grinnell College
community. I in no way condone or support
those actions They have hurt so many peo-
ple in .i way that can never be undone. I am
concerned, hoivcvcr, that groups and orgini~
zations are being incriminated wlitic ll‘lfll’
viduals, acting in their own right, committed
these iicts.This ensuing assignment ofblame
is very troubling.

Unfortunately, hurtful and generalizing
starcmenrs aimed at such groups as Grinnell
College male athletes as well as, more spe~
ciﬁcally, the Grinnell College Football Team
have been expressed profusely. If every them

her of either of rhcsc two groups organized,
participated, and/or was aware of the extent
of the vulgarity and hurtful nature of what
was wrirten, I would not object to these broad
statements, but this is just not true. Should
we convict an entire group for the actions of
a few?

This incident is gencrally being termed
as a biastmotivated incident, a classification
1 could not agree with more. But should we
meet bias with more bias? Should we meet
ignorance with more ignorance? By pigeon-
holing an entire organization or group that
some of those individuals happen to belong
to, are we are doing any better than they did?
Is that not how hurtful stereotypes and gent
eralizations start, when the actions of few are
generalized to many Should we not hold
ourselves to higher standards than them by
striving to be more thoughtful and Conscious?

Regulate dining hall waste

Some Questions: Why is rhcre so much
waste in the dining hall> Do we really want
to be gen ating so much gourmet hog slop?
Are we 1' ng according to our admissionsa
team pamphlet, booksstoresswag endorsed
values?

Now, while it's eternally in vogue for
college students to rail againsr ‘the (prefer
ably suited) man,’I think it's time that we
focus our classicallyshoned, critical eyes on
ourselves. Putting food on d’hall trays that
we won’t (potentially physically cannot) eat
cannot be earnestly blamed on the admin-
istration, the ‘system,’ rhe Matrix or even
MKVULTRA. That action stems from in-
dividual choices and we're all compli 't to
some degree. Now that the horse—pill has
been ingested, let us reenter the ‘what now?’
phase of our fractal thought process.

How can we improve our current practict
es? Primarily, we should promote an aware
ness campaign Within our own thoughts.
sounds weird, right? Yes it's weird, but let us
keep in mind the words of the sage: haters
goin hate, players goin playL verily, yo. Let’s
think about some basic, practical ideas for
our campaign: “Getting seconds takes but
seconds and therefore I don’t have to visut
ally recreate Thanksgiving each time I enter
Dick Williams turf before I take my seat."
Sounds reasonable, eh? How about: “It‘s not
economically advisable to reinforce thought-
less, wasteful practices because this only in
creases the final cost for me/otherpeople/
everyone...this argument is also known as...
prices affect prices affect prices.” Doesn't
this seem pragmatic, reasonable? Seriously
though,l want a rcsponse,l don’t know.

As an appeal to individual responsibils
ity, I realize that this argument will, with
youthful celerity, ricochet from the ear folds
of most readers. I further realize, gentle
reader, that certain selfish, slothful souls will
retort “mind your own beeswax" or “get a
job.” To that i say “fair enough" and “please
send me your address so that 1 may forward
you my resume, I hope you, sir, will find
it most agreeable." Even so, keep in mind
that I am not demanding that you instinrly
become ri saint, leave this (l‘ilPl'ilCCY behind
and ioin a commune inconvcnicntly distant
fiom ii decent cup of coffee. I am merely
asking that you yourself actively question
your own practices in order to live a more
responsible life. In the word of Thomas J.
Watson, “THINK." Does current gluttony
yield a greater benefit or cosr ro your intess
tinal tract, your mind, your pocketbook, your
peer student workers, your administrators
overhead costs, your college, your Grinnell
or your world? I think we can do bettei by
each of us striving ro become more aware
ofthe total repercussions of our choices and

thereby realizing greater responsibility.

That said, don't beat yonrsclfup about it.
Perfection is a direction, not a destination]
wish not to condemn any person and realize
that we all make misrakes, we are all imper-

Hoofin’ It notjust for RKO
Dear SUB,

When 1 read your article last week
about “Selah to celebrate Grinnell Com—
muniry,"I must admit my contentment to
see the caption of “Party boasts funding
raising red short run,” As an organizer of
the Hooﬁn’ It 5K event, I was elated to read
about the coverage of the event along side
with Selah. However, my enthusiasm stead-
fastly flagged as the perusal of the entire
article informed me about “a SK Red Short
Run fundraiser, named for Osgood’s infar
mous jogging attire," Although I clearly
recognized that the article focused primar-
ily on Selah, the complete abridgement and
recognition of Mortar Board’s efforts for
Hoofin' it 5K, ifi may opine, was definis
tively disappointing.

As part of the national college senior
honor society, the Grinnell College Chap-
ter seeks to encourage social justice and
community service for Grinnell commu~
nity, This year marked the 5th annual res
currence of the Mortar Board's Hoofin’ It
5K. The goals of the HooﬁnY It 5K rac are
1) to consciously fight poverty by ra ng
money for Midslowa Community Action
Group (MICA), which provides locally
fresh produce to poor families and Heifer
International, which donates sustainable
gifts of livestock to the poor in 115 count
tries around the world, 2) to encourage
health and fitness in the Grinnell commu-
nity, and 3) this year, we collaborated with
College and Alumni Relation for the Red
Short Run.

Admittedly, the Hooﬁn‘ It SK commit-
tee is very thankful for the opportunity
to collaborate with College and Alumni
Relation to incorporate the honoring as—
pect of our current president, Russell K.
Osgood. Their assistance of placing our
registration form on the Selah website
and providing the red shorts for the event
was greatly appreciated. However, 1 would
like to clarify that the extenswe planning
and efforts reposed solely on the 30 More
tar Board volunteers that orchestrated the
Hoofin’ lt 5i< event. Ranging from the
logistical aspects of composing an elabo-
rate contractual proposal. seeking City and
County's Approvals, obtaining insurance
for the participants, to the multifaceted
labors of informing every family along the
route, investing over $2100 in awards, food
and ttshirts, this 31nonth undertaking was
utterly disparaged in the simple “5K Red
Short Run fundra . er." Neither the Mortar
Board nor the Hooﬁn’ It Committee was
even cursorily mentioned.

At the risk of sounding like a finicky
curmudgeon. I must still assert my cha-
griu at the negligent curtailment of the
event. 1 apologize for thc callous runson
monologue (which must surely comprise of
seveinl dangling modifiers given my cur
rent sleep-deprivation), but I seek only to
forcfend the assiduity and the dedication
of many volunteers for this poverty issues
charity cvcnr.

Love and kirrens,
