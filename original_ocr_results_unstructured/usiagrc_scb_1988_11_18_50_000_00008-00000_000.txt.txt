Calling police hurts
trust among students

The college has always been more or less an independent
entity. The enforcement of laws is often more relaxed or even
ignored once a student crosses em or Park.

In recent years, police have not arrested any students on
campus. Two weeks ago this changed.

Two students were arrested on the third floor of Haincs
Hall for possession of marijuana. The Scarlet and Black does
not dispute that there was an illegal drug involved. However.
for the police to have been called in as a ﬁrst resort was
unfortunate.

Grinnell offers a student in the position of the caller ﬁve
ways to express dissatisfaction with an individual or
individuals smoking marijuana. First, a student can confront
the offenders in person. Second, if the student does not want
to do this, s/hc can talk to a student staff member, such as an
SA or HAC. Third, an RA can be asked to intervene. The
fourth option is to directly contact Dean of Student Affairs
Tom Crady, or any of the Student Affairs staff. The ﬁfth
option is to call the police.

Calling the police is the most extreme option a student
can take. The call two weeks ago traumatized Haincs 3rd and
damaged student tnrst.

We live in close quarters at Grinnell Harmonious
campus life requires a sense of trust. Students often leave
their doors unlocked and leave notes and books in the library.
Harmonious campus life also requires communication
between students. By calling the police, the options which
allow for communication are not given a chance.

In the future, let's deal with our own problems, or at
least make an attempt, before taking a step with major, lasting
repercusstons.

A Hand Among the Leaves

Describe the life cycle of
your bestrsmelling deodorant. Is
it Ban? Sure? Mcnnen? Or your
favorite shampoo. Is it Agree?
Port? Johnson and Johnson? If
your essential pastes, powders,
liquids and solids were made by
one of the large toileLry or cos-
metic industrial complexes (like
Gillette. Proctor and Gamble,

Todd Francis
& Veronica Budz

Maybelline, Bristol-Myers, Col-
gale-Palmolive and others),
chances are the product went from
the research and development di-
vision to the animal testing divi-
sion of the corporation before it
ever got to your house.

There, the deodorant or
shampoo (or soap or eye shadow
or lipstick) was tested on animals
such as cats, dogs, rabbits,
guinea pigs or rats to find out its
toxicity. At concentrated levels,
the product likely underwent the
Draizc Test, a Lrial of the chemi-
cal that involves dripping it into
the animals' eyes. which are often
clamped open. This test is espe,
cially effective in rabbits, because
these animals cannot produce
tears to wash the substance away.

In a typical example of the
Draize Test, according to PETA
magazine (People for the Ethical
Trcau'nent of Animals), unanes-
lhelicized rabbits had a new CXv
pcrimcntal hair spray applied to
their eyes. The consequences
were redness and a puss—like ooz-
ing from the eyes, One rabbit‘s
eyes became dull and hazy,
showing swelling with the lids

Applications of test product to this rabbit's skin left

only muscles and bones.

about half closed. The test often
leads to immediate or eventual
blindness in the test animals.

Other tests for cosmetics
and toiletries include skin applir
cations, forced ingestion, and of-
ten determination of the LDSO »-
what concentration of the product
in question will kill one—half of
the research subjects? Not only
are the already mentioned prod
ucts tested using these methods,
the research often extends to floor
polishes, weedkillers, detergenm,
and industrial chemicals.

Two questions must be
asked about these animal experi—
ments: Are the products involved
in animal testing, like cosmetics,
exotic hair care products, and
even dcodorztnls, ever needed at

all? And, what kinds of alt/ema-
tive producLs exist that do not re-
quire animal suffering to insure
their safely'.l

A list of companies that
never use animal experimentation
is available from the Humane
Society of the United States or
from PETA. The list includes
companies such as St. Ives and
Kiss My Face. Many products
whose production involves no
animal testing can be bought
through the Grinnell Buying
Club, a member of Blooming
Prairie Food Cooperative in Iowa
City. Further information on
animal experiments, both for
product testing and for scientiﬁc
research, is discussed in Peter
Singer's Animal Liberation.

Against the Grain

"Miscellaneous Ramblings"

Well hey guys, there are a
couple of Lhings I need to write
about this week. Forgive me,
but I am going to have to do a
little topic jumping. First things
first, there have been several
readers who have expressed con-
cern to me over my paragraph
about the grape boycott that ap
peared two weeks ago in the

Mike Kent

Scarlet and Black. To resolve all
misunderstandings, allow me to
tell you what School policy is
regarding student boycotts.

The cafeteria is obligated to
provide an alternative food choice
on the days when the boycotted
item is to be served. How much
depends on what percent of the
student body voted to approve the
boycott. In the case of the
grapes, seventy percent of the
students will be provided with an
alternative food choice. Thirty
percent of the students will still

have grapes available to them.
After the initial distribution of
these food items. purchases of
boycotted and alternative food
items will be based strictly on
consumption levels. What this
writer suspects, since only a little
more than a third of the student
body voted, is Lhat actual con-
sumption levels will be much.
much higher than the original
seventy/thirty spliL

Another thing I need to talk
about is the political afﬁliation
of this column. It has none.
Although most of the arguments
so far this year have been conser-
vative, not all of them will be.
To reinforce the independence of
this column, next week I will
jump to the other side of the po-
litical spectrum and give you my
spiel for the legalization of drugs,
in light ofthe recent drug bust on
campus. This will no doubt
alienate my only support group,
the conservatives. Oh well.
Let’s hear it- for principles.

Hey guys, looks like
George Bush is president. Large
charge. If you want to know the
truth, I voted Libertarian this
year. I don‘t even remember the
guy's name, but I do know it
wasn't Bush or Dukakis. Actu-
ally, I am really glad Bush won.
Of course, I wouldn't have
minded if Dukakis had won. The
way I ﬁgure, the country is gee
ting screwed one way or the
other. The beauty of LIIIS elec-
tion is that no matter which one
of the major candidates won,
nothing would get any better.
This may sound rather cynical,
but let me explain why this is
good. I am a futurist, indepen-
dent, progressive. N progres-
sive by the same def lion used
by the PSN but progressive in
the sense of the trustbuster era
Californians. I would like to see
a government with no political

parties, and strict control over

lobbies. I would like to see can-
