 

Census Taking Popu-
lar with the Society
“New-Boys.”

Census-taking is apparently becom-
ing quite the voge among the newly
initiated literary society members.
That it is becoming popular is evidenc-
ed by the fact that irate farmers are
being awakened at all nocturnal hours
by timid, inquisitive persons who are
compiling statistics on the number of
livestock possessed by the farmers of
Poweshiek county.

According to data thus far accumu-
lated there are approximately 437
cows owned by farmers, 63 chickens.
(which according to late reports has
dwindled to 17 because of a hunch oi
local poultry thieves starting opera-
tions), 715 head of cattle which have
been maimed by college boys out hunt-
ing rabbits, and 7 hogs. No horses,
mules or cats have been enumerated
us yet. These figures represent only
those farms within a radius of four,
miles of Grinnell. The complete cen-
sus, however, is expected to swell
these totals but little. ,

These feats or newly initiated mem-
bers however are not the most pains-
taking. It is‘ rumored that one fu—
ture surveyor traveled to Newburg to
make a plat of that residential city.
Caretakers at local cemeteries have
reported seeing spirits hovering round
graves lately. This may he explain-
ed by those who are hunting an X-
'neaded grave. Railroad agents have
been maetrially assisted in their work
by men interested in the volume of
local freight and have dispensed with
part of the freight agents’ work by
countingrhox cars. Taking it all in
all it expected that many an initiative
will have added materially to his store
all it expected that an initiate
season is over. ‘

Activities versus grades! On with

the argument. A great deal can be
said for both grades and activities,

Colleges Overcrowded
Says Famous Author

“Too many men and women are
going to college and their number
drags down the tone and standards
of the college," said Percy rial-ks,
authnr of the much discussed novel
on college life, “The Plastic Age,” in
an address at Columbia, Missouri, be—
iorc ogroup of University Students
Monday.

College is for the intellectual aris—
tocmcy, Marks declared, and the
”mad scramble for new students by
alumni and college presidents is to
be regretted. My views may not be
democratic, but if they are not, then
neither was the Creator, for all men
are not created eoua

The author declared that “cowcola
logos" are not partl or education. Ed-
ucation is to teach one about himself
and how to live, and the agricultural
college does not do that, he said. Too
many unnecessary things have been
accumulated by colleges todly.

"The Liberal college should be the
heart of every university," he said.
“You are here for one purpose only

about life. By the time you have
gone through a Liberal Arts college

"A sign that college is largely a

terribly bored. They are afflicted

'I‘ll'll EXTRA LOAD.

(The loliowing editorial, written by Allen Ashby, of East High,
Des Moines, won the cup which is offered each year by the Grinnell

chapter of sigma. DeltaClll.)

I once heard a coal ileztlel' talking to one of his employees.
What I could gather, the employee had met Willi serious reverses :ulll
had gone deeply in debt to his employer, and they were discussing the

quickest method of paying this debt.

said the dealer, “will pay all your oxppnses, but cnch load you get over
those two is the one which will put you on your ieet, so to speak
other words, it is that extra loztd or two which will in the end get you

square with the world.”

I thought this advice over, and decided that we could use it right

I'm too young to die that way.

Here is where the lesson of the coalman comes in: Every bit

The rcoihell player, the dehcter, the
