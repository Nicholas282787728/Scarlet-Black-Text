Grinnell Artifacts Displayed at Museum

by Susan Roth

The Grinnell Historical Museum
is not a nationally recognized land
mark. Most of the time it is barely
noticed by those passing by on
Broad Street (next door to Band
Aid Housel. Inside. however, the
museum houses both a varied col-
lection oi artifacts donated by the
community over the years tine
eluding J.B, Grinnell's
“executive” desk, on loan from the
college) and a weltpresented ex-
ample oi the interior at a Grinnell
home around the turn of the cenr
tury. The museum began in the
early 19505, growing out oi a collec-
tion of artifacts about early Grin-
nell that was entered in a
communityrbetterment contest.
The collection didn't win the can-
test, said collector and volunteer
host Elizabeth Ernst. but the two
book groups and DAR groups who
had begun the project kept collec-
ting and began working towards an
actual museum.

The first Grinnell Historical
Museum was located in a set 0i
rentri'ree 'rooms above Cunne
ingham's Drugstore from 195! unr
til 1954, when a lire destroyed the
upstairs rooms and most at the ar-
tiiacts. Subsequently, according to
iorrner curator Rose Stoops, the
curators met “and they decided
they would continue with the
museum project. And so they con-
tinued to collect Items out of the
past ior display and they continued
to have money-raising projects
such as rummage salesand book
sales." They also began a search
tor a permanent home tor the
museum, A former Grinnellian 0i-
fei'ed her grandfather's home, but
it was not used because, said
Stoops, it had too little room [or

An editorial opposed the imr
plementation oi a core curriculum
(12 CrediB in each of the three divi-
sions) ior the/(allowing reasons.
First, according to the editorial,
with the way the departments were
divided. the question of diversity
was irrelevant, because
“Sociology does not belong in the
same division as philosophy or
Religious Studies" and “placing
math in the science division has
always amazed certain purists."

display. ultimately, the house at
i125 Broad Street became
available and was purchased in
1964 with the insurance oi the iirst
museum and with money solicited
through a iinancial drive. This par-
ticular house, built in 1395 by a pro
minent local businessman, was
known as “one or the iine new
homes," with itssgold oak wood»
work, beveled French glass wine
dows, and three stained-glass
panels in each oi the big windows.
The house was also built with cen-
tral heating, electric lights, and a
bathroom, all oi which are still in»
tact.

As ior the artifacm, Ernst said.

“Everything that's in the house
either belonged to people in Grin
nell or in the county" and are, ior
the most part, donated. Although
the only real requirement ior ace
ceptance into the museum is that
the items Originally belonged to
people in Grinnell or in Poweshiek
County, Stoops admitted that some
items have had to be turned down
because “it got to the point that
people were bringing in
everything,"

In addition to the artifacts on
display, the museum also keeps an
archive of documents that include
old photographs, scrapbooks,
newspaper clippings, diaries. and

Second, many oi the lower-level
couises did not provide a mean-
ingiul introduction to the
discipline, and those courses could
be “duplicated by reading the ap-
propriate section at Time
magazine." The editorial concludr
ed that because at the way Grin-
nell's departments were divided, a
core-curriculum proposal would
give no guarantee oi diversity, and
“even it the departments were
grouped in a more logical manner,
the prisence of watered-down,
lowerrlevel Courses would cripple
the plan’s objective," in addition,
the editorial pointed out that,

because many oi Grinnell's then-
curl‘ent Students had chosen the
college because oi is lack or re
quirements, it was pretty sale to
assume that iuture students would
do it ior the same reason, and ac
cording to Dean oi Student Aiiairs
Jim Tederman, “The college
wouldn't want to discourage
qualitied candidates. would it
now?”

A letter to the editor responded
to an article printed two weeks
earlier about the demise oi the
Republican Party by declaring
that “Reagan is not dangerous to
the Republican Party" because

One tile in particular that is used
with some irequency is the collec-
tion oi 25,000 obituaries. Because
there is no copy machine at the
museum, patrons are allowed to
take out the obituaries to copy at
the town library, and, said Ernst,
“We've never lost one yet."
Although the college community
has not really made use oi the
museum resources because its own
archives are well-stocked. Stoops
points out that the museum

How many black proiessors or
teachers have you had?

Most oi us graduated irorn high
school and will graduate irorn
Grinnell without incorporating ex-
cluded perspectives and
knowledge into our manipulated
and limited education, in Kesho
Scott's class we are reexamining
the American liie by moving black
women irorn the margin to the
center oi our iocus. By doing this
we are not only learning tradi»
tionally ignored tacts about black
women, but we are also realizing
how we have internalized society’s
messages, For example, why does
black always represent evil, white
white represents good". why is our
standard oi beauty based on
Caucasian characteristics?

because oi the knowledge that
we have gained, we understand
how society's stereotypes deter-
mine how we deal with ourselves
and others on a daily basis. Do you
realize how eiiective a mammy on
a syrup bottle is in oppressing all
black women" Are you aware oi
the triple oppression iii a black les-
hian? Do you realize how these
pervasive stereotypes aiiect your
interactions with other Grin
nellians?

these questions and how they ops

The class is using the computer
o give the poll in order to make it
easier for students and faculty to
aka the poll and easier tor the
