No one on your siaK or in airy lerrers comes tics: ro marching
rhe nice balance of eloquence and economy found in Brian Turner's
Lerrer ro rhe Editor orrhe larr Deeember issue ofrhe 563. As
always, Mr. Turner offers profound informarion and insighrs in
prose rlrar manages moderry, passion, and elear readabiliry
Alrhouglr he has already gradunred. ir would be foolish for rhe 5&3
nor ro oirer him a spor ro sound ofra couple runes a monrh. i
would ccrrainly ar lemr read his arricles orilrne, whereas nrosr ofrhe
resr ofrhe newspaper is iusr like ir always has been: bland and
whiney. I rhink you do a good yob, bur l rhink rhar srudenrs
probably pur rheir besrwriring inro rherr srudies, which leaves rhe
mpm newspaper wirh some scrappy lefrovers rhar aerually can be
annoying ro read. The borrom line you haveagrear resource righr
in from of your nose. Mr Turner could well be employed by far
finer media rhar reaeh readers on rhe seale ofhundreds of rimes rhe
5&3 readership. lfyou don'r publish him, l can only encourage
undergraduares ro seek our Brian and ralk ro him. lusr ler him ralk
