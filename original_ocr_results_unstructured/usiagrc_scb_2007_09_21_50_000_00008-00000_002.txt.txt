It‘s two miles from Indianola High School to the
town’s balloon ﬁeld. I admit that I would never have
known this—or even carediif I had not walked that
distance twice last Sunday.

I pulled my car into the high school parking lot, the
designated meeting place for Hillary Clinton’s registered
supporters to pick up their entry tickets for the Harkin
Steak Fry, the group 1 was shadowing. One by one, those
around me stared grimly at the barely moving line ofcars
jammed along Highway 92. I had to agree with them.

The trudge along the dusty, gravel—strewn highway
shoulder gave me ample time to examine the Iowa farm-
land around me. Political signs seemed to grow out otrhe
ﬁelds like a strange crop ofred, white and blue patterned
fruit advertising each ofthc six candidates scheduled to
speak. A sign sprung up every toot or so, leading pedese
trian Steak Fry goers, like Hansel and Gretel, towards
our destination.

As I rounded the corner, I could make out banners,
tents and satellite news vans spotting the area just be-
yond the line ofcars. People shouting and waving signs
swarmed everywhere like a hive ofzealous hoesA reeling
ofcxcitement enveloped the place, and it was hard not to
become caught up in the fervor.

Icntci-cd the gates and immediately a woman thrust
a John Edwards campaign newspaper into my hands.
People covered in political buttons and stickers milled
around the cntrance’s chaos. To the right rose up the
white tents that housed both the event's famous steaks
and long rows ofpicnic tablesfl‘o the left people leisurely

greet voters.

Until then, the candidates and their spouses were only
known to me through TV sound bites and newspaper
articles, Here they appeared as ﬂesh and blood.

delivering an unexpectedly rousing speech, He shouted
his appeals for a change in the government. echoing the
Democratic war cry that everything Bush had to go. As
his oratory went on, the crowd’s applause rang about me
in a roar,

Harkin acted as a sort of master of ceremonies,
introducing each candi»

podium.
