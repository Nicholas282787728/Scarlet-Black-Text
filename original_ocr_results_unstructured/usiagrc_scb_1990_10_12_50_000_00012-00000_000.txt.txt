Men's Soccer Team Avenges
Illinois College Tie, Beats Coe

By Doug Hodum

A tie against Illinois College is
the only blemish on the men's soc-
cer team record so far this season.
Recently, Grinnell Lravelled to Illir
nets to avenge that tie.

After beginning the game in a
pumpedeup manner, both teams
settled down and had opportunities
to score. However, it was Grinnell
that capitalized on scoring oppore
ttinities first. Steve Fairchild slid
the ball past the goalieafter receiv-
ing a feed from the midﬁeld. Grin-
nelldominated the remainderofthe
firsthalf as Illinois seemed to lose
some of its patience.

The second half. however.
proved to be quite a struggle for
Grinneli, Illinois seemed to wake
upandplayed verywell. Grinnell‘s
defense managed to thwart its up
poncnts. with about 15 minutes
left in the game. Ian Lorimer drove
a direct kick around a wall and off
an Illinois player, past the goalie.
From then on, Grinneli played well
enough to defeatIllinois. its nearest
competition for the division lead.

Tuesday, the team travelled to
Coe. At the outset of the game.
Grinneli looked flatand uninspirtxl.
and Coe had some attempts early
on.

Grinnell managed to turn things
around. however, and put more
pressure on the Coe defense. Fi-
nally, sieve Fairchild tallied a goal
and put the team up 1-0. In the
sacond half, Peter Greif scored,
seemingly ending Coc‘s chances.
However, after the Coe goalie was
injured, Coe came out and began
pressuring the Grinneli net. After
missing some opportunities, Coe
scored two goals to tie it up. Regu-
lation time ended in a Lie.

Grinneli took the field for over
time with goalie Howard Gardos
sufferingfromwhatwouldbediag-
nosed later as a mild concusston.

Fairchild completed Ille scoring
in the second overtime period. Coe
pressed for the remainder of the
game, but the defense did not give
its opponent any second chances.

Saturday,Grinnellgoes to Knox
forits final conference game before
the conference championships.

cluding seven shutouts in lZgaincs.

Saturday, the women traveled to
Missouri toplay a veryslrong team
from Westminster. The match was
extremely competitive, but thePio-
neers were able to pull out a 2.1
victory. All the scoring occurred in
the ﬁrsthalfbeginningwithaquick
Westminster goal. Grinneli, how-
ever, was able to counter when a
comer kick by Jen Wood deﬂected
off a Westminster player into the
goal. Late in the half, Grinneli
