National Coming Out W
DYEWitness marketers defend product

Day: Carpe diem

Have you ever used the word [aggmﬂ Have you ever turned your head
in disgust at tlte sight of two women kissing? Have you ever been afraid to
where apink triangle ora "Don‘tpresumel'm straight " pinbecause someone
might really think your gay/lesbian/bi?

Then National Coming Out Day is an excellent opportunity for you to
learn more about tlte difﬁculties and fears which gay/lesbian/biscxual
people are forced to face each day in a predominantly heterosexual world.
And while Grinnell College prides itself on being an open-minded environ»
ment, Shelly West's column re-
minds us that homophobia still ex-
ists in the campus community.
Perhaps it lingers in all of us,gay or
straight.

National Coming Out Day is a
time for heterosexuals to examine
their attitudes toward homosexuality and to createasafe, supportiveenviron-
ment for all Grinnell Queers.

This is a day for homosexuals to experience a supportive environment.

This is also the time for the silent supponers of the homosexual commu-
nity to voice their support: whether one wears an arm band, attends the story
hour or even stops to read a National Coming Out Day poster. one is
acknowledging the existence of a non-heterosexual world. Each of these
actions represents an attempt to facilitate a more open-minded environment
not only for those who want to come out of the closet but for those who have
not been educated on homosexual issues.

Those who do not agree with a homosexual lifestyle must realize that they
are not obligated to experience it, yet they must accept it as a valid form of
sexual/emotional expression. Just as homosexuals are forced to allow
heterosexuals the space for expression. so must the straight community

allow the freedom to be openly homosexual.
National Coming Out Day should be a time when Grinnell students
should feel safe to come out of the closet. Carpe diem.

To the editor,

In the October 4th edition of the
Scarlet and Black, Jennifer Mattem
used her cartoon strip lgnoble Fur-
suitr to focus on DYEWitness. In her
humorous and poignant way, she has
brought up what we consider to be a
very serious issue regarding the use
of this product.

DYEWitness is a criminal identi»
tier which can aid an individual in
escaping from potentially violent situ-
ations. It is not a toy, nor is it to be
usedason Itcarries with it the same
responsib ty that comes with own-
ing any self-protection device, in»
cluding mace and ﬁrearms. Misuse
of the product is considered serious,
and anyone using the device for any-
thing other than self—defense may be
liableforanydamagethey maycause.

One of the features that makes
DYEWitness so unique is that it is
nonrtoxic, non»harrnful and can stain
an attacker‘s skin dark green for up to
seven days. The stain aids law en-
forcementofﬁcialsinidentifyingand
locating the criminal. However,
DYEWitness stains more than skin; it
stains most other things, including
many textiles, permanently. In other
words, ifyou think itmightbe funny
to turn your friend green for a week,
think again. More than likely, you
will ruin their clothes and most evv

erything they touch, and you will be
liable for the damage,

DYEWitness isdesigned lobe used
in emergency situations in which a
person feels physically threatened,
and it enables the intended victim to
break free from an attacker and seek
help. It is designed to aid in the iden-
tification, arrest and prosecution of
criminals who commit vtolent acts

such as assault and/or sexual assault.

It is notdesigned for anything else. If

you have any questions regarding

DYEWimess, please call us at 236-
3896.

To the editor,

This letter is in response to Jordan
Magill's column in the October 4th
edition of the Scarlet and Black. I
sharelordan’sbeliefthatitisimpera-
tive that Grinnell College remain a
need-blind institution and read wrth
concern that you believe that “finan
cial aid seems to be a principle [sic]
area that is cut back." This is not the
case.

In 1990-91, a total of 57.56 mil-
lion was awarded by the Financial
Aid Ofﬁce; of this, $6.18 million was
awarded in grants from Grinnell Col-
lege funds and $1.38 million in self
help. Since more students enrolled
this August titan we anticipated, we

decided to overspend the financial
aid budget. This Fall, 989 students
have been awarded financial atd.
According to Mr. Lincoln, the ﬁnan—
cial aid procedures are the same as
last year.

FRIENDLY FIRE
America's favorite pastimes

This past week, two icons of my
youth carneback into my life in ways
which Icould never have anticipated.
Baseball cards and nuclear weapons.
and Iwas being asked to say goodbye
to both.

I suppose that if I were to describe
to one of those hypothetical green
creatures from outer space the major
elements which compose life in the
latter half of the 2011i century, I could
do it all by merely explaining base-
ball cards and nuclear weapons. We
can see all that is good and bad about
the society we live in. contained in
these two phenomena. 1) Weapons
which only the most creative and
imaginative minds could conceive,
built to impose desolation and de-
struction on a scale not to bebclieved
and controlled by leaderswhowanted
their enemies to drink they wercjust
crazy enough to use them. 2) Baseball
cards, pictures of grown men playing
a kid’s game for millions of dollars,
on cheap pieces of cardboard which
today are bought and sold by more
grown men (and sometimes women)
for up to tens of thousands of dollars.

Idon’t ihinkl am the only person,
who, as a kid, woke up in the dark,
frightened by a nightmare about
nuclear war. There was a fear which
was different from our parents' gen~
eration.

We were living in the era of R0-

Josh Ford

nald Reagan and his military budget,
which created the largest peace-time
militarybuild-upsinceRoosevelt. On
the television we were given repeated
reminders of the nuclear holocaust
which might or might not come, I
watched “The Day After" and was
scared; I wondered if I would live to
the age I am now. I saw movies like,
”The Road Warrior" and “Testa-
ment,” which depicted vcry differ-
ently the horrors of a post-atomic
world.

On a similar note, I don‘t tltink I
am the only person who collected
baseball cards as a kid. I would bring
them to school and trade them with
my friends. Play “flips" for keeps, a
game where you shuffled your cards
with a buddy, would toss the cards
one by one, each time the person with
the furthestthrowkeeping both cards.
I remember that‘s how I assembled
triple copies of Greg “Bull" Luzinski
and quadruple copies of Pete Rose in
a Phillies uniform. There were cards
you never ﬂipped with. For instance,
any Yankee player from the champi-
onship years of the late 70s. Craig
Nettles was my favorite-in little
league I practiced diving for ground
balls down the tltird base line.just so

the dirton my uniform would slighLly
resemble his. I was never the kid who
collected all the cards for one season,
but over time I built up a venerable
collection, much like the daunting
assemblage of nuclear arms by my
country.

I haven’t looked at my baseball
cards for years, and haven’t had a
dream about nuclear war in a while
either, but I was reminded of both
these past few weeks. First, there was
President Bush’s announcement of
major reductions in nuclear arms and
nuclear readiness. Of course, the
whole thing wasblown outofpropor-
tionby themedia.Wehaven'texactly
thrown the gun into the ocean, but we
have taken it away from our heads
and put the safety lock on.

Second was a message I received
from my brother, telling me he had
found our baseball cards and that af-
ter sifting through them found quite a
few to be rather valuable. l-Ie men-
tioned Roger Clemens and Ryne
Snndberg rookie cards. Contrary to
what George Bush has to say about it,
there is still a recession going on in
the country, at leastwhere I live. and
my brother thoughtthatby selling the
cards we could have a little more cash
onourhands than wenortnally would.
His idea made complete sense. I have
