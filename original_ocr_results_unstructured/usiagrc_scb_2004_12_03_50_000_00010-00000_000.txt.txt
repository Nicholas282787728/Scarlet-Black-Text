Understanding Ukraine’s democratic crisis

The past weeks have seen a crisis of democracy unfold
in the Ukraine. While perhaps not always known for good
governance as such, the Ukraine has long proudly borne the
badge of not being northern neighbor and postrcommunist
lapdog Belarus (whose colorful despot Alexander Lnkashenr
ka hopes some day to be a shoddy off-brand Vladimir
Putin.) However, on November 21st, a presidential .
election was held and rigged,and now it seems that

the Ukraine is at a quite important crossroads.

Neither the opposition candidate not the people of

the Ukraine seem willing to accepr the obviously

fraudulent result, and pressure is building for a

legitimate rerun of the election. Should the

movement succeed, the Ukraine will follow

its post-soviet playmate Georgia in tak- ‘

ing the extraordinaty step of enforcing

democratic principles by peaceful force

ofpopular will.

The Ukrainian election has been characterized by an East-
West schism in the Ukrainian polity and policy preferences
(although the considerable corruption of the incumbent rer
gime has played no small role as well.) Viktot Yanukovich, the
current prime minister, favorite candidate of outgoing presi-
denr Leonid Kuclima and purported president-elect, is the
candidate ofchoicc in Ukraine’s Russian speaking and indusr
trial east. Mr. Yanukovichs platform is broadly prorRussian,
and like his merry neighbor Mr. Lukashenka in Belarus, Mr.
Yanukovtch can he expected to cozy up closcly to Russ .Mr.
Putin has already congratulated Mr, Yanukovich on his '
tory," and discounted any notion of malfeasance.

The citizen’s of Ukraine’s west, meanwhile, tend to speak
Ukrainian and have a Westerly vision ofthe Ukraine’s future.
They mostly voted for opposition candidate Viktor Yushe
chenko, who advocates greater independence from Russia and
setting down the path to someday join the EU and NATO.
Accordingly,Mr.Yushchenko has found himselfthe subject of
sympathy from the US and EU.

The presidential runroffin question was held on Novemr

ber 21st, and exit polls suggested a decisive, it‘not overwhelm-
ing, victory for Mt. Yushchenko. Come November 24th, hOWr
ever, the central election commission announced a victory for
Mr. Yanukovich by about 3 percent of the popular vote. The
Yushchenko campaign, his supporters, and international
observers were understandably skeptical of the results,
and Mr. Yushchenko’s supporters took the streets in
force, with a peaceful protest in Kiev numbering in

the hundreds of thousands.
Otlicr institutions of Ukrainian governance have
since leap: into the mix, The Ukrainian parliament
declared the results invalid in a nonrbrnding referenr
dum, calling the results “at odds with the will of
the people." Shorrly thereafter, Mr. Yushchcn-
ko's party and its allies drove for a vote of
nOTCOnﬁdEnCe in the prime minister and
presidentrelect’s government, and sucr

ceeded by a hair, ,

Although there is no legal authority backing either ofrhc
paritamcnt's efforts on the matter, irs voice rttay have sortie
inﬂuence with the Ukrainian Supreme Court, which stopped
the ofticial declaration of the results, pending review of the
Yushchenko campaign's claim oi’vote t’raud. Both the \r’ttsh-
ehenko campaign and international observers claim that large
irregularities in absentee ballot counts in the prorgovernnient
East indicate large»scale multiple votin

The supremc court’s ruling is du ~hortly, and may evcn
be available by the time this column is published. Meanwhile,
after some bliisteting, Mr. Yushclienko has agreed to resume
talks with the government after the Supreme Court’s ruling,
apparently whatever that may be,

The untest and protests have been peaceful, as has the
government response. It’s hard to say how the conflict will
be resolved, but at least thus far, the Ukraine has coped well
with a fraud, and its people are demonstrating the will and
wherewithal to make rhcir own good governance. Whatever
happens with the Ukraine, its neighbors should hope for as
much.

Our thoughts on grief

In the past few years, on~campus disc sions about gricfhave
grown more public and more prolitic. Though we can’t claim ex-
perLise, we wish to contribute to dris dialogue. But first and force
most,we wish it known that our thoughts continue to be with
the family and friends ofThomas Alexander and Stephen Frey,
father of Aven Frey '05.We wish Aven and her mother strength
and courage in their rccoveryWe are all grieving, and in addition
we are all handling the stress brought on by school, winter and
holidays. It is within this context that we offer our words.

Fust,we commend Student Affairs, the Mental Health Cenr
tar and the Chaplains Ofﬁce for making the grief process better
understood and accepted on campus, and for working with stu-
dents trying to acknowledge and manage griefwhile juggling the
demands ofan intense academic and social environment.

Though not everyone in Grinnetl knew Thomas or knows
Aven and her family, none are immune to the sudden loss of a
community member. The sudden and unetpected death of even
a stranger can hurt, whether it revives dormant emotions and
memories or simply reminds us of how unpredictable and mm,
sient our world ‘~ Rationally, we know that death happewm
have religious, philosophical, poetic and scientiﬁc tools to aid eit—
planarion and rapresion offeeling—but often they seem insuf-
ﬁcient during the moments we need them most.

Associate Chaplain Deborah Brin aid in an interview last
spring, “Grief is as individual as individuals are.” It transforms
with varying circumstances. Juniors and seniors on our staidr re-
act diﬁ’erently to the death of a Grinnellian than do ﬁrst- and
seooiid- year students, as the fmmewotkwe use to oope with un-
expected and tragic events holds memories ofthe deaths ofthtee
students and a professor in spring 2003. Griefcan have profound
impact on one's outlook It can paralyze and inhibit subsequent
life management. And,let’s face it,wiclr every minute devoted to
academics, area-outrioilai-s or social life, grieving at GrinneLl can
seem impossible

The relief of winter break is a mere two weeks away...but
the last two weeks are not easy. Plus, it's cold outside. We are ap-
proaching die Wintn solstice: the hours of daylight grow fewer
as we stay up later into the night completing assignrnents.While
we might look forward to five weeks free from college life and
strcsscs,we also anticipate a month away from our friends.

For ﬂies: with moods unaiirected by shortened days and
elongated workloads, we encourage you to share your secrets. We
suggest that everyone ﬁnd creative ways to stay warm and relax,
such as holding a tea and soone study break with a few friends,
or atten ' the ﬁnals week cookie and milk breaks at Burling.
But don't stay indoors indeﬁnitely: bundle up and face the cold
with a dogged determin 'on to sweat as spite. Eating regularly
and healthfully and limiting caffeine intake will also help beat
the lethargy that seas in when it’s below freezing outside. And
please, please sleep. Allow yourself to grieve. Attend to your body
and emotions. Find ways to make winter arid academic stress
more manageable, and convince friends to do the same. And if
these suggestions seem impossible, don'tbe embarrassed to talk to
someone—especially someone trained to listen and give unbiased
advice.

Remembering close friend, beloved Grinnellian

I’m certain that by now, everyone is aware of the death of
Thomas Alexander ~ a good man, a great friend, the very epito'
me ofa Grinnellian. I write in response to his death.

My political idol, John Kerry said once in a speech that
“Every day is extra." Having never been on the field ofbattle ,
except battle waged with foam swords, of course r i never truly
understood the magnitude of that state-
ment until Sund . Thomas is tragic
proof of the fragility of our right to
existence, ofthe stunning and cruel fact
that nature can take that right from us
in the blink of an eye, without warning
or explanation.

He is proof that senseless death
transcends age, nationality or political
party affiliation. Just as death transcends those lines, it is my
hope thar grieffor him in this community will transcend rhose
lines, cncompasstng professors and students, jocks and hippies,
males and females.

It is appropriate that grief at his death shorrld be universal,
for Thomas’s love oflife and of his fellow humans was univer-
sal. Never once in the entire time I knew him - and he and 1

Letters to

the Editor\\

were acquainted for most ofour Grinnell careers, though l only
became close to him towards the end ofour sophomore year —
did i hear him speak a callous or cold word to llnyone. As is true
ofevcryone,Thotnas was closer to some people than to others,
but he treated everyone with respect and decency, tolerating
and sometimes even embracing those who were ostracized by
others.
For those who
didn’t know him, no
: words of mine can
paint a picture of his
character that would
be fitting. Though I
am a specchwritcr by
vocation, what wortls
of mine or anyone's could possibly describe
the exact quantity of the light that shot forth from Thomlts's
eyes every time you met his gaze, or the cunning fox’s grin he
wore as he charged onto the Dag field with his beloved spear or
traded banter with his dear friends over video games?
What words could adequately quantify the passion that
thrutnmed in his voice when he spoke about politics or the soft,

be fitting.

For those who didn’t
know [Thomas], no
words of mine can
paint a picture of his
character that would

almost reverent tones he used when speaking to or about his

beloved fiance Aven, which told beyond any doubt the depths

of the intimacy between them? What words could I use to der

scribe that set ofmannetisms » which would have earned sneer-

ing and mockery for many but which were so well-suited to

him e which he used to make everyone around him laugh on a
regular basis?

No words can do him justice, so this small
eulogy will have to serve as a poor substitute
for justice: a great man has fallen, a leader of
men, with a kind heart and a freight of good
dreams that are now tragically lost,jettisoned
rrrto the sea ofetcrnity. He was the very ex-
ample ofintegriry and self-actualization, and
everyone who knew him and everyone who
didn't has much to learn from his example.

Here’s to Thomas, for he fought the good fight, he finished
the course, he kept the faith.

Yours most sincerely and respectfully,

—Jt7hn Bennett Abramowr'tz ’05
