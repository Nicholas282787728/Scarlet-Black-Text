Imagination is a multimedia
space fantasy, an escape into the
world of images and dreams through
the use of sound, pictures, contem-
porary dance, and poetry. it is being
presented in the South Lounge. tomorr
row night at 8:15 and 9:30,

Sounds intriguing, doesn't it'? Joe
Sohm. the producer, director,
photographer. and engineer of
- Imagination has said that it is a

- testimony to the power oi imagination,
an audiovisual poem to the beauty of
the future.

imagination is narrated by
William Shatner of “Captain Kirk"
“Star Trek" fame. It is a visual inter-
pretation of Gustav Holst's music,
The Planets, which Holst Wrote in

- 1914. Holst’s original piece has been

recorded electronically for
imagination and is played by
Japanese recording artist Isao
Tomita.

Imagination, which lasts only about
31 minutes, uses over 700 Color slide
transparencies and as many as i2 pro
jectnrs [In three, dorfoot screens, it
was first shown at the McDonnell
Planetarium in Forest Park, Missouri,
in 1977. That same year, it won a gold
medal in the Art and Music category
at the New York Film Festival.

NASA provided Sohm with several
hundred space shots, which he pro
cessed and re-colored. Sohm then add-
ed these slides to others which he took
himself. The slides have been jux-
taposed to create a story that follows
the narration by Shatner. RCA fur-
nished Sohm with most of the

If you thought the Film Committee
would have to stop getting expensive
movies sooner or later, you were
right. Intact. it turns out to be this
weekend, which is definitelvsooner
than later.

The best film this weekend, The Tall
Blonde Man With One Biack Shoe
(1973), is in French, with English subs
titles. The other, Watch on the Rhino
(1943), is so badly acted that even
Bette Davis can’t save it.

No audience ever enjoyed reading
subtitles; in fact, some audiences
won’t put up with them and walk out.
But if there was ever a film worth
reading subtitles for, it is Tire Tall
Blonde Man With One Black Shoe.

The complex plot revolves around a
man who, tor no good reason, gets in-
volved in a power struggle between
two French intelligence men. His
apartment gets thoroughly searched ’
and hugged; he is followed
everywhere. He is even seduced by
another intelligence agent.
Unbelievably. he never Catches on.

Several people are killed in his
apartment; at times, there are up to
three corpses hidden there, and he
doesn’t catch on. Even when shaving
cream is mistakenly put in his
toothpaste tube, he still doesn't Catch
on, '

The plot is only important as a vehiv
the for the comedy, which is slapstick.
French slapstick, is more
sophisticated than American slapstick,
involves high comedy, with the pure
slapstick played down. You won't see
an entire garage [all on anyone (as in
it's a Nlild, Mad, Mad, Mad Wni-ldt.
This is much more realistic, and,
therefore, more effective

One of the many hilarious scenes
depicts the tall blonde man being
seduced by a French intelligence
agent, when her hair gets caught in
his zipper.

The subtitles are a problem. but
you’ll get used to them beiore long,‘
and the movie is still worth seeing.

Watch on the Rhine, however, is
another story, A German. who works
ior an antirNazi group. and his
American Wife go to Washington,

to hide from the Nazis and to
t her iamily. Uniortunately, they
also run into a man who threatens to
turn them over to the Nazis.

The plot is better than it sounds. but
Lillian Hellmali's screenplay is too
moralistic and patriotic for my taste.
The patriotism can be excused (it’s
hard to set a movie in Washington
without some patriotism creeping in),
but there are several long-winded
moralizing speeches (the kind that
either have music behind them or else
you hear it. even though it’s not there)

technical recording equipment needed
to create the illusions of
imagination.”

Sohm says his work is meant to be
symbolically ”loose," He leaves the
analysis or imagination to the {an '
tasy ot the individual. This idea is
underscored by the narration in
imagination. “We are who we
dream. The young suddenly become
Wise and experienced, the shy are
bold, the old are again lithe and
firmiin imagination. We are the
heroes, the discoverers, the con-
querors. No challenge is too hazar-
dous, no gamble too risky in a world
where even the obstacles are of our
own making. We challenge ourselves
for the mere fun oi it—lo know the
pleasure oi putting our minds at

play.”

which serve no purpose and destroy
any interest you had in the plot.

Even with all this against it, the
lilm might be passable it only so
meone would teach the actors to act.
Everyone from the snot-nosed little
kid (who is German, but speaks better
English than anyone who grew up
speaking it) to his grandmother, and
including Bette Davis, seem to be
thinking about their next appointment
with their agent, You can tell not only
that they're acting. but that they’re
bored with acting,

The best bet this weekend is the car»
