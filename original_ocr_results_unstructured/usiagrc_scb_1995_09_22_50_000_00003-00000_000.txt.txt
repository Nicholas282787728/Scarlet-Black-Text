Circle of Friends

This is the story of a group of
Irish teens and their passage into
sexual maturity duringthe late 1950s.
One woman takes the center stage,
with most of the story line revolving
around her need to leave her small
town roots and explore the big city,
and her successive love affair with a
man she meets at college. The movie
is weak in its attempt to address the
types of problems facing the group of
teens: religious morals versus sexual
desire,devotiontoparents,and over»
all lifechoicesdtsolves thernwith an
ease and finality that lessens their
importance. lsuppose that this isjust
. feelegood film after all, and is on

hat level enjoyable.

aren‘t responsible for your actions.
Apparently, girls find this really
sweet. One chick, whom we’ll call
Gen D., was so moved by this movie
that she insisted I quote her. ”Don’t

this she is referring to me]. Rebel
against the movie reviewer." She
ranted, “Go. Go and sigh over Chris

Junior
This film is a continuation of

 

 

 

his affection towards the natural
world, ”One of my loves is to get
Convetsnnt with nature." His lm»
pressive photographs acknowledge
the success he has had in achieving
anintimacywith nature and allofits
beauty and life.

“I went into biology tnr one tea—

the chemistry that occurred between
Arnold Schwarzeneget and Danny
Devito in the movie Twins. If you
liked that one then I recommend
this one. The actual plot is the story
of two researchers who have devel—
oped a drug that halts miscarriages,
but the FDA won’t approve human
testing so they test it on themselves.
Arnold has afertilized egg implanted
in his body [don’t ask where] and he
eventually carries the baby to term
[come on people; suspension of diSt
belief], becoming the first man ever
to give birth. Emma Thompson also
stars in this film, giving it the needed
clutch hitter that Twins lacked. She
is wonderful, not especially in this
moVie, but in general. This film is
funny and I wouldn’t miss one of
Emma's films.

Counterpoint [Mateolzl thought
about watching junior, but then I
decided to gargle some lead paint
instead.

Terminal Velocity

I didn‘t watch this moVie, but
I’m gonna review it anyway. An ac«
tion packed thriller involving Char—
lie Sheen as the rebellious and good
looking hero figure who defeats a do—
badding, ugly, yet sinister evil guy
who gets it in the end. Of course,
somewhere between the fasttpaced
car chases and the final slugfest with

Arts & Entertainment - 3

the bad guy, Charlie Sheen will meet
and charm a miscellaneous attrac—
tive blonde chickwhowillaid him in
capturing head evil honcho guy. She
will probably kick a few men in the
balls to maintain the independent
woman image. I‘m guessing you’ll
probably see this attractive woman
naked, so all you skirt chasin’ swing»
ers out there, watch this movie. And
I’m also sure you’ll get to see a topless
Charlie, so all you man luvin‘ broads
out there better cornea runnin’. With
lots of big booms, and high ﬂying
antics, this movre, much like Dr.
Zhi‘vago, will keep you on the edge of
your seats.

Counterpoint [Taylor]: Ok, now
let me give it a try. Charlie Sheen is
aex—law enforcement officer of some
kind. A tragedy befalls him and he is
then reduced to a bum—like state.
After that, an emergencyarises which
demands his hero skills, he is called
in to action and begins to revert to
studly form even while his dark past
remains unconquered. The case he is
working on turns out to relate to his
past misfortune, and he discovers the
evil mastermind behind his down»
fall, There is an unneeded love affair
thrown in that allows gratuitous sex
scenes and naked bodies. Then the
finalscene comes when Charlie con—
fronts the evil mastermind and also

his own fear of the past. Charlie
conquershispastandkillsthevillain
in some new and fantastic way that is
actually the extent of creative
thought in this film. He lives happily
ever after with the shallow blonde,
until he needs money and makes a
sequel. Go see it and tell us which
one was theclosest to the actual plot.

Red

The last film in this trilogy, I
think was the best. This film tells of
a relationship between an old retired
judge, who spies on his neighbors,
and a young model who is uncertain
about the direction of her life. The
characters are fascinating, and the
way the story evolves is so subtle and
believable, it is brilliant. The movie
is spectacular and I will be seeing it
again this weekend, to see what more
I can glean from a second viewing.

Counterpoint (Mateo): Bitch—
in’ movie. Tastefully constructed and
beautifully tendered, thismoviepicks
up where White ended. Idon’t mean
to say that these movies were in any
significant way connected, aside from
an old woman with an urge to recycle
and a capsized ferry. While it lacks
the character development of the
Evil Dead trilogy, it rivals the Star
Wars trilogy in visual appeal, intox—
icating emotion. and number of
wookies.

 

son: aesthetics,”he says. ”I think it's
beautifulr" And he very quickly
adopted the hobbyof photography in
the seventh grade as a tool to docu—
ment his passion.

For the past four summers,
Campbell has led students, faculty
and alumni groups from Gtinnell on
excursions to investigate the natural
world in its biological and cultural
contexts. Nearly halfof the pictures
in the show were taken in the Ama—
zon jungle, where several of these
groups visited. Campbell praises the
Amazon jungle as “the earth’s great»
est bouquet of life,” representing a
great variety of species.

Many of the remaining photo—
graphs in the exhibitportray another
love of the biologist’s life: the Ant—
arctic region. Campbell is intrigued
by the very dissimilar expressions of
nature in the two regions: “The
Amazon is everything opposite of

the Antarctic.”

The show itself strives to portray
the individuality and natural beauty
of both distinct worlds and to share
with the public how they have “im—
bued my life with a lot of adventure
and discovery," as he says. All of the
photos were taken by professorCamp—
bell and capture the indigenous ani«
mal and plant life of each environ
ment in candid moments of inno»
cent beauty and magnificence.

Several photographs also reﬂect
theemphasisonculturewhichCamp—
bell’s journeys have taken, particue
larly through the interaction with
the Caboclo tribe of the Brazilian
Amazon. The Caboclo support a
strong cultural identity despite their
mixed African, European and Na—
tive American roots. Campbell says
ofthem, “I admire them. They have
the wonderful frontier hospitality,’I
which has been so invaluable to his
expeditions.

Campbell hopes that, in View—
ing the exhibit, people will be able to
identify the same appreciation for
the earth that he experienced in pho—
tographing it, and for people to gain
a respect for nature and life. “I want
people to love the planet, to protect
it," he says, because every being de-
serves consideration and respect.

Moreover, the exhibit celebrates
the aesthetic gifts of nature which
professor Campbell has graciously
encountered. He hopes that the show
will “teach people how to see, be—
cause seeing is a gift." For this jour—
nalist, to view a photo of a young
Caboclo girl and see the delight in
her face, for her life and her culture,
must be to see beyond all boundaries
and appreciate the potency of the
earth.
