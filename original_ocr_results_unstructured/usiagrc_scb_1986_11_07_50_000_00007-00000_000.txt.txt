Homophobic Acts Scorned

Dear Editor.

When I turn on the local TV news and
hear at all the atrocities and injustices in
the world today. I take Solace in the
thought that Grinnell is a liberal, open-
minded. peaceful society, At least that's
what I had done in the past. Last Thurss
day. like any other day. i went to the post
oiiice to check my mail. Much to my
delight. I Iound an envelope inside my mail
box. When I opened it I was horrified to
find a ﬂier in it that said:

”Buttlucking Fagots in the Pub!! . .
, Moms. Dads. Prevent tragedy like
this irom happening in your tamiiy.
it you suspect your son may be gay
SHOOT HIM!”

I was and am horrified! How could
something so vile and stupid come irom
the Grinnell College campus

ARH Renovation

Dear Editor.

The recent report of the plans tor the
ARH rennovation is extremely disturbing.
while I applaud the administration ior its
interests in expanding the college’s audio
visual iacilities, I am greatly concerned
With what these plans suggest for the cam-
pus film and entertainment program.

Week end films have become. in many
ways. the only consistent refuge ior works
weary students in search oi a positive
diversion alid release. ARM is an essential
part oi this entertainment Under present
plans. the only large screen Viewing area
on campus will be the South Lounge of the
rourm This is unacceptable for two
reasons: South Lounge has limited seating
room and is less flexible for scheduling
than ARH.

without an auditorium that has a large
seating capacity this campus will lose one
of the last places where students are able
to gather in a mass and as a community
Gone will be the days when all students
can meet casually in a central. campus
location, Furthermore, the more relaxed
atmosphere or the large auditorium is
more conducive to a general release oi ten
sion 7 whether yelling or drinking or both
—- than South Lounge‘s more restrained ata
mosphere. South Lounge is an excellent
place to view good cinema. but ARH is a
more ﬂexible auditorium to meet and let
out tension.

Second. because of its numerous other
uses. South Lounge is only available for
one week night and the weekend. Even if it

community?

[write this not so much to bring this to
the attention oi the campus. but to question
the intentions and morality oi the people
who sent the flier.

Just who do you think you are?! What
gives you the right to pass judgment on
others? Are you so perfect that you can’t
even tolerate others for being different?
And this business about shooting people
because of their sexual preferences . . . in
your eyes perhpas we should execute intera
racial couples as well.

what ever happend to “Love thy neighor
as they sell?” Instead of looking {or a
speck oi sand in your neighbor's eye. you
should work on extracting the log oi
bigotry lrom your own eyes. — Sara

Criticized

could seat everyone who wanted to see a
Riven film. the film program would have to
be cut in half. The loss of the main Viewing
screen on campus would require that
fewer movies be shown every week. This
would constrain any variety to the film
program and would make the decision oi
what to do on a Friday night that much
easier tor everyone — iewer options,

This situation is only aggravated by the
closing of the Pub and the limited number
of allacampus events. The loss ol the ARH
auditorium would be felt by the campus
every weekend. While the administration
is right to expand educational facilities.
there remain a Iew baSic social necessities
to long winters in the middle oféi cornfield.
One of the reasons that I chose to come to
Grinnell over comparable institutions was
the noteworthy activities calendar, It
changes such as the elimination of a large
part oi the campus film program occur. I
cannot say that I would make the same
choice again

A writer in this journal has claimed.
“The school is here for the students." If
this is true than the administration should
provide an alternative large screen
auditorium to replace ARH. But students
must make their opinions known through
letters. general discussion. and the Stun
dent Government. It is not an argument
for hedony that requests a way to relax
alter a long week. Grinnell is an
academically rigorous institution 7 its
students deserve a break Kev.“ O'Prey

“Paul. what the hell are you doing at
Grinnell?”

I was sitting in a McDonald's in Ames.
iowa. eating cheeseburgers with a high
school buddy of mine. who I was visiting
ior the day. Actually, he was the one eating
cheeseburgers. 1 was sitting there with my
mouth open. dumbly staring out the win-
dow at the incredible number and variety
oi students who were wandering past. The
guy I was with, like the majority or my
high school iriends, was attending a large
state university. Somewhere along the line
I had made a decision against enrolling in
such a school and had opted instead to
spend [our years or my life at a small.
private liberal arts college located in a
quiet. rural community about sixty miles
trom anything which could accurately be
described as a city. Unfortunately. to my
befuddlement. I couldn't remember exact»
ly why. .

”I don't know." I answered honestly. “I
Just don’t know."

Somewhere in the back of my head I
remembered that there were plenty oi
good reasons {or attending a small col~
lege; there were plenty of advantages that
a student at a school such as Grinnell
would have over a student at. say. the,
University oi Iowa. The usuals spring to
mind: smaller classes. higher faculty»
student ratio. computer access. warmth.
intimacy. etc.. etc

During my selection process i had
carefully weighed all those factors like a
serious. responsible student who cares
about his education should. However. all
those pluses and ininuses which I had
meticulously added and subtracted. com-
pared and contrasted. analyzed and
evaluated. all those things whlcli had
seemed so important then seemed more
distant and less relevant as I watched one
sleek. gorgeous ISU coed alter another
pass beiorc my awestruck eyes. indeed.
Paul. I thought, what the hell are you doing
at Grinnell”

That's not to say that there‘s aliything
wrong with women at Grinnell In fact. the
only thing that really bothers me about
Grinnell women is their small number
Let's lace it. there simply aren't as many
as there are at state schools. and they pm-
bably aren‘t nearly as gullible. At a state
school. a determined resourceiui young
man could con thousands of different girls
into dating him. and they probably
wouldn‘t even know each other. making it
impossible ior them to warn one another
when this aforementioned young man

came sidling by. Not that I would ever be
capable oi such teats oi swinging
bachelorhood. but the mere idea of it being
possible sent my ireshman brain spinning,

0i course. at this point the reader is pro
bably asking. ”You stupid jerk. why didn’t
you think of that before you decided to go
to Grinnell?"

That's exactly the question I was asking
myself as I sat there in mute bewilder~
ment, staring my myopic eyeballs out at
girl atter girl aiter girl,

Well. that was almost a month ago. and
during the week long (all break which con
Veniently Iell between then and now. I took
it upon myself to continue my ioray into
large university lite and determine exactly
what it was that I’ve been missing, while
at the same time. hopeiully, dispelling all
my new-found doubts about/“the Grinnell
Experience.”

So oii I went to Champaigne-Urbana and
the sprawling campus oi the University or
Illinois Those of you familiar with this ins
stitution probably know that although the
place is literally swarming with muscular,
attractive bodies. and the campusgalso
contains the largest fraternityrsorority
system in the country. and it is rare that
one locates a pretty girl who doesn't have
those damn Greek letters branded across
the seat of her sweatpants, This (act is
discouraging to nonaGreeks on campus. As
one of my friends there would say. “Down
here at U of I. we don't take l(indlv to
strangersor dorm guys "

And that‘s not the worst bl it. As I was
sneaking unaccompanied into one oi the
locked. all-female dorms to visit a friend. i
was suddenly jumped by a young woinall
in jammies. who demanded. "Are you an
R,A."" Apparently. the entire campuswas
under a big rape scare. and being an uii»
chaperoned. unauthorized male. alone in
an allegirl dorm, was a big no-no. I could
Just see myseli. mistaken as a r pist by
this paranoid. delenseless dol‘ln .slapa
ped into cuiis by campus police. and
thrown across the hood of the nearest large
American car I could almost hear the
fateful Words as the olIicer tears the wallet
irom my pocket. and slowly says. ”[lc‘s
from Grinnell . , book'em "

Fortunately for me. that incident never
occurred. I managed to escape belorc the
police arrived. However. as before the
mere tact that it was possible madc me
start discreetly longing ior the safe. open
security oi my unlocked room in North
Younker Hall, It was then that I realized
exactly why I had chosen Grinnell, I like
girls. but I really hate police stations

“Administration seems Arbitrary”

Dear Editor.

I have been trying to iigure this place out
for over three years. The administration
seems to make weird. arbitrary, non»
sensical decisions. and stick by them
Ianatically. It all Seems so strange. But I
think i understand now. I was assuming
that the administration is here for the good
ol the students. WRONG, The administra-
tion is here to test us or something, They
aren't trying to cooperate. they are trying
to mess us up in general: whevenever a
thing is liked and used by students. it has
to be removed.

Take the Health Center as an example.
The Health Center was great. Aquiet place
to sleep and not iniect your iriends. There
was even an increase in use last year. why
don’twe have it now? It was good. it had to

go.

ARH auditorium is another good examr
pie. A place where a good percentage of us
students can go and see a movie. Grinnell
is pretty dull. so it is nice to be able to see a
movie every once in a while. right?
Naturally. it must be removed.

The new Logo also makes sense now.
Every year they have to put ireshman in
lounges. We need new students like we
need another cyclone. Naturally, any
method of getting more students. no mat
ter how bizarre. is of interest to the ad»
ministration,

I have just one question ii 1 was in a
position of authority in The Real World.
and I sent four men out to change a light
bulb. would I be a) fired. b) laughed at. or
cl sent to Grinnell to replace Dale Hawn?
