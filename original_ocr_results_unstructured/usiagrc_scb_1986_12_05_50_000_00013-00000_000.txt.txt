With Rules

by Justin Lincoln

in the wake oi recent additions to basket
ball scoring rules. the NCAA will introduce
appendages to the rules or several sports
in 1987. -

0n the gridiron. points awarded ior ﬁeld
goals will be determined by kicking
distance According to the new rules, tield
goals of 25 yards or less will be worth the
traditional 3 points. those between 25 and
41.! yards will be worth 4 'points, while any
greater than 40 yards will gain 5 points.
Exceptional kickers will also have the op»
portunity to score 10 points by kicking the
' ball through the uprights in a kickoir
situation

In addition. touchdowns scored on runs
”of less than 30 yards will still earn the scars
ing team 6 points. but longer scoring runs
will be awarded one additional point for
every 10 yard increment exceeding the
30- -yard minimum. It is hoped that this
strategy will bring the running game back
to football. thereby reducing the number at
injuries and eliminating the Vinny
Testaverdes and the nationally ranked
Brigham Young teams,

*‘A'H‘kin

Baseball will be altered in a similar
manneri Home runs which leave the play-
ing area lrom‘the left or right fields will
result in the usual scoring. However, balls
hit over the centerfield fence will be worth
twice as much. it has not yet been decided
whether baserunners in such cir-
cumstances will be counted double too.
The exact positions of the dividers for the
scoring areas is a matter of heated
dispute. Likewise, rielders that hang onto
a catch after running into a wall or another
fielder will be given two outs. Following
the examples of basketball and football
baseball pitchers will be subject to time
limits between pitches,
