Fire--And Other Hazard;

The recent investigation of fire conditions on campus
by the State Fire Prevention Association had many inter»
esting sidelights, in addition to unearthing hazards which
warrant immediate attention.

The association, a voluntary organization, was invited
here by the administration. They came, saw, and made a
report which unfortunately was incomplete, vague, and in
some cases erroneous. The errortcrept in at points of in-
terpretation from the code books in which the initial haz-
ards were listed, or by point of omission where the ambie
tion to do a thorough job was lacking. The errors of in
terpretation were corrected doing a second visit to the cam-
pus by the president and secretary of the organization

Not remedied were errors of omission. To this end
S & B has and will apply itself, in order to make recom-
mendations to the administration and the student body for
éhe alleviation of conditions which could lead to disastrous
lres. -,

Meanwhile, we are compiling a list of such recommen-
dations, for presentation to the administration, which will
include our version, plus that of the organization, on what
should be corrected.

We have been taken to task by the treasurer “for not
checking the facts with the administration," before publica-
tioli, in specific cases wherein housekeeping policy does not
permit (or admit) of the violations indicated. We submit
that

 

a. whether contrary to “policy” or not, the violations
listed in the three S & B stories were witnessed by our
reporter and a member of the inspection team, and

b. . in any such case, consultation with the administra-
tion on what is right or wrong by “policy” amounts to prior
censorship, to which the S & B is thus far not required to
submit.

We are aware that by far tlle greatest percentage of
fires on this campus have been a matter of strident negli-
gence. We are also aware that fire is no respector of the
availability of funds required to make the campus safe to
the point of protection even from panic. On this last point
considerable argument would center on the expensive deco-
ration of Loose hall lounge and the chapelfin spite of the
fact that gifts are earmarked.

Unreasonable? Yes, but fire is also unreasonable.
Costly to insure adequate protection? Yes, but so is a dis-
aster like that which recently occurred at Kenyon college.
And in the matter of a loss of life, no one can fix a price-
tag.

Cooperation from both the students and the adminis»
tration is vital. In no other way can we go as far as we
should toward making Grinnell as safe as possible.

Sociological Survey Guides
Prospecl‘ive Teel‘o’ralers

“Factors Related to the Use of Liquor by College Girls” was
the subject ol 3 study made by Maxine Shelton, Loose hall Senior,
and Patricia Hansen, Read junior. An article they wrote about
their experiment appears in the sprin edition or The Mid-West
Sociologist, olticial publication of the idwest Sociological society.

Two-thirds oi the junior wo- f,
men on campus filled out ques»
tionnaires regarding their drink-
ing habits. No distinction was
made between beer and other!
a1coho1ic beverages.

The results of the survey can
be used by women who do not
want lo drink. The following
rules will help avoid exposure
to liquor:

First, don’t date, because wo-

‘ Engineers Improve
Reception of KGRW;
Schedule Resumed

”We have our Voice back.”
KGRW proclaimed this week in
Roeder-type posters, The cams

stronger, clearer voice Monday
night, after a tworweek Silence.

Chief engineer Jack Sheriff
invites students to listen for
themselves. He said that imr
movements in the transmitter
and the wiring system encircling
the campus have produced no
ticeably better reception in all
north and south campus halls.

“All KGRW needs now is lis-
tenel‘s," admitted George Hal-
sey, student manager of college
radio activities. “I think we've
got programs that will attract
an audience: radio dramas and
music by students and radio and
Hollywood celebrities, as well as
nightly programs of popular
and classical music.”

”We’ll increase our broadr
casting time when we’re cone
Vinced that our audience wants
more of KGRW,” promised Hale
sey. “By leaving the air at 10
pm, we lose the listeners who
turn on their radios after dates,"
