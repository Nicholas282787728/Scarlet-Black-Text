The State Meet held at Grinncii last

At the present outlook it seems prob
able that Nebraska will take the cov-
eted trophy which has graced the tro-
phrcase in Grinnell lor the past year.
altho either Kansas or Missouri may
take the first honors. Tile Iowa schools,
with the exception of the state univerr

The sprints will be marked by the
meeting or Haddock ot Kansas and
Wilson oi coe, alld Reed oi Ne-
broslin. All three men are exception-
ally inst and with a good track the
hundred should go under ten tiat.
Wilson's poriormnnce last Friday in
ice two-twenty gives him the pret-
erence in that race.

.The quarter will bring out some good
men in Wilson, oi Coo, Burke and Read

oI the loud Colirel-eutc colleges the
titles uele t- hanged allowing all athlete
to elitrr an intertolicgiute contest nitcl
a lesidcllce oi months. As n rc-
slilt ot this change the rule linilting an
athlete to there years at competition
was changed lo allow him to compete
iour years. These chdnltes were made
lit the urgent request of the smaller
colleges wllich wanted to join the con-
lerence but on account or the small
number of students in their collegiate
department were either unable to piit
eligible teams in the ﬁeld at all, or else
were not able to pilt out teams that
colild compete iiitli other colleges on a
raw basis.

it has been tit-ﬁnitely settled that the
change in the rules will make no
change in the poll l ilt Grinneil. Oui-
athletic relations with the Missouri
Valley and Chicago Conference demand
that “C in all our athletic contests
should maintain the one year residence
rlile, wllh on aggregate or three years
conlliet inn.

It is very plohatlle that several oi
the lowa Colleges, such as Coe and Col-
nell, \vlll also maintain the higher
standard, it is hoped that the new rule,
will serve to strengthen the conference
by bringing to it the support or the
smaller colleges and at the some time
enable these colleges to put out team
that can tolnpete on a lair basin with

the iar gcr institutions.
