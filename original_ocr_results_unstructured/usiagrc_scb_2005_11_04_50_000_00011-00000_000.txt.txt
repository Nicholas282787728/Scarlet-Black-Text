Grinnell cross country races to another pair of MWC titles '

3v ANDV CHON

The tension was high at the Oak—
land Acres Golfcollrse last Sound
10 schools competed in the men's and
women’s ch cross country champir
onships,

Spectators held their breath as they
watched athletes from Grinnell and
Carroll shave their legs and weigh their
leg hair on a scale.

The runners were competing in
what is known as “The Stud Factor," 3
Competition that took plaee in tandem
with this ye Irs MWC ehanrpronshrps.

“Its a diffelent conference chim-
pionship beclusc Carroll was tired of
the race not being about the conference
title," said Justin Riley ’06.

The Grinnell men and women's
cross country teams have dominated
the lVlWC for so long that rival schools
are creating other competitions in order
to maintain their competitive spirit.

The scoring system for The Stud
Factor required the runner’s to shave
their legs.

“Finish time is divided by the dry
mass of the leg hair in grams," said Rit
ley.

Although this competition gave
Carroll the ﬁghting chance they were
looking for, the Pioneer rnen emerged
shaved and victorious, handily winning
The Stud Factor as well as the MWC
championship.

The men had a much closer race

thrn usual this vent due to injuries
rmong .r handful ofGrinncll s top rune
“BIS.

“Dave Honig '06 had a couple back
spasms and he wasn‘t sure if he could
run," snid Riley. “Pretty much all our
number three guys were having Imus
ble."

“We didn’t really have r best race,
but we did enough to win said jordan
Glaser :05, "The longer you've been in
this program, the more you reahze that
the only team that can beat us is our-
selves."

Although the men were very confre
denrgoing into the meet, they still took
the competition very seriously.

“[Coach Will Freeman] was making
sure that we weren't going to undercsr
timatc the meet. In the past years we've
just been looking ahead to regionals,"
said Adam Beals '06. “We won confer-
encc every year that I've been here so I
didn’t want to blow it as a senior. We
were conﬁdent, but wary of the othel
teams.”

The Pioneer women left their come
petition in the dust, winning the MWC
title by one of the largest margins in
MWC history

“We performed better than we ext
pected. The men’s team generally wins
with a huge margin," said Erin Booth
'07, ”I'm not used to thinking of the
women’s team in that way, not yet any—
ways.”

 

 

 

Some members ofthe women’s team
are more than ready to give the men a
run for their money at the regionals in
Wartburg on the 12th.

“We feel like warriors, kings of the
world or queens of the world actually,"
said Cori Mckenzie '06. “We’re not
going to take any shit from the men‘s
team and we’re going to call them out if
they try to give us any."

After last weekend's performance.
the women are clearly ahead in the
ongoing friendly competition between
the men and women’s teams.

“They were stellar,"said Beals. “We
talked about having a competition
about who would score less points and
they totally kicked our asses on that
one. we had to swallow our pride, but
I’mjust stoked that we both won."
