Grinnell
defeats
Ripon,

history

Pioneers beat Red Hawks for
the ﬁrst time since' 1998 thanks
to a last-second touchdown pass

by Kevin Byrne

Grinnell football hadn’t beaten conference foe Rip
pon College since 1993, and was coming offa disape
pointing 3-7 2003 campaign that included a season
opening 26-21 loss to the Red Hawks. But there was
something different about this particular mrm, sunny
Saturday afternoon, however, as the Pioneers battled
the visiting Red Hawks for 60 minutes. There were
over 400 fans in attendance to witness an amazing
second halfcomeback, capped oftby a fourth quarter
10»play, 93-yard drive to win it by a score of 2724.
The victory over Ripon gives the Pioneers an early
advantage in the Midwest Conference standing, at
1—0.

“It is always good to win the ﬁrst
game,” said head coach Greg Wal-
lace, “and very important since it was
a conference game as well.”

Wallace got the effort out his
players that he needed, keeping the
game within reach while struggling
in the first half, and chipping away in
the second.

The game got off to a good start
for Grinnell, as they answered Rie
pon’s openin drive touchdown with a touchdown
of their own. Quarterback Sean Pfalzer ‘07 hit Chris
Villa ’05 with a 47 yard pass down the sideline on
the third play from scrimmage. On the third play of
last year’s game against Ripon, Pfalzer had suffered a
season-ending foot injury, but it was a different story
this year, as Pfalzer would earn Midwest Confer-
ence Player of the Week honors for his performance
on the field. After a missed extra point, however, the
Pioneer offense struggled and the defense gave up 14
unanswered points in the second quarter. Ripon full-
back Tom DePietro had a great day rushing the ball,
as he rumbled for 137 yards on 30 carries. The de-

fensive line had a difficult time containing DePietro
throughout the game, but did get to the quarterback
in the second half.

“We got the job done but we didn’t achieve all of
our goals," said AlleConference defensive lineman
Delwin Pinkins ‘05. “They were not that explosive, it
was just that the fullback was two
yards off the QB’s tush-tush. Like
Eightball and M10 say, ‘They
don't want no drama.”

Despite what Eightball and
MJG want, football fans Satnr~
day got plenty of drama. Grinnell
went into the half trailing 2L6,
on the verge ofbeing knocked out
of the contest. However, the Pie»
neers came out of the locker room
fired up and ready to put some points on the board.

“Coach Hollibaugh [the defensive coordinator]
made a few defensive changes for the second half,”
said Wallace, “and offensively we just wanted to be
more consistent."

The defensive changes worked, as the line slowed
down DePietro, and Pinkins drilled Ripon quarter-
back Bob Faulds deep in Ripon territory, forcing a
costly fumble in the third quarter.The offense, which
had already scored on its ﬁrst possession in the pe
riod, responded, as Nate Wineinger ‘05 plowed into
the end zone from five yards out. (Wineinger finished
with 106 yards on 16 carries.) A fake extra point then
turned to gold, as Trey Rancy ‘05 found Villa in the

corner of the end zone for a twoepoint conversion
that pulled Grinnell to within 21-20.

Ripon responded with a field goal to make it 24»
20, and pinned the Pioneers with a well—placed punt
on their own seven yard line with 3:11 to play in thc
game, Thus set the stage for one of the most amaze
ing drives in recent Pioneer history, as Pfalzer led his
team down the field with a series ofperfectly placed
first-down passes and a key scramble.

“My main concern was getting the next first down
until we crossed midfield," said Pfalzer. “and then I
was focused on getting in the end zone."

His focus paid off, because with 33 seconds on the
clock, Pfalzer found Raney with a soft lob to the back
of the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown. The drive
spanned 93 yards and 2:38.

“It felt great to take the lead," said Pfalzer, "but in
the back ofmy mind I was thinking about overtime."

Overtime was not necessary, as the Pioneer den
fense held Ripon to a long ﬁeld goal try that was left
well short ofthe crossbar, and sealed the victory The
team did not celebrate long, however, as rhcy are now
preparing to take on Lake Forest College this Saturn
day in Lake Forest, Ill. It will be another conference
test, and another chance for the Pioneers to improve
their record. “Lake Forest is rated in the top three of
our conference this year," said Wallace. “They have an
excellent defense, and their offense is throwing the
hall more this year. We must clean up some mistakes
from this last week, and work hard on improving on
what we do on offense and defense."

soccer team, as they erased memories of
a 4-3 defeat in the 2003 campaigu.The
women head for Minnesota this week-
end to meet MIAC opponents Bethel

loss to Augsburg on
home turf last October
will certainly be on the
minds of the Pioneers
who open the season
with three traditions

schools in their first
four games.

The home season

again eight minutes into the second
half, as Rachel Moskowitz ‘06 assists
ed Kate Diedrick ’07 to put Grinnell,
which outshot the Knights 20-8, up by
the eventual final score on-O. Accord-

' the MIAC confer
ence in Minnesota
are a true test for
the Pioneers.

"We want to
continually push
ourselves to the
next level," she said,
”and playing the
MIAC schools al-
lows us to do that
as we prepare for our league opener
against Beloit on Sept. 18." The trips
to Minnesota will, Benning hopes, pres

cal as several teams, including Grinnell
and the Lake Forest squad who defeate
ed the Pioneers leo in last year's cone
fercnce filial, appear to be legitimate
contenders. The Midwest Conference
coaches selected St. Norbert and Car-
roll to ﬁnish third and fourth, behind
Grinnell and Lake Forest. Benning
agreed that “the MWC tournament is
any team’s for the taking and we Will
have to sustain our work ethic and pos-
itive attitude."

A victory I" the conference tourna»
ment would send the women a fin?
round match in the NCAA tournae
ment, a place they haven’t been in ﬁve
years. When asked it’NCAAs is a legire

replied, “Absolutely."

Benning is optimistic about the
team improvements made since last
season, citing depth, attitude and work
ethic as the most improved aspects of
the 2004 team:
