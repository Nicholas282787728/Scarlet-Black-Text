itlcs but the words of pr [or
his p ty uould be much lie‘
the truth it there were more Rec

He is one oi the low Repub-
licans who signed the discharge
petition to get a civil rights
bill out oi tiic itulcs oornmit—

Rather than criti 2e his stator
mcnt of the Republican position,
we should be critlwl oi the fact
that he is not suiiieiently inﬂu-
ential in determining it.

To the Editor: '

The work oi Bill Siskel and
the Social Coordinating commit—
tee in cngaging the Roger Wag-
ncr Chorale on short notice is,
worthy or praise and gratitude.

The decision to use Herrick
chapel ior the concert increased
the intimacy between the per-‘
iormers and the audiencc, and
the program was considerably
better than it would have been
in Darby.

Bringing more large
such as the Roger Wagner
Chorale will provide us with
a greater varicty of programs,’
and will give us grcater value|
for our investment.

A change in the type oi con-
cert and the quality of music
was needed. Thanks to the Stu-
dent council and to Bill Siskell

Concerning some of the pay
ters_used in the Student Counr
eil president elections:
Although “anything" goes
when it comes to advertising
and ballyhooinga product or a
person, i find that borrowing
»irom the scriptures is going iust
a little too far. It shows a lack
of respect, imagination and

taste.

To the Editor:

Because i survrvcd the Student
council convention, l have had
no opportunity to thank publicly
those who did so much lor me,
To Bill Kell who ran my cam.
paign, to Bob Nor 's, Nancyi
Schmulbach and Ernie Rutherr
ford who spoke .ior me, to the
men of Cowles who supported
me and especially to those indi
viduals who because ot my late
entry changed sides and incurred
the wrath and anger ot others, i
will always be grateful.

To the Editor:

Peace by mutual terror, the
condition under which we are
now living, is a dead end—lite
erally a dead end. Still. we
realize, albeit somewhat tran-
tically, that we must keep on,
winning the arms race until
something replaces arms as a

'sateguard to our national secur-
ity and preventative at world
eonllict. The arms race is a

, dead end. Is there a way out?

Nationally, settlement of le-
gal disputes is achieved not
by iorce or threat or torce, but
by law. it New York state

state ot lowa, justice is deter-

l'iiil process,

Iowa can lli‘llllCY threaten Ncw‘
silos nor m,
lusc to appc- belore the Sn»
prumc Court. Justice and peace
are served and preserved lav
law. This is not true interna-
\ionally. internationally, JustiCCi
is still Optional,

The only torcseeablc way out
is international lustice by rule
of law. The machinery for dis-
passlonatc judicial determination
of disputes between sovereign
states already exists. Tht: lnicrr
national Court of Justice (ICJ),
an organ or the United Nations
organization, is‘ composed or 15
Judges elected for nine-year
terms, live every three years,
by a majority vote oi both the
U.N General Assembly L32 na-
tions) and the Security Council,

They are paid $20,000 plus
certain expenses annually. But
the courtroom is cmpty. In 13
years the court has Settled
less than 20 disputes, and on
the United States rests il large
part of the blame lor its cmpr
tincss.

In 1946 the United States Sena,
ate accepted iurlsdiclion of thel
lCJ in speciﬁed areas of Inter
national law stated in the Stat-
ute of the Court, but in no case
in “disputes with regard to mat-V
tors which are essentially with»i
m the domestic jurisdiction of
the United States, as determined
by the United States."

The UN Charter says, “Noth»
ing contained in the present
Charter shall authorize the Unit-
ed Nations to intervene in mat-
ters which are essentially with.
in the domestic iurisdiction of
any state or shall require the
members to submit such matters
to settlement.”

As you see, when we accept-
ed jurisdiction of the ICJ, we
were not satisﬁed with this
guarantee but, taking a severe-
ly limited Vicw of the “nationc '5
31 interest," reserved the right
to determinc unilaterally when
thel' or not the Subject mat-
ter or a particular dispute is
within the domestic jurisdic—
tion of the UiS.

This resolution has boomer-
zmgcd and will continue to do .50
if it is not repealed. For ex-
ample, a recent complaint for
$1,300,000 in damages was filcd
by the United States in the
court against Russia for Shoot-
ing down one of our unarmed
planes over the Sea of Japan.
Russia tiled an answer saying
thc‘shooting was within her do—,

mastic jurisdiction. This simple,
claim required the court to sums,
marily dismiss the complaint.

Jurisdiction by the KC] in
actual non-domestic legal disc
Dukes is in the United Slates’
national interest. It will not
interfere with US. domestic
concerns. It will adversely iii-
iect the international Commu-
nist conspiracy. It may well
be the cause of the survivill
of mankind.

Senate Resolution 94 calls (or

SCA. LET AND BLACK

Notes From
The
Underground

by

(With apologies to a wonder»
hil tradition in American iolk
music.)

Now, if you go to Grinnull
let me tell you what to do;
you’ve got to talk to the fellows
in the hall with you; you’ve got
to build you a council, got to
make it strong. But it you stick
together, well, it won't be long7
you'll get doors for the Union,
money for KG, vacations on
time , , . get a job in the post
odice,

It’s not quite so simple so
1 better explain just why
you’ve got to jump at: the
"apathy train." 'Causc it you
wait tor the trustees to start
a ”new" Grinncll, we’ll all
be waiting as we sit in hell—
“'6’“ all be “sacking,” won
rying about “state issues" . i .
Satan will be (13an then.

Now, you know you‘ve got a
voice, but you never can be
heard. You need a government
that will listen to your word.
The council may be defunct, but
it can be saved. We can get to
Bowen with all that's craved-
talk it ever, speak our minds
. decide to do something
about it.

’Course, the jocks may per-
suade some poor dumb guy to
go to a meeting and raise a
cry, But you can always tell a
nebbish, that’s a iact, by his
shapcless brain and his wells
shaped back . he doesn‘t
have to be a nebbish, he’ll alv
ways get along . . i on some-
body Else's liquor.

You’ve got a council now,
and you’re sitting pretty. Put
some 0! the brains on a “So-
cial Action committee.” Con-
gress won't listen when Bow-
en squawks, but they've got
to hear us when the whole
school talks. They'd butler?
be mighty lonely away
irom 0.0. everybody
voting against them.

Saga working you so hard
that it's iust outrageous? And
paying you all starvation wages?
You go to the Bobs, and they
nicely gri : “I know your pay
is low, isn’t it a sin? But the
trustees set the pay, and those

Naida Tushuct

sages say next year‘s trend is,

for higher wages.”

The guys were pulling big
cigars, iccling mighty slick
’cause ey thought they had
coed di 'ng licked. Well, they
looked in the paper and what
did they see: that the major»
ity of students all agree‘l’s
a “blast," lots of run, chance
to meet new people.

At Grinnell March is the
hardest time, mud on the Pan]-
pus, hour exams down the line,
The “econ” department thinks
it’s got plagiarism down: last»
notes extend all the way to
town

Women’s week comes, and the
girls ask out the boys, trying
to awaken their to social poise
¥”Macbeth” all week; chorale,
too . . . no time to learn, too
much to do.

But at those other schools

here‘s what they round, and
at the couierenees here's what

EZen, Taoism;
lProi Speaks
On Religions

DY. Huston Smith, clinil’-‘
mall 01' the philosophy tie-i
nurtment ilt the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technolo-
gy, was to have discussed
Buddhism this afternoon at
.4115 at a coffee hour in
lYotlnller lounge. It is the,
second of three talks span»
sored by the Board of Religv
ion. onlorl'ow morning at 11,
Smith will speak on Zen
Buddhism and Taoism in
Herrick chapel.

Dr. Smith is the author oi the
‘book' “World Religions,” recent
ly published by Mcntor in pa.
perback lorm This book is an
adaptation ol work Smith did
in preparation tor a television
series on world religions in St
Louis, while teaching at Waslh
ington university. His Grinneill
|talks will be bascd on this
,series.

i According to Howard R Blirr‘,

:klc (philosophy and i'eliglun),:
“Dr. Smith is a dynamic speak-l
or who can effectively prc ntl,
his material. if students ho.-
him once, they will go back to.
hear him again,”

lluniors’ Party;
“The Voidesi"

Abstract paper tor-ins earrving
out the “voidest” theme will
set the lone lor the junior class
party tonight. Dancing to hivfi
linusic will begin at 9-30 in the
private dining room.

The informal party is for junr
iors only and is not a date
affair. Judy Dccker will give
a humorous reading, and Jim
Lowry, Tony Fathman and the
Scarleteers are slated for pos
sible performance. Crackers and
dips will be served with punch.

‘ back to

the fold

The other day as l sdl in die
Scarlet and Black oHicc watch-
ing the snow grow. a couple
walked by toward the tratks.

A train came down the
tracks, and somehow the girl
got across before the boy,
leaving them separated. All
they could do was to wave to
each other between the cars.
it was a very long train, and
it seemed a very long time
bcioro the two students were
united again to continue their
walk.

Being an English major.
immediately referred to
"Pocket Guide to Symbols
for a meaning, L
ing under “Boy-Girl Sepa
by Seemingly Endless Fi
Train," i tound this deﬁnition;
”Separation, lack ol communica-
tion caused by ii ur ounlaale
obstacles, usually physical or so—
cial in nature."

Solet's pretend that the t ks
and cars are distance and mo-
tion. The distance between north
and south campusithg mot on
of two separate colnniuni'ies
each with its own tradition, .aiv
and taboo.

Let’s call the couple‘s wav-
ing, between the ears of Dis
tance and Difference, coed eitl~
ing and open-open tlormyin
other words, attempts tthough
not vcry satislyingl to com-
municate over the natural b
riers oi the Grinnell soc f;
To ﬁnd real communication

must either - t for line
tr n to pass, which may ncz-er
be, or we may uncouplc
cars in the middle, though
would be very difficult and
gerous as the train is constartly
moving, thus reinforcing -he
Tradition and Separation.

There are those who would
wait, and there are those who
would jump up and uncouplc
the cars immediately. But at
this point i am not sure that
the uncoupling is either pos-
sible or feasible. Other schools
(50 I am told) have tlone it,
but would it really help to
break down the barriers at
Grinnell?

For those who havc watc:ed
the train with growing con .rn

I

my

w

discuss.at its length, this column is not

so ambiguous as it appears. To
those who have not looked at
the train, 1 would suggest they
do so. Because whatever we ties
aide to do in relation to :he
train will have to be done by
all the students.
