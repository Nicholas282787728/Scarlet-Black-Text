prestigious awards. Students have
won the Rhodes and Marshall
Scholarships,andGrinnellwasone
of only three colleges with three
Watson Fellowship recipients. To
Drake, this demonstrated a marked
change in the student body.

In a subsequent interview with
the Scarlet and Black, Drake said,

Committee Urges Multiculturalism
in Curriculum and Environment

By Kim Eckart

Last September, the President’s
Com mittee for a Stronger Minority
Presence (PCSMP) urged the col»
lege to add faculty of color and
emphasized the importance of a
multicultural environment

The nine-member committee
retumed last month to evaluate
Grinnell’s progress and com-
mended the college on the serious
consideration of the suggestions
presentedatthe fall meeting. Grin-
nell’s recent addition of three mul-
ticultural [acuity members showed
evidence of that consideration.

But while the addition of three
multicultural faculty is an impres-
sive beginning, said committee
chair Dr. Randall Morgan, there is
still work to be done.

According to Morgan, the com-
mittee, composed of nine African-
American alumni. was impressed
with the sincerity of the college
community, especially the faculty,
concemingthecreationofamultic-
ultural environment. “The Execu-
tiveCouncil of theFaculty gaveour
suggestions 2 lot of time We felt
they were honestly considering our
dilemma," he said. Morgan also
emphasized that not only was fac»
ulty recruitment a focus of the
meeting, but the development of a
multicultural curriculum was dis»
cussed as well. Because multi-cuL

dent body, he said, “The curricu-
lum should reﬂect positions of
minorities through history, not just
the Euro-centric views." He added
that the committee realizes that
changes in the curriculum and the
composition of the faculty are not
an easy nor an immediate process.

“The main thing is that the
commiunenttomulticulturalissues
must be an ongoing thing, and this
group is committed to keeping
something going," Morgan said.
“We‘remoreintotheprocessnow—

lion."

According to President George
Drake, the Executive Council of
the Faculty presented the Presi-
dent’s Committee with not only a
1990-91 total of nine faculty of
color.butalsowithdevelopingplans
forfaculty/studentrecntitmentand
the creation of an executive admin»
istrative position to be held by a
multicultural faculty member, a
suggestion which the Committee
announced last [allt “There has
been a more serious effort toward

{all meeting." he said.

Two African—American faculty
will assume ienuretrack positions
next year: Kia Penso, this year’s
minority scholar~in-residence, will
be added to the English depart-
ment, and George Barlow will be
added to the American Studies and
English departments. Jose Panero
will assume a minority scholar-in-
nesidence position in the biology
department

Drake was not yet ready to re-
lease his plans for faculty/student
recruitment or the creation of the
executive administrative position.
