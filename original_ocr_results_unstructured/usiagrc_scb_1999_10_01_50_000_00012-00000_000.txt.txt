evolurion is a relatively new rheory. It will be a mere 163 years Satur-

in rhe poinr that new species are ereared rhrough narure, and not

But Charles Darwin had discovered evolurion, and was beginning
work on a rrearise rhar would revoiurionize biology.

so why did Kansas decide ro virtually ban teaching mactocvolu»
rion in its public schools? There are rwo possible rheories ro rhc ten-
dering orrhis decision.

The firsr rheory is rhar Kansas is being paid arrby rhe Bush
campaign so rhar rhe counrry’s educarors will turn rheir eyes
from Texas ro anorher srare. For rhe pasr few years, the Lone
srar Srare’s public educarion sysrem has been in shambles. Now
George W Bush, calling himself he “educariau candidare,"
wants ro hide rhe facr rhar under his governorship, Texas has
slipped from 24th [0 «am an rhe Children’s Righrs Council’s
lisr ofhesr srares ro raise children. (Inadentally, Iowa is num—
ber 1,)

orcourse, rhar rheory is neirher grounded in racr nor does
it have one iora of credibility; it was merely an easy jab ar
“Dubbya.” The much more plausible rheory is rhar rhe reli.

broad and generally beyond rhe realm ofcoruplere human com-
prehension, rhe religious righr has somehow been able to nearly
square rhe one or: or rhe orher. The resulr is a roscrcoloted
world view where the Bible is taken as rhe complere truth,
againsr which all science musr be reconciled. If any scienriﬁc

evidence should come ro lighrwhich in any way impinges upon
the realm of the sacred, the former is sacriﬁced on the altar of 1
the latter.

The literal or Divine truth ofthe Bible has been questioned
for rhousands of years, and it is a marrcr {or rheologians to
dcbatc. It is empharically nor a question which can be answered
by acr of governmenr, be ir local, srare, or narional. When rhe
religious righr chooses to imparr irs world view upon rhe ciri.

Perhaps rhe religious right will consider other avenues for
csrablishing a fundamentalist rheacracy in rhe Unired Srares.
Hopefully rhe rree markerplace of ideas will keep American
