Students fear inconvenience

Burling sets new policy

by Stephen Hardwick

The recently introduced policy
at Burling Library that prevents
staff from disclosing the names
of people who have checked our
materials is necessary to protect
the rights of students, said
associate librarian Anne Kintrler.
secretary of the Library and
Bookstore Committee. Many
smdents, however, see the move
as a major inconvenience

The library instituted the
policy after discussions among
the staff and Christopher McKee,
the librarian of the college.
McKee announced the new policy
at a meeting of the Library and
Bookstore Committee, according
to Ken Varnum, a student
member of the committee.

Kintner suggested two
reasons for the change. The ﬁrst
is a general concern for the
privacy rights of library patrons.
In recent years libraries around
the country have placed
increasing emphasis on the
confidentiality of patron records
in response to persistent demands

from law-enforcement agencies,
including the FBI. to examine
library records.

The second reason for the new
policy is a change in Iowa law
which requires that certain public
records remain confidential.
Kintner said that even though it
is unclear if the change applies to
the materials in Burling, “it is a
law and we have to follow the
spirit as well as the letter of the
law." As of yet, no court has
decided the question of whether a
private college falls under this
legal category.

Professor Jack Worley, chair
of the Library and Bookstore
Committee believes that the new
policy would be proper even if
lowa had not changed the law.
“The basic notion here is the
protection of student rights," he
said. He added, “We should not
have to wait for the law to come
crashing down on us before we do

something." Neither Kintner nor
Worley IS aware of any attempt

to obtain a formal opinion from a
college attorney.

Januar 27 1989

Student members of the
committee expressed concerned
about the invconvcnienoc the new
policy may cause. “By and large.
we objected to it." said Vamum.
He said they did not approve of
the policy because of the
difficulty that it imposes on
students who need to obtain
material that is already checked
out. “I didn‘t like it because it
really screws up people," he said.

Vamum said that the library
staff told the students on the
committee that the library would
look for a way to allow students
to waive their privacy rights so
other students could contact
them. Kintner said that there is
no such policy in place, but she
added, “It cenainly would be eas-
ier for us if were able to reveal
the name of the patron and let the
student make private
arrangements as they have done
in the past." She also said that
the library would be willing to
act as mediators between two
patrons if one patron had
materials that the other needed.
