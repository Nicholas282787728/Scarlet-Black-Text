GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

JANUARY 2?. 1943

 

Grinnell Cagers Face Double Bill This Week.

Knox and Ripon
Offer Opposition
In Midwest Tilts

The pressure will be on Grin-
nell’s much belabored cagers
when Knox and Ripon invade
Darby gymnasium on Friday
and Satulday nights lespec~
tively

In an effort to snap the Pion-
eer's six game losing streak, Coach
G. Lester Duke is again juggling
his lineup. He hopes that by in-
serting most of last year's vete-
rans in Friday night's fray, he may
be able to instill a little more
finesse and poise into the scarlet
and black team.

Duke also plans to abandon the
fire-wagon ball which the I’Ioneers
have relied upon to date, and sub-
stitute in its stead the slow, set
style or play which characterized
Grinnell‘s 1942 quintet.

“Except for one game our de-
fense has been adequate," Duke
said, “and letting the boys play
the kind of ball with which they
are familiar, should give us the
added scoring punch we have lack-
ed so far."

In Knox, the Pioneers will meet
a team which is undeieated in con»
ferenoe competition. The Siwash
blasted Ripun 45—40 in their only
Midwest appearance to date.

Knox boasts three veterans from
the team which split even with
Grinnell last year. Olmstead, Le—
mon, and Mason have all return-
ed to bolster the purple and gold
squad.

Schedule Begins
Monday Night

son is definitely scheduled to
start Monday night. However,
rules and regulations for the
tournament have not been form-
ulated and will not be decided
upon until Monday afternoon,
John c. Truesdalc, Intramural di—
rector said yesterday.

The tournament will probably
be round robin, each team play-
ing every other team once during
the season, The intramural
board will meet Monday afternoon
to decide the question of whether
to have two teams represent
each hall or to have only one.

The board will also vote .on
whether to use the full length
court or use the two East—West
courts. thereby making it possi-
ble to hold two contests at once.

ginning chemistry, but approved

lege chemistry completed will
now be permitted, Oelke said.
