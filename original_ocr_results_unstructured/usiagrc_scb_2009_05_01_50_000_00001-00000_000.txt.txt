Controversy
surrounds new
ethanol plant

Zoning issues go to court

BY DAVlD LOGAN

On March 26, an lowa Court of Apr
penis ruled thnr the Poweshrcit county
Bonrd or Supervrsors 11!:th legrlly in to»
zoning land for n proposed ethnnol plant,
paving the way for construction of the
plant just south of Grinuell.

The plant comes from a decrsion in
2006 when the Poweshlek County Board
of Supervisors rezoned 185 acres south of
Grinnell from agricultural to industrial.
This change would allow Big River R:-
sources to build an ethanol pinnr.

The plaintiffs in the case, two couples
who owned property near the proposed

the state’s open meetings laws and that re—

Room draw issues revolve around James

Questions raised regarding the designation ofJames Hall as a substance—free dorm after rooms left empty

5v SARAH BLACK

The recent room-draw uphenvnl cursed by the addition
oflames as a substancerfree dorm for the next year has raised
questions nbout he feasibility ofa substree dorm on south cum-
pus.

Assistant Director of Residence Life Kim Hinds-Brush
said that the demand for subrfree dorms has increased steadily
over the years The upperelass demand has rucrersed,” I’Imdsr
Brush suid We ve always had ﬁrst-year demurrd.

Despite incrcnsing demands for siib- tree housing tomes

Atrnirs hoped for, despite lnmes'lurge rooms and login access.

“We thought rm the second ﬂoor the really big doubles with
loggir nccess would rttrucr upperrclilssmen,"stud Hinds-Brush.
"But they didn't. l was surprised that the triple on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
with its own bathroom went to secondj’cars."

Technical Assistant for Residence Life and Housing Lau-
tn Gogg sniti she was not disnppoinred by the results of the
draw. “With it being the first your, u new year with thnr hull, we
weren't expecting it to go is the most populnr hnll. But it dcﬁr

than we had anticipated."

Beyond James, Gogg wns surprised by the rhree triples lett
rucrnt in smith, which led to on accelerated rush for singles.
“Smith usually goes very enrly in the draw especrnuy the tri-
ples,” said Cogg. “Students thnt had really good room draw
numbers- in subrftee went for singles instcnd ofdlawing those
topics. . .We lrnd all those triples but no one wns set up for u
triple."

in the future cogg hopes to integrttc subrfree rrrplcs into
rhc spceiri housrng selection held weeks before regular roonr
dnuv, in order to fill up room spnce.

Gogg has received four requests for the si. iucnnr doubles

is trying to nceomrnodtte them in order to prevent in all trrste

“l hnverr’t mnde any deﬁnite room chrnges or my cornr-nrte
