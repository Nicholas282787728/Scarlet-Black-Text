Good Old Days Featured Greased
Chapel Aisles, Vegetarian Club

As the days roll
homecoming again blankets a
campus of woe and term papers
with the reminiscences of orgies
and orgies, it is pleasant to think
of the times when college was
college,

That was a time when Victory
Days were pounded out of the
dean of men's chest by the irate
and hysterical drummer; that was
s time of Victory Days. Then,
the surreptitious exists from Mears
were executed from the various
windows, fll'e escapes and holes
in the wall to meet the oh, so
illegal Sunday dates. There was
a day when the freedom of print
was so free that the Dan Morris
oak trees sign was transferred to

People were expelled for mak-
ing noise in the library. (That
was the day when people were in
the library). But it all happened
because the father of one Mears
lovely tied a tin can to the dog's
tail before she whistled him loose.

That was the day of the Vege—
tarian club when hairy-chested
men and pig—tailed girls sat side
by side munching corn with no
fear of the hoary horse meat.
That was a day!

When the grades came out, ev-
en the parents knew what they
meant. Everybody went to the-
Men’s Glee cluh concertithe so—
cial event of the year. The facul-
ty slipped down the greased cha—
pel aisles; the seniors sat in the
front seats. The college shop
poured forth in song.

Then they had “rec" parties:
now they have varsities. Class
iought against class. Iowa Cob
lege beat up on Iowa University,
Every last freshman girl was as-
corted by at least two upperclass
men to the first social event of
the year. That was a day of
upperelass men. ~

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Canning Said to Be
On ‘Stone Crusher’

According to the Grinnell Her-aide
Register, John Canning, Jr., form-
or editor of the Scarlet and Black,
will not return to homecoming
this ysal hccausc he's on the
“stone crushcr".

Further investigation the
story, however. reveals that Can-
ning, now with the puhhc rela-
tions department of the standard
Oil Company, is really accom-
panying Admiral Byrd‘s "snow
cruiser" on its shakedown trip
fxom Chicago to Boston rather
than hchind prison walls.
