Although the score is decisiver
ly in Drake’s tavor the meet was
by no means uninteresting. Close
ﬁnishes occurred in nearly all the
events, the loo. 220, mile, mile bie
cycle, high hurdles and the relay
being especially hair raising. In
the hundred no more than a yard
separated the ﬁrst and the last
men. McIlrath lost the mile run
by less than a yard and Ames's
margin over Grinnell iii the relay
was a matter of inches. Good
time was made in many of the
events considering the day which

record is easily equal to 2.20 on a

a team to Des Moines which will

PRELXMINARY DEBATE.

The preliminary debate or Grin-
nell Institute held last Wednesday
evening was very gratilying to the
societyinsevcralways. Thcnuni-
her or speakers was larger than
usual and shows an increased in-
terest in debating. The fact that
the majority or speakers were new
to society work is well worth men-
tioning. The contest was close, it
being uncertain who were the vic-
tors until after the decision of the
judges. G.O.Arnold,W.A.Har-
lan and 1-1. 1.. James, in the order
named, with D, E. Brundage as
alternate. were the ones selected.

The Stewart library was dedie
cared yesterday and will now be
thrown open tor the use of the
citizens of Grinnell. The event
was a noteworthy one in the his-

The Ceremony of dedication
took place in the Congregational
church in the evening, beginning
at 7:30. The audience which
assembled ﬁlled church, auditor
ium and lecture room to oveirlowe
ing. The exercises were opened
by the rendition of the “March
Militaire" by the Amphion or-
chestra. which was followed by
an invocation by President George
E. McLean. of the State Univer-
sity. Miss Alice 5. Tyler, secre-
tary of the Iowa library commis~
sion, then extended a greeting to
the assembled audience, congrats
ulating the city on the acquir
tion of so valuable an institution
and extoling the spirit which led
to such gitts as that made by the
Hontjoel Stewart and his wife.
The address or the evening was
made by Gov. A. B. Cumnlins,
who touched upon the beneﬁts
conferred by the free libraries of
the country and the aid they be-
stow in educating and up-building
the communities in which they
exist. His address was followed

 

by another selection, "Hungarian
Dance," by the Amphion orches-
trn.

Mr. Stewart being absent irom
the ctty, the keys of the library
were presented to Mayor Spauld-
ing by Mrs. Stewart. His Honor
made a short speech ot accep-
tance and then turned over the
keys to Rev. E. M. Vittum. the
president of the trustees of the
Grinnell lree library. Mr. Vittum
called attention to the fact that
just because the city had acquired
this piece of property, it must not
be concluded that all its wants
were satisﬁed, but stated that a
free club house, a bathing and
swimming pool, a new high school
building and a public hospital are
institutions which would be pro-
ductive of much good. The ins
formation that the netv' owners of
the electric light and heating
plant had given free heat and
light at halt rates to the library,
for twenty-ﬁve years brought
iortli applause.

The audience then joined in
singing "America,” and the dedie
catory services were concluded.

The doors of the library build
ing were thrown open to the pub~
lie and a reception was held until
allate hour, at which the governor
and the visiting commission were
the receiving party. It is sale to
say that over a thousand people
passed before the governor and
inspected the building, which is
most complete in every respect.
