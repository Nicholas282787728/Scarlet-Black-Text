Virginia.

There were several changes

prepare the participants tor the
adventure They were told of the
strict sateiy rules. which in some
cases were even more strict than
those at the iowa Grotto Associa»

risks and made it clear that even
when m the cave. no onc would be
pressured to do anything that he
did not want to do If this meant
that the other seven could not do
something. than so be it Finally.
the leaders warned the par-
ticipants of the possible risks and
required everyone to sign a term

altogether "is a concern on our
trips and is part of our emphasis on
safety.“ says Petty

Goldwater Cave is under the
strict supervision DI the lowa Grot-
tn Association and is Still under ex'
ploration. The explorers from the
Grotto Association know the ex-
plored sections of the cave very
well, No one is allowed to visit the
cave without an expert guide lrom
this group. GORP had two such
guides.

As a former president 01 the
lowa Civil Liberties Union. what is
your opinion on mandatory AIDS
lesling"

John chry '2ll

ldon‘l think that AlDS testing is
at any value. because how oiten
would you tcsl‘Z it you tested today
and i didn't have AIDS. hoiv would
you know i wouldn't have it tuniorr
rou ? So. [don't think it amounts to
much at all. i think education and
precaution and a lot el money
spent on the advancement of cures
ha - a lot more going for it. i think it
is a new and especially dangerous
disease. however. and I'm not sure
we don‘t have to rethink what
we're going to do about it Bul I'm
against attempting to control olher
people's bodies.

Scarlet and Black

since you joined the beard oi
trustees in 1973. have you seen any
major changes in the board‘s goals
tor the college?

John Chrystal

1 think what‘s happened is. as the
endowment grew. the goals of ex-
cellence for the college have risen.
It was an excellent college to begin
with and we've been able to main
tain the disregard of the personal
finances of the students. which is a
marvelous thing. And I think we've ,
kept the goals of a highrquality.
servicerorlented institution ldon't
think the goals have changed so
much as the ability to reach them.
or raise them. has.

John Chrystal “

it isn't just iowa. I think We have
to spend millions at dollars in post-

John Chrystal

lowa's losing population in ace
lual numbers. It does not seem to
me that young people ought to, it
they stay in this state. stay at a
substantial sacriiice in income.
They ought to be able to stay at an
income comparable to what they
could receive elsewhere. They
ought lo be able to stay near their
families or near [he area from
whence they came, and they cans
not do that because there are no
job opportunities. i think there are
ways to make the state more pro-
sperous People oughtn‘t have to
stay here for $3.50 an hour. 'i‘hey

will allow them to own a home.

i think wtiat we've got to do is try
to convince people that you can‘t

can't have yesterday. but you can't
