was small. irondcstript postcrs stuck on loggns a
:ouplc of days before the event, the scars In the
South Lounge of the Forum were filled \vrth stu-
dents and local Gi'inncll residents.

Krrcrrrieh‘s hour-long speech presented his
stance on a wide variety
of issncs, from the CnVl-
ronn-lcnt to the World
Bank to nuclear disarma-

Kuciniclr proposcs strcngthening international
ties, riding on “the ndrancrng tide ofhumnn rrnrty,"
as rvcll as pulling American troops out oflmq and
replacing the troops with troops from the United
Nations.

Kuernrelr's campaign hills him as the most lib.
:ml Democratic candidate in the ﬁeld. ”He's the
only candidate to vote against the war rn Iraq," said
Sharon Gradrehnig, [lie ccntml lowa hold coordi—
nator for the l<rreinreh
campaign. “He's rho
only undidntc who has
a true, one payer. rrnrvcr.
sal health care system.
His stand on the envtr
ronment is also very
strong, which l think
agrees with most stu-
dents."

Kucinich wishts to withdraw from NAFrAand
the World Trade organiaation, and, as Gradiehnig
said, pledges to “divert money from military/spend
ing to a comprehensive education program that
would pay for cduuuon from preschool through
college. Anyone who wants to go to coll:gc and
has the abilitiu to go to college [could] go to colt

Goals like these, popular among liberals, have
convinced some that Kucinich stands to attnrct a
considerable number of voters According to An-
drew Maeoorrald ‘07, leaderorcrinncll’s students
for Kuernreh, “ripeople votedwith their hearts then
l<rrcinich would win the election." However,
