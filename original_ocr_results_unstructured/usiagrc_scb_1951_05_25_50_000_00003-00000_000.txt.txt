Dibble Takes

Tennis Crown

Gl'innell’s game netinen end-
cd their tennis season by plac-
ing second in the Midwest Cone
ference meet at Beloit last Fri~
day and Saturday.

Although Bob Dibble and Joe
Popple placed first and second
respectively in the singles sec-
tion, the Pioneers were edged
out by defending champion Bea
loit, \

Coach' John Pfitsch summed
up the meet by proclaiming,
"we played our finest-tennis of
the year. 1 was very pleased and
proud of our boys. They showed
more'team spirit than any squad
I’ve ever coachedl"

Coach Pfilsch’s only sorrow‘
was the drawing which matched
Beloit's championship doubles
team against the Pioneer duo
of Phil Bennet and Bob Skl‘alna
ka in the first round. The Be-
loit combination beat Grinnelll
6-4, 775. ,

Coach Pfitsch expressed no
doubt that the Pioneers had the
conference’s outstanding squad.
“We beat Beloit badly in a dual
meet, but you Can’t beat Ladyl
Luck.” , . ;

Probably the greatest LT‘lbute‘
that can be paid to a tennis
team’s balanced power was EXA
hibited by Bob Dibble and Joe
Popple who battled for five
hours and fifteen minutes before
Dibble downed his teammate in
five sets. The match was so
close that neither .boy won a
set by more than the minimum
two-game edge,

nificent.
