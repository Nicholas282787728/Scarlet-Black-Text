Faculty Follies Opens with Corny
Jam Session; Keeps Up Pace

By John Marion.

For sweet charity’s sake We paid
35 Cents to see the “Faculty F 1-
lies of 1939.” It was Worth it, if
only to boo the faculty, to laugh
at them, and to be REALLY en-
tertained.

The mammoth production got
under way with an overture by
an all—faculty orchestra that

sounded like the orchestras which '

are heard in second-rate heer
joints at 2 a. m. Sunday moi-rt
ings. A. ballet was the first act
and nearly stopped the show be—
fore it was really under way.

The information please act
wasn't quite as funny as anticis
pated, mainly because the faculty
failed to answer most of the ques
tions, and the inquiring reporter
failed to call their mistakes.
George Seiver showed he is the
only one who reads the funnies
by answering all the comic strip
questions.

Perhaps the funniest part of the
whole show was the faculty inter-
pretation oi Grinnell student life.
Freddy Baumann was exceptionals
ly effective as a prep who took
snapshots in class and “necked"
on A. R. H. steps. Georgie Seiver
and E. B. T. Spencer. as two
Honor “G" men, proved they no-
tice more than we suspect them
of.

The opera that concluded the
show was quite self explanatory:
the actors sang, “something
smells,” they were right. the
smell was the singing of the
male lead in the opera, Herschel
M. Colbert.

Senior Cut Warning
Issued by Registrar

All seniors who are so registered
that they will have exactly 120
hours of credit upon graduation
are reminded by the registrar
this week that they will be held
responsible for the number of class
absences they take.

If they exceed 14 cuts they will
lose one hour's credit toward
graduation, which will mean they
are ineligible.

 

A full house was present and
Comments were, “It should be
made an annual affair

Tickets for the final perform-
zmce will be on sale only at the
door tonight.
