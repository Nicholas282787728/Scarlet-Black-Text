illsti-ated the high place Grimtell holds
among people not personally interested
in the College, in the chapel lzrlk )‘cs-
tel-day morning.

”I met a man who had no pe ouai
connection with tirinneli College.“ ml
.\lr.l\'ol)1e, “but when i told him i w s
trorn Griniieil, he said, "rite thing i
have noticed about (ii-inneli men in
this community is the strong charac-
(er they possess!

“But the question now raised," point-
ed out the speaker. is, "is Grinnell
doing it now? If so, it depends upon
the iiiiinenee the faculty exerts over
the students and that w iieh each stur
dent exerts over his or her associates.

“We are not alone ioriniiig our eli‘a

teeter," said Protessor ‘ohlc, put ainr

all of us to try to help others term
