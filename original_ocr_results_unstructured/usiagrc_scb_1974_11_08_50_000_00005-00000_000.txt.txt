Current lsraeli literature, like its
counterpart in the other middle
eastern countries. Africa and
much of Asia, is relatively
unknown. In fact. one would be
hard pressed to name a major
writer from each of these areas.

Recently, though, this trend is
beginning to change. Due to
cultural exchanges, ethnic ins
terests, and ior many, a desire to
merely experience literature
beyond the realm of their normal
association, many heretofore
unknown writers are appearing on
the bookshelves. One of these
emerging literatures, with an
evolving technique and style oi its
own, a development akin to that oi
the other areas noted above, is the
new Israeli work, being written
originally in a recently
resuscitated Hebrew language,
and now beginning to appear in
translation.

Israeli literature I5 quite unlike
the European prototype From
which it emerges. Retaining many
elements of Russian and German
literature, and of course Yiddish
culture, the new writing in lsreal
rcilects this past.asitisnow being
Subjected to the present. and as the
present exists alone, as it much
exist without being totally
heholden to the past.

rirsuruits is an anthology at this
contemporary literature. As the
predominant style oi Hebrew
letters is now the short story, the
anthology deals exclusively with
that iorm. The short story as a
form [its well with the new “style”
of Israeli letters. Marty at the
writers in this anthology shy away
irom an expansive novelistic
analysis oi the current Israeli
situation, preterriiig to deal with
aspects oi the whole.

It is precisely by hitting the
points of discussion head on,
brieﬂy and tersely, yet creatively,
that the new Israeli author goes

straight to both the heart and
mind, in a manner rarely en
countered previously. Many oi the
stories, though at times cold and
blunt in either their accusations or
exhortatioiis. give the reader an
unparalleled sense of immediacy,
the reader is thrust not only into an
autltors’ world, but also and more
importantly, into the world that
these people are writing about, one
whose dangers and current
situation can only be satisfac-
torinlly portrayed in prose that
brings the reader as close to that
experience as possible. ‘And the
beauty oi seeing a new literature
emerge is a rarely granted
privilege

When discussing any literature
that appears in translation, the
problems oi the respective trane
slations always rind their way to

translations will in no way improve
them as they stand in the an»
thology. but With a renewed in-
terest in the literature 01 non

demand for new and better Iran-
slations should manifest ltsell, And
so hopefully some oi the stories in
this anthology will he done justice,
0n the whole the translations are
as acceptable as can he expected,
nehrcw not being a European
language, thus complicating the
already diiiicult processes oi
tra lation.
