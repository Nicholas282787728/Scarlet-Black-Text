sophistication Bond said, “it was an
awlul mistake to support Jimmy Carter
. . . because we took him on faith and
this is bad, in my View, to take a politir
cian on faith.”

Bond’s statements on the need for
economic sophistication and interna»
tional involvement specitically tor
blacks also have special meaning for
college students. As Bond said, “Some
of these young people here who may be
poll-sci majors or whatever need to go
into computer technology or some new
careers of the future instead of sticking

to the old careers of yesterday, some of g

which may be good and they may find a
job at it, but I think they need to be a lit-
tle bit more adventurous in their View
oi what they could be doing in or 20
years from now and I think that's true
of black people generally.”

Questioned about his views on college
divestiture of funds in South African
companies, Bond said he thought that
action would be "extremely helpful“
because colleges should provide an ex-
ample for international racial progress.
During the reception at the Black
Cultural Center, Bond signed a petition
for the divestiture of Grinnell's funds in
South Africa, The senator explained,
"Because we have been the Victims of
discrimination and prejudice we ought
to constantly fight against it when we
see it directed at any other people but
particularly it they are our own people.
I feel a tie there. I feel a relationship

yselt and I think all of us should."

As DuBois exhorted blacks to study
heir own history in the early 19005, so
oday does Bond stress the need for a
trong cultural identity and the value of
‘.lack institutions. One example of a

eful black institution is Spelrnan Col-
ege, with which Grinnell has planned
: n exchange, The functions of all black

olleges, according to Band, are that
hey “give black students an opportuni-
y to attend to school and their
.cademic subjects in an atmosphere
here they are tree trorn any kind of
acial worries , . . . It gives the black
tudent who may not have the oppor-
unity to become student body presi-
- ent if he or she were a student at Grin-
ell the chance to do that . . . to he presi-
rent of the French Club or to do one of

e many other things that students do
n addition to being students.”

But Bond felt that black cultural
paratism does not have to be total
nd can serve an important purpose at
olleges such as Grinnell, Using the
slack Cultural Center as an instance of
his separatism, Bond said, “One at the
esults Iol' separatism] is this house in
.1 )0, Wet

which we sit. This college, I doubt,
would have had this house 10 years ago.
though it might have, I think the results
ot this kind of voluntary political
separatism as opposed to legally sauce
tioned and enforced separatism have
generally been positive; that they have
enabled the black people who find
themselves an identifiable minority in a
world which is not always hospitable to
them to develop political strengths and
some cultural notion of who we are,
where we are coming from and what we
have to do to go where we want."

However, he continued, “I think it is a
danger if a house like this one becomes
an absolute refuge from the general col-
lege population. Then 1 think it’s a
danger. a detriment." Bond said that
organizations such as the Concerned
Black Students and the sense of volunv
tary separatism ought to be used in a
positive way. He noted, though, the
harmful effects of the voluntary isola-
tion of blacks on some college cam-
puses. Bond concluded. ”when I'm
espousing this kind of voluntary
separatism. I‘m not suggesting that
minority or black students ought to ab-
solutely shut themselves away and lead
a cloistered existence. I think that from

For non~black students at Grinnell,
Band offers specific suggestions on the
question of race. One can obtain a as
membership to the NAACP but this is
not enough. He explained, ”You need to
do much more than that . . . . One thing
you can do is to talk to those [black]
students What kind of problems do
they have? Some of the problems they
may have I would imagine are not as
real as they think they are but they are
problems of their perception of their
fellow students and administrators and
so on because they would tend to
develop some paranoia being here, I
would guess."

He also suggested students could
work with blacks in their hometowns,
using their talents for the organiza-
tions beneilt as well as thelrown Bond
stressed that whites can and should
have unlimited participation in black
organizations but “he or she always
ought to be conscious if one of the aims
is to provide opportunities for black
people then dont stand in the way,
don t become a part of what you re try-
ing to fight against. ”

Commenting on what still needs to be
done in the black movement, Bond
reviewed DuBois’ precepts once again.
But he concluded more simply. “We

separatism comes the strength to enter
into the larger academic community
and the larger world beyond that. If it
becomes the opposite. then it's a
hinderance rather than a help "

Bond said that while blacks must
reach out to me larger campus com»
munity, he thinks it “is always a two-
way street. It shouldn‘t just be one
group reaching out saying 'come to
me} It ought to be a mutual process. I
learn about you, you learn about me,"

If

need to do the things that a citizen does,
What does a Citizen do? He doesn't just
do his job and come home and play with
the kids. Or she doesn't just get up and
go to her job and come home and do
whatever she does. But you would think
that people have some interest in the
world around them, whether that is the
block or the city or the state, the own
try or the world . , . . What we need to
do, we collectively, is to be good
citizens.”
