Through an abandoned mine runs this giant
wheelbarrow carrying nine thousand tons ,
of coal per day in a steady stream from the

more effort or concern than pressing a
switch button. Electricity pushes it.

elevators, stackers, locomotives, and other
material-handling equipment have gained
ﬂexibility, dependability, and ease of control
through electric motorization.
