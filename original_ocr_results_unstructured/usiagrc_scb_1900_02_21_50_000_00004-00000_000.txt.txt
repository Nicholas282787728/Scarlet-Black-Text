Sophomoressenior Reception.
Last Saturday evening ushered

in one of the pleasantest parties.

which has been given this school
year, the occasion being the an
nnal reception tendered by the
Sophomore to the Senior class,
The evening’s entertainment hes
gain in the Cltresto Hall,,tvhere
the senior was kept busy endeav-
oring to select, for the events
wllich were to follow, the most

. charming Sophomore girl, and the

sophomore was somewhat simi-
larly engaged striving to gain as
a partner in some event the Senior
lady whom he most ardently ads
mired. In order to allay the con
itision this caused, Miss Millard
favored the two classes with a
piano solo; atier- which the fess

policeman and drum-major, which
led the way below to the chapel
or fair grounds proper. Herc,
just upon entering, were to be
found “nigger babies,” which
caused the hearts of all socialists
present to grow numb with dis-
couragement, after once seeing
the competition awakened among
the guests in their strife for candy
pipes. Following came the pea-
nut roaster, with a goodly qttanti»
ty of fresh roasted peanuts at
nothing a sack. The candy cane
rack was also close at hand.

At no time in the evening did
the patronage of the merry go
round wane. Here the gentlemen
might have a tree ride if they
could induce the ladies to furnish
motive power.

During different intervals of the
evening music was turnisiied by
Miss Bousquet, '01, Mr. Delavan,
’0t, and Miss Williams, '02,

 

The pop earn and red lemonade
stand was always in evidence, and
the liquid furnished was better

To the guests of thC evening
the SldC show was especially pops
ular. It consisted oia telescope
directed upon an electric light in
order to make the scene which
was to be Viewed upon the exteiis
or lens more marked. The scene
displayed was of a nature to recall
vividly to the Seniril's mind the
recent pleasure excursion of the
class in the direction of Scat'sboro.

Toward the latter part of tlic
evening ice cream and cake was
served by the Misses Tone and
Gifford.

In every detail the part\' was a
great success; and the efforts at
the social committee were partly
