Review: Folksy
sweetness at
Bob’s on Wed.

This past Wednesday Nov. 7, at Bob's, Alela Diane pres
vldcd music to tap your foot to: one or two women, one guitar
and a lamp on a stool for mood lighting.

She and her traveling companion and opener, Alena Hatdr
ing, played simple folk songs, with soft finger picking accomr
paniment on the guitar and delicate harmonizing from both
women on some songs. ltwas pretty all the time, even more so
because of a few ﬂubs and an impromptu cover of an old folk
song, which they “learned five minutes before sound check.”

Diane’s voice easily can be (and has been) compared to
Dusty Springﬁeld or cat Power, and she certainly shares voice
qualities with those women. Her voice was earthy and natural,
with a hint of twang. Harding's was a bit more breathy and
ephemeral. They played 10 songs in about 45 minutes, and it
felt like art appropriate amount.

Their banter and personalities were stereotypically indict
cute. Diane described their cross»country trip as just two wome
on driving and singing along to an iPodTheit camaraderie was
unforced and easy, though they took their mistakes seriously
and apologized for them. In fact, Harding seemed a bit nervous
{or playing in such an environment. But it wasn't a sloppy per»
formance in any sense.

The cover of the old folk song (which had something to
do with the narrator wanting to stay friends even though they
were not lovers) seemed very similar to the rest of their work
and showed the debt that Diiine had to such “oldrschool” foil;1
in her words. In the “indiCrfolk” genre, whore Diane has been
placed, whatever was good in the '60s seems to reappear for a
new genemtion, not so much changed as just revisited from a
new perspective.

Tire narrative in Diane's songs stand up, and the yodeling in
“The Riﬂe," offofher new album, wztsjust sweet. 50 even ifshe
has to talk and play in the some stilted way that the old folk-
ics did, With nictiiphors ofmountalns and oceans and ominous
narratives about needing rifles in the forest with less-rthanromir
nous guitar accompaniment, her professionalism and voice car-

ries some interest for today’s audience.

Terry's lyrics offer an odd

may sound fun to dance to,
he is often singing of heart-
