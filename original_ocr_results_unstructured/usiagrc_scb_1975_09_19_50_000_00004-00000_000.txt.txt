Letter fro
the editors

Frankly, we are amazed, chagrined, horrified. The liveliest,
and most widely read section of the paper (next to the
personals in the want ads) has all but disappeared.

The letters to the editor, those basic little scribbles we find
dumped in the want ad box or under the office door, are the
most important indicators of public opinion to be found in
any publication, The letters are primary expressions of
outrage, praise, evangelism, cynicism, et’al. Wild letter
debates arising at the slightest provocation, are the most
entertaining, human pieces a newspaper can print.
(Remember Ira Aronin, seniors?)

So, what's wrong? Is campus really so dull that the best
one can do for social commentary is bash his or her head
against central campus sculpture during a Frisbee tour-
nament? If things are this bad we might just end up T.P.-ing
Turner's house.

For one, the S&B can be absolved of any blameiin this
particular situation, at least. We want your letters! They are
the lifeblood of any publication dedicated to thoughful
representation of community opinion

You can read the editorials, you can read the columnists,
but if you want to read yourself, send a letter through the
,campus mail, drop it off at the office (Forum basement) or (if
you must] stuff it into the want ad box. If we get it before

5:00 on Tuesday, you're in.

Women outline goals

-To the Editor:

The Women’s Group of Grinnell
College seeks to develop and
maintain a supportive, woman-
cenLered community which
respects the individual (inferences
in lifestyles and experience of the
women involved This community
will include students, faculty, and
staff in the hope that we can teach
and learn from one another's
experiences. The Women‘s Group

'views individual and group growth

as coming out of ﬁne interaction of
different perspectives. The group
therefore wants to especially
encourage those who have never
participated in women’s groups
before to come and share their
observations and experiences,
The Women‘s Group has a
commitment to foster a sense of
joy and celebration in being
women together. To this end, the
Women’s Center in Smith Annex
113 will be more than simply a
place io meet for discussion
groups. We hope to make it a place
where women can go to just relax,
read, have a cup of coffee, andor
just talk, We are also developing a
collection of Women’s books,
magazines, and newsletters which
will be available in the Center,
The organization of the Women’s

. Group is based on ihe commiimenl

that the group will be a selfr
renewing one. This requires lhai
the organization constantly en-
courage new women to take active
roles in the group. There is a
steering committee, the mem-
bership of which is open to any
woman who wishes to parlicipaii

nl s In

in the over-all decisionrmaking oi
the group. This committee meets
regularly on alternating Mondays.
Existing alongside the steering
commiiiec, various “project
groups" such as Women’s Studies,
Women’s Health Care, Con-
sciousness-Raising, etc., will
provide an opportunity for women
with more specific interests to
