The Grinnell Pioneers drupped
their Parents’ Day football contest
7-2 to the Beloit Buccaneers in
Midwest Conference Blue Division
action last weekend.

The Pioneer offense managed to
put together a mere 76 rushing
yards and 73 yards passing The
longest play from scrimmage was
a 4l»yard pass from Don Petrich to
Kevin Oakes.

Defensively. the Pioneers played
very strongly. forcing the Bucs to
surrender the ball twice. once on
the Grinnell ten»yard line. and
again on the Grinnell Six.

Beloit's only score came late in
the first half when they returned a
blocked punt 31 yards for a touch-
down.

Aftcr thc disappointing dcfcal
Coach Bowers commented,
“Bcloit was a lnuch improved ball
club They're like us. they don't
havc the personnel needed for a
good offe s it's just that our
offense \v 1 little weaker."

After [he defense forced a safety.
Gi‘innell's offense had a chance to
score but their drive {altered with
a Iourth and two on the Rue len~
yard line,

”The right play was called."
Bowers said “It's just that it was
poorly executed. We had fine

third straight

defensive hitting. it’s just that our
offense did not execute the plays
when they had to."

The Pioneers will take their one
and three record into the final nonr
conference game of the season
when they meet St. Ambrose t2»2)
tomorrow on Rosenbloom Field at
1:30

women are improving with each

a good race and highly com-
petitive. i expected more runneis
but the runners that were there
. were really good fora small field. I
thought we did really well as a
team in the cold and windy
weather,”

tight; Wesleyan won 154, its and
1540.

On Monday. October 10. Cornell
beat the Pioneers. The Scores of
the fivergame match were 8-15. 4-

game. Elizabeth Jurkiewicz suf-
fered an injured knee and
Elizabeth Valenti was taken out
with an injured ankle.

After Tuesday night's game.
sophomore Rosemary Strunk
commented. “We had to play three
junior varsity and five varisty
games with ten players. which
meant only three of our varsity
players started fresh. The two
injuries we suffered in that game
did not help much either. However,
the girls who were called in as
replacements picked up the slack

’well. I thought we played one of our
best games yet."

home game tomorrowat the PEG
against Central College. The team
will play at the PEG one more time
this year during the district
tournament on October 28.
