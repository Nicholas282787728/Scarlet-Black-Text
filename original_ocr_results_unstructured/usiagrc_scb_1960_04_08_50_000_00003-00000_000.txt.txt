Some of the bcxt ﬁllings comet
in small packages, or so it
would seem to look behind the
doors of the little building
which sits iiicoiispieuously. bee
tween ARH and the old Car»
negie library and houses "the
voice and choice of Grinnell
college.” radio station KGRW. ‘

In this case looks can cer» t
tainly be deceiving inside the 3
ﬂwm'frsizetl building, the l
tioii boasts two studios for
live broadcasting, a control
room complete with the must i
intricate network oi maclr
inery and controls, a record l
library oi over 3,000 records
and perhaps its proudest pos-
session, acoording to Gene
Shepard. station manager,
“something iew college.mdio

Now maintained and serviced
by John Kennedy, chiet angle

completely designed by Clyde
Combs, a former Griniiell KG
man, and all the other equip
ment the station uses was built
by lormer and present chief
engineers and their staffs,

Dick Scott, engineer for
three years preceding Kene

new control board. To the lays
man even n gl pse oi all the
machinery, liglits, switches
and buttons makes him look
at KG, its stall and hackers
with more and more respect.

 

“Because of the very nature
of our' transmission system,”
said Shcp‘ "two broadcast
frequencies are desirable and
used. On north campus KGRW
can be heard on 610 and on
south campus on 685. This is
also in compliance with article
15 of the FFC rules and reg-
ulatious Our covCragc,” con-
tinued the station manager,
”also under FCC art 15) is re-
strieted to the Grinnell campus
area. Transmission is by car-
rier current, which means that
the signal lroni our two trans-
mitters lone north. one south

essentially tor an antenna.”
