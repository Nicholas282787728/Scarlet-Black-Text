Editor Scarlet and Black:

So much has been said regarding the
present football-soccer agitation by
everyone, whether familiar or not with
the game, that l have hesitated to re-
ply to your request for a statement of
my views. Thorn, too, in a brief iu'tir
cle it is impossible to give any compre»
hensive statement of the reasons for
one‘s convictions. i shall try to avoid
points that have been dealt witll in
previous articles.

My sympatlly is not with those who
express wholesale condemnation of the
present game, only those who have
never played the game can do this. I
would be in favor of retaining foothall
if better games cannot be substituted.
We have all been simply taking it for
granted that there could be no other
good fall game. Altllo l anl glad we
have Iidil the game, i think the time
has conic to drop it cillirely and t i
other games. The purpose oi the same
has been entirely luisdiicrted tlic lasli
few years.

of high quality. in football many men
learn for tile first time what it means
to lose themselves in a cause not whole
ly their own. it would he hard to over-
estimate the value of this to many men
(a) It has often been instrumental ill
interesting some‘men in~tlle lite and
purpose of their institutions who other
wise would have drifted into 3, worth-
less career for themselves and their
college. (4) it relieves many men
of an over supply of self conceit, while
on the other hand it has given to main-
a wholesome self conﬁdence that has
'pl'oven highly valuable iii other activis
ties.

Football has attracted large crow (is
(but only to championship games,»
largely because (1) The game is a ser-
ies of climaxes, every down is in a
sense a touch down. Tile intcrest is
continuous. (2) The element of films
ger and daring is always contagious
and invariably urges some players on
to brilliant and spectacular playing.
(3) it. has furnished a splendid oppol»
tunity for the expression of college
unity, otherwise known as college
spirit. Final action against football
needs to take into account the part
football plays in furnishing an outlet
for that wholesome expression of coir
lege enthusiasm. My contention would
he that there are other adequate ways
of developing college spirit, even on the
athletic ﬁeld and that several consider
ntions against the game outweigh this
in favor of it,

On the other hand, football must not
be retained because it has drawn large
crowds, in fact from the point of view
of advantage to the player this is a cow
vinclng reason for abolishing it. Nor
.can it Do retained on the gronrfd that
it develops speed, accuracy, and self-
control. I do not think it compares
favorably even with tennis in this re-
spect. The opportunity to obtain ends
by brilliant and spectacular play less
sens the respect for work accomplished
by steady and united ettort.

The ﬁve numbers which constituted

was an uilrtordnLe improvement on
Shakespeare’s Didrtime favorite. it

The soccer game of football which
has been .ldlocated by the Scarlet and
Black the past few months will be
givell a thoro trial next fall. A nllmf
her of the friends of the garlic are
going to put up a trophy to bo cou-
tested ior by teams representing the
Freshmen and Sophomore classes. For
a period of two or three years, the
rulllpetitiou will be limited but later ii‘
deemed adv ~aiilc the competition will
betilrown open to teams representing
all the classes of the college.

As the plans for this game have been
tentatively developed there will be a
series of three games between the two
under classes each fall at a time to be
determined by the Iowa College Athr
Ietic Association, the only condi-
tion being that they come before the
Thanksgiving vacation, The winner
of two of these three games will have
possession of the trophy for the year,
The games will be played according to
the rules 0! the soccer game. These
will be held under the management of
the Athletic Association which has
charge of all interclass activities

That this game will do much toward
securing a more general competition
of the men of the college in some sport
during the [all months is conﬁdently
believed by the friends 0! the sport.

The council passed a resolution to
the effect that in the futllre no coir
lege organization should charge more
than seventy-ﬁve cents admision to any
college function without the consent of
the council. This applies to the Glee
mill) concerts. the class society and
dramatic cillh plays and all other
events in which students vei gener
ally participate. This action was ta-
ken with the idea of keeping all these
different activities essentially college
innctiolls within the reach of everl'
member of the college community as
in that fact lies lilllcll of their interest
and value.

The council also recommended that
President Main be requested to take
up the question of the adiuissloli to the
vice ciuh concert to be given this year
and see if it would be practical to ef-
fect a reduction to the old scale of pri-
tcs at this time.

PROF. COXARD IN EAs’T.

Professor H. S. Collard will he in
stl-llctor in Plantecoiogy during the
summer term at the Marine Biological
Laboratory of the Brooklyn Institute of
Arts and sciences at Cold Spring Hal"
bor, New York. Dr. Schilll, who lec~
tllred here this winter, is from this in-
sfitution. Professor Conard is the
only Western professor on the board
of instruction and this fact speaks for
his reputation and worth in this work.

that after two or three years and the
acquirement of the necessary skill to
play the game successfully it will be
come of general college interest. At
any rate, it will be a form of inter-
clnss activity that will tend to further
develop the splendid system that is al-
ready existant In Grinnell and will

For those who are capable of enjoy-
ing a progralil or serious music, the
\lcsper Choir concert givcn last even-
ing “as one of the most satisfactory
musical events of the year. In poilit
of evceliencc of rendition and quality
of music, it ranks easily among the
best student concerts ever given in
Grinncll.

Plans were changed somewhat, alter
the publication of last week's Scarlet
and Black, and it was decided to give
an entirely sacred concert.

of the numbers given the Bach and
Tschaikowsky numbers deserve special
mention. They are, each in its own
way, as difficult sacred compositions
as have been written and the choir
showed itself fully capable of Tendel‘r
ing them artistically. The beauty of
the other numbers, particularly the
Sancflls, is too well known to need any
comment.

The solo numbers consisted of “But
the Lord is lllndlul of His Own," hy
Mendelssohn, by J'ss tiarris:

The board of athletic control of the
college is busily making plans for
pushing ahead the work on the big
cement grand stand which is to rise on
Ward Field this spring. The need of
haste is especially evident when it is
considered that if present plans are
carried ollt a hero meet to which all
the colleges ot the state will be invited
to send athletes will he held in Grin
nell on May 21, The board is in active
correspondence with architects and
contractors and hopes to be able to
open the bids and let the contract
about the twelfth of this month. Therer
after, work will start just as soon as
the frost is out of the grounl.

it is not proposed to build all of the
mammoth grandstand at this time, the
plan being to erect a structure afford-
ing about 1,300 seats. A great effort
will be made to get a large proportion
of these in shape by the time of the
proposed meet.

The grandstand was made possible
by contributions from friends of the
college and from last year‘s graduating
class. It will he one of the biggest im-
provements ever seen on the campus
when completed and will do much in
making Grinnell a center for athletic
events of every description
