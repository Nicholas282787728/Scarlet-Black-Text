by Miss Evelyn Gardner, dean of
womcn, will be kept in her office for
nor pcrsonol use and will he avail-
able to the women in the quadrangle

It is to be col'npiled from the in-
formation obtained by secretaries of
the different organizations on the
campus and is for the purpose of as—
certaining participation of women in
college organizations and extracur-
i ricular activities.

in a case of a woman holding too
many offices or undertaking too much
work, the individual will be relieved
of some of these activities. according
to Miss Gardner, while on the other
hand, the woman who is taking no
part in college activities will undoubt-
edly be asked to do so,

It will also be of use to Miss Gard-
ner in giving requested recommenda-
tions for graduates, she asserted.

The list is almost complete and will
be available in Miss Gardner's office
some time this week.

Pioneers Seek

Revenge Over
Ancient Rivals

Bulldogs
Squad Saturday Before

Oppose G'rinnell

Homecomers

Eucalﬁ‘agcd by ztn impressive Show”
ing against the Haskell Indians last
week, the Grinnell football team is
working with increased interest this
week, preparing for the Drake con-
test. which wlll be the feature on the
Homccoming program here Saturday
afternoon.

The Pioneers have a season record
of seven defects and one tie game.
but despite this are optimistic about
the second tussle with Coach Vee
Green's Bulldogs. In the first game
between the two teams, played early
in the season, the university crew
downed the Fionccrs 13 to 0. .

Shows improvement

Since that time, with the exception
of the Carleton game. the Grinnell
team has shown decided improve-
ment, and with a few shakeups in
the lineup, will he expected to give
the erstwhile conference leaders some
stiff competition.

Last week the Drake title hopes
were blasted by the powerful Okla-
homa Aggies eleven to the tune of
21 to n. This made the second game
in a row that the Bulldogs have lost,
being defeated by Temple university
in an intersectional game on the
previous week, 20 to 14.

Green Gives Men Rest

Monday Coach Green gave his lads
a rest, and reports from the Bulldog
camp stated that the team would not
be given a heavy workout until to-
night, Several of the men were badly
bruised in the game with the Cow-
boys. Al Wieland, 190 pound halfback,
whu‘hss led the Missouri Valley scor-
ers all season, and who was recently
demoted to the third string, was
quickly advanced to the varsity in
time for the Oklahoma scrap, and
will be in shape for the Grinnell
game.

Captain Brechler, 182 pound left
guard, leads a heavy line, which is
especially well trained on defensive,
helped especially by Cole, a 215 pound
tackle. The Drake players have been
outstanding on defense this season.-
The last time the pioneers met them
they found it hard to penetrate the
center of the line, finding it neces-
sary to shirt the ends and flank the
tackles.
Bulldogs Take to Air

In the game at Des Moines the
Bulldogs were prepared for a fast
aerial attack on the part of the Crin-
nell team, but when the games pres
gressed they proved to be the aerial
minded team of the two, putting
themselves in position with passes for
both of their touchdowns.

Coach Lester Watt sent his men
through a scrimmage against the
