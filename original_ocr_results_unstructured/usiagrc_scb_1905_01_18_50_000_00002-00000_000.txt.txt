HE return or the basket ball
season has brought with it to
the minds oia good many Iowa Collcge
students one or the reatures ’oIlltst
year’s home games whichmade allcon-
tests liere doubly interesting. The
John P. Watson band had a short
career but it holds a place in the
hearts or the people which is large out
of all proportion to its period ofex-
istenoe. Indications at present are
that opportunities to do good work
will be as plenty as in any previous
year. Certainly there will be no lack
of appreciation should the band- be
reorganized. Let us hope thati ill
soon make an appearance.

a year or more has passed since the
agitation was started in the dc-
bating union in fdl‘or or establishing
an honor design to be worn by mem-
bers oi the inter-collegiate debating
teams Scanner .tsti BLACK is pleas-
ed to note that the worthy movement
has at last borne fruit and that. mem-
bers of the team that debated last
year against Cornell are now wearing

.a neat 0 design whcrcnn the words,
“Honor Debating" are inscribed. A
moderators gavel is inserted in the
G vertically The whole is a thing ct
beauty without considering its deep
signiﬁcance and would do credit to
the taste or any connoisseur merely as
an ornaiu'cnt. it is understood that
members oicolleue team or 10: will
