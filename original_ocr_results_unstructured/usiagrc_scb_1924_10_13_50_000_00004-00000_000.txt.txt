I Preps Take Up
Midnight Golf

A sinister atmosphere pervaded tlio
dormitories just after twelve o'clock
Saturday night, when certain lndivulr
nails were seen hiking bacli and forth
, between buildings, carrying arm-lands
, or sniuli sticks. At twelve-thirty the
order name;

"All Preps out!” And drowsily. in
spite of the racket and the tllumlerousi
voices of their superiors, iiajamased

building they were lined up and then
marched, amid a great calm, to the
third tee on the Country Club golf
course.

Ceremonies were in charge or Rup-
ert Hawk, '24. There was little noise
any no gaycty as he spoke, laying con-
siderahle emphasis onhard work and
loyalty. The Gi-irrhell vow of alleg
lance was read and administered

“Now,” concluded Hawk, "we have
always deemed it ﬁtting and proper
to ﬁnish each initiation with a little
gentle fun.” Juniors and seniors
formed a double gauntlet through
which the props ran at full speed. The
' line was nearly a block long, and each
upperciassman, the preps declare,
“wielded a wicked paddle.”
