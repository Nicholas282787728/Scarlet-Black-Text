Council Protests New Registration Policy

Registration Plans for Year l957—58 Action Sough+
Include Three important Innovations.

By Hank Abbott

Several changes have been made in :the registration
plans for the academic year 1957-58 that will have a major
effect upon stlltlents’ registering on May 1417 for next year,

The first major change requires that registration be
lnatle on a year basis instead of by the semester. This change

Oaks confel'cncc,ithe first Unit-
cd Nations Gcneral Assembly
and the Paris Peace conference.

He became ambassador to
Saudi Arabia and minister to
Yemen in 1950. Two years
alter he was promoted to the
. rank of career minister.

In 1053 Hare was appointed'

ambassador to Lebanon and a

year later became director gen-‘

eral of the foreign service. He
held that post. until August 30.
1956 when he was appointed

ambassadoi to Egypt by Presi»

demand more longsrdnge
planning from the student and
will require a more careful
consideration or his graduation
requirements and general held
of interest.

Register for Course Only

The second and most contro—
versial change planned by the
administration deals with those
courses which have more than
one section each semester. The
student will register for the
course only, and the section and
group assignment will be made
by the registrar during the sum.
mer.

The obvious disadvantage to

, the student is that he will be

unable to choose either the
professor he wants or the time
he wishes to take the course.
What docs the administration
and registrar‘s office hope to
gain by this change? It would
eliminate the possibility of
closed sections and also make
the sections more evenly dis~
triliuteil. However, this inter»
ierencc with the past l)reogil~
tive of the student in choos-
ing his own instructor for
multi-section classes is certain
to meet with disapproval iii
the student body,

Efficient Card System
Finally, a new card system
will be inaugurated next rear,
which should eliminate repctr
tious lot-ins, save standing in
line, and assure prompt grade
reports. Certainly sttidcnts will
be pleased with such effects

coming from the card system.
Givens L. Thornton. rcgis—_
trar, said that this year—long
registration plan is on an ex-
perimental basis, and that if
it proves- inconvenient, the
college will return to the old
system. In rcicrriiig to the as:
signmeiit oi class sections by
the registrar, Thornton said
that such a change had the
full support of the President
and the Executive coun .

He also said that the new
plan oi having upperclassmen
pr .i-egister tor the entire year,
and having freshmen register by
mail in the slimmer, is unusual
among colleges and universities,

 

wilh GI‘lnnell being among the-

vel‘y few using such a plan.

In Discussion

With Norton

By Tom Skornin
By a ringing voice vote the

. Student Council in its regular

Wednesday session passed
unanimously :1 resolution “em-

. powering the president of Stu-

dent Council to take any and
all measurcs to prevent the
execution oi the administra—
tion's new registration policy
involving multissection classes."

giruuanimous amendment to
the motion turther “empowered
the president to call special
emergency sessions of thc couns
cil at any time hetero Wednes—
day to deal with developnien s."

_The action came as a direct
result of the announcement
that all multissection courses
would be 'nssignerl to students
during the summer without
the individual student having
a choice as to professor or
hour of chiss. Further height.
ening .the apprehension ot
many students was the alleged
remark of one administrative

. otticial. that ”,four_years from

now the students will never

remember that they had a
choice."

A meeting between Dean R.
Homer Norton and .M. E, Han»
nah, League Board presiden-
Jim Hautzingci, c of HP pres
dent,
president, was scheduled for 10

   

a..,m yesterday to express the
sense or the Student Council
and student body against the

proposed change, At this meet
ing the various merits of the
new plan were outlined by her-
ton and Givens L. Thornton,
registrar,

it was felt, said Thornton,

that students would beneﬁt by'

elimination of lines and closed.
out courses at rc‘gistration, and
that faculty would beneﬁt by
better balanced classes, It was
admitted, however, that aside
from faculty representatives on
the Executive Council of the
college no iaculty members had
been consulted in regard to the
change. It had become evident
on Wednesday that a. number of
faculty members would be ap-
posed to the change,

lIautzinger stated that the
c of HP felt that the new
move worked to vitiote the
liberal arts principle of high-
ly personalized studentsiaculs
ty relations, and that his or-
ganisation was thereiore un—
alterably opposed.

Mchmscy conveyed the SC

, feeling that the new system re

duccd students to so many
“numbers," as often happens at
largo universities. and on this
ground his organlxatIon was op-
nannah felt that
neither personality iior qualitas
tivc dinercnces in faculty could
be denied and thus she was
opposed

cheial alternative proposals
were discussed. including one
from the administration that
studentswho were strongly op-
onc professor should
SO Specify in a W“ ten states
ment to the rcgistr r certiﬁed
by the student's adviser.

The suggestion ﬁnally adopt-
ed for presentation to the
Executive Council was that
the old system oi choice be
retained, and that the regis—
