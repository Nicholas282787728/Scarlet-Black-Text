Mears and Goodnow—merely a matter of time

by Flora Winitz
Mears Cottage, listed on the Na-
tional Register of Historical
Places and once proudly boasted
by Grinnell as “the first dore
mitory west oi the Mississippi,"
stands bleakly on South Campus
and is used only ior storage space.
This cottage which holds
historical, sentimental and
aesthetic value to Grinnell was
nearly taken down five years ago.
When the Mary Grinnell Meals
Ladies Cottage was built in was,
the Grinnell catalogue asserted,
“No educational institution offers
better accommodations to young
Women than are found in this cots
tage." According to President
George Drake, the cottage was
built to keep the women students
out oi town where they rented
rooms, and on campus where they
could be better supervised.
Named after Mary Grinnell
Mears, class of mill and daughter
of founder Josiah Bushnell Grins
hell, the cottage was cast as a per-
sonalized. intimate home, rather
than a dormitory. The money ior
constuction was donated by
Mary’s husband, Reverend DI).
Mears and on Jan. l. 1889, thirty
women and Lizzie Scammon. the
housemother. moved into Meals.
The first electric lights on campus
were installed there by Professor
Frank Almy oi the physics depart
ment. These lights predated the
standardized Edison light bulb.
Mears Cottage stood alone on
campus ior many years. All male
students and many female
students still roamed in town. But.
as enrollment steadily increased
and more women were attracted
to Grinnell. additions were made
to Mears.

In 1903, the north wing. which is
a slightly diiierent color brick,
was added and thus increased the
occupancy total to 54. By l9l5. an
enlarged quadrangle was built to
accommodate all women
students. President John Main
originally intended this
quadrangle to be the beginning at
a separate women's school ai-
filiated with Grinnell, similar to
many eastern colleges.

Mears weathered other changes
including the removal of the porch
on the southern side. during the
19205. A pulley used to lift trunks
ior storage in the attic was also
removed. Betweeen 1940 and 1934,
a new entrance was added on and
a women's library was built on the
first floor, The director of food
services was also moved into
Mears.

Mears. which usually housed
ireshmen women. was opened to
male Students in the fall of 1972,
The fall of 1978 was the last year
students would live in the cottage.

Architect Eugene 0'Nei1.whoat
the time was renovating other
dorms on campus. conducted a
study oi Mears and reported that
it was “inherently combustible
and had problems with wiring and
masonry." In addition, Mears had
water leakage and was declared a
fire hazard, '

In 1978, the Board of Trustees
voted to raze Mears. This decision
evoked immediate criticism and
opposition irom alumni, students
and faculty.

At the time history professor
David Jordan's reaction to the
Trustees’ decision put into words
what many people ielt:

“Can the College afford to court
the negative publicity that will

surely tollow ii the trustees pro-
cede to destroy a nationally
recognized and a locally loved
building?"

All adrhoc ‘Save Mears’ con-tr
mittee was termed by students. A
large amount of their work includ-
ed writing letters to alumni infor-
ming them oi the situation and
asking them ior support, On Sept.
29 and 30, “$73. an alumni
volunteer conference was held.
One hundred alumni from across
the country. spanning generations
of graduates, attended a question
and answer session with the
Board of Trustees.

While at the conference. alumna
Margaret M. Kiesel questioned.
“Can the college afford to alienate
many oi its alumni at a time when
it is asking ior larger than ever
alumni contributions at money?"

Numerous alternatives were
suggested in the hope of saying
Mears by alumni and students.
Grinnell, which so strongly sup-
ported women's education. could
turn it into a women‘s center
where women's courses would be
taught and women's conierences
held. Other possibilities included
using Mears as guest accom-
modations both tor returning
alumni and Visiting distinguished
women speakers.

In the spring oi 1979. the Board
of Trustees revoked their decision

to raze Mears. Mears and Good»‘

now Hall, the psychology building,
were oiiicially registered on April
5 or that year as historical
monuments in the National
Register or Historical Places. Col-
lege oiiicials selected Ben Weese
to draw up plans for renovation
and conversion oi Mears. At the
same time, a tourth story was ad-

Mears Hall is one of Grinnell's
iew links with its past, Because
the college moved from its first
campus in Davenport and then in
1882, a cyclone destroyed the se-
cond campus now located in Grin-
nell. the college has only two nine-
teenth century buildings. Alumni
Hall, Chicago Hall. Blair Hall. and
the Women's Gym, all nineteenth
century building . were taken
down between 1958 and 1972.

Goadnnw Hall. built in 1884. is
the oldest building on campus. Eds
ward A. Goodnow. a close friend
of D O. Mears, donated $10,000 for
the construction of Goodnow Hall
which was to be a new library.
Goodnow was an avid promoter oi
higher education [or women.
Besides donating to major eastern
colleges. he also paid for the iirst
college building built for wolrlen
ili Africa.

Goodnow also established ten
permanent scholarships of $60
each ior women attending Grinr
nell. Trustees later converted tlle
scholarships to repayable loans.
Later, Goodnovi oilered a huge en»
dowment to Grinncll if the college
would change its name to Good
now College. but the college refus-
ed,

Goodnow Hall, like Mears. is in
poor condition. The fire marshall
ordered that Goodnow be either
renovated or abandoned by 1986.
according to Drake.

“In many ways Goodnow is our
biggest building problem. The
psychology department is in
desperate shape,” asserted Presi-
dent George Drake.

Most likely, Goodnow will be
converted into an art gallery and
a new building will be built {or
psychology and math. The new
builidng will house the computer
Center,

In 1980 Drake stated:

“Mears might jump ahead at
in line
because it‘s there crying ior
something to he done with it."

Since [930, Burling Library and
most of the dorms have been
renovated. Grinnell House. the
basement of Roberts Theater, the
dining halls and kitchens have
been remodeled. The construction
of the Grant 0, Gale Observatory.
also ‘jumped ahead' of Mears.

"During the past tour or live
years the college has spent twelve
million dollars. Most of that
money came lrom endowments."
said PreSldent Drake. “We simply
haven't raised enough money yet
to renovate Mears and Goodnow."
asserted Drake.

According to VicePrcsiilent and
Dean of Student Affairs James
Tcderlilan, Gl'liiliell has sent an
application to the 01in Foundation
requesting funding ior Meal-s.
This louililation would fund the
renovation or the entire building,
including payment ior rixlures
and equipment Grillllcll has only

thirty that the foundation has

A current evaluation of cost is
under way. President Drake said
that Mears would not cost less
than one million dollars and a new
psychology building would cost
between 2 and 5 million dollas,
ARI-l also is in need of major
repairs,

“Right now, Goodnow is our
number one priority." stated
Drake, “But we haven‘t iorgotten

there almost every day monitors

Mears Cottage. though. will not
be used as a residence hall.
Renovating Mears for sleeping
purposes would be too costly

“It would cost too much to meet
fire regulations for overnight use.
Mears has always been a fire
danger in the past it has had a
special room ior smoking. "And
besides with the addition to Norr
ris. Vie don't need it [or dorm
space." commented Drake.

In the past, ideas ior Mears
have ranged ironi faculty/trustee
lounges to scmin rooms to
Private Dining Rooms. But most
likely, liiears will house the new ,
admissions office.

--l like the idea ol the admis-J
sions oliice reilecting tli‘e’
college's history." remarked .
Drake.

Presently. the admissions office
is in the Forum. one of the more
modern structures on campus,
Drake pointed out that the admis
sions office is hampered by a lack
oi space in the Forum, Admis-
sions and financial aid are expan-
ding and Mears offers the space
that these offices need, In turn.
the absence of admissions and
financial aid in the Forum would
iree that space ior student use.
which was the original purpose oi
the Forum.

”Since admissions needs more
space, that does pul Mears at a '
high priority," Drake disclosed.

Drake stated that one problem
with Mears is that the trustees
still remain divided on deciding
Mears' future. Antother problem
delaying Mears' renovation is that
all the mattresses. beds. chairs.
etc, that are currently being
stored in Mears will have to be put
somewhere else,

If the admissions and financial
aid oiiiccs are put in Mears, they
will not need all the room
available according to rederman.
Seminar rooms. which this camr
pus lacks. and faculty offices,
would also bi located in Mcars.

“If it is converted to the ndmis 4
sions office. id like to get rid of
the north ning and rebuild the .
