THERIL SEEMS to be a growing
tendency to disregard the \x'Ltdis
tional custom otirecognizing Sate
urday evening as peculiarly or
signed to the literary societies.
Of late several social events
have been held on this evening
especially tor the students and the
work of the societies has suFtered
proportionately. The society
work started out tlri year with the
promise to surpass in interest and
merit that of any recent year, but
this promise cannot be kept, it
the work is distracted by the ab
sence of members who attend
gatherings elsewhere. we do not
underestimate the kindness oi
those who errtertai-i the students.
and wish to express the fullest
appreciation felt by the enter-
tained, but we simply request the
co-operation of all friends in suss
tarningthe literary standard and
reputation of the college.

DESPITE THE fact that the so
called Y. M, C. A. plan of admiss
sion has been in vogue hei-e tor
three seasons, and the people
might be supposed to understand
the responsibilities imposed as
well as the advantages offered by
such a system, the receipts at the
lecture last night failed by some;
twenty dollars otpaying expenses
Under this arrangement every one
ot the audience is put upon per
sonal honor in the matter of pilyr
merit and it IS deplorablr: that any
should [all to fulﬁll his trust, as
some certainly did last night. It
is absurd to think that an audi-
ence such as greeted the lecturer
last night would not meet and
