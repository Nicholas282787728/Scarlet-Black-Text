CllOir Presents ‘Messia

 

Pioneers Win

Opener Over
Coe 38-28

Kohawks Lead at
Half 18-17; Fort
Scores 15 Points

By Clark A. Smith.

Gl’ll‘lnell opened its basket—
ball season last night with a

convincing 38 to 28 victory
over Coe college. After a rugged

and rough first half marked by
poor floor play and frequent foul-
ing by both teams, the invaders
from Cedar Rapids left the floor
with an 13 to 17 lead.

Shortly after the start of the
final half, the Pioneers settled
down in their playing and took a
commanding lead that left the
outcome of the game never in
doubt.

Fort Leads Scar-big.

Sensational shooting and floor
play by sophomore Jerry Fort was
largely responsible for building up
the Pioneers' lead. The little for-
ward scored 15 points to lead the
scoring of both teams.

Coe presented a team that made
up for what it lacked in polish
and finesse with plenty of heft
and drive. They used 11 men in
the contest and kept up an ag-
gressive attack all evening. Cisler
and Marshall played outstanding
ball for the Kohawks and led in
scoring with six points each for
their team.

more or less of a larlr.
