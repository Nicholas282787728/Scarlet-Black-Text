A Closer look at the new smoking ban

When the Iowa Smokcfrce Air Act went into effect mini)!
1, speculation ran rampant as to exactly how the law would an
pact campus. Would dozens of people be seen standing in the
middle ofPark and East streets acquiring their precious puffs?
Worrld rumors stream through the school about unjust 5100
ﬁnes while Grinnellians looked for intrepid lawyers to argue
the acts unconstitutionallry? lfRandy Brush, ofall people, quit,
is that not a sure sign of the smoking apocalypse? Given the
relatively conflictrfrec nature of smoking on camprrs, it is not
surprising that students might react in this fashion.

While the sons loves to complain about campus issues.
we’ve never had cause to complain about smoking and we have
rarely heard anti-smoking protest from others. (Admittedly,
most ofus do live on South campus.) Grinnell’s smoking cul-
ture, especially its lounges, is a mainstay otcampus lire, helped
by the fact that the rare conﬂict between smokers and “an,
smokers never bubbles over into an actual argument. Unsure
prisingly, asking smokers to move to another area is an effective
way to prevent secondhand smoke, and this simple conversar
tion probably does as much as any state law.

Now that solrd information has replaced speculation and
vague e-mails, revealing the college's official approach, rt seems
our initial fears might have been a bit overblown. Aside from

r think ihdl no

the removal of those handy smokers' outposts/doorsrops, no
cigarettes on the way to class in the morning, and the elimina-
tion cismokrng lounges, the core smoking culture will change
little. With enforcement not high on Security’s todo list. stur
dents will not have to worry about that pesky 8100 finklhe
most unnerving part of the act—as long as
they are on campus,just a request to put out . .
the cigarette. If necessary, this same request
should come from students annoyed by set
olld-lland smoke, should it arise,

In the end, the real test of the act will not
be how well Glinncllians can Fcbrecze their '
room or hide from Security at 3:00 a.m,, but
instead how well thnnelllnns can enforce
selfrgovcrnancc and maintain the already tolerant smoking cul»
runs that already eXlsted on campus. While the law may seem
damaging to the harmless orinnell smoker. the government
isn't actually out to get us, and the administration’s approach
will allow the friendly Grinnell smoking discourse to remain
intact.

Avoiding unnecessary cigarette refuse

While selfrgovernance may assist in curbing any negative
effects of the new smoking laws, the laws do present some new
problems. Several changes have occurred since the smoking ban
went into effect which include the dismantling of the smok-
iilg \lcnrs on Cleveland first and the removal of the smokers'
orrtposts (receptacles used for the safe disposal ofcigaletles),

The perks of voting in Iowa

It‘s worth repeating: in Iowa this fall, every
vote counts.

if you're like me and you support more
money for education, health care, green tech
nology and an increased minimum wagb
you’ll be casting your vote for Barack Obama
and State Representative Eric Palmer here in
Grinncll this Novemberr

Iowa is my home. I Live here 9 out of 12
months of the year. I work here. 1 pay taxes
here. I obey state and local laws here.

1 know some people feel weird changing
their registration. I did’i‘nd I’m from DC.
where the nearly 600,000 residents don't even
have a vote in the House or Senate (even
though we pay taxes, frght in wars and serve
on juries). But then I realized that in Grinnell
I could vote for men and women who would
make it difference both to my life here aild to
the lives of my family back in D.C.

Barack Obama and Eric Palmer need our
help, lowa is a swing state and our county,
Poweslliek County, is deeply dividedijohn
Kerry won it by only 78 votes in 2004, In 2000.
Al Gore lost by only 2 votcs per precinct. in.

In his ﬁrst term our state representative,

Eric Palmer has made me proud.

He passed a law that will give 10,000 unin-
sured children heath care. He voted to increase
education funding to combat rising college tu-
ition costs. He worked to promote wind and
solar energy. He outlawed workforce drscrimir
nation against real or perceived sexual oricnr
ration. (When Republican Danny Carroll was
our representative, you could be fired in Iowa
for being gay He doesn't think that students
have a right to vote and he vmnts to write dis-
crimination against the queer community into
the Iowa State Constitution).

In addition, when Eric Palmer increased
Iowa’s minimum wage, it raised my workrstudy
wage by more than a dollar, which helped cw
ery studcntworldng on campus or in town.

As for the smoking bani Because of my
severe asthma, I couldn’t work at places Like
Lonski's or the Pub in town to supplement my
DannyrCatroll-five—doilar-an-hout—job.

I’m not antissmoking, but for thc ﬁlst time
in the four years I've lived here I can go out
with my friends to grab a sandwich, or a beer,
or a part time job That’s change I can believe

It is the latter that causes worry. Gtinncll has always been a
relatively clean campus, and with legal spots to smoke narrowed
down to several ptrblrclyrowned areas; the accumulation ofcigr
arette butts is inevitable. The responsibility [3115 not only on
those students who smoke but also the school. Even though the
receptacles are not allowed on campus, the college should work
to create solutions that ensure the
cleanliness orrhe Grinnell campus.

We want dispensers

Where, oh where have our
napkrns gone? Last spring, Din-
ing Services decided to replace our
napkin boxes with napkin baskets,

a poor substitute by any measure. It is signiﬁcantly harder to
grab just one or two napkins from a basket, likely increasing
napkin waste. Second, why can’t there be enough baskets to put
one on every table.> Under the new system, we can’t have any
napkins on the outside tables because they’ll blow away out or
the baskets—nor a problem with our dearly departed napkin
boxes. And let’s not forget about the most Grinnellian part of
the napkin boxes: those little cards on the sides where students
could write and draw as they pleased. Some cards were snarky,
some were dorky, and some were just plain weird. But they were
part of Grinncll’s human touch, and like the writing on the
bathroom walls ofBurling, they made Grinnell special. With
these changcs,we are not only stuck eating an a dining hall with
fewer napkins but also one with less personality
