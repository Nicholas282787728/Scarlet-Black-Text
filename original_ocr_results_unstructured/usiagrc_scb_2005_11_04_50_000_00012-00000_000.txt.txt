BOO-YA! Pioneers celebrate Halloween early with the MWC title

BY MARISA WHlTLEV

Pioneer fans who braved the chilly weather last
weekend were treated to back-to-back demonstmr
tions ofcollege soccer at its best. Four ofthe best DIII
women’s teams in the MWC went head-to—head over
the weekend in a drawn out battle for the conference
title and a bid to the NCAA tournament.

The Grinnell women's soccer team had an amaz-
ing weekend, defeating Lake Forest in the semifinals
on Saturday and bringing home the conference title
after a gripping shootout that gve Grinnell the win,

The women went into Saturday‘s match against
Lake Forest “at a disadvantage,” said defender Gabi
Maldonado-Bell ’09. “We had already lost to Lake
Forest they obviously had one up on us."

The team stepped up to the challenge and came
out with a 2-0 victory with goals scored by Katherine
Ni 09 and MaldonadOrBell in the 41st and 88th mint
utes, respectively.

“The freshmen really stepped up [this weekend]
and made their presence known," said Maldonadv
Bell.

Sundays tournament finals pitted the Carroll
Lady Pioneers against Grinnells own Pioneers. Carr
roll and Grinnell both went into the finals with eight
conference victories under their belts, indicating the
dominating presence of both of these teams during
the regular season,

Neither team backed down for even one second
during the entire match. Although there were no
points on the board at the half, the score did not re-
ﬂect the aggressive intensity of the game.

The game quickly became very physicltl. A total of
35 fouls were called during the match, 20 to Carroll
and 15 to Grinnell.

“[Carroll] always are a physical team. 1 think evr
eryone dealt With it pretty well andjust tried to keep
playing our game,”sa-rd midfielder and team captain
Kara Moskowitz '06.

The physical tension came to a head when for—
ward Kate Diedrick ’07 was removed late in the game
after a soft red card, leaving the Pioneers one player
short for the remainder of the match.

"I didn’t feel like [the red card] was-deserved at
all,” said Kara Moskowitz.

"Last weekend’s game got really crazy, there were
cards everywhere," said midﬁelder Julie Ault '08. “I
think the refs were trying to keep it under control."

caroll tied the game in the 80th minute of play,
which forced the game into two scoreless overtime
periods.

“I didn't think there was any way we were going to
be able to score with one man down in overtime,"said
Kara Moskowitz._

Grinncll sent Rachel Moskowitz '06, Kara Mos
kowitz, Sofia Skraba '08 ,Julja Bradleerook'Oo and
goalkeeper Liz Carrier ’07 into the shoot—out. All of
the Pioneers made their penalty kicks and onc miss
by a Carroll player was enough to secure the MWC
title for Grinnell.

Going into double overtime and having people
playing 110 minutes ofsoccer andjust being exhausts
ed, I think we showed a lot of heart In doing what
we needed to do," said Kara Moskowitz. ‘We had the

home field advantage, the fans and we really, really
wanted' it."

This is the first time since 2002 that the Grin—
nell team has won both the conference title and the
MWC tournament.

The team is also ranked 10th regionally. the first
time this has happened since Coach Heather Ben—

.ning took over the team eight years ago. The team

will move on to nationals in early November, possibly
playing Loras or Macalastcr in the first round.

“I think we can definitely hang with them," said
Maldonado—Bell. “We just need to be able to keep our

cool and play our game.”

Football looking for help at hOme

The Pioneers are struggling to stay positive as
they prepare for the last two games of the season after
a ﬁve game losing streak.

“The guys are {nistrated right now, as are the
coaches," said offensive coordinatorjeffPederson,“but
we have still had very upbeat and productive practices.
I think they are confident we can finish strong these
last two games."

In their most recent loss, Grinnell fell to St. Nor-
bert 63-14 after giving the Green Knights'offense the
run of the field for three quarters. St. Norbert went
into the fourth quarter with a 5670 lead.

“St, Norbert executed the entire game," said Nick
Merklin '03. “They exploited gaps we left open and
our coverages when we blltaed."

The Grinnell defense has allowed at least 40
points in four of the last five games.

The offense has also struggled as oflate, but Ped-
ersen and his players are looking to put up some points
in the remaining two games of the season.

“We have to be able to control the line of scrimr
mage and get blocks clownﬂeld to allow our running
game to get going," said Todd Doleshal '08. “If that
happens, then the passing game will take care ofit-
self "

Grinnell finishes the season at home, with a game
this Saturday against Carroll College at 1 pm. and
another home game next Saturday against Beloit
College. With the playoffs out of the picture, head
coach Greg Wallace, his coaching staff-and the players
are looking for ways to end this season on a positive _
note to boost morale.

“The team morale isn't the best it's ever been, but
we're hanging in there," said Merklin. “With a young,
inexperienced team we're taking our lumps. Hope—
fully we can learn from games like these for the next
couple of years to come. We have two weeks left and
we feel we can surprise some people. "

Teamwork was one of the team’s
