GCSAS to
write code
of conduct

by David Nathan
Staff Writer

After discussion limiters with the
Board or’l‘rustccs, Gruuroll College Stun
dents Against Sweatshops (GCSAS) hu
added a new obieeuve to its agenda. Be
fore rhe eud orrhe year, the group will
draft a Code ofConducl by which doth»
rug suppliers will have to abide by m or-
elcr to receivc Grlnncll College's business.
A code or conduct is rcqllltcd by the
Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) in
order for colleges to be full members of
rho organization; as it stands rrghr now,
Grinnell College is a provisional member.

Another result or meeting the board
ol’trustccs is better communication bee
rween the group and the board. “My im»
pressiou or rhe trustees changed,” said
Ellery Sills ’03. “Formally, I saw them as
passive and reluctantly receiving our coh-
(orns on the issue...now I see them as
maiuug an honest attempt ro be fair to
both [the FIA and WRcl,”

It isn‘t a complete love roar berween
the group mad the rrusrees, however. “let
me hureu ro point out that there are about
ﬁve to seven u’uﬂcts who are interested
in this issue and the rest know very little,"
said Sills. Mcmbtrs ofGCSAS are coll-

Talking with ,
SGA President-elect
Paul Robeson Ford

1

Bath you and Vire-President—elert Rosenberg
defeated your opponents by substantial margins,
[rutbecause of two large numbers of abstentions,
Gabe missed a runoff by 11 vats, and you came
within 16 votes ofa second round afcandidates
Do you (onsideryaur mandate to be 15 pertent
or 1.5 percent?

Half orthoso people who voted cast their ballot for me,
It is a greater mandate than any U.S. president has had
anditis one of the beneﬁts or setting a higher threshold
for victory. Von must convince a greater percentage of
people that you Will serve them well, I take pride in
having commanded 51% ofthe vote.

Predictions on what big issua might be next
year?

55A has some serious kinks that need to be worked
out, in terms of its governing structure. We are going to
begin working on those after Spring Break, and I suspect
these efforts may go in to the fall. "Big issues" arise
every year, but what they are is always hard to predict.

My goal is to make sure that the student body is not
orcludad horn making deo‘sions about these ”big issues,”
whatever they may be.

During the campaign you repeatedly spoke about
various instant—as of student disenfranchisement.
What actions will you take early next year to bring
these to the front?

I will be introduced to the Trustees as SGA President in
May. I plan on inviting other students at large, as well as
the college press, to join me during this portion of the
meeting. In addition, I am going to push to have at least
2 student positions created for every anstee committee.
We are also going to make sure that all committees that
senators serve on (such as Dining Services, of course) are
following the mles that have been laid out for each, to
ensure a democratic process. The troubling pattern of
tuition increases will abo be a topic of discusslon,

Any guidelines in mind yet for selecting rabinet
appointees?
Iwanted committed people who are willing to putin 2o

30 hours a week to provide quality service to our
community. As far as a selection process, we will be
distributing applications after break.

Was this election as functional as we can zeroed
them to be, or were there had ralls?Doyallf075L’e
rhonges to come, suth as clonfiratians of the
abstention polity ar Shannon Anderson’s insoant
runoff proposal?

It is likely that an ad-hoc committee will be formed to
examine election policy It remains to be seen what
proposaB will come out of that effort, but sufﬁce to say,
there must be some suhsbantial changes made in the way
we conduct our business.

Anything else you’d like to add?

I am here to serve the community. I don’t plan on
disappointing any of my supporters. In relation to die
rest of Amenca (and no doubt, most college campuses)
we live in a utopia. eut even this utopia has some need
for improvement. We’re going to work out these problems
and have some run along the way.

Master plan to move library north

by Annalisa Hultberg
Staff Writer

As a pan or the campus muslcr plan, the Libnry
Building Planning Committee is proposing a new li-
brnry to repiaee Burling north or ot Avenue where
Darby gym curmntly no. The proposed library would
be approxmutdy more as big as Burliug and would sit
adiacont to a new umpus center.

“Burlingwar plannedtoIllstuillilabolrtthlstime,"
snirl Christopher McKee, chair ofthc Library Eurlrln
log Flannlng Comm rte "Now we are running our
ofroom, and lt [B ' ] will continue to become more
and more dysruuerional."

ourlmg Lrhnry, at 60,759 square leer, is thcsmilll-
est library orany oirhe twelve liberal arts colleges used
as eomparisona, said l’rcsldcllr Russell Osgood in a
(ampusewltlc memo sent on March 12 regarding the
auupus plan update

The lamr proposal, according to Osgood, u that
use ncwbuilclilrg be approximately 159,000 squntofcot,
93,700 square feer would bu assigned losrrlcrly library
runeoons and 22,300 root are designated ior lnformi‘l»
lion Technology Servrzts (ITS). Must. if not all, says
Osgood, of ITS will he locatml in the building: there

and all study stations wlll be wired for technology.

The proposed library would house up to 700.000
volumes, whereas current holdings are approximarely
460.000 Scnrlng would iump rrom us present eapaeiry
of37l ro 600, with ten peroent orseaung dedrrared to
group study rooms.

“Boiling is dohmrely crowded,” raid reieunre hbmn
iair and mcml-rcrotthc Library Building Planning Com-
mirree Catherine Rod. “we are partlcularly looking to
increase the number oigroop study rooms- loo ofstudy-
ing at Grinnell is clone in group: . and we would love to
areornmodare rhar."

Proposal: den include increased ouiar arm on man
rloor, :lcliissroom for information-literacy .nserurrmn (re.
placing the current HP), and rwooinsarninareype rooms
rhar would double as (onttrcnct room: ior and meet-
logs. sinnwould have approximately 35 workplaces rhar
include IO ofﬁces, which will be more easily aeeesslble
than rho aurrcnt oiriees.

lntrcasct in library holdings would be largely in me
dia formau audspeeral collections, where the largest need
for growrh is expected. The College Archives and special
collection: (lowa Room) would be rour times the eurraur
sire. Audiovisual space would have at least six times the
numbers ofCDs, Dvor, and videos as does rhe presenr

hitching room in burling,

The new library “is envisioned as the spirit and hour
otmeriouslyaoademic institution," said President Osgood
in his memo.

As the new library is still in the early stage: or plan.
ning, thore has not yet been much Student fccdlxlck on
ma speeihe properale. some studenu though. after read»
my; osgood's mono. felt rh: new plan was too ambirious.

“I think the new layout stems lnreroung and inno-
vative," said senior Raehel Lieberman, “But 1 door really
to: rho need {or such a dourie lnercasc m sire. There is
plenry orroom in Eurllng Does this mean they are gasp
mg up to double me student population orerinnellz"

The Library lenlng Commute: is aware rhar slur

to change the good opens of h.

said Rod, “we need to keep the parts orpurling rhar
male students like irTho good Vlews and interestlllgstudy
spaces are imporraur to include in the new building."

No date for a ﬁnished plan or a probzble time for
hcgilmlng building is set.

“A tllneline in construction otthc new library is not
yer ser," says McKee “The preliminary Stage is lust end
mg and die design phase will be eonringenr on hurher
Board ofTrusrct: approval."
