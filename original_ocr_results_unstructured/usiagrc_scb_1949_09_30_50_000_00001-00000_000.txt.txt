Stevens at the game, replacing
the usual President's party and
,dance on campus.

Convocal‘ion
:Sl'arls Year;
Prexy Speaks

The 1949—50 Grinnell school
ycai- got underway Sept. 22 with
officai greetings officers and
and administration officers and
one of the most challenging and
vigorous addresses in recent
years by President Stevens.

Last week's all college con-
vocation in Darby gym had all
the familiar ceremony of past
opening sesions. New faces on the
speaker's platiorm were Dr,

, Winston L, King, new Dean of

the Chapel, who delivered the
invocation, and Earl Peisner,
president of the Studcnt Council,
wlic, with Dean of the College
Earl D. Strong, extended greet—
ings to new and veteran Grin-
nellians.

President Stevens delivered the

' main address of the morning on

the theme “Freedom Through

. Discipline” as applied to an aca-

demic life in college and after
graduation.

with the idea put forward that
the task or education in the mad»
ern world is education for freee
dom, President Stevens said that
human beings must be guided by
the fact that true freedom can
only be obtained and retained
through Vigorous discipline of
mind and body.

Many students, President Stev-
ens said, find themselves pose
sesscd by the college, in tyranny
to the college, because of their
inability or unwillingness to ace
ccpt the idea of freedom through
a discip . ed mind.

Dr. Stevens pointed out that
ordinary day day tasks like
dr ssing or drivmg a Car call for
a tremendous amount of muscu—
lar discipline before they can be
accomplished with complete
freedom. Thus also. he said, “ins
tellectual freedom comes only
with the ability to discipline our
minds."

President Stevens slid into the
medium of modern economic life
for the climax oi his address
and dramatically excoriated the
results of the p 'dential fact
finding hoard inquiry in the cur—
rent big steel labor dispute,

Speaking of the section of the
report dealing with pensions and
'insul‘ance for workers being paid
alone by management, Dr. Steve
cns said that placing a worker
on the level of a machine as an
industrial commodity would
serve to deprive him of the his
.traditional right to make his
own security, and would reduce
his incentive to discipline him—
\self for the greatest freedom.

The greetings oilered by Peis-
ner and Dean Strong stressed
the idea for collective effort toe
ward complete cooperation in all
aspects of college life.

IPreps 365 Slrong;
153 Class l-las Spirit

 

This year's freshman class, in
the opinion of all who have seen
the freshmen in one gathering,
has the most spirit of all the
new classes that have entered
Grinnell in many a year. This
has been demonstrated recently
at tho pep rallies in the little
theatre and the women’s gym
and at both of the football games
so for, where the freshman
cheering section blasted away
with 'all its 365 strong.

Demonstrating President Stev-
ens’ plan to have Grinnell a
community composed of people
from many sections of the coun-
try and of the world, this year’s
class is represented by 29 states
plus Hawaii, Norway, Jugoslavia,
Turkey, The United Kingdom,
and Germany. Also part of
President Slevens’ aim is to have
as many religions represented as
possible, so no less than 21 dif-
ferent beliefs are represented by
the 167 men and 197 women who
comprise the class of ’53- Grin—
nell would like to admit more
foreign students, according to
Miss Pruyn of the president‘s
oilice, but due to the severe cur-
rency restriction, it virtually im-
possible loi- students to obtain
the necessary dollars, and ar-
range for transportation.

The Freshman class has bu~
come infused at an early time
by the Grinncll spirit of coni—
radship and friendliness, The
men are jumping into the prep»
ping program with great sports-
manship, and the bank of red
caps that are to be seen on the
bleachers during the football
games is a cheering sight in-
deed. Two girls, both from Oslo.
Norway, find the life here new,
friendly, and exciting. Amelia
Olsen, and Kari Strom recently
arrived in this country, and want
to see all of it before they' go
home in a few years.

All the freshmen are busily en<
gaged in learning the Grinnell
way of life, and all of them seem
to like it,
