P- A- 60m.h

Gadien’r Goes

Motives behind the sudden re—
moval of the public address sys
tem from the quad dining room
has been somewhat of a mystery
to the student body as well as
to head waiter Dick Gadient. For
over two weeks now, Dick has
been over-exercising his vocal
cords to make luncheon and dill-
ner announcements without rea-
lizing why the P. A. had been
taken from the dining room.

Miss Nellie Gleason today
threw some light on the situation
by stating that it was decided
recently in a meeting of herself,
Miss Evelyn Gardner, and Mr.
L, v. Phelps, that the system
was not used enough to warrant
its maintainance. According to
Miss Gleason “disfiguring" of
the dining room would have had
to be done in order to meet the
specifications of an inspector re—
gardmg the wires.

Therefore the three felt that
with a much smaller student
body than the 430 at the opening

of school, now eating ,in the
dining room, and with a little co-
operation from students, vocal
announcements without the mike
would be as satisfactory, “A lit-
tle less noise on the part of stu-
dents while announcements arc
made will certainly help the an-
nouncer," Miss Gleason added.

So the motto of the week is,
moi-c power (vocal) to you, Dick
Gadienti

Lowered Requiremen’rs
For $2.600 Grade Jobs

Because of the urgent need for
economists, economic analysts,
and statisticians for civilian war’
service in the Federal Govern-
ment, recruiting is being inten-
sified for these positions on a
nation-wide basis. the Civil Salk
vice Commission announced today.

The positions pay from $2,600 to
$6,500 a year plus overtime.
which increases salaries by about
21% on the first $2,900 for 3 hours
overtime, when the aggregate does
not exceed $5,000 a year.

The gieatest need is in the
fields of transportation, labor,
commodities, and industrial stud
ics, the release said. For econor
mist, marketing, international
trade, money and banking, and
housing are also important fields.
Experience in other lines will also
be utilized, and complete infore
mation may be obtained at first-
and second-class post offices, from
Service Regional offices,
and from the U. S. Civil Service
Commission at Washington, D. C.

Positions are both interesting
and important to the war prep
grain, They include dealing with
economic and statistical problems
arising from the reoccupatioii of
areas once held by the enemy, th‘!
sale of U. S. securities, exports
and imports in connection with the
war economic program, and re-
quirements for procurement of
war materials, Positions will be
located throughout the United
states and a few will be filled
abroad.

Requirements for the positions
have been lowered, In general,
only 5 years of college or univer—
sity education or experience in
economics or statistics, or a com-
bination of the two, are neces-
sary for the $2,600 grade. The
minimum requirements for the
higher grades are proportionately
greater,

There are no age limits and no
written examination will be given.

further notice, but qualified per»
sons are asked to apply lmme~
diately. Applications are not desir-
