The Grinnell College men's 1mg,
ketball teams heads into the Midwest
Conference Tournament today as the
number three seed, squaring off against
the tough, nationally ranked Cars
roll College team at 5 pm. today. The
MWC tournament this year is hosted
by Lawrence University in Appleton,
Wisc.

This match-up represents the semi-
final round for the Grinnell Pioneers.
A victory today will place them in
the Conference championship game
against the winner of the Lawrence/
Knox contest that will also be decided
later this evening.

Grinnell secured the three seed
with an impres-
sive victory over

Knox to 43 percent shooting in the
second half and outscored the Prairie

the game.

“Beating Knox at home on senior
night was very important,” said Davie
Arsencnult,“becanse it allows us to play
Carroll in the first round ofthe confer
ence tournament instead of Lawrence
on their home floor.”

The Pioneer victory cemented
Grinnell's place in the Midwest Col-ls
felence Tournament and it made tlleir
final regular-season contest at Lake
Forest College somewhat meaningless
in terms ofplayoffimpact.

Grinnell fell behind early against
the Foresters during their game against
Lake Forest last Saturday, trailing by

strong performance, with ﬁve Grinnell
players putting up double ﬁgules dur
ing the game. Giotberg scoled 24
points and Arseneault added 16 points
and seven assists. Bobby Long '09 had
12 points, Keith Chamberlain ’03 put
up 11 points and Ticus also put up 11
points as well as a couple orsteals dur-
ing the game.

Unfortunately this impressive effort
by several key players on the teain was
not enough to overcome the Forester
offensive attack. The Pioneers continr
ued to struggle down the stretch, event
tually falling to the Foresters, 110-93.
The men’s basketball team is hoping
that the loss on Saturday does not carry
over into the tournament.

“I don’t think
that the loss to
Lake Forest Wlll
really hurt us," said
Schmidt. “It will
make us just want
to come back and
“in our first tours
nament game even
more."

Head Coach
Dave Alseilcault
felt that his team
had something to
learn from the loss

“I’m not sure
what happened at Lake Forest," said
Coach Arseneault. “We were ﬂat for the
lirst ttrnc this year. line were thinking
ahead to the playoffs, then I hope there
is a less lealnetl—stay in the moment!"

Grinnell will indeed have to stay in
the moment later tonight as they take
on a Carroll team that handed the Pior
neers a highsseoring loss at home ears
lier this year.

A victory will have to be hard»
earned and the reward will be out more
round ivlth Lawrence University on
their home court.

The Pioneers will have to worry
about Lawrence later as they must dc—
feat the Carroll Pioneers to reach the
ﬁnals. '

“Carroll is a load," said Coach Arse-
neanlt. “i am stiu searching out a game
plan. 1 do know that i will be leaning
on a couple of out better players for

atch with the chance for the MWC championship at stake

Men’s tennis picks up another win

3v ANDv CHoN

Instead of a pair of wins this past weekend, the
Grinnell men's tennis team only came away with one.
However, the Pioneers‘perfect record is still intact.

Grinnell was scheduled to play a pair orbaekstos
back meets Feb. 18 against Beloit College and Watts
burg College, but the meet against Beloit was can-
celed due to bad weather, leaving the Pioneers with
only one meet on Saturday.

The Wartburg Knights were no competition for
the Pioneers, who racked up another shutout victory,
closing the game 7-0.

“We played really well," said Eli Best '07. “We
were expecting Wartburg'to be a little stronger."

No Grinnell singles players dropped more than
two games in a set. Both Best and Rick Fenbert '06
lost only one game in their respective matches.

The Pioneers also had an impressive performance
from the doubles teams. Freshmen Dan Lafountdille
and Nate Fox took down their opponents, ssl, The
two other doubles teams that Grinnell fronted during
the meet defeated their competition 8-3.

The win last weekend makes the men's tennis
team's record 370.

Although the Knights did not leave a strong in
pression on the Pioneers, the meet against VVarlburg
provided valuable insight into Grinnelrs position
relative to other schools early in the season.

Coe College, a very strong conference opponent,
posted similar scores against Wartburg, which is ens

couraging news for the Pioneers who face One on
March 18. ,

“We are as good as we’ve ever been," said Best.
“We’ve got a chance to win the conference again and
maybe go a little further.”

The men’s tennis team will be making up for the
slack last week with a fllll schedule this weekend.

“We have an away meet on Friday and two home
meets on Saturday,” said Best. “That’s a lot of tennis."

“1 think it's really going to help us in out condi-
tioning and mental focus,” said Fox. “We haven't had
this many matches in a row, so we'll be able to see
what we’re capable of.”

The Pioneers play the University of Wisconsin,
Oshkosh this afternoon at S p.m. in Cedar Rapids,
lowa and go up against Cornell College and Buena
Vista College tomorrow at 9 am. and 1 p.m. rcspces
tively on the indoor tennis courts.

- “This weekend ifwe play well, we shouldn’t have
trouble with any of the schools," said Best, “We ale
kind otcalling these matches tune ups to get us ready
for the future."

Most of the Pioeerb are looking ahead and despite
their strong position, they ale not ready to underesti—
mate the competition.

“Every school has the opportunity to do damage
against us,"said Fox. “It's whether or not we have the
ability to step up our game and keep our mental focus.
We'll be looking ahead to Carleton next week. I think
they'll be our toughest opponent yet."

Grinnell College Swimming and Diving

When Peter Brown '06 arrived at the University of Chicago to compete in the
Midwest Invitational. he was only accompanied by Head Coach Erin Hurley and
he only swam in one event. Brown was the only member orcrinnelrs swimming
and diving team participating in the meet, giving him one last chance to represent
the Pioneers before the swimming post—season finally came to a close.

The Invitational was the last meet of the season for Brown, at least until he
finds ollt ifhe has made Nationals.

Although Brown did not beat his conference time of46.36 in the 100 freestyle,
he still won the competition, which boosted his conﬁdence.

“I feel a little more confident simply because I know I've done the best that]
can do and that there is nothing more I can control,“ he said. “That was a large part
of the reason why i went to the meet."

Now Brown, along with divers Dan Shryock '06 and Sarah Staycr '06 must
wait until next Friday to find out if their provisional qualifying performances will
allow them to advance to Nationals, which will be held March 1618 at the Unit
versiry ofMinnesora.

The three seniors are not as nervous about the upcoming news as might be
expected.

“Of coulse I'd prefer to know now," said Brown, “but at this point there is no
reason to stress since it‘s not going to change anything.”

Brown, Shryock and stayer will continue to practice until they ﬁnd our irthcy
will be competing, Even though the season is over tor the rest ortbe ream, team-
mates have come out to practice with the trio to provide support.

“Tile teain and my teltmmates have been extremely helpful in getting me this
far," said Brown.
