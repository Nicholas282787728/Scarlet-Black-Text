ANSWER TO THE COMMITTEE

Editor‘s Note: To understand the um

gnmcnts presented here, the reader is

asked to read first the editorial, ”The

Committee Replies" elsewhere on this

page.

The White House committee in its fervor
and zeal for what it thinks is a just cause
has over looked and over emphasized some
very important points. In its editorial,
it says, "The fact remains that the White
House was established for all the students
of Gl'innell college.” The White House coni-
mittee should recognize the fact that the
town men are just as much a part of Grin-
nell college as they are, as the men and
women of the residence halls. The White
House committee should also realize that
ever since the dormitories were established,
the town men have been at a distinct dis-
advantage, Say what you will about the
town men being welcome at the dorms, say
what you will about the town men entering
into the social life of the campus through
the medium of the dorms, and, granted
that there is no intentional feeling on the
part of the dormitory men, the fact remains
that because of the very physical conditions
separating the town men from the dorms
the town men have never entered into dor-
mitory life as they should for the simple
reason that they have never been really at
home there. There has been no feeling of
outright antagonism, but there has been a
feeling of antipathy that has reduced the
town men’s organization to a lethargic or-
ganization from which they are at last try-
ing to arise

The White House committee further says,
”In so far as it is monopolized by any one
group (inferring the town men) of students,
it is defeating its own purpose." There has
been no indication that the town men have
monopolized the White House, that they are
monopolizing the White House or that they
ever will monopolize the White House. When
the White House committee granted them
the right to have open house on Friday
nights, it could expect no more than to
have the town men take it over and make
all the arrangements necessary to such an
undertaking. And this is only once a week,
Friday night from 8:30 to 11:30. Three
hours of management, not ITIOnopOIlZatIOn.

Contrary to opinion, the town men’s room
in the White House is open for cards,
smoking and coke drinking on Friday
nights and no one has Ever been excluded
from the town men’s mum at any time!
Also, it is argued that the town men take
over to such an extent that the quadrangle
women can not go there for their usual
Friday night smoke and relaxation. Let it
be known that the second floor is open for
any and all activities that are conducted in
the lounge on the first floo'

The town men want dormitory and quad
rangle students to come there for it good
time, whether they have at date or not.

There is every reason to believe that if
the town men could be induced to come to
the White House open houses, with or With—
out dates, they would naturally wander
over to the dormitories. And there is no
reason why, with the inducement of good
entertainment, that the couples from the
dorms will or would not come to the White
House. The White House committee had

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

better change its isolationist policy for on
open door policy! It would be much more
sane. ’

The committee further says, “The town
men have argued that the White House
would furnish an opportunity for Grinnell
to have one place where a stag line would
be permitted ..... There can be no stag
liiie without stags.”

The committee insists on the impossible.
Here at Grinnell we have an unusual situa-
tion. Unfortunately, it is a tradition on this
campus that most activities are date affars.
This is a deep rooted tradition, and any
student under ordinary conditions seems to
shrink from going against this, Yet, what
could seem more foolish? Is there no whole—
some effect and good time to be had by a
non-date group activity‘.7 Undeniably yes!
And yet, because of this date tradition, it
will take time to establish such group activ-
ities. The White House open houses are a
real and genuine attempt to do' this, and it
should be respected as such. The social coin-
mittee and the campus as a whole should
get behind the town men and back them in
their attempt to give this campus something
it has needed for a long time.

The White House committee says, “We
appreciate the care the town men have giw
an to the furniture on Friday nights, but
the fact remains that moving furniture
cannot help but increase its depreciation
greatly, throwing a financial burden upoli
the student body.” Let us examine the facts.
One couch, one lounge chair, one arm chair,
one ash tray and one stand are moved into
the house mother’s room. The card tables
and chairs are taken upstairs for the non-
dating students who do not care to dance.
This is for their encouragement and pleas-
ure. They are cordially invited, if they do
not care to dance, to use them on the second
floor. The rugs are put in the storage room.
One lounge, one easy chair, one ash tray
and one lamp are left in the room for the
use and convenience of the dancers. This
is less, far less movement than the furniv
turo at the dorms gets, and to all reason-
able minded persons, the wear and tear can
not help but appear negligible.

The committee further says, “We are not
antagonistic to the interest and welfare of
the town people. On the contrary, we earns
estly desire to have the town men possess
a strong organization, and we also want
them to accept the hearty invitation to the
activities of he halls with which they are
associated. We want the town men to be
among us, parts of the Grinnell campus in
every possible way.”

If they really octave what they say in
this lost quote thel/ nlll revise their stand
without fll’l‘tlu’l’ adieu. They will help the
tow men instead of hinflei' them, thereby
helping the students (is trell/

SUPPORT THE WHITE HOUSE

Last night the town men were given a new
lease on life. After the rather pre-emptory
action by the White House committee the
Student Council magnaniinously voted to al-
low the town men a “trial period” of three
weeks in which to prove whether they can
make a success of their open house. Al—
though this places undue pressure on the
town men, they have accepted the probav
tion period and are going to try to put
their idea ovelx

The towli men’s open houses and the
idea the organization is trying to put
across, deserves the wholehearted support of
the entire student body, The idea of having,r
a non-date affair in conjunction with a date
affair on this campus is a worthy idea and
deserves the genuine and sincere backing
that the town men are trying to give it.

On these next few Friday nights in par
ticular, and on other Friday nights in gens
oral throngliout the rest of the year, those
students who are genuinely interested in
seeing a broader base for our social life
here on the Grinnell campus established,
should make it their special point to visit
the White House open house and help the
town men in their attempt. The social com-
mittee, in particular, should be especially
interested in furthering this attempt as it
affords an excellent place to try out one of
its particular ideas in connection with more
non—date social affairs.

COMMITTEE REPLIES

To the White House committee,
the cards are also up, but we be-
lieve that we are putting all of
them up. Before we revise our
stand as suggested by the Scarlet
and Black, we would like to pros
sent the other side of the argu
ment.

It may be a brutal suggestion
to some people, but the fact re»
mains that the White House was
established for all the students of
Grinnen college. in so far as it
is monopolized by any one group
of students, it is defeating its own
purpose.

The White House committee
does not so much deplore the feclv
mg among the town men that
the White House is their house;
rather it deplores the fact that
other students are looking upon
the White House as no longer
theirs, but as belonging to a sin-
glc group.

It is one of the objectives of the
Student Council to promote a bet-

lter and closer relationship between

the town men and the rest of the
student body It was an attempt
to achieve that purpose that
prompted the White House com-
mittee to permit the White House
to be used for open house on Fri-
day nights.

Instead of aiding this objective,
this open house has tended to iso-
late a group already too distant
from the campus social activities
held in the men’s halls on Friday
nights. And it is for this reason,
among others, that the committee
sees fit to exercise its privilege
in withdrawing a permission that
ltbas granted.

The White House committee be-
lieves that the town men’s open
houses have not been successful.
Attendance and campus support
have not warranted their continu-
ance. The town men have argued
that the White House would fur-
nish an opportunity for Grmneli
to have one place where a stag
line would be permitted. We do
not disagree with this objective,
but we deny its success, There can
be no stag line without Stags.

Furthermore, White House open
houses have tended to discourage
the use of the White House by
uou-deting students. The removal
of furniture from the lounge has
discouraged activities other than
dancing. The campus needs that
place where men and women can
get together to visit, smoke, 01‘
play cards, while more than hair
a dozen places on and around the
campus are open to dancing, Why
should the only place that nou-
dating or nonedancing students
can golthe White House lounge
ibc taken from them in order
that still anothEl' place may be
open for dancing?

We appreciate the care the
town men have given to the furnis
ture on Friday nights, but the
fact remains that moving furni-
iui-e can not help but incl-ease its
depreciation greatly, throwing a.
financial burden upon the student
body.

We are not antagonistic to the
interest and wellarc of the town
people, On the contrary, we earns
estly desire to have the town men
possess a strong organization, and
we also want them to accept the
hearty invitation to the activities
of the halls with which they are
associated. We want the town men
to be among us, parts of the
Grinnell campus in every possi»
his way.

At the some time, we want the
White House available for donor
ing (in the room provided) and
r, attractive, comfortable loungcl
dvailable at all times for all stu-
dents, except on occasional times
during the year when the town
men are welcome to use it for
parties.

TOWN MEN PETITION

We, the town men of Gl-innell
college, present the following per
tition to the Student Council in
the hope that it will revoke the
recent decision as set forth by
the White House committee With
reference to open house at the
White House on Friday evenings.
We believe we are justified in
taking our present stand for the
following reasons:

1. The White House was origin-
ally purchased as a Union build-
ing where students could meet for
social relaxation and recreation.

2. It is the only place on the
campus that lies the possibilities
of fostering stag dancing,

3. The open liouSe is open to
the entire student body.

4. It is gladly financed by the
town men in the hopes that it will
create a friendlier feeling between
the town men and the balls with
which they are associated,

5 The open house idea has not
had a fair enough trial period in
order to merit its discontinuance.

6. We have acted in accordance
with the wishes of the White
House committee in that we have
respected the Wlute House prop-
any and have cal-ed for it with
the best possible supervision.

7. That the student body as a
whole does not feel that an open
house influences them not to take
advantage of White House facilis
ties.

3. The open house program, as
budgeted by the town men, will
not allow more than 12 open
houses a semester.

9. The open house by the town
men has been approved by the
Council of House presidents. The
open house is in accordance with
the rules of the dormitory open
houses, and in accordance with
such will not function when othEr
halls are inactive and will be gov-
erned by the decisions of the
Council of House president:

10. The privilege of having an
open house puts a little meat on
an otherwise bare skeleton of a
town men's organization for which
we are extremely grateful.

OPEN FORUM

To the editor of the Scarlet and
Black:

Heal‘tiest congratulations are in
order for a Gnnnell student body
who has shown it has a. real cums
munity spirit. The recent decision
of the Student Council regarding
the White House open house ques
tion has proved to the entire school
that student government is fair
in its decisions, sincere in its
approval of attempts at campus
improvement, and as a body polls
tic upholds the ideals as set forth
by the principles of democracy.

The town men’s organization
has fostered a new Social idea
on the campus, which is intended
in a spirit of good will to the
entire student body. We are sin-
cerely sorry that a controversy
has arisen over the purpose of the
White House, but it has given the
town men the incentive to improve
mistakes and has nlade the cam-
pus realize that its White House
is now trying to offer it some-
thing new in the way of social
adjustment.

We therefore extend an invita-
tion to the entire campus to en-
joy the improved facilities of the
White House on Friday evenings.
By doing so, you will be indol‘sing
u movement which is now in its
trial stage.

Whether you want the open
house program at the White
House on Friday evenings depend
upon you. We look forward to
seeing you Friday night.
