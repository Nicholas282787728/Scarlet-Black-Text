rice there are a yariery of unfamiliar conrscs
offered by the Biology dcpartmsnr for the
upcoming school year There are some new
special topic courses beino offeled
by new professors as well as new
courses taught by existing profes-
sors,"said Nick Merkliu’08i These
classes come in large part from the
return ofsevelnl professors, as well
as the addition of new professors
The Biology depmtment will
be offering thrcc special topics next

Chair Vince Eckhart, Biology, Jackie Brown,

before, and Liz Qlleathom Biology. will teach
an aclyanccd special topics course on the corn-

Students me excited about the new course
additions. “I would
love to take compare

my schedule."said

to people who have
only taken lnrro [ro Biological Inquiry] also
sounds really neat, I think it's good for a dc»

While Mclissa Marks, Biology, will hc
leaving to do postdoctoral research at (he Unis
versity of Chicago, the Biology Department
looks forward to the return of other professors.
Tricia Hnrnphreys, Biology who had a once
year contract, has received a cm, at contract
extension, so she can till in fol L e Gregg
Jolly, Biology, who will be on sabbatical in
2007-2008. “Vida Ptaitis will be returning to
join as, having Completed her Harris Fellow
ship leaye,"soicl Eclshsrt.

The Biology department will be adding
two new professors. ”Benjamin DeRiddei' will
come to Grinnell as a new tenurestrack plant
biologist." said Eckhart, “and Shannon Hinsa
will join its as a new tenure-track rnicrobioloe
gist."

Metklin thinks these additions will
strengthen the entire Biology department.

 

Biology profs return and new ones enter the dept

“The returning faculty is pretty solid and the
addition of a new plant biologist should help
out the department, he said.

But despite these new additions, Biology
majors still have some qualms about the de-
partmcnt For the high number of Biology
majors here it would be logical to have a wider
variety ot’classes that can still help us to meet
the requirements," said Kelzee Tibbetts '10.
“The intro classes have a range of topics for
students to choose from and they vary by the
semester, and I think it would be a great op
portunity to be able to take classcs like those
all throughout my biology experience."

Merldin agreed. ”It would be nice if we
were oaerecl classes that were catered to [spee
ciﬁe] areas," he said,“but considering we are a
liberal arts college,1 know somcrirncs this is
hard to accomplish."
