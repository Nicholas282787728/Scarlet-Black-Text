A. C. P.'s Correspondenf

ddoammm’zocrfrrmuo a

do
Waslllngtolii (ACP) iMore than
a year ago the government said
it needed immediatee training of
college women to meet the den
mantls of war. As more men go
into the armed forces, the need
grows for women in various types
of war service. Here is the lips
tc-date stories of vacancies foi-
women todayAvacancies which
the government is trying hard to
fill.

in time of war, the armed
forces have the first claim on
men and women alike: But the
response of American women to
the call of the armed forces has
been, on the whole, a somewhat
sad one. Thousands of additional
recruits are needed, and some of
them, in terms of the woman-
powcr supply and demand, must
comes from our colleges.

The WAC has reported that on
January 1, 1544, its strength was

62,859 officers and enlisted wo-,

men. Linc that up against the
authorized strength of the WAC
—200,000 women, many of whom
are required for overseas serr
yice.

If you don't want to go over
seas, you can still release another
person for it. Recently the WAC
has been recruiting for specific
station assignments within this
country, It is now also permitting
candidates to apply for a spe-
cific job on the basis of their
previous experience. Qualified
college women who enlist in the
WAC have a good chance to be-
come officers and to continue
working in their major field at
a place of their own choosing.

The WAVES still need addi-
tional officer candidates, who
will be recruited from civilian
life, WAVE present strength is
nearly 50,000 women.’ It’s exn
pected to reach 100,000 by the
end of this year.

The Navy is now selecting col-
lege graduates more on the basis
of their ability to do certain
jobs than on the basis of gen-
eral personal qualifications, Al-
though the jobs for which per
sonnel is needed vanes from
time to time, you have a good
chance of finding a spot where
you can use your college major.

At present the WAVES greatest
needs are for aerologists, math-
ematicians, physicists, instructors
in air navigation, supply corps
officers and officers for medical
research.

The SPARS prefer college grade
uates with at least three years
of work experience. College wo-

POST-War Physical Training

A rigid postwar physical training
