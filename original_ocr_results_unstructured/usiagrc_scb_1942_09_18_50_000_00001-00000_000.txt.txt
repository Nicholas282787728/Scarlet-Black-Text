Failll Weis ls Named
Gadabouf Assisfdm‘
For Coming Season

Faith Weis, Haines, has been
named an assistant for the Cad—
ahout club, according to Paul
Bremicher, director, as he an—
aounoed club plans for the year
yesterday. So far, no man assis-
tant has been appointed. Ticket
sales for the Cadabout club will
be launched tomorrow at the col—
lege dining room entrance, he
said.

T‘VENI'Y FUNCHoNs

The tickets, which will be
handled by hall representatives,
cost four dollars, and they admit
the owner to twenty functions
during the year, making an av—
erage of twenty cents per Inner
tion.

If a holder is drafted at any
time during the year, he will be
refunded an amount equivalent to
the unused ticket value, Brem-
icker said. Arrangements are be,
ing made to include the officers'
training unit in Cadabouts, he
added, and this is hoped to malre
possible larger and better pro-
grams throughout the year.
COOPERATION NEEDED

Bremicker emphasized the nece
essity of practically one hundred
per cent subscription in order to
make Cadabouts succeed this
year. "Orchestras in medium
price ranges are very difficult if
not impossible to get," he Said.
“Plans for a varied program are
under way, and we are trying to
keep the quality of last year's
schedule."

The Gadabout club will
tinue such programs as Faculty
Follies, movies, roller skating,
magic shows, amature shows, and
hay and sleigh rides,
