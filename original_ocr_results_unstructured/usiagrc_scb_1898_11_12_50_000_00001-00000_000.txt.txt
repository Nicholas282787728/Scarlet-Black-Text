Ellis.

The Ellis program was very
pleasantly opened by one of our
honorary members, Mrs. Noble.
who favored the society with some
of the brighter carnivals of Schu-
mann. The last one was especialr
1y interesting in which was heard
the striking of the clock, the
whistle of the watchman and the
crowd dispersing to their homes.

The history of the Bering Sea
difﬁculties was clearly stated by
Mts. Moody, but she showeda
slight partiality to the claims of
the United States.

The extemporaneous work in-
dicated a carerul study ot current
events on the part of those spealtv
ing. but this is a phase of the so-
ciety work too much neglected by
a majority of the society as shown
by the failure of one member to
respond to the topit a 1». dher.
Miss. sr :h jpokc' of crrida and
Italy, emphasizing the weak
points in the Italian government
and the decline of Italian power.
Miss Swaney described the recent
festival of Lord Mayor's Day.

The tableaux of the afternoon
in charge of Miss Fltch served as
a pleasant introduction of several
new members of society work.
The scenes portrayed the history
and experiences of a typical
American youth as he grew in
patriotism and love of his country.
Misses McIntosh and Grenage
took important parts in the
scenes.

Dr. John Henry Barrows.

A crowded house greeted Dr.
Barrows last ever-ring, at the opens
ing lecture of the season's Y. M.
C. A. course. The subject of the
lecture was “A World Pilgrimage,
with Experiences Serious and not
so Serious,” and was a very intern
csting and instructive discourse.
His descriptions were very vivid,
and especially ﬁne was his word»
picture of the Taj Mahal. Dr.
Barrows spoke very highly of the
college and community. and es-
pecially of the nation. From all
his travels through Japan. China,
India and eastern islands. he has
returned to America, the best of
all nations.

S. U. I. vs. Grinnell.

Grinnell played the State Unis
versity football team a tie game
on the local grounds this after
noon, in a contest singularly dee
void of startlin sensational plays
which are so thrilling to the eyes
of the spectator. before the

ncll was crippled by the absence
of three regular lrlcn, every one
was predicting a sure victory for
the locals. biit they were content
to leave the ﬁeld with a tie, due
not so much to the ability of the
team, as to the kicking powers of
Wheeler.
