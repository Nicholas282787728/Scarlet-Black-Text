One of
engineering students

group during a recent map read,

tunity to be a hero by failing
to capture the miitt that suc-

cumbed to the musical charms of
Anne Brown. We expect him to

urday parade by placing him in—,

Pic. Melvin Green has assem-
bled a potent team for the fur-
therance of intramural basket-
ball and Volleyball. In their first
workout as a volleyball team,
the “Green Wave" set down two
different teams \15>7 and 15-3.

Sgt. Robert Maxweu's happy
face had the unhapby experience
of violently contacting a tumbl-
ing mat. We predict his facial
scars will heal more quickly than
those inner scars resulting from
the undignitied position in which
he fell. '
