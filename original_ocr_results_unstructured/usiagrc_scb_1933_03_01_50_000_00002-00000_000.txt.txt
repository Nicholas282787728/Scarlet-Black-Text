VARSITY SWIMMING

Grinllell’s swimming team has all imposing
record of four consecutive victories. including three
dual affairs alld team honors at the Midwest
A ALU. meet.

Such a record is a tribute to Coach Elton A.
Bosell and his team. Rigorous drill in fundamen-
tals and carefully observed training rules produced
team members who have the ability and reserve to
will not only one bllt several events against tough
competition. The team’s showing not only builds
up student spirit and morale but causes favorable
collllncnt throughout the state.

At the beginning of last semester. there was
some doubt as to whether Grinncll would have a
swimming team. A curtailed athletic schedule and
depleted treasul seemed to point toward the torn-
porary discontinuance of so-called millol- sport
Thr ugh the effort of team members and other
out do help was called in, with J. N, (Ding)
Darling, Des Moillcs Registcr cartoonist and Grin-
llcll trustcc. aiding to the largest extent in finance
ing this season’s Venture.

Now there are rumors that the same troubles
will be cxpcrienred next year and that there will
he no swimming team. In View of the facts that
the swilnlllillg‘ team has made such an excellent
showing: that most of its members will return next
year; that swimming is one of the lnost healthful
sports for participants and one of the most enjoy
able for spectators: that expenses of the sport are
not great, and that its all-around benefits are
grciltcr than its costs, we believe that varsity
swilllllling zit Grinucll college should be continued.

Other Opinions

ADVERTISING STATIC
(Minnesota Daily)

A new device threatens to revolutionize radio broad-
casting, It is a simple mechanism which automatically
turns radius on and off to eliminate advertising. Broad-
casters may stare askance at this, to them, “Snake in
the grass" invention. But if it comes into practical use
it will only give many broadcasters their just deserts.

When the Federal Radio commission grants a li-
cense to a station it grants a virtual monopoly for that
wave length for a range of a hundred miles or more. This
monopoly is comparable to that of a public utility which
runs trolly lines, steam rails, or power or gas mains
through a community. Public utilities go through the
form of promising something such as service in return.
But a radio station does nothing of the kind. A. license
is granted without charge and the broadcaster can pro-
ceed to present entertainment tinged with merit or pme
ceed to sell ballyhoo, a commodity with an attractive
margin of profit.

It costs the government about $500,000 yearly to
allocate and administer the separate ether monopolies.
The half million is saddled upon the taxpayer who ale
ready, in an effort to filter some inspiration or amuse
ment out of his machine, is hearing the burden of ad-
Vel‘tlsing blasts demanding, “Why don't you buy Bel-n-
yard Biscuits as we need the money?"

Citizens are inclined to lay the abuse of radio to
the youth of the business, and hope that in time, the
evils will be corrected. There is no cause for such hope
On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that
the broadcasting fellows will go the road of other big
businesses, and that, as far as the consumer is concerm
ed, present conditions will only go from bad to worse. As
the broadcasting interests become more and more ine
volved in large capital investments for stations, they
will become more and more entrenched in congress
through the indirect and sometimes direct weight of
their numbers and the dollars they ropresent

Public utilities, railroads, arms manufacturers and
other especial interests have to maintain an influence
over local and national governing bodies by lobbying and
other devices. The necessity of paying dividends comes
before considerations of ethics, honesty or other none
economic factors. Time, then, cannot hope to eliminate
the faults of the American broadcasting system.

HOIST THE Honors PDDGE
(The Daily Northwestern) .

This editorial will arouse the antagonism of many
of the present day campus "big Shots." It will advocate
the abolition of the Student Council, class officers, and
the present hodge podge system of activities. It will ask
for the centralization of all student activities, the plac-
ing of responsibility where it can be handled, and the
maintenance of a mature attitude towards our extran.
eous curriculum.

Such an idea calls for the arbitrary division of the
extant system into five groups; the division of religious
activities, the men's group, the women’s, social and fin-
ancial. Over these would be a senior governoring board
composed of the retiring junior heads of the five groups.
Within these five divisions would be the various suhe
committees composed of underclassmen and headed up
by sophomores and juniors.

Of course, this plan means a revolutionary change.
The student council will no longer have any hypothetical
function to perform as there will be no election of class
officers. The err—social chairmen can find a place in the
division of social activities. The treasurers can really go
to work in the financial group. All the men will eo-oper-
ate in their di on as will the women in theirs. The
solely religious organizations will also have a group
division,

The unit of publications has not been mentioned as
it is already highly centralized and kept under responsi-
ble control.

We do not present such a conception as a panacea
for collegedom. This plan will require careful working
out by both the administration and the student body.
However, it will substitute order for chaos and responr
sibility for "passing the buck."

COLLEGIATE OYNICISM
(Nebraska Weslyiin)

“The modern student is in a great part justified for
the cynical ltnd critical attitude he assumes toward pres
eut-rlay society," Herbert E, Hawkes, dean of Columbia
univcr ty, says in his annual report to Dr. Nicholas
Murray Butler. ”This attitude is in a measure respon-
sible for the general rise in intellectual standards and
collegiate curricula,” he adds.

“It is to he expected that in time when the ade-
quacy of the entire structure of our economic order it
called in question, young men should be in a disturbed
state of mind. When the actual situation that one meets
every day is a criticism of the fore-thought and judge
mont of the earlier generation, It is not surprising that
youth should go on a mild dchauch of everything in
sight."

. .Hnwkes' report is surely a truism. students have
a right to be critical today, if ever they had the right,
And why not? The president of Bcrea college in Kerr
Lucky recently made the statement that sending college
students out into the cold, cold world is “like throwing
naked babies into the Atlantic ocean." If Such be true.
can one blame the cynical attitude?
