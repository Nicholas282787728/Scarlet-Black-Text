Bromide Council Outlines DrimlitLic
Program For YearﬁAsks For
Student Referendum.

Officials of Lhe hialtcaser promise
the prize issue for next time, in the
form of a Homecoming number with
innumerable features. The four color
front cover drawn by s. Eyed-ins
gives the book a flashy appearance.
ilore art work than ever before is he-
ing used, and the quality of the humor-
is excellent. .

As the book will not appear until
the day of the Arnes game, it will also
serve partially as a program for the
game, featuring the lineup, photos of
the captains and coaches of the two
teams.

The tchtative plan for a season tickr
at system including all dramatic ierr
ductions of the year was vetoed by the
Dramatic council, Tuesday afternoon
because the students have failed to re-
spond to the suggestion. The plan
will bc considered again in the spring,
as the Council believes the students
did not have sufiicieut time to con-
sider the qeustion.

it was decided that a committee -
mods up one member from each of the
eight societies will have charge of the
College Revue. The College Revue
is to take the place of the literary so-
ciety plays given each year and all
societies will take part,

In place of the other so-
ciety play the faculty will stage one,
an event which occurs once in four
YGHS.

Two plays will he put on by the coir
iege Dramatic club, and these, as well

. as the other two productions, will be
staged in the Colonial theatre.

Three productions will be given by
the class in dramatic production, un-
der Mrs. Hallie Mohegan These plays
.win be given in the auditorium in A.
R. H.

The regular admission charge for
the downtown plays is $1.51) and ior
the campus plays .50. This would
make a total of $7.50 if one were to
attend all of the productions. By the
proposed plan season tickets could be
bought for $5, with the proviso that if
the student did not wish to attend a
certain play, he could sell his ticket.

A list of the plays was posted On
the bulletin board of each cottage on
Monday, with a space left vacant for
the names or those in favor of the new

"idea. The number of students sisn-
ing the papers prior to the council
meeting Tuesday afternoon was far be-
low the three hundred mark set as the
minimum necessary for the successful
carrying out of the plan.

The triangular cross country meet
between Drake, Amos and Grinnell,

will take place over the Ames, course,
instead of at Dcs'ltfoin‘es, as originally
planned. Itl will begin at 1:45 pan,

Ames’ football clash with the Kansas
Aggles, at Manhattan.

The dopesheet does not pic Grln<

Drake-AmeSrOklahoma triangular last
Saturday.

DELEGATES PRESENT
SDNEEENDE IDEALS

Speakers Advocate Broader Social
, Life, “Thoughtful Progressl ism”
mill Studeihi-Fiimllty Groups.

The inspiration received by the
Crinnell people who went to the con-
fcrence [at Des Moines last week end
was passed on to the student body-
Tuesday morning in one of the first
student chapels of the year.

"Thoughtful progressivlsm should
be our attitude in helping solve the
world problems,” was the ideal Har-
rlet Cathc‘art presented.
to get the right iuiﬁative and to ape
ply it at the right time and place
should be sought. Miss Cathcart said
the people who addressed their meet»
ings were characterized by what we
usually call radicalism. Sherwood
Eddy upheld the ideal of protection by
love rather than resistance even in
meeting national invasion. Mr. Hap-
good outlined the policy he had adopt—
ed of turning his factory, entirely over
to the management of his employees.

Suggest Get-Togethers

A greater exchange of ideas between
the men and women on the campus was
felt by the delegates to be a problem
at Crinnell. Neil Crone outlined some
lsuggesiions which they wished the
student body to consider. These in-
cluded meetings of senior men and
‘womcn on Sunday nights for discus~
siou of live topics, entertainment of
small groups in faculty homes, and
some affairs where the girls should
ask men for dates.

A need was also felt for a greater-
cxchangc of ideas between faculty
members and students. Philip Katm-
discussed suggestions proposed by the
delegates to mcct this problem. Meek

Smith Hall ..
Building Three
Clark Hail .
Langan Hail .
Building Four

By virtue of their 74 victory over
IAngan hail Tuesday, and Smith hall's
13—6 defeat at the hands of Clark Hail
Monday, Dibble Hall is now in the
undisputed lead for the speedbail
championship.

The greatest upset of the dope
came Monday when Clark Hall, twice
previously defeated, trimmed the
undefeated Smith Hall crew by a 13—6
count. However, the score does not
indicate the relative strengths of the
teams, for the battle was evenly con-
tested throughout. Two ﬁeld goals
by W. Patton, a ﬁeld goal and a pass
by Tiiton, and a pass by Frankel,
spelled defeat for Smith; while a ﬁeld
goal by Thornton, a free kick by P.
Reed, and a pass by Campbell, ac.
counted for Smith's points. W. Pct-
ton and Captain Tliton played bril-
liantly for Clark, while Thornton and
Campbell were the individual stars for
Smith.

On Tuesday, Dibble Hall scored a
7-2 win over Langan Hall in a rough
and tumble battle. Both teams fought
hard, with the result that the playl
became rather violent at times. The
defensive play of both teams was the
feature of the game, although Dibble’s
offense worked much smoother, and‘
more consistently. Three missed by
Pcderson, and a drop kick by Henry‘
cousiitutcd DiblllC’s scoring; while a
pass by WKJOHQS accountcd frir La -l
sau's\2 points. Pcdcrson, chry, and

SPEAK HENE SATDDDAY

Distinguished Cheniislv to Leetlme on
“file Fall of Energy itud The
Rise of Maui.”

One of the most noted lecturers in
America, Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, chem:
‘ist, author, educator, editor, will (lea
lliver an address Saturday evening in
i-Icrrick chapel on the Subject: “The
Fall of Energy and the Rise of Mao."

Dr. Slossun is one of the most dis-
‘tinguishcd men in science and liter-
ature today. Probably his ”Chats on
Science” and his uCreative Chemistry"
are his most popular works, although
he has written many other books and
treatises, invaluable in the fields of
Science, particularly chemistry. At
the present time, he is director of
Science Service at Washington D. C..
an organization established for the
dissemination of scientific imforma-
(ion to the public.

Speaks Clearly

His lecture subject: "The Fall of
Energy and the Rise of Man" is a sub-
ject of vital interest. it is, for the
main part, on application of the funda-
mentai laws of energetics to the ques-
tion of the progress and limitations of
civilization, and Dr. Siosson is a
man who thoroughly understands the
subject, and who gets his ideas across
to the audience with amazing clear-
uess.

The lecture will begin at 3 o'clock.
Semester fees will admit.

Sive practice of the last ten days. With

most every night, the Pioneers have
been primed for the encounter, and
the Kohawks may rest assured that
they have a real battle on their hands
Saturday.

Before a Homecoming crowd, one

backs. Captain Critchett, who tore
the ligaments of a shoulder last year.
again suffered the same injury last
week, and it is doubtful whethep he
will don a suit. His loss will be off—
set in a manner by the return of Wood,
who, may get back into his old tackle
position in the game Saturday. In
the scrimmage the fore part of the
game, Howarth at tachle, and Gates
and C. Kingery at helfbacks have
shown up especially well, and it is
more than likely that some of ihein
will be given an opportunity to show
their wares against Coe. In the ab—
senee of Captain Critchett, hiceter and
Moran will take care of the punling,
with Meeter doing the drop-kicking.

Passes Improve

The passing game has improved
considerably this week and the team
seems to have more drive. The de—
fense is functioning very well as evi-
deueed by the fact that on Monday of.
ternoon, when the preps were given
the ball for 25 consecutive downs, the
varsity intel‘bepted a pass on the 25th
down at practically the same spot
where the props had started out. The
men are following the bail better, the
interference is smoother, and the tack-
ling has shown a marked improvement
of late.

Altogether, this week's play seems
to ini‘llcate that the Pioneers are in
mid—season farm, and that Grihhell
followers have grounds for being op-
timistic over the outcome of the Coo
same.
