A defeated army is one which has
lost everything, including its honor,
to its victors. A deteated team is one
which quits, lays down on its job.

Just because the score was 7 to 0
against us do not think for a moment
that we were defeated Saturday. The
team never laid down once but fought
every minute of the game. They really
played a wonderful game. Although
handicapped by the lack of a practice

societies had ii place in Giiniicii col-

to ”beat the game,” and pay the lowest price; you’ll get
poor quality; the Clothes won’t last and your “High Cost

Here’s the right way; get good quality; pay for it;
