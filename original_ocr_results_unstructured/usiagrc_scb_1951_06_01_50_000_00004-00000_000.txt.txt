Marjorie Dewel, president oil
this year's senior class, is an ele
cinentary education major from
Algona, iowa.

Marge, as s ic's known to
everyone on campus, lives in‘
Main hall and is a Battle laoaroll1
member, After graduation, she
has hopes of finding a job as a
second grade elementary teacheI
or. possibly in Cedar Rapids.

Better than anything else,
Marge likes to swim. She was a
member of White Caps, the swim
club for three years and was
a life guard at the Algona pool
for two summrrs. Tennis is also’
lrgh on Mai-go's list of favorite»
sports.

“I've gone out for assorted
hall intramurals," says Margc,i
“but I wasn't very good i any
of them." This seems to be cone
tradicted by Mai-go's election to:
the presidency of the Women's‘
Honor G last May.

Marge stems from ,a long liner
oi newspaper people, her grand-‘
:iathcr and father being publish-
ers and editors of the Kossuth
County Advance, Algonzi's only
newspaper. Marge has‘ always
lind a secret yen to write chil—
dren‘s books. She feels that shot
might be qualified since she hasl
majored in English and minored
in history and science, to com-
plete her education require-
ments.

Summer plans include an
eastern vacation with specialf
emphasis on visiting New Eng-
land and work on her new
hobby, sewing.
