 

College Must Face
Assault Within

Community

Acquaintancc rape has become an issue of growing concern on many
college campuses across the country, but does it happen here at Grinnell?
Most students tend to answer “no.“ Although there have been several
rapes/attempted rapes reported in the Grinnell community, none of the
assailants mentioned in the all-campus mailings and Mcmo notes were of
college age. All were older males, presumably from outside the campus
community. Yet according to Heather—Jean Pyle, a memberofthc Mental
Health Center's sexual abuse support group, there have been at least ﬁve
cases of acquaintance tape reported on campus this year. Why have these
cases of rape have not been reported to the campus community?

The answer to this question can be found in the Student Affairs policy
of handling cases of sexual assault A survivor of sexual assault may
report the incident to Student Affairs, the police, or both. It choosing to
take action through Student Affairs, the survivor of a sexual assault can
submita written complaint to the Student Affairs Office, upon which s/he
is told to keep matters concerning the case private. A President’s
Committee is then formed to conduct a “trial, and the Victim is invited to
make a recommendation on what should be done in the event the accused
is found guilty. The accused, who is told to keep the incident a private
matter as well, has an opportunity to make a statement in his/her defense.
Once the case has been decided, names of the persons involved remain
confidential.

Several improvements can be made in the way acquaintance rape is
handled by the Student Affairs Office. First, if town assaults are made
public. why is the same not done with rapes that occur on campus? The
Student Affairs Ofﬁce should report the number of sexual assault cases
that are brought before it and the outcome of these cases, just as the
Judicial Council does with the cases it hears at the end of each semester.

that sexual assault does take place. Perhaps this knowledge would force
the campus to confront the issue and prevent further incidents from taking
place. Secondly, survivors should be immediately informw about the

Curiouser and Gurinser
Say No to Political Affiliation

I used to believe that this was a
college. [thought that meantpeople
came here to get an education.
However. it seems I was wrong.
Grinnell the college is a hoax. The
truth be known, Grinnell is a front
for a political club.

I don't know how this grand gag
began. I truly believe that in the
beginning this place was a college.
Perhaps, like any number of good
ideas, a few people. in an effort to
make it better, screwed it up. I‘d
like to think that’s what happened,
mostly because I‘d like to think
people are basically honest. What
ever started, the fact exists that the
Grinnellstudentpopulationis more
and more frequently being used for
political ends.

I first realized this fact at an
initiative vote a while back. Like
mostGrinncllians I read initiatives
on my way through the post office
(even though. unlike most. I vote).
One particular proposal regarding

By Jordan Magill

reproductive rights caught my eye.
While I did not disagree with the
statement, I really did not
understand what its purpose was.
Wassomeonesimply pollingtofind
out ifa majority ofGrinnellians are
prorchoice? It seemed silly. I
simply did notvotc. ltwas not until
a few days later that someone
explained to me that the initiatives
could be used to write letters to
politicians on the behalf of the
student body. I was not amused.

I always thought the purpose of
initiatives was to decide how
students felt regarding issues
directly effecting the campus.
“Should Grinnell serve tuna?"
“Should Grinnell divest?" “What
should Grinnell’s housing policy
be?" This initiative was a whole
new ball game. What it did, eilher
for reasons ofeffectorexpcdicncy,
was to lake the CHOICE of which
side of this issue a particular
Grinnellian was on,andlutnpthcm
with the majority. It stole the
minority's basic right of dissent.
For no longer were they at Grinnell
for an education, now they were
hercforafarmorcinsidiousreason:
to serve the majority's political
ends. Simply because they had
chosen to come here for an
education, the minority had been
forced to hold an opinion that some
may have found morally
reprehensible.

So much for the Bill of Rights.
Somuch fortherightsofaminority
to express itself. So much forcivil
rights.

Some by now are probably
wonderingwhyl’mmakinganissue
outofthisnow. ltis notjustbccausc
I had nothing else to write about
this week.

You probably know from siting
on the toilet in your dorm that a
proposal was made to joint board

that Grinnelljoin a students lobby
called USSA. In addition to
supponing educational rights, this
lobby hasalaundrylistofpolitically
correct stances on its platform.

Iagree with most ofthcpositions.
The idea ofGrinnelI joining makes
me sick to my stomach. I've been
told that I‘m being a reactionary;
that joining USSA will allow
Grinnellto“makeadifference"and
to “be heard."

Boys and girls. we do make a
difference. Atleastmany of us do.
We give of our time, and of
ourselves,sothatwecanhclpothers.
To say that this is the only way
Grinnell can makea difference is to
belittle those of us who try. Our
voices are heard. We write letters,
wc travclfarand widetomarchand
to speak, and we are heard.

And to those who say that it will
enrich the campus, I say there must
be a way of doing that while
maintaining the integrity of the
minority. I do not believe anyone
can go out and lobby for all 1250
people on this campus. And I have
to tell you, if someone could, this
would be a rather boring place. It
does not matter how many
in atives you hold or how large a
majority you get. if one person on
this campus dissents, then we have
committed a travesty. We, as the
majority, have used their desire for
an education for our own political
ends, becoming the oppressor so
many of us despise.

If one wishes to enrich the
campus with diverse ideas and give
organizations the opportunity to
reachout, I say more power to them.
Provide funding so organizations.
no matter what their political
tendency, can go off campus to
conventions where they enrich us
and enrich themselves. Do net,
however, send someone in m y name
for I am unwilling to stand silent
while the majority steals anyonc’s
right to choose.
