Hampton Exchanges Spend Exciting Semes’ce

By Jan Reinke

Nostalgic but enlightened, three of us Grinnellians have re-
turned to the corneand-hog stronghold after an exciting and prof-
itable semester as Hamptonians, exchange students in a project
"to promote understanding and good Willbetwecn Negroes _and
whites through the medium of actual participation in college life."

The three are Bob Holloway,
Nick Piediscalzi, and myself,
juniors.

Spring in January

When we left Grinncll in Jan-
uary, it was snowy and coldr It

seemed miraculous to see greenl

grass and spring ﬂowers at
Hampton. We did have snow,
but it Was nothing like Winter
in Iowa

Himylon Institute is locat-
ed at Hampton, Virginia. It’s
in potential atom-bomb target
area, in case of war, because
Langley field, Norfolk Naval
Base, Fort Monroe, and the
Newport News shipyards are
all within a 20-mile radius.
At Hampton, instead or the
M&SLL., we had jet jobs
zooming overhead.

The Hampton campus is beau»
tiful. Along one side of the
campus is the waterfront which,
on sunny afternoons, resembled
Merrill Park. It was out-of-
bounds for women after sun-
down, however. The water
which fronts the campus is
Hampton creek. which eventual-
ly goes into the Hampton Roads.

Small fishing boats chug past
the campus into Hampton her-
bor, which is a center of the
lsoftrshell crab and oyster in.
dustries, Big smelly piles of
.oyster shells vouch for that——
‘when the wind is in the right
direction, the whole campus gets
{a whiff of the aroma.
Dormitory System

Like Gtinnell. the men aren‘t
:assigned to dorms on the basis
‘of classification. Nick lived in
homes hall, one oi whose main
{claims to fame is that it's a
hunter—mile trek from the din-
,ing room. Bob lived in Wigwam,
,s. dorm with an interesting his-
ltory. At one time, Hampton had
‘Indlan students, ,representing
three hoslile tribes. In order to
prevent bloodshed. Wigwam
was built in three separate sec-
tions. Although it looks like one
building from the outside, men
living on third or second floor
must go downstairs, and then go
back upstairs in order to visit
a neighbor living in another
section of the dorm.

l

 

l lived in Cleveland hall, the
sophomore women’s dorm. All
women students are assigned to
dorms by classification.

Activities

The three oi us had two
classes together. Otherwise, we
saw each other and the other
four exchange students only
brieﬂy on campus. Bob was ac-
tive with the Student Christian
association which initiated Sat—
urday afternoon square-dancing
this year. He was also a mem—
ber of Men of Hampton,
glee club. Nick and I were both
members of the Institute chapel
choir. Nick was a member of
Les Auteurs, literary club.

Our main complaint about
Hampton was the food. With
