turn them when he goes on his hunting
trip and this will be their last appear-
ance in civilization.

The company's representative in la
pan has secured Professor San Sen Yu-
catan and his famous troupe of acro-
bats to come to the United States for
this date only, and arrangements have
been made with the ferryan on the
River Styx to convey across all who so
desire in order that they may get a
glimpse of the Devil and his angels as
they actually live. The only wild man
in e stance has been captured for this
exhi on, the tallest and shortest men
alive will be there. There will be
plenty of good stuff to eat, balloon as
oensions, cane racks, “nigger bobv"
racks, fortune tellers, rubber return
balls, confetti, pink lemonade, et cetera
ad nauseam.

Last but not least a brass band Sousa
never heard of, will furnisll music
throughout the entire performance.
The grounds open at 7:30 pm, and the
admission is only ﬁfteen cents. The
management wish to announce that
“this is a. strictly clean and moral
show, and one to which you can bring
your wives and sweethearts” without
fear of anything distasteful being pre
sented.

Grinnell Will inset her two old tilne
rivals on the cinder path again this

sesaon. On May ﬁrst the scarlet and

black will journey to Des Moines to
meet the Drake runners, while at the
middle of the month Ames will visit
Grinnell. These two duals, With the
state and conference meet, will cornr
plate the College track schedule. Pre-
liminary to these meets the annual
dual between the underclassmen and
the Home meets will be held. This
program promises as strenuous a sea-
son ror the aspirants on track and
ﬁeld. The meets with Anne: are al-
w vs close and exciting, while this
year Drake should put up a better
ﬁght than they have in the lost three
years. The state meet will he a ﬁght
from the ﬁrst with chances about even
for Ames, Drake and Grinnell.

The schedule will be as follows:

April 17 —— Freshnlaanollllomore

Baseball is already beginning to
loom up big on the horizon and be
fore another week has passed, the mu
sioal thud of the batted horse-hide
sphere will be a familiar one in the
men’s “g: m." if present plans hold out.
With the election of a captain new m~
terest has pervaded this line oi work

more active outdoor u-orl: which should

begin within a few weeks.
Barber plans to put those men who
are eligible for varsity team at work
in the cage immediately. Those who
are ineligible will not be worked in
the cage as the limited accommodd
tiops will not permit it, but will be
given a chance for practice when the
outdoor season starts. This notice is
of interest:

“All men in Iowa College who
are eligible for the ’i'nrsity team
are requested to meet at the Gym-
nasium office Monday offer-noon at
4:15, to make arrangements for
beginning work. it is important
that every man whom this notice
includes be present.

Captain.

The football schedule is now being
made up, although the deﬁnite dates
cannot as yet he announced, Tentative
dates have been made With Drake,
Amos and. Cornell, and these games
are practically assured. In addition
games will be scheduled as in years
past with the smaller schools of the
state. Nebraska, a ﬁxture on the Sche-

 

dule for some few Years. and Cl’eiglb
ton, an acquisition of this year, will

not be lnet. The management feels

that the long trips are rather a detri»

men: than a help to the men.

But tuo more games remain on the

basketball schedule. Drake and Des

Moirles v. M. C. A. Grinnell should
win the Drake. game without great
difﬁculty, although the blue and white
will undoubtedly but up a hard ﬁght

on their own somewlilat limited floor.
The Y, \i. c. A. game should be a hard
one. Gl'inllell has always had if good
deal of trouble in trying for this game.
The Des Moines men have been, in the
past, invincible on their own ﬂoor.
From the showing earlier in the sea
son Grinnell should stand a good show
of winning, howeven

More men are wanted for the cross
country squad. Thus far but very few
men have turned out regularly. At
Drake a big sound are reporting every
day. In past years the distance men
of Grinnell have won but very few
points. if this season is to be any
different it will take some work now,
to make it so.

ﬁlJTlllllE LECTURES

Noted Saciologixt Talked Illsh‘uctib'ely
Otl Ute Lnborlng .Vall, His Cozldl- '
tum and H15 Futlil‘e.

Last night at Hei'l'ick chapel, Dr.
William B. Guthrie, Professor of Sir
ciology at the College of the Cityof
New York, addressed a handful of the
faithful upon the subject, “The Man
With the Hoe.” Dr. Guthrie told how
well Millet's picture typiﬁes the labor-
ipg‘man as he has been in the past,
Without organization of any SDI‘t or
common interest in the common good,

This man with the hoe has been and
will he one of the great problems of
mankind. He must be brought into a
sympathetic and helpful relatinn‘with
the rest of humanity. The laborer's
position in society has changed, At
ﬁrst he was below society, then on
the outside of it and now the relation
which is Comnig about will make him
a necessary and vital part of society.

Mr. Guthrie spoke of the power the
laborer has, and the dependence which
society feels upon him under the pres
ent great industrial and machine op-
erated civilization. He mentioned the
growth and development of the trade
union system through its suppressed
period, when it was held down by is-
gal restrictions, the militant period a
few years ago when the union was
too ready to assert its power by a
strike, and the conciliatory period on
which We are just entering.

Mr. Guthrie believes that there is
trouble ahead in the solution of this
great problem, and he urges ﬁrst of
all education of all the children 01 to-
day and a careful directing of the vote
of the great cities, for the vote of the
city \l ill come more and more to domi-
nate the entire state, Along With this
political education must be religion.
Tlle laboring man must live out the
precepts of the Greatest Friend of the
Tailoring man, for Without Christian-
ity behind it, the labor organization
cannot be most efﬁcient and permanent.

The attendance at Dr. Guthrie's lee:
ture was very low, especially in view
of the sort of man he is and the great

1- and common interest which attaches

to the subject. Those present showed
a keen interest in the lecture from
start to ﬁnish, as the applause at his

conclusion plainly testiﬁed.
