Post War Building Schedule
Biggest in College History

Science Hall.
Healih Cenier
Plans Ok'cl

Plans for a post-war building
program larger than any-
thing scheduled in Grinnell
college history were outlined
Wednesday by President
Samuel N. Stevens after his
return from a conference in
Chicago with the college‘s
consulting architect.

First project on the calendar
is the erection of a new science
building at the north of A. R, H.,
to house the hiology, chemistry,
and physics departments.

Simultaneously with this huild-
ing, a new student health center
will he erected on campus on a
site not yet chosen.

Both these buildings have been
imically approved by the board
of trustees, and funds have been
assured to the college by undis-
closed persons.

Blair Hall will be dismantl-
ed as soon as the science
building is complete, Stevens
said. A group of three build—
ings housing music, speech
and drama departments and
providing, in a separate

 

structure, an auditorium and
theater, will be constructed
in the south campus area
now occupied by Magoun
Hall, Blair, and the present
music building, all of which

will be torn down.
This will he the focal point of

the campus, and the new build—
ings will be approached by a cir—
cular drive from Eighth street
to the railroad trucks along high-
way six. The entire south cam»
pus will be re-landscaped.

These plans also have been ap-
proved by the trustees, but no
financial commitments made.

With Magoun hall dismantled,
administrative offices of the col-
lege will be moved to what is now
Carnegie library.

A'n entirely new type at library

is the plan of the future. All an-
):‘ex will he built to the present
building with air-wilditioned
rooms {or litre storing of mien-m
film.
“By the end of this war, micro
film will be sufficiently develops
ed so that new hooks will he
photographed and films of them
will be stored in a fraction of the
space now required for regulao
sized volumes," Stevens said.

“Grinnell’s new library will he
built to accommodate such ma—
terial. In the annex individual
desks and the apparatus necessary
for protection of microfilm will

he provided.

“The present stacks and up-
stairs reading rooms of Camegie
library will he used for reading
rooms and storage of our pres<
ent stock of books.”

War or No War—

Honor "6" Sticks to Queens

The Gadahouts can have their
kings and glamour boys, but the
Honor "0" club still remains true
to the fairer sex, William Findley,
the lettermen's dance chairmen,
announced last night.

He stated that the highlight of
the club's Homecoming hall Satur—
day night would he the presenta-
tion of this year's Honor “G"
sweetheart.

Findley reported that Earl Haw
ward and his 11 piece orchestra
from lowa city have been signed
to furnish the music for the dance,
and that the maestro is scheduled
to start Waving his haton prompt—
ly at 9 tomorrow.

"Although this is the first time
Howard’s hand has appeared on
the campus, he has built up a fine
reputation throughout eastern
Iowa,” he said.

——For Homecoming

An air of mystery hangs over
the theme of Saturday night’s
festivities, but Findley warned
dancers not to be surprised to fmd
the women’s gymnasium trsns-

rormed into a miniature football
field. complete with footballs, goal
posts, henches. side-line markers,
and referees.

Speaking of service men, Find—
ley stated that a special rate has
been made tor them, adding that
the monogram organization wishes
to extend a cordial invitation to
all men in uniform and their dates
to attend the dance. ‘

He urged students who have not
yet purchased tickets to contact
any Honor “o" man, as an extra
fiity cent levy will he added to
the present charge at the gate
Saturday evening.

Officially, the Homecoming
program begins tomorrow
with Pres. Samuel N. Stev—
cns’ address in alumni chapel
at 11 a. in. Most alumni are

expected to be on campus by
that time to begin the weekend

besides
the traditional Honor

festivities which include,
the game,
‘G' dance; a farewell address by
Dr. Cecil Faiz'ficld Lavel, retiring
protcsspr of philosophy; open
house for alumni in all halls and
cottages, and the running of a
cross country meet by Grinnell,
Cornell and Navy Pre-flight
teams.

Dorothy Mnynor, celehrated
American soprano, will present a
concert in Herrick chapel Sunday
afternoon at 3:30, and the tra—
ditional liturgy for the home-
coming vesper service will he
transferred to the college church
period on Sunday morning to ac—
commodate the concert.

Missing from this year's sched-
ule of events is the Homemming
play and the Hon‘or to.) nlunmi
dinner and smoker. Both may he
termed “casualties" of a sort in
Grinnell’s adapmtion to war con-
ditious. A. It. H. auditorium is
now in use by 0. o. 5. number
two‘s candidates and officers, and
the quadrangle dining hall, al-
ready ammnodating nu menaiid
women students of the college
cannot handle a separate alinnni
dinner.

otherwise, the 1942 Homecomr
ing has retained all the star
features of other years, and has
added one military note. Coin-

Indications are that only slum-

With all college students and
