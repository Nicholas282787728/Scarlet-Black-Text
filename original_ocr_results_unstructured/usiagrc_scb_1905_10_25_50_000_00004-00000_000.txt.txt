llowever, the college has responded
to the increased knowledge in the
world, and has introduced other sub-
rects, tentatively at iii-st it muvhe,
but linaliy giving them coor mute
rain: with Mathematics. Greek and
Latin. In the ccuvseoieduculionul ovo
lotion and experience weliarc comelo
recognize at least eleven sublects as
basal in higher education. it is prob-
able that no college can be callcd
strong that does not make adequate

provision {01 the [catching OI all LllBSe,

suhyects. They are, MrtLheiiinbics.
Greek, Latin, English, Modern Lang-
uago, History, Philosophy. Palm 1
Science, Physics, Chemistry and Biol-
ogy. Other subjects that will readily
occur-lo anyone are desirable. butit
isstill quite possible to liaveaguorl
college with only the eleven siihyccts
provided for. E21011 of the subjects
demands the entire Lime of One Leach—
er, and it follows that in a good col-
lege there cannot be [ewer than eleven
teachers devoting their time £0601»
loge work.

if the college has no preparatory
school, so that elementary Greek
and Modern Language, which the
high schools so often fail to provide,
must he taught in the college, then
there should be another teacher in
each of those departments.

Dr. Holmesonce said of acercain Col-
lege that its professors uid not occupy
chairs: they had settces, by which, of
course. he meant that. each had to
Leach two or three Subjects. When-
everyounnd in a. college catalogue
that one professor has Chemistry and
Physics, another Latin and Greek,
another History and Political science,
you may safely conclude that the
teaching in that college is not strong.
The Same is true when a consider-
able number or college teachers do
also the academy work in their re-
spective subjecm, and this is very
common. _

The reasons for the above state
ments are obvious. Few men know
enough about two subjects to teach
them well in a college. A ﬁrst rate
teacher must llavanlarge amounbof

knowledge in order to have a true
perspective and keep in touch lliih
the advance of his subject. lie call-
nOL keep eien insight orthe advance

The second reason is that one

cver, that the sludeut who so desires,
ioulri h- etiio opportunity to spec-

ol his college course: Limb ls, he should
have the opportunity to take aboiiL
ﬁfteen yeanllours in Cl n e Subject}.
This amount; 01' work is about the
llmiu of one man’s teaching capacity
and hence the necessity ol :ttlcast one
teacher to one department. it is not
rare, by the way, to ﬁnd college teach-
ers in an institution doing from
eighteen to twenty-ﬁve hours of work.
In such cases we may be sure that
either the teachers are seriously over-
worked, or that the instruction is of
an inferior grade.

But there are teachers and (ranchers.
While it is sumetimes true than an
academically well-prepared man is a.
failure as a teacher, it is generally
true that those who are best prepared
are the mosh emcienh teachers. In
the olden days it was quite customary
even in the best. colleges to elect men
who had jusu graduated from college
to positions on the faculty, find even
as rull professors. Unfortunately the
cnsmm is all We prevalent yen in the
weaker colleges. In this particular,
howevnl’i than has been a great gain
in the lush score of years. The Amer-
ican system of graduate work is bor-
rowed from the German universities
and Its development has taken place
almosn entirely Within chat. period.
In recent years it has supplied a suf-
ﬂclency of well-prepared teachers.
