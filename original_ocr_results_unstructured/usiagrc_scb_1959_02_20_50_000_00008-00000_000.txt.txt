Women To Vole dh Hours. ‘
New W_ay To Improve Budget Flu Shots Tuesday

by Kathie

Howell

In the mass meeting of all women students tolbe held Mond'a!

evening following dinner, women

\K‘Ill rate all the adontion cl :1

rcvl<ion of the AWS conslitlltton abolishing the mass meetings
held eltuh semester to approve the AWS budget. They will also

vote on the proposed change in
tend them to 12 midnight cvcl‘y

The byelaw ol the constitution
(Article 111, Section I, c. l)
which statcs tho lunction of tho
women’s Social Budget commit.
Lec new 1 dds: “to prepare \K‘llll’
in the first month of the col-
logo year a budget tov be rec-
ommondcd to the Associated
Women Students to covcr thc
fiscal year from October 1 to
October 1. This budget shall be
submitted to the entire Assoe
ciation ior their approval.”

it is propuscd that this or-
ti'cle be revised to read, as
follows; “to prepare, with the
upproval of the AWS Board,
within the tirst month of each
semester, a budget to he rec-
ommenﬂed to the Associated

Women Students to cover that
semester. This budget shall be

ior approval no sooner than

budget has been made pubs
lie."

iTlle b "c reasons for this
change are that Slnce 1953,
budgets have been prepared and
pl‘csentcd for one semester at
a time, which docs not conform
to [he byelaw as It now stands;
the amount of the allotment for
the social budget varies with
the number of women in the
Quad each scmcstcr, thus lnalv
ing budgeting for the entire
year impractical; gonoral dis-
content with mass meetings to
approve the budget has been
voiced through studcnt petitions,
and women students in general
lack the information to form an
intelligent opinion on all pro-
visions of the social budget '

ilouse council members
would receive this information
previous to their voting, All
women students will have the
opportunity to read and ex-
amine a proposed budget, and
they will be able to express
any question or complaint
through their elected repre-
sentatives, the house council.
The meetings will be open to
any women interested in at-
tending. This revision would
abolish only those mass meet-
ing concerning the budget:

Women will also decide
whether or not they wish to ac—
cept an experimental program
extending women's closing hours
until 12 midnight every night.
Because it is planned that the
new library will be open for
