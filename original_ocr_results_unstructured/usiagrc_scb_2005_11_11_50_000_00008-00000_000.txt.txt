Second year solution

BY CAITLIN CARMODY

1n the Noyce elbow on Wednesday night, Robin
Cutler ‘08, feverishly working, finally threw his pen
down in frustration, In the Forum, BectaToop '08.
Michelle Pliain '08 and Lauro Franco '08 sat doing

- homework while listening to music and casually
chatting. in Burling Library, Lnurn Denver's ‘08 and
Marie Lindquist '08 were silently bent over interns
ship applications and class reading.

Aside from homework, new applications and
friendships, second-year students race a multitude
of changes and choices unique to their year.

To explore the sophomore experience, two ads
niinistrators have decided to conduct focus groirps
with current third»yenr students. Joyce stern ‘91,
associate dean and director of Academic Advising
and Ann GansemersTopf, research and assessment
analyst in the Institutional Research office hope to
gain insight into how students adapt in their sec-
and year.

They hope the information will be helpful in
structuring the sophomore retreat, part ofthc col-
lege's Expanding Knowledge initiative. Admin'
trators plan to use the retreat as a way of mm“,
ergizing students about the values of a liberal arts
education before they declare a major.

“Sophomore year is a period oftime that affects
everyone in similar ways, so I wondered if there
were ways to universally describe that experience,"
stern said. “Obviously every individual has their
own thing going on, but are there general themes
beyond the obvious?"

Higher education professionals across the coun-
try have often ignored students’ second year until
now.

“The first year experience has been well—rev
searched in terms ofwhat is happening. Fairly re-
cently, there's been a fair amount of attention on
the senior year, knowing that there’s another huge
transition," Stern said. “But there’s very little infor—
mation about the middle years and what’s going on
for students as they progress through college."

Until now, ssumptions about sophomore year
have been based on anecdotal evidence: conduct—
ing focus groups reﬂects a national trend in higher
education to find out more about college sophos
mores. ’

“I feel there’s this sort of overarching first se-
mester sophomore lull coming off the i tial high
of first year,"]effWeiner ’08 said. “The i rtial now
elty ofa free-ﬂowing liberal arts education hits you,

and you realize it’s not like that anymore, [There]
is a tension that is unavoidable and leads to so ho—
more year stress, partly due to academics [and]
partly due to a new wave ofresponsibility."

Typically consisting of five to eight people,
but sometimes as small as two, the focus groups
are conducted as informal discussions. Stern and
GansemersTopf ask opensended questions, letting
the students discuss their sophomore years among
themselves and feed off each other’s comments.
stern and Gansemer‘Topfsaid they were unsure of
what they would find.

“We can’tjnst take for granted that once we get
[students] to their sophomore year, everyone will
be great, and have an easy experience, and graduate
and go off and do wonderful things," Gansemers
Tepfsaid.

sarn Worzalla ’07, who participated in a focus
group, said challenges that sophomores face ins
clude planning a major declaration and four-year
plnn, study abroad applications and solidifying
friendships.

“I think it’s cool to acknowledge that it’s a chair
lengmg year,because 1 don't think I remember any
one ever mentioning anything like that,"she said.

. While the slew of decisions about the future
overwhelms some students, others find beneﬁts in
having a year ofcollege already under their belts.

”I've actually liked this year a lot more, because
1 don't feel plunged into a strange environment and
I'm more comfortable with myself academically
and in campus life," Liza Newman '08 said. “I feel
like last year I resisted the transition because I was
afraid of changing a lot and now I feel better ac,
climated and more comfortable."

Stern and Gansmer-Topf will finish the focus
groups with juniors next week and will conduct
focus groups with current sophomores early next
semester.

"I'd like to think that when we look at the poli-
cies that affect sophomores, the programs that are
targeted towards sophomores, and then this new
retreat," Stern said, “that we could at least be acting
on what we know is going on for our students."
