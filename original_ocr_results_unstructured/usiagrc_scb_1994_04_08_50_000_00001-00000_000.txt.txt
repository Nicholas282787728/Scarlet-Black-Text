SGA Presidential candidates share Views
and topics of concern in campaigns

ByAmanda Hombuckle

S that time again when the
traditional Grinnell apathy takes

a back seat and students get in
volved in campus politics. This year,
two students, current SGA Vice
President Monica Horton, and vote
eran Smith Hall Senator Aaron Fate
have thrown their hats into the ring
andarccompetingfortheSGAPresi-
dency.

Frustration with the lack of
SGA’s organization and Horton‘s
experience in leadership roles in
campus groups such as Affirmative
Action, Concerned Black Students,
and the multicultural collation is
what caused her to run for the SGA
Vice Presidential spotayear ago. “I
thought] could get things done and
follow tttrough on ideas,” I-Iorton
comments, “I think my successes as
Vice President show that] have done
that.” Because of the experience of
answering student’s questions and
working with various committees
and the administration throughout
her year in ofﬁce, Horton feels that

she is ready to accept the responsir
bilitics of the presidency.

Horton places a great deal of
importance on getting the students
involvcdincampusgovemmentand
events. She views studentinputas a
great means of getting things ac-
complished, Horton encourages
people to come to her with their
ideas which she is willing to follow
up and support. She feels thatdue to
lack ofstudent interest and involve-
ment, previous polls and interest
committees (such as the Smoking
Com mittee) have not provided a clear
pictureofthe true Studentaltitude on
cantpus, and therefore puts a greater
emphasis on the input of individual
students.

Campus security is one issue
that Horton believes would benefit
from increased student input. Cur—
rently, Horton supports one idea for
increased security which would in»
volvean additional manned security
force, much like the current Night
Watchmen However, she stresses
thatplansarein thebeginningstages
only, and more ideas are needed.
Another way in which Horton would

like to better involve Grinnell stu-
dents is to somehow train the hall
senators and provide them with a
calendar of events so that they can
be more interactive and effective,
and to better inform the Grinnell
community about SGA events.
Horton's final project is the im-
provement of town~gown relations.
Working through the Chamber of

Commerce, Horton feels that the
implementation of a card providing
Grinnell students with a small dis-
count at town stores would benefit
both communities and improve rela-
tions. In addition, she would like to
see the Grinnell students work with
community projects such as Grinnell

HIS spring three candidates

are vying for the position of

ViceAPresident of Grinnell
College’s Student Government Ase
sociation.

With a debate set for Sunday
evening and the elections to takeplace
on Monday, candidates Nancy Ying,
Jacob Wiltig, and Francis Menezes
put their campaigns into high gear
this week, posting their statemensof
intent and otherwise making them
selves known to the Grinnell student
body.

Menezes, a history major from
Iowa City, expressed his desire to
work for the establishment of more

smoke free dorms, more lighting on
campus, and the placementof labs on
transcripts, among other things He
also said that he‘d like to establish a
working relationship with students
so that they will feel comfortable
approaching him with concerns they
have about SGAt

Although Menezes has experi-
enceas a member of the student hous-
ing committee and as a Senator with
SGA, he stressed that his involve-
ment with SGA hasbeen recenL This
status as a newcomer is his most
important asset as a Vice-Presiden-
tial candidate, he says, because it
means that he’s not tied to campus
politics as othercandidates have been
in the past, so he would be free to
