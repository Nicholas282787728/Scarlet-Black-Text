Letters from the Old World
Part III — Scotland

By Riva Sharples, Foreign Correspondent

 

 

University as soon as classes started onJanuary 10, and then almostimmediately foundmyself itching

to get out of Lancaster and travel. Luckily. the British transponation system is fabulous. and, unlike
the USA, there are trains and buses that gojust about anywhere, so fulﬁlling my desire to travel is easy and
virtually painless.

My first big trek out of Lancaster (aside from the little trips I took around the immediate area) was to
Edinburgh, Scotland's capital. with three other Americans. It was one of those spur-oi»the»momem trips
(often the bestkind). It was a Friday. Jason (a guy from Georgia) and I had planned to go to the Lake District
with a group of Lancaster students, but, much to our frustration and disappointment, tickets were sold out
when we got to the desk. In desperation at the thought of being left in Lancaster for an entire weekend (things
get pretty dead here on weekends as British students tend to go home), we went to the campus British Rail
office and looked til the uain timetable. We said, "Let‘s get on the next train going to a major city." It was
the 1650 headed for Edinburgh. We bought our tickets, scurried around packing our daypacks, and ran into
our friends Keoni and Marta (both from Whitman College in Washington state) along the way. persuading
them to accompany us.

After a breathless run from the bus station to the train station, the four of us arrived hufﬁn g and pufﬁng
just in time to see what we thought was our train pulling out of the station. Fortunately, our train had been
delayed one hour (a much too common occurrence here) and so we made it. It was an express. and we stepped
out of the train in Edinburgh two and a half hours later at 8:00 pm. We didn't know what to do or where to
go, so we hailed a taxi and were taken to the nearest youth hostel.

Dumping our packs and storing our valuables with the desk attendant. we headed out onto the streets of
Edinburgh in search of food and entertainment. We wandered onto what we later learned was the main drag
in Edinburgh: Princes Street. The street was alive with people, particularly couples. walking everywhere.
We joined the crowd, hoping to find a good Scottish restaurant. But all we could ﬁnd were McDonalds and
Burger King, and none of us wanted to eat American fﬁl food. at least not on the first day.

We turned off Princes Street and ﬁnally found a classy yet inexpensive Spanish restauranton a small side
street Because itwas Friday night. there was live entertainmentby singers and dancers. Dressed in colorful
dresses. the dancers would dance for customers or with customers, hoping for a tip. We stayed at the
restaurant for four hours. Some very nice Irishman bought us a bottle of wine (mainly because we were
American), and I ason received Spanish dancing lessons from one of the dancers.

On Saturday, we decided to change hostels to a cheaper one on the other side of town, so we ended up
carrying our packs around all day. Mine, unfortunately, was the heaviest pack among us. as I had had the
bright idea of bringing my 2,500 page Norton Anthology along, in case Idecided to do any reading (brilliant
idea, Riva,just brilliant).

We breezed in and out of several Scotch Whisky centers, took photos at John Knox's house, and then
climbed 287 steps to the top of the Scott Monument. Located in the center of the city, the monument is an
elaborate 200-foot spiral that offers a very good view of the city, if one is brave enough to climb to the top.
When they wanted us that people with vertigo should not go to the top. they were not kidding! The higher
we climbed, the smaller the space became, and we didn't think that we were going to make it with our giant
packs strapped to our backs.

But we did make it. and just when we thought we had survived, we discovered that coming down steep
spiral stairs is much harder than going up, Once we finallydid getto theboltom. we spent theevening relaxing
on l-lzlymtlrketSLreet, II streetfull ofinteresting pubs. Mostfeatured live music ranging from Scottish bagpipe
music to American techno.

Coming back to Lancaster University was certainly a let-down after such a trip. But. in order to cheer
our spirits, Jason rind I started planning another adventure. this time to London, Our adventures in that city
will be the subject of next week's letter. Until then, cheers!

LIKE most students abroad, I quickly settled into the humdrum routine of daily life at Lancaster
