Serious (lanccrs at Grinncll face a sparse number of curricular
offerings, but this has done norhing to hinder rhc crcerivc imagine
tions ofthe four chorcogrdphcr's ofDence Tronpc's production Fir/l
Forward. Thc studcnt choreographers showcased rhcir crcatlvc and
idiosyncratic dances lesrThnrsdey through sundey in Bucksbenm’s
Flanagan Theater.

Flt/l For wall], which was mct with enthusiastic audiences all four
performance days, was tllc culmination ofDenccTroupc's work this
semester, The performance, directed by Shawn VVomack,Thcatrc
and Dance, showcased the efforts ofTroupe dancers and of student
choreographers Henna Hakim '08, Denny Zamora ’08, Shannon
Edwards ’07 and Noga Ashckenzi Y09.

The pcrformancc came at a time of change in Grinncll’s danc:
progrem, At the end of last semesrer, the Theerre deperrmenr
changed its name to the Department ofTheatrc and Danco Stun
dents are now able to emphasize any of several areas, including
dancc,within the majol. “Now the courses you take in dance are no
longer electives like they have been until last year, and they can actut
ally connr ro your rheerer inejor,”seid Ashkcnazi. “I chose rhe denee
track of the major, which means i am taking most ofthe courses in
dance." Even after the changc, thc curricular offerings in dance are
quite limitedWomack, the only full’ﬂmc dance professor, tcachcs
all the courses in dance theory and practice. Lccturcr Kathleen Huts
ley,Theerre end Denee, teeehes ballet elesses.

Dance Troupc prescnts the opportunity for students to put class
room theory into ptacticc.“Basicale, everybody who’s into rhe denee
depertment evcnruelly becomes pert orTronpc," seid Zamora. “So
it’s kind ofllkc we get all the academic knowledgc,or all the knowlr
edge, all ot’the theory in the classroom but we dance as being part
orDanceTroupe. And I think ther's how we beer with not having e
huge deperrmcnt or nor having enough classes.”

“Dance Troupe is a grcer opporruniry ro do dance on a regular
besis, lirerelly every day," Ashkcnazi said “Its good rrennng for rhe
body end it enables you to work in rhe fall wirh student choreoge
raphcrs and in the spring with professional choreographers, guest
choreographers, who come from outside [Grinncll].”

Alrhough rhis year’s Dance Troupe is smaller than usual, both
Ashekenazi and Zamora attributcd thc small sizc to a more sclcctive
auditioning process rather than a shortage of interest in the pro—
gram. The choreographers, who errended auditions and took pen
in selecting Troupe members early this semester, had to he ﬂew
iblc [0 work around thc small number of dancers. “When we have
our first mccting, wc coma in with ideas. W: say, ‘I would like this
many people and 1 would like rhese cerrein.dencers'... end we see
who we're interested in to perform in our piece, depending on their
movcmcnt,” Zamora said.

The end rcsult is the dynamic creation of four modern dilnCT
cs that deconstruct various stereotypes associated wtth dance and
challenge thc staid formalities sometimes associated with classical
dance.The dances explore sryles like dence rheerre, which blurs thc
bounrlalics bcrwccn dance and dramar “Hanna's dance (“Burst into
Collapsc”) is very movcmcnhotlentcd. It has no text. it’s just bodics
dancing to music," seid Ashkcnazi. “Danny's piece (“ltCttrus”) has

Edwards, who spenr rhe semester offecernpus in Chicago, choe

pcrform her solo dancc, cntitlcd “Classic” and set to music sh: sen

Dancers end choreographers elilce find innoverive ways to create
art in Grinncll’s limited and intimate setting. For Zamora.Grinncll's
small dance program is not necessarily a drawback, “Those of us
who came to Grinnell and discovered dance as an academic option

..reelly find Joy in the feet ther rheres so few ofus and that were
so tight, said Zamora. We often talk in classes...tl1at we lack the
time to train, but we ’rc making up for it in really knowing what the
background ofdenee is. Where it's coming from, why we're doing,
what we’re doing and really putting the effort into understanding
the art form, I think that’s the beauty ofir, and that's th: beauty of
being in Grinnell.“
