Class of 2011: Student athletes, not from Midwest

BY JEFF RADERSTRDNG AND CAIT SCHERR
The college recently began a new market—
ing campaign to attract more applicants and
prospective students. The new recruiting link
terial, paiticularly the "No Limits” slogan, has
caught the ittcntion of many on campus.

Jim Stunner, Dean ofAdiiiis on d Fir

cttches peoples irrentron When vou get 100

thinking, 'I7Iow can I .it—
range rtn life so 1 will end
up in Iowa?"

“we're a gicit school,
but we’re in the middle of
the cotnliclds," Stunner
said. “Publications must
catch people's attention."

Despite the apparent
success of the new earn»
paign, sortie professors and
students feel that the slogan, along with the
recent tuition increases, could shift Giinnell's
applicant demographics.

does have some significant
diffeiences from classes of
previous yea . According to
Sumner, the ugh amount of
graduating athletes meant
that coaches had a large an
pact on recruitment and that
athletic applicants are up.
Sunlncr also said there was an increase in the
number ofinternational students accepted this
spring.
According to Sumner, there is a heavy rep
resentation of prospective students from the

“Though I have a smaller pool or pcople,"]ur
genlieiiner said, “i can see they are really high
lighting athletics, and all of [the students] I
hosted have been from the East Coast."

Sumner said that this year's hosting ofpror
spective students has been successful and he is
conﬁdent that the success will continue into
the future. “I'm optimistic at this point and,
like everyone else, can’t wait to see how it turns
out in the next couple ofweeks.”

do so. "

Assistant Dean
and Director of Resi—
dence Life Sheree Andrews credited Hall with
pursuing the issue.

“I know students are upset With the way
the drug situations are handled on campus
butI don’t think that much emphasis was put
on it until Chris put more muscle behind it,“
said Andrews. A similar initiative was brought
up two years ago, but no serious headway was
made until this semester.

students in substanctrfrez: housing have
mixed opinions about the possible implemens
ration of this policy. Patrick Thomas ’10, who
lives in Kcrshaw Hall, is pleased with the cone
cept. “I like this way of dealing with it better
because it doesn’t involve the police," he said.
"And I think the college should handle issues
with students on campus, not the police.”

Fdlow Hannibal-Kershaw resident Chris-
tina Wagner '09 has a different opinion.

“It doesn't really affect me, but one thing
I've never understood is why Grinnell college
is different from any other part of the world,"
she said. “It seems like this policy makes an ex-
ception to laws that are in place for a reason."

Administrators, however, are going to great
lengths to make sure the new policy is in ac-
cordance with the law.

"The next part of the process is for the
policy revision to go to Tom Cindy and the
group has suggested thathe talk to the police
so they’re not blind sided With the changes,"
said Andrews. “It needs to go to the college
legal council as well.”

Neithchoin Crady, Vice President of sl’ll’
dent Affairs, nor Steve Briscoe, Director ofSer
entity, were willing to comment on the issue.

The college legal council will be in charge
of reviewing the changes to the pol icy and
confiiming that they are compatible with state
and federal law. Some ofthese laws include the
Drug Free Schools and Campuses Act of1989
(DFSCA), the Jeanne Cleiy Act of 2000 and
the Hig hcr Education Act of1965

If the policy docs not comply with these
acts, “it could put ﬁnancial aid injcopardy and
do a lot of damage to the college," said An-
drcws.

Hall remains optimistic that the negative
impact on the college can be prevented as long
as the right people are aware of the changes.
“Potentially, we have to discuss this policy
change with the Grinnell Police Department
and see what they think," said I-Iall. “It‘d be our
goal, though, that it won't affect the collegCr
police relationship in any adverse way.”

SGA
from p. I

known as the “slush fund."
Many in SGA believe this
will increase the students’
voice on campus and send clear messages to
admistrators and trustees regarding student
priorities.

“The STIFund is an original idea that will
have a great impact on the ﬁlturc of SGA,"
Loosehead Senator Suzanne Polivy '08 said,

Despite the recent productivity of SGA, at
least some ofthcir work this semester has been
overshadowed by the controversy reprding
conflicts of interest in the Vice President for
Academic Affairs election that took place in
March. The conflicts arose when SGA senar
tors and cabinet members made decisions af-
fecting the election after having endorsed one
of the candidates.

This Wednesday, Joint Board approved by-
law reform that prohibits any senator or Cabir
net member from providing written endorse—
ment of any candidate. With the ﬁnalizing of
constitutional and bylaw reform this week, For
livy said, “the problems for now have been re
solved, and the bylaw reform will clarify things
in the futurc,"Polivy added that while constir
tutlonril reform had been a priority of SGA
this year, “the crisis provoked an increased cf-
fort to get those reforms ratified."

Constitutional reform, however, will prob
:1ny not be how most students remember the

current SGA, In addition to the STIFund,
Hall and Bishop said that the creation of the
campus pub will be part or the legacy of tlic
2006 2007 SGA as well as the continuing
effort to create an in house drug policy in
which marijuana possession would be handled
without contacting Grinnell Police.

Pelivy said she believes this year followed a
trend of-i friendlier, more approachable SGA
“but it's a constant challenge to turn these
small changes into larger changes."

Besides this continual challenge to be seen
as effective, Hall said that next year's SGA
would need to address several developments to
campus life. “We are (ht: ﬁrst SGA to use the
new campus center," Hall said, “and we have
dealt with many of these issues crcatively."Hall
and Bishop said the need to reinvigorate cen-
tral campus, find a use for the old post office
and (Lind, and move forward with the future
of financial aid are among several problems
that SGA will need to address.

Ultimately, Hall hopes that future SGA
members will look to this year and recognize
that the one key to their success was formr
ing relationships VVltl‘i each other. We all got
along phenomenally," Hall said “Work has
been" done in a really pleasant way. .We start
ed as acquaintances, and are leaving as good
friends who have also been able to work well
together.”

 

SGA 2006-2007

- Student Initiatives: The creation
of the STIFund and the STIFund commits
tee has enabled SGA to move forward with
implementing initiatives that have been
passed in the last ten years The commit-
tee is currently moving forward with plans
to obtain bean bag chairs, an in-house Elle
sharing system, additional picnic tables, a
radio tuner for theJRC, and an onrctimpus
swing set.

' Policy Changes: In addition to
the new drug policy that may be impler
merited, SGA also worked to increase the
student pay frequency, advocated for the
creation of a loanrforgivencss program,
and worked to have nutrition information
readily available in the dining hall.

- Reform: Many of the changes to
the constitution have been logistical, but
will likely help SGA run more smoothly in
future SGA has also worked closely with
students to strengthen interest in SGA and
increase the productivity of the cabinet
and Joint Board.

- Campus Pub: If the pub is suCr
ccssﬁil, it may be the most visible and
physical legacy of this year's SGA for a
long time to come.
