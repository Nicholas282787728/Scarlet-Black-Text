“Mary the Third” Is One of Most}
Succesful of Crothers'
Produced Plays.

The commencement plil' “Mary the
Third," is a modern American comedy
by Rachel (Tl-others. It. is one of the
author's most successful plays yet
produced.

The comedy concerns the lives of
three Marys. the grandmother, the
mother and the (laughter, but the main
action DI the play centers around Mary
the Third. In the prologue two b of
flash-backs are given of the engage-
ments of both Mary the First and
Mary the Second which are practical-
ly the some in their earnest assertoins
that theirs will he “the must. woudeiu
fui love in the world."

Mary the Third, a typical modem
girl of toda’y, feels that the marriages
of her mother and grandmother have
been failures and that her marriage
will be “different.” She is interested
in two men, but cannot decide whom
she will marry. Her attempts to de-
cide this and to make sure that her
lovc ill be the "most wonderful man
in the‘world" lend to a series of situ-
ations both amazing and serious.

The play has been in rehearsal for
two weeks under the direction of Mrs.
Ottllie Seybolt. The cast includes the

Mary the Thirdilllercedes Jelsma.

Curtis Lamb Tells
Of His Experiences
Teaching In Greece

Dr, G. Herbert Knight received a
letter from Curtis Lamb, who gradu-
ated from Grinnell in 1927 and is now
engaged in teaching in the American
college at Cbariloas, Snlonica, Greece.
While a student at Gl'innell, Mr, Lamb
was campus editor of the SCARLET
AND BLACK, a member of Grinnell
Forensic, a member of sigma Delta
Chi, a member of the Cyclcnc staff and
a writer on the Grinnell News bureau.

The letter written to Dr. Knight tolr
lows:

Dear Dr. Knight: This year's do-
veloplnents in.Forcnsic work have in-
tel'ested me a great deal, and it seems
to me that the proposition of an ex-
change oi speakers at the regular
chapel periods is not only sound in
principle but likely to prove popular
in college circles everywhere. it
doesn't hurt to bring our debating
down out of the abstract clouds; up
though at the some time I see great
value In preparation at talks on inter-
national aliairs and philosophical
problems even if it takes wit and a
liberal supply of anecdotes to get them
across to listeners.

l’liuls African Tour.

Summer vacations are an intriguing

spect oi the work here. I plan to
join Alden Greene ,unotber young
American, and an Englishman named
P‘opplestone in a tour oi Africa this
ummer. 1 have made a sleeping
ag, bought a dulfcl bag, and a bean-
iful sun helmct, and am rapidly getv
ing other things necessary together.

don't reel inclined to expand this little
escapndc into an epic adventure, but
believe me, we sure had um. I just
made up a bed left from last Monday
morning with new inspiration born of
sleeping- on boards last night. Any-
thing with springs under it is 21 mar»
vclous invention.

0n arriving there at the monastery,
wo were struck with joy to see a
couple strutting peacocks bciorc the
high walls. But say, did you ever
hear the gorgeous bird's cri It’s a
sound like that or a child in home
distress, like a raging ticrcss with a
thorn in her Toot; it’s an oar-splitting
mixture or a county lair whistle and
velous invention.

Visits Olympus.

The next morning with a boy as our
guide, we did not need to wander so
aimlessly over the bills as wc beaded
tor the station. Sure enough, Mai-y
Bigeiow, (Maui-ices wife and a Grins
nell grad or about s years) was on
the train, and we werc quitc boisterous
on seeing her, I'm afraid. Anyhow,
the train puffed on around the great
curve or ‘the bay until we passed
Kilteri‘nzl and came to the little station
right under Mount Olympus called
Litochoro, which is very hard to spell
without using Greek characters. Ac-
cent is on the ﬁrst ”,”0 while ’the i
is pronounced in the usual European
fashion as ”ea."

I felt that the Olympus sconcry wc
viewed in the great gap Where the pier
turc was always airplaneclike, .was the
best rd ever witnessed includiug the
Swiss Alps and everything else. Who
could wish for a more extensive pano-
rama than the great Mediterranean
that stretched away several score miles
to Mount Athns; and what more glori-
ous detail of majesty could be desired
than the home of the gods, with the
iootstool oi nourishing vegetation be
low us, and the snow covered throne
of Jupiter towering above!

Returns Home.

We rose at ﬁve, and could not pay
our respects to the monks who were
at prayers, so we began our walk
under the fragrant pines down the side
of the mountain. Going down. or
course, donkeyvhack, is not the com—
fortable sensation of ascending, since
a part at the way becomes as sleep as
a broad stairway.

Nothing exciting occurred to break
the monotony at our third class rail
trip home. It was stuffy with smoke,
but we fought ﬁre with are; nine huge
round loaves or bread lined the bag»
gage carrlers overhead, lobsters wal-
lowed in paint spilled on the iloor or
our compartment. On arriving, we
were glad to adjourn to the Bigelow's
for immense bowls of broad and milk.
Last night’s Dine and a half hours 0!
sleep did not come amiss, and l loci
quite chipper today with tennis halt an
hour in the offing.

Very trule
CURTIS LAMB.

“Particularly 1 Wish to remark upon
the attitude of your students who, in
the triendliness of their greetings up-
on street and campus and the collrtec
ous manner in which they directed the
Visitors about the institution, reflect—
ed the fine spirit which evidentl'y Dre»
Veils among the young people who
make up your splendid college.

“The well planned arrangements for
the comfort and convenience or the
