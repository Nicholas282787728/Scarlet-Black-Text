Dear Editor,

Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I
missed the point, but something
about the Take Back the Night
March disturbs me.

It’s not that I think that gender-
based violence is not a serious prob-
lem. When in the United States from
1.8 to 4.0 million women are as-
saulted by their husbands or boy-
friends annually, there deﬁnitely is
a problem.

Nor is it that I think that this
problem should not be addressed.
My participation with Domestic
Violence Alternatives/Sexual As-
sault Center, Fearless, and the Day
of Silence shows that I do believe
gender-based violence should be ad-
dressed, and that I believe I have a
duty to address it,

It also is not that I believe that
women should not confront the is»
sues of sexual assault and domestic
violence. When one in three girls is
the victim of sexual abuse or incest
and one in four college women is
raped on a date, gender-based vio-
lence clearly is a women’s problem,
and I believe that women should ac-
tively address this problem.

What I do not believe is that
women should address it alone.

When 95% of all spousal as»
saults are committed by men, sexual
assault and domestic violence are
men’s problems, too. And to end
them will require the initiative and
cooperation of men.

Both sexes are affected by gen-
der-based violence. and everyone‘s
active participation is required to end
this ill. We cannot afford to let any—
body be sidelined.

Yet, Thursday, at the Take Back
the Night march, that is how I felt—
sidelined. I felt that I was not al-
lowed to stand in solidarity with
women4that I was not allowed to
be pan of the solution.

Granted, there was the men‘s
discussion group. I was allowed to
sit in a room and talk while the work
was being done outside. Maybe it’s
just my own selﬁshness. but I wanted
to do more,

I know this sense of exclusion
is not what the Politically Active
Feminist Alliance intended when
they organized the Take Back 'the
Night marchibut iris how I feel.
And, unfortunately, I am not alone.
The struggle to end gender-based
violence is an uphill battle. If we
want any hope of success, we can-
not afford to marginalize our allies
but rather we must acknowledge
everyone’s part in finding a solution.

In the end, this whole verbose
diatribe comes down to this: I want
to help, but the structure of the Take
Back the Night march made me feel
that I was not allowed to. Please, let
me and other concerned men help.

Thank you for your patience.

RS. There are others with similar re-
actions, but some of themdid not feel
comfortable speaking out lest they
be branded unsympathetic to the is-
sue. Similarly, there are some who
were offended by Michael Sa Jin
Kwok’s letter but did not speak out
lest they be branded racist. I believe
a school that can instill such fear in
people but claims that ‘the only thing
not tolerated is intolerance’ has some
serious soul searching to do. But
that‘s another issue.

SAC training manual.

Dear Editor.

This letter is in response to last
issue’s letter to the editor which en-
tertained the possibility of bringing
the band, They Might Be Giants, to
Grinnell. In last issue’s letter, the
supporters of this band claimed that
the cost of bringing such a show to
Grinnell was probably about the

- same as either of last year’s bands,
Soul Coughing or Coke. This is far
off the mark. In reality, They Mighl
Be Giants normally charge over
double what we paid for Soul
Coughing last year , and close to
triple what We paid for Cake. Add-
ing production costs, the budget pro-
jection of a They Might Be Giants
show would be over half of the con-
certs committee‘s spring budget.
The net result is that if we brought
this band to Grinnell, the rest of the
Spring concert schedule would cons
sis! of small name bands that no one

to the editor

will have heard of and no one will
come.
The fact that most of Thify Might Be
. Gianlr‘ songs are a bit strange isn’t
necessarily that bad. Grinnell is a
place where diversity is important (or
at least said to be important), and
concens are one place where a com-
mitment to diversity is mirrored. This
is evidentfrom the many types of mu-
sic brought here. The plan is that
hopefully between rock,jazz, blues.
reggae, folk, and the many other
kinds of music we get to experience,
that hopefully there will be a little
something for everyone.
The problem with TMBG comes not
from their eccentricity alone, but
from their eccentricity compounded
with their price tag. Previously, Grinr
hall has made the most of their bud-
get by either bringing younger, de-
veloping bands that cost less while
still maintaining high performance
standards, or by bringing bands that
are passing through the area and need
to book shows (so that they are will-
ing to lower their price). Unless we
can get a considerable break on
standardly charged rates, the viabil-
ity of bringing They Might Be Giants
to Grinnell is extremely low, For
example, a younger band such as
Morphine would Cost about half as
much money, while still appealing to
a wide audience at Grinnell. Still, I
am interested to hear opinions. Are
students willing to sacriﬁce the rest
of Spring semester‘s concerts for
bringing TMBG to Grinnell?!?t,..,

Dear Editor'

I am writing this letter from abroad.
and so I apologize for any misunder-
standings I may have of the develop»
ment of these issues, as a result of
my absence—and for this relatively
late reply to the Oct. 3 and 10 issues
of the 54211, which I have just re-
ceived.

I was interested to read the articles
and letters on multiculturalism and
space in those two issues. I have to
say that it was painful and enraging
to read the Opinion Editor’s response
to Michael Sa Jin Kwok’s letter. The
response began with an apology to
Michael and the campus, and then
turned toward a personal assault on
Michael. While Michael was care-
ful not to allude to the writer of the
article in connection with his com-
plaint. even explicitly stating: “I am
not trying to single out the writer and
cartoonist,” the Opinion Editor states
that “We do not appreciate your slan-
der against our staff writer..."
Michael's complaint was against the
5&8 and the Grinnell College com-
munity, not against the writer of the
article, and that seems clear. Neither
should it disqualify his complaint that
Michael declined to comment for the
initial article: the issue is still the way
in which Grinnell and the S&B treat
the issues of space and
multiculturalism.

The Opinion Editor states that “it is
your job, if you care enough, to make
your perspective known... So, Mr. Sa
Jin Kwok, if you want the S&B...to
represent you and other students of
color, please contribute." First.
Michael has contributed. There is a
page and a half on page four as mini»
mal proof. Second, that tone is hardly
a chummy invitation tojoin the 5&1?
staff—it is a challenge and a threat.
It creates a hostile atmosphere, one
in which I would not be wanting to
work. Third, the invitation itself is
based on a notion which, although in
practice true (nothing is accom-
plished without action), is distress
ingly simple. “It is yourjob,” “ifyou
care enough.” “ifyou want..." These
phrases are trying to place a burden,
nolj'ust of action, but of guilt. Yet it
is not as easy for someone who has
no social voice—no forum for rep-
resentation in the press of the “aver-
age" person—to suddenly stand up
and speak, much less to join forces
with that press. Some people do it.
They may ﬁnd it empowering, de-
spite the obstacles they still face, to
make that other forum somewhat
their own. But many people will be
wary of allying themselves with a
structure which, however much it
professes sympathy, is still built and
maintained by the opposition, so to
speak. Hopefully most of us can re-

late to this analogy: imagine if the
KKK asked us to speak or write on
Grinnell’s conservative multicultural
policies at their next march on the
mall of DC The sense of desire to
be heard. yet disbeliefin the sincer-
ity of the offer, and simultaneous ter-
ror at what might happen to us, may
be similar. It just wouldn’t be so
easy. Imagine that potentially dan-
gerous force multiplied by millions:
and meanwhile they’re telling you
that your silence, that is, youroppres-
sion, is your own fault. Why doesn’t
the 5&8 ask itself how it might
change this situation? Why should
the burden be on the same people,
again and again—the burden ofsur-
viving oppression, and overturning
it—when we claim we recognize the
problem?

Michael’s letter seemed to me to
address this issue: the failure on
Grinnell College‘s part (trustees, fac-
tilty, administration, and students
alike) to put fonh the multicultural
cause as a shared cause, interest, and
battle. It is not the duty of a few
people to change our community. At
Grinnell, if the statistics are right—
80+% in suppon of space—it is ri»
diculous, even shameful that we
should think this way. What is this a
symptom of, and how else does it
affect us?

I am thinking of the issue which
seems to stand out most regarding the
space issue. The 5&3, Michael’s
letter points out, has fairly consis»
tently presented the View that
progress is being made. In the Oct.
3 article, the 5&3 shows sympathies
on behalf of space—I am looking at
the student quotes on the front page,
and the mention of the immense
amount of space occupied 9 to 5 by
the Director of Admissions—and
even spent the last ﬁve paragraphs
addressing some of the obstacles yet
to be overcome before we can hope
to see actual space. Still the title of
the articleieven with the 5&B's
apologies taken into consideration—e
reads symbolically and actually of
Grinnell’s desire to consider the
problems of space, and all it brings
with it, resolved.

It may have been Freudian. Or, if
you don’t believe in the psyche re-
vealing itself, it may have been an
oversight. But oversights are telling:
they tell us what we are not looking
out for, what we have not been sen-
sitized to and trained to see. The title
of that article is a symptom of an il-
lusion we perpetuate—either as a
tool of survival or a tool of oppres-
sion, maybe both—that things aren’t
so bad, or that, at least, things are
getting better. We need to be opti-
mistic, to have a sense of progress
and success, in order to continue.
But if all we tell ourselves is that
things are good, we tend to forget the
problems that remain. Then we be-
gin to discredit those who say there
is still a problem. And now our tool
of coping has turned against us and
exacerbates the problem it was de—
signed to aid: we are creating an at—
mosphere of doubt and denial, of
hostility towards those who see that
things just aren't getting better. Sup-
port turns back in upon itself and
becomes oppression.

Most of us suspect that the trustee‘s
subcommittee on space isjust a ges-
ture, or is doomed to failure. There
have been other such administrative
betrayals, as Michael points out. I
would number among them, in the
hope ofmaking this more accessible,
the administration’s dealing with the
publicized sexual assault last semes-
ter. So why aren’t we, all 80+% of
us, planning a withdrawal before the
ﬁrst day of classes next semester—
before Grinnell can withhold.our
money, and before they can recruit

enough other students to take our ‘

economic places? Why not force the
issue? It is everyone’s issue. Where
do our sympathies really lie? Are
they just our sympathies, or are they
our souls?

Editor’s note: ,

The 5&8 would again like lo make
an apology for a mistake in Ihz pub-
lication of Michael St: Jin Kwok‘r
letter This slalenlenl was left out of
Mr: 50 Jin K wok ’s lzller accidentally:
“First ofall the title of lhe article
was BLATANTLY misleading. The
Board of Trustee: have nine no xor l
of commitment lo space for student:
of color They have formed a sub»
committee Ihal has taken N0 CON-
CRETE ACTION. lfDavid Nathan
would have attended the meeting
with the Board of Trustees he could
have seen first-hand the lock of

CONCRETEACTIONorl the par! of
the Trustees." We have already made
a personal apology to Mr, So Jin
Kwak about this omission. l hadrl ’I
realized when I wrote my last re-
sponse pointing lo the slander ofo
Nathan ihol lhir quote had been left
on! accidentally.

I though! about leaving in this note
only what is conlailled in the above
statement, but I fell compelled be-
cuure I don ’l worn a misunderstand-
ing of my previous response, to write
another response. What is contained
in this note, howevel; is lhc expressed
opinion of the Opinion Editor: Tequio
Burl.

I never meant for the response I
wrote in the previous issue to have a
negative connalaiion to it. I .tincerly
mean! that I agreed with the issue:
that Mr, Sa Jin Kwok wrote abaul in
his letter One of the main reason: I
joined the stuff of the sets war .to
that I would have a forum in which
my voice would be heard. I chol-
lenged, and yes it was a challenge
Michael 50 Jill Kwak Io writefarthe
paper becaure I honestly think that
[I would help create a paper that i:
more representative afall the voices
on campus. I most certainly, being
a black woman, did not mean to my
that it was his responsibility to “edu-
Cale " others on irruer of .
multiculturalism. In fact, I ﬁnd that
slightly ofenrive. l have made the
argument, in previous columns that
l have written, that Ifezl ii i: lhe re-
rpansibility ofwllite people is learn
things on their own so that they will
have more ofu complete understand-
ing of issues of race. It is not lhejbb
of people of color to “educate ” olh-
er: about themselves. I oﬂered the
challenge to Mr Sa Jin Kwak hop-
ing that he would take it a: a rincm
effort by another perron of color he
knows (and hopefully trusts) to have
another avenue in which he could
express his opinion. Yes, my re-
sponse was ruiherperronol and] did
have doubts about printing it. but I
rhaughl ii was important It i: very
seldom that 11 person of color is of-
fered the chance to have their per»
rpeclive expressed in popular media.
I oﬂered Michael Sn Jin Kwok this
opportunity becaur I believe tho! he
has the right to make his perspective
known and make it known that his
opinion is signiﬁcant in these issues.
I feel that people ofcolur are silenced
in popular media and I, being
underrepresented in popular media
in lhc larger society a: well or on
this campus, thought that Ihir war a
wondecﬁil opportunity to lnvile on-
other person, also historically
underrepresented, to unrilence hint-
self and make his perspective known
in media that generally ignore: him.

So, Mr. Moore, I want Io thank you
also for your contribution to the
opinion page of the 8&8. I am truly
delighted that there is a dialouge
about race and racism in there past
few issues of the 5&8. Thai is the
job of a newspaper, is it not: to cre»
ate a forum for discourse on issue:
such or these. I hope that people like
Mr. Moore onde Salln Kwok can-
linue lo oﬁ‘er a more ill-depth critique
on the articles featured in the 5&8.

To the Grinnell College Community,

We, the members of the 1997
women‘s varsity soccer team, are ex-
tremely upset and disappointed by
the placement of a huge tent on our

‘ soccer field for the October 4_th

men’s football game. This te'nt
shows blatant disregard not only for
our playing ﬁeld but for our team.

Over the last few years our ﬁeld
conditions have improved signifl~
cantly, but this kind of treatment is
inappropriate, Huge metal stakes
held up a tent directly on the North-
east corner of the ﬁeld prompting
people to migrate there and ﬂatten
out the grass. Not only that but after
inspecting the ﬁeld the Monday fol-
lowing the game, there were huge
holes signifying a lack of effort in
replacing the torn out sod. After
looking even closer, tire tracks were
visible and one large metal stake
about three inches in diameter re
mained sticking upon the ﬁeld for
any of us to seriously injure ourselves
on.

There are plenty of other places that
the tent could have gone. We find it
hard to believe that an alternate site
could not be found.

We don‘t intend to pointﬁngers at
the football players themselves. We

’ OPINION

are simply questioning the decisions
of the athletic depanment’s (and all
other parties) choice to use our prac-
tice and game ﬁeld as the tent site.
While we acknowledge the damage
is slight and may seem insignificant,
We value our team and our field and
we would hope that the rest of the

community treats us and il wnh re-

spect.

Dear Editor,

I read with great interest Jeremy
Tolbert’s review of the documentary
Times of Harvey Milk in the most
recent issue of the Scarlet and Black.
I was, however, quite surprised that
Mr. Tolbert did not mention the late
Richard Schmiechen, a Grinnell Coir
lege graduate from the class of ‘69,
who produced the ﬁlm and actually
received the Oscar at the award cer-
emony. Rich was a great friend and
communicator to whom many stur
dents from that time owe a tremenr
dous debt of gratitude for his
thoughtful and forgiving perspective
as a not-so-openly gay person living
on an oh-so-openly homophobic
campus. There is no question that
the quiet, compassionate tone of the
ﬁlm derives as much from What Rich
was able to bring to the subject as it
does from the subject itself. Rich is
sorely missed for his intelligence,
wit, ability to teach, AND willingr
néss to forgive by those of us who
continue to struggle with many of
these same issues yet today.
Sincerely,

,Jeffery L. Phelps ‘71

Dear Editor,

In the October 10 edition of the
SELB, Grinnell student Michael Sa
Jin Kwon-lacobs made a several ac—
cusations about both myself and the
Scarlet and Black. While I hold
Michael in the highest respect as
ASIA’s spokesperson and a diligent
and committed proponent in
Grinnell’s struggle for space, I feel a
few a few issues should be clariﬁed.

Early on in our reporting process,
Ryan Olson and I contacted ASIA to
request interviews with both its lead-
ership and its members. ASIA re—
sponded by sending us back a letter
informing us thatASIA had no com~
ment.

After composing the article, it was
submitted to several of my sources
to insure its validity. The article that
ran was approved as accurate by ad-
ministrators, students, upperclass»
men, leaders of organizations and
organization members. Mr. Kwon-
Jacobs’s claim that the article
is”blatantly misleading" is simply
untrue.

Mr. Kwon-Jacobs neither got ln
touch with me while the article was
being written nor after it was pub»
lished. Since last week, he has also
turned down my invitations to meet
over a meal and discuss matters.

Again, I must to reiterate that I hold
Mr. Kwonrlacobs's work in the hi gh-
est regard; speaking from personal
experience, I was struck early on
during my research by how often his
name came up as I conducted my me
terviews. But I digress; that‘s the
subject of another article. My point
is that there was some inaccurate In-
formation in last week’s S&B and I
believe, as I’m sure Mr. Kwon-
Iacobs also believes, that misleading
press should be corrected. Thank
you.

Technicolor Penguins

BY ERIN PETERSEN
Columnist

It happens every year. Every year,
the seniors, without fail, proclaim
that this llcwcsl group of freshmen
is an unﬁt class. There is no way they
can possibly continue and further
Grinltcll’s tradition ofcxcellence and
weirdness. as evidenced by the fact
that these new people have annoy-
ing habils such as personal hygiene.
I, too, was skeptical after aireshman
showed obvious disdain when I
failed to tuck in my Shlrl, To her I
say, “Scoff not, ob young child who
has so little work that you can pay
attention to such minor details. Your
time will Come."

I admit, I was a bit concerned about
the J Crew factor when I ﬁrst arr
rived, but I think the personalities of
the group overcome any dress code
failures, Although I was at ﬁrst thorr
oughly convmccd that there was no
true Grlntlellian who had escaped the
wrath of Playfair, my presumptions
have fallen faster than the average
campus tree. lee ll or not, we have
socialized the freshmen to be exactly
like us. Though they may not long
be under the authorlty of President
“madcap fun” Ferguson, they’ll be
the ones who have lhc opportunity
to learn probability histograms from
her.

Still, as I said before, these fresbr
men are not all the popular and an—
noying frat types we all hated and
dreaded in high school. For instance,
not long ago, I watched a freshman
walk, Mission Impossible style, into
the PEC shower. She crept along,
plastered against the wall, explain-
ing that she didn’t want people to ,
notice her. It is exactly this type of
impossible logic which Grinnelllans
have long been proud of.

The freshmen have also quickly
learned the art of hyperbole. As 56.
niors are well aware, we don’t actue
ally do more work than freshmen, we
have just learned to lie about our
workload in a convincing manner. If
Idid all the work I told my friendsl
was doing, I would average more
than two papers per day and upwards
of73,000 pages ofreadlng per week.
Finally, the freshmen have caught on
to this ploy (a ploy, I might add,
which has successfully convinced
important people writing college
publications that Grinnell has the
second highest workload in the na-
lion). As an example:

Freshman A, August 1997 7 2

be up ALL NIGHT I have to write
an ENTIRE lab report by tomorrow.
(Pause) I am so DEAD. (major fret~
ting ensues here, including furrowed

ents ) '

report by tomorrow. (Pause) Also, I

Frcshntan B. Wall. You Said you

Freshman A: Oh Um. . .I got an

They have learned the devious art
of scratching their ID cards to change

While it’s easy to complain that the
freshman are not quite what we
hoped for, I think it's becoming evi-
denl lhal they have the potential to
bejust as snotty and condescending
in a low years as we have been to
them. Let’s jUSl hope they don’t
