SMART ll OMEN.

Grade ltverilges recelltly compiled and printed ill the
Scarlet and Black reveal us usufll that the Grinnell \Vo»
man is “smarter” than the Gr llell man. Assuming the
average hours oi u-ork‘c ed lly each student to he
fifteen, humble arithmetic shows that the representative
Grinnell coe»e(l is a. B student, whereas her male cou-
temporary can scurcely rate his c. Why is this true?

There are several outstanding reasons. It is a cull-
servutive estimate that 40 percent of the men of Grin-
nell spend from three to five hours daily in work out
side of the curriculum to help earn their Way through
college, Not half of that percentage of girls, with it few
exceptions, spend more than three hours daily for the
same purpose. Also to be subtracted from the total of
men's'hours are those occupied hyrthe practice tor and
actual participation in intercollegiate football and basket
ball. Since there are only twentyrfuur hours in c dav
and Jack as Well as Jill must have time to sleep, eat,
rest, play and attend Classes, the time free for study
plays on important part in What the professors mark in
their grade books.

Then too, there is a. tendency among Women in college,

ENGLISH LEISURE.

The leisurely manner or English education impressed
a. young American woman "somewhat jangled by six
hysterical years of American college existence," according
to the Vassar Miscellany News. A letter published in
that paper shows how forcibly this quality strikes the
visiting Yankee.

The letter avers that she was, alter a few days, taken
into the sanctum. of one oi: the professors 01’ a great
university and given a. little lather-1y advice. The scene
of the interview was a masculine setting in which pipes.
tobacco ashes, (sling tobacco), at small coal hrc, three or
four comfortable chairs and a great jumble or books pro-
vided the setting. .

“What you need to do," said the professor. “is to learn
how to tnke it easy, and get a rest from the barbarous
habits or ten hours a day activities and lectures. Get up
about ninethirty, eat a big hreaktast and go to hear some
music in the utter-noon, two or three times c week we
shall meet here about ﬁve o'clock, have some tea, smoke,
and discuss some matters in English history that have u

ahout London and iecl a hit at home, you can start, in
your work at the British Museum with some or the tutors
who will show you how to use the museums and tell you
something about the source materials or English history.
After a. while, you can begin to think about your thesis.
Then you can live in the eighteenth century, read letters,
and read the hooks him communications of people of that
era until you begin to know them. After that, about the
middle or the year, you (inn begin to write vour tbesi
