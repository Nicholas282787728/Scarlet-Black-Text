Paul nass ,
there appC

at loast one giand
denunciation ot the coil so
drinking rule, that rigid y si
Ltiw or Grnineii. which the
T‘shman ill'SL encounters at
l’egisii'alwn and \l' icli haunts
and disgusts him ior tour long
years atierward.

No one ever says anything
good about the drinking rulC;
it is universall, scorned, utterly
despised, and t tiously stamped
stupid, puritancial and A Bad
Thing.

The rule niiects every “ll-
(lcrgrndunle, but none of them
like it; the 18 students charged
with its eiiiorceinent do so
i-eluotnntiv anti are generally
pitied ior having to do so at
all.

The rule pervades ore - crair
or at the social prograin- what
hail social chairman has not
reviled it upon seeing his carer
hilly—planned open house quick
1_\' degenerate into cocoa-soddcn
boredom, and what student,
sadiy taking his cider at a
I'nion party, has not despoired
or ever having a really good
time?

The drinking rule is not wells
liked.

And this saddens me a hit,
ior I am not among its haters.
True, I once was. But I have
lately given much t ought to
the mattcr, and I have, as
they say, pondered it at great
length, .and l have finally
come to see the logic at it,
There is a good reason tor
the rule, a reason which insti.
iies it, a reason which ought
to make its existence more
tolerable to every quivering,
dehydrated Crinnellian.

The reason, probably too ob-
vious for anyone to have hit
upon betore, is that there is not,
in our iair city, a single decent
place to di-inkl Not a one! And
i honestly believe that our
drinking rule stems from a de-

on the part at the college
oi ends to keep its students
lrom frequenting the miserable
pubs with‘ which Grinncll
abounds.

’Granting that a tavern need
not be clean and u'ellrllghied to
be habitable. and even that a
certain air of dingtness adds to
its’chai'acle, i still maintain
that not one of Grinnell's half-
dozen or so even approaches
quaintness, Thcy arc singularly
sordid, greasy and ipiplcasont,
patronized largely by lccring
Snopcses and their leather
jacketed progeny, polluted with
bad music, and accoutercd with
dirty glasses They are, 1 think,
dismal places in which to tippic.

And the administration. in
laying down the drinking rule,
has at all times kept this in
mind, Oil-campus drinking by
minor has been discouraged,
as has been the iinportat n oi
drink to tiic dormitories . . .
all with it view toward keep-
ing the Grinncllian out oi
those ugly novcls.

This

praised, docs have several
