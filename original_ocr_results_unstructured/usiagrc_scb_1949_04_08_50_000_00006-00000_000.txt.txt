APRIL 8 1949

By Steve Irving

in the recent “most eligible
bachelor" election held on cams
pus, the two representatives of
virility who came out on the
heavy end of the vote were for-
rner politician Stu Roeder, edi-
tor of Zephyr, and Bill O’Brien,
Bray housemother. Considering
Bill's duties at Bray house, one
could say he‘s leading a rather
full life.

Questions were put to the
eligibles, and here are the re-
sults:

What was your firstu-eaction
to the news of your victory over
m others at your sex?

O‘Brien: At first, I thought it
was all a joke. but when 1 dis
covered it was true, i was very
pleasantly surprised.

Roedcr: How many electrons
can one man lose? But this one
embarrassed hell out of my
kids. Seriously, I want to thank
everyone who voted for me; 1
wish I knew who they were.

How long‘ do you intend to
remain a bachelor?

NSA Offers Many Opportunities
For Betterment of Student Life

By Kay Swal‘tz

How would you like to take
your girl to the movie and have
enough money left over from
the admission for two bags of
popcorn? 0r galsiwhat would
you think of buying a new suit
and saving enough on it tor a
hat? That’s no pipe dream, but
just one of the many things
NSA can accomplish.

There’s more. For instance,
maybe the NSAesponsored leads
ership training program can
make you into a wheel from a
little cog. Or if that doesn’t
suit you, perhaps you’d go for
reduced travel rates, more DP
students on campus, round»
tabling with UNESCO notables,
or rating teachers.

Dick Berkley, Grihnell’s Nair
ional Student Association chair.
man, says it can be done. He’s
not making any promises, but
committees are investigating pos-
sibilities of establishing each of
these goals on _our campus. The
one which looks nearest at hand
at present is the introduction of
the purchase card system. In
Chicago and other cities in
which it is already in effect,
students who bought these one
dollar cards are entitled to dis-
counts ranging from 10 to 20%
at the stores which have con—
tracted with NSA. Contact with
merchants, restaurants, and other
businesses will be made here in
the hope of getting student dis-
counts, but regardless of Grin.
nell agreements, cards will be
sold so students may use them
this summer where the system
is in etfect.

All students here are members
of NSA through the Student
Council affiliation and are rep—
resented in the United Nations.
An NSA representative is the
only student who sits on the
UNESCO executive board; it is
in connection with this that Don
Snook, Langan senior, and an.
other Grinnellian will go to the
Cleveland conference in April.

If you favor turning the tables
and Want students to grade
teachers, NSA offers suggestions.

O'Brien' indefinitely.

Roeder Permanently.

What is your ideal woman?

O’Brien: She must be able to
read, write, and speak seven
languages, six of which are not
neccssarily particular, but the
seventh must be French, to help
me pass the qual. She should be
either tall, slender, and sincwy,
or short, stocky, and substan-
tial. Nothing in between. There
are enough ideal figures in the
world already.

Roeder: she must be a blend
of Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall.
and Liz Scott, with a dash of
my old secretary, who was a
lady of singular talents.

Can you give any words of
advice to the lasers?

O‘Brien: when out on a date,
a fellow should think, talk, and
have fun and laughsfhave a
good time. Save the serious dis-
cussions tor seminars.

Roeder: The thing for bachen
lots to remember is that the

sound of a kiss is not so loud'
as the roar of a Cannon~but its
echo lasts much longer.
