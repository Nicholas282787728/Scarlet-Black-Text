The increased liberalizarion or rrade under rhe WTO
has negarive eitecrs on rhe environmenr, labor, public healrh
and local economies. Furthermore, rheWTo promorcs irs
iree rrade agendain a “behind closed doors.” highly un-
democraric manner. Trade minisrers and corporare execu»
rives comprise rhe WTO’s decision making body and pro-
more privare capiral accumularion while disregarding local
inrcresrs. Such unaccounrabiliry rcpresenrs rhc grcaresr chal-
lenge ro rhe crcarion ota peoplecenrered world order.

For example, when Massachuscrrs sancrioned rhe un-
democratic government of Burma in 1997, the European
Union (as one oilsurma's rrading parrners) med suir wirh
rhe WTO againsr Massachuserrs over losr marker access.
The WTO ruled in favor orrhe EU‘s supporr oi an un»
democraric governmenr, and forced Massachuserrs ro open
irs markers ro Burma's rrading parrncrs, in rhis case we see
rhar rhai rhc WTO is nor aceounrable re the values ofmem-
bersrares, or rheir citizens. IftheWTO existed during sourh

To rhe Editor.

I have some ouesrions tor rhe srudcnrs that signed a
peririon concerning rhe “Eddyvlllc Dunes."

Have you ralked wirh rhe DOT and heard rheir side or
rhe sroryas to whar errorrs have been made ro preserve rhe
Dunes?

What percenrage orrhe Orchidsare being desrioyed by
rhc placemenr otrhe highway?

Have you spoken wirh any orrhe previous land owners
abour how rhe land was used and was rhere any concern by
anyone abour die environmcnral impact?

was rhe Ciry Council or Mayor ofEAdyvillc consulred
about their view on the Duncs?

Has anyone rold you rhe ornare BoxTurtle in rhis area
are nor reproduction? I don’t believe any female or young
rurrles have been round.

It is very easy for people ro sign a peririon working oit
rheir immediare emotional response. I believe before any
one signs a peririon rliey should be conscious orall aspecrs
orrhe issue.

All i am asking for is a rair assessmenr aher looking ar
borh sides otrhe issue.

The building orrhe highway has made us aware orrhe
special species in rhis area. With rhe building orrhe high»
way rhc DOT is serring aside a prorecred area For rhese
species. 1 think ir would be a nice gesrure it rhe environs
menral groups used rheir esperrise in helping develop dais
area,

1 don’r know oranyone having an inreresr in rhe dune
area unril rhe highway was proposed. 1r is nor like people
were nor aware ofthese species being in rho area.

saving rhc dunes species have become a stop rhe high.
way movemenr.

Last bur nor leasr is rhe sarery issues wirh rhe delay or
consrrucrion. Come ro our town and sec along side rhe
grade school 7 you will be amazed by rhe amounr otrramc
we live wirh.

Tirade of the ‘

By Andrew Civettini

I’ve spenr rhe lasr week or my lire doing norhing
bur reading and wriring abour rhe Homesread Sreei
Strike or 1892, so pardon me ifI reel gushy abour
labor for a moment.

Okay, that’s cnough. I’ve ﬁnished. (You didn’t cx-
pccr a poiiricai rirade calling for some mass move.
menr did you, because alrhough l have grear respecr
tor rhose rhar rackle such issues rhey are beyond my
poiiricai acriviry level, laborsrruggles have never been
and probably will nor likely be a cenrral tacror in my
pulirical “per peeve" lisr.The biggesr rhingon rlie list
is rhird parry access and all rhe grear issues that come
along with that: campaign finance, ballor access, dc.
barc access, primary access, ere,

Okay, so what it boils down to here is that the
rwo major parries have made ir near impossible for
grass—mots parrics based on acrual sranees ru gain foot»
holds. If you’re nor willing ro rake my word for ir,
pick up a copy of Bob Roth’s A RtLtrrt iii Vere.

The conrenrion rhar my colleague Mr. Rorhschild
made lasr week rhar rhe Reform Party would “gum
up rhe sysreni" borhers me, but nor because i have
myrhical romanricizarion or rhe Reform Party as a
third party.

No, I believe that Mr. Rothschild has touched
upon a grearcr problem, wherher consciously or nor-
people rhink rhird parries are wasred vorcs rliar wreelr
rhe abiliry orrlie rwo.parry sysrern to crcarc progress
(whatever that is). Try 251 may, 1 could never underc
srand rhe argumenr that Casting a vore (even support-
ers of rhird parries are cunsrirurionally guaranreed
suffrage) tor any candidare would be a wasre. Thar
vote could be based on that candidate’s stands on is-
sues, hair color, propensiry ro speak wirh a sourhern
drawl, wharever, regardless orparry arriiiarion. As ir
is, rhis is a parriciparory democracy (1 use rhis rcrm
liberally) where our righr to easr a vore how we see hr
is sacred. So, itrhe Reform Parry gums up rhe Sys»
rem, rhen ir is supposed to, given our currcnr finance
laws.

As scary as ir is, if people are willing ro supporr
Buchanan rhen rliey deserve ro vore rhar way, nor be
lulled Republican when rhe Republicans do nor reps
[:Scnt thcm, Who carts ifthcy can't win? Just because
rhe propensiry tor a rhird parry, especially one rhar is
nur grassroots orienred, ro survive and win many sears
in a major national election IS low, don’t Fret The
hallotraccess laws that Serve its Goliath to third par-
ries may be slior down in rhe coming decade, (I can
dream,can't1))

Complerely unrelared (I don‘r rhink my ropics are
cvcr relared anymore) is anorlier marrer. Massive
amounts of congratulations are due to the Women's
soccer Team for winning rlie conrerence champion-
ship and going so narionals congrarularions are also
in order for the Club \Vilter Polo Team, Sixth in the
nation among Division ill schools is quite an achieve»
mcnt, and I have as much respect for athletics as i
have for poiiries,

I just don't have as many opinions aboiir athlet-
