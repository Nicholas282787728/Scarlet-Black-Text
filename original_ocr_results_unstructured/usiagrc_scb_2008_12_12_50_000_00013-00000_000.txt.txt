m'JalG/tm

After starting off the season winless
through their ﬁrst seven games, include
ing two losses cailier during her weekend
to conference foes, the Grinnell women's
basketball team captured their ﬁrst victory
of the season on Wednesday night against
Knox College.

“This win meant a lot for us. physicals
ly, inentnlly ind eniotionnlly," Guntd Jodi
Watkins '09 said. "We had been 077 and we
worked really hard in practice. this win was a
pay orrtor the hard work that we put in."

Last weekend. the women’s basket
ball team traveled to Wisconsin to face off
against conference foes Beloit College and
Ripon College.

Against Beloit the team jumped out to
an early 21713 lead in the ﬁrst half thanks
to an 1874 run that began when Brianna
Gallo ’11 made one from the charity strips.
The tides turned quickly however, and Ben
loit countered the Pioneers With a 2274
run of their own to go into hnlrtinre with u
lotpoint edge.

After going on a 7,2 run Grinnell pulled
within five of the Buccaneers in the second
halfwhen Mallory Scharf'll hit a layup to
make 37—32,but that was as close as they got
and Beloit captured the victory 59-41.

Against Ripon, the team fell behind early
18-2 and could not recover for the rest or"
half, as they went into the locker room down
45-25. Though the team played stronger in
the second half, the deficit was too large to
overcome and they last 8552,

Going into Wednesday night's game
against Knox College, the team was optie
mistic that they could capture their ﬁrst vict

tory ofthe season. “Knox is not a very highly
ranked team and it was out ﬁrst home game
in a month, those two factors gave us more
conﬁdence," sehnirsnid. “we’ve been playe
ing on the mod in Wisconsin, we were n11
pumped for the gnrne."

Though the Pioneers were favored to
win the game, the Prairie Fire were the ones
who jumped out enily, leading by as much
as seven in the ﬁrst half. But the Pioneers
began to wash away the Prairie Fire's ino-
mentum as the half closed down, ending the
hnlttlown by one 32-31. "We try to come
out the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of every half and
mike a big spurt,” Scharfsaid. “Betnuse that
momentum travels the rest of the game,"

Out of the gates, Jessica Shorts ’10 sank
a jumper to put the Pioneers ahead by one,
Knox proceeded to tie the game up twtcc
before the Pioneers took Command of the
game, going on n 12-4 run on their way
to 7440 win. Guard Jodi Watkins ‘09 led
Grinnell with 13 points and Scharf added in
12 points. Gallo contributed on both ends of
the court getting {our steals to go along with
11 points and four assists.

"When people are losing they start to
blame themselves and each other but we had
to stay together is a term.” Scherfonid, “on
Wednesday that really came out, we had four
people in double ﬁgures it was team effort
and a! the end ofthe day when you win no
one is going to care about individual stats,"

Over winter break, the team will face
off against Carroll College and St. Norbert
College on Jan 16 and Jan 17 it Darby; feel
free to come back early and support the Pio-
neers.
