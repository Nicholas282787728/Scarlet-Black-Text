What are you doing?
Don’t you have four
cumulative exams, two
oral presentations, and
three research papers all
due within minutes of
each other? I can't
believe that you are
reading the newspaper
while your academic
world crumbles around
youl Shouldn’t you be on
Burling fourth
attempting to learn the
entire history of China or
at least actively trying to
get the flu before
Monday?
Wait. Don't ﬂip out. I am

A: Much like seeing any goat come through in the eluteh, the
Harris staffstepped up when it counted the most. last weekend, X-
Men went offwithout 2 hitch. It must have been all of the pressure
this campus is feeling due to the onset of finals, but l'm thinking
Harris only does its best with the most on the line, On the other
hand, they could have realized there was only one ﬁlm and that
took a lot ofrhe pressure off, Either way, it was all about pressure.
And this week? Well, the pressure remains.
Finals are elosor. Tempers are closer to erupt.

that our worst enemy is
really our best rn'end.
That's right, stress is key
in surviving. In my
mind, it is a more potent
and powerful form of
motivation that propels
you through your exams
and presentations
despite the cries of your
physical body. Without
an uber-motivating
factor like stress, I am
unable to complete my
assignments. If the
stress is taken away so
is that muchrneeded
feeling of urgency and
impending doom.

For this reason, hell
week is all the worse
because my favorite
incentive to do work, the
possible advent of the
academic apocalypse, is
constantly being
suppressed by a long and
steady string of study
breaks and stress-
relievers.

How can I possibly write
a IO-page research paper
on an impossibly
complex topic when 1

re 've bouncy halls and
mini-parachute men in
the mail that demand
hours of my time? How
can I learn to integrate
exponential functions
when there are only 20
minutes of dead time
between the showing of
Sixteen Candles and the
start of the pancake
social? How am I
supposed to concentrate
fully at the library when
masked men keep
throwing Twix bars at
me?

It seems all too
possible that I somehow
warped into a parallel
Grinnellian universe
where we get ice cream
sundae; instead of exams
and snap bratelets
instead of phone bills.
With all of the stress
relievers on campus
during the last two
weeks of class, it’s a
wonder that I remember
that it is finals week at
all.

(poor Vincent D’Onofrio can’t play a regular person ever) to find
clues as to the location ofhis latesrvierim. Vince Vaughn supports.

A: All righr, while this film is “visually imaginative," it does lack
an important aspect that every moviegoer deserves a flow. I got so
weirded out by this dude’s head, that the rest of the story didn’t
matter, lt's nevcr good to put all your eggs in one basket, but this
ﬁlm relies solely on its ability to shock you with rhe latest special
effects. While I'm all for near streets, I need romrrhr'ng to link these
scenes together. And Jennifer Lopez ain't it.

P: l’m the first to admit that the “outside D'onofrio’s head"
parts are serviceable at most. Burl think that the art direction and
design inside his messedup gourd more than make up for it. This
is one of the few recent films (561201 and Aliens are others) that actu»
ally ﬁlled me with dread for what was going to happen next. Also,
foryou detail hunters (like one Mr Naniiani, who pointed this out
afrer we saw this), keep a close eye on rhc background nfeharaeters
living spaces. Many ofthe details ofthe killer's home, for instance,
are taken to crtremes in his fantasy world. The plot may be per.
functory, the psychology and neuroscience may be as, bur director
Tarsem (who also did REM’s “Losing my Religion" video) puts to.
gether a fascinating world for his camera to explore.

A: I guess music videos is where he gen the whole idea ofall.
visual no.plot filmmaking. And I bet he’s raking in the bucks. Darrin

F: Ben stiller is at his smarmy best in this slice ofearly.9os life.
Low point: that 4 Noanlondes song that you used to get stuck in
your head in Ninth Grade.

A: This made Winona Ryder a star. l’m still questioning why.
but at least they got the angst right.

Wednesday: Pretty in Pink

A: This one almost made me move to Shermet, lllinois. But
you know what i found out when i got there? There is no Shctmer,
lllinois. Movies are bullshit.

F: Another brat Pack flick from John Hughes. 'Molly Ringwald
ignores fellow wotiungnclass bud John cryer to go after that now-
careerless dope Andrew McCarthy.

Thursday: Wayne} World

F: This is What SNL movie. We all grew up on it and quote
it, and we should all go see it and relive lines like “I don't even own

a— gun, let alone many guns which would necessitate an entire rack.”

Music to Make you Look Better

Jenni and Rachel’s light-hearted radio show focuses on fun

by Ben Meade
Siofi Wriier

Rachel Lieberman ‘01 and Jenni Wu’s ‘03 radio
show is ofﬁcially called “Music to Make You Better
Looking." However, in the short time I spent inter»
viewing this DJing duo l discov»
cred many of the shows unoffir
tlal titles. “Music to Give You
Social Anxiety Disorder" is one of
Rdtl's favorite pseudonyms for the
show. In addition, when topping
with each other off the air, Jenni
Jokingly called it “The Jenni is
Awesome Show, starring Jenni
and Featuring Rachel." Further-
more, theyarc considering nam-
ing their next episode “Girls Gone
Wild, Music to Make You HOT!"
But, even with all these ultCrnJ-
two titles, Jenni made was sure to
spell one thing out to me, “This
show is iiorcnllcd ‘Music lo Make
You Smarter".

Indeed, siith a rule would be inappropriate, and
not because Jenni and Rachel art- unmtclligcnr, but
because their show rs all about breaking away from
the typical grind omnnnell college academia. “our

breaking away from the

saying, “You really just

Though Rachel and Jenni

ﬁnds related artists online at CDNow and plays what.
ever similar albums she has available.

But CDNow is not the only
website that the girls visit while host.
ing their show. Often, the pair will go
to the J, Crew website while on the
air. Thus, “Music to Make You better

is hosts have a genuine interest in and
knowledge ofelothing. In one ottheir

that translates over the airwaves to their listening an.
