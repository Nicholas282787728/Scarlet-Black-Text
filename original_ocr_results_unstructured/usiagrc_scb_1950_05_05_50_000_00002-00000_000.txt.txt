SCARLET AND BLACK

There are many quaint, deseci'atcrl relics on tlle Gi'in—

nell college campus, which is

These vestiges

of a proud past per aps have been preserved for nostalgla‘s
sake, and though they are not always as pleasing to prying
eyes as they are on picture postcards, they whistle ill the
wind on stormy nights, and seem to lend a melancholy if

not sobering influence to our

college campus.

But the loneliest, and most desolate structure on cam-
pus is Herrick Chapel during Thursday morning chapel seiu
Vices. And this is somewhat of a paradox, for not only do
we have one of the most beautiful and soul-comforting icolv

lege chapels in the country, but we are privileged to take.

part in one of the most lfertile sources of academic, spl lt-
ual, and artistic inspirations available to college students.
We of Gl‘innell are proud of the noiircolnpulsory‘ feature
of our religious program and of the facilities oﬂered to
those who may obtain a fuller and happier llie through it.

But the disturbing" question

of chapel attendance raises

itself, and this is not merely an ethical problem, nor is it ‘
peculiar to Grinnell college; the solution can only be found

when we ask ourselves if it's

tion of our spiritual directions.

LeHers to The
Editor

The phrase “ivory tower" has
grown to be as much abused as
a blanket on the first day oi
Spring. A fellow just isn’t a
good riprsnorting, red-blooded
reformer unless he takes a few
pot shots at the barely deten-
sible residents of any nearby
"ivory tower.” According to the
“ripsnorting” denunciations ct
our little reformers, the quaint
”ivory tower" is so jammed with
humanity that one is constant-
ly amazed how the “outside"
world ever manages to conduct
its incredibly vital business.

Tell me, ML Murphy, just
what is this metaphorical ivory
tower you so glihly condemn?
(I trust you are speaking met-
aphorically), You sny its rcsi.
dent is one who "isolates"
himself from societyia sort
of intellectual aloofness. is
that what you detest? A per-
son ordained with intelligence
allowing it to dissipate with
non-activity? Just what solur ,
tion do you offer? Shall we
implore all of these lethargic,
siowiy degenerating dwellers
in the clouds of inattention to ,
fling themselves bodily into
“local, national, and internar
tionnl afrairs‘Z" That would be
splendid: But where is their
place in our society? Have you
found a niche for them yet?
Perhaps you would insist that
they descend from their lofty ,
perch and cntcr your world or ‘

crisis" on the back of a sick.
iy donkey or a rcncorous ele-
phant, Or would you cast
them into society as “independ-
ents" and pit them against
such bloodthirsty dcmcgogues
as Mr. MacCarthy, or Mr.

Rankin, or Mn Hickenluoper?

Perhaps an intelligent individr
us] is morally required to thrust
himself into society; but is this
always necessary at the only too
often blnntantly superficial stage
of politics and “public“ affairs?
Must we all publicly prattle and
lards who will contribute little
more than a few equally barren
prate at the myriads of worldly
injustices like so many unisonic
magpies‘? The more we prattle
the worse things get, the louder
we rant and the more confused
WE are about what we started
to rant about to begin with, I
have no intention of condoning
the actions of those social dul—
progcny to our distraught little
world, but can you honestly
shove this residue into a lofty
white spire? '

You call the “ivory tower"
a dangerous “school of philoso—

phy." But is it really? How
many grcat works hove cmcrg-
cd from the solitudc you dop-
recate‘7—works that bonciit the

world and make it a better
place in which to live.

It appears that the biggcr the
World gets, and the more involv-
ed we get, and the more vehem~
cntly we crusade. the muddier
everything becomes. So why not
give the "ivory tower" a chance,
Mn Murphy? it might fool you.

‘Glass Menagerie’ to Start Monday

illustrate this
Voyles quoted Tennesse Wllr
lioms' introduction to The 61355
Menagerie. ”The play is meme
ory, and being memory, it is
therefore nonri-calistic, for mem-
nry omits some details and ex—
aggerates others.” Voylcs ex-
plained. “It is like a dream: when
you wake up. you remember only
some parts of it.” The action in
this type of play is thereiore a1,—
ways changing, with some parts
being sharply defined, quick,
and clear, while others are more
vague and difiused, similar to
recalling something from meme
ory.

Vince Yager, Dibble senior, is
playing the Gentleman Caller.

the male lead in Sartre’s No
