Sarah Moss '06 wins Bacon
House $10,000 scholarship

Sarah Moss ’06 round out that she had won a 310,000 scholars
ship when a friend left a congratulatory message on her answer
ing machine. “I was screaming and starting jumping up and down,"
Moss said. “I think I freaked out my ﬂoor mates because 1 was so
loud.Then 1 called my parents."

Moss won a scholarship offered by the Diplomatic and Consuls
ate omcers, Retired (DACOR) Bacon House, which will contrlh»
ute 310,000 toward her future study in international law. 55,000 for
her rust two semesters will go directly toward paying for tuition.
Moss is a Russian and Political Science double major, and a member
orEmanate. She has also worked as are for Helpdesk.

Wayne Moyer, Political science, first sparked Moss interest in
international relations when she took one ofhis classes. Her inter»
est solidiﬁed after exposure to Russian culture during a visit to st.
Petersburg. This experience also inspired her successful essay in her
application for the DACOR scholarship.

Even with a large scholarship to look forward to, Moss isn’t can
ger to leave Grinnell. “1 am going to miss the kindness of the people
here," she said. “There are so many people here who are insightful,
thoughtiul and passionate."Moss was accepted by Washington Uni»
versity in st. Louis Law School and University ofIllinois Urbana-
Champaign Law School.

After
school, Moss
said the first

ness is practi-
cal. “[1'm goo
ing to] get a
job to pay off
my loans,” she
said. “I want

ment because I am interested in diplomacy and drafting treaties.

Moss had other ambitions. “When I was little, I wanted to join
the FBI. I guess I was inﬂuenced by the ‘men in black’ and the alien
conspiracies,” she said. “As I matured, so did my rationale."

Moss said that the support from DACOR was very meaningful
for her. “I am so gratehrl not only for the free money but because a
group or former ambassadors, consulate ofﬁcers and diplomats have
etpressed their conﬁdence that I can and ultimately will rum my
dreams," Moss said.

Grinnell’ S Truman streak

Katie Jares ’07 wins a Truman Scholarship, Grinnell 5
second win in a row after suffering a 15- -year drought

Educating inmates is
rough, and as Katie Jares ’07
recognizes, few people are
willing to do thejob.

Iares, the recent recipis
ent of the Truman Scholar
ship, plans to dedicate her
career to educating and im-
proving the Iives of inmates.
“People don’t care about
reforming that system," said
Jares by phone from Aus
tralia, where she is studying.
“It is something that is very important to me."

The Harry Truman scholarship is a 330,000 graduate school
scholarship, awarded to 75 college juniors planning to dedicate
themselves to public service. The scholarship also includes leads
ership training and college counseling After completing graduate
school, the scholars are required to work in the public service indus-
try for three to seven years.

Jares is committed to working in the prison system,but has dis
covered a new range of graduate school possibilities with the aid of
the scholarship.

"It has deﬁnitely opened a lot of doors for me as far as where I

want to go to graduate school," explained Jares. “I still very much
plan on working inside a prison and five to 10 years after that form-
ing a nonproﬁt volunteer corps."

Deciding on a graduate school should be much a simpler pro
cess than the scholarship application ms.The Truman Scholarship
demands a lot of its nominees. In order to simplify the process,
Grinneii‘s Director of Social Commitment Doug Cutchins created
a system in which the college’s four nominees met once a week to
work on the application.

“It is like you have an additional class," explained Jares. During
the fall semester of2005 the four nominees met each Friday to dis
cuss application questions, as well as receive advice from administra-
tors and professors.

Although rates is currently studying abroad in Australia, before
the semester is over she will have returned twice in order to his
terview for and accept the scholarship. When she was chosen as a
ﬁnalist she came back for an interview on March 10 and will return
again to accept the scholarship on May 12.

Despite the hassle. Jares is thrilled by the opportunities before
her and is ready to begin helping inmates. “There are a lot of people
addressing aids, and education, because everyone loves helping kids,”
explains Jares. “I’m interested in helping [inmates] achieve a better
life. ”

the developing world and traditional liberal causes like environmen-
talism. Despite his progressive oudook, he is glad to receive money
in the name ora man once synonymous with American conserva—
tism. “It’s not actually his money," said Henry.

in Australia this semester, did not respond to c-mails and a phone
call requesting information by press time.

one Grinnellian has received the award almost every year for the
past fifteen yearsThere were no winners last year.

323 scholarships were awarded this year out of 1,081 nominees.

per year. Over the past 18 years, the scholarship has given about 43
million dollars to 4,885 students.

tcrested in diseases such as HIV, malaria and niberculosis. He said
these diseases affect the most people in the world and yet receive
relatively little funding to treat or cure them. He has worked for
both Greenpeace and Free the Planet.
