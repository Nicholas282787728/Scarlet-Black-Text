We notice by a recent newspaper
that New York city students are
no ing their way through school by
taking millionaires' dogs walking.
What about letting some deserving
student play nursermaid to Pavvy and
Rascal, Mr. Stoops, it they promise
not to go past the dorms. Price—
two for a. quarter. \

What are these reports of Building
Two? Seems that the children are
returning to their nursery rhyme
days. Isn't there one that starts out
“Ride a cook horse~” and another.
“Cockleidnodle—dotﬂ”

Spring has come! Signs of {mar

pearing in the quad. For further the
tails read the “What Do You Think”
column in tonight's paper.

And now that the men are being
campused, we wonder which part of
the evening Roscoe Husband objected
to moreibelng in at seven—thirty, or
spending the night with Jim Infelt?

Wonder ully Dean Findlay doe 't
try to discover what makes (:hiick

Prince Albert:

“You‘re a sentimental sweetie

Sitting here so all alone
His hearts this green with envy
And beats just like a stone.

Why should a man with work to do
Sit down and waste his time
By writing to his lady
A silly little rhyme.
But when hours are cold and blue—
Man‘s a funny thing."
(Editor’s note: the MS. of the above
was found in several fragments in the
bottom or at Clark hall waste basket.)

"Here they come,” said some one
near the door.

Mount and Langfeldt entered the
room, took their respective positions,

CONDENSED STATEMENT

Our main grievances are;

i. The League Board s tar as We
can see, nlamllllctilre rules as the
spirit moves it. (Why not try n perin-
anent set of rules?)

2. New rules are not voted on by
the girls at mass meetings.

3. The students have no way at
knowing what the present rules are
until they are practiced on some poor
unsuspecting victim.

4. There is too much partiality. A
low girls are used as examples; the
others so free.
