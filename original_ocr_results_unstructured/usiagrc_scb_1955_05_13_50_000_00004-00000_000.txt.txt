when, in 1949, Eastman Kn-
ﬂak 00. introduced a new pro-
cess for making color prints,
called “Hexiclu’omq” Fayman
began to experiment with this
process as a new form of m
cxpl'esclon. So far as is known,
he is the pioneer in this par-
ﬁcular ﬁeld, and this exhibit
oi Flexiehrome prints is his
I" st collection made for ex-
hibiting purposes.

Fayman, Whose home is La
Jolla, California, began actually
to participate in photography as
an amateur in 1940; then in
1943 he decided to attend 'tlle
Art Center school in Los Ange
les, where he studied camou-
ﬂage and photography,

This, combined with his cola
loge training in art at Kansas
State College, has led to his re-
cent interest in trying to bring
abaula betler general undErr
standing of art in photography.

A separate showing of these
prints is being circulated on a
year's tour of the United States
and Canada in the Photographic
Society of America's “Tops in
Photography, 1954" exhibit, that
began in February, 1954i
