Amana Colonies bring German fair to Iowa

 

 

Iowa community hosts its own Oktoberfest, drawing thousands, during first weekend of October for 44 years and running

BY CAROLYN SCHOLZ

Germany is more than beet, nnd the Amnna
Colonies are more than small villages.

Originally founded by a group or inirlr
ful Christian immigrants from Germany, the
Amana Colonies lie roughly 60 miles east of
Grinnell.

Ever since 1965, every ﬁrst weekend ofOc-
tober they have hosted a festival with march-
ing bands, beer and an abundance of blue and
white decorations. Dubbed “little bit ofBavaria
in Iowa,” the festival is Amana's own Oktobere
fest, a German festiwil held in Munich, often
described as “the world’s largest fair."

Even though the Oktoberfest in the Amana
Colonies are not nearly as old as the real Okme
berfest, its custom is already ﬁrmly established,
with some visitors making their way to the
colonies every yenr.

“It’s a tradition," n group from northern
Iowa said. “We come every year."

For those involved, the experience starts far
before October.

“We start practicing eight weeks before
the Oktoberfest for our only gig," said Randy
Kinder, the drummer of the band Die Tiefen-

Keller, said. “That’s how we’ve been doing it for
32 years."

Attendance has increased steadily through
out the years, with last year setting the highest
tally yet.

“We hadjust over 35,000 visitors [in 2008]."
said John, an Amana local. “This year we're ch
pecting nearly as muchﬂt least 25,000."

The annual event is great for business in the
small villages ofthe Amana Colonies, as thou-
sands of festival goers come from every direc-
tion with money to spend.

“The Saturday ofthc Oktoberfest is getter
ally our biggest business dny ofthe whole year,"
nn employee of the Amana General Store said
“We were praying for good weather.)

Unwelcome rain may have stopped some
from coming out this year, but rhere was still
plenty people dedicated enough to drive from
other states.

“We came all the way from Lenexa, Kane
sas,"a inurried couple in their mid-50s omen
man ancestry, said. “It is lots offun, not as good
as Germany, but close. The same goes for the
beer."

Beer, a central focus of Oktoberfest, is off

{cred in plenty ofvarier'les, with the Amana-
homebrewed beer being the most popular. But
it is not just the beer that drnws people to the
Oktoberfest.

“I come her for the Deutsche experience,"
an unnamed Germany-lover from Iowa ciry
said."Plus it's the only German Celebration I’ve
ever been to. It’s funithe folks here are hnving
a lot offun.”

Unfortunately, this is Iowa, not Germany, as
is evident by the relative lack of lederhosen and
dirndlsr The “Willkommen” or “Welcome" at
the front entrance does its best to set the festive
mood. Rcyrdless, there will be critics, includ-
ing Grinnell Student Jacob Gjesdahl '10, who
lived in Bavaria for over yeor

When asked his opinion, Gjesdahl respondr
ed, “Net authentisch," or in our Iowan dialect,
"not authentic."

Nevertheless, the festival is German enough
for the thousands ofpeople who frequent every
year.As long as they keep holding it,visitors will
surely come for the ﬁrst weekend in October to
drink, eat and be entertained. It‘s a little escape
from the Midwest without even leaving lown.
