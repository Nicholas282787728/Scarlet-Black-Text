Smoking Committee
considers changes

Howard B Horn

OSSIBLE changes in the
P smoking policy on campus

were discussed in a joint
meeting of the Smoking Task Force
subcommittees yesterday.

The meeting was the ﬁrst time the
two subcommiuces got together this
yeartodiscussthepolicychangcs they
hope to recommend to President Pam
Ferguson at the end of the year.

Fach subcommittee addressed its
possible policy recommendations to
the whole committee for debate. The
Smoking Task Force for Residential
Life, chaired by Nadeem Siddiqui,
AssistantDireciDrofDinningServices,
recommended the transformation of
two or three dorms to nonsmoking,

This recommendation is in re»
sponse to concerns addressed at the
open forum lastmonth. Several stu-
dents from Smith Hall (Currently the
only hall that is completely non-smok-
ing on campus) complained that they
must live in Smith all four years at

environment This is especially prob—
lemalic for students with special health
needs. ResidentLife Coordinators are

being briefedon thepolicysothatthey
can talk Willi theirstudent staffto gage
their opinions.

Tom Brozoski, a psychology
professor,Chairof the Smoking Task
Force Subcommittee on Academic
and Administrative Buildings sub-
mitted several proposals. One pro—
posal is that smoking be prohibited
in all academic and administrative
buildings, with the possible excep-
tion that a designated smoking area
be established in an administrative
building that unanimously decides
to create one. Another proposal is
thatmore“nosmoking"signsbeput
up and that smoking receptacles be
placed at all building entrances. A
final proposal suggested by the sub
committee is that the administration
implement more programs to en-
courage faculty and staff to quit
smoking. These recommendations
are aresultof complaints by faculty
membersaboutsecond-handsmoke.

Another possible change in the
smoking policy on campus is out of
thehands of thesubcommittees. The
Iowa State legislature is strongly
considering a ban on smoking in all
restaurants. This would mean that
smoking would be banned at the
Forum Grilland Bob'sUnderground.
Also, Congress is considering a ban
on smoking in all public places.

 

HEN I saw that two out
of twelve questions in
Ellen Roscnbcrg's“Life
101"discussionwere nbouteating,it
really emphasized the need for this
type of group on campus,“ Loose
RLC Lori Smoker recalls. Lori is a
member of the Committee for Stu~
dent Health and has recently started
weekly caring awareness meetings.
The idea for Ihe meetings grew
from the interest of several students
concemed for themselves as well as
their friends, and the realization that
no counseling group for these dis-
eases was presently on campus.

Smoker stresses that these dis-

for the disorders, but instead a sup—
port group where students can share
information, experiences, frustraa
lions, and ideas on how to cope. She
also comments that there is no com-
mitment, and the meetings are come
plctely conﬁdential and as anony-
mous as possible. Basic informa-
tion about eating disorders as well as
ways to identify them will be in-
cluded in the discussions, and
Smoker hopes to create posters for
the dorm bathroomsand PEC locker
rooms on these subjects as well. A
