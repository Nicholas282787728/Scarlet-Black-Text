THE SENIOR PLAY.

“An American Citizen“ isthe
title of the play to be given by
the Seniors on Tuesday evening
of commencement week. It is a
modern play of tour acts and
while not so heavy a production
as a Shakespearian play yet it will
prove interesting throughout. It
is a story of an American citi-
zen. Crnger by name, who by re-
nouncing his allegiance to Ameri-
ca, becoming an English subject
and marrying an English woman
could come into possession ot a
large legacy. Two days before
the time limit the ﬁrm of Barbury,
crugcr & Brown becomes bank,
rupt by the abseondence of the
junior member of the Firm. The
manner in which Mr. Cruger fill-
ﬁlled the conditions of the will
revived the ﬁrm's credit, failed
again and yet again gained his
feet, form a most interesting story.
The play has been cast and the
members are doing most faithful
woik in practice under Miss Hold-
en. Considerable ability isbeing
developed in the presentation of
the various characters and the
play promises to be a success in
every way.

“An American Citizen” has
been very successtully played by
Mr. Nat C. Goodwin, assisted by
Maxine Elliott. Mr. Goodwin
will be present in the leading role
in “The Alter of Friendship” at
Foster’s in Des Moines to-morrow
evening.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, MAY 20,1903.

STATE HIGH SCHOOL MEET.

The time is at hand for the
moment of supreme interest for
Grinnell people in the year’s
athletics. on Friday morning
and afternoon occurs the one
great event of the year [or 10er
College people as well as for the
athletes who are to come to our
town for the day. The college
works for the High School Meet
as it would for itgown. and the
efforts put forth by the track
management in behalf of the
day are sure to result propitious-
ly. Grinriell’s reputation for
lrnowing how meets-should be rtln
will be sustained.

it is conﬁdently expected that
Ward Field track will be in its
very best condition. With good
weather to favor the programme
nothing can prevent the day from
being one of splendid success.
Even a hard rain storm will have
a mininurn bad effect on the con~
dition of the track. The smooth
hard surface of Cinders assures us
of this.

Nor do the special features
of the day end with the last
contest. A reception is to be
given to the visiting athletes and
their supporters in the men’s
gymnasium. This will last from
the hour of seven till nine. At
the latter hour the Glee Club
will render one of its famous
promenade concerts on the steps
of Blair Hall] This will be of
more than usual interest because
of the fact that the winning athr
letcs \Vill receive their medals
in the interval between the
numbers of the concert. It is
urged by those having these af-
tairs in charge that each and
every student take it upon himr
sell to be present, andto cooper-
ate in the entertainment of the
visitors who will be among us.
The day will furnish opportuni-
ties, not only for a good time
and some excitement but also
many torsprcadingrhe name and
tame of Grinnellamong the ranks
of future college students.
