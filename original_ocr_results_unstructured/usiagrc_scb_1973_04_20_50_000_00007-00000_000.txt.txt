One point is a proposal for a “47
L4” program to allow use of the
month—long period that is now Ch-
ristmas break for academic work
The options outlined in the pros
posal, which has been submitted
to campus authorities, range from
a purely voluntary ott»campus in-
dependent study option to a pro-
gram requiring all students and
taculty to return to campus for the
month between semesters.

Willcher also proposed combining
the EPC, the Executive Council,
and the Budget Groupssa faculty
committeessinto one body that ad-
vised the President. This would
give the students on the tire, cur-
rently a subcommittee of the Exe
cutive Council, a stronger position,
Willcher believes.

The final two points in the Will-

cher program are more interdis-
ciplinary courses on the lines of
the current lZ-credit Russian stus
dies course and a new advisory
system in which majors from each
department would advise freshmen
on the strengths and weaknesses
of the curriculum and personnel
within their department.

All three candidates said they sup-
ported a credit-erase option.

On [PC Proceedings

by Scott Weil

Yesterday, the SubsCommlttee on Educational Policy of the Executive
Council (commonly referred to as the Alvaampus EPC) approved course
proposals for next year from the Economics, History, Mathematics,
Sociology and Political Science departments.

The major issue which has come before the SubsCommittee in the past
two weeks is the question of practicum credit. The Committee on Aca-
demic Standing recommended to the Suvaommittee on Educational
Policy that only 4 hours of practica credit he allowed in any one depart»
ment and a total of eight hours of practica be allowed to count towards
the 124 credit total needed for graduation. A fairly lively debate ensued
in the SubrCommlttee on the merits of practica in the curriculum of the
College.

Mf‘. Wylie Of the Music department and Mr. Moffet of the Theater departv
ment were asked to testify as to the value of practicum in their respec~
tlve department programs. The Anthropology department has practicum
credit in its curriculum and the Political Science department sent the
Sub-Committee a notice that it is seriously considering the establishment
of an intern program

The Subcommittee on Educational Policy finally offered its Own re-
commendation to the faculty; That no more than u practica credits count
towards the 124 credits required for graduation." Both proposals went
to the floor of the faculty where the questions were debated and finally
tabled because, in the opinion at one faculty member, no evidence had
been provided by either the SubACommittee on Educational Policy or
the Committee on Academic Standing as to why the reduction of practica
hours was justified,

This was a wise move on the part of the faculty, as it gives all involved
parties the opportunity to consider the arguments Underlying the move
to further restrict the number of practica hours counting towards gradu»
ation, on the part of a few faculty members, is the belief that practicum
credit has no place in our 124 credit hour academic degree.
