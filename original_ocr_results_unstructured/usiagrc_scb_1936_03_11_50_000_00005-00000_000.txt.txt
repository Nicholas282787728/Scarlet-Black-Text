places from which the Crinncll
botany department has received
collections of mosses or to which
it has sent them, Dr. H, s, Conard,
professor of botany, revealed in an
interview yesterday.

The most important collection is
the one from Amsterdam. Some‘[
of the mosses in it were collected
by Dr. Bruch, one of the authors
of “Bryologia Europaea," the first
authoritative text on that branch'
of botany, published 1836 to 1851
These ancient mosses came into
the hands of the famous botanist
Dr. Reinsch, who included them in
his large, illustrated collection, |
and were handed down to his
nephew, Dr. Hugo Gluck, professor ,
of botany at Heidelberg.

Dr. Conard and Dr. GIuck met at
the botanical conference in AmsA

collections from Grinnell and in-l
tend to return their own include
Dr, Van Der Wijk of Holland and
M. Bizot of Diion, France. ‘

North America Represented.

The North Ameiican Continent
is also represented in the GrinneII
collection, since Dr, Conard is now
cor-responding with botanists in l
