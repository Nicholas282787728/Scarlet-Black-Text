Welcome changes In Grinnell: new JudCo and bike path

A new bike path to WalMart

The completion or the biltt path to Wal-
Murt is a perfect answer to the needs of the
Grinnell community. Up until this project's
completion, ttudcnts and community cyclists
have put rhcrnselrcs and drivers at risk by
sharing the bus shoulder oinghway 146.\Vc
applaud the gr ons funding from rhe City of
Grinncll, Grinnell Tourism Group and hung
inc Grinncll, as well as the self—serving fund-
ing from VVal—Mart itself, that has fac tatctl
this expansion of bike ltcccssibili Vith this
new mode of transportation, running small
errands no longer requires rhe unneee \'
operation oi a gas rueled rehic .In add ron,
rhe path will provide another renue for our
cisc and rccrcation.

JudCo opens doors a little more

For a long time,]udicial Council (JudCo)
and the College Hearing Board have been two
of the must clandestine and con-
ﬁdeurial groups on campus '

The two disciplinary bodies

cornpris d ot students, he

ultv and staff, were formed "

by a largely subjective selec-

tion A Skull and Bones, if

you will where students are in-

ducted to the board in secret. l-iowevcr,]udCo
isn’t just a drinking group. It often decided
siudcnts'futures at this school.

The new changes brought to the two
groups are much needed upgrades to what was
an undemocratic insrirution. JudCo members,

rather than bcing hand-picked by adminiss

trators, will be elected by the strident body.

This will allow a new degree of accountabib

ity, and help Shoot the powers of

- those who are paid to run the

school on a daily basis. And,

thankfully, these changes

were largely encouraged and

embraced by Dean of Sin»

dents Travis Greene and Di—

rector ofStudcnt Affairs Houston

Douglrar-ryTbis shows a certain rrusr with the
student body that is always a good sign.

The dissemination ofrcporr rid stdtistics
regarding ~lrrdCo and College Heating Boaid
wrll also help tree the groups from what eoald
lead to an tbrrse of judicial power. Keeping

a living record or how disciplinary issues are
dealt with and resolved, will help ensure that
institutional memory keeps the boards an-
chorerl in safe waters.

JudCo and College Hearing Board will al-
ways maintain a certain level orseerecy—and
rightfully so. When dealing wirh students and
disciplinary issues, identities must be withheld
and sr nations guarded to a degree. Otherwise,
the forces ofour small campus would often ins
rerr the maxim “Innocent until prevail guilty"
and the identities of victims would not be safe.
But the new changes, which will hold marry
oftliose accountable whojutlge as well as cre-
ate a concrete history upon which disciplinary
decisions can be made, are a step in that right
direction towards fairucsst

Becoming native to this place: digging into the culture of Grinnell

This year rlre collcgc is celebrating its 150 year in the town
of Giinticll. Although the town and college have become so
intertwined over that ccnturv and a half, it is sii 11 possible to
think that Grinncll sits apart from the town or aparr rrorn rhe
part of iowa that ir ocerrpres. Over my rune at Grinnell Coir
lege,l have noticed the sentiment among some that the town of
Grinnell is more or less extraneous to the college. Grinnell Coir
lcgcjust happens to be in Gtinnell, in Iowa, but its not really of
Grinnell, or oflowutThat's one meaning orrhe old expression
“the Gl'lnncll bubble."

It is not just that the Grinncll environment is insulated
against the “real world" (I‘ve always
thought this was a srrrprrsingly ulr
critical dichotomy for critically thinks
mg Grinnell students to maintain), it
also means we can be insulated {win
our immediate location—the town,
the land around us, the local culture
and peoplei think knowing rhis plaee bcvond the 120 acres of
campus and beyond rlre 1500 students here is as irnporranr as
thc education we rccciic or the relationships we make here.

In many parts of the Country, including Connecticut, where
I grew up, Iowa rs a symbol for the quotidian and the hornogs

" BECOMING NATIVE
‘ TO THIS PLACE

cnous, for boredom and ﬂatness.Thc character oflowa and its
importance and eonneerron with rlre rcst otrhe country and the
world are lost when viewed from that distorted distance} think
studcnts who conic to Griniicll invariably learn that Iowa is
more than the stereoty pe ofcndless com fields and "hick' fillm'
at: What I hope, though, is that beyond breaking this stereo-
type, we can begin to form an appreciation and intimacy with
this place—that' in certain way we can become nitivcs to this
place rather than just ers through.
Most ofus arc pass' g through, thoughMost orus are here
for four years, less ifyoi akc away rlre long summer and winter
breaks, But the process of beeorrrrng
native doesn’t Ilcccssmlly have to ex-
clnde us. While many of us will leave
after graduating, learning about and
engaging in tlrrs plaee, whcrher we
decide to leave or not, can teach us to
he a part otnny plaec. i remember rcllr
ing my iut0iial class thicc ycrus ago how I felt like a tree that
irrsr begun to put down roors only to be uprooted anti hastily
transplanted to Iowa I remember the sense of rawncss and disr
location I had over leaving a place 1 had come to love, a small
town in rural northwestern Connecticut. and moving halfway

across (lie. country to a bigger smull town in the Midwest. The
process offinding a home agarn in Grinneil and learning about
a wlroie new place has taught me rhe meaningrulness and ne-
eessrry ofthat process fol our own well-being in oddirion ro rho
wellsberng ofcammunities.

“Beeomrng natire to rhis plaee" are not my wordsrhey are
the title of a book by Wes Jackson, the founder of the Land
Institute III Kansas and a chcknown activist for a new feim
ofsusrainablc agriculturelackson writes that his book is meant
to bc “a challenge to the universities to stop and think about
what they are dorng wrrh young men and women." He writes
that rrnivcrsitres “offer only one serious major: upward mobility.
Little attention is paid to educating the young to return home,
oi ro go some orher place, and dig in. There is no such rlring as a
'homeeornrng'mayoru think crinneu College,rvirlr the Center
for Prairie Studies and other ciforts, has shown that there is a
group oi‘people here who are not ignorant ofplncc and its im-
porranee, and while rhere rna be no “homecoming" major, we
are offered a lot of opportuni es to “dig” into this community
and its sllnoundlngs. I hope with this column to provide SolnC
ofthose opportunities, to write about issues relevant to Grinnell
and Iowa rn a way that will help make us more aw.u't: of this
place and am part in it.
