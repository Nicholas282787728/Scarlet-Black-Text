semester.

Matt Wagner ‘97, who per—
formed in She Stoops to Conquer in
March, is directing the troupe again
this semester, They will perform
twice in Grinnell's elementary
schools and take their act to nearby
Tama for FrogFest to perform With
other groups.

Most of the College students
who come toil perform With Green

performinginthe theatre, However,
the troupe presents or relatively safe

it is a eooperotive ertort, rather than
a competitive one. like performanc-

Since the shows are directed at
elementary school students, the lan-

simplified. Moreover. the perfor-

imaginations. “Kids are the best au—
