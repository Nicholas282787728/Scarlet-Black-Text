The Misfits

oy Bruce Emond

For star watchers and film devotees
alike, “The Misfits" is an excellent, albeit
Somewhat troubling diversion. Filmed in
blackrandrwhite, “The Misfits” is a poig-
nant, bleak examination of the lives at
several lonely individuals, each searching
to create their own niche in an impersonal,
cold world Not least among the films at
'tractions are the direction of John Huston
and Arthur Miller's screenplay,

A story of a group ol‘ cowboys roaming
the Nevada desert and rounding up wild
horses ior use in dog food does not sound
like an exciting premise for a movie.
However, “The Misfits” delves deeper into
the reasons each character has elected to
adopt the liiestyle oi a bygone era, thus
alienating himselt irom the surrounding
society, The cowboys are joined by a
naive, bewildered divorcee. played by
Marilyn Monroe, who is torn between her
involvement with them and her moral obs
jections to the killing of the horses.

The film's cast 15 impressive with Clark
Gable and Monroe giving excellent perfor-
mances. The good times for these actors
were sliding away (this was Gable’s last
iilm and both Montgomery ctiit and
Monroe died of drug overdoses within {our
years oi its completion), and a special
vulnerability pervades the periormances.
Monroe’s bloated, lined iace, and brittle,
overly bleached hair is a shocking, almost
bizarre caricature of the beautiful actress
of “The P 'nce and the Showgirl,” “Bus
Stop,” and entlemen Prefer Blondes."
In "The Misfits,” however, Monroe sheds
the artiliciality and baby~doll passivity of

her earlier screen persona, and her perl’orr
mance is disarmingly charming and
sincere. Gable, a victim like Cary Grant of
never receiving recognition of his talents
because his acting "looked too easy,“ is
especially good in the character role oi the
old, world-weary cowboy. Cliit's perlor-
mance, (he was seen on campus earlier
this Semester in “Suddenly Last
Summer"), is strangely distant, his
sheeplsh grin and slow mannerisms giving
him the appearance oi an aged James
Dean “The Misfits" is a line,
generally underrated film which will leave
you feeling unsettled and depressed but

Last TaIi

by Brian Strause

It you want to see a woman so entranced
by the sexual prowess of Marlon Brando
that she agrees to eat vomit as proof oi her
love. go see “Last Tango in Paris," a iilm
so sizzling that people in 1973 were lining
up ior the privilege or shelling out 55 to see
this extravaganza in a stickyseated
theatre in Manhattan. Perhaps by today‘s
standards “Last Tango" seems a little
watered-down and certainly not worthy oi
its "X" rating; but then again.,we’re talks
ing Marlon Brando in the act at mad,
screaming sex The sex is so intense the
screen almost drips oi lubricant, yet
through all this, there is not even one shot
ol Brando's genitals.

Brando plays Paul, a 45-year»old loser
whose wife just slashed her throat in the
bathtub. Realizing his present liie needs to
be put on hold, Paul decides to turn over a
new leal 7 and what better way to start
than to move out of the scene of his wife’s
suicide and settle into a cozy new apart
merit?

he encounters Jeanne (Marla Schneidert,
