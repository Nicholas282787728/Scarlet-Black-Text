Mirecourt Trio
to visit China

by Ted Knitter

Grinnell College Mirecourt Trio will
begin a 19—day tour of China On October 12
The group will spend several days in Pek-
ing, Xian, fin the middle of China) and
Shanghar

Grinnell music instructors and trio
members Kenneth Goldsmith, John
Jensen, and Terry King will play with
Chinese symphonies, instruct masters
classics and perform solo appearances
during their China tour,

The trio applied through the Center for
United States/China Cultural Arts EXr
change after being encouraged by a
composerrfriend, Paul Reale, who had
been to China before. Their application
was presented to the Chinese government
and accepted,

Trio violinist Kenneth Goldsmith said
the trio will play mainstream American
music, mostly classical, jazz, and some
works written by composerrfriend Paul
Reale. The group will also perform the
Mirecourt Trio repetoire which includes
yworks by Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendel

"Most ol the American music that the
Chinese have heard from groups like us
are the pieces involving a lot of disonance,
which they have iound uninteresting This
will be sort of new for them,” said
Goldsmith.

Trio pianist John Jensen said that the
Chinese play some different instruments
than Western symphonies and it will be in-
teresting to hear how the music Will sound

The group isn't getting a free trip
though. “The Mirecourt Trio is a corpora-
tion,” said Goldsmith, “and Richard

Jenkins, the Chairman of the Board, has
been our main fundraiser."

 

The Mivecourt Trio

Richard Jenkins of Grinnell College
Estate Planning department helped with
most of the expenses. Goldmith added that
the government doesn’t pay for exchanges
like this, and the trip is linanced largely
through private individuals and the
members’ own pockets.

The appearances will probably be broad
cast and televised, but no intention of a
record is being planned said Goldsmith.
He was not sure it a Chinese group will
come to the United States

Jensen is excited about the trip because
China has seemed like a mystery to him

"There has only been social intercourse
between our country and China for about
10 or ll years which began with Nixon's
trip in 1972," said Jensen, “l've been doing
some research and reading so i can deal
with a totally new culture,” he added,

Kenneth Goldsmith said, “The Chinese
are culturally sophisticated and their
classical music is really beautiful They
are very receptive to Western culture.
Both sides are very excited about the ex-
change," he added.

SGA debates concert budget

by M. Woitgang Schumann

Discussion at the Joint Board meeting
Wednesday night centered on the
operating budget of the concert fund and
on coordinator Fred Klatz’s spending of
almost twice his normal'allotment on one
band performance, The revised budget
was debated. Dave Kopelman’s resolution
concerning the Soviet Union's recent
downing of a South Korean passenger jet
was turned down,

Fred Klatz then outlined his financial
situation on the chalkboard in the front of
the SGA meeting room. Chalk ﬂew and
numbers were written and erased at
lightning speed, but when all the dust settlr
ed down, one number was outlined boldly
and boxed around many times: 1200. Klatz
said he needed that much more money to
keep ”good” concerts booked each
weekend, because of a large expenditure
for this year's James Hall Bacchannal.

“I don‘t know what to tell you,” replied
Sckalor, “We didn’t know where else to cut
from. If you do go over budget you're
liable,” he continued in an oblique

reference to Klatz's alleged spending,

habits. Bethe Keegan, Social Coordinator,
countered, “Fred did not go over budget
last year,"

“That’s kind of a lie,” chuckled Sckalor.

Then Mike Oxman, an off-campus non-
collegerowned representative, suggested
dropping SP&R lunds entirely to make up
the difference. “If we stopped funding
things [5&8, KDIC, the Cyclone, and the
Grinnell Review], the collegeyustwouidn't
let it drop " That idea was quickly killed
after Sckalor mentioned that such cuts
would only cause the college to reduce the
Student Activities fee to make room for a
student publications fee, and that the in
terest on that money would be lost to SGA
a 50.

Next came debate on Dave Kopelman's
proposed resolution condemning the Soviet
Union‘s destruction Of KAL Flight #007
Kopelman told or an informal meeting
with Cowles President Charles Blomqulst
and SGA President Jon Sharff, at which
the resolution idea was brought up it was
decided that Kopelman would write up a
resolution and introduce it at last week’s
Joint Board meeting.

“I think the basic point of it is this 7 i
don’t want to sound patriotic or anything,"
said Kopelman, “but as members of free
society we should be outraged. . . Il
everybody had that kind of attitude [not to
get involved] we’d have a pitifully sad
government.”

students who happen to qualify for federal
funds.”

College Chaplain Dennis Haas also
pOmtS out that this only affects those
young men who chose to go to college, Only
about 40 percent of all high school
graduates chose to do so,

Associate Director of Admissions and
Student Financial Aid Richard Vos said,
“The effect (the law) is cerminly biased.
The problem is that Congress is so
lrustrated by the iact that so many people
haven‘t registered Now they’re grasping
at straws and, 1 think, rather futilely.”

So far, over 700,000 eligible young men
have not registered despite failure to come
ply can result in prosecution with a maxr
imum sentence of tive years, and a tine of
$10,000 The number of nonrregistrants has
increased by about 200,000 from 1900, when
former President Carter signed draft
registration into law.

“The college is no longer put in a police
function, but now acts as a middle man,
though the college still feels awkward and
abused," said Grinnell College President
George Drake

The Grinnell College Board of Trustees
registered their objections to the Solomon
amendment in a statement released last
February. The Board also stated that it
has authorized Drake “to take steps to
register objections up to and possibly in
eluding appropriate legal action "

President Drake said that the college IS
waiting for the Suprelne Court to make a
final ruling on the questions of unconstitur
tionality and discrimination raised on the
Solomon amendment.

Because the amendment is politically
popular in the legislature, President
Drake believes whatever pressure is to be
applied should be done through the courts.

According to Selective Service officials,
the main problem is youthful 'sloth’ and
'procrastination’ But according to Nation
Magazine there is active noncompliance
by minority groups such as poor blacks
who feel alienated from socrety and See
registration as exploitation by “the
system.” Also many college students
reruse to comply because they teel -there
is an implicit linkage between registra-
tion, the dralt, and U 5, military adven-
turism around the world.

College administration officials resent
that colleges have been given the
task by the government to enlorce the law.
The Amendment orginally required cola
leges to prove a student had registered
Currently only a signed affidavit testifying
that a student is registered is required
before the school can issue financial and
This was accomplished said Hopkins, “by
the howl put up by the linancial aid coma
munity” over how much more paperwork
this would involve

Congress is currently considering a pro
posal to Cut federal funding to colleges lhat
replace governmental aid with their own
institutional aid.

It the proposal becomes law, Drake said
that Grinnell will not divert college funds
to cover lost iederal money

so far two colleges have decided to go
ahead and replace the government aid lost
by their students who have refused to
register. Goshen College, a Menonlte in-
stitution, is doing so with the {manual
backing of local Menonlte churches
Earlham, a Quaker college, is also doing
so, though non—registrants must go before
a college board and show that their beliefs
are ‘deeply rooted'

However, although these colleges have
enough linancial resources for their pre-
sent action, it remains to be seen what will
be done it they start losing federalfunding,

In the face of the policies of the college
and the government, some Grinnell Cola
lege students have decided to register.
Others are financially well enough off to
cover the lost aid themselves, and continue
to refuse to register.

One student, who requested anonymity,
told The Scarlet aiid Black he is neither
willing to register, nor able to finance the
forfeited government aid, at least "“7
mediately. He says that the college has
given him until the end of the semester to
make up the difference.

An anonymous student said he thinks he
can iinancially manage to remain at Grinr
nell until the end of the school year After
that he doesn’t know what the will do

Also this week a student received his
final notice from the Selective Service
stating that it he failed to register within
the next ten days, his name would be torn-
ed over to the Justice Department for pro
Secution. Despite this, the student said he
will continue to refuse to comply, His res
asons stem from not wanting to go to war
to promote the interests ot the govern
ment. “We have the right to fight them
[communist countries] through economic
means. We should persuade, not force
[them to turn to democracy],” said the
anonymous student.

The student said that he has considered
registering and filing as a conscientious
objector, but decided against it

“If you file for a C 0., then you’re saying
that you need someone to tell you your
morals are right," said the student.

The student does not think the college
should replace his lost aid. He does teel,
however, that the college should take more
or a stand on the issue. “The college has
more power than an individual," he said.

Another student, who also asked that his
name be withheld, has also refused to
register despite losing some aid The
amount lost was small enough, though,
that the student was able to cover it on his
own

The student said that he is going to start
preparing to file as a conscientious objec-
tor He is still undecided, however,
whether he will file Since he does not want
to support the military in any tashion
Also, he sees fighting the law in a legal
manner as ‘hypocrltical’, “Your ireedom
of expresswn is taken away from you
because you express yourself."

Junior Mike (dxman decided to register
rather than sacrificmg his aid Oxman had
received his fourth letter of warning from
the Selective Service recently.

"I ieel like a hypocrite to sell my morals
tor money,” said Oxman. Oxman said he
also registered because he has plans to file
for Co. status and does not want to
"screWrup" his application. Oxman com-
mented that ”it just seems that refusing to
register and losing linancial aid for college
don't go hand in hand together,"

Oxman said that he received his iirst
warning from the Selective Service quite
soon after his eighteenth birthday. He
claimed that because of his activism in
high school, he feels that he has been Singlr
ed out for special attention by the Selective
Sevice

Grinnell College Chaplain Dennis Haas
agreed saying, “The selectiveness of the
court cases it very obvious and the persons
who have been picked out have been the
most outspoken."

Only two noncregistrants who have been
prosecuted in lowa, Gary Eklund and RuSr
ty Martin, have both been declaring
publicly their reiusal to comply since
registration became law Eklund also has
a long history as a war protestor. Martin
was the SGA president last year at the
university ol lowa

So tar, the Selective Service has only
shown evidence of taking action against
evaders after having received a com-
plaint,

Less than thirty non-registrants have ac-
tually been prosecuted. By comparison
during the Vietnam War, among 570,000
nonrl'eglstrants only 0,750 were ever conr
victed

Students who are against registering do
have some options. Richard Vos urges
students to write letters to Congress. Den-
nis l-laas suggests that individually,
students can start preparing a conscien-
tious objector statement “50 that when and
ii' a draft law is enacted, they will at least
have some history to say 'I thought about
this betore the law was passed ' "

l-laas has organized a group on campus
concerned with draft registration. The
'Registi-ation/Dratt/co Information
Group' has set as its goal to work to intorin
people about the issues and not to be an ac-
tivist organization, according to Haas.
Along these lines, Haas said, the group is
planning to stair an information table in
the post office during the beginning of next
month, and organize an open tor-um on Oc-
tober 10
