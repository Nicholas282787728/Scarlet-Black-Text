The classes are held from 10:30 to

an average of 15-18 children show up
for each class, By sending pcnnrssion

Wirtzfeld and Colin have found the
chance to work With kids who are
eager about art. The opportunity to
develop this eagerness into a lifetime
of an awareness drives the teachers to
conduct the program.

New Mystery Object

So nowwe move on to another Mys-

effective in its own way,

It was submitted by Melvin Price of

late 19205 and early 19305. It's long,
about two feet long, and made ofiron,
and has quite a heﬁ to it. [t‘s not avails

took it home with him as he expects to
contribute ittothc museum in Marengo.

But with luck some folk will rec-

This March, two Alt Break crews

munities across the country beneﬁted
from their work. And participants
wouldn’t trade the Alter-native Break
for one more common.

“The Alt Break program is inspir-
ingiitgoesbeyondconventionalcom-
munity service," said Jeana le, ‘00, a
student participant in one of the San
Francisco programs. Her break con-
sisted of participating in an environs
mentally-focused group that worked
in food banks and organic gardens in
the Bayarea.

Jeri Larimer, ‘99, who ledagroup of
students working on a Native Ameri-
can reservation in North Dakota, found
her experience offered her both educa-
tion and insight. “My trip was very
calm," shesaid. ounngtheirstay, group
members participated in a pow wow
and pipe ceremony.

She said that the people there were
excited to host the volunteers and in-
vited the students to learn more about
Native American culture. As a repre-
sentative of the Grinnell community,
Larimer feels that the group of stu-
dents leﬁ a similarly positive impres-
sion on members of the host commu-
nity.

Megan Hustings, ‘01, expressed a
great deal of satisfaction with her ex-
perience in San Francisco. Her group
worked with an AIDS outreach pro-
gram, soupkitchens and other commu-
nity activities. She said that the feel-
ings from befriending members ofthe
San FranSisco community are invalua
able to her, and that she knew her work
was worthwhile by the smiles the group
helped bring to the faces ofthose they
met.
