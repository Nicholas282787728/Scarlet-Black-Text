Grinnell students pride themselves on their dis
versity and progressive liberal views. They consider
themselves intellectually engaged and intelligent and
work to promote awareness and acceptanceThis im-
age is one that quite often appears to reject pop culr
ture, technology, Hollywood and television. It is true
thatTV is shunned by some students,hut others em-
brace it with open arms, making it a scheduled part
of their lives.

Although students don’t have cable access or sate
ellite feed in their dorm rooms, groups of students
gather in lounges all over campus on different nights
of the week to watch speciﬁc shows together.

Some ofthese groups are oahcial clubs with mails
ing Lists. Others are unoﬁ‘icial gatherings of friends
or strangers that have grown to the
point where lounges are reserved
indeﬁnitely for speciﬁc weekly
shows.

In other lounges, you can ﬁnd
students warchingTv rcgularly, no
matter what's on. “There are usua
ally people in Younker [Lounge]
hanging out watching TV from
four until quite late," said Peter
Campbell ‘06, the hall social coordinator for Smonks
er. “It‘s not an organized group, but it tends to rou—
tincly be rhe same people.“

Organizers for most of the unofficial groups
mentioned that the only “organization" involved was
reserving the lounges. “There were never any signs
put up to advertise where ‘Gilmorc Girls’ was being
watched, but people found out by word of mouth."
said Mary Pat Twomey ‘08, a member ofa group that
watches the show weekly in Read Lounge.

some groups look at television more academically,
discussing and critically analyzing TV shows in ad
dition to reading related essays. For example, Mary
Parker ‘06 began an ExCo class about The X—Fx/ri duts
ing her first year. The class continues to meet Wednes-
day and Sunday nights in Haincs Lounge at 9 pm,
watching DVD episodes oftlic popular ‘905 scieﬁ show
and discussing themes and social aspects within it.

The five to 12 members even study the mythology

’ihe X—Files was a pretty seminal
Show of the 79905 [and] an excels
lent reflection of some aspects of
American culture.”

Students add a social twist to tele-
vision by watching in dorm lounges
and starting TV~themed clubs

arc, which Parker described as “the continuing plot
thread involving alien colonization of earth and the
government conspiracy to promote this.”

Parker decided to offer the class “because Tb: Xe
Filatwas a pretty seminal show otthe 1990s [and] an
excellent reﬂection of some aspects of American cult
ture," she said. “And there’s plenty of critical material
out there on the social issues that it brings up."

Although groups like the The XeFl/ea class are stiLl
growing, others have shrunk over time. According to
Christine Vigeland ‘06, the group that watches The
West Wing in Haines Lounge used to be fairly large,
but most of the people have graduated. Although the
unofﬁcial group still reserves the lounge, only three
people now watch the show on a regular basis._

Family Guy is also very popular on campus, spur-
ring the creation of the oﬁicial
Grinnell Family Guy Club. Ac
cording to Sean Tamulonis ‘08, a
member and organizer, the group
is planning to resume meetings
once the new season or Family
Guy begins this spring.

jeopardy is watched by a large
crowd in Cleveland Lounge most
weekdays. and Read Lounge is rce
served on Thursdays for 77]: 0.0

Some other popular shows that students watch
regularly, especially on DVD, include Ti}: Simpmm,
Flinn/mm and Fn'wdr. Many of these shows are also
hosted by students on Phynd (pi;yiid,mnbaniii,net),
which allows students to download and watch full
seasons or even full runs of current shows and shows
that are no longer on the air.

Although more “intellectual" shows such as jeop-
mdy, T/ze XrFi/er, T/Je Wm Wing and WM Daily S/Mlu
are popular on campus as might be expected, campus
groups also watch The 0, a, Dispel n1: I'lom‘cwiwx and
other similar shows intended primarily to entertain.

Many of the lounges on campus are graced lit ltl.l
hours or the day by the familiar blue glow otrhe TV
screen. sometimes there Is a lone watcher making
his or her own programming decisions, sometimes a
small group channel surﬁng for that pertecr show, and
other times weekly groups, unified in interest.
