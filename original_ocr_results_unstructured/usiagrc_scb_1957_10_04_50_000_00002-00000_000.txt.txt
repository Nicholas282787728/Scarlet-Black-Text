r Homecoming Culture

“American Culture at Mid—Century” is likely to be the
year’s outstanding academic event in the Midwest.

It is fitting that the Convocation should combine Home-.

coming and Parents’ Day because its distinctive quality will
make us proud to welcome among our guests our parents

and alumni. However, the weekend will be distinctive only'

because it has high qualityns‘ an academic convocation
which will draw outstanding speakers and audiences. We

must keep this in mind when deciding what other events,

will be involved.

The plans make it very clear that the Administration
is seeking complete support from the student body The foot-
ball game was one of the first events scheduled. When stu-
dents complained about the'lack of’e dance, it was added.
A pep rally has been squeezed in for Friday night. And,
students are now deciding whether Homecoming decorations
will be erected by the halls. ‘

‘Actually, all these student activities are peripheral to
the academic character of the Convocation. It is expected
that they will be enjoyable to our guests and form part
of the impression left by the weekend. But what kind of
an impression will Grinnell College leave its guests if these
peripheral events appear ,to be the only interests of the
student body?

Instead of displaying time-consuming heaps of con-
structive genius in front of the halls, Why not assign to
each group a part of the platform on which the queen
and her court will view the game, or, part of the specta—
tors’ slde of the playing field — to be decorated as elab-
orately as the hall wishes, ybut in accordance with an over-
all themel The usual Grinnell variety of Homecoming dec—
orations. would cheapeh the campus immeasurably and'we
have neither time not money to do a university—type job.

, Also, why not announce the Homecoming queen at half-
time ceremonies, rather than trying to excite into a frenzy
of school spirit a crowd which has just heard Todd Dun-
(éan and Theresa Gl'eenesinging excerpts from "Porgy and

' ess". ,

Grinnell College has given us the opportunity to listen
to great men of our times, to learn about them beforehand,
and to discuss them with competent scholars for as long
afterward as we wish. It is the chance of a lifetime, In the
same weekend we Will enjoy most of the events we look
forward to at Homecoming and Parents’ Day. During this
Convocation We Will be a major part of the impression which
Grinnell leaves on the guests who mayimean a lot to its
colleges future. If we, the present products of Grinnell,
cannot.keep a true perspective on importance of the dif-

ferent events, then the Convocation cannot be a success.

To the Editor: \

A quick reading of last week’s'
“Sackcloth and Ashes” seems to
reveal a defen'se of freshman
rights and individuality, but a
closer examination illuminates
in several respects a plea for
mediocrity and “professional
non-conformity."

i
- It is well taken that citizens
in a free society have certain

'rights which must be respected.
What is neglected are the re.-
sultant “duties” which taken to-
gether add up to ”good” citizens

‘,sh , hnd which are required
to maintain free society at all.

I think that ‘Grinnell college
is not dedicated to the creation
of “misanthropes, or bad or in«
different people” generally, and
it would be very enlightening
to have Thompson provide us

with a single example of man’s

instltdtions that is so dcdicated.‘

tend'

Further, within .the deﬁnition
of a misanthrope as a “hater of
mankind,” I think that no man
qualiﬁies as ”great." GoAit-
alonei‘s and social rebels, on the
other hand,’ often make Very
positive Contributions to society,
and within the present prepping
program there is more than
ample room for these.

While it may be a lie that
one must JOIN to be successful,
it is not a lie that one OUGHT
to join to become a more well—
rcundcd, understanding, and
“bigger" person. The present
program may fall short of its
announced goals, but it is bet-
ter to shoot for those goals
realizing this, than to misunder-
stand the value of them in the
contemporary world.

'To the Editor:

1 agree with Dean King’s let-
ter of Sept. 27 only in part. The
flowering crab tree was a thing
of beauty. i join him in mourn-
ing its loss, thrcin do I then
differ from him? I disagree
thnt the fault is exclusively to
be laid at the door of prepping.
1 disagree also that a “one-man
campaign" can be effective. For
tile, problem is mot one crab
tree looking as though nobody
loved it. Last spring vacation
faculty members yisited cam-
puses in California and in Penn-
sylvznia. To them our whole
campus looked as though‘no-
body loved it. -

Please don’t think that i am
saying that one man can do
nothing. That would be false
in fact. For many of the trees
on our campus were set out
by a former president, who
according to legend took a
spade to make place for the
gifts of a nurseryman. And
many of us believe when we
pass the chestnut tree east of
Goodnow that Professorucni-y
onnird imported the seed
from the uni-hast, and some
know that blight—resistant
chestnut RS the Canard chest-
nut. indccd it would bc absurd
to think that society could get
us a lovely campus without
any individual person doing
anything. ,

,Nor am I denying that prep-
ping was destructive to that
ﬂowering crab. i want to no

prepmasters, but don't neglect to
add that the students, the

to do much co-operatively to
make our campus—beautiful.

To the Editor:

Can Grinnell really claim, as
Dr. Bowen stated in chapel on
September 25, that our “ideal
has been to give young people
the, equipment, and the will, to
help make ,this a better world"?

Immost things i know\ here,
I believe it is. But do we not
realize that a part of this goal .
rests in the Grinnell graduates
ability to communicate that
which he has been’well trained
to think, to encourage others to
think intelligently and with un-
derstanding’! Should he not use
what we study ébout interna-
tional, domestic and personal ai-
fairs to make this a better
world?” ‘

Mess communication today is
the victim of prejudice, scnsa:
tionalism and ignorance. if
Grinnell hopes to improve this
world, is there a more necessary
place for Grinnellians than in
the ﬁelds of mass communica-
tion—television, radio, newspa-
pers, etc.

We recognize the usefulness
of our newspaper and we use
it to train journalists, but we
have ﬁne, intelligent young men

’seeking to carry their abilities

into radio, men who spend-their
own time to study and build a
system, and we refuse to sub-
sidize, or even to loan money
for equipment at KGRW. The
administration and students both
have shown a lack of coopera-
tiveness with the men who are
trying to make our station oper-
ate well.
