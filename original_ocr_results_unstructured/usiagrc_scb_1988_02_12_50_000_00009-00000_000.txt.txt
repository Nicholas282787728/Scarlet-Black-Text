What is the greatest contribution
that Ronald Reagan has made to
this country? Without question it is
turning down the role of Richard
Blane (Rick) in “Casablanca,"

”Casablanca” was released in
January, 1943, and the influences
oi World War II are very evident in
the plot and the numerous subs
plots. Humphrey Bogart plays
Richard Blane, an American who
was forced to leave the United
States to go to France for a
mysterious reason, He rlees the
Nazi occupation to go to Casablan»
ca because he knows he is on the
Nazi “Roll of Honor." Casablanca
is an international relugee camp oi
thousands oi Europeans ileeing
Hitler's advances and trying to get
to America, With the exception of a
few, everyone is waiting for a
precious exit-visa which will let
them escape to Lisbon, then to the
United States,

Bogart is at his best, The role or
Rick lets him play the kind or
character that he does better than
anyone else. the seemingly cold
hearted rogue who cares ior no one
and wanm no one to care for him.

“I stick my neck out ior nobody,”
he says as he watches the Vichy
French policemen drag a suspect
from his cafe.

This man. Senior ugate, played
by Peter Lorre, had stolen two
“letters of transit" that would
allow any two people to escape
Casablanca unhindered by the
Vichy authorities, This serves as
the basis [or the movie's plot and
subplots. Victor Laslow, a
Czechoslovakian resistance
leader, played by Paul Henreid,
and his wire Ilsa Lund, played by
lngrid Bergman. walk into “Rick’s
Cale Americain." The reaction of
Sam, Rick's piano player. to the
sight oi the couple instantly
previews the trouble that is to
come. llsa is an old ﬂame oi Rick
from their Paris days,

Victor Laslow knowsrol’ the let
ters oi transit and WanB Rick to
sell them to him 50 he and his wife
can escape and continue their
resistance work. Rick, forever bit-
ter over they way llsa abandoned
him in Paris, does not want to give
Laslow the letters. Ilsa, who is not
sure if she still loves Rick, must
choose between the two men.

The ending is nothing less than
spectacular. It allows the seeming-
1y coldshearted Rick DJ Show a little
emotion, but he nevertheless res

Scarlet and Black

mains the rogue.

The main iaulm of“Casablanca"
are iaults oi attitudes oi the 19405.
The only black man in the iilm is
Sam, Rick’s piano player. He is
practically a servant whose last

name is never given. llsa even -

reiers to Sam as “the boy over
there." One can easily see the
19405 attitude towards women as
well. At one point, llsa tells Rick,
“You have to think for both or us."
She has a very important decision
to make. and instead oi making it
hersell, she tollows the whims oi
the two main male characters or
the iilm,

Another example or an early
19405 attitude is the World War It
mentality oi the iilm. One cannot
escape the almost blatant anti
German/pro-I-‘ree French ieeling
oi the ﬁlm, The audience is shown
how much even the French col»
laborators hate the Germans. The
most obvious example is the sing~
ing or the Marseillaise, the French
national anthem. The Germans in
Rick’s caié start to sing a na-
tionalistic German song, Anenrag-
ed Laslow leads Rick‘s band and
the rest oi the antirGerman crowd
in a rousing version oi the
Marseillaise, until they drown out
the Germans.
