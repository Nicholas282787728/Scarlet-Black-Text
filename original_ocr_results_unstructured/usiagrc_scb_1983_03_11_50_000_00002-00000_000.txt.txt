Measles Alert

Indiana University and Purdue
University are reporting a massive out»
break of the measles, The possibility of
the transmission of measles between
colleges and universities is great. par-
ticularly with spring break p
preaching, students should be notified
that if they have not had the disease or
if their immunization was prior to 1968,
they are at risk oi contacting measles
While immunization may be ac-
complished with the single virus
measles vaccine, we recommend using
the combination vaccine for measles,
mumps and rubella (MMP), So if you
are unsure of the date of your last imr
munization or if you will be in close con-
tact with someone from one of the
stricken institutions, beware of the
telltale signs of measles.

Assault warning stirs campus

by Catherine Ingrassin

A warning to women about the possibili-
ty of sexual assuit was issued by the Office
of Student Affairs on March 8 in an all-
campus mailing.

Last weekend, a non-college person
overheard a coversation among some
unidentified town men about sexually
assulting female runners.

The person was “so alarmed by the
nature and tone of the conversation,” said
Jim Tederman, dean of student affairs,
“U’iat he felt we should be notified." The
person also informed the Grinnell police of
the incident and then told Tederman late
Monday. The school issued its warning late
Tuesday.

Tcderman ielt it was impormni to in
form the college community of this
development.

Tederrnan stated that “the police do in
tend to take precautionary measures and
plan to begin an investigation.” For ob-
vious security reasons, Tederman declin-
ed to elaborate on the measures the police
plan to take.

The person who overheard the conversar
tion'was unable to identity the persons
speaking, but gave a description of them to
the police.

Incidences of sexual assult in past years
have taken place primarily on campus.

 

The rape oi a college woman last year Dce
curred in the isolated Penruse area.

“Women should be particularly Cautious
off campus," urged Tederamn, although
caution at all times is advised.

“it’s just unfortunate that you have to
take ﬂiese kinds of precautions in a small
town like this,” added Tederman.

Many students echoed Tederman’s sens
timents. “I was scared shitless" said one
male senior.

Other students labelled the memo “fear-
mongering.” “I hope it was a creditable
admonition, because they certainly got
people stirred up about it," said one up-
perclassman.

“It made me sick, I think it’s really
disgusting. But then any woman should
have common sense enough not to do this
(run in isolated areas), especially after
last year,” said one woman.

“i never expected to get something like
this in Grinnell," one freshman woman
commented,

“in a seemingly isolated world like Grins
nell," added a senior woman, “it is very
sobering to receive such an announcer
merit. On the other hand, if it is going to
make students behave more cautiously,
then its purpose was serve."

Proposal would I disband JB,

meant to create activity

by Jeff Raymond

A proposal to eliminate .lomt Board was
brought beiore the last JB meeting by Vic
Rudolph. Rudolph, past president of Read
Hall, believes that with the lack of effec
tiveness of .18, the student government
would be better served by a president, vice
president and a small cabinet.

Rudolph explained that he put forth the
proposal, not to actually get rid of JB, but

to increase ‘action in the present system.‘

“Joint Board is ineffective,” he said.
“Supposedly, we have representative
government, but the fact of the matter is
most representatives don't get enough stu
dent input." He continued mat as a result
oi the lack of input, “No one ever discusses
issues at JB.”

John Moffett, SGA president, agreed
with Rudolph’s assertion. “There hasn't
been as much discussion as last
semester," said Moffett He explained that
the lack of discussion was due mostly to
the different composition of .18, which in-
cludes more freshmen and other inex-
pen'enced representatives.

“It might have gone over better if he had
come to JR directly," commented Moifett.
The proposal was not brought up for a vote
alter a fifteen minute debate at the .13
meeting.

The system proposed by Rudolph would
create cabinet meetings open to the stu-
dent body as it is now, but only five or six
elected officials would be responsible to
meet every week to raise and discuss
issues. “The responsibility orrepresenta-
tion would be on me students themselves,"
Rudolph said.

When asked whether the lack of
representatives under his plan might fur-
ther decrease participation in student
government, Rudolph replied, “It’s cer—
lainly no worse than what we have now."
He brought up the recently adopted
“babysitting" bylaw, which allows
representatives only three absences from
the weekly JB meetings, as an example of
an attempt to increase involvement in the
present system. He asserted that the
bylaw does not solve the problem of lack of
interest in .18 by its own members.

In addition to being Read Hall president
last semester, Rudolph was an organizer
of the controversial and wellrattended stu-
dent forum on administrative authoritar-
ianism, which focused primarily on the
hotly-contested decision to deny tenure to
Assistant Professor oi Philosophy Dan
Magurshak.

Rudolph admitted that emotional issues
which provide a lot at student interest,
such as the Magurshak case, are rare and
cannot always be counted on to stir student
involvement. Monett also indicated that
there are simply not as many hot topics
this year as compared to last year. Aside
irom buffer days, there has not been much’
controversy this year, . ' '

“Getting a lot of student interest would
be a real big problem," allowed Rudolph;
He, said that he thinks SGA should make
the'existing issues interesting and should
promote discussion of them,

Rudolph maintained that last year there
were so many issues because, “The ad-
ministration made large public relations
errors," beginning with the scandals at
Computer Services and ending with the
student action at the spring trustees
meeting in Windsor House.

Rudolph said that as far as developing
student activity in current campus issues.
“We need someone to pick up the ball,”

Moffett, however, feels that SGA has
done a good job of evaluationg itself and
determining its future. “i think JB does
have a purpose," he said. “It‘s the mostef»
fective means SGA has of dispersing infor-
mation lo the students."

Rudolph said that if .13 acts as a focus
for student opinion, then it theoretically
has a great deal of power. JB already con—
trols a good deal of power monetarily, with
a budget of over $125,000. Rudolph stated
that SGA should take more of a leadership
role than it does now and should be more
than a “rubberstamp” for Various
organizations.

Rudolph indicated that the effectiveness
of SGA would not be diminished by cutting
down on the number or people elected to
serve on it. “Why put up the facade of
representative government when you
don't represent?" he said. His proposal, he
feels, is one way to get rid or “dead
weight" in SGA.

“The proposal was not a new idea,
though, according to Moffett. He said that
the idea to disband JB has arisen before,
and that Rudolph’s proposal was just
meant to stimulate discussion.

”I really don't want to see Joint Board
go away,” Rudolph stressed. Rather, he
said that, “This [the proposal] is a way of
trying to get discussion at JB."

Escort service
will provide
security

by Barbara Liltle

Scared about walking home alone at
night? Never fear. immediately iollowing
spring break, Grinnell will have an escort
service on a trial basis for men and women
alike, “The policy is to accompany anyone
anywhere, ” said Kirsten Skaggs,
orginator of the idea.

Skaggs was motivated after attending a
recent conierence for ACM women hosted
by Knox College.

A Knox woman spoke of the campus
security system used at her school. Skaggs
believed the system to be viable for Grin-
nell, claiming that, “Women of Grinnell
have a false sense of security ” ”Not too
many women think about danger until
something happens," said Dean of student
Affairs Jim Tederman. “They should be
aware of it now."

The escort service will make it possible
for women and men to contact the person
on duty to accompany them to his/her
destination on campus. Skaggs pointed out
that if someone needs service While in
town, they should not hesitate to call.

Skaggs has been in close contact with
Tederman and Andrea Griswold, ads
ministrative supervisor of the Health
Center, to work out the logistics of the ser-
vice. The escort service will be located in
an empty classroom in the Health Center,
and will be installed with a separate phone
and separate phone listing.

Griswold expressed concern about users
of the service contacting the Health Center
clerks, whose primary responsibility is to
take care of Health Center needs.

"This is not a Health Center serVice,”
Griswold stated, “And though we do sup
port the serum, we don’t want people to
call clerks or the Health Center for ser-

vice. ,Theservice happens to be located

here because we havc‘the'space"and'lare
conveniently’located between'North and
South campus,"

The only expense for the service, so far,
has been the installation of the special
phone. Because the phone itseli will be in a
classroom directly next to a patient room,
the bell has been replaced with a ﬂashing
light.

The service will,be in operation from B
p.m. to 2 am. every nightz~student escorts
will identify themselves by name and
general appearance over the phone, and
will show their college ID when picking up
their “client.”

Escorts will work in pairs in threerhour
shits Volunteers have been contacted
through iriends of Women‘s Group
members. Extensive advertising has not
been done to recruit escorts. Skaggs
believes that anyone who really wants to
be an escort will hear about the system
and contact her if they are really en-
thusiastic about Working. She said that
right now there are enough escorts so that
no one has to work more than one three-
hour shift in a two'week period.

Presently, escorts are purely on a volunr
tary basis, though if interest continues
through the semester, there is a possibility
of the service becoming a permanent ser-
vice with acorts enrolled in the work-
study program.

Is the escort service viable? Tederman,
Griswold and Skaggs hope it will be.
Tederman supports the service, though he
confesses to some skepticism concerning
the long-term success simply on the basis
of past experience.

Previously the service has been in-
stituted as a result or a direct assault.
Alter the initial terror had passed, utiliza-
tion of the service dwindled. Perhaps
because the service is not being tried as a
result or an assault, it will be more suc-
cessful.

Skaggs expressed those same sen-
timents. “After an ‘incident.' the service is
usually ‘hall-baked', ” she said. “Women
need to know that they do have thls false
sense of security, Basically, i feel op-
timistic about the service.”
