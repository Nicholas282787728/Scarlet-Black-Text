Those of you who were “at the movtes”
one of the evenings this past weekend were
treated to a look at iorcign languages. "15
world of international espionage and scan:
tily Clad bodies — all vital parts oia liberal
arts education.

In 3 Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe
we learned or the dangers oi mismatched
footwear. The greatest lesson to be
learned from the film was “when being
bugged, ilush repeatedly,"

For Your Eyes Only, a more commer-
cial iilm, presented other important ideas
such as: ll Never tool with a Lotus, 2)
Beware oi Greek women with crossboivs,
and 3) You'll never know when pistachio
nuts will come in handy.

This week, however, Grinnell offers a
festival at Stanley Kubrick films, Kubrick
is a great director who has changed our
views about technology, computerization
and naming our children Hal. In his most
iamous work, 2001: A Space odyssey, he
shows the extremely rapid development oi
technology with respect to man, tracing
him irom the primitive right into the space
age and beyond into the existential,

The bulk of the movie, after the first 20
silent minutes, concerns a team oi
astronauts who are sent into space in an
elaborate space vehicle with a super
computer named H.A.L. The computer
ultimately becomes paranoid and turns on
the crew

This him is a classic, thoughtprovoking
work with a catchy little tune. We have to
go thumbs up

Also slated this weekend is A Clockwork
Orange. This iilm eiiectively deals with
the experimental methods oi mind and
behavior control as a means oi rehabilita-
tion, It attempts to show both the pro's and
con‘s iii the controversial issue or modern
day brainwashing in society; hence the
mixed reviews it got irom both the critics
and the public. Those who have queasy
stomachs, beware, for this is a somewhat
diiierent iilm — you‘ll know what we mean
it you View this ilick

And anybody who is interested in
something more current will be able to en-

joy tine tare at the Grinnell Cinema this
week It is ieaturing one or the summer‘s
biggest box oiiice and critical successes,
War Games. War Games could in many
ways he considered an update oi 2001. The
iilm brings the viewer to 1933, a high tech
world where the computer is king, and the
thrcat oi nuclear war is ubiquitous.

Fine periormances by Matthew
Broderick and Ally Sheedy are at the
center oi the iilm, Broderick portrays a
computer geek who has problems in
Soho]. His proiessor, after handing back
to the class several tailed exams, asks the
class, “who iirst suggested asexual
reproduction‘7” Broderick, ”Your wile',’
He is able to circumvent his academic dil-
iiculties by logging into the school's Cﬂmr
puter and manipulating his grades

The central action or the movie begins
when he accesses what he believes to be a
game, “global thermonuclear war"
However, he comes just short oi starting
World War in,

Telling you anymore would spoil the fun.
The movie's message rings loud and clear
7 the only way to win a nuclear war is not
to light one. Thumbs up ior this iilm
leaturing Dabney Coleman.

Mister Hulo’i’s Holiday

Aiter the success oi his iii-st iilm, ioiii-
De Fete, Jacques Tati introduced Monr
sieur Hulot to the world when, in 1953, he
chronicled Hulot's French resort vacation.
So entertaining was the result, that the
film led to a series oi Hulot pictures.

Tati's humor is largely visual, with only
sparse dialogue, and although Tati is
rightiully included with Chaplin and

l White iunk is a term that seems to have
arrived in the last live years. The
nominees tor the throne to the kingdom oi
white iunk seem to be Talking Heads, Tom
Tom Club, the 8752's and Pylon. Add
another name to the list: Cool it Reba.

With the release oi their “Money Fall
out oi The Sky" EP. on Hannibal records
a iew months ago. Cool It Reba has
become the new darling oi both New York
audiences and the music press. Robert
Christgau oi the village Voice called
them; “White iunk ior visual artists
who‘ve seen the light, or heard it."

2 September 1983

The band's sound is hard to describe — a
thick, propulsive tom-tom beat working
againsthazy, echoing guitars,and covered
with very raw, almost distant vocals,
Their songs are iunny, funky dance
numbers that can be listened to as well as
danced to,

This is a band that truly appears to be on
the verge of success. Newsday called
them. “The best white New York l'unk
band since Talking Heads.” Saturday
night is a chance to catch them hot and for l
lrec. Next time, it might cost ten clams. l

because each time‘they discover more subs
tle action in the Situations depicted.
Often, Tati used contrast between
background and foreground to produce
humorous effects. One of the best known of

many such scenes is Jour De Fete: a
reaper on a hill waves his arms frantically
to ward oli a wasp, while the postman on
the road below cycles peaceiully along.
Then, the reaper, in the iorcground, calms
down while the postman, on his bicycle in
the background, starts waving his arms.
And so it goes on, the invisible wasp at
tacking each oi them in turn, The eiiect is
hilarious and typical oi Tati's style,
Tati's comedy is oiten slapstick, but it is
never overpowering and is, in iact, oiten
delicate and sensitive. As has been pointed
out, sometimes the most interesting action
is a small part oi the background. Mon»

sieur Hulot‘s comic props, the stick, the
raincoat, and the loping walk, encase an
essentially serious man who seems always
to be trying to bridge the gap between
himseu and other people.

French critics have often compared Tati
and Robert Brcsson, calling attention to
the fact that both are leading architects of
the modern cinema Both ignore the ac-
cepted rules oi timing and emphasis and,
surprisingly, Tati is as much a social critic
as the austere Bressan. For example, in
Jollr be Fete the postman’s cap is donned
by a little boy who delivers letters while
the postman takes on Tati’s idea ofa more
useiul job, harvesting. While Tati's work is
on the suriace merely a joyful comedy,
viewers should not fail to see that
underneath it is clearly a criticism of
French society, modern life, and modern
bureaucracy.
