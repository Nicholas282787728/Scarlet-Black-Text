Scots went on to provide the
final bulge of 12 points.

Drop To Fifth Place

The Pioneer scoring was
headed by George Susens,

Criniiell mainstay on theboards,
as he lead the Pioneer rebound-

The defeat dropped the Pin-

conference standings with a 775-

the fourth place spot with a

games the Pioneers should be
able to gain two victories on
the Wisconsin trip and go into
the Coe game with an ll win,

died both Lawrence and Ripon
rather handily at Darby before
