Anti-gym effort
defeated by SGA

By Tyrone Gibbs

The Grinnell chapter of the Kent
State Defense Committee Was
defeated in its efforts Wednesday
night to secure SGA funds to
subsidize its efforts,

The committee offered two
proposals to the Joint Boards. The
first called for SGA to appropriate
$75 to cover the costs of expenses
such as armbands, lwﬂets and
phone calls to Iowa City and Kent,
Ohio. This money was to have
come from the General Budget.
The motion was defeated 16 to 4.

A second proposal called on SGA
to partially subsidize a charter bus
to send students to Kent, Ohio on
October 22 if no other means of
transportation could be found and
if there were enough students
interested in going to justify the
use of a bus. This motion was
defeated 1874.

One of the major reasons cited by
opponents of the allocation was
that it would set a precedent to give
money to other political
organizations. Defense Committee
spokesmen countered this

In Focus

Brown emphasizes a

 

argument by saying that the Kent
State issue was not a political
issue but rather a “moral issue,”

At me and of the meeting, Carrie
James and Jim Stuart, who lead
the Defense Committee here,
issued a statement expressing
their disappointment with the
outcome of Wednesday’s Joint
Boards Action.

“The Kent State Defense
Committee has not aligned itself
politically with any specific group.
The students interested in the issue
represent a wide crossVsection of
the student body. Bob Greenberg
(one of those who spoke against the
funding) and several other SGA
representatives have complained
that SGA has been ignoring student
concerns while being preoccupied
with issues as Scum Africa and
Kent State. To Bob Greenberg and
other Joint Board membersiwe
can only say that it’s time for SGA
to start responding to student
concerns. There are reasons that
Kent State and South Africa keep
coming up. it is time that SGA

Turner outlines goals

By Bob Mitchell

College President A. Richard Turner Called on
private, liberal arts colleges to assure their future
vitality by maintaining a high number of women
and minorities on their faculties and ad-
ministration.

Turner made the remarks in an address on the
future of liberal arts education at a Parent’s Day
convocation in Herrick Chapel. In this speech, he
outlined a number of suggestions designed to
strengthen the credibility of a liberal arts education
today.

In making these remarks, Turner said that he was
not talking about Grinnell in particular but rather
private liberal arts colleges in general.

In order to assure that colleges continue to
possess drive and vitality, Turner called for
colleges to insure a continued inﬂux of minorities
and women among their faculties and ad-
ministration. Pointing to the currently crowded job
market for college teaching positions, Turner said
that colleges must be aware that this situation will
lead to faculties that are “very heavily tenured.”
This may result, he said, in a “generation of young
teachers" being unrepresented on college faculties,
and will increase the number of serious obstacles
women and minorities will find in the way of em-
ployment at these institutions.

r0 counteract this potential problem. Turner
suggested that colleges actively seek out women
and minorities for teaching positions.

“Nothing is more ominous than the spectre of
male, white faculties growing old together, and
nothing more necessary than policies which assure
a steady flow of new ideas, new training, and new
blood in these institutions," he said.

HE STATED that the strength of liberal arts
colleges and public perception of their work will
depend largely on the ability of these institutions to
be accessible to those “who are not able to pay the
full price" of a liberal arts education, Warning that
these colleges might become more heavily
populated with children from an affluent

background, Turner said that such an occurence
will prevent the “promise and premise” of liberal
education from being fulfilled.

In order to maintain the credibility of private,
liberal arts colleges, Turner called for a change in
public policy that would maintain the independence
of these institutions from government control while
facilitating an increased enrollment of non-affluent
students.

Last Sunday and Monday, Professor Robert
MacAfee Brown presented the Gates Lectures. The
professor of ecumenics and world Christianity at
Union Theological Seminary in N,Y.C. was selected
from personalities suggested by members of the
religious studies department. He delivered two
lectures entitled “What the Third World is Saying to
us” and “What are we to say to the Third World?”

Although he was the son of a Presbyterian
minister. Brown has not always had a theological
vocation ill mind for himself. While attending
college, he experienced a rebellious phase in which
he resisted the idea of religion. Yet, World War I!
was raging and he was compelled to challenge
the resulting events, It was at this juncture that he
chose to become an ordained Minister.

lNlTlALLY lie was a strict pacifist, but then
realized that the Hitler regime’s genocidal fury
could continue undefied; extermination could not be
ignored. Witnessing the obliteration of Nagasaki,
Brown was further exposed to the horrible reality of
warfare. Consequently, he involved himself greatly
in the realm of social Justice.

For instance, Brown represented the World
Alliance of Presbyterian and Reformed Churches
as a Protestant observer at the 1963-64 Vatican il
council. Brown also participated in anti-war ace
tivlties during the 60’s, While at Stanford Univer-
sity, he worked with various protest groups.

(change in public policy) should take the form of
provision of funds for students themselves 50 that
they may have the widest choice in the free,
educational enterprise.” he said.

IIE also cautioned against parochialism among
small, liberal arts colleges. Although he Said that
the environment of these schools, which is often
residential and rural, is one of their “greatest
strengths,” he admonished that these colleges must
develop a “new worldliness and an awareness of the
pulse of an imperfect society."

Regarding curriculum, Turner warned colleges to
increase opportunities to test social and political
theory in the outside world. The relevance of these
theories, he said, is not the main issue today. He
said that how these theories correspond to reality is

more important.

“COLLEGES should give searching attention not
simply to the history of thought, but also new
emphasis to the complex question of the relation,
or lack of it, of thoughtto action." he said.

Turner stressed that liberal arts colleges should
give new attention to those programs that would
give students an opportunity to apply what they
have learned “against the roughedged burly-burly
of society,”

IN ADDITION to these suggstions. Turner also
mentioned that liberal arts colleges need to adopt
an advocacy posture in favor of liberal arts
education. He stated that private liberal arts in
stitutious should stop referring to themselves as
“private” and classify themselves instead as
“independent "

Such Independence, he stated, requires that
colleges take adequate steps to insure that they
serve the public interest,
