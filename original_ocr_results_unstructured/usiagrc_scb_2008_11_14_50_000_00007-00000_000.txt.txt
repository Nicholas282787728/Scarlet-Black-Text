opposed to just products."

In addition [0 alternative food, this alternative business 15 promote
rng their toodsnrrrs with allcrnarivc marketing tools To build publicity
for their cupzzas, the business will hold a prornotronal “protest” ofsol'rs
outside local food establishments Marching with plywood signs pro-
claiming “EAT THIS” in big bold red letters, the young entrepreneurs
hope to attract customers with food already on their minds.

At other times, they market their product to a particularly captive
audience.

“We target drunk people." York said. “We go to parties and help
people with their hangovers." Noting that their business helped combat
both poverty and hangovers, York remarked that they were “socially
conscious, through and through."When I visited York and her fellow
“cupzzers” on a Monday night, she said it was the ﬁrst non-weekend
night they had ever produced cupzzas.

The cupzzas were being as
sembled in the kitchen of 1008
High St, where Al Green, remixed
M.I.A. andJay—Z tunes bounced in
from the living room. in rhc mean-
while, the mogrls ofAFAP busily
prepared their cupzzas and pupzzas
(a miniature varicry) to sell later in
the week.

Some ofthe innovations are simply a matter ofnccessity.“[A] lot of
ourideas come fromjust not havrng the proper materials, Wild 'said.

“Like the pupzzas came from not being able to find the large tins"

Though AFAP members describe the production process as labor
intensive, they seem to enjoy it Aho said that rhc most challenging
aspect of producing cupzzas is that “the dough is really sticky" while
Custer and York attempted with spoons and forks to pry a few stub-
born ones nom their disposable baking rins.

While AFAP seeks to capitalize on the drinking habits ofGrinncl—
lians, the busrness run by l3cn Howorr'09 and Katherine Grcgcrscn '09
hopes to capitalize on studenrs’scxual habits.

“Fetish coincides with the Gumball Challenge and we thought we
would exploit the basic princrple of people wanting to talk about their
sex lives,” Howort said. “Basically the idea was to exploit Fetish at all
costs.”

Their business model is twofold. At this weekend's Fetish party,

”We Ingrid/unit people. We
go to parties andhe/p peop/e
with {hf/i hangovers.”

the two will be running a $1 kissing booth manned by, among others,
SGA President Nco hlorake ’09 (hugs will be available for the less
adventurous). 1n the days leading up to the party they are asking stm
dents to fill out a sex survey. After —
completing the survey, students are
asked to donate 81 for a chance to
guess the ﬁnal average answers for
the surveys dozen or so questions.
Students closest to the answers will
receive sex-themed prizes.

Tire survey asks respondents
for inrormotion like how many
umcs they've faked an orgasm and
whether or not they've had an orgy At the bottom, students are asked
to indicate their own personal fetishes from a list that includes, among
others, “food,”“feet," and “whale penis."

Despite the somewhat personal questions, Howort said that very
few snrdenrs have refused to take the survey and rhat as of Tuesday
they had ”several hundred” completed surveys, with roughly 50 stu
dents participating in the raffle.

But for this business, initial success hasn't come completely without
a cost~or, at least, a Little awkwardness.

“It was cool," said Antonio woods ’10 who paid a dollar to par—
ticipate in the guessing competition. “But the only thing I suggested
they change is not to be sitting in front of you while you fill it out,"
Woods said. "They were all yes or no questions or answers with num
bers. Maybe they could turn their head or something."

Howort said that he glimpsed his own name berng scribbled by one
respondent.

Sex surveys and kissing booths may not enjoy the widespread rip»
peal to marker beyond Grinnell college but some entrepreneurs might
have businesses in their ﬁlmrc. Wilder was unsure whether his pOStT
graduation plans would feature cupzzas, saying that the business would
be most proﬁtable “ifwe can find a population ofhigh enough alcohol
abuse."

“I just think it's important to know that it’ you buy a cupzza now,
then you can say that you were there for the beginning of the greatest

of a dynasty."

This week‘fabn H T Main

An undated, unlabeled newspaper clip-
ping from Burl‘ing Library’s Iowa Room
congratulates college President John Main
for becoming a “$5,000 man." The article
writes that this salary reﬂects two things:
"The substantial material prosperity of the
college, and a fine appreciation of the services
ofthc man who occupies the presidency”

A $5,000 salary might not be mucll com—
pared to the earnings of Grinnell‘s current
president, but back then it marked the Col~
lege’s development into a, preeminent educa-
tional institution and President Main’s con-
tribution to that develo ment. In his book
Gtinnell College, John ollen—who served

as Professor, Dean, and College President from
1932 1940—writts that Marns presidency was

“in some respects the must fruirtul administra-
Live term in the history of the college."

Main started what would be a 39-year set»
vice to the Grinnell community in 1892 as a
professor of Greek. He took over the Fresh
dcncy rn 1906 and retained it for 25 years until
his death in 1931.

Because he was a professor, many thought
his esidency would be focused on academ-
ics. lEl‘he number of faculty did grow unclcr
his leadership, but so did everything clsc.Thc
student body almost doublcd and the EndOWT
meat grew from $400,000 at the beginning or
the century to 52,165,000 at the end of Main’s
presidencv, according to Nollcn.

Main is also responsible for turning
Grinnell rnto a residential campus l-le oversaw
the building of the Wornens (Andi-angle and
the Mens Dormitories, (the residence areas
now known respectively as South campus and
North Campus) bringing students from their
individual apartments in town onto campus.

With this new residential system, the Main
administration created a student wovernmcnt

for male students, governed by a student senate
at 22 members. The women students, however,
were still disciplined by the Womens league
board,” according to an unlabeled article hon—
oring Main’s 20th year at the college.

In addition to the ﬁrst residence halls,- both
Herrick Chapel and ARH were built under
the Muin presidency. Main also oversaw the
creation of Grinncll’s ﬁrst international pro—
gram Grinnell in China in 1913, where gradu-
ates taught elementary and high school in
Techow, China

Main also had a suong presence in the
greater Grinncll community He was a leader
in the local Kivmnis clu, and never missed a
meeting until he caught the sickness that lead
to his death. “His home,” srtid his obituary
in the Grinncll Herald Register, “has been a
social center for- college groups, both student
faculty and others, and here have been enter-
tained some of the greatest men and women
honored in political, civic, intellectual and so—
ciltl activities."

Main died on April 1st, 1931, just one day
short of his 72nd birthday.
