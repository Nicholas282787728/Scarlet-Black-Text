THE HUMBOLDT 5005‘”.

For some years there has been
among the tacoity a growing feels
ing that one tnember does not
readily enough become intimately
acquainted \\’llll what lti col-
leagues are doing itl their several
departments. There have been
opportunities to meet in a social
way and to hear otie another in
public address, but the occasions
have been lalgely casual and the
themes more or less proscribed.
llerrce there has recently been
started the Humboldt Sitcicty, so
called because the brothels, Alex

The society will setztbottl iis
work quietly, meeting on the sec
ond Wednesday evening or each
month in Chicago Hall. There is
little formal organization. a conts
mittee of three making arrange-
ments for programs and meetings
It is understood that all members
of the faculty belong to the so
ciety; but others who are in active
sympathy with its aims may be
elected to membership. and all
meetings are to be open to the
public.

It has been left largely to the
future to determine what the aims
of the society shall be, But a few
of the ends which its promoters

_ hope the organization may sub-

servo can now be stated.

i. it shall afford to the faculty,
and to such others be
interested, anopportunity to hear
the instructors til the college on
subjects of their own choosing
Although studies in research in-
tended [or publication may be re-
ceived with especial tavor. reports
also Will be welcomed which give
an account of the ends and
methods pursued in the work of
the department. In a word. the

largest latitude is to be allowed in
the choice ot subjects. Besides
the better acquaintance with the
aims and activt'ies or all depart-
ments of the college which it is
hoped this association ntay lostcr,
