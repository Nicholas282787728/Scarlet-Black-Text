Unconditional
Surrender

On Peace Day

by James J. Sadler

Even the Baltimore Orioles would
have trouble losing as badly as the
Grinnell Griffin Rugby Club did
last Saturday The Griffins travel-
ed to the Palmer School of
Chiropractic Medicine in Davenr
port. lowa. to play the Palmer
Quacks, Because Peace Day was
being held in Grinnell, only nine
players decided to bash heads with
the highly touted and nationally
respected Palmer team For»
tunately. the Criiiins picked up
Mick "The Destroyer” Maclean in
Iowa City to bring the roster up to
10. With the addition ol Mick. a
threeryear veteran. a feeling or in-
vincibilily enveloped the two cars
traveling in Davenport. l remarks

our own iuneral, but Freddy
“8.0." Hopkins assured me that
we were invincible. Heck, we were
going against one of the top teams
in lowa, it not the United states,
but we were riding a three-game
winning streak.

When we arrived at the ﬁeld.
Palmer was gracious enough to
give us ﬁve players when the
game began we were tied at 0-0.
The score remained close [or about
onerand-a-hall minutes. Palmer
scored and made the kick alter try
to go up 670. The Gritiins held tough

proceeded to give up 17 more trys

until the tinal whistle blew. At the
party we learned that the iinal
score was 106-0

ln spite ol the lopsided score, the
game was worthwhile because
much was learned by playing such
a high-caliber team. The most
.basic lesson, and one that was
learned by all. was that we better
not schedule them again next year

Fortunately. the beer alter the
game was icercold and everyone on
our team. except for the
designated drivers. resigned
themselves to drinking one beer
tor every try we gave up. On the
way home we remembered how
sweet it was only one week earlier
when we had beat Graceland ior
our third consecutive victory. We
also remembered how great it was
to have such a lantastic group oi
spectators. and we would like to
thank them lor their support. We
would also like to thank athletic
director Dee Fairchild lor her
assistance in allowing the rugby
club to play on Mac Field

Pioneers Sweep
Doubleheader, Make History

by Bob Litton

Grinnell’s very own lriendly cone
lines helped bring an abruptend to
a losing streak on the road. Alter
dropping three games last
weekend, the pioneers bounced
right back on Tuesday to sweep a
doubleheader irom Coe, 6-3 and
so. This was history, lolks: the last
time the Pioneers swept both
games of a doubleheader was in
1932 against Cornell. Coach Mara
tinek decided to appeal to dirterent
interests in order to shake the
streak: their appetites — promis-
ing his players pizzas and beer it
they won both. Good strategy,
Coach. ,

The pioneers (5-6) didn’t rind too
much peace (love or understanr
ding, for that matter) last weekend
atthe MidwestConlerence Tourna-
ment. Their 0-3 periormance is
especially disturbing when one
considers that they really could
have improved their conference
standing it they had brought home
some victories, Oh well, at least
it‘s over, The Pioneers bowed to
Monmouth, lllinois College, and
Knox, Bel, 7-6, and 5-1 respectively:
Save the iormer and the latter, the
Pioneers should have had a w
Up 671 against the Blue Boys
behind a stellar pitching shown by
Social Coordinator Steinman, the
Pioneers somehow managed to
lose,

The Pioneers dominated
throughout the iirst game, Down
1-0 in the second inning with run-
ners on first and second, John
Bollard singled to right to tie the
score. Erik Miller was then able to
scamper home ironi third on a
headsup play as the catcher drops
ped the ball on a strikeout. Tom
Monogue kept the inning alive,
fighting oil a couple oi lastballs
belore smashing a single into
center to make it 371 Pioneers.

Both teams remained relatively
quiet until the iitth. Coe tinally put
together a rally, with tour con-
secutive singles, tying the score at
3, But Grinnell made sure not to
allow this one to slip away, as with
two away, Mohan chopped an in
lield single which scored Cory
Jones, who had reached on a

iollowed with an iniield single oil
the third baseman which loaded
the bases lor Miller. what lollowed
showed that Lady Luck was indeed
sitting somewhere on the Grinnell
bench. The Pioneers got two more
runs without ever hitting the ball.
Miller walked, making it 5-3. The
next hitter struck out. but the cat-
cher let yet another one slip back
to the lence, which allowed the run-
ner on third to score easily. Two
easy ways to get an RBI. Grinnell

but no — Mike Mohan made a run

scare wasn’t quite over Coe load-
ed the bases beiore Sheridan ended
the late inning threat with a “’K.
For the afternoon he struck out
eight while walking only three.

Weiand pitched a gem at a
ballgame 11111158“ in the second
game, fanning eight, walking a
mere two. He also had plenty or
help, both in the field and at the
plate, to secure his shut-out with a

Nothing signilicant happened un-
til the Grinnell fourth. Jones opens
ed the inning with a triple. Alter
Monogue drew a Tree pass, Keith
Kromash singled in Jones to put
the Pioneers up lvﬂ. As it turned

out, this was all they needed. but
just to make sure, they added eight
more runs. Nice cushion.

With runners on ﬁrst and second,
Miller slapped a single to center to
put the Pioneers up 2-0. Wallace
Squibb then followed with a single
and an RE] bi his own, to make it
340

The Pioneers really opened the
floodgates in the sixth, pouring out
six more runs on six hits, only one
shy oi ending the game on account
of the lorrun rule.

With the bases loaded and only
one away, Seeley knocked a single
into right center (or the first score
of the inning Singles by Miller.
Squibb. Eric Dahlin. and PJ. Epr
pler added the remaining runs.
This made it a not~soclose so, in
tavor ot the good guys. The
Pioneers could (literally) taste the
victory.

Weiand sealed the ninerrun
debacle with two big ”k”s in the
seventh, thereby placing the 1988
Pioneers in the record book. Six
years is an awfully long time to
wait to win both ends of a
doubleheader, but when the mo-
ment does ﬁnally arrive, it sure is
sweet.

The Pioneers will try to make
more history tomorrow as they
square oll against lllinois College
