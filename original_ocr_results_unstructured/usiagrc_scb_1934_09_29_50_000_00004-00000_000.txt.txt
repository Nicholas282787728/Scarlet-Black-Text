Grinnell Women May Now

Even in Public

The chang'mg world.

There was a time when Grinnell meir
were uneasy about lighting a cigaret
whether in Gi-innoll, Des Monies, or
parts thel‘cabouls.

Then when men oi the college gaina
ed smoking irecdom, women were
handed the restrictions. The smoking
room in the basement oi Haiiies cot—
tage was the first answer to the
problem oi increased nicotine coli—
sumption among the quadrangle sex.

Nevertheless, a problem still existed,
In a number oi stores, shops, and
rendezvous tplurat), termed "public
places" by authorities, the Grinncll
coeds continued to break out their
packages ol weeds, and, when aple-
hended, spent numerous evenings re»

Last spring, a iurther step toward
"ireedcm" was taken when the

Presidents approved the move, women

might smoke at open houses in the _

incli's halls. The Council, however,
"did not choose to run," and the mate
ter was dropped.

Now the women's governing group
has taken the matter oi smoking free
dom for coeds into its own hands, and
from the archives portaming to such

matters, has struck the words “pub. .»

A Specialty

 

 

We’ve been so busy during the
past tow days that we really
haven’t had a chance to greet
you all as heartily as we might
have, but in the words oi Ling
Po; “He who may shoot the
loudest is ott’ times the one
who is never hear .” Or some-
thing.

At any rate we would like to
reintroduce our little weekly
column. To the new students
we say that this conglomeration
of type is ambitious to retell
the happenings oi the week at
the College Shop. There may be
times when you may seriously
suspect that we are trying to
advertise our shop. Tsk! Tsk!
But, as we said beiore, and will
probably say many times, don’t
blame us if we \vax eloquent
on the merits of our coffee or
hamburgers, because aiter all,
we think that they are pretty
much the real McCoy (Please
diiierentiatc between McCoy and
McGi ; McCoy doesn’t wear an
apron.)

We are trying to think up a
good trade slogan [or the CoL
lege shop. Someone sugested
“Where Romi-owes and Juli-ets”
(excuse the grammar). Anyhow,
that's out. We wonder if you
woull help us a little by making
a iew sugestions. We‘ll fix you
and your best girl, or worst
girl, or any girl, up with one oi
those niz juzzy amburgers
(there we go advertising again.)

Seriously though, we hope
that you will come to the Col—
lege Shop oiten, and remember
that alter October iirst we will
handle all the leading brands oi
cigarettes. Then too, remember
that we have just: opened the
room in which sundries were
sold last year, and it is equip—
ped with tables and chairs, with
plenty oi room ior all.

So, as Tizzie Lislr would say,
“Wine jug come up some tirne."
or was that Mae.
