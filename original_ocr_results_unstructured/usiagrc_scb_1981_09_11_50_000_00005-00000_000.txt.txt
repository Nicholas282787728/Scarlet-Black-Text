Insights to life at Grinnell

Are you a nipnort?

There's not much in life that I demand.
I'll sort oi go along with the way things are.
Up to a point. There comes a time when I
Just have to get mad,

Dan Schue has brought to my attention
an issue ‘WlllCh warrants discussion. I have
the opportunity in this column to denounce
this unpropitious situation and by God, I'm
going to take it,

I'm not sure it it's a conspiracy or it it is
someone acting alone but lately at Cowles
dining hall, whole milk has been appearing
in the skim milk dispenser

The reason I know this is no accident is
because any nipnort can read the “Skim
Milk" label plastered across the container.
There's just no way someone at Grinnell
could be such a liiiguini brain

I know I've levelled a serious charge but
if this Continues, I'll be forced to start prin~
ting the names oi guilty parties. Whoever
you are, do yourself a favor, avoid embar»

rassment. stop putting whole milk into the
skim milk dispenser

in theory, the reserve system at the
library prevents a required reading ior a
course irom being checked out beiorc
everyone in that course gets a chance to
read it in theory.

in reality, two hours is a long time to
wait The system gets itseli into trouble
through the waiting list, For instance, what
you need is checked out, so you are put on
the material at 1:25 am. out someone
ahead oi you brings it back late and

everything is iouled up.

I'm not complaining about the people
who work at the desk. They‘re great.
Especially when they have two, three or
tour hundred people screaming at them at
once. They're cool,

Dennis Aalbers came up with what I
believe is the solution Before a professor

Steve Burnett

puts material on reserve, he or she should
be required to travel between West Norris
iourih and the library i2 times between the
hours oi io p.m. and 2 am sometime in
January

i swear that so percent or the students on
this campus believe that there is some
grammar rule which states that the words
“typewriter" and "stereo" are to be used
only it preceded by the phrase "Can I borr
row your ."'7

It was incredible In less than two weeks,
a certain acquaintance or mine has com~
plated his room in the tornado style oi in-
terior decorating You can always
recognize such a room because you will
almost never see sell-propelled clothes
anywhere else

Snobbism - a Grinnell tradition?

The freshman’s first days

AS is seemingly the Grinnell tradition,
the "roast" begins at the picnic 7 the day
returning students are reunited with corn
and Quad, that fateful day when a
freshman can make or break his or her ac-
ceptance in Grinnell society, The im-
mediate grounds for exclusion from the
elite of this fine Community include the
iollowmg iaux pas irequently committed
by new students.

Choice oi apparel is the iirst potential
mistake made by incoming freshmen.
Preps are scorned. polyester raises
eyebrows and purses are out Newrlooklng
Grinnell T»shirts advertise ireshmanhood
almost as blatantly as Farrah hairstyles A
“true" Grinnellian is expected to appear in
iilthy ieans, a torn shirt purchased ior 75
cents at the thrift shop and hair which has
never felt the relief of a good shampoo and
combing. Old-looking Grinnell T'Sl’lil‘ts
either mean that your brother went here or
that you believe in doing laundry occa-
sionally

Questions such as‘ “What dorm are you
in?" and “My S.A. smokes pot * should I
move?" are dead giveaways. Even ii a
poor treshman passes the strict re-
quirements tor apparel and appearance,
this next category usually leads to
downfall. I distinctly remember an incident
from my tirst year here which illustrates
this point beautiiully By deiault, a group or
three upperclassmen happened to sit with
my lowly crew teven my transier status did
not screen me irom the brutality oi up»
perclassmen) at lunch in Quad. Alter
displaying great feelings oi selir
importance and superiority, one blase
senior opened the top oi a sugar shaker,
emptied the contents over the table and

proceeded to blow it all over his friend. A
naive ireshman piped, "How was
everyones' tutorial today?" and was silent
ed by incredibly condescending looks irom
his “elders " I mean, whal a dumb ques
tion. Blowmg sugar all over someone is fun-
ny‘, starting conversation ti e asking a
dumb questionl is "uncool “

Back to the picnic iwhich, incidentally, is
no picnic ior ireshmenl Any semblance oi
academic eagerness, interest in where the
dry cleaners are or enthusiasm tor the ice
cream machines in the dining halls defies
all rules for achieving Grinnellian status,
Meaningful ii e sullen) silence, disgusted
stares and nasty gossip identity one who is
well-established and secure enough in his
or her social standing to ieign boredom.

Okay -— it's funny They’re new and ma
competent, as brightreyed and bushyrtailed
as the surplus of tame squirrels gracing our
beloved campus. On the other hand. we are
wellracquainted with the ways oi Grinnell.
we can walk by someone without saying hi,
carry iour glasses oi milk at once 7 even
go to dinner alone (such daringt.

We've been here longer.

This Snobbism can reach hilarious pros
portions. After all, what better way to start
a conversation than with, “The freshmen
are~just so CONSERVATIVE this year."
An immediate, violent general response is
punctuated with assertions such as, “Did
you see that girl in Topsiders. Imean, how
gauche can you get?” and "She would have
voted for Reagan but she's not even old
enough to get into the Publ" However.
when a certain viciousness sets in, I person-
nally begin to iind this superficial eiietism
to be extremely oiiensive Some ioking
about ireshman ineptitude is to be ex

pected but I have heard many comments
which I believe aim to hurt rather than
humor,

Particularly popular is the assumption
that all attractive freshman women are
“dizzy," as it their pleasing physical apr
pearance precludes intelligence Am I to
suppose that the goodlooking juniors and
seniors who were once labeled similarly
magically “gotsmarl’!” Another remark oi
questionable validity and unquestioned
snideness ls, ”Why did he come here?"
Look at the way he dresses and his
political views should have led him to
George Bush's alma mater " Well, didn't
we come here, in part, to meet people who
harbored views different than our own'.’

We acclaim individuality here but only
within the confines of certain acceptable
deviations. Generally. anything
Republican, preppie, religious or noisily
Capitalist Just doesn't cut it. Unspoken
guidelines govern this community 7 you
live oiicampus (postrhastel, you skip on
Skip Day lespecially ii it is not sanctioned),
you eat land complain) at Quad.

Obviously, once the freshmen have been
integrated into the community, they too
will acquaint themselves with the petty
details or “‘withrit“ living at Grinnell.
However, one would think that having suf-
fered the “initiation rites," one would not
choose to inflict this very humiliation on
others i generalize to make a point, i do
realize that a small minority participates
in what. I consider to be hurtful and I know
that by second semester the new tacos
blend into old but why waste time closing
others out?

clarification

To the Editor.

The September 4 S&B highlighted my
comment “We’re in a holding pattern riglii
now. We're Just waiting ior when people
decide to drop out," These words could be
easily misinterpreted as an eagerness ior
people to drop out. The context oi these
words was a reference to the attrition that
occurs during the first weeks of class Last
year, for example, the attrition consisted or
approximately 25 students These students
were expected to register but didn't arrive
during the iirst two weeks oi class, They
decided to take personal or medical leaves,
drop out or attend other colleges in this
context. my point was that we need to know
the attrition beiore helping people in over
crowded rooms 7 Cordially, Bob Towner~

Alternative
Still View

To the Editor:

Having found the SAtB's editorial
challenge oi Sept. 4 to have several signiflr
cant shortcomings, we would like to offer
an alternative View

Student Government is a two directional
process. One part ot that process is the pro-
vision oi student services Although
criticized by the 5&8, these are of real imr
portance to the campus community The
5&3 failed to note that it is the proceeds
from the furniture auction which will
tinance a shortrterm loan program needed
because of the discontinuation of student
salary advances, The liquor store shuttle
and the used book sale are services affec-
ting a large number oi students and cerr
tainly don't deserve the crit’ ism of the
5&8 The focus Of the SSH!) editorial was
misplaced it they wanted a positive result.
The area Of SGA to be concentrated on is
the iormulation oi student opinion and
ideas into something communicable to the
administration oi the college. This seems to
be the area needing attention and the SStB‘s
challenge should be made not only to the
SGA but to the student body in general.
when an r-grade torum was held last year,
only 20 students showed up and when elecs ,
[ions are held for hall officers in the spring,
turnouts average less than 20 percent

The service side of SGA can be and is well
handled without a great deal of input. with
student services having doubled in the last
two years To iiiliill the rest oi its purpose
as a representative body, however, the
SGA needs the help oi those being
represented, We all need to show more Mr
[crest and the 5&8 should have recognized
this rauier than presenting in one-sided
”challenge." — Mark Salmanson 5: Andy
