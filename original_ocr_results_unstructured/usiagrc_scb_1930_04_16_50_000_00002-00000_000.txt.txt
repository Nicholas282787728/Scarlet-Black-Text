A YEAR, IN RETROSPECT.

Mixed feelings are aur‘s todsy as We cast off the
editorial tags. and pass into the shades of other editors
before us, the shades from which we can no longer give
advice, propcund ,theories nor~fol~ which much thanks
sinto which c'ritics can come to point the accusing
finger, slaying “F‘ie, rle, why did you do that?" We
say "mixed feelings" because, in looking back over a
year on the Scarlet and Black, we cannot but admit
that mistakes have been made, yet neither can We fail
to take a pleasure in certain aspects of our work on
the college sheet. Granting that our mistakes have
been numerous, we wish to gather together the loose
ends of our policies during the year past and try, by
reflection, to point out what We have tried to do.

Endeavoring to keep in mind what we stated last

fall, that the scarletland Black is a student newspaper ‘

established to record and interpret student life and
thought, we have tried to fulfill the two fundamental
function of the paper: first, presentation of news in
an accurate, complete and unbiased manner and sec~
and, interpretation and guidance of student thought
editorially.

of the first function, u few examples of what we
have tried to do may be cited. Believing intramural
athletics to be the kind of sport which should be warm-

ly encouraged, we have not only recorded accounts of
all games played this year, but have tried to stimulate
interest by ubtainingdllrdormitory and albquad teams
in all the various branches of sports. When our bas—
ketball team went on journeys south, special telegraph
reports to this paper gave the students their first de-
tailed account of the team’s play on foreign fields. For
the first time in a number of years, every musical
event of note on the campus has been carefully re-
viewed by some capable critic on the faculty of the
School of Music, that a better appreciation of the qualc
ity of Gﬁnnell's music might be built up among the
students. It was in these columns that the first clear
analysis of What the success of the endowment Cams
psign would mean to Grinnell was presented, by means
ct interview with President Main. And while on the
subject of interviews, we may say that we have tried
to present personal glimpses of all outstanding people
who have come to Grihhell this year in this way. For
such things as these, we are not seeking praise, but
only trying to indicate that We have tried to cover
compctcly. interestingly and ‘accul‘ately the events
which constitute a school year.

This has not been c year at Griuucll when especially
vexaticus problems have arisen requiring editorial
opinion, and as a result, our editorial policy has not
been flashy. Yet we have tried to Strike a new note
hy a series of editorial aimed to bring the attention of
the students to world affairs. We have done this in
the belief that while campus problems are naturally of
most immediate concern to college students, students
of today will soon be out in a. World Whose Vital prob
lem is the proper organization of the various nations
for World peace, that as educated men and women they
will have to lead society in its trend toward peace, and
that they can never expect to assume that leadership
unless they begin to cultivate while in college a warm
interest in foreign affairs. Through such editorials
we have hoped to stimuate international mindedness.

As regards campus problems, We have conducted a
chapel pull to see if there might be some solution to
the small attendance at chapel, have supported the
Pioneer chest Campaign and Grinnell-in—Chiua, have
advocated stricter observance of quiet hours, have urg»
ed a system of mixed dining, have pointed out that
mid-semester examinations should be adjusted to prep
veut three and four coming on one day, have stood for
observance of library rules, have argued for an attitude
of tolerance toward the opinions of those who differ
from the majority, and have opposed senior final exams

'We have cherished an ideal of s Gl'lnnell constant-
ly 'mproviug, land to that end have pointed out that
cri cism of Grinuell such as Ruth Sukow gave recent-
ly, should bring searching selfesuclysis rather than
condemnation, and that with an increased endowment
and growing recognition that the junior college can-
not fill the place of the endowed liberal arts institution,
the future of Griunell ought to be unusually bright.

With the next issue of this paper, a new manage-
ment assumes control. As they have been trained for
over two years in their work, we turn over control of
the paper to them with the confidence that under their
gurduncc the Scarlet and Black will strive, as in years
past, to maintain its high standard among college pap-
ers. For ourselves, while not content in what We have
doneirecalling the elaborate promises of last fall made
in the burst of enthusiasm—we hope to go on record as
having tried to make the Scarlet and Black a means
iugful force cu the campus, and as having tried to con—
slstently stand for a Wellrrounded Griuusll college.

Norris Discredits .
Tales About Snakes

Several of the perennial suake
stories, which have become current
again as warm Weather brought the
reptiles out of their holes, were dis-
credited herc today by Prof. Harry
w. Norris, head of the zoology de-
partment of Grinuell college, in a
discussion of the snakes of Iowa and
other parts of the country,

There is no such thing as a hoop
snake, Professor Norris said. “Aer
cording to popular notion, the hoop
snake cull roll like a hoop,- and cu
unwinding can sting with a thrust
of its tall, but such a Snake does not
exist.”

“The glass shake,” he said, “is
really a lizard with a long, brittle
tall. When it is struck, the tail
breaks off, but the head ctmnot rus-
tle around and reassemble the parts
as some people claim."

Professor Norris stated although
many people think that all snakes
are poisonous, fewer than half of the
two thousand known species are set-
ually venemous. He added that al—
though venomous snakes are prob-
ably increasing in India. where many
of the people refuse to kill them,
there are now few poisonous reptiles
in Iowa,

“I can remember the time.
ever, when we killed about

how-
twenty

iu the prairie. But the Iowa rat-

tlesnhkes are small in comparison to
those of the western states."
