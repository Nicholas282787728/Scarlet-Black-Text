A question

ZAiter. my ,last column, 1 was rightly
criticized by many people, including
Bill Freese and Suresh Mehta in the
next week's 5&3, for attacking the
blind followers of the anti-registration
movement without seriously address»
ing the arguments offered by their
leaders, I am indeed sorry that there
has been so much silly antl-
registration activity that l ielt the ‘
need to address a general mentality
before I could be free to face the more
serious arguments against registra-
tion. Yet Freese and Mehta thoughtful-
ly offered a classic example of the
thoughtlessness now abounding: They
implied that the Soviets were
somehow less evil in their actions
simply because the Afghans had been
given nearly two full years to learn to
despise their Soviet-backed govern
ment before the invasion occurred. I
still have no interest in responding to
arguments that can be refuted by
simply rewording them. However,
there remains a very serious and im-
portant argument against registration,
which I shall now address: it is the
question oi pacillsm.

Most people seem to define paciflsm
as total opposition to war, but the
authors of my dictionary were more
insightful. Pacifism, they say, is “the
principle or policy of establishing and
maintaining universal peace or such
relationsamong all nations that all
differences may» be adjusted without
recourse to war.” It is a principle that
has, in its broadest expression, made
me~a' vegetarian for eight years. In its
more straightforward expression, it
forced me into the Vietnam protests,
and’would lead me into the streets
again tomorrow were the President to
call for a draft to combat the Russians
in Afghanistan. But such a draft ls not
the issue today; President Carter has

posed to it, as have most advocates of
increased preparedness, The issue to-
day is registration for a possible
future draft, and the relation between
that issue and pacifism is more Subtle
than might be imagined.

Advocating draft registration while
opposing the dratt is clearly, perhaps
entirely, a symbolic gesture, (The
argument about quxck mobilization is
probably spurious in this nuclear era,
but I, for one. haven‘t the technical
expertise to be certain.) Its effects,

only whether or not an action will turn
minds away from war, but whether it
will turn minds towards true and
universal peace.

Looking at the Russians, I would
first point out the uselessness of
arguments about whether or not “the
Russians are cxpansionistic." Without
a doubt there are sizable factions
within the Politburo that are and that
are not expansionisti Since paciti 5
must be wary oi expansionism, which
generally means war, and since a
power struggle is inevitable in the
Soviets' near future, our primary
dcsirc must be to see thc position of
the Soviet warmongc who are no

hands would tic strcngthcncd try a
general feeling that the Americans

ly, we might do well to scnd a signal
that this is not the cast: tWthher or
not we should actually be willing to

question, To those who cannot con-

peace and more to the violence, sul-
fering, and evil in the world than the
actual war itscli, 1 would be happy to
recommend a few books about the cf
fects of American reluctance to enter
World War II ) lf American draft
registration can have any meaning for
thc soviets, it is surely as such a
signal. The need to send this message
l5 surely great enough to warrant the
risk that it will not be noticed, which
is the greatest risk that it entails.

Draft registration is a

symbol of the readiness
of society to protect

its deepest values.

the American psyche is of a rather rill-
