The Past Thirteen Years.

At midnight on the ﬁrst of No
vember ended thirteen years oi
hard, faithful service. A kind of
Service which requires a peculiar
kind eta man and one having a
combination of qualities hard to
Find in a single individual. The
service requires a scholar in the
broadest sense of the word; and
one who must continue to be so
all the days oi his liieI if he wishes
to maintain his position as head
ot a progressive institution of
learning. It needs a keen sense
ottherequirementsotthebusiness
world. The material prosperity
of a college, as of any other busie
ness institution, calls for executive
ability and sound judgment; the
director ot a college must be es-
pecially endowed with these qual-
ities it he expects to successiully
cope with the strenuously compet-
itive spirit ot present-clay com-
mercialism. It requires a man ct
adaptability, capable of adjusting
himselt to any circumstance and
any society. For many a friend
is won by an easy association on

 

the part of the highest represent-
ative ot the college. and a happy
adaptation to circumstancesiin
which constituency lies much of

the strength of the college, This
service calls for an inﬁnite amount
of patience to meet all the trivial»
ities and annoyances which are
sure to devolve upon the highest
in authority by the very nature of
the institution. And above all, it
must be a good man, gifted with
all those qualities which only God-
feal'ing men possess.

These are the qualities absolute-
ly necessary to a successtul col»
lege president. Singly they can
be tound in abundance. Many a
great scholar has ample scholarly
attainments, qualifying him tor
any presidency, but no sense of
business requirements. Legions
of successful business men have
no scholastic tastes, The land is
full of earnest and devout christian
men, who are easy ot address and
adaptable to any society. but have

Mrs. Gates' Place in the College.

During the thirteen years of
President Gates’ service to Iowa
College, Mrs. Gates has stood by
his side fulﬁlling the duties of
President's wife with rare ability.

Interested most heartily in the
college, whatever was tor its wel-
fare, she made her own care and
interest. Chapel exercises, class
room work, lecture courses, work
oi the womens literary societies,
the social and religious life of the
college, all received her sympav
thy, and the inspiration oi her
occasional presence.

on the many occasions which
she addressed the women of the
college at their religious andlitere
ary gatherings, she gave to them.
of her choicest thought and richest
experience.

The home, over which Mrs.
Gates presided, has been to both
students and Faculty one at warm-
est hospitality and rarest reﬁnee
ment. By its appointments,
choice abovethose ot manyhornes,
at the command of the student
body, by the social tact with

 

which she placed at ease all whom
she welcomed to it, by the
gracious winsomeness of her pres
siding presence, it remains a
legacy ot most delighttui mem~
ories to the hundreds of students
to whom through thirteen years,
it’s doors opened.

With the intent or bringing the
various personalities connected
with the Faculty into accord, Mrs.
Gates conceived the plan of what
has come to be known as the
Faculty Club,—an informal gath~
ering of all ofﬁcially connected
directly or indirectly with the
college, for an hour of social inter—
course monthly. This club has
been a delight troin the beginning
and served well the purpose,
Mrs, Gates had in mind at its in-
ception, In connection with the
Faculty club, came the thought
at bringing to the college, through
it, something ot permanent and
perpetually increasing value. For
