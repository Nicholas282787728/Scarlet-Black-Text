A Fin ai Lnsr,

After months of labor in the eilort
to cllooseaclass pill which the rest
of the school would agree upon as a
suitable emblem for a permanent
senior-alumni pill, the senior class has
settledupona design which as soon
espossihle will he made up into a
class emblem. IL is their expressed
desile that this pin be made the
senior-alumni pin, embodying as it
does several features which distinct-
irely represent Grinneil. The pin se-
lected is a design submitter] by an
alumnus and consists of a Maltese
cross carrying a college seal with the
name ol the school, motto and class
numeralsahe design which was
given rm unanimous vote of the class
twulnoliihs ago but was set aside
that the other classes might express a
preference.

It was imperative that the pin be
' chosen at once. Furthermore, it was
necessary that as little contention as
possible be aroused in the matter and
the decision of the senior class has
settled both points. It is evident
that their choice meets the approval
of many and since it also obviates any
possibility oi a discussion as to owner-
ship of the design a Strong argument
is built up in favor of its adoption as
asenior-alumni pin: Further than
this, however, there is the argument
orils appropriateness. while the de-
sirabilily of B. Senior~alumnl pin has
long since been established. Also, it
seems as ll the sincere attempt of the
seniol'class to establish such a. pin,
evidenced by Llleueil‘orts in [letting
designs, in postponing the adoption
Dl’ their own pin rind their iiunl united
action, should hear some weight.
Matters of relative beauty. class nre-
ference and Simillal‘ things are
trivial. The great thing is to accept
the chance to establish a Senior-
alilmni pin and do It now.

The SchlszT AND BLACK would be
glad when from any members of the
Freshman class or Academy who de-
sire prisibiorisau the stall. Girls are
especially urged totryior places but
choice Will be made entirely on merit.

Notice is given that the gallery at
the Freshmen Junior promenade next
Saturday evening will not be open to
the public.
