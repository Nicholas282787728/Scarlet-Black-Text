Hdmplon Exchange Pupil Finds
Train. Game Ac’rions 'Sl'range'

by Diane Doughty l

”Just a change of scenery, I
guess, and to escape from de
veloplng a bad case of Hamp—
tonitis", was the answer Betty‘
Jean Johnson, exchange student
from Hampton, gave when asks
why she decided to spend a
semester at Grinnell. Betty is
living in Read‘.

Betty, an llSnglish major from
Louisville, Ky., is spending the
second semester of her junior
year at Gri-rinell.

She hopes to .‘be an English
teacher in secondary education.
She is mirroring in math.

The impression of Grins
nell that Betty has received so
far is that it is very simlar to
her own school. The rules and
regulations and dorm life are
quite the same. There are no
cars allowed on campus and the
girls‘ hours closely coincide,

The freshmen have 9:30 p. in.
hours, sophomores and juniors,
10 p. m. and seniors lll. p. in.
These last all week but an inr
definite number of late ipe-r‘
missions are allowed on week-
ends.

The dormitories are separated
according to classes, even moral
so than at Grinnel‘l. There is
a total of five dorms: onefresh-
man, two sophomore, one jun-
ion and one senior-

Two of the things that struck
Betty as being “strange" at
Grinnell, are the way how and
girls sit separately at basket»
ball games and} the main that
rum through the center of
campus.

Founded in 1868, Hampton, lo-
cated in Virginia, now has an
enrollment of approximately
1200 students. The majority of

them are from Virginia and suT-
rounding states, though several

l . ,
foreign countries are represent-

ed.

Hampton offers several majors
that are not available at Grin-
nell such as business, agricul-
ture, technology, home econom-
ics and nurse education. Most
of the girlsimajor in either
.home ‘ec or secondary education,
while the men center on- archi—
tecture. There are very few
English majors there, so most
of Betty's classes are quite a
hit smaller than the ones she
has attended so far at Grinnell.

One factor which might ima
press the Grinnell student as
being “Strange" about Hamp-
ton’s policies, is the serious
penalty implied for ovel'»cutting.
'A student may take as many
cuts as hours he carries but
faces suspension if he over does
it. i

MacCanli Gives Figures 0n Infirmary,

Finds Men Are Rea

by Charles stegmeii-

.The common reference to,
women as “the weaker sex”
doesn’t seem to hold true as
far as sickness is concerned
When one looks at the first se-
mester infirmal’y statistics.

While 53 men spent l47 days
in the infirmary, 68 women
spent only 133 days there
and stayed an average of
only two days as against an
average stay of three days for
the men, according to isabelle
MacCann, resident nurse.

Women were most frequent-
ly admitted with intestinal up.
sets, symptoms of a cold, or
miscellaneous symptoms un.
diagnosed. lnlurics. intestinal
upsets and miscellaneous i
symptoms undiagnosed, were
the most common reasons for
men to be in the infirmary.

The causes of admission to the
infirmary during the first se-
mester were as follows: ges-
troenteritis (intestinal upsets),
16 women and 10 men; injuries,
four women and 12 men; in-
fection of the throat including
itonsillitis, laryngitis, and bron-
chitis, five women and seven
men; symptoms of a cold, seven
women and three men; allergies,
two women and two men;
glandular fever, two women and
one man; sinus infection, one
woman and one man: and mis-
cellaneous symptoms undiag-
nosed, 20 women and ten men.

The dispensaries in Main
and Smith halls had a total
of 2271 visits during the first
semester -— 1132 to the one
on south campus, and 1139 In

Ily ‘Weaker' Sexﬂ

,Lingenfelter, James sophomore;

These totals include 57 visits
to the south campus office by
members of the start, and 27
such visits to the north
campus office.

The principal program carried
out by the health service last
semester was immunization of
the student body, faculty, and
staff against flu. All students
with the exception of 12 Christ-
ian Scientists and three students
with physician's requests, and
75 per cent of the stars and fac-
ulty received the shots.

The infirmary is open for
emergencies 24 hours a day dur-
ing the entire year and is
staffed by three registered
nurses, Miss MacCann; Isabelle
Rice, Haines senior; and Helen

and three student nurses’ aides.
