IS THIS WISE MANAGEMENT?

In the years past there developed an unfortunate situ»
ation in regard to the town and college relationshlp. A.
feeling developed that was akin to outright hostility, and
it has been manifested in many ways by lack of coopera-
tion by both parties.

However, beginning last spring a determined d _d
was launched by thinki g people on both sides to elimin-
ate this feeling of hostility. Through the Grinnell Cham-
ber of Commerce, the college public relations depaltment
and the Scarlet and Black efforts were made to promote

Ibetter feelinrr. The situation was analyzed fronl both
sides and grievances were discussed and solved. And
prospects for a closer unity between the college and town
appeared bright. But this budding spirit of cooperation
received a setback this week through the mismanage-
ment by college authorities of the person appearance of
Amelia Earhar

Miss Earhart’s contract contained a clause providing
that she would make no other appearances without per-
mission of the college authorities.

The noted aviatrix is a well-known Democrat, and
when the members of the local party leamed of her visit
to Grinnell, they asked permishion of the college author-
ities to have Miss Earhart appear and speak at a county
Democratic luncheon which was scheduled for the day of
her lecture. Permission was given, and the invitation
was personally e. ended to Miss Earhart when she was
speaking in Dubuque a few days ago.

If arrangements had been left as they were then,
nothing would have happened. But no sooner had the
invitation been extended and accepted by Miss Earhart,
than the local committee of townspeople were notified
that Miss Earhart would not be allowed to speak. The
authorities, evidently feared that they might be charged
with partisianship. and they attempted to invoke the
clause prohibiting any other appearances of Miss Earhar
However. from the legal standpoint, it seems obvious
that the college was in the wrong, for the clause was
abrogated by unanimous action of the lecture course com-
mittee, when the permission was first given.

As a result of the college authorities action, there one
sued a general muddle. A compromise was finally reach-
ed after several long distance telephone calls, numerous
telegrams, and consultation with Mr. Putnam, Miss Ear-
hart’s husband. The final arrangements were that Miss
Earhart would attend the luncheon but would not speak,
and would also attend the mass reception for the college
women following her lecture.

That was the final settlement but even then the col-
lege authorities seemed unable to grasp the need for co-
operation and‘ they either deliberately or accidentally ne-
glected to notify the town Democratic committee of the
final arrangements. The result was that as late as 9
o’clock Tuesday moming, the day on which Miss Earhart
was scheduled to appear in Grinnell, the local committee
did not know whether or ilot she was going to attend the
luncheon.

Miss Earhart did attend the luncheon, and the entire
affair \vzm finally straightened out, but not without pr -
vacating much ill will towards the college. The entire
situation was poorly managed, and we hate to think what
Miss Earhart must think of Gl‘innell after this affair.
In fact we hate to think what Miss Earhart's husband
thinks of Grinnell; we hate to think what has been done
to the budding spirit of cooperation between the town and
college; and we hate to think that the heads of Grinnell
are so short sighted as to permit such rank mismanage-
ment to continue. We believe that steps should be taken
to prevent the recurrence of such an incident.

When I came to college I
thought a few things around here
should be changed, but instead
I've changed, and if you don't
like our institutions you'll have to
forgive us old fogies. We'll soon be
out of here. I'm crying; I'll have

to quit.

1 thought it was just dandy
the way our student government
took hold of the chapel problem
and solved it by the simple ex-
pedient of chmlp'ng the hour.
Which reminds me of Norton's
classic remark ,while explaining
the AnglovSExon Vi’itan. “It was
mostly big talk and no do," says
he, ”More like a faculty meet-
ing than anything else."

My faculty spy reports further
that Miss Lowden incurred the
wrath of Miss Backus lately by
eating of Miss Backus’ dog's dog
food. We knew this habit was
prevalent among the poor white
trash in the south, but this is the
first time we have noted the north-
erly trend.

We are not inclined to be nasty
as a rule but we have noticed big
Searle in the company of some
of the freshmen lately and are
thereby reminded of the old

pedition" and amplified her state-
ment by saying that no one should
overlook the risks, but rather,
should recognize and overcome
them.

A gesture of quickly upraised
shoulders and arms clasped tor
gether, and a smile, flashing and
warm, expressed most adequately
the aviatrix's love for her work as
she spoke proudly of her own new
plane, which weighs 10,500 pounds,

Describes Flight

Describing her solo flight from
Honolulu to san Francisco, Miss
Earhart spoke of the disadvantage
7the mental hazardiof public
criticism which accompanied it.
“People knocked each other's hats
off in the streets in argument
about itiand when it came to the
take-off, I glanced out of the
cockpit to see fire trucks, an amv
bulance. army men fairly bristling
with fire-extinguishers, and Warm
cn with their handkerchiefs out
obviously ready for any emer-
gency."

Smilingly, she paused to say, “I
have been asked what I think
about in the moment of take-off.
No pilot sits and takes his pulse,
but I was aware of several exterior
impressions. One was of flying
over forbidden territory at a for-
bidden altitude and Wondering in a
third person sort of way if the
navy would take a potrsbot at me
for disobeying their laws or would
arrest me upon my landing."

Hears News Broadcast

Commenting upon it as one of
"the moments" of the Pacific
flight, Miss Earhart spoke of the
radio broadcast of her take-off
which came as a news flash over
her cock—pit radio, and of the few
wnrds her husband said to her
over the radio. The flash came
thus: “We interrupt this musical
program to bring you an important
news flash. Amelia Earhart has
just taken off on an attempted
flight to the United states."

The aviatrix continued her story
of the Pacific flight, describing
the beauty of the night which im—
pressed her as she sat alone in her
ship with the stars “pressing close
to the hatch, closer than I had
ever seen them." She added com-
ments on the cloud formations and
remarked that when the dawn
came. she found the sun to her
right instead of straight ahead as
she had expected and wondered for
a moment if she had been flying
toward Alaska all night. Upon
checking her instruments and find-
ing nothing wrong with their re
cordings, she “could only conclude
that the sun was wrong and I
was right."
