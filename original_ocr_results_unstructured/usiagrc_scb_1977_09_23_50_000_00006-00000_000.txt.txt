Destry Rides Again is the
Thirties’ answer to the’ modern
filrn Cat Ballou. Unfortunately, the
film being shown this weekend is
Destry Rides Again and not Cat
Bailou. Released in 1939, which
was probably the single greatest
year for the film industry. Destry
Rides Again is a satirical look at
westerns. If Cat Ballou is not the
best western satire of all time, the
this is. ‘

The movie stars James Stewart,
and if for some reason you don’t
want to see the film because of its
star, you should see it anyway. In
1939. Jimmy Stewart was much

younger and was a much more
appealing hero. in this particular
film, he is perfectly cast as the
town marshall Destry. Stewart
gives an outstanding performance.
Incidentally, the female lead in
this film is Marlene Dietrich, who
portrays Frenchy, the quixotic
harlot of a frontier saloon. One of
the most famous scenes of the
movie is the notorious fight bet-
ween Marlene Dietrich and a
brawling Una Merkel, who is one of
the stars of the fine supporting
cast.

powerful African Nationalist
party Known as the Pan-

staged a demonstration in 1960
against the Pass Law which was
relatively peaceful until the police
of the town fired into the crowd,
killing 71 people and wounding
hundreds of others. This con
lrontation, known as the sharp
sville massacre, led to the
disbanding of this group and added
to international outrage over the

say. Oh, one more thing. The film
is 54 minutes long, and don’t ask
how long that would be in metric
units.

protests continued to mount,

Now, with the recent interest in
human rights, apartheid is
receiving fresh international at-

and Latin America. This is the
world we share with Jacques Tati
as he takes us on a 24-hour tour of
Paris in Playtime.

Tati, who wrote, directed,
produced and starred in Playtime,
is the only modern film-maker I
know of who attempts to recreate
the older and more imaginative
comedy of silent movie days. His
other films include ’h‘aific and Mr,
Hulet's Holiday, both favorites at
American art houses. Playtime is
essentially a string of sight gags
about a bus tour of contemporary
Paris. Tati is a passenger on the
tour and his presence is the signal

this week, Newsweek reported on
the death ol Steven Blko, a symbol
of hope for many Black South
Africans, known as “South Africa's
Martin Luther King.” The title
seems appropriate according to
various responses his death has
brought,

Newsweek reported that’ Biko
had died in custody after What the
government claimed was a seven-
day hunger strike. He became the
twentieth African to die in
detention this year. The cir
cumstances surrounding his death
are rather suspicious, according to
Newsweek. The magazine cited the
testimony of a friend of Eiko‘s who
had said that he (Biko) would

entire buildings to crumble into
dust and general chaos to descend
on everyone. Like the proverbial
bull in the china Shop, he is utterly
unable to turn around Without
upsetting something or someone.

Playtime, made in 1967, was
voted Best Film of the Year by
“Film Information" (which
everyone on campus reads,
right?). Its critic said that the
movie “delights and affirms the
human spirit and is a feast for the
eyes as well.” Tati is entertaining,

Reports released by the
government were found to be
lacking in credibility and [ull oi
contradictions, in response to
Biko's death, Iowa Senator Dick
Clark, who Specializes in African
affairs, denounced the South
African government for its “flimsy
explanations of what is more ad
curately a pattern of outright
racial repression."

THE uncertainty surrounding
Biko's death is symbolic of the
uncertain future of the Union of

'South Africa and its apartheid

system. It demonstrates once
again the dismal living conditions
for blacks in that country which
are a product of the often brutal
system of apartheid.
