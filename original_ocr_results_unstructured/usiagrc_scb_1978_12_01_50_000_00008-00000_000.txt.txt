“In the year 1855 Mr, Grinnell
donated the present cemetery site,
of 12 acres, to the‘ town, and George
W, Crain. with others, laid out the
lots. The aged Mr. and Mrs. Heald,
the first deceased. were buried on
the Bixby farm . . . .

‘ers. Christina Patterson,
living West of Sugar Creek, was
stricken with apoplexy, and
deceased in the winter of 1355, was
the first interment in our
cemetery. How vivid is the
remembrance of climbing up the
steep hill to the summit, and how
solemn that hour. placing the sod
in the bitter winter blast on the
first made grave in our new

The original cemetery was

under the direction of Mayor Little
in the 1870's, it was rejuvenated.

THE FINAL ADDlTlUN to the
cemetery at this time was a new
bridge that “allowed three
carriages to pass at the same
time,” This bridge was replaced in

' 1912 with a bridge built by a Des
Moines construction firm.

Under the direction of Little, the
site was enlarged, streets were
added and trees planted, all with
the help oi the townspeople. The
carpenters of Grinnell built a
cottage presumably for the grave

diggers to hang out in when things
got slow. It is unknown ii any of the
inhabitants of Hazelwood
congregated there,

THE COLLEGE also helped
rebuild the Cemetery. President
Magoun, who now resides at
Hazelwood, dismissed classes
early for two days so that college
studenm could help with con-
struction. Males from the college
performed the actual physical
labor while the college women
served refreshments.

The cemetery was plagued in its
early history with muddy roads,
even when there hadn't been rain
in weeks, according to one irate
letter written almost a century
ago.

BESIDES MUD, mourners had
to deal with the stench from a
tannery on one side oi the road and
a slaughterhouse on the other side.
Perhaps these factors prompted
one angry patron to write in April
of 1881, “A good deal of work ought
to be done in the cemetery this
spring and summer . The town is
old enough, large enough and rich
enough to bestow more care and
attention on the resting place oi the
dead.”

In 1892 the Ladies Cemetery
Association was organized. The
group dealt with finances, work-
men problems, and the purchase of
shrubbery and machines at the
cemetery. They disbanded in
October of 1954, turning the
cemetery administration and
management over to the cit of
Grinnell. The group cited lach of
interest (sounds reasonable) as its
reason for abandonment.

THESE DAYS, Mr. Gene
Martinson runs the cemetery with
the aid oi George, a neighborhood
dog. Every grave site is recorded
in one of three large and ap-
propriately dusty books, The
books, which record the name, age,
date of death. and location of each
resident, can be found in Mr
Martinson’s office on the cemetery
grounds. With the proper in»
iormation, one can locate any of
Hazelwood's happy clients.

On one wall oi the oiiice is a map
indicating each of the grave sites,
The main drags running through
the cemetery are called Elm and
Main Streets. The older graves are
found in the southeast end of the
graveyard. '

BEFORE YOU attempt to locate
the final resting place of someone,
you may want to stop into the office
to read some oi the fascinating
literature which is lying around:
American Cemetery or perhaps
Cemetery Maintenance and

After visiting the office, you
should begin your search through
the cemetery by heading up Elm
Street. Just before the large

the grave of George F. Magoun,

College (later Grinnell) from 1864
to 1534. Before he came to
Hazelwood, Magoun lived where
Pizza Hut now stands. If he only
knew . , .

JUST TO THE right of Magoun
lies H, W. Spaulding and seven
other Spauldings. He set up a
buggy factory in Grinnell at the
turn of the century and later
produced automobiles until the
Depression closed him down. He
was also a state senator and the
mayor of Grinnell.

Go back to Elm Street and take it
as it curves to the left, In this area
you can find the tombstones ofJ. B.
Grinnell and Stephen Herrick,
whose names should be familiar to
Grinnellians.

IF YOU WALK across the yard,
towards the center, you will come
upon the graves of Thomas '

three men who came with Grinnell
in 1554 to found the city, Haines
(184371921) was a gracious lady
who grew up in Grinnell. She was
one of the first women to graduate
from Gl'innell,

Somewhere out there, Mr.
Martinson attests, the grave of
Billy Robinson can be found.
Robinson, an early aviator, flew
mail from Grinnell to Chicago. He
crashed and burned to death in
March 1916 while trying to set an
altitude record, The ashes of Harry
Hopkins are located just in front of
the Payne tombstonckwherever
that might be.

gravestones, it is difficult to locate
some of the big names in Grinnell
history. This tour provides only a
handful and does not intend to snub

investigating if your favorite

So the next time you’re sitting
around your room complaining
about the dearth of cultural ac-
tivities and excitement in the heart
of Iowa, take a hike out to Hazelr
wood. And don't be afraid of ghosts
and goblins. They're all quite
peaceful out at Grinnell's historic
resting place.
