College Laundry Staff Finds Week
Needs Six Mondays: to Finish Work

Task of Washing Laundry
Employs Three People,
Reporter Discovers

By FltANcm c. HANSEN

It’s Monday every day in the
Crinnell college laundry on the
second floor of the heating plant.
six days a week Mr. and Mrs. H,
I. King and their staff of three
wash and iron bedelinen, towels,
bathing-suits, and tableelinen, be-
sides baskets-full of other things
rarely associated with a laundry.

A thousand towels are washed
there every week for the men’s
gymnasium and the sWimming-
pool alone. Add three towels and
a washcloth a week for the resi-
dents of the quadrangle and dor—
mitories, and you have a vague
idea of the amount of that kind of
work they do.

000 Napkins

Dining-rooms in the quadrangle,
donnitories, Macy, and Carney
contribute 600 napkins each week,
and three table-cloths for every
table, not to mention unnumbered
dish-towels.

Threeefourths of an acre in
sheets is the weekly quota, with a
pillow slip to go with each of the
670 making up the area.

Welcome Visitors

Mr. King welcomes visitors to
the laundry. “We don’t get much
of a chance to see the students,"
he says. He takes great pride in
showing siglit-secrs through the
process of washing.

There are two huge washing ma-
chines that look like perforated
barrels laid on their sides. The
larger one ivill accommodate all
the laundry from one cottage or
dormitory: two large canvas bas-
kets full. “Every machine-full is
put through seven changes of
water, two hot suds, three hot
rinses, and two cold rinses,” Mr.
King explained.

300 Revolutions

The wringer is a smaller metal
tub that whirls out the Water by
centrifugal action, 1300 revolu-
tions a minute. From the wringer
the clctlies go to a drying ma-
chine, which looks like an enor-
mous oven, except that it is re-
volved, the contents tumbling in-
side.

Towels and wash-cloths are
dried completely in this process;
sheets, table-clams, and other
things which must be ironed, are
dried a shorter time. Mr. King exe
plained that if this were not done,
sheets would have to be ironed
four times to become completely
dry. As it is, one turn through
me roller finishes them.

Huge Roller

The ironer is a great roller long.
er than a bed-sheet. mo women
operate it, running a sheet through
and folding it in much less than a
minute. Waiters' coats, 130 a
week, are ironed on the kind of
machine used in a cleaning estab-
lishment. A few smaller articles
are done with a hand iron.

Mr. King manufactures his own
soap from the fat and waste left
from meat in the college kitchens.
He has two odorous kettles of it
simmering in the laundry. Doesn't
it look just like taffy?“ he asked,
lifting up a dipperful. He also
softens all the water used in the
plant.
Wash oust Mops

Among the articles one would
hardly expect to find there are
dust-mops. Four bushels of them
come in to be washed each week.
Five hundred pounds of athletic
equipment was also in this week’s
quota. “We get lots more than
that during football season," Mrs.
King declared.

Every precaution is taken
against articles being lost. The
lanndry from each cottage and
dormitory comes in its own has-

 

“keLs Incidentally, they are
marked with the old names: Cen-
tral hall, Cottage Two, Building
Six, and College club. Mr. King
still speaks of the buildings in
those terms.

The Laundry from one place is
never mixed with that of another,
and when it is transferred from
machine to machine, the basket is
marked with a clothes-pin bearing
the name of the building. “1 don't
see how anything could get lost
over here," Mr. King said. Miss
Anne Elizabeth smith, house di-
rector of the quadrangle and dor-
mitories, explained that many ar-
ticles are lost because the identifi-
cation marks fade out.

Mrs. King folds towels and
keeps ironing ready for the two
women at the machine. When she
gets ahead of them, she sits in a
rocking chair by the window and
watches students on the campus.
“We can always tell that spring is
coming when couples begin to sit
around the flagpole," she com-
merited,

Both Mr. and Mrs King were
coidial in their invitation for stu-
dents to come up and visit the
laundry. “They seem to he afraid
of us, and only wander in by mis-
take," they declared. “We’d like to
get to know the boys and girls bet»
ten"

Codeds Will Hold

sociation, will he held Feb. 20 in

Desire to lTeach Termed
Important to Success
in Educational Field

Desire to teach is the most im-
portant factor for success in that
profession, according to A. W.
Merrill, acting superintendent of
the Des Moines school system, and
v. D. Patterson, superintendent of
Grinnell schools, in their speeches
at the meeting of the senior voca-
tions class, Friday afternoon.

suggestions for the prospective
teacher, made by Mr. Merrill and
seconded by Mr. Patterson, were:
first, take teaching seriously and
don’t teach unless you like work—
ing with the pupil second, pick
out a particular field to know
thoroughly. In a small school sys-
tem, the teacher may he expected
to teach many subjects, but if a
position is desired in a larger
school, the applicant for a job
must know one subject well.

Mr. Patterson also pointed out
that a teacher never makes a large
salary. He must get satisfaction
from his ability to give something
to the children he is guiding.

Prospective teachers were ad-
vised to make written applica—
tions, followed up by a personal
interview. The speaker stressed
the point that the applicant should
have all the qualifications neces»
sary for filling the position well.

Mr. Merrill pointed out that

there are a number of places in
Junior High school work that are
not adequately filled. positions
are also open in elementary
schools. “For this work, the teach-
er should know enough to teach
college people in order to teach
grade school well," he asserted.

Grinnell Poetry Society
Will Celebrate Date
of Death of Russian Pioet

The Crinnell Poetry society will
hold a Pushkin celebration at 7:45
o'clock Wednesday evening in the
little theater, as part of the na-
tional program of commemoration
of the 100th anniversary of the
death of the great Russian poet.

The program will consist of a
reading of some of Mr. Pushkin‘s
poems by Eve James. F. Walter
Huffman, instructor in voice, will
sing several songs, the words of
which are taken from some of the
Russian poet’s work. George 0.
Seiver, assistant professor of
French, will take on Plishkili’s life
and works.

Alexander Pushkin is known as
the greatest of all Russian poets’,

 

but is better known as the author
of the story on which the opera,
“Boris Godounov” is based.

Harvard President Claims
Steady Concentration
too Much for Students

Washington, D. C.7(ACP)7
“If a student in American received
three hours to concentrate on one
subject, he would die of shock.”

so said Harvard university’s
Pres. James Bryant Conant to the
Association of American Universi-
ties.

“As it is now, he has to jump
from Algebra to tap dancing to
Cherokee to Choctaw. Our stu»
dents emerge from college with a
wonderful smattering of every-
thing.”

An unidentified professor from
the south sprang to his feet and
yelled:

“Wh Our football team was
playing yours at Cambridge, and
our cheering section was calling
your boys 'damn Yankees,‘ but
they quit after the half because
they realized no Harvard man had
enough history to know what they
were talking about."
