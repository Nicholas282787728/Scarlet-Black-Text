Women's soccer shuts out Maryville, Wash U.‘

wins improve Pioneers' chances of regional tourney bid

By Doug Hodum

The women’s soccer team trav-
eled south to St. Louis this past week
end to take on two very good soccer
teams. Friday‘s game featured
Grinnell against a powerful Wash-
ington University squad.

The Pioneers were prepared for
the challenge. According to Coach
Eskildsen, the team was “as mentally
tough and physically aggressive as
any Grinnell team has ever been.“

The game remained scoreless
throughout the first-half. Five min—
utes before the end of the half, goalie
Susan Flowers made a beautiful divA
ing save to keep the game tied.

Grinnell broke the Lie twelve min-
utes into the secondhalf when for-
ward Anya Schwartz dribbled the ball
close to the WashU. goal and dumped
a pass off to her left to midfielder
Amy Jo Reinhart. Reinhart one

Cross country improves
third place at Augustana I

By Terra Geiger

___—._

Last Saturday, positive thinking
led the women‘s cross country team
Loadtirdplacef'mishattheAugustana
Invitational.

Grinnell ﬁnished third with 91
points behind Augustana‘s 36 and
meet champion Luther’s 19 points.
Coe college, the other Midwest Con-
ference team competing, finished
fourth with 141 points.

Every Sunday the team has a lec-
ture on a topic that is intended to aid
in their training. Last week’s topic
was on afﬁrmation.

“Instead of saying ‘Ican’tdo this,’
we concentrated on saying ‘I've got
to do this’ and ‘l feel good.‘ We putit
into practice all week in training and
at the meet and it worked," Freeman

touched it past Wash U. goalie Jen
Haddad for the only goal of the game.
According to Eskildsen, Haddad is
consideredby some coaches to be the
best goalie in the nation.

The Grinnell defense once again
held fast and recorded yet another
shutout.

Eskildsen saw “manypcoplc grow
up and gain confidence" through the
Wash U, game. He was “extremely
pleased with the play of Amy Neevel
and Sarah Edmonds." Gucn Gifford
“solidified herself as a solid stopper”
for the team. Overall, the team played
very well together and beat a tough
opponent, he said.

After such an important win,
Grinnell needed to prevent a letdown
against Maryville. Well, thatletdown
never came as the team rolled the
score up to 7-0.

Grinnell spread out the scoring as
six differentplayers earned goals for

said.

Runner Jill Celina led all Grinnell
runners with a 13th place finish, She
was followed within seventeen see-
onds by Sandra Robinson, Jessica
Henry, and Teri Derrickson who ﬁn-
ished 17th, 18th, and 23rd, respecr
tively. Rounding outthe lop seven for
the skull»crushers were Amy Harris,
28th, Kara Beach, 30th, and Jennifer
Jacobsen, 34th.

Runner Mila Dever compared the
Augustana meet to last week’s Les
Duke mect. She said, “Grinneil’s
course is a really hard course because

it is so hilly. Also it was really cold
and windy. Augustana‘s course isflat
and the weather was great Most of us
ended up mnning our best times."
Freeman was equally happy with
the race. She said, “In practice all

The team defense again held fast
and prevented the opposition from
scoring. The Maryville and Wash
ington University wins battered the
Pioneers chances to earn a national
tournament bid.

Grinnell has not allowed their op—

Despite this impressive feat,
Eskildsen claims that the learn will
“work even harder on defense now."

Grinnell defeated Coe 6-0 on

shutout.

week we focused on running an even
paced race. We pretty much achieved
that goal. It was nice to see so many
people drop their times substantially."

Freeman praised theraces of Cet‘tna
and Harris as both runners moved up
a couple places on die team.

The focus of this week's practice
is working on stickingcloser together,

"There’s no reason we should be
so strung out when our first four runr
ners are only seventeen seconds
apart," Freeman said.

The team's next two meets at
Carleton and Coe are run on courses

much likeAugustana‘siflatand fast.
These courses will give the team an
opponunity to work on different as-
pects of their race.
