greater number of American born mu-
sicaiis in its personal] than any other
American orchestra. More than half
oi its members were born in this coun—
try. other countries represented are
Italy, France, England, Denmark, Aus-
tria, Bohemia, Poland and Germany.
Marciano D. Aquino, who plays in the
second violins, is a native of the Phil-
llppines who is in America acquiring

H. lllnx Steintlcl, ’(‘ellist

orchestral experience with a. V'lEW to
securing a governmental position to
take charge of organization orchestras
in his native country.

The orchestra is organized accord
ing to military formation, with a cap-
tain, or lender, for each section, an as-
sistant conductor, who occupies the
position of regimental adjntzmt. and a.
concertuiaster, who corcsponds to the
lieutenant-colonel iii a regiment, The
conductor is the cammnndcrrinrchiel'i
This formation is followed in all or-
chestras of more than ﬁfty men, and
is rigidly observed.

Conductor Rudolph Ganz is the com-
mander-inr bier, with concertmaster
Michel Gusikoli, ﬁrst violin or the or-
chestra, as his chief lieutenant, and
assistant conductor, Frederick Fischer
as itdjutanl. Concertmastcr Gusikoff

 

SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IS NOTED
FOR AMERICAN BORN MUSICIANS

is the leader of the orchestra—under
Conductor oanz, ot course—and sets
the rules and etiquette to he tollowed
by the remainder of the musicians.
The men ncvci- move from their seats
at the end 01 a performance until Con-
certmaster Gustkoff has risen, and
none ever leaves the plattorm before
him, even it he has remained to chat
with somebody in the orchestra.

To Assistant Conductor Fischer he.
longs the duty of conveying instruc-
tions other than rehearsal work, from
the conductor to the men, keeping
them up to their orchestral duties, see-
ing that they are at hand when want»
ed, and other routine matters. The li-
brarian, Elmer Gesner takes care of
the music both in its distribution and
collection. Fischer is also leader of
the bassoon section, and Gesner is
leader of the Percussion section.

H. Max Steindcl, ﬁrst ’cello and
leader at his section, might be said
to correspond to a military major.
The Walk) choir is next in importance
to the violins, and its leader, theretoi-c,
ranks second only to the ccncertmas-
ten. Steindcl is an artist of interna-
tional reputation, as a soloist as well
as orchestra player.

In several of the compositions to be
given in the concert here on April
17th both steindel and Gusilmt‘f will
have important parts.

The orchestra travels in two 519%
cicl cars. This is the seventh stop
in its present tour, which it is mak—
ing under the personal direction or
its manager, Arthur J. Gaines, of st.
Louis.
