2,000 Watts
of Electricity

“A waste of 2.000 watts of elec.
ticity has been revealed by check-
ups being made twice daily in an
efiort to reduce the consumption
of electricity," according- to Mr.
Theodore Thomas, supel‘Vlsor of
employment, who was in chargc of
the survey.

Two students, Walter Klein and
Walter Dawson, are going through
the dormitories twice daily to see
if any lights are left burning while
the occupants of the rooms are
not there. Reports of such waste
are made, and students will be re-

quested to see that it loes not
continue.

”Students who continue to wastc’

The investigation of the amount
of elcctricity being used resulted
ironi a vast increase in the amount
consumed this year as compared
with the amount used for a simi-
