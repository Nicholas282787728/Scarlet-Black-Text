THE FRESHMEN WON IT.

Hard Class Meet or Saturday Atrernoon
Goes to the Younger Classiclnw
rhe Star Perrorrner,

Amidst a blinding downpour ol
rain the Freshmen athletes won
the Foster Trophy upun Saturday
last. The result was as expected,
but the strong opposition encoun-
tered from the sturdy Sophomores
was a surprise to all. Event alter
event went to loud, whichthe dope
ﬁends had awarded the Freshmen
without a struggle. At one time
a Sophomore victory looked pos
sible, but the newcomers rallied at
the last and won out by the nar
row margin of 65% to 56%.

The records made were poor,
but excusable, on account of the
weather conditions. About three
o’clock a perfect cloudhurst ocr
curred, but this only marred the
meet. thanks to the cinder track
and tenacity ot the spectators, of
whom but a score failed to brave
it out. The contending classes
each sent strong rooting delegar
tions. Freshmen caps vied with
Sophomore umbrellas tor the
popular favor, and at times the
peals ot thunder were smothered
in the hoarse cry ot lusty throats
as some champion distinguished
himselt. Upper classmen present.
although unable to take active
part in the meet. shared equally
with the contestants the attention
otthe majority during the closing
moments.

The Freshmen were strong in
the hurdles and ﬁeld events, but
were outclassed in the runs by
their opponents, Cloiv. tor the
Freshmen, did all that could have
been asked of him and was easily
theindlvidual pertormer, with 23%
pointsto his credit. The work of
Dellaan in the 220 and doe-yard

clay, Results of the events tollow:

HOME MEET SATURDAY.

A close Meet it not a past one Expected.
Some Tips on the Races—Juniors or
Preps Will win.

The meet oi last Saturday
though much closer than many
expected was by no means a fast
one, andit is fairly sate to say
thatthere willhe no startling time

is not in his usual torm. Temple-
ton and Robinson together with
Moir will however turnish plenty
otvery warm competition, The
440 promises to be more or less
at a right. Robinson perhaps
looks best. De Haan with his last
week’s showing made some ot the
wise ones open their eyes. yaqua.

shape on Saturday. Denise and
Trigg will also ﬁgure. The

will lie between Barnard, Weber
and Knowlton as far as can be
seen at present. The hurdles Wlll

long runs, Mcllrath and Marvin

doubtless others make it diPﬁcull
to judge the winners the
weighls. The ﬁrst named will
have the advantage of good train'
ingii-hichis sure to bring results.
Looking at the meet from the
class stand point, the Preps and
Juniors seem to have the best
chances. The showing made by
the Freshmen last week causes
them to be much less thought of
than at ﬁrst. The scarcity of
meninilie sophomore and Sen
ior classes render their chances
slim to say the least.
