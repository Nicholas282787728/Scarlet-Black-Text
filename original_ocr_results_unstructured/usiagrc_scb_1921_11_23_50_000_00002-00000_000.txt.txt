“DUCK DRAKE” ,
Thruout the Week, the spirit on the
campus has been the best that has
been shown here this season. Every-
where there has been 3. unanimity of
feeling and of determination to "duck
Drake." Starting With the big men’s
meeting in the dormitory dining room
Sunday evening, there has been a con—
ELQJJY. increase In enthusiasm and ﬁght
that has spread thruout the entire
school. In the” classroom. at the pep
meetings, and on the campus the chief
topic of conversation has been "duck
Drake.”

it is this cooperative effort. the idea
that “we will." the joint determination
’of team and student body to end the
season with dispatch and satisfaction
that will carry Grinnellians to Des
Moines on the special tomorrow to
see the annual cr-lnnell—Dralre battle.
The united efforts of any group must
make an impression, and the concen-
trated enthusiasm of the school can-
not help but he felt in the coming

game. _

Thruout the Week, the team has
been working as never before and has
accomplished much in the short time
allotted to them. Weather conditions
have been bad and it has been diffi—
cult to get effective practice, and yet
the men and the coaches have kept
dghung, willingly sacriﬁcing time and
energy and undergoing numerous dis-
agreeable conditions because they are
gladly going to give their best to the
Pioneer alma mater 1n the ﬁnal game.

The season itself has not been para
ticularly successful in view of the
number of victories, and yet it has not
been a failure. Grinnell has sustained
her reputation for always ﬁghting, she
has gone against some of the strong-
est teams in the Missouri Valley con—
ference and she has always given a
splendid account of herself. With the
cooperation that has been given by the
coaches and the team, it is impossible
for any season to be a failure.

Under such conditions, it is only
sportsmanlike that the students he as
ready and as willing in their sacrifice
as have been the Pioneer representa—
tives. Faith will do a lot but it takes
more than spiritual rooting on the
side lines to cheer the team along andl
to assure success. it may seem hard?
to forego that Thanksgiving dinner at
home, but Christmas is coming and it
will not he a long postponement of the
family reunion. Every student owes
it to the team, the school, and himself
to help participate in the annual “duck"
Drake" festivities tomorrow.

is entirely possible that some or the
seven will not get to play in the ﬁnitl
game of the season but the mere fact
that they are there in reserve is proof
of the sacriﬁce that they have mitile,
and are making to insure the success
of the team this year, It has required
no small amount 01 loyalty on the
part of these men for Lhem to go thru
the enﬁre season, and this is also true
of ﬁne DLlIBK' members of the squad,
suburdiuating individual desires for
the good of the team and the school.
Let’s Show our appreciation by going
to Drake tomorrow and supporting
them in their ﬁnal effort for Grinncll
