While in pursuit of an elusive
golf bag, Flohili Hubbard, Grim
nell beauty, last week became
lost in the realism of Des Moines’
underworld. Not realizing her
peril she stepped lightly into a
joint to ask her whereabouts.
Just at the moment a hairy hand ,
was stretched out to snatch her
and a cold muzzle was being
thrust into her ribs,, a stalwart
young man picked her up. carried
her screaming from the retreat or
the thugs,‘ and only released his
hold when he placed her before
the doors of the Spauldlng' Sports

young man was, recognizing only
the brilliant flash of a detective-s
badge in her confusion. She has,

Can it be that our Dean of Men
is at last succumbing to the Spir-
it of Grinnell? It would seem so
when he parks before Cooper
School with two young ladies,
The observer of the :episcde lied
in horror at the sight, and is un—
able to report further develop-
ments. At any rate we offer con-
gratulations to the two lucky

girls.

The numerous rushes from the
floor at the Junior Prom should
not be attributed to an alcholic
indulgence; it was sea»sickness.

Soon the sun will shine again and
picnic weather will be back. Supply
yourself with a Kodak and films,
and have memories of the best sea-
5011 of the year. You'll find East-
man cameras and film at child Art
Rooms.

“The wild ﬂowers of our woods
and prairies are rapidly vanishing,”
Dr. Conard stated today. “Many of
our ﬂowers cannot recover after the
tops are plucked orr. Many are
pulled up by the roots. Iowans used
ito know many a glorious wild garden
where today everything is rooted out
and gone.

"So serious is the situation now
that a movement has been started
which aims to interest the public in
the protection of wild ﬂowers. This
movement is sponsored by the Iowa
,Academy of Science, which includes
nearly all the scientists of the state,
and the state Fish and Game de-
partment, which is the orticial bu»
read for the welfare of wild life in
the service of the people."

Creighton Dual Track Meet
Is Canceled, Slates Caacll

The Creighton track team, which
was scheduled to meet the Grinnell
college trackmen here in a dual meet
May 17, will not appar here this sea-
son and J. C, Truesdale, director of}
athletics is now endeavoring to
schedule another meet in its place.

The meet was called off at the re-
quest of the Omaha school since
track hopes are rather slim theIe
this season. lCoach Chet Wynne, of
the Biuejay track team, has not been
in Omaha this spring and conse-
qllently has been unable to devote
his time to developing track men,

There is a possibility that the MisV
sourl valley meet, scheduled to be
held at Creighton May 23 and 24
may be shifted to another college in
the circuit with Grinnell as a likely]
prospect. ) BLACK.
