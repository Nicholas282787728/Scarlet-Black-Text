The
Ultimate
in IM’s

If Intramurals seem alien to you already
this year, blame it on those ﬂying saucers
that hover over Mac Field every after-
noon. At least tor this year, the game or
Ultimate Frisbee has replaced flag toot-
ball on the Intramural sports list.

According to IM cocoordinator Paul
Kleimann, Ultimate was introduced this
year as an alternative to the rough and
largely malerdominated toothall.
Kleimann has observed that though many
students are unahppy with the switch, par-
ticipation, “especially among the
women", has greatly increased. Kleimann
also noted that the degree or come
petitlveness is not as ilerce among
Ultimate participants, encouraging more
people to become involved. Randy Seeley,
though a diehard iootball ian, agrees. says
lng that Ultimate is less athletically based
than football.

For those unfamiliar with the game,
Ultimate Frisbee consists of two nine-
member teams The object of the game is
“to pass the Frisbee to a teammate who is
positioned in the opponent's endzone.” The
most important rules direct that the
Frisbee move only when airborne; no
“hand-oil's" or “movement with posses»
sion" may transpire.

The other IM sports-soccer, volleyball,
basketball, Special Interest basketball,
and softball, remain as in previous years.
Hall Scorers are compiled in the following
manner: 4 pts.-participation; 5
pts.-playoits; e pts,~'1st round playoii vice
tory; a pts:2nd round playoff victory; and
to points tor becoming champions in any
sport. In looking forward to a healthy lM
year, Kleimann warned, “Remember.
let's be Careul out there." The other IM cu-
coordinator, Terry Chapko, was
mysteriously unavailable ior comment. . ,

The Grinnell Pioneer football team
begins its season for real this week when
they take on Concordia of Wisconsin. The
Pioneers return 17 suarters from their
team of last year that went 3-4 in the ruggr
ed Midwest Conference.

Coach Martinek feels this year‘s team is
ahead of schedule as compared wiﬂ'i teams
of recent history. He credits this to several
factors. First, the team has been able to
accomplish more in their preseason prac-
tices because they had more oneaday
practices instead oi two-a-days. Martinek
said he prefers this format, Second, most
of the returning upperclassmen reported
back in better shape than last year. Final-
ly, the freshman class is more talented
than the Coach expected. All of ths makes
for a better overall chemistry among the
1986 Pioneers.

The team saw its first new meet least
Saturday in a controlled scrimamge with
Graceland College. Despite the fact that

against Cornell is any indication, the
Pioneer women’s Cross country team is
likely to continue its six-year string as a
top conierence contender, ‘

Coach Evelyn Freeman noted that the
race was only two miles a standard
women’s races are three miles 7 and was
thus largely “to see where we are and to
try to get the feel for racing again.” Never-
theless, the Pioneers‘ victory Saturday lett
Freeman “very pleased” with the team’s
periormance.

Last year’s top two runners, Jenniter
Bishop and Shavaun Adams, placed lst
and 2nd Saturday, and are expected to re-
main tough conference competitors, Addi~
tional strength and experience is being
provided by returnees lngrid Hutter and
Marianne Carlson, both seniors, and junior
Beth Powers. Freeman expects help irom
senior Mary Lanaghan, junior Dorothy
Shearn, and sophomore Blair Davison, all
newcomers this season, as well as from
Mary Lee Crawley, tarnsier irom Bates
College.

As for the three new freshman runners,
Freeman noted. “They look like they’re in
pretty good shape tor this time or year.
Freeman said, “On the whole, our team is
stronger than last year.” Besides the team
depth already cited, Freeman indicated
that another factor contributing to this
strength lies in the fact that most team
members followed some sort of summer
training. “We haven't had to start from
square one in training like we've had to do
in the past,” she explained.

This weekend the Pioneers compete in
the Cornell College "Ram Run” Invita-

and will likewise compete in the 13 team
“Ram Run" tomorrow.

Coach Will Freeman was particularly
pleased with the success of “pack runing".
“We allowed one runner to get away, but
the fact that we had 15 runners Come in
before their fifth man shows our depth,"
he said. Since there are no designated run»
ners at the “Ram Run”, all of the men will
again compete to give Freeman a better
idea about iuture placements,

athletic scholarships, the Pioneers fared
well, Although no score was kept, Mars
tinek was pleased with what he saw in the
game. "The team as a whole performed
better than expected ior this early in the
Season." said Martinek.

However, he says that there are still a
few things that need work, mostly inter—
nalization oi good basic technique. strong
points in this year’s team are better
overall team speed. and an impressive
multiple offense that returns veterans
most of the skilled positions,

The defense looks to be vastly improved
over last year, especially on the iront line.

This Saturday the Pioneers take on Con-
cordia at home. Keys for the Pioneers to
emerge victorious are controlling the line
oi scrimmage and playing good solid foot-
ball. Concordia has good people in their
skill positions, especially a pair oi running
backs known as “the Spaghetti
Backfield". This season’s Schedule is
tougher overall said the Coach, but then,
so are the Pioneers. Students are en»
couraged to come and support their team.
