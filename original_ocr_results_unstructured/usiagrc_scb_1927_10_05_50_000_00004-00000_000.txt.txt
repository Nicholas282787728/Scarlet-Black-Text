F rosh Football
Squad Imposing

Freshman football prospects seem
fairly bright this season. ' Several
high school men of good calibre are
attending Grinnell this year, and
should materially strengthen next
year's varsity squad.

The freshmen have an able hack-
ﬁeld in Alex, Hakendort, Douglas, and
Riohey. Briuenstine is also a hack of
more than ordinary ability. The line
is fortified with several men of good
high school reputation, such as Esk—
wall, Fi-erlericks, Humphrey, and
Minier. Letton, Stevenson and Hurl-
burt show much promise, while Fee
is a center who was good in high
school and looks good here.
