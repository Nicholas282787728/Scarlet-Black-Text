the bla-it which signalled tli
escape of the' Bttbtlie

tiye garb of lady at quality and
Gavin lcnltzes for the ﬁrsttinle
that [its beloved is not the dele-
lict he had supposed but the
daughter of :i Lotti, Barbara do»
clares she t\il| nlalry no one but
the one whom her {other is about
to have arrested. Gavin is atlgl'ir
ly dismissed and the two redcoat-
ed dignitaries who remain on the
stage discover much to the SatlS'
faction ot Lady Barbara that the
little gypsy and Gavin Dysliart
were man and title according to
the law of Scotland, they having
confessed themselves as such in
the presence of witnesses as a
means otavoiding the arrest otthe
gypsy, a ruse which the Captain
and Lord Rintoul little tinder-
stood as yet. Lady Barbara is
told of the Little Minister's ap
parent duplicity and she feigns
resentment and a desire to see the
traitor arrested as her father had
planned. Off the daughter goes
chuckling up her sleeve and cling»
ing to her father’s arm in a mood
which the benign old gentleman
interprets as despair and resigna-
tion.

or the next act. Prayer-meeting
has just been dismissed and the
elders are there to discuss the
situation. Gavin arrives on the
scene and is received coldlyr He
tried the Manse door. It is lock-
ed and he demands the key which
Thammas Whamond refuses him.
