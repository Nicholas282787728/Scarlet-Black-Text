Gillespie charges ‘biased journalistic practices’

To the Editor:

The Oct. 19th editorial commen-
ding various campus groups for
their political acitvity and
crediting them With fostering a
more politically aware environ
ment on campus seemed
somehwat odd to me. I read and
reread the editorial but still found
no mention of ”The OUlcry", the
college Republicans, or even the
college Democrats. Yet I did find
the editor lauding the Socialist
Party and CRPEAG. Was this
omission accidental? I think not;
groups such as the campus
Democrats were not included in
the editorial because the editor
does not agree with their political
positions and, therefore, sees no
need to recognize their role in
fostering a more politically aware
environment. THe most disturb-
ing part of this selective editorial
is that it is but the tip of proverbial
iceberg. The s a Bin general, and
this semester’s editor in par-
ticular, have made no attempt to
present campus, state, or national
issues in an unbiased way. The
editor has used the S & B in an ir-
responsible and reckless fashion;
the paper has been used as a
political manifesto at the almost
total exclusion of iairly presented
opposing views. This is not good
journalism.

I realize that the position of S &
B editor is a difficult one. No
academic credit is given for a job
that takes a good deal of time and
dedication. Therefore, it stands to
reason, that whoever takes the
position should be entitled to cer
tain liberties beyond those nor
mally given to an editor. 1 also
realize that editorials will take
clear positions on issues reflecting
the editor’s viewpoints. The pro
blem with this semester's editor is
that he has taken advantage of
these liberties with a vengeance.

From the utterly indeiensible
use of editor’s notes to the running
of “bylinerless” partisan attack
on President Reagan [on page one
no less], the editor has violated
almost every norm oi fair and
balanced journalistic practice.
The most blatant affronts to good
journalism are the infamous

In spite of the great protest over
the editor‘s abuse of his powers he
made no public apology to those
victimized by the notes nor to the
S 5: B readers in the following
issue. Instead we got an editorial
attacking the SGA'S funding of
“The Outcry". That editorial,
quite wittily, pointed out that
many people who were in iavor oi
the all campus referenda last year
were opposed to a campus
referendum on the issue of “The
outcry'Tunding The editor
characteristically neglected to
mention that many ot those who
were opposed to the reierenda
process last year were those ad-
vocating a referendum on u’liS
issue. The editor seems unable, or
unwilling, to see any fault or icon-
sistency with positions he agrees
with.

“byline-less" article in the Oct.
12th (actually it was little more
than a quote of Walter Mondale’s)
was but a thinly veiled partisan
attack on Ronald Reagan. The
“article” was not newsworthy
because it did not add to an
understanding of die issues of the
1984 election and certainly did not
belong on the iront page. Yet
another example of the biased
nature of the S & B‘s news
coverage is the interview with
Cooper Evans in the Oct. 18 issue.
The apparent purpose oi the inter
view was to use Cooper Evans as a
surrogate to attack President
Reagan 7 not to inform thc cam-
pus oi Congressman Evan’s own
views (a_iocus that might have
been more beneficial to the camr
pus community). The reporter
iound Cooper Evans reasonable
only because he disagreed with
Reagan on some issues 7 not on
his own merits.

bias in the s at 8‘5 news coverage

were more easily influenced by

supported Jepsen. The suggestion
here is that people who support
Jepsen did not carefully analyze
the issues and, thus, make an i

telligently weighed the issues they
would have seen Harkin as the on-
ly “correct choice", This type oi

Second, Gillespie would find
that prus releases usually aren’t
given by—lines in any publication,

Third, based on what Gillespie
might find in any text written
about appropriate practices in
journalism. would he have found
it to be more intelligent of the
editors to have labeled a news
analysis piece with a hard news
lead?

Finally, if Gillespie were to chat
with anymore of the conservative

they had in fact been invited to

‘Ideological biases’

T0 the Edimr:

“helped prevent the campus from
becoming an apathetic

have indeed done much toward
regenerating Grinnell’s tradition

cry” is an activist publication, as
are the iormer activist groups, We

high. Why. then, were we not
numbered among the saved in
your editorial?

Perhaps an answer can be found
in your use oi the adjective “pro-
gressive” to describe the groups
you listed, as well as the groups
you chose to exclude. Maybe the
organizations which were men
tioned represent some sort of
coherent, overarching
ideological commitment which
can becalled “progressive". Bull

know, no Latin American country

do nuclear missiles concern
themselves with Latin American
culture or politics. Where‘s the
connection? If these groups do
represent, in your opinion, a com-
mon ideological theme, then you
contradict yourseli when you tell
us that we should immerse
ourselves in iffering modes of
thought, and increasingly diverse
perspectives.” Given this state-
ment, the predominance on cam-
pus of a combination of groups
dedicated to a single ideological
orientation is exactly what you‘re
against. 1 ask again: why not in-
clude other diverse activist
