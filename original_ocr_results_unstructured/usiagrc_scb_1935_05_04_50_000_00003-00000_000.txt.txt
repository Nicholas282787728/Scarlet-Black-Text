Ah, the great Horse Race! Cob.

a horse toward the college, int.

bIe entered into negotiations with
Badger to rent the horse and Iin.
ally hit upon the price of 15 cents.
It seems that Badger was standing
in front of the horse when Cobble
rented him and from the looks
oi the race Cobble ran, Badger
must have been holding the horse

up with one hand at the time.

Famous Educator Declares
College Students “Softies”

Kansas City, Mo.7(ACP)#Too many
of the nation’s colleges are turning out
‘softies” into a hard world, John Ers.
kine, professor of English at Columbia
university, asserted here recently in an
interview.

“1 never want my children to be
pampered the way colleges pamper
their students,” he declared. “A young
fellow gets in a mix-up of his own
connivance and is put in jail. Away
hurries the dean of men to bail him
out and fix everything. That's typical.
Every time a student falls there is
someone to pick him up and brush
him of ."

colleges, Dr. Erskine declared city
colleges are showing bad signs of it,
but his explanation of the tendency
he had noted was given in a humorous
way.

hy Reviewer

By Carl A. Niemeyer

The presentation of the original o‘ne
act plays given at the Alumni Recita.
tion hall auditorium last night opened
with Maurice Birdsall's “Public En.
emies," a comedy of the slapstick
school which relied for its effects
largely upon making the characters
gesticuiate, fail over each other, and
roll about on the stage. Betsy Ross,
using the technique which she so
successfully exploited in “Gammer
Gurton," was easily the star of the
performance.

“A Tip for Ellie" by Truly Trous.
dale, to which one of the three judges
voted to award the Henry York Stein.
er Memorial prize, presented the
amusing but somewhat unbelievable
situation of a man, who, having com.
mitted bigamy, tries with $12.50 to
bribe his iirst wiie to be silent. Kath.
erine Six as a moronic and irustated
siattem made what was really a minor
part the most interesting one in the
play, even though her acting rather
often suggested a careful study oi
the work oi Louise Fazenda,

Susen’s Play Good

Most of the audience must have
agreed with the own judges who voted
the Steiner prize to Mrs. Barbara
Phelps Susens far her historical play.
“Aaron Stevens, Abolitionist." The
play was a dignified and interesting
story of a Quaker girl, played by
Florabel Houston, who finds that her
love for the courageous but unortho.
dox abolitionist who gives his name to
the play, is stronger than her re.

Ray Goodenow, who had rehearsed
the title role loss than a week, spoke
his lines beautifully and [or the
most part unhaltingly; his diction and
phrasing are especially worthy of note,
The play itself, with its romantic use
of historical setting, had more flavor
than any other work presented dur.
ing the evening. The moments before
the fall of the curtain, with their sug.
gestion of the impending tragedy that
awaits the lovers, were even moving.

“May Basket," A Comedy

Robert Irwin’s ”May—Basket" was a
pleasant comedy about a negro Com.
munist who has been taken up by a
couple of college students. The com.
munist, deftly played by Cliiton Lamb,

has, happily for the sensitive nerves
of the ladies oi the audience, forgot.

Saved by the quick thinking of a
young co.ed (Helcn Rogers) from
being implicated in the plot, the two
students (James Cameron and Harry
Duncan) watch the communist carried
off by a policeman and themselves
set out for a college dance.

As a group the four plays were
interesting, although not all were

 

equally well written. “Public Euimies
got oil to a slow start, and "A Tip
for Ellie” seemed too improbable to be
taken seriously. The most satisfying
play was that oi Mrs. Phelps, which
avoided farce and told dramatically
a simple story.
