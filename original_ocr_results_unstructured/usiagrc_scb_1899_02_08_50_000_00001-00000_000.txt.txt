George Washington Cable.

On Friday night Mr. Cahle. the
well-known novelist and lecturer.
will give a dramatic rendition of
“Bonaventure.” This, perhaps. is
one of his most charming stories.
in artistic beauty; in an exuber»
ant, sympathetic lnrnr,rn life; in a
rare quality of humor and pathos,
this story has few equals in ntnd-
ernrday literature. Mr. Gilder.
editor of the leI/Vy [Wtzgazz/rz',
hits this to say til Mr. Crble:

"Then: is one name it is otilt
necessary to repeat, in order to
suggest a ithole lttt'rature by it
selt wellnigh uiitxampled rtr its
novelty and chartl‘lilltat of Geo.
W. Cable. When we think of the
originality of theme and scene in
‘Botiaventure,’ the delicate and
constant humor, the range and den
velopment of character subtly
portrayed, the vivid setting of
landscape and manifest delight in
nature—when we think of the
spontaneity and ease of style the
dramatic force, the pervading
of beauty, and the solid
moral basis of the \vlloleiwltcn
we think of all these qualities, it
is rash to ask whether since Haw-
thorne, American ﬁction can boast
a truer work of art?"

In addition to “Bonaventure,”
Mt. Cable has consented to sing a
number of his Creole Folk songs,
which it is said by those having
heard them. are exceptionally
wellrrendeted, it is liopedalarge
audience will be present to enjoy
an evening which cannot tail to
be a delightful one.

Mr. Cable was born in New Or»
leans in r344, and upon tlle outs
break of the ctvil war joined the
Fourth Mississippi cavalry, C. 5.
