(Continued from last issue.)

Alollg with the work which is being
carried on among the diiierellt lieids
ill America. none is of more interest
than the work being dolle among the
Soldiers and Sailors The government
has cooperated with the Association
where over possible There are 23 hr-
my Associations
the Naval

and 3 branches of
Association. These diiier-
olit branches employ .33 secretaries to
carry on the work.

The management alld e'diciont con-
trol oi all these iorces is ill itseli no
small problem. Fi s-t we have the
World's Committee and its secretaries.
This body is located at Geneva. Swit-
zerland and thus iar has chiefly com
ﬁlled its attention to the work on the
continent. It is a representative body
having representatives oi the Associ-
ations iroln all lands. This committee
is appointed by the World's Conier-
ence. The international Comlnittee is
the next great administrative body.
it is comprised of representative busi-
ness men trom the North American
Associations it has 75 secretaries in
America and 70 ill the ior ign held.
The objective oi the committee is. bet-
ter rnen tor the Associations; better
training;
better

more Adequate equipment;
organization and administra-
tion; stronger physical. broader edu-
cated. boys. We have
in addition to the general admin-tra-

a board of business. professional and

ation. Still further dowll ill the scale

oi organization we iilld the local coin—
mittee ill each Association looking ai-
tel- some interest oi that body. This
briel‘ summary oi the organization will
show to what a great c. out it has
been developed and centralized. The
eiliciency of the work done is a good
test oi the merit oi the system.

it has been noted bciore that a
large portion oi the attention oi the
World's Committee and the interns

most evenly. and closely contested and
the men ior the intercollegiate teams
have largely come iroln debaters who
have had this experience. As such is

Experience ,iluollg Colleges oi

The Friday Morning Cllnpel Services
were conducted by Dr. \Villiams of
Chicago, who has been lecturing to
Dr. Steiner's classes during this past
week. Dr. Vi’lllinnls made an excellent
itddr 5 upon the opportunities of the
College Student in the VVeSt. He
spoke from a wide experience among
colleges of the middle and far West
and thus his address has a peculiar
interest.

"The opportunities here offered are
yours. The Present is yours, the Fu-
ture is yours. I need not exhoﬂ. you
to be equal to your opportunity. Waste
not your time. If work is hard. work
harder and rejoice in your Work.
Don't look tor a place where it will
be easy. where you‘cau slip along
Without much effort. but look {or a
place requiring Wisdom and tact. in»
tellectual strength and bodily power.
And above all. don't lose sight Of the
moral and Spiritual side of yourself.
For after 311, character is a man’s‘
most. valuable asset; and no character
is strong. nor can be strong which
loses sight of God and the ideals of
the Gospel of Christ."
