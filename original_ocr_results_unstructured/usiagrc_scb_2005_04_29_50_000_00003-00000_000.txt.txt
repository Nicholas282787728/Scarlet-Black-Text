E ‘Stomping out the bugs

Information Technology Services (ITS) installs new spam filter and enacts
new password requirements to make computers more secure

Bv MAC POHANKA
The past six months have seen a rise in hacking
at major universities and colleges, according to Bill
Francis, Director orlntormarion Technology services,
causing ITS to make changes to campus technology.
Francis said that growth in
the number of documents and the

tempt to make all campus technology more secure.
According to a letter Francis posted on the ITS wcbr
sire, lTs has also been updating hardware and sore
ware for servers and other major components of the
school network in addition to changing the password
policy.

The change in policy, origi—

amount of information protected
by our passwords necessitated a
change.

ITS decided a change was
necessary because the six-letter
passwords of the past 20 years
were long outdated and could be

nally considered last spring, took
ettect on April 7.

Initially, there were some
problems. some students using
email clients experienced prob-
lems because crautomaric sign in
and automatic mail checking sySr

cracked easily. New passwords are
required to be at least eight digits
long and must include both letters
and numbers. This way, according to Francis, pass—
words become more complex and difﬁcult to hack.

The passwords also expire after approximately 190
days, rather than once a year as they had previously.
Francis said that the new password policy would in-
crease security for studenr transcripts, emails and oth-
er important information protected under the campus
network.

tems. These mail clients did not
recognize the need for password
changes and after several login at
tempts the students accounts were locked out. Francis
said nearly all difﬁculties have subsided.

With this change to the password policy, ITS has
also added a spam ﬁltering server to the network. Be-
fore December the Grinnell College network had no
spam ﬁltering service, but now users have the option
of turning on a central filter.

“The spam ﬁlter is a convenience right now, but
eventually it will be a necessity,” said Francis. “Right

What happened wlym you attempted [0 pm?
I said I wanted to run for
city council, and in order to be
a candidate you have to regis-
ter to vote, and I attempted to
register as a member of the
National Guard in Virginia
and as someone who had
intended on living in Wil-
liamsburg indefinitely and
whose driver’s license was
Virginian.
A week later I got a letter
saying I'd be denied because
I’m claimed as a dependent
on my parent; taxes. Also while i was registering
I had to fill out a questionnaire that had not been
previously administered asking things that were very
student speciﬁc, Even things likc,“Wllerc do you go

I think ifyou look crosswulturally and from his-
torical perspectives, students have been feared and
are viewed ofsomething to be afraid ofby more es,
iablished members ofsocicty because young people
are the ones that are willing to engage and question
some of the existing structures. Look at Tianamen
Square or the 19605.

In my experience, opposirion has been that stir
dents are transient and have no vested interest in the
long-term community. Really that argument I think
is kind of absurd because the US Census Bureau
determined the 47% of Americans move every five
yearsTo penalize one group because they have some
kind of defined transicnce is antirdemocratic.

The main opposition is just fear ofstudcnt take
over, but ifyou look at examples of where students
have been granted the right to vote such as student
friendly states like Wisconsin and North Carolina,
that kind of fear hasn't materialized. ‘

How you beard about the Danny Carroll imie

There is certainly a point tor the townspeople to
argue when they see students voting based on swing
states. But at the end ofthe day, ifyou look at all the
arguments and weigh it all up, in states that allow
students to chose, students should chose to vote in
their college towns.

The reason being, just the amount of time we

pate in a democracy that has an affect on us only
eight weeks out or the year or does it make sense
to participate in the democracy that will have the
greatest impact on us over time? I would say it is
the latter.

Also, you are counted in the us. census as an

now, about two-thirds of the mail that comes into
Grinncll college is spam.”

Grinncll College receives about 30,000 messages
daily. and 10,000 of those are addressed to bogus ads
dresses or to people who are not hear. The new service
does not accept messages to non—existent email ad-
dresses.

Francis said that rlrc ﬁlter was not automatically
turned on for everyone. The filter can be set to difr
rerent levels, allowing varying types of email to be file
tered out. Francis directed those interested in setting
up a spam filter to the ITS website.

A related change is also undcr way with Web-
mail, the college's old email program. According to
Francis, every few years the email exchange program
is updated. However, no company owns or updates
Webmail anymore, making it incompatible with the
most recent exchange update in 2001. At that point,
in order to continue to use Webmail, ITS staff had to
alter the program.

Francis said that in July when the exchange is
updated again Webmail may be “unsalvageablc.” He
added that ITS is currently looking into different
email programs which may allow students to keep the
Webmail interface with updated capabilities and use
