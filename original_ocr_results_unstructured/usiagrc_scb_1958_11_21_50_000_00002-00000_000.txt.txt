Faculty Answers Quer

An 5&5 questionnaire was
this week placed in faculty boxA
es in an attempt to study pro-
fessorial attitudes toward various
areas of the curriculum and
class structure. Twenty-four foc-
ulty members responded.

Questions were directed at the
grading system. the course load,
grade distribution, homework
load, independent work and the
nature of the fourth-hour prol—
ect.

Adequate Grading System?
In answer to the first ques-

tion: “Is the present grading
system adequate? if not, what
alternative system would you
advocate?" the majority (17) ex-
pressed sslisfaction. with some
‘qualifying remarks. Seven com-
mended the recent addition of a
2.5 or C plus grade While one
feels that the “C plus Will not
resolve the supposed student
dilemma." Four others recom-
mended additional plus grades
within the present structure.

Among those answering
“yes". the following quali-
fying comments emerged:
“Grading systems are adequate
to the degree the grades rep-
resent valid measures of
achievemenL" Beryl E-
Wellborn (education). “Al-
most any grading system Is
adequate, ii the instructor
clearly defines his basis for
grades and applies the system
with mercy and sympathy for
poor students who work and
with discretion for tonstu-
den‘s." — Joseph Dr Danfortll

(chemistry).

“Students at Grinnell somer
times seem more concerned
about what grades they are
getting than what they are
learning. Students, who in high
school were at the top of their
class, now find themselves com-
peting for grades with others
who were in a similar position.
Someone “wins” hence the
frustrated good student. Comper
tition for grades becomes more
important to the student than
competing with himself to mas-
ter knowledge and skills con-
sistent with his objectives." 7
John M. Nelson (education),

“Any system currently being
used in higher education is cer-
tainly adequate. Obviously how
the system is used is far more
important than what the sys-
tem is.” — Thomas E. Lasswell
(sociology).

Among those finding the
system inadequate were Edith

A. sternfeld (art), Joseph
Dunner (political science) and
Leo J. Baranski (psychology).
Miss Sternfeld said that the
addition of the C plus grade
was an improvement upon the
past system. She went on to
say, however that “all grading
systems 7 whatever the sym-
bols used — are imperfect and,
at best, a sort of necessary evil
required for transcripts to grad.
uate schools, etc. If we could
just do away with all grading
systems, everyone would doubts
less be happier _ but that

present educational setup.”

Dunner also considers the
system inadequate, thinking
that the “entire grading sys-
tem of the colleges of the
United states ought to be res
vised." He finds the system
as it is practiced in this coun-
try "degrading." “Under the
grading system, the student is
forced to study for grades
rather than for integrated un-
derstnnding of the subject ma»
tcrial, I would like to see the
intmduction of comprehensive
examinations given once or
twice a year for any student
who feels that he has the
necessary ability to graduate.
This might come at the end
of two or three years of resi-
dcnce.

“lf sufficient colleges intms
duce this system, we will get
sufficient emphasis on integrat-
ed knowledge instead of highly
compartmentalized knowledge."

Earanski feels that "the pres»
ent system does not permit dis»
criminative grading.” He would
“favor either of the following
systems used at Wooster: A, A
minus, B plus, B, B minus . . . D
plus, D, D minus, r. Princeton:
1 plus, 1 l minus, 2 plus,‘ 2, 2
minus . . . 7."

Course Load

"How many courses do you
think a student can profitably
take at a given time?" drew an
almost unanimous response
with the majority of recommen»
dations falling within a four to
five-course. l5—17 credit hour

mold. Many emphasized the in—
dividual student and the courses
involved. The motivation of the
student also was stressed.

“The number should be de-
termined by ‘What am T able to
accomplish?‘ ‘What does this
course demand?’ ‘Da 1 want to
profit from this course or am I
a dabbler7’—Wellborn.

“Provided the work assign-
ments are reasonable, provided
the spirit of the college is
high mid most important pros
vided the student is motivated
-—I think 16 or 1': hours (five
courses) is a reasonable load."—
Baranski.

“If a student wishes to delve
into each subject in order to der‘
rive more than a superficial
knowledge of it, then 1 think
thnt four are a maximum."
Philip s. Thomas (economics
and business). lI

Lasswell: “Southern California.
has mostly tweeunit coursesl
most students carry seven or.
eight; Pomona has many five!
unit courses (Stanford has some
six-unit courses); students at
Poncna may take as few as
three courses."

Also mentioning courses
carrying lnrgcr credit units,
Grnnt o. Gale (physics) recs
ornrnends that "if the courses
ore to be broken up into
smaller and larger units mnny
science courses should carry
five credits as they do in other

colleges and universities."
James H. Stauss (economics
and business) recommends “four
(courses) in the freshman, jun»
ior and senior years, Perhaps
five may be appropriate in the
sophomore year. provided that
the introductory courses in der
partments (aside from the
courses usually taken by fresh.
men) and many of the required
courses (distributional and
others) are three—hour courses.
In this view, the sophomore
year is typically for the pur-
poses cf ‘sampling‘ fields, be-
ginning the maior field, and
meeting general and distribu—
tional requirements."
Grade Distribution
“in the normal class of so,
what would be your expected
grade distribution? ls it "cricket“
to give F‘s e to balance off
your curve?” To this, the third
question, nine faculty members
emphasized that they have no
expected distribution or use no
curve. Ten stressed the fact
that F’s are given infrequently
and never to balance off a curve.
With few exceptions, those
professors estimating their nor-
mal distribution made it clear
that this was the outcome of
observation of past classes, not
"fixed in advance," The con-
census was that “most students
get what they deserve." _ Ralph
E. Luebben (sociology).
Homework

A great majority of those poll»
ed responded, “Two hours per
class meeting" to the fourth
question: "How much homework
time per class meeting do you
expect students in 8 level, three
hour C level, 4 hour C level and l
4 hour D level courses to‘
spend?" The two hour estimate
was several times expanded to
three hours in the instances of
four hour courses.

A summarizatian of the re-
sponse may be found in the
statmnenl. of Thomas which
recommended “three hours per
week per credit hour" (l, e,)
for 3 hour nourses, this means
9 hours per week, 3 in class

and 6 hours out of class. For
43 courses, 3 hours outside of
class per class meeting.) “The,
‘average student’ will get an
‘all nvemge’ grade by putting
in n 48 hour academic work
week if he‘s carrying 16 hours
of credit." This time, he feels
should include writing papers
and studying for hour exams.
Luebben indicated that “two
hours for a frosh should be
quite different from two hours
for a junior or senior. Faculty
expectations do increase." Doro-
thy H022 (women’s physical ed-
ucation) stated that “the advance
nature of the course would sug—
gest, to some degree, the depth
of the investigation of the aca-
demic problems concerned."
Independent Work

Question live, “Do you Keel
that 2| 2.5 student is capable of
doing independent work? How
much?” met with 11 "yes" an5r
wers, one “no” and a number
of qualified statements.

Those in favor of independent
work for all included Evelyn
Gardner (English), Lasswell and
Nelson, Miss Gardner —— “One
‘independent study’ course with-
out Class meetings should be ex-
perienced by every student and
at least once in his career."
Lasswell — “Everyone is Capa-
ble of doing independent work.
We have mentél hospitals for
those who are not. at any rate.
Capacities of the human mech-
anism have not been fully
plumbed; We do know that all
living persons have stopped
short of full capacity. Nelson
— “I feel that any college slur

dent, so long as he is a college
student, is presumed competent
to do independent work.”

Miss Hoza sees, in the inde-
pendent progmm, a possible
antidote for loss of interest
in “things academic," saying
that “this type of creative
outlet might be just what is
needed to revitalize, stimulate,
or motivate students who have
the potential for doing better
work but have ‘lost interest'
temporarily in things aca-
demic.

Those questioning the ability
of the 2.5 student to do inde-
pendent work included Lueb-
bcn, Norman Goodbrod (music)
and John c. Truesdale (men's
physical education). Luebben —
‘This student might better spend
his time concentrating on regu-
Arly assigned work. I don't
think it’s a matter of capability
in some cases, but one of de-
sirability." Goodbrod — “I think
that a student who barely main-
tains a 2.5 has all he can han.
die.” Truesdale __ “Depends on
the student, the course. and the
motivation. ln courses that bring
him up to 2.5 _ yes; in courses
that bring him down — no.”

Fourth Hour rroiccts

Answers to the final ques-
tion “Do you favor the pro-
ject-centered or the integrated
fourth hour?" evoked comment
not only on the specific ques-
tion but upon the entire issue of

the desirability of the fourth
hour program,
