Way Back When

by Susan Roth

There are some things that never
change. When asked about how
Grinnell College has changed over
the past iew decades, Jane
Underhill, a Washingtonrarea
alumni representative. replies that
there are ”a lot oi procedural
changes" 7 there aren't as many
rules. and Kris have replaced
housemothers 7 but as (air as the
general character oi the school and
the students, it s surprisingly the
same

Underhill, who graduated irom
Grinnell in 1959. chose the school
ior many oi the same reasons as
applicants today, because it was a
small school highly rated
academically, with no iraternities
or sororities and “the sort oi peo
ple that i liked ” Then, just as now
there were students irom all
regions oi the United States and
irom several toreign countries,
And to ensure racial balance, the
college recruited
black students iincluding one who
isnow president or College Boardt
and Native Americans (largely
irom the Tama reservations).

As a student. Underhill oiiicially
majored in Spanish. but ireely ad-
mits. “Actually. i majored in jour-
nalism." She particularly
remembers the late Herbert
Prescott, a former prolessor oi
English and journalism, who, ac»
cording to Underhill. had more in
iluence on her iuture than anyone
else. Prescott was tirst Underhill‘s
ireshman English protessor (core

Student liie, according to
Underhlll. did have its similarities
to as well as differences from life
on campus at present, The most
distinct difference was the separa-
tion oi males and iemales by Cams
pus, with all men on North Campus
and all women on South. Within
that system. the major diiierence
between living arrangements ior
men and women was that the
men's residence halls. according
to Underhill, served the purpose of
iraternities, even having identiiy-
ing jackets and pins, and that men
lived in the same hall all {our
years. while the women tended to
move around more. with Main Hall
serving as a freshman dorm.
These living arrangements. in
turn, made Such activities as in-

Beyond these differencesv
however, the college made eiiorts
to bring movies and cultural ac-
tivities to campus much as it does
now. Underhill remembers not our
ly the lormaily organized ac-
tivities, but also the more informal
ones such as hanging out in Cowles
lounge listening to fellow student
Herbie Hancock play the piano.

The best thing about Grinnell,
though, according to Underhill,
was the people, who to her were
very individual and diverse. Says
Underhill, “There was a very in-
teresting and cosmopolitan group
oi people, and each one seemed
outstanding in his or her own
way."

Costa Rican Silhouettes

by Todd Francis:

We'd just crossed the border into
Nogales e a sleepy town at eight in
the morning on the home side, but
already wide awake in Mexico.
The local bus took us to the other
end oi the town , a huge, dirty,
empty train station. It looked dirr
ty, at least, to us, The bathrooms
were iilthy. and we iound no toilet
paper, no toilet seats. And more
good news: a six~hour wait ior our
train to Guadalajara, So we sat out
by the tracks and watched,

Along comes a man begging ior
money ior coffee. In English We
shake our heads “no.

He doesn't leave. in broken but
understandable English he ex-
plains that the 500 pesos he wants
is less than a quarter. 1 calculate
quickly and iind he‘s right, and
agree with him sothat l'm not
totally ignoring him,

He's grinning, as he has been
since he arrived, It's the kind of
grin that looks like it never really
leaves. His hair is black, Curly,
random. One side is scattered with
green paint.

“My name is Daniel,” says the
grin. “Like Daniel in the Bible."

I nod and ask him in Spanish
where he lives. He tells me in
English that he used to live in L,A..
but at in he got sent back to Mexico
because he neglected to fill out
some immigration document.

I ask him in Spanish about his
iamily, in English, again, he tells
me that his mother lives in a small
town south oi Guadalajara. His
sister lives in L.A., and with a very
shaky hand he writes her address
ior me. Then in the same barely
legible cursive he writes “Daniel
Ojeda Teran, 34540 PL L.A.C ”

l begin to wonder ii he speaks
Spanish.

He tells me about his brother.
israel, who lives in the same town
as his mother. lsrael, the same as
the nation in the Bible, And he has
a brother in the sky, too, he adds.
Jesus Christ, he names the brother
after a moment. I feel an impen-
ding speech on religion and want to
end the conversation But i can't
tell him to leave. and we‘re not

Not only would it be rude, but he
could follow us anywhere in the na-

‘ tion.

He grins at me. Daniel. he tells
me, was a man who survived for
days in a den oi lions With prompr
ting, the story even comes out in
Spanish, 1 iigure he's given up on
the coiiec. i wonder about giving
money. The value at a quarter is so
little m a dollar or two at home is
easily thrown away aiter the most
useless object. Is it egotism'?
ethnocentrism'.’ downright
selfishness?

l glance again at the grin, and he
pulls out a banana peel. “This is
my food." he tells me. But I don't
get the impression that he's doing
it to try to solicit pity or money.
Just matter of fact, as if he expects
me to pull a banana peel out oi my
pocket and start to chew on it. too,
I'm almost airaid he‘ll offer me a
bit of it,

i decide not to give him any
money. it won't solve any problem,
It might bring him back ior more.
it might attract other beggars, it
might not be good to get a wallet
out in the middle oi Mexmo when
it's not necessary. 1 justiiy my
decision by thinking that helping
people through teaching is more
valuable than trying to help by giv-
ing money. i smile back at the
banana peel and nod slightly,

Soon he wanders over to the side
or the loading dock ior the trains
where a tour-toot drop leads to the
tracks. His arms wobble as he
lowers himself carefully over the
edge, and i realize that here

Studying tor a semester in Costa
Rica can be a great way to get
away irom the bad weather in
lowa or to learn in an entirely new
environment. This tiny Central
American country lies between the
Tropics oi Cancer and Capricorn,
the region known as the “the
tropics " The year round warm
climate in San Jose allows a
classroom that opens directly to
the outdoors, and warm clothing is
unnecessary except on hikes to the
higher volcanos. Because Costa
Rica lies in the tropics. the sun
rises every day at about six in the
morning, and sets at about six in
the evening. Bedtime in San Jose is
generally much earlier than in
Grinnell 7 10 or 11 at night is con-
sidered late, since most people get
up between five and six, and ACM

area of. natural sciences, these
seminars cover such topics as

reforestation, and the issue of

These classes run throughout the
month of February. the first month

During March and April,
students travel to their research
sites and conduct their projects.
The kiiid of work involved can
range from digging for artifacts to

night to interviewing dairy
farmers about their business.

During a two-week break in the
middle oi the twomonth period,
students reunite in San Jose to
discuss the progress oi their pro~

pleted, students return to San Jose
in May to evaluate their resi-its,
