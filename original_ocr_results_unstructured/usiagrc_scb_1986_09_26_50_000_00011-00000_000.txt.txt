VB Needs Mental Lift

By Bob Litton

“It’s just a matter oi time before things
click together," says sophomore car
captain Jessica “Sammy” Toft. This op»
timistic assessment of the young season
comes after the volleyball team lost three
tough matches last week. '

Although playing their best volleyball as
a team, the lady netters had to settle for a
loss. After dropping three out of tour
games to a strong Marycrest squad, Grin-
nell fell to both Knox and Eureka at the
tournament last Saturday. While they
came up empty in the win column, the
players were proud because they played
well.

Therloss to Knox was an important one
because they are in our division At the

same time, however, the team can’t hold
their heads low because their minds were
deﬁnitely in the game, This increase in
concentration is a critical part of the net-
ters' season According to Tort, “We‘re a
young team with a lot of potential, and we
just need to work on 'he mental aspect of
the game,"

Wednesday, the women gave up a tough
home match against defending conference
champs Coe, 15-5. 15-4, 1570. Once again,
lack of mental preparation played a key
role in the loss.

The Pioneers host illinois College

invitational all day tomorrow, Team

Gridders Hope for Reign

By Wait Maley

in a rare occurrence Saturday, the
Pioneer football game was canceled due to
weather. A severe siorm (if you didn’t
notice) passed through the area thatmorn~
ing and caused the cancellation. The storm
had poor timing, to say the least, as it was
parent's weekend and many players'
parent made long trips to see their sons
play, The reason [or the cancellation was
that the field was dangerous to play on.
This is a new one on me, but I'm sure that
the decision was made With the player’s
welfare in mind, Many players expressed
their disappointment with the decision.
Some felt the decision should have been
delayed at least until game time, The
game was called at approximately 11:30
am, At game time it was bright and sunny,

a good day to play; unfortunately the
game had long since been called. Rumor
has it that Concordia will attempt to obtain
a lorleit from the situation, but nothing has
been confirmed as of now,

One fact that I accidentally left out of
last week’s article that deserves mention
is Rob Lowe’s three touchdowns. I don’t
know how this happened but the Scarlet
and Black and myself regret the error.

This week the Pioneers face Lake Forest
(hopefully) in their first conterence battle,
Assuming there is a Safe field to play on,
Lake Forest is led by John Jahn, a mam-
moth tackle who reportedly is getting
looks from pro scouts, The Pioneers once
again will be trying to continue their Winn-
ing ways, four victories in a row.

The game is slated to start at 1:30 on
Rosenbloom Field.

, Race

to Victory _

By Justin Lincoln

Grinnell made an excellent showing at
the conference’s Southern Division Cham-
pionships last weekend at Knox College in
Illinois, with the women and men both cap»
turing division titles

Despite the soggy course, the women
(Orbettes) successfully defended their
championship status. Jennifer Bishop pac-
ed her teammates as well as her op-
ponents, and won the threermile race with
an 13:53 clocking After battling an am-
biguous course, shavaun Adams ran away
with 4th place in 20:35. Dorothy shearn
followed closely and finished 7th place
overall in 20:47, Coach Evelyn Freeman
was extremely pleased with the race and is
hoping tor an encore performance at
tomorrow’s Les Duke invitational. This
Grinnell hosted meet is among the most
competitive of the season, sporting 12
teams, including many nonvconferelice
powerhouses. Freeman is particularly ex-
pecting intense competition from Simpson
College.

The men also returned home with a divi-
sion championship, with the Grinnell ”A"
team finishing first of the nine official
teams. in a demonstration of depth, the
Grinnell “B” and “C" teams unofiicially
finished «1th and 5th. respectively, overall.

The “A" team was led not by M1‘.T.,hut
by Greg Evans Completing Grinnell‘s
scoring were Steve Harrold, Kent Kath,
Steve Pieper, and Dave Wisdom. Though

Knox College placed within nine points of
Grinnell teamwise, Coach Freeman notes
that the numbers are misleading. Pioneer
runners from the “B" and “C" teams
finished belore some Knox scorers, but did
not figure into the scoring.

Freeman contends that the race still was
”nothing spectacular", and that the team
needs to improve its packrrunning techni-
ques. ”Again, our runners got strung out
over small intervals,” he said,

in working on the packing aspect in
tomorrow's race, Freeman says the team
goal is to keep all scorers together for the
initial three miles before allowing them to
split oif

Tomorrow's race will provide the men
with some tough competitors, too. in addi-
tion to Wartburg, a team which beat the
Pioneers earlier in the season, Grinnell
will be facing Simpson. Freeman says,
"We have the potential to linish Certainly
in the top a. and maybe even to win.” Grin-
nell finished 4th last year

The Les Duke Invitational tomorrow is a
‘target’ meet for both squds Will Freeman
describes a target meet as “one that we
change our training for so that rest before
a race becomes a focus," adding that men
tal preparation is more strongly emphasiz»
ed as well. The men have dedicated this
season to the late Les Duke, past Grinnell
coach and athletic director.

The races begin at 11:00 tomorrow mor-
ning, on the golf course north of campus,
and will be the iinal home meet [or the har»
