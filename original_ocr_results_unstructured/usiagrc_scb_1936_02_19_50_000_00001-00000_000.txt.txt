Play Author
to Attend
Rehearsals

Davidson to Revise Play,
‘No Women Wanted’
Next Week

William F. Davidson. author of
the play, “No Women Wanted,"
hopes to reach Crinneli this week-
end tooatteiid rehearsals and to
re-write certain parts of his play.
Because of show, which made highr
ways impassable, he was unable
to come last week as he had in-
tended, Mrs, Sara Sherman Pryor
said yesterday.

“The date of presentation is not
definite," Maurice Birdsall, who is
assisting Mrs. Pryor, drama head,
in the direction, stated yesterday.
"We have to wait until Mr. David
son arrives before we can make
filial plans, and we do not yet
know exactly when the play will
be in shape for presentation,”

The scene of the play is laid in a
woodsman's cabin on an island in
Lake Superior. An airplane, con-
taining a troupe of show girls and
actors, is forced down near the
cabin, The occupatns of the strand-
ed plane ask for shelter in the
cabin, and the men living in the
isolated home take them in, but
reluctantly, because they dislike
all women in general. However,
thc men fall in love with the won»
on, with unusual results.

The complete cast is Angus Mar
Dowell, owner of the cabiniJack
Spies ’39: Allard Anthony, his
bi-other-in-iaw—Leroy Moore '36:
Jimmy Anthony, his surliVal
Luck '39; Pat Jones, curator in a

way '37.

day to Grinnell to assist Mrs, Pry~
or in the direction, and to work
on play writing.

“Bauer Has Suffered
No Relapse”~Truesdall

“There is a mistaken bclicf thatl
Julius Bauer suffered a relapse as
a result of being allowed to play in
the last couple of games," Conch
John C Ti Hesdftla said in an inter- .
\‘lé'vv yesteidoy. “but the facts are!
the‘
advice of the doctor in an attempt
to stimulate his recovery from alll

.attack of chronic appendicitis"

klr. Tl‘uesdalc's statement comes. ‘
as a result of rumors that the
Crinnell carcaptain and star cenr
tcr should not have been playing,v
and that he has suffered a relapse
an a result of having done so. i

“No athlete at Gi-inneil college
will ever bc allowed to play when,
there is any doubt in the doctor's;
mind as to whether or not he is in!
shape to play," Truesdale further!
stated. i
Dr. John Parish, Bauer’s physl-i
cian, reiterated Truesdale's stater.
merit, and explained, "The reason
‘Julle' is out of the game again is
that his condition did not improve,
and he’s still under par."

The physician further stated
that Mr. Truesdale was in "close
cooperation" with him at all times, I
and that Bauer was under constant
observation while playing "His
playing was more of a test to see
how he would react, and he was
under constant observation,” Dr.

Cagers to {Play ‘
in St. Louis

Will Meet Bears Friday;
Billikans on Saturday

By Jim Bradley
The Grinnell Pioneers who did
their part to make the current Mis-

souri Valley conference basketball _

race a maniacal scramble last
Friday, will seek to make it even
more so when they take a two—day
road trip to St. Louis this week-
end. They will meet Washington
on Friday night, and st. Louis unir
versity on Saturday.

The retum engagement with the
Bears is a conference tilt and will,
in all probability, decide who will
have tho dubious honor of finish
ing the race in the cellar. The
Bears, at present, hold that posi~
tion, as the result of a late season
staleness, which has resulted in a
number of defeats by other confer-
ence foes.

To Decide Cellar Position

Should the Bears win, then both
teams will be tied for Lhe cellar
with three wins and six defeats.
However, if the Gnnnellians suc-
ceed in downing the Washington
team, they will be within a game
of fifth place, with a return match
yet to be played with the Tulsa
Hurricanes, present holders of that
position,

Grinnell will be seeking revenge
for the 384M overtime defeat
which the Bears handed them here
earlier in the season. The Pioneers

bsll coach here to fill the place
made vacant by the resignation of
Mr. L. L. “Fuzz” Watt.

“Mr. Baker was not offered the

“The misunderstanding probably
arose from the fact that he was

‘iiiterviewcd along with several oth-

er candidates who have been men-
tioned for the coaching position,
This, however, was not an offer of
any kind, and Mr, Baker certainly
was mistaken," he explained.

No Definite Action

No definite action has been take
on to fill the present vacancy other
than that a number of candidates
for the position are being inter-
viewed, Mr. Nollen explained when
question as to developments in re-
gard to the scleotion of a successor
to Watt.

“Wt are simply flooded with ap-
pllcztions for the positions, with
every coach from Maine to Cali-

seeming to send in applica-

We are interviewing as
many men as possible and will
seek to make an appointment as
soon as possible,” he said.

President Nollen also revealed
that‘ no definite announcement
would be made by any individual
member of the administration or of
the facility committee on athlet-
ics “The announcement will be
made by the committee as a
Whole.“ he asserted.

letics is composed of Mr, Earl D.
Strong, chairman; Mr. J. C. Trues-
dale, Mr. Grant 0. Gale, Mr. Psiil
