52 Delinquen’rs
ln Condiﬁoning

Men Will Be Placed
On Current Condition;
Musl‘ Pay One Dollar

There are 52 delinquents in the
conditioning classes at the end
of this month, John c Trucsdale
said yesterday. These men are
now on ‘clll‘rent CDHdltlon' and
must pay $1 for the right to
make up the missed periods. If
any others fall behind during the
coming month, they will also hero
to pay $1. ,

This monthly checkup is caused
by war conditions, he said. Month-
Iy grades are given to each stu-
dent in order that his college
credits may be accurately deter-
mined in case he is called into
service A "current condition" in
condi oning will nullify all the
student’s credits in the semester
just the some as a ‘current con-
dition’ in any other subject.

In contrast to last year there
will be no speedy means of mak-
ing up conditioning at the end of
the semester, but sixty hour-long
conditioning periods must be at
tended during the semester.

The following men are current-
ly delinquent: Baker, Barber,
Bremicker, lEmmert. .Eiel, Fro-
hardt, Funk, Gooley, Hitt, armo-
ing. Kenyon, Kolp, d... Krause,

snow, and miserahle spectators,
Grinnell scored first, but failed
to convert, starting the “extra
point" hugaboo which was to
haunt the Pioneers all season and
cost Grinnell two other games.
Monmouth scored, made the extra
point, and there the game rested,
no further scores being made on
the slippery field.

DRAKE—-

Next week the team traveled
to Des Moines to engage the Bullr
dogs in the fiftieth football can-
test between the two. Waters
snagged a pass for 6 points, but
no seventh was forthcoming, The
Pioneers outbattled Drake futile
ly as Drake managed to get a
touchdown and convert. It was
the biggest scare Drake had get-
ten from Crime! in 10 years.
KNOX—

The Pioneers disgusted now,
traveled to Galesburg but were
still unable to register a will.
The heavier Knox team beat us
13—7 as McGrane almost hit his
tongue off when he was tackled
at the start of the game.
BEAHAWKS—

Newton was the scene of the
next encounter, and the game

dedicated Newton's new stadium. ’

Our opponents were the powerful
Beahawks whose captain and cam
ter was Art Werlein, a former
Grinnell player. The rampaging
Beahawks scored first but we
soon reteiiated when Waters re-
turned a punt to the Beahawks'
20 and ran around end on the
next play for a touchdown It
wasn't long hefore Grinnell struck
again as Brunie vanstrum, seeing
his first full game snagged a
long pass and can 20 yd. for a

touchdown. We failed to make
the point after. In the second
half the driving Beahcwks finale
ly crashed through for another
touchdown and made the point,
for the ball game. Gn'lmell play-
ed an excellent game even though
it was the loser.
CORNELL—

oii Homecoming day. Griiincll
had still to record a victory, hav-
ing lost three of their first four
by one point. It looked like the
same old story nhen the score
stood 7’s dg'dlllst Grinnell at the
half. However Tod Kcnnetick

a pass on the dead run and

stumbled past the Cornell man

Gl'inell 12, Cornell 7.

COE—

With a spirit of victory instill-
ed, the Pioneers took coe next
week 1376. After Coe had tied
it up all six in the third quarter.

"Curly" Bishop intercepted a

mPON—

In the final game Grinnell ran
wild over Ripon. With a narrow
margin of 7-3 at the end of the
first quarter Grinnell started to
roll. McGrane returned the kick-
off follwing the Rlpon tally fora
score, It was not long before
Waters rambled through for one
other touchdown. Thereafter
Grinnell coasted to a 50—25 vic—
tory. Thus the 1942 footfall sea»
son ended with a bank and our
closing drive on three straight
victories did much to make up for
three 1 point setbacks. It was
an especially happy occasion for
seniors who were playing their
last games.
