Beat Langan A. B, Teams
in Second Round

Rawson hall cagers opened the
second round of the intramural
basketball race this morning by
handing the Larigair teams a
double defeat, as the Raw-son A’s
won 13-9, and the 8's easily won
1H.

The A gariie was a steady hut
dull game as the Rawson team
maintained a safe lead throughout
the entire conflict. Harvey
Kelly for-ward. paced his team in
scoring with tive points, garnered
on two field goals and one free
throw. For Langao. Moehl, a
guard, was the leading scorer.
getting tour poihts on two field
goals.

In the B contest, the Rawsoii
teani proved far too powerful for
the hapless Langan aggregation.
and the Kelly men had no trouble
inpiling up a large margin of
victory. Holstad, forward for
Rawson lead his team in scoring
with six points. all gained on
field goals. Claude McAlpm.
Langan gu led his team’s
offensive with four points, like»
wise garnered via the field goal
route.

known advantage of playing on
their home floor may prove to be
the deciding margin in the coming
tilt.
Drake Powerlul

Drake is every bit as good as
Creighton in the opinion of Coach
Trucsdale, but he hopes to have
his charges in hetter shape than
they were for the disastrous
Omaha game. The Bulldogs. like
the Bluejays, have two speedy for--
wards, who with the aid of Chuck
Orchaugh, perennial Drake star.
make up the efficient Bulldog scor.
ing machine. Truesdale is not yet
ready to admit that the Pioneers
haven't a chance for the confer-
ence crown. “The team is improv-
ing with each game. and the seat»
son should he very‘intel‘esting," he
said Friday.

If Fred Luther is able to rejoin
the squad early in February. as is
now expected, Gl‘innell's chances
of finishing fairly high in the val-
ley flag chase will appear much
better, Trucsdale believes.

Cagers Drop Loop Till
to Bluejays, 51—28

Lack of organization and team
play caused the downfall of the
Pioneer cage team again Wednese
day as a fast, powerful Creighton
outfit outscored them by a 51-28
score at Omaha. The halt-time
score was 2579 in favor of the
Bluejays.

Creighton, using a fast hreak
with Shaw as its spearhead, got
off to a rast start. and the Pio-
neers, instead of slowing the game
down and cooling them off. tried
to match the Bluejay's speed. As
a consequence. Shaw dropped in
eight baskets in the first half.
while his teammates contributed
nine more points.

The Pioneers started a short
rally early in the second period.
which netted them 10 points to
Cl'eighton’s two. and brought the
score to 2749. but the Jays turned
on the heat again, and went
ahead to pile up their 23-point
lead.

Shaw. with his 23 points, was
outstanding for Creighton, while
Ron also managed to drop in 12
points. For Crinnell. Luick was
high with nine points. with La—
Masney and Hayward each get-
ting five. Cornish, reserve cen-
ter. played excellent hall during
the time he was in the game.
