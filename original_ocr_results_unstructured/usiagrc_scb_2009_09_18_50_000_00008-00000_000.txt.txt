Binary House

BY Max CALENBERG

After spending their ﬁrst year mostly together in
Younker and a second year all together on East campus,
Jacob Reisberg ’10, Damian von Schoenborn ’10. Ben
Zarov ’10, Kelsey Picken '10, Carlos Lu '10 and Nathan
Levine'lU have moved their closcrknitgroup even closer
into 1010 High Street, or, as it's more affectionately
referred to, Binary House.

The pcargrcen colored house is comfortable inside—
thc bedrooms are large and one even has chalkboaids for
walls. The attic is a decidedly creepy room of discarded
furniture, including two beds covered with garbage,
a cradle and a miniature armchair, The strong7 smell
and low ceilings of the basement kccp residents from
spending too much time below, Outside seems to be
where the housemates have put most ottherr energy—
they rotoetilled their backyard and created a garden.

The farming is mostly the homegrown vegetable
or Reisberg, who has earned the nickname Farmer Jae
fiom his ioommates. He seems to deserve itia zucchini
the lee of Shaq‘s forearm sits in tho windowsili waiting
to be eaten. Reisberg is happy to pmvidc and cook for
his friends, seeing them as a community. “All six otns
have been close all four years, we are very family-like,"
Reishcrg said, “We have sit down dinners where we all
eat together."

The Binary boys—plus l’ickeitiwould like to
extend this commrmity past their walls to the entire
campus. Sharing the sentiments orShambalot residents,
they want to return a feeling ofwclcoming they feel as
been absent for some time now. “We reel it's a duty or
the seniors," Lu said. “Especially on High Street which
had that culture our freshman year to provide a 'cool
place to always go—tor anybody"

So feel free to come visit Binary house, where you’re
welcome to imbibe, hang out on the couch and play
Halo or Super Smash Brothersithc N64 version, of
course. Just pleasbleavc the food tor those who live
there.

Shambalot

BYMAXCALENBERG

1003 High street is in shambles, the people leaving
it on weekend nights are usually in shambles and zac
Ellington '10, Ross Preston ’10, Alysia Vallas ’10, Chloe
Moryl '10, who serves as Editor—ianhief for 7716
deals, and Jerome Simmons ’10 are so proud of these
conditions they‘ve dubbed their lSOryerlrrold abodc
“Shambalot.”

Although .111 very close, the bunch is less traditional
than their neighbors in Binary house when it comes to
meals. “We do :1 lot of communal snacking, but we ale
all so busy it's hard to do sit down dinneis,"Vallas said.

The Sliainbalot residents endorse the concept of
bringing a welcoming and fun vibe back to High Street
and they have already started the processtast weekend
was the ﬁist one in like month that we haven't gotten a
keg at least one weekend niglit,"said Ellington.

They have also proposed a High street progressive
party that would move between roughly six or seven
houses throughout the night, much like students pass
from room to room in their dorms. Every house has
a part or it that just draws people to gather there and
socialize, and for Shambalot, it‘s easily the front porch,
which has an assortment ofcomfortablc chairs lined up.

“At any given time you can come out to the porch
and there we will be people chilling out here and doing
homework," Vallas said. “I spent my summer there,”
Ellington said.

In addition to the humans, 1008 High Street is
home to a—most likely femalciduckling named
scooter who Vallas bought for a 51.50 on way to school
this year. House training is a bit ofan obstacle. “You can
feel it start to wiggle and then you know it’s time, so
you bring it to its pen" said Vallas, “or sometimes you
underestimate the wiggle time and get it all over you."

so come to 1008 High Street, if you want to feel
welcome and see a duck roaming aroundijust don’t be
afraid to leave 'in shambles,

The duplex on 1002 High street surprisingly looks
nothing like a house accommodating college studentsi
there is a conspicuous lack ofbeer bottles. red solo cups
and half-broken bikes on its front lawn. Instead, the pleas-
ant glow orwarm lights from the kitchen draws you into
the house where Virginia Andersen '10, Emily Roberts
’10 and Hanna von Schlegell’lO, are all grouped around
a table in the kitchen, casually chatting and munching
on salsa and dip.

The three knew they wanted to live together since
last year’lhey rner dnrrng their ﬁrst and second years at
Grinnell, but have not had a Chance to live together until
now due to conﬂicting study abroad schedules.“1t’s nice
to all be togetltcr,"}\ndcrscn said.

They have not completely ﬁnished moving iniin fact,
there is still a mattress leaning against a wall in the living
room,“\’\7e were trying to get the mattress down the starrs
and box spring got stuck under the railing," Roberts said.
“We were stuck under it for almost 45 minutes!"

Other house lrrlditionsithosc other than being stuck
under mattresscsiinclude baking. “1 procrastinate by
bakrng,"von Schlegcll said. “Late at night, there's always
going to be something fresh." von schlegells other
culinary achievements include pelfecting the making
of homemade lCCTCICan thanks to her iCC’Crc’lm maker.

Life is not all sweet at 1002 High street—the girls
agree that paying bills and rent have a “grounding circct"
upon them. “Heat and electricity, my godl’von schlegell
said. Despite the burden of responsibilities like these,
however, all agree that the amenities of having their
own rooms, two bathrooms and a nice living space are
deﬁnitely wolth it. “It feels more like home," Roberts said.
