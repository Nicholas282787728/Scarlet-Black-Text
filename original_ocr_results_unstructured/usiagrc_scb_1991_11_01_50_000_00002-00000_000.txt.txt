Since 1986, the town of
Grinnell has been one of the
600 small communities in-
volved in the national Main
Street program. Funded by
the small towns, Main Street
works to revitalize the down—
towns of the communities.

Erin Duggan, a Grinnell
student involved with Main
Street, explained that revi-
talization efforts are aimed at
helping businesses.

"Too often, nowadays,
people say, ‘Let’s just drive
seventy miles to the mall,m said
Duggan. Main Street makes people
feel pan of a community again so that
people will do their shopping locally.
Main Street does this by sponsoring
promotional programs such as Happy
Days, and A Taste of Christmas.

Duggan summed up Main Street’s
aim by explaining that Main Street
tries to make downtown the “living
room" of Grinnell.

Karen Baxter, Main Street project
manager, explained that a downtown
is the “heart and soul of the commu-
nity.” A sense of town pride is impor-
tant, she said, because losing a town
center brings economic problems.

businesses to preserve the original are

Although the big malls today have
many advantages over small busi-
nesses. Baxter explained, they do not
havehistorical store fronts. Main Street
succeeded in getting the downtown of
Grinnell listed on the National Regis-
ter of historic places.

Main Street also strengthens the
downtown economy by recruiting
businesses. Surveys are taken to dis-
cover what customers want, and new

businesses are recruited accordingly.

Duggan and fellow student Chris
Doemel collaborate wtth Main Street
on a newsletter distributed to Grinnell
businesses. Their newsletter includes
articles about recentrenovations, ways
to improve customer service and tips
on preparing window displays.

Last June, Duggan and Doemel
received a Govemor‘s Award for best
newsletter in a state-wide competition
between Main Street communities

Iowa: Land of leaders,
dissenters and fruit trees

By Julie Gard

King OlafV of Norway has visited
Iowa seven times, big band leader
Glenn Miller grew up in awhitehouse
in Clarinda, and the first Delicious
apple tree in the world bore fruit in
Madison County. Loren Horton pre-
sented these and other “Highlights of
Iowa History” during arecent Mortar
Board Coffee Hour.

While he “didn't want to say ec-
centricities," Horton did discuss the
“individualistic natureoflowans.”The
only Iowan on the Supreme Court had
the second highest number of dissent—
ing opinions iii the court’s ltistory,

Iowans also have a penchant for
monuments, he said. Horton cited the
many“boulderswtthplaqucsonthem,
commemorating very important thi ngs
in Iowa history."Theoldest memorial
marks the burying place of Sergeartt
Charles Floyd, a member of the Lewis
andClarkexpedittonwhodiedinIowa.
Horton said, “They [those Iowans]
managed to find some bones down-
stream and thought they were his and
buried them.“

Other notable Iowans include
Herbert Hoover and his wife; Merle
Hay (of Des Moines shopping mall

fame). the first Iowa soldier to die in
World WarI;SamuelFreeman Miller;
and Grenville Mellon Dodge,

Many of Iowa‘s assets have nothv
ing to do with Iowans, but involve
geographical features. Horton admire
ted that “Iowa has more than its share
of grade A topsoil." In addition, “fine
soil with the texture ofialcum powder
left from the melting of the glaciers”
can be found only here and in China.
Distinguishing it from all other states,
Iowa is the only one with two major
rivers as boundaries.

Although “no one lived in them
long [because they were] uncomfortr
able,” there are “lots of log cabins in
Iowa‘s history,“ stated Horton. One is
a restored, uniquely “lireplaceless"
structure located in northwest Iowa.
Its inhabitants were killed by Sioux
Indians in 1856. (The head ofa Sioux
Indian hung on the cabin door of a
victim’s brother.)

Mrs. Hoover’s home now rests under

course.“ Horton added, “movies are
made in Iowa.“
