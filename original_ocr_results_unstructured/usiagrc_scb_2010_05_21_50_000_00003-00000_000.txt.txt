Live life on the Wilder side

‘Den of debauchery' provides firm foundation

Asa Wilder '10 remembers the years
before the smoking ban in Grinnell, when
he was a ﬁrst year and sophomore. Those
two years he spent as part orrbe Cleveland
family were some of the most important
memories for him.

“I remember there
being legends of what
Cleveland was like,”
Wilder said, referring to
the nanight study binges
and the smokeeﬂlled
halls the nights before
big papers or assignments were due.“1twas
a regular den ofdebauchery.”

Amidst the ashy lounges and coffee
stains, Wilder started friendships with
upperelassrnen such as Connor savage '08
and Evan Ferrier ’085 and was eventually
declared the little brother of the group,

“They made me feel like 1 was a part of

Asa Wilder
y Mando Montana ‘

something, and we were all there for each
other lfsomething happened."

In his four years M Grinnell, he starred
a rap group his ﬁrst year ealled “Honor
Gs" with other Clevelanders, hosted his

own KDIC show and
l eventually became the
l musicdirecrorofKDIC.
l A group .nudslide on
‘ Cleveland beaeh after his
sophomore year marked
the end ofhis time living
on eampus.

“It was the end of an era," he said. "All
the people who played a role in my eollege
experience were leaving, so we celebrated
and threw mud at each other. It was a last
hurrah ofsorrs."

The Wilder legaey in Cleveland
eontinues, This ear, Wilder's younger
brother, Issae Wilder '13, name to the dorm

as a first year.

"It feels like a weird passing ofrhe torch,"
Asa Wilder said. “He has a really good group
offriends, and they're all learning the ropes
and testing the boundaries, which is exactly
what you're supposed to do as a firsreyear."

Even though Wilder lives off campus
and is graduating, he looks at his experience
as complete.

“I'm really happy with my time here,"
he said. “I feel like I’ve done it, and it feels
right."

After Wilder graduates on Monday
from Grinnell with a degree in philosophy,
he plans on taking time off from academia
in New York City to work in a coffee
shop or bookstore while living with other
Grinnelllans.

“I feel like if I have a support group
of Grinnellians, nothing too terrible can
happen." he said.
