A Black senior speaks out

lhave allowed almost three and
a halt years to go by without

making a sound, It burned during
the summers and time crept by

during the tails; it rained during
the springs and stormed during the
winters. All of this time has passed
by andl sometimes wonder lihal I
have to show for It Grinnell’s
enrollment continues to grow.
students Continue lheir liberal
rhetoric. and table conversations
range from the sublime to tho
absurd,

For the past iew years as a black
ioreigner in America. 1 hat-c ob-
served various aspects oi the
College scene devouring as many
partsot the “Gl‘lnnell Experience”
as possible. Now. in retrospect. I
wish to share ii few confusmg
realities that exist zimong the black
populous of the Crime” student
body. it is not my intention to
speak as a representative of the
black students on this campus. but
rather merely to exprc. niy
disgust inwards this social imr
broglio.

When I arrived at Grinnell three
and a half years ago, I thought my
biggest battle would be to survive
the Winter. Being from the

 

Bahamas. I was definitely not
accustomed to the Iowa \icather.

However, i was mistaken I look
back and see that my biggest battle
was one of maintaining my in-
dividuality among my ethnic
peers. The subtleties and candour
regarding interracial interactions
were surprising,

For three years, I observed a
latent territoriality ln Cowles
dining hall. Nearly eighty per cent
oi the black students ate in a
speciiic section oi the dining hall
Very few white students ever
dared to eat in that area. Similarly.
only a iew black students would
ever invite his~lier While friends to
eat with their ethnic peers in that
section Two triends would walk
into the dining hall together, but
atter receivnig their iood the
pageant would climax with the
white student eating in a diiierent
section. wlille the black student ate
in the “black section" with his
ethnic contemporaries These
iriends would then continue their
lriendship in less iormai settings

Occasionally there were
deviants When these “in-
dividuals” made an appearance, it
was met With bitterness or in-
diiierence litany types oi peer
pressure were ex d, both subtly
and overtly. If these methods did
not work, ostracisin was the iinal

 

instrument to induce conformity
Presently, the situation is not as
bad as it was three years ago.
However. the immediate question
in my mind is “whether blackness
is a matter at pigmentation, or a
dogmatic separatistic ideology?" I
am Cognizant that the issue of a
pure race has not been settled as
yet. However in my opinion the
race issue has been solved by a iew
black females al Grinnell. By their
definition a black male is a person
who does not incessantly interact
with white students, I believe this
definition is incorrect and may be
taken as an indication of racism.
In 1951. Arnold Rose made a
report to UNESCO in Paris which
was entitled The Roots of
Prejudice. Rose defines prejudice
also “set of attitudes which causes.
supports or justiiics
discrimination." I feel that many
situations have occurred recently
in which outright prejudice was
directed towards \VhitC students by
black students Hence my ac-
cusation that the organization of
”Concerned Black Students”
tCBSi is prejudice and works to
deprive many oi its members oi
their individualily and an
unlimited Grinnell Experience.
About eight years ago CBS was

termed as an “empathetic sink“
ior black students At that time
blacks were experiencing hostility
and prejudice irom both college
students and townspeople. Now, I
think the times have changed and
diiierent tactics must be used to
ensure racial equality i also ieel
that it is a disaster that ones
membership in that organization
should be contingent on one’s lns
terracial interactions As a result
oi the above sentiments, i think
”real” relationships have been
ruined because oi ethnocentric
peer pressure,

On the other hand, l do not view
CBS as the only culprit oi this
prejudice Grinnell College is just
as‘much to blame in this ielony,
Since the College iinancially
subsidized this organization. i
think that they should be held
accountable ior CBS‘S activities
cos. too. should uphold the
College's “nondiscriminatory
policy,"

During the past weekend a black
student invited some white
students along with him to a party
that was held at the Black Cultural
Center. Aiter minutes at the party
the student was inlormcd that the
white students had to leave. The
explanation given was that “in

 

.§

the tCBS) constitution, whiir
students are allowed to visit the”
Center during specilic hours." The
belittled and embarrassed
black student iniormed the white
students oi the iniormation and
they leit as quietly as they came,

As a black student, I iind the
above occurence unnecessary and
unjustifiable. Constitutions and
organizations are created to serve
a purpose when that purpose is no
longer relevant. the upholding oi
those archaic practices should be
discontinued it not, the coir .
stitutions become pui-poseless ,and‘
the members oi such an
organization end up aimlessly
pursuing an illusion ior an ideal

The above incident may seem
paradoxical in view oi present‘
American news, On Sunday,
November 15. 1975. Presidentelect
Jimmy Carter's congregation
voted to allow blacks to join their
church in Plains. Georgia: con-
vcrsely, on Friday, November 12,
two, the Griiinell CBS upheld a
bylaw to bar white students irom
the Black Cultural Center.

A call for justice

To the Editor: I have always
thought oi Grinnell College as a
community oi persons who are
sensitive to social injustice and
committed to doing what can be
done to relieve it. There have been
times when Gl'innelllans not only
studied human problems but in-
volved themselves in solving them
In the 1890’s George D. Herron, the
iirst holder oi the Chair which this
writer now occupies. used his
proiessorial position to attack the
exploitation oi laboring people: He
conducalcd a school to train social
gospel ministers. he published
social action pamphlets and
preached and lectured
propheticaliy on the need to
overthrow the pressing evils oi his
time. Less than a decade ago,
Grinnell College suspended classes
in protest against Nixon's invasion
oi Cambodia, releasing hundreds
oi students to spread across the
state to explain to whoever would

 

listen |he case against the Viet»
namese war.
Perhaps it is illegitimate tor a

collegeieven Grinnell Collegeilo
move directly against the society
beyond the campus. There is a
difference. after 91], between
rational inquiry and partisan
action. Perhaps we should. as a
college, leave the reiorm oi society
to political groups and committed
individuals. Perhaps. as teachers
and students, we have no right to
pressure, or even persuade, others
to ioliow our programs, One thing,
however. we are surely entitled——
obligated—lo do: Correct the in-
justices within our own cums
inunity All oi us know that womcn
are under-represented as teachers
and administrators. and we have
known this tor a long time It is not
enough to coniess this. not enough
to say that we intend to correct it
We must make serious, concrete
plans and we must act We must,
as a contributor to this column said
last week, engineer the “upward
movement oi women into positions
of authority and responsibility."—

Truth or Dare
The Grime” beyen evoluo

by Ruth Montgomery

A few weeks ago students
received a questionnaire regarding
the White Paper and the seven
major problems or questions it
addresses. One hundredsone
students returned the question
naire, most having included
detailed Written Comments on the
points that most concerned them.
Students were asked to indicate
whether they ielt a problem was
important and needed iurther
community consideration or it they
tell it was relatively unimportant
and did not wal‘ranl further
community consideration. The
iollowing is an awkward attempt to
summarize the variety of
responses received

it Who should attend Gi-iniicli?
85 per cent of the responding
students felt that this question
should be given iurther con-
sideration. Many stressed |he need
for a diversified student
population, A number oi responr
dents felt that Grinnell would
benefit from more minorities and
several felt that Grinnell must do
more to attract the “have-nots" as
wellasthe“haves"ofall races and
ethnic groups. Countering these
remarks were those that said there
should be no quotas tor any group,
whatever the classification. While
somc added that more rural
students would be desirable, many
felt that Iowans as a speciﬁc group
should not be especially sought.
Several students were concerned
that the academic standards of
Grinnell would suffer in the search
ior greater diversification or a
larger applicant pool.

ii The question oi
development.
as per cent oi the respondents ielt
that this should be given further
consideration Those who
disagreed did so for a number of
reasons. One student felt that
personal development is not the
College‘s business and that it
should attend to academics. The
more common response was that
personal development could only
be achieved by an individualia
supportive community being
necessary, but not something that
can be created by any particular
program Others merely tell that

personal

 

the status quo is iine 0i those
students who ielt that personal
development needs iurther con-
sideration, several expressed the
thought that personal development
is_an integral part of a college
education and therefore needs
cxpliclt attention. Several students
supported a more comprehensive
advtsing system in this regard.

:ti The qticstion oi shared ox»
per-toner.
Only 48 per cent oi the student
responses indicatcd that this
question needs iurther cons
sideration, Most oi those who
agreed that a shared experience is
important disagreed with the in-
terpretation of it oiiered in the
White Paper. Many vicwed
Grinnell itseli as a shared ex-
perience and ielt that a greater
structuring of shared experiences
would be detrimental.

t) The relation oi schooling to
practical aliairs.
77 per cent at the students
responding ielt that this subject
deserves iurther consideration.
Those who wrote comments were
quite divided in their responses.
They ranged irom “Long live Ivory
Towerlsm” to “I sure as hell hope
there‘s a useable relation,” in the
middle were those who ielt that a
liberal arts education is the
ultimate in practicality and those
who suggested an increase in
career internships and continued
utilization oi life-planning
workshops. Many speciiically
separated their interest in pracs
tical education irom vocational
courses. Several students exs
pressed enthusiasm ior the use oi
“adjunct“ colleagues in classes.

5) The College and the’probiems
oi a global society.
72 per cent oi the responses in-
dicated that this question requires
iurther discussion, Some oi those
who supported iurther discussion
ielt that Grinnell tends to get too
bogged down in its own problems.
As one student put it, “Grinnell
students tend to ieel isolated and
thus look inward, instead of out»
ward We need to put our problems
in a global perspective and global
problems in our perspective.”

 

Others ielt that Grinnell had a good
program oi outside speakers which

2‘

ed

is suiiicient. One student ad-
vocated a course dealing
speciiically with the relationship
between technology and public
policy Another student ielt that
the problems oi a global society
could and should be treated in
regular courses,

til The distinctiveness ol Grin-
poll.
81 per cent or the respondents ielt
that this is an important question.
Most ielt that he should emphasize!
what We already have rather than
search out new areas for
“uniqueness." Many studer's felt
that the diversified soc' antic
recreational program oiiered at
Grinnell does much to make us
distinct from colleges like Carleton
and Lawrence.

7) Achieving a
mtiiiity.
56 per cent of the students
responding ielt that this question
needs further consideration, The
most frequent comment of lhose
who disagreed was, “How do you
enforce joy?" Some suggested that .
a happier community would be.
achieved if the administration
acted in a more open and honest
fashion with students, One student
expressed concern that the comp
mittee revision suggested in the
White Paper would drastically
reduce student involvement in the
college decision-making process.
Several students felt that diversity
of students in the dorm situation
was an asset and that tutorials
living together (sic) would limit
this div sity. Many agreed that
the condition of the residence halls
needed to be vastly improved

One student did not comment
speciiically on any oi the seven .
questions but rather sai , ”I think‘
to answer ‘unimportant to any of
the above questions is absurd.
These questions should be
discussed all the time. To try to
make a policy about the above iss’
also absurd. Each year new factors
enter the picture to outmode ist
year's “policy." Each question
Should be faced each year with
adequate input irom all concerned
sources (citizens. administration,
faculty, and Students) (not
necessarily in this order).”
