1n the face of many difficulties,
it was decided that it would he
better to discontinue programs
this year, A shortage of college
men to take part in dramatiz-
ations and to act as announcers
and technicians presented an un—
surmoimtable difficulty, Although
John Ganscrt, who was a techn’
cian at the station last year, is
still in Grinnell, his full schedule
would prevent his taking any part
in presenting broadcasts. Many of
thc skits given last year were
dramatizations of faculty members
lives, and usually more men than
women were needed to take parts.

“Programs were easily assem~
bled last fall and early spring, but
by March the situation was quitc
difficult", Mr. Duncan said. He
added that the radio station was
definitely not forgotten and
broadcasts would be resumed as
soon as possible.

Anne Kuper
Gives Reading

Famous ‘Reciialisf
Plans Reading In
Drawing Room Tuesday

As a feature of this years’ Social
Budgct Committee plans, Mrs.
Anne Birk Kuper-; famous recitale
ist in thc field of dramatic read
ing, is to give a reading in the
drawing room Tuesday, Nov. 15,
at 8:00 p m.

According to Margery Willard,
Quadrangle Social Chairman, Mrs,
Kupcr wnl present, in costume,
selections from the new play,
“Harriet", in which Helen Hayes
is currently starring on Broadway.

This will be Mrs. Kuper's third
appearance at Grinnell, and up
iperclass students may remember
her last two performances. All
women are invited to attend, and
Army men may come as guests of
college girls.

That the presence or God in our
everyday life is inescapable was
indubitably proved in the series of
Gates lectures just completed by
Harold Cooke Phillips,

“\"here Art Thou?”

The lecturer compared the rela-
tive unimportance cf the individ-
ual to thc importancc of religion
through the teachings of Christ
and, consequently, through God In
this vast universe man figures
prominently only in mass form,
and he can lose himself as easily
as he can lose his belongings. He
must find himself in God, from
whom all faith emanates.

“We find ourselves when we
find Christ, To find Christ is to
ﬁnd God." ’

Where Is Thy God?

In the search for God, man
must look within himself and
within his fellow mcn, Phillips bee
1ievcs. Within himself is that qual-
ity which cannot be satisfactorily
explained without declaring the
existence of God. In his brother,

men may observe God in valuable
part and may learn much from
observing.

But man will surely find God in
Christ, for no was God in man
personiﬁed, The presence or Christ
on earth provides an unequalled
opportunity for man to find God.

“To remember that God was
once man, to read his teachings,
Ito follow his precepts, is the ba-
‘sis of the Christian religion. It
.is tbc greatest opportunity man
has evcr been known to receive."

What Think Yo of Christ?

The necessity of building our
lives around Christ is evident
when We realize His changcless
quality, Phillips explained. We
need a changeless leader to give
us some stability. There must be
something permanent if one is to
find his Way to a world of change.
