QEhitotiul

THE ACTION taken by the class
of ’98, at their last meeting, at
which they adopted caps and
gowns. was a commendable one,
and one over which, as a rule,
a bitter ﬁght is waged. The class
of ’95 set the example, which, un-
tilthe present. has not been tol-
lowed, Caps and gowns are worn
at all the higher schools, indeed
at some of them not only by sen-
iors. but by all undergraduates.
’98 has deemed it Fit that Grinnell
should not be behind in this, any
more than in other respects. Let
us hope that this custom will not
be concluded with the present
promoters, but will be continued
by other classes.

SELDOM HAS the privilege been
granted to the students of Grine
nell to enjoy a visit irom a more
inspiring man than john B. De
Motte. Sothoroughlyacquainted
with his subject tliro years ofcare-
ful rescarch in tlle laboratory, and
so thoroughly imbued with the
importance of the matter that he
has to present, is he. that his pres»
ence is irresistible. The English
language fails utterly when driven
to describe the intense interest

‘lvith which his hearers hang on
every word as it falls from his lips,
For two succeeding years, Prof.
DeMotte has been one of the lead—
ing attractions of the Y. M. C. A,
course, and his many iricnds here
hope that his visit may be repeate
ed early in the future. l

THE success or rather pro-
nounced lack oi success of the
Y. M. C. A. plan as dcmonstrated
by the lecture Saturday evening
is certainly a matter tor comment

tThe _cxpenses of the preceding

. become neccssaty roi-

W is in

 

lectures had been so well attcii

ed to by the audiences that the
management considered the out
look fora successful season very
favorable. But
Saturday evening was such as to
rudely tlispcl those hopes, As a
l'csult lhc lcasibiliiy or continuing
the plan is much questioned. The
Y. M. C A. lrlce other college or
gallizations is already in debt and
does not care to add to the bur;
dcn. No one attempts to deny
that much good has been accom-
plished through this plan, neither
can it he denied that much in»
conveniciicc has resulted. It has
those at-
tending to be at the door shortly
after 7 o'clock it they are to se~
cure a scat. When such a crowd
atleirdands it would seem
that the expenses would be easily
met with n considerable bonus
each time. But instead
ciety almost invariably runs be~
hind. When it is also considered
that the very ones who nre treat-
ed to “I‘lohson‘s Choice" in the
matter of seats are those who are
the largest contributors in a ﬁnan-
cial way, it certainly appears as
though, some change would be
advisable. No plan is advocat-
ed by which any would beide‘,
prived ot the privileges of the
course. But ifa ccrtnin'tew. are

expcnscs they should be allowed
a little choice in regardstp sent
If it is the intciitionmto on y
the trial ot this plan ‘ iurther,
in the {ace of recent discourage-
merits we would stingest' som‘c‘
such modiﬁcation.
