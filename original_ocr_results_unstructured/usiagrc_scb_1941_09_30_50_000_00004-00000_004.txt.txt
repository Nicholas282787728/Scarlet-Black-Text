 

IT HAS BEEN common knowledge lot years that collegians play an important part in in-

lluencing men's styles. Not until this fall however, has this recognition been brought to the
surlace and displayed in broad daylight.

The nation's attention was drawn to this ﬁeld by the recent Saturday Evening Post port-
tolio of style, represented by surveys of style trends at 39 important U. S. colleges. Collegiate
Digest and Associated Collegiate Press are proud to present on these pages the story behind
the most recent recognition at the importance of the college to an industry. It's real news,

The Satevepost spread below and the charts in the center at the page partially show their
treatment of the subject Space limitations prevent our showing complete survey results and
those pictured are lrorn the national summary. While there are sectional differences, most col-
lege men agree on definite style trends.
