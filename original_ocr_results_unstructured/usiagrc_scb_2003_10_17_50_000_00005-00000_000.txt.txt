“I became obsessed with trying to break [the ﬁrst Nalgene

during rhe summer at my construction job."

Lu reiterated rhe brealtabiliry of the bottles. “Although my
Nalgencs seem unbreakable," she said, “Naigcnes nave! claim to

Nalgene stories

Several Grinnellians have owned Nalgene bottles for long
enough rhar rheir berries have beeome an integral part of their
memories, or even their lives.

“I was voted ‘Most Likely to Have the World’s Largest Nalgene
collection by my high school,” said Lu. “[i’ve used] one army
Nalgeries to make shake ‘n’ pour paneakes while I’m camping.
My Nalgene [also] serves as a billboard for my beliefs and inter
ests. on my water bottle, I have a ‘Lovc is Never Wrong End
Homophobia' seeker. whieh etreerively expresses how I feel abour
gay rights."

“I rarely pur anyrhing but water in my [Nalgene]," said
Pederson. ”but I know a person who was stuck in trafﬁc in New
iersey on the way to a Giants football game that really had to go
pee. Well, you know rhe resr."

"some people know me by my Nalgene," said Zigas. “I have
traveled an extra four-plus hours [which] I otherwise wouldn’t
have to retrieve my Nalgene arrer I have torgouen ir. I’ve [also]
been known to eulrivare a multi—colared bacteria colony on the
mouthpiece from tin-re to time.”

“I own four Nalgenes,” said Phelps. “one is with my cx-boy-
friend not worth getting it baek. one is a miniature with a
small mouth opening. and that’s missing. one is a large blue origi—
nal wirh a Britney spears sticker on is thar I found in the weight
room.The last is my newest and it is a small version with a mini-
large mouth opening."

“When 1 was at the National Theater Institute in Connectie
cur: continued Phelps, ”everyone either brought Nalgenes with
them, or bought them before they left, ineluding the head orrhe
National Theater institute. They beeame the thing to have for
convenience. At the end of the semester we went to St. Peters-
burg. Russia, to srudy at the st. Perersburg Theater Ans Aead.
emy. we brought seven students back to Conneetieur wirh us, as
well as their director. As a way to show thanks, the National
Theater institute purehased Nalgenes for all orrhem to rake back
re Russia with them. so, now it's going to be a world trend, in
stead ora eollege campus trend!"
