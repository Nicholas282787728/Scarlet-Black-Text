Shades of Racism:
The covert, the blatant — the problem exists

A child is block,
A child is white;
Together they grow

To see the light

Approximately woo people are perma
nent residents of Grinnell, Iowa—a
predominantly white working class and
professional community. In addition to the
permanent residents, Grinnell College
students add nearly 1,200 people, bringing
the total number of residents to nearly
10,000. In this population of almost 10,000,
there are three black families, 55 black
students at the college and several black
college staff and faculty members,
Figures in the March 6, 1981 Scarlet and
Black, given by William Deminoff, direc-
tor of College Relations and the college’s
Affirmative Action officer, Show that the
highest black enrollment in the past la
years was in 1973, when 73 black students
were attending the college. This number
dropped to 34 in 1980 and has since risen.

LaVeta Small, director of Minority Af-
fairs, reported that she has experienced
and heard of “overt and blatant" racial
hostility in the town since she came here
last summer, She noted that the most com-
mon and noticeable form is stares and add-
ed that such action“doesn't frustrate me
because I’ve dealt with it for awhile. I‘m
used to questions and the pure ignorance.”
The reaction of black students, however, is
often different.

“Some kids are really frightened to go
into town, especially after an incident last
fall when the parents of a black student
were insulted in a local restaurant." She
added that while there were no physical at-
tacks on black students last fall, “looks
and jeers” were reported.

Sophomore Monica Leonard‘s outlook on
the presence of racism, in the town is a
result of perceived expressions made by
townspeople, As a student, Leonard’s
views on the issues are quite solid. When
speaking of perceived expressions of

racism by townspeople, she asserted, “It -

may seem paranoid to some, but the looks
and responses by people in town, like the
cashiers in stores, imply that they look
down on you, or they would rather look
around you and not notice that you’re dif»
ferent. Well, of course I’m different. I’m a
black person. It's not healthy to overlook
that fact, since it’s important they accept
me as I am."

As a result of these beliefs, leonard
doesn‘t feel that the town is a healthy place
to live if one is black and is conscious of
racism and its different forms. She said

ed staring are local chili and spaghetti
fundraising dinners she has attended. “I
was the only black there, and l'm not sure
if people were sharing because I’m a
stranger or because I’m a minority."
However, she added, “There was a dif-
ference in the mood [of the room] as soon
as other [white] people talked to me,"

Although she finds her social life limited,
she blames the situation on “the nature of
being an academic and the location" of the
collegeinot her race. ”I feel Cut off from
the active black community outside Grin-
nell, but if I were in an urban place, I
would not necessarily join an active, black
social group.”

William Hunter, a black professional
who serves as head of the radiology
department at Grinnell General Hospital,
perceives no “barriers to entry" into the
Grinnell social arena. Yet he does find
cultural deprivation and compensates for
it by traveling to Des Moines. The larger
black community there provides him with
exposure to elements particular to black
culture such as music and food.

Hunter, who moved to Grinnell from
Cleveland, ohio, with his family five years
ago, finds Grinnell a safe place to raise his
children and to practice his profession. He
believes Grinnell could be a good nurturs
ing place for other black professionals. He
said he does not feel any effects of racism
but is unsure how he would be accepted if
he were not an upper class professional.
The resentment against the community of
Cambodian refugee families who compete
with Grinnell’s utablished residents for
jobs may indicate, he said, that economic
factors, and not race, determine pre-
judicial attitudes.

“I hear more talk in town about the
refugees" than about blacks in regard to
racial hostility, said Dave McConnell, the
first ward representative on Grinnell’s Ci-
ty Council and the director of Food of Grin-
nell. The four Cambodian families in town
have been discriminated against by the
council and community in subtle ways, he
explained, but the hostility towards them
is greater than any found toward other

discrimination on account of race, Sex,
religion, age and handicap, which are ap—
plied to such situations as housing,
employment and access to public ac-
comodatlons. A seven member Human
Rights Commission investigates any alleg-
ed violations, Robert Grey, associate pro-
fessor of political science, has served four
years on the commission. He reports that
one complaint has been filed so far this
academic year, while five or six were filed
in ﬁle 1981732 period, Few of the cases are
based on racial discrimination, he said,
but are usually “employmentrelated,”

In addition, Ellison feels that the
“sophisticated" racism exhibited on Grin-
nell‘s campus is more offensive than evi-
dent discrimination. ”I can deal with overt
racism. l know what it is and where it’s
coming from... this stuff here is bad."

Joell suggested that the communication
barriers between black students and white
students may stem from nervousness or
unfamiliarity with blacks in general felt by
many whites. “It's possible that it‘s really,
really subtle. But it‘s not to anyone’s
benefit to be racist. Despite the ‘llberal'
appearance of many, often white people
may feel inside that their liberalism is all
bullshit because we don't have tailike

heard “second and third hand” of such
discriminatory acts. The most recent in-
volved a black college student who applied
for a summer job in town and when he was
refused employment, tiled a complaint on
the basis of racial discrimination. The
commission's investigation showed “a
clear case of lousy communication by the
personnel director,” who had no positions
open for any new employees, Grey recall~
ed. Another case occurred before Grey
came to Grinnell in 1968 and before the for-
mation of the commission. This incident
involved barbers in town who refused to
cut the hair of black college students.

Grey said, “I have no grounding,
although at times one hears muttering
about white versus black, But there is
clearly a segment of the Grinnell popula-
tion that is hostile to blacks."

minorities. One example McConnell cited
was the council's refusal to allocate money
from the local Campbell Estate fund to one
family that had lost its income. “The
money from the estate is supposed to go to
the worthy poor," but the majority of the
council members voted against giving it to
the family, Such discrimination is “not
overt," he said, but obviously exists.

that the isolation of the town denies many
of the townspeople the realization that
blacks can be diverse in their backgrounds
and are not homogeneous. Because of the
status of the few blacks in the town, ex-
cluding the college, Leonard believes that,
to a certain degree, townspeople have felt
ease in communicating with blacks, but
the effort is not genuine.

Alice Deck, a black assistant professor
of English who has lived in Grinneu for
three years, has also “noticed people star-
ing." Because the community is ”depen-
dent On face value," she said, blacks ex-
perience high visibility in the town,
especially during the summer when cola

mented. “But I’ve always been in a pretty

McConnell agreed with Hunter that the
economic factors of racism are probably
more important in determining peoples’
attitudes. “In any small town, if a minority
family comes into town and is gainfully
employed, you would probably have good
absorption," McConnell commented. He
also speculated that it a minority student
got into trouble in town or an interracial
couple was seen in town, “certain
elements” of the population might react in
a more hostile manner than if the students
were white. _

According to Robert Joell, a Grinnell
senior, the presence of racist sentiments
held by townspeople is questionable to
some extent. He said, “l'm not sure if it's
me... It’s hard to tell who's being rude or
arrogant and whether it’s because I'm
black or because I'm a student.” He add—
ed, “There are some genuinely nice peo-
ple... it depends on what time it is,”
However, when asked whether or not he’s

According to Small, the “real, concerted
effort to recruit black students" at Grin-
nell College is a “healthy effort.” But even
though these students are the “cream of
the crop black students," they experience
racism on campus. This hostility differs
from that found in town because it is
“more subtle, sophisticated and
subliminal.”

Karen Ellison, a senior at Grinnell, has
had the opportunity to develop greater ins
sight into the townspeople then the
average black student. in addition to the
communication she has with the town
throughout the school year, she has also
spent a summer in Grinnell.

Consequently, she developed a much
more extensive outlook on the reactions of
any of the townspeople towards her as a
black person. Ellison said, “I’ve educated
white people... You have to accept rapom
sibility for yourself as the only black
female in town." Ellison is able to deal
with whatever difficulities she many incur
in communicating with the townspeople.
She explained, ”I understand they haven’t
been exposed, haven’t taken initiative and
don't know about much outsideof a small
town. I try to dispell ignorance... they still
say ‘colored.’ "

However, Ellison’s tolerance changes
totally when referring to the campus. She
explains that, because of the “pretense of
liberalness,” the campus becomes a
cradle of hypocrisy. “It’s easier for me to
accept attitudes of ignorance in town than
from college students. Many of these peo-
ple claim to be so liberal) The majority of
them certainly don’t reflect this in any
way other than that they can coexist in

students. “A lot of times black students
come here with the idea that they'll be
tolerated and are then not accepted,"
Small said. “They pick up cold, stand-
offish vibes.”

Ellison spoke of a particular incident
that occured approximately two years
ago. Because of the formation of a Black
Table, there were some misperceptions
among some white Grinnell students. The
notion of separatism was attributed to the
black students, and Ellison said mis “pro
ved the closemindedness of many on cams
pus... some think that blacks don’t need a
support system.” Overall, she has not been
pleased with the social atmosphere of
Grinnell created between blacks and
whites. “I’m disillusioned with Grinnell. i
expected it to be liberal.”

The only solution Small sees to this
separation is “through dialogue.” She sug-
gsted that meetings of dorm floors might
be the best environment for such dialogue,
because “it's safer, more comfortable,
and people can be free to ask questions.”
Generally, she advised members of the
campus community, “When dealing with
black students you need to make a genuine
effort to make the student feel comfor-
table.”

Yet Leonard has not found many of the
students to be even superficially “liberal.”
Leonard is the youngest person living in
the Black Cultural Center, which is located
farther north than Norris on 10th Ave, and
said that it all stems from the negative at-
titudes that she perceived on campus.
Even though she arrived in Grinnell with
an open mind, she quickly devloped a less
than optimistic perspective on the real in
tegration of blacks and whites on
Grinnell‘s campus. Leonard experienced
reactions that left much to be desired from
the members of the house in which she was
originally placed. She said of her ex-
perience, “l was the only black person in
the house. Though the situation was new
for most of us, the others found support
among themselves. Not even my so at
tempted to reach out. I wasn’t told about a
meeting on one occasion and a party was
given in the room next door, which Iwasn’t
invited to. I couldn’t even listen to my
music without scowls."

But racism doesn’t end with the
students, Ellison, like Leonard and Joell,
believes that the administration has been
remiss in its obligation to create a more
stimulating environment for cultural ex-
change, She said that since she’s been
here, the recent Open Forum on Cultural
Diversity is the first time that she
remembers the administration taking an
active role, Ellison does, however, regard
the appointment of Small to the position of
director of Minority Affairs as a step in the
right direction.
