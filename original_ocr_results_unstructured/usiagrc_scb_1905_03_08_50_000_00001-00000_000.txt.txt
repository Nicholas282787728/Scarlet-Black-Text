Iowa for the deciding grime 0f the sea-

son in basket hiill. The work of the

locals was d surprise [0 many who had
LllougllL that the team was more or
lesslbroken up. The game wcs thc
Lilml Due for the Inter-collegiate has
ken hall championship of the State
,zmd as Such was of more than usual
interest. At the close of the contest
the score stood tilil‘tyri‘our to twenty
six in iiirol‘ oi Grinnell and [he ClOWd
departed wearing tilesmilc that would
II’Jt come 0|l'.

At the start Grinllell made it brilli
cut showing. going into the gcmc with
n rush that guincd ngood lccd which
was held [Urir time but as the half
progressed loivn gained and at its
close the score Stood ﬁiicen to i’ilul‘r
teen in Iowa’s furor. ~

In the ﬁrst of the second hilll'ltllezlezid
alternated. At one time Ioirzi was in
thclccd by several points, and Grin-
ilell metals were fearful [or the ﬁlial
outcome of the game. But about the
middle of the half Grinnell took a.
brace and by buliching several baskets
gnined a good lead. Iowc did not seem
able to recover herseli and the hall
closed [liter Crl‘imiell had increased by
ccouplc oi baskets her margin over
Iowa.

Grillith and Burton did the best
work for Iowa. although Grillith’s
guard secured three baskets. Ccpt.
Schenk did not seem to play, his usual
good game and was also unlucky in
throwing iouls. For Grinncll every
man played it star game so that it is
impossible to Say who carried Oil the
ﬁrst honors. As usual Wilder and
Brundcge could clwcys be counted on
todo good work. Nor-tun played a
brilliant gnme and gives promise or
being it most valuable man. DeIIadn
and Clack also showed up well. Tile
latter had hard luck losing two tries
which seemed certain to Iesult in tally
lies. One good feature 01' Gl'illnell’s
work was the absence of any attempt
at grandstand plnying by individuals.
