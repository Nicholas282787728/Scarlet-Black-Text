fied before the Senate Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Labor,
Health, and Human Services, Edu-

Washington, D.C. on March 28.

Representing Campus Compact,
a national organimLion of college
andunivcrsrty presidents that works
to promote collegiate community
service projects, Koth urged contin-
ucd Senate funding of ACTION
StudentCommumtyServiceGrants.
ACTION grants provide aid to
schoolsandcommunity-basedmom

grams strive to eliminate poverty-
rclated problems and agree to place
students in volunteer positions.

Currently 121 programs in 43
states, including 62colleges and uni»
versities, are funded through AC4
’l‘ION grants.

President Drake has assured the
continuation of the Gnnnell Com-
munity Service Center, which re-
ceived an ACTION grant in 1988.
Koth's involvement in the CSC

Encouraged Throughout Campus

continued from page I

Admissions, said that discussions

of admission plans focused on the
necessity of increased personal
contact between the college and
studentsofcolor. Sheaddedthatthe
meeting also discussed the defini-
tion ofmulticulturalism. "Multiculr
tural means more thanjust students
of color on campus. The meeting
focused on the whole broad plCr
tore—students,faculty.andcurricu-
lum," she said.

Members of the executive counr
cil emphasized thesenscofcommit-
merit to the creation ofa multicultu-
ral cnvrronment. “I think everyone
who was at the meeting was imr
pressed by the posiuve tone," said
Chuck Jepsen, science department
chair. “There was no sense of con-
frontation; there was a definite foelr
in gof cooperation on how to achieve
a common goal." Jepsen also noted
the sense of urgency in the fulfillr
ment of that goalia sense that
expressed the need to carry forward
the enthusiasm and commitment
already present.

Eric Wynn, director of Multiculr
tural Affairs, attended the meetings
and noted the positive attitude to
ward the college’s progress.
“There's an excitement in the air,"
he said. “There is tangible evidence
of progress at each level of this insti-
tution.“

Wynn stressed not only the
amount of change since 12m fall’s
committee meeting, but also the
progresssince his arrival 14 months
ago. He cited this semester’s mul-
ticultural symposium. the renaming
of the Office of Minority Affairs,
and the proposed creation of an ex-
ecutive administrativeposition fora
person of color as examples of that
progrcss.

“It takes time. The fact that the
college is discussing the executive
position is progress," he said. “That
wouldn'tevenhavcbecnonthetable
a year ago. If all this can happen in
14 months‘ time, or even four

months' time, the possibilities for
things to happen in the next two
years are tremendous.”

Representatives from Concerned
Black Students (CBS), Student
Organization of Latinos/Latinas
(SOL), and All Studenls Interested
in Asia (ASIA) were also present at
the moetingandemphasizedthenwd
for multiculturalism in the curricu
lum and on the campus. “The fac-
ulty hiring is a good step, but the
departments which received the new
faculty (American Studies and
English) are easily open [0 the mul-
ticultural perspective," said Julie
Runk. representative of SOL.
“Multiculturalism should spread l0
all classes."

"I think many students believe
that people of color on campus are
separatist, that the multicultural
organizations aren't open to every-
one, That‘s a concern we have to
face," she added.

The student representatives were
also concerned with the impact of
the committee’s suggesuonsandthc
proposed solutionson thecampusas
awholc. Eddie Chung, sludentrep-
resentative of ASIA, said that the
importance of multiculturalism is
often overshadowed by other issues.
“Multiculturalism does not appear
to be the ﬁrst and foremost issue on
people'sminds,”hesaid. “It‘sfrus
uating: until the college makes a
prioritizedcommiunent,notawhole
lot of change will happen very
quickly. It seems to be a long-term
process."

Runk said that a multicultural
coalition survey, devised by mem-
bers of CBS, SHADES, ASIA, and
SOL,willbesentouttostudentsand

faculty, possibly next week. "The

survey is designed to gauge interest
in multicultural issues, in order to
determine what students and faculty
want," she said.

The PCSMP will continue to
meet twice yearly to help try to cre-
ate a more diverse college environr
mentas well as increase iLs inter-
action with students.
