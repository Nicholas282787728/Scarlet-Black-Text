As the academic year begins. students
who have eager]. awaited the onset of the
“Grinllell Experience" are being introduc-
ed to an unexpected and unwelcome iacet

over the past ten years. Grinneil's
popularity has been steadily increasing.
and each fall lhe number of incoming
irestimen has risen accordingly. This sprs
mg. over 400 treshlncll were admitted and.
to the dismay ol the campus community.
are presently crammed into every living
space available on campus Some have
been placed in oll-tdmpus. college owned
houses. while others remain on the campus
proper in triples and quad: and in cons
verted lounges or recreation rooms.

everything possible is being done to
alleviate the problem. For others.
however, it is an annoying as well as un-
comtortable experience and one that they
test is a very poor welcome to Grinnell Col»

The discomfort is Illlensllied {or some
ireslimen. who tool that the adjustment to
Grinnell is diliicult enough vitiiout being
laced with three strangers and having to
move only shortly atter getting settled

Freshmen presently rooming in what

expressed that they lelt like “excess.
misplaced baggage."

classes. especially the ireshmen
tutorials. are also suticring due to the ins
crease. Lower level classes are otten strets
ched to maximum capacity and. the

tutorials are necessarily larger to accom-
modate the added number ot students.

The overcrowding. according to Bob
'l'owneiuLarsen. Director or student Al-
iau-s. has occurred this year because oi
two tactors: a recent decrease in the
senior attrition rate. and an outdated ace
ccptance and admissions policy.

At one time. the attrition rate ior
seniors. because oi academic leaves and
cxpulsions was expected to number 20 to 25
pcople. This year that level was reduced to
only tour. thereby eliminating at least 2i
expected spaces tor incoming students

In addition. Grinncll has gained
widespread attention tor its academic pro-
grams and large endowment in recent
years, and yet. unlike many other small
liberal arts colleges. Grinnetl has not
adopted a waiting list policy loradmission.
Coupled with the recent climb in popul ~
i, this reiusai to create a waiting list.
which would allow the admissions oiiice
more ltexibility in its admitting policy. has
led to higher than expected enrollment.

Under Grinnell's present system. which
is based upon admitted student accep-
tance. the admissions stall was instructed
to allow tor 370 to 375 students witli no
