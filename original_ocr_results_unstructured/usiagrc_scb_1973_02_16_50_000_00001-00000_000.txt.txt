i ISU Affirms Fund Withdrawal;

State ISPIRG Staff Cut

by Don Dagenais
Only two people remain on the professional staff for the Iowa Student
Public Interest Research Group (ISPIRG) this week following the with—
drawal oi iunds from the state organization by the lowa State University
ISPIRG group, lowa state had provided 80% oi the organization's iunding.
The reduction in staff, which took place last weekend after a meeting
between the low State ISPIRG organizers and the StateISPIRG group
produced no change in the ISU position, will substantially reduce the
state group’s ability to undertake legal action to implement the results
oi its research, ISPIRG state board chairman Mary Jane Wynn told the
SdzB this week.

they felt that "it would give us the
opportunity to give the money to a
place where it will benefit the en—
tire campus community,” Station
Manager John Seeley told the 58:8
last week,

After that decision was announced,
however, SGA Vice-President John
Pfeffer called for a meeting bet-
ween KDIC board members, SGA
cabinet members, and representa-
tives from CBS. At that time| the
decision was made to once again
designate the Martin Luther King
Scholarship Fund as the recipient
of the money.

"Many people viewed it as a trade
ition," Seeley said. “We felt a lit»
tle guilty about cutting oitthe money
without notitying anyone ahead or
time.”

Members of CBS had been expres—
sly disappointed in the mole dev
cision, said Seeley, since the money
from last semester's SAGA fasthad
not gone to the scholarship fund but
had rather been split between the
Fund and the Peace Collective. When
the SAGA fast decision was made
last semester SGA “implied to CBS
that they would get the money from
the auction," he said.

Despite the fact that SGA had no
such authority to designate a recip~

Bontemps: Black
literary Tradition

by irma Mcciaurin

When one encounters Mr. Arna
Bontemps, Sr. he may find it eas-
ier to Visualize such a historical
personage as Frederick Douglass.
The distinguished Mr. Bontempts is
a portrait ot wisdom, intellect and
amiability.

The lecture given Monday night
was the first of it series of talks
on “The AfrorAmerican Literary
Tradition:
particular lecture concentrated on
the poetic tradition in AirorAmerr
ican writings,

Mr. Bontempts asserted in his
speech that the Negro spiritual was
“the beginning or intluentiat poetic
expression.” He explained that
Afro-American writing “has been
a response to oppression” from the
writer’s viewpoint and “a metaphor
of human experience for the white
reader.”

The popularity oi the slave nar-
rative, he went on to explain, in the
late 18th and 19th century proved
that universally it epitomized “the
effort of humanity tofreeitselffrom
chains."

Mr. Bontempts concluded by stat—
ing that those who do not view Afro-
American literature as a part of
the American literary tradition are
merely deluding themselves,

Perhaps the most stimulating sec~
tion of the lecture occurred when
Mr, Bontemps. prompted by queSe
tions from his audience, related his

Ultimatum Politics

by Curt Gorrell

How does a cookie crumble? Take It in your hand and crush it with your

will.

How does the concept of an effective statewide student action agency
become translated in reality to a corporation torn and crippled by bureaur

cratic infighting?

The concept for ISPIRG is founded upondeclsion-maklngthrough the dome
ocratic process at the state board level, Some people actually believe

that it can work in that manner.

Its Beginnings,” This ‘

Recently adherents to this concept have been Jolted by the introduction

of a new element in the decision-making process 7 the Ultimatum. And
the Ultimatum hasn't been very Compatible with attempts to practice
democracy.
' Student leaders from Iowa State University raised questions about
ISPIRG staff performance, staff salaries, and particularly the issue of
obtaining a staff member to work directly with their school, In January
they told the state hoard that they had the money (and thus the power)
to obtain their objective, even if the board would not agree to authorize
their action. Ultimatum They have since split fromthe state organization,
cutting off 80% of the current ISPIRG funding.

As a result of the critical financial situation, the ISPIRG state board
determined that staff cuts would have to be made, The state board decided
to review the case of each staff member separately. The Executive Dlr~
ector addressed the board on the issue of his possible termination. He
informed the members that should he be asked by the board to resign,
he would not assist any new ISPIRG appointee in making the transition
to oversee the ISPIRG legislative study, which hehad headed. That smacks
of Ultimatum.

Such issues should be decided on their merits, not under the threat of
Ultimatumi

There’s ti Viable concept for ISPlRG, and there’s an existing framework
for its effective translation to reality. It’s time people got their heads
TOGETHER on THAT ISSUE, An unyielding Clash of Ultimatum: will
not serve that purpose, That's how a Cookie crumbles.

Mezvinsky Urges

by Steve Nunn

Ed Mezvinsky, Grinnell’s new US.
Congressman, came to campus Mane
day and said students’ research can
help remedy the ”lack oi inlormae
tion" that now handicaps Congress,
particularly in its dealings with the
White House and the executive bran-
ch,

Mezvinsky virtually issued anopen
invitation to students to getlnvolved
in the legislative process through
research, along the lines oi work
now being done by ISPIRG and by
some group independents who plan
to submit the results oi their proe
jects to interested lowa Congress
men and senators.

Speaking in the South Lounge to
a group or about 20 students and a
lew faculty members, Mezvinsky
said such input from students could
make Congress better able to do
its lob. He said Congress does cur-
rently have data and information as
good as that available to the alter
cuiive branch

This has handicapped Congress in
its dealings with the executivebran-
ch or government to the point where
the legislature is in danger of be.

with no real power in government,"
