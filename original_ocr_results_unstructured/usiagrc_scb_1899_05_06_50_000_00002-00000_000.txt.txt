to the notice. \l‘iHCll appears in an-
other column. of the mass meeting
to be lielrl next Tuesday evening
to consider the honor system.
Th is a matter which pertuiiis
strictly to students. and it is ad-
vrsable that the students should
sltow a ﬁtting interest in it. This
meeting demands rind shoulrl have
a full attendance.

The serum; athletic season is
now at its height; the near ftiiiiie
promises to bring forth some of
tlte most exciting contests evei
\Vitnessed in Iowa.

In less than three weeks. will
occur the State Field Meet. which
promises to be closer than evei
this year. now that Drake has
come so rapidly to tlte front and

once the chick competitors. A
glance at the records made by the
Drake athletes at the home meet
yesterday. will convince even the
most sanguine supporters of town

termiilcd effort can win the State
Meet this year.

games are rapidly approaching.
Coriiell.and Iowa City are both
iepresented by exceptionally
strong teams this year. and ale

rather weak. there is no certainty

that she will be found so in the
future.

There is need of hard. faithful
and united work. both on the track
and on the diamond. It is a max-
im which has been often repeated.
but is none the less true. that work
is the source of the success of Iowa
College in the past. and is her on.
ly hope in the future. and this can
not be impressed too strongly tip-
on the members of the diffeicnt

teams. The student-body expect
their very best efforts from all the
athletes. ltis tube hoped that
they may ttot be disappointed,

welcome the members of the
