DEBATE.

The interest which the debating ac-
tivities 0f the different college literary
societies is awakening this year is
most, gratifying L0 the friends 01 soci-
ety “or . The two illiel'societ)‘ (le-
hates held so tar [his year have await

ened more than the usual amount ot’ *

interest. But best or all they bare
been liltal't‘slilly discussions at ques-
tions that are of eve any concern to
all students.

soccmc FOOTBALL. ’

Tlii'u the eitorts of some triends or
the game Grinneli will have an oppor-
tunity next tail to become acquainted
with the soccer game ot lootllall.
Whether this game will ultimately dis-
place the present game is a question
tor the tutnre to decide. The new
game. however, will place another in-
teresting and stimulating activity
within the reach oi the students or the
college. its development in Grinneil
will be watched with interest.

people to place scholarship on a tour

INTER CoLLh'Gmi .ii‘hu-li'zc'o'.

To one who has listened l‘or three or
four years to elaborate and caretully
formed statements as to the \lllrloulltcrl
value oi intercollegiate games to the
pin, er, the spectator and the college, it
is difficult to appreciate the lorce oi'
the suggestions recently made by Pres-
ident Treuiri ol the lows Stilts Board
at Control, the orgm tiou that dr
rects the educational work oi the tlr c
Iowa state institutions. There is, noun
ever, nrrrcli value in his statement. in
a very lew years the mlleges ot the
country will come to a rerv “eilei‘lli ap~
preciation oi' the iorce or it. At the
present time the college athlet . life
if “long" on the show side and iori"
on the athletic side. So iar a pros
test against this condition has come
only from the college laculties but the
growing inter - or business men in
education, the increasing demand that
the college train its students to emu
iency, keeping at the same time the
spirit of culture, makes it more and
more diificult to recoglli’ some cur--
rent practices in athletic lilc as 00..
ducive to the realization oi the ulti-
mate idea].

What Griiincll college needs and
every other college in this state is
more athletic life of the right sol't, an
athletic lite that will lint every man
and woman in the institution in touch

each year nea all the men or the
college are provided with some game
which gives both recreation and is at
the stripe tune some incentive to the
development or ideas oi sensible physi-
cal eiticieucy. Brit the system as
yet is very inadequate and there is
great roour for improvement. This does
not mean that all intercollegiate con~
tests need he done away with but it
does mean that these should be made
subordinate to the needs of all mem-
bers of the student bod The ions
College Athletic association is doing a
grant work in Grinnell in developing
the lnterclass athletic activities of the
