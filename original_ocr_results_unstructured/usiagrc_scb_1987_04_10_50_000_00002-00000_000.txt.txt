tire theme should be changed if Joint

porting Jack Kemp, it is George Bush's
nomination unless he blows it. He’s cer-
talnly got a good lead and nobody's going
to take it away from him unless he himself
makes a mistake. The Democrats, I don’t
think it makes any difference, I Can’t think
of anybody the Democrats could nominate
who could win.

helpless to do anything about it.

Scarlet and Black: What do you think
Congress should do to influence the South
African government?

Edwards: I think we should do what we
have done. We have in the past censured
the government of South Africa, Now we
have imposed sanctions. I think those
things are absolutely required. whether
they’re going to finally have an effect i

government to respond to these questions, but you
certainly make it in their best interests to respond

to them. "

increase of the depletion allowance. to help

economy of Oklahoma is in very bad
shape, just as the economies of Texas and
LouiSlana are in very bad shape. For the
country, that’s very bad news because
what‘s going to happen is, as we increase

Scarlet and Black: You said in your
speech diat Ronald Reagan has changed
the tone of politics. How has he done that?

Edwards: When I first was elected. all of
the discussion was on what new programs
and agencies we could create, Now it's
totally reversed. The people who were adr
vacating new programs are now fighting
desperately to keep the programs that
they already have and are debating which
programs must be cut and which saved.

 

Faculty retentton

“even within its own league. working conr
ditiolis at Grinnell do not compare
favorably." A lighter class load. graduate
courses, and a more cosmopolitan environ
ment were listed by Jones as lures to
which faculty are particularly responsive.
He did not think salary was a “major fac-
tor" in retention.

According to i-iietala, “pay issues are
significant at Grinnell, but professors are
paid poorly across the nation, so that is a
national problem, not just a local problem."

Some of the faculty members interviewr
ed suggested solutions to retain iaculty
members at Grinnell. One faculty
member, who wished to remain
anonymous. suggested that “institutional
effort to help in producing grant proposals

~ from page 1
and linding research money," as well as
increased salaries. might help, These sug»
gestions were popular. iiietala added that
“the administration could possibly expand
the size of faculty significantly." but deans
elect of the taculty. Charles Duke said, “A
drastic increase in the size of the faculty is
not in the card t‘s a matter of keeping
up during the sc ol year and catching up
during the summer,"

Catherine Frazer, the outgoing dean of
faculty. maintains the belief that
Grinnell's facultyrretention problem 15
overstated. “To me, it ifaculty depar-
turesl is at a very healthy rate,...l would
worry if we didn't have faculty that other
institutions wanted.”
