student artwork trotn the up.
per.ievel ceramics and sculpture
couises last fall is on display in the
Fine Arts gallery.

This exhibition is a unique op—
portunity to see art from a variety of
students, it provides exposure to
those students outside of a seminar
shoiv.

The work from the zoo and 400.
level ceramics courses is glazed stone.
ware including jars, bowls, vases and
plates of traditional and more curt.
ous forms. Andrea Martin, ‘96,
brushed metallic oxides over a dip»
glazed bowl set to create beautiful
accentsand colors. onanothetpiece
she sprayed several glazes over each
other, effecting a gradual blend of
tone. All the work can be seen at
Martin's senior exhibition in two
weeks.

The sculpture works are mostly

painted plaster, and among the more
eye<catching is “Saturn Devoiiring
His Children” by Joel Griffith, ‘96.
His cartoonlike depiction of the
mythological figure is more imagina—
me than the traditional representa»
tion, and the colors are strikingly
vivid. This green monstercharacteh
izes a more humorous perspective on
the Titan.

A truly interactive work is Roy
Rich's “Metainatic Music Box,"
which uses wooden pins on a tevolv»
ing Cylinder to stnke eight copper
pipesandproduce musicaltones. H.s
ideas on kinetic art come from the
French artist, Jean Tinguely. He
tries to engage the viewer rnore effec—
tively because. asRich, ‘96, says, “art
should be experiencet

Students in the 300rlevelsculpr
ture class also produced selfrportralt
busts in terra cotta. I’Iinio Barraza,
‘96, inverts the head in his self»por»
trait, and like a jack-orlantern, it
radiatesahauntingintensitythrough
its hollow eyes.

Professor Royce Wolf will play a
piano recital in the MayflowerI-lome
Social Center Auditorium on Satur—
day March 2nd, starting at 2 pm.

He will perform contemporary
music written between 1900 and
1950. including works of Aaron Co—
peland, Arnold Shoenbetg, Maurice
Ravcl, Paul Hinderslnith, and Bela
Bartok. According to Wolf, his fa»
voritcpiecewillbctheBartoksonata
because it “is incredibly amazing."
Although Bach is one of his favorite
musicians. he no longer performs his
work because it is too showy and
difficult.

Wolf explains that after taking
the Job as a professor. he has moved
away from showy pieces to works
more easily understand, Hc crcdits
teaching as helping him realize the
importance of involving the audlr
ence “It's a different way to ap«
proach and play music, to make it
accessible and understandable to the
listener instead ofshoWing off,“ says
Wolf. He occasionally talks about
the songs during breaks in the recit<
als to help the audience become more
involved in the music. He tries to
involve the audience by entertain»
ingthemashe plays. Averyenergeh
ic performer, he accentuates each
keystroke.

A rnath protessor, Wolf occa-
sionally finds ways to integrate his
musical skills into his teaching, Last
semester he taught a tutorial relating
math and music. Wolf says that
plans for a book about math and

music are in the works. Earning a
maior in music as well as math has
given Wolf a background of great
understanding of the technical side
of pieces.

Wolf usually performs once a
year at the Mayﬂower, but has also
been known to play on campus. His
recital this year was in Herrick last

weekend, He has also been seen
playing for several prewaltzes par.
ties. Moreover, a few years ago he
playedacollection oflounge songs in
Bob‘s underground.

difference in his performance and
would have liked to have followed
his usual pattern of preparation.
However, Student Neil Martin dis—

Dear Todd,

Even in the middle of Iowa, I
keep coming up with impediments
to financialstability. Take the ubiqr
uitous T—shirt, for example. The
other day I was in the post office,
standing in front of a table spread
wirh beautiful and meaningful T-
shirts, trying to figure out how to
scrape together seven dollars for the
one with which I was enamored. I
had already ruled out baby—sitting
(small childrenand [scare each othe
er), renting our floor space to visit—
ing alumni (I have no floor space),
and selling plasma (no plasma labs
in the area). The shirt remained
where it was.

Trshirts are one of my weak-
nesses. The Buddhist teacher who
commentedonmydetnchmentfrom
physical possessioi-s had simply not
noticed my wardrobe. Judging by
the number of organizations selling
T<shirls on this campusr it would
seem that I‘m not alone. I could buy
T—shirts for human rights. "(shirts
for speciﬁc theme pardon; shirts
commemomtinghistory. o e col:
lege, or a specific artistspoint of
view—«if I had the money. Even
withoutthe money, my storage spac-
es are already overflowing with T—
shirts. _ ,

You see, my T—sh'trts don’t go
away, even when they’re Worn or
obsolete. How could I ditch my
“Lick Bush in ‘92" T—shirrs, when I
have so many memories connected
with it? To whom would I give it?
The “MSU Lesbian/Gay Counsel
PrideWeek ‘88"T-shitt is an impor-
tant part of my history, and I helped
make it obsolete by fighting for the
counsel‘s name change. True, I new
er wear k7“ points out my age;
but how could I part with it? My
tattered army surplus T—shirts date
from a time when I had a great need
for adequate clothing. They were
there for thOW could I daert
them now?

Somewhere in my mass of T—
shirts, I have a Depeche Mode T—
shirt. It was the object of a heated
custody battle at the end of a very
odd relationship. I’m not especially
fond of Depeche Mode, but the T-
shirt seems like the best thing I got
out of the relationship. I’m keeping
it. It’s a victory banner.

Still, though I have more thana
sufficient number of T-shirts, Ihave
the urge to acquire a couple of new
ones and I posses no funds for doing
so. Hmm....Howdoesone raisefunds
at Grinnelll I could always sell T—
shirts.
