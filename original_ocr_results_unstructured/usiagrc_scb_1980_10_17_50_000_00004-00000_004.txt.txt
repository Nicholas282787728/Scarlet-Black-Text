a fly kissed my lips
whilel rode my bicycle
or should I say
my bicycle rode me?
Well anyway. . .
we exchanged gears
I pushed her pedals
squeezed her handlebars
while she supported my torso
we rode on and on
and on, on and
up hills, down valleys
through lazy straightways
cautious corners
pushed against the wind
until a fly kissed my lips
and stole my heart away.

Storying (For my Fathe

Your eyes glazed with remembering

Stare past the faded photos through

Forty years of reaching for the next rung

And climbing up the next mountainous brow,
Through forty wrinkles traced by smiles

Carved by worry and lined wiﬂi laughter

Into a clear clean time, called easy—

Then by attitudes, now by distance.

Condensed within the battered wooden binding
Years burst with smooth faced friends

Boasting bristles and brains and blondes
Sporting thin ties and baggy suim

Off “like a dirty shirt on a Saturday night"

For a raucous evening on the West side
Tomorrow morning will be dizzy with faded laughter,
But the Black Hat will open as usual at 5 am.
And the cockroachs will shovel the dishes

Past your sleep numbed fingers—reaching.

Turn the page of the photo album now.

Turn your thoughts forward from

Those good times, well worn times

Comfortable from retelling, like jeans from wear,
lroned of wrinkles from forty years of settling
Down and back with furrowed brow and faded photos.

—Beth Vilen

OZ

somewhere

over the rainbow

in emerald city

wearing ruby slippers

is a little girl

that found true happiness
along a yellow brick road

I wish
it was really that simple
