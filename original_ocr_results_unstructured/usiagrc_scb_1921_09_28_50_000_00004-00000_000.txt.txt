Comedy Will Be Given One Night
Only—«W. B. Patton and Cast
In Popular Production

"Chasing Sally", a comedy leatllrv
ing W. B. Pattonaliill lie at the Co-
lonial theater Friday night, Press
‘reports hail this comedy as something
new and different with a story that is
a real gloom chaser. The show play-
ed in New York for seven Weeks andi
made a great Success there.

As is the case with most artists, Mr.
rottop started at the bottom rung of?
the ladder and has played a Wide range
of parts. no is gifted with a [Jer-
sonaiity that few comedians possess‘
and his delightful portrayal of Felix
Fox in “Chasing Sally" is the crown
ing event of his stirring career To
his charm of person and uuaintness of
manner, and a voice which no one
who has heard could forget, it is imr
{possible to ilttlogly describe the efc
.fect that lies in his acting. There is
B. magnetism about him, refl eshing in
its cleanliness and simplicity. ivbcni
you watch him in this character, if you
care to trace it backwards from your
symptomatic side ache, you will ﬁnd
that the laugh that you laugh is at the
llaugh that Mr. Patton laughs at your
laughter. The Empire State Produc-
ing co. has taken great care in select-
ing the cast, which includes Miss Phyiv
,lls sMackay his former leading woman

Patton 5 company who have been with
him for many years and will again be
seen to advantage in the new com»
edy. Needless to say the entire pro.
duction of "Chasing Sally" will bear
the stamp of excellence which has
given w. n. Patton an enviable reputa-
itlon.
