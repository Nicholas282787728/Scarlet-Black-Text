Men’s and Women’s Cross Country
Sweep Conference Championships

By Gerald I-Ionigstock
and Katherine Fairbanks

As packs of sweaty runners, pant-
irig,exhaustedandstrainingtomain-
tain their pace, climbed the mam-
moth hill at Jones Park in Cedar
Rapids,theuninit:iatedspeciatormust
have noticed the predominance of
Grinnell runners.

The R005 and Skull Crushers each
sent their top eight runners to the
Midwest Conference meet, where
10 schools competed for the title,

Entering the race as heavy favor-
ites, both Grinnell teams did justice
to the predictions with impressive
victories.

The women. streaking across the
open startingsu-etch,quicklymoved
tothe frontof thepack of 65 runners.

IoAnne Sackett, a consistently
outstanding performer this season,
was picked to win the race.

Unfortunately, she was stricken
with an agonizing side stitch,butshe
still managed to hold her place in the
top five. With fiery determination
and blazing speed, she overtook one
runner in the last ﬁve yards,

In rapid succession, Sackett was
followed by teammates Susie Peth~
eram(7th),Christine'I'horburn(8th),
and Heidi Freiburger (10th).

The three Skull Crushers ran a
nearly perfect race, forming a pack
early in the race and helping each
other over the strenuous course.

Sandra Robinson, another solid
performer, roundw out Grinnell’s
top five with her 26th-place finish.
Close behind were Heather Lauver,
running a personal best by one and a
half minutes, Deanna Sand and Kara
Beach.

Although the Skull Cmshers had
run strong races, the results were
uncertain and it was with some trepi-
dation that they awaited the ﬁnal
scores.

TheRoos, their chests emblazoned
with the “Honor G," were never in
any doubt as to who had the best
team. Packing five runners in the top
l5, the Roos handily slaughtered the-
competition, setting a Grinnell rec-
ord of four consecutive conference
victories.

The massacre began early in the
race, as the Roos aggressively
muscled their way to the front at the
crowded start and neverrelinquished
their position. Striving for the indi-
vidual conference title, Jonathan
Lave had an off day, yet finished
3rd.

In a parallel to the women’s race,
David Sheridan, Jason Maples and
Todd Rowekamp ﬁnished 7th, 8th

Nighthawks Lose t0 Loras

By Ian Gustafson

The Grinnell Nighthawks hockey
club last weekend was relieved to
play Loras College from Dubuque
instead ofthe University orowa, as
was originally scheduled Although
Loras has more than a dozen skaters,
two goalies and a manager, and the
Nighthawks had only one extra
skater, this was a game Grinnell could
have won.

Grinnell’s chances did not look
good early on as Loras scored two
goals in the first period In the first
and second periods, Mike Jennings
had a few slapshots thatbounccd off
the Loras pipes. Loras. however,
scored three more goals to make the
score 50. At the 3:41 mark in the
third period, I ennin gs scored for the
Nighthawks unassisted. Ten min
utes later, Loras scored their last
goali And less than a minute later,
the Nighthawks ended the scoring at
6-2 when Ian Gustafson ﬂipped in
the rebound from ashot by Jennings.

Since he left the goal to play wing,
BruceJohnson has added strength to
thenghthawk offense, Dave Shane,
the talented Nighthawk goalie, fin—
ished with 25 saves in his firstgame
this year.

 

The Nighthawks will be having a
“booze cruise” for the ﬁrst time in
two years next Saturday night, Nov,
18, when they take on Joliet. Buses
and beverages will be provided for
the game, for about $4 per head.

Fencing Meet

Last Saturday, the Grinnell Fenc-
ing Club hosted its first meet of the
year. entertaining a continously
changing crowd of spectators in the
Nonh Gym, Of the 13 fencers who
came. eight were from Grinnell,
many of them new to the club.

With twoof its best fencers out for
thesemesterwithinjuries,theswash-
bucklers still performed well. Fresh-
man Nat Ward made the ﬁnal pool,
and Junior Eric Anderson and fresh-
man FritzGunnlach bothjustmissed
the cut for the championship round.
Theclub’s youngestmember,eighth4
grader Josh Bell, turned in an excel-
lent performance, winning one bout
and scoring well in several others.

In a challenging championship
round, Nat Ward took sixth place.
Third place went to Hans Nichus, a
1985 Grinnell graduate, now coach
at Scattergood Friends School.

and 10th, respectively, Maples ran a
tremendous race and Sheridan hear
his brother. who runs for Lawrence,
making his finish even sweeter,

Deserving of special mention is
Todd Rowekamp. who was racing
for thefirsttimein threeweeks. after
intense “altemative” training

In IALh place was Chris Garman,
followed closely by Mark Couch
(18th) and Nick I-Iopley (19th).
Running only his second race of the
season, Pat Heller, the final Roo
runner, ﬁnished 36th out of 69.

Inthefinal tally,theGrinnellteams
were victorious by large margins
over the “runners-up": the Skull
Crushers won by 23 points and the
R005 won by 42 points

Grinnell's double win seta prece-
dent in the Midwest Conference as
the ﬁrst-ever dual victory by one
school. Also impressive was
Grinnell‘s total of nine runners in
the top 15, all of whom earned A117
Conference honors.

Over three dozen parents, Skull
Crushers and Roos made the trip in
order to cheer the varsity runners
and watch Grinnell sweep the con-
ference titles,

An even tougher test awaits both
teams at tomorrow’s regional meet,
where 22 teams battle for a shot at
running in the national meet.
