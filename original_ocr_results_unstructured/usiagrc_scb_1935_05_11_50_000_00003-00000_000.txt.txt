With the Conierence meet but a
iew days away Coach Lester Duke
has taken on a cheriul attitude, ifw.
According to the dope Duke iigures
that Grinnell has a very good chance
oi placing among the top winners it
all oi the men come through. The
diiiiculty is that the Size oi the Squads
is limited to 15, and the lack oi
data on the southern members oi the
conterence makes the entire aiiair
somewhat or a dark horse.
. a . .

Duke reels contident that the
Grinnell runners can give two oi
the conicrence records a beating.
in iigurcs that the mile relay
team'sbonld be able to lower the
existing eonierence record in the
mile oi 3:193 which has stood
since 1918, when the University
oi nlinois set the mark. in those .
days the meet was an open aiinir.
The other record which Duke cor.
peets to ace lull is the two mile
record, hold at present by “Iron
Milka" Pilbrow, Pioneer luminary
or lormer years. Pilbrow set the
record in 1933 when he stopped the
distance in 9:33 to beat out his
own teammate Gordon who ran
in 9:37. Gordon will have his lost
crack at the record, and Duke be—
lieves that he will shatter it it this

time,

The Pioneer mile relay teams seem

lege record at the Kansas relays, This
year the quartet set the time oi 3.19.9
at that meet to shatter the previous
mark at 3:20 established in 1925 by a
Grinnell team, anchored by Morgan

Norristxperiences ‘Lively’ Adventure
With Dead Shark During Florida Trip

Works for Three Months
Obtaining shark’s
Pituitary Glands

By Stephen Viggers

Being slapped by a dead shark is
a “lively” experience to say the least,
and, according to Dr. Harry w. Nor.
ris, research proiessor oi zoology, it is
both lively and startling when totally
unexpected.

While measuring a shark which was
“reputed" to have been dead ior sev-
eral hours, Protessor Norris was sur.
prised iC discover himself suddenly
and unexpectedly lying on the beach
several ieet away irom his specimen.
The accident was caused by the re—
flex action oi the shark’s muscles
which occurred when Dr. Norris touch-
ed the dead shark's tail.

Rclurns From Florida

Dr. Norris, who has recently
returned irom a three months stay in
Florida, has been conducting investi-
gations oi the pituitary glands oi the
sharks. He did his work at the Bass
Biological Laboratories at Englewood.
Fla, where he collected between 500
and 690 specimens oi the pituitary
gland irom the various types oi shark.

The pituitary gland, which be
is investigating, is a gland located

Composition oi Lohes

A pituary gland in sharks, accord—
ing to Proiessor Norris, is composed
oi three lobes, the superior, anterior
and interior. In man the gland has
[our lobes, but they are so iused to.
gether as to make their study diffi—
cult. The research work is done with
the glands oi sharks because oi the
clearly marked divisions oi the lobes
due to the primitive nature oi the
sharks.

The product oi the gland, a rluid.
’5 distributed by the blood stream, and
in this manner is-believed to exercise
a great inﬂuence over the body
growth, both oi sharks and men.

Diitercnee in interior Lobe

All 75 varieties oi sharks have prac.
tically the same superior and anterior
lobes, stated Dr. Norris. it is in the
inierior lobe where the diiierentia—
tion between the various species is
apparent. Because oi the many varie.
ties oi pituary glands, specimens irom
many types oi sharks are needed ior
research.

The importance oi the pituary gland
has been known ior sometime, yet it
has not been until the last iive years
that much progress\has been made in
this field. AS a result oi recent re-
search, extracts of pituary glands irom
cattle are now being prescribed by
some physicians ior human disorders,
Dr, Norris revealed.
