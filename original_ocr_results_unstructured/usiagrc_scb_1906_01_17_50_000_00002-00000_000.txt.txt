We noticed a verse in the paper the

but Mother” and We could not help
but think what a good sequel that
would be to that already popular song,
“Everybody Works but Father.”

A mysterious sign which recently ap-
pealed in the New York subway read,
“You can buy most anything in this
great city but where can you ﬁnd
bees?" Under the placard some joker
has written, “Ask Charles Murphy,
he’s been stung.” That remark
sounds very much like our iriend, Mr.
Barnard oi Philadelphia, and we sur-
raise that he knows something about

SCARL Q"

A REPRESENTATIVE PAPER]

One of the LllliE'llonol'Ml arguments
which is most Ditch hurled at SCAR-
LET AND BLACK editors is that the
college paper should be representative
of the student Llorly. 33‘ that they
mean that the paper edited and con-
trolled by students should express the
Views and represent the opinions of
the undergraduates. They always
neglect to mention that the same BEF-
luas NTATKVE YAI‘ll‘lli Should he sup-
ported by at least one-half, and in re-
ality two thirds of the students. At
present less than two hundred are sub-
scxlbers although ﬁve hundred 01' more
are constant readers. In Order that
SCARLET AND BLACK may becomea
REPRESENTATIVE PAPER, the manage-
ment has inaugurated a campaign ior
subscribers. Seventy-ﬁve cents will
secure the paper, twicea week, irorn

THE CORNELLIAN HOWLS.

The editor of the Cornelliari has
been having hallucinations and ”see-
ing things at night” for several weeks
past. It all began because Grinnell
deleated Cornell in lootball; the same
as we have been doing for a decade or
so. At thattimetlieCornelllan editor

nell had always won in debate except
01108.

The next outburst came when Grin-
nell withdrew irom the State Oratori-
cal Association, and now it is bemoan-
iiig the met that Cornell has no inter-
collegiate deuate this year with Grin-
nell, but aiter making sereral unsuc-
cessful attempts to arrange debates
with other schools is compelled to de-
bate Carleton. We never knew that
Grinnell was under any obligations to
debate with Cornell and it was our
privilege to withdraw when we desired
to, although the debates with Cornell
were always interesting and exciting,
yet in a ﬁnancial way. they were a tail-
nre. The local Debating L'uion has
lost money in every Cornell debate.
For a number oi years a new system has
been under consideration and we be.
