Kaul Commentary Delights
large South lounge Crowd

by Jack Doppclt

Donal Kaul, columnist for the Des Moines Register and Tribune, treated
a sardine-packed Porum crowd Monday night to a sample oi his cynical

wit and abrasive political commentary.

Kaul, this year’s Nollen lecturer, railed at the “Charlatans, cutpurses,
and mounderbacks” who govern this country, criticizing politicians of all
persuasions for their insatiable attraction to money

Kaul who now writes his "Over the
Coffee" columns from Washington,
traced his cynicism back to 1950
when he discovered a credibility

mastered it. He recalled how Pre-
sident Eisenhower explained the
abortive U-Z mission over Russia
to the American people.

“He told us that it was a weather
recnnnaissance plane...stationed in
Turkey. The pilot had gotten stoned
on oxygen and strayed 1,500 miles
within the borders of Russia, which
is a hell of a trip no matter what
you're stoned on."

Kennedy, Johnson, Goldwater, and
McGovern did not {are well under
Kaul's scrutiny either. “But Nixon
doesn‘t lie,” Kaul explained, "he
just realized there are two sides
to every problem and it pays to be
on both sides oi them."

The columnist credited lowa with

and easygoing states, The basic

Grinnell Seniors 'Cautiously thimistic'

. by Don Dagenais

Although the job and graduate school situation
is tight throughout the country this year, Grin-
nell seniors are cautiously optimistic about their
chances or success in linding the school or yob
of their choice, an sea survey taken early this
week has revealed.

The survey, which was completed by 85 seniors,
showed that 55% of the respondents intend to
go directly into graduate school from Grinnell.
Only 40% indicated that they plan to take jobs
immediately alter graduation, and severalolthose
said that the job was only temporary until they
took up graduate sttldy.

Only 4% of those answering the questionnaire
were undecided about their futures.

Admissions

Those planning to attend graduate or pruieSSr
ional school have evidenthlly been successful
in getting accepted into the school they preier.
86% at those applying to graduate schools indie
cated that they have been accepted by at least
one school, and of those 78% said they have been
accepted by the school which is theiriirst cholCe
Only seven seniors responding tothe questionnaire
said they have been unable to obtain admission
into any graduate school

For those hoping to find jobs, however, the situav
tion is not so favorable. 55% oi the respondents
looking for a job indicated that they expect to get
the kind oi work they are looking for, while
35% indicated that they probably will not rind
the job they want. 10% are ambivalent about
their Work chances.

Jobs Vary

The types ol jobs Grinnell seniors are looking
lor vary widely, from casework tor the Civil
Service Commission to management-level yobs in
the loud processing industry to working withchil»
dren in day care centers to substitute teaching
Several seniors indicated plans to work with the
Peace Corps or VISTA, and one simple listed as
his job prelercnce “Bum.”

Medical school and law school, as expected, are
most popular among those planning postgraduate
work. 42% or those going into iurther study
are going into one oi those two holds, with the

division exactly evens~21% into each. Next in
popularity among those responding to the survey
is business school (10%), lollcwed by graduate

school in English (8%), Library Science (5%),
Theatre (5%) and Chemistry (5%).

The types of graduate schools seniors will be
entering vary widely throughout the range, how
ever, including Public Affairs. Oceanography,
Speech Pathology, and Entomology.

Away from Grinnell

Several respondents indicated a desire to get
completely away from academic atmosphere olthe
college. One senior, who did not list any job
preference, simply said she wanted “something
fun.” Others indicated that they planned to travel
for awhile belore settling down to anything per-
manent

A low seniors, however, indicated thattheywere
having delinite problems finding the jobs they
wanted "Everybody I talk to seems to indicate
things are really tight,” said one respondent.
“It's not how good you are, but who you know.”

Said another, “It seems to me that grad school
opportunities are much better than jobs,” And
another: “The job situation is really tight.” One
senior, who indicated that she could probably
get no better than a typing job, said that ”the
job situation is by no means ideal. I have circled
what l'll get Stuck with.”

Several Students could only write the word
”dismal" when asked about their job prospects
and another, in desperation, Just scrawled
“HELP!” across the questionnaire.

> Budget Cuts

Although not pessimistic about the chances oi
being accepted, those going to graduate or pro-
fessional school frequently complained about
the scholarship and loan situation. One senior
termed the scholarship situation “extremely
dim " Others mentioned that the recent “attack

. on funds" by the Nixon administration is hurting

the schools' ability to grant financial aid,

As a iinal note, several seniors commented
that Gl‘innell's Career Services Office was not
helpful where the job situation was concerned,
and voiced the need for a Stronger service for
graduating seniors.
