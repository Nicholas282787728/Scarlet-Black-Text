the phosphate entering surface

Most of this comes from the

386 pounds of recyclable pa

a minimum of $25 to$30 more
a week for trash disposal--
a 10-15% increase.

The various research teams
within LEAP hit a number of
snags in their data collect-
ing. For instance, finding out
the number of student cars on
campus proved nearly impos-
sible.

Only nine cars were regis-
tered through the Dean of
Students-which is thus the
"official" number of student
cars. But at 5 a.m. onDecem»

sion revealed 80 cars with

total, based on a survey of
student travel means, stands
at 150 student cars.

dorm.

Their finding was that "the
lower thermostat setting did
not result in lower tempera-
tures to a significant degree.
8&0 said there was nothing
which they could do about the
situation.” Without [herrnOr
stat changes, however, dorm
temperatures were found to
range from 63 to 78 degrees.

Another problem encounr
ered was lack of cooperation

turers concerning chemical

RE‘NEE, SONJA and STEVE MOHR

Triple Threat RA’s:
Steve, Sonia, Renee

by Laurie Hultberg

What did Steve Mohr, resir
dent adviser in Cleveland, ex-
pect his job to be when he
accepted last year?

"Actually, I had no idea, be-
cause Dean Low and Dean
Kimbo had no definite ideas."

Steve, his wife Renee, and
their baby daughter Sonja
compose one ofjust two three-
member RA teams on campus.
(The Tedermans are the other
triple threat.) Steve, an or-
dained minister, received his
masters from the Christian
Theologiml Seminary in ln‘
dianapolis last June. While in
the seminary,he wasassistant
to the dean of students and
became interested in working
with students.

One of Steve'sprofessors in-
formed him ofthe RAprogram
at Grinnell and mentioned that
mere were openingsavailable.
Steve wrote Dean Low, waded
through [hejedriape jungle of
applying, and was accepted.
Steve, who says, “I enjoy
being innovative," thought the
job soundedfull: “We received
one description which said
that we would be counseling
with students, livingin dorms,

Wickersham Says Four ICBM
Officers Could Destroy World

Dr. Bill Wickersham stated
Tuesday that the end of the
world could be brought on by
a single irrational act by four
people.

Wickersham, National Field
Director for the World Feds
eraIists, U.S.A., pointedoutto
a .Grinnell audience that fire
ing mechanisms for the Min‘
uteman missles could beacti»
vated by a simple collaborar
tion of four fire control offie
cers, irrespective of the de-
sires of theirsuperiors, since
each Minuteman site is essen-
tially independent from all
others. Wickersham pointed
out that a single ICBM thus
launched could trigger World
War III.

Wickersham followed Tues-
day's A.R.H. discussion ofthe
precarious condition of the
nuclear arms situation with a
brief film entitIEd “Hiroshi-
ma~Nagasaki," to make clear
the point that the world in whe
ich we live hangs in an un-
stable balance betweena frenr
Zied peace and total destrucr
tion.

Wickersham represents the
World Federalists, an as'
sociation dedicated to theach-
ievement of"WorldPeaceTh*
rough World Law." Since
1945, World Federalists have
been engaged in campaigns to
educate Americans to the horr
rors of the nuclear apocalye
pse. World Federalists also
maintain a registered lobby in

Washington and representa-
tion in the U.N.

Wickersham borrowed Ash-
ley Montague's term “tribal-
ism” to describe the world
community’s mind-set of “a,
tlonalism and international
competition. He stated the
World Federalist belief that
such attitudes must be rapid
1y modified if the world com-
munity is to remain in exis-
tence.

In a South Lounge discussion
Wednesday night, Wickersham
expressed an underlyingpes
simism when confronted with
the question of whether or not
he felt his efforts and those of
Other World Federalists could
indeed change what might
seem to many to be a human
nature oriented toward vio-
lence and destruction. How»
ever, he expressed a simul"
taneous optimism and belief
that such efforts were neces»
sary and mustbe made, rather
than abandoning the alternar
tive of peace as a viable goal
of mankind.

On the theory that today’s
students will become tomor-
row's leaders, Wickersham
presented a four-point prog-
ram to reorient the thinking
of his Grinnell audience. He
stated the desirability of de—
claring the College a “world
college” that would proclaim
itself "a part of the world
territory." To support this

tive and academic interns."

What is an RA'S job really
like? "Hectic and enjoyable,"
is Steve’s first reaction. In
addition to counseling in his
dorm, Steve works in the Plan
cement Office helping Ray
Obermiller interpret the
Strong interest Test, and he
is available to help in the Fin-
ancial Aid Office. Reneeworks
with the Crisis Center and
participates in student actir
vities, while Sonja holds down
the home front.

Steve, commenting on theRA
program and its future, noted
that students are often reluc-
tant toapproachan RA because
of the RA's ties with the ad-
ministration. He wishes that
these negative associations
could be eliminated, and in-
dicated that some new plans
are being formulated in re-
gard to the RA program. He
was unable to comment on
particulars in the plan, how-
ever.

Although Steve was hesitant
to give opinions about the Gr-
innell community because of
his brief experience here so
far, he seemed to feel that
peer group pressure is ex-
cessive concerning drugs,
sex, dress, andstudying. Still,
he intends to withhold judges
ment until he has more fully
explored that nebulous entity
called the "Grinnell Exper-
ience."

.I.E. Muiner Plays
In lounge Saturday

This Saturday night, J.E.
Mainer and his Crazy Mounr
taineers will be performing
in the North Lounge of the
Forum. J.E., who plays the
fiddle and the banjo (not to
forget the Jew‘s harpl), plays
in the style of pre-bluegrass
music. He now has a blue—
grass banjoist, who slightly
changes the style of their
music, which has been around
since the 1930's.

J.E. and his original band
have been playing country mu-
sic since the Depression days
and he has put out a number
of now historic recordings,
such as the "Classic Maple
on the Hill." He played with
such notables as the Morris
Brothers (Wiley and Zeke),
who originally played "The
Salty Dog Blues."

J.E. has toured all over the
South, and recently, with the
folk revival, has played at a
number of Northern and West
Coast festivals. Many of his
old songs have been re-rer
corded on the "Old Timey"
label, while now he records
on the "Rural Rhythm" label.
His band, The Crazy Mounr
taineers, also consists ofa
guitar and bass along with
J.E’s fiddle and banjo.
