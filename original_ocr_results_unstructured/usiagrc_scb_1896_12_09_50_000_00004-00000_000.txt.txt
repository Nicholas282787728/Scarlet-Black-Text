Chicago's Claims.

In view of the existing contlt
tion of football matters all lull: of
thc wester n cliampinnsliipis r other
tiresome. Chicago's claim rs like
an ovel burdened fruit tleeincctls
something ro prop it up. wis-
cnnsrn seems to hive much the
better of the argument. "Chica-
go bases her claim on the fact
that the team that was beaten by
Wisconsin was not the same team
that beat Northwestern is to 6.
anti later Michigan 7 to o," If
this is the only foundation Chicar
go has tor her claim. she is build—
ing upon sinking sand, Grant
that it was not the same team, it
was the one that represented the
University at the time and it was
the best the University could then
produce. Chicago has not played
Wisconsin since that defeat and
there is some slight reason for
supposing that Wisconsin's team
also is not the same one that it
was then. The only way oi
settling the matter would have
been a game between Chicago and
Wisconsin. So the championship
question is still open. If such
arguments as the above are to be

allowed, all that a defeated team
will have to do. in the tutrue. will
be to wait until a lewgood men
grow up and enter her ranks or-
until all the good men of other
teams die. Then two or three
other teams can be defeated and
the claim set up that this victori
ous team is not the same as the
one that was previously defeated.
Chicago's arguments do not hold
water.7U. r/M. Daily.

At Princeton a practice of
strengtheningtheanklesandknees
of each member of the eleven by
adhesive plaster and elastic bands
is round valuable in daily practice.
It cannot \vhnlly prevent strains
and \vrcnchcd knees. but makes
the chances oi serious injury very
small.
