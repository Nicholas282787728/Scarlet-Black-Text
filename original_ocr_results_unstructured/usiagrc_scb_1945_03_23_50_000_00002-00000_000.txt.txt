Vacation Days? - -

When the college announced cancellation
of its spring vacation several weeks ago,
students applauded the action. Unlike
students in most otller colleges in which
such action was taken, we were given no
voice in the matter, but our vote would
probably have agreed with the adminis—
tration decision.

We feel that the reason for vacation
cancellation is a good one. The request
of the CDT that students refrain from mass
migrations this spring would not have been
made unless the transportation facilities of
the country were beillg badly strained
Transfer of troops and wounded men is
taxing these facilities to the limit.

When the vacation was cancelled, fac-
ulty members recognized the need of the
students for some kind of ‘ivacation,"
probably on campus. Finally a plan was
evolved. The students would be given a
vacation all right . two days of it .
with members of all classes in college re—
quired to take three hour exams on those
days.

. That is not our idea of a vacation.
Although we are blithely assured that “no
preparation is necessary” for the testing
program, we object strongly to the strain
of being tested for three hours a day for
two days just to test the test, as is being
done in some cases . . . Or, if we cooperate
in such a program, as we would be glad to
do under normal circumstances, we object
to having to take what spring vacation is
granted us to do so. -

We suggest that in the interests of
student morale we be given two days va-
cation . . . two Saturdays or a Saturday
and the following Monday, without tests
to interrupt the blessed relief of a long
weekend free from academics. Naturally,
no out-of»town permissions could be granted
for this weekend, or the purpose of can-
celling the original spring vacation would
be defeated.

If held on a Saturday and the follow
ing Monday, the vacation would not cut into
the same classes, as it would if it were held
on two Saturdays, and therefore we feel
that the Saturday-Monday plan is a better
one

Plans for the proposed days should be

Ring Out The Old - - i‘ 3

For many months the upperclassmen have,
felt that the cut system on campus is ill
dire need of revision, The system at pres,
ent provides for as‘ many unexcused cuts}
as the number of hours credit received illl
that col so. This seems to us to be an odd}
restriction to place upon the student whom
college is supposed to teach initiative and

When a student completes his freshman]
year, he is purportedly adjusted to the
ways of college life and should be able tol
judge for himself how to use his time to‘
the best advantage. Surely this person, if al
superior student, should not be hampered
by a regulation limiting his class cuts, if he
can further his education by being absent:
from this class a few more times than ale
lowed.

l
Iowa State Teachers college has ill op
eration a system of optional attendance. Its
regulations provide that any non-freshman
student with a grade average of B or better
in the department in‘ which he desires ope
tional attendance is eligible He need only
fill out a blank secured at the registrar’s
office listing the courses he has taken in
that department and the grades he received
in them. The blank must be presented to
his instructor within the first five days of
the term. If the instructor grants the re-
quest, the student is required to attend only
the first’and last five days of the term,
with the exception of examination days,

Such a provision as this, we feel, would
be more acceptable on our campus than our
present strictly defined regulations, Good
students who are in advance of their clas—
ses would be permitted to cut in order to
pursue other study. The acquisition of op
tional attendance places a great responsie
bility upon the studentithe responsibility
of wise use of that time to broaden his
interests and accumulate knowledge.

The faculty will no doubt object to this'
plan on the grounds that the student will.
never attend class if not required to do so.
This is not usually the case, however, when
superior students only—those capable of
exercising good judgmentrare eligible for
optional attendance. In fact, the plan ap-
pears to be functioning almost too smoothly
at Iowa State Teachers college, for the
students are now being urged to make use
of the provision. 1

Optional attendance is an unusual privv
ilege enabling students to take the initia-
tive and study on their own. The limited
cut system has outwom its usefulness on
this campus. It is a hindrance to the sll»‘
perior scholar and should, for his benefit,
be replaced by a more up-to—date system,
modelled to fit the needs of the individual,

Humanities Work”
§To Be Combined
lWiih English Dept.

l Students Can Take
‘ Same Program; Only
Slight Course Change

The executive council of the
college, made up at the dlviswna]
chairmen, Friday voted to merge
the work in General Humanities
.wiLh that in English, beginning
next year, Paul Spencer Wood,
chairman of the language de-
partment, announced today.

The department will be called
English and Comparative Litere
,eture and will include besides
the regular courses in English
and American literature, several
courses in which foreign classics
will be studied‘ in translation.
Thus it will be possible for stu»
dents to take the same‘ program
of studies now described as con-
centration In General Humanities
and still meet the regular college
requirements for a field of con-
l centratlon.

Under the new plan there will
be three kinds of concentration
in English, each of which will
prepare the student for a dit-
ter‘ent comprehensive examiner
tion: 1, the usual English pro-
l gram emphasizing the history of
English and American literature:
l2, the usual English and joumae
ll‘sm program emphasizing jour-
lnalism and a nonhistorical study
lof li rature; 3, the present Hu~
lmauitles program emphasizing
comparative literature.

The merger will thus include
everything now open to students
concentrating either in English
or in General Humanities, and it
wiLl give new flexibility to minor
or supporting work in literature.
,The same courses will be given
as usual, except that the three
one semester courses in Greek,
Latin, and Italian classics in
:translation will be consolidated
llnto one full year course, either
’semester of which may be taken
separately.
