Town library to expand

BY KENDALL HIEDEMAN &,
STEPHANIE NORDSTROM

When someone walks into the Stewart Lit
brary, they are met by bookshelves spaced int
credibly close together. with books piled high
on top of them. “We're terribly. terribly crowdr
edihave been, actually, for a number of years,"
said Lorna Caulkins, director of the Stewart
Library. That will soon change, because the
city of Grinnell will break ground on a new
library rn March 2008.

While most Grinnell students are referring
to Biirling when they talk about the library,“
there rs another library in town that serves both
members of town and the college. Although it
may only be about 10,000 square feet, as com-
pared to 60,739 square feet for Burling, Stew-
art Library offers a collection which appeals to
some of the college’s students.

Their reasons for walking downtown to
the Stewart Library instead of heading to Bur»
ling vary. Often, students trek to the Stewart
Library to check out the fiction section, to per
ruse the children’s books or to ﬁnd a book for
class workr“One speciﬁc reason [that students
come] is that students in education classes use
our children’s section here, which is, of course,
not awrilable at Burling,” said Caulkins. She
noted that the library tries to “complement,
rather than duplreate"Burhrrg.

Emily Wax ’09 has had a Stewart Library
card since fall of her freshman year. She en—
joys the children's section in the basement of
the building, “complete with two parakeets,

named, I think, Ginny and Hermione," said
Wat “Ginny hit me on the ringcr once."

The new library will be built on the core
net of Park Street and Fifth AvenueTo show
support {or the library and the town, Grinnell
college donated part of the site.

With only limited space available the lit
braiy has had to fit more books into a small
space then they would like. “We’ve had to
shuffle our space around and use every inch or
space," caulkins said. When the new building
rs completed in fall 2009, it will be over 26,000
square feet, more than double the present size.

Another new feature may appeal to
Grinnell College’s students. Caulkiris said one
of the most exciting aspects ofthc new build-
ing will be the number of green features. “We
are aiming for Leadership in Envrronmental
and Energy Design (LEED) certification,"
Caulkins said.

According to caulkins, the initial estimate
for the cost of the new library was 37.8 mile
lion, but the addition ofgreen features has int
creased that price by 81 million. In the long
term, however, this will bring benefits. “The
geothermal heating and cooling system will
save a lot of money, and rnaxlmizrng use of
natural light will save a lot ormoney,"caulkins
said.

For those students and town residents
who like the old building, they need not worry
about what will happen to the sitetThe build-
ing will not be torn down and will remain a
public building in some capacity.

You’ve interviewed a lot of Soviet politic
cians like Mikhail Gorbachev and BorisYeltv
sin. What is it like interviewing them? How
do you get Boris Yeltsin to warm up to you.)

Well, it's always a trick, particularly with a
head'of state, because a lot of them tend to be
veryscripted but I gotta say Yeltsin, the mat
ment 1 had an interview with him was just as
he was the president of the Russia. The Soviet
Union had _lust collapsed, I mean literally Gore
bachcv moved out the next day. so he was on a
high And Yeltsin loved to talk.

Can you talka little bit abouthow you got
expelled from the Soviet Union in 1982?

Well in those days, ityon were a Western
correspondent, you were very controlled \ou
could only live m certain housing which you
knew were monitorediyou literally had bugs

guys it was a situation where it was assumed
that every Western journalist was a spy, that
you had to be disciplined as much as possible.

The perfect Western journalist for them
was someone who did not speak Russian,who
sat in his office and took the government news
agency copy and sort of rewrote it for the home
ofﬁce and took no initiative.

My feeling on the job was that you had
to go out and try and report as much as you
worrld in any other society- treat it as a normal
story even though it was not a normal country
and push as far as you could.

They began dropping the unsubtle hints:
slashing my tires, increasing my surveillance,
making it very overt, you know, they could folr
low you without you knowing or they could
follow you so it was very visible that was
the main point: to intimidate Russians from
talking to you. In those days. in went to some
provincial town, chances were I was the ﬁrst
American journalist people had seen, maybe
even the first American people had seen and
so even though there was the Cold War atmot
sphere and there was propaganda against the
United States, there was real curiosity

When you got kicked out, did you feel
righteous, like, “I’m doing such a good job
they kicked me outl" or were you shcepish
because you went so far you couldn't do your
job at all anymore?

A.fr’ id orrninc told me early on, “Ifyou
keep wi g these stories, they'll give you a
year " Because wrrhin a year, most people get
the message that a little selftcensorship is a
good thing. so 1 knew it was always a possit
bility. And I was kicked out after 14 months,
so he was pretty accurate. Bill orcontse l was
disappointed because it was so difficult to opr
mate in that society that you felt such a s
ot’ satisfaction when you did get real stories

and you did feel you were writing something
that other people weren't writing but on the
other hand, when I was expelled it was a big
story in itself . .. and it suddenly brought a lot
of attention to the stories I had been writing
.. I felt frustrated when I left to be out aftlrat
story.

Balm/t Obama.

How was it traveling with Hillary and
Obama?

That was the first time that she brought in
Bill, ofﬁcially And it was the ﬁrst time I saw
Ohama together with Michelle and the two
children, campaigning all together. Briefly, in
Illinois when he announced, they were togeth—
er, but this was the first time really campaign-
ing We called it "Dueling Family" politics.

What did you think of the small town
stops, like Hillary talking to a few dozen
people in a eoFFee shop?

The thing for me at least. for Foreign me
dia at least there is just no acceptance, they
are scheduled so rightly that I applied several

times to talk with

Obama but

you know, very ‘

friendly answer

but no. But when

I come here,I can

shake hands, chat with him, he will even take
a picture with me.

can you just say you're an Iowan and ask
him a few questions that way?

Ja,j'a, I have. But even at those campaign
stops in Iowa, there is a little place where media
is supposed to be and the campaign does not
like it when journalists jump the lines because
they say, “You have your time to ask questions,
now he is here to meet the people."

The second time, he recognized me, “I
havc already had a picture with youl" and I
said, “Ja,j'a you havc."ButI rcll hiur I am writ-
ing a biography about him and I have to send
the manuscript in two weeks.

How have you been doing research for
that?

I write a biography which is a mixture of
stops where I have seen him and blogrllphr
cal information and people who have done the
work with him, community organizers on the
South Side, on Sunday I will go to this church
in Chicago and talk to his reverend.

It's not so dimcult to get the inrornratrorr,
but there are sonic troublcs with accuracy. just
try to find out about his African halftsisters
and brothers. According to Internet, he has six,
according to the new biography by a Chicago
Tribune reportei,he has nine and I count read
ing Obama’s books that he has eight. And I
call to the campaign and they say, "You won't
get the information from rrs. Good lrrck, but
we don't know it. "

So what number are you going to use?

Iwill, at the numberr court to accor rig
to teat ing his memoirs, and that is the r t dlc
number. eight children.
