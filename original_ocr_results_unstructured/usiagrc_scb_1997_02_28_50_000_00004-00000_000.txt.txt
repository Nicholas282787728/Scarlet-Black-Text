Erin Childress

It is much easier to criticize than to
support. I could easily tell you that
SGA is useless and in desperate need
ofrevitalization. With my experience
as the SGA All-Campus Events Pro-
g-rarnmer this year, the GEAR coorA
dirtator for two years, a Hall Social
Coordinator my sophomore year, and
a member of the Student Develop-
ment Conunittee, my credibility level
as a candidate “for change" would be
high. However, once you looked at
the real accomplishments of SGA the
past two years, I would lose that cred-
ibility immediately, The truth is, SGA,
and the self-govemance system it en-
compasses. is effective when used
correctly. We don’t need radical

change: next year — we need to con- .

tinue to build on the radical accom-
plirhments of SGA,

The role of the SGA President is far
from arebellious leader. Instead, the
SGA president must be an excellent
communicator, an effective mediator,
and a dedicated student advocate. As
President, my primary role would not
only be to facilitate effective discus-
sion and action in the Cabinet and
Ioint Board, but also to represent your
concems and goals to the administra-
tion, the alumni, the town, and the

(

 

Trustees.

I firmly believe that initiative should
rise from the student body itself; the
SGA Cabinet, led by the President,
should set the tone and structure in
which those initiatives can have the
most salient voice. This year. SGA
took an active role in supporting the
quest for multicultural and organiza
tional space. An unfaltering commit
ment to seeing the completion and
implementation of those plans should
be of utmost importance. At this criti-
cal point in the 5 yearquest for space,
it is vital that those assuming office
not start at ground zero, learning the
facts which those already involved in
the issue know. Second, the rebirth of
Common Ground has opened new avr
enues for networking among student
organizations, The space rally and
petition are perfect examples of the
success which organization among
groups can bring. We need to con-
tinually increase those lines of com-
munication. Finally, JointBoard must
continue to be an open forum for stu~
dent expression. This year, when
important issues, such as smoking in
public areas. arose, the Senators felt
compelled to actively solicit the views
of their constituents, refusing to cast
a vote until this consultation was com-

plete Above ‘all, informed votes must
continually be encouraged on every
issue

For the responsibility and honor of
SGA President, I am eittircly capable
and extremely wellrpreparcd. As
ACE Programmer, I inherited a basin
Cally wonhless student initiative sys
tem. lrevitalized that system, finally
making initiatives a highly effective
tool for student expreSSlon, By chair—
ing the ACE Committee, supervising
the Films and Concerts Chairs, and
organizing GEAR, a large and active
student organization, for 2 years, I
have developed my leadership, comr
municalion, and organizational skills.
Above all else, these experiences have
taught me the importance of teamr
work. SGA is not an organization
which functions on the work and inr
sights of a few individuals. Instead, it
is the centerof asystem of governance
which facilitates an active, opinionr
ated, intellectual, and sometimes at
odds community. I understand that
role, I respect that role, and I want to
serve you in that role.

Please vote on Wednesday; March 5
1997.

Sincerely,
Erin E. Childress, ‘98

 

' Jeetander Dulani

My name is Jeetander Dulani and I
am running for the ofﬁce of SGA
President. I am 'a Junior political sci-
ence major and have extensive expe-
rience with SGA, campus organiza-
tions, and student affairs. I served as
President of Amnesty International
my first two years at Grinnell. I also
worked with SGA as the senator for
Haines 'l-iall second semester fresh»
man year. Last year I served as an
SA for Haines Hall. Each of these
experiences enhanced my knowledge
of self governance and leadership.
They also convinced me that leader-
ship means standing up to authority
and challenging those you work with
to do their best.

The bottom line is that SGA needs
to change its philosophy. As you sit
here reading this, I ask you, how has
SGA changed your life this past year?
Undoubtedly, you heard, or possibly
took part in, the numerous protests
that occurred last semester (the GUM

ad, smoking rights or lack i.hereofin_

the forum, multircultui‘al space).
What you may not be aware of is that
each time a member ofjoint board or
the cabinet raised questions about
such a contentious issue or asked that
members be permitted to debate what
the rest of campus was discussing; the
matter was tabled. In speaking to
members of the current cabinet, as
well as senators. the philosophy of the
current administration seems to be
one of safety and meekness.

SGA needs to redeﬁne itself as an
organization that deals with issues
(contentious or innocuous) not just

through listening and debate, but by
proposing solutions and taking those
proposals to both the administration
and the students. There will be dis-
agreement and conﬂict as SGA de-
bates issues because many issues on
this campus are divisive. However,
once those issues havebeen explored,
Joint Board should be expected to
work on solutions. This means mak
ing difﬁcult decisions, and perhaps
disagreeing with the administration,
but since SGA is the voice of cam-
pus its members must not back down.
The rash of student protests indicates
that a sizable part of campus doesnot
feel that the current method of deal-
ing with thingsiseffective. There are
a number of ideas that I think would
enhance student life.

The ﬁrst would he an implemenr
tation ofan Honor Code. This would
encompass many of the attributes out-
lined within the academic honesty
requirements and self governance. It
would extend those concepts so that
students would have an increased de-
gree of both freedom and responsi»
bility. One area where this would be
most evident would be exams. An
honor code would allow students to
complete written examinations ac
cording to their own schedules. Stu~
dents would sign out exams and have
three hours to complete them any-
where on campus. The result would
be less stress during midsems and ﬁ-
rials.

Another proposal which I feel
should be considered is converting
1221 Park St. into interim office space
for those multicultural groups which

at present do not have space. I men.
tion 1221 because it has not been used
as an off campus house this year.
Since there has not been an over-
whelming shortage of off campus
housing even with large senior and
junior classes; and since future classes
are not expected to approach the size
of this year’s juniors and seniors it
seems that the college can afford to
maintain the current situation by air
lowing multi-cultural groups to use

1221 as temporary office space.

Athird proposal which I feel would
enhance student life would be inr
creased funding for SPARC. In light
of last semesters controversy over the
ad in the GUM and allegations ofedi-
torial misconduct some of you may
be wondering why SPARC needs
more money. There are two advan-
tages to increased funding. 1) Im-
provrng the quality of campus publi-
cation, 2) Forcing SPARC to improve
its leadership, by connecting more
funding to reforms that demand re-
sponsible use of editorial power.

In the end the SGA President shapes
the philosophy by which SGA gov-
ems. By making SGA responsible for
solutions, things Will change on this
campus. You, the students, will have
delivered a mandate that will ensure
SGA does more than provide week
end films and concerts. SGA must
become the center of change on cam
pus to make self governance work.

Thank You.

Qualifications: An open mind.
Joint Board senator (off-campus
housing) fall ‘95. Model United
Nations, Mock Trial. Afterrschool
art program, Grinnell Middle
School.. KDIC. S&B Fall ‘94. El
cetera.

My platform is basically centered
in the belief that student government
should be accessible and fair. The
ideal of self-governance should be
maintained as the primary goal of
SGA and its members. This cam-
pus has so many resources. What
bothers me is that they are not being
used by a large percentage of the stua
dent population. This is because so
many students feel alienated in part
by an indirect and restrictive self»
governance process. As president of
the SGA, I would have the power to
change that. And I fully intend to.
As we all know, so many Grinnell
students have good ideas. Here are
a few of mine:
~Open Campus discourse. In the
classroom, in the dining hall, in the
Forum. One of the fundamental
problems on this campus is a symp-
tom of underrepresentation of ideas
within the student body as a whole.
I would like to see an open and di-

rect debate on real campus issues in
an informal setting so that more
points of view can be represented
without intimidation. I would rec-
ommend an informal meeting run by
student volunteers a few times a
week in the Forum next year so that
issues can be discussed in an open
setting.

#Letls create more interest and in
volvement in campus media. I would
like to see a more suitable selection
of student publications. We should
strive to support creative endeavors
that often get overlooked such as
filmmaking andstudentartopenings.
—Efficient use of existing campus
resources rs extremely important.
The Harris Center and Gardner
Lounge could be used more crer
atively, for instance. These cites
could he developed in order to offer
a more diverse selection ofthrngs to
do.

7We need to ﬁnd a way for smok-
ers and nonsmokers to coexrst
peacefully, The problems ofsecond-
hand smoke are material for non-
smokers. However, smokers com-
prise a sizeable portion of the stu-
dent body and should not feel ex-
cluded from ccniral campus. There
are better Solutions, If the smell of

smoke is a problem, then air puriﬁr
ers could certainly help. In no way
does banning smoking in the “can
pus living room" seem fair.
rSGA needs to follow through.
This extends to issues such as space,
multiculturalism and smoking. The
leaders ofSGA need to be attuned to
student needs and offer an avenue for
change instead of empty promises.
The ball cannot be dropped on these
issues next year and changes sup
ported by the studenthody should be
made as efficiently and quickly as
possible These issues constitute a
real, dayrtorday problem for many
Grinnell students and necessitate a
strong SGA for action.

——We, the Grinnell student body,
need to continue a tradition ofopenr
ness and understanding by fﬂcllllmr
ing discusstons of our similarities
and differences in culture and point-
ofrview, No group or individual
should have to feel misunderstood on
this campus.

Let me know if you have any more
ideas, [want to hear what you think.
Really.

BY RUPIN THAKKAR
SGA President

In the SGA minutes this year the
abbreviation CSL is mentioned mul»
tiple times. You undoubtedly noticed
that it was the CSL who proposed to
ban smoking in the Forum, reorga-
nize the Hall Council, and extend the
hours of the Treasurer's Office, You
may be wondering what the CSL is
and why it is making these contrOr
versial proposals to SGA.

The Committee on Student Life
is comprised ofscvcn students, a fac»

ulty member, the Director of thc '

Physical Plant, the Dean of Student
Affalrs, and the Associate Dean of
Student Affairs. The seven students
include the SGA President, two sena-
tors and four students appointed by
the‘ SGA President through a selec-
tion process. This committee is re-

Self—govemance according to Pam?

sponsrhlc for continuing review and
initiating changes in all ol the
college's social policies, sludcnl serr
Vices, and facilities. All CSL rcc-
ominendatrons must be npprovctl
first by SGA and then by the Presir
dent ofthe College before they can
be implemented, Further, SGA can
amend the proposal before sending
it to the President

The next question you may have
is how we can consider the students
on this campus to have sclllgovcr-
nance ifthc buck stops with the Col-
lege Presidcnt. This is Simply bcr
cause President Ferguson, like her
predecessors and the college‘s other
administrators, has n'slrong respect
for SGA and self-governance. Un-
less tlie students give her an outri-
geous or illegal proposal. she is more
than likely to support our decision

SGA and its associated commit-
tees can bc powerful institutions if

used correctly by the student body,
Although iii previous years SGA
seemed to do little other than stamp
budget proposals, in the last two
yeals wc have i'edlsctlvcrcd the on
pnrtunitics that we have. At most
schools students do not have the op-
portunities to propose significant
changes in policles and facilities, or
to lobby the trustees for building
projects, or even to book the films
and concerts they get on campus.

Scott you will have the chance to
volt: for the studcnt you would like
to fulfill my Job ncxt year As you
question or meet With the various
candidates. remember that it is not
so important how these candidates
1'ch about the issues as it is how they
plan to facilitate discussion on the
issues and hpr you find solutions to
the concerns that at most schools
only administrators are allowed to
solve.

 

 

 

A few suggestions for the Forum

BY ANDY WEIDNER
Edito’r-inLCliicr “ '

In light of the recent Jomt Board
decision to approve money to fix the
ventilation system in both sunrooms
of the Forum to accommodate smok-
ers, I have a few suggestions for the
Joint Board to consrder,

1. Install a wet bar in North
Lounge staffed by a fullrtime, certir
fied bartender. This_would accomr
modate those of quLlSt itching for a
martini. It is simply asking too much
to require drinkers to walk the dis
tance to Rabbitt's or the Pub for a
quick nip between classes,

2. Replace thc table and chairs in
PDRVB with louligc furniture, wall
hangings, ti black light and a vend-
