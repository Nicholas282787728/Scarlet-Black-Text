Junior Varsity athletics at Grinnell explored

Where does the emphasis lie.

by Jeff Raymond

Coach Bob Bengel's men's junior varisty
basketballers beat Vennard College 17-43
last Monday in Darby Gym to move their
record to 3-4 for one year. Bengel lauded
the team's recent deiensive play and said
that he was pleased with the overall peiu
formance of the J V. team. Only three
games remain on the team's lO-game
schedule and the sole‘ home game is this
Tuesday at 5:15 pm against Cue prior to
the varsity contest.

The philosophy behind the junior varsity
squad is to give some of the many Grinnell
students who enjoy basketball but aren't
quite varsity material a chance to play
organized basketball. The loosely strucs
tured club team also serves this purpose,
Bengal said that the J V. team has not
traditionally served to develop players to
compete at the varsity level. although he
said that some players on this year's team
may well be able to challenge for spots on
iuture varsity squads The varsity and
J v. teams do not even practice together.
which means one J.V. group must put on
practice until 7 p m.. after the varsity has
lelt the gym.

The men’s soccer junior varsity team
has the same philosophy oi providing an
avenue or competition for those players
with less than varsity level skills. but they
do not split the practices. Soccer Coach
and Athletic Director John Plitsch said
that he would prefer to conduct separate

practices but the funds and iacilities need-
ed [or another coach alld field are not easr
1y available As in the basketball program.
the soccer J.V. uses players who would not
see playing time on the varsity and pro
vides them with game experience Pittsch
ielt that even more players would come
out lor soccer ii the junior varsity was able
to practice separately. He said of the com»
bined practices. "I'm not particularly hapa
py with the way we do it now "

Junior varsity soccer players irenuently
have trouble moving up to varsity level
competition and only a tcw each year are
able to make the switch Part of the pro-
blem, according to Plitsch. is that soccer
is such a quickly expanding sport that each
year's freshman class is quite a bit better
than the previous one and these players
are stepping into varsity spots that J v
players might have inherited. Thus. the
longer a player stays at the junior level.
the less chance he has oi moving up

Sarah Brichlord allowed her to split the

liowedder brought up a point that
l’lilsch later echoed concerning schedule
ing problems [or the iv, teams.
Specifically. many schools that Gl'iniiell
competes against are cutting back iinan-
cially and dropping J v. squads in their
athletic departments Pfitsch said that
unless he added independent soccer clubs
tohis J v, schedule in the near iuturc. hc
would notbe able to allow the team to play
more than the live games they played this
year

In contrast to most of the J v. programs
here. the football teams squad is designed
specifically tor training players lor varsity
competition The junior varSity practices
with the varsity team and most J.V.
players dress lor the varsity games Coach
Will Freeman. who is in charge of the J.V.
football squad. said that the size of a toot-
ball team and the occurrence ot injuries
throughout the season makes the junior
varsity program important iorthe varsity.
He pointed to iactors such as a J.V. player
receivmg the team's most improved
player award and the team's perfect 3-0
record this season as evidence of the sues
cess oi the J v. program Freeman cons
ceded that some schools don't have the
money to support a J.V team or a lengthy
J.V. schedule but said that iinding op-
ponents was not a big problem
