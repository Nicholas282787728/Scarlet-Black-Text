Says Rapid Survey Leaves
One Unsatisfied; Gives
Praise to Zorach.

By Henry Alden.

The exhibit of American water
colors from the permanent collec-
tion of the Brooklyn Museum in
Brooklyn, N. Y., that is now on
view in Main hall is likely to
prove disappointing to the casual
spectator. To begin with, the
pictures are for the most part
small and the coloring is dulleri
not with the delicate fragility of
some water color work, but ac-
tually dullerithan one‘ expects
water colors to be. They are lost
in the vast hall where they are
displayed; they are overshadowed
by the massive furniture that
surrounds them; one can imagine
them pleading in thin, wailing
voices for a small room and bare
white walls to set off their subtle
tones.

.And the first picture one sees
on entering the western end of
the room merely accents that
first general impression. Expect-
ing a vivid tropical scene put on
paper with the rapid, vigourous
stroke that is characteristic of
Winslow Homer, the water color—
lst, one is face to face with a
symphony in black and gray and
white that depicts a ship “blown
away," One hurries on, but later
he will return in a somewhat
chastened mood to stand in medi»
tative admiration before this
same scene.

“Lone Woman."

Rockwell Kent's “Lone Woman”
is richer in its purples and
browns and blues, but one views
it with a slight misgiving that
perhaps Kent engaged in some-
thing a little beyond his stride
when he ceased to he Hogarth,
Jr., and abandoned his humorous
and decorative woodcuts for
work of greater pretension.

immediately striking, however.
is William Zorach’s “After the
storm." with its dramatic colors
ing and dynamic sweep. The
power of suggestion and the eco~
nomy of detail in Anne Gold-
thwaite‘s “Flat Tire" are also af-
resting.

But a rapid survey of the en»
tire collection leaves one still un-
satisfied. The great names‘are
thereeand the evidences ofgreatr
ness are there—but one feels that
the show should be called “From
an Artist’s Workshop." It is as
if for the most part one were
looking at sketches for the mas-
terpieces, at rough drafts, at de-

lightful, inconsequential pages
from a travel notebook. And then
the details begin to emerge and
finally loom large: the inimitable
chickens in “Pop" Hart’s scene
from the French market in New
Orleans, the almost oil-painting
richness of Sargent's “Boboli Gar-
dens," the feeling for mass and
contour in George Luks’ figure of
a seated Cuban woman, the
slightly» acid humorous verve of
Walt Kuhn's “Combat."

Still, it is William Zorach’s
“After ,the storm” that emerges
clearly from these minor delights,
but they are there. You may

pictures at all, and certainly a
third time to find the sources of

MAURICE EVANS

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After his opening in “
Theatre, New York, on February 5, 1937, the press of that city
without a dissenting voice pronounced Mauiice Evans' acting of
the first English sovereign to abdicate his throne to be the
greatest portrayal of a Shakespearean role within memory; and
the entire performance and production the most brilliant, ,Lhe
most richly imagined, the most vital, swiftly moving and thrilling
presentation of one of the Bard’s plays known to the modem
American stage,

Upon Mr. Evans' reopening in the metropolis on September
15, to continue the run of 133 performances which ended in May
and to establish a new all time New York Shakespeare record of
171 performances, these same critics not only confirmed their
first judgment but declared that the star's impersonation of the
ill omened playboy king was more glowingly alive, more electri-
cally effective than before, and that the general performance had
grown in feeling and authority.

The privilege of seeing this matchiess performance is about
to be vouchsafed playgoers of this vicinity. It is an opportunity

- that no lover of great drama, great acting and glamorous stag-

ing can afford to let ,pass ungrasped

Mr. Evans is coming with the same splendid company and
spectacular production that surrounded him on his return en»
gagement ‘In New York. There are fortyrthree players in the
cast, including such prominent names as Frederic Warlock, Lee
Baker, Charles Dalton, A. G. Andrews, Lionel Hogarth, and
Eleanor Phelps.

Margaret Webster staged the play and to her direction may
be attributed the surge and sweep of passion which carries the
drama tnmultously through its fourteen scenes to its tragic
conclusion,

Following the first New York performance the critics of the
leading metropolitan papers spoke as follovvs:

“A TREMENDOUS OVATION was accorded Maurice Evans
and his company in ‘King Richard II' at the St, James last night.
For several minutes the audience refused to leave its seats, thun—
dering its applause. Mr, Evans deserves a sort of reverence for
his triumphant performance. Out of one of the less familiar
plays of Shakespeare he has wrought a glorious piece of charac-
terization. It shines through With the majesty of inspired acts
ing,”7Brooks Atkinson in New York Times. 3

“THERE WERE CHEERS at the St. James Theatre last
night. Earned cheers for a stirring, even an exciting: rev al of
Shakespeare's seldom played ‘King Richard 11'. And cheeis as
well for Maurice Evans who gave such a pel‘formance'joﬁ. the
