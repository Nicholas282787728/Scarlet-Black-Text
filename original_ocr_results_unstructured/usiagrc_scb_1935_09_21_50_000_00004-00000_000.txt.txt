EXPENSIVE BUSINESS

Recently a New York hank hrougllt suit
in the Fodbral courts challenging the validity
of the bank deposit guarantee phm of tho Fell.
cral government.

This action on the part of the bankin-
likely to result in disastrous ooiiserlurut
should the validity of the law he silrvocssiully
challenged.

It is true that should all the hanks fail at
one time the deposit insurance fund would t‘l‘l'-
tailily fail to function, for there would not he
money enough in the country to pay all of the
immediate demands. However. since such a
calamity is not likely to happen the act will
give adequate protection.

The real worth of the deposit insurance
plan does not result so much from the actual
mechanical safeguards which it sets up as from
the fact that it was alid still is a incai of re-
storing and maintaining confidence in the
banks and bankers.

When the deposit insurance law was first
enacted, the hanks had reached as law an ebh
as was possible. State banking moratoriums
had Spread through the country lilx'o wild fire
and then came the climax, the national honking
holiday. The country faced a panic, and coul‘ir
deuce was utterly destroyed in the entire hauli-
ing system of the count

Then through the illedinm of the deposit
insurance act which guaranteed the depositors
money, a measure of confidence was restored.
This degree of confidence gradually increased
niitil the banking system was able to resume to
a great extent its normal business.

in the course of time, c ins of politics aro<c
and a determined opposition to tho guaranty
idea developed. This has finally culminated in
the legal challenge r cently issncd by the Now

-atVIDlllfs.

Dr. H. W. Norris, ol the zoology
department, initiated the regular
week-clay chapel service Friday
morning by comparing the effects
of the lives of Cardinal Mereier
end Huey Long upon the world to
iiustrate the fact that in one'S way
of life. “the means is much more
far-reaching than the end."

Cardinal Mercier's philosophy
was ' ove activity and love life",
explained Dr. NnTrlS, for “life with-
out activity is meaningless snd ac-
tivity without life is a mere mech-
anism,” Professor Norris went on
to raise the question of the adV|Sr
ability of instilling In the youth of
today too much patriotism. “There
is too much activity by hatred
and revenge“, he stated, and
“what doth it profit to gain activ-
ity and lose life?”

Huey Long, who gsined activity
but lost life, is according to Dr.
Norris a good example of that age
old question, “does the means jus-
tify the end ,. Long has already
been forgotten by the majority of
people, the speaker pointed out.
but the means he employed are
still corrupting the lives of many.

Cardinal Mercier, however, is an
example of activity and friendli-
ness, said Professor Norris. He
made no compromises, no double
dealings. His life was an open
hook, and the world is is better
place for his having lived. “Life
demands activity; setivity condi-
tions live," he concluded.
