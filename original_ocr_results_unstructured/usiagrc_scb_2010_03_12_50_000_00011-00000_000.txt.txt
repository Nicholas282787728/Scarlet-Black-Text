Baseball drops three over weekend, looks ahead

EV DARWIN MANNING e

The Gtinnell Baseball team soaked in die
Missouri sun and chance to play outdoors as they
played a weekend full of baseball last week in Fula
ton,Mo.The team kicked oti'the season winning
their first game versus Westminster college, by
a score of15-11,1n the ﬁrst e of the season
Grinnell had the chance to show what their of-
fense ms ﬁllly capable ofdoing, -

“The way we won the game was with our
hitt‘ln e didn't give an at bat away,” said outs
ﬁelder 1P. Prouty’lo.

However, Grinnell couldn’t hold up against
Central College, dropping each match up, by a
score of4-14 on Saturday and then one on Suns
day. The Pioneers rounded off the opening week
end by a losing in a squenket to Westminster, by a
final of o7. Despite die losses, in the initial win
over Westminster, the team demonstrated their
ability to regain connol of a tough game.

“We had multiple comebacks and we showed
diat we are tenacious," said team captain Chad
Talmhuki’lO.

Head Coach Tim Hollibaugh was pleased
with how his team dealt with the pressure in that
firstgam

“What led to the victory would be great team
baseball, guys being patient at the plate and some
clutch pitching/defense in the ninth inning to seal
the game up,"l-loliibaugh said.

Though for all of the good feelings that the
first game left the team wim, the next three left as
many question made and frustrations.

“Ourlosses were the result of terrible team de-
fense," said catcher Michael Nodpenski ’12.“We
will. not win games ifwe're consistently making
ﬁve or six errors per game':

The team recorded seven errors in their ﬁrst
game against Central. By the end of the four

games their error count had totaled 19,

"Between our outﬁeld defense and pitching,
wejust didn’t look like a Grinnell College Baseball
team,“Tnlt:ibuki said,

- ‘We made a lot of errors and compounded
those mistakes,instead ofjusr making one we con
unuously made them and hurt our pitching staff
and got’us into a position we couldrit get out of,"
Matt Blilmenxe'ldi Y13 said.

When pressed for an explanation for die
poor showing in the ﬁnal dame? games, the players
seemed to chalk it up to nerves and otpectations.

“Everybody knows that people are still come
peting for positions, everybody is nervous and
don't want to make errors and we didn’t have peo—
ple settling down," said outﬁelder Paden Roder
'10.

The Pioneers hope to make progress on their

nerves and defense in theirhome opener against '

Warthurg at 2 pm. on March 17.

”VVc want to improving on what we learned
over last weekend," Hollibaugh said. “We played
well enough to succeed in all four games, butwe
were our own worst enemy in the end,"

“[Wartbtirg] always have some big power boys
so they hit for power pretty well and We have to be
ready to light," Prouty said.

The Pioneers know that dieir practices and
the game on Wednesday are all preparation for
the spring Break trip.

. “This spring Break trip were facing the
toughest teams we’ve ever faced in our history,”
Takabuki said. “St. Thomas and St. Olaf, our last
ditee games ofthe trip will really be what deﬁnes
our sonng Break trip,"

The 10 game stretch in Vero Beadi, Florida
will begin Sunday, March 21 against Amherst
College at Chain O'Laltes, and ﬁnish with a dam
blehcadervetsus Knox College at home on April 3.

Golf begins spring season

BYMARGUS EAGAN

The Grinnell Men’s Golf team has rea-
son to be optimistic about the season as they
draw near the start of the spring season.
With four of six starters returning from last
years team, the Pioneers believe that a Mide
west Conference (MWC) Championship is
within reach

The focal point ofthe upcoming season
is winning conference, hands down—with-
out a doubt,"said team co—taptain Carlos Lu
’10.“And winning confercntc means you go
to Nationals.,.that’s what we want,"

Head Coach Brian Jaworski felt last
year's MWC tournament demonstrated to
him that a conference championship is a
feasible target.

“Our goal is to win the Midwest con-
ference Championship," Jaworski said. “This
tearn.has been very cotnpetitive the last two
years at the Midwest Conference Champis
onship meet and we finished 10 strokes out
of first place at last year's tournament, over
the course of three days,,.that's not that
many strokes."

Coach Jaworksi explained how the teams
strugg o‘le in last years conference tourndment
derived from the fact that the team played
poorly on the first day ofthe eventThe team
overcame a iésstroke deficit after clay one of
the tournament to tie forfourth. On the last
two days oflhc three-day event, Grinnell ac-
tually had the lowest two-round score.

“There wasn’t [much] synergy between
teammates last year," Jaworksi said, “We as
a team, when we meet at the start of second
semester [this year], we had a heart to heart.
We identified our greatest weakness, and
turned it into one of our greatest'strengths.
Last year, there just was not as much camzr
raderle as there could have been." _

Lu cited similar reasons for the team's
shortcomings‘last year. Both Lu and Jawor»
ski emphasized that the team wants to move

away from the notion of golfis an individual -

sport, because, for thc Grirmell Men’s Golf
team, it is not, > .

“This year we are trying to steer the team
into a direction of more team camaraderie
than years past," Lu said. “I feel like the golf
team in years past has been this group of

_ semi—random guys. We're deﬁnitely trying

to build more'team unity and teameboiiding
than in years past."

Team coreaptain Pete Kieselbach ’10,
stressed that changes in the team's training
regimen pulled the team members closer,

”We've started weightelifting this year, as
a team, on consistent basis," Kleselbach said.
“But probably the biggest thing is that an
outdoor driving range opened up in Newton,
only 20 minutes away."

The driving range that Kieselbach is
referring to is the Fore Seasons golf com
plex that features a dome so that Grinnell
Students can regularly hit a ball and see its
fight, crucial to ﬁncetuning a golf swing.
For the first time in the team's history, the
Pioneers were able to practice in an outdoor
practice facility for the winter. In addition
to a driving range, the facility also has turf
greens to practice putting

Despite the ncwfoltnd ttuirndetie and
the newly built training facilities, the team
expects tough conference competition

“Last year Monmouth won conference
and they returned a great majority of their
roster and I think, pet that, you luv: to say
that they ilrc the favorites in the conference,"
Kieselhncli said.

However. for now, the Pioneers will focus
on what they can control—their commits
ment and’prepﬂralion.

“You can't control winning and losing in
sports, and certainly not at the Division 111
level," Jaworski said. “The only thing you
can control is the experience that we have
together."

‘Tt's going to be am and beautifulweather, but
it's also going to be exhausting, so the number one
doing is to be mentally prepared that you're going
to be physically othaustod and still be able to play
through it, "Roder said.

The spring lirmk mp will be a great test for
the team.

“We need to learn how to weather the stonn
when things start going wrong, speciﬁcally when
we start making errors, and not let one bad play
snowball," Nodzenski said. “We need to prove to

LAWRENCE SUMoLoNG

ourselves that we’re just as oriented as any team in
the country, and can go toe to toe with some of
the nation’s top ranked teams."

Coach Hollibaugh is conﬁdent that it will be
a successful trip and one matwill put them in on
the right foot for the rest ofthe seasoni

“lfwe improve on the little things atom the
past weekend, play to win every game and play
Grinnell College baseball, then we know' it will be
a successﬁil trip, Hollibaugh said '
