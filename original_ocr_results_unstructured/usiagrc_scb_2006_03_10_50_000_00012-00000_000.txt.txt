OPINION

March l0, 2006

 

Resolved :

To formulate an effective policy toward the new Hamas-
dominated Palestinian government, the United States, and oth—
or Western powers, must ﬁrst overcome the fallacy that money
has rhe mngicnl power to cure all oiscciery's ills, ifonly enough
of it is issued to the appropriate authorities.

This rvpe of thinking would have the Us l d Wcsr phy

hat the Poles '11ians have almost on economic
lsrrucrure with which rhey could pur foreign .nd ru good
use (1nd even if they did, private investmenr would make more

likely to 5:: it on 1 communal level, and with the collective
Palcsr'lnian posture toward Israel becoming even more violent
and uncompmmi‘hg.

The U.S. should withotd aid from

to this show of democracy by curring cff1id from tllc Palcsrilis

hospitnls as well as to provide urilitics and necessary services to
rhc Palestinian people. The U.S, furrhcr thrcnrcns to continue
withholding this did until Hamas backs away from its hardlinc
stances, causing Palestine to run a monthly budget deﬁcit ofover
8100 m1].bon.Th1s is yet another example ofan imperialist nation
taking :1 moralist posirion that comcs across as blatantly hypo-
critical (0 all but rhc blindcsrjingoisrs,

Certainly, H1mas’ recent election is 1 cause for concern. It
is distressmg given its penchant for resorting to violence. The
organization has, to durc, been involved in around 350 suicide

bombings. Ycr, Homes
is also 1 gr1ssroors
movement seeking
to improve rhc lot of
Palestinians. It offers
1 government that will
not be corrupt like
Ar1f1t's 1nd that will
gcr things done. Bc-
sides, mil1r1nt groups
have taken the seat of
governmcnr through
legitimarc democratic
elections before, so
this is nothing terribly
new. Also, the U.S. has
been chummy wirh
similarly shady orgos
nizarions throughout
the Cold War. It is one thing to withhold 1id from a government,
1nd irs people, rhzir depends on this 11d; ir is quirc another to fund
terrorist organisations and their activities. We know the Us. to
have been complicit in the latter, and thus, having Dick Cheney
talk of moral reasons to deny 1id to rho Palestinian government is
birrerly humorous.

American isolationism of H1m1s led Palestine is not just
hypocritical, but also ill advised. With the Abu Gharib scandal,
diplomatic gaffes and a near internarional consensus that the U. S.
is an arrogant sclf appointed pollccm1n of rho world, ir might be
wiser for the us, ro refrain from raking rhe high horse.

How will this treatment of Hamas and of the Palestinians
help? Ifthe U.S. thinks rhat it can force Hamas inro moderating
irs stand, it would do well to go: in rouch with historians special-
izing in the Middle East. One does not pur groups like Hamasr
which cnn and will resort to violence into 1 posiricn where they
feel rhey mus(,Th: us. Mid-East policy he failed and for obvi—
ous reasons, Let's not repeat pisr misrnkcs.Whilc the us. should
make clear that it is not going rc be party rc iny violcncc, whcrhcr
directed it lsruelis, Palestinians or foreigners alike, 1 less judge
mcnml snncc can only help rhings.

Hnmas musr be seen as rhc voice of a people who lnve been
ignored and mistreated for too long. It is time ro work mil/J Pile
cstlnc.Tl1c first srep is to continue providing the Palestinian Aus
rhonry wirh viril funds for the Palestinian people. Let's allows
H1m1s to transform from an organization rhat uses violence
to one that negotiates and uses diplomatic means. This is not a
sound position and more productive than isolationism and blamnr
moralism from a counrry hardly enridecl to any such moral high
horse.

Explaining staff ed’s role

The hyperbolic storm ofcriricism regarding last week's staff
editorial provides us with a good opporruniry rc explain our pur—
pose and role in writing editorials.

Our editorials are meant to contribute re the '
campus debate by expressing :1 clearly articulared
opinion on 1n issue concerning the student body If
people are talking about our editorial on Monday,
then we consider it a success.

we don't attack people for rhc sake of crenring conﬂict, bur we
do 11k: to foster discussion by advocating for a controversial view.
Sometimes we srep on 1 few toes in the process, and while regrets
t1ble, we recognize this is occasionally necessnry for Grinnell to
grow as a community.

Our staff editorials, like those at newspapers everywhere, are
not anonymous. To the contrary, you can sec the authors’ names
every week in rh: staff box, which usunlly (but nor almys) runs
right by the editorial.

The entire editorial staff collectively writes editorials. One per-
son will usually write a hrsr don, but rhis represents the consensus

that we've arrived at du1ing our Sunday night editor meetings.
Editorials usuuily go rhrough several rewrites and revisions by vdre
, ions members of the staff, and everyone approves
the final version.
To maintain trust from rhc campus ccmnius
11 nity, we constantly rry to prevent editorial biases
mm," al from affccring the shape or form of news coverage.
—— For evuniplc, often \vewrirc about an issue rhnt our
news section has covered
In those c15es,wel1avc several sofcguards in place ro prevent
conﬂicrs of intercst, If any Editor has, 1s a course of their ‘ob at
the paper, overseen srorics on an issue that we're addressing in an
editorial, then he or she abstains from the process.
In case you do not make it to the staff box, here are our names
(just this once).
