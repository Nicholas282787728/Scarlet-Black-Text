One at the first Visible results of the
sewer project is that Arbor Lake has been
cleared and declared safe [or l|Sl’|. For his
part. Brand has turned what once was a
dump into a park enjoyed by the entire
community. "During the process [ot’clear-

got some wild geese and ducks, and put
them down there ,

had every right to do llrom a legal stand

Brand said.

McConneii‘s decision "did not go over

raised the sewer hills. and that goes
against the grain oi the people."

Finally. the candidates tor Mayor also

council elections. According to Brand.
Robert Anderson. a candidate tor Mayor
and chairman oi the Republican Party in
Powcshiek county. “had a really organize
cd camp, He got a list oi all the voters and
called people. On election day. they called
Anderson supporters. and had poll wat-
chcrs [Phil] Palmer {Anderson's upper
nentl did not have all that "

Brand continued to explain that
"Powcshlek county is very Republican.
Even though it wasn‘t a [partisanl race ..
Anderson. as chairman ot the Republican
party. had quite a lollowing that pushed
him over the hill. He beatrPalmer by

Brand has unique insight mto both "how
people lin the commuiiityl think” about
the college. and how the college relates to
the community,

Regarding town perceptions ot the c0~
existing college. Brand said. "They
Imcmbers oi the communityl just have
the idea that the college taelities are only
sit up in certain people. hat is there cone
coption. They don't t'eei as though they are
wanted.

However. irom the perspective ol a
ci-innell College employee. Brand sees
that "lhe F. is open to thewhole tow-n.

. and most importantly. -onvocation is
tint-n to everyone” Brand said ot last
week's convocation speaker. Robert
McNamara. “How many towns in Iowa
can get a man like him to speak? It was

According to Brand. hoth the community
and the eollegc , i» at a disadvantage ii‘
they do not intei d ”it is important lor
the town and school to mix. to haic good
