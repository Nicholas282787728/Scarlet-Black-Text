“um, it’s pretty relaxed,’*Tansey said when describing.
somewhat questioningly, the Studio atmosphere.

Bur Tansey and Culver are not relax:d about setting
and pursuing rurure DJ goals. “We had plans to learn domi-

“Dominoesl” Culver echoed

At the moment, however, those plans have yet to be

Culver and Tansey do not Forget that each selected an
MC Hammer cassette tape for their first musical purchase,
Though Culver once sported a ﬂat top haircut, neither DJ

This semesrer, Tansey said he spam "ovenlls and a

Culver dons a diaper. And, he said, likely in direct
relation, he “gets rally drunk."

Tansey's terms get rather bare-boned when he discusses
the method with which he selecrs music to play. in her,
he pun an entirely new spin on KDIC. “1 spin around
and let my boner pick," he said.

Culver and Tniiscy have bones to pick with people
who like the likes otJayz and suggest rhey not listen.
Tanscy also renised airwaves to “whim capitalists, Fascist
pigs, oi sam Junge.”

Though they imagine no one really listens to their
show, Culver and Tansey consciously rry to may rroni
what everybodydocs listen to. “There's a lot orrcnlly good
shit out there rhat doesn't get air time," Culver said.

Culver also said when he grows up he'd like to be a
ﬁreman. Tansey quickly noted that as such it would be
“completely inappropriate" to listen to hip.hop.

Culver concurred: “I‘d have to start lisrcning to Top

still, for the next three weeks, Culver andTanscy will
continue to adolescently help their listeners bone up on
