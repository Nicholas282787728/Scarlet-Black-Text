SGA Elections

 

4

Next Wednesday, the Grinnell
College student body will be asked
to select its leaders for the 1990-91
academic year. In a competitive
race. this selection process depends
on careful consideration of the vari-
ouscandidates,dteirrelative merits,
and their individual liabilities.

On Saturday night. two of
the presidential candidates, Pedro
Fernandez»McCarthy and Scott
Truesdell, will participate ina KDIC
radio show. The third candidate,
Craig Jeffrey, is participating in a
conference and is unable to attend.
This will be a good opportunity for
the campus to scnttinize the condi-
dates as they ﬁeld questions from
other students. as well as each other.

Monday night's Open Fo-
rum will also provide an oppoan
nity to observe the candidates as
they respond to student questions.

Before attending the Open
Forum or listening to the KDIC, we
urge students to read the candidates'
statements of intent and their an-
swers to the Scarlet and Black's
questions. Students are being of-
fered numerous opportunities to
learn about the candidates, so there
is no excuse for casting a misinr
formed vote.

As the Scarlet and Black
staff has already discovered, select-
ing candidates can be a difﬁcult and
arduous process. From it, we deter»
mined the qualities that we believe

Scarlet&Black SGA Election Supplement

And Now a Word from
the Scarlet and Black

are needed in the next president and
vice-president,

In positions that can only
function with student involvement,
personality must be considered.
SGA officers must be open and
willingtolistenandrespcctdieviews
and opinions of all students. It is
important to think about how the
different candidates deal and relate
to other students.

Experience with SGA is
another important factor, While
it is possible for the president- or
vice—president—elect to learn the func-
tions and responsibilities of the
positions, how much time would it
take to do this'.7

SGA experience is not the
only type of experienccthat needs to
beconsidered. It isalso important to
examine the candidates' previous
attempts to represent different stu~
dent interests to SGA. the admini-
stration, and the faculty. How effeea
tive have the attempts been? Is the
campus better off because of a par-
ticular candidate‘s effons?

Work with students as stu-
dent advisors or hall activity coordie
nators also serves as good experi-
enceforlhe SGApresidentand vice-
prcsident. It is here that the candi-
dates demonstrate their ability to
work with their potential constitu-
ents. A candidate who is unable to
relate to the people on his or her
ﬂoor is probably not going tobeable
to represent the general campus.

Another fair question is
whether acandidate can commit the
time necessary to be an effective
president or vice-president. These
positions take for more time than
most students are generaly aware.

Before discussing our sole
cctions forendorsetnent,afinalcon-
sidertttion should bemadc. TheSGA
president and vice-president repre-
sent the student body in areas that
extend beyond their ofﬁcial duties.

faculty, and the town.

And now for the Scarlet
and Black endorsement:

For SGA viceApresident/
president of academic affairs, we
endorse Deb Koa. Her experience
as SGA administrative coordinator
provides her with a strong back-
ground in student government. Koa
has alsoservedinpositionsthathave
given her contact with the admini-
stration. These positions, and her
eontactwith thefaculty as amcmber
of the Economics SEPC, will bener
fit the entire campus as she pursues
her duties as president of academic
affairs.

Our examination of presi-
dentialcandidates,however,hasonly
led to confusion and conﬂict. No
single candidate stands out with
extensive experience.

Furthermore, a mmor of
staff favoritism has arisen as the
process of deciding on an endorse-
ment has progressed. Because of
this, the Scarlet and Black staff was
placed in, basically, a no»win SittIr
ation. Endorsing any of the candi-
dates would be seen as determined
by personal bias or as an attempt to
counteract the nimor. This staffwill
not endorse a candidate because of
personal relationships with a candi-
date, but at the same time. those
relationships will not prevent our
endorsement.

Nevertheless, because this
rumor has become so rampant, the
credibility of the Scarlet and Black
would be called into question no
matter whom we endorse.

We do believe that the
Scarlet and Black has me right to
endorse candidates for SGA office.
This is only the third year that en
dorsemean have been made, and a
questionable endorsement could
jeopardize our ability to make future
endorsements.

Therefore, we are exercis-
ing our right to refrain from endors-
ing a SGA presidential candidate.

SGA: Looking for the Perfect
SGA Candidates

continued from page 1

proven to be true this year with Rob
andAlanna. They had a greatmixof
experience (Rob) and new blood
(Alanna). But we do recommend
that you don’t vote for two candi-
dates who both have little or no ex-
pcrience in SGA.

Which candidates have SGA ex-
perience? Which have ever worked
with SGA in any capacity (a HAC
planning a party, a student group
member seeking funding, etc)?

Doestheeandidate haveanyexpe-
rience working with the College
administration?

The candidates knowledge of
College bureaucracy is almost as
imponant as theirknowledgeofSGA
bureaucracy. Like every bureauc-
racy. the Grinnell College admini-
stration has its own unique quirks.
To successfullylobby forchangeon
behalf of the student body Lhe SGA
president and vice-president must
have a clear idea of how the College
administration works. In addition,
on average seven or eight students
contact SGA each week asking for
help in wading through College
bureaucracy. To be of any use to
these students. the SGA President
andVice»presidentmusthaveaclear
understanding of the College ad-
ministration’s structure. For ex-
ample.it'sinva.luableknowing: who
reports to whom in the administra-
tion? who does/doesn't like each
other in the administration? which
secretaries can get things done for
you quicker than the administrator

they work for'.l which administra-
tors will respond to your computer
mail message the same day they
receive it?

No matter who is elected. it will
take some time for that person to
become familiar with college bu—
reaucracy. But someone who has
had some prior experience with that
bureaucracy will need much less
time to learn the system and, there-
fore, will be of use to the student
body in a shorter amount of time.
Which candidates have helped plan
events that have allowed them to
wade through college bureaucracy
firsthand? Which candidates have
been in a student group leadership
position where they‘ve been had an
opportunity to work with adminis-
trators. Which candidates have
worked with administrators in any
capacity? '

Some would argue that we have-
n’t mentioned what they feel are the
two most imponant qualities in a
candidate: imagination and creativ-
ity. Those qualities are certainly
important, and ideally. the SGA
presidentand vice»president should
be imaginative and creative. But all
the creativity in the world is useless
unless the person with it has the
practical (dare we say bureaucratic)
skills to implement her or his vision
for SGA.

Take the time to read through this
issue of the 5&3, listen to KDlC
between six and seven pm tomor»
row, come to the candidates’ open
fomm on Monday at 7:30pm in S.
Lounge, and keep asking yourself
the questions we've suggested in
this article. Good luck!
