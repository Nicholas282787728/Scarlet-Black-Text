College copy-
right policy
being revised

BV JIABEI PAN

Throughout the semester, Eric Bell or; frequently
visits the Grinnell library web page, logs in and down-
loads articles and book excerpts to read before class.
These readings, accessible over the internet thanks to
Grinnell’s electronic reserve (Erreserve) system, sup-
plement regular course textbooks, and Bell, like many
students, appreciates the system’s convenience.

“It is pretty easy,"Bell said. “just a matter Ofslglr
ing in and clicking your mouse a few times, and you
can read documents."

Many students share Bell’s experiences with E-
reserve, but next year may see changes, The college
is currently revising its copyright policy for the first
time since 1995, and it is unclear whether this will
limit professors ability to post articles and book ere
cerpcs online.

One worry is that a change will require students
to pay more money (or course materials. Publishers
are concerned that interncl distribution ofmaterials is
costing them money The college hopes to preserve a
free ﬂow otinl‘ormation without inviting lﬂWsilitsc

Grinnell's Eereserve system has been running for
three years and is experiencing substantial growrli.
The system held some 300 articles last spring semesr
ter. For the first half of this semester alone, the figure
has risen to around 1,500.

The large increase in E—reserve usage is straining a
copyright policy written when photocopying was the
main method of distriburing materials. “The policy
didn't address [electronic reserves] at all,"said Associ-
ate Dean of the College Jon Chenette. “It wasn't en»
visioncd in 1995."

in the summer of 2005, Chenette formed the
Copyright Task Force to revise the policy. The mm,
mittee consists of 11 members, including teprescntlr
tives from Audiovisual services, and the libmiy, as
well as administrators, curricular technology special-
ists. faculty and SGA Vice President Michael Billups
'07, the only snidenr representative.

Currently, the task force is examining copyright
policies at other colleges across the country. They
have formulated a preliminary recommendation, but
before the policy is iinalizcd, it will have to gain ape
proval from the faculty, the lnsrructional support
Committee, President Russell K. Osgood and college
lawyers. Chenetre hopes the new policy will be rin-
ished by next May and said it will have to be revised
constantly. “There will be new challenges and new
possibilities to take advantage of," Chenette said.

The central issue regarding E—reserve is the can,
cepr of“fair use," a set offour guidelines deﬁned in
federal copyright law. “50 long as the material falls
within this fairly narrow circle, we don’t have to ask
for permission," Librarian of the College Richard
Fyffe said.

The exact size of that circle. however, depends on
interpretation of fair use. Publishers are concerned
that colleges making materials available electronically
will hurt their sales. The Association of American
Publishers recently challenged the Univeisity ofCalir
forniirsan Diego’s E-reserve policy, an act noticed by
colleges across rhe country.

Grinnell has not yet been contacted by publlslir
ers about its Erl‘esctve system, Ont: otrlie principles
guiding the Copyright Task Force is to assert Grin-
nell’s own right to fair use. “[We will] not just give
[the policy] tip because we are scared wc are going to

Underground jazz

Live Monday night jazz shows enliven and pack Bob’s Underground Cafe

BY KATHRYN Benson, JULIA BOTTLES 8i MEGAN GoERlNc

Smooth strains ofjazz ooze throughout the small ioom. A sues
phone wails seductively. Patrons crowded around small tables sip
drinks as they take in the scene, ls this a scene from 19205 Chicago?
No, it's Bob’s Underground on Jazz Night,

This scmcstei, Bob’s Jazz Nighr has become a weekly outlet for
musicians and music-lovers alike. A slightly dirrerent assortment of
musicians gathers each Monday to play a blend of standard tunes
and improv, drawing large crowds of students and other community
members.

The mind behind the music is Chelsea Levcnthal ‘07. At the be
ginning orthe semester, she sent an email to several campus musi~
ciaiis inviting participation in a weeklyjazz showcase As one of two
events coordinatois for Bob’s Underground Cafe. Leventhal is re-
sponsible for bringing special and weekly events to the coffeehouse.

The response ro her e-mail was impressive. “On the ﬁrst night,
we had almost 11 people," said Leventhal. “Usually we have two
drummers, an upright bass, guitar piano and several melody instrur
ment57lnCludlng baritone sax, alto sax, violin, trumpet and tr0m*
bone." Other instruments have also made appearances, including
ﬁddle and ﬂute.

Anyone who plays jazz is invited to participate, Jazz Night brings
togerher musicians from varying musical backgrounds, including
casual musicians and members of various music ensembles. Regulai
perrormer Randy Brush, husband ofRLC Kim Hinds-Emsli, has
several years otproressional jazz experience.

Recently, tree jazz has been ciopping up at the beginning and
end of sessions, with some musicians participating as others warm
up or have a cigarette j t outside the door. Fiec jazz emphasizes
unconventional and exper iental sound, and Giinnell's version oft
ren features tlissoninr cords and primal screams

terviews With Bob

Musicians are responsible for bring- '
ing their own instruments, and Bob’s
supplies ampliﬁers and microphones.
Bob's also promtles books ofshect music
ranging from jazz standards like “Satin
Doll" to funkiei songs like "Cantaloiipe
Island."

Audience turnout has been imptCSr
sive. Levenrhal estimates average are
tendanee at 40. and says that up to 50
students have squeezed into the venue
to listen to and socialize with fellow
Grinuelllans.The event draws an assort-
ment of jazz enthusiasts, Bob’s regulars
and students looking for a study break—
:i mix emblematic ofthe “many different
styles" thar Leventhal says characterize
the style or music.

Some students bring homework to
Jazz Night. although many say the lively
jam sessions can make ir difﬁcult to
concentrate.“1 usually have homework with me,”said Hannah Sayle
'08,“but it doesn't get done."

Audience members said they appreciate the opportunity to see
jrizz take shape in front or them. Audience membei Ross Preston
'10 said the popularity of Jazz Night “confirms Giinnell as being a
diverse and piogiessive place."

Jazz Night's liirleback atmosphere sets it apart from other
performance venues. Perrorineis “know they're playing for then
friends,” said audience member Bryan Bel'ilbc '07. “It's a relaxed at-
mosphcrc."
