CURIOUSERAND CURIOUSER
Despair, danger and dreams

The popularity polls go up and
down for George Herbert Walker
Bush like they have in the past for
every other president. There is, how-
ever,an important distinction. Where
other presidents’ polls look like a
roller coaster ride going up and down
almost dizzyingly, Bush’s are a great
deal closer to Everest. Through wars,
empty promises and using the flag as
a fashion statement, the polls went
up. All things, good and otherwise,
however, must come to an end. As
they saywhatgoes up. .. well,enough
cliches, you get the idea. So, as in the
past when Bush’s popularity grew
withoutan end in sight. andwequaked
at the thought of this inevitable con-
tinuation of the Reagan»Bush Dy-
nasty into yet another term, now we
risk making the opposite mistake. As
his popularity falls, Democrats be—
comelaxandlet theirguard down and
assume, as so many did in ‘88, that
they have an easy victory.

The signs of this problem are all
about. Today a poll comes out saying
that an unnamed Democrat is more
popular than the real walking and
talking George Bush. As the words
come across the TV, I can hear the
waves of applause as they run down
the loggia. But it is like counting out

the prize fighter before the fight even
actually begins. It is not a problem
limited to college students. eitherr I
fear that the same trap is open to six
other men in whom some have in-
vested high hopes They forget that
George Bush is a savvy politician
who holds on to office like a droan
ing man holds onto driftwood. He
will be tough to beat, no matter how
fasthe secmstobeheadingdown hill.
So how do you beat George Bush'r7
What is the secret? [cannot know for
sure, but I have an idea,

People in this country are scared.
Our society is in a state of flux, and
people cannot see past the shaky
ground they are standing oanhey see
the world around them changing and
do notknow how to respond. It is easy
to ignore from Grinneil, but the signs
are out there. As unemployment soars,
the economy seems unstable. and
people lose faith in the government‘s
ability to govern. They feel a lack of
direction and of purpose. [can imag-
inefew feelingsmore frightening than
this one—— believing you are on a

sinking ship.Asaresult, many willbe
drawn to demagogues like David
Duke, Contrary to Mike Washbum’s
argument that people vote for Duke
out of some gut-level love ofPopulist
conservatism, what they really want
is change, clear direction and leader-
ship. A president must provide those
things in these frightening times.

In the other times we have faced
the national trial of lack of confi-
dence and despair, and demagoguas
were evident. The Revolution, the
Civil War and the Great Depression
all stand out as the worst of those
crises. In every case, leaders rose to
guide us and provide the direction we
needed. As Walt Whitman likened
Lincoln to the captain of the Ameri»
can ship guiding her through stormy
seas, so has each leader taken the
helm and charted for dris nation a new
course. That is what is needed now
We do not need name~calling, or
Congressrbashing, but a message to
provide the spark in the lighthouse to
give us this much needed direction.

Oneof the potential sources of that
flame, Senator Bob Kerrey, said it
best when he spoke of these past
crisis and how each was overcomeby

A model of decorum and tranquility

I’ve been thinking about a lot of
serious issues in the past two weeks.
Women. Men. Sexual abuse. Came
pus groups. The Scarlet and Black.
Ways to get things done. And I‘ve
been drinking about the people in-
volved, the names and faces we all
know. The main players in this game.

I really have begun to see campus
politics as a garnet think about strat-
egy rather than my instinct toward
fight or ﬂight, as the case may be. I
think about the most effective way to
make my point on various issues, and
I see each point made as a successful
play.

I now envision each majorcztmpus
issueasagameofchess,with“oppos-
ing” sides gearing up for the “battle."
Each player can be represented as a
playing piece, with a specific agenda
toward the end goal of an ideological
or practical victory, and some of us
can function as the real players of the
game, with some control over the
board, for our own pet issues. At the
same time, I know that this is not an
accurate model, that there are never
just two easily identiﬁable sides, that
there’s never a clear winnerr What
does winning reallymeanin the game
of politics? The total game is never
over, and each battle’s repercussions
are felt longafter the players move on
to other games

Sometimes] long for our conflicts
to fall into such a neatly deﬁnedplay-
ing area, with rules for movement,
familiar tactics. Playing pieces that
would make their contribution, then

disappear in the supreme and hope-
fully beneficial sacrifice, only to be
reborn in the nextgame with similar
movementsbutanew strategy.Every
move calculated, simplified, visible
to everyone on the ﬁeld.

As a senior, I no longer cast a
bewildered gaze as others on theplayr
ing ﬁeld make their moves. Though I
don’t usually control the board, I see
all ofit most ofthe time and see what
each individual move means in rela»
tion to other players and to the game.

Thatdoesn’t necessarily mean Iknow
What the next move should be, but I
do feel a much greater senseofunderr
standing and can make educated
guesses concerning moves to avoid
moves with a chance of success.

As I said, this isn’t an accurate
model, and I don‘t plan to look at
everything I do as pan of a chess
game from now on I just wanted to
express my frustration at the crazy
nature of getting along with Other
people Sometimes it wotdd be really
comforting, even if as the loser of the
particular battte, to achieve a defini-
tive Checkmate. So we can start a
fresh game.

THE REAL WORLD
Cart I borrow your car?

Ittook almosttwoandahalfhours,
but frnally we found someone who
agreed to let us borrow his car.

”It’s a small one," we were told.

Small?PshaerheGuinnessBook
of World Recordslists Lhatsome fatne—
seeking crunch lover once fit 26
people and a German shepherd into a
V.W. bug. Compared to that, a mere
seven folks in a Toyota is the epitome
of elbow room

There was one other minor com~
pllcalionilhc car liked to refuse to
start for no apparent reason, and the
mechanic at the gas station told us
that the starter was probably
“roached.”

“Nevah get there,” hepronounced,
solemn, with his fertilizer-advertis-
ing baseball cap pulled low over his
eyes. “Wec’n getcha new’n some-
time tomorra, maybe."

But tomorrow was 20 hours too
late to make it to South Bend by 8:00,
and besides, I’dbe damned ifI’dpaid
for putting a brand new starter in a
borrowed car.

“Oh, it’ll work,” I assened, With a
frne show of conﬁdence. “We’lljust
drive six hours without turning the
car off. No problem."

This statement caused the number
of people in the car to drop conve-
niently down to four, creating a sur-
plus oflegroom and freeing thetrunk
for baggage.

With the dire warnings of one of
my ship-jumping friends echoing in
my ears like the lyrics of a Greek
chorus of doom (“You‘ll have to turn
the car offat some point! You’ll have
to get gas! Think about that!"), I
floored it, and we were off.

Halfway to Iowa City, we noticed
a problem

"Hey," said Lib, in the passenger
seat, “I don‘t think the hoods closed
all the way.”

Fourpeopleconcencrated, blinked,
and concentrated again, No reliable
general consensus was reached.

Everyone sat for a minute in silent
contemplation, waiting for action.

“Uh, Laura—you gonna pull over
and shut that?" Lib asked, ﬁnally.
Outside, a truck swerved away from

us at the last possible second. the
driver waving a beefy fist in our di-
rection.

“Oh,can’twejustdrivewithillike
that “ I suggested. “I mean, it’s only
a borrowed car."

"What? " Jamie asked, and we kept
driving.

“How fast do you think it's going
when we bury the speedometer
needle?" I asked. conversationally.
as we passed iowa City.

“Well, I think if you take a four-
cylinder over 110 the engine ex-
plodes.”

“So we‘re going 109," Ireasoned,
afterafew complicated mentalcalcu-
lations. “Good thing, huh?"

A few minutes later, we went over
a bump and a demonic screech of
metal against pavement reached us.

“Did you hear that?”

“What?"

Obligingly, I aimed directly for
thenext pavemental inconsistency and
the metallicgrind repeateditseif. even
more dramatically.

..Yeah."

Jamie spoke up from the back “I
bet it’s the, urn. you know, tailpipe
thing." There was a murmur of as-

sent

“Well. that’s not so bad, " I said.
trying to keep up my group‘s morale.
“i mean, if the tailpipe falls off, we
just pollute the atmosphere a little
more than usual, right? I mean, we
can still drive it, right?”

“I think so," Lib answered. a little
dobiously.

“Besides,” came the inevitable re-
joinder, “It’s only a borrowed car"

So we kept on, with the rear sec—
tion ofthe carletting upa little puffof
foul-smelling smoke every time we
hit a large bump or a small animal.
Finally we realized that there was no
avoiding our certain destiny~wc had
to stop for gas and also for the bath-
