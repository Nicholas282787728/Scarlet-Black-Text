Flea markets: American institutions

This week, ﬁnding a column
topic was difﬁcult After all, what
could I say that could top last
column’s confession about the dc»
sirability of Amy Ray‘s perspira-
tion? I ﬁnally thoughtof something
perhaps more embanassing to ad»
mil: 1 love to go to the flea market.

Those of you without cars may
never have actually made it to the
fairgrounds for these regular ex—
u-atvaganzas. For your beneﬁt, and
for those who simply haven’t felt
like going, I'd like to describe my
trip to the flea market

The flea marketis the nextbest
thing toaneighborhood garage sale.
Iprcfermass garage sales, because
of the greater variety of junk - er,
prezowned collectibles. But the flea
marketprobablytellsus moreabout
Americanculture because trends of
common possessions over time are
here discernible and because goods
are deliberately Chosen for sale. as
opposed to representing an attempt
to clear the garage of unwanted
possessions.

Flea markets are scheduled in
advance. and dealers Sign up for
tablesatwhich to peddle lheirwares.
Antique, toy. and hook dealers are
typical attendees, and one man I
once chatted with told me that he
made a living by traveling around
the country to flea markets, collecta
ing and selling stuff as he went.
Prices are generally fair. though the
value of something ofﬁcially “cot
lectible" is usually recognized. For
example. this weekend I saw a Su—

$80 on the same table with ceramic

show was particularly interesting,

some way to hardware stores,judgr

near the frontbore a sign with bold,
block letters: “Men! Look - Nuts
and BolLs and Etc. 25 cents.“ I tend
to forget how sensitive I am to
gender issues until I sec signs like
this one that society. as a whole,
isn’t quite as aware as I arm I won
dered if the man would let me buy
some nuts and bolu and elcetera,
even though I am female. or if he
would feel obliged to explain what
each of them was used fort I was too
startled to explore the possibilities
at the time.

I wandered down the aisles, lak»
ing it all in: model cars. jewelry,
baseball cards. old keys, jars of
buttons, used Atari cartridges and
cassettes. pocket knives. bottle
openers. and antiques galore One
man specialized in used tackle and
lures, his sign explaining all:
“Fishin‘ spoken here." Another
table was run by a man and woman
who appeared white butsold genu-

had a rawhide how. a rifle with
beadwork on the stock and feathers
hanging from the barrel. and an

few of their offerings, I didn’tgetn
chanceto ask them abouttheirsluff.
as I arrived near closing time. i
turned the comer and saw a table
with onlyT-shins and buttons onit.
I soon realized the common theme:
the War. I was expecting examples
or excessive patriotism, butl was
still surprised at the message sent
by some of the designs.

Targetcrosshairs were common.
One design showed a generic Arab
on a camel through a target sighc
with the slogan, “I’d fly 10,000
miles to smoke a Camel." Another
had a picture of Saddam through a
sight: “INSANE HUSSEIN — Time
for your medication."

Violence was highly glorified.
“Good Morning lraaaadaq!“ ace
companied a drawing oi‘an Amerir

oflhe shirts were this bad. but these
stood out as particularly anti»Arab
and gleefully patriotic.Whilelstooti
in front of the table scribbling this
information on a scrap of paper, the
woman seemed curious and started
talking about the current situation
in the Middle East. I sort of shook
my head and said, “Interesting.“
Sherespondedbysaying.“Wehave
some really bad ones that I didn‘t
bring." I think I’d rather not see
those,

I put my pen away. shook my
head again, and wandered over to
the black velvet wall hangings fora
casual perusal.

 

WHOSE RIGHT
The realities beyond campus

What a funny thing the Grinnell
mindset is. It's so easy to forget the
big picture when you spend eighty
percent of your time within four
square city blocks. We forget about
what life is really like and what's
really important. Sorry folks. but
kegs and midscms don’t last for
ever. eventually it all catches up
with you.

Listening to the reactions to the
nation of Islam speaker reminded
me of a reality rarely seen here on
campus; bigotry. Yes people, you
can be a block, liberal lesbian in a
wheelchair and ﬁt right in here at
Grinnell, and i think that that is a
good thing, but what happens after
graduation? Ont: hopes that every-
one will be able to carve their own
niche in the outside society, but
sometimes that can bepretty tough.
There are a lot of obstacles out
there. and we can‘t forget about
them, If we get too comfortable,

tic spirit in this country. I feel the
need to express fundamental dis~
sent. Although i have no doubts
about the malevolence of Saddam
Hussein, I do question the legitir
macy oflhc current war with Iraq.
Operation Desert Storm is not a
moral campaign: it is zt purely eco-
nomic expedition.

By engaging in war, the United
States wishes to reestablish a bal—
ance of power in the Middle East,
so her vital oil intercsﬁ will be
protected. Unfortunately, the costs
ofthc war will likely prove greater
than Lhcbcncﬁls ofmaintainingour

deed we will do ourselves a dis-
service in attempting to protect the
Middle Eastern oil supply; Amerir
can society must become energy
independent. Because the United
States relies on the importation of
oil. she is dependent on despots.

relationships with dictators invari-
ably lead to precarious oil markets
Because the Middle East is an un-
stable region. Western oil interests
can quickly become threatened, For
example. the oil embargo of the
1970's triggered oil shortages and
damaged theAmerican’seconomy.
Now, Hussein‘s occupation of Kur
wait has clearly provoked reccsr
sion in the United States. To avoid
future conflict and eliminate the
need to send troops to the Middle
East. the United States must be

jettisoned these programs because
oil became inexpensive. Now. the
UnitedStates muslregain herinno-
votive spirit and move expedi-
tiously, with the necessary taxes
and subsidies, to develop altcma-
tivc sources of energy. in the short
run economic costs may be high,
but in the long run energy substi~
tutes would be much cheaper.

Furthermore, cncrgy indepen-
dcncc would reduce the value of
Middle Eastern oil. Thus, dictators
such as Husscln would not find it
worthwhile to seize the world’s oil
reserves. The United States should
invest in energy programs rather
than prosecute a war with Iraq, Ai-
lhough the United States must
contain Iraqi aggression with cco~
nomic sanctions, America should
not remove Hussein ’s regime. How
many lives should be sacrificed to
preserve our oil interests?

War is too costly to the Ameri--
can people. After the defeat of
Hussein, other Middle Eastern
despots will continue to blackmail
oil consuming counuies. However.
it the United States implements an
aggressive energy program, the
price of oil will tumble and America
