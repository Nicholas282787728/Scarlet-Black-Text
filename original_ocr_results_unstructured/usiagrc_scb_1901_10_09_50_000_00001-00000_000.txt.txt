GRINNELL DEFEATS DRAKE

Wins the Practice Game by a Score or
o to siDrake Scores on a
Goal rrorn Fierd.

In the annual practicegariie rvitli
Drake University at Des Monies
last Saturday night, Grinnell came
out winner by the score of 6 to 5.

From the spectators' standpoint
the game was unsatisfactory. The
ﬁeld was very unevenly lighted
and as many of the most interesb
ing plays were made at the dark
end of the ﬁeld, the ordinary our
looker was obliged to take much
tor granted. Even when the ball
was in the well-lighted parts of the
ﬁeld the players were usually so
nearly hidden by the clouds of
dust that the plays could not be
followed,

But notwithstanding these did}
culties, Grinnell supporters went
home \vell satisﬁed with tile result.
It wasa noteworthy fact that there
was nearly as much rooting for
Grinnetl as for Drake, although
the number of Grinnell students
at the game was very small

The Grirrnell teanr played the
same men throughout, while four
men entered the game for Drake.
This speaks well tor the physical
condition of our men. Trainer
jack Watson was heard toremark
that ﬁve minutes more play would
have been decidedly to Grinuell's
advantage.

The game lacked snap. and was
devoid of brrlliant work. Three
times Drake forced the ball to
Grinnell's to-yard line and each
time was held for downs. If at
these times Drake's generalsliip
had been better, the ﬁnal score
might have been different,

Both the scores were made in
the ﬁrst half, Gritrneil's after nine
tninutes of play At the kickoff
which followed,‘ Grinncll started
the ball toward Drake's goal with
a 25ryard run by Marsh, the long-
est run of the evening. After two
unsuccessful plays Fisk punted to
Drake’s lanyard line. Then by a
sari s of smashes and end runs,
Drake advanced the ball to Grin-
nell's 5-yard line. A penalty of
to yards imporetl on Drake to. an
off-side play saved Grinnell's goal
line from being crossed. Clark
trom the 15-yard litre, kicked a
goal trom ﬁeld. which gave Drake
her only score.

 

In the second hirlf Drake suc~
cecdett twieoinreaclung Gillitrell's
toryard line, but each time lost
the ball on tltiuns. In general the
offense of bryli tennis was stronger
thttn ‘the deiensc, but when the
danger line was reached, Grittnell
showed her ability to put up a
strong defense.

Just at the close of the second
half a drsgracciul incident oer
curred. Referee Lnncwas assault»
ed by Gl'aeser, one or the Drake
'Varsity, who had been watching
the game trom the sidelines and
had become dissatisﬁed with the
referee's decision, Mr, Lane was
rescued from a mob of Drake stu»
dents by the police, and guarded
until the crowd had dispersed,

time he has done considerable leCr

lacob Rris is best known for his
reform work in New York City,atrd
for his writings on slum conditions
there. In the capacity of police
reporter tor the Nam Var/r 5W he
has had amgle opportunity to
study the social conditions which
he has told of ltt his books, “How
the Other Half Lives,“ "Children
of the Poor," “Out of Mulberry
Street,” “Ten Years’ War,” and
”The Making of an American." He
was closely connected with Theo.
Roosevelt in various lines of re-
lorm work dtiiingkoosevelt'sterlii
as police commissioner of New
York, and the two have become
warm personal triends. Writing
in the Mat/rim of last March,
Pres. Roosevelt quotes with ap
proval the characterization ot‘ the
man who speaks of Riis as “the
most useful citizen of New York."
"Those fellow-citizens of Mr.
Rirs,’ " says Mr. Roosevelt, “who
best know his work, ivrll be most
apt to agree with the statement.
The countless cvils which ltrtk in

Mrs. Baltcr’s cminence is in a
form of art that has been too little

who have heard her rtr liei inter-
pretative recitals. and a number of
Grinnell people have, speak other
work as trtlly wonderful. The fol-
lowing word of commendation

self to assure her a crowded house
