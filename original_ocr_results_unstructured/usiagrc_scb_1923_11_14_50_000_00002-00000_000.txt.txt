THE-PRESS CONVENTION.

During the coming wcch end Grin-
ncll will be at home to delegates at-
tending the Press convention. ThesE
delegates will come irom high schools
all over the state and will represent
the journalistic nctivltiss at their own
schools.

It stands to reason that the young
high school men and women who will
be guests of the oollcgc this week end
are the “cream" or their schools.
They are the outstanding individuals
of their own small gTollpsiat least
journalistionlly, and probably in
many other ways. Their very pres‘
ence at the ccnventlon will be indic-
huve oi the progressive aims or their

school and oi the intcrost and enthus-
iasm oi the students themselves.

In considering that Crinncll is 'so
iortunatc as to no the convening camp
er tor the dclcgatcs, we cornc to rcah
izo tho l‘esponsiliilityiand thc on-
pol‘tllnily which the college will have
to extend a most cordial wclconio.
As a studcnt body, We should aim
to show them the greatest possible
hospitality, create in them an inter-
BSD
incidentallyia desire to more Crin—
nell their iutnrc collogc.

This will be the iourth annual cons
and each

in us and in the institution, and

vention to be held here,
year has meant larger and more suc-

Cessful meetings of the visiting stud-A
ents. Each convention has meant

another channel ior furthering the in.
terest of new students in Gl'innell and
of impressing them with the loftyl
ideals, the democracy and the stundr
ards ol quality for which the college
sands. Few greater opportunities
occur in’ the course of the College
year to reach by so direct and person—
al (L method so many" at the best of
the high school students of the stats.

Grinnell should be conscious of the
critical attentinn which will be turn—
all upon her during the days of the‘
Convention, and mako’ E}. Special effort
to verily the reputation which she has
atk'tined in the state for cultural
qualities, ii-lcndlinoss' and the ability
to co—nperate. The result or the con—
ventlon should be that the several
hunderd delegates present will go
back to their respcctiv’c schools with
glowing and enthusiastic accounts of
tho "Pianeel‘ College of the West.”

learning.
The president of a musical organ-
ization may become a. honsc chairman,
automatically bCCnming a. member ol'
the Lcaguc Board or Court, and a
part oi the studcnt Council. In ad-
dition, he or she may be
athletics, interested in journalism, a
society president, a class oiriccr, an
associate member of several minor
organizations, and on half a dozen
committees.

The bcliet that because 3
possesses the ability to be involved
in so great a number of college ac-
tivitics means that the arrangement is
for tho bcst o: the college or ol: the'
individual, is a. mistaken idea. The‘
prevailing conditions center the great-

active in

student

er share oi the College's largest ac-
tivities- on a. very few people, with
oven duplication at leaders. The re—
sult is that sevcrul receive the work
to do because oi the limitation oi
time, iind it possible to do only a
tow things ‘extremely well, frhey
are handicapped both by the variety
oi their activities and the number
and diversity at the
constantly made upon them and
some one the
with which they are attiliated must
receive secondary attention, ‘

While this method permits o
markable development} on the part ot
a single individual, providing or
course that he or she is physically,
able to remain active, there is no op-
portunity for sou—expression on the
part or conntlcss other less outstand-
ing students who fact that they arc
not leaders does not mean that they'
possess ability in any less degree than
the dozen or so who head the school.
but that because o1 certain personal
rctlrlng churcctorlstics and the lack
oi proper opportunity to display their
torcesh have remained unnoticed by
the student body. When these stud—
ents are given a chance for greater
growth and development, they will
have rscoiycd‘tho greatest possible
value troin their college training.
