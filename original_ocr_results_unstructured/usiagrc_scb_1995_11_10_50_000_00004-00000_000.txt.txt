ﬁlm: Clueless

Clueless, according to Rollin”
Stone is about “a sell»consun\ctl,
materialistic, thoughtless teen [Cher]
who, with the help ofplor twists and
sight gags, becomes a selfconsnmed,
materialistic, thoughtful teen."

The writer, Amy Heckerling
(who also directed this movie anti
Fast Times at Ridgeiriorit High), is
certainly not clueless shout the com.
ic language that reachesout to Amerr
icans today as the movie is written

with Beverly Hills 90s talk.

The soundtrack from the movie
is also certainly not cluclcss ahout
pop culture of today, With songs by
ﬁllSobule, Luscious jackson and
Counting Crows: , the movie also
pleases the musical tastes of today‘s
youth, and anyone else who enjoys
the pop/alt scene,

To quote from the may re review
the English department released,
“Jane Austen's Emma has become
CIueIess,. Emma has become Cheri
and even more clueless. Emma’s
l—lighhury becomes Chet’s Beverly
Hills. Mr. Knightly becomesiwell,
that‘s enough becoming: you have to
see it."

Cultural ﬁlm :
Shoot the Piano
Player

Truffaut‘s second film. and his
first great tribute to the American
rilin tradition which inspired him
Edouard saroyaii (Charles
Arnavour) is the piano player who
alternately poses as a concert pim
nistaiidasCharlieKohler. a honkyu
tonk performer. The film investi—
gatcs the mystery of Edouatd's dual
identity, and asks whether high and
popular art can be brought together.
Questions of genre are paramount
forTruﬂaut in this film. as he works
to meld the American genre ortiliri
noirand the Hitchcocktansuspense
film with the subtle art of Renair,
These generic meldings are com
pared directly to the identity crisis
onthepartofTrutfaut'sprotagonist,
with remarkable results, including a
chase scene that brings together the
conventions ofthegangsterftlmwith
the most profound ponderings of a
Renoir film.

Bad Boyz

Well what can 1 say about this
movie that I haven’t already said I
saw this him last year artd revrewed it
last year aitd it was awful. I have
since heard that it did reasonably
well and a sequel is planned; i am
confounded, The premise of the
movie made no sense \Vill Smith
and Martin Lawrence have to recov—
er drugs that were stolen from the
Miami narcoticsdivisionorthe dwi—
sion Will be shut down for good,
WhatYShut down the narcotics divi-
sion inMiami? Well there are lots of
other stupid plot complications like
that, and sol couldn't swallow it, But
if you can, then go and try and rind
humor in this action film that is a
sampler of every other major recent
action film.

Comment (Mateo): lwouldlike
to take this time to respond to our
Critics. lt's nice [0 know people read
our review and feel strongly enough
about it to votce their opinions. In
fact, last week‘s letter to the editor
was very coherent in comparison to
most other letters. unfortunately, it
had to resort to name calling~eg
“shows how ignorant the person (me)
is about issues of race ” Well, that’s
really sad. I’m going to try an exper—
iment where I'll take the advice of-
fered and put myopinions onspecific
topics where they belong. Let’s see
Just what topics are really controver—
sial today, shall we.

Indochine

The plot ofthis film was hard to
discern. i think that it was about a
native princess who grew up in the
house ofone ofthe rich land-owners
in French Indochina, She became a
folk hero when she revolted against
the French and jotned the commu—
nist revolution, Don’t quote me on
this because she wasn't the central
character Her adoptive mother. the
rich French land-owner, was This
movie was incredibly long. and once
again the audience was forced to root
for a suicide or other merciful death,
only to end it quickly. I couldn‘t
understand all of the pointless sub<
plots and the ﬁrst 2 hours before the
actual central plot began. There was
lots of fantastic cinematography
though. Iiust wtsh someone had writ—
ten something to go With it

Counterpoint (Mitten): This
movie is about a French woman who
adopts an Asian daughter and falls in
love with a French naval officer who
later falls in love with her daughter,
allplacedinthecontextoftheendoi
French occupation or lndoChina.
Well. being ignorant, l don’tknow if
I could possibly place my vrews in
opposition of the majority and of
SOCteml norms, so I will contorm my
opinions to suit the masses and avoid
controversy. Ofcourse, Iwantyouto
know that these Views are opposite
mine,

This movie was good. ltwasnot

bad. it was well made and well worth
spending 3 hours watching and did
not giie me a bad case or ilie mns.
This movie, It: apposed to making
inc want in die, made me wont to

Boys on the Side

Three ii-uiiiaii go on a road trip
in a anViE which is NOT AT ALL
like Thelma and Louise, though you
might be fooled. Whoop. |lic Icsbl»
an, Drew ihe rlruggit slut, Mary the
AIDS victim, Nick the ignorant and
abusive boyfriend, Abe Lincoln the
slow, ignorant, dim.witted but good
natured cop, Chachi the rough
around the edges ignorant Italian
with a heart oigold, I’aco the illegal
alien, and Norm the ignorant tat guy
who drinks beer are characters in
this movte that men are not meant
to understand because. as Mary states,
“like speaks to lit-o". I,however,spit
on that I thought the movie was
pretty good. Since rm ignorant, you
might be inclined to think “you
couldn’t possihly understand the
plight of women." But I feel I did.
Oh wait, did i mention that you see
Drew naked TWICE!

Basketball Diaries

Ok, this is a film about drug
addiction. That’s all, nothing else,
no wisdom passed down fromexperi—
ence, no social comment, no bril-
liant depiction ofa human conquer-
ing his dependency, iusr Leonardo
DiCaprio as a druggte. Leonardo
hreakinginto hurldingstostealmon-
ey for drugs. getting kicked of the
basketballteamandlosinghischance
to go to college because of drugs.
Leonardo letting strange men suck
his dick in the New York City sub«
way for money, Leonardo frothing at
the mouth as he tries to break his
addiction and fails. Then a quick
wrap up that says he made it, but fails
to show it or make any comment.
Leonardo is good in this film, he is
almost always good, without hint i
wouldn't have cared for the film at
all out as is, 1 generally liked it.
Don't EXpECl too much from this
one, Just go and go high.

Comment (Mateo): lcanhe pto<
ressional, even though l don’t get
paid for the many hours I spend a
week doing these revicws, so I will
“leave [my] personalcomments about
multiculturalism in the editorial sec»
tron."

EDITORIAL SECTION

(Mateo) Multiculturalism,
while it can be a good thing, can also
be a had thing. While some people
feel it is important. other people
don‘t. Some people feel that it leads
(0 a disproportional variety orcourt—
esand that it excludesmanycultures
while emphasizing other ones and
therefore, can be very unfair, while
others disagree.

(Taylor) I’m with you on this
one buddy; I love/hate multicultur—
alism; it rocks/sucks. I think that it
does worlds of good/evil. and I could
never stand to be wtth/wtthout it.

Out chick ﬂick pick ofthe week
is Now and Then . The good news is
that this movie unites nearly every
actress in Hollywood; the bad news is
that it doesn't do it very well. The
cast includes young. upand—coming
Christina Ricci and actresses at the
heights ottheir careers such as Mel.
anithiffith,RosieO’Donnell,Demi
Moore and, aged like a fine wine,
Cloris Leachman. In addition to
spanning these generations of ac—
ltesses, it cameos icanne Gatoralo
and Bonnie Hunt (graduate ofjen's
high school). The movie is unique
in its portrayal of the relationships
between women, unobscured by an
overriding emphasis on men.

The young actresses play four
twelve yeanold suburbanite girlswho
become (asr triends as they weather
personal hardships together. The
older actresses play the young girls'
adult counterparts. The main char.
acters are: Samatha, intense reader
and believer in the super—natural;
Teeney, would—be Hollywood star.

and Roberta,rhedeathobsessedtom—
boy. The ﬁlm moves between their
past remembrances and theirpresent
experiences, hence the name.

Enduring the problems ofyouth
such as a parent‘s death, their pat»
ents' divorce, first kisses, and freaky
old menwho tidethcirbikesthrough
cemeteries, the movie is supposed to
mirror the emotional rollercoastcr
that is adolescence. Unfortunately,
saccharine sweetness often coats the
true emotions that the moVie tries so
hard to convey. A few scenes do
work, but part of the problem arises
from the movre’s attempts to appeal
to both mothers and datighters alike.
The sweetness ofthe movie was of—
ten too much for the mother, and
perhapsnotenoughforthedaughter.

A poor imitation of the [elevk
sion series Sisters, Now and Then
has the emotional punch of a phone
commercial. However, there are a
few poignantscenessuch as the birth

were generally unimpressed.
