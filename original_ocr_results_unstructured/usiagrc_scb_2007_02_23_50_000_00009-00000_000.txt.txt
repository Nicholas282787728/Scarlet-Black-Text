Dining memories of yore

Last Tuesday. as I was walking with the better part of the
Grinnell Siiigcrs from Buckshiium to the JRC for dinner aftei
rehearsal, i looked rrp ahead at the rest of the group and felt
iinotlict wave of piecinptivc nostalgia. A first-year tenor was
hopping and shouting, inciting laughter from a group of junior
girls. one oiour tiniest altos was giving a ﬁrsltycar bass about
srv, staggering steps of a piggyback ride. We were laughing
and singing little bits of the Handel
masterpiece we’d just finished, and
not one of us had stoned to think
about the stiesses ofthe coining CVC-
ning. Although it was still painfully
cold out, the singers were strolling
taking the same easy, rambling pace
wed always taken. we passed the
aftei-houis calm of the Noyce constiuction site and I thought
for a moment about some of the “standard” experiences of the
Grinnell expel'icnc * hose myriad little habits that combine to
tap out the rhythm ofour college life,

I realized that I've walked to the dining hall for four years’
worth of singers’ dinners. We used to take the short walk to
(brad, up toward the libraiy and down the slippery path to the
tiain tracks. Other, oldei tenois used to hop and shout and
make the girls laugh. I remember stashing coats and bags on
hooks in (l\C tiny vestibule, and looking forward to the warm,
yellow light ofCAlad, ifriot the food. People would get unrcat
sonably excited about things like chicken patty paimesan, and

we ate from heavy, round ceramic plates. The napkins were
kept in little wine baskets and there was a (gasp!) doritryoursclf
deli bar The singers, as well as many, smaller groups of friends,
would stay at those long, dark tables far longer than was near
cssary, eating watery soft serve and pushing back against the
inevitable homework Witching hour.

Today, aside from a shiily, new locatien and fancier stinfry,

very little has actually changed. it
an experience that obraously extends
far- beyond the singers, Sports teams
enjoy a similar plicnomenon,walking
to dinner, famished, with ice strapped
to then vaiious injuiics.’l‘hcycat with
c , theii teammates and ielax into easy,
' post-practice conversation. Members
of campus organizatlnns, groups of
fuseyear floormates and clusters of close friends gather for a
casual hour before the meetings, symposium talks and mentor
sessions begin, New singers, athletes and groups come to dinner
each year and eventually the rookie grows up and becomes the
captainThe firsttyear singer becomes a section leadei,walks to
dinner with the choir at 6:00 on Tuesday and Thursday nights,
and graduates a few shoit years later.

I can’t stay forever, and I wouldn't want to, but many years
from now I'll take a measure of comfort in the thought of a
whole new crop of singers and soccer players, strolling up to
the JRC’OI whatevei else they've built by then m for a lazy,
winter dinner.

A mural representing diversity on campus

The Student Organization of Latinas/
os (SOL) prides itself on the diversity of its
members. our backgrounds vary, from Latinos
and non‘Latinos born in the us, to Spanish
natives and Latin American citizens. Many
students are involved in SOL because they
find a “home" away from home, while otht
ers are attracted to the actiVities, activism and
education about inembets'various culnires and
lifestyles. For most SOL members, the SOL
meetings (held on Thursdays at 9 pm, in ch
227) also serve as an hour offun, accompanied
by laughter and good conversation.

The point here is that SOL is diveise and
continues to promote diversity while eradicat-
ing misconceptions about the organization
and its members. This letter to the cdiloi’ is
specifically in response to the SEa’B's mural
article last week, which included only a small
portion ofthe significant imagery represented

in the mural. While Ccsar Chavez, the city of
Xochimiico in Mexico and Diego Rivera are
great figuies in our history, they do not fairly
represent Hispanic culture, Latin American
culture or the cultural history of our members
The exclusive allusion to the Mexican symbols
goes against the very spirit of the mural. The
mural is intended, in part, to be as inclusive as
possible of Latino and Hispanic cultures and
the omission of these important elements in
the article left an incomplete picture.

The symbols and images are not exclusively
tied to the herihige of our members, although
some are very representative. Instead, some of
these cultural symbols are of interest to our
members and deserve recognition. A few of
the icons. symbols, and other cultural elements
included are the AfmtAntillano people from
Panama, the orchid and coffee bean plants,
which are national symbols of Colombia, the

great volcanoes of El Salvador, the long-tailed
Qietzal from Ccntial America and also the
national symbol of Guatemala; the sugar cane
and plantain symbols which are indicative of
the plantation industry established throughout
Latin Ameflcﬂilnﬂiﬂly in central and South
Americuiduring the colonial years, and
Guernica (a town in northern Spain) regarded
by Spaniards as the symbol ofBasque national
identity and Spanish cultural diversity.

As a student expecting to graduate in 89
days (and still counting),1 (Melina) have Witt
ncssed the misconceptions associated with
SOL throughout my time in Grinnell. Many
students have held the impression that SOL
is a “Mexicantclub",whieh is the very miscon-
ception i would like to overcomeThe purpose
ofSOL is to create a community that nurtures
cultural piide and awareness amongst all its
members. We resolve to create and support a

ciiltuial and social network that preserves and
encourages cultuial identity and autonomy,
promotes awareness of political and social is-
sues affecting Latino society, and serves as an
educational resource for the community

in this response, we wanted to elaborate
on the mui'al’s diverse imagery in order to
acknowledge and more thoroughly include
Hispanic and Latino cultures. This project is
a prime example of how our community can
coalesce to maintain a sense of unity, while
simultaneously promoting cultural awareness
and dialogueThe mural is now hanging in the
SOL office in JRC 209L and the SOL mem-
bership welcomes anyone interested (so come
check it out anytiine!).

On the implications of prrvrlege and status at Grinnell

The 100 days senior party has conic and gone, indicating
that my stay here at Grinnell is quickly coming to an end, Rct
ﬂeeting on the past few years, I find myself returning again
and again to ‘il series of ideas and concerns, which surround
questions about what it means to be a Grinnellian. Do cclccr
tic personalities, which thrive on the pursuit of the unknown,
warrant the enormous benefits Grinnell students so often take
for granted? Choosing to make Grinnell our home for four
years reveals something signiﬁcant about our character. it also
speaks to the kinds of resources, both material and liontmilttr
rial, we have at our disposal.

A harsh reality, which individuals steeped in the ideology
of meritocracy are often unable or unwilling to admit, is that
working hard does not guarantee anyone the success purported
by American idealism and its inherent nptitmsmr People work
hard every dayl Thousands ofpeople pour their lives into Walt
Mart and national fasttfood chains 7 only to remain trapped
in poverty and its ill effects, Countless individuals fill voting
booths every four yeais and give a majoiity of their life’s energy
and time to not only doing their jobs, but to doing them well
7 only to be neglected in old age. The question that I often
find rayselfasking as I walk down the street, through the mall,
or even as I sit in church is what makes me bcttct than othcr
people. On the suiface I say, “Nothing makes me better than
anyone else. I’m human and make mistakes just like everyone
else,"

But alas, year's end will arrive and I will sit down in my

cap and gown holding my Grinnell college degree. Won’t I,
as a Grinnell alumnus, be different, set apart and among the
best and brightest in America? Yes, our students arr: different,
faculty and administration say. At G ncll College, we prot
mote social justice, equality and work toward the elimination
of homophobia and racism, All these statements are true on
some level, yet I have found that a mindset of entitlement and
meritocraey flourishes alongside stridents' efforts to expose in~
justice and to empower the win-l ’s neglected, oppressed and
abused pcoplcr

Does believing that our knowledge and life achievements
result from our own hard work require us simultaneously to are
tribute the poveity and ignoiance of others to personal deﬁcits
and/or to a refusal to work haid? The Cl‘lumctcilstlcs which set
us, as Grinnell students, apart from othei people aie for the
most part good characteristics,which Grinnell should continue
to cultivate. However, as we celebrate oirr uniqueness, are we
also obligated to acknowledge and understand how so much of
who we are is determined by things over which we have little
oi no control family, resources, racism, neighborhood, school?
Our willingness to work hard and sleepless deﬁnitely impacts
oirr level of achievement, but our work ethic represents only
one variable in the large equation of life, purpose and lmpplr
ricss, or as we have learned so much about at recent convoca-
tions » vocation. Our access to resources and opportunities,
or the lack thereof, complements our personal autonomy and
individuality.

Oui life experiences and historics make us Griiiiiellians and
inform arii understandings as human beings trying to make the
world a better place to live. We should not fccl ashamed about
the privileges we experience as Grinnell students or about the
role orhcr‘ benefits have played in shaping who we are. We
should instead acknowledge the impact of cxlernul influences
on our lives, so that we can transform our ideological flamer
works of nieritocraey into more compassionate frameworks
that make it easier for us to see the suffering we create as well
as the suffering inflicted by others. This compassionate frame-
work recognizes the powerlessness of the world's disenfrarr
chised people and invites us to help empower individuals to
realize their human potential.

Young people 7 from Georgia to New Guinea, from Kenya
to Virginia 7 are working extremely hard at different things all
efwhich will not lead to academic preparation that will enable
them to endure the rigor of Grinnell College. No one in the
world deserves a Giinncil education,th here I am. Why am
I here and not someone else.> over the course of my life and
especially during my time at Grinnell,1 have learned that ifl
grew up in a different family, in a different school, in a different
eountry,iri a different time.l could be the very person or people
i critiCize and hope never to become, I, like so many citizens
in the richest country in the world, could be stuck in a vicious
cycle ofpovcrty, illiteracy, ignorance and injustlcc,yct here I am
reading the we.
