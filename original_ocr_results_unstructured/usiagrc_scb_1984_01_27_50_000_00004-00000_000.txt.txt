The draft - an idea whose time has passed

Today marks the eleventh anniversary
of the end of the military draft in the
United States; an event that marks both
an all-too—rare enlightened approach to
the handling of this country’s military
force and as a guarantee to its draft—age
men that they will not have to deal with
involuntary conscription.

Though skeptics didn’t give too much of
a chance when it began, the voluntary
enlistment process has proven to be an ef-
fective means of running the armed
forces. This experiment in elective
soldiering has been a success, when used
properly, at protecting and helping needy
American citizens and American in-
terests abroad.

Involuntary conscription was brought
to an end during the Nixon era at a time
when U.S. involvement in Vietnam was
still a fresh wound for Americans,
whether they evaded the draft, went to
Southeast Asis or were forced to wait for
their loved ones who left home. The Kent
State Massacre was almost three years
old when the draft was ended, yet it focus-
ed and heightened widespread mistrust
and hatred in America of all things
military more than any other single
event, In many circles, burning one’s

draft card was perhaps the most signifi-
cant act that a young man could make.
And here at Grinnell, the anger of the day
was reﬂected every bit as strongly as was
possible at a tiny, Midwestern, liberal
arm college.

The situation in American and the rest
of the world has changed, however, and
resenting the military establishment no
longer appeals to an increasingly large
number of people. For many of them,
there is a great deal of merit in becoming
a soldier, Much of this sentiment, which
is manifested in draft-age males as well
as older people, came about at the same
time that the Americans in Iran were
seized in 1979. This is when President
Carter reinstated draft registration.
Despite fears by some that a new draft
was imminent and the objections by
others to any adjustments in the Selective
Service System, draft registration has
been accepted by most people and is

generally regarded as a success.

As the situtaiton stands now, there is
really no reason to return to the old—
fashioned draft. There are enough men
and women in the armed forces to ade»
quately protect U.S. interests at home
and abroad, and there would be not

storage of volunteers if the country
should need additional forces (which is
very unlikely), The people who are in the
service are there because they want to be
and make better soldiers than resentful
draftees would.

There are those, however, who favor
reinstitution of the draft. One of these
people is Democratic presidential can-
didate Senator Ernest Hollings of South
Carolina. Hollings referred to today’s
system as “an armed job corps” in the
Dartmouth debate two weeks ago, What
Hollings‘ statement does not address is
the fact that any faults in the system are
due to poorly educated troops, which is a
result of a subpar U.S. educational
system, and poorly cared-for troops,
which is due to incompetence in the
military establishment. A return to the
draft would do nothing to increse the
strength or preparedness of America’s
armed forces.

Eleven years have passed during which
this country has not had involuntary con—
scription. It is a credit to this country that
for men, ages 18-22, and hopefully for all
those who someday will be of draft age,
there is a choice of whether or not to
serve their country by toting a rifle.

The White House takes a step back

seems to be learning little about running a progressive
government,

About the only good news that can be gleaned from the
departure of William French Smith from his poition as At-
torney General and his subsequent replacement by
Presidential Advisor Edwin Meese is that it removed a
Reagan crony from office.

The entire Reagan administration has been one long
roll-back of progressive measures designed to protect the
public. The appointment of William Ruckelshause to
replace Anne Gorsuch Burford at the Environmental Pro~
tection.Agency (EPA) is one in which a person with
moderate policies received an executive position for the
Reagan White House.

James Watt’s replacement at Interior, William Clark, is
not an improvement over what the country had been faced
with. Clark is quite close to the president and so far has
done little to modify Watt’s dangerous, shortsighted en-
vironmental policies, despite the loud public outcry that
existed before Watt mercifully stepped down. This in
stance, like others before and after it, shows that Reagan

The latest executive shuffling takes out of office a man
who, with Reagan’s blessings, reversed important civil
rights measures and turned a blind eye to potential anti-
trust activity. Instead, the Justice Department will now
be headed by a man who insists that there is no hunger in
America, helped the president reshape the compositon of
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and tried to get other
regressive measures passed in Congress.

Meese’s desire to maintain strict lawiand-order policies
and institute victim compensation measures at Justice is
honorable, but the fact remains that he has proven
himself insensitive to the needs of so many Americans. It
remains a great paradox how Reagan can claim to be try»
ing to make a better life for the people while he and his ap-
poinitees reverse progressive gains made during previous
administrations. The Reagan White House still has a long
way to go before it can take one step forward.
