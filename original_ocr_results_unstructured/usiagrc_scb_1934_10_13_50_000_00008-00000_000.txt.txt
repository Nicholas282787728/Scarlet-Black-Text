applications for jobs available were
double the numbcr possible to fill.

Financial need, scholastic record and
priority of application were thc factors

because of ovcrilow requests the work
has in many cases been divided bee

Now Jobs Expected

In davising this plan to increase
college enrollment, the Educational
Department of FERA voiced the hope
that jobs allotted would be new ones,
that work in the fields of education,
government and social service at pre-
sent left entirely undone should be
devised for students benefiting from
the appropriation, Surveys of housing
conditions, election registration checks,
investigations of social needs, appren»
ticcships to government officials, posts
in literacy classes are a few of the
possibilities which orginators of the
plan had in mind.
