Letters from the Old World

Part VII—Strange English Ways
By Riva Sharples, Foreign Correspondent

 

 

England. Almough it’slaken meawhile,l ﬁnally am beginning togrow used tosomeofthe weirdEnglish ways.
However, some practices like putting vinegar on french fries, or chips as they call them here, I don't think I'll
ever be able to understand or accept.

There is not much variety in the food here. Everything is either fried or baked. The staple for Brits is ﬁsh and
chips, fish Cakes, sausage rolls and pies ranging from steak and kidney to potato and meat to chicken and mushroom.
It’s funny. but the staple for most Americans here has been ramen noodles, just like at Grinnell.

The English are obsessed with fish and chips. When people back in the States told me that the English liked
their chips, I didn’t realize the implications of that. There seems to be a ﬁshrandrchips shop on every comer, even
in the smallest villages and burghs. English blokes are constantly talking about going down to the “chipper” or
“Chippy” to getsome “real food". There is even a fish»andrchips shop on campus that is open from 7:00 until 11:15
every evening (even on Sunday, when everything else here on campus IS locked down tightl)

At ﬁrst. I didn’t like Lhe nauseating greasy smell that waited through the air near fish»andrchips shops, but now
I’ve grown quite used to it, and I, right along with otherAmericans who have been here formonths now, find myself
growing accepting andeven excited at the sightofsaturatcd chips (the fish still docsn'tgrab me). The English don‘t
likekeichupatall, so it’s often notavailable. Ifitis available, itcomes in those tiny, hardrtoopen packets that squirt
everywhere (you know. the kind that you get in the driverthrough at fast food restaurants that make you curse when
you open them) and costs seven to ten pence per packet. Once you pay extra for the ketchup and successfully get
it open, often it is very sweet, and not very tomatoey tasting at all.

TheEnglish like to eat on the run,even more sothan Americans. Fish -and-chips shops are usually small,Mum»
and~Pop establishments that offer take-outservice only. Fish—and-chrps are thrown ontoapicce of butcher's paper,
automaticallydoused with vinegar(unlessyou are quick enough to stop tltcm),zind rolled up intoaneatbundle. Most
people take Ihe bundle and eat it with their hands as they walk down the street. Less skilled people like me, who
find itdiffrcult to eat and walk at the same time. end up huddling together in the cold, wet weatherjust outside the
shop, trying to gulp down thebuming,greasychrpsbeforcwegettoocold. Ifwearelucky enough to ﬁnda restaurant
that offers dine»in service, there are two prices on the menu: one for carry-out and the other for dincrin, which
sometimes costs up toone~fourth more than carry-out. Even McDonald’s dinerin is more expensive than carry-out!

Food isn’t the only strange thing about this country. The English electrical system operates on a 220»volt
system, versus our 110»volt system. which means that anything brought from the United States must have a special
converter. And even then. it won’twork unless you’ve turned on the electricity. The first Iimel used a toaster, I
waited ten minutes for the toast to brown before I discovered that the electricity wasn‘t turned on. Although the
toaster was plugged in. the small switch next to the plug was not in the“on" position. This "safety feature” is adaily
frustration for me and a source of my British floorrnates‘ irritation with me. Ijust can‘t remember to turn off the
electricity when I’m ﬁnished with ii,and so they are continually irritated erh I.heir“wasteful American" floomtute.

Thephonesystem here is frusu'atingaswell. Imiss being abletomakephone calls like back in goodoldGr-innell.
Students at the University do not have individual phones in their rooms. There is one phone in each hall that offers
noprivacyaiall,butitdoesn‘tmattersincenooutgoingcallscanbemade from itanyway. If Iwanttoeall offcampus
to order pizza (nota good idea: the English idea of pizza is ummm . . . different) or to call the States, I must trek over
to the porter‘s lodge and queue in line for a public phone. In order to use the public phone, you must also have a
phone card, which you must have purchased in advance because the poner‘s supply is bound to be depleted. The
card isinserted into the phone before youdral, and then, as you talk,a little window on the phone displays how many
units of time you have left. When you call the States, the number in the window goes crazy and the sound ofyour
hard-cameo money clicking away is so distracting and distressing that it‘s hard to have a normal conversation.

Theother day Jason and I were in the kitchen making grilledchecse sandwiches and soup. J.P. and Simon, two
Brits who live on Jason’s floor. came into the kitchen. Seeing our sandwiches grilling nicely in the skillet, JP. said
in disbelief,“Whar are youdoing? Areyou fryingchoesc?” And then they both burst into laughter (actually, [should
say theychucklcd: Britisharetoorescrvcdandpropcrtoburstinto anything). Notonlydid they find theidcaoifrying
cheese hilarious, but they also thought our temiinology for such a sandwich was strange and so Jason and I ended
up having a friendly argument with them about grilled versus fried cheese. They couldn’t understand why it was
called grilled cheese, when it was actually fried. “You Americans just can’t get your English right." they said to us.
“We tried to teach you for 200 years before we let you go. but I guess you all are still struggling along.”

America's “handicap" in learning “proper English" seems to be a big topic of discussion here and the British
love tojoke with us Americans about it. lescape the frequent jokes and ridicule by traveling often: next week, I‘ll
write about my adventures wiLhJason in Glasgow, Scotland. Until then,be thankful thedining hall serves morethan
fish and chips! (Editor's note: Guess what'rfor lunch loday?)

I ’8 been nine (sometimes very long) weeks that I’ve been studying here at Lancaster University in Lancaster,
