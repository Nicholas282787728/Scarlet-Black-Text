Swimmers Preparelfor lavtrgntq .

Grinnell's varsity swimming
team toolr to the water last
week, tor their first otticial
praétice of the 1953-54 season,
which is scheduled to open He-
cember 5 against Lawrence.

Twelve Candidates

At present Coach lrv Simone
has 12 mermen listed on his
varsity roster. six ot whom are
seniors (Barry Lawrence, Wal-
ter Brcgden, Bill Hejna, Dave
Brown, Pete vassilairos, and
Andy Hassopulos.) Five sopho-
mores, (Torn Heina, Joel Stubos,
Doug Bannister. Tom Howeil,
and John Pike) and a junior
(Howie Runyan) tom the re-
mainder of the team.

Lawrence, a distance swim»
mer, and Eragden, a utility
man, are co-captains of the
Pioneer aqua troop. Coach
Simone said that he lost the
best breastrstroker in the his-
tory of the school when Harold
Matheson, a sophomore, trans.
tered to Iowa State.

Not As Strong

Simone also stated that this
year's outfit lacks the strength
last winter’s squad boasted,
which triumphed in eight of
nine dual meets, and erased
three-fourths at the school’s
age-old records. He does believe

 

however, that the squad at hand
is capable ot winning the greater
percentage or its scheduled en-
counters.

The clash with the Vikings
will be the curtain-raiser of
nine dual meets, which will be
climaxed March 6. when the
Midwest Conference gathering
will be held at Cornell's newly
dedicated pool in Mt. Vernon.
Last year the Pioneers faltered
at the wrong time ,and finished
fourth in the league meetr

Knox ls Favorite

According to pro—season prog—
nostications, Knox college is
supposed to unfold the lcop's
strongest team, while Carle—
ton, who administered Grinnell
its only setback in ’52, always
“pools” a good squad.

“The team will have an added
incentive to worlr tor this year,”
said Coach Simone. The Vextra
goal is in the farm of an award
tabbed as the ”Bob Ross Tro-
phy.” Ross, a ’53 grad, cap—
tained last winter’s team. He
left no hlazing records trailing
behind him, hut as Simone
worded it, “Bob was a swimmer
who was short on talent, but
unmatched in intestinal forti-
tude."

Midway through the quarter

Pioneer guard Steve McCormick
intercepted a pass on the Man»
mouth 45 to send the Pioneers on
the way to their third scoring
effort, the touchdown coming
on a 3 yard pass from Norton to
Ryan. The extra point failed, but
the Pioneers led at halftime

Monmouth Rollie-s

The third quarter was quite
a ditterent story, however. A
very strong Scot running ztlr
taclr coupled with a Grinnell
fumble gave Monmouth a touch-
down with only three minutes
gone in the second half. Dorste
scored from the one foot line
after several long gains had put
the hall in scoring position, The
running attempt tor the extra
point tailed.

Late in the third period the
Scots again hit pay dirt with
a 50 yard Dorste to Read pass,
very similar to the play that
Monmouth scored on in the first
quarter. Again the extra point
attempt was no good and Grin-
nell still led 1948i
