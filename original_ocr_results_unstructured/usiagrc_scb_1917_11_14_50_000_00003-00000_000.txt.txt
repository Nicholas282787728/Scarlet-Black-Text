Has In Government

“1 have no raith in any concert or
world powers in which Jesus or Name
reth has no place," said Dr. E. A. St. -
her in res‘pers Sunday, where he pi'cc
sented some or the ideas which, as he
said, increased the burden laid on the
nrcphet’s heart.

"There is," he continued, "one ques-
tion for Germany, England, France,
‘and the United States to as What
place shall Jesus have in government.
in business, and in social life? The
world does not need this or that teach
ing oi Chii,st but Christ in toto It
needs the full Gospel of Jesus Chr 1:"

Another tact which increases the
anguish of the Prophet's burden is
“that the aii-ognncc of nations, races
and classes is as yet unmitigated by
Christ's teachings, We see it," he said,
"among the t -nicniaus, the Belgians.
Not all the waters of the sea will wash
away this stain. it reveals the guilt
of Chi'stian people everywhere, the
sin which is inst as great. here as else-
where."
