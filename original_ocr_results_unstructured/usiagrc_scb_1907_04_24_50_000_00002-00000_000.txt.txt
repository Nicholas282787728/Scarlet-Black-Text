The Spirit or complaint.

For the last year or two there has
been manifested in Iowa. College a
disposition to inject into class can
tests all: unatural feeling that to win
is all. Much discussion has been con-
ducted concerning qualiﬁcations for
competition in class athletics. and
last [all it was found necessary to
irame a code of rules stating rust
where an athlete should stand in the
way or credils in order to compete
with a given class. Taking: it for
granted that this has settled the
eligibility question, it must be non-
{essed that there is still evident on
the part of some it disposition to keep
the old class Ieuds alive.

The continual ”raggrng“ winch has
followed almost every class contest
since last spring shows a pettiness of
spirit and a narrowness of mind
which has no place in Iowa College.

Not only are the members of com-
plaininxz classes to be blamed but
members of the student body as a

. whole Villa continually help circulate
the idea that ulllaii‘ means have been
used to Win athletic contests ale even
more detrimental to [lie Interests of
the school.

It isshameful in a high degree to
use underhand methods to win a race
or a game: in this we all agree. It is
iully as shamelul to propagate the
idea that a class which has Once done
so will always employ thesame means.
Hard as it may he to lose a contest
where the Winner has not been on the
square, still it is an empty honor to
have such a contest once lost awarded
on that ground. Neither side wins
anything either way. Class contests
should be kept clean as much on the
basis that It. harms both sides to Win
nniairly as on the ground that it, is
unjust to the losing side.
to win or loose a game which isn't on
the square Let's have no more.or
this Complaining. It does no good.
lor the greatest harm is already ir-
reparablynonc Those who are to
blame tor the harm, ii there is any,
will get their dues in full anyway,

The next two months are likely
to be the busiest in the icrm of public
entertainments. societathleclc and
musical events which Griilnell has

.One or the many instances of the
close relation between utlllohics and
nrenlcl training at Iowa College is to
be round in the iact that a prominent
athlete carried 011' a 330 public speak-
ing prize last. Thursday night.
