Radical cheerleader to save world

"Mostly vegetarian" hopes to save forests, fight for feminism and dance the night away

 

She's smart, she’s cute, she’s political to
boot} She’s Susan Hildebrand, a political sei-
euce major and native lowan who’s changing
our world one cheer at a time.

or course, anyone who's ever met Hilr
debrand will agree that she’s not your aver-
age cheerleader—although she does have the
energy for it. However. for the times when
forests are being torn down and native homer
lands are being destroyed, Hildebrand will
always be ready with a cheer. “I'm really into
iadical cheerleadilig. It's exactly what I think
should happen in
the world," she said
“Glitter and human
pyramids. You cant
beat that." In her time
at Grinnell. she’s been
active in clubs such as
Free the Planet, Stun
dents Against swear-
shops, Latin American Solidarity Group and
DVA/SAC. promoting both social and envin
ronmcntaljusuce.

While Hildebrand now uses radical cheers
to promote social justice, she was not always
an active environmentalist, She grew up on a
farm in what she jokingly hkcs to call “a sub
tirb of VVoolstock, Iowa," (VI/oolstock has a
population ofapprorimately 200 people) and
had big dreams of becoming a gymnast. “1

always wanted my parents to move to Texas
and let me train with [world-renowned Ros
manian gymnastics coach] Bela Karoiyi," she
said. “[But] I hear that he’s really abusive, it's
probably good that that didn't happen "

Hildebrand always held an interest in
social justice, and in high school, she discoie
ered her hero, Kathleen Hannah of the bands
Bikini Kill and Le Tigre. Hannah was coin
sidered one of the leading icons in tic 90s
feminist movement. She was like my saving
grace in high school, said Hildebrand “She

was radical and angry
g and also empowering
l and really run all at
. ‘ r the same time, which
by A," Sager“ is everything I think
- feminism and activ-
ism shouidl )e

Once Hild ud
discovered activism
could he a career, there was no turning back,
At first she thought she wanted to work for
labor rights, and while working with skihskih
for a summer in Latin America, she discov—
ered that environmental degradation was a
big problem in the areal‘he nextsummershe
canvassed with a Grinnell alum on the din»
gers of global warming. “That was my awa ..
ening into environmentalism," she said.

Next year, Hildebrand will be working

with Green Corps, doing a yearlong training
program to become an environmental orga-
tiizer, “I want to work with an organization
that sees [antiroppi-ession work and environ-
mentalism] as combined .rnd combats them
at the- same rimc,"shc said.

In addition to her activist work, Hildeb-
rand has many other goals tor the fururo, iris
eluding learning to play the guinu. becoming
ﬂuent in Spanish and hiking. “I really hope
someday l"m going to be a luker," she said.
“I have this persona of myself. I can see the
clothes I'm going to have to buy. I'm going
look so cute with a backpack."

Hildebrand may not be ii hiker yet, but
hel gymnastics training has taught her some
serious dance skills. “Dance is a big deal for
me," said Hildebrand, who has performed in
two main stage dance shows at Grinnell as
well as with student- r-un groups 1 like poor
ple touching. I like dance where people are in
phySICal contact with one another," she said
but nervous about sounding creepy. added, “I
like situations where that's appropriate."

Dance has taught Hildebrand companr
iouship and cooperation and has given her a
heightened awareness otpeople Hildebrands
consciousness of others is highlighted by her
InttrLsr in social justice, winch has lead to
some complex feelings about her guinea pig,
Sully, whom shes had since her first vear at
Grinnell “Now, I would probablv not want it
caged animal, because i don t know how fair it
is to Sully," said Hildebrand “But now that I
have hei",I try and treat her as well as I can,”

In the spirit of environmental justice,
l-lildebmud is “mostly" vegetar i n unless
there alc leftovers, “I'd probitblv . vegan if
it wereut for mayonnaise and pudding pops,"
she said, Other items on Hildehi‘aiitl's list of
favorite things are fresh fluil, thunderstorms,
sweater weather, and “playing around in bed.
Preferably with someone else ’"

Perhaps I-Iildebiand's best quality (othcr
than her extremely soft ltni nd sar stie litin
mot) is her abundant energy do get really
excited re illv easily," she sai ,crting dogs and
small children as some ol the causes Unfalr
tunarely, this excitement doesnt always trans-
fer into her opinion ofcriirncil.

Like many seniors Hildebrand has mixed
feelings towards Grinnell College. Giinnell
probably fucked me up it little bit. she said
laughing Burl think it helped me through
that, too." Roi ig that most transitions in
life involve both the good and the bad, Hi1»
dcbrand has remained calm about graduating.
“I'm happy about the way I spent my tune
here. It’s time to vacate the premises," she
said,

I”IllClClJl'all‘ldVS saicastic humor about grad-
uating is mirrored by her- opinion ofthc world
outside of Gririnell, “Everything should be
hm," she said, but after pausing added, “No,
that‘s totally a he,"
