A COMMON PROBLEM ‘

(Reprinted from the Oberlin Review)

The present student generation has no con-
ception of what compulsory chapel means.
Five years ago it was decided by the ad-
ministration that chapel attendance should
not be compulsory because of the unhealthy
attitude that rcsulted‘on the part of the
audience. Since the abandonment of the
former regulations, none of the apathy and
hostility which existed before has been
present. This has given a different signi-
ficance to chapel programs.

When the change in rules was made it
was strongly recommended that students
attend at least three out of four chapels a
week. This was a recommendation and
nothing more. It was hoped that the stu—
dents, realizing the value and importance of
chapel programs, would voluntarily attend.
Each year the attendance has dropped
slightly until now when there are no stu-
dents left from the period when attendance
was compulsory, the chapel is often almost
deserted.

The situation is serious for two reasons.
First, because when strict regulations were
removed students immediately took advan-
tage of their new found liberty and abused

their privileges. Oberlin students cannot
hope to have more complete freedom until
they can show that they know how to use
what they already have. In the second
place, students have completely lost sight
of the significance of a valuable part of
their college education,

If chapel attendance does not improve for
the rest of this year and the first few
months of the fall, there will be no alter-
native but to revive the compulsory atten-
dance regulzltion in some form. This regu—
lation would not be for the purpose of
limiting the liberty of the student body, but
rather it would be for its p ‘otection. >Whe_n
a student comes to Oberlin to obtain his
higher education, the college assumes the
responsibility for seeing that the student
benefits as much as possible from the far
cilities that are provided, If possible, the
college attempts to share this responsl _lty,
but if this becomes impossible there is little
that can be done by the administration ex-
cept to take over the full responsibility.

We therefore urge that the student body
pause for a moment and reconsider the idea
of going to chapel. As was said recently
by a student who had gone for the first
time in many months, “It really isn’t so
bad. All you have to do is sit and listen.”

A DYING INSTITUTION?

Everyone is tired of being told how much
the world has changed since 1900, but we
can’t help mentioning the fact once again
now that ther is a street fair in town. It
is a rather frail undernourished little street
fair which looks as if it had been born too
late in a world too old, But thirty-five
years ago it would have been quite differ-
ent. After a winter of Sunday School plays,
evenings of popping corn at home and
charades (what DID our parents do with
their evenings when they were in college
anyway?), the annual street fair must have
been welcomed. It was welcomed doubt—
fully, to be sure. Ferris wheels and mer y-
go-rounds were all very well, but there was
often gambling too, and people stayed out
too late and drank more l'ootebeer and ate
more cotton candy than was good for them.
But it was worth it, for after the long colol‘r
less pro-Hollywood winter the street fair
meant glamor and gaiety and noise and cone
fusion and fun.

Now we have grown up; we are more
sophisticated at eighteen than our parents
were at twenty-five. The Ferris u ‘Ieel is
not very high to someone who has stood on
top of the Empire State Building or has
been in an airplane; an auto goes faster
than a merry-go-l'ound and is not rooted to
one place. You can buy glamor any night
for thirty-five cents plus the one cent tax
on glamor demanded by the state.

So let us be kind to the little street fair
on Fourth Avenue. It is probably terrified
and confused. And that wheeze you hear—
it is not just the wheeze of the machinery
that runs the meri'y-go—l‘ound; it is the
tuberculous cough of a (lying institution.

 

DORIC

A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

It continues to be one of life’s
little tragedies that all the big
news breaks between Dorics. But
since we don't feel like biting a
dogvyet~w€ll give out with our
own caustic comments on current
comedies.
a a x<

in a land of borrowed ideas, the
Dibble man who borrowed every—
thing except shorts to go to the
house party deserves special recA
_ognition. This is it.

THIS AND DITHER: Wewnultln’t
have believed ', but Pat Black
missed the point in our little
comment on the Cyclone hunt. Or
maybe that was just to make a
good chapel talk . . . Joke of last
week: the way the fair ones must
have looked, staggering into the

 

quad dining room for the promr
ised “hot rolls and fresh straw-
berries," (We would have given
the award to the Beta Sigma
Brotherhood, but we're supposed
to go easy on the Clark boys.)

. . Joke of this week: the fake
“hunt" . . . ’I‘he Doris Anderson-
cnamp Reynolds-Gunner Infelt
affair has us all contused, as she
evidently wants us to be. We’ve
always taken it more or less for
granted that people get engaged
to only one person at one time,
or at least go steady with the
lucky man . . . The laugh’s on
Perkins and Murphy, who started
going steady for a laugh, It seems
that Jake and Mac surprised the
little ladies: they’ve really Got

SWEET MYSTEKIES 01“ um:
We wonder—why a good-looking
number like Connie Thompson
doesn't Get Around more:
Keency doesn't put that
chatter down on paper7
to any mag, and you can close a

 

book any time; why no organized
student effort is made to obtain
a decent cut system; and why
the administration put the clamps
on the use of “blanket party” in
connection With Grinnell. It's
been brought to Doric’s attention
that this school is a piker in that
respect. At Iowa city, they used
to pitch camp in a quar y for
the week-end. Griunell, without
cars, continues to peel oranges,
Doric humbly suggests that one
of Grinnell’s science graduates
dedicate his life to discovering
the cause of and cure tor the
“bug" that lays the campus low
during examsiand we don’t mean
LOVE or STUDY, We mean the
acutely unpleasant malady that
strikes in theiuhinlght.

And it you're planning to go to
Stone's’ in Marshalltown Without
signing out and without permis-
sion to take a car, try not to
meet the dean of men and the
instructor in political science.

 

News Views

Io $250,000,000
Worth Its Price

In Human Blood?
—By w.C.H

Dear Mr. Interventionist:

Your editorial, entitled “Minding
Our Own Business,” in the last
issue of the Scarlet and Black is
a fair sample of the view-point
held by you and your cohorts.
You give us ten results that
you believe the Unitad States
can expect from an isolation-
ist policy: the loss of our world
cotton market, the curmilment
oi our s2,ooo,000,ooo worth or
exports, the loss or 3250410an
in returns from the $6,500,000,-
000 we have invested abroad,
the loss or the world market
ior 50 per cent of our tobacco
and 20 per cent of our wheat,
an increase in tin and rubber
prices, the upsetting effect of
ioreign currency manipulation
on our trade, an increase in
government in business and
added rcgimentation, a rise in
unemployment, the decline of
Brim-r and France, and an in-
creased government budget.

Yes, Mr. lnterventionist, your
paraphrasing from the United
states News may be partly true,
but, rrom our experience of 1917-
18, let us paraphrase ten results
we may expect from your policy:
(1) We can intervene in other
people's troubles it we are pre-
pared to send hundreds of thou-
sands of our finest young men to
die in the mud. (2) We can inter—
vene if we are willing that hun-
dreds of thousands more be
wounded and maimed for life. (3)
We can intervene if we wish
thousands of civilians to die of
disease and starvation behind the
lines. (4) We can intervene, if
we are willing to see billions of
dollars in munitions blown into
atoms, (5) We can intervene if
we want to see billions more in
private property blasted into slivr
era.

(6) We can intervene if we
are prepared to race wholesale
inﬂation. (7) We can intervene
it we are willing to accept a
dictntorahip or the War depart
merit. (a) We can intervene if
we want millions of unem-
pluyed in a post—war depres-
sion. (9) We can intervene if
we are prepared to mpt the
possibility 01 permanent break-
down in our democratic sys—
tem. (10) We can intervene if
we want billions of dollars in
war—borrowings added to our
already unpayablc national debt.

You don't agree? You say that
you don’t intend to go to war,
that your intervention lies in
measures "short of war” and in
speaking “In cairn and reasoned
voice?" But witness our experi~
encc of the World War; we were
going to give only economic as-
sistance then, but you know what
happened. No, you show us an
America that can give assistance
“short of war” and speak "with
calm and reasoned voice" with the
rest of the world at war, and
we'll show you an America of
gods,

Compare the points, and take
your choice, Mr. intervention—
ist, It you believe that $250,—
000,000 is worth the blood of
the nation's young men or that
50 per cent or the tobacco crop
is worth a 15 billion dollarwar
expenditure, then shouideryour
rifle and “save the world, etc.”
again; it’s your the. But don’t
count on us; we preier to let
the tobacco and the $250,000,—

000 save themselves.
