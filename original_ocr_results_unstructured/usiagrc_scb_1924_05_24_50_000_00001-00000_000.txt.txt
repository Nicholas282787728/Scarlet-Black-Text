to he presented on the evening of Set
urday, June 7, by the senior class, is
ranked by Burns Mantle as one of the
ten best plays of the season 1921.22,
Due to the excellence of the play the
class thought it Wiser to repeat "Enc
ter Madame" than to select another
one. it is a comedy of the highest
calibre and has many serious aspects,
as well as novel and mirth—provoking
situations.

Many requests to give a second per»
formance of the comedy were received
from alumni in Grinnell, who declar-
ed it to be one of the best plays ever
presented here. It will he the first
time in the history of Grinnell dra-
matics that such a thing has been
done, and the venture deserves the
support of the student body, as well as
the faculty and alumni. Whether you
saw the first performance or not
should make no‘ difference in your en-
joyment of the second, as many new
angles have been added to the inter-
,pretiltion of the play and the cast will
have six new members.

he may get a third or fourth out of

In the 440 there are a number of

will save them for the mile relay.
Should any orinuell men run, they will

There are no Pioneer entries in the

a strong possibility that he may win

illWES PLAN PHAISEI]
IN EXBWLEMUHE

Professor Wilson Characterizes
Report ‘As An Unbiased
Business Proposal.

“The Dawes plan is the first con-
structive measure toward the
ning of peace," declared Prof. George
Grafton Wilson, liar-yard Exchange
lecturer, at chapel Thursday morning.

“General Dawes has made it per—
fectly clear- that we must reconstruct
on a basis of justice and understand—
ing. In Dawcs' own words, ‘Common
sense must be crowned king The av—
erage person does not realize the hur—
rier-s that must be beaten down he‘-
fore peace is realized. The Allies uni-
ted to win the war but they have
iailcd to unite to win pcucc.

""he treaty was made in a spirit of
revenge and retaliation as has been
the custom in bygone days. Such a
contract is an unsatisfactory arrange—
ment. The investigation of the com-
mittee of experts, of which General
Dawes was the head, has made it per—
fectly apparent that in a modern War
the vanquished can't pay the price of
the war."

Mr. Wilson proved the utter impos—
sihility oi forcing Ger-marry to assume
the burden of the whole war by point—
ing out how enor-onrous were the ei»
penditur-cs of the United States alone.
"The American war expenditures
amounted to 22 billion dollars, the
equivalent of all the gold mined in
the world since 1492. The other Ale
lies had larger debts than the United
states. Consider, then, the demand
of the treaty that the Germans pay
reparations in gold! Why, to per cent
of all the world’s gold is under lock
and key in the United states treasury.
kept there by tariff laws which pro-
hihit the exportation of gold. This ex-
ample shows what can be put into a
treaty. What can he got out of a
treaty?" .

"Dawes declared at the beginning of
his research that the economic unity
of Germany was necessary for the re-
construction or Europe. That is_il|st
what the conquerors were striving to
prevent. Howey-er, Dawes went ahead
with his investigation on the theory
that in order to get anything out of
Germany, something would have to he
put in. His plan for accomplishing
this is a. new German state bank.
which shall have a capital equivalent
to two million dollars in American
money. The easiest way for Germany
to get this' money is through a loan
by the Allies."

Mr. Dawes’ plan is to issue bonds
on the railroads and certain basic in—
dustries of Germany, The German
railroads have rebuilt to a remarkable
degree since Germany was forced to
turn her railway equipment over to
the Allies at the close of the war. Ger—
many-s railroads are her most valua-
hle, tangible possession. it is Mr.
Wilson's belief that issuing bonds on
industries would not he so
satisfactor , since few of these
industries are government owned, and
are not so stable as the railroads.

Mr. Wilson characterized the Dawcs‘
report as a business proposition, un-
inlluenced by politics or sentiment.
