GRINNELL MEETS
CORNELL TODAY
(Continued lrom hge One)

Kepler battle for inching honors to~

day. Kepler was the man who made

Cornell touchdowns po sihle against

Coe, since it was his punts that Pense

rumhled and Lawrence rccovercd,

scoring a touchdown both times.
Parker Out oi Lineup

Griniiell will be handicapped by the
absence or Captain Parker in today's
lineup but either hearing or \Vllitelllll
is slated to work at right hall and
both or them are capable oi iiiling the
position above any criticism. Datcse
man has been cripplcrl on account at
an infected icg hut will play today
against Cornell. The possibility oi
his being on the side lines caused a
great deal of anxiety to the Gi'innell
mentor.

Six of the regulars are playing their
last game of college football, namcly
Winter, Dimit, Hicks, Knies, Macy
and \Vassenaar. The same is true cl
Turner, Vlnsel and Richards, all at
whom may get a chalice, and the
Pioneers are 'pectcd to to at the
height or their righting ability.

Cornell will play hard [ootball and
will do their best to win but the Mt
Vernon institution has a reputation
for clean athletics and Crinueli will
receive the host or treatment regard-
less or dcicat or vicic ,

From all indications onuucll will
not have an easy time with the Methr
odists but the student hotly has abso-
lute confidence in the ahility oi Coach
Saunders and the team, and firmly
believes that Grinliell will be ahlc to
detect Cornell this afternoon.
