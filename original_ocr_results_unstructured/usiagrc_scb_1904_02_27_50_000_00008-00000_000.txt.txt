The church was prettily adorned
with iestoons, principally oi scarlet
and Llack with here and there some
visiting college's banner to identify
the lusty group oi checrers who
had gathered around it. Simpson and
Wesleyan held the south galleiy: the
008 forces sat facing them on the
north; Grinnell had managed to scat

his deﬁant song nor iithc loyal gn-

from Simpson grew hoarse as the
night wore on, College yelling is an
art which can ignore details oi such
sordid nature and be the more artist

for h‘aving done so. It is sale to say
that every college representcd there
felt more deeply the spirit of fraternal
iellowship than ever herore. The one
disappointment of the evening was
the non appearance on the pro.
gramme at Winworth Williams,
Drake's strongspoaker. Sickness which
he had hoped to overpower, had at

the last hour compelled him to With-

natured and humorous criticism of her
subject began her ten minute response.
The State College resents the insinua-
liion implied in the subjectztsslgned it,
“Our Shooting Gallery.” Amos, we
are to understand is not training
school teachers nor are the ideas theV
have up therein any respect “young.”
In a Strain more serious she argued
againstultra cautiousness and its up-
poslte. Better methods must not be
put aside by a ialse spirit of conserva-
tism, but the shortening oi the college
course should never be Considered
progress.

On account of the absence of the
speaker irom Western College the
riddresspn Iowa at Washington went
by deiault.

Lilian Cunningham, for Central
University was next m be introduced.
The subject “Oratory in Life" was
outlined and analyzed in a compre-
llcnsive way. Oratory in some phase
pervades over-y condition of human
life. Its range is the Whole of man's

activity, and agicat need or the world
in general is more art in oratory and
more oratory itself. True oratory rips
pools to both heart and head.

“Our Wise boy, the victor” was ably
portrayed by Mr. Poppeuheimor of
Morningside. The wise boy would go
lortli i'roin tiie,1owa contest the repre-
sentative of the whole state. He will

American,

Owing to the illness on Mr. Will
Wood or Pena, the wast-masterin-
troduoed as the Quaker College sub-
stitute, Miss Bertha Lawrence, who
had been inrormed of her duty only on
the day or the banquet, but responded
in a most artistic and charming man-
ner. Humor and logic were mingled
in her remarks to a. happy degree.

No doubt the most Linished produc-
tion oi the evening was the response
by Miss Wescott of Lenox, to the
toast: ”Future Possibilities.” Miss
Weseott’s ellort was the lost of the
evcniug and as was hitting her‘ remarks
partooklittle oi the humorous. The
present is but the culmination of all
the pasts the world has ever Seen, the
l'uture will ho tiic resultant of all the
presents that shall ever come mus.
it behooves us, then to see that our
inturcs are not built upon the sands,
hows the realm of Athens, a state
which fell for wantolastable religion.
Faith in the true God will load us
safe and united, a great nation to the
dawn ol the New Jerusalem.
