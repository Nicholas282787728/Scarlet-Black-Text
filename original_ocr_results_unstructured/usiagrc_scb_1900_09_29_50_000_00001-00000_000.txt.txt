PRESIDENT SANDERS.

Tuesday morning, the board of
trustees elected a successor to
President Gates, whose resigna-
tion takes effect Nov. Ist. The
lot has fallen to Dr. Frank Knight
Sanders, who is now Professor of
Biblical Literature in Yale Uni-
versity.

Dr. Sanders springs trorn New
England parents. His father and
mother were appointed missions
aries by the American Board and
labored in Ceylon for several
years, He was born there in the
year 1861. Three years later the
father died and the family returns
ed to Connecticut. He remained
with his mother until he was
ﬁfteen years of age. At that
time he went to Ripon, Wiscon-
sin, where he continued his stud-
ies preparatory to entering col»
lege. At the end ot six years he
graduated from Ripon College in
the class of 1882.

Soon atter his graduation he
went back to Ceylon, under a four
years contract, toteach in the colr
logo which his father had found»
ed. After his return from India
he went to Yalc University, where
hc studied in the Theological
Seminary and the post-graduate
department. He completed two

 

years' work in the Semlnary, audl
received the degree at Doctor of
Philosophy in 1889. Soon after
this he succeeded Professor Hare
per to the Chair of Biblical Liters
atui'c, which position he has held
till the present time.

Dr. Sanders is in the prime of
life, and seems well ﬁtted for the
place to which he has been
chosen.

The trustees have extended this
call only after careful investigate
tion. and hour ull appearances
they have chosen wisely. Cerr
tainly this is true if testimonials
are of any value. Dr. Harper,
President ot Chicago University,
is particularly strong in his con-
gratulations to a member of the
board of trustees.

Although not absolutely Sure,
the trustees are quite certain that
Dr. Sanders will accept the call.
If such is the case. he will, in all
probability. be inaugurated next

out the contrast between the Bar
hemian life of a large university
and the close fellowship of a small
college.

Miss Hinltley spoke on Rock—
ford Seminary. Her stories of
night spreads held arter hours,
and the terribly good care taken
of one day and night, bringing out
the humorous side, were well
worth hearing.

Miss Stoerlein told of dotmitory
life at Mt. Holyoke; and still an-
other view, the religious.

Smith College was treated of by
