Drake Tops In Everything
Mainstay Of Track Team

by Dave Cochran

George Drake makes a habit
of being tops, whether it be
athletically or academically.
Expected to be the school's
mainstay in track and cross-
country for two more years,
George gave the track squad a
scare when he returned from
spring vacation with a strained
tendon in his leg, which he in-
curred while working out. For-
tunately the injury does not ap-
pear to be too serious, and
George figures he’ll be running
again in a few days.

Predicts Fourth

This is cheering news,
cause he’ll have to be in top
shape it the team is to make
a good showing in the forth.
‘coming meets. When asked about
the teams chances, George re-
plied, “Things have been look-
ing up because some key men
just recently became eligible,
but the team was hurt a lot by
the draft last summer.” He fig-
ures Grinnell for about fourth
in the conference.

George's main ambition now
is to run a 4:15 to 4:20 mile.
Considering the fact that he was
timed unofficially in about 4:25
just before vacation over the
small indoor track in the woe
men’s gym, the attainment of
this goal seems quite possible.
when asked what he thought
about the four minute mile,
George said, “I don’t see how
Wes Santee (Kansas) can miss.”

Scholarship Student

George, who graduated from
LaGrange high school in mi-
nois, chose Grinneu hecause he
wanted a small school and had
always heard that Grinnell was
one of the best, “of course," he
says, “the Baker scholarship
helped a little, too." Since his
advent on campus George has
been a member of

staff, Board of Religion, and has
been a class officer hoth years,
this year as president of the
sophomore class.
