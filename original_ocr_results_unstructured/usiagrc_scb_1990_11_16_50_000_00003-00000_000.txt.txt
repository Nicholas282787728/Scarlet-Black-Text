Eastern Europe Facing Problems of Change

Symposium Speaker Focuses on Czechoslovak ‘Velvet Revolution"

By Daniel Bliss

The Rosenfield Program's
Symposium on Eastern Europe
opened Tuesday with Otto Ulc,
professor of political science at the
State University of New York,
Binghamton.

Ulc noted that Czechoslovakia
was the only country in Eastern
Europe in which Communists had
won power through the 1946 free
elections, Two years later, when
they appeared to be in danger of
losing their majority, they staged a
coup installing Klement Gottwald
as the country‘s premier.

He also spoke of the staggering
decline in Czechoslovakia’s for-
tunes over the past 50 years, begin
ning with theNazidismembcrment
of the country and continuing with
Communist rule. Whereas prerwar
Czechoslovakia was an industrial
powerhouse, one of the world’s 10
largest producers of manufactured
goods, it is now barely in thetop 50.

Ulc lauded the pcacful na-
ture of the Czechoslovakian
“velvet revolution" of last
year, but he doubted that the
country wouldlooktothefrcc
market and freewheeling
economies ofNorth America
as an economic model, citing
Sweden instead as an example
that the Czech people looked
up to. But economics were
not his only concern.

“With the common um-
breliaoropprcssipnintranet
tionalism is rcemerging,” he
said. He mentioned that
opinion polling suggests that
more than 40 percent of
Czechs regard relations with
Slovaks, the largest ethnic
minority in Czechoslovakia,
as “violent".

For their part, the Slovaks have
been showing increasing support
for separation from the rest of
Czechoslovakia, which was forced
to adopta federal constitution even

under Communist rttle after the
upristng of 1968, the "Prague
Spring".

Fragmentation of political plirr
tics is also a major problem, Ulc

said. No less than 23 political
partiesand coaJiLionslook part
in the recent election.

But in spite of the political
fragmentation in the country
and the enormous economic
resources of the Communist
Party, Vaclav Havcl's Civic
Forum was swept to power
with more than 50 percent of
the vote in a campaign focus-
ing heavily on personaliucs,
Ulc said. Civic Forum has
many members of the Chtutcr
77 dissident organization
among its leadership.

Ulc added that the subscr
quent adoption by the
Czechoslovak Parliament of

out fringe panics. This Will not,

vote

Ulc saw the Communists as be
ing a major problem in
Czechoslovakia’s ﬂedgling dc»
itiocracy. The Civic Forum gov-
cmmcnl was, he said, made up of
amateurs, while the Communists,
dcspitc losing half their member-
ship. still had enormous cash ren
serves and fixed assets such as
property.

Furthermore, he claimed, they
have portrayed actions initiated by
the new government such as the
blanket amnesty and tile Civic
Forum’s policy ul'reconciliaiion as
signs of weakness. hoping that a
worried electorate might turn to
them during the hitrtiships alicrid.

Student Observes Trauma of Captive Apes
Zoo Apes Pyschologically Stressed in Squalid Conditions of a Tourist Attraction

By Karin Bellomy

Grinnell sophomore Adina Sales
spent last summer with apes.

Sales studied hierarchy and ag-
gressivc behavior in captive man-
drills, an ape closely related to the
baboon, for six Weeks last summer
through a program at Colorado
College in Colorado Springs.

"lite course was offered in asso
ciation with ihciano Goodall Insti-
tute as part of the chimpanzee pro-
gram,aprogram whichthcinstitutc
has established in various zoos.
Sales says that the Colorado Springs
program began as part ofthe Chey-
cnnc Mountain Zoo, and the col-
loge became involved later.

For the first two days of class,
students acquired a limited back
ground on non-human primate be-
havior and learned various tech»
niques for recording primate be-
havior.

One such technique, called
“timed follows," involved follow-
ing the actions of one individual
primateand recording those actions
every minute on the minute, or ev-
ery thirty seconds, for a certain du-
ration of time, such as an hour or
fifteen minutes.

Using a code compiled by Jane
Goodall, a British scientist known
for her longetcrin study ofa group
of chimpanzees in Tanzania, the
students would record the kind of
behavior, the situation in which the
behavior occurred, and, if another
individual was involved, the prox-
imity of that individual.

Since the syllabus the students
used was designed by Goodall for
chimpanzees,thestudents practiced
their recording techniques on
chimps, butthey were not conﬁned

was not allowed any direct contact with the apes.

to using chimps for their individual
research projects.

Sales chose to study mandrills.
From the basic information she had
acquired about mandrills from
background research, Sales deter
mined that the effects of captivity
caused them to more rigidly deﬁne
their hierarchy and dominance
ranking titan theywould in thewildt

"They were constantly defining
their position in the ranking be-
cause they had to, They were so
spatially conﬁned that itdcmanded
that they constantly assert them-
selves.” said Sales. Six mandrills,
the largest ofwhich was the size of
a Labrador retriever, lived in a zoo
cage fourmeters wide.threemelcrs
deep and three meters high, a far
cry from thelivingspacetheywould
have in the wild.

The zoo has not been renovated
since the l950’s,andalthoughSales

believes that zoos in general have
positive aspects—they educate
pooplc about animals they might
not normallyinteraciwith,and they
are a means of preserving endan-
gcrcd Spocicsishc is unhappy with
the conditions in which the man-
drills live in Colorada Springs.

“It's essential that the public be
educated in a proper way, that if
animals must be held in captivity,
then [thezoosl shouldtry and simu-
late the most natural environment
possible," she added,

Mandrills in thewild spend most
of their waking hours foraging for
food, but the zoo does not provide
them with enough stimuli to ocn
cupy theirwakinghoursinthecagc.
As a result, Sales observed quite a
bit of aberrent behavior resulting
from boredom, such as corpography
(eating excrement), chipping paint
off the bars and eating it, excessive

self- grooming and even hair-
plucking

Mandrills normally live in large
Lroops of up to 100-200 individu-
als, which split off into groups of
20-30 during the day to search for
food; these captive ones have been
forced into an unnatural family
grouping of one male and five fe-
males. This social deprivation also
contributes to aberrant behavior.

“The general mechanisms of ti
hierarchy exist, but the effects of
captivity are so tremcndous thtii
every action is exaggerated. You

putting hay in the maiidrills’ edge,
which had a positive effect; it pro»
sentcd them a greater challenge in
finding food. But this action has
not solved many of the problems.

well with the public. However,
attempts to integrate him into a
group of chimps were unsuccess~
ful,and he spends much ofhis time
just rocking back and forth. Al-
though he was old enough to have
scxual desires by that time, there
was basically no interaction be

“i saw zoos in a much different
