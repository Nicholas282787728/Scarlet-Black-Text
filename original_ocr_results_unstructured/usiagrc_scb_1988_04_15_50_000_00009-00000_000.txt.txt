Patrick
MC Grath’s
Blood and Water
and Other Tales

by vincent prosser

what is Patrick McGraih's
work? Camp? Droll? Wicked?
Ludicrous” insane? Delicious?
Yes. it IS all these things. Like the
girl at the beginning oi his tale,
“The Lost Explorer." we can only
be devastatingly taken with his
Poe-cumrFlrbank world:

“One fresh and gusty day in the
damp autumn ot her twelith year
Evelyn found a lost explorer in the
garden oi her parents' London
home. He was lying in a small tent
beneath a mosquito net so torn and
gaping as to be quite inadequate,
were there any mosquitoes ior it to
protect him irom. His clothes were
stained with sweat and blood. and
a grizzled beard stubbled his
emaciated face. 0n the iolding
stool beside the camp bed stood a
ilask. empty, a revolver. unloaded,
two bullets. three matche -a‘small

oil lamp, and a dirty, creased map‘

or the upper reaches or the Congo,
He was delirious with fever and 0C-
casionally gibbered about the
pygmies. Evelyn thought he was
wonderful."

McGrath's first book. “Blood
and Water and Other Tales”
(Poseidon Press, an imprint oi
Simon and Schusteri. is available
and worth reading 7 when you're
in the right mood. No other con-
temporary writer can write so wit-
tily on themes such as corpses
drained of blood. disembowelment,
pickled thumbs. butchered car-
casses. and other fun liction topics.
Cannibalism and dismembernfent
are recurrent themes. While I like
decadence as much as anyone,
cannibalism and dismemberment
do begin to pan. They really do,

one sweeps back with one move of

forehead in a few limp strands.

Like other storytellers of the old
school such as Isak Dinesen.
McGraih becomes a high authorial
figure. He controls the world of his
[ales because he is its sole creator.

In his right hand. McGrath held
his book, a lily ior his contempla-

story-'5 each idelicate nuance: ofw

suggestionﬂoue, and feeling. His
soothing. entrancing voice seduced
us all.

Once he finished the reading.
McGrath entertained our ques
tions. He was deeply pleased by the
audience's reaction to his quirky
tale — he seemed used to being
treated with dread and wonder.
When asked about his background.
his childhood. his eyebrows lifted
in an expression oi deep surprise,
“011. 1 had a perfectly normal

normal. Quite normal. Yes. quite
perfectly normal.” But his smile
and twinkling eye and laconic
manner suggested that no
background could have been
stranger or more iull oi decadent
pleasures and sinfulnesses. Cerr
tainly. his wholesome middleclass
background is surprising. given
the delightiully peremptory pukka-
sahib-ish tone oi so many of his
narrations. You should hear his
voice. enrapturing us as it intones.

book. But don‘t live it. They’d ar-

Women in Love

by Bruce Emond

British director Ken Russell is
not noted for his restraint His
films, including “The Music
Lovers," ”Lisztomania." “Altered
States.” and. recently. ”Crimes of
Passion." with Kathleen Turner.
are crammed with unusual themes
and bizarre symbolism. His
“Women in Love," a 1970 adapta~
tion of D.H. Lawrence's novel, is a
strange and compelling iilm.
replete with brilliant acting. ex-
cellent dialogue tthe script is by
Larry Kramer. the playwright of
“The Normal Heart”l. and sensual
Cinematography.

Even without these qualities. the
cast list is impressive enough to
merit one's attention It includes
Alan Bates. Glenda Jackson,
Oliver Reed (both Jackson and
Reed are regulars in Russell prov
ductions), and the beautiful but
littlerknown Eleanor Bron (her on
ly other tilm which comes to mind
is “Bedazzled,” with Dudley
Moore). Then, of course. there is
the oftrmentioned wrestling scene
between Reed and Bates where
both actors. completely naked.
wrestle in the soft glow oi a
fireside. “Women in
Love,” is a film that will intrigue
and confuse you. and probably
make you want to see more oi
Russell's work.

The Cotton Club

by Brian strause

For a film geared so highly to
suriace glitz, it is surprising that
“The Cotton Club" is so boring.
Director Francis Coppola attempts
to dazzle us with framing inspired
by the MTV school of filming. Fast.
high-speed energy 7 it works
great in three-minute intervals.
but when taken in a dose of two
hours. I left this film feeling stuff-
ed and sick. similar to the nausea
that follows the eating oi a can of
icing.

”The Cotton Club" is Coppola's
attempt to take everything he saw
in his favorite gangster films of
yesteryear and squeeze it for all
it's worth. Basically, it comes
down to this: Coppola is a pimp
and Richard Gere is his prostitute,
The only reason Gere is in this film
is because his looks (certainly not
his acting) inspire young girls to
flock in droves to the theatre with
their boyfriends in tow. Gere

whites did not play music at the

historical movie at least stick to
the facts, Black musiCIans led by
the great Duke Ellington and then
later by Cab Calloway would play
to the allrwhite crowd. Get it? The
Cotton Club. a place where the
“primitive" appeal oi black
singers and dancers was exploited
by the white promoters and
organizers,

This iilm only presents us with a
two-dimensional look at the scene
of the Cotton Club. The characters
are all based on stereotypes. The
only revolutionary step this iilm
makes is its effort to showcase the
roles of the black entertainers,
Earlier gangster films never
would have been so daring, but
nonetheless in the 805 these ad-
vancements should be expected,

“The Cotton Club" is like the
bullets in its actor’s guns. It makes
a lot of noise. It stirs up a lot of
dust. But most of all it's blank.

Windwalker

by Steve Hingtgen

“Windwalker” is a western and
a love story, two very common
themes for a popular movie. But
this is not a common movie.
Besides its visual beauty. the iirst
thing you will notice about “\‘t‘indr
walker" is that it is in native
American languages with English
narration, The second thing you
will probably notice is that there
are no cowboys in this western. it
is a story about the lite oi a
Cheyenne medicine man and his
iamily. not about indians without
personalities getting mauled by
heroic pioneers.

For once we have the opportunir
ty to see a movie which relates a

bit of American Indian culture in
an exciting and innovative way
without the usual Hollywoodrsized
serving of romantic stereotypes
about savages and primitives. Ad-
mittedly. “Windwalker” isn’t
periect, and at times in its attempt
to tell the remarkable story of the
family’s adventures it even
becomes a bit too charming, but in
the end it is refreshing to be
presented with the humanity oi a
culture we understand little about
rather than simply using the peo-
ple as props in a battle scene,

The one distracting aspect oi
“Windwalker” is that. while it is a
sincere and careiully made lilm
about the life of a respected Indian
medicine man. the lead role is
played by Trevor Howard who is
not. himseli. native American, The
movie does deserve credit,
however. in that every other per-
son in the cast of 50 is native
American, 3 minor detail with
which most movies don't bother.

See “Windwalker” because it's a
good {link with great scenery. exr

love scenes. but on the way home,
appreciate the film's unique
