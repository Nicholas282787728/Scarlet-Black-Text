Centaurs, Cillian and ‘the system’-

Red Eye (PG 3

There's a certain amount ofmnsochism involvcd in
watching it thriller. lfthe bad guy is appealing enough,
we don't mind fantasizing about being put through
hell by him. Rm! Eye revels in this concept.

Cillian Murphy, playing the aptly named Jack
Ripner, seowls and smirks in the close quarters of a
jet plane and terrorizes Lisa Reiscrt, played by Rachel
McAdams. Jack threatens her personal and profeSs
sional life as she is held captive in her Window seat, all
during earlysmorning turbulence.

The film begins with Lisa and jack doing a bit of
awkward fellow-passenger ﬂirting in the ticket line
and over airport bar drinks.Then we get to the good
stuff. Once safely seatrbclted on the plane, he tells her
she has to choose between facilitating‘the assassina-
tion of a prominent hotel guest or letting her father
die, and she has to use the AirPhone to make the calls
to get one or the other done. Then, there’s nothing
she can do but wait.

In a lot of ways, those events could stop the film
dead in its tracks, but the characters are so wellrconr
ceived and play so well against each other that they
are rotally believable (and entirely uncomfortable).
The tense atmosphere of the jet, with a healthy smat-
tering of plane stereotypes—the stuffy yuppies, the
chatty grandma, the little girl ﬂying alone, the obnox—
ious high schoolersiadd to their believability. It all
adds up and makes viewers (and Lisa) squirm.

By way of its enchanting villain; its smart, goods
hearted heroine; the uncomfortable atmosphere of
air travel and the very real dilemma at hand, RedEye
somehow endears itself. It fails a little ﬂat on motives
for killing the hotel guest, which could have ﬂeshed
out the plor, but when we ger to spend so long look
ing at Murphy’s steely blue eyes and impeccable bone
structure in closeup, who needs motives anyway?

Chronicles rni‘a (PG)

After being converted to Christianity by his good
friend, J.R.R. Tolkien, CS Lewis wrote a delightful
lirrle allegory about four children who accidentally
travel to a magical realm where cute, fuzzy animals
ﬁght nasty, fuzzy animals. This ﬁlm, in the spirit or
capitalizing on all those childhood memories, faiths
fully takes thar story to the screen, As a result, 7715
Circuit/er a/Nrmiia is a successful, albeit technically
and artistically mediocre, adaptation ofa classic child
hood story.

Many have complained abour the film’s allegorical
content, but the translation of biblical content is so
transparent that it becomes quite harmless. Further-
more, its interpretation of jesus’ death and resurrecr
tion piesented is quite wateredsdownfhe chauvinist

attitudes played out in the relationships between the
four children bothered me more.

On a technical level, the ﬁlm is much less defens
sible. In many ways, warehing the ﬁlm felt like watch-
ing a lowersbudget and less innovative version or
Peter Jackson’s Tl): Lord aft!” Ringx, where Gollum
has been replaced with talking beavers.The cinemas
rography is uninspired, and when combined with very
impatient editing, it fails to leave any lasting images.
I was particularly disappointed with the failure to
properly exploit the image ofthc solitary forest lamps
post at which the children arrive in Narnia.

Fortunately, the magical quality of the original
story, and the success of these writers in adapting it,
shines through the ﬁlm’s technical ﬂaws,'l"hc actors,
while failing to give any memorable performances,
did succeed in making the story believable. Even the
little snot-nosed children, so often the bane of these
ﬁlms, performed adequately, As a result, the film is
an enjoyable adaptation oftl-le novel, though I wish it
had more energy and imagination.

art, leaving only a note signed “the Edukators."

When Peter’s girlfriend Jule is evicted from her
apartment and moves in with the boys, the movie he-
gins to pick up steam. A victim of “the system,"]ule
acquired massive debt by totaling a yuppie's Mercedes
with her VW, and this makes her attractive to Jan,
who is more of an ideologue than his partner.

When Peter leaves one weekend, Jan and Jule fall
into each other's arms.]an reveals to Jule that he and
Peter are indeed the Edukators, and she persuades
him to break into the house ofthe man to whom she
owes money “just to take a look around."

Throwing his usual caution into the wind, Jan
agrees, and the ensuing situation 'leads our heroes to
ask many questions: Are their methodologies sound?
Have they just become common criminals? Is there
hope for the downtrodden against the machine of
capitalist greed.> And just who the hell is sleeping
together?

The loxvsbudget film is shot digitally, using all
natural lighting. compared to a Hollywood film,
the picture can get a lime rough around the edges,
This adds to the look of the film and makes it feel
more gritty and realistic. Some might be turned off
by the lack of overall picture quality, especially on the
big scleen. Also, the jeﬂ‘ Buckley song “Hallelujah” is
entirely overused. (This song was also used in sire/e
Enough said.)

Overall, I found this film to be a stunning work
of independent cinema, and much more enthralling
than many movies with larger budgers. Weingarrner
has truly made a ﬁlm with his heart, and it is easily the
best German film since Ruiz Lola Rim.
