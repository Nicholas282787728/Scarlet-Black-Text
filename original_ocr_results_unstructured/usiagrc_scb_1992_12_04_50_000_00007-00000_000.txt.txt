Sabin, Senior, to speak to
Congressional Committee

by Kendra Ford

Membersofl-‘earlessareexcited.
Their message is being heard. One of
their members, Portia Sabin, senior,
has been invited toWashington D. C.
to testify before the House Judiciary
Committee Subcommittee on Crime
to testify on Tuesday, Dec. 8. Sabin
has been asked to share the expertise
she has acquired working with Grin-
nell College activist organization
Fearless.

According to Sabin, Charles
Schutner. the chair ofthe committee.
and a Democrat from New York, has
recently taken an interest in highway
crime. He is looking for information
that Fearless has acquired: statistics
on highway crime (especially gender
based crime), how to educate people.
and an understanding of the search
for the perpetrators of highway felo-
ntes.

Schumer found Sabin through
Sally Goldfarb of the NOW Legal
Defense Fund. Sabin and Goldfarb
have been communicating aboutsta-
tistics on gender based crimes and
women’s safety issues. When
Schumer contacted Goldfarb for in-
formation on highway crimes she re
ferred him to Sabin.

Sabin is asked to testify in an
oversight hearing. a hearing to deter-
mine the need for legislation on an
issue.

Sabin sztid that she will give a
five minute opening statement, in
which she will describe the Tammy

Zywicki tragedy, the formation and
workings of Fearless and the legisla—
tion on whichFearless has been work-
ing. She will also work with an aid to
Schumer to compose a series ofques-
ticns for him to ask of her in order to.
”bring out the best testimony."

Fearless has been working on a
Congressional bill which would re-
quire telephone callboxes on every
mile of federally funded highway.
This invitation to D. C. is a big boost
to their cause.

Sabin will be able to take quite a
bit of information with her to Wash
ington.Studentsin Public Policy class
at Luther College have been doing
research for the bill, and they will
meet with Sabin on Sunday to share
their information with her.

Explaining her reaction to the
opportunity to speak to the commit-
tee. Sabin exclaimed,“1‘m really ex~
cited about this because it’s the op-
portunity Fearless has needed to bring
our cause to national attention and
especially with regard to legislation
we’re attempting to pass...“

Amy Evans added, “People are
listening to us. It's an incredible,
empowering feeling.“ Holly Mahling.
senior, said with wonder, “We‘ve
started a grass roots organization.“

Sabin will fly to Washington on
Tuesday and return Wednesday. It’s
a whirlwind tour, but she hopes to do
some good networking And she will
have a chance to hand out packets of
information about Fearless, created
in Grinnell, to several Congressmen.
