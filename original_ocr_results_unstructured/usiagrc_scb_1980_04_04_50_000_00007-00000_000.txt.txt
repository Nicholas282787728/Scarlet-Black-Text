Coach Pﬁtsch aptly summed up the
baseball team's trip to Ranger, Tex..
when he said to me after a defeat,
”Christ, Joe. it's hell out there! ”
There was a wild gleam in his eyes as
he spoke; I believe that the baseball
game evoked many oi his most poig-
nant memories of World War ll.

Actually, we didn't play that poorly.
It was Ranger Jr. College that played
brilliantly, as usual. Considering that
we were playing our first games oi the
year, and Ranger had already played
over 75 games, there was much to be
optimistic about.

The most notable performances ol‘
our trip: the tenacious hitting of Scot:
ty Adams mm and Dave Dunning
(313), brilliant deicnsive gems by Jot:
Nixon (CF) and Gibby Gilbert (C), the
craity pitching oi Kevin “Dough"
Starrett and Chris “Smedcley” Eric],
and the unbelievably Confounding
signal calling 0! Coach Ptitsch. Willi
more consistent pitching and tighter
detense to go along with a good hitting
attack, the Pioneers could pull on
some surprises this year.

Ill addition to having the chalice to
play against a talented team, the trips
to Ranger have provided an opportuni-
ty to observe an interesting and Hills
que school, The people at Ranger are
judged by their athletic ability and
how well their team pcriorms, quite
unlike the classless Socicly here at
Grinnell in which people are dil‘l'urcli»
tiatcd by their participation in \‘arlous
“Activity" groups. naiigcr attracts
many talented athletes ironi under-
priviledged and minority iamilics,
many of whom believe that athletics is
their road to success. The cumpcllllilll
ior varsity positions is liercc and
there is always pressure on the
athletes to pcriorm well.

What puzzled me during the
previous trips to Ranger was the
modest manner in which the, arsity
athletes dealt with (hair ac»
complishmellts. Many of the baseball
players had batting averages well
above .400 and were knocking out

home runs at recordssetling paces.
Not oncc did I hear a varsity athlete

boast about hoiv well he was playing. 1
think i learned part or the answer
when I had lunch with the Ranger var-
sity rightlicldor. llc lavored his right
leg when he walked. so l asked him
why. he said, “I turned my ankle a
couple oi months ago and it still gives
me problems."

“Well, why don’t you sit out A few
games and lel it get better," i replied.

”I can't do that, someone might
take my place.”

“But how’s that possible when you
are hitting over .400?” I asked.

“There are a lot or good players
here, and besides, the scouts come to
watch us every day. l have to play.”

From his point of View he couldn't
afford to sit back and relish his ac-
complishments. Making Ranger's val"
sity baseball team was just the begin
niilg. Ranger‘s uSSlSt'dl'lt coach, Don

On the way back to Gl'inncll I said
to Coach Plltsch, "Well, that’s 5 years
down there without winning a game."

”That’s right, .luu, it's hell down

he said.
