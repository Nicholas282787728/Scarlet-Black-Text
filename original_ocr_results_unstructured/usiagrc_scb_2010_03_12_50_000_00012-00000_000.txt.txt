> SQUUUUUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDDD.

Okay, people, There is a grand old Grinnell
tradition that we need to revive, one essential tor
maintaining earnpus unity between 10/10 and

block party. 1 speak, otcourse, oquuid. The rules -

of Squid are simple: sorneon'e throws a banana
‘peel at another tahle in the dining hall and ev-
eryone at the thrower’s table yells “SQUIIIIIIID!”
Then someone at the targeted table is obligated to
kill the squid by stabbing it to death with it fork.

I havent seen a single person play Squid this year, .

and it’s breaking my heart. C'inonl Bananas are

_ chock—full of potassium and squishy goodness!
You can meet cute people at other tables! Do the
right thing! Kill the squid!

Dinner is over, excuse yourselves Better to have poop than a pauper

To the anonymous group of ﬁrst years who
comes late to every meal. and sits upstairs in the
dining hall.

During every meal we work on, we always see
you guys. Your group seems to always be the one
that stays the latest at meals and winds up'getting
in the way or us wiping down tables. Your group
also seems to have to be told to bus your trays ev-
ery meal, 50 please do us a favor: when you see
that one ofus has wiped down each table upstairs
except for yours, take it as your cue to leave the
dining hall. You may continue your conversations
elsewhere. We need to have all of the tables clean
find your group is consistently getting in the way
We have many other things that need to be dam
on our respective shifts and we really cannot and
should not have to wan up for you,

F-word you, Word. Spellcheck that.

I’m getting ptettyfed up with Microsoﬁ‘Word' ~

trying to tell me that words, which are words, us
not in tact words, Fuck it, even plans spelleeheck
knows that ‘nspirational’ is a word. Also Word
needs to stop trying to automatically standardize
my grummur/‘misspellings' and strip me of: all my
individual creativity. Language changes, and put-—
poseﬁllly r‘e ting its rules can enhance an indi-
viduals abil to express‘himsettrio the purpose
of language).DeaI Microsoft, you're appealing

to the lowest common denominator of language ~

snobs in order to make the biggest profit and in so
creating a society of mindless followers who stop
developing their vocabulary at the eighth grade
level and complain about anyone who doesn’t t’ole
low suit.

There are two kinds party poopers: the lit-
eral party pooper and the tattlertale. A recent
lounge party featured a tub of juice, and once
it was empty, partiers abandoned it for another
party, The next morning, during clean up, it was
discovered that someone had defecatcd into the
tub. Such an action resulted in a win-Win. sitti-
ation. The mysterious detlcerv-who presumably
had beef with the party or pattyrthrowersicfr
rocrively expressed his opinion, and the party
throwers apprcciatcd a brilliantly siinplo prank.
This is much preferred to the tattle-tale who, for
example, reported -.t keg (post-parry, mind you)
with no lounge contract or rhe tattle-tale who
called security on a loud party wuhout confront
ing rho patterhr-owors ﬂrot,Y0u can deuce in the
juicc, but please don't dent-c ou sel ‘ governance

EE THE PAPER

Heading into town to do some shopping? Rath-
er than taking the car, break out the tennis shoes and
walk or hike into town. Give the new hike path out
to WﬂhMan a tryiitls almost snow free.l Not only
will you get some iresh air, but you'll also reduce
your carbon roorptint and save energy. Addirionally,
take your own reusable shopping bags with you so
you can avoid using the made-from-pet-roleum vari~
ety the stores typically rely on.
