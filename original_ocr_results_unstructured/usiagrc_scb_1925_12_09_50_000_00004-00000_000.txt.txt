The Scarlet and black stair presents
its mythical alermeviudn teams.

The learns have been selected \vitll‘
the view of recognizing the ability of;
players of all sections of the country
although undou'btedly some at the
greatest stars hav‘e been omitted be-
cause their teams failed to make in
pressive showings. Furthermore the
basis for comparing a good man on a
weak team and good man with able
support is too indeﬁnite to approach
any fair degree of accuracy.

The selections are as follows:

At Chapel
This Week

Tucsilnl'.

Professor L P, Sherman of the
chemistry department spoke in chapel
on Tuesday morning, using as the
basis of his talk the recent reports on
education published by Dartmouth
New developments are con-
stantly taking place in the educational
system. We arc living in a changing
world and education is progressing

lnen.

far but the question as to whether or‘

not we have yet reached the goal is
still open to discussion.

Professor Sherman cited the report
"Study of the Liberal college". This
report was made to the president of
Dartmouth college by Prolessor Itich-
ardson, head of the chemistry depart
ment of that institution. It was based
on observations ,made at nineteen dite
ferent American colleges, and at Eu—
ropean schools of note. Among the
institutions which contributed to Pro-
fessor Richardson's survey were Har-
vard, Brown, Yale, Amherst, Smith,
Oberlin, Chicago 11., Carleton, Toronto
University, Oxford, Cambridge and St.
Andrew's.

The book deals with extremely vital
material. Scholarship problems, pre—
sentation and discussion of the English
and Scotch systems lie within the
scope of his work.

Defining the purpose of college as:
"To arouse in the students a real ins
tellectual curiosity and interest," Pru-
tessor Richardson summed up the
most vital factors which could be era.
ployed in making the intellectual an»
peal powerful and attractive. Among

 

Guards: Schively, Illinois; Lentz,

these he listed the following; A curri—

culum based on the capacity and inter-
est ol thc individual; abolishinent ot
the principle that certain su'hjccts
should be required; elimination of the
snap major; smaller sections; insist-
cncc on the mastery and practical use
of the main facts of a subject: einr
pllasis placed on thinking rather than
memoi lng; increased discussion,
greatcr use of exams; emphasis on
good teaching, the assignment of
teachers to their work according to
taste and qualiﬁcations.

Professor Sherman also cited the
report of twelve Dartmouth seniors on
“Undergraduate Education," This re»
port advocated a modiﬁcation of the
Harvard tutorial system, the abolishr
ment of lectures, smaller groups, more
\\ ittou papers, and individual consul-
tation with the instructors. They also
recommended that the required courses
should he made comprehensive and be
designed to furnish a background or
information; that fluent use of a mod-
ern language should be required for
graduation, and that there be definite
tranmg and thinking—in adequate
written and oral expression.

Mr. Sherman concluded by saying
that thcse general aims were closely
related to the problems discussed at
the recent State Student Conference
and that national education was cone
stantly ‘hecoming m_nl'e and more in-
fluenced by such an educational pro-
gram.

Monday.

Excerpts from Gl'inncll college cata-
logues were read by Miss Clara J. Ann
dersen, director of physical education
,for women, in her chapel talk Monday
morning,

One of the catalogues from which
she read, bore the name Iowa college,
of Davenport, the original name and
location of Grinnell. It stated that
one of the reasons (or moving to Grin-
nell was the high cost of a sidewalk
that was being built by the college
grounds in Davenport. From an early
college law she read that at one time
Grinnellmien and women were allowed
to associate only on Saturday after—
noons unless they had special permise
siou from the faculty. Miss Anderscn
remarked that since there were 300
students in college at that time, some

 

member of the faculty must have had
a steady job.

Miss Andersen, later
turned her
student and told of his "fussy mind"
which he allowed himself to have due
to worry over the rush cl school work
and activities.

Tile same “fussy mindn could be
found almost everywhere now, she
stated, owing to the rush of Christmas
shopping and the attempts of women
to "buy a pair or $3 gloves marked
down to $2.29."
