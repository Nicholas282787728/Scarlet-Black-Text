Prof. Smiley Talks on
“Climbing Mountains”

Prof. C. N. Smiley spoke at the Y.1\I.
c. A. meeting held in the club room
of Clark hall Thursday night on
"Climbing Mountains.” William Mil-
ler sang two solos and Loren Adair,
who acornpanied him on the piano, af-
terwards played two piano solos.

The essence of Mr. Smiley's talk
was that there is not any important
job or work that does not have druos»
cry in i that one must go through
this certain amount of drudgery or
one will never have the iniportant’job
or the important work. "In order to
be a top-notcher you must go through
this, to have the joy and thrill of a big
achievement." He applied this prin~
ciplc to climbing mountains and
summed .up his talk with its applica.

, [IPINN DEBATE

Parsons and (irillilcll “'(uiwll ii"
In Duill (Ill Child Labor lruus.
, tori Score Will.

A genuine clash arguments by
women debaters who were well
[armed with regard to thc sulncct un-
der discussion made the Parsons»
Grinuell debalc on the child labor
amendment last Thursday night, one
or the best women's debates ever
staged in Grillllell according to many
who witnessed the dual.

Prof. J. 17. Carroll. of Drake Univer-
sity, who was the sole judge of the
contest awarded the decision to the
Parsons debaters.

in-

In opening the case [or Grillncll,
Janice Morrison attempted to Show
that state regulation is nut adequate
for handling such an acute problem.
Not only has state regulation failed
Ehecause there has been a poor code
of laws, but there has also been pour
{inspection and enforcement. More-
over, the amount. 01 child labor now in

use is detrimental to the child, to in.
illustry, and to labor.
Virginia Hayes continued the affirm-
iutive arguments by attempting to
VShow that the need for child labor
lilau's which had been admitted by both
teams could he met only by national
laws. She further developed What was
considered ti) be one of the basic af-
ﬁrmative arguments in that, not
[blanket federal law for all indust es
lwas proposed, but rather a law which
admitted the differences between Varir
‘aus industries in diflercnt sections,
and contain such clauses as would
recognize these inequalities.

a

Martha Hawley closed the case in
Grillnell by declaring that the affirma-
itil'e believed a federal child labor
iallendment was both desirable and
1prnctical, The present system is not
merely a local problem, she said, it is
_a national menace. states are help.
less, she maintained, when it comes to]
enforcing their child labor laws; the
broposed amendment would not vice.
late state’s rights, and anyway the
‘added expense of a system of g
inept inspection would he ncgligible.

Music Lovers Soon to

Hear Organ Recital
Every Week.

Grillnoll music lover will have an
opportunity to hear a concert of organ
music every week, in the near iuture,
it was announced yesterday by Dean
James Findlay,
to the
student

This idea owes its origin
iavorablc reaction of the
body toward the recent Levltslli re-
cital more than to anything else. The
question was asked, "if Grinnell stil-
dents appreciate good mnsic, why not
give then more of it?" A recent in.
vestigation tour or the dormitories by
Dean James Findlay resulted in an al-
mnst unanimous approval of the idea
by the men. Mr. H, w. Matlack and
Frof, CT. Herbert Knight have both
agreed to furnish the music alternat-
ing each week. ..

The plan is that cvery Wednesday
noon an organ recital be given from
1 to 1:30 and that students may come
and go as they please in a free an in—
formal inanner. It has been further
suggested that each selection be pre.
ceded by a brief history and resume
of that particular wor ~ so thatthe se-

lection may be appreciated to its tull- .

est extent,

The program will begin either next
week or the week after, depending up-
on how soon the programs can be
drawn up.

Leppcr, all debaters whose stage pres-
ence marked them as seasoned speak~
ers. ,

Although the rebuttal was lnrgely‘ a
quibblillg over arguments which had
been presented in main speeches, meni-
hcrs of both teams exhibited a credit»
nlile knowledge or the facts which
were presented in clear, concise fash—
ion.
