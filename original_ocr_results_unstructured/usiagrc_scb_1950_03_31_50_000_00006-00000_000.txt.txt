s & B critic Lauds
S’rage Rendi‘lion of
'Wingless Vic'l'ory'

By Ken Schwartz

it appears that Mr. Kent An-i

drews has mastered the produc—
tion problems of our very inade-

quate stage. We saw “The Wing-E
less Victory" Wednesday night at;
and although}

dress rehearsal,

the performance was lacking
cohesion and pace in the first
two acts, the play promises to
be the most finished production
ztt Grinnell in a long time.

Rey Polished

Adelha Rey brings profession-
al grace and finish to the action
as the malay who is more Christ»
ian than anyone else. Her emoa
tionalism in the poetic tragedy
is balanced by the stoic, yet he.
lievable Nathaniel at Jack Red-
dan. If anything, the super-
charged emotion in the last two

acts may wear on the college

audience. This is mostly the
fault of the author who culmi-
nates all in a Greek—like Vfinish.

When hurling Puritan invec—
tlve, Charles Dickens’ deep
voice cal‘l‘iés across Phineas but
often fades into himself in the
calmer scenes. The matriarch of
the embattled family is sternly
and ably cal’rled out by Caroline
Lelnhauser. Stu Oskamp adds to
the principals with the ne’er do

All others adequately involved‘

Roller Sets

Costumes and scenery are ex-
cellent, The sets are on rollers,
“wagon sets,” the McQuestony
living room moves to the backl

ot the stage and the cabin of the
ship in the last act can he sepr

al'ated and wheeled into the

wings, There is a fine illusion
oi depth in the set of the rirst
act which we have not had be»
tore.

Those who will be there ri
day and Saturday will have al
powerful evening of the theater,
convincingly acted, and realistic—
ally produced down to Adelka
Rey’s sarong.
