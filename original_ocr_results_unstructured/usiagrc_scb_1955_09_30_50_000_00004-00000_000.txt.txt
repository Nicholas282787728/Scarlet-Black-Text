Four Teams Tied For Firsf

by Special Dispatch

At the end of two weeks of
Midwest conference play, Carle-
ton, Coe, Ripon and St. Olaf are
undefeated. They have amassed
a total of 224 points to their
opponents’ 73 in five games.

'Tl’lls Saturday one of the four
will drop from the select group.
however, since Ripon travels to
St. Olaf. This will be the big
test for the Ripon Redmen, who
showed surprising strength in
rolling up a 32-0 frrst-half lead
over Monmouth and went on to
win 38-6 this past Saturday.

St. loin! [Favored

The Oles are substantial fav-
orites, however. largely on the
basis of their powerful line,
which is two-deep in experienc-
ed players at most positions.
Ripon’s chief strength lies in the
accurate passing of sophomore
quarterback Pete Mattiacci, who
has pitched six touchdown passes
good for 201 yards in tow games.

St. Olaf had a breather this
past weekend, rolling to a 51-0
win over Northland college.
Northland was scheduled to take
the place of Lawrence, which
had to cancel its first three
games. st. Olaf beat Grinnell
34-0 in the opener.

Coo l-las Breather

Carleton should cop its third
win (and eleventh in arow
over two seasons) at Monmouth
this Saturday. The Carls had
an easy time with Knox, win-
ning 26-7, while Monmouth was
absorbing a we beating at Rip-
on.

Coe's z-o conference record
will not change since the K0—
hawks take on non-conference
Loras instead of Lawrence, as
originally scheduled. Coe trounc-
ed Grin-hell 39-14 last Saturday
night.

Onceebeaten Cornell and
twice-theaten Knox square off
at Knox in a Dads’ day tussle,
with Cornell heing given a
slight edge. Cornell lost to Carl-

Coe Eleven Unveils

To Humble Pioneer

The visiting Kohalwks sent
Grinnell down to its second
straight conference football
loss, scoring three touchdowns
in each half for a 39—14 victory
last Saturday night on Ward
field. The game gave Coe a 2-0
mark and a tie for first in the
loop with Carleton and Ripon.

Coe’s heralded backfield, said
to be one of the best in the
league, proved itself by piling
up a total of 497 yards total
offense, including 355 on the
ground and 142 in the air. Grin-
nell accumulated 223 yards tor
tal offence, which ordinarily
would be considered a good ef—
fort.

Pioneers too 74 Yards

The Pioneers were down 2041
before Sam Porter engineered a
74 yard march to paydirt. Gary
Pattschullreturned a kickoff 13
yards to the Grinnell 25 to start
the drive.

After running plays had pene-
trated to the Coe 47, Scotty
Walker scooted 28 yards to set
up a first down on the Coe 19.
