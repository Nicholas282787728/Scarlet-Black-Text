How Things Have Changed. .

by Brent Schondelmeyer

It smelt of history. The damp mustlness
pervaded the room. Books, newspapers,
cartoons, old photographs, bric abracrrom
way back and the onethingtnatbroughtthem
all to this location--something to do with
Grinnell,

I entered Grinnell Room in searchoisomEr
thing which soon became forgotten in endless
pages of the Shh. I search incessantly to
find out whu won the dollar prize [01‘ the
best phrase of ten words or less describing
Grinnell, I examined the logic behind an
editorial supporting hazmg oi lreshman, I
was impressed with what Carl Sandburghad
had to say to college in the spring or l925.
I wondered how many oi members of the
humor magazine were working tor “lieee
l-law" aiter having put a grin on the iace oi
Grinnell, I stumbled onto a picture of the
austere and most nuhle J.l3. Grinnell and
wondered if he turned over in his grave
when he read that “booze is back and back
big.“

I treaded careiully, as pages were thin
irom many days oi reminising. I could not
change the past nor would I want to, instead

The smiling iace oi Dr. George Frederic
Magoun greeted the treshmen or Grinnell’s
earlier days as they entered the hallowed
halls. Magoun, Grinnell's first President,
built the college into an "institution oili-
heral education with sound tinancial as well
as educational character."

I would let my wattle stompers become
saddle shoes and my Jacket would be a
racoon coat. I would cruise over to North
campus and she and I would stroll down to
the Strand to see the weekend talent show.
i would grow mutton chops. . well, iwould
try and I would be proud that l went to iowa
College I laughed, I smiled, I thought or
times past which I had not experienced
I thuught--“my how things have changed,”
at huildings come and gone and a small
chest.

Located in the tloor oi the Grinnell Room
a stainless steel plate marks a spot. “Bee
neath this marker lies a chest sealed in the

century and messages addressed tothemen
and women oi Grinnell College in the year
2055."
