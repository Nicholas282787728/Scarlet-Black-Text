Friars S’rar—l'
Lecl‘ure Fund
As Memorial

Plans to establish a permanent
lectureship on the humanities in
honor of the late Dr. John s.
Nollen, former president of Grin-
nell. college, are being made by
Fiiais, senior men’s honorary
society.

Last year the Friars gave $25
iroin the general iuud toward
a memorial, and ieit it up to
this year’s organization to de-
termine the nature of the me-
morial,

The Friars thought of the lec-
tureship, and after discussing it
with their advisers John Klein-
schmidt and Joseph Wall, and
with Mrs. Nollen, decided that
it would be the most lasting and
iitting memorial to Nollen, a
co-tounder and close friend oi
the Friars. ‘ ,

“It is not only a living mer
morial. but it fills a definite
need,” Hervey Nixon, president
ot this year's group, said. “There
is no lectureship in the human.
ities as there is in political
science and religion.”

Donations to the iund will
be welcomed, Nixon said. The
Friars will send letters to their
alunuil and other friends oi
Notion. explaining the me-
morial and its purpose.

Norm Cohen will give the pro.
ceeds from his production of
“Andromaqu-e," by .Racine. on
Feb. 23. 27, and 28. Tickets will
be sold for 35 cents.
