less in a few years our \vcstcrn
colleges will surpass those ot any
country of the globe. From the
consideration of the number of
students Professor Shorey passed
to the duty of the graduate. The
scholar is not alone a thinking
man, but one who understands
himself and those about him. The
scholar not only has a meditative
function but a constructive func-
tion as well.

The university has not only to
impart knowledge but to worlr
over our spiritual inheritance.

The cast has not yet lost its dis-
paraging conception of western
life and manners. In spite of our
scholarship the west has yet to
deal with the frontier man. on ac-
count of the influx of foreigners.
There isan intellectual level which
must be attained before we can
lay claim to being nearly so schol-
arly astlre east. In order to at-
tain this level a general rise is ne-
cessary. Those who try to rise
above this level are now pulled
down.

The doctors turned out by our
great universities will enable the
small colleges to ﬁll their chairs
with trained men, but the intel-
lectual level will not be raised in
this way, It must be raised by
the graduates of our colleges. The
uplitting force is in the culture
obtained in the class room and
this alone can raise the intellect-
ual stand. This culture is differ
ent from that obtained by master
ing aspecialtyi It is the condi-
tion of mind which comes from
the comparison of ideals and the
contemplation of the true and the
beautiful. Culture must come to
the young from the study ofthe
true and the beautiful. Our study
must be (or the purpose of substi-
tuting something for those forms
of culture which we are obliged to
forego. He who has appreciated
the xsthetic has in him a spiritual
vibration which makes him more
responsive to the Beautituh Every
man who devotes ten years of his
life to intellectual training has in
him the power to raise our stand-
ards to any of those ofEurope.
He may be at a disadvantage in
equipment in comparison with the

older universities. But he can
study the elements and become
as well acquainted with the works
of the old masters as anyone,

Another danger to the college
is up»to-datc literature. The 111'
erature of the past is the “term
tul'e ofmany presents. The lit
erature ot the present is of the

moment. The literature of the
past has stood the test of criti—

cisln through centuries. The
works that endure are those of
antiquity. The culture and
ﬁnement which are marked in the
face of the student afrer several
years of college training come
from the study of the classicepic,
drama and poems,

The Silver Bat.

The result of the Cornell game
leaves the baseball championship
for this year still undecided. The
silver but will continue to grace
the trophy ease in the reading
room, but its presence will not be
emblematic ct victory.

S. U. 1., Cornell and Grinnell
have each won two and lost one
league game. 5. U. I. withdrew
from the contest and left the othr
er two to ﬁght it out. Cornell‘s
faculty refuse to allow their team
to come here for a final decisive
game. and so the matter rests,
