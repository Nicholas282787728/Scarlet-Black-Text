life to helping mankind.

oi them was a woman. in 1559
the College was Inmetl irom

was no graduating class ior those who
would have graduated had gone to tile

The ChrestorEllis “dance" whicn was

with a. goodly supply oi eats, were

into a cnl'l'yall, it was a. gay crowd
that rolltd along over the hcautitul
autumn roads to Jones‘ Grvoe. stealing
all the accessible eambles when the
soil committee wasn't around, and
singing the usual repertoire oi classic
songs. The social committee was wait-
ing ior the lliulicliel‘s with two roar

cheerllll in tho iast tailing dusk. After
an hour of stroling and ﬁrcliglit talks.

FRESHMAN GAME OF LAST
NIGHT DISCLOSES
WEAKNESS,

FRESRMEN Glﬁiinuei LINE

George at Full-Back and Arnold
at Half Star for 1916
Score 21 to 3.

I2

The Freshmen showed their chaise
teristic lacli ot sense oi the ﬁtness c:
things by presuming to hold tho highly—
lcuiod 'Val‘sit)‘ Lenin to three tout-11-
downs in yesterday's game, To cap CD1.
clitilzt Judi" Morrison. their dillﬁrm'
tivc quarter back, stood on the ’Var—
siti 's 30-yard linc and calmly proceeded
to drop a neat gnnl iroin tile ﬁeli'l, a.»
the scccnd quarter was drawing in a.
close.

The ’le‘siti' team seems to have
struck a slump which promises to be
a bad one, Following the news that
Frey might not be able to play again
this year. this development sugars in
im- the success at the team in the
game with Ames a wcck troia today.
Prospecw at present are gloomier than
at anytime this year, and Coach brown
is devoting his entire waking hours
to the solution ot the problem at Ele-
vclooing about tour good men in foe
ﬁve days oi practice remaining herein
we meet the strong "Aggie" team.

It is almost Imperative that some at
the reserve backfield men show
enough ability to ﬁll the vacant place
in the backﬁeld against a strong team.
Martin was showing almost 'Vni'siur
calibre n. week or two ago, but inim—
ies‘ have kept him out of the game far
over a week. and he has not even air
.ptal'etl tor practice since Monday, It is.
hardly probable that he can get in.
shape {or next Saturday’s game. even
it he is able to get out for next week's
practicc. Unless one of the present
candidates shows phenomenal deve'lup—
nleiit next week, the team will u up
against nines with a back-ﬁeld th v'is
practically useless against one side of
the line.

Another puzzling ploblelll tor the
coach is the need tor a man to take
the place or Frey iii the line. Georgie,
ilic smashing i'llllrhack oi the Fresh»
intn, was able in gain consistently thru
right tackle last night Time alter
time he reeled oil runs from ten to
twenty yards tlnu this position. and
we cannot liclp lying awnkc at night
wondering what will stop the rushes
or Vincent. the mighty “Aggie" tail—
bi , when this iatal weahntss is dis
covered.

The game u ith the Freshmeu’
brought little but misgiving to the
minds oi the eli‘Illlsiasts who witnessed
the mntcsl, There certainly was sonic»
thing ruiidulnciltally wrong with the
work or the team, and it was a detect
or a combination ct dei‘ccts which must
be HIKII‘ﬂIIy changed it‘ the team is to
have even a fair season.

When we considcr that the Freshmen
wcrc uitboiit the services or Lingen-
rcltsr, tbcir sldi' lineman. and Carter.
the pick or the back-ﬁeld and captain
of the team, we cannot help wondering
what would Iiayc been the result had
those mcii been able to play. it would
have meant almost inevitable deicat for
the man to whom we liaic pinned our
hope. for thc s lvdtion ot‘ Grinncll foot»
poll Iiistori. It is hard to put such a
damper on the enthusiasm which al»
ways proredts the Ames game. but it
is ilCS! that he should not bolster up
our hopes by enthusiasm alone, unless
(ht c is some pr sport that those hope!
will be justiﬁed

 

HURREY!
