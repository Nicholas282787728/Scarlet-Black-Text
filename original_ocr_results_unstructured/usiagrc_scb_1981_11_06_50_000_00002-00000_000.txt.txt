by Laura Carter with Richard Letchinger

'l he [an meeting of Grinnell s Boaltl ul
'lrustees last wetkend resulted in the ap-
proval ol the Burling Library renovation,
pay increases for some faculty members
plus tenure lor two ol them and use oi col
lege faCilllieS during the summer by out
side groups. The board decided to delay a
deClsion on its South African lnveslments
however, and ' the main topic at the
meeting, the use of the increased endowr
ment, was addressed by only one concrete
proposal

The 27 members of the 31 member board
who attended gave the go ahead to the
library renovation after grants in excess of
swam were awarded the project last
summer. These funds brought the amount
ol money raised tor the project to approx-
imately 31 million The board formally ap~
proved the project and the design and the
ceiling price of the renovation was extend-
ed from $2. 7 to $3. 3 million The trustees
themselves are contributing $1 million of
the figure,

Work on the building may begin in four
to six weeks with the two-story ”pen»
thouse" addition constructed first, Presi-
dent George Drake reported at a laculty
meeting Nov. 2 that this part of the project

could be completed by the end of the school
year and books will be moved into the new
structure alter Alumnl Reunion Weekend
in earlyJune, The library‘s administration
will then be housed in North Lounge of the
Forum and may remain there into the rail
semester.

in other library business, the trustees
added $50,000 to Burllng's budget. This
money will be used primarily tor new ac-
quisltions.

The board also turned its attention to the
faculty. ln response to recommendations
from faculty and administration. the
trustees offered tenure and the rank of
associate professor to current Assistant
Professors Elizabeth Dobbs and Walt
Stone. Dobhs is a member of the English
department and Stone is on the staff of the
political science department.

The board also voted to appropriate
$52,000 for additions to the salaries of pro-
lessors and associate professors. This
salary addendum was proposed by Drake.
Executive Vice-President Wally Walker
and Dean ol Faculty Catherine Frazer
The raise will affect 12 percent of the faculr
ty by increasing salaries by three percent,
which amounts to supplements at $500 to

$1,100. The additions are retroactive for
1981782 salaries.

Campus facilities may be used during
the summer by outside groups, the board
decided. According to Drake. an ad
ministrator to run this program will be
hired this school year. In order to house

. groups comfortably during the summer.

some projects will be undertaken in addi-
tion to the renovations already scheduled
Dibble and Cowles Halls will still be
renovated this summer but air condition-
ing will also be added to Cowles Dining
Hall and Norris Hall. Plus. hot water

boilers must be installed for use in the

PRC and in Cowles' kitchen.

The question of how to handle Grinnell's
corporate investments in the apartheid-
practicing nation of South Africa was not
decided. According to Drake, there were
two reasons for tabling the issue. First, by
the time the question came up at the
trustees' Saturday morning session. near-
ly one-hall or the‘ members had already
lert and the remaining members did not
want to make a decision that would be
unrepresentative Second, the report on
the matter was given to the board orally by

the three»member investor Responsibility
Committee and the trustees wished to read
the report and then make a decision,

Drake stressed that the board is not
avoiding this controversial issue, but
rather, members will have more time to
study the question The issue will be ad?
dressed at the boards next oncampus
meeting, Feb. 5 and s

The use of the endowment was slated as
the main focus of discussion for the
weekend but was specifically addressed
only Thursday. Trustee Steven Jobs
described the session as "philosophical"
and Drake said the group talked about the
quality of a Grinnell education and the
linances oi the college.

Discussion between the trustees. who
want to protect the growth of the endow-
ment, and the administration, which wants
to use the endowment income, was
reported by Drake as "close. The board s '
one concrete idea for use of the endowment
was to create 'a special luild (or special
things for excellence in education ,
Drake. He, Walker and, Frazers only
reservation to this proposal was ,that the
fund could be built at the expense of the
basic program or the college.

by Beth Vilen

Last week SGA began issuing short term

niture auction will be used for the pro
gram.

Quoting the loan iorm, the program will
“provide students with another means of
attaining funds in the event of a monetary
crisis." Students may obtain loans up to
$50 repayahle within 30 days by contacting
'Teri Gould. SGA vice president, or Amy
Welch, SGA student coordinator, or by
dropping by the SGA office during one ol
the two weekly times which will be set up
