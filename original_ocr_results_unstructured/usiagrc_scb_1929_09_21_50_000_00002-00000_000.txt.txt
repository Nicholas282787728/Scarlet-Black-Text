STILL—N0 SUNDAY DATES.

one might attribute the ruling
upon Sunday dates to tradition. But
Grinnell, with an intelligent and len-
ient Spirit, has decided that traditions
which have no reason for existing
should be abolished. Sunday dates
are legal at only certain times or
the year, after spring vacation and
on several Sundays during the year.
There seems to he no reason for the
restriction on other Sundays. The
Sabbath is equally observed through-
out the year.

studies always require the same
amount of attention regardless of the
day of the week or the season Stu-

the matter has been overlooked be-

Campus Opinion

What do you think of the iron
fences?

Ruth Sankey: it seems to me that
Grinnell is getting to he more of a
prison than a college—especially so
when you look at the iron fences. One
would think that a girl of college age
could control herself more than a
criminal and she should have that
privilege.

Jean Busby: If they're necessary,
they probably are, but I think they're
childish.

Marguerite McFarlin: I feel as
though I were locked in a prison; at
least as I suppose a prisoner feels
when freedom is hemmed in by nice
pointed pickets.

Dorothy Sells: I think the
fences are all right—but will they
accomplish the desired effect? They
may create an antagonistic feeling
in the girls toward the faculty mem-
bers in chat e.

Lydia Thiedeman—Thcy do appear
unnecessary but I really think they
will do the work.

Azalea Arnold: I think they're un-
necessary.

Orville Ewald: Every day in every
way it is becoming more and more
like a. "pen."

Jane Evenson:

then will the air be pierced by cries
of the tortured, and the old wounds
will he opened in the side of Mother
Earth, and eventually the conquerors
will stand triumphant over the pros-
trate bodies of their foes At last
the slaughter will mercifully cease
and victors and vanquished will slink
away in various stages of nudity
dragging after them their mangled
limbs. Tradition points to the fresh-
men as aggressors in the age old
struggle, but the sophomores still
burn with the rememberance of last
year’s humiliation and they will sub—
mit neither graciously nor easily.

The Freshmensbphornore class
scrap is the chief necking party of
the year, and many a freshman
maiden has learned valuable lessons
in technique while watching the
fierce conflict. This aspect of the
struggle, though important, is only
incidental. The true function of the
