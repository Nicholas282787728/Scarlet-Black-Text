With a cast of just two,the latest GIMP musical

Jamie chuctstcln (john Bowers
‘06) and Cathy Hyatt (Laurie Girpa

modern-day New York crty. The two
tell their stories in opposite directions.

butl like that we see the vulnerable side
in addition to the exuberance and ego
tism."

Because the show is so painfully
realistic, it was easy for the actors to
relate to what their characters were ex
pericncing, .

“I know what that’s like to reﬂect
back on a couple years of having been
with someone and know that you
screwed it up, and at the same time it's
nobody’s fault," Bowers said. “I drew on
some ofthat with Jamie"

With such a small cast, the dynamo

“It’s all very sensitive. If one of us
has a bad day, that’s halfthc cast,” Bow-

The personal atmosphere at re-

team to create a true chemistry that
permeates the show and that they hope
also reaches the audience.

“1 blocked the show, but the actors
had a lot ofinput in what they thought
about it and that built a feeling Ofrlnl’l’
macy that is extended to the audience,"
said director D id DeGeest ‘06. “No

form. The emotions that these people
experience are commonplace but they‘re
complex as well,"
