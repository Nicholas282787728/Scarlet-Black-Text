FINAL

It is rumored that. since the
faculty and the Student council
have ruled against an extra day’s
vacation, the Friday following
Thanksgiving day, pet ions will
soon be started by the students.
as a plea for the added da_ in
fact, one or two are already cir-
culating,

The uselessness of such moves
is apparent. The Student council,
representing the student body
thoroughly investigated the pos-
sibilities of getting the extra l y,
before giving its decision, and dc-
cided against the desired extra
holiday after several conferences
with the registrar and other per-
sons in authority.

The reasons brought out ill these
sessions are as follows: (1) the a‘l-
important fact that the No 'l
Central association, of which G n»
nell college is a member, requires
a certain number of school days
per yea and another holiday' is
not pos lblc, Since it has been
necessary to condense the cal (and .
for economic reasons; (2) that
the faculty granted the students
a Victory day without cuts and
(3) that surh 1‘. holiday would
seriously impede the preiu Minn
for the :l‘l college 17"oflllot on of
“The Mikado,” to be givzii in
December.

It is ill the student's blood to
want vacation (lays whenever he
can get them. But there are times
when it would be unwise to de-
mand them. This is one of those
times.

The Grinnell faculty has been
cooperating with the student body
by granting Victory day, taking
salary cuts, etc. If this is to con-
tinue, the student body must oo-
operate also with the facult,.

Grinnell Touchdown Called
Back in Drake Tilt

Although crossing the goal line
once, and having many opportunities
to score, the Little Pioneer freshman
football tcam was forced to accept
a are verdict against the Drake
first your men in p, mouoteuous game
played cu Waro field last Saturday.
The most noticeable feature of the
Grinnell offense was a pass combina-
tion from Julius Baurs to Bob and
Bill Evans. 0:. one occasion the ball
was successfully thrown and caught
over the goal line, only to be called
back on c, penalty. Penalties were fre-
quent and they, with many time out
periods, marred the game.

The Griunell line showed a great
deal of power on defense and man-
aged to open holes in the Drake wall
on many occasions. Jim Bradley was
cue of thc lumlnal’les for the locals,
Although not carrying the ball, he
was accurate with his tackling and
blocking. Burrows and Malum were
outstanding on the line for the props.
Clarence Wi iama and Al Both
were in Iowa City last Weekend
where they witnessed the Iowa

Grinnell college. Pioneers all, they
were, but not the last Pioneers.

While nearly all of the econ-
omic world is at a standstill and
in a state of fear, .1 small group
of hardy pioneers are promoting
plans to build a greater Grinnell.
The Pioneer recreation center is
their immediate dream.

Two weeks ago the Pioneer re-
creation (rcliter was on unauthori-
ti rumor. Last night every man
in the dormitories had heard pro-
posals for the project through of-
ficial channels, Almost every re
rest‘utative men’s ot-galli ation on
the campus had voiced it npprov
al of the project and pledged their
support.

Too much praise can not be
given the daring lcudcl‘s 01' this
movement for the Pioneer recrea-
tion center but it is not praise
that these men need. They must
have the whole-hearted support of
every man on the campus if Grill-
llcll’s Mcthusclollean dream for a
union is to be l-calizcd. It awaits
only your approval and support.
Let’s go Pioneers.
