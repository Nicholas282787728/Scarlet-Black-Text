oiiils,

He denied saying anything about the

Although the student reported that
the interview went well in general
terms, she stated that there were
times slit: thought the detective asked
unnecessary questions or made un-
warranted statements.

She reported the detective told her.
“You know the chances of ever iinding
him (the alleged assailant) are one in
a thousand. And then when it happens,
it's going to be a very embarrassing
situation for you and (or us."

She reported that the detective adds
ed: “You know, right now, we can
iorgct this whole matter it you like."

The detective denied making these

said he told her to drive out into the
country outside ot town. When the car
was a certain dismnce out of town, the
alletZed assailant directed the student
to stop. She reported that he had
helped her into the back seat and that
he threatened her with a weapon, He
molested her, she said. and told herrh

reported that he was trying to scare
her into keeping quiet about the luv
Cldents. Then She said he left me car
and walked away.

The student stated that She was in a
state of shock but able to drive to a
friend's house. There her friends
helped her calm down and may went
to report the alleged incident to the
police.

At the present time, two questions

had prevented the police from inter-
viewing her as or Wednesday.

A second question revolves around
misunderstanding of the procedure the
police would use in a case of sexual
abuse. After an open forum on rape
last year, women on campus related
the impression that they believed

would always call in a matron to hear
an alleged victim's evidence. Chief
Peters has stated, however, that he
understood that he would call in the
matron to hear evidence only if the
victim was unaccompanied by a
female friend or relative.

In this case, the student met alone
with the male detective for her inter-
view. Chief Peters said there was
no matron called in because this was
not the preliminary report ttlie report
immediately after the alleged crime)
and that he did not perceive the need
since the student was not emotionally
