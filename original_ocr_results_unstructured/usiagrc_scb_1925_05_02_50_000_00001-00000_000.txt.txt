A dope story on track this early' in
the season is a little uncertain. Neithe
er teams have been in enough compe-
tition to show up the individual abil-
ities of the men. Nebraska seems to
have _a little the best of the meet on
paper, due to their likelihood in grah-
ing on more seconds and thirds than
the Pioneers. The first places
should split about even, with possibly
Gl'innell having a little the best of it.

heading the list is Locke who ran

rirst Senior Clmpel Service.
rrid y Monti

lit

President Main opened the series of
Friday Senior chapel services. Mali-
ing platitudes live in our daily inter-
course was bis theme. He explained
that what we call a platitude is that in
form only; the core of the meaning
has not yet been touched. It is a hit
of dynamite that has not yet exploded,
an ideal unrealized, a spiritual force
that has not yet been set to work. The
Golden Rule contains enough dyna-
mitc to make a new world, and the
story of the Good Samaritan contains
a treasury of platitudes which have
not yet projected themselves very far
into human activity.

Among the blackegowned people im-
mediately before hime President‘ Main
said there had been formed a group
consciousness, a fellowship, based on
platitudes of loyalty and co-operation,
evolved [tom the smaller group of
home and prophetical of a larger fel-
low iip to lcome. “W1litl I want you
to realize is that these glorious plat-
itudes are in you now, and wllzttever
is to come must come from them,
7“They are ,‘tbe source ct your acli—
ievemcnt. They are life!" There is
not today in our Capitol enough or
this group consciousness. "If we can
carry out‘ the idea of co-operation for
the common good we strengthen our
democracy where it needs strengthen-
ing.

This reach alter a something that is
beyond our reach, our sight and un—
tlertsandillg is elemental and the cniet
demonstration of our lllinlal'tiill'ty, The
greatest platitiide we know is “God
is Love." Though we shall never see
lliui, because He is one of the influ-
ites, we may know Him by exercising
HIS qualities in u It is our duty to
make creative that amazing pintitude
of Paul’s “In Him we move and have
our being," and of Jolnrs, “Nap are
we sons of God."

The Griniiell college Glee club scor-
ed a distinct success with the large
audience which attended its thirtye
first home concert in Hcr ck chapel
last night, The program contained
rather heavy numbers, and although
the club‘s work was Somewhat er-
ratic, the average struck was consis—
tent with tbe former work or the on

ganizatiou.

Starting their program behind sche-
dule. the men seemed to be trying
to make up [or lost time in From-
eroe's “Vagabond Song," which was a
breathless race to the finish, without
much precision or ensemble. But by
their second group they had gained
more poise, and handled the rollick-
ing “The Joyous Mom is Drawing
Nighx“ (Pnrry-Rhys-Herbert) in a
hearty fashion, the lower voices
standing out in firm unison. Thee
preeminence nfciew tenor voices de-
tracted from Dowland's "Come Again
Sweet Love.”

The feature \of the program was
Philip Kalsr's group of baritone solos.
Always popular with Grinnell audi-
iences, nlr. Kalar was never better re—
eeived than last night; "Vulcan's
Song." (Gounod), "On The Road to
Mandalay," (Speaks), and “The Tear,"
(Rubenstein) were enthusiastically
applauded until the soloist responded
with two eucores, “0!: Didn’t. it Rain,"
a Negro spiritual, rind the ever popu—
lar “Bells of St. Men The accom—
paniments of Mr. Adair were quite
sympathetic and pleasing.

Mr. Adair-is piano solo, “Spanish
Caprice," (iroszkowski), and encore,
were played with splendid precision.
vigour, and feeling. Mr, Peck-s violin
solo, Mendelssohn‘s “Andante Concer-
to in E Minor" and his encore were'
donc in his usual easy manner, and
were well received by the audience.

“The Morning Hymn,” by Henschel,
which was one of last year's tavorites,
received a startling set back when the
bosses tried to change keys at a cru<
cial junctur ; but the higher voices
strove mantully and brought them
through to a triumphant finale. El.
gar‘s "Reveille," the most dil'ficult
piece the club has sang for some
years, was cruelly massacred ' in
spots, but the men managed to end
appr imately in tune. "Worship of
God in Nature," (Beethoven), and
“Son: of a Star," (Busch), both new
to locnl antlicuces, were very well
done Throughout the program, the
newer pieces were sung with more
spirit and abandon than those which
the club has rendered in previous ap»
poal'ilnces ‘

The closing groups were perhaps
the best done of all the ensemble
numbers The club hit its high spot
in McDowell's “Crusaders," a brilliant
and difficult piece, descriptive of the

march of an English crusading army,
