The chilling reality of a bleak Iowa

winter can get you down. Thus an
adventurous (irresponsible?) group
of oriunellians (four students; two
grads) took matters into their own
herds and, searching for a Nirvana
of greener glass and sunny skies,
departed for the Mardi Gras - New
Orleans, Louisiana.

The participants were Paul
Doughty, Terry rinn, myself, Kandy
Sebring, Eldonna Sides, Cindy Roby,
and one Old, but never faltering
Chevy Belair.

Deep in the South we discovered a
new world of people and parades; of
sunshine and T-Shirts; of Boone’s
Farm Apple, strawberry, and Wild
Mountain wines r a world drawn the
gether by Canal St. and Rampart’s
huge flashing sign calling “JOY".

Here Walking was impossible, one
just flowed with or struggled against
the general movement of the masses.
"Everyone in the United States must
be here on Bourbon St.," cried one
voice. "Baa, baa," bleated another,

Here throngs lined the streets for
the endless procession of paradesi
Keeping with tradition, marked rir
ders on elaborate ﬂoats tossed coins
(aluminum) and jewels (beads) to the
peasants (us). Whether fulping down
Hurricanes or conducting mock
jousts with sugar cane lances in the
open market, we were easily abs
sorbed into the French Quarter
crowd so displeasingly known to the
city fathers as “gypsies - long of
hair and short of cash.”

We had thought we’d sleep in the
city parks, but the New Orleans Poe
lice Dept, thought differently: “it’s
against the law. We've got buses
ready and we’re going to ciearthem
out tonight.” Wouldn't that be a lot
of work, we inquired of one parti-
cular officer? ”not for us r for the
next shift, and,” unconsciously tap-
ping his night stick, “they're fresh.“

So much for parks. But in a chance
meeting With Brian Carroll(Grinnell
'71) outside the Hotsy Totsy, or was
it the she M0 Club, our entire troupe
was generously invited to the flat
he shared with Jeff Stroope in Ei-
lOXi, Mississipp . This was a Special
treat for Cindy, who had been born in
Eiloxl and wanted to see it “...ber
cause I’ve never been there before ”
Many group escapades and decisions
often seemed to be governed by simi-
lar logic.

This article, as written to this
point, reflects only the fun and ex-
citement of carouslng about the
South, but there were sobering as—
pools to our trip as well

The face of a young black girl:
she offered not a sound, but a big
tear slid down her cheek as she and
other children stood behind a curb-
side parade barricade, their View

in the street, The white pollcema :
joking about the NAACP; speaking
of the black shoeshine boy leISh‘
ing his partners shoes ”He's a
good boy , he works,”

This was a vacation from school,
but not from learning. The world
outside the classroom is as much a

teacller as the classroom itself; new
people, new ideas; stereotypes tern—
pel'ed by doses of reality.

Listening to the tall tales of ans
cient “Pretty Boy Hardy” inaback-
road Mississippi Cale: “Where are
you from . lowa . you’re Yankees."

“What are you,” from yet another
police officer, “professional hip-
pies?” We explained that, no, it
was only part time work He was
not overly impressed by our college
credentials either ”A communi-
cations major? What are you going
to be, a telephone operator?”

One cannot overestimate the im»
portance of the participant-obser-
ver’s role, one which balances and
supplements the knowledge gathered
in the role ofa formal student, We
were there in New Orleans mingling,
interacting with the crowds: with
young people very much like our
selves, and you people very much
unlike ourselves; with the tim-
ousined rich and the footsore come
moners. There were great and fun
times experiences in New Orleans,
but drawn from the many memories
that encompass that trip to the South,
there are many things also to be
learned,

Grinnell College’s isolation is often
considered to be one ofits most dis-
tinguishing and valuable qualities.
Supposedly students from across the
land and professors from the best
graduate schools come to Grinnell
to get away from the blight of the
cities and to spend their time with
other people like themselves—rin
quiet thought and study.

particularly during a long cold
spell like we’re now experiencing,
however, the “academic atmos-
phere” sometimes becomes oppres»
sive to the point that we want to
leave the campus to visit and have
fun in some new environment. This
impulse is very human and should
not be discouraged. The question
becomes, Where do we go?

A popular answer is to visit the
Amana colonies for a much better
than-SAGA-meal. Some people also
find a trip to Des Moines refresh-
ing, although a few people argue
that the cultural attributes of the
Women’s Gym warrant more at-
tention than anything the capital city
can offer. A number of people Visit
iowa City and Ames, two other Iowa
college towns that sometimes pro-
vide a necessary change from Grin-
nell’s isolation.

But have you ever heard anyone
suggest going to West Branch, Iowa?
I hadn’t either until sometime last
winter when it occurred to me that
it might be interesting to visit the
Herbert Hoover Presidential Muse-
um and Library that are located in
the bustling little city of 1320. My
hunch proved correct, the hour and
a quarter drive east on 180 was well
worth it.

The Presidential Museum has been
expanded and redecorated inthe past
year in order to accommodate a
great number of new items of in-
terest. Included in the Museum’s
collection are photographs and ex-
planations of some of Hoover’s ac-
tivities as a national and world poli-
tical figure in the second quarter of
this century. Those interested in art
will find some very nice pieces of
Mrs. Hoover’s china and embroir
dery, 0n the Museum grounds, the
visitor can also see the two-room,
Wooden frame house in which the
President was born, the black-

smith’s shop where his father
worked. and the Quaker hall where
Hoover attended his first Friends
meetings. The graves of President
and Mrs. Hoover are located on a
beautifully landscaped hill overlook—
ing the large park area in which the
Museum-Library building is Sltr
uated.

a visit to the Museum could occupy
an afternoon; the resources availr
able at the Library could provide
primary research material for
weeks or even months of study. For
the student or professor who wants
to examine some aspect olAmeri»
can history, politics, or economics
anytime from 1920 to 1933, the li-
brary is excellenti Grinnell students
and professors seem simply not to
be aware of this Very valuable lir
brary facility less than 75 miles
away. The possibilities of usingthe
Library for independent study pro-

jects and other research activities
are extensive indeed.

The document collection is parties
ularly strong on financial and come
mercial matters during the 1920's
when Hoover was Secretary ofCom-
mel‘ce and on all aspects of the
Hoover Presidential Administration
which ran from 1929 to 1933. Also
covered very well are the 1928 and
1932 elections and the Hoover Come
mission hearings on Governmental
Reorganization in the late 1940's.
Permission to use all the materials
can be easily obtained by writing to
the Director of the Library; re—
search librarians are very helpful
once access to the collection is
granted.

So keep West Branch, lowa iii mind.
The next time you are trying to find
something to do. hop in a car and
pay the Hoover Museum and Library
a visit. You’ll be glad you did.

The Scarlet and Black

by Ron Metlvir

It’s taken me a lot of guts to write‘
this review. Changing your mind on
paper is not easy. However, Heel
that if Muskie can change his mind
about Vietnam in two years, I can
surely change my mind about an
album in two months. The album is
Paul McCartney’s album, wild Life,
featuring his new group “Wings”,

Let me make one thing (perfectly?)
clear. I STILL think the group is
lousy, The drummer is sueringo
Starr and Danny Laine on guitar is
dry and unimpressive. Linda Mc-
Cartney has the worst voice heard in

many a year; she makes Melanie
sound like Joan Baez, However, this
album has some damn good songs.
Paul, it seems, is finally learning
how to make it on his own, Though
he still has a group behind him,this
album is delinitely "McCartney lll."
He keeps the group in the back
ground, where they should be ifthey
have to be anywhere. His songs are
far better here than they have been
on his previous solo albums. None
are as good as his better stuff that
he did with the Beatles, but the songs
are not secondrrate slog
One interesting thing is the style
of McCartney’s songs. when the
Beatles were a group, they in-
fluenced the music world for years.
Now, it seems, McCartney is in-‘
fluenced by others. in “Hip Bop”
his voice resembled Rod Stewart's
and in “Dear Friend", the piano
accompaniment sounds like a slow
Elton John arrangement, while Moe
Cortney sounds like Gilbert O’Sulr
livan, of all people. But Ifeel that
this does not make the album any
worse; in fact, it’s interesting to
see what music has influenced Paul.
As usual, Paul experiments with a
lot of different sounds, but he’sabit
more successful on this album.
”Mumbo” is an oldrtime rocknumr
her, with a vocal that consists of
doublertalk. It’s a tongue-in-cheek
look at the older songs with the
meaningless lyrics. The idea of
meaningless lyrics, however, is evi»
denced in the next Cut, “Bip Bop"
where three~quarters of the song
repeats the title over and over. How-
ever, fhe music is catchy, and you
find that this song you can‘t get out

Spectacular Expense Shows On Tube Flicks

by Robert Simmons

Last weekend was super spectacw
lar time on the tube. The Seven
Samuri, BenrHur, and Cleopatra
all had their 3-1/2 hour presenta-
tions, even though the Japanese
film was the only one shown comr
pletely in one sitting. The others
were divided up for two nights for
which there are good commercial
motives, but i suspect there is an-
other reason. The two American
blockbusters (both made in holy
and dominated by British casts)
are both nearly impossible to watch
in their entirety without succumbing
to an advanced case ofboredom. The
reason for this is fairly simple-
neither of them is if movie as much
as it is a display of a great deal of
money,

The Secret Weapon

In the ten years from 1947 to 1957
the average movie audience was cut
drastically by about 50 million tick-
ets per week as the result of tele-
vision Hollywood's reacion was to
give their movie audiences the things
they could not get in their living
rooms It Started with the color and

wide-screen processes then moved
to 3-D, Cinerama, and star-studded
casts. However, in the end the only
weapon that Hollywood could muster
and television could not was money.
So in true tinselrtown tradition
M-G-M set out to Spend $20 million
on a movie.

The purpose was not to make the
best possible film of Lew Wallace's
novel. The purpose was to use every
trick in the book to attract people
into their theaters where they would
be treated to a 371/2 hour film that
would exhibit as loudly as possmle
every penny that the studio had spent.
Big screen, big casts, big sets, and
no sense of taste or proportion were
cunningly combined into a hit

No Chariot Race, but...
The awards and success of Ben-
Hur did not go to the movie, they
went to what was spent on the movie.
Not to be outdone, 20th Centuryai-‘ox
(the names of studios would make a
good PhD. thesis) came up with
Cleopatra. They had not figured that
Elizabeth Taylur\would cause such
inflation of their budget, but they
hoped they could make up for the lack

of a chariot race (the naval battle
has a negative excitement factor)
with some sex One might have been
equally entertained watchinga pyra-

mid for a similar length of time.

when it was produced in 1954 as
the result of Kurasowa’s desire to
produce an historical epic, The
Seven Samuri was the most expen-
sive Japanese film made to thatdate,
It could probably have been financed
on the makeup budget of Cleopatra.
Its 200~minute Version is so well
put together as to be capable of
holding the audience's attention
without a break it is produced on a
fairly modest scale with no overly
showy displays, yet the film is as
monumental in scope as any men-
tioned above. The direction is so
skillful that one wishes it would
continue, not end i guess that is the
difference between making movies
and making money,

A request has been made fora short
plug for The Shapes of Love Film
Festival this weekend. I have not
seen any of these movies, but
Gnosis, an animated feature about
the problems of a lump of Clay, was
recommended as a winner.

Fetttuary 18, 1972

of your head

The third cut is a non-McCartney
song, probably the first recorded by
him since the early sixties. “Love
is Strange" is a fasterarrangement
of Micky and Sylvia’s song(rememe
ber them?)_ This song does not come
across well, as there is much inr
strumental, and the bandprovesthat
it possesses a great deal of no“.
talent, The song itself is corny and
trite, and shows that McCartney
should at least stick to his own stuff.

The more “Serious” music starts
with the title cut. "Wild Life“ is a
beautiful, quiet song, filledwith Mc-
Cartney falsetto and old, rich Beat-
le harmony provided by the band and
a good engineer. The song, on the
surface is about ecology, but one
can’t help thinking ofJohn when Paul
sings, ”There’s a lot of political
nonsense in the air/...You’re moving
too fast, / But you know not where.”
“Wild life" could also be talking
about the old Beatle days, and the
exciting times Paul and John went
through.

Continuing the feud between the two
is a song called ”Dear Friend.”
It's not biting such as John's “How
Do You Sleep at Night?" It’s rather
a melancholy song, as Paul asks
John if “it's really thebcrderline...
does it really matter?” personally,
I don’t get a thrill of listening to
John and Paul Cut up each other on
their albums, However, “Dear
Frien is a beautiful song, com-
plete with piano and orchestra.
Paul’s‘ vocal is first-rate, and the
song proves to be the best on the
album. (Interesting that none of the
other band members appear in this
song.)

The other songs in the album are
better than average, and they’re fun
to listen to. ”Some People Never
Know” and ”Tomorrow” have both
received much AM airplay, but they
remain enjoyable. And ”I Am Your
Singer” is another “Singable song"
and it’s nicely done, except for the
first four lines. That's when Linda
sings her only solo, and it's absor
iutely horrifying. She is consistent"
she remains a halfvstep flat!

Anyway, no matter what you heard
from earlier reports, and in spite
of “Wings” Wild Life is a good
album. The music is generally sim-
pler than the old Beatle tunes, but
this seems to be the trend. Songs
generally seem to b less of a pro-
duction, as they exhi t more of the
artist’s natural style. By the way, it
you carefully peel off the rose from
under Paul’s eye, there is a picture
of Ringo Starr as Frank Zappa kiss-
ing Theodore Bikel in “200 Motels".
And the Walrus was Paul.

Kasimow Accepts
Pos' ion Here

Harold Kasimow, a specialist
in nonrwestern religions and Juda—
ism, has accepted an offer to teach
