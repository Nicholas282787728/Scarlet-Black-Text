Founded In 1900

The Gates Lectureship, origi-
nally a fund of $1,000, was found-
ed by the class of 1900 in that
year for the purpose of aiding
one or more students in the stu-
dy of social conditions. A Writ-
ten record of the research Was to
be kept in the college library.

One provision of the grant was
that the tniStees of the college
could, at any time they felt the
above plan to be impractical, use
the income in another way to
further the purpose of the fund
The principle of the fund now
amounts to $2,270.

announced. A brief survey of the
statistics emphasizes this
pl'ovement.

The total calls at Miss Swan's
office during January, February
and March decreased from 2,397
in 1941 to 1,717 in 1944. The num
ber of infirmsry patient days drop-
ped from 680 to 286 in the Samc
period of time. The total num-
ber of Grinnell College students
sent to the hospital for more sex"
ious diseases showed the greatest
reduction, going from 99 in the
first three months of 1941 to one,
ly 7 so far in 1944 The drop nil
hospital patient days showed a
similar decline from 332 to so
The decrease may be partly Elt-
tributed to a severe flu epidemi
in 1942 which has been carefully,
checked this year. in spite on
wide-splearl epidemics during wai
years. ‘

So far we have lived up to our
slogan which was set last fall
for the school year 194344: No
Epidemics For Griiiiieil: At that
time, our campaign for Smallpox
immunization was 100 per cent
successful. Due to the splendid
cooperation of both students and
faculty. Grinnell College can claim
a wonderful health record, Miss

Reduci'ion oi
Salaries

Recommend Cul at
College Guarani'ee
For Ediior. Manager

That the college reduce the sal-
aries of officers of the Scarlet
and Black and guarantee a cer-
tain amount for editor and bus
mess manager of the Cyclone next
year is the substance of the mo-
tion voted by the Publications
Board at its meeting Wednesday.

The motion will be formally
recommended to President Stev-
ens to replace his plan of guar-
{antced salaries from the college
itu the editor and business man
lager of the Scarlet and Black \
which has been in effect since
1941. His statcment of that plan
submitted to the board three
years ago was personally with-
drawn at a meeting of the board
last Saturday.

The recommendation provides
for a guarantee from the college
of a minimum of 375 a semester
, for each of the editors and business
managers of the Scarlet and
Black and the cyclone, lf eith~
er publication is not selfrsuffiCr
iieiit to that amount, the college
would make up the difference.
Any profit over $75 up to 3125
would be divided between the ed-
,itoi- and business manager. Any
amount made over 3125 would be
contributed to the sinking fund
of the Publications Board. No
provision was included for the
l assistants.
