HANKSGIVING 'AFFAlRS ARE

usually dress occasions.
Starting with tonight, dress up.

The New KUPPENHEIMER

Overcoats and Suits are very
splendid this season. The over-
coats are especially pleasing,
pinchhacks, form ﬁtting and
loose backs all are good.

For the dance a new MAN-
HATTAN Shirt will add a

lot to your best appearance.

A pair of INTERWOVEN
Silk Hose at 35 cents or 50
cents will go well with the

dress shoe.
