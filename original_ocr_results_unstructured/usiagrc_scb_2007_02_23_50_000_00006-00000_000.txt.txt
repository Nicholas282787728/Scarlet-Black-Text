twentyeonc years, he has been preparing i’resh sniidwiches from
the back ofthe Varsity News Stand on Broad Street, carefully
weighing our all of the meats, tossing on a pickle or two and
serving everything over a large barrel. Since
converting storage splice in the News Stand
into the BACk Alley Deli, Dunfonli has served
thousands of customers from both the college
and the crinncll community.

Danforth began his association with rhe

'THE BACK All.“ DELI

the Back Alley Deli costs only 54.75, compared to 55.25 it the
Grille.

Dnnforth loves serving the “eclectic" miv ofcrrstorners tlrar
come into the Deli for lunch every day, and said serving stu-
dents is ”rilwrlys fun." However, the bcst part of running the
Deli is being able ro work every diy \Vllh his wife, Debbie.

Debbie Danforrh joined Dive it the Varsity News Stand
when the Deli first opened, and these days while Dave is in
the brrck of the store making sandwiches by his barrel, Debbie
keeps a watchful gaze on the rows ofper dicals neir the door.
“It's 1| great partnership," Dave said, and it allows him to con-
tinue making sandwiches without hiring ildditionill employees
during the rrnch horrr.

At the moment, Danforth is still enioying his 42 yo run
.rt both the News stand and the Dell, but admits he is looking
forward to his retirement, While Dnnforth s d he isn’t in any
rush to leave, he also added that ”ifiiuyonc is looking to buy a
dell. . lam ready to sell."
