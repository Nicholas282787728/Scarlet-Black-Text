The Dinosaur

This heauty unis designed by Robert Glenn
Craig, and stands at a startling 18 feet tall. Craig.
a professor at Drake, and a nephew of the Zirkles
namesake, designed and installed the steel and alu-
minum sculpture in 1994.

The design. like the Zitlde, is meant to core
respond to its surroundings, Craig he said he was
influenced by the line quality found in the matuie
trees on campus, the stonework nfGooduovl Hill
and the wedge spite oi land that the sculpture is
sited to."

Peiez, when led to this location fir from her
homo turf of Noyce saw philosophicrl meaning
in the tree like sculpture. It looks like a tree that
glows revolvers

She pointed to the whiter tnp, which to her,
looked sort oflikc an organic gun. "It says that na-
ture can be loving and cruel," she said,“like the na»
ture of man.”

Perhaps Perez was right. While Craig worked on
the piece he said he became “increasingly interc'sted

‘in how objects, such as machine parts and rocks, are

deliberately preserved by man and metamorphosed
by nature

Cox was a hit afraid ofit ofthe concept. “It looks
like if it fell over it would crush me. She likened
it to the work of some Russian sculptors, and said
that if it made a sound it would be a u>ceh boom"
stomp like in old machine. “Id call it composition
with hammer and siekle’,” she said “It's oppressive
and looming.”

The Zirltle

Situated between ARHend Noyce, the
Zirkle, a campus favorite, is actually an un-
titled sculpture. Built by human hands, it has
risen, at 153" tail, to the status oflcgcnd, Glenn
Zirldc, a Grinnell art professor, designed it and
had it fabricated in steel by the Johnson Mr
chine Works in Chariton, IA.

The Zirkle was the ﬁrst outdoor sculpture
on the Grinnell campus, installed in 1975.
From its anchor buried underground to its
towering top, it was carefully scaled to cor»
respond with its surrounding buildings and
outdoor environment. Rosie Perez ‘07, a Pl‘inT
ies major who passes by it often, posits that
it “is supposed to mean something scientiﬁc.”
Personally, she thinks it looks Like an inverse
donut. “It's so symmetrical, it looks Like some-
thing from Mathematica.’

The sculpnrre was Zirkle’s largest outdoor
pin-c. and with it he hoped to demonstrate it
commitment to public artwork. And public it
is, appearing in Titular Head turns and Joint
Board minutes. It‘s been viewed and used in a
Variety ofways. some students have new ideas
for ways students could interact with it,

Stephanie Colt ‘09, who is leaning
towards a major in the humanities, thought
that it would make a great maypolet “You
could build a bonﬁre around it," she said. “You
put ribbons on it and do a circle dance. And

you could wrap them around in the shape ofn
double helix.” ,

Standing out by Sixth Street like a beacon, the ﬁnal sculpture on our
list, was the most recently installtd, given to the college for Faulconei‘
Gallery's first exhibition in 1999,

The piece, which is titled Moi-Morn, eitprcsses the artist’s intent to
make a sculpture which mimics music The sixteen interlocking sheets of
steel rcpresent different musical parts or an orchestral whole.

one could look at anyindiyidual piece and try to follow it through its
twists and turns, or listen to the piece as an intricate whole. Our'att critics
saw it somewhat differently

“it looks like a jungle gym ofa thousand years from now,"said Perez.
“It looks like you could hide in it, ifyou were in the 11" dimension of
spacertime.” Perez looked at the spaces within the piece, "It‘s a simple cou-
cepr and can be seen in very different ways," she said. "It‘you‘re driving by‘it
looks like a big brown mess. You have to slow down and think about it.“

Cox, similarly, wanted to play on it. “I think it looks tongly, like briats
or a tangle of intestines," she said. “Someone could stage dive onto it."
She saw the sculpture as both a beacon of the colleges meaning and as a
defensive device,
