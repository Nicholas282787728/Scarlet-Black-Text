Anime or arpeggios?

Two Oscar winning classics, starring two adorable characters, are at Harris this weekend, The only differences between
the two: one has dragons, the other has Nazis

SpiritedAway (PG)

Bradley: 'l’he all.time most popular movie in japan is
in Grinnell' This Illllmc Fable is quite unlike Abra or othcr
martial arts heavy Japan-imatioii that might spring to your
mind. This fairy tale Follows Chihrro, a modern clayelcvcnr
ycrtreuld brat who, arrer separating from her parents,
stumbles upon a mystical bathhouse controlled by the old,
bigheaded Yiibaba, For the ﬁrs( time, the spoiled Cluhiro
must work for a living. In addition to her bath.
housc chores, Chlhito tries to save her pare
tnrs, and the enigmatic Hsku, a boy her
age who also works for Yulnba. Her difﬁ-
cult goals are turther eompliearod by
Na-an, an uninvited guesi to the
bathhouse,

Jeremy: i would add more

B: Spirited/way doesn't have a very linear story, which
sets it nparr from moSK children’s animation. Chihiro’s Jo-
seph Campbellrlike journey doesn't iollow the well.worn
paths—vsom: plot branches don't easily connect back to

the main story. because of this, some all ir slow or dull. .

No one dares call its style dull, though. The vibrant

animation is becoming less popular, due to Toy Story and

Jeremy’s Final Word: smart and stylish animated ﬁlms

The Pianist (R)

B: As Jeremy aiiell confessed several weeks ago. nelr
ther or us have seen this supposed masterpiece that
reoenrly won a Infect: of Oscars for Best Adapted

screenplay, BistActot (Adrien Brody). and Best Di»

rector (thccxiled Roman Polanski) Brody plays
Wladyslaw Szpilmau, a Polish pianist whose
promising career is interrupted by The Third
Reich, With the blast
of a bomb, his life’s
work changes to
simply surviving,
J: The film is
based on a true
story and, without trying to sound too insensitive, is Full}
ably pretty familiar ﬁlm territory. What supposedly makes
the Film great is the treatment ofthe material. Widi solid
production, brilliant direction, and great periorn-ianres, The
Pinter proves thara ﬁlm doesn’t need big name stars, bright
lights, or manic editing to be successful.

B. I'm amazed by how big ofa star Brody has become
due to this film. Before last year, his crowning achieve—
ment ivas being a soeondary character in Tb: Thin Red
Line. I guess that's what one remarkable performance, in
addition to one remarkable, nationally televised Freedom
Kiss with Halle Berry will get you.

Jeremy’s Final Word: At the top of my current must
see list. iiyou haven'rseen this ﬁlm yer, make the onion to
get to Harris on Saturday.
