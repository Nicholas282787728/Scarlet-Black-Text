ood For Thought - -

We are sick of all the griping about the
food, At first justifiable to some extent,

it has gone completely out of bounds A
little over a week ago, two-hundred people
signed a petition condemning 'the food
situation in Grinnell in no uncertain terms,
The petition was later dropped, but only
because the petitioners began to fear a kick-
back on this “crusade.”

If those who today sneer at the quality
of our food will go back mentally to last
summer, to the grocery counters and meat
markets and dairies, they will remember at
least a few of the difficulties of food pro—
curement. Oh, but the war‘s over . .

,still a long way to go. A great percentage
of our food is still being shipped abroad to
our own and to other peoples. The milk

shortage continues. As one farmer we
know comments, “It takes quite a spell to
grow a cow” . . . and many milk cattle were
slaughtered for beef during the Worst of
the meat shortag ,

The food procurement problem is be-
ginning to clear up a little. We talked to
grocers who note quite a definite improve-
ment. But the fact that it takes one in the
business to state authoritatively that there
is all improvement shows how far from obe
vious and widespread this is.

There are some dining room changes
that can and should be made, however, even
with the food difficulties wllat they are.
First and foremost is the need for a train-
ing table for the basketball squad. Always
before,‘wllen we have had a team, it has
been thought that they needed extra
calories each day to support their strenuous
activity. To us, this idea still seems valid.
The comparatively small amount of addie
tional food necessary to supply a training
table could, we feel sure, be found.

Guest accomodations are not what they
should or could be. The difficulties of get,
ting a guest a ticket and a table have be-
come so great that it is easier not to have
guestsiperhaps this was the aim of the
new rules. Difficulties in exchange accomoe
dations between Cowles and the Quad
dining room should also be rectified. They
only contribute to the growing gulf between
the north and south campuses.

Although
the correct amount of calcium in our diets
is being maintained in spite of the milk
shortage, we have had very little hot cho-
colate, pudding with a powdered milk base,
or any other food supplying this necessary
element lately. We understand that pow-
dered milk is available, and that many palar
table dishes can be made with it.

Aside from these easily remedied dee
lects, let us be patient while the kitchen re-
convertsiwhile, through a break-down of
long used equipment, Cowles dining'room
has trouble in opening its doors on time;
while supplies are low, and the farmers are
busily growing more milk cows.

American Music
Miss Sten has only praise for
(the American musical. scene.

‘American audiences hear music
without the disadvantages of
tradition and prejudice that
lcloud the impression of Euro-
pean listeners."

She sees a great-future for
music in America because “The
‘Americans as a people have the
background of every European
culture to draw upon."

. “Best of all,” she concludes. “is
the blessed survwal in America
of the spirit of tolerance and
open-mindedness. These elements.
so vital lo
development of art, seem to be
confined almost entirely to the
western hemisphere, and to he
icollcentrated in the Umled
States"
