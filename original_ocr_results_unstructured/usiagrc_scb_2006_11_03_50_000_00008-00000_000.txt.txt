The simian

Painfully laboring a la Tar-zhay Boutique

Working retail is a blast. It gives me that Irfcelr
myrbiainrcellSrmcltmg type of high. I definitely see
future prospects in it. I mean, screw college, I could
just work at Target for the rest or my life. There are
just so many entrepreneurial opportunities open to
me. For example. working there has made me more
global. Why, just the 0th
et day when I called the
gift registry help number,

I was connected with Iii-

dia. imagine. me on the

phone with lndiai How

excmngl I’ve never called , , , p .
anyone farther away than

Boston!

But the best part ofworking at guest service for
Target is the opportunity to interact with the public.
it‘s really quite lovely to watch customers (“gusts")
lose it when we tell them that we can't rcrurn their
79rcent dental floss without a receipt.

“Yes, ma’am, I can see that it’s from Target. Yes,
ma’am, I see the Bullseye in the corner. I see that
Bullseyc cvery ight in my sleep. But how can I know
that you didii’ t pick it up oftrhc shelves and say
that you've bought it? No, malam, asking me to shove
it up mine won’t get you your refund, but thank you
for trying.”

It’s amazing some of the seams people Kl'}’7r\nd
often manage—to pull oft. Like this womaniive call
her the Lunch Lady—who buys clearance clothes,
goes home, takes the tags off, attaches the new tags to
her ugly old eighties outfits, then returns themthe
rags march the receipt, so Wc up at guest service don't

pay any attention until the fitting room radios ovei
that we just took back clothes that we don’t entry.

The icason they can get away with so much is that
Target workers are never ieally all rherc. When work-
ing you become aware or the existence of stupidity
in its true, unadulterated form. And I'm not talking
puttingtcampustbikest
ontthetloggias stupid. I
got all A’s in my calculus
classes, but 15 minutes
into my shift and i can't
do simple subtraction to
calculate change if my
register breaks down. I
think there’s something
in tiie ﬂuoiescent lights that sucks the common sense
out ofus.

When I was working this fall break I had to call
the Target in Dubuquc for a guest
and after being put on hold was
disconnected twice before I ﬁnally
got through to someone. On the
thiid call I asked directly for the
store’s managerWhen the mari-
ager finally answered I asked hci
if there was an item in stock. She told me to hold
again (for Target, that's like the cashier asking for
money after you walk up to the cash register; it can't
rm! happen) because she needed to check herself. She
had no one working in the stockroom that night.

l’m soriy, what?

Not having any stockroom employees is like not
having any cashiers. it’s rather difficult to function

without them, although possibly manageable if you
lived in a crater on Mars. But thcn again, this was
Iowa 1 was calling.

So the manager goes and finds the items, and I
don't know ifshc used a walker or something, but in
the time it took her to do a location check, the phone
system, with only slightly less patience than I was
feeling, kicked me back to the operator. Finally the
manager returned and, as per usual, asked what name
to put on hold under, I give her the first name ofthc
“guest," who by now can't believe that a corporation
could be slowcr than her senile mother driving with
the parking brake on.

The manager asks for first, last and phone num-
ber. Honey, ifyour Taiget is so small that you don’t
have any backroom workers,i doubt you need a last
name for a hold.

She then asks me when the “guest" will pick up
the items. It's Z4rhour hold, so I
tell her, “Sometime tomorrow”

“Well, she needs to be. Vile will
only hold things for 24 hours."

OMFG, lenlly? I seriously had
no idea! Yes, I work for Targets
guest service, 1 am aware of our
own store's policies. But thank you for reminding me,
because sometimes i'rn returning an item and suds
dcnly think I'm working at the McDonald's. Wouldn’t
that have been awkward? Thank you, Ms. Manager
Woman, for your one insrghtl

Sometimes I think it might be better to work with
a melted brain. It would make dealing with my co-
working zombies that much casier,

Farce, satire and a healthy dose of cruelty

Two of the most popular comedir
ans among collegeraged youth today
are Stephen Colbert and Sacha Baron
Cohen, star of the new movie “Borat.”
Interestingly, those two use the same
comedic technique; always remaining
"in character," particularly when inter-
acting with others.

The comedian uses an affected
stupidity to insult the beliefs and p051*
tions of his targets. The targets are in
an awkwatd situation: if they buy into
the facade, they end up looking like idi-
ots. But the alternative is no better; the
comedian will refuse to break character
no matter how vehemently his target
challenges him.

We, the viewers, are thus treated to
comedy—through-humiliation, and we
find it hilarious. But when does that say
about us?

There is, I believe, a difference bet
tween comedy that simply makes fun of
someone and comedy that takes some
one’s worst ﬂaws and reveals them to
the woild in the victim’s presence.The
former is laudable, speaking to a belief
that no one is above mockery. But hut
rniliating someone in person goes ﬁirt

on the powerﬁll.
At the same time.l am uneasy about
denying society‘s leaders the same
measure of humanity that its ordinary
members are entitled to.The success of
our democracy depends on our leaders
respecting our rights as citizens and not
abusing the privileges we have granted
them via our collective votes (or Wah
lets). To reduce those leaders to meie
caricatures of human berngs would
seem to invite the reverse treatment.
Consider Colbert’s famous (or in-
famous) toutinc at the White House

Correspondents' Association dinner
earlier this year. standing next to Prcsir
dent Bush, Colbert dcl‘ivered a blister
ing attack on the president's character
by pretending to defend him against
“intellectuals"who believed in “leality.”

Much of the routine was directly
lifted from Colbert’s show. For my
money, the opening sequence of the
Colbert Report when he introduced
the term “truthiness” is one of the funt
niest sequences 1 have ever seen on
television. Those same jokes dellvered
to President Bush's face had a very
difrercrit feel. Colbert was not simply
“speaking truth to power," which is
always a good thing. He was wielding
rrony maliciously in a way very differ
ent from how, say, 2004 host jay Leno
roasted President Bush.

I for one intend to see “Bout" as
soon as I cant Based on the first four
minutes posted orrline and advance
rcvicws,l expect 1 will greatly enjoy it.
But I Will not be able to avoid the cruel
side of Baron Cohen's humor, and that
recognition will weaken what could
otherwise be some of the funniest 82
minutes of the year.
