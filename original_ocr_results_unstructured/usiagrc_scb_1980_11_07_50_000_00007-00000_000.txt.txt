Computing Capacity expands

Computer

Last summer, a new PDP 11/70 coma
puter was added to complement the ex
isting ii/70.

Anne Pipal. stall programmer for the
academic computer, explained that die
administration had been expanding its
usage or the computer andrdemanding
more time. At the same time, however,
academic usage was growing. The two
conﬂicted and the system slowed down
considerably.

It got so bad that at one point prer
programmed computer games were
removed from the memory A number
of times the computer reached its
capacity.

The need for expansion was obvious,
the question was how. Mark Grundler,
director oi Administrative Computing
and Computer Operations; Robert
Noyes ol lntel, a major manutacturer
oi computer components; and is»

ecutive VicerPresident Waldo Walker
came up with a solution alter talks with
the administration and faculty. Noyes
and Walker presented the idea to the
Trustees and convinced them to pur»
chase another 11/70, rather than
“tradein” the old one and buy a larger
computer.

The cost of the new 11/70 and
peripheral equipment {or both units
was, according to Grundler, approx-
imately $190,000, He said that it would
have cost at least $100,000 more for Just
the hardware of a larger computer,

Also, according to Jack Stafford,
start programmer [or the ad-
ministrative computer, the larger com-
puter being considered was “not ready
lor the data management" needs or the
college,

So now the college has two identical
units. The new one is used entirely for
administrative purposes and the old enr
tirely for academic Pipal pointed out
that this simplifies security, since only
administrative terminals can log onto
the administrative computer.

puter had only three disc drives, so if
one went out, the system would crash,
possibly tor days. Both computers now
have four interchangeable drives (only
three are used at one time) So that if
one breaks down, another will take over
until repairs can be made.

Because of budget constraints, the
new computer has only 256 K
megabytes (K megabytes describes
how much memory, or capacity, the
unit has) as compared to 334 K
megabytes on the old one, Grundler
said he hoped to increase both to 512 K
megabytes by next year. He added that
that depends on the budget.

With the new computer, the response
time is shorter and the system is down
less often. Grundler said this can
change, however, since the number of
users continues to grow.
