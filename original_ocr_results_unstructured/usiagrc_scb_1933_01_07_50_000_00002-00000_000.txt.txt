THE THREE DAY MORATORIUM

Grinncll college is pioneering again in the tier
duration of a three day “study period.“ Tiluc
alone will tell whether this system will prove of
practical value or not, but the movement in itsell'
symbolizes the aggressiveness of the institution.
Education, after all, is motivated by the desire to
know, and the faculty takes this step because it
desires to know, to find out, the best way to edu-
Gate the students.

It is noteworthy that the faculty does not rush
into the new field headlong, but, like the true Pio-
neers. cautiously feels out the way.

They do not grant a full month, as do some ill-
stitutions, for the review period, bllt extend only
a few days. If the experiment is found to be suc-
cessful and waltronts a longer period of individual
study, it is almost a certainty that the longer time
will be given.

No one may justly claim that Grinnell is static.
It is this constant search for improved methods,
this continual striving to keep' abreast of the times
that makes one proud to call himself a student of
Grinncll.

MORE ABOUT CHAPEL

A great deal has been within these columns ill
regard to the announcement of chapel speakers ill
advance, but one is constantly confronted with new
aspects to the situation.

One argument against prconuonnccmcllt has
been that the practice would incite a new type of
“hondsaking,” another that the attendance would
vary according to the popularity of the speaker.

It appears to us students that these two evils.
if they or evils, wollld tend to counteract each
other ,and if they did not, that any college profes-
sor should be big enough not to resent a scanty ate
tendance.

There are many of us who would like to he
better acquainted with instructors with whom we
have no classroom contact. There are whole dcr
pnrtluents the individuals of which are unknown
to many, especially new students, because it is an
impossibility for the freshmen to take courses in
all departments.

They may not he in the least interested ill tllc
department the speaker teaches in, but a very large
percentage of college students are interested in
people ,and. would go out of their way to hear in-
structors from other departments if they lmcw
when they could be heard.

WANTED—A 48 HOUR DAY

Whether the chapel speaker Thursday notunlr
1y meant that a student should spend 10 or 12 hours
a day during the coming reading period on cone
ccntrated study, or whether he was merely setting
a goal toward which the student should strive is
a matter to be reckoned with.

Although the man or woman who comes to
college for nothing but study alone may accomplish
this, how can it be expected of those Grinncllians
who find it necessary to work their way through
school?

The man or woman most likely to succeed will
carry an over gc amount of work in outside ac—
tivities in addi on to his or her board job.

Allow those people with full board jobs two
hours for each meal (one hour for the work itself,
and the other for changing clothes, going to and
from work, and eating). Add to this conservative
estimate eight hours of Sleep, and only 10 are left
out of the 24!

Professors are willing to assume, then, that
students can study continuously for 10 Hours a day,
carry on their work besides, cat and sleep, and not
suffer from fatigue. It is not humanly possible to
undergo the mental strain of doing that much read-
ing, and then be in any sort of shape for the oven
stiffer week of final examinations.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SO “'11 \'1‘
(Nebraska \ lyun)

Tllc red flag of radicalism has been raised in the
. uiy south. At least charges to that effect have been
forward” 1. Was it tlliis o[ yore ond will it he in the fu-
L'll'e" Cl is it po ble that the particular situation in
which the collegiah finds himself during this particular
decade the cause?

A pithy statement on this subject has come to us
which should be passed on to you.

“We know that today's college students are not the
selected group that those of yesterday were, college
education is more general. Fewer young men and wo-
men let pass the opportunity for the puisual of a higher
education This fact needs no argument; it does not need
even the presentation of statistics for proof.

“The events which bring our stated query to the
foreground are oftcn designated “student strikes." Did
the student of yesterday who paid a comparatively high
tuition fee and re. g-netl himself to the dictation of pro-
fessors ever let the inconsistency of student rcvolt con~
sciontiously enter his mind? Did he seek to dictate the
terms of the administration to which he had given him-
self for teaching when his matriculation was completed?

“The modern student has come to a position of some
prominence by his apparent dictatorial power in the
realm of fashion He has come to be classed as a man
of little thought and less foresight. He is a man who has
developed the art of “getting by.” Ho is smooth: he is
polished. One need not have any depth behind a fine
social vencei in order to be eligible for the category of
students. The true collegian the investigator, the exr
pcrimenter, the reader, the thinkerihzs come to be the
exception. He is not easy to find, for many of his loss
studious collegiate friends know how to imitate his im»
pi-cssion upon those who seek competent workers, lead-
ers, organizers."

THE “PROJECT METHOD" OF TEACHING
(Iowa state student)

The department of psychology at the University of
Iowa has for several years used the "project method”
of teaching. According to Dean Carl E. Seashore, head of
the department, the system has proved successful,

Under the plan, the ,work of the various courses is laid
out beforehand. A list of assignments and of reference
books is given the Student, and from that “mm on he
works for himself. He studies at his own speed and does
not need to waste time on subject matter with which he
is already familiar. There is no teaching as such, but
the instructor makes criticisms and suggestions and one
swers perplexing questions. Each student is treated in-
dividually, and his peculiar problems recognized .

Regardless of its details and minor objections, the
system would seem to have several marked advantages.
In the first place, the student is placed on his own
initiative. He is placed in a position similar to the situ-
ation in later life where he will have to stimulate hm-
self to work, map out his own program, and solve his
own problems, He is treated as an adult, not a grade
School student.

Critics may reply that the average college student
is not well enough developed for such a system of teach-
ing. They may say that he must be driven to study, and
does not have the initiative to ferret out facts for him-
self. A possible answer is that present teaching meth-
ods place a premium on lack of initiative and mental
laziness. Then, too, is it worth-While to prod E studbnt
who shows no interest and resourcefulness?

Another advantage of the plan is that each student
studies at a rate determined by his own abilities and
background. He need not be slowed up by dull members
of a class. He can make use of knowledge he already
possesses and can spend more time on “pics new to him.

The project method, then, is a system designed to fit
the needs of the individual student. It is essentially a de-
parture from the present system designed to place the
imprint of scholaisbip on the masses. It would perhaps
be well to consider it in our search for better teaching
methods.

ANOTHER, RACKET
(Purdue Express)

Following on the heels of the charges that certain
school officials at the Morton high school in Cicero were
giving positions as ”corridor cops" to their political
friends, comes the news from Philadelphia of the gross
misuse of scholarships to the {our Pennsylvania. institu-
tions which receive state support: the University of
Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State college, University of
Pitmburgh, and Temple university in Philadelphia Since
19/25 each of the 50 state senators has been given the
privilege of distributing three four-year scholarships to
each of the {our Schools. The total value of the 600
scholarships amounts to $72o,ooo annually, Although it
had been predicted at the time of the passage of the
scholarship resolution that some of the scholarships
would be used for political purposes, it was not revealed
until a sort time ago the extent of this misuse.

After certain fees of the University of Pennsylvania
and Temple university had been paid in worthless checks
totaling almost $2,000, investigations were started; all
of which led to one man, Henry S, Fitch, a retired drug-
gist. When Fitch was arrested, it became apparent that
his racket was the sale of scholarships, Some of them
were genuine; the others were more promises of schol-
arships for which he had been paid in full. If he was able
to live up to his promise and deliver the scholarships,
he paid for them with worthless checks.

Investigation which followed the Fitch arrest re
vealed that certain state senators thought nothing of
swapping scholarships around so that they might help
as many of their personal friends as possible. After an
exchange between Senator Max Aaron of Philadelphia
and Senator William D. Mansfield of Pittsburgh, the
Mansfield scholarship fell into the hands of Fitch. Aaron
admitted that he had signed it and turned it over to the
office of Boss William Scott Var He. and others who
were Caught in the same position, admitted that the
practice ought to be abolished, but they did not admit
that many of their scholarships were handed over to
ward leaders in return for campaign contribution or
political patronage.

In other words, for the past seven years the state
of Pennsylvania has literally been contributing to the
welfare of its state legislators who happen to be in office
at the time. The most obvious remedy to the situation
it would seam, is to place the awarding of scholarships
on a competitive basis similar to those used for the
Naval and Military academies. The awards should be
continued but certainly not under the present system.

"The New Year is the time to take

follow is that of Paul, who recom-
