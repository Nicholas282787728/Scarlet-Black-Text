Bizarre Payne in Negative Space

The Self-proclaimed ”bizarrity“ or
Spencer Payne's artwork, now on
display in the Negative Space Gallery.
lies in the individual’s interpretation of
the artist’s anthropomorphised feel<
ings. Confusion and conquest are two
key situations in the works which lead
viewers to feel that they are experienc-
ing common emotions, through Payne,
in an uncommon way.

According to Payne. each work
demands an interpretation which
draws not (mm the artist’s ex-
periences, but from those of the viewer.

“The works can be interpreted on
radically different levels — either on an
individual level or on a larger
metaphoric level,” Payne said. “It has
a lot to do with being an individual and
with what the pressures of being an in-
dividual mean."

Payne, who has had _no formal ar-
tistic training. uses varied media and
improvisational methods to construct
works which are playlul and stretch the
imagination. The results reveal unlike—

ly associations; each representative of '

a different idea.

A public service announcement.
brought to you by the Relays Commit *
tee: Security at this year's Relays will ,

detract trom the promise oi lun, sun,

games. spectators. and trlppers. There‘,
will be one general entrance and two

must have a guest pass and prooi of '
legal age. Once identity has been conr .

existence of Relays and will be strictly ‘

this process may seem. it will not be a
big hassle as long as everyone is ‘
cooperative and tolerant. Relays will '

modifications had to be made. i
