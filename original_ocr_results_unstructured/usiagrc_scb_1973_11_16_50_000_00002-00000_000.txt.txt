problem.

Monday’s meeting of the faculty
was marked by unanimity. There
was little real debate of substance;
changes in the original calendar
proposal were of a mechanical na-
ture designed to cut down on dis-
ruptions.

Besides problems posed for ath»
letic teams, entertainment events
appeared to be the most seriously
affected part of the College struc-
ture.

Although she had not yet had time
to assess the problem fully, Geor—
gia Dentel, activities counsellor
said early in the week that at least
one entertainment event already
contracted would be affected by the
two week extension of the winter
break.

Student ACM

by John annbuli and Robin Recant

CEDAR RAPIDS, lA-~Last week-
end Grinnell College was one of
eleven ACM schools to collaborate
in writing a resolution urging the
impeachment of President Nixon.

The first ACM student conference
in six years was sponsored under
the auspices of the Coe College
student government.

Kim Benjamin, president of that
organization, moderated the day and
a half long series of meetings last
weekend. Student delegates to the
conference were primarily student
body presidents, representing all
colleges in the ACM except for
Knox and Beloit.

Grinnell's participation in the con-
ference came in the form of Scott
Weil as SGA president, Robin Re-
cant as a representative of the
Grinnell Committee to Impeach the
President, and John Turnbnll as
scribe.

The Grinnellians were actively in-
volved in the formulation of the
"impeachment statement” that was
the focal point of the conference.
After a heated discussion of some
six hours, the delegates present
finally agreed upon the following
wording:

“We realize that the United States
Congress has only once before re-
sorted to impeaching its president.
While it would not be appropriate
to impeach Mr. Nixon solely [or
the purpose or removing an unpop-
ular president from office, we, the

undersigned representatives of the
student government of the Associa-
ted Colleges of the Midwest, hereby

call for the impeachment of Pres—
ident Richard M. Nixon and, if pro-

ven guilty of high crimes and mis-
demeanors, his conviction and re-
moval from office. Quite apart from

Elsewhere

Effects of the fuel crisis were
apparently less severe in other
parts of Iowa and the Midwest, The
Associated Press reported Monday
that Grinnell was the first academ-
ic institution in Iowa to alter its
calendar due to the energy crisis.

Spot checks by college officials
of other ACM schools showed no
immediate serious concern about
energy.

Coe College in Cedar Rapids re-
ceives its heat through the city st—
eam system, and thus has no en—
ergy problem.

Cornell College in Mount Vernon,
and Carleton and Saint OlafColleges
in Northfield, MN all expressedonly
mild concern at present.

Knox College in Galeshurg, IL eXr
pressed some concern about the en»
ergy problem, but had formulated
no plans at the time officials there
were contacted.

can the confidence in our national
government be restored.”

This statement was signed “like
the Declaration of Independence"
by head representatives of each
college scrawling his/her John Han-
cock on the paper. Each signee
then took the statement to his/her
respective school to get as wide
an endorsement of it as possible.
Each school also was encouraged
to have letter writing campaigns
and back political candidates fa—
voring the removal of Nixon from
office.

in addition to passing the impeach-
ment statement, each student go-
vernment leader presented a general
picture of student involvement in
the workings of their school and a
view of their college’s social life
and regulations.

At the end of the conference. Ben—
jamin said, ”I believe that this meet-
ing has caused u S to realize the
potential for cooperation among the
students of the ACM colleges.”
Hope for similar meetings in the
near iuture was expressed as the
conference ended.

Absenteeism Hits SGA Meeting

by John Turnbull

Absent: Mears, Main, James, Read,
Loose (l), Dibble, Cowles, Gates.
Rawson, Younkers (l) and all of
the SGA Cabinet except Ellen Yack—
nin.

As can be surmised, absentia pre»
vented any major decisions at Wed»
nesday night’s meeting of the Joint
Boards. Those attending weretreat-
ed to a series of informative re-
ports.

Marlene Frantz reported that she
and Lenny Kurz felt a new inves-
tigative position for handling priv—
ate complaints unpursuable by the
Office of Community Rights.

Regarding KDIC. recent negotia-
tions with Associated Press have
enabled the station to cutits weekly
teletype bill by about a half. bee
cause of technicalities hawever,this
will not be retroactive. Thus, the
station will still need $700 to come
plete the year. No one knows just
where to get the money and a poss-
ibility exists of closing the station
before long.

One more informative note: The
Saga fast has been moved to evening
meal of Friday, November 30. The
delay is a result of last—minute
negotiations raising the reimbure
sement rate from 55¢ toaronndssc.

Grinne” Finds New Concert Hall

by Tlsbn Bauer

A new idea in entertainment, the
Squash Court Concert, will be pre-
sented at 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. Friday
and Saturday November 23 and 24.
Sponsored by the Music andTheatre
departments, the multi»media pro,
gram will include electronic music,
dance movements, and mime in an
effort to explore the accoustical
advantages and theatrical intimacy
ofa squash court.

According to Mrs. Eetty Voertman,
director of dance, one of the main
objectives of the show is to try and
overcome the distance that exists

in larger theaters. “The squash
court was chosen because it is a
very live, theatrical place” Voert~
man explained.

“For the audience there’s no way
not to be involved since they will
be close to each other as well as
the performers.” She added that
another advantage to being so close
is “one can really see the physical
effort involved. "

Both details and design will be
equally apparent as the audience
watches one majordance movement,
”Frieze," two small dances, anda
mime segment.

Broo ings Economist Urges 'Sociul

by Fred Horecxy

Alice Rivlin, an economist and
senior fellow of the Brookings In~
stitution in Washington, D.C., met
with students and faculty here last
Monday and Tuesday, November 12
and 13.

In an afternoon presentation Mon-
day in the South Lounge, Rivlin
urged that the federal government
pursue a policy of "social experie
mentation." She defined ”socialex-
perimentation” as “trying out go-
vernmental social policies in an
experimental way.”

Since the late 1960’s, the federal
government has embarked upon a
number of social experiments de-
signed to alleviate poverty. As an
example, Rivlin discussed the New
Jersey Income Maintenance Experi-
ment, a negative income tax pro
gram designed to grantaguaranteed
income level to poor iamllies in
selected areas. Income levels a-
round 52,000 were experimented

with. Riviin suggestedthatafeasible
national income maintenance pro-

gram could be developed out of the
New Jersey plan.

Experimentation has also been
done by the government in theareas
of housing allowances for the poor,
health insurance, and ”contract"
education. Although Rivlin said She
felt that these experiments had pro-
duced useful results, “we have le»

arned that it is harder to experim-
ent than we thought.” Social experi-
mentation by theiederalgovernment
faces a moral dilemma-ﬂhow do
you protect the privacy of indivie
duals” as you attempt to improve
their lives?

Eiviin predicted that the Nixon
Administration would ressurect so-
me form of the now defunct Fam»

ily Assistance Plan. The welfare
reform issue has always been su-

rrounded by a great deal of poli-
tical controversy.

In an evening lecture, she dis—
cussed “Congress andNatiDnalPrir
orities.” She argued that the fed,
eral government must improve the

Progressive Dinner Proposed

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Bob Jacobs has proposed a novel
method of dealing with what he
describes as ”the lack of student~
faculty social contact on this camv
pus."

In a letter to all faculty and ad-
ministrators dated November 8, Ja-
cobs proposed a three stage re—
volving dinner. in which each par-

ticipating faculty member or ad-
ministrator would host three dif-
ferent groups of six students --
one for cocktails/hers d’oeuvres,
a second for dinner, and a third
for dessert,

Students would be allowed to ch-
eck out their Saga steaks to min-
lmlze the cost to those particip-
ating.

Later in the evenings, students
would reciprocate by hosting a par
ty for faculty and administration.

Jacobs said Thursday that res-
ponse from administrators hasbeen

good, but that faculty responsetothe
idea is "not too potent.”

Jacobs is enthusiastic about the
idea, and says that students who
have heard about the plan also
appear excited,

He still hopes to organize the
two stage ”party” sometime in
February, and says he needs af-
firmative answers from interested
faculty and administrators no later
than November 24,

cited about “the unusualaccoustical
environment.”

Highlights to watchfor area ”mys-
terious blob," projections of sound-

planning of the national budget. Par-
ticularly, Congress must reassert
its role in the budgetary process
by examining the budget as a whole
for the fiscal year. Rivlin’s pro-
posal would require the president
to submit the budget a year early.

Budgetary planning would improve
the current process of “niuddling
through.” Opposition to budgetary
planning has comefrom liberals who
are afraid that explicit policy
Choices would reveal their liberal
tendencies to more conservative
constituencies in their home states.
On Tuesday morning, Rivlin dis-
cussed the problems of a woman as
an economist with students in Bre-
nner’s “Women intheLaborForce"
class, She cited several instances
of discrimination that she has faced,
but she generally believed that
“things are getting better,"

Rivlin was somewhat anxious to
get back to Washington, as she is
now involved in making budgetary
proposals to Congress.
