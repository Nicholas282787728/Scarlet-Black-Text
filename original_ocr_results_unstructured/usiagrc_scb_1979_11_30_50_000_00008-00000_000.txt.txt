Getting a lift with heavy

weight training iacilities at Grinhell
are “despicable." The Universal Gym,
located In the small, unventilated
room adjacent to the men's locker
room. is over ten years old. The
machine is on its last lap, if it is not
broken. it is being repaired

The main concern. however, is not
the Universal, but the lack of an ape
propriatc ireerweiglit set up, Coaches
and allileles stress the importance of
a rreeweight system because such
machines as the Universal create an
imbalanced development. The Unlver»
sat. by nature oi its design, helps
stronger muscles become stronger,
while the weaker muscles become pro»
portionaiely weaker.

In the GORI’ room, located at the
southernmost entrance oi the PEC,
lies a scattering or tree-weights It is
approxrmatcd, however, that 99% or
these weights are owned by Mark
Fraiikle and Tom Briles, both of
whom are students, Many athletes
fear the time when either Briles or
Frankie graduate because there will
no longer be any Ireerweiglits at Grin»
nell. As such, there is an active in-
terest among certain athletes to push
the administration to buy weights.
