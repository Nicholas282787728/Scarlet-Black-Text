Postpone upcomnig SGA election by one week

Another round of elections is cur
rently scheduled for Monday. this time
giving us the opportunity to pick the
president and (for the first time) a pair
ofvicc presidents to represent our fine
snrdenr body, Hopefully this won't hapr
penttwe call on SGA to postpone the
electrons by one week.

if you had wanted to run for presi—
dent or vice president, the deadline for
your application would have been yes-
terday at five (originally Wednesday at
eight). This would have left you three
days and seven hours to get out to talk
to students around campus, answer
questions, shake hands and maybe even
kiss a few babies. But most students’
time on weekends will be taken up by
decidedly nontpoliticalacti ties,not to
mention the homework load. It is clear
that this window of time for campaign-
ing is not nearly enough to really learn
about our potential fearless loaders.

There is an open forum on Sunday

at 8:00 pm. for- all students to attend
(if the storm doesn't cancel it), but this
is the only organized event bringing
all the candidates together. Ifyorr cm,
not attend this

event, you
left to glean
knowledge off
of loggia posters
and Blackboard/
bathroom stall
statements of
intent, In the end, when we click that
“send" sometime on Monday, our vote
is likely to be a result ofwlral we knew
about the candidate prior to that threat
day whirlwind “campaign”, if we knew
anything at all,

This leaves SGA elections, senato—
rial elections included, not much better
than the high school popularity contests
we hoped we had left hernd. Students
are disillusioned with SGA enough as
it is. Even with Joint Board minutes c-

are

mailed out every week, most students
would rather talk about the rhetoric of
the Senate Judiciary Committee rather
than the rhetoric of the distinguished
senator from East
campus.

tf SGA sets up a
more lengthy came
paign trail, every
one would benefit, It
would provrde us wrrh
inoie opportunities to
ask the candidates questions, as well as
the ability to set up more meet—ands
green and debates It would give the
candidates the time to go around and
actually talk to students about their pet
sitions, even if they are on issues like
lounge reservations and the blank hall-
waywalls in the second and third floors
ofthc JRC.

Postponing elections a week cret
ates time for at least two debates, one
for the presidency and one for the vice

presidency, and students wrll have more
time to make an informed decision on
Election Day. Voting for initiatives is
also scheduled for Monday, bilt SGA
can push those back if they are core
ceined that students won‘t vote in mul-
tiple elections.

Brit that's just a shorrttetm ﬁx. We
urge ]0lrlt Board and SGA to pass a
Constitutional Amendment l‘cquirt
ing the declaration of candrdaeies two
weeks prior to elections and one inan-
datory debate for each position. This
way, candidates will begin campaigning
with enough time to get their message
across to the whole student body. And
students will ﬁnally know for whom
they are voting.

The Harris hookup: One woman’s advice

An awkward hookup is not unlike the Oreo pie
at the dining hall. It seems like a great idea at the
time, but you will undoubtedly hate yourself for it
two hours later. And even though it's never good,
back you go to the dessert bar like a jilred lover cw
cry week. “Maybe it'll be okay thrs time!" you think.
“NIaybc it was actually delicious last time, and I just
forgotl" Hookups work the same way: even though
you know, deep down in your heart, that the guy
from your philosophy class is obnoxious, racist and
has a wicked scar spanning half his face, he's hard
to resist under the seductive Harris lighting. Now,
1 can't stop you from making these poor life choices
7 let's be honest, I plan my weekends around them
7 butl can give you some advice.

To begin wrth, Harris is not the place for great
romance. You might walk
in through those mirrored
double doors drinking,
“Maybe this night will
end with a romantic dance
under thc stars!", but you
will walk out vomiting on 'i
the shoes of someone you
don’t even know,

Because of this, it’s important to set your stunt
dards low.“What”’you exclainr.“I would never settle
for someone who wasn't good enough for me!" You
say that now, but frve minutes into Underwear Ball,
when you're regretting your cheap WaltMart panry
set, that hairy guy from psych will be looking pretty
damn good. Set that bar close to the ground, and you
can never be disappointed.

Keep in mind, however, that there's a difference
between setting the bar low’ and ‘burying the bar
seventeen feet into the ground'There comes a time
when people have to step up and make their own den
cisions m but that time is not Harris. You might think
your dance partner is pretty hot, but if your friends
are rnak‘rng“0h my God, get away from him, he has

bodies under his ﬂoorboards" motions to you in the
background, as probably a bad idea. My friend has
a rule that has helped me through many hooktup
situations: don’t sleep with anyone you wouldn’t want
to be. Sex change procedures aside, it's a useful ques-
tion. lfyou can't imagine spending the rest or your
lrfe as someone who wears tapered jeans and listens
to Evanescence, maybe you don't want to share your
bed with him or her either.

If your potential hook-up meets these standards,
it might be time to consider going home with him or
her. Sure, this may seem a little speedy, but gone are
the days of courting and roses. We are living in the
age of hooking up with complete strangers and pray
ing that you don’t vomit on them,and boy, is it sweet.
lfyou'r-c planning on asking someone to spend the
night with you, it's impor-
tant to do it before Harris
ends.

Have you ever noticed
how, when the last Harris
song ends and the bright,
unforgivrng fluorescent
lights come tip, everyone
looks at their dance partner and sort of clinges?
Yeah, it's not pleasant. To maintain the image of
mysterious allure, you should book it while it's still
dark inside.

I’ve always thought that the most awkward in—
gredient of the Harris hookup rocrpo is the long
walk home. it's cold outside, you're sobering up, and
away from the seductive Disco lighting, this hookup
choice is starting to look more and more like your
great-aunt Millie. Because you can’t break the tent
sion by dancing, you're left to chat awkwardly and
wonder if this is actually the same person you were
with inside. “Docs he always walk like that)" you
think. “Did he actually brrng a backpack to Harris?
And oh my God, how far away is thrs room' we're
going to?”

once you've reached his or her room — and eyed
the decaying flowers and litersize Madonna posters
nervously 7 it's time to get down to busrness, Hone
estly, the most important advice I can give you con,
cerning a hookup is tojust laugh about it.

Let's face it: you're awkward. we all are. Un-
doubtedly, you will trip over your jeans as you remove
them, stab your partner in the eye with your foot or
discover that he or she is not the sex you originally
thought. And if you can’t laugh about those things,
you’ll just have to sit awkwardly on the edge of the
bed, making up an excuse about having an eight a.m.
class on Sunday morning. It's so much better ifyou
can just acknowledge that you sound like a pterod'tht
tyl, laugh together and move on.

Unfortunately, your sweet, sweet time together
will ultimately end, and you’ll be faced with either
kicking your partner out of your room at three u.m.
or trying to fit two people into a catrsizcd dorm bed.
As everyone knows, the aftermath of a hookup is
usually the worst part. After you’ve collected your
Clothingihow did that bra get all the way over
there? ialrd said some hurried goodbyes,you would
think you could move on.

But no. Even ifyon never saw this person around
campus before, they will suddenly be everywhere:
in your classes, on your bcsr friend’s ﬂoor, eyeing
you nervously from across the Grill. You'll try to
make conversation, but the only thing you'll both be
thinking is, “OH MY GOD I HAVE SEEN YOU
NAKED AND IT WAS NOT NECESSARILY
PLEASANT."

I wish I could tell you what to do in this situ-
ation, but I don't know myself. My first instinct is
always to ﬂee, but maybe it would be better to stop,
acknowledge each other brieﬂy and then move on.
No hard feelings or fears ofcomrnitment, just a smile
and a runny, slightly awkward memory—and there’s
nothing wrong with that.
