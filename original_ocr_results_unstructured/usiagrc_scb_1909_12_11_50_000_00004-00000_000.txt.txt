Wheu asked for her opinion about
Netball one of the Junior girls said:
“I believe that Grinnell would lose
nothing by eliminating football from
the list a! college atllletlcs. It. certainr

work on the part at the players, for
the game is an all—absorbing occupa.‘

“One point that I am never afraid of

general suggestions, “is the value of
absolute precision and accuracy in thot

is decidedly one or the acquired ones,
