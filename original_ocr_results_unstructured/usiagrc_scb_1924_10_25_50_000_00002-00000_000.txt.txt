MORE ABOUT THE WOMEN

Without societieswwhztt Udall?

The cynical souls who reiuse to
place their faith in human nature, par-
ticularly in feminine human nature,
predict the sneaking, insidious arrival
or secret sororities as soon as the lit-
erary society is driven from the cam-
pus.

As a means or intellectual expres

sion, as a cultural influence in the life
of Grinnoil, as a young ladies’ finish-
ing school where Grinnell cored: may

doubtedly leave a great yawning gap
in the life or the Quadrangle.

“’e’re inclined to wonder, however,
whether the secret sorority, with its
password and its hlah-blaheblhh, and
all its rapid, inane childishncss, can
,rill that gap; and whether the girls
who make up the four literary societies
today could even “kid themselves" in-
to genuine enjoyment of such an or:
ganizotion,

Grinnell staged a scrimmage against
a secret sorority or two within the
memory or our own college gmera‘
tion, and came out on top Literary
societies at the time were stronger
than they are now, and we are led to
the conclusion that their presence or
absence has nothing to do with the
passing vogue or secret, meaningless
conclaves.

The girls who were responsible for
that three year old smudge on the

pages of Grinnell history are no long-
er in school. Some day, in the changa
ing, shitting personnel of the Quad

it is sometimes asserted, as the sav-

younger girls find in it their one 01)—
portllnity to really know the girls at
the upper classes Theoretically,
that's always true; too often, however,

things don't Work out that way,

the world go round, But we stick to
the conviction that a Friday afternoon
rushing party, where every hostess is
a “rusher,” and every guest a "rushc
ee," isn’t an eih‘ciently managed tace
tory for true friendships. Nothing but
a miracle could make it so.

When the rushing season ends and
the sophomore rushee hccomcs a soph—
omore society girl, there's usually a
breathing spell . . then it's
to begin work on the freshmen, and

If there's an upper class girl you’ve
always thought you’d like to know,
wouldn’t it be nicer to meet her at a
party where you could each be you're
soil, where there were no \stiltlng rec
straints, no drtificiality? Where you
could tails to -her, laugh with her,
dance with her, with no thought at
rushing or being rushed?

“We can never see the sunrise by
looking into the west." So we can
not solve society problems by heating
around thc bush.
and taco the problem tairly and
squarely, it is a thing that must
be talked over frankly.

Societies cause more heart-aches
than any one other thing in Grinnell.
First, there are the girls that don't
make societies. They reel that they
are not liked by the rest or the girls.
They tool that something is vitally
wrong with themselves.

Then secondly there are the girls
that make societies, What a dis-
illusinnrncnt is it to find what societr
ics really are: My freshman year a
junior girl told me that societies mean
more to the people outside, than they
do to the people in them. I did not
understand what she meant. Hei-
statement is quite clear to mo now,
The little enjoyment that the society
girls got out or their meetings is
lgreatly outweighed hy the heart-aches
.ot girls that don't make a society.
Grinncll is supposed to he a demo-
cratic school, Is it democracy in the
lhighest sense for forty or titty girls
to exclude the rest at the school from
their social life? I do not helievc it
is.
