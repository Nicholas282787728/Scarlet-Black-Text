0 Why Hear Potter?

Every new development brings home more
forcibly, day after day, the undeniable rcah
ization that after all this is fundamentally
our war. We can argue until our tongmes
turn blue about how innocent we are, how
wewthe winsome ilrloetwcell generationwdid
nothing to generate tlle rabid onslaught of
violence now turned loose upon the world,
how we were not responsible for the ideal-
ism gone haywire, that twisted the outcome
of the last World War. Nevertheless the
simple incontestable fact remains that we
are the ones who are and will be called upon
to do the dirty work in this war.

It‘s really no laughing matter, this under‘
taking: to know that upon us depends not
only the immediate outcome of the fighting
and the internal carrying on, but the whole
future destiny of world civilization after-
wards. It is a serious reflection to realize
that in the times immediately ahead it will
not be some sympathetic leader calling out
directions from the sidelines to urge us on,
but we ourselves who will be out there
making the decisions.

Now is the time when we can be prepar-
ing for that day. That is why the presence
on our campus of such a competent guide
on international and political affairs as Pit-
man Potter offers Gl‘innell students a pe-
culiar challenge. In the next few weeks we
will have an unusual opportunity to be di-

recting our thinking and our planning along
lines of the causes, conduct, outcome, and
possible prevention of wars. Who knous
when we will be called upon to make use
of the reservoir of ideas we are now build-
ing up for the future construction of a more

.Defense Training.

Since December 7, Grinnell, with hundreds
of other American educational institutions,
has embarked on an extensive program oi
academic revision for the war emergency.
Courses have been added, recreational fa—
cilities adapted, and special war projects be
gun. With over two months of work put
into this revamping process, it may be time
to survey the progress, and ask “Just what,
if anything, is our college war effort ac-
complishing7”

Seventy-two college editors were asked
that question recently by the staff of the
Daily Maroon, University of Chicago paper,
in a telegraphic poll. Concentrating on the
ef ct of the college changes on students of
military age, the poll finds that the average
male undergraduate is “badly prepared for
his life in the armed forces, and that Amer-
ican educational institutions are giving no
evidence that he will be any better prepar-
ed in the near future."

Reporting that 74 llew ”defense courses”
have been added in the '72 schools polled,
the Maroon study te‘ms these “defense
courses” as “counte itants established
by college administrations unable to secure
actual military training courses under the
supervision of the army. Existing ROTC
units in American colleges have had a tre-
mendous surge in enrollment, but the War
Department has announced no new units
will be established Non-ROTC schools have
atempted to fill in'this gap by a mushroom—
ing growth of “special courses.” The Ma-
roon poll points out the effect of countel-
irritant defense courses is beginning to wear
off. Interest in conditioning classes at sev—
eral colleges has lagged so much that an-
thorities hare introduced close order drill
and bayonet movements to vitalize them.

Listing scores of special defense courses—
from “Newspaper Chinese” to “Morale Psy—
chology”—being offered 'American students,
editors of the Maroon point out that such
study is worthless to the potential soldier.
First, non—ROTC schools have overlooked
the fact that specialized training is of no
value to a prospective fighting man unless
accompanied by basic military training. Sec-
ond, both ROTC and non»ROTC schools
have overlooked that they are giving spe~
cialized subjects without any assurance that
the training they are giving meets with 01"
can be used in Army conditions.

go into the hands of the United
States and Britain. who must
serve as leaders, not imperialists
