.by Paul Friend

As the son of one of the
finest athletes produced at the
University of lawn, Gardiner
Dutton has had much to live up to,
and the flaming red head has
come through with flying colors.

Dut declared, “I owe much of
my athletic success to my father
who gave me my start, but
women have interfered with my
development.”

Gardinel"s dad was captain of
the baskethall and track teams
at Iowa. He not only coached
his son when But was young,
but placed in him the fiery Duts
ton desire to win.

But trained furiously at Mo
Kinley high school in Cedar
_Rapids. He never went to bed
later than 9:30. His work paid
off as he won four track and
tthree haskethall letters for his
,beloved “Guide Bears.”

Among his accomplishments

low hurdler. As can be seen,
Gardiner could pick up some
vital points for the Pioneer
cindermen at the conference
meet next weekend.

Basketball coach John Pfitsch
said, “Gardiner is one of the
most conscientious players I’ve
ever coached." but was disap-
pointed with his hasketball play»
‘ing this year, and he hopes to
reestablish himself as a top
flight hoop star next season.

, The red head claims that be-
‘mg with a great bunch of guys
is his greatest reason for loving
sports. He also gets much per-
sonal satisfaction from seeing his
work pay off.

No one meets the blushing red
‘and forgets him. Likeable, spirit
ed Gardiner Dutton has worked
for what he has achieved to
continue the line of fine athletes
in his family.
