Sideline Speculations and

Intramural

By Jean meter and Twyllali
Hamstreet

with six games crowded into
lost week-end, the basketball luv
ti'dmural was ended. Friday night,
H'l a close game, James defeated
Mears 15-14. Haines and Main
played a rough and tumble game
resulting in a 23718 Haines vic-
tory. We believe the Cleveland-
Read game to be one of the best
of the tournament because of
its clean, smooth playing on the
part of both teams. Read defeat-
ed Cleveland. 26-17.

Saturday aftemoo Read
ciiiched the championship by de»
foating James 21-12, and’l—loines
pulled into second place by nos-
ing out Cleveland 27-25 in a
tight game. The MearSrMaln
game ended in a 30-6 victory for
Meal-s.

The champion Read team con-
sistently showed superiority in
guarding, in ball-handling, and
test.- but not least, in shooting.
Close integration of their defense
and offense resulted in all around
sinccth basketball.

This round-robin type of infra.
mural is organized so that each
team plays every other team. For
each victory two points are giv-
eu; for each tie. one poin . and
on credit is awarded for a loss.
Following this system, the re-
sults of the tournament were:
