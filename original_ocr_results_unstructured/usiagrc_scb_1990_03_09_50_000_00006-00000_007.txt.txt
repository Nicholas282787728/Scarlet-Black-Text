Vice-Presidential Interviews

 

March 9, 1990

What do you believe makes you
the best qualiﬁed candidate for
SGA vice-president?

Ibelieve thatl’mthemost qualified
candidate for SGA Vice»prcsident
because if I'm elected to the posi‘
tion, I bring experienced leadership.
I've had experience working with
Lheadministrnlion,working withthe
faculty, representing the student
body and their concerns. I have
worked with a diverse set of issues,
and I have proven myselfas an effl-
cient,vcry wcll-qualifredcandidate.

What do you foresee as the most
impurtantissues facingSGA,and
what changes would you initiate
for SGA?

The purpose ofSGA is to represent
student concerns. This year there
have been student concerns directed
toward creating diversity on came
pus. in all aspects ofthe word and in
all aspects of the college. i think
that’s one thing that I‘ve prioritized
in my experience this year at Grin»
ncll; l have a genuine concern for
promoting diversity. Diversity can
be led hv multicultural issues. gay/
lesbian/bisexual issues, and the dif-
ferent levels of college curriculum,
extracurricular programs.dorm life;
Icoultlgoonand on. I’vcprioritizcd
diversity since I came to Grinnell.

. That's something that‘s very impor-
tant to me, and I will continue to do
that. If elected as vice-president. I
would be working through the cur-
ricular aspects of creating diversity
with the administration, the faculty.
and the SEPCs.

What have you contributed to the
campus, and how do you feel you
have represented student inter~
est; in that contribution?

With my participation on Presi—

Koa Cites Past Cabinet
As Important Inﬂuence

dent Drake's Task Force on the
Future committee. one of the rear
sons why I was appointed as a stu—
dent representative was because of
my capabilities to represent the stu-
dents‘ conccms. On that commit-
tee,oncoftheconcemsthathrought
up was promoting diversity through
the faculty and the student body. I
also brought up increasing the li-
brary's resources and increasing the
faculty size. The reason why these
were some of my proposals to the
committee was because that was the
inputthatl gotfrom students. In the

 

proposals that I made (increasing
diversitydiroughoutthcsludcnisnnd
the faculty), clear efforts have been
made towards those goals. In the
past three years, faculty size has
increased by approximately 15 1/2
faculty members. Efforts are also
being made towards increasing li
brary resources,

with that involvement, I felt like
I represented student concerns well
because I actively found out what
student concerns werc. That was a
year ago. and I think that with an-
other year of experience under my
belt and with all the other experi-
ences I've had with other groups in
the past year, I can even better rep-
resent the student concerns.

What havebeenyourgreatestcon-
tributions to SGA?

This year I have added a diverse
perspective. IthinkthatI've worked
efficiently. and I’ve worked well
with fellow students. I've brought
genuine concern to my cabinet posi-
tion,and most importantly, I‘ve been

very devoted to my position. Once
I committed myself to my cabinet
position Ihis year,l followed through.

How will your so». experience
enable you to better deal with the
administration?

Through my SGA experience,
I've learned the administration’s
bureaucracy—who you have to talk
to to get a specific task done. I have

a greater understanding of exactly
what it is that each administrator
docs. I’ve worked with each ofthe
top administrators on different lev-
els. Since I already basically know
howthesystem works,lwon‘thavc
to go through thatprocess next year
ifI’m elected.

Because of your involvement in
other activities. how do you plan
to manage these time commit-
mentsulongwiththedutiesoI‘SGA
vice-president?

This year I spend about 12 hours
a week working with SOA, and I‘ve
been able to maintain involvement
in other activities. As Vicerpresir
dcnt,Ican’tgucsscxactly how many
hoursitwill take. butlcan anticipate
howmuch more workitwill rcqutrc.

tam committing myselfto thattime.
and I’m ready to sacrifice other
activities in order to belhe best vice
president thatI can be. I can say for
sure thatl'll still be an active mem-
ber of ASIA, although I don‘t think
that I'll be able to commit myself
administratively in the club. Also.
I’ll still be an active member of the
multicultural coalition, but I will
realize that my main commitment

Because ofyourinvoivementwith
the football team and your lack of
SGA experience, how will your time
commitment affect your ability to
learn and perform the duties ofSGA
president?

To be blunt, I don’t think my
participation in a fall sport will af-
fect my ability to perform my duties
as presidentatall. I‘m willing to put
in as much time as necessary to be a
good president. I think this concem
is totally unjustified. Football Lakes
roughly two to two and a half hours
a day.

As lpointed out in my statement
ofinlcnt, I will be finished with my
major this year, I’ll only be taking
three classes first semester, none of
which will he upper»leve1 econ

courses. I think that my uack record
speaks for itself. This year I took
four classes first semester, two of
which were upper-level econ
courses. I was a hall activities coor-
dinator. I was on the SEPC, plus
football, and I think I handled that
pretty well. Ithink that if you calcu-
lated the amount of time that four
classes and their respective home»
work lakcup,Iwould say thatwould
be equal to three classes and a sport.
So [don’t seeparticipating in a sport
beingaproblem. Andifyou wantto
look at past experiences, I can say
that last year's president was par-
ticipating in a fall sport. I can hon-
estly say that I don't think my par
ticipation in a fall sport will hinder
my abilities to participate in SGA.
To address the question of expe-
rience. I don't think I need to sit

through X amount of joint board
meetings to know how to deal with
people. which is what the president
does. The presidenthastobeablcto
interact with people. to get their
concerns brought to the right
people, and to handle the arrange—
ments necessary to get these con-
cerns takencareof. Ifeel thatbeing
on studentstaff has been a much
greater experience than could be
offered being hidden 2 way in an
office in the basementofthc Forum

feel that the lack of SGA
experience at mis point is that
cruciall feel that Ihcexpcrlcnce
I have gained In my other inter-
ests such as HAC. SA. elc., could
prepare me as wcll,if not better, to
represent the concerns of the stil-
dents.

 

Bucks Claims sincerity

What do you believe makes you
the best candidate for SGA vice-
president/president of academic
affairs?

To tell you the truth, I'm not
convinced that I’m the best candi-
date. I think I might be the best
candidate available, because none
oflhe members oftheRed HotChili
Peppers are even enrolled in this
school. 501 think that I’m the best
alternative.

 

What do you foresee as the most
important issues facing SGA and
what changes would you initiate
for SGA?

I think SGA itself, I think the
biggest problems that they've got, is
that they have to deal with, I mean,
all the members of Joint Board.

‘ especially. have todeal with the fact

thatfive yearsdowntheline, they’re
going to he laughed at. Ithink
they'll all have to deal with that
constructively. And. sometimes
there aren’tenough chairs at Joint
Board meetings and, also, there
hasn't been any good live music at
JointBoard meetingsforalongtime.

What have you contributed tothe
campus,and howdo you feel that
you have represented student
interests in that contribution?

I haven’t set anything big on
ﬁre. I‘ve had favorable contact
with the police in town.

You know that toaster in the
dining hall that just doesn't work.
We took it one time. AndI think
that rmlly represented student inter-
ests. because if you put a bagel in
there, it will sometimes least one
side and burn the other, and not give
it to you.

Then another time, we took
that"Cel'vene Striped" wall hang-
ing from Cowles. I think that
deﬁnitely reﬂected the interests of
the student body asa whole because
the thing isjust so dam butt-ugly.

What has SGA lacked that you
can provide?

I can provide deﬁnite Compatibil-
ity with bureaucracy, because Ijust
live for thatsort of stuff. I was born
and hrcdto deal withbureauracy.

I can plant Dogwood trees
really well, I can unload ﬂatbed
trucks full of giavel. I do apretty
good job of that: I spent all summer
doing that. Idon’tgetcarsickeasily.
and, the thing about bureaucracy,
that’s key, becauseI do that. loan
cope. tknow who to talk to and I‘ll
do it and see that itgets done. That‘s
what I see as my strong point.

Your statement of intent gives
theimpressionthatyou’renottak-

ing the responsibilities of SGA
vice-president’president of aca-
demic atTairsvery seriously. How
can you convince the campus that
you are serious about the posi-
tion?

All of them are invited home
with me over Spring Break to see
how I operate.

I think anyone who lived in
Dibble Hall last year knows me as
their secondsemester senator and
realizes the amount of lime and
thoughtI put into the SGA minutes.
In fact,1 look them so seriously and
I think I did such a good job with
them that they really became quite
a good thing. lwrote these minutes
and peoplewere taking them home
to show their parents. People were
requesting thatl do minutes for their
domi. instead of doing them them—
selves. At the end of the year. I
ended up printing copies of all my
minutes for the entire semester. I
took my duties in SGA as a senator
very seriously. I‘m just rarin‘ to go
for a shot at the vice-presidency.

As far as Iknow,I‘mthe only
candidate to come forward and vole
untecr to submit to dnig-testing.
becausel think the students have a
right to know what they're getting
into. How can I convince the cam-
pus community that I‘m serious.
Heck, I'd bewilling to submit to
all sons of drug-testing any time.
While in office, at this time. during
dinner. whenever, I‘m telling you.
Integrity It‘s not my middle name,
but it’s a watchword.

With no experience working with
the administration, how do you
intend to representsludent inter-
ests in academic issues?

I wouldn’t say that I have no
priorexperienee in dealing with the
administration. Indirectly. Iean’t
be helped but be inﬂuenced every
day. I live in Norris. and my room
overlooks Drake Plaza. I've got to
admit it's always intrigued me to
know more about the man behind
the courtyard. And I've been to
Nollen House before, on many oc-
casions.

How do] intend to represent
the students though? Everyonewill
tell you that they‘re open and are
easy to talk to, and people can come
to them with suggestions. Well,
hey. I’m more open than everyone
else. I'm very open, Shucks, I'm so
goshdam open. it's incredible. Very
open to suggestions, and I respond
to that sort of thing just because I
have no opinions of my own.

I see myself as handling the
dealing with the administration quite
adequately. Like luncheon meet-
ings. I know how to use good table
manners. I think that they'll
respect that And I think students
will come to me and talk to mc,just
because I’m that kind of guy—that
kind of personal guess.
