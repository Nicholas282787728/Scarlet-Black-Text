Dome installation
completed

by Ken Scohon

The Gale Observatory located on the
norm edge of the Grlnnell College con-
tinues to move ahead as workers placed
the dome on the structure Aug. 31 Addi-
tional interior work will delay the obser-
vatory opening, though VicePresident
Waldo Walker said it would be open to
students as soon as possible, The obsers
vatory is slated for completion late in the
semester. The college hopes to receive the
new telescope in November,

The observatory was named in honor of
Grant 0. Gale, Professor Emeritus of
physics and curator oi the physics
historical museum. The $350,000 obserr
vatory has been funded through a grant
from the Pew Memorial Trust and gifts
from alumnus and former students of
Gale,

The Gale Observatory will house a
reflecting telescope with a 24inch mirror
used in the old observatory Robert Cads
mus, assistant professor oi Physics said
the larger mirror will boost the light
gathering capacity oi the new telescope.
The new telescope will have nine times the
light gathering power of the old one

The new telescope’s mounting will
employ two computers that are designed
to quickly locate stars in the night sky

Cadmus said the computer‘s state of the
art software was written for use in a larger
observatory in Chile, and a third computer
will be available for data acquisition and
analysis. Some programs for this com
puter were written here at the college this
summer, Cadmus said once the obser-
vatory is complete, these programs will
give the college a quality research system
comparable to any other in the state.

Although there are no current plans to
expand the number of astronomy courses
at Grinnell, the new telescope and its com-
puters will be used for various independent
projects. One such project currently
underway involves measuring the
diameters of stars by using an occulation
technique when a star is eclipsed by the
moon. Projects for the future include a
study or the ages of star clusters by
measuring the temperature and
brightness oi member stars.

Before construction began, there was
some debate as to whether the observatory
should be placed farther away irom the
campus in the Bio Preserve in order to
avoid Grinnell‘s light pollution. The obsers
vatory’s current location was settled upon
so that its facilities wouldrbe more accessis
ble to students.

Decrease in

Rosenfield

by Jane Kaufman and Eric Lusk

in the 1982-53 school year, when Wall
went on leave, he received half of his
salary. The other half went into the budget
for programs, Since his return, part oi the
endowment income will again go toward
his full salary and the salary of his
secretary.

Second, Wall’s salary is rising and the
trustees planned [or a fixed budget. As
Wall's salary increases, the income
available for programs, dlmirlishes. Grey
commented, “They [the trustees] have in-
dicated at least temporarily that for ex-
citing programs people come up with,
they'll find additional money to fund it [the
Rosenfield Program].

Grey also emphasized, “But that‘s clear-
ly going to be a short run solution and in
the long run they‘re going to have to keep
raising the program funds along with his
[Wall's] salary."

Third, according to Catherine Frazer,
Dean of Faculty: “All of our budgets have
been cut. . . ” she acknowledged. “Indeed
there has been a general belt tightening,"
Frazer cemented on the shortfall of stu
dent revenues for the past year.

Finally, the Rosenfield endowment in-
vestments did not receive as high a return
as expected over the summer, thus less
money was available as income.

budget

“Clearly, if the absolute figure of the
program is set at $80,000 and [Joseph]
Wall’s salary [Director of ﬁle Rosenfield
Program in Public Affairs, International
Relations, and Human Rights] is large and
growing, then the program’s got severe
problems," stated Robert Grey, acting
director of the Rosenfield Program,
1982-83.

The Rosenfield Program which pro
motes political education in the Grinnell
College Community, is not to be coniused
with the Roseniield Lectureship which br-
ings one lecturer to Grinnell per year,

in the 1982783 school year, Wall was on
leave. Grey took control of the program,
The endowment jumped irom $20,000 to
$54,000, from the 1931-82 year to the 198283
year. in the 198384 school year, the budget
declined to a stated total of WNW/There
were {our main reasons for ﬁle drop in
budget,

ﬁrst, Wall’s salary comes directly from
the endowment specifically set aside ior
the Rosenfleld Program. Vice President
Waldo Walker explained: “The whole pro
gram was to be covered by the income
from the endowment which means mat Joe
Wall‘s salary and his secretary's salary
are supposed to come out or that also,”

Declining enrollments

cause budget deficit

by Jim Hunter

Student enrollment at Grinnell over the
last two years has declined by about 125
students, and for the second year in a row
the college has experienced a revenue
shortfall.

Grinnell College Treasurer Robert
Anderson said that while there is a deficit
on the revenue side, income from the col
lege' s endowment is more than sufficient
to balance the budget. Administrators an»
ticipated about thirty more students than
actually arrived, resulting in a revenue
shortfall of about $200,000.

Executive Vice-President Waldo Walker
provided numerical figures concerning the
decline in enrollment. Over the last two
years, enrollment has ialled irom 1,232 to
approximately 1.106 students.

Walker cited the smaller number of
college-age individuals as one reason for
the decline. With the end of the baby boom,
there has been a twenty percent decline in
the number of 18»yearolds, leaving cola
leges with a smaller pool oi applicants.

Another reason which Walker Saw for
the decline in the number of students was
the large size oi last year's graduating
class. About 35 more studenw graduated
last year than will graduate this year. This
leit a larger number or spaces to be iilled
by new students this year.

Walker expects enrollment to even out at
about 1,130 students over the next decade.

Director of Admissions John Hopkins
said that the number of new students is
about the same this year and the college is
doing well to maintain this number when
the pool oi collegeragc individuals in
declining.

However, the last two years do show a
decline of about 14 percent in enrollment of
new students when compared to the
previous two years,

Hopkins said that 75 applicants who
were accepted and requested iinancial aid
were not granted aid. He said that this
may be a factor in the decline. Hopkins
said, however, that student aid was never
cut during a student’s stay at Grinnell
unless their need for financial aid also
decreased.

Walker said that the quality of Grinnell's
program will not be aiiected by either the
current shortfall or the anticipated
smaller student. He said that no faculty
posttions will be eliminated, but
replacements may not always be hired for
faculty on leave. Furthermore, stall posi-
tions which are Vacated will be reviewed to
decide whether it is necessary to refill
them.

Walker said that students would benefit
irom the decline in enrollment through
less crowded dorms. While he agreed that
fewer students may be allowed to live off
campus, he said that currently there are
fewer students desiring to live oil campus.

Food

Food Service Director Dave McConnell
announced Tuesday before a meeting or
load service workers that the food service
budget would be tight due to the enroll-
ment decline.

The relationship between the decline in
financial aid and student needs is less
clear. Walker and Hopkins bum admitted
that the decline may be because of limita~
tions on the availability of financial aid

On the other hand, about 70 percent of
the student body is on financial aid. The
average grant to students is $4,250.

Hopkins said that in comparison to other
colleges, Grinnell is doing well and costs to
students are in the lowest quartile among
colleges oi its type. He said that Grinnell
never has been and will continue not to be
a college oi wealthy students.
