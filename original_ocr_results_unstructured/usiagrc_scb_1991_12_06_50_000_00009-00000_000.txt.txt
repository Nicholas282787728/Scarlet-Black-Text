: Allen tackles touchy topics in
j Crimes and Misdemeanors

By Louise Alcom

The Woody Allen ﬁlm fest con»
tinues with this outing from 1989.
The story centers around a successful
doctor,playedbyMartinLandau,who

, kills his mistress, This is not neces—

sarily a new plot line in the annals of
movie-makingbutthis ﬁlm isexcep-
tional in itsexamination of theeffects
of the murder on Landau’s character.

Allen himself plays a documen—
tary director whose own moral
dilemmas center around his desire
for a young woman, played by Mia

Farrow (of course) and his own disA
satisfaction with the movie industry.
When Farrow “sells out” to success,
Allen examines his life and work.
Perhaps the most powerful scene
in Crime: is the chance encounter
between Landau’s character and
Allen's at a dinner party where they
discuss, in generalizations. their own
personal and moral dilemmas. This
has become my favorite of Allen‘s
ﬁlms. As Ed from Northern Expo»
sure would say, ”I think Woody‘s a
genius." This filmwill be shown on
Monday at8:30p.m. inNonh Lounge.

Prince rocks his way to fame
in his film debut, Purple Rain

By Brett Fechheimer

Although boring and vague in
pans, Prince’s 1984 ﬁlm debut is an
enjoyable yet sober movie about a

’ young singer (Prince) struggling to

make it big and overcome the handi-
cap of a dysfunctional past. More-
over, the music in this ﬁlm is legend-
ary (for me, nothin ggenerates mem0~
ries of junior high more vividly than

the Purple Rain soundtrack) and de-
serves another listen.

Also, this is the ﬁlm which forever
destroyed the popular image of Min-
neapolis as a too»nice city populated
exclusively by Swedish-Americans.
As Prince, sassy and full of erotic
vibes. says: "This ain't no Lake
Minnetonka!" Purple Rain will be
shown on Saturday at 8:30 pm. in
North Lounge

Fantasia

0K, folks, I saw this movie ever Thanksgiving for like the third or fourth time and I still think it's one
of the best things Disney ever put out. You don‘t have to be a classical movie buff to enjoy the gorgeous
music and animation. And if, like me, you saw this ﬁlm forthe first time when it wasre-released in the 70’s,
you will ﬁnd yourself recognizing parts of the movie you never thought you’d see again, Don‘t miss it.

Fantasia will be shown tonight at 7:30, and on Sunday at 3:00 pm. in the Harris Cinema. ,

The Freshman

How to explain this movie...OK, imagine Marlon Brando basically doing impressions of himself and
a giantlirard on the almost-extinct list Mix in Matthew Broderick as acollege freshmanat ﬁlm school with
a money problem who isoffered “an offer he can‘t refuse" and you havearather dark, but interesting piece.
As an aside, it is also a critique of film»making, but don‘t let that worry you. Just enjoy. The Freshman will
