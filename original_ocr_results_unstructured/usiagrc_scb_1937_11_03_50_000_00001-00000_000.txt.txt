Tilt, Pioneers Prepare

By \Vells Barnett

Completely recovered from their
surprising is to 7 defeat by
Drake Friday, the Pioneer grid
squad this week prepared to face
a noneconferellce foe in Carleton
college, at Northfield, Minn..Sat-
urday.

Week's Work

Main efforts of the pioneers
this week will not be devoted to
new plays, but rather to a thor-
ough re-learning of the old ones,
and the polish of mechanical de-
tails of their play. Blocking and
timing of plays will come in for
serious consideration during the
week’s drills.

All the‘ squad survived last
week‘s game without serious mis-
hap, and with the exception of
Capt. Preston Evans, will be in
excellent shape for the Carleton
game. Evans is still suffering
from a capular hemorrhage re;
ceived in the Washburn game and
will not play Saturday.

Sampson Recovered

William Sampson, senior half»
back, has fully recovered from' a
pelvic injury suffered in practice
last week and will be able to go
Saturday. His injury in the
Drake game proved to he noth-
ing but a slight hone bruise.

Although the Pioneers
quite optimistic about
chances against Carleton, they
will have no set-up. The carls
will present a team which will
average about the same as the

Charles Willis was elected man-
ager of men’s ldebate at a meet-
ing of old and new members
Tuesday afternoon. _

A schedule will probably he set
within the next two weeks, ac-
cording to George Sargent, de-
bate coach and instructor in
speech.

Tryouts for varsity debate will
be held Tuesday at 4,330 p. m.,
Sargent said. Three minute
speeches will be given with two
minute rebuttals.

This will be the only means,
Sargent pointed out, for new mem-
bers to be placed on the squad
because of the return of old
members and the unfamiliarity of
the speech department with fresh-
man ability.

_ Question for debate this year
will be, ”Resolved: That the Na-
tional Labor Relations board
should be empowered to enforce
arbitration of all industrial dis-
putes.”
