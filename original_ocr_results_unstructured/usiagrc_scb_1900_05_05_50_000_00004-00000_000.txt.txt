Home Meet.

The Home Field Meet, held this
atteinoon. was marked by the ac-
customed spirit of class rivalry.
The Seniors held possession oi the
judge's stand, which was decorat-
ed with banners and appropriate
mottoes, while the grand stand
opposite was bright with the col»
ors of thecompeting classes. The
day was not particularly suitable
for a ﬁeld day, as a strong wind
blowing directly up the stretch
impeded the runners and the at-
mosphere was a little cooler than
TS conducive to the best athletic
performances.

At 2:15 the men lined up for
the loo-yard dash, in which much
interesl had centered, owing to
the strong showing of Lyman. '02,

Miss Millard's Lecture.

A very inleresllng lecture was
given in the chapel last Wednesr
dayevening, by MissMillard. Her
subject was “Greek Sculpture,"
and was beautifully illustrated by
stereopticon views.

The progress of Greek sc Ip-
ture was divided into three di is-
ions: the Archaic period;
Transitional period; and
Great period.

The Greeks held the gloriﬁca»

tion of the natural as the great
fundamental basis of art. The
archaic forms of sculpture are
characterized by stiff and unnatur-
al ﬁgures.

The transnional period is mark-
ed by the departure from archaic
to the more natural and graceful
forms of sculpture. Favoritcsulr
jects were Athletes. Myron especr
ially excelling in the Discobulus.
Strictly ornamental sculpture did
not exist; Greek sculpture always
expressed something. The iiieze
votive slabs ill the Parthenon
were for the purpose of incurring
the favor of the deities.

Of all the sculptures of the
Great period, Phidias stands forer
most. HisAtltena Partllenos and
Olympian Zeus were to the
Greeks the greatest pieces of
sculpture,

Praxiteles’ subjects were light
and cheerful in cllaracter,s|lolv-
ing the artistic love of youthtul
beauty. i~1is stalue, “Venus de
Milo,” is by far the most famed
of any existing representation oi
Venus.

There is no perfect specimen oi
Greek art of the six great Grecian
sculptors. Tile Roman copies
are close imitations. but in them
grace and

the
the

beauty ot the originals.
