l _ The Knox game provides the scene as Doug Preyder levels his
Sights on the enemy goal. Freyder and his teammates gained
sweet-revenge for an earlier loss at the hands of the Siwash as
they outran tin last break and won 71745.

The basketball team, under the direction of Coach John
Pfitsch, gave the humc tans quite a season as they won all but
their last two stands in Darby gym. Although the record was not
as good as In previous years, the team played tine ball,

Ihe grunt and groan tactics of senior Bob Miller give the
G‘rinnell matmen another winning perfunnancc. Miller wound up
his gtmllegiatc career “itli his third place gained at the conterencc

of the Gl‘inncil spurts fans, as they turned out in ever Increasing

lhe‘mnst difficult schedules pussihle.

This may not look like the pcrlormanee oi Grinnell's stellar
dash and hurdle man, but Chuck Burd rel'uscs to be bothered by
such iaets. Burr] was one oi the squad that won a second plnce at
th conference this year.

-J'The wrestling squad this season had tough breaks to add to
tough opponents, with everything from
troubles hampering their efforts

A combination of :ootball,
basketball, and track seem to
have done well by Terry Elr
lis. Ellis was the top man on
the Pioneer track squad with
his dual role as a participant

iirsts tor the Griirnellians and
topped his record with a new
shot put mark at conference.

Rudy Miller, tollowed by Skip Kingery. non Slocum, and
George Whitehill. These tour hacks picked up many vital yards
tor the charges of Coach Hank Brown.

Coach John Pfilsch looks over the boys he took to thc cun-
Vl'el‘encc meet. Bob Skl'ilinkll, and Phil Bonnet, the two on the left
