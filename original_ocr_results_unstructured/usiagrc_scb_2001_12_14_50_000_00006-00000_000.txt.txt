When ﬁrst»y:ars hegan ariiiiing on campus her fall, they knew raul pasqiiesi
'o almosr immedinrely. He was not known heeaiise he was an old high school
friend or a familiar face. rhough. He was simply Naked Paul..

“There were kids 1 nier during new student days who already knew who l
was because ofmy r:putanon,” Pasquesi said. “That was kind ofcool, But then
rhere were people who were like, ‘You’re Naked Paul,’ and rhoiighr l was a
whore because ofit."

Pasquesi, a Religions Srodies inaior, eniried his repurarion 4: Naked Paul in
his ﬁrst year at Grinnell in 1997 when he “used to streak all the time," he said,
He was friends with three other Pauls and other acquaintances needed a way to
keep the four separare.

“To differenriare us, people were rryiiig ro come up with nicknames,"
risquesi said. “air one poinr, we all rried ro give each orhar nicknames or rried
to stick to hlgh school nicknames that we had. but those didn'l catch. So then
people srarred to give us nicknames hecaiise l was always naked, 1 was Naked
Paul. I thought min: flowed better than Socialist jewish Paul [Bcndieh ‘0] ]."

Pasquesi cemenred his repurarion as Naked Paul diiring Halloween 1999.
Broke and needing a cosrume for Halloween parries, he ruriied ro his class on
the Hebrew Bible for inspiration.

“We jusi happened to he reading lsaiah at the riine," Pasquesi said. “we
got to Isaiah 20:2-4 where it says that basically he walked around butt naked
for rhree years and proresred rhe Assyrian War. I thought, ‘Heyi I could do

rhar.' So I just ﬁguied I’d go naked."

Pasqnesi did iusr that, arrendirig various Hal»
loween parties with a few words written on his
body in red marker as his only covering. Like

rhe Biblical prepher, Pasquesi said he also
gave predicrions ro anyone inreresred ar the
parries, alrhough his oracles had more ro do

' with the caring ofmushrooms rhan rhey did with
the fall ofIsrada

The reaceions he gor ro his eosrume were varied, pasouesi said. While
a few people were offended, he said the majoriry ofparrygoers rhar nighr
were amused with his lack of attire.

“The haskerhall ream that year was going as a Girl Scout rroop,"
pasouesi said. “They showed up. and as they were coming in rhe door ro
rhe party. rhey kepr slapping my ass."

Not all were quire so eager to ger close ro Pasquesi. rhough.

“[Professor oinsrory] George Drake was rorally freaked out when
I ran into him," Pasquesi said. “That was emharrassing."

Pasquesl said, now that h: is about :0 leave Grinnell, his naked clays
mighr he numhered. He is planning on moving to Chicago ar rhe end
ofth: Semestﬂi where he will reach high school in the fall and hopes to
ger inro puhlishing.

“I can’t really do the naked rhing so much now because I'm look-
ing for iohs," Paxquesi said. “lr’s not so respecrahle."
