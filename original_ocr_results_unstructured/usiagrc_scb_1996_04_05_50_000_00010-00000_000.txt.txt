Dear Todd,

While you were visiting, you
didn’t ger around to eating in rhe
caiereria. Had you, you would have
encounrered vegerarian food unlike
any you’ve experienced heiore,

At one school we attended,
the main i-egerariaiioprion was hioc—
colicasserole. Though it \i'aS ivhole
soinc,good,unti filling, it did become
monotonous, As a plump yegc
an, I benefited from this diillne e
arreri,ourol'shcei boredomsiopprd

of excess weight. A vegetarian diet
unlike rhar one is a blessing.

Not too fat from that college,
the city’s most promincntvegctarian
restaurant seems to approach vege»
tarianism as a form of penance for
years ofeating meat Nobody I know
likestheitfood, butalorof people eat
it. Most of my friends who eat there
do so to show community solidarity,
to do at least one positive thing for
their health, or think that the com-
munity requires it. The food is see—
ondary—thebreadappearstobecom—
pacted sawdust, and “health” con-
stantly tnumphs over “taste." It’s
remarkablewhatpeoplewilleatwhen
they feel guilty enough, Thankfully,
the vegetarian food here is unlike
that.

Unfortunately, the vegetari—
an food is also unlike the food at my
favorite Middlc»Eastem restaurant.
Designed neither for monomaniacs
nor flagellants, the food is simply
good food which happens to be veg-
etatian. ir tastes good, cosrs lirrle,
and has plenty of delicious options
even for Vegans. The spicing is rust
rightineither too foreign {or the
average American palate, nor given
to assimilationist blandness. If only
the cooks here cooked like that!

Dining services seems to be
making a sincere effort, Lessons,
good recipes, and practice may even
tualiy improve matters. They‘re ale
ready looking into having the option
ofsoy milk brought back. Someday
they may be told that humus is com—
posed of chickpeas, tehim, fresh garr
licI and lemonjuice. withasplash of
olive oil. i could get them a recipe
and some serving suggesrions if rhey
desired, Perhaps we could also bring
in someone to discuss {alafel and its
possible accessories.

One knows vegerorian dish—
es are a real success when it’s not just
the vegetarians eating them
