Disability talk exposes

BY ABBY RAPOPORT

Meetings for the Political Science department are held on
the third ﬂoor of Nollcn House. Mcars Cottage, although
newly renovated, has toilets unusually low to the ground. Stut
dent refrigerators are moved out of rooms two days before
students lcavc. Although many at Grimicll are used to small
inconveniences, for some these seemingly minor issues are ac-
tually much larger problems.

A group er30 people, ranging in age from fourth grade to
retirement, participated Tuesday in the ﬁrst dialogue on dis-
abilities to discuss such issues. The roundtable discussion was
the ﬁrst ofthree events marking Disability Awareness Week, a
week sponsored by the Ad-hoc committee on Issues of Diss
abilityTlie committee, chaired by Ralph savarese, English, and
Director ofAcademic Advising Joyce Stern, formed in the fall
of2004 and soon opened itselfup to students and faculty.

Eliza Willis, Political Science, who walks with a can: due
to Childhood polio, finds it difﬁcult to make the trek from her
Carnegie office to the meeting space in Nollen House. savarese
suffers from severe arthritis and therefore has trouble bending
his knees.

Building renovations are of particular concern to many. The
Forum is one orrhe most inaccessible buildings on campus for
those in wheelchairs due to its numerous levels. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires new and newly renovated
buildings to be wheelchair accessible,but because most campus
buildings are old, they do not need to meet these codes. Be-
cause of this, the architect himself, who is now in a wheelchair,
cannot attend the building’s commemoration this week. “Be
cause it’s the center of campus, it’s probably scared away some
[potential] students with disabilities," said Stern.

Some accommodations have been made. Plans for some
new buildings take into account the needs of those with dis
abilities. For instance, East campus dorms are even with the
ground and have elevators. Herrick Chapel now has real time
closed captioning.

One roundtable participant with Type I diabetes shared his
experience or getting dict, caffeine tree soda installed in the
dining halls, although this does not address the more serious
problem of unsrefrigerated medication during the last two days
of school.

This is one of many changes that some feel aren’t occurring
as quickly as they should According to Stem, the new campus
center will have stairs in the front requiring thosc' in need of a
ramp to go to a side entrance, afact thatupsether “lrsjust that
we had the opportunity to do it right,’ she said.

While not against ADA regulation, Stern and others felt
it did not reﬂect adequate sensitivity. “There's a difference,"
said Savarese, “between ADA compliant and ADA generous."

Savatese believes much more could be done to/make Grinnell
a “friendlier place for people with disabilities,"both in terms or
facilities and assistance.

Students and faculty must often take the initiative to get
assistance. According to committee member Hannah Zurko
'08, Grinnell provides ample support "ifyou come forward and
propose what you need."

For many, this policy puts undue pressure on students, raths
er than the school. “The burden should be on the institution,
not the individual," said Dilara Yarborough ’06, who is also a
member of the Committee. Of particular concern to roundtas
ble participants was the skepticism With which society views
non-visible disabilities, pmticularly Attention Deficit Disorder
(ADD).

To combat skepticism and streamline responses to special
needs, disability has been incorporated into Grinnell's strategic
plan and its efforts to promote campus diversity. Jim Sum~
net, director of Admission and a member of the'cominittee,

has worked on methods of recruiting disabled students. The
committee has also looked at ways to attract more faculty and
stalfwith disabilities. According to Stern, there has not been a
student in a wheelchair attending Grinnell since 1992.

During the roundtable, many questioned why disability was
not included in community discussions of diversity. “[Disability
rights] is not a sexy issue,"said Yarberough.

The committee hopes that Disability Awareness Week will
raise consciousness among the campus, and encourage calls for
change. Many committee members believe that change will
gradually accommodate all types of diversity. ‘I want to be—
lieve, said savarese, that a progressive liberal arts education is
accessible to anyone with the scores.

In addition to the roundtable discussions, the week’s acis
rivities included Assistive Technopoly, a board gameioriented
session where students learned how to interact with different
kinds of assistive and adaptive technologies for the disabled,
and screenings of the film My ch/ Foot.
