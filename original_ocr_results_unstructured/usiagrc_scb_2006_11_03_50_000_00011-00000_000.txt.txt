Men's soccer in first MWC Tournament since 2000

av DAN HARDIN

Heading into fall break, the men's soccer team held a four
point advantage in the standings over secondrplace St. Norr
bertr The men had just run their unbeaten steak to nine straight
games, eclipsiug the old school record oreight games.

They have gone 0-2-1 since, including a loss against pre—
season conference favorite St. Norbert, and have fallen to third
in the MWC. But the unbeaten streak was good enough to el-
evate the Pioneers from preseason afterthoughts to postseason
contenders. Grinntll will be competing in the MWC tournar
merit for the first time since 2000.

To reach the championship game, however, the Pioneers
will first have to defeat the Green Knights of St. Norbert. On

the visiting Green Knights earned a 1-0 victory. An early goal
from the visitors was the game's only score,

The Pioneers had their best chance when Alexander EXT
hares '10 lined up a penalty kick early in the second half. St.
Norbert goalkeeper Mike Rietveld guessed right and turned
away the attempt. Grinnell got a few more chances to score
but ran out of steam after Milan Pepovic ‘09 was ejected with
a red card.

In the three games prior to the St. Norbert game, the Pio—
neers went 1-0-2 with a 3-2 win over Ripon and 0-0 draws
against Carroll and Lake Forest. A Lake Forest victory over
Carroll then clinched Grinnell’s first postseason berth in six

ears.
