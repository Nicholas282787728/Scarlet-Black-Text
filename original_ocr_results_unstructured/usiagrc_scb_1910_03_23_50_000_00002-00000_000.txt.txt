THE COLLEGE HOME.

The ettoit which is being made to
organize a home tor the men ot the
college along the lines suggested in true
other column oi the Starlet and math
cannot receive too much commenda
tion. According to some of the most
eminent critics- ot the worlt of the pres
ent day college the worst iailuie in
tue entire system of education is the
iailure to recognize and provide the
need ior an adequate college home lite
tor the students. There ls, honever,
an impression that this can only he
developed along the lines oi the tra~
teraity and it is only where the tra-
ternity is actively organized that it
is possible to get the home me that
the men ot the college need. The
iraternity is the result oi unaided, un-
directed student effort along this line.
When the students and the college cor
operate together to provide a home
life tor ever-y man in the college somer

- thing bigger and tar more in harmony
with the educational ideals that have
existed in the country the past cerrtrrry
will result. G rinnell is the ﬁrst
college in the west aside lronr \Viscmr

this plan provides tor and the result

The suggestion ot prov ding the

the time ot the state meet is certainl)
a good one. A display oi pennants
and medals in some of the college
buildings might be one very line teat-
ure in such a plan,

The stand tuhen against the regular
