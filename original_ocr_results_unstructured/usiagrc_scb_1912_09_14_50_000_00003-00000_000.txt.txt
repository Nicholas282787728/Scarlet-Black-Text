SHEPHERD ﬂF THE HILLS PLEASES

Dramatization is Disappointing
But Cast Does Good
Work.

The thratl-icai season has opened in
Grinncll very auspiciousl)‘ last Wod-
nesday evening by the presentation or
a dramatization oi Harold Bell Wright's
“shepherd ot the Hills." Although the
audience u as not very large an intense
interest was mantlested throughout.

Lovers of Wright's horcl were some-
uhat disappointed in the dramatiza-
tion because several rather essential
details must necessarily be sacriﬁced
in order to make it possible to pro-
duce the play. Lac]: or unity and hick
or action on the stage were the most
noticeable defects. The cast was un-
usually wellrllalzlutetl.

While there were no particular stars
in the company. the work both indis
ridunliy and coliectileii was good.

Tile character oi Preachin‘ Bill was
particularly wellrtﬂken and the hack-
wootls liie in h 'ssoul- is tipihed ill a
highly humorous style. Fete was one
of the most pleasing characters ill lhe
play. One noticeable ieaturc was the
excellent nork of the minor characters
and the general cflert or the play was
good.

LARGE ATTENDANCE AT Y. M-

State Secretary Parsons Gives
Splendid Talk at the First
Meeting.

The first meeting or the i", M. C. A
uas contilltted Thursday evening hi'
\i‘. M. Parsons, state secretary, with
the topic, "What a Mail Owes to His
Colltge.” Mr. Far as is a graduate or
Grinlleli and knows the ideals and stan~
(lm'ds or this institution thorouglll.
Tile ﬁrst point or his tail; was that a
loan owes loyalty to the irlcllls or his
institution.

Glinueil was founded hi nicn uho
had a purpose. This college was es-
tablished by no mere turn at thante,
The men who tntlurctl the hardships or

:lltm 1hr ii as at tllcil ideals and any
nun u o mics llet'c anti is not willing
to .lhldc by these standards has no place
in the community,

Furthermore, a man owes it to his
colil e to make himselt as 1)li_\ tally
able as pcssihic. A man cannot be
ulcntall, ﬁt unless he is nhi'. tally fit.
A man cannot nilorll to neglect his re-
ligious training in coilge. either. it
is the most vital thing a man gains in
college.

The new men were out in goodly mime

a splendid start.
