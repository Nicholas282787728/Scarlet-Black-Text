QPDRE

By ALLEN COOPER

A large nnmhcr of the high school
track stars who participated in the
Gl‘llmell Interscholastic meet here
two weeks ago will he back again
Saturday to take part in the State
Interscholastic meet. Prominent
among the group are Floyd DeHeer
of Oskaloosa, Bush Lamb of Newton,
Schlotterheek of Guthrie center, and

Rodrick of East High, Des Moines.
c r e

DeHeel'. who set new Interscholas-
tic records in hoth the discus and the
shot put, is almost certain to set a
new state record in the latter event.
The present record of 43 feet. 10 9—10
inches is held by Earl of North Des
Monies. DeHeer won the sta‘te event
last year with a heave of as feet;
his 1nterscholstsic record made at
Grinnell two weeks ago is 52 feet, 10
inches, and he gave proof that he
can consistently throw better than
51 feet by winning his district meet
at Fairfield with a toss of 51 feet,
iii/p inches.

. . .

Lamb of Newton, who also set
two new Interscholastic records, ran
the 120-yard low hurdles in :15.8 in
the district meet at Valley Junction,
one~tenth of a second faster than his
Interscholastic record. He also ran
the low hurdle event in better time
than his Interscholastic record, go-
ing the distance in :2”, in compari-
son with his Grinnell mark of 25 sec-
onds flat.

s . .

Schlotterheck of Guthrie Center
won the halfemile run at valley
Junction in 2:032, which was several
seconds slower than his Interscholas-
tic record of 2:01. Nevertheless, he is
expected to battle it out with Graves,
present state record holder from
Cherokee, for the SSH-yard champions
ship on Saturday.

. o -.

Redrick of East High. Des Moines,
won two firsts and a second at the
Valley Junction district meet to qual-
ify for the finals in three events. His
mark of 5 feet 11 inches in the high
jump was the best made in all eight
of the district meets, He also won
first in the hroad jump, and second
in the shot put.

. r .

Babe Moulton of the University of
Iowa seems to he a gluttnn for pun-
ishment as far as falling in hurdle
races is concerned. Leading the field
in the low hurdle event at the state
college meet Saturday. he stumhlea
and fell on the next to the last hur-
dle and failed to place. Last month at
the Drake relays, he fell in the shut-
tle relay at a time when it seemed
possible that the Iowa team would
make a new record in the event, put»
ting the Hawkeyes out of the run—
