Du, a play by the mysterious Jane
Mamn that deals with the conuoverr
sial issue of abortion.

KeelyandDu , like all ofMartin's
plays, deals with controversial
women's issues. Sophomore Sarah
Gavitt plays Keely, a woman who is

raped by her chhusband and seeks an
abortion. She ends upchaincdtoahed
in abascmcnt, kidnapped by Christian
prorlifersFirstyearKristyZtvichplays
Du, the elderly nurse who befriends
her. Walter, sophomore Matthew
Wagner, is the Christian minister who
kidnaps her and Cole, played by ﬁrst
year Doug Emmett, is her alcoholic
and abusive exrhusbund.

Host decided to direct this play
because of its political theme and its
timeliness. She pointed out that the
issue ofabortion is especially relevant
now, with the new Republican majors
rty trying to change abortion rights.
“I'm a political science major and so I
knew if I ever wanted to direct some-
thing I wanted it to concern political
issues as well. This play makes [the

abortion rssue] really personal. 1 like
the play because it doesn't make any-
one rnto a real villain. Everyone in the
play is very human."

cal, read on. Papaya Messiah, a
loiigsrunning pop band, has found that
Grinnell patents tend to love their perfor-
mances, The group isn’t bothered a bit.

‘Tltey love us We don’t know
why," commented senior Andrew
Rosackcr (bass). “Last year we played at
the SetrtorS/20ir=caso. They just ate us up
it was amaatrg "

“[Pai-ents] stood up. and they

neverseen Ihalmany parents stand. ltwas
scary." The hand even reported receiw'ng
offers from parents to play at parties

What would elicit this overwhelm-
ing parental crowd?

The parents' interestscems to come

(two members are muSIC majors) and its

' respect for live audiences

‘We’mnotuutmshband,"saidanl.
“Distortion is a good thing, and you cart
achieve cool affects wrlh distortion, Vols
time is a great thing, you can shatter
windows,youcan blow pcopichack But
that’s not what it‘s about... We strive for
abalanoe that wecan achieve any volume
wrthout kilhng someone on Sound."

Papaya Mess-rah also enyuys Ilie
pctfonnanw aspect of a concert.

“Its also about sliowmanship ," said
Brant. “Because in a live setting, its not
justwhat you hearanymore. Its the show.
The show is what we look like, where we

move, what happens. We tried some
crazy things. We put paint on our face.
We set our hands on ﬁre while we were
playing one rughL"

Junior Dave Collman (keyboards)
added, "That's the fun thing about live
performance, is thatanythingcanhappen.
You neverlqtowwhattoexpectwidtalive
performance."

“When you're playing live you
change what you're playing to fit whattlre
audience does,” said sophomore Seth
Hoslcr (drums) “Its an interaction, itsnot
a one—way thing "

“lfyou don'trelatetorlreaudienceio

why that‘s fun, that you get to enjoy the
person—to—person aspect which is really
what music is all about."

The group has found a comIonable
role playing in other cities. Papm‘a Mess
sl'ult hasn’tyetperformcd in Grinnell lltis
year. They don't dislike Grititielllians;
they simply prefer new audiences.

“lLs because they don't have to like
you," said l-iusier.
