GnlNNELL's LOSS
No more or a shock and surprise
could have been handed to Gi'innelle‘
inns than the resignation or “Doc":

he had been so much a part of Grins

A' Kansas City paper said at the
time of the ’annnunceinent or his res—,
ignation; “Doc" iiutt is the most sues
Cessfnl coach of sprinters the Valley
has ever had . . . and Grinnell-s loss
is irreparable.”

But El premier tl‘ﬂclx' coach is not
all that Grinllell loses with the depar-
ture of Don Huff. Few except those,
who have worked with him know how
much he has meant to all branches of
athletics at Grinnell, and how much
his fourteen years at this school have
had to do with making Grinuell, small
though it is, big in the athletic world.

duct, and although never a preacher
nor a reformer, Doc’s own character,
and his sound advice when solicited,
helped many to attain a broader view
of lite. To know Doc was to admire
him and many a man as a iresliman
has set him as his ideal.‘
Praised by Papers

No more deserving praise could be
paid to Doc than that or the Kansas
City star on the announcement of his
election as track coach at Kansas uni—
versity. “Dr. Huts is a tmc example
for college students, or a calm, linen-l
citable, quiet, thorough and caretnl:
temperament, with no vices, and a.
character irrepl‘oachable.”

To say that Grinnell's loss is irre—
parable is putting it mildly, but Doc
has given so much to Orinneli that
no Grinncliian would wish to deny
him the chance for added tame that
his new position at Kansas will give1
him. Grinnell's loss is Kdnsas’s gain,‘
and all who know Doc unite in otter—l
