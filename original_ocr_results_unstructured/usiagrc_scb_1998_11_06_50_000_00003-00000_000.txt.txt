R.E.M.'s new album Up

BY HUNG PHAM
StaffWritct

Change doesn'r have so be earrh—sharrer-
ing so be imporranr. REM’s new album, en.
rirled i/p, rakes rhe band in a deeidedly differ
enr direcrion, bur srill remaining very much
REM.

lr’s been rwo years since REM released
rheir lasr album, New Aaucnnerer in Heir. Ale
rhough it was nor a commercial success, New
Adi/armada conrained a number of brillianr
gems, including “Elcctrolite," “Zither,” and “E-
Bow rhe Lerrer." A couple shings have changed
since rhen. Eill Berry, R.E,M.'s drummer, left
rhe band in an amicable splir. Eerry's depar»

Peter Buck, and Mike Mills—wirhour a per.
manenr drummer However, it also allowed rhe
band so experimcnt inscrumenraliy, On a num-
ber ofsongs on Up, drum madiirtes and key.
board riffs play prominenrly in rhe music. This
is a significanr deparrure from she rradirional
REM sound, in a recent inserview for Pulse
magazine, Buck said ofrhe changes, “We fig—
ured on the last record, Nzw Aduenmm in Hi-
Fi‘, we had done rhe drums, bass, and guirars
'-rhing abous as well as we could do ir," Added
Stipc,“1twastrulyan experimcnr on all levels,
and I drink we came ous ofir wish somerhing
prcsry specracular."

The inssrumenrarion is nor rhe only dung
rharhas been revamped. Despire rhe album‘s
rirle, rhe mood and rempo of Up is decidedly
mellow and understated. The songs ofren have
an armosphericqualiry (due in part to she lay-
ering ofeleerronic sounds). and snpe's vocals
are even more wisrfully somber rhan usual.

Overall, Up delivers rhe goods. The pros
ducrion and musicianship is top—notch, The
album is srrorigrhroughour, with a couple
gems and only rhe occasional clunker. The firsr
track, “Airporrman' is a sofsly melodic piece,
with §ripc singing iusr above a whisper. “Hope”.
is one of she more unconvenrional songs. A

fasr.paced drum loop provides rhe backdrop

ro R.E.Msrrademarkcrypriclyrics: “you know
rhar it sounds ehildish/ rhas you've dreamr of
alligators.” The song was inspired by Leonard
Cohen's song “Suzanne." “Why Not Smile,"
"Sad Professor," and “Falls ro Climb" are rhree
orher srrong songs,

Tire highlighrs of rhe album, however,
are "Daysleepor," “Ar My Moss Beautiful," and
“I’m nor over you."

"Daysleeper," is she first single off of Up
irs a wonderfullysad, inrrospecrive song. with
Ssipes plainrive voice at us most evocarive lyr-
ics ar lhcir besr; “1 see roday wirh a newsprinr
fray/My nighr is colored headache grey," On
“At My Mosr Beauriful," rhe band raises an al»
mosr rerro, pianobased approach. According
so she band, rhe song was inspired by Beach
Boy Brian Wilson, complere wirh harmonic
ing backup singers and sappy-sweet lyrics; “I
eounr your eyelashes, secretly, wirlr every one.
whisper I love you." “I’m Nor Over you“ is an
unlisred rrack, appearing just afser "Diminr
ishcd." only a minure long and backed only
by an acousric guirar, rhe song is perhaps she
mosr personal sounding ofrhe album.

There are only a couple disappoinrmenrs
on rhe album. The jazzyrfunky “Lorns,” is
prerry forgersabic.

and “The Apologisr” is only sorso. How.
ever, rhis is just personal rasre. According ro
Mills, “Louis" will be rhe second single offdre
album.

R,E.M's is perhaps rhe mosr accom-
plished group ofrhe “alrernarive rock" genre,
With rheir credenrials, rhey could have easily
produced a highly markerable album sporring
the traditional REM. sound. lnsread, rhey
deci'ded ro sry some new shings with Up Apr
parenrly, she changes haven’rhurt rhem. ln us
first week, the album debuted at number 5.
and “Dayslecpct” has received strong radio and
relevision airplay Up doesn’r reinvenr rock, bur
ir deﬁniroly rakes rhe R.E.M. sound in a dif—

ferent direction.

“organic ctreinisrry“

When I asked how rhey mer, iefiTyner ’99
and bririn Cochran '99 replied wirh rhose two
words Whllc rhcy were referring ro rhe aca-
demic course CHM 221, Iliad a conceprion
ofa narurai easygoing inreraerion berween rhe
nvo sryhsucaily conrrasred musictans,Tliough
ihasi rnisunds-rsiood, i soon learned rhar there
was indeed an “organic chemistry” berween
rhcm rhar has allowed rhem ro overcome rhcir
musical differences,

Today marks the rwo year anniversary of
rheu parrnership, which rhey will celebrate
wirh a performance at Bob’s open Mic Nighr.
They plan ro perform Eric Clapton‘s “Run-
ning on Fairlr‘ and Bob Dylan’s “Ailrilong Lhe
Warclirowcr" of irrni Hendrik fame. The rwo

are known for writ-
itlgaihitdsongim»
mediareiy before
cheir performance.

“Even rhough
we have rwo very
differenr sryles,
rhey rend ro mesh
prerry well," said
Tyner.

Tyner defines
his sryle as “mellow
rock ‘n' roll and
folk, 1 also play clas-
sical guisar . . . clas.
sical techniques
have inﬂuenced my

playing a tor.“ ln addirion, he plays keyboard,
rrumper, medieval lose and renaissance guisar.
He lists Pink Floyd, U2, Crcedcncc Clcurwatet
Revival, and music ofrhe classical era as inﬂu-
ences orlus music.

Cochran, who prefers more bear and bass
rype music, also plays flarpick bluegrass gui—
rar, bass, mandolin, and banjo in addirion ro
convenrionrl guisar. Though, like Tyner. he is
influenced by Pink Floyd, Cochrans rasre may

be: classiﬁed as “hcavicr.” Among his inﬂu-
ences are Alice in Chains and Tool.

They had each performed individually,
but met two years ago and discovered a com»
mon musical interest: “We tczlizcd we both
played Merallica guirar," says Tyner.

“Now our styles are not anywhere near
that," adds Cochran. While thcy perform
mostly originals, they still cover two
Mctallicasongs, “Fade to Black” and “One."

Yet, some of the duo’s most popular
songs in past years hav: been covets: “Pul-‘f,
rhe Magic Dragon," and an ‘805 glam—rock
medley

“Claire’s Song," another popular piece,
is an original composirion mar rhcy wrorc
lasr year which was used by Dance Troupe.
“Claire’s Song" was she ﬁrst time rharTyner
and Cochran collaborated on a song,
whereas rhey had previously wrirren songs
individually.

Though shey borh play guisar at their
performances, rhey share singing duties,
performing lead voice on she songs which
they write. Most of their performing has
been ar Bob’s Open Mic Night, and rhey
have had a show in die pasr. In fact, diey
plan for anorher show in rhe future.

NeirherTyner, a Biology/ Music double
major, nor Cochran, a Chemisrry mayor,
plan to make a career oimusic. Though
Tyner admirs char music is a grearlove which
he enjoys more than Biology, he afﬁrms that
“the job market is much better in Biology.”
He considers possibly reaching guirar as a
second career, though. “I just really enjoy
music. . . I enjoy playing music more dian
lisrening ro it.”

While they will both graduate this spring
and go their separare ways, Cochran says
that “if we ever run into each other, we’ll
