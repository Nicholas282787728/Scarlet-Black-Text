“We played well against Knot," coach
Tom sonniehsen said. “They've got a strong
pitcher and we were able to score the runs we
needed to win."

The Pioneers snuffed out the Prairie Fire

offense were Darcy Ward '09 with a pair of doubles and three
RBls, Emily Stewart ’08, who went three for three with two
RBIs, and Tess Cohen '09 and Megan Germet ’08, who had

both the men and women placed several rune
nets in the distance events. only a few Pioe
necrs Scored in the field and sprint events, but
the teams had strong showings overall, as the
men ﬁnished fifth of18 teams and the women
took sixth of 17.

Katic Ryan ’07 was one of three Pioneers
to earn a ﬂISFplaCc finish during the week-
end, and she did so in dominant fashion. Her
time of 38:59.92 in the

to have fun,” Ryan said of
her goal for the meet. “I

Other notable scorers from the women’s

team include Molly Kratz ’08, who took fourth .

iii the 400*meter dash with a time of 60.91.
In the ISOO-meter tun, Sarah Spencer ’07 ﬁnr
ishcd in 4:47.51,just a second behind winner
Amber Brandenburger from Nebraska Wes-
leyan. Becky Bessinger ’09 took fourth with a
time of4:58.70.

The men followed suit by earning a firsts
place ﬁnish in a distance event and placing
several others. Nick Sparr ’09 edged out Eric
osterhaus from Simpson college by just un-
der five seconds to win the 10k in a time of
3211899. David Montgomery '10 finished
third, twelve seconds behind Osterhaus, to
round out a top three that all ﬁnished 45 sec-
onds ahead ofthc fourth-place finisher.

Willic Stewart ’09 was the Pioneers' only
roperhree finisher in a field event, taking first
in the javelin throw with a distance of 184’—S”
(56.22 meters), a throw nearly seven feet fur-
ther than IllC secondrplncc ﬁnisher.

Other toptcight ﬁnishers from the men's
team include Tommy Jamison ’09, who placed

week due to inclement weather.

“My feeling is that most people are very frustrated and dis»
appointed [with the weather],”Madison Salandcr ’08 said.

This season was originally tagged as the team's “home sea
son" because of an abundance of home games in the initial
schedule, but the Pioneers have not seen action on their home
diamond since the end of March at the Hy-Vee Invitational.
The Pioneers have played 18 games this season, between four
and 12 games fewer than every other team in the conference.

Weather permitting, the Pioneers will finally get another
chance to play at home when they host doubleheaders against
a couple of MWC foes this weekend. Lake Forest will be in
town tomorrow for a doubleheader scheduled for 1 pm. before
Grinnell takes on Monmouth on Sunday at 1 pm.

Student Athletic Advisory Committee and the softball
team will be promoting their game against Lake Forest Saturt
day with giveaways and a BBQ

"We’re so excited, I can't even describe how great it will be,"
salander said. “we will hopefully be able to take some revenge
against Lake Forest for beating us in [the MWC tournament
last year.”

Charlie Knuth '08, who took fifth in the 5000-
meter run with a time of16:20.58.

While Grinneil has developed a tradition
.of distancetrunning success during the track

season, it has struggled to consistently score
in the sprint events. Kratz' ﬁnish was the only
top-ﬁve finish in a sprint event (400 meters or
shorter) for either the men's or women’s team.

“It’s hard [to be competitive in the sprints]

because we don't always have a real consistent
sprint coach to recruit for that," Ryan said.
“The facilities at Grinnell
aren’t great for indoor
sprinting, so our sprinters
and middlerdistance runs
ners just come out for the
outdoor season.”

Heather Benning has
been the sprint coach in

' ' ast ears but is currentl

Katie Ryan 07 in sabbatical. When she i};
actively coaching, she also
has responsibilities as the
head women's soccer coach

to juggle, cutting into her ability to help With
track recruiting.

Ryan noted Kmt'L’ success and pointed to
success in some sprint relay events at the end
of last season to show that Grinn‘ell has shown
an ability to produce competitive sprint ath-
letes. She also said that Kate Dicdrick‘07 was
projected to be a top sprinter for the team bct
tote being sidelined due to an injury.
