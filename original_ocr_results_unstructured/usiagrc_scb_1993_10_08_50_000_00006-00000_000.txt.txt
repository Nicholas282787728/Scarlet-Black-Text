Month-Old Be

By Justin Glanvtlle

LTHOUGH members Henry
ATltroop, Dan Sharp, and

John Siqveland are vctcr-
ans to the campus music scene, the
trio‘s most recent project, Board of
Bees, is a mere four weeks old.

The idea was fortned at Regis»
nation in August, when Throop. a
cellist. bumped into Sharp, 3 guitar
isi/organist, in line. Sharp promptly
added long-time cohort Siqveland
(also a guitarist) to the lincrup, and
was inspired by an episode of The
Simpson: to call the trio Beard of
Bees.

Says Throop,“The music is your
basic acoustic guitar/voice type of
stuff. buta bit weirder [than normal],
with somecello and organ tossed in.“

“We make melody-based, well-
developed pop music," says Sharp.
Most of the material is written indi-
vidually; Siqveland generally writes
the basic song and Sharp adds the
fancier touches. Throop then eon-

tributes his own cello linestoihe mix.
Though the bulk of their songs are
original, Beard of Bees has been
known to cover tunes by Minnesota
bands “of various genres."

Sharp’s writing is heavily influr

spite Throop's aversion to the famed
group (“I really kind of hate them,"
he states). The senior physics major

Spidey Climbs the Silver Screen

By Matt Afferton

HAT is it that really makes Grinnell College a unique instituta
s)" of higher learning? Perhaps the frequent appearances of
certain colorfully»costumed superhero would qualify as
justifiable answer!

In recent years, students have caught a glimpse of a spider»lil<e figur
crouched on the wall or roof ofa distant building, have sat next to him i
Quad as heenjoyed ahealthy meal. or perhaps even had aconversation wit
him during ajauntacross the south-campus loggia, butthis year, Grinnel
students will see the Amazing Spider-Man as never before.

This year, Spidey climbs the silver screen.

The effort began when a group of theater students approached th-
wondrous wcbrslingcr with an offer he couldn't refuse: a chance to le
others see behind the mask. The story of the hero within, entitled Th
Origin, was a ten-minute film which premiered during iheGrinncll Colleg-
Titular Head Film Festival, It was conceived as a prologue to an epi-
adventure to be produced in 1993/94.

Without the support of the Grinnell College Theater Department
Spidey would have never been able to leap to such heights, but thanks i.
Department Chair Sandy Moffctt. Assistant Professor of Theater Pt-
Gordon, and the rest of the Theater Department staff, the motion picture ot
Grinncll’s rcsrdcni superhero is well on its way.

Thcproject has drawn an array of multi-ialenied students and Grinncl
College faculty and staff. with talent in acting. Specialscffmtsﬁdiling :in
scripting. Zandcr Cannon, Grinnctl’s celebrated cartoonist and writer o
the “Chainsaw Vigilante” comic book. nationally published by NC\
England Comics. wrote the original script for the movie. Sandy Moffcti
will be playing the role of J. Jonah Jameson, and Bemcil Mueller will b
reappearing as the hero’s lovably frail Aunt May. The pool oftalcnt has no
been limited to the digealrically inclined, however. Chances are John Ston
of the Math/Computer Science Department and Martin Minellt of the
Chemistry Department will be appearing in the movie as well.

The Origin was quite a teaming experience for all involved; very few
came into the project with any knowledge of video recording and editing,
and had to rely on their theater skills to guide them through the intricacies
offilm-making. This year, more familiar with the film making process, the
team will be using the professional standard in videorecording media. new
sound recording paraphernalia, and above all, the wisdom gained from The
Origin. The upcoming film, in which Spidey must defeat a super-villain
named "The Scorpion," will integrate costumes, lighting, sound, special-
effects, and camera work into an actionrpacked extravaganza.
