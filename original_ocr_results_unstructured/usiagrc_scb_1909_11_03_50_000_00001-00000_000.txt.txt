Grinuell meets Simpson next Friday
at lndiauola, in what should prove to
be one of tlle closest and hardest
fought games on the Grillnell schedule.
The scarlet and black defeated snnp.
son the last time by a big score, l. 0,
but the condition or the teams this
year are considerably changed. G '
hell in all probability has just as
good a team as it has had in several
years, but on the other hand, under
the efficient Coaching of “Uclck” Kirk,
Simpson has taken great strides in ads
vance and is classed among the best
teams in the state.

If comparative scores thus far this
season are to be taken into consider

while on the other hand the blue and
White downed Grinnell 32 to 0. Howe
ever comparathe scores are very un-
certain in football and should be cons
sidered rather lightly in forecasting
the final outcome of a game. But the
fact that simpson never has won but
two out of the eight games played
with Grinnell, gives the scarlet and
black some prestige.

turn out the best team in the west.
