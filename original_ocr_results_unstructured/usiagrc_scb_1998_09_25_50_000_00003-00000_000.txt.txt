Remember that guy who used a
letter from his mom as part ofhis cam»
paign when he ran for the position of
son presidentz Well he won die elec.
tion, and for those ofyou who don't
already know, his name is Perar
Klaersch '99.

Blonde and blue eyed as he may
be, Klaersch is not just anorher pretty
face. Being president ofrhe SGA is a
multifaceted and time consuming iob.
“We need to determine what the stu-
dents of Grinnell want and then try
and promote that on various levels,”
says l<laetsch. Among his responsibili-
ries as SGA President is to interact

'closely with the student body of
Grinnell. He voices various student
opinions at Joint Board, meets with
the President ofme College Russell K.
Osgood once a week, and talks with
administrators. What lclaersch likes
most about his iob is that he works
with “inrelligent, motivated people.
unlike some ofthe orher people" he’s
encountered in some ofhis past work
experiences. Klaersch claims that the
cabinet members are all “fun people

“7211, ha} not Sheik, hat that damn} mean that SGA president Petar Klactsth ’00 daem’t have anything

that are good at their jobs and can
get things done, making my job in
relation ro them easy."

Klaetseh thinks that most of his
hobbies are prettyrun ofrhe mill, but
the one really interesting thing that
he likes to do is to take “decent break
trips." For instance, last spring break,
he drove all the way to San Francisco,
albeit making several stops along rhe
way. Klactsch talks about driving
acrossrheRockyMountains in Colo-
rado as being a bread‘ltakingjaurney:
“driving on the interstate, and then it
suddenly opens up into this vast,
wide, open expanse . . , completely
incredible." The other place rhar
Klaetsch seems amazed by is Dead
Horse Point state Park in utah. He
says that it is "seemingly as deep as
the Grand Canyon,” and derives its
name from the fact mat it used ro be
a corral for horses where the cowboys
dross the ones theywanted, and then
left the remaining horses to die.

Klaetseh also plays competitive
basketball, and whilst refusing to say
exactly how good he is, admits to be-
ing able to “whoop up on your aver.
age fourrh grader."

Klaersch has two main aspirations

in life, saying, “l'vc been told that
theyre mutually exclusive, but I'm not
sure . , . I hope not though." The ﬁrst
is that he wants to have a perfecr fam.
ily. “I want to be able to love my vvife
more than anyone and I want my kids
to be the rnosr important part of my
life." The second is that he “wants to
make enough money to have a truly
positive inﬂuence, for a community
greater than just my Family."

Passionate and dedicated, Klactsch
holds theviewthat ”some people mighr
say there is apathy at Grinnell, but I
don’t think that is the ease. I thinksrue
dents at Grinnell are lust so involved
that they sometimes miss out on the
things that others do llere.”

l<laetseh mm: the SGA to “not be
seen as a clique, but to make it truly
representative to the level where people
feel completely at ease talking to us."
Klactsch views the SGA as an agency
that helps other organizations contrib.
ute to campus, rather than just being
another organization in itself. The SGA
serves as a sounding board, a resouree
and as a provider and administer of
funding, and he expresses hopes that it
will bring continued positive contribu-
tions to campus.

Jazz piano fills South Lounge. A
man plays, face intent on the keys, lips
parted. His right foot raps die rhythm
animatedly, His hair is 'gray.whire and
his jacket appears too large for him.
He begins to flirt with the audience.
His face remains intent on the keys
but his whole right leg pivots toward
them as it taps the rhythm.

Then he smiles at me audience. He
begins to watch them, turning crotch-
ety and disturbed, the wrinkles show»
ing around his eyes. it becomes clear
that he is playing with them.

He returns to neutral position,
hunches over, slits his eyes, and focuses
completely on the piano.

Then as the song ends he looks out
again, softening, his gaze gentlerasthe
her people file in. When he rises from
the piano and begins to read it is one
clear whether his voice lends richness
to his words or his words lend rich-
ness to his voice. '

cuest Professor Frank conroy is
the nationally bestselling author of
Stop-Time, a memoir; Midair, a col.
lection ofshorr fiction; and Body and

that he had

After four

“had to

alized ﬁnally. “I used novelistic tech-
niqucs to write a book in which 1 did
not make things up. I told it as 1 re-
membered it happening," he said.
Conroy was 25 when he began Stops

as big as barnes and Noble, but
they've got really good books and
good selection."

The Mall

“its one of the smaller malls in
the area, but it‘s bigger than any»
thing here," said Jamal Rogers. Al.
though not large, it does boasr most
mall standards, ineluding a
eineplex, music store, restaurants
and department stores.

Ped Mall

An outdoor pedestrian mall, the
ped mall is usually densely popu-
lated with University of lowa stu—
dents. it sports a number of shop.
ping options, including a toy store,
a tobacconisr, several bars and the
infamous Hall Mall.

Hall Mall

The Hall Mall is lust that — sev-
eral small stores, located along a hall-.
way upstairs from rhe Ped Mall. A
genuine youth enclave, the hall mall
sports several hippie stores that sell
used clothes, hemp products, and
“tobacco use only" smoking prod-
uers. in addition, the Hall Mail has
several kitschier stores. ”You can ger
your ear pierced then go buy some
sseM stuff," said Rogers of the
leather store and the piercing/tattoo
parlor.

Electric Head

The Hall Mall’s Electric Head is
the source of many tattoos and
piercings on campus. Well known
for skin artist stingray and piercing
expert Bob, they offer a variety of
services at standard prices. “They’re
very knowledgeable, I was very in
pressed . . . they have their s*“r
clown" said Jen l<niff ’99,

Adult Pleasure Palace .

A frequently visited but rarely
discussed venue, The Adult Pleasure
Palace is located outside of Iowa
City's downtown. “I recommend it
because it’s a very cultural place to
explore your sexuality,” said one
sophomore who asked to remain
unnamed. With merchandise in-
cluding liquid latex, ﬂavored lubri-
cant, vibrators and pornographic
movies and magazines, the Palace
caters to mature clientele.

After writing Midair, he became di-
rector ofthe lowa Writers" Workshop.

While at the lowa Writers" Work—
shop he wrore Body (IndSitul, his novel
about a jazz pianist, Body andSoalhas
been translated into twelve languages.
The French granred him knighthood.

Conroy advised studenrs interested
in becoming writers to write two hours
every day at a set time. They should
hold these two hours sacred and not
allow anything to break into them.

Even when they ﬁnd themselves
blocked, they should sit and experi-
ence it, They should write six days a
week.

“lfyou write two pages a day then
in a year you'll have a novel, ifyou can
write a novel,” he said. Finally he ad.
vised rhem not to allow weak work to
discourage them since “everybody does
weak work once in a while."

In his special topic he hopes to
“save {students} time by showing that
there is a relationship between writer
and reader that they must honor. The
reader is involved in the creation of
any work ofarr."
