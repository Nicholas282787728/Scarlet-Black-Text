By Amy Anderson

S part of AIDS awareness
week, the campus AIDS
response group soldT-shins

at the dining halls that stated various
situations for useofa condom. Spon-
sored by Grinnellians Escalating
AIDS Response (GEAR), this was
one of the activities to educate the
student body about the necessity of
condom use in prevention of AIDS.
On Friday in the postoffice, they sold
condoms attached to suckers, and
they will be passing out condoms at
their Harris party Friday night. On
Thursday they hosted a study break,
showinga video abouttheAIDS quilt
and playedan AIDS awareness game.

Signs around campus stating
Center for Disease Control statistics

about the disease and their fast-sell-
ing T~shirts, fourteen of which were
left Thursday night out of 150 pur-
chased, seem to be the groups but
educational tools. John Wannager,
corfoundcr of the organization,
described the signs as “statistics
and phrases that get people think-

Despite their inactivity last se-
mester, the group plans to increase
condom accessibility on campus. One
goal for later this semester is to get
morc condom machines installed at
various locations,such as Harris Cen

batltrooms. The laundry rooms “are
too hot- the heat isn't good for the
condoms,” and the laundry rooms
“aren’t always convenient," said
Wannager, Another future goal is to

The Free Cafe is the brainchild

of Becky Meyer and Tom Zlabingcr.
It’s a traveling cafe, going to differ-
ent dorms each week. “Free is tun
completely off donated time and
