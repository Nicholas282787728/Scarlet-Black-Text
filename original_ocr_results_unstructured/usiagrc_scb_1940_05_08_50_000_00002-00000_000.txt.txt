0 WANTED: ACTION!

Last week, in an open letter addressed to
the officers of the men’s halls, the Scarlet
and Black somewhat timidly suggested that
the preservation of our student governing
privileges demanded that those officers take
vigorous and immediate action to stem the
current eruption of vandalism upon the
campus

Unfortunately, in New of the weekend
outbreak of juvenile nihilism in the north—
ern-most men‘s halls, it appears that the
time for hesitant recommendation has
passed. Two-day water fights, broken fur-
niture, continuous light smashing, corridor
bonfires and a dozen odd broken windows
have transformed a hall problem into a
campus problem And as such, it entirely
merits the administrative action now under-
way.

As we plainly stated last Saturday,
whenever an existing government fails to
that another, stronger power intervene to
maintain adequate order, it is obligatory
that another, stronger power intervene to
restore administrative efficiency.

—G—

And that is precisely what has happened.
Whether the men’s own government in
the halls in question is unwilling or unable
to uphold decent living conditions is not for
lls to say. It may well be, as a sum singly
sympathetic opinion holds, that it is an in-
ability resulting from a two—year accumula-
tion of hall rotteness, rendering the situa-
tion beyond the control of those members
of the halls desiring the establishment of

can any social function, no matter

respectable conditions

But that does not excuse the fact that
this barbaric situation exists. Nor does it
alleviate the need [or outside action.

Fortunately, that action is available and
forthcoming Of course, this administrative
intervention will be denounced by the ir-
responsible as added proof that student
government at Grinnell is but a myth. But
few of those who will levy such charges will
realize the fundamental truth of their sar-
castic comments. For, so long as student
government assumes no more responsibility
that it has of late in the men‘s houses, so
long will that government remain a force.

But farce has no place in government.
Thus, the Scarlet and Black joins all men-
tally adult Grinnellians in welcoming and
supporting faculty and administrative inter-
vention to restore order in certain of the
men’s'halls.

Moreover, if that intervention is not to
result in a complete abandonment of men‘s
government, the officers of that govein-
ment must also welcome this action and be-
gin at once to execute the duties of their
position. There can be no other solution.
The doenothing, half-way measures of the
past have failed. And if they are continued,
the entire structure of student government
will fail with them. The men’s governing
bodies must ACT!and act now!

0 GOOD LUCK, COACH PARKS

Coaching with ,victory as the sole aim is so
much the prevailing type that it evokes no
particular comment. But the kind of coach-
ing which integrates a desire for victory
with a stress upon the vallle of the sport
to the participants is of a rarer sort.

It_is for this reason that the Scarlet and
Black joins with the entire college in com-
mending Coach Parks i'or his fine work
this year. After finishing an excellent job
in coaching freshman football, he enabled
the swimming team, made up mostly of
inexperienced sophomores, to finish higher
in the conference standings than any sport
so far this yea His tennis team looks
like a cinch for first place in the conference
standings. More important than this, how—
ever, was the fact that he kept the interests
of his team members above his interest in
winning

He has also done fine work Olrthe men’s
intramural program He introduced bowl-
ing as a dormitory intramural sport. His
ping pong tournament was a great success.
Attracting over sixty entrants, it was run
off with excellent precision. The new bad—
minton mixed doubles tourney, another suc—
cessful innovation, attracted faculty and
students alike. He also introduced a dormi-
tory bridge tournament, and his horseshoe
tournament is now in progress

It was for the good ol' the athletic clef
pal-tlnent as a whole that the changes were
made in the coaching staff, and Mr. Parks
was the victim of the circumstances. Thus,
we join with all Grinnell in wishing Coach
Parks the best of luck in his new position.

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor:

The social committee on the cal-
endar has always stressed to or-
gauizations that arrangements for
a date on said calendar be made
{at in advance in order that there
will be no conflicts. Why doesn’t
the committee adhere to the pol-
icy it advises?

Women's Honor “G" has run in-
to a snag more insurmountable
than a gym fireia ”dlbbled” up
date, On February 7 the organi-
zation reserved the evening of
May 17 for a pavement dance,
open to the entire college. A pave-
merit dance is something new in
the campus social life, and a great
deal of planning and work has ale
ready been completed. However,
on April 29, the registrar's office
informed Women's Honor. “G”
that a houseparty was also to be
held the night of May 17. How

how new and refreshing, success—
fully buck a, hollseparty? of
course, only a hundred or so pros»
pective couples would be taken
away from the pavement (lance.

We don’t want to go down in
the annals of Gnunellpi-ostoricy as
soreheads, and we hold nothing
against the dorms in general and
the hollscparty group in particu-
lar, Vlhat we do protest, however,
is the social committee’s attitude
toward its own prescribed policy.
Why should organizations be
asked to arrange for dates early,
to the convenience of the social
committee, when the date may be
divided later on among other
functions?

Last fall Women's Honor “G"
turned over all Fire Bawl pres
needs to the new gym fund, al-
though It owes the college a debt
for the Honor “G” cabin. This
cabin is not a private project, but
available to all quadrangle women.

The organization is trying to pay

knows, by sponsoring affairs such
as the planned pavement dance.

We withdraw from our niche on
May 17 calendar. There's no use
carrying- on whon the majority of
interested couples will be attend-
ing a formal witll a name bantlr

In the past, women's athletic or»
gcnizollcns have changed their
plans when learning they had not
made calendar arrangements early
enough, and would be competing
wiLh an already dated function.
What good is this concession to
priority right?

We leave the (late of May 17
open to whatever other arrange-
ments the social committee has
made. However, we hope that
proper changes will be made in
order that campus organizations
Will not run into hkc situations in
the future.

If organizations cooperate with
the social committed by booking
their dates early, such foresight
should be a guarantee that con-

FAN MAIL: The following letter
was received yesterday morning,
and we pass it on to you for
what it’s worth.

Deal- Doric.

I, too, waited for Zephyr to
come out. Not just to read the
old rag, but to see if they pub-
lished that list of names of
babes that might go steady.
Every night before going to
bed I said a prayer that they
would come through, but look
what happened, they just made
fun of me. Doric, maybe you
would help me out, gee, 1 get
lonesomer and loncsomer every
day. Surely there must be some
little cutie I could go with. 1
know 1 don't have anything on
the ball and surely i can't be
classed with those Dibble Adon-
ises (thank God), but please,
Doric, help me gel just one
date before I leave Grimell.
