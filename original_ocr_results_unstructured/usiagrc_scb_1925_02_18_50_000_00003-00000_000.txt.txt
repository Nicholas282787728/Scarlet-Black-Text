CZECIIO-SLOVAKIA.

The American ohiection to a hyphen-
ated citizenship does not hold
among the Sloi-aks in Czecbo-Sluvak-
ia. They are protesting against ttie
threatened removal ol the hyphen
from the official title of their Lam—
posite state, which they regard as an»
other insidious more by the Czech
senior partner to gobble the goodwill
n! the firm. The Slm‘aks are remind-
int; the Czechs that when the two
partners made their contract of tissue
elation in 1315, there was a secret
agreement that after ten years the
Sluvalis might, if they wished, dissolve
the partnership and establish an inde—
pendent Slovak state. Meanwhile the
hyphen is dear to them as a symbol
of equality. This little incident may
remind us that all is not lovely even
in the most prosperous of the "succes—
sion states” lniilt out or the wreckage
or the Austro-ilungarian Empire, and
that the thirst for sellrdetermillotioll
still burns in ardently particular lstic
breasts.

Anyone who knew the inextricable
tangles of nationalities in central Eu—
rope could have predicted that com-
plete Selfrdeterml‘nstiml was a politi«
cal mirage. The new states created
‘after the war are and had to he as tru-
ly composite as those that were de-
stroyed. One of them rejoices in the
tellztale official title “Kingdom or the
Serbs, Croats and Slovelles," and from
its creation has been torn by hitter in.

has been less auarrelsoinc, but is no
less composite, being made up or four
distinct geographical and political
elements.

Bohemia (which calls itsclt_C,zeehyl
has almost seven million inhabitants,
more than a third of them German: it
has half the total population or the
new state, and the great bulk of its
rural resources. It stond iii-st among
the provinces oi Austria in industry
and is one of the most prosperous and
highly cultivated regions in Europe,
with an admirable school system and
practically no illiteracy. John l-llis.
Comenius, Dvorak, Kuholik, and Ca-

the war had to employ Bohemian

‘scboolmasters to establish an educa-
’tloual system in Slovakia in the saint,

way, efficient public seri ce demanded
the importation of Bohemian oliicials.
To the ignorant Slovaks, suspicious as

vlong downtrodden people always are,

this unavoidable measu , seemed to
threaten the ovorll'helmlug or their
native language and customs by the
more clever and sophisticated Czechs.
Hence the excitement over the appar»
ently trivial incident oi the hyphen,

Rnssinia is another story. This tag
and or creation has a population ol
600,000, living along the southern
slope of the Carpathians, separated by
this range from their tclloiwuhroilr
ions (or Little Russians) of Galle—
in and Eukowim. 'nioy nlm-ed i
the Slovaks the doubtful blessings oi
Hungarian rule, which leit them a
backward and illiterate peasantry,
povertyzstricken and ridden by the ty~
ranny or money-lenders. Given auto-
nomy by the elder statcsmen who
fashioned the Treaty or Versailles,
they first accepted as their president
a young lawyer trom Pittsburgh who
had been dilly "elected" by the Ruse
siiiiaus at that city, than votcd tore
many for incorporation in the Czechos
Slovak state, still retaining, however,
a certain semblance of autonomous
government.

These tour sections unite to toriu a
shoestring state, lion miles long and
30 to its miles wide, with an area
equal to that of Iowa but six times its
population. Five million or this poll»
ulation, mostly Germans and Hungar-
iuus, are alien to tho Who-Sic
stock, This means a dangerously
largo irrcdentist element, incompar-
ahlr larger relatively than were A]
sacc-Lo ants in Germany and tho
ltalian province. in Austria.

Nevertheless Czeclio-slovallia is the
stablesi and the most prosperous ot
the new political units created by the
results or the war, This is due large
ly to the fact that the two ablest con»
sti-uctive statesmen or the post-war
period are Czech

Thomas Masaryk, born
1350, son of a Moravian coachman and
a German peasant woman, loeksnuth's
apprentice, private teacher, Protessor
of Philosophy, journalist; legislator,
political tugitiyc, was through many
years the toremost inspircr or Czech
national sentiment, and when the end
ot the war brought liberation to his
people, he was nnaniinonsly elected
their first President toi- life. ‘ The
quality or his spirit is clearly revealed
hy his nroiession of political faith:
“What is needed is an inner renovar
tion, without which there is no mean—
ing in political liberty. What is need—
cd is an active love tor our neighhors,
without which there is no true patri-
otism. What is needed is to love, to
seek and to uphold the truth. What
is needed is to cstahlish public life,
upon the basis oi morality and truth "

Eduard Belles, born 1884, son or a
Bohemian peasant, student under
Masaryk at Prague, and by his advice
doing ginduate work in France, he-
came Professor or Political Economy
in Fragile, was active in the Czech
movement for independence, helped
Masaryk organize the Czech Legion
during the war, and persuaded the al-
