tee in the campaign 0r. nuggun said:
“A movement in favor oi exalting
the work or Mr. Wilson will appeal

cators generally. Mr. Wilson m

, a teacher

oral thought, or peace through jus.‘

almost up to the tune
jlie heroine Pl‘eSldent, and he did not
stop his teaching even then. I think
even his hitter enemies will admit that
his explanation or the ideals of the
Allies during the war was probably
more potent than any other inllnence
in keeping up the morale of the tight-
ing allied people during the war. _
