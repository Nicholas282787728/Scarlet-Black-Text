Once More .. PLEASE? I -

Let it be known at the beginning that
this is not a gripe. It is an earnest request.
The administration has heard it before
and has heeded it as ably as means per
mitted. We are not being facetious. This
is not “the old White House question."
But we do feel there is a need, as there
always has been, for some place on the
west side of the campus where students
can relax and enjoy a cigarette and so-
ciable companionship now and then.

The need is particularly urgent right
noi There aren’t the extracurricular ac-
tivities to bring- different groups together
that there used to be. The old interest
in society with others is decidedly ape,
thetic if the indifference displayed at a
recent housemeeting over a proposed cot-
tag party is any example, A means for
an individual, voluntary expression of so-
ciability outside one’s clique is necessary.

Location is an important factor for
consideration Since one of the nearby
town establishments has closed, and the
one remaining was not built for comfort,
there is no place within a reasonable dis-
tance to provide even the most meager
recreation facilities students desire. The
Rec room has provided ample faci ties for
cokes and refreshment, particularly after
hours. It has not been inhabited during
the day only because of its inconvenient
location.

Part of at least two buildings, if made
available, would serve the purposes sug-
gested. The southwest room of the Y
building with its fireplace, should prove
extremely comfortable. Classes held there
might be moved to one of the rooms in
Pioneer Hall. Should the Y building room
not be accessible—its being next door to
an office of faculty members may create
a new problemia room in Pioneer hall,
converted to the purpose of recreation,
would be altogether satisfactory.

The above suggestions have been boldly
thrown out in the hopes that the purpose
of the request is evident in itself. We are
sincere in the hope of their realization.

Victorious lsolaiionism - -

Rgardless of what the Wisconsin voters
really meant by their votes in the pri-
maries spokesmen for the “isolationist” or
so-called nationalist school of thought are
intelpreting it as a rejection of Mr. Will—
kle’s principles, but those of President

Catherine Funk ,

 

Roosevelt as well.

Back in 1919, the Republicans started
out uitll an abstract approval of the
League of Nations but with reservations,
and Warren Harding made the 1920 race
\lithout sa ing uhcthcr or not he would
favor Allie lll entry into the Lea le.
Finally, after the election, the Republ an
presidentselect_repudiatcd the international
cooperation by means of the League and
thereafter America retreated into isolationr
lsm,

Will history repeat itself“.7 Already the
iepublicans .al‘e cllaracteruing the View
of both Willkie and Roosevelt as extreme
intornatiol‘talism. _

This is but another nay of indicating

.that something less than uhat ollr gov-‘
ernment today is adopting as its policiesi

of cooperation is considered a desirable
foreign policy by prominent Republicans.
An interesting comment on the Willkie
defeat is found in the New York Daily
News whose comment often parallels that
ol‘ the Chicago Tribune.
1 quote the News: “It was not \Villkie

the noble and lovable gentleman who was’

defeated in that (the Wisconsin) primary.
It was Willkie the politician and his in-

ternationalist principles.
“He made those principles the issue
when the showdown came, the

Wisconsin G. O. P. voters snowed thesei

principles under. The episode goes to show
once more that the talkative fraction of
the American peopleithe fraction which
includes most newspapers and radio corn—
mentators and most movie producers—is
far more internationally minded than the
nonetalkative mass of the people.

“The mass of the people just do not
like to have 10,000,000 or more of their
sons, fathers, husbands, and brothers
hauled into the armed services and sent
over to fight. The Four Freedoms and the
Atlantic Charter are a. couple of abstrac-
tions to these matter—of—fact Americans.
They haven't been sold, either, on the idea
that this is purely a defensive war. As
to Japan it is . . . .

“But immediately after Pearl Harbor
our ruler decided that the best way to
defend ourselves against Japan was to
throw our main weight against Germany.
That decision has never yet set well with
most Americans, as we understand their
reactions.

“Germany was no immediate threat to
us, because Germany was too busy with
Britain and Russia. Had Gelmany beaten
them, it might later have become a threat
to us. But in this war, the popular Amer—
ican belief is that we are fighting Germany
primarily to defend the British Empire;
and most Americans don’t like that.”

It is hard to believe that any article
similar to the above could be printed and
read by all intelligent people, but this is
an accurate expression of isolationist and
nationalist doctrine and the Daily News
insists that Governor Dewey now adopt it
as the program and policy of the Republi—
can party in the event that he should be
the nominee and be elected President. Mr.
Willkie is advised to “return to his first
and longest love, the Democratic party."

The question, however, that troubles
some of the more internationally minded
Republicans who do not agree with the
foregoing viewpoint is: if this is the mean-
ing of the Wisconsin primary, how many
independent voters and how many former
Democrats and Republicans will find that
perhaps they, too, had better go over to
the Democratic party.
