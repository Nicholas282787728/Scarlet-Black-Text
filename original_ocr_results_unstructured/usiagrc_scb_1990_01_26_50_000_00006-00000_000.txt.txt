Social Activism

Where were you during break? Were you lounging
poolside in a warm, sunny climate? Were you enjoying
the windy slopes of a ski resort? Were you playing
couch potato, following only the latest happenings on
the football field? Or were you one of the 35 people
involved in the Alternative Break Program (see page 5),
dedicating your time to people who truly needed it?

The Alternative Break Program is just one of the
growing efforts on the part of Grinnellians to encourage
social awareness and responsibility. Thanks to the
efforts put forth by students, the Town and Gown
campaign has made considerable progress in bettering
relationships between the college and the community.
Thanks to Grinnellians, children who might not
otherwise have received gifts donated through SGA‘s
Toy Drive. Thanks to Grinnellians, the CSC is able to
provide many helpful volunteers for various services
throughout the community and surrounding areas.

Yes, we do bristle when we are not obliged with such
comforts as single dorm rooms at a higher educational
institution with a $16,000 tuition fee, but the efforts
shown by students like Kent Koth and other volunteers
prove that, yes, we are concerned, caring people who
have a sincere interest in the future that lies ahead.

ISRAEL. Palestinian activrst Faisal al-Htrssain, who was
imprisonedby Israeli authoritieson suspicion of promoting
violence. has been released. Hussain claims his
imprisonmentwas politically motivated. Israeli author-ides
have said they will continue watching him.

ENGLAND. Aberring
scandal which could
make the Pore Rose
affair look insigniﬁcant
has hit the English
Division 11 soccer team.
Swindon Town.

The controversy
surrounds an FA Cup
game that Swindon.
currently near the top
of their division. plade
at Newcaslle United in
1988, losing 5—0. The club chairman Brian Hillier and its
former manager, Lou Macari (one of the best midﬁelders
in British—soccer history). are alleged to havcbct £6500 on
their'team to lose the game. The case looks particularly
suspect given that. although Swindon was expected to
lose, almost nobody expected drcteam tobebadly beaten.
The invesrigation has been expanded to cover “irregular
payments" to players. '

Meanwhile. a senior club ofﬁcer has been ﬁred and
another has resigned. Both were angered by the refusal by
other board members to give evidence which would
endanger Hillier and Macari. —

Macari and Hillier face a lifetime ban from the game,
though, in this situation. it is not mandatory.

EUROPE. A row over the European Social Charter is
isolating the British government from the other eleven
members of die European Community (BC). The split is
occurring over the intention of the European Commission.

state that is strongly opposing this proposal.

of anyone to choose whether or not to join a trade union,
has been frequently attacked by Ithi-itish governrncnton

Mr. Eddie Nginilla‘s ar-
ticle in the last issue of the Scarlet
andBlark. while good of inrention.
seemed unfairly one sided in its
characterization. While dialogue
certainly is the only possiblcpeace-
ful solution to the currentproblems
in the Middle East, itis nota manor
of simple unreasonable stubborn-
ness. Mr. Nginilla seems to be
poorly informed on several impor-
tant points: .

I) Yes. Shamir did indeed blow
up the King David Howl in Jerusa—
lem while it was under British rule.
However. at the Limo the hotel was
being used by the British Military
and was a military target. While
there were some isolated incidents

killed at that time. mosttargetswcre

level it did in the PLO’s cmrrer.

This policy has been brought to
bearmany times in the past20years,
in such places as the Munich Olym-
pics in 1W2 where the Israeli team
was massacred. and in Ma’alor in
1974 where a group of school chil-
dren was murdered in cold blood.

2) While Arafat has indeed said
that the PLO rcnounccs terrorism,
the governing body of the PLO has
refused to repeal, or even amend.
rhe PLO's Charter in regard to Isr-
rorism and it's stance on Israel. It
has declared that Arafat was Speakr
ing only for himselfmnd thatho has
no right or power to repeal the
charter without their approval.
Thus, as a matter of law, the PLO's
goal of the destruction of the State
of Israel is still a reality.

3) While the PLO has claimed to
have refonnedand Iodesirc to form
adcmocratic stare,rlrey haveopcnly

I agree that people will have to.
each in turn. cometopcare with the
wrongs committed against Lhem
before there can be any real lasting
peace in the Middle East. Mr.‘
Nginilla, however, should under—
stand that in the Middle East good
guys wearing white hats are rare.
most people just wear a variety of
trays?
