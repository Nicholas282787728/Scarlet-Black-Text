were Rowe 7 263 votes. Julia McCray
e 235 Votes. writerins ~ 22 votes. The
write»ins were declared invalid.

After last week's election. which no
one won because the number of write-
ins prevented either candidate from
capturing a majority. Rowe went
before the Judicial Council, In response
to his request for an interpretation ol
the election guidelines, Judicial Council
ruled that the results of the election
must stand because Election Board
Chairman Rob Schwartz's inclusion of
a writerln blank on the ballot indicated
that he had interpreted write lns as be
ing valid votes in the election

However the Council also ruled that
'only ballots cast for the official cane
'didates would be valid in any further
runoiis. This ruling was applied to the
election last Wednesday and will be

upheld until it is overruled by a future
Judicial Council or the election
guidelines are changed.

Both Rowe and SGA President Paul
Volker indicated that they intend to

» work on getting the guidelines changed

before the SGA elections in me spring,
“We‘re not certain what form the
changes will take. yet.” said Volker.
“Actually I'm just happy to get these
elections over with."

Rowe saw his election as an indicav
tion that students would like to see
more “outside" views represented in
SGA. “Julia (McCray. who is currently
administrative assistant) already has a
cabinet post; she would just be moving
around. I hope to be able to replace
.iohn Conyeis in bringing noneSGA
views into the cabinet. I think the posi-
tion of Vice-president is a checks and
balances sort of thing,” he pointed out.

When asked whether he foresaw any
problems working wiui McCray on the
cabinet. Rowe replied," I don't think
there will be any problems. Throughv '
out the campaign we‘ve never been
enemies. And even though most of the
cabinet supported Julia, 1 received a
warm reception right alter i was
elected. I think that we'll all work well
together. "
