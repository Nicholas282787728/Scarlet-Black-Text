Man in Moon Searches for Mate

By MARGUERITE KONECNY

The annual May festival given by
the women's physical education de-
partment May 13 on the center cam-
pus will have a theme of fantasy this
year.

The Man in the Moon who has
lived alone since the beginning of
time longs for a companion. He de—
scends to the earth to select the
fairest maiden there for his wife. Ar-
riving first in Japan. he finds him—
self in the midst of a festival in hon-
or of the bctrothal of the princess
and he watches a colorful feast of
the lanterns. However, he sees no
maid worthy of his love so he returns
to his crescent-shaped abode.

l Visits Gretel

His second journey takes him into
an old Dutch garden. Here jolly
gardeners plant their tulips while
their employers, the three prim sis-
ters, Prim, Prue, and Priss, watch
them. Gretel, their niece, enters, her
head buried in her “Gentle Reader."
She is unhappy under the inhibitions
placed upon her by her straight-
laced aunts.

When she is left alone for
la moment she hears gay music
which proves to be from a gay
Harlequin and his band of revele!
Thcy inveigle her into their dance,
give her a costume, and she goes out
into the world with them, However,
she soon returns, disillusioned, fol-
lowed by Harlequin. The Man in the
Moon tries to win Gretel from him,
but she rejects them both,

Scotland Next Scene

The traveler then goes to bonny
Scotland where in the midst of a
dance by their companions, two high-
landers from rival clans cross swords
for the love of a pretty lassie. He
passes on to a gypsy camp where he
finds a merry scene. Two of the tribe
