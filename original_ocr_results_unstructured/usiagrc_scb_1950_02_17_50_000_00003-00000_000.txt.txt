A Happy Sui-prise

.. ing, then think. Thinking is

you attack your educationall
tasks.

Successful study depends both
on the ability to do college work
and upon serious application.
Granted that the student has
these, there remains a third
very important factor, that of,
an adequate study technique.
Granting both ability and seri»
aus purpose the following sug-
gestions may be helpful in im-
proving methods of study:

1. Mere reading is not study-
ing, even though one reads his
lessons four or five times. In
reading, the mind is relatively
passive. One follows the words
on a page, perhaps not evenl
comprehending what he is read-
ing. Study requires an active
mind. Look away from your
book, criticize, analyze, reviewl
in your own words, organize
the material and integrate it

with What you have already
learned.

2. Underscoring is often help~
ful, but too often much is un-
derlined. Even so, this does not
result in much increase of
mental activity.

3. Outlining is often helpful,
but be careful of transfering
material passively to paper and
feeling virtuous about having
“studied."

4. Learn how to take lecture
notes. Don’t Write down every-
thing, Note the main points of
the lecturer and some of the
subsidiary points under each.
Avoid doing it mechanically.
Review and reorganize the notes
before they become cold.

5. Space your study time.
Most students study the night
before. An hour spent on Mon-
day ancl an hour in review on
Tuesday will see you better
prepared on Wednesday than
two hours on Tuesday.

6. Review your work metho-
dically to avoid histerical cram-
ming,

7. Reeite to yourself. After
studying your lesson, determine
the essential aspects by asking
yourself “just what was this
lesson about?" "

a. Test yourself by closing
your book and answering your
own questions on paper,

9. Prepare according to test
, method. Note the type of ques-
tions used by your instructor,
and prepare accordingly.

lo. Concentrate. When you
study attempt seriously to put
everything else out of your
mind, Don’t “put in time.“

11. Read for understanding

not just “in order to recite." '

Get the main ideas; the details

will then be easy. By spacing .

your studyyctu may devote your
first reading to pleasurable
curiosity. They to get perspec—
tive, a comprehensive view. The
uetails will cluster as ”iron fil-
lings to a magnet" if you grasp
your assignment as a whole.

12, Get materials for think-

largely the manipulation of facts
and concepts. You can't think
without them, And if you don’t
have them clearly in your

only ones."

"Why must professors talk so
fast that one can't take notes?”
”I hate ambiguous test questions
when only one answer is ac—
ccptable,"

“Learning a professor‘s bios
graphy instead of hearing a
lecture bores me."

“I am disturbed when an inn
structor gives his lecture to
the wall or the window instead
of to the class."

“Teachers shouldn’t ask if
there are questions and then
say, ‘That should be understood,’
when some one does want a
point explained.”

Other Jockeys

Other students jockeying the

Bob Pilkington, student director
of the station.

l-ligh points in this week‘s
live show parade was the KGRW
adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe’s
immortal “Fall of the House of
Usher.” Feature players Bob
Pilklngton, Caroline Leinhaus-
er, and Raoul Hurd carried
through admirably to a sound-

this medium of entertainment is
rapidly on the way to becoming
one of the most important on
the campus We would like to
think that the live show end of
the Grinnell’s radio outlet will
expand further.
