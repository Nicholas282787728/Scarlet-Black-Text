Stop ratiﬁcation
of CAFTA

Now that the presidential elections are over
it is time to turn our attention back to issues that
have been neglected in the pre—election fervor.
One such issue is the U.S.-Central American
Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which will
likely be presented soon to the House and Sen
ate for ratiﬁcation. CAFTA is a multj—lateml free
trade agreement between the US and Hondu-
ms, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa
Rica and the Dominican Republic. Negotiations
ended last January and CAFTA is expected to
be ratiﬁed by the us. congress in a lame duck
session before the end of the current legislative
session.

The North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) can serve as an important model for
predicting the results of CAFTA in central
America and the us. Since the implementation
of NAFTA, according to CISPES, the United
States has lost a total of 879,280 jobs, most of
which were high—paid manufacturing jobs lost
due to outsouicing. In Mexico, 1.5 million small
farmers have gone bankrupt m the last 10 years,
many as a result of the inability of these farms
ers to compete with multinational subsidized
agricultural firms from the U.S. Currently in the
U.S., three agribusinesses control 32 percent of
are world gmin trade; so CAFTA will not even
beneﬁt small farmers in the Us. because they
do not have access to the international market.

Since the signing ofNAFTA,\7\/al-Marr has her
come the largest employer in Mexico and 23,000
small Mexican businesses have been forced to
close down.

If CAFTA is ratiﬁed and implemented,
many or the problems facing Mexico, Canada
and the US. as a result of NAFTA will be reps
heated on a larger scale. CAP TA does not have
adequate provisions for protecting agricultural
sectors and will favor largerscale agribusiness
instead of smaller farmers. CAFTA will also
threaten the participating countries’ ability to
govern themselves by including provisions, like
that of NAFTA's Chapter 11, which allow cot-
porations to file law suits against governments
for labor and environmental laws, by claiming
they impede trade. On Oct. 12, social move—
ments across Central American joined together
to oppose CAFTA. in Costa Rica 30,000 people
participated in protests; in Guatemala the total
was 20,000; in El Salvador there were over 7,000
people participating.

Now it is our turn as U.S. citirens to support
the struggle against CAFTA. We, as the Latin
American Solidarity Group, urge students, pron
fessors and the rest of the Grinnell community to
contact theil legislators and re urge dicm to vore
against the ratiﬁcation of CAFTA. The Grinnell
Representative in the House is Leonard Boswell,
and his number is 202722573806. For more ins
formation about CAFTA and our efforts please
contact LASG by e—mailing [americns] or com-
ing to a meeting (Monday's at 9 pm in the For
rurn Coﬁee House).

Keep up the ﬁght

Dear Editor,

Needless to say this is not all most ofus hoped
for. We hoped that America would reject Bush
and the right wing but it was not to be. The next
four years are going to be hell, no doubt about
that. But giving up, going home and burying our
heads in the sand is not the Grinnell way. No, the
Grinnell way, and indeed the American way, is to
light like hell, no matter the odds. Still, you made
a diﬂ’erence, State Senator elect Reillywas elected
because of you and because of you, Poweshiek
county went for Kerry by so votes. My fellow
Grinnellians, this is but a battle in a long war and
I have no doubt that at the end ofthe day, we will
come out victorious, but only ifwc don't give up.
stay involved, keep fighting and always do what
is right.

Clarifying Grinnell
train service

Dear Ms. Aha:

I read your article about “Trains in Grinnell"
in the October 29 issue ofthe SUB and feel that
I must comment. I am having a little trouble with
your statement regarding the demise of passenr
get trafﬁc and its relationship to the campus riots
of 1970.

Although there might be some very remote

validity to this on the local level, the riots were
not a cause for the elimination of railroad pas-
senger service. Passenger service on All US,
railroads had been in decline for at least two def
cades before the birth ofArntrak in 1972.Trafﬂc
declined as a result of the increasing popularity
of air travel and the spread of the interstate high-
way system. By the late 19605 the federal gov:
emment became involved in doing something
to keep some sort of passenger system alive and
thus Amtrak ms born in 1972.

During the 1960s the only way milroads
could drop a train from their roster ms to peti»
tion the Federal government to do soflhis was
not an easy practice as it could take months or
even years to complete but as the 60’s wore on,
it became almost an everyday event. There are
provisions in the timetable for acts ofwar but the
campus riots of 1970 hardly fit the procedures
in that part of the timetable and tariff Finally,
there were schedules and connections to meet,
If there were a particular problem in Grinnell
for instance, the railroad would detour trains
over other routes, a practice that they still con—
tinueThc heated part of the 1970 riots was over
a tworweek period in which it is possible that
service could have been altered but the riots had
nothing to do with the elimination of passenger
service] lived near two class I railroads in 1970
both of which were running several passenger
trains a day, The campus riots did not aEect
those trains at all.

Dining hall must change

After my first meal at Grinnell,1 thought: "I
don't know what people are complaining about. The
food here is not that bad,"1 maintained this view
for no more than two days when i realized that after
each meal I became ill From my experience eat—
ing frozen corn, uncooked beans and undercooked
meat 1 concluded that dining services must not use
sanitary techniques for food preparation After talk-
ing to other students,] realized that I was not alone.
All of my friends stem to havejust as unfortunate
digestive problems. Iwould not complain if the food
was just poor quality (even though dinner costs a
relatively high $11),-—it’s that I have had to miss two
classes due to food-related illnesses. When I went to
the health center, the nurse informed me that they
see many similar cases. Something in the dining hall
needs to change.

Running for president‘in ‘17

I’m turning 22 in a week and I'm thinking,
“What’s the big deal?" I already turned 16, 18, then
21, and I’m left wondering what special birthdays can
1 look forward to now I suppose i can look forward
to when I turn 26 because my birthday present will
be giving Bush the boot, but I was really hoping for
such a gift for this birthday. What, you sayI can rent
a car when I’m 25? Big frickin’ deal. I don’t frickin'
eater really think there should be more special age
limits on things, with ages like 35 (besides running
for president) so aging people will look forward to
getting older, and not the stinkin’ youth. You know
how they say “youth is wasted on the young"? it’s be
cause young people can't wnii to turn 21 so they can

drink!

A day at a time

I‘d like to take a’nioment and put this past week

.in perspective, because ifi don't, my sanity, and pose

sibly the sanity of others, will be in question. It’s'
been four years. Iwas a junior in high school when
the 303 first came to oﬁice, l’ni ajunior now, but in
four years, I’m going to be in “the real world." Pre-
paring to enter the real world means thinking about
“real" things: employment, housing, food, gasoline,
utility bills and taxes. I’ll have to do a lot of things,
but obsessing aboutBush is not one of them, That’s
not to say rliat politics doesn't matter, but rather that
it's only one part of one’s very complex life. Take a
shot in honor of a failed bid for the oval office, but
then turn your attention to more immediate matters-
-takc it a day at a time.
