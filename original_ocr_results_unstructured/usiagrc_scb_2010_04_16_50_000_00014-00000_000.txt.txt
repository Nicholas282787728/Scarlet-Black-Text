Sailing starts,

finishes season
on high note

in AARON SWANEY

Over the past two weekends the Grinnell Sailing Team
competed in two regattas, placing 11th out of 17 last weekend
at Northwestern University on Lake Michigan and taking sec
ond the weekend before at the University orowit on Lake Mcs
Bride. Undoubtedly, sailing on Lake Michigan was a complete
ly different experience from the small like just north orowa
City or Rock Creek State Park, where the team practices—but
that it is not to say the conditions had a negative impact.

“It was reallywindy on Saturday, and we were having to deal
with some really big swells," Kyle Walters ’12 said, “It was very
different bill because we were on Lake Michigan, we were in
more stable boats, With more rounded hulls, so we simply had
to adjust to the extremes between the tops and bottoms ofthe
swells,"

In fact, ifanything, the wind helped more than it hurt. “Ben
[Brewer '11, who serves as web editor {or the S653] and I are
a heavier team, so we go really slowly when there’s light wind
and faster when the winds are stronger,” \Valters said. “As SEIP
urday went on the winds were getting faster and we were plaCs
ing higher, but then they reached 16 knots and, for insurance
purposes. the rest ofthe races had to be canceled."

In addition to having to deal with the different conditions,
Halley Coplin '12, the boat partner of Jonah Ellinnn '12, was
unable to attend because ofillncss, forcing Jonah to sail with a
student from Northwestern.

“It definitely hurt a bit," Ellman said. “I would have gone
faster with Halley, since we've sailed together before and she’s a
better sailor than the girl who replaced her."

In spite of those setbacks, the team had a very positive outr
look on the weekend.

“Overall, we felt that we did really well, especially [consids
ering] Jonah was sailing with someone from Northwestern,"
Walters said. “We beat all the schools who we beat at Iowa, but
also beat Illinois who had finished first the weekend before.”

Those teams included the University of Indiana, the Uni—
versity of Iowa, the University of WisconsinrMilwaukee and
Northwestern University, among others. These were just the
first two regattas that Grinnell’s sailing team had ever officially

 

 

been invited to in their short history.

“We went to another regatta last semester, but were only
invited as a filler when another school dropped out, so [the
University orowa’s regatta] was our first time getting a formal
invite," Walters said. “It was cool to show up without anyone
knowing who we were and really make a name for ourselves by
coming in second to Illinois by only one point."

Ellmrln rind Brewer both hail from Chicagoland, while Co-
plin and Walters are both from the Northeast. But all had sail-
ing experience before coming to Grinnell.

“One of the best thing about the regattas was the sense of
camaraderie among the teams," Walters said. “I'm from the
East where people can be really mean on the water, but here

everyone was out there competing for themselvesjiist as mttch
as against one another.”

The main obstacle the team now faces is purchasing
some boats so that they can practice and teach sailing at Rock
Creek, but with such great results in their first regattas, it (3,, '
tainly seems like a red sky at night.

“We're working with [GORP director] Dave Zeiss
on getting some boats for the future. There’s growing inter—
est and some younger kids on campus who have had a lot of
experience. We're really looking forward to the future, and the
biggest issue right now is getting boats,” Ellman said. “I think
we could really have a lot offun and be a pretty good team in
the Midwest.”

Ultimate teams prepare for sectionals, regionals

The days are getting nicer and spring fashion is in full efr
fect,which means at least two things: some students reveal their
muscle definition and Clevclandcrs finally get to acnially en-
joy a cigarette outside. After a Winter of training, the Grinnell
Men’s and Women's Ultimate teams have firmly established
themselves as a part of the former. ,

Their wrnter training, in addition to a stronger team men-
tality, not only contributed to the team’s great looking calves,
but to their most successful season ever. Over Spring Break,
the Grinnellephants, as the men’s team calls itself, won the
High Tide tournament in Savannah, Ga. It was their second
win this season. The women, known as rho Sticky-Tongued
Frogs, placed third.

“We’ve finished fifth and third in the past but we've always
had trouble playing through sunday and winning it all," said
Men's Corcaptain Torn Elliorr'll. “So this was an opportunity
for us because we saw the teams that we're there and we knew
we had a shot at doing really, really well and at the end of the
day we came out on top. Itwas a really incredible experience,"

Although the women ended up losing in the semifinal, it
was their highest finish ever at this tournament.

“We played pretty well and pretty consistently the whole
weekend which was nice," Christine Grummon ’11 said. “We
wish and felt like we could have done a little bit better in the
semiﬁnal game but overall the week went really well a lot of
fun."

The High Tide Tournament is one of the team’s most im»
portant tournaments of the year because it provides the team
with an opportunity to see teams that they wouldn‘t normally
compete against.

“It‘s a mixture of teams from around the country," said
Women's CorCaptain Hanna Liebl ’10. “Its generally really
good competition for us because here we play really big state
schools and we gct beat, so it was nice to play some smaller
schools."

Also, the structure and length of the tournament gives the
team plenty of chances to gain valuable game-time experience.
The first day includes a hat tournament,’ at non~competirive

kickroffin which players are put on random teams in order to
meet some of the other playersThe next two days are pool play
and the final day is bracket play.

“Especially with first-year players,you just get so much bet-
tcr,"Grummon said. “People got a lot ofplaying time you could
even just see it at the beginning ofone day to the end. People
get more confident and they make upfield looks where maybe
they might have given up the disc to a more experienced player
before. Playing that much frisbee everyonejust gets better field
sense."

However, the most exciting moment in the tournament
concerned just one familiar opponent. Tire University of
Wisconsin»Milwaukee (UWM) is Grinnell's unofficial rival,
although in past years the rivalry has been fairly one-sided. 1n
Elliot’s experience, neither teain had ever beaten the Blackcats,
as UWM team calls itself, although animosity was certainly
felt equally However, both teams were able to claim victory
over UWM,

“I've been here for three years and I’ve probably played
them eight or nine times and We've never beaten them," Elliott
said. “And we were up two at the very end [of the semiﬁnal
match] and then they brought it back to IZ-all game and we
punched the last one in. It was Andrew Otto [’10] throwing to
Glen Clark [’10] so it was two senIOISAgreat moment."

“Hate losing to that team. love beating that team," Casey
Fergus '12 said.

Both teams had a loss and then a win against the Blackcats,
and when the win came, a certain amount of respect came with it.

“Usually they’re not the most spirited team which is frus—
trating sometimes, but they were a lot nicer and cooler so we,
kind of, made friends with them,"Grummon said,

The team attributed their success in the final games ofthe
tournament to their legs.

“What separates this team from the team of two years ago
that got third at High Tide is that in that semifinal game, and
then again in the final, we had legs and the other team didn’t
so we just ran through them," Elliott said.

“One of our goals this year has been we want to put our
selves in a position to win the tournament on the last day,"Fer»

gus said. "But the team is strong enough and deep enough this
year that we were able to put ourselves in that position and then
we really clicked on that last day—some of the best ultimate
we’ve ever played as a team ever, probably."

Both teams said that in years past, they were beat by teams
that were able tojust outlast them but this year, the team made
a conscious effort to improve their fitness level, even though it
wasn’t pleasant,

“We had a lot ofpcoplc come out for indoor which is sur-
prising because indoor frisbee is terrible,"Grummon sald,“Not
to turn anyone off the sport but playing frisbee indoor is not
as much fun as playing Frisbee outdoor, When we're indoor its
harder because frisbee gets last pick for gym space so our prac-
tice schedules are pretty crazy and we don't ever really practice
at the same time or in the same place"

This years training was initiated by the captains and seniors,
but the process started earlier than that.

“It's a great team and this is a high point because all these
seniors are really good leaders and they’re teaching our first
years at a remarkable pace," Elliott said. “The first years are as
good as l was second semester sophomore year.”

Both of the finishes over Spring Break energized the team
heading into the postseason, Last year neither team made it
out of the Sectional tournament, although the year before both
teams made it out sectionals to make Regionals.

“We’re expecting to qualify out of sectionals,” Liebl said.
“There are some really strong teams in our sectional, Iowa State
and [University of] Iowa are both very good teams but we have
a shot at beating Luther and a shot at beating Drake so we’re
hoping to come out strong at sectionals.”

The sectional tournament will be held Saturday, April 24.
Bur both teams have already been successful in establishing the
foundations that will allow them to successful for years to come.

“The sky’s the limit as to where we can go next year,” Elliott
said. “We’ll maybe have 14 guys but they're all going to bc guys
that you can put in on game point. It speaks a lot to the seniors
right now and the seniors of the past two years. They have re-
ally molded this team inro something better than it was when
they got it"
