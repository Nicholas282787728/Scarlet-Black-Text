Pope has ius ted strongly
that a religious body has tran-
scendent standards of “good"
and “land.n By no means
should the church ever rubber
stamp the moral judgments of

poet is that religious leaders
don't know how, naively they
take ovcr whatever is an-
proved or accepted by public
opinion.

As a sociologist. Pope is best
known for ”Millhands and
Preachers." This is a detailed

Where is the group going?
Why? No one is concerned with

Diversified Career

Of Clergyman Pike

By W'inston L. King
Dean of the Chapel

1 have never met.nor heard
Dean James A. Pike. l have
only read some of his writings
what others say abullt him and
seen his picture. But 1 would
venture that all of the Iolloxw
mg ndiecnves can be appropri-
ately applied to‘him: vigorous,
manysrded, controversial, col-
orlul, active, -

Born, reared curl educated
as a Roman Catholic, he turn—
cd nwny tumpornx‘ilv trom all
active religious faith.

By the early 40‘s he was
known as a “'1' ing young law-
yer" with the Securities and
Exchange commission and‘ a law
tactllty member at George
Washington; univers y. But these
years also marked a returning
religious interest. He became a
member of the Episcopal church
in Washington, D. c, and began
to study for the priesthood.

Dean Pike has never been
line to be arraid or taking
sides in issues. He‘has otteu
spoken and written on corn
troversinl matters, On one oc- »
casion he nttirmed it to be
the “positive duty" or parents
to practice birth control when
health demanded it, as in
other cases it was a Christian
duty to have children.

Ont: or his most notable ac<
tions, or current interest, was
his refusal to preach the Bac-
calaureatc sermon at the 1953
Commencement of the Univer-
sity of the South and receive
an honorary degree, because the
trustees had just refused ndmit- ,
tance to Negro theological stu-
dents. His rejection in part read
thus: "I could not i conscience
rcceive a doctorate i'n.the white
divinity which Sewanee is ap-
parently prepared to offer the
church hereattcr."

Such is the man who will
preach at the 9 o’clock Convo<
cation Sunday Service
