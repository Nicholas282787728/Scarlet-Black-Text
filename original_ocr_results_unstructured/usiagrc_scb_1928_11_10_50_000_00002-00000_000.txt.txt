' 'l'Dl-IN’I' RESPONSIBILITY.

Says Earnest Martin Hopkins. president of Darts
mouth college. “The ultimate purpose of the sorcalled
cultural college is aroused thoughtfulness , . . Premising
its nork by the cultivation of some sense of cultural
values. and bulwarking it by an elementary stare of in-
dispensable knowledge. the primary interest of the col-
lege is in the possible capacity of its men to deal with
abstacticns' and to apply these to solving problems of

our social adjustments in our common life." Two pos-
sibilities are involved in this declaration, one that ch~
lege should provide the culture and the abstuctions.
leaving it [or the World to supply the laboratory. the
other that college should supply all of the elements, in-
cluding the cxpcrinlental test shop. Grinncll supports
the latter theory, and adds the students much of the re-
sponsibility of college life.

If. is argued in opposition to this that students are
immature. inexpert. and unlearned, It is utter stupidity,
say the opponents. to give to you and inexperienced peo-
pl; tlle illlportnrtt task of solving each others‘ problems,
the solution of which, in many instances, affects the ill-
dividual's life. These duties should be remanded to
experts. to men and women who have had long expur
iencc ill observing and dcftling with the human factor.
nlid are competent to work out the individuals problems
of malrildjllstmeut to his advantage.

Tile arguments favoring student responsibility val .
It is said that there is no more important type of know »
edge than knowledge of human nature There is no
more valuable lesson to learn than the lesson of civic
obligation. There is no more useful advice to he learn-
ed than the ability to live harmoniously with one‘s fel-
lows, to think with them. All of these things, it is argu—
ed constitute real knowledge, and contribute toward uli
appreciation of the vaster human problems studied in the
class room, Since the purpose of the college is to teach
tlle obligations of life, ours being a society in which the
individual must necessarily he a social being. it follows
that any college system which imparts fundamental
knowledge and capacities to its students is justified.

So we thoroughly believe in the Grinnell system of
student responsibility. It perhaps is not perfected. We
need a point system to diffuse the work; we need higher-
standards of student loyalty; we need experience. But
the system is not in the last analysis designed to work
perfectly at all times. In its imperfections lie its values.
for they necessitate again student thought and action
at all times.

After all. we believe that the plan is directed toward
a different aud more fundamental gonl than the perfect
functioning of all departments of student life. and it is
expressed in the single sentence by President Hopkins,
“The great obligation of the college is to inspire men
to think rather than to tell them what to think. The

worthwhile studcnt's mind is .i work shop. not a store- A

house." Cali you get students To think on anything
more acutely than on their personal problems? 15 there
anything that Will temper and improve this thinking
moré than the forge of thoughts of his fellows?
