Moving along on conservation ‘

by Ellen Heath

During recent years oi drastically in-
creasing luel costs, many institutions
havecutback on their energy consump~
tion. Last year, Grinnell College also
began instituting a number oi its own
conservation measures.

The programs introduced then and
still in effect this year Include
temperature controls for heating and
cooling oi buildings, reduction of the hot
water temperature by live degrees and
reduced use oi incandescent lighting
More flourescent lighting has been in-
stalled throughout the campus and the
lighting in the pool area has been reduc~
ed. Full lighting in the pool is used only
during swim meets,

Although under temperature control,
places like ARH are difficult to control
because of the zoning. Thermostats
placed in warm rooms also control the
temperature in rooms on another face
of the building that may be cooler. The
openness oi the building causes pro.
blems, too.

Suggestions made by last year's
Energy Policy Advisory Committee
(EPAC) included putting doors on the
vestibule outside of Cowles dining hall
so not as much cold air would come into
the hall during heavy trafﬁc times. The
EPAC also suggested the doors on
Steiner be replaced, the Physical
Education Complex doors be weather
stripped, and that small air condir
tioners take the place of the central air
conditioning in the science building.

Executive vice President Wally
Walker says these suggestions have not
yet been acted upon and replacement oi
the air conditioning may not be done
because it still needs a cost analysis.
The doors on Steiner were only painted
but the windows were replaced two
years ago. However, this past summer.
ARH received a new roof and insulation
and all oi the Campus structures were
tuck-pointed.

Walker, in the course of taking over
the job at former VlCe Provost Ken
Browning, will head up the EPAC this
year. As of yet there is no committee,
but Walker plans to put it together soon.
He will choose faculty members on the
basis of expertise and interest and will
ask the SGA for advice on student
members.

As part of the long range conserva»
tion plan, the library is being studied by
Ben Weese St Associates [or a possible
renol‘lation. The final decision belongs
to the college trustees, hut Walker said.
“from my perspective, it needs to be
done,” and he also thinks more room is
needed for books. The renovation might
include expansion and alteration of the
heating and cooling system. Burling
Library is energy-inciticient because oi
its single-pane glass window‘s and large
southern exposure.

The new exterior on Norris has
decreased the hall’s energy loss by 45 to

6

on percent. Renovations on other lialls
save 35 to 40 percent more heat. Walker
could not estimate what the savings is
in dollars because Ol the year to year
variation In fuel needs. The cost of
heating fuel for the 197778 year was
$186,000 and the cost for the 197875) year
was $229,000. Last winter was mild so
Walker does not expect the bill to be
much more, even ivith inllation,

The changes on renovated halls lll'
clude installation or styroioam insular
tion and new windows When asked If
decreased window area was even
seriously considered for the older halls,
Walker said no. He ieels most people
are concerned with the aesthetics of the
campus and want to preserve the
Gothic exteriors of the dorms

In a May 1979 issue oi the 5&3, Dale
Hawn, Director of the PhySlcal Plant.
expressed his concern al the po ‘Ibility
oi the college's iuel supply being cut oil
during a shortage, Hawn is now more
concerned with the cost 01 luel than
with the lack of it. Both he and Walker
are optimistic that the school‘s supply
will last through the winter and all of
the oil tanks are full now. Hawn said
