EASTERN AND W STERN FOO r»
BALL CHAMPLONSHIPS.

Some vvonticrinl Teams Have Been Dc-
vclopcd and the West is not liar
Behind rho East.

The Thanksgiving games are
lost and won and the football sea
son is over for this year. A review
of the football situation will not
be out oi place now. especially
since the championships were so
decisively won. Thecomparative
strength of Yale and Harvard was
reversed this year. Last year
Harvard won the undisputed
championship oi the east by a
score 2270 over Yale; this year
Yale did Harvard one,better, the
score being 234), Harvard owes
her defeat largely to Coach Farley
who persisted in choosing men oi
“beet" instead of those who un»
derstood the game. Harvard’s
line could not hold Yale's line and
her back ﬁeld were simply cut
played everywhere by the swittcr
and stronger Yale backs. Glass
of Yale was a loner of strength in
pulling men through the lllle and
opening big holes for the rushes
of the backs; he has been com
pared to the phenomenal guard oi
a dozen years ago, Heffelﬁnger,
whose position he plays.

Harvard ranks second but she
could not hold Yale as Brown sucr
ceeded in doing two weeks earlier
when Yale had a hard time in de-
icating the school irom Provi»
dence, io—or Brown has a won-
derfully strong team considering
the materialbutlosttoDartmouth.

West Point has the enviable
record oi being oneoftwo teams
that succeeded in scoring on
Yale. when a tiegarnewas played.
The military school has the usual
strong team.

For second honors Princeton
could easily dispute with Harvard
as she has defeated some of the
strongest teams in the east, such
as Lehigh, Cornell, Washington
and Jefferson, Navy, and held Yale
clown to 12, succeeding in a drop
kick which netted her 5 points,

Pennsylvania, Cornell, Columr
bia, Syracuse and the Carlisle
Indian team are on about an
equality it comparative scores are

a criterion in football.

THE THANKSGIVING GAME.

Gtinncll De .ll by Dinkc in the Annual
Thanksgiving Gallic, 47rd.

In the seventh :lnntlrtl Thanks-
giving game \\llll Drake Univelv
sity. Grinncll met (lelcrtt on at
ﬁeld and hciore tr large crowd in
which both sides had many loyal
rootct's.

The game was a iast one in
which tlle weight and splendid
interference of the Blue and
White, together with the number
oi take plays won the game.
Drake scored early in the ﬁrst
half and although Grinnell rztl—
lied at times and carried the ball
for good gains she could nothold
the Christians down to a low
score, the halt ending 29 o. Dral e
making ﬁve touch downs and Ba
con kicking tour oi the goals.

In the second half Grillnell
took a brace after the ﬁrst touch
down and played better ball, but
in spite of a ﬁerce resistance on
the part oi Grinnell, Drake was
able to score three touchdowns in
this half, Bacon kicking all the
goals.

For Drake, Kinney and Main
were the star players ofthc day
both an offence and defence, the
longest runs oi the game being
credited to them. For Grinnell
the whole team played stubbornr
1y against overwhelming odds
and were in the plays irom start
to ﬁnish.

Drake won the game with her
superior weight and speed and
it was evident to all who saw the
game that she played better ball
than ever before this season and
that there was no team in the
state not excepting the State
University which could have de-
feated her Thursday.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL. IOWA, WEDNF DAY, DECEMBER 3, |90

BASKET BAY. .

Tire Season Hos Berni! anti c.
Prospects arc Bright. F st
Game won.

its the football season draws to
a closc and cold weathcr sets in.
students and athletes begin to
look around fol‘sorne game into
which to put their extra time and
energies. During the lasttwo or
three years basket ball has
recommended itseli so highly as
an indoor game, that all schools
having suitable grounds have in-
troduced it and placed it on a
level with other branches of
athletics.

It is a game requiring some in-
dividual skill and endurance. but
it also combines with thisachance
tor team work, which is necessary
tor any game to be popular
and permanent with students and
players. The game was introduced
to Grinnell on the completion ol
the new gymnasium and irom its
past record promises to become
a ﬁxture here.

The teams representing Iowa
College in the past have made a
tail' shoning in the state, but they
have not been as good as they
should have been with tho advan-
tages they have had.

lnthe gymnasium is laid out
one of the ﬁnest courts in the
west, and if the students will turn
out and take hold of the game
there is no reason why Grinnell
should not turn out a winning
team.

During the time between
Thanksgiving and Christmas,class
teamswill be organized and just
before the holidays the class
games will be played to decide
the championship oi the college.
It is positively necessary that the
men should turn out for these
class teams. From them the
‘Varsity men will be picked who
will represent the college in the
games now being planned.

The interest in basket ball
throughout the west has increas-
ed immensely in the last two
years and an extensive schedule
is being made out in the state
and with teams from other states.
If Grinnell is to have a team who
shall be a credit to her, there must

be competition for the different
positions. ii everyone takes hold
