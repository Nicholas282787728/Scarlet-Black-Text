0 Exit Chapel.

Obituary Noice: Grinnell Chapel, age 78,
passed away quietly last Saturday morning,
April 19, after a protracted, lingering ill-
ness. Grinnell alumni, faculty, and students
will hear of her death with deep regret, l'e-
calling her inspiring personality and beauv
tiful spirit previous to her decline. Truly,
a great benefactor of Grinnell College has
gone the way of all flesh.

It it not with any feeling of flippancy
that we write the above. To the contrary,
we merely wish to impress upon our fellow-
students the signi 'cance of the action re—
cently taken by the administration and stu»
dent government. We were at first dismay-
ed that an institution so rich in tradition
and so instrumental in the growth of Grin—
nell should be abolished by a sudden decree.
A post-mol‘tem has brought to light the fols
lowing facts which go far to explain the
recent step.

Though death came suddenly, examination
of the institution’s organs showed that a

, process 01' decay had set in at least five
‘ ears ago. Some had given up all pretense
,of contl‘buting to the organism’s life——
these‘uere the students who preferred to
sleep, smoke, or eat breakfast more than
attend chapel. Some had continued to corn
tribute in a listless, lackadaisical manneri
these were the students who found chapel
a convenient place to whisper to their
friends or cram for the next class»period.
Some continued to contribute whole-hearted
1y only to receive little compensation for
their efforts~these were the students who

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

attended for spiritual and mental refresh-
ment, only to hear learned rhetoric almost
beyond comprehension.

Chapel died, as every institution must,
when the original purpose for which it was
created disappeared. What was this pur-
pose ‘2 It was to establish a daily devotional
period wherein the student body mlgllt be
aroused to a realization of the finer things
ill life. Only a shell of its once sturdy, cl'er
ative being, it must be admitted that chapel
did not the an untimely death.

0 An Example of Foresight

The much publicized youth who misplaced
his notebook and then lamented that he had
lost his college education is more or less
symbolic of the recent trends in educational
development. Even at its best, mall‘s mem—
ory is apt to be faulty and incomplete, so
rather than rely upon the necessarily lime
ited supply of knowledge which he may
have stored in his own erratic brain, he has
come to rely more and more upoll reference
and research in such institutions as librarr
ies, museums and laboratories where the
whole accumulated resources of the past are
at his disposal.

That is why recent wholesale and indis-
criminate bombings of libraries, art galler~
ice, and museums are of grave concern to
all thoughtful world scholar With the loss
of all records, present day civil .ation would
be in much the same plight as the college
student who lost his notebook.

The Library of Congress and other librarr
ies throughout the United States are show-
ing clear sighted ,visiou ill preparing now to
transfer valuable records to specially con»
structed bomb proof vaults outside the city.
Such action is not to be interpreted as an
indication that Washington, convinced of
the inevitability of American involvement
in the war, is rushing defenses for the ap-
proaching air raids. The construction of 1 ~
inforced concrete Vaults, in trenches several
feet belolv the surface of the earth, is las
borious and takes time, as does the trans-
portation of records, all of which must first
be photo-duplicated so that present research
may not be interrupted. Many of the (loci?
ments which are being transferred were sent
to this country from European libraries at
the outbreak of the war, and it would indeed
be most short-sighted negligence if provis-
ion were not made for their safekeeping and
preselvation for future generations while it
is still possible to do so. When bombs fall,
things happen very fast, and there is little
time for cool, deliberative action.

The libraries of this country are (lisplztv-
ing rational, (lispassiohate foresight in attr
ing now to preserve the reservoir of a whole
world civilization.

To the Editor:

We of Pine Tree disapprove of
the manner in which the mar—
riage of one of the girls or our
cottage, namely Barbers. Stewart,
was announced in the April 16
issue of the Scarlet and Black.

We feel that the matter was
not one to be treated in such a
light tone and should have been.
written as 2|. news story.

We do not wish to be over-
critical of the treatment of this
occasion, but feel that the write
up was hardly complimentary.
