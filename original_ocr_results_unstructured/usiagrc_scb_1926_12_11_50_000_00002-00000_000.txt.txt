ON “'l’l'l! TII DANCE! I

Somcthncs we wish we could take over the manage]
ment or an orchestra for one evening and try lull experi-I
liient. instead of ten or twelve long drawn out dances
nith three or [our encores. we would play twenty short'
snappy dances. l

t is not pleasant to dance a straight program but
on thc other hand, nobody lilies to trade many dances
wlieu cach dance lasts from twenty minutes to half an
hour We're for more short dances and less of the pro-
longed var , Two encores should suffice for the most
popular numbers.

On with the dance!

There should not be a single vucant chair at the
Varsity football dinner next Wednesday evening at the
men's dining hall. From present appearances, the ques
tion seems to be more that of accommodating the num-
ber of men who wish to show their appreciation to the
1926 Pioneer elecen. If every plate is not. when, the
Scarlet and Black will be sadly disappointed. ,

The business men of the town arc to be congratu»
lated for the spirit and interest which they have shown
in sponsoring the affair. The bouquet is‘ a real tcsti-
monial of the support which the town of Grinnell gives
to the college and its activities. 1

And“ method oi [renting students who persist in
removing- library boolis without signing for them has been
devised at the University of Washington, at Seattle. Ten
hours were recently added to the graduation requirement
of a student at the western institution for that mis-l
demeanor.

Such punishment appears ilntliei' severe but the atti—
tude of the authorities on the seriousness of the offense,
is deﬁnitely established.

vesper programs in advance but the program committee .

Editor, Scarlet and Black.
Dear Sir:

In the history of intei'collegiii.e
athletics it has been customary lot
the school to award letters to those
who hare met certain requirements iii
athletic events. It is given as .n
honor and to show the school's apr
prcciatioii of effort.

It has recently been learned that
out athletic department—our school~
is not giving sweaters to some dc;

‘ serving players on this year’s team.

They will not get the football Honor
G sweater. Why? Because "the sen—
iors are giving white sweaters and
that's enough." It is true that the
seniors are giving the custom -
white sweater, but that does not e.
cuse the athletic department. The
senior white sweater cannot be subs
stituleu for the honor G sweater. It
is not an award but rather a symbol
of distinction. Th sen or sweater
lS given its a class g 't to its [ootlirtll
men and the athletic department has
never had it thing to do about it —,
now they are leaving their duty up to
the senio s. Does it not look as
lllollgll the senior class is financing
the itthletic department?

in past seasons when Grinnell has
not been so successful, these sweat-
crs lime been awarded without hesita»
tiou. Now that Grinnell has won
distinction with a successful team. it
is all the more reason that these
sweaters be awarded, These men who
devote time, energy and thought to
the game; these who sacrifice them-
selves and give everything for the
success of‘the team—are they not
worthy of recognition?

The men do not look upon the value

Hebrews can do anything he wants to‘ practical because we demand causes of the sweater in terms of dollars but

er said that it was not an ancient
‘idea but a very sophisticated thing
winch had developed from the metal
physical. "The virgin birth has no
significance to the mun who thinks in
the modern way."

Mr. Nollcn cautioned the young
man who is attempting to solve these
problems to consult an authority on
the subject and then to be sure of the
facts and -{echnique before an indivi—
dual decision is drawn.

In conclusion the speaker said,
"Christianity has found a refuge in

impossible to bar

rather upon the honor of wearing an
Honor G sweater, not only on the
campus but elsewhere,
means a great deal to a man and is
honored by mi -west colleges and uni-
versities.

The least the college can do is to
give sweaters but they are not even
doing that. it has been left to the
seniors who desire to show, in some
w: ,\their appreciation. Never has
fore in Grinnell's history have sweatv
ers been refused to those deserving
and there is no reason for doing so
this year. Surely a matter of a few
dollars is no excuse nor the fact that
the seniors are centering an honor on
their football men.

We want athletics in Grinnell to
grow and be a part of the school but
the vital thing in athletics is the
”square deal" with all concerned. The
