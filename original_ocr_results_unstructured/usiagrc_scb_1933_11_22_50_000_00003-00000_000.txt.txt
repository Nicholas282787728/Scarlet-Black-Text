Drake Wins Last Football
Game of Season 13 to 0

Drake university upset the Pie-
.neers for the second time this sea-
son, 13 to o, to spoil the homecoming
game last Saturday ofteinoon. and
to end the football season for Grin-
nell college without victory.

Al wieland, leading Missouri Vhlr
ley scorer, was outstanding for the
opponents on offense, doing- most of
the passing, and scoring one touch-
down, The Bulldogs made their first
points late in the first quarter oii a
long pass from Wieland to Deskin.
The latter received the ball on the
15-yard line and raced the remaining
distance to score.

The second touchdown for the
Drake aggregation was accounted
for in the third quarter. and was his
so a direct result of a long pass from
Wieland to Deskin. The ball was put
on the Grinnell five-yard line and af-
ter two plays Wieland carried the
ball over. The Bulldogs threatened
the Grinnell goal twice in the fourth
’qnarter. but each time the line braced
and the opponents lost the ball.

Don Kingery, midget quarterback
for the Pioneers, played a good
game for the losers, figuring in the
offensive attack and twice stopping
a Drake man when he was the last
defender between him and the goal-
line. Bradley's punting kept the Pie-
neers out of danger on many occa-
sions, but coach v. Green’s team
proved too powerful, and Coach
Watt's men spent the majority of the
game on defensive.

May Shift Positions
It is probable that Coach Ti-ues-
dale will shift positions of the cag-
ers in order to find his best combina-
tion. Dick Mason and Mickey Frye
are the veteran forwards. Mason
>showed flashes last year of develop-
ing into a fast, accurate player, with
a righbhand hook shot which rivaled
_ the southpaw shots of Hank Duncan.
his running mate. Frye. who was
not in school last year, played regu-
larly as a sophomore, and was also
a crack shot. ‘
Harve oliphant, Julius Bauer, Eu~
gene Klepfer, and Guilford Collison
are men who will have a good chance
at forward positions or the center
post. In measuring the jumping abil-
ity of the men Monday, it was dis—
covered that Collison had the highest
jumping reach, leaping up so that-
his finger tips touched 122 inches
above the floor, while Dick Phelps,
veteran center, was second. reaching
120% inches.

Morgan Improves

Phelps showed up last year as one
of the most aggressive men on the
team. Bob Morgan, standing 6 feet
4% inches tall, although suffering at
.present from a charlie horse ac-
quired in the Drake football game
Saturday, showed great development
at the center position last season,
and has a good chance to show his
wares this year.

other forward candidates are Ed
Henningscn, Bill McFai-lin and Bob
MCAliSLer, all of whom are good ball
handlers and accurate shots,

Santi Holds Collin

Capt. Gaston Santi, short and
wiry, hut rated as one of the most
consistent guards in the Missouri
valley conference last season, is
number one man among goal defend-
ers, He held cornic Collin of Creigh-
ton to thc center ,of the floor in the
first PioneerrBluejay contest last
winter, a feat not duplicated by any
other guard in the conforcnce.

Les Manns is the other dependable
letterman landing don-ii n guard
post, while Harry DuMont, trick pass
artist; Jim Bradley, strong, egg/rear
sive player. and Paul McCully, c}:-
pci-t on long shots, constitute Truess
daie's aboveﬂverage guard material.

Robert Y. Kerr, alumnus and truss
tee of Grinnell college, said in his
chapel address that of all the men
selected for distinction in scholarship
and leadership for Rhodes scholar-
ships. none had choscn politics for a
vocation. Mr. Kerr went on to ex-
plain why most people thought poli-
tics an irrational career, basing his
explzmatiuu upon these two points:
First. the constant change in the
character of political duties; second.
the changes of political habits of an
earlier day.

“The government is the only insti-
tution drawing authority from all
people,” said Mr. Kerr. Therefore, he

maintained that more interest
should be displayed in politics, along
two lines of action; adoption of Rus—
sian types of politics embodying can»
tralized control and unlimited lihcr-
ty, or economic cooperation and ins

0f the general field of politics Mr.
Kerr said. in conclusion. "I know of
no more important service in which
a private citizen may be of use."

”It seems to me that there is
something closer to each one of this
particular audience than social or-
der or international relations," said
Prof. Frederick L. Baumann. asso—i
ciate professor of history, in his
chapel talk Tuesday. “That some'
thing is the pertinent question,
‘Whht are we here for 7’ and further,
‘What are modern college students
supposed to receive; what are the
professors supposed to give 7'"
Baumann declared his belief in
the fact that the early aims of col»
lege were to impart culture, but thatl
culture was being replaced by what
he believes is conveniently tcrinco
“social adjustment." Social adjust—
ment, continued Professor Baumann,
seems to mean dances and moonlight
nights to the students, while to the
instructors "it seems to be the ideal-

istic«hope of a trained citizenry to l

march forth from the portftls of
learning, to take their place in the
social order and international relae
lionship movements."

As a parting thought. Mr.

dents in his audience were obtaining,
instead of ”social adjustment" a cor»

cossed at a meeting of the freshman
class sometime in the near future,
Truesdalc announced.
