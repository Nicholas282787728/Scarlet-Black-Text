of the sight. The moonlight skipped
iroui one wave to another and finally
kissed the side or the gondola. A
bend in the canal revealed it new
vista oi overhanging, mysterious
buildings that rose sheer from the
water’s edge. They iasciunted her.
They hiui small barred Windows that
shed a soft glow on the glassy sur-
face. What was behind those dim
squares or light, what strange dramns
were being enacted on the other side
of Lhose dull walls?

A shit crooning melody was in the
air. A violin snatched Lhe thread or
song and tossed it aloft. The melody
soared to dangerous heights, trembled,
fell and climbed again. It cold of a.
Venetian lovers' meeting. ,

Another curve in the canal. More
moonlight and more hall shadows.

the lights flashed on and the movie
was over.

poor;

But nowadays We rise to roar.
