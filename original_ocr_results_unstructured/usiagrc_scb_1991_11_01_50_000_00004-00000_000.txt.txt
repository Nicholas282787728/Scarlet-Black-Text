No one is free while
newspapers are suppressed

Jordan Magill's column raises an issue that the Scarlet arid Black
believes should be addressed: the right of a publication to print opinions of
individuals and groups, and the purposes behind such opinions. In the
September 20 issue of The Grinriell Spectator, the editor in chief allowed a
now»notorious "observation" of Professor Maria Mootry's "unprofessoriai"
classroom behavior. Since that item was printed, various reactions have
been heard aroundcarnpus, from the Multi-ELhnicCoaliLion‘slcttcrclaiming
that the "observation" was racist, to other off-hand suggestions that The
Spectator should be banned The Scarlet and Black wishes to address these
allegations andto defend therighm ofanewspaper thatmostwould consider
our competition.

First, as Jordan Magill
pointed out, The Spectator is funda-
mentally protected by the First

5 TAP F
Amendment. More importantly, li. E D ITO RIAL
belis defined as a printed defamatory

statement that is intended to expose an individual to public hatred or ridicule,
therefore, The Spectatar's legal rights on the Constitutional level remain
unquestionable. To attempt to limit the freedom to print is to limit the free
exchange of ideas and to try to shape speech and thought to fit the majority
opinion. Those who attempt to ban a publication imply their unwillingness
to accept the presence of beliefs which contradict their own.

Second, the complex issue of whether The Spectator's observation was
racially motivated is understandably harder to defend, for no one knows the
editors' inner thoughts and/or prejudices. Rather, analyzing The Spectator's
"observation"must be done grammatically, for such an evaluation is essenr
tial to a case of harassment or libel. In the "observation," Maria Mootry was
not directly labeled nprofessorial, and the ﬁnal phrase concerning
Eurocentrism was placed as sentence independent of the description of
Mootry's alleged behavior. Mostprecisely, the term Euroccntrrsm is a word
applied to away of thought, oratype of education. Therefore, Eurocentrism
doesnotmodify Mootry. However, if the phrase applied had been "Eurocentric
peoples" or even "Europeans and Enro»Americans," then the "observation"
would have been obviously derogatory toward African Americans and
Mootry herself

The ScarletandBIack does not. claim to agree with the "observation." Yet
we do believe that the accusations against The Spectator disregard the legal
issues in an effort to denounce a publication which does not conform to
majority opinion at Grinnell College.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Student attacks Spectator controversy

To the editor.

Well, the Crt'rtriell Spectator has
opened its big mouth againandblastcd
Maria Mootry. As quickly as their
mouths opened, the Mulii-Ethnic
Coalition has opened its mouth and
charged“foul."Ms, Mootry feelsthat
the story printed about her will dam-
age her career and is iacially moti—
voted.

Both sides DO have a point, and it
goes something like this:

I would grant Mike Kent and his
loathsome little group of, excuse the
term, reporters, have the right to re-
port“ncws” concerning questionable
behavior on ihcpariofa professomo
matter how poorly they say it. lfihese
allegations are true, this is a matter
thatshouldbe more fully examined. I
have never experienced this from any
of my teachers at this school, and the
writer/s of this article have presume
ably not, which this why this story is
of interest here, a school of high aca-
demic repute.

FortunatelyforTheSpcclator,Lhcy
didNOTprintwhatiheyreallywantcd
to say, which would be—"We dislike
Maria Mootryasaprofessorand think
her methods are bad, and we have
therefore some up with some good
dirt to smear on her name.”

Maria MDOLry, on the other hand,
also has ti valid point, but The Specr
tutor had no right to go after her with

vtndictivcness that was unseemly
even for them. This is not a ractal
issue, but it IS an issue of a teacher
being wrongfully harmed by an
overzealous also-ran newspaper.

I do not know which is worse.
because I have never taken a class
from Ms.Mootry,andlusually laugh

at The Crime]! Spectator as a piece
ofcrass,kncc-Jerk archconservatism,
butto Ms. Mootry Isay: Ifthis is true,
you need some tact in the classroom.
And to the Grinnell Spectator, I say,
you definitely need some tact on the
printed page.

Name Withheld

Hill issue carries implications

To the editor,

For those who have not heard the
news from Oklahoma, I wanted to
mention that state Represenmtive
LeonardSullivan (R-OK) haswnltcn
a letter to the president of the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma asking that Anita
Hill be dismissed immediately, He
writes, “We must get this ‘left wing
exiremist' inﬂuence off the campus
before it spreads further. We can‘t
affordtohaveahighprofileprofessor
on campus that millions of Ameri-
cans, according to polls and national
talk shows, believe is a fantasizing
liar."

RepresentativeSullivan’sposition
generates many questions, Whatdoes
the treatment of Anita Hill in the
hearings say about the stereotypes
and attitudes about African Ameri-
can women? Is this sending a mes-
sage to the country and women in
general that making charges ofsexual

harassment is “political and/or pro-
fessional suicide?" When did polls
and talk shows replace our judicial
system? What happened to innocent
until proven guilty?

The issue boils down to this: We
don'tknow ifProl'essor Hill was tellr
ing the uuth. We cannotassume that
because Hill is a fanlisizing liar,just
because"millions of Americans, ac-
cording to polls and national talk
shows, believe [she] is a fantasizing
liar." Sullivan’s request to have Hill
removed from her post is obvrously
an attempt to limit, without conclu-
sivcevidence.herfreedom ofspeech.
(“We must getthis ‘leftwirig extreme
ist’ inﬂuence off campus before it
spreads further.”) If you support the
basrc rights of being assumed inno-
cent untilproven guilty, and freedom
of speech. there is a national Iellerr
writing campaign in support of Hill,
and your voice needs to be heard.

CURIOUSERAND CURIOUSER
When is a label not a label?

The Grirtriell Spectator‘s com-
ments several weeks ago about Maria
Mootry'suseofoffvcolorlanguagein
class is one such horse. Ifthc animal
is alive or dead, it seems to me, is
irrelevant. Perhaps The Speciator's
comments have met their much-de-
served fate and been used as kindling.
That does not change the fact that
both the comments, and the way that
The Spectator defended them, repre—
sentsomcthingalitilehard to ignore.

These are The Spectator‘: exact
comments: ”Does Professor Maria
Mootry know the meaning of
unprofessorial behavior? Students to
port that during her classes she regu-
larly uses expressions like F*ck and
‘Jesus P‘cking Christ.’ Oh. we're
sorry.Weforgotihatarticulaiespcech
is a vestige of Eurocentrism.” Now
when The Spectator was criticized
fortheirsiatementsbystudenisclaim-
ing it was racist, its editor attempted
to take the moral high ground by
claiming that they were merely criti-
cizing a professor, something which
is well within their rights. They
claimed that the accusation of racism
was groundlessand simplybeing used
as a label by those who disagreed.

Now the fact that they have the
right to say what they like is not
something I would question; I have
alwaysbelicvedpcoplehavctheright
to measure outjust enough rope with

Jordan
Magill

which to hang themselves. Whether
the comment is racist, however, is
another matter about which YOU
mustdecide. The Spectatoris correct
that the word racist has been ever
used recently as a catch all label to
throw at anyone who disagrees with
the opinions of the liberal majority.
Hell, that label has been thrown at me
a few times. But the fact that a word
issooiten misused deuacis only from
the clarity of its meaning, not from
the reality of its existence.

Was this statemenian example of
racism or simply a complaint about
the conduct of a professor? it strikes
me as odd that they would single out
the language of this professor and
ignore all others. Is Maria Mootry the
only professor who curses in class? It
seems to me thatl have heard more
thana few faculty members say things
mat would make Andrew Dice Clay
blush. Was this an example of
“unprofessorial behavior?” It seems
to me that if the goal of the professor
should be to educate, and if the use of
foul, or as The Spectator might call it.
“inarticulate” language is a vehicle
by which this can be done, then so be
it. Why is this language intirticulaie?

Many of these words can be found in
the works of great American authors,
or are we going to stop reading
Hemingway and Salinger because
they no longer ﬁt our definition of
“articulate?" It seems to me that the
worst that they can be accused of is
poor manners, and since when is that
a punishable offense in our educa-
tron?

It seems to me that one cannot
necessarily use this as a basis to cic-
cuse The Spectator of being racist.
Theydosingleoutoneprofessor, and
that professor happens to be black.
Racist? Miiny professors engage in
similar behavior, but they are
ignored by The Spectator in favor of
this one Racist? They make a clear
association between being articulate
andEurocentricor,inotherwords,so
Called “inarticulate” behavior be-
comes by definition mulliculturaliSL
I am not sure why speciﬁcally this
distinction ismade.lmustbemissing
Lliecleardifference.Racist?Youmust
make that decision. Each of us must
decide the meaning of that particu-
larly heinous word and use it where '
we see fit. The word may be thrown
around a bit too much these days, but
itstill clearlymeans something. Rac—
ist'.7 That is up to you; I, for one, am
not one to throw labels around.
