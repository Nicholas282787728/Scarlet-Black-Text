The current exhibit at Grinnell’s
Forum Terrace Gallery. Matt Saiia's
Secrets, does not conform to the tra
ditional image of paint on canvas,
brought to mind by the word “art."

According to the artist, the dis-
play, which is an anonymous collec»
tion of secrets from members ofthe
Grinnell community, was not in
tended simply to question the idea
of what is seen as art, but rather to
offer a forum for people to reveal
their deepest secrets, to explore the
relations between people as repre
sented by the secrets they revealed.
and to provide its
audience with my
sight into the
Grinnell commu—
nity.

Sa
work follows his
theme of journeys.
“This work is a
journey on many
different levels,"
Saiia said. “It is a
journey ofme as an
artist, going through the steps to cre-
ate it. along with thejoumcys people
took inside themselves to find their
secrets. This work started with the
idea, continued through the process,
and still continues with what people
take out oli -it does not begin or
end in the Show." This exhibit, as
does all ofSaiia's work, reﬂects his
“interest in relationships and the
connections between things-the
meaning between expressions."

Saiia collected over 200 secrets
to include in the show. He typed all
the handwritten entries in order to
“remove the hand from the word so
they arejust symbols of meanings."
He also used no capitalization so as
not “to hide behind grammatical
rules or make any letter more impor—
tant than another." He did not cen—
sor or edit, with the exception of
spelling errors, any of the submis»
sicns.

The secrets are not displayed in

“The secrets
speak of Grinnell,
who we are, and
they break that

--Matt Saiia ‘97

any particular order so that the au»
dtence may create its own connec»
[ions with all types of entries ranr
domly intermingled. “They speak
of Grinncll, who we are as a come
munity, and they break that down.
Grinnell IS a very open atmosphere
but it still holds on to some barri-
ers,” Saiia said.

However, Saiia did make many
conscious decisions about the dis
play ofhts work. Much thought was
put into font size, layout of the se-
crets and the tape holding theln to
the wall. According to Saiia, the tape
is designed as a “film" over secrets
which are otherwise completely
bated. This is be-
cause. “We can
never present
outside ourselves
what we are 100
percent on the in»
side.”

Saiiaconsiders
all of these secrets
[0 be “incredibly
precious although
the paper itself is
worthless. People
were giving that which they horde
the most. At least that was the re-
quest. and some people weren't able
to do that. People carry these around
with them and don‘t express them
to others because they cannot let
down their guard."

Saiia welcomes responses to his
work. as well as new secrets. Both
of these can be given at the exhibit,
which opens Wednesday, November
6 at 4:15. Refreshments will be
served.

A double feature of Augustine
and The Match Factory Girl plays
in the Forum tonight at 8:30 and in
Harris on Saturday night at 7:30.
Together, the two movies run a little
over two hours.

A Finnish production, The
Match Factory Girl tells the story
of Iris (Kati Outinen), a woman
ignored by everyone around her.
She goes to discos frequently but
is never asked to dance. But then
she buys a red dress and one
evening catches a man's eye. She

Ignored, clueless, and disliked

The characters in this weekend’s campus movies are a troubled bunch

has a one night stand with him and
becomes pregnant. The man will
have nothing to do with her and her
parents kick her out ofthe house be-
cause of her condition. Iris buys
some rat poison and . . . . 7

This is a very interesting movie.
I really did not anticipate how it
would end. it is a somber ﬁlm With
very little dialogue, but the scenes
speak nicely for themselves. It is
worth watching because ofthe direc-
tion, if nothing else. I enjoyed it.

The French ﬁlm Augustine is a
change of pace from The Match Fac-
tory Girl. It is about a man named
Augustine (Iean-Chretien Sibertine-

Blane), who aspires to be an action
ﬁlm star, In the meantime, he works
pan-time in the legal department of
an insurance company He has the
chance to audition for a bit part as a
hotel room service man and decides
to do research for the role by per
fonnlng the job for a day in an up:
scale hotel, ‘

The movie is very funny. Augus—
tine tries hard, but seems kind of
clueless at times. The acting is a lot
of fun and the script is inspired. I
would recommend this film. Argue
ir‘ne won the Grand Jury Prize at the
Cannes Film Festival.

Welcome in the Dollhouse is about

an awkward girl in junior high
school who is universally disliked
by her classmates and virtually ig-
nored by her parents. She struggles
with the everyday world without tee
ally understanding it.

Although I was troubled by the
absence of_a concrete conclusion,
the ﬁlm's premise is fantastic and
the filmmakers pull it off nicely.
The main character is portrayed by
Heather Matazzaro,-a talented
young actress. The ﬁlm took the
Audience Favorite Award at the
199SSundance Festival. It will be
shown at Harris tonight at 7:30 and
Saturday afternoon at 2:00.

di. The Minnesota Chinese Music
Ensemble has also collaborated
with Western music groups to pre-
miere and to perform compositions
specifically written for Chinese

musical instruments accompanied
by Western instruments.

While concerned mainly with
Chinese culture, the message of
unity is very important to the Enr

who is interested in playing Chir
nese music to join us. The Enr

sic is an international language and
there are no cultural boundaries
for any of the art forms. Through
mutual respect, understanding, and
acceptance we can all work to-
gether regardless of different cul-
tural backgrounds."

The concert is a Sesquicenten-
nial event.
