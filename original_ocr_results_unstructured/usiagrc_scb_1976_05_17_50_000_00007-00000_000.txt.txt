have been angered by protessors
who are willing to grant extensions
because we have other papers or
cxatns due. but do not show similar
understanding when we are in the
midst of the final stages oi a
produclion. We are also saddened
that so Iew [acuity and ad-
ministration members make a

While we are not saying that we
have been stiﬂed by the ad-
ministration. We see what is
becoming a problem [or the
student in pursuit ot a truly
comprehensive theatre education
within the scope OI a liberal arts
education. What we are asking for
is a general show oi support for a
program that has grown cons
tinuously in range and quality. it
does not seem unreasonable to us
to ask that the college support its
major departments.

Knapp:
Torment!

by Dick Knapp
When i think at what my tour years at Grinneli have been like, I’m
tormented by two conﬂicting conclusions.

0n the one hand:

It's as though the alfalfa burning
in the air when I arrived at
Grinnell on a hot August's day was
really marijuana and ever since
I've been riding the crest at a
terrific high. I |hink of the har-
monious balance I've struck
between work and play, enjoying
the first rate academics ot‘ Grins
nell, yet taking enough time pit to
get drunk in the cornfields and
enjoy the tranquility otrural Iowa.
I feel as though liberal arts have
touched oil in me the spark oi
intellectual curiosity, and that I'm
a living confirmation of the college
catalogue and the Grinnoll
Magazine in that i really do
possess a critical ability and 1 ask
a lot of questions. I feel gratified in
being educated, and confidence
that I can continue learning on my
own. In fact, the allalla went so to
my head that I think I've heard a
symphony the whole time at
Grinnell, and at times I believe I
was ready to bust out at my pants
with joy and fulfillment

0n the other hand:

It's as though the alfalfa Burning
in the air when I arrived at
(irinncll on a hot August's rlay was
a powerIul barbituate indigenous
to Iowa, and that for the last four
years I‘ve been struggling unr
successtully to stand up on my own
feet. I think oi only the disapr
pointments I’ve suirered at
Grinnell. all the course Work I’ve
slid by on, the parties I’ve missed,
people I‘ve never gotten to know,
the bad judgments I've made. I
think at what a battle it’s been to
concentrate and keep tip with work

Maybe my Grinnell career is best described by both these views, or
maybe by something in between, but probably nothing can describe my
tour years. i can’t put my ﬁnger on this Grinnell Experience. And even it
