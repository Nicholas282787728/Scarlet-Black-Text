the tuturc. "Dignity, that's what will
make Grinnell different in the future,"
he stated.

Numerous people commented and
voiced their opinions on this issue, but
lew oi tered positive solutions to the pro»
blem Three major points were made
by a mayority oi students. First:
Students should have been asked prior
to the change in the policy. Second:
Should Grinnell seek a diversity of
students based on athletic abilities?
Third: Is the school reaching out to the
students as an institution oi higher
education?

the question of who is benefitting in this
situation, the institution or the students,
Bowen pointed out that there should be
a union between all students. both
scholasttcally and athletically. The St|lr
dcnt body should not be competing as
athletes vs. the "freaks "

Another student commented on the

fact that Grinnell has always been
known as a liberal institution, but as he
sces it, Grinnell is actually quite cone
servative. This freshman student ex7
pressed the beliel that the challenge at
the '80 will be to create a balance be-
tween good students and good athletes.
Grinnell has a diversity of students,
commented another student, itussell
Pierce, who Viewed the issue as only a
peripheral problem. Pierce believes.
that this attitude of diversity should
result in excellence inside the
classroom as well as outside, He also
made the statement that individuals
should tolerate this diversity.

Overall, this discussion revealed the
current concerns of numerous Students

recruitment ol more athletes is chang-
