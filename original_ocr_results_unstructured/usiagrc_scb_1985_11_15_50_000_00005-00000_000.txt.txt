Then in the spring ot 1985 a group ot

imately eight-million dollais worth oi

that the dc sion to sell these stocks was
made hcc use at the increasing economic
instability ot the region. but it is a positive
step nonetheless On Thursday oi this

It is important to note that whereas the

initiated the rise of trade unions and a pro-

organization that commands large mass
support and that seems to survive attacks
irom the regime. Since the organization
does not rely solely on the leadership oi a
low prominent members. the government
cannot disorganivc the people simply by
the elimination of leadership The sustain-
