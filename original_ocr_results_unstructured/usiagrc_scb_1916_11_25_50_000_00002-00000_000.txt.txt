TH NH YOU, IIISINIZSS )II‘W.
We are glad now that the Grinnclh
Cornell game was played on Friday
instead ol Saturday. It has given
local business men a chance to wit
ness one or Grinnell's big tootball

games,
They have deserved such consider»

ation from the College, For years they
have backed Grinncll's teams with
money and iii spii They have done
this without seeing most 01 the cone
tests themselves The institution has
lelt gratetul to them and has been
glad to change the date oi the last c0n~
test so they could attend,

The business men, too, have sacri-

‘ficed some in order to see'the game.

It is hard tor a man to close his ear
tahlishment {or even a brief time. But
this was done yesterday (or a Few
hours with a spirit which shows much
saeri ee. The business men. too,
hmught their hand with them to lend
active support to the team. They
marched to the field in a body and
yelled as much as anyone (or a Gi'inr
nell victory.

The College slluultl,#yes, does~ap-
preciate this support. Local merchants
should be given llreterence by stile
dents in every way possible. Giiitnell
