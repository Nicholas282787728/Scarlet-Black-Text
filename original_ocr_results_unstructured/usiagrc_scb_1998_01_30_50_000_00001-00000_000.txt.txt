Community members speak out against racism
Prominent Grinnell Leaders Issue DiversityAwareness Statement

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

On January 15, 1998, a statement
signed by representatives of the Grinnell
City Council, Human Rights Commis-
sion, Ministerial Association and other
area organizations was released to the
public. The declaration, entitled DIVEV'
siry Awareness Slatemem, affirms the
dedication of these institutions to racxal
harmony and condemns the actions taken
Halloween night 1997, when one or more
individuals painted racial slurs on a car
belonging to a Grinnell student, an incir
dent that was first reported in the Grinr
nell College Scarlet and Black.

Lolya Lipchitz of the Grinnell Human
Rights Commission, learned about the
incident after reading an article about it
in the November 21 edition of the Scarlet
and Black and brought it up at the next
meeting according to Grinnell Human
Rights Commission Secretary Donald
Schild.

“We wanted to make it clear that the

opinion of thc city and the city leaders is
that the terms ofthe language and the use
of language is disgusting," said Schild.
“We felt we needed to reinforce the idea
that racism and anything implying or cone
doning racism isn't acceptablc,,,we
wanted to say this as loudly and as
strongly as wc can soanyone who would
think to the contrary would be brought up
short."

Ted Mokricky, Chairperson of the
Grinnell Area Chamber of Commerce,
signed the statement.

“We felt that this unfortunate incident
did not and does not represent the C0m~
munity at large,” said Mokrtcky. “We felt
that a strong statement was warranted and
necessary." Mokricky first learned about
the incrdent from Dori Schild cfthc local
Human Rights Commission. Out of cone
cern for the situation, he brought up the
incident during a November Chamber
meeting. It was there the Chamber (lee
cided to get in touch with other area
groups and hold a dialogue.

BY MARGARET FRANCE

The 100 days
party ranks in many
minds as the second
most antICipated SE,
nior event, with
graduation as the un»
contested pinnacle.
From 10pm until
2am at The Down
Under Pub on Satur-
day, February 7,
Grinnell seniors will
find out if the party
lives up to the hype.

The Senior Weck
Committee believes
attendees will not be
disappointed. “We’re all set," Derek
Daniels ’98 said, “We've got the door
prizes, DJ, food, and alcohol. All that has
to happen now is the party.” Daniels and
Kendra Brown '92 emphasized that Inuch
ofthe responsibility for the 100 days party
rests on the students, as the college do-
Hales only the money to pay the DJ and
security. Alcohol and food are purchased
by the money raised through ticket sales.

Traditionally, the 100 days party is the
only gathering planned by the Senior
Week Committee that excludes all stile
dents other than graduating seniors, setr
ting them loose for an orgy of alcohol,
food, and debauchery away from the pry—
ing eyes of underclassmen.

Martin Luther King Day

BY RYAN OLSON

AND DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writers

This semester, Grinnell
College students returned to
campus to begin classes on
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
for the second consecutive
year

The holiday has often oc—
curred during the college’s
winter break in the past. Only
recently has the issue of giv-
ing students a holiday come
up. “The current academic cal:
endar is decided by the fac-
ulty." interim President
Charlie Duke said, but ”things
are in motion.”

The Executive Council. the
main body of faculty recom-
mending policy at the college,
asked the Committee on Aca-
demic Standing to look into
the possibility of considering
having Martin Luther King, Jr.

Day as a holiday. he explained.

“The main reason that I can think of
for us not declaring this day as a holiday
until now is simply the fact that it has not
been a factor until recently," Duke said.
Frank Thomas, Vice President of Human
Resources, said that “the college has only
recognized Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
as a holiday for approximately -the past
two or three years."

Dr. King’s holiday was made ofﬁcial
in 1986 after lobbyists worked for more
than 15 years to gain recognition for the
civil rights activist.

While the administration and support

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

staff of the college were given January

ulty members were expected to attend
classes.

Local businesses and schools likewise
remained closed in honor of Dr. King.

Martin Luther King, Jr. day is just one
ofseveral national holidays during which
class is held. Earlier in the academic year,
students protested having to attend class
on Labor Day with a banner out srde of
Carnegie Hall. Presidents Day and Co-
lumbus Day are 1ikewtse not observed.

Dr. King was honored by a vigil and
by a ﬁlm presentation on January 19.
