, rinnell grad makes good

by David Green
As the early morning mist rose
irom Rosenbloom Field, the
iamiliar sight or a red 13er truck
"oounced over the hill As the
student population slept, the real
working segment oi our lovely
community among the corn was
returning irom their coiiee break.
{Conspicuous among the crew,
which had been painting the lines
on the iootbail iield, was the [or
mer Pioneer pulling, guard from
Knoxville, 1a., Dennis Walters. i,
like the rest of the campus, wanted
to know what a ’76 economics
graduate was doing cleaning up
alter the rest oi us.
Why, aiter lour years at spilling
his guts on the iield, was Dennis

‘tteadying it tor a new generation oi‘

. oad-pounders? More importantly,
‘Qwhy spréidilme and cut shrubbery
alter eight semesters oi wits
matching with the likes oi Voertr
man, Dawson, et all Dennis‘s‘
igplanation oi events is a simple
s une. He spent his
traveling and happened to be
passing through Grinnell in mid-
August.»A temporary BSzG position
was open and rather than lace
unemployment, Dennis opted ior
his current position.

As is typical oi all Grinnell
grads, Dennis is motivated by a
burning desire to test his wings
outside the womb WE'VE come [0
call Grinnell College. He’s hoping

r a position in sales and market
research with a large corporation.
Dennis views being around the

allege as a great help in terms oi

vailability to job leads and

employment resources, He is
continuing to establish contacts
and send out letters and resumes in
his spare time.

Although he certainly would
have liked to have had a job with
more permanence by now, Dennis
tloes not regret being in the
situation in which he now linds
himselfl He believes there are
worse places to “‘tide one’s time”

-while pursuing a more permanent
career. Dennis has also enjoyed

the new perspective irom which he
is currently viewing the campus,
its students, and the town The
student body has treated Dennis’s
returnawith a bit of surprise and
amazemeiat J—le iully expects that
the people on campus
cannot at all comprehend-whyhe's
doing- what he’s doing. Personally,
however, Dennis feels good about
his situation and has every ex—

pectotion oi arriving at something -

tying within a
reasonable period or time,
Dennis declined to say what he
would do come October 1, when
this job ends. He does have a iew
employment possibilities pending.
For now, he is content to continue
working, and assisting with the
coaching of the Grinnell Eleven.
Like too many oi Grinnell’s recent
graduates, Dennis has had to re
evaluate his quest lor fame, [ore
tune. and the American dream.
But hope springs eternal in the
heart oi this mustachioed ex~jock,
and a prospective employer could
do worse than raid the ranks oi

Veggies trip to MI U

hy t\in‘.liida Amend

On Sunday night, Sept. 12. a very
small group oi people met with
iood service manager Dave Mc-
Connell to discuss the vegetarian
iood program, The meeting was
advertised ill the 5&8 and We had
hoped to draw a crowd oi
vegetarians large enough to
represent our numbers and needs,
but uniortunately only seven oi us
were here. Our small numbers
prohi led a discussion 01 Grins
nell’s general vegetarian needs,
but we were able to plan a trip to
Maharishi international
University in Fairlield, Iowa, to
examine their extensive
vegetarian program.

On Tuesday morning. Sept, 21,
Dave McConnell, Helen 110“",
Quad's head night cook Vcl'a
Dccdrick, and i left [or MIU We
arrived just beiore lunch and were
warmly received by the iood
service stall and their manager,
Marcus Lehrman, who gave us a
tour of MIU‘s iood facilities and
oliered to share any recipes and
cost analyses which could help
improve our program. We all were
struck by the diilerences between
our two iood services. Although
MIU does not have our variety of
hot entrees at each meal, they have
a lengthy list or cold ioods always
available whlch they call their
“absolute menu ” Believe it or not,
this includes condiments, spreads,
beverages. and dairy products
such as yoghurt and cream cheese,
home-made breads, melons.
plumsc; nectarines, peaches,

Agrap’esubananas, iresh pineapple,

prunes, sunﬂower seeds, soy nuts,
homemade granola, nut butters
made from almonds. cashews and
tahini, apple butter, jams, iresh
apple juice, herb teas,- and bins oi

oranges, carrdts,,and celery for ‘

juicing in the vegetable juicers
located thruughouk the room.
These ‘are only some or the ioods
available on this ”absolute menu."
The Complete list numbers about
sixty items av 'lahte at each meal.

In addition td these foods, a
“Variable menu" of hot enhees is
prepared. Lunches are light, and
include a vegetarian soup, breads,
vegetables, and a selection of cold
meats tor the meat eaters We had
a delicious lunch of soy bean chili,
creamed corn. iresh yoghurt
salads, steamed green beans, roast
bee}, hardboiled eggs, and a
seemingly endless quantity or
iresh [iuits Dinner meals are

 

more hearty. contain more hot
ioods, and usually center around
an internauional iood lheme, with
each night ieoturing meat and
vegetarian recipes irom a dlfierenl
country

We were all eager to know how a
school with a student body ap»
proximately the same size as ours
could allord in offer so many
natural. unprocessed ioods. The
answer lies in the homogeneity oi
the Student body and in the food
budget.

Over half the students at MIU
are vegetarians. and most
everyone is concerned with cating
natural ioods Thus the money is
Channeled into li‘esh lruits, nuts.
and grains. which they buy in
t antitics large nough to allow
l lativcly low prices, MIU spends
three times as much money per
week on fresh fruits alone than on
all of their meat products Com-
bined, In fact. Lehrman orders ten
tons ol iresh lruits and vegetables
irom Calilornia and live tons from
st. Louis each week' The cooking
s‘aii grinds lite flour to make their
breads and makes 300 gallons of
yoghurt each week. Sprouts were
in demand, so Marcus designed a
sprouting room which can produce
so gallons of sprouts each day

Unlortunately a program like
this requires money. Students at
MIU pay $125 each month in board
lees. Obviously we have cone
siderably less to work with than
they do. Nevertheless our visit
gave us many ideas to help us
improve our, system andtLehrman
has circled;to=belp us in’any'way
that he can. He will come to
Grinnell early in October to
analyze our iood service and to
bring recipes irom the MIU
program.

Several of his suggestions seem
fea ' For example, it may be

tom ke,,yoghurt in large
2 entities to serve at every
meal. Sprouts may he possible il,an,

l leel our trip was successiiil
Above all else it showed us that our
new iood service manager is
genuinely interested in providing
sound vegetarian menus and is
eager ior any comments that we
may have, 1 hope this knowledge
will inspire some constructive
suggestions
