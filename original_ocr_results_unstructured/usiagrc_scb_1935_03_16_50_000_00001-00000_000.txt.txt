Audience Pleased
With Presentation
of Co-ecl Concert

By Richard Kuncl

Two songs of a light. delicate nature,
Warren’s “Sunset" and Blum's "Sum.
mer Night,” opened the program given
by the Women's Glee club last eve.
ning in Herrick chapel. The women
made an impresive picture as they sang
from the setting of pines, and with
the entire chapel darkened, the lights
focused on them gave a perfect unity
of effect.

The Chippewa lndian Song, “Caig.
wa Nilnadja” was the most distinctive
in that it was so obviobuly different
from the rest of the program. One
could understand what great care was
taken to work out its finish and exact.
ness of rhythm.

Humorous Selection

The title of the song which follow.
ed, "Frog Went A Courting," is funny
in itself; the club gave the Song the
amusing interpretation it desired, and
it proved good entertainment.

Elias Blum’s ability as a composer
again came to the fore when the club
sang as its closing number, a selection
from he “Romany Rode.” The aud.
ience was able to get only a taste of
what must be a delightful operetta.
The composition was well done.

Soloisls Please

Margaret Wesson, Marion Kregel,
Alice Ebeling, and Elizabeth Shoul.
berg added to the program by contri.
buting pleasing solo work. Marion
Kregel did her best work with Nogero's
“My Love Is A Dashing ..Mulc(eer."
Mary Meneray’s harp selections were
likewise. meritable. » it is »not often
Grmnell audiences are fortunate
enough to hear desirable harp music.

The club’s director, George L. Pierce,
should be complimented on the assidu.
ous work which centeinly must have
been necessary to present so satisfao.
tory an evening's entertainment.

French Students

to Give Program
Thursday Night

The Trench club will present an eve.
ning of entertainment including a club
play, “Un PouPourri Printanier," a
ventriloquist act, a juggling and
tumbling exhibition, two singing tries
and an interpretative dance on next
Thursday evening at 8 o'clock in the
quadrangle little theater according to
George 0. Seiver, assistant professor

The program, as anounced today, is:

ard; a juggling and tumbling act by

Holman. Elsa Carlen and Mary Louise
Pine, Sabeth Mix; Jean M. Smith and

Dickens
to Illustrate Lecture
With Sketches

Payne, Authority,

Edward E. Payne, president of the
Boston Branch of the Dickens Fellow.
ship and author of “Dickens Days in
Boston," will appear on tho Crinnell
college lecture course on April 22,
Prof. Edward B. T. Spencer, chairman
of the lecture committee announced
yesterday.

The George w. Britt Co. who arrange
the engagements for lVLl'. Payne. state
that his lecture will be presented in
an entirely new manner. In one hour
and a half, advance information states,
he sketches eight graphic portraits in
color, three by four feet in size, of
famous Dickens characters, following
each one with a brilliant reading in
Dickens own words. As he draws,
Mr. Payne offers a running fire of in.
teresting information on Dickens, his
illustrators, character sources, and
methods of work, the information con.
tinues.

The eight characters whom the ar.
tist will sketch include Mr. Pickwick
and Serjeant Buzfuz from “Pickwick
Papers.” Mrs. Gamp, Wilkins Micaw.
ber, Mrs. Micawber, Uriah Heep and
Dora from “David Copperfield," and
Old Scrooge from “A Christmas Carol."
The "colored crayon sketches are to
remain the property of the college.

“The increased interest in the work
of Charles Dickens, probably stimulat.
ed by the recent motion picture of
David Copperfield." Mr. Spencer states,
is largely the ream for the lecture
committee's choice of Mr. Payne as the
next speaker." The increased furore
is also partly attributable to the dis.
covery of Dickens unpublished manu.
script and its publication in March,
1934. This manuscript, “The Story of
Our Lord" brought $200,000, to the
writer’s heirs for the right to publish
it.

“Mr. Payne’s lecture has been pro.
nounced of great interest by many
clubs and societies and his appear.
ance in Grinnell is a distinct addition
to the Grinnell lecture course,“ Mr.
Spencer slated.

sibilities of organizing such a club, and

ities for leadership which it held.

ganization was taken, the men present

cations for membership and the poten.
tialities of the club. A committee con.
sisting of Kent Duncan, Paul Bilken.
Julius Bauer. Roger Moon, and Rich.

Board of Trustees Adopted Official
Name of Grinnell College in 1909

Old Name of Iowa College
Confused With Title
of State Schools

ln case you are doubtlul about the
name of the institution you are at.
tending, having seen the local insti.
tution referred to as lowa college in
official documents and on diplomas,
rest assured. Gririnellians, rest assur.
ed: The official name of your alma
mater is Grinnell college.

President J. H. T. Main recommend.
ed in his report to the board of trus.
tees for the year 1808.09 that the name
be changed. He based his proposal on
the findings of a committee which had
studied needed changes in the college.

Trustees Adopt Proposal

The board of trustees adopted Main’s
proposal in 1909, and the college was
officially rc.named Grinnell, though
the mistces retained their original
name, “The Trustees of Iowa College.”

The change, it appears. merely made
official 3 name which had been in
general use for a number of years.
In citing reasons for the adoption of
the new name. President Main spoke
of "the growing popularity throughout
the state and elsewhere/of the name
‘Grinnell Coliegc.’ "

Conflict in Catalog

1n Lhe college catalogs. the prepara.
tory school which was operated in
connection with the college was known
as the Grinncll Academy, and the

 

music department was called the Grin.
nell School of Music, rather than the
Iowa College School of Music.

“For a decade the name Grinnell
college has been used in athletics,"
he stated.

There was also a desire to prevent
Grinnell from being mistaken for a
state school. The report describes a
”growing confusion arising from the
ambiguity of the name ‘Iowa College.’
The three state institutions Contribute
to this confusion; namely, the State
University of lowa, Iowa State college
at Amos, and the lowa State Teachers
College at Cedar Falls."

Confusion of Names

That this confusion might have prov.
ed embarrassing to the college is
shown by the [act that President
Mains report indicated a “desire to
release the college from all suggestion
of state limitation and obligation, that
it may more easily create an oduc..
tional commonwealth of its own, Sim.
ilar, for example. to that of Oberlin,
Eeloit, Amherst, Princeton. and many
others."

Finally, in the amended articles of
incorporation and reincorporation,
which were adopted in 1909. that name
of the corporation was iixed as “The
Trustees of lowa College," and its ob.
ject, “To continue the maintenance,
management, and support of the col.
legc at Crinneli. lowa, heretofore
known as lowa College, and which
shall hereafter be known and main.
tained by this corporation as Grinnell
college."

 

Faculty Alters
Rules on ‘Cuts’
for Next Year

Regulations in regard to absences
from classes were altered to permit
unlimited cuts for junior and senior
students who excell in their work, and
to reduce the number of absences
without penalty for students in regular
standing at a meeu‘ng of the faculty
committee this week.

The revised rule as adopted by the
faculty states that “juniors and seniors
who make ‘A’ or ‘B' grades in all
courses for one semester shall not be
penalized for absences in the follow.
ing semester. This privilege does not
excuse the student from taking an.
ncunced tests or from attending classes
and meeting other appointments when
required by the instructor. Absences
shall be recorded and reported (or all
students.”

in addition, a ruling was adopted to
provide "tliat the number of absences
without penalty be reduced from 18
to 15 for students in regular standing.”
The penalty, for exceeding the new
limits of 15 cuts will be a reduction
of the total credit toward graduation
by one semester hour.

The remainder of the rules which
deal with absence because of illness
or membership in organizations are to
remain as before.
