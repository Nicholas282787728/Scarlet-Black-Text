What‘s with the ashtrajLaround the neck?

How to impress
the wine steward

by Jeff Phelps

You are seated in a dandy
restaurant preparing to order,
when a gentlcperson with a silver
ashtray slung ‘round the neck ap—
pears with a wine list. You ask
for help making a selection for
your dinner, and the ashtray per-
son slips off to retrieve the per-
fect Wine. The aseray person
returns, opens the bottle, presents
the cork for your inspection, and
waits. From here it's up to you
to decide whether to accept the
Wine or not.

First off, the ”ashtray" is 30
tually a “tastcviw,” an ancient
tasting device with little redccmr
ing social value, but it does sig-
nal the presence ofa “sommelier”
or wine steward—someone who
should really know about wine.
When the sommclier returns with
the wine and presents a cork.
don't just smell it; look it over.
(You will smell cork and oxidized
wine—something you would ex
pect such a plug to smell like.
Smelling the cork is relatively
useless forjudging wine health or
quality.) The cork should be
moist at the wine end and spongy
or ﬁrm rather than dry, crumbly,
or moldy. Dry and crumbly
means poor storage and, usually,
oxidized wines. Mold on the
outside top of the cork is no
problem, but on the wine side, it
can mean trouble. Log the cork‘s
condition to memory, but base

your final judgment on the wine
itself.

The wine should look clear in
the glass (a few particles are
okay. but cloudiness or a filmy
surface is not), have a nice color
(no brown edges for either whites
or reds), and should smell like
wine rather than vinegar, burnt
sugar, or sulfur. If it stinks, rc-
ject it.

Next, take a sample in your
mouth and really work it overi
i.e., chew, slosli. gargle, etc.
You may not know what you are
doing this for (wine classes, anyr
onci), but it sure will look good!
Actually, you are bringing the
wine in contact with all of the
sensory contact points in the
mouth. Here you can judge
sweetness, acidity, astringency,
and balance as well as overall
taste. Most restaurants will let
you reject a wine if it tastes bad
to you. but don‘t get carried
away. Reject a second wine on
personal taste and you may get to
meet the owner. You most cer-
tainly will be expected to prove a
problem exists with the wine.

A good sommelicr will not
screw up many recommenda—

An Everyday Revolution:
TheCEnnneHExpenence

by JeffPeircc
This Monday, April 24, at
7:30 pm. in South Lounge, the
students in Kcsho Scott‘s Social
Movements in the 20th Century
class will perform "An Everyday
Revolution: The Grinnell
Experience.” The evening will be
filled with many multi-media
g skits written by students to
it illustrate the various aspects of
3 social movements and how those

‘3 aspects relate to the Grinnell

and some may even knowingly
recommend just plain bad wine.
You can gain the upper hand by
turning down smelly wines,
brown wines, or ones with
crumbled corks. The Somme-
lier‘s next choice will almost
certainly be much better.
Remember, the more you ex-
periment, the easier it will be for
you to pin down your own tastes
and explain them to wine stew—
ards. They’re interested in satis-
fying your needs because they
want you to keep coming back—
with money.
Next time we‘ll talk about
vintages and what they should
mean to the wine drinker.

 

Eagle Feather

Continued from Page 3

However, despite people’s diverse
cultures and different colors and
languages, Eagle Feather reminds
us that "we’re all brothers and
sisters” and we can all enjoy a
good story.

Eagle Feather ends his shows
with silent poems. “Our society
is always making noise," he ex-
plains. “People should enjoy the
silence; s something we need

forms the poems using North
American signs he teamed from
deaf children. The audience must
learn to read his signs in order to
understand the story. By teaming
the signs, people learn about
others. “The U.S. has an elitist
attitude. We refuse to learn other
ways of thinking" such as other
languages, says Eagle Feather.
Subsequently, “we lose out on an
opportunity for richness.“

Eagle Feathcr's Mayan back
ground is apparent in his hand-
inade clothing from Guatemala.

He wears beads around his neck
and a headband adorned with a
single black-and-whitc eagle
feather. The eagle feather’s con-
trasting colors symbolize the
“union of opposites such as male
and female, black and white, good
and evil, all combined in the
Great Spirit." In a bag he carries
crystals, which he says are
“intensificrs of energy." “Modern
society," he points out, “has also
discovered the wonders of Crysr
this.” After talking with Floating

Eagle Feather, it seems modern
society could learn a lot from this
wise man.

5 College community.

The class has surveyed many
social movements including the
Russian, Chinese, and Viet-
namese revolutions. In addition.
they have also studied the
women’s movement in this
country and the gay and lesbian
movements worldwide. The class
has examined deﬁnitions and the—
ories of social movements and
how these deﬁnitions and theories
provide a cross-cultural perspec-
tive of the goals. ideologies, and
development of social move
ments inside and beyond the
boundaries of the United States.

The students have taken the

knowledge they have gained from
analyzing social movements and
on Monday night will present
that knowledge to the campus
community. Through their pre-
sentations, the students hope to
illustrate how the mechanisms
which create and propel social
movements are part of everyday
life here in Grinnell. “An
Everyday Revolution: The Grin-
nell Experience" is following in
the footsteps of last year's
“Reversing Invisibility"
presentation, another Kesho Scott
production. Some of the skits
will be humorous and light.
while others will be serious and
extremely powerful. The class is
attempting to stimulate discus-
sion among the campus commu-
nity by exposing the community
to a new and diverse set of ideas
and philosophies. The students
hope that the audience leaves the
presentation with a sense of
“WOW! That was some neat
stuff! That was also some deep
shit!“ and hence Start discussions
among different sections of the
college contmunity.

Senior Challenge
committee formed

For the second Straight year,
Grinnell’s graduating senior class
will be attempting to reach the
50 percent mark for giving to the
college’s Annual Fund drive.

All gifts of at least'one dollar
given to the Annual Fund by
members of the Class of 1989
will be matched by fiverdollar
contributions from members of
the college‘s Alumni Board. If
more than 50 percent of the class
donates, the matching pledges
froth the Alumni Board will in»
crease to ten dollars.

Although programs like the
Senior Challcnge have existed for
many years at other colleges and
universities, last year was the
first time that Grinnell had been
issued such a challenge. The
class of 1988 met the challenge,
with 54 percent participation and
gifts of about $1000. Adding in
the matching gifts, the total con-
tribution to Grinnell’s Annual
Fund was close to $2000.

The 1989 Senior Challenge
Committee is a group of students
from almost every academic ma-
