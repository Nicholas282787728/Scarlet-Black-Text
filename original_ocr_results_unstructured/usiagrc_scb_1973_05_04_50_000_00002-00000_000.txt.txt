SAGA Workers Pny Rolsed

The recently announced pay in-
crease for SAGA workers, from
$l.60 to $1130 per hour, was long
overdue according to some college
olticials.

Director of Student Financial Aid
D. Nicholas Ryan explained that
SAGA jobs are ”physically more
demanding and thereiore less desire
able” than many other student jobs.

He added that the privilege of Cut—
ting long tood lines, long an attracr
tion of working for the food service,
was no longer much ot an incenr
tive since extended dining hall hours
have cut lines to a minimum.

will cost between $8,000 and Eli),

lines. The plan involves enclosing
open ditches and extending and imr
proving or existing storm sewers.

Donald Lamhle, Vice-Presidentfor
Business, termed the coliege'scon-
tributlon “very generous” and cited
it as an effort on the part of the
College ”to take a responsibility
in the community."

Though Grinnell has relatively na-
tural drainage, water has been ac—
cumulating in the area bounded by
the football field and college Pref
sident’s house making these areas
on many occasions unmowahle anda
haven for frogs and mosquitos. The
new storm sewers hopetully will
improve the drainage north or the
college and clear out stagnant water.

gaining “college recognition that
the Free University is worth so-
mething."

Even though it is only in the ini-
tial organizational stages, MS.
Yacknln expressed [aith in its suc—
cess here at Grinnell saying that
free university programs “have Wo—
ried out successlully at other sch-
ools.” Ms. Yacknln expects the
organizational work to continue the
rough the rest or this semester and
the summer months in order tor a
list of Courses to be available to
the students at registration next

Ms, Yacknin said there is a pos-

sibility that the crait workshops
