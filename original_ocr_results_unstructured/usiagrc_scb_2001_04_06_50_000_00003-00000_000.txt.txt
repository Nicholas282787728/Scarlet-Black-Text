Remodeled bookstore looks to incoporate coffee service new anli- -shop|ifting policy

by David Nathan
Staff Writer

The Grlnncll college Booksrorc completed the rust ora two part
renovation over spring break, Over the vaearron, wooden shelving,
which had previously stood on the upper level or the bookstore was
moved to the lower level and planed along the walls to make way for
new furniture upstairs. Glass shelving. which had previously been set
in The wall and could not bear nearly as much weight as The wood
shelves, wn removed. New bookshelves now sTand on The ﬁrsT ﬂoor,
along WiTh several mushroom shaped Tabla Arr, ofﬁce and school
supplies are now located on the lower level. Clothing, esrds, magar
zrnes, snacks, drinks software, gift items, geneml reading reference
books, and other, non required reading now sit on thcupper level

”For a long trme. people risked why we didn't have books near the
door," said bookstore manager Cassie Wherry. “People have wanted
The bookstor: To look more like a booksrorc. In The Master Plan, There
were plans To icilomrc in The funlre, but ,.whcn new bookshelves bar
crime available, we decided nor To Wait around."

For the price or transportation, Grinnell received several stylish
new bookshelves from University Book and supply a private book
store serving the University or Town mmpus in Iowa City, Wherry

:gcmcnr association. When she was offered Their furniTurc for free, site
rumpecl at the chance, “Fittures are very expensive,“ said Wherry. "For
less than the cost orbuying one shclf, we gor'scvci-nl."

The second phase or the renovation will take plate over summer.
The window displays will be removed and a new cnférlike space will be
added in Their place. Chairs and Tables will be broughr in, and colicc
from dinning serviees may be made available to read and study in,

Wherry isn't sure how well eolrec and paperbacks will mix on in
rhe store, but still wants to give the coiree shop atmosphere a try. "I
Think being able To siT down wiTh a clip ofcoffcc and a book near The
window Is a nice idea," she said. "We’ll see how it goes."

The bookstore also recently changed its policy on bringing book
bags and backpacks into the shop. Instead of requiring customers to
leave their bags outside, the stair now asks that visitors keep their bags

imam: such a negative thing," said Wherry. "We’d spend more time
tracking down people wiTh backpacks than helping eustomers.”

The Grinnell College Bookstore employs tour full time and eight
part time workers. The store hires around three students everyApril to
ﬁll vacancies leh by graduzring seniors and students who will be oiir
campus next fall. Interested parties should inquire at the bookstore
during its regular business hours,

All in all, Wherry is pleased with the renovation. "1 think it looks
natural, like it’s always been like this." The bookstore now looks more
like one. and the start and management hope it will better serve both
the college and town community Than it has been able to in the past."
