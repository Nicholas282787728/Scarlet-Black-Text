er THE beginning ot another
school year must be closely linked
the opening of another season ot
society work. and the close of the
week will see all the college litel-
ary societies in active operation,
That this work is important goes
without saying. The training ac-
quired in writing, in extempora-
neous work and in debate. forms a
valuable part in any student's col-
lege course. In days gone by we
have failed in our duties in this
respect, and as a result Cornell
has carried off the joint debate
fortwnyearsinsuccession. SCAR-
LET AND BLACK strongly urgcs
upon all students, old and new, to
get into the harness and make this
year of society work the most
prosperous in the history ot the
college. It is a matter to which
we cannot afford to be indifferent.
either individually or as a college.
The work which the literary socie-
ties of an institution do has al-
most the same weight in deter-
mining the standing at that insti-
tution as its athletics, and this
should not be forgotten.even while
we are straining every nerve tor
victory on the gridiron. Let us
strengthen our weakest points and
work all the more earnestly to se-
cure success in that department in
which we have most often met
defeat.

Now THAT the mole-skins and
shin-pads have begun to make
their appearance on the ﬁeld of
battle. the question of turning out
a winning team for Grinnell this
season has assumed its customary
importance. In no way can the
success of the team be better in-
sured than by providing a good
coach, and this has already been
done by the management, Mr.
Harris is already well known to
the old students and alumni. and
they are all glad to see him in
charge ot the team another year.

A paper is now being eireiilat.
ed among business men and stur
dents to secure the
to provide for Mr. I’lal‘ris's ex~
penses while he is with us. It is
needless to say that this is one
manner in which the students can
show their interest in athletics in
Iowa College. Although every
one may not be able to give a
largesum,everyonccancontribute
something to help the good cause
along. Every student should be
ready to do all in his power when
the paper s presented to him.

wherewithal

ALTHOUGH 11‘ is well that the
students should take a great in-
terest in football. they should not
entirely forget track athletics. as
very many seem to have done so
far this season. Some of the old
men have been out working l'egue
larly for the last week, but very
few new men have shown up.
This isa very important branch
of athletics and all those who
hope to win or to see the team
wiiiin the spring should lose no
time in getting into practice and
doing what they can toward se-
curing the victory at the next
ﬁeld-day, The training done this
{all will have a decided effect on
the team's ivn ncxtspring. This
is the ﬁtting time for new men to
make their ﬁrst appearance since
the older ones are less absorbed
in their own training and can give
more attention to the worlc of the
new candidates. The annual fall
ﬁeld—meet, which takes placethis
year on October 22:] is especially
designed to accustom new men
to taking part competitive
games and it is hoped to have a
full list of entries this fall. Every-
one, theretore, who has any in.
elination for track work, even
though he has never done any
thing in that line before. should
not tail to appear at Ward Field
at four ﬁfteen each afternoon
and take such work as the track
captain shall direct.

There seems to be some trouble
in the medical department at s.
U. I. The class of 1900 medics
had sixtyeone members last year
ot whom only twenty returned
this fall. and nine of those after
their arrival in Iowa City left for
Chicago. The cause of the dis
turbance lies with one member of
the faculty.

On Friday S. U. I. will hold a
tennis tournament to decide who
will represent them in the fall
