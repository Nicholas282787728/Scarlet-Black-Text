This year's I‘lomecomingpnarks the end
an era in the Grinnell story which future
,storians of the college will welcome as a
nral division point. To those now reeen—
ed following the end of the war it means
ng old friends and classmates, whose
l- eseiice on the campus will form a con-
ir: ting link with the war and prewar year .
But this year marks a beginning. not
‘r of another century, but of Grinnell’s

IntellectualS?

“Before an audience of 1500 people. . .
So ran the frontep go De Moiiies Tribune
article last night reporting the Hambro
speech. 1300 people? If that was 1500 peo-
ple, we’d like to see the figure when the
rest of the school was in attendance!

Just exactly where was everybody yes-
terday morning .’ No football games were on.
no, not cyen a world’s se "es. Who has to be
speaking to attract the “intellectual“ Grin-
nell student? Was a couple of hours too
long to spend listening to a man who had
something important to say? Or was the
call 01' the sack or the White Spot too much”!

We know exactly what you’re thinking.
"Who is the S S: B, to tell me where to go
and what to do. Do they think they coin—
pr se the o‘ y people on campus who think. ’
No, dear friends, we don’t, nor do we claim
to be. The whole point of this little piece
is this: Don’t you in all honesty think that
when someone of Hambro‘s calibel is me
seated right here on campus that the least
we could do is attend just to see u hat he’s
like for our own benefit? Or wouldn’t we
learn anything?

Here was a man who has been the
leader of Norwegian politics for decades,
led the Norwegian resistance
from England, served for many years as

dent of the League of Natio; . and

s the Norwegian delegate to the United
Nations. We could to on for paragraphs
about his offices. His political prominence
might be compared to that of Willkic or
Eyihes,

We think it’s a slap in the face to the
school, the alumni, and especially to our
selves, the student body, that we don‘t take
more interest when such “men with a
message” appear on our own campus. If a
man has a 5 0d ”billing” g e yourself
break and listen awhile, If after a few
minutes on l'ind ll’ speech boring, it's
your pri\ilcge to wall; out. Who knows,
might even be a goodspeaker.
