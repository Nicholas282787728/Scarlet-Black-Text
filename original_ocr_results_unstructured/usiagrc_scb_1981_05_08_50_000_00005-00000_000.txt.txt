Financial aid questions still unsolved

by Ellen Heath

The Admissions and Financial Aid
Office is still waiting to find out exactly
how much aid the iederal government
will allot to students and colleges next
year.

Meanwhile, the office has sent
preliminary aid proposals to Grinnell’s
students on financial aid to give them
some idea of their monetary situation
for the falLGovel'nment aid sources
have been, estimated along with
scholarships, loans and other college
based funds,

One government grant, the
Fell/Basic Grant tBEOG), has been
estimated very low. Last year the max
imum amount awarded to one student
through that grant was 31,750. This
year, the Financial Aid Office
estimated that ceiling at $1,250. Accor»
ding to John Hopkins, director of Ad-
missions and Student Financial Aid,
however, that estimate was probably
too low and the amounts cited on the
preliminary award letters may rise.
The government has begun to process
the BEOG and is sending letters to apr
plicants but Grinnell has not yet been
informed of the grant amounts.

The college also receives money trom
the government to dole out to students
as it determines need This aid is divid-
ed into three areas: National Direct
Student Loans (NDSL), Supplementary
Educational Opportunity Grants
(SE06) and awork-study programs.

But Hopkins said, “The thing I‘m
east concerned about is the college
Iased funds." He explained the govern-

ent allots funds to educational regions
-nd the schools apply for the tunds

ithin their region. Hopkins teels Grin
all will have less trouble getting this

oney than other schools in the Iowa
egion and one reason tor this is Grin-
ell's continuing increase in enroll

ent. Although he is tairly optimistic,

opkins said the financial aid workers
.nd recipients simply have to wait tor
he government decisions.

The estimated cut in the Grinnell aid
or the NDSL is about $27,000. Because
If this drop the college has instituted its
nwn loan program for seniors on aid. lnr

tead of receiving the NDSL, these
eniors will get a comparative loan
rom the college iselt. The government

oney will be used only tor

derclassmen.

The Office foresees a difference of

bout $33,000 for the SEOG between this

ear and next, Work-study aid will drop

pproximately 533,000. Work-study,

nds from the government are match-
: by Grinnell in the amount of 20 cents
n each dollar, but next year the college
ill add even more of its own funds to
at area to make up the deficit.

Hopkins explained that if the Finan-
cial Aid Oltice's estimates for the
government funding are off in the
award letters, the components that
make up the award will be adjusted but
the total will not change, For instance,
if the EEOC turns out to be less than ex7
pected, the college will make up the difr
ference in other areas but it will not cut
Hie total amount of the award.

The Ofﬁce suggests students inn
vestigate the Guaranteed Students
Loan (GSL) and the Parent Loan for
Undergraduate Students (PLUS) if
they feel their award is insufficient.
However, these loans are not a sure
way to get more funds. Hopkins said the
GSL will be fairly available throughout
the summer but that may change in the
fall. Students who have a GSL now
should take it to the Financial Aid Of-
fice immediately for certification,

The PLUS is a very doubtful source-of
college aid. Established last fall as a

way for parents to borrow money for
their children's education, Hopkins said
banks may not be receptive to this loan.
it obtained, payment or the loan begins
60 days after its dispersement.

Some students on aid are disap
pointed with the amount of their propos-
ed awards. Hopkins said that cases of
financial need are evaluated by person-
nel at Grinnell and not by computers as
with the government and explained,
“The human element is involved in
making judgments with regard to par-
ticular situations.” He feels the
students financial aid needs have been
correctly assessed,

Hopkins expressed his concern,
though, that because of the budget cuts,
particularly the EEOC, the college
financial aid department is so tighuy
budgeted that it cannot make
allowances for major family
catastrophes.
