Elimination of Saturday classes
is the major thrust of a new
proposal which will go to the
academic standing committee next
week. Mary Eysenbach, dean of
curriculum has presented a
possible new class schedule for the
academic year of ’76-’77.

Problems which the proposed
calendar should help to alleviate
are: classes bunching up into the
same time slots, science labs
pressed for time, scantily attended
Saturday classes, and the 12:00
iunchroom rush.. (Lunch periods
would be extended and classes
would be held from 11:00 to 1:00;
Students could then schedule a

c. Edwin Gilmour, professor of
political science and advisor for
the india Studies Program, has
returned to Grinnell after spending
a year in india, Mr. Gilmour held a
Fulbright visiting professorship at
the University of Bombay. In
addition to his duties of lecturing at
the University and supervising two
PhD candidates, he lectured at
eleven other colleges and
universities. He also traveled to
indian villages where he visited
governmenttinanced coops and
newlyrdeveloped irrigation
projects. He used a research grant
from Grinnell to study the effect or
lndian federalism on the lndian
party system. Mr. Gilmour had
two articles published in Indian
journals.

Mr Gilmour found the Visit a
positive and productive ex-
perience. He was able to continue
lriendships established during his
1970 visit, which was also on a

Abolish Saturday classes?

12: 0 class and cat at either 11-00

At a Monday night informal
meeting of the Joint Boards.
Eyescnbach said that one of the
questions which she asked herself
when putting the proposal together
was, “Arc Saturday classes
reasonable to schedule? I said
‘schedule' and not ‘hold.’ ” She
added, “lhere seems to be a con-
siderable difference in this area.”

The proposed Saturday class

India trip

Fulbright Fellowship Much of his
traveling was done on second-class
trains, where he and his wife were
able to meet Common Indians, and
on the socialized bus system,
where they met country people and
sometimes their chickens, Mr.
Gilmour says that he had never
meta more naturally friendly and
generous people than the lndians.

In addition to this natural
friendliness, urban Indians are
often interested in Americans
because of friends or relatives
studying in the US. However, their
view of our governmentis less than
positive. The lndian press is
generally antirAmcrican, a
position Mr, Gilmour sees as un-
derstandable. Indians feel that
India, the second power in Asia,
has been ignored by America.
There is a lack of understanding of
each other's foreign policy that has
caused disillusionment on the part
of lndians, especially in view of

afternoons they need more
available time slots for their
electives. They also said that a six
day week helps them to spread out
their work,

Another problem joint boards
members discussed is the
possibility of increased academic
pressure. The general consensus
was that things won't differ
considerably from the way they
are now.

The Eysebach proposal was
drawn up with an eye to the needs
of each differing department and
seems to have general faculty
support.

positive

recent diplomatic snubs.

The American pi-css distorts
lndian ncws, stressing natural
disasters and poverty and ignoring
the positive aspects of indian
society. For example, indians feel
that the Amcrican press has been
less then objective about the recent
limiting of personal freedoms by
Prime Minister Gandhi under the
Emergency.

Mr, Gilmour sees this as
illustrative of the unconscious
arrogance of Americans. who
apply Western standards to a non:
Western culture Through letters
from Indian friends, Mr. Gilmour
has found that the majority of the
urban elite, who are most affected
by the restrictions. are unhapp
about the Emergency but see it as
necessary to avoid chaos,

Mr, Gilmour found the trip ex-
tremely enjoyable and advises any
interested student to consider the
india Studies Program.
