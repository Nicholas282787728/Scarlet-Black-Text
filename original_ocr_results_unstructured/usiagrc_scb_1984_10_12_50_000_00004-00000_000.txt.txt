Scarlet and Black policy:
non-sexist language

The Editorial Staff of the Scarlet and Black announces
as of this issue that we will banish sexist language and
terminology from the 88:3 and will embark on a new
policy of non-sexist language contained with the 8 pages
of the 5&8. All writing of news, editorials, features,
sports, entertainment and even advertisements will be
thoroughly checked and edited of sexist language, Per—
sonals will continue to be untampered with.

We believe we have done reasonably well in the past,
but will make a more concerted effort, this semester.

sexist language can entail anything from the subtley
patriachical “chairman", “Congressmen”, to the blatant
reference to women as sex objects or incompetents (girl,
chick, bitch, slut, etc). Of most frequent misuse is the
assumption of maleness attributed to hypothetical people
(e.g.- “Let‘s say someone went to the store, would he be
better off walking or driving if..?). All such references
will be he/she or him/her, etc,

We hope this policy is understood as a step towards
elimination of sexism, and not some kind of radical
foolery. The importance of language in perpetuating sex-
ism cannot be emphasized enough. If anyone does not
understand the need for this policy of non-sexist
language, we encourage them to write letters to the
editor, or submit personal opinions for publication to the
5&3.

If you do find any sexist or otherwise offensive
reference in the 5&3. we ask that you bring it to our at-
‘ tentionsThank‘you. ‘ "

‘Grounds for thought’

b_\ Ellen Weinslock

Having joinied the many here
who are getting crabby as a result
of midsemester academic
pressure, 1 herewith prescnt a
bunch of gripes. Just ask. and
maybe they can be made into a
whine.

With the political situation boils
ing over as it's known to do almost
every four years. there are some
who still ask. "Why are you in
terested in politics?" It's nice that
they ask that. because it's usually
grounds [or a good long arugment
tone or those things we came to
college for), which really out to
begin with saying. "Why AREN'T
you interested in politics?"

In the old days oi Maniiest
Destiny. politics didn‘t matter a
lot, if one didn't like the way
things were being run. one could
move on West and do them dif-
ferently inote' this is not a
California jokel. If you don't think
politcs touch every tibcr on your
daily lite. now, though. you‘re kid-
ding yourseli,

You vloke up this morning, got
dressed, and went to breakfast.
What you dressed yourself in was
determined by us io'reign policy
toward Asia - whether or not those
jeans were assembled cheaply in
Hong Kong or made by unions
here determined their price and
the fibers used. it also helped
determine the balance of
payments and the unemployment
rate of textile workers here. The
temperature of your room was in
fluenced by OPEC oil prices and
how much energy the school could
altord to give you. which in turn
influenced the amount of tuition

you paid, What you ate was deter-
mined by myriad political deci-
sions - subsidies to milk farmers
the policital decision to build ma-
jor highways so your Florida
oranges could be transported to
you. and governmental actions to
keep water sources clean, to name
a few. it's 9 am and already
political decxsions have had an
enormous impact on your well-
being, Even it one adopts the
viewpoint that all human beings
are inherently self~intercsted and
nothing more. how can you afford
not to care"

but the women pictured saying
“Never say never toa man behind

one of the most damanging myths

isn't unreasonable to expect a

her dreadfully; 21 a woman
should do telethon because an

trigued by her voice and so the

As Queen Victoria said, "We are

‘Quoth the Raymond’

by Jen nay nioiiii

To be pcriectly honest. l was as
surprised as anyone when I read
in Tuesday's Des Moines Register
that Playboy was coming to town.

Well. not this town. but Des
Mornes is still pretty close for a
Playboy club. 1 certainly never
expected anything like this to
come along. But I guess Des
Moines is ready to step out.

You probably know . and ii you
don't. you should . that Playboy
came to Grinnell in the early part
0(1969 Yup, right here. and it you
don‘t believe me maybe you
should look at the nude photos
[kept in the College‘s archives)
that were taken here.

Playboy didn't want or expect
any nudity here, it wasn't a _ ‘irls
of the Midwest Conference" visit
that brought the magazine.
Rather a Playboy representative.
Bricc Draper. was invited to
speak on campus as part ot a cant
pas series on sex education To
protest the magazine's exploilar
tlull of women, six \ionleu and
four men stripped during
ui-apci-‘s talk

As it turned out. the protesters
vi crc not looked upon as licrocs by
other students but as "childish"
and "cxhlbltlomsis \\ ho ice] that ii
'sllockcr' is the most effective
means of getting their ideas

~As lhc alumni scuretr’
,JonL-s. \tl'olc. "l limit

a lot or ithe studentsl sympathize
with the idea that prompted the
protest but none of them accepted
the implementation used by thc
protestors."

And what do today's Grinncll
students think or the Playboy club
in Des Moines. scheduled to open
in November and hiring this
weekend.

I showed the advertisement that
appeared in \‘l cdncsday's
Heglsler to about one dozen of you
In a nonssclentific poll. The ad
showed a shapely bunny standing
under the headline, We Want You
to Audition to Become a Playboy
Bunny The ad went on to describe
the great life to be had by dolinlng
a revealing costume and bunny
ears and waiting on "inlerestlng
people" in the Des Moines club,

Nobody sccmcd too interested
in finding a ride to the Des l\lomes
Sheraton to take a shot at becom

one person who is enthusiastic
about the whole thing is Mark

Des Moines Club. According to
Tuesday's Register. Guilds exs
