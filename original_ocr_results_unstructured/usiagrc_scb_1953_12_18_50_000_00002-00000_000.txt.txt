’Blest Be This Tie?

The_jobs of treasurers and business managers of many
actlwtles financed under the semester fee will be affected
by the latest pronouncement of the treasurer’s office.

. Most activities will suffer little because they will re—-
celve only 88 percent of the first semester’s fee—but, few.

will be enthusiastic about the possibility that total fund
distribution may not be completed for another year or two.

The treasurer’s office is right in determining'its prin-
ciple responsibility

Its primary job is to provide funds for education;
therefore it first collects tuition from working students
Since its secondary function is to pay for living costs of
the student body, the room and board fees ”are collected
second. Its final responsi lity is to the extraneous student
funds (social and semester) which the office collects last.

However from the circumstances under which the
office’s action has placed acti'vity fund holders, a serious
question is raised for student consideration

Would it be more profitable for students to establish
a separate bank account holding the money designated for
student activities, rather than continuing to turn it over
to the treasurer? ' ‘

From the student point of view the separate account
seems‘ a better answer; from the stated policy of the treas-
urer’s office, such a suggestion might be favorably received
there as well.

This arrangement would give students complete con-
trol of their ﬁlnds; and would relieve the treasurer of the
job of handling them. However, the arrangement would
also necessitate an assumption of total responsibility by
the students, for the collection and distribution of funds.

Nevertheless. student funds handled'by students as

they see fit could be a very satisfactory solution, whatever,

the added responsibility.

Make It ‘Student’ .

Censorship has become an issue in the preparation
of the fifth annual student musical.

President Stevens and Dean Gardner both say that the
responsibility for the musical rests with the Social Calen—
dar committee, which is providing funds for the production
from the social fee.

As chairman of that committee, Dean Gardner seems
to feel that the script for the show should be read and
criticized by the faculty members of the committee and by
Dean Fuller. Whether this "criticism” would be tantamount
‘to censorship, no one is sure.

This is a “student" musical. It is being paid for by
student funds produced and directed by students, and spon-
sored by the Student Council. The only way to keep it a
truly student show is to give the students the complete re-
spo'nsibility of holding the show ,within the bounds of good

as e.

To accomplish this, the cial Calendar committee
must be relieved of its responsibility for the show by the
Student Council. It would be well if the Student Council
passed the responsibility to its producer and director.

The producer and director will need advice, both tech-
nical and literary, and they should seek that advice from
competent members of the faculty. But they should seek
out and ask persons of their own choice; and they should
be free to act, whether they choose to follow that advice

or ignore it. ,

It’s December 18, and everyone goes home tomorro .
That usually portends a joyous editorial Wishing everyone
a very Merry Christmas and a most Happy New Year.

But we’ve become weary of Christmas thisyear. The

street lamps have been leering at us, plastered with garish-
ly colored lights, since the Week before Thanksgiving. The
only real effect the holiday season has had so‘ far has been
.to deplete the contents of our never-very-full pockets.
V We aren’t very merry. True, we're getting out of
Grinnell for all of two weeks; but looking ahead we can
see the dog days between Christmas and spring vacation
grimacing as they await our arrival back, waiting for us
with a week of final exams and a month of readjustment
to a new class schedule.- . .

But there are a few of you with hearts brimming
with good cheer, and we hate to ruin your vacation. So,
Men‘y Christmas. And Happy New Year.

One thing is certain, the TV
lsct missing from the union
wasn’t stolen by practical jok-
ers. I've tried hard and long
lbut i can’t see the slightest bit

it was the only set on campus
the deed is even more odiiclus. If
students are involved‘ in the act
it will seem ridiculous to can»
clze the administration for not
,considcnng the students as mar
ture and responsible individuals.
However. rm inclined to believe
that outsiders took it.

I can't help feeling a on like

is over, and I feel like i was
looking absently outawindow,
watching clouds sweep overhead,
suddenly hearing the alarm
.clock tick, and noticing that the
|ash on ,my cigarette is long. in
spite of the momentous acts and
decisions that were supposed to
have been made this year, i
think that 1953 will iinaily go
down in history .as merely one
,0: the years in the interregnum.

Decision.

We can only be sure that'this
white Christmas and all the ones

haps it's a good thing.

It’s too easy to ﬁorget the
disappointments and inadequav
bias that also occurred in past
years. The future always has the
psychological advantage of being
empty of ,all except what we
read into it. The future does
in‘ot imply many absolute irre-
vocable facts, so we can exec»
‘cise our inherent human opti-
mism. Consequently, i am justis
field in wishing you, a “Happy
New Year!"

in the interest oi impartiality
i should mention the comment
An Borg made when i asked

lhlm what he thought about
iChristmas Vacation, etc. He said,

1“Scmogc‘ hail the right idea."

As Old Tom sez, ”You pays
lyer money and you takes yer
