We Audit the Books - -

This week Grinnell entered its hund-
redth year, free from the cloud under
which it had labored for the past four
years. While far from normal, the out-
look for the year ahead held no grim fears
of telegrams that in a few words could
wipe out the future; partings, though sad,
would not hold the weight of maybe
forever. The campus atmosphere seemed
different . . . the long, long waiting, the

>0fbpresent feeling of futility were gone.
We were at peace.

‘ Looking back over the war years, we
would not hold the weight of maybe
We had lost classmates who, by rights,
should someday walk down the aisle of
Herrick chapel with us to receive a degree.
Some of us had lost someone who meant
even more. Our pleasures had been cur-
tailed, the scope of activities narrowed.
We had been lonely for “the good old
days."

Yet we gained. We here in Grinnell
somehow learned to live together more
closely and with more harmony in the
years when nerves were strained and tem-

pers short. As classes grew smaller, each
person became more a person. Each pro—
fessor, with fewer demands upon his time,
became a friend. His knowledge became
available to every student who would take
advantage of it.

We learned to have fun with each
other. “Going out with the girls” was no
longer the plight of the undated, but a
real pleasure. We found that a sense of
humor and a fund of sympathy meant
more than a full date boolL We grew up.

Oh, the books don't balance. Never,
for what we gained, would we trade what
we lost. But the years ahead promise par-
tial repayment. It is to be hoped that we
will 'not wipe the books clean and start
at our prewar balance. It is to be hoped
that in making up the debit, we will heard

,with miser grip the gains of the war years.

The Fall of the Greeks - -

We note with pride-that the.current
trend in American colleges seems to be
toward a point of view that Grinnellians
have held for some time. At Cornell col-
lege recently, students voluntarily expressed
their disapproval of their local sorority
system by abolishing one group and re
fusing bids to another.

Here at Grinnell we have not suffered
from a lack of social activity, although we
have no groups which might be termed
sororities. Our cottages, democratic organv
izations, limited in enrollment only by a
most lenient class quota, serve the pur-
poses which sororities have assumed at
other schools. But we have so far escaped
the abuses which other colleges have suf-
fered. It is one of Grinnell’s proudest
boasts that no student is eliminated from
extra-curricular activities or from campus
famelbecause of social position or wealth.

We know, from experience, that soror-
ities are superfluous. We know that any
college can do without them as we have.
Our sincere congratulations to the stud
ents of Cornell college for their courage
in breaking away from an outmoded and
childish tradition, and our best wishes for
a happier campus.
