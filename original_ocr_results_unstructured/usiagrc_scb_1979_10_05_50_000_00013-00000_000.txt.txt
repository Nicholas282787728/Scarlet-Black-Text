Moses watching “Love Boat" in the
livingroom, Joan of Arc and St,
George playing Parchesi in the den,
and in the kitchen, an unidentified
man (wearing a bowling shirt with the
name “Hank” monogrammed over the

theologians are, at best, confused by
the scene.

Tony Spninoni: Even though he was
never mentioned in the Bible, Tony
Spumoni played a dramatic role in the
history of the Catholic faith as we
know it today, Tony was a bus boy at
the Last Supper.

It seems that St. Paul forgot to Call
tor a reservation, and so the party had
to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a table
(biblical records are unclear about the
time of the delay), When they were
finally seated, the maitre d’ informed
them that all that was left from the
menu was 2 fish and 5 loaves of bread.

St. Peter said he was going to go

Despite Grinnell’s “liberal” reputar
tion, I have seen Grinnellians react to
the name “Women’s Group” by con
juring up images ranging from elderly
women exchanging recipes and quilt
patterns, to a group of livid radicals
out to castrate the male race. Grins
nell‘s Women's Group is neither of
these. We are a group of women who
have joined together to further the
goal of e uality.

A one ion l have heard more than
once is: “But why is a Women‘s Group
necessary at a place like Grinnell?”

Admittedly, discrimination may be
less obvious at Grinnell, but it is
nevertheless present. For instance.
while walking through a dorm lounge
last week, I overheard a conversation
in which several male students were
assessing the “new crop of female
virgins” on the floor.

We need only to look at our own,
faculty and administrative hiera hy,
predominantly male, to realize that
Grinnell is no utopia,

In addition, many needs which are
of specific interest to women are
presently not being met. For example,
despite the large number of women re-
quiring health care services, the imr
mediate choices for health care are
less than attractive.

We are not striving only for our own
equality. To repeat a much used
phrase, “There cannot be equality for
one until there is equality for all.”

. We are different from the local

home, as he had seen this trick the
first time. Paul said it was better the
second time around, and there was no
one there to doubt that The entire
group was about to postpone the whole
dinner in favor of a movie and a late
snack, when Tony oflered to send out
for chicken. Everyone agreed, and
while they waited, DaVinci painted
their picture, The rest is history.

Reverend Billy Truliart: Truhart
was a charismatic, evangelical
preacher, who appeared on a weekly
ten-hour television sermon in the early
19205 He had a small Cult following
primarily composed of his immediate
family, as they didn't have the heart
to tell him that television hadn't been
invented yet.

Reverend Billy, as he was known to
his wife, was also ahead of his time in
his theology, He believed that not only
should women be allowed into the
clergy, but small furry rodents as
well.

Another of his beliefs that was said
to have received Critical acclaim from
a cousin of his, was that anyone over
six feet tail was automatically a '
priest,

His career ended when, during an ‘
out or body experience, his soul was
discovered with that of a beautiful , '
Norwegian model named Una, in a
hotel in the Catskills. His wife ohtaii‘l-
ed a divorce and, his audience gone,
Billy took up dentistry. He made very
few important contributions to the'
religious community from that point-
on.

There you have it; a more in-
teresting and iniluential group is hard
to rind, So, if you go to see the pope on
October 4, say hello, and even give
him a ”hihowdoyado” for me. But
remember, there may be even more
important religious figures standing
beside you in that crowd, so look
around. You never know what some'
people are up to. Ask your dentist.

Understanding the women’s group

N.O,W. (National Organization for
Women) chapter in some of our
specific goals as college studen , but
we hope to share with them in'some of
our more general goals.

The Grinnell Women’s Group has
begun its year by addressing some of
these issues. One or (Xe major tasks at
present is to organize a successful
Women‘s Week This week Will come
bine those issues of importance and
share them with the rest of the com~
munity. Often, discrimination and pre-
judice are the result of a lack of
knowledge and understanding; by
presenting films, workshops, and
speakers. we hope to integrate various
issues of concern to us all.

We are also directing our attention
toward women‘s health care issues.
Considering the high costs, and low
specialization, of many local doctors
in the field, our goal is to try to bring
a women‘s health care specialist to
the college community on a regular
basis, We are presently trying to ar-
range this type of service with the .
Emma Goldman Clinic (in Iowa City),
which provides a range of choices in
birth control and expertise in women’s
health care.

Another need we have recognized is
that of communicating our emotions.
Participating in this area, some
members will take part in
consciousnessrraising groups. These
smaller groups will be a place where
women can share many of their come

mon experiences, obtaining feedback,
strength, and support from each other,

We are realizing the value of
transferring personal feelings to
political actions. One of our future
goals is to organize action on major
issues of concern to women. We hope
to educate voters about the state
Equal Rights Amendment, so that it
will be approved when it comes to the
people's vote in November, 1980.

We will also be organizing a pro»
choice lobby to protect reproductive
righs of women. and support senators
and representatives who are being 1 ,
targeted for defeat by anti-choice , ‘ '
groups. _

Through this group experience, We
hope to deepenand synthesize our '
common feelings, and direct them
toward an active commitment to
equality and the betterment of life for g
women. :

(The Women’s Group meets Thurs~r
day evenings at 7:30 in the student Ac-
tivities Room, downstairs in the
Forum, Come and join us.) I,
