Council Approves Audit Plan

READY FOR BULLDOG CAGERS

Circuit Votes .
to Use Fewer ;

Grid Officials

Football Wedge Abolished;
Indoor Track Meet
Cancelled

The Missouri Valley conference will
curtail expenses next year by adopt-
ing a system of timing and scoring,
which will necessitate the use of three‘
officials instead of four on the grid-
iron. This move was agreed upon at
the annual meeting of conference fac-
ulty representatives and athletic di-
rectors in St, Louis Saturday.

The annual indoor track meet was,
abandoned, dates for other confer-
ence meets were set, and the repre-
sentatives adopted a measure which
prohibits the use of the wedge forma.
tion in returning kickoffs.

Men on Sidelines

Under the new arrangement for
officials, one man from each compet-
ing institution will he on the side-
lines during football games joint-
ly keep time, and another record will
be kept of substitutions at the scor-
eTS' bench along the field of play.

This plan was fostered by John C.
Truesdale, director of athletics at
Grlhnell, who experimented with the‘
idea in games of the 1930 schedule.

Duties Change

Conference representatives also de-
cided to make it possible for the
referee and umpire to exchange duties
with the possession of the ball in an
effort to eliminate delays. Heretofore.
when possession of the ball changed,
the two officials had to change pos'
tions while retaining the same duties.

The outdoor conference track meeti
will be held at Creighton university
in Omaha, May 20 and 21. and the
swimming meet is scheduled at Wash-
ington university in St. Louis, March!
11 and 12. Drake, Creighton, and
Grinnell have definitely decided not
to have baseball teams in the spring.

Eastern Trip Possibility

Butler, Tulsa university, and Okla-
homa City university were discussed
as possible additions to the confer-
ence.

E. D. Strong. professor of econom»
ics. and John C. Truesdale represented
Grinnell at the meeting.

The Grinnell football schedule for
1932, as announced there. includes six
games. This slate is subject to ap-
proval of the faculty. The Pioneers
are trying to schedule two more
games with eastern schools to form
an eastern trip, the eleven playing
games on Nov. 19 and on Thanksgiv-
ing Day.

The schedule as announced follows:
Sept. 2470mm.

Contamination
of City' Water
False Rumor

H. S. Conard. chairman of the fac—
ulty committee on public health, to-
day branded a rumor concerning con-
tamination of the city water supply
as false.

"At no time this auturrm has there
been any evidence of sewage con-
tamination," said Mr. Conard. “There
is no way by which such contamina-
tion could occur.

“All connections between the so-
called soft water system and the
city water system have been removed,
both in the city and college."

Washing the hands is one way to
get rid of difficulties. To Helen Up-
son, Srinnell college sophomore,
washing clothes is a more satisfac—
tory, if not lucrative, method of over-
coming obstacles.

Miss Upson, who hails from West
Cheshire, Conn, is a transfer from
Syracuse university, and came to
Crinncll because "I was told the col~
lege encouraged students to work
their way through school, and that
was what 1 am primarily interested
in. So farlhcve found the attitude of
both professors and students very
helpful.”

For three years Miss Upson has
been entirely “on her own.” At in-
tervals during the period she has
been a reporter, waitress, interior
decorator, lecturer, hostess, and as-
sistant advertising manager of her

job, with the assistance of a little
Polish boy I cut 1,500 bushels of po-

Miss Upson gave up her interior

Although her opportunities for work

still optimistic.

Since arriving here in September,
MISS Upson has worked in a private

Five seasoned veterans will take
the floor against a quintet of inex-
perienced sophomores Friday night
when the Crinnell college basketball
team opens the season against the
Drake Bulldogs in the Drake field-
house.

Strangely enough, neither team is
rated as a favorite at present, since
they appear evenly matched. The
greenness of the Drake team will be
offset by sheer ability, as their line<
up comprises several former all»state
high school men.

To Use Many Men

According to Coach John C. TrueS<
dale, his probable starting lineup will
be Captain McCreary and Ullrich,
guards; Edman, center; Duncan and
Rowe, forwards. It is a certainty,
though. that he will use a large num-
ber of men regardless of the outcome
of the game. Grinnell’s two sopoho-
more forwards, Frye and Waite, will
probably be in the lineup a share of
the time, since all they lack is ex—
perience under fire.

Coach Truesdale plans to take his
entire squad to Des Moines, and it is
probable that Christoffersen, Wolfe,
Schmaedecke, Manna, and others will
get a chance to show their wares. The
game does not count in conference
standings.

One Veteran

Coach Bill Boelter‘s 1931442 cage
combination will include mostly sec—
ond year men. although he may start
one veteran, Everett Schultz. six-foot-
four-inch center. Four veterans
Brewer, Goodwin, Kokjohn, and Bow-
ers are traveling with the football
team, and will strengthen the squad
upon their return.

With Lynn King, John Monahan,
Chris iverson. Frank Brody, Chet
Buzard, and Keith Pound missing
from this year’s squad. Boelter must
place his faith in the promising crop
of freshmen of last year.

All—State Forwards

Two all—State men, Leo Golden of
Davenport, and Joe Wright of Car—
men. Okla., are the outstanding for—
wards, together with Don King, bro—
ther of the versatile Lynn King. Don
played enough the second semester of
last year to earn his letter, but is
