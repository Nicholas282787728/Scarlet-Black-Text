Past Homecomings

BY SYLVIA JOSEPH.

A homecoming back in 19:2 was
not what it is today. A short notice
in the SCARLET AND BLAC ’ for
that year stated casually that “part
of the grands‘,ttud would be reserved
for rcturniug .numni at the Col ell—
Crinnell game and that old gladu-
ates would celebrate the evening a:
ter the game with s ollilicttion' in
the Associations building.

The nature of the "jolliiantiun"
must forever remain a mystery. The
only statement in the nex. is c
which could pos y refer to toe
tivities of aluv‘ ni “'5 the mourniul-
ly saioas..r strt .t, "The Council

Big Celebration in 1923.

in the fall of 1918 there was no
homecoming Instead there was a
flu epidemic Since women of the
college could not even venture into
the congestion of the dovmtown area,
lest they meet with deadly germs,
the college did not want guestsina-
turally. And besides, all available
football material was in the Reserves
or ”over there.”'

coco

The year 1923,‘ however, can boast
of a real homecoming celebration.
Old graduates from all parts of the
country atended. The entertainment
included a play, a luncheon, a dinner,
and a dance. The dinner, which was
in the quadrangle, dining room, was

given in honor of the original Pio-
eer football team of 1889. Among
the oldest alumnae present was Mar-
the Cleveland Dibble, '67, for whom
Martha Cleveland cottage and Dibble
nall were named.

At chapel Seniors wore white:
Junior women appeared carrying
open umbrellas, while Junior men
rolled their trousers up to their
knees and wore rubbers or galoshes
ifol' decorative purposes only; Sope
homores wore yellow slickers; and
the lowly Freshmen displayed coats
worn wrong side out and the red
prep caps which are still a Grinnell
tradition.

Drake Team Plays
Washington Today

Des Moines, Oct. 12.7Spurred on
by what they believe to be an even
chance of winning the Missouri Val-
ley conference football championship
for the second successive season,
Drake football players centered their
attention this week ,1 on Washington
university, which will be met by the
Bulldogs today.

The game, like the two which have
preceded it on the Drake schedule,
will be a night contest and will be
played on Francis held in St. Louis.

The utmost respect for the Wash
ington university squad is shown in
the Drake camp, where the Bears
are regarded as one of the toughest
of the valley teams to be met by the
Bulldogs this season. ossie Solem,
the Drake coach, rates Dr. Al Sharpe,
the Washington mentor. as one of
the smartest coaches in the game,
while in Jablonsky and other regulars
at Washington, the Bears have indi—
vidual players the equal of any in
this section, according to Coach
Solern.

Co-Education Unpopular in East;
Poor Students Fewer, Says Wood

13v MARGARET MATLACK.

students at Trinity college who are
not able to givc a ready answer to
the professor's question may be non-
chalant, as the ad writers would say,
and light a cigarette, according to
Professor Paul Spencer Wood, chair-
man of the English department, who
has returned to Srinnell after a two
years leave of absence, during which
he occupied a similar position at Trin-
ity college, Hartford, Conn.

Smoking in classes (Trinity is a
men's college) makes for a pleasant-
ly informal atmosphere, Professor
Wood stated.

Athletic Teams Similar.

The athletic situation at Trinity
college is much the same as that at
Grinncll. The athletic teams of
Trinity compete with teams of his
stitutions somewhap larger than‘it-
self, Professor Wood pointed out.
Connecticut Wesleyan college and
Connecticut Agricultural college are
Trinity’s closest and most formidable
rivals, just as Drake and Iowa State
are Grinnell‘s. The teams at Trin-
ity, too, have streaks of good luck
and of bad luck; last year when the
football team lost every game but
one, a 0—0 tie, not‘scoring a touch»

’down all season, the basketball team

beat both its strongest rivals.

Differences between the two col—
leges, according to Mr. Wood, include
the fact that Trinity is a small col-
lege, situated in a large /clty Thus
it is easier than at Grinnell for stu-
dents to earn their expenses. Chapel
is held six mornings a week, stu-
dents residing in the dormitories or
fraternity houses being required to
attend four mornings each week,
while those living at home are re-
quiredlo attend but once.

 

, At Trinity Saturday is a regular
class day and is so regarded by the
students. Chapel is held; as on our
er mornings at 3 5 The abhorre‘d

Frances Co'ats will visit her sister,
who is teaching in Marshalltown,
Saturday and Sunday.

 

 

eight o‘clocks of our campus are un-
known in the Eastern college, as
classes do not begin until nine 0'»
clock.

(Jo-Education Unpopular.

Proceeding form speciﬁc super-
ficial differences between Trinity col-
lege and Crinnell, \Professor Wood
explained the general differences be-
tween education in the middlewest
and in the East. Co—educntion is not
popular east of the Ohio volley, all
the outstanding institutions being
for men or women alone. ,

"One effect of this segaregation,"
Professor Wand Stated, "is to lie
away with the artiﬁcial division or
subjects into masculine, or feminine
specialties. A lively interest in sci—
ence, economics, and mathematics is
shown in the women’s colleges, In,
the men’s colleges there is a similar
interest in languages, art and his»
tory. Doing away with the artiﬁcial
distribution makes for a more
healthful student attitude."

Best In West,

The general average of students
in eastern institutions is much the
same as in Lhe west, but in the small
eastern colleges the poor students
are not so poor as the poorest in the
West. and, conversely, the good stu-
dents are not so good as the best in
the West. Professor Wood account»
ed for this difference by the fact
that the large institutions such 'as
Yale, Harvard, Vassar. and Wellesiey
attract the superior students, while
the poor ones are weeded out in the
preparatory school. As a result a
rather more homogeneous group is
left.

In conclusion, Professor Wood
stated that college spirit as we know-
it in Grinnell is not so evident at
Trinity college. _As a consequence
the solidarity of feeling which is pre-
valent here is less evident.
