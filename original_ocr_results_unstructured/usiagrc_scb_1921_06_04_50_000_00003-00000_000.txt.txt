SUPPOSE that a stove burns too much coal for .the amount of

experiments which will indicate desirable changes in design. The stove
sclectcd as the most efﬁcient is the result of research. ' 1

Suppose that you want to make a ruby in a factory—not a more

imitation, but a real ruby, indistinguishable by any chemical or
physical test from the natural stone. You begin by analyzing rubies
chemically and physically. Then you try to make rubies just as
nature did, with the same chemicals and under similar conditions.
Your rubies are the result of research—research of a different type
from that required to improve the stove.

Suppose. as you melted up your chernicals to produce rubies and
- experimented with high temperatures,.you began to wonder how hot
the earth must have been millions of years ago when rubies were ﬁrst
crystallized, and what were the forces at play that made this filsner
what it is. You begin an investigation that leads you far from rubies
and causes you to formulate theories to explain how the earth, and,
for ihat matter,.llow the whole solar system was created. That would
be research of a still different typehpioneering into the unknown to
satisfy an insatiable curiosity.

Research of all three types is conducted in the Laboratories of the
General Electric Company. But it is the third type of research—
ploneering into the unknown—that means most, in the long run, even
though it is undertaken with no practical beneﬁt in View.

At the present time, for example, the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company are exploring matter with X-rays in order
to discover not only how the atoms in different substances are
arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more you
know about a substance, the more you can do with it. Some day this
X-ray work will enable scientists to answer more deﬁnitely than they
can now the question: Why is iron magnetic? And then the elec»
trical industry will take a great step forward, and more real progress
will be made in ﬁve years than can be made in a century of experi»
menting with existing electrical apparatus.
