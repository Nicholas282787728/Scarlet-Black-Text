The Grinnell thinclads came up
with several good individual per»
formances, but still finished well
back in the Grinnell Invitational
Saturday. Elghteen teams showed
up tor the meet, which is probably
the best small»college track meet
in Iowa, with the exception of the
Drake Relays.

Northeast Missouri State over-
whelmed the opposition provided
mainly by Luther, Wisconsin River
Falls, and C09, to win the meet
by a large margin. Some of the
better performances included a 9,6
second 100 yard dash; 6’5” high
jump, and 50’ triple yump during
the afternoon.

Admissions man Steve Carroll has
denied junior Toni Kalhorn the ch.
ance for a double intramural crown
by whipping him in the paddleball
finals. Carroll, who outscored an
earlier opponent 42-4 over two ga-
mes, led all the way. Aided by a
strong service, he scored victories
of erii and 2177 to win the ch-
ampionship. Carroll, dissatisfied
with the lack of good players on
campus, and currently involved in
recruiting some real paddleballers
tor next year, commented to this
reporter that his toughest match was
against Jerry Lalonde. Lalonde won
the earlier squash l.M. competition.

As tor Kalhorn, he has yet to play
Tim Havens in the deciding match
of the handball competition.

PING PONG

l.M. ping pong continues, with com-
petition entering the fourth stage
this weekend. Eight hopeluls were

triple yump and 5th in the long
jump, recording seasonal bests. Dan
Hildebrand also ran his best 3,
mile of the outdoor season with a
15:12 for 7th place in the Simile.

The Coe invitational tommorrow
at Cedar Rapids should be a little
easier for Grinnell. At this point
in the season Mr. Ohermiller is
fairly optimistic about the Confer-
ence meet coming up in May.

There will be a PCITC meet Fri»
day at 5:15 on the outdoor track,
weather permitting. Anyone inter-
ested is invited to come and run

Pioneer 9 Split, Grub lst I

by Marty Iker

it is iast becoming apparent to
teams around the league that the
old Midwest Conlerence proverb
stating: "Everyone beats Grinnell
in baseball!” does not apply any
more, The strong, young pioneers
play as it they had never heard
anything about it.

True, they’re not exactly tearing
up the league, but they're playing
the best baseball seen at Grinnell
in many years and have a contere
ence record at 2 wins and 2 losses,
one of each against C09 and Corn-
ell. Mike Levy has taken credit
{or both victories and has been
backed up quite eilectively by the
defense,

After a teneday layeoii due to
poor weather, the Pioneers took the
field once again Wednesday against
Cornell at Fowler Field and came
away with their second split in
league competition this year, Wll'tr
ning the first contest 574 behind
Levy and the hitting of Bill John
son, Craig Zippe and John Haigh.
The second game went to Cornell
10-1, when Grinnell’s pitching tell
apart.

The pioneers started dealing ear-
ly, breaking through tor live runs
in the second inning. Catcher Jack
Hamann led it off with a single,
Jeff Dick also singled, and the two
were scored when Bill Johnson lite
ted a shot over the left-field fence
tor a threeerun homer. The last
two runs were driven in by John
Haigh and Craig Zippe,

The score stood at 5—0 until the
sixth, when Cornell spurted tor
four runs on a iielder‘s choice,

BADMINTON

The only badminton tourney of the

Grinnell's pitching woes became
apparent in the second game. Al»
though there was a detensive lapse
in the game, seven of the ten Cor—
nell runs were earned. Craig Zippe
yielded seven runs in the three
innings he pitched. Reliefer Jail

the next tllree innings, but Cornell
upped their total to nine runs. Wes

Pioneers Ripped
In Net Opener

by Andy Bloom

Grinnell’s netmen suffered their
first loss of the new season in the
tennis match against Ripon last
Friday. Facing a strong Ripunteam,
the Pioneers could fare no better
than a sea decision, winning only
two singles and 3 doubles match.

Brad Vazalas lost his singles mar
tch to a tough Ripon opponent who
had been eager to topple Grinnell's
Midwest Conference champion. Neal
Trablch, Andy Bloom, and fresh-
man Lee Lasky also lost close
matches to strong opponents. Only
Dave Eeeman and Peter, Docring
were able to salvage victories in
their singles matches.

Entering the doubles phase of the
match, with Grinnell down 4-2, Pe-
ter Doering again came up with a
spectacular win, this time teamed
with Lee Lasky. However,theteams
of Vazalas-Trabl'ch and Beeman-
Bloom could not eke out victories
in their respective positionsallow»
lng Ripon to win the dual meet.
The Pioneers will come back and
release their irustrations against
Knox and Monmouth Colleges at
Galesliurg tomorrow, Victories over
these Schools would raise Grinnell’s
record to 2-1.
