Stamps

Adopted By Sludeni' Governmenl‘ ’¥

“Cooperation not competition" is
the plan for student-administra-
tion relations adopted last night in
a meeting of 50 representatives of
Grinnell student government or-
ganizations with Pres. Samuel N.
stevcns last night.

Meeting as an informal dis-
cussion group Without any spe-
cific authority, the representatives
recommended action:

1. To make the selection of nail
residents the duty of a joint
board of D, of n. P, and pep
souncl committee members, with
the further power for C, of H
r. lenders to submit any grounds
for rejection of a man to ad-
ministrative authorities for final
action

2, To establish a “red tape"
committee of the student council
for a specific study of unneces-
sary details in administrative ac-
tinn regnrung student functions

3. To clarify the scope of the
Grinncll car rule, to publicize
that its enforcement is strictly
a matter for administrative act,
ion, and to recommend that pun-
isllmcnt for the first offense be
mnde less stringent and that
names of first offenders be held
in confidence until second of-
fenses, as is now done by C. of
H, 1-. members in enforcing the
drinking rule in the dormitory
system.

With the main point of con—
flict between student government
and administrative authority a-
rising ovcr powers of discipline,
Kent Hampton, temporary chair~
man, opened the session with a
rcquest for strict definition

On the basis of a statement by

Mother’s Day
May 10th

Dr. Stevens, giving the adminis-
tration’s idea of the powers of
students ofﬁcials, the represcnr
tativcs filled in the powers they
thought s t u d e n t government
should have which the president’s

. . . . Picture Plaques,
definition did not include.
