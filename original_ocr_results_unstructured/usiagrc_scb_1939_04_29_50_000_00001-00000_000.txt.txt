Quiet Reigns in

Cyclone Office
At Long Last

‘On thc second floor of the White
House the clattering typewriter
is silent; dust settles gently on
the worn rubber roller. Paper
which might have passed as a
reasonably exact facsimile of a
tickcretape snowstorm lies quietly
‘ln the bright rad Wastebdskets.

A grim collection of empty coke
bottles turns hleary, glass eyes
on the empty desks, the discarded
photographs and the marked col-
endar. The rug, freed from the
flotsam and jetsam or copy—paper
and picture ends, presents once
more a smooth, green surface. For
the last time, the nervous keys
have tapped out deadlines and as-
signments; thc cutter's keen
blade, having Survived the editor’s
last fit of temper, has for the last
time put someone out of the pic—
Lure and Created another face on
the cuttingroom floor.

The last flash-bulbs have flash-
ed, the last proofs have been
posted. And the Staff members
who, at this stage of the game,
have been reduced to a. paper
pulp, just sit very quietly and
smell the printer's ink. They are
very happy. The CYCLONE has
gone to press,

ment of the powers and methods

initely determines the area. of reg-
ulatory responsibility of the men‘s
government in an effoit to best
fulfill the needs of the men’s in»
terests in the dormitories and
town houses.

clear the purpose, membership,
election of the Council of House
Presidents' officers, their duties,
date of installation, the responsi-
hilities and powers of the presi-
dents‘ group, and methods of
amending the constitution. Sec~
tion two outlines the elections and

cers and gives their eligibility
