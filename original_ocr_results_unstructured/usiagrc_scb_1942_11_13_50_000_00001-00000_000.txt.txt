 

OPEN lETTER

TO THE STUDENTS OF GRINNELL

if you are one of the people who think all this talk about
riv on war effort is wasted energy you’ll skip this and start
reading Doric; but it's you we mean when we say this campus
needs a tailiingaiown about as subtle as an avalanche.

There's a war on or did you know? There are 300 Crin-
nellians in active service in that warilook at tiie service flag
sometime. There are 500 students here right now. Stack up the
contnbutlons of the two groups in the most serious national
emergency in history and the score won't look so good for the
home team.

Yeah, we know. You've heard this before. You've done your
part, You ate rice with the rest of us for Grinnell-lnrchina last
year, you saved your toothpaste tubes for a while, and now
someone's beginning to talk about another War Chest drive and
you guess you’ll kick in with the rest—when and if your house
chairman corners you with a blunt instrument.

Now listen to a few facts. Since the war started, and even
before, there have been four or five groups on this campus try-
ing to make a contribution to the national defense and war
effort. i

At the most that means 25 or 30 people who have actually
torn out a few hairs, skipped a few sessions in the smoker. or
sacrificed a Saturday afternoon collecting waste paper. The rest
of us? We've listened to announcements in the dining room and
then forgotten the meetings,

Twenty-ﬁve or so students. That's only a little more than
five per cent of our college enrollment So what? So suppose the
rest of 130,000,000 Americans felt like that? How’d you like
just a little over five per cent of a victory? .

You think what we're doing here doesn't count? Listen.
You haven't seen anything in ration books yet, The response
to the recent scrap drive alleviated the metal shortage for now7
but not because anybody sat home and thought about finding
scrap. Some people went out and found it! if you don’t want
life to become just one long series of ration books, of diswun
aging headlines, of casualty lists of people you know, you'll
stop being a guilty bystander.

Some of you fellows are going into the armed services
yourself soon. Sure, you haven't got much time left and you
have a lot of things you want to do besides think about the war.
Al serious attitude toward the subjects you're taking to prepare
you for that war is your contribution if nothing else. .

But you, too, and every one of us, has got to get over the
idea of letting the other 25 or 30 people do all these things. And
the time is right now. What can you do? Let's start with
something easy.

1. Listen to announcements in house meeting, just for the
novelty of it.

2. You can get into some of these campus war activities and
mean it. Currently, you can sew a star on the service flag.
Sure, its pure symbolism; we happen to be fighting for
a lot of things just as intangible but mighty precious. You
can pledge a kit bag, get rid of those old lipstick tubes,
You might even buy a war stamp.

. You can get serious about this war. We don't mean grim,
because this is a time for spirit. Let’s be neither morbid nor
superficial. Face the fact that lots of Grinnellians will be
leaving us soon; then don't sit around dwelling on it. But
start doing something to make sure they'll come back soon.
When Bataan fell, a cartoon appeared in this nation's

newspapers showing two figures who were soon to become sym—
bolic of much of the American attitude toward this war. They
were: Too Little and Too Late. We suggest Grinnellians got on
the ball, before Too Little and Too Late become campus pen
sonalities.

William McKeon, student
council president, proposed
last night in a meeting of that
body, that all smoking in the
quadrangle dining room be
stopped until and unless all

ash-trays are returned.
The measure would apply to
both men and women.

Ashtrays were provided for
every table at the beginning of
the year. Within a week, seven
had disappeared. and the rate has
not slowed down.

No official action can be taken
by the council, but the proposal
wiu be presented to Miss Nellie

iars would be assessed to halls
and cottages, he said, but no ac»
tion was taken.
