A Common Disease

Dissatisfaction is making itself heard throughout the
college. On south campus violent reaction has resulted in an
“anti»monitor" campaign and the election movement for
“Liberalism plus Politics equals Everything—Weewant.” Lea-
gue Board election campaigners used such phrases _as
“stereotype hall chairmen,” “tradition,” ”showing desire
for office." The present board is accused of being conserva-
tive, controlled by administrative officers, and averse to
improvement.

It seems a dissatisfied element is convincing the stu-
dent body that anything which smacks of the past (includ—
ing women‘s government) is of necessity bad. This element
wants Grinnell to be a smallsize, small-town school with a
large-size, city atmosphere. it is out of style to like the
college.

Certainly, some of the complaints are justified. Wo-
men’s electioneering seems a direct reaction against not
having a get-acquainted: system. Had the monitor system
been discussed before enforced, it would have met with
cooperation, rather than childislmess. The dissatisfied ele-
ment may be a result of extensive student body reorienta-
tion. Under its influence League Board is, for the first time,
held responsible to the women. Previously, students have
accepted that elected officers are doing the best possible
When the former monitor system was discontinued, the
board handled the action, and students accepted it.

Criticism has initiated several improvements on south
campus: 10:30 hours, monitor system, discussion groups.
Hall representatives are satisfied with the rulings as they
stand. A radical censorship of motives of the electioneering
women indicates students are not convinced that all tra-
dition is bad. However, the complaints have not abated.

_ Constructive criticism and chronic dissatisfaction are
opposites. In search of the former, students have become
infested with the latter, We feel that the majority of stu—
dents is basically satisfied with the college It is time this
majority makes itself heard.

To ,Creater Responsibility

The tentative system regarding class absences, as pre-
sented by Dean Homer Norton at Student Council meeting
last night, is a long anticipated wish by many students.
The first alternative proposal allows unlimited cuts except
for days before and after vacations, and the first and last
days of each semester. The Student Council has endorsed
this plan and has recommended its adoption.

Dislike for a rigid cut system is based upon student
ideas of college, and its place in forming mature individuals
stringent rules are frowned upon as blocking a mature ap-
proach to college training Current interest has been ex-
pressed about both the cut system and an honor system,
showing that many students feel ready to assume more re~
sponsibility.

Many do not take advantage of their full absence allot—
ment under the present system. But all are aware of the
rule and check on absences. The present system is not
unduly severe, but is strict enough to make liberalization
a worthwhile and welcome thing, for eliminating an aware-
ness of cuts can lead to creating an awareness of personal
responsibility.

Some have stated that under an unlimited cut system,
students are likely to miss classes in excess. If the class is
challenging excessive absences are unlikely. Under the pres-
ent system, there are many classes in which absences are
damaging, not because of stringent professorial disapproval,
but because of material presented and active discussion
not covered in class notes. Perhaps an unlimited out system
would stimulate more of these classes.

This proposed liberal system emphasizes greater stu-
dent responsibility. It states, “The policy of Grinnell col—
lege is to impose as few miles as possible. Our students
are considered responsible adults, and are treated in that
manner . l . So at Grinnell we have a set of rules designed
to help us accomplish our educational objectives and to
achieve satisfying community life.”

A first glance, these sentences sound as though they
are written in typical catalog style. However, if the system
gains approval, it will stand as proof of these ideals.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Ofelia”

During the recent Student
Council elections the chielf catch
phrase was “unified student
government.” All the canddddtcs
came out in favor of it, (“Adm
all,” said one in private, “every-
one else is for it, so why come
out against it?" This may be
good politics, but it is ‘not an
intelligent way to approach the
problem).

Actually, no one has been
able to slimy a real need for
unified student government, to
say nothing or showing they
could solve the problems that
are involved in unifying the
campuses. Before we rush
headlong into “unified stu-

dent government" let us pause '

and consider the
more thoroughly.

I believe that there should be
some improvement in the rela-
tionship between the cmpuses.
but I do not favor the unified
iegdsLature now being proposed,
for the following reasons:

Situation

1. Separate government for
men and women is not inher-

ently wrong. it exists and
works quite well on many
campuses.

2 North and south campuses
have very different systems of
government. The men live to;
gether in the same hall for four
years and elecl their hall gov-
ernlments from among themsel-
ves; the women move mm hall
to hall and elect their hall presi-
dents from lhe woman hit hangs.
To uhile these two campuses
under a centralized: legislauive
body is impossible without sac-
riflcing some of the traditions
of both campuses.

3 Nu satisfactory reason has
yet been given for why men
should. help determine the
rules for south campus and
why women shnuld help deter-
mine the rules for north cam—
pusl

4 ’Dwo alternatives have heen
proposed to a fully centralized
legislature. The League Board
and c of HP may continue to
legislate for their respective
campuses, in which case the
central legislature will do no
more than the Student Council
now does. Or, each body lean be
allowed to chrome a common set
of rules in their own way, in
which case we will not only
have the same problems cl dif-
ferinlg interpretation what we
now have. (Instead of solving
our own prolblems, we will have
compounded them).

Aclunlly, what we need is
not a ccnlrahzed legislature,
for which wc have no real
need, but a supreme judiciary.
