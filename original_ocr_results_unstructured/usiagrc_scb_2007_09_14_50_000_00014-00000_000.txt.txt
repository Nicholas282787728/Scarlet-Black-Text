At this weekend’s Duke, the team trumps the individual

While nearly every athletic team sharcs a
special bond, Allison Louthiin ’08 reveals that
the women’s cross country team might be a
little lighter than others. “We’re naketi ii lot
together," Lonthan said.

Streaking or clothed, Allison and fellow sc~
nior Sarah Spencer '03 have distanced them-
selves from the rest of the team as Griuucll’s,
and possibly the Midwest center-cuces two
fastest runners,

The pair": performance at last Saturday’s
Les Duke Invitational, where Spencer and
Louthan finished first and second by a size
able margin, shows they tlefrnrtely have the
individual talent to compete. Off the course,
though, Louthan and spencer consider them
selves just two members otthe team, insisting
that hanging outwith teammates isjust as im-
portant as any meet performance.

“From an outside perspective, people might
think that oui team could be a lot more serious
in some parts of our training," Spencer said.
“I think that’s worked out to be a strength for
us because it helps us to be running for more
than just competition and winning, but also
for the whole team and the fun that we get out
oftraining together."

“Even the women who aren't scoring for
the team and who didn’t get on a plane to go
to Ohio [for nationals] last year, they still really
support us," Lourhan said.

Despite running up ahead of the test of
the varsity, the team's training schedule allows
Spencer and Louthan to run with each other
on most days, butwith the entire team on oth-
ers.

“They"vc got a training bond for sure,"
said head coach Evelyn Freeman. "They run
all of their interval and pace workouts togethr
er. Those two are training partners and they
should be training together on the hard days
and they should be racing together."

Besides, Freeman said, “It's a lot easier to
run with another person or another group
rather than by yourself. You read to run a lot
better than way."

As for thou own relationship, Spencer and
Louthan are focusing on working togethct,

“I just want to keep up with her,” Loutr
han said. “But I’m starting to tealize thatI can
help her too."

With Spencer and Louthan leading an
already strong team, Grinnell entertains high
hopes for the season, looking for yet another
MWC title.

While the athletic department may
search far and wide tot prospective athletes,
it didn't even need to leave town to find new
intramural athletic director Tim Hammond.
Hammond, a local Grinncllian, has replaced
Nikki McClellan, who dcparted to become
the new women’s soccer head coach at Knox
college, and will juggle the usual multitude
of jobs most Grinnell coaches handle.

In addition to intramural responsibilities,
Hammond will serve as an assistant coach
tor women's swrmrning and will become
club sports director, responsible for all clubs
and sports not officially sanctioned by the
athletic department. He also brings genuine
excitement to an intramural program that
has dealt wrth complaints and scheduling
problems over the past few years.

Hammond said that a well—run system
might be Grinnell's most important need.

The Duke, With no ranked teams in the

bigger event. And this early in the year, team
relationships come first.

“It's about just continuing to be a cohe-

Even wrthorrt changing anything

changes to make this year mote of a

first-year's (and even veteran Grinnelhans)
to either join teams or create their own
through a club. This year, volleyball and
badminton clubs have joined the already
extensive lrst of casual Grinnell sports teams.

With a limited budget, though, Hammond
knows he must dcal with the high cost of
additions. Thrrs, rmprovcments will rely on an
increasing amorrnt of Grinnellians becoming
involved in lntlamnrals, Yet Hammond already
thinks that Giinncll’s turnout is impressive.
“In comparison to most intramural programs,
Grinnell's intramural program is really great
for the number of students on campus."

alerts head coach Will Freeman was up-
beat about his team’s performance. “We ran
tartly well," Freeman said, “But the most en-
couraging thing is thatwc ran dccp. We had a
zorsecond range frotn first place to frfth,"

Besides, the Pioneers aren't even at full
strength yet. Top runner Drake Ballew ’08
(who is also the SCs’B‘r Assistant Web Editor)
has been sidelined this season. Ifhealthy, a sol~
id performance from him could have vaulted
the Pioneers into first.

Freeman insists this weekend's focus was
not on a first place finish, but on encouraging
his team to run together. While fans might
naturally focus on an individual runner's result,
Freeman emphasizes camaraderie. Top runs
ncrs Reich and Montgomery were sidcrbyr
side the entire race, ﬁnishing just ﬁve seconds
apart. '

“We wanted the others right behind them,"
said Freeman. “Therpoint was not to make
this just the two ofthem."

W'omen's head coach Evelyn Ftee-
man echoed this sentiment. “We were
focusing on the same thing," she said.
“Allison and Sarah run together as the top
two, and then we've got a large group behind
them."

Even so, neither coach was wholly satisfred
with the results. “Three of our top Six could
have run better than they ran, and maybe the
whole group,"Will Freeman said.

Evelyn Freeman echoed this, saying that
“most of our people ran a little slower than
usual."

Both coaches added that the times were
slow because of rain earlier in the week, and
that on a faster course, the Pioneers’ times will
deﬁnitely improve.

A slow time can be toietated for now, as
long as runners reach their peak at the end
of October. Sure. the Pioneers‘ finishes at the
Duke look good on paper, but their perfor-
mance at this year Midwest Conference tour-
nament is all that matters.

vision of a bustling intramural program.
