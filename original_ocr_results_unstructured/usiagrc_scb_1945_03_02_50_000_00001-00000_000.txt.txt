.dark horse and ran away withl

 

on the eve of the convention
each campaign manager woefully
admits that his candidate is not
sure to be in the top two tomor-
row when Gerry Ross brings
down the gavel and opens the
fifth nomination convention.

Parallel Tn ’43 Race

Juniors and seniors are draw»
ing parallels between the pres»
ent contlict and the 1943 presi-
dential race. That was the year
when three men were running
neck and neck, and none of them
seemed certain of coming out on
top. That was the year whenI
Marilyn McCool stepped in as a

the election in spite of nearly a
hundred years of Crinnell tradi-
tion.

During the past week the num-
ber of candidates deﬁnitely in
the running has been enlarged
to five when scattered support
for Virginia Johnston appeared.
The comic element entered in as
hilarious signs appeared all over
campus, as well as a three by
ten foot placard that appeared
on Coodnow Hall. Johnston, who
is organizations editor of Cyclone,
secretary of the Board of Relig-
ion, in w. A. A... and on the bud-
dies committee, may be the “dark
horse” everyone is anticipating.

Not to be outdone by the John-
ston placard, the Jessie Ternbcrg
supporters displayed a huge ban—
ner which hung from third floor
to first floor of Blair Hall. Pen-
nants floated from‘ lamp posts
and Ternberg signs stretched the
entire length of the loggia, as
her supporters pushed her furth—
er into the limelight.

Preps Deciding Factor

The prep halls once again ape
pear to be the deciding factor in
this election. Although Cleve-
land support shifts almost daily,
it seems to be predominantly
Ternberg, and the rest of the del-
egation for Johnston and unde-
cided. Main seems about half
Montague and half Warren, and
Mears is mostly Caskey with a
few Warren votes scattered
throughout. The uppcrclass cot-
tages remain quite unpredictable,
and Pine Tree seems mostly Mon-
tague. -

Last Monday night at house»
meetings, the delegates to repre-
sent the various cottages and
halls were chosen. Most obseer
ers believed there was no marks
ed difference in the way the halls
stood, No solid block of votes,
it seems, will be thrown in any
candidate's direction, and from
all indications the fight at the
convention Saturday will be even
hotter than expected.

Campus Machines

The “Warren for President"
political machine clicked off unr
usually clever signs, portrait
posters, and blanket advertiser
ments as the tally score was be.
ing figured up and election re-
sults predicted. Examples of
their campaign are the bunny
rabbit signs that appeared on
campus, and the rabbit favors
with the letter “W" that appears
ed by each place at dinncr Wed—

Blends East
And West In
Unique Style

The only Chinese woman
monologist, Soo Yong, will
appear in Herrick chapel to—
morrow night at eight o’clock

new mollodrama of Chinese
life under the auspices of the
concert and lecture series.

In the past few years Sou
Yong has delighted audiences all
over the country with her orig-
inal programs Her characters,
whether young girl student or
ancient great-grandmother, are
skillfully portrayed through her
versatility and are magnificently
and authentically costumed. Her
performances have been received
with the greatest enthusiasm, and
have been especially praised as
being not only highly entertain-
ing but instructive as well.

Blending of East and West

Miss 500 Yong, called a “beau-
tiful blending of East and West"

America. A true ccsmopolite, she
was born on the Island of Maui
of Chinese parentage. graduated
from the university of Hawaii.
and completed her education in
New York, where she received
her master's degree from Colum-

Miss 500 Yong

With Katherine Cornell in
“The Letter" Miss Yong made
her Broadway debut, after which
she endeared herself to American
audiences as the distinguished
Mistress of Ceremonies for Mei
tan-fang, China's greatest ac-
tor. in his tour of the country.

Then Hollywood beckoned, and
Miss Yong played in many majr
or productions, among which was
the lead in MGM's “Rainbow
Pass" In "The Good Earth" she
had the distinction of being the
only member of the cast to play
two parts.

Princess Der Ling says of this
Chinese actress:

“Soo Yong's monologues arc
the most delightful I have ever
heard she is indeed the Chinese
Cornclia otis Skinner."
