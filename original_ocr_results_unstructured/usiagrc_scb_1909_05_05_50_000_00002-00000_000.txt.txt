“The spring picnic season is here

campus news from a fail- tryouter?
The prevailing sentiment in the editor-
ial sanptum this morning is that the

The Seat Sale Nuisance.

It is with no especial reierence to
the particular organization which pel‘r

An Opportunity to Boost

On Saturday there will be between
any and one hundred or the best high
school athletes or this part or the stoic

have been allowed \\ hue in town to go
to and irom their trains, to ll'zlndel
about the campush in gcueral to amuse
themselves, as best they could. without
the attention or interest or any Col-
lege ol'gan‘ ation or man.

lt does not seem compatible with the
much touted Gl-illllell Spirit (or a pas-
sive attitude of this sort to be display-
ed before these “High Schoolors,"

It is upon the impression which these
athletes receive and, in turn, transmit.
to their school lellows, that it will de

addition, Grinnell’s continued athletic
supremacy demands that she enrol:

In other schools the Interscholastic
Meet is made much of. All interests
devote the day to making tor the Col-
