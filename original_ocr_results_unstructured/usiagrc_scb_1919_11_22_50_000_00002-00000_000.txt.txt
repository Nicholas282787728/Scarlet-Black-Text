Grinndl is a school for

were actually living while in college.
Cillege has been called a four years
. loaf. Those who so consider it make
it plain that they hold that the busi-
ness of living does not commence until
after college days.
No more dangerous attitude of mind

scul’ed the deadly seriousness of the
purpose which is the basis of it.

sir William Oslel', who holds the

chair of medicine at Oxford univtrsity
advised Yale freshmen to live in “air
tight” compartments.

Dr. Osler believes that the present
should be emphasized to the virtual
exclusion oi the past and future.

what has happened in the past can—
not he changed, what will happen in
the future depends on the present.

The college student who makes the
most of his college career now and
fulﬁlls each day's duties to the best of
his ability need fear nothing for the
future. A hank president’s or sena-
tor's shoes are waiting for him if he
cares to on them

In another part of his speech Mr.

Gmer spoke of the Grinnell gradu-
ate who. going in search of his first
Job. discovers to his disappointment
that there is no one thing for which he
is especially ﬁttedr

This raises the question as to how
far Grinnell students can expect to
specialize from the work ofiered here.
It is our opinion that it is not the
function of Grinnell tn ht a man for
the peculiar requirements of any sneer
iallzed line of work.

The man who requires this special
training and cannot afford to take
more than four years college work has
no business graduating from Grinnell.

The purpose of this college. as we
see it. is to give its students that
broad cultural experience which wlll
deepen their lives and add to their cn-
joyment of it no matter what profes-
sion or business they may take up.
