The hardest schedule in years has
been mapped out for the Pioneer bas—

_ ket men for thercohning season, most
of the games being with the top-
notch schools of the Missouri Valley
Conference. The above schedule is
not complete, as two tentative games
have been scheduled with Cornell, the

dates as yet being undecided, Other.

state schools may also appear on open
dates throughout the season.
Suum] Working Hlu'll.

Coach Carl Compton has a squad of
twenty-ﬁve men reporting for practice,
and although practically every other-
school in the state Was able to get in
two weeks of practice before the holi-
days, the'Pioneers should be in good
form for the season. With the ﬁrst
game but a few days off, the squad
is being given stiff workouts this
week. in order to make up as much
as possible for lost time.

Three varsity basketball men, Win-
tel; Evans and Wassanaar, are out
for berths on the team, as well as sev-
eral varsity substitutes and a number
of men from the freshman class team
and ,other class teams or last year.
Linn and De Ruyter of last year's ﬁve
are not in school this year, while
Crane's death left 8. big gap to be
filled on this year’s team.

Ten Conference Guides.

A feature of the schedule for this
“‘ season is the number of Missouri Vale
ley games to he played. In all ten
games are listed with teams in the
conference, and only two with nonv
conference aggregations. It is prob-
able, however, that games will be ar-
-ranged with Coe, Cornell and other
state schools. Two game series with
the Kansas Aggies and with Washing-
ton University are to be played away
from home, but a majority of the con-
tests will he caged on the home
court,

The lack of a class series as a
method of preparing the five for the
season's playing may prove to be a
handicap in some respects, but as some
of the men returnedfroro vacation a
few days early in order to practice
'this will be largely overcome. It is
Possible that a class series will be
arranged after the regular season is
ended, unless too far over into the
spring.

Carl Compton. who is coaching this
Year’s five, is a former Cr-innell star,
having played on state champion
teams a few years back. Under his
tutelage the squad is rapidly acuui ~
ing a tcamplay which should put them
in the front rank of M. v. schools this
year, While tire loss of Captain Ham~
mond, Linn and Crane wil prove a
great handicap, Pioneer supporters
feel that with the wealth of material
available Coach Compton will be able
to turn out a winning team.

Ignorance Is Cause of -
Epidemic of Siritualism

"Plain ignorance is the cause of the
world-wide epidemic of spiritualism,"
said Rev. H. L. Haywood in chapel
this morning, "Time and experience
have disproved its theories and if peo-
ple would only Stop to think they
would see how foolish all these beliefs
are."

that a small college can maintain as
active and strong :l. chapter as the
larger universities. I am pleased with
the Work of the Grinnell chapter,” he
said, after hearing the report on the
activities of the local chapter given

Cooperation Desirable
Says Steiner, Tuesday

Dr. Edward A. Steiner opened
chapel erviccs yesterday morning.
Dr. Steiner stated that although he
knew the students were glad to get
back and to see each other, and were
glad in a measure to resume their
studies, he also hoped they were glad
to see the faculty.

“Nowhere," said Dr. Steiner, “are
the faculty of a college or university
more solicitoue for the welfare of the
students than in Crinnell. For every
accuser there are numerous excusers,
and in the end the accuser generally
loses out."

NO NEED FDR-ALARM

OVER DRINKING WATER,

Professor Hendrixson Makes Pubs
lic Statement In Regard to
Water Question.

STORM SEWER. OVERFLOW
IS CAUSE OF POLLUTION

"It is probable that the water that
is being distributed to consumers at
this moment is no worse than it was
months ago before the new reservoir
was put into use and there is no
occasion for alarm,” said Prof. W. S.
Hendrixson in answer to the question
as to the ﬁtness of 'Crinnell’s supply
of drinking water.

During the recent thaw the storm
sewer system of the city was over-
taxed and dyer-flowed into the now
reservoir, pointing the drinking water.

Mayor D. F. White advised the boil-
ing of the water used for drinking
purposes. An analysis received from
Iowa City indicated that there was
need for precaution, Another analysis
is being made at the present time.

Markos Stntcment.

The full text of the statement of
Prof. Hendrixson follows:

“It seems desirable that a brief
statement as to the duality of the city
water should be made now. A full
statement will be made just as soon as
the necessary data are at hand.

“Recent analyses have shown the
colon bacillus present, At the state
laboratory samples are now being ex
amined, from the new reservoir. each
of the old reservoirs, and the well.
The water of the new reservoir has
been shirt off for two weeks. It is
probable that the water being distrib-
uted to consumers at this moment is
no worse than it was months ago
before the new reservoir was put into
use, and there is no occasion for un-
usual alarm. The system as a whole
is certainly not right. It is the de-
termination of those in charge to lo—
cate the difficulty and remove it."

Professor Hendrixson has been in
charge of the investigation, and taxi
pccts to have the four tests which he

took to the Iowa City laboratory com-'

plated in a day hr so. Mayor White
thinks there is no need for alarm at
the prCsant time, and further states
that he does not think there’ is any

chance that the water could have be»'

come polluted from faulty sewer sys-
tems. but advances the theory that the
soft water plant located on the resere
voi grounds may have overflowed,
causing the trouble,

In case the water is follnd to be
polluted, some solution will be put
into the water to kill the germs that
will not otherwise affect the water.

One of the features of the meeting
of Missouri Valley Conference repl‘er
sentatives at Kansas City early in De-

The shortening of the Christmas va-
cation and the spring vacation makes
up the loss that was caused by the
fuel vacation,

The college has a large quantity of
coal on hand now and is exjecting the
rest of the season's shipment from the
east within a few days. All danger
or future fuel shortage has been den-

nitely removed.

During the vacation thé heat was

sllut off frorn the college buildings in-

cluding the dormitories. The fuel
necessary to heat Mears cottage and'
Smith Hall was supplied by a college
crew of woodcutters. who worked
thru the Vacation chopping Wood to
supply the heating plant.

Dormites Keep Fires
Burning D u r i n g
Holiday Season.

The Dormitories, with the exception
of Smith Hall, were deserted during
the recent enforced vacation. Twenty
men, detained by their work—both
scholastic and otherwise—remained
for some time after the rest of the
school had departed for home, Thcre
were many occupations, but four- Ion-
ian men, Walls, Knies, McCarthy and
Cuber-son, claim the distinction of hav-
ing kept the school fires burning.
These men formed a wood-chopping
gang and kept the heating plant sup-
plied with fuel when other means
railed.

Christmas was celebrated at the
Dorms, altho there were but few left
to share in the usual celebration. The
rnerrymnklng reached its height when
all gathered around the dinner table
and toasted royally. The dacation, tho
enforced, was enjoyed by everybody.
