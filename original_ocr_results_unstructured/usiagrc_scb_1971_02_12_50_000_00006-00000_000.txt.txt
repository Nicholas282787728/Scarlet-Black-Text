personal communication. The
department offers eight cour-
ses with an average enroll-
ment of 10 students. There
are 13 majors who partici*
pate in curriculum planning
through a senior seminar.
.Education was little affected
by the dropping of require-
ments. As Edwin Kulawiec ex-
plained, "We don't operate
like other departments. We
function chieﬂy to certify tea-
chers, and we have to follow
state guidelines. Also, we are
rather carefully scrutinized
by the Teacher Education CoV
mmittee.”

The department has two full'
time members and offers five
classes with an average enr
rollment of 26. This situation
will continue next year. Kular
wiec stated, “Theadministra-
tion does not envision»: broad~
ening of scope in either fac-
ulty or program for our de-
partment.”

Kulawiec did note that edu-
cation independents are up
this semester, possibly indi*
cating that students have been
freed from other commite
ments. This year 22 people
will receive teaching certi-
ficates from the department.
Psychology of Education clas-
ses have 63 students this
semester, reﬂecting a num»
ber of ”psychology majors or
people who may be looking
toward M A T programs."
This increase may also be
due to students' not having
required courses.

The History department, with
eight professors, 16 classes,
and an average of 24 students
per class, is one of the larg~
est in the school. There are

”approximately 80 majors. .

Philip Kintner, chairman of
the department, says that
there has been a 10%increase
over last semester's intro—
ductory course enrollment.
Although Kinmer ms reluc-
tant to predict the overall size

mummy

of the teaching staff for next

year, he was able to say that
instructor Howard Rabinowitz

will be gone and thatassistant
professor Thomas Schlereth
will definitely return from
Newberry.

Concerning possible course

changes for next year, Kint~
ner said, ”We’ re in the pro-

cess now of just starting in-
tensive curricular discus-
sions. I've asked the staff for
preliminary course prefer
ences, and i think there may
be some experimentation." He
stressed that, due to the
"manpower squeeze,” the
amount of experimentation
would necessarily be limited.
He also said that Schlereth
will come in from Chimgo to
attend the discussions.

The Philosophy Department
and the Religious Studies pro-
gram reported slight overall
increases. There are sixprOr
fessors, 15 classes, and an
average of 24 students per
class in the two programs.
The abolition of requirements
made the department antici~
pate greater interest in the
all‘time favorite, Intro to
Philosophy. Accordingly, an
extra section was offered, but
Howard Burkle said, ”There
were still more people than

we expected.
"We feel that we've had to

large sections for a longtime.
We need another person in the
department. Because of the
end of requirements, we ex
pect greater enrollment in all
philosophy courses."

The financial squeeze pres
cludes any plans to increase
faculty. ”When funds are av-
ailable, we‘ll be somewhere
near the top for expansion.
There are so few courses -
particularly in religious Stud’
ies ~ and so much interest."
If the faculty were expanded,
high priorities for new courr
ses include Judaicstudies, the
Prophets and possibly more
courses in noanestern reli-
gions. World religions is the
only offering in that area now.

Philosophy has 32 majors,
l3 of them seniors. Thereare
4 people with independentma-
jors in religious studies, and
a few more “ﬂirting with the
idea.”

Space Limits Fine Arts Depis.

Grinnell‘ s three fine arts
departments all have onepro-
blem in commonﬁspace. The
art department was taxed to
its limit this year, Henry
Klein, instructor in art, told
the 5&8. More space is ur-
gently needed, especially for
design courses; but because
of the tight budget, no relief
is in sight. The musicdepartr
ment is "bursting for space",
according to Richard Howe,
professor of music; the these
ter department is slightly bet-
ter off, because of thc reno~
vations they made to the base
ment of the fine arts center,
but there is still no class-
room space.

Another common problem in
the fine arts is that interest
in introductory courses was
down this semester, with the
elimination of requirements.
The common trend is towards
more participatory courses,
and in music towards the
less conventional offerings.
ART

With Professor Richard Cer-

vene on leave this semester,
the art department is temporr
arily down to three members
(there are about 25 majors).
This temporary decrease in
faculty came at a time when
there was an unprecedented
demand for many lower level
art courses, including draw-
ing, design and graphics. In
all, 125 students prerregis-
tered for those courses; and
the department was able to
take only 70 of them (and that
many only because an extra
drawing class of 20 was add-
eeschedule).

All courses,
were enrolled to their limit
this semester; and Klein ex-
pects the pressure to continue
to build. Cervene's return next
year will help, but the lack of
space makes any real im-
provement doubtful. Klein be-
lieves that the course demand,
which was concentrated in the
lower level courses this scam
ester will filter into the high
er level courses because of
the larger number of students
meeting course pre-requi-
sites.

Additions to the department,
both in faculty and in space,
probably are high on the pr-
iority list; but there will be
no additions in the foresee-
able futureanywhere, sorelief
of art's overcrowding will
probably have to wait.

MUSIC

Grinnell's music department
is undergoing some Very fun-
damental changes in outlook,
including increasing interest
in non-western, none classical
music, composition and elec-
tronic music. “Having been
gone for a year, I see a dif-
ferent kind of person coming
into the departmentfrom when
I left," Howe told the 5&8.
”Formerly, music majors
were among the more conser—
vative members ofthe campus
community; now they are a
little less straight."

A major thrust in the depart»
ment’s changing image will be
a proposal to loosen up re-
quirements for the major.
Currently there are six re
quired courses; Howe hopes in
the future there will be less
reliance on requirements and
more on counseling.

Four courses being taught
this semester emphasize the
new outlook. There are two
special topics courses; Nathan
Schwartz teaches 47 in his
course on the Romantic Sym-
phonies and Assistant Prof-
essor James Wyley limited
his course on Keyboard Mu-
sic to 12 students. David Abel
has lSnonrmajorsinhngrDup

sic and jazz; whilea composir
tion group independent taught

phen Syverudha512715,mostr
The last
course includes five physics
majors who are constructinga

There has been a 20% in-
crease in studio work this
semester, anda 400%increase
in independent work. Perfor-
ming groups are up slightly,
but since they are largely
controlled“ there is no big in‘
crease.

The department suffers from
a small number of declared
majors (14) which hopefully
will be increased with thenew
programs. “Students don’t
major in music unless they
want to be a professional in
the field," Howe said. “We
have to appeal to students
without professional inter
ests, as departments such as

David Wooldridge, Visiting
associate professor, will net
be returning nexr year; and
Assistant Professor Paul
Zonn will not be returning
from his leave. Howe hopes
to find an orchestra conductor
with interests in ethnomusic
ology, jazz and folk to fill the
vacancy.

THEATER

The theater department is
proposing the inStitution ofa
new curriculum to be effective
next semester, which includes
five lUO-level courses, three
200*level courses, two 300-
level courses and a special
topics course in addition to
independent projects and a
theater practicum to be worth
one to three credits.

In actuality, there are only
two new courseswfundamen-
tals of lighting and theater
practicum~but the proposal
contains a thorough reorgaw
ization of the department. The
lUU-level courses would in‘
clude Intro, scenic construc—
tion techniques, acting, light-
ing, and theater dance. 200*
level courses would be His-
tory I, II, and III. Directing,
and American Theater His-
tory and Drama would be the
SUOrlevel courses. Two his
tory courses, acting, direct
ing and construction would be
required for the major.

Theater enrollment dropped
drastically this semester in
comparison to a year ago, re»
fleeting the fewer courses of-
fered and the lack of interest
in intro. Some students never-
theless had to be closed out
of acting and directing. Ina
structor Rosemarie Bank will
not be returning next yearand
she will not be replaced lea-
ving theater with only"-‘3 1/2
professors. Despite me recent
drop in theater enrollment,
Instructor James Reeder
foresees an imminent in-
crease in theater enrollments
and in the arts in general. He
emphasizes that Grinnell has
an excellent performing pro-
gram for a college of its size
and emphasizes the large
number of majors (22).

Beatles Dream

through an entire list of what
he no longer believes in, and
ends with, “I don't believe in

Beatles/I just believe in me/
Yoko and me/And that's rea-
lity.” The last song is an of
terthought, called "My Mum—
my’s Dead." John once again
sings of his mother, and his
voice comes from faraway...
the song sounds likea record-
ing from the 30's.

This album will be veryhard
to take on the first listening.
It is not, on the \vhole,abeau-
tiful album. But it is a very
important album, and I feel it
is an excellent one. Forpeoplé
who still view John as Beatle-
John, this album will shock
them, ruining their dream. As
John says in “God": [was the
dream weaver/But now I’m
reborn/I was the Walrus/But
now I'm John/And so dear
friends/You'll just have to
carry on/The dreamis over.”

Oir doughnuts make an excellent accompaniment to
hot cider on a cold Iowa night. Try some tonight.
