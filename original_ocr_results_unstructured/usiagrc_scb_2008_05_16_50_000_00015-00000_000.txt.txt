Boyce takes a break from community
service to talk about water traditions

“It was too hard to study abroad Since
I was a transfer student," said Boyce. “so

the ‘study abroad purposes or crossrculr

Keeping up the rnonrhly streak through
out the winter months posed a particular
challenge to BOVCE and his friends, but it
was one that they were eager to surmount.
On February 29, their last chance to get
rn their swim for the month, Boyce and
a group or friends went out to the frozen
Arbor Lake rutenr on cutting a hole in the
ice to rake a quick drp.

“Unfortunately, some ‘superciti-
zen’ notiﬁed the authorities and we had to
go jump in rhc golrcourse pond insread,"
he sard. As for potenrtally pond-water
horn disease, he does not seem concerned.
“Hasn't happened yet,” he said.

Boyce is unafraid to try new things, and
said he will “go the mattresses" to see them
through. Boyce demonstrates incredible
persistence, be it from carrying on tradi-
tions to negotiating with a Greyhound bus
driver to let him ofrra the drtch at Exit
182 and then hitchhiklng along Highr
way 146 to make it back to Grinnell from
Chicagoia {eat that is one ofhis favorite
memories from his time at Grinnell. “It
was like trying to get back to a ‘holy land,”
said Boyce. "1 love Gi'innell, it's my favor
ite place in the world, and I Just wanted to
get back here so bad,”

For Boyce, Griniiell has been, lrke nos
where else, a place of immense growrh
and learning. The experience in the south
side of Chicago especrally heighrened his
awareness of what special lives students
here get ro lead. “As students as our fullr
time job to read, think, discuss, learn, all
on our own time." he sard. “That is such
a luxury."

Boyce will contrnue his service and
education work next year as the Grinnell
Corps Fellow in Lesotho, south Africa
teaching English. Afterwards he hopes to
do Teach for America and rs considering
a career in disability advocacy and teachr
ing. And, orcuurse, hell continue defying
authority and Jumping into lakes.
