Ten percent of students returned this semester from far-flung study-abroad locales to a
completely reconfigured cam-us. H- l u u ," u- Grinnellians feel in the new Grinnell?

“It’s hard not to like it for its \vliimsicnlncss, its different
colors, but I’m sad that the Forum isn’t what it used to be. I
think it’s great that you can see people from all three parts
of campus in one dining lull, but I feel like the location of
the RC is taking away a lot from the south campus, since
there's no large social place there anymore. I do like the
crazy colors. At ﬁrst 1 was against the crazy colors of the
JRC, but now I think it’s a fun part of it. I mean. that red
column in the flont? What’s that supposed to be?”
