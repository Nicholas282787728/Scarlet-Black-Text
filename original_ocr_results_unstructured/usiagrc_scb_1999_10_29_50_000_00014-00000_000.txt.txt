rive rhings rhar can be seen from
rhe rneer is how well rhe rraining

agreed Corringham.

The harriers will take a week off

races on the same day. At Nebraska
we had a pack splir ofabout 1:15

Corringham. “The cenrral region
is the second—toughest region in rhe
narion. 1rar rho regional meer we
have a close pack and a from run-
