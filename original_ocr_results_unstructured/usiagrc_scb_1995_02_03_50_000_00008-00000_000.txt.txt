Whatthe hell iswiththis threeshrimp
reﬁll rule at Quad? Notice the sling

that Mattisweanng? Hehad to go backso
many times that he strained his shoulder,
of course we support the state law that
mandates a clean plate for reﬁlls. but this
is ridiculous. As Jed said:"I‘he three
shrimp policy is selfdeteau'ng beeause
when you only give out threeshnmp per
plate, it forces gluttons like us to take
ﬁfteen or more plates." It would be okay

Gene Springer ‘96 Poll cal Science
My roommate from freshman year had
this annoying habit of leaving his dirty,
stinky clothes allover. I’m reminded of
aquote by Henry Rollins: “Isee the dirty
millions and try to survive somehow."

Meredith Kleinschmidt ‘97, English
She always has 8:00 am. classes so she
gets up really early every morning andl
don’t have class ‘t:il 1000. She tries to be
quiet. but the light from her closet gets
tiresome when she goes tobmshherteeth.

Anna Gregg ‘97 Biology
The most annoying thing about my
roommate is that she likes to listen to
country music when she studies.

Jed Crib ‘95 Biology

My roommate, lon, would start

slacker.
