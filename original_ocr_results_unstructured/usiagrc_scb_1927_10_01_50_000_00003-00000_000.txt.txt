any hurl: feeling about the Missouri

It is the opinion of the writer that
Grinnell will be greatly benefited by
being out of the conference. She may
again compete with schools such as
Coe, Cornell, Simpson, liorningsidc,
Des Moines University. Carleton, em,
in athletics and the alumni will again
be glad to return to see the old Grin-
Hell—Cornell football game. ‘

it is simply my feelingsino critice
ism llltendedﬁtlltlt those historic, trit-
ditional contests in the various
sports Were the "real days" and that
today they will make a, healthier ath-
letic atmosphere on the campus ,and a
better school spirit.

1 hope Gl'lnnell \vlll regain the old
schedule of Drake. Cornell, Amesl (Ice,
and other schools of the size she is
and I predict that football coaches will
be able to be normal beings with
schedules such as thosc in prefekerice
to the schedule We have this Year.
