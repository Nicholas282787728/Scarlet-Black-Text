A we1come return home rs in
store for the Grinnell College men's
basketball piayers as thcy prepare for
three more home games before the
end of the semester. This weekend
the Pioneers 11111 start the Midwest
Conrercnce season with contests
against 1111no1s College on Friday
night at 7:00pm and Knox on Satur.
day afternoon at 1.30pm.

The Grinnell cagets dropped
two games on the road this past week.
Tuesday the Pioneers were beaten at
Mt. Mercy, 127,103. "Mr. Mercy
didn't break our press like 1 had ex~
pecred them to. and as a result we
wcrc leading through much of the
first half," commented Coach DaVid
Arscneouit, “We had the opportu.
nrty to put them away, but we didn't
take advantage ofit, and we unchar—
acteristically folded when they put
together a run in the second half. 1

somewhat expected a letdown after
the performance we turned in at the
Tipoti Tourney, out 1 was some.
what disappointed We were flat on
defense and that gave us problems
tryingto gain iiioinentumon offense
as well,” Atseneault added.

Grinnell forced 37 turnovers,
including 10 steals for senior Jeff
Boyle, which breaks the previous
singiegarne record or eight that
Boyle achieved on two occasions
However, the Pioneers shot only 36
percentfrom thefield, including30.8
percent from the three—point arc.
while aiiowing their opponents to
shoot 67.6 percent from the field
Senior Ed Brands led the scoring for
Grinneu with 23 points. “1 expect
that we W|ll perform much better
when we get anothershot at them in
December,” Arscneault said

The hoppers traveled to Indr.
anola to face Simpson last Saturday.
Simpson, which had beaten the P1—
oneers last season, 167/149, once
again ran the Pioneers out of the
gymwitha 157.137vicrory. Assem—

ingly endless series of fast breaks led
Simpson to 77 percent Shooting for
the game, while the Pioneers shot
only 38.5 percent from the floor, in—
ciudrng 4.32 from the [hrEe/point
line in the first half, Coach Arsene<
ault said, “lfl had to coach this style
of defense against a team with as
many great athletes and ball handlers
as Simpson every night, I’d be out of
a job. They really put on a passing
dime and broke our press all night."
Despite the effectiveness of Simp—
son's running game. the Pioneers st111
forced 3O turnovers. bringing their
opponents average to 35 per game.

Brands paced the Pioneers with
36pointswhileBoyleadded24p01nts
and 14 assists. Senior Andris Upitis
collected 12 rebounds while junior
Jason Schubert chipped in a career
high 10 points. Atseneault added,
”In general I was pleased With our
effort all throughout the lineup We
shot poorly and never were allowed
to get comfortable on defense, but
the effort was there."

On Tuesday the cagets returned

home and tried to snap their losing
streak against Luther. Grinnell dee
feared the Norse lastyear inDecorah.
but the Pioneers faced a team that
returned all five starters and, accord»
mg to Arseneault, “The most explo<
sive piayer in the Iowa Conference in
point guard Tony Campbell." Luther
continuously broke Grinnell‘s press
and Grinnell suffered a disappoint—
ing loss, 114-79.

The Pioneers on Friday will host
Illinois Co11ege, a team which failed
to win a conference game last season
but which returns all fivestarters. On
saturday the opponent is Knox,
whichwillfearure fourreturningstart—
ers and was picked for second in the
south division by Midwest Confer—
ence coaches. “We're going to be
facing teams that know us a halo
better, The outcomes ofthe next few
games W|ll be determined by hoiv
we11 we execute. We’re happy to be
back home — with the soft rims and
good environment at Darby. the re—
sults ofthe last twogames might have
been different,” said ATSEnEaulL
