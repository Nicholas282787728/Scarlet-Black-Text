sic, truthful factknames, where we
werecoming from,respectively~and
then moved on to the thrill of more
questionable tall tales. We told some
good ones,butthey beatus. Wemade
the mistake of bringing up beer.

“Yeah, we like to drink beer,” one
of the hitchhikers said, and pointed to
the man next to him. "Him and me,
for instance, like, last weekend we
get ﬁve cases and drank ‘em in front
of the tube, eh?"

“Just the two of you?" Michael
asked, incredulously. “That‘s 60 beers
apiece in two days!"

“Yeah, well,” the man shmgged.
apologetically, “We‘re net as young
as we used to be. eh?"

aren’t necessarily folks you want to
keep as pcnpals after thejoumcy, but
you always get people that have at
least one basrc belief in common—
they recognize the fact that for all the
modem societal trappings of conve-
nience, we‘re still, underneath it all,
born to move. At some deep, inner
level, we human beings are eternally
and inescapably nomadic. So when
hitching, concentrate on the fact that
no matter how bizarre the conversa-
tion might get, it’s bound to be all
right as long as you all keep moving
forward, as Tom Robbins' character
Sissy in Even Cowgirls Get the Blue:
would say. There’s always so much
to learn.

And you know, if I took myself
seriously,1justmightsay that‘s nota
bad way to look at life.

 

SCARLET & BLACK:

MAGILL: Financial aid reduction
spawns ideological questions

continued from page 7

student would have to leave Grinnell
ducto financialproblems.Tobemore
succinct, Grinnell promised that the
quality of a student’s work and not
the size of his or her bank account
would be Lheprinciplc dcterminantof
one‘s ability to stay here for all four
years. Recent events seem to indicate
that this promise was more rhetorical
than substantive.

The number of students who have
either taken leave this semester or
havelcftentirelyductofinancialprohe
lems seems to be the the highest inmy
years here. At the same time, many
students have faced drastic cuts in
theiraidpackages.Thispracticeseems
to have nothing to do with an in-
creased ability to pay, but rather on
the ﬁnancial aid office's opinion that
a family can pay a few hundred, or in
some cases a few thousand, more

dollars. Many wonder how tlteirfami»
lies can meet the increased burden:
many families cannot meet it.

What is at stake is not the survival
ofthis institution. Grinnell Collcgcis
here today and will remain here for
the foreseeable future. Many schools
around the country are in dire finan-
cialstraits.N0,Grinnelldoes notface
the same threat. We face one for less
obvtous; we face a threat to our char»
acter.

You told me earlier this year that
one of the best things about Grinnett
was thatbeeausc of its wealth you did
not have to be ”afraid ofbreaking it."
The threat is not that we will bc bror
ken; the threat is that we will be
warped.

Grinneilians have heard about the
need for increased diversity. The ef-
fort is certainly a worthwhile one.
The problem is that if we systematir
cally lower our aid, we may losethc

greatest diversity we have: soc iocco~
nomic diversity. We really could end ‘
up being a small New England liberal .
arts college in the middle of Iowa.
Grinnell does the improbable by iak» ‘
ing a collection of people who mighty
never otherwise meet and throwing~
them together in an isolated environ-
ment. Many would tell you that it L
could not be done. We have done it. ,
Maybe it’s a fluke, but that makes
little difference. How ever we ‘
achieved what we have, we must bev
careful notto placertatrisk. Wemust
work at all costs not only to maintain ‘
it, but to expandit.Tragicatly, itdoesr
not appcar the administration sharesr
thts view.

I await your response.

Sincerely, ‘

Jordan Magill ‘
