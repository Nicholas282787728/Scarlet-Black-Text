Numbers down, but

housing hassles rise

by Doug Schultc

Even though
students living oif~campus has
increased greatly in the last five
years, as Sue Crim points out in her
statement opposite this article, the
number of students living in
college owned houses has
decreased.

The demand for such living
options has dropped even more.
This, and the unstable occupancy
afmany of the houses has given the
Student Affairs Office its share of
administrative headaches.

According to Dean of Student
Affairs James Tederman, when
the houses were iirst offered
many more groups of students
wanted to live in them than there
were houses. Last spring, there
were more houses than groups.

Currently there are four conps
being occupied, although the
college owns five. This fall. due to
insuiticient occupancy. Student
Affairs came close to shutting one
other one down, but its minimum
quota was filled the third Week of
the Semester.

Other houses (noncoops) have
experienced similar difficulties.
Despite bare minimum occupancy,
3816 must nevertheless maintain
them, and, in the case of
Townhouse, reefers had to be

iinancial gap which must be shut.

turnover of personnel in many of
the houses.

According to Tederman. some of
the houses have had as much as a
50 per cent turnover in occupants
from registration last spring to this
(all. One house changed coor-
dinators as much as three or iour
times in that period, Considerable

distance phone calls were resultant

Tederman admitted that failure to
demand alternates contributed to
their problems.

The anxieties which student
occupants encounter in dealing
with the rapid turnover are no less,
and perhaps more, than the. ad
ministratian’s, At the least,
students find themselves having to
adapt to several new housemates
during the course oi the year. At

students find themselves amidst a
house full oi strangers, and must

not counted on.

Tederman, “They have a tendency
not to cooperate."

Despite other problems such as
cleaning them after the iinals rush
in the spring, Tederman sees off-
campus housing as an important.
necessary alternative to residence
hall living.

For some students dorm life is an
unappetizing existence. Grinnell
College cooperative housing otters
an alternative. Coops are off
campus college owned houses in
which a group of students sleep,
eat their meals, and live in a
community-home type at-
mosphere. The four coops are
Pine Tree House, East Street Cos
op, Ccnoco House, and Townhouse.

Inhabitants of all the Coops
expressed similar reasons ior
living in a house. Dissatisfaction
with SAGA and dorm life were the
two most important. Members of
Pine Tree House and 1130 East
Street Coop are vegetarians, so
living in a house enables them to

Cook and eat meatless meals
together. Townhouse is a project
house designed to acquaint its
members with urbanstarm living.

Some members of the Comet) C0-
cp noted that coop living is
cheaper and more convenient than
living in an apartment. Most
seemed to enjoy the familyrlike
atmosphere and being able to do a
lot of things together with other
members.

This type of living arrangement
requires more participation and
responsibility than dorm life.

Townhouse appoints a job ioreman

People seem to care about the
houses so eventually the chores are
completed.

Food is bought from ma y
places. All the Co-ops participate t
an extent in the Grinnell College
Food Cn-op, a loosely run
organization which huys its to
from farms and warehouses in
Marshalltown and Iowa City. Many
members of chops have noted the
lack of organization of the Food Co-
op so shopping is often done
elsewhere. The local grocery store
and Van’s Health Food Store are
frequented oiten. Buying tood is
considered one of the rotating jobs
at all coops except Townhouse.
Their food is bought by two regular
people who are also in charge oi
the financial books.

Buying food is the large
iinancial problem for co-ops. Eacr
house has its own arrangement.
Basically, members contribute
about $10 $12 weekly to the food
budget which at the end of the year
adds up to about half SAGA s boar
charge of $650 (The room charge
is the same for all collegeowned
housing except for an additional
$25 damage deposit.) There is
general agreement that the quality
oi food at coops is much better
than at the dining halls, although
