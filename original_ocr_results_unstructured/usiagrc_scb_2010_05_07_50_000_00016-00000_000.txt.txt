Now you get to do it!
The new RFlD renders it the dining hall are

just as obnoxious as the magnetic strip rcnders, if
not more so. were still requlled to remove our
P-cal‘ds from our wallets, purses, em. so the con-
venience tlnt could have been is negated. We still
stand in long lines, so the process isn't streamlined
any more thin wuh the strip renders—ind (lit: pro-
cess is more chaotic il‘anytlnng.The only possiisle
beneﬁt of the new system is smiimtron. since the
workers don't havc to touch our Ptcnrds. But if
sunltution‘s the reason {or switthuig, they're doing
it wrong. More people touch the serving utensils
than my Ptchi‘d. Finally, as mentioned in arbitrary
analysis, the senior thing is dumb. It might take
more work to migrate seniors over to the new sySt

Be thankful for what ya got

1 don't usimlly eat in the dining hall anymore.
but occasionally I guilt one of my friends with a
meal plan into guest-passing me in. Guys, unless
you live off campus without n meal plan, you prob-
ably don’t appreciate the dining hall like I do. 1
can choose from so many things that I DON'T
HAVE TO COOK MYSELF! It’s great. But
when I want A Monterrey chicken sandwich, and
the kid in front of mo takes the LAST THREE,
shit gets red. I monn,corno on guy. 1 know at least
one or thosei going to ond up being tlllown away.
SO LEMME HAVE IT.
AND WATCH YO WASTE!

While I applaud the efforts of the Reil

many allies by singling out ﬁrst you mule
athletes for mandatory reteducanonThese
kind of“guilry until provcn innocent" generale

that we athletes are anything less than true
