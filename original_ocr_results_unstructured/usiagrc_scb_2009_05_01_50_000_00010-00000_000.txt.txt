and the dﬁmzt spatial sailings thatgaide our daily routines.

THE SPENCER GRILL:
THE DWELLER'S DOMAIN

After the main dining hall, the Grill
buzzes as the center of the JRC. And it ,8,
nuns the favor, helping groggy students get
their morning coffee buzz on with the new
Er’fmling Grinnell Blend. What else about
this place makes it such a popular lung ollt
spot. a place notable l‘or its culture of“Grill
Dwellers" ithosc people who just ncvcr
stem to lcavc> Its social nature, bright, airy
space, and, or course, the food exert a mag-
netic pull over all corners of campus. or
maybe it's just the chorus of “Campus oi
Dining?" singing its Siren call.

At the center of the Grill culture is its
function as a gathering place for students,
faculty, and even little Grinnell twerps on
skateboards. lt acts as a common ground
and, with the recently reupholstered couch-
es wide enough for two, the furniture and
layout ofthe space itself fosrers a feeling of
community,

“It's the place where you watch inter-
actions." said Julia Fine '10. “You can see
everyone, or go ifyou're trying to run into
someone."

Because of the inevitable socmlizing
which seems to chamcterize behavior in the
Grill, it is a notorious black hole for schools
work. “i go here ifl want to do work, but
don't really need to. 1 only got done about
50 percent of what I intend to do when 1
come here," said Zoe Scltcin ’12.

For those who wanr to get work done,
headphones arc a mus[#tlit:y are a prolif-
ic accessory for students tapping away on
their laptops nestled on the couches. “1 do
work here, but only with headphones, and
because there’s always the opportunity for
a distraction with all the people," said Miss
cha Ghadiri ’12.

And then there is the main attraction:
the food. Long lines at lunchtime and the
ten minutes between class periods mean the
Grill employees have their hands full trying
to feed the hungry students ordering their
wheat bagel with cream cheese or Italian
sub outtake.

Even though food attracts people to
the Grill, some students still have sugges-
tions about how to improve the menu st:-
lections. “How about free rice krispie treats
or cheaper refills on coffee?” said Hannah
Lytle '11. .

While the Grill may still have its tics
tractors, its controversial spellingito “e"
or not to “6"?7 its rather inﬂated prices,
and its occasional annoying loud laughter,
it will always at least have one thing that
trumps all‘thc Big cookie.

THE LAUREL LEAF LOUNGE:
TOP 5 NAPPING SPOT ON CAMPUS

There is one constant in the Laurel
Leaf Loungeinappcrsr Better known as

the ”fireplace lounge," the pastel checkered
couches with their large slouchy cushions
just beg the weary to rest. While wrnter
brought few embers to the massive black
stone ﬁreplace, its presence alone is enough
to suggest the warm and calm tone students
seek here.

“I like this room because there is the
white noise in the background, unlike the
library where it is completely silent," Lau-
rcn O'Hait'lz said

The atmosphere of the fireplace lounge
starkly contrasts from the noisy lobby right
outside its entranceway. On the Outsidet
sounds of students bustling to and fro funs
uel through and amplify into the big cirr
cular lounge. But inside, the lounge is a
cozy refuge with its soft lighting from the
UFO’llke chandelier and small box Wln-
dows offering a peek to the outside. It is an
alternative to the Grill—a place for a quiet
conversation, typing away on an essay, or
catching some quick shut-eye.

“lt's comfortable, quiet. The only time
it kills me is when there's someone snore
ing loudly during a nap" said Jacob Reiss
berg ‘10. “You can hear people outside, the
sound kind of curves into the space.”

THE SECOND FLOOR:
ATOP ALL THE CHAOS, A NUMBER
OF FAVORABLE SPACES

Studying students can enjoy the back
ground noise of the bustling center below
while escaping distraction in this lesser
known but enjoyable spot atop the Grill. It
still appeals to people who want the stimu»
lation and energy of a public space, but
with the treehouse perch, this second ﬂoo
area has a much different feel. Tables and
comfortable couches create an ideal meet»
ing place for groups or individuals lookin
for a more removed location to focus.

"You can hear everyone talking in th
Grill below but _without the distractions,’
Ellie Deal '11 said. “Ifyou really feel like
it, you can look over the edge and creep o
people."

In the conference rooms lining the
edges of the second ﬂoor, white boards and
sprawling tables, as well as a lot more prir
vacy, make these spaces a hot commodity
Massive projection screens also make the
conference rooms ideal movie-watching lot
cations when students’ work is done.

And then there are all those little nooks
and crannies. Red, yellow and rainbow up-
holstety brighten these pockets of space in
the JRC, such as the one that pcors over into
the ﬁreplace lounge. At the top ofthe main
stairway, a cradle of dark maroon cushions
ing offers itselfas the arguably most invit-
ing place to curl up with those 300 pages
of reading on Italian Renaissance art you've
been putting off until now. or better yet
curling up for a little camap.
