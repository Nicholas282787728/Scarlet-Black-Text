Strings ’Em Up

by Steve Warch

The men's tennis team improved
its record to 6-2 this past Week with
wins over Drake University and
Grand View College. Last Friday,
coming on a disappointing 9-0 loss
to the University of Northern Iowa,
the Pioneers routed Drake 7-2 Vic-
tories ior Grinnell in singles came

Phil Rutherford, and Ben Lezin
Grinnell swept all three of the
doubles matches with the teams of
Bridgeerinear, hutheriordRich
Pearce, and LelinSteve Warch all
playing solid tennis, Minear and
Bridges won a close threerset
match, Rutherford and Pearce
won easily in strait sets, and
Warch and Lezin overcame a 5-0
deficit in the second set to Win 5.2V

The victory over Grand View
came much less easily. Aiter the

Warch and Lezin, after losing the
first set. came back to win 5-7, 6-!.
6~2, and clinch the match for Grinr
hell. But spectators and players
alike agreed that the most thrilling
moment in the match came when
Rich Pearce, in a desperate at-
tempt to reach a Grand View dropr
shot, ran into the net and bounced
over, landing on a pile oi rackets,
towels, and water jugs. “It was
like a scene from all~star wrestl~
ing.” commented Pearce's partner
Phil Rutherford.

The 5-4 victory over Grand View
avenges last year's H 1055 and
gives the Pioneer netmen an im-
portant boost of confidence as they

Baseball Splits Doubleheader

by Bob Litton

Believe it or not. there's
something else besides the in-
famous KDIC scandal which
deserves some attention, The
Pioneers are atop the Midwest
Conference Southern Division
after splitting their doubleheader
against secondrranked Knox last.
Saturday. A hard-iought mo vic-
tory in the ﬁrst game followed by a
126 loss in the second upped the
Pioneers‘ record to an impressive
Sal in conference. Gotta like that

In the iirst game, Grinnell eXr
ploded {or 11 runs on 15 hits. While
a little shaky at timﬁ. pitcher
Brad Sheridan (three Ks, three
BBS, 13 hits) hung on to capture the
win, going the distance for the
third time this season. If Grinnell

maintains these quality perior.
mances on the mound, the
Pioneers will be in serious contenr
tion for the lead all season.

The second game, uniortunately,
didn't have such a sweet ending (or
even a nice beginning, ior that
matterl, The Pioneers were iorced
to play catch-up ball all day, and
even with their parade oi 14 hits,
they were unable to catch the
Siwash, That's all right, though 7
one out oi two on the road isn't bad
atall.

Grinnell has a chance to build on
their first-place standing with a
doubleheader tomorrow at Cornell
(2-5). Last time out they beat the
Rams 572. May history repeat
itseli.

Tracksters Somber,
Hopeful After Loras

by Katherine Fairbanks

Perhaps it was the long bus ride
to Dubuque, perhaps it was the hot
day, or perhaps it was the competi-
tion, but for whatever reason, the
Grinnell men's and women's track
teams did notcount this pastSatur-
day’s 1938 Iowa Outdoor State
Track and Field Championships at
Loras College as one of their better
meets, By the time the day of com-
petition had ended, the women had
finished seventh with 24 points and
the men had finished eighth with 43
points.

Although the overall results
were not what the athletes and
coaches had hoped ior, there were
still some notable individual perr
l'ormances: Abby Green placed se-
cond in the high jump with a jump
oi 5'0"; Dave Hammond placed
third in the steeple chase;
Jonathan Lave placed third in the
5000m, and stove Piper placed
fourth in the loowmr Head coach
John Reinhold, when asked how he
felt about the meet, said, “It was
tough — being jammed into a
school bus ior three hours, having
your insides rearranged, and then
trying to go out and perform.”
Looking at the season as a whole,
Reinhold was optimistic. “Con-
sidering the small team and
numerous injuries, we’re looking
pretty good,” he commented in
addition, he said that several
athletes were pertorming excepr

tionally well. and cited Henry
Vogelman and Joanne Sackett as
prime examples. Vogelman placed
third in the shot and sixth in the
discus (a new event for nlml this
past Saturday, prompting Rein-
hold to remark. “Henry is just
throwing phenomenally " Joanne
Sackett competed in a separate
meet this weekend. the Lady
Bulldog invitational. held at Drake
University. Sackett competed in
the heptathlon, which consists oi
the loam hurdles, zoom. 800m, high
jump, long jump. shot put, and
javelin. She placed sixth in the col
lege division, where she was one of
three Division-ill athletes in a iield
of Division-ii competitors. .

Many oi the members of the -
track team seemed discouraged by
their most recent meet, but Kirk '
Marty, who placed iiith in the pole
vault, ieels that he is right on
schedule [or a iinish in the top
three in the conierence meet. His
goal {or the season is 15'1", which
would qualify him for competition
at the national level. Marty is very
optimistic about this goal and said,
”I think i can do it," and a iew
seconds later, “I know i can do it»
Withatl ’ ttieotthatl“lttiiok
i can, I thi k i ca’h“*‘a‘ttiiiidel there
should be some good performances
turned in this weekend, when the
track team next competes at the
Central invitational.
