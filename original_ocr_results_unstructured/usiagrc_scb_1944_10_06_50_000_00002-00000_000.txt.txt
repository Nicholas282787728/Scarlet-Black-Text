L'Allegro - -

By Harold L. Clapp

Your editor»i hief will be doubly disapr
pointed in this alleged editoriall In the
first place, written by one who is far from
enthusiastic about journalism as generally
practiced, it will probably violate every rule
of editorial writing. Secondly, I am surely
expected to voice pet grievances and strike
out at annoying student practices, or ideas,
or traditions. You see, last year the editor
heard me refer to the anonymous author
01" a very silly Scarlet and Black editorial
as a “spoiled brat," alld so she has pigeon-
holed me as a carping critic. Let this be
a lesson to her not to jump at conclusions
—a lesson, alas, learned by all too few of
her journalistic colleagues,

No, bitterness is not in my heart and
orchids, not scallions, are aboth to he
strewn all over the place. Let me reserve
the good old campus prerogative of griping
for later on, if the occasion arises. As

presumably it will. But for today, Hence,
loathed Melancholy . . . l

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

The truth is, Ladies and Gentlemen of
the Student Body, I like you. I take off
my hat to you You have been told of your
special responsibility this year so repeat—
edly that you probably deserve great credit
for not having rel'used it out of a spirit of
independence. Fortunately, you have as-
sumed it because, I suspect, you recognized
it before we all started telling you about
it And you have done so with all enthuse
iasm that would gratify ally Grinnell fan.

The whole atmosphere is right this year.
You sound and act and look as if you are
having fun, in your work as ill your play,
and education should be fun The best stu-
dent speech I have heard ill eighteen years
in colleges and universities was given at
convocation this falll The S & B has started
off splendidly and its staff already deserves
public congratulationieven though I may
not have agreed with all its editorials and
in spite of the friendly kidding which I
could not resist, above The social program
is being carefully and ingeniously thought
out and carried out and, at the risk of re
vealing my senility, I must submit that
it is a better program than the old monot-
onous round of generally unimaginative
dances, The men, unaffectedly and with
dignity, are playing their essential role in
the way that the best of Grinnell men have
always answered a challenge

And so one could continue

Perhaps, this early in the year, we are
all too conscious of our responsibility. Per-
haps too many things are being done be-
cause we feel that we must maintain the
Grinnell spirit. Perhaps we think too mucll
about the things that must be remembered
about the Grinnell of yesterday and must
be kept intact for the boys, when they come
back. But habit is a wonderful thing, and
this ovelzconsciousness, where it exists, will
pass while the things it is creating will
endure

I for one have stopped worrying about
the Grinnell that the boys will find on their
return. Lament if you must, but it cannot
be the same Grinnell. It is already clear
that it will be a rejuvenated and a better
Grinnell.
