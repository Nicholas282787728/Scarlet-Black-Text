Popular Numbers Appeal Strongly
To Local Students States
Critic In Review.

SOLOS FEATURE CONCERT

Concert by Famous Military Band
Well Received By Audience
In Men’s Gymnasium.

By Aileen . illigilli

The immediate appeal of popular
music to ai-innell students was dem—
onstrated at the concert of the United
States Army band in the blens' gym-
nasium Tuesday night. The most
vigorous applause of the evening was
given in response to “I Still Love
You." featuring the hanjcist, “Ra-
nlonn,” played as a saxaphone solo,
and “Rain,” dashed off by the xylo-
phonist.

The college students were not hesi-
tant to respond enthusiastically to the
other numbers, however, and will
probably retain just as lasting and
favorable an impression of the over—
ture “Duarte” by Vega, “In a Chip-
ese Garden" by Ketelbey, “Washing
ton Evening Star" by Stannard, and
“The Year 1312' by Tchaikowskv.
Their attention was held throughout

,a long concert of twentyrtwo selecA
tions by the versatility and artistry
of the musicians,

baud .Ully Directed

The band was alw '5 under effects
we control of the director, Capt. Wi
liam J, Stanuerd, and played with
fine shading and precision. The play-
ers here also ably directed by the
second leader, Thomas F. Darcy. in
the pcrioi-mance of one group of
numbers.

The solo numbers were more out—
standing than the-selections played
by the band ensembleu The cadenza
and ll‘iplerlonguing performed by
Thomas Darcy in his trumpet solo,
"The Commander," were far above
the range of most trumpet players-
abilities His two encores. “Minne-
tonka" by Leurance and ”Irish Folk
Song" were also wcll executed.

Eugene Hostetter played the saxa-
phone with a melodious tone that is
seldom achieved on that instrument
His numbers included "Valse Vanite”
by Weidoft. “At Dawning" by Odds
man. and “Ramona" by Wayne.

John haumann gave a dashing, rib»
pling group of solos on the xylophone
playing "Scintillata," by Perkins,
”Jorial Jasper" by Green, and “Rain"
by Ford.

The band’s program was concluded
with the selection which is 2 favorite
of the United states Army and of the

American people—“The Star Spang-
led Banner."

now seems to be in fairly good Condlv

set of backs are Flowers, Tomkins,
Boyce, Mason and several others who
carry on with a right good will where
the others leave off. Flowers, a track
man, is the tiectest fellow on the
field. The chief reason that he has not
seen more service this year is that
an early season ankle injury has
bothered him somewhat.
