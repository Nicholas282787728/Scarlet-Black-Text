"Hypnotism is still the stepchild a6 medi-
cine,” Dr. Polgar explains, and it has many
other lhevapewlc uses which have nol been
developed. its value has been deﬁnliely proved
in treatment of phobias, manias, split person-
aliiies and bad hobiis. He tells of one case In
which he hypnotized an old lady who had a
morbid fear of built deniisis and anesihelics

graup to sleep. The three subierts were the
