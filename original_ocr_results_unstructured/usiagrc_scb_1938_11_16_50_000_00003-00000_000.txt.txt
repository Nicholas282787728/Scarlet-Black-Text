ciation, further recommended that
the dances be publicized to the
effect that all students are wel—
come, that stag dances will be
featured, and that the program
is under the town men’s sponsor-
ship.

“The town men do not want
Friday night dances at the White
House to be totally dating af-
fairs," Vaughn emphasized. "Stu-
dents with dates will be welcome,
of course, but what we want to
impress upon the student hody is
that men and women are wel-
come to come singly to dance,
play cards, ping pong or engage
in any other form of recreation
offered by the White House."

Suggest Confined Dancing.

Robert Mannheimer, men's
chapel committee chairman. and
Robert Schutt, student auditor,
both suggested that dancing be
confined to only one room of the
house instead of two as has been
the custom on Friday nights this
year.

This suggestion was immediate
ly denounced.

Board Releases
Rules For Quad

Rec Room Use

Rules for the quadrangle recrea-
tion room were released this week
by Margaret Hale, president 01
the League hoard.

According to Miss Hale, the
recreation room will he open on
Sunday through Thursday, from
7:30 to 10 p. m for mLVed
groups. Friday and Saturday
nights, it will be closed to dates.
as it is to he used by the women
only on those nights.

Lights must be turned on
when the room is in use, Miss
Hale said, and the room may be
reserved at any time for private
dinners, club meetings and social
meetings by applying to Grace
Blaikie, chairman of the recrea-
tion room, or to the dean of wom-
en's office.

tion, asked the body. “To make it
an all-student recreation center
and not a town men's budding.
Enough dances are on the camv
pus as it is on Friday nights.
That’s why the White House was
established—to provide a place
for students on Friday nights who
do not care to dance."
Plan Compromise.

“They don’t have
shouted Miss Hale.

It was then suggested by Moehl
that dances at the White House
be alternatedione every other
Friday night.

Vaughn compromised by recom-
mending that a month of Friday
night dancing he given, followed
by a month of no dancing on
those nights, as a means of find-
ing out how popular the town
men's dances are.
Three Weeks Trial.

The suggestion
proved.

It was finally moved by Mann—
heimer that the council vote by
question, “Resolved: that the
Student Council grant the town
men's organization a three weeks’
trial period to hold Friday night
dances at the White House,"

The motion was seconded by
Schutt, and the council voted in
favor.

Phillips Sees Signs of
Weakening in Church

“’I'Ile church of today is showing
signs of weakness, and several
new movements are coming into

asserted Dr. John
pastor of the First Central Con-
gregational church, Omaha. Ne
and conference forum leader,yes-
terday afternoon.

Dr. Phillips pointed to the rise
of such divergent groups as the
Oxford movement, which believes
in the community of religious ex-
periences and social problems. and
the Barth society, which believes
that society is wholly evil and
cannot be saved, to illustrate his
belief that people are becoming
discontent with the church of to-
day.

in order to allay the spirit of
discontent. Dr. Phillips empha-
sized the need for a closer rela-
tiohshlp between the church and
its members.

Ministers must lead a truly
Christian life without petty quar-
rels and other human failings,
Dr. Phillips concluded.

the love of God,” said the Rev.
Ashley Day Leavrtt, of the How-
ard Memorial church, Brookline,
Mass, in his second Gates lecture
last night in Herrick chapel.

Included in Dr. rLeaviLt's text.
“The Next step in Evolution,”
was that the great objective ofme
day is to make the world better.

He went on to mention the
standards of moral value and
achievements. “The business of
religion,” said Dr. Leavitt, "is to
make had people good, banish
evil, and establish justice."

He continued his lecture by eme
phasizing the importance of the
soul. “The soul is not a bit of
luggage. We have just as much
soul as we have spiritual life.
Men and women have risen over
all differences by the aid of the
soul," he said. -

Dr. Leavitt concluded by any
swering the question, ”What is
the measure of your soul?” “A
soul is as high as a man can
think, as long as a man can en-
dure. and deeply as you love." he
asserted.
