Student Initiatives on the ballots with new rules

Ten students attended the initiative open forum. Tuesday

up late, Only 51% ofthc campus voted in the October batch of
student initiativesiit seems as if Grinnell students has thus
far cast a ballot of“no preference" when it comes to voting on
campus issues.

on Wednesday and Thuisdny. campus voted on a second
iound of Student Initiatives—the tit st ofits
kind in recent memory. In response to (our
tentious ballot counting in September's ini-
tiative voting, SGA and the election board
created a policy guiding the counting ot“no
preference"votes.

1n the first round of initiative balloring,
votes of“no preference" were equated with
“for"votcs towards the two-thirds threshold
required to pass an initiative.

Now “no preference" votes will only
count toward the 50 percent votet quorum. but not toward the
measure ofstudent support, according to SGA Administrative
Coordinatorjoscf Schneider’O‘? (see sidebar),

SGA, after facing complaints about lack of publicity for
initiatives, has also increased its gettouttthetvotc efforts'l‘hey
did this by postering more and also by “talking it up as much as
possible." Election Board has also sent more allrcampus emails
than during the first initiatives and Senator elections.

Schneider attributed low turnout to the timing of the first
round of initiatives. “Initiatives are done ieally early in the yeai,

which is vely hard for new students and students coming back
to remember that [initiatives] happen inuncdiately,"hc said.

Looking toward the tuture, SGA is discussing possible into
piovemcnts to the initiatives system, according to Julie Hoye
’09, SGA vice-president of academic affairs, Election Board is
considering including ini ntive statements on the acrual ballot
rather than splitting them into two scpamtc documents. Adt
ditianally, SGA members have considered adding a “cost"comr
poncnt to the initiative statements which would
indicate the anticipated costs associated with each
initiative. “Hopefully [a cost component would] let
students think about what they are willing to do for
the iuitiative,"Hoye said

As usual, this group of initiatives was an «In?
tic mix of playful and serious proposals. “Student
initiatives are a chance for snidents to take it upon
themselves to change things on campus," said SGA
President Neo Morake ’09.

Leah Krandel ’09 and Latona Giwa '10 co
sponsored a “Social Justice Peer Education Program" initiative.
Giwa said the program would be “a student facilitated pi ogram
for students to educate ourselves and dialogue about issues of
difference and how we deal with difference at Grinnell."

other initiatives were more playful. Emily Bajet ’12 resulr
rected a proposal foi the acquisition ofa foam machine. “[The
foam machine] is a tool for the ultimate dance party experi-
ence," Bajet said. “[And creates] a lot ottoam that you dance
in.

campus, Greene said Student Affairs would “much rather focus
our energy and talents on howwe can do things more safely."
As part of this effort, SGA President Neo Morake '09 and
college employees attended a conference in September on col-

Hinds-Brush said that changes brought
about by harm reduction would likely in-
volve a more structured approach to deal-
ing with students after a hospitalization, in-
cluding an assessment of the student's health and
followtup meetings with counselors.

While the cause for the increase in hospitalizations
remains unclear, HindsrBrush said that the amount of no",

questions asked at the end ofthe event were either posed by a
veteran, or by a family member oft veteran.

But while Dole’s speech may have been the only event in
the series to take place on Grinnells campus, students were
still involved in the week’s celebration of wtcmns Kicking
off the series on Tuesday, a mural painted by Thomas Agtan
’09 was unveiled at the Veterans Memorial Building, where it
will become a permanent ﬁxture.

The group organizing the events commissioned Agran
over the summer to create a mural to celebrate the veterans
from World War 11. "They wanted representation ofthe var
ious branches of the armed forces at the time of World War
11,” Agran said. "They were also enthusiastic and receptive to
my wanting to include imagery from the domestic front and
those things as well.”The six by ten-toot mural was painted
using oil on a panel cantms. The triptych was painted entirely
in black and white.

"It was a real privilege to be chosen to do it, and so far
it’s been well received from all the veterans I’ve talked to,” he
said. “I think that’s an important feedback."
