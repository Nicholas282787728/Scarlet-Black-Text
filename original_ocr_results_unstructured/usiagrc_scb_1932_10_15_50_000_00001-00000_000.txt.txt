Although the chapter did not make
it a permanent scholarship, a clause
was added to the by-laws to continue
it each year if the chapter funds were
sufficient.

Convention Cancelled

The annual national convention of
Sigma Delta, which was to have been
held at Iowa State college at Ames
this fall, was cancelled by the nation-
al organization due to lack of funds
to finance traveling expenses and
speakers fees.

Teget New Secretary

Because of the length of the busi~
ness meeting Wednesday night, Rich-
ard Phillips, managing editor of the
Grinnell Herald, who was to speak,
postponed his talk until the next
meeting, His subject was to have
been “Advertising.“

Marvin Teget, a junior, was elected
secretary of the Grinnell chapter to

tion of Edward Danforth. Mr, Dan-

after the game is finished. After their
impressive showing against the poW<

points, and they are decided favorites
to win the game this afternoon.
James Out of Lineup

Clarence "Snap” James will be out
of the lineup with an injured knee
and will be unable to show his home
town how the game is played. The
loss of James has thrown a kink in
the pass offense which has proven
most valuable to the Pioneers so far
this season.

However, Wesley Clark, versatile
sophomore, will probably be able to
replace James at halfback berth.
Clark is reckless with his aerial pro-
cedure, but he has been able to find
his man with unusual ability so far
this season. He made the lone touch-
down in the Michigan State game
and Was responsible for another in
the game against Penn, with one of
his lengthy heaves.
