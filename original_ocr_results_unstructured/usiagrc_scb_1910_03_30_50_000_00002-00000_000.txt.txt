We oiiei- in today’s issue or the

Scarlet and Black what seems to he
one or the simplest and it the same
time most ellectire methods or regu
lating outside activities that has liceu
suggested. After all the heart ot this
suggestion, rniplocn the class work- is
the one thing in mind in em us out
this plan on any basi . in just one re-
spect. however, this is inadequate and
this is the possibility oi allowing a
man to take any activities to the
extent that he would neglect them
thereby causing a decided inconveni
ence to those with whom he is hssociab
ed, and doing an injustice to himself.
At the present time there are too many
men and women in the college who
have accepted more work than they
can do, who are at the same time good
students. This is not right. it is not
enough to simply (mind the ohligation
to the college. There is an obligation
to those who have chosen the student
for the responsibility that he is can
ing.

Better methods in the class room
will, however, produce a better grade
a: scholarship. Ttiis is an improvement
that doesn’t require a system.

To Editor af Scarlet and Blac .

the chances are that he would see to it

for the instructors to hold the students

necessary to stirreh courses. Now
put it up to the student, it he wants
a grade let him do the work. The
stndcnt would knaw how he was doing
and it he wanted a passing grade had
enough he will study. The
trouhie in Grinnell is that certain
courses are given so a student should

worry along.

By holding them uh to it they will
talre an interest and especially the
sending of marks home will tend to en-
courage. The regulation oi things
