nell team between halves of the
freshman football game tomorrow
morning.

The affair iiill be run over
new three nrile course. according
to Neumnn Fell. captain of the
varsity crossecolmtl'y tcam.

Cornell probably has one of the
strongest teams in the confers
ence. according to Fell. Last week
they defeated Beloit, the present
Midwest conference champions.
in a dual rireet.

This year's conference meet
will be held next week at Mt
Vernon. The Pioneer team also
has meets scheduled with Beloit
and Iowa State Teachers college
on the two following weekends.

The squad has been strength-
ened this week by the presence
of Bob Stewart. a letter-man from
last year's squad. who is again
out for practice. The four-man
team to race this Saturday will
be picked from Stewart, Fell.
Bill Gcooing. Dave Matlack. Jim
Miles and Ed Wczesny.

In the season's opener last
week against Drake. the Cilnnell
Squad suffered a defeat Fell fin-
ished sixth to top the Pioneer
runners Drake ranked fifth iii
the nation in collegiate cross
country last ,ear. and appearsto
have an even better aggregation

Greetings To

By kickoff time every Saturday.
Ted Husing. CBS football ari-
nouncer, knows that Tom Jellies,
lefl. half, rubs his hands befole
getting the pass from center.
That enables Husing and his as-
sistant. Jimmy Dawn. to spot
complicated spinners and sneak
plays He also watches John
Smith. the right end sirritlr ale
ways glances nervously at the
stands when his number is called
to receive a long for-ward pass

Husmg's method is simple.
First he selects the most promise
ing football game of the coming
Saulrda} Several days before the
game. he travels to the ironic
town. He haunts the practice
fields. carefully watching players
and coaches on each team. He
visits fraternity houses and col-
lege liangouts Ted even inter-
star naltbacks. the
waterboys. and the head coaches.
The night before the game, he
assembles all of the data on in-
dex cards like a college man px'ee
paring a term paper Then he's
ready,

Husing has literally stream-
lined football broadcasting. To
combine accuracy and speed inhis
ieportirrg. he invented a gadget
called air anlilmclator. It cost CBS
5800 to build Only Husing and
assistant. Jimmy Dolan. can fig-
ure out its complicated piish but
tons and flashing bulbs.‘ The
lights indicate the players; the

views the

buttons are used to manipulate
the lights so that Ted can visual»
me each play and report that
play to the radio audience. Dolan
watches the game through port»
ci-firl fieid glasses. and he relates
all substitutions and details to
his partner Ted finger-s the ans
nanciotor- and describes in older-
l_v form the chaos wlnoh sun
rounds a football game.

College studens like Hiising

lost every game that Ted harr-
dled. Then he picked a breather-
and the Buckeyes nosed out then-
opponents. But the very next
year. the boys from Columbus
embarrassed Husing again by
losing a major game to a Big
Ten rival.
