strong team and their deteat comes as
a pig surprise.

ceptionally wild, allowing seven wallss
in the tour innings that lie pitched.
Dihhle Hall took advantage or this
wildness in the ﬁrst inning when
Gelviii. ilark, and McLzllll, were given

man up, knocked one down to Wing.
who threw Gelvill out at the plate.
Fullerton walked torcing in the iii-st
run on a tielders choice and error by
lilcClaiii two men came home. Clark
mill was unalile to do anything in the
iii-st three trames, put in the fourth;
errors ehnhled McClain and Eunnell
to get on and also Evahll and Davis,
who collected the ﬁrst hingles of the
game. This rally which netted iour
runs apparently made things look rosy
for Clark. but Dibble tied the score
in their hair when lamp walked. stole
