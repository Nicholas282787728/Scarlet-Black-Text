That illusiie something uhicli we call the “Crrinnell
Spirit" does not e ist about the campus. in the recitation
halls, or in any group oi individuals. Rather the spin’t
and all that it tvpifies to a man of C innell college exists
in the tiorniito It is in the dormitory that the Griunell
man differs from any other college student. Academic
training may be secured at any one of the iitty or s . ty
Iowa schools that may be as good as that or Crriuncll, but
the 'Gl'inl‘iell Spirit" may be obtained troin only one
source. and that is the life in one of the men's halls,

For the life in a dormitory means coniinun , 01
interest, and itistliis community oiimerest idea that has
responsible for the abolition of the literary societies in
1925, and it is responsible for the temporary suspension
of student government. We cannot feel that our present
situation is a disgrace It is true that some of the in»
cidents leading up to the event were unsavo and we
would that they hat‘. never h. onev: Hon-ever, iii the
same manner that the centrali dtiou of men's life in the
dormitory system in 1917 affected the literary societies
which had always been the community of interest and the
outlet tor the social antl‘lrllollectllal impulses ot Grinneil
men for almost seventyetive years, the eyolution of dor-
mitory iii'e has caused the Student Court to outlive its
usefulness in the same manner as the literary societies
which voluntarily disbanded in 1925. the Court voluntar-

There can he no doubt that higher education in the
United states is entering into a new and pron . ug era.
an era of sell-appraisal. The many evperimon nou- liar
ing tested in colleges and universities. and par enlarly
in Grinnell prove the general evisientc oi this condi—
tion. It is true that [lie aim or these experiments are
rliiterent. but their very e ence indicate one point or
agreement.

1n the present situation on our campus. time is an
important element Have we had a suiticieiit length or
time to really investigate the Whole problem of student
gm‘elllmclit and sltlsly our own minds as to its place on
our campus? We have had time in point of hours But
time in point or thinking has not been available. Our
athletic tin-rotor as diagnosed the situation urth voumrre
able accuracy. \vncn tune was hanging heavily on the
llnllds ot a certain group ot athletes who u-ere returning

or absolute. inditrerence u s the only response In his eie
fort This u- 5 probably due to [lie necessity or their
thinking at a hundred other things at that moment that
prohibited their thinking seriously at the government
under irhich they lived.

We do not mean to cast reflections on this group or
men as indivrduals, but we do think that their attitude is
typical or students as a whole, They do not lake time to
tllilil: oi any one problem. There are a hundred scattered
thoughts on as many scattered interests that would seem
to emphasize Dr, Gilkey's remark, “We are going no-
where at the rate oi sixty miles an hour."
