Getting Off

As nummn arrives and the corn harvest draws to a
close, mnny of this year's sophomores nndjuniars already
have wellrlaid plans to leave thc dormitorics bchirrd next
year and make what is often their ﬁrst foray into real
world tenancy.

in order to 1ch ofrcnmpus, students niust accomplish
two things: be granted permission to leave by Giinncll
and attain a lease contract with a local landlord. Simply
having a contract is no gunmntcc that the school will allow
om: to move oﬂ‘campus, and being granted permission to
leave the student waives a student's guaranteed housing
and could prove disastrous ifthc student fails to reach an
ngreeinentwirli a landlord.

According to Dean for Student Life Jcn Krohn,
sometime in late February Student Affairs will givc
notice that the college is accepting applications to live
oii campus. Current sophomorcs and juniors who wish
to move oircnmpus next year must go to the ofﬁce of
Student Affairs and sign up individually by this yeni’s
March 14thtdcndlrnc.

.Krolin emphasized that deadline, saying that in nearly
all cases where incoming seniors are not allowed to move
off campus, thc issuc \WS punctuality

Once applications are in, “We linc people up by their
[room draw] numbers and usually we get through the
seniors for students who sign up by that dnte,"l<rohn said.
“alien we work our way through the juniors."

This ﬁrst group of students will be notified in late
April'll-los: not approved will be put on a waiting list.
Last spring, about 150 juniors and seniors were initially
allowed off campus. Krohn recalls that over the sum-
mer a few more groups of about 10 students were also
approved. The exact number of approvals is contingent
upon the number ofstudcnts returning
to Griimell in addition to the estimatcd
size of the ﬁrsrrycar class.

The glaring incongruiry of this
system is that smdcnts are often forced
to sign a lease contract six or seven

conﬂicts are law, they are very much a
possibility.

Liz Ward '07, who hopes to niovc
into thc Brande apartment complex
at the intersection of Park Street and
Fourth Avenue nextycar, already hns her roommate lined
up and lease contract signcd. Dcsplw the school’s advicc
that students wait until thcy are approved to live off
campus before signing lcasc contracts,Ward snid thnt for
popular areas like rhc Brande or High Street,“Autumn of

Allen Latcham, landlord of the Brande, conﬁrmed
that, ”n couple units are already rcnrcd for next year. All

Apartment or House

Apart from the nagging uncertainty built into the
process, once the search for oﬂrcampus housing begins
there are numcrous potential pitfalls. A good starting
point for students who want to live oft—campus is to
decide between living in a house or an apartment.

High Street and Broad Strcct arc home to some of

Grinncll’s more infamous party houses.
An important consideration for all
future party hosts is that in a house,
the neighbors arc not in the next room,
but are physically separated. That ad-
ditioiral dcgrcc ofscparation frequently
is the determining factor for noise
complaints from tlic iiciglibors, For a
quieter experience, studcnis ofrcn seck
Jen Krohn, out Park strcct, which oifcrs colorful
horiscs that are directly across rhc strcct
from school.

For many, rhc nppcnl ofhnuscs lies
in its common spaces. Whilc apartments almost always
include n kitchcn and often a living room, houscs might
offer a dining room, a basement and n porch. Carly Scs
huna'06,who lives in a Park Street house, said,“'Ihc bcst
part for nae is having a kitchen."

With more space come more responsibilities. Cur—
rently, Schuna and hcr houscmatcs are embroiled in a
dispute with their landlord about a technicality in their
lease contract regarding yard maintenance (theirlandlord,
Dan Hucbncr was unable to be reached for comment).

While Schuna said that they haven‘t had any “big

problems,"srudcnts who would rather not have a bac
yard to think about or a porch to ﬁx might want

consider renting an apartment.

Grinnell’s two most sought-after apartment co
plexes are arguably the Brande and the above the pi
apartments. Both house mosLly students and have un

of about ﬁve rooms.

In some cascs thcrc is only n minimal tradeoﬁ" b
tween apartments and houses when it comes to soc
lifc. Chris ForsterrSmirh '06, a resident of the abo
The Pub apartments and host of many an impromp

dance party, said, “Our speciﬁc apnrt—

mom has historically been sort ofa

party location, a bachelor pad kind of

apartmcnt."

Whilc police linvc responded to
noise complaints at his location, they
have not resulted in arrests or cita-
tions, possibly, he said, because until
recently Main Street was closed duc
to construction.

major price differences; the students interviewed for t1

room in a High Street housc, to $240 /pcrson/montlr
the Brande. In between were $205 for above The P

and $230 for Park Slrcct.

Thc utility bill must also be budgctced in, which
