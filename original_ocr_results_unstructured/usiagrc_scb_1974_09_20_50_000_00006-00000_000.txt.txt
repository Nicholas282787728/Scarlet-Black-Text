I' Mezvinsky,,& Leach: the issues

by Matt Coheii

Mezvinsky and Leach—Issues
and answers?) on the Campaign
Trail,

Benjamin Franklin once wrote.
“Words may show a man's wit, but
actions his meaning.” Despite all
of the rhetoric in the Congressional
campaign here in the First
District, the issues presented by
Democratic candidate
congressman Ed Mezvinsky
and Republican candidate Jim
Leach seem to center around two
things. These are Mezvinsky's

ri l uy. Scpt. 2U, 1517-!

Voting record and the means that
each is iinaiicing his campaign
The issues presented force one to
draw conclusions about which way
each candidate would lean iii a
given decision-making situation.
without an explicit distinction
necessarily being drawn by the
candidates.

Both candidates identified in-
llation as the issue oi greatest
importance to the average voter,
Leach accused Mezvlnsky of
supporting legislation which would
cause inflation. At the same time,
Leach suggested that the US.
government obtains 30 billion
dollars a year in additional
revenue because of inﬂation. He
suggested that this, coupled with
defense cuts, could be utilized to
maintain social services programs
which needed funding. Both
Mezvinsky and Leach agreed that
some money could be trimmed
irom the defense budget. in fact,
they both supported limiting
research on such programs as the
B-1 Bomber and cutbacks in
military troop strength in Europe.

replied with these proposals: 1)
Both lava 'd trimming the budget
whercveri '5 fat, and particularly
making some reduction in
the deieiise budget: 2) Both men
favored ztctive antitrust action on
the part at the Justice Depart
merit. a) both advocated corporate
tax reform, to close some of tlie
loopholes and make the tax
System more equitable; and 4|
both expressed disapproval oi the
notion of a reinstatement of wage
and price controls. They asserted
that these controls had failed under
the Nixon administration. and
therefore should be used only as a
last resort in the present situation.
The only area in which they dii—
iered drastically was in the area or
interest rates, Mezvinsky favored
immediate lowering of interest
rates, while Leach advocated a
curtailing of government in-
terference in the borrowing
market, He suggested that the
government’s issuing or bonds at
the 9 per cent rate was making it
impossible for private Savings and
Loans to attract dollars tor loaning
at competitive rates. He also
asserted that in an even-keeled
economy the government would
gel. an additional thirty billion
dollars in tax revenues each year
as a result oi graduated income
tax, which would yield more
because of inﬂation. He argued
that these revenues could be
utilized to meet needs while
“holding government spending
within reasonable limits.” Leach
also spoke of support oi vetoes of
some social weliare programs
which he considered inflationary.
CampaigliFinaiieing

The issue oi campaign iinancing
apparently was important. Leach
accused Mezvinsky of receiving
contributions irom special in-
terests, particularly out of state
interests, He charged that Mezc
vinsky had not yet disclosed the
sources for 35,000 dollars in
campaign contributions irom the
1972 campaign

Mezvinsky defended his receipt
oi these iunds by pointing out that
while the funds may have come

lrom out at the slate. ihcy were
donated by workers Within the
state. He cited the example of the
donation from the National
Education Association, Whose
political arms are located in
Chicago and Washington. pointing
out that While the check originated
ii-om these locations, it only oc-
curred because of the endorsement
by local teachers oi Mezvinsky He
stated further that lhese local
teachers contributed to the
national fund. and thus the
donation could be Viewed as really
coming [mm the teachers them-
selves. He pointed out that all the
funds that he received were ab-
solutely legal, and indicated that
this was in contrast to the secret,
corporate iunds, donated to certain
other campaigns.

He then charged that as of the
last reporting period, (that is the
one before the interview, rather
than beioi-e publication) about as
per cent oi Leaeh's campaign
funds had come out of his own
pocket. In response to the issue ol
out at state donations, he pointed
out that he had received nine times
as many in-state contributors as
did Leach,

When presented with Mez-
vinsky’s charges, Leach countered
initially by correcting Mezvinsky's
figures. He said that he had cons
tributed 50 per cent oi his earns
paign funds, not as per cent. He
then went on to attack Mezvinsky
ior loaning iunds to his campaign
in 1972, rather than contributing
them, He asserted that Mezvinsky
was in part repaid alter the
election by subsequent con-
tributions to his campaign.

Ford Thrown out ofWedlnck

Related to this issue of honesty in
campaigns and government is the
issue oi Watergate, Both can
didates expressed reactions to
President Ford‘s pardon oi
Richard Nixon.

Leach ielt that the country
should be sympathetic towards the
former Presidnet and stated that
he was not at all vindicative
towards Nixon. He did express
concern over the timilig oi the

pardon. He said that he won have

preferred to have seen the judicial
proceedings carried out to their
lengths and then, based on them,
[or the President to exercise his
judgement on a pardon.

Mezvinsky felt that the pardon
was inconsistent with Ford’s ex-
pressed desire for the judicial
process to run its course. Nixon's
pardon aborted the impeachment
process, but the pardon aborts th
court's pursuit of the truth, Mez- '
vinsky argued. He stated,
“Everyone believes that justice
should be tempered with mercy,
but hiding from the truth is not
justice. and providing a pardon
before the charges are resolved
really keeps us from knowing how
much mercy has been shown.”

Both candidates speculated on
the eitect that the pardon would
have on the nation, Leach
suggested that the parda
reopened the question o ,
Watergate and might have a
deleterious eiteet upon Republican
campaigns. Mezvinsky spoke to
this issue as well, stating, “Con-
trary to closing the book on
Watergate, the pardon condemns
the nation to a history of
speculation that may prove to be
far more devisive.”

Mezvinsky also commented upon
the effect that the pardon would
have on Ford 5 relations with
Congress He suggested that thes
relations were potentially very
good, but that the pardon had
destroyed the “honeymoon,”
“Ford was basically honest, the
one quality lacking in the Nixon
administration." Mezvinsky
stated. He went on to say that this
distinction had been weakened
because of Ford 5 loss of
