“HELP “ ANTED"

The purpose of an editorial column is to feed the
mind of its readers with vital, useful, interesting stimu»
lants to thinking. If it fails in that. it becomes the
most useless member of the newspaper. Critical reading
of editorials is the best mews of keeping the column
Without a knowledge of how you react to what
we say, it is hard for us to know what to do the next
time.

One writer for exapmle, has recently argued [or a.

If you don't agree with him, let the “Scarlet and Black”
know about it. Perhaps you think We stress culture too
much already, and that the editorial Writer who has
written about that is off on the Wrong track again. Again,
is this stuff about “IVorils” entirely bunk?

The “What Do You Thin .. column should be a com—
panion one to the editorial column. What one says

"Black Laughter" Sherwood Anderson writes about a

Courses in speech and composition are serious and
valuable courses. Their practical application is as ulllr

of their importance or of our unusual opportunity as
