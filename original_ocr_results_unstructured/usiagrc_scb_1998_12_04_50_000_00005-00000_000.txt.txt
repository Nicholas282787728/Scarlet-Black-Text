Also, they had to find

because ofthe continuing

The SuccerrﬁtlUﬂ tfnm

By Maria Irene Farncs

Directed by c. Josephine Hagcrry '00

Directed by Rachel Edwards Harvith '00

Students accomplished
everything else. “It is

. a chance to do
something completely
on your own,” said
Gepner.‘

The one acts pro-
vide an opportunity for
students to learn about
themselves as artists
and people. They help
students explore what
areas of theatre they
might want to pursue.
In addition participat»
ing in the one acts
teaches students skills
for group work, orga—
nization, and time»
management.

The festival is the
product ofmuch time
and hard work. The
plays, while usually very good, are still works
in progress. “The energy and drive which you
put into it largely reﬂects the final result," said
Gepner. ,

There are no tickets so students hoping for
good seats should arrive early.

Reviews

By ZORKA MILIN

 

As much as possible, I try to write about
films that I like and that I deem worthy of
your attention. Not only does that work bet—
ter for me (naturally it does) _ Id like to think
it was better for the reader too; you got spared
of all the rant and whining and negative en.
ergy erc._ This week, however, I’m forced to
write about two films rhatI actually had a hard
time ﬁnding good things to say about. No big
deal; we’ve got waltz, so who needs movies

anyway — tight?

Eat Drink Man “7477/1171 by Ang Lee

The video jacket said it was all about
the link between food and love, or maybe
something how one was a symbol for the omer,
so this made me tamer curious — and Wouldn’t
you be? But I forgot how me capitalist sharks
of the video industry always make it sound bct-
tcr than it really is. It turns out I was way nit
to think along the lines ofgasrronomicsensu-
ality _ as in Lila: Warm FM Chico/arc, which,
by the way, is easily one ofmy airtime favor-
itc movies. Ear Erin/e Mrm Min/m is by Ang
Lee, a Taiwanese director who later directed
If! 5mm (shown here last year _ and what an
amazing improvement it is; also swtthtYMf-
tee is hopefully coming next semester). The plot
ofthe movie concerns the finest culinary inas-
ter in the city ofTaipci and his mree daugh-
ters. The opening scene is the best, showing
elaborate steps involved in die art of prepare
ing a rich traditional meal. Unfortunately, the
film doesn’t live up to its intriguing title, and
fails to deliver after this promising start. Un»
developed characters, weak acting and very
slow overall pace make it boring to watch, for
everyone except, perhaps, the most devoted
fans ofOtiental cuisine.

The sprint-sh protest" by David Mamet

Again I felt cheated by thc title. It and the
music led me to expect somethingentitely dif-
ferent. In reality, it’s just another one ofthosc
puzzle movies (that I rarely get very excited
about): how things are never what they stem,
and how you should never trust anyone and
all that stuff, For one thing, this type ofmovie
is not only utterly generic and predictable, but
also totally unbelievable and contrived, since
anemic characters make it hard for actors to
be the least bit convincing. For instance, the
hcro in question (Joe something or other) is
supposedly some kind ofa scientific genius —
but turns out to be the dumbest guy in the
whole movie, Oh, and that female lead
(Mamct's wife in real life), She just about kills
the whole thing, making it almost unbearable
to Watch, Afterwards, someone told me it was
an independent ﬁlm, and I had no idea. In all
aspects, this is your average Hollywood block.
buster, and in fact maybe i hit phonier than
the average.
