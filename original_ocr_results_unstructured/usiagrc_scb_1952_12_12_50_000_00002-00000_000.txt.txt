Pleasures, Benefits of Grinnell

by Connee Clemens

As you go through the excitement or next u-eek's‘activilies

. here‘s something for you to take

a moment to think abou Tlli

years after you graduate from Grinnell—what will be vour feel

lugs and impressions toward the
mosl about this Christmas season
life? .
After approximately 30 years

school7u'haf will you remenlbel“

and other events in your college

away from Grinnell, James Nor

man Hall, 1910 graduate and author and composer of “Sons of Old
Grinnell,” wrote in 1944 a delightful autobiography entitled “M,
Island Home", in which he vividly relates some of his impressions

and memories of his four years

My Island Home" takes you’

back to the time when the tui-
tion Was $65 and room l'Ent

professors were even tougher
graders than they are now; Mr.
Hall flunked trigonometry and
had to attend summer school:
Those were the days when
students had rooms the
townpeople's homes.

0n the whole, much or the
campus life from 1906 to 19-10
was the same as it is today,
student reception committees
met new- incoming students
at the train station. The glee
club had its Marching Song
and made concert tours in
the spring. The library stacks

were nvnilnble us a privi-
lege and a service to students.
chpcrs was theJnvorite re~
ligions service on cnmpus.
And, come commencement
time, most seniors would
rather not have graduated.

In his memoir Mr. Hall nai-
rates his dreams and Expel‘~
iences as a Young boy from
Mltchellvllle, as he matures,

works his way through school
and finally discovers an is
land solitude in the south seas
where he settles down to write,
The book is presently appeare
ing in abridged form in the At-
lantic magazine and the Dcs
Moines Sunday Register. ,

Mr Hall liked Grinnell from
the first day. In fact, he had?
made several l ps, “gratis" the,
Rock Island rt pad and uh;
known to his parents, to see
the Grinnell campus before hcl
came as distudent. However.
he came to Grinnell practical
ly broke and against his par-
ents Wishes.

He Worked as a waiter,
raked leaves, and peeled pota-
tees to pay for his schooling;
He sang in the glee Club. He
found “new authors" while
browsing- in the library. I-le
benefited from the student or
ganizations, both social and;
scholastic. And, he appreciated
and gained from his friendly
relationships with an outstand-
ing faculty.

As Mr. nnll puts it, “Look—
iilg hack to those days I now
see how large a part of bene-
fifs I received lrom college
came iud ectly."

He benefited from College di-
rectly, too. When he left Gl‘In-‘
nell as a philosophy and Engel
lish literature inninr, Mr. Hull
took a great. deal with hiln.‘
His professors realized this
fact for he quotes the follow-l
lng statement he overheard one,
of his professors make about
his scholastic

in

abilities. l
“He’s another example of the,

at Grinnell college.

exasperating type of Student;
ltheV seem to have ability

,any other way. You hope it
lwill cvystnlll e so that you can
see what it is composed of, but
it remeins in solution."

Mr. Hall made up his trigo-
nometry failure at the summer
schoolbf the University of Chi—
cago. Here he was introduced
to the large school.

Although he admitted that
his view was “that of n coune
try yonfh without humnn
connections there," he ton'ned
n very definite opinion of the
institution. He said; “It was
far too large. an educational
factory rnther than n univer-
sity in the fine sense."

In a sense he wasn't cone
clemning any other type of cd
lucational system, he was incl 7
ly “sold” completely on Grin~
ncll and the kind of institution
it is as far as fulfilling
-neads was concerned.

l When you finish the section
of “My Island Home" which
relates his life zit Grinnell, you
slncerclv (eel that James Nore
man Hall meant every word
when he wrote the memorable
:hnzas of “Sons of Old Grin-
nell."

Sons 0! old Grinnell.

Let your voices swell,

In a song to the staunch, the
true.

In pl‘ai‘c of Alma Mater,

As her sons ever love to do,

Thy glory and Thy honor,

Thy fume alone-we tell,

And over [or Tllcp.

Our love shall be,

Grinnell . Grinnell . Grinnell.

We will cheer for Thee

In each mun ;

We will love Thee in defeat;

With the same old loyal
spirit,

Whate'ei' the year may bring
Thee,

The name we lovc so well,

We pledge it shall ne'er

Dishonor bear,

Grinnell , Grinnell 7 Grinnell.

With n zeal to do

We will follow true,

In the years that are yet to
be;

Thy love of truth shall guide

Through success or ndve

Let every son uncover,

To her whom c love so well,

That namelw tten high,

Shall never die.

that they contact Billy Graham.
