O Stowe Speaks

We are convinced of two things following
Leland Stowe’s lecture Friday night. One is
that Mr. Stowe‘s engaging personality has
led him into some amazing adventures; cer-
tainly he has been Grinnell's most enter-
taining speaker in a long while, The other
' is that we question some of the conclusions
that he tossed in at the end of his travel—
ogue. In the main we are not as fatalisticr
ally convinced that U. S entrance into the
war is inevitable or even necessary,

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

To escape the accusation that we are ig»
noring facts, certain statements must be
made. It is a conceded point that should
American aid fail to matelialize, England
could not survive against the invaders, With
England’s scalp at her belt, Germany’s pow-
er and prestige in the international scene
would be boundless In that case, as Mri

Stowe brought out, the democratic United

States would turn into a bristling military
camp and free government would probably
disappear.

It is also lamelitably true that the United
States is very close to actual military par—
ticipation in World War II. Despite the
filibustering of certain “isolationists” in the
Senate, the Lease-Lend bill is sure to pass
within the next ten days#a bill which
clearly will associate the United States more
intimately with the European scene And
the ties of language, culture, and civilization
that bind the United States to England may
drag us into the war proper,

Grant the truth of all these statements!
what is the alternative? The American peo-
ple are renowned for two paradoxical traits
of national character—we are “hard-headed"
pragmatists and at the same time easily
aroused “sentimentalists”. Mr. Stowe’s con-
cluding remarks were evidently addressed
to appeal to the latter characteristic of his
audience In addition to the justified criti-
cism that his conclusions had little connec
tion with the main body of his speech, then
it can be stated with equal justice that they
were based on personal obsewations arising
from emotional biases.

Just perhaps our entrance into the war is
the wisest course in the long run But isn‘t
it only right and fair to be able to say to
future generations that we plotted our
course after judicious and rational conside‘
ation? The less we hear from so—called e.
perts speaking from emotional bias the
better. ‘

“Countries are not unities as We

series of eight contemporary his-
tory lectures in Herrick chapel
last night.

Dr. Slmans stated that when
people migrate into countries
which have better economic pros—
pccis, they bring their own ideals
and beliefs. He believes that the
underlying conflict is racial preju-

To the Editor:

We feel that the sophisticated at-
titude of Grinnell students is be-
coming u means of showing their
ignorance rather than their in-
telligence, When a mun with as
fine is reputation as Leland Stowe
is called a “propagandist,” we
feel that they are overstepping
their sophistication a bitloc much.
Anyone who tries to convince is
a propagandist, but that is not
the meaning that most Grinneli
students have had in mind.

Leland Stowe is one or the best
informed about the Dimpcan win-s

not is man given to sensational-
ism; we have met nun hillrcd

After this when a wellrkliowll

might be wiser and in better
taste to withold criticism until
said criticism can be proved,

Juliette Barker to Read
‘Tllare Shall Be No Nighl'

Juliette Barker. dramatic reader,
will present the play, “There Shall
Be No Night," Sunday at 7:30
p. m. in the quadrangle draw-
ing room, Phyllis Rutledge, quads
rangle social chairman, announc—
ed today.

Miss Barker, who is being spon-
scrcd hy the Social Budget com<
mittee, was in Grinnell two years
ago when she read "Susan and
God.”

Joe Becker and his cohorts in the
drama department whipped up a
frothy little piece or delightful-
ncss Saturday and Monday nights
in the Alumni Recitation hall
auditorium when they presented
Gerald Savory's play, “George and
" Margaret,” apro‘
duction which
_ emphasized char-
. acterization and
ignored plot.
And despite the
fact that in the
final analysis the
show adds up to
a little bit of
nothing, almost
every mcmhcr of
the two au-
diences should
Joe Becker have left the
auditorium feeling they had sel-
dom spent a more happy-go-lucky
evening than the one spent in
the company of Mr. and Mis.
Malcolm Gai'thrBandcr and fain-
ily For “George and Margaret”
is a catchrusscatch-can play that
dangles around a semblance of a
plot based on two love affairs and
a. mysterious couplc who never
come to dinner. Enough said
about the story, for it serves as
nothing more than a weak and
rather poor cxcusc to hold the
characters or the play together.
Giving 'cdit where credit is
due, the directing was good be-
cause the acting was good and
the entire production was neatly
handled. Freshman Kenneth Semi
in the role of gray, old Malcolm
Garth-Bantler, a heavy-sci, ab—
sentrmindcd, and very human hus-
band and father, steals the show,
But, not to take credit away from
other mcmhcrs of the cast, Sam
was possessed with a part which.
if wellrhanded, would create a
character everybody would love.
James Gardner who played
Dudley. the sceptical and sar»
castic son or the family, also

 

 

 

 

turned out an excellent piece of
acting. His witty and biting re-
marks did much to sell the play
to line collegiate spectators Alice
Garih-Bnnder, wire or Malcolm,
wns ably pomcycd by Alice
Meyer in a part in which it was
difficult to win the sympathy of
the audience. Helen Bayuk's
Frankie, the daughter of the
family, was also well. handled as
were the roles of Claude, the
staid older son, played by Thomas
cnrmody, and Roger, the youth-
lul house guest, portrayed by
John Ganscrt. And then Betty
Ann Wilson’s characterization of
Gladys, the parlor maid, was good.
The final orchid should be pin-
ned oh Elainc Hummel for the
ninety seconds she appeared on
the siagc RS hangover—reminding
Beer, the llew maid.

"George and Margaret" unlikc
“You Can't Take It With You”
left the audience with nothing to
think about. In viewing the latter
play, onc bcgins to wonder why
pcoplc work so hard to become
successful, In "Geolge and Marg-
aret" you incicly leave the
theater with no thoughts whatso-
ever on your mind

Essentially, and this is no re-
flcction on the cost or producer,
the play was like eating toasted
marshmallowsidcllghtful and fun
{or the first few mouthfuls, but
awfully sickening for a steady
diet. The show was good for col~
lcge consumption, but to make it
a persistent ideal for any stage
would be disastrous
