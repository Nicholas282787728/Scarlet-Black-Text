Cowles:
Diversity
and
Dinner

by Karin Sedeslrom

Cowles? Cowles’l Isn’t that the dining
hall?

Well. guess what'.’ People DO live in
Cowles, or above ii, rather, and the ones I
lalked to claim that people tend to lorget
about them Liz Schwartz claims that ”No
one ever comes to visit us because they

, iorget about us, they associate Cowles
with dinner."

Hmmm “It's far from a lot of things,"
admits Cathy Burr, the SA on third, “like
the library. the Forum, South Campus in
general," ,

Walt. Junker likes Cowles because “you
can walk down to breaklast in your jam»
mies And when you go down lor dinner
you never have to worry about your coat
getting stolen.”

(That‘s what I'd look for in a dorm, per-
sonally,)

Most of these comments were made by
whoever was sitting around in the West
Third suite at the time I waltzed in with my
trusty pen and notebook. Alter a while it
got rather coniusing remembering who
said what andhow it was worded. i did my
best. people, really.

Cathy said her dorm is “incredibly laid
back.” when pressed to “describe your
dorm in 20 Words or less.”

Amy Naugton. a cowles Second resir
dent who happend to be around the
suite at the time. said firmly that “Cowles
isn't as bad as people think it is.” Ah. but
how bad do people think it is? The eternal
burning question

“you can walk down to
breakfast in your
jammies,”...

“the width of the halls
are perfect for wall
walking. ”

Cathy. as the SA, also had this to say:
“Cowles is stereotyped as a really bad
dnrm. During SA room draw, people with
low numbers were taking Norris beiore
they took Cowles; nobody wanted to get in-
to Cowles,"

“The width oi the halls is periect ior wall
walking," says John Ekey, Cowles'
answer to Splderman. speaking up ior his
dorm's better qualities.

Walt kindly inlorined me here that
“Everyone thought John lived in the closet
lor a long time because someone took his
sign oil his door and put it on the cleaning
closet door. He’d get phone calls, and peo-
ple would knock on the closet door and go

Way Out in London

Handling parents vacationing in London

by Shelley Reid

An interesting thing oiten happens when
you come to London for a semester: your
family, regardless of how vehemently they
have sworn that life in Fodunk, USA, was
everything they needed. suddenly gets an
incurable wanderlust So they decide to go
7 where else? e to London

There is no way to avoid this, If you
write and say how much you love London,
they will be on the first plane out of
Podunk. ll you write and say how
miserable life in London ls, they will either
want to console you in person, or will ieel
that you just need someone to show you
how to really enjoy London. li you never
write at all, they will get increasingly
curious, and ﬁnally come over just to see
what you are hiding irom them.

Equally, there is no way to prepare lor
them. When you ask them in July if they
are considering going to London, they will
shake their heads and give a dozen reasons
why they cannot, or will not, go. in
September, however, the story can be
quite dilierent.

There are a few nice things about having
one or more iamily members, especially
parents, visit you in London. Sometimes,
for example, they are willing to pack a tow
items of distinctly American origin of
which you have been unmerciiully depriv—
ed: Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Doritos
Nacho Cheese Flavor Tortilla Chips, or
perhaps the updates lor All My Children.

Visiting relatives also provide a ready
excuse to do the touristy things you might

 

not otherwise get around to doing: wander
through Harrod’s and get hopelessly lost.
watch the guards not changing at Bucks
ingham Palace, snap a dozen pictures of
Big Ben, and by tacky postcards oiCharles
and Di to Send to the relatives who didn't
get to come. Best 01' all, though, is that
longawaited oiier to take you Out To
Dinner at a Real Restaurant. For a meal

I assure you that it is
virtually impossible to

mother is sitting across
the main Not Bothering
you.

that doesn’t require you to pay, cook, or
Wash dishes, you can endurc’a lot of tacky
postcard buying.

ll you are feeling brave. the next step is
to issue an invitation to spend some time at
your flat, or perhaps even to stay over
night, (It’s all right; your ilatmates will
eventually forgive you ) You will have to
clean up a bit iirst. however,

This helps avoid the comments like
“You still don't like to clean up your room.
do you?" (parents have indelible
memories about messy bedrooms.) You

can also have the wonderlul experience o
breezing through and apologizing “that the
place is such a mess,” just like your
parents always told their guests alter
they'd kept you home scrubbing
hascboards and picking the lint out of the
houseplants all day

In fact. the opportunities [or'role rever-
sal increase quite dramatically when your
parents actually visit your very own ilat. ll
they stay at a hotel, oi course. you can still
work with some basic parental
statements, such as “no, no, Mum..we‘re
going to take the tube line with the pretty
blooooo signs, not the red ones,” and
“Come along this way. Dad, we have to go
away now or we'll miss our train."

But there's really nothing quite as satis
lying as being able to turn to a parent and
say, with just the right amount oi con-
descending exasperutio “NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU'VE DONE: you let your wet
umbrella drip all over my kitchen floor."

(Note: these techniques should be used
in direct proportion to the parental sense
oi humor, and should only be applied
AFTER they have taken you Out To Dine
nei‘ J

Finally, a parental visit during the
Grinnellrlanondon semester can be a good
reminder oi why you chose to go AWAY to
college, My flatmate's mother, lor in-
stance, managed to arrange her stay in
our flat so that it coincided with our Phase
I finals week. (I Willi eventually, forgive

“A lot oi people here are into practical
jokes Once they popped popcorn ior about
three days straight and then taped a board

opened the door it all fell out on him. He
took it pretty well though." iWalt again.)

“Everyone writes notes and garbage on
Chris Heckman’s board.” someone said.

This is sprawl hall," Cathy said. “A lot
oi people do their homework either sitting
in the hall or in this suite,”

Walt lamented that “they told us we
can't go out on the loggia anymore because
it's a hazard; the bricks are getting old
and they're coming loose."

Liz and Lara Szent-Gyorgi came in, and
someone mentioned to me to "make sure
to say that Cowles is the home of Liz and
Lara, the giggle twins." iFar be it from
me, a lowly interviewer, to deny a request
like that)

When asked about the negative aspects
oi Cowles. Liz replied that “sometimes the
bathrooms smell like dinner.”

Someone else remarked that “a lot of
people here are learning to juggle; so it‘s
juggling hall too."

Walt told me that “we get pizzas almost
every night. Tell everyone to donate
money It) the Cowles Pizza Fund.”

“Yeah," John sa'd “Tell the S and B to
run more Pagliai 5 coupons. Like about
thirty or lorty per issue."

Scott Matthews. the RHA. had this to say
[or his dorm's activities 7 “We have
movies every Wednesday, and that is the
highlight ol my week."

Right before I left. Liz told me to make
sure to mention that “the quoteboards are
a lot of fun. and the comic board is really
good. even though no one‘s added anything
to it in '4 while,”

“Cowles is small but the people are
nice!" she called alter me.

At this point. Mrs. Knipper began
speaking again. “All right have you
figured it out” Here‘s my lis «too much
money at the wrong time. high interest
rates and dropping land values. competing
imports. higher larm prices, dwindling
foreign markets. low crop yields, and good
management on the part 0! the farmers!

“It‘s NOT the farmer's fault. We have to
bury the guilt and bury the blame."

”when God created us. he gave us two
ends. One for sitting on, and one (or think
ing with. Our happiness depends on which
end we use the most "

Mrs, Knipper ended on a positive note-e

“Don't look back. Remember to help
others. Stop trying to outrun the other per-
son and work together."

The end of the speech was heralded with
much applause
