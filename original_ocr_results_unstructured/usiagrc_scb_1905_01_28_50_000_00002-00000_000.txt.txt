UST uln there are college sLur
] dents who seem addicted to
lrleptomania with r 'erenoe to attrac-
tive advertising caids is something
or a mystery but the Week just clos-
ing has shown indications oi this Old
trait of our character. The advertis-
ini; committee i'or last night’s enter-
tainment and the manager or the
basket ball team have grievances to
report \\' icli it is hoped are not to be
re-experienced in the future through
other acts of vandalism such as re-
moving advertising cards from places
where they have been placed for the
instruction or the public. It adver-
tising pays at all it is nothing less
than an net or hostility to destroy or
remove it, be it, done thoiightlessly or
with malice aiore thought. Maha-
gers as a rule would rather give away
signs belore they are distributed than
after. You will confer a favor on
them usually‘by ing honestly ior
cards,
