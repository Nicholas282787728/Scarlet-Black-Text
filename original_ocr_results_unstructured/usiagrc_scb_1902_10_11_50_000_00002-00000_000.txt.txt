OR the last few years the
Unit has struggled thi-u an
existence that was more than once
threatened with an abrupt end. It
has seemed as if the college could
not support a literary paper. This
year an effort will be made to
make the Uni! such a magazine as
will enforce support. Several
improvements have been made in
the form and style and others will
follow while the editorial manage
ment will try to conﬁne the ma
terial to strictly ﬁrst class articles.
Grinnell has the men to run the
paper, and the talent to ﬁll it if
only enough interest can be
aroused. A generous and en
thusiastic interest would soon
make the Uﬂil a strong college
magazine worthy or ranking with
the best.

Lanmen last year a high jumper

were Ditts who is a speedy man

jumper, and Dickles. 1n the
spring the track team will be

CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS PREFER-
ENCES.

The Y. M. and Y. W. C. A
committees for taking the strident
census of denominational prefer
ences have been appointed and the
work will be carried on as rapidly
as possible. The plan will be
more difﬁcult this time on account
of the fact that the undertaking is
new in this college. The question
is simply the denomination to
which the student belongs, or that
which he prcfers. if not a church
member. Statistics of this nature
are taken in most large universi-
tics.
