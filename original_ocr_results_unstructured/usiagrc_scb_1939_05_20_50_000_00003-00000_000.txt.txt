Beta Sigma Fraternity Pushes O

Authorities
Deny Need

Brotherhood Adopts
Aggressive Policy,
Sincere Platform

College authorities today
were reported probing the
Alpha chapter of Iowa of Beta
Sigma, which is in the pro-
cess of being organized on
the Gl-innell campus. 4
The chapter of Ol‘gﬂana‘
tion was issued to the Gl‘ln-
nell band by national head-
quarters. The International
Brotherhood of Beta Sigma,
men’s national honorary

speech fraternity, is open
only to those men who have

shown a sincere effort to culti-
vate innuendo, onomatopoeio and
redundancy. ,

Beatty Commons.

While Shelton L. Beatty, dean
of men. declined to state deri-
nitely whether the faculty com-
mittee on organizations would
approve such a fraternity. if and
when it presents application, the
general opinion both among the
faculty and student body was
that there was “no need on the
Grinnell campus for an organi-
zation to foster 'ease and feli-
city in conversational speech!”

Beatty pointed out that while
Friars was organized to encourage
student leadership, and Phi Beta
Kappa to honor scholarship. Beta
sigma would be recognizing a
field of activity in which Grinnell
has never slipped.

George Sargent, instructor in
speech. who is rumored to be
under consideration by the group
for in faculty advisor, was re-
luctant to comment about the
plans. “I have no statement to
make.” he declared, "as I have
not as yet been approached by
any member of this honorary
group in regard to acting as its
sponsor."

Aggressive Policy.

Meanwhile, the committee ap-
pointed by the national head»
quarters of the Brotherhood an-
nounced that they intended to
pursue an aggressive policy in
establishing the chapter on this
campus.

Their next steps, according to
Robert Moehl, one of the tem—
porary vice—presidents, will he to
adopt an “intelligent and sincere
platform," and to “conduct for;
mal initiation of the new mem—
bers yet to be pledged.”
Declares Platform.

Although the committee was
hesitant about declaring its plat—
form, unimpeachable sources re
vealed that work was already
afoot to cooperate with the men's
orientation class in a new series
of group discussions, the main
purpose of which will he to ac-
quaint the neophytes with the
proper procedure in securing
“ease and felicity in conversa—
tional speech.”

The topic for the first dis—
cussion has tentatively been listed
as, "Resolved: that the Federal
government should return all land
west of the M. 8: St. L. tracks to
the indians."

Clark-Dibble
Feud Resumed;
Eagles Migrate

By Charles Edwards.

it was a lovely afternoon in the
dormitory system, quiet and
peacefulihll the Dibble men were
on a "picnic" at Westfield with
the girl friends. Two Dibble
eagles parked their flighty 300
pounds on their lower extremi-
ties snd preened their wings
restlessly. The quiet was deadly
—maddening. Slyly one turned
to the other, and winked her
good eye in a suggestive manner.
The other nodded in agreement.

Flattering their cast iron
wings daintily, the two birds
swooped gracefully from the
clubroom, down the corridor, and
into the loggia. Pausing only
long enough to wink at fourteen
Clark boys playing parchesi in
the house mother's suite, the two
faded away into the distance.

Upon the Dibble men’s return
they found that the hall mascots
had taken slight, At least they
were not in their usual places he-
side the fireplace.

For reasons unknown the Cone
sensus of opinion of the whole
hall was cast in the direction of
Clark. This may or may not
have been justified, that fact
remains unsolved. but at any rate
the Dibble abductors plotted and
schemed until about 3 a. m. Fri-
day, and then swung into action.

Action was headed toward the
room of a suspect in Clark. The
plot moved swiftly when the Dib-
ble men entered the room and at-
tempted to tie and tape the sus—
pect so that he would be more
easily swiped.

It wasn’t until they had the
captive well tied and ready for
delivery that he fully regained his
sense of values. or injustice. For
it was then that he yelled for
dear life and aroused several of
the lighter sleepers in the hall.
The alarm frightened the abduct-
ors, and as they made a hurried
exit our captive hero caught a
piece of one of the kidnappers
clothing. This slowed his parting

long enough for a flying taclde
on the part of a local boy to pro—
duce a new captive.

But the story is yet young.
The rise of the morning sun
found that two wheels from the
car of the Clark man had van.
ished in the night. The results of
the conflict found Clark accusing
Dibble for making a scooter out
of our hero’s car, Naughty
words, law suits, and conferences
followed during the course of the
day.

Dean Shelton 1.. Beatty refused
to become entangled in the fracas.
“At least, not until the house
councils of both halls have had a
chance to settle the thing peace—
ably," was the Dean’s statement.

Our Clark hall hero. when
asked his opinion, commented, “I
am absolutely a victim of circum-
stances. the eagles must have
been molting and decided to fly
north."
