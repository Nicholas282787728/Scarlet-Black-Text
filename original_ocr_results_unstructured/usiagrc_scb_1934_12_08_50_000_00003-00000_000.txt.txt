Christmas Play

by Clifton Lamb
Wins Recognition

Cliiton Lamb, '33, Grinnclls negro
actor.authoi-, is receiving wide re.
cognition as a playwright. His Christ.
mas play, “The Two ciits". was given
by Grinncll players for the biennial
meeting at the lowa Federatlon oi
Women's clubs in Mason City in May,
1933, and since then Sara Sherman
Pryor, head ot the drama department,
has received numerous inquiries iroin
lowa cluh women who are interested
in producing the play.

The NovembenDecember issue ot
the “iowa Club Woman" announced
that Mr. Lamb's play is now available,
and within the past week Mrs. Pryor
has received more than a dozen let»
tors in response.

Recently the play was produced by
Marion Schissel. '34, or connection
with her dramatic work in the El.
yira Consolidated schools. Her pro.
duction was rated a close second to
the winner oi a one act play contest in
which a number oi schools participat.
ed.

R. L. Sci-gel, head of the Dramatic
Publishing company oi Chicago, and

Barrett Clark, literary editor oi the
Samuel French Publishing company at
New York, have praised “Thu Two
Gifts" as an unusually wcll.wi~itteir
one—act play,

Mr. Lamb played a minor part in
the Broadway production at “Dance
with Your Coda" until the play closed
recently. He is now back at his home
in Muscatine.

In a letter to Mrs. Pryor, he writes;
“I don’t know whether i am glad oi-
sorry. I do know that i will never
ieel as much at home as 1 telt in New
York. Broadway is nol. prejudiced
against the Negro actor; it is willing
to give him a decent break The
trouble is that there are too tow good
Negro plays. 1 think, too the time
being, it is better ior me to conceii.
trate on my writing with the [cw
contacLs I have made, I am Confident
that it I can produce soniethuig worth.
while, I can hurt a producer"

here’s why_

We know that winking a- pzpe
is dzjfkrentfmm smoking 4 cigar or
cigarette . . . and in ﬂying to ﬁnd
the tobacco best suited for pipes . . .

We found out that the best tobacco
for use in a pipe grows down in the
Blue Grass Section of Kentucky, and it
is called White Burley.

There is a certain kind of this tobacco
that is between the tobacco used for ciga-
rettes and the kind that is used for chew-
ing tobacco.

This is the kind of tobacco that we use,
year after year, for Granger Rough Cut.

We got the right pipe tobacco, made
it by the right Process . . . Wellman’s
Process . . . we Cut it right . . . rough Cut.

The big Granger ﬂakes have to
