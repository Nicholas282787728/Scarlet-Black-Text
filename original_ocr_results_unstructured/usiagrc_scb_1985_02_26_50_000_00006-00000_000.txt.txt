Thle students of Grinnell College

viction, we call upon the college’s
Board of Trustees as well as our
representatives in the federal
government is to take active
measures to eliminate a artheid.

We believe that the U. , govern-
ment should refuse to consider ap-
plications for federal loans and
work contracts from those firms
that o erate in South Africa
withou comp plyeing with the
Sullivan Princ1p es In addition
we implore the U S. government
to avoid any military or strategic
cooperation with the South

Resolved,

The students of Grinnell College
op se both covert and overt U. S.
mi itary intervention in the af-

morally bankrupt an do not pro-
mote long- -term U S. interests.

In accordance with these
beliefs, we agree that:

1) no US troops should be sent
to Central America;

2) the US. should not provide
aid to the Nicaraguan “contras”;

3) the US, should regularize its
diplomatic relations with
Nicaragua and
