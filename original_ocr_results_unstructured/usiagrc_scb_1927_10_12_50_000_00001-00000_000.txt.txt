Missouri Valley football teams dis-
played much in the way of both good
and bad football in Saturday's games.
There was one tight struggle. and
several Walkaways.

The leading game on the calendar
was the Nebraska-Missouri encounter
which ended in a 7 to 6 victory for
Missouri. Missouri gives promise of
being one of the most powerful teams
in the country this year. Bert Clark.

that enabled Missouri in Win the game,
This has been a custom of Clark's for
the last three MlssnurirNe‘orasku
games. Nebraska seemed to lack their
usual fight, and, though they out-
pointcd the Cornhuskers, lacked the
punch at the crucial time.

Amos Beats Simpson.

Amcs beat Simpson in a non-coir
ference tilt, as did Washington thc
Rolla School of Mincs. Amos won 26

forced to display their iull strength at
any time. Washington, With a strong

Kansas Traiiiplcd 0n. -.

Kansas was hopelessly trampled on
by Wisconsin to the tune of 26 to 0. At
no time during the game did Kansas
threaten Wisconsin's goal line, and
their only touchdown came on a ninety
vai‘d run from a rccovcrcd fumble by
Cochran, substitutc halfback. Crcfoot

Scribe Suggests Spaghetti Eating
Contest to Honor Genoese Sailor

The most national of all national
holidays has arrived. It was 435
years ago on October 12, that Mr. C.
Columbus hopped off in his scargoing
vehicle from the harbor at Cherbourg
for was it Marseilles?7fmd trailed
across the pond to America. (At least
we like to think it was America, but
Californians would like us to believe
it was California.)

New, over four centuries after his
arrival, the least We can do is to 09187
brdtc the anniversary in some fitting
manner. Among the novel suggestions
lol- such a fcte. the most original is s.
spaghetti-eating contcst to honor the
Scheme sailor. In fact. it was said
that this is the plan of hilarity adopt-
ed by the city of Des Molnes. (More
new: for the "Amcricana.") Wouldn't
Columbus be proud to know how
greatly he was helping out the home
industry!

The great discoverer has contrib-
uted more to our daily life than we
suspect. Consider the many replicas
of the good old SANT AMARIA that
adorn even the most polished drawing:

 

rooms of American society. Think of
thc baii‘rsplitting tales of the mutiny
aboard the NINA which would never
have graced our shelves of ﬁction. to
say nothing of the poetic monuments
to thc “brave adm’r’l.”

The only defect with this whole at?
fair of idolizing Columbus is that
there is no particularly ethical charac-
teristic in the man which would bear
rcpctition to our progeny through
anecdotes. No mol‘zll prcnx has ever
been afﬁxed to Culumubus' name, such
as "truthful George" or “honest Abe."
What a pity that he could not have
cut down a cbcrry orchard, or walked
20 miles to return a postage stamp!
Had only some one callcd bim“uprigbt
Chris," he might havc been more of
a national hero.

At any rate, Columbus Day is at last
coming to its own along side of Huh
luwe'en, Labor Day, and April ﬁrst,
in the past, Discovery Day has bcen
ratbcr neglcctcd, but let us hope that
it has been carefully observed this
year. and that in the future, equally
impressive celebrations will be con-
ceived,
