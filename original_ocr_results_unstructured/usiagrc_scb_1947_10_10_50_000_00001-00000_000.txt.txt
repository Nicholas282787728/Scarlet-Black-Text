Babes In Barracks Bearing Up,
But Will Be Evicted October 17

By Alice Powers

BULLETIN! A strange nat-
ural phenomenon has just been
reported to us from Bnley's
Bum Shelter in liaiucs base-
ment. Aln outsider, wandering
along in search of the lmlies’
wash room, was actually at»
ti-actcd — attracted, that is ——
to the charm and atmosphcro
of the place. “It was those love-
ly, lovely pipes", she mun
mured, as they tied her sleeves
behind her back and led her
away.

Loose hall girls living in baser
merit barracks are bearing up
magnificently and with hearten-
ing courage — and having a good
time, it was discovered this week
in an all-hole pole. Basement
recreation rooms, formerly used
for unimportant things such as
study, storage, and, oddly enough,.
recreation, have become meccas
of culture to the whole campus.

Take f'r instance Loose Hole‘
in Read. Its inhabitants uplift
their flagging morale with night-‘

 

 

1y bull fights, Spanish dances,
flyrkilling contests, and other edu-
cational features, it has been r
ported that they are even (lea
veloping an expeditionary force
for scientific exploration.

As a token of loyalty to their
new home, Loose Hole girls al-
so pause for a moment of silence
facing north every morning.

Rumor has it that Haydn has‘
been hidin’ in Balcy’s Bum Shel-
ter, because at almost any hour,
classic melodies (“I can shake my
hips like a taori dancer,” etc.)
may be heard rising from its
depths. When Cascy is not at bat,
strenuous jiu jitsu practices are
held, One never knows what
they’ll think of next in the way‘
of intramural sports, Residents

Girls in thc north room of the
James barracks unanimously dc-
clared that their favorite hobby
is gargling. with a little more

 

practice, they may soon even be
able to harmonize. At prcsciit,
the room bears a striking re—
semblance to a coke bottling
plant. To augment their schedule
of bridge tournaments and gar-
gling, many of them have taken
up the study of wild life and big
game, finding many spocrniens
for study right there at home,
Across the hall in the south
room, morale, for some reason
which its members refuse to di-
vulge, is at a delirious high, One
of the most crowded rooms in
the quad, there

But this carefree life will be‘

over for all girls living in the
barracks on next Friday, when
the north section of the new dorm

north section until completion of
