Joint Board passes resolution opposing proposed
Grinnell City Council ban on parking along Park Street

No final decisions have been made, but students returning from break may find fewer options

BYNIKKIJAMESON

Grinnell students returning to campus after fall break may
be confronted with a cruel irony: the banning of parking on
Park Street. Within the next few weeks, the Giinnell City
Council will be meeting to discuss the future ofpaiking on the
west side of campus, as concerns about access to the road fuel
debate on the campus Parking committee.

Currently, parking along Park street is limited to a 24-hour
period, though this frequently does not stop students from
continuously parking on the strip Director of Secrrrity StcV
phen Briscoe said he is concerned that “some of the cars look
abandoned, students park there then just don’t move."Because
students do not move once they’ve picked out their prime spot,
explained Briscoe, the Giinnell Police Department initiated a
request to the City Council out of concern about having access
to the North campus dorms in case ofa ﬁre.

Park street has been an area on the council agenda for a
while because not only does parking restrict emergency access,
but also it makes snow and leaf retrieval a challenge. How-
ever, SGA Vice

of
Student Affairs
Jan Koszewski
’08 questioned
those concerns.
“Personally, I
don’t know how
great ofa hazard
[the cars] are," he said. “I’m unsure that these restrictions are
necessary."

“ 've yet to hear one person come out in support," Kosze
wski added.

CND Senator and Parking Committee member Wyatt
Montague ’08 added that many students were surprised by the
plans. “The way it seems, this came out of the blue,” he said.
“Something needs to be done."

Regardless, students and staff at Grinnell have been tak~
ing action to respond to the council's move. Briscoc has been
soliciting campus input vra email, and Koszewski introduced a
Joint Board resolution that passed this week strongly oppose
ing the proposed changes. “We need to have a firm statement,"
Koszewski said. “Something we can present to the council
that is concrete."

Among those concerns is the significant disruption that
the loss of parking would create, “Those cars have to go some
where," Brrscoe said. “Either into the neighborhoods or over
to the East Campus and Darby lots.” Several options that have
been presented to smdents would implement alternate day
parking or eliminate parking during specifrc hours.

Still, for Montague the ideal option would be to continue to
allow parking along Park Street. “It’s imperative that students
voice their concerns and opinions."

“The college works hard to integrate with the community,”
he said. “It's important for us to be at the meeting so they un-
derstand our concerns."

Students seeking to improve their public
speaking skills can now frnd help from the
Debating Union. The new Speech Lab, de-
veloped by the Union to improve communica-
tion skills across campus, meets every Sunday
in the Debate House. The Lab provides the
npportumty for the house not only to fulfill its
goals as a project house, but also to provide a
ncw service to the campus,

“We asked ourselv ‘What coultl we pres
vidc to the community: said Caroline Bowlc
er '09, “There was a void there that we could
fill."

The membels of the Debating Union de-
cided to provide a speech Lab as a result at
their combined experiences in classrooms on
campus “It's really painful to listen to people
who have good ideas, but don't have (lll: confr
dencc to really express them," said Anna Gilr
bert'09.

Rosemarie Offord ’08 saw even more
evidence of the need for a Speech Lab at the
trustee open forum last week, “[The students]
came with some wonderful ideas and construc—
tive proposals," she said, “but I don't feel that
some of the presenters presented their ideas in
a way that would be completely effective to an
adult crowd."

With these observations in mind, the Des
baring Union initiated plans earlier this semesr
ter a plan for a Speech Lab focusing on come
munrcatioa skills, srmilar to the Writing and
Reading Labs. “There’s a certain skill base that
we have and develop as a debating union that’s
not taught at Grinnell,” said Alex Schcchtcr

'10. “The beauty of that is that we have this
skill set that we can pass on.”

Despite high hopes for the future of the
Speech Lab, the first two weeks have been un=
successful. Their frrst sunday open house was
the same‘cvcning as the tornado war rrirrgs, and
according to Scheclltcr, only a few students M,
tended the second meeting last week.

Accordrng to the Debating Union, profess
sets have been supportrve of the Speech Lab,
“So far, the professors have been super cnthur
siastic,“Schcchtei said.

Rebecca johnston ’09 agreed. “We’ve
contacted a lot of the tutorial professors, and
they've given us a lot of good feedback that
they'll recommend students to us."

“We think the professors feel this is somce
thing useful," Offord added. “But tlrcy'rc also
waiting to see how the students use it,"

Though Speech Lab is not as established
as Writing Lab or Reading Lab, the Debating
Union believes it has much to offer. And ace
cording to Bowkcr, thc Speech Lab’s indcpcm
deuce from the college is one ofits advantages,
"We make the choices," she said. “There’s no
one telling us how to run it.”

Gilbert emphasizes the house setting as
another advantage to the speech Lab. “It’s
much less formal," she said. “Speech Lab is
more a forum for people to practice and self-
evaluate."

And despite initial disappointments,
the students plan to continue with their efr
forts, “We’re still kind of testing the waters,"
Scheeliter said.

 

to go to jail over this," Mulholland said.

SGA could also simply take its salary in
crease from its budget, limiting the amount
available to student groups, or it could request
funding from tuition or the endowment, blur-
ring the traditional wall that has left SGA
funds without admin tion oversight.

But these options seem even less popular-
than raising the activities fee,

“None of [the options] seem par-rrtnlarly
great," said Rainstad, “Some of them sccm
hol‘rlble.'Y

The merit of the problem and the uumr
ber of hours has surprised everyone, include
ing Cabinet members themselves, Ramstad
expected to log 20 hours a week, but has not
clocked in under 21, going up to 30 one week.
According the Bishop, Cabinet as a whole av-
erages 25 hours a week.

The administration requested that Cabinet
members log their hours this semester to be
certain ofthis gapr “We're trying to get an idea
oft‘ime served,"said Mulholland.

This change will also have a signifrcant efr
feet on student publications and KDIC, which
also work by salary. “If we’re acnrally paid
hourly wages, it would be an insane amount of
money,”said Caitlin Carmody'os, the recently
elected SPARC chair. “I don‘t know ifSPARC
has that much money.”

Few appear to look forward to the likely
increase in salary.“1ts a service role and there
are perks associated with being on Cabinet,"
said Bishop. “[salaries] never been a signifi»
cant issue,"

“You take the job because you want to do it,
not because ofrhc pay," agreed Sinick.

But Bishop has decided on his own course
of action should SGA get its salary increases.
“If this gets put in place for next semester,1
will enter my hours fairly,"lie said, “and at the
end of the semester, give a restricted gift to
SGA for any amount 1 was pard above 51st
salary that i would have em nctl.” Bishop hopes
this action will set a precedent among Cabinet
members.

Sinick supports this idea. “I’d love to think
SCA cabinet would be willing to do that," he
said/‘1 like it as a solution ifwe can find a
way to institutionalize it."

But Ramstad is quick to point out that for
students facing debt and other financial limit
tations, this sacrifice may be difﬁcult to ask, “I
already work in addition to SGA," she sa .
“Money is something I think about a lot be
cause I come from a family that doesn't have
a lot." IfCabinet made the group decision to
give the difference back, she would do so, but
she emphasized that such a decision would
create much debate.

To discuss options and open debate to stri-
dents, SGA will sponsor an open forum on
Oct. 31 at 6 pm. in JRC 209,“Wc’re still wait-
ing on constituents," Ramstad said, emphasiz-
ing the need for students to giro imput.

Sinick remains concerned that students
will have negative reactions if salaries increase
so dramatically. “I'm worried about backlash if
salaries go up," he said. “it's not a choice and
most of us don't want it."
