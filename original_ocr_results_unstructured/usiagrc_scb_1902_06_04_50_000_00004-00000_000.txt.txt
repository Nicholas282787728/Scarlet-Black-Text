Miss Anger has a vnice nr pleas.
ing quality, and sang her numbers
with case and intelligence, Her
best work was done in a song with

sympathetic accompaniment to
Miss Anger's songs.

Miss Olds played three num.
bers. a three part invention by
Bach. Mozart's sonata in C major,

the slow movement of the sonata
