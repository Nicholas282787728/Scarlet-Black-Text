Black Hiring

Employment policy is receivinga great
deal of attention at Grinnell these days;
besides faculty and department sizes for
next year it has been the majorissue be-
fore the Executive Council,anda number
of women have begun to express their
concern about both employment andpro-
motion policies affecting them.

The Executive Council has reached a
tentative decision regarding the policy

it will follow for next year.

But the

Council has been reluctant to release
details of the new policy until it receives
a response from RandallMorgan to Pres-
ident Leggett’s letter whichprobably outs
lines the policy and asks for his sugges-

tions.

Our best guess is that the College will
try to make more of an effort thanit has
to get applications from qualified blacks
when a position opens on the campus. We
do not believe that the paucity of black
faculty members here is due toan unwill~
ingness to hire the qualified blackappli-
'cant, but rather that the College has not
made an effective enough effort to in»
crease the number of blacks in its pool
of applicants for a position.

From this pool ofapplicants the College
would probably have to make its selec-
tion so far as possible, on the basis of
professional excellence. But weare con-
fidenl: that by seeking black applicants

' more effectively .,than it has, Grinnel’l‘,

will begin to catch up with other schools
that have been able to findand hire quali-
fied black faculty members.

We think such a policy would be fair.

" The Mélropolilun Gri'linéll Area

by Ja ck Doppelt.

Because Grinnell admits so
many students from the met-
ropolitan New York and Chim-
go areas, the College must
somehow provide an alternar
tive existence for Big City
Folk.

It seems that the town of
Grinnell just doesn‘t make it.
The complaint that ”they roll
up the streets here at 7:00
p.m." doesn’t even apply, bee
cause the guy who is supposed
to do the rolling goes tobedat
6:30. This is much different
from New York, where every-
one gets involved in the roll-
ing.

To prevent Grinnell students
from forgetting theirupbring
ing, I will remind you of what
you are missing. If the Grin-
nelI Chamber of Commerce
takes head, We may fill some
of the necessary voids.

I would not have deemedpro-
gross at all conceivable in
Grinnell had 1 not detected the
first two warning signals of
urbanization. That's rightna
pool hall and a Pizza Hut!
Right here in Grinnell, Iowa!
The first big step on the road
to the depths ofdegradation. it
took a long time to get here

from River City.

I must concede, however re-
luctantly, thatthereisatnovie
theatre in town. Its popcorn
isn't bad, but the closest the
movies have come to four
stars was an astrology docUe
mentarv and “Patton". This
month the selection featured:

“Million Dollar Duck”--Se-
quel to “Goose that layed
the Golden Egg".

“Le Mans"“A foreign rac-
ist film.

“The House that Dripped
Blood"~taken from the
chilldran'stbmk .“TheLittle
Red Schoolhouse.”

”A Man Calledl—lorsemConr
cerning the escapades of one

of the Cartwright Brothers.
“The Reivers" - Documen-

tary of the effects of Marie

juana.

“Night of Dark Shadows"*-
Which can’t even compare
with the rendition Tom Safr
ley can do.

“They Call Me Trinity"-*
Sequel to “They Call the
Wind Maria".

”There Was a CrookedMan"
--Slanted version of "The
Hunchback of Notre Dame."

The only good movie, "Willy
Wonka", was cancelled. Be-
fore we cast unwarranted sus~
picions, remember Hollywood
is experiencing a recession.
At least the theater is there.
You can always play with a
glow ball, develop ncgalives,
or sleep through the movies
without feeling you've missed
something.

But how about those who den
serve a break and want to get
up and get away? There‘s no
McDonald's. What are we sup-
posed to do with the dollars we
get change fromwgo to a mo-
vie? By the time Grinnell gets
a MC Donald's franchise, Mc*
Donald’s will have sold 10
billion hamburgers. Economic
priorities Should be resevalur
ated. If Pizza Huts take pre-
cedence overMcDonald's, Grr
innell must have a trade a
greement with Italyandan em-
bargo with Scotland.

Grinnell also lacks a zoo for
Sunday afternoon outings. I’ve
heard some townspeople claim
that the college students are
all the animals the town can
cope with but in the light that
we haven’t been fed any pea-
nuts yet, I can’t categorize us
as zoo members.

People have complained of
no lake. Little do they know

that Lake Nyanza, a Grinnell
landmark, carries more por—

lutants thanany industrial face
toimfc‘duld‘, ever'hopéfio' pro- ‘
duce. As soon as 1 locate the
beach, lifeguard stands, and
blue water, I'll let you know.
Enough aesthetics. Accord-
ing to 3 Clark basement cons
sensus, Grinnell is devoid of
cathouses. Yes, I can see the

problem. The town doesn’t
even have a pickup strip. The
closesl thing to it is Broad
Street and that's only inname.
Rumors have it that the Post

Office with its pick-up window
slots posted ingoing, outgoing,
and special delivery, has some
underground connotations, but
I can't buy that. That would
be more far-fetched than the
rumors of bingo games in
churches.

Speaking religiously, Grin-
nell is without a synagague.
One might be built, but the
Jews fear that as soon as the
first temple is built, the Ro-
mans will come by and des-
troy ii. They foresee that the
second coming would be too
far off.

There arealsonohighrrises.
As it is, there is a complaint
withstanding that GatesTower
blocks the skyline. But Grin-
nell must consider all the
doormen in town who are out
of jobs. It's a tough predicar
ment but Grinnell can rise up
to meet it. '

There is also a noticeable
lack of public transportation.
New Yorkers have had a dif’
ficult time adjusting. I’ve seen
kids jumping in and outofem~
pty streets and dodgingparked
cars. Habitsare hardtobreak.
And what about Chicagoans
whose pocketsare bulging with
correct change'.7 Whatare they
to do? They can‘t spend it at
a McDonald’s. Plans fora sub-
way system between campus
and downtown should be imme
diately brought to the surface.

The absence ofprofessional
sports is also prevalent. With
present league expansions and
franchise liquidations, Grin»
nell could easily procure a
team. Gibson's parking lot
could serve as the sight for
the complex. and-McNally-fvs
lot could house the cars. Gr
nnell business would boom.

That is Grinnell in a nut-
shell. For now, be content
with the Herr-and funrseekr
ers, McNally‘s is open 24
hours a day.

Journeying Americans Discover legal Pol Shop In Nepal

We had finally arrived at the
Nepalese Embassy in Bangr
kok, after trekking in bela-
bored agony through the hut
mongous jungle ofcementand
solar reflection. The building
was rather quaint for an ems
bassy, but Nepal isn’t the big-
gest place in the world. After
an hour wait, we were able to
speak with the Ambassador
and learn a bit more about our
coming destination. He greets
ed us with a warm smile and
a firm grip.

After rapping for several
minutes he ended the conver
sation with a bit of classical
irony: “I see that you are
hippies...your long hair, dirty
look, and ragged outfits. And
I realize that thousands of
‘hippies like yourselves are
converging upon my country
for our heralded hashish,
which I am quite sure you
realize is legal. But don't
think it upsets me. Why should
I be upset? My people have
been smoking hashish for over
two thousand years!" As one

sequence was truly hard to
believe.

We finally boarded the long
awaited flight to Kathmandu.
The following is an excerpt
from my meticulously kept
diary:

"After entering the last ad
dition, yes, the mountains did
show up at first like puffy

clouds but later there was no
doubt as to their majestic
stature. They were the Himar
layansrrbright reflections of
downy snowmolded into jagged
peaks rising to incredible heir
ghts. As we approached Kath-
mandu, we saw the nestled
valley and surrounding ring of
mountains, dwarfed bya mag-
nificent backdrop of giants.
Descending from the jet was

warm hot sun,and crisp virgin
air-rsurrounded bymountains
hued in greens and browns,and
a circumference studded with
old temples and small come

"Customs was a bit stiff“
but after a brief inspection
hassle we settled on a hotel
with one of the many hawkers.
The drive (ina 1947 Plymouth)
was an absolute mind-boggle
, ’[he city was instantly a rel-
ic, and the people saturating
the streets provided an inn
credible composition of ages
passed...After settling in the
hotel, we decided to enter the
bizarre outer world. To dess
cribe the ensuing adventurs is
both literally and metaphori-
cally impossible-superficial
at best.

“After a short walk, we had
suddenly entered the environs

retain our sanity. The complex

exotic dessert civilizations,
and the ancient courts of no-
bility: cobbled streets lined
with puddles of urine and
excrement, ragged children

much the color and design of
court jesters, holy men draped
in lengths of uncut hair and

tions."

After hearing about it for so
long, and lured by our native
intrigues and rather expanded
satiety centers, we finally fell
upon a government’authorized

shop:

“.mthen via the directions
from some Nepalese hustler I
got to the hashish Shop. There
he sat (Sharma), clad in a
heavy Nepalese outfit; Wicrd
pants that hugged the oxygen
from the skin of his legs, a
dark silky jacket, a weird
flaps ovcr shirt, and of course
a small blackbcanic ofsoris.
Before him on a large table
was a scale, designedtowoigh
per “told“ (11.6 gm).. Behind
liim sat large spheres of hash
(some easily weighing more
than five pounds). pressed

hunks of ganja which looked
more like rotten bark than
grass, and small attenuated
pieces of hash which he called
”finger rolls".

He quoted a price of6 rupe
pees pcr tola (about 32¢ US.)
and offered samples of any

grade desired.
I could go on and on, ad

infinitum. And surely this
scanty sketch of sorts is a
disservice to the absolute
wonderment awaiting any
Westerner in Nepal. Hope-
fully several of the following
articles will include more den
tail and discussion of the Hi-
milayan time warp.
