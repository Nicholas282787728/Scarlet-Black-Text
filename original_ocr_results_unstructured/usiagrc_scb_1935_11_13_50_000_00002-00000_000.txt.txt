BEING OF SERVICE

The idea of service brings to
the average person the thought
of those in the professions—
medicine, law and other forms
of public service, Yet, business,
and more specifically industry,
may be one of the greatest
fields in which the performance
,of actual service toward man»
kind may be achieved,

Few people know that Henry

Ford lost 69 millions of dollars
in one year of operation during
the depression, But, through
this act and through the estab-
lishment ofa car in the low-
priced field, Henry Ford has
done more in the way of ser.
vice, especially through raising
the standard of living, than the
majority of our professional
men. ,
He has done a great deal to.
ward the redistribution of
wealth by’providing a job for
thousands of men when it
would have been easier for him
to have closed his shops and
gone off to Europe or some
other place. We do not know
exactly why he did this. Per—
haps, it was for an ulterior pur-
pose, but the fact Nmains that
he did do this, which shows
that it is possible for industri»
alists to be men of service as
well as ogres or parasites.

Each year thousands of men
are leaving college and going
into this same great industry,
in which Ford is but a leader in
one branch, Most of these new
recruits in the field of industry
do not realize or do not stop to
think that the easiest and per-
haps the most enjoyable way of
making money is by being of
service to manln'nd.

Instead, the common view, so
deplorable yet so prevalent, is
symbolized by the term, “get
rich quick.” This haste for
riches often results in the
trampling upon of the less for.
tunate and certainly cannot be
classed as a benefit to mankind,
This view is entirely Wrong and
must fail in the end, for we are
not entirely independent of one
another, but instead are de-
pendent upon our fellow men.

How much better this world

could be made by the whole-
hearted adoption of this view»
point, is it matter for specula
tion, That it would be better is
but a natural assumption. Let
Ms then carry this view beyond
the point of speculation and
make it a fact. Let us go into
industry with this idea of ser—
vice to mankind and by preach.
ing it to all, bring“ about the
realization that the satisfaction
and enjoyment of life comes
from being of service instead of
from merely acquiring material
things. -

THE CONSTITUTION
(nrexol Triangle, rhiludclphia)
More than a century and a half

ago, representatives from thirteen
colonies met and drew up 2. mar
tcrpiecc of statosnumship for guid-
ance of future generations in the
new republic.

In it were incorporated the fun~
dumeutals of t c democracy. The
government was ill ided into three
main parts—legislative, executive.
and judicial, each acting as acheck
ou the other to prevent seizure of
power by any one group if such an
attempt were made.

These first citizens promulgated
a document with adequate prnvi»
sions for continuing the democracy
,in succeeding generations. They in-
cluded in its numerous sections 51117
ficieut directions for running the
republic as it was at the time of its
inception. .

Then these farrseoing patriots
went further and provided for
amendments in order that their dc-
sceildunts might be able to adopt
the governing principles to cllang~
ing times, for they realized that
such a condition .was inevitable.

Since the ratification of that
document, changes have taken
place that even those wise men
could not foresee. From just a
small section of the continent we
have expanded from ocean to ocean
and even beyond, The horse and
wagon have given way to far more
swift methods of transportation
and communication. Immigration
has made us a veritable "melting
pot" of human races.

From the slow-moving agricul-
tural system has arisen a time de-
vouring machine age. Then a few
thousand as wealth; we now must
have millions. Despite this radical
transition, our constitution has
proved itself adequate, and to date
ehmlges have been properly taken
care of by amendments. But grad»
ually the machine monster has
crept upon us, resulting in uneme
ploymellt, disjointed production,
and concentration of wealth into
fewer hands with the consequent
suffering of many.

Thc masses of our workers have
hitherto suffered in silence, but
now with assured relief from this
situation still uncertain, a mute
muring has arisen. snow for a
time by government dole, it is again
growing more insistent. Men find
their initiative and pride being
stiiled by this giving of aims. A
cry for such social reforms as Old
Age Pensions, Unemployment 1n-
surancc, Universal Child Labor
Laws, and a more equitable mime
tion program arises.

To date wealthy interests have
voiced their desires and have run
the country to their advantage
with little or no thought for the
workers. When the average citizen
asks for reforms, he is called un—
patriotic by those who havc
brought on rhc present plight by
their “rugged individualism."

DORIC

(.l Column 01‘ Pine Beauty)

Last week various members of
the staff were fol-ecu to listen
to criticism because of the style
in which the Doric is being wri
ten now, and because of the ins
formation which it contains.
Before that we were criticized
because it didn't contain any-
thing. We can't please every-
body, but we do believe that it's
the straight goods you want, nnd
not a bunch of sil y baloney,

If you want it we can give you

a lot of tripe like this:

Tillie Whatnotz and Johnny
Knowitall are holding hands in
public again. Tsk, tsk, you two.
Didn't you know this is a Chris
tian institution and such things are
frowned upon“ But after all, when
the weather is so fine and all, how
can we object to a little display of
affection, even if it is so ﬂagrant
as all that? So our fondest blesss
ings to you. May the course of
true love ever run smooth.

If that’s the kind of junk you
want we’ll give it to you, and
gladly, because it’ll save the
staff of this paper from dodging
all the birds with blood in their
eye who come looking for us
after emch Wednesday issue.
Nevertheless, We don‘t think
that's what you want.

Of late this has gotten to be
nothing better than an index of
the latest steadies. However,
'it's always of interest to lmow
what po, ibiiities for dates have
been eliminated duriug the week.
First on this week’s roster is
Betty nun Waller of the yard-
loug line, who announces that at
some future. time she and Clint
Ranier are going to take up

According to rumor, however, the
