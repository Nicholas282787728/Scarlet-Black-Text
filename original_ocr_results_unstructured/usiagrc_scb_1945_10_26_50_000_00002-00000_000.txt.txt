Shop Talk - —

Today we bring to you 'the
Gl‘innell Shopper‘s Guide, In

order to make up for the in—
adequacy of last week‘s ad-

verti 'ng, we have had to
carry much more than fifty
per cent advertising to pay
our printing bill. Last week,

we brought you an extreme-
ly high per centage of news
This week, we must ask you
to bear with us.

Which brings us to our
point. We don‘t like to have
to print the kind of paper
that cannot carry complete
campus coverage because of
space limitations. We believe
that after this issue makes
up our advertising- deficit,
we can again carry a mode-
rate amount of advertising,
and that we can secure that
advertisingiif our sem fee
allotment as submitted to
and approved by the Student
Council and faculty com-
mittee is not out. Last week
we told you of the proposed
out. This week we show you
what will happen every week
if that budget is slashed.
This week we bring you the
Grinnell Shopper’s Guide.

Gates Ghosts.
Serenade Quad

Did you know that there are
ghosts in Gates? Well, brethren,
you won’t hear it from the per-
sonnel oiiiee, even though these
are very personaple ghosts, and
you won’t read it in the “herd"
book, either. Tiieir names were
not listed with the ,“A's”, but
rumor Says it's Anonymous. Such
neglect}

They're real ,though. You just
don’t hear the Gates sweetheart
song in your dreams plus a hot-
tle of beer, or something, with
“Row, Row, Row," .

Not‘ the

Biggest,

Just the
Best!

ished with “That's what it was
like before the war.”
