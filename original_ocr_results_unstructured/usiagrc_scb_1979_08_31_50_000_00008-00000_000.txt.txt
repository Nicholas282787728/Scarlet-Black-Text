‘00 President Drake: philosophy and outlook

by Andvew 5min

George Drake brings a refreshing
sincereity to some liberal education
phrases which many might consider
tired. Drake attended Grinnell at a
time when the notion of the liberal
arts education was less ambiguous
than it is today. In the Fifties, Grin-
nell offered a more classical introduc-
tion to the Western tradition of
thought, literature, and arts.”

Drake, as an historian, sees a Pat-
tern {or those who have partaken oi
this ”richest experience” of liberal
arts education. He sees students going
out from Grinnell and making signifi»
cant contributions to the society.

“I conceive of Grinnell’s role to pro-
vide a liberal education, not skill or
job training. Here students should
gain an appreciation for the intellec~
tual and spiritual. They should learn
to think critically and broadly about
problems,” Drake explained.

Grinnell students Drake has met
with have impressed him with their
variety and their sense of awareness
about the world. “There‘s a quality of
concern here that is rather unusual,”
he said.

Students have shown great concern
about college investments. Drake
would like to keep a dialogue going on
the problem of owning shares in com-
panies which deal with South Africa.
“I don't think it is a simple issue," he
said. Drake added that students
should be aware of the position of the
trustees. The trustees, he explained,
are looking out tor the long-term in-
terests of the college, while students
tend to concern themselves with short»
term issues. “It is unrealistic that
students not interest themselves in the
business aspect of the college,” Drake
remarked. “But believe it or not, the
people on the Board are remarkably
enlightened. They are people oi cons-
cience who care as passionately as
students about these issues.

other issues which will come up for
action by Drake are a decision on the
use of Mears now that it is no longer a
dormitory, grading and curriculum
changes, iaculty tenure, and physical
plant changes. Drake says he will
study carefully each area before he
comes up with specific plans for ac-
tion. He did say, however, that he
would like to affect what he terms
“cosmetic” changes to the campus to
make the college both more func-
tionally cificient and aesthetically
pleasing. The library will be one of the
targets of this plan for renovation and
taceelit‘ting,

Drake is also reserving judgement
on the question oi distribution re.

oounaqo woaa do more

quirements. These requirements were
implemented while he was at Colorado
College, but he concedes that such re-
quirements may not be appropriate
for Grinnell.

This summer, Drake mailed out let»
ters to students and parents notifying
all of the possibility that a iuel oil
shortage may force the college to
lengthen the duration of the winter
break between semesters in order to
conserve on fuel consumption A final
decision on the matter is expected
Within two weeks. ”The sooner the
decision is made, the better," he said.

With predictions of “the worst
winter yet” being pronounced, Drake
hopes to encourage energy conserva~
tion amongst the college community,
“People will respond to reasonable ei-
forts to conserve energy,” he said.

For the longer term, Drake admits
the college faces some tough deci»
sions. Discussions will begin shortly
on the question of converting the
pysical plant irom oil to possibly a
coal-burning system, The student-
administration-[aculty Energy Policy
Advisory Committee, formed by exe

iting Vice Provost Ken Browning, will
continue to meet and discuss other
possibilities of alternative energy
sources for the college.

Drake also foresees additional per-
manent calendar changes as the
winters become more severe and oil
supplies dwindle. When asked if he
would tender the possibility oi making
Grinnell a year-round college, he said
he would be willing to consider such
an idea. Under a year-round plan, the
college would be in session fall, spr-
ing, and summer. During the summer.
students would be engaged in efforts
to make Grinnell more self-sufficient,
both in energy and other basic needs.

If such a plan were ever im-
plemented, the Grinnell students
Drake, sees as making significant con-
tributions to society could begin their
efforts in their own backyard. Thus, in
a very direct way, students would be
keeping vital the institution that
nourished their own growth as respon-
sible and aware members of society.

“I wouldn‘t rule anything out,"
Drake said
