THE GRINNELI: SCARLFA‘ AND BLACK

 

 

College Folk Stay Close, Scribe Says;
Exams to Enter Get Stiffer, Stiffer

Let those who are salely within
the college walls cling close, and
those who are outside make haste to
enter, tor each year the entrance re»
ouireuients grow more formidable.
The College Entrance Examination
hoard, the roost etlective bogey lor
prep school students ever invented,
and which started among a small
clique ot eastern colleges, has now
stretched tentacles even so tar as the
University of Southern Calitornia:
and last year exams were given as
far as Persia and Korea,

Protessor Seashore pt Iowa univer-
sity has proposed that all the cola
leges in the couuti agree on a ser-
ies ot stringent achievement and apti-
tude tests to inquire into the desir-
ability ot prospective collegians.

Opposition In Ensl

The exam board now carries on
such a vast husiness that last year
it considered raising a million dollar
endowment iund. Instead, however,
it hit upon the plan or selling Latin
wordrlists. The sale of several (nous
and last year met the deiicit.

In opposition to the healthy growth
or the exam hoard, several educators
point out that the eastern preparatory
schools have developed a technique
tor putting through tumlly inconr
petent students. A survey at Yale
revealed that the private school
gaushoes iar excel their public school
contemporaries in entrance exam
grades and in extracurricular activi—
ties attcr they get in, but they are
quite hopeless as students, and the
public school boys run off with all
the Phi Beta Kappa keys,

Stanford Quits System

Hence many colleges have sought
other means of separating the sheep
from the goats, and intelligence tests
have been widely adopted. Among
girls especially the aptitude scores
correlate very closely with the grades
they get in their college courses; Coir
orado State Teachers lound that in
a ﬁve grade system (like Grinnell’s)
marks can he predicted within a
third of a grade trom aptitude scores.
The men's schools have found the re-
sults a little more uncertain.

Leland stanlord has abandoned
comprehensive examinations on the
ground that they place too great 01 re
strictions on the subjects which pre-
paratory students may study, and
force them to learn the specitie
points that the exams are likely to
ask about. So in the interest at high

school autonomy the Thorndike apt'i3

tude test Was made the major basis
of consideration, supplemented hy a
study of the student’s high school
record,

“My business is to speak with stu-

"The purpose of the league is to
bring helore college groups the social
