: Questionable labor
practices right on

our doorstep

b~ rndd Perry

"To see what’s wrong with our world. we
don't have to go any iarther than our iront
doorstep.” These are the words of
colunmist Colman McCarthy. who spoke
at Grinnell College several weeks ago. Re
cent events at the College. my ”front
doorstep" for almost four years. have
demonstrated to me just how true McCar-
thy's statement is,

Since my freshman year. I have made a
point of speaking with College employees,
These people have been a special part or
my experience here. simply because they
oiler an escape from the high-pressure

tional Labor Relations Board rules did not
seem to bother the Local 90 representative
who knew of the recording. .

Students remained largely unaware of
the workers' situation, The students' lack
of awareness was no fault of their own.
Food Service employees know that exten-
sive contact with students is discouraged
by McConnell, In the past. good workers
have been demoted for such contact.

Just how unaware students were
became quite clear when President
George Drake told Student Government
President Matt Golden that student Food
Service workers “could” lose their jobs if

world of academia Therefore. when l was
lnlormed of the many difficulties that staf-
fers have faced while working for the Col-
lege. I decided to take a closer look at the
College's employment policies,

My iniormation on the college‘s employ
ment policies comes mostly iron. the
employees themselves. In the past.
employees who have spoken with students
about this sensitive issue. have felt

the workers went union. Golden. at
Drake's behest. announced this “possibili-
ty" at an SGA meeting, Drake backed up
his statement with the assertion that
students lost their partstime jobs with BtzG
when it Joined Local 90 in 1970.

Golden’s announcement was published
in the son minutes. Understandably.
many students believed him. Neither oi
these presidents consulted the Union. the

Last January, Grinnell College Fund
Service Employees decided to try and join
Teamsters Union Local 90. based in Des
Moines. This ariiliation was only natural.
because the College's maids and Buildings
and Grounds toxic) workers already
belonged to the Local 90,

their statements.

As I reported in an 5&8 article the
following week. students have not worked
for. B&G . during the school year since
Drake attended Grinnell in 1956, Neither
the Teamsters nor the workers wanted to
get rid oi the student laborers. The ques
tion of student employment was not even
an issue to them.

On March 13. Grinnell College Food Ser»
vice workers voted Zl-13 for unionization.
This was their second union vote since Mc-
Connell started running the college's Food

Although the last employee to be fired
took his case to the Iowa Civil Rights Com-
mission. the other four were afraid to
challenge Food Service Director Dave Mos
Connell’s decisions. Their first concern
was to find another job in the town of Grin»
hell. where McConnell is mayor.

Over 15 Food Service employees have
lost their jobs with McConnell since 1979.
Some had nearly completed eight years or
service [or the College. Had they not been
fired in their eighth year, they would have
been eligible for retirement benefits. Most
have found better jobs than the ones that
they had with the college. These 15 in-
dividuals were some of the best workers.
according to the people who worked with
them daily.

When I found out about the workers'
organizing attempt. 1 reported their efs
forts in the 5&8, The articles which Editor
Robert Quashie and I wrote constituted the
only press that these efforts ever received.
Workers were afraid to approach even us.
for fear that their names would find their
way back to McConnell.

Food Service employees were airaid to
Speak amongst themselves during this
period. making their organizing effort all
the more difficult. AS the March 13 union
votc approached. it became evident that
their paranoia was warranted Conversas
tions between the workers were being
s retly recorded by at least one
employee.

employees who wore know it to be opposed

lacl that such recordings (”'0 against Mr

wages, If a strike situation. which McCon-
nell mentioned in a letter to workers in an
attempt to convince them not to join the
Teamsters. does occur. it will not develop
due to the “unreasonableness” of the
workers' demands.

Before the Food Service employee’s vote
occurred. a new issue came to my attene
tion. College maids were being iorced to
use a new disiniectant. oral, manuiac-
tured by Hillyard Chemical Company.
Maids using the product began experienCs
ing severe burns. blistering. nausea and
eye irritation

During the tour weeks oi its use. at least
seven maids received medical orders from
local doctors and outofstown specialists
not to use QT-4. BﬂtG Director Dale Hawn
repeatedly told maids that these physi-
cians “lacked the speciiic knowledge”
necessary to determine the safety of the
product. Local doctors were iurious.

Maids were told that they would be fired
if they used any product besides QTsd.
They were warned not to speak with
students about the product. Like Food Scr~
vice employees. maids have always known
that speaking with students is not looked
upon iovorahly by their superiors.

thli Q'l‘s-I was lil'st distributed. the
maids were repeatedly told that it was
slilc. but \tci’c at thL' Sumo llmc warned to
keep it all ol skin tlllti clothing Although
the product's saiety shccl "recommends

maids handled (yr-4 concentrate and were
not furnished with eye protection.

Continued complaints about QT~4 pro-
mpted l-lawn to invite James G. Ross,
director oi Legislative and Regulatory Af-
iairs for l-lillyard. to campus, to train the
maids how to “safely" use the product.

Ross tried to reassure the maids of the
product's safety by claiming that QT-4 was
being used at Grinnell General Hospital.
According to a local doctor who consulted

hospital maintenance personnel. QT~4 has
never been used at Grinnell General.
When maids asked Hawn at a meeting
why they needed to use this new product.
Hawn said. “Grinnell College has been
luckier than other colleges” because it has
not experienced any serious" epidemics or
AIDS or Herpes.” (0T4 is categorized as a
simple “quat” disinfectant. meaning that
it is not more eiiective in killing germs
than Lysol or other namebrand disiniec—
