Success for Model
United Nations in
Big Chicago Event

By Alexander Kamboroglou

The Model United Nations
(M.U.N.),nowinit_ssecondycoron
campus, has come a long way from
a ﬁlful start. Grinnell‘s learn of
Eddie Nginilla, Rachel Bligh,
MichaelMckibbcn.lillCetina,Judlt
Balassa ondJutita Szilagyi won the
award for Best Delegation to the
General Assembly at the Chicago
M.U.N. conference last week.

Itsbegtnntnglastiallwasatough
one, however, It was almost
singlchandcdly set up by Nginllla
in what was the firstsomcsterol his
freshman year,

“I had five years of experience
from high-school in Tanzania,
where wehad bccntnscvcralM.U.N
conferences in Africa imd Europe,
and so i decided to try and start a
clubheretoo,"sainginilld. Within
a month of registration at the to-
rum, M.U.N. Grinnell had had 47
members, but was very short of
experience.

“I was the only one that knew
whatitwasallabout.sollookedfor
people who had done it before,"
said Nginilla. ”I found three, Wil
Kldss, David Gassawal and Norma
Mendoza. who all helpeil a great
deal. This year though, all oruieni
are not here. and so I’m basically
theonlypetsonlefifromtheorigina]
group."

So Grinncll College’s M.U.Ni
wascreatcd. Butnowcamethetask
of linking the organization here to
others around the country. First.
the people involved in MiUiN. had
to get lists of other conferences
around the United States. They had
also to buy books for orientation
and parliamentary procedure and
teach themselves the rules of the
game. With all other prepamiions
complete. it was now time to at}
proach SGA’s Joint Board for
money to cover the cost of their
books,

”l‘heftrsttimelwenttotheloint
Board meeting. all they did was to
argue about silly things they knew
nothing about.“ stated Nginilla.
Joint Board slashed the budget by
"something like two-thirds." What
happened eventually was that much
of the material had to be put on
reserve at the library. Withso many
members already. this was an ex-
tremely awkward arrangement.

Grinnell'sM.U.N,begantoprer
pare for its first conference, in St.
Louis, in which it would represent
Turkey. There the team did “kind
of well" as Nginilla put it. Even
though it was up against tough
competition. the team won the right
to address the General Assembly,
which was quite an accomplish
ment considering the fact that St
Louis is the 2nd largest M.U.N.
conference in America, Later,
members of the group attended a
conference in Omaha, Nebraska.

Even this was only an appetizer
for the success last week in Chi-
cage. ntis has helped to further
cement in place tin organization
thatisonlyayearold. importantly,
budgets are now secure and much
tnore adequate than last year. Fur-
thermore, M. .N. is scoring many
pointsintcn-nsofoducutionalvalue.
it is also highly competitive.

“AlotofM.U.N. giveawards
for the top ten delegations," said
Nginilla, “and a lot of schools rcr
qutretheirteamstodowell in order
to fund them,and these two reasons
unfortunately work as incentives
for participants to have an attitude
of dog cat dog. Other than that. it
has been one of the best experi-
ences ofmy life. Peoplewhodogct
involved in theM.U.N. getto know
alotabouttheworld,andgenerally,
I think itcreates a healthy spiritof
intemationalism which I think is
very good. it is still dog-eat-dog,
but people improve by participat-
ing."

One of their future plans is the
creation ofa small Model Security
Council to be attended by Grinnell
highrschool and College students,
as well as students from near areas.
Even though some professors are
questioning the chance of this idea
lobecomereality.Nginillabelieves
that if they give it a try, it might
work out fine.

Last June Nginilla and Klass
were sponsored by the Stanley
Foundation and the Iowa Peace In
stitute to attend a M.U.N organiz-
ers seminar meeting in New York
City. Nginillasays that they learned
many things that will help the team
to improve. With their Chicago
award under their belts, few would
dispute that the team’s members
have learned much in the
organization's short history.

International Students
Educate Grinnell Kids

By Siddartiia Agarwal

For many first through fourth
graders at Davis Elementary School
in Grinnell, a Saturday morning
runs something like this. The
children play games and draw pic-
tures. They listen toan international
studenirromGrinnellCollegespeak
abouthtsorherhomccountry. And
with students they participate in
such aciiviues as scavenger hunts.

between Grinncll College's inter»
national SiudentOrganization (iSO)
and the town of Grinnell,

The Davis program was started
three years ago by a Grinncll stu-
dent, According to one person in»
volved in the program, its original
purpose wastogtvo theDavisschool
first to fourth graders something
better to do on Saturday momtngs
besides sitting in the house Which
ing cartoons and getting in the way
of their parents.

The program has now evolved.
On Saturday mornings, an interna-
tional student speaks to the chidren
about his or her country - its cus-
toms. language and culture. He or
she answers all the many questions
the youngsters have about their
country. such as the ieod. what Ihe

school system is like, how much
one studies, and what one does for
fun. Then they participate in some
kinds ofoctivities which vary from
week to week.

Presently theleader of the Davis
Program is Emily McGary. a junior
aiGrinnell, Sheis trying to gener»
ate more interest in the program.

“Our biggest problem is volunr
leer commitment. We just don’t
have enough student volunteers to
make this program as successful as
i would like it to he " The program
is not Just limited to international
students, but includes American
students as well. She needs people
who have fun spending uirte with
and entertaining young children,

The program does not just help
the children understand different
cultures better, but also has another

purposei Many of these children
come from disfunctional families.
Also. some of them have behavior
problems and learning disabilities.
This gives them a healthier envi-
ronment in which to spend some of
their time.

“The Davis School program is
for everybody,” added McGary.
“Everybody has a good time, and
everybody learn: something new,
Americans learn about foreign
countries, international students
learn about Americans, and every-
body learns about working and
playing together. Alotol the kids
who come on Saturday have prob~
terns at hotne, and i_iust love to see
them havtngagoodtime. Allofthe
student volunteers go away happy.
and more often than not, pleasantly
