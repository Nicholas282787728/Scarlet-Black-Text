An Open Letter to the Man
Who Stands in Line For

An Increase in Salary
In the Next Five Years,
And Also Who Has Obligations to

Protect N ow.

IF YOU ARE IN YOUR TWENTIES OR EARLY THIRTIES, employed, and hard at Work on the
foundation of your future success, you will be interested in this open letter.

LAYING A FOUNDATION IS NOT SPECTACULAR WORK. It doesn’t bring requests for inter-
views ill the magazines, or big immediate cash l'ctul'lls. These come later when the structure of
your business career begins to tower above its well built base.

SOME DAY YOUR INCOME WILL BE MUCH LARGER, but you feel an obligation to protect
what liabilities you have at present, and to those, this letter should appeal.

 

THIS NEW POLICY IS A FAIR COMPARISON to renting a place to live or buying, (“ch mg
the shelter of Life Illsurancc") and paying rental rates instead of buying permanent protection.
\Vllat do we metm by “renting the shelter of. life illsur lee?” Simply this. THE TRAVELERS
INSURANCE COMPANY issues a policy known as the your Tel-hr with Conversion to Ordinaiy
of Limited Payment Life. Its cost for the ﬁrst fivc years is low. Only slightly over $50 per $5000
insurance at age 23 annually, to be exact $52.40 annually, $26.85 semi-annually and $13.55
quarterly. At the end of ﬁve years this policy converts into Ordinary Life (or any other type of
policy you select) at the cost for your age at the time of the conversion or at the ttgc of original
contract.

AN UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THIS CONTRACT is its permanent total disability provision,
(3 months is proof of permanency), and beneﬁts «late from inception of Disability This provides
that if you sustain permlancnt total disability before reaching age 60 the premiums which fall due
during such disability will be waived and the company will pay you from the beginning of such
disability and during its continuance an income of $50 pCI‘ month for each $5,000 of life insurance.
The premiums so waived and the disability income paid will not be deducted in any settlement of
the policy. So liberal a disability provision is not customary in term policies. Without disability
, the rates are $40.30 annually, $20.65 semi-annually or $10.45 quarterly.

CAN YOU AFFORD TO DELAY THE PURCHASE OF LIFE INSIRANCE; to run the risk of
leaving your obligations unprotected in case of your death; to take the chance of being unable to
secure life insurance when you want it. Can you, when you can get a. policy that offers the highest
grade of temporary protection at a very low rate for 3. period of ﬁve years, and then offers you
the opportunity to convert into any type of policy you select without 2t medical examination.
