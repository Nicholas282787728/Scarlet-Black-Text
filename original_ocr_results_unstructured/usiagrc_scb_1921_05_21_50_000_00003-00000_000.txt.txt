Chinese Use Wheelbarrow: to
Carry Food to Starving
Fellow Countryrnen.

ord comes 1' in Miss Alice Read,
a graduate of Grim-tell and a sister-in-
law of rroiessor Hartson, from her
mission in North China that the condi-
tions among the starving people there
are terrible. Miss Read says that the
transportation tacilities are very in—
adequate and it has even been found
necessary to form wheel barrow b ‘
gndcs among the coolies to transport
gmill as far as a hundred miles.

“It is not so hard to see the old and
infirm die of starvation because they
must soon pass away anyhow.” she
writes, ”but to see the boys and girls
and babies starve to death, and be
unable to render assistance, makes the
heart sick. I wonder what the future
of these live provinces in North China
is to be if the coming generation
starves."

Miss Rea/d makes it. pathetic plea.
irom her mission for help from the
people here in America.

—“I AM

A Mystery S t o r y of

unusual interest.

This is an exceptionally

good picture—and is high-

ly recommended.
PRICES:

u

“I AM GUILTY!”

An absorbing mystery story, lavish:
ly produced, with a star whose forte
is emotional characterization—this is
“I Am Guiltyi" starring Louise Glnum
The picture will be the feature attrac—
tion at the Colonial theatre next Sat-
urday and Sunday. The star plays the
part of a neglected wife who accepts
the invitation or a friend froin the
days of tlle- chorus to take a last fling
at pleasure. Following the party, the
host meets death in a mysie ious man.
ner and as a result the wife is drawn
in the web which is built around the
tragedy. A burn on the shoulder.
caused by a struggle with the host
caused the guilt to be placed against
the neglected spouse,

The situation proves to be excep-
tionally dramatic. Her husband re
turns and is employed as the attorney
of the defense. Circumstances bring
him into accusing his own wife of
the crime. It looks hopeless and the
husband gives up the case. To relate
any more would be giving the picture
away to the spectator. But ”I Am
Guilty!” is dramatic, carries the m.-
most in mystery and suspense, and
is finely acted by Miss Gloum and a
cost that includes Mahlon Hamilton.
Joseph Kilgollr and Ruth Stonehousc.
The picture is handsomely staged.

“Tim EDUCATION or ELIZABETH”

‘It is as a charming, fun—loving
chorus girl who is very real beneath
her rouge and powder, that Billie
Burke will be seen in her latest Parri-
mount picture, "The Education 0!
Elizabeth," which will be the feature
at the Strand theatre next Sunday. No
role Miss Burke has had in recent pro.
ductions has been better suited to her
vivacious and captivating personality.

The heroine meets Thomas Fairfax.
of an old Colonial family and he wins
her consent to their marriage. But
first hc takes her to the family home
to meet his sister. Lucy. Lucy decides
that Elizabeth‘s manners need polish—
ing up belore sbc assumes the name
of Fairfax. so she and another broth-
Cl‘. Ha ,. begin to educate the girl.
This ends most happily.
