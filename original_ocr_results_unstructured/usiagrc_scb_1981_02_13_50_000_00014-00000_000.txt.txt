Another View. of the Presidency

To the Editor:

. As another weekend draws near a
close and I face another week at classes
I (eel com lled to take time out to res-
pond to t 9 article "Uniting Behind
Reagan " published in the Jan. 30 edi-
tion of the Sim. The article contains
several misconceptions about
democracy, thus leading to the faulty
conclusxon that now is the time {or the
liberals at our nation to put aside their
political interests for the common good.
The ﬁrst misconception imposes a sort
of winner-take-all nature ol democracy
while the second misconception
assumes that it is the job or the presi-
dent to determine and see to the execu-
tion of the public good. The third
misconception is as dangerous as the
others are sell-serving. This
misconception is that not all people are
needed in the political arena and that a
person can actually determine which
groups are and are not needed. 1 pro-
pose in this letter to correct the above
misconceptions. thereby arrlvmg at a
different. more theoretically valid con»
clusion.

‘ tn the article the author states "novi
he. tReaganl is president and deserves
all the respect and suport we can give
him as he begins his administration. '
The whole system 01 American
democracy is purposetully structured
so that those with minority Views are
given channels in which to exercise
their political inlluence so that power is
controlled by the conflicts 01 different
i'actions. This saleguard 01 the abuse oi
power would be destroyed it, on Nov. 5.
all liberals just said, "Uh well. Reagan
won. so i guess I'll just give him a hand
in carrying out his policies. which I
despise."

- in the linal paragraph ol “Uniting
Behind Reagan" the claim is made that
E'Lhe problems that the country laces
can be solved only it the public is will-
ing to support the eiiorts oi the presi-
dent." This claim has a great deal ol
.validity to it it you accept the implied
premise that the president has the
answers to the nation’s problems. If.
however. you suspect that the prest»
dent's stand on one or two issues could
possibly be detrimental to society then
the indiscriminate support at the presr
dent by the general public could un»
doubtedly cause irreparable damage.

1 According to the theory of democracy
proposed in the article the president is
to (ind answers to all the nation's pro
blems through his Vision ol the public
good while the people are expected to
support his eiloris even it they perceive
these efforts to be in conﬂict with their
bwn vision or the common good or with
their own sell-interest. This View or

$14

democracy reveals not only a totally
unrealistic View of human nature but II
is also completely ioreign to the view oi
democracy upon which this nation was
lounded; the View which believes thul
men and women w ill ulw ays participate
in pollCles as they deem it to be in their
sell-interest. once again we see a
desire tor a centralization ol power
which is not only detrimental to
American democracy but can be very
dangerous ii that power were to lull in
the hands at a corrupt or unenlightened
leader.

The third misconception is a very
emotional one which has appeared iii

emany regimes of oppression throughout

history. This misconception is express-
ed by the statement that "those who
wish to manifest their immaturity by
wearing silly black armbands are not
needed as we get together to put this
country back on track. Here the
author is assuming that there are sec-
tors of the public who deserve to be ex»
cluded irom the political arena and that
there is actually someone tperhaps the
author himself) who is worthy ot'detei'—
mining Just who is allowed to para
ticipate in the political process. ' his is
a very easy misconception to tall into
when one imds onesell tempted by it
taste oi political power. It is always
necessary to remember. however, that
the pendulum of political power is con:
stantly in motion and should one group
provide the necessary tools at oppres-
sion to exclude a group irom participa-
tion the next swing at the pendulum

Last week a DSUC plan at protest

However. the manner in which the.

students chose to demonstrate these

DSOC action

speaking with the recruiter iroiii doing
Sui 1n tact. DSUC s gesture did not
merely inhibit but made it impossible
lor anyone on campus to meet with the
recruiter. According to the report all
least two students had expressed in-
terest in meeting with the recruiter and
were thus deprived 01 their rights to ob-
tain more inlormation and even to exerr
cise an opinion which may have dil»
iered trom DSUL‘ s.

A more constructive plan would have
been to sponsor an alternative iorum or
iniormation meeting more Visible
elsewhere on campus, This way
everyone would have been able to ques-
tion and develop his or her own opinion
