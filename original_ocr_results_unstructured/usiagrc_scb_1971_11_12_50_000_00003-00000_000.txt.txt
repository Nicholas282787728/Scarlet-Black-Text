Enrollment
Report

Out

Scenes like this were commonatRegistrationthis
August, as students and advisors tried to work out
the best possible class schedule under often con-
fusing conditions. The final figures for course en-

rollment were released to the 5513 last week.

Enrollment Sinks In languages

by Craig Murphy

Figures that the Sle received
from the Registrar’s Office indi—
cate that 43% of the courses in
which students have enrolled this
semester are in the division of
social sciences; 34% are in the
humanities, and 23% in science.
The figures indicate no significant
trend away from more difficult
courses since the dropping of res
quired courses and many require»
ments for majors.

The one area of change is foreign
languages. Presently less than one-
fourth of Grinnell’s students are
enrolled in modern foreign language
courses,

The department with the greatest
number of students enrolled is his-
tory. Fully one third oi students
(434) are taking history‘ courses.
Also heavily enrolled are Biology,
Philosophy, and English (with 289,
288. and 234 students respectively).

PelL Problem For Joint Board

by Susan Lindsey

House Presidents discussed pet
regulations, a resident advisor
questionnaire evaluation being done
by the Dean olstudentnllairs office,
ISPIRG, and recent assaults made on
campus women at Monday’s meeting.

Jim Tederman discussed the
evaluation of RA’s being done by
the Counselling Committee. The
questionnaires, given out Wednesday
and Thursday, may be returned to
either the hall presidents or the Dean
of Students. They will serve a dual
purpose: 1) to let each RA know how
he is doing and now he can be of
better service, and 2) to helpdeterr
mine the effectiveness of the pros
gram itself. The results will be taken
into account in reniriug.

Still Lots of Pets

Discussion next turned to the prob—
lem of pets. There has been no de-
crease in the number oipets on cam-
pus since break, and the Joint Board
was faced with the problem of en»
forcement. The general conclusion
reached after lengthy discussion is
that enforcement will be on a com-
plaint basis. ll no complaint is
registered, the pet will be allowed
to remain,

Complaints may be taken to the
nail presidents, whose duty it is to
take care of such complaints, to the
Dean’s ouicc, where a $10 fine may
result, or to Ralph Pomerenk. The
Grinnell Policedepartmentmayalso
impound an animal if a complaint is
registered with them.

A particularly interesting part of
this discussion involved cleaning the
messes made by pets. Jared Van
Wageher asked who cleans up human
vomit. It was stated that the person
who vomited does unless he is physi-
cally unable. Jared then asked who
was to tell who made the mess,
stating, "My dog‘s puke looks just
like mine,”

After lengthy discussion, the Board
decided to leave the meeting time
at 9:00 p.m. on Mondays.

ISPIRG

ISPIRG, Iowa Student Public In-
terest Group, the college version of
Nader's Raiders, was the next item
on the agenda. lnformaticn in the
form of a handout was given to the
hall presidents to post. lSPlRG is
looking for people willing to work
and to help coordinate efforts.

Terry Clifford volunteered that

she was going to talk to Chief
Peters about the assaults made on
five college women in recentweeks.
She was also going to ask about the
rumor that he has been contacted
by the murderer of five lowa women
warning that a Grinnell women was
next.

(The 8&8 discovered later that
Terry had discovered the rumor to
be false, that Chief Peters never
received such a call.)

So far, it appears, the murders are
unrelated. The Board advises stun
dents to keep calm, but take no un-
necessary risks, and to feel free to
call Chief Peters should anything
happen,

Loaded Down

Phil Sasich brought up the fact that
many of the freshmen in his hall
seem to be really loaded down with
work. Discussion following concern—
ing the added amount of work this
semester and its possible relation-
ship to the general emotional de-
pression on campus and the five
attempted suicides reported.

The meeting ended with a report
that in one recent 24-hour period,
7,000 hits of speed were sold on
Grinnell campus.

Sex Education Conference Well Attended

A sex education conference direc-
ted at training personnel in sex
counselling was held on campuslast
Saturday. Speakers from planned
Parenthood assisted the Sex Educa-
tion Committee in arranging the
conference

The session was divided into three
major units, each consisting cla

t0 the student body at large. Both
the morning and afternoon sessions
were well—attended.
According to several students who
participated in the workshop. the

discussions were Surprisingly frank
and uninhibited, There was some
question as to the degree to which
the conference would help counsel-
lors, if at all.

The two groups sponsoringthe cone

ference were The Sex Education

The Conference was taped by KDIC,

How’s that for
variety?

 

 

OIher departments with more than
tworhundred students are Anthroe
polugy (267). PoliticalScience(267),
Psychology (245), Chemistry (242),
Math (229), and Art (zed).

Three departments have less than
onerhundred enrolled. They are
German (63), classics (50), and
physical Education (13). Most pr.
credits are earned in activities,
not in the er. courses, The figure
for the German department is also
distorted because two of the den
partrnent’s three professors are on
leave.

Languages do show less popularity
than other divisions. More students
are taking Russian (166) than any of
the other three languages. French
and Spanish have almost equal en—
rollment(128 and m respectively).

Tutorial Program

Students are taking interest in many
varieties of courses. College offer-
ings, many of which are still geared
to the requirements of past years,
are surprisingly adequate. An exam-
ple of the diversity of interest is
shown in the enrollment in the newly
deslgned tutorial program, required
of every freshman. Almost all fresh
men received One ottheir first three
choices. The only sections with sig

nificantly iewe_r than the average ll
students enrolled are Sociology of
Sport (4), and Man a Science (5).

increasing popularity of some de»
partmentshas meant that they are
understaffed in relation to other
departments with a similar number
of students. This, perhaps, is the
case of the Anthropology department
with only three professors, as com-
pared tO the Similarly-enrolled Pol~
itical Science department with
seven, At least one-third of the An-
thropology courses are taught ona
two~credit basis, so, theoretically,
the number of hours each professor
must spend per class is cut down.

The Philosophy department figures
indicate the same problem, That
department is stalled by six, two of
whom also have responsibilities to
other departments. The Biology de-
partment and English department
have similar enrollment, but nine
and ten members of the teaching
staffs respectively. In fact, there
are nine departments in the college
with fewer students enrolled than
philosophy but with as many or more
instructors.

Threerhundred and four-hundred
level courses are not shunned like
the plague, even with no requirer
merits.

Water Polluters Attacked

Two important new anti—pollution
bills are now before Senate Cnmmlr
ttees as part of a massive wave
of legislation to control pollution of
our waterways.

S. 523-—the “National Water Quar
lity Standards Act of 1971"~would
amend the present Water Pollution
Control Act to allocate an annual
$20 million to State and interstate
pollution control agencies and would
provide an annual $2.5 billion to
underwrite water treatment projects
throughout the country. The bill
would also legislate the establish-
ment of national water purity stan-
dards, which the Environmental
‘ Protection Agency could enforce
with civil and criminal court suits.
Private individuals could also sue
polluters, with EPA picking up the
costs of litigation. Fines for know-
ing water polluters would be set at
$25,000 per day.

S. llJl4--the “Water Quality Stan-
dards and Enforecements Act’5-
would also amend the Water Pol-
lution Control Act to provide fines

up to $25,000 per day for violators of
pollution standards to be established
by the EPA. These siandardswould
be enforced by civil action, not only
[or lakes and streams, but also for
rivers (which pose tricky inter-
state complications), for the conti-
guous zone (armile territorial ocean
boundaries) and for U.S, non-mili-
tary ships operating on the high
seas.

These hills represent unusual long»
range environmental concern on the
part of our legislators. Their
enactment would grant the EPA
far-reaching powers to prosecute
polluters and to put an end to the
poisoning of our waterways.

LEAP urges students to write their
Congressmen urging support of
these bills. Please address all
concerned correspondence con—
cerning S. 523 and S. 1014 to your
Senator, Senate Office Building, Wae
shington, DC. 20025.
