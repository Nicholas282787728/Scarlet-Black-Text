Half a world away from family, Chinese
Studies prof adapts to life at Grinnell

by Lisa Ferguson

The ﬁrst time I met Zheng-
guo Zhang was at party at Chi-
nese House. The house had a
good number of people dancing.
drinking, and conversing with
one another. and Zhang was
standing there by the spiked wa—
termelon talking to a fellow
house occupant When I found
out that Zhang was occupying
Chinese House with about nine
students -- some of whom actu-
ally study the language —- I worv
ried that he might be a little dis-
tressed with his living situationr
After all, he is here for a whole
year. But I talked to him brieﬂy
at the party and afterwards
discovered that he actually enjoys
living with the interesting array
of students,

"I like to stay with them [the
students] and observe American
students and culture. I also think
it‘s a good way for these students
to learn the Chinese language,"

Zhang teaches second- and
third—year Chinese courses at
Grinnell He is here as part of a
ﬁve- year teaching exchange be—
tween Grinnell College and Natt-
jing University The program
sends two recent graduates of
Grinnell to teach English at a
middle school near Nanjing Uni-
versity while the college receives
a Nanjing professor to teach in
the Chinese studies department.
The program is in its third year.

Zhang's teaching at Grinnell
has gone smoothly, but he said,
"My biggest problem here is that
there aren't enough reference
books“ as there would be in a
larger city. "Most of the students

the language.

For the past six years. ﬂlang
has taught Chinese to English-
speaking students. However,
Grinnell is Zhang's first experi»
ence teaching and living in the
United States. "I left Shanghai
and came directly to Grinnell. 1
may have stayed in Los Angeles
for 50 minutes, but Grinnell is
the first American town I have
stayed ill for longer than that."

I assumed that Zhang studied
English in college "No, no.“ he
replied "I taught myself how to
speak English When l was in
college at the University of
liartg- xi (pronounced Jung- -she)
there weren‘t enough books or
teachers to teach English; you
had to learn on your own I
wanted to learn English just be-
cause it was a useful tool to
learn; it let me learn more
things." So, with the help of a
few books and some language
tapes, Zhang literally taught
himself a foreign language. He
speaks English considerably well,
though Zhang admitted, "I make
many mistakes."

Growing up in China gave

at learning

~Zhang a set of values different

from those of most Grinnell
College students. He grew up
during llte cultural revolution in
China when the educated, often
economically established people
were to learn the hardships of the
peasant farmers. "I grew up in
Shanghai, and when many edu-
cated students graduated from
high school, they were sent out
into the countryside to receive a
're-education' from the poor and
lower middle-class peoples. The
country, for the ﬁrst year, gave
those sent away enough money
to live off of while learning the
life of the peasant. The second
year we worked in the fields,
plowing. planting. and tilling the
soils. 1 was in the countryside
for nine years. until 1978. when I
went to the University of liang-
xi, which is about the same size
as 0Grinncll. But I worked myself

From Iiang-xi, Zhang went on to
leach Modern Chinese to native
students (theequivalent of Amer- ‘
icans taking English classes) at
Nanjing and then to teach Chi—

studying ahead

As part of the exchange pro

for only a year, then he will re
turn to Nanjing University, "i
will not go anywhere else to
teach, such as in another foreign
country. Nor will I go back to
China into another career, I will
go back to my regular job.
Rarely do the Chinese move oc~
cupations. They tend to stay at
the same work all of their lives."
He also will be returning home
to his wife and ﬁve-year-old son.

called them once since I've been
here, and I've sent a tape of my
work to them. but that is it,"

Until then. Zhang remains a
student of American culture at
Chinese House. and the students
there have a very special friend

French decided to make the
