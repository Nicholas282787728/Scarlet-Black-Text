‘Ncw campus group forms to
improve campus rape policy

By Craig Wacker

Out of the anger and frustration
surrounding the Grinncll College
sexual abusepolicy has sprung anew
organization called Change and My
ticc, dedicated to placing Grinnell on
the “cutting edge” in sexual abuse
cducalioti and judicial process.

Currently,thegroupis dividedinto
two subcommittees. One is dealing

tions which came out of

with the issue of changing college
sexual abuse policies, the other with
increasingcampus-wideeducationon
tape. The group, now around fifty
members strong. is completely sepa-
rate from other campus groups. Al-
though aided by groups such as Po-
litically AciiveFeministAllianceand
Men StoppingRape,ChangeandJuse

lice has managed to draw individuals
not previously involved in reform-

oriented campus groups.
Thegroup’s agenda,according to
spokesperson Heather Hetmbuch, in-
volves “tzdslng suggestions which
came out of the open forum and pri-
oritizing them.“ She added that the
group |S now “deciding what is vie
able to ask for and what is not." This
process, stated Heimbuch, has been
facilitated by “likemindednoss”
among group members. l-leimbuch
enumerated some of the concerns
expressed by Change and Justice.
“The system is consistent tn its
shortcomings,” said Heimbuch. “It’s
frustrating for everyone who goes
through it” added Heimbucli.
Hcimbuch, along with group mem-
ber Scott Muskin, specifically men-
tioned concerns with the training re—
ceived by Presidential Hearinganrd
members concerning sexual abuse.
Heimbuch stated that in her dealings
with the Hearing Board last year,
inappropriate questions had been
asked, leading herand Carla Parry to
recommend training of Board meme
bers. She added thatsimilarmistakes
weremadeinacasethisyear,butthat
“this Lime. they knew enough to rcale

izc that they had asked an inappropri-
atequestion and apologized profusely
for having done so." Muskin recalled
thatBoard members werein factgiven
a workshop at the beginning of the
year, covering pertinent issues. He
added, however, that to his memory,
the workshop was only three hours in
length.

Both Heimbuch and Muskin were
also concerned wilh the training of
Resident and Student Advisers.
Heimbuch stated: ”we‘re looking at
increasrngthequantityand ihequality
of the training."

Heimbuch and Muskin also called
for the hiring of a rape counselor. a
specialist available to students 24
hours a day. Additionally, they rec-
ommend campusewide announce-
ments of all harassment and rape inci-
dents reported io Student Affairs.

Heimbuch stated that if Change
and Justice’s recommendations were
implemented, the resulting policy
would be “as progressive, and as fair,
and as useful as is humanly possible."
Muskin added: “And I honestly be-
lieve that that is Student Affairs's
goal as well."

Student Affairs explains stance

By Craig Wacker

After the open~forum on rape. the
Office of Student Affairs has made a
bid to clarify its stance on the issue.

“It‘s imponantfor students to un-
derstand that we‘ re very open to look-
ing at these policies,” said Dean of
Student Affairs Tom Crady, who ex-
pressed a desire to solicit student in-
put on College policies dealing with
rape and sexual abuse. He added that
the College had introduced changes
in response to suggestions made last
year.

Oneof the primary policychangcs
proposed by Crady is better clarifica-
tion of the options available to com~
plainants in Presidential Hearing
Board cases. This will involve closer
discussron of campus, police and le—
gal procedurcs, Additionally. com-
plainants now have another 48 hours
to review the written statement fur~
nished by the defendant.

Crady also announced alterations
to the Presidential Hearing Board.

Cases which qualify for the Hearing
Board are now explicitly written in
tthtudentHaadbook.Hestated that
the Office of Student Affairs‘ place
in the Hearing Board has changed
from an observing to advising role.
He added that the actual Hearing
Board proceedings have been revised
to facilitate the process.

Questioned on student concern
over therape issue,Crady said that“l

really feel like we’re fairly open in
doing what we can to address it.“ He
advocated the creation a studenteade
minisuativccommitteetoaddressstu»
dent needs. “Students have to be in-
volved in the process,” said Crady.
Student Affairs would be “open to
getting it going right away." Mem-
bers of the committee would most
likely be appointed by the College
President.

PC report completed

By Chris Maag

The report summarizing student
views on political correctness atGrine
nell has been completed, and will be
made public sometime next week. It
is the product of last year's Social
Methods of EmpiricalResearchclass’
group project, and is based on a sur-
vey sent to students last April and
May that asked student opinions on
sexism, racism, homophobia, the en—
vironment.poverty,and abortionThe
survey also asked people’s percep-
tion of the views of other students,
and personal questions about things

Theresults of thesurvey show that
Grinnell students have a grwt deal of
agreement on politically correct is-
sues. Mostofdiedisagreements seem
to arise over how strongly they sup-
port a given issue. However, 71%
criticize political correcmess and its
reputation for intolerance and of be
ing too chSeeminded.

“On the whole, we were suprised
there was this much consensus on the
‘PC line‘." said Sociology Professor
Kent McClelland, who teaches the
researchclass.“Butpeopleseemedto
be very suspicious of political cor-
rectness per se... and there really
doesn't seem to be as much tolerance
and respect for others ideas that you
would expect in a group where the
level of agreement is so high."

Roughly 30% of the 944 students
responding to the survey were classi-
fied as having strong PC positions.
10% were classified as having strong
positions against politically correct
beliefs, and 60% were in the middle.
The middle range, however, did tend
towards the PC side of the spectrum.
(See figure at top) Criticism ofpoliti-
cal correctness itself was common
however. 79% agree that most people
unihinkingly accept politically cor-
rect positions on issues.

Students who are very PC in their
beliefs tend to be more active in po-
litical groups, more critical of the
opinions of other students, and more
comfortable talking about their own
political beliefs. 87% of those 5“,,

dents classified as very PC feel com-
fortable talking about their beliefs on
issues.

Students who are not PC tend not
to belong to political groups, and do
not feel comfonable talking about
their political views. Only 50% of
those classiﬁed as not PC feel com-
fonable talking about their own be-
liefs.

“There is a pretty common idea
that PC has a tendency to silence
other views. This looks like some
evidence that that‘s happening,” said
McClelland.

20% of North campus said they are
very PC. 30% of south campus said
they are very PC, and 51% of those

in all the groups ordered by race,
