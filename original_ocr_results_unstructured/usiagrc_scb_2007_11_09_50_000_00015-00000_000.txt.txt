Their finest hour: Wild Turkeys water polo second at nationals

BVABBVRAPOPORT

The speech Brian Smith 09 We to his
water polo teammates at nationals last week-
end was a speech for the ages. The words were
inspiring and movinggbut they weren’t his.
Smith chose Winston Churchill’s “We Shall
l-‘Ighr Them on the Beaches" speech circa 1940
to lead his team to victory. Smith’s ironic and
seemingly random speeehes (he does Boromir
and Aragorn from The Louie/1}]: ngr, we)
just illustrated the fun yet hardworking atti-
tude that led Grinnell's Wild Turkeys to sec-
ond place in nationals.

In addition, three team members made Allr
America teams, and coaches All Titiz ’08 and
Zach Wegerman ’08, both whom doubled as
team captains, also won Coaches ofthe Yeari
an impressive feat since they were the only stu-
dent coaches ofthe top national teams

After reaching nationals rhrcc years ago,
the team has been striving to return since then,
and this season culminated with Grinnell
clinching a nationals spot

“As soon as we won conference Ali [Tltiz]
said, ‘Were going to nationals, I'm proud of
you, regardless ofhow we do,"’Max Stephcrr
son '10 said.

Titiz’s determination to get to nationals
stemmed not only from his competitive edge,
but from a desire to make up tor a disappoint-
ing performance during his ﬁrst year. Titiz
played with a torn abdomen, and the team did
not play up to expectations, ﬁnishing ﬁfth out
of six teams In all, it was characterized as a
fairly miserable experience.

This season, the approach was different,
“We said one of our goals is going to be (0
make it to nationals and actually have ﬂan."
said Titiz.

The Wild Turkeys work hard to train and
reach new players, as only two or three new
players come in wrrh experience each season
But these differences can be overcome through
practice, as evidenced by Titiz and chers

Titiz came to Grinnell as a member of
the Turkish Junior National Water Polo team,
while Wegerman’s only experience with the
sport came from informal play, making that
his ﬁrst trip to nationals (and third tourna-
ment ever) was “scary as hell.”

Underwater, the battle continues outside of
the referee’s eye.

“You can't really prepare somebody for be
ing held in the water and getting punched in
the face," Wegerman said. To deal with the
inevitable combat ofa match, Wegetman also
noted that players generally wear two swim
suits since one often
gets ripped in under—
water ﬁghts for the
ball.

Despite these halt
ards, the team rolled

But no one was sad about the team's pcrs

team was reasonably marched.

part to support those who were. “We had a lot
of really good guys who did a really good job
contributing to the team even if they weren't in
the water,” Smith said. “The bench keeps you
in the game.”

The team had support in the stands as well.
Family members came from as far as Seattle to
cheer on the team.

“To have parents and fans cheering {or you
after every play is motivat-
ing and uplifting,"Weger-
man said.

The team’s triendly
attitude also carried them
through nationals, cause
ing rivals University of
Chicago and Tufts to root
for the Wild Turkeys in
the final. “Scifgovernanc:
works,”Titiz said. "even in water polo"

The team stayed with families of two play-
ers, and at nights the whole team, families and
players, would get together for pasta dinners.

“Ifa team doesn’t have [a] bond, It's hard
for them to do anything together,”Smith said

But Smith has other things to worry about
now thar the season's over. "I probably have
to start planning [my speeches] now," he said.
"But they’re usually last minute."

After 20 years, Wallace steps away from the sidelines

BY DRAKE BALLEW

As Saturday’s 16-13 overtime loss to Beloit
College drew to a close, both a season and an
era closed with it, but probably not as retiring
head coach Greg Wallace would have liked.

ironically, in his ﬁnal Pioneer football game
as head coach, Greg Wallace barely had time
to reﬂect. "The game was so tight and such a
nail~biter the whole way,I never had a chance
to think about anything else." he said,

Though Wallace may not have given
thought to its signiﬁcance, the players, cspce
cially the seniors, were well aware that Wallace
would not be back next season.

“His last game we all knew [its signiﬁ-

cance]," said running back Todd Doleshal ’08. '

Grinnellians weren‘t the only ones aware.
“After the game, each team lined up in its end
zone and the Beloit athletic director honored
coach Wallace,” Doleshal said, “it was pretty
special.”

After four quarters of productive football,
the Pioneers had amassed 351 offensive wrds
and were moving the chains well. But with
the ball on the Beloit threevyard line and four
plays to score, the Pioneers stalled and couldn’t
send off Wallace with a victory.

“We just killed ourselves," says Nick Merks
lin '08. “We ran the ball well all day but when
we got in their territory, they mixed some stuff
up on defense and we just couldn't get in."

With nine seconds left, the Pioneers settled
for a ﬁeld goal to force overtime. Beloit kicked
a 21-yard ﬁeld goal on their ﬁrst possession,
which the Pioneers could not match.

“Not getting the win was tough because
you don't want to go out With a loss, whether
it’s me or the senlors," Wallace said. “But gch
Beloit credit. They put themselves in position
to win and capitalized."

Such class has been a steadfast characterise
tic ofWalliIce’s zoeycnr career,

“He’s a standup guy," notes Metklin.“He’l.l
be the ﬁrst one to give someone else credit
when they deserve it, 1r just shows how much
ofa class act lie is. how long he’s been around.
everything he stands for."

While Wallace will be moving on to the
Grinncil College athletic director position
full-time, but still keeping a close eye on foot
balls progress, the seniors face the end oftheit
football careers.

"Taking the ﬁeld with these guys it's
been the best four years of my life," remarks
Ben Westfeldt ’08.

Playersnirncdsassistanrncoach Nate Lind-
sey’08 quit playing football two years ago, but
has stuck around with the team. “I knew this
day would come sometime when the camara-
cleric wouldn't be over but the guys, the play»
ing. would be over," Lindsey said.

But for the remainder of the team, the
focus Is on next year to improve on a dlSﬂpT

pointing 1-9 ﬁnish this year. The remainder of
the team, and even Wallace, is already looking
ahead to next year. After the game, it seemed
like even Wallace wasn't ready for it to end,
speaking of his team like he would still be pace
ing up and down the sidelines as their leader
next season.

“It's a great group oryoung guys," he said.
“We've just got to keep that core of kids to-
gether and add another solid group of recruits
next year and they’ll be fine, they’ll be very
good."

Perhaps the greatest testament to Wallace's
career was his seniors’ postgame comments.
Like so many others, when asked what he Will
remember about Wallace Doleshal responded
“Im going to remember him when he called
me {our years ago, telling me about Grinnell
College. If It wasn't for him, I never would
have come best decision of my life."
