SGA and Charity

A Good
Start, But...

The lrubtees'decision to divest their holdings
in MGM/United Artists is a welcome first step
towards bringing Grinnell's fiscal practices into
line with its professed standards of morality.

It is, however, just that: a first step.

The investment in question is $10,840 wrap-
ed up in the South African home video rnarhet.

ompared to the size of the rest of the college‘s

hueslmen: portfolio, that’s a pretty small surn,

ince this initial diveslmenl will have no
igni/icunt effect on Grinnells financial stan
.ing, it is more of a symbolic action than
.nything ebe.

The specific provisions 0/ the resolution pass-
ed list May might, in /act. confine all
divestment; to the symbolic level.

One section a] the resolution states that the
Trustees will not divest any holdings whose loss
they deem harmful to the College's financial
wellrbeing. In other words, they will
dissocrocire themselves from undesirable ﬁrms
as long as it doesn’t hurt.

So what will happen ilo firm the college has
more substantial holdings in is found to be in
violation of the Sullivan accords? The wording
i f the resolution allows the trustees to continue
winess regardless of human rights considemv
ions.

As (said, we’ve made a start. But ii true test
I the Trustees' resolve to yet to come.

After two weehr, the results of our readers‘
survey are in. Our statisticians haoe reviewed
the four survey forms returned and drawn the
following conclusions:

Readers expressed o strong interest in weekly
columns, with 75% favoring more columns in
the paper,‘ 25% expressed no opinion on the sub
em, but wanted Kyle Torhe’s "Corn/i5”
Philosophy” to return to print.

Hall of the group surveyed would blue to see
serial [lotion in the S 523. Interestingly. 25% of
the survey group ashed specifically for ”The
Tales of Trio and Elba." which appears for the
first time in this issue. Since this figure may
well be solely comprised of lhe author of the
"Tales," we chose to discount il.

How-to articles fared worse in the survey,
with only 25% of the survey group favoring
such /eatures, bully hal/ of the sample group,
moreover, opposed the printing of how-lo
stories,

All [our respondents added more general cone
mentr to their survey forms. The comments "I.-
cluded a vote of confidence, on odmoni 'on not
to fight with SGA through the paper — and on
xpmssion of concern over student apathy.

Imagine thal.

During the last week, we received several un-
signed letters to the editor, As with profes-
xianal publications, we will not print
anonymous letlers. I/ the authors of the letters
we have already received will identify
themselves, we will print their comments in the

Last week in SGA, Finance Committee,
chairman Russ Matteson introduced a by-
law stipulating that. “SGA may not
allocate monies to charities, scholarships,
loans and other non-student programming
requests,” Finance Committee has made
it a practice not to allocate money to
charities and wanted this to be written into
the constitution They claimed that the
proposal was not intended to limit charity.

——
The debate on the proposal began with

the reading aloud of a letter from Presir
dent Drake to former SGA president Matt
Golden which had been forgotten since last
May. Drake’s letter said that Student. ac-
tivities money was meant to be used for
student activities, that other student
governments had been sued for donating
such money to charities, that the Iowa
State Code in fact forbade such use. and
that he was prohibiting SGA from donating
$500 to the Ethiopian Relief Fund, Drake
added that he did not Want to discourage
the “charitable spirit” in which the dunes
lion had been approved.

The issue sparked a long and heated
debate. Before much had been said. the list
of speakers had grown long. Supporters
were sometimes even' more vociferous
than the opposition, which was unable to
produce reasons for defeating the bill.
After defeating motions to table the issue
until next week and to make it an “impor
tant question" requiring two-thirds ap—
proval, the bylaw passed by a margin oi
approximately fourteen to three.

The question posed by the bylaw,
whether SGA was right to use sludenls’
money for charity, was pretty much decid-
ed by Drake's letter. Underlying that lssue
was the more emotional issue of SGA'S
righf to make charitable donations at all.

No one has questioned the virtue Of
charity. Drake apparently hopes that SGA
keeps its “charitable spirit". A Finance
Committee member has Said “donation is
a moral choice”. The basis of a few
senators for opposing the bylaw in vain
was the desire to preserve SGA’s option to
make Charltable contributions, They felt
that the byrlaw closed the door a little bit
more on charity,

The question which faces SGA now is
how. or it. it will legitimately donate to
charitable causes. Finance Committee.
concerned with proceduralism, did not ad
dress this issue, which perhaps explains
why some senators found the bylaw so
unsettling.

As the bylaw approached its second
SGA session, required for adoption into the
constitution, my senator called a hall
meeting to discuss the issue and a propos-
ed amendment to it. Should SGA donate to
charities? And is so, how? Should SGA
charly be a referendum issue? Our loud
discussion centered on these topics. We did
not resolve our argument, but some points
are worth summarizing here.

Some opposed SGA giving money to
charllles because the money Should be uSV
ed for Student activitles. SGA was set up
they argued. for the purpose of taking care
of student activities. A copy at the constitu-
tion was fetched 7 it said nothing about
student actvitles in the section on the “0137
ject” of student government.

SGA should not give money to causes or
which we do not approve, said another
argument. They felt that such a donation
would be a statement of their approval.

Proposed donations should be decided by
the referendum, not SGA. Some even
argued that it even a single student disapr
proved. the donation in question could not
be allowed.

The two issues in question are how to
deﬁne “student money" and what are its
proper uses. and who has jurisdiction over
it. ll is generally agreed that student
money should be used in the interests of
the student body. ll so, using student
money to set up a scholarship fund for
American Indian students would be
legitimate.

A further question is from what sources
can SGA legitimately make charitable
donations. Refrlgeralor rent and pinball
money are not mandatory fees paid by all
students. The justification that money
must be used for student interests because
the money comes from all students cannot
be used in this case.’

The proposed amendment concerns this
issue. The Iowa Code prohibits organiza-
tions from using mandatory fees paid by
its constituents for purposes other than
what was intended, Le. student activities
fees (currently slozl can only be used [or
student activities. .not charities. This
makes illegal donations from the man
datory studenl activities ices we all pay,
The amendment would allow non-
mandatory fees and monies, such as pin-
ball revenue, to be donated to charity,

The amendment would make some funds
legally available for charity. Signs would
have to announce the use of pinball money
on the machines, true, But the only
obstacle to such use is SGA'S rules, for
which students are ultimately responsible.

Given that charitable contributions can
be legal, only the moral question remains.
The same Finance Committee member
who said that charity is a moral cholce
says that SGA should not be involved in
charity “In any way," Since SGA is a
political body. he argues, it. should remain
“amoral." Evidently. he means SGA is or
should be incapable of making moral decl-
smns.

Moral questions cannot be evaded by ig-
noring them; we cannot retreat into “amr
morality." To ignore the question of Charla
Ly, once it is present, is to choose not [D be
charitable. And the fact is: SGA is already
lnvolved in charitable activity insofar as it
sponsors the FOG Fast.

Perhaps he meant that so many conﬂio
ting opinions could not be settled fairly, so
SGA Should avoid Lhe issue entlrely. Con-
rllci of opinion does not mean that we
should paralyze ourselves. SGA does not
work norvcan it Work on the principle of
unanimity.

There ls the fear that money Wlll be
given to undesirable charities. examples
unknown. SGA should not be allowed to
make the decision. the students should.
And if the students cannot agree, than none
may receive charity.

It was Suggested that SGA could flnd ex
pression for its charitable spirit by renting
pinball machines to organizations which
applied for charitable aid. This is not
charity; SGA would be no more Charitable
by annexing the rights to bake sales in the
Calieehouse and then charging commis-
Slon to these rights. Certainly, SGA serves
charity better by doing more than this,

Is the issue of charity so important that
it must be taken out of SGA's hands and
put to referendum? Perhaps, We want In
avoid forcing morality upon others. Should
even a single “no" stop a donation irom
being made'l It we treat ‘it like a refererlr
dui-u issue, the majority will decide. The
burden of proofgliesﬂon those who insist
upon unanimity.

The question is or jurisdiction 7 is SGA
making a statement for students by ap
proving a donation? 7 and touches on the
more fundamental issue of SGA’S role as a
representative body of the students. This
question has been asked for some time
now, at least two years, and still needs to
be answered.

There is also the idea that because it is
student money, it should be used for
students, Just because money is available
[or our use does not mean that it should not
be used for charity. that it is not “right" to
use it for others. That money is used at our
discretion. what is not “right” is absolving
ourselves of all responsibility to others. to
genuinely worthy causes,

SGA is in position to make charitable
donations on behalf of the student body.
There should be a way {or SGA in make
charitable contributions but of the money
it has at hand. Legitimate sources for
charity can be found, We can restrict the

”amount of donations to an acceptable level

and causes can be found which are accepr
table to virtually everyone. To eliminate
this option completely can only be justified
by pure selﬁshness, not by even enlighten
cd selilntcresl. Causes which present
themselves to us deserve our considera-
tion We should not count on others to do
what we Can do.

postscript. The amendment did not
come up for vote but the bylaw, once
dclcaled. must be reintroduced and pass

. two consecutive meetings.

The SGA budget. pools money train all
sources and does not keep track of where
this money comes lrom. This raises again
the legal issue, The administration. in its
talks with Finance Committee. has given
the impression that legal difficulties make
charltable donations out of the SGA budget
impossible:

Finance Committee currently thinks it
too difficult to account the budget so that it
becomes certain that charitable donations
are drawn from legitimate sources, Keep-
ing the door open tor SGA charity means
finding good accounting methods. Finance
Committee has sald it will meet with Bob
Towner-Larsen and see what it can work
out.

The whole issue was raised in December
'34 when Matt Golden proposed donating a
portion of a rare surplus of SGA funds to
the famine Victims in Ethiopia via IOWA
CARES or another Such organization. The
proposal passed SGA unanimously and
without abstention; there was even a men
t‘mn to double the amount, which passed. I
do not remember what happened with the
money Voted to that cause, but it did set us
thinking. It established a precedent.

l was present and voted for the donation
along with the others, It. made us all feel
good. it was something dillerenl from the
usual hassles in SGA, It seems Strange £07
day to think that that donation would now
be opposed because ll. might be lllegal, It is
even more disilluswmng to thlnk that it set.
a bad precedent.
