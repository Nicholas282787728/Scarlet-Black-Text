Misunders’randing
‘On Deba’re Topic

Leads Trio Aslray

‘ By Claude Noyes

Professors Baumann and Dun—
ner met last night in a collision
of principles which had nothing
to do with the formally announ—
ced topic of debate. The real
subject under discussion came
closer to a point touched by the
moderator, Dr. Stevens, in his
introduction: ”Is there a place
for the study of International
Relations?"

The superficial aspects of the
discussion revealed a conflict in
personalities, and not much else.
Both parties refused to accept
the stated topic as one valid
for debate. Both favored the
study of International Relations.
though disagreeing as to what
it should be called, Both agreed
that it cannot be studied as a
separate entity, though Dr. Bau-
mann assigned it a relatively
smaller place in the area of hu-
man relations than did Dr. Dun-
ner.

There was, however, much
concrete gain from the debate
of last evening. Those who year-
ned for a straight fight between
the two have had their way,
and should be satisfied A re-
turn engagement between the
two on some of their real and
honest differences of opinion
would be of great interest to
those who would hear a ration.
al conflict of ideas, rather than
one of men. Many subjects bare-
ly touched last night, such as
personal interpretations of his-
tory, or the role of an idealogy
in human relations, would be
excellent topics for debate.

Most of the comment heard
after IRC President Dave Ham-
mer adjourned the meeting was
strongly in favor of future de-‘
bates, if they could be handled
with a greater respect for the
intelligence of the student and—

Earl Peisner Says/
Student Government
Has True Freedom

“When one freedom looses its
fritters, it becomes the fetter of
another freedom,” stated Stun
den Council President, Earl Pies-

morning.

“Being frce in license is not
real freedom. You must also have
a chance for freedom, the
knowledge and understanding of
that freedom, and you ust ova
ercome the responsibi ties at.
tached to true freedom," he said.

Peisner showed how the Grim
nell college student government
exemplifies true freedom, Its
aim is to serve the whole school
by providing the means for Stun
dents to organize as well as a
practical education and demo—
cratic self—government.

He stated, “Freedom does not
stop with the right to elect peo-
ple. it implies and creates re-
sponsibilities which in turn cre—
ate wants and griefs."

Peisner stressed that we can
break some fetters of freedom,
but without God’s help, we can—
not reach our ultimate goal. He
asserted, “Democracy is a gov-
ernment of the eternal principles
of justice; it has taken centuries
to develop this idea of freedom."

Chapel assistants were. DeWitt
Purdue, Langan senior, and Janie
Slichter, Main senior.

“ After increasing our fire in-
surance load a half million dol-
lars you can bet we’ll eliminate
every fire hazard the insurance
companies find," reports Treas-
urer Rupert Hawk.

Engineers of the Insurance
Company of North America are
now completing a thorough sur-
vey of all dormitories and cam-
pus buildings. Einal reports are
expected next month.

”This Survey,” Mr. Hawk went
on, “is part of a full and long
range fire prevention and pro-
tection program conducted by

On January 1. the college car—
ried $1,117,260 fire insurance on
the dormitories. This was increas-
ed to $1,396,575 on April 1. Then
on October 1, it was increased
again to $l,686,300. The survey
was conducted for the purpose
of establishing the new insurance
rates.

Report Misleading

“That fire hazard report of
last spring was very misleading.
No one was really satisfied by
the report,” he commented.

Many of the crl'ti 'sms, he re—

ports, were not criticisms but
were instead recommendations
for fire prevention. One phase
of the report covered inflam—
mable fluids. 1t implied that
dangerous floor oils were being
used in several of the dormitories
and that an approved cleaning
.compound should be substituted.
. “In the dormitories noted, no
oils were ever used because the
floors are tile.”
I Actually. Mr. Hawk states, the
report supposedly exposing a fire
-hazard was merely a recome
mendation that floor oils never
be used on campus buildings.
The report was misconstrued to
’read that a definite fire hazard
existed.

“ As for the fire escapes, every
escape on the campus has been
repaired and, recoated with
aluminum asbestos paint."

New Recommendations

The present survey has offered
many recommendations for pre—
cautionary measures. All rub—
bish is to be kept from col-
lecting and all rubbish chutes
and trash rooms not in use are
to be sealed off to prevent their
use as chimmrleys in case of
fire. Roof doors are to he closed
and fireproofed. Doors to cor.
ridors and stairwells are to re~
main closed.

Main hall has switched from
coal ranges to electricity as a
result of the survey. All over the
college transformer boxes are
being fireproofed and in many
buildings fuse sizes ordered cut
to 15 amps from the 30’s new
in use.

“The investigation last spring
said we had enough of the right
kind of fire extinguishers but
the engineers making the pres-
ent survey say we need even
more," Mr. Hawk said.

He went on to explain that eig—
tinguishers now used are of the
carbon—tetrachloride type. The in.
surance engineers recommend the
addition of several 2% gallon
sodaash extinguishers to each
building.

Empty Dorms Checked

The insurance engineers are
making the second of two build—
ing surveys. Before school opened
they checked to find possible
fire hazard situations when the
buildings were unoccupied. They
returned to see how use in-
creases fire danger.

“An empty building is one
situation, It might be safe when
empty," Mr. Hawk commented,
"But let people put extra loads
on the wiring and throw ashes
into cardboard wasebaskets and
