spent an hour on selfagov, and this time they
seem like they’ve really emphasized that this is
what the community is," said Offenberg,

Offenberg also helped push forward changes to the often
stressful room draw process setting up 'a separate draw for tri-
ples two weeks in advance ofregular drawing, so that students
can plan ahead if they do not get their first choice of housing,
and revising group draws to be based on numbers, rather than
on location.

Beyond his campaign promises, ottenberg has had to tackle
the issue ofsmoiting on campus property. Since Iowa's “Smoke
Free" law passed July this year, effectively banning smoking on
campus propery, complaints about smokers on campus brought
in police officers and a number ofcitations. Offenberg is work-
ing with Facilities Management to reinstate cigarette disposal
bins, also known as Srnoiters’ Outposts, encouraging smokers
to smoke legally, or otfof campus grounds, and to dispose of
the waste properly.

While the cabinet maltes up a large portion ofSGA’s pres-
ence on campus, student senators put in the voice of Residence
Hall Clusters through Joint Board sessions, passing resolutions
and representing the student voice on campus.

oetCampus/Non Campus owned Senator Phil Hagen ’10,
who is serving his 6th semester as a SGA senator, said that
the currentjoint Board is more involved and balanced than in
previous years.

"It’s good because you have those people who are passionate
about certain things, and the other people who aren't so much
passionate about it, and they can give a very logical reason,"

from p. 1.

Hagen said,

Firstesemester senator Kendall Holley '11 echoed Hagen‘s
positive sentiments regarding Joint Board, noting that advo-
cacy of issues was high amongst certain groups, with others
playing a more subdued, moderator role.

“Different parts of campus, who they are and what they do,
they’re very ditrerent on joint Board," Holley said, discussing
the variety of views from different senators focusing on speciﬁc
issues. “You can tell where people have different experiences
with certain things."

However, even with the enthusiasm, the 100 percent pas-
sage rate of proposed resolutions in Joint Board raises questions
as to whether Joint Board is simply a rubber stamping session,
passing anything and everything introduced.

Krey'sa said that even though the statistics show that every
resolution passes, this is because the majority of bills that would
not pass are terminated before they make it to Joint Board.

“Resolutions don't have a very low {ail rate because of the
process they have to go through before they're passed," Krejsa
said. '

Resolutions are given a rwwweek period, after being intro
duced, for discussion and amendments before being introduced
to Joint Board to be voted on,

“Really, if somethings proposed, unless it's absolutely ri-
diculous, we’ll discuss it for a while, and we'll probably agree
on it,"said Hagen.

Student impressions of SGA have been favorable this sea

was a divide between SGA and the school. because I feel like

they did whatever they wanted to, but 1 didn’t have so much
cxpcricnéc with them," said Nikeisha SeweIl '12, “But now I
find that I can talk with them ifI have a problem. Ifit’s some
thing they have done, and I don’t like it, I feel like I can just
say, ‘Hari'y, I don’t like what you did,’and he's not going to be
offended by it. So I’ve had really good experience with SGA."

While several students noted that they were found Krejsa's
presence on campus prolific and helpful, saying that they had
either gone to him with problems or been approached by him
out of the blue, the knowledge of senators was less wide—spread,
With some students noting that they did not know exactly who
their senators were.

"I’ll talit with Harry,” Anh Bill ‘13 said, noting that Krejsa
had been present at her first meetings at Student Alumni Asa
sociation and that her experience with the cabinet had encoura
aged her to become involved in SGA in the near future.
