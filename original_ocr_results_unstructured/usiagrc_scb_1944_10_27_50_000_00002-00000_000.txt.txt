“Intellectual discipline is not enough." So
begins the Grinnell creed, and it goes on to
add that a college should be a “full human
environment” with opportunities for emo-
tional, socialand spiritual, as well as intel-
lectual growth, We respectfully submit for
the attention of the faculty and adminis
tration that in the past two months intel-
lectual discipline has been stressed to the
exclusion of all other phases of campus life

, As students of Grinnell we are proud of
-its high scholastic standing, and we 1ealize
that the student is the basic element ill
Grinnell‘s outstanding system of education
It cannot maintain its reputation as a fine
liberal arts college unless we work, and
work hard But work, like anything, can
be overdone,

Next to the academic program of a
college, its extra—curricular activities are the
most valuable aspect of college life to the

radio announcer may gain experience of
immeasurable value to him and his work,
or a part ill a college play might arouse a
life-time interest in dramatics. All partici-
pation, regardless of its material value, aids
in the social growth to which the creed '1'
fers. Yet participation in eXtYErCLll‘l'lCllh‘

of participation is directly, traceable to the

entirely too much of our “leisure" time.
studying.

College students are expected to be in-
formed on the world stirring events that are
occurrillg daily . . 1 a not unreasonable ex—
pectation, since we are presumably study-
ing to fit ourselves to take a part in this
world which is being carved under our very
nosesr The trouble is that we are turning
up our noses, though not by choice. Faculty
members have on several occasions been
appalled by our ignorance of current events,
but the fact is that we have to spend so
much time in the world of Napoleon and
Caesar that we just can’t schedule Hitlelx

Our part in the war is comparatively
small. Most of the girls on the campus have
war activities, to which they devote two
hours a week. Yet even these are neglected
in the mad rush to keep abreast of the
fast—flying chapters in the text, We skimp
on our sleep, and sometimes miss meals for
the same reason This may sound like ex-
ageration, but it emphatically is not, Such
a situation is far from healthy.

We want to know the reasons, and good
olles, for the increased pressure of our
studies. It seems to us that each professor
is attempting to make his department the
most difficult in college, disregarding any
other assignments that the student may
have In many departments we are as-
signed a full evening’s work for each sub»
ject . 1 and the night just isn’t that long.
Is it that these professors fear that their
courses will become ”snaps?” If so, we

would like to say that if a professor ex-‘

pects two hours work outside of class for
each hour in class, his course is far f1om
a snap, and we have a fighting chance of'
completing all of our assignments for the

next day. Or is it that “they don't have,

anything else to do, keep them busy" school
of thought? We promise that we can find
something to do . . the above mentioned
activities, fo1 instance . . without getting
into too much mischief. We don’t mean to
gripe and grumble because we have to study

We should feel wronged if we didn‘t have
to, but we feel that there would be a health—
ier mental outlook as well as a higher qual
ity of work on campus if the present lop-
sided way of life in Grinnell were corrected,
