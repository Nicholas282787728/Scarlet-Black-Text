The idea ferJainnerty came from
Amnesty International, which pro-

provides hints for planning them.

went into booking Over the Rhine for
the event. Their dreamy. soaring mus
sic has made them popular in the Cin-
cinnati mustc scene, and the band
members are vocal supponers of Am-
nesty.

Amnesty members wanted to put
on the festival because more than any
other activities they could have done,
they felt Jamnerly would get their
message out to the public and make
students aware ofwhat is going on. “I
love being in Amnesty international
and doing thingslike this because I get

This, and the memory on his computer,

performance.

Although shamed by a four-song
repetoire, Eli'pmn ﬁlls animponantplace
as Grinnell's only industrial band. Darr
was prompted to take his music solo
when he couldn‘t ﬁnd a campus band
iharwas interested in pursuingelectronic
music.

‘The instrument I play is key
boards." said Darr. "l'hat automatically
disqualified me from playing in most
bands becausealot of them havean idea
of what sound they want and it means
absolutely no keyboards allowed. I felt
that [electronic] music should be ex-
posed to other people if i was the only
one. and ifother people were interested
then that shouldbeaniche thatshouldbe
ﬁlled."

Darr sull struggles with maintaining
Eli‘pwrt as an industrial band. He often
feels limiied by hIS equipment. which
does not accomodale all of the sounds he
wouldlikc. ”My vision ofwhatEIipron is
is trying my damdest to be creative and
still stay within the realm of being indus
trial, which is hard to do with the equip
mom I have.” he said.

Darr, ‘That's lcind of a typical industrial
approach. Then I kind of got into the
humorous side ofthings."

Elipioii will perform at the HUM
Showcase at The Que in Iowa City next
week (see photo. frontpage). The band‘s
music will also appear on the upcoming
CD of Gnnnell bands. entitled Doze.
