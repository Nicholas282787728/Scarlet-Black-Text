10/10 party, Parents'
Weekend on same day

. Students wonder about coincidence

As the second weekend of October nears, Grinnell students
have something to look forward to on Saturday. This weekend
Grinnellians will nor just be consuming alcohol and music in
large amounts, they will also be entertaining their parents

The fact that parents’ weekend 'coincides with 10/ 10 has
been a bone of contention for the last several years. As this year
will mark the second year in a row that the dates have coincided,
some students are even starting to wonder if the scheduling is
intentional.

“I think it was absolutely planned,” said Whitney Knopf
'09.“1’m pretty impressed by the coordination. 1 think parents

~ will get a closer view of what their students’ lives are actually
like, which will deﬁnitely perturb some people."

Knopf added that her parents will not he vi iting campus,
mainly because she will “be seeing them in a week anyway,“

Family weekend includes activities such as a President's
breakfast, a Concentration fair and several familyeoriented pere
formances. Vice-president of College and Alumni Relations

Mickey Munley ’87 said that Parcnts’ Weekend is planned with _

conﬂicts in mind. In the past, the planning committee has tried
to avoid conﬂicting family weekend with events such is Jewish
holidays, the beginning ofthe school year and trustee weekends.
Despite student protest, however, he says that there is really “no
rhyme or reason” to the scheduling, other than trying to avoid
major events

“We dont look at [1o/1o], "Munley said. Its yust the way it
turns out Grinnell' is a campus with a lot of things going on all
the time and everyone tries to schedule the best they can.”

Though many student complaints blame deliberate admin—
istration planning for the conﬂicting dates of the 10/10 Party
and Family weekend, Munley said that he appreciates the
questions,

“It’s great that people are concerned because it shows they/re
interested in having their folks show up," he'said.

R ASK-THE PLRE’sI

What was the most important thing to
come out Of this last trustee meeting?

I thought the most important thing was their review of the
implementation of the strategic plan and the discussing ofbudget-
ing for it. These decisions, when completed, will affect the College
for five year and set rhe course during this period including adding
new faculty and enhancing the curriculum of the College.

Student rabbi
not permanent

Rabbi, cant. from p. 1

job description, said that the new position is more
ﬂexible. “What we need to do is be as ﬂexible as we
can so we can attract people with a wide range of
interests," he said.

Shorb had hoped to hire a permanent rabbi
before the High Holidays, but when it became ap»
parent that the position would not be filled by the
deadline, she hired DariaJacobs.

“I don't think we’ll have a rabbi until next year,
which makes it difﬁcult to do things like High Hole
idays," Baker said. "Dana’s done a great job, but it’s
been very difﬁcult to coordinate.”

Jacobs, a rabbinical student, will be in Grinncll
during the High Holiday period and lead Rosh Han
shanah and Yom Kippur services.

Jacobs is studying in Israel for two years as part
ofhe. seminary program, so Grinnell ﬂcw her to the
us. using money from its operating budget. Jacobs
arrived Sept. 30 and will be on campus unnl Oct.
14. In addition to leading Rosh Hashanah and Yom
Kipput services, she will make guest presentations in
classes, lead programming for Chalutzim and other
organizarions and be available (or appointments
with students who have questions or want to talk.

Students are concerned that losing the associate
chaplain position, in addition to making the job less
attractive. damages campus religious life.

“It's not just Jewish students," said Baker. “Not
having an associate chaplain affects a lot of groups
on campus.” Brin served as a liaison to the Pagan,
Orthodox Christian and Hindu groups, and the
new rabbi would not perform those duties.

“we have so many different kinds of religious
communities, and they’re so diverse that they need
individual assistance and attention from a uniﬁed,
coordinated ofﬁce," said Baker.
