Town residents
on the election

When sitting in class or the dining hall,
Giiiinell students will typically be aware ot'rlie
political leanings ofthe person sitting next to
them, But the political ideas of another sign
niricant portion of the local clectcriitc may be
largely a mystery.

The SEE interviewed local residents and
business owners in downtown Grinnell to
learn what politica issues are most impoitant
in evaluating candidates, Those interviewed
spoke primarily on the presidential race be
tween Senat s John McCain and Barack
Obama and the local State House race be-
tween Republican Danny Carroll and incum-
bent Democmt Eiic Palmei.

Like most Americans. Grinnell voters ex*
pressed concern over general hotsbutton issues
such as the war in Iraq, taxes, and healtlicare.
“Being a small business petson,ptobably one or
the big Concerns that I have is that the health-
catc for my wife and l,we have [0 privately buy
that and if I have to do healthcare for my em-
ployees, that's a big concern that I have” said
City Councilmembcr At Large James White.
White, who owns Bates Flowers, also cited the
war in iraq and what he viewed as unwarrank
ed tax breaks for the wealthy

Lcslec Porath, a manager at McNally's
grocery store, said that she was planning to
vote and identified her position on more tradi-
tional social issues in deciding to vote for Mcr
Cain. “I just believe rcally strongly in the right
to life," Porath said, “That basically sways my
vote. I do believe in a lot ofthings and a lot of
Democratic ideas but that's one of the main
reasons that i choose to be Republican most
ofthe time."

In local elections, voters also identiﬁed
healthcarc as a top concern. White, for ins
stance, speciﬁcally pointed to medical costs at
Grinnell Regional Medical Center. “We get
paid the lowest rate for Medicare reimburses
ment ofany place,"White said. "Ifour hospital
were in a larger city wed be reimbursed at a
higher rate. And I think that’s sad that we give
quality healthcare in our own time but we’re
penalized because we’re a small place."

Property taxes were another local issue for
Grinnell voters. Attorney and former City
Council Member Peggy Elliot said that the
current tax structure is a failure because of
the comparatively high tax rates levied against
commercial properties. “The biggest thing in
my opinion is the failure of both parties to
achieve property tax reform,” Elliot said.

“Agricultural is advantaged because we
are an agrarian state and residential [taxes are]
rolled back, Where do the taxes land? Com-
mercirtl. And you can end up ruining your
commercial and industrial sector," she said.

As part of his campaign platform, Repubs
lican candidate Danny Carroll said he would
work to lower property taxes. Elliot, however,
said that neither Carroll not Palmer seemed to
present a particularly attractive policy in this
area.

While White said he was concerned about
government tax policy, he was also worried
about government spending, specifically re,
garding teacher salaries. “1 want to keep the
young people of Iowa in Iowa," White smdt
“When you see some of the teacher salaries
in the neighboring states, a starting teacher
makes tivc, seven, 10 thousand dollars more

For those interested in how to deal with
diverse complex problems such as pollution or
crime, the new Policy Studies concentration
might be just what the doctor ordered.

On Oct 6, the faculty of the college ap
proved the creation of the new Policy Studies
concentration, an interdisciplinary concentras
tion aimed at examining how public policies
are made and implemented. In addition to
three new course offerings, a professor spe-
cializing in policy studies will be hired to help
implement the concentration.

According to Policy Studies Chair Bill
Ferguson, Economics, “policy studies is a sys
tematic attempt to try to analyze how policies
are made, how primarily governments deal

Trayless dining placed on the backburner

BY DAVID LOGAN

A trend is sweeping across America as
dozens ofcolleges and universities are remov—
ing trays from then dining halls and asking
students to dine platerinrhand.The idea has
iceently come to Grinnell as administrators
have contemplated the potential for traylcss
dining in the Marketplace.

Those who are calling for trayless dining
aiguc that eliminating trays can reduce food
waste and remove cleaning costs associated
with the trays. By eliminating them, students
will take less food and waste less,

“Proponents of trayless dining have said
that it is more environmentally friendly, that it
creates less waste, and saves water and electric
ity that had to be used to wash the trays,"said

Director of Dining Services Dick Williams,
The true goal is that going trayless makes peos
ple waste less food and therefore wastes less
money on food costs,"

A 2008 study conducted by ARAMARK,
a national food services company, showed that
schools which eliminated trays saw a 25 to 30
percent reduction in food waste while saving
schools an average ofnearly $60,000 a year. By
sonic estimates, cleaning a single tray can use
up to a lmlfrgallon or water. serving roughly
2,500 meals daily, Grinnell Dining Services
could save well over 1,000 gallons of water a
day ifttaylcss dining was implemented.

That same study also reported that ot
79,000 students sutvcycd from 300 olleges and
universities across the country, 79 percent sups

that in the coming year between 50 and 50
percent of its clients will decide to forgo trays,
Dozens are already experimenting with trays
less dining, including the University ofNorth
Carolina, Randolph college, and Brown Uni-
versity.

Despite the national trend, Williams said
the idea is only in preliminary stages and that
keeping the trays can have aditintages. “They
won’t break it they get dropped on the ﬂoor
and help prevent spills and messes," he said

The idea was effectively shelved last week
at a dining committee meetingiat least for
the shortsrerm, According to Dining Hall
