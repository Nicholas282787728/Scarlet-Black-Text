> Faculty Plotting to
' Break Series Tie

by Justin Lincoln
.Last Wednesday. October 2‘3, 1986. the
Girnnell College women‘s volleyball team
defeated Team Faculty in straight games.
1578. 15413. to tie the tworyear old series a
one game apiece, ~

Frank Goodkin. event organizer and
unofficial Faculty coach. attributed the
loss to several factors Most devastating
was a lack of comprehensive knowledge of
the game‘s intricate structure of rules, Apr
parently, last year's game did not include
the presence or an official and consequent-
ly. this year the team was not aware of
many rules. "Next year.” Goodkin said,
“we'll negotiate whether to go back to
Beach Volleyball. Otherwise. we'll have to
get the Faculty team to learn the rules."
One drawback of the latter optlon would be
the necessity for a practice session.

Women's Volleyball Head Coach Cindy
Mueller. who officiated the most recent
contest. agrees with the need for negotiar
tions. “We may have to loosen the rules a
little because they're [Faculty] skill level
isn't anywhere near ours." she said. “It's
like trying to run your soapbox at In-
dianapolis; itjust doesn't work."

The faculty team consisted of Tom and
Emily Moore, Sigmund Barber. Judy
Hutner, Bob Stanis. assistant Volleyball
coach Shagero Yamada, and Goodkin. The
absence oi widespread skill was due large-
ly to attr on of last year's wmning squad.

and agile Mark Xannoiyski. in addition.
will and Evelyn Freeman were unable to
participate because of prior commitments
and an injury.

Gnodkln is optimistic about the future,
however. "I think the raw talent we saw
this year can be developed," he said, He
proposes to concede speed. concentration.
and skill in order to Concentrate on
strategy. He also hopes to extend the
team's height by recruiting Jan
Czechowski and Alex Muffett. "our answer
to Star Wars "

Another alternative may be to disregard
strategy and apply ior Sloan funding to
allow Niemeyer to make a return ap-
pearance for next year's match. in the
likely event that the above eiiorts rail,
Goodkin indicated that the rate of the
Faculty team will probably rest with
nit-hard Cervene's decision to play or not
to play

“Next year's match, to break the series
tie. will undoubtedly be one of the most ex»
citing and competitive events of the 20th
century." Goodkin remarked. in addition
to the loss. the Faculty will be avenging an
occurrence which Goodkin called "a horri~
ble display of party~poopery." This phrase

the elements, as well as Lake Forest.

“It was freezing!” sald one fan who hud-
dled in blankets throughout the two-hour
battle, Besides biting temperatures,
"there was a slight breeze which gave the
team defending the North goal a slight
edge.“ said Pfiﬁch, “We needed to have
scored in_that first half." he continued,
“but didn't get it done "

After a tense hour colored with repeated
incidents of kicking the ball out of bounds,
Grinnell and Lake Forest left the field at
half-time, scoreless. “We had no
knowledge of anybody." explained
Pfitsch. “It took our team the first half to
get adjusted.”
