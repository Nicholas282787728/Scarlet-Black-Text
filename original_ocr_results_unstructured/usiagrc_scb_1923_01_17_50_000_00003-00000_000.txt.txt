fense for Themselves.

Ames, Jan. 16.#Iu their game with‘

the Pioneers Wednesday evening the
Cyclones are expecting to meet one
of the strongest teams in the con»

ference. l

The Ame: fans have conceded Grib-
nell with having the strongest defense
of the two aggregations but according
to experts who saw both limes»
Kansas and Grinnellriktusas games,
Ames has the most powerful olten-
sive machine, with "Pinky" Greene as
the main cog.

Coach Chandler is ﬁguring on a
close battle in Wednesdays game,
and has stated that he feels that the
Grinnell team is far superior as an
experienced outfit, Greene is the
only man on the Ames outfit who
won his letter last year that will
enter the contest Wednesday, since
"Red" Lane has been unable to come
up to the fast pace which has been
set by this years' team.

Raff, who made six ﬁeld goals in
the game against Oklahoma, was un-
ahle to score heavily against the K.
U. outfit, due to his lack of size. The

Vvery enjoyable comedy. Jess Coffer

upon the program for The Des Moines

Theatre prize, was particularly well
done. Sarah Bialla Cohen tool: the

while The Poet was done by John
Normile. Both were in excellent chare

[ticularly capable. A, E. Minetor was

low voice added to the effectiveness
of the fantasy. The lines were subtly
meaningful and deligbtlul and thor-
oughly enjoyable. Miss Laure Mae
Williamson directed the producu‘on.”
