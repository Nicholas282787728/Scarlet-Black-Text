Last Saturday oiir attention Was attracted
to the coming indoor and outdoor track sea-
son by a very successful dinner attended by
over sixty Inellt The dinner was followed
with talks by Stuart Parks and Morgan
Taylor, one of Grinnell’s most famous ath-
lctes, and former world’s champion hurdler.
In these sixty men and other students in
Griltnell there is plenty of material for a
really good track team. Yet, unless ever)
one turns out except those who know abe
sollltely that they have no potential ability
for track, much of this material will be
lost.

Grinilell may ha\e been the underdog ill

placed in such big meets as the Illinois
Relays and the Armour Relays, and the
team has won the Beloit Relays. A few
men such as Morgan Taylor have gone on
to win national and international Challipiolk

than for any other sport. It is ollr job to
keep it well known for th sport.

More than one of Grillilell’s track tith—
