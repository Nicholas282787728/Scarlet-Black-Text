100 Miles

by Fran Crolts

This Wednesday, April 13, five
members from United Neighbors,
lnc. marched through Grinnell to
gain publicity and support (or cur-
rent legislation regarding welfare
retorm. United Neighbors, lnc.
(UNI), based in Davenport, is a
neighborhood committee at
weltare recipients tighting for
welfare reform, Aiter a SIX-day
march, the live marchers plan to
arrive in Des Moines this after
noon. They will be Joined by 50 to
100 other members from the
Davenport area.

According to the marchers, one
of the group's top priorities is an
extension of “greenrcard” medical
benefits for 15 months utter reci-
pients go oil welfare. When
available, greencard benetits pay
only one-half oi the doctors' bills
and do not pay tor medicine. Cur-
rently, these beneﬁts are removed
within several months at a reci-
pient's getting a job and going ott
weltare. One problem is that
employers oiten hire several part-

rtime employees rather than tull-
time ones because they can’t are
tord to give benerits. Then, accor-
dmg to one marcher. “Ii they hire
a tull-time [employee] you're out
of luck.” Many available jobs are
(or minim um wages.

These circumstances make it
harder tor people, especially those
with children, to stay with a job
and oil welfare, According to one
UNI marcher, ”We're not lazy, we

Two Grinnell Seniors
Win Watson Fellowship

i I, .
Lorelei Kelly

No Grinnell seniors, Lorelei
Kelly and Timothy Manatt, have
been awarded Thomas J. Watson
Fellowships tor 1988-89, Grants
totaling $990,000 were made to 75
graduating seniors trom 48 small
colleges and universities around
the country to support study
abroad. About 24 students trom
Grinnell applied.

Kelly will study women's in
volvement in arms control and
disarmament in Sweden. West
Germany, England, and New
Zealand. She hopes to work with
both the grassroots and the official
side of arms control and to help im-
prove communication between the
two groups. Though expecting to
work primarily in western Europe,
Kelly plans on traveling to-eastern
Europe as well in order to study
their underground peace move
ment.

Kelly hopes her experience will
help increase involvement among

like to work." The marcher added
that he would be “proud to be a
taxpaylng citizen." However; the:
wages may be, so low that cit-aid
recipients wonder it they should
get back on aid to receive the
benefits, Mothers need the medical
benefits included with federal aid
ior their children.

Child care tor those people who
are receiving weliare or minimum
wages is another major issue. UNl
wants child care to he provided on
the state level, based on the
population and need ot each area.
All at the Committee members
agreed that there is a real demand
for child Care, that “it's an expenr
sive reality.” Currently, the only
Subsidized daycare center in the
state is in Davenport, with a
waiting list of over 100 children.

This lack of adequate child care
impedes the escape oi many recie
pients tram tederal aid programs.
According to UNI, many people
who try to work or to get an educa-
tion slip back onto lederal aid pro
grams because “you never know
when the baby sitter is gone,”

Initially, the committee wanted
a lo-percent increase in Aid tor
Dependent Children (AFDC) but
the bill asks for a 3.4»percent ins
crease. According to UNI, the need
{or this increase is quite evident, in
1979. a family 01 four received 8395
per month; in 1934, after a
5.7vpei-cent increase, this amount
was increased to 3419. Despite this

her peers “l’m discouraged with
my generation," She said. “We
have a legacy ot the SOS which we
can’t live up to. i wonder where the
momentum has gone, and id like
to bring some new ideas back with
me to inspire my generation, 1
don't feel like they're apathetic
people; they’re just not inspired."

Manatt will study the COHCIEI’"
cia. a women's grassroots political
group in Argentina. He will work
with mothers whose children or
iamily members have disappeared
because at government actions As
Argentina makes the transition to
democracy, Manatt hopes to work
on grassroots and Civilrrlghts
issues,

The Thomas J. Watson
Fellowship program is a national
competition which supports in-
dependent ioreign research and
travel tor recent college
graduates. Single Fellows receive
stipends of $131,000, while Fellows
accompanied by a dependent
receive $18,000. The grants support
a year or iocused study and ex-
perience in a field of which the
Fellow has demonstrated the
potential lor leadership.

The Watson Fellowship Program
is administered through 54 ouutan-
ding small private colleges and
universities which nominate
seniors [or the award. The
tellowships have been awarded an
nually since 1969 by the Thomas J,
Watson Foundation, a charitable
trust established by the late Mrs.
Thomas_i,.,Watson,,Sr.,, in memory
at her husband, the founder of In-
ternational Business Machines
Corporation. Since the inception oi
the program. 1,375 fellowship
awards have been made, with
stipends totaling $12,033,634.

small increase, the average in
come of families’on AFDC in 1984
was 44 percent below the poverty
level. Four years later, in 1983, the
cost at living is much higher and
lormer levels or and are just “not
enough to meet needs.H Further
more, according to uNl, every
time the government raises AFDC
levels, tood stamp levels are
lowered.

Coordination of human services
is a third important issue in UNI,
Not all people are aware of sources
oi federal aid that are available for
them. UNI cites a need [or so,
meone to help recipient families
”make the transition from
dependency to sell-sulficiency."
There is a need for more than job
placement; otten recipients need
help building their selleesteem in
order to get off aid.

UNI strongly denied the popular
myth that iederal aid programs
teed the cycle ot poverty. Reci-
pients don't have more childen in
order to receive more aid. Accor-
ding to the marchers. no one
receiving federal aid is proud of it.
or wants their Children to receive it
as adults.

Like many other social-retorm
groups, UNI has had a hard time
gaining support, and the response
is varied, The group's main goal is
to Show other recipients that they
are not alone.
