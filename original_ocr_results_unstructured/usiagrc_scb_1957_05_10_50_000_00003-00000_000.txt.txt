Faculty Visits Schools Across Nation
To Evaluate Independent Study Plans

Independent study and honors work as carried on at
nearly a dozen other outstanding colleges across the country
received a thorough checking by various faculty members
during recent trips undertaken in connection with Grin-
nell's own experimental “4-3" plan.

“On the whole," Dean of

said this week, “the reports our people have been making

on such work at other colleges
indicate that our programs are
as effective as any _ in several
cases, more effective."

The faculty “scouts" found
programs in the other colleges
ranging from almost no inde~
pendent work or honors projects
to some carried out on arac—
tically an all—college scale. (The
survey included half a dozen
of the ”best” colleges or uni-
versities named in the Chicago
Tribune’s recently published
list.

Pennsylvania Colleges

Probably the most thorough
going program was found at

Swarthrnorc, which, with Have
erford and Bryn Mawr. was
visited by Helena Percas

(Spanish) and Paul G, Kuntz,
(Philosophy and Religion). All
three of these Pennsylvania col-
leges are able to pool library
resources with those of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania,

About one—third of all Swarth-
more juniors and seniors are
enrolled in the honors program,
for which, qualified second-
semester sophomores may apply.
The honors work is done chief<
ly through seminars ,and there
are, no examinations for two
years. At the end of the senior
year. .the student takes eight
written and oral examinations
given by examiners from other
institutions.

At Havertord, “honorahle

course to any freshman or
sophomore who does satisfac-

honors candidates may take
up to five independent pro-
jects, which may mean attend-
ing no classes at all during
the senior year. In addition to
the honors program, ”special
projects" or “special topics"
courses are offered by almost
every department.

Bryn Mawr's curriculum in-
volves much independent work
with all four classes, made pos-
sible in large part by small
teaching loads of 7 to 9 hours,
Honors work is offered only
to students who have shown unr

carry on considerable indepenr
dent work.

California Schools

Five California institutions 7
Pomona, Serious, Occidental,
Stanford, and Redlands 7 were
visited by Neal W. Klausner

found considerable variance in

the honors and independent

Under the present revision,
students may indicate their
preferences for instructor and
group when they fill out their
registration cards. Then, during
the summer, the registrar will
pull the class cards according to
class standing: seniors, juniors
and sophomores in that order.
After a section is closed, the re.
maining sections will be com-
pleted at random from the re-
maining registration cards.

Dean of the College R. Ho.
mer Norton stated that lie was
“quite happy with the way
the matter turned out and
pleased that we preserved the
benefit of avoiding long lines
and still preserved all the
other advantages,"

Norton also said that the or-
iginal change in registration was
suggested in the interests of the
student and faculty and was not
intended to take away any
values of a Grinnell education.
