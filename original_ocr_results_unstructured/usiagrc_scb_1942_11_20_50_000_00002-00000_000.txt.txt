He Made Us Think~--

There is probably nothing higherto be said
in praise 01' Stewart Hennan than that com—
ment currently heard all over this campus:

“He made me think." That is exactly what
we, as college students typifying a whole
generation, not to metion a whole section of
‘the country, have needed. ’Mr. Herman did
not come here with ideas—or at least he
kept his pet theories, if any, pretty well
hidden. He came here with facts, and it
was up to us to do what we would in rear
ranging our own values to fit them. Inci-
dently, his were the first facts we’ve listen-
ed to in a long time, even though we’ve
heard others.

A lot of us had to find values before we
could do any rearranging. Mr. Herman is
no magic pedagogue. He did not suddenly
empower us with knowledge or with pas-
sionate, if feathery, idealism. He told _us
a story which happened to be true. And its
authority, its simplicity, and its dogged fair-
ness hit us as all the tootling of fife and
drum have not. It is small compliment to
our intelligence that some of us had to be
told that the severe bombings which have
supposedly so strengthened the British
morale could hardly be expected to make
the Germans psychological wrecks within a
week. But at any rate, we've been told '
and a few other obvious and hitherto igno
ed facts. Knowing them, or being made
aware of them again, we may do some ser—
ious settling down about this war. Oh, this
afterglow isn’t going to last forever. But we

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

take the stir, the ripple of serious conyersae
tion and even controversy among the stu-
dent body during the last two days as a
good sign. There was food for much
thought in what Stewart Herman said. But
that actual ihouglt should be initiated by
the students—not , ist a lohashing of ideas,
for Herman wasn’t passing out carbon cop-
is —is the best compliment we could pay
him.

So he has come and _Q‘One. We wish him
well on his mission to England. We expect
to hear of him again; we expect to refer in
greater length to the results of his visits i
as they continue to develop. And mean—
time we remember with pleasure a theologu
ian who refused to be theological; a'man u ho
pushed us illto defining our own ideals by
refusing to burden lls with his own, pre—
digested; a man who used “democracy” not
once in four lectures; a man who could af-
ford to hope because his feet, ersatz socks
or no, were firmly on the ground.

To Be Brief: Hooray!——-

We are gathered here today, ohibrethren,
to celebrate the resurrection of another
Grinnell tradition. No longer must we slink
to the Checker for a quick coke between
classes. No longer must we meet in the
‘rec’ room for a sociable game of bridge.
No longer w'l we be forced to buy our own
cigarettes if we want a quick drag. The
WHITE HOUSE will be with us once more.

After passing the mid-semester mark,
most of the students at Grinnell had given
up the idea of a White House. We did need
a recreational spot...a spot where we could
gather to dance, eat, talk, and generally
relax. But the war, and a few other things
of more importance than a recreational cen-
ter, got in the way.

Now the Faculty Club has been emptied
of its temporary residents. Painters have
already begun' work. It is only a matter
of a week or so before we can move in.

There is one point that must be remem—
bered, however. The White House must
not be abused. Last year students lived at
the White House. They dashed from the
dorms and the quad to have breakfast. They
cut classes in order to continue a bridge
game, dance, or just “bull." They hung
around after classes were out, and barely
managed to get home in time for dinner.
And then back again they went. ‘Perhaps
a half hour at the libe, and then over once
more. The White House wasapopularplace.
This year, more than ever; it should be 1301)
ular, but not quite in the same manner.
The White House is for recreation. And
recreation fits it ONLY when you have
leisure time, Don't abuse the privilige.
