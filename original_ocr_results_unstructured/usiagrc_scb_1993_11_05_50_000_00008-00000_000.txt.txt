hell College has had a relationship
with Domestic Abuse Altematives/
Sexual Abuse Coilition out of
Marshalltown," said Eilert. “Last
Fall (’93), the college set up its own
24-hour crisis line. It‘s a separate
hotline where a group of trained ad-
vocates are ready to talk with you.
It's totally coniidental. There is also
a group on campus called Change
and Justice that works wtth legal is-
sues andpoliu'cal organizations. They
do a lot of educational presentations
on abuse. There are a group of stu-

dents who go to shelter houses about
twice a month to help with
maintanance, cleaning, etc."

Bakken and Eilerthope that stu»
dents will go to see the clothesline.

“It’s important that people are
awareof domestic abuse," saidEilert.
“If there is going to be more support
for survivors and a decrease in vio-
lence agninstwomen, the world must
become aware.”

described what he saw and felt dur-
ing a recent trip to Armenia, “I was
struck by a word that sort of hit me
and touched me again. It was almost
a theme running in my mind It was
the word desinigration, because] saw

He argued that the world has
been using a “humanitarian alibi“ in
shrugging it‘s shoulders toward these
problems, especially the genocide
occurring in BosniaJ-lerzegovina.
“Governments of the world will pass
the buck and not take responsibility
and say we’ll send some military

doesn’t solve the problem and it‘s
done more to make Americans feel
