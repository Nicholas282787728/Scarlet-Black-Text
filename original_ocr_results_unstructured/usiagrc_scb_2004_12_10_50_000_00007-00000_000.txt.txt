The Passion of
the Christ (R)

The dcvil is really a pale androgynous creature in a
cape who has a worm crawling from one nostril to the
other. This is one of the wonderful lessons our old pal
Mel Gibson teaches us in TIM Puriimi gftbe C/ll‘iil. Af-
ter all the controversy surrounding this movie, perhaps
it would be worthwhile for us all to get our little butts
to Harris and see what we’ve been arguing about, last
We look like the conservative Christialis who protested
Dagrlm on hearsay alone,

The film is intense: intensely beautiful at points,
intensely violent most of the way through, intensely

frightening when Judas starts to go crazy and sees dc:

mons in the faces of small children around the temple.
Although I don't really imagine that l nccdcd to see Jc-
sus'back turned to hamburger,l did appreciate the way
the film ceremoniously traveled through the stations
of the CrossThe ﬁlm is well done, well conceived and
artfully shot, It’s not a quickly thrown-together piece
ofChristian propaganda by any means, nor is it one or
those dopey network miniseries.

I was going to write a paragraph about the argu-
ment about antirSemitism, but I don't think I can
satisfy anyone, since I've had the fight over and over,
Let's just say that you’re not completely right and I’m
not completely right, and most of the media argu—
ments have been pretty damn myopic about it, both
ways. Talking about religious media in secular media is
bound to get a little screwed up.

That said, I wonder how Mel Gibson is able to jus—
t-‘ify the millions ofdollars he made from this film. lfit
was an exercise in faith, why the epic marketing scale?

If you really have a beef with this film and you
haven't seen it, you should see it. But ifyou’d Like to see
a less painful version of the life ofjcsus. like that old
hippie standby Gadlpell orJerar Clm'if 51113273111? with
the cutestjudas ever, this is not the way to go.

Harold & Kumar Go
to White Castle (R)

Good movies need a mission, 3 goal for lovable
characters to overcome in a neat 90 minutes, like be
coming an Olympic bobsled team, landing on Mars or
graduating from a selective liberal arts college. Otjust
going to a fast food restaurant.

In what amounts to a overlong advertisement for
sliders (those absurdly small burgers) Ham/d {i Ku—
mm G47 to Win}: Cari/e is about two minority guys who
overcome great discrimination and great distance to
sate their urge for munchies.Their trip isn’t as simple as
a trip through the drive»through, as a bunch ofabsurd
obstacles, including racists, a raccoon and Neil Patrick
Harris, stand in their way.

The geniusrtype responsible for this masterpiece is
Danny Leiner, who last directed the equally wellstitled
Dude, W/Jm’i My Car? Harold C? Kumar shares all the
good qualities of its predecessor, John Clio, best know
as the milf guy from American Pie, and Kai Penn, the

Movies to distract Grinnellians from the pain of ﬁnals week

Indian Jake Gyllcnhaal, are good, underexposed comics
who do a great job reading their scripts, like Sean Wile
ham Scott and Ashton Kutchci before thctn. Almost
all ofthc humor is stupid, but that doesn't mean it isn’t
funny. While it may be terribly SCXISI, calling soniconc
“Vagina McVagiiiastecn" is hilarious.

Harp/(l fs’Ktimm- is the kind of movie that you'll
laugh all the way through, and than comc out ofl-Iarris
and realize that it isn't all that good and worthwhile.
To which I say poppycock! Besides the fact that this
movie perfectly follows Joseph Campbell’s model ofa
hero’s journey, stonerjokes, well, gnarl stonerjoltcs, are a
Welcome diversion from the fires of hell week.

JerseyG ((PG 3)

Kevin Smith is a Very original filmmaker, While
a comedy set entirely in a mall, or a wishrfult‘tllmcnt
romance in which a guy turns a hot lesbian straight
don’t sound path-breaking, in the past decade Smith
has crafted sparkling dialogue, outlandish yet personal
stories and two great recurring film characters, Jay and
Silent Bob.

In juicy Girl, though, he leaves most of this behind.
Gonc arc Jay and his silent hetero-lifemate, as well as
the voice that our generation relates to. In its place is
the tale of Ollie Trinke (Ben Afileck), a music publicist
whose big city life is uprooted after his wife (Jennifer
Lopez) dies while giving birth, seven years latci, he's
moved back to the Garden start, raising his daughter
with the help of his dad (George Carlin) and the local
video clerk, who rents him porn (Livaler). Now iirrri
a family the religious right will surely support.

Smith tried to make an adult movie about the bless-
ings of fatherhood, which he has recently and not as
traumatically experienced, but his effort is too strained.
This film has a cliche’ message about finding salvation
through parenting, a cliché soundtrack and a cliché cli-
max—Ben Affleck saves the day! While most of the
acting is belietmbleen Afileck is charmingithis
movie feels like it was made by somebody dse and only
has a few moments ofgenuinc Kevin Smith greatness,
which almost feel out of place.

The juggernaut of the “Bennifer” clobbered Jer-
rsy Girl at the box ofﬁce and lost in the wreckage is a
ﬂawed but notrawful movie. Kevin Smith tried some-
thing different: a strategy which always worked for him
in the past, but here produced the sort of heartwarmr
ing yet hollow movic you’d expect from the Hollywood
studio system. —r£vie'w£d by Bradley Iverteanang

The Bourne
Supremacy (PG- 13)

All you need to know is that Matt Damon is Ja—
son Bourne and that Jason Bourne can do just about
anythingmcept remember his past. You don't cvcn
need to have seen TIM Boonie Idmrxly, the original to
this sequel. Basically, the CIA is afterjason Bouine, but
Bourne kills anyone the government scnds after him,
This movie centers around a plot framing Bourne
for an explosion in Europe, while simultaneously go

“We challenge any one to go back and forth

develop more mold in the sink, or eat more tacos
than my ﬂoor," said Megan Ford ’06, S.A, of the
Cleveland pit clan putting on an art show this
Saturday, 7~9 p.m.

One of the proud members of the ﬂoor said, ”We
have eaten around 200 tacos, mostly of the came
asada variety” .

This year’s Cleveland pit is perhaps of one tank
eating mind because it is a_theme ﬂourt However,
the theme is not ”taco—eating", but rather.

”art.” The art show on Saturday night will boast
"paintings, drawings, sculpture, and music," said
Amos Goldbaum ‘07, one of exhibit's illustrious
curators,

ing attcr Bourne, bringing him back into an unwanted
globcrtrotring spy life. But just who gains from sending
Bourne and the CIA after one another once again?

I’d say the audience. TeraurneSupmzmcy isn’t great
because of the confusing spy hierarchy, in which the
CIA can do anything and put a “top secret"stamp on in
It's great because ofthe ofvconfusing camera work of
director Paul Greengrass. Extending the logic of music
video hyper-editing to a welcome extreme, Greengrass
cuts out every millisecond that is not necessary to tell
the story, There are plenty of shaky cameras and close
ups to either confound or thrill the audience.

Sca c9 (

“Say hello to my leetle frenl" Ever heard that Line?
It’s from Scarface, 3 I983 film featuring Al Pacino as a
Cuban refugeerturned gangsterlt has avcry good story,
with action,love, and betrayal. In addition to Al Pacino,
Michelle Pfeiffer (Catwoman from Emmott Remmr)
and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonia (woman who gets
frozen and slapped around in Tbeﬂbytl) play largc roles
in the film.There are some other people you'll recogr
nize but have no idea what else they are from.

Although I endorse this movie, you may not, so l
need to tell you beforehand what you're getting into.
This is a story of Florida‘s organized crime in the early
1980s, and you will receive, according to wwwimdb.
com, over 40 deaths and over 180 occurrences of the
Frword on a verylarge screen. Violcncc, drugs,and ma-
terialism are gloriﬁed at times, but this movie strives
for realism.

Realism yes, but Scarface is 21 years old, so there
are a few things that may detract from your viewing ex-
perience. Some of the clothing or dramatic synthesized
music may make you giggle a little, as well as the 80s
club scene. You'll adjust to the settings quickly enough,
though. Video gamers who know Grand Theft Auto:
Vice City will notice some uncanny similarities to the
film Scarface Many video game lovers will beneﬁt
from watching this film, where the game is a gateway
drug into reality.

The unfortunate thing about scheduling this movie
for finals week is that it’s a bit lengthy at 170 minutes.
Whether you're a fan of Pacino or not, you should still
see this movie sometime in your life. Despite its length,
this movie is by no means boring and the time ﬂies by.

Hall ’07:

"There will be a lot of gestural work," said
Goldbaum. "Peter (laugh and I will be doing a lot
of photocopies They are a main theme of ours.”

Advertising for the show has been intense,
according to the gentlement of the flour,
”Nobody’s seen‘signs as big as ours since Rodney
Dangerfield,” said Hall.

In additions to gargantuan signs, the curators
spent an evening spreading the word about
their show and collecting for supplies ”We are
collecting to pay for party favors," sal'd Goldhaumt
"Arid cheeset And crackers, And cheese grab bags."

As for the show itself, Goldhaum said, "Don't
come if you don't like art very much "But on the
other hand, when Hall said "I’m not much ofan
artist," Goldbaunl replied: "If there's one thing you
should’ve learned this year, it’s that everybody is
an artist," —Emilin Garvey
