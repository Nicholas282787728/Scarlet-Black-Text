Week’s Rest After Hard Games
Needed By McAlmon’s Squad

November 20.

in All .iiiouipt io remedy the some-
what unusually lieaiy tootball licdiile

the Monmouth game, which would have
been ployed on waid Field next Sat<
iirday, has been cancelled. it is pos<
sible thc contract may he continued

Collie here Ill 1916,

With six games passed with so cred.
liable a record, the squad has repert<
ed this week iii a battered condition
and the week’s rest beloi-c the [mat
mix with Cornell, November 20, will
be extremely valuable, This would
have been impossthC with the Men-
mouth game still on the list.

Oliicial action was taken by the
Board or Control Monday night upon
the recommendation or Coach McAl-
nion, and the general support or such
a proposition by nearly every one in
authority, dicAlinon pointed out that
eight straight games such as Gl'lnnell
has played was too long a time to keep
a team in condition.

There was no practice Monday, and
only a light practice Tuesday, that the
team might have ample time to recup-
erate mm the Drake battle. It is
hoped that every member of the squad
will be back in condition in time for
the Cornell game next week. While a
Grinnell victory is anticipated in view
ot comparative scores and general
showing of the two teams, Coach Fin<
ger's team has not yet been deieated
this season. They have been playing
at brand oi football that will require
the best of Giiunell ,

The soccer game with town is an-
other event scheduled for Saturday
which has been changed, the probable
date being Norenlber 20. This clash
“as to have been one of the features
at the day of the InwarAllies gridiron
battle, but had to be postponed.
