TIME TO DECIDE

Organizations of any kind are lust as much 01'
just as little as their Illelubers lntlkc tllcni. Class
organizations in Grinncll scam to have reached the
lowest level of thci usefulness, and to have bct‘olllt)
artificial units. It i still convenient to sort students
as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors, but
any usefulness as organizations which those names
may have and did, at one time, represent, is lost
disappearing.

Officers are elected, usually by a small part of
the class, and then dre'prolnptly left to ,do or neg-
lcct as they please, the affairs of an apathetic so-
ciety. Class members act as if thcy were doing the
officers :1 personal favor to come to traditional
functions, when they come. If one of the purposes
of having classes organized is to promote social
good times and friendship within the class, and the
attitude is one of apathy or cvell dislike, as it is
today with many Grinnelliuns, then the class plaiue
ly is becoming outmoded.

It is up to thc students to decide whether they
mean what their behavior signifies about their
class organizations. If classes arc useless hangovers
whose place is taken by other interests, let them be
done away with. If not, let tllem he supported.

intentionally, there is no excuse for them. .

THE WORLD LAUGHS
(From the Daily Northwestern)

Student “gripes” against the administration and
against the system arc numerous, and are often ration-
alization for incapability or laziness. On the other hand.
they have more foundation in fact. than they are usually
given credit for having. Many educators realize this.
but seem to be unable to do anything about. it.

Then how about the faculty? Here again we are
led to suspect rationalization for lncapability or laziness.
Faculty meetings must be interesting, from occasional
leaks through to students, Faculty members and uni-
verslty executives complain of students even as students
complain of them.

Who is right? or is anyone right? Let us examine
further:

a 3’

The host of the average high school orop comes to
the university‘witl‘i the‘firm conviction that college is an
ideal place where one finds a release from .the cramped
inanities of high school, and where one can develop and
grow into a thinking, intelligent being. with a oultural.
mental, emotional and moral maturity. The best. of the
crop believes this. Students Come to school intending to
have as good a time as possible While about the business,
hut the number who begin with the country club com-
plex is much, much less than is commonly believed.

Orioe in college, we plunge our prep-school gradu-
ate, full of ideals and hopes and potentialities. into a
hurried, thoughtrimpossible existence which is not a uni-
versity, but is a wealthy corporation run on principles
of moss education, offering an advanced high school
curriculum.

We thwart or eramp any attempt at self~expression
or creativeness by grades, memory examinations, hosts
of required courses for which the student may be unfit
or disinterested. We demsnd attendance at classes.
When we realize perfectly well that many lectures are
utter wastes of time; oftEn these lectures are given by
bored, or boring, instructors, or by professors who feel
it beneath their station to teach novices, but who need
money. We emphasize hours of Credit rather than
knowledge, and indiscriminately mix dull and brilliant
students, engineers, prevdentists and commerce men all
in the same Liberal Arts English course.

The catalog is so long one could never attempt to
do it justice. And as has all been said before at that.
Yet Dr. Butler wonders why the American college youth
doesn’t Share national responsibilities as does the unir
versity student in Russia, Spain. England, France,
China and Germany!

u

se.

What about the other side to the story?

Day after day disheartened educators see ideals
giving way before the onslaught of money-making
demands. They see such courses as ”hotel management.”
heing added to the curriculum . . . and why? Not be-
cause college administrators think hotels need better
managers, but because the students demand such things.
They demand them because we have made college avail~
able to all classes of people, and only the wealthy can
afford to enjoy a, strictly cultural education. With so
much competition, American universities have to offer
what their students want.

Today there are more literate people than at any
other time in history, This is an excellent thing, But
no one will deny, 1 think, that they have acquired liter»
hey at the cost of a college education that is worthy of
the name,

And so our educator no time—hallowed, high stan-
dards of univei ly tradition crumbling about their curs.

President A. G. Crane of the Uni-
