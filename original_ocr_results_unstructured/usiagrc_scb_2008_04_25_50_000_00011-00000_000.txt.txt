“Kink that the raw

War requiem

This weekend, the» Griunell Singers. Court
rnunity Chorus, and Grinnell Symphony Or-
chestra, along with soloists and a numhet of
other nrrrs us, will be performing Benja-
min Btrttcn's Wat Requiem, one of the most
powerful works ofthe 20th cerrtrrry'l‘he piece
combines the Latin text ofthe Requiem Mass
(for the dead) with English texts by Vl/ilfrcd
Owen, a fascinating poet who fought in World
War] and became a pat-inst. Britten composed
the piece to commemontte VVurltl War II, and
it was first performed at Britain's Coventry
Cathodral,which was bombed d ring the war.

Unfortunately, we. the miisi ans, in pure
ting together this magnificent and outraa
geously drffreult piece. have not had a chance
to examine the texts, the meaning or lirittcn’s
true message. We have taken it for granted.
Our conductor has tried to help us understand
the mood of the piece, urging us to imagine
“the Nazis marching in” to evoke fear, but in
my opinion, he is not conveying the War Re-
quiem's true message, The piece rs not about
the evil Nazis marching in and destroying ev-
erything. It’s about human beings killing other
human beings, and how deranged and sick that
is. It's about political leaders sacrificing human
life for their own personal gain. as the rest of
us sit complacently, watching people die, and
as elergymen preach the virtues of war, never
having experienced the hortots ofwar them-
selves It's not about how evil the Nazis were
but how SIMILAR they were to us. Because
Nazis in themselves are no longer very scary.
But the fact that Nazis were humans. just like
us, is bone chilling.

The texts, as stated above, were written by
Wilfred Owen about World War I, so there
certainly wasn’t any “blame the evil Germans”
mentality behind them, Owen wrote about the
meaninglessncss of the war, the trivialization
of human life, the hypocrisy of those who or
der or support war without ever ﬁghting, and
the similarity between soldiers ofall “3“ch
aﬁtlcsriflghrlng for contrived notions of na—
tionalism and serving not their own interests
but some leader’s.

Likewise, Benjamin Britten saw war as
completcly immoral, He was a conscieoe
tious objector in World War II and moved to
America to avoid taking the heat for it. Even
when one of his closest paciﬁst friends joined
the war, because “if there ever was a case when
force has got to be used, this is it,“ Britten tee
jectcd the claim and became very angry

I had trouble With this idea at ﬁrst, because
I obviously take the Holocaust very seriously
and believe that intervention was necessary.
But that eetta ly does not mean that the Alt

ANGRY?

lies were complctcly moral in their actior
World \Vir II, noi did they, as I once tonnntr
cally rmagineil enter the war explicitly to end
the genocide (the Holocaust, it seems, was
rather an afterthought) Britten saw blame on
both SidCS and good men on both sides. This
is espcc' rily apparent tn the last movement, rn
which the German burnout: and British tenor
meet in lieavcn/hcll/itfrerlifc and become, in
a way, friends, bonding over the unjustifiable
cruclties ot’war, and ending the entire piece
with the words “let us sleep now".

I think it is a shame we haven’t had time to
really think about the War Requiem, its texts,
and its meaning, bccausc I think these texts,
when understood properly. resonate with a lot
of us. I hope this deepens the meaning or the
piece instead oftcduertrg rt to good vs evil, and
I hope we can, in understanding it more urti-
mately, create a heart-wrenching performance,

To Grinnell’s
trustees:

As you meet on campus this weekend we
urge you to uphold Grinnells values by sup-
porting five environmentally related share
holder resolutions at ConocoPhillips,' in which
we hold investments. Votes on these resolut
tionsr whose text is available from the Web
address below, will be due to ConocoPhillips
on May 7, 2008, and we expect the Trustees to
take action—or to explain publicly why they
have not.

In order to continue the college’s progress
toward endowment responsibility, we also urge
the Trustee Investment Committee to estabr
Lish a Committee on Responsible investment
at Grinnell. We hope the Investment Come
mittee will reconsider its rejection earlier this
year of a proposal for such a Committee

In the past five days alone, we have colt
lectcd nearly 200 signatures on a petition call-
ing for this action, and we will continue to do
so, both on campus and via alumni networks,
student government senators unanimously
supported the text of the petition as a Joint
Board resolution last week, and several student
groups have expressed ofﬁcial support.

The petition is available online at http://
woavipetrtronsconr/petrtioo/Grrnncll,Conoe
coPhillips/.

We applaud past trustee efforts toward the
responsible investment of crinnell’s nearly $2
billion endowment, but more could be done

In February, the trustees approved a some
mendable addition to the college's investment
policy, stating that social responssility is
taken into account when making investment

CONFUSED?

decisions. such a commitment, however, needs
concrete action behind it

In 2007, the Treasurer’s Office began pub-
lishing a quarterly list ofGrinncll's stock hold-
ings. This is a good ﬁrst step, but the hat is
in tceessiblc to many members of the Grinncll
community and does not include any measure
ofthe quantity or these holdings ltr' addition,
according to Standard 8e Poor s, these stocks
account for only 40 percent ofonr endowment
(as ($2006), andl lltl c Information IS available
About the other 60 pclcen' bank accounts,
bonds, private cqui ,hedge funds and so on
No students sit on the Investment Commit-
tee, and the Grinrrell community has limited
contact with its members, We apptccrate that
trustees recognize their molal responsibility
toward the college, but assurance from the
Trustee Investment Committee that they “are
Grinnellians too" does not substitute for m,
downrent transparency,

The college currently delegates all respon-
sibility for shareholder engagement to private
investment managers, and Treasurer Clay has
stated that the college does not even keep tee
cords of the shareholder votes of these mane
agers. We are heartened that he has expressed
support for finding this inrot nationiand we
encourage the college to publi zc investment
managers shareholder voting policies and to
cordsibut this rs not enough,

The Board ofTrustces is solely responsible
for safeguarding Grinnell’s mission. as well
as its financial stability, and this responsibil-
ity cannot be delegated. As carefully selected
as our investment managers may be, Grinneil
is only one among their nrany clients, and it
is the college's r-esponsibrhty to ensure that its
Values are reﬂected in managers’ actions.

Investment Committee Trustees have been
quick to point out supposed logistical obt
stacles to shareholder action or other respon-
siblc investment techniques, yet many other
institutions—including every Ivy League
universiryiparucipdte in shareholder voting,
and many colleges have developed rnnomtive
methods for using their endowments proac-
tively for social good

opportunities abound for Grinnell to do
the same. For example, our group identified
over 50 socially or environmentally focused
shareholder resolutions that the college could
vote on this year. at nearly 30 different oomprre
triesAs another strategy, peer rnstitutiorrs such
as Macalester have transferred liquid assets
from standard bank accounts to community
banks offering microctedit.

\Ne feel that the real obstacle to moving
forward on responsible investnrcnt is a reluc-
tance on the part of the Investment commie
ice to implement new strategies.

Being open and hold about responsible int

vcstment improves the college's image among
potential donors, prospective students and
the general public, arid pitst Trustee action
has not gone unnoticed, From 2007 to 2008,
for instance, Grinnell got better marks on its
sustainability Report Card in two categories
"Endowment Transparency" rose from F" to
“13" and “Investment Priorities” from “C” to
A creating a Committee on Responsible
investment would also offer students unique
experiential learning opportunities,such as our
group has had in working on this issue.

In the next two weeks, we expect you to act
on the aforementioned ConocoPhillips reso-
lutions, and we look forward to hearing from
you soon.

Kosher good

students aren't wrong to make demands
of Dining Services, we pay an awful lot, and
we deserve options for vegans, vegetarians and
foodeallergy folks But this week. Jewish stu-
dents had some particularly stringent requests,
and Dining Services did an excellent job in
trying to accommodate us.

For those who didn't notice the many pink
labels in the dining hall. this week was Pass-
over, during which observant Jews abstain
from a lot of foodsﬂnd I mean. a lot We
don’t eat any leavened food, com, beans, rice,
peas or most grains. A lot.

As you might imagrne, this can make eat-
ing a bit complicated, particularly when the
dining hall relics a lot on soy oil to cook most
of its food.

But this year in particular, Dining services
stepped up to the challenge and worked int
credibly hard to make this week easier for all
ofus breadechallenged. A meeting with dining
hall staff explained many ofthe special rules,
and as a result many dining hall employees
could answer questions about what was kosher
and what wasn‘t,

Furthermore, the foods themselves were es-
pecially good, considering that no ﬂour could
be used. Fries cooked in olive oil and special
pasta in the “Sautc’c” station meant that we
weren’t stuck with buttered matzah for every
meal. Matzah pizzas and matzah hambugers
even let us eat like college students.

But best of all were the cheese blintzes.
Sweet and wonderfulicvcn my grandmother
would approve.

In fact, if there’s one complaint I would
make, us that there wasn’t enough food, Be
cause you don't have to be Jewish to love
cheese blintzcs.
