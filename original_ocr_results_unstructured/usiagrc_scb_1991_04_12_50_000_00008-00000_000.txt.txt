Experimental Avocados evokes
laughter, wonder, and dread

By Ryan Mc Naughlon

Following the tradition of ex7
perimenial theater started so many
years ago at Grinnell by the great
HallieFlanagan,AvacadasAreNol
Sold Here (AANSH'), the latest ei-
fort by student director, Rob Neill,
takes great strides away from the
lmt‘liLitmal and the expected.

On paper, AANSH is a hodge-
podge oi scraps from the likes of
Harold Pinter's The Hothouse.
Shakespeare‘s Richard II, and the
poetry 0i Ted Hughes and T. S.
Eliot, into which Neill himself has
injected a small amount ofol'iginal
work. Performed, it becomes a
wonderful, visually striking mon-
tage of movement, action and
emotion,

The cast of Elisabeth Borg-
Bowman. Todd Erler, Kenton
Guilbert, Jeiemy Hawkinson, Sam
Lobel, Brandari McClain,Jen Sultz
and Laura Waxman are almost all
clad in simple, unrelieved black to
which they add or subtract as the
scenes dictate.

The set and lighting, the labor of
loci Shepherd, is amazingly pow-
erful while reﬂecting the same
stylized simplicity of the costumes.
The visual images ﬂow between set
scenes much like a well oiled, ma-
chine that issomehowalivc. Things
ebb and ﬂow between the amusmg,
the frightening, the manic, and the
Sublime.

Anselmo Di Iorio is from Clll-

being what it is, sons of important
PLUMBERS have the opportunity
to go see really important bands,
likeNAKED RAYGUN. You may
have even heard of ‘em. Sam's
friend DEAN sure has; Dean went

could tell.

Mike Nield is the son of sctcnr

Chicago too. And you guessed it:

“friend" was not overcome by a
pair of Doctor Martens but by the
exciting combination of sweat,
bodies, and AQUA-NET in the
audience. Again, the facts are
sketchy, but we think an AMBU-
LANCE was involved.

But it's not like the Chicago
scene is noLhing but Violence and
