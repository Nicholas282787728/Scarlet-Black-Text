Michigan To Settle
Association Question

"What about the Y. w. c. A.’!” That
is the question to be solved at a meet»
ing of. all University women to be
held at 4 o’clock this aiternoon in
Newherry hall.

The problem or whether Michigan
women can best express themselves
as a department or the s. c. A., or in
an organization which is a chapter of
the national Y. W. c. A. is to be de-
cided definitely at this meeting.

Every woman enrolled in the Uni—
versity is requested to come to the
meeting and express her ideas on the‘
subject.

A baseball ticker has been installed
in the Michigan Union Building by
the Western Union telegraph com-
pany. The ticker works on the same
principal as does the stock exchange
ticker ,and gives the batteries or ev-
cry major league baseball game, and
the score of all eight games at the
end or every inning .Score boards
are to be put up in the building show-
ing the complete scores oi the major
leagues.

The linal issue of Fl'ivol, the Uni.
versity ol lowa humorous magazine.
was placed on sale in all colleges on
the campus Wednesday. The issue,
according to the editors, was sched-
uled to take away those “examination
blues” and apparently succeeded in
its avowed purpose, ii advance rir
moi-s are to be relied rrpon.

l At The Theaters

“rum; PM"

Dorothy Gish is a high liyer in more
ways than one in her new Paramount
picture, “Flying Put,” coming to the
Strand theatre next Sunday. The
peppery comedieune has the role or
an amateur ariatr in a rollicking
story oi young mar ed tile.

h 55 Gish is Jane Van Nuys, who
married captain Bob Von Nuys, an
aviator overseas. When they return
irom their honeymoon and Bob is
settled down as an airplane manufac—
turer, he insists that his who pick a
career for herself too. sue decides
to be a champion lady llyer. nob is
too busy to teach her the game, but a
Captain Elldiqott, his superintendent
is right on the job—several ways.
There is an airplane accident that
causes a domestic crash also, with
Jane lea rig llolue ima hull. Then
iollows some disillusionirrg advcn»
turcs out in the cold, cold world,
while l'I'lenrl husband searches irons
trcally ior her. The climax is (lee
clared to be mrr-thiul in the extreme,
and, or course, brings about a recon-
ciliatiorr.

Ho this [or old memories? The

Ed Andrews, is this our old Ed so
well and tavorahly known here twen-
ty years ago, or is it a new and
younger Ed with the same name? it
occurs to us that a tenuous comedian
or the same name once shook hands
with a railroad wrcclr and joined the
throng of singers on the other side.
We hope it wasn’t Ed at “Johnny
