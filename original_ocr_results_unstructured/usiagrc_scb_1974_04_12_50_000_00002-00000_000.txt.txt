Reviews labor Activities

by John Loni

H.L, Mitchell, a well known south~
ern radical and Socialist who has
been termed a “living legend” and
“a page out of history" gave two
Grinnell lectures Tuesday andWed-
nesday as a guest of the Progrrim
in Practical Political Education
(PPPE).

Mitchell, who co-founded the Silu—
thern Tenant Farmers’ Union
(STFU) and has remained active as
an agrarian labor organizer, spoke
on “Plantation Politics" Tuesday,
using a newsreel (“Land of Cot—
ton”) as part of his presentation
to a South Lounge audience of more
than fifty people.

The talk was primarily a series
of anecdotes dealing with Mitch»
ell’s associations with such fam-
ous and infamous people as Nor—
man Thomas, Eleanor Roosevelt,
Cesar Chavez, Ronald Reagan,

Values in Conﬂict.

Commoner, a noted ecologist, will
speak on “What Price Energy?”
at 8 pm. Wednesday.

Hubhert, a distinguished geophysi»
Cist, will speak at 9:30 a.m ThurSr
day on “Is the Energy Cri 5 Con»
trived or Real," Commoner will
ruin nubbert at 11:00 am. for an
informal convocation, “Is There A
Way Out?"

A panel of public officials. journr
alists, and oil executives will round
out the event.

Discussing “The Energy Crisis
in the Midwest." will be John Mil~
hone, editorial writer for the Des
Moines Register and Tribune, Har»
old W. Anderson, Director of Eur
vii‘onmental and Local Affairs for
the Iowa Farm Bureau, Dr. James
J. O‘Toole, Chairman of the Rue
Virontology Council at Iowa State
University, Dr. Samuel J. Tuthill,
Geologist for the State of Iowa.
Maurice Van Nostrand,‘ Chairman
of the Iowa CommerceCommission,
and William Wall, General Manager
for Public Affairs for Standard Oil
of Indiana.

and Richard Nixon.

He outlined the history of the
STFU as being one of the first
groups to concern itself with the
tenant farmer. Mitchell said that,
since the inception of slavery and
the ensuing share cropping system,
many people (especially Southern»
ers) have been abused both socially
and economically.

STFU, he emphasized, organized
both Blacks and Whites into one
group that was to abide by the
philosophy of non—violence.

Mitchell explained that the need to
organize the tenant farmer came,
in part. from the Great Depressw
ion, specifically from the drop of
cotton prices in the 1930’s. The
Depression showed the STFU that
the South needed to change .Irom a
single crop system, he said,

Declining cotton prices were cans
sed by strong foreign competition.
In order to stop declining prices,
plantation owners cut down on cot-
ton production, leaving many ten-
ant farmers unemployed. The Gr-
eat Depression also led the STFU
to advocate the use of written con-
tracts.

During the McCarthy ear, Mitch-
ell appeared beiore a Congressional
committee in an effort to get gov-
ernment aid for tenant flirmers.

Following the hearing, Mitchell
recalls. he was approachtd by a
young Congressman, Richard Nix»
on, who assured him that he had
nothing to fear if he were accused
or being a Communist »» that Nixon
would defend him,

But, when Nixon filed his report,
he said the request for aid should
he denied because no previous leg-
islation had included help for ten-
ant farmers, Mitchell said.

Reﬂecting on the past and pres-
ent, Mitchell gains satisfaction be-
cause the STFU was primarily res-
ponsihle for getting the federal go»
vernment involved in rura‘ reform.
Today, he wholeheartedly supports
the United Farm Workers Union
(urwl, considering it as an off-
shoot of the Southern Tenant Far-
mers’ Union.

structure and course offerings of
the departments, and recommend-
ing plans for substantive advising.
of students.

Recommendations from the Com»
mittee would be forwarded to the
Dean, the Faculty, or the Execu-
live Council, as appropriate.

Departments

Departmental EPC’S with at least
three student members, elected by
each department's majors in the
spring, would be iormalized under
the proposed legislation.

Such committees, although widely
used, have never been an orticialﬁ
part of the College structure. '

Each Departmental EPC would e-
lect a representative to the Student
Curriculum Council, which in turn
elects members of the Curriculum
Committee.

The Student Curriculum Council
could also meet from time to time
to help advise other bodies on aca—
demic policy and communicate aca-
demic concerns to and train stu-

dents.
Planning ‘

A second proposal would establish
a bong-Range Planning Committee,
composed of the Dean ofthe College,
the Chairman of the Faculty, the
Vice-President for Institutional De-
velopment, three elected faculty
members who serve three»year te-
rms, and two students appointed by
the President for one-year terms.

The Coin‘ruittee would be charged
with developing long-range recom-
mendations for any agency of th
College whicb requests such plans

Included in its duties would b
establishing long range goals per-
taining to the size, quality, and
character of the College; evaluating
trends in higher education and mak-
ing appropriate recommendations;
evaluating existing programs of the
College in terms of long range goals,
and evaluating both academic and
non-academic programs of the Col‘
lege in light oi long range insti»
tutional objectives.

Also under its scrutiny would be
budget recommendations to the Dean
of the College; providing a forum
for educational, development, and
financial planning; and issuing an
annual report to the Faculty on its
work. .

Streamline

Supporters of the two pieces 0
legislation say their adoption would
streamline the decision~making and
advisory processes at Grinnell.

Adoption of the Curriculum Comm-
ittee proposal would eliminate the
shared position situation that curr-
ently exists for members of the
Executive Council who also serve
on the All-Campus EPC, while tor-
malizing several structures which
have existed on an ad boc basis f0.
several years.

A Long»nange Planning Committee
would relieve the Executive Council
of a duty that, supporters of the
plan say, they have neither the time
nor the personnel to handle.

Faculty consideration of the plan
will begin at 4:15 Monday in Scienc.
171. That meeting is open to the
Campus Community.
