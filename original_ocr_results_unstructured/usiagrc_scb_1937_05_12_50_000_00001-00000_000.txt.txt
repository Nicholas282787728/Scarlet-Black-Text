Coach Pleased

Will Have Wide Choice

Next Fall

By SCOTTY McLEOl)

"I'm going to have a lot of fun
picking a starting lineup next
fall,” Guy Lookabaugh informed
this writer in discussing the re-
sults of the spring football drills
yesterday. ”I’ve got men at least‘
two deep in every position. They
are men I feel I can depend on.
That means I'm going to have a
lot of fun.”

Talking to Lookabaugh and
watching him work 'with his F107
neer gridders this spring leads
one to compare him to a scientist
working in a laboratory. “Lool-ue”
has grounded his double-wing
back system on a firm basis of
fundamentals. He has changed
the system slightly in order to fit
it more perfectly to the material
at hand and in order to better

' combat the general type of defense
the Pioneers will meet.

Ahead 01 Last Year
in pleased with spring prac-
tice," Lookabaugh said. “Of
course it wasn't. perfect, but we
are far ahead of last year both in
fundamentals and in ‘inside' foot-
bail."

Taking a list of squadmen out
of an inside pocket, Lookabaugh
proceeded to discuss the man-
power at each position. He's not
worrying about the center post.
Grimes and Shelton, two husky
freshmen, together with reserve
Ed Vaughn are being counted on
to divide the pivot duties.

Smith Preps
to Take Part
in Program

Freshmen Blame Incident
on Misunderstanding

of Purpose

Smith hall upperclassmen and
freshmen today had ironed out the
problem of the prep's participa»
tion in “Improvement Day" activ-
ities to be staged Saturday.

It had been reported earlier this
week that the first year‘ men had
organized to oppose the plans and
threatened refusal to cooperate
with upperclassmen in the im-
provement program.

“Problem Settled," osborn

Jack Osborn. president of
Smith, this morning said, "The
problem has been settled and the
program will g. on as planned."

The stand of the first year men
was expressed by one of their
number who said, 'Everything is all
right now. It was simply a mis-
understanding. We thought it
was going to be a ‘Hell-Week‘
proper, but, finding that it’s a
house initiation instead, makes
everything run smoothly enoug

Merely Spontaneous

The threatened “rebellion” was
termed as being "merely sponta-
neous combustion." ,

“The freshmen objected to be-
ing improved in the final three
weeks of school. They wanted in-
stead a constructive program. The
later has been arranged," Osborn
stated.

Neither faction would admit
that the . settlement had been
reached through arbitration.

Porter Not Consulted

DWight Porter, president of the
Council of House Presidents, men’s
governing body which has been 'ln
charge of the “Improvement Day”
program, said that while he had
heard rumors of the disturbance,
he had not been consulted.

“However," he said. ”measures
will be applied to see that all
freshmen participate in the pro-
gram."
