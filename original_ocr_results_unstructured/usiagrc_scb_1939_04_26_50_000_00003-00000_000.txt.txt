'Des Moines Job
Survey Will Be
Informal'uPooIey

The Des Moines job survey will
be conducted on an informal basis
this year, according to plans be-
ing formulated by John w. Poo-
ley.

Under the new arrangement,
the formal group survey will be
supplanted by individual trips ar-
ranged by the individual with the
aid of the appointment bureau.

The reason for the new plan is
to avoid the protracted absence
from the college which a formal
job survey would require.

All seniors who are interested
should apply to the appointment
bureau before the end of the
week
