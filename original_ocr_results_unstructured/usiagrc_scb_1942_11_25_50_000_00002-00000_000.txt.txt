A Case Of Myopia--—

Grinnell’s delegates to the Midwest athletic
conference convention, held in Chicago this
past past week-end. have now carried home
the information that the conference voted
down a motion to repeal the “llo—lreshman”
rule. The proposed change would have per-
mitted freshman participation in varsity
basketball this coming season.

Reportedly, Grinnell. Cornell, and Col:
were the only schools favoring relaxation
of the rule. It will be remembered tllat

being very short-sighted about freshman
participation. Perhaps they are taking the
view that they. as individual schools, have
not so much to gain from relaxation of the
rule as do their rival schools; perhaps they
first took inventory of their freshman ma—
teral, and voted in accordance with the
gain they might expect”

As a matter of fact. the improvement of
their own athletic fortunes was hardly con-
sideration of the schools ‘i'ostci‘ ng the
movement to permit freshman participation
ili varsity basketball. The major concern
was not so materialistically objective. These
three schools. Grinnell among them, feel
that it is only a measure of fairness to
freshman athletic hopefuls to grant them
the opportunity to participate in varsity
athletics before the time comes when they
must leave school to take up wartime duties.
And that piece of reasoning strikes us as
being most justf

ln voting down the change. however.
the other conference schools may have
done something more far-reaching and sig»
nificant than to deny the thrill of varsity
participation to freshman athletes. It is
possible that they may have signed the
death warrant of athletics in the Midwest
conference. We have no assurance that
many of our varsity men will not be called
into active service before the end of the
coming basketball season; nor do these'
other schools.

In that event, freshman participation
notlld be the only solution to the problem
of continuance of intercollegiate athletics
within the: colifcrence.

Grinnell took the same stand in regard to
freshman participation in football.
our position is quite clear»cut.
