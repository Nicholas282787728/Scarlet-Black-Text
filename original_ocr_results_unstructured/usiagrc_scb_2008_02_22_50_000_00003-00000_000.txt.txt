BYALEX CoNLoN

Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld, Jon Stewart:
What do they have in common? They are all
connected to this week’s symposium.

Beginning this Sunday, Feb. 24, ﬁve speaks
ets will address these questions of identity
from various disciplines in a weeklong sympo»
sium entitled “Judaism and Popular Culture."
The symposium is sponsored primarily by the

Each speaker m the event will address a (life
fcrent aspect of popular culture, with a heavy
focus on periormanee art The speakers will
consider Judaism as it i-elnces ro rheirre, televi-
sion, media and women in popular culture. All
of the lecturers l’lilll from Midwestern inSUﬂk
rions and organizations

Members ofChalutzim and Rabbi Davccn
Lirwm hope the symposium will be oi’inreresr
to both Jews and non-Jews alike. Litwin said it
will ptovrdc “a good opporrumry for students
to learn abour something that is nor a part or
Grinnell's curriculum," espccielly “the evolving
experience oi‘ Jews in American pop culrure."

“Until reeenrly, [Icing Jewish in populai
cullun: was at besr being identiﬁed 1 Either,”
said Limin, She lyclicvcs rhis perception has
changed mro a posirive, an idenriry to be “one
braced, not hidden."

The symposium will begin with two acu~

demics, followed by a rabbi, a playwright and
a screenwriter, Co-leader of Chalutzim Abby
Rapoporr '08, also co-editur-in-chief of the
we played a large role in contacting speakers
and organizing the events and hopes that the
speakers diverse backgrounds will allow rhere
to be “something for everyone."

Rapoporr said that Chalutzim d the
event would increase the group‘s vi ity on
campus and “let people know that Chalumm
offers more than just Shabbut table."

Franklc '03, an active Cabinet member of
Clmlutzim, said that anorhei- morimrion be-
hind the upcoming symposium Was the state
of Judaism on campus. anlsle said, “a lot of
pcoplc m College rend to feel less religiously
Jewish and more socially Jewish" She hopes
rlie symposium will . ,e Chalurzlm'snsibiliry
on campus, hoping “that people will see rhnr
we’re doing .r and iclncmbet thatwe [Chalue
zimj exist."

Although ihc idea (or [hc symposium was
ocnerlted bl Challitzim members the event
