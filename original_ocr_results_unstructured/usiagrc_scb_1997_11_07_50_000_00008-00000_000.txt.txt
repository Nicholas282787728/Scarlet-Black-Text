After subduing Illinois College
last Saturday, 64-49, in a scoring
barrage, tlle Grinnell College foot-
ball team impioved its
record to 5-4 and achieved
its l'irst winning season in
27 years.

Throughout the season
the Pioneers have proved
a vreal deal willi their con-
sislent play. Now the
griddcrs have the opportu-
iiity to become Midwest
Conference champions
when they host Carroll in
the title grime til l:00 on
Saturday. Pioneer tans are
expected to provide an mV
tense and cxc' ing atmosphere.

“This was a big win tor us.” re.
marked ali elllhustasitic Coach
Greg Wallace after Grinnell's
iliiprcsivc win over Illillois Cole
lege. “With tlils win ,we attained
our first winnlng season in practir
cally lhlce decades and also
claimed the south division crown
outright."

The Pioneers were led by quar~
lerhack ’froy Dougherty, who tied
it“ NCAA Division III record with

eight touchdown strikes.
“Daugherty was outstanding,"

praised Wallace, “We had a great

combination of passing and runs

ninu which enabled Troy to go

deep. He was really on the mark."

The Pioneers racked up 655 to
tal yards, including 399 through
the air. Dougherty personally ac-
complished 387 yards on 20
completions in 28 attempts with 2
interceptions.

Wade Krause and Davrd Snider
led the gridders in receiving,
Krause had 5 catches for 152 yards
and 3 touchdowns. Snider finished
with 5 catches for 115 yards and 2
TD's. lake Boyer hauled in 4

completions for 61 yards and 2
scores, while Richard Werner also
grabbed 4 for 53 yards and a
touchdown,

Jim Hart carried the brunt of

l the running attack, com-

piling 103 yards and con»
vetting his first-ever rushr
ing TD. Many ofllie holes
through which he ran were
created by linemen Mike
Fischer and Mark Hund,
both of whom Wallace
praised for their perfor-
manees.

The Pioneers hope to
continue this offensrve
display when they take on
the most stingy defense in
the conference. Carroll

has held its opponents to only 254
yards per game with just 100 in
the air.

“We will have our work cutout
for us." remarked Wallace, “We
are glad to be representing the
south division, but once you get
this far you want to win it all. We
will have to be sharp and disci—
plined, We are excited. so I am
confident that we will be ready to
give it all we've got to bring a
championship to Grinnell."

Women’s soccer team
loses heartbreaker to

end season

BY SETH KLEIMAN
Sports Information

The Grinnell College women’s
soccer team fell in a disappointing
271 loss to St. Norbert last Saturday,
The loss eiids its season and with it
the hope of repeating as Midwest
Conference champions. However,
the Pioneers fought a solid battle at
the league playoffs.

At St. Norbert the kickers came
out playing conﬁdently and had a
strong defensive effort. It was a see
saw struggle early on as both teams
possessed the ball with authority and
skill.

After 27 minutes St. Norbert
scored on a 25ryard shot to take the
lead. This l-O score remained gen
ing into the half.

"I was pleased with our effort in
the first half,” remarked Coach
Jenny Wood. “We knew we had the
chance to really play a ‘team game’
and we were executing that, Unforr
tunately, they just got offa deep shot
that penetralcd our goal. We knew
that we were going to have to play
hard to get that goal back and we
did just that "

In the second half the Pioneers
Weie fired up and peppered the op-
posing goal frequently and early.

Kickers get clutch victory over Monmouth but

lose to undefeated Ripon' in tourney

Entering the season Grinnell Col-
lege veteran Coach John Pfitsch
hoped his men‘s soccer team could
keep its string of Midwest Confer-
ence playo appearances alive. Af-
ter a rough start. the Pioneers really
yelled In the Illsl five conference
games to earn a berth in the four-
tellrn league tournament,

"We were in a different situation
than usual,” commented Pl'ltsch
"We only had four retulnillg Slitrlr
ers and one all-conference player
coming back "

Coach Pfitsch molded his team
around a group or veterans who had
some varsity playing experience
and a host of newcomers. After

starting the season with a Z— 2 league
record, the Pioneers won four of
their last livc regular-season confer
ence games.

"I was disappointed with our scar
son until the Beloit game," explained
Pﬁlsch The Pioneers nipped Beloil,
1-0, on the road. "We seemed to
come together then and played very
well the remainder of the season."

Last week the Pioneers needed a
victory over Monmouth to be invited
to the conference tournament Afr
ter drawing 0-0 during the first half,
Grinnell knocked home two goals in
the second period to advance to the
tourney.

About 10 minutes into the second
half rookie John Pallnski wove

lllrough the Scot defense to score it
solo goal from 10 yards out. /\ few
minutes lalel William Lee-Ashley
knocked home a score underneath
the cross bar off the second bounce
of a throw-in.

Pfilsch noted. "We kept good
pressure on Monmouth all day and
a lot_of credit for that goes to
midfielder Zach Goldman He
played a very aggressiie game "

Grinnell was the No. 4 seed fol
the conference tournament. drawing
undefeated Ripon at Ripon l ‘
Redhawks came away with a 371

number of hi iglit spots

Rookie goalie Davin Dalll and
defendcrlocl Fclkey won praise for

playing an outstanding game.
Dnlil was fantastic in the net, He
probably saved 25 or 30 shots,"
explained Pl’iisch

Orilillcll's goal came off a free
kick III the last five minutes of the
game. Senior defender Sclh
chiinan scored the only goal of
his career as he knocked home the
goal into the upper left corner,

“We have only six seniors
graduating and our rookies gained
some lcally valuable experience
llllS fall, I lhlilk we are going to
he solid next year, I'm tremenr
dously pleased that we kept fight-
ing timing the middle and end of
the season instead offading,"con»
eluded Plllsch

“Although the
outcome was not
what we wanted,
we played a
fantastic game.”
~ Coach Jenny Wood

Eventually Juliana Seraﬁni rocketed
a shot past the keeper with 26 min-
utes left to tie the score.

It appeared as ifthe game would
go into overtime, as it had the last
time these two teams played, but the
Pioneers suffered a defensive breaks
down and fouled a player with 1:40
to play. St. Norbert converted the
free kick and took the final lead, 27
l,

The kickers managed to still get
three shots off before time expired,
but it was not enough and the Pio-
neers failed to advance to the cham-
pionship game.

“Although the outcome was not
what we wanted, we played a fan-
tastic game and our players truly be-
lieve that," commented Wood.

The Pioneers ended the season at
7rl0 overall, 772 in the conference
regular season.

“Obvtously we are disappointed
with the losing record because we
have certain standards and expecta~
hens in this program." said Wood.
“1 think the real disappointment lies
in the fact that we did have people
work hard in the offseason and the
results were not manifested as wins.
However, we do have a clear picture
ot‘whal we need to work on for next
year and we know the positions we
will need to fill."

Senior starters who will be
missed next season include Maura
Bartel, Sally Goodspecd, Emily
Marlin, Jill Paulsen and Sarah Slack,

“I was pleased to have these pl ay-
ers contribute. Next year’s players
should benefit greatly from the les-
sons alld experience gained this sea
sort.” concluded Wood.
