Wow. It has been a whopping rlirce weeks sinee l'vc lasr
reviewed alames Ellroy book. I think I’m starring to suffer from
a littlewithdrawal. But I’ve kcpr my promise: so fat. (For rhosc
ofyou who don’t recall, l swore lwouldn’r rcvicw another one of
his books this semester lest he become a case
or overkill.) Anyway, rhe subyccr or rhis
week's review is a relatively obscure book en-
titled Editm’r Chaim by William Kane. It is
a smart satire about a committee ofeditors
rhat meddle: with their columnlsrs' articles
in order to suppress eerrain srones nnd in.
sread express rheir own opinions regarding
prescnt»day issues. I don’r know that I’d go
so far as to say rhar I liked this book, burl
was dchnirely amused by ir. Kane docs o
inasrcriul job orwenving momenrs ofplayr
ful rcnsion wirh serious commentary, bur
rhc problem was rhar rhe commcnrnry was iusr so damned cli»
ched. Perhaps I should roll you somcrhing orrlic plor nnd how
rhc commenrary ﬁts inro said plor before 1 deal wirh speciﬁc
nspecrs ofthc novel,

Michael Gerring is a newly hircd columnisr for rhe ciry pil-
per, He's young, idealisric, and rarhcr unrurored in the ways or
rhc world, But he’s a dam good wrirer end he alwuys gers his
srory He gers ilong with his bosses and co-workcrs and keeps ro
his rark. All rhis begins ro change, however, when cerring reads
one of his article: and realize: that his wording has been altered
iusr enough nor ro drzlw a grear deal ofattentlon ro irself, bur ro
convey a differenr meaning rhan he wrote. Michael wrires it off
as just a mishap, and connnues wriring arricles for die paper.
For iicarlya year he doesn’t run inro any more problems unnl he
is asked ro cover recenr milirary aggression in rhc Middle East.
Gerring wrires a srory condemning rhe unnecessary force and
bruraliry underraken in the overseas campaign, however rhe next
day hc sees an arriclc under his name rhar insrend praises rhe
counrry's military tactics! Gerring is or coursc furious and he
immediarely speaks wirh his managing ediror who inform him

 

The author never identi»
ﬁes where his story takes
place, instead allowing
his reader to associate the
story with a speciﬁc city
and government.

Book Review: Editor’s Choice

rhar rhe article prinred was rhc article Gerring had delivered.
Urrcrly dumbsrnrck, Michael leaves the orricc and runs inro a
wrirer who has worked or rlie paper for all his lire. Michael
asks him ubour rhe arnclcs being changed, and rhe older mnn
replies rhrr rhc cdirors “make rhc srories righr.” Michael storms
our orand spends rlic resr orrhe day and well inro rhc evening
fuming about what he’s learned Later (hilt nighr, Michael
overlicnrs rwo people commciuing on rho
accuracy and inrclligenee or his arriclc.
Getting snips and arracks rhcin. Within
minutes, the rwo people are unconscious
and Gerring is becoming progressively more
unhinged. He winds up back rir his ofﬁce.
where he breaks in and cavesdrops on rhe
board ofeditors and warches rhcm change
rhe arriclrs For rhe nerr day's paper. Jusr is
he is about ro leave, a janitor discovers him
rind brings before rhe bosses, Here Michael
delivers ii wonderfully melodramaric spiel
about nrnsric inregriry rind how rlre edirors
arevioliring his righrs as a wrirer. Surricc to say rhc edirors are
unmoved. In her, rhey are so unmoved that rhey injecr him
with some unknown concoction that resulrs in brain dcarh.
Before his mind succumbs ro rhc poison, Gerring manages ro
urrcr one lrisr phrase or resistance; “Quit changing my ar-
ticlesl”

Kane never idcnriries where his srory takes place, instead
ullowing his reader ro associate rhe srory wirh u speciﬁc ciry
and governmcnr. The problem, is i said earlier, is how his.
raiir Kane's commenrnry is. His message abour misinforma-
rion and suppression or‘knuwledge (a la orwell's 19am is just
a lirrle roo prominenr. The aurhor would have donc qulte
well ro have made his critique a bir more subrle insrend or
beating us abour rhe head wirh his message, But ir seems
rhar‘s rhe only way some people can actually comprehend a
messnge, so rhe public on the whole my be able ro pardon
him. sore, ir carries an imporranr message (000! were all or
rhe mercy orcensorship by our superiors! Freedom olsprcchz
Bah!), bur who's really inrcresrcd in messages, anyway. To me,
rhoiigli, ir was iusr a mediocre book.
