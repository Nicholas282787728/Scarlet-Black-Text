charges

Administration says that pro-
cedures are not changing, but

some students disagree

Grinnell police arrested four students in a Younker
Pit room on Monday, March 14, ilccoldlng to Secu~
rit_v ieports and sources close to the incident.

Dan Brown ‘05, Arie Pearson ‘07, Marcus Crcnialr
di ‘07 and Bay Carton ‘05 wcrc arrested on campus,
taken downtown and issued tickets and court dates
for drug related chaiges, according to police reports.

The arrests and other actions trigger-ed critical
reactions from students about the college's security
and police involvement policies, but administrators
maintain that no proceduial changes have occuried
in iecentyears.

According to Pearson. Cremaldi and police re
ports, someone called Security, who then called the
police, Officers came to the dorm and knocked on
doors in Younker pit, but, ﬁnding no one, they left.
Police, accompanied by security, returned later and
made the arrests.

Pearson said he was not sure exactly who contacts
ed Security “I can’t imagine it was anyone on my ﬂoor
but who knows anymore," he said. “I feel like I can’t
trust anyone.”

Police were also contacted in another incident the
previous week involving the burning of ﬂiers in the
South Campus loggia, according to the Security inci-
dent report.

25 students

each year, int

on and off
campus arrests, and this number has not rollowed any
upward or downward trend, Vice President for Stur

“it varies. It does come in waves, like in any com-
munity," Marherly said, but ”we haven‘t seen a real
spike in arrests recently."

Security's annual crime statistics report, available
online at the Security office’s website, cites no drug
arrests in 2001 or 2002 and one in 2003, the last year
for which the report is available. There have been at
least five arrests for drug offences ofstudents this se-
mester.

[Wainrigh] arrested for Plan post

Sophomore student how on bail after being charged with 'threat of terrorism’

5v Atv BEERV

On Thursday, March 24, Paul Wainright ‘07 was arrested in
Milwaukee, Wise, and officially charged under the Iowa Code for
threats of terrorism. Because the arrest warrant was issued by the
Grinnell Police Department, Waintight was extradited to Iowa sev-
eral days after his arrest.

He was released on bail this week and returned to classes yesr
terday, Waiiiright said that he was very happy to be back on campus
and appreciative of the support of both Grinnellians and friends in
Milwaukee, but he could not talk about any speciﬁcs regarding his
case.

' According to the Grinncll Police Department’s March 25 press
release, the ariest was the result ot’a complaint that the police re-
ceived on March 22 regarding a “threatening
communication.” The communication was later
identiﬁed as ‘t\ message posted at the bottom of
wainright’s Plan,

Tom Cindy, tricopresident tor student sci»
viccs,snid that the college administration had his
rot-med the police about the post after receiving
some complaints from members ofrhc Giinncll
community. “Any time an individual is threat»
tried, or a group is threatened, to be murdered,
we’ve always let them know." said Crady, “We
cannot take a threat lightly. We have to takc it
seriously in any circumstance."

Crady said that both he and Jennifer Ki'ohn, dcan for Student
Life, received ii number ofeniails following the arrest from students
asking why the administiation had not confionted Wainriglit prior
to contacting the police.

“The issue tor us really was that there was an eucoutagcmcnt {or
other pcople to bring Icthiil weapons back to campus and kill the
police and kill quote ‘Narcs’on campus,” he said. “From whatl hear
from Paul‘s friends, he seems like a good guy. on the other hand,

we have a campus of 1500, and we’ve heard from faculty, staff and
students who are scared about this, so there's an element offear that
we don't need right now.” ,

Cassie Donnell)! ‘06, who heard about the arrest in an email from
Wainright’s sister, posted what she knew about the situation on her
Plan and encouraged Plan readers to infoim others by linking other
to her Plan. By Saturday, dozens of Plans contained references to
Wainright’s arrest.

Some students expressed frustration that Wainright's post wasn't
read more careﬂllly. or read in the context of the rest of his Plan,
which mentioned that he hoped students would enjoy their breaks
and “get their rest on."

Friends of Wainright credited his sarcastic sense of humor as
being the reason for the post and expressed
frustration that he was not given an opportu-
nity to explain the joke before the police were

‘ involved.

“I think the first course ofiict‘toii should've
been to call [wtiiiiiglrt],“ said Donnelly. “1
mean, ﬁnd out what it tvas, particularly since
I’aul meant no threat."

Griiinell Police Chicflody Mathcrly, hoWV
ever, said that the police department could not
considei context when faced with what they
viewed as .1 serious threi “The law is clear
that if incidences occur that break the law,

we don't look at friendships and stutflike that," he said. “We owed
it to the Giinnell college students, faculty, security, giounds crew,
everyone on campus, and outside the coucgc, to do something so
that no one would get hurt."

Other admin tots, including President Russell Osgood, have
been fielding qucs ions as to the perceived increase in police in-
volvemeilt in campus issues.
