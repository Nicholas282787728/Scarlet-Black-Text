BVJORDAN SCHEIBEL ‘

20 miles southwest of Grinnell and 30
minutes away by car, sully is a town ofa lit—
tle under a thousand with a small downtown
dwarfed by the massive grain elevators of the
Sully Cosop Exchange that rise to the south.
The Coffee Cup Cafe, however, has earned
a reputation that outgrows this town’s small
size and relative anonymity, in no small part
because of its pie.

Ed Levine ’73, a Grinnell alum and
founder of Senbusiamcom, lists the Coffee
Cup as one of 10 great places in the United
States to eat pie in a recent article in USA
Today (he discovered the Coffee Cup while
attending Grinnell). When RAGBRAI

(Register’s Annual Great Bike. Ride Across ’

Iowa) passed through here in 2005, Tour
de France winner Lance Armstrong was at
the Coffee Cup eating a piece ofpie, as the
many photographs and newspaper clippings
on the bulletin board at the restaurant can
attest.

The Coffee Cup's local and national
reputation is built on more than just pie
though~as their menu says, they take“ ex-
treme pride" in alltheir made from—scratch
cooking.” The cafe is ranked by the Des
Moines Register, as one of 100 places to eat

before you die and named one of 500 best -

places to eat before its too late in the book
Road Food.

Tucked into a short row of businesses
on one of Sully’s main streets, the Coffee
Cup is a small place, a few booths and tables
squeezed 'into the main dining room,wellslit
by awide front window. In the sort ofinduss
trial furnishing that you might be familiar
with from The ASLM Cafe, indicative of the
building’s relatively recent past (the Coffee
cup was founded in 1970), the ceiling and
the front of the bar are made of sheets of
gray corrugated metal.

lettuce, and the 3 1b ‘cowboy Burger served
on Texas toast for $7. In fact everything on
the menu was 57 or less, and all the appetiz-
ers were 54 or less.

After our main dishes, we got straight
to the ie. We tried healthy slices of banana
cream urportedly theirbest kind) German
chocolate and rhubarb, 52.25 each, hoping
to get a good sampling of their pie variety.
The banana cream was a slight disappoint-
ment for its lofty reputation, but the Gers

man chocolate, and especially the rhubarb,
were fantastic.

I think the Coffee Cup is worth visiting
multiple times just to see what pie they’re
offering. The cheap menu, great pie and
comfortable, local feel make this an excels
lent place for an out—of-Grinnell excursion,
for breakfast, lunch or dinner (make sure you
check their hours and remember to bring
cash). Plan on going there soon, ifnot before
you graduate, than at least before its too late.
