MIISIB scene

We want you to Know...

To the Editor:

I realize that much has been written in
the past about music at Grinnell but after
reading the recent Public Events Commit-
tee notice in the last issue of the Scarlet and
Black, i feel mat it is necessary to bring the
subject up again.

In the Sept. 11 issue of the Scarlet and
Black it was stated, in the article about the
SGA budget, that an effort is being made to
get a “wider variety or concerts tin order)
to satisty a wider variety or student in-
terests.” Well, it looks as ii this goal of
musical diversity is being achieved. With
the upcoming performances oi Luther
Allison, me Piper Road Spring Band, .lim
Post and Gary Burton, people whose
musical tastes run from blues and jazz to
bluegrass and folk are undoubtedly being
satisfactorily accommodated.

However, it appears that in attempting to
appeal to extremes the committees con-
cerned are ignoring the musical
mainstream, Nowhere have i seen any in

dication that orinnell is going to be host to
a band that plays good old rock and roll or
good new rock and roll for that matter. I
know that there are myriad reasons why
this condition exists, chief among them be
ing the high fee charged hy rock bands,
Yet, I iind it very diliicult to believe that
there are no bands out there which we can
aiiort‘l or which would be willing to play in
Darby. i do not expect the Rolling Stones or
Bruce Springsteen to schedule us on their
next tour but what about the innumerable
good regional bands or even local bands out
or Chicago? I also cannot imagine mat
many of the new and talented English and
American new wave groups are popular
enough to charge excessive lees. I am
speaking here of groups or the caliber of the
Grinnell-era Police and Ultravox

In short, I feel that as a lover oi rock and
new wave, I am being cheated out or my
share of musical entertainment at Grinnell,
I simply ask that rock be given due atten-
tion in the consideration of this ”Wider
variety oi student interests." Sincerely
yours, Eva Baroth

To the Editor:

Last week the 55:3 incorrectly stated
that Jim Post was scheduled to appear
again this year. As of now he has not been
contracted. Next week a survey will be
distributed to the students to help us deter
mine their opinions about various groups
and artists under consideration. We look
iorward to receiving those responses to

help us in selecting the remainder or this
year's concerts. Sincerely, Pete Fry and
Bennett Lasko. Concert Chairmen

To the Editor:

What a surprise to discover in last week's
edition oi this rag that I'm not a student
here at Grinnell. And (or the past three
years, 1 had sincerely thought otherwise.
Well, this does present some problems, now
doesn't it? I mean, besida the {act that I'm
close to completing two majors and was
kind of hoping to graduate in the spring and
be done with this place tthough dear it has
been to mel, think of the letdown it's going
to be {or the treasurer’s oifice when they
have to give back all that nice money my
folks have been so earnestly paying them
these past four autumns. After all, It your
Mr Lenk is trying to tell me that he knows

something I don't, I guess l'll just have to
take the hint and go, since what good will it
do to stay when I can‘t even shake George
Drake's hand in May" oh, well. iguess I
can go back to trimming trees and bushes
(but not putting up iences — never touch
'em), Atter all, lots or people make good
wrthout going too far in hie — like
newspaper reporters . — Mark
Lawrence, Class or '3277

vs.» oh, and to whoever decided to
climb the tree by the bookstore — thanks a
lot tor the broken branch, It helps to make
the summer's work really worthwhile .

Editorial note: The 5&3 apologires tor
the error.
