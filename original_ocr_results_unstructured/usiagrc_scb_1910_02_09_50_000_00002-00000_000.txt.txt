It is earnestly to he hoped that the
day of prayer which has been set apart
tomoriou pill be obseri ed in the spirit
in which it is given uud ivill ilot be
taken merely as an opportunity to tie
things for uliith there i iioi time on
other day - In older that this ill‘tellr
lion may he ri-alized it is necessar
that not on a low hilt :11 ot the stir
dent bm‘y enter into the spirit oi the
day and inalie it "not a holiday but a
holy day." The faculty has arranged
to have a special speaker here tor the
occasion; the classes will rill hold meet-
lugs and a general attempt will be
made to make it a real day or piarer
tor the college.
