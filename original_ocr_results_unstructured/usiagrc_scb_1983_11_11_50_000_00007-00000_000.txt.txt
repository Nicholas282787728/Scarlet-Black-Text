Soccer finishes oﬂ season

by Eric a. Lusk

In 1980 Grinnell Soccer coadl John
Pfistch started the team on a new track:
upgrading the soccer program and the
quality of the opponents. It was an am-
bitious undertaking, but then that was an
ambitious team. The Pioneers went on to
the Conference Championship game but
lost to Lake Forest.

During the 1933 season, the Pioneers
posted a 75-2 record, The opponenu in
their schedule were better than in past
years, but as Pfitsch said, “We don't need
to be intimidated anymore.” Despite the
good season, Grinnell bowed to Lake
Forest in the Conference Finals once
again, but not until the game went into
overtime for a 2-0 loss. The 10$ was a
small matter to Pfitsch. ”This season has
capsulized a goal of achieving what we set
out to do: upgrading our program.”

Indeed, the Grinnell soccer team played
such notables as Colorado College (Pfitsch
called that team the best he has EVER
SEEN IN COLLEGE SOCCER). MacMur-
ray, Wheaton, Trinity, and Brandeis
(ranked [(5 nationally). “We’re convinced
we can play representative soccer,”
Pfitsch Said,

Pfitsch said that the style of the team's
play was to use the defense long enough to
get a breakaway opportunity, While the
tactic failed in the Lake Forest game, it
worked well in others. Possibly that sort of
defensive reliance will not be needed next
year, Freshman forward Tom Eissenberg,
noted for his candor, said, ”Once the for
ward line gets going, we‘ll be a complete

with another player at their last home game, on Oct.

With the start of the 1984 season will
come a new start and new faces. Regret-
tably, itmeans that the soccer team will be
wiﬂ'zout Co-Captain John Gerry, Eric
Pedicini, two time All-Conference goalie
Greg Donovan, and three time All-
Conference fullback Henry York-Steiner
(Donovan and Steiner will probably be
able to extend that to three and four years
after the conference coaches’ meeting
sometime next week). Sophomore Steve
Nash (winner of the most Improved
Player Award) said, “It’s going to be hard
to replace four starting seniors which in
cluded an All-Conference goalie."
Donovan got the Most Valuable Player
Award for a reason.” CoCaptain Chip
Maxson, a junior, said, “They [the
seniors] did a lot this season, They were
moral support, ood to have around.”

Coach Pfitsch emphasized the leader-
ship contributions of two-year covcaptain
Gerry, Donovan’s consistent excellence,
and Yorksteiner's defensive skills. Of
YorkeSteiner, Pfitsch said, “Pound for
pound he’s the best wing fullback I‘ve ever
had, l-le’s as good as any lullhack in the
league.” Pfitsch felt special remorse at
losing these four seniors who were on his
team at the beginning of his new opponent
schedule. “I get sentimental about seniors
at the end of a season. These four seniors
have been playing on varsity for four
years.” (Donovan, in his freshman year,
had to shift on and off with the then star-
ting senior goalie).

Co-Captains John Gerry and chip Max-
son were pleased with the season. Gerry
defined the team’s goal at the start of the
season as a berth at the Conference Cham-
pionships, which the team did easily with a
4-0 record in Grinnell’s conference. For
Maxson the goal was also achieved: “If
everything went right we would have done
just as well as we did. It did go right.”

The players felt that much of the credit
should go to Pfitsch. Freshman midfielder
Jon Smith said, “I liked what Pfitsdi did in
terms of visualization. He gets to know the
player and pushes the player from there.
He sets you up lor the game.” Senior
goalie Donovan was able to give a more
time-considered View: “He’s learned a lot
in four years. lwas particularly impressed
with his enthusiasm. l-le integrated soccer
from a club sport to a Varsity team,”
Gerry said, “He gets as psyched up, if not
more, than we do for the games."

Next year’s team will not be short on
talent. it the 1984 season began tomorrow,
without the help of the seniors. Plitsch
said, “I can start a Very fine ball club,"
Tom Elssenherg said, “If the goalie situa-
tion works out we'll go Just as far if not lur-
ther next season." Gerry was also op-
tilnistic, “I imagine the next two years the
team will get a lot better." The Pioneer
soccer team, after all, had five freshmen,
eight to ten sophomores, and three juniors,
For a young team, a 7572 record looks like
the beginning.

M artmek leads

team to victory

From College News Service

Kevin Murphy kicked a 32-yard field
goal into the wind with 15 seconds remain-
ing to give Grinnell College a come-from-
behind $7 football victory over Illinois Col-
lege at Rosenbloom Field Saturday.

”It’s a victory I will remember the rest
of my life,” proclaimed an elated John
Martinek after completing his first year as
head coach ol the Pioneers and gaining his
initial Midwest Conference win.

Martinek called it “Murphy's best kick
of the season” and added, ”Kevin really
put his foot into the ball. It would have
been good if it had been a 52-yard kick."

Prospects for a Grinnell victory ap-
peared dim after ﬁle Pioneers got the ball
on downs on their own 32»yard line with one
ly 1:48 showing on the clock.

A al-yard pitch from Arnie Bryson to
Carmen Trotta advanced the ball to the II-
linois College 37 and another Bryson
aerial, this one to Scott Stauffer, moved it
to the 15.

Three carries by Trotta gave Grinnell a
fourth and one situation on the 16, and
Murphy split the uprights alter a time out,

After nearly 25 minutes of scoreless foot
ball, the Pioneers suddenly struck the
game’s first tally.

Bryson and Tom Hanseter hooked up on
a perfect 65~yard pass like you see the pros
execute on TV on Sunday afternoon. It was
Grinnell's longest play of the campaign.

Murphy‘s extra point kick was blocked

Illinois College retaliated late in the se-
cond quarter after recovering a Grinnell
fumble on the Pioneer 28, John Sawickis
immediately passed to John Barker for a
TD and Denis Boisclair kicked the extra
point for a 7d ulinois college lead.

It stayed that way until Grinnell's late
heroics as both clubs spent most of the
third and fourth quarters skilled in their
own territory.

Grinnell had a scoring opportunity late
in the third act after Chris Taylor captured
an Illinois College fumble on the Blueboy
35.

A Bryson to Hanseter pass gave Grinnell
a first down on the five, but a penalty sent
the ball back to the 10, The Pioneers were
still on the in four plays later, and the wind
blew a Murphy field goal attempt from the
17 off course.

Martinek praised the Grinneli defense
for “playing super all day" andfor “really
shutting down Phil Polhman."

Polhman went into the game as the
Midwest Confernce‘s leading rusher, but
netted only 85 yards on 31 carries.

The punting of Stauffer was another pc-
tent Grinnell weapon, He averaged 40
yards on seven boots and lofted a sseyarder
that rolled dead on the Illinois College
seven. Other Stauffer punts set the visitors

back to meir own seven, eight and ll.

Bryson netted 57 yards on seven pass
completions, and all seven earned first
downs.

Trotta was the ground leader, with 63
yards in 19 tries. He also had a 45-yard
kickoti return.

Playing its 95th year of intercollegiate
football, Grinnell closed with an overall 2-7
record and a l-4 mark in Midwest Con-
ference South Division action.
