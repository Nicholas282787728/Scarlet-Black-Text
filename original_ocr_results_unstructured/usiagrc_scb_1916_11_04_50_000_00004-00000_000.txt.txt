Although the Drake game today
comes immcdiaicly after the 5 week
cxams, ilicrc . not a member on the
squad who will hc ineligible on ac.
count of “coils." This high scholastic
i-ccord is a mark which the squad
should ha proud or.

For the iirst time since he has been
on the squad. Captain Bari-cit will be
tor-cod to witness a game from the
sidelines on account of injuries,

From all done available on today‘s
game, the contest should resolve it—
self into a punting duel. On this ac;
count. the ability of "Mike" Augustine
to punt will have much to .do with
the resulting score.

Do you know that the cntirc squad
is riding on this “Special" to Des
Moines’! This is the first time this
year that every member is heing taken
on a trip.

Jesse Day has not been allowed by
his physician to participate in sci m—
magc this week because of the intern-
al injury he received Tuesday.
Georgo lchlmuu is not eli ible tor-
today's game. because he has not hood
in school a full year. All univoi es
rcquirc that the one year residence
rule be ciiiorccd by their opponents.

the mum of Coach Glnzc or Drake, He
did not want to take chances or have
ing any of his pet play . icd irpon
by any one who might ”lip” ilicm off
to Giiiincli.

Ralph Glaze seems to have inoculat-
ed the Bulldogs with a lighting spirit
that they hare lacked for the last few
years. Added to this “Ilglit” iu the
team, there has boon an increase in
the "pop“ among the students at
Drake. Chapels have been hold daily
at tho unire Sit)! in order to generate
more enthusiasm among the student
body.

It will take the lull lung capacity or
the Gi-iiiiiell 'rooters to cutycll the
Drake supporters. with their revival oi
"pep." Drake. by tho way, is rising
mogaphoncs.
