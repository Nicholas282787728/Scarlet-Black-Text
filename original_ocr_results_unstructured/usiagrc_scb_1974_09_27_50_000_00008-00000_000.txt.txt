Plonccrs played the hometowners
even through the rest at the lust
half, with each team scoring once.

Grinnell’s only goal came during
one of the several flurrles in front
oi the Knox goal, Atter a series ol
shotsronrgoal and rebounds, right
winger Dave Wynberg riiled the
ball by the Knox goalie, knotting
the game at 1-1. It was Wynberg’s
third goal or the young season,

Knox moved back into the lead,
however, just before halftime with
a beautifully executed head off a
corner kick.

The second half was Characr
terlzed by rough, scrambling
defense and general strong play by
both sides Both teams failed on
several scoring attempts, much to
the chagrin of the large Galesburg
Crowd.

Very much in the game until
near the end, Grinnell's back was
broken by a Knox score with three
minutes remaining The two goals
that lollowed in succession, the last
being tabulated with but nine
seconds tell in the contest, were
after the fact. Grinnell had lost.

Despite a strong team per
formance, Grinnell’s cross country
team failed to crack the top 15 in
the team standings at the powers
packed Luther Invitational last
weekend.

Dave Raub led all Pioneer
runners finishing 32nd with a time
of 20:52. This time would have
placed him 14th in the same race
one year ago,

Coach Ray obermiller was very
pleased with his team's showing.
“Tom l-lowland, Neal Klegerman,
Tim DeCoster and Dale Wol'ley all
ran the fastest four-mile race of
their careers.” Obermiller also
lauded Bob Shields and Russ
Damtoft tor good races,

teams in the midwest when they

culminating a drive that began
alter a short Lake Forest punt.
Quarterback Paul Crane plunged
over from the oneryard line on a
sneak play. The kick ior the extra
point was blocked, but Grinnell got
another chance as the Flaming
Reds were penalized on the play.
The second kick \vcnt wide and
Grinnell had a 64) lead.

quarter and scored the tying
touchdown on quarterback Steve
Harris 19 yard pass to wingback
Dan Cantanzaro. Harris then ran
tor the eroint conversion and Lake
Forest had an are lead which they
still held at halftime.

Harris’ passing kept Lake Forest
in the game as he threw tor a total
of 169 yards. The Pioneer delensive
squad did intercept thrre of his
aerials, however, .
Grinnell had a touchdown Called
back in the iirst half because uf an
oiiensive infraction and later
missed a short tield goal attempt.
The Lake Forest ottciise was
pretty well shut oil by a tenacious
Grinnell dciciise and alter the way
the Pioneers had dominated the
lirst hall it appeared that they
would romp in the second hall.

Lake Forest increased their
lead. in the third quarter, to 14-6
when quarterback Harris again
passed to his back Cantanzaro. this
connection good tor 33 yards and a
touchdown, The attempt tor the 2-
point conversion was stopped.

Lake Forest moved better in the
second half but Grinnell continued
to apply pressure nonetheless, The
Pioneer defense played tough the
remainder oi the game giving Lake
Forest little in the air and less on
the ground, but the offense con
tinued to come up emptyrhanded a 3
drives [ell just short.

Conversion tails

Finally halfback Mark Bowman
punched the ball over irom the 3-
yard line for Grinnell‘s second
score, late in the fourth quarter. It
was Bowman's third touchdown
this season, putting him in second
place in individual scoring in the
Conference. The Pioneers went for
the tie, but were stopped short oi
the goal on their try ior two points.

With time running out Grinnell
again gained possession oi the bal\.
and moved to the [Sryard line of
Lake Forest where, with around 2
minutes remaining, the Flaming
Reds blocked an attempted field
goal. Thus time elapsed with the
Flaming Reds basting the Pioneers
14712, in their first game against
each other as Midwest Conference
rivals.

Both Mark Bowman and Tom
Goetz had good days rushing,
finishing with 92 and 84 yards
respectively,

The defense, which held Lake
Forest to just 104 net yards
rushing, seems to be operating
much more effectively as a unit. in
spite of the loss, there was a great
deal of noticeable improvement
which should promote both con-
fidence and optimism for future
games.
