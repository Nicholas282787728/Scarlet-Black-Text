DUAL MEET.

S, U. l. in the Lead.

The Dual Meet was pulled off
this afternoon; as usual, under this
favorable weather conditions. Ale
though it did not rain,a miniature
cyclone which swept up the track,
blew over huldles and sent clouds
of dust into the faces ofonloolters
and contestants alike, proved sur
f-iciently disagreeable.

The meet was won by 1owa
City beyond a doubt, although wc
are unable to give a iull report as
we go to press. so far as here
given, the score stands 63% to
4m in favor of the old gold, and
although Grinnell may scrape up
some points in the four remaining
events, she cannot possibly equal
this lead. The meet was fairly
conducted and sportsrnanlilte on
both sides.

Tennis Tournament.

The lennls tournament at 05kg.
loosa yesterday added another
item to the long list of defeats
which have been Grinnell's por-
ticn this week. The men who
played for Penn college were all
excellent players, more especially
Ellis who is a leading candidate
forchampionshiphonorsthisyear,
and their steady and consistent
work was too much for the efforts
of the Grinnell representatives,
although most of the games were
close, and the playing was even
closer than the score indicates.
Belden deserves special mention
tor the strong showing he made
in singles against Ellis. The sum~
maiy follows:
