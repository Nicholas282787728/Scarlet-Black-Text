Homecoming Presentation of‘OLlr Town’ Seen as Brilliant
Performance of Novel, Provocative, and Timely Play

 

By Henry Alden.

Among the various attractions
of Homecoming not the least ind»
poi-tant was the pcrformancc of
Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize
play, “oin- Town,” presented
last Friday and Saturday by the
Grinnell Chapter of Pi Epsilon
Delta under the direction of Sara
Sherman Pryozn In many ways it
was one of the most satisfying
performances that Grinncll has
secn.

No doubt the novelty of thc
technical presentationithc skit
ful use of lights and the absence
of all but the most rudimentary
stage props—was the chief at-
traction, but this interest was
supported by the generally fine
acting. The chief role was that
of the stage manager, played by

 

Homel- McDowell. If he seemed

occasionally less informal and
his voicc more in the grand man
ncr than the part called for, at
least he spoke his lines beautiful
ly and he kept a long part from
ever ebucomlng' monotonous, Betty
Lcy was particularly moving in
the third act and her skilful_per-
formancc made clear the naturab
ly confusing scene of her return
to her twelfth birthday. Francis
Wigdalil was appealingly young
as Georgc; although he occasionr
ally “Sqllirmec‘l” even more than
thc typical bashful adolescent, he
played the last scene with cDm~
mendablc restraint.

Helen Bayuk deserves particu—
lar praise because she alone main
tained always the illusion of be-
ing a child without ever seem-
ing to be an adult playing the
role of a child. The cast was a

long one, and it may prove in-
vidious to mention names. One
must recognize. hoii ver, the new
evidence of vcrsati ty in Mary
Helen Whetstonc's performance
of the role of Mrs. Gibbs, thc tier
lightful comedy of James Rus-
sell‘s impersonation of the pro-
fessor, the pathos of Ruth
Sclllllte’s Soliloqlly at the wed»
ding, the restrained cmotion of
Joc wall as Dr. Gibbs, and the
absolute naturalness of Duane
Ariiolds newspaper editor, Spe-
cial credit is due, too, to the tech-
nical direction of Alfred Boylen
and his ability to play the drtmk
for sympathy, not laughter.

In fact, the general excellence
of the performance might lead a
spectator who has not also read
