got very conservative alter they got out
tlaughl. So i just think that In some
periods it Wlli move one way and in
some periods it will move another way
But the most intelligent and best train-
gd people in vour society have to be ac-
tive in the decision making it you're go-
ing to have good decisions.

Q What keeps you going?

A': A bellet that progress only comes
through controversy. That alter the
cross there’s il resurrection. And while
Martin Luther King was shot and gave
his life for this movement, I think that if
you look at 1968, the year in which he
was shot, you'll see that that was the
year that black college enrollment ex—
ploded across the country. You'll see
also that that was the beginning at the
black political upsurge You see, so
many things happened in the wake of
his death he almost became more
powerful in death than in life.

;'1 don't think oi the controversy that I
had as in any sense being a setback. I
think it launched me into a hen arena oi
debate I mean the controversnes I had
g'ver South Alrlca being an illegal
government, an illegitimate govern
ment; the Cubans being a Iorce ior
Stability in AIi‘ica - all of these things
yiere controversial here but they
established my credibility in Africa. It
was true and everybody knew it there;
people here didn't viant to admit it We
were able to take that credibility and
affect a good foreign policy in Alrica.

' Non, when I started making moves
that were controversml in the Middle
East, I kneu it would be more difficult;
I was fully prepared to resign over it.
But I insist that l was right, 1 mean
before I met with the Palestinian
Liberation Organization. I had met with
Moyshe Dyan and Schmone Perez,
neither of whom agreed with Begin, and
yet what I became Victim of was
American policy not supporting israel
but supporting Begin. Now we're going
to‘ have an election in lsrael and they're
probably going to put the Begin party
out and put the Labor Early in. We're
going to see changes in the Israeli
policy which will be in the direction oi
things that I was trying to do two years
Ago. I never advocated . , I mean I
Wasn't fighting for a Palestinian state. I
just Said you have to talk to the Palestir
mans. You can't have the major power
In a dispute, the people who have much
more power in the Middle East than
anybody realizes, blocked out.

Martin Luther King used to say that
Violence is the language 0| the unheard.
The viay to put an end to terrorism is to
give people a hearing and I think that‘s
going to happen.

you through your troubles?

A: Oh yeah, because mosi everything
that has happened to me has happened
to him belore and I was with him and I
watched it and I Saw what good It did. I
remember when we talked about nurr
malizmg relations with china, he \ius
attacked as a communist. But all he
said was that 800 million people viill not
cease to exist Simply because we reluse
to remenwe thal they‘re there. Oh,

the country to another as that no ituiiltl
dart make a stutemeni like that. Vie-ll ii

shocked to think that people would
think that that nas so controiersiai
