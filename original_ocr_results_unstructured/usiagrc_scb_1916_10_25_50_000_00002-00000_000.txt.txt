We think we have just discovered an
interesting ieatnre ot the lowe nhsent
Vuter's law. On inquiry we ﬁnd that a
man can vote hetore he register-s.
Heretotore this has never hecn DOSA

see no reason why it can not he done.

Under the statute which permits the
vote at men while away from home,
no provision was made for registration
from a distance, That should he done
in person. A new set oi registration
bank: must he made up this year, so
every voter is required to register
again whether- he has done so hereto-
fore or not. The Registers will sit
October 2n, 7 and 2s, and again on
November 4.

However, the absent voter's low re«
quires that an application for a hello:
should he sent to the County Auditor
or the county in which the voting is
to he done and not more than ten and
not less than three days previous to
the election. This otticial thcn main.
is harlot nhich is returned in time in
he counted. There is nothing in the
law that we have heen aide to rind
which would prevent a man troin vote
ingr say ahout the second 0: Novena-
her, and than registering on the tonrtlr.
The County Auditor, however. may
choose to withhold the hniiot until oi—

nrent. -
