ted me more than ever. I have taken
the ultimate columnist cop-out and
will present What i have so aptly
named, a guest column. The fol»

for what you are about to read

Humble Fie’s new album Smokin’
is the follow-up to their live album
at the Fillmore and comes closer
to defining what. they are about
than their previous albums have
This album is a rocker, The group
has changed from its jazz style
due to the replacement of guitarist
Peter Framston by Clem Clemson.
The group has found itself by play-
ing rock and leaving jazz to those
who can do it best.

Side one opens with ”Hot n' Nas-
ty" which instantly establishes the
group’s sound. it’s a sound similar
to Cream in that it is slow with a
heavy beat, allowing guitar riffs to
weave in and out of this regular
beat. They are loud, but not in the
noisy anti-music of Grand Funk
and Black Sabbath. They are more
like the Faces, which may be bEr
cause Di Steve Marriott, the lead
singer, was the leader of the Small
Faces before Stewart came along.
The rock and roll sound is always
in the music.

“The Fixer" comes next and it is
more 011the-Same sound. “You’re
So‘ Good to Me” follows, and this
song is more mellow and is very
well done despite the fact that on
previous albums, the "non-rock-
ers" have been the weak points.

“C’Mon Everybody" is an old Ed-
die Cochran (yeah!) song and al-
though the Pie interpret it into their
own style, it still retains all the
features Of the rock classic that it
is “Old Time Feelin' " winds up
side one and has some pretty good
slide guitar work. There's been
better on the Stones and other al-

Smngemd

buins, but the work on this song is
still well done.

“30 Days in the Hole" opens side
two It’s «(are you ready for this?)
"a prison-rocker! That ought to
describe it as well as anything else
Next is the Holland-Dozier-Holland
classic “RoadrRunner” This is
the weakest song on the album since
the Pie slows it down more than it
should be However, it is still worth
listening to The weakest, as usual,
is followed by the strongest; it's
called “I Wonder", a slow blues
number which emphasizes Marri-
ott's voice and harp playing. His
voice has the same “gravelly” qual»
ity as Stewart’s, only Marriott’s is
higher.

The album closes with ”Sweet
Peace and Time” which is another
rocker and though it’s not as out
standing as the two on the first side,
it is still worth listening to.

Some have criticized this album to

bc repetitious, with similar versus
und rilis But isn't this what rockis
all about7 It’s the kind of music
that's easy to danceto. (Something
we could sure use at a Grinliell
concertr—R M ) if you want decent
rock and roll, take a look and listen
to Smokin' by Humble Pie.

NTl’s 'Periormers’:
Contagious Energy

by Laura Korach
On Monday night, April 17, the
Bus Company of the National Thea-
tre Institute opened their tour show
here with a piece entitled, “Per—
formers". It was not what one
could call a standard play, but rather
a series of sketches depicting the
agonies and the ectasies of a life in
the theatre.

Each member of the company con.
tributed his or her ideas along this
line of thought and gradually scenes.
songs, and interchanges developed,
Ideas were thrown out during he re
hearsal periods and slowly they were
molded into the show which we saw
here. There was much soulrsearch-
ing and long hours of concentrated
effort on the part of the company
members. The members worked, on

,the average,,ten hours a day tor

three weeks creating “Performers”
and they are not finished yet by any
means.

The piece is entitled, not only
“Performers”, but "Performers;
a work in progress” and this is
exactly what it means, Every stop
they make along their 6,000 mile
tour will be spent rehearsing»
changing things, revising, and add»
ing new dimensions to their show.

The show was charged with energy
and the atmosphere on stage was
quite contagious. Parts of it were
very personal and weren't under-
stood by many audience members

'Redeeming Value’

by Robert Simmons

In contrast to the irivolity of last
week’s films, the Jewish Cultural
program has brought in two films of
redeeming social value. Lel My Peo-
ple Go comes highly recommended
as a thoughtful and moving documen-
tary depicting the genocide of Euro-
pean Jewry and their uphill battle

for rebirth m the Land of Israel. A
story about the fight to survive in

the face of the people who brought
you Dachau, Auswitz, and the luv-
able little Volkswagen. don’t miss
it.

The story of The Fixer deals with
the persecution of Jews in Czarist
Russia. A peasant (Alan Bates) is
able to hide his identity and escape
the horror and restriction of the
Ghetto to pass as a Gentile. He is
framed for the killing of a young
boy, imprisoned and tortured. It is
based on fact. The film's director,
John Frankenheimer, has spent most
at his career examining the reac»
tions of men under stress. In this
film, Bates’ attempts to resist his
oppressors in order to maintain his
principles are contrasted with Simi~
lar battles of conscience among his
official tormentors.

The production is quite lavish, have
ing been made entirely on location
in Yugoslavia. The performances,
particularly by Bates, Dirk Bogarde,

and various members of the Royal
Shakespeare Company, are out
standing. As a whole, however, the
film is too long and rather mis-
guided in its point of view. ltatms
very high in trying to do many things
on different levels, when unfortun-
ately only some of them succeed.

Most people react to Clint Eastr
wood as a horse opera hack, but he
has a real talent for playing the kind
of character that is Dirty Harry. Don
Siegel, the director, is little known
here, yet in France lie is a cult
figure or great stature for his work
on just this kind of movie (eg,
Madigan, Coogan’s Bluff). -Dirty
Harry is the old psychorkiller loose
in the city story, but there arca few
new ideas that give strength to the
characters and make the movie a
real treat.

The clicherrealism of San Fran-
cisco rooftop locations is a minor
flaw in a movie genre that too often
tends to be a complete cliche This
is a rather bare, straight to the
point production without an excess
or showy theatrics Every now and
then Siege] sneaks in a fabulous
piece of technique that you really
have to watch for to notice, All I
may say is watch for it; a great
choice for this week's Strand
special.

but this didn’t seem to matter as
the Grlnliell audience was quite
enthusiastic in their acceptance of
the Bus Company Their set was
very effective consisting of many
levels and ins and outs it] work with.
it looked like a makeshitt garage
type stageﬁproducing a dreamrlike
effect as the actors moved about it
in their white—lace makeup. The cos»
tumes were nothing startling but
were probably replicas of the cloth-
ing worn by the actors during re—
hearsal. They contributed a com-
fortable and natural atmosphere to
work in.

”Performers” was a tight, action-
packed show and I must admit, it
was one of the best theatre pieces
I have seen here atGrinnell. Every—
one worked together as a unit and
the show flowed through and was tied
to each actors' emotions It was a
true pleasure to watch and to par-
ticipate in.

The Doppelt Effect

Come On All You
Big Strong Men

by Jack Doppelt

During last Week's antlrwai' activlr
ties, one sad commentary on
Grlniiell life was apparent That was
and is the relation between the town
and we ivory tower students

in the allrcampus meetings, it was
decided that we should not attempt
to shove our beliefs and alternatives
for action upon the townspeople We
had alienated townspeople so cone
clusively two years ago that hitter
feelings still hadn't dissipated

I don’t dispute this beliet held by
Michele Conway and others; fmer
ly find the situation itself distres-
sing, After all, Grinnell is a more
liberal than average town and the
dichotomy between the town and us
simply reflects the isloation and
futility that Students and any move-
ment that they defend must cope with,

it is quite unfortunate that we must
treat the townspeople wlth “kid
gloves" when we treat our own apn-
Ihetic or disagreeing students with
a sledge hammer. We hammered the
college with a referendum, suggeSr
tions that classtime be devoted to
antirwar discussions, a saga fast
and mailbox stufflings and we fondled
the town with a story in the Herald-
Register and a few of their high
school children.

it was emphasized at the meetings
that townspeople would be intinll»
dated by college proselytists even
if they agreed that the escalation of
the war Should be condemned. Some-
how it was implicit that We would be
verbally accosting the townspeople,
not harmoniously interacting with
them

i hope the townspeople don’t sucr
cumb to that sort of attitude, I
wouldn't relish going to a City Counr
on meeting and being told that the
townspeople wouldn’t address the
college community because they
would be poorly received.

The favorable reaction of towns
people to the Friday morning march
through town, as expressed by a

Two years ago, when the Balfn

was conVlnced that never again would
I see an audience show so much
enthusiasm and genuine affection for
a group of performers i was wrong.
The Cajun music men outdid them-
selves last Saturday night. The film
fectious rhythm caused such symp
toms as severe meetapping, hand-
clapping and acute ear-to-ear
smiles. Many could not resist the
temptation to get up and dance It
was a happy, good-time music, cx-

pertly played by honest iolks it was
like coming home to old triends.
Balfa seemed deeply touched {it the
warm reception, commending the
Grinnell audience for being one of
their best He expressed a desire to
come back next year, and this old
senior sincerely hopes that you all
don't forget to invite themuperhaps
for a dance, instead of a concert

The Fifth Column

Dole Finds Role Af Drake

by Clayton Lee, Phil salkind,
and Mike Hanson

Robert “the crazy pineapple” Dole.
pig irom Kansas, reputed lackey of
the Mad Bomber, escaped Friday
from the clutches of a Vigilante ac»
tion, organized by a notorious youth
gang known as the Young Republi—
cans, who create the need for the
likes of Abbie lloffmzin. Dole, se-
verely wounded by a trap of logic
and truth set by his “audience",
slunk out to a getaway car and took
the last flight out of town.

The resident media magicians of
WHO Lind KRNT covered up his
tracks by casting a spell over the
Tv to make only nice things appear
on the news. Friday’s attempt at
criminal obfuscation was a typical
stunt of the pack of rogue elephants
(and don't forget the jackasses) who
have been turning their insidious
tricks lately.

Though it is no recompense for
genocide, this law cniorcement oi-
ficial found satisfaction in seeing a

nervous desperado, as desperate as
his caps in Washington, who, pushed
to the wall by imminent defeat,
boldly and courageously charges on
to a new plateau at barbarism, be
so upset at a successful challenge
that he would smile at his antagonists
and try to shake their hands, telling
them to “keep it up.”

It iS difficult to assess the signifir
cance of last week’s action, though
it was fun chasing a wild bear to
the Des Moines airport, it was a
reaction felt directly by the Adminr
lstration. Organized by the Draft
and Peace Center in Des Moines, it
represented a broad Cl‘OSSrSeCthn
of the community opposed to ad»
ministration policies ., veterans,
WIND wellare, mothers, labor, stur
dents, and professionals The media
emphasized the student i-ole, though
the majority in the auditorium were
not students

The spcech was not disrupted; a
veteran just demanded that Dole
confine his remarks to the present
situation ili Indochina and submit
to questioning, Dole ignorcd him,

» problem

story in the Des Moines Register,
I hope will manifest into the per-
sonal cooperation and understanding
that the faculty and students Often
demonstrate on such issues. The
same cohesiveness that resulted in
a trip to Washington in 1970 by zi
administi'ation-facultyrstudcnt con-
tingeut to protest the invasion of
Cambodia and killings at Kent State
could spread to the town.

In most matters, townrgown rela-
tions are sound. However, in a
crisis situation, we feel that the
town tightens up and retreats into
115 cocoon, From a townsperson’s
viewpoint, the irony oi that pheno—
menon must be obvtous.

Of the interminable tribulations,
the townspeople must fight as a
family, as a town and as animpo-
tent unit within the United States,
the college Consistently hides with—
in its own institutional, nonretfected
shell

Although town—gown cooperation is
steadily improving, the perceptions
by both the townspeople and the stu-
dents of the other's willingness to
help when it IS needed has lagged
behind The students, in pursuit of
the spontaneous support of the town,
have been frustrated by their tna~
bllity to mobilize the town as they
can the campus Similarly, the sine
dents have disappointed the town in
lls struggle against drugs in the
high school and in its attempt to
help those a little less fortunate
than healthy, intelligent, wealthy
college students

The disappointing facet oi the whole
is that both sides are
making a concerted effort to help.
College students are acting as big
brothers and sisters to kids from
town and the town has been exceedr
ingly cooperative when wegive them
a couple ol days notice for an antir
War demonstration.

We have to realize that it is just
as difficult for the town to get stu-
dents out of their isolation without
begging as it is for the students to
get townspeoplc up for an antirwar
demonstration, Sure, the Vietnam
War should affect the town as much
as it affects us, but presence of
underprivileged kids in Grinnell
should affect its as it does the town.

Until we stop perceiving towns-
people as “townles” whose lunction
is to sell us whatever we need to
exist in our (forms, we can hardly
expect a unilicd townrgown atitirwar
effort.

If we ever get to the poiiit where
we don't look down upon the Grilinell
Herald-Register, the City Council
and the farmers ii ho shop here as we
do. We won't have to worry about
antagonizing the town

whereupon the audience stood with

Was the name of a Casualty,

Dole, shaken, continued on his
planned speech but due to the per,
sistence oi the veterans finally ac-
quiesced to questioning The precise
questioning produced vague dodges
from Dole, who put out a standard
Republican line blaming the Demo-
crnts for the War,

Assuming dissatisfaction, the or-
ghnizers had arranged for some
theater which materialized in the
form of a black coffin escorted to the
podium, accompanied by Taps He
finally split, tuned to the point of
cancelling a reception with the YAF

We can conclude, and hope that the
administration does likewise, that
