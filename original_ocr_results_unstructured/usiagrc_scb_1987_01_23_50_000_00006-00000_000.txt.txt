Choice

In this week’s Campus Memo, the Stu-
dent Affairs Office and Car Pool on.
noanced that their offices were going to
offer a student shuttle to and from Des
Moines with a scheduled atop at the
Merle Hay Shopping MalL 'Perhaps to
most Grinnell students, the administra-
tion shuttle was a positive step toward
improving the non-academic lines of
Grinnell students. Yet to those Grinnell
women who have spent years on this
campus without any administration-
supported transportation to a women’s
health clinic, the Administration‘s ac-
tion is on outrageous example of how
this college continues to neglect the
needs of crinnelt women. .

According to women in the campus
Women's Group, the fight for transpor—
tation to o women‘x health care facility
hm lasted almost 15 years and as of to-
doy, Grinnell women still must prooide
their ,own transportation to a‘women’:
health clinic in Marshalltown. Yet, as of
today, all Grinnell students will be pro.
vided weekly transportation to a shopp-
ing molt. This policy is simply
ridiculous for o college thot is sup-
posedly concerned with the

. academic as well as the academic lives
of students.

Like most college students, Grinnell
students are often subjected to the irra.
tional actions of college administrators
who are either ignorant of or on
concerned with the, needs ofthe student
body. But with this latest Des Moines
mall shuttle, the administration has
proven itself to be blatantly negligent
in needs of Grittne" women,

Big White ﬂakes flurried from the south
this morning. The sky was grey, and the
air. like a Sound slap. chilled my cheeks to
numbness. fl‘en years ago my sister’s open
palm did the same, only the [lakes were
larger when I ripped the arms of her teddy
bear irom their sockets. They pack a lot of

stuliing into those bloated bellies.

Back then I was a nasty kid who picked
his nose when he mough nobody was look-
ing and fed Mth to the yappy little punr
table dogs in the backyard until they would
throw-up mulLi-colored patches in the
snow.

They were hyperactive dogs, and olten
their little doggy tempers would become
unleashed. Fur would fly and they would
chomp into each other. When the blood
began to ﬂow and their throats became
mangled and stained, Dad would step into
the tray with a rolledup newspaper and a
loud vocabulary to til the mood. I can't
remember for certain, but I think they
were toy poodles. _

So. alter l dismembered my sister’s
bear 1 was paddled to pinkness and sent to
choke on my tears and undeserved
humiliation in my room. '

I don‘t knclw if she ever got a stuffed
animal to replace the one I executed.
Anyway, she can get all oi the bears she
could ever want now, because she's 21 and
preparing to get married in mid-February

A lot of older people live in my
neighborhood. Dad, though he’s getting up
there in age himseli, straps on his bright
red, lullrbody snowsuit every time the
Sidewalks become covered and trumps up
and down the street in heavy boots clear»
mg off neighbors’ drives. Mom says that
with his pot. belly he looks like Sarita. I Say,
“Yeah. driving a ﬂesh-eating beastsleigh
pulled by 12 nut~soVilny reindeer,”

Some of the neighbors have thanked him
by sending baked goods over to the house. I
guess he gets a real charge out of helping
out. He denies it, but that blower is his
pride and joy. his snownme toy.

Suzie, a good friend of mine who lives in

Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle, loves
Chinese food, which is almost. non—existent
in Iowa. Over break she went out for sweet
and sour pork, fried rice (“Dyed lice” as
the owner puts it), and chicken cth mein.
