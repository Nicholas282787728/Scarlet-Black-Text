Rethink subStance-free' residence halls

it was no surprise to us when only eight Grinnell students
drew into James Hall, the newest and most controversial addi»
tion to substancerfree housing on campus. We were even less
sutfprised to leam that ofthe eight students, not all of them
std identify as substancefree. With only eight upperclassmen
living in a residence hall that houses 60 students, the adminir
tration has effectively created a first-year dormi

This is disconcerting on a number of levels. Not only will
these ﬁrst~years be responsible for navigating the drug and al-
eohol culture of south campus alone, but in their isolation they
will not be privy to the multi~class camaraderie of most ﬂoors.

On a broader scale, tlié “housing crisis” extends beyond the
situation in James Student Affairs was forced to make 32 subs
stnncc-neutral rooms previously designated for incoming ﬁrsts
ycars available during regular room draw Sincc substancctrcc
rooms in James were not among those reallocated, the natural
dissemination of upperclassmeu throughout rcsidcncs halls
was signiﬁcantly impeded as substance neutral second, third,
and fourth year students were less likely to draw into the south
campus dorm. ~ ,

Despite the efforts of administrators to solicit widespread
student input,,their efforts ultimately fell shorti While we be:
lieve those in Student AﬂEdirs made a sincere attempt to give all

students, regardless of their position on substance use, a place
to live on North, East, as well as South

Campus, student interest in a Southide ,

sub-free dorm was obviously not enough

to warrant James’ new sub-free distinc-

tion.This response was expected given the

dam gathered in an informal onlinc poll in

which the student body overwhelmingly ,

ested Norris as the new substance—free location.

c urge the administration to take immediate steps to te—
avalirats substance-free housing on Grinnell College campus by
taking steps to resolve this unfortunate situation. While James
clearly isn’t the optimal residence hall to house substance-free
students, perhaps other halls would adequately fill the purport-
ed need for additional subrfrce housing.

Titular Head 2009 was a great success

We were not impressed last year when Conor Mcgcc ’08
downed an entireﬂask, took off his pants and made out with
two different girls onstage while emceeing Tit Head, and we
were far from delighted when he spent the entire night harass
mg thc audience and failing to introduce even one video'ihis
only real job. In addition to the drunken emcee, few movies
were particularly noteworthy, and the campus seemed to forget

about the event within ‘ust a few days
eedless to say, those of us who mtpe-
rienced the misfortune of last yeal’s Tit
Head wart. pleasantly surprised by this year‘s
show Emcee Rachel Fields ’09 not only suc-
cessfully introduced each video, but did so
without antagonizing the entire room. Even
, though she was barely audible beneath rhe
bellows of drunken viewers, her’charm and humor managed
to get her jumped by multiple horny audience members. All
without removing any articles oi clothing!

The event itself was well coordinated by Mark Sullivan ’10
and Dan Nccly '09. Each film was preceded by a transitional
clip, which helped retina rhc evening. That sense of rcilncntcnt
ms mirrored in the movies themselves, many of which utilized
high quality eFfects and cinematic techniques not frequently
scan in Tit Head ﬁlms of the past. Still, Tit Head managed to
retain an air of gmnginess that seems to be its staple.

A combination of factors~a coherent and engaging em-
cee, entertaining ﬁlms, and two, count them, two, phalli—made
this years Tit Head an overwhelming success. We enjoyed it
so much that we got three tickets of our own to make a lame
movic, and as long as T—Pain doesn't show up, we're bringiri
you. Don’t torgct your nippy ﬂoppies.

Response to Gibel Mevorach’s letter

In our letter to the Sod}, Noah Tercnbaum and I expressed
out disagreement with Maurice Rournani's uneasidcd talk on
the isracli-Palesrinlan conﬂict and called for more produc-
tivc cngmgcmcnr in support of our vicw that “thc Israelirl’alr
estinian conﬂict merits rational, fair, and sufﬁcient discussion
on our campus." It is ironic then that Rebecca Heller, Katya
Gibel Mcvorach, nnd Routnani himself (in an online com-
ment) would see fit to accuse us of refusing to engage with
those whose perspectives differ from our own] suspect that
in their haste to hurl unfounded criticisms at us, the failed to
properly consider our oincThc point ofour initial ctter (and

speak only for myse )was the distinction between productive
engagement and obstacles to productive engagement.
lconvrote that initial letter as a student who finds, like most
do, that debate on the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict suffers from a
lack offacts and a preponderance ofemotionrladen accusations
that makcs the issue too hostile for most of us to publicly dis-
cuss. I take issue with Roumani not because ofthe side he so 7
parts, but btcausc oflus refusal to cngagc in discussion on ra'lr
terms. Someone who advances a perspective in good faith, sins
cerely believm that her position is the more ersuasivc/correct
one, should welcome the input of those who isa ree.Roumani
chose Instead to simply assert his perspective an to intimidatc
and ignore those with other, valid perspectives. He spent 20
minutes prefacing his talk with rambles about his childhood
and studies, rambles meant to tell the listener, “i grew u in
Libya! I am a Jew! I spent years studying the Middlc East! am
a scholar! You are in no position to second—guess me!"The rest
of his talk was spent constmeripjg a fairly simple, ofrrrepeated
story of a nation born against odds, a nation of op ressed
proplcs who want only to live in peace but unfortunate y have
ad to continue ﬁghting Arab states and terrorists (those sore
losers) until the present day. Roumani did not present an argue
mcnt; he simply said, this is how things stood then, and this is
how things stand now. He refused to answer questions osed
to him, but instead chose to express indignation that he s ould
be challen ed (l),At one oint, against his own earlier claim to
understand and rcspccr slam (I supposc nobody was fooled),
he blamed the entire conﬂict on Islam’s inability to accept the
OEhll’r I should think if one were to make such claims, they
had better ive good arguments for them. He did not. I found
his talk dis ones: and insultin to our intelligence. And hercl

did not shrewdly insinuate the spurious debate over whether
Zionism [rir] is antinSemitism and lnsrdlously citc Jewish phi-
losopher, Hannah Arendt, as a shield en route to the crescendo
of an incendiary statementr" While on the point of sill com-
ments, Roumani’s perspective is not valid just because it has not
been hcard in 14 years. Ifwe are committed to such diversity of
opinion, perhaps the College should invite Larry Summers to
give a lecture on the subject ofwomen in the sciences?

The conﬂict strikes me as particularly worth of our time
because of its effects on international normative iscoursc.Tli<:
shccr bigotry that surrounds this one issue makes it so easy
for some to completely rubbish the notion ofuniversal human
rightsi Others use it [0 fan anti-Western, anti-Semitic senti-
ments that do nothing to help achieve crosSrcultural under
standing and rmnsccn conﬂict, And some just losc hope that
change can happen, that peace can be achieved, that 'ustice and
solidarity have any cache in modern politics. Pro uctive en-
gagement is our only hope, and so we must insist upon it.

We need a more productive dialogue
I would like to comment on Rebecca Heller’s letter and

Katya Gibcl Mevoracli’s column in last week's SFXB about the
symposium “Trimscendlng Conﬂict: lsrncl and Palestine."Hellr
er is correct in recognizing the symposrum as a collaboration
between Chalutzrtn and the Palestinian Solidarity Group, and
that PSG reviewed the résumé ofMaurice Roumanl, a member
of the Israel on Campus Coalition, )rior to his invitation to
speak. The disagreement between us lies in our interpretations
Dfeacll grou ’s role, rsvcnlad by our rcccnr letters. In my opin,
ion, clearl . tlrricrcnt than Rebecca's, Chalutaim largely holds
res otlsibility for Roumnni’ nvitation, PSG for the visit of the
PalistmianrAmerican medical student Harb Harb.Thls COUC’
s ends to our grou s' rcsenmrions of candidates for speakers.
gallaborations of this kind, especially first attempts, are bound
to contain mistakes in their organization and execution. De—
spite the sym osium’s successes, I View as a mistake the failure
of myselfnn my arrners to identify and address the discom
nect in understanding ofthe roles of Chalutzim and PSG.

Gibel Mevorach, in her column, portrays my cri cism of
Roumani's placc in the symposium as “silly, . based on the fact
that PSG has sponsored equally polemical speakers in the past,
She fails to note, however, that never before have Chalutzirn
and P56 collaborated with the expressed goal of fostering diar
logue, We do not den that many mcmbcrs ofour community
have considered past SG-sponsored speakers polemical. Yet,
PSG did not sponsor such speakers with rhc central goal of
dialogue romot‘ Rather, we intended their talks to inform
others o our opi ons and present arguments for them. Roun
mani was an inappropriate choice to speak because he actively
worked against our symposium’s goal offostcring dialogue.

Furthermore, Gibel Mevorach’s sug estion that students
with “little to no knowledge about the iddle East and North
Africa" have no business discussing the Israeli-Palestinian cons
flict stifles dialogue itself. Besides the inaccuracy ofhcr assesSr
ment of students'i norance, I propose that even students with
little knowledge 0 the area’s history can discuss many aspccrs
of thc conﬂict, like current events we witness daily in the news,

Finally, these letters prove that, despite Roumani's visit, the
central goal of the symposium, to foster dialogue about [smelt
Palestine on our campus, has succeeded. More than three weeks
afrcr the symposiums events, snrdcnts and faculty continuc to
talk about the conflict and strategies for constructively discuss»
ing it.That in itself, no matter ons's political stance, should be
regarded as a succcss.
