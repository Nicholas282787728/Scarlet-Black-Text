the floodgates for politymnkers to restore order at the expense of
their rights. Let‘s choose security alldlibcrry while we still can.

But when lt comes ro [l‘lc USA PATRIOT l‘tcr, more is too much
posslbiliry for rights lnfringcnrcnr and too few beneﬁts.

The rcr gives rbc guvcrnmcnr broad rurlrorlry to viblrrc citi-
zens’ civil lrbcrries In Why: mm were previously prohibited; ac
cording to rhc ACLU, the version of the Patriot Act currently
under consideration will only widen the loopholes tbrr enable the
administration to spy on citizens.

For example, section 215 bars doctors, accountants, librarr
lllns and others holding private records from notifying clients
that their records were subpoenaed until a yenr after the fact, and
the gag crdcr can be extended lndeﬁnltely by r “nrrionrl security
certiﬁcation” from the administration.

And this isn't just for tcrrorisrs, either: Section 215 doesn’t
require the government to show a link between the documents
they suck and a terrorist or spy,

Citizens who are
under investigation
therefore have no rigbr
to develop a defense or
challenge subpoenns.
And rhat’s just one ex
ample.

But whether or not
suspected terrorists
should be afforded Ice
gal rights while they are
under investigation, the

dangerous myth that the USA PATRIOT Act only applies to
suspected terrorist activity is false.

For instance, People for the American Way report that they
have found evidence that the FBI has used irs newfound author-
iry in a Medicare fraud case that had nothing to do with terror-
ism.

Of course, the deﬁnition of terrorism itself is in question:
the USA PATRIOT Act broadens the scope of the term cone
sldcrably, Section 802 deﬁnes the crime of“domestlc terrorism,"
which now includes any actions within the United States that are
“dangerous to humrln life" and intend “to intimidate or coerce a
civilian pcpulnrion"cr “to inﬂucnct: the policy ofa government by
intimidation or coercion" (there are additional characteristics of
domestic terrorism Listed, but the two preceding characteristics
or: sufﬁcient on their own).

Wberber or not protests should be “dangerous to human life,"
the USA PATRIOT Act seems to allow ofﬁcials to identify any
act ofciv‘ll disobedience rhat escalates (unexpectedly, even) as ter-
rorism. The immediate result may be the chilling of dissent; rhe
lcng-rcrm results could bc far worsc,

The question still exists: is giving up such a wide range of civil
liberties to the government worth it? The truth is that many of
the powers granted to the government by the acrwerc already on
the books in slightly more rights-conscious forms bcfcrcwc were
attacked (rake FISA, for example).

Obviously, in the days following the Sept. 11 attacks, we
heard plenty of impassioned arguments flom our politicians in
fllvor oftllc USA PATRIOT Act Provisions—(tr least from those
who weren't opcrrring secretly under rbe cover or nighr or from
bunkers in undisclosed lOClIf‘lOnSibllt our democracy is resilient
enough to recover from me perilous, nndemecmnc politics of
fear.

Our leaders should recognize and correct their crror cxpedr-
:ntly and we plan to do what we can to make that happen.
