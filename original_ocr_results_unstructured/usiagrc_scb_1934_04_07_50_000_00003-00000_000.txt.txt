Smith Thursday night, and Clark’s
triumph over Langan, The title will
go to the winner of an elimination

defensive strength, the Smith-Dibble
game threatened to end in a tie until
Nygaard contributed a free throw
with only 19 seconds to play to give
the northenders a 776 margin. Voss
scored a field goal, and Nygaard an-
other free
while Smith was held to a field goal
by Robb and a free throw by Kerr
as the southenders missed their
chance at an undisputed claim to the
title.

‘c'lEr’k elevated itself to the leading
quartet by downing the last place

test, and Baer counted eight times
from the free throw line. Duncan adds
ed a field goal for Clark. Horton
scored a field goal and Henningsen a
charity toss for Langan.

Gates hall’s protest of its game
with Rawson was overruled by the
intramural board, Which decided that
the game should stand with the score
at the time the Gates team left the
pool, 14 to 12. As a result of this de-

toss 'earlier for Dibble,_
