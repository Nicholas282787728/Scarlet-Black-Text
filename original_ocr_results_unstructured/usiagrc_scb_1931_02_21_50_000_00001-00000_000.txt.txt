Altered Castes Check Action
of ‘Polly With Past’;

Direction Good

By HELEN KINGERY

0f such a play we asked only to
be amused~and we were amused.
“Polly With A Fast,” presented
Thursday evening in the auditorium
of the Alumni Recitation hall by the
experimental theater staff, was an»
nounced as an experiment in produc»
tion, aiming to give actual experience
to as many people as possible.
Only as the result of such a project
could be justiﬁed the marked set-
backs to the line of action which
came through the changing of castes
in each act.

In spite of this, the three different
“directions" were uniﬁed, primarily
by the continuity of the two leading
roles taken by Lavinnia‘Lillroth and
James Clarke.

Convincing in Original Character

Miss Llllroth’s character as Polly,
promising little more than an adorn—
ment in the ﬁrst of the play, gave
increasingly as the action ascended
In the same measure that she aban»
doned herself to her partrwithinra
part, she became more convincing in
her original character.

Her gracing quality was not so
much in a handling of the lines, or

even in a well-managed
stage technique, but
rather in a certain elec-
tric charm which gave
the rest of the charac-
ters and business of the
moment vibrancy as
they were subjected to
it.
Perhaps their highest
response came with the
Clarke end of the first act.
which suddenly lifted the plot-struc-
ture to a spontaneous conception
motivated by the characters them-
selves.
Mr. Clarke Cleverly Naive

Mr. Clarke's action was as con-
sistent as it was cleverly naive. His
irresponsible comedy was carried
gracefully into the few scenes in
which he was left control of the situa-
tion. The confession of true affection
in the last act was done most happily
in not being overdone.

other parts varied with their
changing interpretations. There was
fortunate combination in the co-action
of George Guyan and Irwin Cxley as

Catherine Corr, Ruth Horine, Virr

Mr. Housknecht conducted an ex-
aminers training course in Crinnell
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
The work dealt with the various techr

with the ﬁnal examination Wednes-
day evening.

Eight women and four men took

improving rapidly.

Professor Almy spent two weeks in

Employment Tips

Business or teaching applicants
who wish to secure positions at
some distance from Grinnell are
seriously handicapped because of
the difﬁculty of making applicar
tion in person. A letter of applica~
tion, no matter how well written,
seldom does more than pave the
way for a personal interview.

With workers in all ﬁelds so
plentiful, employers will not take
the chance of hiring anyone “sight
unseen.”

Local Scoring;
Fouls Lacking

Don King, Monahan Make
Only Bulldog Goals

From Floor

By BILL anOIi

(Sports Editor, Scarlet and Black)

DES MOINES—Allowilig only
two Drake university basketball
players. Doll King and Johnny
Mondllan, to score f om the floor
during the game, Gl-illnell college
Varsity cagcrs avenged their 27-12
defeat at Grinllcll on the Bulldog

court here last night, 22 to 15.
Except for one short time. the

Pioneers were in the lead througout
the game. Drake men worked the
ball down to the Grinnell basket
many times. but their short shots al-
ways failed.

"Hank” Duncan led the scoring
for the Pioneers with four baskets,
while Douglas, in addition to some
great defensive work, found the hoop
three times.

Humphrey starts Scoring

Humphrey started the scoring with
a one-handed shot from one side of
the floor. Don King tied the score
with two free throws shortly after—
ward, Two baskets by Duncan and
one by Douglas put the Pioneers in an
3 to 5 lead at half-time.

Near the end of the last period Don
King, who accounted for 11 of the
Blue and Whites 15 points, broke
away from the close guarding that
had characterized the Grinnell de<
tense, and dropped in three baskets.
Monahan was the only other Drake
man to score a field goal during the
contest. That also came in the sec-
ond half.

Drake In Cellar

Both Crinnell and Drake showed
some inability -to hold onto the ball,
and passes frequently went wide of
their mark. McCreary held Don
King to a single basket during the
first half, the counter coming from
far out on the floor. Lynn King, har—
rassed by Duncan and Douglas, had
even less luck, getting a charity
throw during the tangle.

The game was free of fouls, Grin—
nell committing nine, while Drake
was credited with only one.

Drake is now at the bottom of the
Missouri valley conference race. «The
only contests the Bulldogs have won
are over Grinnell and Washington,
while the Pioneers defeated Washing-
ton, the Oklahoma Aggies, and Drake
once each.
