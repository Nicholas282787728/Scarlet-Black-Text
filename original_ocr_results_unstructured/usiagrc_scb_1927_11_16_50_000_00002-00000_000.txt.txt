the college train the late ot the earth. Dr suppose
that some like disaster should suddenly Wreck your home,

notice, so well observed, should have been extended to
sophomores and ,iuniois, is there some new, especial

such tolly in treshnien, but surely the sophomores realize
by now that classes can and do start without their being

desperate measures will hate to be taken, such as: tyingl

the eager undergraduates down, stationing armed guards,

faculty are iull-tledged godlings, and are thereby entitled
to the place or honor. it is against Grinnell tradition
