NO OPEN DAY.

lll place of the lormal open day,
which has ill the past concluded the
)ear’s work ill the women's gymnasi-
llnl, there \rlll be given to the students
and friends of the college this year an
oppoltunity to be present at a peliod
ol regular class \\'0Ik.

On Wednesday and Thursday attere
noons of next week at ﬁve o’clock,
friends will be welcome to the half
hour period of the advanced class.

The object of this plan is to relieve
the members of the class or the over
strain which accompanies the prepara-
tion for a formal open day, and to
still give those who ale interested an
opportunity to witness the work as it
is carried on informally from day to

_ day.
