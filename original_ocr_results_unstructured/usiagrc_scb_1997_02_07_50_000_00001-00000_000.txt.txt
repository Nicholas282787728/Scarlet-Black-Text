Few events slated for Black History Month

Organizational woes tempered by high quality results

 

BYJithuarsoN
News Co-Editor

The calendar of
activities com-
memorating Black
History Month is
sparse this year for
a reason, according to Lisa Alexander
(’97), spokesperson for Concerned Black
Students. In fact, aside from the annual
kick-off party held Feb. 1 this year at
Harris Center, the first week of February
passed without a single speaker or event
related t9 black history. CBS currently is
the only organization charged with plan»
ning events for the month

We purposely didn‘t plan that many
events this year,"Alexander said Tuesday,
“because we were hoping that the admin
istration or other organizations would take
initiative and help with some of the plan-
ning."

It is too much to expect ofmembers of
a single organization to take responsibilr
ity for contacting Speakers, seeking fund-
ing and coordinating events for an entire

month,Alexander explained. CBS has 25
active members at present. Several events,
including a poetry reading at Bob’s Un-
derground, were scheduled initially but
had to be canceled when planning became
overwhelming. With the exception ofhelp
from the English Department, which cor
sponsored one of the speakers, the brunt
of coordlnating Black History Month’s
events fell on the shoulders of CBS mem-
bers.

”It’s a deﬁnite problem," Alexander
said. “Wejust didn’t want to have to do it
all, We’re students, too. I'm trying to
graduate in 103 days,"

Despite the small number ol'events [Cr
maining on the ﬁnal schedule, however,
Alexander pointed out lhatCBS has been
successful in at least two important ways.
The organization received funding from
Grinnell College in order for 30 black stu-
dents to attend a Black Government Con
ference Feb. 2023 in Des Moines. The
conference will consist of it variety of
workshops and entertainment. Prof.
Kesho Scott of Grinnell will lead one of
the workshops, Alexander noted.

in addition, those who attend Black
History Month symposla on campus will
hear from an international perspective,
Profs. Joseph qusani and Adrien Wing
will lecture Feb, 18 in the South Lounge
ofthe Forum about post-Apartheid poli»
tics and race relations in South Africa.
Wing, who lcaches at the University of
Iowa College ofLaw, spoke last spring at
Grinnell about race relations and law. She
is a past Los Angeles district attorney and
has interned at the United Nations Departr
anLOf Political Affairs, Trusteeship and
Decolonization in New York performing
legal and policy analysis with the Counr
oil for Namibia.

A native of South Africa, qusani ate
tended the University of Western Cape
under apartheid laws that required
“coloured" students to register at racially
designated universities. After one year,
qusaui transferred to the University of
Witwatersrand, where he received a de-
gree in political science. He eventually be-
came a lawyer, and currently is a senior
lecturer at the University of Fort Hare.

Amanda Walker is the final

speaker scheduled. She will lead a
symposrum Feb. l9 in South Lounge
about the origins and usage of the
word “nigger.",The annual CBS Tal-
ent Show Feb. 15 and a Young, Gifted
dc Black gospel choir chapel service
Feb. 16 are the only other events.

Alexander said that seeking fund-
ing for the Black Government Confer-
ence and other activities has been the
most challenging part of planning for
Black History Month. She acknowl-
edged that CBS has sought funding
from as many resources as possible to
make the month a success, and said
that she hopes the receipt of funds by
CBS Will not affect money available
for YGB's upcoming spring tour.

Why would the amount of money
given to one organization affect that
given to another?

For some reason, people seem to
think CBS and YGB are connected,"
Alexander said. “They think they've
already given money to CBS, so they
don‘tcontribute to YGB.Idon't know

why that would be."

Donaldson speaks on Native American feminism, fetishism

BY KATE KLEINWORTH

Drawing on her Native American back—
ground. extensive research on the subject,
and popular books such as Women Who
Run With the Wolves, yesterday‘s convo-
cation speaker Laura E. Donaldson spoke
about feminism and New Age Native
Ameticanism in a lecture entitled “Medi-
cine Women and White Shame»ans: New
Age Native Ameticanism, Commodity
Fetishism and the Production of Feminist
Belief." She also held an informal discus
sion in the Forum.

Donaldson, a Cherokee, spoke about
what she called “one of today‘s most
pressing social and moral issues: estab
lishing responsible cross-cultural rela-
tions," To Donaldson. non-native appro-
priation of native traditions represents a
continuation of “500 years of colonialism.
First it was our lands, our resources and
now even our cultures are being taken.”

Many women are drawn to New Age
Native Americanism (NANA), an inter
est in Native AmerECan culture and tradi-
tion, because they believe it helps them
become empowered or whole, yet accord—
ing to Donaldson this adoption of selected
beliefs is useless without a true under-
standing of the culture.

“New Age Native Americanism has
become a powerful catalyst for feminists
to escape the patrianchy of monotheistic
religions, to become empowered,”
Donaldson said. “But few have sought to
learn the right way to respect the ethics
of context, This is just capitalism cloaked
in mystic terms,

“You have to learn in the context of the
whole way of life. I actually think there
is much to be leamed from Native Ameri—
can cultures, but learning from and tak-
ing over are two different things."

in her convocation speech, Donaldson
discussed the oftenyinaccurate portrayal
of native cultures in popular works such
as Lynn Andrews' Medicine Woman and
Clarissa Pinkola Estes’ Women Who Rim
With the Wolves.

”When_I told my friends that l was
writing about Women Who Run With the
Wolves, they were hon‘iﬁed," she said. “l
have friends who‘ve had their lives transr

formed by this book. I'm not against pore
sonal growth. God knows we necd more
mature people. The issue is the way one
does that,"

The authors of these books, Donaldson
explained, base their writing on an amal-
gamation of several dirrcrcni Native
American cultures, without fully under
standing the context of any of them.
NANA also leads to the t’ctishization of
customs and beliefs, cutting them off front
their contextual meaning,

“What is in these books is d pastiche,
a bastardizcd concept of psciido-lndnui
civllization," Donaldson sald “Different
social and cultural realities arc slrlppcd

of their historical speciﬁcity and inter-
preted in logic of
postmodernism. it cuts off objects from
their context and abducts them form their
culture, denudes (hem oftheir identlty. It
recalls the reduction of women to sexual
objects, removed froln their history.

“Mass marketing teaches people to
miss things lhcy never had," she said. “It
creates an cxperlcncc of loss that never
took place. It is imaglited nostalgia for a
native that never was, the Noble Savage
In harmony with all nature, addressingthc
wrongs of patriarchal capitalism,"

In addition to mlssing the cultural im-
portance ofmuch of NativeAmcrican tra-

the colonial

dition, NANA misconstrues feminism, part
of what attracts so many women to it in
the ﬁrst place. Donaldson said NANA pre»
sents feminism as process of“rlareissistic
individual growth rather than a politicﬁ
movement of equality."

Donaldson is an associate professor of
English, women’s studies and American

University of Iowa, and the author of
Decolonizing Femitlixms: Race, Gender
and Empire Building. She was a Senior

Ethernet to be installed in residence halls

BY PHOEBE SILAG
Staff Writer
Students with personal computers
soon will be able to access the College's
computer network without tying up
phone lines in North Campus dorms. Ina
stallation of wiring for Ethemet will be
gin in Norris Hall after Alumni Reunion
Weekend this summer, according to Bill
Francis, director of Computer Services.
The installation of Ethernet at Grinnell
is in sinc with the trend on campuses
across the nation. A committee includ-

ing students, members ol’Coniputcr Scr-
vices,'raculty, Facilities Management and
various administrators has been formed
to plan Grinnell's installation

“Our goal is to do all North campus
dorms thls summer," Francis said. Fol-
lowing the ering ofdomis tudenls will
be able to purchase Ethcinct cards to be
installed in computers that Will allow con-
nection to lhe network. According to
committee member Andrew Nashel ('99),
the cards currently run anywhere from
$60 to $100, and hopefully will he sold

wtth correlating software at a student rate
in the Grinnell College Bookstore,

“The College will probably buy the
hardware and software in bulk," Nashcl
said, “and if students buy tiieiii through
the bookstore they'll be [compatible with
Grinnell's network]?

According to Francis, most comput»
crs produced in the last three years have
Ethernet capability, Grinnell may coopr
crate with a computer store in Des
Moines to provide special deals on com»
pulers and computer servicing, Francis

sald.

Colnputer Services will begin work
on South Campus residence halls in
the summer of 1998. “We really can‘t
go into the halls and tear up the rooms
like we need to during the academic
year," Francis said “We hope to com-
plete the proyect in two years, and
certainly in three."

A supplement with exact specifica-
tions for hardware and software nec-
essary to access Ethernet will appear
in a future Computer Services news-
letter.
