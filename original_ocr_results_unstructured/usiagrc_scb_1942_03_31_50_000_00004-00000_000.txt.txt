It ‘ain’t All Misery!

Condii‘ioning

By putting Gl'illnell men
through their paces at the
daily conditioning periods,
more than 15 uppel‘tlbssmcn
are gaining experience in the
handling of large groups, cspcc-
ially since who drills practiced are
regular army workouts, John C.
Truestlale, director of athletics,
said today.

.Diike also said that Marty on
Connor's experience in setting ‘le
Grinnell‘s conditioning classes had
been instrumental in his obtaining
a position as physical instructor
in the Army Air corps.

Duane Arnold, Paul Bremick-er,
Robert Child, Dud Connor, Mays
new Eaton, ,Lowell cause. Don
Hippie, Carlos Kotila, Hugh Mun
Cortney, Ray Mathews, Reynolds
Norton, Howard Smith, Paul
Speight, Arthur Werlein. and Bill
McKeon were among those who
have been leading classes, Tones-
dale said.

Connor, Goose, Kotila, Norton.
and Wei-loin have proven them-
selves especially capable and have
often substituted for the regular
leaders when the latter have been
away on trips.

Since the experience has proven
so valuable in one case at least,
it has been proposed that these'
student leaders receive letters at
the end of the year stating that
they have had this experience in
group leadership.

Such letters might very likely
prove valuable should the man
enter any of the services, Trues—
dale said.

Cyclone Nears Comple‘lion

ing rapidly, according to Florence
Bennett. editor. When asked if
she wouldn't give a little hint as

your guess is as good as mine.
However, she did say that it
was to come out some time durr
ing May. All pictures and other
work have been complebed.

Brickwork Is
Nearing Finish

Work on the new gym was slow-
ed down by the cold weather di -
ing the past week, but the brick—
work is oxpected to be done by
late Wednesday afternoon, Louis
v. Phelps, college treasurer, said
yesterday.

The workmen are to begin con-
struction of the Lamella roof as
soon as the necessary materials
arrive, though up until Monday
moming nothing had been heard
concerning the shipment.

If the materials do not arrive
within the next week, and if the
weather gets sufficiently milder,
it may be that the concrete sub-
floor will be poured first, so that
the workmen will have an easier
job working on the roof, Phelps
said.

in the future for the French club,
