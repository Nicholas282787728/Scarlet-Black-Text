Ray, however, feels that Schaben has failed

Finally, it is Jim Schaben's contention that
”six years is a long time tor anyone to be

long." But Ray, attempting to win his iourth

view. He declared, “In this campaign tor the

Iowa history, I believe the issue is clear:
Which candidate can do the best job of leading
Iowa from now until 1978’?"

That is the question that the voters will
have to decide.

CULVER
by Patty Rosc-

On Tuesday, November 5, voters in the
state oi Iowa and across lhe nation will he
determining their choices for Congressional
leaders ior the years ahead One oi the races,
in a traditionally “swing" district is the

United States Senate seat bemg vacated by.

Democratic Senator Harold Hughes.

The two opposing candidates for Hughes’
position are Democratic Congressman John
Culver of Cedar Rapids and Republican Dave
Stanley, a state legislator from Muscatine

John Culver was first elected to the U.S.
Congress at the age or 32 in 1954, iresh out oi
Harvard College and its law school, He has
served five terms since lhat date, each time
winning with higher margins. He is also in-
creasingly well-known on Capitol Hill for his
work on Congressional reiorm. campaign
financing, support oi women's rights,
reduction of defense spending, and en»
vironmental issues. For example, on detense
spending he has sai : , . . We need a
modern, mobile and adaptable military
establishment, but We cannot afford the cost
overruns and the superiluous stockpiling lor
the overskill in nuclear weapons . , ."

He also voted [or the Equal Rights
Amendment in 1970 and has cosponsored a
number of feminist-oriented bills, including
ones that would prohibit discrimination by
sex in the granting oiiinancial credit, and one
that would establish a National Center for the
Prevention and Control or Rape.

Culver has received financial contributions
numbering $390,313. He has received the
iinancial support oi o voriely oi national labor
and liberal groups. i: is this issue oi out~ol-
state influence that dominated much of the
campaign‘s earliest stages.

State Senator Dave Stanley has served in
the Iowa Legislature [in twelve years and has
cosauthorcd over 100 bills that cvcntually
became Iowa Statutes One of his most fer»
vent campaign promises has been to take no
contributions from “pressure groups” and
“lobbyists” including those who support his
opponent, lie does, however, receive iunds
from Various Republicansorielltcd

organizations like the National Committee as
well as ironi his family's prospt‘l‘ous
business,

Another of Stanley’s objections to Culver's
record is the issue of absenteeism. In recent
days, he has accused Culver of missing 28 Der
cent of the Congressional votes taken in the
last session, involving some 148 million
dollars in Federal appropriations. Culver
countered by pointing out that he has at~
tended over 37 per cent oi the vote sessions
and spent over 100 days in the state of Iowa
assessing the people’s needs Stanley,
himself claims 99 per cent attendance in the
State Senate, interrupted only by a long
planned trip to Europe with his wiie, which
cut into one legislative session,

Another issue which dominates their
campaign is that oi Culver‘s support oi so
called inilationary legislation. Stanley
recently charged:

“ , During Culver's ten years in
Washington, he voted ior unnecessary
spending that raised the national debt more
than 150 billion dollars . . .” He includes
such issues as Culver‘s support
ol a minor railroad project in indiana as
examples or “wasteful deiicit spending," and
Culver‘s lack of “responsibility to his own
constituents,” He states that he would be
“willing to help President Ford balance the
lederal budget” and reduce inﬂation, unlike
Democratic “big spenders" such as Culver.

However, a study recently released by the
Democratic Study Group of the House,
ironically chaired by Culver, points out that
the Republican charge regarding Democratic
support nI such intlationary legislation is
distorted, Congress added less than one~sixth
of one per cent to the Administration's budget
in thciiscal years oi 1971-73, according to the
study.

Another sharp dlvisi l of views occurs in
the area of consumer-interest laws. Culver
has historically supporlcd and co-sponsored
such protective measures. Stilnley opposes
the iormation of the proposed Consumer
Protection Agency. while Culver supports it.

Throughout the campaign, Leach has ac-
cused Mezvinsky oi accepting contributions
irom special interest groups and sources
outside the state. Mezvilisky's answer has
been, “I think it is a straw man issue. The

concern to Iowans and America in general.
Mezvinsky urges a four-point eiiort to control
it. He wants to “humanize” the lederal

budget, ease the supply oi money, rciorni the
tax structure and get tough on antitrust
cniorcemont. Mozvinsky believes the
iederal budgel should focus on “human"
programs; ioreign military aid should be cut

Generally, Leach believes the budget can
be balanced by keeping expenditures at the
present level rather than making cuts

Some cuts, he believes. can be made in the
deionse budget. He ieels that there should be
a gradual reordering of lederal spending to
reduce the proportion oi iunds going to
defense and increases in the amount going to
health care and housing.

Antitrust laws are advocated by Leach. He
claims he was tile 1’ st candidate in the nation
to ask for anti-trust action at all international
level. Leach feels the u 3 should take the
lead in a ”get tough” position with Arab
nations, inducing them to keep oil prices at
their present level.

Mezvinsky is very much in iovor of social
programs. Housing and health care were
labeled by Mezvinsky as issues oi particular
concern to this district Mezvinsky also cited
education as being important.

Agricultural, as well as educational issues,
{eels Leach, are important to people oi the

porations, “Too many Republicans don’t see
the distlnction between the interests of free
enterprise and the interests of big business,"
he stated.
