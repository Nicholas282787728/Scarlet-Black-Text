lWHY‘ SHOULD BUSINESS HELP
COLLEGES AND STUDENTS?

College educations cost moré today, too!
In fact, for many young men and women
7and for their parentssthe increasing
cost of a college education has become a
major problem. And small, privatelys
ﬁnanced colleges also have found them-
selves threatened by rising costs Yet it

is vitally important to America’s future

that our young people be well educated.

To help promising students and small
colleges, we and other American coin»
panics have taken steps to give ﬁnancial
aid. Standard Oil, for example, has. made
funds available which provide for 34
graduate fellowships and undergraduate
scholarships in science and engineering.
Four-year scholarships awarded through
the National Merit Scholarship Corpora-

tion also are included in this program,
Thirteen students now are attending
school on these scholarships Supplemen-
tziry grants are made to schools chosen
by the Merit Scholarship winners.

In addition, Standard Oil has made
funds available from which $175,000 is
paid yearly to aid privately-ﬁnanced lib-
eral arts colleges in the Midwest and‘
Rocky Mountain statesi .

At Standard Oil, where so much of our
planning concerns the future, we believe
there are few things more vital to the sur-
vival of our democratic, free~enterprise
system than a wellreducnted public.
That’s why we provide for substantial
ﬁnancial aid to both colleges and students.

One way ofjudging a company‘s citizenship is by its

concern for the futureinot for itself alone, but for
the country as it wholoi With business and colleges
working togeLher to build a stronger, more secure
America through education, a brighter future is

assured for us all.

STANDARD 0IL CODIPANY

Dr. luurence M. Gould, president, Carleton
College, Northﬁeld, Minnesota: ”it it were not
for ﬁnancial help from business ergnnizntions,
many enpable studen would be denied 11 col»
lege education. The iir sighted compimies giv-

most vnlunble nntnrdl resources."
