Basically The saint

“Grinnell and Hanpton ore basically the same
type ot
terrnces.
Ulul an
a semeste s Well: at Hampton,

t One of the most noticeable differences s in
the s ciul Setup It is based more on group ac-
tivity at Hampton than on strict dating, said ‘Lhe
tit-o girl .A. completely iiir al atmosphere por-
varlr. rill social events, of which there a’re many
College mixers. social clubs, hall function, moms
and all other activrties are conveniently looa
right on campus. ‘

Phyllis and Margaret found a more active‘
Stodent’Council on the Hampton campus. "It
possesses much power sLdLed Phyllis, "and we
found that almosl anything could be ace plished
on the campus if it were backed by e student
Council.” A central office, with the president of
the Council often frequenting rt, is the head
quarters for gripes and discussions 0[ all sorts,
The student body as a whole takes a great deal
of interest in and concern over what goes on at
their school, as is registered by the lalge :lLtellr
dance at the open Student Council meeting.

Hampton Spirit

“In fact: said Margaret and Pllyllls, “Humps

The Hampton spirit pr. trates all school activities
with the attitude toward school being much dil
fel'ent‘, than in most United states colleges. Few
remarks were made against Hampton by the stir-
doiits, who hold a great love for their school, and
are intent upon getting the most out at college,

Both girls preferred Crinncll's system of “'07
men's goicrimiciit to that of Hampto; where
little ahtho ty is placed in the hands of the gain
ernmg body the Wamen‘s senate, It makes the
generul policies, but all rules a .d r iletions are
enforced l , the motions o hoirsomother-s.

After a semester at Hampton Phyllis and
Margaret reported that “It is drtfic it to put into
words our feeling of 'one-lless' with a race so often
pushed into the background, We w rc made to
feel as though -o really belonged They 'ex-
