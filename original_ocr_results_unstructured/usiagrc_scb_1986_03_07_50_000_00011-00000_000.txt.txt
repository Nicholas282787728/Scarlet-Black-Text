Swinging Away

by Paula Rue

The Grinnell College Women's Softball
Team is also off and swinging as their
season is almost ready to get under way.
Led by co-Head Coaches Deb McCarty and
Jim Gilbert, the team numbers 17 players,
including 7 freshman. 2 sophomora, 3
juniors, and 5 seniors. Returning letter
winners for the Pioneers include Terri
Porter, Susan Peters, Jerri Matchinsky,

. MJ. Constant. Liz Schumacher, and Flora

Winitz.

Both Gilbert and McCarty have noted
that there is some lack of experiencé clue
to a higher number of freshman on this
year’s team; however, they are pleased
with the effort and eagerness of the
players.

Practice began on February ill in Darby,
and both coaches have been quite pleased
with practices so far. Starting positions
have not been firmly established;
however. the coaches and team members
are working to fill the spots. According to
Coach Gilbert and Coach McCarty, filling
the pitching spot will be the hardest. Cur-
rently, they are working with 5 or 5 players
to round out the squad.

“Prospects for this year look very
good,‘" says McCarty. Gilbert agreed with
this and mentioned that the team is going
to be an aggressive one; they will em-
phasize an aggressive offense. ‘_‘Mv

philosophy is if you’re not making
mistakes, then you're not trying hard
enough. We want to emphasize an ag-
gresslve oitense; we have to be aggressive
if we want to win. But above all, I want the
girls to have fun."

a The team has a shorter schedule this
season than in previous years, with their
main competition expected to be irom (Zoe
and Monmouth. The women have 3 road
doubleheaders and 4 home doubleheaders
for a total of 14 games. They open their
season at home on Wednesday, April 2 at
4 : 30 pm. against Marshalltown Communi-

ty College.
