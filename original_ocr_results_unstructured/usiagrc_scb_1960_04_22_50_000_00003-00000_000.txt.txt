'Coo/ ' Five Play Oldies, M odems

by Stall Revol‘lci‘

“Cool Dad, 0001!”,This pro-
found statumem is one individr
Hal’s reaction to the music of

Hero Hancock’s quintet. VVhélli-l’
or in thc colloquial ”good" sense ,

oi the. word “cool” or in the
harmonic sense, the expression
is a good one no use when
speaking of this group or swing-
ing Grinnellians.

Organized last iall, the group
consists oi.le7a’der Herb Him»
cock irom Chicago, on piano;
John Scott irom Lexington,
lll., on trumpet; Bub Taylor,
Grinnell, trombone; Phil Bar
lick, Bolton, 111., hiss; and
Steve Hecht, New York City,
drums. The group has played
many jobs on and on cam-
pus this year. Recent engage-
ments have included a few at
the state University or Iowa.

The quintet not only plzlysl
many “standards” such as “My
Funny‘ Valentine“ or “When I
Fall in Love," but most of thej
group’s up—tempo tunes are
modern ones with dimcult chord
changes. Tunes such as “Stable'—‘
mates" or Benny Golson's “Along;
Came Belly" are standard rcp-
ertoire in addition to many rhod—
crn blues tunes. Hancock andY
Scott have written jazz originals,
for the group; which means, in
the words oi Hancock, ”We play
a lot oi tunes no one else
playsxi ,

The mainstays o: the rhythm
section, Mcssis. Hocht and Ba—
lick, have s'tudtcd their respec-
tive instruments, drums and
bass, since they were sopho-
mores in high school. _

Hecht lists as his_ favorite

drummers Chico Hamilton, Son-
t ny Payne and Philly Joe Jones,

He has studied with Buddy
Rich's teacher and has had con-
siderable playing experience in
the New York City and upper
New York state areas,

Phil Balick, bass inan, has
played ior four years. Phil has
had much playing experience
around the Chicago area includ—
ing an engagement with a group
at Chicago’s Brass Rail.

Paul Chambers and Bay Brown]
are Ballck's iavorites on bassl
"Chambel‘s’ conccption is great,l
and Brown does some really
fantasllc \ll’llngs that nobody
else seems to be able .to do on

,Bass," states Balick,

Bob “Tails" Taylor, the
group's .tromhonist, seems to
idolize n'c'omposite image oi
scveral' \Vellrknown jazzmen.
"If 1 hall'lhe iunkiness oi isill
Harris, the technique of J, J.
Johnson, the lyricism oi Miles
Davis and the ideas oi John
Coltrane, I would he ,very
happy,” Taylor stated. “I’d be
a gas!” '
Taylor, a freshlllan,_ has hccn

playing trombone since sixth

grade. “I really liked Dixieland
'mthosc days,” he explained, “and
could think of nothing ﬁner than,
playing in a Dixieland bandl

Times sure have changed. Last
summer I played in a Tampa

stomp ivy Leaguetypc Dixie;

group and quit alter t‘wo wueks.t

‘. Although the piano man“
did have a terriﬁc lcit liand...i

sounded like a tuna."

He lists as his main inﬂuence
trumpeter Miles Davis. “Miles
doesn’t play a lot oi notcs—just'
tlle pretty ones.”

Two oi the Hancock—Scott
tunes, “Portrait oi Miles” and
“Griffin," have been well
ccived in the Chicago jazz
world, and ”Portrait oi Miles”
is presently being played on
the road by the Philly Joe Jones
group. Jones is acknowledged
as the host oi the modern drain
iners by a vast majority- at
modern jazz musicians.

0n trumpet. Scott likes Miles
Davis and Art Farmer, but
his greatest inﬂuences, are
John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins
and Johnny Gridin, all tenor
mcn.

Scott is a scrious student oi
jazz, and his one ambition is to
play it. He plans to attcnd the
Berkelcy School of Music this
summer and hopes to continue
there. ‘

.Hcrh Hancock, leader and
mainstay oi the group, is a
“comer" on the Chicago jazz
scene. He started piano at the
age oi seven, and at 11 he play-
ed with the Chicago Symphony
in one oi its young people’s
concerts. Active in jazz since
his sophomore year, in high
school, he is beginning to make
it on the Chicago sccnc.

IInncuCk has played in some

of the best of the city’s scs'd

sioiis such as the Archway,
Llie' Sutherland and 'the Gate
oi Horn, and with some at the
best Chicago mus inns such

as Ira Sullivlul, Eddic Harris, 1

Rolantl‘ Faulkner, etc. To the
reader’ iiiincquaintcd with the
Chicago scene, this is Some~
thing to lirng ahout tor a play»
er oi Hancock’s yeai .

Hancock plans to compose and
arrange as' well as play, and

,thcsc who have heard his' tvot~lc,Jt‘., editor set

in this area know that much

future. The bulk of thc Credit

mentioned above he.‘
llongs to Hancock, and he has
written many of his own tunes
as well as contemporary clas-l
sical works. .

Bill Evans hcads the list of
Hancock’s favorite pianists.
Other inllucnccs are John Col-
trane (a pretty unanimous
choice oi the group {or musi-
cian oi the decade), Hank
Jones, and Miles Davis. He
also likes the work oi oom—
iioscr-arrangers Gil Evans and
Quincy Jones and the big
hands oi Jones, Basic, and
Kenton.

Hancock has-either playcd in
or led a group throughout his
tour years at Grinnell and
names the present one as the

l‘Vl‘hei-e's something happening
lvvith this group. Most of the
lguys are seriously interested in
jazz and are trying to say some-
thing of their own. It makes
playing a gig more than just
another dance job."

He's right. Their music is
danceable, and it says some-
thing.

There is a lot’happcning.
