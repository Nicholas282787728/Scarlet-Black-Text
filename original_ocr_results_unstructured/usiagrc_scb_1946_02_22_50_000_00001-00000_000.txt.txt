Carl J. Friedrich, professor 01" government at Har-

vard university, this morning advocated a constitutional
change wllich would result in a greater participation on the

part of the American people in foreign affairs. In the opell-’

ing lecture in a Series of five analyzing the relations of
Various world powers to each other and the UNO, Dr, Fried-

ricll suggested that a foreign

affairs council.comparable to

1:116 current senate affairs committee, be set up on an

‘elective basis.

Dr. Friedrich also advanced the
belief that the United States re-i
presentatives to the UNO assemb-
ly should be elected by the
American people, rather than
appointed by the president.

_In surveying the world situation
at the present time, Dr. Fried-
rich said the world
realism. ”Everyone seems al-
most afraid of idealism." Since
the UNO ‘15 actually a world or-
ganization, it does not need the
idealism which supported the
League of Nations after'the last
war, he continued, but can afford
to be more realistic.

After the overwhelming adop-
tion of the UNO proposals by
congress came the atomic bomb.
"The atomic bomb heightened the
desire to hen war, but it also
heightened the elements which
cause war, especially fear," Dr.
Friedrich said. “It has plunged
us into a situation full of the
most dangerous potentialities for
another wan"

"World government is the
only solution to the problems
of the atomic age," Dr. Fried-
rich sun-ml This solution in-
volves the problems 01 Russia,
which are no longer remote, but
have moved to the center of one
intimate concern.

"Every intelligent American
ought to familiarize himself with
the pattcms of thought which

prevail in the Soviet Union. We
