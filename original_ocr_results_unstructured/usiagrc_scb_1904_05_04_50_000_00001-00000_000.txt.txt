In a game marked by wonder
t’ul hitting and star ﬁelding on the
part or Antes, Gtinnell went down
in defeat yeslert‘lav afternoon and
losttlie disputed championship oi
the season of 1903 The score
was II [D O.

The deteat may be explained by
the statement that Ames could
hit, while Grinnell at no time dur-
ing the game could solve Yank
Weisbrod

pitched good ball, and with better

Brown’s delivery,

support, the score would have
been much smaller, but the ﬁeld

ing ot the Grinnell team was
erratic and only tour of Ames'
runs were earned.

The work or Fillmore and Bar.
ber was fast, and they repeatedly
drew applause trom the Ames
bleachers, by accepting dimcult
chances, live or which came to
Captain Fillmore. .

In the inﬁeld Howard and
Schilling played good ball, but as
a whole the work ot the team was
ragged, while the Ames aggrega-
tion played like a bunch ot pi‘o’s,

The day was ﬁne and the crowd
was large.

The vocal part ot the pro-

and entirely satisfactory method,

Mrs, Burr furnished the accom-
companiments with taste and dis-
cretion. Miss Schiller sang
Liszt’s “Lorelei” with dramatic
force and followed this bv the
“l’olacco” from “Mignon” by
Thomas, executing the coloratura

also sang a group ot songs by

"The best Home Meet in the
history or the school" was Jack
Watson's comment Saturday as
'he ﬁred the shot that started the
last race of the day and Jack cere
tainly ought to know. From the
point or view of the spectator the
mcct bore several resemblances
to a three ring circus with the
ﬁeld and track events and a
twelve inning ball game with Coe
all going at once and with the
seniors tor clowns. No one could
complain that it was not interest-
ing but several contracted stirt
necks or headaches item the ex-
citement.

The senior parade opened the
events. warbu-rton's cow, gay in

and thescnioi-s bearing placards

By the time the rooting squads

were on the track and the event
was as soon over, Templeton win

shore a good third. Longshore

expected he will show up much
better at the Drake dual next
Saturday. The pole vault was
won by Walleser.'o3, ato ft. 5%
whose points could not be count
ed.

"Dad” Green, as was expected,
won the shot put with a good put
of 36 tt, i, which compares quite
favorably with the home record

of 36%. Pringle took the mile in
4:50 a mark which he could easily
have battered had he been hard
pushed. Mcllrath took second
and Clark sprinted into third at
the tape, Spencer bettered the
homerecord tor ttie broad jump

In a tttclve inning ganteot base-
ball Grinnell defeated Coe 6 to 5,
upon Saturday- last. The visiting
team proved an extremely strong
aggregation and siionld receive
naught but praise. Excitement
was at [ever height during the last
lew innings when the score re-
mained tied with neither side able
to tally. In thc tweltth inning
Cos was retired in one, two, three
order and the scarlet and black
settled down to win. B e nson

brod hit, Davis reached ﬁrst upon
an error, and Swalm brought in
the winning run. For Grinnell
Fillmore was in the box during
the ﬁrst three innings, then retired
in favor of Weisbrod, Both did
