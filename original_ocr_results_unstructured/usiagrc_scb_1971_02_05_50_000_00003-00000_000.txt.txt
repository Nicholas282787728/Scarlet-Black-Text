Norris Pelilion ”Not A Joke”

(continued from page 1)

He continued, "Some of the
petition is written in a hums
orous vein, but it‘s not ajoke.
It was done gDDd’naIUIEdly bee
(muse the people have learned
to live with things, not be
cause they aren’t serious."

"The Norrises have a bad
reputation,” said Scribner.
”Mike Daley tame here as
president this year determin-
ed to change that, and he has
really succeeded."

"What {would really hate is
if this thing is reported so
people don’t ever want to live
here," Abdallah added.

A brief tour of the dorm cons
vinces anyone that its only
problems are structural - and
serious. The entire campus
obviously joins Norris resi*
dents in hoping that next
week’s meeting will lead to
quick correction of the peti-
tion grievances.

WE, the undersigned residents
of Norris Hall respectfully
submit the following sugges-
tions in an effort to prevent
the complete collapse of the
mental conditions of the in—
mates living herein.

THE Norrises were complet-
ed in 1960 at a cost of over
half a million dollars. To*
day, ten years later, the

Hall is in despicable condi»
tion due topoor construCtion
and poor design. We rmlize

recoup our losses is out of
the question, but we strange
1y urge the college to reach
a little deeper into its rapid-
ly depleting reserves and
repair this eyesore before it
falls or is torn down by the
aforementioned inmates in
an uncontrollable act of
rage. We realize the cost of
such improvements will be
difficult to cover, but it will
be harder to cover the cost
of condemning and rebuild'
ing Norris at a later date if
it is not fixed now.

OUR suggestions and their
justifications are herewith
submitted in order ofprior-
ity:

A) Norris must be converted

into a co-ed hall. Norris is,
for all intents andpurposes,
isolated from the rest of the
campus physimllyaswellas
socially. It is felt that the
conversion to a cor ed com-
plex will alleviate thispres-
sing problem and assuage
the severe mentalandsocial
alienation now prevalent in
the hall. For example,many
freshmen have been unable
to develop normal social re-
lationships with women on
campus.
This conversion can be made
by expanding the restrooms
into the singles adjacent to
them and adding extra
toilets.

B) Drastic improvement of
the soundproofing should be

undertaken immediately.
Some kind of soundproofing

is definitely necessary as

normal conversations can
be heard several rooms
away and the walls (an be
physically moved up to one
half inch in some cases. The
high level of noise that re-
sults forces many people to
the library to study. This is
an unfair imposition on these
people, Moreover, allsocial
gatherings and music are
shared by the rest of the
dorm and inhibited by the
fear of disturbing others.

C) Steps should be taken to
change the present policy of
exiling so many freshmen
into Norris.

This practice further iso~

lates the freshmen from the
campus community and es-

pecially from most uppers
classmen.

D) The entire hall should be

given a bright, new imagin-
alive paint job.
Norris is now painted an
institutional beige that is a
major cause for the severe
depressions plaguing the in-
habitants of the hall. It is
our belief that a little brir
ghter color in the roomsand
particularly in the halls and
stairways is urgently need-
ed.

E) The heating switches in
each room should be made
operational.

The heating system of the
hall is in no way controlled
by the people who live in it.
Building and Grounds might
be called to help with the
problem, but there is really
no way it can be changed to
suit the weather outside.

F) More lights and electrical

outlets should be installed
in each room.
Unlike every other dorm on
campus, there are noceiling
lights. The two or three
college furnished lights in
each room are woefully ins
adequate to light the entire
room. This poor lighting
leads to chronic eye strain
for the residents.

G) Carpeting should be in-
stalled in every room and,
if possible, every hallway.
The carpeting would do a
great deal to relieve the in-
stitutional sterility thateach
room has. Carpeting would
help relieve the mental tur-
moil as well as the noise
problem.

WE trust that these grievances
will receive your sincere
attention and will rank high
amonst your list of prior
ities.

(continued from page 1)

'of his businessassociates; and

to damage his business."

The suit is similartoonethat
Wilhelm filed in Augist, 1969,
but voluntarily withdrew due
to irregularities in legal pro
cedures which the college law?
yers had pointed out. The new
suit was filed just within the
two-year limitAtion for suits
of this type. »

Wilhelm told the 5&8 that he
has hired a new, much more
experienced lawyer to pursue
the case. Wilhelm said thatthe
college was obviously at fault
and that the only question in his
mind was how much money he
would be awarded.

He postulated that if it
weren't forpersonalprejudice
against him on the part of the
college that the case might
have easily been settled out of
court; however, he acknow-
ledges that the college's int
surance company might re-
quire formal court proceed-
ings.

Wilhelm recalls that he was
willing to ignore Fischer's
story (which he didn't hear
broadcast), but he became ups
set when Mrs. Prescott sent
out the editorial as a press
release with what he regarded
as a very damaging cover let-

ter. He noted that neither she
nor anyone else ever apolo-
gized to him about the matter,
and he postulated that they
might even believe that the
allegation is true. He regards
it as preposterous and feels
that the accusation is a direct
assault on the Women‘s Libe
eration Movement sincelt im-
plies that, as females, they
were unable to plan such a
protest themselves. Wilhelm
has admitted that he was pre-
sent when the protest was
organized, but denies that he
participated in the planning.

Wilhelm was enrolled at the
college until 1967 when he was
dismissed for academic rea~
sons. At that time he was co-
editor of the yearbook, which
the college refused to publish
on the grounds that parts of
the book were potentially ll-
belous. Wilhelm has attemp—
ted to have the book published
independently; but ithasnever
appeared, apparently for fin-
ancial reasons.

President Glenn Leggett's
only comment on the matter
was a philosophical ”let the
courts decide." The college's
local lawyer would discuss
only technical matters. Mrs.
Prescott has consistently re-
fused to comment on the case.

'Cocltlnil Pnriy’ Opens Feb. 23

The second semester theatre

season will open February 23
in Arena Theatre witha con-
temporary moral comedy, ens
titled “The Cocktail Party,”
by T.S. Eliot.

First produced at the Edin-
burgh Festival in 1949, “The
Cocktail Party" was brought
to,the_United,S,tates in 1950.
The New York Times reviewed
the work, commenting, “Mr.
Eliot is saying that there are
only a few of this globe’s ine
habitants who are equipped to
‘live their own lives,' or, as
the phrase used to be, to live
dangerously, to refuse to com-
promise with life.”NedDonar
hoe, director of the produc-
tion, adds, ”Eliot calls the
play a comedy. But, although
there is marital sniping and
extraemarital confusion, it
certainly is not a bedroom
farce. No Wifemswapping‘fun-
inrbed charade, 'The Cocktail
Party' has been called amorr
ality play. So, maybe it’s a
moral Comedy" , , certainlynot
a comic morality."

Cast in the roles of guest-sat
the party are Rob Sackett, the

Grinnell will participate in a
new experimental program in
theatre education, the National
Theatre Institute, at the
Eugene O'Neill Theatre Cen-
ter in Waterford, Conn.

The program began this past
fall as a three-year experi-
ment offering students a some
ester of study with profes-
sional theatre artists in a
workshop environment.

Students spend 13 weeks in
residence at O’Neill studying
all aspects of the theatre-s
acting, directing, design, pro-
ductionrras well as related
areas suchaspuppetry, dance,
mime and film.

Each semester includes nine
weeks of instruction, a week‘
of working sessions in New
York City, and three weeks of
fullttime rehearsal on a new
play. At the close of the sem-
ester, the students perform
the play on tour for twoweeks.
Interested applicants should
contact James Reeder, chair-
man of the department of
theatre. ‘

The $818 is still in great
need of photographers. Dark-
room privileges will be ex-
changed for assignment work
and also assigned darkroom
work. Contact Marty Sachs,
photo editor, at ext. 565.
