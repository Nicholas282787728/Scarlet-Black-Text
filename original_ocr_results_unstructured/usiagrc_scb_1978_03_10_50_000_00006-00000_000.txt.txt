“Klute” shows Fonda at her best

by Nancy Carpenter

None of these movies are exactly
the type to chase away them
naughty midterm blues . . but
some of them are wellrmade and
entertaining, most notably Klutc,
The Killers. and Adulell ill.

Klutc (197i) wouldn't be much of
a film Without Jane Fonda, It‘s an
overdone thriller, complete with
all the conventional claptrap'
repetitive horror-tingle music,
lurking shadows, artsy
photography, psychopathic sex
fiends, a last~minute rescue.
You’ve seen it all a hundred times
before, done Well in some of the
film noir classics and done notrso-
well in B movies and TV films

But Jane Fonda‘s performance
transforms this schlocky film into
a suspenseful piece of en.
tertainment. She plays Bree, a call
girl who is trapped by a way of life
which causes her to be both in-
vestigated by a detective and
stalked by a pervert. Donald
Sutherland, as the detective, is
kept busy searching for a missing
friend, trying to ferret out the
murderer, and engaging in hanky-
panky With the call girl. Fonda, an
Academy Award winner, was
praised by the critics; it is
generally agreed that this is the
best performance oi her career.

Wild River (1960) is cosponsored
by the history department. It’s the
Story of how the Tennessee Valley
Authority, in the course of building
16 dams across the Tennessee
River, sent a government engineer
to a small Southern town to con
vince a strongwilled, 80 year old

 

woman to leave the island her
husband had cleared years ago
Montgomery Clift, as the engineer,
has to deal with smalletown
bigotry, the Violence oi a near
lynching, and the disapproval of
the octogenarian While he carries
on a love affair with her grands
daughter.

Director Elia Kazan has a
reputation of getting wonderful
periormances from actors. He also
has a reputation for having a big
mouth, which he used to get a lot of
people in trouble with the House
Committee on UnrAmerican Aer
tivities at one time. Of course.
some people might say that art
transcends life and Kazan's stint
as a talkative witness has nothing
to do with the quality of the iilms
he made. Ihope those people enjoy
the film

The Western European
Civilization Series offers two films
this weeks Kuhle Wanipe (1932),
With a screenplay by Bertolt
Brecht, is of historical interest as
the last film made in Germany
before Hitler otiicially took power
and as such reflects the social
conditions of the time.

The film deals with the sad
history ofa working class family in
Berlin; the son commits suicide
after a long stretch of unemr
ployment, the daughter is forced
into a sordid marriage by
pregnancy, and the iamily moves
to a primitive shack on the out-
_sktrls oi town, Brecht‘s script
makes bitter barbs against the
Nazis but, ironically, the film ends
on a forced note oi optimism as

thousands oi young people at the
Sports Festival cheer the praises oi
a new German regime.

The other film of the series is
Adaleii :n (1969), a lyric tragedy
about an industrial Strike in the
Adalen district of Sweden in 1931.
Director Bo Widerberg has a
penchant for visual beauty in his
films that culminated in his Elvira
liiniiigan. This movie has that
same Renoirrlike compositional
beauty but, like Elvira liindigan,
tends to drag a bit

Wlderberg is at his best when he
pairs the visual abilities of his art
with a strongly dramatic or comic
elementﬁlike the scene in Adaleii
31 of a young boy attempting to
seduce girls by means of hyp-
notism, This movie is not profound
or sophisticated but it has a lovely
period look to it and a feeling for
the beauty that Widerberg sees
even in man's ugliest moments.
The Killers (1945), loosely based
on Ernest Hemingway's short
story of the same name, is part of
the film noir series. This is the
early (and better) version with
sultry Ava Gardner, Burt Lane
caster and Edmund O'Brien, The
story involves two proressional
assassins whose curiosity about a
Victim‘s refusal to run leads them
to a million dollar payroll, Who
said curiosity killed the cat” Ava
Gardner plays a treacherous iox
who double crosses her man not
once, but twice, This film marks
Burt Lancaster’s film debut and
was directed by one of Hollywood‘s
most unappreciated German
imports, Robert Siodmak.

New evaluation system voted

13 meeting. As for Connelly's
argument that the proposed
system was dehumanizing, Kurtz
responded, “Wc' will begin with
humans and end with humans, but
in between, let‘s get the best kind
of data we can.”

Many of the faculty agreed with
Kurtz in concluding that the
present system is inadequate. In
addition to the problems pointed
out by Kurtz, it was also claimed

by some that the present svstem is
not statistically Sound, and that 40

students is too small a body to
constitute a representative, ran
dom sampling.

ASSISTANT Professor of:
Mathematics Henry Walker noted
that the 40 students are drawn
from courses taught by a professor
over a three year period. This
breaks down to approximateJy two
students interviewed per class, he
explained. “I can‘t imagine that
two people can represent the at-
titudes of an entire class." he said.

it was argued that the proposed
system, by requiring all students to
respond, would improve the
quality of data upon which the
evaluations are based.

HOWEVER, there were a
number of proiessors who argued
against adopting the proposed
system.

Connelly claimed that the,
proposed system would only}
measure a professor’s ”classroom
demeanor, the personality he
projects.” What the forms do notl
measure, he argued, is the
professor's “ability to make
choices, his selection of what goes
into the course." By reﬂecting a
professor‘s popularity rather than
his teaching effectiveness, he
charged. the new system will force
professors to be more concerned
with popularity than with “the
substantive, educational effect of
teaching.”

ASSISTANT Professor of
Political Science Ira Strauber
remarked that he had serious
doubts about the educational value
of the new system “I don’t want to
give the sense that this device (the

. new‘ zevaluation systeinihas
- anything to, do curricular

matters," he said.

As at the February 13 meeting, a
few professors seemed to argue
against, both systems, urging a
reduced student role in faculty
evaluation. Professor of History
Don Smith maintained that such
evaluation was ”faculty respon-
sibility. , Evaluation should be
something for colleagues,” he
stated. Smith argued it was unfair
for the faculty to try and “put some
of the burden on the students,"

OTHER faculty members ex
pressed reluctance at having to
vote for a'new evaluation system
without first seeing the new form
to be implemented.

Dean Walker, a strong
proponent of the proposed system
at the first meeting, countered by
stating that the faculty was con-
sidering the principle of end-of-
Course evaluations rather than the
instrument to be used. He said mat
it would be “ludicrous" to discuss
the actual evaluation form before
the entire faculty.

AT THE February 13 meeting
Dean Walker had announced that
the form under consideration by
the Executive Council was ’a
standardized numericallyeranked
soonestion iorm developed using
other schools’ course evaluation
form: as models.

Faculty response to that par-
ticular form has been unfavorable.
Coordinator of Academic Com~
puting and Resident Statistician
Tom Moberg stated that he had “a
lot_of Objections to it.” And Kurtz
admitted at Monday's meeting that
the first form was “not a good

 

 

one."

THE FORM ullimateiy to be
used is to be drawn up by Dean
Walker and the Executive Council,
The originally proposed form will
not be used, though Walker stated
that it could ”be used as a model"
in creating the form that will be
implemented,

walker said that he was pleased
the Council‘s proposal passed by
such a substantial margin after
being defeated two weeks earlier.
He noted that there were “a lot of
reversals of votes . . . A lot of
people.” he said regarding the first
vote. “did not realize that voting no
was voting for the continuation of a
bad system."

CONNELLY felt that he will
have no problem living with the
new system. However he stated
that the outcome of Monday's vote
was “unfortunate."

"A system that requires senior
faculty members to guide junior
faculty members is what we want.
A system that is prooi against
popularity is what we want. But
maybe what we want we can’t

ge ,” he said,
