THE RAPID advance that tootr
ball has achieved In the west the
past few years has excited Cone
siderable comment. It has been
the custom in all western instittlr
tions or prominence to provide as
coac‘isome playcrwliohasleamed
the game in an has“ i college.

. eatm so
coached have had a decided ad-
vantage; tiger those that_ have
clung to the old methods. The
past two years Grinnell. through
the kindness of the business men
of the city and her alumni has
had a share in the advancement
of the game and at the same time
has forced recognition of her abil-
ity upon the colleges and univer-
sities of reputation long estab—
lished. For these and other ta-
vors the college is grateful. But
the question now is not what we
have done. but what shall we do“
An effort is now being made to
raise a fund with which to con-
tinue the services of our football
coach. Shall that effort be suc—
cessful? It is true that times are
very close, but can we attoro to
lose our prestige ot the last tew
years and fall back to the level of
mediocrity? A winning team is
as much the pride of the city as it
is of the college. Our team this
year must he composed largely of
raw material and to have a winning
team we must have a competent
coach. To provide one the funds
mustberaiscdimmediately. The
opportrrnity will he onered within
the next week to contribute. Let
everyone do what he can.

teams will line up tor the regular
