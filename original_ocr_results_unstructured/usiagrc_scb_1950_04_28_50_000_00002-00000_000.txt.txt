Letters-"Not to the Editor

Persuant to certain dicta pronounced in a recent coil-
i‘ocltioli, selected yolin_ ladies on Grinnell campus have be
gllr receiving i arnillg notices concerning their personal
bel' vior. This is ill line with top level administrative policy
in ' as such i relatively unquestionable.

Howey r, we do have comment to make on this matter.

Il_ is ill line with top level S & B editorial policy.

What we would like to know is this: how in the name
01' the great god justice do you decide what is acceptable
>le 1 behavior and what isn’t‘.7

It must be presumed that tlle names of tlle young
lalli s who have received warning letters were turned into
the proper administrative office by someone It is not d
limit to imagine who the informers are. But, discarding
the realm of pure conjecture, we can without fear 0t~ coi-
i‘e t on say that more than one person is involved.

Presuming the number of informants to be appr
iii ly eight, we can with little tlouble imagine eight dis-
tinctly different moral coodes, eight totally dissimllz ~ levels,
of iterpretation of what is acceptable and what is not,
aecl rding to the administration’s formula.

We, alid probably a good many others, would like to see
formula written oilt on a blackboard. It would be fas-
ing‘ to see a chart showing the valences for liandliold~i
oscillations, and embraces, simple and complex.

Let's see now, six of these, plus four of these, and one
vo of those. Ah, that sholild do it, send her ot'l' a letter.

ll Letters To The Editor

Tu the Editor:

Thcrc are ii number of people
in Grinnell and colleges and
universities throughout ihc coun-
try who belong to the “ivory
tdwei‘” school cl thought, They
belicvc that it is to a person's
advantage to isolate himself
iroin society.

At this time, at this crisis in
the nation’s and ClVlllZathulS
history this type of philosophy
is dangerous, because of th?
need to vote intelligently, to
appoint llic most intelligent
politicians, and to bring pres»
surc to bear on these politicians
in order that one’s personal
safety might be assured, and
the country stay on its feet.

The most important point
about this "ivory tower" School
of thought is that it has as
niemhel‘s some of the most in~
tolligent, or potentially intelc
ligent, young people in the
Country, men and women who
should be pdwers in local, na-
tional, and international afc
fairs in a Very short time.

It is not only impossible for
n to live in this present
highly developed com—
munication and interdependence
without being eflected by sock
ei)‘, it is dangerous td his own
best interests. Students who
would isolate themselves from
society are a hundred years he-
hind the times There are too
many of them in Gi‘lnnell.

Dear sirs:

We realize that in the journal-
tic profession It is seldom p

iof Republicanism, and exist forlsiblc to avoid mistakes and mic,

prints completely. However, we
must request a correction at
one particularly grievous error
in your last issue ,
You stated that the Brown
Derby \vaiters' race betwcc the
Quad and Cowles was "on
unconditionally by the Quad
men," '
New, Gentlemen, we all know
that such a mistake is complete-
iy ridiculous since the Cowles
team won in a walkraw y
thciugh using tray stands from
the Quad. As this and past races
have shown, Cowles waiters are
unquestionably better at can

ing oranges on a tray than any

,team which the Quad ever as-
sembled.

In fact, not in the
memory of any living Grinnel-
lian has th ~e been a time when
Coivles waiters were not faster,
more ciiicienl, heater, and more
skilllul waiters than the so-call-
ed “Quad men.”

We kncw that you will recog-
hire the Justice df this Colin
plalnt; and we trust that to preA
serve the honor of Cowles waif—
crs imbesmirched. you will cor-
rect this most unfortunate error
as soon as possible. Tiic Cowles
