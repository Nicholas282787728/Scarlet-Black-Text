The Nazn seduction of the masses

IS) scott llildula

Surprisingly to most students of Nazi
history, the Nazis deliberately made
their propaganda entertaining.
historian Bruce F. Pauley said. “Their
rallies were so entertaining that people
actually paid to get in."

Pauley. currently a proiessor oi
history at the University of Central
Florida and a Grinnell graduate in the
class oi '59, was on campus this week to
deliver two lectures an Austrian Nazi
antlrSemitism and Nazi propaganda.

While conducting research in Austria
on Nazi propaganda prior to 1933,
l’aulcy gained some interesting and
surprising insights into the early partof
the fascist movement.

“lBetween 1918 and 1933] the Nazi
propaganda leaders were telling lower
level propagandists not to lie.” he said.
“This surprised me. Finally I decided
that they were saying that because they
didn't want to get caught in a lie. 0i
course one can exaggerate, give only
part of the truth. or distort the truth , . ,
wlllch they did.”

The Nazis had to base their propagane
da on the truth prior to 1933 because
competing iorces could have exposed
them. discrediting their cause. Pauley
said. At that time. there was a free
press operating in both Austria and
Germany.

"After 1933 they didn't have to worry
about getting caught in a lie because no
other newspapers or competing parties
could challenge them." he said.

Pauley attributes the well developed
propaganda machine as being very in-
strumental in the Nazi rise to power,
While accusations have been made that
the Nazis were actually being iunded by
capitalists and other sources. he said.
the propaganda was sellsustaining.

“Sometimes they were able to charge
as much as $1.75 for one admission.”
Pauley said. “That may not sound like
much today . . , but it is equivalent to
Stain in today's money." While this
may have been the fee [or the best seats
in the house tor a speech irom a star
like Hitler. it nonetheless is indicative
of their effectiveness at. raising
revenue.

“It you have thousands of people at
tending a rally and only paying a
nominal iee . . . you can see how they
made a lot of money." Pauley said.
“This was something new in German
politics. Previously German politicians
delivered lectures to inform the public.
The Nazis were not Concerned with in-
iorming."

The Nazi rallies were grand. gala
events. he said, The rallies featured
dramatic events like people
parachuting out oi planes and mar-

ching music, Illustrative oi the Nazi lnr
genuity was the Nuremberg Rally of
1934.

“Albert Speer got the idea to shineall
oi these powerful search lights 7 anti-
aircraft lights 7 thousands oi feet into
the air.” Pauley said “He called these
'pillars of ice.‘ " '

The Nazi rallies were especially suc
cessful in the rural areas ‘You can ims
'agine a small town with maybe one
movie theatre and a travelling road
show that came through once or twice a
month." he said. “[The Nazis] had
dances. movies. slide shows and violin

’ concerts. You can imagine the impact.

People were swept on their feet.”
Hitler was especially giited at ex-
citing masses at the rallies. Pauley sees
a lot of parallels between Hitler and the
iundamentaiist preachers oi today,
They use emotion in both cases and the
feelings oi sin and guilt, he said,

"They use a lot or the same techni~
ques, Both the iundamentalists and
Hitler will begin a speech by talking
about how awful things are.” he said.
"The fundamentalists talk about how
we are all going to hell and how awiui
things are, They raise the question as to
how we are going to endure this lwhich
makes the audience feel really
terriblel.

“Hitler would start by talking about
the Treaty of Versailles and how cruel
that was . . , how the Jews were destroys
ing Germany . , . how cruel the Allied
blockade was and how the Marxists
were destroying Germany,” Pauley
said. ”He would say that everything in
Germany was Just rotten Then. like the
tundamentalist. he would say. ‘But
there is hope} In the case of the fun-

damentalists it is Jesus Christ to end all .

oi this misery. In the case of Hitler it
was the Nazi Party."

To say that the German people are
more easily tooled . or suffer some
special character tiaw is wrong. he
said. “The German people were down
in the dumps and needed upliiting."

Pauley has found that there were
varying degrees of anti-Semitism in
Germany during the 1930s. Just
because one was a Nazi did not
necessarily mean that he Wished all
Jews to be killed.

“There were some antieSemites who
would choose not to have a Jew as a
friend. or would not join a club thathad
a Jew as a member,” he said. “Some
thought that Jews should not be allowed
to be civil servants or lawyers or doc-
tors. But it might be okay tor them to be
businessmen. they thought They [the
Jews] were good at that, But they
shouldn't be in a position iniluence the

clllldrcll ol Germany or Austria,

"Harsher anti-Semitics would say
that -ne've got to ship the Jews out. ,.
let‘s make liie so harsh here in Ger-
many that they will want to move
out.‘ " he said. "Just a fairly small
number said that Jews had to be
killed." . t

"In tact support tor the Nazi party
would have been seriously erroded had
the leaders came out early talking‘
about killing Jews," he said.

"One oi the insidious things aboutl
tliclonging to the Nazi Party Speer
'vi-ote. was that the party always tookI
things one step at a time." Pauley said.
"Once you got used to one hall‘sstep. the
party took the next hall~step." .

Hitler did the same thing in his
toreign policy. said Pauley. His early‘
loreign policy was very cautious. "His
lirst major ioreign policy step was to
conclude at treaty with the Vatican 7
now who's going to object with that)
The second major move was to con»
clude a nonsaggression pact with
Poland,

"How could any . even the mos
virulent antirNazi . . say that this wa
nicked?" he said. "In fact. the mos
lhardrcorel Nazis hated these move<
and thought that Hitler was losing hi
mind."

when Hitler began his hard-hitting
campaigns against the Jews. he really
n asli‘t doing anything thathad not been
already done to the Jews in prevmodern
history. Pauley said, For this reason
many oi the Jews chose to stay and en-
dui-c the short phenomenon oi Hitler's
cliancellorship.
