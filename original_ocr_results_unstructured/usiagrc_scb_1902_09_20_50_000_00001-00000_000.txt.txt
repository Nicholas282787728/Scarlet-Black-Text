THE RECEPTIONS.

Annual Functions oi the Christian As-
sociation are a Decided Successi

General Reception To-iiignt.

The annual receptions for the
new students were held yesterday
afternoon and evening. according
to the old custom at the begin-

young women’s reception at tour

o'clock was attended by an tiri-
As
they arrived at Institute hall they

usually large number oi girls

were received by Mrs. Bradley,
Miss Brace and Miss Charlotte
Davis. The usual conversation

and making new acquaintances

occupied the time dining the

altcrlloon, The girls have two

ideas which the boys might adopt

to good advantage. One is the

custom oi each old student bringr
ing and entertaining throughout
the reception a new one. In this
way the primary object ot the
receptions, to make the new stu-
dents acquainted with each other
and with the old, is better ac-
complished. The other the
labeling oi each person with her
own name, which greatly helps
the memory in retaining acquainte
ances.

The men'sreccption iii the even-
ing brought out a good number or
the boys ofthe college. After the
introductions and conversation be-
gan to lag. several short addresses
were given. Dean Main spoke
more especially to the Freshman
class, of which he'dcclaretl him-

paid a tribute to the college spirit.
Broi. Nollen emphasized the tact
thatin acollcge community every
one stands on his own merits, tine
aided or unhindered by iamily or
other connections. The college
community is a democracy in thc
fullest sense, and each isresponsi-
ble [or his own standing in it. Be
iorc breaking up, the boys ads
journed to the pleasant room of
the Chrestomathians, where light
refreshments were served. The
receptions were a decided success,
and it the weather does not intere
fere, the same will no doubt be
true of the general one this even-

cLassies IN ORATORY.

A step in advance along the
line of oratory and public speak-
ing has been made this year and
it is hoped that it will lead to
such an interest in this work as
will insure a chair oi oratory. For
years students and faculty have
recognized the need ol systematic
work in public speaking and the
ﬁrst steps have been taken tor
ward this end. Miss Glenna
Smith will have an elective class
in reading and expression ior
which one hour credit will be
given. This course is planned to
supplement the regular ‘work in
English. Besides this a class will
be organized for two hours work
a week in oratory and public
speaking. Already enough have
declared their intention of taking
the work to insure strong interest

in the classes,

DR. BEARDSHEAR.

The news of the death of Pres.
Beardshear,or1owa StatcCollege.
on August 5th last, came as a
shock to the ivhole state, and espe-
cially those interested in educa-
tion.

Dr. Beardsliear had gained a
reputation as one of the foremost
educators of the country, a fact
which was recognized in his elecr
tion as president of the National
Educational Association.

Dr. Beardshcar was not an old
man, but his career was strenuous.
He was hardly out of his twenties
when he was called from a pastor‘—
ate in Ohio to become president
of Western College at Toledo, Ia.
Within ten years he had taken two
more steps, going to Ames ircni
Des Monies, where he had been
superintendentotschoois. Intlic
eleven years of his administration
at Ames, he has lent an energy
and inﬂuence which has seemed
the embodiment of a new spirit
under which the college has made
rapid strides to the from.

Dr. Beardshear was a physical
and intellectual giant,ancl it was his
restless ambition which brought
about the nervous collapse.

Iowa College sympathizes with
Amcs in the loss oi her president,
and hopesthata man will be tound
strong enough to take his place.

 

FOOTBALL PROSPECT,

The Season Opens With Hair oi Last
Year's Team out of School.~
Alumni Gan-re this After-
noon.

Tile football season opened in
earnest when Coach Tratt arrived
A squad
came out for practice the ﬁrst of

on Thursday, small

the week and has gradually in-
creased to about thirty men.

Of last year's ’Varsity the center
and three of the back ﬁeld were
graduated while Moore at end,
Collins at tackle, and Dunn and
Handle at guard will be greatly
missed. Some of these positions
may be ﬁlled by old men who
were either substitutes or played
on the scrubs last year, but for
the most part we are dependent
on new men. The new material
is always uncertain to a great ex-
tent, for while they may or may
not have had experience elsee
where the mcthnd of coaching
and training is new and strange.

The new men are showing up
fairly well in the matter oi weight
so that a decrease is hardly ex-
pected. The average weight will
probably be about that oi last
year, a hundred and titty-ﬁve
pounds, which tells the old story
of Grinnell's ﬁght against odds in
weight.

The fact that we are almost the
last school in the state to begin,
Simpson, Drake and Ames, having
been open some weeks. combines
with the light weight of the team
to malte it more diﬂ‘icult to cope
willi other teams when superior
weight counts niorethan theteam
work we can put up so early in
the season.

Yesterday afternoon Mr. C. E.
Harris gave a talk to the squad on
the purpose of football and the
spirit they should show in training
and in actual contest.

The result at today's game will
have but little bearing on the
season's team as the men hardly
know the plays and formations
and nothing in the way oi team
work has yet been accomplished,

With such a hard schedule the
outlook is only hopeiul and no
correct opinion can be formed at
this time.
