To the Editor:

In the current issue of The New
Time there is an article with
common sense ways oi avoiding
narcs, informers, and other law
enforcement officers, At the end of
the article a post office box and

‘Ktelephone number are given where
anyone with information on in-
formers are encouraged to write or

,. call and relay this information to
The New Time. As I understand
this service, it would act as a
clearinghouse for information
pertaining to informers.

'1, This idea of a clearinghouse for
the identification and subsequent
exposition oi “undesirables”
reminds me of the MacCarthy Era
oi the fifties, During the McCarthy
Era, the “undesirables” were the
communists, and the
clearinghouse was McCarthy's
Senate Committee. Senator Mcs
Carthy ruined hundreds of people
by suggesting, often without

whether he honestly believed that
all of them were Communists, but
it is certain that he based many of
his conclusions on rumors Cir»

lhopelhisantirini‘ormcr network
being set up by The New Time does
not allow itself to be inﬂuenced by
rumors oi the type mentioned
above. While I am sure The New
Time will not falsely accuse
anyone deliberately, I urge them to
consider the personal
ramifications ifa person were to he
falsely accused oi being an ins

to carefully weigh all evidence
before making an accusation.

To the Editor:

Like Bob Render, whose letter
appeared in last week’s issue, I
have been disappointed in the
content oi the 5&8. However, ins
stead of, or in addition to,
editorializing on national and in-
ternational issues, I feel that
campus news could be greatly
expanded. Campus news has been
limited to summaries of events of
the past, announcements oi events
to come, and various opinions.

* The Who survives

by John Buckwalter

. As rock enters its second decade,
here are a handful of elite groups
who have survived since its
initiation. The Who is one of these
groups. They must face, along with
the other aged ensembles, a
common dilemma which says, how
does one grow old gracefully?

In the late ’60’s, the Who
acquired quite a large following as
the “maniacs of rock,” Their live
performances consisted of utter
chaos, drunkenness, smoke,

‘guitar-shattering, and drum-
Gnashing.

So, the appeal oi the Who has
always been its youthiul, “don’t
give a damn" attitude toward me.

‘lts songs seemed to detest old age,
.‘1 “My Generation," Daltry sang.

Hope I die before I get old,"

Today the ensemble suddenly
finds itself at the age oi thirt , no
longer members of the tee age
generation it worshipped. The
group members (and specifically
the chief songwriter, Pete
Townshend) are isolated from the

present due to age, yet they have
no desire to embrace middle-age.

The Who faces this quandry of
age directly in its recent album,
The who By Nuuihci-s. In one song,
Daltry sings,

Where do you fit in

magazines,

Where the past is the hero and

the present a queen?

Just tell me right now where do

you fit in,

with blood in your eye and a

passion for gin?
The entire album centers around
this theme; the idea of the
inevitability oi declining years is
repeatedly brought up in various
songs.

The music on The Who By
Numbers Seems to interrelate with
Townshend's thoughts The songs
on this album are more mature and
less reckless than some of the
earlier works, A listener will find
the recent album lacking the
cascading guitars and loud
defiance characteristic of such
songs as “Pinball Wizard” or

iipmn

“Won’t Get Fooled Again,” In
stead, age has mellowed and
pacified the group; this new
Collection of tunes Contains a
higher degree of introspection.

Although there are marked
drawbacks to this new at-
mosphere, The Who By Numbers is
in some ways superior to its
predecessors. Songs in By Num-
hers are much more harmonious
and distinct, and the theme is
direct, closely-knit, compact, and
extremely impressionistic to the
listener.

in The Who By Numbers, the
Who has perhaps done the only
legitimate thing it could; a Iacade
of artificial yoilthiulness would
certainly have broken down in the
presence oi any cynical listener,
and music of the '60’s generation
would have proven dull and ,un-
timely to the current buying
public. So, the group, which chose
somewhere in the middle, may
have Won what was needed for it~
an uneasy truce with lime.

hard to find out more than where

their aspirations are, and what
their attitudes toward Grinnell and

the past, professors have objected
to being evaluated by the num-

them, who can blame professors
for objecting to being treated

basis? There is a need for
