Turning to the sweet faced elderly
woman, who was looking with pride over his
shoulder at the picture of her boy, he said—
“Motller, these young people don’t appre-
ciate what a book like this means NOW, but
later on in life they will he more than glad
to have a reminder of their College days.”

All over the country during the summer
months, in large cities and small towns, in
villages and on the farm, proud parents will
be looking over the pages of College Annuals,
as in these books they will ﬁnd the only
real visualization of the College activities of
their sons and daughters.

Do you realize that your College Annual
is THE ONLY REAL PERMANENT REC-
ORD of your school years? Years later you
will prize it because of its sentimental and
intrinsic value, because it: will revive mem»

fore one realizes it. The friends that one
makes during these college days scatter to
the four Winds, each to play a prominent part;
in the grand scheme of things.”

What this educator has to say is ubso~
lutely true. The stately college halls, the
beautiful campus, the athletic ﬁelds with
their crowds of hurrying, enthusiastic stu—
dents, the Dorm Halls and Quad Cottages nll
fade away in years to come just like a mirage
in the desert. Only one thing remains, that
is your COLLEGE ANNUAL.

Your 1923 CYCLONE will be a Year Book
that will be radically different. New and
attractive features have been prepared that
will make it the best Annual ever published
in Grinnell. The art work will be superior
to anything that has appeared in the past in
the CYCLONE, the scene section will be a
rare treat.

There is to be only a limited number of
books obtainablei Don’t fail to order yours

paign ,sis afterthut time the chance to secure

Why Is Iron Magnetic?

But why?
We don't know exactly We Clo know that electricity and mag-
netlsm are related.

horse-slice magnet attracts a steel needle.

in dynamos and motors we apply electro~magnetic eﬂ’ectsi All our
power-stations, lighting systems, electric traction and motor drives,
even the ignition systems of our automobiles, depend upon thesc
magnetic effects which we use and Clo not understand.

 

Perhaps if we understood them we Could utilize til m much more
efﬁciently. Perhaps we could discover combinations ol’ metals more
magnetic than iron.

Tile Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company investi-
gate magnetism by trying to ﬁnd out more about electrons and their
arrangement in atoms.

X-rays have shown that; each iron atom consists of electrons grouped
around a central nucleusilike planets around an inﬁnitesimal sun.
X-rays enable us to some extent to see into the atom and may at last
reveal to us what; makes for magnetism.

This is research in pure science, and nothing else. Only thus can real
progress be made.

Studies of this kind are constantly resulting in minor improvements.
But some day a discovery may be made which will enable a metallur-
gidt to work out the formula for a magnetic alloy which has not yet been
cast, but which will surely have the properties required. Such a result
would be an achievement with tremendous possibilities. It would
improve all electric generators, motors, and magnetic devices.

in tllemeantime the continual improvement in electrical machinery
proceeds, in lesser steps. These summed up, constitute the phenom-
cnul progress experienced in the electrical art during the past twenty.
ﬁve years.
