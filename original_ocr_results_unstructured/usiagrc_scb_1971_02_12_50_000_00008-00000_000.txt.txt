M Basketball is in fullswing
with Clark Hall as the favor
ite, followed by Read andHal-
nes in the upper division. East
Norris, which got off to a
quick start with two exciting
victories, has fallen in defeat
after a star guard sprained
his ankle. The Cleveland* Lan-
gan team has dropped out of
the ArLeagne after forfeiting
their first game.

In the B- League, everything
is progressing well. Robins
son’s team is winning their
share and the girls' team is
losing theirs. The problem
seems to be that all the teams
are committingmore personal
fouls against the Bodquuad,
and the girls cannot seem to
convert the free throws. “lt‘s

Roundballers Finally Win!

Last weekend Grinnell's Pio-
neers went from miserable to
great in less then twenty- four
hours as they got bombed Off
the court 117*79 by St. Olaf,
only to upset Carleton Sature
day afternoon, 74-63.

The "game" against St. Olaf
was physically destructive
since the Pioneers lost the
services of Greg Beckman
for a considerable period when
he severely sprainedhisankle
in the second half. This game
was Grinnell's worst effort of
the season, even surpassing
their failure at Beloitthepre-
vious Weekend. Nosone was
moving, neither offense nor
defense. There was absolute-
ly no aggressiveness, except
on the part of Chuck Patter—
son, who canned 22 points, to
lead all scorers, and Quint
Phea, who fouled out in 10
minutes. The Oles laidapress
on Grinnell that destroyed our
Five because they just stood
around instead of moving the
ball. Grinnell's rebounding
was nonsexistent as nobody
felt like putting forth any 3f,
fort. Indeed, the outcome of
the game was so certain that
St. Olaf began substituting fr-
eely ﬁle. minutes into the

game. The Olesactedlike they
were just down for a practice
scrimmage, as everybody on
their bench had played by the
end of the first half, and this
free substitution was contin-
ued throughout the secondhalf.
Granted St. Olafisa good team
(they’re 10-0 and lead the
Conference), but there‘s still
no excuse for getting creams
ed by forty points by the Oles’
second and third strings. Th-
ere seemed to be a marked
lack of desire in this gme,
almost as though the Pioneers
didn‘t care whether they won
or lost. Along with Patterson,
who had the only decent effort
of the game, Bruce Bonnewell
scored 15 and Bob Burnett
scored 14 points. Dan l—lalors
son led St. Olaf wichl points,
Eric Bundgaard andDave Fin-
holt had 19and18, respective
1 .

the following afternoon pro
duced an entirely different
Grinnell basketball team. P1»
aying a tight defense and a
mediocre offense, the Pionr
eers trailed by only 6 at the
half. in the second half, the
Pioneers mounted a strong
offense and, combined witha
continued strong defense, blew

the game open and won easily,
74’63. Indeed, the Pioneers
were so aggressive that they
stunned Carleton with a 2378
blitz at the outset ofthe second
half that put the game out of
reach. The blitz was aided
immensely by 6 blocked shots
by Quint Phea, who finished
with 10, and 3 more by Bon*
newell. All in all, it was a
sparkling defensive effort and
a good offensive effort by the
Pioneers-egood enough topull
them out of the Conference
cellar. They even kept the
fouls reasonable, even though
Bonnewell, Greg Bombinski,
and John Otto all fouled out.
Again, "Pistol Pete" Patter’
son had a good game, getting,
16 points and 11 rebounds--
not bad for a guard from La
Canada(?), California. Bonne‘
well also had 16 and Bombs
inski and Phea had 12 and 10,
respectively. Carleton‘s Al~
exander led the scoring with
19.

Next weekend, Grinnell tra-
vels to Cornell to try to im-
prove their 2-7 Conference
record. Now that the Pioneers
have demonstrated how well
they can play, it is hoped that
they will continue to do so. If
they do, they still have a chs
ance at a reasonable Confer
ence record. If they can play
as well on the 13th as they did
on the 6th, the Pioneers should
come home riding the crest
of a two game winning streak.
