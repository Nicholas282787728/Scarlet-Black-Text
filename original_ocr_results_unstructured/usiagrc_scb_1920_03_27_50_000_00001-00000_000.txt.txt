Urges Students to
l Continue Education

“This is the critical time of your
life, when you are molding your in»
ture, Don't give rip your college edu-
cation,” was the advice given to the
undcrclassinen by Rev. Id. L. Haywood
in chapel Wednesday morning,

The strain of college life on one's
licnlth is mostly imaginary, he be
lieves, and lack of money can usually
be overcome through some means
Failure is a poor reason for leaving
school as per tent effort will get
the ave’ragc,person through. The
college-trained man wins out in the
long rim and it is hardly worth while
to leave school because one is anxious
to get to Work.

Cribbing Subject of
. Crosgrove In Chapel

. student control of cribbing and kind
tired dishonesty as it has been worked ‘

out at the University of Minnesota
was described in chapel Thursday
morning by L. M orosgrove, who was
formerly a member of the faculty of
that institution.

About four years ago. on request of
tile students the problem of cribbing
was turned over to the student coun-
cils of men and women as a tenta—
tivc plan. There was at. Lhis time a.
great deal of student sentiment

”against classroom dishonesty which
tended greatly toward the success of
such a plan. The facility was relieved
‘of the responsibility for detecting dis-

honest Work, this being observed by
the council members. All cases were
trim by the respective corrneils, right
of 3011651 to the dean being granted.

,Loss of credit, suspension and expulr
sion have been the chief punishments,

‘The system is still in operation and
