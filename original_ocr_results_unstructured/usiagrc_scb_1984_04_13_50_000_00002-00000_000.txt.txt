‘Date rape’

to

be addressed

by Scott Sutherland

Acquaintance rape. The term
itself and the questions it raises
are difficult and olten elusive,

Is it a question of physical
and/or mental coercion? Is it a
matter oi a stronger will imposing
itself forcibly and unjustly on a
weaker Will? Is it the causal result
of the man or woman having been
‘led on‘?’ is it the result of a lack of
communication between the man
and the woman?

Acquaintance rape. or 'date
rape' as it is often called. is. ac-
cording to the members of the ‘Ad
hoc Committee on Acquaintance
Rape Awareness,‘ a hidden pro-
blem at Grinnell. "in talking to
students, we found that a good
number of them had either eXr
perienced date rape or knew 50.
meone who had,“ said committee
member Paula Nixon

The purpose of the group. com»
prised of seven women and two
men. is to make students aware of
what committee members
perceive as a real concern. name:
ly the existence of acquaintance
rape.

To help illustrate its point. the
committee has scheduled two
presentations that will include
date rape dramatization and
discussion. The presentations wlll
be held April it at 9:30 pm. in
Main Lounge and April 23 at to

pm. in Langan Lounge. All are in»
vited to attend.

The committee members
stressed the fact that they are not
trying to offer solutions to the pres
blem. but rather are engaging
themselves in making students
aware oi the problem.

“It’s not our intention to point
fingers at men or anyone in
general,” said one committee
member,

The dramatizations and follow-
ingdiscussions will deal with such

matters as coercion, will. com-
munication, and the ways in
which acquaintance rape diners

Bannister on
sports

by isriaii Broderick and Lois Hal'-
risoii

Sir Roger Bannister. noted
British physician and the first
man otiicially to break the four
minute mile, received an
honorary doctor of science degree
in front of a large turnout in Dar-
by Gymnasium last Thursday.

Bannister received the degree
from Grinnell President George
Drake. who praised Bannister as
an example of "British toughness
and cii/ility." Drake recounted the
memories oi Bannister's record
breaking race oi 1954, stating that
it was a “watershed in the history
of sports .. Bannister then took the
podium and noted Grinnell's
reputation. especially that of
town Grinnell track standout.
Chris Chandler. Bannister
sprinkled his speech with jokes
and elaborated on the new turn
towards sports, especially those
toward the "formerly neglected”
groups of female and handicapped
athletes.

with the exception at Bob
Beamon's 1963 long jump record,
Bannister said. No records are
unbreakable today.

The use ofdrugs among athletes
was also touched upon by Ban-
nister. He attributed drug use to a
desire to overcome discomfort. an
important iactor in any athlete‘s
periormancc. Bannister labeled
drugs. especially steroids as a

Grinnellians inﬂuence
recent county convention

by Robert Valenti

Grinnell College students and
faculty played a key role in this
year’s Poweshlek County
Democratic convention held in
Malcom last Saturday, April 7,
comprising about one sixth of the
126 delegates and filling ads
ministrative positions.

Kevin Crim, director oi the col-
lege writing lab, was county
chairman and Mark Schumann. a
freshman. was chairman of the
Rules and Nominations commit-
tee.

The delegates, officials, and
guests spent five hours in the

, public auditorium of this small

Iowa town to decide on a
Democratic platiorm and elect
delegates to the District conven-
tion in Waterloo on May 5 and the
state convention June 9. The counr
ty convention is Iowa’s second
step in a hierarchy of meetings of
the party. starting with the Iowa
caucuses and proceeding to counr
ty. district. state, and national
conventions.

At the county level. as at the
caucuses. the “nonviable groups”
were the center oi attention. A
nonviable group is a group of
delegates supporting a candidate
with less than 15 percent Of all the
delegates. In this case, a.viable
group needed 19 delegates. If a
group is nonviable, its delegates
must realign with a “viable”
group or lose their right to send
delegates to district convention.

At the beinninng of the two
alignment periods. only the
groups supporting Walter Mon-
dale and Gary Hart were viable.
with 54 and 30 delegates, respec
tively, leaving George McGovern
with 14, Alan Cranston with 6i
Jesse Jackson with 5, and Uncom-
mitted with 17. The [act that
McGovern and Cranston are no
longer in the race did not dISa

quality their delegates, who were
free to switch to any viable group.

By the end of the ﬁrst hour of
realignment as of these delegates
formed a viable Uncommitted
group able to send six delegates to
Waterloo. dividing them three
ways between McGovern,
Jackson and those still “uncomr
milled.” Some justified this move
as a way to insure that delegates
sharing their views went on to fur
ther conventions.

A stir was caused when Kevin
Crim announced his own mistake
ot telling a delegate he could shlit
from one viable group to another
in the second realignment period.
Even though the shift was against
the guidelines set by the state
rules committee and would have
cost the losing group a delegate at
the district convention. Crim
strongly suggested that it be
upheld because the delegate had
been misinformed and might have
made his switch sooner had he not
been,

Mark Schumann appealed
Crim‘s suggestion. reemphasing
its clear violation of the rules. but
in doing so. was cut short when
Dave Mathias pointed out that
Schumann himself had exceeded
the one minute limit for appeals.

Crim‘s suggestion was approv-
ed by a majority of the delegates.
and in the final count of districts
state delegates. Mondale received
ten. Hart received seven and Una
committed received six.»0l' these
delegates. who were selected by
each group separately. iive Grin-
nell Students were chosen:iSteve
Berkson, Owen Charles. Ethan
Cohen and Alicia Elliott as Un~
committed delegates. and Raf
Stein as a Mondale delegate.

Marc Schumann, who was
selected as an alternate delegate.

the caucuses, plus amendments
presented that morning. Each of
the 42 ”planks", which set specific
posxtions on government, law.
economy, land, and politics, were
discussed and voted on, at times
with prolonged debate.

Regarding foreign policy. the
party passed a resolution oppos—
ing more aid to the ”repressive
governments" in Central
America, specifically addressing
the governments of El Salvador.
Guatemala and Honduras.

Mitch Harris. a junior, proposed
an amendment to substitute a
paragraph recognizing both Israel
and the right to a Palestinian na-
tional state to a ”support of the
Camp David accords of 1978". A
suggestion made by Bea Wall,
wife of Professor Emeritus Joe
Wall, that the two propsosals be
combined was eventually approvV
ed by the delegates.

Senior Anne Bordonaro's pro-
posal for a mandatory “national

and women from 1&21 to relieve

"national pride" was. after much
debate from college students and
others, first reworded to “volunr
tary” and then. after remarks
that voluntary service programs
already existed, was scratched
entirely. The process took about
is minutes.

A proposal by Mary Jane Cons-
tant to reword part of an anti
discrimination plank from ”alieCr
tional preference" to “sexual
orientation" was voted down
before she and other delegates
returned from lunch. Her
repeated motions to suspend the
rules to allow her to speak on
behalf of the amendment and
have a rervote were rejected.

A proposal by Owen Charles to
decriminalize and eventually
legalize possession oi mariiuana

the day. The vote iirst wen

characteristically. there was no
verbal opposition to the vote
before it was passed

There was also debate over
planks favoring gun control and
opposing capital punishment

Alter all the platform discus-
sions and realignment was com
pleted, taking about three hours in
all. a Montezuma delegate stood
up and said that it was too easy to
concentrate only on the politics
going on in the auditorum and ig-
nore the other issues. He said
“What we need to concentrate on
is being friends and defeatin_
Ronald Reagan and people like
him.”

This statement was applauded
and echoed by the several guests
who spoke at the convention; .ioe
Johnston, candidate tor a seat in
the House. Janet Carl. state
legislator. and Bob Anderson,
lieutenent governor of lowa. All
the guest stressed that the impor-
tance of the Democratic cause
and of beating Reagan surpassed
the causes of the individidual can-
dictates.

Anderson, who spoke the
longest. said that the Democrats
must work together to get the in
dependent votes, and warned
against a second Reagan term
saying, “if Ronald Reagan gets
elected again he will have the 01.17
porlunity of doing something
F D.R. Couldn't do, and that is to
pack the Supreme Court."
