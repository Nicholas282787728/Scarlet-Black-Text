Caution: classical music is whack

When attending the Florestan Trio a few weeks ago, it dawned
on me: modern classical conccirs suckl They are pompous opportu-
nities to take beautiful music and make it more horrid than a text»
book on the production or popsicle sticks. one without pictures or
scratchwiind—siiiiT stickcis.

Why do violinists always act as though their upper-halves are
those punching clowns rocking back and forth like something post
scsscd?1 know it’s supposed to make them look more “into the mus
sic"—and i understand that a little motion fur-h goo/l when plays
ing—hut honestly, it makes them look ridiculously like a char-med
snake.

Would you take a charmed snake set
riously? He lives in a basket. for Pete’s
sake. No other musician has those kinds
of orgasmic throes. Pianrsts can get a
little intense. but at least they usually
confine their movement to a back forth
motion. cellists usually do a simple
hcad noliibecmlst there isnt a lot you can do when theres a ccllo
between your legs except make obscene thrusts and tell girls, Come
over to my placc and 1 will play you like a cello,”

Violists, you will notice, hardly make any movement at all.Tliis
is because they know that et-eryene else knows that they can't acui-
ally play and that they wont be fooling anyone by “getting into the
music."

Even when I played viola,1 nrv r understood the whole swa l»
ingrmrtlicnnusic thingltthe pie is boring that you have to use
physical comedy to keep your audience entertained, why even bother
playing the symphony at all? Somehow 1 don't think the audience is
going to share your aural orgasm, although at concerts 1 have seen
people with their eyes hooded staring vacantly into space, with a
post coitai glow about them. or perhaps its iust the happiness of
completely zoning out.

People just take classical music too seriously these Clays.Arr:ncl-
ing a concert, you must sit stoicall t, not speak and never clap unless
you're supposed to. If you clap in between movements of a piece you
will be shunned tor the test otyeur life and permanently put on the
“do not serve"list at all orchestral hats.

What happened to the days when people used to dance to strings
rather thanjusr watch them? What happened to the era ofPrir/c (HI/l
Prejudice with live music and fancy dress parties and Colin Firth in

Molly Rideout'10
Death by Penknife

the bathtub? Classical mus so much more fun when we get to
show our emotions, an watch the musicians show thcirs.
That's audience participation, not some totalitarian regime, Clap
not now, not now, not now, new!

Ifyou look back to your childhood, you ll remember a time when
you danced atouud obi‘imiouslv next to your parents chairs during a
concert. Yes, we all did it. Then our parents would hush us and make
us sit still, and we would be borrm ri'r'i'l'e’l/ in a veryl loud voice. Yet
we learned to sit quietly, didn’t we? How? It's all thanks to the ad—
vances in modern brainwashing. see, the way coricei ts are designed
today, they always have some type of
refreshments at the end a pos ivc rciii-
i'oicement, a psychological tr k, Good
girl, you were silent during the entire
concert and never sneezed during the
quiet parts, l-lere, have a cookie. Jason,
what do you think you were doing?
You shufﬂed around so much that it
sounded likc the hall was under small arms ﬁre on the recording,
Ne roeti Xﬂl year

And you only get cookie at the very end, so you can't get a
toward it you cop out halfway. it doesn't matter ryorr stayed rot
scvcn»cighths or the concert and were really enjoying it. but had to
leave to take a call from your longrlost brother whom you haven't
heard from in’ten years Sorry, no punch or brownies rot )ou, but
good lrrck with that raniily thing.

Clas ’cal inirsicians just need to relax, let a little tension out of
their bows, and maybe t a pottery No more or this hoe

(I think it's a genetic mutation that's been developed over the years).
i need something to watch tinting a concert or something to do!
Pleasei Something more interesting than sitting, staring at a hunch
orci-aey punchingciowns. Because clowns ate creepy and the only
classical music I want to associate with them is the Pry/13: theme.

 

Thanks, in brief

I want to thank all of the Grinncll College students who sup
ported me in the Nov. 7 election for Poweshiek County supervisor.
I really appreciate all their hard work and the support they gave me.

I will do my best to serve veiyone to the best of my ability as your
County supervisor. Thanks, again!
iElli'e Sum/r

That’s diversity!

With the recent Democratic takeover of both the House and
Senate, I feel that the liberal and diversity-seeking students of
Grinnell need to unite in a iesponsc to change the colleges admis—
sions process

What I mean to say is this: we all like diversity and need to pres
serve it by taking a radical pos on with regard
to the composit otoui- student body, This is
simply a given—it is in out liberal blood. Divert
siry is the iieccss y destruction ofthe status quo
and the complacent conservatism that we feel
has no place in a pos structural woilti', in being
a true liberal, diversity should be the core lilofl’
ration of all our actions, As “being lib al" has
become more cliched among thoughtlc youth, we have lost our
essence, the courage to become diverse, in our need to congregate
as Democrats.

How can Grinncll become more diverse, you ask, in light orthe
recent Demociatic sweep oiboth the House and senate and in light
of the current trend among youth to simply appear liberal> The an-
swer is simple: to promote conservative values. Grinnell ncerls more
conservatives to become diverse, and riot in the sense of fulfilling a
quotaiin retins of empowering those to have differing opinions
from us.

WE MUST leave behind the complacent “lihci-al“ congicgation
otour student body’s past and advoc n Admission policy that
seeks moicthananythingtn increase div , tyon anipusbymaking
Grinnell an attractive place to study {or tic ultra-conservative clite

(OliSEIVUlll/f VII/HES

The answer is simple: to promote

flame Burkholder ’08

that we have come to hate. Is this such a contradiction? Be diverse,
further the debate!

Alum knows best

i enjoyed youi Grinnell College history quiz in the Nov. 10 issue.
it took me back to my childhood: [moved hcre at age foul, in 1956,
when my father joined the English and American Studies faculty.
Brit unless my memory is even worse than I think it’s gettingma
distinct possibility—one and a haltoryour answeis need correcting.

Qicstion #1 is the half: the eastern part ofwhat’s now called
Mac Field was indeed called Ward Field, when it had the football
stadium on it, The western halt, roughly the area south or cowles,
was always called M. -, or more i‘ortnally lVlacEacliron, Field, and
was always open as it ' iow.I can remember soccer (then an exotic
sport played only by international students) and held hockey being
played there from time to time.

The dividing line was a roadway that used to
run more or less where the sidewalk to the west
oftlic Campus Center new itiiisitlre large stone
market that's still there was in a sort oftraﬂic
clc. Ward Field track and football field ran n
and south (there was no PEC then; Ward Field
stadium was demolished to build it, ifnot before),
and there were concrete stands on the west srtle
ot’it, along the ioadway, which as l recall ran through to 10th where
I’ll" us now stands.

Even dimmer in my ineinoiy is the stable mentioned in Qics
tion #4—no doubt this is where Gary coopei s legendary (probabl)
apoctvphal) horse would have been bonded when he wasnt riding
it up Gates-Rawson Tower, When i was 4 or 5 my parents would
take me to ride, or more accurately sit on the back of, an extiemcly
leisurely old marc called Babe, I think.

It was actually on the other side of tlic tracks from the soccci
holds—roughly where the current tiacir is,witli a paddock iii the int
ﬁeld ofthc track and the stable itselfrunning along the train track
The road that still runs along the tracks was the access to the stables
and paddock
