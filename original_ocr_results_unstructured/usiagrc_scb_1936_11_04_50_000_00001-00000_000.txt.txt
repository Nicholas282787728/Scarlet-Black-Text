Pioneer Mentor Satisfied
Witl-l Team’s Play
Against Drake

(By Wells Barnett)

Well-satisfied with the Pioneers
play against Drake in the Home
coming game Saturday, Coach
Guy Lookahaugh Monday ordered
a rest for the first string in order
that he might concentrate his
attention on the second-stringers
this week. “Mel: who have seen
very much action will work only
two nights this week," he said.

Although he expressed regret
over the two costly slips which
gave Drake two touchdowns,
Lookahaugh declared himself
pleased with the general improve
ment in the team's play, particu-
lariy the blocking and tackling,
“I feel that the team we had on
the field Saturday is the best
to appear for us all year,” he
stated. ”They are definitely com-
ing along and improving with
every game."

Wet Field at Handicap

Lookahaugh hemoened the fact
that the wet field made it im-
possible for the Pioneers to pass.
“If we could have thrown the
hall a little, I think there would
have been a great difference in
the score,” he declared.

The fact that the Pioneer pass
defense was functioning in better
shape than at any time this year
also called for comment from the
coach.

Regulars Get a Best
While the regulars are laying

off this week, the men who have

not seen much action so far will

Tutor F rosh

Final Contest Scheduled
for November 21

The second and final game of
the freshman grid schedule will he
held with Iowa State Teachers col.
legc freshmen at Grinnell Satur—
day, November 21, according to
Coach John c. Truesdale.

In commenting upon the defeat
handed the Pioneer preps by the
Cornell yearlings last Saturday
morning, Truesdaie said poor exe-
cution of plays and weak blocking
and tackling were principal causes
for the 6-0 score, and these funds-
mentals will be emphasized in
practice sessions preceding the tilt
with the Tutor first year men.

The prep mentor stated that the
freshmen had not been thoroughly
groomed to beat Cornell, but added
that the team is composed of a
very promising group of gridders,
and that he expects to see much im-
provement in team play as a result
of future practices.

“We have one of the best fresh—
man teams in recent years. The
men know their assignments. plays
and signals, but the main thing
that must be emphasized now is
perfect execution," Coach Trues—
dale concluded.

Thieves Steal
Kelly, Langan

i Halls’ Radios

Machines Valued at $375
Taken from Dorms
Early Monday

Identity of the thieves who stole
two radios, valued at $375, from
the clubrooms of Rawson and
Langan halls early Monday morn-
ing remained undisclosed today,
as police authorities failed to lo-
cate the thieves.

The Rawson hall combination
radio»phonograph, valued at $275,
was purchased by the hall last
year. Langan's radio, bought
this fall, was valued at $100.
Neither of the machines was paid
for completely, or covered with
insurance.

Janitors Reporr Thefts

Theft of the two machines was
first discovered Monday morning
by the janitors, who paid no at-
tention to the absence of the
Rawson machine, but when, upon
entering the Langan clubroom.
found that machine missing, re-
ported the thefts. Police were
notified immediately, but inspec-
tion of the two clubrooms failed
to reveal any clues.

The thieves apparently drove a
large automobile upon the cam-
pus directly to the east of the
dorms and carried the radios from
the buildings to the waiting car
and escaped undetected.

Mrs. Martin Awakened

The noise of the departing car
as it drove north, just east of the
loggda awakened Mrs. F. L. Mar-
tin, Clark hall hostess. Although
she immediately looked out of the
window. she was able only to
glimpse the automobile as it dis-
appeared around the comer of
Dibble hall. ,

It is believed that the thieves
intended to fake the Smith radio,
for Mrs. Thomas M. Hodgens,
