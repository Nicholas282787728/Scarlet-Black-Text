New President sought

by Doug Schultz

A presidential search committee
is now in the process of seeking a
successor to President Glenn
Leggett, who submitted his
resignation to the Grinnell board of
Trustees early this summer.

Walter w. Straley, a member oi
the board, chairs the committee
comprised oi trustees, iaculty,
students and some alumni.

Resignation

With the college in a state oi
“strength and solvency,” Leggett
announced that he would resign as
soon as a successor is available
and not later than September 1,
1975.

On that date, he would have
served a decade in the post: a
decade in which liberalism and
radicalism at Grinnell, as at many
other institutions across the
country, consummated in the
turbulence of civil rights and
Vietnam.

Allegedly, the last few years oi
Leggett’s service have circled
back to the decline of liberalism
and a craze ior pre»Leggett
nostalgia.

During that time, according to
Grinnell College Board Chairman
Lawrence Keeney “the endowment
portfolio, now at $27 million, has
roughly tripled since 1965.”

A Grinnell alumnus, Straley is
currently vice president of cor-
porate communications ior John
Deere and Company. His search
committee breaks down into three
subcommittees: a trustee com-
mittee of six members, a laculty
committee of six, chaired by Ar-
nold Adelberg, and a student
committee of John Hansen, SGA
president, and vicerpresidents
Pete Reiner and Terry Yasdick.

Chosen by the iaculty, other
committeemen are: Luther
Erickson, James Kissane, Ronald
Kurz, Helen Shipley, and Don
Smith.

Hansen said that due to the
coniidentiality of proceedings,
student and iaculty membership
was kept to a reliable minimum,
Students were selected by Straley.

150 possible candidates, the
committee has eliminated most of
them in accordance with criteria
established by the committee.

Those criteria are l) successiul
administrative experience at an
academic institution, government
or charitable organization. 2) some
background in a small college,
whether as an administrator or as
a student. 3) scholarly experience,
preferably with a PhD. in an
academic discipline.

Adelberg explained that this
latter criterion was established
because a president should be an
“academic leader” and must deal
with the faculty frequently.

However, these criteria are
totally flexible, ii, for example, a
highly distinguished scholar with
only a promising future in ad-
ministration was considered.

The Grinnell

Candidates

The main concern, of course, is
in the best person. That, according
to both Adelberg and Hansen, is
one who is ﬂexible yet decisive,
who listens, appreciates and works
well with Students, faculty and
administration, as well as those
who raise money.

Adelberg stressed that the
committee is making extra efforts
to_ iind qualified women and
minority candidates, but with so
many other employers currently
doing so, they are iind to ﬁnd.

Recommendations

Sometime before October 15.
when the committee is scheduled
to make final recommendations,
some or all of the final candidates
will be invited to visit the campus
individually and interact with
students and faculty,

Hansen said that hopefully all
students will have a chance to meet
the candidates. Then they would

fill out a questionaire, the results of
which would comprise a student
final recommendation.

The iinal decision is still ten-
tatively scheduled for the iirst or
November, but that deadline will
most likely be postponed as the
screening process is still only hali
completed.

Gynecologist to aid Grinnell women

by Eva Hicrschbiel

Providing an alternative for
women who preier to see a
specialist is a major aim in the
establishment of a weekly
gynecological service at Grinnell
College.

“It’s not a value judgment,”
emphasized Diane Ruyttelaere,
Associate Dean of Students, at the
recent gynecological meeting, but
rather, she explained, “a hope that
women will start taking care oi
their bodies."

The Problem

Barbara Stevens who worked
hard last year for the establish-
ment of a program exclusively for
women added, “It’s really needed
here.” She pointed out that many
general practitioners in the town or
Grinnell handle women's
problems. “These women, as well
as the women on campus," she
stressed, “need a gynecologist."

The problem oi access to
gynecological .trealment was
brought to irma Hall, Director oi

the Health Service, in meetings
held at the end of last semester
which concerned expansion of the
Health Center‘s services. Hail
immediately took action.

Search
“Bringing a gynecologist to
Grinnell was a possibility,” related
Hall. “But there were problems in
that." Lack of space, equipment,

and funds were the major obs
stacles. A minimum salary for a

. gynecologist would cost $40,000,

while equipment might run more
than $10,000. In addition, the
Health Center could not ace
commodate an addition for the new
facilities without structural
change, ringing up an even greater
bill.

Finding a gynecologist who
would be willing to donate his time
for college women was an even
greater problem. Aiter calling
several gynecologists in the
Grinnell area, Dr. Paulina Fang
from Des Moines volunteered to
reserve his ,oiiice (or Grinnell
women every Wednesday ai-

ternoon irom two until three thirty.
. rong

Stevens described Fang as,
“simple and receptive. i felt very
comfortable with him.“ She added,
“Dr. Fang has worked with a lot of
younger people and was genuinely
interested in us."

As the program stands now,

women can sign up in the Health ’

Center for Wednesday ap-
pointments. Fang will be able to
see from six to eight patients
during the afternoon, depending
upon the type oi consultation
needed. Though patients will be
taken on a firstvtOVSign~uprfirstst0v
getsan-appointment basis, con
siderations will certainly be made
in the case oi emergencies Women
must pay their own bills, but there
is no transportation cost ior the
Station wagon which will take the
campus women to and from their
appointments.

Both Hall and Ruyffelaere admit
the program is not totally without
faults. But, encouraged Hall,
“Let’s give it a chance. Let’s think
positively about‘it."

The offer included a 281:th
acrosstherboard increase [or the
first year and a zscent increase
the second, plus additional con»
cessions.

The talk marked the ninth for-
mal negotiating session since the
July 25 walkout, A Monday night
meeting held by Neal and Phillips,
immediately iollowing the open
iorum in Herrick Chapel, also
proved unsuccessiul.

Ten students, concerned with the
lack oi iniormction concerning
strike demands, organized the
open community meeting in
Herrick Chapel. Approximately
500 people attended the Labor Day
session which lasted W2 hours.

Froi. Joseph Wall moderated the
open iorum which featured the
chiei negotiators from the labor
and management sides. Benjamin
Katz, a student organizer, opened
the meeting by stating diet “a
general state of ignorance" existed
on campus, and that the come
munity must be accurately in
formed to deal with the problem
eftectively.

Phiilips

P 'llips began his talk by
outl' ng the major events in the
negotiations. He Said that the
Second contract expired July 1,
1974, and that the union had
presented 39 items May 2i to be
considered in the upcoming con-
tract negotiations.

Phillips added that two sides had
met a total of 12 times since June
over demands in wages, health
insurance, longevity, vacation and
holidays. Meeting places have
ranged from Des Moines, Grinnell
and Newton.

To date, 15 issues have been
resolved, and 8 remain unsettled.
Current meetings are now being
held in conjunction with the iederal
mediator to speed up the set

tlement.
The college lawyer then

emumerated the various legal
rights oi the college and of the
workers during the strike period.

Phillips next dealt with the
major unresolved demands in the
labor dispute. He listed wages as
the top item, closely iollowed by
the cost-oi-living clause demanded

. by the union in all contract oiiers.

He stated that the college is of-
iering a 25 cent acrossrtherboard
increase the first year, and 24 cents
plus two fringe benefits the second.
The union is asking for 35 cents the
iirst year and so cents the iollowing
year, with a costoirliving proviso
for both years.

The union ls also asking for three
paid holidays, and me college has
responded with one. On increasing
vacation time, the college has
proposed an additional day of
vacation after lo years, whereas
the union wants the schedule to
start aiter 5 years.

Paul Neal

Neal basically colliirmed the list
oi demands as outlined by Phillips,
emphasizing that “what we're
asking ior is bread and butter
items.”

He added that the iirst union
contract Went ”pretty smooth” and
that the second contract was
signed without a strike, The third
contract remains to be agreed
upon, pending agreement on what
constitutes “a [air living wage."

Questions were then fielded from
the audience. in answering the
queries, Neal and Phillips differed
on statistics which were used to
support the proposals irom both
sides.

Dean Waldo Walker did state
that ii the increase in wages of-
fered b0 BStG workers were to be
directly reflected onto student
tuition rates the increase per
student would be $50.96. He added
that B&G salaries currently
represent one-twelfth oi the college _
budget.
