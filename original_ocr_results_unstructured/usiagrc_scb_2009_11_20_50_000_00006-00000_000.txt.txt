Baking in the buff

by Tyler Banas

When I risked for directions to Eco House last Sunday.l was
told that it is the home with the “bushy patch" of prairie grass in
frontinn ironically appropriate description for a house hosting
a nude baking event.

lwas immediately greeted by skm and smiles when i entered
the kitchen The hosts gave me freedom to undress to whatew
er degree of nudity I felt comfortable with. so the pants came
off, However, there were unfamiliar faces—arid nipples—in the
room, so I decided to leave my skimpies on for the time being.

Two desserts were on the menuvcarrot cake cupcakes and
chocolaterCraisin cookies. The small kitchen, in my opinion,
provided an exceptional facility for nude baking. The very putt
pose of nude events is to share your bodilyridentity with 0th
ers—wriggling between racks and brushing against checks while
fetching the brown sugar definitcly fosters such intimacy Notk
cooking aprons cover only the front of the bodyl

Any apprehension I initially harbored passed through my
lnlnd as we prepared the food, and was soon replaced by a liber-
ating freedom. Several more participants arrived, totaling about
10 peopleisome nude, some not.

Several people noted that the house was too cold and a nude
baking event justified the environmental expense of turning up
the heat. Eco House residents, however, demonstrated their vale
iies by utilizing an alternative heat source—when the snacks were
done baking the oven door was left open, which increased room
temperature by several degrees.

Despite the foretelling directions I was given, no bush was
exposed. In retrospect,l wish I would have gone fully nude~but
I didn't want to be the only one. I asked for an apron but there
were no extras. At Eco House's next nude halting eventmwhich
they do plan on hosting—l will be sure to bring my own and
undress.

I arrived at the mﬂk’ldenllﬂtd masturbation workshop
slightly tardy to a circle of males sharing their names and the
oddest place they had pleasured themselves.

A pickaxe of an icehreaker, the awkward silence caused by
the topic of self-pleasure quickly turned to frequent laughs as
everyone realized masturbation is one ofthe most relatable eXr
periences for males.

l felt comfortable. I wanted to share my experiences, from
how 1 aecidently discovered the habit at a very young age to an
awkward moment m my adolescence when my mother walked in
on me in our living room at midday and began scolding me for
my choice ofvenue, only to later praise me for exploring my body.

Then, the conversation swiftly switched from selfrpleasuring
to erotic inspiration to partner sex to gender issues. In the process
I was left feeling entirely uncomfortable as rather naive com,
ments were made regarding how sex should be, and how main-
stream porn is a model ofwhat sex should be. Some individuals
even admitted to not knowing that males can achieve orgasm
through stimulation of both the penis and the prostate.

After this subsided, a solid ﬂow ofinformiltlon began and I
realized the exact reasoning for the workshop—advanced sexual
education, the stuff most peoples’ parents did not teach them. but
they instead find out on their own eventually. It became evident
thatjust because I know some of the things that please me sexu»
ally,l cannot assume to know about the sexual desires of anothert

Initially, there was a clear mix ofhesltation and curiositywhen
the concept of prostate stimulation was raised. The reluctance
to experiment may stem from a preconceived notion that men
are not meant to be penetrated. Yet, luckily there were plenty of
people who shared their experience and knowled iagrams
included. This helped dispel some of the homophobic anxieties
present in the room. Most guys who have been informed of the
prostate’s power have considered experimenting with it, and the
positive feedback provided at this workshop surely only encour-
aged thar exploration.

The mood lightened near the end of the workshop as attends
ees shared their most humorous masturbatory episode. The ions
get the forum ran, the more I appreciated that itwas expanding
my understanding ofboth gender and sexuality. So often, 1 think
of sex far too simply, and that seemed to be a common mind-
setiyou get aroused, you mastuibate, you move about your day.

However,just because an efficient orgasm is so easy to dis-
cover for most men, we neglect to think of more elaborate possir
bilitics.Tlle masturbation workshop served as a perfect reminder
that one's sexual knowledge and exploration are never complete

MARI’A PROKIIOROVA

De-stigmatizing abortion, redefining fat

by Katherine Chung

Film Screening and discussion,
”I Had an Abortion”

As I looked around the room at the students gathered for
the film screening of “I Had an Abortion," directed by Gil~
liarl Aldrich, and a discussion led by Professor Astrid Henry,
Gendn ocWomen's Studies,I was pleasantly surprised to see
that about a third of the attendees
were made, since abortion is widely
considered a “women’s issue."

I appreciated the film's chron-
ologieal organization of abortion
stories and the diversity of the ins
terviewees' experiences and backgrounds.

While every story did have a happy
ending, the happy endings often came
at a high cost—both literally and ﬁgu-
ratively. My heart broke as 1 watched
woman after woman confess her
stniggle to find a clinic, afford the
cost of the procedure and deal with
feelings of shame and guiltAmany
times all by herself.

The discussion following the film re»
volved around a number of topics, includ-
ing the stigma that accompanies abor-
tion and can cause the woman to feel
as if she's “messed up" and somehow
deserves to suffer the consequences for
her “promiscuity.” It seems that society
points fingers and whispers about women
who get abortions—even those who claim to be pro-choice.

As we grappled to rationalize the stigma, my mind kept
returning to the end of the ftlin, when the women featured
challenged others to speak out about their abortion experi-
ences. It came to me that these women are revolutionaries—
confiding in us Ll'lclr most private moments so that abortion
no longer has to be a private matterThougli it may take some
time before all women can feel comfortable sharing their
abortion experiences,1 think the night was a solid start.

Fat Acceptance Discussion
1 arrived at Younker Lounge to partake in the Fat Aethr

LOVE YOUR BODY

ism workshop. admittedly with a certain amount of uncer-
tainty and skepticism about the event. I had seen the posters
around campus announcing “Fat does not equal unhealthy"
and featuring pictures of“plus size" women, but was not well
informed about fat acceptancehthe topic of conversation for
the night.
The student—facilitated workshop was much like a
classroom discussion, with a circle
of couches organized around a
small table. I was surprised to
hear several of the facilitators call
themselves for. when they looked
like a “normal”weiglit [0 me.
In my dictionary, far has only ever
served two purposes—selfdeprccation
and ridicule. Wouldn’t euphemisms like
“curvy," “voluptuous" or “bigboned” be
more appropriate? Later the facilitators
explained that the word fat is not in its
self a bad word, but that society has at
tached negative connotations to it
one of the participants brought up
the point that fat women are consid-
ered more beautiful than skinny women
in many other cultures. But if I ever used
the word fat as a complimentithink,
“Hey Eriendo, you look really far [0*
dayl”—the recipient would most
likely be offended and stomp away.
Then there‘s also the question of
using words like “thin" or “skinny" as a
compliment, How many times have you heard or said, “You
look really greatehave you lost weight?” Could praising thin-
ness be just as problematic in the movement for fat acceptance
as shaming fat?

In retrospect, I think we’re all too scared to talk about fat.
We hide from it, we ridicule it, we invent myths about it, but
rarely do we talk openly about it. I will admit that I was un-
comfortable iind diseoncerted for parts of the workshop. But
I think in order to restore the reputation of fat we have to
make ourselves vulnerable and willing to engage in an honest
dialogrc.
