A story worth the effort

I’mtrmxl has been a huge endeavor for
east and crew. “it takes a village to perform
and produce this show," said director lesley
Delmenrco,Theatre. with about 70 people
working on the set and more than 20 cast
members, the production reflects the com.
plexities of plot and meaning in the play's
script. The show begins, Delmcnioo said,
as an "art history mystery." Ser in an aria
eient church in an unspecified Eastern Erie
ropean country three art historians gather
to debate the importance ofa fresco similar
to Giotto’s Lamml/Itiwl ofC/m'rt.

While th: critics debate the valu: ofthe

Mar. The other is here."

Communication barriers
spoken and non-verbal communica.

rector Rachel Haile '04 struggled with the
language issue. “We had to work out a lane

One world under Pentecost

Actors prepare for an emotionally-heavy production that brings together a multiplicity of cultures and languges

mutations it's gone through." Resident set
and lighting designer Pip cordon, Theatre,
has produced a realistic church interior in
the Flanagan Theatre with the help ofstu.
dents from stagecrarr 101 ,Theater 100 and
the student production start.

in addition to the atmosphere the set
provides for the actors, the audience will
actually be inside thischurch, sitting in tarp.
covered pews or at the foot orthe altar that
functions as astage. “The relationship with
the audience will be different because a lot
or times wc'rc acting in the aisles or on scaf.
iolding ten feet in the air, “ said Mark
Gardiner '05, who plays art historian Oliver
Davenport. Delrncnicosaid, “The relation.
ship between the actors and the audience is
so intimate that there is no possible way to
distance yourselffronr the action.”

Cultural crossroads

The actors' reactions to the process of
dorcloping this play have beenstrong. Neha
Govil '07 plays Yasmin. a Palestinian who
leads the group of refugees because she an
speak English. she has trained the challenge
oiplaying a refugee, an experience far re.
moved from her own, “Most people at
Grinnell are fairly sheltered," she said. “We
go around prototrng about things like this,
but we have no idea what these people re»
ally go through."

The actors hope that the play wrll have
the same effect on the audience that it has
had on them. Pcnrrcrrr couples
sociopolitical themes with scenes that are
emotionally and physicallyvisceral. “Thor:
are parrs orthe play thatstill bring tears to
our eyes," said Gardiner. “Ifwe’ve heard it
that many times and it still moves us. per»
haps it will have a similar effect on the au»
clience."

The fresco at the ocntetofthe altar, and
at the crux of the play, depicts the Lamene
ration of Jesus. The biblical Tower of Bar
bel, mentioned in the play, was a place
where barriers of language and desires for
power divided the world completely. The
Christian feast of Pentecost, for which the
play ls named, was a time when speaking
in tongues brought people together.
Delmcnico believes that the play evokes
both cmss«clllturdl and multilingual inter.
action: the “cultural myths that say the same
things to different people." as well as the
diffeiences that can rip them apart. “The
play offers no easy platitudes or answers,"
she said. “This play is something to ab.
sorb, chew on, fight with and examine.”

Dan Brown’s TheDc Vinci Code is probably the most
intriguing book l’ve ever read. it could be argued that this
means i haven't rmd very many books, but I‘d disagree.

I checked the book outofstcwart Library and ﬁnished
it during my oneweck allotment, but i was reluctant to
give it back. sol boughr a copy of my own in lowa City. I
dont buy a great number ofbooks. mainly because i iust
don't think most books need to be read more than once.

TluDa Vma Code, in my mind. is an exception—in a
manner ofspciking. I dont think the book necessarily needs
to be road again as much as it needs to be perused, Some
crlrin may celebrate dac novel's literary merit, but on the
contrary, 1 round Browns style ofwriting to be dilnred and
nothing too special. in particular, the budding romance
between protagonist/Harvard symbologisrRDbert iangdon
and French cryptographer Sophie Neveu seems overly
cheesy and contrived.

The premise of Theorr vino Code leads Langdon and

Neveu on a wild.gootc chase sort ortreasure hunt to track
down clues left by Nevcu’s murdered grandfacher, Jacques
saunierc. who was also the curator ofthe louvre. sauniere
was a da Vinci aficionado, and many of the clues in the
book stem from symbols in the famous painter-s works. in
fact, pan ofthe reason saunierewas murdered wasbecausc
he served as Grand Master of the Priory ofSion, a secret
society which actually exists and whose past Grand Mas.
tcrs have included daVinci himself. Members ofthe Priory
claim to know the oract location ofthe Holy Grail, and
Langdon and chcu's subsequent hunt for whatever
Saunicro has lair for them is filled with expertly crafted
suspense and a more interesting idea or theory around ev.
ery corner.

The reason I bought the book is for its subj:ct mat.
[er—I've never been so fascinated as l was when Brown
laid out, piece by piece, the evidence for rhe theory that
lens was a mortal man with awire, Mary Magdalene. and
a child, whose descendancs (or so the novel claims) survive
to this day. The book goes even rurrher to suggest that the
Holy Grail is not a chalice but Mary Magdalene herself,
who held the bloodline oth-sus Christ. According to The

De wrin- Cor/r, top—tanking members orihe Priory of5ion
are the key to exposing the proposed truth about the Grail
and the life of Jesus Christ.

it was enough to make me want to take a history class.

So while i don't think Brown's fourth novel lives up to
the hype it's received in a technical or literary sense, 1 do
think that Thr Dr Vinci Cadzdeservcs that covered spot it's
held for so long at the top of the bcsoeller lists. The nu-
merous, short chapters make it fastpaccd and easy to read.
and die characters are likable enough. especially wisecrack.
ing old British historian Leigh Teabing, who actually had
me laughing out loud at some points. And rhe novel is
really quite intelligent—while there were some “surprises"
that 1' could see coming from a mile away, the maroriry of
plot twiso and turns that Brown devises show a real sense
of cleverness and cunning.

Though The Da Vinci Cot/4 is. obviously, a work of
fiction, and though much ofthe supporting evidence for
the previously mentioned theory is a link sketchy, its bril.
liantly done for a popular novel, andl think it deserves all
of the praise and accolades it has earned thus rar.
