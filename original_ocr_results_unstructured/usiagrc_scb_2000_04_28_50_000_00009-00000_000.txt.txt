Pope John Paul II

I wish in respond ro Jim
Dinnerville’s commenrs regarding
my April 14 column, Firsr, I
would like ro make irclcar rhar rhe
inrenrion or my column abour
John Paul II was nor in blasr rhe
Carholic church, bur ro poinr our

nihcanr in lighr of Carholicism’s
past.

Mr. Dinncrwlie’s ﬁrst criiique
was that John Paul II has aered in
accord wiih rradirional carholic
moraliry and has nor succumbed
in “modern liberalism" as l suggesr.
To rhis I would argue rhar while
much ofcaiholic dogma has om
cially remained consranr for ccn-
ruries, rbe scope, meaning, and
praerice of Carholic docrriiie has
undeniably changed rhrough rein.
rerprorarion and alrered emphases.
ln supporr of rhis claim, I offer
rhree quesriuns: i-lavc John I>aul
11's charirable and reconciliarory
aerions come from rhe same unr
dersranding or “an ancienr, con—
servarive moraliry" as rhar which
spawned rhe Holy Crusades, rlie
Inquisiiion, and rlie idea oi puri.
ﬁcarion rlirough ﬁre? I rhink nor.
Is John Paul a liberal? Nor in rlie
same sense as rhe rcrm is com.
monly mcanr, nor do I claim oil-i»

erwisc, Have some praceices and
reachings orrhe Carholic church
been liberalized during his papal
reign? Yes, in very rangible ways,

As for rhe role othe Church in
WWII. I srand by my posirion diar
pope Plus XII (who is now being
canonized) and many Varican orn—
cials were drawn inro compliciry
wim Hirler's racisr and anri-Scmiric
governmenr rhrough rheir inacrion.
Even afrer mulriple arremprs by rhe
Allies urging Pius XII ro condemn
rhe Nazi persecurion ofthc Jews, he
renised ro do 50, Though he spoke
our againsr rhe rragcdies incurred
during WWII, Pius was more cone
eeriicd wirh rhe mainicnance orhis
Church as a ccnrralized, monolidaic
religious insrirurioii rhan exploring
acrions char would signiﬁcantly help
rhe Jewish people,

Furrhermore, as early as 1933
Pius XII agreed ro sray our ofinrere
nal German polirics in exchange {or
she nascenr Nazi parry's prorecrion
of carholicism in Germany, Iarer
in rhe war he also bargained wiih
ihe Nazis io exempt carliolics of
Jewish ancesrry from die yellow Srar
and persecurion while only indirchly
assisring Jewish people rhrough inc
creased chariries and facilirared cmie
grarion From Nazi rcrrirory. As Js,
Mill srared in on Libcrg, “a person

may cause evil ro ushers nor only by
his acrions bur by his inacrion, and
in eidier case he is jusdy account»
able ro mom."

I do nor blame Pius XII for drie
Holocausr, bur I find die evidence
ofhis sranee on die murder of mil.
lions of Jews eo be eirrremcly amr
biguous ar besr. As l—Iirler enacrcd
his Final Solurion ro rbe “Jewish
problem," Pius XII was largely sic
lenr in condemning rlac Nazis and
acrually played down she number of
Jews being brurally murdered. As
Piano's D’Arcy Osborn, die Brirish
Minisrer ro Lhe Holy See, pur ir, pius
XII clung ro neurraliry “even in rhe

In lighr ofrh: above eioalirauons

A discussion of flag censorship

By Dan Rothschild
Staff Columnist

”[The Confederate Flag]
should have no social status
whatsoever."

-Rev. Jesse Jackson

Ir looks as if ihe conrcderare Stars
and Bars may nor ﬂy above rhe Souih
Carolina siarehouse much longer. Af»
rer all, rens of rhousands of “activists"
have called for iis removal, including
such usually apollrical, eenrrisr ﬁgures
as rhe aforemenrioned Reverend lacka
son. lrs criries say rhar rhe ﬂag repre.
senrs slavery, oppression, and racial
harred because rhese rbings were car.
ried our under irs warchful eye. How»
ever, when we consider rhe logic orrhe
rhis cririclsm, rhere won'r be a ﬂag ro
wave bur rlie whire ﬂag orsurrender io
pulirical correcrncss.

The issue came ro rhc arrenrion or
rhe popular press earlier rhis year when
corpresidenrialcandidaresoeorgew.
Bush and John Mccain were asked
rheir opinions or wherher rhe flag
should be kepr above rhe srareliouse.
Bush said rhar rhe decision should be
made by rhe people oisourli Carolina;

ror ibis, he drew endless criricism for
pandering. However, whar he said was
rhe righr answer. Washingron has ab-
solurely no business rolling rhe people
or Sourh Carolina wliai Hag rhey may
fly over rheir srarehouse. In our reder.
alisr sysrem or governmenr, a sysrem
rhar rbc hair and righr are equally iond
oi ignoring, srare issues are conirolled
by rhe srares (wirness rheTenrh Amend—
mcnr ro rhe Consriturion) Ar no rime
in Professor srrauber's Consrirurional
Law course do I remember learning
abour a coiisrirurional clause giving rbe
power oisrare ﬂag design so Congress.
For all Congress should care, Sourh
Carolina could fly a McDonaldx’s nag
abour irs srareliouse. Ir is simply nor a
decision for a 11.5. presidenr ro make.

Cerrainly, rlie Srars and Bars was rhe
flag which new over rlie Confederacy
during rhe war berween rhc srares. Bur
ir should nor be iorgorren rhar slavery.
oppression, and racial barred were hope
pening in rhe Unircd srares iiiiril rhe
same rime. As we all learned in elemcnr
rary school, rhe slaves were nor rreed
uniil January land, and rhe Emaiici.
parioii proclainarion did nor apply io
unionisr slave srares. Thar is, blacks
were freed in rlie Confederacy by rhe
acr ora union governmenr, bur blacks
in border srares which sided wirh rhe

Union were kepi in bondage unril rhe
13'I-Ameiidmenr was passed. -

so by rlie Jesse Jackson srandard, any
Ilag under which slavery and oppression
occurred should be banned. I’m sure
rhar rhe descendanrs blacks kcpr en.
slaved for 90 years under rhe American
ﬂag (and for 250 years before rhar un»
der rlie Brirish Union Jack) will be glad
ro know rhar Mr. Jackson niusi wane
rhe American nag ro come down as
well. The descendanrs orNarive Ameri.
cans killed offundcr rhe genocidal pmr
grams niPnrrugal and Spain will be glad
ro see more ﬂags eradicared. Tor rhar

maricr, rhc Narivc American children

mken ii-oin rheir homes so years ago ro
be “civilized" will be glad so see rhe
us. nag banned, as will rhe Asian—
Americans pur inro “internment"
camps when my grandparenrs were my
age. The Chinese bi-oughr ro America
ro build rhe railroads would be glad ro
know rhar, as a ﬂag which once rcprer
sensed enslavemenr oiAsiaii peoples.
rlie us. ﬂag will be coming down. The
lisr or wrongs cunimiircd under rlie
Srars and srripes conrinues adheriieiim.

so when you ger righr down ro ii,
rhore's nor much of any ilag rhar any-
body will be able io Ily anymore, Arrer
all, almosr every counrry has irs bad
spors we’ve all made misrakes in rho

pasr. The dirrerence is rhar rhe Cone
federacy liad irs hisrory books wrirren
by rhe victors who have wrongly de.
clared rhar rhe Civil War was iusr abour
slavery. And because ofirs dearb 135
years ago rhis monih, rhe confederare
Srares oiAmerica never had a chance
ro move beyond irs hideously cruel in-
srirurions ofslavery and oppression.

So rake iriro eonsiderarion where rhe
Unired srares was in 1865. and Judge
rlie counrry by rbar srandard and char
srandard alone. The srars and Bars rep.
resenrs many rhings ro many different
people, And ro many Sourherncrs, ir
represenrs a umquc way of modern life
rhar is rnosr cerrainly nor based on ha.
rred and slavery.

Please, Mr. Jackson and orhers who
are bemoaning rlie ﬂying or rhe Srars
and Bars; rake a srep back and see whar
you’re proresring. To you he a symbol
of slavery. But ro many people across
rhe world, rbe us. ﬂag is a symbol of
imperialism, war. and genocide. should
our narional nag be banned because our
couiirry has made misrakes in rhc pasrz
Cerrainly nor. I only wish rhar rhe same
courresy could be given ro rhe ﬂag or a
iiaiion, now deceased, whose memory
lives on in rhe beans and minds of
many upcnrmindcd and non.racisr
sourherners,
