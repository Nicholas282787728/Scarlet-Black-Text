nines of praise and criticism. Regard~
less or the merits or the play itself,
it is signiﬁcant to note that the Devei'-
eux players were able to present it in
a manner that won the complete ap-
proval or the audience. Choosing tor
himself, out oi the diverse threads or
this play a theme or his own Clitrord
Devereux succeeded in creating a deﬁ-
nite atmosphere in the minds of his
audience,

“Arms And the Man” Ilring Applnuse.

“Arms And the Man” can only be
called a Shawism, meaning by that
term all the romantic, satirical and
theatrical effects so prominent in the
works of the English writer. Panto-
mime acting occupies in this play a
part of extreme importance, for it is
by silent acting that much of the at-
mosphere is created.

That "The Arms and the Man" car-
ried the audience with ﬁrmer interest
and with more applause than the other
plays is a tribute, not alone to the play
itself, but to the incomparable manner
in which it was presented.

Bevel-aux and Grill Commended.

In all the productions, the work of
Cluford Devereux and his leading lady,
Miss Zinita first is especially to be
commended. or the other actors, Ede
