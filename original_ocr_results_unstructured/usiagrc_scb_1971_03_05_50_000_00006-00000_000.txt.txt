Rosemary Ash Reviews RA Job

by Barb Rabyne

"The role of an Rnisa coma
plex one. I function as a coun»
selor in the residence hall,as
a facilitator, and sometimes
as a coordinator of activities
in the hall. lalsofunction out
side of the hall," says Rose?
mary Ash, RA for Main and
Mears Halls. “1 expected itto
be a job with few administra-
tive duties, one in which I
would have a lot of contact
with students,andan open end
ed job where I could do work
outside of the residence halls
ifl chose to do so.

Rosemary received a BA in
history from Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis and an
MA in Student Personnel Ad
ministration from Teachers
College, Columbia University
in New York. "After having
lived all of my life in big cits
ies, I wanted to try a small
town. I find it refreshing tobe
in Grinnell. I enjoy the exper-
ienee of being at a small lib-
eral arts college, and the free

dom on campus. However, the
isolation of Grinnell at times
can be frustrating for the staff
as well as the students."

“My favorite aspect of the
RA job is working with the

' students in my halls on an in-

dividual basis. My most im-
portant function is tobeavail-
able for whatever comes up.
It is helpful, and'veryimporr
ant, for an RA to wander thr-
ough the halls, seeking out
students as well as waitingfor
them to seek her out.'Ihc best
way to meet students is just
to make oneself available in
the hall. The longer an RA is
on campus the more effective
he can become. It helps to
have experience.”

Besides Rosemary's activi-
ties in the dorm, she helped
Prudence Milite, Steve Mohr
and Dean Hinds for a while in
the Placement Office. At the
beginning of the year she
worked as a coleaderwith Bill
Abdallah and Don Bouwens in
freshmen groups. She is also

involved in the RevolvingDoor
as a member of the selection
committee andasa stafftrain-
er.

"There is a lot of counseling
on this campus in many dif-
ferent places. The most im*
portant thing is to coordinate
all the services. At times it
would be helpful for the RAs
to work more as aunit. Somea
how, the fact should be publi-
cized that students can go to
any RA. on campus. If more
students took advantage of
this, it would be helpful to
students and RAs."

How does Rosemary view the
coed dorms? "I‘m glad that
there are going to be more
coed dorms next year. How-
ever, I think there should al-
ways be the choice ofa variety
of arrangements. "

Rosemary's plans for the fur
ure are not definite. "I‘d like
to continue working Wilhstudr
ents, on an individual basis,
perhaps in a Dean of Students
Office.

Duvls‘ons Caught In Uganda Coup

(continued from page 5)

Armin has definitely set a tone
of clemency by not detaining
the former cabinet members.
We are under a curfew, and
political activity is banned,
but otherwise life goes on as
usual. Qir doctor friends re-
port that the Govn't hospital
was jammed last week with
casualties, but that they were
mainly victims ofcelebration,
having fallen off cars, into
fires (many goats were killed
and toasted) or been run down
by vehicles. The medical stu-
dents got some good practice
stitching them up, , y,

On/ ,Wed. the 9' U‘p.m.‘ news
announced that the Kabaka's‘
body (former Baganda king
who died in exile in London
last year) would be brought
back for burial with honors

. here. Again, that disembodied
roar of thousands of voices
rose from every hill and val— >
ley, punctuated by shrill ulur
latlon and throbbing drums.
Che could not help being stir-
red by the intensity of local
feeling and also relieved that
it arose out of joy and not
anger.

So many things remain to be
seen. Parliament has been
dissolved, district and munir
cipal councils dismissed. Un-
til elections government will
be by exec. decree. A new ca-
binet has been named, some
of them moving up from per-
manent secretary positions
which should help stabilize
affairs. Ihave neither the in-
formation, perspective, or
disposition to comment fur-
ther.

Jack should be able to con-
tinue his research as the re
cently won (long awaited) lets
ter of consent was written by
a then permanent secretary
who is now Minister of Fin-
ance.

All the shooting is net yet
over and yesterday I was asked
to move my car out of the line
of fire from an adjacent hill
as I waited to pick up my
seven school car pool child-
ren. A friend was almOSICSU’

the school from the rear, cr-
eeping through the grass to
where the nursery school ch'
ildren lay on the ﬂoor ofthelr
school room and rescuing his
charge out the back door.
Nakasero Hill school children
did not return after lunch, but
our children, schooled on dif~
ferent hills went back as us-
ual. It seems easy to “carry
on" as we do not fear the
Army. A year ago after the
attempt on Pres. ObOte’s life,
soldiers beat many Europeans
caught by their road blocks
and shot many more civilian
Baganda without reason, just
in the hysteria of the event.

'1 We are‘ therefore impressed

with Amin's discipline of his
forces. 1 no longer fill the
bath tub with water to drink in
dose the Tanzanians come with
Chinese weapons! Part of the
interest of this past week has

lain in observing people’s re-
actions to moments of stress,
and I must admit, laughing
later at some of mine. (On
Wed. lgot myself and the car
interior covered with soot,
laying in a six foot ball of
charcoal in case electricity
went off if we were attacked
by Tanzania!)

Afterward: Kampala is ale
most quiet. Yesterday was a
holiday to greet the new Head
of State with ergun saluteand
sear in (on Koran or Bible) the
new cabinet. We hear there is
still fighting in the north, the
seat of Obote’s strength, but
suppose it is a mopping up
operation.

Gen. Amin has promised the
return of multiple political
parties and representation of
all tribes in government. It
will be a fascinating spring
watching it all unfold.

Poster Art, Prints On Display

by Ellen Schiferl

Until Spring break the Shaef-
fer Gallery will exhibit Works
by the faculty of Northern
Illinois University. This is an
excellent display of the defic-
iencies of contemporary art.

The show can be divided into
two forms of art. There is the
poster- oriented social coma
ment, as exemplified byRich-
ard Beard. The effect is im-
mediate and little else. His
colors are harsh and histech-
nique is graceless to thepoint
of being amateur. Although
the social themes are simple,
obvious, andhackneyed, Beard
doubly insults his viewer's
intelligence by the addition of
such labels as "Black Power"
and titles like “With Justice
for All."

Second, many of the works
reveal the renewed interest
in printing and experimenta-
tion in new techniques, such
as seriography. But original
content and creative form have

lagged sadly behind the ad‘
vance in technique. Some of
the prints lack content entirer
ly, while Others, such as the
works of Driesbach subjugate
new techniques toold subjects.

In general the worksare cold
and unimpressive, failing to
establish any rapport between
viewer and artist. This art is
devoid of both imagination and
human feeling. Neither social
message nor virtuouso tech»
nique is enough to give value
to a work of art.

the situation. For the people
in each residence unit would
be voting for a ticket of two
people, one their House Pre-
sident, and the other, in ef-
fect, their Senator. But they
could not vote for them sepr
arately. This doesn’t make
sense.

Furthermore there would
then be about twentySenators.
Almost anyone who has ever
been involved with the Senate

at this school believes thata
Senate of ten is the maximum
number able to debate effi-
ciently. A suggestion has
been made to have the most
interested out of the twenty
serve as Senators. Unless jobs
are wellrdelineated at the
outset, the work doesn't get
done. We would suggest, in
order to insure better repre
sentation, that Senators be
elected after room draw, one
from every two halls.
