the floor. Ali Akgun emphatically
placed the blame for the Iraqi invar

keep oil prices low, and that this
Kuwait invasion is only to be ex-
pected. His argument was sup-

foreign energy supplies for the
health of the economy. One slur
dent claimed that the crisis proves
the need for Americans to change
their attitudes about energy and
resource consumption.
