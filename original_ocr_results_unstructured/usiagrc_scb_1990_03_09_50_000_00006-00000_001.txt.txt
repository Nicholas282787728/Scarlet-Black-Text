Let's examine the problem
There are a lot of candidates you
don‘t know runnirtg for two SGA
positions you really don't know
much about. So how do you make
a decision? There’s cenainly no
magic formula fordiscovering who
will turn out to be a great SGA
president and vice-president. but
there are some things you can look
for in a ﬁeld of candidates when
making your decision. Or at least
we think so. “We" are Rob Killion
and Ali ElSaffarl Collectively we
have been either SGA president or
vice~president for each of the past
four years. And we hope you find
our suggestions helpful.

Is the candidate able to manage
his or her time?

Effective SGA leadership in-
volves large amounts of time and

responsibilities On a weekly ba«
sis, both the president and vice-
president meet with the Student
Affairs deans, the Cabinet, and the
Joint Board. On a biweekly basis,
they meet with President Drake,
Executive VP Wally Walker, and
Dean (of the Faculty) Dukel In
addition the president sits on the
Committee on Student Life (hi-
weekly). the Community Service
Center Advisory Board (monthly),
and the Alumni Board (thrice
yearly). The vice-president sits on
the Faculty Curriculum Committee
(biweekly) and chairs the Student
Council on Curriculum (biweekly),
Both president and vice-president
attend also attend the monthly fac-
ulty meetings In addition, Presi-
dent Drake often asks the president
and vice-president to sit on ad hoc
committees he forms. This year
both Rob and Alanna sit on the
Planning Committee — a commit-
tee that is planning the long-range
future ot‘Grinnell College. Alanna

also sits on the Lesbian, Gay, and
Bi Task Force and the Ad Hoc
Committee on College Paper Con-
sumption And, lest we forget, the
ofﬁceholder occasionally likes to
attend class, do homework. and go
to a few ponies.

The SGA president and vice-
president must be masters at jug-
gling their schedules. Any given
day these two people often have a
coupleappointrnents with adminis-
trators, a committee meeting, and a
couple classes. Which candidates
strike you as being capable of jug-
gling all these time commitments?
Have they had any experience in
student groups, SGA committees,
etc, that has given them some prac-
tice in managing their time? Do
they have commitments to other
student groups, sports teams, or
volunteer work that might prevent
them from spending as much as
they need to on SGA work’!

views?

The presidentand Vice~president
are the only students who make
presentations to the Board of Trus-
tees. The president speaks to the
Alumni Board. The vice-president
hasaddressedtheiacultyasawhole
in the past. Both speak to Joint
Board every week and, as we‘ve
mentioned previously. both speak
with a considerable number of
ndrninisttaters on a weekly or bi-
weekly basis Tohave an impacton
these individuals and groups, both
the president and vice-president
mustbegood communicators. They
must be articulate, concise, and
patient.

How do the candidates strike
you as being communicators? Do
theirstatements of intent seem clear
or muddled? Do their plans and
goals seem logical or impractical?

SGA?

The yearly infusion of new blood

into the SGA Cabinet is one of
SGA’s most valuable assets, It's
also one of SGA's greatest liabili-
ties, Because the leadershipof SGA
is conﬁrmed of juniors or seniors,
the loss of knowledge after each
Commencement is tremendous
People are rarely in an ofﬁce for
more than one year, and never for
more than two years This means
that SGA’s effectiveness is dimin-
ishedinitiallyeach fallbecausemost
Cabinet members are learning their
jobs from scratch. It also means
that the administration (in which
positions turn over every three to
ten years) has an advantage when
adversarial occasions arise. The
administration can always claim
SGA made an oral agreement the
previous year (or even the year
before that) that undercuts the cur-
rent Cabinet‘s argument. A partial
solution to this problem is electing
people who have had sotne SGA
experience. A president and vice-
presidentwithSGAexpet-iencewill
be in a much better position to help
new Cabinet members and Sena-
tors leam their jobs, They also have
the background to remember what

One could cenainlymake the argu-
ment thatonly one of ttte twopeople
who are elected to serve as SGA
president and vice»president need
to have SGA experience. That has
