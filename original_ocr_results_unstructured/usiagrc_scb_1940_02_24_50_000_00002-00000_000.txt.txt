(3,me ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

By that we mean that the past practice
of audience decisions should be carefully,
but firmly, deposited among the relics of the
glorious past.

Why? For two fundamental reasons:

(1) Favoritism is often the basis upon
which the audience award is made.

(2) The average audience is not suffi-
ciently informed upon the technical aspects
of good speaking to qualify as an expelt
judge,

Hall spirit is an admirable quality, and
campus favorites are most natural—but not
as the basis upon which to decide speech
contests And there are few Grinnellians
who are not familiar with the get-out—the-
,vote placards which appear on hall and cot—
tage bulletin boards before the contest
finals. '

And there are enough Gl‘innellians who
have witnessed audience awards that have
been more than a trifle shaky that the
truth of this charge should be realized with-
out our becoming embarrassingly specific.

That the second reason offered for this
suggested departure from tradition is not
merely undemocratic pessimism should also
be obvious.

An audience composed of those trained
in the principles and practice of public
speaking would undoubtedly be capable of
making an intelligent choice, but it is an
unfortunate, but true, commentary upon the
modern student body that the usual college
audience is not in possession of such traili-

JUNK AUDIENCE DECISIONS

On Tuesday, March 12, ten

dents will tread the boards in this campus'

annual forensic highlight,
speech contests. '

And this year it is our
that the contestants should
deal.

Cast Named
For 'Ghosl‘s'

Currier and Boylen
Given Lead Roles
In Ibsen’s Drama

Margaret QIlTieI‘ as Mrs. Helen
Alving and Alfred Boylen as 05-
Wald Alving will enact the leading
roles in Henrik Ibsen’s “Ghosts”,
drama department play, which
will open Feb. 29, Sarah Sherman
Pryor, director of drama, announc-
ed today.

other members of the cast, sel—
ectad from students in the de-
partment, are Homer McDowell as
Pastor Manders, James Russell as
Jacob Engstrand. and Ruth Sch—
ulte as Regina Engstrsnd.

The action of the play takes
place during the 1880’s in the liv-
ing room of the home of Mrs.
Alving on the west coast of Nor-
way. Scenery for the production
was constructed under the direc-
tion of Alfred Boylen in the new
drama workshop. and features a
view of a fjord visible through
double doors at the rear of the
stage.

Valuable period furniture has
been loaned to the drama depart.
ment for the performances by
Mrs. w. S. Hendrixson.

“Ghosts" is the second of three
great plays written by Ibsen deal-
ing with problems of marriage,
and it is the first of his plays to
be produced at Grinnell college
since 1927, when "A Doll’s House"
was presented.

The plot is based upon the bibli—
cal axiom “The sins of the fathers
shall be visited on the children."
It is a drama of powerful appeal
and dramatic value, she added.

The production will run for three
nights, and students will be sde
mitted by semester fee tickets,
Mrs. Pryor concluded,

It is for these reasons that we call for
critic judges in the finals of the Spaulding
speech contests,

At present, Cl'i ic judges are used in

Gl‘inneil stu-
the Spaulding

candid opinion
get a decent

the preliminary rounds of the contests. And
reliable information is that the terms of the
Spaulding memorial make no stipulations re-
quiring a decision by the audience.
no insurmountable obstacle necessitates the
retention of the past unfair method.

The way is open for the establishment
of intelligent fairrplay. .

Thus,

Why not take it?
