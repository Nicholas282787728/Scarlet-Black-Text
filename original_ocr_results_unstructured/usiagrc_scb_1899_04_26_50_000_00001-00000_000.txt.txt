Chrestomathian.

The Chrestomathian Society
was called to order by President.
Douglass, at the regular hour Sat-
urday evening. A somewhat
smaller attendance than usual was
present. The program was of the
usual order, though several pmr
ductions evidenced a lack of thorn
ough preparation. The ﬁrst nurnr
heron the program was a lecitar
tion by Mr. McKt‘ng. this being
open to criticism principally on
aecountof its brevity. J. M. Crabb
followed with a paper on “Wire-
less Telegraphy.” After a con-
cise review of the scientiﬁc inves-
tigation. leading to the discovery
by Marconi. of the possibility of
transmitting messages without
other media than the air, Mr.
Crabb used carefully drafted illus-
trations, showmg in detail the
workings of the system in its pres»
cnt stage of perfection. Only a
year has passed since Marconi was
ﬁrst successful in his experiments,
and during this time he has perr
feeted his system sufﬁciently to
send messages across the English
Channel, a distance of more than
thirty-ﬁve rnilcs. The subject is
such a new one that all informa-
tion in regard to it must be gathr
ered from the newspapers and scir
entiﬁc journals. Mr. Crabb's pa-
per was ct rather more than ordi-
nary merit, and was the best numr
her of the evening.

Dr. Palmer and Mr. Way ren-
dered a comet duet, accompanied
by Miss Thomson, on the piano.
which was well received. J. L.
Parker gave an illustrated talk,
patterned somewhat after Mtlclls
el's “Dream Life," taking for his
subject “Life.”

“The Power of Capital" was the
subject of an oration by Mr. Way.
The speaker denounced the “slav—
ery otthe people" of to-day, dwell-
ing chieﬂy upon the causes and
effects of the great social wrongs
of the present day. The oration
was strongly written. torce being

 

lost by a somewhat weak delivery.

Messrs. Hamlin. Tltiel and Mc—
Carly. spoke extcmporaneously.
on “The Minstrel Show,” "Our
Ball Game with Knox” and “The
Honor System," respectively.
Each spoke freely and with ease.

The subject for debate, “Re-
solved, That ﬁnancial aid should
be furnished by the state to young
men and women desiring assist-
ance in securing a college educa-
tion," was defended by Parks on
the afﬁrmative and Velin on the
negative, Mr, Parks conteude -
ﬁrst, that aid should be given; sec-
ond, that the state should give this
aid. Many students are excluded
by lack of aid. Many ruin their
health by over-working, that they
may carry themselves through
college. “College lite is an occu-
pation in itself.“ Individuals now
furnish considerable aid. but this
should not be for the “object of
the college is the welfare of the
state" and the body of the people
should therefore furnish all aid
necessary, The money received
by the student would not be a gift,
for each succeeding generation
would repay what itreceived from
the last. .

Velin claimed that aid should be
furnished by the state, not to indi-
viduals, but by better equipping
institutions of learning. Giving
aid to students makesthem objects
otcharity. It is “outdoor relief."
Any ﬁnancial aid tends to pt oduce
"mental, moral and physical lazi-
ness.” State aid would hinder
free speech. The system in itself
would be impracticable.

When the question was opened
to the house R. L. Parker and Mc-
Carty spolre, each being rebutted
in turn by Velin. Parks in rebut-
tal sustained the practicability of
the plan and emphasized the sev-
eral points made by the afﬁrma-
live. The question was decided
in favor of the aﬂﬁrniative.
