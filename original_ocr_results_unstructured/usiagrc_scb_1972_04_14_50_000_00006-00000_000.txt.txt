RockfesﬁvuL Heaven 0r He"

“Paz, Amlstao, Musica
Y Amer“; “Easter in the Caribbean
with Music and Friends“: these
were the themes for Mar y Sol, the
First International Puerto Rican Pap
Festival held April 1—3 at Tortuguer
Beach, Puerto Rico.

Rip—offs, drownings, looting, rape
and murder. these, unfortunately.
were also a part oi Mar y Sol. De-
pending upon what combination of
which elements involved in the festi-
val one experienced, Mar y Sol
could be characterized anywhere be-
tween heaven and hell. For most,
it was a little of both.

The setting for the event 7 white
sand beaches, warm waters, and
rolling meadows - was described by
the producers as “a picture post
card”. Indeed, one young Ms.
emerged from her crowded San Juan
taxi to utter a dazed “This is Para-
dise“. But even so, there were
drawbacks, The tropical sun in-
flicted hundreds of painful cases of
sunburn and sun poisoning, and dese
pite the precaution of hiring life-
guards, several people drowned in
the heavy surf. The site was far
removed from civilization - Vega
Baj'a, the nearest town, had two
telephones, one of which worked.
Good drinking water was scarce,
sanitation facilities just adequate,
and medical facilities barely that.
Yet these were limitations which
most attendants had anticipated, and
they really did little to dampen the
spirits of some 30,000 stateside
youths who had come, after all, for
the “music and friends”. And in
describing these, I am lost in choos—
ing Superlatives.

The producers not only brought to
concert top names in entertainment,
but, as out by one member of J.
Geils Band: "We’re not her to take
the money and run. We‘re here to
have fun.” For three solid days the
best of music would ﬂow from early
afternoon, through evening, and well
past sunrise the next day: Rod
Stewart and Faces, the Allman Ero-
thers Band, Fleetwood Mac, B. E.
King, Alice Cooper, Herbie Mann...
without having been there one can’t
even begin to imagine the concert by
Emerson, Lake to Palmer on still
night air under full moon and swirl-
ing stars.

Nevertheless, there were hassles,
There were problems and delays in
setting up equipment and in timing
the helicopter ferrytransporting the
bands in from San Juan. Because of
these conflicts some groups which
appeared - Savor Brown, Bloodrock,
Black Sabbath - never reached the
stage. The Puerto Rican government
got its licks in too. After trying for
months to cancel the whole event, it
could at least pride itself on barring
John Lennon's appearance in the

country (”wild hippie with a hot
guitar”).

The Puerto Rican press also
cracked down on the festival with
headlines decrying the nudity, drugs,
and ”animalism”. Some of these
charges were not far-fetched. One
interesting dude wore nothing but a
fig leaf strategically attached to a
piece oi rope. Many wore less. As
for drugs, everything imaginable
was hawked with descretion resemb-
ling that of ball park beer vendors
”Animalism", however, is a Crude
distortion wrought by some overly
imaginative Puerlo Rican journalist.
Never, anywhere, have I met agreat-
ei- group of people than the commun~
ity of us immigrants camped at
Tortuguer. And there was a true
community , anyone, everyone
shared Shelter and sustenance,
thoughts and feelings. I cannot really
describe it, and no one can really
understand it without having felt or
experienced it,

But this community was an invasion
force upon Fuerto Rican soil, an in-
trusion upon the native culture.
Families would stroll the beaches
gawking at the “heepees”; hundreds
of men gathered at the shower set-up
to stare at the naked “freaks”.
(There was some debate atthe show-
ers as to who was what), At night
Puerto Rican youths roamed the
beaches, simply being obnoxious
enough to make their presence felt
_ alter all these were their beaches.
But, with time, tension grew. Any-
thing left unattended was ripped off
by armed groups of Puerto Ricans
cruising at night, this including
whole tents filled with belongings.
Beatings began to occur, rapes, and
then a murder, a young man stabbed
to death in his tent. Events built up
gradually, as did tension, hostility.
and fear. But when the music ended
and campers began trucking back
to San Juan, the situation remained
basically cool. People perhaps did
not get the unwinding, relaxing va-
cation they'd planned for, but the
incidence of violence fortunately
sparked no larger confrontations.
What, then, was the experience
Mar y Sol? It was a world of
contrasts. There was a true come
munity of beautiful people drawn to
Mar y $01 to enjoy music and the
presence of each other. But at Mar
y Sol this community found itself at
odds with the already established
community of native Puerto Ricans.
In a final summation, Mar y Sol was
a reminder that there exists 8 subs
stance to fit the ideals founded by
the Woodstock nation, but also an
indicator that the Woodstock nation
is not yet ready to charter an inter—
national brotherhood.

COLORADO

Colorado College, which has been
plagued with a rash of thefts and
molestations of coeds during the
past semester, has instituted strict
new security policies in the school’s
major dormitories. All students en-
tering these living quarters will now
be required to leave their college ID
card or other form of identification
at the front desk,

Administrative officials explained
that they were not trying to cut down
on student freedom, but rather to
stop the wave of thefts which they
attributed primarily to persons irnm
outside the college community.

The Circle K Club, a campus serr
vice organization, has begun a pro-
gram to register student valuables.
For a fee of 10¢ per item. the group
will engrave student's social secur»
ity number or other identifying me |
formation on bicycles, stereos, or I
other valuable possessions.

Editors of the campus newspaper,
The catalyst, were noticeably upset
about the new security plan. Their |
editorial on the matter read in part, |
“Freedom of assembly is a Consti- I
tulional right. That freedom is guarr I
anteed, and the law doesn’t state
that we must relinquish our ID cards I
ilrsi. As far as we know, Colorado I
Springs is still a part of the United |
States of America. And the usa,

ACM Programs Offer Relieic

by Sue Oringel

Right about this point in the semes-

ter, all good escapists (and who
among us isn’t, these days?) are
looking for new and better ways to
avoid present reality (spelled
on-rrk) and to definitely avoid
more of the same for next semester
by transferring, dropping out or go-
ing on a program. (“Man, I’m leave
ingl")

This being the case, I am pleased to
report that there may be new ave-
nues of escape to wliichGrlnnell stuv
dents may turn in the future, The
ACM, in its continuing effort to
develop more meaningful and reler
vant programs for today's college
student, is in the process of drawing
up several new oft—campus pros
grams to be put into effect within
the next two years. Because plans
are not finalized as of yet, the ACM
has not published complete descl‘ipr
tiolls but it has been confirmed that
the new offerings will include all
of the following:

(1) The ACM Utopian Semester

of, the one you’ve actually been on

for as long as you’ve been at Grins
hell but you didn’t know it. The for-
mat ls simple: Each student on the
program receives l6 semester crer
oils for enrolling in and livmg at
his home institution That’s it: this
semester is designated to give the
serious, concerned student an un-
limited opportunity to pursue the
activities he feels are most impor-
tant to his life, such as drinking,
turning on, tripping, ”relating", and
getting his head together.

The advantages to the student are
obvious, and the student's college
will also be benefited by the decrease
in the actual student-faculty ratio.
The Utopian Semester should prove
to be an exciting and successful ex-
periment in modern education, in the
same tradition of A, S. Neill's Sum-
merhill (and if it is, I have dibs on
writing the book!)

For those who would consider this
program just more of the same, a
nlore academically oriented pros
gram might be the answer.

(2) The Arts of Newton and More
shalltown This program, modeled
after the popular London and Flore
ence program, has advantages in its
own right. Those students used to the
cultural variety of Grinnell will de-
light in the wider horizons of two of
Iowa's great cultural centers.

MarshnlItown, iamed for its croft
shop and antique store, boasts a
Younkers and lots of lriendly people.
You'll visit the birthplace of Jean
Seaberg, famous movie star, and ex-
wife of Millionaire Howard Hughes,
and by the end of the semester, you’ll
realize just why she left, Newton
boasts the famous Maytag factory,

which you will get to know intimately,
another Younkers, and more friendly
people. Field trips to spot(s) of my
terest, Such as the domed Newton
City hall, are but one of the many
intriguing features of this semester.

But how about something a little
more down to earth? Right on!
Check the following program:

(3) The ACM Third World SEmESA
ter You’ll work in a factory and
punch in every morning, get hassled
by the [at capitalist b055, join a
union, and live in a slum “Learm
ing by doing“ is the motto of this
program, and you may learn that
college life isn’t so bad after all.

The last program seems as though
it was designed with Grinnell stun
dents in mind. It‘s easy to predict
that this one will be very popular...

(4) The ACM California Semester
This unique program is designed for
the serious student who wants toget
himself together in the most together
state of the union. The program ins
eludes hitch hiking (extra credit for
backepacking) to and from the pros
j'ect center ( a secluded site on the
coast near San Francisco) and work-
ing on an independent project.

Each student Will live in a commune
and learn about alternative life
styles, organizing farming, mystir
cism and yogurt, and basic ”relat-

ing." Famed for its iriendly people;
good dope, sun and beautiful beaches,
and all-around good vibes, this pros
gram will help each student to get it
together in the meaningful, relevant,
unforgettable way. If California can't
help you, nothing can,

These, then, are the new programs
ACM will be offering shortly. If
you’re interested, sign up today. as
waiting lists are being filled until the
applications come out. If these pro-
grams don't appeal to you, there are
always others to choose from; be
sides, you can still stay at Grinnell,
transfer, or drop out. Settle down
with a good romance comic book and
dream about the real world, ,
