KING: Notes divergent
groups on campus

Vice Presidentand the enormous time
commitment that is required in can
rying out the duties of that position. I
also think that my panicipation in
Joint Board and the Health Commit
tee serves as a good precursor to ink»
ing control of the VP position.

I understand now what being a
senator is all about. In fact, I am
interested in restructuring the role of
senator. which has also been the rear
sonin g for the recentinterest in ‘dorm
councils.’ SGA is in a period of tran-
sition. and I believe that my knowl-
edge of the present senatorial proce-
dures would help to make the transir
tion in a sound manner,

As for my yearly Vice Presidential
projects ; I would be concerned with
increasing Grinnell’s retention of stun

dents. I feel that grinnell is failing in
many ways to keep students happy,
and as VP my duties would let me
work with the academic problems
while inﬂuencing the President and
ACE representative to work with the
social problems at Grinnell.
Grinnell consists of two social
groups which do not interact very
often; I believe that much of the so-
cial problems at Grinnell stem from
this bisection of campus. I wish to
unify the campus in order to create
more pleasent and livlely Surroundr
ings; this is the function ofSGA. In
fact, the presentcabinetmembers have
already undertaken the projectof uni-
ﬁcation of the campus wtth ventures
suchastheCarnival,thecoffeehouse.
and Minnie’s work with the alliance
of the departments through the Stu-
dent Educational Planning Commitv

tee. I would try to continue and im-
prove these ideas whilc at the same
time trying to implement some of my
own ideas. For instance, I would like
to create a campus communication
board which would consist of flych
for all-campus events and the less
publicized dorm events (i.e. moving
nights, floorparties. etc..).Addition-
ally,Iwouldlikctohearstudentinput
on how to improve on administrative
events, such as room draw.

If you have any questions about
myideasorqualifications,fcclfrecto
call meat 3977 or vax me [KING], or
come to the Open Forum with any
further inquiries. Additionally, feel
free to ask any of the cabinet mem
bers or other senators about my per-
formance in SGA. I hope that on
March 4 you think to write me in.

BRENTNALL: Open to all points of View

continued from page 6

first quﬁtion, I think my involve-
ment with the SEPC is very invalu-
able. I thirtkmy personal characteris»
tics of determination, getting the job
done. and openness too listening to
all points of view and the ability to
take these views to the administration
is very important, Also I think the
position of VP can be very stressful
and I think I would be able to handle
that stress with my sense or humor
and the simple ability to be able to
laugh at myself, I'd hope that that
would help get me Utrough the job.

What innovations can you offer as
a potential president of Academic

Affairs?

Onceagain,goingbacktothestudy
that I proposed. looking into how the
campus has changed over the last
couple of years is very important,
also looking into multiculturalism
more than me have in the past and
proposing changes there. I’d like to
hold open forums and address any
other concerns that students have as
well, upecially early on next year so
thatany ISSUCS l have not addressed at
this point could be brought up to the
Vice President, and any action that
needs to be taken on those concerns
can be.

What doyou feel should be the role

of .IUDCO with the proposed
change from HACS to hall coun-
cils?

IUDCO is thereas a studentjudiciary
board to handle problems with stu-
dent behavioras faras, well, anybody
who is taken to IU'DCO, they have
committed a very violent or harassr
ing act on another student The hall
councils as proposed thus far are gor
ing tobe setup tode with issues that
relate to the dorm only, such as non-
smoking dorms, what are wegoing to
do with the lounge, singlersexed or
cored bathroomsithose are the is-
sues that the councils are going to
deal with and that’s very independent
of what JUDCO docs and it’s impor-
tant to keep these roles distinct.

ence of organizing some activities.
I’ve had a lot of experience in high
school with student government stuff,
butin terms ofstuffherc atGrinnellI
would say being a HAC has helped
me learn how to do these kinds of
things.

What innovations can you offer as
a potential president of Academic
Affairs?

One ofthe biggestthingsl wantto
work on is creating a minor system at
Grinnell. I think it’s an important
thing that we can add to the curricu-
lum. A lot of other colleges have
minor programs and I think it will
make a graduate of Grinnell appear
stronger in thatit's going to give em-
ployers, especially ones who aren‘t
familiar with Grinnell, a really better
ideaof what that student is capableof
because, say you’re a business who

gets a transcript along with
somebody‘s resume, you really don't
have any idea what those courses
mean. Like, if one person takes a lot
of blow-off courses in one depart-
ment, what does that mean compared
to somebody else taking a few more
advanced classes. and so I think hav»
ing a minor system is going to give
people thatstamp of credibility from
the college 7 the college is saying
“0K, we're going to recognize your
efforts in this department and we’re
gorng to let you declare a minor, and
I think that will also help people who
have independent majors to give their
work more definition and gives people
a lot better idea of what you're on
pable of. It would be a little more
paperwork for the registrar and it
would require the dcpartmean to sit
down and decide what courses they
were going to do, but if I’m elected
we’ll create proposals to the depart;
ments about what kind of courses we
think will be appropriate for a minor

system and, I think, it would hardly
cost anything, really.

Why do you want SGA to examine
the Freshman Tutorial?

I don’t think there’s necessarily
any specific problem 5 with the tutori-
als. I had a good experience in my
tutorial and I think a lot of people do,
ljust think its important for SGA to
take an active role in the tutorial sys-
tem and conduct our own study to
find out what the campus opinion is
about the tutorial and, if warranted,
provide suggestions on how the tuto»
rial can be changed or recommend
that it be left alone. The way I see it,
we would conduct a study of all the
first year students after first semester
and alsoall the professors who taught
a tutorial and try and get an idea of
what theirfeelings are about the tuto-
rial and see what they think should be
changed or what they think should be
left the same.

etship that will recognize, and repre
sent the interests of the studentbody.

The Office of Vice-President must
do more than take a stand on the
issues. The hiring of professors that
will meet, and reﬂect thediversecul-
tural demands of the campus; using
the Student Council on Curriculum
to voice student opinions to the ad-
ministration; concerns about the new
hall council system next year; the
new Coffeehouse opening up after
Spring Break; the town/college rela
tionship, and the promotion of a

healthy campus community area few
of the issues The difference is in the
ability to implement ideas that will
improve these situations and get the
process moving, The person best able
to do that will be the one best able to
manage and lead. I believe I am that
person.

I understand the time commitment
it will take to do the job right. My
motivation is a genuine concern for
the health and vitality of the Grinnell
campus community. I have the past
experience, and the desire necessary
to do an excellent job. I hope you
think so too.

OSTERGREN: Dialogue

role in appraising its worth,

In the area of Judicial Council I
would seek to continue the effons of
the present Vice-Presidentin a evalu-
ation of the IUDCO system. Given
the enormous changes occurring in
the way residence halls are governed
the role of IUDCO must also change.
The reason of the new hall council
system is to put more governance
back into the hallJUDCO’srole may
very well be only to handle cases
involving residenm of different halls,
gross violations of the community’s
rights, creases involving hall council
members. In addition I believe that
the IUDCO system should be evalu-
ated in regards to it procedures and
how it protects the rights of both the
