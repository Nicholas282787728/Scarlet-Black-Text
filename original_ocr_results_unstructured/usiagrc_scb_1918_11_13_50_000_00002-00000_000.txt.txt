DOING OI‘R DUTY.

Chapel last Monday morning was a
wonderful and impressive service——
perhaps the most wondei-tul chapel
service in the history or Grinnell. The
news had just come of a Victo ious
peace for humanity. In the midst of
the tumultuous r oicing which inul'ls
tably'folioll‘cd, it was peculiarly ﬁtting
that those in attendance at this ser
ice should have gathered together for
the purpose not only of giving thanks
but of expressing in a tangible

such individuals were present. {or

It is natural that we should «one

The Fourth of July. a treat had been
planned for the in At great troulile

apiece). A speech and athletic games
had been provided tor. But the whole i
company had to more at 11 o’clock, so i
the me making was postponed until ‘
in the atternoon, when. as she said:

“We had two G. I. cans full of lone.
onade. The men formed in line andl

the line seemed longer than ever, when

Pas 'ng to serious \‘K‘lll. Miss Mll-
lard described the march to the scar
and battle of the Marne. The boysl
in the first division. with whom luiss
luillerd and Miss Drott were working.
had been in the trenches practically all
the time since January 1st. They were
always sure they were going to rest
camp. It was with this some hope
that they moved camp on July 14th.
The two women were taken along, as
a special raver. Most oi the way,
they marched with the men.

But the march continued for ﬁve
days and nights. The men had no
thought of going to hattie. They said
at the end of the march that they had
never felt better in their lives.

"1 don’t know whether the second
battle of the Marne was a surprise to
the Germans or not," Miss Millard
said. “But I do know it was a sur-
prise to the Americans. Most of the
men had no notion they were going to
the trout until two hours boiore they
went ‘over the top.‘ H

For a week following this strenuous
march Miss Millerd worked in a hoe-

fcht‘l and drink to the wounded, and
