Diverse Problems Solved By ﬂown

by Elaine Carey

The old saying “can’t yudge a book
by its cover” certainly applies to
the director oi the physical plant,
Dale Hawn, His position and organs
ization rank among the most vuI»
nerable to complaints or any on
campus. The “bad guy” image oi
Hawn and his employees quickly di-
minishes when the man andhis crew
are examined.

Coming to Grinnell in 1967, Mr.
Hawn was an associate director
under Walden until May, 1971 when
Mr. llawn assumed iull responsir
hilities Housekeeping, the heating
plant, security, the plant trades
groups such as plumbers and elecs
tricians, groundkeepers, and tele-
phone services are the responsi-
bilities oi the director and his staff
of approximately 82 of which 50%
is devoted solely to housekeeping.

The primary iunctioh oi Hawn’s
Physical Plant is to keep the coir
lege operating but it also must
cope with the modifications, alter-
ations, and additions demanded by
changes in the college community.

Mr. Hawn received his training
for his occupation at Iowa State
University, after a childhood in
Burlington, lowa and service in the
Navy during WWII. Upon receiving
his BA in civil engineering, Hawn
was employed by the concrete and
steel industries beiore returning
to Iowa State University to work on
his MA Teaching a freshman ens

giheering drawing class at Iowa
State University consumed some at
his time until he returned to the
construction industries and fourye-
ars with a Des Moines arcllitectur~
al firm. The next twelve years saw
Hawn with Lovejoy Construction oi
Des Moihes and during that period
he worked in Grinnell supervtsihg
the construction oi the heatiilg plant
oi the college, along with new and
remodeling projects in the town.‘
From this experience, Mr Hawn
accepted his post at the college not
as a stranger with the town and
college people but with an impres—
sion oi Grinnell as a “good, solid
community” whose liie is enjoyable,
Contrary to perhaps common as
sumption, the academic buildings
require almost more attention than
the dorms. As progress in education
is made, constant change intheaca-
demic buildings are warranted,
Hawn stated, giving as an example
the present redoing ol' the Burling
Library basement, Dorms, es-
pecially due to their age and miss
use, propose propose problems for
members of the physical plant. The
concrete irame structure, the walls,
and the floors of the dorms are as
good as any that could be built
today, although the interior finishr
ing, space allotments, wiring, and
plumbing leave something to be de-
sired, Hawn commented When the
dorms were constructed, college
life was more austere, so that the

dorms are not designed ior vigor-
ous social activities, l-lawn added.
Administrative personnel, including
himself, are aware of the dorms’
shortcomings but the overall eco—
nomic situation oi the college is too
tight to permit much attention tothe
sore spots oidorms,l{awnadmitted,
The most common problem Hawn
has is to minimize repairs in order
to hold costs down. All inability to
make students conscious that our
tailment oi miseuse of facilities
postpones increased iees is part oi
the dilemma Hawn suffers with the
dorms. Using water lights as an ex-
ample, Hawn explained that while
the water is easily mopped up,
months later the plaster begins to
tail due to water damage, not mens
tioning the twenty man hours aweek
spent reiillihg iire extinguishers.

The solution to the misuse and van-
dalism, though, Hawn attributes to
students governing themselves.

Special projects are Irequentlyass
signed to the physical plant such as
remodeling ARH, design and con.
struction of Nollen House, the con~
struction of the bookstore, convex»
sion oioilcampus housinginto coops
or iaculty duplexes.

Research on cost estimates, buds
get control, short and long range
planning, designing and engineering
relating to renovation oi new pro-
iects are some at the more speciiic
tasks Hawn undertakes personally.

A new perplexity has arisen ior

ﬁelds of other colleges

DORM BURNS,
FIRE ALARMS IGNORED

(Delender)--Pulling lire alarms late at night
in college dormitories is a widespread and slips
posedly harmless jag practiced at colleges the
roughout the nation.

However, to the residents of Sisson Hall at
Defiance College of Ohio, this jag took on very
serious implications on the night of February
21, when sisson Hall burned to the ground in
the pre-dawn hours.

Residents of the hall who were awakened by
the tire alarms in the building ignored them
until Resident Advisers went from door to
door, warning students that the alarm was very
serious.

One student suffered Second degree burns while
escaping from the flaming structure, Total dam~
age to the building was estimated at $639,000,
with an additional $51,000 damage to college
Owned contents.

College officials estimated that it would be
six months before damage figures tor personal
student property could be assembled from in-
dividual insurance agents.

College officials and several Letters to the
Editor commented on the very real possibility
of severe injuries or death which had existed
because at the tire alarm jags,

Board may lose as much as $7000 from the dis-
astrous Taj Mahal/Wishbone Ash concert last
November. Although initial ticket receiptstotaled
over $12,000, $10,000 was refunded to ticket
holders because the concert did not come off as
planned.

In addition, the SAB has paid out almost $2,000
ior uncontested bills (printing and publicity) and
another $3750 to the Minnesota booking agency
which handled the twin bill,

However, a second payment to the booking ag-
ency, as well as payments to the Des Moines
Ice Arena and Audio Associates, which handled
sound for the aborted event, have been held
up on advice or the University’s attorney.
Despite the heavy loss, the SAB is planning
more major concerts . including a tentative

was “in very plain sight" in one olthe ransacked
rooms, and that no inference of guilt had been

as well as college plays and con»

Hawn expresses an enjoyment oi
student contact which in his posts

rectify their complaints before they

The success or the physical plant
is given by Hawn to his “dedicated
