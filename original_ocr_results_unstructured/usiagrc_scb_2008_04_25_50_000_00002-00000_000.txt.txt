According to previous decisions, employers may make decr-

significant because it will likely determine which side of a

employers must show that such “reasonable factors" existed
or whether employees must show they did not.

Peacewalks back on the agenda

BY TORREVMACGREGOIK

Ar the beginning of the war in Iraq, Grinnellians protested
in large numbers against the war, But now, five years since the
invasion, fewer and fewer students organize to show their dise
approval, and the number of anti-war groups on campus has
plummeted.

This year, however, a group of ﬁrst
years’ wants to put anti-war activism back
on the campus agenda. Sarah Guff’11,Co-
lin Grove '11 and Kate Moemng '11 started
the Grinnell Student Peace Action Nets
work (GSPAN) to protest the war and pro-
mote peace, both in Grinnell and across the
country. As part of this activism, GSPAN
has revived ‘Peacewalks', weekly marches of
students, faculty and town residents protesting the war in Iraq.

-A group of faculty members first started and led similar
walks in the Spring of2005, following the November 2004 elect
tions, But Goff said "They kind of faded out last year when a
bunch ofjuniors went abroad."

GSPAN’S leaders said they wanted to restart Peacewalks in
order to make opposition against the US. presence in Iraq on
campus more visible and to highlight what they said are inept
ptopriate actions by the Bush administration. “It's an election

(amt/enter,”

”lt’5 an election year so it’s an
important time for people to
have [ the war] back on lllé’ll

year," said Goff, “so it's an important timc for people to have
[the war] back on their consciences."

When debating what types of activities to hold, GSPAN's
leaders decided that the Peacevmlks would be the most effective
way to generate turnout and effectively convcy their message,

“We thought that starting something that
had been going on before would be recog-
nizable to some upperclassmen and people
in the town," Grove said

So far, the group has led two walks, and
the leaders said they were pleased with the
level of participation, “I think we’ve had 20
to 25 [people],"Grove said,

Goff said that most participants in the
walks were notfrom the GSPAN group,and
that some upperclassmen and residents of the town also par-
ticipated. Participants walk through GrinnoLl's downtown and
then stop at the corner of Route 6 and 6th Ave. There, the
group holds up signs with antrwar slogans toward the trafﬁc.

In the near future, the group is planning to host a viewing
of testimony videos from the Iraq Veterans Against the War
organization.

Peacewalks begin in front orthe JRC Fridays at 4:30 pm.

While Krohn said she will miss many of her coworkers, she
will not miss the sometimes unpopular decisions her position
requires,“When you‘re in the Dealt of Students position, there
are just some real tough things you have to deal with,and there
are some things that students don't like, and you have to try
and make the best decision for the student and the institution,"
