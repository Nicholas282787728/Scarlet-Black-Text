DVA/SAC
trains new
advocates

lsv KATHERINE CHUNG

Grinnell student organization Domestic
Violence Alternatives Student Assault Center
(DVA/SAC) is growing in size as it wraps up
training {or new advocates.The organization
is collaborating With other student groups as it
plans new projects for the year.

This year's DVA/SAC is led by Allison
Brinkhorst ‘11 and Alex Peterson '1 1, and advised
by Rabbi Howard stemThe group meets about
once a month, with additional meetings depend
ing it there are upcoming projects, such 25 Walk

advocate, ex
plained that
though “the
organization
itself doesn’t
[meet] a lot,
it’s about
how much
the members want to do personally,"

DVA/SAC is sponsored by greater Iowa or
ganiznrions against domestic violence and sexual
assault that provide onvcampus trainings and
serve as resources for Grinnell’s DVA/SAC.

The group is a campus branch of an Iowa
organization called DVA/SAC that opposes
domestic violence and sexual assault by raising
awareness in the community through on and off
campus events and providing victim support via
the DVA/SAC hotline and peer advocates,

Each year, DVA/SAC campus advocates take
on a variety or events and projects, often draw-
ing help from the wider student body. Last year
DVA/SAC organizedWalk A Mile in Her Shoes
and the Red Flags campaign—both aimed at
spreading awareness about sexual violence in
Marshalltown and both cancelled due to the out-
break of swine ﬂu. Members of DVA/SAC also
helped in the Skylife Project, which tries to get
commutations for life sentences of cases of do-
mestlc violence or sexual abuse.

In order to become a DVA/SAC advocate,
one must complete the mandatory szehour train-
ing component. The training is broken up into
sessions over the course or two weeks and is far
cilitated by a professional instructor from n DVA/
sac shelter, Typically, the training rs ottered on
campus only once a year, but due to increased dce
mand this year, DVA/SAC plans to host another
training at some point during the spring semester.

“Once the training is done, you have legal stae
his in the state orlowa as an advocate which gives
you certain rights,"sard RichaShcafl‘hcse rights
include accompanying sexual assault victims to
the hospital. attending Court proceedings and tar
iusing to be subpoenaed to disclose conﬁdential
sessions,

This year. the organization put together a pie

and is focusing on implementing healthy mine
