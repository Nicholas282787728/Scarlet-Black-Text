Biographer Richardson, novelist Robinson, and poet Pinsky continue the SQC Writers’ Series

By LESLIE MADSEN
Arts Editor

Under the auspices ofthe Sesqul-
centennial Writers' Series, biogra-
pher Robert Richardson, novelist
Marilynne Robinson. and poet Robe
ert Pinsky discussed writing and
read from their works on Tuesday.

Richardson. the author of works
about Thoreau and Emerson. ad
dressed the importance of cohcsion
in biography.

Richardson shared a few pages,
about clipper ships. that never made
it into his Emerson book;
Richardson had originally Intended
for the book to be unified by sailing
metaphors and images because he
felt Emerson was in many ways like
aship. However.
when his editor

asked him we"! Hirsch remarked that
successful writers
tend to speak
in terms that are
“uncomfortably
mystical.”

forty pages from
the work, he
sacrified the sail»
ing sections be-
cause they did
not directly in-
volve Emerson's
life. In addition.
Richardson ad
mitted, Emerson
detested sea
travel and was prone to violent scar
sickness.

But Richardson still felt the book

needed a controlling metaphor. -

Looking this time Into Emerson's

personal philosophles, he settled on
volcanoes because Emerson was
both fascinated by volcanic activity
and believed in what Richardson
termed “a single. Common. underlyr
ing fire" from which all people draw
their creative and spiritual encrgy.

Richardson also discussed his rcr
liance on narrative for the Thoreau
biography. Originally, he had
planned to examine the relationship
between Thoreau's reading and write
ing, alid became very absorbed in
this task, However. he found the bin
ography was very intcnial and trans»
fomied Thoreau into “a very rareﬁed
figure."

When flnished writing the
Thoreau biography, Richardson

tual" {or the market of popular
books. But he seemed in some way
pleased that his work ﬂoated in such
a gray area, He emphasized that bi-
ography remains a very fluid me-
dium, There are no schools where
one can get a degree in biography,
he said. '
He addressed, too, the issue of
length, As an academic, he was
trained to write twenty-page papers
and fortyepage chapters. However,
he had to learn to write in the shorter
unitsiusually thrcc pagesithﬂt are
more palatable to readers.
Marilynne Robinson did not ad-

dress as many technical concerns
about writing as did Richardson, but
instead discussed the more spiritual
side ofwriting. She talked about the
creation of her novel Housekeeping,
which was born by accident while
she worked on her doctoral thesis
Upon finishing her thesis, slie gath-
ered together the scraps she had writ-
ten and, in a small, windowless room
in Brittany—“a sort of sensory dope
rivation Chamber'iwrote the novel.

Housekeeping is inionhed by the
landscape of Robinson's hometown
in Idaho. Her family had resided in
the town for four generations when

Robinson left to attend Brown Unlr
vcrsity. Robinson swirtly discovn
cred that the other Brown students
found incomprehensible the con-
ditions of her upbringing, Upon
realizing her experience was for
eign to many, Robinson became
interested in writing about it.

Robinson said writing the novel
felt akin to “describing [thc] liur
man civt|l7atioli of a hostile
planet." The novel concerns one

relation to her family‘s tragic his
tory. in composing Huun‘e’kc'epl/lg,
Robinson hoped to demonstrate
that “in some deep sense we are not
native hcte " People must some
how “mend" thc conditions of their
existence.

Robinson found one of her
greatest difficulties in writing the
novel was her academic training.
As one who is “critically trained,"
she found it hard not to create “pate
terns that impose themselves" on
her writi g. She tries very hard.

Visiting Professor Edward
Hirsch. who mediated the discus»
sion between Robinson and
Pinksy. commented that successful
writers tend to talk in terms that
are “uncomfortably mystical."
Plnsky agreed. but emphasized that

other artists feel the same, “The
teasing out of the unconscious,“
Pinsky said. is not unlike the men-
tal states achieved by musicians or
daydreamers.

As a poet. Pinksy said, “you
can't define yourself because
you’re still studying the rest ofthe
world to see how it‘s different than
you," In this sense, Pinsky does
not know if his trilnd is more llr
logical or more ordered than the
nonrpoet's.

Pinsky said that those interested
ill becoming artists must be able
to fall in love with music, art, lite
crature, and architecture because
such ti passion is key, he believes,
to becoming a successful arllst,

Ptnsky also translated Dante’s
Inferno, tic compared the thought
processes behind this task with
solving crossword puzzles. He
explained that “problem solvlng is
part of art" because art is not
simple

it is, in many forms, a “beauti-
l'ul absorbing difficulty." Hirsch
described this process of problem
solving and learning as therefore
“cgolcss"—lhe satiation of some
appetite.

Whatever one's life path, Pinsky
said, one must find something dif-
ficult and “consuming." He admit—
tcd, however. that this search may
be the root of the depression felt
by many college students,
