Post, returns
to Grinnell

by Lorri Lohmann

Jim Post will give Grinnell a
welcome charge at energy Saturday
night. It Will be Post's third time on
campus and judging from his earlier
pertormances, he will have no trouble
setting olisparks. For those uniamiliar
with him, Post is a Chicagosbased folk
singer/songwriter and perhaps more
than anything, a periormer

His emotion and spontaneity on the
stage led another Chicago folk musi-
cian, Jim Craig, to explain that "it's
Theatre." Post mixes a broad, easy
vocal range and guitar playing, which
has finally been labelled
"respectable," with an energy and
idealism which touches all his work.
His songs oiten celebrate nature and
lrown on people who destroy it, other
people or themselves. in performance.
the songs {low as Post does, talking to
the audience and improvising all the
while. ,

i-iis proiessional career began in the
early '605 With a iolk group called the
"Rum Runners." He enioyed a hit
single "Reach Out in the Darkness"
and moved soon alter and developed a
loilowihg in San Francisco He signed
with Fantasy Records there, which also
represented Credence clearwater
Revival at the time

He settled in Chicago several years
ago and plays small clubs in the city
irequently, in addition to recording ior
Mountain Railway Records. Post is still
most remembered lor his energetic
concerts and as Larry Rand of Chicago
magazine described him, "he can whip
out of a gospel tune into a testifyin' sers
mon such as "Jesus Gain' Fishin' as
smoothly as the lox makes for the
bushes "

Folk musician Randy Sablen will ap-
pear with Post Saturday in South
Lounge at 9 and 10215 p m. it will be in-
teresting to see Post share a periorr
mance with a ieiiow musician. Mostly l|
