The Intruder.

Thursday evening. in iesponse
to invitations issued by the Dra-
matic Club, a small audicncc gath-
ered in Chresto Hall to witness
the presentation of Maeterlinck’s
"Intruder.H Miss Rew opened the
evening with a ﬁnely rendered
violin solo, a ”Romance,” by
Svendseu. A very essential part
of the program was the prciatory
talk by Mr. VVhitcomb, on Mattel-
lincl<’s Symbolism in thc Intruder.
These remarks not only served to
put the audience m inf/EN with
Maeterlinck’s spirit in general, as
manifested in his drama, but also
as an excellent exposition to the
play itseir'.

The “Intruder" is not a drama
proper, but only an episode, and
as such has pertect unity of time
and place. The event, around
which the action groups itselt is
the coming or death into a house
hold. The midnight hour, and the
loneliness of an isolated chateau
are in keeping with the central
theme, as are such incidents as the
sharpening or the scythe heard
outside, the noise of footsteps, the
opening of the door, the going out
of the lamp, the stopping oi the
clock.

The symbolic import of the
above. with that Of thc characters
was suggestively outlined by Mr.
Whitcomb.

Mrt Owen’s rendering ol the role
of the grandfather was excellent,
his interpretation heing sympas
thetic and adequate; and though
far removed from the spirit of the
role of the English barrister lately
presented by him, equally well
done. This speaks much for Mr.
Owen's ability as an actor. This
character of the grandiathcr, syms
bolizes old age with no reliance
upon intuition, not unmixed with

superstition, as opposed to thc
common-sense reasoning oi the
materialistic mind represented by
the uncle and the dull, matter-oi»
fact father. The rolcs of father
and uncle were well given by Mr.
McCarty and Mr. Nollcn. Possi-
bly thc former admitted of a morc
sympathetic rendering.

Miss Currie,as the eldest daughs
ter, showed understanding and ap-
preclntion of the character; her
repose oi niannerwas exception
ally.g00d and accorded with the
spirit or the play, as did likewise
the rythmic movement of the
three sisters. Miss Scammon and
Miss Noel,as the second and third
daughters, did excellent pantos
mime work; especially is this true
of the former.

The general criticism might be
made that the action was too
mucir hurried at the very close.
arid that had it not been [or Mr,
Wliitcomb’s introduction, the ads
dieucc would not have realized
the death of the mother. More
frequent promptings were needed
than is usually the casc with the
club, but this was doubtless owing
to the difﬁcult nature of the cues
and the monotonous character of
the dialogue.

The Dramatic Club is to be con-
gratulated in its success in this
First year at its existence. The
(act that it cared to study and
present a play such as this or
Maeterlinck’s \ays much for the
earnest and studious spirit which
animates the club.
