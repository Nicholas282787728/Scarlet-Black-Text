Sharing a Break:

Students Help Des Moines’ Homeless

by Ann Trcistrnan

“How was your break?" is
the question greeting most
returning Grinnellians these
days, and for the 35 students
who participated in the
Alternative Winter Break
program, answers range from
great to really great.

“A lot of positive things
happened," says Kent Koth.
who coordinated the program.
Koth, a senior, explained his
idea of a group of students
living in inner city Des Moines
[or a week and working through
certain agencies to help the
homeless. stemmed from the
interest shown in the Friday
Alternative Happy Hour
program.

Koth worked with Cynthia
Carver, coordinator of
community programs for
Trinity United Methodist
Church in Des Moines, to
design the Happy Hour visits.
Students from Grinnell meet at
the Grill every week and travel
to the church. arriving just after
Trinity‘s community kitchen
serves dinner to those who
cannot afford to feed themselves.
0n Fridays. Grinnellians spend
a few hours playing with the
children, but during the week of
Jan. 12, they had the
opportunity to really submerge
themselves into what was
happening in the inner city.

The inner city is an area of
about two and a half square
miles within Des Moines.
Approximately 10,000 people
live there; one third are children,
another third are elderly, and
ﬁfty percent are black. In this
densely populated area, many
people live in run-down, over~
crowded homes, or on the
streets. Drugs and gangs are
increasing in popularity, but
Koth hopes that maybe the
Grinnell students can
demonstrate some alternatives
for the numerous children.
“Kids are starting to ask,

‘What is college? What is
GrinnellT” explained Koth.
“Maybe some seeds are being
planted.“

Some seeds were certainly
planted in the minds of the
Grinnell students who spent
their last week of break in the
inner city. Kirsten Finlayson
says that the experience gave her
“renewed commitment to
become involved in volunteer
wor ."

This sense of renewal
touched many of the speakers
who talked to the students in
meetings arranged by Koth. He
commented, “They got excited
because we got excited. (They
realized that) the next generation
is going to come through." The
speakers varied from the
principal of Moulton
Elementary School, a school
across the street from the
church, in which 95% of the
students qualify for free lunch,
to Vern Lyon. the head of
Hispanic Communities.

Lectures were only a part of
the Grinnell students‘ schedule,
Every morning, they would get
up early to help with the
church’s Breakfast Club. a free
breakfast for about 150 children
of the inner city At 9:00, they
split into groups and performed
various tasks with some of the
city's programs for the
homeless. Those working with
the Habitat for Humanity
repaired abandoned houses which
will later be sold at cost to
people who cannot afford a
home at market prices
Repairing and generally fixing
up living spaces occupied
Grinnellians helping the Des
Moines Coalition for the
Homeless and the Catholic
Worker House. Others played
with young children at the
Model Cities Preschool. The
Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, the Broadlawn
