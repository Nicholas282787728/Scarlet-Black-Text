Grinnell nuke- fee

Freeze and Disarm, Inc., has an
nounced that Grinnell College is now a
nuclear free zone. This symbolic act
declares that Grinnell College is off
limits to the design, testing, production
and deployment of nuclear weapons, it
also bans related activities such as
nuclear waste burial, uranium mining
and military reserachi Declaring a
nuclear free zone involves asking any
government with nuclear weapons '00
remove the zone from their target list
and renouncing any right to be defend-
ed by nuclear weapons.

The prohibiuons included in the
declaration are purely symbolic and
have no legal basis, but because it is a
population decision, politicians should
take note. Governments of several
countries and hundreds of cities and
communities have declared themselves
nuclear free zones, as well as the con-
tinents of South America and Antares
tlca.

The Academic Wringer
Faculty/Grads note increase in pressure

by Bub Little

(Third in a seriel)

ls stress a new phenomena to Grinnell Col
lege? Is this .i rehtl'vely recent development
that students face? Wt was ”stress" like 30,
m or even five years ago? These questions were
posed to three Grim-ell alumni who on: current-
1y professors hemzAhm Jones, History, cores of
1950,- Jonathan Andelsort, Anthropology, Class
of1970; ond Robert Km/t, Psychology, Chm of
1975. Their interesting responses reflect the at-
titudes of the times in which they graduated.

stress, the “thing” that is causing the
Student body of Grinnell so much grief, is
debated even among the alumni.

All three professors Claimed to have a
“no stress" atmosphere during their years
at Grinnell. Jones gave reasons why this
was true for him,

First. he was irom the postwar genera-
tion of veterans attending college. They
had previously been in situations oi incom-
parable stress, and in contrast, college
presented a peacelul and relaxing at
musphere. The older students enjoyed coir
lege.

Secondly, the academic style oi the col-
lege was not as intense as it is today. The
curriculum has been improved with more
emphasis placed on good writing skills,
and the iaculty has grown and improved
with the curriculum. The program, as a
whole, has become more rigorous. what
was then a strictly textbook/lecture class
has evolved into a paperback/discus
sion/writing seminar which is more
demanding and timerconsuming, producA
ing more competent students.

Thirdly, Jones stressed that the students

graduating in his time had a positive
future ahead. This generation doesn't look
hopefully toward the future. Young people
today are very concerned about the place
they will eventually occupy in a com»
petitive society. Thus, some ot their
pressure is selfrgenerated. They feel
obligated to maintain a high GPA to enable
them to continue in a competitive
academic program, which will then give
them positions in the higher~paying strata.
This is a competitive society now, which
has generally made for less enjoyable col-
lege experiences.

Jones was quick to point out that he
believes stress today is real. It is not just
academic stress. He stated that Grinnell is
more ofa “party school” than it was in his
day. Parties are now more frequent and
more informal, “I guess the need to keep
up socially and academically would put a
lot ot stress on any student,” he
hypothesized. "I don't know how they can
do it.”

Andelson, in contrast, doesn‘t believe
"stress” was the vocabulary of students in
the late '605 and early ’70s, though he ad
mitted that perhaps he and his closest
friends were not to be taken as a represens
tative sample.

"We were the studlers, the hard-
workers," he explained. "It was nothing
for us to study 40 hours-plus a week.” lie
believes that students today don't study
more than two or three hours a day. “I
don't even remember hearing complaints
about stress We were hereto study 't was
taken. for granted that we would,"

 

 

 

 

Kraft echoed Andelson's claim about
stress not being in the student vocabulary
when he was at Grinnell, “We called it
academic pressure’ in those days,” he
said, students just learned to cope with it.
Academic pressure was a topic of some
concern but it was not widely discussed
like the phenomena of stress is today

Kraft believes stress to be an internal
problem while academic pressure is
generated by the outstde, "Stress is too
widely circulated today: lt's in vogue," he
claimed. "Students hear a lot about it and
begin to think it exists for them."

Student government must make a
stronger effort to elicit student opinion and
unify these sentiments into a coherent
position. Vocal protests over SGA’s inabilir
ty to effectively respond to pertinent
academic, social and administrative
issues are Valid. The EPCs, student
organizations and individual student sens
timents salient to immediate issues should
become SGA’s fundamental priorities.
While monetary allocation for social inner
tions is a necessity for college life, issues
such as core curriculum, tenure decisions,
buffer days. pass/tail deadlines, divest-
ment, etc., must receive increased atten-
tion by student government. SGA must
take on a more active role in informing
and questioning the campus community in
order to determine and represent student
opinion on such issues. These views must
be consolidated in order to more effective-
ly and accurately influence administrative
and social decisions.

A strong SGA administration is imr
perative if student opinion is going to ettec-
tively inﬂuence administrative and social
decisions. SGA must allow student opinion
to determine decisions. Thus, if elected
SGA president, I would make every at
tempt to elicit, unity and develop campus
sentiment into an influential force.

Jon Scharff

An organized body, such as SGA, has
more potential for creating a dramatic el-
fect on campus than does a single in-
diVidual. However, the future efficacy of
SGA depends upon structural im-
provements. In the past SGA has been an

allocator 01 funds and provider of services
rather than the representative voice of all
students.

The creation of a Student Union, an
organization bringing all the different “1'
lerest groups on campus into a uniform
body, is the means I propose to increase
student representation and participation
in SGA. By giving the Union a role in Jomt
Board. the most active and vocal groups
on campus would become part of SGA. In
turn, SGA would represent all of the
students’ interests,

implementing structural changes
depends upon the candidate's flexibility
and objectivity. In addition. the candidate
must fulfill the President’s respon~
Sibilities. These responsibilities are: U
chairing Jomt Board, 2) representing
students before the Alumni Board and
Trustees, and 3) serving as liaison bet-
ween students and the administration.
After serving as a past Joint Board
member and present Cabinet member 1
am confident that I can fulfill these respon-
sibilities. In addition, I realize the frustra-
tions associated with SGA, but I strongly
assert that SGA can be what we want it to
be. .

I hope the most dramatic eiiect my ac»
tinns will have is a continued increase in
student involvement in campus affairs.
This is especially important now with the
number of changes that are taking place
on campus. The futureof Grinnell is being
decided now and the students should have
significant input into what that future will
be.

How can involvement» be

increased

 

achieved? It is something that one person
cannot do alone, One must actively seek
out people and lind out what they are
thinking, All-campus meetings with SGA
members and administration onicials
would be one way to elicit student opinion
Just being among the students is the best
way to iind out what they are thinking.

Once one knows student opinion one has
to act upon it. And through my experience
in sun (hall coordinator, hall pl‘eSIdentt
and as a member of various committees.
for example the Constitution Revision
Committee and the College Judicial Coun-
cil, I teel i have gained a working
knowledge or how to accomplish my goals,

Students have the right to interject their
ideas into the system, and hopefully
through my actions more students will exp
ercise that right.

Pete Hautzinger

If I am elected SGA vice president there
will deiinitely be some changes ln the way
Joint Board operates. I‘ve been a hall
president for the last three semesters and
Joint Board has often been very
frustrating for me. I believe that I know
what is wrong with SGA, and I believe I
know what needs to be done,

The problem with Joint Board is that it
currently has no direction. Too much time
is wasted on trivial, bureaucratic matters.
We need to spend much more time on im-
portant issues of campus-Wide
signiiicance. In order to accomplish this,
the president and vice president must pro
vide more leadership. They have to force
Joint Board to focus its energies on more
important issues.

i believe the biggest problem we now
face is the administration’s increasing
disregard ior student opinion. Little or no
attention is paid to our views on such ques-
tions as buffer days, tenure decisions, hall
fines and core curriculum, Joint Board
needs to discuss these questions and fol»
mulate opinions. These opinions must then
be iirmly communicated to the ad-
ministration.

SGA can still be an effective spokesman
for the student body. First, however, we
need strong and active leadership from the
cabinet. As vice president, I will attempt
to provide this leadership.
