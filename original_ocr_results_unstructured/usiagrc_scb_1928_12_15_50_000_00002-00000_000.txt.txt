THE LVFLlilrxm EPmEmC

News tli latches in the morning paper added the
names of Chicago \lnivc and [he Uliivcr 1)! ol Wis-
cullsin to the long list of schuols Iol'ced to close (in ac~
count of the influenza epidemic threatening to take root.
Gl‘il'lnell is one of the [aw schools remaining in session in
face of the epidemic which has already claimed Bight lives
in Council Bluffs and is threatening to reach the propor—
tions oi a few years ago.

The “flu” is evident in Gi'innell, although not seri-
ous enough to ll'ﬂl' ’mt drastic fiction at present except
as it possible preventative as “'lsconsin oiliCidls have
seen fit In do. The [act that ﬁle situation is no nurse
in the dormitories is in no small measure due to the pres—

eiice ot the house mothers, who are promptly t the lied-
side with the thehuometer and the inoviinhlc pills. They
desei-ro any credit that the institution might deserve in
minimizing the epideiuc iii Gi ell.

, The work of the two in charge of the situation a. the
quadrangle is especially commendable in view of the
numiiei- or clises and the greater number who are iieiiig
exposed to it daily in the class rooms and on the com-

hits.

. PREPI’ING.

While the abolition or prepping at Grinncll has
not caused uni-thing approiichiug a revolution or even

iouod an indignation meeting, opinion i, .-hdrply
( dcd. This [act clearly shown in the campus opinr
ion appearing in this issue. The question of prepping is
nlll ii closed matter. While a great many may argue
against it, an equal number can justly argue For it,
Pi‘clniiug is a moot question. However, it is not our
intention to express our condemnation or approhratioli
oi prepping as it ists. That will come later, How»
ever, there is one phase of the situation that deserves
discussion and that is the planner in which the whole
thing was brought to a head.

The fact that council ot‘ house chairmen tit
to l'cgzll'd President Maui‘s letter as an order couched in
a friendly and suui'tcolls planner, yet an order neverthe—
less, would indicate tlrat the intention or the president
was to issue an order. If this is the case, it is uplortum
ate that the letter was sellt to the house chairmen.

Assuming that the letter to the house chairmen was
ilh order, President ilain's action seems illcousisteutwith

saw

the principles of student government as laid down ii)"
himself. In" a tall: before the Student Council, the pi . .

ident pointed out that there \\ ere three branches oi the
executive government at Grinnell; one tor the students,
auoiher tor; the taculty, and the third tor the atliiliiiistrilr
tioii, Further, he pointed out that any one
groups would handle a matter or concern to only that
group, luit any matter nilectiug two or more groups must
' , lie dealt with by a cooperative group.

Propping is a matter or concern to the students pri—
moiily and after that a llmtler atrocting the whole. school.
On the surlacc it seems that a iuodiiication of the pres
out System was the duty of the student heads. However,
eien stretching a paint, it was a matter or co-operativc
legislation. The fact oi the matter is that neither method
w used. An order was read in the student which in
its very nature would naturally antagonize them. Com-
liiucd with that is the tact that they were completely
ignored and an uiiiortundto situation a 595.

One of the t' st acts at the student governmental hoods
should he to wait upon the president with a protest, ash-
lug that this matter go through its regular channels. It
seems plausihlc that some modi cation would take
place in tile dormitories it it were put up to the men
However. the pros and cons or prepping can be aired
when the mothod is arrived at.
