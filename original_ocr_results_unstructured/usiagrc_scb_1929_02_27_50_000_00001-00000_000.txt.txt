For the first time in several years,
the Pioneers defeated the Drake Bllllv
dogs in a cinder meet when the Mal-
tese team trotted off with first hone
ors in the indoor dual meet at the
Drake fieldhouse last Saturday. The
final event decided the meet in favor
of the Pioneers, the Grinneli mile re-
lay quartet cinching first honors by
romping home half a lap ahead of the
'hluershlrted anchor-man. The score
was 55 2—3 to 48 1-3.

Warner Taylor. appearing in his
second meet of the season was the
star of the alter-noon, winning three
first places. and riinniug on the win»
niug relay team. Taylor copped both
hurdle events in easy style, and in
better than average time, while his
winning leap in the broad jump kept
the Pioneers in the race. If the Eull~
dogs had have garnered first and
second places in this event, which
they held until Taylor's final effort,
the Bulldogs would have won the
meet.

a record of achievement not often

Acro-Arctic Expedition which will go
in 1930, by the Graf Zeppelin, to make
detailed scientific exploration of the

fires of fearless sincerity and reek»

commands instant hero worship.”

"The tutorial system is worked out
so that each student above the il'esl’l'
man rank is assigned to a tutor who
meets with him once a week to rec-
ommend readings and to discuss with
him books he has read. I have
noticed, although my department has
employed the method for less than a
year, that students come up after my
lectures to discuss matters which I
have not tallied about in class and I
know that they must have gotten
thcii information from their reading.

Exchange Professor‘s First Talk
Devoted to Introduction to
Experimental Biology.

WILL SPEAK NEXT MONDAY

Future Lectures Will Deal With
Protoplasmic Substances,
He Announces.

l-lerbert wv. Rand, professor of
biology at Harvard university made
his opening lecture on the Harvard
Exchange program yesterday in a
long chapel at 9:40. He made an in-
troduction into the field of experimen—
tal biology, which relates to plant and
animal growth.

Dr. Rand intends to discuss the im-
portant problems ot the biological
world. He spoke of the gross misun—
derstanding of biology and its uses.
"Many people think that professors
of biology are r iculoiis persons run-
ning about chasing butterflies and
bugs," said Dr. Rand. "I intend to
present to you the bugs we are chas—
ing.”

Describl‘s Protoplnsnt

He spoke mainly in his first lec~
iture of the differences between living
and nun—living substances. “Living
things always have a covering of some
type and are built up of protoplasm.
This protoplnsm has several charac-
tcristlcs which distinguish it from
nonrliving matter. First. it is indivs-
.ible. If a living thing is divided, it
.either disintegrates or regenerates.
Non-l iag matter does not do this.

"Living things insist on a separate
existence. It is not possible to weld
them together. They have a limit in
size. although there is large range.
Protoplasm is contained in a specific
form which cannot change, while non-
living matter has no shape. Living or-
ganisms are made up of unlike parts
which are interdependent.

Smalls Mobility

“The most important difference be-
tween living and noneiiving substanc»
es is that protoplasm is dynamic. It
always has motion while nonvlv'iﬂg
matter )5 inactive. Biological individe
iiality ls the chief characteristic ol
these differences."

Dr. Rand stated that he intends to
examine the substances called proto-
plasm in his future lectures. The secs
oud lecture will be given at a long
chapel next Monday morning, and an—
other on Thursday

Grinnell Co-eds Sh

ow Interest

In Summer Camps Despite Snow

 

The Grinncll girl will believe the
day of practical education has come
when in one of the snowiest weeks of
winter she may study the art of sum»
mer camping. That such a venture
has its attractions, however -
dent by the number oi girls who gath-
cr lor one’hoiir each da iii Rand
gymnasium for the intensiie course
in camp Councillors training given
by bliss Barbara Dllen Joy. member
of the camp Directors association.

Although Miss Joy has given this
course for several years in various
universities, this is the first time it
has ever been offered in a small dole
lcge. Grinnell is singularly forums
ate in procuring her, through the cf-
forts of Miss Andersen, and the w. A
A.

The interest in camp leadership as
a vacation is comparatively recent.
But since so great a part of the popu—
lation has been driven by excessive
city life to seek relief in the great
outdoors, camp leadership has ceased
to be regarded only as a chance for
a good time. and is being seriously
exploited. The Camp Directors assoe
ciation has started trainingrcamps
anti schools at several places tllrougll~

out the country. besides sending out
such people as Miss Joy to make the
college girl who finds summer work
as it cflnlp leader more efficiently ﬁt—
ted for her task.

In an intensive course. individual
problems can only be touched on,
and applied by discussion or the gen-
eral aims and tendencies in camping.
As new tendencies have made them-
selves knuu'n in education, camping
methods also have progressed, get-
ting farther and farther away from
the old military terminology invare
lably connected with camping. and
striving only for a beneficial recre-
ational program. such it program
would best fulfill the aims of camp-
ing. as Miss Joy outlined the
health, physical and mental. acquis-
llion of new Skill and activity. social-
Izing .zind character-building.

Miss Joy has gained her knowledge
of camping through actual Camp
work. She herself is the head of the
Joy camps at Three Lakes, Wiscon-
sin, for older and younger girls, be»
sides which She visits many camps all
over the United States annually In
connection wlth her work in the
