Mattresses in Read
cause restless nights

By RIVA SHARPLES
News Editor

ITHIN the next three
weeks, approximately
80 mattresses in Read

Hall will be replaced, due largely to
student complaints and a petition
signed by students living in the dorm.
The current mattresses, which are de-
scribed as“very thin and hard, without
much give," were installed in Read
during the summer, according to Di-
rector of Housing Oda Callison.

“Read was renovaled over the
summer,“ Callison said. “Whenever
a dorm is renovated, we get new
equipment— desks, mattresses, beds.
These mattresses had been used be-
fore on campus by studentswith back
problems. Someone made the judge
menl that they would be good to
install instead of the regular kind."

Students had not slept on the
mattresses long before complaints
started to roll into the Office of Stu-
dcnt Affairs and a petition was circu-
lated by junior Dave Collman.

“There were quite a few com-
plaints before I started the petition,"
said Collman “I only slept on the
mattressonceandthenlstaned sleep»
ing over at my girlfriend's. You
might say that I just continued the
ball rolling."

Collman collected the signatures
of approximatelyﬁfty students,“some
desperate and others not,” he said.

The petition was given to Stu-
dent Affairs over a week ago, and
new, standard mattresses have been
ordered. They are scheduled to ar~
rive within the next three weeks,
Callison said.

But in the meantime. many stu»
dents are sore and complaining.

“(The mattresses) give new
meaning to the word ‘room and
board,” said sophomore Seth Hosier.

Senior Carrie Landfried felt that
the only redeeming quality of the
mattresses was that “you can sit in
bed with a beverage and itwon’tspill
there‘sjust no give,”

Freshman Alegre Bussetti
thought that the mattresses were “as
hard as rocks" and that there was “ no
difference between sleeping on the
bed or the ﬂoor,”

According to Calllson, there are a
few people in Read who like the mate
Iresses and are planning to keep them.

“(The mattress) is stableand solid
and reliable," said freshman Elizae
bcth Mackey. “You‘re not going to
sink into it or down or anything I
was afraid at first whenl heard about
the mattresses because everyone told
me things, but when I actually slept
on it, it was nice.”

Admissions denies
increasing enrollment

By FREDRICK MANN

Assistant News Editor

VER since laslfall’sastound-
E ing 505 new student enrollr
menl. mmors have drifted
through campus about why the col-
lege enrollment had been so rapidly
increasing. Yesterday duringaphone
interview, Dean of Student, Torn
Crady said, “It is not true that the
college is trying to deliberately in—
crease the enrollment."
Crady explained that the college
relies on statistics to determine how

many students to admit each year.
Assistant Dean and Director of
Housing Oda Callison added, “It is
all a guessing game with statistics,
because we do not know exactly the
number of students who will return
and actuallyjoin Grinnell each year."
Last year the federal govemment
issued a new form for filing ﬁnancial
aid and the admission departments at
many colleges and universities expe-
rienced some sllght problems.
