The iive young men pictured above—who form the heart oi Grimell’s line from tackle to tackle—don’t usually get the publicity accorded to their
more conspicuous mates, but they are the players who have the job of opening holes far backs to run thraugh and protecting the Wise: with “lei! blocksa
This year's line has to be doubly good [or the tact that they have to give away as much as 20 or 30 pounds to opposing linemen and still move them out

Grinnell’s tootball team started its season at Monmouth
last Saturday and gave as poor an account of themselves as
this writer has scan in three years at this school. They tuni-
bled, they stumbled and the men who appeared to be playing
all out could be counted on the fingers of one hand.

*Tllel’e areprobably reasons for the Pioneers' showing. A
drenching rain soaked the field midway through the second
quarter, alter the lighting Scots had pushd over a touchdown
,and booted a iieldgoal, both on breaks which went against
Grinnell.

Coach Edd Bowers' charges were just starting their first
real push when the rains hit and made the ground muddy and
the ball slippery. As a result, neither team did much of any-
ing trom this point except for the touchdown Monmouth got alter
a shop from center slithered through a Grinnell punters lingers
and Monmouth took over fifteen yards tram the goal line.

Grinnell tumbled eight times in all with the wet ball, but
Monmouth played with the same ball and only bobblcd three
times. The Scots also got all their punts oil, while the Pio-
Eleers had three attempted kicks which never left the punters
out.

Grinnell‘s line had their troubles, particularly on defense,
where the heavier opposition beat them to the punch and push—
'ed them back on almost every play. On offense they did mans
age to open the holes most of the time, BuL those holes were
never gaping, and they closed quickly.

The vaunted passing attack accounted for just one comple—
tion, and Grinnell’s backtield could never supply any consistent
t rust.

These could all he that game errors—but first game errors
with a vengeance. Alter a losing season last year it would be
a poor habit to get into to laugh on the sort or game that the
opener was,

The question is not “Can Grinnell do it?" but “Wlll Grinhell
do it?" If the players on the 1960 football team were inferlol'
athlctcs, I wouldn't care how badly they pcrtormeo on the field:
but they are gitted performers, and it hurts when they are out
hustled.

Thy have the ability i believe. to finish well no in the
conlcrcnce. and if they'e out lor the sport callcd football,
that is what they might as well play.

Thc lM iootball season is on its
feet with four days of games
completed. There was only one
game or consequence this week,
and it resulted in a 13 to 6 loss
tor Smith in the hands of Raw-
son.

Rawson scored two quick
touchdowns and held on while
siiiith could only manage one
touchdown. South and nibble
won two games and thus jump—
ed into a lirst place tie while
Cowlcs, North and kawson
each won one game ‘and are.
in a tie tor third.

Gates defeated West Norris
for its iirst tootball victory in
thiee years but came back in
usual tashion by losing to South.
Geo. South gained its other via
tory by downing Langan, 7-0.

Dibble, being led by Gail
(family joke) Furnish and Roger
Miller, won easily over East Nor-

lis. 25-0, but had a little more

trouble defeating Clark, 12‘6.
