noaniAn interesting Talk.

One 0f the most Valuable advantages

i

enioyed by the present dir y college strur
dent, is not doun in the catalogue,
namely, the opportunity or experiene

ing’ the Alumni of the insbibubion.

Iowa College, or at least the iortunate
portion thereoi had such an "experi-
encing" last Sunday at Vespers and
the elicet was such as to maltc it con-
gratulatc itseli that it happened to be
lowa College and no other.

In spite orhisdiselaimer, Dr Shaw
had something very dciurite to sat.

and he chose the most altlllclive

or all methods to convey his message,
namely, a conrersonal discourse, about
real people,
aliby," \ the iniorming spirit or his
tallv. He brought the Fact home to
many a specialist in mar a varied
line or interest, that it is the moral
duty oi every individual “to make the
most of himself” as the old phrase has
it, sell-culture, not merely in regard to
the physical basis oi lire, not merely
in connection with his ”life-work,” as
the small province of human activity
wherein each person is engaged is
called, but a self-culture that is as
wideinsynrpatln and intelligent inter-
est, it' not in impossible actual attain-
ment, as the sane human personality
has iaculti . desires or aspirations
l-lis ~pecrtic injunction was. ”Cultivate
certain interests not practically Cour
nected with your work.” Tire most
telling “practical" argument in later
of his positron was the example or
Theodore Roosevelt.
