Appearance.

An unusual number 01' passengers,

for Ewart. delayed the ti in on which
the Girl’s Glee Club was chi-onto to
Montezuma to give a concert last
night, and as a result the program
did not begin till 17:45, due to thc
obstinaoy of tho conductor, who felt
that he should treat all passengers
with ccnai respect, especially those
travcling iii a private car. The delay
caused by so many getting off the
train, threw the train a little behind
schedule, which is unusual.

The passengers which had the car
of their own were of thc four—legged
variety. and were on their way to
the farmyards of Ewart and vicinity.
