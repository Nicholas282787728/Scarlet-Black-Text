MOUNT VERNON, Iowa—i
Whether or not Col‘llell’s‘
football team 11' its stride
under the inspll tion of the
Coe-Cornell tradition last Sate
urday, or whether the Purple
played over its head, is the
question being asked here
this week.

Rough Edges Smoother].

Cornell coaches have claimed
since earli in the season that
when the rough edges due to in-
expericncs were worked off of
their team‘s game. that the
eleven would show a, great deal of
power in the line and would pack
a definite wallop on offense. in
other woids, Cornell last Saturday
played as it had been claimed they
should be able to play once they
got some experience,

It is the general opinion here
that if they played as they did
against Coe. Cornell could defeat
any team in the conference. In
the backfield, not only did little
Gene Tomqiiist play havoc with
the Coe offense, but three other
backs played an outstanding game
on both offense and defense.
Cornell's air attack showed some

. strength or the first time mi:
season, but the plays
showed unusual drive on the part
of the runners and excellent block~
ing by the interference, Earl
Rodine’, the running half-back, and
Paul (Bounder) Roberts, the
blocking half, both sophomores,
played outstanding football. Quene
tin Joy, the junior fullback, smash-
ed the Coe line with powerful
drives and played great defensive
ball. All three of these men
started the season handicapped by
inexperience.

spot this season suddenly became
one of the toughest parts of the
forward wall on Saturday. Dave
Hoare, Vetel‘i’dll senior, filled the
berth playing the greatest game
or his three years of varsity come
petition

There were no Cornell injuries
in the game and the Purple are
expected to be in top shape for
tomorrow's game with Grinnell.

morrow, his speed has been dan-
gerously hampered.

As a result of this handicap,
Douglas has been whipping a new
tcztm into shape for this game,
Tod Kelilieflck's outstanding per-
formance against Waslihurn has
earned him his start at left end
Art Werlein, who is replacing
Dewitt at center in the starting
lineup, has prove}! that he can
handle his berth very well George
Bishop is another new man in the
lineup. He will be started at right
tackle. The long practices that
Douglas and his assistant, Oliver
Wagner, have been holding this
week are indicative of the tact
that the Pioneers are going to be
in tip-top condition for Cornell,
Tomorrow’s contest should hring
Grinnelrs conference wins to three
straight.
