Friedman explains ‘touchstones’ s

by Dave Wick

Last Sunday and Monday nights,
Maurice Friedman presented the
1976 Gates Lectures which can
tered primarily on his two books
“The Human Image" and
“Touchstones of Reality” and the
relation oi the theologian Martin
Buber to the ideas in these two
books.

On Sunday night, Friedman
defined his “touchstones” as some
experience that a person has had in
the past and how it aliects who one
is at present. He cited the example
of how the Jews were freed from
Egypt and every year they corn-
memorate that event. In this Way,
Friedman said, they have related
the past to the present. ’

Friedman alsospoke of “modern
Jobs” who were people who
rebelled against injustices yet
remained non-destructive These
people rebel within the guidelines
oi the system.

One oi Friedman’s gcncral
thoughts concerned his feeling that
people weren't opening up to each
other enough. He expressed the
opinion that it is just as important
to understand the Views oiothers in
order to supplement nne's own
personal view. Friedman stated
that one of the consequences of
inhumanity was godlessness.
