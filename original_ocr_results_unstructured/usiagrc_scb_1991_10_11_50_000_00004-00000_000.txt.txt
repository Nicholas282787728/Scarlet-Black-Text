Coming Out Day increases
campus gay/ bisexual Visibility

 

By Julie Gard

“It’sbasicallyanawarenessthing,“
stated Greg Vincent. “An imponant
purpose of Coming Out Day is to
increase gay/bisexual visibility on
campus and throughout thecountry."

Along witlt other members of
Grinnell Community to End
Homophobia (GCEH) and Grinnell
Queers (GQ), Vincent has organized
today'scampusactivitiescorrespondr
ing to national Coming Out Day.

Vincent stressed that“the only way
[gay/bisexual] issues will be ad-
dressed is if we come out publicly.
Otherwise, we’re just another invis-
ible minority" He said national sta-
tistics illustrate the group‘s potential
for influence, explaining that if all
homosexuals in the United States
came out of tire closet, 70% of the
population would be impacted.

Citing a campus-wide poll taken
lastyearin which 15% oftheoversOO
respondents were gay, lesbian or bi
sexual, Vincent said. “We're the larg-
est minority group on campus. We‘d
like to have a louder voice, a bigger
say in things"

An important role of Coming Out
Day is to encourage individuals to

on campus.

“Grinnell is a good place to come
out; it's a very positive
atmosphere. , .My own experience has

Mortar Board promotes service

By Alison Wade

thnlcnnifer Mattcm was nomi-
nated lastsemestcr to become a meme
ber of the Grinnell chapter of Mortar
Board, a national senior honor soci-
ety, she became confused.

“I didn't even know Grinnell had
an honor society," she claimed, “and
I certainly didn’t know that Mortar
Board was any such organization."

Like many members of thc

- Grinnell campus, she knew ofMortar

Board only through the occasional
coffee hour sponsored by the group.
“You see those signs for the coffee
hours so often,” she remarked, “so
thatbyjuniorycarit'salmostasifyou

», riously that there are many on this

Greg Vincent, above, believes
the gay/bisexual community at
Grinnell needs to be more vocal,

any negative reactions from friends.
I'm much happier for [having come
out],‘ said Vincent.

He adds, however, that“one of the
hardest things to deal with at
Grinnell,, . [is that] there’s a large gay
population, but it‘s pretty much clos-
eted." Coming Out Day is aimed at
combating thatproblem , said Vincent,
”We're trying to inspire people to be
more active.“

National Coming Out Day com-
memorates a milestone for visibility
and pride in the gay community. To-
day marks the fourth anniversary of
the 1987 March on Washington for
Gay and Lesbian Rights.

Vincent described the day‘s uni
derlying purpose as making people
realize that ”we‘re everywhere, in
every profession, We’re professional
football players; we’re their brothers
and sisters, sometimes their parents:
and we wantthcm to know that we are
equal to them in every respect.”

campus whose familiarity with the
group runs deeper than that."

Mortar Board is, however, a dis-
tinguished honor society, with duties
as varied as its members, According
to Tolan Steele, this year’s Mortar
Board president, members are cho-
sen according to three basic prin»
ciples: “scholarship, leadership. and
service“. Although scholarship is
judged by grade point average, there
is a great deal of ﬂexibility in the
manifestation ofthe other two ideals:
students must simply demonstrate
considerable campus involvement,

Jen Kern, executive member of
Mortar Board, believes that the
strength of this flexibility is that it
“brings together all kinds of people
who are already involved with di-
verse campus organizations. The re-
sources for the group are then just
amazing, and the people are varied
and really great."

Although Mortar Board is a na
Lional organization. the Grinnell chap-
ter, according to Steele, has been
“more locally oriented.“

“Wedon'tputalargecmphasison
the prestige of a national honor soci-
ety," he said.

Kris Hauser, who traveled to the
nationalmortarboardconfcrencehcld
thisJulyinAtlanta,agreeswithStecle.
Although she believes the national

 

aspectof the organization is an excelr
lentmeansof“sharingdiffcrentcam-
puses‘ experiences with Mortar
Board,” Hauser views the Grinnell
chapterasbeing,asMattemdescribcs,
“focused on the Grinnell community

first and foremost.”

This, perhaps, is one reason that
many Grinnell students don’t know
aboutthe group. As Kern puts it,“We
don't want recognition, we don’t
emphasize the honors aspect of the
organization. Wetust emphasize our
role, which we see as being largely
service oriented."

Although the low profile of the
organization may be a good means of
maintaining Grinnell's egalitarian
atmosphere, many members ex-
pressed concern that not enough
Grinnell students are aware of the
service projects sponsored by Mortar
Board, and, hence, are not becoming
involved with them

It’s not a prestigious
elitist organization;
rather, it’s a nifty little
organization for people
who are concerned with
community service.

Board member

projects are accessible to them.

explaining that this process “ultiA

And what of those coffee hours

Students with specific ideas for cof-

they're just a good means [0 keep in

Although “senior honor society"
mayconnoteimagcsofelitism,memr
bers stress that the organization does
not simply serve as a paton the back
for those chosen. Instead, the organi-
zation ﬁts well within the college
community because of its focus on
contnbuting,onworkingforthecom-
munity. In many ways, it serves to
harness the diverse range of ideas
found at Grinnell andput them to use
in constructive ways. Although this
may result in a lower campus profile,
many feel that this is in some ways
beneﬁcial to the organization.
