T is with some tear that we follow
the custom of issuing a Woman’s
Edition of SCARLET AND BLACK. as
suggested last year, because no one re«
alizes better than do we what a high
standard last year's edition set,

But we cannot refrain lrom using
this opportunity which .has so gener-
ously been olIered us. We hope no
comparisons will be made, lor remem-
ber comparisons are odious,

This the oiie opportunity in the year
when, the girls can sit) that which per-
haps they have wanted to say ever
since school began in the fail, or per-
linps ever since those things which
were shill liliti yelu' were iotgohtell,

We hope thisidea or a Woman’s Edi-
tion will never die out, so long as the
Scanner asp BL lCK issues a niinilier
anti we wish that there were more op»
portuuities for the girls to do their
share.

The Board wishes to expressl
itude tor the aid given by those who
are and have oeeii so closely connected
with Iowa Collelze. Tll r ass. taiiee
has made this edi n possible. Also

given by the merchants oi G 'nncil.

while the school is lioildiiis its liest

Let us suggest, also that students
are too partial to the letter Y, which
invariably- appears at the beginning of
each recitation. and is a great com-
fort, we confess, when 0116 has noth-

savor of High School, tor the good or

ones, and most or them show their ap-

the new girls early in the year; out is
it any wonder that beyond this step
little is accomplished, when the great
major . or the younger girls discuur~
age all further advances on the part
of tho iippcrclasswomeu by failing to
return their calls? This is doubtless
through carelessness; they are taliea

ests, as they should lie largely, but the
and they, perhaps
more than we, are losing something
by not entering into larger interests,
and in this tact is their discontent to
be partially c ilained.

NE of the things on which Iowa
College pritles itself is its demOA
cratic spill itllﬂl: it ilirnislics equal
opportunities ior culture and advance-
ment to evei tlltleut. With regard
to most phases at college life this is
LIL|67Llle opportunities ollered are
equal, though some students improve
them more than others. There is one
place, liowei er. where the girls of the
[college do not have equal chances
and that is in the literary societies.
Grllinell has two girls' societies, each
with a nieinhei-sliipliooit oi lifty, tor
~ tliree liundretl gii - There
ale always many girls who wish to tlo
literary society worlr. and who would
be valued members or either society,
who are unable to become members

who has been iortilnate enough to be-
long to either lallis or Calocagathia

the social 13‘ -t or society life It does
not seem run that these advantages
should be restricted to alillndred girls.
There is urgent need ola tliild society
[or girls, Lo give those who are not
new members or a society a chance to
participatein socie - work. There is
no reason why another society should
not he organi ediwe have an abuudr
:tnce cl material among the girls of the
college to mukeastrong and active
society in a very short time. The only
obstacle seems to be than no one will
take the trouble to initiate the move»
rnelit. Once started, there could heno
doubt or its success H the girlswould
take hold or this question. and work
enthusiastically for a time, we might
easily haveathivd glrls’ society, and
give a chalice for literary work to
many girls who are at presentdeprlved
