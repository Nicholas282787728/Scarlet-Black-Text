The “Ill-Zone"

where

cigarettes
are iudged

The 'T-ZONE”—Taste and Throat—is (he
proving ground for cigarettes. Only your
taste and throat can decide which cigatene
tastes best (a you . . . and how it affects your
throat. For your Taste and throat are abso-
lutely individual :0 yum Based on (he expe-
rience of millions of smokels, we believe
Camels will suit your “T-ZONE” to a ‘T.’
Prove it for youxself!
