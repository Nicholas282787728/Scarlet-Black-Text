Quest1ons on portfol o raised

Students assail investment ties to South Africa here

By Julie Brand

Two Grinnell students have
begun efforts to determine how
much stock the college owns in
corporations tied to the Union of
South Africa with the objective of
encouraging this school to take
action against that nation’s policy
of racial separation.

Jim Stuart and SGA President
Jon Neiderbach are both looking
into the possibilities oi examining
the college security portfolio.

THEY AIM to persuade the
Board of Trustees to make a
shareholders resolution mandating
corporate withdrawal from South

Africa. One of their immediate
concerns is to form a committee
for investment responsibility,
comprised of students, faculty and
administrators.

Stuart met Wednesday With
College President Richard Turner
to discuss this issue. Stuart felt
that Turner was “real sympathetic
and was glad to see someone
working on it” Stuart also said
that ”the President was planning
to speak about shareholder’s
resolutions at the Board of
Trustees meeting."

PRIOR TO his meeting Wiﬂl
Turner. Stuart had written College
treasurer Robert Anderson in an

effort to determine how much
stock the college owns in cor-
porations which have facilities in
or do business With the Union of
South Atrica. On September 4,
Stuart sent Anderson a letter which
contained a list of 51 corporations
and institutions that have different
degrees of involvement in the
South African economy.

Also in this letter, Stuart asked
for information concerning several
topic areas. He inquired about the
market value of Grinnell’s stock in
these corporations as well as
“Grinnell's policy on shareholder’s
resolutions mandating corporate
withdrawal from South Africa.”

KDIC signs on with new program

schedule; seeks varied

By Marikay Kameclura

KDIC, Grinnell College's student
operated radio station, has begun

its 1977-78 broadcast year With a
wide-ranging program schedule
and an increase in the number of
potential on-theair personalities.

This year there will be regularly
scheduled programming on KDIC
for the first time. In general, the
programs will reflect the liberality
of the college. Tapes by Pacifica, a
non-proiit, left wing organization
based in Los Angeles, will provide
social and political commentary.
“Radio Nederland," a highly
acclaimed program from the
Netherlands, will give Grinnell
students a European view of
issues, “In Black America” will
deal With black issuﬁ, culture and
politics in both the United States
and Africa. Beginning in October,
”BBC Science Magazine” Will be
presented on KDIC. It will feature
interviews and discussions with
noted scientists.

THE STATION will have SGA
President Jon Neiderbach answer
questions on a bimonthly callsin
show. A series of lectures from the
University of Chicago, various
musical programs, Iowa cultural
events, and a women’s program
are also on KDIC’s agenda

DUE TO new FCC guidelines the
station must also respond to the
needs of the Grinnell community
as well as to those of the college.
Programs on the school system
and problems such as vandalism
will be heard on KDIC oc-
casionally.

The KDIC news department is
headed by senior Ben Spiegel. The
main newscast is 15 minutes long
and is heard at 11 o'clock. Spot
news summaries off the AP wires
are a new addition this year. They

heard principally in the early
morning.

THE KDIC DJs cater to the
diverse interests represented at
Grinnell College. The staff realizes
that it is important to air the in-
terests of smaller groups such as
classical music or hard rock. The
primary emphasis, however, will
be on folk music. progressive rock,
and Jazz, The staff would like the
music selection to be aesthetically
pleasing. For example, hard rock
is not being played during early
morning hours, ,

Potential DJs must submit a
sample program that is 30 to 60
minutes long, No one is allowed on
air without a license from the
Federal Communications Com-
mission. KDIC has taken ad
vantage of rules that make the
license requirements more simple.
Now it only takes a few hours to
study for the test which is come

licensed people on campus last
year as compared to this year‘s 75.
Another 20 have applied for
licenses and Station Manager Kurt
Anderson hopes the total will reach
100. He expects 20 per cent oi these
to be women. This is three times
as many women as last year.

Program Director Steve Brull
said KDIC is better now than it was
at the same time last year. He
thinks this is probably because
there were not as many seniors
among last year’s DJ’s and
because the station has improved
as its on air personalities have
gained experience.

Anderson and Brull estimate
that half the student body listens to
KDIC at one time or another.

He also asked if there is ”any term
of a committee ior'investment
responsibility and, if so, who IS on
the committee?”

THE LIST of corporations he
sent to Anderson included many of
the socalled blue chip stocks,
which are generally recognized as
the safest long-term investments
which can be made. Among those
Stuart listed were: American
Express, Bank of America, Boeing
Corp, Chase Manhattan Bank.
Chrysler, Eastman Kodak, E.I,
Du Pont. Exxon, Ford Motor Co.,
General Electric, General Motors,
IBM, lT'l‘, Mobil Oil, Polaroid,
Shell Oil. Sperry Rand, Standard
Oil of California, Texaco, Union
Carbide, Westinghouse and Xerox.

Stuart’s eiiorts are being cons
ducted With the assistance of two
west coast student groups. One of
these groups, Campuses United
Against Apartheid, is a California
organization which opposes
America’s economic and political
involvement with the South
African and Rhodesian‘governs
ments. The other group is a
Stanford-based organization
known as the Stanford Committee
for Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP),

IN CALLING for the Board of
Trustees of Stanford to vote for
these proxy resolutions, SCRIP
cited many arguments which
favored the withdrawal of
American companies, These
arguments appeared in a forty-
page position paper presented to
the Trustees.

“American and other foreign
investors in South Africa are
important in several respects: the
general economic scene (balance
of trade, capital flow, investment,
etc ). technical assistance to the
apartheid regime. supporting the
military and the police, providing
energy needs, especially in the
cases of oil and nuclear power,
social and political legitimlzation
and commitment,” the paper said,

NEIDERBACII was originally
interested in the college's role in
human rights without any
knowledge of Stuart's actions. He
posed a question about the in-
vestment issue to Ed Mezvinsky
when the former congressman
spoke here September 8. He did
this not only to discover Mez-
vinsky’s position but to “bring the
issue up to the campus come
munity." Neiderbach was in

and was impressed by the
statewide student activity there.
He said, “If there is any issue that
will become a major political issue
throughout the college campuses in
this country this fall, it will be this
He also stated that he
thought there would be “a great
deal of support at Grinnell from
students, the community and the
SGA.”

Turner admitted prior to his
Wednesday meeting with Stuart
that the College does own some
stock in corporations tied to the
Union of South Africa, notably in
the Ford Motor Co. He made three
main points about college holdings
and South Africa,

“FIRST OF all, we are invested
in roughly iso diiierent companies
and corporations. The second idea
is a supposition that in such a
diversified portfolio. which has a
number of large multinational
corporations. inevitably there is
high involvement in South Africa.
This would be true of any divers
sified portfolio. This is easy to
imagine since there are 350 sot»
sidiaries in South Africa.

“The third fact is this: there are
approximately 15 challenges
regarding South African com~
panies—that is, American coma
panies with activity in South
Africa. Of those 15, we are involved
in six of those companies. In each
one of those six, the operation in
South Africa is very minor but
it's there. Of our investments
in those six companies, between no
and 90 per cent 0t those are in the
Ford Motor Company.

”BEFORE THIS issue was
raised, 1 investigated the Ford
Motor Company in South Africa in
terms of its practices And its
practices appear to be very good.
It’s joined with 11 other major
companies who all have similiar
arrangements of nonssegregation,
equal pay for equal work, training
programs, replacement of retired
high positioned Whites by blacks,
housing programs and all that."

Although he expressed a
willingness to explore the issue of
proxy voting with the Board of
Trustees, he rejected the idea that
the College should divest itself of
its holdings which are tied to South
Africa.

One reason tor his opposition to
divestiture, Turner said, is that “If
you really got serious about
(divestiture) you’d have no ports
folio leftl”
