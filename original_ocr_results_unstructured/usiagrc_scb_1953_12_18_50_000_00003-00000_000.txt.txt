Flooded Sou’rh Campus Courfs

Weather permitting, the ten«
his court on south campus
which last year was llooded and
lrozen lor a skating rink will
be flooded for a rink again this
year, Norman Marble, buildings
and grounds superintendent. an»

, nounced this week.

“It's got, to be mighty cold
helore we’ll even attempt the
flooding process," he said. He
explained that last year's oper-
ation involved a great expense
with little satisfactory result.
Marble was dubious about the
future of skating rinks at Grin-
nel‘l her two reasons. irst, he
said. it was very difficult to
flood the court, because while
the cold nights froze the ice
solid, the days usually melted
the ice. Also when the water is

poured onto the court, he said‘,
it is at a temperature of so
degrees and unless the land is
very solid, it seeps into the
earth.

Marble also questioned the
appreciation or the rink by
the students. ”It's a lot of
work arid it takes a lot of
money to set up a rink and
then have nobody use it," he
said.

“The rink is put there for the
use of the college students, and
unless they make use of it, it
hardly seems worth the trouble.
Unless it proves to be worth-
while, the act will not be exer»
cised in the future," he con-
eluded.
