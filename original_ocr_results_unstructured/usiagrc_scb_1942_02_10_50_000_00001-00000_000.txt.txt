Stevens Forecasts Food Shortage in Near Future

By Allen Arney

A food sllolmtzlge, which‘ will biing
the W211 home," is inevitable ill the
new future, acco1ding to Samuel N
Stevens, llho has received many bul-
letius from Cdundlies in the West
and floni sections of the Middle

' west.

Bulletins from Washington fish cane
narics icport that lunarfish, salmon, sdr-

dmcs, and other edible fish will not be
canned this your, becousc of submoiinc
danger to fishing Crews, and the fact
that most of thc fishing crews are Japan-
cse. The government will get any fish
that is canned anyway, the reports show.

other reports show that because of
mother condition this wintl-r only 315%
of tho toiviiito crop, 40% of the pest
crop, and 30% of the corn crop will be
produced in thc \Vcst.

Only 3% of the bean crop is to be pro-
duced there because of the difficulty in
gctting pickers, and those obtainable are
demanding in a double salary.

In Michigan the peach crop has been
severely reduced by winter conditions.

Grinnell college is well stocked
with food for this semester and

next summer, but lifter that time
it is questionable as to how much

food the college wiH be able to ob
tain, Stevens said.

“What food we have on hand we
are going to conserve, as we will be
unable ta get it again,” he stated.
“Conservation must be practiced by
all Stllddﬂtsr They will have to be
patient with the simpler meals they
will receive, but they will still get
plenty to eat."

Pearce was cleared by the pub-
lications board in regard to the
Zephyr books, the boa-rd finding
everything in order.

The board also postponed ac-
tion on official approval of the
Scarlet and Black account books
as kept by Ray 0. Gustafson, who
also recently left his campus post
to join the armed forces.

The board gave as the reason
for its failure to approve Gustafe
son’s records the explanation that
they were not kept in sufficient
detail.

As a result, any transcript of
credits or official honorable dis-
charge from Grinncll which Gus-
tafson might wish to secure will
be hold up until he is cleared by
