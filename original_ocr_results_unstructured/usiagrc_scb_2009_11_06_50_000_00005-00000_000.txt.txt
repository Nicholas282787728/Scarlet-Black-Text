Musical cellaboration adds
to Silent Films Festival

musical student groups around campus,

The musical styles fall under a broad range, including
jazz improvisation, original classical compositions, percus-
sion arrangements and compositions by Freesound. The
idea for the festival came from Terri Geller, English, who
suggested to the Cultural Films Committee that a num—
ber of short ﬁlms should be shown in Faulconer Gallery.

Phillippe Moisan, Associate Professor of French, who
is a member of the Cultural Films Committee, thought
the festival, which will show roughly 15 shorts presented
chronologically, was a change otdirection for how cultural
ﬁlms were being presented at Grinnell College.

The majority orthe ﬁlms are from the twenties and for
ties, the earliest dating all the way back to 1894, all ofthem
originally silent. “You can find DVDs [or] these ﬁlms but
it’s hit or miss, the music can be terrible because producers
pick the music and it doesn't match," Moisnntsaid. “The
music [in this festival] is very interpretive and it's going to
give you ways to analyze the trim,"

Earlier this semester, the CFC contacted the Music De
partment, which
showed interest
in the ﬁlm project
and commissioned
six or seven music
students to create
compositions.

In addition to
the Music Departs
ment’s musical cone
tributions, studentrrun Freesound is also collaborating in
the event, through the connection ofMike Kober ’10. One
orthe organizers ofFreesound, Kober also happens to be in
Geller's Film Analysis class.

"This is Theresa Geller's idea. She reached out to ev-
erybody, The [ﬁlms] are all deﬁnitively avant—garde.This is
the next step of the Cultural Films Studies and it’s avantr
garde ﬁlms,” Kober saidThe musical accompaniment will
range from scores written by Frcesound's various bands, in
cluding Randy Brush's drum collective, as well as a percuSr
sion duo and jazz composition.

With some suggestions from Geller in terms of mur
sical direction, Freesourid has developed some artistically
creative ideas on how to cover the shorts, “It’s going to be
lots of different kinds of performances, The fact that it's
so interpretive and interactive will be really interesting,"
Kobet said. ‘We re trying to get the audience into the per
formance.”

Last year, when rap legend GZA, founding member of
The Wu-Tang Clan. performed at the Harris Center, he
seemed lethargic. He half mumbled classic lines while his hype
men swarmed around him, jumping excitedly as they waited
to for their turn to spit just one terse, His lack of enthusiasm
may have been caused by the Harris Centers abilityto dwarfa
reasonably large crowd by Grim-tell concert’s standards.

Hopcﬁilly, when underground hiprhop artist Kool Keith,
real name KeithThomton, takes the stage in the comparatively
cramped Gardner Lounge this Friday, Nov 6 at 9: on p m, he
will be as encouraged by the' intimate setting as much as GZA
was disappointed by Harris’ empty space.

The two emcees share more than performing at Grinneil,
Both released classic records only six months apart in the mid—
nineties, GZA with “Liquid Swords,” and Keith with "Dr.
Octagonecologys t ” Keiths surrealistic lyrics mixed with RZA
inspired beats are still echoin through the industry today. If
GZA' is 61an the Genius, en Keith should be called the
Inﬂuence.

Initially, Keith had no stylistic peers, now his content and
characteristics have become industry trends Keith was rapping
about bring an alien long before Lil Wayne and Andre 3000
were citing their supposed extraterrestrial presence Similarly,
the recent use orrecal wordplayin hiphop can most immedi- ,
ately be traced to Wayne, but look further back and yet again,
Keith' is the source Before MFDoorn donned multip 1e mm,
kers, Thornton had already released albums under Pthe artist
names ‘Dr. Octagon,“Kool Keith"and “Dr. Dooom”

Regardless of his place in rap history, recently Keith has

aged worse than almost anyone in the industry. Clearly trying
to aIgshalte his most critically acclaimed alias, twice Thomton has
released songs under DrsDooom, himself, where he kills Dr.
Octagon, also himself, The Return of Dc Octagon, released
in 2006, was ﬁlled with spoken word and rants, mixed in with
rapping. His most recent album, "Bikirus NT'hongs gs, released
on Oct. 13, settles in his category of albums clearly inspired
by his libido While still far ﬁom his highest quality work, it
is good to see Keith sticking to tap Keith is best when he ties
seemingly haphazard verses together, something he does only
sporadically' in later work

This all leaves the quality of Thornton's omlance in
jeopardyﬁs' it is very reliant on the set list he menses and what
mix ofold and new it brings Yet, on a Friday nightin Gnnnell,
when the Velvet Underground of rap'comes, you owe it to .
yourself to see a pioneer of industry perform This' is not to
guarantee abad show ,just to mici te the hype. 0 take a garn—
ble, and come watch one cool edoctor the microphone.

King Corn achieves corniness, not meaning

BY CoLiN CARR

Aaron Wolf ’5 “King Com” very much
wants to be the exciting culmination ofvarir
ous cultural developments in the last decade.
It’s an expose about the corn and meat indust
tries at a time in which the “vote with ,your
fork" sensibility has become crucial to our
sumval. Works like “Supersize Me," "Fast
Food Nation,” and “Food Inc." have exposed
more than the insidiousness ofour largetscale
toad suppliers—they have taught Americans
that our dietary and consumer choices have
profound social, ﬁnancial and environmental
ramiﬁcations. From the unsanitary conditions
that cows are raised in to the 70 percent of
our national antibiotic expenses that goes into
keeping them alive in such squalor, these jour-
nalistic investigations have demonstrated that
our nation’s gluttony has consequences far be-
yond our waistlines.

one can see why a young documentarian
like Wolf would want to explore these issues.

Less admirable is his desire to capitalize on
another popvculture development, specifically
tied to documentary ﬁlms—namely the use of
the funny, everyman narrator, uncovering the
hypocrisies in American life without getting
too puffed up about it (think Michael Moore).
Here instead of a lone renegade, we have two
Bostonian besties, Ian Cheney and curt Ellis,
who are both mannishly handsome but share
a wgue aura of gooancss that makes you feel
like they should he more amusing than they
are.

The premise is simple: as these two aver
age 1065, upon realizing how mllch of their
average-joc diets consists ofcornibe ithighr
fructose corn syrup or the corn that goes into
raising their beefimove out to lowa and
start growing an acre or their own com. This
narrative gimmick allows them to talk about
various issues connected to the corn industry
without seeming structurally messy,

The ﬁlm takes great strains to emphasize

just how irreverent this plan is.We get Cheney
talking on his cell to one ofhis more conven-
tional friends: “Yeah, we’re moving from Bos-
ton to Iowa.We're gonna raise an acre ofcorn,
see what happens,” But what about you?
How's your high paying job?” Even more bla-
tantly artiﬁcial is the shot of an lmwm farmer
reading a letter from Ellis and Cheney about
their plan to come visit his farm, making the
viewer quickly wonder how there’s already a
cameraman at the farm to view this reading.
These indulgences may seem pretty innoc-
uous, and many of them are, but their cumula-
tive street is to weaken any sense of political
or moral indignation one would expect from
the matters at hand.The film throws together
a decent sum ofint'ormation regarding the ca-
tastrophes the meat and corn industries per-
petuate, yet it seems afraid to organize all this
material into a unified, charged statement.
Our two protagonists want so clearly to be af-
fable that they skirt the obvious fact that the

story they’re trying to tell simply demands a
more emotional engagement. They can only
play it cool for so long before the act seems
underwhelming and perhaps even irrespon»
sible.

The best book I’ve encountered on the
food industry is Michael Pollan’s “The Om-
nivore's Dilemma." Pollan discusses in great
depth the rise of massive corn monocultures
in place of the family farm and the seems
ingly endless cultural metastasis that has re
sulted from this revolution. The author does
not need to ‘play’ charming everyman because
he is charming—and gracefully funny. And
yet he is not afraid to probe on an emotional
and almost spiritual level into the question of
what our relationship to the food on our plate
should be. That book presented a uniﬁed and
expanding experience, “King Corn," instead,
presents a smattering of interesting data, di—
luted by tacky gags and childish manipula—
