For a group of four college boys at
Grinneil, the kitchen ofthe Haines First co-
op is surprisingly elean. “Should we tell her
that other people clean ir>"said Kyle Lynthe
Klarup '10.

“Yeah," said Brad Bishop '08. “We have
friends from North Campus who come in
here and cook and clean up.”

The foursome,which also includes Adam
Wert and Jacques Nguyen, both '10, keep a
strictly openrdoor policy, and ﬂoorrmates
and friends ﬂow in and out, “I came in to
an empty room last week and was shocked,"
said Lyncli»K_lrIrup.

tended to be a siiigle.“lt’s been ﬁne though;
we don't feel claustrophobic," said ‘Lynchr
Klarup. “We all have our own workspace."

They would like to hold on to their home
next year, but Bishop, who will be graduat-
ing, said, “Without a senior it will be hard
for them to get a ca-op next year."

. Their paradise was a hit ofa iixenupper,
however. “We've deﬁnitely had to do some
upkeep,"said Bishop. “We put in a new ven-
tilation fan.”

“When he said ‘us’,”
Klnzup, “he means ‘Brad.'"

"He doesn't root his own horn,"
Wcrr, “so we do it for him."

After a moment ofsilence, Lynch»KlrIrup
said, “Should we tell them about the mouse
wars?"

“No!"said Bishop, “I hid the mouserraps
and I‘ll take them out again after the report-
er leaves,"

 

The guys love that their roomy aparte - .

mentrstyle housing has become a gathering
place for the Bible study gloup, a drum eirele,
weeklyThursdaynightdinnersand occasion-
al movie nights. Last semester they checked
out a multimedia projector and played a
double feature of Mystery Men and The
Lion King, as well as a Hell Week “Mind-

light of
last sc-
mesrer’s
husy social calendar was a Christmas cookie
baking party that boasted an attendance
of 50 to 60 students. “We made over 1300
eookies," said Bishop.

“1369,” corrected Wert. They also plan
on starting an interfaith discussion group
that Wcrr said will address “why there is a
need for God and the nature of God."

Bishop and Wert starred covering the
Co-op last year, when they decided that they
wanted “a central place for Bible study on
Campus." Lynch~Klarup joined in_as they
started seriously considering the comp. and
Nguyen said he got “pulled in at the end."
“Jacques is the sexy factor," said Bishop.

"Yeah, he has a tattoo,” said Lynch-
Klirup.

Despite the Star Wars and Lord of the
Rings movie posters seartetcd over the walls.
the Co-op feels more like your grandma’s
apartment than it does like a south campus
dorm room. During introductions, Bishop
offers “fresh, home-made banana bread",
and on the rack board outside their door
hangs a bug of candy with a Sign reading,
"Help yourstln Jesus loves youl"ln the living
room there is a huge mural ofa tiee painted
by Lynch l<lurup, and world maps decorate
the hall outside their rooms.
