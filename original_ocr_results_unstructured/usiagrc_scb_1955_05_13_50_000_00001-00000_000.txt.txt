Religion Board Conducl's Drive
To Collecl' Tex’rs For Korea

A drive to collect used text books ’to be sent to Korea
will be conducted by the Boald of Religion duling final
exam week, plesident George Allan stated Monday

Cardboard cartons in which to place the books will be
located in each of the halls and in ARH from May 23 30,
Allan said, The Board of Religion will wrap the books and
pay for their transportation to Korea.

The purpose of this drive, he
said, is to help meet the urgent
need in Korean colleges for text
and reference books, Lectures
are the only method of instruc-
tion because of the lack of text
and reference books. Since the
study of English is _now required
of all Korean students, beginning
in the first year of junior high
school, books.written in English
are oi extreme value to stu—
dents and professors.

All hooks in current use in
college courses will he wel-
comed. Fields in which the
need is especially great include
science, history, political
science, economics, English
and American literature, art,
and music. The books should
he in fairly sound condition,
with a minimum of markings.

That education has suffered
greatly as a result of the Come
munist invasion was evidenced
by a recent study, in which it
was revealed that 25 per cent of
classrooms and school buildings
were wholly or partially de-
stroyed; that more than half of
all teachers and professors were
killed or captured by the Com—
mun' ts; and that almost all the
lacilities and equipment—induci-
ing libraries—were completely
destroyed.

dians, who are happy until
famine strikes and their
streams dry up, causing the
game and fish to die. After
praying for rain without re.
sults, the Indian chiefs form a
council fire (0 decide what to
do.

Finally a warrior is sent to
the land of the evil one Where
he discovers that Wojuli, the
God of Ice and Storm, is the
cause of the Indians’ misery.

When Wojun is overcome by
the Sun God through the pray-
ers of the lndians, the melted
ice from the throne of the ice
god forms the Mississippi river.

SC Plans Revision
For Constitution

The Student Council last night
accepted a revised constitution
as presented' by Ken Kasse-
baum, council president. The
constitution will be presented to
students next Monday night for
approval at housemeetings‘.

According to Kassebaum, “the
new constitution has not chang-
ed the structure of student gov-
ernment. Basically it is the same
constitution. It has merely clar»
ified areas which in the past
have been hazy and made
changes necessitated by the fac-
ulty reorganization."

If approved by a majority of
the students, the constitution
will go to the faculty for final
approval.

The main innovation in the
constitution is a provision for
by-laws. This will make it pos—
sible to make minor changes in
council duties and procedures
without requiring an amendment
to the constitution.
