the college. The value of the estate
was not estimated.

‘the time of his death, was an Iowa
pioneer, a son of the Rev. James

Russell Known
as Irish Critic,
Writer, Painter

Poet Brought to Grinnell
on Second American

Lecture Tour

George w Russell, Ireland’s AE,
will speak in Herrick chapel. Wednes-
day night as a part of the Grinnell
college lecture course. AE is making
his second American tour.
Mr Russell is well known as a pain-
,tel‘, poet. economist, critic, and phi!»
osopher. He was born in Ireland in
1867, and received his early schooling
not far from London. After studying
at the Dublin School of Art, he decided
to be a painter, but he was obliged
to give this up for his family was
poor. He went to work in an account—
ing ofﬁce and there he began to write
his poems.

AE Means “Aeon”
It was at this time that Russell
became AB. He had taken as a
pseudonym the name Aeon. This he
signed at the end of his poems, but
the typesetters on the papers to
which be contributed his poems could
decipher only the ﬁrst two letters,
AE. Many thought this meant "agri-
cultural economist."

Besides writing poetry AE, the
economist, is interested in the coop-
erative farm movement in Ireland.
Some of his early poems fell into the
hands of Sir Horace Plunkett, presl~
dent of the Irish Agricultural society,
and the latter made AE an organizer
for the society in the belief that any-
one who could expound the “Bhaga-
vad Gita" could explain agricultural
cooperation. Several years later AE
became assistant secretary to the so—
ciety, and in 1905, editor of its organ,
"The Irish Homestead."

Recltes I’Detry

His lectures contain many epi-
grams, anecdotes, and stories. AE re-
cites from memory long passages
from almost any poet. He is known
as ”the man who makes no enemies.”

Russell has written several books

among which are “Collected Poems,"

“Imaginations and Reveries," “Voices
of the Stones," and “The Candle of
Vision,”
