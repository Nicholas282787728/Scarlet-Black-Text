Sergei had told the group in Iowa
City about studying Dante, Shakes—
peare, Ben Johnson and Theodore
Drieser in “sredny” school (cums

And Petr was excited to learn that

Want More Variety At Saga

Results oi a recent survey conducted by Saga Food Service havejust
been released They are based on the return M415 surveys handed out
by Saga during lunch and dinner

Students were asked to rate Saga as good, acceptable, or poor, according
to various headings The lourteen categories included variety otroods,
iresbness at road, cleanliness ol tableware, quantity or lood. temperature
oi tood, ﬂavor oi lood, and attitude or employees.

Especially pleastng to the management is the tact that nine or the cater
gories were rated by at least ninety per cent as either good or acceptable.
Students appear to be most satisiied with the variety or salads, cleanlls
ness or tables, and they also thought the overall tood service was good.

lerry Ramaker, director or the lood service, was disappointed with the
low ratings received by lour categories: variety oi entrees, cleanliness
oi tableware, temperature or lood, and ﬂavor of load,

The poor opinions or the variety or entrees was unexpected it may be
necessary to place less emphasis on load tor minority groups because
none can be completely satislted, Ramaker indicated. He admitted that
the dishes and silverware may not have been as clean as they should be
because there have been some problems with the machines. However, they
have been checked by the maintenance department and are now iunctioning
properly.

Ramaker explained that the cooks have been instructed toserve the loud
completely hot, but alter it has lett the steam tables, they have no control
over it, Ramaker and crew were also surprised that the navor at the iood

at all. Now it appears that additional spices will have to be added to

MATHER '

from page one

dent members of the Remember
TEC, lelt that the committee was
uncertain whether Mr. Mather could
be seriously considered as a Candis
date when the Search procedure bee
gain. “1 had the reeling irom the very
beginning that they (the college)
wanted a black orawoman, and when
we began interviewing candidates,
we did not consider Mr. Mather
seriously because he did not tall
into either Category." She thinks
this was unfair to Mr, Mather.

Four people were interviewed tor
the position, and Mr. Mather sat in
on many or the interviewing ses-
sions “i sat in on the interviews
in the TEC, and l felt I was as com-
petent as any or the people interr
viewed.” About March be began to
push his candidacy a little, “much
mg” for the position.

Eldonna Sides and Ellen Hay, the
two student members on the TEC,
both favored his candidacy Eldonna,
who had disliked his teaching at the
very beginning, says she is con—
vinced that he is “one of the best
profs I've had at this school, He
Wanted the job and we wanted to see
him get it," Mr Mather acknow»
ledges that the decision in his case
was not an easy one torthe Commit
tee but believe that the decision had
been based only on student opinion,
he would have been i'ehii‘ed

The TEC interviewed Mr Mather
His credentials did not exactly meet
these or the job description, which
called for a ”permanent” taculty
member in the field ofeducation with
a good background in educational
psychology and some aspects oi the
philosophy or education His training
was not specifically in these areas,
but more directly in psychology. The
jot) description had been approved
sometime earlier by the TEC.

Eldonna said she was aware that
there were some discrepancies be
tween his credentials and the state

ment in the job description, She telt
that he had proved his ability to
teach well in spite or this shortage
of Credentials. “l was so in tavor
of keeping him here that i just thought
he could pull it or

in the interview, she said her posi-
tion was “shot down" because clone
or Mr Mather's statements Mather
said that he told the committee he
probably would not stay more than
two more years because he would not
have the opportunity here to teach
and do research in his specialty,
Psycho-Linguistics. Eldoiina said
that since the job description called
tor a permanent laculty member, and
since there were doubts about the
suitability of his specific credens
tials, this iatallv undermined sup
port tor the course she and Ellen
advocated

They still iavored keeping Mr
Mather, and were not convinced that
he should not be rehired, but "i
didn't know what to do," She tell
that the proceedings or the com
mittee were reasonably lair to Mr.

Mathersswlth one important excep—
tion “I thought that it was very
untair that it was not clearly estab~
lished at the beginning whether he
could be considered as a candidate,”
Eldonna would have particularly
tavored keeping Mr Mather it it had
been delinitely known at the time that
the iaculty would approve the
program in elementary education.
“Ellen and I thought that the elemen—
tary education program should have
been considered together. it a third
person was to be added to the de»
partment, we thought Mr. Mather
should stay. We had to decide the
personnel question beiore we knew
whether there would be an eleniena
She said that the student members
or the TEC tell that their opinions
were seriously considered by ‘~
TEC "We always felt an obligation
to come to meetings. and opiirimis
were always sought by o er mem-
bers of the committee' She still
wishes that Mather had been i-ehired
