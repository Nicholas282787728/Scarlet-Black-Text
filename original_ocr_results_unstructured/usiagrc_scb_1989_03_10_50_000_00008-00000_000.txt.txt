faculty respond to
Jews for Jesus

To the editor.

On Tuesday, March 7, a
representative of “Jews for Jesus”
spoke on the subject of “Christ
in Ihe Passover."

The undersigned students and
faculty wish to inform the cam.
pus community that “Jews for
Jesus" does not legitimately
respresentiewish beliefs or tradi—
Lions.

“Jews for Jesus" is an
organization whose sole purpose
is to attempt to convert Jewish
people to Christianity. “Jews for
Jesus“ demeans the uniqueness of
both Christianity and Judaism by

asserting that one can become a
Christian wiLhout giving up his
or her lewishness.

While we respect this Chris-
tian group‘s right to freedom of
speech and freedom of religion,
we want to make it clear that
they have nothing to do with any
recognized branch of Judaism or
any Jewish organization.

SCARLET AND BLACK

March 10, I989

Sacks suggests solution to
Dentel - SGA controversy

To the editor.

I am writing as a Grinnell
graduate (‘79) in response to
Brian Strausc’s letter of March 3.
Grinnell‘s entertainment program
has indeed suffered as a result of
the “ﬁring” of Georgia Dentel,
especially in the area of music.
The question we must address is
what can be done about it. I am
told that a mutual distrust has
developed between SGA and
Georgia Dentel, to the point
where both have found it difﬁcult
to collaborate this year. The re»
sult speaks for itself. I propose
two solutions: I) SGA vow that
a predetermined number of con—
certs they book next year be at
the suggestion of Georgia Dentel;
2) Ms. Dentel's budget be sub-
stantially increased. Georgia
Dentel will be retiring in a few
years. If these suggestions are
heeded, perhaps the transition can
be smooth, and Grinnell can
continue to provide the quality
entertainment for which it has
become known.

There is an attitude I sense
among some administrators that
Grinnell students no longer want
to hear progressive rock or jazz
music, and that what Mr. Strause
refers to as “antirintelleetual,

mainstream programming" is
more in line with current student
tastes. I believe this atLilude to
be false and insulting to Gn'nnell
Students. Even if it were so. the
entertainment program here
should both reflect and shape
musical tastes. I enjoyed the
Springsteen and Armatrading
concerts when I was a student
here, but what was more im-
portant to me was seeing Pat
Metheny, Brian Bowers, Charles
Mingus, Gil-Scott Heron, and
others whose music I had been

only vaguely familiar with before .

coming to Grinneil. All were
brought by Georgia Dentel in
collaboration with SGA.

I have been speaking of mu.
sic. In the area of ﬁlms. I wish
to Commend Scott Eemberg for
striking up at least a bit of a
compromise between mainstream
programming and interesting
films. Athough I had to give
Nightmare on Elm Street and
Viva La: Vegas a miss, I was
glad to have the opportunity to
see Stranger than Paradise and Dr.
Sirarigelove over the past couple
of weekends. The fact that ARH
was packed for Dr. Strangelove
refutes the contention that stu-

dents here are not ready for arty-
Lhing but mindless programming.

Rob Killion unwittingly
praised Georgia Dentei's genius
in his comments to the S and B
concerning Ms. Dentel‘s
Wednesday night film series.
Brian Strause wrote a positive
review of Mr. Bemberg’s effort,
Dr. Sirungelove. in the same is-
sue in which he blasted our mis»
treatment of Georgia Dentel.
Perhaps these ironies suggest the
possibility of something other
than an all~out war between sup-
porters of “reorganization“ and
supporters of more interesting
programming. Georgia Dentel is
a brilliant woman who has served
Grinnell College for more than
20 yws, I would like to believe
that those who malign her do so
out of ignorance of her abilities,
not malice or the thirst for
power. I hope I am not naive in
looking forward to a greater de-
gree of collaboration between
SGA and Georgia Dentel, and
more importantly, a greater de-
gree of respect for a woman who
is largely responsible for making
Grinnell a cultural oasis. Colin
Sacks, assistant professor
of psychology

Concerts Committee members
respond to Strause's criticisms

To the editor:

Surprise! 1! Another rebuttal
to an letter to the editor in the
Scarlet and Black. La5t week
Brian Strause attacked the Con-
certs and Films Committees in a
scathing letter. It should be
pointed out that Mr. Strause
never communicated his concerns
with the concert program to any-
one on or related to the commita
tee. The Concens Committee is
willing to admit there have been
some problems with booking
this year. but it is the ﬁrst year
of the new structure which we
believe will be more representa-
tive of student interests titan the
old structure given a little more
time. The Concerts Committee
as well as other SGA committees
not only welcome suggestions or
questions, but encourage them.
We have explanations and guide
lines which have directed us this
year including a campus survey
indicating the musical interests of
the student body. We have used
this survey as an aid in booking
concerts. This information is
readily available ttpon request.
There are other outlets to express
your opinions or concerns other
than a public whipping in the s
and E. The power of the press is
dangerous. People will believe
anything that is written down,
because “no one would take the
time to write it down unless it
was true.”

Apparently, Brian, you do not
understand fully the situalion
upon which you cditorialized.
Georgia Dentel is still in charge
of Public Events and has brought
us such great acts as the Chinese
Peking Acrobats. Further, as
most pcoplc are aware. Georgia

does not leave her house, which
makes interaction with the cor“—
mittee very difﬁcult. By having
her own budget Georgia is able 1 .
work out of her home, which is
necessitated by her condition.
You mention that Georgia
brought in more acts in the past
than this year's Concerts Come
mittec. However. she also had a
subsoantially larger budget than
our current $25,000 per semester.
By the way, the committee put
on ten shows last semester, not
the eight you claim, and is more
than Georgia's nine in the Fall of
1987. Please be aware that our
budget money not only covers
the cost of the band, but also
covers the costs of hospitality,
student labor, and sound compa»
nies. A band which costs $2000
for the performance may entail
additional expenses amounting to
as much as $1000. .We have tried
to utilize the budget available to
us to the fullest extent.

In addition, we on the Com-
mittee have striven to bring a
large number of acts to campus.
We have also attempted to offer a
variety of acts to appeal to a wide
range of musical tastes. The
campus community has been able
to enjoy _ jazz, blues, country,
rock, reggae, Christian rock, RB,
and ”dance". Whilc official
records are not kept, it appears
that concert attendance is up sig
nificantly this year and atLrition
at concerts down. How many
shows have you been to this year
Mr. Suausc? You clearly did not
attend the concert which was
”scheduled merely for the purpose
of Parents’ Weekend.” Randy Szlv
bien is a highly respected jazz

musician, and the concert was
well attended, including students
without their parents. Further,
the audience showed its appreciate
tion for the show by purchasing
numerous albums and tapes from
Mr. Sabicn. In addition, many of
the acts which we have booked
this year are relatively well—
known. Perhaps your musical
taste has restricted your exposure
to some of the bands we have
brought to campus, but Emo,
Timbuk3, Chick Corea, Book of
Love, Honor Among Thieves,
Kinsey Report, and Lonnie
Brooks all represent well-known
or quality acts in their respective
genres with at least one album
each in print. The big acts which
you referred to in your attack
were, for the most part, not big
names when they appeared here.
How do you know that Honor
Among Theives or The Indigos
will not become superstars? In
addition, since when does a big
name guarantee quality? Tiffany
is a big name, but even if the
committee had the $040,000
which she gets per show, we
wouldn't waste our or the cam»
pus‘ time with such trash. We
are not booking bands for Public
Relations to put in our admission
packet.

In short Mr. Strauss you are
clearly upset by the fact that you
were not appointed to the chair of
the Committee this year and are
waxing your political wings for a
run at the position for next year.
We wish you luck. We are not
accusing you of lying; you are
just uninformed. Booking bands
is not like ordering from the
Sears Catalog. Charles A.
Rita, Blair H. Kolb
