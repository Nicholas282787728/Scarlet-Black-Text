How to cut
the cost
of driving.

If you drive with
more consideration
for bicyclists, more
people will bike
instead of drive.
When they do, the
cost of cars, car
parts and repairs,
gas, parking, and
insurance will go
down because
there will be less
demand for them.
Traffic congestion,
driving time, and
noise will go down,
too. And air quality
will go up. And all
because you drive
with more consider-
ation for bicyclists.

Thank you.
