sibly a combination of viruses
and immune reactions. There is
no labomtory test available yet to
definitely Confirm or rule out
posSIble MS. More extensive
and expensive procedures are
needed to make confirmations oi
the disease. An additional prob:
lem is that other diseases of the
central nervous system can have
similar symptoms.

The strange thing about
MS is that some people who are
diagnosed as having it can be af-
fected slightly, While others can
suffer drastic symptoms. Initial

symptoms may include any of
the following: speech problems.
shaking in the hands, numbness
or pricking feelings, unusual
tiredness, dragging of the feet.
loss of balance, or any form of
paralysis.

Several of the students in
SAMS have a parent with MS,
including myself and cchhaIt'per-
son Elana Behar. Our personal
experiences are what made us feel
the need for a student group like
SAMS. Most of the people in
the group had never known any-
one else who grew up in a family

ings with people who have "been
there." Not everyone in the group
has a family member with MS.
One student was diagnosed as
having MS last year. Some of
her friends became a part of
SAMS in order to better under-
stand what she is dealing with,
and to also give some of their
time to help fight a disease that
we feet can be beaten

What can college students
do to ﬁght MS? SAMS feels
that awareness on campus is is
critical. Grinnell is famous for
being aware, so this should be
easy, Just learning the facts
about Ms and sharing them with
others is a great help in this
fight. The group is going to or
ganize an awareness program next
semester. If you would like to
