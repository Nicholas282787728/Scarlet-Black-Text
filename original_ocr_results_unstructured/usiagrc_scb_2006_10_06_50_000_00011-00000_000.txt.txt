Get Real
itttﬁ

Earnest tale of coming
of age and coming out

Ger Rm] follows teenager Steven
Carter (Ben Silverstonc) in his efforts
to both come of age and come out of
the closet, Steven lives in Basingstoke,
a bland suburb in England where rhe
space for sclfrdcfinition is ﬁlled with
cigarettes, heterosexual romance and
sports.

Unfortunately, Steven isn't inter-
esred in any or rhesc, although he does
watch Sportsﬂr more accurately,
watch his school's athletes through the
lens ofa cameia.

However, Steven soon ﬁnds some-
one staring back at him, In the park
bathroom, Steven speaks with some
guy in the neighboring stall, and they
agree to meet by the bench outside As
Steven waits for the stranger troni the
stall to emerge, none other than John
Dixon (Brad Gorton)7an ubetrnthlete
whom token tatrgirl Linda describes as
“sex on legs"—wallts timidly out of the
seedy bathroom They talk awkwardly
almost part ways, go over to Stevens
place, talk a little less awkwardly, r -
most get it on and partways, well, awk»
\vai'dly.

Get Rm! presents the classic theme
of forbidden romance tales: the tug-o-
war between personal needs and soci-
etal expectations. However, the film
avoids triteness by painting the struggle
between love and conformity in shades
ofgrey.

Director srmon Shores develop-
ment of Steven and John's rclalim‘r
ship draws our attention to the futility
of cultivating love in piivate. Steven
responds to John's declararion or love
with, Howcanlktlowthal?“ 13y brings
ing to light rhe impossibility offceling
secure in a relationship that one of the
partners refuses to acknowledge in
public, Shore discourages us from igs
norantly celebrating the young men's
secretive interactions as a complete
victory of love over a tragically narrow—
minded culture.

However, Shore also takes seriously
the challenge of integrating one's ptr
vare life into rhe public sphere. John's

fear of people discovering his illicit
romance does not come across as cow-
ardice; rather, Brad Goiton's laudable
performance conveys the colossal difti»
culty of choosing berween sclfrexprcsr
sion and social acceptance.

Gar Km], for the most part, lives
up to its name. Although many of the
film’s elements are typical ora teen ﬂick
(a bumbling best friend, interrclique
romance and parenrrchild alienation,
to name just a few), it more than makes
up for ‘it with real actors, a real script
and a real message. And in .ny opinion,
it’s real good.

Imagine Me & You

ittﬁﬁ

Love story is more
mainstream than queer

Imagine Me is? Yﬂll isn't good, but it
isn't bad eithei. The movie puts a twist
on mainstream romanric comedies by
challenging rhe idea rhar a happy endr
ing means the boy gets the girl. Instead,
it uses felinulaic Hollywood conven-
tions to bring two women together,

The aim begins with rhe wedding
of Rachcl (Piper Petabo) and [mi dots
ing fiance, Heck (Matthew Goodc).
As she ivalks down the aisle, the ﬂorist
for the wedding, Luce (Lena Hcadcy),
catches the bride’s eye and the audience
knows it is love ar first sight, cven irrhc
characters won't acknowledge ir for an-
other hour.

All is clearly not well with the new
lyivcds as Heck notes that Rachel's re
lationship with hrrn begins ro change,
although the audience would be hard-
prcssed to make the same observation
since Pcrabo's character never seems to
develop past the pouty, confused biitle
she poitiavs at the movies stait.

T he Fundamental problem With the
movie is that as Rachel distances her
self from Heck, the audience wondeis
why we should care about Rachel at all
Heck is so much more developed of
a character than the leading lady that
viewers transfer all their sympathy to
him.

We want to see Heck get ahead at
the end orthe movie, and alrhough the
direcror 0] Parker attempts to wrap up
his part ofthe stoiy, the attempt is weak

Miyazaki is one of the most m,

for good reason. The artistic srylings

be as polished or sophisticated as many
American animated feittiiies, it by far
surpasses mostJapanese animation and
is thl’slllled to the telling of the sweet
and simple story.

The lilm is about Mai and Satsuki,
two young sisters who burn with the
cuteness of a thousand tiny kittens.
They and their dad have inst moved
into a new home while their mother
recuperates from an unspeciﬁed ill-
ness in the hospital, The girls proceed
to laugh aiid yell and run around a lot,
havmg various adventures, many of
which revolve around a supernatural
cnriry called Tororo, who is sort ofa big
panda/chipmunk thing,

Do not go to see this movie if you
aie in the mood to be easily annoyed,
or rryour rolerance ror thi ltiud orcnr
tcttainincnt is low. This is 86 minutes
ofa pair ofcute little giils being a pair
ot‘curc little girlsThcre's sorr ora plor
in rhcre somewhere especially towards
the end, but it isnt vctv important.

Mostly, this movie is about how
many times Miyaznki can make you go
“Awwl” in the course of an hour and a
half. The answer is: many rirncs.This is
a really sweet movie with not an ounce
of malice in it, and it has no other ino-
tive than to make you smile a lot.
