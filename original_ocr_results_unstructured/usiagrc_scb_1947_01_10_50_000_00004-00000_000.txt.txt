the elimination iound of the
tournament when Coe squeezed
out a 58—56 victory after a five
minute overtime period. Behind
33-22 at the half, the Pioneer
ﬁve returned to the floor with
new life. and the fourth period
ended with the score knotted at
45 all. Then Peisner and Carlson
dropped in two fast buckets, but

ing a 28-13 lead. Cornell sped
through the Second half to make
a Sizzling contest of it before
they dropped the game. calla

attack, while high-paint honors
for Cornell went to Horsfali, whc
also had 18.

consolation game and took third
place in the tournament by easily
shading Central 64-49. The brand
