Pioneers Face
Hard Contest
at Marquette

(Conlinued from Page 1).

fourth meeting of the Hilltoppers
with the Pioneers. Crinnell opened
the rivalry on their home lot in 1526
with a victory but lost at Milwaukee
in 19'27. Last year, swinging into
the fourth quarter trailing 20 to 13,
Grinnell scored three touchdowns to
win, 20 to 13. Opening up one ‘of the
greatest passing attacks ever seen
here. the Pioneers swept the length
of the field twice and finally scored
th winning touchdown whn Bradley
blocked a punt and Fail pounced on it
over the goal line.

Although the sensational half,
swede Cebert, is not back with the
Blue and Cold this year. several of
the veterans are on hand and their
power is indicated by the '40 to o
victory over Lawrence last week.

Corbett. who did the passing for
Marquette in 1928, and who directs
frim his quarterback position, is car
captain with Radick, tackle, this
year. other men who performed in
a sensational fashion here .in‘ 1923
and who are back with the eleven
this season are Klaus at left half and
Eugge at end. - .

Coach Watt has not yet indicated
what his starting lineup will be but
it will probably find Mantire, Ruff.
Liedtke and Rose in the backfield.
Liedtke has been showing up well on
the receiving end of passes and may
start for Douglass. Bennw 'played a
great de‘fensive game in the Tuesday
scrimmage, however, which may re-
deem hlm in the eyes of the mentor.

Marquette is Strong,

Reports Show.

Milwaukee. Wis., Oct. 3 — Ovei
the top in their first game which
they trounced Lawrence college, 40 to
o, Marquette university gridders now
have turned their attention o next
Saturday’s battle here with Grinnell
.coliege, Grinnell. In. . . .

In defeating the vikings last Sat-
:urdny, Marquette showed : great
=st1'zngth but displayed a laclc‘pt pol.

 

that Clyde Grant’s Iowans,

ish in many departments. Coaches
Frank J. Murray and John L, (Tar-
zan) Taylor lost no time Monday in
starting to remedy the deficiencies,
and an even stronger team is looked
for next Saturday. Exclusive of
touchdown plays, the Avalanche
made eight first downs against
Lawrence.

The Marquette backfield, flashy as
it was. did not gather all the glory in
the opener. Tarznn's Taylor's line
was just about all that was expected
from the Ohio State all-western
both offensively and defensively.
They charged savagely and
broke through to spill the opposition
for losses. as well as opening holes
and furnishing neat interference fur
their own hacks.
