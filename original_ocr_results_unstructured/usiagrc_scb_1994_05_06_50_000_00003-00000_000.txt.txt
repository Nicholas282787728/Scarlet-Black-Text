Recently,GladeSowards,mnnager
of Bob’s Underground was approached
byAmyGemonaboutplanninganevcnt
on Thursday, Atril 28 to kick-off the
GrinneilReiays Sowards and assistant
manager Roy Rich brainstormed for a
while. They knew that they wantw to

of theRelays.

The two decided on creating a
coffee drink-off. Students would
sign-up for the competition. Be-
tween 9:30 pm. and midnight, conr
testants would drink all the coffee
they could possibly consume. The
three competitors who drank the most
coffee would win gift cenificates to

about all the diseases that they
die from."

Eugenia Baskakova, the final
speakerfortheopposilion,supported
Zamouline’s argument by claiming
thatthe useof animals as food is part
of the natural orderr “Let’s talk
about what is natural," she said “I
think it is natural for humans to eat
meat. Humans are actually omnivor
rous.”

However, Aaron Gross took
the debate from the natural realm
to the world of morality. “What
happens to us as human beings
when, knowing that animals suf-
fer, we continue to let that sufr
fering go on?“ Gross asked. “The
answer, I believe, is the death of
what is most beautiful in us,
When we willingly suspend our
morality, we denigrate our-
selves."

and after the coffee had wen sitting
around fora while, it had become stale.
Despite itsorry state, the coffee was still
potable. This coffee was used for the
competition.

Approximately 60 suldenls signed-
up for Bob's Coffee Showdown, and
about 30 participated. Most people had
one or two cups of coffee. Sowards
estimated the average at about three or
four cups. Some students drank a lot
more than that

By the end of the evening, Fla-in

declared that the budget for the pro-
gram for the year 1994-1995 would
be $10,000 - the same as this year,
with no budget cuts. According to
the administration, the Noun
program’s budget would remain the
same because it is a supplementary
program and not a true academic
curriculum program. and they feel it
is more important to focus on fund-
ing the academics.

gender boundaries. This, he said,
makes it appropriate for men to
