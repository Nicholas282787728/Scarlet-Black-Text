program coordinators, Jodi Hester and.

Chrystelle Mason, intend to actively ime
prove student relations as well as ade
ministrative relations. Both women
believe that some nonrblacks do not
understand the need {or a black cultural
center, Chrystelle believes that “some
students still view the existence oi the
center as a separatist action.” According

to Chrystelle and Jodi, it is necessary ior .

blacks to discuss their feelings about being
on a predominantly white campus. The
center provides an environment where
black students can socialize or study. They
believe that this cultural interaction
prevents a loss oi identity Even though
most people who come to Grinnell lose a
part of themselves, Chrystelle holds the
oplnlon that it is more dangerous for
minority students because their per-
sonalities and liiestyles are based on
cultural interaction. ln response to the opi—
nion that black students don't mingle
enough with noneblack students at meals,
movies, and other campus activities, Jodi
points out that non»black students do the
same thing Rae Whatley, last year’s pro-
gram coordinator, agrees, saying, “inter-
national students socialize with each
other, but black students stand out more ”

Although the black cultural center is us-
ed primarily by black students, activities
are planned ior the whole campus. Unfore
tunately, most people don't realize this.

For example, last year the cultural center'

hosted an all-campus reception ior die
Airican dance troupe; only three non-
black students attended. In addition,
Fireside Lectures taking place at the
center are not solely designed ior black
students even though the audiences are
usually all black. chrystelle and Jodi feel
that the lack oi participation by noneblack
students is due to two factors: a general
hesitance to visit the center ii a person
does not have any black friends, and an
unawareness ol the center’s location or ex-
istence. Until last spring, the cultural
center wasn't even on the campus tours.
Chrystelle points out that “tour guides
didn't bring perspectives to the center, but
they took them through every corner oi
Burling’s Basement."

Besides awakening the noneblack com-
munity to the presence of the center, Jodi
and chrystelle have begun creating a
friendlier atmosphere within the black
community itseli. chrystelle mentioned
that when she was a freshman, she didn’t
know where the center was. A feeling oi
isolation from the other black students
contributed to insecurities about her
“place” on campus. Because she didn't
realize Others were in the same situation,
she almost didn’t return to Grinnell. The
Peer Assistance Program, which was in-
itiated last spring for all students, has
eliminated a certain amount of hesitance
on the part of new students to VlSit the

center. According to Chrystelle and Jodi, a
more closely knit community has already
resulted,

Further activities have been planned for
this semester. On September 9. Vice»
President Waldo Walker and Dean
Catherine Frazer will open the Fireside
Lecture series, During black awareness
week, the convocation speaker will be Dr.
Jacqueline Fleming, who will lecture on
what it is like to be black on a
predominantly white campus. ln addition,
on October 4, the Albert Macneil singers
will perform for black awarenas week.

Crady, Associate Dean oi student Aiiairs,
and Marilyn Kurtz, Director of Career
Development, increased her desire to
work at Grinnell. The clincher ior Beth
was a visit to Grinnell. She liked the town
as well as the campus, Both Beth and her
husband, Philip de Ricco, were ready to
leave the metropolitan area oi New
Jersey, and Grinnell seemed to be the
oeriect opportunity to do so.

Beth has no tangible goals ior her new
job, but she wants to see people take
responsiblity ior their actions and
liiestyles. She ieels that the seli-
governance oi the students helps. she add-
ed that at most other universities, the
Resident Advisor acts more as a
disciplinarian than a peer counselor. Beth
hopes that her staii realizes the profes-
sional nature oi their jobs as S.A.’s and
R.H.A.‘s,

0n the tar northern end or campus,
Dwayne Olivers lives. He is the Resident
Advisor ior Norris and Cowles. Although
he is originally irom Kansas City,
Missouri, Dwayne graduated irom the
Uniersity oi Northern Inwa with a degree
in history, In 1983, he received his MA in
Airo-American Studies irom um. and
presently will pursue a doctorate in higher
education.

Dwayne has held various jobs in com-
munity centers ior adult recreation and
has also worked in administration. He
views his job at the Career Development
Office as preparation ior iurther ad~
ministrative work. Dwayne emphasizes
the Career Development Office as a
valuable resource ior students, Because
the campus is a small community, he reels
more individual attention can be given to
students.

New R.A,’s go through the same transi»
tion from old to new friends that new
students go experience All four R.A.‘s
agree that they rely upon the stail for peer
socializing. Although Phame admits that it
is not the same as getting together with
other 25-year-olds, he wouldn't be here ii
he didn’t want to be. As Beth remarked.
“We [the R.A.lsl are proiessionals who
have chosen to spend our lives in higher
education with a commmitment to growth

consciences about nuclear disarmament,
Ms. Connelly noted that “this is not a vigil
as Greenham has become. It’s an attempt
to develop an increasing outreach and to
encourage Americans all along the route
and beyond to be more active in opposing
nuclear arms," Grinnell supporters col-
lected approximately onethousand dollars
to buy blue ribbons bearing the signatures
of Grinnell townspeople for the marchers

A suggestion has been made [or an
eastward march originating in Grinnell.
Although a destination is undecided, the
walk will most probably take place in
November. Ms. Connelly remarked that
”sitting at Greenham and walking from
LA. to Washington, D.C. doesn’t dismane
tle weapons. Weallknnwlhat But itwarns
our governments that we are not compla-
cent."

that they are too topicspeciiic and do not
deal enough in basic concepts of general
education,

He also feels senior level course could
better take advantage of their ”knowledge
and sophistication to deal with general
education issues.”

“That’s one of the first things on the
agenda,” he said of the curriculum
broadening.

Meanwhile, Frazer plans to return to her
home in Cape Cod once the school year is
over and “work on several kinds oi pro
jects — save the coastline projects and the
Cape Cod Natural History Museum” 7 as
well as visit with her children and grand
children.

However, she has not yet ruled out
several visiting professorships, ‘

send the $100 million over to me contras to
overthrow the government,” he said.

One of the first members of Congress to
go to Nicaragua to assess the situation,
Bedell feels U.S. policy is not working to
erode support for the current Nicaraguan
government, which he labeled ”incompe
tent" and engaged in “oppression oi the
people" as well as overly iriendly to camp
munist countries.

“We’re helping them [the Sandinistasl
win the support or their people,” said
Bedell, adding that he knew of no better
way to strengthen the support of the people
by making them feel “threatened by an in
vasion from outsiders.”

Bedell said his greatest concern was a
statement made by the President that “We
HAVE to see ‘ that government
overthrown.”

“I know there's no one in the Congress
who thinks that $100 million will enable the
contras to overthrow the government," he
said. ,

“When l was there, there was little or no
support {or those contra forces because. ,.
the contras were raiding the countrySide
and indiscriminately kidnapping and
murdering the common people.”

As to solutions to the numerous pm,
blems addressed, Bedell mentioned “iive
major votes" in the House that called [or a
nuclear test ban, continuation to abide by
Salt II, a limit on the President's expene
ditures on Star Wars, a limit on anti-
satellite weapon testing, and a prohibition
on nerve gas production. However, he feels
the chances oi these amendments passing
in the Senate are sllm.

As for Nicaragua, he expressed beliei in
the effectiveness oi the Contadora Group
negotiations and feels the U.S. must
negotiate with the Nicaraguan govern-
ment.

Bedell’s lecture was sponsored by Grin-
nell College's Prngrgm in practical
Political Education and is part of Bedell’s
Stop the Arms Race Political Action Com-
mittee speaking tour.
