Sprung Spring Day

For once Spling Day was Spiung Those \lith tlle‘ ills”

Day “as a houling success

If we‘ awarded coconuts to Gadabouts for “Then Was

Committee for the best Spring Day ill our Grinnell memory
book.

Not only twice the surprise of "Surprise Day,” it was
fun from its beginning under the cloudless blue morning
sky till its end under the stars. And getting the whole-
hearted cooperation of the weatherman or whatever pow,
ers that he certainly didn’t detract from the excitement.

What Price Sleep?

What’s a night’s sleep worth at Grinnell college?

It’s worth, in varying places and circumstances, $1.50,
$1.00 or 60c to a guest. It may involve sleeping on a holly-
wood bed in a Quadrangle guest room, occupying an absent
student‘s bed, or lying on a metal cot. That is, if everything
is within housekeeping rules

We wonder what’s what.
take note:

Investigating Commission,

double, clean

Quadrangle guest room, single or
towels, clean sheets: $1.50 a night.

Metal cot, moved into student’s room, Quadrangle,
clean towels, clean sheets: $1.50 a night.

Some service, men’s dormitories: $1.00 a night.

Absent student's bed, clean towels, clean sheets:
60c if maid is notified in the day time, 75c at night.

Here follows a true story—no embellishments:

Yesterday a Loose hall junior spoke with her house-
mothel- about accommodations for her mother for this
weekend. She simply wanted towels and bed linens to put
on a cot she herself could provide. (1) She talked to her
housemother who (2) sent her to the Quadrangles head
housekeeper who thought it would be necessary to charge
the same fee as that for a guest room. (3) Our victim con-
sulted the rule book and deciding the principle of the mat-
ter was wrong (4) called housekeeping and explained her
problem to someone (5) who in turn put Mrs. Ferguson on
the "phone. Repeating her sad tale she was answered with
the suggestion that (6) she ask Miss Gardner—who wasn‘t
in. She (7) told her story to Miss Leinmons who said (8)
she would relay the message to Miss Gardner if (9) our
friend would be able to See Miss Gardner in the morning
for an answer.

Impossible? We only wish it were. Will someone please
take it upon themselves to unscramble the red tape?

Student Council Reviews Conference Participation

At a meeting yesterday afte’l
noon, the Grimell Student Coun-
cil heard reports about various
conferences.

Future conferences — National
Student Association in Minnea-
polis and a conference at Cor-
nell on “drinking rules" —— as
Well as past conferencesi'NSA
in Iowa City and Midwest Cone
fetence at Monmouth—were up
for discussion.

The Council decided to Send a
representative to the NSA cone
ference this summer, but will
wait until a later meeting to
decide upon a representative for
the Cornell Conference. Due to
a shortage of time, represents
lives to the NSA conference at
Monmouth were asked to report
at next week’s meeting.

within the conference, an 21117
school calendar, the power a

nation problem) and women's
hours and punishment. Margaret
commenced at the end of the re.
port that “Grinnell is by far bet-
ter off on the major issues, but
there are little things we can
improve."

Because Grinncll seems to be
giving more than it is getting
from the conferences attended,
the question came up as to
whether the school should re-

Coci Displays Extreme Sensitivii‘y
To Appreciaiive Grinneil Audience

By Elbert Smith
Outstanding among the music-
31 events at Grinnell were the
two concerts 1n Herrick Chapel
on muddy, May 4, by Claire Coci,
internationally famous concert
organist

In an exacting and difficult
program, Miss Cocl displayed
such dazzling technique and ex1
ti'eme sensitivity, together with
a beauty of interpretation and
flair fur tone color, that her 115.
teners felt she was at all times
1n complete mastery- of the in-
strument before her, and, as one
critic has said. “she and the on
gan'were one.”

Perhaps the most unusual and
thoroughly impressive composi-
uon on her program was the
monumental Fantasy and Fugue
on the Chorale “Ad Nos, ad Sale
utarem undcm" by Liszt. con-
sldered by Saint Seen: “the most
extraordinary place ever con-
cc1vcd for organ,” and one selr
dom performed 1n its entirety.
Other numbers included major
works by Bach, Brahms; Haydn,
Wider, Honegger, and
Sowccby.

During :he evening concert,
Miss Ccci graciously invited the
organ students to sit near the
console This unusual opportuni—
fo1~ close observation of the
efficiency and ease whh which
she handled the large lnsuu
ment heightened the inspiration
wh1ch her performance had al-
ready produced.

Miss Coci's charming manner
111 mspondlng untlrlngly to lhc
enthusiastic applause with sev-
eral cncorcs, including the app
peuling “Le Coucou by d’Aquln,
the oft requested “Toccata in
r" by Widor, and the deeply
emotional "Come, Saviour of the
Gentiles” by Bach, increased still
Iurtller the enjoyment of a de-
llglltful musical occasion

felt the membership should be
continued. The final decision of
the council will not be made
until next fall.

Antonia Garst, James fresh.
man, reported that she had seen
Dean Evelyn Gardner about the
possibility of a Negro exchange
professor. Her report was favor
able, but Dr. Samuel Stevens
will have to be consulted before
action can be taken.
