sized team, usi g a Minnesota
type offense similar to that em-
ployed by Lawrence and have
beaten DePauw and Gate by big
scores. (Carleton-Cue, 35-0).

The Carls boast a well organ-
ized backfield, sparked by the
right-hand passing of Curt Rott-
ke, LH, 175-pound senior who
starred against iCee and DePauw.
At right half, Wright does the
chores, passing leftehanded. Rack-
ow, at tullback, and Winterble,
at quarterback, complete the com-
bination, witb.Wintei-bie working
as blocking back.

Should Beloit dump Lawrence
Saturday, Cornell trounce Mane
mouth, and Grinnell romp over
the Caris, the conference will
have Lawrence, Grinnell, Cornell,
and Beioit in a four-way tie for
firsteplace honors, On a percent-
age basis, Cornell’s seven-game
schedule gives them a better
than average chance, while Mons
mouth has only five contercnce
games on which to make a stand.

Again the Pioneers will be caul
tious and ready, but they now
have the incentive ot placing high
in the conference race.

Engraved as indelibly in the
legends of the South as hominy

the offspring of Basin and Beale

Linclee,stuff, that. Pushed Via
New Orleans, Chicago, and New
York by greats like Eddie Con-
don, Bix Beiderbecke, Pee Wee
Russell, and Muggsy Spanier,
dixieland wormed its way to the
top,

By making every man a soloist.
it produced such hits as “Panar
ma", “That’s A Plenty”, and
“Jazz Me Blues!" Waxed mainly
by Commodore and a little by
Viol-01‘. dixleland bounced from

Not all dixieland is frenetic.

Miller. heading 3 combo from
Cedar Rapids. Many campus
wheels will remember his elegant
dance music, interspersed with
jazz ala dixie, such as ”Doodle—
De»Doo” and ViC'S arrangement
of “Tiger Rag."

For those really interested in
fine jazz, and dixieland in par-
ticular, chils Dave Garroway ot‘
the "11:60 club” edited a jazz
catalog of real jazz classics.

Those who are not hidebound by

old baby . . . dixieland jazz.
