While Grinnell wins its share of confer
ence titles, to characterize it as an athletic
powerhouse would be, to put it nicely, absurd.
Administrators promote "no limits,” but the
brainy admission standards and lack ofathletic
scholarships often show char athletic prowess
is, in ﬁrct, limited for a number ofsports. But
if you compare Grinnell to its conference fees
in a certain group of sports, Grinnell almost
always comes out on rep of the liberalearrs
athletic heap.

Grinnell’s legacy otlate has been streaks.
Both tennis teams and the womcn’s cross
country team have Won four years in a row.
Men’s swimming has rvon six in n row. Worn-
en's swimming has won nine straight titles.
And leading the way is the men’s cross country
team, with 11 straight MWC titles. These all
show that Grinnell's dominance deﬁes the ef—
fects of graduation and
prove that Grinnell can
consistently reload.

The problem,
though, is that Grin-
nell's conference titles
come in a weak con-
ference, making these
conference titles incan-
ingless when Grinnell
faces nonrconfcrence opponents. Every corr—
ference champion has this problem, regardless
of sport. Carroll's basketball ream made it to
the round of 16 in last year's NCAA men’s bas-
ketball tournament, as did Lawrence’s the year
before, but teams rarely make it farther than
that. In addition, the MWC rarely qualiﬁes an
at-large team for NCAA tournaments, a sign
that the NCAA has deemed the conference
too weak to admit two teams.

This disparity between conferences is evir
dent when you compare conference records
to nonrconference records. Consider the
women's soccer season. During their nonrconr
ference schedule, the team only went 475. In
their MWC schedule, however, they went (r4,
including victories of 1270 and 970. A similar

story has played out for the men’s team. They
went 27571 in nonrconference games, but want
773 in their conference schedule.

Tennis provides another example. The
team plowed its way through MWC competir
rion, never losing more than rhree matches (of
nine) against a conference opponent on their
way to another title. Four players won singles
titles, and Grinnell’s team point total was well
ahead of the next competitor. But outside of
the conference, the room learned it was only
the third best Division III team in the state,
dropping non»confcrcncc matches to both
central college and Loras.

Looking at the conference as a whole, a sta-
tistical website,www.masseyratingscom,ranks
conferences using a formula based on wins and
losses, game margins, strength of schedule and
opponents’ performance. According to their
computerized ratings, the MWC for women's
soccer ranked 33rd
out of 45 NCAA
Division III confer-
ences, weak in com—
parison to other area
conferences, such as
the seventh iailkcd
MIAC or 12th»
tanked IIAC. Men’s
soccer tells a similar
tale, as does football (comparisons for other
spor ts were not available).

Naturally, judging the overall strength of
a conference is difficult. Schools and athletic
programs change from year to year due to
graduation, coaching changes and other mn’
dom factors.

But the streaks ofour best teams have pl'OV’
en that we still have consisterttly good teams.
But this still hasn't gotten Grinnell anywhere
on the national scale.

While statistics can and often do lie, in
many sports, Grinnell far outstrips its com,
petitors in the MWC, leading one to ask ifthe
conference provides reasonable competition.
Last year, Grinnell had the highest number of
women’s sports that were conference champir
ons (swrmming, cross country, soccer and tens
ms) and tied for the highest in men's sports
(cross country, basketball, swimming and ten
nis).

Granted, there are notable differences from
sport to sport, For every Grinnell powerhouse,
there’s a team like football, volleyball or womr
en’s basketball that has perennially struggled.
In fact, Grinnell has relatively few middle of
the pack teams.

For the women's cross country team, qualir
fying for nationals has been a mosrly elusive
goal, despite the team’s four consecutive can,
fercnce championships.

“We've had individuals [qualify] before,
bur last year was the first time the women's
team qualiﬁed as a team," said Evelyn Freer
man. women’s cross country head coach. She
also mentioned that Grinnell sustains its ath-
letic programs well despite a smaller pool of
athletes due to the higher academic standards.

Paul Gagne '10, a swimmer, agreed. “There
are schools in the conference that have the best
‘bcst swimmers' as us,” he said, "but nobody has
even close to the depth."

Jill Akimaya '10, however, does not find
much difference playing tennis in and out of
conference. “There are good teams: St. Not—
hert, Beloit,” she said, although she mentioned
Luther and Gustavus Adolphus as difficult
matches out-of—conference.

some Grinnell teams have essentially “ac
cepted their fate” by placing little emphasis on
conference play. “We don't have to have coma
petition with any of the conference schools unr
til the conference meet," Freeman said. ““We
tend not to see too many ofthe teams through

the regular season, apart from Monmouth and
Knox."And they don't. Neither cross country
team, pro-conference, participated in a meet
involving more than two MWC teams.

Liz Carrier ’07, assistant women’s soc—
ccr coach, added rhat Grinnell intentionally
schedules difficult non-conference matches.
“They are games that are designed to chal—
lenge our team."Carrier said.

Gagne also stressed the importance of srrch
“reality check” matches in improving team
performance. “The University of Chicago is
alvmys a humility check at the beginning of
the year. They always kill us", he said, adds
ing that it was a reminder of competition since
Grinnell has won conference so often.

Gagne also noted the dominance of his
sport, men’s swimming, by a few teams nations
ally. A few conferences dominate nationals,and
Kenyon has won both the men’s and women's
titles practically every year since 1984.

“There's a group ofschools, about four-to-
five who compete at the top level. there’s a cou-
ple that are middlerofrrlre pack, and a couple

that traditionally are lower-tier,” Carrier said,
noting that no team has changed groups in the
five years she has been involved in soccer.

These sentiments help to cement Grins
ncll's status as an anomaly in the Midwest
Conference. Being located on the western
fringe ofthe conference, teams get to see nonr
conference opponents from the Iowa Intercolr
legiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) and the
Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Confer
ence (MIAC). Sharing opponents with orher
MWC teams rarely happens.

So while the MWC may not be balanced
and challenging in some sports, conference
play is but a small part of the athletic program
for Grinnell’s teams. Considering the alterna-
tivesﬂcademic standards in the IIAC tend to
be lower, and travel times would nor improve
in the MIAcithere is little choice but for
Grinnell to remain in the MWC. So get ready
for more “[insert Grinnell power] wins confer-
ence title" headlines. They wont be stopping
anytime soon.
