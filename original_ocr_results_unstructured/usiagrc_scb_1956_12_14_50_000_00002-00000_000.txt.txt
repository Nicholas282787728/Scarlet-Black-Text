Sackcloth And Ashes

By Gene Thompson

1 know it's hard to do, what
with all this Yule Log and
Boar's iioad spirit and all, but
let's pretend that we‘ve taken
the “average Grinnell girl” out
of the Quadrangle and set her
down somewhere in the middle
of everythingilet's say in the
middle of ARH auditorium, all
alone.

Now let‘s give her a name—
iust so we can refer to her with.
out having to say “average
Grinnell girl" every time. Let's
call her Georgia Glotz, She'd
like to be called Tess Trueheart
or Virginia Crane or maybe Mar.
garet O‘Brien, but I think
Georgia Glotz will do as well—
and anyway, i don’t feel like
being too nice to her.

There she sits, dressed in
her tweed skirt, her cashmere
sweater, and her saddle shoes.
She looks very nice, really—
elean. well—mannered, and
neat. Above all, she is right
in style. And she’s probably a
pretty good student. She learns
right from the hook and right
from the professor. and that’s

' why she passes all her exams.

l
i
t

Georgia doesn't get much of a
mark tor class participation,
and when she does participate,
her ideas are right from the
book and right from the pro.
fessor. But she‘s a good stu—
dent. And she’s right in style.

She’s probably not an English
major. She probably went to the
Gates lectures but didn't really
understand it all. And she.prob-
ably didn’t ask questions of any~
body, although any professor
would have been quite willing
to discuss Mr. Greene’s ideas.
She probably thinks that such
things as segregation are wrong,
but she has no idea of why such
things happcn. She has probably
heard about Hungary, but she
probably doesn't have any opin-
ion on what the U. s. and the
u. N. are doing.

I’m saying ”probably" to all
these things because not every.
one fits in Georgia’s precise
category. But a surprisingly

large number do.

You see, Georgia is one of
the girls that went to the
houscmecting a week ago last
Monday night and heard the
proposal for an 5&3 reporter
in closed meetings of the Lea-
gue hoard. At the same time
she heard, either from a LB
member or the 5&3, the “per-
sonalities” argument — that
there was a danger of the re-
porter gossiping about the LB‘s
discussion of problems involv-
ing specilic persons.

And Georgia voted “no" with

no questions asked.

What‘s Georgia doing now, by
the way? why. she's knitting—
knitting a pair of socks' Just
relax, Georgiaaknit your head
off—we'll be back to you in a
minute.

But Georgia didn’t ask any
questions in that housemeetr
ing. If she had, she would have
found out the following things:

1, That there is positively no
danger of any "personality"
information being revealed by
the reporter. In the first place,
The 5&3 has no desire for
the information and doesn’t
print it. Second, what differ-
ence does it make if seven
girls (the LB) or eight girls
(the LB and a reporter) know
about a person‘s problem? The
person‘s hallmates probably
know about it anyway. In ad-
dition to this, there has been
an nnimpeachable record set
by past reporters tor the c
of HP regarding material of

this kind.

2. Besides the complete harm-
lessness of the reporter, such a
person can do a lot of good if
she writes the kind of stories
that have appeared in the last
two issues of the sore about the
problems considered in C of HP
meetings. The League Board
can get some publicity that it
needs badly to keep it from
looking like a police force. It is
certainly much more than that
—from talking with members of
the LB the other night, rve
