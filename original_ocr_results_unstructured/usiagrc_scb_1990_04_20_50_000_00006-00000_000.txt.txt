Pride Week
Should Avoid

Stereotypes

Lesbian/Gay Pride Week has traditionally offered the campus or
Grinneli College the opportunity to celebrate sexuality. During Pride
Week. gay and nonvgay people are encouraged to explore and be
comfortable with their sexuality, no matter what their individual sexual
orientations might be.

Pride Week also serves to extinguish existing stereotypes about gay
men and lesbians. Information. demonstrations, and other programs
provided by the college gay and lesbian community help educate the
campus about gay people. Slogans such as “we are everywhere" and “one
in ten" sensitize students to the fact that gay people exist in every facetof
society.

During the past few years. however, several aspects of Pride Week
have been detrimental to the goals of celebrating different sexual
perspectives and furthering the rights of gay people. Last year, nonegay
students were encouraged to celebrate Pride Week by “coming out" to
their parents. Students were instructed to tell their parean that they were
gay, and not to correct this statement in the future. An event like Lesbian/
Gay Pride ka ideally should discourage lying about one‘s sexual
orientation, rather than invite dishonesty about the subject.

A similarly disturbing aspect of Pride Week this year was Butch/
Femme day. On Butch/Femme day the campus was directed to dress
stereotypically Butch (masculine) or Femme (feminine), to enjoy this
aspect of gay culture and to expose the foolishness of stereotypes. Instead
of facilitating the removal of stereotypes about “butch" lesbians and
effeminategay men,Butch/Femmedayonlyreinforcedthesemisinformcd
ideas.

Lesbian/Gay Pride Week is an important event with the potential to
educate the campus about the myths and realities of gay and lesbian
lifestyles and culture. In the future, the organizers of Pride Week should
be careful to plan only events which are conducive to furthering the goals
of the gay community.

III-.‘I'I'EIIS TO THE EDITOR

Committee Protests

To the editor.

We were very disturbed by the
negative references to Grinnell's
participation in the Earth Day
celebration in last week’s Scarlet
and Black. We are particularly
upset by the lack of attempts on the
partof the reporters for the paper to
determine the reasons for this lack
of activity. The innuendo that it
was due to some lack of real
commitment to the environmental
cause was especially hurtful and
offensive to many of the people
wltoworkdiligentiyonPcace/Earth
Day on this campus.

If the Scarlet and Black had
Chosen to engage in any type of
fﬂClrﬁndIng effort, it would have
cometo your attention that April 28
isdesignatedPeacc/EarthDay. We
feel that the readers of the Scarlet
and Black have been badly
misinformed. The decision tomove
the celebration of Earth Day to be
combined with Peace Day was
based largely on scheduling
conflicts.

With Pride Week pre-sCheduied
and overlapping with Earth
Day. we felt that an attempt to
celebrate Earth Day on April
22 would place a heavy tax on
students' Lime and detract from the
celebration of both. With the
aforementioned in mind it seemed
logical and reasonable to com-
bine the indivisible ideas of Love
of Peace and Love of Eanh. It
should also beremembered that for
manyof students,likethose in EIG.
the support and celebration of the
Earth is a daily occurrence, and
should not be restricted to a single
day. Ifwcare to become fixated on
a single calendar day to show our
Love of Mother Earth, then we are
hypocritesengagcdinauselesssclf»
aggrandizin g effort.

Lastly, we feel that the Scarlet
and Black staff were callously cold
in their reporting. They deeply

saddened those of us who have
put a great. deal of time and errori
into the Peace/Earth day
celebration. Both the calendarand
Mr, Rugg's rude comments
bit very deep. Perhaps, if the
Scarlet and Black had been less
lax in their duty to report campus
events, they and the student
population would be more

Several Events Planned for
20th Annual Earth Day

To the editor,

In response to R. Keith Rugg's
cartoon which suggests Grinnell
College apathy to environmental
issues, we would like to Communie
Cate that several events are being
planned for the celebration of the
Earth. On Saturday April 28, any-
oneinterested in apotlatchpicnic at
Krumm NaturePreserve anda high-
way trash cleanup can meet in the
forum parking lot at 10:30 am.
Instead of having two major cele-
brations on consecutive weekends,
this year, members of E16 and the
Peace Day Committee decided to
combine Earth Day activides with

those on Peace Day;which is held ,

annually on Saturday. April 28: 'By
focusing our attention on both per-
tinent topics simultaneously, we
envision an enthusiastic burst of
participation that will, perhaps.
inspire individuals to commit to
long-term involvement.

In addition to the Saturday
workshops and speakers related to
Peace and the Earth, a recycling
benefit concert at the Grinnell
Community Center Theatre will
mark the celebration on Sunday,
April 29 from 2-4 pm. A mix of
student and community musicians
will perform to raise funds for the
town recycling program which is
preparing to collect paper, glass
and plastic milk jugs. By the time
the celebration weekend has ended,

the recycling program in town will
be receiving recyclables. This cor
incides with the college’s recogni»
tion of the dire need to institutione
alizethecampusrecyclingprogram.
By allocating some of their budget
funds, the administration will con-
tribute to the cost of a bailer for
Cardboard, a Vehicle for collection.
and permanent boxes for paper
separation in the dorms. ,
Most signiﬁcantly, in respondr
ing to the cartoonist‘s inaccurate
message, is the fact that, through
outtheyear,Grinnellianshaveacted
upon their concern for the environ-
mental crises. Dedicated students
have sorted and collected paper
from dorms and administrative
ofﬁces. organized Waste Aware-
ness Week in the fall, and attracted
full audiences to the reeentsympo-
sium talks on the implications of
global warming. These effons are
evidence of the ongoing participa-
tion essential for the promotion of
environmentallyresponsiblebehav-
ior. Individual decisions can con-
tribute to our planet‘s longevity ~
Dr demise. It seems that Grinnell
studean have been exemplary in
fostering behavior which sustains
the Earth; with continual involve-
ment by an increased number of
people, we can make the celebrity
tion last more than just one day,
