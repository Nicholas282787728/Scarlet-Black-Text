Cornell Wins, but the Decision
Very Close.

Seltlorn willi one have an opporr
ttinity of listening to a moie inr
teresting debate than the one held
in the Congregational church last
evening, Each speech showed
the most careful and painstainng
preparation. the arguments being
presented in a clear and forceful

manner.

Cornell’s representatives, partic-
ularly Messrs. l’ratt antl Waite,
showed the etiects of superior
training ill debate, while Grinnell’s
representatives'speechesexcelled
in carciulncss of preparation,

ltlr. I’inet"s opening speech to
our notion, was easily the best
effort of the evening. His
soning was logical and succinct;
his manner pleasant and convinc—
ing. .

Mr, \Vaite for Cornell excelled
all others in his ability to speak
extenlpolaneottsly. He handled
his subject well and no doubt inv
ﬁueltced the decision more large
1y than any other speaker.

Less than zoo people were in
the church while the Glee Club
sangtheirﬁrstntnnbcr. Tliegem
tletucn's literary soeieties lost
something like 550. They lcei
satisﬁed, however. that this deleat
will spur Grinllellites on to re»
neived effort so that next year we
may have the decision in our la»
vor.

The question for debate was:

“Resolved. That the interests
of the people of the,UnitedStalcs
are better served by the system
of goveinment noiv in use by them
than they would be by tllC Eng
lish cabinet system."

Limitation '

(I) The existence of the Eng-
lish Crown, the hereditary House
of Lords and other hereditary
privileges, are to be excluded as
afﬁrmative arguments.

(2) The question is to be dis
cussed upon its merits, and the
initial difﬁculties and friction
likely to be experienced in inn
augurating such a system in this
country, are likewise to be exclud-
ed as aﬁﬁrmativc arguments.

Mr. Piner's argument was based
on two main points. He showed
that our system being a system
of legal checks anti balances, guar-

rear

 

antecd the minority protection
and also it prevented hasty legis-
lation and gave a chance {or the
sober second thought of the peo
ple to make itself felt. I~Ie cone
trusted the English with the
American systcm. showing how
under the English unicanierai
system there was no check on the
majority and how legislation was
subject to every passnig whim of
the people. Ht: further showed
that modern legislation is largely
a pioccss ot the adjustment ollaiv
and that the adjustment is secured
in its perfection by our federal
system of government and our
committee system of congress.
The English system, being a
strongly centralized system, can
not to easily adjust the laws to
the local needs,

Mr. W. A. Ganﬁeld, the ﬁrst
speaker for Cornell, ladd partic-
ular stress on the unity and chic
icney oi the English government
as contrasted with the lack of it
in the American system. All blis-
ines's is done by con'lniittee‘system
in America; 56 standing commit-
tees have entire charge of legi
lation. In England one commit»
tee has cntire charge, He showed
how our executive and legislatnie
hamper each other through the
lack of knowledge of the needs of
each. This is especially tioticable
in ﬁnanctal legislation. Mr. Ganr
ﬁeld also showed that our. system
gave great temptation to logrlollr
ing, and also that it reduced the
interest of the nation in legislation.
Mr, Ganﬁcld spoke a triile too
fast. while on the whole he ltantir
led his subject well.

B. C. Marsh, ’98, for Giinnell,
argued that the English system
had never been tried under dent»
ocratic conditions; that the great
lltassof the English people havt:
been cniranchised in the last gen»
eration. The English people are
conservative; the Americans are
not for l4 per cent of our popula
tion are foreign bbrn and have not
that great respect for existing cone
ditions that the English have.
our government has lasted tor
tto years, and as governments are
to be judged by wltat they accomr
plish. what government on the
face ol the globe has ; mnplish-
ed as much as ours? . tu “curiae
ment is a government slow

 

growth. There is a total absence
of hasly legislation. This is see
cured by two coordinate houses,
an independent executive and ju-
diciary. Mr. Mai-sh closed with
a slight peioration on the United
States Senate, Supreme Court antl
wt'lllcnConstitution Mr, Marsh's
manner was easy and his enuncia-
tion excellent.

R. W Plan, '98, of Cornell. are
guetl that a cabinet government
does not necessarily mean a got/r
erninent without a constitution.
and Cited Canada as an exam-
ple, He argued that one essen-
tial of any government is its elas-
ticity, i. c.: its power to meet
changed conditions. and cited
Buchanan's and lollnson’satlmin»
istrations as instances where our
government was too iigid,

in America there is no relation
between the need and time of an
election. English oFﬁcials do not
serve according to the almanac
but elections occur only when
necessary. Responsibility isavital
necessityinapopular government.
lrresponsibility is a source of core
ruption. The American system
is a system of iriesponsibility
owingtothesystemntlcgalchccies
and balances. and hence does not
meet this requirement,
there is iircsponsrhility there is
corruption, and this is a vital cvtl
of our system.

Mr. l’ratt produced a very ia-
vorable iinpre sion by his earnest
and roicible manner of present.
ing his case. He possesses a le-
marlrably pleasing \ orec and man-
ner. .

Mr. Paul l’eclt, '97, was the last
regular speaker tor Grinnell. Mr.
Peck opened his speech with a re
Litittal of Mr. l’ratt's point that the
English cabinet system can exist
under a written constitution. He
expatiated to some length on the
instability of the govcl‘nlllentvtlnr
dcr the English tem and
showed by the citation of the
home rule party that a small tilin—
ority can contiol the majotity.
English executive is composed ot
men not ncce ‘lly noted lortlieir
administrative ability but for their
oratorical powers. The English
system would have to be intro-
duced with all its faults as well as
its cxeellencrcs, and Mr. Peclt be-
