THE ‘FIRE BAWI.’

To most of the less sentimental students of
Grinncll college, the burning of the women’s
gym merely meant a beautiful fire and an
exciting event in a rather dull week. How-
ever, to the college administration it meant
terrific e pense and the cheerful task of
approaching the alumni and trying to raise
money for a new building. To the women’s
physical education department it meant the
loss of expensive equipment and a fairly
satisfactory place in which to carry on its
work.‘ To the drama department it meant
the loss of materials accumulated over a
long pc 'od of years. To the boys in the
college' orchestra who kept their instru-
ments in the gym, it meant the loss of three
or four hundred dollars worth of equipment.
To many of the coed students it meant the
price of a new gym suit or tennis racket.
To other persons not quite so closely con-
nected with the tragedy and who suffered
no personal loss, it meant the disappearance
of one of Grinnell’s claims to fame—the
oldest women’s gym this side of the
Mississippi. It also means the loss of a
building in which some unusually good times
have been had—dancing, roller skating, and
watching or participating in athletic events.

Saturday evening, the women’s Honor G
is sponsoring a “Fire Bawl" to be held in
the men’s gym. The party is to be a bene—
fit. The minimum entrance fee is twenty-
five cents, but any amount above that will
be appreciated. The money received will be
divided between the members of the or-
chestra who lost their instruments in the
fire and a fund for a new field house.

This is the opportunity to which the stu-
dents have been looking forward#the
chance to show that they do possess school
spirit. The best way to show this is to co-
operate and attend the “Fire Bawll"

CHOOSE YOUR OWN HYPOCRISY

It used to be the custom to sit about the
table after Thanksgiving dinner, basking ill
the drowsy torpcr brought on by mince pie,
and enumerate everything we had to be
thankful furl After Dad said well, he was
glad the depression didn’t hit his salary any
harder than it did, we were never able in
our growing discomfort to think of any-
thing but the mince pie. The gratitude
sessions were never much of a success That,
we are told, is because under the weight of
the turkey and the pie and the day off from
study the significance of a day of thanks-
glvmg has been lost sight of. We have,

we are told, forgotten how to be grateful.

But we are not too fond of the moralists
who shake their heads and say how much
human nature has changed. Certainly it is
no longer fashionable to display gratitude;
those who do are hypocrites oriworse yet
isimply goons, who are not aware that the
accepted thing is to sit around cheerfully
grlping, mince pic or no mince pie, vacation
or no vacation. There is something hearty
and wholesome about a good community
gripe. 01‘ course nobody takes it very
se ously, any more than anyone took very
seriously our gratitude to the man who
invented mince pie; we were obviously much
too uncomfortable, ,_

Perhaps we are by nature not made for
gratitude, unless we are, like the original
pal'takel's of the turkey dinner, scared into
it. ‘ And we aré not very easily scared. In
the end, since we prefer not to be too sill-
cere, there is merely the choice between two
kinds of hypocrisy.

At any rate, one version of the day of
th' nl<sgiving is once again on the point of
al iving; and who knows but that ill the
midst of the chorus of griping we may find
room for a little negative gratitude?

THE GRINNELWET

A molltll ago, the Scarlet and Black pre»
sented three editorials about student scl -
government at Grinnell. These editorials,
by their nature, were hide in scope alld
dealt with the plan of student self-govern-
ment ill general terms. There was no space
for ally description of many organizations
that have a smaller part in student affairs.
Yet many of the organizations that could
not he lncntioned last month, while more or
less insignificant in the whole scheme of
student self-government, do influence ca ,
pus life to a degree generally unsuspected
by the majority of students. The Grinnell
Y. M. C. A. is such all organization

The Y. M. C. A. cabinet consists of one
representative elected by the men of each
hall on the campus, including one each for
Macy house, Carney house, and the town
mell. Weekly meetings are held where
policies are discussed and plans are made
for carrying out the various functions of
the Y. These functions include putting out
the college handbook, arranging the recep—
tion held at the president’s home during
New Student Days, assuming part of the
responsibility for the general reception,
lining up dorm talent to supply music ill the
dining room, putting on a stag party the
night of the Colonial Ball, sponsoring the
drive for funds for Grinnell in China,
assisting ill staging the annual Red Cross
roll call, sponsoring the Uncle Sam’s Club
dinner, arranging the all—men‘s dinner, and
sending a representative to the Geneva and
Palisades conferences each year.

One of the main obstacles ill the way of
successful Y. M. C A. work is the lack of
continuity of poli y and administration,
since the members of the cabinet are elected
on a yearly basis. Here the men of Grin—
nell could'help the Y by electing a well
qualified sophomore as representative, and
continuing him ill office for more than one
year. Thus each new cabinet would not
have to take office with a total lack of ex—
perienced members.

If this short discussion has thrown some
light all functions of an organization that
is a small part of your student government,
it has served its purpose. If it has cons
villced you that the Gl‘innell Y. M, C. A
helps make this college a better place, it has
been successful. But why not get really
acquainted with the Y’s many campus actir
\‘ities through the representative in your
own hall?

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“If educational stateslllanship could present
to America a generation llel'vcd to see how
much of the same must be exacted, we
should at last have entered culturally upon
our long heritage of political freedom" Uni-

England Nob
Sir Gala/lad

By William C. Harris.

Last Sunday, Britain's umbrella-
statesman turned idealistiit
must have been a terrific strain
73nd defined the English peace
arm as the establishment of a
Utopian Europe.

In the iii-st speech addressed
to the empire since the war he-
gay], England's gouty prime
minister declared that Britain
would "persevere in this strug-
gle until . . we have attained
the defeat of the aggressive,
‘hllllying mentality which seeks
to dominate other peoples hy
force, u- r finds a brutal sate
israction m the persecution and
torture oi inoffensive citizens,
nurL. justifies the l'epuiliih
lion or its own pledged word
wheneier it finds it conveni-
our."

Quote anrl unquote. And so the
muoesliuging continues. Big, bad
Hitler and good little John Bull,
who never sought “to dominate
other peoples by force," who
never persecuted or tortured “ier
offensive citizens," and who never
repudiated ”its own pledged
word." Oh ycnhithat’s what they
think' ‘

We hate to disillusiou any
charming nhglophilcs who may
accept this inure view. But it
just nilrt so. And that‘s why
we can't see that Great Brit-
nil-A’s stuffed shirts have any
justrircutiou for smearing such
drivel across the press oi this
niul othe neutral nations—and

it was to the neutral countries
as well as to the empire that
this uildrc was directed.

Sure. its true that Hitler is
dominating other peoples by
force, but what is Great Bl‘italn
doing in Palestine, India, and
South Africa” Picking daisies?
It's also true that Germany is
p ttlng the screws on individual
c' zeus. But who was it that
tied Indian natives to cannon
muzzles and blew the poor devus
to bits And who was it that door
iiuated the population of Ireland
during‘ Cromwelrs time and even
as late as the 1920's sent an army
into that same country to sup-
press nationalist uprisings? Pure,
innocent John Bull-“democra-
cy’s" little sir Galahad.

Yes, it's true that . dolphsele
(Torn keeps his word. But just
what country owes us billions
of dollars, the payment of
which it pledged upon its sale
cred honor? And what country
gyppea the italnms and the
Jews after the inst world war
by i-epudintihg agreements they
had made with those peoples to
gain their support during the
conflict? Germany or Great
Britain? And just who has re,-
pentedly promised lullia more
self-government and just as

often \vclched on those prom-
ises? ,

Now don’t get us wrong We
are not defending Hitler or his
policms Our contention is merely
this this isn‘t a war betwoerli
“good" and “bad” nations, with
the Nazis representing the em.
pire of the devil and the British
leading the forces of light. Not
hy a Jug-lull. It’s a selfish wan,
And when it comes to name
calling, it’s just another case of
the pot calling the kettle black.
