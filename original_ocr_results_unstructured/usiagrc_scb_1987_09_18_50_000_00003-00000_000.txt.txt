Students confront plight
of homeless in Des Moines

by Bruce Emorrd

During last February's Sym.
posiurn on Poverty, Mitch siiy.
der. a representative of the
Community for Creative Non.
Violence, presented arguably
the most dynamic lecture of the
session. A resident worker at
the Washington—based C(INV’s
headquarters. a facility provid-
ing food and shelter to the
homeless, Snyder‘s diatribe on
the inequities of the capital.
ist system elicited reactions of
consternation and shock among
many students present, some of
whom expressed a willingness to
help in Snyder's cause.

Unli e so many cases in which
the initial enthusiasm and good
intentions wane as academic
pressure intensiﬁes, senior David
Loewenstein and others decided
to do something about the
homeless issue in Des Moines.
Stirred by Snyder‘s mention of
the imminent closure of two
Des Moines homeless shelters,
Loewenstein founded Students
Helping the Homeless tsnn).

Loewensteiu had always been
interested in the homeless, but

he ssid Snyder’s speech gave him
the motivation to participate ac-
tively in helping them. He says
his aim was to have students
confront homelessness directly,
to have them see it as a real
and pressing problcm, not as
one distant from tlleir own lives.
“Doing something like this is
so different than, say. fundraisr
ing," said Loewenstein. “Vi/ith
fundraisiug, you can‘t put a face
to the name and the probleru is
not as real. if you get people to
go and see [the probleml, it may
change their minds." Locwen-
stcin recollects one particularly
airecting moment during Suy.
cler‘s speech. “He 5 id that if
you saw a house burning down
and it had your family or friends
in it, then you'd risk your life
to save them. Mitch added
that the homeless shelters were
‘brlrning down' in Des Moincs,"
said Loewenstein.

Loewensteiu hopes that the
group will help to eradicate the
barrier of viewing the homeless
5“ different. He stated that “a
lot of people only see the capital

ofhomelessuess and that‘s it.
You have to see that the home
less are just pcople, and home.
lessness is only one of their qual-
ities."

Although only in its fledgling
stages last semester, SHH ac
complished several of its goals.
The group aided the Kindred
Community, the Des Moines or.
gauization which oversees the
Rufus Jones shelter for lnen and
its distoﬂ' counterpart, the So
journer Truth shelter, in cola
lecting signatures for n petition

close the shelters The petition

ment of homeless people. in all.

Debbie Gottschalk, a sophOs

Karen Lcllmuli and Loewen~
stein, remembers that many of
the people she talked to were

Last year, SHH also sponsored
an SGA referendum supporting
the work of the Kindred Come
unmity as well as an oncsmpns
clothing drive which Lehman de-
scribed as “very successful. We
had more stuff titan they could
use at that time.“ However.

dropped to as fcw as three on

thinks that petitioning was not

a “glamorous" task for students
accustomed to more vocal and
active forms of protest. “Peti-
troniug didn‘t appeal to people.
It was hard to get people to work
on the project," said Loewenr
stein. Gottschalk added that,
although students did not feel
that petitioning was very valu.
able, “that was what the shel-
ters asked us to do. Petition-
ing was what was needed at that
time,"

During the summer, Loewen.
stein stayed in Grinnell and
commuted daily to Des Moines,
delivering produce donated by
Food 4 Less. This semester,
Loewensteiu plans to increase
the deliveries to three weekly, on
Saturday, Tuesday, and Thurs.

are also many “white-sanded
beaches like in the Caribbean."

These beaches attract many
European tourists to Thailand.
Unlike the tourists who bake
in the sun, the Thais disdain
tanning because, according to
Karen, “the less tan you are
means you don‘t have to do la.
bor work like working in the
fields." Thais are confused by
Europeans and Americans who
are eager to get out in the
sun and “soak up some rays,"
thereby lowering their perceived
social status. Needless to say,
bikinis are a rarity among Thais.

land is run by a constitutional
monarchy; the king is essentially
a ﬁgurehead, though very im.
portant in his role. The Parlia-
ment is also somewhat powerless
in comparison with the military,
While the military has the real
clout as far as running the conne
try, it is the king who provides
the country with unity. Thais
are‘ﬁercely proud of their king,
and Karen says that the Thais
“adore the king and the Royal
Family" Although the military
is soruetirues criticized, the king
and the Royal Family arc infal-
lible. Reverence for the king is
such that one is not permitted to
step on money in Thailand he-
osuse the king’s face appears on
the currency.

Karen says that the people ap.
pear happy with their govern.
ment, and feel that they have
freedom and a say in govern-
ment affairs. Karen found the
military to be a powerful and
noticeable presence, but not op.
pressive. Apparently, most of
its efforts are centered on Thai-
land's borders with Laos and
Cambodia; the government's
fear of Communism diﬂ‘usiug
into Thailand makes the borders
an area of concentration for the
Thai forces,

Naturally. Thais have views of
America and Americans which
are very different from how we
in America might view our.
selves. Karen found that, in
general, Thais think of Ameris
onus as being very lenient anct
l‘beral. “They tlﬁnk's'tliat
alve'rc; idll ,yery romjscuous ‘

says Karen. “And everyone
[in Amcr' a] moves away from
their families at a young age,"
It is, however, very prestigious
for a Thai to receive a degree
from an American university.
And, while Karen asserts that
most Thais disagree with Press
ident Reagan and his ooli es.
they believe that America it-
self is an enviable country ,and
Americans are generally well re-
ceived in Thailand, For many
Thais, the stereotypical Ameri.
cans are the actors Rob Lowe,
Demi Moore. and Tom Cruise.
Apparently, “About Last Night“
and “Top Gun" were big hits in
Thailand.

Karen cited few drawbacks to
her trip. The tropical weather
was o bit hard on her San
Francisco-acclimated body, and
she describes getting dysentery
as “kind ofn bummer." An as.
pect of Thai society which dis.
turbed Koren was the degree of
discrimination against women.
For example, the female dorms
at the University had a curfew of
9 P.M., whereas the male dorm
was open 24 hours a day. It
is also considered improper for
women to drink much alcohol,
whereas it is acceptable for rneu
to drink as much as they please

Karen and her classmates were
able to overcome these draw.
backs. For example, Karen says
that sneaking into dorms after
hours was a fairly common prac-
tice. Karen also found being
