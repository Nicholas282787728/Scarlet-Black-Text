Pioneers strike twice;

‘ WINS not whiffsl

by Rich Arnold

After writing about the Pioneer
baseball squad’s Winless season
last week, the subject matter of
this week’s article takes on special
joy in light of Grinnell’s sudden
twoewin explosion. The diamond-
men edged Coe 5~4 behind Paul
Delaney’s strong pitching, and
stiﬂed a powerful Graceland club
3-1 on the strength of Chris
Sodoma’s d-hit masterpiece. After
being embarrassed in earlier
meetings this season with both
teams, Grinnell bounded back to
jolt them both.

Coe came to Grinnell for a
doubleheader last Saturday, intent
on defeating Grinnell at least once
in order to advance to the Midwest
Conference Baseball Tournament.
They were successful, but not
before a scare was thrown into
them. Delaney limited the
Kohawks to just five hits and four
runs in going the distance in the
first game, and was also one of the
Pioneer hitting heroes collecting
an RBI triple and a double. Paul
Crane, with a homerun and an RBI
single, and John Haigh, with two
RBI’s from a sacrifice fly and a
single, accounted for Grinnell’s
other runs.

The Pioneers jumped on Coe for
two runs in the first inning when
Tom Goetz walked, was sacrificed
to second by Mark Hanisch’s
perfect hunt, and sauntered home
on Delaney’s triple. l-laigh followed
with a long fly to center to score
Delaney. in the fourth inning,
Crane homered for a run, and in
the fifth Grinnell took the lead for
good when Delaney doubled and
was singled home by Haigh. l-laigh
was, in turn, pushed to second
when Craig Zippe walked, and
raced home with the winning run
when Crane laced a single to right.

Coe had scored two runs in the
second to tie the score, one more in
the third to take the lead, and a last
run in the fifth to regain the lead
after Crane‘s roundrtripper, only to
lose it permanently when Grinnell
scored two runs in their half of the
fifth. Delaney really mowed down
the Coe batters in the final four
innings as he allowed only one hit,
that With two out in the last inning.

In the second game Grinnell
suffered from having emotionally
peaked in their earlier win. Coe

STUDYING LATE?

exploded for 14 hits and 19 runs to
rout the diamondmen 1974. Grinnell
runs came when iiaigh singled
Goetz home with a run in the first;
Crane doubled home Haigh in the
third; Crane doubled again in the
fifth, and, after advancing to third
on an infield out, scored when
David Wynberg’s grounder to short
was mishandled. Crane scored
again in the seventh when he
scampered home on Wynberg’s
return shot to the pitcher. Zippe
was the starter and loser for
Grinnell as he just didn't have his
“stuf ” on this particular Satur~
day.

After handily beating Grinnell in
two games at Lamoni, Graceland
figured to have an easy time
winning another one up here
Monday. Sodoma, and excellent
defense, saw that they got what
they least expected, a 3-1 loss. Only
eight Graceland batters reached
base, just three on hits. as Sodoma
exercised a mastery over them. A
leadoff homerun in the fourth
robbed Sodoma of his shutout.
Sparkling defensive plays, in
eluding a gameending double
play, kept Sodoma out of many
potential tight spots.

Haigh went 3 for 3 at the plate

and figured prominently in all of
the Pioneers’ runs. In the third he
singled home Delaney, who had
earlier singled, and then, in turn
rode home on Zippe’s ground-rule
double. In the fifth he doubled and
scampered home with the third
and final Grinnell run when Zippe
singled to the fence in left—center
for his second RBI. Eleven
Grinnell hits dot the scorebook and
include, in addition to those
mentioned above, two singles off
the hat of Wynberg, and one a piecf
from Goetz, Dan Edwards. and
Charlie Fuson. These three runs
were all Sodoma needed to nail
down his first Pioneer baseball
victory.
Earlier in the week the players
selected Paul Delaney as the team
MvP, a deserving, but nonetheless
difficult, choice. Charlie Fuson and
four year starting second baseman
Mark Hanisch played their last
games as Pioneers yesterday, and
both will be missed on next year’s
team.

f0r conference
Win at Beloit

hy Gordy Malaise

' The Grinnell golf team took a
giant stride towards the con—
ference title this week in a two-day
road trip, winning the Beloit meet
and placing a close third at
Monmouth.

Consistency was the key in
taking the honors at Beloit as only
six strokes over 27 holes separated
Grinnell's first four placers:
Arturo Tapia, Mike Hopkins, Dave
Vanderpool, and Al Jessen.
Grinnell edged Carleton, Ripon,
and host Beloit with a score of 479
to second place Carleton’s 481.

Coach Edd Bowers was pleased
with the third place finish, Seven
stokes off the pace, on Monmouth 's
appropriately named Gibson
Woods course. Knox won the meet
by a slim one stroke margin over
Monmouth, followed by Grinnell
and Cornell. Powerful Dave
Vanderpool’s tenacious practice
paid off as he took second medalist
honors with a 75, despite incurring
three penalty strokes on the
Wooded links.

Gibson Woods is the type of
course which puts a premium on
iron nerves and cool heads in order
to withstand the arboreal-induced
pressure and keep the ball in play.
It is on this course that Grinnell is
described as having an outside shot
at the conference title, providing
everyone plays consistently. A
sobering factor, however, is the
lack of depth on the Pioneer squad,
as it now appears only four men
will go to the conference meet next
week.

Hall, Nadalsky winners

by Mark Bowman

Chip Hall's javeiin throw of my and Mike Nadalsky's leap in the
triple jump of 43’5" were both good enough to take first place in tho
Coe Relays as both men continued their consistent winning, Grinnell
grabbed a fifth place finish at the nelays which was their final warm-
up before the conference meet to he held May 16 and 17 at Knox
College. Other men who placed at Coe were Mark Schultz. who took
third in the 100 yard dash, Mark Bowman, who finished fifth in the «a
.yard dash, and Kurt Krutilla who also earned a fifth place Iinlsh m the
triple jump,

As far as the conference meet is concerned, the best bets for
championships according to Coach Maurice Hunt are Hall in the
javelin, Nadalsky in the triple jump, and Jim Briles in the 220, 440, or
no yard dashes, depending upon which events he enters. “With the
talent \ve have, there’s no way we should finish anywhere but the
upper division,” said an optimistic Coach Hunt.

Netmen bouncing around

by John Lom

It was a yoeyo of a weekend as the Grinnell tennis team suffered one
of its worst setbacks, only to recoup and claim one of its finest vic-
tories of the season. This past Friday, Grinnell was pinned with an 8-1
loss at the hands of the Carleton Carls. What was supposed to be a
close match turned into a rout as the Carls took advantage of a
tired Grinnell squad. Despite the victory by number 5 singles man
Aaron Silverburg, 6-4, 6-4, the Pioneers had little to cheer about.

One day later, however, Pioneer fortunes changed for the better. In
their last home match of the season the Grinnell squad plastered a
beleagured and slightly talented William Penn team, 970. it was the
first Pioneer shutout of the season as each Pioneer won in two straight
sets. incredibly, the toughest match for a Pioneer was Carter
Newton’s Gel, on victory.

The hot and cold netmen, finishing their regular season action
tomorrow at Beloit, are now queuing up for the May 15-16 Midwest
Conference meet in Monmouth, Ill.
