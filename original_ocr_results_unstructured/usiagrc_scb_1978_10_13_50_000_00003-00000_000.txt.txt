Mobilization For Survival are to:

Geographer Nunley uses folk music in cul

by Dan Flynn

In a world of intense academic
specialization, Robert Nunley
stands out as a man who integrates
several diverse areas into a
cohesive program of study,

Nunley, a geographer from the
University oi Kansas, was here
Friday, Sept. 29 to talk about the
“Historical Geography of Costa
Rica," adding his unique insights
through the use of Latin American
folk songs,

ALTHOUGH A competent
traditional geographer, Nunley
attempts to go beyond that in his
work, Aside lrom using the
traditional tools of geographers, he
has gained expertise in the use of
computers and music in describing
cultures,

Nunley feels that it is almost

impossible to accurately com-
municate an area’s “feel” using
only words or statistics. “If you
really want to get the feel of a
culture.” Nunley asserts, “you
listen to the songs the folk sing, Not
lolk songsibut the songs that the
people sing. In these songs one can
iind the thoughts and particular
ieelings oi the people.”

SOME OF TIIE songs that
Nunley plays (or his audiences and
classes are done in English
translation, but often he does them
in the original native tongue “The
meaning may be in the words, but
it doesn'thave to be. The beat sets
up a mantra that creates the
mood," he says “Often the words
are just nonsense words. but
nonetheless the beat conveys a
strong feeling "

Harvard Busmess School is committed to

He stresses that his use of the
songs is not intensely scholarly. He
points out that in the past, iirdepth
Studies have been done on the
theory and philosophy of folk
music But that's not what he's
after “Playing the songs," Nunley
explains, “imparts an aspect of the
people that i can't show in
statistics. Verbal description, too,
falls short of the aspect of the
songs.“

BUT SONGS AREN'T the only
thing different about Nunley's
presentation of geography. He also
uses computers extenswely to tree
him from the tedious and time
consuming task of calculation.
“We achieve an intellectual
wedding of computers and
geographers,” Nunley asserts.
“Each contributes what he does
best: the person supplies the
assumptions. and the computer
works out the results of those
assumptions,"

Using this method, Nunley and

 

Kansas, was made independent
when Nunley and his colleagues
tired of the administrative hassles
and red tape that they encountered

his colleagues have been able to ‘

duplicate the lifetime Work of
another geographer in a matter of
Weeks.

BESIDES TEACHING at
Kansas, Nunley is also president of
Child, Inc., a private lab that does
research and development With
computers in the study of
geography. The lab, originally
connected with the University of

with Kansas. “By selling the
equipment we develop. the lab is
ableto pay for itself.” according to
Nunley '

One of the products developed by
the lab is a computergraphic

With this device the scientist
programs his assumptions and
data. Then, the computer screen

creates a visual representation of
what these facts imply, If this
output does not correspond to what
the geographer knows exists, he
then can quickly alter his
assumptions until the computer
analysis corresponds to reality.

BY ADDING MUSIC and
computers to the traditional study
of geography. Robert Nunley feels
that he comes closer to the Ben-
aissance ideal of education. An
educator, according to him, should
be “a jack-oi-ali-trades, and a
master of one." Nunley’s mastery
oi geography. coupled with his
interest in music and computers,
make him a diverse and unique
educator.
