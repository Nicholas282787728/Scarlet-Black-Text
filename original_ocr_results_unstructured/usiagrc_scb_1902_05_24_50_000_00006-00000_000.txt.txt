and a tow )Eai’s lati‘i' lie was found

flom lSUS Mr. Price seived his couir
try as CounseiGeiiei-al at Mai'sailles,
France, by General Grant's appoint»
meiit, During that time the begin-
ning ot the struggle between France
and Prussia led to the expulsion oi
all German consuls irom France. The
German government then requested

the American Secretary oi State, Mr.‘

Fish, to order the American consuls
in France to take charge or the inter-

H. H. Belneld, A, ,\i. Pli. D., a mem-
ber oi' the class at '58, the last to
graduate at Davenport, is one oi whom
his Alma Mater speaks with pride,
He chose the teaching protession, but
like others, was interrupted in his
career by the war. As an ofﬁcer in
the lowa Cavalry Volunteers, he saw
much active service, engaged in many
battles and spent some time in South-
ern prisons. Returning to his chosen
work atter peace was secured. Mr. Bel-
heid became in 1876 a high school
principal in Chicago, and eight years
later accepted the position which he
has so long tilled witii distinguished
ability and success, that or Director oi
the Chicago Manual Training School.
Not all his energies are absorbed in
his daily labors tor the school. He
has w tteh and spoken much upon
educational and literary themes, has
traveled at home and abroad making
studies for the Government as to
technical and trade schools, and has
also home his tuil share oi‘ local and
civic duties.

The transportation or the college
from the border oi the state to its
center, together with the years otcivi
strii‘e which nearly emptied the col-

lege balls at their young men, led to,

a break in the succession ot classes.
and it was seven years lictore the ﬁrst
Griiiiieli graduates received their di~
memos and degrees. Since 1867 no re-
voli'ing year has tailed to send out
from the college a body of earnest
