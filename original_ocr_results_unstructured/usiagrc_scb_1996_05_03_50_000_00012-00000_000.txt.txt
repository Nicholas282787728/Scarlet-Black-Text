David Rudel’s Column
To the Editor:

Trudging through the muck that
David Rudel slings weekly in your
paper sufficiently enraged me to the
point that I feel his statements de—
serve a response. Franldy, I think it
is perhaps time to set the record
straight on several of the issues Mr.
Rudel has raised since his column
became a regular feature.

Mr. Rudel’s first column ad-
dressed the misrepresentation otrwo

prominent bigats, Rush Limbaugh
and Pat Buchanan. These figures are
obviously misrepresented on (any
pus, Limbaugh is seen as a loud and
loathsome Republican who is too
cowardly to actually lay it on the line
and run for office because ofhis fear
of an actual challenge to his outra-
geotis notions and atpublic scrutiny

them, perhaps Rush would have lost
some weight. They would also have
found that one ofthe greatest propo<
nents of rainily values is now married
to his fourth wife, setting standards

hand, is certainly not a hypccriie,

Now let me quickly touch upon
the Reagan years. There are two
important features of the Reagan
years which have screwed us all. the
first is tax cuts for the wealthy and
the second is the deficit From 1980
to 1989, taxes were down for the
richest one percent of Americans by

wealthy people paid less taxes, the
government had less revenue So we
are now all stuck with trillions of
dollars of debt. But frankly, that’s
not the problem. The problem is
that when we had to raise taxes again,
during President Bush’s administmr
tion, so we could try to make tip some
ofthe money we lost during the Re.

recession, And the repercussions
continue- remember how we almost

Student Publications’
funding proposal

Editor's hate the following is

publications to express our concerns
with the way- publications are cur.

smac, cccs, the ACC, the

because we feel mar rrudenrs should
be aware of the siruaticri, since it
does iiii-alie student runds.

publications. each unique in its
content and in its focus—the Scarlet

Review as well as overseeing the

SPARC is responsible for selecting
[lieedﬂolsofeﬂcliptlbllcﬂtlon,acting
as a liaison betneen the publications
and the administration, budgeting
funds for the publications from
SPARC'sgeneralfundanddisbursing
funds when required.

Currently. these student
publications teptesenrthe besteffotts
of a few students struggling with an
inadequate system offinancing. We
believe that the manner with which
student publications are handled on
this campus needs to be revamped.

The single largest concern we
have with the current system is
financial. SPARC’s general fund is a
pottionofthe Student Activities Fee,
which is divided between SPARC
(25%)andtheStudentGovetnn‘ient
Association (75%). In monetary
terms, SPARC's allotment is about
525,000iorcachacademicyear. This
figure is grossly inadequate
consideringtheevpenseorpublishing
today. the cost ofvutually every kind
of paper, whether newsprint or
magmlne paper, has gone through
the roof in the last the years. The
scarlet & Eiact, for example, has
seen its printing costs rise by about
20% this academic year alone, and
every other publication is faced with
similatsiiuntions

\Vhar this rise in priming costs
has meant for us this year is that
nearly every publication is over its
budget, some by ihcusandsordoliars
The Cuttent system is too rigid to
adapt to these rising crisis, however,
and student publications will no
douhi go over budget next year, and
the year arisr, and the year after. .

SGAandaskingforgrantsfromDean
Crady and President Ferguson, all of
whom have helped us out in some
capacity. I would also like to point
out that most of the publications
have rcrrained from doing anything
out of the ordinary, and thus
expensive, yet we are still unable to
make do with the funds from the
student activities fees

Another matter we would like
to bring to your attention is the fate
of Grinnell Comics Publishing, a

and as a result have to make do with
inadequate and outdated equipment
because we cannot afford to replace
it.

One suggestion which we have
broughttotheattentianoiscAand
Dean crady is simply to increase the
percentage of the student activities
fees which SPARC receives from
25% to 30%. it is doubtful that this
proposal would have solved our
budget problems entirely. but it
certainly would have helped,
