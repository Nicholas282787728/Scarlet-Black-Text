Editor Scarlet and Black:

Your article or Wednesdays 3. and
B. regarding the new Dartmouth pro-
gram interested me very much. A
student ought to maujre at college a
clearrthinklng brain and it background
through which his brain can function. ‘
The proposition advanced in the Dart!
mouth findings appears to be entirely
practical and far in advance of pres-
ent programs.

All present, the student attempts to
record, organize and assimilate a.
quantity of information, in a. short
time and under adverse circumstances.
Contact with instructor is frequently
negligible.

By the Dartmouth proposition he has
an opportunity to thoroughly organize
his infol‘mzltlbu, assimilate it, and 1
compare his experience with instruct—
ors and students. Waste time is used.

Your article and the one to which it
refers ls worthy of col eful Considerar ‘
tion
