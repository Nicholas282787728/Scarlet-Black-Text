SeniOr Cars, Unlimited Cuts
Get New Quarters Take Ettect Next Semester

At a special student meeting this afternoon, President
Howard R. Bowen announced several revisions of policies
and rules which will affect the Grinnell social program M3.-
101 changes involve the car rule, additional opportu ties
fol coeducational recreation and class attendance policies.

Referring to the great amount
of discussion which has been
diIected to the social program
in recent months, he praised the
constructive efforts of student
and faculty groups which led to
the changes. He cited in partic»
ular Student Council, League
Board, c of HP, student round-
tables, Committee on the Fresh-
man Year, Faculty Executive
council,'Board of Trustees and
Deans Evelyn Gardner, Harry
Grace and Homer Norton.

“The time has come,” he said,
“when the results of this dis
cussion can. be translated into
certain changes in our social
rules and social program. Our
attention can then be shifted
to other Important matters."

Bowen explained his an—
nouncement was not intended
to constitute final statement
of rule revisions, but rather
to indicate fundamental ideas
which will he carried out in a.
new book of rules and infers
mation issued in the fill,

"The principle underlymg our
rules," he said..“is to encourage
high academic and civic stand-
ards while interfering as little
as possIble in the lives of our
students.”

Following is the substance of
ms announcement on matters
affecting social and academic
Iiic at the college.

Class Attendance

President Bowen read from a
resolution of the faculty passed
on March 19. "A part of educa—
tion IS attendance at meetings
of classes and laboratories and
participation in the give and
take of class discussion . . . (A
student‘s) responsibility is not
merely to pass examinations
but to contribute to the educa-
tional prccess,. . . A student is
expected, within reasonable
limits, to attend classes £or
which he is registered. n is the
intent of these (revised) regu—
latlons to give the student a
reasonable freedom and a.,dc-

Candidates for Military Ball Honorary Cadet Colonel were humiliated by men’s halls Monday

night. They are,

k Kirkpatrick bcnpuer, Anne Sheldon; front row, Lyn Ayrcs, Anne Patterson, Della Narcissi, Liz Halvorson

grcc of responsibility with re-
spect to class attendance while
safeguarding the interests of
the college."

Required attendance during
the 24-hour period before audl
aitcr vacations and at the be-
ginning or the second semester
will continue. Although a stu-
dent who is absent Item class
at other times is not relieved
irom responsibility for class
work during his absence, it
will be up to the individual
faculty member to demrmine
the effect of absences ~upon
grades in his course.

Students absent from an-
nounced hour and ﬁnal exams
will be required to obtain a
permit from the dean before
taking a make-Lip exam. The
baccalaureate ‘and commence-
ment attendance requirement
for graduating seniors will con—
tinue.

Honor System

The Premium expressed hope
a college-wide, student-adminis-
tered honor system will be
established for both written as
signments and exams. Mean—
while, he announced, Instructors
are authorized at .their own dis~
cretion to place students on their
honor in particular courses, and
are encouraged to do so.-

“When this is done,” he said,’

“students will be required to

sign an appropriate pledge at

the end of each written docu-
ment."

(Related to this matter is a
request: presented by Student
Council President Art Travers
that instructors place sample
copies of their examinations in
the library for . student ref-
crence. The faculty voted to try
the proposal In 1956-57 by plac—
ing on file complete examina.
tions‘ or a set of sample ques-
tions.)

Car Rule

”Student: automobiles present
a serious' problem on every
campus wher’e they are per—
mltted,” Bowen said, citing such
problems as excessive weekend-
ing, ac dents, traffic congestion
and “perhaps most important,
social discrimination between
those who can and who cannot
afford cars."

he pointed out,
the car has hecomean «tall-
lished part of the American
way of life and it is presumed

However,

or near-adults
permitted to use

that adults
should be
them.

“in the discussion of the car
rule at Grinnell,” he Continued
”students have given more at-
tention to the advantages of
Cars than to the serious disad-
vantages. Nevertheless, polls
notwithstanding, (here is a sub—
stantial block of thoughtful stu-
dent opinion in opposition to
the introduction of cars."

The President went rm to
.say the college should move.
slowly and cautionllsly in
the car rule. As a first stay,
and on an experimental basis,
he announced, seniors will be
permitted to have calls at
Grinnell during the academic
year 1956-57. A few simple
rules and regulations will be
