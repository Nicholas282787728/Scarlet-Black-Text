Faculty rejects new evaluation procedure

by Mark Mayer

The faculty voted 30 to 29 at last Mon-
day’s faculty meeting to reject an
Executive Council proposal to replace the
current system of student evaluation of
faculty members' leaching performances
with an endsofscourse evaluation system,

The Executive Council’s proposal
needed only a simple majority to pass, The
faculty‘s rejection of the Council's
proposal means that the presentsystem of
faculty evaluation will remain in use

"AD the proposal passed on Monday, all
professors would have been required to
distribute a standard, cndrolrcourse
evaluatioll form to all students in each
course taught. The terms. uhlch were
being drawn up by the Executive Council
and Dean Waldo Walker. were to have
been administered during the last week of
classes or during the final examination

period of each semester.

Had the faculty approved the Council’s
proposal, the endear-course evaluation
forms would have been distributed at the
end of the present semester, Yet, ac-
cording to the proposal, data gathered
would not have been used in tenure and
promotion considerations until three
semesters’ worth of data had been acr
cumulaled. Until that time, the present
system would have remained in use.

UNDER the proposed system, the
completed forms for all professors being
considered for promotion or tenure would
have been collated and summarized by the
departmental EPC and two members of
the Executive Council. Summaries of tllc
professor's teaching performance would
then have been sent [0 the Executive
Council, to the chairperson of the ap-
propriate department and, along with

copies of the individual evaluation forms,
to the instructor being considered.

AT present. student evaluations of
faculty members are based upon in-
terviews conducted with 40 randomly
selected students who have taken one or
more courses from the professor being
evaluated The departmental EPC
members and two members of the
Executive Council, after collating the
students' responses, draw up a resume of
that teacher's performance which is used
by the Council in making contract and
tenure decisions,

new Walker begun the meeting by
stating he felt the present system of
evaluation was “inadequate and flawed"
due to the low number of students in-
lerviewcd.

Professor at Chemistry Luther
Erickson. a member of the Executive

Council. also spoke for the proposal. The
present system, he claimed, is unreliable
due to the ”disproportionately large
amount of weight placed on_ each
response.” He claimed that respondents
often have “short memories” and that
with the present system, their responses
are “subject to questionable in
terpretations by untrained interviewers "

Erickson also stated that the present
system provided no regular feedhack to
first year instructors and evaluation of
tenured professors. which he termed
“disgraceful ”

OTHER supporters of the new
evaluation system claimed that the new
system would not only provide for a more
accurate evaluation of professors but also
contribute to their development and imo
provement. which. they argued. is not

Editor, activist, author
Wicker to speak Monday

by 'l‘ iiucleinnd .

Tom Wicker. associate editor of
the New York Times, will speak on
“Who. What, and How: Crucial
influences in the Performance of
the American Press" Monday at 8
pm. in Herrick Chapel

Wicker. : , ll native of Hamlet.
North Carolina, has been called
“the Earl Warren of journalism,"
He has been active as an observer
of. and commentator on the
American scene since 19-19.

His interest in national issues
has prompted him to broaden his
literary horizons beyond the
newspaper world. He has written
several books, including six novels
lthree written under the
pseudonym Paul Connollyi and
[our non-fictional works: Kennedy
Without Tears 11964), JFK and
LBJ: The Influence of Personality
Upon Politics H964), Facing the
Lions 11973), and A Time to'Die
(1975).

WlCKER‘s current lmportance
and credibility as an author have
grown largely from his role as a
mediator at the Attica prison riot
and massacre in September, ism,
about which A Time To Die was
written. He was among 14 ob-

. servers tincluding such figures as
attorney William Kunstler and
Black Panther Bobby Sealel the
inmatesspecificallyasked to assist
in their negotiations for a set-
tlement, wicker took part in the
talks with 50 prison officers and
civilian workers who were taken
hostage, and pleaded With New
York Governor Nelson Rockefeller
to come to the scene. On Sep
tmbel‘ 13, four days after the
t 'al uprising, 10 hostages and 29
inmates were killed by troopers’
and officers' gunfire.

ATiiiie to Die. called by The New
Republic ”the crime of Attica as
seen through one man‘s anxieties,”
has bcen interpreted by many as a
semi-autobiographical account of
Wicker’s life as an Eastemer and
newspaperman burdened with
guilt. Wicker referred to himself in
the third person in the book, and
described himself as a seemingly
successful journalist who felt
“overweight, afﬂuent beyond his
sense of decency, a writer who

 

feared he had written nothing that
would last , . . a disappointed man

who felt) he had fallen Short,”
Wicker saw the Attica story. he
u rote. as one “that might make
him think better of his work, even
of his life,"

A TIME to Die received mixed
reviews from Wickcr's colleagues,
the press. In one harsh summary
,entitled The Testament of Uncle
Tom Wicker." by M J. Sobran, Jr
of the :\1Ill0|lal Kevieu, the book
was labelled as "terribly silly,"
and Wicker t"a sucker for the
rebels”) was accused of assuming
that “his narrative devicei
advocacy disguised as a stream of
consciousnessirelieves him of the
obligation to be lucid." The New
Republic. although it questioned
whether Wicker's guilt “is not too
personal a burden to ask others to
share." felt that “this painfully
and at times embarrassingly
honest book . , has the value and
virtue or being one more voice
confirming that the carnage of the
final solution need not have taken
place."

In recent years Wicker has. with
increasing frequency. adopted the
stance of a participant in events,
rather than that of an impartial
observer. He openly supported
presidential candidate George
McGovern in 1972 (a move he later
regretted, calling his repoi-torial

bias a “journalistic sin"), and.

called on his audiences to “engage
in civil disobedience" in protesting
the Vietnam war. He also con-
demned the Nixon ad-
ministration’s habits of allegedly
requiring “the invasion of two
countries and the bombing of three
to evacuate one," and accused
Nixon of creating “the beginnings
of a police state." He was later
revealed to be on Nixon's “enemies
list.”

WICKEK claims he has suffered
some professional ostracism as a
result of his activism, saying that
“there is a mainstream oi jourr
nalism, and if you get out of the
mainstream . . off the raster
vation, you feel it. t feel more
support today from the public. and
less from my peers in the press
corps,"

In 1968. Wicker was named an
associate editor of the Times and
currently writes a column for the

U.S. farmers face hardship

by And y Strauss.
JohiiStra ' and
Jim Sti’ickler

Demands tor parity by militant
farmers in recent months have
called national attention to the
economic plight facing American
farmers,

The center of the agitation has
been the American Agriculture
Movement (AAM), which is
leading the three month old farm
strike.

FARMERS have had to contend
with drastically reduced grain
prices recently, Chuck Wengert, a
governmentofficial in Montezuma,
outlined the drastic decline. In
l975, he said, corn was selling [or
around $3.00 per bushel Today it is
about $1.80. Soybeans have also
been hit hard. Two years ago, they
Sold for $10 to $12 per bushel but
now they are going for $5.50.

The AAM started Simultaneously
in Maryland and Colorado late last
year. Its formation was prompted
by these economic hardships as
well as by droughts, floods and
other natural disasters which have

affected many farmers throughout
the US recently. Hardest hit have
been wheat farmers of the
Colorado-Kansas area and farmers
in the Southeast. Both have ex-
perienced marginal crops in the
past several years.

INITIATED \Vilhout recognized
leaders, the AAM appears to he
unconcerned wtth permanent
organization, They formed to
Organize the strike and when it is
over, they plan to disband.

Jcri'y Boyle, lowa represenr
tative of AAM. stated Tuesday
night at a panel discussion held
here on the farm strike that far-
mers must begin to be assertive if
they are to regain the slim profit
margin that will enable them to
live a normal life.

“’l‘llF. prices farmers receive for
their products are out of tune with
the American economy We want a
simple. rational law so that con
sumeis cannot buy. our products
for less than parity,” he said.

"Parity” is the foundation for
the recent farmer activity and is
an important, though conr

 

troversial, concept when con-
sidering the recent farmer
struggle, On a broad levelt parity
matches farm income with non
farm income, whereby the far
mer's prices are tied to the
national economic pattern, Should
the price that a farmer receives for
it commodity be imbalanced with
his costs of production, he
demands governmentguaranteed
favorable prices, or “parity,” The
government does this by paying
the farmer the difference between
parity and market price.
OTHER concerns of AAM.
besides the achievement of parity,
include the creation of a committee
of agricultural producers to advise
the government on its agricultural
policy In addition they seek
limited importation of all gouds
currently produced by domestic
agriculture, and the announcement
of farm programs by the govern
lnent far enough in advance so that
producers can make plans ac-
cordingly.
The strike. according to Boy‘lc. is
