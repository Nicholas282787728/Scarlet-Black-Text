What’s Going On?

One of the strong selling points of a small college is
the opportunity to have intimate and frequent contact With

members of the faculty and administration . . .

it says in

all college catalogues. This is generally true, but the presi-
dent of the college is an exception. One hears stones from
other colleges of unplanned coffee hours at the president’s

home, talks with him at the union,

social contacts with him.

and similar informal

This is the sort of thing that promotes good feeling,
understanding, and mutual respect between tlle adminlst

tion and the students. When

it is absent the president is

a mere figurehead in the eyes of the students, and a great
deal of bad feeling, misunderstanding and disrespect result.

The amount of informal contact with the president of
the college has left much to be desired in the past. We
realize that this is due in part to the heavy duties of the
president, but we hope that this defect will be righted in
the future. One thing that would have contributed enor-
mously to this end is for the students to have had a role in
the selection of a new president—if not an active role, at
least a role as spectators.

But no students have met with the nominees. No plans
for such a meeting have been announced. No reports have
been made to the student body about the procedure of
selecting a new president, or the progress being made. We
realize only too keenly that we have no say in the choice
of a new president. ’

But wouldn‘t it have been possible, simply as a token
of recognition of the students’ interest, to have consulted
the students on the matter of what qualities they regard
as desirable‘in their president? Isn‘t it possible to inform
the students of the procedures and progress of ,the com
mittee to select a new president?

Members of this committee and members of the Board
of Trustees have visited Grinnell during the past fell
months. We know their schedules have been busy, but the
time spent in consulting and informing the student body
Would have payed dividends in terms of future administra-
tive-student cooperation and understanding.

We urge the Student Council to extend an invitation
to the committee to select a new president to appear be—
fore the students, tender them a report, and consult their

wishes before the important

Letters

To The Editor:

Having read with satisfaction
the editorial of November 5
concerning the triple cut rule
and its effective prohibition of
my straying from campus on Or
about November 25, I was moved
to add some personal fuel to the
fire.

in Support of the present
stringent rule, the adminisuh.
tlon propounds the follcwihg
arguments: (1) Because of dis-
ﬁance, most students couldn't
leave anyway, (2) Professors be-
come distressed at handling inc
finetesimal classes immediately
before and after holidays, and
(3) the cost of closing the col-
lege is too great.

Effective against the first
point is the fact that the horse
drawn shay has withdrawn from
the scene, and that railroads and
bus lines am probably here to
stay. Also noteworthy here are
the mmllment statistics: 15% cf-
the studente (give or takea half
dozen) reside in bordering states,
or in Iowa itself. Hence, 25% cf
the student body directs adminr
istrative policy!

On point number two, l should
think it would be the students
who feel distressed about miss-
ing several hours of worthwhile
inculcation because of their ab-
sense; and unless salaries are
docked in proporticu to attend-
ance, i seriously doubt that the
faculty will suffer irreparable
harm. The third bit of wisdom.
however, proves the most inter-

decision is made.

Crossley Presents
Bass Voice Recital

Duane Crossley (music) will
present a bass voice cecilul next
Friday night at s p.m. in Her-
rick Chapel.

He will feature l/talian,
French, English, and American
songs. Lullye, Cavulli, Falcon—
ieri, Purcell, Britten, Ireland,
and Niles are some of the com-
posers whose works will be rep-
recented. Also on the prcguam

will be a group of songs by

Brahms. ,

Crossley, for his final humr
her, will sing the prayer ,and
death scene from Boris Godo-
nov. The college choir will
assist him in his selections from
this Mussorgsky opera.

Before intermission, Norman
Gocdlbrod (music), who will
accompany Crossley, will play
selections by Claude Debussy.

This recital is the scccumiu

itiated last week by the violin
recital of Otto Jelinek (music).

Faculty Presen’rs Interesting,
Bul' Disappointing "Don Juan"

by Martha Kelly

Tuesday night‘s faculty reading of “Don Juan in Hell”
was an interestlng and stimulating experiment for the
Grinnell stage. Unfortunately, it did not measure up to

expectations
The cast seemed a little

condesceding, as though they

felt they must emphasize the obvious and brush off any

subtleties for the benefit of
their college audience. Thcy
were a poised group, seemingly
completely at ccsc cu the stage.
The c h a r c c t e rizations were
clearly differentiated, but in
some instances sloppy and ill-
prepared.
Played As ram

The first half of the produc-
tion might almost be called the
time that a pipe, 3 bottle, and
a shawl starred in “Don Juan
in Hell.” The concentration on
props was very distracting. it
was played like a farce at times,

They pointed up the laugh
lines, which was good because
it was genuinely funny, but
they played down the serious
sections ,m‘ at least the sections
they considered over the audi-
ence's head, so much that it
came dangemusly close to be-
ing a farce. By doing this me
show lacked point, and ap—
proached being a comedy rou—
tine.

Stratton Consistent

Frank Stratton (formerly
with the music department) as
Don Juan. showed considerable
sensitivity and feeling for his
part. He seemed to have the
nwst consistent and best pre-
pared part. He appeared to be
the most conscientious about
the whole thing and to have
fhc best over-all impression of
the play, though he lacked the
strength to hold the play to-
gather.

This was partly his Own fault
and partly the fault of the rest
of the cast. Although he was
difficull to hear at times and
lost some very good speeches,
his interpretation was honest
and he seemed to be fair to his
audience.

Harold Clapp (French) made
a cynical and amusing Com-
mander. He showed understandr
ing of the part and would have
been excellent had it not been
for his occasional inaudibility.
During the first half of the play,
his pipe Was a major distraction.

Ana Coarse

Odette de LeCluse (French)
played a slightly too coarse
Ana. She handled herself and
her lines efficiently although
her scarf Semed l0 give her a
little trouble.

Rowland Chase (speech) had
the most theatrical, clearecut,
and entertaining character. His
presentation, however, seemed
sloppy. The whole performance
was thrown together. From an
experienced theatre man, the
upsfcgiug, anticipating lines, and
single dimensional character
seemed inexcusable. He did not
give Don Juan nearly so much
support as he could have.

Lack of Unity
rThe outstsndlng Jan“. in the
performance was the lack of
unity. There was a lack of unity
in the characterizations. With
the exception of Smitten, and
sometimes Clapp, the character's
seemed to be revolving in sep-
erate orbits of their own. Some
seemed to be playing it strictly
for laughs, and other with a
sel‘lous purpose. It wasn’t a dif-
ference in characterizations, but
a difference in purpose.

It was not really a bad per-
formance. Both the cast and the
audlEllce had fun and perhaps
I'm looking at the whole thing
too seriously. i only felt that
the cast simply did not put into
it all that they could and should
have.

California Water Color Society
Gives Exciting Exhibit In Main

by Edith Sternfeld

Booking a year‘s program of art exhibitions (most of

them necessarily “sight unseen”) is a great gamble and the
moment when a newly arrived crate is opened in the dim
light of the Quad basement is always fraught with a big
question mark—often followed by a sharp exclamation
point, sometimes by a dull period. But when the current
show by members of the California Water Color Society
emerged from its wrappings the reaction could be expressed
only by Something like this: * * " ll!!! * " *
