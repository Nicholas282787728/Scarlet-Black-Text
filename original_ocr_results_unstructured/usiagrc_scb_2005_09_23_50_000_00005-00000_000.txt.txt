Take notice, girls: you don’t need men

While these movies may sound like tired cliches, they are refreshingly complex

Look at Me (PG-13)

The name Lolita connotes a beguiling beauty ir»
resistible to older men. but the central character of
this French ﬁlm, Lolita Cassard (Marilou Barry), is
it chubby aspiring opera singer who goes unnoriccd
by her famous father. author Etienne Cassard (Jeane
Pierre Bacri). At twenty. Lolita spends much of her
rimc dcspcmrcly seeking hcr tirhcr’s npprovnl.

Look IrIMe explores selﬂperccprion, hypocrisy and
celebrity. Set mostly ‘in Paris. feelings are articulated
in cmphnric French and the ﬁlm conveys a sense of
i highly literate society. Admiring tins pursuc Eti-
enne, but he is unable to lavish this kind ofattention
on anyone else.

He ignorcs his daughter’s singing efforts. but
he also ignores his wife. Karin. despite her physical
beauty. Though Lolita’s awkv'lardncss embarrasses
Etienne, he also seems embarrassed when his pretty
wife articulates any opinion.

Lolita must believe in herselfbecause no one else
does, At times she has the annoying tendency to be
both selfedeprecating and unrealistic in her cxpectas
tions ofherself. Director Agnes Jaou'i chooses to bole
ster Lolita's self-esteem by introducing Sebastien. a
young man dcvorcd to Lolita.

This plot tum leaves the vicwcrwondcring when a
girl with body image problems mighr ever be depicted
as solving them herself. The love story is a classic one.
Boy mccrs girl. girl and boy {all in lovc. yct insecuri-
ties of girl prevent her from believing that boy can
possibly lovc hcr. However. this story line becomes
most entrancing and a scene in the night on a bicycle
becomes a memorable depiction of the urgent pursuit
of love.

Choral music accompanies much of Look a! Mr
and is an ideal soundtrack because ofth: risk and tr
Ward associated with singing. In the end, Lair/e at M:

My Summer of Love (R)

The title makes this ﬁlm sound like a trashy novel
with Fabio on the cover. but it‘s actually an incred»
ibly powerful and welledone movie that debuts rwo
talented young actresses.

The two main characters in My Summer quaw
rcprcsonr two disrincdy dirrcrcnr worlds. Morin (Nat-
alie Press) lives above her mother’s pub and has no
education, no job and no plan for procuring either.
Tamsin (Emily Blunt) is a bright. sophisticated see
cialircwhosc parents hnven'r paid cnough incnrion to
her. She has just been kicked out of boarding school
when she literally rides into Mom's life and the two
fall inro a friendship that is both incredibly unlikely
and cnrircly natural.

Mona escapes the banality and frustration of her
litc by cnrcrinngmsin’s posh world. Despite their obs
vious dittcrcnccs. the rwo girls ﬁnd common ground
in their senses of humor and form an intense sym»
biotic relationship. It is obvious that they need each

emotionally volatile ccnnccrion.

It is a movie in which nothing really hnppcns
except a relationship. and in this case that is quite
cuough.Thc girls’ relationship moves from sisterly to
scxuul ind on to somcrhing more intense and con—
suming.but the movie is not about a lesbian romnncc.
The movie is not concerned with social Commentam.
nor is it n simplc colnlng-of-age tale ofa bored girl
trapped in a dreary Yorkshire town.

It is about the desire for someone to notice and
to undcrsrind, and the intensity that can rcsulr from
such a scoring need.
