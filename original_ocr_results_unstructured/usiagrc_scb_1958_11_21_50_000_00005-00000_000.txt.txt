Champion Kohawks

by Joe Wdlka
It was all Grinnell from
start to finish at Kingston
’stadium in Cedar Rapids last
Saturday. The Pioneer grid-
ders scored first and never
lost the lead as they snap—
ped Coe’s 11-game winning

streak, winning 21-6.

The Pioneers went into the .

game with a new citense to
supplement their single—wing
attack. Coach Bob Peterson had
the gridders work on an ”A"
formation for the week preceed-
ing the Coe game, The back-
field is set up much the same
as the single-wing except John
Copeland moved 2mm his tail-
back spot to the "weak side"
of fullback Jim Lowry.

On every “A" formation
play, wingback Al Fisher
would go in motion hetora
the hall was snapped. This
strategy did meh to oonluse
the Cu ﬂelense, which was
expecting the singleewing oi-
tense the Pioneers had been
using 2|! year.

Grinnell scoring started when
Jim Simmons recovered a Coe
hdmble on the home team’s 25
yard. line. The gridders then
scored on the last play of the
first quarter with John Cope-
land passing to Lee Moses for
27 yards and the touchdown.
Copeland's kick for the extra
point was good.

One then got '13 yards on
three passes with Jerry Stone-
harger pawn: to Louis Kuudt-
son for the soon. The Plar
neers stopped the Kohnwks’
ruu tor the two extra points
and retained a. halftime lead
of 7-6.

in the first series of Grinnell
downs, Copeland passed to Fish-

er behind the Coe defense, but[

a holding penalty nullified the
play. Copeland then threw an-
other to Fisher for 26 yards and
one to Simmons for 14 yards
which put the Plo‘neers on the
Coe four. Jim Lowry went ovel
for the touchdown. Copeland’s
kick for the point was wide.

Grinnell recovered another
Coe rumhle to set up its third
touchdown. Copeland
by running wide tor 22 yards.
His pass to Ernie Rutherford
was good for two extra points.
Altogether Copeland picked up
205 yards running and passing
to push him' way over his
Grinncll record of 1042 yards

set last year. "Cope" netted 1184:
l

yards this year.

How could the Pioneers
come from a somewhat dismal
season to win over the Mid-
west conrercnce champions?
Many factors were involved,
but the biggest was the line
play of the Grinllell team.

Nolder, Hulse, Grindey, Yaki, »

Wilkerson. Weitzman. rap,
sinith, Scott and Gustavson
comprised an interior line
that was constantly stopping
Coe‘s vaunted oiiensc or mak-
ing key blocks in the Pioneer
drives. Grinnell’s secondary ,
derense held Coe’s pass com-
pletion to six for 24.

But it was n team effort thatl
won the game, aided by some‘
good strateEV by the Grinllell‘
coaching staff
