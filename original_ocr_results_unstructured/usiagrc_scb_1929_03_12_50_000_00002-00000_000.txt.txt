Alter all, the individual himself should know better than
anyone else what phases of a course he can utilize
practically. For instance, it scientically minded person

Why should he not he allowed to concentrate on that
phase of history which most closely relates to his major
interest than be pmdded into chewing what is to him

DilSTRI'CTlvr: PREPI’I‘NG.

in a preceding cdituricl an attempt was made to
state fairly the case for prepping and, at the same
time, reveal our opposition to the system. This 01)-
position is rooted in the belief that though hazing has
constructive elements, its destructive tendencies are
more numerous.

Prepping has caused needless conflict between
classes. Two ycars ago, the freshmen on upe of the
larger dormitories grouped together against the upper-
classmen in a situation marked by bitterness on both
sides. Last year the fresh of a smaller building organ—
ized in similar manner, and had there not been a come
promise, would have been willing to fight. Pr-cppipg
does run only cause class conflict but affects personal
relationships between freshmen and upperclussmcn,
There can not he good fellowship and democracy when
one person is elevated over another by the paddle.
Hazing by uddipg personal service to the duties of the
newcomer is making more difficult a problem which
in itself is difficult enough, llis adjustment to a new
environment, harder class work, and a condition or
unaccustomed responsibility.

Prepping hurts the \lppel‘classman as much as it
does the freshman. It has the same degrading effects
upon him, that slavery had, of course on a much large
el' scale, upon plantation owners in the South. Perv
serial service encourages laziness on the part cf the
recipient, while the presence of a more or less help
less victim is a temptation to his saddistic instincts.
The system is u check to his ambi on because it pro-‘
vides him with a sense of superiority and power based
on the most flimsy excuse possible, that of age,

That prepping, ideally conducted, can be of value
to freshmen. we do not question. But we do question
whether it can help him to a sufficient degree to war
rant its continuance with all its evils. After all, most,‘
of the faults hazing is designed to correct crru be tale

Tin; GRADE SYSTEM.

For the past two years. rumors have circulated
among the student body to the effect that innovations
in the Grinnell educational system can he expectcd
such. It is to be hoped that among the innovations inc
tl‘oduced there will he one to remedy the faults of the
grade system.

There can, undoubtedly, be much said in favor of
the present grade system. First, by ranking students
into five Classes, A. B, C, D, and E it has added the zest
of competition to the quest for knowledge. Secondly.
it has enabled the student to learn just how much of
what the professor considers important, he is getting
out 01 a. course, Thirdly, it has enabled the instructor
to determine how well he has gotten his main points
across to the students.

However, we do not believe these advantages are a
sufficient justification for continuing the grade system
without modification. and it would seem that the at-
tempts of the faculty to improvise a supplementary sy:
tem is a. confession of this fact.

The grade system can be indicted for the following:

1. It has set up false objectives. Under it there
has been a tendency on the part of many students to
work nut for work's sake but for a mark, They have
not been concerned so much with what they got out
01 the course as what the professors thought they got.
Grades have tended to produce good salesmen, rather
than good students, men who have depended on their
personality and their ability to bluff, rather than on
their intelligence and application, to “get by.”

2. Grades have encouraged the choice of snap
courses Naturally enough when your ordinary sales-
men goes on tour he will seek. the easiest, the most
gullible prospects he can find to Work upon. The col—
legiate salesman is no differently constituted. He
chooses the snaps, the curriculum "suckers."

3. Grades have enforced conformity to a single rigid

We therefore believe that while phases of preppingk

abolished.
