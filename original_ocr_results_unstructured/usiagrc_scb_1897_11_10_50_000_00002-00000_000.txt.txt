THe RESULT of the Ameerowa
game last Saturday isvery unsat-
isfactory trom every point oi view
and to all parties concerned, It
serves to emphasize once more
the importance oi carelully
choosing the ofﬁcials oi all foot»
ball games. Where so much is at
stake in a game it is doubly hard
tor an ofﬁcial it his sympathies
are strongly enlisted with either
side; and so, in most cases. it is
better that men be chosen who,
while they have a thorough knowr
ledge ot the game, have no direct
afﬁliation with either of the con-
testing institutions. All possibilr
ity of unfairness. lack of know
ledge or perspicuity should be
obviated before the game by the
mutual choice of competent, imr
partial ofﬁcials, And then, un-
der all ordinarily conceivable cir
cumstances, the two teams should
abide by the decisions of these ofr
ﬁcials, for they are bound by
honor and by contract so to do.
We mean to cast no reﬂections
upon any one connected with the
AmeSrIowa game in any capacity,
but with this incident, fresh in the
minds ot all as a warning, to pro
vide against possible misunderr
standings in the future.

Grinnell Institute.

The roll call again showed a
large number absent. But for all
that the meeting of last Sa‘turday
evening was very interesting and
successlul. All the members on
the regular proglam were present
and prepared.

The ﬁrst number on the pro»
gram was “Current Events” by
Marsh. The speaker gave an ex~
cellent digest of the events of the
week in quite clear form and in
goodclear'lznglisli. Itlias been
the habit to treat “currentevents”
as a number on our program with
a degree of contempt. one rush-

cs overio the reading room the
last icrv monienis Saturday .iitcr
noon, gives it hasty glance at llie
head lines at the papers, ilien
trusting to luck for something to
say about them, or else, ineiely
giving a catalog or the week's hapr
pairings. Mr. Marsh. however,
has established a different precede
ent and it is to be hoped that the
members in the future will live
up to it.

The next number was a toll: on

The Famine in indiaby Whitehill.
' The speaker showed the origin or

the famine in the caste system of
the native religion and in the ex—
cessive taxation of the British.
The number had been conscien-
tiously prepared and was iorcibly
given.

The next number was a reading
from Whitman by Dennison. The
selection was a very decided con-
trast to the pieces usually read
beiore the society.

Miss Herriott next favored the
society with a vocal solo. That
the music was thoroughly appre-
ciated was shown by the hearty
encore she received.

The next number was a paper
by Authier on Henry George.
Mr. Authier treated his subject
biographically, paying little at-
tention to Mr. George's theories.
The paper was opportune,
fully ivritlen and well read.

In exiemporaneous woile Brown
spoke on “American Diplomacy"
and Halsey on “Some Needed
Legislation.” Both did very well
indeed, fully up so the Institute
standard.

The debate too was extempo-
raucous ill name as irell as in fact.
The question was, Resolved that
the state legislation should pror
hibit football in intercollegiate
contests. Pres. McHose appoint-
ed Crawford and Smith to sup-
port the afﬁrmative and Richard-
son and Stevens to support the
negative. In addition to these
speakers Marsh volunteered on
the afﬁrmative, Brown and White»
hill on the negative. The debate
was the best so far this teini; it
was spiiitedly fought to a ﬁnish
on both sides. The decision was
in favor of the negative.
