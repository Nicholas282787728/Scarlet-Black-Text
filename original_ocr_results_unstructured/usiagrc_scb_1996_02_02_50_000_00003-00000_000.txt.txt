MILES STERN
COLUM N 151‘

While 1 have read quite a tow
columns and have noticed a few
things aboui them, this is the first
realcoliimnl'veeverwntten, lama
big fan of some Columnists. One of
the things i have noticed about the
columnists I read is that they always
have a distinct angle and personality
that people come to expect from
them. Some are pretty mucktaking,
some are pretty complaisant, and
some just shouldn't be. Before you
throw this paper down bored stiff, let
me tell you what to expect ironi me:
mighty opinionated political, social,
and economic slamming from a left»
ist perspective. Don't expect too
much in the way ofcoherence, worths
less/smug columns (after this brief
introduction) or good grammar and
syntax, I would like to stay away
from columns dealing too much with
campus life sorts of issues and focus
on the world around us (after this
first attempt). Ifltalk about art, it's
because rliat’s what i was told to
write about lfloffend you, I don't
mean to . . . unless, of course, you
represent capitalism—the only enti—
tyworth fighting to demolish. Ouch!
lcangerhaish,... Enough with the
intro, let‘s get down to business.

I must admit, I came back early
for interim (fromsuriny‘l'empe, AZ,
no less), but i really enjoyed it! I
enjoyed it forseveralreasoris (not for
the weather, mind you) but especial»
1y because of what happened in my
firstcourse—something like “Perfor—
mance Art and Multicultural lclanti»
ty" with Band Mura. The title I
misquote is vague for a reason. We
didn’t talk about pertornianee arr,
per se, nearly as much as we discussed
“multiculturalism.”

Immediately, half of you toss
down thiscolumn. . . . “More pln[i[u<
dinous phrases about that WORD in
the 5&Bthat \Vill cause Violent reac-
tions and enough bickering to turn
many people offto talking about 11‘."

That's \\ hati could see myseltsaying,
But let me explain. Several people i
spoke with in that class were upset
and wanted to get to the performance
art. They asked: Why did we spend
so much time discussing the racism
on campus, the concepts of power
and identity, and who’s responsihie
for making Orinnell a better, less
racist institution? Why did we con«
from all of these issues in a forum
dedicated to discussuig pertonnance
art? Why did we need to dissect the
elements that led to the protest by
students of color (a fine piece of
performance art)? Why] Because no
one else is doing so, at least not in
such a broad forum. imagine a group
of around fifty Grinnellians, a real
mixofstudents,sittingaroundinone
largc group (as well as in various
small groups) discussing what hap—
pened on campus last spring among
other issues. Students actually dis—

nelll I was amazed, delighted, ner—
vous. , DaVid Mura. the instructor,
felt that it was the appropriate thing
to do, and I could not agree With him
more! I understand those who want-
ed more ART, hut Mura was good
and had something to say (read his
articleson identity in Motherjones—
vol. 17, no. 5 and vol. léno. 2 among
others).

Like Prez. Brands told SGA last
spring, we have got to move beyond
mincing words and start discussing
what’s going on in terms of the insti-
tutionalized racism and general misr
understandings about multicultural—
ism on campus. Let’s discuss
"SPACE" in passing conversations.
Share some thoughts and ideas,
Charge me With saying nothing, but
let’s not close the issue We need to
find large forums for discussing these
campus issues. Remember Ed sezhe
wants the masses to speakand discuss
and change things for the better in
terms of this campus meetin‘ the
needs of every student, so come to
some SGA meetings where the issues
are on the floor!

For the first few weeks of the
semester the crinnell campus coins
inunitywas inundated ivith an ambi—
tious campaign on the port of the
college radio station, KDIC. Their
purpose—— to attract a wide variety of
shows for this semester's program
schedule Station Manager Charlie
Clark and the KDIC staff took a
broad approach that included Star
tion information tables outside the
dining halls and “Uncle Charlie"
posters in the loggias encouraging
students to apply {or shows,

“We wanted to make KDIC viSr
able," said Clark. “Make it so that
you could not go anywhere, walk
any-where without hearing about it
in one way, shape, or form." There
has been asteady decline in D] miEP
estinKDiCshowsiorthepastcouple
of years, The KDIC staff felt it was
necessary to have greater publicity
about application {or new shows be—
fore they lost all interested students.
The traditional meeting for interest—
ed Dis was dropped and replaced by
an attempt to bring KDIC directly to
students. The intent ofClark and his
staff was to encourage students, par»

ticulariy those who had never ap«
plied tor a KDIC show. in place of
the traditional meeting, Clark asked
studenls to submit applications to
the station, Clark felt that there
were students on campus who would
submit ideas for programs if they had
a better opportunity to apply.

The efforts made by Clark and
the KDIC staff have been successful
With a twenty—five percent increase
in applications this semester, Clark
is very pleased with the response the
station has received and helievesthar
new student interest will add to the
quality ofthe station “The best way
for us to make KDIC the best station
is by getting a great number of appli-
cations to get a better variety of
shows .. Whenconsitleringprograin
ming applications, the KDIC staff
looks primarily at the iorrnat of the
shows and the availability ofthe DJs.
“When you are trying to format sev—
enty~seven time slots, you need as
much variability as possible,” said
Clark The new schedule is posted
outside of the dining halls and in—
cludes shows that should interestjust
about everyone on campus. The
schedule includes more shows fear
turing jazz, world music, and other
formats not widely featured in past

semesters, Clark isenthusiasticaboiit
the new schedule and is looking iot—
ward to a successtul spring for KDIC,
KDIC began broadcasting on Thurs
day morning.
