(and up)

Roommates juggle to
relax, have fun and
strut their stuff

Matthew Phelps and Andrew
Maginniss have been roommates
sinee their ﬁrst year at Gtinnell,
when they lived on the fourth ﬂoor of
Norris. In addition to living together,
they have juggled together ever since
the first week of college

Phelps, who has juggled since
"maybe eaily middle school," didn’t
waste any time showing his ﬂoor-
mates his talent, and Maginniss,who
“sort-ofknew how to juggle," decided
to enhance his own juggling reper-
toirc nftcr he met Phelps.

"He was obviously very talent-
ed at juggling," Maginniss said of
his roommate. “He showed off to
the whole ﬂoor, and he was always
around to help ifyou got smelt."

Phelps doesn't deny making an
effort to propagate his juggling skills.
“I try to teach people around me how
to juggle all the time," he said.

Although many residents emote
tis fourth learned how to juggle in
200172002, Maginnis and Phelps
made attempts to
broaden the jug
gling community to
include more Grint
nellians.

“one year we
were at the [New
Student Orientation] activities fair,"
Phelps said. “We had an email list
of about thirty names, and none of
them showed up.“

“We did an ExCo class once,"
said Magginiss, who said that the
students who signed up had little or
no experience with juggling.

“It seems like people sort of had
goals. and onto they reaehed those
goals we wouldn't see them again," he
said. “Like if they wanted to juggle
three balls, we'd teach them that
and then we would never see them
again."

In addition to holding classes for
beginners. Phelps and Maginniss
have also been members ofGrinnell’s

Juggling Club.

“Juggling club used to he a big-
ger deal liete,but for awhile it sort of
died out completely,” Phelps said,

However, new that the weather
has been more jugglingetriendly,

Maginniss, Phelps,
and other juggling
enthusiasts have
been meeting on
Sundays on Mac
Field to juggle toe
gethcr. Some stut
dents stop by to learn how to juggle
three balls (culled “cascade"), others
stay and improve more eomplieated
tneks, such as elub juggling, passing
or foul ot ﬁve ball juggling.

"By {at any favorite thing I have
learned in juggling is this," Phelps
said as he performed a five-ball cas-
cade.

“There's nothing quite like jug-
gling ﬁve balls...The higher it is, the
more preeise it has to be,"he said

Indeed, ﬁve-bull juggling looks
challenging and impressive, but the
more dangerous trielts, such as knife
or torch juggling, wow a crowd eyen
more.

Phelps and Maginniss took three

torches each. doused the wicks 'm
lighter ﬂuid, and lit them. After
swinging them around to get rid of
the excess thud, they stood atross
from each othet and began to juggle.

First, they juggled by themselves
and onee they were hotli grooving,
they began to pass on every third
(08$,

"We're probably the only two
people here who can confidently do
that." Maginnis said of torch pass-
me.

”There are three oi four who can
pass clubs with us,” Phelps added,

While some ofthe appeal ofjug-
gling is (hit! “it looks eool," as Phelps
said, it can also be a stress elieyei-t
“Juggling three balls is just kind or
reliLVlng," he said.

“juggling would inerease drarnae
ienll r during times like Hell Week."
added Maginni _.

“It’s a great way to procrastinate
and blow off some Steam."

While neither Maginniss not
Phelps sees juggling as a primary
source orineome in the tunne, teathe
ing and learning tricks, as well as
adding to the eysegrowing bag of
juggling toys,\vlll probably continue.
