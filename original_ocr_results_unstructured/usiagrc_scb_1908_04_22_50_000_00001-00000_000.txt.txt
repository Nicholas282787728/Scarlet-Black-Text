tee has not deﬁnitely settled all the
details ot the plan as yet but has the
main outlines of the plan fairly well
worked out.

It has been round necessary to
change some teaturcs or the plan as
generally understood throughout the
school last year, when the plan was
discussed. The Glee Club concert,
which was to have heen included uti-

der the ice will be omitted and all art
course, similar to the ouc given this
year will be substituted in its place.
There were several reasons luv this
change. The home concert is a mop-

are two reasons for this, First. there
is an element of unlairness in torc-

many of whom are children or high
school pupils taking only one study.
The second reason is that there are
only its seats in the chapel and in
order to keep the lecture and recital
courses at their present standard, the
semester fee must either furnish the
entire cost or else leave enough seats

The principle underlying this apr
