To whoever ate my cheese in the Lnngaii

door asking you not to, from an earlier incident
when my lunchmcat disappeared undci- mysteri-
ous circumstancesThe principle is basic: I paid
for that cheese, so it is mine to eat. Yet you dug it
out From my starlr of food, leaving only scraps in
the bag. Now 1 have no colby—jack on my sand-
wich, and am left bewildered by this stunning
display orcallous disregard for my lunch. 1 will
accept anonymous donations of cheese by way of
atonement. Please don’t do this again. My sand-
wich would appreciate your self-governance.

To inhabitants of Main 2nd

Floor, (hank you (or being such an amazing
home this past year for me and my fellow cohorts.
You have hosted countless panicsviolcnt loggia
escapades, and a monagerie of animals that in-
dudes three rats, two bunnies, and occasionally a
CM named Pasha. Your countless services include
the par~ty~vaton which provides a wonderful way
to incorporate people From others ﬂoors into rhc
Wednesday1 night rave zac'mighr be throwing,
access to t e largest loggia on campus, and the
hordes ofmostlyrnaked people scnmpering about
the ﬂoor at any given nighL Plus, the unidenti-
fiable smell that welcomes the brave souls that
come thmugh the door is just another reminder
ofwhat a special place Main 2nd really is. Even
the random assortment ofpéople liv’ g here adds
spice to your almady indomitable spirit.
For those Living on this magniﬁcent ﬂoor
next year, treat her well and make her proud.

Cool balloons, No Limits . I. .

I know you’ve bzen getting a lot of hate lately,
but I wanted to thank you to.- making my day to—
day. I was a little annoyed when I ﬁrst saw all these
signs in rhc Grille; I don't like to so inundarad with
things like that when I’m trying to eat my lunch
and get some work done. And you're using 20 bal-
loans to hold up a single piete ofpnper? Wow, that
seems like a lot of unnecessary waste when you
could just tape it to a wall. But, I chalked it up to
enthusiasm and stopped my complaining untilI
saw what the signs said. 20 balloons to hold up a
shcct of paper to tell inc about Grinnell College’s
bad environmental ractices? ARE YOU FREAK-
ING SERIOUS?! 'Fhanlts for the laughNo Limits ’
, . .you really made my day today.
