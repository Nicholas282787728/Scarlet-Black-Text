Responsibility and the Gﬁnnell Experience

Each of us has evolved as a result of our
Grinnell Experience, and reflecting upon
my iour years at the college in the corn-
{ields. I wonder just what my Grinnell Ex»
perience has been. As a freshman l was
convinced my Grinnell Experience would
hit in my sophomore or junior year and I
would certainly know it when it happened.
Well, it never happened. it evolved right
along with me and it has helped prepare
me for life after Grinnell.

Grinnell has prepared us to meet new exe
periences and challenges by training us to
think, analyze, reason and communicate
ideas. These are not petty skills; they
enable us to adapt to any situation. We
have not been trained for any Vocation and
therein lies the beauty of a liberal arts
degree. The ﬂexibility that is the result of
a liberal education is what makes ﬂ'ie
liberal arts so unique.

We are, in fact, trained to become
graduate students. to apply the general
skills we have learned here at Grinnell to a
speciﬁc area, whether we go on to become
academics or upwardly mobile young proe
fessionals. It is comforting to know our
Grinneil education will serve us well
wherever we go.

We are about to enter a world trought, by
most accounts, with troubles and uncer-
tainties. The world has changed

pace at which the world is changing almost
ensures that today‘s Solutions will be ob
solete tomorrow. New and different pro
blems need to be solved and more and
more pressing concerns are demanding at
tention, Creative approaches and in-
novative thinking will be needed to ad-
dress the issues that face - and will face
m us.

We are among mose who will be ex
pected to provide the initiative to solve the
problems and meet the challenges of
tomorrow. Our liberal arts background
gives us the tools we will need to solve
those problems and meet those challenges.
We are part of a priviledged few who are
able to afford the luxury of a liberal arts
education and as a result, we have the
rﬁponsibility to provide society with the
leadership it needs.

Sooner_than we expect, the torch will be

passed to our generation and the late ol the
Earth will rest, in part, in our hands, The
decisions we make new will dictate the
situations in which we will find ourselves
when our turn comes to bear the torch.
There are no guarantees that we will
always make me correct choices, but the
education we have received at Grinnell
has taught us how to reason through pro-
blems and analyze situations and that is
the best advantage to have when decisions
need to be made.

We are at a Crossroad in history where
traditional approaches to solving society's
problems are clashing with revamped ver-
sions of even older solutions, neither of
which seem to be working. it is up to us, i
believe, to create new and innovative ways
to successfully Solve these and future pron
blems. That would be the culmination of
our Grinnell Experience.

By striking the college bell at today's
ceremonies we pay tribute to Grinnell's
rich history. in the old days the bell rang
out daily to call students to the classroom
It became such a part of Grinnell life that
it inspired many works like the song
printed here.

But in our reminiscences are we looking
tar enough into uie past? History protessoi-
David Jordan thinks not. During his
research he came across a reference to the
original Classic Bell used when Grinnell
was located in Davenport. lowa.

Reputed to be the oldest college bell west
oi the Mississippi, the original bell was
presented to the class oi 1932 by Harry
Downer. Downer graduated irom Gl'innell
in the tragic spring of 1882. Alter spending
some time on display, the Classic Bell was
shul'iled oil to a 3316 shed where Jordan
found it last summer.

Although Jordan suggested the original
hell be displayed at today‘s Commence-
ment, at the time or this writing it was not
known it those ever so busy people over at
Physical Plant could find time to resurrect
the 450-pound relic. So much for paying
tribute to the past
