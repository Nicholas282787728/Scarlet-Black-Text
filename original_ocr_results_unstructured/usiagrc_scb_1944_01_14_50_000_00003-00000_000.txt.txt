Cyclone Slafl'

A campaign to collect pictures of
Grinnell students how on the
campus or in the service will bee
gin in each cottage next week,
Janet Pearce, Cyclone editor, an-
nounced today.

Because of the film shortage,
it has been impossible for the
Cyclone staff photographers to
take the usual number of pie-
tures, Miss Pearce said, and so
students are urged to contribute
any informal snaps they may
have. All prints will be re-
turned as soon as possible
Agents for collecting the snaps
in halls and cottages are as fol—
lows: Macy, Boo Powell, Town
Women, Natalie Kenyon; Mcars,
