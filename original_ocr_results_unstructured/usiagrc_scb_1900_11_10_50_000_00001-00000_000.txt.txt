Our Temporary President.

When Ex-President Gatessig-
niﬁed his intention of severing his
ofﬁcial colmcction with Iowa Col»
lege, the board of trustees began
to look around for a man to act as
temporary President. Aftercarer
ful consideration they chose Plot.
Main to act in that capacity for
a term of one school year. The
choice of the board gave univers-
al satisfaction and when the board
of regents of the State University
of Iowa offered Prof. Main the
chair of the Greek Language in
that institution at a salary far in
excess of the one which he re»
ceiyes here [or services rendered
in a similiar position, most of the
friends of Iowa College took it as
a matter of course that he would
go where he could make the most
money. Not so! Prof. Main,
like Ex-President Gates, is one of
those men whom money cannot
buy. Hcis not conﬁned to the
narrow ﬁeld of pecuniary gain.
His aim in life is a higher one.
In his quiet but impressive way
he urges his fellow men into the
broad ﬁeld of christian activity.
Before his students he holds
up no less high idcal. His re-
fusal of the position at the State
University conﬁrms the fact that
his sympathies and interests are
centeredin a strong desire to help
Iowa College. The students may
well congratulate themselves that
we have among us this man who
is so cheerfully rendering a double

service.

To-day’s Game.

Nebraska isa strong tcam this
year. B. Booth of Princeton has
been coaching the team,Aand ap
parently with tremendous success.
Nebraska has completely shut
out Missouri, Drake and Amos.
Grinnell’s little, light team is per
fectly familiar to all wearers of
Scarlet and Black. Any kind
of a score should not cause sur—
prise. The team lett for Lincoln

IOWA COLLEGE, GRlNNELL,

 

Friday morning via the Rock
Island and arrived there 3:30 in
the afternoon. It will leave Satur-
day afternoon at 5:10 and arrive
in Grinncll 1:50 Sunday morning.
Arrangements have been made
whereby the team will have a
special sleeper coming back,
which will be side tracked here,
giving them a full night's rest.

Our New Goal Posts,

The new goal posts that were
erected by manager Ellis at the
ﬁrst of'tlle football season have
provcd a decided success. These
posts are constructed in the shape
ot an L, The uprights are set
about eight feet behind the goal
line and ten feet above the base,
the L, extends out from the up—
rights even with the goal line.
The chief advantage of these new
posts lies in the fact that they do
away with the danger to which
players were liable under the old
posts: the ball can be pushed
over the goal line without any
danger of the players injuring
themselves against the base of
the goal posts. Manager Ellis
does not claim to be the inventor
of these posts but he does claim
that they made their ﬁrst appear-
ance in the west on a Grinnell
gridiron. It is interesting to note
that A. G. Spaulding & Bros. oi
Chicago have recently received a
patent on these new posts and are
selling them for twenty»ﬁve dol-
lars a set.

Smash! Smash! Smash!

That is what has happened to
the second team schedule. The
ﬁrst team goes along without a
hitch, and even the third team
seems to be in healthy, ﬂourishing
condition as far as games are con-
cerned. But the second team
schedule is having all kinds of
trouble. Everybody knows about
the canceling of the Eldora game
and that needs no further elaborae
tion, beyond mentioning incidents
ally that itEldora plays upper
Iowa, Ellsworth, Western and
Ames, that would seem to put
hel Grinnell’s class, even
though the faculty doesn‘t think
so. That is not all, Ames wishes
to withdraw her agreement in
regard to the second team game
for ﬁnancial reasons and as no

IOWA, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER lo, l900,

formal contract was entered into,
of course there is nothing binding
on either team. Seeing this last
move on the checker board dee
prives the second team schedule
of two thirds of its games, the
schedule can fairly be said to be
in a bad condition, However, the
management hopes to secure a
late November date and will make
all possible efforts to do so.
