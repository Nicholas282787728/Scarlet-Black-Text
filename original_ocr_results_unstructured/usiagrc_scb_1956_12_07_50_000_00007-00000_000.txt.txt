Capifa/ Commentary

By Lynn Parsons
and Toni snornia

Last week's activities in the
scinostcr program were lliglle
lighted by a eonierencc oi par--
ticipating scllools’ advisers label-
ed "The Tenth Anniversary of
the Washington Semestcr A
long array of speakers intro—
duccd an endless parade of cele-

brities and commended the pro
gram ad .noiuseam.

The most noticeable criect
or this alter—dinner oratory
was a rather severe collective
gastric distrirbance on the part
of the audience, and the net
effect oi the interpretation
session held earlier seemed to
be a mutual disagreement in
political theory between ad-
visers and sturlents. All in all
it was a worthwhile getrlo-
gether, however, enlivened liy
brisk exchanges between stu—
deirts and protcssors.

More interesting, though not
directly connected with the pro~
gram, was the participation,
again, of one or" , to reporters
in the televised College Press
Conference” at which India’s
Roung Ambassador, Mr. v. K.
Krishna lvlennon, was the guest.
During the tormal interview,
the brilliant but irascible Mr.
Krishna Mcnnon kept his tom»
per fairly well, only once de-
nouncing the moderator for air
swering incorrectly a question
addressed to him.

It was apparent throughout,
however, that the line oi quc5r
tioning did not particularly
please the ambassador and aftr
erward he was quick to explain
why. He felt, and apparently
with some justification, that the
questions asked wcrc intended
not to explore his mind as he
would have wished. but on the
contrary, sought to satisfy pre—
conceived convictions for the so
called student reporters,

In an informal gnﬂiering at
the apartment of the Shaw’s
spansor, the conversation bcr

came even more lively, with
the ambassador at one point
going so iar as to tell one oi
the other panel members eith—
er to think and ask questions
more objectively, or to “shut
“pp,

The lnakcrup oi this gathering
seemed to prejudice its tone.
Put together an Indian ambaSr
sador, an Egyptian press zit»
tache, and a female Bri sh Curr
respondent, and, considcring the
present world relations of thc
represented powers, you can
imagine the outcome. The major
complaint regarding misunder—
standing in the United States of
the world situation generally
and lndia’s i-olc particularly was
unfair news Coverage and biased
treatment or that initially slant»
cd coverage.

, Without going into too much
detail here, the case made out.
considering especially the ile
lnstrations presented, goes a
long way toward oiio's views
ing the domestic press in n
somcrrhat diifereut light than
that in which it presents it»
sell. Once the Indian position
is claritied with surprisingly
available iacts, it too. appear-s
iii a greatly diiiereirt light
than one customarily believes.

A word about Mr. Krishna
Mcnnon hinisclt is in order. A
man dccply dovotcd to a cause,
it at times appears that he may
indeed be overly taken with it,
particularly in his impatience
with what he would call “ms
bred misunderstandings.” Some
of this may indeed be juslilir
able it his other claims can be
taken as legitimate on their
face, but one gets the iocling
that any extended monomania
can be highly- deleterious to
both the stability and persuar
sive value oi highly placed per-
sons.

Council Corner

Central committee.

7. The Student Council Com—
mcnds the feeling on the part of
Lcaguc Board and C of HP that
they wish to protect the inter.
ests oi the women and men. The
council wishes to go a stcp tar—
ther and protect the interests ot'
the students regardless of sex.

3. I believe that the cams
inuiiications between student
governmental agencies could
be improved. I leel the Stu-
rlent Council has shown its
willingness to communicate by
sending weekly minutes and
copies or its constitution to
each member oi the C oi HP
and League Board.

9. The liasou official would
insurc that a spirit of Cowper-
ation would continue in the in-
turc Reliance on the League
Board and c of HP Presidents
would not guarantee that this
spirit would not die out, hows
ever strong it may be this year.

10. i personally hope that
this proposal can be uscrl to
strengthen student government
as n whoir. and stimulate sln»
dcnt interest in campus gav~
crnmcnt.

Any other issues which may
arise irom this discussion are
worthwhile but not the issue
about which I am concerned.
I may have personal opinions
on these issues as a student but
as student Council president, I
am intcrcsted solely in improv—
ing communications. 1 am will-
ing to discuss this proposal in a
mass meeting or at a cottee
hour or individually. if you
have doubts you'd like cleared
up, please tell your ball repre-
sentative or We're always
