Trustees scheduled to
visit Grinnell in May

BY MARISSA THOMPSON
StaffWriter

In a session that will emphasize
academic planning, Grinncll's Board
ofTrustecs will visit the campus for
the third time this aeadernicyeat on
May 5 and 7.

“The [Board] will discuss the

, educational goals of the

college. ..thar is, whatwe do and why

were different," said special Assistant
to the President Jonathan Brand.

Associate Dean Paula Smith.
specified, “We are waiting for some
comparative data to be analyzed, but
basically the Dean's office will present
anoverview ofthcacademieprogram
to the board ofTrustees."

Although plans are still in
progress, Smith said that the two
main focus points ofthe visit will be
the “special qualities revealed in the
North Central Association review for
re.accreditation ofthe college,” and
“new elements ofthe academic prov
gram and questions for the future.“

In Grinncll’s selfstudy for rc-ac<
erediration. the distinctive aspects of
Grinncll were found to be the “in-
tensive student»faculty interactions.
student selfgovernance in designing
their own course of study, and a
physical environment conducive to
learning," smith said.

“Grinncll’s academic program is
becoming more widely known na-
tionally," she continued. This has re.
sulted in Grinncll eliciting invita»
tions to apply for national grants and

interest from “some ofour most highly
respected peer schools [to use] our pro-
grams and facilities as models that they
could adopt for their own campuses.”

According to Smith, issues
Grinnell's will deal with in the future
include “efforts to enrich the upper
level of the curriculum (through the
experimentwithavoluntaryeapstone
experience), the enhancement oftech-
nology on campus to enrich learning,
and new efforts to coordinate and
strengthen our international programs
as well as Gtinncll’s historical focus on
social Commitment."

Faculty Chair Elizabeth Dobbs,
and SGA President Fetar l<laersch '99.
will also give reports before the entire
Board. While on campus, while
smaller committees, such as the stu-
dent affairs committee and the area
demie affairs committee, will meet
separately. Additionally, the Trustees
will be introduced to next year's SGA
President, Vivek venugopal '01, and
Vice President John Aerni '01.

The student affairs program and
other big issues at the college, like the
technology concerns, are also agenda
items for the update of the trustees,
President Osgood mentioned.
Osgood, commenting that it's rarely
up to me president to make a presen.
tarion to the board, said that he at-
tends and reacts to issues that come
up in die meetings.

Brand added that the trustees will
also discuss the By-Laws, as they have
done at the last two meetings. Osgood
specified that they will be discussing

CBS hosts conference

Grinnell and attend the Afticana
studies Conference. on Friday, ac»
tivities include movies, a dinner to
officially inrroduee students to me
conference, and an evening parry.
Saturday will be the busiest day of
the conference. The focus ofthe day
will be on the 10 workshops orga-
nizcd by CBS for me attendees. The
workshops will be divided into two
blocks of five workshops each, one
in the morning and one in the at.
ternoon. The workshops will cover
a wide range of black issues, from
“African Americans in Government”
to ”The Role ofthe Students in the
Religious Communiry." Presenters
include professors, alumni, students,

I and guest speakers. After the after-
noon workshops, there will be a
movie, followed by dinnerwirh key»
note speech by M. Douglas Scott
from Washington, D.C. After Din-
ner, attendees will enjoy a concert
by musician Galen AbdunRazzao
from Florida, followed by a Harris
party. On Sunday, the conference
will draw to a close with Black
Church at Grinnell, held in Herrick
Chapel, All events, except those in
which students have paid for food,
will be open to the public, who are
encouraged to come.

Of the 10 workshops, five will
he presented by current Grinnell
students. one student presenter is
Moses Mason '99, who will host a
workshop entitled “Black Folks and
the Christian God We Serve.” Said
Mason about his topic, "The idea
for the workshop is form.research
I'm doing this semester for my rcli-
gious studies seminar. I’m looking
at the black church and how it's been
used by African Americans to sus-
tain themselves in this nation.”
Mason will examine such topics as
how the black church has been used
to define God, as well as activities
which take place in black churches.

Arin Hill ’02 is another student
presenter, She, along with Joseph
Nelson ’02 and Toya Terry ’02, will
present a workshop entitled “Black
Sexuality: Constructions, Myths,
and the Search for Truth." Accord-
ing to Hill, being a presenter on
black sexuality is a new experience
for her, but one which she is excited
about. In fact, she was the one who
suggested the topic. “Sex is some.
thing everyone thinks about,“ said
Hill. “We're going to be talking
about sexuality in general, but fo.
cusing on black sexuality." Hill,
Nelson, and Terry will discuss such
topics as young adult blacks and sex.
as well as various health issues. Hill
would like to see as many
Crinnellians as possible at the con-
ference. “I hope people come to the

conference, even if they’re nervous
about it."

Hill’s sentiments were echoed by
Willis. “1 think people have this no-
tion that black organizations are ex»
clusively for black students." said
Willis. “This is ridiculous." Willis
emphasized the fact that all students
arewelcome to all CBS hinctions, and
not just this conference.

Grinnell’s first black student con—
ference in decades has been a long time
in the making. CBS ﬁrst began the
organization process over last summer.
“A lot of people want this conference
to happen." Said Willis. He notes that
CBS has talked to the mayor of
Grinncll as well as President Osgood
about a possible conference, and both
responded positively to the idea. CBS
annually attends the Big XlI confer-
ence for black student organizations.
After the most recent one in Boulder,
Colorado, the club decided it would
be beneﬁcial to hold a similar confer-
ence speciﬁcally aimed at smaller col-
leges. Eric Otoo ’01 became the chair-
person of the conference committee to
organize the event.

Initially, CBS had planned just to
invite the 14 other schools widiin the
Associated Colleges of the Midwest
(ACM). The soon realized, however,
that only inviting ACM schools would
not be enough. Thus, CBS decided to
extend invitations to 52 schools. Of
course, notcsWillis, not all 52 schools
will come, for a variety of reasons.
“One reason," said Willis, “is that not
all 52 have black organizations, or ac-
tive ones.” Other schools simply might
not have enough money to make the
trip. Whereas SGA allocates funds to
clubs at Grinnell, some college orga»
nizations must rely on fundraising. Be»
cause this conference is near the end
of the school year, some clubs may
have already exhausted their money for
the year. still, CBS expects a healthy
turnout for the conference.

In the long run, CBS hopes that
events such as this conference will in-
crease black presence at Gtinncll.
Willis notes that there are currently
only 51 black students at Crinnell,
which includes foreign students. In
I990, therems 100. By incrcasing the
visibility ofblack students, CBS hopes
to encourage more prospective black
stud :nts to come to Gtinncll (and
stay).

their own terms ofoffrce, and whether
or not there should be a limit on terms,
which he said is a common issue on
boards.

Based on observations he has made
over the year, Osgood said “The trust.
ces believed that they were not inter—
acting with the college community
enough, with either the students or the
faculty," An agenda for the trustees visit
will come our about a week before the
trustees arrive, and following their de-
parrure a summary ofthe visit will be
distributed through me campus mail.
“This is because students don't know
what trustees do [otherwise]," said
Osgood.

In fact, the interaction between stu.
dents and the trustees has been more
successful than between the faculty and
trustees, Osgood noted.

“There needs to be more everyday
interactions between people,” he com—
mented, “while we also need students
and faculty to talk about issues ofsub-
stance with the trustees," osgood said
that the goal is to avoid “crisis meet-
ings" and their opposite, meetings with—
out enough substance, between trust-
ees, faculty and students.

The Trustees will have dinner with
faculty members on May em and will
join the students for lunch in Quad on
May 7th to encourage “regular inter—
actions" between all. Similar dinner
and lunch arrangements occurred for
the trustees last v- t in February

A donor has endowed two intern-
ships for students to enable them to
workwith Wall Avmd recipients. This
internship opportunity is meant to
beneﬁt the campus in two ways. First
of all, it will allow die Wall Award tee
cipient (who received the Wall Award
to allow them to pursue service projects
after graduation) (0 have an assistant

internship will also put a current Grin-
ncll student in contact with a Grinnell
grad who is actively pursuing service
projecn. The internship would help
Wall award winners widi mcir projects
while connecting students interested in
social action to graduates pursuing such
work.

The reconstituted Eco-Campus
Committee will be renamed the Cam»
pus Advisory Committee on Environ-
mental Concerns. After examining the
ECC, Osgood felt it deserved institu-
tional backing. Osgood has agreed to
fund some level of expansion of Reed
style recycling through the Fund for
Excellence.

This new trend towards social ac-
tion is not limited to the college com.
munity. Since April fifth, several dis-
abled employees have been hired to
work in Dining Services under Iowa’s
Supported Employment program.
Because Grinncll College is one of the
towns biggest employers, Osgood felt
that it was “irresponsible that we are
not participating."

The college has also begun a pro-
gram to match employee contribuuons
of time and money to local charities.

Osgood claims that he did not con-
sider advancing the college’s reputation
in considering these ideas. “I can’t say
I thought ofit in this regard” he said
explaining that he was working to up-
hold the sdiool’s identity which is de-
tivcd in part from an ethic of service.

Political pies of the BBB

pie continued from p 1

Grinnellians reactions are split.

“I think what happened was pretty
stupid all the way though." said one
sophomore who wished not to be
identiﬁed. “Throwing a pic was stu-
pid, bur attacking someone because
they threw a pie? Thars unjustiﬁed,”

President Osgood released a state-
mcnt condemning the pie-ing, but also
said in an interview that he would “op.
pose any kind ofassault, physical vio-
lcncc or prank that involved hitting
or touching at Grinnell.“

“1 think its particularly dangerous
when hitting or assault is conjoined
in an effort to constrain or stop
speech," said Osgood. “It will not be
tolerated.”

“It disgraces Gtinnell,” said Sym»
posium co-cootdinator Professor
David Campbell. “A physical attack
on someone for no other reason bases
then their beliefs done by people weat-
ing masks, who did not allow
discourse. , .[it was] a cowardly act.”

Campbell didn't disagree with criti-
cism that the symposium was one
sided in its presentation ofcorporate
involvement in agriculture. “I think
[the symposium] addressed issues of
the [positive] possibilities ofbioengie
necring well. I don't drink it addressed

ing into the wild and I don’t know if
that potential could be fully addressed.
There is neither much research on the
issue, norwetc peoplewho couldspeak
to that issue in attendance...even if
there had been some experts {on nega»
rive side effects of bioengineeringi at
the symposium, there would not be a
lot they could say because there have
not been many studies {on most negae
rive side effectsl"

“This is thought policing," said
Campbell of the pie— g. “I disagree
wirh Dennis Avery's views on many
things. Some things he says, I disagree
with vehemently. Bur he has the right
to express his views on this campus.. .I
disagree with this Biorie Brigade” con.
tinued Campbell. “I think they are

. scltdesrnictive. They give their oppo-

nents exactly what they want. All they
have accomplished is adding another
ten thousand dollars [in speaking fees]
to Dennis Avery’s pocket."

The issues complications have
made it a hard one for many in stu-
dent Affairs to deal with.

“It’s an unfortunate incident that
occurred,“ said Dean ofstudenrs Tom
Crady, “It is something we wish hadn't
occurred."

“This is not something [Grinncll
College] has handled well,“ said an-

other member of the adminisuation
who wished to remain anonymous.

“[Mariannc Maeckclbergh] is the
one who goes to school here, she‘s the
one who pays, she’s the one the secu-
rity office is paid to protect," said Beth
Resnick '00 HShe’s the one who was
at the hospital. [Grinncll College’s]
treatment of the situation has becn
awful."

“The situation is still under inves-
tigation," said Briscoe, “and there are
many supplemental incidents [that
have taken place.]” In response to
concerns about this week’s campus se-
curiry report, which didn’t not include
an entry for Maeckelbergh’s trip to the
medical center, Briscoe'said “that
event and others are all included in
the entry because they are part of the
same report...A line in the campus
security report might read “larceny"
but there may be four or live incidents
that are all part of that report." Of
his dealings with Macckclbcrgh,
Briscoc said “She seems like avery nice
person and I hope her ankle gets
better. ..its unfortunate that this hap-
pened." The security report on the
incident will be turned over to Tom
Crady on its completion who will ul-
timately decide what to do about the
incident.

Aﬁer the Biotic Baking Brigade threw a pie into the ﬁzce ofspen/cer
Dennis Avery, the organization issued the following statement:

Grinnell, Iowa—The Biotie Baking Brigade (BBB) de-
livered yet another pie to a deserving recipient today, this
time to free marker biotechnology advocate Dennis Avery
at the “Biotechnology and Agriculture" conference ofthe
campus ofGrinnell College.

The Central Iowa Anarchist (CIA) cell ofthe BBB con»
ducted “Operation: Averys Savory" to target me manth
serves as Director of the center for Global Food Issues at
the Hudson Institute, as a response to his shameless and
flagrant support of biotechnology and industrial factory
farming.

The pastry incident occurred around noon at the
Herrick Chapel during the conference’s convocation. As
Avery delivered a keynote speech, BBB/CIA Agent Carob
suddenly appeared and replaced the bald spot on Avery's
head with a delightful vegan and mostly organic (it is Iowa,
after ail—no Mecca for health food, indeed) carob/aimond/
apple sauce pie. Agent Carob then escaped on foot and
disappeared, as they say, without a trace. '

“Dennis Avery is especially known for his industry-bi-
ased neolihcrai analyses of trends in food demand, produc-
tivity, and global farm competition; in other words, he’s a
shill for industrial factory farming and the so.eailcd “Green

' Revolution.’ Likewise, the Center for Global Food Issues is

a from group for ‘Big Agriculture: which increasingly is
focused on using biotechnology to create a Next Green
Revolution: Ifwe don't stop these mad Frankensteins from
polluting our food chain now, we will have a nightmarish
agricultural monster to deal with later. And as the BBB
always says, a pie in time saves nine," declared Agent Carob.

Avery served nearly a decade as a senior agriculture ana.
lyst for the US. Department ofstare, and has conducted
policy analysis for the us. Department ongrlculture. He
authored “Saving the Planet with pesticides and plastics,“
and also wrote “How-Poverty Won't save the Planet"— a
response paper to John Robbins “Diet for a New America. "
Avery wrote in American outlook magazine (a quarterly
publication of the Hudson Institute) that “consumers of
organic and “natural foods are eight times as likely to he
attacked by a new strain ofE. coli bacteria,” a claim which

has been completely debunked. He also claimed that, “We've ,

never found a single consumer death from pesticide resi»
dues. and only a few dozen cases ofconsumcr illness."
The Hudson Institutes Center for Global Food Issues
serves a key role for agriculture that “Wise Use' movement
groups do for mining and logging: the propagation ofmis-
information and lies under the banner of science. Avery
argues that “there is no evidence ofa growing ozone hole,
over the Arctic or anywhere else,“ that there is no global
warming, and logging is good because, “ifa rrce isn't out. it

will die and rot" (quotes taken from “How Poverty Won’t
Save the World"). The title of an Avery article posted on
the Center's website says it all: “Big Hog Farms are Good
for the Environment.“ Appropriately enough, noted agri—
cultural scholar, activist, and former Vice president Dan
Quayle serves on the Board of Directors at the Hudson
Institute. Check our http://www.cgfi.com/

This latest incident follows three previous successful pie
operations in California, in which the CEOs of the two
largest global biotech corporations (Robert Shapiro of ,
Monsanto and Douglas Watson ofNovattis) and two uni-
versity chancellors (Robert Berdahl and Larry Vanderhoef
ofthe University ofcalifornia at bctkeley and Davis, re—
spectively), were also given their just desserts for recklessly
pushing the genetic engineering agenda. On February 5th.
the group Welsh Action Against Genetics (WAAG) ar—
tempted to pie the United Kingdom’s science Minister,
Lord David sainsbury, while he was on a tour of
swanseauniversiry. Regrcttably, a WAAG operative failed
in her/his organic cream pie delivery, drough tord Sainshury
was forced to scuttle around the university and hide sheep.
ishly in doorways as other activists attempted follow up
actions. The minister was last seen been bundled into a car
and being sped away from his group of“admiters.”

“operation: Avery’s Savory" is dedicated to our fellow
BBB agent—comrades who bravely face down the criminal
“iustice' system, and who will change the world or pic try-
ing. This pie-by splooshing goes out to the Cherry Pic 3.
sentenced to 6 months for the Mayor Brown pie incident,
as well as to Agents peeun (Bob Grecnberg) ofthe BBL
Midwest Faction in Minnesota and Creamy‘cencs (Dave
Pike) ofthe BBB-Nor’eastah lrrcgulars in New Hampshire,
Both agents are facing serious charges as a result ofdeliver.
ing just desserts to a pie-falutin' state senator and a genet—
ics/animal cloner, respectively.

San Francisco Judge Ernest Goldsmith thought his dta.
conian sentence for the Cherry Pie 3 would deter any fur—
ther pielitical pressure, and Lt. Col. Steve Mcngclkorh of
the Minnesota state Patrol recently asserted that “we will
deal aggressively" with Agent Penn. But in point offact,
the opposite reaction to what the forces oflaw and order
want has occurred, and political rc—pie—sals have increased
dramatically throughout the industrial world. As Max
stirner wrote many decades ago, “The great appear great
only because we are on out knees. Let us now pie."
