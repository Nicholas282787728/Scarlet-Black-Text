Lectures examine various feminist issues

By Ju ie Kaster

The Grinnell Feminist Movee
ment has received it boost from the
Mortarboard Lecture Series “Di~
rections in Feminism: Exploring
Gender, Sex, and Politics.” The
purpose of the series, which runs
through March i4th, is to bring to
Grinncll speakers who represent
diverse perspectives in order to
demonstrate the breadth of {{3le
nistvaluesacrossdii'ferentcultures.

“The weaving together of sub-
jects such as racism, religion, and
gender with different abstract and
concrete approaches to feminism
will hopefully make Grinnellians
discuss, argue, and respect the
various directions which individu-
als are taking within the Feminist
Movement.” said senior Erik
Skinner, whoisorganizingtheevent
with senior lulie Goings.

The five selected speakers for
the series include Molly Yard.
President of N ational Organimlion
for Women (N.O.W.), Harry Brod,
Professor of Gender Studies,
Kenyon College, Michael
Biembaum,edltorofChangingMen
Magazine, Bylle Avery, Director
of the National Black Women’s
HealthProject,andrapeprevent.ion
educator Joseph Weinberg.

Yard, whose February 28th
speech began the series, said in a
later interview that she was sur-
prised by the stigma surrounding
theword‘Teminist“giventhestrong
supportforthewomen'smovement.

Yard answered the question of
male victimization and the role of
men within the NOW organiution
by saying that the main business of
NOW is to deal primarily with the
position of women in mainstream
society. Men are encouraged to
join NOW, she added.

NOW has been accused ofbeing
a white, predominantly middle-
class organization. Yard explained
that since its beginning 25 years
ago. the organization has often not
had ample time for drawing in
groupsofslightly differentstanoes,

“During times of crisis situa
tions, such as the beginning of the
Reproductive Rights Movement,
NOW neglected to pull in certain
groups because the senseof urgency
led us to call those organizations
which hold the same positions as
we do," said Yard.

Yard added that women of color
often are very involved in local
groups and often have no time fora
national organization. She ex
pressed her desire to strengthen
alliances with those groups. In
addition. NOW is working closely
with mewomen’spcaccmovement.

“Working in conjunction with
the Women’s Inlemational League
for Peace and Freedom is exciting
because We are finally able to stand
back and consider all of the groups
who should be involved and since
we are not working under crisis
conditions we can put our effort
into networking and working with
a variety of groups," Yard slated,

Weinberg,whoholdsworkshops

all over the nation for high school
and collegesportsteams,Women's
Studiesclasses, and prisons, is con-
ducting workshops for men and
women on the subject of rape, He
said that men have a responsibility
to educate each other on the issue.

“I must talk to my brothers be
cause some women won’t talk to
men about rape and violence and
some men won‘t listen to those
women who do speak to them. Sex-
ism allows me the opportunity to be
heard and I seize that opportunity
because violence is continuing
unabated and something must
change,“ said Weinberg. ”Femi-
nism is a radical vision or revision
of the World and the work I do,
primarily talking to my brothers
about the violence being done to
men, women, and children by them

 

 

 

 

or in their name, is taking us that
much closer to realizing this Vl-
sion," he added.

Weinberg saw the choice of
speakers for the lecture series as an
expansion of the definition of
“fcminist"und feltthai“thevarious
perspectives widened and
strengthened Ilieideaoffeminisin."
He added that education was es
sential to societal change.

Prior to the lecture series, Skillr
ner was unsure how the three male
speakers would be received. “We
felt it was essential to the lecture
series toshow Ihzllfeminism effects
us all," he said.

Students of both sexes packed
into South Lounge for Weinberg‘s
talk on rape. Junior Rachel
Landsberg said, “It was great to
havea male speaker because I think
