Meeting Before iNew Members
Take Their Seats.

On Thursday afternoon, March 23,
the College Council held iE last meet-
ing before the outgoing of half of its
senior members, and transacted an
. unusual amount of important business.
A decided revision ot the system of
regulating outside activities was adopt.
ed, the muchvrliscussed innovation of
“Senior privileges" was aPDl‘OVEd, the
revised rules for the class scrap were
adopted and an honor system l'esolur
lion pill. through.

The honor system, as passed by the

Council, is much sin'uller than that

Iound in most colleges where this plan
is followed, inasmuch as no provision

for imposing penalties by a strident
court is made; it merely adds to the
present 5; stern of conducting examina
tions a new sate-guard against dis-
honesty. The resolution as passed lol-
low

“Resolved: That in all future ewanr.
inations in Grinnell College, the stu~
dent must, in order to make his work
valid, sign the following statement: “I
pledge my honor that l have neither
given nor received aid in this eynmiua
lien (or exercise)." This system to be
put in operation as soon as ratiﬁed by
the faculty and by a three-fourths vote
of the student bod'"

This résolulion will go hetoro the

Revise Activities System.

Besides putting a iew rrrore minor
M‘u‘lillés into the list, the Council abol-
ished the rtgular allowance of 30 hours
total lor studies and activities and
made a provision that no student can
exceed the 24 hour limit without oh.
ta ing the Dean,
This makes such cases a matter [or

The vote in favor at senior privileges
was w ithowt any negatives and was in»
ken practically without debate.

Add :0 Scrap Rules.

The revised rules for the class scrap
keep the iormcr rules and provide, in
addition, that the scrap must be held
on a speciﬁed section or the campus
and that in case every sophomore is

SCHOLARLY LECTURE GIVEN

Small But Appreciative Audience
Hears Talk on Great Novelist#
Professor Scheve Plans While
Audience Waits for Speaker.

Professor Richard T. Burton, of the
University at Minnesota, delivered a
scholarly lecture on Dickens and his
works in Herrick Chapel last evening,
and was well received by a small and
responsive audience.

The innate love 01 Dickens for all
that pertains to human lile was
strongly emphasized as one of his
claims to immortality, as it is through
this appreciation that he. blending the
tears and smiles of humanity. is en-
allied to bring reader and character in
touch, The very essence of his in
llueiice lies in his brotherhood, and
deep, human sympathy. Contrary to
all accepted ethics of literature, Dick-
ens checks the action at times and
lrararrgues his readers.

The educational value of his works

, s dwelt upon. the reason for their
eflicrenry in this direction being as.
ci-ibed to the fact that the author saw-
lite through the eyes or a cllildi
simply. As a matter of mere i-eiorma»

lion, they did much toward revolution
izing English school life.

Dickens is essentially a pprtrayer
oi character, which at times may even
lapse into caricature, though retaining
the fundamental truths ol nature
which are so necessary to li-iir lrtera-
'tiiic.Ev'en the grosest caricatures are

temper-ed by a broad. humanitarian tlee
