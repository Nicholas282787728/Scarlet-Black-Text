Brass and chai:

Jazz Night returns to Bob’s and
studious patrons can't help but
watch and tap their toes

Ill/JULlA BOTTLES

The barely audible whir of the espresso machine hurns in
weak protest to thc blar'c ofa trumpet/i play on a familia une
drifts from a keyboard and a ﬁddle follows deftly mimicking
and embellishing the same phrase. But in this jazz club there
are no seen-everything waitresses and foggy smoke doesn’t
cloud the air. Instead, students hide away in booths with their
noses hur-icd deeply in books and sip on cups otehai and black
coffcc. .

Jazz Night is in its second year at Bob’s Underground. A
low key affair where members from across the Grinncll come
munity play for a littlc or as longas theylikc, it is awcckiy event
that attracts a dedicated following, Students can sit back and
listen to live jania genre of music sometimes difﬁcult to ﬁnd
around Grinnelliand student musicians can ﬂex their impror
visational muscles and play in a relaxed atmosphere. Randy
Brush, who plays atJazz Night, compares it to “being in New
York without all the traveling”

The night began with only a drummer, bass guitarist and
keyboardist. A smattering of students sat in from of tables
piled with books and covered with loose sheets ofphotocopiod

- articles streaked with highlighter marks. Not many looked up
as the combo began to play, clapping respectfully but abscntly
when the ﬁrst song was ﬁnished.

Ten minutes latcr‘,Bob’s transformed into an entirely differ-
ent scene. Students crammed into every table, booth and couch;

a tow even camped out on the
ﬂoorwheuseating became truly
scarce. Although some still do
voted attention to homework,
many contented themselves
watching and listening.

The number of players grew early on in the night as well.
The brass scction ﬁlled out and soon spilled out over the stage,
crowding the front of the coffeehouse. The informal atmoV
sphere meant that students wandered in and out ofBob's, most
with their instruments slung on their backs, Each had their
chance to solo, showing off their own take on the song being
playedA teasing camaraderie already seems to be forming be
tween the musicians.

Devotees from last year know that anything can happen at
Jazz Night.This Monday, audience members were treated to an
impressive duct on keyboard as well as an improvisational ren-
dition of"l Like to Move It,”originally made famous by Reel 2

Chapter III

Clyde had met Beth for the ﬁrst Lime
about 10 years ago when he still worked for
the electric Company climbing power poles
and when he had hobbies other than wannr
in'g his stool in Badger's Burr On this partieur
lar fall Thursday in late September he had
decided to go fishing. So, grabbing his rod
and tackle box he climbed into the cab ofhis
battered brown Ford F-150 and headed down
towards the nearby reservoir,

The trees on cither side or the highway -

were already well on their way down the slip
pery slope of fall with its inevitable end in
winterr Clyde pulled into the gravel driveway
of Bernie’s Bait Shop but left his truck run-
ning to keep the crib warm while he went in
to buy a six—pack, some worms and pack of
Marlbotos.

Clyde had been living in Silver Cliff for
15 years and in that time much had changed
about the town: higher powers built a Mo
Donalds, someone burned down the post ofr

ﬂcc and it had to be rebuilt and the city coun»
cil made Old Man Marvin stop moving his
cattle down Main Street,

However, Bernie of Bernie's Bait Shop
hadn't changed. He was not one of those
people who looked forever blonde, forever
young and forever suong; it seemed that Ber-
nit: had always been 95 and would always be
95. Clyde found it impossible to imagine him
without a stoop, without his prune of face,
and minus his raspy emphysemic cough,

The door jangled shut behind Clyde. Berv
n‘rc was behind the counter, as always, enjoy
ing a cold cup oreoircc and a smoldering cig-
arette. Clyde nodded brieﬂy in his direction
and then went back to the beer cooler along
the far will and opened the glass door.

He was in the process orreaching in for a
six-pack of Busch, which in his opinion was
thc perfect and only beer for ﬁshing, when
a young woman slammed her way into the

whatever provocatively named sorree will be at
that location on Sept.29 and forget aboutThe
Blow in Gardner Lounge.

But indie fans and their kind will be treated
with one of the most promising young artists
in the scene. Khaela Maticich (the artist known
as The Blow) has a kind of easy warmth and
intelligence
that some of
her compa-
triors on the
enigmatic K
Records label
lack, and her
lyrical content and folkrimbued electronrca
can easily win over the most jaded ﬂarinelr
wearing foot—tappcr.

on “Paretrtlrescs,” her most popular song
offof2006's Paper-Television, she sings of con—
ilicred lovers tentatively taking shelter in each
other's arms, like a pair orthe aforementioned
grammatical marks, Based solely on that
song, Maticich would merely ﬁt the mold of
a thousand other playfully cute indie singer-
songwriters. But on other songs she explores
conceptions oftht feminine idcal and analyzes
her own imaginative concepts ofthc ideal in a
completely new way.

In “Come On Petunia," she imagines a let

ponders why someone she met at a party didn't
want to call back, since “it's not a lot I want/
just some talking."

The music’s not as highbrow us all that,
and the overall entertainment value from The
Blow can easily be round in watching Maricich

that surpasses
most artists with full bands (not just drum

Simply, Maritich is an artist firsr, musi-

beats augmenting a narrative about city life,
relationships and life as an independentwomr

message, but to discount it would lrrmp her in
with the many other bands that lack it.

She will be appearing with High Places,
