Naisbitt Report Released:

Locally Commissioned Study Spawns Criticisms

by John Harrison

Just recently, the long awaited Naisbitt
Group report commissioned by the Grin-
nell 2000 Foundation was released and in it
are numerous suggestions to improve
agrliculture, business, and culture in Grin-
nel .

In a forward to the report. John Naisbitt,
bestselling author of the book,
Megatrends. describes Grinnell as a com-
munity “with much‘to recommend it and

much to build on,H Yet Naisbitt warns that
with “hard times for farmers, fear of loss
lng young people to job opportunities
elsewhere, a deteriorating downtown, and
with frustration over the lack of leadership
and direction for revitalization," Grinnell
has a limited amount of time to respond to
the challenge facing the community. Yet,

although many have anticipated the
report, some Grinnell College professors

have been critical of the Naisbitt Group’s
research techniques.

The study was commissioned late last
summer by the Grinne112000 Foundation, a
grassroots planning and development
organization with over a thousand
members who live and work in Grinnell.
According to the Foundation, the Naisbitt
Group was hired “to help the community
take stock of where it is today and where it
might go over the next fifteen years.” The
report contains the results of surveys and
interviews conducted last fall, '

Among the report findings, there con-
tained thirty action steps that the Naisbitt
Group suggests should form a “Grinnell
plan” where revenues from public and
private sources can all be combined to pro-
vide seed capital for community
revitalization efforts.

Among the suggestions pertaining to
Grinnell College, the Naisbitt group
recommended that the 2000 Foundation
and Grinnell College develop a “speakers
forum" focusing on other communities
successes in responding to agricultural
issues, On business related issues, the
report suggested that local retailers
establish a student advisory board in order
to better address college students‘ can-
sumer needs, Furthermore, the Naisbitt
Group suggested that Grinnell College
should “consider special funding
strategies such as no-interest or low
interest loans or grants to retailers who
have demonstrated the potential for suc-
cess." The report also criticized Grinnell
for inadequate child day care, limited ac~

Freshman Becomes Father

by Howard Lange

A week before break, Steve Fors ac-
complished something which very few col-
lege freshmen have done 7 he became a
father.

At 9:15 on March 7, Amy Fors, wile of
Steve Fors, gave birth to Brian Michael.
Brian weighed in at 7 lbs., 3 oz., and
measured 20% in. long. Brian joins the
elite ranks of Grinnell student children,

The delivery went without complication,
but Brian was born with jaundice, a minor
problem involving the liver which effects
two out of three newborns. His father
reports that Brian is now fine, though, and
has gained over three pounds since the
birth.

Life has become more complicated [or
Fors now that he must balance academia
and parenthood. 3:00 am. diaper changes
and 8:00 classes do not mix well. Worst of
all is the added responsibility and worry of
supporting and properly raising a child.

“You have so much to worry about,”
says Fors, “(such as) if he‘s alright, if you
know how to handle him. And then there is
the long~term, too m how are you going to
raise him?"

But the added troubles carry a big
payoii, “When you have a son it's great.”
continues Fors. “I can't even express it,
it's so great.” So between the joys and wore
ries Fors concludes, “I’m really happy,

yet kind of cautious and kind of leery oi
gaming home'and our being alone with
im.

Fortunately, Fors‘ professors have been
Very understanding of his situation, which
relieves some of his academic tension.
Both of the Fors’ parents have strongly
supported them emotionally and financial»
ly, and the two of them also enjoy wide
support and help from their peers at Grinr
ne .

The couple is not unfamiliar with finan-
cial diilioulty, and from past experience
Fors remains faithful that all will still go
well now that Brian is born. “It will be
rough,” says Fors, “but I know we'll make
it. For one thing because God's watching
over us. He’s been watching over us so far,
and we’ve had enough, and I'm sure we’ll
have enough.”

There are some advantages to starting
life as the son of a Grinnell College stu~
dent. The Fors have already taken Brian
to his first band concert, and they plan to
take him to some concerts here at college,
including the Mirecourt 'rrio,

Fors commented on some highlights in
Brian’s future. “He's going to be a running
back or a Wide receiver just like his dad,
and he's going to be a sprinter. i can tell 7
he's already pidgeon toed, so that’s just
like his dad, too.”

Sionals, and the lack of a first-rate
restaurant.

Concerning business improvements, the

Naisbitt Group recommends that Grinnell
attract a produce packaging iacility along
with targeting catalog companies and
firms with agricultural biotechnology ap-
plications.
, When asked about the findings of the
Naisbitt Group, Ralph Luebben, Professor
of Anthropology. said, “their research
methods were a little on the light side,”
Luebben pointed to a number of poorly
structured questions which asked people it
they thought Grinnell would need a public
transportation system in the year 2000.
Luebhen said, “It is very hard to get peer
pie to conceptualize Grinnell in the year
2000.” Professor of Sociology Kent Mc-
Clelland also criticized the report for not
getting a random sample. McClelland said
that because the survey was done through
the mail the sample acquired was biased
toward those individuals who return mail
surveys. And, in fact, of the ten thousand
surveys the Naisbitt group sent out, only
eleven percent were returned.

Moreover, Luebben found fault with
some oi the report's suggestions which
called for the attraction of mail-order
houses which Luebben pointed out were
failing due to an over-saturated market.
Luebben said, “people looking tor some
kind of action need to think small.” Luebr
ben suggests one good start toward
revitalization might be to ask all the
shopkeepers when they last washed their

windows."

As lor the suggestions made concerning
Grinnell College. Alan Jones, professor of
History, said, “I don’t know if I agreed
with all of the recommendations of the
report." in particular, Jones said he did
not agree with the idea of the college enter~
ing the loan business. On this same point
Luebben said “the college is a non-prolit
institution which has to preserve its tax-
exempt status.

Perhaps the strongest criticism in
response to the Naisbitt report was that
the college community was not approach
ed in preparing the report Luebben said
the 2000 Foundation made a big mistake by
not utilizing members at the college com-
munity, “I’m sure many Grinnell pron
fessors and students could have put
together a much more complete and per-
sonal report than an outside firm.” Luebr
ben pointed to many research projects
Grinnell students have done on everything
from hospitals to churches in the town of
Grinnell.

Yet, Douglas Caulkins, Professor of Ann
thropology, said of the Naisbitt report, “it
is not useless research.” Although
Caulkins admitted that much of the final
report did not depend on the survey, he did
say the survey “provided good ideas and
recommendations." Caulkins said, “Grin~
nell has not declined” and stressed that the
Grinnell 2000 foundation is a Worthwhile
organization and the “Naisbitt report is a
very important document.”

Ggrinnellians Participate
in Mideast Conference

by Sam Afridi and Laurie Dunivant

While most Grinnell students were baskr
ing in the sun over Spring Break eight
Grinnellians. drawn by common interest
in Middle Eastern politics, ventured to
Washington, D.C. to particiate in the
Fourth Annual Model League of Arab
States. After researching tor several mon-
ths under the leadership of Political
Science professor Robert Grey, the Grin-
nell delegation went to American Universir
ty in Washington D.C. prepared to repre
sent the African/Arab country Somalia.

Since 1983 the Arab League of states, in
cooperation with many Middle Eastern
specialists. has sponsored this program in
order to provide college students with the
unique opportunity to assume the roles of
Arab diplomats, and witness firsthand the
internal workings of a bureaucratic inter-
national organization. T‘Nenty—one Arab
governments, including the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, were
represented at the conference by univer-
sities from all around the United States,
Four days of heated debate resulted in a
rare learning experience for all who at-
tended,

The conference began with lectures by
several Middle Eastern experts, including
the renowned Dr. Clovis Maksoud, perma-
nent observer of the Arab League at the
United Nations, who urged participants to
“look upon this experience as an oasis of

objectivity in a duert of American subjec»

tive attitudes towards the Arab situation."

Following his keynote address was the
adoption of the agenda, which was strictly
., adhered to throughout the session.

The next morning the delegation travell-
ed to the Somali embassy at the Watergate
Complex, where they were briefed for two
hours by Ambassador Abdulkanin Ali
Omar on Somali policies in the Arab world.
The students then returned to American
University. where they divided and went to
five committee sessions, each dealing with
a salient aspect of Arab affairs, Hamid
Amjadi and Laurie Dunivant participated
in the Political Committee, Will O’Malley
a nd Todd Truther debated Economic Cum~
mittee issues, Scot Breckenridge lobbied
in the Legal Affairs Committee, Lorelei
Kelly and Sam Afridi tackled the Commit»
tee on Palestine, and Shannon McDonald
slept through the monotony oi the Social
and Cultural Affairs Committee.

Most of the substantive bargaining took
place in the two days of committee ses-
sions. It was there that delegates brought
up resolutions to various questions,
debated them, revised them, and eventual-
ly came to agreement on them. Lorelei
Kelly remarked that, “During committee
sessions, I felt a passionate attachment to
the policies of Somalia. and actually felt as
though I were a diplomat." One Somali
delegate, displaying sincere anger and
