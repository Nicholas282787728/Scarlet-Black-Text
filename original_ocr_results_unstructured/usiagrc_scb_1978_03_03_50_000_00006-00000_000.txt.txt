There are live films this week so
I'll keep these descriptions brief.

The feature of the weekend is
The Mall in the Glass Booth, at
recent release co-sponsored by
Associated Jewish Students.
Academy award nominee
Maximilian Schell, an excellent
actor. stars in this story of a man,
Arthur Goldman, who IS captured
and brought to trial by the state oi
lsracl ror crimes against
humanity

But, during the trial, Goldman's
real identity becomes ambiguousi
was he an SS Colonel, a Jewish
prisoner, a GermansJew, or,’in the
melodramatic words of the press
release, “is he one us, all at us?”
The him is an engrossing,
suspensciul drama-mystery with
comic overtones and it moves at
breakneck speed Lois Nettleton
coasters, Arthur Hiller (alright, he
did make Love Story but we're all
entitled to one mistake) directed.

Daughters, Daughters, the other
Jewish Cultural Weekend film,
looks to be even better. Moshe
Mizrahi, the most popular of
Israeli filmmakers, directs this
acid comedy. The plot involves an
arrogant father of eight daughters
who transfers his longing for a son
into an obsession for an heir. The
film did very well abroad; the
critics called it “one of the funniest
satirical comedies" and “a rich
lame and human comedy. A very
successiul film."

Nothing But a Man is here Ior
Black Prospective‘s Weekend.
Independent filmmakers Michael
Roemer and Robert Young
directed this movie, which was the
highlight or the 1965 New York
Film Festival. ivan Dixon and
singer Abbey Lincoln play’a black
couple living in the modern South.
The young man is a free spirit,
quick to rebel, and struggles
against a hostile white society. The
film's near-documentary style is

Judith Crist wrote that the film
“sets a towering standard for its

The |ilm iioir fan club has been
steadily growing on campus. Now
you too can enjoy the seedy vision
oi American llfe with the third film
noir selection, Murder My Sweet.
Phillip Marlowe is a seedy private
eye who has the simple job at
trailing a punchy ex-con’s blonde
girl iriend. Suddenly he acquires a
suspicious lot of clients who hire
him, point guns, strangle,
threaten. blackjack, and nearly
beat him to death; we all know the
Ieeling.

Chandler‘s tawdry atmosphere is
enhanced by the shabby sets and
brutally-fast direction of Edward
Dmytryk, It's hard to believe that
the man playing the hard-boilcd
Marlowe was also the fresh-faced
tenor partner of Ruby Keeler in the
Golddigger films, but Dick Powell

The late Raymond Chandler
regarded Murder My Sweet as the
most successlul adaptation of any
of his novels.

Last Year at Marienbad was one
of the most controvelsial works of
the French New Wave. Directed by
the superb Alain Resnais
(Hirushima Mon Amour,
Providence) and written by Alain
Robbc-Grillet, the film is a
surrealistic account of an incident
at a somber, palatial hotel.
Delphine Seyrig is a beautiiui
guest who meets a man who tries to
convince her that they have met
and fallen in love once before,
“perhaps at Marienbad." Although
she,,.,dqe§n’t remember, ‘she
eventually abandons her husband
to leave with the stran er.
Resnais‘s films are time ess
unique, and intense, built on a
dream-like structure in which the
audience loses all sense of reality.

“In my opinion, the SGA this
year has really created a bad
image of itself and indeed hasn’t
accomplished much, so therefore,
this business is a reﬂection of that
image," he said. ‘

Winick pointed out that he did not
intend to undermine the electoral
process.

“I hope to stimulate interest in ‘

the SGA as an organization. I did
not intend. . . to sabotage the SGA
. . . it was strictly a senior prank,"
he said.

The election board chairman is
not relishing counting the ballots.

“If I didn't have to run the
damned election, I’d consider it a
good joke carried Io the point of
simple nominations, But going
from the nomination stage to being
on the ballot changes the whole
situation," Ruth said.
