O Princes or Paupers.

Great was our surprise and pleasure to dis-
cover that the faculty had adopted our sug-
gestion for a benefit musical and dramatic
production for the Red Cross. They have
risen magnificently to the occasion with a
creation that promises to be hilarious, in-
structive and intense.

Still, the original purpose of the show
must not be overlooked.

Advance reports have it that all students
are to be admitted free of charge who have
Gadabout tickets. Almost 80% of the stu-
dent body will witness the production with-
out cost. How will the Red Cross fare under
such an arrangement?

A nominal sum should be charged all stil-
dents. The merit of the play warrants it;

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the faculty will be stimulated to nobler cf-
forts. Then the school will be making a
truly worthwhile contribution to the Red
Cross program.

How about it students? Are we princes
ol' paupers?

0 Presidential Timbre.

With the position of student council presi-
dent comes a certain amount of honor, as it
should.

However, the post is far from being mere—
ly honorary, It entails more hard work than
any other student-held office on the cam-
pus,

When the candidates are this
should be kept in mind.

Personal integrity and personality are not
enough. A good council president must have
the real qualities of a leader. He must have
the perseverance for long hours of hard
work. He must have tact and understanding.

Above all, he should be absolutely depend-
able in any situation.

Few men have the qualities to fill such a
position. Pick your candidate carefully.

0 Liquor and Defense.

Tile New State owned liquor store has sold
a total of 5535,09 in defense savings stamps

Air Corps Technical School

A majority of the young men who are at the right age to enlist in the

Army air corps have the mistaken impression that all they will be

taught is how to fly. If they are for some reason or other ineligible,

they may still find a place in the air corps.

Poor eyesight is no reason for giving up the army air
corps.

On the contrary, the au- corps is anxious to find men who are
grilling to take other jobs just as valuable in these times of national

e ense.

Another point in its favor is the fact that the majority of courses
offered to enlisted men by the air corps technical school will prove of
great value to you after the wnr is ended.

The basic course includes air corps fundamentals, shop mathe-
matics, elements of electricity, elements of metalwork, mechanical
drafting and blueprint reading.

mean, Explosives and Ammunition, Aircraft machine guns, chemical

Warfare Materials, Bomb sights and Bomb Racks, Small Arms, and

AIRCRAFT WELDEKS: The Fabrication and Repair of Welded Air-
craft Metals, and the Care and Operation of Tools and Equipment
of the Air Base Metal Shop,

AIR/CRAFT MACHINISTS: Grinding Machines, Lathes, Forging and
Heat Treating, Milling Machines and Shapers.

RADIO REPAIR-ERS AND OPERATORS: Includes Typewriting, Ra~
cliu Procedure, International Morse Code, Principles of Radio Com-
munlcation, etc.

tography, Mosaic and Mapping. Principles of Photography, Photo-

Schuler Receives
Strange Notes

An anonymous lass, presumably of
quadrangle variety, has been send~
ing anonymous letters to Louis
Schuler. business manager of the
1942 Cyclone. The letters bear die
signature “Delicate Tess Ann.”

It seems that the girl is seek-
ing a position on the business end
of what she calls “Grinhell’s supci-
publication, the Tornado Scandal."

The only drawback to such a
position. she asserts, would be the
fact that she would have to work
among men, who she describes as
“the flat tires on the wheels of
progress." .

“I would really welcome another
aide," Schuler said. “but 1 don’t
know just who to call on for this
voluntary assistance.”

The Grinnell College Glee club re-
cently purchased a new set of
choral music risers from the Pay-
son Company of Hebrbn, Neh,
Robert Page, president. announced
today.

The purchase, which was the
result of the club's decision to
donate something durable to the
college as memorial to past clubs,
will be for the use of the college
glee clubs and choirs, Page stated.

In spite of priorities, rubber
treading to stand on and brass
fixtures were obtained for the
three rows of risers. They are
adjustable to accomodate any
number up to 64, Page stated.
He continued that the stands are
collapsible. portable. light and
easily moved.
