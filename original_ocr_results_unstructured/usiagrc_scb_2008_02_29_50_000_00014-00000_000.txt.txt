“There e a lot or students who engage iii

Young, “It is dangerous to not let students have

Even if time is not taken away from [he ath-

Wheeling and dealing

Much like the surprise encounter between Kermit Wilslit
ingtori and Rudy Tomjanovich (1). the unexpected fluriy of
NBA deals has left me floored, In H league where iecent deadt
lincs have come and gone with little ofintcrest occiiriing, it was
a pleasant surprise to see several important deals made on or
before Feb. 21.

Now,l normally have only sporadic interest in (lie NBA
OutSldC of the Timberwolves, and since their season has been
lelegated to “tanking for Michael Beasley" staais (2), l have
only been able to find solace in the improvement of our young
players But when that “improvement" comes during a 15,
maybe 20, win season, it's hard to stay focused on the game of
basketball,

Amazingly, with this slew of trades, I have become some
what interested in the NBA as a whole. Sure I don't much like
the idea of

ing down

fense, but
the thought
otwatching
him run up and down the court, trying to keep pace with his
teammates, in a way that is reminiscent of one of the Molina
brothers legging out an infield single, greatly amuses me.

turn even more intrigued hy the thought of the Hawks front
office actually realizing how to put a team together. They ﬁ’
iially have a point guaid in Mike Bibby, and I would be thlilled
to see them actually make the playoffs. Then again, had they
not made an ill-advised promise to a inediocie big-man in the
zooo draft, they could have just gotten Brandon Roy (among
other draft blunders that would make evenJets fans cringe), but
let’s hope they've moved on from decisions like these,

Ofcourse, the Lakcrs'rccent trade for Pau Gasol sets up the
possibility for a LakcrstCeltics finals. a marchup sure to cause
most fans to feel the same pain and sense of shame that Tony
Allen felt when he injiiied his knee (3). When your team is
doing pooily, naturally you stint looting for a couple of teams

don’t want to see do well, and for the NBA, for me, that team
is [lie Lnkci‘s. When you see a trade like that go down, it just
frustrates other team’s fans. I mean, it was so lopsided it would
make the lVlonti'eal Expos think they could have gotten more
for Delino DeShields. Even more upsetting is that the deal
makcs it exponentially harder to root against them, because
they are .i solidly entertaining team.

Luckily, with the recent loss of the Patriots, I feel much
freer to root for KC and the Celtics if such an unfortunate
incident as CelticsLakets does occur. Then again, do 1 really
want to be as pathetic as Boston fans were when Ray Boul‘que
left? Fortunately, I don‘t see that as being possible, ill be happy
to see him nan, hut l'm suie not going to thiow a huge party for
him in the middle ofivlinnuapolis.

Honestly though, no inattci what the pioinisc is for (lie upr

to watch. In terms oi sports, until the start of baseball, March

just have to do.
