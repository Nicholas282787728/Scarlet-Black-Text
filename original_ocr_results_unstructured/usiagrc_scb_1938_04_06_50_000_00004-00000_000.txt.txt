OUR PLATFORM FOR A BETTER
GRINNELL COLLEGE

1. Reorganization of the Band.

.7 2. Modernization and Simplification of
I Grade and Cut systems,

3. Greater Support for Glee Clubs, 0
cllestra, Debate and similar organiz
tions.

4. Encouragement of the Development
of the White house into a student union.

5. Improvement in Athletic facilities.

WE'VE HITCHED OUR WAGON
TO A STAR

it is not without trepidation that we take
over the administration of the SCARLET
AND BLACK. Nor, perhaps, is this feeling
without precedent.

At the same time we are starting our
regime with high aspirations and higher
ideals. While it may be Said that “fools
rush ill where angels fear to tread," we are
doing so filled with the confidence that
comes with youth and fired by a very real
desire to do big things this coming year.

To those who have gone before us, we
owe a great deal, for they have set up a
standard which will be hard for us to pass.

Yet. we hope to do just that thing,

With this issue we are inaugurating a
new editorial program, a program with but
one purpose, the development of Grillnell
college and those connected with it along
lilies cognizant with the ideal of a liberal
education.

As a fir step in this program, we have
set up l’ivc' projects which we believe are
a means to that and. Some are obviously
far out of reach at the present time; others
we hope will be r dlizcd during our admin-
istration.

From time to time other projects will
be added, and conceivably some may have
to be dropped before they become realities.

However, that may be, one thing is Sill .

Though the means may change, the end
will remain the same.

All this is in line with what. wu believe
to be, not only our duty, but our privilege.

We have been given an opportunity to
Serve our chosen School. We believe we may
best do this by serving as a unifying ills
flucnco, a guide as it were, for the energies
of students and faculty toward A commonly
desired goal.

GRLNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Ours now is the task of translating these
ideals into concrete and realistic terms.

This, to the best of our ability, and with
the aid and advice of faculty and students,
we shall endeavor to do ill our editol al
columns.

Yes, it’s tluc we‘re aiming high, but we’ve
hitched our wagon to 2\ star and from here
it looks like a good ride.

‘ IT CAN BE icdlhnisrﬁ

The vote at the present Student Council
favoring the recommendations of the com-
mittee on balld reorg nizntion is of dccp
signiilcance in that it holds up hope that
definite action may now be taken leading
toward more suitable backing forthc g oup.

To be sure, thc present Council did not
itself take definite action, for th‘t will be
the function of the new Counc , It did
however vote to recommend the changes to
the new Council.

Under the plan proposed by the Council
the band would receive a total of $400 a
year income. With this it seems probable
that the band could afford to go ahead with
plans for enlargement and purchase new
uniforms

Should the licw setup be adopted, the
band will become an organization inde-
pendent of the athletic department, which,
while it Served a useful purpose ill harbor-
ing the hand during bad times, is not the
place for a musical organization.

All this is not, however, an accomplished
matter.

With suppolt of the student body it can
and should be accomplished.

ACTION FOR Mllﬁ

In line with the wide awake attitude of
the White house committee, the spring
recess was used to advantage as a time to
move the ping pong equipment there to
newly arranged rooms in the basement of
the house.

Certain advantages of the new arrange»
ment are obvious. Tile new rooms are
cooler and better lighted than were the
roolns upst‘irs and will nrovide better
facilities for real fast play.

The important thing, however, is not the
change itself, but rather that the change
was made. It is by Such thinking action
that the White house, or any other project,
becomes a truly valuable addition to the
school.

TIMELINESS IN THE llBTAnv

The prescnt exhibit in the library ill coll—
nectioll with the Harl 1. Worth prize for
the best personal liblaly owned by a senior
has again brought to our nttcntion the f ct
that the library displays are outstanding in
quality and timeliness.

Much is to be gained by the average stu—
dent if he will but take a few moments to
study the displays on the tables near the
main door of the lib! ry.

Those who will take the trouble to 100k
will find a new source of pleasure as well
as information in the work being done

THE FIRST “RT

(Reprinted From The Daily O’Collcgian)

01' tllc “three R’s” which people are Supr
posed to have mastered in elementary
school “to the tune of n hickory stick,"
the first, reading, is about the most im-
portant, most difficult, and consequently
the least learned. Comparatively l'ew col-
lege students can read. For this reason
many have difficulty with their studies.
The so~called bookish ability is what stu—
dents need above all other things.

Perhaps the elementary schools do not
place enough emphasis on plain, unadorned
learning. Perhaps some of the modem 1' US
should be lopped bit high school and grade
school curricula for concentration on the
"three R’s."

DORIC

A new lulmiuistrntiun hikes
over control of the s a: B, the
”dearly beloved SCARLET AND
BLACK," as President Nollen once
i-cfci-red to it, and with it comes
i}. new Doric editor. Two years
ago the highest late of tournovcr
was in the business manager’s
posllon Apparently Doric hes
usurped the above honor this year.

So far as we can recall, each
succeeding Doric editor pledged
himself to some sort of a pro-
gram, either upon his own free
will or upon the recommendation
of the editor. To order to “get
in the groove snd ride on
through” (must be the influence
of B. Goodman and band playing
“Tiger Rag" st the moment that
provoked the above trite phrase).
We, too, will venture c program.

s e v

First, Doric will be clean. we
hope. Second, Doric will not in-
tentionally tread on people's toes,
unless we hear something too
good to keep still. Third, Doric
hopes that if you feel hurt at
some personal reference in its
column, you‘ll understand that no
affront was meant and that you’ll
"forgive and forget.” Fourth, if
you have a little anecdote not in
conflict with our policy and still
worth telling i if such is possi-
ble). you might jot it down, en—
close some in envelope, seal ftl‘mr
ly, ask one of the boys in the
bookstore to drop it in the S &
B box, and nwsit developments.

Highlights of the vacation,
judging flom current leports,
were. first, the feuding in one of
the hotel rooms occupied by some
of the senior boys on the Chicago
uvocational" survey with Park,
Wittrock, Bar ett, Kallal, and
Yaeger as participants.

WM]. it seems that it good
Brown Derby is assured this year
with the announcement that Earl
“Father" Hines and his orchestra
have been sigmed to furnish the
music. And from us to Sigma.
Delta cm, a salvo of praise for
contracting one of the BIG
colored bands in the country,

Otto Gustni‘son believes he was
“j xed” before he left here last
Friday for the holidays. Before
he was well underway, one of the
rods in his new car broke and
drove through the crankcase, he»
cessitsting a return and repair
job, Then when he got home,
everything proceeded fairly well,
until the day before he left when,
while out driving with his father
and brother, the parental machine
[igilred in an accident, and “Gus"
picked up some broken ribs and
bruises.

s s

Then therc were those who
couldn't make the tram, including
McEwen, who leads with the story
that he didn't know what time
the train pulled out of the Chicago
station. Jamison and Pcnnock
stick to their story that they left
the train at Rock Island so that
they could get a sandwich

The Glec club girls also relate
with relish their race against time
through the Chicago streets, when
they found themselves several
miles away from the radio station
over which they were to broad—
cnst with only a few minutes in
which to cover the ground. They
reached the goal Just in time to
line up in front of the "mike”
and sing.

uctly Ciu'lles' “job hunt" in St.
Louis, she says, was wolth more
to llel' than the trip into Chicago
could possibly have been.
