CLASS DAY EXERCISES.

New Class Day ngrain to be Given
at CommencementeHope to
Make it Traditional.

For some time there has been
agrowing teeiing of dissatisfuce
tion on the partof the faculty.as
wellas the alumni and commence-
ment visitors, with regard to the
part which the graduating classes
have had in the commencement
exercises. For several years
there has been no distinctive
class day program. the recent
classes contenting themselves
with a class play, to rviriclt was
attached in a very incongruous
manner tire class poem and the
mantle oration, the latter being
the only traditional feature of the
whole program. Betti these,
however. were matte decidedly
subordinate to the play, which
coaéd not be p
charging a tair sized admission
fee, The result was that the vise
itors saw very little of the class,
and that little upon the payment
of the admission price of the
play,

This year a more pretentious
program Will be presented, which
it is hoped will meet with the lull
approval of students and visitors
alike. About a month ago the
faculty made their desires known
to the class, a committee of the
class was at once appointed to
make a thorough investigation
and recommend to the class a
suitable class day program. A
neck ago the report of the come
mittee was accepted by the class.
and at the meeting of the taculty
Friday afternoon it was submitted
for tltclrconsideration, and receiv-
ed their lull approval.

The details of the program
have not yet been \vorkcd out,
but the outline can now be given.
The whole of Tuesday of come
mencemeut week will be given
over to the graduating class. in
the forenoon will occur the literary
part of the class day program,
which will consist of a class ora-
tion, the mantle motion, a class
history,and both vocal and instru-
mental music.

The afternoon will be given to
out—of door exercises. The priur

Academy basket ball team defeats
ed West Des i\’loines High School

ﬁrst venture in academy atlilelic

but there were scarcely over ﬁfty
spectators in the gallery to wit-
The

tress this initial game.
the true Grinnell spirit was much
in evidence, {or the \Vcst; Des
Moincs boys were applauded on
every good play and were shown
that they had the sympathy ofthe

audience. It was an uplrrii ﬁght

tor the visitors and no doubt the
superior advantages ot

'Vu'sity pr .vc
in a measure responsible tor the
large score of the academy team.
in the ﬁrst half the preps rolled
up 27 points and the West Des
Mnincs boys made one basket.-

In the second half West Des
Moines began to play ball and
alter ﬁlteen minutes of ﬁne team
work- on their part and equally
vigorous detensrve work on the
part of Grinnell, tlt_c result shows
ed Grinncll the victor by a score
of 32 to 3.

TALK BY MR. Vl’l‘TUM.

The number of those present
last night at Institute Hall to hear
Mr. Vittui-n's informal talk
so small that a feeling of shame
forbids its publication). The sub
jcet under consideration was the
historical cvidcnces ol the authenr
ticity of the books of the New
Testament. Mr. Vittum gave
this talk once before to the Bible
study classes, and by request gave
it again last night. Many inter.
esting facts wcrc brought out
about the writings of the Apostles
and theearly leaders in the church,
and a very proﬁtable hour was

team a good meet to steady the

state meela‘r Coe has many friends
at Cedar Rapids who claim that
her team is slronger than that of
Grinncll, and this meet will give a
good opportunity to learn the com-
parative strength of the two
schools. The students of (Ice
College feel that they are able to
meet Grinncll on equal terms but
have had no chance to do so in
the past on account ofinability lo

manager will ttil<cto Cedar Rapids
as many of the point winncrs at
the home meet as the expense oi
the trip will permit. More than
twenty men will be taken.

For the same date negotiations
are on for a meet between the men
who do not malrc the team anti
the Giinnell high school team.
This meet is arranged especially
for the Academy but nearly all

be allowed to cnlcr. This
will give these men a chance to
gain the experience of competi-
tion, thus givingthcm an incentive
to keep out and train and putting
them in better shape tor the track
team next year. Manager Chase
is thus looking out for the interests
of the team a year or two hence as
well as for the present seoson.

BASEBALL MEN TO TRAIN,

Trnitict' Watson is to have the
candidates {or the baseball team
under his care, and the physical
conditlon of the men lvill be looked
after in the same manner as dur-

ing the tootbaii season. such. at

least has been the decision of the
Board oi Control anrl.iudccd,work
has already begun.

The results of this move will be

awaited with eagerness. There

can bc no doubt that the poor
showrng made by the team last
year was largely due to a iacic or

proper physical training It was

not lack of skill nor ignorance of
the game which brought deteat,
but the inability ofthe men to en-
dure haid. fast playing throughout ,
the entire game. This is an un-
usual condition for Grlnncll athe
Ietes, and it is‘with thc hope of
overcoming this difficulty that the
present arrangement has been et-
fected.

THE MuSic FESTIVAL,

ments have been made with the

gush composer, author of Hiawar
tha‘s Wedding, and The Death of
