0 Next Year’s Staff?

Occasionally tllere arises a situation on the
Scarlet and Black in which the future of
the paper does not appear especially bril-
liant.

This year more clouds than ever over-
cast the horizon, for as yet there are no
strong candidates for either editor or busi—
ness manager of the paper next year. And
on the Zephyr, there is no really strong
candidate for editor.

Several factors have brought about this
situation. They are:

1. The emphasis of the administra-

Plan International
Relations Meeting

Cyclone - -

tion on liberal arts, which brought
about the abolishmcnt of the jour-
nalism department, and may lead to
the downfall of the art and drama
departments

2. Increased study activity which, as
palt of a new curriculum, reduces
the amount of time a student has
free for cxtra»cl.irricular energies.
3. A decline in the profits of the
paper which has practically killed
any financial incentive one might
have for ti lug to become edltOl

Griilllell has a 'ch history in publi l—
tions. it is the smallest snool in the coulr
try to have a chapter of Si ‘ma Delta Chi
and Theta Sigma Chi, pi'oi'es ' rial jour-
nalistic fraternities for men and .omen. No
other school of (350 students can boast a.
seiniewcekly newspaper, a humor magazine,
a litei‘l'y magazine, and an annual.

If it becomes necessary for the paper to
be directly subsidized by the college, it
would rapidly deteriorate into an official
announcement sheet.

6 The Gates Lectures

Finding an answer, or even fomrlulating an
intelligent question concerning spiritual
realities in a constantly changing external
world, has always been of primary interest
to Grinnell students. That is why the Gates
Memorial lecturesappeal to the thinking
Grinnellian as a privilege and a challenge.

Although s idents seldom find in these
lectures speci 'c, concrete solutions for
the crisis which they must face personal-
ly, as well as nationally and interna-
tionally, they do find thinking tremendously
stimulated and elevated above the common-
places of every day living.

The lectures which Dr. Bernard Iddings
Bell has already delivered recently prove
that the 1941 Gates Memorial lectures are
no exception to the established Grinnell
tradition of distinctive and cogent presen~
tations.
