M0 OPOLY AND EDUCATION
Declaring that the subsidizing oi

monopoly interests is making educa-

ment, reminiscent of Upton Sinclai s
”Goose-stop.”

The Senator points out that‘ the

, growth of the subsidy system in our

nnivcr. ties and colleges is contempor-
aneous with the growth or monopoly
in industry, and maintains that high.
