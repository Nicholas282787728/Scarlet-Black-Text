Berne; Malieasér
Emphasizes Sales,
Short on Quality

By Sue Bernc

A former baseball player and
comic, Al Sohacht, tells a story
about his entry into the ﬁeld
of journalism; “The newspapel
business is a great business," his
mother told him, “so sell as
many as you can,” if this isn’t
quite as funny as the one about
the girl who swallowed the
olive, it nevertheless more sullr
ably highlights the situation in
regard to the new Malteascr, a
humor magazine.

Malteaser policy is misguid—
ed: first in the assumption
that campus humor can only
be expressed through satiric
attack; and second, that hu-
mor is necessarily incompat—
ible with literary quality,
In the ﬁrsl issue, the start has

undertaken to analyze the Grin-
nell social program, the commit-
tee jungle, and the process of
birth. By choosing
which lack humor, the writers
force themselves into a devious
approach in which the mechan-
ics of satire are used to com-
pensate for the absence of nu»
mor. Obscurity passes for subtle-
ty, crudeness takes the place of
wit, and labored metaphor gets
by as ”theme.” It’s boring.

The decision to imitate the
style and composition of a
university h u m o r magazine
was a miserably unfortunate
one: the corresponding publi-
cations oi the Ivy League and
the Big Ten are, themselyes,
only attempts to adapt the
tone of certain national magar
zines (la the interests of a par-
ticular campus. The intended
sophisticated ribaldry doesn’t
quite reach our end of the
chain.

1 think it’s about time we
stopped trying to fool ourselves
with unbranded livestock, bark-
ing dogs, and the like. Perhaps
we should reject the whole con-
cept of the experiment or the
workshop. Too many people are
satisﬁed with this kind of inter-
mediate product, in which the
halt—baked good try is encourage
ed over the betterrthan—average.

The Malteaser may even last
until most of its present staff
has graduated; a lapse of two
'or three years will precede
the introduction of a similar
project, which probably won't
be very much better. Every
attempt will fail until the
people who can write and
cartoon are willing to cooper.
ate with the people who are
capable of promoting a good
magazine, The immaturity and
lack of taste exhibited by the
current Malteaser are not
nearly as serious as the re.
sentment effected by the able
students who reiuse to help.
and are the lirst to be or-
fended.

The Malteascr is so bad that

Review Finds Unbranded Calf
Siill ln 'Workshop' Siege"

By Gene Thompson

1 have just finished reading, for the lust lime, the manuscripts
which will be printed in the forthcoming issue of Maveirck. What
the “unbranded calf with a mind of its own" Will do them in [Jun—
lication. 1 don't know. I’ll do what I can in the way of “review" and

”criticism.”

Jim Ward's “The Stovepipe"
introduces us to Josh, a back-
woods boy who has never
heard of “American culture at
mid-century." He is depicted
as being better off tor it, and
the story escapes the usual
unspoiled - nature ~ I) o y idyll.
The “problem oi the stove-
pipc" is ingeniously contrast-
ted with the problcms of
modern scientific man, al-
though it inspires some
thought in the reader that
could have been recorded in
the story.

Camille Blaszczyk’s “Hints to
the New Salesgirl at Marshall
Field Who is Taking my Place,“
is refreshing. While it reviews
the gallery of typical customer-
problems, it does so with some
innovations. pregnant Woman is

is still any value in literacy,
original thinking or good spells
ing, if any Grinnell college
magazine is ever to be permas
nent, it just might be worth—
while to develop this one. it's

new enough and bad enough.
