Everyone likes
an A.
Thus, many oriniicle
lians may be reluctant to call
grade inﬂation a problem. At
t highly-ranked and challenging
liberal arts institution, many nicmr
bers of the campus community think
that high giades are the natuial prod-
uct of1i quality student body
Stet of the 9868 grades given for four
or five ciedlt classes in the 2003 2004
school-ye1ii,s9 pcicent were between A and
B. The average Grinnellirin has a GPA of
3.26.
Jim Swartz, dean ofAcademic Affairs, agrees
that the grades at Grinnell seem to be on the high
end, but said this Is not unusual,“Ifyou look at the
grade distribution ofGrinnell and these other lnstlt
tutions [in the Associated Colleges of the Midwest],
we're kind ofin the middle of the pack,” he said.
statistics on campus tvido grade distribution have
been publicly available since 1997, and since then the
number ofA’s and A- s has increased from 38 4 percent
of the total to 46 7 percent
These rising numbers are consistent with it national
trend that has garnered attention largely because of Ivy
League statistics. In 2001, the New Yer/t Timer ran a con-
troversial story about grade inﬂation at Harvard, dCSCUb’
ing inﬂation as giving higher grades for assignments than
the same \voikwould have merited in the pastAccording
/ to the Timzl, about 50 percent of the grades given out at
- Harvard are in the A rangeiover twice as many percents
agerwise as in 1986.

Is there reallyaproblemi
Grade inﬂation as a nationwide phenomenon is a
widely accepted fact, but at Grinnell, there is debate over
whether or not there is a problem.
“This is a private college," Gregory Schneider '05
\ i. said, “We get to select whoever we want to come here,
a so almost no one comes here as a lowachieving stu'
dent." He also credits professors for the high grades
bccause they“takc thc time to make sure that every
one is following along. "
While many Grinnellians think that Grinnell's
r, grade curve is acceptable, some faculty members
, disagree.
'r “In the long run," said Chris French, Math,
_ “if everything becomes all As, then there's
“ \ nothing to distinguish one student from an—
other, and that could have a tangible impact
on students [because] the student who’s
doing really well wouldn't look any dif-
_ fercnr from the student who's just gets
ting by."
Victoria Brown, History, sees
grades that are too uniformly
‘ high as an injustice to students.
"I think that a lot of students
, would say ‘I would rather
« V have a grade that means
\ somcthing,'"shc said

other institutions, professors should
give an inordinate number of high grades ‘It’ you guys
come in smart she said, We should be making you jump
through some pretty high hoops.

Why all the high grades?
One reason for the higher grades could be, of course,
that students have ytist gotten smarter. But according to the
Grinnell admissions wcbpagc, students at Giinnell today
have only mtiginolly highei standardized test scores and high
school class rankings than they did in 1997. Faculty members
therefore speculate that other factors in r be at work.

French believes junioi faculty in piiti ulir rite under pres-
sure to give our good grades because “ifive give lower grades,
our student evaluations might suffer, and wc gct 1i little nervous
about that." He also thinks that “departments are under pres
sure to give higher giades because they want to attract man
jors "

Brown secs .i \vidcr problem with the pciccptiou ofgtitles
themselves. “What might help both snirleiits and faculty is to
think about the fact that a grade is not a payment," she said,

“’lts an assessment of the qual' of the work And for stur
dciits thats sometimes painful bo‘ ausc tl icy 1] think lworkcd
so hard "’ She also worries that students will be so focused on
what they perceive to be a poor giadc that they will not take
constructive criticism to heart,

Mark Schneider, Physics, doesn't pcrccivc gmdo inﬂation
itself as it major problem, but he beheves that changes in stu-
dent and faculty perceptions of what constitutes a bad grade
may be contributing to a higher curve. “The c sccms to have
becomes a stigmatized grade, and students are certainly upset
when they get a C, and faculty become reluctant to give a C,
that a C is seen as no unsatisfactory grade, when in fact, at?
cording to the deﬁnition ofa C, it is a satisfactory grade. "

Why the data is unavailable

For those who see grade inﬂation is a problcm, stopping it
is tricky business. It is difficult to pinpoint which departments
and courses may be giving out disproportionately high grades
because, while the campus wide gmdc distribution is publicly
available, only a department can ask for its own grade distribUr
tion. The History department exercised this right in Spring
2004, and found that the department gives out fewer A‘s than
the campus overall by almost 10 percent and significantly more
B’s in a pattern that has been more or less stable since 1997,

No other departments have requested their distribution
statistics, though a few professors, including French and John
Rommere'trn, Music, expressed interest in getting the data' in
the future. Religious Snidics department head Ed Gilday said
the department plans to request its grade distribution this se~
mester,

Nlore detailed statistics for all dcpartrncnts being publir
cizcd seems unliker According to the nonprofit group Stur
dent Press Law Center, private institutions like Grinnell are

not required to disclose them, and Swart—r said that the college

would not release data without faculty consent

Past faculty committees have not requested more informar
tion, and Swartz does not believe they are likely to change their
minds. He also said that the administration would support de-
partments if they wished to do more research on their own
grade distribution.

Administrators and faculty seem to agree that releasing
such information against a departments will could damage the
campus community. Brown fcars that“in a small community
that can devolve to the level of gossip."

Jean Ketter, Education, thinks that disparities between de—
partments’ grade distributions could be misleading. “I think it
would be invalid to assume that departments that have a lower
average grade have ‘harder’ courses,'" she said in an email to
the S698. -

Ketter believes that some departments and professors may
give out higher grades because they allow people to revise work
or are clearer about grading criteria, not because their stunt
dards me lower. “In my disciphiie, we are encouraged to see
students‘ poor performance on assessments (as reﬂected in low
grades) as a possible indication that we have not done a very
good job of teaching, not necessarily as evidence of rigor or
high standards,"she said.

French also thinks releasing such data could acmally make
grade inﬂation worse because departments might start com»

peting to inﬂate their grades to attract majors.

Is there a solution?
\ _ Stopping grade inﬂation

won’t

be an

scents any pro

posed solution
comes with serious
drawbacksr

While Mark Schneider
and Gregory sclineidei both said
that, ideally, Grinnell should eliniir
natc the grading system altogether,

Brown said this has failed at othei
institutions because of the large amount

of work involved in handing our written
evaluations for every student. French is do
concerned that students planning on attending
gindtiite school could be adversely affected be
cause universities my not consider students who
can't put1 a GPA on their application.

Similarly, Swartl pointed out that if Grinnell
drastically changed' its grade distribution and similar _
institutions did not, Grinnellians will] lower GPAS
would be at a disadvantage

French has considered the same problem with his
own gmding. “i suspect that there are a lot or [gradu-
atc] schools out there who wouldn’t look at a student ifI
gave them a B but then [I] said,‘This is an extraordinary
student. Look at my grading scale.”

Princeton's proposal to limir the number ofA's that can
be handed out comes with its own set oftroublcs. Accord
ing to The ”hr/Jingiml Port, Princeton professor Erica Slep
thinks the new policy will damage student community by
making students compete for i limited number of As.

Gregory Schucidcr is against instituting a uniform
gmding policy at Grinnell. “To say that some grades have
to fall along certain lines, even among the cream of the crop
that Grinnell selects, is sort ofridiculous,"hc said.

Other colleges have tried to clarify for both students
and faculty what the schools performance standards are,
in the hope that clearly defining what an A means and
what a C means will reduce grade inflation without haVr ‘
ing to impose a grade quota like Princetons. ,

°At Carleton College, for example, faculty panels as-
sess students’ writing and submit a portfolio for each I
student at the end of their sophomore year, which is ’
used to assess and improve the students’ performance
without the assessment reflecting in their GPA.

French proposed instead a solution that [tiles on
the conscientiousncss of individual profcssors, cxs
plaining that he tries to make sure his grades are
slightly below the campus average. “I think that if 1
we were all to do this, we could get things back to 11
a place where thcre is the possibility of reward
ing studcnts who are doing very, very well:

Should this solution fail French has a
slightly more radical scheme up his sleeve.

Since the biggest problem is “you can’t go
higher than an A, he suggests suppler '
menting our grades with new grades, ,
Like alpha and alpha-minus and al- , ,
phasplus, which would be above an
A." Of course, if the trend cons
tinries, students would evenmr ,
tlly become dissatisfied with
alpha. “And then we‘d add

“I in being _'
