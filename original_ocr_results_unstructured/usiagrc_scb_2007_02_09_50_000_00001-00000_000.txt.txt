plant

comes to Grinnell

BY TJ HAWLEV AND KATH-
RVN BENSON '

Developer's broke ground
recently in an unincorporated
area or Poweshiek county,
right outside Grinnell, for the
construction of a new C(lKr
nol plant. The plant will be
built south of lsSO and east
ornghway 146, about a mile
south ofthe city limits.

Construction of the plant
met with concern from mem,
bers of both the college and
the community. Residents
treat the plant site are in litir
gation with Big River Indus
trrcs. which is building the
plant along with us, BioDie-
sel, because of their concerns
over safety and [[ﬂfﬁCr

The sheer amount of was
ter used in the production of
ethanol has also produced
fears of a potential water
shortage iii the area around
the factory

According to Grinnell
City Manager Russ Behrens.
the plant would use water

making’a water shortage unr
likely. President of Big River
Resources Ray Deffenbaugh
said that the plant "should not
interfere with the town.

But others are worried
about the effects on students
Director of Campus Security
Steve Br'rscoc worried about
increased train and cat traffic
on and around the campus.

Behrcns said the plant
will lead to increased train
traffic on the campus with a
projected one additional 100-
car train passing through the
campus each day.

Director of Media In—
formation fot Union Paciﬁc
Railways James Barnes sought
to alleviate these concerns. “It
is premature to know what

the impact of a proposed
ethanol plant would be [on
train trafiicl,” he\ said But
students should be mindful
and be cautious at the grate
crossings"

Motc than traffic increas-
es, Briscoc is conccrnod about
the explosive properties or
ethanol.

“Sonic ctplosions have
gone on across the count
try—that is a concern," he
said. To address this concern,
said Btiscoe, Grinnell campus
safety will be working with
the city of Grinnell to create
an Emergency Response Plan
in the event ofslrch an explor
sion.

Dcttenbaugh emphasrzcd
that safety is a top priority in
the construction of the plant.

Jim Sumner,

Dean of

Admission, to step down

Bv Arsav RAPOPORT

Raven Burke '07 had a problem. She wants
ed to stay in Grinnell this semester continuing
her work in Admissions after her December
graduation, but had no job and no apartment.
in the midst of contusion, she named ro jim
Sumner, Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid, who promptly tried to and her a job and
a place to live. “Without him, this probably
would never have happened to me,"shc said.

Other students may not be so lucky in the
future. Jim sumner will step down in June,
after almost seven years at Grinnell, though
he will work next year for Grinnell College
admissions as a representative on the West
Coast. Tom Crady, Vice President of Student
Services, will head a search committee that
plans to replace Sumner by June.

While Sumner began thinking about
his departure earlier this year many staff memr
bets were surprised. “We thought it was a year
or two away," said Marlene Jacks, Associate
Dean of Admissions.

Burke agreed. “It was a little shocking for

all of us.”shc said.

During Sumner's tenure at Grinnell, he
drastically increased the school's applicant pool
and worked to build “ethnic diversity" on cam-
pus. The number of applications to Grinnell
rose from 2800 to 4000, according to Crady.

“We’ve had record years in terms of the
quality of students under his administrar
tron,"lacks said. “He’s been instrumental in
helping us open up new markets.“

Sumner pomts to his work increasing
diversity as one of his proudest accomplish
ments. He pushed to bring the Posse program
to Grinnell and tried to spread the word of
Grinnell to ncw places. Despite his pride,
Sumner only sees his work as part ora longer
process. “I wouldn’t want to imply that we're
where we need to be,"he said.

Sumner came to Grinnell from Willao
mettc University in Oregon in 2000 where
he was Dean of University Admissions. He
has worked principally in college admissions
since 1966, spending most of his time m or-

Behind the web code

By CID STANDIFER

These days, many prospective students
don't get their ﬁrst impression of Grinnell
by walking around campus, word of mouth
or even from the glossy postcard propaganda
sent out en masse by the college every school
year. The ﬁrst glimpse they get about the col-
lege is from the website: a long block or text,
two rows of buttons, and a series of pho-

tos from the college's database overlaid on a
chalkboard-blue background. Every few years
this image must change. The website is cur
rcntly in the midst ofa major redesign, giving
the programmers a chance to evaluate the site’s
strengths and ﬂaws. But the story behind the
websites design begins far from Grinnell. It
begins in Soviet Russia

Bands search for space

BY CID STANDIFER

Jennifer Bleniek rs not a rock musician, nor
is she a member ofa campus band, But Blen-
iek, the RLC of CND, has certainly suffered
from the problems posed by campus band
practice space issues, Her apartment is located
directly above the practice space in the Not-
ris basement. It is “overwhelming living over a
room that sounds like a rock concert is sound—
ing off,” she said by c—mail. The sound waves
cause vibrations in her ﬂoor, "or just [in] my
head."

In addition to bcing completely nn—sounth
proored, and, according to Freesound drrcctor
Eric Rohn '03, practically unrsoundproofrablc,
the Norris practice space has other serious
drawbacks. Multiple students claim that the
communal equipment in the Norris space is

often mistreated and broken. Furthermore, he-
causc thc space is m a dorm, the hours when
bands can practice are limited to bcnvcen
12:00 pm. and 8:00 pm.

While bands still use the space, many
think it is inadequate, Rohn believes that the
resulting difﬁculties in arranging practices
have greatly diminished the number of bands
on campus. “Last year, when there was Music
House space, there were a lot of active bands,"
he said, “I’d say ten to twelve This semester.
we've had about four or live bands that have
been active,"

Finding suitable practice space for bands
has become a more pressing problem since the
demise ot'Music House at the end oflast yearr
but according to Vice President of Student
