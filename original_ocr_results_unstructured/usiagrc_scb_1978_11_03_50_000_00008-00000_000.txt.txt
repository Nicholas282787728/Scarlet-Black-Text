In 1854 Emery 5 Bartlett received a letter from his rather
describing a new settlement of Congregationalists in Poweshiek
County. This settlement was later to become Grinnell. Bartlett,
originally from New Hampshire, moved to Grinnell soon ale
terwards. His journey and his experiences in the new community

In 1911, when Bartlett was 79, several oi his children and grand
children requested that he write them a formal letter detailing his
reminiscences, especially oi his life in pioneer lowa.

clipping. telling of a Christian
Congregational Colony just
starting at Sugar Grove,
Poweshiek County, lowa, and
asking me to go out and in-
vestigate; but beiore I was ready
to start he decided to come out
himself.

Monday morning September lath
we three hired a hack to take us to
Madison, the first forty miles of
our journey. Tuesday morning we
took the stage for Galena, where
we found the only railroad on the
route, iitteen miles to Dubuque.
Wednesday and Thllrsday took us

some fourteen by sixty feet and
seven feethigh, with a curved roof,
formed by bending green oak
boards, and as I afterwards
learned, affording very poor
protection from rain, when umr
brellas and even tables were at a
premium,

We were met at the door of this
“Long Home” tas it soon came to
be called) by Mr. and Mrs. Phelps
who gave us a cordial welcome,
and learning that we had had no
breakfast, proceeded to feed us the
most appetizing meal I had en,

ovcrnight, and Fridayto lowa City,
fo'rding the Cedar River and Cedar
Rapids, as there were no bridges
over either the Cedar or the
Mississippi yct Daylight Saturday
morning saw us well started on the
last lap of our journey.

WE WERE OUT early Sunday
morning. September 24th 1354,
ready for our four-mile walk to the
Colony where we could soon
discern a few low shantieS. on the
otherwise naked prairie.

We approached the largest
building, a long. low structure

a:

be held ill the same room Mr.
Grinnell preached, and a good
share of the people attended.
MRS. GRINNELL HAD been
here only a few days. witll little
Katie three years old, to whom I
soon became very much attached.
This September 24th, 1854 was a
perfect September day. and a
notable landmark in my life for in
all my travels had never Seen the
place where i wanted to stay, but
from the hour of my arrival here, I
felt that this was home, and have
never had any desire to change.
i have always felt under

obligation to Mr. and Mrs. Phelps
[or all they did for me while I was
with them, for I have always felt
that for some reason they favored
me above all the other boarders.
During this first winter Mr. and
Mrs. Grinnell kept house in one
room built on the south side of Mr,
Phelps house, as their own house
was not built until the next year,

YOU WHO HAVE never seen this
country except as it is now,
covered wtth cultivated fields and
trees, almost like a timbered
country, can scarcely imagine how
it looked then, with not a tree or
bush in Sight except to the south
west, where the grove could be
faintly seen three or four miles
away, but in any other direction
nothing as large as a hazel bush as
far as the eye could reach, Until
late in the fall there was not a shed,
or fence, or even a hitching post on
the prairie, all horses being tied to
wagons, in many of which people
were still living.

Almost every evening that first
fall we could see prairie fires in all
directions. Sometimes it even
looked like an almost continuous
circle around us; but of course it
was not continuous. as some fires
were many miles away, while
others were quite near. One
evening it came up to where the
Grinnell residence now stands and
burned a stack oi hay, and a pile oi
lumber which Mr Grinnell had
hauled from Muscatine tor his new
house,

UNTIL THE SUMMER of 1855
we were obliged to go to Westfield
for all our mail, and there was
great rejoicing when the iirst stage
coach came through, atter we had
marked a trail by plowing a iurrow
on each side for several miles; tho
they came this way only every
other day for some time

It was several years before we
had any sidewalks and sometimcs
when walking became almost
impossible. we would haul in straw
and spread it on the most
frequented paths, which would
help (or a tew days.

we were able after some years, to
put down, on some of the main
streets, two parallel llna of plank

‘ with a space oi one toot between

which was a great improvement
especially if one had practiced
tight rope walking, but was not an
ideal lovers walk.

Can you realize that there was
not a mile of railroad in the state

when i came here, and the only

wagon road near here was the old
state road, used by the stage
company, three miles south.

THERE WAS ONE time while
we were on the farm, January lst
1354, when for two nights and a day
at least, it was not safe to be far
from Shelter. lhad a yard full of
cattle, but for thirtyrsix hours I
could neither feed or water them.
The thermometer stood at forty
below zero, with the wind blowing
sixty miles an hour, and the air so
fullot snow that one could See but a
few feet away, so you can imagine
it was not very balmy outside. I did
not go to bed at all the second night
but stayed up and kept fire. Cattle
that were out in the stock fields,
were found after the storm stan-
ding up in the snowdriits frozen
stiff.

ln l856 in spite of my vigorous

protest, I was elected constable,
and my iirst job was drivmg to
Malcom about midnight, to arrest
a stage driver accused of stealing,
but that was easy as i caught him
asleep in bed.

THEN AMOS BIXBY was
having trouble with the Stage
drivers about tearing down his
fences and driving across his field
to avoid a mud-hole, and he called
upon me to go and lie under the
fence the greater part of one night
to arrest the driver; but it so
happened that they did not come
through that night. But 'a day or
two later he had Capt. Clark there
with a riﬂe, and when they started
through, Clark shot one of the lead
horses killing him instantly. The
stage company immediately sued
Bixby for damages, but after quite
a lengthy trial, in which Bixby was
his own lawyer, he was acquitted.

While I was attending this trial, a
man named Thomas, alias
Cumquick, was brought up ac-
cused of the murder of a man and
his wife Whose remains were found
hidden in corn shocks. just west of
Montezuma. it was a very
aggravated case. and no doubt of
his guilt: and when he applied for
and was granted a continuance, the
people were aroused and a crowd
gathered in the evening declaring
he should not leave town alive.

WHEN HOWEVER HE was
brought up again in June, and was
granted a change of venue to
Mahaska County, the crowd again
gathered with the murdered
woman‘s brother as leader, and he

was quickly taken to the west end

 

of Main St. where with a rope
throwh over a convenient limb he
soon expiated one of the most at-
troclous murders ever committed
in this vicinity.

But the worst job I had as cone
Stable was when I arrested a man
accused of horse stealing, for, as
we had no place at coniinement
here, or even in the county, I was
obliged to guard him for about a
week, until it was decided what to
do with him. Then Oskaloosa being
the nearest jail. i was ordered to
'take him there. So with a driver
from the livery stable. I took him
there only to find that they had
disposed of their jail, and were no
better off than we; so the only thing
to be done was to guard him
another night at home

THE NEXT MORNING I took
another start by stage for Iowa

Josiah Bushne“ Grinnell

City, expecting to reach there the
same night; but the roads were bad
and night overtook us at Marengo.
By this time i was getting tired, but
I had the landlord lock us in a room
and sleeping with one eye open l
managed to get through another
night and the next afternoon
reached lowa City There they told
me their jail was not safe and
advised me to go on to Davenport;
but I had had enough of his com»
pany and didn't care much if he did
escape alter he was off my hands,
so I told them he was good and I
guessed wouldn’t try to break out,
and left him.

I think with Mr. Grinnell I can
claim the honor of setting out the
first trees on the prairie. Very
early in the spring of 1355 before
even a bush was started, as i had a
horse and wagon, Mr. Grinnell
proposed that he and i go to the
grove for a load of small trees, of
which he set a part on the lots
where he was about to build, and I
put the rest in front of where i now
live. The most of these lived for a
year or two and then died a natural
death as the prairie was not then a
congenial home for the timber
trees,

While the writing (of this letter)
has called up some sad memories,
as well as pleasant ones, on the
whole 1 have enjoyed it and only
Wish I had an abler pen with which
to express my thoughts; but I am'
sure your love will overlook all
taults and put the best possible
construction on everything I have '
said. Very affectionately yours,

Emery Sargent Bartlett.
