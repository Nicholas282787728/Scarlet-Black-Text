Antenna orsupcnpower transmitter

From the studio of WGY in
Schenectady, six miles train the
developmental station, there
may be controlled a great
number of transmitters. one of
which is the ﬁrst supcr-powcr
transmitter in the world,
way, together with its associ-
ctrs, KOA or Denver and KGO

The World’s
Loudest Voice

0n the rolling plains of South Schenectady, in
several scattered buildings, is a vast laboratory for
studying radio broadcasting problems. Gathered
here are many kinds and sizes of transmitters from
the short- -wave and low- -power sets to the giant
super- power unit with a 50- to 250- kilowatt voice.

Super-power and simultaneous broadcasting on
several wave lengths from the same station are
among the startling later-day developments in
radio. And even with hundreds of broadcasting
stations daily on the air throughout the land, these
latest developments stand for still better service
to millions of listeners.

Only ﬁve years old, yet radio broadcasting has
developed from a laboratory experiment into a
mighty industry. And alert, keen young men have
reaped the rewards.

But history repeats itself. Other electrical develop-
ments will continue to appear. And it will be the
college man, with broad vision and trained mind,
who will be ready to serve and succeed.

run of Grinncll victories helm-e the

it might be said that Gl'lunell lost

the Pioneers would have had at least
a lead for the tirst quartcr.

Easy Time For Scorers

As it was, the ior-wards didirt for-
word and for the lirst six minutes the
scorers had a rest. Drake was the
ﬁrst to eriise the goose-eggs and put
up two irce throws, one by niontz and
the other by van Aiken, Grinnell was
next to score, getting two charity lass»
es by Mark,

the lirst basket of tho game. The
Pionccrs thc’n got busy and garnered
a free throw and duo of their two
haskcts. “Dopey" Lamb had the honor
or putting Grinncll in front tor the
lirst and lost time, the score being 5
to l in taror of the Pluueers. Everett
and Drake then got busy and worlc
ed the ball a little harder and were
rewarded by going to the showers wrth
and s to 5 lead.

within i'our minutes after the scc-
oiul liali' had started, Everett and Mr
crs had both scored and soon the score
was its to 5 in layer or the Blue. Thou
Moran grabbed the hall and drihblcd

through the Drake dertnse t'or aneusy‘

basket, the rest or their points coining ‘

thc Pioneers with one basket and tuo
