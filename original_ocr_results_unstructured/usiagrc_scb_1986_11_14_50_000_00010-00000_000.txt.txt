Season. Ends with Conquest

by Walter J. Maley

The Grinnell football team bounced back
from last week‘s loss on Saturday with an
exciting come from behind victory at 11»
linois College. The season ending win gives
the Pioneers a 2&5 record, the same as last
year and better than most Grinnell teams
in the last 10 years. This series has been
close in three of the last four years, with
Grinnell usually winning.

The team overcame a long drive, cold
cloudy weather, and an “unruly” Illinois
College partisan crowd in the game. The
first half saw most of the scoring, with
each team getting two touchdowns apiece.
Chris Knoepfle scored both of Grinnell’s
six pointers on a pair of one-yard runs. The
score at half was 1444, The third quarter
was a tentative struggle with both teams
feeling each other out and trying to gain
the upper. hand. However, the Pioneers
were not getting results so coach John
Martinek made a a change at quarterback,
inserting freshman Dave White into the
lineup in the fourth quarter: According to

sources at the game, “the offense seemed
to snap to attention and played with a
renewed intensity", The change apparent-
ly worked. Late in the fourth quarter White
threw a 39~yard touchdown pass to
sophomore Paul Manternach which gave
Grinnell the lead and eventually the game.
However, the game was not over. lllinois
College made a valiant effort to come back
and win the game. They moved the ball
down the field in the last two minutes but
ran out of time on the Grinnnell 11~yard

line, due to a mighty stand by the Pioneer _

defense.

There were several points of interest to
the game. Chris Knoepﬂe, injured last
week, broke 1000 yards for the season in
this game. Rumor has it he was aided by
the rugby boots of Rob Knowles. With the
injury to Fred Hopkins, the pioneers were
forced to play without half of the receivers
they had at the beginning of the year. Phil
Worth. defensive most valuable player for
the team, played at middle linebacker and
had two interceptions in the game. Tom

Monogue had his longest punt return of the
year in the game. Mike Grossman summe
ed up the game by saying “We came out
swinging and introduced the Blue Boys to
Pioneer Football". The injured Fred
Hopkins was heard to say, “I’ll be back
despite not being in the program or being a
captain Finally, junior Tim Northrop
captured the mood of the campus, I’m
sure, by saying ”nice game guys”.
Earlier this week, the team voted for
player awards and next year's captains.
The offensive MVP award was shared by
fullback Chris Knoepl'le and offensive
tackle Ray Backman As I said, Phil Wurth
was defensive MVP, Captains next year
will be seniors to be Mick Maclean and

Tom Monogue, and junior to be Phil
Worth. ‘

And now 1 would like to take this oppor-
tunity to present a couple of awards of my
own. The “We Never Get Press" award
goes to the offensive and defensive lines
who both had outstanding seasons. They
led the team in turnovers gained to tur-
novers lost ratio. The Chuck Blomquist
Award goes to Mark Martin. The Dave
Jones Memorial Good Guy Award goes, .
appropriately. to Dave dons. The Fifth
Year Senior Award goes to Scott Stauifer.
Finally, the Coach of The Year Award goes
to Andy Hamilton in a close race, Until
next year, that will about do it for Pioneer
Football. 1 hope you enjoyed seeing it as
much as I enjoyed bringing it to you.
