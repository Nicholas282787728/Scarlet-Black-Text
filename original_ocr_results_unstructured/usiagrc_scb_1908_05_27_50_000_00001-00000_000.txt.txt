The 11909 Cyclone Appears Mondny Al‘-
terntloni’l‘lle Production is an

The long expected on Crclone made
its appearance Monday nit’ noon and
from general opinion, the school were
swept away by its many commendable
features.

The hook lnllr ‘nlnlntaius the stand.
ard oi l‘orlller Bears and as usual rep-
resents a great amount of sacriﬁce and
personal work on the part of the
heard.

The on Cyclone is hound with a
hlack leather cm‘el" with a handsome
gold dies or the College seal anti name
or the book on the front cover. The
paper used is athigh grade. white en-
amel and this, with a good grade or
cuts, made very creditable halt-tone
reproductions,

Athletic receive prominent mention
and this is hot natural rrom a class
with the athletes ol note and inter»
class victories which the juniors have
won,

The cartoons were iairly good and
it is an open question whether boards
are justiﬁed in their expenditure along
this line.‘

Although devoid of any real literary
ehorts, yet the general tone of the
book is one that appeals most to the
students.

The book is dedicated to Protessor
Ryan and even this honor is hut a
slight recognition of his lahors in he.
halr of many college interests

The Cyclone was printed by the
Kenyan 00., or Des Moines, and the
engraving and grouping streets was
done by the Des Moines Engraving Co.

Taken as a whole the hook is well
worthy ol a place among the archives
of the college.

For the henellt or those who are
really ignorant as to the merits of
Grinnell's men in the tliilerent events
at state meet as uell as lor those who
cl-ztl'e n certain amount of athletic
iniormnt‘ion, new or otherwise, at this
time of year, a brief survey or the
dillorent events may not he entirely
out of order.

The ﬁrst event of the 'iueet proper
is the 100»yzlrd dash, and when the
tape has been hreasted Grlnuell sun-
porters conﬁdently expect to be some
to jot down eight points to our credit
with Hull ﬁrst and Turner second, ale
though on the strength or last years '
perrormance done gives Miller of Iowa
the second.

In the 220 Hunt again is invincible
and Turner is almost sure or second. '
Miller and Knowles of Acres will ﬁght
{or third.

With or without Hubbard. Flanagan
looks a sure winner in the 440, while
it either Hull in Turner run, Grinnell
IS almost assured of eight points, Ha—
znrd and Hammer or lowa are good
men lint their defeat at Wolf's hands
would he no surprise here.

But our chances in all the events
are not so rosy. In the distances we
can hope lor little because of the large

three excellent men in the state, any
