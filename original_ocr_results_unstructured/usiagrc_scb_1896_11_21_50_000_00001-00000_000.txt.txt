George Kennan’s Lecture.

Last evening in spite of the in-
clcment weather, a large audience
gathered at the Stone Chuich to
hear the ﬁrst lecture or this year's
v. M C A. course, delivered by
George Kennan, the noted Amel‘r
ican traveler in Siberia and Russia

Mr Kennan was well known to
his audience both on account of
his previous appearance here and
of his widespread popularity
through hisarticles in mt armory.

After a brief introduction by
Presidentﬁates. Mr. Keitnnii bcr
gan his lecture and held his audi-
ence to the best of attention for
nearly two hours
r Mr. Kennan has the quality es-
sential for a successful lecturer,
that of interspersing his remarks
with anecdotes or humorous pas
sages which bring into greater res
lief the oratorical efforts.

Probably the most
parts of the lecture were the nar-
ration of the search and discovery
of the ﬁve Américans, and the de-
scription of the Aurora Borealis,
which was the greatest display of‘
that kind known for ﬁfty years in
that country noted for its rEmﬂIks
able phenomena.

The facts concerning the lives
and customs of the Koraks were

thrilling

intensely interesting and very in-
structive. Theirpeculiar mariiage
customs and religious 0bsclv~

Iy described by the lecturer.

To students who have busied
themselves in the last few years
with the study of languages, and
who have begun to feel that with
a little effort they can master any
of the European languages, Mr.
Kennan's description or the Rtlsr
sia‘n “iargon” with its Seven~casc
nouns and numerous declensioiis
was a set-back to their belief in
their linguistic powcis.

Mr. Kennan has received high
praise wherever he has gone and
we bespcak tor him a wellrﬁlled
house should he ever again return
to Grinncll.

Lecture by Miss Rand.

which were built of boxes of tea
Tile view from the river from
which one can look far over into
Siberia she thought very ﬁne. The
ships in the river were ofall kinds
and one was loaded with convicts
waiting to be sent into exile.

The girls were very much
pleased and ivish to express their
hearty thanks.

1900 Defeats ’97.

The seniors and freshman lined
tip at Athletic Park Thursday at-
ternoon for the ﬁrst interrclass
football game of the season, and
the freshmen won by their suc»
cessful tiy at goal. igoo had the
advantage of a team, every man of
which has been in active practice
all season while the solemn seniors
numbered but three men in trains
ing. The superior work of the
senior backs. however. served to
make the game much closer and
more interesting than was antici»
pated.

The freshmen won the toss and
chose the north goal With the wind
ill their favor. Sargent kicked
off and the fray was on. After a
few plays which netted the fresh-
men a slight gain Sargent smashed
the interference, secured the ball
on a fumble and made a clean run

'98 Basket Ball.‘

Tlieie have been strange rtiinois,
ﬂoating through the air that the
iboys in the class of '98 were not
‘imbued with the proper athletic
spirit. The girls of that class re-
sented this slight upon their class
honor and to prove that it was
without foundation, challenged
the boys of the class to a game of
basket ball. The game was played
ithis morning in the Armory and
resulted in a Victory for the boys
by a score of 59 to 32.

The boys excelled largely in
goal throwing but the girls played
the better team work. Armstrong.
Beyer and McLaren threw many
brilliant goals. Marsh played an
exceptionally ﬁne center. his
height aiding his side materially.

Misses Nollen, Wyland, Mc-
Ewen and Whitman were always
where the ball was and played to-
gether like veterans.

The score or the girls was made
for the most part on fouls by their
opponents The ﬁlial score wasl
Boys, 59: Girls. 32.
