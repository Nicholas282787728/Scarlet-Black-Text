Defeat Langan, ‘Dibble
in Diamondball

Rawson and Gates won dine
mondhall games from Laugan
and Dibble respectively yesterday
afternoon. Rawson heat Langan
by a score of 10’s in a hall game
that featured 15 er rs, and Gates
won a hectic struggle from Dibr
ble, 14e1o. On Monday Clarh
trimmed Rawson 9-4 while Gates
and Smith battled in an unfinish-
ed game that was stopped at 6,

A four run rally that broke a
are tie in the first half of the
seventh inning was staged by
Raw-son for its first victory of
the season yesterday. The fine
relief hurling by Leroy Petersen
who replaced Heinemeun in the
fourth frame after he had given
up three of Langan's four hits
and all their runs, was the most
important part in the victory In
the second inning the Rawson
defense went to pieces‘, and Lang—
an pushed over four runs without
the aid of a really solid hit.

Gates Delenrs Dibble.

Gates Won over Dibble in a
free hitting game by scoring 11
runs in the first three stanzas,
Bmver holding the northenders to
seven scores in the same period.
Bower walked six men and whif—
fed seven; Rodemeyer, pitching
for Dibble, walked four and fan-
ned four.

Rawson and Clark started out
to play a tight ball game with
Heinemann and Bauer hooking up
in a dual on Monday afternoon
but in the fifth frame the former
weakened, and before Petersen
could come to the rescue five
runs scored. Bauer held Kelly
men to three hits, Clark made
11 safe smashes.

Dispute Arises,

With the scare '14-10 in favor
of Smith going into the last half
of the seventh, at 6 o'clock Mon-
day an argument ensued about
whether or not to play the ball
game out, or to reven’ the score
to the last full inning, namely
the sixth.

At a. meeting of the intramural
board yesterday afternoon. it
was decided to replay the last
two and one half innings at the
end of the season. This game
will be played after May 15, ac-
cording to James Clynch, intra-

mural manager.
All games from today on will
be reverted to the last full inning
completed if the game is not over
at 5. he added. The hoard voted
to allow a maximum of 10 min-
utes for a team to appear on the
ball field ready to play after the
starting time of the game,

Princeton Professors Hurt
.as Radium Tube Explodes

Princeton. N. J. (ACP)7Two
Princeton professors were burned,
and $4,000 worth of radium was
scattered in minute particles
thmughout a laboratory here when
a test tube mysteriously exploded.

Determined efforts to recover
[the invisible particles from the
walls, floors and ceiling of the
laboratory are being made, and
the two experimenters, members
of the Princeton physics depart
ment, will undergo extensive tests
in order to determine the passibllir
ty of their having contracted the
incurable radium poisoning.

Reason for the explosion of the
radium. which was mixed with
five grams of beryllium, is un-
known.
