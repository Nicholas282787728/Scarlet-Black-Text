Goodwin’s Music
Has Character in
Program Friday

By H. ‘V. RIATLACK

Any single one of the Six or eight
numbers on Prof. Hugo Goodwin's
program Friday would have been
worth going to Herrick chapel to

the opening group gave this recital a
character, quite its own, which pre<

famous for his deadly passing and
kicking.

All of the Pioneers‘ opponents have

planned their games with one inten--

tiun, to Stop Ruff. Sometimes they
did, but usually it was Ruff who was
responsible for Grinnell victories.

Not only could Ruff pass and kick,»

but his ball toting has made him a
man to be feared, ,

Ben Hensley has been one of those
players who, while not of the speed

his part in every game. a hardhite

when a first down was needed, and
