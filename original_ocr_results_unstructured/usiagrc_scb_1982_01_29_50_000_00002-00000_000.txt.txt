Rush Med School cancels Grinnell program

Financial reasons cited as culprit in termination

by Anne Rawland

After seven years oi cooperative opera
tion officials from Rush Medical College in
Chicago announced Wednesday the phasA
ing out of the Grinnell-Rush Medical
Studies Program iGRMSt by the end oi
the 1983-84 academic year,

Begun in 1974, the program permits
students to take the first year of medical
school at Grinnell and the additional three
at Rush in Chicago, Each year 16 students
participate in the program To date about
30 Grinnell undergraduates have enrolled.
Of these, none have failed to complete
their education,

The officials from Rush cited "Strictly
financial" reasons [or the phaserout. They
explained that the program was started
when Rush Medical College lacked the
physical facilities to offer all of its students
a full four»year curriculum In fact, Rush
started programs at both Grinnell and
Knox College in Galesburg, 111., as partoi
an effort to resuscitate the Rush Medical
College. which had become inactive in
1942.

Since that time. Bush's development
program has upgraded facilities and the
program with Grinnell is now more expen-
sive than a home-based, full four»year
operation. Although the future of Knox's

program is uncertain, Executive Vice-
President Waldo S. Walker indicated Rush
would probably terminate the Knox opera-
tion as well.

According to William Deminoff, director
of College Relations.the GRMS offered
firstryear students excellent prepar tion
for Hieir subsequent medical training.
Throughout the years, participants in
GEMS have scored as well on national exs
ams as students who start at a bigcity
medical center,

Demlnoff also noted Grinnell will con-
tinue to maintain formal educational rela»
tionships with Rush in nursing, medical
technology and graduate offerings on
basic sciences.

Under die current Grinnelerush agree
ment Rush supplies lunding for instructors
while Grinnell furnishes facilities and
equipment Consequenﬂy. Grinnell will re
tain the latter but the fate of the three
GRMS professors is undecided.

According to Walker no plans presently
exist for incoporating the professors into
the college's curriculum. But. he said, if
positions are available they'll certainly be
among those considered,

Walker also offered the college's
remorse over the termination. The

medical studies curriculum “has added a
valuable educational dimension to the
general academic program here.” he said.
“We’re sorry to see it go."

Affected by the Rush announcement are
Associate Prniessors of Biology John Den
bo and John Martinek as well as Assistant
Professor of Biology Bruce Voyles. All
three conveyed their regret when asked
about Rush's announcement.

stone Professor of Biology and Director
of the Rush Medical Studies Program lrv-
lng Fishman said the biology department
will recommend to the administration a
plan for revising Grinnell's curriculum
after the departure of GRMS. He also
hopes to incorporate one or more of the
displaced professors. None of the pros
fessors commented on tuture plans but
Voyles said, “id like to slay.”

Fishman joined in lamenting the loss of
the program. “We're sorry that Rush finds
it necessary to cancel," he Said. “it's too
bad that money still talks."

When asked about the affect of Bush‘s
withdrawal on Grinnell's undergraduate
curriculum Fishman replied, “It will have
an affect but not a devistating affect."
Although undergraduates may enroll in a
few of the GEMS Courses Fishman noted.

Rosenfield Program. hopes that "this
symposium will raise the kinds at issues
that our nation must consrder in
establishing new priorities and reassess»

ing its values as a democratic nation in the
late twentieth century." He said the sym-
posium "could be one contributing factor
in helping to stimulate a national discourse
on the form, substance, value and proper
regulatory control of higher education that
will go beyond the present all-absorbing
budgetary concerns of the federal and
state governments.”

ticipate,” He went on to say the college of-
fers most of the courses at an
undergraduate level anyway.

Fishman did note the negative affect on
Gn'nnell‘s prestige. “Grinnell and Knox
are the only private Liberal Arts colleges
with such a program." he said. However.
Flshman does not predict a decline in ape
plications because of the change. ”NO one
knows how many students come because
of the program.” he said.

Valgemae, three first-year‘medical
students who attended Grinnell as
undergrads. substantially agree wtth

pact will be on medical education. "it's
great to walk into a class of 16 people
where you can talk to your professors oasis

Burling renovation started over break

In a letter sent out earlier this week
Christopher McKee, librarian of the coin
lege, explained to the members of the cam»
pus community why they might be incove-
nienced or disturbed by construction on
Burllng Library Work on the penthouse
addition to the library was started a few
days into the new year and will continue
throughout the semester. McKee doesn't
anticipate many problems for students
trying to study in the library although he
does admit that there will be "occasionally
troubling times" during the semester,

Construction at the penthouse is not
scheduled for completion until May 24, just
after iinals Mckee said that most of the
work will be done outside of the existing
building The majority of noisy work is
taken care of early in the morning before
most students use the library. and work in
side ‘he building is usually not very noisy.

On Monday there were dennite problems
with the noise because of the use of a
jackhammer to remove several large
beams from the elevator shaft. Students
found it very difficult. if not impossible. to

study. McKee, however, said that there
should not be any more excessive noise
and the construction people are being very
considerate by starting work before 6 am
and finishing in the early afternoon before
many people use the library The elevator
problem, he said, resulted when the
elevator contractor was unable to do the
work over break.

The Loomis Brothers Company, contrac-
tor for the project, is accustomed to doing
construction in less than ideal conditions,
They have done work on several Heree
stores and are aware of the problems that
people face because of construction going
on around them Dust screens and signs
were put up near the construction sites in
side the building and major inconve»
niences during the construction process
should be short lived.

The work on the penthouse has to be
done now, Mckee said, so there will be
space to store the hooks over the summer
while the present three floors are being
renvovated, If everything goes according
to the schedule, the library should have all

five floors ready to be used on or around
Labor Day, Book capacity and study space
will double because of the addition and
there will be more facilities for computer
terminals and Microfilm storage,

The construction budget was approved
at $3.3 million and McKee said that it ap
pears that the iigure will be met. The ex
pansion comes after several years of
discussion concerning the library. in 0c-
tobci- of 1951. a revised plan in the expan-
sion was submitted to the Board of
Trustees and approved. The Board gave
final approval to begin planning the cons
struction in the spring of 1930. The college
then set out to begin raising funds to meet
the costs for the library addition. The
library has 5235.000 budgeted for purchasA
mg new materials for the library to help
fill up some of the new space in the
building McKee said there would pro-
bably not be any need to expand on the
renovated building for at least 25 years.
Burling is about 25 years old and has not
had any major structural renovations until
now.
