SGA'S final budget for the 1976-77
school year will be voted on
Wednesday night by Joint Board.
Lasthdnesday night, the Finance
Committee presented its proposed
tigures for next year. The Com~

mlttee received requests for
330,000 more than its expected
income. Thus it made cuts in the
requests of every interest group.

Interspersed with the haggling
about specific figures, a raise in
activities fees and funding
priorities have been discussed in
the past two weeks. A raise in this

, year's activities fee would have
=mproved the budgeting situation
considerably and is an area that
Warren Eastman, among others,

'ould like to see discussed for
ffuture years. At the Wednesday
night meeting, son President Will
Collins pointed out that any in-
crease in the activity fee would
have to be a decision of the Board
of Trustees.

A brief discussion about
priorities ensued Wednesday after
Finance Committee members
reaffirmed their refusal to allocate
iunds for sound system
replacements and improvements
in ARH. Steve Kristal, Cowles
representative, questioned
)vhether SGA should be required to
provide any money tor that area.
“I think we should give serious
‘ thought to What we should and
shouldn‘t be funding,” he com-
‘ ented. Administrative funding of
New Student Days entertainment,
KDIC and the S8413 was also

, discussed.

action has been taken.

The week after spring recess

' Sam and a friend from out of town

were returning from the Longhorn
when a pick-up truck and a car
pulled up beside them. Five youths
circled them and began to verbally
harass them and knock them down
to the ground. The incident was
reported to the police by two
witnesses. The police were unable
to act because they lacked a
complaint by the victims. Sam said
he didn't file because it didn’t seem
to matter at the time.

The three cases above are just
some of the growing number oi
incidents of harassment of college
students by “townies.” Since the
beginning of the school year, most
of the cases have been ones of
verbal harassment by persons
riding in passing cars and trucks.
However. Since about March 13,
there has been a growing number
of physical assaults, in fact, in the
past week, assaults have resulted
in bodily injuries, But victims still

sparsely attended by students not
involved in a group requesting
money.

Total requests by the Student
Publications and Radio Com-
mittee, representing all the media,
were cut $3,541 by the Finance
Committee. The 3800 cut in the 5&3
budget will mean that next year 20
fewer pages will be printed than
were this year.

According to KDIC represenr
tatlves, the $1760 cut in their
request will greatly jeopardize
their chances of getting their
license renewed by the FCC next
year. “Currently all 10-watt
stations are under attack. There is
a move in the FCC to phase them
out," explained Steve Hirtle, this
year's station manager. “The FCC
requires that any radio station be
communityoriented. especially 10»
watt ones , . . Unless we have the
iunds to be able to go out and work
in the community, we’re in danger
of losing our license."

Substantial cuts in the Social
events budget were made by the
Finance Committee. Social
chairpersons claim that their Costs

costs for major concerts have

Wednesday night, Smith said the
cost of jazz concerts has also gone
up. “Folk is the only area that‘s

mented Meltzer said that the

have not pressed charges, fearing .

retaliation if they report the in»
cidents to the police.

Contrary to popular heliers, most
of the attacks have not been by
gangs of high school students, but
by postrhigh school students who

work during the day and cruise the
streets at night. Furthermore

Chief Peters, of the Grinnell Police
Department, is iairly sure about
who the attackers are. Lacking
positive identification by the
victims, he has been unable to do
anything. Tederman said, ”To
a certain extent the police‘s hands
are tied when students are
hesitant, somewhat un-
derstandably so, to go down to the
police station to press chargos.”
He feels that until the attackers
can be ”nailed legally” there isn’t
much to be done.

The reluctance to report in-
cidents to Student Affairs also
occurs. Two weeks before spring
break, Tederman said, he sent out
a campus memo discussing the
increased harassment of students
downtown and asked for reports of

they gave it to us, because i know
how tightthings are.”She said that
at the proposed lunding level either
the quantity or the quality of next
year’s films will go down,

SGA Treasurer Mark Nissen had
originally proposed a $12,075 ad-
ministration budget, However,
salaries were cut or kept at this
year’s levels, travel expenses to
conferences were cut, and general
expenses were kept to a minimum,
enabling the Finance Committee to
propose $5,935 for next year’s
administra, ,ve purposes.

Financi' “ommittee members
have chopped the Public Events
budget by $1,750. A $7,501) level of
funding, even bolstered with
money from the administration
and the theatre department. ac
cording to Don Smith, Public
Events chairperson, will barely be
adequate to iund three events for
next year. This year, the Public
Events Committee sponsored
performances by the Manhattan
Project. Lhamo Tibetan Folk
Opera and I Musica di Roma
Chamber Orchestra.

Wednesday night, this year’s
initiative Fund chairman Mark
Frankel said, “In lieu of the Cuts
in hall funds, general budget and
informal events, it ($5.015 to the
Initiative Fund) is not enough, but
What can you do’” There was no
answer, only laughter,

General Budget is also

any of these acts, but he received
only two or three responses. He
attributes this reluctance to
Students’ fear of retaliations and
also the natural reluctance of
studenm to turn anyone into the
police,

Chief Peters emphasized,
however, that this reluctance is not
just a phenomenon that occurs only
with the college students, but also
with residents in town. Never
theless, Peters feels that crime
prevention is a tworway Street and
that his small force cannot handle
all the problems without the
cooperation of the community, He
said it is discouraging when his
men follow up on complaints and
determine the source of the
trouble, and nothing comes of the
work when the victim will not do
his or her part by making a
positive identiﬁcation

Finally, a meeting was held
Wednesday night between student
victims of attacks and Chief Peters
and Don Schilds, county attorney.
Also present were Waldo Walker.
dean of the college, and Tederman.

The main points coming out of the
meeting were that Peters needs the
help of the victim to identify the
suspect and that victims desire
arrests to be made, but without
having to get personally involved.

One major hurdle was probably
conquered at the meeting ‘when
Peters and Schild said that
retaliations rarely occur when a
victim brings a suspect to court
because of the possibility of en-
dangering one's defense when
appearing as a suspect.

The meeting ended wiﬁi Walker,
Tederman, Schilds, and Peters
emphasizing that as long as these
abuses are allowed to continue
unchecked they will not end. The
check can only happen it the
student victims are Willing to get
themselves involved by making
full reporo to the police and
making positive identifications of
suspects, Peters and Schilds
stressed.

Bonnie Rcdlich, movie chair-

docs not think the money that the
Finance Committee allocated to

movies is enough, However, she

or student enrollment above the estimate, that income should be
divided among the following areas as stated:

I. General Budget, 50 per cent of incomes unIiI others are filled
then 100 per cent. .

2. Initiative Fund, l5 per cent to a maximum of 3500 additional.
3. Hall Funds loa maximum of50 cents more each semester.

lerest group can easily justify the
request for money that they have
made, The Finance Committee

proposal requests last week and

substantially lower. At Finance
Committee budget hearings,
concern has been expressed about
the low level of the proposed lunds
for Initiative Fund and General

Budget.
