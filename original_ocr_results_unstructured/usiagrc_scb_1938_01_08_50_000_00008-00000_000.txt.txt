Young women who entered the
school for the first time this fall
were given four tests arranged to
make them view their own attribv
notes and consult their own ex-
penences,

Two of the tests have been used
since 1932: two were given for
the first time this fall. Following
are some of the controversial
statements and questions, trom
the alternatives of which the stu-
dents are asked to indicate a per-

of the tests:

“Because of the aggressive and
self-assertive nature of man the
abolition of war is an illusory
ideal. Yes. No.

Reading Abili’ry
Lessens Each Year

MINNEAPOLIS, Minnr7(ACP)
~College students can’t read as
rapidly nor as comprehenswely as
seniors in high school, but scien-
tific study has round an easy way
for them to learn, according to
Dr. Gilbert Wrenn of the Univerv

lege.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 8, 1938

Six years ago Dr. Wrenn start-
ed his experiments at Stanford by
introducing a course in rapid
reading. studies showed that one-
fifth of the Stanford freshmen
needed this course, and as the
students progressed in college,
the percentage of students who
could not read rapidly and com.
prehensively increased.

This year the general
has introduced a series of reading

dencies toward developed nourO- sity of Minnesota’s general col- terests of students, their ability

and their vocabulary.

Dr. Wrenn works with the stu—
dents on their homework or oth-
er study material instead of mere-

ly lecturing to them on ”how to
study." Each student must begin

reading the subheadings in the
chapter before he can start to
study the chapter itself.

“In this way ' he said, "the stu-
dent can anticipate the meaning
of the chapter. He will be able to'
understand more about what he
is reading than if he just ignored
the. subheadings."
