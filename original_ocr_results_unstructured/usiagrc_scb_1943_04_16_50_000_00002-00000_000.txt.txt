Contidentially, lt Smells - -

Another session of repulsiveness is
ALMOST over. The situation cannot be
corrected, we hope, more than once this
year. To what do we refer? The most
obnoxious smell in the hot water and the
steam coming to the college from the
Iowa Southern Utility company We had
all hoped spring would be here by nowi
and with it novodor water. The weather
man sabotaged us, and as a result, the
water is staiting to smell again,

Let’s look at history. Ever since the
college has been buying steam from the
I. S. U in 1931, all recipients of the
steam, and the hot water condensed from
it, have undergone physical and mental
nausea at least twice a year—fall and
springiwhen the thaws come out Arbor
Lake way. The I. S. U. buys their water
from the Grinnell Water Company for
conversion to steam. This water is softer

than Gl'innell cit' water—which loads up
boiler coils. as ally tou-nsperson can tess
tify. But, the Arbor Lake water has a
vegetable gas in it \iliicll produces the
effect with which we are all familiar. This
intensely sickening smell forces students
to leave radiators turned off in cold
weather rather than endure to smell it,
forces Grilluellians to take cold showers
rather than hot for fear of smelling like
the hot water. These conditions are un-
necessary. Certainly the college should
talie the matter up with the I. S. U. for
no other reasongas if student health and
morale was not enougllitliou the very
poor showing it gives to guests of the
college who are around when the dis
comfort is present.

What is the solution? r"‘hei‘e are two
alternatives. First, the I. S. U. could fu1<
fill their pledge to turn on Grinnell city
water when the smell is about to ape
pear. After the ”danger" is over, revert
to Arbor Lake water, This would cost
money surely, but it’s worth it. Secondly,
and by far the best solution, is for the
I. S. U. to purchase or make a filter
which would eliminate the horrible odori
This gadget would cost from one to may-
be three thousand dollars. But, accord-
ing to all utilities advertisements, the
aim of public service companies is to sat-
isfy the needs and desires of their cus—
tomers. Now, why can’t the I. S. U. ex-
pend a little capital to make their ser-
vices acceptable. After all, they exist for
their customers, not vice versa. To whom
do we make these recommendations? We
charge Mr. Paul Meyers, who has a con—
trolling voice in Arbor Lake (he owns it),
the Grinnell Water Company, the Iowa
Southern Utility Grinnell office, and Grill-
nell College maintenance department wih
the responsibility of satisfying the users
of his products, and with doing something
distinctly beneficial to the future of Grin-
nell College.
