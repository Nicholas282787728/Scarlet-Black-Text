Construction continues nearly on
schedule as workers approach completion
of the roof and exterior of the penthouse
addition to Burling Library. Librarian of
the College Christopher McKee said that
work on the project is about a week behind
in "real time."

when workers conclude the current job
of rooting the penthouse, they will place
glass in the windows. Next will come
finishing work inside. “We're absolutely
certain, barring some unforseen event,
that the penthouse will be finished by early
June, except for the multitler stack,"
stated McKee. The elevator is expected to
be installed by this time as well.

The loudest work is the wreckout which
is now going on as old material is being
torn out or the ceiling and walls in prepara-
tion for the new construction work which
will be done during the Summer and fall.
The wreckout should be completed next

a

New professors hired in economics,

semester when students return; crews
may work alter the library closes at night
on some or the high volume wreckout
towards the end of the semester so as to
keep the noise down during finals.

in August, returning students will find
construction crews ﬁnishing work on the
first and second floors, McKee targeted
Labor Day as the date those floors should
be done with the possible exception of
some finishing work. Construction will
continue on the basement through August,
Crews are expecting Thanksgiving m be
the date of completion for the whole proa
ject. There may be finishing work going on
after then, however.

As to the appearance oi Burling with the
new penthouse addition. McKee coma
menwd, “It couldn't be perfect but I think
it is a highly imaginative solution to an ex
tremely difficult architectural problem “
