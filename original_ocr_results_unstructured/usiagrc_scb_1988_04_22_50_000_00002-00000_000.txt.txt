end. We also raised concerns about
the amount or money that our
government sends to the Contras,
which is helping to destroy lives,
instead oi using the money to save
lives, such as through AiDs
research.

We were ﬂanked by over 100
policemen decked out in riot»
control gear — helmets. guns,
sticks 7 the works! There were
some on motorcycles for additional
torce, Although our demonstration
ended peaceiully, there were
earlier demonstrations at the
Federal Building where hundreds
were arrested and beaten by
police This created an atmosphere
of tension and concern in our
march

When we reached Haiglit Street,
a high seemed to take over the
crowd We were thrown back 20
years to days of the anti-Vietnam
demonstrations That was a time
and place revolving around peace
marches, hippies, rock bands,
psychedelic drugs, ilower
children, and iree love. We were
only a small reminder of our
predecessors, but we were rallying
tor the same thing: peace, As long
as people still want peace. it may
one day become a reality That is
the real reason we were marching,

signatures to be made official

Speaking oi ARll, Building Com

request irom her to Benjamin
Weese, the architect tor the new
ARH, concerning the historical
aspects oi the building, and the
other was his reply, Anyone in-
terested in this matter should see
his or her senator tor a copy. Also,
the trees on Central Campus will
not be chopped down, just trimmed
a little higher oi their branches.
No architects have been cone

posals for the student building, and
these should be ready next tall.
