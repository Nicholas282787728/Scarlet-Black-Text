WTF is up with all the “gnasty’.' gnats?

lsv ELIZABETH PEARCE

The recent puzzling infestation of gnats on campus has
caused annoyance for nearly anyone hoping to make their way
across Mac field, Cleveland beachhor basically anywhere;
'without ﬁnding themselves covered in small,

, moving insects.

The seemingly sudden onset of the gnats,
which have thoroughly taken over all outdoor arr
eas,residence halls and the dining hall dish room,
has led many to askimore out of desperation
than curiosity—WTF is up with the gnatsl?

1. Lyle s, AKAThe campus Pub

You've probably got a lot of face-to-face catching up to
do. Albeit unconventional, you could always take your parents
down to ourvery own Lyle's Pub. Nothing says,“Ma, Dad, it's
good to see ya," like mozzarella sticks, a 312 and some chalkr
board tic-tac-toe.

2. Molecules that Matter

Ifyour parents are looking to get a glimpse of the academic
buildings and to get a feel for the college, take them over to
the Molecules that Matter exhibit at the Faulconer Gallery in
Bucksbaum and knock out two birds with one stone. The ex-
hibit takes an utﬂscience interdisciplinary approach to looking
at molecules and their strucnire, function and often unexpected
beauty This weekend, the gallery is open Thursday and Friday
in pan, and Saturday and Sunday 12-5 p.m.

If your parents decidc that molecules really really matter,
there is also a gallery talk given by Noyce’s visiting scholar, llia
Guzel, titled “XrRay Visions of Aspit' , A Penetrating Look
at the wonder Drug," Friday evening at 5 pm.

SlThe Farmer’s Market

Let’s not lie to oursclves,Lonnsk‘r's and Comeback Cafe are
fantastic, but ifyou'ie looking to avoid crowds this weekend, a
nice alternative might be a picnic in the park. Weather permitr
ring, you could take your folks to Saturday’s farmer’s market in
town to pack a picnic and experience the fruits oflowa's labor.
You don't have to walk far to grab a spot on the grass, Vendors
set up along 4th Avenue, alongside central Park.

from a run, I’ll find bugs sticking to all parts of m-
my face and in my eyes," sara Galenbeck’lS said.

For students who ride their bikes, the gnat
problem is even more dire, as they are blinded and choked by
endless clouds of minjscule bugs, sometimes leading to gnat-
induced accidents. “Bike with your mouth closed," Sam Peters
son Y11 said.

Scientiﬁcally, the gnats most likely appeared in such great
number because of the recent rains. Gnats breed in wet or soggy
organic material, thus making'a damp Mac field and the soon
tesbescomposted mush in the dish room gnat heaven.

Peterson is one offew students who takes pleas
sure in the addition of gnats to campus. “Some-
times when I’m bored in class, one will land on my
arm and I’ll watch the little 'guy crawl around over
my arm hairs,"he said. “They're actually sort ofin—
teresting. They have a greenish hue ifyou look at
them closely and they're sort of metallic. They're
Cute."-

With October winds blowing in, the goats are
not likely to stick around for much longer, much
to the joy ofrnost ofus. Speaking from experience,
however, Peterson warns that the bugs will most likely return
next year. “As far as I can recall, it’s pretty much a perennial
thing," he said.“Sotry for the bad news."

Although it's a bit of: hike on foot, a couple ofbikes or a
short car ride could bring you and the fam to Arbor Lake, a
scenic little spot offofWest Street and Marvin Avenue, There
is a path that circles the lake, perfect for a short.bike ride or a
stroll, While this is obviously a suggestion for something to do
with the parents this weekend,Arbor Lake is also a spot to keep
in mind for after they're gone. It’s great for getting an outdoor
