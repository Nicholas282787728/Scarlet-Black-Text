DRAFT CEILING IS 75

The Selective Service System recently announced that the draft lottery
ceiling will remain at Random Sequence Number ’15 in orderto meet
the September call of 4,800 men. Lottery number 75 was announced
earlier as the ceiling for August inductions
Acting Dralt Director Byron v. Pepitone expelained that sufficient
numbers of men to meet the September call will be available in the mans
power pool at lottery number '75 and below. These are men who will
become fully available following the issuance of orders for August inc
ductions, September's inductions will bring the total of men inducted
into the Army in 1972 to 36.000.

NEW DRAFTALTERNATIVE

The Selective Service System this summer effected a major policy
change which will permit men scheduled for induction after July 1 to
enlist or be appointed in the National Guard or Reserves after receipt
of their induction orders. The Regulation change also will permit men
who receive induction orders tojoin Regular branches of the Amed Forces
for a minimum of two years active duty, if such programs are offered.
The new policy does not affect men with June reporting dates.

The result of discussions between the Department of Defense and the
Selective Service System, the new policy is expected to stimulate rec
cruiting for the National Guard and the Reserve forces. The Guard and
Reserve forces are estimated to be 40,000 men below their authoriied
strength, and both secretary of Defense Melvin Lairdand Deputy Secretary
of Defense Kenneth Rush have recently expressed concern overthis
situation.

The only option open to men who had received induction orders in past
months was to join one of the Regular branches of the service for at least
three years active duty. No Guard or Reserve enlistments or appoint,
ments were authorized after the mailing of induction Orders.

The new policy requires that men complete enlistment or appointment
processing in the Guard, Reserves, or Regular forces at least 10 days
prior to their scheduled induction dates. All registrants are given 30
days’ notice of induction, so men who receive induction orders after
July 1 will have 20 days to effect enlistments or appointments.

Men who receive induction orders and desire to enter in the Guard
or Reserve must locate unit Vacancies on their own. They should request
that their enlistmenls or appointments be expedited in order to meet the
today requirement. Enlistments or appointments in the Guard or Re-
serves require at least 4 months active duty for training and the balance
of six years participating in.the Ready Reserve. Such enlistments or ap—
pointments do not reduce the obligation of the Selective Service System
to provide requested numbers of inductees to the Army.

BURLING BLACKOUT

Sporadic power failues, which
have been plaguing the College
throughout the week, have been
caused by a break in the pris
mary feeder from the college
power substation to Eurling Li»
brary.

Physical Plant Director Dale
Hawn blames the break on the
exceptionally wet summer in
Grinnell. An abnormally high
water table caused a Splice in

this feeder cable to breakdown,
creating a short circuit which
in turn caused the rest of the
campus to go dark

Temporary power lines will
provide current for Burling Li—
brary through this afternoon.
Both Burling and the Fine Arts
Center will have power cut off
after classes Friday, and will
remain Without power until
Sunday afternoon,

RA Heidner Seeks Students

by Elaine Carey

A middleeofsthe-road Women’s
Liberationist, a McGovernlte, and an
ecologically minded counselor is
Suzanne Heidner, resident adviser
for Main, Mears, and Cleveland
Halls and the Conoco Cooperative.

Ms. Heidner is originally from a
small town outside of Milwaukee,
Wis. Asa math major, she completed
her undergraduate work at the Wis-
consin State University at White-
water. A junior high school teachr
ing 10b at Lake Mills, Wis. followed
her college years. She found the per-
sonal Contact with her students there
to be more to her liking than the
classroom. As aresult, sheattended
the University of Wisconsin atMads
ison to do graduate work inguldance
and counseling.

Her primary interest in 1970 was
focused upon higher education
counseling. She accepted a posi-
tion as a residence hall and coun-
seling center adviser at Wisconsin
State University at Whitewater. She
believes that this type of position
as a counselor creates more aware
ness on the Counselor's part as to
the interaction of students,

The decision to seek a new school
and another counseling position was
threefold. Ms Heidner had had two
years of counseling experience in
a large public institution andwished
to obtain the same position at a
small private school in order to
compare the two, Second, 3 rec

SummerfesiL Reviv

by Curt correll

With the people's festival of of
music/life at Yasgur‘s farm in 1969,
the birth of a ~Woodstock Nation”
was proclaimed, Thereafter —The
Rock Festival", stereotyped (not
necessarily inaccurately) as agath-
ering of freaks with lots
of wild music, sex, and drugs, prtr
liferated nationwide.

But then there also evolved anti—
pathetic reactions among local resi»
dents in rock lest areas, legal re—
strictions directed at the tests, and
a tightning of promotional money,
The Rock Festival was diagnosed as
dying. With Altamount it was pro-
nounced dead,

But is it! Can one discount the
30,000 youths who splashed their
way to Puerto Rico’s Marv Sol fes-
ing of longhairs lured by prospects
tival last spring (SsB;‘April 14,
1972; reprints available), or ignore
the 200,000 who jammed interstate
highways bumper to bumper from
New York City to Pennsylvania for
Mt. Pocono's music fest held in
July! And, if The Rock Festival is
dead, what, then, were all those
people doing in Milwaukee for Sum—
merfest '72--that’s right, Milwau
kee, Wisconsin, of all place, host-e
ing a summerfestival lasting ten
days and nights, A focus on Sum-
merfest '72 will show that the
Rock Festival, so recently laid to
rest, has engineered a comeback,
conquering now even the heartland

duction of the counseling program at
Whitewater encouraged herto move.
Third, she commented that a new
environment stimulatesapersonand
that that person brings new ideas
to the new environment.

Grinnell became her choice after
a visit to the campus. She now feels
very comfortable on the campus,
She attributes this comfort to the
kind, warm, open atmosphere
created by the student body and the
administration.

As this is the first time Ms, Heid-
ner has been on a small campus,
she stated that She will be able to
know people more personally,
Whereas before at Whitewater she
had 1100 students, now she has ape
proximately 190 at Grinnell.

As a resident adviser, she aims
at facilitating the living and aca»
demic adjustments and pressures
that students experience. Her job,
she said, can be as different as
every student. With some students
her responsibility perhaps would
be finding a key, while others need
someone to rap with.

Equality for women as far as pay,
performance, skills, and desires
is Ms. Heldner's view on Women's
Liberation. AS a middlecloe-
roader, she approves the acceptance
of all groups Such as the gays and
the lesbians. She commented that the
difference between men and women
cannot be ignored as the neuter sex
doesn’t exist. She also believes that

performances,

The festival is publicly billed as
a family affair. Surprisingly, this
is, to a certain extent, an accurate
description. Events of ’72 such as
Grandparents Day and performers
such as Dionne Warwicke, Glen
Campbell, and Aretha Franklin,
were not strictly youth-oriented in
their appeal. Nonetheless, youth
flavored much of Summerfest ”72’s
activities. There was Blues Night,
Folk Night, Rook Revival Night;
featured guests included Edgar Wine
ter, J. Geila. Jerry Lee Lewis,
Arlo Guthrie, and Brewer and Sh-
ippeley.' And the Rock Spectacular
finale was marked strictlv for vouth;

Orchestra, plus several more.

This sounds much like a festival
Nirvana. But Summerfest isn't; the
ere are many criticisms which the
local media and sponsors tend to
skip over, Facilities at Summer
fest are still lacking in several
aspects, and an important addition
would be the provision Of camping/
sleeping areas for out of town or
state youths.

Summerfest publicists try too hard
to make their show sound good.
Media coverage this year, par
ticularly in newspapers, reflected
a bias toward totals s totals of
people, totals on money gathered
in, and at the height of this folly,
the totals of out of state license
plates counted on Summerfest
parking lots. Such coverage often
came at the expense of an ex—
amination of the quality of Sums
merfest events, which would have
allowed the festival to speak for
itself.

And finally, most notorious, and
most ridiculous, was the bust ef-
fected upon comedian George Car-i
lin for his use of obscenity on
stage. The general official re-
action was to play things down.
The general youth reaction was
to ask Milwaukee to grow up.
it is an event such as this, coupe
led with the Mary Sol‘s and Mt.
Pocono’s, which is keeping The
Rock Festival not just alive, but
thriving.

 

Coaches Grant St. Olaf,
Monmouth Number One Spot

Edd Bowers, according to a Mid-
west Conference news release,
agrees with many of the other Mills
west Conference coaches and plans
to rely heavily on the new fresh-
men eligibility rule, starting at least
five of the ten freshmen out for
the squad Adding this new talent
on to his veterans, particularly
quarterback Jeff Dick, running back
Washington Allton and tackle Barry
lluff, Bowers will hope to overcome
the lack of a preseason ranking.

Monmouth and St, Olaf, conference
champions last year, were chosenby
the conference coaches as the 1972
favorites, with Ripon claiming the
conference’s third spot. Cornell,
Cde, Knox and Lawrence were
chosen as contenders for the re-
maining first division places.

Most of the squads, but particu-
larlv St Olaf. will be doing some
hard looking for replacements of

strong members of last year’s succ
cessful teams. With Ole Gunderson,
Little All—American tailback, not
in the lineup, St. Olaf’s offense
may see some changes, but their
defense will Center around another
potential AlleAmerican, Z25-p0und
defensive end Art Hultgren.

Monmouth, although losing six All-
conference players from his l97l
co-champions, wlll still boast the
league’s top nucleus of Veteran’s
with 30 returning lettermen chose-
man squad, including Monmouth’s
top five Scorers.

Most of the other conference
coaches will be involved in talent
searches, trying desperately to re-
place holes left in last year's line-
up, allhough Cornell and (Ice only
lost six players from 1971 squads,
and both coaches claim they have the
"best running quarterback in the
league."
