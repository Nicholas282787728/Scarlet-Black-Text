« HOI'SE FINANCES

Treasuryships are seldom sought, and are never
popular in any organization. The position of building
treasurer is no exception to tllis rule. This year, due to
the general reorganization of the dormitories, and the
reduction of the number 0[ men permitted to live in it
single building, the problem of house finances has her
come even more serious than it has 'been in former yea

What ever the rules for doubling up in the dorinit ,
moms may be, the smaller buildings are always placed
at a serious disadvantage iinnncially, as compared with
the larger buildings. Building budgets run tail-1y high,
and must include arrangements for financing the social
program oi the house, as well as additions to the club-
rooins in the way of mu c newspapers. or extra turns
iture, and also all other incidentals, such as house

it the smaller houses do not wish to place this une
fair extra burden llpon their members, they must reduce
their budget considerably. Such action would necessla
into a program inferior to the standard set by the
other more populous buildings. The smaller houses are
thus inccd either way with a problem. On the one hand
they may adopt the standard of expenditure of tho cntirc
group, and assess their members high house dues, meet-
ing with much objection, and additional difficulties of
collection. 0n the other hand, they may reduce the
budget. assess the men not more than in the other
hou. ., and thus taco the objection that they are offers
mg on interior social program.

Such a situation is obviously uni/air to the men who
live in the smaller houses. Theyil‘tave been able to
excl 'sc no selection as to house and are unable, aftcr
cntei ug :i house, to enlarge it or increase its member-
ship hy menu: of crowding. The whole situation arises
simpl, in the nature of the physical arrangement of the
buildings. Since the college chose to erect the buildings
as they are, it should be willing to entertain some plan
oi house budgeting which will equate the buildings as

units,

with very few exceptions most of the expenses of a
house have no relation to the size of the house. This
furnishes us with a key to the solution ot the problem.
Why shouldn't some flat assessment he determined upon
and charged all men alihc, collected through the college
trcosurcr's ottice, and distributed to the six huildings in
six payments, eoual except for such items as provision
for dance favors .and smokers. which must vary accord-
ing to the membership of the hull? We should very
much favor the adoption of some such plan, and urge
upon the Council of House Chairmen, and the t‘ollegc
Treasurer its early consideration, Wc are sure that the
morale and general tonc of dormitory lite would be mu'ch

improved with the solution of this financial question. I

ORGANIZATION DANCES

Campus organizations should consider it a. distinct;
privilege to he able to stage the varsity dances during‘
the year. They should be in a position to improve their
financial situation considerably, as \vnll as obtain favoiu
able publicity; and provide a campus service. Every orv
ganizntiou which is given it chance to pllt on n dance
should be especially anxious to make its first one a suc»
cess. and it should he open-minded enough to give a plan
a good trial, which has as its leading purpose the ini-
provement, not alone of the dance situation, but of the
campus in general. We feel that an obligation is placed
upon the organizations to support the plan whole- heart-
edly, at least until it has a. fair trial.
