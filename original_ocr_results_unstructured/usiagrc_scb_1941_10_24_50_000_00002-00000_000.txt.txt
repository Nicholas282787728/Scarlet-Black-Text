Next week at this time, the campus will be
in the throes of Homecoming. Alumni will
be returning by carloads. Trains Wlll drop

OCTOBER 24,

dozens of fun-bound alumni at the station. '

Perhaps even now, one of last year’s sen—
iors is seriously considering “thumbing” his
way back to Grinnell.

With Homecoming comes an abundance
of confusion. Hands are shaken, Bull ses-
sions begin and last throughout the night.
Football is in the air. The campus will be
in a festive spirit.

Books, studies, that Payne test, all will
be far away from the minds of students
next Friday night. To go to classes the
following day would not only be a waste of
time, but a violation of the Grinnell spirit.

We request the faculty and administra-
tion to suspend classes a week from to—

view.

Picture in your mind a scraggly cow sitting
in a luscious clover patch slowly starving
to death while gazing longingly into a
neighboring field. Ludicrous, if it didn’t
st ike so close to home.

Friday night Gl'innellians will be treated
to an exceptionally fine piano and organ
recital by Professor Blum and Mrs. Ryan.
Both performers are musical artists of the
first rank. Heard in this unusual combina-
tion, their artistic effectiveness is mater—
ially increased.

No attention should be detracted from
the coming appearance of the internation—
allyefamous Violinist, Albert Spalding. His
genius speaks for itself.

To return to the lowly cow, the object
lesson is obvious. Let us take advantage
of the superior talent in our own backyard
and not starve in the midst of plenty.

May we make a suggestion?

Grinnell students spend a good deal of
time griping. They drop in the White
House, growl about the social problem, com—
plain about the food, find fault with the
administration, and generally feel that
they’d be better off dead.

With such a mental attitude,
they would be better off dead.

The students need a causega cause they
can believe in, a cause that is important
and timely. Psychiatrists could call such a
cause “occupational therapy.”

Might we suggest National Defense as a
banner that could be carried? Even though
it meant nothing more than rolling band-
ages, forming battalions, or knitting socks,
it would be far better than listening to
the perpetual Grinnell gripe.

Futhermore, it could give the Chips,
Friars, Mortar Board, YMCA, YWCA, to
mention but a few practically dead or-
ganizations, something to live for.

Don‘t get mad. We were only suggest-

The new voucher system of ac-
counting has been authorized by
the Treasurer's office, according
to Robert Jensen, student auditor.

Under this new system, all stus
dents who handle the finances of
student organizations must pre—
sent a voucher to the merchant
from whom they do their pur-
chasing. -

If they do not present the
voucher, the merchant will refuse
to fill their ordcr, A duplicate
copy of the voucher \vlll be turned
in to the Treasures office, Jensen
said.

This will enable the financial
heads of the student organization)
to keep unpaid bills from accum-
ulating, according to Jensen.
