by Michael Greenfield
This weekend’s movie fare in-
cludes two outstanding motion
pictures thatoiier the best of every
element involved in film In other
words, Persona tisc7t and Laura
(19447 should he made an integral
part oi your weekend plans.
Persona is a haunting and
evocative story which reveals
more insights with each successive
viewing. Despite its painiul subject
matter. it is a pleasurable movie
experience.
The Setting is the haunting,
rocky and piney seaside typical oi
Bergman films, and the action is

provided by two heroines caught ‘

up in an entanglement of curiosity,

passion, and disgust, Elisabeth, a
successful actress, and Alma, a
nurse. are people who seemingly
have everything to live for.

Having undergone a sudden,
inexplicable breakdown, Elisabeth
refuses to utter a sound and is
placed under psychiatric care.
with Alma as her lnexperienced
nurse In retreating from the
vlorld Elisabeth is expressing her
dissatisfaction with the horror of a
liietiinc spent in mere seeming
Instead of being, and mm the
graver horror that no one had
discovered this feeling.

To speed her cure the
psychiatrist suggests that Alma
and Elisabeth spend a few weeks at
the psychiatrists isolated cottage.
The two. young women go_ott
together. one silent and torlorn, the
other talkative and unself-
consclous. Ultimately an as»
tonishing phenomenon occurs: in
their increasing intimacy the two
women begin to exchange per-
sonallties

Whether this occurs in reality or
tantasy is a question presented
with such a lucid yet shadowy
ambiguity that the \’le\\er is utr
terly mesmerized lt should also be
noted that this film stars [We

this task, faithful mounr

don’t seem to mind, do it.
Then turn on the
