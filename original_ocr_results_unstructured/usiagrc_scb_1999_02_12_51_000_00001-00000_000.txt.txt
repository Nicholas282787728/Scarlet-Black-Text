ments ﬁled this week,

Archie Robert Bear, 30, remains in
the Poweshlek County Jail in lieu of
$250,000bond,accusedinthedeathof
Max Lavem Purk, 23, ofGrundy Cen»
ter, a former Tama resident. Bear is
charged with ﬁrstrdegree murder.

The slaying took place in the 800
block ofFillh Ave, between Broad and
Park streets.

In a sworn afﬁdavit ﬁled in Pow-
esliiekCounty DistrictCourt,Grinnell
police Sgt. Randy Hanssen recounts
details of what took place.

The afﬁdavitstatesthatstaffath'n-
nell Regional Medical Center placed a
911 emergency call to police at 1:53
am. Saturday, requesting that an of-
ﬁcer go to tlle hospital. A male “with
severe neck lacerations" had been
brought in and had died from his
wounds

‘Just sliced someone’s throat”

“Atthetime ofﬁcerswcrcatthe emerr
gency room, defendant [Bear] entered
the frontdoorofthe Police Department,
stating,‘Ijustslicedsomeone’sthroat,“’
the afﬁdavit reports. “Dispatch imme
diately requested ofﬁcers to reium to
the station. Defendantwas requested to
remain. He failed to comply.“

As Bear took off, he was chased by
aJasperCountydeputy, whose name is
not contained in the afﬁdavit. “Defenr
dant was seen exiting from in between
two homes," the document states. “As
he was approaching the off»duty
deputy,defcndant said, ‘I cuthisthroat.’
Defendant also said the guy had hit
him in the nose, so he cut his throat.”

Authorities found two witnesses to
the incident, according to the court
document.“Informationprovidedsupr
ported statements made by the defen-
dant," the afﬁdavit slates. Those wit—
nesses saw Bear slash Purk‘s throat,
and Bear “was seen in possession/con-
trol of this knife immediately after
inﬂicting this violent act.”

According to Hanssen‘s afﬁdavit,
one witness repeatedly yelled at Bear,
“You killed him."

Davis playground effort launched

’Studentchoice’
guides new
Davis playground

“Student choice" are the key words
in a plan to develop a new playground
at Davis Elementary School.

Third and fourth grade students at
the school ﬁrst were polled on their
choices of a variety of playground
equipment available from Miracle
Playground Equipment Company, then
whenthcirchoiceswerecompiledthey
held a discussion sessron with Curt
Schroeder, representing the company,
on further ideas about how they think
their new playground should be.

The playground is expected to be
installed this year to replace a play-
ground developed in 1984 by Davis
parents and students but largely dis-
mantled as the result of construction of
anewwingoftheor‘rginalDavisbuild-
ing, now a grade—level school.

The playground project, which is
envisioned asbeinginstalledthis year,

already is on hand, according to Doug
Cameron, Davis principal,

Davis students this week are in the
midst ofa penny drive which thus far

has resulted in contributions of $2000.
The drive will continue throughout the
month of February. Solicitation ofparr
ents, alumni and community members
will begin in March.
