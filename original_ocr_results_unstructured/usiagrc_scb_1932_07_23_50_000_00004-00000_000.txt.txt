By MAX ROSS

The dawn of a. new football season
will see the return of 12 lettcrroen to
form a nucleus for the 1932 football
squad. At present the squad has such
potential strength that even in view
of the lack of experience only optim~
ism prevails. A number of valuable
reserves and freshmen will gladden
the hearts of Coaches Watt and Duke,
who are faced with the difficult task
of whipping a team into shape in the
short space of two weeks.

r t i

Peculiar-1y enough, Doc Huff, the
only other Gi-innell man to partici-
pate in an Olympic Games carnival,
is going west with Coach Duke to
see Morgan Taylor in action Huff
coached Taylor when the hitter was
at Grinnell in 1923, 24, and 25, Huff,
himself one of Grilulell‘s greatest
sprinters, represented the United
suites in Landau in 1903. He is now
head track coach at the University

01 Missouri.

ks:

Duke is somewhat chagrinen at
the failure of Brocksmith and'oLhers
to run in the longer 5000 and 10000
meter races in the final Olympic trye
outs, thus allowing men of inferior
ability to gain places on the team.
At present the U. S. is conceded lit-
tle chance to win in these events.

a i a

if it had been known in adinnce
that Brocksmith and others were to
stay out of the 5000-metor mice, Mike
Pilbl'ow would in all probability have
been trained for that 8‘ ant. Duke
figures that Pilbi-ow, u-ho relies on-
tirely on a judgment of pace. could
turn the distance in 15 minutes with-
out difficulty. The race was won in
14:55, so Pilbrow could have quali-
fled for a phice on the team easily.

,. o .

Morgan Taylor holds three Grinnell
allrtlme records and every perform-
ance is close to a world mark He has
done the 120 highs in 14.7, one-
tenth of a. second slower than the
present existing record. He has trav'
eled the lows in : 3.3, three—tenths
of a second slower, and has done 25
feet 2 inches in the broad jump.

i r a
Taylor also anchored the mile re-
lay team which holds the school rec-
. ord of 3:203, This mark who threat-
ened last year by the Pioneer quartet
of Pojrnnn, Alexander, Murphy, and
Thomas who placed third to Netre
Dame and Michigan at the Drake re«
lays, and who ranked with the lead-
ing college teams of the country.

PERSONALS.

Out in Potter, Nebraska, Millard
Hansen is helping manage a ranch,
but so far he hasn’t quite become ac-
customed to the saddle.

Barbara Neubecker is visiting her
grandmother at Lake Okoboji this
summer. Okoboji seems to be Grin-
neil's summer home.

Walter Secor, '31, has been award-
ed his master's degree at Columbia
university and will teach French at
Luther Wright high school in Iron-
wood, Mich, this fall. Secor compiled
a straight “a" record while at C0-
lumbia, establishing a new record for
scholastic achievement in the depart—
ment of French there. While in Grin-
nell, he was captain of the cross
country team and a member of Phi
Beta Kappa.

Miss Mary Chamberlain, '92, and
former alumni trustee, spent a few
days in Gi-inncll last week vi ng
friends. The Chamberlains were one|
cf the famous earlier Grinnell fam-
ilies. The land on which the quad is
now situated was formerly Chamber-
lain park, and the house now occuV
pied by E. )3. T. Spencer and his fame
ily was Chamberlain House.

lsAltTLiNG AND NUCKOLLS

Twenty-five years of leadership in
Grinnell in Jewelry and optometry is
the record of Bartling and Nuckolls.
In the summer of 1931, the store
was entirely refurnished with mods
,ern walnut fixtures and pendant glass
chandeliers giving Grinnell the most
beautiful jewelry store in the state
of Iowa.

A large room is entirely devoted to,
the profession of optometry, with the
largest przclice in the county. The
room is equipped with up-tonaLe in-
struments for the most accurate op-
tical work.

This store has been headquarters,
for college students for the past 25
years, New students, when you arrive
in Grinnell, one of the first stores
that you will want to visit is Bart-
ling and Nuckolls, where a complete
line of college emblems are carriede

Pioneer Coaches
Have Promising

Grid Material

In all probability the opening prac-
Lice session of the 1932 football squad
will be held September 10 a Missouri
Valley regulation prohihi practice
before that date, but the Pioneers
have a game scheduled with Penn
college Septeinher 23 or zl, so it will
be necessary to utilize every possible
moment.

Two weeks will not give Coach
Lester L. (Fuzz) Watt long to whip
his men into shape for the Penn en-
countcr, especially since he will have
a wealth of valuable material to se-
lect his team from. Twelve lettermen
return for service, and in addition,
there are a number of reserves and
members 0[ last year's freshman
squad who are almost certain to find
their way into the lineup. Although
Coach Watt will have many
veterans on hand, he will not have
a highly season team.

Duncan a star ust Season

Returning wingmen are Frank Dun-
can and Bob McKee, who will be giv-
en a battle for their positions by Dick
Phelps, Harold Anderson, and Miller
Brown, promising sophomores, and
Bill Welsh and Willis Crews, re-
servcs. Duncan, playing his first
season of football of any kind last
year, developed so rapidly that at the
end of the year See Taylor, Des
Moines sports editor. proclaimed him
to he the best end in the state. So
adept was be at catching passes that
he acquired a sufficient number of
points scored on tuchdowns by the
aerial route that he found himself at
the top of the Missouri valley scoring
heap. Although it was his first year-
of football, Taylor picked him in prefr
erence to John Briley, Drake's out
standing all-western end, as the
leading Missouri Valley wingman.
Duncan also was awarded a berth on
the all-state team.
The best of the tackle candidates
is Howard Gould, iunior. who rose
from the ranks of the reserves in
midseason. to prove his worth and
win a letter. To choose another out-
standing tackle from the rest of the
group is impossible. Bob Morgan,
Gordon Meeter, Bob Sutton, Alex
Lake, and Casey Canavan are all
hound to see action.

Guards Plentiful

Guards are equally as numerous.
Rosenbloom, Figland, and Martin
have all \\‘Dn letters at that position,
but they will have to reckon with
Durham. Murray, Edsall, Erwin,
Santi, and others. it is quite proh-
able that Mark Trumbull will be in
uniform again, and if his shoulder
will hold out, he is assured of a regu-
lar berth. Last year it was dislocated
twice, despite braces and other pre»
cautions, but if it has sufficiently
healed, he will he a valuable asset to
the squad and is almost certain of
winning a letter.

The graduation of captain Oscar
Christoffersnn leaves a hole at center
position, which will probably be filled
by Bob McMillin, stellar frosh cen-
ter, whose defensive work was one of
the high spots of the freshman sea~
son last year. He is slightly weak on

[lengthy trip,

 

offense, howevel', and Bob Murray,
who played all the positions on the
line with the frosh last season, may
oust him.

Must Replace Thamlis

The backfield lacks an outstanding
star, such as Thomas was last year.
But 51L :he start of the 1931 season.
Thomas had not risen to his peak,
and it is posslble that Coach Walt
may uncover another SL1! with the
advent of o new year. Someone will
have to be found who can fill the for
ward passing role. Walt has always
relied strongly on an aerial attack;
and the Pioneer success in this branch
of the sport was at times equalled
the best in the middle west. Eleven
out of 15 touchdowns were scored via
the forward pass route last season.

Victor Fini Will be groomed to fill
the passing role, although it may fall
to the lot of Snap James. The hard—
driving Dick Ullrich will furnish the
fireworks for the running plays in the
Watt system.

Captain Graflund is an expert
blocking back, and is a bear on de-
fense backing up the line. His ability
and his knowledge of the game make‘
him a vital part of the Pioneer ma-
chine. Al Rose is the same type of
player as Graflund, big, a good block-
er, and a good defensive man. With
Graﬂund, Flni, Ullrich, and Rose tar
gather In the backfield, Coach Watt
will have a veritable powerhouse.

James Dark Horse

The dark horse of the squad is
Clarence (Snap) James, who has of-
ten shown signs of reaching stardom.
He is light. on his feet, fast, shifty, a
splendid open field runner, and a vic-
ious Lacklcr, This year may be his
year.

Another man who will be hard to
keel) out of the lineup is Harold Alex-
adder, the featherweight speed mel-
chant, who reeled off a number of
long gains last year at psychological
moments. He has acquired the sea-
soiling he needed, and if his defensive
work continues to improve, he may
find himself in the stafﬁng lineup

PERSONALS

ity of life guard at Camp Dodge.

few years.
