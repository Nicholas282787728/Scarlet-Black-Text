Grinnelllans take [or granted. "In my
school in India, it would be a matter oi
pride to go to a math lab or writing lab tor

Al Grinnell it means you are trying harder
at your studies.”

lvturamatsu came irom a university oi
over 30.000 students where it was difficult
to contact professors. Respect for all
elders is stressed in his society. in tact,

rectly. or one is considered rude.

Waltz irom page 9

About the only area the theme will ail‘ect is

The Des Moines Symphony Ensemble
will play again this year, as is traditional
tor the spring waltz. Students generally
agree that the spring iraltz is prererable to
the {all waltz because of the live mUSlC. “It
is more, well romantic with an
orchestra," Said junior Mike Wilson,

 

takes a summer in iront or a TV to ieel
more in place."

The sharing or cultural and social pat
terns is enriching, though irustratlng at
times. Grinnell grows accustomed to a
diverse group of students each year, and
’those students apparently enjoy the
challenge oi living in a community quite
like their own. Khullood Rahman said,
“My education has been in seeing a culture
completely diiierent irom mine. it has

been an invaluable experience."

Tederman said. "The concern of the
students is Ihat we have been ‘dormatize
ing.‘ and that cooperative houses should
be an alternative to the dorms. I think
ihere is legitimacy in lhis. We want to give
as many alternatives to students as possi»
ble."

The next house due for renovation, 1130
East. will not be worked on for at least
another year. Tederman said, “That is a
house we're gomg to be careful with."
