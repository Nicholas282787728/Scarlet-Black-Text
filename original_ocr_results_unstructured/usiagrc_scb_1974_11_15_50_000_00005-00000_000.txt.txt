Phillips: 'remove the books'

To the Editor:

I cannot resist commending
Grinnell for providing its students
witll such great facilities We
students have the P.E complex.
which provides us with running,
swimming, tennis, paddle boil and
innumerable other facilities. We
also have the forum. and (lie Pub
where one can eat, and drink,
watch T.V., play pool or ping ping.
andlisten to music. l'lDHL’VEl’, I feel
the most commendable facility till
this campus is the library

Ellis, Nyman:

To the campus community:

We would like to focus the at
tention oi the student body on a
matter close at hand, The Grinncil
College Coltec i-iouse, located in
Ihc Forum, has been in operation
sinee the beginning of the year on a
regular basis. We. as eo-managers
oi this nonprotit organization,
have put in many hours or our time
to make the Coffee House a suc
cess. The students who bake, sell
and entertain for us enjoy pars
ticipating in the Coffee House, and
the campus community enjoys the
results otoiir eiiorts and the shorts
of our volunteer workers.

Since last spring we have at
tempted to get tunds and salaries
trom sch. The tunds are needed to
buy new equipment, to pay for
entertainment and lo mainlian low
prices, the salaries are traditional
as the Coffee House manager has
always received a salary tor this
time-consuming responsibility.
Due to the red tape so skillfully set
up by our budding bureaucrats, we

must admit though, the decor of
the library is rather oppressive
and not very lunctionai, All those
books and shelves are not only ugly
and a constant reminder of 0110‘s

the lonely student, they are
literally a Wall between him and

Perhaps they should remove the

Gay perspectives

But is it

By Jain. hiasoii

A iriend oi mine was once asked,
with regard to his gayncss, if he
thought of himscli as “sick.” He
was somewhat taken aback by the
query, which is not as unusual as
one might hope, Generally it is
expressed slightly more tactiuily,
as. for instance. “But do you think
homosexuality is normalv"

This question usually seems to
concern “normalcy" in a mental or
psychiatric sense. Psychiatry has
adapted the medical concepts oi
health and sickness to the
description oi cognitive and

99

emotional processes Un-
tortunateiy, this classifying or
inner experience into ‘healthy‘ and
‘sick’ has become too popular. in
our culture, the psychiatrist has
assumed the former role of the
priest. When w-c speak oi “nur-
malcy” we often suggest morality,
and when we speak oi “Sickness”
we are apt to mean something akin
to sin

The flaw in this process lies in
forgetting that “normal” in \he
medical sense is a descriptivi-
adjective only; itis not intended to
carry any moral connotation in its
popular-psychiatric use, the idea or
normalcy iurnishcs a iiandy
vehicle for the chronic human
habit ot trying to tell other people
what they may and may not think.
It is foolish. and often risky, to
allow another person to rule on the

Whatever tits your own ex-

it is right A psychiatric model oi
normalcy ought never to he
allowed to separate you irom your
sincere response to lite when that
response includes sexual leelings
towards those oi the same sex, the
verbal phantom oi ‘normalcy’
should not be conjured up to make
you deny such ieeiings,

A question as to whether or not it
is normal to be gay is otton askcd
somewhat apprehensively, as it an

99

airirmative answer would be
threatening, it should be evident
that the question is properly that or
”normal for whom?" This is not a
