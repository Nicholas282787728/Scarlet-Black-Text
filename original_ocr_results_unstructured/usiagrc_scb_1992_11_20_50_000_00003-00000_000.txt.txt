W y are we
seeing hate
symbols

on south ?
by Guen Gifford

Why did someone draw anu-gny
symbols anamcs, Haincs. and Read halls
lasi week? Well. probably because they
feel like iheir views are not being re-
spccled or even heard on Lhis “liberal"
campus. They know Lhal if ihey ex-
pressed lhclr scnllmenls openly, people
would respond wuh harsh, personal critic
clsm,

The arnounl of suppori oi Grinnell
College {or gay people ond gay righis is
wonderful. as is worlhy of a good liberal-
zhinking college. Bui who: abouz leuing
everyone'sviewsbeheardmdrespeered?
These are also wonderrul values, wothy
of e good liberal-ihinking college.

l'mnoisaying ihonhecampus Come
muniry shouldn'i respond sirongly [0
people wnling haiehil ihings dorm walls.
This son of expression is huriful, dlsrcA
specirul, end inappropriate. As sleslnan,
I am poriieularly disiurberl and scared by
anllrgay gralrin, and seeing asLmng gayr
positiveresponsu from [he adminislrallon
and siudeni body is very imporiani lo me.

I valuehighly rho concern and anger
shown by many members of ihe Hames
and James Hall Councils. lam hearlencd
by ihe educalional programs now being
planned by Heines RA Slave Schneiier
and olhers lo address lllc problems of
halrcd and violence toward yb/‘l people
and oiher mmorlry groups.

But I am concerned [hm rhcsc re»
spouses will no\ be sufficient lo bring
people togclhcr rind gel uiem lo acl rer
speeirully ioward each order, The people
