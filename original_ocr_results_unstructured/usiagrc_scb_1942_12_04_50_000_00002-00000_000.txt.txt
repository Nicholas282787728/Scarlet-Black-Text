From Infamy To Humilify---

Monday marks the first anniversary of
what promises to become a national day
of introspect and remembrance. December
7, 1941, was the “day that shall live for-
ever in infamy,” said President Roosevelt.
Indeed much has happened since the at-
tack on Pearl Harbor. Here in Iowa, in
the middle of our vast country, we see
on the surface only the effects of con—
sumer l'estlictions. We can ”gaze at the
heavens any night and the same things
men have seen for centuries, but those
same heavens have seen a tremendous
change in this country.

From apathy and smugness, the
American people have been molded into a
unity of resolution—of determination to
wipe the memory and the cause of De-
cember 7, 1941, from their sphere of liv-
ing. December ‘7, 1942, looks back upon
the immediate and severe losses our

fighting forces suffered for months after
our entrance into the war. The heavens
have seen the armies of many nations
beaten but not resigned to defeat. They
have seen men gloat, predict and lie.
They have heard the Axis tell us that We
were soft, washed up. That we didn’t
desewe the standard of living We had;
that we were too weak to fight effective
ly for what we said were our ideals.

But the heavens have also seen
Americans in revolt against their former
selves. They have seen us climb out of
our warm, dark crysalis with a new de-
termination; to admit that we undersesti-
mated our opponents, and then, with that
knowledge and its strength, to prove that
they, too, underestimated us. The dif—
ference is that their underestimation will,
we believe, prove fatal for them; ours,
we believe, will prove to be the awakener
necessary for final victoiy.

Dec. 7, 1942, looks down upon two al-
liances facing a turning tide. That tide
is not yet tulned; the undercurrents have
not ebbed awa ; but the irresistable pull
of strength and depth is beginning. A
year ago the enemy was “infamous” one
of our leaders says. We say, in greater
condemnation, that they were too proud.
Now begins a lesson in humility exacted
by the weight of force and will. But that
force and will, our force and will, have
also sprung from humility—a humility
learned by this nation in a year not too
propitious. Humility has cut away much
of the gross and the proud and the gild-
ed from American life. Beneath this has
been found the first solid traces of a
lean, hard, quiet determination. It is that
determination, not an inherent superior—
ity, which can, which shall, which must
win this war.

America, from Dec. 7, 1941, to Dec.
7, 1942, has not learned her lesson com-
pletely. But we think she has found the
right book, that in these last few weeks
she has even found the proper page.

At Ames, Sunday, December a,
J. Forrest West, head of the Grin-
nell music department, will be
one of four guest soloists in the
Iowa State college presentation
of Handle’s “Messiah," according
to a music department announce-
cement, today.

West will slug the bass solos,
"Why Do the Nations Rage,”

DECEMBER 4, |942

"The People That Walketh in
Darkness," and “For Behold Dark-
ness shall Cover the Earth.”

The Amcs chorus of two hun-
dred and forty Voices and the
Iowa State symphony orchestra,
will be under the direction of Tal-
bert Macrae, head of the Iowa.
State college music department.

Success in battle is a keynote
theme of the :Officer Candidate
School. But, according to reliable
reports, onudidacc Dali] revises
the theme along the lines of suc-
cess in starting battleSAOf a mild
nature. of course. It required a
bit of ingenuity on the part of
Candidate Bernard J. Ochs to gel:
out from behind the well known
eight-ball with his feminine com-
panion after a Dnld comment.
Is it true that Candidate Fleiss

Latest moniker for the con-

Leo Label. When the Candidates
form their lines on the walk, they
will kindly fall in under the

speaking about red, the Candi-
dates are planning on “chipping
