The stuidiest of all typewriters

People who do not know, are apt to think
that a typewriter weighing only 656
pounds can’t be as strong as a heavy
cast-iron machine.

But the fact is that no typewriter in the
world has proved itself able to stand the
punishment Corona has taken during its
16 years of service

All through the war, thousands of
Coronas were in use on every battle
front. Almost every war correspondent
carried hileoronai

The secretaries of the welfare organiza-
tions were Corona—equipped and some
thirty thousand more Coronas traveled
with thelAmerican Army The type-
writer for home use should be simple,
sturdy, “fool-proof” ~and Corona has
proven that it has these qualities.

Or if convenient, pay $50 cash.

Small monthly payments

Even though Corona costs only half
what you would pay for a big ‘y‘heavy”
machine, you need not pay for it all at
once The small monthly payments of
$5 each will hardly be missed, and,
almost before you realize it, Corona will

be fully paid for.

And all the time you are paying, you
will have the use of Corona—in fact, you
can very easily do extra Work with this
little typewriter which will pay for it
several times over!

We are authorized distributors for the
Corona Typewriter Company, and we
stand behind every Corona we sell. And
behind us is the Corona factory which
has built and sold nearly half a million
Coronas.
