“In the last few years the‘
best work which is being writ—

rather than the novel,” Peden
stated during his morning lec—
ture on “Short Fiction Sincc
1950." ‘
“More and more volumcs ol-
good short stories are being‘
published , . . The short story
is essentially the young writer’s
medium. It is there he learns
to be a professional rather than
an amateur,” hc continucd.

of good short stories that have.
been published recently in subsf

plotted story with more readcrl
interest.” .
