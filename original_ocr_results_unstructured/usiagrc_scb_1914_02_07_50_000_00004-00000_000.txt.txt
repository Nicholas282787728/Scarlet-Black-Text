CURRICULUM IS DISCUSSED

Prof. Bailey Treats Religious and.
Practical Value of System

“The Curriculum" was Mr. llttllel's
suinet-t at llle Y. .\i. c. a, meeting
Thursday night He said that the tru
ditional athtude toward the ourrlcw
ltun was lor the student hotly to under»
estimate it, for the faculty to ove‘
estimate it. and lor the administration
to stand as a mediator hctween lhe
two hodies. There is some truth in
the contention often heard that the
man who succeeds in outside activittes
will be the man who will succeed in
life

this is in part recognized hr the col.
logo. and outside ucti ties which have
lii‘uvon their worth are constantly be
