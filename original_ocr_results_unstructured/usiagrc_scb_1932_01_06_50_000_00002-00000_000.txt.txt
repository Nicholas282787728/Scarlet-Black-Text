WELCOME, BUTLER

The addition at Butler to tho Mi, 'ouvi Volley
coul‘rrouce is further midollcc of thc . andillg til
the circuit ill middle \vcstttrn athletic circles do-
spitc the break which many Sports critic thought
would lncan tho end of tho loop a few years ago.
\Vlieli the Bit Six broke in , loavi g only Drillin-
dlid Grinllell i members of the conference, the
building pnoc , tartcd \\ h the addition of washf
ington and (. gllton universities and the Okla
holna Aggics. Now Butler 1 ‘1’ it a si ' team coll-
forencc and there are pos es of adding St.
Louis ullivcrsitl‘, Tulsa university or Marqurtte.

The changes, of course, mean expansion. Mis-
souri Valley no longcr refers to the location of the
member institutions any more than the Big Three
means that Harvard, Yale, and Princeton have the
best teams ill the country. It i. simply a title by
lvllich the organization may be known

Perhaps there is more to the Missou'i Valley
conference than writers who predicted demise
could see on the surface. It is significant that at
a time when some colleges are trying to leave Mid
west conference, and the Iowa coufcrencc remodel-
ing- is bring suggested, the Valley loop continues
on a steady program of building its own Clrvuit
and trengtllcning its athletic prestige,

G 'nncll, as the smallest college in the confer—
ence, can only wclconlr newcomers and hope that
they will not be too surprised when they see the
brand of athletics backed by a little lowa college
of loss than 700 student souls.

CODDLED COLLEGIANS

' Seniors ill hundreds of colleges and univcrsie
tics in tllcse United Slates are now beginning to
wonder, ’l they draw near their last semester of
college lllt‘r just how useful their education will
be to Ilhenl. They have watched professors, burdens
ed with a variety of qualifications, try for folli-
years to endow students with \ dam and profic-
iency. Now those seniors are just about ready to
go out and tackle the world themselves.

, If these men and women have never thought
of it before, they nevertheless begin to realize now
that the race very often goes to the strong who
have the advantage of either moral courage or
cunning. Although it is not necesary to ”accept
the world,” knowing it isn‘t a bad idea. If there
is any one way ill which college does not prepare
‘thc student for the world it is, as exemplified in
Grinnoll, in failing to give, him any conception of
the vicissitudes to be encountered

As the editor of a contemporary collegiate
publication put it, “A college training offers the
student his last chance to feel the heat without
burning his fingers, and as smug as most college
students are ill this respect, in their cocoon of so
pllisticatioli, they have a great deal to learn rind
they aro goil ' to learn it to the last letter even
if they obstilmtcly persist, in keeping the eyes
closed to eve vtlling that may offend their sense
of propriety and tbei prodiOious vanity.”

If there is any on ticlslu to he made of
prof ors as it lVlIOlL‘, it 1 ill their ilul'c to blast
all ' the ixllildisllnoss. so often lt’l'llltlt “animal
spirits,” shown by students. Ii ‘leiSilJlt‘ altitudes
annoy them as much as any, probably, but many
have alloivud lllcluscll to botaomo callonscd and
have lost. lllt' dc r of l‘t’l‘Ot'llil-llﬂ’ tlllytlllt'

Ono ll tates to think of the Icolll of 1mm-
crous collogions, who, having been ntnllyi tlillcd
as to tlu-il- whims alld vanili ' during four
of higher learning, will he rudely awakened by U
harsh world llith no regard for their college
“daze.”

THEY DRINK LIKE LADIES
(From the Daily Northwestern)

“Drinking among Northwestern women is a prob
lem no house mother on the campus has encountered,
according to a survey made yESterday of the women's
quadrangle," So Spoke a Daily news story yesterday
which continued, to quote various of the quadrangle
mothers who said they had not noticed any feminine
drinking in this good Methodist institution.

It seems that coeds do not. drink, mid that although

there are a few crude and boorisli men of the university ,

who cause trouble at open houses wi n their liquor-ed
breaths and liquored actions, men drink but lightly.
That is the consensus of houseemother opinion,

It is by no means our intention to besmircb the »

fair name of Northwestern, but in the interests of truth

and accuracy, someone should modify the statements of
the house mothers. Northwestern men and women do 3’

not drink publicly or obnoxiously. That a very large
portion of our coeds do drink, though always in a lady-
like fashion, must be admitted in the sad causes of
truth and accuracy.

Probably Northwestern is an unusually moral insti-
tiition, judging from reports of football weekends at
other institutions. Such popular resorts as the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin and the University of Iowa have much
to teach us, even if hearsay is heavily discounted. But
Northwestern is by no means a prohibition tester, and
Northwestern women are by no means tee-totalers, for
which may the Gods be thanked. We drink. but always
in ladylike fashion,

FREEDOM OF PETTING
(From the Daily Illini)

Out where the West has begun and where Dude
ranching is a large industry, private petting is a big
issue. Students at the University of Wyoming are back
In school after a strike brought on by interference of
Dr, A. G, crane, the president of their institution, in
love-making activities. They demand an apology for
pointed remarks made by the president to petters parked
in their cars during an intermission, The board of
trustees are to sit on the case, but. have already an-
nounced that they will stand behind the president.

When a college president descends to the regular
tion of petting, he belongs to another age. students
have a right to object to such interference, for petting
in an automobile is really private petting and not public
until an absolute Mid-Victorian makes it so.

sororities, group system houses and even staid
‘4 tessy” hall have their petting parlors, and as long
hours are kept and lights are not turned too low, the
bunnies can rub noses and exchange 10,000 bacteria
for 10,000 bacteria without harming anything but the
shirt collar and the hairdressers waves. Peekeaamo col-
lege deans and presidents only excite widespread in-
dignation, needless ill-feeling and laughs by pussy-foot-
ing in the realms of petting. None but the softies fail
for the davenport stuff anyway, and for a college presi-
dent to condescend to notice softies is absurd.

QUARTERS 0R SEMESTERS?
(From the Iowa State Student)

During the last year there has been some discussion
by members of the faculty on the question of changing
the quarter system at Iowa state college to the semester
system. The two term year‘is almost standard through-
out the educational institutions of the country. Iowa
state is one of the few schools that divides the school
year into three “quarters." The summer session is known
as the fourth quarter, Prof J. B. Davidson. head or the
Department ot Agricultural Engineering, has been ap—
pointed to conduct a survey on the relative advantages
and disadvantages of the two systems. The possibile

ity of changing to the semester system has been discuss— ,

ed at a number of faculty meetings.
There are many reasons for changing to the semes-
ter system. The transfer of credits from other schools

would be simplified and there would be more standard~ .

izotion in courses between this school and others. It i
claimed that some subjects are not covered thoroughly
enough at Iowa State because of the short length of
term.

Likewise, there are many reasons for continuing
under the present quarter system. The quarter system
is advantageous to students who do not care to go to
school for a half year at a time. Many students, par-
ticularly at. Iowa State, drop out during the spring quare
tcr to help with the farm work others cannot go dur-
ing the fall for the same reason. The quarter system
simplifies the vacation question. The Christmas vaene
tion causes a split in the first semester in schools where
the two term rule prevails. A

It will be interesting to note the result of Professor
Davidson's survey.
