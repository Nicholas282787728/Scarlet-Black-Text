THE GAME of lacrosse has been
rapidly coming into prominence
in late years among eastern col-
leges and universities, and the in~
telest now shown in it bids fair to
be as strong as the interest in any
of the spring sports. The game
is highly enjoyed by those who
play it and is well adapted for all
who love athletic sports, It is al-
most unknown to the colleges ot
the West, but we think it might
well be madea part oftheirspring
athletics, The students of Grin-
nell, as well as cf other institu-

the game and its merits as an in
tercollegiale athletic contest.

Two YEARS ago this winter the
students after considerable discus-

to report all cases ot cheating that
Come under their observation and
the faculty is expected to agree
WIth the decision of the court in
regard to any case which may
come up. The purpose otthe sys-
tem is not so much to punish of-
tenders as it is to deter students
from cheating. The work of the
court since its formation has been
entirely satisfactory, and it the
students will but perform their
part there is no doubt of the sucr
eess ot the system. There are
many, however, who think that as
long as they themselves are hon-
est in their examinations that is
all that can rightly be expected
oi them. In this they are miss
taken. it is to no purpose to dis
cuss now whether the “Honor
System” is the best way in which
