Mass Voting by Machine
Faretold by N. Y. Inventor

New York Cityi'l'he quick col-
lection and tabulation of votes will
be made possible in the future by the
use of the “televotes,” an apparatus
for electrical voting, its inventor, Dr.
Nevil M. Hopkins, former lecturer at
New York university, dairned here
in demonstrating his new device.

The apparatus devised by Dr. Hop-
kins is sc arranged as to make voting
entirelysecret, as well a permitting
of voting by large audiences simultan.
eously. He even envisions large and.
iences, in theatres and other gathering
places, voting at one time upon naa
Iional questions. The results would be
tabulated by some central agency set
up for that purpose.

Each person in the audience would
be equipped with a small push but-
ton with which he would record his
vote. This button would be connect»
ed to a resistance circuit. and the
total resistance offered would give the
percentage of votes registered for or
against the question.

Richard Cozad, ’36, and Rollin Hun»
sicker, ’36, spent last weekend at the
farmer’s home in Omaha.

Donald Malum, ’35, spent the week-
end with his parcna, Mr. and Mrs.
N. G. Malum of Des Molnes.

With Popular Conception of Scholar

Talented Phi Beta Member
Mixes Sports, Sermons
With Scholarship

The comic—opera conception of the
Phi Beta Kappa scholar is so firmly
imbedded in the average mind thal
few can see a Phi Beta other than as
a sedentary, owlish sort of creature
with his nose continually poked into
a book, and with no interests other
than cramming facts into his brain.

That die average l’hi Beta Kappa
member of recent years no longer fits
this description may at least partially
be explained by the fact that qualie
fications for membership have of late
been extended to include other qual»
ities in addition to scholarship But
whatcvcr the reason, the modern Phi
Beta is more frequently than not ac—
complished in other fields in addition
to scholarship.

Comrd, Exhibit A

Consider, for example, .loseph Con»
ard of Lansdowne, Pa, a Grinncll
college senior. a Phi Beta, a verse.
tlla entertainer, a public speaker, lead—
er in a half dozen campus activities,
a writer, and a man who is active in
body as well as in mind.

Canard has received no grade below
“A" during his college career. Yet
he has found time to become a meme
her of the editorial board of The Scar—
let and Black; president of such or-
ganizations as the Young Men’s Chris.
tian association, thc_ Sunday Evening
club, and the Men's Forensic Club;
director of the International Relations
conference, and founder of the local
Internau'onal Relations club.

Proaclledl Two Years

In addition to his activities in cam-
pus organizations, he preached for two
years in Lhe Westfield church near
Grinnell, preparing a scrmon every
fortnight.

He is well known in this section of
the state for his ventl-iloquist act, an
art which he learned as a boy of 10
at Westow'n boarding school near
Philadelphia. Other stunts which he
has presented in public in—
clude a memory test in which he
remembers 20 or 30 words and names
shouted at him in quick succession by
members of the audience, apd rcpcals

 

them tor-ward, backward or by nume
bars,
Just a 'l‘rick

“This is just a trick," he divulged.
“I have a set list of words, correspond.
ing with each number from 1 to 30,
which I have memorized. These arc
simple words,

“As the audience shouts iLs words
and names to me, I associate them with
my set list of words and form a men—
tal picture of each association. They’re
then easy to recall, whether in order,
or hlt and miss."

Tennis Finalist

Conard declares that he has found

this method to advantage in public

speaking also, obviating the necessity
for preparing notes.

During his three years at Crinucll
he has been a finalist in the annual
intramural tennis tournament. He al.
so cxccls at anolhcr sport, ice skating,
having won a silver trophy as cham—
pion figure skater of his preparatory
school in Pennsylvania.

It is probable that Collard Will an.
ter work involving international. I‘ee
latlons, or he may procccd to law
school. In either case kc can be cited
as an outstanding example of the Phi
Beta Kappa of today.
