Prof. Main and tile college should
be congratulated.

There can be little doubt lhat
ilic iuturc oi the coilcgc dcpcnds
vt-l-y largeiy upon ille atlitildeot
llsgl‘aduates. Anythingand every~
lhiilg should be done to create
and hold the liveliest and largest
possible interest on the part of
these graduates.

Among other things, the Alumr
nl ot recent ycars should, in a
larger degree, be taken into tile
conﬁdence otthc college.

Among those coming out trom
the college, within the past ten
years, are many, whoifnotplomi~
iient in the affairs of the world at
present, will soon be prominent;
and the support and co-operation
of these men should be cultivated.
insofar as is possible. I mention
the classes of the past ten years,
because they are much larger
thantheclassesbelongingtoearlir
er decades, and because I know
that in them are many strong
men.

Members oftlle Board of Trus-
tees and Older Graduates may
sometime die off, and it will be
well to have younger men and
women trained in loyalty and love
to Alma Mater,

There are in and about Chicago
a laigc number of Iowa College
men and women who are, more
or less, in danger ot bemg some-
what lost to the college. because
of a lack of something to nourish
and keep alive their interestill
the institution from which they
were graduated.

We have a Chicago Alumni
Association that meetsa couple
oftimes per year and does what
it can,by way ofsocial intercourse.
and attcr dinner speeches. to cul-
tivate the “Grinnell Spirit"! We
would be glad, if we could make

 

this association a source of real
help to the college; and we would
also be pleased to be considered
as a factor in determining. in a
slight degree at least. the policy
otthe coilcgc. As I understand
it the N220; Lezlzrhas an aim simi»
lar to the aim of the Chicago
Alumni Association; viz, the spirr
itllal uniﬁcation of the graduales
