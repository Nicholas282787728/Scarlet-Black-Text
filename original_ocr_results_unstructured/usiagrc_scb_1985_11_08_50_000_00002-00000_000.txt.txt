oi nuclear weapons should not

be withdrawn because “the threat oi such
use by NATO is a deterrent to Soviet..,ag~
gression "

McNamara traced the history of present
NATO policy. starting with John Foster
Dulles' “Massive Retaliation” policy that
called ior a greater dependency on
NATO's ability to “retaliate instantly by
[nuclear] means and at places of our own
choosing "

The Kennedy administration reviewed
NATO policy and the President authorized
McNamara to substitutea stategy of “flex-
ible response” tor the then existing doc»
trine. This policy. which called for a build
up oi NATO'S conventional iorces permit
led a “substantial raising of the nuclear
threshold by...responses to Soviet aggres-
sion to be made by convention Iorces
alone."

McNamara believes that it would not be
in the interest of NATO to initiate a
nuclear attack. He said “initial use of even
a small number or nuclear weapons im-
plies risks which could threaten the surr
vlval of our civilization."

In Thursday's convocation lecture. titled
"Geneva can be a Giant Step Toward a
More Secure ZlSt Century”. McNamara
Said that “the arms negotiations in Geneva
do represent an historic opportunity."

The talks are “a game from which both
sides can emerge as winners." said
McNamara. However, McNamara said it
was unlikely that the President would
trade away restrictions on the Strategic
Defense initiative (SDI) for reductions in
Soviet offensive weapons. "1 don't think
SDI is a bargaining ploy. The President
sincerely believes in it." But McNamara
believes the President is t‘altacking the
right problem with the wrong solution."

McNamara said that SDI is “so far in the
luture that it has no relevance." and that
in tact there are two "Star Wars" pro
grams that have "diametrically opposite
objectives.” "Star Wars l." McNamara
said. "would Substitute defensive [oroifen-
sive lorces.“ St r Wars 11 requires that
“we continue ‘ th offensive forces. but

news conlerence earlier on, Thursday.
McNamara described Star Wars ll as
“leaky"l.

McNamara said the Soviets interpret
our decision to supplement our oitensive
forces With defenses as “an attempt to
achieve a iirst strike capability." This will
prevent any agreement on oriensive
weapons.

Neither star Wars 1 nor Star Wars ii, in
McNamara's opinion. is an etioctive
response to “the public's awareness oi the
unacceptable risk posed by our present
nuclear strategy." He outlined three post»
Hiroshima lessons that shaped his pro
posal: the us and the Soviet Union are

either mutually secure or mutually in-
secure; that the nuclear arms race IS a
burden to both sides: and concerning
nuclear disarmament. that "no realistic
scheme that would rid us oi all nuclear
weapons has ever been ioi-mulatcd and i
do not believe one will be,”

The ultimate goal ()1 negotiators at
Geneva should be “a state oimutual detcr-

'rence at the lowest ioroe lcvels consistent
with stability.” McNamara said. He said
that strategic forces of 10 percent oi‘the
currently deployed warheads would reach
this state. and that tactical nuclear forces
could be entirely eliminated “in short. lhe
present inventory oi 50.000 warheads could
be cut to 2.000.” he said.

McNamara added that we must “shed
the beliei that all technological advanccs.
no matter how threatening they are. are
impossible to stop " »

Speaking on the future. McNamara said
that iive to ten years lrom now. smaller
countries would start to demand chairs at
the negotiating table and bring pressure to
bear on the superpowers ‘

And in answering a question about the
diliei-ent goals 01' the u, and the Soviet
Union. McNamara rcpl -l don't know
about goals. but I think in t me the Soviets
might make moves in our direction. They

Finally. the completion ol’ a complete
