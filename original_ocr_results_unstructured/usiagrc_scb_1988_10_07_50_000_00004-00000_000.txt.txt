Grinnell publication attracts
international readership

by Susan Roth
During last semester, the Aller-
native: Journal. a new student
publication founded by 1988
graduate Mark W. Schumann has
made its appearance on the Grin-
nell College Campus Aside
from its political nature, the Al-
ternative: Journal differs from
other publications in that is en-
tirely on tlte compute:

According to Schumann and
Technical Editor Lisa Minogue.
this publication was a "takeoff"
on the currently existing com-
puter bulletin boards. Schumann
said that the principle problem
with the bulletin boards was that
the discussions too easily degenv
erated into nonsense and name-
calling every few days. TheAl~
lernall'ves Journal was therefore
devised to give students an
opportunity to submit essays for
publication three times yearly. no
pseudonyms allowed

The Alternative: Journal is

Language

My friends and I were riding
for five and a half hours on "hard
seats" to Shanghai. The train
ticketvseller had said there were
no "soft seats" left, so therel sat,
determined to make the best of
this "Real China" experience as
opposed to the more comfortable
"Rich Foreigner" experience 1
would have gained on a soft seat

We sat four to a bench. facing
four others with a small table
suspended between us. The seats
would have seemed roomier had it
not been for us big ﬂat g 9 ren
(foreigners) and our long foreign
legs. Our tcet touched the toes of

also more technically advanced
than the bulletin boards. Says
Minogue: "another problem with
the boards is that once you get
staned, you can‘t back up. you
must go to the end, and then start
over. Therefore, Mark and I began
writing BROWSE. a program
that could let the user jump. not
only back and forth between
pages. but also between articles.
BROWSE even has a bookmark
option, and. of course, a help
menu."

The submission and circula-
tion for the Alternative: Journal
have in no way been limited to
Grinnell College. The premier
issue included contributions from
Princeton, Syracuse University,
University of Maine, and
University of Pittsburgh, as well
as Grinnell. At the moment,
anyone who has access to Bitnet.
ArpaNet. etc. may receive the
Alternative: Journal. A version

is also being distributed by the
LisLserve at North Dakota. To
get access to the Alternatives
Journal at Grinnell. a user can

type @[alterpro]info or
@[alterpto]browse.

According to Minogue, the
two principle concerns for the
future of the Alternative: Journal
are ﬁnding a new editor to replace
the retiring Schumann and trying
to rework the account so that it
will be easier for a new editor to
handle. Both of these problems
will be worked on during this
year. The next issues will come
out at the end of October and then
in January. The response to the
Alternatives Journal has thus far
been quite positive, say its edi-
tors. Says Minogue: "There's
been just a huge number of peo-
ple from other schools and other
Bitnet sites (about 40 or 50) who
have subscribed to the list."

 

HRC sponsors lecture
on sexual pressure

by Beth Wodzinski
On Thursday, Oct. 13 in
South Lounge, Dr. Leonard

Felder will give a presentation
entitled "Sexual Pressure: What
Happens When One Partner Says
'Yes' And The Other Says 'No'."
The program is being sponsored
by the Human Resource Center
(HRC).

Felder is a graduate of
Kenyon College in Ohio. He has
written about sexuality. self-es-
teem, and communication for a
wide variety of publications. He
is the author of Making Peace
with your Parents (Random
House 1983), Making Peace with
Yourself (Random House 1985).
and A Fresh Start (New Ameri-
can Library 1987).

The lecture will be about
"how to deal with sexual pressure
and differing sexual feelings be-
tween panhers." Felder will ex-
plore topics such as "how to talk
bout sexual concerns without
spoiling the fun or ruining the
romance of a date," date rape,
how men can "overcome the

pressure to measure their esteem
by how much they 'score'," and
how to be a "healthy sexual per-
son without having to say yes to
anything you don't want."
Grinnellians have high

expectations about the quality of
Felder's program. Steven Jones,
speaking of an appearance Felder
made at Grinnell in November of
1985, said that Felder "captured
the student's hearts with his
mixture of facts, insights and
humor." Glen Brown, a member
of the HRC advisory committee.
said "This is a very relevant is-
sue. and we should all make an
effort to be there." SA Mark Hill
said that attendance at the presen-
tation will count as one of the
two in-services that Student Ad-
visors must attend each semester.
"If the administration puts
enough emphasis on this that it's
an in»service, then you know it‘s
going to be good." said Hill.

The lecture will be followed
by a reception hosted by
Women's Group.

help that there were more
passengers than seats. The aisles
were ﬁlled with luggage and peo-

seatbacks and tried to catch a
breeze from the opened window.

everyone to speak slowly. Talk-
ing with people on a train is as
good as going to class, he tells
me.

He agrees with me that Chi-
nese is an extremely difficult
language. "Too many words." he
says with a sigh and shakes a
magazine with lurid pictures of
cops. frightened women and hun-
gry ghosts on the cover. "Too
difﬁcult to tea ."

"And everyone speaks differ-
ently." he says. "Every area has
its own language. People from
different areas can‘t understand
each other."

I felt relicved. i had thought
it was just me.

"Did you understand when I
spoke to my child just now?" he
asks and pars the little boy sit-
ting on his lap.

I shake my hcad.
