WHERE STUDENTS FAIL

(Editorial Note: This is the second in a. series
of editorials dealing with various phases of student
government. They are written to inform the stu-
dent body of the various duties and qualifications
of the officers whom the students will he called
upon to elect within the next two months. The
third in the series will appear within a short Lime.)

College government at Grinnell must not
be thought of purely as student self-gov-
ernment in which students and faculty are
pitted against each other to see which can
make the most objectionable rules for the
other, but rather it must be considered a
cooperative affair in which each group bene—
fits as does the other and lends itself fairly
to the others advice.

To attain this end, certain student ap-
pointees have for sometime had the duty
of sitting on various college committees on
an equality with faculty members. It is
only as a duty that such membership should
be regarded if an equilibrium of power as
well as interest in campus affairs is to be
maintained.

But in some instances Grinnell students
have not made use of this privilege to the
fullest extent. Student representatives on
committees have considered the meetings
only routine and of little importance to them.
Yet when rules for college government have
been put into effect by these committees,
students have protested. They have label-
led such acts, rulings of a faculty acting in
direct opposition to the welfare of the col-
lege.

But they have done only talking. They
have started no campaign for getting their
own representatives on the committees to
do some actual constructive work in partici—
pation with faculty leaders. The agitation
for a change in the last Christmas vacation
is but one example of this.

In the face of such disinterest, how can
the faculty believe that student desire for
more power in government is sincere?

Cooperative government we must have at
Gn'nnell. It is dictated by the very fact of
the smallness of the school and the atten—
dant principle which stands behind all small
Collegesﬁthat smallness makes possible the
acquaintance with faculty members and
their policies. Only by such cooperation
can be established a spirit of respect on the
part of both groups for each other which
comes from an undersmnding of the place

of each in the entire scheme.

It seems vastly unfair that students
should make any complaint against the fac-
ulty for not giving sufficient power of self-
govcrnment until they are ready to assume
whole-hedl-tedly the responsibilities of gov-

ernment which they now possess.
THE EDITORIAL BOARD

SUPPORT “GRl'NNELL-IN-CHINA“

The students and faculty of Grinnell are
p . vileged to have a part in supporting the
mission school movement in China through
our own school, Gr‘mell-in—China, but few
of us realize Why this work is so important
and, so much appreciated by Chincse leaders.

In modern China, where the mass of the
people are still illiterate, General Chiang
has placed great emphasis on the importance
of education, and as a result thousands of
boys and girls go to government schools

and many of them stand well in the compo» ,

titive examinations recently instituted

These schools however, as General Chiang
himself says, can not take the place of the
mission schools in developing strong char-
acter in the students. So it is to the mis-
sion schools that China is looking for lead»
ers with character as well as intelligence to
lead them to new achievements.

Many will ask why we should furnish
China with leaders? Such an attitude is
like saying that the innocent victims of a
great national catastrophe should take
care of themselves w'thout bothering others.
When most autho 'ties agree that the fu-
ture of our nation will center in the Pacific
it seems obvious that we must be interested
in the development of China if we consider
our own welfare.

Last year in a drive at Carleton college
the students raised $2,200 for a similar
school. Let us join in supporting our own
Grinnel invChind, so that it may continue
to furnish China with leaders. J S

WHY HIRE SPIES'I

The evidence being presented before the
senate civil libel cs committee in the in
quiry into industrial espionage is astound-
ing in its implications. Leaving aside any
question as to the value of the unions it
seems incredible that the heads of such
large organizations as General Motors
would pay a private detective agency $167,»
586 to keep them informed of the presence
of union organizers in their plants ill order
that they might be fired before they could
achieve any results. _

It would seem obvious that such a policy
could only foster imitation and susplclon
among employees thus prQVlding fertile
ground for union sympathy. ~ Perhaps an
equal amount spent in promoting favorable
relations between employer and employees
would more nearly accomplish the desired
result. ' ‘ ‘

This practice is, of course, not limited‘to
General Motors but extends throughout ill-
dustry. The evidence so far presented
shows that railroads, steamship lilies, auto-
mobile companies, mining corporations, and
employers’ associations all make use of spies
to prevent union inﬂuence.

It is possible that the universal develop
ment of co-operation between employer and
employees in industry would do away with
the need for unions and thus eliminate
strikes. Certainly it would be worth trying
since the present policy seems to have fall-

Other Opinions

"The political function of education is to develr
op capacity for leadership and to develop capacity
to choose leaders and to [allow their lead." Dr.
F. H. Knight, professor of cconomics at the Uni-
vers‘ty of California, suggests educational expanr
sion for all participants in the political ”follow
the leader game."

“The'Amerioan dormitory for men is in general
’an abomination beforc the Lorri: There is usually
not a single refining influence Within its walls;
there is not a single redeeming feature about it,
except as a place to hang a hat." Not even the
humdn~hdt racks, Doctor? Doctor Dexter s. Kim-
ball, dean emeritus at Cornell University, speaks
his mind.

 

DORIC

The manager of “The Tanager”
received the following letter short-
ly aitor the last issue of the lit
ary magazine appeared. Feeling
that it had no place in the col—
umns of the mag, he turned ltovcl‘
to Doric and we herewith print it,

“near Manager:

I think that if you are tr-
ing to have crazy poetry in

It is my first contribution
