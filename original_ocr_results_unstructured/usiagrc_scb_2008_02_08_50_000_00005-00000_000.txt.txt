from p' 1 and youth pro-
grams, as well as recreational swimmers, teams
that otherwise would have nowhere to swim
are forced to aeeept unusual and ineonvenient
hours. “The high school
team has to practice for
an hour and 15 minutes
before sehool," Hurley
said.

In addition to the
physical expansion, the
new raellity will also
offer improvements on
the ventilation and en,
ergy consumption ofthe
pool.

“The eurtent pool has a 301132" lire ex?
peetancy, and it's been around for a little bit
more than 30 years," said Hurley. “There are
mechanical issues, sueh as with the ventilation
Systemt"

Asthmatlcs have had problems breathing
while in the facility, espeeially when put under
the athletic strain of competitive swimmingt

In a step towards keeps
ing the environment healthy,
the pool will also be geothere
mally heated. “It’s nice to
have the money to do this,"
said Hurley.

“We won't need outside
energy to warm the pool, and
it will pay back over time,"
The energy for the heating
will come from geothermal
wells in Springer Field, the cuirent site of the
construction next to the Black Culnire Cen—

”We expect to ﬁnish completion
ofthe athletic (enter hymn/lg of

The swimming pool will he eonneeted to
the school's other athletic facilities by an un*
dcrgl‘ound wallwny so that patrons ean easily
move between the struetnres during melement
weather. Athletes W|l.l be able
to travel seamlessly from one
activity or another without
ever having to step outside.

The seeond mnjat com»
ponent of the expansion is
a lZSOOOrsquarcefoot fields
house which will line the
sidelines of the football field.
The inside of the fieldliousc
will resemble the PEC gym,
except it Will be much larger.

The stiuctuie \’V|l.l house four tennis courts
and a 200'metcr track, with space for several
events at once.

Along the side of the building, an open
loggla will face the football ﬁeld from which
fans may view home football games. Racquctr
ball courts and a set ofnew athletic ofﬁces will
occupy the area between Darby and the new
ﬁeldhouse. The Phase
ll facilities largely make
the PEC iediindant, and
there are plans to replace
the FEC with a parking
ot or more green space,

while the completion
of the new athletic center
is far in the futulexxcitv
ment is growing alt dy.
“I‘ve looked at the plans,"
said Ben Schcmper ’11. “I’m pumped {oi the
new showers."

But consider this a“love you” card (from us).
