Concert in Chapel Tuesday Introduces
New Type of Band Music to Grinnell

Director Williams Presents
Modem Symphonic

Arrangements

By RITA Films

The Grinnell College Concert band,
under the direction oi Chester Wil.
liams, introduced an entirely new style
oi band music to Grinnell music lov.
cis in its unusual and diiiicult p-
gram presented last night in Kerrie
chapel.

To those who had previously asso.
ciated band music with only the blar.
ing brassos and the march rhythm oi
a military band, the quality at the
music heard last night was a delight.
hi1 surprise. The selections held little
similarity to those heard on summer-
nights in the city square, resembling
much more closely the intricate hum.
bets oiiered on symphony programs.

Only One March

The opening selection “restal Day"
by lsuchtel, was the only march time
selection on the program. it was
played with zest and gusto appropriate
to popular marches and served as an
interesting contrast to make the more
complicated numbers oi the rest oi the
program even more impressive.

The iirst movement at Fauchet's
“Symphony in a ﬂat” was next oi.
icred. This piece showed the true
posibilities oi a band in rendering sym.
phonic arrangements in the absence oi
a violin section, and was exceptionally
well played. Although not so heavy
as some oi the more iamiliar sym.
phonic works, it brought out the
solo instruments to excellent advent.
age.

Modern ithopsody Ploases
Perhaps the most appealing number
on the program, so iar as the audience
was concerned, was Colby‘s modern
rhapsody, “Headlines." It was in.
teresting, ﬂeshy and light, and reveal.
ed a marked similarity to the Gersh.

Government association board, con.

Stoops Presents
Talk at Vesper
Service Sunday

“There is growing up in the world a
new conception of God, a new con.
ception oi religion," declared Dr. J.
D. Stoops, proicssor oi philosophy, in
his address at Vespers Sunday aitcr.
noon. in developing this idea he pro.
ceded to explain that the theology oi
the christian church has really been
the same as that oi Plato.

in the old conception, God was an
infinite, changcless, eternal mind that
existed back oi the world and back
oi all nature, the speaker stated. and
people held by one oi two conceptions
oi the creation. Either God made the
world out oi nothing, or else God
iound irom all eternity a material stuii
and “did the best He could to make
a world out oi it.”

Dr. Stoops pointed out that ”our
iaith and conception of Truth corre.
sponds to somcthing which is already
themalready completed." ideas are
not imitative, he insisted. “Ideas are
original and serve to give us more
power in organizing lite."

“Ballet," he continued, “consists in
having onough confidence in your
ideas to work ior them."

Modern college students have not
ceased to be interested in religion, the
speaker declared, but rather in trad.
itionalrintellectual views. One can

disagree with the teachings oi th New
Testament, he asserted.
