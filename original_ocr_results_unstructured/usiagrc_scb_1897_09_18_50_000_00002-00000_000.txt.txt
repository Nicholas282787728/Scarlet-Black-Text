WE WISH to call the attention
of the students to the necessity of
keeping the gymnasium open this
school year.
committee of the Y. M. C. A. have
decided that they cannot open
the gymnasium unless’tliey receive
enough pledges to insure the ace
ual running expenses. The Y. M.
C. A. does not intend to make
money out oi the gymnasium but
it the expenses are not met by
admission fees the members of
the i‘z. M. C. A. must pay {or the
deﬁcit out of their own pockets.
The gymnasium is an absolute
necessity to the success of our
athletic teams, so it is to be hoped
that the committee will meet with
every success in their efforts to
secure pledges. The Y. M. C. A
are repairing the lockers and ﬁxs
ing up the bath rooms so that the
membersmayreceiyealltheheno

The Subscription Concert Series.

We are very sorry to learn that
Prof. Cole is experiencing some
difﬁculty in securing the 400 sub-
scribers necessary to insure the
ﬁnancial success of his concert
series for the coming year. This
is not as it should be. Last year’s
series was the equal of any given
anywhere in this country and the
arrangements tor this year give
promise of a course otcven gieah
er merit. on Oct. 29 Clarence
Eddy, the world famous otgzmist,
will give the ﬁrst concert of the
series. To anyone at all interest-
ed in music this name alone is a
sufﬁcient recommendation. The
second concert will be on Dec. 17
by the Spicring String Quartet
winch recerreri so hearty a wels
come in the series last year. Tlrrs
is one oi the very few really ex-
cellent quartets in America and
is absolutely the only one in reach
at the people of the West. The
third and last concert cannot at
present he deﬁnitely announced.
It will, however, be given by a
pianist and a vocalist. both artists

date will be sometime after the
holidays. This is no money malt-
ingseherne Proi. Cole is otter-
mg the best that can be secured
and simply asks that the major
part oithe expense incurred be
guaranteed in advance. He is
