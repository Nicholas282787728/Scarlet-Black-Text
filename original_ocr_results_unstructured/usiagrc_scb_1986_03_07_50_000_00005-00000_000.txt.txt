The Heart of the Dragon

by kerry wickham

Americans are generally very curious
about China and the Chinese, and the
Chinese are even more curious about
America and Americans. Chinese percep»
tions of us, and ours of them, are full of
misunderstandings, exaggerations, and
oversimplifications. But the Chinese peo-
ple thatI met during my five month stay in
the People’s Republic were generally bet»
ter informed about the United States then
most of the Americans I know are inform-
ed about China.

I became aware of Chinese mis'conceir
tions of the U.S. mostly through questions
that Chinese people asked me. When
Americans in China meet Chinese people
the first questions they are asked often
concern money: “What does your father
do? Does he have a lotot money? Did your
parents pay for you to come to China? Do
they pay for you to go to college? (Chinese
people often have the impression that, in
America, only students whose parents are
wealthy enough to pay $12,000 a year in tulr
tion can go to college) . . . Do you have a
car?”, etc.

Before I went to China, I was told to ex-
pect questions like these and l was assured
that they are not rude questions in China.
The questioner does not want to know that
you are rich so she or he can resent you,
one of my Chinese teachers told me, they
are simply curious 7 and if you have a lot
ofmoney, they will simply say that you are
lucky. By Chinese standards, nearly all
Americans are rich. But Chinese people
often believe that all Americans are as
wealthy as those in American movies.

Movies also contribute to another com-
mon misconception. Considering the type
of American movies mat for some reason
are chosen to be shown in China, (both
Rambo and Superman were shown during
my stay), it is not surprising that the

Chinese have an exaggerated picture of
the amount of violence in our country.

We all know that there is a lot of violence
in the United States, and violent crime in
China seems to be almost nonexistent (the
reason for that is another story), but some
of the questions I was asked on this subject
shocked me. For example, one Chinese
friend that I had known for a few hours
asked me, completely out of context,
“Does everyone in your country carry a
gun?”

Americans, too, tend to have an over
simplified view of the Vast and come
plicated country of China. In order to give
the reader some idea of China‘s lack of
homogeneity, 1 will brietly describe two
short trips that I made to other cities in
China from my home base in Nanjing, a cir
ty of about four million people on the
Yangtze River.

I studied in China on a program of the
Council on International Educational Ex-
(CIEE), and CIEE planned
several trips and activities for the twenty
two American students on ﬁle program.
On most weekends, however, we were free
to travel on our own. One weekend I
travelled wim Kate Chang, my roommate
(the other Grinnell student on the pro-
gram), and my Chinese lriend, Kejiu, to
the town of Xuzhou, about a six hour train
ride from Nanjing.

Kejiu had used a “connection" to get
three tickew for the train we wanted, but
we did not have seat assignments. Our
tickets simply gained us entrance to the
“hard seat” section, and the cars of that
type are generally packed full of people,
half or more of whom do not have seats.

Tickets in this section on this particular
route cost about in kuai, or $3.00 U.S. Third
class on Chinese trains is called “soft
seat”, and tickets in this section are about
twice the price of “hard seat" tickets. For
twice the price of “soft seats”, “hard
berth” tickets are available. and again, [or
twice the price of “hard berth”, there is
“soft berth", which is truly luxury class.

After boarding the train that Friday
alternoon, Kate and I found a place on the
floor between train cars and began m
make ourselves comfortable, chatting
with the Chinese men we shared our space
with and trying to politely retuse the
filterless Chinese cigarettes they offered.
Kejlu was determined that we would not
sit on the floor so he took off as soon as the
train started and ran around trying to find
us a place to sit. Half an hour later he
returned and brought us to the “hard
berth" section of the train, where we salon
the ends of two berths for the rest of the
trip,

The town of Xuzhou was a “semi-open"
City, which means that foreigners can go
there only with special permits. wnen
Kate and [arrived at Xuzhou’s new school
of mining technology, where Kejiu's
brother (who lives in Xuzhou) had arrang-
ed for us to slay, the wcibzn (ioreigner of-
ﬁce) representative was sent for imr
mediately. She asked us for our permits.
which we did not have, For a few minutes I
panicked, thinking that we would be sent
directly back to Nanjing, and 1 worried
that we would be stuck in the train station
without tickets. Soon, however, she decidr
ed that we could stay through Sunday, and
she began to ask us questions about
ourselves.

As the person in charge of dealing with
foreigners in a town which foreigners rare-
1y visit, she seemed quite pleased to have a
chance to do her job. The rest of her time,
apparently, was spent entertaining and
helping the five foreigners who live in
Xuzhou working as teachers at the mining
institute. Three of those teachers were
Americans, and one of them was informed
of our arrival so she could take advantage
of the rare opportunity to speak with other
Americans.

Many times, as soon as people find out
that I am from China, their first response
is “It must be so different here from
China." I often think the same thing
myself. Here are some of the anecdotes of
my experiences to explain why.

I expected the U.S. to be a totally exotic
place for me. But one of my most
memorable experiences occurred during
one of my first “American meals" when l
was staying with a family. I had noodla
mixed with tomato sauce. I was jubilant
and exclaimed, “Oh, Grandma's ‘mein!’
You are so considerate.” But I was cor-
rected immediately that this is an Italian
dish which people here call “spaghetti.”

Now, i am not trying to dispute the
legitimacy of Marco Polo's right to borrow
the Chinese Mein nor do I wishvto deprive
the Italian people of me pride for inventing
something beyond pizza. But the simple
fact is that grandma was ”born in the
P.R.C.” and has never been to Sicily. In
fact, what people call spaghetti here is a
very popular dish in Shansi province.
where grandma was born and raised.

Although this spaghetti business is a
coincidence, it nevertheless cautioned me
that the U.S. would not be as radically dif-
ferent as I had expected.

On the omer hand, the expectation also
comes from the host. During the first few
weeks after I came here, my twelve-year
old cousin came to my room, and as usual I
didn't happen to have had the time to make
my bed.

instead of giving me a hard time, Greg
said enthusiastically, “Do you want to
make your bed the ‘American way’C’”

At the time, 1 was very anxious to pick
up any elements of “‘the American

‘ culture.” So I accepted the offer rather
gratefully. 1 observed the demonstration
with my full attention but became im-
mensely disappointed as soon as he was
finished: ﬂatten your bottom sheet, [old

the blanket, and put it at the end of the bed
if it looks nice. What is so extraordinary
about that? It is exacﬂy what I would do
tool

I am not criticizing Greg for assuming
people make beds in China differently. In
fact, 1 appreciated his willingness to help
me catch up with what he perceived as an
entirely different culture for me. However,
this does make a point: the host culture
often ”links that everything must be so dif-
ferent, even moss matters of common
sense.

Furthermore, 1 was very self—conscious
about my ability to fit in here, 1 wanted to
do everything the way people here would,
as the bedrmaking incident showed. This
desire became a burden sometimes as it is
impossible to do everything the way most
people consider as “normal."

I still remember the time when I went
out to the International House of Pancakes
with my relatives. I ordered pancakes with
Coke, This combination not only drew
laughter from my cousins but made the
waitress raise her eyebrows a bit. You
couldn’t believe how embarassed I felt for
doing something so “uh-American."

So my own desire to mingle with the
culture was, and still is, a pressure on
myself, (By the way, 1 have seen combina
tions that are far more outrageous than
Coke with pancakes here at Grinnell.)

or course, my years here in the us.
have not been merely a series of dismayed
expectations both from people here and
myself. Still, I have found from time to
time that there are differences, “cultural-
ly speaking,” which can be obstacles.

I was taught as a child to always cons
sider people’s feelings. If the person is
“goodintentioned”, you should try
everything possible to fulfill their request.
As a result, I felt obligated to say “yes”
when asked to go to a movie even if I had
