Scarlet & Black

 

by Eric B. Lusk

The coaches of Grinnell College's cross
country running teams were pleased with
their overall periormance.

The coach or the women's team, Evelyn
Freeman. led her runners to the second
Conierence Championship in her four year
coaching career. Competing against better
teams than at the Conference meet in the
Regional Championship in Decorah, Iowa,
on Novembei: 12, the women placed
eleventh out of seventeen Freeman said
she was not disappointed with the Decorah
race

Freeman was prepared tor the season.
This year she had most 01' her runners
from last year, she had more people to
choose irom, and she gained two line runr
ners with Jennifer Bishop and Shavaun
Adams (the two were the Rookie Runners
ot the Year, Bishop managed the award
despite a mid-season appendectomy
operationl. Freeman also continued her
weight training program [or the team.
which included plyometric exercises

The Regionals was mlsrepresenlatlve ot
the feeling the team had of the season, Said
Adams, "I‘ve never been on a Winning
team before " Adams was enthusiastic
about next year's prospects

The womans' crossrcounti-y team has
cause [or such optimism. The only depara
ting senior will be corcaptain Barbara
Elias, The team Will retain Co~captain Sue
Durkee, Most Valuable Runner Andrea
Straight, and Most Improved Runner

Mary Gardener. As Coach Freeman said,
"We can't wait for next year.

The men‘s cross-country team was not
as successful but Coach Ray Obermiller
was pleased anyway. The team was
without veteran Steve Harrold because of
a pelvic injury, and without other veterans
who left early in the year. Obcrmiller telt
the team lacked the necessary experience
with three treshmen, three sophomores
and two juniors.

Obermiller was not d appointed with
the team's periormance. “Ten years ago
this would have been a very good team.
The number or really good longdisiance
runners in this country is phenomenal "
Given the lack of experienced personnel,
Obermiller said "We did well considering
the misfortunes. '

Considering the competition Obermiller
would have a good pomt, Three of the
teams that Grinnell ran against in the
Regional meet on November 12 (Grinnell
iinished lastl consistently placed in the top
live spots in the National meet

Obermiller plans to continue his water
training into next year. At the end at each
practice this season, the athletes would
run in the pool. He noted that when he stop»
ped the pool work at the end of the season,
the injuries rose dramatically.

Coach Obermiller remains hopeful about
next season. He will have the same team
back, including team captain John Abel
lwinner of the Dick Gilbert Leadership
Award and the MVP award), Most Im-
proved Runner Jim Rasmussen, and Most
Valuable Freshman Andy Huestis
