quirement for graduation in many
colleges, and this has resulted in
stimulating student activity, since it
promotes comradeship of teacher and
pupil in the mastery of a field of
common interest,”

To Post Readings

“Such examinations will be given
in Crinnell in the spring of 193i,"
stated Professor Conard, “and sever-
al preparatory steps are leading in
that direction: first, the reading pe»
riod: second, the approaching com-
prehensive examinations; third, the
system of collateral readings in prep-
aration for the major tests, and
fourth, a system of conference or
survey classes for seniors in each de:
partment to aid in organizing and
unifying their work."

Mr, Conard stated that lists of
readings for each department will be
posted before the end of the present
semester. and he explained that much
of this reading might be done dur-
ing the summer.

"The whole plan is an attempt to
give freedom and incentive to the
intellectual life of the college," said
Mr. Conard in closing. "and many
details remain to be worked out by
students and faculty in constant ad-
visory relation,”
