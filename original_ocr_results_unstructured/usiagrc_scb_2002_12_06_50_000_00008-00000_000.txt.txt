Students speak out
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words, and you‘re
invited! It you have
a random rant, Email
it lo me at
alwardnggrinnelledu
After all, complain-
ing in a public forum
is always more fun
than daing it alone._

This is to the people who keep trashing Rawsan
kitchen and stealing the food in there. STOP. This
time, you even broke my toaster by getting
dishwashing liquid in it. MV dishwashing liquid. I still
haven’t decided whether you die just MORONS o. ma-
licious little drunken ﬁends. I’m nut the only one who
suffers from petty theft and damage, but 1 have to
say, it’s been consistent every week. What have I done
to you to deserve this? What has the RawSDn clean-
ing start done to deserve this? And whatever hapr
pened to self-governance?! Its more than just a hoe
ticket to get however drunk you want, you know.

The frozen man

Ijust want it to be warm! No, not outside, in my
room! It's bad enough that I have to wear my gloves,
jacket, and hat in my chemistry seminar roam; why
can’t I at least have enough heat to sleep comfortably
in sweats and three blankets? I KNOW other people
get heat; my room last year was 5a hot that I kept
both windows open and even turned on my fans some
wintiy days! Can whoever has that excessive heat in
their room this year please share some of it with me?

To make matters worse, 21 bunch 01’ iriends told me

'Ehat there was a "valve" on the south campus heaters

that you could turn minutes. ,n... he‘t. After much
searching, Ifound somethinn 'csmiblng a valve, but
when [turned it, instead of lien! inns of dirty Water
rushed nut. If you know what I Should have done with
that valve, please call me and help me out... I’ll buy
you something nice and warm, like a hot chocolate.

Show your love with tapes, not (05

How many of us have known the pleasure of a
real, bunaﬁde mix~tape? No, not a cheap-ass mix
CD. The real deal, with a clever title and side names
drawn from rocking songs, Being in possession or
more than a dozen, I must speak on their behalf.
Mix-tapes, unlike niix CD5, cannot be mass-produced,
and must he made with love, care, and thought, as
well as a collection of tapes, CDs, mp3: and vinyl.
Furthermore, cassette tapes give off warm fuzzy noise
instead or brash eloetmnie pain, they remind us or
our childhood, they come in cute little boxes, and
dammit they don't skip, They have an ai. or
friendliness and nostalgia that lateraudi’o technology
is deﬁnitely lacking.

50 next time you want to Show someone your
love, say it with an emotionally moving cassette
tape, instead of a gold, heartless compact disc. 1'...

quite serious. ——E‘milia Garvey ‘06
