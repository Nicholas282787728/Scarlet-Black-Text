Siuclen’r Council Hears Ways

To Increase S+u

The Student Council Wednc
day night heard possible ways
to inelease student influence in
College decisions but did nut1
think that any action was neCr
essary, at least tor the prcsont1
times

Gary Thurston of the Stu-
(lent-laculty Relations commit-
tee reported two ways that
President Howard R. Bowen
has said that student particle
pation might be expanded.

Students could he representq
ed on more faculty Committees. 1
They are now on three: Publicl
Events, international Studtesl
and Student Publications. 1

The second possibility, and
that which Bowen thought more1
ieasiblc, was having Studentl
Council establish committees
palallel to those of the faculty.

Thurston said that according
to Bowen it would be impos
sihle tor students to be on the
Executive Council and quite
difficult tor them to belong to
most of the other faculty com
mittees.

“I surely question," Thurs- 1
ton added, “whether we want =
standing committees to do the
same thing that those iaculty
committees are doing." Stu. 1
dents do not have enough 1‘
time to man that many more 1
committees, he said.

Acco1d1ng to 111m. many at:
