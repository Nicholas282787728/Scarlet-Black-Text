“The American colleges and
iiniversitics can be the most
powerful single source for sanity
and vontiiresomcncss, for shap-
iiig literary and writing tastes
away from the jargenistic. the
sin-realistic, and the irresponsible,"
said John ciardi in the opening
lecture or the third annual Grmr
iiell coollege W’riloxs’ conici-ence
last Friday night in Main dran
ing room.

He termed the theory that col»
legcs are a bad environment for
creative writing “a romantic no-
Lloll." Ciari said, “The writer
who really ivants to write will
ﬁnd subjects wherever he is.”

The Bl'iggsVCDpclal-ld assistant
professor at Harvard and widely
published poet said: "The kind of
art I value has alivays come
from a notion of craftsmanship."
That’s where the colleges should
do their part, he believes. He
urged the formation of a travel-

never permitting the writing
courses to stagiiate. “Writing not
only can be learned, but it must
be learned," he said.

Speaking about college writing
courses, Maxiin Lieber, New York
literary agent, said, “Personally,
I have never met a graduate of
such a course who ever amounted
to a hill of beans."

At the Saturday morning
round table held at in in ARH

lishing business, showing how
they are now divorced.
tunately," he said, “business has
taken control of culture. The
writer must resign himself to
ivriting the superficial, rather
than the profound if he wishes
to sell.”

Professor Louis Cazamian spoke
before the conference Saturday

afternoon in Main drawing room'

on “Why Critics?" “Explaining
is the field of the critic now,"
he said. “The literary level ivill
not rise above the best sellers
until it is evident that the pub-
lic has outgrown them,” he com-
inentcd.

Cazaniian discusscd the various
types of criticism. The critics
who judge and those who elassr

fy were discredited as no longer,

performing the true function of
a critic. in his role as explainer.
the critic can probe “the ob-
scurities of modern literature so
that the public is not deceived.“
Cazamian said, “The critics prop-
er work is to film a book and
give us a negative print of it.”
