A GREAT VICTORY

Last night’s victory over Cornell
was prooi that Gl‘lmlell‘s basketball
spirit is not dead. Tire scarlet quintet
went into the game determined to de-
teat their larger and more experienced
opponents. They were enthusiasticah
1y supported from the ﬁrst second run
til the last by the entire Gi-innell
crowd

Basketball spirit is necessary it rve
are to have basketball, regardless of
war conditions. Last night's game was
won by that spirit which iii the army
is called “morale."

The men on the team deserve great
praise ior their work last night. They
have upheld Grinnell's basketball
standing in the state, And every man
and woman at the game can teel an in—
ward satistactiou for having a part, if
only a small part, in bringing victory
to Griirnell.

’l'llE HELP G KICK

(From the Univ. of ll'asliiitatou llaily)

Once there was a basketball team.
rhis basketball team was having a
great deal of trouble to develop it-,
self. It hadn't any really exporicnccdl
men on it, at least rrot in comparison'
to the men who rverc to play against
it.

This team also had a good coach.
He knew basketball. and he knew men,
Bill. he didn't have the material to turn
out a championship quintet.

Nobody appreciated the situation
more than the men. Nobody knew the
handicap any better than the coach.
However, the coach but in long hou
coaching, and the players worked
themselves to exhaustion, playing.
There was another iactor~the rneiil
were students at a great nnivei
The athletic record or the llnir'e’ '
rested with them, and they knew it.

At. last came the time for the ﬁrst
intercollegiate contests. The men had
worked hard. The coach had worked
hard. They went on the ﬂoor it 1th a
determination to ﬁght, There was a
small crowd to watch them play.

But when the whistle blew some-
thing went wrong with the crowd, In-
stead oi cheering, they knocked. Ins
stead ot crediting the ﬁve with the
struggle they were making, the crowd
jcercd. Their opponents heard the
criticisms. The criticisms didn't help
the ﬁghting spirit of the home team
airy. Both games were lost.

But the coach and the men came
back trv' c as hard at the next prac-
tice. F ery titan jumped into the game.
They made rip their iniud to improve.
even it the scoreboard wasn't favor
able.

Now, the story ends right there. The
season had iast started. How about
the attitude the students took? Did
they—do thuyidcsel've a winning
team?
