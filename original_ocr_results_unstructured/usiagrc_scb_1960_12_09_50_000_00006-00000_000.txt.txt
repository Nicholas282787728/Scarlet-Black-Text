To the Editor: ;

The exhibition of representa
tire government displayed at the
Dec. 7 (truly “a day or infamy")
meeting of the Student Council
was quite a disquieting experi—
ence. I rerer to the selection oii
Mr. Silipley's “flamingo" dance
er.s over one Count Basic for the
second semester concert The
abortive vote was 23.5. i

As is evident. had 1 voted lI
would have cast my ballot for
Count Basie. That, however, is
unimportant for the vote of the
Council was decisive, Rather,
the objection is to the inaiinei-i
in which the Spanish dancers
were pushed, or should i say
railroadcd, through.

The Social Coordinator’s pcr .
sonal choice was as clear as my
own is here. He dismissed the
jazz orchestra as something.
“we’ve all heard or" and pro.
cceded to .scll the idea ot the
Spanish group to the council
month And then we were
told the comparative prices ot
the groups and were shown how
niuch money ‘could be saved by
watching the dancers And be—

question. What is important is
tha those who are footing a
sizeable bill tor the concert

,have not had their rightful voice

John E. Carter

To the Editor:
The report of the Disarma—

ment study group was a very‘

fine short story. i have a tow

,niajor corrections to make be.

[are I can consider it news.

1. “Student members of the

group, headed by Dick Mullinsi

and Naida Tushnet, . As far
as I’m aware the co-chairmon
of the study group are Bob Pois
and myself, But then, it you

read it in the 8&3 it must be»

true, so I’m probably wrong.

2. The paragraph went on to
li_st a number of the “beliefs”
of the group First of all, the
group includes people with all

surts of beliefs on disarinamollt,.

and there has or yct been no
attempt to reach a consensus.

‘Tliis will he done when we have‘
more knowledge,

and the
pose is more to give us direc
tion than anything,

Secondly, at the iirst meeting
there was a very generalized
discussion of the arms race, and

the Second was virtually a sum-‘

inary of plans so far presented
by the 111310)‘ powers and the
neutral nations. The only opin

week’s meeting were
