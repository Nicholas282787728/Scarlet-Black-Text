MAIN ELECTED PRESIDENT.

The Dean of Iowa College is chosen
Chief Executive of the Sm:
Teachevs’ Assncinrion.

At the annual meeting of the State
Teacher's Association held at Des
Moines last week, Dean J. H. T.
Main was unanimously chosen to head
the association for the ensuing year.
The action of the association was en-
cirely voluntary as no eaort was made
by the Dean’s friends to push his Can-
diducy. No other candidates appear-
ed and Dean Main was the single
choice of the entire association, num<
bering about twelve hundred teachers
and instructors. It was a glowing
tribute to Dean Mains’s reputation as
an educator and shows that his abili-
ities are being recognized over tile
state at large. Iowa College is proud
to number among her faculty a man
of so broad and thorough scholarship
and as eminent an educator as Dean
Mail]. This is not the ﬁrst time that
the college has been honored by having
a member of the faculty chosen presi-
dent, as Prolessor Parker and Profes-
sor Buck have both held that position,

The College was also represented by
other members of the faculty and by
some of the alumni. Professor .7. P.
Ryan took a prominent part as presi-
dent cithe Public Speaking Section.
Professor Wr J. Rusk read a. paper be
fore the Mathematical section, and
principal Earn spoke before the Nor-
mal and Secondary Department. I’m-
fessor Frank I. Herriott, ’91, of Des
liloines gave one of the most interest-
ing papers of the session on the subs
iect, “The Future of the University
in the Middle West.” Superintend-
ent E. ‘V. Fellows, ’95, of Clarion at-
tracted attention by his defense of
football in reply to the attack made
by S. K. Stevenson of Iowa City
against the game. R. S. Whitley, ’00,
of Ida Grove was chairman of the en-
rolling committee, and r. E. Palmer,
’88 of .leii'erson presided at the Emma
tional Council meeting. Dean Main
gave the opening address before the
College section, extracts from which
we publish below. His subject was,

‘ ”The Problem of the Independent
College.”

“The ﬁrst essential new is that the
institution claiming to be a college
should be a college in fact,

“Three criteria. which have grown
out of existing educationaloonditions,
have been mentioned as the normal
units of measurement in determining
college values. Democracy in the col-
lege is assumed as a matcer of course,
but there is still room l‘ar advance-
ment and enlargement in that direc~
tion.

“The second criterion named is the

adequacy of equipment. Under this
head will come books, apparatus, and
buildings 10: general and special pur-

poses with suitableequipment in each

THE_MccoWAN LECTURE,

”Kings and Queens; Crowned and Un-
crowned,H the Subjccr ol'a Mosl
lnreresring Address.

On December 19, a representative
audience of college and townspeople
gathered in [he Congregational
church to Welcome one of Iowa. Col-
lege’s most talented sons, Mr. Hervey
Smith McGowan, ")3. The theme of
the address was the value of an idea.
We are indebted to the Herald for the
following account:

Mr. McGowan labored undera dis-
advantage which was, however, a
greater inconvenience to himself than
annoyance to the audience. He was
very hoarse and was frequently com-
pelled to pause on this account. This
is the Second time Mr. McGowan has
appeared on the platform here since
his graduation and this number of the
course was given wholly Without com-
peneation.

Mr. McGowan began by paying a
tribute to Iowa. College for the influ-
ence it had had on his life and charac-
ter, second only IA) that of his saluted
mother. Tile ideals toward which
the students :cf the college are con-

stantly directed tend to take their

minds olI the mere matter of gaining
riches and turn them to the develop-
ment ofcharacterr Character, after
all, is the only thing worth striving
for. The ideal is the stimulus to
character building.

The speaker illustrated this thought
by a wealth of illustrations and hum-
orous and pathetic stories. and {or an
hour and a half kept his audience in
tensely interested.

Some lectures cannot be produced
on printed page; they have to be
heard to be understood and appreciat'
ed. This one was of that kind. The
Speaker spclrevery rapidly and drew
such vivid pictures of the scenes
which he chose for his illustrations
that. everything vanished train the
mind save the imagination which
took up the pictures presented and
wave into them other scenes and new
elements until recalled by some other
picture drawn by thespeuker. Tile
closing portion of the address was the
story 01 the lii'eof Jean Valjean, the
Well known character created by Vic-
tor Hugo in Les Miserables, and a
beautiful Word painting of the life
and mission, and ideals, of the lowly
Nazarene.

itself enough of a recommendation.

Music Receives Recogniricn for His
Musical Abilily,

The many friends of Mr, John Ross
Framplon, of the Grinnell School oi
Music faculty, will be pleased to hear
of his latest success in the musical
world. During the past year Mr.
Frampton has been studying harmon-
ic analysis under Dr. Benjamincutter,
of the New England Conservatory of
Music, of Boston. Recently Mr.
Frampton received a letter stating
Dr. Cutter has been Ordered by his phy-
sician to take a six months’ rest, and
asking if Mr. Frampton would carry
on his work during the iormer’s ab-
sence.

The honor is a high one when we
consider that Di: Cutter is recognized
universally as being one of the great-
est teachers of harmony in this coun-
try, [it the New England Conserva-
tory, harmonic analysis is senior re»
quired work and last year Dr. Cutter’s
classes numbered about one hundred
and ﬁlty pupils out of a total of twen-
ty-eight hundred. Dr. Cutter has fre'
quently complimented Mr. Fralnpton
On his excellent work and in his letter
stated that there were only a few men
in this Country who he felt were Com-
petent to carry on his class wox .
The Offer, of course, is not in the [13.7
ture of a formal call, yet it is a source
of gratiﬁcation to Mr. Frampton‘s
many friends that his musical abilities
should be so highly recognized.

Owing to his work at Grinnell, Mr.
Frampton Will be unable to accept the
Offer and Grinnell students rejoice
that they will still have the opportu-
nity of enjoying some more of Mr.
Frampton’s playing. During the two
years that Mr. Fralnpton has been
connected with the Gi‘innell School of
Music, he has won an enviable reputa-
tion, both as a talented musician and
us a popular instructor. Ills recitals
in the School of Music Courses have
been among the most enjoyable num-
bers of the series, and it is a matter of
congratulation that Grinnell School of
Music should have an artist of so great
promise as Mrl Frampton.
