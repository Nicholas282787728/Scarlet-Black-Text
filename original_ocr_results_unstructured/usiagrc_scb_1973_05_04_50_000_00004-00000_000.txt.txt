A Question
Of Security

A student security force will begin patrolling the Campus
tonight, in an effort to solve some of the problems involving
thefts and vandalism now facing Grinnell.

Security has been a major concern at Grinnell for almost
two months. It is sad that this is so, since Grinnell was only
recently listed as among the nation‘s safest and most pleasant
places in which to live.

But crime is rising on college campuses across theynation,
and Grinnell is seemingly not immune. Part of the present
problem is the very openness ofwhich this campus is so proud.

However, it has become clear that something must change.
in the past week, there has been a theft, a major act of van—
dalism, and numerous other smaller problems of which no
real notice has been taken. A group of women students asked
for help, because they were afraid. The Trustees have asked
for a full report on security at their June meeting.

80, the idea of a student run security patrol was developed.
There has been considerable controversy about whether or not
this is the answer, but we feel that it is at least a step in the
right direction.

Securing the campus of this size, given the nature of the
student body, is a difficult task at best. It became clear
during various forums on the security issue that a uniformed,
professional security force would simply not be tolerated
by the majority of students. Protection by city police was an
even more unpopular suggestion.

No real objections to the idea of a student force have been
raised. But, those responsible for campus safety -- Physical
Plant Director Dale Hawn, Dean of Student Affairs Conney
Kimbo, and several other interested individuals have expressed
concern over the effectiveness of such a force.

Dale Hawn summed it up best when he noted that, "if the
people of this campus want security, they must be willing
to cooperate with whatever security system is developed.”

To date, that cooperation has not been evident. There were
student complaints that doors on campus were not being
locked early enough -- yet anyone walking along a loggia late
at night can testify that many doors are purposely propped
open with chairs or rugs.

Many students have complained about the number of “stran»
gers” who are wandering about on the campus “causing troub—
le”. Yet, when a night watchman challenged an unregistered
guest early one morning, he was given a scathing lecture by
the person’s host for “butting in where he didn‘tbelong”.

Clearly; the student security patrol will be simply another
failure, unless the members of the campus community agree
to unite behind it and cooperate with the very modest demands
it will make on the average student.

Considering the concern about thefts of personal property,
most students should be carrying their room keys anyway.
Therefore, the fact that residence hall doors will be locked
and checked regularly on weekends should pose no real prob-
lem.

For those who have misplaced their keys, the college ID
card will serve as well. And no one should resent being asked
to show it. After all, it is for the benefit of each student that
precaution will be taken. A night watchman did not take this
precaution one morning at Norris Hall —~ and the hall residents
lost $25.00 while gaining several frightened students. Hopefully,
the pressure of student opinion will not force some member
of the student patrol into a similar situation.

The question of security is really nothing more than a question
of how much of a community Grinnell really is. If we are a
community, then we will cooperate with the security measures
now being taken for our benefit.

We hope there will be campus cooperation. Because, coupled
with an increased awareness of security‘and a sense of respon—
sibility for the others living with us, cooperation with the newly
inaugurated patrol could solve our present security problem
before it becomes serious.

To the Editors:

I recently turned to read the 55:5
funnies (letters) only to discover
that it had become a'race war
battlefield, Since the time has come
to stand up and be counted, I must
now declare myself a racistﬁa
human racist. i am in full agree
ment with my dog in her convicr
tion that there are too many hu-
mans in Grinnell. You can't walk
across campus anymore without
stepping in their cultural and In-
tellectual feces.

There are no problems existing on
this Campus that could not be alien
viated by eliminating about 1250 stu~
dents, 200 faculty, and assorted adr
ministrators. If this ideal could be
realized, Glenn and l would be free
to sit around with a case of wine
and numerous squirrels and get
down to some hard-core scholastic
endeavor. Two or three times a
year we could get high withthetrus-
tees and solicit ”research funding”
(a euphemism for intellectual pane
handling).

Such meetings represent the pur
pose of my letter. Iwishtoannounce

Halsey: Use

To the Editors:

This letter is to express my con-
cern over this college's policy of
hiring, annually, aprofessionalpho-
tographer to take picutres for fur
ture publications.

In my opinion, this is a tremen-
dous waste of college funds for a
service which could readily be
performed by the college itself.
(1 am familiar with professional
photographers and their rates, and
can assure you that they do not
come cheaply.)

indeed, the yearbook for l973 has
been sent to the printers and there
are approximately 500 photographs
of campus life sitting in the Cyclone
offices in the Forum, any of which
could be used “in future publica»
tions” of the college, ‘

Furthermore, these photographs
were taken by photographers who
are quite capable of professional
quality work in making and proA
cessing negatives and prints. Gr-
anted, the college may not want to
use photographs which have app»
eared in other school publications.

However, i am sure that, through
careful selection, the college could
select one from the dozen or so

Candidacy

Board of Trustees of Grinnell Col—
lege The board presently lacks the
representation of mediocrity and
students and I feel more than qual-
ified to offer such representation.

As a Trustee of the College, my
first project would be to remove
all oi those disgusting lollipop lights
from the campus. Afterahardeven-
ing of book and beer, a man can’t
even Stop and fertilize a tree with-
out becoming a spectacle, The main
focus of my job would be to remove
all unnecessary humans from the
campus. In other words, everybody
has got to go.

Having accomplished this sacred
and holy achievement, 1 will enlist
the aid of the state game commis-
sion in repopulating the Grinnell
Community with wild turkey. If you
wish to help in this great moralcru-
sade, you should write to one or more
of the present Trustees expressing
your support of my candidacy. In
order to Convince them of your sin-
cerity, you should indicate that you
would be willing ro walk over your
own genitals to get me elected.

Thank you for your continuing en-
couragement and support.

serious photographers on campus,
and hire him or her for consider-
ably less, with equal, if not better
results.

To me, the hiring of aprofessional
distrust or extremeignorance on the

Dart of the administration toward
student creativity and responsibil-

ity, particularly in the .iield of
photography. I say this despite the
recent inclusion of a Student photo-
graphic essay in the Grinnell Maga-
zine.

May r reiterate that this is, in my
opinion, as a photographer, a very
great waste of funds. More than
sufficient quality has been exhibited
by student photographers to warrant
the utilization of the resources on
campus rather than seek unneeded
outside assistance.

To the Editors:

There has never been much doubt
in my mind about the independence
of the Grinnell student body, or the

people who refuse to be herded

However, I feel things have gone
too far when rather than being

Perhaps I shall turn mine back-

Fine Arts Center Displays
Original Student Art Works

by Lynn Voedisch

Student art is now being exhibited
in the Fine Arts Center. The show,
which will run until May 19, feae
tures some 175 individual works by
most students currently enrolled in
art department courses,

A great variety of media are re-
presented; drawings, Sculptures,
wall hangings, silk screen prints,
jewlery, ceramics and paintings line
the walls and hang from staircases
on both levels of the Fine Arts Cens
ter.

A special sculpture and pottery
display has changed the look of the
Roberts Theater foyer. Student sculr
ptures and ceramics are placed on
wooden blocks and on the ground
within a sandvfilled Circular area,
giving the display an oriental rock-
garden effect. Cases containing
some ceramics and silver jewelry
are placed against walls. A hanging
chair is suspended from the west
staircase.

Hopefully, security will not be a
problem with the Show. Mr. Richard
Cervene, oftheurtdepartment.teels

that there was “overreaction to the
vandalism or the recentGrafton Boe-
hner exhibit" and sees no reason
why the art department cannot go on

“Student art is displayed with the
student’s written consent.” stres»
Sed Mr. Cervene. The existence Ofan
insurance policy covering all works
and the formation of a student se-
curity patrol for the art show will
make exhibition reasonably safe for
student artists.

An attempt is made to include as
many art students as possible inthe
annual exhibition. Representative
works are selected by professors
and the students themselves.

The show may be seen daily from
7 a.m until midnight,

Comprehensive news can be
heard daily on KDlC-FM, 55.5
it 3:30 and 11:00 a.m., and at
i, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11:00 p,m.

Common Cause

To the Editors:

There have been many issues and
affiliated groups or organizations
seeking the attention and financial
support of the college and its stu-
dent body. But one issue, currently
exemplified by the Watergate mis-
hap and presidential power, and
underlying most other past or pre-
sent issues, is the legitimacy of
government, its accountability and
accessibility.

With a responsible and respon-
sive government, the demands of
those receiving injustice, either th»
rough the domestic or international
policies of our government would
receive attention and remedy rat-
her than the usual mechanical res-
ponse of an immoral bureaucracy
parading under the banner ofdem»
ocracy.

The branch most easily accessible
and accountable, yet the most disr
traught, is Congress. While leg-
islative reform has been demand-
ed for several decades nothing has
materialized. COMMON CAUSE is
an organization lobbying for such
reform and other progressive leg-
islation. \

its constituency is basically ”the
citizen". its purpose is to counter—
act the powerful special interest
lobbies and remind congressmen of
their public duty. COMMON CAUSE
has been successful and has not
wandered far from its initial pur»
pose. The consequences of a muted
and passive majority have already
made their presence known. COM—
MON CAUSE has already begun to
right a wrong and insure its sur-
vival, why not take up the cause
too?

Burbules: Race
Clarification

To the Editors:

I feel l should take a few sentences
and a little more space in your edi—
torial section to apologize ior using
Gay Liberation as my example of
“radical chic" After speaking with
Paul Lenart, I realize it was tactr
less and insensitive and was a poor
Choice.

Certainly it would be ridiculous
for me to encourage black integ—
rity on one hand and yet to ridicule
an equally legitimate move for digr
nity and identity--that ofgaypeople,
black or white.

For the record, and to salve any
unnecessarily opened sores, I do
affirm the right of any individual to
participate in homosexual, heteror
sexual, bisexual, or asexual activie
ties. if I gave the impression that I
felt any other way, the error was
mine.
