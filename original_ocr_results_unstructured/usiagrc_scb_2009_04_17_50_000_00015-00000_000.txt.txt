Darby returns to prominence with intramural Bball

Iw DE VIN Ross

With the winter sports season over, the focus in Darby
has shifted to one of the most popular intramural events on
campus—basketball. With a total of 22 teams. 12 in the none
competitive and ten in the competitive league,various students
from all parts of campusjourney to the Athletic Center.

Ahmed ldrissa '09, a participant in the competitive league,
does not believe that being a part of the recreational league
changes the experience

“Guys and girls love to come out here and have a great
time—they aren’t extremely serious about it, but at the same
time like to be competitive,"1dtlssa said. “It's all about good
tImes."

David Arseneault ‘09, who has been a participant ofintra-
mural basketball for the past {our years and the Student Diree~
tor for three, agreed that it's a great experience for all players.

“It is a constructive atmosphere," Arseneault said. "Espe-
cially because they let us use the main gym in Darby, which is
exciting.”

Within the competitive league, the tension in many games
can be cut with a sharp knife.

"We've had a few close non—competitive games, but in the
competitive league
we've had some
teams win on buzzer
heaters and overtime
games," said Bobby
Long '09, referee
and participant. “It’s

Besides the actual players getting intense, the referees do
not shy away from becoming part of the action. John Bruns,
'10, a referee for the competitive league, confessed that he is a
strict referee,

“I’m justtrying to control chaos out here, make sure no one
gets hurt," ans said. “But, you know, sometimes they just get
really angry, they just don't like my calls."

Though the competitive league may get more intense in
some aspects, the recreational league has had their fair share of
unique experiences and intense moments,

Adam Langc ’11, a participant in intramural basketball
since last year, is particularly fond of the team bonding that
basketball is able to provide,

“The other teams are really tight outside ofbasketball since
they are on sports teams together," said Lange, who allows
prospIes to play on his team. “1 think we're deep since we don’t
really have more than one activity we do together besides base
kerball. We aren't as athletic and don’t have a lot of teamwork
built up per se, so we just screw around a lot."

It is no doubt that even in the nonrcompetitive league there
is no love lost between teams. However, sometimes winning
takes a backseat to pure fun.

“The one win we have between our two years was agaInst
the giris'soccer team," Lange said. ”They are much better ath-
Isles and much better shooters, but we are about two feet taller

rebounds.

Though many teams compete with passion, they do not shy
away from being a little bit silly with their tactics.

“It's particularly run to see the swim team come in in just
their speedos," Arseneauit said,

The szm team isn't the only one that takes on a silly peI—
sona during the games.

“A team that is pretty crazy is the ultimate team," Lange

said, They usually pick a gimmick every game, like sometimes
they'll only let one person on the team shoot for an entire game,
things like that.
No matter the league, It is clear that intramural basketball Is
widely enjoyed throughout campus
“I really wish there was male basketball." said Matt Zmudr

we do this, it's a really great time."
