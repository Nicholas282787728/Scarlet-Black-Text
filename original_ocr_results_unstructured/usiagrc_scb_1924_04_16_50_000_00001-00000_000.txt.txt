Famous Social Worker Addresses
Seniors at Graduation Day
Exercises, June 10,

HUNDRED 'AND FIFTEEN
SENIORS T0 GRADUATE

June 7-10 Set For Glass Day,
Baccalaureate, Alumni Day
And Commencement.

Commencement promises to ho un-
usually interesting and worth-while
this year, particularly in view of the
fact that Jane Addams. Worldrtamcus
writer and social service wcr . , has
been secured to deliver the Comnbenr
cement nddress. Miss Addams, who
has perhaps rendered as much genuine
service to humanity as any one wom-
an living today, has a long list of un-
usual achievements to her credit,

in 1589 she founded Hull House,
now famous social settlement in Chi-
cago, and has lived and worked there
as ”Head Resident” ever since that
time. She was formerly chairman
of the Women’s Peace Party, and is
now chairman of the International
Committee of Women for Permanent
Peace. In 1919 she was president of

the International Congress of WOW

men, and was a delegate to the peace
conventions at The Hague, at Zurich
in 1919, and at Vienna in 1921,

The class of 1924 is extremely fore
tunate in being able to secure a
speaker of such international fame
and popularity.

Commencement this year will mks
place dune i, s, 9 and 10, the Com:
meucement address being delivered
Tuesday, June 10. The committee for
the class day exercises to be held Sate

of president and Mrs, Main are re~
plots with tradition

With five records smashed, and sev—

the home meet last Saturday was a
decided success. The iuuiors repeat—

years, and again copped the meet with
a wide margin, having 78% points to

Sophomores, and 14 for the seniors.
Taylor was high point man with 11%
points, while L, Jones WES a close sec»
and with 11%. ‘

The first record fell when Taylor
clipped 375 of a second off the old low
hurdle mark, negotiating the distant-c
in 26 flat, As it was predicted, the
old shot put record of 35 feet. lo in-
ches, was completely smashed. Four

men broke the record, and four men _

heaved it over forty feet. The longest
throw. 42 feet, was made by soettger,
a ircshlnnn weight man. The halt
mile was broken by more than one
man when Porter and Moth-nth flu-

Scharnwcber in the iavelin throw and
set a new record of 153 test, 11 inches.
Finally, the junior halt-mile relay
team composed of Kitchen, L. Jones,
Green, and Taylor broke the record in
that event, which was formerly held
by the class of 1911: the new time is
1:33-1.

The surprise ot the day occurred in
the mile run. After trailing for the
first lap and a half, Brietenbaoh, a
dark horse, stepped out and easily

Cottage 11 Musical Comedy Opens
New Possibilities for
College Talent.

| ,FRUM THE clinic's GHAIR A

____’__————-

We wish to go on record as saying
that we round the best bit of enter—
tainment provided during the college
year in “Hearts and Spades." This
musical comedy, which had its gen—
esis in, Martha Cleveland cottage was
most ingenious and full of inlectious
good humor. That its authors clitim<
ed little for it made the adventure
more exciting. From the first till
last “Hearts and Spades" furnished us
with surprises.

We might digress at this time and
make an articulate noise in the world,
for we feel that criticism can well be
constructive and yet live up to its
high offices, There is much room in
a. College of this type for productions
like “Hearts and Spades." Such a
show enlists the servicm of a great
many people and becomes an enter.
prise requiring not only energy but
ideas. The passing show of college
life should more often be delineated
by the students themselves,

Individual performances rim of
such excellence that your reviewer
cannot announce an outstanding star.

“MIKE” HYLANR WILL

FUUTRMESUSBESS

Former Star at Iowa University
Accepts Position Here as
Head Football Coach.

CHARLIE BL‘AGK, K. U.
STAR, WILL ASSIST HIM

Kyland Has Had Several Years
of Miraculous Success
In Coaching,

fitter innumerable rumors as to the
athletic situation, information is at
last given out as authentic to the ef-
feet that “Mike” Hyland, who Will be
remembered as the man who put the
Grinnell football team on the upward
trend last fall, has been elected as
football Conch. Charlie Black. nth—
leLlc still‘ of Kansas university, has
also accepted a position at Grlunell as
basketball coach and assistant in foot-
ball.

With the election of two such Dromi~
ment athletes to head the coaching
situation in Grinnell,‘ it seems not too
much to expect that Pioneer athletics
will take a distinct turn for the better.

Why Point the Liiyi

' "Jobby" Jeanson, writing of Hyland
in the Des Mcincs Register, says, "or
all the athletes who have Competed
for the Old Gold of lowa, there has
probably never been one more color-
ful thall‘ Mike liyland. Why try paint<
ing the lily?"

Hyiand made an enviable reputation
for himself at lowa as an surround
athlete, and added to it considerably
by his successnil coaching experience.
For three years he coached football
at Leanderrclnrh‘l against unbelievable
odds, and achieved equally unbeliev—
able success. The first year of his
stay there, twelve men reported for
football, and "Mike" was forced to ﬁn<
ish a game against Cue—a Winning
gameiwith ten m‘ell, because he had
used up his one Substitute earlier in
the Contest.

"it year before Hyland went to
coach at Highland Park college. the
Highlanders had not goo one game
the year before, holding their easiest
competitor flown to a score of 33 to
it. During "Mike's" first year there.
the Highlanders lost but one contest,
and that to (Joe by a one touchdown
margin.

in his senior year at iowa, Hyland
was elected to the captaincy in foot—
ball and justified the selection by
proving to be a m‘ost inspiring leader,
for, as Jeanson says of him, “he seems
to have the happy faculty of impart-
ing the winning spirit to the team."
“‘Mike' played a slashing some," says
Jeanson, “for he was of the high—spir—
ited type of player who gets keyed up
to such a high pitch that he really
plays above the standard of his physi—
cal equipment." During his career

at Iowa, he built up a. reputation not -

only as a line plunger, but also as an
end runner, often getting loose for
long jaunts down the field.

The choice of Black all-Valley base
ketball guard for the past two years
as a Pioneer mentor also meets with
popular approval. He has been an
outstanding athlete at Kansas Univer-
sity, knows both football and basket-
ball, and is clean cut‘in character.
The general opinion is that he will
make Mike Hylanrl an able assistant,

Black was captain; of both the Kan-
sas foihall and basketball teams this
year. playing at half-back on the for
user and holding down a guard position
on the latter. His work on the haze
ketball lloor is well known to those
who saw him play here the last two
years. ‘
