DORMITORY OPEN HOUSE.

We have just been discussing the important question
of faculty-student relations, and might have mentioned
a current case in point uulnelyithe much debuted Clause
in the Constitution of the Student -Council which con-
cerzls social life in the dormitories under the proposed
House Mother plnu.‘

Apparently some misunderstanding has developed us
to the purpose of placing House Mothers in the donni-
turies. \Vlien the project was presented to the men, it
included as one of its major purposes the solution of the
dormitory social problem, part of which was the fact
that because 0! lack of proper chaperouage the club-
rooms could not be sufficiently used to entertain women
guests at bridge parties and informal dances. The men
were given to understand that with House Mothers pres-
eht certain evenings would be designated as “open house,”
and couples would be allowed to use the ululirooms. With
this understanding the men approved the plan.

of course, the approval of the men was probably not
necessary, but. any plan which concerns the life of a
group will have it better chance to succeﬂi if' the full
confidence of that group is obtained. Confidence means
cooperation. Cooperation means success.

\\e are simply suggesting three things, First, that
this type of soon life should he introduced on the cam-
pus‘ second, that the House Mother plan will lie hurl-en
of possibilities for any _ cut success or improvement in
dormitory life uitlicut this “open house" feature; and
third, [hilt u sympathetic attempt on the part of the Cumv
mittec to see the actual needs of the campus will probe
dhly result in support of this feature of the House Mother
plan,

As a matter of fact neither group has

which should be stopped, because it is groundless

Gl'illnell might profitnlily employ such a device. At

distinct feeling that professors, despite their higher erud—

acquaintance with the undergraduate. We nre certain
that students want the real educntionnl and social value
to be gained from wnrin extrascldssroolll friendships with

formal nnd austere scheduled class recitation. No uclual
access to the student's mind is possible under such eii-e
cumstances, and surely the lending or a class becomes
a mere empty formality lo the instructor. The “real

of students with teacher.
