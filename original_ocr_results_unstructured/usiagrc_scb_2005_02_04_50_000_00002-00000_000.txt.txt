Community gathers to remember Thomas

Alexander

On jan. 30, Grinnell students and (“CT
ulty gathered in Herrick Chapel to re.
member the life ofThomas Alexandcr ‘05.
Alexander, who died in a car accident over
Thanksgiving break, was described glow.
ingly by family, friends, and teachers as an
earnest but fun-loving young man with a
keen sense of empathy. “Thomas had a
sense or play," said Victoria Brown, history,
describing Alexandei as an incredible asset
to her class.

John Abramowitz ‘05, in his eulogy,
spoke of his attempt to “do Thomas justice"
through his speech. “The English language
is simply defunct when it comes to remen‘r
bering the life of a man such as Thomas,"
he said, but promised to do “the best I can.’
That spirit was echoed throughout the af-
ternoon, as speakers described how Alexanr
det had affected their lives.

symphonic Band Director Mark Dorr
praised Alexander, who played the saxo»
phone, for his cheerfulness. “In the band we
have a tradition that once you’ve auditioned
into the band, you don’t have to re-audi-
lion,” he said. “But every semester, Thomas
would show up, I'd say to him, ‘Thomas,
you're an excellent player. Why are you
hereP'And Thomas would say, ‘1 just want»
ed to say in.”

Other speakers talked about Alexander's
desire to make a difference in the world.
Monessa Cummins, classics, was Alexan-

der's tutorial professor. “My ﬁist misgiv—
ings about Thomas,” she began, to laugh-
ter from Alexander’s friends, “was when I
read his career goal was to be President of
the United States. I assumed that he was
either exceedingly arrogant or insuffei‘ably
ﬂippanr—or both." As she grew to know
Alexander, she learned that he had a pass
sion to make the world a better place and
thought that being President would give
him a chance to do that.

Several tributes to Alexander were also
announced at the service. Grinnell Band
Director Mark Don, in his eulogy, talked
of Alexander’s love for John Philip Sousa’s
march Tic Gui/out accruin'l‘he Symphonic
Band will be performing The Gal/am Sn)-
tntb at its commencement weekend concert
in honor ofAlexandcr. Abramowitz, citing
Alexander's dream of improving the world
through politics, pledged to do his part to
help fulﬁll that dream.

The service included several music see
lections. College organist Linda Bryant
played fem, jay o/Mlm'I Deririag as a pre-
lude. Ben Kim ‘07 played an arrangement of
snap/r Gifzr on the piano, and the Counting
Crows song Mr. Jones teMe was featured as
special music.

NEWS BRIEFS

New Darby tops college construction

While Grinnell College srudents en-
joyed a winter vacation, construction crews
braved the snow, building several one and
Off’cﬂmpus construction projects. Most
prominent is the new Darby Gymnasium,
which opened on Jan. 21,

Several other projects, including the Joe
Rosenf‘ield ‘21 Campus Center, the Conard
Environmental Resealch Area (CERA)
Environmental Education Center, the new
Athletic Complex and a new book storage
tacilrty, are proceeding on schedule.

Construction of the Rosenfield Center
began last summer and is scheduled to be
completed in June 2006. Jonathan Brand,
viccrpresident of institutional and budget
planning, said that construction will con-
tinue through the winter, “If they hadn't
gotten the foundation poured, it was possl'
ble that they were going to have to stop all
winter,” Brand said. “But fortunately they
got enough done that... rhc snow hasn't
been a problem."

The structure wrapped in plastic on the
northwest part of the construction site is
whore a specialty dining pavilion will be
located, while the steel frame to the south
will house SGA ofﬁces and Student Affairs,
as well as the post ofﬁce and the Grill.

CERA’s Environmental Education Cm,
ter, which will house two classrooms as well
as a greenhouse, should be completed later
this month, according to Brand. Neumann

Brothers construction is building both the
Rosenﬁeld Centel and the Environmental
Education Center.

Though the new Darby Gym is currents
1y open, the remainder of the new athletic
complex, which includes a ﬁtness center,
an auxiliary gymnasium and locker rooms,
should be completed in midsMay, “The real
push was to get the [gym] Open for the first
basketball game," Brand said, “and we met
that target. Now they're on a_ normal con-
struction schedule,"

Phase two of the Noyce Science Center
Restoration is currently in the last stage of
design. The Board of Trustees will review
the final construction documents when they
convene later this month.

The last construction project currently
on the college’s slate is the conversion of
space at the Facilities Management build
ing east oteampus into a high quality book
storage facility that will hold up to 150,000
volumes, alleviating some of the strain on
Hurling Library. Renovations include in.
stalling specialized climate controls and
high density stacks. “The storage facility
is expected to be ﬁnished by spring break,"
said Christopher McKee, Librarian of the
College, “We will move books over that
break and over the summer."
