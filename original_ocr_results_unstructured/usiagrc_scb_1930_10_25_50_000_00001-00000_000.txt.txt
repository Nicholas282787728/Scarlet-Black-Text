Dibble Loses Speedball Game

Pioneer Club
Organized to

Defeat Comes
After Winning
37 Encounters

Lester Scott Captains Gates
to 5-3 Victory Over

Champions

By TED GLEYSTEEN

(Sports Editor, Scarlet and Black)

That Dibble is not invincible in
speedball was the conclusion of Gates
hall Wednesday afternoon after
it defeated the Building six team,
,5 to 3, in one of the closest and best
played games in the history of Grin-
nell speedhall.

Playing before a large crowd, a
desperate under-dog refused to sub-
unit to years of precedence, and Dibr
ble. seven times champion, though
game to the end, was forced at last
to acknowledge defeat. .

37 Straight Victories

This game broke the record that
Dibble had dangled before all its ope
ponents: 37 consecutive victories and
not a defeat since the game was in—
troduced here seven years ago.

Neither team made any headway
in the opening minutes. It was like
a boxing match, each man feeling
the other out. It was not a game of
individuals, but one organized team
against, another. Before the close of
the period both teams were 'advanc—
ing into scoring range, but found it
impossible to score.

Farrorc Opens Scoring

Suddenly a toot of the whistle. A
foul against Gates and Farrara open-
ed the scoring for Dibble, when he
made good the penalty kick, Dibble
1, Gates 0. Two minutes later Gates
evened the count with a foul kick.
The quarter ended, 1—1.

The second quarter saw the Gates
forward combination of Scott, Wolfe,
and Canright start functioning. Time
aﬁter time these three men would
work the ball down the ﬁeld, only
to be stopped when ready to score.
Louis Wolfe, displaying some real
head work, gave Gates the lead when,
taking a pass from his team mate
Scott, dropkicked perfectly to change
the score to Gates 2, Dibble 1.

Kukolicll Prevents Score

Seeing their advantage overcome,
the Dibble forwards in the form of
DeLong, Farrara, Duncan, and Wol-
ﬁnger swept down the ﬁeld with
passes and long kicks, but failed to
register any of their attempts,

The third quarter was Dibble’s
round. Taking the Gates outﬁt by
surprise, Dibble scored on a pass
over the goal line, Duncan to Fan
rara, in the ﬁrst minute of play,
Again Dibble went into the lead, this
time, 3-2, An inspired Building Six
team then pressed the attack, and it

Campaign Will Continue

The completion of a great work has
just occurred on the Grinncll campus.
an event so usual in the eyes of st ‘-
dents that they fail to realize its
staggering immensity.

The college horse in company with
the college lawnmower and a college
workman has just completed the
mowing of thc college grass. This
,thing has been going on for six years,
.with the same lawnmower, about
‘20 times a year over a campus of 22
‘ncres,

Grass on Hands?

_ In order to comprchcnd the gigan—
tic task this lawn mowing presents,
just imagine the situation if all that

,and had to he cut off by barber-s.
,Dur-ing such a hair cutting process
the average barber would have tallc
cd enough to have filled a library of
518,392,800 volumes of modern novel
sizc. Just imagine that many cop—
ies of “Cradle of the DeCp” Glugl

l grass had grown on the heads of men.

0n the other hand, if the afore
mentioned grass had chosen to grow
on the chins of those men instead of
their heads, the amount of time
necessary to shave it off would have
kept the collective breakfasts of the
wives of all these men waiting for
26,285 years, 87 days, 11 hours, ani
36 minutes. Think of me collective
wrath of those housewives! The
eggs would get cold, too!
New York, Frisco, Kellogg

The most serious aspect of all.
though, is the thought of what
would have happened if the hor, ,
lawnmower, and man had all gone in
a straight line in this mowing pro-
cess.

They have travclcd far enough to
go from New York to San Francisco
and back to the railroad crossing
just this side of Kellogg. whore they
would undoubtedly block the Roclr 15'
land trains until next spring, when
there will be more grass to cut and
they could again move on.

Pres. J. H, T. Main of Gl-innell
college will give the address at
the dedication of Game hall next
Saturday morning after the Home-
coming ohnpcl. Donald E Gates
of Cleveland, 0,, son of the lane
Pres, George Gates, will be pres-
ent for the dedication ceremonies.

Carleton Homecoming game this of-
ternoon, The Pioneers left Thursday
night and spent Friday at Fairbault,
Minn., going to Northfield just be-
fore thc contest today,

when they first tangled. In seven
contests the Pioneers have taken five
victories and Carleton two. Last year

the game by a 27 to 6 mar in.

for the game today with the exception

him out of active football for three
week. Thomas, whose sweeping end
runs were responsible for the Carle-
ton loss last year, has been limping
with a char-icy horsc but was in shape
