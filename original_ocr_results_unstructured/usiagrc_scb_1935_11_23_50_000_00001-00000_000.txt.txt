Council Votes

New Method
for Audit

St ent Auditor to Get

Half Board Credit
for Work

A revised proposal for auditing
and control of student accounts
was approved by the student Coun-
cil Thursday afternoon
been presented for approval to the
faculty committee on student pub-
lications and organizations.

The new proposal provides for
the revision and strengthening of
the system of auditing student
accounts adopted in 1931. The plan
provides for the establishment of
the office of student auditor as a
half board job, with three parties
—the college, the student Council
and the
each contributing one-third share
of the expenses of the office.

Can Recommend Suspension

In order to strengthen the pow-
er of the auditor, the proposal de-
clares that “any treasurer who
fails to present his books for audit
in a satisfactory condition when
requested by the student auditor
shall be recommended to the com
mittee on organizations and pub
cations. for ineligibility for any of»
fice whilc'n college and that his

Credits be withheld by the regismv

trar until audit is made and proper
handling of funds is shown: and, if
a senior, he shall be ineligibile for
graduation until these conditions
have been fulfilled.”

“The expense of the plan will
amount to about 40 dollars for
each party,” according to Kent
Duncan, president of the Student
Council, “This is approximately
five dollars less than the total each

organization was obligated to pay'

under the old plan,” he continued.
To Apportion Expenses

“The actual share that each oi»

ganization will he required to pay

will he apportioned on the basis of‘

the amount of time that the audi-

tor has to put on the organizations I

books."
Under the rules of the new plan

Cleveland Preps Find
Formals too Tight
as Dance Nears

The Cleveland house party may
turn into a nudist camp if the
prcps' last mad attempts to lose
iweight haven’t succeeded by party
time tonight.

It seems that a few days ago
when they decided it was time to
press their formals for their house
,party, the majority of them were

‘they couldn’t even get them on. It
is said that one girl had gained
35 pounds. ,
Solution Needed

Something had to be done and
so the fattest handed her dress on
to the next fattest and so on down
the line. The idea worked splendid
iy, but the poor fattest hasn't dea
cided yet whether she'll go as Sally
Rand or the Venus de Milo. The
question before the house is: are
the added pounds caused by the
usual three "squares" or a. contin-

day?

A little :escal'ch on betweeltv
meal eating sheds some light on
the subject. Excepting boxes from
home—of which there are between
’15 and 40 received every dayinot
to mention laundry cases, express
boxes and special delivery peck—
'ages as sources of nourishment,
ithere are approximately five es-

latcrfor-breakfast and between-
medl trade.
Wide variety of Foods

_ When asked what students or-
ldered the most frequently in his
‘plhce of business, one proprietor
suggested ash trays, anotheri
water, and a third said they or-
dered coffee and glued their eyes
on the rolls as they drank i .

l Aside from these frivolities, we
‘collected the following data—list-
,ed, as far as we could determine,
in order of consumption: coffee,
