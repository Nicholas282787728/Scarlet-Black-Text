Ci‘eightonian Names

(Sprout lo Tlic Scarlcl and Black)

OMAHA—Hank Thomas, Grinnell
quarterback, was named the out-
standing man in the Missouri Valley
conference, and was given the cap»
taincy of the aleralley football team
selected last week from the teams
participating in more than one cow
ference game by the sports staff of
The Creightoniim, official student
newspaper of Creighton university.

Captain Oscar Christoffersen, who
has been placed on nearly every all-
Valley team chosen this year, was
awarded the center position. An
adept snapper-hack and a defensive
tower, he has put his mere 160 pounds
to good use in leading the Pioneers
through a fairly successful season,

Frank Duncan, a senior playing his
first year of football, holds down the
right end post. Although he was
not outstanding as a defensive end,
Duncan's play on offense was of such
quality to merit his choice on the
mythical eleven, As the receiving end
of the Thomas-tueDuncan pass com-
hinstion, he scored enough touch-
downs to land a place among the
leading scorers of the conference.

Bilto. tackle, and McCreary and
Graflund, haltbacks, received honorr
able mention.
