election campaign of State Represen-

will be required at the door. The event
is being sponsored by the Janet Carl
Reelection Campaign, the Poweshiek
Democratic Central Committee and die
Grinnell College Democrats,

McGovern began his political career
in 1957, winning a seat in Congress. in
1961, he joined the Kennedy Ad-
ministration as a special assistant to
the president and director of Food For
Peace, After leaving the administration
in the wake of the Kennedy assassinate
tion in 1963, he won a seat as the United
States senator from South Dakota.
McGovern won the l972 Democratic
presidential nomination, but was
buried in the landslide victory of incums
bent Richard Nixon.

McGovern returned to the U.S.
Senate after his presidential loss and
served until 1930 when he was defeated
by James Abner, a Republican irom
Mitchellville, S.D,

Since 1980, McGovern and five other
liberal Democratic former senators
have been organiiing a nation wide
liberal coalition to oppose the New

 

fairs Flossie Mitchell were at the scene of
the accident and Tederman said, “They
did a remarkably good job” dealing with
the situation. He added, ”Other studens
really helped out a lot, too."

A few students cancelled out shortly
beiore the trip, so the van was not as iull as
it could have been. rederman emphasized,
“We were awfully lucky we didn't have a
dent .”

As a result oi this and past accidents,
there will be a change in the criteria a stur
dent must meet to drive a college vehicle.
During the past two years [our college
vehicles, one truck and three vans were in
accidents. Three of the four automobiles.
said Tederman, were “totalled,"

Tederman stressed that the administrar
iion wants to he sure it does not “overact”
and “jeopardize certain programs"
because it knows “we're pretty isolated
here.H But the new rules are designed to
make college trips Safer, particularly
when using the larger vehicles

Any student driver must now have his
license checked out and may not have had

any violations in the past three years,
Drivers must also attend a short training
program ior operating vans given by
drivers with the physical plant. Students
may apply to Jim Work’s office to arrange
for training Work is the director of sum-
mer programs.

Tederman said it is a misconception that
students must be at least 21 to drive a col
lege vehicle. The minimum age for driving
the cars, vans and trucks is lb He en-
courages individuals or groups who may
want to use the vehicles to plan ahead so
they can take me proper training, other-
wise they may have to hire a driver with a
chauffer's license from the physical plant.
The dean thinks the new rules should not
“drastically curtail the availability or
vehicles. "

In the past, Tederman said, there was
concern about drivers for the Student
Government Association shuttles, Those
studentrvan operators are required to have
chauffer's licenses. However, in extreme-
ly bad weauier a'driver from the physical
plant will replace the student driver.

LaVeta Small seeks rebirth of
minority activities this year

by Kim MacDonald

The job description the college gave
LaVeta Small when she applied for the
newly created position of Director oi
Minority Aiiairs was, in her words, “pretr
ty flexible.”

As a member of the staff of the Office of
Student Affairs, Small's main responr
sibilities include counseling and helping
organize black and other minority
studean. She explained, ”There were con-
cerns among the administration that black
students were not totally happy here . , .
not enjoying as iull a liie as they could ”

Last weekend’s minority affairs retreat
ended in disaster when the van taking the
students to the retreat crashed. some five
weeks of planning went into “pulling
together the retreat," according to Small,
since she likes “tight, well run. polished
activities."

The purpose oi last weekend's retreat
was to allow Small to get acquainted with
the students and for the students
themselves to get to know one another.
Small had planned many group awareness
activities as well as entertainment and she
hoped to create more oi a sense or coins
munity through the event,

Another function of the retreat was to
discuss and plan the future of minority stu-
dent organizations at Grinnell. Since none
oi these organizations, including Concern-
ed Black Students, elected new officials
last year, Small hoped to institute a
“rebirth” of some of these organizations
under new guidelines,

As she understands the situation, one of
the problems which CBS faced was the fact
that a small number of students shared
most of the work involved in the operation
oi the group. Students felt “burnt out" and
Small believes that many other students
would like to participate now, By helping
Students to develop leadership skills and
encouraging them in the reorganization
process Small would like more students to
become involved. “Mini-organizations” is
one of the solutions Small hopes will get
more students involved.

“I am a product of suburbia." explained
Small, who grew up in a predominately
white school system, then went on to a col-
lege where she met more black students,
but was still in a mainly white Student
body. Because of this experience, Small
feels qualified for her new position, “I am
comiortable in a mainly white atmosphere
and sensitive to the needs of black students
in such an aunosphere,” she noted.

“There’s got to be a cooperative effort of
reaching out” on both sides she explained.
Some black students come to Grinnell
trom predominately white high schools
and thus are used to an atmosphere such
as that found at Grinnell. However, some

students come to Grinnell irom innerrcity
schools or predominately nonrwhite
schools and Small feels they need people
“to be gentle and pull them in." "People at
Grinnell are not anti-social," and she sees
any problems as being more the effect “of
human nature than race . . people want to
feel Wanted "

One oi Smalls plans is to increase stur
dent s “comfortability index. ‘ She eXr
plained this pet catch phrase as simply
meaning “people ieeling good about peo»
ple.” She would like to work on increasing
Students tolerance for different life styles
and attitudes, and feels that steps in this
direction will bring about a greater
cohesiveness on campus.

While part of Small's job is to help
minority students become more integrated
into Grinnell as a whole, she feels “there is
a need for the minority students to have
their own organization." “I am not a
separatist," Small noted, and she at-
tributes some of the difficulties faced by
minority students at Grinnell to the fact
that “they are not really comfortable on
campus.” She cited a study which found
that on a campus this size, there must be
approximately ”75 to 30 minority students
for harmony to be maintained, so that
students can iino ‘personality niches.‘ "
Due to stepped up admissions recruiting
there are some so minority students at
Grinnell this semester,

Small herseli is involved with perspec»
tivc recruiting and admissions, and she
noted that there is a commitment from the
administration to get “toprnotch, high
caliber” minority studean to Grinnell. She
added that this year there are a number of
black students who were “courted by ivy
League Schools but chose Grinnell." Small

will meet all minority students and will be
involved in the social aspects of their stay
in Grinnell.

Aside from counseling current and
future minority students, Small is also in
volved in the planning oi Black Cultural
Month which will kick off the first week of

October and Black History Month coming
up in February. She admits she has a lot of
ideas herself, but she wants and needs sup
port irom students. “I in one to par
ticipate," she explained. but she wants to
work on “team building" and feels that
students are responding well so far.

Her office is also involved in “building a
network with other minority affairs offices
on larger campuses” and Small recently
joined a national organization which deals
with minority students. In addition, She
would like to sponsor what she calls
“brown bag Seminars,” informal lunch
meetings combined With minirworkshops
on different topics such as time manage
ment and study skills, resume writing and
career interviewing skills

Small herself has some eight years in
counseling and administrative experience,
With a PhD. in Educational Psychology,
she hopes to do some occasional teaching
in the education department and has also
taught black history. She is familiar with
lowa but spent most oi the past eight years
at Southern Illinois University in Carbon
dale and at the Illinois Office of Education
where She worked as an educational
specialist and trainer on multicultural af-
fairs.

Despite cancellation of last weekend’s
retreat which was a personal disappoint-
ment to Small, she appears optimistic
about the upcoming year. “This is an oi-
fice that cares." she noted.
