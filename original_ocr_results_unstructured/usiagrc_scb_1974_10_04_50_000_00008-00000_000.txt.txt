Grinnell rseLawrence 23. For
Head Coach Edd Bowers and The
Grinnell College iootball team
Saturday was the end of a rourteen
game losing streak, dating back to
1972. The win gave the team a new
round conﬁdence as they prepare
to meet Carleton tomorrow in

Northfleld, Minn. Both Grinnell ‘ V

and Carleton hold 1-2 records,

it was the 226 yards rushing by
Tom Goetz that led the way as the
Pioneers battled back from
de cits of 770 and 1778 against the
Vi ngs. The winning points came
late in the fourth quarter on a 37-
yard iield goal by Dave Wopat.
That score was set up by a deeyard
run by Goetz.

Goetz scored two touchdowns in
the game; a 12-yard run in the
third quarter and a isyard pass
reception for a TD in the fourth
quarter. Quarterback Paul Crane
also threw a 7ryard TD pass to Jim
Casey in the that quarter. Casey
caught six passes tor at yards in
the game Wopat's iield goal with
8:26 remaining in the game gave
Grinnell a 25-17 lead.

Lawrence came back on their
next drive to score, giving Grinnell
just a two point lead with minutes
remaining. Their extra point at-
tempt railed when a pass was
dropped. The Vikings mounted one
more threat in the waning
moments oi the game but that was
stopped as the defense caused live
incomplete passes and freshman
Bob Grant dropped the Lawrence
quarterback for a loss.

For the day Grinnell gained 179
net yards on the ground and m in
the air. The defense held Lawrence
tom yards rushing and 134 yards
passing.

Bowers said, “We felt the Club
was coming along rapidly even
though it dropped its first two
games to Coe and Lake Forest. The
defense is vastly improved and the
offense is doing a much better job
of moving the ball and scoring.“
