In bungalow or mansion, workshop or factory,
dormitory or auditorium, there is no excuse for
poor illumination. We have cheaper andbetter
lighting in the electric lamp than ever before; for
the dollar that bought 1,115 candlepower-hours of
light with the carbon—ﬁlament lamps of 1886,
now buys 16,200 candlepower-hours of light with
the MAZDA lamps. .

Not only more light, but correctly applied light, is
the order of the day. The electric lamp, with its
ﬁameless yet highly concentrated light source,
lends itself ideally to reﬂectors, shades, and screens.
It is controIIed light‘safe light. And illumina-
tion becomes an exact science.
