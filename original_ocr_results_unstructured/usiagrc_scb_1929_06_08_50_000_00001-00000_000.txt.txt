.Set Gives Galsworthy’s ‘Windows'
Finished Tone; Rain Scene
. Declared Convincing.

BY VIRGINIA RTNIKER.

In every phase, lighting, acting, and
direction, Galsworthy’s "Windows"
presented last night by the local chap-
ter of the National Collegiate Players
as the ilnnunl Commencement play
was Ll splendid production.

The play iteli, a comedly‘ for idealists
and others. was extremely subtle in
in its analysis, containing much word
play and many finely veiled lnsinll8~
tiolls. That the cast succeeded in
communicating the interpretations to
the audisncs, was evinced by the lat—
ter's evident allpreciution and enjoy-
ment.

mun Eilecis Good.

The set was an unusually effective
one, artistic and appropriate in every
detail. The view seen through the
Windows at the hack of the stage was
beautiful as Well as realistic. The
setting, as all other details of the pro~
duction, was arranged by members of
the Experimental theatre under the
direction of Ruth Evans assisted by
Luella. Hall and Dorothy Hershberger,
directors of the Workshop Howard
licllrath and Edwin Hewitt in charge
of construction and Russell Peterson
and Elizabeth Breld heads at the
painting crcw. _ ‘

The lighting and rain effects 'und

the direction of Arthur l.nisscr"'and "

Edmund Morrison did a great deal to
create atmosphere and give the play
a decidedly protessionul air.

Phillips Interprets Well

The cast under the direction of
Sara Sherman Pryor. hcad oi the
Drama department, did consistently
convincing work throughout the entire
play. Mr. Gray and Miss Alvord as
Mr. and Mrs. March, heads of an in—
terestlng English family, were grace-
ful and natural in their interpreta-
tions; Mr. Phillips and Miss Roses
craus, window washer and cook cf the
Marches, did excellent character
work: and Miss Napier and Miss Dilu-
toll as contrasting types of youth were
both attractive and well suited to
their parts. Mr. Hughes as the war-
disillusiancd poet also did a good
piece of acting.

Others who assisted in the produtk
tion of the play, worc James Clarke,
stage manager; Claire Wyatt, assist—
ant stage manager; Pearl Haincs and
Chrlutte Bryn, properties; Harriett
Potts, costumes; Henry Bray, busi—
ness manager: Howard Peck, tickets;
