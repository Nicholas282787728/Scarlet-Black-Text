STATE MEET
Next Wednesday the annual

state ﬁeld meet ot the larger

schools otlowa tvtll be held at

Des Moines. The schools tzllctrlg
part will be the State University,
Amos, Drake, Gtinnell, Cornell,
Normal,Des Molnes and Slim}
son. The re. ‘t of the moat is in
much doubt; it will depend on
the way the weaker colleges take
points from the leaders. Drake
and Iowa seem to have the best
chances, although Ameo or Grins
nell may push the leaders.

Iowa has sure potnts ttt both
hurdles, the broadand higlrjumps,
the sprints, the discus throw and
the shot put. This is a better
showing; titan arty other school
can make at present. Dralre has
a sure thing in the pole vault and
probably in the high hurdles and
quarter mile. Antes will will the
hammer throw and the two long
rlistanccsand will probably take
places in the sprints, quarter and
weights. Grinnell has nothing
certain coming but tropes to make
a good showing.

Rates will be given on all rails
roads. The team is going to Des
Maine: to do its best and a Ialge
crotvd tvill accompany the track
men.
