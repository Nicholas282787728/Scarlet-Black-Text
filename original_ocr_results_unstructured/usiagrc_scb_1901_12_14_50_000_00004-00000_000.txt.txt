STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD
OF CONTROL.

The recold of the ittotbdll xea
son of 1901 uill be one of the
brightest pages in Iona College
athletic annals. Starting the sea
son with a|i)tllln§jl but brilliant
prospects and acknowledged by
all to promise only a second—rate
quality or football. the team has.
by hard and conscientious work
fought its way to recognition as
the equal of any team in the state,
having lost the championship only
by a chain of circumstances over
which the team had no control

Several notable changes have
occurred in connection with tlte
season.

First may be mentioned the
passing of the graduate systent of
coaching. Many at us hope this
may be only temporary. but tor
several reasons it seemed best this
year. The team.the BoardotCon~
trol and everyone connected with
Grinnell bv interest in athletics
feel that'ive' were tortunate in sec
curing the services ot Mr, Paul
Tratt as the season’s coach. With
the aid of J. P, Watson’s training.
he has instilled such it degree of
tootbailtechmqueintoalighttcam
as to counteract the advantage of
more weight on almost every op-
posing team at the season.

Another change has shotvn it-
self in the spirit of the team. \Vttli
only two exceptions there has oc-

 

 

THE BACK t

curred no instance or departure
trom that spirit. the standard of
which has given Giinnell so much
prestigein college athletic. That
a team. alter such a series of this
fortunes as betell Gi‘iilnell during
the days previous to the
game. should go into a game with
the do-otdie spirit shown by our
men in that contest. is worth as
much to an alumnus as a Victory.
For such a spiiit, when governing
the athletes of a school to such a
degree as that exhibition indicat-
ed. will win many games otherwise
hopelessly lost.

Notablctoo this tall has been

the interest shown by students in
the work of the team. Next to
the tradition of ”Grlnnell Spirit."

Iowa

'jour athletics here need the tradis
‘tion oi “Student Backing." May
it prove a living reality!

The Board of Control also feels
gratiﬁed that the ﬁnancial
cess of the season will enable us to
reduce the debt somewhat. Mr.
Spaulding has used good judge-

sucr

and a proﬁt over all

ment in ins business arrangements
l W.
lspeaks eloquently in his praise.

i All in all. the season has been
one worthy of Grinnell and of

which every Alumnus is proud.
One prominent Alumnus in Min-

neapolis expressed his opinion
thus, “On the whole. Grinnell has
covered herseitwith more glory
that has Minnesota."

we have enough disastious sea-

In uriet that summarizes what is a'
question extremely vttal totvhe lite
of athletics in G'riniiell. Every
student complains it we do not
have the best or trainers, the best

to stippttii the effort to have the
beol. He goes in two or three
games and gets valiic received (or
every tent at admission he pays.
Yet he thinks he has done his
dilly tor the year, although in tact
he has only helped to meet the
expeih’es of the games he has
seen. In ieaiity he has not given
a cent to support the iraining‘ of
the team which lie is so ready
either to boast oi or criticize.

plexion. Every man and every

to the Athletic Union.
