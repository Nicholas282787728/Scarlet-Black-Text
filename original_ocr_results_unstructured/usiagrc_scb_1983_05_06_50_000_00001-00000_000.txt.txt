more input

by Eric Green
next year there may be a new look to

student interest groups and organizations
on campus. Jon Scharfi, SGA’s Presidentr
elect. and campus groups are planning to
organize a Student Union to promote cone
tact and cooperation among student
organizations.

Schari‘f said he thought of the idea last
year when conilict erupted between the ad
ministration and students over Issues such
as tenure. “There was limited com-
munication and awareness between cam-
pus organizations," stated Scharff. "The
students needed one voice "

Basically, the Union would consist of an
office and meeting rooms. probably in the
Forum, which would serve as a central
location for communications and publicity
for all groups New students and those in-
terested would then have each group's
literature and calendar available in one
place

Scharff also feels that SGA does not truly
represent interest groups and believes the
Union could bring together like-minded
groups. He believes that the Union en
vironment could unite groups and magnify
their effectiveness.

Scharit would also like the Union to be
partially integrated into SGA, with at least
one voting representative on Joint Board
He said, “SGA would probably have more
respect it it had the interest groups behind
“ ..

John Mofiet, current SGA President,
believes SGA is presently capable of
rellecting student opinion. He opposes the
idea of allowing Union representatives to
vote on JB: “Now everyone is given equal
representation. if interest groups had-a
vote some students would be represented
twice."

He stressed that this year .18 has made a
special effort to solicit student opinion and
to ensure student participation in ad-
ministration decisions.

Conﬂicts with SGA are a distant problem
[or the proposed Union. Presently, the
groups need to organize and address their
immediate problems.

There are three main problems lacing
campus groups. according to Matt Adams
oi the Grinnell College Gay Community.
These are:

A lack of communication between
.various groups,

A feeling that SGA is not representative
at groups' needs.

A lack of coordination in publicity ef-
forts.

Adams feels that the Union's organizers
this year did not request enough input
irom the groups, which resulted in a plan
that did not elicit an enthusiastic response
from the organization,

Adams believes that next year the
organizers can start from scratch and in-
itiate a charter that will accurately reflect
the groups' needs, Scharii stressed dial he
is flexible on the specifics of the Union,
The groups. he said, “have to come up with
their own charter." .

Members or the South Africa Support
Group, a more political organization, also
see advantages in the Union structure.
Joel Robbins favors the concept because
“it could spread interest across group
boundaries." Lisa Beth Kaplan said,
“There are obvious links, but the groups
presently are not coming together."

SASG members also thought something
was needed to bridge the gap between
loosely organized groups and the more [ore
mal SGA. They feel that a Union could imr
-prove interest group representation and
input on SGA and its legislation.

Curriculum_ proposal
released to faculty

A proposal recently released by Morris
Parslow, Curriculum Coordinator, is a
dralt of possible curriculum requirements
to be acted on formally after the fall
semester or the 1983-84 academic year.

The Scarlet and Black has obtained a

copy or this proposal and has summarized
the contents.

”The requirements represent skills and
knowledge that the laculty generally seem
to believe our students should seek to ac»
quire in the course of a liberal education,"
states the proposal.

The requirements, including the
Freshman Tutorial, could impose
anywhere from 24 to 40 credit hours on a
student, "credit hours that they might not
otherwise elect. For a majority of all
students the impositions would probably
amount to fewer than 20 credit hours,"

The proposal requirements are as
follows:

I. 4 credits of Freshman Tutorial.

If. A. 4 credits of designated problem
solving isloan Level I).

B 4 credits of designated
mathematical modeling or applied
mathematics tSloan Level II).

III. A, 8 credits of laboratory science or

Escort service

by Rob curley

While the advent of an escort service on
campus is not the product or a new and
revolutionary mode of thought, the current
eiiort is perhaps the most extensively
organized to date,

Kirsten Skaggs is the coordinator at the
70 student volunteers working to maintain
the social service, Thus far the response
has been favorable from both the
volunteer escorts and those for whom
they have been oriering their time.

On the part or the escorts there seems to
be a warm feeling generated by their come
mitmeni. “It is good to have helped
somebody who needs this type or service,"
commented Stephanie Ferst “it has made
me more aware of its value on campus "

Clearly the feeling is shared by those
who have used the service. Paula Nixon,
who uses the service on a regular basis
said, "The escorts have been consistently
prompt and friendly. . . it's nice to have the
comfort or company when walking at
night."

 

 

one science.

B. 18 credits of social science in one
science.

C. 8 credits of Humanities

D. 4 credits of fine arts in one depart-
ment.

E, 4 credits of Non-Western Studies.

in addition, the proposal contains

guidelines for majors recommending that
"as soon as possible, all departments
should specin or designate four credits of
100 level, eight credits of 200 level and
eight credits of 300 level." Courses at the
100 and 200 level could be subject to place-
ment and exemption where appropriate.

The proposal, characterized as “a draft,
a working paper," invites taculty
criticisms, amendments and evaluation,
even from those faculty members opposed
to requirements, The Committee wants to
“try to develop the most coherent and
generally acceptable proposal" it can
betore submitting it to any sort of binding
judgement.

The draft attempts to describe a struc~
ture die "students can conform to Within
the present curriculum, one that presupr
poses at the outset no new course, no
reallocation of faculty and no radical
redistribution of students."

seeks to grow

The escort service has been attempted
in Grinnell betore, but for the first time it
hasn‘t been directly prompted in response
to a malevolent occurrence around the
campus.

The creation of the escort service is a
product of the recent Women's Conference
at Knox College where most oi the schools
of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest
(ACM) were represented.

According to Sltaggs, there was a
general concensus among the various
groups that the use of escort services tend-
ed to fluctuate, rismg in the wake of sexual
assaults or harrassment, and declining as
the threat becamea memory, buried in the
past.

The plan ior this escort service is pat-
terned after a service currently in effect
on the Coe College campus. The hope is
that, like the Coe serVice, the'Grinnell Cole
lege students will eventually be able to
take part in the escort servlce as a work-

Constitution
goes to a vote

by Jane Kaufman

A May 16 ratification date for the SGA
constitution was unanimously approved at
this week's Joint Board meeting.

Student Rule Committee Chairman Eric
Pedicini explained, ”it goes to the
students. Hopefully, I'll get a copy of the
constitution in each dorm and in the
library. There will probably be 13 or ‘4
people voting " A so percent majority is
needed to ratify the constitution.

After a question and answer period con
cerning media expenditures, the SGA fall
semester budget was passed unamended,

Peter Fretheim, Loose Hall president,
asked, "Why is the Sim budget going up so
much?"

Rich Letchinger, Student Publications
and Radio chairman, responded, “Prinr
ting costs are variable. Unfortunately its
[having a printer in town} a very comforr
table position. We have to pay a little for
the luxury of having it so close."

in response to the question or whether
negotiations on the price had taken place,
Letchinger answered. "The percentage in-
crease is not outrageous , . In essence it
was not negotiated "

Media Business Manager Michaelene
Kelly added, “Most of the money allocated
by Joint Board goes to printing,"

When asked to justiiy KDIC's 9.1 percent
increase, Chris E‘rtel, station manager.
replied. “Our budget from SGA is a little
more than enough to cover day to day
operations but not enough to make capital
improvement."

Haines l-lall President Pete Hautzinger
commented, “it seems to me that capital
improvement should be by special
request."

Discussion ended and the budget passed

A $500 request by Concerts Chairman
Daniel Klatz, railed after many questions
were raised. Klatz was not present at the
meeting.

Read Hall President Laura MacDermith
stated that JB should not pass an alloca-
tion {or Klatz when he is absent. other
representatives expressed support tor her
position.

Treasurer Vern Juel explained, “This is
what I know, I understand he's [Klatzl
running over budget."

Kelly added, ”I'm slightly upset that
he‘s running over budget.” She cited a $200
increase previously granted to him. Clark
Hall President Bethe Keegan asserted, “i
think that he should be called to question.
The campus community is going to
suffer."

' Discussion ended and the allocation fail-
ed.

Mark Bradshaw, ex officio member of
the Committee on Student Life reported on
the past few weeks' discussion. “There‘s
been a lot oi controversy over the newly-
instated common damage policy. The old
system seems to be controversial. were
uncomfortable with the policy, but it's bet-
ter than the old one,"

Bradshaw announced that the Finance
Committee allocated money for the
Forum's purchase of a sound system,
"The bottom line is that SGA will have ac-
cess to the Forum sound system "
