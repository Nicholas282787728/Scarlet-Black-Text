$50 In Fines

The CofHP lcvicd $50 in dis
ciplinory iincs during the last
two weeks. Two Cowlcs sopho-
mores, a Langan senior and a
Langan freshman were the re-
cipients of the tines, which in-
volved violations oi the drink-
ing rule in each case,

At its Jan. 23 meeting the
council fined the two Cowles
sophomores $15 each tor disor-
derly conduct while under the-
influeiice ot alcohol. One oi the
two appealed his fine ‘on the
grounds that he did not partic-
ipate in tiie disorderly conduct.
After iurtiicr consideration oi
the case the council reduced
the line to $10.

The two Langan men were
fined Siﬂ each ior possession

”The car in Prague looked
like an overgrown forest," Mar-
Jon said.
‘ Prague is also an industrial
city, manufacturing heavy mas

- chinery, automobiles, aircraft,
rolling stock, chemicals, electri-
cal and radio equipment, tires,
paper, clothing, furniture and
foodstuffs. Marion noted the high
quality of two other Fraguc
products: smoked meats and
beer.

Pauley describes Prague as
“essentially a German city." it
was lounded by German colon.
ists in 1232, had many Ger—
man citizens, and was used ,as
the center of German admin-
istration during World War
It. Boiorc the war, Czechoslo-
vakia's 13,000,000 population
included 3,000,000 Germans,
but when the occupation end-
ed, the Czechs drove out all
but 200,000 of the German.
speaking people.

\, Land and Resources

Czechoslovakia, which is 413
miles long and ab'out7,000 square
miles small-«r than lowa, is inr
dustrialized, cspecially in the
west, and is rich in coal and
iron. its uranium mines give the
country c. rd value to Russia.‘
Various gi ins term 00% of the
agricultural output, with sugar
beets. hops, and malts also inie
portant. Ccech crystals and chinat
are among the besisknown man—1
ufactui-cs. ,

About 05% oi the industry
is nationalized and most of the
better iarnis are collectiviaed, i
Marion's uncle’s iarin is still 1
his own, but his best land was
taken and he must give a
large part oi his produce to
the government. Jane‘s uncle 1
lost his drug store, and her
grandmother the ownership oi
a large house in Prague. ,

“The stores display ugly, old-l
fashioned clothes and other a
ticles which are hopelessly Dulr
modcd. to the weslcrncr, such as
78 rpm phonograph records,"
Fauley wrote, “The clothes are
just horrible, the material very,
thin," Marion said, i

Marion’s iamily sends used
clothing and shoes to relatives i
in Czechoslovakia, and Jane’s i
iamily sends yarn to an aunt i
who makes sweaters and sells ‘
them. Marion explainedi "If
you spend money to eat. you
don't have clothes."

People Friendly, Careiul

“The people," wrote Pnuley,i
“in spite oi so many years oi
dismal living, are very friendlyl
to visitors. They were more will- i
ing to talk to a (oi-cipher than
1 had thought, but still they
were carctul not to ,be over-‘
heard, and would not talk about,
some particularly touchy sulml
jects.

“I learned that between 25
and 30 per cent or the people
of Czechoslovakia are behind
the government, which is the
largest percentage oi any Com-
muni country. It is the only
country not to be occupied by
1tussian troops, and along with ,

increased Salaries

President Howard R. Bowen
announced this week that the
college trustees, mecting on Jan.
24 and 25, approved a “Very
substantial” allDiment [or faculr
ty salary increases. The details
of the plan are to be worked
out in the spring and will be
submitted for ﬁnal approval at
the irustees' June meeting.

“While' the details are not
worktd out," Bowen stawd,
“this is expected to he a. very
signiﬁed!“ increase which will
put Grinneu salaries well
ahead of those in competing
institutions."

In other action, the trustees
formally approved beginning
the construction OI the library
this summer and approved the
building plans which now in—
clude a Wide balcony, covered
by an overhanging root, on the
south side of the building.

East Germany it out vs the
‘llighest’ standard oi ving.”
Marion also found the people
very friendly, but in conversa-
tions with the people “the pro.
Communists were‘ trying their
best to show how friendly they
were," Marion tell that the pro—
Coinmunists were trying to tell
the others “how Well-off they
are," asking her about various
objects, ”Do you have this in
your country?" She was cons
Vinced' that her silence in these
discussions would be “the most
ciiectivc answer."

Beiore the war, according to
Miss Davidson, the people were
not well—dressed, even in
Prague. But the poor people
danced in the streets Said
dliss Hunter, f‘TlIey didn‘t
have much, but they knew
how to have _a good time."

Now, said Marion, “The spirit
is gone.” There are no dances or
gymnastic contests in the vil—
lages; the people are too tired.
The nice restaurants are too exe
pensive ior any but the wealthy
and the tourists. There are mo-
tion pictures (mostly ltalian,
French, and German), but these
also are expensive, Marion said
that many people remarked to
her, “I wish you could take us
out with you in your suitcase."

For Advanced
Credi’r Sla’ius

The faculty has adopted it
policy on advanced place-
ment with credit hours for

entering students who have
taken advanced entrance
examsi

According to this policy,
adopted at a meeting last Mon-
day evening; a new student may
bccanic a candidate for ad-
vanced placement and appro-
priate credit upon presentation
of a grade of three or higher
on any one of the iollowing
twelve College Board Advanced
Placement examinations: English
composition, literature, Euro-
pean history American histor,
French, German, Latin, Spanish,
biology, chemistry, physics and
mathematics,

The College Entrance Ex-
amination hoard gives a grade
ranging irom one to live tor
each advanced placement
exam which a student takes.
Most students who take those
exams do so because they
have had college-level class
work in high Schouli

An advanced placement CK-
ainiiiation grade of three or
higher will normally be con—
sidered as comparable to col—
icge translcr credit and will

carry eight hours of credit.

upon presentation oi a grade
oi three or higher in three.
or more oi the exams. a new
student may receive a maxi.
mum of 24 hours oi credit
and thus may complete his
dcgree requirements in three
years with normal registra—
tion.

The advanced placement pro-
gram will be administered by
Dean of the College R, Home
Norton with the advice of the
departments concerned on the
basis of the grade level achieved
on the exam, the quality ofl
secondary school “college-level,
work" and an interview with
the candidate during New Stu-,
dcht days,.‘in the fail. ‘
