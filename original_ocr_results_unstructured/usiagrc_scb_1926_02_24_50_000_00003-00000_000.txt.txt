“OUTWARD BOUND”

English Play Selected by Dl'lllua L'llliiY
To lie Given March '26.

“Outward Bound," by Sut‘tou Vaul, a.
comedy-melodrama, is the play recent-
ly chosen by the Dramatic club {or
presentation March 2a. The play- has
been presented in New York and Lon—
don. but this is probahly the tirst time
it will be seen west oi the Mississippi.

The play is very unusual in that ev-
ery character is supposed to be dead.
The plot is wound around the imagin»
aiy journey or a ship carrying the
dead to visit heaven and hell. The
nine characters range from the high-
est positions in society tn the luwest,
from the English society woman to the
charwurnun.

None or the characters will admit
that he is a ghost, and the audience is
kept guessing as to the final outcome.
The play is' replete with thrills, and
the iirst act climax has received
praise by critics both in New York and
London. '

The cast will be chosen from thc
club members by the last or the week.

and worlr will be begun immediately.
Ii the play is a success at the spring
presentation, the cast may attempt a
road trip.

According to Nelson w. Wehren
