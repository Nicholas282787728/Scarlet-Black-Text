sociation. Only one person polled,
knew what it was about. Thel
lavorite answer' was “Well, I
think I've heard something about‘

000 students in 305 colleges and-

can repeat thc'title of the rec-
ord is qualified to try the “jack-
pot" question. Previous winners
were asked to name the presi-
dent on the ,lwenty—dcllar bill,
