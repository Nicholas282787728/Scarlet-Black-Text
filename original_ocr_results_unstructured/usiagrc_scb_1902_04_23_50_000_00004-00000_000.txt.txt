BASEBALL AND TRACK.

Mass Meeting to he Held in the Chapel
Friday Ahernoon.—All Students
Urged to Attend.

Let everyone who reads this
pass the word along that the Iowa
baseball game will he played Satr
urday torenoun instead or Friday
as the last issue of SCARLET AND
BLACK erroneously stated. By
way of prepdiation ior this game
and [or the ﬁeld tnects that our
track team will have, there will be
a mass meeting in the collcgc
chapel Friday uttcinoon at 4:l5
and an effortwtil hemadeto arouse
among the students an‘entltm . it
over Saturday's garlic and meet
that is worthy of Iowa College.

Saturday we will have a chance
to do something that we have not
done [or a shamefully long time,
to give otir ball tcam respectable
support at a game which it will try
hard to win. We have every rea-
son to want to win and we also
have every reason to believe in the
strength otour team. We cannot
afford to told our hands and stay
away when the fair name of Grin-
nellisatstalse. Atremendousrc-
vival in baseball interest through-
out the state is in evidence this
year, and Iowa College must
swing into line as gracefully as she
can or be listed among the dead
ones. Even if it should cost us an
extra effort we shall see our
money’s worth ofguod,clean base-
hall next Saturday. Whoever
stays away without sufﬁcient rea-
son will uot do his duty bythe col-
lege or by the hall team.

There are on sale now tickets
admitting the bearer to the whole
series or games to he played on
thehomegroundsthisyear. Four
games ior one dollar. These are
the Iowa, Knox, Drake and Core
nell, on Aprilz 6, May 2, May 14
and June 7 respectively, and in
each one of them the team will

 

need and deserve the support of
every student. Single tickets to
the ﬁrst three games will cost 35
centseach and to the Cornell game
50 cents.

UNCLE SAM’S cLuls BENEFIT.

ing ot the new club liouse,amove-
mom with which all are mold or
less familiar, but toward the ac
complishmetlt or which. all

havc steadily grown, until instead
of the 5300 building originally
contemplated, a club house cost-
ing ovcr 53.000, and ﬁtted out with
