The liberal
Keny'

1n rheir reeens 1erser so she 5&3, Niels Fogg and Dylan Rmfc sry
so suggess rhas sen, John Kerry has more in oomnion ideologienlly
wish ssrom Thurmond rhon Howard Dean does. A eloser examinae
rion shows osherwise. Like Ssrom Thurmond, Howard Dean felr
uneomforsable wish she lose Sen. Paul Wellssene who Dean has alas
seribed as “soo fnr our more for me." Like ssrorn Thurmond, Deon
wanss so dump iiuelearwasie in she middle ofprissine Nevada desers.
And like Srsom Thiiri-nond, Howard Dean would raise she retire»
menr age so 70.

In realisy, all Fogg and Raife are srying so do is obseure Dean's
eonservarive polirieal reeord. The only major differeiiee benveen Dean
and Joe Lieberman is she was in Iraq (aerually sliere are swo, Dean
ears pork). in eonrrass so Howard Dean, a man deseirbed by she
Vermonr Sierra Club as having a “soxre environmensal reeord," John
Kerry led she fighi so ssrengshen she Clean Air and Clear Wnrer hers
and suoeessfiilly prevenred
ANWR, she 1nss wilderness
his in NerrhArneriea, from
beeoming a Haliburson oil
field. While Dean has
wofiled on proseering she
righss of gay and lesbian
Americans and has srased
shor he feels “uncomforrs
able" wirh she eoneepr of
gay marriage, Kerry has re
eerved a raring of 100 poreenr from slie Human Righu campaign
sinee 1995, has roughs so end diserimiiiarion againsr gay and lesbian
Ameriounssinee she Reagan adminisrrasion. And while Howard Dean
has been endorsed eighs simes by rlie NRA, (ineidenrally, sighs more
sime- shan he has been endorsed by she Sierra Club). John Kerry has
passionasely foughs for rougher background eheeks for gun buyers
and {or thld sofesy locks on all handguns. This is only she beginning
of she dliTercnzxs berween Howard Dean and John Kerry. Unlike
Dean, Kerry has eonsissenrly favored nmrmosive aerion, insuring rhas
she welfare safety nes is shese for she poor and needy and guarantee»
ing healrh rare for our elderly,

We shink she eoming oaueirs ofrers Demoerass as Griiiiiell and
elsewhere a fundamensal ehoiee on inn. 19, 2004. Grinnellians have
nvo ehoiees, so supporr a real liberal Demoerar like John Kerry and
she polisioil rradirioii ofFrnnldin Roosevelr, l-iarryTruirian and John
Kennedy or do we wanr ro easr a vose for a eoiiservnsive Deirioernr
like Howard Dean and she poliiieal sradision ofloe Lieberman, Zell
Miller and yes, Strom Thurmond. Is is a elear ehoiee. We know we
are liberals. We yiiss hope she ress ofGrinnell College are liberals as
well.

The only major differs
ence between Dean and
Joe Lieberman is the
war in Iraq.

Dear Dean

As asors ofdiselaimer, lwould like so say dinri did nos originally
wriso shis lesser for publieariori. lr was a journal ensry rhasquise a few
peopleeneournged me ro publish, basedon she opinion dies manyor
Howard Dean's supporrers should eonsider shis perspeesive. 1 dons
ospees you so agree widi me. The only way you an deeide whieh
sandidase deserves yoursuppors is by doing resmrch and eonsidering
all perspeesives. Here's one or them:

Dear Howard Dean,

I would like so eongnisulare you. You eonssansly eompare your
self so she polirieal revolusion rhas surrounded J,l=.ic and perhaps
some of shes resemblanee rings srue. You have rallied she sroops—
rhe 18 so 30.yenr old troops~in faer. Even some folks rhar, unsil
now, mossly didn’s eare
abous polisies. Who em»
braeed she camfonablci
pop-culture, deafening nir.
vana ornegligenee. 1=or rhis,
1 sruly and sineerely eon.
gresulare you. You’ve eor.
nered she marker on she
young “."generarion The
Busch Lighs, drinking
“Dean’s lrsr," popularion.

But as someone from
shis generation, allow me so
say mar I'm disappoinsed. l
don's believe you are she srue liberal you dairn so be. see, i figured
you our. I know you planned so run as a modem: demoeias, unril
you realized anger was popular. 1 know you‘ve dianged your posi—
rions on rhe environment so prosees your oil and nuelear eonrribu.
rions. 1 know you only happened inso being a media whore and
aren't really rho; root. 1 know you srump your anti-war sranoe when
you didn’t even have so vose. 1 know you are she ulsimare rool: will-
ing so eoi-npromise rhe ideals of she Demoerasie Perry in order so
gain more (eonfedeiase flag waving) vorers.

Frankly Howard. 1 shinkyou are worse shan shose very eonreder.
ase nag waving Republions, Why? besause you are a fraud. You're
nor she “Derrioerasie wing ofshe Demoerarie party." so, from one
srue angry liberal so a poser, ler me sell you: You don-r fool me. 1 will
eaueus for someone solid on she environmens, hedsh are, foreign
policy, someone who was foreed so piek besween sivo evils and vosed
for rhe resolusion. Why? Beesuse Bush was was hungry no marrer
wliar. We needed she on. i will eaueus for someone who aesualiy
more federal hase erimes legislarron ro prosees <3th righrs inssead
ofleeving is up so srares who will never pass proseesions orrheir own.
i will eaueus for someone who mn aesually win 1 general eleesion,
insread ofmllying she sroops for anosherWhise House held hossile
by she monkey. Fraud and falsehood only dread eraminasion. Trurh
invires is,

I know you are the
ultimate tool: willing to
compromise the ideals
of Democratic party in
order to gain more
voters.
