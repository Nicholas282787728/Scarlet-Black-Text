would probably continue. An out-
door chapel would be the best
thing to start them off."

Robert smith, Larigan fresh-
man: “Dam right, I’d go to an
outdoor chapel. They need better
speaker-s than they have had,
though, llke Professor Lovell and
that guy they had here for Gates
lectures last fall‘, Dr. Crane "

Anne White, Haiiies junior. “1
seldom went to chapel because I
felt that I would rather be out
than in listening to the same
things I could get in classes.
However, I like chapel in some
of the more interesting cases."

Jane Lazai-rl, Cleveland sopho-
more: "If chapel is as unpopu-
lated as it seems to be, there is
no reason to continue it, Franke
ly, I think the main brigaboe is
missing a 15 minutes' opportune
ty for breakfast and inter-mission,
I would like an s: o, 9:20, etc.,
plan in preference to the present
system. Perhaps it does not
throw us off our old track so
much, or course we will get used
to it. But personally, I like the
idea of the free time, A chapel
for a special purpose can be enslr
ly regulated that way."

'Tol'al Effecl'
Will Decide

College Sing

“Total offset" is the basis up»
on \\l]l(:ll the second annual
11117430116512 Sing, tentatively
set for Mother’s day, May 11,
will be judged, according to
Miriam Johnson, who is in charge
of the arrangements.

A. preliminary contest will he
held at an earlier date, possibly
the afternoon of May 3, at which
all but ’thrce halls and three
cottages will be eliminated from
the competition. Tlrcso remaining
si- will then compete in the
final program for the trophies.
Permanent Possession.

To the winning hall will go the
John c. Fetzer trophy, and to
the cottage given first place will
be awarded the Dorothy S. Fetzer
trophy. Permanent possession will
go to the hall or cottage winning
the trophy for three consecutive
years.

"We want the allscollege sing
to become a Grinnell tradition,"
said Miss Johnson, “and one which
people from outside the college
will come and see. The element
of competition for the trophies
should make for a better pro—
gram," she remarked.

Small Crowd
Attends Annual
Spring Concert

A small crowd attended the an-
nual spring concert of the Grin-
nell Philharmonic orchestra in
Herrick chapel last night.

Robert Vagner directed the
orchestra which got off to a slow
start on the overture to “Der
Freischultz" (Weber). At. times
the brass section outweighed the
violins and gave a raucous effect
to the selection.

In Haydn’s “Symphony in C
Major " the orchestra began to
coordinate and presented the
gracious composi on with precise
ncss and vigor. The violins and
woodwinds were especially excel-
lent, and the total effect was
pleasing.

The final number on a rather
short program was a czardas, uLa
Gitana" (ourzon), a gypsy dance,
Although the interpretation seem»
ed a little heavy, there were
moments of beauty. Mrs. Gom-
bosi's violin solo was one of
these.

the carnival downtown on Friday
and Saturday nights, May 9 and

the city council Monday night,
and was vetoed on the basis that
small merchants in particular
would suffer financial loss from
the scheme.

”A substitute

“because we

intend to glVe the students their
money‘s north iii our last Varsi-

creased as will the other costs,

essary to make a go of this it we
hold it at the Sportsman's park,”

Kenct Pearce, president of the
Council or, House Presidents,
stated. “1 reel sure that we can
make a success of the carnival
there as well as anywhere else."
