or ion and n title race im-
possible to predict. I do t'eel
that it is iairly saie to say
that the winning club will
lose at least tivo games and
could very easily come out of l
the season with a big “three"
in the loss column. l
in the 1M board meeting pr
coding the opening or the sca—
soii, the possibility or using thc‘
16 inch ball in our league was
tossed mound and fol'tuliately.i
I believe, was voted down. This
idea was introduced because the,
.Knox 1M sotlball league uses
this type or ball, and our adopt
in; it would be a form of prep-
aration for the extramural suite
hall competition with Knox latr
or this spring.

However, everyone agreed
that the are pitching involved
in the lsrincll game would de»
tract ironi the game, and it
could very easily lose some of l
its appeal. In addition, the
possibility or IM bridge and
ping pong was mentioned. The
in chairmen were asked to
discuss this proposal with the
members oi their respective
halls, and the matter will he
discussed at length during a
subsequent board meeting.

who has any ideas or opinions
