Sthree straight games

‘ By Alex Severens

“The last diree victories have been
‘ good indicators of how well we’ve
1 been executing recently," commented
,. Coach Eskildsen after he watched the
women‘sbasketball team roll off three
- straight homecourt victories, all
, against tough opponents.
In a period of five days, the die-
' hard followers of the women
v hoopsters were treated to a 72-62
‘ victory over Cornell. a 78-68 Victory
over Knox, and a 6050 victory over
t Macalestcr. “Wehave to do the things
‘ necessary to beat each team, and the
fact thatwe beat three strong, poten-
ytially evenly matched teams, by ten
( points each, is an indicator that when
the game is on the line, we execute
' well." said Eskiidsen of the recent
I accomplishments.

Distributing the scoring responsi-
bilities between four or five players
was a preseason goal of the team, and
the victory over Cornell particularly
exemplified how Well this team has
lived up to thatgoal. Seniors Shannon
Hancock and Jen Wood continue to
be the fire for the team as they put in
17 and 18 points respectively. Amy
Fort was also her reliable, consistent
sclfas sheadded 17. Lisa York tumed
in one of her finest games of the
season. hitting 80% from the field
and 100% from the line for 10 points
and 13 rebounds.

ThePioneers clankedout78 points
on Saturday against Knox behind
some awesome shooting perfore
mances from Hancock and Wood,
this time with 25 and 24 points ree
spectivcly. The most recent Grinnell
casualty, Macalester, made the long

trip to Grinnell on Monday, and kept
Grinnell out of their game for a short
time. However, halfway through the
second half the women were able to
pull away. with a great performance
fromlen Kelly,who had 14points, 14
rebounds, and 6 assists.

Of the team's attitude and work
ethic. Eskildsen said, “The reason
this team is effective is because they
respect their opponents, We respect
opponents' weapons, and have thus
been able to take those weapons away.
There is a lot more to a winning team
than just scoring points. These play—
ers have followed up on their responr
sibilities,and they areexecuting well."

The successful homestand has a
good chance to continue, as four out
of the next five games are at Darby.
Tomorrow, Monmouth College
comes to town at 2:00.

season With '

By Cory Conover

The women’s indoor track season

with a meet mat ended four hours late.
Eighteen schools attended the Hill-
top Open at Cornell College. It was
"an ordeal," one mnner commented
under the condition of anomynity.

Coach Evelyn Freeman described
the Cornell meet as a barometer to
measure the track team’s progress

m— through Ute second week of practice.

“This was a lowAkey chance to ex-
periment in relay combinations and
to film techniques.”

One standout performer for
Grinnell was senior coecaptain Kale

'marathon”

Peterson who turned in excellent times
in the 4x200, the 4x400 and the 400
open. “Kate has been training basicly
year-round and it showed at the end
of her races. She was able to finish
strongly." Another impressive run-
ner was freshman Maurine Ness, who
“ran a quality quaner for this time in
the season." Ness ran a 67.4 in the
400.

The Pioneers will train right
through thisweekendwith their focus
on the south division championships
on February 15. Freeman concluded,
"We had to teach a lot during early
practices. Over the next two weeks
we will focus on conditioning, which
will help us in our next meet."
