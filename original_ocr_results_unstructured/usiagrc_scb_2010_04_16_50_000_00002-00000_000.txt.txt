Bone marrow drive comes to campus

Bv CASEY STRicKLER

While some Grinnell students relaxed during lastyear's Fall
Break, one student, Alenka Flga Y12, was about to save a 50-
year-old woman's life by donating peripheral blood stem cells
(PBSC .

Figa's involvement intially began when she enlisted in the
National Bone Marrow Registry at the Grinnell Bone Marrow
Drive last spring, Figa is in charge otthis year's drive along with
Bridget Zajac '12, Alison JamesonsLucy ’12, Melanie Echales
’12 and Gertrude Chong'lZ.

The drive will take place on April 20 from 9 am to 3 p.m.
in JRC 101, the same room registered in last year.

“I'm really glad I did it," Figa said. “It's a really good cause
and 1 just think even if you're siclc, everyone should have the
right to live more and right {or it,"

The group of students will be collecting money around
campus to help offset the slot) blood-typing fee Although
typing is free {or registered donors, the National Bone Marrow
Registry (NBMR), a nonprofit that registers and tracks willing
bone marrow donors, hclps roots the bill.

There are currently ovcr eight million donors on the registry
and there are more than 4,300 transplants yearly. PBSC and
bone marrow donations help prolong those with leukemia and
thousands ofother life’l‘l’ﬂeilfcnlng diseases.

Zajac also assisted in running the drive last year and is hop-

ng to get an additional 130 individuals added to the registry
hougli she admits that many Grinnellcans are already on it.

"It's always great when you’re tabling and you're like,‘Have
you joined the registry yet? and they're like. ‘Yeahl"' Zajac said.

At the drive,participants will smb their cheeks, to gather
the DNA necessary to determine their bone marrow type, Afr
ter they rill out the necessary paperwork—a 20 minute pros
cess—according to Zajac,

once matched, there are two types or procedures a donor
can use.Tlie most common procedure, in which doctors extract
liquid bone matrow-—instead of stem cellsifrom a donor's
pelvic bone. Patients sometimes need two to seven days to to
cover from the back pain intlicted during the donation, The
procedure itself, however, is painless

Figa chose to implement an alternative procedure, where
doctors give a shot of nigrastiin to raise blood cell levels before
putting the patient through aphaeresis, which separates bone
marrow from red blood cells. Afterwards, the red blood cells
return to the donor.

Matches are hard to rind, so donors aie often on the regis-
try for much longer than Figa.

“It was crazy becausc I registered last spring at the drive so
I wasn't expecting to be called [in the] fall of this year," Figa
said. “Being called that soon is not normal... [but] I’d do it
again"

on April 20, anyone aged 18 to 60 years can stop by JRC
101 between the hours of 9 ﬂJl’L rind 3 Fun to add their name
to the registry.
