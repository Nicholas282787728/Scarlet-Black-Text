Rebuttal to Borenstein

In his latest article, “A Question of
Pacific-ism," Nathaniel Em’cnstoin
builds an claboi- argument upon a
basic mi -onccption—that is, the com~

dcd American perspec-
h'ch vist all Soviet actions as
ve and expansionistic, while

completely ignoring the Sovmt
perspective of us. foreign policy.
Tl’HS leads him diicctly to the conclu-
sion that a show of strength is
necessary to stop the Soviets from
crossing certain vague lines, Registra-
tion for him is a completely symbolic
gesture to show the SoVicts that we
mean business.

Neither the [LS nor Russia im-
plements their policies in a political
vacuum. The Soviets realized their in-
vasion of Afghanistan would draw
criticism (although not as much as
has occurred! and so must have had
compelling reasons to go ahead

vent Islamic nationalism in Iran and
Afghanistan from spreading to Muslim

above inﬂation. 'rhcsc seemingly
unrelated moves contributed to
Russia’s insecurity, making their
foolish attempt to secure a politically
unstable border country all the more
likely. This is not a justification. It
simply shows that the Soviets’
“aggressive" acts are as much a rcacc
tion to U S, policy as our ”defensive"

But what are our "deepest values?”
Are they really peace and freedom?
Not even our moral PreSident Carter
thinks so any more, which is why he
told us that America would fight for
her “oil interests” in the Middle East,
not peace and freedom. This is typical
of our foreign policy which is not, as
Mr. Borenstein seems to believe,
altruistic and progressive. iran and
Nicaraugua are only two examples in
which we have established dictators in
order to support us economic and
political intcres

Given this new pc sp -tivc, what
will be the eflot‘l of reg [ration on the
Russian psyche? Rather than scaring
the Soviets into backing off, this ag-
gressive tas seen from their perspec-
tivel action will Call for a response in

Anderson as a viable third party candidate

Due to the current political scene
which favnrs Ronald Reagan as the
Republican nominee, this letter is
directed to all individuals who want to
see John B, Anderson continue his
campaign for the presidency.
Although this may eventually lead to
the formation of a third-party, I believe
that Anderson cannot be tnrgotten by
his supporters in favor of Ronald
Reagan or Jimmy Carter it he does
decide to run as an Independent. AS a
supporter of Anderson since he an
nounced his candidacy in August of
1979, l have seen his rise from one
percent in the polls to near victories in
the Eastern primaries. With his recent
poor showing in Wisconsin, however,
many people have abandoned Anderr
son. I feel this is a premature deci~
sion. Many Americans feel that a
Carter vs, Reagan election presents a
sad choice for American voters. Do we
Want our final decision to be a choice
between these two?

Now is the time for all Anderson
supporters to announce their support
if Anderson does decide to run as an
Independent. We need Anderson as an
alternative to Reagan and Carter. Two
arguments have been formulated
against a third-party. One states that
an independent will split the
Republican party. The other states
that an Independent will allow Reagan
to get many liberal Republican votes
from people who will not vote third-

party. Yet, the people who believe in
these arguments fail to perceive the
amount of support Anderson still
holds It is too early to write off the
possibility of an Independent victory,

in light of this, i urge all Anderson
supporters to write to his head»

remained significantly quiet about
U.S. efforts towards “increased

”true and universal peace" will not be
