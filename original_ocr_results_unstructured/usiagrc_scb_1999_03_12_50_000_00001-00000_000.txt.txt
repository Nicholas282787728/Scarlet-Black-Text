Concern about changes to

were dccp enough to pull more than
150 srudonrs ro Wedncsday night’s
Joint Board meeting of the Grinnell

ciﬁcally, students came to express their
dissatisfaction wldi the elimination of
one RLC position and rho job ofDi-
rector of Student Activities and New

will be vacant next year when Lisa
Maryo and Paul Valencic, currently the
RLC of Langan, Gates and Rawson

Flindors said. “it's really inconvenient and it’s boon like

Director of Computor Scrvicss Bill Francis has been
fighring an uphill barrio to return all systoms to pcak funcr

things may got worse before rhoy gcr borror.

Besides limiting unauthorized computer use, thc stor-

The server has oporational limits, however, and the

Panel to debate hog farming

Next Monday, a panel offour legs
islators and farmers will convene on
campus to discuss what has become
one of tho horrosr political issucs in
Iowa: largc.soalo hog production.

chrcsonrarivo Danny Carroll and
Senator Dcnnis Black, along with
Aaron Putze from the Iowa Farm Bu-
rcau andAaron Lehman from the Iowa
Farmer’s Union, will convene in the
Forum South Loungo to share widcly
different pcrspecrivcs.

Tl‘lC committee’s intentions, said
Mowcrs, were to create a session that

the current runding system docsn't
carry over year to ycar, Beavers said,

Beavers orplaincd rhar this lack of
regular funding makos it hard for stu»
dent groups to plan for thcenrirc year
For example, she said, groups may not
bc able to bookspcakcrs oarly enough
bccausc they don't have rho moncy or
they have ro work or scrambling to got

havc the money too laro, and if rho

Jacobson and boavors emphasized
that rho money for the new Commito

in Iowa. Idon't know ifstudenrs un»

According to Mowers, largo-scale
hog production srrikos a chord with
many lowans bccauso it not only af-
fects the environment, but also be-
cause it is also inrimarcly connected
with the state‘s fundamental economic
and social structure.

largo—scolc hog production differs
from rraditional hog farming because
with a largo.scalo operation—also
called a hog lor_morc hogs are con.
fined in one area. A typical hog lot will
support about 5000 hogs.

The high number ofhogs loads to
a massive amount of waste. Farmers
typically deal with rho wastc by stor-

volvcd because we wrotc tho proposal
and we happen to be sGA pooplo,"
said Jacobson.

Apart from SAF, which had
$40,000 this year, SGA has some stu-
dcnr programming funds, Firsr semcs»
tcr, SGA had 38,000 directed toward
student groups, and this semester, they
have $10,750 for studcnr groups.

“It’s finc [for groups] to pur in
highcnd requests,” said Beavers con.
rinusd. “I’lentyofbudgcts will be out,
but they can know ro look for a bud—

Jacobson added that the moncy is

noods, so groups know they don’t havc
to worry about rhc fundamentals. Still,
she recognized that rho standing bud-
gor commirroowill not solve the fund-

farmers out of work and has dramati-
cally affected the price of pork.

In the past few years, the Iowa lcg-
islature has considered a number of
bills attempting to address these issues.
Many of the bills proposed by envi-
ronmonralists rcquirod hog lors to
comply wirh specific regulations or
gave local counties rho authority to

7 regular: hog lots themselves.

However, largo-scalo raciliry own-
are and odicrs who objected to suCh
regulations proposed contrary bills giv—
ing authority to rho srarc or removing
certain regulations altogether,

In Mondays panel, both sidos will
be represented. Said Mowers, "It will

volved] In the process of making leg-
islation and dealing with this issue
[spcalt].. ..It’s an awesome panel.”

Although the panel was originally
set for last Monday, bad weather
prompted SCWI-II to reschedule rho
event for next Monday. Consequently, '
one ofrho original spcaltsrs, Environ-
mental Health Professor Kendall Thu
from the University of Iowa, will be
unable to attend.

Still, the views of the four remain-
Ing speakers should impart balanced

Mowers, "Hopefully it will be a stop—
