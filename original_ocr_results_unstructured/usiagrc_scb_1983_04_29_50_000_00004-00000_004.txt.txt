Adjourner Protest

To the Editor:

Last week in your article on the .lotnt
Board proceedings you quoted me as say

nalism in the Scarlet and Black. I merely
suggested that the meeting take a live
minute break. But nooo. That wasn't EXT
citing enough ior you. You had to quote me
as proposing to end the meeting. i guess I
can live with this, But that wasn’t enough
tor you. You had to run the headline

Did you realize what you were doing to
me? My proiessors and iriends that I meet
in the Pub came up to me and asked, “Did
you really propose to adjourn the
meeting?" My parents even called me up
irom New Jersey last night and asked me
about it. They couldn‘t believe it either

Editorials Questioned

To the Editor:

Who the hell writes all those editorials
anyway? They sound like second rate im-
itations of Howard K Smith or William
Satire as they scold Grinnell students for
acting like sophomoric boobies rather than
adults. I thought this paper was tor the
people, by the people and all that rat.
Geeze, you guys seem more interested in
sounding like a Journalism 101 textbook
than you do in writing on our level. Who
cares about social consciousness,
enlightenment of the masses or any other
such principle? I mean come on. w Signed,
A. Fool

Liberalism—one
last time

To the Editor. .

Last weekend we tried to iigure out
whether or not we are liberal We had
hoped to iind a deiinition oi ourselves so
that we and others might know what we
are. We tigured we could hang a sign
around our necks which would say
“liberal" or “not liberal," thereby saving
a lot or time and hassle [or our iriends and
acquaintances. Also. we would be clearing
up any misunderstanding between
ourselves and anyone who doesn’t agree
with our views.

It doesn't work. Don't try it. 7 Love,
Death Oberman. William Wilcoxeiu Mark

Than/es

To the Editor:

I just wanted to thank the entire Grinnell
College community [or helping to make
my stay there so wonderiul. I especially
wanted to thank the nice young girls irom
Gates who stopped by with the cookies and
magazines. Both were iar better than
anything we are able to produce in the
Soviet Union (the cookies and magazines,
of course), but we are trying to improve. I
don’t know it you wanted the magazines
back, but I decided to take them with me to
show my comrades back in Moscow. I just
hope my litﬂe Olga doesn't see them!

I apologize for the inconvenience I may
have caused and again express my
gratitude for the warmth you showed me
during my brief stay. — Sincerely, Georgi
Arhalov
