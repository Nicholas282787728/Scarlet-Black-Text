lInexperience Chief Trouble
in Tilt Last Week

(Special to The Scarlet and Block)

ST. LOUIS—More pressure was
brought to tho w ington nnivciu
sity Bears this wcck, as they pre-
pared for their second battle of the
,senson with Illinois college tonight at
lFrlmcis field.

The Bruins had a close call in their
opening tilt last week defeating Wil~
liain Jewell college, 6 to 0, through
a fourth quarter touchdown by Kyle
Cochranc. It was the same William
Jewell that held Washington to a
scoreless tie a year ago.

Not Pleased With Team

In spite of the fact that the wearers
cf the red ﬁnally pierced the eleven
that seemed impenetrable within the
shadow of its goal posts, Dr. Al
Sharpe and Gale Bullman, coaches,
were far- from pleased with the show-
ing of their men. .

“We haven't a bad squad." Gale
Bullman said yesterday. “It’s just
young. Too many boys that we are
forced to use as regulars haven't had
any experience."

Fredrichson Registers

The chief injury sustained Saturr
day night was by Vladimir Anastas-
off, little right guard, whose knee
was twisted. The playing of Glynn
Clark, a young, inexperienced tackle.
was the outstanding feature of the
game, from Bullman‘s viewpoint. He
shared line honors with Ika Van-
dover, veteran guard.

Ed Fredrickson, husky sophomore
backﬁeld prospect, was not used
against \Villiam Jewell because he
had not registered in school. Freda
rickson has new registered, however,
and will be eligible for the campaign.
He is the best punter on the squad,
and an allrl'ouud efﬁcient man.

Bob Higgins, fullback has reported
again after being out of action be-
cause of sickness. ”Blackie" Erspam-
er, a reserve center, has been switchr
ed to guard, with Anastasoff absent.

Chairmen May Change
Annual Class Tussle

The annual freshman-sophomore
class scrap may be changed again
this year, the council of house chair-
men making tentative plans to stage
a tug-of—wnr for the two groups.
The 1030 scrap was held on Ward
ﬁeld with members Of the freshman
and sophomore classes trying to get
sandbags across opposing goal lincs.
Pn‘al' to that battle, the traditional
scrap included a chase through the
night with a free-for-all in the morn-
ing.

If an agreement can be reached
with ofﬁcials of the Crinnell country
club, the proposed tug of war will
be held there, Frank Spangle‘r, Chairs
man of the committee in charge, said.

H. L. Donovan, president of the
Eastern Kentucky State Teachers
college, has. charged that selling of
teaching appointments and giving
them to relatives exists on a large
scale in the state.
