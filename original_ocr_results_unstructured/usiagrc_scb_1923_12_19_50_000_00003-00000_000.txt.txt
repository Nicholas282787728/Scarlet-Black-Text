Thinieth Anniversary Expected to
Draw Back Many of the 01d
Club Members.

In View of the fact that the Gl'innell
Glee club is now celebrating the thir»
tieth anniversary of Its existence,
plans are under way to hold a his,
homecoming of the members of the!
club in [last years some time in the
future or the school year About
commencement time. if the present
plans mature, it is hoped that a good,
number of 250 men who have been In'
the club will return to Glinnell to help
celebrate its successes

The Grinnell Glee club \VftS founded
in 1394. At that time their? was no
organized college glee club ill the
state, although mixed singing socie-
ties and an occasional quartet used to
give local concerts. The GIinnell
club came into existence through the
efforts of Rossiter G. Cole, a gradu—
ate of the University of Michigan, who
came to Grinnell as a professor of
music in 1392. Mr. Cole had both the
experience and the perseverance nec-
essztry to bring the new organization
out of the trials and discouragements
of its earlier years, and when he left
Grinnell in 1901 the Gl'innell Glee Club
and the Grinnell College orchestra
were known all over lcwa. The Glee
Club' s present director. Professor Da—
vid E. Peck, has been with the club
as dilectoI for twenty years and to
him it owes much of its development.

Local Club Will Apply for An
'Active Membership at the Na,—
tional Convention.

At the Convention or the Curdll
Fratres Association or Cosmopolitan
Clubs, which will tnke place on De-
cember 2628 at the University or In-
diana, Bloomington, indiana, the local
Cosmopolitan will apply for active
membership. The local chapter was
admitted into associate membership in
1920 when the National Association
was first organized. It is now entit-
led to make the application for active
membership, according to the {Kiwis
ion of the National Constitution.

The convention at Bloomington this
year has already shown signs of suc-
cess because a large number n! delen
gates, according to official report, navel
mettle assurance of being present
President Coolidge sent the following
message to the Convention:

"The plan of the Corda Eratres As-,
soclation of Cosmopolimn Clubs is cer-
tainly one which assures a. free nnd
general exchange of ideas among the
leaders 0! the intellectual community.
In making possible such an encour-
agement of liberal and cosmopolitan
thought, the organization can hardly
tail to render a distinct public ser-
Vice."

According m Hawkins Yang, Presi-
dent of the local chapter, Grinnell
will play her part by sending one of-
ficial delegate and as many visitors as

Dear Sir:

My attention was called to an article
written by Mr. James Fitz in the issue

discussion was the college band, past.
Present and future

In the main Mr. rim is right—it is
hard to maintain a college band, keep
up the interest after football season
and to have a good sized organization.
Unuuestionahly the instrumentation is
often uusatlsractory due to the chang—
ing of the student body every year
Financial support might help though

in past years, has come to be looked W0rk~two rehearsals a week, steady

upon as it good joke.'

rcveal From 1912 to 1917 (when the
war took away the men) it Gl'lllncll
College Band was maintained without
financial assistance from the institur
tioll and had regular rehearsals, cone
certs through the entire year. The.
officers of the hand had to work—
material was scarce but the band he,
came so strong that the college broughtl
