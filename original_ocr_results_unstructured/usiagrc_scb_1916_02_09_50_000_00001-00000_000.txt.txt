day morning at chapel. w lnle this

He did not arrive in time to present

announced.

. Lectures in Series.

The lectures will be six in number
on the general theme "Undercurrents
in American Society," four to be giv
on at hour chapels, all in connection
with the Fellowship Conference, Pres
fesaor Ross is it strong speaker and he
is being heard with great interest and
attention by his audiences.

Professor Ross will give his lecture,
“The Manhfade World,” before the
sociology classes Friday morning at
10:45, in the chapel. Everyone will
be welcome.

The passing of a frontier with free
land and loose economic conditions and
causing many changes in the economic
and social conditions of this country
was brought out in the first lecture.

"Twenty years ago we turned the
sharpest corner that American society
has turned since the abolition of slav~
ery, and yet nobody noticed it at the
time, and even today many do not
know what took place," said Professor
Ross in beginning. “What happened
was the disappearance of the frontier
which had been with us since the be
ginning of American society."

“If we had been a peasant people,"
said Professor Ross, "we would have
noticed a tremendous shock when the
frontier passed away, but being a rdtllr
er enterprising people the shock was
avoided; we began to work out later-
ally. in various ways we have man
aged to retain an element of elasticity
in the national area." Briefly the
speaker pointed ollt the ways ill which
‘more land had been acquired after the
frontier had passed away, hy regaining
the abandoned farms of New England,
on reclaiming poor lands in the :llidtlle
West, by irrigation, and by applying
the methods of scientific agriculture in
intensive farming.

With all this expansion and develop-
ment there was not enough land to all}
sorb the population, Professor Ross
pointed out. and so the'pendulum in
industrial life began to swing to man-
ufacturing. More nntl_more we have
come to consume all the agricultural
products we can produce, it was stated,
and to export large ouantit , of man-

was a splendid one throughout and the

GATES FUND STARTED BY
CLASS OF '00 WITH $1,016

Memorial Lecture Series Began
Just Two Years Ago.

The President Gates Fund, by which
the Gates Lectures now in progress are
made possible each year, was original
ly founded by the class of 1900 with
the primary object of furthering the
ideal of‘SOAtll service whlch President
tales so constantly empbas I.

This class has paid into the fund
at 016.50 in cash. Soon after the death
of President Gates his friends conrc
ed the idea of creating it memorial
fund which should be known as the
“Gates Lectureship Fund," the income
to he used annually in previting free
lectures along sociological lines. These
two funds have now been merged into
one, malting a total of $3,052.00.

Two years ago as the first lecturer
on the Gates Foundation, Professor-
Walter Ilauschenbusch of the Roches-
ter Theological Seminary, it personal
friend of President Gates, came to
Grinnell. Last year the Rev, Chas. E.
Jefferson, the brilliant New York
preacher, delivered the series.

Friday's game slip by with an idea to
avenge the defeat last month and make
a final desperate attempt to prevent
the destruction of all their hopes to-
ward a creditable finish in the state

Carleton Crushes Cue.

since Coe lost to Carleton, 20 to 16.
the night after the Minnesotans played
it hard game with Grinnell, and when
the visitors were minus their captain.
Badger, the Grinnell dopesters are pre
dieting the possibility of a victory over
the Crimson and Gold. With a defi<
nitely" settled Scarlet line-up and a
steady improvement ill offensive play
on the part of Grinncll, Coe‘s claims to
a. Conference supremacy is not at all
established until after their clash on
the local floor.

If Allies comes to Grillnell Friday
with even a regular lineup, it hardly
seems reasonable to give them the cou-
tesf. And if Grinnell wins this contest
and defeats Coc slle would be given a
much higher standing in the state than
first expected, in ruse the‘ Scarlet
team downs lows in the return game
with the Hawk s here, a royal “1in
up in the state title den .ion would be
the result.

The lineup for Gl'inllell which an»
heal-ed inst Cr letoll last Friday
seems to be the in t l‘llolt‘e for the re-
mainder of the season unless the un-
eypected develops, Hml’emr, as Car-
ney has changed his lineup in almost
every mum: this season. filly shift in
his men against Allies would cause lita
the surprise Pt lrcr and Seniors at
forward: are the best rolllbinatioli that
has appeared for t: ‘nuell this year,
and between the two the five should
oppose Antes with it (mltillllolls, as-
gressive offense.

As it goes without saying that Car-
ncy's five l)la)ed one of the best de—
fensive games Friday night that has
been seen on the Grinnell floor in
years, the (lope on the Alnes game.
with whatever lineup the Aggies
bring here Friday, must be regarded as

 

giving Grinncll an equal chance.
