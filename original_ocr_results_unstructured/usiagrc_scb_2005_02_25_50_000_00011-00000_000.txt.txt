More time needed for break arrivals and departures

The college’s housing policies are inrended to be reasonable, and
many of Lhcm arc. Throughout the year, though, there are irritants
that provoke angry, even indignanr responses from us students, such

ofthat into a short Friday night, because, LL 12:01 p.mL rhs next dLy,
our RLCs can deliver eviction notices—and $100 fines for not hays
ing left a minute before.

To expccr wchy srudcnrs to drive or ﬂy out of Grinrrell wirhrn
19 hours ofclosing time is absolute lunacy, especiLlly given the wide
scope of activities that have to take place in those last few, desperate
hours. At the onset of every break (here are students who ride on
the infamous 5:00 am. shuttle to get to the Des Moines airport.
Conan-randy, there are students who miss the same shuttle and who
get rides from their friends with cars but who were not planning to
drive until a few hours later.

Travel is possibly the greatest stressor in our lives—once exams
are ﬁnishcdewhcthcr we drive or ﬂy. For those of us who drive
ourselves to ger Lo our dLsrinLrions, gening behind the wheel wirh
bloodshot eyes Leer L week ofslcep deprivnricn and hours orsrudy—
ing is simply a disaster waiting to happen.

The policy regarding students’ return to campus is either better

traveling on spccrﬂc day: come hell or high
water for the sake of making our return to
campus more convenient for staff and adn‘rinisu‘ntor's, Our- concerns

forccastcr rolls us days rn adr ice that our one naval day (Satur—
day) is going to create white-our conditions on the roads leading to
Grinnell, what are our options? Well, we can’t arrive early without
begging for an exception, and while orccptious can be sought and
are ganrccl, nor everyone would rhink in all aheadinot eLeryons
knows rbLL exceptions would be made—and Housing would likely
not gimt 1,450 exceptions. We can’t arrive late (Sunday), so we take
our drances. Grinnell, no one should have to take chances with their
lives for the sake ofrcrurrring to campus.

Let's be reasonable and make travel to and from campus safer.
Please, Jen Krohn, don't give us the same schedule of eviction by
noon on Saturday, or one-day tmvcl windows. Housing procedures
for returning to campus from spring break this scmesrer give us ﬁve
days re pan our rcturn.This example ofa ﬂexible policy should be
cxrcnded to students returning from winter break as well.

Will the dangers of travel after midvsems and ﬁnals week he
recognized and students given more time to leave town? How much
more sleep deprivation and anxiety over something as fundamental
as travel between our homes and Grinncll must we endure? We've
already lost one of our own to this winter's blizzard. Let there never
be LnoLher loss of life due Lo somerhlng so avoidable—with greLrLr
ﬂexibility will come greater safety for all travelers.
