When David Paige ’09 was just eight years
old,doctors told him that by the time he ruined
22 he would be unable to walk. Now 21. not
only can Paige walk. but this August he hopes to
swim a marathon distance 0f262 miles to raise
awareness for Cllarcot Marie Tooth (CMT). a
disorder he has been overcoming his whole life.

According to the Charcot Marie Tooth As-
sociation, CMT patients slowly lose normal use
of their foot/legs and hands/arms as arms to
the extremities degenerate and the muscles in
the extremities become weakened because of
the loss of stimulation by the affected nerves.
Many patients also have some loss of sensory
nerve function.

Both Paige’s fathcr and grandmother suf-
fered from CMT, and since the disease [5 inher-
ited, Paige was tested and found positive for it
at birth. Even as a child, Paige felt the effects of
his condition. “Every kid wants to be the strain
gtst and fastest," he said. “I was always supcr
clumsy"

This summer, Paige has decided to take mat-
tcrs into his own hands, he will raise awareness
for GMT by swimming a marathon. “l wantcd
to do something over the top. Something that's
kind of larger than life,” said Paige.”1vmnted

frealun’ way to swim":

26.2 miles a a long freaking way to swim.
head swim coaeh Erin Hurley and Paige did the
math, and 26.2 miles transV
lates into 890 full laps ~ a fear
that should tako Paiga an es-
timated 11 and a half hours.
Bur Hurley, who is helping
Paige develop his summer
training plan, isn't worried.
“He’ll do it,’Y she said. “And
he’ll do it with style, class,
and pizzazz," she said.

Paige's two main goals in
swimming the marathon are
to raise awareness of CMT
and offer support to others who have it. He
hopes “to speak to people with CMT and say
‘don’t think for one moment that because you
have this disease you can't do something.”

CMT wasn't explained to Paige until he was
eight, when doctors told him that hed he wears
ing leg braces by age 17, and that by age 22 he
would no longer have the power to walk. While
Paige hates the cliché that having CMT forced
him to grow up quick he said, "it affected me
very strongly."

One aspect ofCMT Paige has had to adapt
to is the pain. “Most people who lose limbs
describe a phantom sensation, it‘s kind of like
that." But it doesn’t hinder him on a daily basis.
“You habituate to it," Paige said. “If I concene

trate on it I can feel it."

There is no known cure for CMT, and the.
host way to fight off the musclc deterioration
is to remain extremely physically active. “Fitncss
has always been this huge part of my life,"said
Paige.

Aware of what his son was going to face,
Paige's father was extremelyproaetive and taught
Paige to svim at an early age 7 the one form of
exercise that couldn’t be taken away from him.
“I learned to swim whenI learned to crawl," says
Paige. He was swimming compctitiicly by tho
age ot’six, and has been an active member ofthe
Grinnell swim team for the past three years.

“He is definitely one of our most energetic
and spirited team members," said Hurley, who,
aware of Paige’s disorder, has never seen it iii-r
pact him. “He's never complained. He's never
used that as a crutch," Hurley said. "There’s
never been any way that [CMT] has changed
his involvement with the team because he won't
let it."

Indeed, most Grinnell snidents, including
Paige's team members, probably had no idea
that Paige had any kind of disorder. due to his
active involvement. And while that attests to
Paige's succtss in combating the disease. it also
highlights the main difficulty in dealing with
tho disease, lack of awareness

Even though CMT is the most common
neuropathy (1 in 2700 people have it) very few
people have heard of it. This means that not
only is there a lack of support
for patients, but that there is
a smaller community work
ing towards a cure. Paige said
that most medical progress
has come from doctors who
have CMT themselves.

Paige also sees his success
as a huge wake up call to the
doctors who, when he was
just eight years old, laid out
his future as though it were
set in stone. “1 think there
is a global misunderstanding about this idea of
disability," said Paige. “That because you have x
you can’t do y"

Paige is where he is today entirely because of
his own strength and refusal to take his diagno-
sis as an inevitable fact. “I don't listen to a lot of
doctors,” said Paige. “I do my own thing. I live
the way I want to live.”

So far, support for the marathon swim
has been tremendous. “I’ve heard form people
around campus that have started talking about
it" said Hurley. She noted that the swim team
will be. an especially huge source of supporr.
“There are a lot ofpeople on the team he's made
a real positive impact on.”she said.

“I really appreciate the support that I've got-

ten on campus," says Paige. adding that the fa-
ccbook group he created to raise amreness for
his marathon has been ”a great forum for people
with CMT to talk about what it’s like to have
CMT with people who don’t know what it is or
have no exposure to it.”

“I think ultimately what this is about is
working towards building bridges and under
standing between people who have this disease

and people who don't," said Paige.

This summer, Paige also plans to create a
video documentary of his training. Students
are invited to join Paige’s facebook group and
check out the CMT Association’s website. But
the best way to help support Paige in shining
some more light on CMT? “Come. to Obermier
pool on August 30th," said Paige. “And watch

me swim."

Health-concious dining puts stop to Cereal Bowl

Annual competition between athletes eating massive amounts of cereal in jeopardy if new location is not found

When athletes have too much trot time,
weird things happen. Prom hosting Block
Party auctions to streaking on Mac Field,
Gtinneli’s athletes are good at
finding interesting activities to
pass the time. Among these ace
tivities, the swim team, soccer
team. frisbee team and cross
country team compete at the
annual Cereal Bowl.

Despite it being a time-hon-
ored tradition, the future of Ce-
real Bowl is in doubt as admin-
istrators, citing health concerns,
have prohibited future Cereal
Bows from occurring in the dining hall.

This year was the first time that Head
of Dining Services Dick Williams became
aware ofthe event. For reasons ofboth liabil-

ity and image, Williams believed it best to
not have this event take place. “We work very
hard with nutrition,balance and eating disore
ders,"said Williams. "Then to have an eating
contest where you're
gorging your throat is
not the image or the
presentation dining
wants to be about.”

Safety has long
been a Concern due to
the risk ofchoking; the
event has evolved over
time to address these
concerns. “They didn't
always use cereal,” said
dining hall siiptrvisor Lyle Baiiman. “They
used to use chicken patty parmesan. and I
talked them into switching it to cereal."

For many students, Cereal Bowl has

served as a way to escape the Vicious cycle of

classes at Grinncll. Held a day before Hell
Week, it has served as a pleasant study brtak.
“The Cereal Bowl has been going on since
before I started worlo

Swimmer Ian Warlick '10 said that the
Dining Service's decision to withhold from
hosting tho Cereal Bowl next year is due to
the “binge-eating" aspect of
the competition. “Dick Wil—
liams and I came to a com
promise," said Warlick. “We'd
have it in the dining hall this
year but next year, it would
need to be somewhere else."
Warlick mentions that next
year, the Cereal Bowl will be
more inclusive, brining in
mole sports teams and other
student groups.

“[Cereal Bowl] is more of an instinct
sport,” said Warlick. “You either got it or you
don’t."
