Peggy and Kina both mct most oi the
Soviets they knew through contacts at the
universities where they studied. Though
both were in classes with only other
Americans, their professors were Soviets.
and they made Soviet friends in the dor»
mitories, Both discussed their classes with
great enthusiasm.

Klna said, “I had three classes for an
hour and twenty minutes each and every
day These were in conversation, gram-
mar. translation, phonetics. literature,
and a discussion of Pravda (the Soviet dais

Russtan lifestyles,"

Peggy studied at Moscow’s Pushkin In-
stitute. a school designed to teach toreign
students planning to teach Russian in their
native countries, Like Kina, Peggy studied
grammar, literature, and Soviet culture,
but she also studied diiiarent teaching
methods. Her classes met four hours a
day, tive days a week and were also com~
posed only of other American students.

The jostling Japanese
(or braving Tokyo rush hour)

by Lisa Grant

Walking into a Japanese store for the
first time is a memorable experience.
Cheery cries of “lrrashalmase” from
every employee are surprising: most
Americans are used to silence, even
hostile suspicion iroin shopkeepers. Err
torts to make customers feel welcome is
only one of many ways that the tamed

The eitorts oi shopkeepers to help the
customer are extended iurther than just

smallest desire is worthy of the fullest at

Even within the household, different

family members, Not that this precludes
familiarity » it merely shows one's
respect tor the other tamily members.

Talking on the phone presents dit-
ficulties when making heads or tails out of
all the kego levels. But courtesy is a
lifestyle in Japan — it shapes the fun

silies, both women were able to meet
several Soviet citizens, Peggy thought that
these Soviets were very dliiererlt from
Americans “At iirst they can appear very
cold and ungiving, but after only a teiv
hours they are warm and generous, where
Americans will hold back

Friendships in the some! Union are not
as shallow as in the United States." Peggy
continued. “possibly because in many

 

cases triends are really all these people
have," Peggy admitted, however. that this
generosity may have been based partly on
the fact that she was an American. and
everyone wants to know Americans

Kina discussed other ditterences bet-
ween Americans and Soviets “Social ac-
llvities in the Soviet Union are ditiercnt

Classes, culture and collective spirit

than in the United States. Fol‘one thing, all
parties center around alcohol. Friends
meet at apartments to talk. and pretty
much anyone can come and stay the night
as long as they bring a bottle. This (the
alcohol consumptionl is dropping. New
drinking laws are in effect that make it
much more difficult to obtain alcohol, and
the drinking age Just went up from sixteen
to twenty-one."

There are Similarities between SOVlets
and Americans. For example. both Kina
and Peggy agreed that sexism is prevalent
in the Soviet society. Soviet women work
full-time both outside and lnSIde the homev
and Soviet men seldom do anything to help
them. -

Also. there is virtually no birth Control in
the Soviet Union outside of abortion, ad,
ding to the suppression or women. These
Sexist attitudes are deeply ingrained in
Soviet culture.

“Soviet women don't swear, pay on
dates or assert themselves." said Kina.
“Soviet men hold pretty oldrlashioned and
traditional views on Women’s roles."

According to Peggy, Soviet women hold
these views too. One of her teachers, whom
Peggy had considered an unorthodox, freer
thinking Soviet woman, showed a definite
preference for the men in the class. “They
could get away with murder. She assumed
