8uccéss for composer. Leich t/ing ‘

hy Rosa Michnya

Thwarting his father’s hope that
he would someday become a New
Vork Yankee ballplayer, Alan
Leichtling entered a far different
field and is now a successful
mower and associate professor

usic.

Leichtling‘s musical in-
clinations, apparent at an early
age, baffled his family of non-

isicians. Although he was not
Qanly discouraged trom pursuing
his interest. he failed to receive
much support. He recalled a hir-
thday card in which his father
expressed a wish not exactly in
keeping with Leichtling’s own
desiresithat he become star
pitcher for the home team.

Unsuccessful attempts to master
'the violin, viola, and cello, while in
cﬂmentary school, resulted in the
conviction that “some people and
some instruments were just never
meant for each other." Despite the
i ci that string instruments have
ﬁr been his forte, those early
lessons proved useful. He has
composed a good deal of string
music. ,

/In junior high, he made his “ﬁrst
(giact with a real composer,”
Allan Blank The music teacher
also served as his first source of
encouragement. By this time, he
n as playing the clarinet i d
composing music for that in-
strument as well as some “very
ambitious” orchestral pieces.

At New ’l’urk's illusic‘ and Art
High School, he studied music
history. theory, composition, and
p rforniance. Although he cons

tl/lthe instrument was “a means
to‘flll end, not an end in itself i' His
real interest was composing,

spending Zl total of seven years
aﬁhe Jutlliard School of Music in
.' [York. he earned a Doctorate
oi Musical Arts in 1971 He paid lull
tuition the first year of his
enrollment. but received
scholarships and grants cach
succeeding year thereafter. The
opportunity “to study under
composers Vincent Persichetti and

Roger Sessions with students from
all over the world was enriching.”
he added.

After a teaching tour on the East

§carlet

Coast, including Drew University,
William Patterson College and
Julliard’s Dance Division,
Leichtling arrived at Grinnell in
the fall of 1975, as an assistant
professor, From his standpoint as
a musician and an instructor, the
“Grinnell environment is ideal.”
He emphasized faculty relations
within the Music Department as a
positive factor, noting that all
members of the department “get
along iamously” and “like, trust,
and respect each other very
much.” He considered this state oi
affairs unique, having encountered
none of those “personality cun-
flicts, ego difficulties, or political
problems” that would detract from
his purpose in being here, That
purpose is music making and
educating.

Currently, Leichtling is teaching
three courses. So far this year, four
students have taken advantage of
the opportunity to compose under
Leichtling's tutelage. Overall, the
assistant professor finds his
students “bright, receptive, and
triendly." He noted that “it is
refreshing to say something once
and have it understood." This
quality is significant because
‘many students are “very green in
music," Lcichtling runs his classes
informally with an cye to imr
parting a “tremendous amount of
Iniol‘lnation in the limited time
allotted ”

Leichlling has composed for
various music organizations on
campus The Grinnell Singers, for
Instance, will perform his liook of
itrtrlrigals at graduation, The
erecoul‘t Trio has been especially
enthusiastic about his work In a
February recital, cellist King and
pianist Jensen performed Fantasy
piece it. it will be played again for
world renowned cellist Gregor
Piatagorsky. King’s instructor,
when he visits the college.

Ken Goldsmith, one member of
the trio, and Joanne Ritacca
combined to perform Leichtling‘s
Violin Sonata here in March. They
then gave two concerts in Wor-
cester, Massachusetts, and one
performance in New York’s
Carnegie Recital Hall. Lelchtling
indicated his delight With their
efforts and praised the two highly.

The response to his composition.
he said, was very good, “so much
so that a number of people in New
York have taken an interest" in his
music and want to arrange perr
tormances in Lincoln Center and
elsewhere.

Recently, the Seesaw Music
Corporation, publisher of 31 of
Leichtling’s compositions. Ins
formed him that his name will be
included in the next edition of
Who‘s Who in Music.

Prior to his arrival here,
Leichtling, a New York City
native, tended to think of the
midwest as a “mystery, a joke, or
nonexistent.” Once here, he “came
completely around” in his views.
He accompanied Goldsmith and
Ritacca on their trip to New York
and was appalled at the city’s
“noise. dirt. and paranoia”
Although exceedingly pleased with
the success of the Violinists’ tour,
Assistant Professor Eeichtling was
quite ready to return to Grinnell.
