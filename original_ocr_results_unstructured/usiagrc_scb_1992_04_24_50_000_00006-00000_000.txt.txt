LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Alumnus calls on
Grinncll voters

To the editor,

The lesbian and gay law students’
association at the University of Iowa
law school recently publicized a list
of state representatives who have not
yet decided whether they will support
S.F. 2201. S.F. 2201 is a bill that
would ammend the Iowa Civil Rights
Act to include protection for lesbians
and gays. They encouraged students
to call our local representative if s/he
was on the list. I noticed thath'nnell’s
representative, Dennis Black, was on
that list. When I called him, I was
pleasantly surprised to discover that
he was no longer undecidedihe had
decided to vote“yes.” Unfortunately,
he also informed me that diere is a
real chance he will lose his seat over
the issue. Evidently he has received

numerous phone calls and letters
(mostly anonymous, of course) vili-
fying homosexuals abnd threatening
his political life should he support the
bill. In addition, though he has no
Republican opponent in the general
election, he has an anti-gay and lesA
bian rights opponent in the Demo-
cratic primary this June.

Dennis Black will be on the
Grinncll College campus sometime
before the end of the semester to
campaign and help register students
to vote absentee en murse and send a
message to other polticians that the
support of gay and lesbian rights is
not political suicide.

To the editor,

I was extremely offended by Jesr
sica Moon’s letter to the editor in
April 17's Scarlet and Black. She
demonstrated an amazing lack of tee
spect for the Grinnell queer (gay,
lesbian, and bisexual) community.

To the editor.

Unfortunately. I do not know
enough about the life of Menachem
Begin to complete the haphazard pic-
ture painted by Mike Washbum in his
“Obituary". [do know, however, that
one vital piece of information over

vital particiation in the Camp David
Accords. These accords, negotiated
during the Caner Administration and
subsequently put into effect. returned

To the Editor,

We feel that Josh Ford‘s article,
“Can We Call You Pam?,” last week
was unfair to President Ferguson.
While we recognize the importance
of informal communication between
the students and the president of a
college, we do not believe all the
responsibility for such interaction lies
on the president. Why shouldn't stu-
dents take some initiative and talk
with President Ferguson? She is
around campus. In fact, several of us
have spoken to her at the numerous
theater productions, lectures, and

impaired for queer people. Further
more, Jessica Moon has no right to
tell the queer community how to cel-
ebrate and recognize their history. I,
as a bisexual student, am not looking
for her affirmation that I am doing a
good Job. It’s timethalshe and others
with similaropinionsrealizethatthey
are notdoing us a favorby supporting
our rights. but that it IS the just and
right thing to do. This is MY pride

conflict between Israel and its Arab
enemiescouldonlybeendedthrough
violence." I do not deny that Begin
participated in his fair share of milir
tary operations but it seems that
Washbum. in omitting the West’s
primary association with Begin, is
trying to appropriate Menachem Ee—
gin as a fellow anti-West, anti-estab—
lishment ally. I do not think it likely
that Begin would have wished the
same company.

Society fuels date-rape

To the editor,
Lets think. What causes date-rape
and sexual harassment and whatcan
Idotoprevent it? Whatcan each cfus
individually do to preventdalerrape?
Regardless of how different we as
Grinncllians think we are from the
rest of society we still have been
molded by society‘s mles. Girls are

submissive. Boys are taught to be in
control.

In this day and at Grinncll Col~
lege. I'll admit. things are noticably
changing. Woman are feeling more
comfortablestating their feelings and
needs, and at the same time, men are
trying to let go of the control. How-

 

taught (among other things) to be "n

ever, hard as we try to shake the way
society has formed us, it still is a
strong influence.

For example, even on Grinnell's
campus there are date-rape cases.
Even here, the word "no" is ignored,
misunderstood or not heard. Perhaps
the word's meaning doesn’t have a
chance to sink into the brain because
o" is too short and too commonly
used. "Getoffmel" mighthave more
ofanaffect. Or, forwomen whohave
trouble being that assertive, "Please.
get off me.” Then if he doesn't re»

Debate,

To the editor.

For the past two months, signs
announcing College Republican ‘
meetings and events have been disap- ,
pouring. As one of the largest and
most active political groups on cam- ‘
pus, the CR5 dcscrvc at least as much .
respectas PAFA,CBS, and the Cam-
pus Democrats are accorded by the ‘
student body. In other words, do not 4
take down our signs. If you disagree ‘
with us, fine. debatewilh your friends,
your profs, even (gasps!) a member -
of the CRs, but do not act like little .
children and destroy what you do not
agree wtth. Let the guilty parties be -
warnedthatthis matter has been taken ‘
up with Student Affairs.

Next year promises to be an even ,
more exciting and active year for the .

Students should welcome Ferguson:

Styrofoam‘s return. (In fact, some
students use them on a regular basis!)
President Ferguson has taken the ini-
tiative to investigate implementing
anotheralternativetoStyrofoam since
the former one—with the temptation
to “buy” a mug for 25 centsiwas
ineffective.

No, Pam Ferguson is not George
Drake.Theirstylesarevcrydifferent.
Mr. Drake was once a student here
and, therefore, may have felt more
comfortable“hangingout”inthedin~
ing halls, Grill, ect. In out View, Ms.
Ferguson prefers attending campus
functions and interacting with stur
dents and staff there. Let's let the
