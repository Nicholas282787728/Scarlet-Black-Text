Despite comprising a large percentage of the popula-
tion in the town ofGrinnell, students at Grinnell College
seldom get the opportunity to learn about the lives of the
townspeople. Gillian Hemme ’10 is changing that through
her onerwoman show Clean Start, which premicred last
Friday.

Hemme began writing the script for Clean Start as a
MAP (Mentored Advanced Project) with Shawn VVomack.
Theatre. during this past summer. During the process. she
interviewed around 20 people from the town about their
lives, from theirjobs to their general life experiences. She
then started picking out small details from the stories—a
couple orwords or linesgand began to write monologues.
Slowly, three characters—Beth, Hallie and Joyccistarted
to emerge, and Hemme contrived the plot ofClean Start.

“1 think the mterviewrng process was my favorite part
because I got to hear so many interesting stories and peo-
ple really opened up and were so honest and so generous
with their stories," Hemme said. “I felt really honored to be
trusted with that kind of truth from them."

one ofthe characters, Beth, is a loyal Maytag employee
who Hemme plays from before the closing or Maytag—
Maytag's headquarters in Newton, Iowa. closed in 200s,
affecting hundreds of employees from Grinnellito after
the company goes under. Beth strongly believes in the int
tegrity of the company and is sad to see the company go
down, However, she perseveres after the layoff and begins
to dream of a bakery and lets herself wonder about life’s
possibilities.

Hallie, another character in Clean Start, is a small busir
ness owner, who must make the life changing decision of
closing her store. Hallie’s situation reﬂects that of many
businesses in town, especially in the faltering economy as
oflate, though Hemme explained that the economy has not
affected the kindness of the business owners.

“For improv we do the 24thour marathon almost ev»
ery year and 1 would go out and collect prizes donated
from local businesses and people were always so generous,”
Hemme said. “I wanted to learn more about the people
who worked in town and who own these businesses."

Perhaps the most prominent of the three characters,
Joyce ages from eight to 87 during the show, as Hemme
plays Joyce as an eight-year-old milk delivery girl who ends
up in an unhappy marriage, then discovers her inner voice
through art.

Brenna Ross ’13, assistant stage manager of the show,
said the relarability ofthe characters is a big appeal.

“When Gillian [Hemme] plays Joyce in her eighties,
she reminds me of] a woman who lived next door to my
grandmother who I called my grandma Olga," Ross said,
"So that really struck me because I identify with these chart

actors and all ofthem reminded me ofpeople I’ve known at
some point in my life. They’re very real, they're not overly
theatrical in any way. everything they do, you kind ofwatch
and say ‘yeah, I know someone like that.”

Hemme explained that she was inspired to write Clean
Start after reading Studs Terkel's “Working: People Talk
About what They Do All Day and How They Feel About
What They Do" and having participated in community
oriented work previously.

“There was just so much strength in each of the indie
viduals I talked to, to carry on and continue going forward
despite setbacks and that resilience was present in the in-
dividuals," Hemme said. “I feel like just by everyone kind
of knowing everyone else there's a lot of support built in
to the fabric or the community which is really lovely to
Witness." 7

While each of the characters emerged from the inlet”
vicwees’stories, Hemme intentionally melded the different
stories to create her own characters.

“Each character is a composite of all the different peo-

ple I interviewed so there’s no onettotone match up her
tween the interviewee and the characters," Hemme said
“They said that they could see themselves in parts ofit but
they couldn't recognize anyone else and they liked that."

Hemme also explained that the show provided a way to
relate the stories otsecmingly ordinary lives to the greater
Grinnell community,

“I think it’s just really nice for people whose stories you
don’t necessarily get to hear all the time to have some kind
of outlet, some way to have their voice be heard," Hemme
said. “It’s just been really special to be given the gift ortheir
stories.”

Hemme will also have performances this weekend, to
night at 7 pm. and on sunday at 2 pm. and 7 pm at
the Grinnell Historical Museum—located at 1125 Broad
Street in Grinnell.Though tickets sold outlast week, those
