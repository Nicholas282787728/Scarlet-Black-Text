Every Lucky Strike is made from
the finest tobacco and only the
center leaves. Not the top leaves—
because those are under-developed
—not ripe. They would give a harsh
smoke. Not the bottom leaves—be-
cause those are inferior in quality.
They grow close to the ground,
and are tough, coarse and always
\Sandy. The center leaves are the
mlldcst leaves, for which farmers
are paid higher prices. Only these
center leaves are used in making
Luckies the fully packed cigarette
—so round, so firm—Jree from
loose ends. That's why Luckies
draw easily, burn evenly. And
remember—“It's toasted”—for
throat protection—for ﬁner taste.
