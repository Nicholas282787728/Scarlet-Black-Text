In Lineup

Working with a varsity toothall
bail squad of only 27, the smallest
in many seasons, Coach Ben
Douglas is facing a seven-game
season with a team made up
largely of veterans, but with :ew
reserves to call on in case in-
juries.

Freshmen will not be allowed to
play on varsity squads this sea-
son in the Midwest Conference,
of which Giinnell is a member,
G. Lester Duke, athletic director,
announced today.

At the same time, Duke pointed
out that the conference's decis-
ion could be reversed at any
time by a majority vote of the
confel'ence schools.
Louie Gonlas, last year's cap-

tain, has returned to Grinneli to

aid in coaching the Pioneers,

Douglas announced today, saying

that Gonias, who is expecting to

be called to the army before long,
will take over some of the duties
performed last year by Marty

O'Connor.

Two injuries have occurred in
the first week's practice, Doug-
las said. Jack Bredimus, veteran
guard, suffered a broken nose and
Paul Boat, half back, sprained
an arch, but Douglas is hoping
that both will be in condition to
play in the opener with Mon-
moilth here September 25 under
the lights.

Captain this year will he
George Bishop, a guard with two
years’ experience as a regular.

This year's team will lack hoth
exceptional speed and weight,
Douglas admits, but says that
most teams the Pioneers meet
will also have suffered from the
demands of the draft so that com-
petition in the conference should
be close.

One of the highlights of the sea-

son will be the game with the

U. s. Naval Pre-Fligﬂl: School

“B" Team from Iowa city at

Newton, October 16, under the

lights. Grinnell students will he

admitmrl to this game on their
sam fees, Douglas said.

Dean DeWitt, center, and Mur-
ray Richards, half back, hoth let—
termen last year have entered the
Air Corps, along with Ted Hel-
ler, last year's outstanding fresh-
man center, he said.

Other losses are Ev “Lefty”
Sory, eiicl onlast year’s team,
who is recuperating from an op-
eration, and Tex Kaufman, out-
standing triple threat freshman
back last year who is recovering
from a knee injury.
