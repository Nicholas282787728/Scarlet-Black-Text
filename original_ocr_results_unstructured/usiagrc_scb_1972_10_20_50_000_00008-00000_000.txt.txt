Grinnell soccer team salvaged a l-i
tie on a late goal by Lester Ose
last week. The Pioneers' home re
cord now stands at 1717], although
the squad won both or its away
games, Similarly, the Eucaneers are
now 3-1—1, their only loss coming
at the hands of U. or Wisconsin.
The confident Bucs, tresh on an

came trom the 23, But all oi this
went down the dmin when Lawrence

lErrinnell threatened to score eare
ly in the game when halfback John
Gray ran tor a tirst down, putting
the bill] in great position on the
Lawrence Hard line. Unlortunate-
ly, there was a tumble on the next
play and Lawrence recovered

Alter the game, Coach Bowers said,
“We need :I win badly.” He feels
that the Pioneers could be 3~Z at
this point. had it not been for
their inability to convert their of»
fensive opportunities into actual
points and deficiencies in their de-
fensive secondary.

of the first half. True and again
Eeloit rushes were broken up by
iullhacks Roger Kumier, Glenn
Cushing, Larry Goitlslein, and Karl
Von Orsdol, Beloit’s forward line
kept heavy pressure on goalie Tom
Grauman throughout. The aucs
tinaliy scored late in the halt when
Anton, their strong candidate for
All-Conference honors, broke
through the detense.

Down at the half for the first time
this season, the Pioneers faced an
uphill battle in the second half.
The Bucs continued to control the
hall, however. Late in the game
emotions began to show and the
action bordered on brutal at times

Dse s timely 30- yard goal with
three minutes remaining evened the

score, and it ended l 1 it was Use 5
fourth goal and sixth point (goals
hassists) oi the season. Pele Horo-
witz leads the team in scoring with
9 points.

Again it was the Grinnell defense
that kept the game within reach.
While the Pioneers got on only 6
shots all game, the Bucs took 47
shots. Grauman came up with 45
saves, Glenn Cushing accounting tor
the other.

Beloit‘s wins have come against .

Carleton, Ripon, and St. Olat, mak-

the edge. This week the Pioneers go
