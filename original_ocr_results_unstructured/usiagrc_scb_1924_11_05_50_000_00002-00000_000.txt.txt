THE SUBSTITUTE

The flurry over societies is
dying down as quickly as it came. The
bitterness, the hot anger, the tlood of
argument that has invaded the Quad—
rangle the past few weehs has all sub-
sided helore the plan
which has been suggested.

For a college
the development of the individual
along natural lines is supposed to be
one at the primary aims of education,
the new plan sounds almost ideal. The

“Without societies—what then?”

We‘ve maintained all along. in these
columns, that with the wits of the
college at work, something was bound
to turn up; but we scarcely expected
the thing that has happened. What
seems to be a workable solution has
miraculously appeared at the exact

Dibble Hall is now the undisputed

of Building one.
Only one game remains to be played
and that will decide who will be run-
