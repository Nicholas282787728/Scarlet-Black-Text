‘is not enough; it must be
shared knowledge.

Remember back in 1946 whenl
all you heard was, “Aint it
awful about the housing short-
age!" 1n Washington, senators
slept six in a sack; in Grinnell
three associate professors moved
into an elm troe overlooking
route six.

And while the homeless wan-
dered lonely as clouds, their only
joy came from tho advernsements
in weekly slicks that screamed
these tidings in six delicious col-
ors; There's a pre-fab in your
future! Things may still be rough
for' the senators, but, for tho
plucky three in the leafy pants
house, the millennium may be at
hand.
