We have nerer attempted to fennr
ulale 1L complete deﬁnition of Grins
sell spirit, lor it implies loo mucllto
be conﬁned to words, but we conceire
that one element in it is the feeling
which ehLers into the actions of an
alumnus who takes advantage of an
opportuniiy to work for his nhna
:narer by bringing his high school
pupils to Visrb her and get a glimpse
of the spirit which banks up her rep-
resentatiresonthefoot ball tleltl. The
man who brought a dozen ol his
young friends to Grinnell lust Satur-
day was putting his Glinnell Spirit
intoa tangible form and performing
some material Service for his School.

For three years the beauty or our
Campus now been seriously marred by
the building and repairing operations
which have been going on. Tile
building of the library, the laying of
new heating mains and sidewalks and
the recent erection of our new builds
ings have made the grounds a sight to
behold Bul. this was unavoidable
and no cause for complaint. yet many
have eagerly looked forward to the
time when the campus could be lei-e1.
ed off permanently and sad made to
grow on the big bare spots around the
buildings. This time has come at
last and next spring will see things
restored to their normal condition.
The thing that is cause [or reluon~
strance, however. is the ugly system
of water spouts that lringes the new
buildings. From every corner a
clumsey wooden trough, attached to
the spouting, Juts out from the form-
dation and makes the place look like
Tl branch of an irrigating sysleln. We
