Kohn's first point for peace—s
the total disarmament of Ger-
many and Japan—was given in
his Wednesday evening lecture
on Germany.

German “Personality"
There Kolln traced the develop-
ment of two tendencies in Gare
innn history.
The first was the leadership
principle. primarily a Prussian
trait, under which the individual

becomes naturally disposed to au-
thority, discipline, and strict mil-
itary order. “In Englandand the
United states," he said, “we
have become accustomed to man
city from the state: in Germany
liberty comes through the state.”

Secondly, the principle of unitr
cation, oi a community built up-
on the likeness of Germans,
Against this principle were av-
rayed certain centrifugal forces,
individualism and universalism,
which Hitler had to wipe out to
assure his German “superei‘ace”
idea. Universalism, entailing all
feeling or reciprocity, is well rep-
resented by Christianity, tor in-
stance. and Hitler has succeeded,
especially in the youth of the na-
tion, in Wiping out such systems
of the brotherhood of man,

Not willing to forgive the Ger»
man people ior all mill! to blame
Hitler for everything, Kohn stat-
ed that the demon people are
not the hapless victims of a small
inscist clique, as even some of
our national leaders would have
us believe. The problem is not to
“liberate" the Germans irom the
leaders who are supposedly im-
posing upon them an aggression
as severe as that delivered to
other nationalitia.

“We must not he too willing to
forgive and to excuse," he said
“In every German there is a lit-

much. We cannot change nation-

Convincing Defeat

“After the last war. the Ger-
man people were never can—
vinccd that they were beaten.
Thcy didn't consider the Treaty
or Ver. illes an unjust peace for
a conquered people, but they
could not convince themselves
and we did not convince them,
that they had been conquered.

"This time, the troops of the
United Nations must march down
the streets or Berlin and Tokyo.
That is a hard cure, yes: but it
is a hard disease,

“\Vo need Germany and Ja-
puirs industrial might, We want
to employ Germans and Japa-

the output oi their iactnries, we

they will not and can not be

United Nations until we can be
sure of a change oi heart in
them.”

In answer to a pointed question
as to how we are to know when
the Germans have changed heart,
Kuhn maintained that such a
question is easily answered by
watching closely the newspapers,
the pdblic lectures, and the com-
ments or Germans.
