rest of the Carnegie junior art
appreciation set and other repro—
ductions more recently presented
by the national committee for art
appreciation, of which Pres. John
s. Nolleu is a sponsor, will be
displayed.

The prints form the first unit
of a circulating collection begun
last year with the purchase of a
van Gogh portrait, which has
been hung in Carney house and
in Pine Tree place. Miss Sternteld
said.

All but one of the present
group are from the collection of
17 pictures presented to the de-
partment last spring by the Car»
negie corporation of New York
to form the nucleus of “a lending
library of art" from which Stu»
dents might rent pictures for use
in private rooms or cottage or
ball cluhrooms, she stated.

Framing has been ﬁnanced by
the Social Budget committee, who
selected the following subjects as
most suitable for cottage parlors
where the pictures are to hang
for the remainder of the college
year: (Cezanne, “Boy with Red
Vest"; Cezanne, “Rock Lands
scape"; “Degas, ”La Repetition";
Derain, “The Large Pine”' Hos

Indians Who
Rolled
in the Snow

Urged on by their Medicine
Men, stricken Indians of long
vanished tribes “treated" theme
selves by rolling in snow and
ice. Hopefully, but futilcly,
they tried to drive from their
bodies the “devil” that had
made them sick.

Now instead of Medicine Men.
we have Men of Medicine.
Their prescriptions call for
drugs, not superstition. That's
why we cariy over 1800 differ-
ent drugs, and have two regs
istercd pharmacists to com—
pound them. Bring your pre-
scriptions or reﬁlls to this store
and they will he filled quickly,
accurately.
