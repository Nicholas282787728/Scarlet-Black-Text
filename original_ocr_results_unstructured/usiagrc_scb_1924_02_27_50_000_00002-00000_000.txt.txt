STRAND PROGRAM.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday: Ex»
tra Special: “In the Palace of the
King."

In its photoplay version of r. Marion
Crawford’s novel of sixteenth cen-
tury Spain, "In The Palace or The
King," which will be the attraction at
the stland theatre for three days, be-
ginning Wednesday. Goldwyn has a
dramatic and spectaculnr production
of vast importance. It is worthy to
rank among the finest pictures of Lhe
year because of the tenseness of its
central dramatic situation, the nat-
uralness with which it has been dir-
ected and acted, the largeness and
majesty of its sets and the beauty of
its photography.

The novel is one of the most suc-
cessful of a long line of romances writ—
ten by this Amencan novelist. It be-
came very popular immediately upon
publication and was soon dramatized
and served as a starring vehicle for
Viola Allen.

The way to gel:
the ﬁnest shave

The Hinge»Cap is a sure way of identifying
Williams Shaving Cream. And Williams, be-
sides giving you the convenient Hinge—Cap,
will improve your shave in three ways:

First, (he lather is heavier and holds the
moistm’e in against the beard. Quicker and
more thorough softening of the beard results.
Second, the razor glides more easily through
the W illiams-sofiened board because Williams
lather lubricafes the skin. Lastly, an ingredient
in Williams keeps the skill in good condition
no matter how heavy your beard nor how
frequently you shave. In addition, you'll enjoy
Williams because it is a pure, natural white
cream without coloring matter of any kind.
Ask for it.

Look for the
Hinge—Cap
