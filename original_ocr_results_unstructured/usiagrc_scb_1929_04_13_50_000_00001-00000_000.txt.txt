TRACK IN GOOD bONDiTIoN

Sophomore Stars Are Favored
'To Cop Annual Meet; Kansas
Relays Next Week.

Aiter an inauspicious opening this
week. the weather man took pity on
the plight of the Grinnell trackmen
and permitted them to hold their
home meet as planned today. Air
though rain and cold weather pre-
vented strenuous workouts early in
the week the track is in good shape
for the meet today. it was probable
that some of the events would go in
good time.

To a large extent today's meet will
serve as the first serious time trials
of the season. Although the men
were timed over their dismnces last
Saturday, Coach Duke advised them
not to over exert themselves Today’s
winners may be looked to as probable
regulars on the Grinnell track squad
during the season.

Taylor, colz, Douglas, Humphrey
and Miner; are only a few or the men
who make it probable that the sopho-
mores will cop the session with little
trouble, kisser, Beck. McCully, MC—
Kee and ingram are bolstering the
senior hopes for a second place, Pel-
leiier and Mark varsity relay men,
Greene in the pole vault and Delong
in the hair hile may serve to aid
the juniors in boosting the freshmen
out of third place. it is unknown as
yet what the yearling men will do in
competition, but with Thomas to lead
his men, it is probably that they
will take their share of points.

Armour Tech has Jennings as a rank-
ing number one man, who holds the
Wisconsin title and is the ranking
college player ol the Chicago district,
Although he defeated Coggeshall in
Chicago last year, the Grinnell cap-

year should he one attracting na-
tiunnl attention.

The Grinnell nelmen have been
working out regularly in preparation

Honor G Award. Given
To Douglas For Work

Douglas, sophomore guard with the
Grinnell basketball team during the
past year, will, contrary to previous
announcements, receive rm Honor G
award for bls cage work during the
past season. Owing to the loss of
records on two mid~5easnn contests
it was believed that Douglas had not
played the required minutes for his
letter. It was later found that he
qualified with some minutes over,
however, and his Case was reconsid-
ered.

This will give the Pioneers four
veterans returning next year in

When asked if the proicsscrs at

"Oh, the professors are too busy for

The Undergraduate Speaking ex-
change was created iast year by
Grinllell Forensic, 1t w felt at the
time that the appropriation for lie
bate was too small to carry on an ex-
tensive schedule. Interest in dchate
was at a low ebb, the Harvard debate
being the only contest arousing any
interest. With this thought in mind,
Forensic promoted a plan whereby
Grinnell students were sent to the
leading colleges and universities in
the middle-wast to speak to the stUr
dent body on some phase of college
life and to spend several days on the
campus studying conditions prepara-
tory to making a report to Grinnell.
Speakers were scnt to the Univers
ties of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota.
Chicago and Northwestern. Knox,
Coe, Beloit, Carleton, oberlin, St,
Olaf, \facnlester, Western Reserve
and Hamllne were the colleges visit»
ed by speakers.

At the time these trips were tak~
en student government in Grinnell
was undergoing a reorganiz tion.
Reports by the speakers were incor—
porated in the reorganization scheme.
Last year the system was unilateral
in that Grinneli sent representatives
to other schools but no representar
tives were brought to Grinnell be-
cause of lack of funds. It is planned
this year to have students from oth-
er placcs speak to Grinnell students
as well as having Grinnell men speak
on other campuses.

Ernest Stowe, Russell A. Srnitb and
Laurence Lundcn are the three men
in school this year who made tours
last year and reported the results of
their visits in a special series of
chapel talks.

Weimer Says Natural Cliques Within
Grinnell Dormitories ls Detrimental

BY JOHN CANNING.

What event or sight at Grinnell
college appeals most to an under-
graduate exchange speaker when he
makes his presence on our campus?

Grioneil was host Wednesday to
the list ol‘ the visiting college
spokesmen, when Arthur Wellner oi
Boloit college, Beloit, Wis, talked
here under the plan inaugurated by
Grinnell Forensic last year.

Mr. Weimer believed that among
his many striking "first" impressions
ol Crinneil. the housing or men in
dormitories rather than in fraternity
houses was the most outstanding.
Wcimer is active in scholastic and
campus work at Ecloit, being a mem-
ber or Tau Kappa Epsilon social tra-
ternity, the varsity debate tcam which
toured the Pacific coast last year.
Delta Sigma Rho, national honorary
debating lraternity. Phi Betta Kappa,
president of the Beloit players and
business manager of the noundtabie.
college semi-weekly newspaper.

"I've noticed the formation of na-
tural cliques in your dormitories,
stated Wcimer in an interview. It
is true that college men will iustinct-
ively clique up. but i fuvor fraternis
ties because tlleytry to break up those
small groups, which undoubtedly are
of a selfish attitude, and bring all

 

together working lor the ‘spirit of thc
house.‘

"Then, too, at Beioit. or in fact any»
where that there are fraternities, the
house can choose just what pledges
they want to rush, wll' e here I uni
derstaud that the dorm tory system
does not allow that privilege.

“No, our chapters have only around
twentieth-e members, about half of
the number you liave'ln your ball
here." To the question as to “enter
the rratcruities at Beloit could be
”slangly” classified as scholars, ath-
lctes, debaters, members oi the tour
hundred, etc., he replied, "We try to
eliminate that. Well-rounded fellows,
thosc that do not specialize in one
phase ot campus life. ftre what we
strive for at Beloit."

Pledging at Belolt comes to the
freshman in May, at the conclusion
or their prep days. Thcy are segrer
gated with non-fraternity uppel‘class
men in the dormitory during their
first year, and. if pledged, move into
the chapter house when a sophomore.

surprising number oi prominent na-
tional social iraternitics. Tau Kappa

Debate Repetition of Discussion
Two Yams Ago When Teams
Clashed On Education.

Three Harvard men, who were in-
lerested in how they said it rather
than in what they said, discussed the
place of women Inst night in Har-
rlck chapel with three Grinnell speak-
ers who seemed to have delved deep
into the encyclopedia and Webster's
dictionary and found little which cor-
responded to the arguments from
Cambridge. Everything from the
Devil to the industrial revolution was
called to explain the emergence of
woman from the home,

The debate was more or less a
repetition of the one two years ago
when Harvard representatives came
to discuss education and stayed to
fall: about tariff. prohibition and
radios. J. Mack Swlgert, who met
Harvard then, was this time repre-
senting the East. His smooth deliv-
ery was a contrast to the unorthodox
methods of Brooks Otis, who, speaks
ing third for the visiting team. used
the Devil as this authority and ad
mitted that he had had "his moment."

Grinnell was represented by n Wom-
an in the discussion. Florence Stoaks,
speaking second for Grinnell, gave
the longest and most scholarly ad—
dress or the evening, It is the first
time in local history 3 eo-ed has ap—

peared in a men’s debate.

Swlgert Pleasnig

Swigcrt opened the debate for the
affirmative by establishing the point
that woman's leaving the home re<
moved the last check on mankind to
keep it from excess of materialism.
His speaking was pleasing and easy
to follow. it was characterized by
clever allusions and illustrations.

In a well—prepared argument,
Weaver pointed out the unmistakable
woman, and its implacatlons in favor
of a fuller life for her. Mr. Hui-d fol-
lowed with the points of the loss of
the cardinal virtues of Woman and of
the selfishness which her emergence
has caused.

Miss Steaks spoke oi the beneiin
to womnnkind from the change in
home lire. Better mental balance, ins
creased opportunity for personal de-
velopment, and increased self re—
spect and confidence were her points.

Brooks Otis with his nttrdctive
eastern accent lived up to the repiltaa
lion given hi inns at very unuthodux
speaker. His voluble speaking car-
ried the audience and furnished much
entertainment.

Phillips summed up the argument
tor the negative and brought some
clever rcpartee to play on the other
speakers. Swigert closed with a re-
buttal for the attirmativc,

Beyond a doubt the occasion was
somewhat of a disappointment to the
debaters and audience alike. The
audience exected something unusual
in debating, but demonstrated by its
eagerness to depart, during and at
the close or the aflair, that it was
disappointed.

The Harvard men seemed tired by
their travels. Watever the cause, it
is a fact that the Harvard team failed
to realize its responsibilities as at-
firmative speakers. The affirmative
team sets the pace. Harvard not on-
ly failed to set the pace demanded by
the question and expected by the
Grinncli team, but failed to recognize
the strong points of the opposing
case.
