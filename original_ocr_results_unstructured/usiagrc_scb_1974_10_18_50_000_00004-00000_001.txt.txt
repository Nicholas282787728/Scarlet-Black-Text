Radio piay to air

by Tim DeCoster

An experiment in drama and an
exercise in linguistics will be

in the south lounge, under the
direction of Sonja Darlington,
lecturer in German, on Friday
evening, Nov. 1 at 7:30 pm They
will present the German radio play
Traenme (dreams), written by
post~WW ll writer Guenter Eich,

The bulk of the performers are
members oi Darlington's com-
position and conversation class,
who are presenting the play as a
+2 project. The remainder of the
speakers were recruited during
weekly German table dinners.

Good speaking practice

Darlington stated that the play
otters excellent opportunity tor the
beginning and intermediate

Transformation

barlington ieels that the tran»
Siormation from radio to live
periormance has been carried out
imaginatively by the use oi visual
and auditory effects. She hopes
that the audience’s attention will
be rivited on the slides while the
dialogue will inobtrusively, yet
vividly surround the listeners.

A open reception will im-
mediately iollow the play, which
will last an hour. To save time,
only four of the total five dreams
will be performed. Darlingtun
emphasized that anyone with any
knowledge oi German or just an
interest in such a dramatic ex-
perimentation is invited and urged
to attend.

Seminar to explore
careers in sociology

by Eva Hierschbiel

The ins and outs 0! social work
will be explored in six workshop
sessions to begin immediately
following mid-semester break.
Sponsored jointly by the sociology
department and career services,
the conferences will feature
alumni-led discussions, based on
their professional experiences in
the field.

Six sessions are planned,

students to practice pronunciation
and realistic tonal inflections.

Aiding in the production is Willi
Possert, an Austrian student
teacher on campus iirst semester.
Together Possert and Darlington
have been meeting with the
students several hours a week to
help the performers speak the lines
with the correct reeling and em-
phasis,

Production oi the radio play has
caused a few problems. Darlington
explained that the south lounge
presentation really adds a medium
to that oi ear. To provide a visual
focus for the audience that would
not conflict with the original non-
visual radio play, a abstract slide
show was developed Brian Harris,
professor of German, worked with
Doug Halsey to create slides that
do not depict any actual scenes
irom the play, but rather help to

Daly eyes sexism as rape

by Kyle Schaub

Mary Daly, proiessor oi philosophy irom
Boston College, launched the ship of radical
feminism into a new space time, where “the
sexual caste system” and “unequal access to
physical and spiritual well-being” are left
behind.

Before taking oit, Daly elaborated on the
alienation of the iemale identity in a
patriarchial world. She relt that society has
“particularized, trivialized, universalized
and spiritualized” the image oi woman to
prevent active ieminism lrom changing the
current identity oi women.

l-ier examples clearly showed historical and
current acts of sexism, particulary those in
religion. Her detailed account of sexist

practices in the Catholic church stem irom
her doctorate work in religion from St.
Mary’s College, Notre Dame.

She stated that the phrase “God the
Father" equates the male with the Divinity,
leaving the iemale tar behind in status. She
then called tor the exorcism oi the external
God the Father, believing that women cannot
beneiit irom such a male deity.

Languagc problems

Language problems were also a concern of
the 1974 Gates philosophy lecturer. Daly
preierred to use ”rapism” in place at
“sexism," and “covenant” to describe the
bonding process oi sisterhood to promote
independent feelings oi anger, pride, love and
courage, She also saw the new radical
teminism operating on the boundaries oi
partiarchial institutions and universities, in a
space invisible to those outside the women's
movement.

According to Daly, the “quantitive leap“
demands being a radical ieminist since “just
a little bit feminist” only weakens the
movement while Still receiving the full
punishment irom society. The leap also
requires a new deiinition ot seli, the cosmos,
and the ultimate reality. To this cnd, Duly
praised the historical independent qualities of
the WltCh who demonstrates the charac-
teristics oi the modern radical feminist: “one
who questions everything, who has her own
thoughts."

Reactions

Audience reation to Ms. Daly ranged irom
hostile to active support. The most negative
response occurcd during the questionrandr
answer session when Daly said that she would
not accept any questions irom men; a policy
that she has iollowcd ior two years

ller poivcriul use oi loaded words such as
“rape" and “exorcism" to describe
traditional sacred institutions also made the
audience lecl uneasy about her mslstant
claims oi outrugcous sexism But as the
purpose of the lecture was to “bring to the
campus the very best of modern thought on
philosophy and region," Mary Daly more
than adequately stimulated debate by
delivering her viewpoint oi ieminis: iuturisni.

Misconceptions

Anne Abler, instructor in
sociology who helped organize the
seminar, ieels that many people
have misconceptions about social
work. “When most people think of
social work.” she stated, “they
think of the welfare worker.” Ms.
Abler explained that there are
numerous other occupations open
to students wanting to go into
social work.

Possible jobs include work with
retarded children, with family
health services, work in juvenile
courts, rehabilitation, community
organizations and even in various
businesses and industries. John
Adams,, director of Career Ser-
vices. pointed out that not all social
workers sit dismally by their desks
behind mounds of paperwork.

Grinnell and Sociology

Abler also feels that too many
students concern themselves only
with graduate school preparation.
One purpose oi the seminar is to
shown students how their liberal
arts education can be useful in
social work. '

Adams added that the seminar
will be extremely profitable in this
respect, especially since all the
speakers are Grinnell alumni. lie

Death of
a Legend

by Ellen Wright

With a pack oi wolves streaking
in pursuit, the greenhorn sled
driver urges his exhausted dogs on
in a Curdled frenzy. “Mush!” he
screams as the overloaded sled
careens through the Alaskan snow.
He turns, the cape of his city coat
flying, to pump out crazed rifle
shots. The sled topples, along with
the beautiiul lady passenger who
barely makes it to her feet as she
ﬂounders through the snow. The
wolves are closing in.

Only a legend

A likely scene? Considering only
the behavior of the wolves, no. This
incident from last Weekend's
Cinema film, ”The Call of the
Wild," perpetuates legends about
wolves’ hostility to man.

Wolf expert David Mech writes
that there have been no sub-
stantiated cases of nonrabid
wolves attacking humans in North
America, “On the contrary. they
are extremely shy oi man and
usually try to avoid him as much as
possible." (Maybe the movie
rescue by Charleton Heston was
unneeded.)

The realtimher wolf

After midsemester recess, the
Audubon Society will show “Death
of a Legend,” a film that breaks
through the massive misinv
iormatlon concerning the timber
wolf, Produced by the National
Film Board of Canada and the'
Canadian Wildlife Service, it will
be shown Thursday. Oct, 31. at 7:30
p.m. in Science 171 Tell a Canine

“Wlth one hand on the steering

how Mark Bristow created his

halt year trek across the States.

In an 5&8 interview, the young
Englishman termed the [our
screen production a “college oi
impressions along the road.”
which he asked the audience to
“treat like a Windshield." The four

worked as a “video roadie" for the

TV show, “The Groove Tube," a
satire on televxsion programming.

Alter depleting his savings in
Europe he began seriously to view
Mark's America as a potential
source of income.

Bristow‘s experiences have
given him a very positive opinion
