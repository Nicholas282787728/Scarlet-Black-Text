Draft forum sparks debate

by Jody Hellman

Over 400 people crowded into South
Lounge last Monday to listen to and
participate in a discussion or the pro»
posed registration for the military.
The meeting, sponsored by the
Democratic Socialist Organization
Committee (DSOC), was viewed as
successful by this organization and not
only presented many of this topic's
issues. but also showed the attitudes
present in the Grinnell Community

Planning and organization of this
meeting began January 24 after the
President‘s State of the Union ad-
dress, and continued Friday, Sunday,
and Monday. The DSOC is headed by
Danny Kadden, who also ran the Mon-
day meeting,

The meeting was open to the town
and members of DSOC believed many
town members were present at the
meeting. it was made clear by those
running the discussion that only facts
and major issues of the topic would be
discussed. Debates on these issues will
be held in the future.

Kadden opened the meeting with an
explanation of its purpose. Next, a
general overview of legislative action
on registration and the draft from 1970
to present was presented, Kadden also
explained the President’s proposal oi
registration very clearly by telling the
audience that Carter was preparing a
report on registration with suggestions
as to the inclusion of women in the
registration. While Carter has the
right to reinstate the draft, he needs
Congress to appropriate money for the
Selective Service and they must ap-
prove the inclusion oi women in
registration. It was constantly em-
phasized that the President has sug
gested registration only.

Hal Hillman, a member of DSOC,
spoke of the extremely mixed views of
Iowa representatives and senators.
For example, while John Culver told
DSOC that he was against any
peacetime registration, Jim Leach
was in the process of changing his
mind, and Roger Jepsen feels
registration may be necessary and he
will probably tavor it.

At this point in the meeting ques-
tions were asked and they led to Kad-
den‘s presentation of facts and figures
on military personnel and our
readiness and capacity to right.
Various members of the audience
pointed out the discrepencies in his
Statistics and effectively showed those
attending that the statistics change
frequently. One person from the au-
dience urged those attending to fully
research these areas of concern and
not to rely on others.

Bill Douglas from the Iowa Socialist
Party came to speak on present state
and county plans lor emergency
registration, He talked of the long
court battle to make these documents
public and outlined the recently made
public plans of Johnston County. Dur-
ing this outline he raised some ethical
questions about the method oi
registration used and the composition
of the draft board,

After Douglas spokchthe discussion
was opened to all who wanted to
speak, and a multitude of concerns
about registration came up. Paul
Volker expressed the need for a show
of strength through registration, but
vehemently opposed any lurther steps
such as the draft.

Professor Bob Grey brought up
some issues that were discussed intcr-
mittently throughout the meeting.
Grey opposes the dratt and registra-
tion, but bases his objection on the
lack of national and international need
tthis subject will be expanded on
Thursday, iii his convocation talk)
Opposition to this part of Grey's state-
ment came later in the meeting and
was based on a comparison between
our thoughts on Hitler before his invas
sions and the United States position
with the Soviets. Grey feels that
registration and the draft do not im-

pose upon civil liberties but pointed
out the discrimination against lower
class and lower educated people, For
example, enrollment in college can ex-
empt a person from the dralt This
point of discrimination brought up the
question of why only young ill) - 26)
people are asked to register; the au-
dience consensus was their better
physical condition

Professor Liahna Babcnel' brought
up the issue or women's rights and

aroused the most hostility from Mons
day night's audience, She lelt that
women should not be drafted as long
as they are not equal under the law.
Opposition to this came mostly from
women who seemed to leel equal with
or without the Equal Rights Amendr
ment and tlicrel‘oi-e thought they
should be included in registration
along with men.

The issue of conscientious objection
was well discussed and possmle action
lor anyone who does object to a dralt
was laid out A conscientious objector
cannot be exempt iroin registration,
but if the draft does come the
possibility of conscientious objection
must be considered by the govern»
ment. It was made clear that ill order
to be a conscientious objector one
must object to all wars and should
register a lettcr of his opinions with
his church and/or with the Selective
Service bureau. oiie speaker, a
lormcr preacher, suggested that those
who are considering conscientious ubv
jcction should possess a strong moral
background and belief in their posi»
lion, which could help strenghten their
position when interviewed by a draft
board.

A topic which‘drew much attention
at the meetings end was the United
States' energy situation. The concern

cenlered on El lear that the United
states would go to war over a Soviet-
imposed oil blockade, The ieelings on
this were best expressed by Calvin
Casady, “Be Chilled instead of killed.’
These arguments led to the idea that
rcduced energy consumption could
reduce chances lor war (thus no need
for registration).

The attitudes of the meeting were
generally in keeping with its purpose
Kaddeii kept all possibilities of a
