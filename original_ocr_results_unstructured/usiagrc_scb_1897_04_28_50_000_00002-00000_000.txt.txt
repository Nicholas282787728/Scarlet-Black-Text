ie interests of the college surier-ed
such serious inconvenrence on ac-
count of the weather as has been
true the present season. The tracl:
at Athletic Park has not yet been
sufﬁciently dried out to enable
the management to have it put in
condition tor use. consequently
the trainer and men both zuc- subs
jeet to great inconvenience. The,
baseball tearn has been iorced to
use the old drarnontl on the camp
us and since the heavy rains oi
last week even that has bt>etrnlrrr
der water, allowing no oppmhlllr
ity whatever ror regular practice.
The situation is indeed discoutag
ing and the men are haldly to
blame for the discontent to which
they are giving evidence. Some
shitt nrust soon be rnade tor the
present inaction may prove ofserr
ions consequence to the team.

has e‘a‘lled out a glcat deal of ad-
verse ’e'riticisnr‘ trorn students, ale

urnn‘i and‘lriends who are loyal to '

'the zrthlctieint'erests of the col»
lege. Coming as it does without
warning, and at the very opening
of the season it cannot but work
injustice to those who had worked
to’forrnulate and mature plans for
the season, and who are compels
rled to change these plans to meel
unforeseen conditions. On the
question of purity in athletics
there can be but one side, but as
to the time, spirit and rnanrrcr ol
instituting rules which serve the
most drastic conditions rrnposed
by these principles there is room
for honest dispute. Moreover.
this action was . taken without
awaiting the aid or consent ofany
other institution whatsoever,7an
arrogation of selfrsufﬁcient intler
pendencc very analogous to that
whereby agreat minority of the
American people, gathered unto
itself a considerable harvest of de-
teat and disappointment in the
last political campaign. With all
due loyalty to the college, we
must question its ability to re-
.tornr, single handed, the athletics
10f the state. Abundant evltlencc
has already been given or Grin-
nell's readiness to lead in the work
of reformation: it would be ad-
visable to wait tor a following.
Suppression is not the true solu-
tion oi the problem of regulating
athletics ln'the college.
