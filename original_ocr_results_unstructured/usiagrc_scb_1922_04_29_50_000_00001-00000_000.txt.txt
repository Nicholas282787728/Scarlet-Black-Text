"Czecho Slovhki " was the subject
of the third Harvard Exchange lec-
ture on the general theme "The New
States of Europe" delivered by Prof.
Robert H. Lord in chapel Thursday. In
opening his lecture the speaker stated
lthat Czecho Slovakia is considered the
most thoroughly constructed, the best
governed, and the furthest advanced
politically, and economically of all the
new states produced by the war. This
new state has an area very near the
same as that of Iowa and a popu-
lation of thirteen and one half mil—
lion. It is made up of three differ
ent peoples, the Czechs, who include;
the people of Bohemia, Moravia snd‘
Silesia, the Slovaks, and a few Carlin—A
tho Ruthenians, all of whom belong to
the West Slavic group of people. The
people are closely related—language
and religion, the Catholic faith prc-,
dominating although there is a strong
Lutheran minority ln Slovakia. All
the nations have had separate histol'r
ies and unity was not generally can-

ceivcd until early ln 1913,

with these elemental facts estab-
lished Professor lord went on to rc-l
view the history of the different peo—
ples. The Czechs. of whom the Ear
hemians are the most prominent have}
had a very tragic history. The dds.
vanco guard of the Slavic world, andl
surrounded by Germany they have had i
a hard struggle to keep their nation—
ality alive. one of their main prob-
blems has been the dealing with the
Germans who settled on tho borders
of their country. The 19th century
saw a great revival of the nationalistic
movement and the World War brought-
tha opportunity for freedom from
Austrian domination and the unldca;
tion of the Slavic peoples. Czecho Slo-
vak unity was consummated in
America by an agreement at Pitts-
hurg by a number of patriots that in
case the Allies should emerge victori—
us the Czechs and Slovuks were to
form one united and independent
State. Their aim was realized in 0c-
toher of 191E.

According to the speaker, the Ruth—
cnians a simple and backward race of
people were united to the State as
the most practicable method of dis—
posing of them.

Friction has developed between the
Czechs and Slovahs because of psy—
chological differences in the two races.
The opposition of the Czechs to the.
teaching of religion in the schools
and thc lack of not on the part of
the numerous c ch officials have
been sources of scoi-d. Thc original
plan was for a dualistic state but the
Czcchs have not carried this out,
maintaining that dualism would prov
the ruin of the state. The new state
is also confronted with the problem
of dealing with the one million Iiun-
garians and thc thrcc and Ono half
million Germans who havellcellmcol'rl
paroled in the State tor gcogi-apltic,‘

The hope lies in the fact that l-lough-
ion Will of Iangan Hall and Robert

been constructed from building 1 to

Romanticist Tries to Ignore the
Harsh Facts of Life Says - 1
Griffith 1n Chapel,

In the second of the series of Senior
chapel talks Professor D. D. Griffith
Spoke of the great tendency toward
realism in literature today. "There
are two types of people in the world
today,” he said, “The romantlclst and,
the realist." The romanticist is the
idealist and gets away from the dull
and commonplace things of life by gar
ing into the imaginary world of ideal-

'ismr The realist is the man who sat-

il‘izas society and seems, to the ra-
mantlclst, to be trying to destroy
idealism. But this is not so; he is
simply facing the facts of the present
as they are and seeking to make them
better by pointing them out to the
idealist who trys to ignore their exis-
tence, ,

Sam-e has always appeared at the
most cn’ticdl periods in histury; at
the times in which greatest progress
has been made; and it has been a
great factor in bringing about this
progress but not the whole causc. Ra-
malice has helped for it has kept alive
the desire for better things. Sittil'e
drives men lnto action to reach these
higher planes of civilization. it is not
the sign of. a deteriorating age, as
many people think, when satire be-
comes general. It is a thing vital to
the maintenance of the vision of good
——tbe thing that keeps us from settling
into a rut.

Professor Griffith asked the student
not to idealize that which he has
learned nor the way in which he has
learned it;in other words. not to bc mo
‘Smugly Satisﬁed with himself, He
must follow his ideal and apply it to
the problems that confront him but

at settle down satisﬁed with the rall-
inc of life.

In Conclusion He said that romance

HS beautiful, but, truth can never spnll
|that

beauty; and it is only the
truth which Ihe realist sceks to pre-

Popularity of “Strictly Conﬁdcn.

l tin!" Not Based on the

Name Alone.

Seals go on sale at one o'clock
Tuesday at the Colonial box office
for the biennial Caloca-Institutc play.

i“Stl*ictly Confidential." This is the first

CitlcocaJnstitute play for the present
college generation, the last one "The
Admirable Cl-ltcllon," being given four
years ago.

"Strictly Conﬁdential" is one of the
most popular plays of the last decade.
It attained great popularity in Eng
land as ”Fanny and the Servant Prob-
lem" and later in America as “Strlct-
ly Confidential.” The servant prob-

Tbe producers
who made the change in nomenclature
for publicity purposes were not right
as it is the play itself and not the
name which has given it popularity.

Although ‘Stl‘lctly Conﬁdential” is
an English comedy there are plenty of
real American laughs in it. Jerome K.
Jerome, the author, seams to know
how to keep both Americans and Eng.
lish amused which is well illustrated
by his continued popularity as a
playwright in both countries, especi-
ally in America.

The play has been in the process of
rehearsals for over four weeks and is
in good shape for the ﬁnishing touches
which will be put on this week. Prof.
W. H. Bridge has had charge of re-

. hearsals.
