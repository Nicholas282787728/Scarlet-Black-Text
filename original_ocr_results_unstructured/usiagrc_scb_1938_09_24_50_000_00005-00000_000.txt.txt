Meels Monday

Editor Will Make
Appointments to
Fill Vacancies

Preliminary plans for the Cyclone,
new student annual, will be dis-
cussed at the first meeting of the
staff to be held Monday at 4:30
pm.

Due to the failure of Ralph Hale,
Junior editor, and Jean Eckford,
copy editor, to return to school
this year, and' Challes Bear, assis-
tant editor, being classified as a
senior, several staff vacancies now
exist which will be filled by ap-
pointment next week, according to
Carolyn Bludorn, editor.

To Name Picture Editor

A picture editor will also be
named at this time, she said.

“Juniors, including transfers, exr
pen‘enced or interested in any line
of work on the annual, are eligible
for these positions and should see
me before Wednesday." Miss Blud~
orn stated.

Will Feature Pictures

The Cyclone of 1939 will feature
pictures, making it necessary to
secure an unusual number of good
pictures, Miss Bludorn said, adding
that this would call for coopera-
tion on the pait of the student
body when the staff cameraman
asks for shots

George Fletcher has been ap-
pointed staff photographer, and
Wesley Davies has been named art
editor.

The art staff is now working on
an original two»color padded cover.

Nollen Urges Cultivation of
Wider Outlook, Imagination

Uses Gary Cooper
As Basis of Talk
At Convocation “,v

Gary Cooper's college oarecr fea-
turing average grades and no place
on athletic teams r. in the drama
cliib, furnished t 2 theme With
which Pres. Johl 'Nollen greeted
the 800 students at Grinnell‘s o_
cning college :onvocatlon Thur
day morning.

Using Cooper‘s own statement
of what he got out of college7
“Life at ,Grinnell opened up a new
world o me. It gave me a far
wider range of interests, quickened
my imagination, and awakened me
to ‘uic problem of a career. And
this may be the most important of
it all, it brought me my first we
lndncel"7Nollen said:

“illel‘ Outlook.

"LE Cowboy Cooper, that was
what he was called on this cam-
pus, got all of these values out of
a not too brilliant residence hcre,
each of you may gain at least as
much. ,A wider outlook, stimula»
tion of imagination, the sense of a
career, romance, these are four
real values which it is quite worth
while to cultivate. And they are
all part of a process of liberation
which ought to grow out of what
we call a liberal education."

Spirit oi Democracy.

The speaker then took issue
with what he termed the romanti-
cism of the Declaration of Inde»
pendence in its statement that all
men are born free and equal, and
said:

“All experience teaches us that
children come into this world bond
and unequal, We conquer liberty
by gaining an ever wider outlook,
the mastery of new forces, and the
opening up of the new worlds.

World of Faith.

“Gary Cooper says that Grinnell
opened a new world to him and
quickened his imagination, imag-
ination creates a new world of
faith and hope. This faith and
hope reaches out beyond what is
to what may be, and is the essen-
tial spirit of democracy. When
this faith fails, democracy perish—
es.

After pointing to the perils con-
fronting democracy, President Nola
len turned to the fourth item of
Cooper’s statement, romance.

Divorce, an Ev' ,

"That, too,” he said, “is a coma
mon experience in college life and
is as wholesome as it is common,
The old taunt that a coeducational
college is a match-factory calls for
no apology. I suppose there are
fewer domestic disasters growing

5:

out of college romances than would
be found in any other group of
men and women. Divorce is be-
coming a terrible evil in this coun-
try, but it is almost unknown
among families that have grown
out of acqualntance at Glmncll.
Thc coeducational match factory
probably produces more marital
happiness and family stability than
any other institution on earth."

Misuse of Liberty.

The speaker warned, however,
against the misuse of liberty for
romance.

“Freedom has its own laws."
he said “The old opposition be-
tween liberty and license still holds
and always will. The rule applies
to all human relations. There are
always a few students too imma-
ture or too selfish or naturally too
gloss to recognize this, You can
,always tell them by their peculiar
habits; you will see them brazenly
displaying their subslluman affocr
tions by walking about before the
public gaze looking for all the
world like a pair of intertwined
monkeys. Two things are wrong
with such a picture; these mist
guided couples are an offence to
all sensitive observers, and they
give a totally false impression of
the essential decency of student so-
cial life. No gentleman and no
self»respective woman can be found
thus offending the standards of
cl‘lllized social behavior.”
