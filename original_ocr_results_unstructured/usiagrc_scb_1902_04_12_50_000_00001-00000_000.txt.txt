FIGHTH ANNUAL TOUR.

Glee Club and Orchestra Make a Success-
iul Trip in the Southern
Part oi the State.

The eighth annual trip oi the
Glee Club and Orchestra is a thing
of the past, and in the minds oi
the members is the knowledge
that they contributed what they
could to one of the most success-
ful trips in the history of the or»
ganizations. Theﬁrstconceltwas
given at Washington, Friday.
March 28, and was followed, in the
order named, by concerts at Fair-
iield, Osceola, Creston. Corning,
Shenandoah,ClarindaandVillisca
Except at Fairﬁeld, the houses
were very satisiactory. especially
so atCreston,Corning,Shenandoah
and Clarinda. The experience at
Fairﬁeld will long be remembered
by all. particularly by Manager
Dickinkon, The whole blame for
the Fairﬁcld misfortune rests with
thecommittee oithe Young Men's
Christian Association of Parsons
College, who had the local manager
mentoitheconcertincharge. Ale
most nothing had been done to ads
vertise the entertainment and no
eﬁfort at all made to dispose of
tickets. By the aid of handbills,
and the generous work of the
“squirt” band, a small but appre-
ciative audience was attracted to
the hall, whercan excellentconcert
was given.

At all the other places the cone
certs were received with much en—
thusiasm, nearly every number be.
ing encored. and some at them
two and three times.

From the standpoint oi adver-
tising the college and bringing it
intocloser relations with people in
a section of the state from which
Grinnell draws very few students,
the tour was eminently successful
Whether or not any students will
come to Grinnell asa result oithis
trip remains to be seen, but there
can be no doubt that there isa
much friendlier feeling for Iowa
College, on the part of the people
inthe southwest corner ofthestate,
than there was before the Glee
Cluband Orchestramadetheirtrip.

One of the most pleasant fea-
turesoi the trip to the members oi
the Glee Club was their appear-
ancebeforethehighschoolswhere~
evcr arrangements could be made.

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, APRIL 12, I902.

The high schools at Corning and
Clarinda were especially enthusi»
astic in their reception olthe club.

The arrangements for this trip
were unusually hard to make. and
no rlittle praise is due Manager
Dickinson for the very successful

outcome.

MALE CHORUS FOR COMMENCE-
MENT.

It is proposed to give Max
Bruch's “Frit/L/of" in connection
with the “Hiawatha” at the com»
"Frz'l/zjo/" is
an old Norse saga, which Bruch

mencement Concert.

has worked out in musical form
for male chorus with baritone and

soprano solo. The chorus parts

are remarkably interesting, and
rich in the superbly heroic effects
to which male voices are so well
adapted. Using the Glee Club as
a nucleus, it is hopcd that a chm-2.5
of irom iorty to sixty voices may
be brought together, that the work
may begiven with asmuch breadth
and dignity as possible. The in-
terest of college men in such work
as this is presupposed, both for
the sake of this particular work by
Bruch. and by reason oi the iact
that those who have sung in this
chorus will stand a far better
chance at the Glee Club examina-
tion this coming Autumn. Ex-
amination for admission to the
Frithjoi chorus Will be held in the
rooms of the School of Music
Monday evening at seven o'clock.

CIRCULARS WANTED.

In issue Number one oi the
Iowa college circulars the direct
ory was inserted. These were dlS~
tributed mainly among the stun
dents. Since the issue oi the sec»
ond and third numbers, calls have
been made from high schools and
libraries throughout the state ior
Copies of the ﬁrst circularin order
that their ﬁles might be complete.
The supply oi these has been ex-
hausted and in order to meet the
demand the president asks that ii
the students have any extra copies
oi Circular One or will part with
their own copies, that they bring
them to his ofﬁce, The catalogue
will soon be published and will
contain the directory oi the stu~
dents.

 

" TRACK SEASON OPENS,

Eriei Glance at the Prospects oi the
Dinercnr Teams, —Ames Seems
to he in Lead.

As spring track work begins
Iowa colleges are looking about
to see what prospects their sister
institutions will have in thecoming
meets. Of the members of the
Iowa Intercollegiate Association
Grinnel‘r has lost Iewest 'Varsity
men, Anles loses Lamb. Porter
and Gidley but probably on the
whole has as gooda chance as
any school at the present time.
Peck will run the sprints. her disr
tancc men will be stronger than
last year and to them will be
added Cave, winner of seconds in
mile and halt-mile at last year’s
state high school meet and it is
also, rumored, Drees, who two
years ago won both races at the
high school meet. Lytle can be
relied upon ior points in the
hurdles and broad and hop step
and jumps. Cave is also a strong
discus thrower. while Hanger,
Scltolty and McClure are all good
men in the weights, ‘
’ At Iowa City the outlookis not
promising to friends oi the Uni
versiiy yet enough high school
and college athletes always attend
to make a showing. Anderson oi
Iowa and Lytle of Aines will
probably be the best hurdlcrs
among the schools Grinneli is to
meet, Drake hasa good nucleus
tor a strong team though she will
missChanning Smith andSellardsr
Yell is good ior ﬁfteen points at
any meet in the state when he is
in condition. while Emerson and
)aggard will win points in the dis-
tances. Several new men are
showing up well but cannot be
relied upon as sure point winners.

Simpson has her weight and
long distance men but has lost her
high jumper and must develop
material it she makesagoodshow-
ing at the state meet. Cornell
will have George Dobson in the
bicycle races and, Guy Dobson in
the weights and pole vault. State
Normal has lost Jerry Wolie but
can count on points in thejumps
with Abel. Carmen and Streff.

Grinnell is 01 course interested
closely in the men in training tor
the home meet here Of last
year's 'Varsity point winners,
