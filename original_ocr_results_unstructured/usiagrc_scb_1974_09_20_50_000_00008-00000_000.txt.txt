Boosters win 5-1

by Dave Calvert

CEDAR RAPIDS, IA.7Dave
Wynberg scored two iirst half
goals in his first college level
soccer game here Saturday to lead
Grlnnell to a 5-1 trouncing of the
Coe hooters. Wade Lee added two
more tallies on penalty kicks and
Peter Shearer iced the contest with
a fast break goal late in the at»
ternoon -

The victory took on a Pyrrhic
quality, however, when senior cor
captain Mark Hanisch ivas toppled
early in the second half with a
broken leg and dislocated ankle.

With the score at 3-0, the hard
working fullback got involved in a
mix-up in front of the Grinnell goal
and fell down hard on his left leg.
After being carried offthe field and

,taken to SL Luke’s Hospital here,
Hanisch underwent surgery on the
ankle.

Back on campus now. he will be
in a cast [or at least six weeks,
Haniscli is out [or the season.

Strong lirst hail

Grinnell came out fast as the
game opened before a sparse
opening day Coe crow , Rapidly
moving the ball downl'ield, the
Pioneers kept offensive pressure
upon the Kohawk defense
throughout the first half. Fresh-
man goalie Gary Frulnkin, who
handled himself very well
throughout, was forced to make

only two saves in the entire half.

Wynberg scored his first of the
day midway through the hall on a
cross pass from Shearer. Shearer’s
lefttod‘lgl’lt liner connected with
Wynberg’s head and nestled in the
net.

Wynberg’s second score followed
closely, as he took a pass from
freshman Mark Bailey and laid it
in the right side of the goal.

Despite relaxing somewhat in
the second stanza, the squad was
able to maintain the earlier
pressure, and Wade Lee cashed in
on two Coe penalties in lront of the
Coe goal for two more points,

Aftcr Lee‘s points were put on
the scoreboard, Pfitsch substituted
freely None of the Pioneers were
overly disquieted when the
Kohawk captain John Bruton
headed in a Bee Corner kick to spoil
the shutout snort, ,

Shearer's goal made it final, at or

that Shearer has Scored on opening

History was made at Ward Field
Saturday as the first formal
women’s cross country meet ever
at Grinnell was held in conjunction
with the regular men’s meet, in
honor of the occasion, both the men
and women Pioneers easily but
distanced the respective William
Penn squads for a double win.

While both the men and women
won handily, the men came up with
the most spectacular showing.
Dave Raub, Torn Howland, Bob
Shields. and Neal Klergerrnan
grabbed the top four positions,
Raub clocking a 21:26.6 over the
four mile course. Tim DeCoster, a
freshman running prospect,
finished ninth.

Grinnoll took the dual meet by
19-35, apparently confirm’ g
Coach Ray Obermiller's earlier
contention that his team would he
especially tough in dual meets.
Oherlniller expressed, at that
time, apprehension over the
several upcoming larger meets, or

, invitationals, citing the lack of
teani depth

The newly recognizer]- women’s

team did exceptionally well also.
First year student Christine
Stidley finished first in the 1.5 mile
race with a 9:35. Other Grlnnell
finishers were Marian Stevick,
third; Bertie August, fourth, Judy
Wiegel, fifth; and Lourie August,
eighth.

The women came outon top of an
8-15 score, making them unr
defeated, and the “team to heat."

Luther Invitational

One win does not a season make,
someone said a long time ago, and
this applies right now to cross
country at Grlnnell, The men and
women harriers are off tomorrow
to the Luther Invitational in
Decorah, Ia.

Although there is no chance, 1
repeat, no chance of either squad
coming home with the Invitational
crown, Obermiller is looking for
some strong individual showings,
particularly from top man Raub.

Raub was Grinnell’s top finisher
last year at Luther, finishing 50th
in the extremely strong field. The
meet draws teams, by invitation
only, from several states in the

. general-lowa vicinity.

IM's keep on rolling

by Chris Sodonia

IM football started its second
week of the season on Wednesday,
September 11, with the first
shutout of the year. Dibble-Cowles,
last years champs, blanked a weak

Main-Mears squad 16-0, In the
other game Younkers, led by the

fine play of Dan Hoft, creamed a'

poor, understaffed Off Campus
team 4072. ,

On Thursday, Sept. 12, turbulent
weather kept Clark-Gates and
Norris away, giving Loose and
Langan-Smith forfeit victories.

Last Monday, the Cleveland-
James Machine rolled over Dibbler
Cowles 18h. Cleveland-James was
paced by a torrid passing attack,
led by QB Rob Holliday, and Randy
“Hands” Gillenwaters’ two touch-
down grabs, and a strong defense
anchored by Marvin “Bad News’I
Barnes. In the other contest, Reads
Haines, behind the fine play of
halfback Dave Guittar, and
defensive lineman Arnie Peters,
crushed a poor MainrMears squad
28-6. L

On Tuesday, a supercilious
Read-Haines team was crushed by
a fine Younkers squad, 34714.
Younkers was again lead by Dan
Heft, who bafﬂed the Read-Haines
defense into many costly errors.
The loss dropped Read- Haines
from the undefeated ranks leaving
Cleveland- James the only un-
defeated team The other Contest

was forfeited by Main-Mears to
Norris,

0n north campus, the team to
beat is Younkers, with Clark»Gates
as a close second, while on south
campus, Clevelanduames seems
to have a slight advantage over
both Loose and ReadrHaines.
