Inside this Week’s S 81 B

The very talented Ruby Dee and Ossie
Davis are here this weekend and Antonio
Baciero will finish his residency here with a
concert tonight at 8 pm. in Herrick Chapel.
Take a look at the Entertainment section on
page 11 for more details, and don’t miss out
on seeing these gifted visitors. (There are

‘ also movies and a schedule of Slavic
Weekend events.)

In Campus News, we feature stories on the
CSL’s decision to delay action on a lounge
furniture policy, information on SGA fund
ing, a look at the Student Advisor program,
and the interesting results of a recent survey

about college social attitudes in the past and.

present. Start reading on page four,
Our Focus story this week is on the six
candidates running for the office of SGA

from the editor

president. You’ll find quite a variety of
characters spread across pages eight
through ten: Paul T. Carter, Chris Nylander,

. George Turnbull, and Paul Volker all have

varying degrees of experience in student
government, while Andy Miller and Lu Anne
Shearer are relative newcomers. They have
different views on the issues, and two of
them don‘t have any views at allaat least
for the time being. It makes for dull but in-
formative reading if you‘re planning to vote
on Wednesday, Feb. 20. The balloting will
take place in the post office, and you’ll no
doubt need your ID.

By the way, we haven’t been getting much
in the way of letters to the editor these past
few weeks. How about scribbling a few lines
down, typing them up double-space, and
dropping them in the 5&3 box in the P0.
