The "Iowa College Alcove."
Frz'lndx r/ m Col/tgc:

The "Iowa College Alcovc” has
been opened in the College libra-
ry as the repository of College
history. Our next work is to ﬁll
it.

The history of Grinnell, of Pow~
eshiek county, and of Iowa. is so
interlinked with that of the Cole
lege and with the life work of the
College founders, that this Alcove
will be the receptacle of works on
local and state history also.

We now ask for contributions
ofmanuscripts,newspapers, maga-
zines, pamphlets and hound vol—
umes, which contain or illustrate
such history, or at least for corre»
spondcnce concerning such mate-
rial as its owners may be willing
to contribute,

Chief emphasis. however, is laid
on the history of the College and
of its special friends. State or»
ganizations are creating rich trea-
suries of state history; it is left
for us to make special and ade-
quate provision for our own. We
accordingly ask forall valuable no-
tices of persons belonging to
either of the following named
groups, and also for specimens of
all their noteworthy publications:

I. Iowa College Founders and
Trustees.

2. Contributors to its treasury
whose gifts are particularly mem~
orahle for any reason.

3. Its Faculty.

4. Its Alumni.

5. Its students
graduate here.

who did not

Give us notices of what any of
these have done or are now doing
of value in the world and for it,
Some of these have been, and
some are, engaged in enterprises
oi great importance and of his
toric interest, but their connec—
tion with our College may be for-

 

gotten unless we preserve its
memory. Daniel Webster's orig—
inal, written brief in the ”Dart-
month College Case" would be
invaluable to his Alma Mater.
Documents announcing national
honors to Elisha Gray could be
deposited wisely in Oberlin Col—
lege library, even though he did
not: complete his college course in
that institution. So we wish to
enrich our library with memo-
ran‘da of what our Austins and
I‘Iusons, our Clarks and Snells,
our Apthorps and Lymans have
been doing.

Many have written articles of
genuine and abiding value, whose
names we should aid in perpetu-
ating.

Please send us such articles.
and whether this can or can not
be done, send us their titles, nauir
ing the publication, volume, nume
her and pages where they may be
found and we will preserve the
list in a manuscript volume which
will be kept for this express pure
poo Ex—MayorSrnithpravenr
port, has sent us rich contributions
from the pen or Dr. Julius A.
Reed, Dr. Ephraim Adams has
added manuscript letters from the
founder of the Carter Professors
ship, and others have furnished
materials which increase in value
with each passing year.

Now please place this request
where it will make its mute ap-
pealto you daily until you have
complied with it completely.
where it will cause you to see
visions and to dream dreams of
Iowa College until your own his
tory shall be identical with that
of the institution by some [“67
mentoes in this Alcove.

Yours very respectfully,

L. F. PARKER.
“College Alcove” Committee.

Hand Book.

The Y. M. and Y, W. C. A. are
to be congratulated on the suc-
cess of the hand book which they
have issued this fall. It is neatly
bound in leather cover, which
gives it a much neater appearance
and makes it more lasting than
the hand book of last year. It
contains general information
about the Y. M, and Y. W. C. A.
and the other organizations of the
college. a schedule of recitations
and other matters which are of
interest and use to every student.
The book should be in the hands
of every new student. There are
a few of the hand books left which
can be obtained by any who have
