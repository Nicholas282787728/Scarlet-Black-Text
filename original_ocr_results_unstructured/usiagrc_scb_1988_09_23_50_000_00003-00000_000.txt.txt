Town plans
walk to end
hunger

Come rain or shine, many
people in the Grinnell area are
getting ready to walk for the
hungry. This year, the annual
Poweshiek County CROP Walk
will be on Sunday, October 2 at
2 pm. The 10 kilometer walk
will begin and end at St. John's
Lutheran Church, located at 1224
East Street in Grinnell.

Organizers of the event have
set a goal of attracting 250
walkers and raising $7,500 to
help hungry people, both in
Poweshiek County and in
countries around the world.
Though most of the funds raised
will be used by Church World
Service in overseas relief and de—
velopmcnt work, 25% will stay
in Poweshick County to be used
by The Second Mile. which helps
provide food, clothes, and other
basic needs of local residents.
Last year, the Poweshick County
CROP Walk raised $6,000 with
200 walkers participating.

CROP events are part of the
education and fund raising outr
reach of Church World Service,
which is the disaster relief,
development. and refugee
resettlement division of the
National Council of the Churches
of Christ in the United States.

Walkers are urged to ask
family, friends, and neighbors to
sponsor them for this event. For
more information about the walk,
contact Diane Wasson, 236-3757,
or Rev. William Schlobohm,
528-3325.

\Convocations tailored
tto joint tutorial program

‘ by Susan Roth
This fall, approximately 50
freshmen in 4 tutorial sections
, will be regularly attending the
"Culture and Power:
Misperceptions Among Nations"
Convocation Series as part of
their studies for a group tutorial
of the same name, made possible
by the Rosenﬁeld Foundation.
The syllabus of the tutorial
follows the sequence of the four
convocation lectures: America

‘ and Japan, America and the

Middle East, America and Latin
America, and Russian Attitudes
Towards the West. Each of the
four sections, taught by
professors Andrew Hsieh, Al
Jones, Katherine Simonds. and
John Mohan follows the same
course of study with slight
variations in emphasis, according
to the interest of the instructor.
John Mohan, professor of
Russian, said that the purpose of
this group tutorial "is simply to
have a fairly large number of ﬁrst

year students engaged in a com-

mon intellectual investigation." .

Professor Al Jones, also of the
Rosenfield program, echoes Mo-
han's sentiments, According to
Jones, this group tutorial also
functions as a curricular experi-
ment, "and I think we need more i
of that." Jones also predicts that l
the question of changing the cur- i
riculum in general will come up |
in the near future, and not
without debate, especially‘
concerning graduation
requirements. Jones nonetheless
asserts that "one can experiment
without totally revising the
curriculum, and this is sort of an
effort at that." As a point of fact.
the current tutorial program
evolved out of an earlier system
which gave all incoming
freshmen a set of uniform reading
assignments. A similar group
tutorial/convocation series was
also conducted in 1984 on the
topic: "George Orwell's 1984
andBeyond."
