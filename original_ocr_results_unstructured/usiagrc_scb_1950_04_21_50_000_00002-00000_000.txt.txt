Honors Back In ‘G’

The athletes of Grillnell are out to put the “honor”
back in Honor G.

Can it be done? Officers Addudle, Kingery, and Ruth-
erford think they have a few of the answers. A start in
the right direction was provided last week when their queen
candidate, Joan Hoogeveen, was chosen to reign for two
days over the Coe relays The men in the red sweaters got
to show their colors as; n when they took over the high
school boys in Grinnell for the young leaders’ conference.

These provided a Spring board for their actiVe new
ambitions. The idea is to make the organization into an

ORGANIZATION

Point number one: Regularly scheduled meetings. The
officers hope these would provide a sense of’belonging to
an organization. They can take advantage of films providv
ed by the NCAA, of which they are a member, as well as
take advantage of coaches willing to Speak who live within
distance. High school coaches coming- here might be favorr
ably impressed to recommend Grinnell to prospective
athletes.

Point number two. Sensible ini tions. These would in-
clude less time in hazing, more time devoted to “working
your nay“ into Honor G selling programs, ushering, mak-
ing selves generally useful to active members of the clum.

A formal initiation, preceded perhaps by a banduet, isi
on the docket in the year s program. All annual dance for
members is also suggested.

Point number three: Good public relations. When a
football player's parents visit campus for the first time and
Junior’s busy on the field, basketball or other Honor G men,
can escort them around campus. When Honor G alums have
little boys, and even Women’s Honor G alums, a little “G"
might be sent for a kind ol' shining star in the nursery?
_\i'ell, you get tlle idea. . . ‘

Plans for taking over the cheerleadlng organization
have already got underway. The ideas are great. They can
work if the effort is put into them. Honor G, there’s the
chance to do yourselves proud off the field as well as on.

Take it away!
