same color, they adjourned to that room.

the iaculty platiorm. and a circular racer
course occupied the ﬂoor. According to
the title on the programs, the ﬁeld meet
was, “The Flnnkers (those wearing the
green) versus the Crammers lthosc wear.

The rivalry between the two sitles was
intense, and it is sale to say that in no
held meet ever held in GrInIIell were the
evenis more hotly contested. The par
ticiparits rri each contest were vigorously
cheered and it is said that hamanrls and

other valuables were lroely wagered on

The Attitude of Iowa College in
Conferring Degrees,
Scnitrnt- AND BLACK of Feb, aoth
contained the statement that two pet's
sons or the classes cl '9: and '07, res
speciively, would receive the degree ol

Doctor of Philosophy. in June. This is
an error, as Master at Arts is the highest
degree conlerretl by the college, and
tliai is the one iorwhich the two candi-
datos mentioned are now doing graduate
work in me University or Chicago.

ln connection with this correction, the
exact attitude ol iorra College may very
properly be defined. both lor the beneﬁt
at any alumni contemplating graduate
work and lorour sisteirinstttunons and
the pubii atrial-go, who may not be
ianiilrar with the policy of the instrtri.

tion and culture, hicti the I‘cqllllcments
ola Ph. D. ricccssitato in every candidate
lor that honor. lri lact, the rdcal lot-
which the college starrtls is in part a
transplanting ol eastern high stantlards
into middle western soil. Bur ihoirgh
this is the ideal constantly in mind, the
laculty takes a most sensible view ol its
mission in the middle west and carelully

 

remains within its proper sphere. It
Iecognizes did great distinction between
the nature ol the work done by a gratin.
ate student and that done by rr Iinderr
graduate. The worlc at an undergradtv
ate, lorrristancc, is largely that ol the
class roonr, is prescribed, and is apt to
be rather cursory and orten times trrrrrred.

ho work ol a graduate, oti the other
hand, is largely induidiilil, is done only
with much thought and comparative
leisure, and cottics d ictly under the
head ol research and inuesirgaiiori. For
the tornier, the ordinary library and
laboratory lacilities are sutiicient. but tor
the latter, almost tInlImited opportunities
are none too much,

lowa College recognizes this great
distinction and knows lrrll well that she
cannot otter such opportunities. Very
rcw universities of this country can do
so satislaciorily ‘udeed, one authority
on the subject lirnrts the number to
tour—Hariard, Johns Hopkins, Colum-
bia and Chicngo~nltltoilgh many more
are actually doing so, and their number
is iast increasing. Iowa College arms to
tlo the next best thing; namely, give her
students ailiorough preparation, as tar
as her tacihties permit, then send them
on to higher institutions. This policy
has been siircessirrl. For not only do
eastern universities recognize this quality
ol thoroughness and high standard, but
graduates themselves, now doing gradu-
ate worlt, have repeatedly expressed
themselves as satistied with their col-
legiate training in Grinnell.

The above brielly points otrt the policy
and the reasons wtiy ihc adrnrt nation
is opposed to the granting oi higher de—
grecs by sriiall colleges. At present
Iowa College contois three degrees, two
iiudci-g adiintcs ot it. Is. and I’ll 13,, and
one graduate or M.1\i, but the practica.
bility ol itrc latter is tlrirrhterl and there
isastrong possibility that evcrt it will
soon be discontinued.
