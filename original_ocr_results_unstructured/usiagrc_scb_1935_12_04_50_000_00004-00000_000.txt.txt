The Scarlet and Black
Grinnell, lows.
Dear Sir:

In a world in which tolerance and patience are
all too rare virtucs, ’one hesitates a long time before
one criticizes the work of another man Grimicll
college students over a period of several years have
shown a superabundancc of both of these virtues in
their attitude toward the coaching of the Flollcer
football teams.

Now the lime has come when there can no
longer be any question about the poor quallLV of the
coaching of the football team, And whv has this
become so apparent all of a sudden? It is simply
because Grinnell has been losing games in a dis
graceful manner for three years.

Before Grillnell started on its long
streak, she had teams which were thought of as
good because they won a good share of their games
But these teams were very poor in many respects
if a careful analysis is made. I should estimate
that between 1928 and 1932, nearly one-half of the
tackles made by the Grinnell team were made above
the waist. We were taught how to tackle better
than that in high school. More than one ex-Grinnoll
football man has told me that he played for three
years on the varsity without getting so much as one
lesson in tackling or blocking. Evelythinz these men
learned about these very difficult feats, they learned
from their team-mates. Russ Ruff was as fine an
all-around back as 1 have ever seen anywhere. Ben-
ny Douglas and Hank Thomas were almost as good
All three of these men were good before they ever
set foot in Grinnell, and I dare say that what foot-
ball they lcarncd at Grinnell they learned from each
other and not from the coach, *

I went out for spring football one year. Dur-
ing the week or two of practice Coach Watt did not
teach me or any other man of the field one single
solitary thing about the fundamentals of the foot-
ball, He seemed to assume that we already knew
all about charging, blocking and tackling

It is bccause Grinncll teams are not well
grounded in fundamentals that. they have always
lacked polish. It is because thev have not been
taught how to Block, Charge and Tuck-1c, that Grin-
nell has been losing so many games in the last three
years.

Practically every game that Gl'innell has well
during the Watt regime has been won by the in-
domitable spirit of the teams. Why not back up that
spirit with some sound coaching7 Gl'innell would
soon see teams that played the game: Well. and that
solitary thing about the fundamentals of foot

Very truly yours,
John M, Thomas, '32.

Grinnell Students on Par
With Others Tuberculin Tests Show

Less Than 19 Per Cent
React When Tested;
No Real Cases

Positive reactions in [he tuber-
culin tests given in Grinncll by the
Iowa Tubel‘culosls association eat»
ly in October reveal that Grinnell's
average is practically on a par
with other colleges of the state.
but is definitely lower than the
percentages in most other states,
according to the report issued by
the tuberculosis association.

Of the students who took the
test, 18.77 per cent reacted and
were later x-rayed. Reactions,
however, vvcre considerably higher
among faculty, employees and phy-
sicians who took the test, and the
percentage for the combined
groups was 23 03 per cent reactors

Class Cage Meet
Dates Changed

To Play Annual Tourney
on Dec. 13, 14, 16

The dates for the intcrclass
basketball roundrobin tourney
have been changed from Friday
and Saturday to Dec. 13,14 and 1e,
Lester Duke, intramural director,
announced yesterday.

He urged that each class appoint
a. captain and begin organizing a
team. "In the past this has been
put off until the last moment with
the result that there has always
been a lot of confusion and disce
ganization m the tournament, If
the classes will select their teams
as early as possible, this can be
avoided."

snouid Organize Soon.

As soon as the captains are 3137
pointed Duke suggested that they
organize their team and thcn get
in touch with him if they wish to
arrange for practices.

varsity men in the past have
been lnellgible for competition in
the tourney, and probably a. like
rule will be in force this year,
Duke stated yesterday, “However,
no definite ruling has been made
as yet.”

Tourney Pairings.

Pal rigs for the tournament are
as follows: Dec. mifmshmen vs,
juniors; sophomores vs_ seniors.
Dec, 14—frcshmen vs. seniors;
sophomores vs. juniors. Dec. 16—
freshmen vs. sophomores; juniors
vs. seniors.

Last year the tourney was won
by the present sophomores. Their
team, however, will be hampered
by the loss of Hayward. Dean,
Trautwein, Evans and Riley. who
am now all out for varsity basket—
ball. The tournament should be a
wide open affair, Duke believes.

people in Grinncll and 605 showed

vealed that three students show re;

ccrdihg to the report.

Average Results

“The percentage of positive re-
actors in this survey was about
the average for lows colleges, but
was much lower than prevails in
most other states, for it is a well—
known face that the incidence of
tuberculosis infection closely paral-
lels the mortality rate. Those who
have a flair for the study of vital
statistics have been proud of the
fact that the tuberculosis death
rate is so low in our state," the
report states in summarizing the
results of the survey here.

“Tile health of the college Stu»
dents should be considerably
above the average for the commu-
nities. This’situation was notice-
ably present in Grinnell college,
as determined by the results of
our investigation.

“Those who reacted positively
to the Mantoux test. without dem-
onstrable active disease by physi-
cal examination and x»ray, were
advised to observe proper hygien-
ic care and further damage should
be averted," the summary contin-
ucs.
