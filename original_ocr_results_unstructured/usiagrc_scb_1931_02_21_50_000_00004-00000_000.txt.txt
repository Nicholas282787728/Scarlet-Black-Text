Lose, 59-24

(Special to The S irlei and Block)

DES MOINE57Coach A. Y. “Scab
ty" Russell's Drake university swiin-
ming team gave definite proof of the
validity of its claims to superiority in
the Missouri Valley conference here
yesterday afternoon, when it downed
the Grinnell college mermen, 59 to
24.

The Bulldog swimmers have de-
feated the Oklahoma Aggies and
Washington university, while the Pio-
neers have already won over Creigh-
ton. ‘

strong Features Meet

Miller turned in the only first
for the scarlet and black team when
he coasted home to an easy win in
the 44ﬂryl-1rd event. Shaw of Drake
barely nosed out Adams of Grinnell
in the 60-yard free style.

Maurice “Bus" Strong, Drake's Elle
American diver, piled up 121 points
to take first place in that event. His

exhibition was the feature of the ‘

meet.

After slowly pulling up on the
Drake baaketeers, McKee decided the
contest for Grinnell by sinking a
long shot less than a minute before
the game ended.

The defense, which has been the best
part of the little Ploneers' court work,
showed up in the last half, when the

well chosen. and although makeup in
a few cases was obvious, the hack-

smooth and adequate.

A brief pleasure came in the offs
stage music of Margaret Skelton and
lsabella Dedinszky, Miss Dedinszky
played her own composition.

Constant Attention

The coordination of lines and ac-
tion was surprisingly effected, and
if the ﬁrst of an act bore the weight
of its exposition, the swift light
touches of the rising action compen»
sated.

Scarcely a laugh failed to echo in
the audience. There was a constant
attention and a real amused satisfac-
tion that was a tribute not only to
the comedy-situation itself, but as
well to the “alarming amount" of his
dependent direction by Virginia Read,
Alice Jewell, and Margaret Wood,

tions of the training of Mrs. Sara

MO-pound Chicago veteran who was
quarterback on the Golden Avalanche
football team last fall. Due to an
injury, McElliott was under a
handicap in early games, but now has
rounded into form and stands well
up in the Marquette scoring. He un-
leashed three dazzling baskets in a
row to pull the last Lawrence game
out of the fire for the Blue and Gold.

Marquette Center Sets
Mark Against Grinnell

(Special to The Scarlet and Black)
MILWAUKEE—Walter “Whitey"
Budrunas, Marquette university's
lanky basketball center, is believed
l to have set a record of some sort
against Crinnell college here re-
cently, when he scored four ﬁeld
goals and one free throw, nine
points, in 55 consecutive seconds
of play.
Waukegan, Ill. The tow-headed long-
hoy has been high-scorer in almost
every game this season, and is out in
front in scoring with 125 points on
43 field goals and 29 free throws in
14 games, or an average of about 9
points a game.
King Dangerous on Offense

 

because of the death of his father.

Coach Chandler, the old Wisconsin

all-western, has been getting excelr
lent guard play this season, and has
a splendid backrcourt combination in
Capt. “Joe King, Chicago, Ill, and Al
Shipley. Kenosha. WiS., both veter-
ans.

King, left guard on the football
team for the last three seasons, is a'
master in controlling the ball. and is
ably seconded by the aggressive
Shipley. Both are dangerous on of-
fense, and have scored 93 points be-
tween them this season.

Ronzani All-A eund Athlete

Recent ineligibll es took Such men
as McQueen, Mundt, and Bl'edow
from the Marquette squad, but
Chandler has reliable reserves in
Eugene "Tuffy" Ronzani, Iron Moun-
tain, Mich., guard; Tommy Savage,
Kenosba, Wis, guard, and Mario
,Fiorani, Iron Mountain, Mich, center.

Ronzanl, who weighs 190 pounds
and was a backfield ace in the 1930
football campaign, has played every
position on the team this season, and
is one of the most promising all-
around athletes Marquette has seen
in recent years.
