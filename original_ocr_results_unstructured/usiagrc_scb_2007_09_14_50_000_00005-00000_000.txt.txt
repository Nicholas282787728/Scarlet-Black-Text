The evolution of

The French Connection
"— (1971)/Hat Fuzz (2007)

TIM Fretlr/J Cmmez/iml, the 1971 Best Fit
turc oscar winner, is widely considered the
quintesscntial action movie. H122 Fuzz lovingly
emulates all the movies that have followed TIM
Fran/J Cmmediml, but with tonguc firmly in
cheek—its purpose both to pay homage and
critique the genres style.

William Fliedkin's T12: ["rmc/I Connection
follows the story of two cops on assignment
to track down a French shipment of drugs.
The plot is based on an actual case; the two
policemen originally involved even assisted
productton. The movie possesses an ullscts
tlingly realistic documcntal‘y‘like atmosphere
that doesn’t interfere with its tluiclt patents
numerous chase scenes are always suspeuscrul
and involving; pursuing a suspect through the
streets ofNew York requires as much attention
from the audience as it does from the police-
men on screen. Gene Hackman, who won an
Oscar for his performance, breathes life into
tlle reprehensible, contemptuous and piteous
character of Jimmy “Popeye" Doyle, the origi—
nal “so bad he's actually good" cop. His ques-
tionable behavior adds further authenticity to
the movie, yet doesnt lessen our sympathy for
him.

The two ﬁlms make interest-
ing companion pieces: a gritty,
persona/ action movie, and a
caricature ofthe genre today

The comedy Hot Fuzz, written by and stars
ring Simon Pegg, parodies the most famous
action movies of the past few years that have
followed in The French Comtztziarz’s impressive
footsteps. Filled with intentional cliches, it tells
the story of the ostensibly perfect cop Nichor
las Angel (Pegg), transferred from London to
the “just too quiet" city of Sandford.The best
comedy derives from intense and professional
Angel being thrust into work where the most
pressing matter for the police is a stray goose.
But ironically, the clichés and comedy hinder
the movie when its plot becomes more seri—
ous.
The two films make for interesting come
panion pieces: the ﬁrst a gritty and personal
look at an intricate drug hust, the second a car-

icature ofclichés exposing the superficialiry of

most contemporary action movies. The Franz};

Foster‘s performance, though, is somewhat of
a letdown considering the high standards she
usually sets.

But numerous ﬂaws spoil Mamiet. The
weak and linear plot is too predictable during
its ﬁrst half. And some of the characters, such
as Alfred Molina's Angel, require hirthcr den
vclopment and explanation.

Technically, the movie succeeds. Superb set
pieces and fasterato cinematography capture
the beauty of the Wild West through excellent
outdoor locales and camerawork.

Maastirt is a fun way to spend a couple
