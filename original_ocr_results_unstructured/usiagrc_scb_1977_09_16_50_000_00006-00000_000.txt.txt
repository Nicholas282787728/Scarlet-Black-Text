 

Appearing this weekend

Farrell, Martins among best

A troupe of ii dancers from the
New York City Ballet and other
renowned companies will stage
two exclusive perlormances
sponsored by the Iowa ,Arts
Council. The curtain goes up at
8:30 plml tomorrow and 5:00 pm.
Sunday. The following are short
biographies ol the principal
dancers. Suzanne Farrell and
Peter Martins.

As an especially favored protege
of choreographer George Balan-
chine, Suzanne Farrell ascended to
her present eminence as a dancer.
Farrell joined the New York City
Ballet when she was 15 years of age
and received her first solo role at
is. At 19, she was promoted to the
rank at principal dancer. or the
approximately 40 ballets in the
company’s season, Farrell has
been the leading dancer in more
than 20. Balanchine has continued
to create new works for her.

In 1970, she left Balanchine and
the New York City Ballet. She
spent the next live years in
Europe with Maurice Eejart and
his Ballet of the 20th Century.
Bejart’s technical foundation, with
its modern and eastern inﬂuences,
has little in common with Balan-
chine’s. Thus, the Farrell who has
rejoined the Balanchine fold is
Somewhat different from the one

 

who left

NEVERTHELESS, critics
generally feel that while her
European experience has matured
her as a dancer, Farrell’s style has
unquestionably been molded by the
Balanchine repertory in which she
has ﬁgured so crucially. Over two-
thirds of the more than 50 ballets
she has danced have been by
Balanchine. He has created ten
roles designed for her. and revived
three others for her benefit.

Farrell's expressive versatility
has spurred Balanchine to create a
widely divergent idiom lor her.
She, in turn, has responded by
conquering the whole range. It has
been said that there are as many
Farrells as there are Balanchines.
“The New Yorker’s" 'Arlene Croce
has hailed her as “one of the great
dancers ol the age,” a judgement
shared by many other critics.

PETER Martins has been with
the New York City Ballet Since
1970, Before that, he danced in his
native Copenhagen, first as a
student, then as a principal with
the Royal Danish Balletr

He entered the Royal Danish
Ballet School at age eight. There he
studied with Volkva, Hans Brenna
and Stanley Williams. Joining the
company at 18, he was elevated to
principal at 21. The next year,

 

following two years as a guest
artist, Martins joined the New
York City Ballet as a principal.

Choreographer Balanchine has
also been the major inﬂuence in
Martins’ development as an artist,
although his repetoire with the
company now includes most of the
Jerome Robbins ballets along with
those of Balanchine.

MARTINS has appeared as a
guest artist with most of the
regional ballets companies in

America and with the National -

Ballet of Canada. London's
Festival Ballet, The Grandtheatre

of Geneva, and often With his .

former home company, the Royal
Danish Ballet. He most recently
appeared on television in a series
of Balanchine works filmed in
Berlin. He also has taught classes
at the School of American Ballet,
master classes for many regional
companies and company classes
for the New York City Ballet.

Martins is often partnered with
Farrell and the pair dance ex-
tremely well together. “I trust him
completely, ” Farrell said recently
“Even if something should go
wrong, i know he’ll catch me,” She
added, ‘We both like to dance the
same way, to take a few chances at
each performance and we like Mrr
Balanchine a lot.”

Weekend features triple film showing

By Nancy Carpenter
and Michael Greenfield

ln Walkabout, a middleaged
Australian businessman drives his
lieyearbld daughter and 6-year-
old Son out into the desert, ape
parently for a picnic. Once uiere he
tries but fails to shoot them before
committing suicide. Director
Nicholas Rceg takes his audience
along with the children on a
wandering tour of the Australian
outback, The children’s civilized
frames of reference are our own
and we share their discoveries.

Alter linding and depleting a
waterhole and some berries, the
children meet an Aboriginal boy
who is on his walkaboutian ex»
tended manhood trial involving
months of single-handed survivial
in the outback. He takes them
under his protection until their
alliance inevitably leads to
tragedy, I say “inevitably”
because Race is pairing two
mutually exclusive cultures—the
Europeanized, metropolitan
Australian and the Aboriginal.
Civilization automatically
dismisses the Aborigines as back-
wards, while the inflexible
Aboriginal moral codes demand
equally harsh judgement of the
civilized. Roeg makes it clear to
the viewer which culture be ad-
mires more.

TAKING A camera into the
outback must have been this
cameraman - turned-director's
dream. Walkabout is visually
stunning, as are Roeg’s other
directoral efforts: Performance,
Don't Look Now, and The Man Who
Fell to Earth AS one critic put it,
this is probably the best movie
about Australia you will ever see.
Walkabout was released in 1971
and is 95 minutes long.

The speed and sparkle ol Preston
Sturges' movies cause Sullivan's
Travels to be as funny today as it
was in 1942. Sturges combined
comedy and social Satire wiﬂl his
Hollywood studio’s matchless
stable of character actors to
produce this movie.

A fllm director (Joel McCrea)
wants to make a film that is
“socially relevant,” so he goes out
into the world with a dime in his
pocket to discover what it’s all
aboutibeing poor and homeless
and on the run, The love interest is
Veronica Lake wearing her famous
peekaboc style haircut.

Sturges’ managed to slip in lots

of personal humor that he and his
colleagues would enjoy. For
example. Joel McCrea announces
his biggest ambition as a director
is to be “just like Frank Capra," a
director whose sensibilities were
very remote lrom Sturges’.
Another example of Sturges’
humor would be the twist ending of
the film. which I refuse to give
away.

KNUTE ROCKNE. All-
Anierican is being shown to
coincide with the season opener of
the Grinnell College football team.
The film is a 1940 biography on the
life of Knute Rockne, Notre
Dame’s famous football coach.
Not simply a biography. this film
goes beyond recounting the
events of Rockne's life. instead. it
takes a broad view of the game of
football itself, seeing it as a
metaphor for the battling frontier
spirit that has long been associated
with America,

Rockne, who graduated from
Ncire Dame in 1914 with a B.S. in
chemistry, is regarded as the
person who most greatly in-
ﬂuenced college football. He was
appointed to a coaching position
while he was serving on the staff of

the chemistry department and was
named head football coach in 1913.

ROCKNE brought the technique
of forward passing to perfection.
l-le demanded perlect coor-
dination with all members of the
starting eleven functionlng like
parts of a machine. Nonetheless,
his first rule of football called for
good sportsmanship. It was this
principle which earned him the
respect and admiration of football
players and fans nationwide.

The film’s most memorable
performance is from Fat O’Brien,

who stars in the title role. Ronald
Reaganstars as George Gipp, the
ill-fated star of the team. Reagan,
you may remember, continued his
film career as the governor ol
California. The qualityoi' Reagan’s
performance for most of the 84
minutes of the movie probably
exceeds that of any of his 84 or so
months as governor of California.
Reagan wasa pretty good actor,
which is more than I can say . . .
forget it, it would not have beeen
very nice anyway
