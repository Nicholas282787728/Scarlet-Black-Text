East 11163: rimming in YearsiEimry-

a] Gi-lhhcli Enlllltsmsm.

Friday'wns the occasion of one or
the most unusual demonstrations that
has ever occurred in the history of
Grinnell College. A carefully planned
program was arranged which resulted
in one of the ,most complete expres.
sions of enthusiasm that has hcon seen
here in many a day. At the close of
the chapel service a line of men stood
with locked arms and as the crowd
came out forccd them to loliow the
hand winch marched down town, where
they listened to snccchcs from a num-
her of the townspeople nnd Representa
tive Kendall who was in the crowd
After this the crowd wcut hack to the
campus where members of the faculty
were captured after more or less in.
glorious attempts to escape, and given
an opportunity to commend the sLu~
dent body for the enthusiasm that was
shown. After a short out successiul
program of faculty felicitations those
who would go to Cornell were given an
opportunity to sign up. About 200
names were secured and the word was
passed for the evening mass meeting
where the day‘s events would come to
a triumphant close.

The mass meeting last evening was
without question the hest that has ever
been held in Grinnell in the last ilve
years. A big crowd, music by the hand.
a good program of short, snappy, hut
appropriate speeches from Coach
Dougherty and Trainer Fisher, the
rnemhers of the team who were there,
all came to a climax in Turner's speech
where he told of what the college would
do for the team in tomorrow's game.
After another call from Chairman
Holmes for those who would o Cor.
neil, the meeting adjourned, l inging a
close to a most unusual day in crin-
ncil histoi .
