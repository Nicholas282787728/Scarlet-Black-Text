Qﬁbltorial

in considering the general value of
a book published by one 01 our faculty
‘rre naturally reel more interested in it
than irit werethe work ol;an outsidec
rue reason ror this appears to us
to he that one considers the book not
only a product of the man himself but
in a way a product of the college.
Students are surely not the only ones
who have a close aillliatlon with the
ideals of the institution The men
who help make those ideals are also
inﬂuenced by them. Such illllueuce
must come out to some extent lll tile
things that they produce and so in a
measure the college itself is respon-
sible for whatever value the workmay
have To the outside world they are
the same as books published by other
men, but to the college they are a
part or itself.

poltance or our association, there are
other ties which bind itto the college:
