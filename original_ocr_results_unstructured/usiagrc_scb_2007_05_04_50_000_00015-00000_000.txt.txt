“This season we went in having a lot of ex-

runs scored.

While the split against Simpson gave the
Pioneers some momentum and conﬁdence
coming into a mustswin weekend with four
conference games, the split
against IC kept Grinnell
from being marhematrcally
eliminated from postsear
son play.

Grinnell dropped the
ﬁrst game of the series, 7—4,
and saw leave the game af-
ter 5 and 2/3 innings with

loaded double by Unsell. But another Pioneer
went down to injury when Mendoza injured a
ﬁnger sliding into third base and had to leave
the game. Senior Bow Brannon evened out his
record to 3-3 by pitching 7 1/3 innings and
giving up just three runs to “the best team rn
the conference," Brannon s‘aid.

Leaving men on base has been a prob-
lem for the Pioneers during a 2.5 rnidscason
slump, but Coach Tim Hollibaugh sccs that
rrend changing.

“We are playing better team baseball, rec-
ognizing situations and taking advantage," he
said. “That means fewer mcn left on base."

Despite the slump, several players still have
their sights set on returning to the conference
tournament for thc second straight year and
the second time in school history.

“I think it is enrirely possible to win four
games this weekend," said Clark. “That would

keep us mathematically in it, bur I don‘t care
about math. Ijust want to end the season on a
high note,whcther it is this weekend or next."
Even if the Pioneers win out against Mon-
mouth and Knox, they may miss the playoff
cut. Grinnell’s playoff hopes depend on how
Illinois College and Knox ﬁnish the season.
“We are facing a lot of adversity with rhe
injuries,but the strengrh ofrhis team has been
its deptlr,"Hollibaugh said. “We have had guys
like Clayton Chamberlain ['08] and James
Bird [’07] step up. we have a chance ro see
what this team is made ofthis weekend."
Grinnell (12716, 276 MWC) starts off the
weekend at noon tomorrow with a double-
header at Monmouth (13714, 7—3 MWC).The
Pioneers return home to host Knox on Sunday
in a doubleheader set to begin at 1 pm. St,
nior-s will be honored in between games during

the Knox doubleheader.
