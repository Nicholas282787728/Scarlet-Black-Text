Can women’s war poetry reconcile two worlds?

Vince Gotera’s Scholar’s Convocation lecture addresses issues, progress

By LESLIE MADSEN
Arts Editor

Vince Gotera, a professor at the
University of Northern Iowa and a
Minority Scholar-In-Residence at
Grinnell, gave yesterday's Scholar's
Convocation lecture, “Reconciliation
and Women's Poetry of the Vietnam
War."

The convocation was jolntly spon»
sored by the English department, the
Sesquicentennial Committee, and the
Minority ScholarseineResidence Pro-
gram.

Professor George Barlow intro
duced Professor Gotera as “one of a
handful of people in the country we
can call ethnic literature generalist: "
Mr, Gotera's specialties include
Asian-American literature, popular
culture studies, and Vietnam War
studies. His talk represented a
conﬂuence ofthese interests.

Mr, Gotera began his presentation
by recognizing the residual effects of
the Vietnam War in American rela»
tions with Asia. He noted a cone
spicuous absence of women in the
discussions, representations, and
writing about the War, Their exclu»
sion might lead one to believe there
were no women in Vietnam, Mr.
Gotera remarked.

He said that anthologies of Vlclr
nam War poetry in the 1970's and

early 1980’s tended to contain only
a handful of poems by women and
very few by Vietnamese poets.

He centered his lecture around
two more recently published collec-
tions ofpoetry: Shallow Gluvcx: Two
Women and Vietnam, by Wendy
Wilder Larsen and Tran Thi Nga, and
Vld‘lmlx of War, Dreams of Peace:
Wlittltgd‘ of Women in the Vietnam
War, which was edited by Lynda Van
Devanter and loan A. Furey,

Mr. Goterzi claimed that these two
anthologies of women's poetry have
made for
larger gese
turcs to
ward the
reconcilia»
tion of the
American
and Vietnamese worlds than did their
predecessors.

But the anthologies have been
criticized. Mr. Goterii related that
one revtewer went so far as to sug
gest that some ofthe poetry in Shale
low Gtaves would be more success»
ful ifit had been published as prose.
Ms. Larsen, Mr. Gotera explained,
taped Mrs. Nga telling her Stories,
then made the tales into verse

Mr, Gotera highlighted the fact
that Ms, Larsen's role Its a “buffer"
might be problematic because any.
one in such a situation might not have
been a completely accurate transla-

poet. ” illinee Gotem.

tor. He underscored Ms Larsen’s per
tonne] failure, as an American, to
grasp Vietnamese culture in all its
complexity As an example, he men-
lioncd that she might not fully unr
dcrstand the importance ofrice in the
”Vlelnaniesc cultural universe."

M . Gotcra used tWO pocms, each
titled “The Noodle Cart." as a prime
example ofAmericztns' tendency to
miunderstand the Vietnamese expe-
rience. in the ﬁrst poem, Ms. Larsen
relates the tale of how sheenlisted Mrs,
Nga to procure a noodle cm for her

Ms. Nga's tale of the purchase of

however. In her poem, Mrs, Nga ree
lates what Mr. Gotera termed the
”terrible odyssey" ofthe purchase or
the noodle cart: the weeks spent
searehing for a cart for sale, the
people she met during her quest, the
heartbreak the sale caused one fam-
ily,

When the purchase was finally
made, Mrs, Nga shares, Ms. Larsen

to the United States.

However, despite such differences
in View, Mr, Goterzt said, both Ms.
Larsen and Mrs. Nga “represent in
microcosm the... mourners of their
nations."

Mr. Gotera applauded the inclu-

Visions of Wm; Dreams of Peace
is also interesting, Mr. Gotera
noted. because it contains poems
by women who were nurses in
Vietnam. Thus, several of the po-
ems address issues of death and
suffering. But, he explained,Viet-
namese poets also discuss these
topics—although, Mr, Gotera said.
the Vietnamese may be more likely
to extendtheirmourningtoinclude
the enemy as well.

The poems in these anthologies.
Mr. Gotera explained, approach

. the quandary orbeing both women

and veterans. Such an identity has
not been traditionally recognized.

But whether the poets were
American or Vietnamese. Mr.
Gotera emphasized that their com-
mon experiences represent “a hat-
binger of the possibility of recon-
ciliation" and thus may be the pi]-
tngs on which might be built
bridges between the two worlds.

During the question and answer
session following his presentation,
Mr. Gotera stressed that poetry is
far more important to the Vietname
ese than it is to Americans. “Ev-
eryone in Vietnam is a poet,“ he
said, and explained that it was not
unusual to find poems tucked into
the personal effects of the casual-
ties of war.
