Faculty administration schisms grow

Ceasetand-desist letter issued to Savarese, faculty mobilizes amidst claims of improper faculty contact with students

uvARi ANISFELD, PAT CALDWELL 8c DAVID LOGAN

As the Trustecs gathered on campus yesterday for their
quarterly meeting, they arrived at a college with a deep divide
between its faculty and administrators.

A series oftecent events beginning with bnrbcd letters and
legal threats have galvanized the College’s faculty and left both
professors and administrators questioning the faculty’s role in
relation to the Ofﬁce of Strident Affairs. At the same time,
questions have been raised over whether faculty have inupt
propriately contacted and pressured students for information
pertaining to personnel issuesThrs all comes on the heels of
last semester‘s controversial faculty lettcr to the 5&3 IldL‘YeSS’
ing the departure of former Associate Dean and Director of
Residence Life Sheree Andrews and a fiery open forum which
featured public sparring hetween administrators and faculty

On Monday. Jan 26, Ralph Savatesc, English, was sent a
ccascmndtdesist letter from College President Russell K. Os-
good, according to numerous faculty sources. When reached
by the sort, savarcsc would not offer any comment.

Osgood would ncithcr confirm nor deny the existence ot
a ccasc-and-dcsist lctrct, citing the confidentiality of private
conversations with professors, but did state that, “Professor
Savarcse is a faculty member in good standing, [and is] not
the subicct ofany disciplinary action."

Many faculty members, however, said they viewed the
ceasctand-desist letter as an unwarranted and intimidating
gesture. "That’s something really upsetting, to move to n powt
ct move so quickly," said Johanna Meehan, Philosophy. when
asked about the letter. “It really shirts off and silences people
in a way that does not seem a good thing."

While the exact motivation for sending the letter remained
vague to many faculty members rntervrewed, the faculty rct
sponse was quite strong. “I don’t know what Professor Savat

rcsc said, but I think it's hard to understand the prcsidcnt's
response as anything other than an attempt to intimidarc a
faculty rncrnhcr into kccping quiet and I'm not sure when that
would be appropriate," said a tcnured professor who was not
initially involved in the discussions over Andrews'depaiture,
and who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive
nature ofthe topic “My intuition is that it would never be ap—
propriate, given tree speech."

In response to the ccrrsetandtdcsrst letter and ongoing
grrevances against the administration, certain faculty mcmt
bers, including many who signed the initial letter to the war,
organized and decrded to present their concerns to the broader
faculty community at a regularly scheduled ailtfaculry meeting
this past Monday.

At the meeting, Victoria Brown, History, who signed on
to the 5553 letter, read a statement on behalf of the involved
faculty which outlined their concerns on the Student Affairs
hiring and firing process and called for a faculty-only ad hoc
meeting later in the week dedicated to the issue.

At the subsequent meeting, which was held Wednesday
and attended by roughly 60 faculty members, a select group
of professors presented to the rest ofthe faculty in attendance
a pnckct of information detailing Andrews’ dismissal and the
professotsl correspondence with Osgood. The materials also
included specific concerns about the College's Vice President
of Student Affarrs Houston Dougharty, who became a central
target tor faculty no in the wake ofAndrews’ departure.

After some (liscusston, the faculty present at Wednesday's
meeting took a vote on three separate issues: whether there
should be an external rcvicw ofAndrows' departure, whether
the scorch for Andreivs’ replacement should be placed on hold
until an investigation can be completed, and whcthcr Andrcws
should be rehircd.The ﬁrst two measures passed by wrdc mar»

middle

“The overwhelming majority felt that there was reason for
concern and that it was reasonable to ask for the president to
set up a tcviewwhcn so many people had so much confirmed,"
Mechan said.

Faculty members have arranged a meeting with the col-
lege’s Board ofTrusrees today in order to present their com
plaints outside ofthe college‘s formal channels.

Srnce the December open forum, certain faculty members
continued to investigate the circumstances ofAndrews’s det
parture, On Jan 27, before Savaresc received the CBﬂSC’Rﬁd’
desist via mail, a group of professors presented Osgood with
a letter seeking the creation of an external rcvrew of Student
Affairs and its hiring and firing practices,

Osgood responded two days later with a letter ofhis own (a
copy ofwhith was obtained by the stair), stating that faculty
were fully separate from the office of studcnr Affairs. His let-
rcr also addressed claims faculty members had made through
what he characterized as “unauthorized investigations,"

“1 note that no evidence was actually adduced with the
statement," Osgood wrote, “and recall the torrent of etmails
from a faculty author with various claims, many anonymous
and also frequently omitting key facts and events even rf
known to the faculty author, and a number wrth demeanrng
and insulting alarms."

Students approached by faculty

While the student body has remained largely unaware of
these recent events. the effects of the dispute have begun to
trickle down to students SGA Vice President for Academic
Affairs Julie Hoyt: '09 noted the difficult position that sm-

Alcohol Task Force
formed for review

BYBRIAN SHERWIN

In alan 29 email, President Russell K.
Osgood announced the formation ota Task
Force on Alcohol Policies and Issues that
will produce a report evaluating college
policies related to alcohol and suggesting
ways to improve themThc hody’s members,
roughly half orwhom are students, is merely
an exploratory organ and will not issue any
policy changes.

While the Task Force will conduct a
comprehensive and communitytlaased ext
amination ofthe drug and alcohol policies, it
will not be charged with rmplementing any
changes to them, according to Vice President
for Student Affairs and axiofﬁcio Task Force
Member Houston Dougharry.

Dougharty said the Task Force would
likely not recommend a complete overhaul of
the current policies.“l sec no reason to throw
the baby out with the bath water ifwe've got
an environment that works and that people
can be responsible with,” Dougharty said.
Instead most of the Task Force’s recomment
dations will likely be adjustments to existing
policy

Members said that they do not have hard
plans, but expect their work will emphasize
community education about thc responsible
use ofalcohol. “Every Monday morning,

I know ofpcople who get themselves in a
pickle legally or they get themselves in a
prclsle in terms of their health," Dougharty
sard, “I think that we have a responsibility to
provide those folks with education, so that
they don't make those choices."
