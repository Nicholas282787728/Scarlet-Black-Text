megabucks for all.

$350 is a good deal of money to be when out of student
funds for any political activity. If this is what the Joint
Board wants, this is what they get. But let them
remember that every organization, every small gather-
ing of activists, in fact anyone who can argue that their
opinions are worthy of being read, can now receive SGA
megabucks to publish a journal. No, there is nothing
wrong with a variety of student publications, in fact this

is a great idea.

In allocating these funds, however, the Joint Baord
may have been severely short-sighted. They have failed
to see that other groups must also be accommodated, and
how this can be done fairly is questionable. We do not
have unlimited funds. Good luck, Outcry, and welcome!

» Good luck Joint Board, and good luck ye special interest

publishers of the future.

One last note: It‘s a bit ironic that those favoring alle
campus referendums last year are anxiously opposed to
one on this issue. Oh well, so much for democracy.

Seneca Peace Encampment

by Karry Koon

“if the peace movement is to
make non-violent revolutionsi It
must commit itself to overthron»
ing Patriarchy,” 7 Donna War-
neck

i spent two months this summer
at the Women‘s Encampment tor
a Future oi Peace and Justice in
Seneca County. New York.
Located on iarmland that once
belonged to native Americans. the
Encampment is located directly
beside the Seneca Army Depot. a
major storage site and trans»
shipment point tor the Cruise and
Pershing ll missiles.

In solidarity with the women at
Greenham and other release
camps throughout the world, we
chose directy non-violent coniron»
talion to protest these nuclear
weapons, We divided our time this
summer between education and
civil disobedience. Since the En-
campment has no leaders and no
spokeswomen. each woman who
experienced the Encampment can
speak only tor hersell. Herc. lam
describing what the Encampment
is lrom my own perspective

As an educational center. the
Encampment will eventually ass
quire a large libra’r power con
lerences. and organize protests.
Work on lhese long term goals
goes on all year long. Educating
the nearby communities about the
weapons is a priority as well, Over
the past summer. each weekend a
different topic was the object oi
discussion. We had frequent
speakers and lilms, in an eiiort to
make connections between issues.
For example, expressions oi
patriarchal violence include not
only the build-up oi nuclear
weapons. but also rape and the
destruction of the environment
Our society must stop rewarding
masculine aggressiveness. and
stop thinking in terms oi “us and
“them". it the human species is to
survive. Education not only
means being aware oi the eliect oi
a onemegaton bomb dropped on
Manhattan. it also means
recognising the roots oi the pro
blem and trying to stop the
violence lhat permeates our socie-
ty The nuclear bombs are only a
symptom
