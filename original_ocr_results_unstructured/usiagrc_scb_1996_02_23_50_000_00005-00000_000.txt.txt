Brain Rotting?
Play Video games.

Video games are anti—social and
rot your mind, People have said rhis
before and it may be true, but at
Grinnell WdED games have become
an enjoyable social activity and a
release for many students after hours
ofhomework. Avid video game play—
er DanWislockt. ’98, compared play—
ing Video games with watching foot—
ball; “It's the same as if we all went
down to watch football together we
Cept it [playing games] is more inrere
active."

Many students said they did not
play as many Video games until they
came to Grinnell because there isn’t
as much to do here. On Younket
third, sporrs Video games have be—
come a major social activity. In one
room, NBA ’96 brings seven people
together to play against each other
on a regular basis. Down the hall in
Younker, acomputetfoolball league
developed where players have two
games each week. Player Jeremy
wurmrielrl said the league srarted
because “we werejust a bunch of guys
who liked hanging out and playing
football,”

While many students enjoy the
socialatmosphereotgames,rheyean
also be veryintense. As Lucas Foster,
‘98, said when he was asked to be
interviewed during a game ofFA—18
Hornet, “Shut up, I'm trying to ﬂy!,
“the games bring out aviolent mood,
After the game had finished, Foster
added that one of the reasons he
liked to playwas because “I like blow—
ing things up," Violent games pro«

Vide a release from homework to many
students. Three—Dimensional multi-
player games Hexen and Marathon
were favorites. Luke Beschta and
friends in Langan have networked
their Macintoshes so they can play
Marathon against each other.

Playingoncampuscomputershas
become increasingly popular ‘in the
past year as great games such as Doom
and Civilization have become avail—
able forMacintoshes. Ananonymous
student said that there were always
copies of games on the common serv»
ers. Although it is currently against
school policy ro have video games on
campus, the Student and Academic
ComputingCommltteesrecommendr
ed last year that freeware games be
allowed. In MathLAN computers can
be used {or treeware video games if
they are not needed (or academic pur«
poses. Many students play X«Pilot, a
multiplayer gravity game, “It's fun to
yell and scream at each other," said
Wislocki, Rob Reasoner, ’96, added
that XePilotis “A nice release." After
working hard for two hours; it's nice
to blow something up."

Although video games can be a
social actiVity there are also many
solitary ritleo gamers on campus, “I
think it takes a special kind at per.
son," said Margaret Meoough, ’98,
Games like Civilrzation and Doom
are time consuming and have caused
occasional problems in the labs as
players don‘t want to leave their games
so others can write papers.

Whatever the case may be. Video
games are now spread rampid on this
college campus The question now is:
“When will you become an addict?”

I’ve never considered myself a
big fan of pove However, as a
college student ~ particularly as a
Grinnell student— poverty has not
been easy to avoid, ,For the past
three weeks, I’ve been (tying to sup

$13.70, and I haven’t been altoT
gethetsuccessful. It’s times likethese
that make students wringtheirhands
in despair, asking “where are paid
psychology experiments when you
need them?” Although Grinnell
prides itself on being able to offer

students still live on a budget of less

constraints often make people re—
markable resourceful; for college
students, creativity is not necessar—
ily an inherent trait, but one fos»
tered by our lack of money,

Of course, this creativrty is not
always appreciated. Recently, after

go another week without washing
my clothes, 1 ransacked my room,
car and roommate in order to come
up with the funds to buy laundry
chips. Later, as 1 went to pay for my
purchase, lcotefullypulledout three
