(Ed. note a In an effort toanswer
the oft repeated questions "Is
Grinnell fast becoming the party
school of the midwest7" and “Is
beer drinking becomingthenum-
ber one campus passiime?" we
assigned Washington Bureau Cir
icf Jim Skarzy'nski and Scarlet
and Black staff writer Sherman
Boone to investigate the situation

.om two different perspectives.

Their reports appear here.)

i a r
There's really not much one

can say about beer drinking
in Grinnell: eitheryou've "ex-
perienced" or you haven't.
There are five places with
in walking distance that cater
to the beer enthusiast: the

Longhorn, Russ', Duffy’s,
J. D.'s and Lhe Pub.

Recently, I experienced this
entire line-up of esiablisha
ments for the sake of saying
that ! accomplished a here
[0' fore a unattempted feat.
Yes, that's right folks, ihad
never made the town scene
until n0\V...i

The Longhorn, well it's si-
mply what I expected it to
be, the “Horn." With an at-
mosphere of early American
truck top, the Horn appears
to be lacking something. What
t is i rally cannot say, but

' the Horn struck me as being

something out of “Amerimn
Graffitti"; a place to grab a
quick burger and teasea wait-
ress or two. Not much else.
Russ' and Diffy's canbe tak-
en together-and left alone. l
mean they're fine ifyou're into
the American work ethic, yet
somehow their atmosphere
didn‘t impress me as being

.Ivy League. As a matter of

fact, the only thing that struck
me was the “looks" I got
when walking through the door.
Strictly these are not the pla»
ces for those who favor ela-
borate cu'sine, yet Duffy's is
a “treat" if you dig pinball
and pool and an early Ameri-
can gas station atmosphere.
J.D.’s is a trip in itself.
It is the perfect place to quaff
a round or two of Heinekens

.and listen to the ramblings

of proprietor Bob Globus. it's
worth the extra money just to

hear this guy; being a cross
between Art Buckwald andAl-
an Sherman, he will dominate
any conversation you even thi-
nk ofstarting.Theatmosphere
of J.D.’s is quiet and relax-
ing- -there are no bright lights
or bouncing pinballs. Overall,
J.D.'s is theplace togoin town
if you're looking foran escape
from the surreality ofGrinnell

College. It's the type of place
that one goes to fora “quick
one' andstaysallnight._l.D.'s
definitely has a “Four'Mug”
rating!

The Pub Club is alsothetype
of place where one goes to
and usually stays all night;
there must be somethingin the
beer....With an atmosphere of
early American “rowdy," the
Pub does seem to have its
problems, for it appears to
have a definite identity crisis.
At timesit’sanicelowerMan- '
batten bar, full ofgood conver~
sation. But all too often this
quiet, respectable Dr. Jekyll
undergoes the sordid trans»
formation to Mr. Hyde.

The jukebox lights up. A
crowd surrounds_thc Fooser
ball table. Cries of anguish
and dispair arise from the
electronic pingspong machine.
People are dancing and the
place is swinging. Yes, the
Pub has become the place to
be on oampusi

Yet things are not as bright
in Main pit as they appear to
be. In the words of manager
Mark Nissen, "Things are not
going quiteas wellaslhoped."

Averaging sou glasses of
beer on weekdays and 1000 on
weekends, the Pub is Still
losing moneyi In September,
the Pub Club, Inc. last $797
and in October, It was $142
in the red. Nissen states that
“business is devine, yet
something is wrong." That is
all too obvious. Perhaps he
shouldn't throw out his “bet-
ter" customers.

Well, what hope is there for
the future?

None, I'm afraid, unless we
all go down there anddo our
fair share. Instead of going to
the library at midnight, go to

Dear Sen. Clark,

IOWA soil:

The increasingly shocking events of the last few weeks
have brought to light facts which suggest that President
Nixon has indeed had an active role in covering-up the truth
about the Watergate break-in and the activities of the Com-
mittee to Re- elect the President. President Nixon’s words
and actions have forced us to seriously question his ability
to serve as Chief Executive. The inconsistencies of his “po*
sition" with regrd to Executive privilege as well as his
. wanton insensitivitity towards public opinion have led us to
the conclusion that Mr. Nixon isnotservingthe best interests
of the country as President of the United States.

We believe that during the two Nixon Administrations the
policies of the President have done far too much to undermine
the public‘s confidence in its national government. We sense
that the events of Watergate have truly broughtabout a crisis
of confidence and a concommitant crippling ofthe Administra-
tion’s ability to cope with the serious economic and natural
resource problems which Confront us.

We realize that the United Smtes Congress has only once
before resorted to impeaching its President. But by the very
fact that there is a provision in our constitution for remedy of
extraordinary grievances against the President, we, the Stun
dent Association of Grinnell College, urge that you call upon
the members of the House of Representatives to invoke that
provision and impeach Richard Nixon, and we furtherask that
when he is impeached, you will vote for his conviction. Res
luctantly, we have come to the conclusion that only when Mr.
Nixon is removed from office mn this country begin to attack
the serious problems with which we are faced.

Therefore, on 31 October, 1973, the Joint Boards of the
Student Government Association voted by a margin of lgsltl
to urge our Senators and Congressmen to bring about the
impeachment of Richard M. Nixon.

Sincerely,

ScOtt Weil

the Pub instead. Instead of
ordering a glass. buy a Pit‘

Yes we must help the Pub
stay above water and the only
way is to submerge ourselves.

So the next time that you hear
those fateful words, "Drinks

re doing and head on down to
the Pub (or J.D.'s, Russ',
Duffy's or the Horn for that
matter). Remember, “booze

WASHINGTON, D.C.»Washingion
is a busy and serious place these
days. however, this state of ails
airs has not deterred Lynn Kamark
and Betsy Scheuerman (Grinnell's
liberaied women in Washington)
from visitingievery bar in town.

Well, perhaps Inis is a slight
exaggeration (the only one in this
'story), but conservatively, they must
have been drinking in at least 30%
of the bars here.

Alter going about a month into
the semester, Lynn and Betsy de-
termined that it was lime to drag
me out of the library, which lliad
left only to eat and sleep, and in»
induce me in the finer points of
decadent living in the nation’s Cap-
ital. Having never been exposed to
the taste of alcohol, and not quite
knowing what to expect, I was not
without some trepidation as I left
with them for an evening inGeorge—
town.

When we arrived, I made one final
effort to persuade them to abandon
their evil ways and come with me
to the Georgetown University Lib-
rary (which is a veryuice place,
incidentally, but that IS quite ano-
ther story). But my pleas were
to no avail. These two shining ex-
amples oi Grinnell womanhood were
filled with a lusty desire for beer.

By this point, trembling and filled
with fear, I entered the first bar
of the evening with Lynn and Betsy.
Lynn began to reminisce about the
Longhorn.'i‘ibove all, she missed the

" Grinnell Book

by oui§e Dix

The Cyclone staff is cleaning
out its office to prepare for the
publication of this year's year
book to come out the early part
of mid-May, according to Glenn
Sigmund, editor.

Known unofficially as The Grins
ne] Book for the past fiveyears,
the yearbook is ofﬁcially chang
ing its name from W
this year. Siginundexplainedthat
it was. wrongly given the name
m after a tornado hit the
campus in 1882. "The namem
Grimm was unofficially

' given in 1968,“ he said, "and

we've decided to keep it, feeling
that it is more appropriate."
As well as clearing out the sta—
rage in the office, the staffis subs
mitting a proposed budget to the
Committee on Student Publica-
tions and Radio and to the ad—
ministration "with the understas
nding that we will pay one-fifth
of the “SOD-$2000 debt accum-
ulated last year ach year for
the next ﬁve years."

Sigmund said he feels that the
yearbook serves the function of

Horn’s drunken farmers and country
music. Nobody in this bar even
knew where Iowa was. One seedy
looking character thought Iowa was
the name pithe barmaid. Since Betsy
made me buy the iirst pitcher (they
are not totally liberated) I missed
what I understand to be the Horn’s
more reasonable prices.

Being veteran drinkers, noisy and
Lynn were not satisfied withasingle
pitcher at one bar. We beganto roam
M and Wisconsin Streets in search
of other places to imbibe.

As we began to stumble into our
fourth, film, and Sixth bars we
realized that something was amiss.
Betsy admitted that (here was no pie
ace in Georgetown, Washington, or
probably the rest of the universe
quite like Duiiy’s.

But something of even greaterims
port was wrong. At first they could
not explain it but then, throngntneir
by now quite garbled thinking pro-
cesses, came THE TRUTH.

What Betsy and Lynn missed was
drinking with the iniamous--lhe
likes of Harry Derderian, Doii no.
nganno, John Potts, Rick Faust, Bu-
Ich Gates, Tim Fleagle, and, lasibut
certainly not least, Maren Doughr
eriy.

Now, we are all wiser, although
sicker and poorer, for our exper-
ience. (N01 to be confused with
the Grinnell Experience.) I have
vowed never to drink again,but Lynn
and Betsy are anxious to return to
Grinnell to test out the new Pub.

Their hopes are high ever since
learning from an informed sout-
ce, himself a veteran beer drinker,
that me Fun is doing a Iinebusiness
-- of course expecting an immediate
surge the day Betsy and Lynn re-
turn

Finally, I must end with a {00!-
note. Our informed source prefers
to remain anonymous but, in a city
filled with leaks, we have learned
that he is a member of ma pnlis
tical science department and is 31,
leged to have played a key role in
the creation of the First Annual
Gtiiinell relays last spring.

the school; the people involved,
the things they thought about and
the things they did."

"It is a record of the events
and of campus life in general,"
he continued, “and no matter
how anti* rah srah you are, the
yearbook is a goodrecordofwhat
your year at Grinnell was."

This year a special photography
editor, Lucia McMillan,basbeen
appointed “with the primary con
cern of seeing that every senior_
gets his picture in the yearbook,"
said Sig-mund She took an inde-
pendent in portraiture, he said,
and therefore "has the knowledge
needed for producing adequate
shots." ”There is a need for
seniors to respond as soon as
possible to her plea for ideas
of how they'd like their portraits
taken for the yearbook," he
added.

Iii: grinnen Book for this year
will probably be the same size
as last year's book and “hope-
fully Will be under $7" although
the cost is yet undetermined.
“What the yearbookneeds iswhat
all the publications need, and that
is, total campus support," Sig-
mund concluded.
