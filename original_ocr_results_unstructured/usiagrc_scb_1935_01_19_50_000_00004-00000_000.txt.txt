Details Concerning Founding
of Contests Recalled
for Students

While most of the studenLS at Grin.
nell are familiar with the prizes which
are awot'ded in various Iields of com.
petition each spring, law are acquaint.
ed with details oi their story. Since
there was a very speciirc purpose
behind the establishment of each of
the contests, Miss Sarah Innuss Mac—
Donald, head of the committee all

opinion that the students should lie
made lamiliar with the circumstances
Surrounding their foundation

lowing terms to govern the prize

to he given as a prize tor some harm
of creative art. The form of art to be
chosen and the way in which the priz.
es are to be awarded to remain in the
hands of the faculty of Grinnell col.
lege."

Awards in Six Divisions

The faculty has awarded the pr
ior work in poetry, drama, cssay,shcrt
story, music and graphic arts. How-
ever, as the income of the fund has
been overdrawn in recent years, a prize
for play writing will be the only one
awarded this year.

The income from the Worth fund,
established by Harry I. Worth of Seat.
tle, Wash. was for some years de.
voted to the purchase of a trophy to
be awarded to winners in debate and
similar contests. With abandonment of
the college speech societies this custom
was dropped, and in 1932 the donor
designated that the fund's income
should go into the purchase of books
for the student possessing the best per.
sonal library.

Whitcomh Fund Largest

The Whitcomb Poetry tund, largest
oi the prize funds, was leit by the late
Sheldon L. Whitcomb, member of the
Grinnell English department from 1895
to 1905 and, at the time of his death,
