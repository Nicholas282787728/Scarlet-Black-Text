A one year substitute [or the annual
writer's conlei'ence. the symposium is
designed to both honor English Professor

draw attention to the artisti and literary
aspects of the college, according to

taught English since 1960. and is retiring
next year

Kissane iurther explained the purpose ol
the symposium when he said that, "em
phasis tat Grinnell) tends to be on intci'i‘ias
tionai allalrs and current political events,
and tends to play down the world at arts
and letters. (However). we have quite a
number of distinguished writers.” and the
[our writers “will remind the campus" of
that other world.

Having started her career only ten years
ago [she wrote much earlier. but did not
publish), Clampitt, who is lrom Iowa, has
only recently achieved critical acclaim for
her poetry. however, in that short time.
she has become important stylistically.
"Clampitt makes a strong impression with
a poetry that is not imitative of current

iashions in poetry She is not trendy,
though certainly not oldrtashioned,”
Klssane said.

What are current iashions in poetry"
Kissane explained that "a lot or modern
poetry is light, colloquial. It is plain. tough.
unpretentious poetry. clampitt. however,
hunts ior unique torms or expression and
uses precise, sometimes erudite words

in her poetry Clampilt merges the two
worlds in which she belongs. the world
that is responsive to nature and the woi ld
appreciative oi intellectual expression

[According to Kissane, “her worlds seem to ,
' be one ot n‘at alobjécts" t,lowers trees

nature tShe also seems to take part in) the
opposite pole the intellectual world of ait

Dillering l'rom Clampitt, Hirsch has cons
ductcd his career very pi'ofeSslonally Ace
cording to Kissane. Hirsch knew that hc
wanted to be a poetwhcn he was in college,
As a Watson scholar. Hirsch studied and
wrotc poetry in London,

Kissane described llirsch as a "very
technically accomplished poet twho writes
in at moie contemporaiy. mainstream
manner (than clampittl He can be a very
clever. ingenious poet. He is a poet who
writes more in the knowledge oi what con-
temporary poetry is up to." Consistent
with these characterizations. Klssane
praised Hirsch's ability to teach poetry
and provide help and --insight into aspiring
poets and their poetry "
