prepare for

finale

By Tim noctistei-

Grinnell's men’s cross country
team travels to Pella, Iowa,
tomorrow morning to take part in
the Central Invitational. The meet
is expected to turn into a two-way
battle between the Pioneers and
their host, Central, (or the team
championship.

At Grinnell’s Les Duke Ins
vitatlonal this season, Central
came away on top of Grinnell by 14
points. While Coach Ray Ober-
millcr is certainly hoping for a
victory in the coming meet, he has
not overlooked his team‘s primary
goal this seasonea conierence
lltle.

For that reason Obermlller
has eased up little in training his
squad over the post neck He in»
tends to work his team through the
week of [all break before he begins
to let up in anticipation of the
November 5 Midwest Conference
meet. The general method for a
runner to reach his peak is to tram
hard throughout the season and let
up a week before the climactic
race. The Conference meet will be
hosted by Grinnell and will be run
primarily on the country club
grounds north of the campus,

Of the nine teams that Grinnell
will face in the conference meet,
the Pioneers have defeated [our
(C06, Cornell, Knox. and Mon-
mouth) several times this season.
The only new conference rival to
compete with Grinnell before the
fivesmile loop meet will be Beloit
College at this Friday's Coe In-
vitational. Beloit narrowly
defeated the Pioneers in last year’s
invitational.

A perennial power, Carleton
College, can certainly be expected
to provide a stiff defense of
its three-year reign on the MWC.

Following the SIX-mile race at
Coe, Grinnell will race Simpson
and Central on October 29 in its
final meet of the season,‘ Needless
to say, Oberrnillerhopes to send his
squad into that conference meet on
a winning note by upending Central
in the race at Simpson.
