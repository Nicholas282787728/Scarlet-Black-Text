tendance.—President Bradley's

According to previous

logy opened yesterday morning.
Its announcement aroused
siderable interest throughout the
state, and the attendance on the
opening day gives assurance of its
success. Upwards of twenty-ﬁve
ministers are in attendance with
the probability that this number
will be somewhat increased.

The movement for the institute
originated with the congregation
al ministers of Iowa and the ar-
rangements were made by a com-
mittee of the General Associa-
tion, in eta-operation with one from
the college faculty.

The program arranged for the
school is as follows: Each fore
noon throughout the session Prof.
MacKenzie of the Chicago Theo-
logical Seminary will lecture on

Christ, Prot. Harper also at the

evening was given by l‘resitlelltl
Bradley. His theme was, The1
Unity of Mankind. Attempts atl
poliiical unity have been made
throughout tlle course of history.
Rome,theempiresofCharlemagne
and oi Napoleon may be cited as
examples. All sncli attempts
have been failures, bill the con»
ception oi unity has not passed
away. Rome leftthe conceptions
of a second unity, the unity oi
law. Her legal system has given
form to those of all the civilized
nations, yet it is rivalled by the
common law, and as a unity it is
a failure.

Still a third conception ot unity
which has come down to modern
times is the religious one. This
conception is one of the grand
gins of the middle age to man-
kind, theoretically it was a suc-
cess bllt in practice it was a tail.
ure. Finally we have the con-
ception of a unity of learning,
given to mankind by the age ot
the renaissance. There ivas to be
one Latin known to all.one classics,
the GreekandLatin.oneliterature.
But this too passed away trom
earth in the ﬁres of civil war.

Though all of these four per
minal ideas of unity have come
down to us none of them has ever
been fully worked out in the
world. But there is in the world,
back of and embracing these, a
spiritual unity,tliatofa benevolent
purpose to serve God and man.
The old unities failed because they
lacked this benevolent idea. The
new unity, the morality otjesus,
isa living force because of this
and bids fair to reali7e itself in the
world.

The meetings are open to every-
one and the public is cordlally inr
vited to aticnd; this applies to stile
tlcnts as well as townspeople.
Those who can spare the time
irom their studies will ﬁnd it well
worth their while, This evening
instead of the recitalof the School
ot Music as previously announced
an address will be delivered by
Prof. Harper of the Chicago Uni-
versity on Recent Discoveries in
Palestine as Elucidating the Old
Testament.

We give below a list ot minis-
ters in attendance; though not
