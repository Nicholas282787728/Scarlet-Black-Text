you weren'tlhere. In fact, onlyabout
7-10 people were.

Donl-laynie andSherylSamuel.a
l960's-style folk duo fromHigh Falls,
New York, played a two-hour set of
pleasantly harrnonized,issue-oriented
folk songs, and while the assembled
“crowd" was enthusiastic throughout,
their applausecould barely beth in
the cavemous South Lounge setting.

“It was a shame," said l-laynie,
who plays guitar and sings. after the
show. “The people were nice. and
good to play to, but if we could have
had more it would have been nice."

Junior Maria Rajki was one of
the students who attended the show.
“I felt trapped," she said. “The music
was good, but the whole experience
wassortofembarrassing. ll'eltthatif
I left, they would notice."

Signs were posted in the loggias
on both Nonh and South Campus,
but most Grinnell students didn’t see
them One woman present reported
that the only sign she saw was in an
obscure location.

attributes the small tum-out to fac-

was a program for pride week going
on at the same time as the concert. so
many people were in Nonh Lounge.
And the event wasn’t printed in the
5&3 calendar. 1 also thought that a
lot of people were probably at the
library studying. something that more

all of the time.”

The location of the concert was
viewed as a problem by both l-laynic
and Rose. ”The Forum isn‘t really
associated as a place tocnjoy music,"
said Rose. “It’s more of a serious
place for serious talks."

Haynie remarked that he would
have considered the small number of
spectators intimate in a smaller set-
ting; however. in South Lounge,
“there was room for more. i don't
believe we got a significant fraction
of the campus. lhave the feeling that
it could have been really nice under
different circumstances.”

dents are not as liberal as they once
were, and that this also contributed to
the turn—out. “I have talked to [ac-
ulty, and from what tlley tell me. the
campus community is less open and
more studious. This means more
people would rather study than sit
back and relax to some music for a
while." Rose added that atone time.
three folk singers a week would play
at the Longhorn, “and people would
pack the place."

“I think that politically Grinnell
is pretty liberal," Rose continued.
“but socially it is fairly conservative.
This would explain why itscems that
less people go out period, not just to
a folk conccn on a Tuesday night in
South Lounger"

Katia Marshall, a first-year stu-
dent who attended the show, enjoyed
herself thoroughly. “1 like being in
settings like this. The music has
something to say. and it‘s done in a
nice way.” She called the :ltmo-
spherc “family»oriented."

At one point in the middle of the
show, Marshall got up and began to
danceto the music. There was plenty
of room, “I've been pretty stressed
lately." Marshall explained. “and I
haven’tbeenliving in the momencso
I ﬁgured it was a good time to do it."
After the Show was over, Samuel. a
singer and percussionist, thanked
Marshall for dancing.

Several students at the Show told
Samuel afterwards that they thought
the concert was poorly publicized.
“You should let them (the concerts

committee) know." Samuel told the
students. “They decide whcihcror not
toinvite performers back based on the
tum-out." Haynie added that he would
like to return to Grinnell someday.

Rose didn‘t feel that the low
turn—out affected the duo's perfor-
mancc. ”They have been around for
a long time and have gone through a
lot of things in life, and they under-
stood thatothcr events were going on.
and that Bob's would be a better
place for them to perform."

“It seems that tastes are moving
away from more lessor-known folk
andacousticartisls,"Roscconcludcd.

ignore their requests (for better;
