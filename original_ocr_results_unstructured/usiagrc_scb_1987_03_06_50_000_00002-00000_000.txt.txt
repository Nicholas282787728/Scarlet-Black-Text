Students compete
for SA positions

by Sylvia Bachmann:
“The SA program has been very suc-
cesstul this year,..the most successful in
. its fifteen-yeaﬂhistory," said Tom Grady,
associate dean of Student Affairs. Over 100
new candidates and 26 returning student
advisers applied for 55 open positions.
With the recent completion of this year’s
studentsadvisor selections, a myriad of
questions has arisen concerning the pro-
cess and its effectiveness in choosing the
most competent SAs. Crady, who plays a
major role in the selection process, said
that when he chooses SAS, he looks for “a
diverse group of people who will be able to
build a strong floor community and deal
with crisis Situations.”

Each candidate is required to submit an
initial application stating his qualifica-
tions and the activities in which he wil be
involved in the coming year. Also, lloor
mates complete evaluation forms on the
candidate. The “firstsround cuts” are
made after a group interview in which six
candidates meet with six evaluators; three
of the evaluators are RAs, and three are

student advisers applying for another
year are not required to go through the
same process. They must submit an ap-
plication to their current resident advisor.
According to Crady, “It is obvious to an
RA ii an SA is not doing an adequate job.
Also, the fall evaluations filled out by
students reﬂect an SA’s perlormance, If
an SA were doing a bad job, if there were
problems, this information Would not
trickle through the cracks.”

One freshman, a newly selected SA, did
not agree, and said that his SA, who was
chosen to “do a repeat performance next
year, left a lot to be desired,” “I feel this
shows some weakness of the system," he
said.

Spring evaluations oi SA positions are
sent to students this week. The recently
completed RA evaluations, however, in-
dicate that the student advisor program is
working; of the forms returned, 91 percent
of the students agree or strongly agree
that the SA positonn is valuable, and
92 percent agree or strongly agree that

producing for even the most conﬁdent of
candidates," reads the application}

 

students who indicated an interest in help
ing the selection process. During this first
interview, candidates have a chance to ex-
press themselves to the group, and briefly
to an evaluator one-on-one, Each
evaluator keeps documentation in a hands
book, and the strengths and Weaknesses of
each candidate are discussed and record-
ed. “The process is very structured to
assure fairness. Everything is
documented,” said Crady. “After cons
sidering the lists of strengths and
weaknesses. candidates are marked as
‘Preierred,’ ‘Acceptable,' or ‘Unaccep-
table' by each evaluator; it no ‘Unaccep-
table' marks are made, the student will ad
vance.” The floor evaluations are con»
sidered in the first cut only if a question
arises as to the candidate‘s acceptability.
in which case more input is required.

In the final interview, students meet and
talk on a more personal level with two
members of die Student Selection Sub-
Committee. Two evaluation sheets are
kept for each student. The candidates are
rated for specific skills such as adaptabilis
ty. dependability, communication skills,
attitudes, and maturity,

keep from getting wet. “We just didn’t
want to go up, It wasn't that we were think-
ing we should wait down there, it was just
the act of not going up,” he said. Rescue
workers and the state highway patrol
began arriving at about 9:00 pm. after be-
ing called by biology proiessor Karl
DeLong, McCluskey's husband, and Eric
Hippo. another Grinnell caver. Blietz had
telephoned them shortly after Andreas
emerged from the cave at 7:00 pm.

Dubuque's Iowa Grotto Team entered
the cave around 12:30 a m., after the
stream had been completely dammed.

 

“living in residence halls has been
beneﬁcial." There was a 44-percent return
rate on the evaluations. Crady adds, “Ree
taining SAs maintains a sense of continuity
in the program, and second or third-year
SAs provide good role models for students
coming in."

“The process must be
working...somehow," said a junior. “I
didn't get selected for my sophomore year,
and have‘not re-applied, BUT I have had
really excellent SAs all three years."
Crady encourages students to reapply,
however. He said he feels that students
who were not chosen should have the “op-
portunity to talk” to him and “discuss why
they were cut.” If it is important to the stu
dent to know where his weaknesses are,
Crady thinks it is important for him to help
the student, “When we made cuts, we
made them for good reason.”

A last word, this from the student aid
visor application: “Sometimes the selecs
tion procedure can be anxietysproducing
{or even the most confident of candidates.
We hope that we have created a system
which is not only fair, effective, and effi-
cient, but which will be a helpful ex-
perience for you, whether or not you are

They removed the bodies of McCluskey
and Price, and pulled Bart and Stone out of
the cave. Andreas, Bart, and Stone were
temporarily hospitalized for observation.

Tederman said he did not believe Mcs
Cluskey had been “negligent in any way.
She had an obsession for safety," he con-
tinued, “and would not have taken anyone
into a dangerous situation," “It‘s not like
Kathy was to blame, she was very
courageous," commented Bart.

All five of the students involved express-
ed their gratitude to the people involved In
the rescue operation and to the college
community for its support.

SGA notes

by Kirsten Pullen

The March 4 meeting of Joint Board was
called to order by SGA president Ali ElSaf-
far at 7:30. The first item on the agenda
was the approval or a letter expessing the
senator's sympathy for the families of
Grinnell faculty members Kathy Mc-
Cluskey and Mike Price. _

‘ SRPC reported that afl three initiative
proposals passed. The civil righs in-
itiative proposal passed 5m to 77; the
Equal Rights Amendment initiative pass-
ed 474 to 107; and the Kindred House in-
itiative proposal passed 476 to iv.

PASF allotted $127 to Amnesty Interna
tional for membership fees and for airmail
letters. Amnesty international originally
asked for $197.44 to cover the Cost of books

also. but PASF declined because they
thought that perhaps the money could
come trom other areas. Amnaty Internas
tional is resubmitting this part of their
budget. Also, PASF gave $131.29 to the
social concerns task force to help fund the
dinner they held after the Nicaraugan Fast
for Peace. Joint Board disapproved this
funding, and held a lengthy discussion
about the need lor PASF support since a
fundraiser is designed to pay lor itself.
The social concerns task force asked for
these funds in order to make a donation to
Quest for Peace with the money generated
by the dinner instead of paying for the din
ner. The discussion of this funding was
tabled because there is a question of the
legality of sons supporting a charity.

When I did a piece on Robert
Noyce, began to get interested in Iowa,
having known very little about it. One
thing is that Iowa's record in education is
so amazing....I think its one of the parts of
American history which hasn't been flush-
ed out yet.

 

 

Scarlet and Black:
If the ’705 was the “me decade," how
would you describe the ‘805'?

Wolfe:

Late in 1979, I found myself on a television
Show in which after I came up with the
“me decade,” I was asked to say what the
805 would be like. I frivolously replied, “It
will he the purple decade." My idea was (1
wish I’d followed it up and done something
about it! that the pursuit of status...would
be much more naked in the 19805 than the
705 or 605, and I used the word purple as a
“royal purple." That phrase was then
superseded by another, which is “yuppie,"
which 1 love and is marvelous — much
better ﬁlan any other phrase I can think of.
