Campus activism tries to find a common cause

By Karin Bellon-ty

Can advocates of differenttheo-
ries of social change find a com-
mon focus that enables them to
strive for change together’.7 Tho-
mas Nelson and Kevin Schmidt,
seniors, are exploring the answers
to this question through an inde
pendent class. advised by Associ-
ate Professor of Antiuopology Jon
Andclson.

Among the social change their
ries and critiques Nelson and
Schmidt. have delved into are deep
ecology, which supports the aboli-
Lion of the hierarchy of humans
over nature, and social ecology.
They have explored the ideas of
Bellhooks, a black feminist who
wants to bring more black women,
and men ofailraccs, into the femi-
nist circle, They have looked at
critical theory based on Marxism
and psychoanalysis which says that
we live in a society where we are
notin touch with our true needs and
interests.

Theprohlern with all of the theo-
ries they have explored, says
Nelson, is that each one is inad-
equate by itself. All of the theories
have limitations and do not neces-
sarily succeed in viewing the whole
picture. The goal of the indepen-
dent class. explains Nelson, is to
“search for common ground in dif
ferent theories that seem to exclude
somethings."

The purpose of the Common
Ground torum, which took place
Sunday, was to see if different or
ganizations can find a common
ground and focus in practice, not

Alanna Walen, who was the SGA representative at the Common Ground Forum

just in theory, Organizers of the
open fonim also hoped this would
beanopportunityforcampusgmups
to share and break down stereo-
types of each other. Meredith Levy,
one of the tiltan forum organiz-
ers, deﬁned Common Ground as
groups beginning to think together
and ﬁnd the potential to act to
gether. Organizers tried to design
fomm activities that would facili-
tate this.

Nelson and Levy emphasized
tttat the {mm was open to all cam-
pus groups, whether they be reli-
gious. sports or social change

groups. One disappointment ex
pressed by Levy was that even

though they had invited all types of
groups, the ones that attended were
mainly those working for social

causes, “The point of this is not to
be PC; it is to include everyone.”
agreed Nelson.

Nevenheless, people who at-
tended the fonim are enthusiastic
about the idea of uniting campus
organizations in this way, and some
discovered the existence of groups
they previously had no knowledge
of. “People are [now] much more
aware of the possibilities; every-
thing [seems] interrelated," com-
mented Megan Miller of the Envir
ronmental Action Group.

Alanna Walen, student group li-
aison and parliamentarian of SGA,
expressed similar feelings. “The
bestthing[aboutlookingforacom-
mon ground] is helping us to see
how there are ways for [groups] to
work togetheron accomplishing our

different goals," she said

Dustin Smith of Christian Fel-
lowship thought that a positive as
pectofthetorum wasthatthegroups
that were represented were very
interested in how they could Work
together. He felt that the people
there“werereoeptivetowhatlsaid."

One idea that interested people
attending the forum was tttat of
networking through a newsletter or
some kind of bulletin board,
Through networking, the entire
campus community could become
aware ofall the groups on campus.
Also, since frustration was ex-
pressed that people don't have
enough ume to work for all the
groups they would like to. many
thoughta newsletterwouldbeideal
for promoting awareness of com-

mon causes for which different
groups could work together.

“If [groups] can get links they
can get a lot more accomplished,”
said Rachel Bly of the Campus
Democrats. Miller added, “We
could really use [networking] as an
information resource, to find out
what other groups are doing and
whathasbeensuccessfulforthem,”
Networking would also be helpful,
said Miller, in “ﬁnding out about
what works and what doesn't from
other groups.”

However. campus group meme
bers do soc drawbacks in trying to
search for a common focus. Carin
Bringclson of students Against
Apartheid hopes that Common
Ground will not become an Addie
tional group that will draw a lot of
energy away from the already ex-
isting groups; that could cause
people to give up on the idea alto
gether.

In addition, Nelson has found
frustration at the lack of ethnic and
politicaldiversityof the groupsthat
want to participate. Most of the
groups at the forum, for instance,
were those who take a “leftist
stance," said Nelson Other particir
pants agreed, expressing a desire to
get more right-wing organizations
such as the Campus Republicans
involved.

Common Ground organizers
hope to hold a follow—up session
that will teach people about practir
cal skills in organizing groups, and
in networking.

“We could see the foundation of
what might happen by the end of
the forum," said Levy.

Students find strong party split in campus Gulf War poll

In a poll taken by Wendy Smith
and Joel Krueger of the Probability
and Statistics Math 336 class, 55
percent of Grinnell College stu-
denm surveyed said they were op-
posed to the Persian Gulf War. 19
percent of the snidents surveyed
were in support of the military ac-
tion and 25 percent were not sure
how they felt about the conﬂict

The telephone survey was cone
ducted two days after hostilities
ofﬁcially ceased between the UN
forces and Iraq. Respondents were
asked to voice their opinion at the
following statement: “I believe the
U.S. policy of military interven-
tion in the Persian Gulf was the
bestpolicy." Respondents were then
asked to clarify their position by

stating how they would have
handled the Persian Gulf situation
it they were the President of the
United States. Over 50 percent of
students surveyed said that they
would have waited longer for sane
lions to work beforepursuing mili-
taryaction. Respondentswcre then
askedquestionsaboutthefrequency
with which they read world and
national news or watched news

repons on television. Finally, each
respondent was asked to give their
place of residence (north campus,
south campus,oroIf-campus), their
class year, their gender, and lheir
political affiliation. 84 students
were contacted and 83 chose to
answer the survey questions. 16
studcns were unavailable for con-

that political affiliation was a fac-
tor in people's decision about the
Gulf War. 75 percent of those con-
sidering themselves Republican
supported the war while only 11
percent of those considering them-
selves Democrat supported the war.
25 percentof"Republicans“ and69
percent of ”Democrats" voiced op-
position to military intervention in
the Persian Gulf. 20 percent of
those who had no party affiliation
voiced support for thewarwhile48
percent voiced opposition. Factors
such as gender, residence, and class
year had little bearing on student's
responses,

The results of the survey sug-
gested thatstudcnts who read news
papers or newsmagazines onadatly
basis are influenced more by their
political party affiliation than stu-
dents who read the paper less
frequentlly.

Although investigators Wendy
Smith and Joel Krueger were not
surprised that the majority of the
students disagreed with the policy,
theyhad expectedto findarelation-
ship between the amount of time
spent reading or watching national
news and student opinion about the
oturpoliey. They speculated, how
ever, that many students may have
been reluctantto admit paying little
attention to the news.
