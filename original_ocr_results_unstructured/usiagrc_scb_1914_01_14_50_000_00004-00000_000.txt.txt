DEAN JAQUA LEADS CHAPEL

Talks of Need for Broad-minded-
ness in Grinnell.

lir. Jaqua spoke at Chapel Teiisdau
morning on “The Need of Broadmind-
cduess in Griniiell."
the talk was as toliows:

Each or us pi-obshly has only halt
a dozen intimate friends in school, but
we should none the less have a iriendh
reeling toward all our comrades. All
true Gi-iunellians rejoice in the SHCV
cess or others as is evident in athletic
contests and even in classes. Under
ideal conditions, there would be no
jealousy, lint rather a great generosity
oi mind. Tile danger in college is that
we limit our ii-iendships to a certain
house, clique. or clas

Another danger to criticism. Criti-
cism is relentless. This is an use of
criticism. We are all her liable to
iiidse too quickly. Everoiie or US
should hare inoic generosity or mind.
that is, the t he or mind that will not
permit us to l tcu to idle gossip. Not
until iic do this will we have real
generosity oi mind. We should he gclt
omits also in our . ilsinohts oi olllct
societies and classes.

Beginning with this new rear eiich
one at us should make it resolution to
be generous and iair-mindod. and ltt
able "to see all around the point:
