Myers added that Discofesi was
scheduled on the same day as
Gospelfest. She didn't make an ac-
cusation that the event was pur»
posely scheduled as such, but that
the coineedeneo was unfortunate.

Myers said that when she met
with the five men sponsoring the
Disco week, they stressed that the

 

event was a parody. In response to
this concept, Myers said that the
event was “not funny.” She added
that the tone of the event is “very
disrespectful."

Tandeka Stanbztck was also
“shocked and outraged” when she
discovered that SGA had passed
the Disco resolution. She said of
SGA’s action “that really hurt."
Stanbaek stated that in general the
resolution was “very insensitive to

Slanback added that one of the
things that made her very angry
was the people trying to justify
something judged offensive by
Others,

Stanbttck was tnsensed by the
fact that some people Just did not
understand that others were of-
fended by Disco Week and that
they did not understand how Disco
Week was offensive.

This,saidJepsen,isone waythe
college can adjust to student de-
mand and posstbly offer more than
one seminar on the same topic.
These multiple seminar sections
would be taught by faculty from
different departments and would
focus on the particular discipline's
approach to the topic.

With agoalofapproximzttely 15
students per seminar, at least 25
seminars would have to be offered.
This plan clearly alters the faculty
course load. “The faculty will have
to make adjustments in order to
participate."saidJepsenHowever,
suchadjustmentsarelikelyloresull
in changes in department course
offerings rather than additions to
the faculty. The latter, said Jepsen.
W|11 be increasingly difficult he '
cause of budget constraints. Ber
causeanyformal facultyaeuonwill
not occur until the upcoming aca-
demic year, a pilot program for
seminars within the
interdisiciplinary concentrations is
in the planning stages for next year.

However. according to Jan
Czechowski, assistant dean of the
faculty, such a plan may not be
achievable because of time con-
straints and the necessary seminar
planning for faculty members who
are interested in implementing the
trial program tor the 1991-92 aca-
demic year. “The question 15. how
many faculty are in a position to
spend time to develop a new
course?” said Czechowski,

Therefore, the upcoming year
may serve as development time
rather than a trial basis. The actual
required senior seminar plan, if
approved and carried out as pro
posed, may not be implemented for
two to three years.
