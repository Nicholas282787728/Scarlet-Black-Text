Misch Kohn whose arr will be
cxhibltcd in rhe Grinncll college
Print and Drawing Study Room, is
an artist of incrcdiblc innovation
whose work includes an cxrcnsivc
varicty of styles. The majority of
Kohn’s works are prinrs, and many
know him from rhe influence he has
over prinrrnaking. Kohn has devel.
oped many new tcchniqucs and
used rradtrional reehnroues in non-
tradirional ways He conrinuousiy
challenges himself and orher arrisrs
ro move beyond whar rhey know. “I
know rhere are people who just use
rhe medium ro do whar rhcy already
know," he said “And I just don't do

Kohn, horn on March 25, 1916
in kokomo, Indiana, wanred ro be
an aim even as a child, and his par-
enrs supporred ltis desire. His cdu»

months at the insrirure. A nearby
museum had an exhibit ofmodern

IIOOGIIIE

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Staff‘X/ritcr

The organ: the Ford F-150 of
musical instruments, with a sound
so large it could beat the pants off
an clltire army of violins any day of
the week.

This Sunday, concert goers will
have a chance to hear rhe organ's voa
luminous sounds in a live perfor-
mance by Grinnells own College
Organist, Keith Sadko. Sadko, who
has srudied and raughr organ per.
formanca at a number of universie
ries in she u.s., Canada, and lraly,
has selecred a program of quintcs~
scntial organ music by four Roman»
ric composers for Sunday’s reciral.

“It’s ninereenrh century music
from essentially Gcrman compmv
crs," said Sadko, noting that al-
rhough one ofrhe composers, Franz
Lisa, was really Hungarian, “he
worked in a German musical
world.” .

Although the program will not
include any works by Bach, the Ger-
man organ mastcr of the Baroque
era, a second unifying rheme of
Sunday’s concert will b: the slum
sions [0 Each embedded in a num-
ber of the pieces. Explained Sadko,
“The Germans still adhere to a m:-
dicval rradinon [ofcxtcnding] the
musical alphabet by one lcttcr,” This
means rhar in Germany, B-ﬂat is
assigned the letter H. For some cs-
peeially crafry composers, this
means that one can spell thc word,
“EACH" in musical lcttcrs and thcn
turn rhe nore sequence inro an cnr
rire fugue. Sadko will perform four
such Bach-inspired fugues by Rob-
ert Schumann and one such Prelude
and Fuguc by Liszr.

Another factor that Sadko con»
sidcrcd when h: sclcctéd Sunday’s
program was how the music would
be suited ro rhe particular organ in
Herrick Chapel. Unfortunately, “ch:
organ in Herrick does not accurately
represenr any particular rradirion,"
said Sadko, “but it is. ..[most closely
suitcd to] the nineteenth ccntury.”

In fact, the inability for the or-
gan in Herrick ro aurhenrically rep.

lica'tc the sounds oforgans from car»
llL’I‘ periods has prompted Sadko
and othcrs to investigate. the possi-
bility orrcplacing rhc old organ.

Sadko explained rhar his current
project ofrcscarching the history of
the organ at Grinncll led him to
some discoveries about the organ’s
construction. At tlt: start of the
rwenrierh century, sadko said, rhe
trends in instrumentepmducrion
had led manufacturcts to equip or-
gans with elecrric means ofopen.
ing pip: valves. Though this tech-
nique saved money, it also caused
the organ to 10:: some capacity for
arricularion and pipe conrrol, or in
essence, ”to lose its idcnriry.”

Thc organ currenrly owned by
the college, said sadko, was pure
chascd in 1949, when instrument
makers were just beginning to turn
away from :lcctric rrcnds and srrive
again for historically authentic or-
gan production. “Ar the rims, the
organ was srare ofrhe arr. tr was
very forwardrlooking orcrinnell as
a collegc to put in that kind ofin-
srrumcnr when rhcy did," said
sadko. srill, in the fifty years since
rhe eollege purchased the organ.
consrrucrion techniques have
evolved to allow for :ven closcr rcp-
lication ofhistorical organ sounds.
Also, in the past fifty ycars, said
Sadko, thc Hcrrick organ “has had
no major maintcnancc.”

To simply repair rhe organ could
con ovcr halfa million dollars and
would only extend the life of the
instrument by about thirty to ﬁfty
years. sadko rherefore is invcsrigat-
ing rhc possibiliry ofusing rhe Fund
for Excellcncc and private dona»
tions to purchase a new organ that
relies on mechanical aetian, rather
rhanelccrriciry. Anew organwould
last for centuries.

For now, however, Sadko will
stick to performing music by the
Romanric organisrs. The program
lisr includes works by Schumann.
Johannes Brahms, Josef
Rhcinberger, and Liszr. The reciral
