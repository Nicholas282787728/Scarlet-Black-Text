Dear paul render,

I would like ro rhaak you for supporring rhe recenr
SGA by»law changes in your arrlcle “The People’s Elbow"
alrhough you did nor inrend ro. By emphasizing howlirrle
srudenrs know ahour SGA and how disconneered rhey reel
ro lr, you have made a similar argumenr ro rhe one 1 gave
before Jolnr Board when rhe by-law ehanges were fun pro»
posed However, 1 assumed rhar srudenrs would wanr ro
have someiniluenee in an organiearion rhar handlesagrear
deal oisrudenr money eaeh semesrer and rhar, on occur
sron, lssuesand resolurions are presenred as encapsularing
srudenr opinion as a whole.

But it is an inaeuracy when Mr. Pender dcscribes rhe
changes as given more power ro “select" people. Beforc
rhe ehanges, all campus dL‘CISIonS were made hy ‘select'
people, wlrhour any direer lnpur from rhe srudenrs. Ifhe

he does nor pay arrenrion ro did nor just “sweep" rhis

your philosophy rhar real sclﬂgovemance occurs with in-
dividual srudenrs, However, 1 eannorwareh a sysrem rhar
