10 Golfers Begl
Daily Practices;
Card Tentative

Ten golfers have been practicing
daily on the Crinnell country club
course since the appearance 'of
spring weather in preparation for
the opening of the golf season, ac—
cording to Rollin Hunsicker, golf
captain.

“The golf schedule is tentative
as yet and has been presented to
the faculty for approval and we
are hoping to have this taken care
of within a few days," he said.

Only two lettermen return from
the 1935-36 squad which enjoyed
a successful season. They are
Hunsickcr and William McFarlin.
Because of the lack of lettermen,
positions are wide open, according
to Hunsicker and the competition
is keen.

Candidates whose play has been
outstanding so far are: Ray Goode~
now, Robert Ellis, and James Cam-
eron. all of whom were on the
squad last year, Paul Biklen and
James Ramsey.

A as hole medal play qualifying
round will be played among the
members of the squad to determine
the players' ranking. Six men will
represent Grinnell in the meets this
spring.
