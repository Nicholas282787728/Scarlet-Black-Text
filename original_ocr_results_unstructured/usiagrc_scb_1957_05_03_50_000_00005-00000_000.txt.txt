convocation only points to a
iairly consistent policy ot the
administration to- bring in the
new and forget the old. Why
was it necessary, assuming that
the weekend is advisable, to
bring in a “professional” to do
the organi ng when there is
suiticicnt machinery on campus
to do a good job without sicpr
ping on toes?

In short, it is a poor
or not consulting students, of
doing what other schools have
done, rather than what is good
for Grinncll, what has been
done at Grinncll and worked
what can be done at an old
school iull oi tradition, and most

R. Bowen’s estimate for fall enrollment is betueen 920- 940
students, including town students. This estimate, however,
does not refer to the total residence capacity.

pacity at between 520-530, and
the total women's at 430. This
women's total includes the use
or either Pine Tree cottage or
Mears, and alterations in Cleve-

a possibility or reaching this

This increase in residents nec-

change is the proposed renova-
tion oi Pine Tree or Mcars, This
will not be attempted unless the
enrollment tor next. year is
large enough to warrant such a
change, but plans are seriously
being considered by the admin-
istration. Freshman w o m c n

Mears Needs Facilities

it Mears is used, only the sec—
ond iloor will be used, and
plumbing and other facilities
will be necessary, Dean of We-
men Evelyn Gardner has stated
l that, should one or the old halls
be opened, it will probably be
Pine Tree.

the event that an additional
hall is opened, M. E. Hannah
said that a” new house presi—
dent will be elected or, .more
probably, appointed, The
board has constitutional power
to make such appointments.
‘Changes in Cleveland will in-
clude renovating the now un-
used rooins in the basement and
moving the foods department to
the ilrst floor 'of Mcars, thus
making room for more-student
rooms. Throughout the rest of
the Quad, rooms that are new
unused or which are dispensable
to the present occupants will
be utilized, Sauers stated that
the present rooms occupied by
students will be little changed:
"Where we have empty beds,
we hope to hit them, but we
won't move in any more beds
except in unoccupied rooms.”

Some Men’s Quadruples
To accomodate the increase on
north campus, more men will be
placed in some rooms, in the
older halls, some ot the three.
