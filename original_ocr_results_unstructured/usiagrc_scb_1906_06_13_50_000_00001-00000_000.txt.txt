A \\ cek or two ago a general azale-

prominence or educated mm in the
World’s \lork. Let me hringthestute-

There ate in the directory or pnhlic
men called “Who's Who in America,“
about 14.433 names, or wil h number
10,615 have given educational data.
Oi this number nearly 0,400111'9 college
graduates. Hence nearly slooo oi the
number giving educational data are
collegians, or about 70 per cent.

Everyman has a religiouﬁactive,

areligion. The vital question ior us
is not, ‘sllall We have a religion?‘ Thai:
ls Settled b) nature. The question of
importance is, '\\ill:it shall be the
character of our religion,’ for that is
to be settled by ourselves.

Religion is the Outd‘eaclllllg of our
