the ReLays should parody such competi-

Drake Relays (the inspiration for the
name), and give students an opportunity
to relax and have a good Lime. The
organizers also believed that. in aca-

Letters from the Old World

Part X—Train Travel
By Riva Sharples, Foreign Correspondent

 

RAIN novel is not the romantic adventure depicted in old Hollywood movies. Although Eurail is relatively

I simple and efficient, it is not free from its share of delays and problems. In the past month, I experienced

exciting and fnisuaung train travel as I gallivanted across Europe. My first real train trip was a 20-hour

joumey from Amsterdam to Venice. The ride started one Wednesday on an overnight train bound for Munich and

eventually, after a train change, 10 Venice. Adam, my uaveling panher, and I were excited. We thought that traveling
all night on a train sounded kind of fun, maybe even romantic. Our naivete' didn‘t last long.

The train was standing on the platform when we got to the station, so we boarded it 15 minutes early, ﬁnding
an empty compartment Unlike BritRail, which has uncomfonable seals smashed together like in the economy class
of an airplane, Eurail uains have “private" companmenis that hold six seats. Nicertrains have curtains, to draw across
the door and window for added privacy.

I had my first frusuating experience two hours into the trip. I was thirsty, so I left Adam to watch the baggage
as I went in search of the buffet car. I walked the entire length of the u-ain, past sleeping compartments, pasr old men
playing cards, through the smoking car and past phone booths, butfound nothing. Even on the shortest trip in Britain,
there was always a drink and snack buffet available. Adam and I sat feeling bitter for nearly an hour. I cursed myself
for not knowing, the uain service for not having something as simple as a buffet and Adam for having the bright idea
of splitting a bottle ofwine with me before leaving Amsterdam, because the wine was now making me very thirsty.
“I’ll just jump outai the nextstaiion and get something from a machine," Adam said. That was mucheasier said than
done. Sometimes the train stopped forlcn minutes. sometimes for two minutes, sometimes only for30 seconds. We‘d
take ourchances. At a large station, we saw a big, brightCocarCola machine gleaming in the distance. Adamjumped
off the train and made adash for it. He had no soonerjumped off than we staned to moveagain. I yelled and he made
a dramatic, story-book leap for the train. That was the closest our train u-avels ever got to a Hollywood movie. We
didn‘tgetanytlling to drink that night except for a small amount of water from the restrooms. Despite the big Waming
signs saying NOT to drink the water. we drank anyway and survived. We would have been able to doze and forget
ourthiisthad it not been for the brightslation lights and theannoying train ofﬁcialschecking our passports and tickets
every few minutes. It was ironic. When we left Amsterdam, there had not been a soul on the train. But aroluid
midnightjust when we wanted to sleep, they all seemed to come out of the woodwork to OUR compartment. Adam
and I were awakened five times during the night to have our passports checked (we can’t figure out why. .. there
aren ‘tlhat many countries between Amsterdam and Munich ! l) and our tickets were checked afterevery majorstation.

After resting in Venice for a few days, we decided tobrave another ovemight train to Paris, which would have
been okay had we not had to switch trains in a place called Lussanne. We couldn'tfind the town on our small map,
and nobody in the Venice train station spoke English. so we had no clue whattime we would arrive there. We decided
that if the trip was anything like the other one, we wouldn't be sleeping much anyway and couldn’t miss our stop,

It was 7:00 am. when Adam and I awoke. Glancing out the window, I noticed that we were in Geneva,
Switzerland, and the platform information panel read something about Spain. Suddenly, we both had a sinking
feeling that we had missed ourstop and werenow headed in the wrong direction. The whistle blew, giving usabout
30 seconds to evacuate. We didn't have our shoes on and our stuff was strewn across the compartment. We jumped
up, stuffing things into our pockets and bags as fast as we could. Adam opened the window and threw out our shoes.
I grabbed the rest of our things and we jumped off the train moments before it staned to move. We had indeed missed
out stop but luckily we were able, by paying a few lines, to hop on an express for Paris. We actually arrived in Paris
an hour earlier titan we would have originally.

In Eisiiem Europe, my train adventures were much more scary. Those harrowing adventures and my tales of
Venice,city of canals and waterways, will be the subjects of next week’s letter. Until then,be thankful you are where
Llain travel is virtually nonexistent, and where you don't have to put up with the smells, the dirt, and the grime (and
I don‘t just mean inanimate grime either!) of Eurail.
