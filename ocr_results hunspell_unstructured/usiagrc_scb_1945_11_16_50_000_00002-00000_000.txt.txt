Music Notes - -

A recent unfortunate incident which

occurred when several music students
attempted to practice on Sunday in the
music building calls to our attention a cry-
ing need. The music students need a place
to practice in the evening and on Sundays,
and the college makes no such provision.
Especially in his junior and senior year,
the music major needs long hours at the
key-board. In those two years he must
prepare two recitals, involving the memo

rizing, at times, of complete concertos. But

Club Adopts Constitution

The first meeting of the Span»
ish club was held in the Main!
Hall drawing room last Tuesday
Jack Bringolf,
reviewed the purpose

under the present rules, he lnust do this in'
the morning and afternoon practice hours
allotcd to him.

The history major is not told that he
nlay work upon his major field only certain
hours during the day. The library is avail—
able to the econ major in the evenings. On
Sunday afternoon, the English student may
brush up on his Sllakespez We feel
then that an injustice is being done these
music students who, though ill the minor-
ity, should have every opportunity to de
velop what is with many of them a deep
love for and devotion to their field.

We would suggest the opening of Pine
Tree, already a “day time” practice house,
to music students at all hours at which the
library \is open. Difficulties encountered,
because of the large group oi" music stu-!
dents could be avoided by limiting Sunday]
and evening- att'endance z the practice!
building to junior and senior music stu»
dents, who are doing their advanced music
work. 1

If it would be impossible to have super
vision—and this is advanced as one argu»
ment against doing anything at this time
—\\‘S submit that this is a good place to1
begin broadening and expanding the Honor
System. It would be entirely up to the in-
dividual student, or to group of students, to
he on good behavior in the practice rooms
or to have the privilege revoked . . . and
because the opening of a practice building
would be so convenient for all students iue
valved, there would be no toleration of bad
practices by other music students.

We maintain that juniors and seniors in
college either can be trusted now or never
can be trusted . . and they will not be
followed through life by a faculty chair
clone to see that they are never alone in
a building at night.
