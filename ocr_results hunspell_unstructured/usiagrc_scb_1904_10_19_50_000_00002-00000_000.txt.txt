HE Schooiol Music Recital Course

an unusual opportunity. The fee tor
tor the course is absurdly low. Tire
cost for asinglc evening to the holder

there are twenty evenings It may be
ur-ged;that these recitals occuron study
nights and will interior-e with routine
work. Tlri ‘sasu‘pel‘ﬁcrul reason lor

recitals begin at seven and end at
eightro‘clock, leaving the balance of

and ditch consequent involuntary nar

fessions and in business.

There is a side of Musical education
which is attainable 'by everyone, the
education achieved by listening to
good music. us it is possible for all to
understand and appreciate the best in
painting and in sculpture by seeing,
though never having held abriish or
chisel: asitis possible rov every one
to understand and appreciate the best

in literature, though never having
writtenmore than a triendly letter;
so it is possible tor everyonetnacquire
an understanding and a general an
pveciatioir oi music by listening to it
though never having struck a cord or
tiravvn a bow. The enrichment and
gladness which such appreciation oi
around litcrt . e brings to the whole
mum is something which cannot be
over-estimated. The Recital Course is
commended to all as something good,
and as a very vital iactor in education
and culture.
