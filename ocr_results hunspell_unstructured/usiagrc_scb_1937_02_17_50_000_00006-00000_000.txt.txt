tobacco just as it comes out of

the 1000 - pound wooden hogs-

If you could be there when these hun-

tobacco, prime and ready to be made

into Chesterﬁeld Cigarettes . . . see the

golden color of the leaf . . . and get a

whiff of that delightful aroma . . .you’d

say...

"Delicious . . . makes me

Mild, ripe home-grown and aromatic Turkish tobaccos. . .
aged three years... make Chesterﬁeld an outstanding
cigarette... give them a more pleasing taste and aroma.
