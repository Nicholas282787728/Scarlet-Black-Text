am. daily, the faculty chapel com

sentatives, decided yesterday. The
proposed change was approved by
the faculty Monday, 1

Although it was originally planned
to change the chapel period to 101
am, the time it was formerly held.
thc 11 o'clock hour was found to bcl

more suitable to all departments. 1

Aids Practice Teachers

The alteration means that here,
after classes will be held at 3, 9, 10,1
and 11:20 am. The second and thlldl
hours, under the new plan, will co-l
incidc with class hours in Grinncll

teachers to handle their work with}
out disrupting their college clossl
schedules. ‘

There is an additional advantage
in the 11 o'clock chapel period in
that there are more students on the,
campus at that time than at any,
other hour which could have been‘
chosen.

problem of keeping chapel within the

asked to keep their addresses limited‘
to eight or nine minute to allow for:

Grinnell Strength in Mile,
Two-Mile Events;
Pilbrow Stars

After losing the opening dual mect
of the 1932 indoor track season to
Iowa State collcge, the Grinncll
tracksters will make a strong bid
for victory when they embark Fri-
day for Des Moines where they meet
the Drake university Bulldogs that
night. Coach G. Lester Duke's men
Lumed in several good performances,
but lack of balance was in evidence.

Coach Franklin (Pitchl Johnson’s
Drakc runners downed the University
of Nebraska team, Winning out in the
milc relay to earn victory by a slen-
der margin after Nebraska men had
placed one-two in the 440 yard dash.

Smith Sui-prises Fons

Frank Smith, veteran blue and
white sprinter, surprised the fans by
taking first in the high jump and
broad jump, as well as the 50-yard
dash. Captain Collins come through
with a first place in the pole vault
although he failed by inches to break
the fieldhouse record.

Coach Duke uncovered a promising
hurdle!" in the personage of Wally
Grounds last Saturday. Grounds
showed his heels to the Cyclone Yul"
RBI”: in the high hurdles, Winning in
:07. He will meet strong opposition
in Del Pullrebdlac and VValliei' Still-
well, Drake hu-rdlcrs.

Thomas Favorite,

Grinnell strength lies mainly in the
mile and two-mile events with Myron
Pilbrow and Joe Pfeiffcr forming a
combination that will be hard to
beat in either event, Co-captain
Thomas is a favorite to take the
quarter-mile after breaking the field-
house record at Ames.

Dick Murphy will probably find
strong- competition in Leonard
Gallagher, to whom the lion’s share
of the credit goes for the Bulldog
victory Saturday, in the half-mile
race. Alexander should push Smith,
the Drake ace, in the dash, while w.
Grounds is capable of attaining the
same height as Smith in the high
jump.

Thomas, Pilbrow
Smash Records

Although Pioneer ‘racii repro-
sentatives broke two existing ficld-
house records at Iowa state college
Saturday, their efforts were not suf-
ficicntly balanced, and the Cyclones
showed them under, 65 2-3 to as 1-3.

Hank Thomas clipped half a second
off the quarter mile record when he
stepped the distance in :51.3, shatter-
ing the old mark held by Calium of
Iowa State. Just as outstanding was
the performance of Myron Pilbrow
who traveled the two-mile distance
in 991.1, knocking 37 seconds off
the old record.

l’leiller LUM‘S

Wallace Grounds, Pioneer discov-
cry. showed exceptional promise in
taking first in the high hurdles cm-
.ichnson of Iowa State. The only
other Grinnell victory was in the 50-
yard dash, which Alexander captured
' 7. Grounds tied for second in
the high jump, reaching 5 feet 7
inches.

run to Chapman, Cyclone star, but
