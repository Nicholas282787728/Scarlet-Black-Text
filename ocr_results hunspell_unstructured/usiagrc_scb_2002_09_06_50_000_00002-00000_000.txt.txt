worked with Krohn ro develop a speciﬁc budget
proposal this summer, studenr Affairs has begun
providing Bob’s wirh a $10,000 standing budget
each academic year, Bourdon said.

“The hope is mat with the $10,000, Bob's will
brealc even," Krohn said.

TheTrcasurer's oiriceolso zeroed out Bob's debr
[his summer so rhey could smrt wirh s fresh slate.
said srudenr Airairs head Tom Crady.

"Bob's is nor independent and never has been
because rhe college holds the food servioe license,"
Crzldy said,

“They have a year to rry and inalre n,” Crndy
said last spring.

The ndniinisrrarion's precise role in subsidiz—
ing Bob's is uneloar to managers and start,

Bob's opened rhis year as a non—Smoking cslab-
lishinenr. This chnnge occurred panlally because
ofthc possibility rhar rhe town orcrinnell would
pass an ordinance eliminaring smoleing in all food
service establishments, Bourdon said. As yer, rhe
ordinance has not passed.

“[Theswiich to non—smoking] was forced upon
us," O’Donnell said, “Bur we decided ro give a
liule to gen little [and] sray open."

Students had rold Krohn that rhey would go
to Bob's ifnotfor all the smoke, she said. The healdi
survey students responded [CI last spring showed
only 10.14 percenr ofGrinnell srudenrs smoking.

some staffmembcrs feel that the “loss oismolre
ing derraers from Bob’s characrer," Bonrdon said,

“[Some] srudenrs say rhey'll never come down
here [now rhar Bob's is non—smoking," Rosen said,
“but most studenrs are supportive . . . after talking
ro the stall?"

Bob's has reeendy begun replaclng irs furnirure.
Theyve also hired an aesthetics manager to “make
ihingsseem more comforrable and inviting," Rosen
said.

It’s aehallenge ro be elm wirhour seeming srer.
ile, Rosen said, However, rhe currently empty wall
and ﬂoor space wdl not be empty for long.

“I personally believe than in rhe log run Bob's
hasn’r Iosr too much," Bourdon said. ”It is up ro
studenrs [a decide if Bob's will return to what ir
was.

“[Bob‘sl is shifting from on idmlogiul space ro
