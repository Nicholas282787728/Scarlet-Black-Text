so now that most ofthe pain of
MonicaGatc has passed, what is go-
ing on inside the clinton White
House Perhaps moreimportantly,
on to what has Congress moved?
The latter question is more disturb-
ing, for as long as the bloodthirsty
Republicans were intent on the Im-
peachment nonsense, and then sub»
sequently eating their own, they
could not screw up as much in
terms ofreal action in our main leg-
islative body.

Oops. The knuckleheads are up
to it again. it is a shame that we
cannot send them all on some
NATO fact-ﬁnding mission for
three months and have a couple or
monkeys take their places, OK, so
that is abit out ofthe question, but
can't we at least keep them caged?

Wednesday in the House of ‘

Representatives discussion was held
on HR 472, a bill that would allow
tor local review and scrutiny ot
Census 2000, If enacted, the bill
would require a “hurryup” of the
tabulation of the Census by the
Government. Following this, the
information would be provided to
39,000 local governments, who in
turn would be allowed to scrutinize
and contest the results otrhe cen-
sus. This process would take
months. and wane into the latter
part or the year. Then, by my cal»
culation from the numbers in the
bill itself, the Census bureau would
have roughly one month to inves—
tigate the local governments claims.

This is ludicrous. First, lam a
firm believer that you should never
put the work of the Federal Gov-
ernment in the hands of locos, I
mean locals. (Oops!) Sccond, the
time trams for all of this unrealis-
tic. To think that local bureaucra-
cies will be able to file a complete
claim in 45 working days is crazy,
and then to possibly think that the
Census Bureau could review and
rule on all the claims in a month is
insane. Republican Dan Miller
trom the 13th District of Florida
introduced this bill, and I am just
wondering what he was smoking at
the time, cause it must be damn
strong!

In a press statement released
Wednesday by Vice President Al
Gore, the VP repeated his convic»
tion towards making this census the

The current administration
(Rusty K. Osgood) ignores the
students.

Quite often I hear how much
the administration wants to lis-
ten, but actions speak louder
than words, and the
administration’s actions
are a slap inthe face.

In the beginning the
issue was a simple mis-
understanding. The ad-
ministration has been
forced to work within a
restricted budget, this is
decided by the Trustees
and is beyond the con-
trol of thc administra—
tion.

The administration
dictated thatTom crady
trim his budget to fit the
restrictions ofthe Trust»
ees.

Torn chose to reduce
personnel through job
attrition, eliminating the
soon to be vacant RLC
and Director of Student Activiv
ties positions. This was entirely
Tom’s choice, made without con»
suiting anyone, and personally.
I respectTom for standing up for
his decision in the aftermath of
student outcry

However, in my opinion and
the opinion of many of my fel-
low students, Tom‘s decision was
a mistake.

We have clearly and loudly
expressed this opinion and taken
creative and productive actions
to solve the problem, including

most accurate census ever. “I feel it
is important that we count every
American for one simple reason:
every single American counts."
Gore stressed that HR 472 would
disrupt the schedule or census
2000, and reduce its accuracy as
well.

I will not say it often, but Gore
is tight. _

This measure will undoubtedly
slow the process, thereby creating a

disturbance in the normal proce-

dural tasks that occur in Washing»
ton following the census, These
tasks of course include the most
prevalent, the Fauslian bargaining
between Democrats and Republi—
cans on gerrymandering the elec.
toral districts. Still, it should come
as no surprise that the Democrats
are in arms about the census and its
fairness and accuracy. usually, the
broader and more accurate a cen-
sus is, the more it favors the Demo-
crats.

This is, like everything else they
do in that City of Sin (and you
thought drat was Las Vegas—HAD,

ing in Washington. OnTiresday, an
Executive Order was issued by the
President officially designating the
Federal Republic ot Yugoslavia
(Serbia/Montenegro), Albania, the
Adriatic Sea, and the Ionian Sea
north ofthe 59th parallel, as well as
the air space above those places, as
combat Zones.

Now this may not seem like a
big deal, but an email from a source
1 have that works on high—speed en-
cryption at the National Security
Administration conﬁrmed to me
that this was a procedural step in
the pentagon’s movement towards
a fullescalc military endeavor, My
source could not supply any more
intormation, or how exactly the in.
formation was obtained, However,
I must say that this source has not
misled me once since she has joined
the NSA.

ifa fuli.scale military endeavor
is what we are headed for, then that
means ground troops. Moreover, I

in spite of our continued
concerns about the loss of the
two Student Affairs positions,

and our willingness to solve the
mistake, we have been ignored
and brickwalled by the admin—
istration.

Osgood has decreed, in‘a let.
rer to the campus, that nothing
will change. The decision has
been made, student opinion
does not matter to him

This has become much more
than a simple budgetary issue,
it is now an issue of self.gover—
names and administrationstu-
dent relations.

ifsclf-governaneo was strong,

not some elevated period Ofrccruit»
ment. The Serbian pcoplc have
proved their tenacity, and for some
reason, Clinton seems intent on
pursuing this to the end. Neverthc»
less, is it worth the price we beat? I
posit this: on the ﬁrst dayofbomb»
ing, we dropped over one hundred
million dollars worth of bombs
That amount would buy twenty
million hot lunches for starving
Americans. Seems to me THAT
would be a worthy causc.

Is there human suffering in
Kosovo? If you read Zotka Milin's
guest column last week, you would
think not. She claimed that what is
going on there is a lowdcvol civil
war. Well I don't know for sure, but
I seem to think diat rounding up
ethnic Albanian men, then shoot-
ing them one by one as they are
forced to watch each other die, is
inhumane. It is not a war act. In a
war, there is a struggle for power.
The ethnic Albanian people seem
to have none, and that to me seems
like slaughter.

There is no doubt Slobodnn
Milosevic is an evil man. I doubt
any person in the world would con-
test that he has committed numer-
ous human atrocities. Still, I won-
der: what can the United States do?
Tuesday was National Holocaust
Remembrance Day, and yet how do
we show what we have learned From
atrocities so long ago? In bombing,
allwc are rcallydoing is exertingour
much larger military muscles to
harm people who have no power in
relation to us. That rather makes us
the same as the Serbs.

So what nowi Isay there are two
ways to go about military action,
one is full out, and the other is fall
back. The United States needs to
stop wasting its money, and start
ﬂexing its brain, to figure out ifwe
really are willing to lose lives over
this situation.

All the information for this col-
umn was obtained From United
States Government websites
(www-.whitehouse.gov

welcome any and all comments,
and I encourage everyone to write
to their United States Senators with
their thoughts on these issues. Your

and the administration re-

speCted us, we, the administra-

tion and students, would be

examining the budget to real»

locate the necessary funds (per

haps from the security budget
or even from outside
Tom’s budget). Instead,
we are at odds because the
administration has not
accepted a partnership
with the Students.

I, personally, came to

Grinnell in the hopes that
the college would be a
mentor to me, and not a
dictator. I came to
Grinnell with the belief
that my opinion would
be respected, and that I
would be able to work
towards solving my griev—
ances. Now, the admin—
istration has left me with
out any construCUVc re-
course for solving my
concerns.

It is clear to me that
the administration docs n0t un-
derstand sclf-governancc or the
relationship ofstudents and the
administration.

Please, take the time to e—
mail Osgood and explain these
core values to him.

Also, please take the time to
explain to prospective and ad»
mitted students on campus this
spring, that the administration
is not listening to students and
until that situation changes,

into two Gtinncll alums, Tim and
Terry. Tim graduated in the early

Terry greeted me similarly.

“Grinncllians had a lot longer

AsTerry and I continued to talk,

cesses of Grinnell student life.
He attempted to illustrate what
he dubbed the ”work hard, play
hard” mentality to one of his
colleagues. “I mean Grinncll was

siblz. As much as I would like to
live up to my promise, I have not.
Academic burdens and postrgradue
ation plans have taken dieit toll. But
there is hope. I was recently re-
mindcd about a tradition unlike tiny
other at Gtinnell. A party, dubbed
"Neutron Bomb," has in recent
memory cappedeoff the school
year. Neutron Bomb, like Waltz
and Disco, is well organized and
features a dizzying array of drunk
dressedeup parry people. Further,
many Neutron Bomb veterans
have declared the event to be a
“really, really good party" which.
of course, is still not unusual.
What is different about Neutron
Bomb, however, is its “invitation
only" policy, The lucky few who
are chosen [0 attend the'itifitst
year become the organizers their -
senior year (some experts dis-“
agree, claiming that only those
who have attended all four years-
are entitled to organize) and
thereby the tradition carries on
with some continuity. While “in-
vite only" parties are held all the
time, only Neutron Bomb is an
entrenched and relatively well-
known tradition. For me, thewhole
idea and process of Neutron Bomb
smacks ofpettysophomoric elitism;
yet, I kind ofhope I get invited.
Why not make the party open
to whoever points pay their share?
The organizers could just tell a few
first-ycars that they are responsible
for organizing the party and die tra-
ditiun would continue. In ten years,
when we find ourselves charting
around a keg on alumni weekend,
wouldn't it be a much more posi-
tive experience ifwe could reminisce
about Neutron Bomb knowing that
anyone who wanted to go was able
to?

 

Celebrcl’re Pride

"Frteyour mind and the rest willﬂllaw. . . ”
—Ert Vang:

Hello, out therel I have been
having a fairly interesting, but
stresshrl week. However, lhave been
attempting to relieve some of my
academic stress by attending the
various events in celebration of
GLBT (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual,
Transgendered) Pride Week 1999.

on Tuesday, I heard lectures
from two veryinspirational and inc
tellectually stimulating individuals:
Yaroslav Mogutin (a Russian writer
and political refugee) and Dr, Elias
Faraiaie-Joncs (a AfricanAmeriean
bisexual activist and divinity pro-
fessor) . Mogutin talked about his
experiences as a controversial gay
writer in Russia, his subsequent
media censorship, and his persecu»
tion by the Russian government.
FatajaieJones talked about gay
black sexuality in a lecture entitled
“Bodies Matter.” Both speakers
shared some oftheit personal writ-

ings (i.e., poetry, prose, articles) to
illustrate their passion for social,
political, and cultural equality and
tolerance, regardless of sexual ori-
entation,‘race, color, ethnicotigin,
creed, or religion,

As I sat in South Lounge, at
4:30 pm ai‘ad ayin at 3:00 p,m.i
I was ehilled by the speakers in—
tense spirit, energy, and ideas. '

Both Mogutin and Farajaje»
Jones made me diink deeply tor a
long time something that I was try-
ing to “get away from" for a while.
hour speakers forced me to be both
introspective about my feelings in
regard to issues of sexuality, race,
ethnicity, and politics and critical
of existing social structures (i. e.,
government. education, religion
etc).

The information and ideas pre.
sented at these talks has not only
expanded my perspective of the

world, buthas also helped me to un»
derstand my past and present and
has given me extra courage and de-
termination to construct a some-
what radical political, social andcul-
rural future. From now on, in my
studies here at Grinnell College and
elsewhere, I will study hard to un-
derstand the predominantly biased
Eurocentric theories that American
insritutions are largely based on.
However, 1 will also question these
theories and propose alternative
methods otreconsttucting out aca-
demic, cultural, political, and social
paradigms so that they are less or if
possible, are in no way biased or e>te
clusive. Mogutin and Farajajeejoncs
have changed my world in just on:
day and now, I am committed to
take acrion.

So, what are you going to do?

Thanks to the organizers of
Pride Week 1999.
