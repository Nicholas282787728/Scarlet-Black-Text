ica Stands. " “It is a disgrace to Amer-
ice," he said, “and the people who do
it cannot have a. true understanding
of democracy or liberty." His final‘
words were: "it we can raise an army
of two million men and spend billions
of dollars in the prosecution of the
War, we can Stamp out this insidious
example or German kultur."

Ledd spoke on “The Kaiser’s Peace
Propaganda." "The peace propaganda
or the kaiser is one or our most dan-
gereus foes," he said. He mentioned
drive
which brought forth President Wile
Son’s statement of the war aims of
America and the allies and spoke of
the unfair attitude in which it was re»

‘ceived by the German government.
