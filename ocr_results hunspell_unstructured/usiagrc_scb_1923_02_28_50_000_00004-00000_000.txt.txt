Famous Hllmamtarlztn to Tell Ro-
mantic Story of struggles of
Labrador People.

An epic story at the Nortllluutl will
ibe presented by Dr, Wilfred T. Gren-
icll, the iamous humanitarian, in the
dim number oi the lecture course on‘
the evening oi liar-en 9.

The scene of Dr. Gleniell's labors
has been the bleak and barren coast
oi Labrador, inhaliited by a small
resident permanent population which
is augmented each sumliier by some

coming troin Southern Newloundland.
Nova Scotin, and the Maine Coast.
Wilell the ice cuts oil commuication
with the outside world and the float-
ing population has departed, boats are
laid up and part or the hospitals ess
tahlisiicd by Dr. Gren‘tell are closed.
Dog teams are then used and long
patrols established, slvathcd in
u llldrpl‘ool' garments thordoctors or
the International Grenicll Association
and their helpers travel over hundreds
‘iol miles oi windswept and icy bai-
rens, - the frozen bays of the North
Atlantic.

His remarkable accomplishments ill
spite oi seemingly insurmountable
diiticullies have brought Dr. Grenicll
many unsought honors. King Edward
VI conierred upon the Order of Com-
panion of st. Michael and st. George
