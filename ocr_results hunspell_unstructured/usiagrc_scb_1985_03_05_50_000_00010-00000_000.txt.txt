History, Structure, and Current Activities of SEA I

in this essay we would like to discuss
the aims, methods. and structure oi
Students to End Apartheid (SEA).
Blessed by increased interest this year.
SEA has altered both its structure and
its strategy. We will iirst address the
most recent oi our activities. the
meeting with the trustees several
weeks ago. and then turn to a discussion
oi the recentshiit in the methods oi the
group: a shiit towards‘ pragmatism
resulting in a plur isiic approach to
the entire apartheid issue.

On February 1 representatives oi
SEA met with three trustees for a little
over an hour. in contrast to past years,
the meeting was marked by a strong
sense oi cooperation between the
trustees and the students. This years
proxy resolution and a divestment pro
posal were the primary issues discuss
ed during the luncheon. Last tall the
group prepared and submitted a resolu-
tion to Oak industries asking that they
run their operations within South Airica
in accordance with the Sullivan Prinr
ciples. These principles. on reserve in
Burling. address equal employment.
pension plans. housing plans. career
advancement. etc. With respect to the
minority groups. Uniortunately Oak in»
dustries. which received two resolur
tions at this nature. has requested to the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) that these proxy resolutions be
dismissed because Oak industries has
only iive percent oi their total concerns
within South Airica, We are waiting tor
a decision by the SEC on this matter. it
the proxy is upheld one or the members
oi SEA will attend Oak industries yearr
ly board meeting to present the proxy
tor a vote. incidently. according to Oak
industries. which makes electronic
parts tor the media and the military.
they will be liquidating all oi theirSouth
Airican subsidiaries. In the meantime
we can only vote on similar resolutions
presented by other concerned groups to
other corporations Grinnell has stock
in. Next year it will be possible to target
a new corporation.

Divestment was discussed with
respect to a proposal being prepared by
members oi Students to End Apartheid.
During our meeting with the trustees
last‘ fall we were told that as far as the
trustees were concerned the issue oi
divestment involved two issues: a
moral issue and an economic issue.
Prior to that meeting the economic
issue was essentially ignored by the
students. in the past SASG members
have felt that the moral imperative im-
plicit in the apartheid issue outweighed
any économic arguments. The trustees
we spoke with said that they would be

responsive to a divestment investiga-
tion that addressed the economic issues
like reinvestment as well as the moral
issue.

During the meeting last month SEA
presented a preliminary outline tor our
divestment proposal The iinal proposal
will include discussions concerning the
problem or precedent. the iailure ot
“constructive engagement.” the
economic implications oi reinvestment
ior Grinnell. partial versus total
divestiture. and the eﬂect divestiture
has on oppressed peoples in South
Airica, just to name a iew. The
estimated length oi the proposal is 1520
pages and SEA hopes to present itto the
entire board at their May meetings this
spring.

Members of Students
to End Apartheid

The trustees were very impressed
with both our work and our attitude We
asked that the iinal proposal be a joint
product at both the trustees and the
students; if We can work with the
trustees throughout the writing oi the
proposal problems that might other-
wise have proved troublesome can be
resolved prior to presentation oi the
iinal copy, Not only did the trustees
agree with our request. but they ar-
ranged a special meeting with SEA dur-
ing April in order to discuss the iirst
semirpolished drait. Several trustees
have commented on the increased
sophistication of the groups eiiorts. and
at present things look very positive with
respect to student/trustee relations
Both the changing at SEA's attitude
towards the trustees and the changing
oi the groups name tiormerly the South
Airican Support uroupl are indicative
oi much more substantial changes in
the group itseli Eiiorts at working with
the trustees began about 14 years ago
when the students were able to per
suade the trustees to adopt a resolution
calling tor the trustees to address
moral issues in relation to investment
policies. Although the South Airican
Support Group lSASGl itseli began in
loot the primary interest in the early
70's resolution was also South Alrlca.
in Fall i981 and Spring 1982 there was
a considerable amount oi activity
within SASG as well as a heightened
tension between SASG and the Board of
Trustees. During the spring semester
SA§G presented the trustees with a
written moral argument advocating the .

complete divestiture oi all South Ali-lea .
related stocks within the college's port-
lolio Amid the din oi over 200 prOr.
testing students and iaculty. a cnmr
promise was reached. Following thet
storming and subsequent occupation at
Windsor House. students were granted‘
the authority to represent Grinnell Col-
lege at corporate shareholder
meetings. Acting upon that conh
promise. this year's SEA submitted the
Oak industries proxy resolution men~'
tioned above. ,

while the past has been marked by
conirontations with the Board oli
Trustees as Well as large student
demonstrations with speakers. music.‘
and chanting. this year the group is
working with the trustees and'
demonstrations have given way to,
silent protests. The reason tor the
change was purely pragmatic. ii SEAr
hopes to expedite the elimination or
apartheid via economic pressure then'
pragmatic considerations require that '
SEA built a credible. nonrantagonistic
rapport with Grinnell‘s trustees, Wat
believe that we have taken the initial
steps in building such a rapport. '

Such pragmatism runs throughoutA
SEA. instead oi limiting our eiiorts
with a single goal or method. the struo .
ture oi the group allows lor any
reasonable and relevant goal to be pur-i
sued At‘ present the group has iour
loci: til we are using the leverage we'
gained through the 1982 Compromise to'
iniluence the economic position oi

these issues in very iniormal meetings.

By our approaching the issue through
several channels we ieel we can best ‘
help end the apartheid government and .
its racist superstructure. SEA is
always happy to see neii laces and hear .
new ideas. The more directions our
group can attack ironi. the iaster the ‘
racist policies oi apartheid can bei
eliminated.
