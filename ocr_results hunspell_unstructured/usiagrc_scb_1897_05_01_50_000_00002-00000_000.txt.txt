Tm: RECEI action taken by the
Y. M. C. A. is one which will be
heartily endorsed by many or' the
Students who have noted the sour
stant effort which it has cost to
meet the expenses ot the lecture
course under the system in
use during the last three years.
Tlle receipts this year (ell short
oithe necessary amount and the
Y. M. C. A. is left with a small
debt. This is partly due to a
combination of circumstances cal-
culated to affect the Y. M, C. A.
course, and partly due to the [act
that the audiences, large though
they have been, have been unl‘e~
sponsive to the appeal of the or
ganization, and have chosen to
accept something tor nothing, rEr
(using to pay for that which they
have been ever ready to enjoy.
Under the regular plan the Y. M.
C, A. paid all expenses and usu-
ally had a small surplus at the
completion of the course, Under
the last system no surplus has
been expected, but since expenses
even cannot be met in that way, it
has seemed best to return to the
old plan or_a modiﬁed torrn oi it.
While we deplore the fact that
this change will work to the dis—
advantage ot a few, yet the sup
port which the new method re-
ceived was such that there was
nothing to do but to abandon it,
The course of Y. M. C. A. enterr
tainments is always considered as

one of the regular features of the ,

college year, and is supposed to
receive proper support But since
it has involved an ever ineleasing
struggle to meet Cxpenses under
the plan used during these last
three years, the chief mistake has
been in continuing it thus long,

As a novelty it was successful; as

a settled plan it has been a tail-
ure. A plan whereby course tick-
ets are sold and seats may be re
served. will we believe prove a
much better one both for the or»
ganization and [or those who at-
tend the course
