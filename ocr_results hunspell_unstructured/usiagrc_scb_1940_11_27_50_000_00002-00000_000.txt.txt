O The Charge
To the Editor:

Ti. seems to me that the Scarlet and Black has
failed in its function as 8. news-gathering agency
for the college. Several changes in major or
minor details of Lhe organization and adminis-
tration of the college have been made Without
the‘ student paper's reporting them.

As a. result, Wild rumors have been flying
about campus and \Vlll continue to fly until the
Scarlet and Black presents the facts concerning
the various changes.

ihfary Ellen

G The Answer

The Scarlet and Black has long had the rep-
utation on the Grinnell campus of being
nothing more than an official announce-
ment sheet, a veritable pawn of the ad-
ministration

With this issue, the Scarlet and Black
has more reason than ever before to be
known as little more than ”The Official

A ppleby

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Announcement Sheet,” for Monday after
noon the faculty was presented with a plan
calling for a total revision of the college
cul lcululn. The proposed plan vitally ale
[acted every student planning to return to
Grinnell next year. The plan is of utmost
importance to all connected with the col,
lege. And yet, the Scarlet and Black car-
ried no story. ,.

President Stevens said the plan was not
ready for presentation to the student body.
We disagree. The proposed plan, as it now
stands is of vital interest to the student
body, The changes the faculty may make
are of utmost importzmce to the student
body. The completed plan which will go in-
to effect next year means everything to the
student body In accord with the fundav
mental rights of every democracy, the in—
dividual has a right to know the changes
that are going to take place in his society.

The Scarlet and Black admits that it has
no right to know what goes on in committee.
We concede that the little squabbles and ar-
guments that take place in faculty meetings
have no place in a student publication. But
we desire to print the action resulting
from these meetings that has a direct con-
cern with the student body.

And changes in curriculum certainly
important to every Grinnell

should be
student

If the President feels that the Scarlet
and 131an should be forced to print the re-
sults of student government, then by the
same token should the student newspaper
have the right to know what happens at
faculty meetings.

Our hands are tied on the matter. Uni
til the administration sees fit to throw light
on the subject, rumors will continue to run
rampant on campus, and facts will grow
more and more distorted, The Scarlet and
Black wants to print the accurate infornm»
tion for the student body We will do so
as soon as the Administration releases it.
In the meantime, the rumors will naturally
grow.

To the Editor:
A further indication of Grinnell
indolence is the attitude maul»
rested toward campus publica-
Lions. Grinnell's delegates to the
recent national convention of
Sigma Delta Chi learned that
Grinneu has a. number and variety
of student publications greater
than that of any college of Grin-
nelrs size. Grinnell's delegates
were more surprised to learn that
Grinnell publications have a freer
dam of expression unlimited in
comparison with other college
publications. Here, there IS no
“dictatorship” of policy other than
that of common sense and good
taste. Grihnoll journalisfs have
been able to develop common
sense and good taste because they
have been unhampered by dictar
tion.

Very few other colleges of 750
students can see their way clear
to pubush a. newspaper twice
wceldy. rlew colleges, irrespective
of size, have been able to create
a literary magazine of the con-
sistent high quality maintained by
TANAGER. Very, very few our
leges dud universities have been
able to issue both it Literary mug
ezine and z humor magazine Few
colleges have printed at freshman
handbook, and virtually no ool-
leges have distributed, free of
charge, a, campus blower, not to
mention distributing u student '
rectory. men the larger univer-
sitlcs have not attempted an
alumni publication, and few col-
lcges have upheld “excellent" rat-
ings on their animals. Grinnell
has done and will continue to do
all of these thingsr

College publications thrive on
good constructive criticism, but
they die and die quickly when
that criticism is of the chronic
"gripe” variety. There isn't a

Grinnell publication which hasll’L
at least ten openings for students
who would wish to try their idess.
There is ’t a Grinnell publication
now operating with a full staff.
Grinnell is known from coast to
coast for her publioelions, and
the apathetic student can think
his local god that a minority stlll
remains with guts enough to
carry on

v—Jolln McCuuo, sox

To lhe editor: AS a Grinnell stu-
dent, I feel that something should
be Said concerning the inefficient
telephone service which has been
the rule recently, Whether this
condition IS due to faulty wires
or faulty operators, the fact re-
mains that the college lines are
colder than c pawn»broker's heart.

The principal difficulty seems
to rest in getting outside lines,
after breaking through lhe ba
riers set up by college central.
Between the time the d‘ulcettones
of quad operators assure you that
they are awake, until town cen-
trill answers [here is time enough
to write a. letter, or to catch e
short nap, Such action may be
good institutional hygiene, though
I doubt it.

Special Chapel Services
Planned for Thanksgiving

A special Thanksgiving Chapel
will he'lleld a: 11 o'clock Thurs»
day morning in Herrick Chapel,
Dr_ Stevens will speak at lhe sel»
vice and the Vesper choir will sing

(Shubert) and a Bach Chorale.

ministration reaction. The results
of this survey will be presented

first of lhe second semester.

The members of the committee
which drew up the plan are

Latin, Evelyn M. Boyd, assistant
professor of English, Isabelle

science, and wilhulu J. Rusk, pro—
fessor of mathematics,

New Curriculum
Sen’r to Faculty

Also discussed at the meeting
were plans for a proposed change
in the curriculum of Grinlicll col-
lege. Pres. Samuel H. Stevens
said, “At the present time a sig-
niflczlnt study of necessary
changes is being made. Meetings
are being held to decide upon a
broad revision of the present cur-
l'iClLlum.”

Before any definite action is
taken, howcve President Stevens
says he is him us to discuss the
proposed changes with students
now enrolled at Grinnell.

“When these revisions are come
pleted, it is our hope to make
Gi'innell the outstanding liberal
arts school in the nation,”
