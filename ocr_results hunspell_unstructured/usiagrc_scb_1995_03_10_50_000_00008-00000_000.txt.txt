Multiculturalism, as is, isn’t
working at Grinnell
I have been pondering Chris Pallas’s edi-
torial on multiculturalism at Grinnell for
welloveraweeknow. and have read with
interest the responses to that editorial 1
ﬁnd myself moved, even compelled, to
join this importantcampus conversation.

Allow me to begin by saying thuti

munity gain at better understanding ot’Just
why we seem to be having a problem

torials left me with a profound sense of
failure as a teacher; almosteverythrng he
said told me that there is aserious discone
noct between what the faculty wants stir
dents to“get"zrboutmulticulturalism and
what students are “getting."

Grinnell College, like most of the
rest of the U S., is suffering from u fondue
menial misunderstanding about what n
mullicultuml education seeks to achieve,
His argument that multiculturalism is im-
possible because no one has time to take

need to raise the level of our discussion.

on to the hard work of fellowship.

Mr. Pallas said it himself when he
talkedabouttheneedtodiscardtheas-
sumption that“everything was done ﬁrst
and done bestby white European males.”
Anoducatedpersonneed notknowevery-
thing about every culture in order to un-

culture is only one ofmany culmres. We
nwd not have met everyone on eanh in
order to know that we are not alone. We
simply need to explose ourselves to key
concepts about the relationship between
culture and history and the environment
and economy in order to appreciate that

cial, no one is “first" or “."best Every
culture has its own meaningandintegrity,
If Grinnell students think that a pcrson
must take specrﬁc, contentrbascd courses
to acquire that undersmnding. then we
have done a poor job ofconveying the
meaning of multiculturalism to you.
Similiarily, ifstudents think that this can
beachieved by casual exposure to friends
from other cultures, we have done a poor
job of conveying the complexity of the
matterzind the need fordisciplincdrigorin
this pursuit.

Mr. Pallas, Ishare with you a genu-
