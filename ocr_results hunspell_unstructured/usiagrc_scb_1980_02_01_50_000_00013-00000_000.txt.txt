Radicalism and the search for justice

Some thoughts on Radicalism (yes,
this is the S 8: B)...

It is easy to become wrapped up in
domestic problems here in the United
States and to spend much time solving
them. After all, money's got to be
earned, those barriers preventing
economic security must be hurdled,
children must be brought up, services
kept up, government kept functioning,
human-created threats to life
thwarted, Little is known or felt about
the basic and cruel hardships suffered
by a great mass of humanity, hardr
ships not seen as common to Western
life since the Industrial Revolution.

The perverse problems many
Americans expend their energy on
are, indeed, luxuries, And luxuries are
not usually seen as luxuries unless it
is clear they are unessential compared
to a deeper need elsewhere. Thus, it is
convenient and less painful to remain

a reinstitution of the “old relation
ships" because they were once so
comfortable for us’?

A confrontation over the Middle
East is building Currently between the
US. and the Soviet Union. Isn't it time
to realize that the torccs moving
toward such a confrontation do not in
clude you or I, but are at another
level, a self»iiitei‘ested pair of
economic plunderereclasses vying for
the domination of the weak?

As a system, our global society is
amazingly socialized; we have ra»
tionalized work, nature and every
mechanical relationship devised, Yet
hummanity is not cooperating, The
capitalist and communist systems
have socialized human production and
increased our accomplishments a
thousandrfold, but each are basically
antagonistic systems, ruled by elites.
For man to sustain himself, live free

Little is known or felt about the basic

and cruel hardships suffered

by a great mass of humanity.

ignorant of global suffering.

Materially, much has been ac-
complished for our benefit; this is all
that seems Important. But the tribute
that has been exacted from the poorer
nations has only grown larger as time
has gone by, It is their pain, not ours,
The maldistribution of economic
power has been institutionalized; the
system tlexes enough to adapt to
revolutionary changes in technology,
but is never basically altered. Western
nations have long dominated,

But American and Soviet spheres or
influence, the First and Second
Worlds, are steadily being subverted
by a dynamic and anti-imperialist pro
cess A Third World power is creating
difficulties. Iran, and just as
unastonishingiy, Atghanistan, are two
convenient examples of the Middle
East variety which use lslam as a
vehicle for identifying that all imporr
tant independence. Iran has lashed out
against the U.S., while anti-Soviet "in
stability in Afghanistan triggered a
Soviet protective response.

The West, so effectively in control of
technology, has too long used that
power in a casual, seltish way with
global cconseouences. The level or ir»
responsibility yet grows. Has that fact
ever crossed your mind? I realize it is
January, 1980, patriotism is running
high and all, but is it right to fall back
on the virtues of the West, to attempt

'Febmor’y‘iinao

from most diseases, to be freed irom
the hardships ot lighting tor daily exr
istence and allowxng development of
the individual, are all attainable for
mankind. Yet the institutionalized
economic injustice thwarts freedom
and this development of the in
dividual. For us to survive, the
systems must be democratized, the
control of technology must be socializ-
ed, since the consequences of the
system are so social. Domination by
private interests must be replaced by
democracy. The free provision of the
neccessities of life must be made
posstble.

There are many students at Griniiell
with a concern tor change. The
essence of human advancement is a
key to liberal arts, and understanding

of the world’s needs is a responsibility
of those living in the world's
wealthiest nation. The Grinnell
chapter of DSOC (Democratic
Socialist Organizing Committee) is at-
tempting to join together students in-
terested in learning and change. We
want to better understand alternatives
and progress. There are about 57 other
campuses around the country with
DSOC chapters, 3 clear indication of
interest.

Radicalism is not a hobby for the
bored, not a crutch for the cynic or
depressed humanist, but a concern for
bettering the world and a realization
that existing systems are inadequate
and unjust. The group will work to
enlighten and stimulate the campus;
much needs to be understood about
our responsibilities, especially toward
Third World nations, where a new
system will soon emerge, rejecting
imperialism and economic feudalism.
The West must be prepared to under
stand or perish, End of harangue.

A tew thoughts on the town meeting
on draft registration-

It was heartening to see so many
people assemble for one event. There
were about :75 present, South Lounge
has seen few better meetings. The
turnout showed a widespread concern,
and the discussion and comments in~
dicated a general confusion in people‘s
minds about the issues of registration
and the draft

For the next few weeks, Grinnell
DSOC and other students will be
organizing events at which students
can learn and act, The registration
push by the Washington war-mongers
is activating students all over the na~
tion into a potent lobbying force. The
fight is on now, and organization must
take place. The basw ethical and
moral issues are the same as always, ,
but the present Soviet aggression is a
complex new part of the problem.
Energy issues, women’s rights, cone
stitutional questions and the obscenity‘
of militarism and nuclear weapons are
all involved. All i can suggest is: keep
thinking about it. We need the brain
power.
