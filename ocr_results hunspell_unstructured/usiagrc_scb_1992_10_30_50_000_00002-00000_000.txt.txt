Siam speaks
of findings

by Aida Ruilova

Given the economic and political
instabilityof Russia at themoment, it’s
compelling to think about the possi-
bilitiesthata toreign countrydedicaled
ta aiding the Russians in their nansi-
tion to a free-market agricultural
economy would encounter. Adam
Siam. a Senior and a double-major in
Russian and economics, had the op-
portunity of such an experience this
past summer in Stavropol, Russia

The internship wasin conjunction
with the newly established Russian»
American Agribusiness Center, The
center was founded by the Iowa Inter
national Development Foundation, a
groupofprivatebusiness leaders whose
main goal is to provide Russia with
new methodsof producing food while
at the same time, broadening opportu-
nities for the establishment of Ameri-
can markets.

Stam’sintemshipmainly involved
serving as a translator for the Ameri-
can director of the center who did not
speak Russiani One of the main prob-
lemsplaguing large enterprises inRus-
sia, according to Slam, is the disparity
in the prices of inputs versus what
individuals earn for their outputs. As
of now, input prices have risen two to
three times faster than prices for out-
puts. Obviously, as Slam puts it, pro,
ducers “are going to hurt a lot”

Inﬂation is another huge problem
for farmers The chances they are
being asked to take when investing are
very risky due to their inability to ana-
lyze indeﬁnitely the consequences of
their investments The third problem
cited by Starn is the longstanding So
viet mind-set of attachment to the tra-
ditional way of producing their crops.
Despite theseproblems, however, there
is some optimism.

First, the land in Russia is top
quality soil which, given the proper
technology, could be extremely ben-
eficial Second, Russians are taking
the inltiative needed to bring about
changes in their farming, For the most
pan. people are open to new ideas and
lothe technologyintroduced by Amerir
cans. One sure sign of this is the
overwhelming success of the harvest
of this season which was made pos-
sible by Americanmachinery andseed
genetics. Resrdlslikcthcse, saysS‘tam,
provideatremendous incentive for the
effons that need to be exerted in the
present and beyond.

CR'S, Spectator gagged by thieves

In what appears to be an anony-
mous auack on “conservative” thought.
items of literature have been stolen
from the Grinnell College post ofﬁce,
including most of the prinlrrun of the
Grinnell Spectator and items distribr
uted there by the College Republicans.

College Republicans president
Trevis Parson described how his orga—
nization found SOOcopiesoftheAmerl-
can Conservative in the recycling bin
outside of the bookstore. They re-
placed them in the post ofﬁce, he said.
but they disappeared a second time,
this time for good.

Spectator editor Mike Washbum
has had similar problems. He ex-
plained that, shortly after his ﬁrst issue
was placed in the post ofﬁce, College
Republican's executiveEtic Hanmann
noticed that they were missing. He
found them in the satne recycling bin.
and he replaced them in thepostofﬁce.
They disappeared a second time.

Washburn found the papers again

and has decided to distribute his publi-
cation notjustin thepostofﬁcebut “in
more places than these individuals will
be able to ﬁnd."

Similarly. other items placed in
the post of rice, in accordance with the
mics, have disappeared into recycling
bins. including anti-ERA leaﬂets.

Parson said that these actions in-
dicate a lack of respect for everybody
on the part of whomever is respon-
sible. “It is a clear free speech issue,"
he said. “They are taking away access
to that material so thatevery individual
who hadthcopponunity tolook at it no
longer does. If they think they’re
attackingus, lhey’rcmistaken. They‘re
hurting everyone."

The College Republicans have
alsohadconsidcrable troublewilh what
appears to them to be an inconsistency
within the adminisuadon on the appli-
cability ofrules. Parson explained that
he was instructedby AssistantDeanof
Student Affairs Oda Callison to re

move Republican candidate stickers
from the entmnces to residence halls.

Since [hose locations are com-
monly used by organizations for post-
ing items, Parson insisted on an expla~
nation, and was told variously at vari
ous times that tlte placing of political
stickers violated the college's tax code
exemption clause and that they were
hard 10 remove.

Parson declined to remove them,
and said that he would personally take
care of their clean removal after the
election. This was not sufficient, he
said.

The College Republicans took
their case to Dean of Student Affairs
Thomas Clady who clarified for them
that the stickers do not violate the tax
rules and that there is no legal grounds
for denying them the plivilege of put-
Ling them up.

That was not the end of the prob-
lem. however. Wednesday morning,
according to Parson. two members of

the Collcge Republicans confronted a
resident advisor who was rcmovin g a
sign advertising Wednesday night’s
Oxford Union Debate between the
College Republicans and the Campus
Democrats from the doorway into
Langan Hall. The sign was posted
using a pro»Republican sticker as an
adhesive. The RA reportedly claimed
to have instructions from the Student
Affairs ofﬁce to take down signs held
up by Republican stickers. Other
sources were unavailable forcommcnt
on this incideanutLthcarletchlttck
will attempt to follow it up in next
week’s edition.

Parson warns that if people con-
tinue to lodge frivolous complaints
about signs and stickers and if people
continue to disrespect the rightof free
speech,lhen dliscampuswillsufferthe
imposition of very strict rules on ad-
vertising and communication, “and
no group wants that.“

an effort to make young kids relate to
college students as people to people
and we’re already beginning to see a
difference," she said.

At this point, I spoke on behalf of
the S 8t B and I expressed the view
that the newspaper had supported
through the article “Townles: the
Myth and Beyond“ in our first issue.
To this end, I pointed out that the
education of the young Grinnellians
should not be limited to warning the

kids about the consequences of ha»
rassingandassaultingcollegcpcoplc.
The very serious issues thatcause the
biggest part of the problem are
homophobiaandxenophobia. These
problems, along with that of the lack
of respect should be tackled by the
educational program to be initiated. I
was asked by the committee, to tum
in a copy of the article, for the
meetings records and forusc in Many
daynighl’smeetingoftheCityCoun»

AfterLheconclusionofthemcct

resentative, Nadcem Siddiqui said

that he was satisﬁed with the arrest
and prosecution of his assailants and
that he \vasalso Satisfied with the ﬁrst

problem. As mentioned earlier, the
issuewill been the agenda oftheCity
Council’s next meeting (Monday),
which theS&Bwaslnvited toattend.

It should be noted that the spirit
of Wednesday‘s meeting was very
cooperative and seemed rather prom-
ising. Let us hope that the same spirit
will prevail on Monday's meeting
and that we will have even better
news next week.
