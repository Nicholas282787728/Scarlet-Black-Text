Drake to Face
Creighton

Tough Battle Anticipated
at Omaha Saturday

OMAHA. Ncb.. Oct. 16 (Special)
ilt's too early for Santa Claus.
but the Creighton univeristy foot-
ball team would like to shove the
calendar ahead and'present Blue-
jay alumni with a Christmas pres-
ent in the form of a Homecoming
victory over Drake university next
Saturday atternoon ni the Creigh-
ton Stadium.

The Drake Bulldogs, however.
have a different idea. That's why
a ding-dong battle is in prospect,
Drake—Creighton games of previ-
ous years have always been tough
encounters. with Drake holding a
7 to 2 victory margin.

Both Teams Lost

Last Saturday Drake was
swamped by Ohio State while
Creighton held a powerful Rice
team to a 141mm: margin under a
boiling Texas sun at Houston.
But that comparison means noth»
ing to Coach Marchie Schwartz of
Creighton.

“Drake will be mighty tough
next Saturday," he said. and went
on to point out why. Last week the
Drake reserves took the heating
from Ohio State. Coach Vee Green
of the Des Moines school, realiz~
ing that his Bulldogs had no
chance to win from the mighty
Buckeyes. decided against running
the risk of injury to his first
string, and kept his reserves on
the firing line for almost all of
the game.

Muster Full Strength

As a consequence Drake's full
power has been preserved for
Creighton and other Missouri vale
ley opponents. That's why Coach
Schwartz refuses to be impressed
by the big score the Buckeyes
rolled up. and that's why he cxr
pects a gruelling contest from the
Bulldogs. who feel that they must
win this game to wipe out the
sting of the Ohio State defeat.

The game will feature the three-
day program of the annual Creighr
ton alumni Homecoming. Old
Bluejay grads. remembering that
Drake beat Creighton the past
two years. are clamoring for a
Bulldog scalp this year. and indi-
cations point to a record attend-
ance for any Homecoming game,
Faculty Manager Bongardt said.

Moore Began

(Continued from page 1)

After playing for several sea»
band to Chicago where he played
at the Hotel LaSalle Roof Garden
and later in the Lantern room or
the Drake hotel. while occupied
with this latter engagement, his
programs were broadcasted over
radio station GWN at Chicago.

Moore. in addition to leading the
orchestra. presents comedy skits
and impersonations. He has creat—
ed quite a following through his
hill»billy characters. whose conver-
sation forms me basis for much of
humorous dialogue.

Moore received fame recently as
the winner of a “hog calling“ con-
test for all radio announcers and
orchestra leaders sponsored by the
Radio Guide. He received a roa-
jority of the 4.000 votes polled by
the radio listeners.

Gates Annexes
Win Over Smith

Score in Last Minute Drive;
Dibble. Langah Tie

Gates annexed the only win so
far in the third round of the speed—
ball competition by defeating
Smith 675 Monday. while Langan
and Dibble battled to a draw in a
rough contest Tuesday. The re-
raining game in the third round
was played this afternoon between
Rawson and Clark halls.

Gates downed Smith. previously
undefeated. by means of a thrill-
ing last minute drive. Gates
trailed are going into the last pe~
riod. and then staged a determined
rush during \vhiCrl Bower and Mar-
tin scored field goals to score the
winning margin.

Dibble and Langan played a 5-5
tie in one of the roughest games
this season. A free kick by Bray
and two by Dean and a pass to
Weatherson gave Dibble a one-
point lead going into the final
quarter. Moehl tied the score for
Langan with a free kick in the
final 30 seconds and an extra pe
riod failed to break the deadlock.
