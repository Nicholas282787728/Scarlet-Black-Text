LOVIN CUP PRESENTED.

Cup Presented by Don H. Foster, to be
Contestcd for by Sophomores and

Freshmen.

Tlle chairman of tile Board of

Contlol recently received a lettel‘

trom Doll 11, Foster, ex-‘Oz, pre.
[\llllctlc‘
Mr. Foster declares in‘

senting a CLIP to the

Union.

tllis comrllunicatlon tllat he tear

hzes that those who talce part in
the annual sophomorelrreslnnan
meets have little to work for bill
glory and very little of tllat, and
there is need of some more ma
terial reward to arouse enthusiasm
and encourage hard work tor the

class meet.’ The cup is a beauty

and ought to bring every available
nlan into training for these con-

tests. The rules governing tlle

cup will probably be something
like this. to quote from the letter

ot presentation: "Tile class win.

ning the cup three times shall
have the ownelship otsame, and
it shall go to the trophy case, the
property of no particular individ
ual class. but in the name of the
individual class, either sophomore
or Freshman, that wins it. For
example. this year we will say,
the Freshman class, i905, wills it,
next year the Sophomore class.
{905, wins it.’ That would count
as a victory for each class, al-
though it was one individual class
which captured it each time. The
following two years we Will Say,
the next Freshmen classes, 1907
and 1908 win it so there are three
victories fortlle Freshmen and tile
cup goes to the trophy case with
the inscription that it was won by
the Freshmen classes. Tile vic-
tors shall, each spring that a meet
is held. have their class year enr
graved on tile cup in order to
keep the record positively cor.
rect." This interest shown by an
old student is very gratifying to
the members of the athletic union
and to all friends of the college.
This ﬁne cup ought to be received
in the spirit in which it is given
and should inspire men to get out
and train for the scarlet and
black. The time to get out is
right now, in order to prepare for
the spring meets,

 

 

 

 

 

 

AMPHION ORCHESTRA

THE HOME CONCERT,
Everttling points to a very suc , I
cesslltl concert. Already theseat
sale has been exceptionally large
and other indications show that
great interest is being taken, and
that the Colonial Theatre will be
crowded. Every year the glee
club and orchestra concert is an
imprirtdnt event looked forward
to with expectancy. Tile songs,
the Club, the occasion,are all lyph
cal oi college life. Nothing but
a football game or a ﬁeld meet
a r o it s c s the same enthusiasm
amongallthestudents. Professor
Cole organized both glee club and.
orchestra and brought both into
ﬁne condition alld it was thought
that without his presence the ill
terest taken in them would wane.
This, however, has not been the
case and both are fully up to the
average. Professor Matiack has
talten charge ot the orchestra and
Professor Smith the glec club.and
they have been very successtul in
keeping upa lively interest in both
organizations.
