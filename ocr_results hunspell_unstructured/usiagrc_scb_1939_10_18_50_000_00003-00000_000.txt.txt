Coeds ‘Disconcerted’ by Shivery
‘ WeeHour’ Trips to Loggia Phone

“Sorry The switchboard is
closed.” How many times hasI
your order for the White Spot or]
Cendyland (no adv.) been nipped
in the bud by these two words
sweetly spoken by "switch”? How
many times have you trotted
down the cold loggia or cloister
depending on whether your habi-
tat is quad or dorms, to the pay
phone that gives you “outside"?

In case you are one of the 750
students who can't understand the
meaning of the term, read on.‘
Now it can be told.

Switch, commonly known as
College Central, exists for the
benefit of the student body and
other persons, within limits. Said l
limits are 6:00 a. m., or whenever
the guys in the dorm kitchen
start playing telephonic bide-and—
seek, to one half hour after
”hours". In simpler languages, if
the quad closes at 10:50 p. in,
which it does, nine times out of
ten, the switchboard shuts down
at Lenrthlrty. But on week ends,
you can phone until twelve.

After that, people, you better
put your snowshoes on and trek
on down to the “outside" phone}
On account of when switch says
the board is closed, that's what
she means; your call won’t go
through.

Britt's/l Press’
Lindbergh Attack
Called Unjust

—By William C. Harris.—

If we are to believe the recent press
reports from Great Britain, the
glamour-boy of 1927, Charles A.
Lindbergh, has become America’s
No. 1 Nazi. .

The whole thing come about
when the Lone Eagle made a
speech the other day in which
he advised Canada to consider
her inmrests in the western
hemisphere before she went gai-
livnnting off to Europe to save
British plutoci-acy. It was his
idea that Canada, like the Unit-
ed stems, should be more con—
cerned with atiniis on this side
of the Atlantic than with the
continual hiekerlngs of the Old
World.

That 'thesis, plus his advocacy
of an embargo upon offensive
weapons, evidently sent all the
copy-writing John Bulls after ii—
quid nerve-restoratives,, for the
next morning’s editions blasted
away at Charles as udeveloping a
Hitler mind,” for “trying to split

the empire," and-for sundry other

crimes of equal seriousness. .

Amusing him of being “in
lore with Hitler-s armed might"
and sneering at that oi the
democracies, the English rags
charged the are pilot with de—
\‘eloping the- big-head after ’i’e-
calving a German medal last
year at the hands of Hermann

Guerlngi All in all, His Ma-
iosty's editoriniists made some-
thing very akin to the tainllias

striped kitty out of Minnesota’s
lair-haired boy.

The incident is not especially
important in itself; its real signi»
ficance lies in the fact that it is
but another example of the "hate-

Hitler” attitude that has com—
pletely seized Great Britain and
bids fair to make as complete a
sweep in the United states.

Already it has become near-
ireason to utter any words in
pro c oi the Nazis even though
those words miLy he the absolute
truth. Emotion has so far re-
plneed intelligence in the rea—
soning of most of our ardent
triends oi “democracy" that for
anyone to show the slightest
sympathy for the Germzin ob~
joctires is to court a barrage
at \erbzil rotten eggs.

This attitude is but a repetition
of that whir‘h prevailed in regard
to the German kniser twentyrfive
years ago. Of course, the foes of
Naznsm will not recognize this
parallel, for history has proved
the stupidity of that view. But
whether they recognize it or not,
the fact remains.

Neus Views holds no brief for
Charles Lindbergh as 2m indivi-
dual, but we do hold or brief
in the htlitude ot impartiality
which he represents. America’s
greatest danger in the European
war lies not in shipping muni—
tions but in allowing its natural
emotions to overwhelm its sense
or perspective. The bigotry and
intolerance represented in the
British attack on Lindbergh is
the same bigotry and intoler-
miee which is rapidly gaining
ground in the United states.
Combating this attitude wiu do
more to keep Ameiiea out of
tho, war than all the neutrality
acts on Capitol Hill.
