and your friends.

To The Graduating Class -

Next year when school opens, and the
general reception welcomes back everyone
to Grinnell, when the Pioneers kick off for
the first time, when the Thanksgiving for-
mal arrives, when the building and col-
lages throw the firsthouse parties of the
year, when your friends achieve success,
who will write all these happenings to you?

Obviously no one can keep you accur-
ately informed—[here is just one way to
keep in touch with every activily of your
friends and every happening at school—

The Scarlet and Black, delivered to
your door twice each week, will mean much
to you next year when you are away from.

When a representative of the Scarlet
and Black calls on you in the next week to
secure your subscription for next year give
him your home address and the paper will
be sent there next fall. From there we will
secure your correct address and you will re-
ceive every issue of next year’s Scarlet and
Black for two dollars.
