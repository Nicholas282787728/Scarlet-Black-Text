Intend to Get to Bottom.
"VI'e intend to get to the bottom
of this situation," Shelton L. Boat-
ty, dean of men, and official
spokesman for the administrative
committee declared yesterday in
announcing the action, “We are
not revealing any names, for we
fool that the men deserve anothcr
chance, but Grinnell is not a drink-
ing college, and we will not toier~
ate drinking on the campus."

Dean Beatty explained that the
action yesterday was part of a rc
statement of a general campus
policy. In all likelihood there
might bc no more expulsions, al-
though several other men ar-e face
ed with probation.

Send Lcttcrs Home.

"We are sending letters of ex-
planation home to the parents of
all the students concerned We‘
have been receiving letters of pros
tcst regarding drinking from inc
terestcd parents, and alumni who
of course expect Grinneii to main-
tain the satisfactory conditions or
life and study here," Mr, Beatty
stated.

“Those three students who were
suspended until June will be given
the opportunity of taking their ex-
aminations then. In addition they
will be given tho opportunity to
study at home in those courses in
which such study is possible. If
they do not complete their work
by June, they will be givcn an.
other opportunity tc complete their
work in September," according to
Mr. lscatty.

town men from voting, McMurray
said, ”we feel that there has been
double representation here, inase
much as the town men elect their
own representative to the Council
of House Presidents. The men
living in the dormitories do not
vote in this election, and it seems
only fair that the town men
shouldn't participate in the hall
elections."

Two ballots will be taken in the
voting for house presidents, ac-
cording to the rules approved by
the Council, The first ballot will
be for nominating purposes with
each man voting for one candidate.
The two candidates receiving the
highest number of votes will be
declared nominated for that office.

On the second ballot each man
