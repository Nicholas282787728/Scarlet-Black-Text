Drake Favored
in Dual Track

Session Friday

Return of Thomas in 440
Bolsters Prospects

of Pioneers

Both freshman and varsity squads
of Grinnell college and Drake univer—
sity will tangle in a dual track and
ﬁeld meet here Friday afternoon at
4 o‘clock. Coach G. Lester Duke of
the Pioneers intends to run a fresh-
man race after each varsity event,
while the mile and two mile events
will be run together

Present indications favor the Bull-
dogs to win the meet by a close mar-
gin, since they are strong in all
events. A trio of ﬁrst»clllss polevault-
ers, hansrud, Johnson, and Collins
will likely sweep that event, while
Harlan and Blanck are favored to
gain a majority of the points in the
shot and discus.

Polireuamc in Hurdles

Smith, star Drake dash man, is
likely to win those events, while
Thompson, Webb, and Duncan, MisV
souri Valley outdoor champion last
year, make a formidable trio of quar-
ter—milers, Van Lanningham won the
indoor half-mile conference championv
ship and is expected to break the meet
record of 2:00 3-10. Gordon has been
running both the half~mlle and the
mile, while Mooneyhan is the best of
the Bulldog two-milers. Podrebarac
in the hurdles and l-lyland, a sophos
more half-miler. should also account
for points.

The Grinnell outﬁt has been bols-
tered since the indoor season by the
return of Thomas. With the quarter
miler back in running shape, Murphy
has been working over the 880 dis—
tance and last week showed his heels
to home meet contenders with a 2:02
1am race. He may be able to cut this
down with Van Lanningham for com-
petition.

Mcnrath Improves

Mcllrath is now running the mile
and his 4:37 at Creighton last week
showed that he was on his way back
to form after showing a poor indoor
season. Pilbrow has been improving

Norton Speaks
of Oxford Life

English University System
Puts Responsibility
on Students

“Despite the fact that a great deal
or time seems to be spent in eating
and talking probably more actual
work is accomplished at Oxford than
at the average American university,”
said R. H. Norton, in his talk before
the Cosmopolitan club yesterday eve-
ning, Mr. Norton who is an instructor
in the history department spoke on
the government, teaching system,
athletics, and student life at Oxford.

The democracy of university gav-
crnment shows itself in the lack of a
board of trustees, Government is car-
ried on by the professors and the
graduate members of the university.

in discussing Oxford’s teaching
system Mr. Norton pointed out that
lectures were voluntary and a matter
of their worth and popular appeal.
The foundation is the tutorial system
which leaves the student entirely on
his own responsibility, Examinations,
which are taken only at the end of
the four years, test the Student’s
thinking ability and soundness of
judgment.

Athletics at Oxford are entirely
amateur. There are no coaches but
good upperclass athletes teach new-
comers Everyone plays games and
no one watches, The speaker pointed
out that it is necessary to- exer se
or else be overcome by the sleepiness
that the damp climate induces.

political science library of the late
Prof. A. v. Johnston are being ofr
fered for sale at the College Book

House Chairmen

Considering Plan
for Skating Rink

A plan for ﬂooding the tract just
south of Ward ﬁeld during the winter
and using it as a skating rink is be»
ing considered by the council of
house chairmen. At their last meet-
ing the members of the new council
were asked to investigate Some of the
rinks of other colleges and to decide
upon the possib ity of having one at
Grinnell.

Jesse L. Fellows, superintendent
of buildings and grounds, believes
this plan would be impracticable if
not impossible. However, since other
colleges have them, the council be-
lieves that a rink might be made here.

The site which would be used for
this purpose has recently been clear-
ed and will be used in the fall as a
practice ﬁeld for football. lts loca-
tion is convenient for residents of
both dormitories and quadrangle.

The usual method of preparing a
rink for icerskatlng is by ﬂooding the
ﬁeld a little at a time so that the ice
on the bottom is solid. In this way
the ground is not damaged by a layer
of water underneath the ice.

Recital F ricliay to Feature
