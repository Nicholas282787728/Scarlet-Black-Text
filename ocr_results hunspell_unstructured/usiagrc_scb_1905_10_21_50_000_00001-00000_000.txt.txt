with the city alumni, Grinnell will
have a good representation at the
game. The rains of the past week
hare made the Stadium ﬁeld a sea or
mud and water, and it was reported
last evening that‘the gameliad been
transierred to the East side ball park.
However, this could not be aubllenti»
eated and may possibly be onlydru»
moi. At any rate, the Drake manage.
ment will make every enortto have
the Stadium ﬁeld in shape, as this is
the most desirable place to play.
With a muddy ﬁeld, Drake would have
somewhat the advantage over the
lighter Grinnell players,

As to the outcome, both sides are
conﬁdent. although Drake has reason
to be more so. coaosh Huron said yes.

THE HUMBOLDT SOCIETY.

Last Wednesday evening the llum~
boltlt Society held its lirst on lol-
the year in the large lecture room oi
Blair llall. While the attendance was
noL unusually large, the paper was one
of special IilLei‘esL, It was a discussion
of “Practical Surveying,” by Prof.
Bucks or the department or Mathe-
matics. Tile paper included a briei
statement concerning the place u-illch
practical surveying has held in the
curriculum or Iona College, a compar-
ison or the methods or surveying em-
ployed in the East and West, an ac
count or the lioik or thecivii engineer
who surveyed lewd, adisoussiou or the
laws relative to Civil engineering.
The paper closed with a presentation
or the qualities which are to be desired
in a. man who does the work of a prace
tried] surveyor. Professor Buck's Iorty
years 01 experience in this sort of war
gave the address a personal navor
which made ltone of unusual interest.

In most states the colleges in their

Iowa ten year-s ago, these very moder-

An admission requirement oi two
