‘ ACTS “hich have conic to
light in the current canvm
oi Iowa College students by the
Athletic Union dues collector
seem to indicate that people still
remain ignorant of what is tncanl
when the subject is mentioned to
them. It the following paragraph
shall explain the menning of the
phrase “Athletic Union dues”
and incidentally call the attention
of a few people to [hair personal
obligation in the multel it “ill
have well scrved its purpose.

Front the very beginnings ot
her athletic cxtstence Iowa Col»
loge has been conironted truth a
persistent and troublesome (lift
ﬁculty, that ot providing ways
and means tor the proper mainte-
nance of sports, The bills for
Coaches, trainels, traveling axe
penses and supplies have {re
quently footed up to amounts
startlingly in excess oithe gate
rcciepts, Nor is this condition
nil-anticipated. The Union has
provided for such deﬁcits by de
manding rigidly irom every 3th
lete and soliciting earnestly from
every student the tribute of three
dollars per year. Evidently ii
this system met the hearty sup
port of even halt the _students the
Athletic Union would not long
remnin in its present indebted
condition. The fault not
with ﬁnancial policy but in the
student neglect olan obligation
which has been handed down to
each generation by its nrcdcces
sor.

The nalule the chlign
tion every body should know. ii
is the task of keeping the athletic
interests ot the collegs on a sound
ﬁnancial basis and to do this res
quires nothing more than a getter

either from the standpoint of the
