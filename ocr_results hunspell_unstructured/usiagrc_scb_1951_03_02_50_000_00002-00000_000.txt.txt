”it's only a twentieth the size

surprise Day wasn't the only
surpise in Loose basement on
Tuesday night. What was
thought to be n mole ambled
quietly into one of the rooms,
mosied across a sophomore's
foot, and made straight for a bed
where it remained a hermit for
the next fifteen minutes.

The animal was subjected to
various probings and coaxings
and finally with a broom was
induced into a waiting box. it
was carried upstairs into the
boudoir of Mrs. Leonard, Loose
hall houscmother, and when
duly introduced. not to break
any rules, was unceremoniously
deposited outside the building to
Shift for himself once again in
a cold, cruel world.

Two biology majors and a
zoology major were unsuccess-
ful in ascertaining whether or
not it was a plain male, or a
star-nosed mcle. However, an
economics major came to the
rescue and on hearing that it
was about a foot long, blinked
its eyes. and had a hairless tail,
decided this particular type of
mole, in proper circles is known
as :1 muskrat,

How it got there is still a
mystery.

Senior Drama Proieci

igus Sets for Summer Theater

The romant

Friday, March 2, 195|

zsounding words “summer theater” will have a

deeper meaning for 13 Grinnell College students next fall. Durin
lune, July and August, six girls, seven men and Mr. and Mrs. Ken
Andrews will eat, sleep and work theater at Lake OkobOJi

‘lt’s all a plan of Mr. Andrews
to give interested students fur-
ther experience in acting and
producing. During the eight
weeks, six plays will be present
ed. For her honors project. Doro-
thy Hume, Read senior, has de—
signed sets for three of the plays,
Angel Street, The Lady Who
Came to Stay, and pursuit of
Other plays to be
given are The Heiress, Blithe

-Spirit and The Late Christopher

Bean. All the plays have been
done here, but Dct's three are
ones she’s never seen.

Main problem in Dct's project
was the size of the stage to be
used. it is smaller than the ARI-I
stage and has neither backstage
nor wing area, Because of the
limited space, she paid no atten-
tion to the sets as given in the
scripts. Instead, she went over
the plays again and again to
weed out unnecessary props and
furniture. Almost all the furni—
ture and costumes now planned
are available here.

A course in directing proved
helpful to Dot, as she put the

‘techniques she had learned to

use. Mr. Andrews hopes to make
the theater entertaining. rather
than experimental and arty. Be-
cause of this, Dot has planned

realistic sets.

For her project, the dimunitive
senior made floor plans and ele-
vations, all drawn to scale. She
also did watercolor sketches in

lperspective and wrote a short
paper. Her main desire was to
give the impression of depth and
to catch the mood of the play in
her color schemes.

When the group goes to Oko-
hoii in June, everything needed
for the entire summer will have
to be taken. This will include six
’fireplaces, one for each play. For.
according to Dot. a fireplace is
one of the most noticeable props
on stage.

The men will head for Oka-
boji during spring vacation to
start on the old concrete garage
which will be known as the San-
ford Summer Theater. Mr. snd
Mrs. J. W. Sanford own the land
and the garage. and the theater
is being named in memory of
their son who was killed in an
accident.

Before production starts, an
entrance~way of stone block
must be built. The students will
also build stage and auditorium
lfloors and a proscenium arch.

The first two plays to be pre-
isented will be put in rehearsal
here. Then, after the entire
group goes \to Okoboii, they will
do construction in the morning,
have rehearsals in the afternoon
and present the play at night.
They will work.a six-day week,
being closed for dress rehearsal
on Monday night.

Plans are to live in an apart-
ment-type house where they will
do their own cooking.
