Grinnell Residents Like College

By Matt Harbur

survey of a small group of adult townsfolk indicates that
Acollege students are, in general, well percieved

mtxepolite. “I can’t imagine Grinnell without Grinnell College," he said “I enjoy
weirdness.”

Eben Eberhan '90, who was alsoat the Wine Cellar, pointed out that “people
get bad impressions of college students because of a few troublemakers.” Phelps
agreed and warned that ”college students need to understand that if they cany on as
ifthey were in New York City, or act like they own this place. they will be treated
difTerently. Being polite will get them a heck of a lot fanher."

Phelps added that “the college policy of not allowing young townsfolk into
collegeconcens is a big mistake. It does more to isolatecollege students and townie:
than anything else." He pointed out that thecollcge‘s cunent policy is achange from
the past. when young townsfolk were allowed into ooncens.

Dave Elliot. down at the Music Shop.sirnilar1y noted that students who come
toGlimlell from largecities areuntmsting and demanding. They also think thatlocal
prices are outrageous. He understood that moving from a large city to a small town
can be a bitofcullure shock and advised that students justrelax a little more. He slid.
though. that his dmlings with local students tended to be pleasant

Many Johnson. a bartender a1 Link's Tavern. said that he has always gouen
along with college students. He noted that they used to come into thatestabtishment
more often and guessed that the enforcement of drinking agepolicim in rocontyears
may havescarod themaway. Headdod thatnooneevergivescollegesutdents trouble
there. ”because if they do. they are out the door.”

Two other town residents pointed out other student behavior that tended to
distanoethem from townspeople. “I don'tundcrstand pigtailandean'ingsand all that
s—," said one older tnatc. ‘Thewomen arealways complaining about the mortand
then they goanddross like diem.” A“eonservnuve. family orien " woman in her
forties explained that “extreme displays tend to turn off more familyoriented
townspeople." She mentioned the "Penis Envy" collage displayed in the Forum
Gallery in 1990 as one example. She also noted that somestudents‘ appearance 7
for example, walking barefooted. or wearing “thin skins with nothirtg undenmth"
— slanted some townsfolk.

Both of these people. however, noted that they have“no ill feelings" towards
college students and that they were pleasant to work with. They condemned the
harassment of college students which has occurred in the past
