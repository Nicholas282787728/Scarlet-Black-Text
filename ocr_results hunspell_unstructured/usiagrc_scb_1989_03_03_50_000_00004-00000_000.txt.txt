China's historic statues

Standing ankle-deep in a
mixture of straw, mild, and
manure, we stared at the stone

on its beauty. The centuries-old
statue was certainly impressive.

was an important part of the

sacred path that led to a
nobleman's tomb, our professor
said. These massive statues,
about three meters in height,
were designed not only to glorify
the memory of the deceased but
also to protect the corpse from
evil spirits.

During the course of the
day, my classmates and I trnipsed
through recently harvested fields
and garbage-strewn lots in our
search for the statues, which were
made during the Southern
Dynasties period in the fifth and
sixth centuries AD.

China does not have enough
money to remove all its ancient
art works and put them into
museums, our professor
explained.

It was interesting to see the
tumbled-over statues, some face-
down in the mud, in the middle
of the brown fields. No other
evidence of the “sacred paths"
remained, and the tomb sites of
the long»dead nobility were
forgotten,

It was interesting and a little
humbling, too.

Fifth Force: classic hard rock

by Laura Moran

This Friday at 10 p.m the
campus band Fifth Force Will be
appearing in Hector’s. Consist-
ing of senior Mike Losh on bass,
guitar, vocals, and keyboards, jur
nior Jenny Jones on drums and
vocals, and sophomore Matt De-
Ceunynck on guitar, bass, and
keyboards. Fifth Force is a clas~
sic power trio.

The band originated with
Mike Losh in 1985. First
known as Slag, the group
changed its name to Disaster Area
in ‘86-87, with Jones originally
doing vocals but later moving to
include drums since the two pre-
vious drummers were, as she puts
it, “sacrificed to the god of ac
probe [academic probation]."

Fifth Force plays a variety of
late—'60s and early»'703 classic
rock covers, including songs by
bands such as Pink Floyd, Led
Zeppelin, Rush, and Iron Maiden.

“The four years that I’ve been
here, thcre‘s been reggae, synth-
pop, progressive and thrash
bands, but i haven’t heard hardly
any campus bands performtn g our
kind of music. I think we fill a
needed musical niche," says
Losh.

The band also spoke up in
praise of their special equipment,
pieced together by Losh, and of
their technician, Mike ”Poky"
Pokomy.

“Some of our songs would
sound pretty heinous without
Mike's technical genius at wiring

in the foot switch for the key- '

board Now we can play guitar
and keyboards at the same time,"
said DeCcunynck, the band’s
guitarist, whose three years of
experience with guitar sounds
like at least three times that.
Losh commented, “We've al-
ways wanted to stay as a trio, but

our fourth nleruber, Poky PokoV
my, our sound, lighting, and all-
stagc technician, is very impor-
lanl, It's nice to have someone
there to take care of spontaneous
problems."

“I’d have to say that without
Poky, our shows would be
technically impossible.” added
Jones.

Fifth Force has already ap-
peared twice on campus, once
first semester as the ﬁrst band in
the All-Campus Band Review,
and then last Saturday at
Younker's Night of Decadence
party.

Beverages for the party are
still being checked into by Losh,
but it is probable that a collecr
tion will be taken up in order to
pay for a keg or two to make
Fifth Force's classic hard rock
muSlC even more enjoyable.
