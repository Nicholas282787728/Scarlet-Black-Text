Mental health

orherwise have,

Finally, 1 would like ro address rhe lasr rriisree's
cornmenr. He asks wherher we needed ro eonrinue
ally rhrow money ar rhe residenre halls and menral
licalrh. Perhaps, sinee his eommenrs are raken out
ofconrcrr, he mighr have been sincerely asking a
oiicsrion, bur io me ii seems a rherorieil quesrioii_
arid rhar his answer ro rhar rherorical qiiesiion is
“no". Bur rhese problems are nor iieiv. They are
older and deeper rhnn rhe rriisrees recognize and
ignoring rhcm will nor make rheiri go away.

Paging rhrough rhe archives orrhe 5&3, a friend
ofmine found a column by Dan Rorhsrhild ’02,
which I believe was wrirren prior ro my arrival on
campio. Noring diar “Norbingivi t/7ira7/rlmn a m'lw
marrymli/erlr/rr Grimm/l Calbgt ': Rorhsehild nores
rhar “(he sysrems in place ro deal wirh people suf»
fering from all menial healrh problems, from mild
depression rosiiieidal rhoughrs, is lacking” and rhar
“it's no seerer among rhe srudenr body rhar self.
inﬂiered in yuries are nor uncommon."

Yer, despire Rorhschild's dire \vzrnlngiof
which funding shorrages eould well be one~lhe
adminisrmrion complerely lacks rhe manpower ro
efreerivelyeombar menral healrh problems on cam.
pus, a problem rhar became painfully apparenr lasr
semaﬂcn This rriisrees eommenr refieers a lsineerel
ignomncc as re rhe srare of rho adminisrrarion's
abiliry ro solve menral healrh problems on came
pus,

llack quamirarive dara r'o prove rhis poinr, bur
rhis rrusree should remember rhar even when rhe
majoriry of finals were made oprional and all re
sources were geared roward srudenr menial healili,
anorher srudenr wenr ahead and road so cake her
own life. This does nor prove rhar rhe answer ro
rhis rrusree's question is “yes,” for iris a complex
situation~bur rarher ir prova rhar rhe answer is
nor a definirive "no." The idea rhar effeerive dce
pression inrervenrions will aerually increase rhe
problem or depression on campus is nor only foulr
ish_ir is dangerous.

His (or her) quesrion should nor be so easily
dismissed. Nor only rhar. bur rhe changes rhar rhe
adminisrrarion has made re help combat menial
healrli issues on campus do nor seem ro have made
dieir way inro the peimanenr budger_currenrly,
addiiional menral healrh services on campus are
funded by rhe srudenr acriviry fund. And while ir
is rrue rhar rhe adminisiraiion should definirely
consider revising inrernal procedures as well ro deal
wirh rhis more emeiemly and erfecrively and rhar
while rhiowing moncy ar a problem doe nor nec-
essarily solve ir, funding is a coded componenr in
solving whar is unqiicsrionably a pressing and ur-
genr problem rhar Grinncll college srudenrs race

Again, 1 inviie rhe rriisrees who made rhe mmr

How could I nor applaud rhe reeenr renewal of

aswe are rhrowing around pipe

rliar would quire lirerally pur

Grinnell would lead colleges in
a race for new heighrs, and our
unique posirion as a small
school wirh a large endowmenr
will allow us ro finally rhrow a shadow on our peer
insrirurions. High caliber srudenrs would flee from
rhc shame of once—presugious colleges rliar would
suffer from a severe mounraimgap. Even
Middlebury, wish he much—boasred ski run, would
pale in comparison ro a college rhar eould hosr an
enrire winier Olympics.

Contrary to popular
belief, editors don't use
lift-out quotes simply to
ﬁll space. Their primary
purpose is to draw a
reader into an article.

As for proposals rhar call for improved srudenr

All weekend long, I babysat
A young, prospectiv: scudene

He rhoughr that impiudenr.

He said, “Uh, school and mi?
And I knew from rliar momenr on
My weekend would be rough.

i used my foolproofsrraregy

To rry ro break rhe roe;

“you’re sleeping on rhe ﬂoor,“ said 1.
“In case you have head lice."

1 showed ihe kid around campus,
And by “mmpus” i mean quad.
While l gor far offer?

He gor sick from bake'd serod.

“Tl-m suelo rhar you're nor feeling well,"
I remark’d as he boored

I asked him ifhe liked (a dance
And was shocked when he mid “no."
Isnld, “Folks don’r dance 0: Harris,

Ar Harris rhe prospic srood srill,
Qune unmoving, like a log,
And from die look upon his face
Youd rhink 1 char his dog.

“Fine, fuek it” I rhoughr ro myself.
“1 am rired of rhis shir.

This prospie.diide is on his own,
Tllar’x ir. It’s done, i dun."

I lefr my prospic standing share
And hop:'d my room he could find.

I slammed rwo beers and found my peers
And srarred to bump and grind.

Before i knew ir, ir was one
And she parry reached irs end.
Suddenly, i saw prospiodude
Leaving wirh my girlfriend!

Thar prospic-bastard ruin'd my life!
Things will never be rhe same!

He siole my one and only love,

i never learned his name
