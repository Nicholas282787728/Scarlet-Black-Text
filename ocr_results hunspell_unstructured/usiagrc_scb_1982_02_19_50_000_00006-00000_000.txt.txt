Ornaghi, Francesca

Besides winning the Grand Prize at the
Cannes Film Festival, The Tree of Wooden
Clogs has been universally acclaimed as
”one of the truly great films of our time; a
masterpiece of simplicity and eloquence."
Transcending facile class-consciousness
and sentimentality, it gets to the heart of
peasant life with subtlety, wit and vivid
description.

The story is simple and realistic in the
style of earlier nearrealist films, which it is
obviously indebted to. it concerns a group
of four or live peasant Iamiliesin 1898 who
work as sharecroppers on a plot of land
provided, along with a small house, stables
and some livestock, by their “master," in
return for twosthirds of their harvest The
peasants themselves own nothing so they
work in large groups. Throughout a winter
and the following spring several genera-

The ﬁlm opens with the parish priest
persuading the two main characters to
send their son to school. Later, when one of
the daughters gets married, she and her
husband go to Milan where they encounter
worker's strikes and military repression.
But these changes have a surprisingly
small effect on the characters themselves
Their lives remain much the same and it is
in the Ilux of daily life, intricately and
often randomly explored by the film, that
the true and important changes go on.

I must say again that this is not a film
just for sentimentalists and budding Manic
ists. it avoids, perhaps more by sincerity
than by design, the approach which, as
critic Andrew Sarris puts it, “consists of
idealizing the peasants in terms of the
sincerity and authenticity denied to us in-
escapably alienated city-dwellers." The
film's success in dealing unpatronizingly
with a subject we‘ve all seen become
maudlin and boring is perhaps a result or

Taking on is the iirst iilm that
Czechoslovakian Director Miles Foreman
made in the United States The ressures
of producing a protitmahin’g ‘li m‘ were
lessened under FDreman's low $85,000
budget, which therelore allowed him com-
plete artistic lreedom. Though the
dialogue is at times stilted twhich isn't
suprising since it isn't in Foreman's native
languaget, the beautilul images keep the
film flowing.

Briefly. the film is about surburban
parenm (Buck Henry and Lynn Carlini

gone to Greenwich Village for a rock audi»
lion During their search they end up
repairing their marriage. it deals with a
confusing generation gap, one between
