CHINA HELD BACK—

{Contlnued from PIE: One)

not as democratic a. measure as our
Munroe doctrine.
China Should Get Slliui'iulig.

He pointed out that Japan cmphu»
sized two requests at the peace con»
l‘erence alter the great uar. One was
the request for control or shantung,
and the other, joined in by Chlna, was
a request {or verbal acknowledgment
or the equality or the yellow race to
all others. This last was refused,
simply because the Asiatic races had
not as yet proved themselves by any
acts equal to the white race.

Speaking 01‘ the Sliantung question.
Prorcssor Hornheck made it clear
that lie disliked the idea or Shantuug
being given to Japan. with a popui
lotion or 32,000,000 and an area of
56,000 miles, and being populated by
purely Chinese people, with Chinese
interests and loyal to China, he could
not see the !aimes: of the unnexittion
to Japan. The only claim Japlm had
was that she had won it in conquest.

Professor Hornheck believed that
the entrance or Japan in the war on
the side or the allies, swung the pre-
nondemnce or power train the Central
powers to the side or the Allies. He
claims, however, tint the reason they
sided with Great Britain was to keep
Germany cut or Asia, morning one less
European power with control in are
Orient ,

Professor Hornheck will lecture 10A
night at 8 o'clock on the Near East.

(By Wallace Moore)

Judging merely lroni the game;
pluycd,aod the exhibitions put on by
each ball team, Building Six now looks
like the championship outﬁt in the
Dormitory baseball league. Doi mitorr
Eoui- trill have trouble getting out or
the cellar position. The ﬁrst tour 1):)-
sitions in the lcagne race will be in
doubt until the' last game is played.

But two weeks remain or the leagri
schedule. During the last two‘weeks
rainy weather causcd tour games to
be postponed, Buildings Two and
Three have been seen in action once.
and both clubs have two postponer’
games to play off. The other teams
are each one game behind in their
respective schedules.

Three, ﬂlltl 'l‘ii'o Strong,

Clark Hall lacks a strong hatterv,
and not having great strength in any
one position, is doped to rnd the
league schedule in ﬁrth position, info
lsaacson and “Chuck" Erwin are the
shining stars on Building Three's nine,

,wliicii club will probably give the Six

aggregation trouble. Clark, Ristllie
and Benz are by far the best players
or Dormitory Two, the team being a
fair aggregation as a. whole. Smith
Hall Incl-(s pitching strength. but has
n strong inﬁeld and only fair outﬁeld.
The SlX' are weakest in the hut-
rlolrl, strongest in the battery depart-

ment, and have an average inﬁeld.
