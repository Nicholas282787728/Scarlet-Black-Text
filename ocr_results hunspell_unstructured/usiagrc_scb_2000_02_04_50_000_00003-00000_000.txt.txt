Taiwan: 1 small tobacco-leaf shaped island,

China and Taiwan hovc an atypical pollrical re»
larionship. China vicws rhc island as part ofa unir
ﬁcd nation, butTaiwan views itselfas independent.
Any ourrighr stepsTaiwan has made toward inder
prndcncc have inevitably been overshadowed by rhc
mainland’s rcsponsc. a response somcrirncs accom-
panicd by missile lsunchcs or miliiary maneuvers
in the strait that scporarcs rhc rwo Countries.

Because of rho prccarious nature or rhis relar
rionship, Taiwan's presidential ciccrions rins mnrch,
a (hiccrway racc bcrwccn candidates wirlr varying

vicws ofindcpendence, promise ro bc imcrcsring
at [he very least.

Ar the last presidential ciccrion, “China had
military maneuvers .n rhc srrair, and rhe us. had
[0 send the scvcndi Fleet in,” said ProfessorWaync
Moycr. ”So rhc ciccrion is coming again, rhc Chi.
nesc arc vcry apprehensive. How much will rhc
mainland bc a threat?"

“Ifihings don’r go the way rhc mainland hope:
they’re going ro go," Prorcssor Scon Cook spccu—
lorcd, “irrhcy rcccivc, say, some sun orshirr toward
rhc [minoriry political party] that rhcy don’t find
favorable, you never know what kind ofaccion [rhc
Chincsc] are going to take.”

Thc dynsmic between Taiwan and China,
viewed wirh the March is ciccrions in mind, will
be rho nndcrlying rlicrnc oftlie symposium,

On Tucsdny, Chun-cliieh Huang, n professor
orlrisrory or National Univorsiry, will provide a his»
