The Grinnell Scarlet and Black. September 5, 1975—pl 8

Iampooned

(Ed. Note: Starting in this issue oi the 5&8 is, what i call, a revolving
column. This space will be filled periodically by the words of different
individuals commenting perceptively on some aspect of the vast world of
sports. With few exceptions, the writers will be Grinnellians, writing for
Grinnellians.

To get the column rolling I have condensed a rather provocative '

editorial concerning Women’s athletics from the July 15, 1975 issue of
National Collegiate Athletic Association News. The editorial discusses
women's athletics in a way that should interest even the most apathetic
sports fan.)

A major deterrent to a rational appraisal oi the development oi
women‘s intercollegiate athletics is the distracting contradictions which
continually emerge, These inconsistencies have been useful only in obs
tuscating the issues and frustrating constructive solutions. We comment
upon these contradictions here in the hope of gaining a clearer insight into
the strategies and motivations which are involved.

Much has been said of the undesirable commercialization of men's
athletics, and most of the women leaders of the past decade have said
time and again that women do not want to make “the same mistakes as
the men."

Yet, the leadership of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) Worked handrinrglove with the women lawyers of the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in writing Title IX
regulations which require equal recruiting and equal scholarships (with
minimum or no regard for the qualifications of the recipients). (Ed.
Note: Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 says that no one
shall discriminate, on the basis of sex, in operating any education
program or activity receiving Federal iinancial assistance)

The money to pay ior it? That will be the income generated by men’s
intercollegiate athletics, either from gate receipts or donated funds, or
from both. While decrying the undesirable aspects of incomecriented
men's intercollegiate athletics, the women, backed by Federal decree,
now demand thsir share of this tainted moneyiNOT their share of the
net, but of the GROSS receiptSVto finance the females in me style to
which they feel'they should become accustomed.

The Title IX regulations sweep aside the euphemistic term of “air
Iirmative action" to reveal the HEW pianners’ fascination with the quota
system Regardless of the quality of the women’s athletic teams, the
student body’s support ior those teams, the number oi tickets sports fans
buy to their events and the competitiveness ot the contestsiregardless of
all of this, the women's slice of the athletic dollar shall Be the same as the
men's.

All of this in the interest of integration and equality? Don’t believe it.
Flushed with its heady victory at HEW, the AIAwistimulated, guided
and financed by its parent holding company, the American Alliance for
Health, Physical Education dz Recreation (AAHPER)—continues to urge
its campus colleagues to insist upon segregation.

While ardently embracing Title IX regulations which presumably
demand the same treatment for men and women, the AAHFERrAIAW
policy leaders nevertheless demand separate coaches, separate athletic
directors, separate faculty representatives, separate eligibility rules and
separate administrative andlegislative bodies. Why not? If it doubles the
cost, the women aren’t concerned because they do not have to find the
dollars to pay the bills. They plan to live it up on big brother’s credit card.

From the man’s point of View, the most outrageous inconsistency is
probably the most iundamentai one, The AIAW leadership justifies all at
this by blaming men’s intercollegiate athletics ior suppressing them.
According to the women’s publicity front, it has been men who have in-
sisted that women be secondeclass citizens in the world of college
athletics, while the truth is that the women, themselves, have held back
the development of women's sports. For more than a decade, eiiorts to
Speed the development of women’s athletics consistently have been
rejected by the women’s leadership. _

Females discriminating against iemales, however, isn’t treated by the
law so the women’s strategy became clear~establish the oppressor
(men) and scream exploitation and discrimination, that's the way to get
the attention of the social engineers at HEW. It has proved a remarkably
successful strategy. ’ ‘ ‘

New field ready

Construction of the new football
facilities on the field directly north
of the tennis courts has been
completed, but a'lack of funds has
caused plans for several utilities to
be temporarily abandoned.
Restroom facilities and additional
parking space will not be part of

the current construction. The press .

newly built, and the scoreboard

instead oi purchased new The
original plans will be carried out
when money is obtainable. ‘Also
lacking are funds to tear down the
Ward Field stadium. That will cost
about $5,000.

One thousand permanent and
five hundred portable seats have
been installed. The permanent
seats were installed by Miracle
Recreation Equipment Co. and
BELG, The portable seats, which
will probably be used ior other
events in other parts oi the cam»
pus, were installed by Stadiums
Unlimited, Inc.

Director of Athletics, John
Pfitsch, said he thought the two
rival companies used the stadium
as a showcase [or their con
struction work and, therefore, did
extra good jobs. He added that he
thought the seating capacity of
1,500 would accomodate even the
largest crowd that might attend an
event there.

In addition to the seats, a
communication system will be
installed. This will include a public
address system and telephone
networks for both teams, but at
present this is still in the planning
