BASE BALL MANAGERS To MEET.

Next Friday there will be a
meeting at Iowa City of the base
ball managers of the stale college
league, Manager Dickinson now
has a provisional schedule for
next spring and after the ﬁnal
settlement of the league dates
Friday, it will be rapidly com.
pleted. Simpson College has ap
plied for admission to the league
and this matter will also come up
before the meeting at Iowa City.
Some of the schools are known to
favor the admission or Simpson
and this may be done although
there is opposition in
quarters.

Grinncli's prospects for base
ball are the brightest since 1899.
The schedule will be a very satis-
tactory one. as tar as now arranged
and the team promises to be
strong. Most of last year's men
will play again this year and there
is some very promising material
among the new candidates.

THE TORONTO CONVENTION.

Miss Anna Foster,of Smith Cole
lcge. spoke in the interest of the
Student Volunteer Movement at
the Chapel last Saturday evening,
Her special motive in visiting the
college was to secure delegates
for the quadrennial Student Vol-
unteer Convention which will be
held in Toronto. Ontario, from
February 28th to March 4th, This
gathering is held largely for the
purpose of interesting students in
the cause of missions and will be
attended by representatives from
many lands. It is estimated that
there will be between twenty eight
hundred and three thousand peo-
ple present. Low rates have been
secured on the railroads and flee
entertainment will be furnished by
the people of Toronto. A meet-
ing or the cabinets ot the v. M.
and Y. W. C. A, at which Miss

some

 

Foster was present. was held Suns
day afternoon to discuss the arlvis-
ability ot sending delegates to the
convention. It was unanimously
decided that Iowa College ought
to be represented, but no deﬁnite
action was taken. A committee
was appointed to solicit funds and
the appeal has been liberally res-
ponded to. so that Iowa College

will no doubt be represented.

ANNOUNCEMENTS lN PHILOSO-
Pay.

As it will be impossible for Miss
Millerd, owing to extra Work in
Greek. to offer any additional
courses in philosophy next semes-
ter. it is necessary to make some
changes in the announcement of
philosophical courses, l>rotessor
Boodin will give the post tniijor
in Grceit philosophy instead oi
Miss Millerd. This course may
be elected by a few students who
have good records in the minor
work, including the history' of
Greek philosophy. The electives
in Educational Psychology and
comparative Religion will not be
given. The omission of the forms

or course will be partly compenr
sated by taking up the relation of
psychology to education as one
of the topics in the advanced
course in psychology next semes-
ter. Other topics taken up in
this course will be llypnotism, tel-
epathy, spiritualism, insanity, etc.
This course is elective to those
who have made a fair record in
minor psychology. The hour tor
Casuistry will be arranged alter
meeting with the class.
