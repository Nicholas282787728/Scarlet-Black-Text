amendment to the constitution cover.
in; this very point and at the present‘
time the different state legislators are
engaged to passing upon this resolu-
tlon as provided in the constitution To
hear a discussion of such a question is
a privilege that should be taken ad»
vantage of. The dehates this year
have been unusually interesting and
this promises to he the best of them
all.

commencement week. With no col.
lege work, a pleasant round or ercnts
and programs of merit no student who
is in a position to stay if he cares to
can afford to miss the events of the
weeli. Those who lane stayed lor
this week in other years iiliniiohly lc»
