In Elizabethan Tragedy

Royal British guests received
a royal Grinnell welcome last
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
evenings. when Elizabeth The
Queen held court in ARH audi—
torium and gained new subjects
for herself.

A quality standardplaced high
in advance by a most ingenious
set and superlative costumeswas
largely maintained by a compe~
tent crew on stage.

This requirement w
to the inadequate racil

Curtis auditorium stage through theusei

, f l
Janeuor a stylized set composed o a‘changing the scenery kept the,

background or four classic arches
which became, through the in-
terchanging of simple, flexible
pieces, doors. walls, or windows
as required.

Costumes, while giving the ape
pearance of bulk, were scaled
down and simplilied iii a iiirther
effort to conserve space.

Joan iLandman sustained with
uiidcrstanding the "power of Eliz~
abeth through the excellently
written [inal scene,

Keith ‘Olsoll was an intrepid
and highly stubborn Essex whose

love of the fire was unfortunate-t

1y greater than his fear or being
burned. His sparring

,made the most of an apathetlcal»
ly written role, while
O'Brien plafyed Bacon Sincerely

The same sense of comedy that
made the speechless Sashka of
“Squaring The Circle" a stand-
out performance was again ap-
parent in Vernon Voyles' portrays
lal of the Fool. Jo MaeEachron
lwas highly decorative as Pene-

ibcamed broadly through one or
his Queen's most dramatic scenes
Saturday evening was one of tho
,iew unnecessarily amateur touchs
les. But on the whole, Ellzabeﬁl
‘and her noble friends acquitted
themselves like true royalty, and
,most of us were reluctant to leave
,her court.
