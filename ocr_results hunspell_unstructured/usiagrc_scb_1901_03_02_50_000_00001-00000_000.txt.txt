o

Iowa Wesleyan Given First
Place.

For the ﬁrst time in manyycals
has it happened that the enter--
taining college has won the Ora»
torical Contest. The Contest
was held at Mt. Pleasant Thurs-
day night and was won by C. M.
Cavenee, ilre representative oi

His oration, the title of which
was, “True Republicanism”, re
ceived ﬁrst place in both delivery,
thought and composition-

Second place was won by 0.
w. Stevenson or Upper Iowa who

 

omted on “The Triumph ol Na~
tronalism", while third place was
secured by Sidney cryoi- oi Coc,
who spoke on Benedict Arnold.

The contest was rousing from
start to ﬁnish,thc sound ofcollege
yells being silenced only during
the addresses of the orntors. Nor
did Grrnncll show any lack oi en-
thusiasm, in spite of the fact that
she had no orator and but low
delegates. With snclr vim and
spirit did they give their college
yells, that they were oiten aided
by a number of the other colleges.

Cavence will represent the state
at the Interstate contest which
is to beheld at Des Moincs, May
2, and now that the winner has
been decided rt is just that all the
colleges in the association sup.
port hinrin whatever way possi»
ble.

The banquet, which was held on
the evening before the contest,
was a thorough success in every
way. Mr. Risser, our representa
tive responded to a toast
“Freshmen” winch was very well
received. ,

At the business meeting which
was held Thursday. it was decid~
ed to hold the next contest at
Drake University. It was also
decided to hold the concert on

tofore,

Gymnasium Exhibition Most:
Successful.

The second annual gymnasium
exhibition was a most creditable
arrair. A record breaking crowd
was in attendance, the running
truck being iull and many ﬁnding
seats down stairs. As compared
with last year's exhibition a very
gratifying progress was evident,
not only in the numbers and en-
thusiasm of the spectators, but al-
so in the grace and skill oi the
pcriormcrs. The spectators came
early, a fair sized audience being
present at 7:30, and they kept
coming in increasing numbers till
a little after 8 when the exhibi~
rion began. Three judges, Di-
rector F. W. Barley oi iowa City,
Proi. Allen Johnson and Dr, P, .
Somers. marked the contestants
in event, those receiving
ﬁrst places to be given positions
on the Grlnnell Gymnasium
Team.

The contest was opened by
feats on the horizontal bar by
Thompson, Heald, Benson and
Harvey, the judges ranking them
in the order named. Next came
some evolutions on the rings by
Goldsworthy, Findlay and Marsh,
asa result of which Marsh was
given ﬁrst place and Goldsworthy
second. This was ionowed by
feats on the horse in which Chase
secured ﬁrst honors with Blather-
\Vlclt rind Burnside tied for second
place, Pa receivingthird. The
exhibition of tumbling resulted in
Wallescr securing ﬁrst place,
Findlay second, Marsh third. The
work on the parallel bars was by
tar the most pleasing ol the ap-
paratus work, all oi the move-
ments being oia high order and
well executed. The ﬁrst honors
were given to Parks, with Chase,
Heald and Blatherwick following
in order given.

The enthusiasm of the specta»
tors reached its climax during
the basket ball game between the
town and college teams. During
the ﬁrst icw minurcs oi the game
the town men seemed to be afraid
they mightdo something which
would not be quite right, or else
their natural difﬁdence was hard
to overcome, for they permitted

the college team to run up the

score oi s to o by a rapid success
