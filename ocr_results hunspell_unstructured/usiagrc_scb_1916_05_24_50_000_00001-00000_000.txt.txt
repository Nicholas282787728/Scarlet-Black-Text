"Chuck” Hoyt, by breaking the state
record in the 220 and tying that in the
century at Drake last Saturday, again
brought into prominence one oi the
greatest sprinters that Grinnell has
ever produced in "Speedy" Rushi
whose remrds have stood since 1897
until Couch Huff’s protege grabbed
the honors last week. '

7‘71th two slate records, one oi
which is still unsurpassed, and a long
series at State. Missouri valley, and
All—Western victories, "Speedy” Rush,
'97, was one oithe most brilliant stars
in the personnel of Gl'innell's athletes
oi: twenty years ago. Until the recent
advent of the indomitable l—loyt, the
state Meet records of this track vet»
crnn oi the nineties, in the hundred
and iwwmenty yard dashes, stood
uncontested. "siieedy‘s" tinie oi 9 4/5

in point which won the 7365

tannins "Speedy" acquired his great
est prominence in the memorable s
