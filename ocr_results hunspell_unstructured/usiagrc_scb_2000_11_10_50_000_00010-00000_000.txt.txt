Mars sues Earth

This week, i make fun of:
- Marrians
- Lawyers
- Basically every producr rhar has anyrhing ro do wirh Mars

PLANET EARTH; ln whar will no doubr riirn our ro be
die mosr publicized courr case in rhe solar sysiem since “The
people ofsarurn v. Ozmodnr." ihe planer Mars has ﬁled acIi-lssc
acrion laivsuir agaiiisr rhe people of Barrh. on behalfof rheir
enrire planer. Arrorncy General laiier Reno reporred rhar rhe
majoriry ofrlie UaSa'xScheduled federal rrials ivill be posrponed
indefinicely so make resources available ro derend rhe Barrh
againsr Marriaii prosecurors, Among rhe charges broughr by
rhe Marrians are copyrighr infringemenr, slander, breakingand
enrering, and lirrering. The Marcian panel of 17,469 lawyers
demands rhar pasr, presenr, and furore royalries be paid for all
“Mars" candy bars sold in she universe, and char “MdeM Mars"
pay Mais for rhe use ofrheir planer-s name, and demand rhar
Earrh acknowledge in she furure chac rhe inhabirancs of Mars
own exclusive righrs ro rho name ofrhe” planer. Likewise, rays
alries for Ray Bradbury’s Maw/m Chronic/er. pop psychologisr
John Gray‘s book Men are P147711 Mars, mom are From l/ennr,
rerro TV's My FooorrreMerrran, and Warner Brorhers carroons
fearuring Marvin rhe Marcian, would all be paid ro Mars in rhe
furure,

Anorher pan of rhe lawsuic demands rhar resrirurion be
paid for slander. The Marrians claim rhar movies such as Mr.
:iml in Mars and Mars Art/1:12: irreparably rarnish iheir planer's
repurarion. A lawyer for rhe ream handling rhe slander cases
said, “The slander charge acrually encompasses a wide range of
incidenrs. our repurarion in rhe galaxy was severely marred
when rhe ancienr Romans chose ro associare our planer wirh
their god orwnr. This Slander continues (0 (his day with rclcvlc
sion shows like Hemrlei: The Legendary journeys. The movie
Mari Amie/o is also} subiecr of rhis charge. Firsr, rhis movie
porrrayed us as evil,'violenr, perry, and siupid. Anorhcr prob
lem, however, was rhar rhis movie just sucked, and we are an.
gry ihai no one consulied us before associaring our names wirh
such an inferior producrﬂ

A rhird panel ofMarrian liiigarois is handling rhe break.
ingand enceringand lirrcr aspecisofrhe suir.The Marcians say
rhai, despire rheir besr efroro as keeping our rho “riffenﬂ‘” rhar

lying on rhe surface. They say rhar Earrh crash is ruining ilie
landscape, rhar rhey would like a couple people ihar owe come
muniry service anyway ro come over and pick up rheir planer.

The mere logisries ofrhis lawsuir are enough ro make one’s
head spin, Besides rhe lengrh and cost rhis rrial is sure re re»
quire, we musralso consider rhe locarion in which rlie physical
rrial will occur. The rrial cannor be held in Earth's armosphere,
considering rhar rhe Marrians are silicon.bascd amorphous blobs
rharshrivel up and eveiirually disinregrne when exposed re air.

The real Bill Clinton: the man from Hope and pop culture

Michael undersen

guest colummst

Did you know rhar George Bush's lasr name sorr ofrhymes
wiih "squish"? lr was roo beauriful a joke for a l2.year.olcl ro
pass up, So in 1992 when an obscure sourhern governor came
in rown, I made asign, raped ir ro the end ofa hikingsialf, and
packed ir inro rhc car ro show ir ofrar rhc Universiry ofToledo.
And so, wish rhe help ofrhe big fella, I enicred American poli-
ries.

Whar Kennedy was re my parenis, Bill Clinroi-i was ro
me, whecher I like ir or nor. ldidn’i have a goddamn clue vvhar
NAFTA was in 1992, bur my dad seemed ro like rhe guy, and
anyway, squish Bush. Sol kepr rraek. And when he won,
Clinron had annexed a polirical parry from Jesse Jackson and
begun his definirion of rho America ormy yourh.

Ofour youth? our folks claim Clinron as rheir own, firsr
in rheir class, and rhe rash of boomercwrltten rerrospecrives
thztwc’ll see in rhe next few monrhs will claim as much. Burl
wanr him for us. 1) Bill Clincon gers 43 percenc. 2) Wyn}
War/dintroduccs us all ro Queen. 3) Kurr Cobain sprays brains
all over his flannel. 4) The Simpsonr moves ro Sundays. 5) Some.

body else sprays guis all over 2pnc's jacket. 6) McGwireSosa
leapfrogs so or). Call me a male cliauvinisr or a guilry whiie
guy, bur I’ll veiirure ro say ihis was whar we’ll be keeping from
our reenage life, and Bill oversaw ir as much as anybody did,

For a few crirical years we saw him everywhere. Do you
remember? Ir wasn’r Ronny Reagan and ii cerrainly wasn’r
George Bush who srood up during independence Day and saved
us from ihe aliens with a Bill Pullman monologue, lr was Bill
clinion, rhe young, rhe orarorieal, rhc virile, as we all wished
him. He was lack Kennedy. He was Jack Ryan, He was Jack
Sranron. He was all we’d dreamed of. He was all roo human.

There were so many ofhim ihar rhc rrurh sroppcd marrer.
in .

g Forawhile, he was Don Juan de Marco. we wereMarlon
Brando ready for the rransfusion, lady ro feed offihe red blood
ofhis belicf. when we suddenly discovered char ir ms running
yellow.

Exacrly as we were old enough so nocice, che man siarced
so make misrakes. li didn'r marrer whar your policies were, ei.
rhcr. He berrayed his cerminal addicrions ro poscuring, vacil»
lacing, and deceiving. Healih care reform became welfare re.
forma He dropped inrerns on vernon Jordan and bombs on
Saraievo. And he lied ro us, of course.

lr was very srrange, because ii iiasn'r or all subrle. The
acquirial was barely over when rhe lowa siraw poll raised rlie
ciirrain on a young graychnlred moderarc wirh a crooked grin.
For a year, whenever rlic Bresidenr of rho Uiiired Srarcs made a
headline, Maureen Dowd would call him a hog. The youngesr
lame duck in a cenrury was reduced ro spliyiiig his legs on she
cover or men's magazines. Amidst self.conscious flailings or
narional monumenring and llaccid foreign policy, Bill cliiiron,
53, began living his life in she pasr icnse.

lrhink we’ll be lonely wuhour him. He didn'i know where
he was going bur we sure never did. As long as his economy
didn’t crash on us, which ir didn'r, rhc only infinirc sadness we
had ro share was warching MTv, working ar lc. Penney, and
maybe composing a hole graffiri. And occasionally shooring
each orher.

Evu'y gggenerarion geis ion in space, bur for us rime
was never rhe problem. So we slouehed in any direerion rhar
srruck our fancy and rhcrc was Bill clinron wandering around
wirh us. He was Odysseus so our Telemachus. He was Tom
lrwin ro our Claire Danes. semerimcs ir evcn looked like he
was leading.

I rhink rhere's a lirrle Bill Clinron in all ofus.
