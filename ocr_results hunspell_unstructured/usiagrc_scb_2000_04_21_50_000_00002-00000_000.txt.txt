A group orsymparheric srudenrs debated starring a gay/straighr

more people‘The group now has about 20 members, drawn mosrly
from rhe high school, our wirh a few members from rhe community.

Asian American, Native American, poor and

acted as commissioners, doling out permission
to build houses and churches, while two other
college students acred as sheriffs, policing rhe
neighborhood and throwing miscreants in “)ail” _ a corner in the
library.

In the first ten minutes, O’Connell ruled that thc Jewrsh
neighborhood's request to build a synagogue was "a little exclusive,"
and urged them to build a church as well. When a representative
from the Larino group asked for a request form, O’Connell spoke ro
her very slowly and clearly. “It needs to be in English," she said
“Do you have anyone who can ﬁll this our in English?"

Meanwhile, Lesh approved several regucsrs from rhe wealthy whire
neighborhood. “Maybe we should give them a rat break," he sug—
gesred, and O’Connell agreed.

Arrer rhe simulation, students broke up into small discussion
groups, each with a college student string as facilitator. one group
talked about class differences at GHS, anotlicr discussed niisunder-
sranding between college and high school srudenrs, and several groups
tackled homophobia

A number ofstudents said that discrimination couldn’t possibly
be as bad as the workshop organizers depicted ir, and a few said
Grinnell had no ptoblem with discrimination at all.

“It probably went over everybody’s head," said GH§ sophomore
Doug Guyer, “but at leasr rhey’ve been informed,"

Guyer said rhar rhe discussion groups did provide a sense oftlic
imporranee orbeing open—minded and “accepring what people are,
and for who rhey are."

Students had mixed reactions to the workshops. “Some said it

 

"The issue [of dlscussmg

“Archie Bunker’s Neighborhood" didn’r come to GHS without
some drama. A number or parents objected to rhe inclusion or
gays and lesbians as a minority group, and one reacher even report»
cdly rold a srudenr, “rhey are going ro make you act like a queer."

A common reaerion rrom parenrs was “My child shouldn’t be
learning diversity or rolerance, because rhen they'll come home
and challenge whar I say," Jellrey said,

“There's a genuine rear. Thais why people homeseliool ehil

Mostoftheobjectionsstemmed from a miss
undersranding otwhat rhe program was sup.
posed ro do, jeffrey said. Nonerheless, GHS
principal David Stoakcs asked )errrey and rhe
students to move gay and lesbian issues our of

placed by a Native American one,

“The issue is very complex," said GHS par-

Doorenbos said that including gays and les-,

sexual oricnrarion issues from rhe workshop, “1 think rhar was a
misrake," she said. "Part orrhe reason rhis was srarrcd was because
ofGLBT issues, and that should have been included."

Five years ago, she said, rhe same ser orworkshops ar GHS did

She charaererie'ed opponenrs orrhe GLBT neighborhood as a
small out loud minority," and said rhar most peoplewho had mics.
rions about the workshops wer simply unsure of the workshops
purpose. Once that was explained, Loparro said, objections were
less strong.

Between i0 and 20 srudenrs were excused rrom each Watk-
shop, Jerrrey said, our nor all of rhem were withdrawn by their
parenrs. A number orsriidenrs missed their workshop for rourine
reasons, such as a ﬁeld rrip or denral appoinrmenr,

Sonic srudenrs and parents "think that whar we’re doing here is
srupid, and what were doing is unnecessary,” Loparro said,
