A cold weather adventure to a thrift store

Adam Barrett ’08 shows readers that a feezing winter in Iowa is no match for the real adventurer

Greetings, adventurers! The weather has
taken a turn fol the gross. We've whipped out
the winter coats and heavier hats And though
we may still be desperately avoiding that day
when the scarves and snow boots come out of
that special box marked “goodbye forcvel, pie—
cious warmth of the sun," there is no denying
that it is no longer wrse to spread out in the
grass and be there, soaking up the elements.

Brit while we may not be up for longer- ex-
posures to the great outdoors, opportunities
still abound for adventurciindoor Criiliiell

One of my personal frlvoritc places to ads
venture indoors is that classic college student
staple, the thrift store. You've probably seen
Goodwill, hanging out right there on High-
way 146 and Harrison Avenue, several blocks
south or the College. But have you been to
Second Mile?

Head west on stir Avenue until you hit
Spring Street, then hang a left. As yotr cross

the railroad tracks, it appears on the right like a
blue and yellow vision. But thats no mirage—
it’s really there! This thrift store is twrce as
cheap as Goodwill and three times as charm»
ing. And, full of rreasiires.

Once inside, llCJd offlo the left a bit and
pick through the picture frames {or artirncrs
ofthose who've gone before. A friend of mine
once found this gcmidn embroidered scene
dcpicting one gunrtotlng human, a sootrtcr
be cyetleer, and a single
tree. Above this majestic
trio, in black block let—
ters, ﬂoated the words,

“A hunter will do ‘ANY—

TI-IING’ for a buck."

Archaeological scholars are still working to
unlock the layered meanings orthis mysterious
text.Who knows what puzzles it may solve?

When you're done pondering Americana
for the day, don't forget to peruse the racks of
clothing. In the wild world ofthe born advenr

turn, one never knows when a good disguise
will come in handy. What manner of escapes
will require that {either boa? When might
you need to lay low in a Grinnell Tigers ball
cap and .t gr-ccn neon balaclava? l have been
known to spend days incognito for no reason,
just in case,

For the indoor adventure of an entirely
different sort, go to Community Meal and sit
With a stranger, We at the college are cut off

from social contact with
anyone under 16 or over
22, and there's a lot to be
discovered in the experie
ences ofothers,

So go down to Davis 121*
cmcntaryﬁust walk down Broad Street, you’ll
see it evcntuallyyilt 5:30 p.m. on a Tuesday,
grab whatever buttery, meaty dish or vegetnr-
ran analog is on tap for the day, and strike up a
conversation. It turns out loads of cool people
are not actually college students. Who knew?

Taking an American flag sweater to Egypt

I‘ve been called many things over the years,
but I've never been called unpalriollcl Despite
its many faults, I’ve always maintained the
deepest fondness for America. I am incredibly
lucky that a kind providence willcd me into
existence on American soil.

And l don't take pains to hide my atteee
tron.

I have a sweater that I bought a number
of years ago, back in the first dark days of the
Bush era. This sweater is particularly dear to
me because i large Amer
ican ﬂag is emblazoned
prominently across the
front, broadcasting loudly
that the wearer is a proud
American. I‘m so attached
to this sweater—despite
its incorrect i‘rvc stars and six sll'ipcsitlmt
I decided to bring it along for my scmcstcr
abroad in Egypt And I didn't leave it in my
suitense when I got there.

I’d been in Cairo for a week, getting a feel
for the city and getting my bearings as best
I could. School hadn’t yet started and I was
making preparations tor my first day ofclasscs.
Egypt certainly doesn’t get as cold as Iowa,
but on otic cool February cvening, the wenthcr
was perfect for a sweatetil chose my favorite
one.
At best, this was a decision ofquestianable
wisdom.Atworst, itwas downright inﬂamma-
tory. In hindsight, it was probably closer to the
latter. But at the time I was completely oblivt
ious—I wondered why the otherwise hospie
table Egyptians were giving me cold states and
all the cabbics refused to yield.

I walked into a small stationary store to

 

buy a notebook for my Arabic class. I found
one suitablc tor my purposcs and brought it
to the teller to ask how much. She looked me
irt the cyc, looked down at my chest, and with
a grin, quoted me a price of 60 US. dollars.
I’d heard that Egyptians drove hard bargains
and many a westerner had been ripped off
due to a reluctance to haggle. I tried to negoti—
ate in my broken Arabic, but the old woman
wouldn't budge. She wouldn't accept a penny
less,I madc my way to thc door frustrated and
offendctliwalking past
a group of hughrng kids.
I really wanted that nOi’Cr
book
Later in the eve 'ng, I
met a friend at a cafe who
promptly complimented
me on my sweater i looked down or my chcsi
and it hit me like a ton of but I smiled
as I re. ‘zed what that old woman's grin hatl
meant]

Looking back, I think much worse could
have happened. 1 her there were a lot of
Cairencs iii the street that would have loved
to give the brazen American a frstful of their
mind.

It was a solemn reminder of how soiled
the American brand has become in the past
few years. A long war in Iraq, a disaster visited
upon its people, the unforgettable dishonor of
Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and complete
disregard for the world’s dissidcnt voices havc
aggregated to leave America in a precarious
place.

We roll our eyes when we hear ofAmcrica
referred to as “the beacon oflight" for the rest
of the world, but it used to be true. America

saved Europe from itsclttwice.and on (he see
ond occasion, we gave it thc resources to hold
off communism, rebuilding it with the MM,
shall Plan. After the Second World War we
didn’t grind our heels on the throats ofour err-
emies, rather, we were responsible stewards and
enabled our adversaries to prosper. Forty years
after the end ofWorld War II, we allowed the
Japanese and the Germans to emerge as our
major economic competitor-s. Such responsible
leadership is unprecedented in history.

Though we've squandered our unipolar
moment, America remains the leader of the
tree world, The oppressed, impoverished, and
disaffected masses have looked to America for
hope and to reaffirm thcir belict’ in mankind's
capabilities. Wt: still believe wholeheartedly

the ideals oflibcrty and justicc, and that all
men are created equal. Though we may have
momentarily lost our way, we have ledetl rented
ourselves to progress and emerged as the light
ful leaders of thc free ivoild. \Ve reaffirmed
American :Xceptionalism this year on Election
Day, and the world is better for it.

There is a great deal ofhope riding on the
shoulders of PresidentrElect Obama. Out
hopes must be tempered by a realistic view of
what he can accomplish. But I have no doubt
that our collective decision to move forward
again has rekindled a respect for America. It
will take a massive effort to reorient American
foreign policy, but we have the oppornrnity to
tchabilitatc the soiled American brand.

As for myself, I’m hopeful Wc havc the
world’s attention and we’re in a fantastic posir
tron to make the mostofrt. I certainly hope we
do because next time I go to Cairo, I’d like to
bring my sweater.
