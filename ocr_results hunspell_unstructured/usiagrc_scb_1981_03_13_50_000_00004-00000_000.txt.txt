Bur

by Kim MacDonald

Students returning to Burling Library
alter spring break may be a bit surpris»
ed by the sight of a tworstory carrell
tower at the east end of the main
reading room.

The Carrel] tower should resemble
die model currently on display in the
foyer case at the library. A somewhat
similar carrell system was a “great
hit" in the Williams College Library,
according to Assistant lerarian Steve
Pandolfo and the Grinnell experimental
tower is modeled after it.

The carrell tower, which can ac-
comodate 15 students, will beanother in
the series oi experimental carrells now
on display in the library These mock
up carrells are designed so that
students can use them and VDice their
opinions before the college goes ahead
on planned renovation. Pandolfo noted
situations where libraries have been
remodeled without student input and
students hated the results, This is one
reason die renovation stall is urging
students to use the new Carrells and fill
out the bright pink sheets available for
their comments,

There are presently two open carrells

JGA discusses”F"

by Bob Utkc

The state of the “F” grade was one of
several topics addressed at last
Wmday's Joint Board meeting. In
his report. SGA Vice-President Doug
Rowe announced that the proposal to
'l‘eilistate the “F" grade had passed the
Curriculum Committee (CC),

Aln'czt'gh the group passed the "F”
grade pmposal, no decision was reach-
cdasi when Hiedropdabeforcourses

for etude its the “F" grade will be
prescribed in either the Committee on
academic Standing or the All Faculty

mmittee. The proposal must 35
both bodies to be new ed. pa

Rowe had no insigh into when the

drop date for courses will be. He said,
however, that it was indicated that the
F“ grade would probably not take of»
feet until the i982<83 school year.
The Concerned Black Students (CBS)
came before .113 for funding for their
lack Martyrs Weekend and requested
5340. There was some debate over the
request in JB because the CBS receives
an annual budget from the college.
The representatives iui CBS
acknowledged that they could probably

handle the iunding lor this event out of
their budget. But it would mean
cancelling an event for later in the
year. JB was still hesitant and the re»
quested sum was amended to 5140.
There was still some question as to
whether the request would pass. Speak-
ing for CBS, Chris Johnson urged that

students and the library staff met with

number of ideas and Pandolfo said,
”We may do it again.”

The feature which elicited the most
repsonse is the round hole in die middle

students using the library on Wednesr
day may have noticed the rather
pungent odor pervading the building.
This smell was caused by the tar
machine which is being used to put a
new roof on the library. While the con»
struction company “is not guarantee-
ing anything," it is hoped that diis new,
twoply asphalt surface will not crack
as easily as the present one, A new
drainage system is also being added in
hopes oi staving off the flooding pro-
blems of two weeks ago. The library
stall is “easily frightened" by the
possibility of ilooding, according to
Pandolfo, and this new roof should pre-
vent it until a new rubber roof is put on
during the renovation.
