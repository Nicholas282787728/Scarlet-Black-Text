statement from the Lecture
Course Committee.

The end wltrclt the lectttre
course committee of the Y. M. C.
A. hare ever had in View in pre-
settling their various courses to
the students of the college and the
Cl us of Gl‘lnncll has been to
secure just as high class talent as
could be secured. and presenting
it at as lolv a rate as would in
sure the meeting of all ﬁnancial
obligatio iii other words. to ins
sure their coming out clear. Tlte
committee this year. although rec-
ogllizing the tact that the course
did not result successiuliy ltom a
ﬁnancial point oi view. [eel elitire~
ly satisﬁcd with the reception it
l'ccclvctl lroln thosc attending it.

The committee have talrcn the
attitude all along that the only
basis upon which to place the
course to insure its success. when
it depends upon the citizens of
Grinncll as well as the students
ior its support, is a co-opclative
one. Bearing this in mind, sug—
gestlons have always been and at:
ways will begladly received which
aim in any way at the improves
nicrit ot the method of carrying
on the course, or in the securing
of talent.

They feel highly gratiﬁed that
their errorts in securing a varied.
and consequently as instructive
a course, as possible. have been
appreciated. Also that their in-
novation in the method of secur-
ing seats has resulted so success
fully in having shortened consitlr
crably the time required in Cons
ductingasale.in becomingngreal
convenience to those who ﬁnd it
impossible or inconvenient to be
present at the sale. by insuring
them good seats, and in placing it
on an entirely equitable looting
for all. s

We recommend for the course
next year an increased patronage

 

which may enable the committee
of next year to plesclit equally as
high class lectures as have been
secured the past two ycnrs. And
we trust they may bl: successful
to such an extent that they may
be able
