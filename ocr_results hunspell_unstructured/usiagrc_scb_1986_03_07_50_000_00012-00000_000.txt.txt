Wick/Jam continued from p. 5

The rest of our stay in Xuzhou was spent
riding around on borrowed bicycles, tour-
ing a Buddhist temple, a park, a small
museum, and a ne h'ly opened excavation
site in a brick factory, where hundreds of
tiny stone soldiers had been discovered.
On Saturday night we ate dinner in a
restaurant at which the waitress told us
that our Visit was the second lime
foreigners had eaten there, and that we
were the first ones ever to eat on the first
floor. (Most large restauranmjn China
have two or more stories, with each higher
floor being less crowded, less noisy, and
more expensive than the one below it).

On Sunday, when we were preparing to
leave the town, Kate and I arrived at the
train station with a friend of a friend of Ker
jiu‘s brother, whom we had met that day
and at whose house we had been treated to
a feast of jiaozi (boiled dumplings) and
haijiu (also known as fire-water).

As soon as we arrived at the crowded
yard of the train station to wait for the rest
of our group, about fifty people gathered
closely around us. I began to speak to the
woman standing next to me. When other
people heard the foreigners speaking
Chinese, they became even more curious
and the crowd, which had now grown or
over a hundred people, began to press in on
us until the three of us were almost nose-
to-nose.

Our poor Chinese friend had never enter-
tained foreigners before and began to
panic, “We’ve got to keep moving! " he
said. So we began to walk around in circles
in front of the train station, but the crowd
only grew bigger and continued to follow
us. Finally our friend led us inside the
train station, where a PLA soldier barked
at the crowd to stay outside, and we joined
a new group of interested bystanders. This
time I kept my mouth shut, however, and
we avoided another scene.

A very different side of China unfolded
when I travelled with the CIEE group to
Beijing, whenever we were not touring the
Great Hall of the People, the Forbidden Ci~
ty, the Great Wall, and other well-known
tourist spots, we were free to visit some of
the many oases of Westernism m the city.

In one foreignrowned hotel my friends
and I discovered cheese and whole wheat
bread for sale, and saw such things as tuna
salad and cheeseburgers on one
restaurant’s menu. One night, two friends
and I took advantage of the rare opportuni-
ty to eat in a truly Western, very luxurious
restaurant: “Maxim’s-Beijing”, like the
one in Paris. Others of our group hit some
of Beijing's international crowd hangouts
(discos and bars), mostly in foreignowned
hotels.

Fortunately for me, Nanjing is not quite
the western home-away-from-home that
Beijing often can be. Perhaps the easiest
way to describe my day~to—day experience
in Nanjing is to say that it was somewhere
between my experiences in Xuzhou and
Beijing.

The point I am trying to make is that
China cannot be understood through
simplifications and exaggerations There
are two, three, or many more Chinas
within China and to know one of them is to
get only a glimpse at the whole.

piles of work to do or simply didn't feel like
going. I thought I would hurt them if I said
no. Thus, my roommate Ian had to help me
become comfortable declining such re-
quests.

“The most important thing in America is
to say ‘no’,” Ian said.

We went through such a rigorous pro
gram that I started to say ‘no’ to almost
everyone. I am sure he now found it
frustrating when I said ‘no’ to him.

I also had, and still have, a hard time
taking compliments smoothly. Just two
weeks ago, I was showing my friend Shelly
my newly finished resume. She said, “Oh,
it looks impressive!“ My response was,
“No, it is terrible,” even mough i thought
it was okay.

I was not trying to lie or be dishonest. I
was behaving fairly consistently with the
way i was taught, namely the Chinese no-
tion of modesty. For example, if you go to
dinner at someone’s house, you compli-
ment the host for Cooking a wonderful
meal. instead of “mank you”, it is very
likely that the host will say, “Nah, it’s no
good,”

This illustrates the Chinese notion of
modest never brag, but put yourself
down, This difference has gotten me into
various uncomfortable situations, not only
for me but also for the other people like
Shelly.

What is my response men to those who
Wonder about the adjustment to America
after China? I think there are certain
things that transcend national boundaries.
However, there are still many “little but
important" ﬁlings for me to adjust to. It is
friends like Shelly and ian who help make
the process easier for me. I Wish to pay
tribute to them here.

I often think of grandma who selflessly
allowed me to go thousands of miles away
to have this experience. especially when
they serve spaghetti in Quad. It is to her
that I dedicate this article!

Relays XIV
- from Meteorologist
virgil Ward

The vicious onslaught of February failed
to break us. We must now refortify our
trenches and prepare for rapidly advanc-
ing exams. We might find comfort in the
knowledge that spring will soon arrive to
strengthen our battlerweary morale. 0r
pray that the remaining week before our
temporary truce will pass peacefully. I,
however, prefer to quell my second
semester with the thought of a truck-load
of reinforcements due here on April 26,

RELAYS XIV seemingly eons away,
yes, yet we must prepare NOW to raise as
large an army of kegs as possible. To aid
this valiant recruiting effort, the Grinnell
Relays Committee has chosen to in»
augurate several fundraising activities
prior to spring break.

Tickets for the First Official Relays Raf»
fle are on sale now. For a more so cens per
ticket (or 3 for $1) you’ll have the oppor-
tunity to win dinner for two within the
sophisticated confines of J.D.’s
(Mnnn...imported beer-a perfect occasion
to begin training for those renowned Relay
events!!!) Contact any Relays Committee
member to purchase yours. Tickets will be
sold up until the rafﬂe drawing, which will
be held tomorrow, March 3 at the Campus
Band Concert in North Lounge. _

The Relays Committee will also sponsor
a bake sale today from 3,5 in the forum bet-
ween the North Lounge and the Grill. In
addition to good stuff to eat, raffle tickets
and the ﬁrst Iimitededition shipment of
Relay’s buttons will be available.

Your financial support is crucial to
secure the featured Relays beverage (and
it’s going to be back bigz). Creative talents
are also needed to insure and promote a
successful financial campaign. T-shirt
designs for Relays le should be submit-
ted by March 12 to box 6778. Artistic talent
will be rewarded financially and spirituals
ly. Designs should be normal on 8x10 paper
and in normal ink, but the design need not
be “normal"!

P,S, Beer is a beverage, not a projectile.

Outcry Letters

of the exhibit did not really look like vans
dalism. In fact, however, it was an ex»
tremely violent case of Vandalism. The
wire was part of an art exhibit, and its
violation is the violation of an artist‘s right
to express herself in a public forum, and to
give pleasure by doing so. Furthermore,
the wire represented people (“Whyare
People”). As the power of symbols in our
society is immense, the defacement of
these symbols — particularly the
calculated symbolic placement of die
figures mat the vandals undertook — was
a brutal and sick act of rape. The work of
art was raped; the figures in it were sym-
bolically raped; the gay community on
this campus was raped; and the rights and
feelings of all of us, gay and not gay, were
violently tread upon. In my mind, that is
vandalism. As in the case of the graffiti,
the perpetrators left no trace of dieir iden-
my 7 another unsigned “editorial,"

Another recent anti-homosexual state-
ment appeared in the latest issue of The
Outcry (p2). Although this editorial is on
signed too, it differs from the graffiti and
vandalism, because unsigned newspaper
editorials conventionally represent the
view of the entire paper. Thus The outcry
editorial, with its absurd, outrageous, and
highly destructive attempt to justify anti»
homosexual attitudes, is, by default, sign~
ed by Mr. Mclntire, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Macs
Cready.

Antihomosexual statements of several
kinds are being made here, They are
spoken: you hear it in the casual conversa-
tion in the dining halls, They are written:
you find it on the walls in Burling and
elsewhere. And they are made through
other forms of symbolism/vandalism
which are more destructive than whisper-
lugs and graffiti because they violate peo-
ple’s rights as well as making a statement.
I have only given one example of recent
anti-homosexual vandalism. I could cite
others. But the point that I want to focus on
is that, with the exception of The Outcry
editorial, all of these statements are uns
signed.

Let me ask of those who made the
statements 1 have just described:

Why don’t you identify yourselves?

What are you afraid of?

Whatever their motivition for these acts,
these people are the most cowardly l have
ever encountered (or not encountered, in
this case). It is obvious that they lack the
Conviction to come out of the closet and
back up their statements.

Notice that mis editorial is signed.

1 challenge those responsible for the
antirhomcsexual statements and acts to
write a response to this editorial. And to
sign it. Then we can talk.

—Jacob l-leringman

To turn to more mundane matters, we
have in our midsls . . , the Outcry. In their
last issue they once again made claims
that they are Christians, this time to de
fend their semiopposition to homosexuali-
ty. I’m not a Christian myself, but I could
have sworn that the basis of Christ’s
teaching is that we should love each other.
As in, “love your enemy," and “love your
neighbor as yourself." How does the need
to develop “nuclear war lighting
capabilities” square with loving your
enemy? Would Jesus be in favor of a US.
military build up? Or Was he with Elijah
on the beating of swords into plows issue.

The Outcry's article on birth control has
me confused. Surely that's a question that
a husband and wife can talk over between
themselves, Or is the staff of the Outcry
promoting pre-marital sex? Whoa hey,
fellas, that‘s got to be asking for at least a
little time in purgatory. You've got to
watch that kind of stuff.

Finally, the editors of the Outcry seemed
to be protesting something dealing with
the issues of apartheid. It is unclear
whether they were most concerned with
the character of the leadership of SEA, the
behavior of some members of SGA, the
holding of referendums, or the issue of
SGA contributions to the scholarship pro-
gram, One thing is clear from their “news
analysis,” they believe in making personal
contributions to good causes. Well, given
that you‘re all good Christians, lexpect to
see some generous personal checks rolling
into the South African Scholarship ac»
count, Can we put the two Todds down for
twenty dollars apiece? _p;,.,,,, cm"

Apathy

with 1986 an election year for many
states, the media has turned its attention
towards the upcoming races. Granted,
candidates have been campaigning since
the middle of 1991 but the arrival of the
new year brings the whole process of elec-
tions into full swing.

Considerable amounts of time, money,
and work will be spent trying to give can-
didates as much exposure as possible, yet
much of these resources will be spent in
vain. The number one reason — voter
apathy.

Why, in a nation with so many freedoms
and choices, does voter apathy exist? At
present, voting records indicate that only
slighdy more than 30 percent of the
nation’s eligible voter population actually
participates in national elections.

Even in countries, such as Russia, where
there is no choice, Hie voter turnout is at
least twice that of the States’, It would
seem then, after examining the voting
histories of other nations, that amount of
choice is not a significant factor in voter
turnout.

Perhaps, men, ignorance in the area of
political awareness is the cause. This lack

of awareness is illustrated by the polls con-
ducted by some of the leading magazines,
Such as Time and US. News and World
Report, which reveal how few Americans
can actually name the vice-president of
the 11.5.

Having identified one of the key factors
in voter apathy, now what do we do to
eliminate this lack of awareness? First,
educate the public. To do this we need to
start in the schools where our future
leaders and citizens begin their education.
Stepping up requirements for government
and civics classes would be one effective
method. Though some would argue that re
quired courses are not effective methods
of reaching young adults, but at least by
exposing them to this information, we are
supplying them with a minimal amount of
education needed. Also, making them
aware of their duties as citizens of the
United States further stresses the need for
them to exercise their voting rights.

As SGA elections approach, I tend to
wonder what percentage of Grinnell‘s stu-
dent body, traditionally known for its
political activism, will have the time to
become involved by making themselves
aware of the candidates and their plat-
forms. It is important for us to start here
and now so that we may become respon-
sibile citizens and leaders in the future, —
Margaret Litts
