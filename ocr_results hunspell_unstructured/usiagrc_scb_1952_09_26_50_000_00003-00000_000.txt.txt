THE SCARLET and Blacki
gridders have found themselves‘
. in the predicament they have‘
been trying their best to avoidi
all season. A potentially good
squad with only one game
played. the Grinnell eleven has
its back to the wall fighting
injuries and the answerless
problem of where to find ex-
perleneed replacements.

Injuries are not the only
problems that plague the Pio-
neers, for although they aren’t
flat on their backs. Grinnell’s
“walking cases" have not yet
fully recovered from playing so
minutes of rugged football
against the hard-charging Ko—
hawks last Saturday night.

Lawrence has everything
the Pioneers have not. The ‘
Blue and White will field a
team composed'of 11 letter-
men, four of whom are mem-
bers of last year's all-confer- i
ence team. But most important ,
as far as Grinnell is concern ,
ed, for every man on thel
field, Lawrence will have at ‘
least three on the bench, 12 i
of whom will also be return- ,
ing lettermen. l

Qrinnell will have to play no
minutes against a squad that lSi
not a two-platoon team, but
which can give its players a
rest now and then, and can re~
place any minor or serious in-
juries wi‘1h players and not tape.

Pfitsch puts it, ”You always
know what Lawrence is going
to do; the problem is trying to
stop them from doing it.“

All in all it looks like a
rough afternoon of football for
the Grinnell gridders. The Pio-
neers will rely on speed and
passing in their try for an up-
set. More important however is
the hope that the Grinnell first
string will be in good enough
shape to play so very full min-
utes of football.
