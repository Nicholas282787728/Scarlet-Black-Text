PAGE 12 THE GRINNELL SCARLET Ll BLACK MARCH 8, 1974

Mimer’s Madness hit me campus
several days ago as the Mime Tr-
oupe donned makeup and costumes
and interrupted their dress rehear»
sal to invade Hurling Library. As
they applied makerup, a running
commentary went on between the
members or the Mime Troupe and
their advrsor, Babe Voertman. '
“Lisa, you do my lines; you’re
an art major."

“I don't like Your nose." I don't
like Your face!”

”Your lines aren’t straight.” “Ye-
ah, but Picasso drew Straight lines,
and Inuit where it got him."

”Are we ready? Let's go antagr
onize some alumni."

“Are we going to annoy people
singularly or in groups?"

Upon arrival at the library, the
mlmes began to wreak havoc. Alter
starting a minor riot in one or the
aisles, the group (live menandthree
women) broke into the men’s bath-
room, shouting “Alright boys, put
those cigarettes out!" They per-
used their names on the walls can-
ﬁrming their status in the Grinn-
ell community, than skipped mere
rlly back to the Fine Arts building
to resume their rehearsal and “get
serious.”

The Mime Troupe was begun on
a wing and a prayer tour years
ago when Babe Voertman, eX-conr
tortionist for Lockheed Airs
crait lnc., experienced a mystical
Vision. Drawing together the cream
of mediocrity from the available
genepool, she transformed this mot-
ley crew or indentured servants into
a tightly knit ensemble devoted to
comedy, zanity, and inzanity.

Six major perlormances. three str
anding ovations, and one “thorough—
ly satisiying ﬂop" at Coe College.
Later, the Mime Troupe is set to
present its latest program, con-
sistlng or new material, old mat-
erial, postage and no handling. The
Show will occur next Friday andSa-
turday, March 15 and 16, at 7:30
pm. in ARH. The members or the
Troupe are Mark Anderson, John
Daugherty, David Gaines, Pam Gr-
eenblatl, Lisa Harris, Ann Kitch,
Brian Mann and Tom Simpson. As
the Mime Troupe Says, “We like
it, HE likes it, you’ll like lttoa!”
