Although the 1932 championship of
the Missouri Valley conference has
already been assured, the Creighton
university Bluejays may be forced to
the limit tonight to maintain their
undefeated record when the Crinneil
Pioneer cagers appear on the Omaha
floor for the season's final game.

Creighton showed exceptional pow-
er in handing the strong Marquette
aggregation a 51-22 trouncing Satur»
day night. The Pioneers were de-
feated 40 to 22 Monday by the Milg
waukeo team, which showed a come
plete reversal of form after ,its
Omaha appearance.

Three Seniors

Captain McCrcary, Don Rowe and
Paul Edman will hc playing their-
final game for Grinnell, Wolfe and
Christofferscn, reserves, will also don
uniforms for thc'lnst time, Maurice
Van Ackercn, Bluejay captain, and
Willie Worthing, reserve guard, will
close their careers as members of
the Creighton squad.

coach John C. Trucsdale will rely
on Frank Duncan and M on Frye
to keep the Pioneers in the running,
while Don Rowe, Dick Ullrich and
Captain McCi-eary will be faced with
the task of smothering Creighton's
lightning attack, Collin, van Ack-
cren, and Schmidt are among the
first five in Valley scorinr, CII'CICS.

nope Slight

In view of Monday night's perr
forniance, Coach Trucsdale has little
hope for a Crinncll victory tonight.
but all indications point to a close
cncounter.

The men who made the trip to
Omaha yesterday arc Ullrlch and
Duncan. juniors; McCreary, Rowe,
Edman, Christoffersen and Wolfe,
seniors, and Frye and Santi, soph—
oinores.

Gorychka, Budrunas

Lead Marquette

Scoring at will in the second half
while holding their opponents to a
meager total. Marquette university's
Golden Avalanche buried the Grinnell
Pioneers under a flurry of baskets to
win Monday night on the Grinnell
floor, 40-22.

It was a valiant scarlet and black
team, playing its last home game of
the season, that held the Hilltoppcrs
to a 20713 margin at thc end of the
first half, but the smaller team
could not maintain the killing pace
set by Coach Bill Chandler's men.

Goryr-hkii Leads

Adolph Goryclika, 190»poulld soph-
omore forward, and Walter (Wliitcyi
BIldruIlzlS, Six-foot~tllrce center, led
the invaders to victory, scoring 31 of
the to points between them. GoryCh~
ka played a flawless game, and
chalked up seven field goals and three
free throws for 17 points, while Buds
runas dropped in six baskets and a.
pair of free throws for a total of 14.
Marquette guards, Ronzani and Ship~
ley aided ther mates with some bits
of splcnrlirl teamwork. -

The Marquette team played a dif-
ferent brand of ball than against the
Creighton Blucjays Saturday night,
when it dropped a 5122 contest. Al-
though the Pioneers tied the score
four times during the first half, the
Hilltoppers got off to a good start
in the last period to pull far into the
