Sam. an only child. is eight years old. There are
no children his age to play with where he lives. For
him, staying by himseli is lonely. even though he's
pretty mature for his age. A lot oi the time he just
lies around watching TV. Sam is very bored too.

Angry. worried. upset, lonely. Children have all
these feelings at one lime or another But. strangely.
they hardly ever tell these leelings to their parents.
This is too bad. because telling ieellngs to someone

who loves you can make you ieel much, much
better.

Why It's :1 Mistake to Protect YourParentFrom
Knowing How You Feel

Children love their parents a lot. Even though
the parents may not know it. lheir kids feel sorry (or
them and worry about them too. Most children
know when their parents are in a bad mood. tired,
nervous. or sad. Children are like “detectives"
about parents' feelings.

Children also know that their parents are working
tor the money to pay bills and ior the enjoyment oi
doing a job well, This makes many kids ieel that
their anger. sadness, and worry about their parents'
working is wrong or bad. Many children won't say
they're upset about their parents’ absence because
they don't want to seem ungraieiul. Others think
that if they just can keep quiet. it will make their
parents feel better. Still other children are afraid
that their feelings could make a parent sick. or even
push a parent into a “nervous breakdown,"

Young people also have a way oi understanding
that their parents worry about them a lot too, One
child says: “I know my mom is always worrying
about me. so i don‘t tell her anything that would
upset her. i know she reels guilty about being away
while we’re alone ljust don't want to make her feel
worse." Another child feels that his father will think
he's a coward ii he tells him how he worries about
being kidnapped. So he says nothing.
