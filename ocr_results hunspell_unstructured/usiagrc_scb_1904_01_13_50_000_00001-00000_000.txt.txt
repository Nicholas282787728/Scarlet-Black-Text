good claim to the slate cham-
pionship. an honor which as is
universally admitted. will tail to
the winners of two of the three
games in the Iowa Grinneilseries.
It will be remembered that the
practice game of three weeks ago
was one by the Old Gold by a
score of 3935, ﬁgures that show
tltetwo teams to be in the same
class and give assurance that to
morrolv’s game will be won only
after the hardest kind of playing
of which botlt sides are capable
Iowa has the best team itt her
history and Grinnell's aggrega-
tion istlte strongest ottr college
has ever produced, although the
loss of Wilsonand Nareyasguaids
cannot bttt have its weakening ef-
fect on the strength of the Iowa
College team.

In all probability the men will
line up as ioilows:
