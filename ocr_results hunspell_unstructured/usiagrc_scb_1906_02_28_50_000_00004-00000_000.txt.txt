“EXAM" SYSTEM ADOPTED,

At a recent meeting of the faculty,
in was voted to abolish the drop sys»
tern or rather the last sad rites were
petroiinerl since tlle system has al-
ieady been abolished in actual pmc»
tlca for some time, and to substitute
a system of examinations. However,
this is not as great a change {tom the
present system as the mere announce-
ment would seem to imply. There is
great latitude given the instructors
and We may hope that under favorable
conditions “exams” will not. be any
more numerous than they are at pres-
ent, The committee in their recom-
mendations urged the change for the
reasons that it would ”secure greater
uniformity, greater deﬁniteness. ade-
quate time top examinations and non-
interference between courses."

The system in brief is that one hour
examinations may beheld at the close
Of the ninth week of the semester and

Week, provided the instructors so diet
It is optional and rests entirely

3 and 4. At the close of the semester
two one hour examinations will be
held in each course during the regular
recitation hours. The dates for this
semester are June ll, 5, 6 and 7. Un-
announced examinations, not exceed-
ing; two each semester, may he held at
such dates as instructors may pierer,
provided they (lo not occur Within one
week of dates set. apart for announced
examinations. Students absent must
take a ”make-up” and pay regular ice
unless excused by instructor. Exami-
nation is deﬁned, as any written test
covering more than the lesson assign-
ed for the day.
