able “isms” which are the bane of
laisseZ—iaire capitalism.

The Forbes article argues that the
coal industry, which had such high
hopes tor burgeoning into America’s
primary energy producer in the
1980’s, will have ditticuity staying
alive until then because of the en,
vironmentalists. Economic necess-
lty is being thwarted by “the power
of emotionaiism”. Without coal as
a signiﬁcant energy source, theU.S.
will have to import so much energy
that the balance or payments delicit
created will result in “serfdom”
{or the US, according to a spokes-
matt. Though the industry’s produc-

tion problems actually stem from
the l969 Mine and Safety Act rather
than environmentalism, the demand
for coal remains Slack, Why? Utils
ity companies are switching toluels
that are less polluting thanhighsul-
(or coal.

The industry’s answer isthatthere
are enormous reserves ollow Sulfer
coal in Western states just waiting
to be strip mined. The only prob»
lem with this is that people are be-
ginning to wake up to the devasta—
tion lett by strip mining. Some states
have legislation pending that will
regulate stripping. The narrow vic»
tory of Arch Moore of West Vir»
ginia over strip mining opponentlay
Rockefeller indicates that citizens
are beginning to realize the true cost
of stripping. But until all its costs
are properly assessed, it Will
remain cheaper than deep mining,

The attitude oi the coal industry
is explicit in the Forbes articles»
wait it out and things will get bet»
ter. Alter a iew power shortages,
people will want action last. One
utility spokesman said, ”We are
lacing a very serius tuel shortage
in 1975 unless the highssulfer coals
are allowed to be burned...” hours
alter we shut down power plants be»
cause we do not have the coniorming
fuels available, the politicians will
go to the public and say, “Look,
you have to choose between power
and the environment.” And the plants
will go back in serviceandthecoun-
try will be humming again." People
will simply opt for their energy. '

PACE intenhEcological Education

PACE (Poweshiek Association for
Conservation and Ecology) isa Grin-
ltell environmental group which was
organized last May. Headed by Ms.
Sally Moore, the group currently
has 62 individual memberships and
4 group memberships.

The group’s executive board meets
the second and fourth Wednesday
of each month at Saint Paul's Epis-
copal Church. The 7:30 pm. meeta
ings are open to anyone interested
in the groups work.

race is an action group, and is
planning specific activities ior the
near future. The group would like
to see the county and town acquire
more land tor parks, and will spon—
sor a tour early next spring to sea»
rch out possible sites.

Education is a prime objective of
the group, To help teachers in their
work, PACE would like to sponsor
scholarships {or conservation study

in Springbrook State Park.

A recycling committee is press
ing tor action lrom the city coun»
cil to establish a recycling program
{or the town somewhat like LEAP’S
program on the Campus. Statewide,
they are working to have a law
passed to prohibit the sale of nona
returnable bottles in Iowa. The law
would be similar to one that is now
in effect in Oregon.

PaCE’s zoning committee is work
ing for a county zoning law which
would control the placement or new
industry to avoid pollution of
streams and the waste ol good tarm
land.

Since race was just organized
last spring, it has spent most of
its time up to now getting organized
and is just beginning the action phase
or its work, However, the group did
carry on a number of projects dur-
ing the initial phase.

is subject to ﬂuctuations. How does
a utility company pass on the ﬂuc-
tuating cost of coal to Its customers
without specilic approval ota reg-
ulatory agency? The Iowa Southern

utilities Company does it by includ-
ing a clause in its regular rate
schedule allowing it to add on to a
customer’s bill an amount based on
the price at coal tor the month.
This means that the customer's bill
iS. (graduated rate times kilowatt

price oi coal times kilowatt hours).
in this way, Iowa Southern avoids
having to ask the lowa Commerce
Commission tor any rate change
whenever the price or coal lluctu»

Okomu: Educotton Serves Africa’s Needs

by Brent Schondelmeyer

Now a colleague among many cthis
former teachers, John Okumu
returns to Grinnell not in his pre»
vious Status of student, but as the
Heath Visiting Professor and
Scholar»in»Residence.

To this later title Okumu jokingly
remarked, “I don’t know what it
means. It probably means i am sup»
pose to sit around and hold, what do
you call them, rap sessions,”

Since his graduation lrom Grinnell
in 1962, there have been many phy—
sical changes. "The Forum is new
and it has Changed the social life
drastically, The new P.E. complex
has been a iine addition."

The changes are more than phy-
sical, though. “l've noticed a lot of
intellectual changes." Dr. Okumu
felt that the growing number of cour»
ses and course Combinations have
stimulated intellectual growth,

At Grinnell, Okumu became inter
ested in his field 0! studyupolitical
science. “I went to the University
of Nairobi before i came here. it
was an extension of the University
of London and there was much em-
phasis on the classics and very lit-
tle on the social sciences lmajored
in political science, as I tell thatl
would have all the political solutions
to the problems of Kenya. I think
I was mistaken in my assumption.”

Okumu pursued his interest in East
African politics while earning his
Ph.D. from the University at Cali-
fornia in 1966, His doctorial dis-
sertation was on "Kenya 1900-1930’
A Study in Conflict.” Since then he
has taught. at a number of African
universities and at Yale trom 1969;

Spirit 0r Spite: It’s Still a Splenolgio

by Gregg Daffner

For the past few months. the ad-
ministration at the urging ot cer-
tain Students, with noted Concern by
the Sch and with the belated de»
mands ol some parents, have incon»
junction with the All Campus Jud»
icial Council - investigated and ad»
judicated acts which allegedly vi-
olate “student rights”, and/or cause
damage to college property. These
acts ranged from threats oiphysi»
cal assault to setting fire alarms
on late at night. Some Students View»
ed these latter activities as good,
healthy, fun, while other screamed
bloody hell. Several students were
lined and put on probation, but the
word it that the vast majority of
oilende, s escaped unscathed.
Historically, Grinnell College has
a tradition which dates back to the
days at treshman prepping which
involved such innocuous activity as
{logging and later to the inimical
act at panty-raiding, etc Today,the
paddling or lreshmen, although
tondly remembered and devoutly de»
sired by many, is a tor-gotten art;
and with coed living panty»raids just
ain't what they used to be.

Today’s equivalence to panty raids
are: turning the electricity oil,
taking dining rooms apart, lood
lights, setting on tire alarms, etc.
Undoubtedly there were “prudish”
girls who wanted no part or the any
cient rituals, and likewise thereare
some diehard traditionalists who
still believe fire alarms were

intended as lire warnings. (The
change in the type olpranks may well
reflect the nature of today’s stu»
dents’ concept of tun, but that’s
another matter) Today’sjokes, how»
ever, have serious effects For ex-
ample, aside irom the question of a
student‘s right to sleep. em» undiS-
turbed, there is also the side ei-
iect of lack of response to the fire
alarms. Few students seriously ven-
ture out of the dorm when it is soun»
tied, and should there ever be a real
tire, we may be in store loraroast

There are, however, some impor»
tant distinctions in the kinds oi ac-
tivities in question. First, thereare
those which are intended to arouse
student (or other) harrassment.
These are the so—called pranks and
jags. Secondly, there are certain
activities, such as breaking turni-
ture, shooting out lights, and threats
ol violence, which are generally at
a more spontaneous nature and are
appreciated only by those commit»
ting the acts.

Whereas, most students agree that
the latter are impermissible activ-
ities, the status of the former is
questionable, The principle which
underlies each, however, is the
same. Some people think that they
can have ion at the expense oi ot-
hers, The problem is and always
has been, that the former, although
by no means innocent, are usually
intended in good fun, and are viewed

as teenage enthusiasm, while the

latter is thought of as downright
criminal.

Although the administration has
stood against both, lsuspect a dit—
ierent response. 1 can Just picture
an administrator telling if the stu»
dents who commit these pranks, and
then when he's alone, smilingat their
ingenuity and creative plans, think—
ing back to the old days when hewas
a lad.

ll this were a community in the
“outside” world, all suchacts would
be considered criminal But this is
not the “outside” world, and many
hold these actions as part of the
“Grinnell experience”, But so long
as part oi the community believes
such acts to be vindictive tantrums
by immature students » thesituation
may lead to vigilante retribution.

So long as the Grinnell students
are told that the College is a col»
lective social effort, where the
members are to join in “volunteer
activities contributing to the well»
being of the entire community”
("AS l See lt»»A view ct Grlnnell
Today”, Glenn Leggett) some stu—
dents will probably View these ac-
tivities as contributing to such a well»
being. Perhaps ilcommunal living
were not the points stressed, but
rather individual development and
individual rights (exclusively), there
would be little excuse [or the ”elu-
sive bursts or spirits during the
otherwise exceedingly hapless ear—
ly morning hours” (Rawson: AnSr

‘ wer,S&B Dec 1).

when you have a good group oi stu
dents. They help you in the process
ot writing. The two go very well
together.”

Okumu is currently working on the
completion at two manuscripts for
his forthcoming books on The Rise
and rail ot the Kenya People's Re-
public and The Comparative Foreign
Policy oi East Airican States.

in the ensuing discussion, Okumu
dealt with many otthe problems ot
East Airica,

“The development or Airican
nationalism has been detective. ,
We are operating at the point
America was in 1860 . There is
no local middle class providing a
base at Support.”

This was the reason tor the ex»
pluslon oi tcreigners in nearby
Uganda, “Kenya did the same thing
in 1958, but we didn’t do it on a
blanket basis. Under legislation cei-e
tain streets in urban areas were
solely tor Airican trade and all
aliens had to apply tor work per»
mits."

Okumu stresses the strong rela-
tionship between the economy and
political stability ”The prolit mo-
tive is what propels nations tor:
ward People currently in power

don’t have economic power. What
you must do is to establish an eco»
nomic base No country can be eco-
nomically independent it it can not
provide its own resources."

Education in Africa must meetthis
need, Okumu emphasized. “Our"
country has gone beyond the need
tor basic manpower, we now need
specialists. Our need is for man-
power development and resource a1»
location with the aim 0! replacing
foreigners with local people. The
curriculum in the social sciences
is geared for managerial and devel—
opmental roles to provide govern-
mental administrators."

Before coming to Grinnell, Okumu
completed a textbook on govern.
mental administration in Africa. He
commented, “The system is now
strong enough that you can study it.”

As tar as any personal political
aspirations, however, Okumu re-
marked, “l'm not the bureaucratic
type.“

Panic hours will begin at Bur-
ling Library Tuesday. From
then through the end or the
examination period, Burling
will be open until 1 am. This
includes Saturday, December
