Seeking justice through hiring

It is a basic philosophical question that seems to never
be resolved to everyone’s complete satisfaction: What is
justice'.7 Beginning last January, the trustees, administra-
tion. faculty and students of Grinnell College have been
faced with just this question in the College’s policy for hirr
ing for the Afro-American Literature position.

Ever since it was reported (5&3, Jan. 27, 1984) that Pro»
fessor James Kissane resigned as English Department
Chairman because, “I do not believe that qualified non-
minority candidates should, ipso facto, be excluded from
consideration, ” the issue has snowballed into an issue that
has hurt many people.

There is a vocal group of students who think it is just
and fair to award the position to the best qualified can-
didate available regardless of color, sex or other distinc-
tion. Their argument holds that the College should seek
excellence by hiring those people who, through their
academic accomplishments, have established themselves
as the most qualified.

Another group maintains that there is a Serious problem
here at Grinnell with the hiring of minorities and women
and that extraordinary measures should occasionally be
taken to assure that the problem is rectified. One extraor—
dinary measure in this instance means closing the posir
tion off to all non-minority candidates. This strategy is the
policy a written or unwritten 7 of the administration and
trustees.

Those in the first group sometimes say that just being
black does not make one better qualified to teach Afro»
American Literature. This is an excellent point: one need
not be medieval to teach medieval materials and one need
not be a conservative to teach supply-side economics. Un»
fortunately, those who insist on using this argument are
missing the crux of the problem/and are hiding behind a

When Chemistry profesor Rogers Gurira left the school
last year the administration could have held his job for
another black. They could have done the same when Lee
Cloud, a black music teacher, left last year. The fact that
Afro-American Literature is the position reserved for a
black is, of course, no coincidence, but let us not blow this
out of proportion.

Grinnell College needs more minority faculty members.
This is not based on attempts to appease anyone or rectify
social wrongs. It is based on the fact that the College
claims to seek diversity and is currently falling short of
this goal. It is not just the black students who are suffering
because of this, but the college community as a whole.

There are those who seek to do justice by putting on_

blinders and judging applicants on achievements alone.
We prefer that the College do as it is doing now: recognize
that a problem exists and urgently seek to correct it. That,
to us, is justice:

 

smokescreen of ignorance.

Grinngell’s Golden Security Force

by Paula Laiigguth

As a member or the campus
Security Force, and as an
organizer of an all-campus event.
I wish to bring to the attention of
the general public the ignorance
and irresponSlbility oi PreSldent
Matt Golden.

Speciiically. i wish to address
President Golden's views concer-
ning the Security Force as they
were stated in the 5&3 interview
with President Golden and Vice
president Mary Kosmidis.

When asked about the security
Force by the sen reporter. Presi-
dent Golden responded, “I worked
on security once, and guarded an
elevator. I wasn't impressed that
that was a wise allocation of
money". The party in question
where Golden "guarded an
elevator". was the Grinnell C017
lege Gay Community's tGCGcl
Valentine‘s Day Party As a
member oi GCGC, l was placed in
charge of obtaining Security for
the party from Bethe xeegan.

Allow me to clarity. for the
benefit of President Golden. that
the reason he was assigned to
guard the elevator leading to
Gardner lounge was one oi the
main reasons for having the

Security Force present in the iirst
place 7 to prevent vandalism.

The contract which grants stu-
dent organizations the use or
Gardner lounge for all-campus
events clearly states that all stalrr
ways and exits. other than the
stairway leading into Gardner
from the outstde. be blocked off.
This is done in an effort to thwart
vandalism in Main hall. and to
protect the organization which is
holding the event irom any liabili-
ty that would arise due to any
damage that might occur outside
of the immediate area of the par
ty.

The contract clearly states that
it it is discovered. at any time dur»

- ing the party. that the contract is

being breached (due to the {act
that the elevator and/or other eXr
its are not being properly barr
ricadedi, the organization holding
the party will lose its deposit.

it was for these reasons that
President Golden was assigned to
“guard an elevator”. Perhaps
President Golden indeed does
believe that he was guarding the
elevator i know for a tact that he
was “assigned" to guard the
elevator. but i. and the other
members or Security Force who

tlla‘l’s 43am:

were working at the time. would
tend to question whether Presi-
dent Golden actually "guarded an
elevator ”

in fact. 1 marvel that President
Golden can even remember that
he was working for the Security
Force on that particular evening
With the formidable picture of a
Security Force member that
President Golden portrayed that
evening, it is no wonder that
Kosmidls has the view that “peo-
ple who are working lor [the
Security Force] . . don't take it
Seriously."

The night ol the GCGC party.
Scott Preston. Todd Coulter, Ben
Johnston. and Matt Golden were
working Security President
Golden had conveniently found
the keg and was being paid money
by SGA to stand around and
socialize with friends and drink
beer The amount of people flow-
ing in and out ol the elevator
which President Golden was
"guarding” was only exceeded by
the amount of beer that was ﬂow,
ing in President Golden.

President Golden was asked
repeatedly by mysell. as well as
by the above mentioned Security
members, to guard the elevator
more securely. The reasoning was
explained to him at the time. but
has obviously been lorgotten since
then

When Bethe Keegan arrived at
the party, I confronted her with
President Golden's obkus State
of inebriation and lack of responr
sibility in carrying out his duties
as a Security Force member,
Bethe apologized and explained
that "he [Matti is a temporary
Security Force member. and is
working because the Security
Force is short on Workers {or the

evening".

Certainly, part of Ihe blame for

the lack ol good security can be

blamed on the small number oi -

people who are willing to take on
the responsibility tor seeing that
some semblance of order is main
tamed at allrcampus events; but
an even greater part or the blame
rests on those people who choose
to work on the Security Force.
knowing full well that they are not
responsible enough to handle the
job in a mature fashion.

It will please Kosmidis. and
many others. to know that Presi
dent Matt Golden no longer works
{or the Security Force. Assistant
Dean Oi Student Affairs Bob
Towner-Larson and Bethe Keegan
decided not to allow President
Golden to work for the Security
Force due to the fact that he had
1) demonstrated an extreme
amount or irresponsibility in per-
forming his duties. and 2) broken
a Security Force rule which
allows Security Force members to
have one or two beers when they
start their Shift and then the
members must drink water or
other NAB'S lnon-alcoholic
beverages).

The irresponsibility that was
demonstrated by President
Golden was exceeded only by his
ignorance which was revealed by
his obvious lailure to recognize
that he was and is directly respon-
sible ior much of the negative imr
age that the Security Force has
undeservingly acquired.

If President Golden cannot
behave responsibly in a position
where he is expected to protect
the interests oi a single hall and a
single organization. how can the
campus community expect him to
behave responsibly when he is in a
position where he is expected to
protect the interests or the entire
student body?
