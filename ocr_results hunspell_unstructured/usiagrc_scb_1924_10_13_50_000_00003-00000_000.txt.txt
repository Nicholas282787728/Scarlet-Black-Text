IT HAS BEEN REPORTED that a
dangerous gang of Apple thieves has
been operating in Poweshiell Cuunth
making away. with as many as seven
"apples" in one night. As we sit here
munching one or the forbidden {wit it

JOYS OF HIS

“By a Laborer."

WRITES 0F
PROFESSION

Saturday Evening
Post. >

Well, these are the main iccts about_
the American common laborer, as i
see them after fifteen years on sirtyv:
tthree jobs in a dozen suites. It is the,
!lite that gives the most freedom and
the least responsibility. I can do
work with my muscles that brings‘
me forty-five dollars a. week, and
while ! work, my thought may rave
about the world, for they are not hir—
ed by my employer; they are free. i
can feel a pride and physical pleasure
in the nerlcrmance of such work. I
‘enioythe comradeship oi unpretenti-
ous men. I prefer girls whonre happy in
a kitchen and who are glad to ride in ‘
a tllvvcr or trot out on a public dance
noon 1 like to sleep sound and eat
hearty. I like to live as tar as pos-
sible from the inﬂuence or the self—
anpolnlcd leaders, uplirters and sa-
viors or poor old humanity. i can,
come nearer finding the life I like as:
'a laborer than at‘any other occupa
xtion. And I plan to return to a coin»
moo lob. But shall 1’! 1 do not
know. It I were a walking dele-
gate or c throbbing radical 1 should
know everything. But as lt is I do not;
even know what I inn going to do.
