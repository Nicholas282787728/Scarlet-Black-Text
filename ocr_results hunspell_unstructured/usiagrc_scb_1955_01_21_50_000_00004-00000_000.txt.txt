Stringer in

By Chuck Slegmeir

Considering the exciting past
of this first ‘sttanger’ of the
new year, we couldn’t see at
first glance how he could set
tie into the placid atmosphere
of a small liberal arts college.
After looking around us howV
ever, and after reading the
front page of this week's 5&3,

we have decided that the at-,

mosphei-e is turbulent enough

even for him.

Radioing daily reports of
troop movements in enemy ter—
ritory is, of course, pretty risky
business when the country is
occupied by the limited forres
of an aggressor. But sending
these reports from the middle
of enemy homc territory
swarming with troops and
secret police is something on-
tirely different. Our ‘stranger’
calmly related how he, as an
agent of the o. s. s. in World
War 11, was parachuted with a
companion into the Austrian
alps and lived for several
months in and around, Innss
bruck, Austria, radioing mes-
sages to U. s. headquarters in
Rome daily.

With only an Austrian deser—
ter and a few members of the
resistance movement to help
them, he and his companion
were able. to remain concealed
from the German forces and ss
troops until shortly before
American forces of the 7th
Army entered Innsbruck on May
2. 1945. To emphasize the num-
ber of German forces in the
area, he pointed out that the
Germans were retreating at this
time on three fronts a before
American troops coming up
through ltaly and across France
and before Russian armies move
ing into Austria on the east —
and they were centraliiing for
a last stand in southern Germany
near Berchtesgaden _ less than
100 miles from lnnsbruok.

A short while before the
American forces reached Inns—
bruck, our ‘slranger‘ and his
companion captured the Gover—
nor of Tyrol and held him
captive as a hostage. They
forced him to declare lnnsbruck
an open city so that it would
not be bombed by Allied planes.
When the G1’s arrived, he and
his companion led them into
the city.

For his service in Austria,
our ‘strangel" received the U s.
Legion of Merit, the nation's
third highest citation, and was
awarded a Field Commission.

in order to receive the assign.
ment that he did, our stranger-
had to speak German fluently
rind French fairly well. His

early life and training provided
these qualifications with some
to spare. Born in Amsterdam.
Holland in 1922, he attended
grade and high school in Over-
veen, Holland‘until he came to
the United States in 1939,

Attending the Brooklyn Tech.
nical high school from 1939 till
his graduation in 1942, he held
a job as laboratory assistant
with Charles Pfizer and Com»
pany until the Army took him
in 1943. He also became a U. s
citizen in Texas this same year.
His army service ended in 1946
and he then went to Cornell
University in lthaca, N. Y. Also
in 1946. he and his wife, Eliza-
beth, were married.

Graduating from Cornell in
1949 with an A.B,, he went to
the University of Wisconsin
where he was awarded a PhD.
degree in 1952. After a year at
the University of Minnesota as
a PostsDoctorate Research Fel-
low. he came to Grinnell in
1953, as an ass’t Professor.
Now the father of a girl and
two boys, he has two other ins
terests to occupy his spare time.
One, an enjoyment and appre-
ciation of chess, has resulted in
his becoming sponsor of the
college Chess Club. The other
is an attachment to Hi-Fi music.
He also serves as Faculty Ad»
