‘ortliiieltl, Minn.

After a week‘s rest from their l'ﬂtllr
cr strenuous campaign last week, LIP
tle's squad at ball tosscrs hook tip
with Coo next Tuesday in‘ first
home game of the season. While coo
has a good ball team, the result or last
week's contest points toward a prob-
able yictory tor Ul‘lnllell, as the Cedar
Rapids aggregation was clearly cute
classed on their own diamond last
Saturday.

The local squad is working out daily
and are rounding into good lorm in
spite of the recent cold weather with
its ill citects on athletes. The brat;
ticc includes a live-inning grime each
altornoon between the regulars and
the \‘annrgztns, so that cvc voiie has
a chance to show what they can do in
a real game, Every man on tho squad
is meeting the ball consistcntly in
practice and judging lroiri Saturday's
cyliihilioii Gl‘lnllell is going to have :i

Macy seem niorc i'elid c than over

The [lllcht‘l's show no ill effects
from their uork last week and both
Augustine and Schultz are going gool

there is no doubt but that tlicy will
hurl a clits brand of bail. ‘\ glam

show that the Gliiiiiell team was nblc
to handle a wet ball with almost cr-
i-orless picc ion, so that little dill
