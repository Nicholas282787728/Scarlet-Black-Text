o. the tirst perlormauoc he
seemed to lack some of the
bmrnrn and athletic agility
that the evangelist role re-
quests.

But as the play developed he

it (zls a previous reviewer has

ways a little unable to help his
family when they needed him,
Nash’s play achieves a tender
pathos in the intimate domCsA
tic scenes. particularly when
Noah's inhuman rationalism has

altered the faint hopes of
Li ie, and it is in these scenes
that Koshkarian is ab his hope-
less best.

David Palmer plays the old-
er brother, Noah Curry. who
runs the farm on a strict
protit-nnd-loss basis and sees
humans as figures on the ac-
count. Noah is a character with
rigid, unimaginative and all
«most inhumn standards for
"seeing things as they are,“
In his philosophy there are
no dreams. no illusions 7 just
stcrk, ugly realities. Palmer's
portrayal ct Noah makes every-
lhing work to this end: a sus»
tained rigidity of expression and
posture and a sustained string-
ency and {lameness of elocu-
lion.

Somehow 1‘ wish he could
have made Noah a little more
human and tlexible while he
kept this quality of uncompro—
mising realism a more some
piex character driven by more
forces than the infernal logic
that Palmer developed so well.

performance seems a hille too

exuberant.

1. File, the sneritr plnyed by

1 Mike Burr, is d liardeliended,
embittered man who is iiually

l affected by the home spun in—
sight oi 11.0. and the basic
huinnnity of the Cllrrys. His

l deputy, played by Pete Kolev-

zon. is perhaps the most im-
distinctive chin-hotel- Nash has
put in his play.

The uneventful role is un-
deubtcdly among the most dif-
‘rreult to play in drama. Here‘
the difficulty is broadened by
lthe job-interview air that pre—
va s. Kolevzon was a little too
‘po to and stiff to make me
think he was really a deputy.

The outstanding success
amidst this casL ot good per.
formances s Barbara Hansen's
portrayal of Lizzie. Miss Han-
sen is an outstanding actress,
and the evidence for this exceb
lence is her ability to accommoe
date herself to a role which
=calls for happiness, sadness,
plainness (and its companionI
gloom) and beauty (and its com—
panion radiance) all in rapid
succession, She plays this role
with unusual and
feeling.

. Whatever criticisms i may
have ot this play are minor in
comparison to my overall feel-l
ing that this is fine acting and‘

able direction as well as a
charming two hours in Grin-
nell's intimate arcnn theatre.

In light of discussions I have1

ems-t. Whether you realize it or
not. the presence of unitorms
and military tunctlons on cam-
pus inllucnces attitudes.

The logic of tlic subwmi»
scious may he oversimplilicd
to say “Gi'innell is a good
school. Grinucll has ROTC,
Therelore ROTC is good and
Should be condoned and Sub-
ported."

When it is put in such over ‘

bold terms it appears ridiculous.
Some may argue that
promotes consciousness of the
military and keeps pcoplc con-
cerned about war and peace.
But what created the present
concern?

The proposal made by many

members of the group that has

expressed its disapproval of
the trend is that the present
ROTC program be discontinued.
in its place we would promise
that students who Wish to enter
the military take such courses as
geopolitics, communicationsstills

and methods, business adminis—

ROTC '

and management and
iother work covering the praetk
:cal aspects ot the current ROTC
program

Then between the student‘s
junior and senior years. he
would attend n summer train-
ing camp to get used to the
military lite and discipline. Ai-
ler graduation he would at.
tend an academy oi some sort
to receive the tormal parts of
I officer’s training.

! This

proposal would remove
lthc ROTC iron. the college enm—
lpus. thus eliminating the trou-
blcsome reaction to its pres<

encc.

It should be pointed out that
particular proposal would re-
the program for next year is
a start toward this. but this
quire o change .in the legal codc
governing the national ROTC
program.

Perhaps something can be

done along these lines next year.
