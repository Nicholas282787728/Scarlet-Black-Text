COMPREHENSIVE EXANHNATIONS

An educational experiment will receive its
first trial at Grinllcll this spring when members of
the . lliol- class will tulle comprehensive examin r
lions covering their major Subjects. These cxalliinar
tionS will entail the complete four-year course ill
the major subjects and, theoretically, will gi o tho
graduate a lunch more complctc understanding ol‘
thcsubjcct than he would obtain under tllc old sys-
tem of yearly examinations

Seniors will be excused from examinations in
other subjects, with the understanding that those
students with grades of I) in classes outside their
major course may take the filial examinations iii
those subjects, if they so desire, in order to raise
their grades.

It remains to be seen whether the experiment,
wl ich has been Successful in a fcw other schools,
\l'lll be as successful at Grinncll, For those whose
major courses constitulc their greatest intcrcsti
and these persons are in the majority—it. should
be. There are others. however, whose intcrcsts
lie in several courses, or in Subjoc in which ma-
jors are not offered. A comprehensive examination
over their major subjects will not benefit them as
lunch as those in the fi st group, but ill it should
involve no hardships. Aftcr all, despite the womb
of a liberal education as compared with specialized
training, it was entirely possible under tho old sys
tem to he graduated from a liberal arts collcgc
with a smattering of vague knowledge in numerous
scattered ficlds, and without a definite grasp on
any one subject. The comprehensive examinations
will combine a degree of specialization with a lib-
eral education

There has been some dissatisfaction voiced by
Several cliiors in regard to tllc . lection of the reg-
ular examination period for the comprehensive
tests. The faculty committee ill charge decided up
on that time, first, apparently, because it secmcd
logical that comprehensive examinations should
take place at the same time that regular final ex-
aminations are held; second, because if they were
to be held before that time, it was argued, Seniors
would have on their hands it great deal of: leisure
time which would not be put to profitable use;
third, because, with the comprehensivcs scheduled
late ill the spring and with seniors excused from
other examinations, more timc llla, be spent in rcr
viewing; and fourth, because approximately a wcclt
without classes will precede the examination for rc~
vicw put-pesos, and if the examination were held
earlier in the month, this study period would dis-
rupt class schedules

Sonic Seniors argue that if the comprchclisivc
examinations were to be scheduled earlier in May,
the lc lire time following the examination could be
utili cd for improving class work in other courses,
for doing lahorato , work, and for making ar-
rangements for jobs. They also maintain that if a
student till cd to pass the comprehensive examinae
tion early in May, he would have a cllancc to
”Cram” for a sccoild trial, but if he failed the ex
animation ncar commencement time, he would bo
hard pressed for time ili which to rcviow more ox-
tcnsivcly for a second attempt.

It might be well for the Senior class to hold a
meetiiigiattcndcd by more than usually Straggle
to cla s lllcctingsiwith the faculty committee, so
that ill all open forum such problems could be sctv
tlcd.

TIME FOR ACTION

The Student Council seems to have added it-
self to the list of defunct campus organizations, its
last meeting having been held several months ago.
The reason for i inactivity, according to its pr SA
idclit, is the lack of business which comes under
its supervision, according to its charter, and the
absurdity of holding meetings for more discus on
of trivial subjects.

If, however, student government is to be re-

Olhel Opinions

ARE WE FIDDLING‘?
(Daily Trojan)

If newspaper headlines and front page writevups are
fair indications of what the public is thinking about, the
American public is apparently fiddling while Rome
burns Public interest seems riveted upon gangster
stories and graft investigations to the exclusion of world
affairs and the problem of war and peace. And yet,
war is the biggest crime the world has ever known,
Gangsterism and graft are only petty crimes compared
with it. If the American public persists in neglecting
the problem of war, what part will it have played in the
drama of current world affairs according to history
when it is finally written? will it be Nero’s part7

While every responsible statesman has publicly and
solemnly warned the world that Europe is headed for
war, the American public still contends that we are not
interested in a European war and that if war comes
we will keep away from it. This is a sign of provincial»
ism and of profound ignorance of what modern war-
fare means to humanity, in the first place. war in Euro
ope will prove disastrous to us, and to all humanity,
whether we enter it or not, In the second place, we do
not even intend to keep out of the next war, otherwise
why are we building up our navy? Surely we do not
contemplate that some nation will cross the ocean and
try to attack us.

The truth is that America faces the next war with
closed eyes. We have not organized for peace, and the
worlds own peace machinery, such as it is, is fast
crumbling away. The analogy is similar to that of a city
which refuses to organize a fire department on the the-
ory that it will keep out of the next fire.

Patriotism and the warlike spirit are being stimu-
lated to the boiling point. According to Frank H. Sims
ond, the most powerful country on the European ccntln-
ent is in the hands of insane nationalists and mad rac-
ists. An armaments race and a new balance of power
conﬂict looms in Europe. In the face of all this, must
we conclude that the American public is only interested
in such questions as: what did Postmaster General Far.
ley say to cit-Postmaster General Brown, or, who fur-
nished the necktie with which Sankey hanged himself?
and What are the marital problems of members of the
moving picture colony? We will have to so conclude if
newspapers are correctly emphasizing items of public
interest.

AUSTRIAN MELODY 0F CHADS
(Dally Northwestorn)

Austria, upon which we have always looked as on
easy—going, goodvnatured. operetta nation, is today a
country of ruin, death, and deep hatreds, The mountain
yodeler, with his feathered cap and picturesque skirt
has abandoned yodeling for a rifle and a place in the
ranks of the Heimwehr. Going out to hunt socialists, to
hang them and torture them (New York Times, Feb.
20) is, perhaps more stimulating.

The city worker, on the other hand, has deserted
his fine, modern home and his master, the machine, for
the Safety of Vienna-s sewers. Those modern catacombs
may not emit aesthetic odors, but they are far less ob-
noxious than the gallows or the fascist inquisition.

As a result, Austria is topsy~turvey. Everyone is
out of his element. Country bumpkins which make up
the greatest portion of the Heimwehr, patrol city
streem, while the metropolitanite, who is at the same
time the socialist, flees from his habitual haunts.

And so the scene has changed, Our lovable musical
comedy romantic has shown his talent for other roles.
As a ruthless, cruel, bassosvillztin he has had a remark-
able success.

In the third act of a musical-comedy, however, the
villain always gets his just desserts. In this instance,
however, it appears as though he will be blessed with
the Third Reich,
