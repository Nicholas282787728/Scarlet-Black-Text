g juices in Grinnell's victory
over Drake. last Saturday even-
ing, and joins uitli‘ other ads
mirerx in doing honor to the play
ers. It is right that the entliur
siasm of the students should be
aroused by victories on the ath-
letic ﬁeld and that this enthusiasm
should be given expression The
manner of this expression how»
ever, should be wisely chosen,
We have fallen into the habit of
Celebrating bonﬁres and
similar means, all our victories,
small as well as great, without
any distinction whatever as to
their relative importance. A vic-
[Qty in a practice game, strclt as
the onejtist played with Drake,
calts for the same demonstration
that a vrctory in a ntatclt game,
such as the Thanksgiving game,
demands. With cthers, SCARLET
AND BLACK is inclined to believe
this unwise; that celebrations of
this kind should be ieservcti for
victories of real importance. But
whether this is the correct view or
not, there are two things in con-
nection with the last celebration
which are subject to strong crllir
cism. The time fur the cclebrzn

Two o'clock in the mainline. and

an opportune time torn demon~
stiation of this kind. The dese-
cration of the Sabbath and the
disturbance of the townspeople at
such an hour in the night. are to
be condemned. Objection is to
be made to the place of the Cole
bration as well. Two or three
year-s ago, it was understood that
all boil-ﬁres on the campus should
be held upon the old baseball diar
mond, Last spring and again
lastSuiiday morning this under
standing was violated and, asii

result, the beauty of the campus
is marred by two great hlotcltes.

ed. Those (lid this were
simply careicss. but the results of
their carelessness will be in evir

dence for many months. The
campus is one of more than
ordinary natural beauty, and
should receive proper treatment
from the students,

atternoou, and the large number
present attests the interest that is
taken in them. The exercises
went off smoothly and the pro
gram proved satisfactory. Some
disilppointn‘iel‘lt was iclt iii the
work of the cltoir, but because of
the lack of an opportunity for a
rehearsal, any criticism at this
time is hardly just. Tire talk by
Professor Main. upon the subject
of “Life” was one of the best tlle
present students have had the prie
vilege of hearing. These vesper
services are not to be meetings
tor the associations, or for thc
taculty or for any class or set of
students, but, as was said in
Chapel Friday morning, are to be
distinctively college meetings in
which all may share. The need of
a service of iliis kind is very
evident. and it is the hope of tire
committees in charge, to meet
this need in a way that will pro-
duce good result
