shirt into blue and white checkered

the emasculating chest hairs. pants
sensuously suck against bodies.
while drool falls down your face in
the mirror. staring at your beautiful
body. Strapping on the snug ﬁtting

dress. primping the hair in the mire

form shoes while looking forward to
the craziness of the night ahead. Feel»
ing the anticipation. the frenzy. the
fun, the campus is preparing for the
biggest party of the year

As we enter the disco daze. we are
entering “notjust an event." as Terry
Manson ‘97 described. but “a state
of mind." Manson is one of the disco
divas who call themselves “the Men
who stufftheir crotches." Leader and
silver cucumber bearer and wearer.
Alex Wood ‘97 proudly stated that
this year disco would be “bigger than
waltz." The anticipation for the big
gest party of the year could be seen
in Mariana Elder’s ‘99 smile as she
excitedly described her disco-wear:
“My dress is pink, obnoxious and
very short. I’m' going to wear gold
platform shoes, so I can strut a lot,“

This disco fever is not catching on
everywhere. however, as it seems the
more popular disco becomes. the
more contagious the anti»diseo feel-
ing ls. One student who wished to
remain anonymous announced her
belief that disco was designed to al-
low students “to get drunk and be
sleazy." She also called the ‘men who
stuff their crotches’ “a bunch of guys
who can‘t keep their penises in their
pants."

While the organizers of the event
did deny the truth of the penis com-
ment, they did not deny the fact that
pimping may very well accompany
the event and they are pleading
people to please “use some latex."
Accusations of the seemingly sexist
nature of disco forced crotch stuffer
Rupin Thakkar ‘97 to chime in that
disco is designed “to provide an ac-
curate historical description of the
disco era." Disco is all about forgets
ting the crazy beat of today and res
membering the funk and groove of

the yesteryeai.

The crotch stulTers wanted to also
emphastze that the dance was “pro-
viding a good service to the campus.”
Charity organizations such as Sec-
ond Mile have created a separate sec-
tion for disco clothes because oftliis
event. as it is has become one of their
biggest money earners In addition.
this year, organizers are attempting
to be environmentally sound by ins
stituting the disco recycling program.
Instead of students throwing away
their outfits, disco garb can be placed
in boxes by the dlntng halls on the
Sunday and Monday after the dance
This garb will then be stored by the
crotch stuffers until the next disco,
when it will be used to help students
in their clothing search. The party
will also bring together alumni with
students. and as Thakkar said, “It's
no coincidence that the alumni board
is meeting this weekend." Some of
the alumni may remember tlte ﬁrst
disco eight years ago .

According to Alex Wood. disco
started with a couple of guys who
were living in an offrcampus house
called Keg house. Apparently they
were kicked out of the house because
of an excessive fondness for parties.
After getting kicked out oi‘the house,

they dreamed otan event called ttiscu
which would unite the campus in the
common partying bond.

Eight years later the campus has
transformed disco into a dance that
has transcended even the campus to
include both alumni and the Grinnell
community. As Nick Lanna ‘99 said,
“it’s fun for both the lush and non-
lush audiences." Alex Wood fur-
thered Larma's thought, describing
how there are now “very few parties
that get some ofeveryone." like disco
can. However. the disco oftoday can
only happen if students are willing
to help out by doing such things as
shelling out a little money to buy a
disco t-shirt. This years organizers
are hoping students will buy more to
make the party this year even better.

A few changes this year to disco
will only build on the anticipation.
There will be a new updated dance
ﬂoor. a solo dance platform. and
many more lights than last year.
Asked if they were concerned that
students would drunkenly stumble
off of the dance platforms and hurt
themselves. crotch stuffer Ryan
Fenburg ‘97 answered that people
will “be drunk, they won't feel any
thing." Brut, the ofﬁcial fragrance of
the party. will provide the ﬁnal touch

 

Disco fashion fever seizes campus

“I’d love to see what the kids are
wearing.” a Bates Flowers employee
said as he beamed. remembering his
days as a disco doll who Wore the
typical ‘70's garb. When asked if he
still was a disco boy. he said, “I still
got all of those clothes; yeah, I got a
leisure suit. of course I got a leisure
suit.“ Bell bottoms. butterfly collars,
pale green, happy brown. platform
shoes. pink polyester, savvy satin 7
this panorama of colors and cloth
werepart of the 70's wear that enticed
and awakened discergoers' senses of
style and fashion. This weekend
disco will bring its colorful style to
campus and in true competitive
Grinnellian spirit will result in the
crowning of the disco fashion diva
late into the night on Saturday.

“I will be stylin' in my brown Leis
sure suit and polyester lcvis. Aside
from that I think crazy things are
going to happen to my hair ifI can
find any curlers," says Jamie Barden
‘97. Nick “da disco king" Lanna ‘99
said he is currently searching for that
look that is a “mix between kung fu
fighter and the macho man with a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cucumber." Another student de
scribed how his roommates pants
"are so light that a cucumber won't
ﬁt down there.”

The cucumber seems to have be
come the new accessory Ofcholce tor

disco. Asked whether the cucumber
ever gets cold and is physically de-
bilitating. cucumber wearer and
crotch siuffer Ryan Fenburg ‘97
commented that indeed. sometimes
“it's a bit chilly down there." While
cucumbers seem to add a twist to that
Brutrt'llled. liquor laden d:sco dance
floor, ittost students seem to shy
away from the long green vegetables

The two tnost popular places in
town that students go to for their
disco wardrobe are Second Mile and
the Rags to Riches conSignmcnt
shop. Debbie Smith. an employee of
the Rags to Riches consrgnmcnt
shop. described how they stock up
all year in preparation for disco.
When asked what the trends were for
disco fashion she said that the ole
tremely popular look "for men this
year is the pimp." She described her
excitement atsceiitg one student who
she helped suit up in a “brown leather
jackel and a red felt hat with a
feather." and how well he fit the pimp
role, The popular trend tor women
this year is away from the skirts and
more towards the bell bottoms and
pants. However, at Second Milt: I
talked With it volunteer who toltl me
how she had Just fit a “little skinny
girl into a little tiny dress and it tit
her to a T."

Ultimately, everyone has their own
opinion on which disco clothing and

attitude fits them What is the fuel
behind this rush for 705 fashion that
disco invariably inspires’lArl elderly
Second Mile volunteer described
how ultimately “you just do it be
cause it's the in thing, youjust do it
‘cause it's the in thing." Peer pres-
sure is a formidable force in the
world of fashion. but as one student
demonstrated there seems to also be
a capitalist influence,

“I’m going to be the tnoney man.
My shirt makes every hair on my
body stand on end," described capir
talist Warren Morrow ‘99. However.
while Morrow is the “money man"
the cost of disco clothes is very
cheap especially at Second Mile
where an outfit equipped With gold

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chains can be purchased for less than
liftccn dollars. Asked where many of
these outﬁts came front. both the
Second Mile volunteer and Rags to
Riches worker echoed cztch olhcr,
explaining that muclt of the clothing
was part oitlic estates ofthc recently
deceased, Debbie Smlth explaincti
how great it is that “you can recycle
everything." Ultimately. thc truth
about Grliinell's onermghtal'lttir with
the clothing of the 1970's was best
expressed by a anonymous groovy
women when she sliid, “And the cosr
turttes! Scary that people were those
things and: maybe scarier that wc'rc
emulating them,"

of70‘s disco dancing by ﬁlling l-lar-
ris wttlt its scent.

Awaiting the world otrhsco is al-
most unbcarablc for crotch stuffer
Sam Sellers ‘00, who described how
the anticipation has been giving him
goose bumps. He stressed that lie has
been awaiting disco sincehis drctnny
days as a prospective, citing the party
as one of his primary reason for ate
tending Grinnell. While ‘thc men
who stuff their crotches' and the
party they organize are constantly
changing. the atmosphere of the
dance is all about fun

Student Jamie Burden ‘97
accul‘rately captured the air oiexciler
tnetit when he said. “The enveloping
tantalizing sciit of sweet Brut. the
lamb-like chest hair, and the posslr
bility that our idol IT will be putting
in an cnlrancei yes. those are what
I am looking forward to the most."
This feeling of atmospheric arousal
that will sweep across the dance floor
on Saturday night Will leave no one
untouched. So. as everyone paSSlollr
