The comet came back '

The great comet that was seen by William
of Normandy returned to our skies in 1910
on' its eleventh visit since the Conquest.
Astronomers knew when it would appear,
and the exact Spot in the sky where it
would ﬁrst be visible.

Edmund Halley’s mathematical calcula—
tion of the great orbit of this 76—yea}r vis—
itor—his scientiﬁc proof that comets are
part of our solar system—was a brilliant
application of the then unpublished Prin-
cipia of his friend Sir Isaac Newton.

The laws of motion that Newton and
Halley proved to govern the movements
of a comet are used by scientists in the
Research Laboratories of the General Elec—
tric Company to determino the orbit of
eleétrons in vacuum tubes.
