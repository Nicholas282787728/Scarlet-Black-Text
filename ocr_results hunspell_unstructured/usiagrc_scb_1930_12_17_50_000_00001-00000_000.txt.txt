Sternfeld Announces Plans
for Three Exhibitions

in Quadrangle

Three art exhibitions will be held
in the. quadrangle next semester,
Miss Edith A. Sternfeld, assistant
professor of design and painting at
Crinnell, said today.

The ﬁrst exhibit, to be held the
last tun weeks of January, will be
a collection of watercolors especially
lassembled by the faculty of the Lay-
lton School of Art, Milwaukee, Wis.,
iwhere Miss Ste-rnfeld was formerly
‘a faculty member. In describing the
‘facillties which watercolor offers as
a medium, Miss Sternfeld says:

"Watercolor is a spontaneous mede
lium. A foresight of white space is
ldemanded of the artist, which may
:be largely neglected by the artist in
loils by means of scraping. Also,
white paper, the blank space, forms
las much or more of an integral part
of the picture as does the color."

Among those artists whose
work will be included in the ex ibis

five, together with a onerpoint de-
feat by the veteran Kansas >Aggie
quintet in the final 15 seconds of
play, have given Coach Mike Nyikos'
cagers the confidence necessary to
carry them through the heaviest
schedule ever attempted by a Billi-
ken quintet.

Onc Veteran Regular

With but one regular from last
year's sensational quintet remaining,
Nyikos has brought up two reserves
and with two sophomores has built
a team whose offensive and defensive
strength has been capably demon-
strated against its more veteran op<
ponents.

Capt. Les Hunt, regular guard last
year, and Les Roberts, reserve guard
of two seasons, have made the Billi-
kens' basket a hard mark to find,
while Frank Kennedy. a reserve last
year, coupled with Joe Kennedy, flashy
sophomore from Chicago, have shown
great promise in the early games.
Leo Grandone, lanky sophomore cen-
ter, has been the real star of the
team, leading his teammates in the
number of points scored.

This will probably be the regular

the season, with two sophomore
guards, Bob McCoole and Jerry Pad-
berg, ready to relieve the more ad
