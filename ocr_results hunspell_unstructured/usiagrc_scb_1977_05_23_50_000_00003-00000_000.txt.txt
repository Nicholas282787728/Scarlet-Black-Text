program The past iour years have
’iR’ought their share of memories
at will surface in altered fashion
as the years to come remove them
from the forefront of our minds.
Evolution has come to a sub
stantial part of the program and
with it a direction has been set for
the future of Grinnell athletics.

The college is obligated to oiier
intercollegiate and intramural
programs to meet the demands pi

e desiiing participation As

etic director John Pfitsch
made clear on television last week,
ior many students athletics are an

-gral part oi the educational
p ocess. There is much that the
individual may learn about him or
herself through the trials and
lribulations of athletics And when
you get right down to it. learning
about yourself is the function of
education

For those involved. the
philosophy behind Grinnell's
athletic program Sets them in a

‘ positive direction The competitive

Where athletics were previously
considered unfeminiiic, Grinnell

College is to meet the aforemenr

One of the unique joys of Grinnell
athletics is that everyone may

abilities outnumber the ex
ceptional individuals, In fact. a
sizeable proportion oi Grinnell
athletes have never competed

should be made to make every

Of serpents
and Maalox

by Susan Dujack

For years i have been wanting to
come forth with my smtement on
the “Grinnell Experience,” After
all everybody else has done it, so
why not me'! I’m now amazed how
people have managed to articulate
their impressions into a coherent
statement. This is my eleventh
drait. Ive already written about
how bad it was and how good it
was. I We considered how
meaningful it was and how pom
tless it has been. how much i grew
and how much I withered. Con-
vinced that any singular theme
would be either trite or a
misrepresentation, I have aban-
doned hope of leaving any
definitive words.

For the time being I‘m very glad
my college years are over. I hope I
never go through another such
period of loneliness, self-doubt and
hard work. I don't ever want to leel
like the walls are caving in on me
again. that I am a serpent among
humans or that I am walking
around in a glass bubble out DI
which no words can be heard I also
don‘t want to think about the
possibility that this hardrearned
education, instead of enhancing
niy tolerance ior diiiercnt types oi
people and opening new doors, has

more than ever separated me from
others and locked me into an
empty closet. These things i want
to forget.

0n the other hand (why |S there
always another hand?), 1 ap-
preciate having had the chance to
spend tour years discovering
hidden talents and capacities.
Amidst a rceking mass of
cigarette butts. coffee and lilaalox.
I discovered that i could stay up
three nights in a row and write a no
page paper between 10 pm. and
sunrise.

I have also begun to realize that,
contrary to what they told me in
high school, I do have a brain and I
am just as worthy or this world as
anyone else. That alone was worth
tour years oi insomina.

I am grateful to have had the
opportunity to spend days flirting,
with thoughts such as whether
there really are any such things as
objective iacts. From now on I
must assume that there are facts, I
will also never again be given
credit ior wondering ifother people
are real, or for that matter.
myself Outside an academic
community such talk is passed oil
as merely academic.

I will tuck all these thoughts into
my suitcase, pack the nightmares
away in the side pockets and
march bravely back East, unsure
of where I am going and a little
confused about what I have left.
