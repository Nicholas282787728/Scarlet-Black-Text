On The Contrary-u

That the men of Grinnell are resigned to
some, in fact many, of the changes precipi—
tated by the army of occupation, is a well-
known fact. The men are glad to cooperate.
But'there is one change that is entirely un-
neccessary, uncalled for, and, in our opinion,
a disgrace to the women of Grinnell.

The men are tired of hearing, “Don’t do
this, don’t do that, after all, this IS the
‘women’s dining room, the women‘s lounge,
the women’s everything.”

On the contrary, girls, it is NOT the woa
men’s dining room, the women’s drawing
room. It is the GRINNELL dining room,
drawing room, and campus.

The superior attitude of the women to-
ward the men, that is, treating us as if it
were a guest favor to eat with and look at
them, is most unappetizing. When we had

' the dorms we were only too glad to wel-
come you and you were very, very glad to
come over. Now we don't have the dorms
and you're on your high horse,

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

The men of Grinnell will do their best to
conform with your rules and regulations
to make for a better Grinnell society. But
remember, the men have given up more
than you will ever be required to; treat
them as guests, not doormats, if you please.

About Griping---

'A little honest griping is good for the soul.

Believing this firmly, the Scarlet and Black
editorial staff has not hesitated to comment
on campus conditions which seemed to re- -
quire remedy this year. Last Week We
printed a 'gripe editorial’ r 'ng the general
student view of the less efficient practices
in Grinnell college.

That very night one of the conditions was
remedied, and bread appeared on the quad,
rangle tables in whole slices,

But another result came out of that edlr
torial.

President Stevens has called to our at—
tention that faculty and administrative of-
ficers also have a few comments to make
on campus events. Thus for, these com-
ments have been restricted to mllrmurings
at faculty and committee meetings, even
as student comments have been heard mains
ly in bull sessions.

Dr. Stevens has suggested that such mur-
murs, both from faculty and students, he
put into a more tangible form.

For this purpose, the Scarlet and Black
staff announces the opening of its columns
for comments unconfined on subjects un»
restricted. It is our plan at present to run
the complaints, praises, or side remarks of
both bodies on Grinnell, students and facul-
ty, and let argument be free.

Perhaps we won‘t have to complain all
the time. We may even reach the point of
praising each other occasionally. But at
any rate, the issues will be open for any
comments, laudatory or caustic.

The importance of the old “Letters to
the Editor" column seems to have declined
in the past few years. But this is war, and
an alert opposition is supposedly desired.
So the medium for expression is hereby
opened, and let gripes be unrestricted.

With a few misguided characters
complaining about soldiers whistr
ling at them, we are reminded of
the quad resident who went dash-
ing to the dean's office to ask
that something be done about the
Pine Tree men. Seems that they
were forgetting to pull their
shades at night, and this girl
was worried because she could
see them from her window if she
stood on the radiator!

Julie Macy Started going steady
via telephone, and now Blanche

Tat Oxley only Wanted to be
uccomodutlng for some Company
“A" man and find dates for
three of his pals. Said pals: We
don’t want dates with college
girls; they're too young. Said
Tat: Well, I have two friends
that really look awfully mun-re.

We would never have thought
it of little Dickie Thommen. but
what do you Suppose he was up
to the other night‘when his date
came stumbling through the bot
gardens m such a state that
Lucia Cartel- offered her aid in

should secure the necessary
papers and get their physical
examinations at the earliest
possible date. ’I’hls does not ob»
llgste them in any way to enlist.
This may be done at any time
but certainly should be accom-
plished before the arrival of the
enlistment team."

.. . . . it is probable that the
schedule visit of the enlistment
team to your institution Will be
the only one made. Attention

must be accomplished by Dec. 31.

present themselves to the nearest
posslble permanent enlisting sta-
tion at their own expense."
