Bagels and the Jewish Experience

With the long-awaited arrival of the
real bagel on the Grinnell campus
comes a renewed attention w ﬁle C0l~
lege’s Jewish population. This popula—
tion sometimes appears to be much
larger than it actually is, especially to
those who had never met a Jew before
they came here and found themselves
surrounded by them. l hope this wasn’t
an unpleasant experience for these peo-
ple and that they were pleasantly sur-
prised to find that Jews do not have
horns after all tAnd it we did, they
wouldn’t be contagious, because
Judaism is not a missionary religion).

The size of the population is a matter
of opinion. It is (or was last year,
anyway) either approximately 35 per-
cent or eight percent of the total student
body, depending on how one looks at
things. It you are a Nazi, a member or
the PLO, or just a regular, 01’, ardent
antisemite. you will probably accept
the 35 percent figure. This is the percen~
tage of students oi Jewish heritage. The
eight percent is the percentage of
students who, when polled last year,
considered themselves Jewish. It is
also the percentage which attends only
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur (High
Holidays) services (hence the name
“two-daya-year Jews"). The percen-
tage of students which attends
Associated Jewish Students meetings
(about an hour a weekl regularly is
considerably lower » one to two per-
cent as a liberal guess.

Now, I’m not saying that i know that
the rest of the Jewish students do not
practice Judaism at all just because
they're not at AJS meetings, but assum-
ing that the other six to seven percent 01
the eight percent practice Judaism on
their own (there are no synagogues in
town and no other Jewish group on
campusl, that still leaves 27 of the 35
percent who don’t concern themselves
with it,

As far as the Gentile 65 percent 01
Grinnell is concerned, I‘ve encountered
only one or two true antisemites here.
Perhaps there are more hiding behind
Grinnell-brand Liberal facades. (I
would not be surprised if some at these
people didn’t even buy bagels because
of their connection with Jews. We must
pity these people.) But it is not the non.

The 35 percent makes itself apparent

neuroses are evident (I have them
too), and there are even some
characters verging on Jewish
stereotypes (the potential Jewish

an excuse to miss school on the ngll
Holidays. Some scorn Jews and become
the worst antisemites.

Throughout history, Jews in ditterent
countries have gone through this
assimilation process (though probably

would have lost theirs by now.

there are the members of the species [If
American Jew who will recite to you a
list of famous, influential, intelligent
Jews in history, as if their being Jewish
allows them to share the Credit. Or
perhaps they believe they are defen-
ding Jews against future attacks. (If so.
they are probably defeating their own
purpose a they are only alienating
more people.) There exists also the Jew
who bitterly bears the burden of all the
persecution oi Jews in history, and he,
also is constantly on the defensive.

But for the most part, the Grinnell
Jew’s only Jewish characteristic may
be that he/she likes bagels. Many have
been raised with little or no religious
training. Others have gone through the
American Jewish compromise: They
belong to a synagogue (their parents
give money), where they attend ser»
vices twice a year. They go to Hebrew
School, where they learn prayers whose
meaning they do not know. They go on
and become Bar or Bat-Mitzvahed (en-
try into the Jewish adult world), and a
few continue through Confirmation,
complaining all the way. Then they
sever their ties competely. (i even
know some tamilies who actually only
remained members of a synagogue un~
til their youngest child was Bar or Bate
Mitzvahed.)

When, alter this upbringing, these
“Jews” reach rebellion age, they
understandably reject what little of
Judaism they had, along with their
parents' other values. Most of them be
