Governor Charles w. Bryan of Ne-
brasloa, vvns a, guest of President
Patrick J. Mahan, of Creighton ,uni-
veisity at the CreightwiaGl-iimell

. football game today.

(Special lo Tlic Scarlcl and Black)

OMAHA—Creighton had some sur-
prises for Gl-lnnell when football
teams of the two schools met in the
Creighton stadium in Omaha this at-
teinoon.

One surprise was a new form of
defense developed by the Blueiays in
secret practice. They used it in a
game for the first time last Saturday
against the Oklahoma Aggies and
the new formation held the “pony
backs" scoreless for almost a half
.hour. Weaknesses developed later
and Coach Arthur Stark has polished
up these rough spots this week.

Moran in Bacldield

In addition, the Pioneers faced a
new backfield combination today,
Cornie Collin, regular left halfback
this season, was shifted to the second
team. John Moran took Collin’s posi—
tion in the backfield, and served as
key man in many offensive plays.

The change was the result of
Moran's good showing in previous
games. Going into the game with
Drake at the half, Moran led a sec-
ond period rally that carried the Jays
across the Bulldog goal once and
threatened to score several other
times. Both Moran and Collin are
sophomores.

Worthing Kicks

With Collin out of the lineup, Cap-
tain Bill Worthing, quarterback,
handled most of the kicking.

The game was Creighton’s last
contest for the season and was
broadcast over station KOIL. Mem-
‘bers of the Grinneil squad will be
Creighton‘s guests at “Campus Nita,"
a collegiate dance, tonight.

Crinnell Gridmerl
Have Easy Week

Grinnell college gridiron huskies
closed a week of light practice yes-
terday with a day of rest before
starting for Omaha to tackle the
Creighton university Blucjays this
afternoon. They did not scrimmage
during the week and did not practice
on Monday.

Signal drills, held despite rainy
weather Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday, were devoted chiefly to
polishing the aerial attack, and in
perfecting some new pass plays fea-
turing Thomas in the role of receiv-
er instead of his usual tossing posi~
ltion.

McCreary, Lake Back
McCrcary went through regular
drills after being out with an injured
knee last week. The rest of the
,squad appears to be in the best shape
of the season; Ullrich being the only
veteran on the bench.

Lake is back in shape for work at-
tackle but Gould is still getting a
regular call. Christofferscn is still
nursing a. bad hand but it has

lPlayers Sponsor
Guild Production

of ‘Apple Cart’

Grinncll play-lovers, through, the
sponsorship of the local chapter of
National Collegiate Players, will have
an opportunity to see Bernard Shaw's
latest comedy, “The Apple Cort."
Tuesday evening. Doc. 3, in the high
school auditorium.

The play, which is touring the
United States under the ouspiccs of
Arthur M. Oberfelder, is a New York
Theatre Guild production with a
cast made up of 20 London and New
York players.

As a part of a movement started
last spring, the New York Theatre
Guild and other producing organiza-
tions are this year making the ex-
periment of bringing some metro—
politan productions into the smaller
towns, particularly into college
towns. The New York Producers may
next year present a variety of plays
in their transcontinental tours.

”The Apple Cart" has the distinct-
ion of arousing the most controversy
of any play given in the lost quarter
century. The comedy has a daring
theme of royalty vs. Democracy, and
shows a complete roundabout-face
of Bernard Shaw as a champion of,
the proletariat and supremo public;
defender. The play is said to abound
with the customary Shavion witti-

Frank Duncan, Missouri Valley’s

points for the six games played this
season. Although this is his first
season in any kind of football camper
tition, he has snared six passes from
Hank Thomas, Grinnell‘s elusive
quarterback, for touchdowns and one
more for an extra point for a total
of 37.

Thomas, who has a definite claim

to all-state and all-western grid hon—
ors, is second with 15 points, three
{touchdowns and one converted point.
He is the only man on the squad to
score from scrimmage, since the re-

(Professor of Organ)

In a program demanding high
musicianship from first to last, Ber-
tho Shutts Smiley, for a long time
our colleague in the department of
.music, opened the recital course last
Saturday in a brilliant performance.
Hcr playing is supremely artistic,
which means that all its resources,
technical, intellectual, emotional, are
fused into manifestations of beauty
in every measure that She plays.

The noble organ prelude and fugue
of Bach in A minor, transcribed for
piano by Franz Liszt, opened the pron
gram, a dignified tonol structure of
immense magnitude, requiring keen
scnse of proportion and architectural
symmetry to realize its contcnt.
From this example of severe classic

 

not,cisms and ropartec, yet the humor beauty she passed dL once, with coin-

seriously bothered him in any game‘yis broad enough to appeal to the plete success, to Beethoven's tendcr

of the parting. loneliness, and joyous
meeting again of sweethearts. The
contrasts thus evoked portrayed the
broad range of Mrs. Smiley's musical
sensibility, and insured, to those who
perhaps were not aware of what was
coming, an evening of rare musical
enjoyment.

In the lovely intermezzos by
Brahms, surcly among the most inti-
matc mossoges any composer has
ever embodied in tone, and the ma-
zurkas and barcarollc by Chopin
which followed, Mrs. Smiley made
our hattlc-scarrcd piano sound like a
million dollnrs.

It is convcntional to close a piano
program with something sparkling

where the cocktails come first. Dc-

Many Injured

Second Period Touchdowns
Top Later Rally

by Pioneers

Opening up a hard driving attack
in the second quarter, Iowa State
Teachers college freshman team won
a 13 to s victory over the Grinnoll
yearlings here last night. Mohr of the
Tutor‘s plunged for one of their
touchdowns and passed to Peterson
for the other. Grinncll-s plunging
quarterback, Fini, scored the little
Pioneers’ only touchdown, ofter mark
blocked a Tutor punt on the 20-yard
line.

The second half of the game was
marked by numerous injuries on both
sidcs. Kingery was taken out with a
broken nose, and Crews and Krider
received leg injuries. Stribley, Tutor
end, received a broken nose on the
first kickoff.

Plrmge to Score

Neither team made headway in the
first quarter, and the punting honors
were about even. The Teachers of—
fensive opened up in mid-field in the
next quarter when a power play took
them to the 25—yard line. Plunges
through the line ended in the first
Score.

The Pioneer frosh received but
O’Dea. intercepted a pass on the first
play and on the second play Mohr
passed to Peterson for the second
touchdown w'lthin two min-
utes. Anderson's place kick in the
first try for extra point was good,
but his second attempt was blocked.

rim Plunges Over

Grinuell's lone touchdown came in
the third period. After State Teach-
crs recovered Crew’s fumble on the
20~ydrd line, Clark drove through to
block the Tutor punt. Lateral passes
and a penalty put the ball on the one
yard stripe, and gave Fini an oppor-
tunity to plunge aver. Grinnell's try
for extra. point was smothered,

The Tutor safety came after An-
derson downed a long Grinnell punt
on the Pedagog's five—yard line. A
fumble by the Teachers was recover—
cd by Mohr behind the line and he
stepped out of bounds there to give
the Pioneers the other two points.

Near Goal at End

Following the kick the Pioneers
opened up with a Series of passes in
a futile attempt to put across a win-
ning score. The Grinnell frosh work-
ed thc boll down to the 22—yard line,
but a pass to the goal line failed, and
a sccond pass was intercepted as the
game ended.

McMillan, center for the little Pio-
neers, and Fini were the mainstays
on the defense, while Fini and Clark
shown on offense. By the fourth
quarter, injuries had forced the team
to he made up largely of second
string men, and that wrth the six in-
cligibilitics was a handicap.

Injuries Slow Crzune

Mohr and Peterson did most of the
yard gaining for state Teachers,
while Carson, tackle, continued to
break through the line and upset
Pioneer plays. On the whole Ander—
sun‘s printing outdistanced that of
Clark, but one blocked punt re-
sulted in a score.

The second half was slowed up
while injured men were given time
to recover.
