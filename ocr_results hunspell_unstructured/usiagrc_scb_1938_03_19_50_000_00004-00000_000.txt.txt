WAR CLOUDS

That the current critical situation in
Europe is an inevitable result of the Treaty
of Versailles is almost so obvious as to go
without saying. Each day's news shows
more clearly the repercussions of this
treaty.

In other words, this is to say that in the
current situation can be seen not merely
selfish desire on the part of dictators, nor
brute force alonel Rather, the current situ—
ation is the boiling over of the pent up
desires of nations, suppressed since 1917
by the treaty provisions

We must not, of course, oversimplify the
issues involved in the serious issues at
stake in Europe today. To say that the
Treaty of Versailles is the only cause of
the present crisis is to be either foolish
or ignorant.

Ouixpoint is simply that one must not
place the blame on Nazism, national selfish,
ness, or brutal tendencies on the part of
the dictators, but must realize that the
current situation is the result of unwise
tampering with political and territorial
rights which should have been left alone
to continue the gradual process of chance
they had undergone through the centuries.

7G—
CULTURE WITHOUT PAIN

Unknown to many, the Young Women’s
Christian association has bcell sponsoring
for the past few weeks a series of after
dinner meetings in the quadrangle drawing
rooms at which students and faculty menr
bers have presented programs of interest
to all.

Some few of these meetings have been
open to the men of the college and all are
open to all women.

In line with the amount of talk we hear
about taking advantage of the cultural ad-
vantages of college, may we suggest that
these meetings are a painless, and even
very pleasant method of doing just that

thing.

PISTOLS . . . 7

(Reprinted From The Daily O'Collegian)

A century ago the pistol was patented
by Andrew J. Holt, an obscure inventor.
What a part this device has played in the
settlement of our country. The west was
settled by pioneers who packed a revolver
on the hip.

The day, however, when it is necessary
for people to carry a gun is over. Laws
need to be enacted to prevent indiscrimi-
nate sale and ownership of pistols.

ARE THEY DESIRABLE?

The question selected for the coming
women‘s intramural debate, “Resolved: that
freshman women of Grinncll college be
housed in cottages also occupied by upper-
classmeu,” is particularly appropriate for
the groups by whom it will be discussed.

This subject is one which has never been
given the consideration ill public that it
has ill the private of feminine hull sessions.
Now that Forensic, a women’s group, has
brought the question out into the open it
is to be hoped that the factors affecting
both sides of the question will be thrown
open to the public gaze.

The more obvious argument in favor of
the present plan is that it is easier for new
women to adjust themselves to the strange
conditions of college life unhampcl'cd by
upperclass domination.

On the other hand, there is considerable
feeling ill the quadrangle that it would be
better to promote the contact between
freshman and upperclass women, having
some of each group living in the some cot-
tage. Adherents of this point of view point
out that such contact would be valuable not
only for social but also for governmental
l'eE‘LSOHSl ,

The question is, of course, not one which
can or should be settled in a moment. It is
one, however, which is of pertinent interest
to every woman in the quadrangle and
every member of the administrative staff
of this college.

The coming debates may do much to de-
cidc the question of the desirability of sep
arate freshman cottages.

WHY EDITORSTG—

(Reprinted from The Upper Iowa Collegian)

We reprint a little editorial which, like
many gems of its peculiar category, crops
up here and there with periodic regularity
in printing and journalistic circles. This
one has the sly humor its author intended
if one reads only the caption ”A Boy’s Es-
say on Editors."

“1 don’t know how newspapers got into
the world, and I don’t think God does, for
he ain’t got nothing to say about them in
the Bible. I think the editor is the missing
link we read of, and stayed in the bushes
after the flood, and then came out and
wrote the thing up, and has been here ever
since. If the editor makes mistakes, folks
say he ought to be hung; but if the doctor
makes mistakes he burics them and people
don’t say nothing because they can't read
and write Latin. When the editor makes
mistakes there is a big law suit, and swear-
ing and a big fuss, but if a doctor makes
one there is a funeral, cut flowers and per-
fect silence. A doctor can use a word a
mile long without him or anyone else know—
ing what it means, but when the editor uses
one he has to spell it. If the doctor goes to
see another mall‘s wife, he charges the man
for the visit but if the editor goes he gets
a charge of buckshot. Any college can make
doctors to order, but editors have to be
born."

#G—
RELIGIOUS FILMS
A NEW APPROACH . .

(Reprinted From The Daily O’Collegian)

No one denies that motion pictures have
a powerful influence on the habits and
thoughts of our people. But only to a slight
degree has religion utilized the film in,
dustry as a courier of its beliefs. Dramas,
romances, historical pictures, in fact almost
any type one could name, would be made
on religious subjects. The subjects might
be ancient, modern or medieval. Such films
should be as profitable as any other.

in England a wealthy Methodist church,
man has advanced money for several
religious films. Well acted, they have a
tremendous potentiality for doing good, In
our country the field has hardly been
touched. We look forward to seeing Martin
Luther, Cotton Mather, John Wesley and
other famous churchmen brought to life on
the screen.
