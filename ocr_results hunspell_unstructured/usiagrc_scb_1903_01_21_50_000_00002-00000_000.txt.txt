AST Friday the President
gave an inspiring chapel

talk on qualities necessary for suc-
cess. While prepared papers are
presumed to give more matured
thorrglrt, we think we are sate in
saying that these more int'ormal
talks are more appreciated by the
Friday morning audiences. Stu-
dents like something that keeps
them right here at home and the
familiar talks go straight to the
mark, when a more elaborate ef-
fort would fail to bring nearly as

good results.
inERE are many calls upon
students (or money and in
the next few days every one will
be asked for a contribution for
paying the athletic union debt.
While the calls are many. this is
one that should not be neglected.
No one is asked to give above his
means, but there is no one. not
one, but who can give something.
And it every one gives a little the
result will be a good total, Twenty-
ﬁve eents lrom every student and
faculty member would make a
snug sum, yet it shows what a
little from each will do.

torrcal contest and the Hyde prize
contest. The argument seems to
be that an enthusiasm and utter-
est in oratory will be increased by
havingjust as little oratory in a
year as we can. Furthermore,
the way to arouse and sustain
such an interest is not only to
have more than one contest, but

especially is to hold contests in
which undeI-classmen can be urged
to enter. Orators are made by
training and preparation and
should begin this work as soon as
they enter college. The Hyde
prize contest offered some
little opportunity tor this. But
under the new system suggested.
the new student would see upper
classmen entered, and feel difﬁ-
dent about pitting himselt against
such a poweriul being as a Junior
seems to be to a Freshman. Unr
der the Hyde pr 16 system Fresh
rnen compete with Freshmen and
seem to have a fair chance of win-
ning. but in the eyes oi new men
acontest with older men would
seem one to be avoided, and in a
few years the result would be two
or three entries in every contest,
no interest at all among under
classmen and very little anywhere
in the school. The way to arouse
interest, we repeat, is to give the
underclassnren many chances or
entering into competition, keep
them practicing and the enthusir
asrn will grow, Give more oppor-
tunities, not fewer, and don't
oblige a man to make his ﬁrst es
say against Juniors and Sopho
mores. Iowa College regrets that
a better showing has not been
made of late in the State contest.
Yet here is a plan which will
probably keep the Freshmen rrorn
oratorical training and is sure to
keep out of the home contest the
most experienced men in school,
the Seniolsr For by choosing
the state orator a year ahead at
this home contest, that contest
will be conﬁned to the three lower
classes. It we want to develop
interest in oratory let us give
every one a chance to enter as
many contests as possible and not
conﬁne our efforts to one contest
a year, practically open toluniors
and Sophomores.
