Harriers Seek Win
In Ripon Conlesl;
Losl To Lawrence

By Tom Super

Grinnell's harriers will at-
tempt to get back into the win
column tomorrow when they
play host to Ripon. The meet
will start at 1:00 pm. on Ward
field.

The thinclads minus three of
their top five runners, because
of flu, dropped a 15-40 deci»
sion to Lawrence last week
Lewis Sachs paced the Pio-
neer runners by taking sixth
place. Sachs was followed by
Art Kisser, Norm Sonju, John
Kennedy and Chris King, re-
spectively.

Ripon proved easy prey to
Grinnell last year, falling 23-38.
Coach Irv Simone says Ripon
has a fair team but he couldn’t
think of any particular standout.
Irv’s main concern this week is
his own squad. Chuck Yoak is
on the sick-list and it is doubt—
ful that he will run, Norm Son-
in will be on the bench nursing
the bone bruise on his heel that
he received last weekend. Cap-
tain John Welden and Wall
Neevel will be able to run Sat

, urday although the flu weakened
them considerably.

The Pioneers now have a dual
meet record of one win and two
losses, and a second in a tri-
angular meet.

As Langan, Cowles
Score Firsl Wins

By Larry Lauer

lM football got under way
Thursday, Oct. 3, with Langan
and Cowles racking up the first
victories of the season.

Favored North fell to a
sparked Langan team 6-0, It
was Bob Troxler, a transier
student from UCLA leading
the Langan line, which aver-
aged 185 Langan’s combina-
tion running and passing at-
tack consisting of Bill Mur—
ray, Tets Najita, Dodd Millar
and Bill McCormac scored the
only touchdown.

On the same day Cowles de<
feated Gates 7—0. The two teams
were stagnant at mid-field till
Cowles quarterback Jerry Gray
went to the air,

Last Friday, ’Oct. 4, South
and Smith played to a scoreless
tie. Smith, who suffered the loss
of their champion quarterback
John Copeland, failed to score
behind McDonald Brian. Smith's
defensive play was however ef-
fective, as Paul Kantzler was
held to a minimum of completed
passes.

Friday’s play saw what ap-
peared to be a scoreless tie end
in a 3-0 victory for Dibble.
Clark was snuffed out by Gor-
die Young who booted a ﬁeld
goal in the last three seconds
a! play.

On Monday of this week,
Langan smashed to their second
victory by downing Gates ls—ur
In the first quarter, Murray
Icompleted a long pass to Me-
Cormac who ran for the ﬁrst
TD. Murray scored again in the
third quarter by sprinting
around his right end. The final
score attributed to the combina-
tion of Murray to McCormac
came in the last quanterr

The game scheduled for Mon-
day between Gates and Smith
was cancelled.

South and Clark played to a
scoreless tie on Tuesday, both
teams being at less than full
strength. Influenza caused a can~
cellation between North and
Dibble on the same day, No
games were played on Wednes-
day.

ing except decide the cham-
pionship of Illinois and re-
duce the number of last-place
teams Three weeks ago Knox
would have been heavily fa»
vored, but today the game is
strictly a toss-up—the two
teams have almost identical
records against Carleton and

Cornell, each losing to the
humor by two touchdowns,
and to the latter by one TD.

much needed rest to prepare
