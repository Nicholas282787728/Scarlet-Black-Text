While Washington has not an impos-
mg record thus iar this season, the
Pihers are large and play a good brand
oi basketball, and the Pioneers will be
iorced to the limit to win. It is alto-
gether possible that Grinnell can win,

up to the standard they have set all

Meet Drake First,

The Pikers meet Drake at has Moinus

It Griunell can make two cleanups in
the series with Washington and Drake,
she will be autranlting both oi these
schools. Tilerhitch is the "if.”

The Pioneers have been hard at
work thus iar this week in prepara‘
tion tor the Pike battles, and although
the scruhs have been substituted in
varsity lineup during the week, it is
not probable that Coach Sherman will
engineer any shakeups. Janssen, who
has been out ior two weeks with an
injured ankle, is back on the squad
and is rounding into condition again.

In view oi the iact that the Pioneers
have their best chance thus tar in the

is expected to turn out en niasse tor

Opinion on Philosophical
Reason For Art.

“Art is something that the world
usually supposes it can do without."
did John Driukwater, ruinous English

large and app clative audience Mou-
day night in Herrick Chapel on “An

English Dramatists View at Abraham
‘Lincolll", “But everybody."

he con»
tinued, "gets some pleasure from art

‘oven though he does not think s .

He accounted for this unllersal
pleasure in art by saying that the
i ind is constantly absorbing great
volumes of experience, which flowing
to the mind steadily, remain in a cha-

‘olic state and are not understood.

Then this'large amount or experience
becomes an irrlmnt to the mind. It
is thereiore necessary to crystalize
this experience and thus do away with

‘Lhe chaos.

they then become intelligible.

then a man attains to public
leadership," said Mr, Drinkwater.
“he gradually begins to lose human
sympathy, and as soon as he does
that he iails to invest his oiiice with
a moral power. When he leaves ot-
fice, such a one is readily ior-gotten,

“Once in a long while we lind a
man, whose mind is oi a highly im-
aginativc character and he impresses
his grcahiess [or all time." ,

Lincoln is Example

In the opinion oi Mr. Di-inkwater,
such a man was Abraham Lincoln.
That is also why he was such a good
figure tor a play such as Mr. Drink—
water composed. There have been
two really great men during the past
three hundred years, Cromwell and
Lincoln, according to Mr. Drinkwater,
who asserted that Lincoln probably
attained his greatest achievement
when he issued the proclamation oi
emancipation, because oi his iiisatiate
fondness ior individual liberty.

Ho conclude his lecture by express-
ing the pleasure it gave him to be
aware of the existence at a mutual
understanding between England and
America, despite- the supcrficlitlly pre-
valent opinion to the contrary.

Preceding his lecture, Mr. Drinks
water delighted his audience with the
reading oi several at his own poems,
“The Vagabond," "L
“A Prayer," “Mi-s, Willow,“ and "Air
tlicuy Crandell.”

The play "These Mothers", adapted
by Many Harris, ‘23, from a magazine
story, "Mrs. Upton Has Her Fling,"
was presented in the auditorium Tues~
day evening. The play is arranged in

living room or the Upton home. Spec-
ial scenic eiiects, planned and ar-
ranged by students of the dramatic
writing class, were used.

The leading parts in the play were
taken by Mrs. W. H. Bridge, as Mrs.
Upton, and by Edna. Gavin, Wilma
Thompson, and Charlotte Wilson, as
her daughters. The ﬁnal scene, in
which the daughters come to under-
stand (he action of their mother was
the stellar scene in the play.

The door proceeds amounted to ap-
proximately ﬁfty dollars and will be
used to defray expenses and to in-
crease the student endowment fund.

The ﬁrst iour awards are made en-
ttll'ely on the scholarship basis, the
itwo men and two women who smnd
highest in point of grades being auto-
matically rnade members at the local
chapter. At the end oi the year a num-
ber ‘not to exceed oncvseventh oi the
ltolal member-ship in the senior class
will be chosen.

The iollowing paragraph irom the
[local chapter, known as the Beta chap-
ter oi Iowa, gives the exact method of
determining which students are to he—
come wearers oi the key:

, "Average grades shall be computed
in the following manner: Marks oi the
freshman year shall not be considered.
at the subsequent ma‘rks,‘tbe number
or hour oi A grade shall be multiplied
,hy ﬁve; number or hours B grade shall
,be multiplied by iour; number ot
hours oi C grade by two, number oi

Toi these products shall be divided by

{gle E aiter the freshman year shall
:disqualify the candidate."

the order announced. It was said to-
day that the ﬁlth in standing in the
senior class was only a very little be-
liind the iourtb, and was barely nosed
out of a place. This student will prob-
ably be awarded member-ship with the

Here’s Time W h e It
You Don’t Want to
Be In Style.

You might as well be dead as to be
out oi style, according to iollcwers of
some oi the latest clothing tads, but
occasionally a lad comes along that is
not so desirable, say some ot the
Quadrangle women, They also add
that to hem style in this case means
being nearer dead than alive, and
means being a whole lot less happy
than to be out or style.

Their latest fad is small pox. Five
women are hiding their iaces from
the taunting outside world today be-
cause they are ‘ztll puckered “17’ with
those little red splotches. Some are
already in communication with beauty
doctors as to the probability or their
iaces being permanently 'pucliered‘.

Some say it is mean to talk about
those poor sick girls this way, but
the runny part oi it is, they are not
severely ill, and there is little chance
or an epidemic. In the meantime they
are really enjoying themselves ,as
much as could be expected.
