A total of 682 students, faculty,
and stall surrendered a small
portion of their time tand flesh)
Tuesday to take advantage at the
free swine flu Vaccine offered at
the Health Center. Thtsnumber
isn‘t even 50 per cent of the campus
community and 7s pcr cent im.
munization is required to destroy
the chances of a swine flu
epidemic

'Atter counting and recounting
the number of vaccines given,
Irma Hall, Health Center super-
visor. was disappointed that so few
had been immunized. She hopes for
enough demand to be able to
acquire more of the serum and
tnnoculaie those who didn't get
their shots Tuesday.

Laziness, shot phobia and such
claims as “I'm immune to
everything," “I don't want to be
well when everyone else is sick,"
and “The shot reaction and side
effects would be worse than the
flu,” were reasons given by
students who failed to receive their

swine flu vaccinations. The initial
(and in most cases the only)
reaction of those who submitted
was fear of the vaccine gun which
looks and sounds like a Star Trek
laser gun. The second reaction
most had was shock at the lack of
pain transmitted by the gun.

For 48 hours after the shot is
given seine people experience
stitfness around the site of the shot,
chills, headaches, or fever but
these people are the exceptions
rather than the rule Also, the shot
is incapable of causing the flu
because it is made from dead
viruses. Said Irma Hall, “Any
reaction to the vaccine would be
nothing a couple of aspirin could~
n’l take care of."

In order for the immunization to
he complete for 1&25 year olds, it
must be accompanied by a booster
shot after an days, The initial shot
is only temporary protection. The
booster will be available at the
Health Center when students‘
return from Christmas break.

 

 

QAlums convene for second

White'Pap'er conference

by Dave Wick

Together with 47 alumni from
various areas oi the country, 27
faculty and staff members and 15
students participated in the second
and final “White Paper weekend.”
Seven small group conferences and
a series of five discussion
workshops were held, each cen-
,icring on a different aspect of the
Position Paper. These included
admissions, curriculum, campus

lllle and relationships, institutional
finances, and affirmative action.

At present, the notes of the
various discussions have not been
tabulated but. according to
President Turner, they are being
compiled by David Murphy, vice
President for Resources and
External Affairs, and the results
should be more clearly defined by
next week

When asked to compare the
second “White Paper weekend"
with the first, President Turner

tated. “It was the same only

different." Elaborating, Turner
stated, “There was the same
general consensus on issues and
questions as the weekend before:
e.g, strengthen the liberal arts

Qspect of Grinnell, utilize the
alumni in ways other than as
financial resources, Such as 21d-
missions recruitment, career
seminars, internships; conserve
what is good; and maximize the
diversity of the student body and
taculty."

Studentparticipant Mary Brandt
felt that the weekend proceeded in
such a way as to cause everyone to

 

wonderabout its purpose as late as
Saturday night but that, on Sunday
morning, its intent became
evident President Turner in-
dicated that a similar pattern
existed in the first “White Paper
weekend."

Commenting on alumni
response. Turner telt it was a
“very supportive group, Just like
the group of the first weekend ”
However, Turner added, “We
really have to look at the compiled
results of the seven small group
meetings before we can really say
what came out of the Weekend.”

Naomi Farber, another student
participant, expressed the opinion
that the alumni were not interested
in the present needs of the college
community.

“I got the feeling that the alumni
came with preconcieved notions
and weren’t interested in being
brought up to date,” said Farber

Farber also believed that,
earlier in the weekend, the alumni
weren’t too interested in student
opinion but. only later decided that
the students were “doing a good
job” She noted that throughout the
weekend taculty and student af-
tairs personnel were very
receptive to opinions ol student
participants,

Student Puul Mlgliorato felt that
a lot of alumni were unr
del'lnformed as to the purpose of
the workshops and thatmuch of the
workshops were just inrormation
sessions.

In describing the methods for

Choosing alumni, Turner explained
that several lists were put together
by a number ot people in the ad-
ministration, These lists were then
synthesized by Turner himself,
Dean Walker and Dean Tederman.
Walker was very instrumental in
deciding on the final list since, as
Turner says, he‘s been here the
longest and knows a lot of the
alumni The alumni office was also
instrumental in drawing up the list.

In citing the primary criterion
for choosing alumni, Turner said,
“The major factor was, to get a
diverse'group of people devoted to
the College."

Travel subsidies, which came
out ola fund set up for this purpose
by the development otrice, were
offered to alumni. However, ac-
cording to Turner. “remarkably
few” accepted the aid and those
who did were mostly young alumni
who ”don’t really have the bucks
yet.”

On the methods of choosing
faculty, Turner said that for the
first weekend people were chosen
who would “facilitate discussion,"
Turner went on, saying, “The
second time, the downtown office
along with Ruth Montgomery,
Matt Cohen, and Professor Luther

Erickson drew up the list. 0b-
viousty the list was slanted to
people who had been at the College
for a long time and were basically
familiar with the history of
Grinnell."

Student impressions of the
weekend were generally favorable
although often that positiveness
was not formed until Sunday
morning.

Mary Brandt stated that the
weekend “reaffirmed my belief in
liberal arts and Grinnell." She was
interested to hear alumni ob-
servations of what Grinnell
teaches. tcoiitiiiiietl on page 2)
