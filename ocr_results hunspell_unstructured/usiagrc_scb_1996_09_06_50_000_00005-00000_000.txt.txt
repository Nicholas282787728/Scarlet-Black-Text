Balancing the budget: required by law?

By DAVE RDDEL

Those who are against a balanced
budget amendment generally fall into
three categories: those who think we
should balance the budget but should
not amend the constitution to do so.
those whose prosperity and power
rely on spending money we don't
have on things we don‘t need to fur
ther empower a government already
far overestepping its bounds, and
those who lack the amenity ofa fron-
tal lobe.

I see little hope for these last two,
but maybe the ﬁrst group is not too
far gone. To these I speak:

The balanced budget amendment is
supported by the vast majority of
America (a poll published by the
New York Timer puts the percentage
at 75%, while other sources place it
around 80%), but a fairly group feel
that the budget should be balanced
without amending the constitution.

In the halcyon days of yore, when
we as a nation lived within our means
during times of peace, there may
have been no need for a balanced

budget amendment. but in the cur—
rent world of an ignorant populace

and politicians more intent on mak-
ing voters dependent upon them
rather than voting as a representative
of their constituents (almost 2/3 of
Democrats in the house voted against
the balanced budget amendment,
even though 3/4 or more ofAmerica
supports it), we can not afford to be
so trusting in our politicians.
Another main reason for the need
for this amendment comes from the
same idea as that voiced by Dole in
his speech at the GOP convention
concerning money taken by the gov

ernment: “It‘s not their money!" It
is not the present congress' right or
privilege to steal from future genera-
tions. It is bad for elected officials
to wrest money away from the popu-
lation to pay for programs enlarging
the powcrofthc federal govemlnent,
but it is even worse when they steal
from those who have not yet been
born,

Along with this respect for the fu»
ture and the fact that we have too
many politicians we cannot trust.
there is the simple fact that a major-
ity ofAmerica wants a balanced budr
get amendment. I realize that this is
neither a practical reason, nor one
based on any sacred ideology, save
for the fact that the PEOPLE
SHOULD CONTROL THE GOVr
ERNMENT, not the other way
around. ,

/ Is there arty other majority-con-
tended issue where so much of
America is on one side ofthe debate?
If America were Congress, the
amendment would be passed before
the next election, but as long as
people keep on electing those who
prefer to weaken the strong than to
strengthen the weak, there is little
hope for this badlyrneeded measure,

By BEN PATRICK

The balanced budget amendment is
a typical conservative issue in many
ways,

For one, it's based on an idea that
Democrats originally proposed, and
then Republicans stole: a balanced
budget, Also, its a smoke-screen is»
sue: Republicans rode the cry of “Bale
ance the Budget!“ into Congress in
1994. They have had their chance to
balance the budget themselves. Inr

stead, however, they talked about
passing an amendment to force some
one else to balance the budget.

To my mind, this attitude typifies the
debate about a balanced budget
amendment. If we really want a bal-
anced budget, we don't need an
amendment—all we need is a vote,
The debate about an amendment is
little more than a political stalling tac-
tic made by the Republicans because
(contrary to popular myth) the last
thing they want to do is balance the
budget: hey, some defense contractor
might lose his 100rmillion dollar con-
tract to built laserrguided stealth
screwdrivers.

I would also say that I‘m opposed
to a balanced budget amendment on
principal alone. Any rational person
would tell you that it’s the
government's job to give us a bal-
anced budget (except in certain cir~
cumstances that we’ll get to later).
And, as such, they should do it with-
out us having to pass a law that says
that they have no choice.

As an employee of the college.
should I make it necessary for the
Board ofDirectors to pass an amend-
ment to the by-laws of Grinnell Cole
lege that says I have to do my job?
The very thought is ludicrous. Yet,
the notion is the same: no law says I
have to do my job, and Congress
needs no law in order to do theirs.

In closing, let me point ottt onecase
in which a balanced budget amend-
ment would come back to haunt us:
in a depression, During a depression,
it can become necessary for the gov-
emment to deficitrspend in order to
(as FDR did) prime the economic
pump. Should such a time come, we
would heartily regret an amendment
to the Constitution banning deficit
spending.

Muses of a first-year

By KURT ORZECK

Funny thing, time. We spend our
lives watching our watches, some~
times plotting out our days to the
hour, If you didn‘t attend the Con~
ference on “How to Avoid Acar
demic Disaster," then you missed
one of the most obvious examples.
Schedules were passed our for stu~
dents to arrange each of their days
on an hourly basis. Wasted time is
indeed time thrown away, or so we
are taught.

As a freshman, I have been im-
planted into this school amongst
new people, faced Wllh new activi-
ties and a new atmosphere. Re-
cently I have realized that many of
these new furnishings deal with
time. To prove my point, here's a
list of fifty time-related observa»
tions I‘ve made regarding this, my
first week at Grinnell.

Before I begin with the ones that
have taken place on campus, I must
mention the prerGrinnell inci-
dences. Obviously, there's the time
I spent explaining to friends and
family why I chose to come all the
way out here. And also, the time]
spent repeating, “No, not CORnell.
GRInnell,” after people thought I
was heading off to the school in
New York, not the one in Iowa.
Also, there’s the time I used wonr
dering what the school would be
like, which expectations of mine
would be fulfilled, which ones left
unmatched.

Next, thejourney to Grinncll. The
seven hours it took to ﬂy to Minne-
sota, where relatives of mine live.
The four hours of driving through
cornfields the following day. Upon
arrival, the lightning speed of vet-
cran Grinnellians qurickened the unr
loading process immeasurably,
However, the only hand that could
contribute to the unpacking process
belonged to me, and that duty took
a while to perform.

Thirdly, orientation in itself was

an adventure. As well as the inten-
tion may have been, Play Fair ran a
bit too long. But that was counter-
balanced by the wellrspent Rock
Creek day trip through the GORP
program. Also, the length of time
trying to disentangle with the help
of other fellow freshmen a human
knot during one icebreaker, Soon
after, time used trying to figure out
the deal with both numbers and let-
ters on the registration booklet.
That’s not even taking into account
the outrageous four hours devoted
to waiting in line for registration.
Add to that the time spent seeing
movies among other orientation arts
tivities, By the time orientation was
through, it seemed as though de-
cades had passed by.

On the topic of waiting, the meal
line has been quite long, though the
wait for a computer has been non-
existent. Waiting for a shower, for
the laundry to get dry, to cross the
railroad tracks while a train is go-
ing by, those have all been long
waits. On the other hand, time spent
watching television has decreased
drastically.

Imustmention all the timerrelated
activities concerning my ﬂoor, too.
The time gleefully spent eradicat-
ing our ﬂoor of ﬂies. The two and
a half hours devoted to rattling off
names of past WWF wrestlers with
other floormates. Then there’s the
time my roommate and I spent try-
ing to convince non-Massachusetts
residents that candlepin bowling
dues in fact exist. Also the time
bickering over the true name of a
piece of candy on a stick - a lollir
pop or a sucker. Finally, the 30 or
so seconds it takes to walk up to the
third ﬂoor in our hall.

Then there’s the time spent meet-
ing dozens ofpeople, Shortly after,
the time spent trying to remember
their names (though I have their
homerstates down pat). There's the
time I‘ve spent sleeping instead of
eating breakfast, trying to ﬁgure out

how to lock our door, searching seven
ﬂoors for an iron and ironing board
and coming up empty handed. The
fact that my fan hasn't stopped run-
ning since I got here, the frequency
I‘m reminded that a tornado could hit
here by the cyclone wan-ling on our
door. The endless time already spent
playing PingrPong, of staring in awe
at a resident family walking their pet
pig in town.

Of course, there’s the decrease in
time spent in the classroom as com—
pared to high school, but at the same
time the sharp increase in time used
for homework. The time spent hav-
ing night conversations with some
very interesting people, the long time
it would take to walk to Wal-Mart (if
I ever chose to do so), the time wak-
ing up my roommate (who has early
classes) when I get in late. Conse-
quently, my roommate waking me up
when try to sleep in (for my later
classes).

Also, there‘s the time (220 hours) it
would take for me to walk home non-
stop, the time spent running into a
neighbor who lives less than a mile
down the street from me back home,
the time a student from the Bahamas
accustomed me to reggae music, and
the embarrassingly drawnrout length
of time it takes for a few of us to ac-
tually finish a game ofpool.

In addition, the many hours the li-
brary is available. On the other hand,
the disappointingly minimal hours the
bookstore is open. The strange feel-
ing that two months have passed,
when in reality it‘s only been a little
over a week.

Lastly, there‘s what the future inevi-
tably holds. The amount of time left
until Christmas break, when many of
us will head home for the ﬁrst time,
until some of you Southern kids ﬁrst
see snow (we got 100 feet in Massa-
chusetts last winter, so I’m not about
to be surprised by a few white ﬂakes).
Finally, the three years and ﬁfty-one
weels until the Grinnell chapter of our
freshmen lives will be closed.
