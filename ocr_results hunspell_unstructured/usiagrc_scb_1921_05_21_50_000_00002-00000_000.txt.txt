uousrz SPIRIT

with the announcement of the de—
tails that are to govern the selection
of the rooms in the Quadrangle and
the Dormitories tor the next schaoll
year, there again arises the question
ot the establishment of distinctive
buildings and of the fostering of
building spirit. At the Quadrangle,
this has been largely taken care of in
the setting aside of individual cot—
tages for class groups. This is dis—
tinctly a fol-Ward step in Living con-
ditions for the girls and promises, in
large measure, on do away with many
former disadvantages of Quadrangle

At the dormitories; the situation is
more complex and of a ditferent char-
acter. House spirit at the dormitories
is a hindemental element in the much
discussed and highly desirable “Grin-

form in which the men can express.

intramural games have done much to

The men of Grinnell are' being
given an opportunity to make of the
dormitories what they will. If the

CONCERNING ll‘HE XEAR
When one embarks on a long voy-
age, it is customary to have a deli ite
itinerary at hand, and to tollow the
advice and experience of those who
have gone before Today, the Scarlet
and Black is embarking on a long
journey, with the assumption or full
duties by the new stall, and is leaving
port under the direction of a new
crew. Thus it seems wise to consider
the course that shall be followed (lure,
ing the coming year, and to pick out
some of the land marks of the past
season.
In taking over from Mr. Waltz and
, Miss Sibley the direction of the Scar-
let and Black, in looking back over
the past, and in considering the ex—
perience of those who have gone be—

Editor Scarlet and Black —

Dear Sir:

We have long had the impression that
all places on Grinncll athletic teams
are upon to competition and are to go
to the mitn best qualified for the
place, regardless of position or of any
favoritism. It seems linwcver, that
in at least one sport such is not the
case. Last year Grlnllcll entered a
comparatively new field of sport
when she established a tennis team
which competed with other Missouri
Valley tennis teams and entered the
hi uri valley meet. At that time,
four men got together, salt “We are
lhe tennis team," and the bunch was
lrun by the captain rather than by a
coach, or thin regular channels. There
,was no opportunity ’for competitive
‘tlyouts for places on the squad, altho
lthesc men may have been the best
blaycrs in the school and did make a
vciy creditable showing. At the pres-
ent time Grinnell is represented by a
team of only two men, neither of
whom has prov-en in competition that
he is the best in school,

If Grinnell is to continue tennis as
a form of hcr athletics, some sort of
competi on to provide berths on the
I‘sduad should be formed and letters
should be granted the team when it
wins other Missouri Valley matches.
Matters should not be permitted to
run in the fashion in which they have
been going and the game should be
either discontinued or else placed in
the hands of competent authorities,
preferably under the direction of the
Athletic Department, and the game
should be conducted thru regular
channels
A GROUP or STUDENTS.
Editor Scarlet and Black,

Dear Si

Some time ago there appeared ﬂl‘
ticles in the Scarlet and Elaclt rc-
garding the naming oi the remaining
three buildings of the‘hien's Dormi-
tory group. At this time, the passing
out of the old and the coming at the
new, it seems proper to recall the sub-
ject to the minds of the authorities.
Commencement time, with its homer
coming 01 the graduates of former
years, and its numerous festivities,
appears to be the most logical tune
of any in the year for action to be
taken in this matter, for it marks the
end of the old regime and affords an
opportunity for the establishment of
higher and better ideals for the next
year,

This matter of naming Buildings
111, Iv; and'VI has been thoroughly
argued hefore, and has been decided
for the future. Nuw, the only thing

, remaining is to carry out the actual

details and that should be done lmmer
dlately.
