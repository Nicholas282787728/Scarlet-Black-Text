(mITl-l spring vacation but a

.little over three weeks disc
tant, it is time some thoughts were
given to track work. The winter
term being long. the spring term
is correspondingly short and we
have the same problem confront-
ing us which raced us last year—
that ot the home meet coming but
a little over a week after school
begins. Now is the time to lay a'
toundation tor the spring work
and the responsibility rests upon
the old men even more thah the
new. It is the men who have
worn the emblem before who must
point outthe way tor the new ones
seeking positions on ‘the track
team. The same applies with
equal pertinence to the old base-
ball men. Whether training shall
be thorough, or only halfrhearted
and grudgingly done, rests with
them. There are institutions
which can rely upon the inﬂux of
tot-trier high school stars for
material with which to make up
their athletic teams. and with
them training is more a matter of
formality than fact. The same
has never been true of Grinnell.
She must secui-e her point—win-
ner's by her own efforts; she must
make them by the dogged, per-
sistent and conscientious training
she gives them. Several of her
most brilliant athletes, at the be
ginning ot their careers. were
the laughing-stock or their team
mates, One thing the new man
must conquer and that is the dis-
couragement which cannot tail to
come at the start. There are so
many who can do, better that the
inclination is to give up. That is
the time, above all others, when a

man needs his stick»to-itrivcness.
This is not the place for recount»

and temperate habits are the
prime essential. The person who

The same is true or the man who

one of the most unique personal-
ities of any man on the American
lecture platform to-day and there
is unusual eagerness among the
students to hear him.

It is as the publisher and editor
of the Fhillistine, the magazine of
protest, published “every little
while” and as the head of the
Roycrofters where “beautiful
books and things" are made, that
Elbert Hubbard is most widely

known. In his lecture he de-
scribs the origin of the magazine
