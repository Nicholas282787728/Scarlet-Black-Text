Close Finishes.

Below3are the entries tor the
lowa College isur annual home

ﬁeld iiieet, This meet decides to

a great extent rvho will compose
the team to represent Giiiinell on
the track in Igos, and with the
number of men entered will itlrnr
ish some ﬁne contests. The iiieet
Will be run of! on the new cinder
traclt at Ward Fleld at i;30 sharp,
Saturday atternoon,Aprrl 2;. The
outlook for a close and exciting
home meet is good, but the prose
peets tor;the Season are discourage
ing. with Conger alld Kiesel out,
probably for all season, the team
will be badly handicapped. Grille
nell has not a single man who is
practically siirc of a ﬁrst place at
the state meet, aild with the
titlentyrtour points that we are
obliged to concede our opponents
in tliereights, the chances for
winning the duals are not bright.

The(nieet Saturday will arouse
class enthusiasm, but with Conger
out will probably be won by the
Seniors. The entries are as l'olr

THE MACY CLUE.

/\t the beginning of the pres
ent school year a number of the
students under the leadership of
john
themselves together for the pur-

Gannaway, '03, associated

pose of carrying on an intelligent
discussion oi topics of current in-
terest. During the year blrweekly
meetings have been held, during
most or the yearvariousquest’rons
concerning the Southern States,
such as education, political affairs
and industrial development, have
forinedthe subjects of investiga-
tion and discussion, but the last
few meetings have been devoted
to the study of municipal govern-
ment in the United States.

For lack of a better name the
association has thus far tempor-
arily styled itself the Student
Conference. But with the desire
to ensure the continuance of its
work and existence, the need of a
permanent name and organiza-
tion has been felt. The ﬁrst of
these matters has already settled
itself, The conviction was unane
that other _
could be found as desirable and

inious no name
as expressive or the aim and pul‘»
pose of the organization as that
of The Macy Club and this cone
viction was iornially acted upon

at the held Monday

meeting
afternoon.

The regular program given
conSisted of a review of a recent
