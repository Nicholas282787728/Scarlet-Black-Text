What has become of the Student
Council"? 1: this organization is pitti-
entiy waiting fol‘ some matter to be
presented for its’ consideration we
would suggest that the question of
providing ushers tor the Sunday Yes-
perservioe be taken up. For the past
two Sundays it has been necessary to

. ask the audience to change their seats
'and occupy the usual vacant section
in trout. Those coining trst will
naturally take the back seats while
the people who are late have to take
the iront seats thus disturbing the
service, There,is plenty of room for
everybody at Vesper service but the
appointment of a few ushers would
iacilitate noatters

The Scarlet and Black? oe‘sides its
student‘clrc‘ulatlon in Grinnell has a
large subscription among the Alumni
and it is here probably that the paper
is read,with tho keenest interest. One
member of last year’s class writes, H1
would notbe without the paper iflt
cost 55.00 ii year.” Another Alumnus
says “I intend to be a subscriber to
your sheet ior the next six or seven
decades at least ” _ ’

We wish to thank all our mail sub-
scribers who have answered our notice
ot last week by either sending as word
to stop their paper or to continue it.
We appreciate this kindness and trust
the rest or the last years subscribers
will either notiry us to ireep their
paper going or to stop it within the
nextweek 01 two as it Will greatly
aid us in getting our mailing list into
shape.

way‘and we would appreciate it, if
when you have something to put be-
fore the public you would place it in

GIRLS' ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.

The Girls' Athletic Association held
the ﬁrst meeting of the year yester-
day aiternoun, at which the new otﬁ-
cers were were elected and enthusias-
tic plans ior this year’s activities were
discussed The meeting was called to
order by the Presldent, Ada Thomas,
and the iollowing ouicers were elected:
Pres, Florence Nadler, Sec’y, Edna
Patterson; Treas, Vaahti Kaye
Thesu oilicers, together with M‘ss
Gardner, and the tennis, hockey, and
basket ball managers, will constitute
the Executive Board,

Every girl in school ought to feel a

,Vital interesl‘i in this phase of student

lire. ior athletics are coining to be an
essential part oi the education oi the
all-around collegegirl. We want each
girl to realize that'slie cannot to be
without the advantages which the As
sociationoliers ior development and
pleasure. The nourishing condition
of ﬁnances, especially, permits or very
extensive plans, ini- there is now in the
treasury a sum of over one hundred
dollars, all bills having been paid.
Considering that the orgahi ation has
beenin esistance iust one year, and
that much rnouéy has been spent on
the tennis courts and hockey field,
this is certainly a line showing.

All that is needed is the hearty cur
operationoiallthe girls. A row en.
thusiastic ones can make extensive
plans, but the cannot supply the spirit
which will make the association go.
The hockey held and tenniscourrsai-e

now in order and plans ior other out.‘

door activities are being pushed ror.
ward rapidly. This year an outdoor
basketball court will he provided. It
is hoped that all the new girls, or the
old girls who have played only a little
will use the court particularly while
the regular team girls will assist the
new players and use the court only
occasionally themselves. For the
girl who is interested in rowing, boats
will he provided, at the expense or the
association, and there will be good
rowersto teach the girls who have
never learned.

Still another activity which will Ip~
peal to many or the girls is horseback
riding. Horses will be looked up,
which can be rented on certain days,
and riding habits will probably be iu‘r-
nished to those who need then. With
this wide range of athletic sports, ev-
ery girl should _bn able to iiurl some-
thing pieosing to herselr, so join the
Association, and with your enthusi-
asm, help to make ita powerriil Dr~
ganiration.

Dr. E. A. Steiner: tells us that ale

‘ready he has received word Irgm his

publishers, Revel} on Co , that his new
novel, ”The Mediator” is to be put in
its second edition, the ﬁrst edition of
10,000coples having been exhausted.
This is remarkable as the book has
only been on the counters ashort time.
It is also unusual [or a Writer‘s ilrst
novel to meet with such instant re-
cognition no matter how meritorious
it may be. It merely goes to show
something or the standing Dr. Steiner
has with the reading public of Amok
icairorn hisprevlouswork. Dr. Steiner
stated this morning that on account
of the more or less llmlted appeal
which he expected “The Mediator” to
have, he would have been satisﬁed
with a sale 0110,000. Many typograplr
ital errors will be corrected in the
new edi on which will also probably
be illus rated. .
