Sauls, "It's all very well for people
who sit in safe comfort in some nice office
8,000 miles away to urge disir'ivestment
But it the American auto plants here closed
down, I'll have thousands of men looking

The U.S corporations in South Africa are
not perfect and have a long way to go but
they are better than the alternatives, Thc
Job training and other courses that range
from toolrsetting and literacy to language
training and foreman positions are a major
part of a black's education. Ten percent Oi
Ford's supervisors are black and the cnm~
pany averts a law prohibiting black ap~
prentices by providing the training under a
different name. Colgate-Palmolive's South
Aincan subsidiary pays for all school fees
ior children oi its black employees.

All us, corporations pay their
employees above the Household Subs

Government Firestone, the lowest paying
U.S. corporation. pays its lowest paid
blacks a salary that is 105 percent of the
H S L. Between 1975 and 1980 national
black per capita income rose about 29 per-
cent as opposed to about seven percent for
whites American corporations have been
largely responsible lor this improvement

The U s corporations are also aware of

ntless to hold on to stocks in hopes of me
encing South African policy, since an the

difference The connection arises here

- greatest effect will be in Grinnell, lowa,
: not in South Africa.
hen debating the issue oi divestment,
n, these three questions ought to be of
imary importance: 17 Will divestment

icy or divestment oblige the college to
e ethical stands on other issues as well7
i y not divesting, would i feel good about
self and about Grinnell College knowing
t we are iinancially supporting white

one oi the main problems with arguing
out South Africa is that we are all just too

Africa is for burial insurance Ford arrange
ed with its worker liason committee and lhe
insurance fund serving Ford workers to
deduct dues along with premiums and the
fund would rebate the dues to the commit-
tee, which Is, in effect, a union.

The logical way to help the black South
Africans ls through the U s. corporations
already there Their absence would not
devastate the South African economy and
Whatever civilizlng affect they had would
be lost. as would the only conduit the
American people have to iniluence condi-
tions in South Africa.

It seems to me that divestment is the
coward's way out of the problem it takes
courage and a real interest in helping the
people oi South Airica to lobby the corpora-
tions and iight for improved corporate
policy We, as Grinnellians, should do our
part by putting pressure on the trustees to
draft meaningful proxy statements regarr
ding corporate South African policy. I]
Grinnell has the socxal clout the
G ‘,A S G, thinks it has, then other in
slitutions will follow our lead and there will
be cilective pressure on these corporations
to continue to improve the quality of life loi-
South African blacks

The U.S. Corporations in South Africa are
the only way Americans can influence
social conditons lliere Nothing else has
worked Divestment of U S assets in South
Africa is tantamount to burning the last
bridge,

prehend what eiiect our policies will have
there By placing the focus on the eiiect oi
divestment in Grinnell, we have placed the
question in an environment which we
understand better. Your decision will de
pend largely on your own value structure in
considering matters of conscious and selfr
esteem against those primarily of
economics.

On Oct, 31, the Board will try to decide
not only on a resolution of the South African
question, but also on a comprehensive in
vestor responsibility policy applicable to
all investments. The Board may likely be
forced with a choice somewhere in between
complete divestment irom corporations
which even hint at unethical conduct and
investment in stocks independent of moral
considerations. This will be extremely dilr
iicuit to do, especially considering the {act
that the Sullivan principles, a Widely
publicized program oi justification ior
American investment in many specific car
porations in South Africa, has been de
nouneed recently by Sullivan himseli

We should all try to consider as best as
we can how we feel about this issue, and
make our opinions known, it we so desire,

To the Editor :

In one of last week’s newsbriefs, Jim
Tederman was quoted as saying “people in
south campus have it good compared to
people in north," and that the facilities in
Main Hall lfoui' washers and four dryers)
will serve 300 students, while more than 600
people will have the use of only eight
washers and nine dryers, 0k, I admit I'm a
math major, but I think even a philosophy

major can see that 300 divided by four
equals 600 divided by eight, Plus they have
an extra dryer (and are going to get more
washers and dryers? 1 So how are we better
off, pray tell7 l would also like to note that
all of the East Street houses and most of the
Park Street houses do their laundry on
south, which brings our total to cons
slderably more than 300. Yeah, we really
have it good, don't we? e Susan K Kahii.

An incredible amount at mail is receiv-
ed by the'SRiB every week. Most of it is
rather boring, and some of it is rather in-

teresting. We’re not sure how to classify
this, but we thought you should get a
chance to see it anyway.
