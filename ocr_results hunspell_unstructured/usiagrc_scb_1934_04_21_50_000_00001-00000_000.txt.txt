Presidents Fail to Approve
New Ruling Suggested
by League Board

No action was taken by the Coun-
cil of House Presidents on the new
rule, suggested by the board of the
Women's Self Government league,
to permit women to smoke at open
houses, when the council held
its weekly meeting Thursday
evening. After a lengthy discus-

sion, during which a number of ob
jeCtionS to the rule were offered, it
was voted to lay the question on the
tablc indefinitely.

It is reported that one of the pri-
mary objections to adoption of the
proposal concerned the possible ad—
verse lnflucnce it might exert upon
parents considering sending daugh-
tc Grinnell. Opposition was
likewise explained on the basis that‘
a rule existed prohibiting smoking
outside the quadrangle and that ac-
ceptance of the proposed regulation
would result in untidyness in the hall
clubraoms.

A discussion was also held con-
cerning the problem of holding open
houses on nights when all-college
functions are taking place on the
campus. It was suggested that infor—
ma] affalrs in the halls be limitatl,
on such occasions, to nights when
semester fee tickets do not admit to
the entertainment. Dav‘c Mnlbrough
was appointed by council president
Marion Frye to investigate the possi—
bilities of establishing this rule.

reminiscing seniors recalled the days
of unlimited prepping and complained 1
that freshman “hell week” just isn't
what it used to be.

Prepping committees resorted to
outlandish costumes for their trash
men as means of humbling them af-
ter the repetition of the "no paddling
except by house councilmen for dis—
ciplinary purposes” order, firstplaced
in force last year, Clark freshmon
dressed as angels, while Langan preps
posed as Wimpy, Suitcase Simpson,
and other characters from the comic
strips. A lilo-pound football man
from Kelly Stables rolled a hoop
while clothed in light-blue knee
pants. Smith freshmen were their
traditional kilts, although rumor has
it that "Goon sisters" outfits were
seriously considered at one tlnlc.

:Langan freshmen claimed that
they white-washed Smith in a twrp
event track meet on Ward field Fri-
day morning as a part of their set-
ting-up exercises, while Kelly Stables
preps remained immersed for all sec-
onds in a tub of icy water for their‘

and treasure hunts are planned in sev.

Charlie Agnew Began Famous Career
According to Best Musical Traditions

Brown Derby Band Leader
Won Barental Attention
With Ancient Cornet

Like Handel, who began his musi-
cal career by sneaking into a garret
to experiment with an old harpsi-
chord whose strings he bound to
make silent, Charllo Agnew, whosc
orchestra will play for the Brown
Dcrby Drag on May 5, got his start
during secrct trips to the fondly ab
tic to play with a soundless musical
instrument. The main difference was
that Charlie's first love was'a bah
tcrcd old cornct, and it was mute
only because he lacked the lung pow-
cr to push a noise out of it.

When the glorious day arrivcd that
the first squuwk burst forth from
the ancient instrument, Charlie's
father took an actlvc intcrcst and

might be expected; but he also par-

In his last year in school, Charlie
was offered a place in a well known
local orchestra. which, in a city the
size of Newark, N. J., whcrc he lived,
meant quite an opportunity. He has
