What has

love got to do with it?

Reﬂections on Valentine’s Day

By Laura Hellman

v2l<. A lot ofthings have changed about
valennne's Day. Virtual cards can be sent
and received on the Internet, cemail valene
tines are prevalent, and, if you can’t get a
hold or someone, you can always leave 3
Valentine’s greeting on their voice mail or
answering machine. And at Grin-

nell, you can even give or re;

ceive a singing valen-

tine from the

G r i n n e l l

s i n g e r s

(which I

think is one

of the best

options). But

have things really

changed since our fourthvgrade
valentine’s Day?

Every year I get valentines from a few of
my close friends, and every once in a while,
when I’m feeling creative or sexually frus—
trated, I make my own valentines and send
them out But I’m not sure what valentines
mean. The ones I send out are supposed to

sum is: mwem‘msl: a/vr/e-

show peoplel love that I care about them.
And I think that is the point ofValentinc‘s
Day.

Despite this, everyone I talked to about
Valentine's Day (except those people in
beautiful, stable, and happy relationships;
they think everything is
brought the subs
response

great), when l
ject up, their ﬁrst
was “It sucks."
When l pressed
them further, asks
ing “Why,” most
people still didn't
have much to
say. Valentine's
Day doesn’t seem
to be some-
thing most
people spend
time thinking
about.

Of the people I convinced to talk more
in»dcp(i1 about Valentine’s Day, some had
beautiful stories. Two single girl friends of
mine went out for a romantic dinner to-
gether to celebrate their friendship and an,
joy the holiday. And ofcoutse we all know
a! least one couple who spent a delightful

LAST YEAR I was LuCKY

day or evening together in lover's bliss. How-
ever, there is still the common sentiment that
Valentine's Day sucks.

Why is this?

The purpose ofVaieniine’s Day to most
people is to express love and caring. How
can this possibly present a problem? For the
majority, the problem is being single.

valenrine’s Day makes us think ofpasr
lovers, future lovers and (this is where ninety
percent ofthe trouble comes in) lack ofiov-
ers. For support, Gtinnell students put

together things like the Jilted Lovers poe
etry reading and Harris party Unfortunately,
at times, these events can focus on the nega-
tive. My feeling is that we've got the rest of
the year, ifwe like, to think about how sad
the dating scene is at Grinnell. Valentine‘s
Day is about celebrating love, and trying to
really express how you feel to others.

And we (I hope you’ll give me permise
slon to say this about all ofyou...) are in-
relligent people. We publicize our care about
the environment, polities, Mumia Abu»
Jamal, and we should surely be able'to pube
licize out care for each other.

Most people I talked to felt that
Valentine’s Day gestures oflove and friend»
ship are forced and contrived, and I agree.
Maybe we’re just being cynical or not ap-
preciating the things we have. Maybe.

But I think it’s true. In some ways, not
much has changed since fourthegrade and
our store-bought valentines. Messages on
some valentines are the same kind of im-
personal, signemyeycarbook, verses. And
they don’t have to be.
