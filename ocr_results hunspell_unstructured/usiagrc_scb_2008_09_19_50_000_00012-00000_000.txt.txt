Students should take interest in SGA and pub

Seeking partIClpatlon in SGA

With all the attention being paid to the futuie of
self-governance, it is somewhat surprising that snl'
dents arent paying any attention to student govern
ment,

While more rumors of the demise of self-gavel»
nance are enough to stir apathetic
Giinnell students into a fury, stu—
dents find the lack oi‘participition
in student government laughable.

How is it that Grinnellians
so concerned with their rights to
govern themselves would disregard
the opportunity to participate in
the student government that rep-
resents them and ultimately guarantees them those
rights?

The small nrrrnber of candidates running for the
position of senator this year has been a wake—up call
to the diminishing interest in student government.

SGA affects students’ lives on a daily basis. Since
SGA handles the allocation of budgets, without them
we would not have the luxuries currently availnble to
students free of charge. That‘s right—no concerts,
movies, clubs, or Harris parties.

Most importantly, without SGA we would not
have a system in place where students have the power
to challenge or change school policies.

Student representatives are the easiest way to com—
municate with the administration, and we as students
need to acknowledge their importance.

Senators exist to represent their speciﬁc clusters
and are another resource to ensure that the voices of
students are heard. Students often forget to cake ad
vantage of the many resources student government

offers, but ifldck ofintcrcst continues or \vorseiis,ive
won’t have senators to represent us during those times
when we do ask for it.

\Vhile it is understandable that not till students
are interested in a student governmenr positron, it
shouldn’t be too much to ask that they take an in—
terest in those that do. Pioneer Web makes voting
fast, simple, and convenient, and
still students can't seem to spare
the three mouse clicks it takes to
become an active member of the
student body.

How can we expect the admin-
isttation to take our demands for
selfrgovemancc seriously when we
refuse to become involved in school politics unless our
right to drink is being called into question?

Although the senator elections are over, there are
still plenty of ways students can get involved in SGA,
Chief among these is communicating your student
rights concerns to your scnator, or crlicr SGA om—
cials, rather than whining about them to your friends,
Other ways to get involved include joining commit
tees and readingjoint board minutes.

And next time you see the election announcement
on Pchb, take one minute out ofyour day and vote.

Everyone should go to the pub

When the prospect ofa campus pub first began
to percolatc across the campus, it generated consider-
able excitement. It would promote a broader campus
community, strengthen ties among students, staff and
faculty. It could become a thriving focal point of cams
pus solidarity

But the first semester of the pub proved to be
something short of what was imagined. Patrons were
often few and far between. And as ofeaily May last
semester, just ontHliird of revenues were from food
5a 5, and Lyle's had accumulated a deﬁcit of over
$13,000. Per city ordinance, over 50 percent orrhe
establishment's rexcnues must come from sales of
nonalcoholic food and beverage. Otherwise. Lylc’s
will legally move from being a “pub" to a “bar" and
thus not be able to admit patrons under 21 years
old.

Over half the deficit was startrup costs, and the
city eventually granted rlre pub a reprieve on the
50-50 ordinance. But the specter of an untimely
closing still lingers.

The new year promises a clean slarc for our
concretecncascd watering holc. The pub staff has
already invested in two clarts machines and a juke
box. They promise a wider selection of drinks and
new food items (hello chili dogs!) Students can vote
to add additional beers to the menu, and there's even
the potential for a gmffiti wall.

We are excitedrYou should be too.

So far, the staff of Lylc's certainly seems to be
holding up their end of the bargain—now it's time
to uphold ours.1fwe want the pub to be fun and sol-
vent, it’s up to us. lftlie pub is forced to close, its not
the only thing we'll 105:. With the failure ofsuch a
“grand idea," admi srrators and students alike will
be suspicious offuture plans.

Like most things on this campus, Lylc’s will be
what we make it. So instead of avoiding the pub
when it’s empty. invite your friends. Plus, if you're
lucky, some Wednesday night, you might even be
able to throw back a few with the staff of your fa—
vorite publication.

Mutilation versus multiculturalism: no contest

Junayd Mahmoud ’09 exposes the dangers of the slippery slopes of cultural relativism and moral equivocation

There’s little doubt that multiculturalism in the
United States has enhanced our experience as citizens
and students. Its hens
efits range from socios
economic diversity in
the classroom to enjoy
ing nacho bar in the
dining hall,

America has a histo-
ry of incorporating the best of all its citizens' customs,
and being open to ideas from abroad.

However, allowing for cultural pluralism shouldn't
give wiry to cultural relativism.

I've noticed that a lot of students and professors
here at Grinnell avoid carrying some of their argue
ments to their logical conclusions Simply because dos
irrg so would result in a cultural critique,

Well, sorry to be the bearer ofbad news, but some
ideas arejust plain better than others.

Take female genital mutilation (FGM). it’s the
example that anthropologists always cry foul at But
it’s a perfectly valid example.

Mutilation causes lifelong physical and psycho-
logical damage to its victims, and because ofthat, it’s
wrong,

This happens to he an example where cultural
relativism converges with moral relativism. You won’t

doubt lit'g

our conception ofmoraliry may signiﬁcantly dif—
fer from those that practice FGM, but that doesn’t ex-
cllse us from using our vale
ues as a basis for critique.

And its not like modern
cultures are ancient mono-
lithic institutions deserv~
mg of our silent reverence,
They don't necessarily have
specific deﬁning features that have stood the test of
time

For example, Persian culture in Iran is a hell of a
lot different than it was twenty years before the revos
lutron, and hopeiirlly it wrll be a
lot different twenty years from
now.

cultures are eternally dy-
namic because people will always
be critiquing the status quo and
finding ways to improve their
understanding and interaction with the world around
rhem.Tlrc ideas, customs, and rituals that comprise a
culture should always be open to the sort of critical
analysis we extend to everything clsc in society.

Now, I'm not saying rvc need more Bill O’Reilly

own society. It helps to have a sophisticated under
standing and approach to an issue, its history, and its
contexts.

I also think members ofculrural groups are in bet-
ter positions to be critical due to their enhanced sens
sitivity (being a Muslim is handy for lambasting a lot
ofbackwards practices in the Muslim world) But the
question that most people get hung up on is whether
or not we, as outsiders, should "judge" certain cultural
aspects on their merits.l think we should.

we’re in a unique position as educated members
ofa free society to engage in a constructive discourse.
Bein<y an outsider doesn't make others’ beliefs sacro-
sanct.

To be fair, a lot of issues aren’t as
straightforward as mutilation. But that
doesn't mean that we should withhold
our nuanced criticisms

Meaningful exchange on ment is
the basis of advancement in our 500*
cry, and should become the basis for progress in oth-
ers.

Suppressing such exchange not only dulls reir
soned critique, but also insults the intelligence oforhs
