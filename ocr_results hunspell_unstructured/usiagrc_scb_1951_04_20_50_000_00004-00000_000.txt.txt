reason. Is a student who receives

Cheating methods which the
Hurricane listed as common
among students include the
excuse, where a
student'taklng a test complains
he has a bloody nose, and asks
to be excused from class for
a moment. Once outside the

Proi‘s Need Casual Dress

Akron Buchtelite, University
of Akron, reports a new way
for modern educators to knock
down formal barriers between
profs and students. Fashion ex.
perts, says the paper, suggest
the faculty dress more casually.
For instance, a prof who has an

Another Slant

The New Hampshire of New
Hampshire University in . the
last of a series of five articles
on cheating, declared: “Students
have stated that they believe
something is inherently wrong
in the University's policy ‘on
cheating ’They point to the re—
luctance of professors and line
structors to enforce cheating
regulations as an indication that
perhaps all is not well. Most
students said, ‘We don't like
this situation any better than
anyone else, but we Can’t be
expected to change cheating
practices unless the University
tells us exactly what the rules
will be This practice of
living da, byrday with no real
understanding of how'cheatersl

“Professors would like to see

class they said that cheatingl

with them throughout the next
three years as a habit." '
