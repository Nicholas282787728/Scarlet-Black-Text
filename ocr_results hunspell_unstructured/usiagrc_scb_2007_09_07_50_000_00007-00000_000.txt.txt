 

“Casa Ghetto
Sunrise" unites
band, friends

By BEN MAIN

Even though their house theme song is “Ain't No Fun" by
snoop Dog and it is currently named after a drink three parts
Olde English and one part sunny Delight, the residents of
“Casa Ghetto Sunrise" say that they are not keen on throwing
big parties. However, they still enjoy visits from neighbors and
friends.“Thete’s a ﬂow ofa lat etditrerent people,"said Robin
Cutler.

Cutler, along with Mark D'Agosuno, Chris Knap and Jeff
Wiucr, all class of'OS, are members of the wellrknown cams
pus band Vegetable Medley. Having known each other through
their band since their ﬁrst year, they decided that they wanted
to live together for their senior year in a house with a good deal
ofspace.

They found the house they
wanted in 817 Seventh AvV
errue, but ran into trouble when
the rent was a bit too much
for just the four of them. “We
found a sweet pad," said Cutler,
“and realized that the four of us
couldn't pay the rent for a nine-
person house." So they invited
four of their friends, Mike Fens
ster, Calvin Heiljng, Patrick Laine and Dhiren Patld, also all
class of'Ug, to help the ease the burden ofthe rent.

"Casa Ghetto Sunrise" is a large Tudorrstyled house that
appears wellrbuilt from the outside, but has a few quirks on
the inside.There is a roped—offtwo-t'oot-tall pile of dirt on the
patio, the basement has lights that cannot be switched off and a
pair of ﬂoodlights in the upstairs bathroom bathe the room in
a deep red glow when switched on,

The back of [l‘lC house features an extension built from a
\Ninnebago.Thc old stone back porch now leads to a corridor
ortlnnsy fakeswood patterned walls.

There is a bathroom with a shower and a sink, but no toilet.
Between the bathroom and the far bedroom, there is long gap
in the wall about two feet wide, which the residents attribute
to bad design.

Perhaps the strangest part etthe house is “The Coalmine,"

According to Wirier, it is the sort of place “where horror ﬁlms
happen” Part otthe room is occupied by a dirt pile not unlike
the pile found on the house's patio and the ﬂoor is covered in
dust and wood splinters. In the center of the room there rs a
threerfootrdeep pit with no diseernable purpose and a few dirty
pipes. “Sometimes people just come out here and think," said
Winer,“or vomit."

asset is the open-air porch in
