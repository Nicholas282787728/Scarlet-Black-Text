Inﬂuences Class of Trade in
Every Local Busi-
ness.

tiriiincil College, taken 't'rom u busi-
ness standpoint, is the city oi Griir
nell's lilggest asset in arriving at
this conclusion the indirect as well as
the dircct ways that the rollege has nix
iectcd the business oi tllr: city have
been considered.

Before the College was moved here
iroxn Davenport in 1359, the main part
at the city \v - sorrtli oi the r ilroatl
tracks. All indications were pointing
towards an extension of the city to thc
south and west, owing to better dr
age and ‘besutv. Several citizens in
vested heavily in real estate in those
sections and a low large residences
were erected. When the College Came
here the extension turned northiiard
instead of southwest, in tact, .lie
greater part or the north section or
the city is due to the College. Not only
has the College caused the movement
at the city northward but it has air
tected the price or real estate. Several
old residents assert thitt the value
.ot property has been increased to the
extent oi 25 per cent,

To a large extent the College is
responsible lor the beautiful resi-
.dences, the unusually large amount of
paving, and, in general {or the desire
able conditions of livelihood non- exr
isting here. These have, in turn, at-
tracted to Gl'lllnell a large percentage
at her population. it has been esti-
mated that about 25 per cent of her
population rs due to this cause. These
people which have been altr-actcd to
Gr-iniiell thru the inﬂuences oi the
College. help to make up, to a wry
large measure, that class or thrinr
and pr gl-cssive citizens ot which the
city oi Gl‘lllllell now boasts,

the usual lead on Drake, the entire

probably be, Lynch or Loner. center;
Tharp and n'iilits, Compton or Middle-
