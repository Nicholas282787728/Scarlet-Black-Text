lil Firsl‘ Win

By Arnie Alpert

Entering the contest as one—
touchdcwn underdogs, Grin-
liell‘s heretofore lucklessfand
coincidentally winless—gridstci-s
surprised some 1500 Monmouth
homecoming celebrants wrth a
23-13 upset win over the scots
. t Saturday. it was Grinnell's
{i l victory in seven attempts.
Another wm tomorrow over St.
Olaf, coupled with another Monr
mouth loss, will permit the Pio-
.icers at least some consolation
to.- their 1955 efforts with
avoidance of the Midwest con—

. fercnce cellar,

In winning the game, Grin-
rtcll was forced to come from
behind, previously a privilege
nilotod only to the opposition
this season, on two occasions,
P.y so doing the Pioneers dem-
onstrated a ground attack that
was both consistent and pane»
trotting and which ultimately
emerged as the deciding fac-
tor between victory and de-
reatt Two sophomore backs, I
Larry Dukes and Tom Castles,
carried the brunt of this of-
fense and scored all three

hdowns. It was Dukes' in.

nell backfield after being
switched over from and;
Castles was starting in his
second varsity game.

It was a see-saw battle
hiroughout the afternoon. Grin-
t‘tell gained a halftime lead of
9-6 only after Dukes plowed
over left tackle and over two
hionmouth linebackers for 37
of the 102 yards which he
eventually gained. Monmoulh'Sl

pass 1mm Jerry McBride to Bob
McKee after Grinnell had
drawn first blood, scoring a

Bride in bi: -n end zone. It
was MCP-l‘lde's second unsuc—
cessflll effort to move the ball
downfield after Jack Shaffer
booted a 52-yard punt, which
Went out of bounds on the Mon—
luouth one yard line.

After some colorful halftimei
homecor lig ceremonies. replete<
with the Scottish bagpipes andl
dress, the partisan crowd wasv
rewarded as Monmouth took a‘
1347 lead when Don McBride
inherited the quarterbacklng due
ties from his twin brother and
scored on a 4ryal'd run. Jerry
Mob "2 helped to set up the
tal_ with a series of four con-
secutive pass completions which
gained 39 yards, Dolllnger was
successful this time with the

'This joy, however, was
rather short-lived. Pour min-
utes later in the last quarter, l
halfback Castles dashed 40
yards along the right side<
lines on a douhlcereverse to
give (irinnell a 16-13 margin, ,
*one which it never relinquisll- '
ed. The game was “iced” with
just a little more than two
ritinutcs remaining as Dukes
capped a 741mm] drive with a ;
tworyhrd touchdown plunge \
off right tackle. Shaffer added
his third extra point, making-

he final score 23713, Grin-
nell's largest point output this
season No better illustration
of this lies in the fact that
nukes, with two touchdowns
against Monmouth his first of
the season. is second only to

Shaffer. with 32 points, in in—
dividual scoring.

The Pioneer line did as To!"
mjdable a job as the backfield
once again despite minor injur-
ics to tackler Gary Nolder, Bob
Carothcrs and one of a more
serious nature to center Bob
Grind v John Lai-ew and Bruce
Wilke on. in particular, turned‘
in impressive defensive perfor—
mances.

Coach Bob Peterson cleared
his bench after the third Pine»
aeer touchdown and virtually
the entire squad saw action. End
Brad Sagen cliinaxed a iii-seer

Griunoll will be seeking their

The Northficld eleven have
been strong contenders for the
conference crown in recent
years They boast a well-hal—

“T” offense patterned after
that of the professional Chi»

is paced by two very capable
ball carriers, Brekken at full-
back and Brown at one of the
halfback posts, in the line the
squad is rongy and fast with
several men deep in all posi—
tions. st. olaf's depth, a vital
factor in modern football, is
attributable to the fact that

there are 1300 students an»

spot, Dukcs. a fullback last year
on the freshman squad, was
summoned for emcrgcncy duty

"fiom his usual end position last

week due to the iniury of Gary

performance as he scored twice.

Peterson expects to use
about 25 men during Satur-
day’s game. He pointed out
that “every team has a co—
minute ball player: ours is
John Litrewi We substitute to
give our boys a breather at
all positions Many fans are
not aware that we are using
an offensive and defensive
platoon,”

Eight Grinnclhans will be
playing their last game Satur—

day. Carcaptaills John Larew
and Dick Thomas head the list
of seniors which also includes
ends Bob Clem and Brad Sagen,

will be tough to fill their shoes

valuable new year. The team
is up for this game and you
