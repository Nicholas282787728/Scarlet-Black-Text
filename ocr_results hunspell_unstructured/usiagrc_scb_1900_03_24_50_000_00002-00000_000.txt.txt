THE DEGREE ordaining Compulr
sory chapel attendance, which was
issued on Friday morning, has
been the cause of Considerable
consternation among the students,
'and especially among lhosc who
have been in the habit of dispens~
ing with that necessary adjunct to
our college life, We are not in
favor of compulsory chapel ate
tendance, but it seems that in this
case the action of the faculty is
justiﬁed. It cannot be denied that
the conditions on which attend-
ance at chapel was left to the dis-
cretion of the students have been
violated repeatedly by those to
whose interest it was to see that
they were kept. and furthermore,
it is true that the average number
present at chapel during the last
few weeks has not been all that
could be desired. But while we
recognize that compulsory chapel
is only what might have been ex-
pected, we hope that there may be
no necessity for its long continu~
ance. The plan of voluntary
chapel attendance has been so suc-
cessful in the past, that we fully
believe that a return to it \vlll be
advisable after the memory of the
students has been refreshed a little
by the adoption of tlle present
system.

Summer School in Wisconsin.

There is no more vital and 1in
ing science than the science of
getting a living; there is no study
that touches life more closely
than the study of the dealings of
men. and learning how men should
live together.

It is with pleasure we learn
that the department oi economics
and sociology of the University of
Wisconsin has arranged for a
summer session from July 2 to
Aug. n, rgoo. This school of

economics is fast becoming the

most popular in the west and
offers a splendid opportunity for
students to do work in that de-
partment. Courses are open both
to graduate and under-graduate
students for which both Ullivers
sity and college credits are given,
50 candidates for degrees and
those wishing to make up‘worlc in
that department for any reason,
have an excellent opportunlty.

This school is doubly intCI testing
to Iowa College students bccanse
our own Professor Macy has been
secured as instructor in Political
Science. No word that .lve can
say will add anything to his popus
larity and already well sustained
reputation. but we are delighted
to know that the University has
made so wise a choice in seculing
Professor Macy.

Dr. Meyer offers two courses.
viz: r. The Elements of Eco-
nomic Science; 2. Transporta-
tion, Prot. Scott. who is acting
professor of Economic History
and Theory in the University,
offers two courses, Vlz: 1. Money
and Banking; 2. Economics since
John Stuart Mill. Professor Ely,
who needs no introduction to the

American Public, \vill conducttwo
classes. One will be in Public
Finance, and the other will take
up the subject of Monopolles and
Trusts. Prof. Giddings gives a
course in the elements of Socior
logy, and another in advanced
American Sociology,

There are nine courses in all.
taking up the most advanced lines
oteconoinicthought. Thellhiary
of the University is excellcnt and
is essential to the pursuit of such
studies. We wish [or the school
an' unbounded success, and are
conﬁdent that those who attend
will make no mistake.

The students of the University
of Minnesota are at present tak-
ing a great deal of interest in pole
itlcs. and are being rapidly divide
ed on the question,”Imperialism,”
or “Anthimperialism.” Some
weeks ago an “Anti-imperialist”
club was organized. This aroused
the friends of expansion, and now
an lmperialist club hlls been
formed.
