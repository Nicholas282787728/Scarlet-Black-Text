Psych dept. requests new prof

by Kim Eckart
In its upcoming proposal to
the administration. the
psychology department will
request a fifth faculty member to
‘balance its load as one of the
most popular and crowded
departments on campus
According to General Science
Department Chairman Thomas
Brozoski, the psychology deparlr
ment is the smallest in the
science division. The large
number of students enrolled in
psychology courses forces an
obvious demand for more
sections and more faculty
members. "Within our present
faculty size. we can't implement
more sections." said Brozoski.
The proposal, which must be
submitted by Sept.

signed to fulfill, rather than ex-
pand. the curricular program.
According to psychology
Educational Policy Committee
Chairwoman Julie Hutton, the
department hopes for a
social/personality psychology
professor. The professor would
leach those classes which are
listed in the catalog but have not
been offered in yous, )ecause ofa
faculty shortage. "la order to
cover all these classes that
students want. we need another
professor," said Hutton.

Some students complain that
because of the large classes,
speciﬁcally in the general and
abnormal psychology sections,
the department is not providing
the students with the personal

education Grinnelt strives for.
"The professor hasn't even made
an effort to learn names," said a
general psychology student.

Students describe the depart-
ment's method of identifying
students by social security
number as impersonal and typical
of a large university. The
absence of makeup tests is also a
concern, "If you miss a test. you
get a zero. That‘s it," said one
student

According to Brozoski, it is
the size of these classes that
necessitates computerized
treatment. He emphasized ,
however. that the size of the
classes in laboratory discussions
is limited to provide a more
personal environment. The lack
of makeup tests allows for
immediate feedback on exams and
enables the student to learn the
correct answers. said Brozoski.

Students also question the
department's focus on research
rattler than clinical psychology.
"The deparu'ncnt emphasizes . .
. research, because grad schools
prefer research and experimental
background," said Hutton.

Associate Professor David
Lopatto agrees. "The department
is sensitive to the professional
goals of students, so we prepare
them for graduate school.“ Re»
views of college psychology de-
partments nationwide reveal that
undergraduates cannot effectively
perform clinical practice. so it is
difficult to have undergraduates in
a clinical practice program, said
Lopatto.

The strong foundation in the
scientiﬁc basis of psychology has
provided successful results in
clinical fields "We have received
positive feedback from alumni,"
said Brozoski.

Open forum

reﬂecting the concerns of the
students. Many students spoke
of the need for better lighting on
and off campus. and for outdoor
phones in town and on campus.
Both Crady and Boyer were re-
ceptive to the suggestions and
said they would look into it.
Several times during the dis-
cussion, Crady and Boyer re-
quested that all cases of harass-
ment be reported even if the
victim has no intention of taking
action against the harasscr.
Crady Said that the Office of
Student Affairs would start
keeping a log of all cases reported
not only to get a better idea of
the scope of the problem, but
also to dctmtcasc patterns.
Escort Service
Another frequently mentioned
idea was the institution of an es-
cort service. Evans said that in
the past, escort services have
failed because they have been
underused. It was suggested that

Dining Services publishes
employee regulations

by Brendan Shepherd
Dining Services has
developed and distributed a
student employee handbook
describing student rc-
sponsibilltics. employee dis-
missals and grievance procedures.
David McConnell. director of
Dining Services, said the hand
book covers “things that have al-
ready been in effect." He said that
"virtually nothing" has changed.
It was dleribulcd to the almost
100 freshmen who work at the
dining halls at an orientation held
earlier this semcstcr. McConnell
explained that upperclassmcn
workers dill not receive the hand
book because they already know

the details of the job.
Information covered includes

sanitation, attendance.
periods and time clocks.

"(These are) common sense
types of things." McConnell
said. The guidelines were "put
into writing so they are much
clearer to everyone," he said.
McConnell said the development
of the handbook is not a result of
any difficulties with student
employees in the past.
McConnell explained that
freshmen have a lot on their
minds at the beginning of the
year, and that the things discussed
at the employee orientations are
often forgotten. "We felt we‘d
give something more formal," he
said.

Evans also mentioned the

Anyone intercstcd in being on the
committee should send their

Police Protection

Several students expressed
doubts about the ability of the
police to provide protection for
students. Ashley Abel asked
about the police's policy
concerning sexual preference
harassment, saying that she had
been a victim of such
harassment. Abel said that
although the police had been
provided with both a description
of the offender and the license
plate of the car involved,
apparently no action had been
taken. Boyer did not know what.
if any, progress had been made on

the case.

Boyer said that the prOlCC'th
the police can give is limited:
there are 12 members on the
force, only two of which arc on
duty at a time. Jessica Weiscl
expressed concern that foot
patrols in residential
neighborhoods are not enough
prolcctioii. Dave Jones suggested
Lhat the college should play a
more active role in protecting the
students. Crady replied that the
students should take a more
active role in protecting
themselves by taking
precautionary measures such as
not propping dorm doors open
after they have been locked.

Andre Fresco said that men
on campus are sympathetic with
the women and want to help.
"We feel for you.,,tltcre is no
point in causing more pain, If
we can get over this problem
togethc ...we can only benefit
from this situation; we'll be safer
and stronger."
