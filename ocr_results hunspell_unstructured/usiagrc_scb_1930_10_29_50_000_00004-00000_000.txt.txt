Ruff’s Passes
Give Grinnell
14-13 Victory

Carletnn Loses Homecoming
Contest as Broberg's

Plunge Fails

By DAVID MATCHETT
(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

NORTHFIELD, MINN.~Featuring
a splendid passing attack led by Ruff,
brilliant beaver, and some great line
plunging by Capt. Ben Douglas, Grin-
nell's scarlet and black machine dash-
ed the hopes of Carleton by a 14 to
13 score before a large crowd of
Homecomers here Saturday. Henry
Thomas, on the receiving end of most
of Ruff‘s tosses. played a brilliant
game to aid his teammates in a hard-
earned victory.

Opening the game with a seconds
string backﬁeld, the Crinneilians
made their ﬁrst threat of the game
when Murphy blocked Remington’s
punt on the Carl 10 yard line. Th:
Pioneers drove their way to the 2
yard line, where they were stopped
by a determined maize defense.

Spinners Fool Carleton

For the rest of the ﬁrst quarter
the game was a punting dual between
Remington and Ullrich, the latter
having slightly the better of the ar-
gument, although he was kicking
against the wind.

Grinnell's first string backfield en—
tered the game after the second per-
iod opened. The Carleton iine was be-
ing consistently fooled by the spinner
plays of the scarlet and black team,
but Ruff‘s passes seemed for the
time unable to make connections.

Finally, however, Thomas got clear
in the ﬁat, taking a pass from Ruff.
who threw from the as yard line. and
eluded the Carl hacks for a touch-
down. Douglas kicked goal.

Douglas Mllkes Second Score

Grinnell kicked off, the ball being
recovered after it had rolled 10 yards.
A short pass over the line of scrim-
mage made 15 yards. Ruff passed to
Thomas, who made ﬁrst down on the
Carleton 31 yard mark. Failing to
gain, Douglas printed outside on the
maize 2 yard stripe. Remington
promptly kicked to the 38 yard 'line.

a pass from Ruff to Ullrich landed
the ball on the 2 yard line again,
from where Douglas, on a spinner
play, dove off the Carl right guard
for the second score. After he had
kicked goal, Douglas was replaced by

Plus Nets Touchdown

The Pioneers again kicked off. Af-
ter several plays had failed to gain,
Remington, standing on his own 20
yard line, shot a long forward pass
to Nordly who outran the Crinnell
secondary to score the ﬁrst tcnclr
down for the Carls. Thoeny promptly
booted a goal from piacement for the
extra point. The score remained 14
to 7 at the half.

The play in the second half saw
both teams threatening. At one time
Carleton reached the Grinnell 10
yard line, but was halted when Rem-
ington’s pass was knocked down he-
hind the scarlet and black goal.

Curls start Drive

Later Crinnell reached the Carl 4
yard stripe, when Remington's punt
was blocked on the Carleton 38 yard
mark. Nordly interfered with Thomas
as the latter was attempting to catch
a pass from Ruff. The threat failed
when Thoeny knocked down Ruff‘s
pass over the goal line.

Starting immediately thereafter on
their own 20 yard line, the Carls be—

gan a determined drive led by Ero-
berg and Seewald through the iine.
1n the course of this drive the Carls
mixed two long passes with line
bucks to plant the ball on the Grin-
nell three yard line. from where Bro-
berg hit right guard for a touchdown.

Christofferscn Plays Well

Instead of kicking for the extra
point, the Carls sent Broherg off
Grinnell's right guard again, but he
was turned back, saving a victory for
Crinnell. The game ended shortly
thereafter.

Throughout the game the play of
Douglas, Ruff, ullrich, and Thomas
in the Grinnell backﬁeld was out
standing. The Grinnell line played
very well offensively, the work of
Christofferseu at center being par-
ticularly noteworthy. Minier and
Murphy at ends played headsup foot-
ball at all times.

Broberg was the leading light for
the Carls, ably assisted by Reming-
ton and Thoeny. Spu‘rbeck was at all
times the most outstanding in the
line, being in on every play.
