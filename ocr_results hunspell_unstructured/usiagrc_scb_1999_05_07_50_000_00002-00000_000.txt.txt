"THE IDIOTS IMRAMAZOV” BY
CHRISTOPHER DURAN G AND

ALBERTINNAURATO
FLANAGAN THEATRE

The deposed monkey king pres
pares to ﬁght his successor. The two
square offas the drum beats and the
instruments chime. The ﬁght is
slow, controlled. It reouires
strength. Valerichtter confers with
her husband Roger. The dancers
stop. Ir is a rehearsal for the up-
coming Javanese Dance and
Gamelan Spring Concert.

The groups will give a [nation
mance Saturday May a, at 8 pm. in
the Sebring-Lewis Recital Hall in
the Bucksbaum Fine Arts Center.

The concert will begin with a
solo character dance by Alison
Novak ‘Ol . The dance is in the "rec
fined male style" which emphasizes
“selfcontrolled inner strength” For
Mr. Vetter, the director of the
Gamelan. “It is a beautiful dance
which never fails to make me happy
as 1 dance it," said Novak.

Then the dancers will present a
piece ofthe traditional Javanese rec
interpretation of the Indian epic of
Ramayana, a myth. The Garnelan
will play the accompaniment for the
dances and present their own pieces.

The Verters, who have spent 27
years studying Javanese arts, will be
on leave next year. As a result. this
concert may be the lasr opportunity
studentswill have to experience this
unique art form for a year and a half,

Students participating in both
groups stress the differences berween
Javanese and wcsrern music and
dance. “It’s nothing like western
music. It's a rorally different tun-
ing system and much different
structure,” explained Alex Rosenthal
‘00, a member ofrhe Gamelan who
also participates in the Jazz Band.
Mr. Vetter agrees that it is entirely
differenr from western dance with
its “slow controlled movement with
a lot ofemphasis on the articulation
of the hands and arms and head."

In addition,
the costuming

costumes will be
”exquisite," ac.
cording to Novak
who added that

so complicated she
needed someone

described them as
“spectacular" and
“other worldly."

Novak considers her dance classes
“the highlight of [her] week. After-
wards, [she] always feelis] energized
and yet calm. Dancing can be very
meditative." For Hormuz Earliboi
‘00, dancing “is a form of expres-
sion. It’s really artistic which is what
I like.” Hisako Watanabe ‘02, a
dancer who lived in Indonesia for
seven years, finds the groups
“ama1ing...l didn’t expect to dance

Although Mr. vetter describes

enyoys the chance to get to know
students better than he can in the
classroom because orsharing work
on a collaborative proycct. Camelan
is “very gratifying by the time we get
to the end or the semester and we
can put together a decent product
which audiences have seemed to en-
joy."

He believes rhat students rerurn
to the Camel an each year because

of “a sense of community that de-
velops in the group along with the
challenges they feel learning this
new musical language."

Ms. Vetter enjoys her work with
“enthusiastic and conscientious"
students. She enjoys matching
people to characters and ‘fteaching
them movement they've never seen
before" which ranges from ”slow re-
served to energetic exuberant"
movements they may not expect.
She feels that she teaches them [0
undersrand another culture through
movement. It is challenging because
American students are not accus-
tomed to sitting on the ﬂoor or up
ing their feet as the Javanese might.

We admit it. We’re big enough to admit it. We
left this campus in a lurch last week. What could
you base your movie decisions on without our ex-
pert advice and counseling? Ifrhis is true, then it’s
rime for you so get a life. Make your own damn
movie decisions~w€te iust here to tell you how
much beer to drink before going (and we’re sure you
really donr need us to tell you that, either).

After a two-week hiatus, SGA Films has brought
back an Oscar nominated film. And are we glad
they did! Honestly, ire/rived wasn’t really tops on
our “must rent" list. There's jusl something abour a
three-hour feature starring a partially nude Oprah
Winfrey that makes us ask, “Do you still have Tie
Rage lying around up thctc?” But now we get to
review die best films ofthe year. Ifyou were to ask
any reviewer, this is our World Series.

A: This is every British History teachers favor.
ire movie. We get to see all the major players in
England during the Virgin Queen's reign, from

: Mary, Queen ofScots to Sir WalrerRaleigh. The

sets are amazingly accurate. The story moves along
at a nice pace, and british court life is porrrayed as
more trashy than we are led to believe inany history
class.

c: Now rhar Aaron has stopped talking out of
his ear, I will tell you what this movie is actually
about. Eliaabeth is supposedly the “Virgin Queen",
but this movie tells a slightly different story It is

really a love story between Queen Elizabeth and the
character portrayed by horrie Joe Ficnnes of
Slukﬂpmre In Law fame. I am not sure how true
this story is, bur it is an enjoyable one nonetheless.
The srory, real or ﬁctional, is really quite sad (for
lack ofa better adjective) and is only one of three
movies that broke through my icy demeanor this
year. I know all you men out there are groaning at
the mention ofa "love story", but the movie is very
fast paced and should keep you entertained. I don’t
remember looking at my watch once while I watched
this one, so that must mean something (maybe I
wasn’t wearing a watch). Also, she costumes were
gorgeous which only added to the movie's appeal.

A: Now, I must comment here. The fact that
every review I've read describes the costumes as “gor—
geous" makes me cringe. Most costume movies suck.
N0 plot, yust some nice pctticoals. But this one ac-
tually had some substance beyond the corsets.

C: It had some substance IN the corsets, too.
Nudge, nudge. Wink, wink.

A: Speaking as a guy, I found this movie cnioy-
able, Ofcourse, maybe that’s because I'm also a his-
tory major.

C: Well, as a psych major who despises history,
I thought this movie was damn good.

And that’s all I have to say about that.

I‘m sure you have all heard of WogeieDog by
now. Iris the story ofan American president in
trouble over allegations of sexual misconduct
who has a fake war produced to save his ap-
proval ratings. Sound a little bit familiar?

The president is not the predominant char.
acter however, as are film follows his special com—
mittee that produces the war to save his image
by distracting the American public.

Al Pacino is the head ofthis committee with
his righth'and woman in crime, Anne Heche.
They employ a down—on.his.Iuck Hollywood
producer (Dustin Hoiiman) to invent current
news footage on the war,

Ironically enough, the war is in Albania
(which happens to border Kosovo where there is
currently a war involving an Albanian papula»
ticn.) In addition, rhewar comes complete with
a hero, an anonymous psychotic criminal (Woody
Harrelson), With the exception of Woody
Harrclson's character that I found too cliched,
this all-star cast is notable insofar as they carry
offthe script well.

Those ofyou atrracted to conspiracy theories
will probably be entertained, as the films entirety
is about a little room of people pulling strings,
manipulating the public. I think the film is more
promising than a simple conspiracy story how-
ever, as it offers an interesting critique of mod.
em media and politics, both being highly pro»
duced afrairs,

To this end, I encourage you to take advan.
tage of the full efreers rhat this film’s sarire will
have on you and go after the movie to watch five
minutes of CNN news, I promise it will pro.

you watch it immediately afterwards.
