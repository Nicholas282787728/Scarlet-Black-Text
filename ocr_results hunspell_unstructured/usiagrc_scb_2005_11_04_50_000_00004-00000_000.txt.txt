Pat Green '09 bust: a mom during Hip Hop Eltmmltz
on Monday. BRYAN BOYCE

Bv SARAH MIRK

“I don't think my neighbors like me too much,"
Paul Baleman ’07 said as two giant Harris speak-
ers blared beam to a mostly empty auditorium this
Monday. Bateman has been [>ng since last April
and now provides the two turntables for Monday
night Hiprﬂop Elementz.

Grinnell’s hip-hop group formed at the begin-
ning of the second semester last year, initiated by
several students and the now-departed German
language assistants love of the music. The group
started hosting weekly hip-hop get-togethers, call—
ing the informal gatherings “Elementzr” At ﬁrst,
Elementz members played hipshop offofCDs and
hung out and listened to in This semester, aspiring
Djs are welcome to scratch on Bateman's turntables
and, soon, there will be a collegc»provided set. “It'll
be a lrttle bit of everything, usually all at once,"
Batemnn said. “Usually someone will dance, and
someone will scratch Someone will beatbox, and
someone will rup."

Delwin Pinkins loo grew up with hipshop. “My
father had turntables back then. because he would
listen to the eighttrmck in the Cadillac.”Then, his
parents banned hip~hop’s orrcnsive song lyrics from
his house.The ban put him on hiatrrs from hipshop
and rap until the eighth grade, when he met some
kids who would hang out and rap.

“They just challenged me, put me on the micro
phone and just told me, ‘Comc up with something,”
Pinkins said. “I just started coming up with things
in my life, problems in my life, and from then I just
started freestyling,y‘ust doing my thing,”

This year, Pinkins wants the hipshop club to
branch out to more Grinnellians in order to raise
awareness about what he considers a misconception
surrounding hip—hop.

“The hip-hop they don't like is the commercial—
ized hip-hop, the commercialized rap," he said. “A
lot of people just listen to the beat, not the words."

Branching out includes starting a website, a
grafﬁti wall in Harris for artists and even meeting
with Russell K. Osgood to invite him to attend El—
ementz as an honorary guest (Osgood cancclled at
the last minute)

This Monday, while some of the group toyed
with beats on the turntables or sat nodding their
heads along to the beat, Rico Howard ‘09 leaned
against the stage, typing on his laptop. Howard
started making bears on his comput as a sophOs
more in high school and now fills hi iTunes playi-
ists with songs of his own creation.

“1 should be doing my homework when I’m
doing this but, you know," he said, clicking on a
mick called “Nostalgia.” “Croat iry comes out of
nowhcrc. Sincc I can’t use the gurbilge can outside
to makc noisc,l usc lhis."“Nost-algia” began piping
from the computer speakers with a few slow notes
from r piano, the sound ofﬁngcr-snapping coming
in on the beat and causing Kali Otttrsenrry'og to
laugh: “You love tlll: snaps.”

Neither Hownrd nor Otto-Gentry wcr-c nervous
about moving to Iown, whcr-c good hiprhop can he
scarcefl‘hcy both rcrncmbcrctl niccring tl'll: hrp—hop

Town’s unassuming community gallery exhibits much more than kids’ drawings

scci'crwcllrkcpt from most college studcnt lhcy may
have passcd it on rhc way from the Chrystal Center-
to tho rarnrcr’s Murkcr brrt probably never dar-cd to
venture in the door. If they did ﬁnd the nerve Oi cu~
riosity to intrude on this cxoscollcgc art zone, they
would lravc had to go through the front door, takc the
door labcicd “juvenile court services" and “art gantry"
across the lobby on the right, go up the strircasc with
the garish orange barrister, take another right and stop
at the door with the “Art Gallery” sign in front orit.

The illustrious gallery itselfis a single nurmw room
with one greeting desk and a collapsible chair. The
drawings are hung with a casualncss few large galler-
ies could conceive. Ordinary, nondescript thumbtacks
are stuck straight through frameless pieces of note-
book paper into the yellowing walls.

Finding artistic gems in this ordinarytlooking lirt
Lle room might be difﬁcult to imagine, but the world
has a way of hiding pleasant surprises in unexpected
places.

Anyone who stumbled into the tiny gallery before
Oct. 27 would have found themselves surrounded by
the enigmatic paintings and sketches of artist and
writer Therese Murdza. One side of the room was
devoted to her recent work: queer and colorful paints
ings, featuring round, ﬂul abstract shapes and su —
real pears plopped onto intensely bright and whimsi-
cal backgrounds. On the other wall resided her older
sketches, including many cryptic charcoal drawings,
referred to as “biographical maps," that feature sharp,
severe slashes and squares arranged in mysterious pat-
terns across the page.

Today, the gallery switches to the opposite end of
the nbstrnCr—rcpresenmtlonal spectrum With a photog—
raphy exhibit, featuring the work orMark schncidcr,
Physics. The show will focus mainly on landscapes
from locations as diverse as tho Rocky Mountains, Jar
pan and schncidcr's own front yard, However, one or
two of Schneider's pieces wtll venture into the realm
ofweird photography, using “tricks" to distort the irris
age rn surreal ways.

on jun. r, and Fob, 3, thc gallery will exhibit artist
Joc Lacinu's drawings, prrnrrngs and watercolors from
the Grinnell College collection, i'cspccrlvcly. orrc
of the yearly highlights for the gailcry will be from
March through May. when elementary, middle and
highrschooi smdcntt wrll display their work.

According to chair of the council for thc gallery,
Dan Ferro, “A lot of people come out to those [CXT
hibilions] because their kids are involved," and many
people learn about the gallery through these shows,

Ferro says that the gallery is fairly welltknown in
the wider Grinncll community, mainly because ofthe

the gallcry is still largely unknown on campus.

However, Ferro hopes to change thatin the future
by making morc inrormarion available to thc student
body, and, according to Murdzrt, the committee is also
considering having Gtinnell College students exhibit
their work sometime in the future. Ferro would also
like to get students involved by having a college stun
dent on the art gallery committee.
