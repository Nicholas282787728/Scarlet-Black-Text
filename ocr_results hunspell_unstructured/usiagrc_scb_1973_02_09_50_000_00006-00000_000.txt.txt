Rich History, Rich Sound

by Dave crow

“No matter how many times you
have practiced a piece, no matter
how closely you perlorm it belore
an audience you see something new,
always diiierent,”

Thus says Oscar Ghiglia, who has
spent most at the past ten years
as a touring classicalguitarist. Last
week he came to Grinnell, It was
evident that the special [arm of
communication between artist and
audience that Ghiglia seeks was pre
sent,

This Communication started in
1963. In that year, Ghiglia took first
prize in a competition in classical
guitar held by ORTF, the French
radio and television network, After»
wards, he started touring, ﬁrst in
Europe, then in the MidrEast, then
America and the Far East. When
not touring, he teaches at various
American universitites during the
summer months. He himseli stud-
ied at the Conservatory of Rome
under such masters as Segovia and
Diaz. He has recorded eight LP’s,
three of which are solo recordings
available in America on the Angel
label.

Ghiglia spoke of the development
of his instrument and its music,
noting that it originated with gyp—
sies in the Andalusian portion of
Spain. The guitar used in their
flamenco was quite small and had
only iour strings

The guitar spread and improved:
Louis XIV took it up, and so, nat-
urally‘,‘ did sell‘respecting French
courtiers and imitators. The guitar
grew to have six courses ottwo str--
ings each, somewhat like the mod—
ern twelve»string, although tuned

diIIerently, It was not until early
in this century that it reached its
present state, becoming larger,
deeper and stronger in an eitort
to give more volume while retain-
ing its distinct sound.

Still, the instrument is a quiet
one, and as such appeals to a par
ticular type or individual, and lits
with a certain lamily ol musical
styles. it is, remarked Ghiglia,
completely different from the ”pop”
guitar, which is an extroverted and
purely personalistic instrument, He
maintains that the classical guitar,
despite its limited dynamic resourr
sources, is capable oi reproducing
as wide a range of tone colors asan
entrie orchestra. This mightprompt
Wagnerians to quote something inn
sidious about the Italian conception
oi the orchestra. But Berlioz and
Debussy both played the guitar; Here
lioz played nothing else, conceiving
his works in terms of the guitar.

Music, Ghigllo observed, is not so
much a profession as a way oi liIe.
It is a ditlicult one, demanding a high
degree of seltrdiscipline. But it has
the rewards that the successiulperr
iormance otters.

Ghiglia likened that perlormance
to an exam. You have either pre—
pared ior it or not, but in any case
as you begin it (ii all goes well)
things seem to jell and you find
yoursell using resources which you
did not think you had before. Out
oi this comes a sense at newness
and vitality. It is this vitality, this
drive to excel that makes the per-
formance interesting and worth-
while. Ii it is lost, Ghiglia said,
it is time to retire, but as long as
there is the drive, there is always
the potential of doing better.

lsrlltc Presents
Health Bill Study

by Curt Gorrell

The iowa Student Public interest
Research Group recently presented
to the state Senate Human Relations
committee a study entitled "A Sec-
ond Look at Our HMO Legislation."

The study, which criticizes the
Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO) bill which came to the ﬂoor
or the Senate February 3, says that
the bill is “overly concerned with
the interests of insurance compan-
ies." The study was presented to
the Senate committee prior to a
meeting on Tuesday, February 6.

ISPIRG proposed 12 amendments
to the Iowa measure in the body 01
its live page paper. Duringthe com-
mittee session, Senator William
Giulia (DrDavenport) asked At-
torney Steve Grossman, the tea-
tured speaker, to direct hiS atten-
tion to the ISPIRG report, request-
ing his comments on the {allow-
ing amendment:

“The governing body oi any HMO
may include providers, other indiv-
iduals or both, but shall consist at
at least one third enrollees. The
said governing body shall provide
a reasonable method lcr altering
enrollees an opportunity to parti—
cipate in matters oi policy and op~
oration,”

Grossman stated that he was ”all

tor" bringing in consumers, espec~
ially the enrollees. Looking at an—
other amendment, however, he would
make no definite statement on
ISPIRG’S recommendation that age
should not be considered a basis
ior establishing charges for HMO
services.

Communication Problems

told the Ser this week, because of
“the problems or the collection sys-

“The basic question still remains:
what is a proiessional stall tor?"
Ms: Wynn said. “I maintain that it"
is to guide student projects and to
provide certain expertise that the
typical undergraduate dues not have.
Due to the previously poor returns
(from individual students) and the
action at ISU, the stall will have to
be cut.

"It will actually serve as a great
test to determine whether students
are as deeprseatedly apathetic as
they seem to be," she added, “or
whether they merely need an op—
portunity to take responsiblity and '
do something ior interests beyond
the narrowly deﬁned ivory tower."
