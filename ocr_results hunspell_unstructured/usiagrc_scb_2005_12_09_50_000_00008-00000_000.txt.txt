Finals week fun

Enjoy your time at college, and

A movie was recently advertised on a campus
ﬂyer with the following riglinc: “Do you need to
escape from the internally tortuous lifCrconsuming
monster known as Hell Week?"

I'll answer the tlycr's query
with one otmy own: “Do we need
to be surrounded by peers and
ﬂyers informing. us that the last
weeks of school, due to academic
deadlines in great abundance, will
be the most un-enjoyable and de-
pressionrinducing weeks of the
year?”

And now I’ll answer my re-
sponse to the initial question with a declarative
statement: “No."

Because I think that the Grinnell mentality that
I-lell Week and iinals week must be excruciatingly
painail is horrendously
misguided.

That we so often as—
sociate the end of the se-
incstCt with “This Sticks"
that we deprive ourselves
of experiences that could
have otherwise been very
enjoyable.

My lowest manifestation ofthis unnecessary der
privation of joy occurred over Thanksgiving “Break."
frhar Saturday, I went to Chicago
with my family to see the holiday
lighting displays, but had difficulty
allowing myselr to have tun.

How was I supposed to enjoy a
magical, light—filled evening with
loved ones when I had my glaring-
ly empty study abroad application
sitting crossrlegged in my mind
on a little barstool held together
with silver nails and generalized anxiety?

When my dad saw my pouting lower lip, he
turned to me and said, “You know Erin we only
get so many of these moments,"

Before 1 could accuse my father of ripping his
comment from a script for a maderforrTVrmovie
on the Hallmark Channel, a sob enipted from my
throat, and I began to cry in shame.

How could I, the girl whose Norton Antholr
ogy of English Literature is almost always in hand,
forget what Shakespeare, Herrick and Marvell have
been suggesting through iambs for centuries: That
life is, in fact, ﬂeeting?

How could 1 allow (yer again) my seemingly hell-
sent academic woes to interfere with my enjoyment
of other positive aspects of my life?

That’s right, folks. Life is short. And our time
in college is considerably shorter. Which means we
shouldn’t spend our Grinnell experience envisioning
ptofessors jabbing metaphorical pitchforks into our
already overcxtcnded cerebral cortexes, lighting our
dreams for relaxation on fire and then laughing ma»
niacaliy as they watch the ashes ofourjoyous desires
ﬂutter skyward with a gust of sulfurous wind. We
need to enjoy ourselves, finals or not.

And we can’t wait. Don't give me any of those

Lel’s slay that ”in

life-consuming monster,” bum

benealn rile [ii/tie name.

On We way in your finals, make up

rejoice! I’m entering Noyce! ”

quit making things so stressful

“wellljusr need to get through finals and then I can
relax" excuses.

This “getting through" mentality is a very danger—
ous one and, when carried our excessively can lead
us to waking up one day, discovers
ing we’re at the final strokes ofthe
college clock and realizing we’ve
spent [on many days stressing out
and too few days having conversas
rions with fantastic individuals on
the many campus benches.

Having tun under pressure is
no easy task. I'll admit that writs
ing two papers and studying for
four comprehensive examsin the span otrour days is
not an ideal way to spend our time.

But neither is wallowing in our own seltrpity her
cause our workloads seem impossible to surmount.

We always do manage,
don’t we? So this finals
week, let's try something
new. Let's slay that "ire
fernally tortuous life-con-
suming monster,” burn its
corpse and bury its vese
tiges beneath the Zirkle
statue. Then, let’s dance on the grave. Then, let’s
have some fun.

I don't care what time ofyear it is, or how "full of
sorrow" (another gem from a cams
pus ﬂyer) I’m supposed to reel.

Some suggestions for fun that
can coincide with academic presr
sures;

On the way to your finals,
make up an inspirational say-
ing about the academic buildings
such as “Let’s rejoice! I’m enterr
ing Noycei“ and “Things will be
Good Now that I’m about to take my anthro fl‘
nall" Compete with your classmates for the wirtiest,
rhymeiest onel

Every time you use a computer in one of the
labs, change the desktop to a picture that makes you
laugh. Better yet, change your friend’s background
when he or she takes a bathroom break.

i've found mat a picture of Krang, that pink-
brained villain from Teenage- Mutant Ninja Tint/cl,
is always a delight.

Leave anonymous romantic haikus on your
fricnds'dryrcrase boards, like:

“All ofthe ice cream _

in the world cannot surpass

Your cute awkward smile."

See? Fun! Fun during finals!

There’s no need to accuse me of being naive or
overly optimistic. I'm a hot little potato right now;
I'm extremely stressed out, too. BUT 1 do believe
that through our sleepless nights and bursts of frusr
tration, we can experience joy, have some fun and
relish in the power oramrzing friends.

Don’t let any ﬂyer or anxietyeridden classmate
try to convince you otherwise. So next week, let’s
work on taking the hell out ofGrinnell.And putting
the “grin"back in.

Winter wish list targets

While other campus publications scram-
ble to get ﬁnal issues to the printer, the 5553
staff has been drinking cider and decorating
sugar cookies. We even made our own wish
list. Enjoy.

1) Biggcr cup; in Quad. The, rationale was
understandable. As part of the college's antir
smoking campaign, Dining Services decided
to make cups at (brad proportional to the av-
erage South Campus hipsters lung capacity
Since smokers have now learned their lesson,
can we make their drinking vessels propor-
tional to their egos, again?

2) Liberation 0f Harri: armor/i. Armed

with pretentious characters and boring plots,
French terrorists have occupied Harris for long
enough. We call on Santa to commence opere
ation Harris Freedom immediately to liberate
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes and a
ﬂeet of fanged monsters from the oppressive
berated regime.

3) A Medea aurride aanrkriaam. Science
majors need to work on nights and weekends.
Art, Drama and Music majors: who are you
trying to fool? With all the drama in these
departments, a jukebox outside ofBucksbaum
would be more useful than a P-Card reader,
anyway. There is no war among tenured profs
that Bon Jovi couldn't ﬁx. Plus, now when you
step out of the building and your stuff is locked
inside, at least you can dance to keep warm.

4) N W’: "F“ (/1: Palm” in Judy Matbzrly’:
trotting. Grinnell Police Chief Jody Matherly
would like students to report all parties to him
so that the police department can be properly

prepared. After arresting a student {or a Plans
posting, breaking up multiple strident gath-
erings and making marijuana is big deal, we
question whether students ratting each other
out before the party even gets started would be
in our best interest (even though surprise party
busts make for juicy news). Only NWA’s old
school hit can properly capture our response to
Matherly’s request.

5) Reparaﬁanrﬂrxmivrr. seniors have been
straight up jacked. Four years of steep tuition
increases, and in return they get: endless con-
smiction, violent construction workers and
a gay rights group crammed into a closet in
Loose. Now, after earning a degree in ivory
tower postmodernism, seniors ure being forced
to repatriatc to their parents’ homes. How
about a fat check, instead?

5) Big troop/arm been 1771 Bar/mg third.
Since airports could not prevent smokers from
lighting up, they wisely herded them into a big

transparent box. The leper treatment was not
only effective, but gave ordinary people the
pleasure of laughing at, and heaping scorn
onto, those visibly inferior to them. Those
in Burling who would like to talk on a cell
phone, play audible music or engage in loud
conversation can have their own big, trans-
parent box.

7)Publication:BuildingAIIU/IalPolicy. Not
to be territorial, but could a certain aforemen—
tioned scrambling publication please clean up
after itself? We realize that we leave dummy
pages scattered everywhere and walk around
like we own the place. But we also have the
decency to balance our beer bottles precari-
ously on the ﬁre hydrant case for recycling
and hide the full bottles in the dark room
with the miliipedes. if you guys aren’t going
to be funny, you could at least be clean.
