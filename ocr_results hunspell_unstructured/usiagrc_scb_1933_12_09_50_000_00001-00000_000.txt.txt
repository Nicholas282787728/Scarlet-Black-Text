Jealous Parent
of ‘Mad’ Family

Dominates Play

‘Children of the Moon' Well
Received by Audience;

Plioduction Smooth

By STAFF WRITER

Enthusiastic applause from a large
audience voiced approval of last
night's presentation by the drama de<
partment of Martin Flavi '5 “Ch
dren of the Moon,” and served to roe
call for an encore the moon-struck
couple who had flown to their deaths
in the fog over the Atlantic.

To name the cast is to commend
all of its members highly for their
excellent handling of an emotional
struggle so subtle and tense as to
make the play a difficult one for
amateur actors to interpret,

outstanding character

Jane Scarle, as the insensate apd
selfedefeating mother, portrayed the
outstanding character with a sure-
ness and consistency remarkable in
so inexperienced an actress, showing
much ability. She succeeded in per-
suading the audience that maternal
love could be at once passionately
tender and willfully, tragically de-
structive with a fusion of the two
to a white heat that burned out her
daughter's sanity.

Ruth Pilgrim, the agonized daugh-
ter, was best in the second and last
acts; the character of the brain-
shattererl moon child having a sime
plicity and appeal of imagination,
which was by far the most impressive
feature of the third act.

others impressive

As the infirm old Judge Atherton,
victim of Luna's spell, Baxter Smith
produced the character in a manner
as convincing as his make-up was
suitable to his part. Helen Dawson,
as Madame Atherton, in a role filled
with tenderness and deep heart wi -
dom, achieved to a degree the vivac-
ity and charm of the part as played
by Henrietta Crossman in the orig-
inal production in 1923 at The Com-
edy in New York City. She was vigor-
ously dramatic, struggling tenderly
for the happiness and very reason of
her granddaughter.

Characters of the mechanic, the
doctor and the butler were portrayed
efficiently and well by Robert M.
Brown, Cuilford Collison and Robert
Polachck.

Theme of Lunacy

"Children of the Moon," besides
having something of Ibsen, contains
a quality imparted by Flavin, an
American playwright.

The theme is, quite literally, lun-
acy, Moon-madness runs in the fam-
ily cf Atherton. But it is not a case
of heredity as in Ibsen's "Ghosts,"
but the occasion for developing the
wry impulses and ingrowing affec»
tions of Laura Atherton, who had
married the Judge’s son and makes
use of this moonrmadne'es to assert
her tyranny over those she loves.

Maternal Jealousy

Her son enlisted at the start of th
war as an aviator, against her wish,
and under. the power of her inquisi-

' tional torture of suggestion of herede
itary lunacy, and the excitement of
flying in France, crashed to his death,

The play concerns the remaining
child and her engagement to an avia,
tor, occurring under circumstances
that arouse maternal jealousy,

One sees the thought of lunacy in»
stillcd like a 'drop of cold poison;
sees it spread through the girl's mind
until it blots out all sense of the real
world, making her indifferent elikc

Activity in the lntel‘class cage
tournament was renewed this after-
noon when the juniors and so‘pho-
more: met to battle it out for the
lead, and the freshmen and seniors
opposed each other to decider who
Sllould hold sole claim on Llle cellaI
position. ,

Outstanding favorites to take their
third consecutive class title, the jun-
iors were cxpccted to overcome the
sophs without a great deal of diffi-
culty. The second game, however,
appeared to be a toss»up, with nei-
Lher class holding a perceptable ad»
vantage.

While the frosb were decisively
beaten by the class of ’35 in their
first tilt, the game was by no means
a walk away. In this game the preps
did not discover their most effective
combination until the start. of the
second half, when they werc hope-
lessly behind.

Monday afternoon the juniors will
clash with the seniors, and the props
will battle the sophomores in the
last round of the meet. The juniors
and sophomores are both favored to
win their final CCHEESLS, so the re-

_ Use Five Guards

Five guards were employed in the
Duhawk .tilt by A. D. Dickinson,
Panther coach. Il'vine, experienced de.
fense star from last year‘s outfit, was
sent from the game early in the sec-
ond half, having acquired his quota
of four personal fouls. Manship, the
other regular guard, had to be with
drawn from the game because of the
recurrence of an old football injury.
While he will be started against the
Crinnell five, the Tutor coach ex-
pressed doubt that he would be able
to play the entire game.

The other Panther guard who saw
service, Kimberlin, high scorer for
the Tutors last year, and Smalling,
reseive center, will be familiar to the
Grinnell Spectators. Both men were
members of the Teachers. grid team
this fall, and from their backfield
posts. played a big part in the visi-
tor's upset victory over the Pioneers.
Piper was the fifth guard to see
action.

Lyﬂe Ineligible

Announcement this week that Carl-
ton Lytle, former Washington Junior
college star, would be ineligible for
further collegiate competition due to
the two years of participation at that
school, diminished the already limited
Tutor reserve strength. His loss was
made somewhat less serious, how-
ever, by the addition of "Rosy"
Templeton, former Monmouthstar, to
the squad,

In the last practices held by the
Pioneer outfit this week, the pas§~
ing and teamwork of the squad
showed a great improvement over
that of preceding workouts. The
scrimmages held againstthe fresh.
men on Wednesday and Thursday
found two or three different com-
binations working with almost equal
effectiveness.

During these scrimmages, coach
Truesdalc used Mason and Frye at
forwards with Oliphant alternating
with those two. At center, both
Phelps and Bauer saw a good deal of
service, McCully also working part of
the time. Captain santi, Manns and
DuMont changed off at the guard
po. tions, The coach assertcd that all
of those men would likely be used
during the Tutor contest.
