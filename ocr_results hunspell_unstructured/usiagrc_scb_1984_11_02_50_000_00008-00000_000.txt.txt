Letters:

The Great Curve. .

To the Editor:

In the S & B article on at
students who have stayed in Grin-
city, 1 was quoted as having said
that I believed economic concern
leads many students to “hoarding
knowledge rather than sharing
it," This is sufficiently inaccurate
and out of context to warrant a
correction.

We were discussing the educa
tional system in general, not just
in Grinnell, and comparing the
principle to the practice.

One wall-ls by Carnegie glossed
over with the names oi great
thinkers from ages past.

(the steps into a library tilled
with hundreds upon hundreds of
years worth oi thought at one’s
lingertips.

one picks up a Grinnell College
Portfolio which speaks of the
"Grinnell Experience" — a com-
munity working together in the in»

terest of intellectual growth 7 a
haven where students can, guided
by iaculty wisdom. strive to abs
sorb the endless thought our
species has developed, discuss
that thought, question it. and try
to develop answers around the
questions that thought creates.
This is a place for both absorbing
what has been thought and ior
participating in intellectual in
teraction so essential to the
development oi new thought e
new thought that our world will so
desperately need ii this genera-
tion ever comes to power, yet
when you walk into a room here
and share a piece oi your
knowledge, you make yourseli
less.

This is a product oi the curve, a
system that promotes larger
classes, more standardized
homework. and defies interactive

education. Curve grading is quite
Similar to baseball standings. In
baseball standings your team’s
position does not depend as much
on your team’s wins as on the
other teams' losses. On the curve,
what you know is not nearly as im»
portant as what everyone else
doen't know.

Anytime everyone kilows
something it becomes average
knowledge. li everyone in the
class knows something oi value
which noone else in the class
knows, and if one person shares
his/her tid-bid with the rest of the
class, then when the test rolls
around that person's tidrbit is
common knowledge. Everyone
gets his/her question correct but
the others kept their tidrbits from
her/him and his/her grade goes
down, The curve promoted hoarr
ding knowledge rather than share
ing it because 5 g is

detrimental to one's standing. it
promotes more standardized in-
put because the more easily
evaluated tidbits one has on line's
graph the better a curve one gets.
Economic concerns can magniiy
this eiiect, however, I don't
believe its necessarily at the heart
oi the matter, it you don't think
that people worry about these
aspects oi the curve, talk to a pre
med,

The iniluence oi the curve is not
as great here at Grinnell as in
many other places. but irom what
people tell me and irom what I
see. l believe its iniluence has
grown tremendously over the past
iew years. Whether or not the
symptoms have grown with the
cause is a question tor the in-
dividual observer.

Abortion: 3. pro-life perspective

A good friend of mine who has
worked in the pro-life movement
, ior many years summed up the
basis of the pro-life View as
follows: “The prurlile position is
based on the recognition of the
biological fact that each life
begins at fertilization and that
nothing else is added to that single
cell that each of us used to be ex-
cept nutrition, oxygen, and time;
and that therefore this is a matter
of civil and human rights."

It is worth examining her state-
ment more closely, especially the
last part: abortion is a matter or
civil and human rights. The Wrong
of abortion is that it allows for the
discrimination against a class of
people on the basis oi age; ior part
oi lite. a person is iully protected
under the law while at another
part this same person loses that
protection. The irony is that laws
protecting the right oi every
human life already exist; no long
arguments are needed in iavor oi
them. The right to liie is already
protected ior all people regardless
oi race, color, sex. creed or “a,
tional origin - but not age. The
true pro-liie position does not seek
to undermine the rights of women,
discriminate against the poor. or
engender threats oi imposing a
morality on other people; the true
pro-liie position calls for posxtive~
ly affirming the basic rights of all
people, women, men, children, old
and young at all stages of their
lives, But somewhere this affir-
mation of life in the prerlife posi-
tion has been twisted in the discus-
sion oi abortion almost beyond
recognition. This article hopes to
right the mis perception by outline
ing the basis fora prorlife affirma-
lion,

There are two fundamental
bases to the pro-lite position: a
biological base and a legal base.
From the biological base comes
an understanding at human
deielopment and irom the legal
base an understanding or human
rights and their protection.

It is the biological understan»
ding oi human growth and
development. the knowledge of
both its physiological and
psychological aspects, that gives
the legal base its grounds; Without
th(~ biological knowledge. the Idea
oi legal protection becomes
nothing more than speculation or
opinion ‘ ,

Looking at the biological base.
we begin with the acknowledges

merit that human liie begins at
fertilization; the sperm and the
ovum that combine at fertilization
to form a single cell are distinctly
human. Left to develop, they will
not turn into a rabbit. or a fish, or
a carrot. The twenty-three
chromosomes oi the sperm and
the twenty-three chromosomes oi
the ovum combine in the zygote as
fortyrsix chromosomes particular
alone to human beings.

The zygote begins to divide. and
the development proceeds accorr
ding to the genetic code contained
within the chromosomes. Later,
other cells within the growing
body will contain copies of these
chromosomes, but because of the
genetic codes, they will be assign»
ed specific functions and will not
develop like the zygote; a liver
cell will not become a human be»
ing, even though it contains a lull
genetic code. Nothing is added to
this human life except nutrition
and oxygen, and the time to let it
grow. Chemicals secreted to pro-
tect the iertilized egg irom other
sperm iorm a barrier around it
that later becomes the amniotic
sac, developing its own placenta,
umbilical cord and amniotic fluid.

Within eighteen days, a heart
has begun to develop. By twenty-
one days cells have iormed. and
may be of a diiierent bloodrtype
from the mother. Oxygen is car
ried to the developing child via the
mother’s bloodstream and it is ex
changed to the child‘s
bloodstream at the placenta, but
at no time does the mother’s blood
enter the child. By six weeks. the
same EEG scan mat registers the
brainwaves of a grown adult will
Show the brainwaves of the
developing child. Eight weeks,
and all organs have iormed and
are working: liver, kidneys.
brain, heart. even the lungs,
which suck in amniotic fluid in
stead oi air. The hands not only
have lingers but also iingerprints,
the same that the child will carry
ior life. By eleven to twelve
weeks. barely three months the
child can see. hear, swallow,
taste, and even hiccup. The child
already urinates, has tiny bowel
movements, sleeps and wakes,
and sucks his/her thumb.
Needless to say, it is known that
the child also feels pain. None of
the above is conjecturegvit has all
been documented by micro
.photography‘.‘.'and ,.experi-
ments conducted to test each se-

nse and function to discover how
and when the child develops. It is
firmly in the realm of scientific
fact.

We turn now to the legal aspect.
As noted above, it is readily ad-
mitted — by both the medical and
legal communities a that die life
we are dealing with is human. ltis
also acknowledged that the Cons
stitution provides tor the protec~
tion of the lives of all persons and
that this is perhaps the most fun»
damental and inalienable right of
all. what is not agreed upon is
whether the Dre-born should be
considered persons and thereiore
protected under the law.

The courts themselves have not
been able to develop an adequate
definition 0 “person". and the
gravity of dais can be seen in the
two cases beiore the supreme
Court that led to the legalizing of
abortion in the United States. On
January 22, 1973. the Supreme
Court held as unconstitutional the
prohibition oi abortion in Roe v.
Wade and Doe v. Bolton.

In handing down its decision, it
noted that certain restrictions on
facilities and personel could be
imposed by the various states on
abortions periormed during the
second and third trimesters, but it
nevertheless declared it legal to
perform abortions until day of
birth. while no person in their
right mind would perform such an
abortion in the last days of
pregnancy, it is still legal in the
third trimester to abort a child for
life and health of the mother I
cluding iactors such as change in
emotional health or economic
position. Important as these fac-
tors may be, they cannot
reasonably outweigh the life of the
child. This point is raised not to
engage in pro-choice terrorism,
but to note that the current basis
for legalized abortion in the
United States is based on an arc
bitrary ruling that a human liie is
not a person until birth.
Something is clearly wrong here.

Many oi nurse who consider
themselves prorchoice were 7
and are — truly concerned about
the welfare of the mother. her pros
blems in coping with a diiiicult
pregnancy, her emotional well-
being, and also for other children
in the world, mal nourished and in
difficult economic circumstances.
However, the effort to help both
women and children by legalizing
abortion has led to a

misunderstanding oi the place
and worth of human life of
catastrophic proportions, and yet
we are blind to the effects of what
is taking place because they are
so carefully hidden behind the
doors of our hospitals and the
reasonable intentions of our
friends. This pattern of en
croaching blindness to the “old
ethic" of the sanctity of life was
noted already by 1970 in California
Medicine (September, 1970). the
journal of the California Medical
Association. where an editorial
stated:

“Since the old ethic has not yet
been iully displaced, it has been
necessary to separate the idea oi
abortion from the idea of killing.
which continues to be socially
abhorrent. The result has been a
curious avoidance of the scientific
iact, which everyone really
knows, that human life begins at
conception and continues whether
intra- or extra-uterine, until
death. The very considerable
semantic gymnastics which are
required to rationalize abortion as
anything but taking a human liie
would be ludicrous if they were
not put forth under socially impeCr
cable auspices.”

Those in the pro-life movement
who are pressing tor a Human
Life Amendment to the Constitu-
tion are doing so not because there
is no protection oi liie guaranteed
by the Constitution but because
the Supreme Court has nullified
this guarantee by declaring that
human life cannot be protected
until after birth. Those who would
put full trust in the wisdom of the
Court need only be reminded oi
the 1357 Supreme Court decision
in the Dred Scott case. Scott v.
Sanford, in which the prohibition
oi slavery was held as unconstitu-
tional. declaring blacks as proper
ty riot persons. As property.
blacks were subject to whatever
an owner might choose to do. It
took the Fourteenth Amendment
to reverse this decision and res
establish the basic guarantee of
life and liberty for all citizens. A
Human Life Amendment no more
imposes a morality of others on
women than the Fourteenth
Amendment imposed on slaves
owners, it is necessary only to re-
affirm what is already‘a
guaranteed right. This is why
abortion is not just a moral issue.
but a matter of civil and human
rights.

Once in a lifetime...

Dear Editor:

I am just now responding to the
Sept. 28 issue of “Grounds for
thought." That article really hit
home and what it said is exactly
the reason I had to wait so long to
respond: I never find the time to
Just sit down and read something
for pleasure (S Sc B) because of all
the academic pressure hovering
over me like a perpetual cloud. it
is very seldom that I allow myself
the lrivolity ol a concert, movie,
lecture, symposium, et.. oi which
Grinnell so fervently encourages.
i find it so ironic — there are so
many diverse activities being oi-
fered here, yet how can the facul-
ty and administrators expect us to
take advantage oi them when our
work loads are so demanding? To
the profs I say, “Lighten up, and
allow us poor students the upper
tunity to partake in more oi the
beneficial, recreational. and

educational activities with which
Grinnell abounds.”

Susan Simon (’87)

it should be plainly acknowledg
ed that there are a multitude of
social problems that we iact to
day. Those who are pro~choice
rightly worry about how to pro»
vide for a child whose mother is
very young or poor or unable to
care ior the child. They rightly
worry about the suffering of
children who may be handicapped
or ill-loved: But- these'arecpror '
blems external to the child: pro»
blems oi money or time or lack oi
care, The problem is not the child
— and yet it is the child who
becomes die victim. We iorget
that these problems can be solved.
one by one. case by case. taking
more money and time and care
than we ever believed we could
manage. But they call be solved.
Perhaps we should remember the
words of Emma Lazarus on the
Statue of Liberty. They did not say
“Give me your rich, your well-
educated, your scientists and
engineers, . ."; they said:

"Give me your tired, your poor.
Your huddled masses yearning to
breathe, the wretched refuse
of your teeming shore. Send these.
the homeless. tempestrtossed. to
me: i hit my lamp beside the
golden door."

We do not only welcome those
children into the world who are
bright, handsome, economically
secure. We welcome those who
are less bright as well; the sick,
the ugly, the poor, the mistreated,
the iorgotten. We give them the
money we have, the time we have
a and the care they need. it is not
the children who are the burden;
the burden is our reluctance to
give them what we already have
and be willing to seek for them a
better way.

— Benjamin Gessler

A postscript: The elections are
this Tuesday, There is much to
worry about: the threat of nuclear
war, the problems in Central
America. the lack of help to the
poor. 1 would add, however. that
while many look upon abortion as
something ior a hot debate, its
consequences are very real. At
this time, some 1,5 million
children are killed by abortion
each year in the United States
alone. and in some major
metropolitan areas, the abortion
rate exceeds the birth rate. Please
weigh your conscience when you
vote. There are many lives at
stake,
