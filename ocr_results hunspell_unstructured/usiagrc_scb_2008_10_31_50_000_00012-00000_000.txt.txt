Another plug for voting and dining without trays

Last chance to go vote

We’re sui e you‘ve heard it numerous times through
out the last few months, but we at the SEiB want to
remind people once more about a little national event
occurring next Tuesday: Election Day. While we on
the editorial stafrhave our own opinions about who
we hope wins the election, we don’t want to tell you
how to vote, only to make stile that no one sits on the
sidelines for what will be a historical election.

We recognize that most students have already cast
their ballot at the ca. ly voting on campus or by send-
ing in absentee ballots, but for those who have not yet
taken part in the electoral process, thetes still time
Students intending to vote in their home states need
to remember to send back their absentee ballots be—
fore deadlines so that the votes can be counted.

But if you weren’t able to get your absentee bal-
lot in on time, don’t let that stop you from voting.
Students can still register and vote in the town of
Grinnell. While the registration process will be a lit-

dc more dillicult than during the early voting period,
you can still register on Election Day as long as you
provide proof ofresidency and identification.

As college students. we arc all part of rho ‘youth
vote,’ and historically our demographic hasn't showed
to vote in significant numbers. But with higher voter
enthusiasm across the board for this election, many
pundits think this is likely to change. Make sure you
are a part ofthis change and cast your ballot on Tues
day ifvou haven’t already voted,

LoSe the dining hall tray

Trayless dining is a change we need. (See Traylcss
pg 3) Studies and test cuscs at other- colleges nation-
wide show that trayless dining can lead to reduced
food waste by as much as 33 percent Additionally,
fewer dishes and trays will save water and clcctriciry
used in the cleaning process. '

Environmental pluses aside, traylcss dining will
lower costs associated with the dining hall and could
even have an impact on meal plan prices.

We understand that some students highly favor
the tray, Trays allow people to maximize food intake
per trip through the dining hall. Some may fear that
in the some way tiny cups infuriatcd (hind diners of
old, the solo plate could lead to frustration. However,
unlike the tiny cups, a single plane could hold more
than you could consume in out sitting.

Another obst. 1e to trayless dining is the current
design oftheJRC dishwashiug sysrrmThc convcyor
belt is designed to accommodate trays and not plates.
But with some ingenuity a solution to the problem
could be found. In lieu ofa simple solution. it may be
worth investing in a new conveyor belt or other device
now to save more in the long run,

To enact this change, students must lobby the
Dining Committee. While Dick VViIliatns has inie
tiated talks at the committee level, without students
pushing for change, it will not comc to fruition..Many
students already forgo the tray, and as more students
begin the transition the Dining Committee will have
to respond

A guide to STIFund, the fund balance and Joint Board

in the past, rapid change hasnt been a problem for
SGA and Gtinnell College. I-lowcvei,l have some
good news, and sonic bad news. The had news is
that the fund balance is gone. The good news is that
STlFund has a permanent home! so no rnorc big
projects, like bringing Cake to campus, but by giving
those up we’ve secured our ability to pay for swing-
scts and cooking utensils into the future.

First, a lirrlc bit of history. in rhc past, SGA scr

fill gaps in the budgct. lfSPC ovci-spcnr, .r was okay,
because most of the STlFund money was there to
keep SGA from going overrbudgct,

The idea behind the resolution was to shift the
money from STIFund to the fund balance. Previous
ly, the fund balance was around as a rainy day fund of
sorts. it was only ever directly tapped to bring Cake
to campus, and as a result it was met with much critir
cisrn. Once students learned that SGA was sitting on

 

aside $25,000 a year to go toward
student initiatives. Therefore,

gone it now exists as a buffer of $20,000 to help
with possiblc ovcrspendiug and pay for snrdent initia—
tives. Ifan initiative passes in the spring that calls for
a dragonrrhcmtd bouncy castle to be installed, there
clearly isn't going to bc a college department to pay
for it. So, STIFund reaches into the $20,000 pot to
pay for our .rllrwearber, dragonsthemed bouncy castle.
It costs 32,000. Next fall, the treasurer will allocate
52,000 back into the fund balance to cover the cost of
paying for passed student initiatives.

Ready for the kicker? More likely than not, this
difference won’t be realized in day—to-day applying
for funds. Groups will get fundcd, as will student ini-
tiatives. The great news is that control over this previ-
ously inaccessible pile ofrnoncy has been handcd over
to the student body. Yourvotes {or Strident Initiatives
directly decide how this money will get spent. We all
win. And that is, I'm sure, all you want to hear about
institutional budaets for 3 him , lon time.
