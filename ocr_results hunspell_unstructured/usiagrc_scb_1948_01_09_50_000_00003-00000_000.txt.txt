Dearborn Cites

Man ’3 Dual Job
In Chapel Talk ,4

“We are each charged with a
dual responsibility," said Dean of
Personnel} Administration Karl B.
Dearborn in his chapel address
yesterday morning, “that of lead»
ing a good life and of making a
contribution to society."

Dean Dearborn took "time out
for 15 minutes" to sec how ourj
American civilization has arrived
at its present status.

Mary Engen, James junior, and
Robert Clabby, Clark sophomore.
assisted in the service.

Dean Dearbor-n emphasized the“

individual’s importance in the
processes of social progress and
enumerated five variations of
theory on this subject.
1. Better mankind makes for
better times.
2. Man progresses steadily, al—
though not through his own at»
forts.
a. Society moves in cycles, eb-
bing and flowing.

4. There is no progress.
5. The “golden age" has now
passed.

Three principles of our life
were traced by Dean Dearhorn,
the inheritance of spiritual

strength and tenacity of purpose
from the pilgrim's; the idea of
self-government from the colonial
statesmen of the 1730’s; and the
principle of educating the “en:
lightened citizen” by the found-‘
ing of Harvard in 1636.
