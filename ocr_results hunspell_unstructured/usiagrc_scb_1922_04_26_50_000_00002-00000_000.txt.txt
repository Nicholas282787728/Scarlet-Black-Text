During the recent cold weather stu—

is there. Last year root ball season
brought things to light that are hard
to explain by any other means.

The democracy for which Grinncll
was famous is being torn down little
by little. The “Greeks” regard them-
selves as being above the common
horde—built of different clay. The
“common horde" in return, regards
the Greeks as a bunch of stuck up
Drigs.

The fraternity object is said to be
"to better every activity of Grinnell
College.” The members are challeng~
ed to appear in this column and show
where in they have done this.
