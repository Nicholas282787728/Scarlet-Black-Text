Watt to Try
Line Changes
in Jay Game

Klepfer, :Horton Will Start
at End Positions
Saturday

BY FRANK BEATLE

There will be a shake.up in the
Pioneer line Saturday when Crinnell
meets Creighton at Omaha, Neb, in
the sixth football game of the current
season for the wearers of the scarlet
and black.

‘Eugene chpfer, junior, and Floyd
Horton, senior, who have done sterl»
ing work in practice this week may
get the call at the end positions. The
former showed dexterity in catching
a long pass last week in the Haskell
game, and Horton has been looking
particularly good on defense.

Morgan, Sutton to Start

At tackles, it is possible that Bob
Morgan and Bob Sutton, regular
guard, will start, Bernie Trumbull
will start at his usual guard position,
paired with Earl Safris, veteran, or
Berger Graves, sophomore tackle, and
Bill Fowler will hold down the center
position.

in the backfield there is a possibil—
ity that Wes Clark, who, bothered
with a charlie—horse. had not yet re.
ported for this week’s practice Tues—
day, may not be able to start the
game. At his halfback post, Coach
L. L. (Fuzz) Watt may start Bob
(Scotty) McLeod, sophomore, who has
shown up well as a ball carrier.

Bradley, McLeod Printers

if Clark is unable to start the game,
it is probable that Jim Bradley, full-
back, and McLeod will he called upon
to do the punting, while Julius Bauer,
halfback, and Don Kingery‘ quarter.
back, will be the passers.

Vic Fini, fullback, who suffered a
dislocated collar bone in the Michi.
gan State game a month ago, report—
ed for practice Monday for the first
time since his injury, but will not ht
in shape to play until next week, Fini,
a plunging ball carrier and a good
passer, should bolster the team con—
siderably.

Jays Pull Upset

Creighwn‘s Blucjays, without a vjc.
tory this season until last Friday, sur.
prised the Oklahoma Aggies by down-
ing them 13 to 7 last week, although
the Cowboys scampered over the field
for four times the yardage made by
the visitors.

The Jay tackles, Otto Bernachi and
“Biff” Quinn, and the all—conference
Creighton center, Pat Holland, werc
the stars for the winners, knifing
through the Aggie forward wall time
and again to smear prospective ball
carriers.

Score on Passes

Both of Creighton's touchdowns
were the results of long’passes and
Coach Watt has been attempting this
week to improve his pass defense. The
Bluejays made good six out of 14 passes
attempted for a total of 84 yards.

Again Grinnell will be rated the
underdog in the Creighton contest
still having its first victory to taste
in 15 games, and playing against tht
Creighton jinx which has Nuntecl Lht
Jays victors in all but two of the
contests played with the Pioneers.

Cain Through Preps

Tuesday, the Wattmen took the de.
fense against Creighton plays as ex-
ecuted by the freshmen, and Monday
the varsity drove on offense against
the year-lings. making several nice
gains with McLeod and Hemingser
carrying the ball. Blocking by tht
varsity, however, co tinucd to be rags
ged. . v

it is probable that . Coach Eddie
Hickey will start his last week's line
up against or-innell, with Brick ani
Shepard cnds, Eemacchi and Quinn
tackles; Marchetti and Katecka:
guards; Holland, center; Anderson
quarterback; Zucrchcr and Mclver
halfbacks, and Navoichick, fullback.

of Victory Saturday ’ 5

OMAHA, Neb, Oct. 31. (Special)?
A decided victory margin in the pasi

gain in freshmen for the current sem.
ester, than any othar institution in the
state. Grinnell reported an increase
over 1933 of 60 per cent, while the
average increase in freshmen students
over the state was 24 per cent.

The state average increase was 10.

The most frequently cited cause

the increase in student cmploymcnt
