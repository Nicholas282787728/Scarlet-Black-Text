1n the wake ot‘Govcrnor Eliot Spitacr’s {all from grace. ans
other snazzily-dtcsscd New Yorker is also racing humiliating ale
lcgations. Ira stranbcr, Political science, is denying accusations
that his suits are from discount clothing stores, rather than the
expensive customemade labels he has always claimed.

The 51913 recently uncovered suspicious receipts from Men’s
Wearliousc and 1.0. Penny. The receipts. both charged to “I.
Straubcr," list different items The one from Men's Warehouse
includes seveml jackets and pants, as well as three charges for
suspenders and nvo tor cummerbunds.The J. c. Penny receipt
has 4 charges for ties on clearance and three suits, all ofwhich
are under 3100.

Despite this evidence, Strauber ﬂatly refuses to listen to ale
legations, let alone answer questions. "Your question is mindless
nonsense, beneath my contempt, not worthy of my ears," said
Strauber in response to reporters.

But these receipts ﬂy in the face of Strauber‘s claims, “He
often tells his classes that his ties cost as much as 400 dollars and
that his suits are customeiiiade," said one student, speaking on
the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from Straubcr's
famous sarcastic scorn.

Strauher has long talked about his background and why he
values expensive dress. “The reason Im a Republican is I got
beaten up as a kid, he has said when asked why he shops at
Brooks Brothers, “and I'm going to get even.“ Some of his so.—
dents, who are not normally known for appreciation of clotlr

ing, have even startcd going to the storc in the hopes ofextras
credit.

Bur apparently his morals could not keep up with ins hank
account.TIie suits on the receipts, which were a bargain $100,
confirm rumors that simuher’s Grinnell salary could not keep
pace with his expensive (note* a fate which Strauber himself
has sometimes hinted at.

"Dressing like rhis,l could he eating cat food when I retire,”
he once told his Constitutional Law class.

Responses to the receipts are varied. Stiauber acolytes are un-
derstandably shocked by these recent revelations, but many are
remaining loyalWlfl could be someone intellectually, I would be

lwouldnt want to he li'im' in terms of dress"

Others feel betrayed I just. r.hought more of him," said
another student Whats next‘ He starts wearing RKOs short-
shorts?"

college administrators have not yet addressed the scandal,
but many on campus are calling for strauber to step down.“He
has to go,”said an anonymous Political science SEPC memhcr.
“Because ifl've learned any thing from lra snauocr, its the line
portance ofshopping full price.”

Stmuber may not get as much support from the commu-
nity due to his wcllrknown hatred of social capital. “l VWIHI to
use social capital for something."he reportedly told one class. “I
want to use it to bake a pie!" Such unwillingness to foster social
relationships in small town Iowa may hurt his ahiliry to remain

But Strauber does not seem concerned by such demands to
leave. He has set his own retirement date, and intends to hold
to : ”The day no one in my class knows who Waldo is,” he told
the scars, “I‘ll stop tcaclung."

Mice clean up Cleveland lounge, reputation

BYABBYRAPOPORT8LMARGIESCRIBNL‘R

only months ago, Iowa Health and Hu-

man SerVices (lllHS) threatened to con»

dcmn Cleveland lounge as a

health hazard, due to rotting

food, excesswc smoke and

rumors of human excrement.

Now help has come from an

unlikely source.

According to residents, the
mice of Cleveland—ewhosc
presence was first reported in
the 5837M: cleaning the
dorms lounge and even some
of its residents.

Van Kenyon ’10 acknowledged Facilities
Management's efforts to maintain the space,
but said the lounge would require the entire
staff to fully clean it. “FM docs a greatjob,
but we're Cleveland," he said. “Our mess is

Mice are often criticized as messy but
this is actually a myth, copes
cially compared to the clown

residents. While one principal
complaint about mice is that
they lcave droppings around
the dorm, the Cleveland mice

rooms than Cleveland's hu-

bccn too much tor the mice, dri ng them
to rake up tools and restore the dorm to a
livable state. Human residents have reported
seeing the mice working together to use a
vacuum and opening the windows to get the
smoke out, One student even got a haircut
while he was slccping. ”They saved me a
whole ﬁve dollars," said Evan Farrier '09.
The mice’s work has been so impressive
that they’ve opened minds. “Initially I hated
the miee,"said1ai Garg '11. “But since they
repaired the burn holes in the couches. l
have seen that l was prejudiced. I need to
reevaluate the valties I learned as a child."
In light of these efforts, some are tak-

the mice with food and other enticcments.

fort does so, he said, because “it's the leastl
can do—after all, they empty the ash trays
and even trimmed my heard."

Others agree. “We’re all behind the lit’

movies like Tb: Omit Minn: Danni-u: and
Ari Ailzdrizliii Tail that we feel shed :i more
positive light on mice and mice living. Our
reputation’s notgreat. Neither is theirs, and I
think thats why we get along so well."

The smell of cigarette smoke, a mainstay
in Cleveland Lounge since it was built in
1914, is no longer the only thing that per—
meates the walls of the space, said many of
the dorin's most loyal residents who have
only one complaint about their new dorm
routes:

The place sinells a lot more like piss
than it used to, said Garg But it doesn't
really bother me
