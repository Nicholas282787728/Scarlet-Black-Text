GHS graduates recruited to begin
raising Dollars for Scholars funds

Graduates of Griniiell High School
are being sought to launch an ambi—
tious, nationwide drive to raise funds
for the new Dollars for Scholars pro-
gram here.

Russ Crawford, owner of KGRN
Radio. said his station was scheduled
to begin airing requests that “two or
three people from every graduating
class" volunteer to begin contacting
their classmates and urging that they
contribute toward the scholarship ef—
fort. '

The number to call is 235—6l06.

“We'll write down their names and
numbers, and once we get two orthree

from each class, we‘ll get them to~
gcthcr Nov. 4 at the middle school,"
Crawford said, “Once we get them
together, hopefully they've had their
reunions and already will have a list of
where classmates might be."

Crawford acknowledged that there
are several local fund drives undcrway
— for organizations like the United
Way, Gnnncll Regional Medical Cen-
ter and the Iowa Peace Institute—and
that itmiglitbedifﬁcultto raisemoney
for yet another cause.

That's why the Dollars for Scholars
effort will actually begin at the na-
tional level rather than the local level,

St. Mary’s to auction
antique potato masher

Seventy years ago, large kettles of
potatoes were mashed to serve at
chicken dinners at St. Mary's Catholic
Church pansh.

This weekend, on Sunday, Oct. ll,
one of those potato mashers, measur—
ing 25 inches in length, will be in.
cluded in the live auction at St. Mary's
Fall Festival. Florence Hotchkin and
Frances Thompson, both longtime
parishioners, recall seeing the potato
masher in use when they were small
girls. .

The festival again will include both
silent and live auctions of over 200
items. “Among items offered for auc-
tionarc a 5x7' area rug, antique Homer
Laughlin dishes and a pick-up load of
firewood,” says Debi Olson, auction
eo~chairman. “And four tickets to the
Iowa-Ohio State football game lead
the auction list for entertairunent.”

A perennial auction favorite is dine

nerforsix atthe“White House"served
by Jim and Marcia White, Jim and
Betty Ludden and Suzi and Bill Hansen,
according to Christy Pifer, herco-chair-
person. “Health items include a six-
month membership in Grinnell Re-
gionalMedicalCcnter's WellnessCenr
ter and a $75 gift certiﬁcate for eye-
glass frames," says Pifer.

Children will be interested in such
toys as a Real Talking Bubba, a Coke
Barbie Doll and a John Deere model
toy tractor. The auction has something
for everyone from patio doors to a
newspaper issued the day of the ﬁrst
landing on the moon," Olson adds.

The festival also includes a dimer, 2
raﬂle, a country store and children’s
games, haunted house and hayrack
rides between 3 and a pm. at St.
Mary’s Church and Religious Educa-
tion Center.

A family had a kitten which the
mother really didn‘t want, so while the
children were at school, Mom gave the
kitten away.

When the children came home from
school wondering where the kitten was,

tried all day to find it but couldn‘t.
Although saddened, the children went
outdoors to play. Soon, the four-year

Sugar Creek Nature Sanctuary Public Open House

A public open house at the new
Sugar Creek Nature Sanctuary ﬁve
miles west of Grinnell, sponsored by
Tallgrass Prairie AudubonSociety, will
take place Saturday, Oct. 10,
between 9 am. and 3 pm Nature
walks will begin at9 and 11 am. and l
and 3 pm. Refreshmentswill be sewed.

The 49-acre Camp Fire woodland
was purchased by the local chapter of
the National Audubon Society a little
morethanayearagoandcstablishedas
a nature preserve. The property had
been owned since 1932 by the Grinnell
Girls‘ Camp Association and used by
Camp Fire girls.

In the year since acquiring it, the
Audubon chapter has been working to
make the sanctuary Into a community
resource fornatureenjoyment and edu-
cation, Access to the property has been
improved and a parking area estab-
lished. Two walking trails through the
best part of the woodland have been
cleared and marked. Restoration has
begun on two small prairie remnants.

In the former camp compound, un-
needed structures have been removed,
the electric line buried and landscap—
ing is underway. The former demu-
tory is being reﬁtted as an interpretive
and education facility. A bird-feeding
area just outside the building can be
viewed comfortably through a large
picture window.

To reach the sanctuary from the east,
go west out ofcrinnell on Highway 6
about four miles, continuing past the
junction of T-38 and up the hill as
Highway 6 angles southwest. Near the
topoftheliill,ahighwaysignindicates
a side road to the lcﬁ, N. 28th Avenue
East which is marked with a “Dead
End" Sign. Tum down this road.

To reach the road from the west, go
cast on Highway 6 past Oakland Acres
about a mile. The “Dead End" road
sign marks N. 28th Avenue East on the
right.

Coming from either direction, drive
east down N. 28th Avenue East for a
quarter mile, then at the T intersection
tumlett(iiorth)andgoabout 150 yards.
Where the road turns cast again, cone
tinuc north on the driveway that goes
into the sanctuary entrance, about 50

yards.

tained from Russell Tabbert, chapter
vice president, 236-7309.

young people are becoming turned off
to politics and voting,“ Pate said. “Too
many times, people feel they don‘t
haveanimpactongcvemment. ...They
must understand that it is not only
important to vote, but it is our respon-
sibility."

GHS will receive materials, in-
cluding classroom curriculum for
teachers and a 15rminute video which
demonstrates the power of voting and
citizen participation. The materials
weredevelopedbytheClose-Up Foun-
dation.

The Secretary of State's Ofﬁce is

tribute and promote the program and
will also send Iowa voter registration
fomis, an Iowa voter guide and a Gen~
