EXPERIMENTAL PLAYS

“Riders to the sea," "The Man With-

PLAYS FORM VARIED GROUP

Tragedy, Melodrama and Light com—
edy Included By Experimental
Theatre in Flaps.

By Blame lllcCurr-y

The Exper mental Theatre pres
seated a varied program of three
plays, “Riders to the Sea,"
Man Without a Head," and
Lost Silk Hat” in the A, It. H. aur
ditorinm last night.

The first playH‘Riders to the
Sea,“ by John ll. Synge, is a tragedy
centering about llaorys, lrish moth-

er living on the Aran Islands, who.

has lost a husband and five son’s to
a relentless sea, only to lose her
sixth, Bartley. llaurya is wrapped
in fatalism and lost in sorrow. She
is satiated with a grief which hikes
her mourn her son's death less than
she did death's premonition.
Too Difficult.
The tragedy is entirely too dif a

cult an undertaking for the EXDGIl-l’
Building lV .

mental Theatre to attempt, but the
experiment was interesting The
blame hes not upon the players but
upon the selection of the plays. The
atmosphere of gloomy fatality was
lacking because of iaultily brilliant
lighting. The whole play did not
have the depth the text demands.
Mercedes Jelsma. as Maui-ya, gave
an even interpretation of her part

and pertormed the best bit of acting‘

in the piece. Her make-up was
Slightly too youthful. Helen Des—
mond, as Nora, and Grace Somers,
as Cathleen, carried thelr parts al-
most equally well. Donald Fessler,
as Bartley, was easy on the stage
and hell the enjoyable experience of
being drowned without getting wet
or losing any of his youthful ruddlr
ness. The “keenlng” of the Old
Women added to the atmosphere of
sorrowful tragedy

in "The Man Without a Head,” by
Lloyd T, Thanhooser and Thomas 1‘.
Foster, in, two American war vet—
erans return to France and accident-
ally Visit the half-devastated Chateau
Bronillard kept by an old servant
and haunted by the ghost of
“L'Honln-le Sans Tete." in a melo-
dramatic ending, one of the visitors
dies from the shock of a. practical
joke and the other leaps tn his death
from the balcony Window When he
hears the weird walling of the Wind
crying, "Eloise, Eloise."

Unusual Interpretation,

The “experiment of horror" em-
bodied better acting, lighting, setting
and staging than either of the other
two plays It was given an unusual
interpretation in the interposition of
the comedy element, but neverthe-
less it secured the desired single
effect of horror.

Paul Keneﬁck in his portrayal of
the old servant, Jacques, did the out-
standing acting in the whole group
of plays. 0thmer chlgemuth, as
Henry Doyle, successfully carried
across the “smart alec” type, al-
though at times his desire for a.
laugh made him too “smart.” Rus-
sell Peterson, as Wally Dean, gave a
quiet interpretation of a shell—
shocked veteran. ,

To read “The Lost Sill: Hat" by
Lord Dunsapy is to declare it
doomed to be a lumbering failur .
but the manner in which ll. was gi -
all last night proved it the contrary.
It was the froth all the program and
is to be treated as such.

PERSONNEL WORK
l EXPLAINED T0 “Y”

Nelson \ln \velnhan, Personnel
Director, Discusses Dept.

“What the Department of Person-
nel Means,“ was the subject of Mr.
Nelson W. Wehrhtln's talk to Y. M.
c. A. in the Clark hall club roonl
Thursday evening, Mr. Wehrhon, who
is the director oi one of the first
‘departments of its kind to be or-
ganized in an American college,
stated that there has been cunsldcr—
‘ahle confusion about the depart-
ments aim among some people who
think vocational guidance is a form
of manual training.

“Personnel work means exactly
,what it saysizl study oi the person,
what he is, the background of his
‘life, his home, his interest, his
hopes.” At the present time Mr.
,Wehrlmn is in correspondence with
,the standard Oil company, lutel‘nd-(
tional Harvester, Marshall Field, Ford‘
lhlotol's, Fisk Tires, Goodyear Rub~
her, and various railroads and other
[companies in an attempt to get
(their attitude toward college trained
men. He has found that business
men appreclate this undertaking, and
have pledged their cooperation to
Grinncll's pioneer efforts in the per-
:sonuel field.

As an example or personnel work
Mr. Weill-hall told the story or a
chemistry professor at Oberlin col-

a particular interest in one of his
students who was experimenting” with
aluminum. Recently Oberlin re
ceived upward of $10,000,000 as its
share in the estate of that student,
lwllo made aluminum available for
general use.
“I want you ulcn to use this de—
partlncnt and help to make it oi
service to every present and future
Gl'inllell student,” he declared.
