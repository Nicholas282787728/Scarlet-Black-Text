Students start an entrepreneurs club that will go to conferences, field
trips and work on networking with other colleges

by B.J. Bloom
Staff Writer

While many Grinncll students do not know what
they would like to do once ehoy graduate, a growing
number ofsrudenes are learning about the world of
business and finance through the Grinncll
Entrepreneurs, a new student orgonrznrion this year.
The Grinneli Entrepreneurs tries to educate its
members and the rest of the Griiinell College
community about the ways in which the business
world operates through conferences, field trips, and
networking with other schools in the area.

The Grinncll Entrepreneur: stained at the end of
last semester when the current leaders of the club.
Shekhar Shah ‘01, Eric Otcio ‘01, Wznlin Llu ‘02.
and Amit Nzngalia ‘01 , decided that there needed to
be a student organimtlon for students interested in
business and entrepreneurship. As Ashi—aijefror ‘01,
one ofthe activities coordinators for the club, states,
“We role that the need and interest existed for a group
such as ehrs, and we try ro fulfill that need,"

The club, with professor Mark Montgomery as
faculty advisor, already claims nearly sixty members.
They have brought in two speakers to campus, gone
on a fieldtrip, and atttndcd two conferences iii Des
Moincs (including one yesterday) this semester, all
without the benchr are standing budget (the group
formed after the budgets had already been set for this
semester),

“Our basic purpose is to educate people about
entrepreneurship and to provide information and
opporrunities to learn about the business world first
hand by meeting entrepreneurs in the area," says
iaffer. “The primary goal is education."

“This [the club] givesanotlierdimensroii to whet

club. “It allows For 2 forum For discussion ofissucs

opportunity to explore an area of interest and learn
more about it through exchange of ideas and case
studies." ,

in rhc business community one who were not
sponsored by a giant program from the college, such
as the Roscnﬁcld or Noyce programs. and thus were
not given an opportunity to share their experiences
with other students. In addition, the members are
working with the Career Development Ofﬁce to try
to bring companies ro campus for recruiting and to
provide information eo students about careers in
business and entrepreneurship.

The Grinnell Entrepreneurs is currently busy
planning their own conference for next semester.
According to Shah, the conference will have two parts.
First, they hope to have a few successful entrepreneurs
come to campus to “talk about their story," Shah
mentioned the founder of Brucgger’s Bagels, a
Grinnell alurn, as a possible speaker. He also said
that he was hoping to get low: GovernorTorn Vilsack
to speak as well.

The second part ofrhe conference will be more
hands-on. They plan to have a business simulation
model where participants in the conference are broken
into teams of four to five to act as the board of a
business. The participants have to make all of the
decisions rcgatding the ways in which the business is
run. Jaffer mentioned that they will have ncompiiter
model to evaluate the success oreach business team.
Shah hopes to have a large number of students,
faculty, and business people, both from Grinncll and
From other schools in the region, attend the
conteroncc.

“The club and the conference are intended to
provide a learning cxpermncc," said Shah, “We’re
also working on interacting with other collcgcs in
lawn. We'd like to do some more networking with
these schools."

Many oiihe members ortlic club are interested
in careers in ﬁnance and business, but some are iusr
interested in learning more about the way the business
world works. Both Shah and Inffcr encourage other
students interested in these issues to get involved wirh
the club, studonrs interested in yornirig can email
