Ac’rivi’ries Con’rinue

Another Nurses' Aidc class will

both civilian and military, has in-
creased the demand for nurses

students, who are interested and
can give the time, will meet
twice a week in order to com-
plete the entire course in one so-
mester. They will receive their
caps and pins at a capping cere-
mony in the spring, along with
those who began the course in
the fall. The recently enacted
drafting of nurses will make
nurses aides even more necessary
in the near future.

other war activities offered for
the second semester are cnurSES

aides, Red Cross publicity aides.

the older maps, some of which
were made by the old German
master map-makers, are now out—
dated and are collectors items.
They are rapidly being replaced,
but completion of the collection
awaits settlement of boundaries.
Under the guidance of Profes-
sors Payne, Baumann and Norton,
the students of the history de-
partment train for their places
in the post—war world. Nowhere
is this so evident as in the col-
toquium, which has been coln~
pletely reorganized over the hol»
idays to fit the program of the
school to the general situation
faced by the nation.
The department believes that

much of the current trouble is due
to the failure of thinkers and
theorists to be aware of the prob—
lems of the practical world, and
the equal deficiency in practical
men of action who too often do
not understand the theories of
government and economics upon
which they must base their ac
tions.

The senior colloquium, pre~
sented for history majors, will
attempt to relate theory to his—
torical fact and circumstance. It
will teach the student to apply
theories to contemporary institu
tions as they actually exist. The
The colloquium will also serve as
a review of the whole field of
history and government for com-
prehensives.

Dumbar‘lon Oaks
Theories Discussed
By Women Voters

Virginia Foofe and Town
Group Consider Plan
of World Organization

Speakers on a panel discussion
for the League of Women Voters
agreed Monday night that while
the Dumbarton oaks proposals,
in their present unfinished form,
were not ideal, the American peo»
ple should seize this chance for
a world organization. Mrs. Earl
D. strong, Mrs, Charles Payne,
Mrs. J. Stanley Hipp, and Miss
Frhnces Cross represented the
town league at the meeting in the
quadrangle drawing room; while
Virginia Foote, Read senior. spoke
for the college group.

Mrs. strong pointed out that
although other plans may he
more desirable, the Dumbarton
Oaks agreement is the only one
which has the authority of gave
ernments behind it. She said that
the real hope for peace is in the
General Assembly of all "peace-
lcving nations," not in the Se-
curity Council which is dominat—
ed by the Big Five.

Means of explaining the new
world organization to the people
of Grinnell were outlined by Mrs.
John Martin, whose suggestions
inclu’ded- presenting this panel
discussion before service clubs,
displaying league broadsides, and
utilizing the Grinnell Herald-neg-
ister for opinion and comment.

At the next meeting of the col-
lege league Barbara Takahashi,
president, will speak on United
states foreign policy in regard to
