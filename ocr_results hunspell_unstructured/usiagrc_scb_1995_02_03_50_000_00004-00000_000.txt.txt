lights the dual identity associated wtth
the zodiacal sign of the twins in his
workGemim' Biology, which he will
perform at 8:00 pm. tomorrow and
2:00 pm. Sunday in Robens Theatre.
The Grinnell Drumming Circle will
provide rhythm set interludes.

Gemini Biology consisLs of two
solo performance pieces,each 20 to 25
minutes long. entitledA Wliionon Sani-
eier and Darling Innocent Darling
Innocent was created in 1986. A
Whimum Sampler, his new piece, is
he ﬁrst Kotz has ever produced to
ncludetextalong with movementand
lance.

The new solo is the product of
(oil’s unique creative process,
vherebyhisideasforpiecesgothrough
igestation period. In this case it took
we to three years for him to add to and
:mbellish his work, Kotz has been
urning A Whitman Sampler from an
dea to a completed piece since the
teginning of the year with the assise
anceoffellow faculty memberSandy
vioffen and Iowa City composer Jen-
tifci' Masada.

More than simply a dance reciia],
icmini Biology combines dance. the-
ter, song and poetry into one work.

“You have to utilize whatever
ange you have to produce variety, to
rakesomethinginteresting,"Kotzbe-
eves. He describes his project as a
theatrical performance" and says it
oes “beyond the technical movement
fdmce; itincludes narrative, is musi-
al — it’s larger than Ju5| the dance
lement."

Why did Kotz choose the sign
Gemini and the idea of mutability as
themes? Kotz himself is, not so sur-
prisingly, a Gemini, and is intrigued
wtthmeconceptofbeingabletochangc
one's personality, especially as it re-
lates to performing artists.

“I’m interested in the notion of
identity,” Kotz said, “and in the per
fomier with the ability to change
who can negotiate between and
choose identities." Also of interest
to him is the anthropological imporr
lance ofduality, for example how it
is often associated thh gods and

otherpowerrulpeisonsin otlierculnires.

Kotz has never performed a
solo concert and considers the un-
dertaking to be a challenge. He’s
grateful for the encouragement of
the theater department and is glad
they are willing to support him as an
artist. Kotz believes it is important
to understand what a work means in
relation to the larger human condi»
tion,and whilehe knows ihepiece is
relevant to him, he hopes “it will
allow people to come away with a
better sense of their own identities
as well."

OYCE Wolf, the owner of
R what is arguably the most

interesting bulletin board
in the math department. is giving a
pianoconccrttomorrowzit8:00pm.
in Herrick Chapel.

Wolfwill play classical piano
music from the nineteenth and twen-
tieth centuries ranging from Bartok
Dances to Liszt and Beethoven.
This has become his almost annual
piano recital, beginning six years
ago.
Wolf didn’t begin playing pi-
ano until he was ﬁfteen. which he
found to be a little difﬁcult since
most pianists begin much earlier,
He describes his playing now as a
“big hobby." He has considered
going back to school to get a grudue
ate degree in music, although he is
a little intimidated by the competi-
tion he would encounter there.

Wolf practices almost every
day, primarily m the morning, and
is currently working on building
his repertoire.

 

Math prof plays the piano tomorrow

He has had very little experiv
ence in working with ensembles
or accompanying singers, prefer-
ring instead to focus on solo pcr-
fomiancc, plays strictly solo. He
does not play any other instrue
merits, however he does sing in
the choir. Though he once played
“loungelizard”musicatBob's. he
really doesn’t do improvisation.
he said.

In addition to his math de-
gree, he also has an undergraduate
degree in music. His thesis advir
sor in graduate school was also a
pianist. and they would on occur
sion play duets. And one of his
thesis advisor's students was one
oi the best piano students Wolf
taught, he said.

In addition, Wolf has given
private piano lessons to physics
professor Bill Case.

When asked about tlte cone
nection between music and math
Case replied, “Music is the orga—
nization and structure of sound.
and math is the study of abstract
structures."

what The Ballad of Generation X is
about, Its about when I went and saw
the Woodstock festival this last suin-
incr on TV. All these people were
saying, “Oh yes. it's just like the real
Woodstock. We'remakingacliange,"
and all they’re doing isjust slarnrdance
mg to Joe Cockcr. Which, you know,
he’s like a slow old guy. No offense to
older people, but he's not slam-dance
music or anything.

selves 77ie Hypocriler.

Jone The record also represents “Dom

have to play a lot. get good, impress
people, cut a demo and get a record

Signed. We feel like our music is some
thing fun. The kind we play isn’treally
that big on this campus but we feel that
with a record we could reach out to other
people.

Matte We're not doing this to say dial
d1eseotherbands[axen’tasgood.] That’s
notwhatthepoint is. Thepoirit is thatthe
genre ofmusic we play is basically do—it—
yourself or it doesn’t get done.

Jone Basically, we‘re not trying to make
money, we‘re just trying to get [our
music] to other people. We’re not
signing a moneyrmaking deal, either.
Xanderr We're about communication
and utiiimiion of valuable resources.

J on For example, Fearless is going to
give us flycis and we‘re going to put
uicm [in the albums]so when we play out
in other cities wc can pass it along and
other people can team about a Grinnell-
based orgniuzation that works to stop
gender-based violence.

Matte We'ic going to be sciiding [our

lictze Fearless as well.
