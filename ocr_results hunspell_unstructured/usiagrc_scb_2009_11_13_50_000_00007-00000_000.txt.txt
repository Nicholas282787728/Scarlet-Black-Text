Soccer House residents kick lots of balls

liy DARWIN MriNNiNG

1014 High St.,hetter known as Soccer House knows how to get
its game on. Each year the house gets plenty of abuse and sees its fair
share ofpanies a goal that this years resident players Ben Schemper

11,]ustin Koestcr 10, Matti Sahel 11, Alex Kohut' 10 and Andrew
Stephenson 10 are sure to score. ,

“What's truly great about 1014 is all the bro mg out thar takes
place there. Any night of the week you’ll ﬁnd anywhere between
four to eight ‘bros'hangmg at the house,” Schemper said.

Their goal as a house is summed up quite well by Stephenson.
“We see ourselves as providing a service to the student body by giv—
ing them a place to go—somewhere they can hang out for the rest of
the night, a ﬁin place for people to feel like they can go to

Indeed, this house is quite notorious for being a beacon of
warmth on cold Saturday nights after Harris parties, “The soccer
house holds many ofthe after parties for Harris and,' in short, is one
ofthc more prominent houses on High Street that allows itselfto be
trashed, ’Stephenson said.

Butbeing one of the top locations on High Street to go for some
cold beer and good company p05t~Harris isrlt the only reason Socr
cer House gets recognition. ”My ﬁrst year'Moose' [Club] ms in the
hands of Moose House," Kohut said. So when they graduated, the
soccer team took it over, not only to make sure that this wholesome
Grinnell tradition of Moose club didn’t die out, but also because
Wednesday makes for a great party night when you have weekend
soccer games."

Moose Club—a collection of students that gathers on Wednes—
day nights to play the popular Grinnell drinking game Moosrhas
grown in popularity over the ytars.This year is no dio'erent—espe-
cially since Moose has started having diﬂ’erent themes. “Ones we
have done this semester so far have been FvDaryl Moose, Ninja
Moose, Country Moose and Halloween Moose to name a few,"
Sahel said.

1014 is also known for the shenanigans that are held after the
conclusion of the soccer season. "We are most notorious for the
WEEK OF GREATEST that occurs as soon as die soccer season
ends,”Sahel said.“VVhat happens then is that the entire team comes

The most faithful wimess to this mayhem is “The Maiden”—
the house's unorthodox, wooden, attended-length beer pong table
and central ﬁlmiture piece.

Have you been in theVag?

BY AVERY ROWLISON

Rachel Whitﬁeld ’10 wants to get one thing clear~“It’s
spelled Vadge, nor Vag. Let's not be juvenile." Except we are
juvenile, and it is the Vag.

The residents of1132 Broad Str,Maggie Kamraczewski '10,
Liza Brost 10 Andrea Birget 10,Cari$tayer 10 and Whit»
field are tired of the jokes that come along with the name of
their house, which' is considered the female counterpart to the
Slumithe mens cross country house (see other article).

They’ve even tried really hard to change the name this year.
“Maggie came up with awhole list ofother names, but none of
them stuck," Whitﬁeld said. Everyone has begun to associate
the name with the house.

The five girls have a strong bond, and even though not all
of the girls are runners, there are other connections between
them."Andren, Cari and I are all psych majors,"l(amraczewski
pointed out, And they get along well, though all the girls joked
that Kamraczewski read Marie Claire for the entirety of the
interview and complained about her roommates,

Bur the girls try ro pur their complaints aside and work to
gether to keep the house spotless, as each resident has her own
speciﬁc job. “Whose turn Is it to replace the soap?"\’\/hitﬁeld
asked. “it's certainly not mine.”

On the tour, Whitfield said she had the best room because
orrhe separate study and bed rooms joined together by a short

door. “But a guy of 5'1“ or 6'2"could easily ﬁt in there,” she said.
When asked about any juicy stories, Kamraczewski said, “This
one time a 6’ 5” guys tried to get in Rachel’s room...” but then
digressed to telling a story about when Whitﬁeld fell down the
stairs in the middle of the night and Kamraczewski mistook it
for thunder, before she could elaborate on the more juvenile,
appealing story.

They showed offthe “Shenanigans" room in which all hair
and makeup is done for parties—photos ofsome fun “shenanir
gans they have pulled line the walls. “We have even included
some pillows and blankets in the room for those who decide
to sleep there," Whitﬁeld said “Or do other things in there,’
Brest added

So far the Shenanigans room has been underused since the
girls haven‘t had many parties this semester. “It's cross coun-
try season, we don’t have social lives,” Brost said, hilt reassured
that there will be more soon. Brost wants to throw a Librarians
and Barbarians party while Stayer and Birget plan on throwing
parties for GORP.

But beware oftheir particsithc girls read to wind up in
strange situations. One morning Staycr and Birgct woke up to
rind some unknown naked people passed our on their couches:
Their acceptance of situations such as this shows that the gills
at the Vag are relaked and okay with most everythingijust
don't make “that Vag joke".

The residents of 1014 are well aware ofthe neglect to which they
subject their home. "it has the potential to be a really nice house. It’s
just we’ve been neglecting it a little to much and we should probably
get on that," Stephenson said.

Yet it doesn't seem like they’ll be getting on it anytime soon—-
they'll be too busy getting their party on leaving fans cheering and
the Maiden smelling otbeer,

DAG invites all citizens to storm their castle

uv TEssA CHEEK

As I approached DAG house 1128 East St,
AKA Pine Tree I-Iouse,l thinkI expected a secret
casde situation—Pine Tree house on East Street
without, stony castle within. And in the begin—
ning it looked pretty goodithere was a broken
cinderblock with a rope looped through it on the
deckiboth adequate castle building material and
a potentially scary weapon,

Plus, ifyou know anything about casdes, then
you know that the hardest part is getting in,which
is absolutely true at DAG house, where the door»
bell has been broken for several months.

“Yeah, FM was supposed to get us a doorbell,"
said resident Erika Graham '10, who happened to
find me lingering by are locked door. She went
on to laugh at the whole doorbell thing, noting its
irony in the face ofDAG‘house's open door policy

DAG is the commonly used abbrexdation for the
campus club devoted to DAGorhirﬂ combat
driven battle gamHid accessibility is key to
DAG house's being a headquarters.

“DAG house acts as a news for a number of
groups," said resident Hugh Potter ’10. And in
deed regulars ofthe hotlusthh range from the
people who live there to members ofChainmale,
Belly Dance and various friends who come by to
cook or participate in DAG activities—seem to
have found a way around the front door. "some
people hang on the back window," resident Jake
Sapir’lo, said.

Inside, the most striking dung about DAG
house is probably the weaponry. There's a mas-
sivc armoirc devoted to it in the foyer and a pile of
diings to be ﬁxed—ranging from swords to some-
thing that looked like a club—spilling out around

and into the ﬁreplace in the living room.

"[Sroragc] is die keystone arour housing pro-
posal," Graham said “it would probably all be in
my room true didn't have a house, so mat would
be really depressing.”

Collegerowned Pine Tree House’s massive
lawn and large occupancy are also well suited to
DAG's needsmie yard is huge, which is another
reason we like this house, and we’ll sometimes
play out there," Graham said,

But not everyone who lives in DAG house is
actually in DAGThe house is as dedicated to the
culture surrounding DAG as to the sport itself7
in other words, it's for all Citizens ofthe kingdom,
notjust the warriors. “DAG, it's important to un-
derstand, is not just the ﬁghting, there’s a load of
other ﬁrings that go on,”Potter said.

In addition to its role as storehouse, lodgings

and stage for games both field and console based,
DAG house also serves as a place for students to
come together Although sometimes cheir mode
of togetherness involves separate moderns.“1t's
hilarious when you come in and everyone's on

' their laptop," Potter said. “It's like a'laptop forest.”

rest include an )Cbox, a Playstadon 3 and a

But the best forms ofcntertainmcnt in DAG
house are those that the residcno create for them-
selves. In the brief span of my visit the crowded
living room broke into debates about the role of
DAG house, the potentially sexist nature of their
quote board and who spent the most nights crashr
mg on the couch. “This is a free spirited discussion
