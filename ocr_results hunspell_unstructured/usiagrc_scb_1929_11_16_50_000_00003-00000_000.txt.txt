Gallup Lectures on
‘High School Paper’

"If you do not have a story worth
bannering. go out and make it," said
Mr. George H. Gallup, professor of
journalism at Drake university. be-
fore the press convention Friday
morning at eleven o'clock in the A.
R. H. auditorium. His subject was
“The High School Paper." Makeup,
news, and advertising were the three
points which Mr. Gallup stressed.
“But remember that there is a dif-
ference between making and faking,"
he continued. “Some papers fake
their news rather than make it.” He
spoke of the fact that more people
turn to the paper with the banner
headline than to papers without.
“The high school papers can make
more use of the banner and the stu—
dents should take advantage of this

.opportunity, it doesn't take any more

to have an attractive paper than an
unattractive one. It is important for
the paper to look newsy rather than
attractive."

Gallup stressed advertising. “It is
usually the job given the fellow who
can not write. and it isn't considered
much of a job, but it is more im—
portant than editorial writing, it is
an excellent training for opportuni-
ties greater than writing.

“Say and show something in your
ad that will make you read and then
make you want to get it. The best
way to sell advertising is to go to
your advertiser with the ad made up
and he is sure to buy it, it will save
his time. and if you are wise—take
up more space, than if he had to take
time to write it up himself," conclud~
ed Mr. Gallup.

Hanson Advocates
Publishing Annual

”Whether or not to publish a year
book should never be a question in a
school of two hundred or more stu'
dents," Mr. A. P. Hanson of the Ce~
dar Rapids Tru—Art corporation told
the press convention delegates this
morning in his talk "The High School
Yearbook.” "Every class in every
high school is entitled to a memory
book of those most happy and profit-
;able years."

“The staff," Mr. Hanson 'said.
”Should get the material to the e
graver and printer early, and avoid
work carelessly rushed through at the
last moment. The business manager
also should possess himself early of
complete information on the financial
prospects, and should pursue a con-
servative policy in making contracts

with printers and engravers."

Campus Opinion

Qllcstlon: Are you in favor of al~
lowing unlimited cuts to upperclass
students with an A or B average?
Dean Beauty—«I would remove the
penalty for exceeding the cut limit
for these upperclass students.

Miss Lowdenil’neoretlcally, I be-
lieve in the system, So far as Grin-
nell is concerned, if the system were
to work out successfully, freshmen
and sophomores would need to be
taught more serious habits of study
and to be graded more rigorously.
Such a system, successfully carried
out, would encourage that independ-
ence of the best students which an
education should want most to en—
courage,

Elizabeth Lyndeil don’t think it
would make a difference in the num-
ber of cuts. it might give an incen»
tive for better work.

Edward Tyleril think it would be
a good idea for the general run of
upperclassmen even though it might
not work in some cases.

 

Roberta Vance~Upperclass stu—

dents who have an A or B standing
will surely use common sense in
making use of such a privilege. in
in favor of it.

Helen Mar Thompsouil think
it’s a smart ideal I’m planning to
get a B average

Marjorie Stivel'iThose with a high
average are the ones who are inter-
ested in their work and they would
not abuse the privilege.

Claude RlclleyiThey shouldn’t be
favored in that way, because they
are the ones who don't go out for
athletics and outside activities and
they have more time anyhow,

When the Carleton gridders trot s
out onto the Pioneer ﬁeld at Grinnell
this Saturday. they will be under the
leadership of the last captain Carle-
ton will ever see. For with the close
ing of the 192930 athletic season, the
Minnesota college will discontinue the
practice of electing captains for the
season, and thenceforth will i-lame a
captain before each game, as other
schools over the country are doing.
