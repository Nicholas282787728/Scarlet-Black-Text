Competition Keen For
Valsity B e r t h s
This Year.

With the class series practically
.over, this year's varsity basketball out-
look begins to take deﬁnite form.
While no indication of varsity team
play nlay be obtained, as yet, the per-
sonnel of the squad and the general
mcl-its obrndividual players is shown
to a considerable extent in the prelimi
nary series.

Good Basketball.

The class of basketball evident in

the class series was better by for than

the average, which means that the ma
terial from w iclr Coach "Billy" Shei-
man will pick his varsity is excellent.
There were few really outstanding
stars in the class games, a goodly
number of athletes exhibiting Class. As
a result, it is not probable that the
coach will be so handicapped for lack
of capable substitutes as as the case
last year.

Indications thus for are that ﬁve
good forwards will contend for the two
var 'ty berths in the persons of Can-
tain Evans, Whitehill, Meredith, Her—
hrecbtsmeyer autl Gossard. Each
demonstrated that he was able to
compete in intercollegiate circles, with
the result that it is not probable that
any two men will be able to monopo-
lize regular berths.

Guards I‘lcnﬁfnl.

Winter and Wasscnaar, two veteran
varsity guards, will be forced to the
limit to gain preference over such
men as Datesman, Willis Macy and
Janssen, all of whom are possessed of
considerable experience and ability.
The last named may be tried out for
a varsity berth at center, where he
will be forced to battle with Fearing
for the regular position.

while the material at hand is good
and should develop under Sherman
into a machine of which Gl'inncll will
be proud, another factor enters into
the situation which offsets to some
extent the rosy quality of the outlook.
It is the fact that during the present
season the Pioneers will meet a
goodly number of Stroll: Conference
teams. The schedule is heavier than
ever before and may include, in addi—
tion to the games already scheduled.
come contests with strong western
teams on a crusade into the highly re-
puted east.

For this reason, the Pioneers will
need every bit of the good material
which they have at hand, and will be
forced to the limit to come out with
a creditable showing when the season
ends and the sheep are separated from
the goats.

‘Juniors Hold Frosh To
Unexpected Score 7
Both Games Fast.

Fighting every minute of the time,
the seniors "came back strong" are
for their defeat at the hands of the
Props Monday, and scored a, victory
over the Sophs last night to the count
of 11 — 9. It was a battle royal, both
teams exerting every ounce of energy
to keep in the lead .At one time
were the secondryeal' men in the lead,
this being right at the beginning of
the game when \Vlllltehlll counted from
the field for the first score of the con-
test. Wasscnaar immediately follow»
ed up with a marker for the seniors
and from there out the upper—class
men held the advantage.
Guarding plusc

The size of the score indicates close
guarding on both sides, and this was
one of the features of the some. Few
fouls were called on cithcr sidc, ev-
eryone in this as well as m the game

Juriio Frosh Battle First

In the second game of the evening,
the Juniors displayed a decidedly
stronger wullop than they had shown
in their first game by holding the
yearlings to a 16-18 score, They
started the fuss by chalking up a
ringer within the first minute or two
until within five minutes of the cud,
when the Preps came from the rear
with two counters which put them in
the lead and the final whistle found
the rally 18-16 in their favor. The
fact that each of the trrst three periods
ended with the class of ’22 leading by
a one-point margin tells how hsrd
fought the battle really was.

Juniors Gel: Tugctllur

Credit must be given the whole June
ior squad lor- the clevel, machine-like
playing. Herbrechtsmcyer led his
team in scoring with two fields goals
and two free throws. His two from
the floor followed each othei in close
succession and came at a time when
the Preps were seriously threatened
the Juulol's’ lead. I-larshbar-ger, Mile
ler, and Macy also boosted the totali
with their lllnl'kels.

henz again performed lh excellent
fashion for the first-year outfit, con-
tributrng three field goals and two,
free throws, Slinkcr coming next with l
two counters. lie came in fresh at a
critical point in the tray, and his work
in adding to the score probably pulled
the game out of the fire for the Preps.

L’Alliance Francoise
Present French Farce

"Le Cuviel'" a French farce was pre-
sented Tuesday evening in the Little
Theatre at an open meeting of L’Alll‘
unce Francoise. Mai-renne Miller as
Jacouette represented the ficticious
lmother -la\v, a type in vogue evell
in the th century when the farce
,was written. Ruth Chamberlain was
Jeannette, the wife, who coyly ruled
the household. The part of the hus»l
bond, Jacquinot was presented byl
Elinor Brown. The action of the play
was so well presented that it could

lly be interpreted by those iii the
laudlence who did not uuder-tundi
French. The unique stage ctting
planned by Ruth Chamberlain and
painted by Itobcrt Bridlong and the
costumes helped to create the atmos-
phere of the Mcdiacvar life. Prof.
John Smith and Miss Magdclaine Pel-
let of the French faculty directed tllc‘

Compromise Plan Worked Out by.
Council After Plea of
Activities Heard.

That student organizations who have
applied for permission to take charge
of regular varsity dances, and to re-
ceive profits from the dances, would
not be given such permission, was flee
cided by the student council at a
special meeting held Thursday A
compromise was reached on till point,
however, by the passing of a motion
making it possible for the student
council to apportion dance proceeds
to such organizations who need them
for work done in behalf of the college
or endowment campaign.

some agitation had been started to
make it possible for student organi-
zations to use the dances as means 01"
support, rather than to make financial
drives on the the student body as a}
whole, but the student c
cliiied to take the responsib ity of ii
criminating between the various ol‘-‘
ganizatious applying for dances. Fear
of politics interfering with the proper
awarding of dances to worthy bodies_
also made it inadvisable to give dances '
cntir-cly to the direction of ol'galli-.
zatlons.

Miss Read, Dean of Women, ap-
peared before the council to urge that‘
the requests of the studcnt organizer
trons be refused.
