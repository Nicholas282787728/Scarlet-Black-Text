New coach elaborates outlook

by Paul Schwartz’

Edward s. Dombrowski,
Grinnell’s new head football coach,
is “young. enthusiastic, and
aggressive.” says athletic director
John Pﬁtsch.

Piitsch expressed much pleasure
concerning the new addition to the
physical education staff. In
commenting on his diversity as a
coach, Plitsch said, “It‘s not in-
tended now, but there is the
possibility of him coaching
baseball, He's experienced in
the conference and we knew him
pretty well," Pfitsch said, “He‘s
familiar with our situation and can
relate to people pretty well."

SIGNED TO A two year contract
as an assistant professor of
physical education, he will also
serve as head wrestling coach and
assume an additional position,
probably as an assistant or head
coach of another sport.

Dombrowski is currently
finishing this semester as head
baseball coach at Ripon College,‘
where he was an assistant football
coach and head wrestling coach
earlier this year. In commenting
on why he decided to apply for the
opening at Grinnell, Dombrowski
said, “I was looking for a position
that offered me a challenge and I
found a pos on which I felt I was
ready for as a next step up in my
career goals. Grinnell was the type
of place i was looking for because
of the situation that presented
itself." he added. “It allowed me to
be a teacher and communicator,
and to work with young men that
are goal oriented,”

DOMBROWSKI FEELS he will
have no problems in dealing with
the general attitude at Grinnell
that academics take a higher
priority in a student's schedule
than do athletics. *‘T-he philosophy
l'm bringing with me is close to the

‘ Midwest Conference attitude,” he

said, “The philosophy in my
program is you came to Grinnell
because you wanted an education,
Sports is secondary. hutof primary
consideration while you're there
practicing, You leave athletics
behind you in the classrooms, but
you leave academics behind you
when on the sports field.

No stranger to the ”Midwest
Conference attitude." Dombrowski
is a graduate of Goa College, where
he was a member of the Kohawk
team that won the Midwest Con
ference football championship in
1974. He received All-Midwest
Conference honorable mention as a
back that year and has also been
honored in wrestling and baseball.

HOMBROWSKI ORIGINALLY
hails from New York's lower east
side but attended Perkiomen
Preparatory School in Pennsburg,
Pa., prior to coming to the mid
west. Soon after graduating from
One in 1974 with a BA. in physical
education. he returned to the east
coast. Dombrowski held positions
in both physical education and
coaching at Chopticon High School
in Morganza. Md. and at Potomac
State College in West Virginia. He
earned an M.S. degree at West
Virginia University and joined the
Ripon College staff in I977.

Dombrowski was chosen from an
initial pool oi as applicanc. He was
reviewed by a special search
committee appointed by Dean
Waldo Walker in addition to the
Executive Council, the faculty
members of the athletic depart
ment, and a committee of students
chosen from several athletic
teams.

STEVE BOLESTA. head of the
student committee which met with
Dombrowski when he visited
Grinnell in early March, said the
committee was looking for
someone who's philosophy was
consistent with that of Grinnell's.

“We though this was important.
although not ultimate," he said.
‘ “Overall, he was very well—
qualified."

Commenting on his visit to
Grinnell, Dombmwski said he was
“very surprised with the con-
servative attitude that prevailed,"
noting the Seriousness with which
most oi the athletes he met pure
sued their studies. He recalled
tales of Grinnell he had heard
during his days as a student at Coe,
and said. “I was quite surprised to
see the tremendous change-over
from a liberal attitude,"

DDMBROWSKI DID express
certain concerns about the change
in the hierarchy of Grinnell's
football program. There are
always people feeling left out or
left behind when a new Coach is
brought in. he noted “Anytime
there’s a change, there's confusion

. My transition will be people
returning and helping me get
other guys to understand it'll be a
rough road"

Dombrowski also said that he
was sure he would introduce
“many things which students are
unaccustomed to, and they‘ll
question me." but he felt confident
that he would be able to talk
matters out with his players.

He stressed his desire to befriend
the athletes. stating, “I think we'll
get along real well and enjoy a
closeknit family relationship." He
finished, saying. “I‘m really exr
cited lobe going toGrinnell . . . My
house and home will always be

 

open to athletes.”

Tho imh annual Spring Folk Dance Concert will he held today and
tomorrow at 8:00 pm. in nohcrts Theater. Dances of various national
origins will be performed in hand scwn costumes ilesigiicd by tho
troop. Pictured above is the Bulgarian cehiirjaiiliiiio hora.
