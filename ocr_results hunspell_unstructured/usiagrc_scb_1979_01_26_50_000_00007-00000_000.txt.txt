Male cagers: A different team?

by Andy Schultz

At about his time last year the
men's basketball team was trying
to pull itself together after a period
of dissension. Remember? The
situation was bad enough that
some players made serious effort

to oust Coach Arthur Peterson
from his job as head coach.

Last year's dissatisfaction
centered around an apparent lack
of communication between the
team and Peterson. Players found
practice sessions of little value and
did not see any logic to Peterson‘s
decisions about -who played and
who sat on the bench Fur-
thermore, they did not feal a good
rapport existed with the coach.

PLAYERS MET WITH Athletic
Director John Pfitsch, They
presented Pfitsch with a series of
petitions and talked to him about
getting Peterson removed from his
job. This effort faltered quickly
following player discussions with
both Pftisch and Peterson himself.

These discussions Served to air
player grievances and to satisfy
them that positive action would be
taken, Most of all, the talks helped
w relieve the hostility and tension
surrounding the turmoil.

Eventually. things were ironed
out, but where do they stand now,
one year later?

“LAST YEAR IS Still remem-
bered" says tam co—captain Matt
Miller, ”but we're trying to put it
behind us.”

Peterson himself was more
emphatic, “The last year thing is
dead," he Said. Peterson went on to
point out that this year's team is
composed of different players.
which results in a different team
character.

“HE MAKES AN honesteiiort to
communicate," Miller said. ”We
listen to what he has to say. We
may question it sometimes, but we
listen." »

Basketball players practice in Darby oyml Despite better
relations between the team and coach Arthur Peterson, the
Pioneers have posted only a 2—3 record so tar this season

_ Players uniiormly expressed die
semiment that the Situation has
indeed improved Communication
channels have opened up and team
morale is high. Players said
Peterson has become more
responsive, holding team meetings
to discuss problems and being
more accessible to individual
idiiiiculties,

“WE'RE PLAYING together as
a team," Peterson said. “The
player-to—player relationships are
better. There is less animosity and
jealousy between them."

A few submerged problems still
seem to exist on the team.

One player who wished to remain
anonymous said there were still
lthings done in practice that have
no apparent meaning. The player
also complained Peterson
criticizes too much and praises to
little. a complaint made by last
years players as well.

WHEN ASKED IF players tend
.‘to complain amongst themselvs
about Coach Peterson, the player
said: “They may gripe behind his
back, but he'll find out about it.”

Several players mentioned a
basic problem with Coach Peter»
son. They indicated that he is a
coach who would be more at home
at a school where athletics were
more important in the daily lives of
the students,

PETERSON DENIED
sentiment.

“It’s no problem for me to coach
here. .There are different
motivations for people who play
basketball here, Here they
play because they like it,"

SO FAR THIS season, the
Pioneers have posted a record of
two wins and eight losses.

”We realize we're not going to
win every time," Peterson ad
mitted, “We’d like to win more, but
we're not going to get too
depressed about losing."

In comparing this coaching style
last year with this year Peterson
and “I used the experience to
shape some of my actions. l
couldn't help but do so. But we‘re
past that now. We're much difr
lerent this year "
