Jane Goodall on Animal Experi-
menlation

Dear fellow scholar,

This is an invitation to panici-
pate in a dialogue,

I am writing to you on behalfof
the millions of animals each year
who are subjects of laboratory ex-
periments conducted at unversities in
the United States and Canada.

These experiments, some of
which cause severe and protracted
pain, are subjected to little public
scrutiny, but the way animals are
treated is a matter of public concern,

In the past. when great national
and intemational issues arose, fo-
mms on college campuses played an
imponant role in setting forth the
issues, educating the public, and don
lining the national debate.

Accompanying this letter is A
Call For Public Forum: On The Use
OfArtt'mal: In Research Arid Educa-
tion. It asks people, especially at
colleges and universities, to learn
about and discuss animal experi-
mentation and its actual practice
in your own community, and to
take part in or to set up educational
forums on the broad range of is—
sues regarding the use of animals
in research and education.

The broad aims of this initiative
have been endorsed by the American
Humane Association, the American
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (ASPCA) and the Humane
Society of the United States,

Researchers state that animal
experiments are conducted for rea-
sons such as advancing knowledge
and curing disease. But treating our
fellow creatures as we do, on the
scale we do, raises critical questions,
Failure to examine them honmly is a
failure of our own humanity.

Mahatma Gandhi wrote, ‘The
greamcss of a nation and its moral
progress can be measure by the way
its animals are treated.” By this mea-
sure, what can we say about our own
nations?

Would you play a part in helping
to organize a forum concerning ani-
mals in laboratories? Or would you
make a point, if you are not already

knowledgable about the subject, to
learn about the actual use of animals
in experiments on your own campus,
and to share what you learn with
others? Or would you at least take it
upon yourselfto learn more about the
issues raised in the Call For Public
Forums?

One immediate way you can help
is by copying and circulating this
letter and the Call forPubli‘c Forum
to others; especially to students in the
many relevant fields, such as medi-
cine, veterinary medicine, biology,
philosophy and theology; to mem
bers of environmental committees,
animal protection committees, and
student govemmeni: to concerned
members of the faculty; and to any
special friends of animals.

Another way you can help is by
phoning or visiting the editorial of-
ﬁce of your campus newspaper, and
requesting them to publish the Call.
They should be receiving the Call
and a press release. If they haven’t,
would youbekindenoughtowrite,e-
mail, orpreferably tophone the Green
World Center, and we will get the
material to them.

And please bear in mind: One of
the greatest barriers to social change
is the confrontational approach.
When entering into a dialogue with
someone holding a view opposed to
one's own, it is important -- hard as it
may be » to listen to the otherwith an
open mind. We must understand the
other‘s point of view, and we must
respect facts. Many areas of discus-
sion do not resolve neatly into black
and white. Learning from and rea-
soning with those who do not share
our views is one way we grow as
people.

Sincerely yours,

Jane Goodall

LETTER FROM

10-28-94

Campus Security, or LackThereof

So we‘re in the middle of Iowa,
an hour from a true college town and
five hours from acultural metropolis.
News takes two days to reach us;
mail takes four. Nothing really ever
happens here,socampussocurityisn‘t
a problem. In fact, Grinnell is so
sheltered, so exempt from crime of
any sort, that our safety is a major
selling point of the College to pro-
spective students.

How smug.

Sunday night, a Grinnell student
was attacked with abaseball batright
outside of Steiner, on Park Street, 50
yards from the collegeaowned house
in which Ilive. As is usually thecase
with such assaults, there was no mo-
tive, little publicity and, initially, few
policeleads. Atpresstime,thepolice
did haveaconfession from the assail-
ants.

The incident is not what catae
lyzed this editorial, but a number of
things about it do bother me. The
studentwas walking with threefriends
when he was attacked. it was 10:00
pm. -- not late at all by most stanr
dards, and one of the most active
times for Grinnell students. Park
Street is a wellrtraveled street. There
is more lighting there than in most
places in Grinnell. The student’s
friendshadtogoloahouseon 7thand
Park Street to call the police and
paramedics.

Grinnell, both town and college,
are holding onto, with an ignorant
tenacity, the belief that our commu-
nity is safe and doesn't need addi-
tional security beyond the typical
police force, No, the incidents aren't
common and generally aren’t of the
severity that we are used to seeing on
the evening news. But in a commu-
nity this small they really shouldn’t
happenatall. Yes. the College has an
escort service. But if four students -
- mostly men -- walking together
aren’tenoughtodeterassailants,how
secure are two people going to be?

THE EDITOR

Every other college campus I
have visited has public emergency
phones, better lighting and a campus
security force. Iknow that funding is
not a problem. Grinnell’s endow,
men: is one of the largest, if not the
largest. in thenation for an institution
of our size.

I am not recommending a pri-
vate security force of the Gestapo
proportions that students have pan-
icked about in the past. Obviously,
such an overreaction would do more
harm ihangood. We don‘tneeddorm
mothers, watchdogsor nightstickrtot—
ing cops. We do need help staying
safe, but our self-govcmance must
continue. its arrogant and foolish to
assume that just because we have a
lower crime rate than, say, the Uni-
veisity of Chicago or Yale, that we
will basically disregard one or two
incidents a semester. (And those are
only the ones that are reported to the
public). That type of thingshould not
happen at all, but it does. and our
system of protection is inadequate to
handle it.

As residents of this campus for
75 percent of the year, we should
demand public emergency phones
with direct lines to the police and the
nightwatchpeison,morelightingand,
under careful restrictions, maybe one
or two more night waichpersons.
lmportantly,foreveryorie’ssake,stay
far, far away from the rent-a—eops.

So what if Grinnell is safer than
almost anywhere? The additions to
our security system will be worth it
even if they are used only once.

Grinnell sells itself in pan on
safety and that small-town, middle—
America sense of security and free—
dom from fear. Thatimage is swiftly
becoming an illusion. We need to
have only a few safety features that
won’t do any harm but might do
some good. Our world has. unfortu- '
nately,becomesuch thatitisnolonger
practical to do without.
