Nineteen such combinations oi Majors
are tor-molly recognized and ireely
open to the election ot students: oth»
ers may he allowed that do not appear
incongruous. The result ol this ar-
rangement is that, ivhile the student
must include in his program all the
Subjects regarded as essential to a
rounded college course, it is also im-
possible for him to graduate without
having given at least two solid years
ot study to each at two allied suhiccts,
Adaptability.

The student naturally selects such‘
Majors as are congenial to his pecir
liar talent and as will prepare him
hest tor his lite work; and he gets
the advantage ot immediate prepara-
tion 101' his later study or occupa-
tion without the rislt or narrowing the
range or his interest and culture dui~~l

Finally, these important advantages
are not purchased at the price at unr

ot the Group System ovcr even such

A casual glance at the courses misr-
Ed in the several departmeulsi
pared with those of some other insti-
tutions, might lead to the conclusion
that there is little choice. But when
one reﬂects that the courses are intenti-
ed tor undergraduates, the matter is
seen in its true light. it student has
lour years to devote to a subject, and
doublingrup is on many accounts un-

com-

desiraoic. By the arrangement ot give
ing Minor, Major and Post-Major

courses, three years are provided. in
most cases the Post-rinior is changed
trom year to year, thus ohtering in
reality IDiil‘ or more years' work. The
most marited advantage to the student
lies in the choice character or the
worlt outlined in each course and in
the poi-tact adjustment, by which
students, who gain admission to a
class, are as nearly as possihle equally
prepared. in other words, there is as
much choice as the student, in the
time availahle, can take advantage or.
and the embarrassing need at organiz-
ing equivalent courses in order to save
the advanced classes from disintegra-
