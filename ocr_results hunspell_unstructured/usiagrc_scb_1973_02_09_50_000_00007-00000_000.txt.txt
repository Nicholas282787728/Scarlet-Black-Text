The Iconoclast

”Open Campus And The Cry Of The Wild

by Gregg Daffner ‘

The recent attempt by a self ap-
pointed elite group to leftist stUr
dents at Grinnell to prevent a Mar
rine Recruiter from holding career
conferences here is the latest ex—
ample of the pramatic, antirireedom
stance of the “new Left", and an
illustration of the hypocritical real-
ity of their intentions.

in response to this move, some
students have observedthe “repres-
sive nature" of this “determination
to censor what views may be pre-
sented on the Grinnell campus”
(David Crow, scB. Feb. 2), while
others have merely laughed at what
they interpret as the bored desper-
ation of some would-be radicals
without an issue. The issue, how-
ever, is no joke, and reflects the
growing desire of some to ferment
activism amidst a growing quietude
on the campus. Moreover it repre-
sents a movement, well established
in the 60’s to create a leftist or-
iented closed school.

strictly speaking, this issue is not
one of censorship.» ”Censorship"
pertains only to governmental ac~
tion, and no private individual or
group, (such as the Peace Collec-
tive) can silence a man especially
not a representative of government,
such as the Marine Recruiter. Only
government has this power. All his
dividual or group on campus can,
however, effectively preempt cer-
tain group’s trom appearing atorin-
bell, and hence, loosely speaking,
one could say they "censure" the
expression of ideas by these groups.
For years students worked to ac-
chieve an “open" campus, where
anyone could come and express his
ideas. Allegedly such “open" for-
ums were the goals of the student
movement since Berkeley in ‘64.
Today Grinnell is such a place.
The theory behind the “open” came
pus is that students are socially
and intellectually mature enough to
hear all viewpoints and judge inde~
pendently and rationally for theme
selves. Hence there is no need to
artificially limit the ideas available

to the student. There is, on the otr
her hand, an opposing viewpoint
which holds that the students are
generally too immature to make
their own judgements, that they can
easily be swayed to dangerous view
points and that rather than allow
the student to see the depravity of
certain views, the administration
should protect them, Hence the “clor
sed” campus

The View of the ”leIt" is that Ame
ericans are indoctrinated from birth
into believing in' and supporting an
aggressive regime and that repre-
sentatives of that regime should be
silenced whenever possible - and in
their place, students should be in-
troduced to representatives of “pe—
ace~loving socialism”, Grinnell is
only a small part of the vast “mi—
litaryrindustriai complex” but it's
all we’ve got, so let's begin the
revolution here. Which is to say
that contrary. to leftist public rhe—
toric, the "New LeIt” is not in
favor of an “open" campus — rat-
her they have worked to terminate
the expression of all “capitalistic”
and “military" viewpoints,

This time the “left” miscalculai-
ed, and rather than ferment Student
unrest in favor of them, itpolarized
opinion against them. In a proud
display of principled deliberation,
many students, most of whom have
no interest in joining or supporting

Clarification

It should have been pointed out in
the article in the 86:3 last week
entitled “Much Stolen FurnitureRer
turned” that college maids looking
for missing furniture in dormitory
rooms over Christmas break were
directed to do so and were not doing
so under their own initiative.

Furthermore, maids are still asked
to look for such furniture should
they have occasion to enter students
rooms even now.

the military, urged that in the name
of free speech the MarineRecruiter
be allowed to come and show his
wares.

in response, the leftists contended
that the military uses its power
to extend fascist imperialism and
therefore has no right to recruit.
The power of the argument is that
if there is no right to murder,
then there’s no right to recruit
murderers In the first place such
an argument has no force among
those who recognize that the m i-
tary is in no way the imperialist
right arm of a fascist government.
Secondly to those who hold a more
moderate anti»military position, the
counter to the leftist position. is that
now that we are about to have
an all volunteer army, it is imperr
ative Ihat students from colleges
like Grinnell enlist in an effort
to involve the kind of leadership
that is necessary to reshape the
army. Those who accept the left's
critique of the military yet invoke
the name of freedom of speech to
support the Marine's right to re—
cruit, employ a strained logic.

while some leftists on campus
have argued that is is “tactically"
a mistake to oppose the presence
of a marine recruiter on campus,
on the grounds that it would set
a precedent for keeping leftist spear
kers off campus, the fact the mem»
bers of the left would oppose the
Marine‘s presence is a living tes-
timony to their opposition of an

“open” campus.

Whereas the Trustees, being the
owners of Grinnell College, have
the right to keep any persons they
choose. off the campus, hopefully
they will not be bullied by students
into exercising their option. If this
affair is extended, or if a'similar

issue occurs it will be a tragic loss '

if students don’t rally in defense
of an “open" campus and freedom
of expression, for the loser will be
you.
