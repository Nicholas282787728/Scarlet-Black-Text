‘Sounding Board’ Critiques Sago

hy'Kyle Schaub

Sounding off at Grinnell is a fav-
orite student pastime, and theComr
mittee on Facilities and Food Ser»
vice wants to hear about it via the
Sounding Board,

The idea was conceived last sem-
ester in response to a number or
problems. The chief concern, aces
Drding to studentcommittee member
John Turnbull, was “to correct

‘ things as fast as possible andmain-
tain a running improvement in Quad
and Cowles.”

Bob Creasey, another student
member, outlined additional prob-
lems. He said that response to the
semester surveys was inadequate
and that students were ignorant of
the committee’s existence andtuhcr
tion. Also, low ratings oi the Food
Service in general lead to the Sam
unding Board as a more direct cor
mmunication line to the committee

Ralph Pomerenk, administrative
supervisor or Food Service and
member of the committee, stated
that Saga realized that they are not
going to give universal satisiaction,
but that the Sounding Board should
help to alleviate or eliminate stur
dent gripes.

All of the filled-out torms are
read by the committee in its open
Thursday meetings held weekly in
Forum PDR E at 3 pm.

The committee members include
Pomerenk, Creasey, Turnbull, and
two other Students, Jen Jenkins and

To Speak

Foreign correspondent Gloria Em-
erson will give this year's Rosenr
field Lectures, ,

The award—winning journalist will
speak on the vietnam problem and
the national interests of the United
States, The topic will be divided
into two talks to be given at a pm.
on Sunday and Monday.

The annualRosenneld Lectureship,
established in 1934 by Mrs. Meyer
Roseniield of Des Moines, is one of
the most important public lorumsat
the College.

This year’s speaker is a lormer
correspondent for the New York
Times with extensive experience
in the Southeast Asian field, She iS
widely published on the subject of
Vietnam and is presently writing a
book on the effects of the Vietnam
conﬂict on America andAmericans.

Neal ’Frabich. Saga managers Jerry
Ramaker, Tom Dickson and Dave

McConnell attend the meetings, but
are not committee members.

The constructive critical comm-
ents are put on iile for iuture core
rection and reference. Creasey said,
“Comments like ‘This‘tasteslike
paper’ don't tell Saga how to im—
prove it. Comments need tobemore
specific such as ‘This sauce isn’t
spicy enough’ belore something can
be corrected.”

Two problems whichthe committee
acted upon in its first meeting
this semesterwerecumplaintsabout
the imitation cheese and the limited
choice of salad dressings. The ch-
eese was immediately removed and
blue cheese dressing began to appr
ear alter a student requested it.

Over 300 forms were collected
for the lirst meeting and Creasey

Gary oiers appears pleasantly sur
the “First Barereet of the Year”
degrees Tuesday, and winter weary

reported that the ieedback was 2:1
on the good side.

If a' problem such as “sour milk
in cow #1” should be reported,
the student committee member wo-
uld act immediately and warn Saga
personnel. The committee collects
the sheets daily and keeps the b0,
ards treshly supplied with paper
forms,

Pomerenk was responsible for ties
signing the forms and setting up the
stations in each otthe dining halls.‘

in November, Quad dining hall was
the Scene of the ”party to end all

acts of Vandalism in the early mo-

1,000. Approximately 20 highschool
students were present but left 0i
their own accord by 10:30 p.m.

Day asserted that the last minute
cancellation by the band, Joint Ses‘
sion was the main problem,because
the band was promoted as theparty’s
central attraction. An hour prior to
the dance, a member of the band
called nay trom Kansas city to
report that bad weather had made
travel impossible. Efforts werethen
undertaken to obtain another band
but the Des Moines band contacted at
8:30 p.m , arrived at 12:30 a.m.

Thermostats in that year were not
subject to mandatory lower settings,
while this vear’s settings were brr

Money Woes
Perturb SGA _

by John Turnbull

Minor difficulties arose this week
concerning student government’s
access to the $25 per student acti-
vities lee that comprises its major
source oi income.

Robert Anderson, treasurer of the
college, commented at Tuesday’s
meeting of the Student Publications
and Radio Committee that he would
not authorize further allocation at
these monies until SGAAuditorMark
Walderhaug had issued the requir-
ed mcnthly budget reconciliation
statements for last semester.Supp-
osedly, Anderson’s warning was si-
mply a remindert to the auditor
to lullill his bookkeeping responsi-
bilities.

Upon a check of the financial rec»
ords, Ed Hirsch, SGA treasurer,
reported that nothing was amiss
and all that was involved was a
little catchrup bookkeeping.

The regular meeting of the Joint
Boards was headed by Ellen Yack-
nin while Scott Well Stayed home
with the flu. At the meeting, hous-
ing recommendationswereapproved
which included provisions for new
noanAGA housing options. For off-
campus people “somewhatlibelous”
information has been compiledfrom
surveys taken of students about
their apartments in town and is
available from Jim Tederinan.

Assistant Dean of Student Aﬂairs
Bob Jacobs also reported that fin»
alization of a combination trans-
portation and tick'etreservationser-
vice from Grinnell to ' events in

Ames, lowa City and elsewhere
is nearly completed.

One last report came from Mike
Darragh, a member of the Public
Events Committee. He remarked
that in the last two years $480
has been cut from a budget that
once totalled $1300. The existence
and funding of the committee is in
yeopardy‘ and the question or con—
tinuing the input or SGA funds will
come up at next week’s meeting of
SGA.
