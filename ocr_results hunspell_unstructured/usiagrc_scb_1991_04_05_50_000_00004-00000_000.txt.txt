Just between us?

The sexual assault workshops on March 11 and 12 laised awareness of
an essential campus issue. The broadness of the definitions of sexual
harassment can never be over—emphasized, and with continued campus
supportand participation in such workshops, students may beabletoleam
how to better avoid potentially hazardous situations and how to report
incidents of sexual harassment. Moreover, a sympathetic environment
should be provided for the complainants. However, how closed should
this sympathetic environment be. and who should have access to inforr
mation about sexual harassment on campus?

The idea of "dead silence," or limited conﬁdentiality. restricts the
complainant's discussion of the offense to close confidantes (resident

advisors, student advisors. facility
and close friends) in order to avoid S TAP l:
E D ITO RIAL

slandering or stigmatizing the de-
fendant. But what message does
this "dead silence" send concerning
the complainant's need for help?

The students who conducted the workshops suggested that the confir
dentiality rule should be relaxed to allow the names of offenders to
become public knowledge. In other words, the students believe that this
information should be available to whomever wants it. However, such an
allowance carries with it the connotations of a blacklist and could
prejudice actual legal proceedings.

Instead, the complainant and defendant should be able to discuss his/
her situation beyond close confidantes aftera verdict has been reached by
either the President's Hearing Board orludCo. There should be no risk of
slander to either party. In a court of law. the freedom to discuss a crime
is granted to both parties; sexual harassment should be treated as such by
the college.

But, the fact that the President's Hearing Board and JudCo are not
courts of law is a fundamental problemin the treatment of sexual harass-
mental Grinnell College. Both entities are set up so that the complainant
can get recourse as quickly as possible, Yet this leaves room for possible
injustice and bias; the defendant must also be considered. If a person
believes he/she is a victim of sexual harassment by another person on
campus, then he/she should report it to the police, If the case is tried at
Grinnell. itis importantthatboth complainantand defendatllreceiveequal
treatment. both irt the eyes of their peers and the college.

Student supports Profquotes The future of

To the editor,

As former manager of the
Profquotes board. I feel obliged to
addess issues ofsecurity andGCCS
policy raised in the last issue, in
which administrator Bill Francis
was quoted as saying that
Profquotes was "dangerous“ and
was being run covertly from
another's account.

The account in question he-
longed to Nadia Abdel-Wahab '90.
who gave me written permission to
use it until Dean Duke answered
her permission to sponsor

Profquotes. He never responded,
and when we met he seemed to
have forgotten the issue. If Nadia‘s
permission wasn't sufficient, why
did Mr. Francis tell me in mid-
Febniary that Profquotes would be
reinstated with minoradj ustmenls?

He commented, ironically, that
the campus "needed to lighten up"
regarding the computers. Since
then, we have seen the overzealous
enforcementof an absurdly restric-
tivepolicy. GCCS has even broken
its own policy in its fervor to apprea

COMMON St
Against racial dot).

While Noah Rose's column
contains some of the better writing
tn the Scarlet and Black. it recently
has fallen afoul of reality, In his
piece of March 8, Rose contended
that the raclultsi and separatist
pronouncements of Louis
Farrakhan are merely a response to
some vast, ”ingrained"—and, I
might add, vaguely dcﬁncdﬁfaCr
ism afflicting American society.
After this backhanded defense of
Fanakhan’s excesses, he criticized
political conservatism for exacer-
bating American racism.

No one would deny that racism
exists. However, most blacks who
are aware of this do not react by
lashing out at an alleged Jewish
conspiracy. or by extolling one of
history’smoslreprehensibledicia-
tors,orby calling foraviolentrevo-
lulioti to bring down whitey. These
can scarcelybe dismissed as under-

standable “reactions to American
society" when they are manifest in
only a radical splinter of the black
Community, the rest of which,
whatever complaints it mighthavc,
does not embrace Farrakhan. A
good indication of the gap between
the Nation oflslam and otherblacks
is that members of the Nation of
Islam assassinated Malcolm X af-
ter a dispute between him and the
organization, Furthermore, during
