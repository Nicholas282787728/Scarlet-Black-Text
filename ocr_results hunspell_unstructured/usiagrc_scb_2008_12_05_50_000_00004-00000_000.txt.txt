What kind orwork do you do in relation to AIDS in Nnt
mibin?

The workI do in relation to AIDS is that I’m a volunteer
for an organization called catholic Ale Action, It's the large
est non~ptoﬁt organization in Namibia, and they have orphane
ages to. registered orphans or nilnerahle children,

An orphan is someone whose mother and father
have died ofAIDS. They are either living with a

they have to get themselves to school; they have to
ﬁnd their own food.They usually have a place to
stay ar night, but there‘s a lot of physical abuse and
alcoholism.

We take care of vulnerable children. A vulnert
able child is someone whose mother and father may be alive
but may be so sick with HIV or have fulltblown AIDS and so
they’re too weak to take care of the children. So. with Catholic
AIDS Action they have 20,000 registered as an orphan or a
vulnerable child, In one of the townships, they have a center,
and I run an afterschool program for the children,

The ﬁrst thing I do in the morning is ride my bicycle
around looking for children who are not in school, and I talk to
them, and try to get them back in school. At noontime, when
the children get out of school, they come directly to the center
and we have a big soup and bread program, And after that, we
have games.They can play sports or educational games in the
computer room. We also have arts and crafts and choirs, I do

that until about 6:00 at night.
When I'm not doing that I give workshops to teachers and
I help them make educational games.

Howareyou able to volunteer in Namibia? How would a
Grinncll st-utlentbc ablc to come and volunteer with you?
WolLI myselfam a volunteer supported by donations from
my family and friends. At first I thought, maybe Id go to At-
rica for a year or so and iftlie money ian out rhar my family and
friends gave me. I would go home, But, so many people are just
so happy to support me and are so happy with the workl do.
I live really simply, I have a room in a house filled with
students and I’m like the house mommy. So, my
rent is really lowl title .1 bicycle and I just do a
lot of house sitting and things like that. I try to

get it. And I really want them to get it for their
healtlicatc or their education. So, in essence, I'm
a volunteer. I don’t have a house, a cat, or a credit
card. I love what I do.

And as fat as someone eoming [to volunteer],
anyone who wants to can come and join me. There is really no
red tape or forms to sign. Ifyou’re willing to live as simply as I
live, then you can come ovei with just abaut nothing

grandparent, a neighbor, or a very distant relative. really keep my costs down because I really feel lrke
so, a lot of the children have nobody to take care ‘ every penny every dollar that everyone gives moi
of them. They are our on the streets all day long; itspent on myself, then that means the kids don't

Namibia is along way from Grinncll. why and how were
you able to come here to speak?

Well, World Aids Day was this past Monday, and a very
dear friend ofmine is a professor at the [University orWiscon-
sin] And she asked me ifl would come to Wisconsin and give
a presentation for World Aids Day At ﬁrst I said, “No,I can't
really/justify coming around half the world to give a presenta-
rion." And then I thought about it. I [iealized] that part of my
responsibility ‘is not only my work over there, but it's spreading

the word here. And that maybe coming back here would result
in getting more students to come over there.

I feel like education is the greatest way to build world peace
and unity because education means knowledge and understand
ing and understanding means respect for other people's cultures
and ways otlite. And, so I think part of myjob is to be [in Net
mibia] and part ormy job is to he here telling the stories.
