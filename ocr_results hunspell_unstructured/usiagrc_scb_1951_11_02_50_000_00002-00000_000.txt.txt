A Case of Self—Government

. . |
The l'uture existence 111 student government at 6111111011

college is now completely in tile hands 01' the students.
\"\"hethe1 silcll 0m'elumcnl is retained depends entirelv upon
the students and especiallv upon the pel s0n111 Iinte '
each membe1 01 the E 01 HP,

Because llag’lant violations 01' the 111111111113 11110 occnil'ed
at liotlsepai'tie, S tllr ' night. the council \ lorced to
take 11 definite 51111111 ill order to form a ullited gloup. Ren-
ll/1iiig the necessity tor a strong and decisive policy, they (16‘
eided that any plesident unable to control the men 01' his
hall 11111 be removed from ofﬁce, Under such conditions, tlle
dorm will be placed ulldel the control 01' the administrav
tioii ulltil it is determined tllat the hall is again ready for
salt government.

We leel that the C 01‘ HP, the only effective power in
student government on campus, took a step l'rom which
they had no rec-our, , BuL neveltlleless, tlleir step illust 1th
the beneficial aims of the council. It is evident that the sue
cess 01 sucll a law depends 011 the individual members of the
coun '1 and the loyalty
their halls.

We are 01' the firm opinion that President Samuel N.
Stevens was altogether serious when he stated he would
destroy student government if it failed to enforce the rules
of the college »

There are these ,who feel that student government is
nothing but a puppet organization. We, however, choose to
call it7 en in its lesser 5811567 buffer between students
and .administration. As sncll, it receives maily of the blows
that might otherwise be directed toward the student body.
For this reason alone, it is \l'ol‘thwliile,

With this new law, student government stands on the
brink of success or failure, We hope it will succeed.

Where We Stand

Misintel'pretation sometimes arises from controversial
editorials. Such was the result of the editorial on conti'ible
tions which appeared in last week’s 3&1}. Because of that
inisliltel'pl'etation, the editors and editorial board of the
5&8 regret that the article appeared during- tlie annual drive
for the World Student Service Fund.

We had no intention of hampering 01' obstructing the
drive. The space we have alloted to \VSSF in each edition of
the paper should be evidence 01' our lack of ill-l'eeling' toward
the campaign, We lealize that \VSSF is all organization
worthy 01' support by college students. We ale aware that
our parents do not contribute to the drive. “e s 11 feel,
however. that an excessive number of pleas ale made l'ol'
our money,

For i'utnre \VSSF drives, we sugg, the omission 01'
individual quotas. The 11101 that students are asked to C0117
tribute $2 apiece seems to breed belligerency rather than
coopelation. 11' 11 quota for the entire college were ,e'ivcn i11-
stead, students would probably be more inspired to achieve
the goal.

while the editors oi the 5&3
have the: privilege of raising
their voices in protest againsl
campus practices which are det-
rimental to the student body,
they do not have the right to
distort facts and to disseminate

pose of \vr ing a eontroyerslal
editorial.

WSSF does no; bleed our par-
ents at home. It is an organizar
tion which appeals only to Stu
dents and their professors for
aid. It is the only significant
campus drive during the entire
school year vhich seeks more
than a dime. quarter, or half
dollar from each student,

The WSSF committee is not
trying m raise funds behind the
false fronts of housemeetings
and social pressure, It is at-
tempting to presem a great
'world need in i true perspec»
live, and is ule on: of provid
ing the 'tudent body with an
opportunity in help alleviate the
need.

Since the committee felt that
in past drives lhevre‘ was not suf-
i’lciont education on WSSF and
too much social v' ssure applied
in obtaining contributions, it was
decided that eel-,1 lional speeches
would be made at housemeetings.
with an invitation to make pei'r
sonal contributions at a future
date when each student would
be privately contacted. Two,
special solicitor meetings were
held before the launching of the
drive [01' the purpose of lush-urn
