to mention the case of Ethel Bybee.
u the gentlemen that Ethel asked
to the last woman’s vaisity were
placed end to end they would
stretch quite a ways indeed. Per-

who think that a Gridiron banquet is
a football pep meeting is deplorable.
Furthermore a man who jumps hole
is not a Hay Hnrdler either. In the
celebrated words of a celebrated

word pictures for movie mentalities.

for contrary to general rumor, it was
his foot that Bare put through the
glass.
