ror heartsmpping
ﬁnishes, no one can too the
2001 men's soccer team,
which played nine games
(diit of 14 on the schedule)

This years women's
teen however, is following
the same course so far.
Three of their first six
games were derided lay a
single goal, and two or
those were settled in
overtime. This is only the
beginning, tee; theyve got
nine more games seven or
