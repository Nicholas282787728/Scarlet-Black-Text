Record ‘Holding' Lawrence
Hopes For Championship

by Jim Wolf

“This is our year," says a

swimmer Barry Lawrence.
“With hard Work and a few
breaks we can come out on
top in the conference.”

The blondrheaded, crew-tut
senior hails from Wauwa-
tosa, Wisconsin. Gaining swim-
ming experience in three years
on his ‘high school team, Barry
has been a member of the
Grinnell team for four years

In his sophomore year he
established the varsity 440‘
yd. tree-style record at 524.6, ,
a record which he is out to ,
beat this year. 1

The Clark senior, cowapta'ln
of this year's swimmers, is a
member of Sigma Delta chi, was
on his house council last year,
and is like editor of the Cy-l
clone. The Honor G member,
says that one of the best my;
to get the most out of college

is by keeping busy and .get-‘comlpetltive swurnning. To keep
ting into activitiee. Barry is a‘ a peak of performance, a swim-
sociology major and plans tOlmer must keep training,

into personnel work afterlwhile in Florida we saw this
he serves his time with Uncle‘in some of the great swim-

go

Sam.

One of the highpoints of
the year for him was the
trip down to Florida over the
holidays with Coach Irv Si-
mone. The swimmers com-
peted in the Fort Lauderdnle

Sophomore Don Cassidav. just
recovered from a back injury
suffered last summer, is schedr
uled \to wrestle for Grinnell in
the heavyweight spot.

The Pioneers have'a one
and one record so far this
season, with n win oval-Ang-
nstana and a loss to the
University of Nebraska. The
Kohawhs dropped their open-
er to mighty Cornell and just
last week tied with Wart-
burg.

Coach Peterson has a gloomy
outlook and reports, ‘We’ve
been plagued by poor condi-
tioning and injuries ever since
Vacation.

Pioneer hopes [suffered a
severe setback this morning
when Peterson announced
that veteran 167-pounder
Gene Mayfleld prolmhly will
not see action due to a boil
on his right hand. Sophomore
Lee Savage will probably tee
place Mayﬁeld.
