- Cummins Easily

Carry State.

In one ol the most sweeping party
victories recorded for many cars, the
Republicans yesterday elected practi~

sally all oi their candidates {or ii

tional, state, and county oilices, ac-
cording to statistics available today.
The election of .i-ren G. Harding as
President was conceded at an early
hour last night. when he quickly
amassed a total of 275 electoral votes
from the ﬁrst states that were l-epoi

etl complete. Later returns greatly
increased the lead. ,

Predictions at local Republican
headquarte s are that Harding will
carry Iowa by a plurality of nearly
400,000, while Kendall, gubernaioiial
candidate will lead his opponent, Clyde
Hel‘lu‘ng, by something over 200,000.
The election of Senator A. B. Cummins
is also assured, according to G. 0. P.
headquarters.

Lone Democrat Elected.

Only one Democratic Candidate has
been reported successful. Indications
are that Dayton Gl'egson, Democratic
candidate for sherill‘ or Poweshiek
county, will lead his Republican nomi—
nee by a slight margin. n veiy close
vote is expected, the plurality being
only a. matter of less than 100 votes.

Reports of the election were recei -
all during the night at the Metropoli-
tan cafe, and interest was intense dur»
ing theentire night, although alter the
ﬁrst few hours little doubt of the out-
come ot the national election 6. stcd.

- Republican and Democrat workeis
were active during the whole day
Tuesday, calling at the homes of voters
to take them to the polls in alilamov
biles.

The organization is the result at
much talk on the subject for the last

Now that the smoke has clearcdl
away after Saturday's battles, one‘
team appears to stand head and shoul—

Saturday, they outplayed the Law-

In brief, Oklahoma needs only to
win from Kansa' and Kansas Aggics
to have a clear claim to the title.
Should she lose either or these games, |
the dope bucket will immediately be-
come badly mixed, with Kansas, Kau-
sas Aggles or perhaps Missouri as the
possible claimants. Ame: and Wash»,

most important change is that from

dates till ten o'clock any night. Tile
change was made upon the recom-
mendation of the executive board of
the w. s. G. A., which is similar to
the Grinnell w. s. G L. ‘

Much agitatio tor incl Lsed social
privileges had been current on the
campus for some time. The changes
will receive the support of the entire
college, it is believed by the student
paper. Recommendations have been
made that the number of social en—
gagements be restricted, and that a
high standard of scholarship be main—
teined.
