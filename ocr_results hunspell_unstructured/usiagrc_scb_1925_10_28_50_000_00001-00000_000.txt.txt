snatch o. 7»s victory from Grinnell
Saturday in the great homecoming
melee. ‘Flglltillg a plucky uphill bat-

the opportune time in the third quar-

The six points amassed by Grlunell
were the result 01 three safeties, two
of which were purposely donated by
the Bulldogs after they had been
backed up against their goal line
where tumbles would have proven
costly.

in spite of the soggy field and the

usually fast ind even. There were
few breaks and each team relied ups
on its speed tn win the game, As far
as a smooth working offensive is con-
cerned. crinnell outclassed the one
position in numerous ways, but the
football strategy of the Des Moilles
eleven proved the downfall oi the
Pioneers.

Although Griunoll threatened to
score several times during the game.
the real chalice was lost in the final
quarter when a drive down the field
was stopped near the goal line by a
fifteen yard penalty for unnecessary
roughness. An attempted drop kick
failed and Drake punted out of dams

BHEBUEIIY All! FAITH
IS NEW WSUBJEGI

Ill Long Chapel Monthly Morlllng Dit-
vis Attacks Beliei That Soil-ut-
ists Arc Incrednlous.

“Credulity and Faith.” was the new
topic which Dr. William Morris Davis.
Harvard exchange lecturer. took up
in his long chapel discussion, Monday
morning.

Dr. Davis attacked the common be-
lief that scientists were incredulous by
showing how it was necessary forthe
scientist to place a great amount of
crednlity in the acceptance or certain
natural laws. He illustrated this by
showing that in order to understand
how the earth moved around the sun
in a regular. elliptic orbit, it was
necessary to explain thc force which
held the earth in this orbit as it
whirled through space at the rate of
nineteen miles per second.

“We say the earth is held in place
by gravitation," said the speaker.
“But that does not mean that wc
know what gravitation is. We have
simply applied a special name to a
certain phenomena.” Since the thing
that hold the earth in place cannot be
explained. the scientist must believe
in this force simply because it must
be and because it is observed in our
er phenomena of nature.

Dr. Davis spoke of the uhdnlntol'y
theory of light waves. in order to be-
lieve which the scientist must be cv—
ti-aordinal-ily credulous. According
to this theory. countless numbers of
complex light beams can pass through
the same point in the ether. Vibrating
at a high frequency, and yet each
beam keeps its own identity. This
belief must assume a marvelous elas~
ticity as (I. characteristic of ether
which is able to transmit these many'
complex rays without destroying
their identity.

The speaker turned to the field of
geology for an illustration of the
faith of science. He said that the
whole study of geology was bascd on
the promise that time was continuous
throughout the past. and that nature
was not tricky. If two beliefs can.
flicted. one of which presumed a
tricky nature and the other a trusts
worthy nature, science took the latter
view simply on faith.

 

Dr. Davis Salli that in the Grand
Canyon one could see sections through
the earth's surface which would prove
the cal-Lb to be of great age. provid-
ing one bad faith in a continuous time
and a trustworthy nature.

ing Bill'ilrc noiucemucrs.

In a game marked by the character-
stlc closeness of its kind. the two
cams chosen from the prop squad fur-
.isliell some real excitement last Sate
urday morning. Before a large home-
coming crowd the freshman showed a
good brand of football. with the
Whites. captained by Van Fosseu. nos—
ing out a 7 to 0 victory over Don Pas-
Coe's Blues. The game was well
played. but the cold weather caused
frequent fumbles which played llfwfic
with the offensive of both teams.

At the outset of the game the two
teams battled on even term but
shortly before the close of the first
period a break allowed the Blues to
move into n scoring position. Ashby,
:ufoty man for the whites. fumbled
Julie's punt and Robertson recovered
‘t on the one-yard line for the Blues.
’ln the next play Wilson bit the Center
of the line. and lost the ball on a funi-
‘ilc to the Whites. Parrot kept the
Blues at bay tor the remainder of the
‘ltllf with some nice punts.

in the third quarter the Whites
opened up a flashy offense and a long
pass, Parrott to Ashby took the ball
into scoring position. and “Red” Fail
smashed it over for the only marker
of the game. Mcifenna was Success
tul in a placement for the extra point.

The remainder of the game lvns bard
fought, the Blues trying desperately to
even the score. and the Whites Sues
cessfully holding their seven-point ad-
vantage.

For the winners. Fail. Ashby and
Parrot bore the brunt of the attack.
Fall and Parrott bit the line with lots
of power and played strong defensive
games. while Ashby was putting in a
consistent game at halfback. 0n the
line the work of Captain Von Fossen
and Corbett was of high order and
they repeatedly threw the opposing
backs for losses.

For the Blues. Duke and Capt. pas-
coc showed up well in the backfield
with end runs and olfrtnclfle smashcs.
while the work of Robertson on the

“FAN THE FLAME"‘—SLOGAN

Students Must pledge Around uracil
to in o $4.800 Asked For
Piorlct-r Chest Budget.

The Pioneer chest drive whlch was
begun yesterday at chapel by Roger
LCaV‘lttp gained headway today at a,
special student chapel and will be in
full sway tomorrow when the actual
pledge campaign begins,

“Fan the Flame" is the slogan
which is being used by the Pioneer
Chest people to gain inouey for their
budget. About $4,500 is the amount
desired, $3,134 of which will be spent
for the Gri‘miell-in—China school. The
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. c. A. win re-

ceive $800 each and the bud will get
$75 as its share.

$6 to be Mel-age

Il‘ the dere is to be a Success the
committee in marge states that it
will be necessary for the students to .
average $6 a pledge. which will mean
that many will have to exceed the
average in order to make up for those
who cannot afford to give $6,

At yesterdays chapel, Roger Lea—
vitt, a Cedar Falls banker and a
prominent laymen of the Congrega-
tiollsl church, started the drive. He
urged every student to be of service
and to subscribe liberally and gener—
ously to the Gl‘illnell-in-China ﬂuid.
and to give the means through which
the work in China mily be carried on.

Students Overlook Gm!

“Many college students have over--
looked God." contiliued Mr. Le‘av-ltt.

“And have not learned the joy of giv-

ing." He told of the sacrifices which
both well known and obscure men
and women have made, so others
might be made happy. Miss Simmons
was one woman. of whom he said.
"She turd no thought of self, and it is
only through your sacrifices that she
can be repai . ‘

Money in itself is worthless. it is
only the human hands behind it that
can use it to change the lives 0! many
people. it seems unbelievable to Mr.
Leavitt that God should love man
with that most wonderful and bean-
tiful of all loves. Dur g the World
war the willing‘sacr ices which men
made of their lives, over-shadowed
the srmtll sacrifices which people
make today for the War of Sin. but
these sacrifices are tremendously im-
portant, for without them the work
can not be carried on.

Students Speak

At chapel this morning‘ students
stressed the point that everyone
should give to the Pioneer Chest.
Irene Whirl-y spoke in behalf of the
Y. M. C. A, Walter Ingram represent-
ed the Y. M. C. A. and Alden Green
appeared for the band Dean J. S.
Nollen said u few words in behalf of
the Gl‘inuell—ianhiua movement.

A special chapel will be held to-
morrow and students will be asked to
pledge throughout the play. A sur-
prisc chapel will be in store Friday
and it is probable that the results of
the drive will be announced then. The
committeesexpect to wind up the en-
tire drive within the next two days,
if possible.
