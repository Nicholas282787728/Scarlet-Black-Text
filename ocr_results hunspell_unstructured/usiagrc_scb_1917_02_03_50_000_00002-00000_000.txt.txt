It is a little unusual ior The Scarlet
and Black to go outside of the realm
of college news, hilt we think it is
proper when we can give service to
our subscribers in that line. Today we
are printing a piece of national news
and getting it to our subscribers as
soon as, or before, any other newspae
per can do so,

Why does John Galsworthy select a
student to lead a disorderly mob in
his play, “The Mob,” presented last
night? Does a student typify disorderi
is this why he is chosen to lead a
murderous nioh, a group of infuriated
citizens, to a man's home. there to kill
because the victim has the strength of
character to stand behind his convic—
ﬁlms? Or is a student the most likely
pel'soll,7\vl'tl.i his youth, his energy,
his quick decision—to have risen to
the leadership of such a group of evrlr
doors?
neither of these, but is more Signifi-
cant still.

Groups of students are not charac-
teirced by mob violence. Nor is a stir-
dcnt more .likely to become a mob
leader than all‘oltler head, one whose
natural position in the community is
more out of leadership, There are
hoilbtless stronger psychological prin-
ciplcs which have prompted Galswor-
thy to do as he di

lo the play i .
two kinds of opinions typified. one
was the product of ones self, which in
the case of Stephen More happened to
be opposed by a mob; the other was
that of others which seemed to be on»
controllahly adopted as plies own with-
out individual thinking. This latter
was the mob spirit typiﬁed by the stue
dent.

ls Galswul'tliy’s riiob student typical
in Gl‘lnnell? Yes, we think he is. The
number of college men and poorer
who adopt the opinions of other as
their own is not at all small. in this
there is a difference between the The
finance of others iii helping the indi-
Vldllul form opinions, and in thoughts
lessly adopting the mental products
of others The former i inevitable;
the latter can bc avoided.

It is just a certain stage in a man's
or a woman's life. At one time he ac—
cepts the thinking or others without
alteration. Then, when he has [iro-
grcssed to a higher state of mental t'lce
velopmeirt, he terms his own convic-
tioiis, and they drive him true as stccl
to their mark, These are the kind ol
men who bring forth new ideas. who

course of progress. Nearly always
they meet with sonic opposition, yet
they inet'itably accomplish deeds This
kind of man is the highest type to
strive to become.

There arc many student niub leaders
in Grinnell. Why not more Stephen

Mares?

‘ Nothing has been more needed in
Grinnell than some sort of a system
of improving English standards of
students For that reason, today's our
nouiicemeirt of riciv English require-
‘rneiits is to be highly commended and
it should meet with immediate a1)-
proval on the part of those whom it is
intended to help.

.Briefly, the system is simple. it a
student in any course is found writing
poor English, a faculty committee will
recommend to hiur that he take cer-
tain English courses Also another-
class is added for the benerrt of new
students who are deficient in this sub-
lect.

The plan is distinctive. Defi rent
upperclassmen are not to he thrown
into a class of only def ients. Such
would destroy all incentive to work,
instead, they are put iirto the same
groups with better students. This will
give them encouragement in their
work. it is this which makes the
plan different than that of other cul—
leges and which makes itnrie of the
most valuable of recent clinngos'in the
curriculum.

The plan is of immense value. May
its aims be strongly supported,

THE NEW FEATURE.
Frequently the question is asked by
the student, ”Who is president of this
college organization?" Often the query
is put by the business man, "Who is

at the head of that college ol‘gallizax ’

tion?“ For the convenience of these
people. which include almost all of
our local subscribers, we are today
printing as a supplement to our home
edition a new feature which we hope
will supply the needs of these per-
sons. We are issuing a “College Dr-
ganization Directory” which gives the
names and positions of the officers of
all local college organizations. May
the new feature prove useful.

N0, the reason is pl‘obabIY,

BE A GOOD SI’OR'
Remember at the game tonight:
Don’t cheer when a foul is called.
Don't hoot at your opponent.

Cheer for only sliilliiil playing,

Encourage the Grinnell players.

Cheer for the visitors occasionally.

Show that you are a good sports—
man.

“One cannot speak this irror irig
without having in mind the great nae
tional crisis in which we stand; the
greatest since 1851." Tins was the
statement made by Professor James
Hardy Ropes, the Harvard Exchange
professor, in chapel Friday morning.

"Our fortune, our life, the welfare of
this nation, or this college and or this
community, depends upon the course
which men's thoughts take in Wash»
ingtoii this morning,” he said,

The speaker pointed out that the
people of Europe have had the reality
of life brought to them and that rear
ity is not death. but tho last that they
belong to a great whole from which
they cannot escape. "The greatest
whole is not our country," said Pres
lessor Ropes, “but it is devotion to
God. lor which this country is put lierc
to serve."
