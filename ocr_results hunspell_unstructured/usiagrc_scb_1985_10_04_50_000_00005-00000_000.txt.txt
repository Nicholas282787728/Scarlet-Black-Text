Did you know that in the United States
alone a woman is beaten every l8 seconds,
and that one out ot every iour women is
severely abused by their husbands or liv-
ing partners? Whether or not you are
dating someone, you will want to know how
to avoid being involved in an abuse rela
tionship... how to know if a boyfriend or
girlfriend has the potential to abuse you ,.
where to go for help if you or a friend is
abused or abusive. Here are eight simple
signs that may clue you in to potential
abuse. ,

Was there physical, emotional or sexual
abuse in the home as they were growing
up”! You should be aware that before you
become Seriously involved with someone it
is important to ﬁnd out about his or her
childhood. If there was physical, emo
tional or sexual abuse in the home the
chances are greater that this person may
be inclined to battering.

What was their relationship with their
parents like as they were growing up?
Research shows that a significant number
bl abusing men and abused women ielt
they had poor relationship with their
parents while growing up. A man par-
ticularly may have grown up feeling emo»
tionally abandoned, causing him to leel re-
Jected. lrustrated, and inadequate. He
may teel anger toward his parents which
he takes out on his girlfriend or spouse
later in life

What is their view of Iiizilc and [eliiaic
roles? Those who are prone to abusive
relationships often believe in traditional
sex role sterotypes. Abusive males may
believe that "a woman's place is in the
home". that beating is a man's “right”
and an effective way of .teaclling his
girltrieiid oi- wile a lesson The abusive
male tries to live up to the “‘supcrmaclio”
image and sets unrealistic goals for

himself. When he can’t reach these goals
he feels even more inadequate and
frustrated. Having never learned to deal
with his ieelings in socially acceptable
ways, he iinally releases his pent-up ten»
sions and fears in violence against his
girltricnd or spouse.

Are they overly possessive or threaten-
ing? Abusive men are unusually
possessive over “their” women; they show
extreme jealousy even when there is not
sufficient cause to be jealous. The woman
may welcome this behavior as an indicar
tion oi loyalty and a type oi iniormal com-
mitment, As the relationship continues,
the possessiveness increases. l-le en-
courages her to stop seeing her friends and
to become increasingly devoted to him
alone, which gives him a sense of exclusive
authority over her.

no they have a criminal record? A
criminal record, particularly tor agv
gravated assault, is a strong indication
that this person is abusive and prone to
battering. Even if there is no criminal
record, a person with a reputation for get
ting into lights probably believes that

violent behavior is acceptable.

What are their drinking habits? Since
drinking and physical abuse are highly
correlated, this is something you want to
look into. This is not to say that drinking
causes abuse, but the fact that they are
related suggests it would be wise to iind
out whether or not the person has a drink-
ing problem.

Are they violent with objects? Do they
throw, smash or vandalize objects? This is
also a good indication of unusual
abusiveness and a tendency toward hatter-
ing, It is likely that this abusiveness will
not be limited to inanimate objects, and
will eventually show itself in relationships
with people, particularly those who are
close.

Are they cruel to animals? Research and
case studies or battering relationships
show that abusers often display unusual
cruelty to animals, This can range lrom
neglecting an animal (withholding tood,
water or affection), to slapping, kicking,
or yelling at an animal, to extreme forms
of cruelty such as beating br torturing
animals.
