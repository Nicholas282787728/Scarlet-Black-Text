EAST HiGH-GR‘iNNELL TODAY,

First Game Today»Field in Bad Shape.

The lirst iootball game of the season
will be on Ward Field this afternoon
. and although it is generally cdnceded
that lirinneil will win there is no
doubt but it will be a close and
teresting game. Coach Hamilton has
kept the team hard at work all week,
giving tiieir still scrimages both Wed
nesday and Thursday nights. the
latter despite the cold drizzling rain,
Last night signal practice was held in
the gymnasium, and the team might
be said to be in good ear-ly'season form
although the plays are as yet, loose
and the scrubs have generally been
able to hold them fairly well.

It is probable that there will be
many substitutions in today’s game
on Grinnell's part as is indicated by
the large or men who have been
ordered out in uniform. Brundage
who has been running the team in
action style recently will start at
quarter with Ziegler at full and 'Bair
and Turner at halves. Bleamaster
going from half to right tackle, while
Peirce will be moved from guard to
left tackle. Campbell and Hanson
willplay the guards with Flanagan
and iiicCarty at ends, Sparks will
probably play the center.

The East high squad arrived in the
city this morning sixteen strong in
charge or Coach Auracher and Asst.
Coach Valerins. They are a lucky
looking bunch and appeared to be
capable of a good game. Although
neither at the coaches or captain
Turbey would venture a guess as to
the‘oulconde. The team averages
about 1.30 pounds. The probable line~
upfollows: r.e, Weluh: r.t.,Fos—
ter: r. g,, R. Stiles: c,Brown; l,g,
Eaton: l.t. Carlson: l. e, Wilkins
and Johnson; q.ib,, Bredimus; r. b,
Baird: l. b, Turbey. (Caper f. b,

The ﬁeld is not in the hestcondition,
due to‘the recentrains, hint this will
not detract irom the comfort of spec-
tators and although it will make the
game slow, will make it none the less
interesting. It behooves every loyal
son and daughter of old 'Grinnell to
start the season right by watching
this game and getting aline on the
190-. Varsity which promises to be the

best, in years.

WOMEN'S CLUE TO AID
ENDOWMENT.

The Wellare of Iowa College has
beenmore or less the dominant idea
among the people or Grinnell ever
since the Booster movement last
spring. butinterest in the school and
especially in the endowment fund,
has received a marked impetus in the
action inst taken by the Women’s
clubs. All the literary antisocial clubs
in Grinneilhave organized under an
executive board made up or the presi-
dents, and enthusiastic work has be.
gun toward raising a fund to be given
over to the endowment in June.
Several pledges have been made al—
ready. This movement is especially
to be appreciated in college circles
inasmuch as many of those who have
entered the work have heretofore felt
no interest in the college. »

CHAPEL TALK.

Professor Stoops spoke at Chapel
ir‘riday morning upon the value and
purpose of systematic Bible Studyf
There are two methods of studing the
Bible, one the historic, or Scholar’s
method: the othetthe evangelical, or
method {or getting material to throw
light npon religous experience. By the
historic method is not meant to
merely study the Bible as history or
historic literature for it is more than
history and more than literature. As
we look to the Greeks for art and
literature, to the Romans for law and
socialiostitutions, so we look to the
llebrews for our ioiindations in moral
and reiigous teachings. Hence the
necessity to understand the develop-
ment of Hebrewllfeifwe ore to un-
derstand their religous and moral
teachings. It is only by getting the
historic point oi view that we can
understand the teachings of Moses
and at tiie same time catch the. toil
signiﬁcance of Jeremiah and Ezekiel.

rand later appreciate the teachings of

Jesus. ’

‘ A person may, however ave master.
ed the Bible from ‘a historic point of
view and yet be an agnostic or proA
less some non-Christian form of re»
ligion. Hence there is the necessity
of the evangelical method Bible
Study must throw some light upon
ourreligiousexperience‘as well as to
help us to understand whattiie Bible
is It matters notso much whether
the prodigal son actually lived as
viietlierwe get the moral teaching of
ihe pavable Itis notso much what
is said in the story or the creation as
a at the author meant to teach.
The Bible student must not only use
the ll'sEOriC method, but he must join
with it the evangelical method, and
by taking the religous attitude con.
stantly strive to throw some light
upon his inner personal experience,
else the real purpose of systematic
Bible Study is not attained.
