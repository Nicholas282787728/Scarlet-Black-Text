Puts Taboo on. Intercollegiate
Athletics for Girls and Na.
tional Point Plan.

A’The W‘ A. conterence last week-
end proved to he very hclplul,” declar-
ed Jessie Cutlcr, chairman oi the nor
semhly, and president at the Grinnell
Women's Athletic association.

The representatives ol eleven Iowa
colleges met here Friday and Satur
day to discuss the problems at the
\v. A. A. They came at the invitatioi
of the local w. A. A. tor the lirst con-
tcrencc Of its hind in the state.

“The girls agreed,” continiied'JesA
sie Cutler, that they would like

The larger schools are planning to
semi delegates to the national con-
vention in Caiiforn' in the spring; so
the next meeting will he held earlier in
the year, that
smaller schools may benefit by the re-
ports."

Among the questions discussed, was‘
intercollegiate athletics for girls. The
’Oma
.lanet

coulei'enCo was not in favor of the
plan. Intercollegiate athletics, they
decided, tends to destroy the spirit or
good sportsmanship, limits athletics
from all the girls of the school to a
very low. Among these few, athletics
are overdone.

,The conference decided not to as
dept, ii: a state, the national point
system, since it seems to he adopted
to large schools only. The plan is al-
ready in use at Iowa and at Ames, so
the conference worked out a system
whereby first team points can he
translerrod to schools using the has
tional point system.

Various plans for raising money
were suggested. An idea which has
been a. success elsewhere and which
may he tried here, is the sale at an-
pies in the gym according to the self-
sewc honor system which is used in
Selling candy bars/at the dormitories

and Quadrangle.

Mr,‘ and Mrs. R. B. Leachman and
