BYTESSA CHEEK

Last weekend ten Grinnellians interviewed inmates in
Mitchellville's Iowa Correctional Institution for Women,
asking detailed questions Ihont their hIston ofviolencc Ind
vIctimization.

Organized through Domestic Violence Alternativcs/
Sexual Assault Center (DIVA/SAC), Sm,
dent volunteers will continue to interview
potential candidates for commutation
assistanceihelp towards reducing prison
sentencesi through the Skylark program.
an initiative of the lowa Coalition Against
Domestic Violence (ICADV).

Through the Skylark Project, so worn-
en It Mitchellville will pIttIcipIte In I
three-tiered interview process to examine
causal links between domestic violence oi
sexual assault Ind the crime {or which they were convicted.
Once a connection is established, ICADV helps strengthen
inmates arguments for decreasing their prison time.

According to Katie JIrcs '07, the lCADV project coordi»

the second interview to create a profile for us about the oft
fendei‘s history ofvictimization,"]ares said,

According toJIres, the project's effect on the surrounding
eornrnunIty Ind the student intcrviewets. is just Is Important
as the legal and political processes Skylark is involved in.
“One of the main goals orthc project is to
educate people about how women end up
in this situation and just how ubiquitous
assault is In incaiceiated women," Jares
said.

The volunteers hope to exhibit the
strong inﬂuences that Ihuse Ind victinIizI
tion can have on the llmliltes' Convictions.
“These women arc offenders in the eyes of
the law but they Irc IIiso victims," said in—
terviewer Noga Ashkenazi '09.

Ashkcnazi said she IvIs drum to the pIoieet by Its
uniqueness in scope and a target population that is often
forgotten by service projects.

“When you think ot’ IetIvIInI, or volunteering even, you
rarely think of a population of inmates," AshkenuZi siiidI

“Piisons are located in the middle of nowhere, it's so easy for
us to look away, to not even think Ihout thcrrII"

Student Interviewers were trIIined to question inmates
about their histories of violence, and spent hours interview»
ing candidates “The IctuIl interview process was very in-
tense," said Cecilia Darby '12, who spent over two hours
intervieI ng inmates last weekend. “It was like nothing I've
ever done before.
The whole experience
