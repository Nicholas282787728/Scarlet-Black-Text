Sorry about signs

To rhe enrirc Grinnell campus,
1sineeroly apologize lfanyonc was oriended by a par.
rrcular Fencing adverrrscrnenr. 1 have already talked to many
or you about is and realize rhar rhe sign is in {nor being
interpreted on levels rhar 1 did nor consider when 1 posred
them. 1wanr so make it alsiindanrly clear rhar rhe sign does
nor represenr my beliefs nor do 1 condone rhe inrages and
behavior rhar ean he rnrerprered from rhe sign. 1 have :1»
ready raken down she signs in quesrion because I realized
rhar people were being orrended and beeause ir misreprer
senred who 1 am and gave rhe sporr ochncing a bad name,
1 was merely arrempring to appeal to peoples misconcep.
rions orswordsnaanship and movie sryle duels by using rhe

Lower drinking age

Dear Edison

Lasr week 1 bad lunch wirh rhe German Deparrrnenr
Language Assistant rrorn lasr year, Srerran Birkleoach, :tnd
rold him abour rhe Mary 15, James busr. 1r rook ahour lo
niinures before he realized rhar 1 was nor making rhis up.

His reaction makes sense. 1n Germany. people are al.
lowed ro drink beer ar 16 our rhey cannor drive unril 18. in
America, people ean drive an 16 bur nor drink unril 21.
Wouldn't ir rnoke more sense if people were rrusred ﬁrst
wirh somerhing rhar can make rhenr aer stupid, and rhen
were larer rrusred wirh deadly weapons.> Do nor forger rhar
over 40,000 Americans die in car wrecks every year. A car is
much, much more dangerous rhan a plasrie cup or
Milwaukee's Best.

No country in Europe has a drinking age ofover 18. 1r
is only because era ridiculous erusade by Morhers Againsr
Drunk Driving (MADD) in rhe 1970s and 19805 rhar
America has this regressive policy. Nobody likes drunk drivr
ing, bur if she srarisries are rigbr, drinking laws as rhey are
now cause more under 21 drunk driving rhan if aleobol
were legally available ro all Arnerican residenrs over rbe age
oils.

Bur Srerran's observarion ar rhe end or rhe conversa.
[ion was rnosr astute: "Grinnell PD has six cars?" 1 didn'r
rhink so either.

random Great films in bad order . Just wasting away?

Students speak
out about what’s
on their minds in
142 words, and
you're invited! If
you have a
random rant,
email it to
alward@grirlnell.edu.
After all,
complainaing in a
public forum is
always more fun
than doing it '
alone.

This semester, SGA has chosen some wonderful
ﬁlms. Thanks. Audrey etc, My complaint is the order
in which the reels are chosen to he played. Although
I really do enjoy seeing the very ending of a movie
before I see the rising action which built up to it, I
would prefer to see a film in the order in which it was
intended to be shown. I understand that this is
Grinnell College and we must break the Cycle of mo-
notony and challenge the dominant paradigm— but
please We spend lots of money to get these ﬁlms
shown on campus and we need to ensure that Stu»
dents reap the beneﬁts by watching the reels in their
original order, I don't want to know that someone is
sentenced to death BEFORE I even see her trial. I'm
not a Tralfmadon‘an— I travel forward through time.
Please support me in this.

It has recently come to my attention that, due to
my insane class' and activities schedule, I have very
little or no time left for essential functions like sleep-
ing and breathing. Before you dismiss this as just
another rant about stressful Grinnell life, my obscene
workload. and my imminent mental breakdown, read
my 142 words. Give me the open highway, a tank full
of gas, some Nutella, a beach with a friendly hippy
and a dog. Grinnell might challenge my mind to think
(or stay awake), but the world challenges my mind to
exist and live. we are all Dharma Bums searching for
something that will never be found in Grinnell.
Emerson said, ”Only so much do I know, as I have
lived,” Tell me Grinnell, how many of us are actually
living and how many of us arejust wasting away?

0 - as a
In pra15e of narvete
. Does it negate the spirit of a rant to be positive?
I don’t think ranting necessitates negative emo-
tionse I think I can he just as impassioned happily
as I can angrily. So, I’m happy. Despite all the
lurking and looming papers which are ofﬁcially
assigned and therefore unignorable, I'm excited. I
think it has something to do with my new bicycle,
or the/warm air, or the hat that I'm still somehow
idealistic about the world and contemplating the
possibility of staying that way. 1 know, I'm a ﬁrst-
year and maybe my faith in the world hasn’t been
properly shaken yet. It‘s a possibility. 01 maybe
I'm perfectlyjustified in being optimistic about life
today. I just don't like the whole attitude that my
disillusionment with the world is a pending
inevitability So I guess that’s what I’m muting
about, if this is a rant. 1 don’t want to feel foolish
to embrace my moments of idealism.
