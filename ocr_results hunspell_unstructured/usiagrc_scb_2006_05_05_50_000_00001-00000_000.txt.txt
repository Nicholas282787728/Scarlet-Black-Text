Kerry speech
tomorrow at 1:30

Iowa visit could signal another
presidential bid in 2008

KY Assv RAPOPORT

The last time SenatorJohn Kerry came to Grinnell,
400 people gathered in South Lounge to hear him
make a bid for the presidency Over the next few
months, this process will begin again as presidential
hopefuls will start making appearances in the hopes
ofgaining support in the 2007 Iowa Caucus.

This Saturday, Kerry will give a speech in the
Harris center couccrt Hall that some speculate will
begin a bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential
nomination.

Kerry's office contacted Grant Woodard ’06, the
president or the campus Democrats orAmerica, less
than two weeks ago to inquire about the possibility
of the speech. It was not until Monday that the visit
was conﬁrmed.

“He's basically coming to Iowa just to do this,
said Woodard According to Woodard, Kerry wished
to find a school outside the East Coast to give his
talk

“They picked Grinnell [for its] solid reputation as
politically active,” said Woodard. “Grinncll has a very
good progressive tradition.”

The speech, which Kerry is billing as a “major
policy address," will primarily concern the war in Iraq.
Woodard believes the speech will be similar to a talk
Kerry gave two weeks ago at Faneuil Hall in Boston,

“Alargetheme
of this speech
is going to be
dissent and
that dissent is
patriotic,"said
Woodard.

C h a s e
Martyn ’07,
co-leader of
the Grinnell
C a m p u s
Democrats, believes the topic of foreign policy will
resonate with students, even those who do not nor-
mally support Kerry. “He's going to be talking about
things 1 think our entire campus can rally around,"
he said.

Organizers hope to attract between 550 and 600
people, but it even more people may show up. Scare
ing is ﬁrsttcome, firsttscrve. Because of the speech’s
importance, national press will be on campus to cover
the event. Kerry has also sent out a state wide email
to his list of supporters inviting them to the talk.

Woodard did not get conﬁrmation ofKerry’s trip
until Monday, giving him less than a week to work
with Campus Democrats in organizing the event.

Martyn has worked with Woodard in almost all
stages ofplant

Martyn. For
this reason, a
team of at least 20 Grinnellian volunteers will aid the
Kerry staffin everything from parking arrangements
to letting people into the Harris Center.

Martyn is unsure how Grinnell students would res
act to Kerry as presidential nominee for 2008. From
what Ive perceived the campus has pretty mixed reel-
ings about him running again, but most people still
like him as aguy, he said

Iowa State Republican Party spokesperson Sarah
Saubcr said the purpose of the visit was electoral.

Wind turbine progress from trustees

CERA turbine approved; further study to precede turbines for the campus

av KWON YANG & DAVID MONTGOMERY

The price of oil climbs daily. Carbon emissions clog the atmo-
sphere, raising temperatures around the world. Brisk breezes sweep
unimpeded across the plains oflowa. For Eli Zigas '05 and Emily
Stiever ’09, these three facts add up to the need for Gtinnell College
to generate power from wind energy.

As of last weekend’s meeting of the Board of Trustees, their
dream is one step closer to reality. The trustees approved a small
Wind turbine at the Conard Environmental Research Area (CERA),
as wdl as comprehensive study of area wind speeds. Based on the
results of that study, the trustees could approve two large turbines
north ofcampus to provide power directly to the college.

According to campus Environmental and safety Coordinator
Jennifer Jordan, the study will look at wind data over the past 40
years and calculate expected wind speeds. The study will take two
months and be presented at the next trustee meeting.

The idea to put wind power on campus began nearly 10 years
ago with a research project by Mia Devine ’99. The idea was kicked
around until Associate Director of Facilities Management Rick
Whitney began to promote it.

In August 2005, President Russell K. Osgood created the Wind
Feasibility Committee with Whitney as the chair. Associate Librart
ian Gain Bonath, Maura Kathan ’08, Peter Jacobson, Biology, Lee
Sharpe, Chemistry, and Jordan were members. The committee sub—
mittcd a proposad for wind turbines in January.

After that proposal was submitted, Free the Planet began proe
muting wind turbines to students and alumni. Zigas and sticver
led the effort, presenting the various beneﬁts ofwind power to the
trustees.

"Everyone recognizes the environmentll bcncht, Zigas said.
“Another reason is that wind energy could provide economic SUV
bility tor the college. lfwe re producing our own energy we re lcss
reliant on the market."

The high cost of oil has made wind power more economically
feasible in comparison, since the cost ofconventional power is rise

ing.
Because the turbines will cost millions of dollars to build, even

substantial savings will take time to add up. The study predicted
that the small wind turbine to be built in CERA will break even
financiauy after 26 years, while the two large turbines proposed for
the campus would generate a 5.2 percent rate of return over their
40-year lifetime.

“I think the college is looking at this as a financial opportunity,"
said Zigas. “Not in the sense of stocks and bonds, but in the sense
of looking at the future of
electricity from the grid, and
whether perhaps it’s better if
we're not so reliant on the
grid.”

Though supporters hope
that most of the campus'
power will come from wind
energy and not fossil fuels,
it wouldn’t leave the campus
vulnerable to still days. The
college would remain connected to the power grid. on windy days
most of the college's power would come from the turbines, but when
the wind isn’t blowing the college would buy electricity as it does
now.

Zigas and Stievet worked with Free the Planet to collect more
than 800 signatures from students, faculty and alumni expressing
support for the wind power initiative. This petition was presents
ed to the trustees at their meeting in February. There the trustees
expressed support for the proposal but called for more study, Joint
Board also passed a resolution in favor ofwind power.

competition with peer colleges has also played into the debate.
Carleton College has a wind turbine on campus and St. Olaf Col-
lege is constructing one. “Our project would be bigger than rhcirs,"
Zigas said.

”Wind energy (nu/d provide ems
nomic slab/lily for the college. if
we’re producing our own energy,
we’re less reliant on the marker.”
