that. “It's really incredible that there
is that kindofenergy out there.“ Still,
Ness wants to diversify the group
already utilizing the center. She has
big plans.

The center was opened on April
23. 1989 as a resource center and
meeting place for women. Named
afterJeanneBurkle,aformer teacher,
artistandscholarwholivedinGrinnell
from 1958 until her death at age 58 in
1985, the center provides a support-
ive environment where women may
educate themselves. Events are sched-
uled weekly, with past topics ranging
from “Journal Writing“ to “At Home
with Your New Baby" and
“Demystifying the Physical Exam".
A support group for women is held
every Wednesday night. This month,
a party for children is being orga
nized to celebrate Hannukah and
Christmas.

The program topics are diverse,
with an emphasis away from strictly
“feminist" issues. Ncss emphasized

MIDDLE EAST: Army '

experts discuss policy ,

Encouraging democracy, he argued,
“mcans we have to take some risk. If
we allow some states to dcmocrauze,
they may notltke the United States."
But Ward also believes that“we need
tochztngeour perception oflslant and
Arab nationalism."

“Democracy in the Middle East is
not a threat to the U.S. Islam in the
Middle East is not a threat to the U.S.
Islam in general, I don’t believe, is a
threat to Israel, Islam never attacked
Israel . Egypt attacked lsrael - and it
wasn’t because oflslam,” said Ward.

Ward and Devlin discussed
American‘smoral commitrncntto the
self-determination of Israel. “They
have a right to a homeland," Ward
argued. The Colonels also talked
frankly about the GulfWar.

“You’re smart enough and I’m 4
smart enough to understand the un-
derlying factor in why we liberated '
Kuwait had to be oil," said Devlin. ,
While conceding that human righs
protections ln Kuwait and Saudi ‘
Arabia have fallen short of the ideal, -
they said the US. “can’t always fol- I
low a policy of human rights. Some-
timcsourownnzttionalinterestsoverr '
ride another factor." ,

Ducto the changes ln Mtddlc East
policy and the end of the cold war, ‘
Devlin and Ward said the Army will <
cut back its forces by roughly 25 '
percent. A “very mobile, very 1'1ch
iblc, very lethal" contingency core ‘
will be created in case crisis erupts. ,
Nevertheless, the Army doesn’t want
war, according to the Colonels. ‘

“We aren’t out there saberrrnt- .
tling," asserted Devlin.

STONEWALL: H / GRC renamed

phasis that will begin with an expan-
sion of the library. “Much of Stone
wallinvolvedblacksandLatinos.Wc
want to show that this constituency is
important, mat the Center is adopting
a multicultural focus, as well."
Ann~Louise Hank, student assisr
tam at the H/GRC, helped plan the
renaming ceremony as part of the
Gay/Lesbian/Bi Task Force and the
H/GRC advisory board. “The name
change is signiﬁcant because it ts a
namethatallmembersofthclcsbigay
community can identify under," she
said. Hank explained that Stonewall
is a more acceptable term, rather than
gay orqueer,becauscsomclind those
words offensive or exclusive. On the
other hand, many members of the
community might prefer those terms,
because they maintain the visibility
of the idea of homosexuality."Wc all
welcome thenamechangebutitwill
requireanongoingcducaliononwhat
Stonewall is," Hank added.
According to Hank, the name of

the l-l/GRC has been controversial ,
since its inception during the fall of
1986. The center occupies a space ’
that used to house the campus inﬁr- .
mary,and when thefactlity ceased to
be of use during the 198586 aca- ’
dcmic year, various campus groups 4
vied for the space. Members of the .
campus homosexual community exV
pressed a need for a designated area ‘
similar to the BCC, and the space was ‘
granted tothem atthccnd oftheyear.
However, many lesbigays disliked‘
the administration’s deeming of the .
Center “Human/Gay"; consequently,
the lesbigay community has tosscd‘
aroundsevcralideas fornamechangcs .
over the years, and the Gay/Lesbian/
Bi Task Force decided on “Stone '
wall" last year. A
l-laaksaid that therenarning ofthe .
centerstgnals Ihebeginningofamorc
productive and effective era for the '
lesbigay community. “We have a .
name we can be proud of. The stu-
dents at Grinnell have been fighting '
for this for seven years now. We .
deserve a celebration,’ she said.
