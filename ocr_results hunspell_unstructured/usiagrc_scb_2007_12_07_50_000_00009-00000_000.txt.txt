career field.Ou the second day, I decided
against law school. But I still enjoyed assisting
the attorneys who struggled for rights of the
disabled and domestically abused.

And I see more examples of programs to
promote social justlcc. This Monday, 1 was
cynically reading the web
site's lead story, “College
sets plans to reduce student Th]; mange wag
debt." Naturally, l geared
up to complain. “Don’t they
always say that?“ I sard to

their three schooltfree months to serving oth-
ers, rather than merely fighting to keep their
bank accounts in the black.

The change was not because of student

importantly, a way in which students and the

Look between the covers for under-the-covers advice

in my high school, it was the norm to lose ones virginity
during junior or senior year, the conscqucncc or too many years
or hairshearted hand jobs. Unrorrunately, no one really knew

how to do it.

Enough dry humping could give anyone the general idea.

But that is only one aspect otthe action.
Multiple conversations over the years
revealed to me that all my classmates
had drirerent problems one girl and
her- boyfriend did not understand how
things were supposed to fit. Anothci

according to her doctor. (Word to the
wise: nrne trmes a day for two weeks is

not healthy) And then there were the unfortunate ones who
could not achieve orgasm, via intercourse or otherwise,

to navigate the territory of drunken condom application and

occasionally even sustain relationships.

It would have been nice to know about

scary world of intercourse It’s not too late,
though,

We can still confront our latent sexual
fcars (I'm not talking Freud here) even after

they have embedded themselves into our psyches.We can con-

trme we partake in sexual activity. And we can

gather sources, literary or otherwrse, and expand our minds. But
rrlrimately, we must conduct our own experiments on a feather

Splitting votes, not hairs: Hillary faces down the rest

If Edwards and Obama continue to split the anti-Hillary vote, look for the senator from New York to win the nomination

I’ll be the first to admit that I was wrongi
have consistently contended that Hillary Clint
ton was inevitably unstoppable: she had looked
up the Dcrnocratic nomination long before
any vote had ever been cast. in the debates,
she ran circles around her opponents, in the
money primary she was second to none; in the
endorsement primary, more bigsname Demo-
cratsjumped on board than on any other cams
pargn. But then came the month ofNovcmber,
and with it, planted questions and all, Clinton
has seen her poll numbers drop nationally Per
haps even more importantly, they dropped in
the critical early states of Iowa, New Hamp-
shire and South Carolina.

While the senator from New York struggles
into the wintry month of December, the Selim
tot from Illinois, Barack Oburna, is respont
sible for narrowing the gap. About two weeks
ago. the Obama campaign triumphantly pros
claimed that he was, for the first time, ahead
of Sen. Clinton in IowaThc Obama lead was

With her lead steadrly eroding, Clinton
is on the attack, She used to remain positive,
lambastrng her opponents for “taking one out
ofthe Republican playbook,"casting licrsclfas
the innocent victim of enemy rhetorical fire.
But now we have a new Clinton, a Clinton

laughable it may be, When she recently ate

second stage, New Hampshire. We saw this in
2004, when John Kerry came from behind to
win lowa and, thanks in part to his posttlowa
momentum, shocked Howard Dean a week
later in New Hampshire.

But take hecd, my Democratic friends,
entlrnsrastrc Obama supporters and fuming
Clintonthittcrs. Not so fast. While I agree
that Obama’s recent charge deﬁnitely made
this race more exciting, let us not suffer un-
der the delusion that "exciting" is the same as
“unpredictable.” Clinton is still in a very strong

position. She benefits from the fact that Ed
wards and Obama are both staying in the race,
thereby hurting each other (and themselves).
Both candidates appeal to a similar base: the
anti-war, change—we-cnn-belleve-in, no-more-
Washington-pol.itics-as-usunl, anti—Hillary
Democrats.

so the movements potential weakens
as it fractures into presObama and protEdt
wards camps. And
defeating Clinton
will take a united
front. The same
thing happened
in 1968 when the
aiititVietniim War
Democrats were
attempting to up-
stage and destroy ever-unpopular Lyndon
Johnson. The movements potential was there
and the Johnson administration was concerned.
But Bobby Kennedy and Gene McCarthy both
ran as doves in the election, wooing the liberal,
peacctdcsiring, anriejohnson vote,

Dcspitc the differences between 1968 and
in 2008, the same political rule applies. When
attempting to defeat a mutual iival it is unwise
to split the movement capable of beating that
rival between likctminded candidates,

Just think, Sen, Obarna is currently {out

percentage points ahead of Clinton in lowa.
Imagine how big his lead might be if Edwards
were not in the race, or alternatively, how well
Edwards might be doing if Obama was not a
factor. In the end, two guys on the same stage,
ﬁghting for the same crowd’s attention and
singing the same tune (in slightly different
keys) does not work terribly well.

so, what should happen?

It is naive to believe that either Obama
or Edwards would ever bow out for the other
(say, exiting the presidential nomination race
for a promise of the vice presidency). A “deal"
is unlikely, Obania could wait for Edwards to

t after a probable and embarrassing defeat
in his backyard, South Carolina. But this strat-
egy cuts it too close to super Tuesday, during
which a majorrty ofconvenuon delegates will
be selected. There would not be enough time
for the antitHillary movement to regroup and
mute en masse,

Maybe Obama and Edwards will hope for
the froritrurincr' to sclftdestmct—n poor, not
to mention reckless, campaign strategy. But as
Obnma and Edwards continue to battle for thc

' same constituency, Clinton’s political death is

delayed. If the antierllary Democrats fail to
unite soon, Clinton wrll be the nominee, even
though a hidden maiority of Democrats may
wish otherwise.
