Rethinking the college’s policy on rape

To siarr, I’d like ro apologise io all my inirhriil readers for
ihe deierioraring qualiry ofrhis eolurrin as orlare, I have been
recovering from a nasiy bour oiihe elap. Bur rhar is all eleared
up new and i promise you only rhe ﬁnesi from here on in.
Now seeing as ir isTake Baek ihe Nighr l rhink ii is appropriaie
ihar rhis eoliirnn address ihe issue ofmpc. Rape is m extremely
serious issue and ii should be ireaied as such.

speeirieally, I believe ihai ihe eollege's polieies on iape are
in error and need in be revised. Firsi on, i ehallenge ihe
norion ihai you eannor give eonseni under rhe inilu.
enee ofnlcohol. This is ihe same reasoning that holds
ihar you are nor responsible for My oiyour aerions
when you are under rhe inﬂuenee, and we all know
ihai rhere is no exeuse, “Your honor, I was drinking
when 1 ran over rhose people. " we are held
aeeounrable for our aerions and ihe de.
eisions we make, even when we niake
ihose deeisions airer deeiding ro imbibe
subsrnnees ihar will subsianiially alrer our
iudgerrienr.

l wani io focus on whai rhe eollege’s sea-ire; Mvseondiiee
pony says abour (Knonrforclble rape.” Ar Grinnell “non.rore.
ible rape" is (mated as eoereed nonvconxensual sexual inrereourse.
This is rape beeause rape is being defined as any sexual inrer.
eourse wirhour “erreeiwe consent," Eireerive eonseni is sober,
informed. willful. rnuiiially undersrandable. frccly given words

eollege adniiis, ihe key word is eonsenr. college poliey ”rccog»

gwe eonsenr." The logie orrliis reeogniiion is ihai ileohol and
drugs iinpairyourabiiiry io ihirikarid rnake sound jiidgeinenrs.
However, when drinking is rhe ehoiee you make, you rake on
rhe risks ihai eorne wiih ii, You are srill responsible For your
aerions and deeisions, however mueh impaired ihey may be,
when under rhe lnﬂucnce. And here is where we begin to run
inio ihe cnlx orour iinbioglio.

Who can forgei ihose helpful, and for some arousing, signs
pur up in rhe baihroorn sialls, deseribing various poreniial rape
siruarions. Here is one rhai we didn'r see: Frank and Marina
have boih been drinking or Harris. Arier freaking eaeh orher

and Marihn borh sellingeaeh orher ihey wani so have sex They
have sex. one week later Marsha believes Frank nonrforcibly
raped her. Marrha ﬁles a gi-ievanee. Did Frank rape Martha?

According ro an inierpreraiion ofcollegc policy he did. in
realiry we all know ihai rhis was
nor rape and is insuliingro so.

ihe deﬁnition of rape io

Borh pariies were under
