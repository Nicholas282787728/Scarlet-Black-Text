This fall the Y. w. C. A. rooms
have been completely redecorated
and reupholstcred to make an at-
tractive social center for the beneﬁt
of Y. W. members and their friends.
The Y. W. entertains at teas for col-
lege women during exams and is
also carspousor with the Y. M. of
the general reception. The social
program of the association has been
greatly extended this year.

The new vocational guidance de-
partment will require considerable
ﬁnancial support for its success. It
is planned if possible to bring several
outside speakers on vocational gui-
dance to the campus for the bcnefit
of all college women interested in
this field.

Freshmen Adopt Campus English

“Who are you dating tonight?"

"Say, she can dance like nobody‘s
business,”

“Oh, yeah?"

“de, he sure got hot and bother:
ed.”

“Don't be a krud.”

Typical among Grinnell students

'are these words and phrases of cam-

pus English, Yeti thbse attending
this institution in the hopes of ac
quiring enough hours to graduate are
not the only once who employ such
a vocabulary. While some of the
“Grinnecholned” colloquiaisms are
not used on other college arid univer
sity campuses of the United states, a
large majority of them can be found
in collegiate language . throughout
the nation.

Typical College Giammar

High school graduates who leave
home to attend college discover dur—
ing and especially after their period
of so»called freshman days, that
there is a college grammar spoken
by upper-class students, a laoge
uage which is similar to English,
and yet not the class that was
taught to them in the primers, spell-
ers and English books of their grade
school course.

In time the newcomer to the cam-
pus also acquires this collegiate vo-
cabulary. He has a roster of a score
of words and synonyms for dormi—
tory use, another to employ in writ
ing to the home folks, one to speak
when in the classroom and still an—
other to use in writing compositions
and journalistic articles.

Slang of New Generation.

it is in letters to mother and dad
at home that some young high school
graduates, aspiring to assume the air
of an old student in both speech and
ways, beam forth with an array of
words lhat usually is baffling to his
parents, bred in another generation
of college slang.

 

Among First of Grinnell Customs

Dad issues a check for first semes-
ter.expenses, and then casually re~
marks in an accompanying note for
you to inform him what he has paid
for. A hasty letter of campus Eng-
lish explanation reaches home, and
the puzzle is as great as ever—$7.50
for house dues, $7.50 for send fee,
52.50 linen fee, etc.

The “all wet" and "all hot and
bothered" common sayings are often
spoken in the course of a class-
room recitstion. An explana:
tion of a point in psychology
or English is given in terms of cam-
pus English and campus examples.
You can't dodge the language!
Whether rit's forei or ancient
grammar, a campus slang word or
phrase is most suitable for express
ing the recitation.

Language Absorbs Siam;

This inevitable 1929 English
creeps into our strictly formal Eng-
lish themes and essays. Were stu-
dents ‘of twenty years ago
to use the expression, “give
him the gate," no doubt to confer-
ence and warning not to use it again
would be the order of the professor.
Today, while such words are by all
means not always approved in writ-
ten work, they are often accepted,

Journalistic activities provide for
use of a large number of campus
English words, The ”picket fences,”
"B. of 1LT." and "Sampler” are
terms mentioned and read Without
thought of derivation in our local
newspapers, 'Sports are brought to
the athletic enthusiast In formidable
expressions, yet grammar that op-
peals for interesting reading.

Campus English occupies the cone
versation of thousands of young
people nine months of every twelve
for four, five and six years; then
the co-ed and collegian drift back to
the outside world-s language, to start
learning the English language all
over again.
