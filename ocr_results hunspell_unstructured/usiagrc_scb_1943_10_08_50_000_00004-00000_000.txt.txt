Such “chow-hounds’ as BillKet-
cham, Gene Rovcgno, Ed lash,
Wes Hamilton, and “Tiny" aeraud
will fight ten times harder for
food than for fame or money. So
Read is eating first this week at
a result of Sunday’s football game.

Main at 7 o'clock this evening."
Duke Decamillo: “See, who is

Dick: “How do I know who's
going to be a 6th. and Main at

A Soldier's Philosophical Glean-
ings. . .There are so many women
in the army, that when a soldier
sees someone in uniform coming
down the street, he has to wait
until he’s 20 ft. away before he
knows whether to salute or whis—
the.

you put him to sleep." (With due
apologies to Prof. Gale.)

In the first quarter sloppy
blocking forced a puntiiig duel,
with the college getting the ”an
ial advantage. A long Hermosillo
punt set the army back on their
own ten yard line. Failing to come
plete two passes, the army punted
in turn, down to the college thirty.
Here the deciding break of the
game occurcd A college fumblc
gave the possession of thc ball to
the Read outfit on the college
twenty yard line. A pass took the
army down to the ten. Stopped
for a moment by a beautiful in»
torception by Crandall. the army

the first Read team, grabbed a
college pass and sprinted thirty
yards for the deciding six points
of the game. Shortly afterwards
[the half ended, leaving the army
on top.

Receiving the kickoff, Hermoe
sillo tWisted and turned from his
own end zone to the college thirty.
A lateral pass with Powell Cal"
ryiiig gained ten more, and tiie
collegc began to move. Another
lateral play gave the little Mexi-
can a chance to show his stuff.
Shades-ofrTOlneI-Ial'mon, Hermosil-

tire army team before he was fine
ally snagged on the aiiny twenty-

Primed for a touchdown, the
college team tried too hard and
a long aerial was snagged by the
army on their own twenty, The
army marched to the midstripe,
but was unable to make any head
way, losing the ball on downs. The
Macy Men took over With a beau-
tiful pass from Doc Eiel to Cran-
dall on the army thirty. An end
run carried to the army fifteen
yard line. Again Doc Eiel ran to
the next white line for a first
down. Here the whistle ended the
spirited college drive and gave
the first Read team a 6-0 victory.

Credit goes especially to Cran-
dall. Powell, and Doc Eiel to the
college for their brilliant intercep-
tions and all around play. And on
the army side, Olmstead displayed
a brilliant brand of football.
