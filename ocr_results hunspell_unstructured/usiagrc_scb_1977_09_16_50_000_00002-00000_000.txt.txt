By Trena Cleland

Edward Mezvinsky, former Iowa
congressman and currently the
United States’ representative to
the United Nations Human Rights
Commission, spoke at Grinneil last
week on the Carter ad-
ministration's human rights and
foreign policy commitments.

Mezvinsky, who earned his role
as Andrew Young‘s chief deputy
through a Presidential ap-
pointment, was sworn in on July 15,
Since then, he has had to deal with
and oversee what he described as a
“tough road” to human rights
goals Set by President Carter,
Secretary of State Vance and
Young.

AT BOTH an informal afternoon
session and an evening lecture
entitled “Picking Up the Pieces
After Vietnam and Watergate,”
Mezvinsky outlined several
aspects of the human rights issue:
the necessity of “consistency” in
demanding human righs among
nations, the importance of
adequate human rights within the
U.S., the participation of the U.N.
in the debate, and Carter's
credlbility on this and other issues
in the post-Vietnam and Watergate
era.

In a question and answer session
after the lecture, Mezvinsky said
that he felt Nixon should not have
been pardoned, and that he hopes
Bert Lance, Director of the Office
of Management and Budget, will
“do the right thing,“ strongly
implying that Lance should resign.

Mezvinsky opened the evening
lecture commenting on the
uniqueness of the government’s
human rights concern and stressed
that much weight has been placed
on human rights by the ad-
minisuation.

“HUMAN rights as far as a term
and a standard have been around
for a long time. . .what I think is
new is where we‘re going to go on
our foreign policy. Do we continue
aid programs? Do we conduct our
foreign policy on the basis of the
way a country responds to human
rights? Before (Carter took a
stand) you wouldn't even have any
discussion of human rights Now
we have to factor in the human
rights quotient,” he Said.

Mezvmsky did imply that the
US. would cut off arms or
economic aid to countries that do
not alter intolerable conditions. He
said that the first step in a review
of a country’s policies is to see
exactly what is being done to alter
conditions, and then to let the
nation know that the U.S. is con-
cerned.

”We assess how they’re doing. .
then there’s a decision made as to
whether we continue aid," he said.
“It is a struggle; it’s not something
that happens overnight. I think we
have moved in those areas, and we
have, in fact, cut off aid.”

Mezvinsky emphasized the need

to consider the policies of many
different countries, not just those
of a select few. The assessment
process includes sending teams of
investigators abroad to evaluate
governmental procedures in

very serious. We can’t treat them
any differently than we treat any
other country," he said. ,

Key elements affecting the issue,
Mezvinsky said, are several
charters and treaties which have
received universal review. Among
these are the Universal

MEZVINSKY also talked about
his years in the House of
Represenuatives and the period in
which exrresident Nixon fought
with Congress on the Vietnam war
and Watergate,

“We got into Congress in 1973. In
some ways, because we didn‘t
know any better, we tried some
things. The House wasn’t very
good in terms of the war in Viet
nam. . ,the House was weak. And
we said, 'Look! We can’t have it
any more. We think we’re entitled
to a voter Let’s move on the war,
let’s cut off the funding.’ In May,
1973, we finally got a vote, and we
cutoff the funding. Richard Nixon
and Congress were on a collision
course, It was not easy to go
through that period, because no
one likes to say that his president,
of whatever political belief, has
demaaned the office to such an
extent that he should be removed,"

Declaration of Human Rights,
which “basically says that no one
should be tortured or imprisoned
by the arbitrary act of a public
officialr" and the U.N. Genocide
Treaty, which stipulates that no
government can be involved in the
genocide of its own citizens, Over
or) countries have signed and
ratified the latter document; the
U.S. has signed but not ratified it.
A two-thirds vote in the Senate,
which the administration seems
unable to muster, is needed for
ratification.

“IT'S OUR hope that the smnr
dards and the treaties will be
followed. In the long run, no
country wants to say, ‘lt’s okay for
us to have torture, for us to have
genocide.‘ I could not live with
being the policeman of the world if
it involved arms,

“The U.N. was set up to bring
some kind of peace and stability to
the world. It’s a mechanism that
acts as a restraint. And the U.N. is
on trial. . .to see how it responds. If
it fails, it’s not that the institution

The Pig Pen

he said

MEZVINSKY said that Carter
has “raised the Standards" of the
office, and praised what he sees as
a regenerative mood among
Americans. Carter’s abandonment
of some of the excesses past adr
ministrations were described as an
attempt to restore the feeling that
Carter is no longer “the imperial
President.”

“It’s the image, it's the per
ception, Some people call it image-
building It is. No question about it.
It's needed to develop a little more
faith and credibility when you have
to face the substantive issues.
We‘re seeing new trends, and
we're also seeing a reevaluation
process take place, both in-
dividually and institutionally. This
country’s stronger for all of the
agony (of Vietnam and
Watergate); I’m confident that
there’s a resiliency in this country
. . .that can Show itself as we have
to put ourselves together and think
through where we‘re going."
