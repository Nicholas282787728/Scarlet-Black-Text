The event involved thirtyrﬁvc
people in Main Lounge at 7:30 last
Monday night. The path that led to
the event was as convoluted as paths
come,
Three weeks Czlr-
licr, thc son’s Joint
Board (which consists
oFthe Senators elected
at the start ofcacll sc-
mester) had approved
funding for Grinncll
socialists to bring
David McReynolds, a
longtime antiwar dame
nnstrator and current
socialist Patty candidate
for President, to speak on
the topic ofzoth century
pacifism.
In die interim, how»
a pairofbylawsi‘nmtnd-
ments" to (h: SGA Constitution—
had con-re to the attention of the of-
ﬁcers on the Cabinet (sct sidebar)
Because the budget had been ap»
proved by Joint Board ltraditionally
the interpreter oi bylaw violations),
the ﬁrst clausc did not apply to what

ever,

had bccn inrcrprctcd as a non-Cam-
pnignrrelated presentation. in the int

terpratanon orsomc mcmbcrs ofilic.

Cabinet, however, the activity was
unconstitutional, and rho sccond by-
law was interpreted by the cabinet to
include unconstitutional activities in
the deﬁnition or “unsatisractory
records." Emilie Beavers, the Trea-
surcr, therefore withdrew SGA fundr
ing from the presentation.

Grinnell socialists, whose advcr»
tisemenls for the talk had included a
description orMcReynolds as the So»
cialist Presidential candidate, were ins
srructcd to takc down all the such
posters in order to regain funding.
The organization (which has no
standing budget) complied though
scvcral outdated email notiﬁcations
had already been forwarded to vatir
ous campus groups.

“we wcr: ready to fund at that
point, on Friday," said beavers, refer—
ring to the 18-) ofFebruary, “on Sun»
day it was brought up at the [Cabi-
nct] meeting that it might be against
federal law." As a nonprofit organiza-
tion, it was discovered, the college
might be judgizd in violation ofa law
prohibiting support ofpoliticnl cam-

paigns. in thc cud, “lack of funding
was a result orcollcge policy," at.
plaincd Vivek Vcnugopal, son Presir
dent, “We went to the legal advisor
and asked ifwe could in fact fund lhc
speaker, and he said it was against
collcg: policy." McRcynolds was then
norihcd that he would not receive the
promiscd funds for the nest days pro.
sontation. The retired journalist and
activist resolved to come anyway, say-
ing during his speech rhat "there’s an
issue involved here: not my right to
speak, your right to hear... money is
not the issue,"

Evcn before thc discovery of the
federal law, the week‘s activities
prompted a number or questions
about bylaw interpretation. A numr
bet ofsrudents, many ofthem men-l-
bets of Grinnell Socialists, expressed
concern ovcr the events. “I think the
problem is twofold," said Elizabedl
Fry ’01, “one is a problem with unr
clear writing of the bylaws. A second
problem is cabinet and rheir incon»
slstency and untimcliness. It seems to
me that the law [Cabinet] ﬁnally
found after looking for a really long
