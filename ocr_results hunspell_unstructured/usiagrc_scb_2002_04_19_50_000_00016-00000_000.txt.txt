What’s it take to get a good call?

Barred from playing in 51 for obvious reasons,
Grinnell basketball players took on the role of
their in-seasnn tormentnrs, the referees. here's
the inside scoop on how to get on their good
side from Cole Robertson '05 and Eric Walsh ‘05.
~ Do have a good time and keepthe game loose.
“I like how everyone's just out there having fun,
not taking it too seriously,“ Walsh said. "It gives

you a new perspettive on the game. Not .

everyone’s )ust mntentrated on winning."

- no be original. ”I like thetearns thatave out
there to have furl," Robertson said, "There's one
team that, all game, starts counting down from
ﬁve, and they'll shoot hali-enurters all game,

That team’s kinda entertaining to watch,”

- DONT gripe over calls; you won't get them.
"That bothers me some," Rnbertsnn said, “cause
its all for run. Everybody/s out there to have
fun. We're out there having fun as rers, too, so
if we miss a few things, you gotta let it go." Tn
short, you can rorget about being nailed tor a
hand chetk or rorthree seconds in the lane.

- no remember; the Pioneer men’s team sur-
tened through a game this year where orrieials
whistled so fouls, and they learned their les-
son. ”We don't want to decide the games for
them. We want the teams to decide the game,"
Walsh said.
