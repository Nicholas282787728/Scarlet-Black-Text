AN HONOR, A TASK AND A PBIVILEGE

 

:clude withdrawal from the League

 

Announcement today of the selection of eight senior
men as charter members of the new senior men’s honor,
society comes as welcome proof that such an organization,"
long needed, has come into existence, _ l

To these men we address our congratulations and this}
editorial. You have been awarded this recognition, not only}
because of your undoubted leadership, but also for the in-

fluence your deeds have exerted on the -grou'th of this;

college.

You know that there has been some opposition to the
formation of this honor group on the part of those \vhol'eel
that there are already too many activities and organizations
They claim, and rightly, that some of these groups serve no'
useful pulpose, and they point out that this honor society
will be, since you are all campus leaders and members of
numerous organizations, A duplication.

Your task, then, is to keep this honor awarded you from
being an empty thing by promoting and recognizing,r acti-
vities which will aid in the building of a better Grinnell.
Such a task is a privilege and the real honor to you is that
you have been permitted to undertake it.

It is not our place to tell you uliat to do to accomplish
that result. You have been chosen to membership for your
ability to make such decisions for yourselves. We are coll-
fident that you will succeed in this, our common aim.

FlNGERPRlNTlNG-TORﬁOTECTION

Public approval of civil identification by means of l' in
gerprinting has t‘ lien on impetus in this country ill recent
years. This feeling my be accounted for when we realize
that only recently has the public been shown that linger
printing is not only a means of identification of criminals
but is also a protection to the private individual.

At the present time there are on file in the office of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation more than o00.000
prints of private individuals, These prints have been filed,
at no personal expense, for citizens who realize the value of
having a positive means of identification available at a cen—
tral place.

Among the more potent advantages would be the elimi-
nation of loss sustained by the cashing of bad checks.
Losses by fraudulent transfer of property would be cur-
tailed, unknown dead could be identified, amnesia and drug
victims could be located, and vic 'ms of accidents could be
better identified.

THANKS!

Praise those from whom these blessings flow, for today
we have seen the realization of one point in our program
for Grinnell.

’Tis a small point indeed and one which may seem inc
significant, but from little acorns are mighty oak trees
grown, and at long last We have seen all doors to the Alumni
Recitation Hall unlocked.

So, with the utmost sincerity, may we express our

 

gratitude to those officials responsible for this welcome
step. Whatever you may have thought of us for our harp-
ing on such a small issue, we are grateful for your accep-
tance of our suggestion.

VIENhr, . STRIl\.—ani in-
fluence In Austrla reached a new
height this week. Five Nozii
sylnpatluzers took their places in
the Austlian cabinet. Key man
of the new cabinet, formed last
weekend by Chancellor Kurt
Schuschuigg of Austria and
Hitlor of Germany, is Minister
of the Interior, Arthur Seysz-
anuart, who Friday was occupied
in drawing up a new program for
Austria which 15 reported to in—

Germany and Japan in the anti»

Birt- nl' these moves, and milk-
ing possible Germany's influence,
is the fact that there is in Aus-
tlia a strong Nazi party as well
as n traditional ideal of Austrian
union, dating back to thc period
of the Gellnanles and the lcvolu-
Lions at 1830 and 1848

From u lliplomntic standpoint
lhc whole sequence of events
seems to have been planned by
HlLlcr as a mask to distract ab
tention from the changes made
last week in the social, political
and military life of Germany

As to the results, it is too curly
to judge. It is obvious that the
move not only Surprised, but
worried France and England.
Only last vvcek British received
assurances from rtaly that she
would insist an independent Aus-
his and now apparently Italy
has concurred in the present ac-
tion Austria is still nominally
independent, but it is obvious that
the new cabinet will be influenced
by Germany.

“Hitler, Mussolini willing to pay for the tests,

International
Anarchists”

“The great international anar—
chists of today, with a craving
for power unbounded," was cha‘
actcrization of Hitler and Musso-
hui given Thursday night by Dr.
Walter Kotschnig, in his first lec-
ture of a series of eight on inter-
national relations.

Dl'. Kotschnig talked Thursday
on “National Character and Poliv
tical Myth," His next lecture, to
be given Tuesday at 7:30 p. m. In
Herrick chapel is entitled ”The
Two Souls of Germany.”

Dr. Kotschnig asserted that the
essentials in the promotion of
better international relations are
a knowledge of the factors that
go to make up a nation's char-
acter—including race, geographic
position, common territory, com-
position of population, common
language, religion and common
historical associationsizn under—
standing of how thcsc traits are
fused into n national character;
and a realization of the im-
portance of the national myth,
which may change from genera-
tion to generation.

“our present knowledge of
other nations is superficiaguthc
speaker said. “We must dig
deeper to an understanding. When
understanding of nations is reach-
ed, then we can handle them. We
will then achieve an order which
treaties have not achieved—an
order grateful to o harrasseu
world,”
