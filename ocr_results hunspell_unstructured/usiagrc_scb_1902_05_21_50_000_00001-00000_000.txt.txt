VICTORY AND DEFEAT.

Grinnell wins One League Game From
Amos and Loses the Other to
Iowa.

On Saturday Grinnell took
Ames into camp at Ames in a
game of baseball by the score of
13 to 2. It was the ﬁrst league
game of the season and the result
ot the game raised high the hopes
ot the local fans. The game
played was giltredged, Every
man played his position well and
every man crossed the home plate
at least once Ames had an ime
mense crowd out to support her
team and the support was as loyal
when defeat stared them in the
face as it had been when there was
hope of victory. The treatment
accorded the visitors was superb.
Ames' manager in particular doing
allin his power to make the stay
a pleasant one.

on Tuesday the tale changed.
Grinnell wished to attract a little
attention to herself, so. taking
pointers from stricken St Vincent.
she gracefully accepted a rain of
ﬂies, liners and grounders, such as
the sunny Antilles never dreamed
of, To express it in the terms oi
an on-looker, when Iowa was at
the bat nine men stood around in
the ﬁeld, Clark pitched the ﬁrst
four innings. Iowa was not play-
ing championship ball, and had
Grinnell played the ball she at
times puts up. the score would be
different. The raw decisions of
the umpire may have had some in-
ﬂuence. but do not account for the
loss of the game, It has never
been explained what the hoodoo
is that lowakeeps for Grinnell. but
certain it is that something of that
nature exists.

The league game with Cornell
yet remains to be played This

will be an opportunity for the stu~
dents to rally to the support of
the team. Grinnell has for years
desired a nine that could play con~
sistent ball, but such an organiza
tion has not yet revealed itselfl

THE ACADEMY WINS.

The Lewis-Alhens Debate Won by lhe
Former Society—Some Good
Debating Done.

Saturday evening iorthe second
time the Academy society met
the Penn Academy in joint de-
bate and for the second time,
likewise, the decision went to
Grinnell. Grinnell’s second vic-
tory over her opponent may be
ascribed to the same cause as the
ﬁrst one. More thorough pre-
paration and a better grasp of the
subject tells the story.

The Penn debaters were ace
companied by a crowd of twenty
ﬁve boys and girls who proved to
be most enthusiastic rooters. The
best kind of spirit prevailed
throughout the contest. The
chapel was decorated in scarlet
and black. relieved by the blue
andthegoldofPenmandduringthe
intermissions in the debate the
mom resounded with the songs
and yells of the rooters.

The question discussed was in
regard to the desirability of ex-
cluding the Chinese from this
country. Grinnell aﬁirmed this
proposition and Penn upheld the
negative. Tilton opened the de-
bate for Grinnell, He showed
that the only alternative to ex~
clusion was the open door policy.
and proved by statistics that this
would result in ﬂooding the coun-
try with Chinese coolie labor.

Mcllrath devoted his time to a
description of tho vices of the
Chinese and the degrading effect
produced on Americans by con-
tact with them, Raley took up
the indllstrial phase of the ques~
tionl He clearly depicted the
evils which befall American labor
and the American workingman
when forced to compete with the
cheap labor ofthe Chinese coolies.

The Penn debaters were Messrs.
Ryan. Dille, and Knight. Their
main arguments were that under
the exclusion policy our trade
with China is insigniﬁcant, that
the Chinese immigrant is no more
of a menace to America than
those of many other countries and
therefore to exclude him is both
unjust and illogical. and that he
devotes himself to lines of work
which do not bring him into
competition with American labor.

The teams scented about equal~

ly good in delivery. Grinnell's
superiority lay in her more thor-
ough grasp of the subject and in
sticking better to arguments that
were pertinent to the question.
This dirtcrence in preparation was
especially marked in the rebuttals,
given by Mcllrath and Ryan.
After the debate the audience
adjourned to Institute Hall where
an informal reception was held
and a chance given the students
and visitors to become acquainted.
Professor O'Connor now gained
the attention and announced that
all present were invited to pro-
ceed to the rooms of the “Met."
This was asurprise planned by
the academy faculty, and though
the last. was by no means the least
enjoyable teature, of the evening.
Speeches were made by members
of the teams. faculty and judges,
and the regulation jolllﬁcation
held. The treatment accorded the
visitors throughout the evening
went far towards effacing the sting
of defeat from'their minds. May
the pleasant relations existing be
between the two societies long

continue.

STATE MEET.

Outlook tor the Dinerent Schools Next
Friday.—Drake the Favorite
and Should Win.

Never since the days of certain
victories for Grinnell has the out
come of state meet been in such
little doubt as is that of the 1902
meet, The startling result of the
triangular two weeks back is evir
dence enoughonthispoint. Drake
cannot win on Friday so easily as
she did at Amos however. Some
of the races she won then were
won only by such small margins
that she can have no assurance of
winning them again. The [20
yard hurdle. the ddoyard dash and
the mile run were won by Drake
inthetriangillar but in no way
can they be said to be sure ﬁrsts
for Drake at the state meet. But
without these points ourChristian
brethren of the blue and white
will not lack anything of a clear
plurality. 0n the other hand
Grinnell and Ames. the only
other schools that will ﬁgure con-
spicuously in Friday's games. as
we see things, will have nothing
to lose and everything to gain by
