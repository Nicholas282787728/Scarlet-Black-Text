The meet was started promptly at one

more than two hours the order given

of events which Was followed.

As had been anticipated Griuneli’s
stars turned out to be Glow, Huff, Mc-
Keane and Mollrath, tne ﬁrst named
distinguishing himseli and Iowa Col-
lege by taking iour ﬁrst places. Mce
Kean's showing was in all respects
satisfactory. His work with the
weights was uniformly good though
the discus performance of 12‘) feet
stands out as his best. In Anderson,
the winner of the shot put, Missouri
has a splendid athlete as the record of
42ft. 3in., made last Saturday will
Show. Hull and DicIlrath won their
events without dlﬂiculty. The records
were all made on a slow, cinder track
and in the face of a hard Wind.

The last few moments of the meet
were full of excitement. It was in
the nature of things that the ﬁeld
events should outlast those on the
track though the two varieties were
carried on simultaneously. The meet
was nearly over and the score read.
Missouri 49, Grinnell 39, the wide lead
having been gained by aciean sweep
for Missouri in the high jump. This
was the ﬁrst and last occasion on
which the gap was large. But other

Even While the rooters were yelling
like mad over the comfortable lead,
McKeane was busy taking ﬁve points
out of the Discus and the score was
revised to this elrcct; Missouri 2,

MR. FRAMPTON’S RECITAL,

On Tuesday evening, April 25, Mr.
Frampton gave his second organ
recital in the College Chapel. His
programme was:
Gliilmullt, Sonata VII, F
Bird, Two Oriental Sketches
Andrews, Procorional March

It was a rather unusual programme
in that all the numbers on it were
composed within ihe last three years.
Mr. Frampton gave a most musicianly
and enjoyable interpretation to the
entire programme. The Guilmnnn
Sonaia, as Mr. Frampton explained is
more in the nature or a Suite than or
aScnata. Itis less uniﬁed than the
Filth Sonata, though hardly less
interesting. The “Dreams: and the
Cantabile were very expressive, and
the Finale strong.

Both the Oriental Sketches were
exceedingly interesting. The last
appealed to the sense or humor of the
audience, being a (leligntlul Scherzo
in March iorin.

Mr. Andrews' Processional March is
hardly up to his Sonata. Tile Ma -li
movement lac k s in inspiration,
though the trio in A flat is very beau-
tiful, and the accompanying ﬁgure
\vell handled.

Grinnell will enjoy Mr. mepton‘s
work even more next year, when the
new church organ will give free scope
to his powers. ‘

The Oratorio Society will sing The
Swan and Skylark by Goring Thomas
on Monday evening of commencement
week.

An Examination Willbeheld
in School of Music Hall, Friday even-
ing at seven o‘clock of this week. The
ﬁrst rehearsal will be in college chapel
Monday evening at 1:00.

The entire music for Sunday and
Monday oi commencement will be
announced within a week,

In the afternoon both teams showed
the stream Ofthe morning game by
listless and careless playing. Smith-

hits. Barber took his place and ﬁn-

delayed by the high school ﬁeld meet.
