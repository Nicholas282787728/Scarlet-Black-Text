Gates lecturer Discusses Islam

Editors note: The iollowing story
on the Gates lectures given Sunday
and Monday, Oct. l4 and 15 inner.
rick Chapel was written by son
reporters Tishs Bauer and Louise
Dix,

Isma'il a. at Faruqi presented
his iirst speech oi the 1973 Gates

Lectureseries on “The Essence
of Religious Experience in Islam,"

A native of Palestine, he is a
professor of islamic at Temple
University.

a1 Faruqi explained that the es
sence of the Islamic religion is tia-
sed on the belief that ”there is no
God but God." The Islamic God is
a unique God who reigns supreme
above natural laws.

“God alone is creator-his will
alone is commander,"

“All men are equally near to
God” a1 Faruqi pointed out, but
all are also free to decide whe-
ther or not to follow the divine
Word. ln order to become “an in-
strument of God's will” the indiv-
idual must initiate his own comr
mitment to God. Man conducts his
search for truth, beauty. and know
ledge utilizing his intuition and tear
soning powers.

“Knowledge oi divine will is pos-
sible by reason” the result being
"the realization that life is not in
vain.”

i-ie summed up the goal of the
individual Muslim as “to fulfill
divine imperative, hope for mercy
along the way, and make one’s own
destiny.”

These ideas were elaborated on in
the second lecture on “the Muslim
and the Faiths ufOtherMen."There
is a purpose to man’s existence,
according to al Faruqi and that
purpose is “the fulfillment of the
divine will.”

There are two realms; the naturr
al realm and the divine realm, wh—
ich is “the ought to be of the “a,
tural realm,” said the professor.
“Man stands under obligation issue
ing from the divine realm," he said.

“All men have received a revel-
ation from God,” 31 Faruqi stre»
ssed. “God does not deprive anyone
from the benefit of his revelation.

God sends a prophet to every single
person on earth.”

There are two avenues to ilnit
divine will; one, through revelac
tion and the other through human
reason and knowledge. “Both ave-
nues enable the Muslim to regard
all men as being born with the eqc
uip em (reason and revelation) si-
milar to his,” all Faruqi stated.

He remarked that the Muslim con-
sidets no religion the Work of the
devil; all are legitimate and all are

ccepted by such by the Muslim,

All men are regarded by the Muse
lim as men equipped by the creac
tor to know and estahlish God's
will on earth," he continued. “To
know and to do His will is the
birthright or every human being.”

at Faruqi also discussed what the

Islam Calls ”The Religion" or the
original religion. “All men are
born Muslims,” he said, "The cul-
ture and history are what Chris»
tianizes, Hinduizes or Judizes
them.” The Muslim’s job is to find
out how close or far the historical

religion is from the primordial.

then told the caller the APR.

ISPIRG contends that either of th-
ese responses is illegal, although
there is some question on this
point.

of unquestionable illegality, accorc
ding to the ISPIRG report, is fail—
ure to provide callers with the APR
while quoting either addron or dis-
count rates. Some 28 institutions
were following this practice,accor-
ding to the ISPIRG report.

Betsy, Seaman, Consumer Proieci
Director tor ISPIRG, noted, “The
(Truth-in-Lending) Act states that
only the annual percentage rate can
be quoted, and 164 of the banks and
loan companies surveyed are com-
plying with the law,"

IN GRINNELL, four institutions
were surveyed. 0i these. nvco
Financial Services, 817-4th Ave-
nue, was charged in the report
with providing add-on and discount
interest figures first, and then the
APR, when telephoned by Deirdre

The Koran commands the Muslim
to call all men to God. ”Every man
must listen ii he is to be regarded
as' sane.” He gave an example
where one man tells anuther that
his house is on fire. “II the man
who is told that his house is on
tire does not respond aifirmatlvely
and share in the quest (of finding
out the truth) then, that man must
be crazy." al Faruqi commanded.

“This business or religion is allow-
ing uneseli to be convinced and get-
ting convinced. Faith is not a de~
cision, put it is a conclusion. For
that conclusion to be reached, ellle
dence must be there,” he said.

“I see the whole world as a free
and open highway oi ideas and ier
anyone to build an iron curtain ar-
ound himself is ridiculous." He said
that others with different ideas
should be allowed to come and talk.
“Let each man decide for himself,
Conversion has no value if it ls not
free; no moral value if done under
moral constraint," concluded at
Faruqi.

Smith, a local ISPIRG member.
Another Iowa AVCO office, located
in Ames, was charged with not pro»
viding any interest information ex.
cept that computed using the
discount or addcon methods.

AVCO officials in the Grinnell Ofr
iice reiused comment, reierring
questions on the report to the AVCO
regional oiiice in Des Moines,

However, Regional Supervlsor Rec
ger Williams, to whom all inquiries
were reierred, was not available
for comment. His office said Tuesc
day that he was “out of town for
the afternoon," and he failed to re
turn the Call Wednesday

\Grinnell’s two banks, Foweshiek
County National and Grinnell State,

were both found to be in compliance '

with the law by the ISPIRG survey.

The only other lending institution
in Grinnell, Grinnell Federal Sav-
ings and Loan Association, does not
make loans for automobile pur-
chases, and so did not quote any
interest rates.

LN IOWA CITY, ISPIRG officials
announced the iiling ofa complaint
with the Iowa Commerce Commis-
sion alleging that the Duane Arnold
Energy Plant in Palo will not con—
stitute “reasonable” service under
lowa law.

The move is the latest in a long
series oi moves by ISPIRG against
the nuclear generating plant which
is now nearing completion.

Earlier in the week, ISPIRG had
announced that it will monitor cam-
palgn expenditures oi candidates
in lowa City municipal elections.
