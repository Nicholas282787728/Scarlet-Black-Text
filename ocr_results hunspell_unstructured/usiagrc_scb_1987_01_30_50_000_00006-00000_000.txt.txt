The Human Element

Yet Another
Lost

Opportunity

John H Mutti has jtut been announc-
ed as the new the Sidney Meyer Chair
in international economics. From
reading Mr. Mytli's extensive vitae, it
appear: that the college has done a fine
job of hiring a first-rate economics pro-
fessor. Yet, when one finds out that
there were only twenty applicants for
the Meyer chair and that among those
applicants there were no minority or
women candidates, can only
wonder as to how effectively the col-
lege’s afﬁrmative action program is
working.

The absolute lack of any minority or
female applicants for the Meyer Chair
is perhaps reﬂective of how aggressive
the college has been in simply obtain.
ing minority or female applicants for
any faculty positions. Granted, the col-
lege's geographic location presents real
difﬁculties in attracting minority facul-
ly members, but this should not be an
excuse for not actively seeking minority
or women applicants.

With a college facility that has only

one

one senior black member and only one
female at the full professor ranlt, the
Meyer Chair presented a perfect oppor-
tunity for the college to act in diversify-
ing the faculty. And unfortunately, the
college could not get even one black or
female applicant.

Some have argued that in the clue of
the Meyer Chair, the type of highly
tchohzrship-orienlcd candidate the col-
lege was looking diminished the
number of possible minority or female
applicants. In fact, this may indeed be
true, but then Grinnell College must
seriously consider whether it wants a
diverse faculty that teaches. Somehow,
it seem a diverse faculty that teaches

We take the turnoll to the canyon at
Ted’s Place. It’s a small roadside joint, a
greasy spoon owned and operated ever
since I can remember by a mousy guy with
a kind of nasal voice named Carl.

Dad drives. Neither one of us says much
going up the canyon. I look down the em»
hankment to” the swirling water of the
Cache La Poudre River below and think of
all the times the two oi us came up here
when I was a kid to ﬁsh or hike or live in
the cabin tor a tow days. It’s situated up
the mountain at ways across trom Cherry
Falls.

We park and begin hiking. The trail
winds upwards and to the northwest, not
too steeply, Clusters of pines line portions
ol the path. A brushchoked gulley runs
parallel {0 ll. Somewhere within the tangl»
ed undergrowth I can hear the brook gurgl»

one of a thousand other nameless trickles

somehow reassuring roar ot the river.

Dad's holding up, The all”s thinner up
here, and I can tell that his breathing is a
bit forced.

Igo a little tarther, past the rough-edged
boulder that threatens to roll over and
block the overgrown trail, and call a rest
halt, The balding spot an Dad's head
glistens with beads olsweat. I pass him the
water bottle from my backpack. ”How're

-All New-

you doin'? You still want me to lead?”

He gives me the 0k sign as he slugs down
a dual gulp. He spins the top back on, and
hands back the plastic bottle.

I strike out, breaking my own trail
toward the ridge. An hour later we stand
on the edge ol a mountain meadow which
the two of us “discovered” on a hike when
I was a kid.

Lunch. For me, peanut butter and jelly.
For dad, lruit. I think it strange, but
dismiss it. Later I find out. that he’s on a
strict fruit diet along with Mom. It seems
he's trying to lose the potbclly that's
developed since has stopped playing
basketball.

We start back. About hallway down the
mountain I’m \vadlng through some nasty-
thick brush and notice that Dad’s lagging

back a little. His lace Is strained. We take

another break.

The remainder of the hike is [requently
broken by ever-lengthening rest periods.
when we reach the car, Dad looks pretty
exhausted. He suggests that I drive. “Are
we stopping at Dairy Barn an the way
back?"

“We’ll see,” he answers. Dairy Barn in
