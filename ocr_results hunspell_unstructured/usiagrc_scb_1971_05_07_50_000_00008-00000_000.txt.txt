Baseball Team Puls Up

Grinnell's baseball team
blew hot and cold this past
week as the Pioneers looked
good in a doubleheader loss
to Cornell Thursday by scores
of 5-1 and 6-5 (sic). When
Saturday dawned, however, the
team reverted to type and got
clobbered 18-1. Last Monday,
the Pioneers lost to Simpson
11-1.

Against Cornell the Sackers
almost pulled out a victory as
they got hooked up in a score-
less duel for three innings;
a duel which saw Grinnellpull
off its first double play in,
according to Coach Ray Boyd,
three years. In the bottom of
the fourth, however, a momv
entary lapse let in three un-
earned runs, and Mike Levy
Was saddled with another un-
deserved loss. In the second
game, the Pioneers led 5-2
one out into the seventh (and
last) inning, but Levy, whohad
relieved smrter Wes Fujii in
the third inning, finally ran
out of gas. This, coupled with
another momentary relapse
by the defense, enabled Cor-
nell to edge across four runs
and eke out the second victory.
When Coe came to town Sat‘
urday, it seemed as though
Grinnell was determined'to
make up for the previous two
games as both pitching and
defense deserted the team.
Everybody in the Grinnell ins
ﬁeld got to pitch. Shortstop
Fujii was quickly victimized
by poor defense and Coe hit-

Council Approves
Credit Fail Change

The Executive Council has
approved a recommendation of
the Academic Standing Com‘
mittee that in future semesr
ters all students be allowed
to change grades to or from
credit fail until the last week
of classes.

The change, which still must
be approved by the faculty,
was prompted by the large
number of requests for Chanr
ging of grades.

Under the present rule, stu-
dents can change a Credit fail
to a grade with two weeks left
in the semester, but cannot
change the other way after the
first four weeks ofthe semes—

ting and was relieved by
second baseman Eric Hines.
He lasted less than two inn-
ings and was replacedby How-
ie Horwitz. The parade con-
tinued with third sacker John
Videtich taking a crack at the
job; first baseman Bill John*
son finished up. Once again,
JC Labowitz was passed by.
Against Simpson, Grinnell
scored first, sending seven
hitters to the plate to edge
over a run in the first inna
ing. Simpson got that oneback
immediately, then scorednine
unearned runs in the second
and third innings to ice the
game. Apart from those two

Tennis Team Wins One, Drops One

The Grinnell tennis team
made the long trip to North-
field, Minnesota, lastweekend
where they moved their con»
ference record to 4-2 by los-
ing to St. Olaf 8-1 on Friday
but-rebounding to defeat Carla
eton 574 on Saturday.

The squad warded off tire
trouble, unfortunately in re-
trospect, to arrive in time to
be soundly beaten by the strong
St. Olaf team. St. Olaf won the
conference last year and is a
strong contender for the title
again this year.

Olaf's Don Halverson, who
defeated the Pioneers' Brad
Vazales, was the top singles
player in the conference last
year. Dave ”Psycho"Beeman
was the only Grinnellian able
to cut an Olaf jock down to
size as he won at the #4 sing-

innings, however, Grinnellag-
ain played solid defense. Hit-
ting continued to be a prob
lem, though, as Simpson pit-
ching repeatedly gave the Pi-
oneers scoring opportunities
which Grinnell failed to cap-
italize on.
One promising note is the
obvious improvement in the
team's play, however. There's
still an outside chance at a
victory, though probably net
this weekend as the Southern
Division powerhouses come
in. The Pioneers play Mon-
mouth Friday, then host Knox
in a double header Saturday.

Saturday Features Bike Rally

Bikeology day will be ob
served throughout the nation
tomorrow. Grinnell is plan-
ning some of its own activi-
ties to try to increase the
awareness of people concern-
ing the environmental des-
truction caused by cars and
the subsequent advantages of
bicycles.

A rally will be held in Cen-
tral Park, next to the Civic
Center on Broad Street start»
ing at 1:00 Saturdayafternoon.
In addition to speakers from
the college who will discuss
the ecological aspects of cyc-
ling, Mr. Sowerwine will con-
duct a workshop on bicycle
repair.

America has become a car-
centered society. Bikeology
day will hopefully encourage
some people to change their
life style and use the more
ecologically sound bicycle ra-
ther than a car. Studies have
shown thatbicycles lend them-
selves well to local trips, res
quiring less space forparking

and use on the road, do not
consume as many natural re-
sources and are much cheapr
er to maintain. They are also
much more beneficial for the
health.

Practical suggestion for im~
proving conditions will also
be discussed. In many locali-
ties it is not safe to ride bi-
cycles because of road condi—
tions. If paths could be estab‘
lished to provide easyand safe
wcling routes, there wouldbe
a greater chance ofeffectinga
change in life style. Provi»
sions should also be made on
buses and trains to transport
bicycles. Bicycles should be
built to serve transportation
purposes rather than just as
toys, and safety features she
ould be established to de-
crease the rate of bicycle
theft.

Cycling gives each individual
a chance to make a contribu-
tion to a better environment.
Help solve the problem, don't
join it.

les position. In the doubles,
both the Ken Schofield ,. Jim
Spell and Bruce Bonneweli -
Pete Doering duos managed

to go three sets, but neither .

won their match.

Following the match, this
columnist, searching the Olaf
locker room for the secret of
melt success, discovered a
sign probably posted by an
excited Olaf jock who had
finally been admitted toa grad
school. Its maxim read, “Ath-
letics are the root of all
knowledge."

For those of us who search
vainly for an “ultimate tr-
uth”, this new rather unorth-
odox method may rival the
currently popular but over-
rated method ot transcenden-
ml mediation. It was while
considering the possibilities
suggested by this sign, thatl
remembered a poster from
Grinnell‘s own physical edu-
cation office that reads ”Get
high on sports, not drugs"-~
a slogan that suggests new
avenues for those whose most
recent chemically-induced
trips have been bummers. If
indeed athletics do possess
the intellectual merits and can

produce the physiological ef-
fects advertised by these two
posters, the possibilities are
staggering. The new PE com-
plex could become the sound-
est academic and social in
vestment ever made by the
college, "jock" colleges could
possess benefits we never dr-
eamed of, athletic recruiters
might be busted as pushers,
and the long-awaited massive
rebirth of interest inathletics
at Grinnell could be just
around the corner.’

Getting back to tennis, the
following day against Carleton
things didn’t begin much bet-
ter than they had against Olaf,
as only Brad Vazales and
Bruce Bonnewell managed to
win in singles. In the doubles,
however, despite being inter-
rupted by rain twice and fin-
ally moving to indoor wooden
courts, the Pioneers rallied
to sweep all three doubles and
edge the Carls, 5- 4.

This weekend the Pioneers
play at Eeloit, Monmouth and
Knox in three important mat-
ches that will conclude their
dual meet schedule. NeXt week
is conference meet to be
played in Cedar Rapids.

Trackslers Splil Two Meets

During the last week, the
Grinnell track team saw ac-
tion twice. On Friday, the
assorted group of the talented
athletes were assembled on
the fairly new track to contest
Cornell, which proved n0t to
be much ofa contest. The meet
was won (82-54) before really
getting on the trackas Grinnell
claimed first places in six of
the seven field events. Trust»
ing in the words of some lily
pad swimmer destined for
somewhere, "It's not enough
to win, one must humiliate,“
was the word of the day. Eric
Jahn tied for first with Fill
Morales in the mile and for
first with McGrath and Jon
Russell in the three—mile.
The "star" of the meet was
record- setter Christopher
Madsen in the pole vault. He
rOcketed skyward about EX’
actly 14' 1 1/2", smashing
school and field records in
the process. Double winners
were Dave Wright and Jim
Pirolli. Spear-chucker Dicks
won the elephant-spearing

On Saturday, without Huffand
others, Grinnell was tromped

as Chucky McGrath won the
