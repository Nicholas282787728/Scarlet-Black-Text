0 SUNDAY NEW DEAL

It has long been our rather timid opinion

that of the somewhat morbid chapel pro-
. gram here at Grinnell the Sunday Vesper

services are the outstanding feature.

Yet, at times even this part of Grinnell’s
religious life has seemed to us to border
upon the trite. Professers are quite all
rightiin fact, they even seem to be some-
what necessary to an institution of higher
education. But then, five days a week are
quite a group of time . . .

Hence, it is with frank approval that we
have noticed the recent increase in off-
campus speakers at the Vesper services.

Nor does it appear that we are the only
ones who welcome this variation from the

wintendrab routine of learned department
heads. For not' even our beautiful (‘2)
spring weather has eaten into the very
credible attendance at these services And
inasmuch as Rabbi Mannheimer is to con-
tinue this commendable trend next Sunday
afternoon, it is to be hoped that the same
commendable trend in the attendance will
also be continued.

Bringing these speakers to the campus
entails a great deal of spade work which
is relatively unsuspected by the average
student.

If these efforts are to continue, it seems
only fair that the deserved appreciation be
expressed. We express that appreciation
through these columns. Will the students
express theirs through Vesper attendancei
or do we go back to the old Onrcampus
schedule? G

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“I hope you never belong to Youth with a
capital ‘Y.’ You ought not to be marked
off as a special pressure group because of
your age, just as women shouldn’t be
marked off because of their sex. You are
not a special class, but citizens.” Mrs. Rob-
ert Taft, wife of the G.0.P. presidential
hopeful, told University of Minnesota colr
legions the place they ought to assume in
national affairs. G

“The youth of America comes to the doors
of our colleges with hope and vision. Their
spirit is the spirit of adventure. Their urge
is the urge of growth. Thei ' principle
qualification for admission is curiosity.
Their most valued recommendation is the
deslr for better things. The ilnest equip-
ent is courage and determination to succeed
in a World of opportunity, They are en—
dowed with the talents of normal human
beings and are burdened with the frailties
common to all men. Thi is the material
with which the college \l'Ol‘kS and no finer
task may be found in all time than to create
from this matelial a product that can be
recognized as a gentleman and a scholar."
Rutgers university’s Dr. Fraser Metzger apt
ly describes the “raw material” of higher
education.
