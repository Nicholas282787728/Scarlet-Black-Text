The plan of financing is the
cause of greatest comment.

Several students have expressed
opposition to the plan, because
they feel they will receive the
publications anyway.

However, there is no assurance
that such may be possible. For
example, when the Cyclone room
deposit fee plan was approved
last spring, it was with the under-
standing that a permanent and
sounder financial setrup he work-
ed out next year. .

There is no assurance that the!
college or board of trustees would
approve a continuance of the
policy to support partially the
annual Irom appropriations from
the room deposit of the individual
students.

Similarly, the Scarlet and Black
is now paid for out of the general
funds of the college, not the
semester fee. This plan, which

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

has been operative for several
years, was also adopted only
“with reluctance” on the part of
the trustees with the understand-
ing that the students at an early
date work out some other plan
for financing the student news»
paper.

There is no obligation on the

part of the college to continue the’

present method of financing the
Scarlet and niacin It was merely
an emergency measure, approved
by the trustees with the idea the
students would assume responsi-
bility in the future.

The method of payment of the
55 fee also is the subject of con-
siderable misunderstanding

Briefly, the idea is to increase

the all»inclusive fee from $700 to
3,705 yesrly. This extra fee, pay-
able to the treasurers office, would
be turned over to the board of
publications in payment of the
students' subscriptions to the
Scarlet and Black and to the
Cyclone, senior annual.

Hence, the student would not
pay the $4 for tho annual ($2
irom his room deposit and $2 in
cash), nor would the 75 cents now
going to the Scarlet and Black
out of the general college funds
be used for that purpose That
75 cents would instead be used to
pity for the operating expense of
the college.

In, other words, each student
how subscribing to the annual
pays $4.75 for publications. Under
the new plan, he will pay $5, and
the 75 cents he now pays for the
strident newspaper will revert to
the college fund.
