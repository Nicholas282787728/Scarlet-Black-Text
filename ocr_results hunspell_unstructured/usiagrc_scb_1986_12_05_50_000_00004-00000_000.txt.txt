Speculation concerning external forces
contributing to Grinnell Colic s struggle
to maintain a stable, qu fled faculty
results in finding fault with expectations
from and limtations of an atmosphere in
wllich teaching is emphasized over
scholarly research A question many
students as.well as faculty Wlll be asking
next semester is. “Who’s leaving this
year?”

The sometimes heard assertion, refers
red to as the “brain drain", that Grinnell
has an inordinately large faculty turnover
rate. and that these losses are concenr
trated among Grinnell’s best professors
was rejected by Catherine Frazer, Dean of
Faculty, Frazer stated that the turnover
rate is presently six to eight percent and
these losses primarily consist of
retirements and professors being
recruited to other institutions. Frazer Cons
ceded that there are also some professors
who leave because they dislike Grinnell's
location and “want a college or university
in a metropolitan area... (but) this is quite
a small number.”

Nevertheless. Thomas Hietala, Assis-
tant Professor of History since [all 1935,
points out the ramifications for students
that a shifting faculty has. Says Hietala,
“When a well~respected. key professor
leaves, studen are discouraged and
faculty stability is injured "

Class, Size and
Course Load

Various conclusions as to the reasons

professors leave Grinnell abound, Faculty ,

number of students (including students

Grinnell was 1268. with racuity numbering
1013. For this year. the student population
is 1393 with 107 faculty members.

Frazer refuted the charge that this in-
crease in students imposed greater
workloads upon faculty members as
“simply not correct." As corroboration

Research and Sabbaticalx

Perhaps the most discussed aspect of a
faculty member‘s motivation for leaving
Grinnell is the inability to do research due
to an increase in the student body. course
load and class size. exacerbated by the
present sabbatical program.

Most collegelevel professors and ad-
ministrators believe that faculty members
should remain protessionally active while
concentrating on teaching skills.

Said Henry Walker. Associate Professor
of mathematics. “A top-notch faculty
member must be aware of what is going on

in his field, It is important to have an up

teaching a‘ first priority; other schools
have priority on research."

having a faculty well-informed on cur-
rent issues has clear benefits for students.
A delicate balance between teaching and
research is necessary because “the best
teachers will also be interested in
research. time must be‘allowed for that."
says Jonathan Andelson. associate pro-
fessor of anthropology

Frazer refuted the charge
that the increase in
students imposes greater

workloads on faculty as

”simply not correct. ”

To achieve this balance. Grinnell Colr
lege finances many professwnal con-
ferences and speaking engagements, The
college pays travel and lodging for one
conference a year hietala commented.
“currently Grlnriell provides more
frnone'y) for teachingrrelated innovations
than for scholarly innovations."

Dean Frazer cited the newly instituted
Harris Faculty Fellowship as evidence of
Grinnell's efforts to help new professors
pursue additional research. The
fellowship, which allows professors in
their second and third years to submit a
proposal for a year's leave, is judged on a
competitive basis. Frazer. referring to the

stress and time demands involved in
teaching, believes that the fellowship pro
vides opportunities “to adjust and get the
time to do things such as complete ones
first book,"

Most publishing projects are completed
during sabbaticals. but not all research
can be put off until then. Onrcampus
research is easier for some faculty
members than for others

As it operates currently, faculty
members are eligible for sabbatical leave
after six years of continuous teaching at
Grinnell. A faculty member has the option
of a year's leave at half pay, or a
Semcmstel' leave on full salary, The first
step in acceptance for sabbatical leave is
the submitting of a proposal to the depart»
inent chairman; after approval. the pro
posal is reviewed by the Board of Trustees.

ideally a professor should be able to take
a leave whenever lsl he chooses, but Cons
nelly pointed out the flaws inherent in such
a system. “We have to have people
teaching the classes .if professors could
go on sabbatical every year. only half the
professors would be left to teach.”

A veteran of two sabbaticals during his
eighteen years at Grinnell. Wubbels favors
increased monetary support for faculty on
yearrlollg leaves. Wubbels said this could
be implemented along the standards used
[or the Harris Fellowship. "l would like to
see full financmg for the hottest two or
three research programs . this would give
faculty much greater freedom.“

Frazer feels that Grinnell has a» par-
ticularly fair sabbatical program because
there is no limit to the number of leaves
granted "1 think that, without exception

'all proposals for sabbatical leave are
