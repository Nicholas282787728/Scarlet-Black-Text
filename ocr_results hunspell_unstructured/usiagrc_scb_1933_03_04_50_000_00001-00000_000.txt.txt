Records Fall

as Tracksters
Lose to Drake

Bulldog Runners Annex

Indoor Meet Friday,
60 to 40

weakened by the lack of pole
vaulters and dash men, Coach Lester
Duke’s Grinnell track squad was ole.
feated last night by the Drake univer-
sitY runners, 60 L0 40, at the Drake
fieldhcusc.

Five Records Broken.

Five records were broken during the
evening with a. victory in the mile run
by Mike Pilbx'ow leading the list. Filo
brow trotted the 12 lap stretch in
4227.2 to shatter both the meet rec-
old and the fieldhcuse mark by five
seconds, being tailed two paces by
Grant Thompson, Drake runner.

Probably the most interesting race
of the evening from a Grinnell view-
point, was the quarter-mile, in which
cavcaplain Alexander nosed out Gal-
laghel‘ of Drake after a close race.
Without the services of Anderson the
Grinneil milerrelay team was defeat-
ed.

Smith Wins Two

Frank Smith of Drake won first 7

places in both the high jump and
the 50 yard dash to take scoring hon-
ors for the evening, and broke a rec-
ord in the former event. Pilbrow of
Grinnell could have shared honors
with a double—victory, but was forced
into a tie for first in the two-mile
run, with his team-mate, Joe Phieffcr.

Drake scored eight; first places and
the Pionecrs accounted for four. The
Bulldogs gained all of the points in
the pole vault, as the locals failed to
enter the event.

of the game remaining, to put his
team in a four»poinl. lead.

Good Passing Dentures

Accurate passing on the part of the

standing reasons for its success, for
on numerous occasions the ball was
worked within scoring distance by
series of long and short passes.

Duncan's ability to sink baskets
with his left arm returned to him in
the game and two of his ringers were
made in this manner. while ullrich
adopted a long-range shooting eye to
drop in two swishcrs,
