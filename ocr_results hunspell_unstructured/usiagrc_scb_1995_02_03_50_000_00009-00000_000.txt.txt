LETTERS
TO the Editor

Grinnellians should
listen to different views

I extend to you my praise for your
most recent editorial, “Is Gnnncll Realty
Liberal?" Thctssue has been ignored for
far too long. It is time for the entire
college community to fully realize and
confront the extent to which dogma and
narrowAmindcdncss have stiﬂed and
shackled our freedom to think for our-
selves, On utis campus between stur
dents and faculty, there is one common
trail which binds us all together: we are
all scholars As such, we must value
above all else critical thinking and the
exchange of tdcastn an environmentfree
from dogmatic hostility.

Our first and most important step,
then,shouldbetl'tcact;ordarlee ol'rcspcct
to views different from our own and lhc
willingness to listen to what others say
even tfwe vehemently disagree wiui uie
contentoftheirideas Thisisnotsomuch
something which we ougtrt to do, but,
rather, a responsibility which we are
compelled to do. For if we do not grant

hunlan dignity to those whom we per»
ceiveasdil‘lerent from ourselves, we rob
ourselves ofany claim to decency and it

is we who then become the true monr ,

sters. Though our steps may falter and
the path of tolerance prove difﬁcult be
cause it challenges us, it is nevertheless
the one path wide enough to accommo-
date all of us
