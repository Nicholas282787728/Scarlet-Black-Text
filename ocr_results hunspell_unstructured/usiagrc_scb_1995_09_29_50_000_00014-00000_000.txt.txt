Students to choose
mugs or styrofoam

Scon— ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

In response to pressure from
EAG.EnvironmentalActionOroup,
the Forum has decided to give cus-
tomers the choice of sryroronm or
plastic cups

EAG member Laurie Dick ’97
brought a petition with 250 names to
Director of Dining Services Dave
McConnell asking that plastic cups
be used in the Forum again, McCo<
nnell has agreed to try givmg stu—
dents the option of styrofoam orplas»
ric starting Monday. Twelve plastic
cupswill be available for use with the
usual $2 charge,

A large problem in the past has
been students putting down the $2
deposit fee and not returning the
plastic cups. To meet this problem,
the Forum had to keep a large stock
of cups, which they don’t have room
for this year. Ifcups aren't returned
during the trial run, the Fonim will
go back to only using styrofoam.

week to remind students and staff to
return their cups, They Will put a
reminder in the Campus memo and
post signs around campus.

Students are welcome to buy
mugs for $2, but they need to tell
Forum personnel the money is not
for a deposit, Gnnnell has special
Sesquicenrennial mugs forsale. Any

Campus mugsstudents have from new
student days or otherwise also can be
used at the Forum for beverages.

Dick wanted to correct an error
in information about the styrofoam
cups, They do not contain CFCs;
CFCs have not been included in
styroioatn for eight years. Rather,
the problem is the excess solid waste
styrotoam cups generate. McCon—
nell said Dining services is looking
into recycling possibilities for the
stytofoarn, but there are very few
Styrofoam recycling centers in the
US.

The renovation orthe grill and
the loss of sales are the two reasons
cited for moving from plastic mugs
to styrotoam this year. An upright.
refrigerated, display case for bever—
ages like Snapple and a freezer for ice
cream were added this summer, The
new coolers take tip space that used
to be available for storage of cups.
Sales of beverages, ice cream, and
softdrinks are brisk this year. accord
ing to McConnell.

Plastic cups at the Fonim have a
long history, When the mugs were
first introduced for beverages there
was no deposit fee and 4,000 mugs
were taken in two years. A small
deposit of twenty five cents was tried
next with little success. Finally, the
two dollardeposit was implemented,
and while cups were returned, sales
dropped. With the use ofstyrofoam
cups, sales are back up.

Students reprimanded for streaking

ALLISON SHAW
STAFF WRITER

Streaking seems to be an ever—
present hobby of American youth,
but it seems to be occuring unusually
often this year at Grinnell. Tom
Ctady, Dean ofStudent Affairs, cons
firms that he has been hearing an
unusually high number of complants
about it. The most recenton—campus
incident occured at the “Supermodt
e1" Harris party earlier this month.
This resulted in several warning let-
ters being sent out to the individuals
involved.

The quiet atmosphere of

Grinnell College helps facilitate
streaking,saysaregularstreaker. “No
one's going to arrest you for running
around naked,"he believes. Howev-
er, Stephanie Stephan—Meyers, Di-
rector ofStudent ActiVities, warned
streakeis in the disciplinary letter
that there is a legal nslt; “Any stu—
dent could choose to press indecent
exposure charges against you. It is
their right." Indecent exposure is a
legal misdemeanor.

The college administration
hopes to deter streaking sooner rath—
er than later, however, Stephan»
Meyers explains, “Grinnell College
has a very diverse student body, The

Harris Center needs to be a place
where all students can feel comfort.
able and enjoy themselves."

The administration does not
haveasetpolicy dealing withstreak/
mg to allow ﬂexibility for dealing
With specific circumstances. Crady
says that the college deals with com—
plaints about streaking the same way
it deals with most other complaints.
The administration tries to reach a
solution so that all students can be
comfortable. Stephan—Meyers said
thatshe hopesthatstudentswillheed
the warning letter and avoid becom-
ing repeat offenders.
