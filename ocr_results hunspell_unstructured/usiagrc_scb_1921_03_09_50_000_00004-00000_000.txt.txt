it was during his ﬁrst wcok in Grin-

out ior as many activities as he lios~
silily could. while in High School
he lldd looked in 3. Woman‘s Eyes and
had round them good. He was now

Some children also believe in Suntiti

So he prepared to make his Illtlu»

hies that had been let loose to graze
upon the iowa Prairies. He made the
t‘nllegc Dancing Team, throatcd a
nasty tenor on the Glee Club and he-
came a First Nighter at every movie
house in town. These three accoms
plishinents, plus an occasional lllV'itZIr
tion for dinner, were about all that he
needed to entice a icinale into know-
ing him.
He louud the One Best Bet and the
Quad became his Only Place of Wor-
ship.
Not only did he push a Peppery Pen
and thereby aid the literaiy enter-
prises hut he also punished the Pesky i
Piano, having the opportunity to note
the methods various couples used to
display their friendship on the dance
tloor.
Fearing he would miss some or the

Heavy Hitters for frequent engages

jaded nerves thrill when they threw
the Three: and Fives under the tahlo.

Secret Conclaves and succeeded in he-

ning things. including his girl's car.
His schedule for study was nicely ar-
ranged—he did it on Sunday Arter-

He lasted until the Second Semester.
