LETAND BLACK joins the editors
of the woman’s edition which ap-
peared last Wednesday in the hope
that the ladies of the college in the
future shall consider it a part at their
course to issue one number or the
paper annually. The success or the
ﬁrst venture has heeii;:siitlicieiit to
warrant the undertaking, a tact which
we believe is generally recognized.
' Certain it is that next year's board or
lady managers will ﬁnd the example
or this year's board to be one worthy of
emulation and that the excellence of
last Wednesday's issue uill bc sutli-

213’ the Lewis Literary Society of
the Grinnell Academy, Iowa Col~
legc possesses an organization otwhose
success she may well be proud. The
trinmpli of last Monday was distinct
to he sure, but only typical oi the kind
that has characterized the whole
history or the society. In their career
ot thirty-tour years the Lits hare lost
only one debate. and that to Morning
side a year ago. Such uniiorm suc~
cess as has come to the men‘s academy
society surely is abundant testimony
as to the earnestness oi the work it
does All honor to the Lewis Lits.

HE large score made last night at
the gymnasium by our basket
ball team presents the college cham—
pionship question to the public in a
light which is decidedly more iavoi-
able to Griiincll than that in which it
had been previously regarded. Up to
the time of the game an Iowa riotory
on Monday was every whereconsidered
as assured and the championship was
looked upon as good as settled. Those
u ho saw last night-‘5 contest are not
willing to make such concessions.
Let no one stay away trom Monday’s
game on the ground that it is aiorlorn
hope.
