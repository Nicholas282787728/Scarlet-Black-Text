China and Taiwan Agree

On High-level Visit

BEIJH‘IG - The ﬁrst talks between rivals Taiwan
and China in nearly three years ended Thursday
with an agreement that Taipei's top negotiator
could visit the mainland this year.

The breakthrough came in a 30-minute meeting
between Jan Jyhahomg. head of the delegation
from Taipei’s semiaofﬁcial Strais Exchange Foun»
dation, and Tang Shubei. vice-chairman ofCltina's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).c

“The chairman of the Taiwan Straits Exchange
Foundation, Koo Chenrfu. is welcome here to take
part in activities or symposiums the two organi—
zations hold." China’s official Xinhua news
agency quoted Tang as saying.

Jan said he hoped Koo could visit by the end of
the year. Tang said Beijing had eyed an earlier
date but could be ﬂexible.

”The timing is no problem," Tang said. “So long
as the two sides make proper arrangements,
ARATS could invite Mr. Koo anytime."

Jan also met the association‘s Li Yafei for talks
he said helped to pave the way for future ex-
changes. Jan is to leave Beijing Friday.
“Although these talks were not wide-ranging.
meeting face to face can help the exchange of
views and mutual understanding," Jan said.
Thursday‘s sessions were the ﬁrst meetings be-
tween the two sides since Beijing angrily broke
off discussions following a private but high—pro-
ﬁle trip to the United States by Taiwan President
Lee Teng-hui in March 1995.

Rwanda to Stage Executions

Despite Protest

KIGALI - RwandaThursday ﬂatly rejected an ap-
peal for clemency by Pope John Paul before the
public executions Friday of 22 genocide culprits.
Speaking at a news conference in the Rwandan
capital, Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana dea
fended the executions, which he said paled into
insigniﬁcance compared to the 1994 genocide that
claimed the lives of an estimated 800.000 people.
“It (the executions) will teach people that no one
has the right to exterminate other people with im-
punity and that human life is sacred." Gasana said.
Patrick Mazimhaka, minister of state in the
president's ofﬁce, said: “We didn’t hear the Pope
asking for forgiveness then (in 1994).”

The ﬁrst executions of those found guilty over
the ethnic massacres of 1994 are due to be carried
out simultaneously by ﬁring squads at ﬁve differ-
ent locations at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) Friday.

Candidates for Grinnell College President Visit Campus

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Staff Writer

From a wtdening pool of candidates,
the Presidential Search Committee se-
lected two prospects to visit the campus
this week. Dr. Ellen Hurwitz and Dr.
Thomas Flynn arrived Sunday and Mon»
day nights respectively. each to spend 40
hours getting acquainted with members
of the college community.

The visits were the product of an on-
going screening process initiated in Feb-
ruary when the search committee began
scrutinizing nominations for college
president. Since the beginning of the year.
the committee has amassed over 250 ap—
plications from leaders in academia and
related ﬁelds. ,

Both of this week's candidates have
strong academic backgrounds. Hurwitz.
who earned her BA. from Smith College
and completed her Ph.D. in history at Co»~
lumbia University, spent the last six years
serving as president of Albrighf College.
where she led a successful effort to re-
structure the faculty. administration, and
board of trustees. Before that. she had
other administrative and teaching posts at
Wesleyan University and Lafayette Cola
lege. .

Flynn spent the last ﬁve years as pro-
vost and Vice President for Academic
Affairs at Millikin University, where he
led efforts in restructuring enrollment
management, recruiting minority faculty,

Presentation

BY SARAH REINHARD
Staff Writer

A slide~lecture focusing on the lifetime
achievements of one of America‘s great-
est composers, William Grant Still. will
be given at Grinnell College this April.

Judith Anne Still. daughter ofWilliam
and President of William Grant Still Mur

‘sic, will show a collection of rare and

unique photographs depicting her father's
life from birth to death.

The presentation will encompass many
valuable contributions Still made to the
blues. early radio. and grand opera.

“The pictures introduce African-
American history. racial prejudice, and
American music," said Still. who has been
presenting such information across the
country since 1982.

William Still's contributions to music
and history are notable. He is distin-
guished as the ﬁrst African-American to
write and conduct major orchestral and
operatic works that are enjoyed by listenr
ers of different races and nationalities.

William Grant Still Music was re-es-
tablished in 1983 in order to promote the
achievements of this skilled musician, and
to encourage the works of minority and
women composers in general.

“We have an interest in wipin g out ste-
reotypes.” noted Ms Still. “We want to
eliminate all kinds of prejudice."

Judith Still promotes such causes in her
nonrﬁction freelance work. which focuses
lnainly on issues regarding William Grant
Still's music.

Dr. Ellen Hurwitz, above. and Dr Thomas Flynn both
visited campus this week as candidates for president of

ministered at Mount Saint Mary’s College
and participated in the Institute for Edu—

to highlight

She has also written a book on
the Holocaust. a subject which
holds personal signiﬁcance for her.

“My mother was Jewish." Ms.

Still said. “and our landlady and
landlord in California had both
gone through the Holocaust. Jews
and African—Americans have had
similar problems with prejudice
and non-acceptance."

The goal of combating such
prejudice, one step at a time, has
permeated Judith Still ’5 work with
William Grant Still Music.

She is particularly interested in
eliminating stereotypes that sur-
round the work of AfricanaAmeri-
can musicians such as her father.

“It is felt in many circles.
though people don’t say it. that
people ofcolor should stay in their
place," she said. “that they don’t
belong in some of the higher cula
tural arts. such as opera."

William Still’s race often pre—
vents his work from receiving the
recognition it deserves.

To this day. no major opera company
produces Still's music, whereas George
Gershwin‘s popular Porgy and Bess is
widely performed.

“They won’t accept black music from
the horse’s mouth," Ms Still said.

Nevertheless, Wi lam Grant Still Mua
sic has made a positive impact on the ﬁght
against prejudice. and listeners have re
sponded by purchasing a great deal of
music from the company.

Colleges search for new ways to diversify

BY AMANDA MCDONALD
Daily Texan (U. TexasaAusrin)

(UVWIRE)AUSTIN. Texas _, Univerr
sities nationwide should look beyond afa
firmative action to foster diversity on
campus. panelists told university audi»
ences during a national video conference
broadcast Monday.

“We need to avoid preaching to our stur
dents and provide opportunities for them
to challenge the present value system."
said Caryl SteranaRosa. a panelist and
Vice President for Development of the
Local Initiatives Support Corporation in
New York.

The live broadcast. titlcd “Beyond Afr
fin-native Action: Maintaining Campus
Diversity in a Divisivc World." was a na-
tionwidc program designed to encourage
colleges and universities to participate in
diversity discussrons on their campuses.

Other panelists included John Noonan.
President of Bloomﬁeld College in New
Jersey; Ruben Arminana. President of

Sonoma State University in California;
and Larry Roper. Vice Provost for Stu—
dentAffairs and Professor of Ethnic Stud—
ies at Oregon State University.

Though the majority of Americans
agree on a similar ideal of campus lecl’r
sity. the way universities should go about
achieving that goal is debatable. said
Arlninana.

“There are differences between af-
firmative action and diversity." he said.
“We have this gap between the ideal we
want and the strategy that wc are fair
lowing.”

Arminana added that even with afﬁrr
mativc action policies, university ofﬁcials
should consider other factors in admis-
sions decisions.

“Afﬁrmative acuon‘s intent was not to
be an admi ion policy." he said. adding
that retention and graduation rates oftnir
nority students should also be studied.

Educators should begin Stresstng the
importance of a diverse environment as
early as thc K-i2 level of education so

that the issue won‘t be foreign when stu»
dents reach the college level. Arminana
said.

“We need to look at the beginning of
education. so corrections can be much less
at just a college level," he said. “So the
idea of afﬁrmative action becomes obso-
Icte. which is clearly not arcaiity. but that
is the goal."

Roper said emphasrzing a sense of
community on campus should be the ﬁrst
step in creating a positive atmosphere
among students.

“We should be creating a community
we want to live in.“ he said. “We must
eliminate the isolation and the anonym-
ity among students."

Noonan emphasized the intricacy of
the issue.

“It's teaching all of us to treat our sub-
jects and institutions in more complex
ways." Noonan said. “With diversity.
we‘re compelled to confront the fact that
we're on an uneven playing ﬁeld."

 

follow-up rcierencing, we judged them
to be particularly good prospects who
warranted [a trip to campus.]"

Receptions. meetings. and tours were
scheduled for each visit to foster famila
larrty between the candidates and the col-
lege community. In addition to meeting
wlti’t the faculty. administrative staff. and
SGA. candidates also attended question-'
and-answer sessions with students.

Steve Langerud. Director of the Ca-
reer Development Ofﬁce. helped facili-
tate these question-and-answer sessions.
“I think they went well." said Langerud.
“Students asked very good questions and
were engaged with the candidates.”

Initially. students had planned to ask
ﬁve pro-determined questions at the be-
ginning of each session and then open
the ﬂoor to further dialogue. Langerud
and Associate Director of Admissions
Karen Kristof had worked with students
last week to formulate these questions.

However, because the ﬁrst meeting
with Hurwitz seemed to lend itself to a
looser structure than anticipated. the secA
ond meeting‘s agenda was facilitated
more openly. Rather than adhere to a
rigid set of questions and answers. stu-
dents and candidates in both sessions
“had a very good dialogue." said
Langerud.

Still. issues addressed in both sessions
were largely consistent. Questions con-
cerning multiculturalism. town-gown re—

Frustration With
Appeals Process

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

During her four years at Grinnell.
Alice Asher ‘98 has ﬁled two appeals
against academic policy. And she‘s won
them both. Nonetheless. Asher is one of
many students who ﬁnd fault with the
appeals process at Grinnell. The under.
lying issue is the lack ofrespect that stu-
dents feel from administration. Asher
said. ”[There is] a lot ofevasiveness. You
have to be so aggressive to get it [and]
no one wants to be that aggressive to get
what they deserve. The fact that you have
to beg for it is humiliating.”

A senior who wished to remain anony-
mous agreed: “Either no process exists
for doing [an appeal] or you are informed
that the appeal may not be worth your
time. either implicitly or explicitly.“

Asher commented. “If you really care.
they tend to listen to appeals. but you
have to be loud about it.“ In order to have
her appeal addressed. Asher wrote let
ters and made numerous phone calls.

Frank Thomas. Vice President for HuV
man Resources. commented, “I think it's
very student friendly. The appeal process
is something that is going to have some
difﬁculty due to emotional involvement."

Students are most dissatisﬁed with are
the appeals processes of the Committee
on Academic Standing (CAS) and Off—
Campus Study (OCS). Unfortunately.
Associate Dean Helen Scott. head of both
committees. was unavailable for com—
ments.

CAS handles applications for excep-
tions to academic policy. as Well as pro—
bation / suspension / dismissal issues.
Dean of Student Affairs Tom Crady. r.
member ofCAS. said that although most
CAs decisions are ﬁnal. they may be ap
pcaled to the Dean of Academic Affairs
or the President of tlre' College.

OCS has it board which decides
whether students are granted permission
to study abroad. Students who are not
granted permission may appeal the deci-
sion. The student may ask Associate
Dean Helen Scott to allow a hearing be
fore the entire board. IfScott decides that
the case warrants a hearing. the appeal is
addressed

The dissatisfaction of many students
lies in the fact that the appeal returns to
the same board. Douglas Emmett. ‘98
said. “At Grinnell. the authentic appeals
process is nonrexistant. It’s basrcally that
one has to ask the same person who
turned you down in the first place to re
