liltET ll,\1iTll S’I‘ORY
IN SCREEN nltluu

No author at American ﬁction oiicrs
a morc iertilc hold ior the dramatist
lllun docs nret Harte, whose tales oi
ihc west oi thc mid—nineteenth century
are classics.

The creator of those inimitahle
characters, .iach Hamlin, the straight-
shaotius gambler, Col. Starbottle, the
bombastic gentleman oi the old school
who would ﬁght at thc drop oi a hat,
Mr. John oahhurst and other immolu
tals, is the idol oi all lovers of genu—
ine American ﬁction.

One oi the greatest oi Harm’s tales,
Marilja, has been dramatized tor the
screen undcr the title oi "The Gray
Wolf's Ghost." NO less an actor than
H. B Warner, iamcd on two conti—
nents, assumes the role oi Harry West
in this production, which is irom the
Hampton studios, released by Robert-
son—Cole as a Super Picture.

In the screen iorm the story takes on
a vitality and picturesquchcss which
heighten the dramatic eiieot and lend
color to a graphic tale. Additional
interest is given to the production,
due to the iact that the locations used
are identical with those oi Harte's
story, and the atmosphere at the early
California days is reilected in every
detail.

Mr. Warner, than whom no ﬁner
actor has ever appeared in the silent
drama, is admirably cast in the role
of Harry West. the Stranger who go-
ing in search at his rather, by whom
he and his mother had been deserted,
to demand an account oi his steward—
ship oi his mother's iortone, becomes
involved in the machinations oi a hall-
crazed Spanish ianatic. Accused at
his father‘s murder and about to be
lynched, he is saved by one o: the
strangest and most unusual dramatic
contreterops ever utilized in drama or
ﬁcﬁon.

A notable cast, comprising rtita
Stanwood, Marin Sais, Ed Piel, Hector
V, Sarno, violet Schram and George
Field, supports Warner.
