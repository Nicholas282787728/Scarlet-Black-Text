The Student Council has pondered a suggestion recently
that a student represent the studentbody on the Person-
nel Board, .,

It isn’t exactly a new idea for a group of people to
want to be heard at the place where decisions affecting,
them are made (George Washington fought a War over it|
back in the 18th century) and it‘s a pretty good one. The
physical presence of a student on the board would be sev-.
eral times more effective than a letter, resolution, or re—
quest on a scrap of paper.

It is true that the Personnel Board goes into individual
problems, however. But come to think of it, so do the
League Board and the Council of House Presidents

The incident, as the whole Roger Long
world knows,

started with the

 

 

‘ ,rect method of financing

with support by the student
body of Grinneli college. We
feel that there has been a def-
inite- need for a change in the

lsystem of financing the annual

for many years.
A subcommittee from
Student Council has wrx~kcd

Vwith us in studying the silua-i‘
men as it exists at liberal arts

instltutions in our conference
and other small colleges in the
Midwest. The letters from Mid-
West conference colleges reveal

with the single exception of St,
Olaf, that their yearbooks are:

financed through an activily
fee that is comparable to the
total of our semester and social
fee, 25 dollars a semester, Here
are two of the replies:

“I don't see how we could
ever put out a book under
your circumstances. I an see
no disadvantagss to the sys
tem we are under. and
many. many advantages."

#Carleton

“To be truthful, i don't
understand how in the world
you ever get your book into
the/printers on time with
the Setup you now have.
You have my sympathy.
Honestly, i never heard of
such a stupid way of paying
for an annual, i thought i
had it bad!”

We feel. and the qub-commit-
tee of the" Student Council backs
us 100 per cent, that an indla
the
Cyclone has a number of def-
inite advantages, as is evidenced
by the large number of schools
which use this system. An in-
direct method of financing would
benefit each
at Grinnell because:

i. A bigger and better
planned book could be pub-
lished. Only a small minority
of the student body does not
purchase a book; thus, the
needless formality of selling
subscriptions could be elim»
inated at a time when each
student has other expenses
that must be paid The rc-
sults is that the editor could
begin work at the beginning
of the school year, without

The moral degradation of those
incendiaries is past the hope of
even the most forgiving of men,
We can only pray they will
turn their faces from the sight
of men and repent the grievous
sin that they have committed.
But let us leave them to their
fate.

opportunities to compete against
each other in a variety of activa
itics that include Homecoming
decorations, the retzer sing, and
‘thc dance inlramurals. These ac—
‘tivities have become traditions
because they fulfill a three—fold
{purpcscz providing entertain-
mcnt, fostering hall unity, and
giving opportunity for expres-
sion of special talents.

Despite the fact that the dc-
cision becomes a part of.ihe
[past within 24 hours, the point
still remains that the judgment
made should be as objective as
possible. This is because many
hours of sincere effort are giv-
cn over to preparation of
such contests and to have any-
thing other than the most just
decision possible is to create
a negative attitude toward fur-
that participation and effort.
The conduction of the recent
rctzcr sing, however, was only
another item in a series or in-
cidents which have occurred in
the last few years.

Whenever the judging of such
activities is done by people as-
sociated with the students it
has a two-fold effect: 1) The
judges themselves realize that
they may be prejudiced by their
own decision, which in itself at»
iects their decision and it puts
them in a difficult position. 2)
‘The students feel that prejudices
of the judges may have affected
the judgment, whether any per-
sonal feeling actually did exxst
or not, The result in any case
is dissatisfaction.

We wish to point out [he
need for a standardized method
of conducting the decision by
the judges. When the judges

rd like to congratulate Lan»
gan hall for fielding the only
softball team which has been
‘able to stop Mighty Cowles. Al-
though Langan has won just
one game thus far and has re-
mained otherwise obscure in
this year's intramural warfare,
it has the distinction of stopping
the hall that has retired the
MacMurray trophy.

by Bruce Cole

Cowles now has the respon—
lslblllty of starting a new travels

ing intramural trophy and there
is. perhaps, no hall that has a
better name to immortalizs this
iway. Cowlesman noy O’Leary,
latter whom the new cup will
probably be named, was one of
the greatest intramural athletes
;of recent years. He-died before
he could graduate but he left
deles hall a memory and a
tradition which has pproduced a
kind of hail loyalty and fellow~
ship which is more than worthy
of this latest honor.

I see that we're having the
fourth edition of the annual stu-
dent musical this year but who
is its director? lf Norm Cohen

much. B st of luck, mystery

last two fiascos in that stuffy
auditorium rm repared for

talent seems to be in the horse
