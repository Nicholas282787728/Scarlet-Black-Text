Perring Named Dean
inf Modern Languages

Roy H. Perring, professor of Ger—
man, has heen named dean of mod—
ern languages. The romance lang-
uages and German have been come
hincd in this department.

John M. Smith, former chairman of
romance languages, has been away
from Grinneil on leave of absence to
study at Harvard. His acceptance of
a position at Smith college necessi-
tated the combination of Italian,
French, Spanish. and German into
one department and the hiring of a
new associate professor, George Sei-
ver.
