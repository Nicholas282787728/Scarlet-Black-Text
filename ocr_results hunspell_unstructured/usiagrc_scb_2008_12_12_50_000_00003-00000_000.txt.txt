Town debt at high level,
but steep cuts not in order
IivJEFr RiIDERsTRoNG

The ongoing ﬁnancial crisis has crept into
all corners of the globe, bnr, tor now, it seems
to have largely bypassed Grinncll City Hall, at
least for now.

The city of Giinneu is assuming increaSr
mgly greater levels ot‘ debt and approaching
the legal limit allowed IIndeI Iowa law But
despite the mere e the City still an vs some
wiggle room, ti administrators att bntc the
reccnt increasc in city obligations primarily to
new construction projects completely unrelatr
ed to the meltdown on \th1 Street

The city is in pretty good shape, said
Giinncll hlnvor Gordon Canilel d

The three construction projccts—Ihe
Drake leialy, the Grinnell Public Safety
Building and the Gnnnell Family Aquimc
Centeriwill all be completed next year, te-
ducing the city’s debt, according to City Cleils
l<ay cmelik.

Not only will the completion orthcse ploj-
ecrs reduce the city's debt, but they will also
help raise property values and increase Humble
revenue for the city, according to Canﬁeld.

“We have enough new construction going
on and enough increase in market valuesi
and therefore taxable values, that as long as we
don’t take on anyinore [spending] than what
we have, we‘re ok," Canﬁeld said “And we
won’t take on more."

The increase in property values will also
increase the staterasslgned debt “capacity" for
Grinnell,

The state oflowa assigns each city a capaCr
ity debt it can take on, an amount equal to ﬁve
percent of the value or all taxable property in
the ci . According to Cmclik, the ceiling fol
Grinnell comes to roughly 23 million dollars,
and that the city is currently at 85 percent of
that capacity

Typically, the city tries to operate at “no
more than 50%" of the capacity, Canﬁcld said.

Next year, Cineljk said the debt should
be reduced to 82 percent orthe capacity, with
further decreases in the following years But,
Cmelik said, this calculation does not take
into account prospective increases in property
valnes,which would allow for a slightly higher
debt ceiling.

Canﬁeld is wary of the overall economic
situation and said he will not hire any new stair
in the coming years, to avoid budget strain. But
he said he would not cut Staff, either.

“We‘re not laying~otf anybodyithat’s not
in our plan at this point,"Canﬁeld said,“[ButI
that‘s always an alternative."

Canﬁeld recognizes that Grinnell might
have to adapt if times become ﬁscally harder,
but he thinks that city ofﬁcials can nppropri»
ately handle the situation.

“We‘re a conservative bunch," Canﬁcld
said. “We aren’t going to spend more than the
revenues coming in."

School Board to cut
$500, 000 from budget

BYJEFF RitnLRsutoNG

Amid the recent announcement that the
us. economy has ofﬁcially been in a recession
for almost a year, the Grlnnelerewberg school
district made an announcement on its own FIST
cal health—that a $500,000 cut must be made
to their budget for the coming school year.

Enrollment in the Grinnclercwbcrg
school district has been in Steady decline over
the past decade, falling from almost 2,000
students in 1997 to just over 1,700 last year.
Because Iowa gives districts tnndrng based on
enrollment, this has caused problems for the
district.

“Student enrollment has been steadily
declining for the last 15 years said Crlnr
nell-Newberg Superintendent Edie Eckles,
“Howevel .. , our annual expenditures have not
decreased proportionally They have, in tact,
Increased "

This problem is notsudden and the district
has been working on it since last spring, when
they had to dip into their reserves to cover
their budget, According to administrators, the
reason the district did not make a major cur
last year was because of the desire for commu-
nity input.

“People said that ‘This was coming to us
(00 soon, wed really like you to delay making
seveie cuts, because we'd like time to think
about it,” Eckles said.

In the meantime, the district made what
Ecldes called “soft cuts," such as delaying the
purchase or new textbooks or trying to reduce
energy costs. Some of these attempts were not
so successful,

“I have not seen anybody trying real hard
to save energy," said Eric Pederson, president
ofthe School Board,

Last month, the tnne came to discuss ma-
jor cuts to the budget and the district hosted a
meeting, inviting all community members for
lnpun The response was varied and at times
contradictoryisome asked for a fourrday
week and others wanted year round schooling,

“With those kinds of dichotomous re-
spcnses, we won’t please everyone,” Eckles
said.

School Board members said they will note
these suggestions as they try to balance the
budget, which is to be ﬁnalized in midrFebrue
ary of next year.

“The role of the school board is to take the
feeling of the community and adjust and find
out what's best for the community," Pederson
said.

Overall, the school district recognizes the
severity of the ﬁscal situation, but feel that
they have the resources to make the changes
they need without too great an impact on the
community.

“We are not in dire straights.” Eckles said
“We should have been trimming the budget all
along, we didn't and now were going to have

to.
