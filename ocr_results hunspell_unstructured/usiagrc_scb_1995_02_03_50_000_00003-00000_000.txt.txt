RINN'ELL willbreak ground
n midrApril for an expan—
ion on Bowen l-lnil ofScir

encethatwtll mark the onset ofa$ 13
million renovation and construction
project, The entire science building
will be renovated, the science library
will be moved and an additional
[4,000 square feet of space Will be
added.

Professor James Swartz. who is
overseeing the project, said that cola
Icge officials have been considering
the projectforslxorscven years. The
need for the expansion is threefold.
he explained.

Swartz said that the “way of
teaching sciences has changed smcc
Bowen was built." He explained that
when the building was built, profes»
sors lectured. Now. he said. students
and professors need classrooms dc»
signed for discussion, more desk
spaceandl'acilitiesdesignedforgroup
work. Lab usage has changed over
the years as well, he noted. as scienr
tific study has moved from observa-
tional to involved research requiring
more instruments and computers.

Secondly. Swanz said the ex-
pansion will provide better facilities
to students conducting summer re-
search. Last summer. 67 Grinnell
students conducted research in the
science building.

Professor Swartz cited the third
reason for the renovation and expane
sion as a simple need for more space.
He explained that there are now one
and a half times as many students
taking science classes as there were
whenthebuildtngwasoriginallybuill.

The project will take place in
phases to accommodate use of the
building during construction Biolr
ogy research labs will be clustered
around instructional labs, allowing
students access to specialized equip-

mentduringelass, Acomplex offour
rooms, includinggeneralandorganic
chemistry labs, an adjacent instru-
ment room and a room equipped for
discussions and data analysis will
support chemistry instruction. The
library will be designed to take ad
vantage ofelectronic access to infor
mation. Colnputers in all areas will
be on the college network, allowing
access to Internet,

Bowen HallofScience wasconr
strueted in 1952 and was expandedin
[964 and 1986. The new addition,
designed by the Chicago architec»
tural firm Holabird 5; Root, will wrap
around the 1952 and 1964 wings,
unifying them and providing a new
exieriortothebuilding.Alargcglass-
walled atrium will provide a new
entrance that will be more inviting
than the current lobby. A tworstory
hall with skylights will have spaces

areas," designed to encourage group
work.

Swanz said that without the addi»

tion. Grinncll would fall behind other
colleges such as Carleton and
Macalester, wllich recently have added
new science facilities. With the addi-
tion, he said, Gnnncll will have scir
encc facilities that fully meet modern
standards for liberal ans colleges.
Swartz added that the construc-
tion “will be disruptive for the next
two years, but we‘ll try to minimize
that." The project will take longer
because the building will need to be
usedwhile underconstrucu‘on. Swanz
added that the prOJCCI was like a
“kitchen renovation," and that a little
inconvenience now results in a better
space and a better college later.
Swartz noted that renovation of

arts building expansion and renova-
tion project because ofdiffering con-
struction plans scheduled by their
respective architects. Swanz saidthe
architectural ﬁrm thatthe science de-
partment chose had a construction
schedule that started a year earlier
than that of the fine arts department,

 

SCOTT from page 1

“The Bodyguard" 7 in which main
character Whitney Houston never
takes off her clothes 7 prove that
Americans are sick of all the sex in
movies,

With Rose, Scott discussed the
sexualization of athletes. She said
that although, as Rose pointed out,
not all athletes want to be role mod
els or sex symbols. as long as they
are used to sell things on TV and as
long as “sex sells." athletes will be
sexualized, and children will grow
up with heroes who have been sexur
alized.

Scott noted that she thinks
her perspective gained from
American Studies is valuable on
talk shows like “Last Call" be-
cause she can legitimize discus
sions on subjects like “Is there

too much sex out there?" by mak-
ing important, valid points about
American culture.

"They need people who can
quickly frame questions and of-
fer solutions, and as a professor
I’m able to do that," she com-
mented. Scott has been asked to
appear in three more “Last Call"
editions in February on the top-
ics of gay and lesbian love, mo-
nogamy, and why people at un-
derground sex clubs aren‘t pracr
[icing safe sex,

Being on TV and getting the ope
portunity to have serious discussion
with other luminaries would seem to
be excitement enough, but Scott ad-
mitted that the best things about doing
“Last Call" were “getting to ride in a
limoand ﬂying ﬁrstclassiitwasmy
first time!"

0U may have noticed a
major change in the
amount of course work

required by your classes this semes-
ter. Ask around. Everybody seems
to have more of a work load than in
previous semesters. I have noticed
this phenomena myself.

There is a reasonable explana—
tion for this. It can all be traced back
to a meeting that the powers that be
of this college called to order while
we were all off on our personal en-
deavors overwinter break. The pure
pose of this meeting was to discuss
how the college could improve the
upcoming semester.

“What problems did we have in
the last semester?" the organizer
asked the group.

“Some students tried to burn
down Gates, and they set ﬁres to
postersinCowles. Thishastostop,”
one of the meetings participant
noted.

“That’s good," the organizer
cemented. “Anyone else."

One of the participant stated
rather vehemently, “The students
smoke too much pot."

“Any others?"

”Our U.S. News and WorldRe-
pan ratings for liberal arts colleges
are slipping. That's a bad reﬂection

 

~—Current—~

on us." one of the scholarly types
reported.

“Okay, these are some very
good points," the organizer said as
she scribbled down some notes.
“What can we do about this?"

Silence engulfed the room for a
good half of a minute. Finally, a
quiet man from the hackof the room
explained his vision for a better se-
mester. “Why don’t we give the
students more course work —— give
them more readings, more tests and
quizzes, and more essays. This will
undoubtedly boost our U.S. News
ratings because our classes will be
more rigorous. Also, students will
be too busy to smoke pot or start
fires."

A woman sitting near the orga»
nizerexclaimed,"That'sagreatidea!
The best thing about it is that the
students can't complain because
we’re not actually taking away any
oftheir rights. It‘s not as ifwe were
instituting room searches and cur»
fews. All we’re doing is giving
them more work to do."

At this point the organizer took
the opponunity to end the meeting
by saying, “Let’s puti'tto a vote. All
in favor, raise your hand.” The vote
was unanimous. “With that vote,
this meeting is adjourned. Now
let's go down to the bar and drink
some beer."

this leave the station? What will the
new KDIC be like? Format manager
Jon Rose thinks the new situation
actually may improve the quality of
the station by creating an atmosphere
ofshared responsibility.

“It‘s going to be such a big
love affair," Rose said, like a
giant Kibbutz with all of us do-
ing our part."

Rose was quick to point out that
KDIC is continuing to rorge ahead
where noGrinnellian has gone before.
This semester the station will smrt
