one oi the crying needs oi tlic day,
as seen by the noted lilierul, is to
make Christianity iiitolligihlc to the
modern mind. Going hack into his—
tory, he declared that it was one or
the lamentable truths oi the ages that

theologian littered these

elite, love, mind, and have

words
“Friends, I have taken up these ﬁve
elements of man’s life; joy, consci-

Stitiure and fullness of Jesus Christ."

The secniid Fustllcl: lecture
delivered this morning on the sublcct.
“The Need oi Modern Religious Lead~
ership," Dr. Fosdlck discussed his
suhiect iroin three dilrei-ent aspects:
the need for a Chi tiaiiity that Will
bring people together, the need (or a
Christianity that will he intelligible
to the modern world; the need tor a
Christianity that will take the religion
of Jesus Christ and dominate the
world.

Very early in his talk, Dr. h‘osdick
deﬁned religion as f‘Llle motived by
visions or God.” Then he ‘ttm'k up
some of the things that religious rer-
vor had led men to do. He spoke of
Soul of Tarsus "breathing threatenr
ings and slaughter against the folloWr
ers of God” as anexample or religion
making a man worse, and Paul, writ-
ing the 13th chapter of I. Corinthians
as an example or religion making s
man better. Speaking of some of the
mistaken ideas concerning religion, he
said, "Some .people believe in a tribal
God who is playing tayorltes among
men. Some people believe in a sec—
tarian God, Faith in God [makes some
men higots. It. Wasn’t lrreligion that
cruciﬁed Jesus, it was bad religion,"
The great theologian likened religion
or today to slsnowhall, which rolling
down the hill or time, had collected the
bad as well as the good. what we
need to do, he says, "is to bring the
great mass or Christian iaith and put
it on the right side or lilo."

Jesus’ Orﬂmtloxy Was Low

Fosdlrk believes that it anything in
the world should he cohesive today,
it should he religion. He touched upon
the question oi religion in ireland andl
the audience was very much umuseil
when he quoted an lrlshmztn’s solilo-

was

Moreover, he believes that ﬁle terms
or the religious thought or the ii
have lost cogency today in our modern
way at thinking. We Consider that
there may he changes in almost every-
thing else, but deny that religion has
that same right to develop as the yeal\
pass along. Continuing this line or
thought, he said, "Mnn's ideas about
God change. As a child, one thinks
of God in child-lire terms, but as a
man, the ways or thinking about God
must change. St: I say, intellectual
vehicles shift and alter irom tune to
time. Yet there is something in relig-
ion that does not change,"

Dr. Fosdick took the homely hut ef-
rective illustratiou‘ or the crab and its
necessity oi moulting to prove his
point concerning the growth‘or re»
ligion. ."Yet I believe in the sov»
ereignty or the Christian reli ion.
Change your rrarhewoi , but keep

heart or Christianity are reproducable

The Gates lecturer spoke of the
many little controversies over
unimportant details such as the tale
of Jonah and the whale. Ninetyrnlne
or a hundred religious controversies
are concerned with little things like
this incident. "What counts in rehg.
