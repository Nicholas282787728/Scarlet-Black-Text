 

I should have gone Super-Chic

I spend a lot of my time deiending Grin
nell College, Even with all of its faults, I
like Grinnell, so that's why 1 find myself
explaining to various people where it is
and what it is. But'l didn’t find out just how
much l appreciated certain apsects of life
at Grinnell until this past vacation. Let me
explain:

My parents and l ventured out to see
what we hoped would be one of the better
movies of the Christmas masssrelease
period: Paul Newman in “The Verdict " I
must explain that my parents don't go out
to the movies very often, so between
Mom's desire to see Paul’s baby blues and
Dad’s desire to see the early show, (half
price before 5 pm ), this seemed like the
perfect choice

We went to see “The Verdict" atone of
those big shopping center movie theaters,
not like the trendy ones downtown where
all of the chic people go. This decision
seemed all right with me; I'm not really
into trendy chic 7 I mean, i just don't
understand how folks could spend hours
getting all decked out in full dress regalia
just to go sit in a dark movie theater. As it
turned out. it may have been better to sulr
fer through super-chic.

“The Verdict." is a very good movie. i
don’t know that I'd put it on lny personal
top 10 list, but it certainly is better than
most oi the junk sputtering out 01
Hollywood these days One of the qualities

Richard Lew/ginger

of ”The Verdict” that gives it that extra
something is the fact that the movie didn't
spell everything out for you.

it is a story about a washed-up and
usually drunk lawyer (Newman) who
decides to fight a case that everyone wants
to settle out of Court “The Verdict"
chronicles his struggle to regain his self
esteem through die process of fighting the
case, But this point is not thrust upon the
viewer; this flick is subtle and stylistic. In
other words, it draws upon the intelligence
and involvement of the viewer to get the
pomt across.

And that is where Grinnell comes in

If there is one thing that is true about
Grinnell audiences, it is that they are in-
telligent. Now i realize that those of you
who have had the pleasure of sitting
through such Grinnell specials as “The
Enforcer,” “Rocky Horror" and “The
Warriors" might Want to disagree with my
claim. but let me be more speciiic

l contend that we get spoiled by wat-
ching movies at Grinnell When I went to
see “The Verdict“ I was surrounded by
such a bunch of losers that it detracted
from the overall enjoyment of the movie
Please note, I'm not talking about the cry-
ing baby We certainly have the equivalent
in the obnoxious behavior of some of our
fellow students during such epics as the
aforementioned “Rocky Horror" and (a

personal favorite) “Flesh Gordon " No,
I’m talking about the actual comments
that you inevitably hear from the people
sitting around you in the movie.

when I saw ”The Verdict" I heard come
ments unparalleled in movledom: As the
judge asks Newman if he’d like to begin his
summation, uie woman sitting next to me
turned to her husband and asked plainly,
“What?” To which her husband replied,
“That means he‘s going to finish up;
dear!" 0r there was the point at which
Charlotte Rampling is revealed to be the
true femme fanale of the mowe, Upon
figuring this out, the woman behind me
blurted out, “Snitch, snitchll”

Maybe the audience was worried about
how an out-oiework alcoholic lawyer was
able to get. his shirts cleaned? How he was
able to pay his phone bill if he hadn't had a
case in four years? These, my friends,
were the kind or great questions plaguing
my ielloiv movie viewers. .

Obviously i am being a bit rough on
these people, but there is a point to be
made here. When you see a movie at Grin-
nell, you can take for granted a certain
level of intelligence among the audience:
an intelligence that produces insightful
and tusually) witty comments I'm here to
tell you that it ain't like that In the real
world, so enjoy the type oi movie viewing
you get here. , . while you can

A matter of conscience John Kerr

It may be one of the oldest conflicts' that
sometimes anonymous and monolithic enr
tity called the state will pass a decree or
institute a law, and an individual or group
of individuals. because of a moral judge-
ment they uphold, will find the dictates of
the state in conflict with their conscience
It is the stuff Of dramas (Witness

-Sophocles' Antigone or the recent moVie
"Gandhi”J. But for those unwilling to
distance themselves from life's realities, it
is an unenviable conflict that they may
eventually come to face.

A matter of conscience is not an appeal
to religious fanaticism or an unleashing of
repressed passion. One critic defines cons»
cience as, “the capacity to make moral
judgements about oiie's own actions. it is
purely subjective in nature and opera
tionally can be defined as that inner lame

which compels a person to do or to re/usz to do

something.

oftentimes an issue will enrage our sens
sibilities, it Will raise the ire of our sons
oience and then quietly lapse, Our
energies are needed elsewhere, our atten»
tions are diverted, and we withdraw from

the fray, Not every issue is of life-and»
death importance, not every battle is
David versus Goliath. This is the process,
this is the way we school ourselves in
passivity. In itself, a conscience is not
socially beneficial, and Since we habitually
retreat from engaging it, it atrophies.

Millions of people around the world are
terrified by the proliieration of nuclear
weapons, Many are convinced the only
way to avoid nuclear annihilation or con»
i‘rontation is to disarm now. Many of us
Will agree with this‘, many oi us will agree
that this is of lileand-death importance.
Many of us, myself included, withdraw
from further consideration of the issue,
(There is, it seems, a limit to how many
times an individual can listen to or read
the arguments for the waging of a
“limited," “safe” nuclear war.) The OP,
posite oi inaction, however, is action, the
opposite of civil complacency and obe»
dience is civil unrest and disobedience.

In her letter to the 5&3, Janette Funaro
stated she was reluctant about calling at
tention to her actions became that might
imply they were “special or courageous."

An Invitation .

Last semester 1 had the opportunity to
serve as a hall president representing my
dorm every Wednesday night at the SGA's

j Joint Board meetings. The semester was
filled with much anxiety and frustration
for many of the members who wished that
more could have been done, but never-
theless I feel that the board did accomplish
a few important objectives which seem to
have been made cloudy or have simply
been overlooked,

Of course the social and activities more
dinators should be praised for their fine
job at putting together an enjoyable
semester for all students. But I feel that
the most important accomplishment and
one which should be continually improved
upon is that oi opening the lines of coins
munication between Students and the ad
ministration and between students and
SGA,

Students last semester filled every
available committee position open to
students, not only for the SGA committees
but also for administration committees,
For many of the committees, candidates
had to be turned away because of the
limited number of positions. Student in-,
volvement with administrative commit—
tees is important for the open channels of
communication between students and the

administration Student involvement with
the many SGA committees is also very im-
portant in obtaining the widest variety of
student opinion possible in planning and
working out SGA iunctionsr

Last semester Joint Board spent an inore
dinate amount of time working on the
much publicized bylaws and other rules
wiﬂi which to involve and inform more of
the campus community. it is these bylaws
and rules of which the SGA and the cam-
pus should be most proud. The SGA voted a
new business bylaw which would prevent
the board from voting on any issue that
was not first published in the minutes or
advertised to the campus community,
With this bylaw the board eliminates hasty
votes on issues which the rest of the cam-
pus may want to discuss and debate.
Because the agendas ior the JB meetings
are advertised in the Post Office and in the
Forum, students have a chance to discuss
issues with their hall representatives
before a vote is taken instead of having to
wait until the 5&3 publishes JB decisions
on Friday.

Joint Board also passed a bylaw which
instructed the hall presidents to write a
brief summary oi each JB meeting telling
how he or she voted, how the meeting had
gone, and giving his or her opinions about

that they were exceptional. AS political
awareness is, or should be, a necessary
part of our everyday lives, why should we
be reluctant to take responsible action
when it becomes necessary 7 when it
becomes a matter of conscience? Gandhi
believed that all societies require the cons
sent of the individuals involved. In a scene
from the recent movie about his life, Gan-
dhi tells a British official that India will
secure its a’utonomy simply because it will
no longer consent to its own slavery From
the simple tenet of “withhold the consent,
change the society," Gandhi engaged in
several forms of active, non-violent
disobedience that did change his society.
Several friends of mine took exception to
what they perceived as runaro's holier»
thansthou arid self-congratulatory pro-
clamation, I believe they misunderstood.
By her action, Funaro is denying her con-
sent; by her presence and the presence of
others like her, she forces me to reconsider
my consent. The question is no longer
whether, I consent or not, but whether I can
afford to remain passive about an issue
that is, quite literally, about to explode.

foe Neri

decisions, upcoming votes and events.
This bylaw is invaluable for open com-
munication. Students may now read their
representatives positions on certain votes
and may discuss or debate upcoming
issues with their representatives.

For many semesters the SGA has
discussed many ways in which to improve
student involvement in the SGA, This year,
maybe as an outcome of the turbulent and
messy 1981-82 school year, Joint Board has
tried to make it easier for all students to be
heard. The door of involvement in SGA has
continually opened and closed, but it is
hoped that unis year a doorstop has been
positioned in the form of the new bylaws
and rules,

The final hope of greater student in-
volvement can only he in the students
themselves. 1 hope that each and every
student will take the time this semester to
read the SGA agenda and minutes and to
read their hall president‘s summary oi the
meetings. I also hope that all students will
take the time to communicate their opi-
nion to SGA through their presidents or by
involving themselves in committees or
other functions, Each student has the
chance to affect the decisions at SGA and
SGA committees; the door is open and so is
the invitation!

 

Atlantic City (1981 — 103 min)

The story of the relationship between
two people who meet at a casino, “Atlantic
City" is a film of near-broken dreams and
faltering fantasies. Exi“RoCky Horror”
star Susan Sarandon plays Sally. a clam-
bar waitress who dreams oi becoming a
Monte Carlo dealer and enlists Hie help of
Lou, a smallstime hood, in her efforts to
earn the money she needs to realize her
fantasy, Lnu, played by Burt Lancaster,
has a dream of his own, however: to
escape the tawdry casinos of Atlantic city
and his life of nickel-and-dime crime,

The means to both their ends is provided
by Sally’s ex»husband and his dealings
with the mob. By participating in a large
mafia drug deal, Lou sees an opportunity
to become a “bona fide” crook and also
secure the money needed to send Sally to
Monte Carlo,

Through their ensuing experiences,
something oi each iantasy is salvaged, and
the two characters emerge from their rela
tionship more fulfilled and satisfied.

"Atlantic City" is an enjoyable film,
despite some vagueness with respect to the
plot and the motivations of the characters.
However, its freshness and realism is per
vasive and makes the film well worth sees
me.

The Philadelphia Story (1941 — 112 min.)

This all-time classic is, without a doubt,
the weekend's best choice. Making her
Hollywood comeback, Katharine Hepburn
is superb in her starring role as a young
Philadelphia socialite who is as beautiful
and intelligent as she is cold and unl'eeling.
Her character is developed as she pro-
ceeds from one romance (and marriage)
to another.

Also featured in the film are John
Howard, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart,
who won an Academy Award ior his per-
formance.

To some extent. “The Philadelphia
Story" spoofs snobbery, yet it is not
without certain insights about the pro-
blems encountered by those “to the manor
born." In the end, “Philadelphia Story"
succeeds in doing what few films can:
thoroughly entertain without losing a
perspective on the realities oi the lives and
circumstances of the characters it depicts.

Easy Rider (1969 7 94 min,)

Directed by and for members of the
15605 youth culture, “Easy Rider”
documents the exploits of two motor-
cyclists who use money earned from sell-
ing drugs to journey across the United
States. Together diey visit an array of hip
pie communes and ranches, attend the
Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and befriend
an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer
who joins their entourage. _

Starring Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper
and Jack Nicholson, in his first major role,
“Easy Rider" is superbly produced and
succeeds in its attempt to convey the
estrangement of youths in the ’60s. Direc~
tor Hopper creates this realism by using
actual conversations among townspeople
on location

While some scenes of the men “on the
road” may be a bit tedious, “Easy Rider”
is worthwhile as a means to better unders»
tand the restlessness and dissatisfaction
which characterized the decade.

El Super (1979 7’90 min.)

The second of this semester’s foreign
film series, “El Super." addresses a vital
segment of modern American society: the
Hispanic ‘emigre’ culture,

The plot revolves around Roberto, a
Cuban exile, who has been a building
superintendent in New York City for 10
years, and has looked at the world from a
“basement point of View" while holding on
to his persistent dream of returning to
Cuba or Miami, ”where at least it doesn't
snow.”

Described by The Village Voice as enterr
taming, amusing and moving, “El Super"
promises_to be a high quality film in~
dicative of the caliber of the entire foreign
film series.
