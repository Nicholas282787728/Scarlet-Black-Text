Grinnell student
sparks media frenzy

A Grirrncll student's statements in last weck’s $81? ignited
a national media ﬁrestorm and even has the chanec to inﬂuence
the Democratic presidential race.

Muriel GallotChasanoff’lo told the S88 that the question
she asked at a Hillary Clinton event in Newton, Iowa, had been
planted by a Clinton staffer.The article,entitled “Clinton aides
plant student’s question,” was put onlinc on Friday afternoon,
and by thatrirglrt,callo-c1rnsanott's report had been broads
cast on the Fox News Channel and confirmed by the Clinton
campaign.

But instead ofplaying itselt out and being buried by Cover
age ofthclcffcrsontlackson Dinner, the story took on new life.
A second man came forward with a story ofa Clinton staffer's
attempt to plant a question with him in April, although the
details ofltis story are still under dispute.

Additionally, rival candidates directly addressed the is
sue, driving up new media coverage. Despite suggestions by

$650 remains

SPC adjusts after funding crisis, but
looks ahead to new semester support-

ing service and other student groups

BYABBY RAPOPORT

The Student Programming committee (She) now has
5650 to allocate over [he remainder of the semester. “That is
basically nothing," said Brad Bishop '08, SGA treasurer and
head of SPC.

But the fact that SPC will probably not run out of funds
before the end of the semester is an accompbshment, given that
the committee allocated $16,600 of its 821,500 budget in the
first five weeks. In the midst of the budget crisis, SPC also had
to oversee a community service fund and attempt to create new
procedures for funding service groups. Given these dimculties,
svc will likely carry this semester's lessons into the spring.

 

 

Harris platforms potential hazard?

BY CHRIS NEUHERT

When a Harris dance platform collapsed on former
ACE coodinator Julia Bottles '08, she was lucky not to face
severe bodily injury. As it was, she remaincd in awhcclchair
for several months.Two years later, confusion and questions
persist over the role of party organizers in setting up plats
forms before Harris panics.

In an informal arrangement, Bottles said she agreed not
to sue if the College would repair the damaged platforms
and signiﬁcantly change their party set-up policy.

Bottles pushed to have Facilities Management set up the
platforms before parties. “I was told that wasn’t practical,"
she said. “And I was also told that it would make more sense
for the Harris dcsrt attendants, who are paid to set up Harris,
to be trained and able to put those platforms in place."

Current ACE coordinator T], Hawley ’10 said party or—
ganizatron should be “a collaboration between patty orga-
nizers and [Harris] staffto take platforms out and put them
away."

“Organizers don’t do it on their own," 5er added, “but
thcy shouldn’t Expect someonc also to pill‘ [the plntr‘onns]
up.

Bottles, an $5319 writcr, feels that asking students to mav
ncuver heavy equipment is inherently dangerous.

“It's irresponsible to ask students to do that when they
don’t understand the implications of something going
wrong,” she said.

The administration views Bottles’ incident as an i507
latcd cvcnt, and feels that the repaired platforms and the
new policy have significantly reduced any danger. “It was

unfortunate,” said Senior Associate Dean for Student Life
Michael Sims ofthc incident,“but we haven’t had any other

, problems."

But Sims also said this new policy differs little from what
existed when he first came to Grinnell. “What they’re be-
ing told now," Sims said, “is that a minimum of two people
should put the plat-forms down because they are heavy at
the end, they are asked to put the platforms away."

Few are aware otthis policy. At the recent Oral Hygiene
party, organizer Spencer Green ’08 said, "When [the party]
was over, and even setting up, we chose not to move the
platforms ...Wc wcrc unclear about their policy."

Green said that Harris staff ultimately assisted them is
setting up the platforms, which is consistent with the cur-
rent policy requirements.

If there is no activity on Saturday, the platforms stay out
after Friday Harris par-tics.

Sims added that funding challenges mean that Hart
ris staff would be unable to put up the platinum without
the assistance of party ornan‘r rs “The amount of fundmu
tor student nployment has been decreased {or the second
ycai,”Silns “It doesn‘t make sense to have several Harris
srurrcomc in to set up platrorms,"

Sims said tint he would be willing to discuss options
with studcuis concerncrl ubout the use of Harris t rti‘orrns.
“Just bccausc we've been doing it this way doesn’t make it
right,"hc said.

“Iftherc is going to be change,” Hawlcy added, “it must
come from students.”

Bottles thought that it already had.

According to committee member Alex McKinlcy'OS, SPC
salvaged its remaining funds by paying close attention to re,
quests. “We did that through really examining the budget’s
that came in and making all the cuts we possibly could," he
said. spc scnt people

“I don‘t feel like we've been unduly harsh,"Bishop said, add-
ing that he still was not happy with some outcomes.“Wc'vc had
to cut or deny funding to groups that did have good idcas
but had shakier proposals

These cuts did not apply to community service organiza-
tions, requests which SPC also oversees separatclv. After allot-
ting $10, 000 to community service last year, SGA chose to only
put 53, 000 towards the groups this year

This decision came after the college created a budget for
Alternative Break, and movctl the Community Service Center
to the Chaplains office, overseen by Chaplain Deanna Slrorb.
Unfortunatelv, Shorb was unaware that SGA had cut back on
its comrnunitv service allotment, learning only' in October

After realizing the miscommunication, SGA put another-
52,000 towards community service groups, tilting the money
from STIFund and concerts, which will be paid next semester,
