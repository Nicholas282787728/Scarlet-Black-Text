Grinnell, 1a., Wednesday, May 5, was
Qﬁhitoriul

EB HERE 5 a well delined bee
lief that larger crowds and
fully as large receipts, with a good
deal more enthusiasm would [6'
stilt it smaller admission charges
were made to athletic contests.
The ﬁfty cents usually charged is
often more than the contest is
worth to the ordinary spectatttr
and a slnallerfuc would often draw
a much larger crowd. The home
meet was an example ol agood
attendance, yet the admission was
only thirty-ﬁve cents. Why
would not other contests at lower
prices Show the same resins?

AF there is one class ot people
for whom Grinnell has no
room it is the “knockers." In a
small college the cooperation of
all is necessary to the success ol
any undertaking, yet there has
been adecided tendency on the
part ot a few to “knock" on our
athletic teams. This spirit is as
equally as contemptible when dis-
played by upper class men as by
Freshmen. We desire that every
one support our teams but it you
feel that you personally, cannot
support any team, then tor the
good ot the college please don’t
knock, for that variety of chin
music is alike disgusting to triend
and toe and unworthy of an Iowa
College student.

RINNELL has not been
$ successtul ot late seasons
in athletics as tar as a string cl
victories is concerned. But vice
tories do not measure the value
ofan institution nor the loyalty
of students. Athletics are s'ill

successtul in Iowa College. Per-
haps deteats will help us take a

saner view of athletic work. But
because we are not 'winnlng VlC
torics is not a sign that the spirit
is dead. Anyone who witnessed
the meet at Ames in the cold and
in the mud can testify to that.
We have seen every meet tor ﬁve
years in which Iowa College has
had a part, and last Satulday tor
the ﬁrst time we saw a runner
falldotvn in the mud and crawl
across the line tor a place. The
game athletes are not all dead or
graduated, and as long as Grin-
nell athletes make such ﬁnishes
there is no need to tear that the
true spitit of Grinnell athletics is
on the wane.
