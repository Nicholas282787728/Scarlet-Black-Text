Farmers Cun’i Slay, Can’t Quit

by Nancy Breul

Despite the fact that Grinnell is
situated in the midst of one 0! the
richest iarmlands in the country
most Grinnell students know little
or nothing about the tanning come
nlunity (think of the number of stur
dents you know lrom Chicago). In
an attempt to rectity my own educa
tion I conducted It short study for a
sociology Class which examined the
relationship of the Government, Le.
the Conservation Department, to two
very diiterent types of Iarmers:
l) the Ial‘mer who has eIlicient and
large production and is theretore
highly involved with the Government,
Z) the small and essentially ineiiir
cieiltly producing Inrmel‘ who is inr
teresied not in expansion but in
maintaining a comfortable standard
ot living.

Mr. S, was born and raised on a
farm. Out 01 seven brothers [our
went into tarming. His father still
farms and Mr S. rents his land from
the widow of a retired farmer. His
wile, a Licensed Practical Nurse,
works part time but mostly takes
care DI the house and their four
young children, a Siamese cat and
a Chinese pug, Mr, S’s {arming
operation is large and complex,
Since he has a family and Ills land
is not paid tor he must produce a
proiit and theretore uses a variety
of chemical and mechanical means
to maximum yield, While at the
same time replenishing the soil so
that it can produce as much or more
the tollowing season.

Sherm and Lil share equally in the
physical labors oi the tarm. Like
Mr. s they have a great deal or
acreage but with an important dif-
ierencerrthey own it. Since the land
is paid tor and they have no depen—
dents, they are not concerned with
producing maximum yield but only
with making enough to acquire needs
not fulfilled by the farm.

Sherm sees no point in farming
his land so has seeded it and lets
his cattle (the number DI which he
has only a‘vague idea) graze on and
tertilize it. They have onemilk cow,
some-chickens, bees, and ,a. lew
sheep. >
Mr. S does not like to use herbi-
CideS 0r insecticides. He is forced
to rotate pesticides because they
lose their effectiveness. He realizes
their potency and above all realizes
the extra Cost ottheir use. However,
he is torced to use them; his crop
would be demolished Otherwise,
Sherrn maintains that all pesticides
are poisons ﬂI’Id should never be
used. He ieels, basically, that the
land should not be tampered with.
Unfortunately his acreage is riddled
with gullies formedby runoff, some
thing the Conservation Department

> could help him avoid. Much of their

erosion is stopped, though, one to
the {act that they seed their land
down.

Here are two extreme types or soil
conservationists One [eels no need
to plant his land so he seeds ltdown
and lets his Cattle iertillze it, His
son is conserved and built upthrough
lack Of use although some is lost due
to run on The other type oiconsere
vationist makes maximum use of
his land He has a tremendous inoner
tary turnover unlike that oiany small
farmer He uses the latest in ier~

tilizers, pesticides and erosion pre-
vention techniques to maintain a
yield that will allow him to continue
the next year. Although technicallya
conservationist, he is depleating the
soil through constant use and adding
unnatural chemicals the eilects oi
which have yet to be totally assessed.
The ”technical” conservationist
is ot much more importance to the
government. The government is
basically interested in l) aiding
the Iarmer produce ettectively , a
process done through the Conservar
tion Department and 2) controlling
what and how much the iarmer pro-
duces as executed through the snare
Crop program that in very general
terms pays the tarmer tor not pro-
ducing certain crops in order that
the price stabilizes at a pointwherc
the larmers on the one hand arc not
going broke, out on the otherare not
making so much protit as to stop pro-
ducing ettectively. The small “cone
sei'vatlve” larmer can not be con-
trolled enectively He has no sub-
stantial interactions with govern-
ment departments and is not prone
to monetary enticement. However,
he is ot really little'interest to the
government since his production is
essentially inetlicient

a man like Mr, s encounters adil-
lerent problem His lather still is
iarming and he is old enough to start

Propose Small

by John Wylie

After two weeks of meetings, the
Library committee Tuesday sub-
mitted their recommendation to the
administration on the steps which
should be implemented to Create a
Black Library Their proposal would
establish the Black Library as a secs
tion of the Twentieth Century Room

The proposal provides that a core
collection at banks in the Black Stu-
dies field should be added to the cur-
rent collection in the Twentieth Cen-
turn Room “where they will focus the
attentionlot the entire college come
munity on black culture”, The col-
lection would vary in size from 400-
800 Volumes

The committee also recommended
that “in order to identify this its a
center ior learning or the history,
culture, and Contributions of Blacks
t0 the contemporary world” a small
selection oi art, periodicals, and
displays be placed in the Twentieth
Century Room to “complement the
books".

The Committee recommended that
the selection of books he left up to
the head librarian with the consulta-
tion oi the library stall and members
of the black community, It also noted
that student Volunteers to help with
cataloging and other related tasks
would be welcome.

The committee’s recommendation
was considerably dirterent trom a
CBS proposal which had been subs
mitted two weeks earlier. The main
points of that proposal had included
the establishment or a separate
Black Library in Hurling basement
in the rooms currently occupied by
the Dean’s oliices, which would Cons
tain listening rooms, all Aim-Amery
ican holdings, a section olglnss~ett-

out on his own. He must, thereiore,
produce a large yield to earn enough
to get going, and turns to the governe
ment tor help. He needs conservation
help, he nods-bank loans, he needs to
be concerned with the present eco-
nomic situation These farmers are
in the position to be manuvered by
the government

The government now takes this
manipulatable rarmer, and, inten»
tionally or not, places him in the
position where he can’t stay in farm-
ing and he can not quit. As Mr. 3
explains, a tarmer must keep pros
ducing at a tremendous rate to keep
his head above water; he must work
all year round. it a man were to quit
farming, he would be hit by taxes and
would be tairly unequiped tor any
other activity.

Despite the anxieties, however,
even this type of tarmer does not
seem to regret his occupation, This
is the common force behind Sherm
and Mr, S, Although they might dis-
agree ilagrantly on proper land use,
although they might have very ditr
lerent relations to the government,
both are somehow compelled to tarm
[or psychological as wellas iinancial
reasons, As Sherm articulated so
well

“You've got to be crazy to larm,

but I can’t think OI anything I’d

rather do.”

Black library

cased rare items, current and past
periodicals, audiovisual materials
(including microiilm), Airican and
Carribean holdings, and artwork.

The CBS proposal indicated that a
separate Black Library was needed
because oi the increase in indepenr
dent studies and interest in black
studies areas and the college’s at-
tempts to attract more black pror
fessors. It added that such a library
would give credit to an important
cultural contribution which has so
tar been overlooked and would help
alleviate white racist attitudes.

Black Maintenance

Maintenance oi the Black Library
under the CBS proposal would be
handled by black students who are
on work grants or tinancial aid.
CBS noted that this would provide
more jobs tor black students and
would also assure additional atten-
tion tor the Black Library,

CBS library representative Pat
Swansey was contacted by the solo
Wednesday evening {or her reaction
to the Library committee action. She
said that She had been informed of
the action, but would have no com—
merit. “My responsibility is to take
the proposal to the body of CBS.”

Mr Irving, chairman oi the com-
mittee, said that he expected admins
istration action on the proposal soon.
Wednesday he was not aware of
Tuesday evening's action by a group
of black students who Checked out
books irorn Burling and took them
to the Black Cultural Center. In
an Interview with the 5&8, he noted
that the proposal met the needs for
visibility and useability of black
cultural materials, which was, he
felt, the “concept” of the Black
Library.
