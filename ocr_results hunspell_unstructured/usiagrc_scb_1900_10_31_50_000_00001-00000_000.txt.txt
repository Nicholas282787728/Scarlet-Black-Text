Wisconsin-Grinnell Game.

The game between Wisconsin
University and Iowa College at
Camp Randall, Madison, last Sate
urday was a good exhibition of
fast clean football. Although the
Grinnell men played their
usual plucky game they were
far too light for the heavy
University team and the ﬁnal
score stood 45 to 0 against them.
The day was dark and rather too
sultry for the players, but a fair
sized appreciative audience greete
ed the contestants. Grinncl start-
ed off with a dash that took the
Badgers by surprise, On the
kickoff Fislte returned 30 yards
in one of his characteristic runs
through the whole apposing team

 

and though the ball was lost on a
fumble, Wisconsin was held for
downs and the ball again started
towards the Badgers' goal. By
short gains through tackle and
around end and a long punt by
Clarke the ball was advanced to
Wisconsin’s 5 yard line. Schrclb-
er quickly punted out ol danger
however and as Grinuell couldnot
gain. Wisconsin began a series of
terriﬁc linerbtlcks which ﬁnally
forced the ball over for the ﬁrst
touchdown alter six minutes of
play. Wisconsin then renewed
her linerbucking tactics and soon
had the ball near the goal line but
Schreiber fumbled as he went
over and Douglas tell on the ball
for a tonehback. Throughout the
remainder ot the game Wisconsin
kept up the continual pounding
on the line tor big gains, and
this process was only ‘varled by
an occasional exchange of punts.
Only twice after the ﬁrst few min
utes was \Visconsin’s goal in
danger. once the ball being on the
7 yard line, and again when Caps
tain Douglas attempted a place
kick trom the 30 yard line.

ot the evening.

In the last few yearsthcse interr
society meetings have been less
frequent than the enjoyment of
Saturday evening would seem to
recommend. Why not have one
each term?
