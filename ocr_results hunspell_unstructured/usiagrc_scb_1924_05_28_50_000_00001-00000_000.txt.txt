World Powers, Under Leadership
of America, Worked in
Spirit of Prayer.

“A conference begun with a prayer

a spirit of‘lu-ayer-"wostlre subject of
Prof. George Grafton ““ilsml’s last
I-iarvard Eychange lecture at chapel
Monday A, M. Mr. Wilson, who was one
of the legal adviser-s of the Conference
on Limitation of Armaments, gave’nll
in no view of the great assembly in
which.i-epreseutatives of Great Brice
nin, France, italy, Japan. Belgium,
China. the Netherlands and Portugal
participated.

"IL is a hit revolutionary to begin an
international conference with a pray-
er," declared lr. Wilson. “When Mr.
Hughes, in his business—like way, an—
nonnced that a report of the opening
session of the conference printed in
French. the official language. along
with English, had already been dis
tributed among the participants, Brit
and of the French delegation. express
ed his amused surprise by saying.
‘These Americans—they are practical!
The prayer greets the eyes of men he-
fore it reaches the ears of the deity."

Hughes mikes Proposal

The admirals of the navies of
France. Great Britain and Japan were
aghast at Mr. ‘Hughes’ proposal to scrap
the‘ navies of the world wholesale,
On behalf of the United states our
secretary of state agreed to abandon
all our new capital ships. some still
in the process of construction, and on
which ‘33 million dollars had already
been spent, as well as fifteen old bat-
tleships, if the other powers would
scrap their navies on a fairly come
niensurate basis. He proceeded to

_enumerate with unquestionable ac-

curacy the naval resources of all
’other countries represented at the
conference.

"He talked as if it were an American
navy he was scrapping. He might
have been to admiral of any one of
the other navies, so accurate was his
information concerning them"

In Spirit of Service

“The success of the conference,” de~
clared Mr. Wilson. "indicates that the
world has experienced a change of
sentiment. The members of the con-
:er-enee had the consciousness that
they were working for the service of
mankind."

Preceding Mr, Wilson's lecture.
President Main expressed the appre-
ciation of the student body and the
faculty for the lecturers enlightening
discussions.

”His has been a fruitful service to
Grinnell as a college and to Grinnell
as a community. We shall always re-
gard Mr. Wilson as a member of tho
Grinnell family."

Wilson will meet Prof. J. on Gannaa

$465 in Goods and Cash Taken
During Noon Hour — Two
Strangers Suspected.

Pencils and fountain pens valued at
$425 and sin in ciish were stolen from
the College Bookstore Monday during
the noon hour. Tna‘ robber-y
coveredat one o'clock when For-rest

was dis-

Chanmau, manager of the store. re-
turned from lunch.

Investigation revealed that the rob-
ber-s had probably entered one of the
basement windows on the south side
of the library and gained access to
the bookstore through a door connect
ing the stenogmphic room and the
store. They left by the way of the
freight entrance on tthe northeast side
of the library.

Break Cash Register

Practically the entire stock or pens

and fancy pencils was taken. Includy.

ed in the lot were a. large number of
expensive Parker and shaeffer pens,
Access to the cash register was gained
by prying away a portion of the front
with a pair of pliers which were ’Jl-
ken from a drawer beneath the reels-
Let. ‘

This fact together with the general
nature of the rohbsry led local D0-
lice officers and the bookstore mane
agement to believe that the work had
been done by someone who was well
acquainted with the store. The local
talent theory was abundaned the next
day when it was learned that two
strangers, who acted suspiciously,
had you seen on the campus on the
morning of the robbery, It was then
too late to apprehend them,

One of the men referred to visited
the Men's gymnasium Monday moms
ing and talked athletics with Ray-
mond Rogers of the physical training
department. He seemed to be well ac<
ouainted with all forms of athletics
and with coaches all over the coun—
try. He was about as years old.

The other stranger appeared in the
book store during the morning and
told the clerk he had been sent from
the beating plant to investigate the
source of some foul air which had
been escaping. He was conducted
through the various rooms in the
basement of the library and it
presumed that be “fixed” the night
lock on the door between the store
and stenographic room as he passed
through.

stranger Talks to “Bail”

One of the men was again seen dur-
ing the noon hour in the gymnasium
by Dad Richardson who is caretaker
of the gym. He was heard trying the
door of ii. i. Huff's office and when
asked what he wanted by “Dad" res
plied that he was looking for the
coach. “Dad" was thrown off his
guard when the man told him he‘was
from Amos. It is thought that he was
stationed at the gymnasium to see
that no one interfered while his party
nor was at work.

The whole rohbcry was completed in
less than half an hour. Chapman left
the store at 12:10 but remained out-
side talking to some friends for at
least fifteen minutes. The exact time
of his return was 12:45 which would
indicate that the robbery was colu<
plated between 12:25 and 12:45. ‘

Excavation will he started soon for
the $150,000 women‘s dormitory to be
erected by Augustus college, Rock

ANNﬂUlﬂEiWINNEHS

Prize Winning Works of Reynolds,'
Heller and Kauffman Will
Appear This Week.

The winners of the prizes offered in
the three sections of the’ Steiner lite
Eml‘y contest have been announced,
and the successful manuscripts will
appear in the final issue of Verse and.
Fiction, which will be out Monday.
The winning production in the short
story group was "A Lovely Appari—
tion" by Harry Reynolds, Tts clever-
hess of dialogue and its sophistication
are the outstanding features of this
story of the Oscar Wilde type. Al-I
though clever in detail of characteriz-
ation and plot, the story lacks per—
fection of structure.

"A Family Affair," written by Mar—
garet Henely, carried first honor-s in
the drama section. It is a cleverlyl
written one—act play borderingl on the
satirical with a great deal of humor.
The portrayal of the main character is
almost perfectly made, and shows an'
accuracy of detail. The structure,
however. is not of the highest type.
IThe winner in the poetry group,
Roma Kauffrnan, attempted a difficult
task. and succeeded well in her poem,
“Presbyterian Anthology." Her char—
acters are very clearly handled and
although imperfect in form the poem
in blank Verse ista. remarkable piece
of work. '

The magazine will also contain some
of the most outstanding work done
in the freshmen class this year, “John
Bel‘neski” by Ted Peterson and “blon-
day” by Loren Reid.

The magazines will be given out at
English ekaminah'ons; anyone who
fitils to gal, one at that time may ob—
tain them at the English offines.‘

so that no rccords'were broken on
the track. Taylor lived up to expec—
tations and wori both flights of burd-
les, taking the highs in :154, and the
ions in .243. Green also delivered
in these events. taking fourth in both
races. In the \dashes Sonar-weber

tain Mellratb ran_ a nice race in the
half mile and took third in a 1:58.61
race, but the time in the two-mile was
too fast for Meyer to place.

Relays Very Close

The relays were the closest races of
the day. and the fact that Grinnell
placed second in both accounted for
the high standing of the Pioneers at
the end of the meet. They were run
off in two sections and the final plac—
ings given on a time basis. Grinnell
drew the slow heat in the short relay,
and the team of ’Scharnweber, Green,
M. Jones, and Taylor won the section
easily in the fast time of 1:29.7. just
one-tenth of a second slower than’
the Nebraska team which won the
other section. Had there been faster
competition in Grinnell's section. the
Pioneers might have won, In the mile
