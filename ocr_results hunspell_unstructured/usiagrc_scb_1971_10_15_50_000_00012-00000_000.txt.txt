Chiengma

by Andrew Brill

Approximately 600 km north
of Bangkok rests Chiengmai,
situated among rolling moun-
tains, fresh spring air, miles
of rice paddies, and_dense
tropical jungle.

Greenery

We arrived at dawn, and the
crisp chill urging the rising
sun literally shocked our
equatorial blood streams.
After settlingata rather cheap
hotel, and raising the temper-
atures of our deeply frozen
frames under the appreciated
warmth of several wool blan-
kets,

I decided to poke my nose
into the city and assess the
scene. The ensuing walk was
powerfully invigoratingwthe
aid so incredibly fresh, endr
less blossoming flowers,
tropical greenery inhabiting
every niche and cranny, color-
ful chirping birds speckling
the array of foliage, and a
magnificent backdrop of
ascending mountains satur-
ated in rich teaming greens.

Cont rust

The entire scene was cosr
mically enemic~an absolute
antithesis after belching our
way out of the plastic, conges~
tion and radiant cements of
Bangkok. The people glanced
with wide smiles and inviting
grinsr , something we had cons
sistently marvelled at thr-
oughout the Thai countryside.

Thai Home
While making my way dow'na
narrow dirt road in search of
the famed silver crafts and
teek Wood carvings, I ran into
a wonderful Thai fellow. He
invited me into his yard (which
was centrally located among
several hutrlike homes ele-
vated off the groundwith thick
wooden supports) and ln[r0’
duced me to his wife and
siblings (neither of whom
spoke English... a common
barrier throughout Thailand).

As was the case so many
times before, he asked me to

. A Friendly

photograph his little son who
was playing with a fallen ba-
nana leaf and perspiring pro-
fusely under the intense noon
sun. He then led me up the
wooden steps into his house,
and granted me a look at his
onerweek old daughter, cradr
led below the protection ofa
delicate mosquito net.

His wife was beautifullyThai,
and I was deeplystruckby her
open lack of inhibition while
breast feeding her childrtshe
squeezed the milk from her
nipples into a small bottleand
gently fed her newest jewel.

Language Practice

Excited by the opportunity to
practice his broken English,
Chalie (a namehewasgivenby
some fellows at a nearby U. S.
Air Force base) asked me the
usual questions: "Whatisyour
name”". “Where do you
live?". . "Are youmarried7"
....‘ Where are you going?"....
etc...etc....After rapping fora
good while and enjoying the
overwhelming hospitality of
his warm rustic hut, he gave
me hisaddress, reinforcedhis
desire for the photos, and then
bade me farewell with hopes
we ’d meet again.

Temples

I continued my exploratory
adventure and finally ran into
one of the many magnificent
temples which have made Chi—
engmai a center of Buddhist
learning for manyyears. Iwas
confronted by a facade ofglit-
tering beauty: a ballet ofprisr
matic reflections emanating
from thousands of carefully
hand placed mirrors ofinfinite
color and variety.

Inside the wait

An entrance flanked by two
dragon monsters in exquisite
torment and color. And a ser-
ies of doors magnificently
frescoed in gilded gold, den
picting the progressive se-
quence of Buddha’s life. Ienr
tered the wat (Thai,for "tem~
ple.") and was equally imr
pressed bythe interior design:
Another series of frescos.
this time in a variety ofbright

Adventure

colors, covered the walls. An
altar magnificently covered
with golden religious objects
and symbolic prayer pieces
atop a gold and crimson clad
table intricately carved into
lacing wood.

Incense

And among the golden aggre-
gite, a giant statue of Buddha
seated in the lotus position,
open palm in lap, and par-
tially draped with a saphron
shawl and white lacings... Be-
fore the altar sat a variety of
candles which danced about
the Buddha‘s face. And theair
was filled with the smell of
incense and joss sticks (tree
mendous sticks ofincense held
by a Buddhist while praying
before the image of Buddha.

I was approached by a saph-
ron robed Buddhist monk and
we talked for a good while
(most monks are very well
educated, English being one
of their fortes). He invited
me to sleep in the temple that
night, an opportunity offered
in Buddhist temples through-
out Southeast Asia.

Endless Marvels

In the days to follow Chiengr
mai continued its endless
marvels and wonderful ease.
I‘d break out at the brink of
dawn, explore, dig the morn-
ing's freshness and its ability
to wake the drowsiest ofsouls,
and love every minute of it.
In no time, things fell into
place. The right smiles neur
tralized the ocassional heck-
ler, and the chirp of a bird
or the smell ofa lovely blosr
som always reminded me of
the vastly beautiful distance
from cement, smoke stacks,
and noise.

LATE SEPTEMBER

Crisp autumnal leaves
remind me

that some sunsets

follow their sunrises
more swiftly than others.

Rock Garden: The Contest For ‘Superslurdom’

by Ron Medvin

It’s that time ofyear again,
when the record companies try
to find a "superstar”. UNI
records was the winner last
year, when they recordeda guy
named Elton John. This year
it' s Warner Brothers, and
their potential superstar is a
guy named John Baldry.

“Long John”

John Baldry is related to
"Long John" Baldry. They
are the same person. Baldry
is net new to the musicworld:
he began singing folk songs in
England in 1961 and in ’64 he
was in the Hoochie Coochie
Men. Rod Stewart was the vo-
CAlist. He later (1966) joined
a group named Bluesology.
The pianist/organist was
named Reg Dwight, who later
changed his name and became
famous as Elton John.

Friends

So Baldry has been around.
And on his latest album, ”It
‘\ln't Easy", Baldry has not
forgotten his friends. (Or
should I say, his friends have-
n't forgotten him.) Side one of
the album lsprOdllCCdl‘YySEeW’
art and Side Two is produced
by John. With musicians such

The Scarlet and Black

as these-not to mention fan—
tastic back-up instrumenr
talists and vocalists-Baldry
can hardly lose.

But he comes far from
winning very much. Each song
on the first side sounds like
a Stewart imitation. His voice
closely resembles that of his
old partner, and the music
sounds like a lot of the blues
which Stewart sings, Not that
that's bad, of course, but I'd
rather hear Stewart than an
imitation.

Losers

His best song on the first
side is the title cut, “It Ain't
Easy", a song by Ray Davies.
It's a driving blues number
with some great guitar work
by Ron Wood~(Faces)r~and
steel guitar by Sam Mitchell.
The worst song is called
”Black Girl", a Huddie Leda
better number. The arrange-
ment is horrible, andhis voice
is too rough and gravely, and
often off-key. It‘s no match
for the original. Anether
loser is "Morning, Moriir
ing", aTuliKupfcrberg “hit".
(Remember the Fugs?) As if
the originslwasn'tbadenougli,
Baldry is here to remind us
how bad the song was.

It is not Rod Stewart's fault
that side one is weak, but

side two is a lot better. "Let’s
Burn Down the Cornfield"
(Randy Newman) is a slow
blues cut which ispretly good.
The piano in this song-mot to
mention all of the others on
side two-- is quiteprominent;
it is, of course, Elton John on
the keyboards.

”Mr. Rubin” is a Lesley
Duncan song, and it’s a very
beautiful soft ballad. Baldry
proves that he can sing quiet,
moving songs as well as the
harder rock numbers.

Guess what?

"Rock Me When He’s Gone"
is an Elton Johanernie Tau-
pin number, and guess what?
It sounds exactly like a Johnr
Taupin number. John plays
piano again, and there is no
mistaking his style. But it
is not one of his better songs,
although it would be much
better if he ltimsclfweresing-
ing it. Baldry’s imitation of

John is as unsuccessful ashis
attempt of imitating Stewart.
The last cut, strangely
enough, is by Rod Stewart. It's
produced by John and not
Stewart himself. It's called
"Flying”, and it's probably
the best song on the album.
It’s a seven‘minutehard’ rock
number complete with piano,
organ and vocal chorus - (with
girls suchas DorisTroy, Lesa
ley Duncan, and Madelene
Belll) The song builds in
intensity from beginning to end
and Baldry’s voice manages to
fit right in. He proves in this
one song that he is capable of
performing some very good
music; with or without a vocal
chorus!
Nominations

The "superstar hunting sea-
son” may justbe gettingunder
way, but it seems like Warner
Brothers is out of the racefor
the whil Baldry has poten*
tial, but this album does not
prove verymuch. Aperformer
cannot reach “superstar
dom", or even just recogni»
tion, by imitating two already
established superstars.
Nominations remain open for
the honorary superstar title.
Contest ends Dec. 31. Send
your choice to Box 717 before
October 221
