Ryan Directs Student Selection

by Mark Sableman

Grinnell's Office of Admisr
sions, headed by D. Nicholas
Ryan, Director of Admissions
and Financial Aid, is now ape
proximately midway through
its annual work, the selection
of the new students who will
come to Grinnell next year.
One hundred students have
already been accepted for ad
mission next year under the
early decision plan by which
applimnts apply before Jan"
uary l and agree to come to
Grinnell if accepted. In the
next three months, the ad-
mlSSlOnS staff and the Ad
missions Board, a faculty
committee, will select slud*
ents to fill the remainingthree
hundred places in the fresh-
man class.

Admissions decisions are
governed by an overall policy
set by a faculty student come
mittee, the Committee on Ad-
missions and Student Fin—
ancial Aid. That committee
does not review individualadr
missions cases. It delegates
this function in part to Ryan
and in part to a committee of
ﬁculty, the Admissions
Board, of which LaVerne
Durkee, associate professor
of biology, is chairman.

Present guidelines, as set
by the Admissions Commit-
tee, give Ryan the power to
accept or reject on the basis
of his judgement any applie
cant whose College Board ver-
bal aptitude scores fall be-
tween 550 and 650, or equiva-
lent ACT scores, and who is
in the upper one quarter of
his high school class.

Cases of applicants whohave
board scores below 550 and/or
a class rank.below the upper
quarter of their high school
class are always decided by
the Admissions Board. In
addition, no applicant who had
scores above 650 and rank in
the upper quarter of his class
can be refused admission
without the Admission Board’s
concurrence.

These standards do reﬂect in
large part the qualiﬁcations of
the students who apply to the
college -- Grinnell, like other
colleges and universities,will
take the best that the market
will allow them to take. Some
ACM colleges top out at 700
applications each year, while
one, Colorado College, gets
up to 3000 applications. Grins
nelI is in a middle position
here ~ this year itwillselect
400 to 410 new students from
a pool of 1300 applicants.

It is in the selection of stud-
ents from the sub-550 board
score group that most of the
guess work enters the selec-
tion process. The Admissions
Committee has setup nopolicy
on this group, or on applicants
in this group from disadvantr
aged areas ,, for example
ghetto areas and very small
rural areas, prefering to have

the Admissions Board look
over each case individually.
In the cases of applicants
whose board scores and class
rank are inconsistent —- they
either fall below 550 on the
college board or the top quar-
ter of their class while other‘
wise showing good achieve-
ment or aptitude--the Admisr
sions Board relies heavily on
personal recommendations.
Unfortunately, Ryan pointed
out, many counseling staffs in
high schools never get the op
portunity to lcnow the student
well, and the recommendation
of the secondary school is
often of little help to the Ad
missions Board.

The admission board’s deci-
sions on students from dis-
advantaged schools -- parti-
cularly ghetto schools -- is
also based on recommenda‘
tions and other reports, such
as the personal interview, in
an attempt to overcome the
cultural bias of the SAT and
ACT aptitude tests,and deter-
mine how well a student will
actually perform at Grinnell.
Apparently, Grinnell will
have more black students in
the coming year's freshman
class, although the competie
tive situation among colleges
and universities for black
students prevents any great
increases. Charles Guy,black
admissions counselor, spent
the fall travelling to highsch-
ools and talking to potential
applicants. In addition, he is
working with CBS to have a
special weekend to introduce
Grinnell to black students
from Iowa. There are now
only two black students from
Iowa, there were none last
year. CBS has also just writ-
ten a brochure called “Black
Expressions" 'for blacks in- ,
terested in Grinnell, designed
to tell them, from the student's
standpoint, what to expect.
Recently there has been a
great deal of comment and crie
ticism of what many see as a
trend away from diversity in
the student body, particularly
as more and more students
come from urban areas. Ryan
and his staff have been making
efforts to counteract Grin—
n611's declining enrollment of
students from Iowa. last
week, an Iowa college schol-
arship was instituted, with the
primary intent of indicating
to Iowa high schools and stud-
ents that Grinnell was thinking
of them.

The effort, however, may
not be enough alone to reverse
the "big city trend‘ﬂ The so-
called "Iowa problem" is
greater than many would be-
lieve. in 1959, more than thirty
percent of the student body
was from Iowa. Four years
ago, in the 196667 school
year, more than twenty per-
cent of the students were from
Iowa. This year, it is twelve
percent over all, and less than
ten percent in the freshman

class.
Two years ago, Arnold Adele

berg, associate professor of
mathematics and a member of
the Admissions Committee
found a high correlation be-
tween those applicants who
were interviewedﬁspecially if
the interview was on campus,
and those who were offered
admission and accepted the
offer. In the l968-69applicant
class, 43% of those enrolled
were not interviewed prior to
decision, as compared with
67% of those who were offered
admission but withdrew, and
95% of those who were denied
admission. As a result of this
finding, the Admissions Office
has been trying harder to
bring applicants to campus for
an interview, or to have the
applimnt interviewed at his
home.

The data for last year's group
of applicants revealedseveral
other possiblymore important
trends. This year's freshman
class, for example, has a
malerfemale ratio of46%male
to 54% female. The ratio was
50*50 the previous year and
historically there have been
more than 50%rmalel

Finally, both aptitude and
achievement test score aver—
ages were down an average of
five to fifteen points in last
year's freshman class from
the previous class. At least
part of the change in aptitude
test scores is due to a change
to a more realisticway ofsel-
ecting data, but the decrease
in achievement test scores is
probably almost entirely due
to the increased size of last
year's freshman class.

Commenting on this trend in
his report to the Admissions
Committee, Adelberg wrote,
"The assumption that wehave
managed to obtain an unusually
large freshman class with no
loss of quality is suspect."
He urged that any further
expansions of the student body
be accompanied byattempts to

'expand the pool of qualified

applicants. Dean Waldo Wal-
ker, chairman of the Admisr
sions Committee, toldtheS&B
that he believes the meaning
of the five to ten point decline
in achievement test scores is
“low, if signifian at all."
He emphasized that it is the
non-objective factors, and not
the test scoresand class rank,

- which weigh most heavily in

the selection process.

The data from last year’s
applicant class shows an ex-
tremely high correlation be-
tween thoseapplicants whoare
offered admission to Grinnell
and. SAT verbal aptitude
scores of approximately 550
and greater. More than 80% of
those applicants offered ads
mission had scores of ap-
proximately 550 or greater,
and 55% of those denied ad~
mission had scores of less
than ssu. Only 10% of those
denied admission had scores
greater than 650, and many of
these applicants may have had
low class ranks. Overall, it
appears that approximately
85% of applicants with scores
greater than 550 were offered
admission, and approximately
60% of those with scores less
than 550 were offered admis
sion. Twenty per cent of the
enrolled freshmen have
scores of less than 550.

it is, of course, eXtremely
difficult to determine what if
any is the meaning of this
so-called ”objective data".
Usually, this data is not the

prime consideration for the
admissions office or the ads
missions board, and it is us
ually only considered signifie
cant when judged along with
other objective data, and the
”nonsobjective" factors. The
admissions committee may
try to evaluate its significance
through the use of a special
College BoardEvaluationser-
vice, or through its ownanaly‘
sis, but it has not as yet as,
cided whether or not to do so.
This year, the Admissions
Office will send out alongwith
acceptances to applicants, of-
fers of what will total more
than $200,000 in financial aid.
Normally, fifty percent of
the years' applicants will say
on their application form that
