UNFAIR !!!!!

On April 7 last year Dean of Women Evelyn Gardner
told the current editor of the S&B “Sixty percent of the
students don’t need a cut rule. I would estimate that only
fifteen percent of the students would have their grades
affected by the number of cuts they took. A cut system
such as the present one is for the minority. My personal
preference is for a less precise system."

Yesterday the Personnel Board of which Miss Gardner
is chairman decided that 90% of the student body needs
such a cut system. There is a strange'and disheartening

incongruity here.

_ The cut system as it now stands is unrealistic, un-
fair and actually detrimental.

1. It is an unrealistic rule because it was shown by a
survey of students on the Dean’s List the first semester of
last year that no correlation existed between number of
cuts taken and grade point average achieved. We contend
that if an experiment could be conducted in which above
average upperclassmen were given unlimited cuts for a
semester it would be found that there is slight, or no cor-
relation between number of absences and grade point aver-
age.

2. It is an unfair rule because there are many sober,
mature, conscientious students who work to their full ca-
pacity yet simply cannot and never will be able to make
beyond a 3. or 2.5 average, simply because that is their
capacity. These students work as hard or harder as those
in the upper 10% of the college; why should they be re-
fused unlimited cuts? The rule is also unfair to those stu~
dents who contribute a meat portion of their time and
energy to the college community, In cases where before
taking on heavy obligations to the community these stu-
dents were on dean’s list, they are actually being penalized
for their contribution to the community,

3. That the present cut rule is actually detrimental
to the student body can he proved by showing the benefits
of a less stringent cut rule, These are:

a. By presupposing maturity and individual responsi-
bility we can encourage those qualities. By refusing an out-
let for these qualities we stymie their growth,

b. an unlimited or relaxed cut system would encourage
the faculty to perform at their highest level. If their lec-
tures or discussion groups were below par, they would find
themselves faced with an empty class room. If their lecv
tures or discussion groups were above par—if they were
interesting, stimulating, and exciting as learning processes
should be~they would find students thronging to their
classes. Initiative is insufficient; stimulus is necessary, As
the convocation speakers of this year have so frequently
commented; there is no stimulus in speaking to an audience
who is there because they have to be; there is all the
stimulus in the world speaking to an audience which has
come to hear by choice. We feel sure that the better pro-
fessors on campus would welcome this challenge with
enthusiasm, and the drifters would be forced to take if
up or admit defeat in their chosen profession.

c. A less stringent system would cull the wheat Irom
the chaff academically speaking. It would reveal which stu-
dents are in college for an education, and which are here
to prolong adolescence, find a husband, or dodge the draft.

This brings us to the strange and deeply discouraging
lncongruity noted at the beginning. Let’s face it. Grinnell
keeps the unrealistic, unfair, and detrimental cut rule it
now has because it can‘t afford to lose the “chaff” element
of the student body since it still is fighting a low enroll-
ment and trying to keep its head above the financial
waters. An unlimited cut rule would be downright fatal
to the school at this point because under such a rule “the
chaf " would show their colors, and the school would have
show them to the door. However the number of college-age
students steadily increases. By 1960 the onslaught will
be on, and Grinnell will be able to select the cream of the
crop and function accordingly. The ideal and real in aca»
demic policy will reach an equilibrium, and we hope, fuse.

But until then, can’t We try ,to come closer to the
ideal? If a greater number of students are able to achieve
a 3.5 average, give them and the school credit! Give them
unlimited cuts, instead of raising the standard for unlimit-
ed cuts to 3.6. If the percentage of students capable of
doing high quality work is unusually good, publicize it in-
stead of hiding it!

The Sound

This time we

Campus Archetypes. It may
seem that the need rm- Castl—

that leaves around 160 students

clay another election will be
held. there's no reason wl the
turn out should not hc upwards
of 95%.

The Campus Intellectual: This
type is not to be confused with
the campus Sophisticate. This
person loves books and ideas to
such an extent that he is m—
capable of pDSltive action. He
pops into your room at 4:30 m
the morning, saying, ”I must
see your Eliot." He then ponr
tiers over “The Waste Land” for
a few minutes and finally re-
marks, “Ah ha A new concept.
Even Auden missed this palm."
immensely satisfleld, he leaves.
When this type leaves school,
he will join with others of the
same type in forming a small
clique which dines together on
Tuesday nights and discovers
other points which ”even Duden"
missed. This man’s sin far ex-
ceeds many others It definitely
exceeds the pseudodntellectua],
whose amlcs are the same, be-
cause this person betrays the
gift of a fine mind, HIS intelli-
genee could no doubt be a force,
but u never escapes Lhe bondA
age of self-established exile.

The Campus Jim Thorpe:
This man is not to be confused
with an athlete. Many persons
indulge in athletics and are
able to keep them in their pro-
per perspective. Not so with
this person. His reading is con-
fined to the sports page and
such articles as “Could Rocky
Marciano Have Licked Jess
Willard," His sole topic of con-
versation is athletics. His single
criterion for a candidate is
"How good an athlete is he?”
Nothing else is important.

The Campus Student: You
may not recognize this one. He
is a very rare type, but he does
exist. He is only interested in
his chosen field, tol- example
economics. He takes, on the av-
erage, three econ courses per
semester. The other courses are
requirements and as little dis-
tribution as the law will allow.
He thinks Shakespeare was born
in France and Dickens wrote
“War and Peace." He studies
night and day. He doesn't go
to campus functions, he wouldn’t
even know the college was
cured if there weren‘t girls in
his classes, and to him, south
campus is a geographical no
tion. He would vote in these
elections but he doesn't know
whose running, 50 he stays
home and studies.

We probably could go on with
these, but there seems little
point in it. The point to be
made should be made by now,
These are the people who don‘t
vote. They are like the moon,
you see only a single side. If
any other fact exists you are
not aware of it But to over-

3.6 As Average

Dean's List mark for this 5&7
mester is 3.5 or higher, Homer
Norton, Dean or the Collegc, an-
nounced last night,

The grade pain: represents
less than the top ten percent,
Norton said. Although “the gen-
eral aim is the top ten percent”
of the students, Norton called
gomg to two decimal places
under a letterrgradlng system “a
little absurb.” The figure of 3.6
was requested of Dean Nocmr
by the Personnel Board, ThursV
day afternoon.

There are about 70 or so
students on Dean’s List this se~
mester, Numb estimated.

many Gl'lnrlell students would

Countryman, who has made it

Barr. "Well, its guys like that

Barr sensed a futility in furth-
