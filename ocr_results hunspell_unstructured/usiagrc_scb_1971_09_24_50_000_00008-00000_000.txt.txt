_Pioneers Drown

Well, what can Isay? The
game was wet, sloppy, cold,
and I dug it a bunch.

It was the first Grinnell Col-
lege football game [had ever
seen and I did not know what
to expect. Evidently neither
did Monmouth or Grinnell,
since the first ten minutes
were marred by stupid mis-
takes, fumbles, intercepted
passes, and general messing
around. It never did get any
better.

Most of the high points of
the game were in the stands.
The cheerleaders were enthu-
slastic and the ObSquad was
in great voice. The first of
many high points in the game
was the razzing of the kicker
with his white shoes. Another
high point of the gme was
the announcer being totally
broken up in giggles at the
start of the second half. The
highest point of all was the
passing around of a strange
smelling weed.

Monmouth scored the first
touchdown while everyone's
attention was caught by the
(koss Country runners cap-
turing the first seven places

in their meet..But the touch-_

down was scored only after
a courageous goal line stand
by Grinnell’s defense; the
point after was missed.

At halftime we were enter-
tained by a medley of NFL
fight songs. For those who
couldn't take that, several.
members of the Oh Squad put
on a half time show of spon-
mneous touch football.

The second half began with
the Pioneers kicking off. Af-
ter that there was muchﬂoun-
dering with neither team being
able to put any kind of drive
together. Finally, in the fou-
rth quarter, Grinnelllseemed
to be moving. Our troops had
a first and goal, and it 1007
ked good for us. However,
it only looked that way. Four
plays later the Pioneers lost
the ball to the Scots and that
was effectively the end of the
pine.

Before it was over Monmouth
scored another touchdown
which, with the point after
made the final score 13—0.
With only thirtys eight seconds
left there was a misunder-
standing on the field and the
game was called because of
a riot.

I was quite impressed with
the passing game of Grinnell.
If the Pioneers can develop
a consistent running attack,
they might yet be in a posis
tion to challenge St. Olaf.

Soccer Team Does It

by John Hinde

A small group of Grinnell
students, commonly known as
the soccer team, made a long

‘and heroic journey to that
dangerous metropolisu Cedar
Rapids. The purpose of this
odyssey was to engage in ath—
letic combat with the Coe
College contingent.

, Our brave little band, often
withsnanding not only the mi-
ghty onslaught of the One kis
cker, but also the inherentev-
ils available in cities larger
than Grinnell, returned with
a victory under dieir belts.

Even Contest
The score of this battle was
Grinnell 5, Coe 2. However
it must be said that the score
doe not tell the full story of
the game. An even contest

with Grinnell sitting ona 1-0
lead at its end. The second
half belonged to Grinnell. Wh-
ile the Grinnell defense limi-
ted Coe to two goals, the
offense proceeded to put the
ball in the net four times.

The star of the game was
Steve Korstad, who helped give
the team their winningmargin
by scoring three goals. Other
goals were contributedby Levi
Wood and Tom Lincoln.

Future Games

Next Saturday Knox College

roughest games of the soccer
season. Come to the soccer
field and see this game. It
will be well worth the time
and effort.

ﬂ Female Field Hockey Starts

As I was jogging my deep
and merrie way to North Cams
pus I happened upon two fair
maids of Grinnell, engaged in
the pursuit of a small white
ball With some sticks. Quoth
I, “What are you doing?”
Quoth they, ”Field Hockey,
of course."

Thus began my contact with
the Woman’s Field Hockey
team which is located here on
campus. This smallrbut de-
dicated band of Females works
out Tuesday, Thursday and
Friday nights from 4:00 to
about 5:15 on the field in
front of Cowles. The fair
maids with whom ispoke were
Kathi Ellis and Mary Jane
Elam, both longtime members
of the team. In an on the

' field interview they gave me

some very candid thoughts
about the student attitude to-
ward s field hockey at Grins
nell, which is one of reali-
tive non-interest. Why? Kathi
said that it was because for-
merly the games were played
behind Younker Health Center,
and that noone was able to
walk out that far to watch
them play. However, she says
that the team is in high hopes
that this situation will be chans
ged because of the new play
ing location, which is the prev
viously mentioned Cowles
field.

Thursday’s game wasagainst
the University of Iowa. This
is the only home game to be
played by this band of intres
pid females. Twoother games
are scheduled for uctober 9
at Iowa State University and
October 16 at the University
of Northern Iowa. A tourna-
ment is also in the works,
but at time of writing no
further information wasavail-
able except that it ‘would dee

finitely be held after the mid-
semester break.

The Grinnell field hockey
team consists of anywheres
from lS-ZSplayers, depending
upon the weather, tests, what's
going on and other factors
of a various and sundry nature.
The team is headed by Laura
David who urges all interest
ed parties to come down and
play a few games.

Ju-Jitsu

by Lee

Greetings Sports Fans -

The Japanese art of self d5.
fense, Ju-Jitsu has come to
Grinnell in the form of Ed
Hirsch. Why do I say "...in
the form of Ed Hirsch?” Be‘
cause Ed is the highest belt
holder on campus who is also
qualified to teach Ju-Jitsu.
Jusjitsu is handwrrhand
combat which is based on a
system of set manuevers that
force an opponent to use his
weight and strength against
himself.

Ed, a freshman, has been
interested in Ju-Jitsu for ab-
out a year. He holds a blue
belt, which is the second of
four belts, the hightest being

the coveted black belt.
What started as a call for

a partner to work out with
has snowballed into a full*
ﬂedged class offering aca-
demic credit. Ed said that he
was rather surprised to find
that 18 people were lnleI‘ES’
ted in participating in a class
of this nature. He emphasized
that the class is open to any
and all who are interested in
learning the techniques of
self-defense. Meeting times
are 7:30 a 9:00, M, T, TH,
F, evenings in the wrestling
room at the new P.E. comp-
lex. Tentative date for the
class is October 4.

(ca Cringes As
Spikers Strike

Scott Weil is determined to
leave his mark on this year's
cross country team. Already
he has left his mark on Coach
Obermiller’s dress shirt with
his water pistol. But, since it
was Scott's birthday Tuesday,
and since he is still a young
boy, Coach Obermilier lethim
off the hook with the punish-
ment of running only fifty
miles.

In the election for a team
captain, Chuck McGrath re
ceived all but two of the
votes. It was a landslide vice
tory. Scott Well and "Speedy"
Bruce Morrison each received
one of the remaining votes.
Despite the fact that he voted
for himself, Scott promptly
decided that Chuck had stufe
fed the ballot box, and now
refers to Chuck and himself
as “ctrcaptains.”

Even though riddled by intrar
team squabbles, the Pioneers
settled down to business at,
last Saturday'smeet. Coe Cole
lege and William Penn may
have wished they had stayed
home, like Monmouth, because
Grinnell grabbed the first
eight places.

The star of the day was Dan
Hildebrand who came in se-
cond place, leading a group
of three freshmen, Robert
Tennen, John Hersberg and
Terry Seeberger, to four of
the top five places. Once age
ain, Grinnell was missing a
few of its top runners, due
to injuries and Other miscels
laneous causes. If Grinnell's
team is healthy at the time of
the conference meet, the other
teams may as well not show
up. They might find them—
selves trampled.
