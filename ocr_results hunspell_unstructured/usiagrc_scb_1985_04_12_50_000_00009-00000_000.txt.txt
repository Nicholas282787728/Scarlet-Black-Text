SEA Takes more Direct Action

ll_\ l‘lllllill Cohen and Friend

A new chapter in the history at
students to End Apartheid has been
opened this semester. For over a
decade SEA has been opposing the
r t regime in South Atrica by
pressuring the college to divest itself
ircnl companies that have holdings in
South Africa. The SEA is now adding a
new direction in the form of the Direct
Action Group (SEA-DAG). SEA~DAG is
committed to directly assisting the
resistance movements in South Africa
This task is most easily accomplished
by educating Americans on the
giievences and programs of the
resistance movement and by supplying
tllonetary support.

After much consideration. SEA-DAG
decided to concentrate its efforts on
support of the Azanian People's
Organization tAZAPO). AZAPO is

much smaller than the African Na-
tional Congress or the United
Democratic Front and subsequently
has a smaller resource pool. Grinnell's
contribution to this organization will
therefore be more significant.

AZAPO is also appealing because it is
a grassroots and community oriented
organization. it is a non-violent all»
black organization with much of its eta
lorls directed at improving health and
educational facilities in local areas. A
recent politicaltdrive (which needed
outside funding) was aimed at
educating blacks on the implications of
the new constitution. More recently
AZAPO was in the US. news as its sup~
porters boycotted the tour of Senator
Edward Kennedy AZAPO feels that his
presence merely lent credibility to the
Nationalist regime,
