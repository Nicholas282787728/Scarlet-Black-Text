TEAM m GOOD SHAPE FOR
TUSSLE WITH CREIGBIEDN.

Defeat of Ames Strengthens ‘Pioucers’
Conﬁdence in Spite of Opponents
Good Record.

With the end of one of the stiltest
gridiron schedules in the history of
the school in sight, Coach Hylands
warriors ar‘e preparing for the final
game of the season with Creighton
university at Omaha next Saturday.

The team emerged from the tussle
with Amos in good shape, pins the
confidence.that they are among the
best teams in the Valley, and are
working hard to make the season a
success by decisively defeating the
Nebraskans, and reve'nging themselves
for‘the 14 to o defeat handed them by
Creighton last year

Creighton hanks High

Neither coaches nor team, however,
are under—rating the Creighton team,
for the Omaha school has one of the
best football aggregations in the west
this year, and have a noteworthy
record of triumphs, Their outstand—
ing victory of the season was the de»
feat of Marquette, 20 'to 0, after the

‘Milwaukee institution trounced the

Navy earlier in the season, Last week
Creighton fought the Oklahoma As~
gies to a it to 2o tie, and the Aggies
have a team that is as good as the best
in the Valley this year.

Good Running Ati'ilick.

Lower, halfback, is the offensive
star of the Creighton team, and he
was responsible for two of the three
touchdowns histoam made against the
Aggies. The team is unusually heavy
and has a powerful running attack,
specializing in end runs and off—tackle
plays. Their passing game is not
supposed to be as good, but their run—
hing offense has been so effective that
they have not had much necessity to
resort to the forward pass.

The game will by no means he an
easy one despite the recent successes
ot the Pioneers, and Coaches Hyland
and Black have been sparing no effort
to produce a team strong enough to
add Creighton to the list or Grinnell
victories.

Pep Bubbles Over
At Varsity‘Dinner

Makes Grnydiended Honioconters Re
luclnlter “The Good Old Days.”
i

"Even if we didn’t snatch the long

end of the score, we won a great more
al vctory." Familiar as that ancient
slogan may sound to Griunellians, it's
about the only statement that wasn’t
made at the varsity dinner at the
Quadrangle Saturday evening after the
Ames-Grinnell some.

The crowded dining room‘ bubbled
over with hilarious enthusiasm, speak-
ers waxed fervent and held forth from
astounding heights of eloquence, and
nobody gave a hang how long the
thing lasted. So many people felt
the urge to celebrate with the team
and the homecomcrs that numbers had
to wait for the “second table."

Gray-headed homecomers settled
back in their chairs and beamed hen—
evolently; and a wild rumor is afloat
to the eff/Oct that a few were com-
pletely carried away by the spirit of
victor-y;~that. in the exuberance of
the moment they so far forgot ihcm—
selves as to admit that the college is
just as good as it used to he back in
the good old days.

Freshman Teams Put
Up Hard, Close Game

Dodging tachlers for thirty yards on

Black team, scored the only counter oi'
the game between the two freshman
teams, played on the practice field Sat.

tie from start to finish.

'in the drst half the teams battled in

the slight advantage. 'Neither goal

both teams made sonic nice gains. 1n
the second half, early in the fourth
quarter,1dvahn captured a Blue punt
and raced across the goal and a min—

composed of Wolfe, Schoeneman,
nooks and Evahn, displayed a stellar
brand of open field running and re—

Spencer, who was shifted from tackle
to fullback for the Blues, showed good
offensive work and with Bradbury,
quarterback, formed the nucleus of
the offense. Davis, captain of the
Blue team, stopped play after play for
the opposing team and was a bulwark
of strength on the offense. ‘

The lineup was, for the Blues: Cohen

Davis, tackles; Belding and Selle,

Homecoming VlsltOl S
Tell “HOW It Feels”

Last Saturday, a Scarlet and Elilck
reporter questioned several members
,of the Homecoming crowd as to their
impressions of Grinneil. The axis
wers which he received might be sumo
med up in this reply, “I’ll sign my
‘nillnC to anything good you, want 10
,say about the r nool."

Mr. Authier, President of the Press
Club of Washington D. C.: “This is my
first visit to Grinncll in twenty years.
I planned to leave town right alter the
game, but I'm having such a good
timoithat I‘ve decided to stay over."

William King, '9 , of Webster City,
“That pep meeting the other night was

‘bunch of fellows here that i ever met,”

F. B. Schoaucnian or H ,vtll'dcu, the

cd States."

l-T have been very interested in the
“publicity which various papers
lthroughout the state have been giving
to our school 1 am sure that it is
all deserved." >

Hoyt Thompson, '01, of Rock Itap-
ids, "I certainly enjoy watching this
fi shman football game. We didn’t
have anydhing like this when i was in
school."

D W. D. Long of Mason City, rather
of two students, "I like the democratic,
connnnnlty atmosphere which per-
meates all the activities here. The

' students seem well organized to take

care of themselves."

Robert McCoi-nack, '20, of Sioux
City, "There was a time when we
[couldn't expect winning teams from
lGrinnell but things have changed ma-
torially now. The pep meeting last
night made me realize this fact more
than ever."

Merely :t Rumor

N. B. The above interviewing was
done before the game. The Scarlet
and Black regrets that after the game
,was over Saturday afternoon it was
iimpossible for a reporter to hang on
lto on illumnus’ coat tail long enough
to put the necessary questions, How‘r
,ever, a vague rumor was illiring about
the campus Saturday night, to the ef—
fect that alumni and visito in gen—
eral were not definitely displeased
with the final outcome of the 1924
Homecoming.

The Pioneers overcame a jinx of
many years standing last Saturday
when they staged a desperate second
hall rally and nosed out the Cyclones
14 to 13,

The powerful Ames eleven had v-is—
ions or a walkaw—ay , and a practice
game when it ran rough shod through
Hyland's team for two touchdowns in
the ﬁrst quarter, 0n the second play
J, Eehm rah thirty yards to the Gri -
neil seven-yard line from where Wi . .
gel-t smashed over and a few minutes
later Willaman's men registered again
via the aerial route. Not dismayed by
the early lead, the nerceness of be
attack which the Scarlet and Black
unleashed swept the Aggies off their
feet and brought two touchdowns, one
in the third quarter; and the other in
the fourth. .

Sweet and Moran Slur

Although the entire Pioneer eleven
played wonderful ball after it ever-
came the "buck fever," Meredith
Sweet and "an" Moran deserve spec—
ial mention for the brilliant exhib»
tion they put on for the Homecoming
throng. Sweet was a ground ‘gaining
demon that the Cyclones could not
stop. None of his gains were long but
on almost every attempt he went from
three to ten yards. Moran also sifted
through the Aggie forward wall for
considerable yardage in addition to
passing, puntrng and place kicking‘in
great fashion.

Coach 'Willaman's gridsters went
down to defeat but not without show-
ing the Pioneers the prettiest forward
passing machine that has been on
Ward Field for many years. With
Roberts doing the hurling and Nave,
Doe and the Eehm brothers on the re-
ceiving ends the aerial attack of the
larva State team was a rare sight and
a terror to the Grinnell eleven, espec-
ially in the ilrst half. Johnny Behm
thrilled the crowd with some long open
field runs that almost resulted in
touchdowns. ‘

Pioneers Rally

The reports of the two halves of the
contest read like different games. in
the first two quarters Amos gained
159 yards and made seven first downs
while the Pioneers were being held at
a standstill. The tables were reversed
in the last priod and the Cyclones
made only sixteen yards and failed to
make a ﬁrst down while the Scarlet
and Black was adding up yards and
ﬁrst downs in rapid fashion.

The Pioneers took advantage of the
only break in the game, in the third
quarter. Johnny Bebm fumbled a punt
on his ﬁfteen yard line and Grinneil,
recovered. Swet ploughed off tackle
to within three yards of the goal line
,and from there. after two attempts,
the ball was carried over by Moran.
He place kicked for the extra point.

l Tliylitr Glitches Senslltlmml Puss

Late in the fourth quarter with the
Cyclones still leading Morgan Taylor
was sent in to do the impossible. With
the ball in midfield the Olympic cham-
vpion tore down the field so yards to
iget under Moran's perfect pass. Tay~
;lor was covered, by three men but he
jumped from their midst, hlgh in the
,air and brought down the pigskin on
the fifteen yard line. with the
ball within scoring distance it

was Meredith Sweet who was
called upon to put it over In two
attempts he went to the two yard line,
the next trial was a short gain, but
Amos was offside and it was ﬁrsl‘:
