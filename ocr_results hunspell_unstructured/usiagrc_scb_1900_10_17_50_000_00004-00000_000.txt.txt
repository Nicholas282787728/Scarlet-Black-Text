Where We Are At.

With the Minnesota game at
Minneapolis next Saturday begins
a series oi ﬁve gamesithe hard-
est by all odds a Grinnell team
has ever tackled. Wisconsin at
Madison, October 2 Ames at
Grinnell, November 3; Nebraska
at Lincoln, November lo, and last
but not least, before the Thanks»
giving contest with Drake, Iowa
at Iowa City, Novcmbet l7. Com-
plete the quintettc. And it will
certainly afford the eleven all the
entertainment it wants for one sea-
son. It is in accordance with
Grinnoll luck that, having ar-
ranged as heavy a schedule as an
Iowa team ever encounter-ed, we
should have the lightest teanl that
ever represented any oi tlle “Big
Four." ThattheMinnesotagame
will tax the endurance of the team
to the utmost there can be no
doubt. However. the men promr
ise to put up a game that will in
every way be superior to that
played against Cornell.

Baggs is playing specially well
on the defensive. though still
erratic in passing. Howell im~
proves every day, while Lewis has
still much to learn in aggressive-
ness. Fellows and Zeigler are do
ing for light men at tackle, but
neither has yet shown the lite and
dash Grinncll expects in her ath-
letes. The worries of leadership
seem to have bothered Captain
Douglas very little, but Chase.
partially owing to illness, has not
been up to the usual standard on
the leit wing. Dignan and King
are making a ﬁght for that place
also. Fisk: continues steady and
reliable at quarter. and is far su-
perior to his ’99 form in the mat-
ter of aggressiveness. Foster.
Lyman and D. Evans have the call
on half-back positions at present.

 

All are hard, willing workers, but
still lack conﬁdence in themselves.
Clark is the best punter Grinnell
has had in years and has also been
hitting the line in ﬁne form. How-
ever, he gives up too easily when
blocked or tackled. McKeag.
Swan, VVelker, Vail Dike, H.
Clark and M. Smith have all
rendered valiant service on the
scrub. The men seem to he in
ﬁne tettle and for the beneﬁt of
those who have made sport of
our “hard luck" stories it might
be added that Grinnell still thinks
it has the best conditioned eleven
in Iowa.

Dinner to‘Dr. Sanders.

During his short stay in Chi-
cago it was the pleasure of several
ot our Chicago Alumni to meet
the presidentselect at an inlormal
dinner arranged for him VVednesr
day evening at the Union League
Club. :There were present at the
dinner Messrs Austin, Kennedy.
G. L. Marsh, Darling, Williston.
Cravath, Miss Katherine Jones.
Mr. and Mrs. Pringle, Mr. and
Mrs. Cattell.

Dr. Sanders created a very
favorable impression by his {rank
discussion of the situation and the
possibilities of his taking the exe-
cutive chair. During the course
of the dinner the relationship of
the Chicago Association to the
President was freely discussed,
the speakers referring ieelingly to
the warm attachment for Presi-
dent Gates and the hearty support

the Association had accorded him.
Dr. Sanders expressed the hope
that in the event of his taking the
President's chair. that he would
enjoy that loyalty and affection
which the alumni have always
borne President Gates.

The dinner though hastily ar-
ranged and informal was greatly
enjoyed and it is possible on Dr.
Sanders return a larger gathering
may be arranged.
