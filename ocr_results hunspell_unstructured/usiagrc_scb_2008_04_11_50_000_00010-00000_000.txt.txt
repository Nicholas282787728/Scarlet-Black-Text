Naming names in the 5&3

Last week we ran an article reporting that the
Grinncll Police Depnrznrcnr had issued an arrest
warrant for a Grinnell student and in so doing pub-
lished the name ofthat student.

Since then, many ofus [rave been asked and even
clnllenged about our decision
to print the name of the per
son in question.

Thc questlon is certainly
relevant and important. This
years issues have included a
number of articles on sensi—
tive matters and incriminatr
ing information in the pub
lic domain that can damage
a person’s future in the professional and personal
spheres.

As the primary source of news on campus, we
are responsible for informing the community at
large about issues affecting it and to do so as well as
possible. Arbitrarily censoring the news always has
the prospect of distorting the issue at hand.

Furthermore, the names in question are often
already public knowledge.

Following the vandalism several weeks ago, the
Gr-innell Police Department issued a press release
and the Grinnell Heraldskegisrer published an artis
cle, both ofwhich included the names ot'individual

but in

about student rs and drug usc.

This respons' ry to publish intormarion as frilly
and accurately as possible goes beyond abstract corn-
mitments and slogans.

On it campus so small that most everyone knows

The case nfthe vandalism
in Harries was no exception,
as many specullttediand
continue to spoculdtbas to
some of the incident’s ﬁner
details; some otthese rumors
even dangerously implicated
other individuals. The best
way to quell such rumors is to print the truth.

That said, we recognize that in such a small and
tightly knit community, what we print has the potens
tial to either lionize or tarnish a person's reputation on
campus. We have a responsibility to act respectfully
toward fellow Grinnellians.

The SE53 is not a gossip rag, and we do not print
names when the personal cost ofrlorng so is high and
the informative value negligible.

In an article earlier this semester, the names of
two srudcnrs who were rcmor-cd from campus for

Outdoor dining long overdue

Wirli the dining hall settling into its fourth see
mester of use, many of the bugs that plagued both
dining hall cmployees and patrons have been ham-
mered out. The sandwich line has a toaster, the milk
machine is consistently rcsrocked and the ice cream
even has a few more ﬂavor options. r

But still, one main attraction that the new {as
cility initially boasted has yet to be implemented—
what has become of the promised olltdoor dining?

As the weather is supposed to/has gotten warmer,
the patio space outside the dining hall remains nns
usedfl‘bc doors to the patio are apparently alarmed.
which doesn't exactly bode well for the supposed fu-
ture of outdoor dining.

Assuming that the doors will be opened, tables
and chairs bought, all we’re saying is—vveather per—

be nice to enioy that lake style ziti or chocolate ice
