Eysenbach’s

pr0posa| bypasses
student input

Dean Eysenbach gets “no credit" for her handling of her
Academic Standing proposal to reinstate the ‘D' grade in the
grading system, Recently, the Committee on Academic
Standing approved the proposal and Eysenbach proceeded
to write it up.

After reestablishing the ‘D,’ the proposal recommends
that plus and minus gradations also be added to the grading
code.

In response to numerous faculty discussions about the
grading system, Eysenbach took a straw poll of the faculty
at the end of last semesterl Finding strong support for the
use of a ‘D’ grade, the dean initiated discussions in Com
mittee on Academic Standing meetings about a change in
the grade code. A few weeks ago, the committee voted to
recommend the use of the ‘D' grade to the faculty. To become
policy, the proposal would have to be approved by a majority
of the faculty. However, before giving it to the faculty,
Eysenbach sent the proposal to the Curriculum Committee
for consideration. This committee has jurisdiction because
some of the proposed changes would affect graduation
requirements, which are the duty of the committee.

Only when the curriculum committee chairman sent the
proposal to committee members for pre-meeting study on
Tuesday were any students aware of the proposal. However,
committee members beat the president of the college to
reading the proposal. Turner did not‘read the proposal until
mid-day Wednesday.

Two serious questions arise. When, if ever, was student
opinion considered in formulating the proposal which affects

‘.our grades? And, should this proposal be adopted by the
faculty?

According to Eysenbach, the Institutional Self-Study
Survey was available to indicate student opinion.
Arnold Adelberg and Victor Verrette, faculty Academic
Standing Committee members, denied the use of the survey
as a source of student opinion or any consideration at all of
student opinion. Several committee members said student
opinion should have been considered.

Grading changes demand consideration of student
opinion. Grades are a crucial part of the academic process
which affects students for the rest of their lives.

Students should not be reacting now to the specifics of a
proposal already formalized. We, the student body, should
have been involved in the initial policy discussions. At the
very least, we should have been allowed to answer a straw
poll such as the one distributed to the faculty.

Such handling of the proposal only increases students’
distrust of Eysenbach, as well as tainting the administration
and faculty. The course of this proposal dangerously
resembles the way the recent off-campus housing and Saga
decisions were made—without students

But before the final decision is made without us, we need
to discuss widely the proposal in the college community,
beyond the limited representation of the curriculum com-
mittee.

Though now forced to react to a specific proposal, we must
have an opportunity to discuss the proposed change and
grades in general among ourselves, with faculty and ad-
ministrators.

Questions immediately arise about the present proposal.
What was each committee member‘s rationale in voting for
the proposal? The rationale set forth in the written proposal
is that the reintroduction of the ‘D' will restore the ‘C' as a
legitimate grade. However, several committee members said
that they favored the ‘D’ because it allows students to
receive credit for a lower quality of work. Are there other
rationales? Was the proposal an attempt to curb grade in-
flation'l

Additional questions arise about grading systems in
general. How will changes affect grad school interpretation
of a Grinnell student's performance? What about passrfail
options? How many gradations are useful? What are the pros
and cons of a crediterase system versus the pros and cons of
one with an “F" option?

Only through the discussion of these and other issues, by
the entire campus community, is there a possibility for a
decision that is both workable and satisfactory.

Adelberg contests Hoth
Hoth’s statements in article

To the Editor:

The article that appeared in the
March 11 issue on Sandy Holh’s
court appeal of her nonrenewal
Contained a number of factual
errors and other distortions in
Statements attributed to Hoth that
warrant correclion. '

The article states that “Hoth
said it was true that she was not
claiming sex disc' nation, at
that time (of her ' al appeal)
because discrimination was not
one of the grounds on which the
College would allow her in base an
appeal." This is simply false, It
was public knowledge and was
explicitly stated to her that
discrimination was one of three
acceptable grounds for an appeal
(the others being procedural error,
including new information, and
violation of academic freedom).

Ms, Hoth is quoted as saying that
she had told Walker that the
agreed on procedure was “not any
way in handle an appeal since the
ad hoc subcommittee that was set
up was comprised of four
Executive Council members who
had made lhe original decision,”
The fact is that she had suggested
that her appeal he heard by lhis
very body, the Executive Council.
There was not then, nor is there
yet, any formal alternative appeal
procedure, although one is
currently under consideration.

The most disturbing part of lhe
interview with Ms, Hoth is her
allegation that she was ”denied the
constitutional right to face her
accuser." This is a serious
misrepresentation of the faculty
evaluation process as a judicial
one, which it is not and should not

be, Rather it is a process of peer
review in which a group of
representative faculty, after
considering as much evidence as it
can assemble, exercises its
judgement about the quality of the
faculty member under con-
sideration. The key determination
is Whether the individual meets the
institution’s standard of ex-’
cellence. There is no defendant and
there are no accusers.

l have no desire to enter into a
public discussion of the merits of
Ms. Hoth’s termination or of her
court appeal. My intention here,
apart from correcting some fac-
tual errors. is to suggest that the
judicial model proposed is inapr
propriafe and does not conform to
the realities of academic decision-
making—Arnold Adelberg

KDIC blasts Blair

To the Editor:

On Tuesday, March 9, We, lhe
KDIC 10'30 News staff, announced
our decision lo resign from the
KDIC News Department. This was
the result of a unanimous decision
of the ninermember staff. We feel
that it is our duty lo inform the
campus and community of lhe
events which led to our decision

Throughout this academic year,
if has been our feeling [hat the
News Director of KDIC, Shelly
Blair, has exhibited a gross lack of
responsibility towards the duties of
her office. Time and time again,
we have confronted Ms Blair with
the evidence of her negligence,
However, our criticisms and
suggestions for improvement were
met with either outright contempt
or vague promisesipromlses
which were never fulfilled. It
became increasingly obvious in us
that there was only one remedy for
the rapidly deteriorating condition
of the KDIC News Department: the
removal of Shelly Blair from her
post as News Director. With this in
mind, we approached the Student
Publications and Radio Com-
mittee, by whose authority Ms.
Blair had been appointed in the
Spring of 1975, We presented the
studenlriaculty committee With the
salient details of her
mismanagement. Brieﬂy, they can
be summarized in a list of ten
points which we presented to the
committee:

1, The News Director has not
demonstrated any sort of
leadership, or contributed any
direction or ideas to the News
Deparlmcnl;

2. The News Director has not
made certain that basic staff
responsibilities are being met;

3. The News Director has not
adequately trained new staff
members:

4. The News Director has not
attempted to create a necessary
sense of unity among News Staff
members;

5. The News Director has not
made lhe News Department a
force in station programming;

6 The News Director has not
provided the College and the town
(as well as the Associated Press)
with adequalc coverage oi local
events;

7. The News Director has not
made and maintained necessary
working relationships with local
news sources;

8, The News Director has not
kept informed, or made an effort to
keep the News Staff informed, of
newsworthy local events;

9. The News Director has not
kepl personal and professional
interests separate;

ll), The News Director has not
demonstrated lhe proper amount
or care and effort necessary in
order to run an efficient, effective,
and successful News Department.

ll was our contention that as long
as Blair retained her position, it
would be impossible to effect
substantive improvements in the
News Dcparlmenl. Moreover, the
continuance of her (enure would
make the job of next year's News
Director much more difficult. But
after a series of hearings, in»
cludlng a closcdrdoor session
between MS. Blair and members of
the committee, a decision was
reached: Shelly Blair would
continue to serve as News
Director. .

After the final meeting. Certain

membersof the committee made it
clear that lheir decision was based
more on jurisdictional con.
sideralions lhan on any positive
evaluation of Blair’s performance.
However, we feel dial by their
decision, the committee opted for
Continued deterioration and in
definilely postponed any hope of
greatly needed changes,

If \ve are not to bury our sense ol
responsibility to the members ol

’

f

i.

the college community, we feel .

that our protest'is unavoidable.
The direction of the KDIC News
Department should be me concern
of every Grinnell Student. Well
over $1000 of student lunds is spent
annually on the operation of KDIC
News. ll the News Department has
not provided an adequate service
to the student body of this college,
your money has been wasted.

We sincerely regret that [his
problem had to be resolved in this
manner. The decision to resign was
not an easy one for any of us to
make, We fully understand the
difficult position that the com-
mittee found itself in as a result of
this controversy. At the same time,
we hope that the committee, as
well as the Grinnell College
community, can understand our
position. All of us are dedicated to
[he principles of responsible and
reliable journalism, and we cannot
reconClle ourselves in working
under a news director Who is ob
viously not dedicated to those same
