I give you the mildest, best-tasting

smoke—because I am made' of center
leaves only. The top leaves are unripe,
bitter, biting. The bottom leaves are
coarse, sandy, harsh. The center leaves
are the choice leaves. They are mildest,
mellowest, yet richest in ﬁne tobacco
ﬂavor. And I offer you the fragrant,
expensive center leaves exclusively. I
do not irritate your throat. That’s Why

I dart: to say, “I’m your best friend.”
