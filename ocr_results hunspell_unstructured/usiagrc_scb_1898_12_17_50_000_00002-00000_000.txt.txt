THE BANNER that was won by
the ’96 track team of Grinnell Cole
loge, in the Western Intercolle-
giate meet at Chicago, has arrived
and will be displayed at the Ath—
letic Union meeting Monday next,
These banners are given each
year to'the school winning ﬁrst
place, and was at ﬁrst awarded to
the University of Wisconsin; but
since Maybury has been acknowl-
edged as being a professional be-
tore the date of that meet, the
points won by him are no longer
counted for Wisconsin and tail to
Grinnell,thusgiving herﬁrstplace.
It was unfortunate that Maybury’s
protessionalism could not be as-
certained sooner, so that some of
those who worked so hard to win
the banner could enjoy the passes
sion of it while in school. It is,
however, a proud token ot our
work in track athletics

THE HOME Oratorical Contest
will be held next Tuesday evening
at eight o'clock in the chapel, and
deserves to be attended by every
student of the institution. With
the exception or last year, Grin
nell's record in oratory has been
for the past few years one to be
ashamed of, and the reason for it
is the lack of interest shown on
the part of the students. This

lack of interest is well seen by the
size of the audience which attends
the Home contests. It we are to
have any success in oratory, the
students mtlst show enough inter
est to support the home orators
by their presence. The iollowing
are the six contestants with the
subjects of their orations:

“American Justice," C, M. Cal-
derwood.

"Waymarks to Harmony,"
F. Coriey.

“The Industrial Problem.”
H. Crosby.

“The Herald of Liberty in the
Netherlands." W. E. Hamlin.

“Inhumanity and corrective
Methods." A, Risser.

"The Martyr of the Nile," Gret-
ta Starrett.

All-Amerlca Eleven.

In the last number of the Har-
prr’r DVee/ely, Casper w. Whitney
gives a lineup for the '98 All-
America football team as follows:

Romeyn [West Point), full-back; Dibs
blee. captain (Harvard), and McBride
(Yale), half-backs; Daly (Harvard),
quarterback; Cunningham (Miehigani,
center, Hare (Pennsylvania) and Baal
(Harvard). guards; Chamberlain (Yale),
and Hillehrand (Princeton), tackles;
Palmer (Princeton), and Hulloweli (Hare
rard), ends.

Substitution in the liile:7OVerﬁeld
(Pennsylvania), Brown (Yale), Burden
(Harvardi, Hoiighton (Harvard), Donald
(Harvard). Follwell (Pennsylvania), Poe
(Princeton).

Back at the line:7Rcid (Harvard)
Warren (Harvard), Kramer (West Point),
O'Dea (\visconsin).

1n summing up the season's
play, Whitney says that the larger
teams of the east, Harvard ex-
cepted, have made no advance
this year except tor some general
improvement in planting, but rathn
er have gone backward. The
smaller institutions oi the east
maintained a level, while the mid
die west generally have made a
perceptible advance and are ape
preaching the standard of the
eastern teams.
