Giiiintzll s ﬁrst tootball game or
the season “lll be called this at-
ternoon, at three o'clock. on \Nnrtl
heltl. The uppos‘lng team is from
Western College, and, from all
that “clean learn,is quite a husky
aggregation. Although this game
is intended primarily (or practice,
it will probably be a good game
lroni the spectators' standpoint.
and it is hoped that a large crowd
will tlirn out to witness it. This
game will serve lo bring out Grins
hell's weak points. and will give
much valuable knowledge to the
coaches. Although there will
probably be several changes in
Grlnnell's team, the following is
the lineup at the beginning of the
gumeii

ol the championship would be an
easier matter to determine. AP
rangements to this effect wete
made by the respective managers
early in the season, but at present
Drake's schedule with Iowa City
and Grimiell seems to be rather
uncertain. As the matter stands
at present however Grinnell is
scheduled to play as follows:

At Caloengathinn llnll, Friday
ntrernoon, the- society was called
to order by President Clarltc. The
i‘ollrcall pr-overl very amusing, as
it was responded to by Mother
Goose rhymes.

The music of the afternoon was
especially enjoyable The ﬁrst
nnmber was a vocal solo by Miss
Nellie Buddy, with Miss Lena
Buddy as accompanist. This is
Miss Buddy's ﬁtst appearance be.
fore a Gilnnell audience. and all
who heard her \Vlll hope to hear
her again soon.

It was a great pleasure, both to
old friends and new, to hear Mrs
Whltcomb's voice («gain in Cello
eagnthia, ot which she was runner
ly a member. She sang [tvo nnnp
bets, betng obliged to respond to
an encore.

The literary part of the pine
gram showed good preparation
but was a little too long.

Miss Berry gave a review ot
David Harurn, with a short reads
ing trom one or David's stories.
which was very good.

Miss Katherine Henderson gave
as a reading, the touching story of
"Palsy," and rendered it in such
a way as to bring out all the beaur
ty in the little life sketch.

A very interesting review of
”When Knigltthood was in Flow-
er" was given by Margaret Scams
mon. Extemporaneous \vmk eunr
sisted of the following three short
talks: “The Latest Styles," by
Ada Gai‘st; “\Nat'd Field 1 nce,”
by Ann Curry, and “SCnim’ Digs
