Reader Question
In Dealings With

To the Editor: i

it should be inconceivable that
anybody in the United states}
could still hope that the rest oi‘
the world could, even should,‘
believe in our moral superiorityl
over at least hair ot the world.

That our country's leaders
have been guilty of lying to the
people of the United States and
the rest or the world is so
shocking to many of us that the
reaction is one or dlsbellef turilv
ed immediately to proiessions oi‘
iaith in our leaders and protess
tatioiis that the acts and lies
were necessary. The platitudin»
ous arguments are given that it
was all for our good, that it was,
for the deiense ot the country,:
that these are the facts or lire
in a world tull of enemies to
the “free” world, etc.

not were these acts neces-
sary? Were these lies neces» ‘
sar ? Are these arguments
valid? What do these argu—
ments leave out? The answers
are not exactly heartening.

it has long been the claim ot,
the United States that it is the
moral leader of the world, that
it stands tor the right, the inlet
The cry has been given that the
Us is the core, the heart of the
"free" world in the ztltb cen—i
tury. ‘

We have pointed at ourselves
and asked, even demanded, that
the rest oi the “free” world
rally around us and tie itself to
us by military’alllance, in whichl
case we might throw a fewl|
economic benefits their way,
Even when we gave economic‘
aid without the strings of mili-l
tary pacts, there were nations
that were still suspicious or us.

or course, the answers to
such insubordination were the
cries of “Communists, Com-
munist sympathisers, l e t t —
wingers, ronnivers, etc," Some-
times the explanation has been
that we were uniortunatcly
aligned with imperialism in
the thoughts or some other
nations.

Of course, this was a ialse
charge as the American lndians,
Mexicans and Chinese Boxers
will verily. This point is not
made in any special condemna»
tion of these acts but rather to
point out that we are unwilling
to recognizc what those acts
have been. The rest of the world
has not been so deluded. l

Again and again responsible
and perceptive people have res
ported what and why the rest
or the world doubtcol what we
have said. As Sen. Morse points
ed out» May 6 in Darby gym, our
actions and professions have not_
coincided. i

Our admission of spying and
the spectacular actions and lies
involved with it plus our uni.
lateral canceling of the nuclear
test ban are immediate points
in this argument.

Some have had the audacity

to claim that Russia is being l

the summit wrecker by ex-
ploiting their shooting down oi

a spy plane of ours and cap-
turing our pilot. But who gave

them sneli a beautiiul oppor-

tunity or excuse? it was the

United states.

It does not matter, in this res‘
spect, whether or not the ﬂightl
was ”routine”; it does show a
remarkable lack of control on‘g
the part or our leaders, it notl
an intentional attempt to wreck‘
the summit conierence.

It we were to have been able
to claim that the Russians call»
not be trusted because right he-

fore the contcrence they shot
down an "innocent" plane, there
was a boo—boo committed somes
where. Was it Powers’ lault'!
What was his iault, if it was.
it has oiten bccn insisted upon
by our leaders that the Russians
are responsible for the lack oi
progress toward disarmament or
at least tor its slow progress. We
have been told that they have
been stubborn, impossible and
tricky. But the record does not
exude this selfsl'lglltcousncss.
The record oi the Geneva
disarmament convention that

ended Dec. 19, 1959, will Show :

anyone who is the least bit
objective that the iailure to
reach any concrete agreement
was due to the United states.
More than once we were trap—
ped by our either inlse deduc—
tions or outright lies. We re~
inscd to come to any agree

ineiit oi note, even ones which '

the British pointed out as be-
ing logical, necessary and
just.
Our

unilaleral revocation of

the voluntary nuclear test loan

is an almost anti-climactic abs

lsurdity. it is rather difficult to

swallow justifications that said

,Eisenhowcr had just given his
approval (implying he could sec‘
or was?

no reason to reconsider
powerless to do so), that the
Russians did not concur with the
Us. and British proposals for
the inclusion of nuclear explo-
sions in a coordinated East»West
program until last‘ Wednesday
and that it was necessary to test
new developments lor making
nuclear tests and for detecting
them.

The bit about the detection

may seem plausible. But more,
it has been pointed.

To the Editor:

‘ “The United states courts cons
ivict people on circumstantial evi—
‘dence all the time,” one of the
sages of the CoEHP said today in
the newly established appellate
teourt, “Why shouldn’t we be able
‘Lo do the same thing?"

“Yes, but don't iorgct this is
a closely knit campus or 500
men, not an impersonal court,"
said another member. The court
split hairs, discounted the pos-
sihilitics of doubt and added
new stories that had not ever
been heard belore.

"Why, if there is as
‘dotlbt in this case as there is,
should someone be lined?” the
other member asked.

“Oh, we are sure 01' what we
saw. Admitted. we did not see
‘an actual act pel'lormed, but the
evidence is pretty (circumstan—
Lidlly) good." said the iirst Coillp
member again,

Are your minds made up, mcmv
tiers of that “governing body"
who support the levying or this
tine at all costs? “Damn right we
are.”

We are men wli have been
placed into a pos n or au-
tliority; we have power—why
should we bend to the w ims oi
those who think we should wa-
ver because we are not sure.

“I thought you said you were
sure. 0 man oi power and pres»
Lige!" "Oh, that is right, we are
sure. i forgot"

One more brilliant question in
this trial: “Do you have any fire~
works in your room?" the opens
minded non—voter asked.
