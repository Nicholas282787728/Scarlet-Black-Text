Coming out of country closet

 

Country
from pg. 1.3

you choose to believe it, in much country music, those
clichés don’t surface. just think about the amount of
country now on pop stations, sandwiched between

the likes ofiustin Timbcrlakc and

my girl Beyonce.

Without turning the dial to one
of Iowa’s many country stations,
you can listen to Faith Hill, car-
i'Ic Underwood, the Rascal Flatts,
or the adorable Taylor Swift as
she laments about the “Tcardrops
on her guitar" To my knowledge,
not one of these artists has yet felt
the need to wax on about truck—
driving through Oklahoma, and if
ouc of thcm chose to do so, what

would be the harm?

emanates.

Those who do listen to the more traditional count
try music need not be ashamed. Listening doesn't re
quire you to embody Christian ideals or subscribe to
commonly held gender roles. It's okay to enjoy music
without any attachment to the lifestyle from which it

Just because I may listen to the Geto Boys’“Damn

rap and hipehop songs doesn't necessarily signal that

I participate in gang violence or enjoy “skeet skeetmg"
all over the News (not to say that I don’t).

It's ridiculous to hate an entire genre of music be-
cause orrhe sociopolitical outlooks to which its artists

may or may not adhere, I believe 1
read somewhere that Hitler was a

No longer will I feel the need

universal sign of country music

tolerance, of course) in order to discern whether or

not it is acceptable to rock out to a little bit of Kenny
Chesney while hanging out with a peer whose taste in
music I do not know.

When it comes down to it, I’m all about banging
my head to the Dropkick Murphys or kicking back

while listening to The Sliinsibut sometimes I need

to remind myself of the Devil’s trip down to Georgia

Scared of Noyce? Darcy Ward ’09 breaks down the developments of the wide world of science for you

My stay-at-home dad was infamous
at my elementary school for being the
guy that once brought in a cow heart
and lung to my third-grade class and
encouraged everyone to put Ziploc
baggies on their hands and poke at the
organs. In

h i g h
school, he
brought in
his slide
show of
Thai reﬁl-
gcc camps
and BXT
plaincd hook worms to my horrified
American history class.To the ladies at
the library he was the gentleman who
checked out rhc obscenely dctailcd
books on ant behavior. I knew him as
the guy that shoved all this stuff down
my throat,

Every day throughout elementary
school my brother and I had a mane
datory period in which we garhcrcd
around the family bibleithe DK Scin
cnce Encyclopedlniand listened as
my dad lovingly described how global
warming was going to kill us all. Of-
ren rhcsc readings led to “experiments"

than Christopher Columbus and crew.

This research is the first to exams
iue the genetic makeup and evolutionr
ary past of strains of bacteria known
as trcponcmcs that cause syphilis and
related diseases. Researchers isolated 21
genetic regions from 26 strains oftrepv
nemes found throughout the world,
and by looking at how often there were
altcrations in the gene sequences of
different strains. the investigators wcrc
able to distinguish between older and
younger strains and identity evolutions
ary relationships between them.

This work has dated the first Eu-
ropean outbreak to have been in 1495.
It is unsurprising that C. Colum and

you imagine walks

(olurnbus: the tongue cancer thing
is way late in the game,

It’s true! According to my Merck
Manual ochdical Information (a gift
from you-know-who), syphilis, “if unr
treated for many years, may give rise to
tongue cancer,” which Merck makes a
big deal out of, because “it is the only
cancer that forms on the top or the
tongue."

Good news, though, prospective
posrhunieus-sleepers—with-columbus:
the tongue cancer thing is way late in
the gamc. With early treatment just
about everybody gets better. Even the
unsightly sores foi which syphilis is
known are painless and heal in 3 to
12 weeks. if ignored, though, symp-
toms range from “mild to devastating”

and any number or
terrible things can
happen, including
inﬂammation of the
eyes,

This is all well
and good to know
and the research at
Emory seems to be helpful in figurr
ing out how to eradicate syphilis, but
I think the real take home message
here is pretty obvious: for all his faults,
Christopher Columbus was a G.
