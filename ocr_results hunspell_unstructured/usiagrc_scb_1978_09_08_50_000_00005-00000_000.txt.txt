Iowa is often called a
Democratic state. The elections
this November will determine just
how strung the Democratic hold on
Iowa is. Iowa's liberal Democratic
enator. Dick Clark, is seeking re-
election in one of this year's crucial
races,

In 1977, Americans for
Democratic Action. a group that
rates senators, called Clark the
most liberal member of the US.
Senate. In contrast. his opponent.
Roger Jepsen, has strong right
lung appeal. Included among his
. active supporters are Ronald
Reagan, New Hampshire
Governor Meldrim Thompson. and
Richard Vigueric who is famed for
his direct mail support of George
Wallace.

JEPSEN SEEMS T00 right-
wing when compared to the people
Iowans have elected in recent
years. but it is important to note
that Iowa is a State With a tradition
oi staunch Republicanism lowa
has elected “Roger Jcpsens”
many times in the past in fact, no
Democrat in Iowa’s history has
ever been rcrclcctcd to a second
term in the US Senate.

it was only in recent years that

 

 

national events, notably Vietnam
and Watergate. coupled with a
strong Democratic organization
under llarold Hughes, have
transformed Iowa to its present
status Clark won in an upset
election in 1972 Congressman
Culver. his formcr boss, was
elected to the Senate in 1974, Also
that year, Democrats gained
majorities in both houses of the
lowa legislature a majority of the
courthouses. and carried five of the
srx congressional races,

may well have stirred up and
strengthened conservative voices
that have been relatively silent in
Iowa for some time. Those forces
will have lots of money to spend:
On the other hand, they will have to
contend with the Democrats'
strong organization. In particular
the Democrats have the Voter
Identification Program, which is
nationally known for its
sophistication. and does an ei-
iective job oi turning out
Democratic votes. Whether more
conservative forces will bc able to
set back Democratic gains this
year remains to be seen. The
legislature will most likely go
Republican again because oi a
large number oi retirees, The
outcome oi the Clarerepsen race
is much more doubtful.

Also in doubt in my estimation. is
the outcome of the Ray-Fitzgerald
race. Iowa's popular, moderate
Republican governor is supposedly
unbeatable in his bid for reelection
this year It should not be
overlooked. however, that Fili-
gerald has an unusual number at
factors going ior him that

Freshman finds follies

As a freshman in only his second
wcek here, i really only ieel
qualified to write about one thing:
the impressions ot a newly arrived
freshman. Makes sense, doesn't II?
1 choose to address two specific
phenomena of Grinnell College
which i have recently been ex-
posed to: the dormitory welcome
and bakery runs

Shortly after arriving on campus
and moving my belongings into the
luxurious second story apartment I
have Come to call home, I was told
by some people who appeared to be
in charge that I would be par~
ticipating in the North and South
Younker water balloon fight.
Naturally l was curious, and i was
also offered no choice in the
matter, so i proceeded cautiously
outside,

NOW I DON‘T KNOW who came
up with the idea of a new student
water fight, but it was definitely a
stroke of genius. It offered a
chance to get acquainted with new
neighbors and at the same time
iind out just how vicious they could
be. There’s a certain intimacy in
being smashed from all sides by
strangers hurling missiles One
fellow introduced himself by hit-
ting me With a balloon point-blank
in the back of the head (and inside
the dorm. yet). He turned out to be
my roommate, and that informal
little meeting really helped to
break the ice (as well as my
glasses and possibly a few ribs).

Having thus become very close
to those I was to live with, and
hearing of an interestingsounding
event called a bakery run
scheduled for that evening, I

, decided it wouldbe iustgreat to get
a group from my floor to go. So
when two a.m. rolled around i
ventured enthusiastically to the
room across the hall and knocked,

 

shouting. "Hey, it's time for the
bakery run’ C'moli outl”

THE ROOM W \5 silent for 1|
tlmc. and then a o eepy voice said,
"Who's that?”

“It's inc. Tom. from across the
hall," I replied, “Let’s go!"

"TOM WHO?" SAID the voice.
and a second one Joined it,
mumbling something to the eiiect
oi “Go away "

I tried to explain that bakery
runs were an important aspect of
the Grinnell experience, and that
permanent social and emotional
scarring could result from missillg
this crucial initial event. The
voices began to sound even more
annoyed, and assured me that they
would be fine and that I ought to
run along Other voices joined in
encouraging me to do so by giving
such advice as “Get lost!" and
“Hey, shut up!"

SEVERAL DAYS later, some
residents of my floor finally got on
the ball and decided that they
should get a bakery run under their
belts before it was too late. I was
hesitant this time. having been
snubbed before. but I iinally gave
in and off we went.

 

Midway in our journey, we came
upon some delightful gentlemen

foolish

who greeted us by brandishing
their back sides and lowering their
trousers Being new to this tlrca
I've decided to give them the
benefit of the doubt and call It a
regional custom rather than a
disgusting display oi stupid ob
noxious behaviour. as I would back
home, tThis is not to say I have a
bad opinion of the Grinnell coma
munity in generalel'm not in the
habit of letting a few asses speak
for a whole town.)

Ava.“ As WE neared the
baker I \vas hit by the sneaking
suspicion that it might be the night
before Labor Day. The establish
mciit was closed, coniirming my
hypothesis, Thwarted. we returned
home, takinga dittereniroute so as
not to disturb the wildlife we had
encountered earlier, I don't think
I'll go on bakery runs anymore

Well, that Just about covers the
most formative events of my in
troductory days at Grinnell (with
the exception of a party which I
won't even bring up» and utter all
that, I even kind of like it here If
you've had any interesting or
unusual ireshman experiences.
please iot them down on three by
iive note cards and drop them in
anyone's box except minc,

The worst part of it all, however,
is linals. A short walk through any
one at the dorms during finals tor

cxcmpliiy my point. Typewriters

it's not because everyone has left

procrastinate to some extent, but i
am convinced that it is virtually
impossible to linish the semester
without feeling some degree of
pressure.

The solution is iar from simple.
We cannot eliminate the sources of
these pressures, unless oi course
we opt to drop out oi school. This is
no solution, however. since there

Different people iind peace of

transcendental meditation is the
‘answer. although this does not
