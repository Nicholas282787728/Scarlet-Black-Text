IN DEFENSE OF THE LEAGUE
From "The nnily Trojan")

That the League of Nations has been weighed and
found sadly wanting is no news in this country, Tile
American press has put the League in a bad light, draw-
ing- its ballyhoo from the failures of the League in set-
tling the Far Eastern conﬂict. We admit that tho
League has failed badly; but we claim our support
should not be prematurely withdrawn from this peace
machinery,

in the attitude of the United States toward the
League may be found the cause of the weak action of
the League five months ago at Miikilen, if we had
stuck to the Wilsouian theory of international cooper-
ation, rather than adopt the absurd policy of isolation,
Shanghai would probably not been a battleground and
Japan would have kept hcr place.

Let us look at this plan and policy of the United
States.

We rejected the League because of a belief that we
could promote the same ends better through another
planit‘ne Harding plan of isolation. We refused the
Wilson plan because of lack of interest in oi opposition
to world peace and prosperity. We foolishly thought
we could better help the world from the outside than as
a member of the League. We have tried to raise isola-
tion to a place where it would provide both us and others
with insulation against poverty and war.

Economically the United States claimed that we
could increase prosperity and power to buy in other
countries by our own prosperity, regardless of cooper-
ative measures in tariff reduction, wheat production, and
trade obstruction. What was the result? Early in
1929 the United Statcs was so close to proving this
theory that other countries began to believe in it and
followed our example by raising tariffs to the skies,
Then came the crash. And our plan has become a
thing of the past; but the Wilsonion theory has surr
vivcd very well compared with the Coolidge market and
has cost the world much less.

politically we have advaoccd the theory again and
again that we could he a stronger force outside the
League than in. We have confined our intervention to
only those disputes which affect ccuiitrics in which we
have interests, or claim to have interests. We have
signed the Kcllogg»Briand Pact renouncing war; but
we have taken no steps to deal wrth a nation disturbing
the peace We have laughed at the Wilson plan of
bringing crring nations to reason, thinking public opinr

ion was enough, We condemned the Wilsonian plan for ’

machinery to enforce inter-national law. thinking mani-
fest moral indignation would Suffice,

Has our plan failed? Rather.

The United states has followed the League in every
step toward peace in the Far East. Yes, we have never-
bcen ahead of the Leagueealways a day or two eiapscs
bcfore we made the same official remarks as the League
only in differ-cut words.

What was the result 7

We kept our isolated position, yes We were moral-
ly indignant at the atrocities in Shanghai. But. the
Japanese guns continued firing. We have merely sent
cur-t letters to the Japanese, demanding this and that,
and getting a laughing sneer for our efforts,

/ ’Thztt our plan has failed is quite apparent.
thank God, the League plan still survives,

We hear or ism of the League everywhere. “Why
has it fooled away five months?" ask the critics.
We might reply that the League has been trying out
the Harding plan.

During the past several years the United states has
found the League plan wanting, The League has really
tried the theory advanced by our country—with the
expected result. It. seems that the least we can now do
is give the Wilsonian plan a chance to show what it
can do!

But,

The Scrulet and Black

Crimiell, lowo

Dear sir; _

in answer to the letter by a mem-
ber of the gymnastic team, the Hon-
or,“G“ wishes to make the following
explanation. This is not an apology,
for its actions war-rant none.

One would suppose we are a group
with a perverted code of ethics and
rules at conduct which ridicule and
cast aspersions upon the efforts of
those individuals who haye chosen
some phase of physical developmcnt
other than major sports.

This )5 far from true, for the
Honor “G" was most appreciative of
the gymnasts efforts through reali-
zation of the hard work, the mental
and physical coordination necessary
for an exhibition of that naturc and
were sincerely intcrcstcd in the per-
formanee.

The Honor “G” sat in a body dur-
ing the game to quell booing of play-
ers and officials, This was accomp-
lished to no small degree. Then why
should we boo the entertainment be-
tween halves, when it would defeat
the very purpose for which we were
united?

True. during the game, some of
our members laughed moderately as
would the gymnast had situations
been reversed. IL is a natural tend-
cllcy for anyone to find amusement
in organized forms of building-up ex—
ercises

This was far from ridicule, how-
ever, and the Honor “G" did make a
sincere attempt to quiet derisive rev

made to the participants by
some individuals and to put the Sun
tire audience in a receptive mood.
if the exhibition had been given in
the presence of Honor '5” men and
women alone; if that participant
could have been with the Honor “G"
during the performance, perhaps his
conclusions as to their depraved con-
duct would have been dlfferent.

We do not feel that the Honor “G”
needs any defense from such an ac-
cusation, but We do wish to correct
any erroneous impression gathered
from the “participant's" article.

Respectfully,
The Honor '

that they in return give you a boost

But the writer was interested in
