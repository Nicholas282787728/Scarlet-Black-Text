WASHINGTON, D.C.: Afrer a ric
diculously long wair, an unconvenrionai
ruling by rhe Supreme Courr has finally
chosen a presidenr eleer. Candidarcs Bush,
Gore, rhc u. Supreme Courr, and rhe
lawyers for borh candidares all agreed rhar
a game ofHORSE would be she besr way
ro derermine rhewinner ofrhis recenr farce
ofan elecrion. Per rhose nor familiar wirh
ir, HORSE is a baskerball game in which
opponenrs make free rhrow shors, and rhe
ﬁrst person re make five a rhe number of
lcrrcrs in “horse“ e is rhe winner. Afrer
weeks ofarguing over srarc and fedeial elcc.
rion rules and rcgularions, rhe High Courr
heard rhe case, and decided rhar all elce.
rion rcrurns should be discarded, and rhar
a more simple merhed should be used re
dererminc who will lead rhc free world for
rhc next four years: lawyers negoriared for
several hours before agreeing on HORSE;
orher possibi ies were discussed included
reek, paper, scissors (whar in do in rhe
cvenrofa ric pur rhis game ourofrhe run-
ning). Barrlcship (Bush’s lawyers ebjeered,
saying rhar Gore's experience as vice Pre
denr gave him an unfair advanragc in “milie
rary" games), Risk (ditto), hepscorch
(Bush's ream again obieercd, saying rhis
game was roe “girly”), and chess (come on,
we all know Bush can'r play chess). Once
rhe game began, Gore pulled ahead early
on, gaining borh an “H" and an “0" be.
fore Bush had successfully made any shors.
bur Bush recovered and ended up rhe win.
ner. Polirical analysis are in disagreemenr
as re wherher such children's games will
permanenrly replace rhc Elccroral College,

quesrien.

VATICAN CITY: in a srailing change
offairh, Pope John Paul II resigned rhis
week, saying he "ceuldn'r keep rhe chaiade
up any longer,“ The new former Ponriff
said he would devore rhe remainder ofhis
life so preaching rhe Raelian religion,
which claims rhar human beings were cmc
arcd in laborarories on anorhcr planer.
According re sources inside rhe Varican,
rhe Pope. on a recenr visir ro New York
Ciry, donned rhe clorhes of a layman in
order ro ”walk among his people," While
our eommuning wirh rhe masses, he mer a
man on rhe corner of64rli and Broadway
who rold him rhar Jesus was merely one of
many prophers senr ro barrh ro rell hu.
maniry abour rheir exrrarerresrrial origins.
People all over rhe world are shocked ar
rhc Pope’s deserrien ofhis religion. Who
wouldnr believe a srrange man on a sireer
cerner waving a sign rhar promises rhe
“rrue face of God"? One Cardinal inside
Sr. Pcrcr's. who wished ro remain anony-
mous, said rhar John Paul was “much more
naive rhan I rhoughr," and rhar rhe man
rhe Pope ralked re mnsr have been “a real
piece ofwork.”

“organicl" rhc labels scream. Slap “Fm Free" on ir and ir becomes
manna fonvelghlcwatihnrs everywhere. “Guaranieed. . . oryour money
back!” “Free Trial!" “see lnsranr results!" Everyday we srruggie ro keep
our heads above rhe inundarion ofcarehephrases and appealing oneclinc

and “Nuclear," wharever rhe context, conjure images ofmushroom clouds,
Chernobyl, and rumors rhc size efa small European narion. A new phrase
has reeenrly enrered our vocabulary and has perhaps become rhe dirriesr
ofall: “Genetically Modiﬁed."

Generieally modified crops rhar have been in rhe ﬁelds and en rhe
news are rhe rriumphanrculminarien ofderades ofresearrh. inirially, ir
is difficulr re imagine why so many consumers are opposed ro rhis reehe

A berrer onesrion: Whar evidence or examples are given re subsranriare
rhese flimsy phrases? very few, indeed. No one has reporred a szmilgulac

Bur, perhaps I should remind you rhara‘murarion' issimplyachangc,
and rhis is cvacrly whar generieisrs are ciearing. As you may already know.
sclecrive breeding of planrs and animals has been searching for favorable
“changes” and combinariens efdesirable rrairs for hundreds ofycars, The
process is highly uncenrrellable and comparable ro awairing a lighrning
srrike ro lighr a fire re cook your dinner. Generic modificarion is much
more precise. Bssenrially, ir is using a highly conrrolled process re creare

desirable changes in organisms. Whywair fora lighrning when you can
have marches?

Nor everyone sees rhc issue so simply. George Monbior of The aim—
dori/ Guardian blaranrly refers re “the Brave New world ofbiorechnele
ogy" in his March 2000 ariiclr, “Monsier Tomaroes or Bumper Crop?”
In a reccur address, rhe Pepe rook a srand againsr rhe “manipuiarion of
life, ar rhe service ofboundless ambirien, which deforms rhe aspirarions
and hopes ofmankind and which only increases irs sufrering." Obviously.
opponenrs chM predners have an arsenal srecked wirh an inflammae

Cerrainly. GM producrs are nor wirhour rhcir risks. Mosr,ifnorall

Dialog between capital and a slave boy

Over rhe pasr weeks i have been engaged in a bir efreseaie'h whieh
