SGA voles referendum

Quickly responding to a student
petition requesting a relerendum

n the dog controversy. Student
Government Association (SGA)
decided 10455 to hold an all-
campus vote this Wednesday, Sept.
4, in the post oilice.

Concerned dog owners and other
interested students, meeting with
Joint Boards. conceded the im-
possibility of changing present
policy to permit residence of dogs
in collegerowned housing.
However, the group expressed the

elief that students should be

'ilirectly consulted on policy which
would ban dogs from campus
grounds entirely,
Ballot Options

The referendum will read as
follows, with voters allowed one
option:

a) The owners at dogs iound on
campus will be subject to an
automatic fine.

b.) The owners of dogs found on
campus without a leash will be
subject to an automatic line.

'Pub marks

Grinnell’s student-ownedrandr
operated bar, the Pub, will mark
its first year of operation Sep
tember 15. Located directly under
Main hall, the Pub was opened
because a number of students felt
they needed an oncampus meeting
place which served alcoholic
beverages. No iormal birthday
celebration has been planned.

Q The Pub is a private club,

' financially responsible for its own
debts. Students may purchase a
membership to the Pub lor two
dollars, an investment which will
he returned at the end of the school
year should a profit be shown,
according to Pub managers.

Mark Nissen, a junior, is starting
his second ryear as the, bars
manager. Nissen, recommended
for the job by lormer student body

.tlcerpresident John Pfeffer,
previously ran a bar in Cedar
Rapids, l-le terms the Pub an over-
all success, and draws notice to the
fact that, “One of the things that !
think is really great is that we
provide us student jobs. It‘s student
involvement.”

Hours

The Pub is opened from 4 pm. to
1:30 a.m. Monday through Thur-
sday. it remains open until 2 am

Qoth Friday and Saturday, but
opens later at 7 pm. Its at~
mosphere is one of beer, friends,
ioosball, jukebox tunes, and live
band music almost every Friday

c.) The owners of dogs found on
campus and complained about will
be subject to an automatic fine.

Present policy, approved by SGA
last spring, does not allow dogs
within the boundaries formed by
Sixth Avenue, East Street, Tenth
Avenue, and Park Street, and
including off-Campus college-
owned housing. Should the
referendum result in a Joint
Board’s vote to amend this policy,
the change would also have to be
approved by the Social Policies
and Regulations committee
iSP&R) and president of the
college, Glenn Leggett.

Signatures Gathered

A seasignature petition resulted
from efforts to delay an SGA
recommendation to SPier con-
cerning pet policy enforcement.
Said one concerned student, “The
opportunity is being given to you to
be a representative government."

Joint Boards did vote a
recommendation for SP&R on
enforcement matters not covered

night.

Although the Pub is heavily
congested from to p.m. on. Nissen
stresses that the hours between 7
pm. and 10 pm. are excellent
times for meetings, organized and
otherwise. Last year the Chess
Club played there on Tuesday
nights.

“News and Brews", another
popular time, is between 4 p.m.
and 6:30. Students gather then to
drink 25 cent beer and Watch the
evening news.

LookingAbead

Looking’into the Pub‘s future,
Nessen hopes to have an art
display to decorate the west wall.
In addition. a committee will be
organized, and money will be spent
to get some new furnishings and
equipment.

Because oi a refusal by truckers
to cross picket lines, Nissen has
been forced to haul in all of the
beer himself so far this semester.
Despite this difficulty, the Pub still
offers a variety of beverages. it
serves draught beer, Bud and
Schlitz dark, and beer by the
bottle: 01y, Miller, Pabst, Schlitz,
Bud, Falstaff, Heineken, and
Michelob. The soft drinks are Dr.
Pepper, RC, Seveanp, root beer,
and orange. Snacks are also sold.
Beer by the mug is 40 cents, and by
the pitcher $1.75. Soft drinks are 25
cents‘a glass.

in the referendum. The resolution
provides that an automatic $20 fine
be imposed on students owning
dogs in collegeowned housing and
that if such dogs are not removed
within seven days that an ad
ditional twenty dollar a day fine be
imposed.
Leash Law Failed

Dogs originally were banned
from campus last semester
following a rash oi complaints by
townspeople and students, and
failure of the Pet Owners
Association to adequately curtail
the incidents. A temporary leash

representatives asked, "29 cents.
then 30 cents, and now 35 cents in
the first year. Every time we talk
to your representatives, it costs us
more to settle."

STB

5 Adkins:

The last formal offer made by
the college included across the
board increases of 26 cents per
hour for the first year of the con
tract and 24 cents for the second
year. An additional paid holiday
and an additional week of paid
vacation tor employees with 15
years of service were also included
in the proposal.

Members of Local 90 rejected
that offer August 22 by a 54-0 vote.
‘Decent Offer'

Paul Neal, Vice-President of
Local 90 and the
representative oi the union at the
bargaining table, had told the soil;
on Monday that the 26 and 24 cents
per hour increases were ”a decent
offer with one exception.”

Neal said that the college has
accumulated $50,000 in unpaid
salaries during the five weeks
employees have been on strike.
Because that money was budgeted
for BilzG, Neal reasoned, it should
be spent for Baa. By his
calculation, a nickel per hour
should be added to the college’s
offer for 'each week the strike
continues. in other words, the
college should now be offering 25
cents an hour more for the first
year than their 26 cents an hour
offer.

‘frnrnoral'

No reference was made to that
proposal in Leggett's Thursday
letter, but administration officials

law instituted in the spring also differed strongly with Neal’s

portunity to discuss alternatives
listed on the referendum ballot in
hall meetings this week, and in an
open forum chaired by the SGA
cabinet Tuesday evening (location
to be announced).

suggestion. President Leggett told
the SBtB that it would be “imr
moral" to pay the workers moneys
budgeted for them for a period in
which they did not work. Money
accrued in unpaid wages may be
needed to contract for some of the
essential work that has been left
undone due to the strike, Leggett
said.

Neal and Local 90 union steward
Hollis Sisco have maintained that
the new contract ought to contain a
cost of living clause. In fact, in his
Thursday letter to Physical Plant
employees, Leggett said, “We
have been told that there can be no
chance of a settlement without a
costoi living clause.” Neal told the
5&8 that the costcfrliving feature
was a real “comer” in union
contracts. .

Fringe Benefits

The union and the college also
differ on fringe benefit proposals.
The employees have been getting
two weeks paid vacation and the
union has asked that after five
years, workers be given an ad-
ditional day oi paid vacation each
year until after ten years the
employee has earned three weeks.
The college has amended its offer
to provide an additional day of
vacation year worked, up to three
weeks, for each year after lo
years.

Under the last contract, emr
ployees were given six paid
holidays. The college has proposed
one additional holiday; ﬂ-le union
would like three.

Medicallnsnrance

The union is also seeking
coverage of employee dependens
under the medical insurance
program, and a boost in the 4 per
cent of salary that the college
contributes each year to a pension
fund.

charges of barrassment and
obstruction by the union were
renewed this week when .police

official

were called in to escort trucks
which were crossing picket lines to
bring in food and other essential
supplies. The truckers were
reportedly being verbally
harrassed, and there were unr
conlirmed reports of rocks being
thrown at one of the trucks en.
tering the Cowles parking lot,

Earlier in the week, Neal said
that the union resented the charges
of vandalism. He said he knew
nothing about egg throwing and
that the other problems were “an
act of God or equipment failure.“
Neal also contended that some of
the incidents may have been
caused by college officials
themselves and that the reports of
vandalism were intended by
college oiilciolsto give the union a
black eye.

Sisco have charged that college

during the strike. Dean of the
College Waldo Walker said that
Dale l-lawn, director of the
physical plant was the only ad-
ministration figure on vacation.
Hawn was gone 3 or 4 days, Walker
said.

While the negotiations Continue,
strikers are getting $25 a Week in
strike pay lrom the union. Some
are supplementing this meager
income with partrtime or tem-
porary jobs.

Student Support

Student support for the workers
was demonstrated Wednesday
night as about 100 students
gathered in Crazy House to discuss
ways in which they could aid the
striking workers. Plans were made
to ask students to check out their
Saturday night steaks and donate
them to the BM} employees and
their families. To help inform the
college community of the issues
and facilitate communication
between the strikers and college
management, the students decided
to organize either hall meetings or
an all—campus meeting with union
representatives, BM} workers and
college oiticials pending the out-
come of today‘s negotiating
session,
