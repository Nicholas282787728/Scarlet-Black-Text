JRC 007 is about to receive a $53,000 facellft. After spend»

ng the ﬁrst academic year of its existence in vacant obscurity,
lans are now being realized to transform this

Elondcscript storage room in the basement of the
ampus center into the new campus pub.

At the moment, the space itself is an empty
ascment room with concrete ﬂoors and walls,
uorescent lighting and an exposed ceiling. “it's
‘elrlly n dank little place," explained SGA Pr'csis
out Chris Hall '07. Hall said that construction
this summcr will work [(7 make the space more
“cozy“ by painting the walls, adding new lighting
ind constructing the bar, iir addition to adding ventilation and
lumbing facilities. The goal I-lall added, is not In embellish
the currently unnamed puh, but to “shoot initially for pracris
n1 needs. \Vllll the startup costs of the pub totaling about
40,000 more than initial estimates, these practical needs will
ncludc construction costs as well as allowances for entertain-
rient and, ofcoursc, alcohol.

Although the pub has not yet received' its liquor license and
ontrrots with distributor-s have not bcen signed, the campus
rub committee does have .r clear idea about what will be served
her “To begin," l‘lirll explained, “on ecr it ill be served in
lastic bottles, until the adminib‘tlaiion is more comfortable

 

Student Pub Hubbub: Plans move forward on drinkin’,
thinkin', faculty—student linkin' establishment in JRC

will be ii “decent selection” and that prices will be affordable,
with one bottle of beer costing between one to three dollars.
The pub will also oFfer limited food and snack selections, with
the requirement that in order to be open to all stun
dents half of the pub’s sales must be from food. The
committee is also exploring potential entertainment
optionswhiclr could include pool tables,a ﬂat screen

television, jukebox or touch screen videogames.
According to Vice President for Strident Servic-
es Tom crady, the new pubs alcohol selection will
be limited to beer because the pub committee “is
looking tor a way to encourage responsible drink—
Crady hopes that the pub wrll offer an op-
portunity fontg faculty, staff and students to gather after classes

and drink together

Clady has advocated for the establishment ora campus pub
for some time but it was not rrrrtil this semester that concrete
plans were developed, thinks to the campus prrb committee on
which Hall and Crady both serve. Assistant Dean Slrcrec Air—
drcwt, also on rht corninitlcc, added that the pub will be open
lo the whole Campus communiti "and all students are welcome,
even lfminors will be unable to purchase alcohol According
to Andrews the now pub is intended to resurrect tlrc pub that
was where Bob’s is now" that ﬁrst opened in 1972 and was tr
popular- dcstrualioir [or students and professors. The Bob's bar

to 21. Andrews said the new pub will most likely he man—
aged along the lines as Bob’s, with student servers and man-
agement with administration oversight.

The thought of having a space to socialize wirh faculty
and staff has many students excited for the opening of the
pub.

“I think it’s going ro be great," said Matt Johnson ’08,
who is also involved in an SGA~ sponsored campaign to
name the pub. “I think itwould be one oftlre greatest things
if faculty and legal students had a place to have a blast to:
gtthcr." Othcr students, however, are concorrrod that the pub
will keep students from experiencing the 'ghtlifc that the
town of Grinncll offers. “People wouldn't have to walk as
far," said Jayme Siegel ’07, "but it might be isolating the cam-
pus too much,"

Still, Siegcl and Johnson agree that the campus pub reps
resents a unique opportunity for students to enjoy a becr tor
gotlrer or with staffaird tacirlry without leaving campus. Ac
cording to crrdy, while low other colleges have onvc‘dmpus
bars, a pub at Griuucll would be successful because of the
srr ess rlrc college has had in administering a responsible
rlcolrnl policy. Vile trcal studcnts as adults, Ci rdy said, .rnd
we think our policy has been working."

The candidates ror pub names arc: The Capitalist Pig~
Dog, The Endowment, The GrSpot, The Howard Krolrn,
ind Selleck's.

Hall added that he expects rlrcre

"I'm here probably 4 hours a
day, so about 28 hours a week.

I study, talk to friends.
go to the game room... yeah.
I'm in the game room a lot. I
cvcn bought my own pool cue
at WalsMurt. The forum is worthless... Tire
atmosphere here is prettylight,l don't get scrir
ous work done because I sec too many friends.
we spend a lot orrimc hanging out here."

Alex Pcitz '10, Dibble “I
spend 25 hours maybe here it
week. I eat, work, do horne-
work, and socialize here. A lot
ofupperclassmen said there is a
rrft, but our class,wc don't have
that. We can with all three sides
of campus. And when you eat with someone,
you learn a lot about them. As more and more
classes come, they’ll get used to this as the cen-
lot. When this is all people know, it definitely
will be the centert”

“I‘m hcrc probably once a

week for less than twenty mine

utcs.l occasionally get a snack,

, check my mail. I do not eat at

the during hall since I’m not

on the meal plan, I would say

maybe it’s a center for uirdcrclassmcn, cope
cially iroshmon and sophomores brrt 1 would
say that I don't see many upperclassmcn here I
ihink those people are scattered all over carn-
pus. Even though everyone is eating in the
some place in the dining hall,

people are still going to sit in

their special sections and they’re

still going to create little nooks

Patrick Murray ’08, l-iaines
I spend a couple hours a day
in tthRC, 10—30 minutes a day
besides all three meals. [The at-
mosplierc] depends. When the dining hall is
open, its nice at that time orday There’s lots
orsturr going on. At night, it just seems lrke
it’s not necessary. There's just those one or two
people at the info desk, There are deﬁnitely
places on campus that havc died Mrin lounge,
nobody goes rhcrc anymore The library, you
could easily got a study break grab a tea or cot:
fee, but now its far away. The biggest thing
for me is the prices. Tire forum prices wcl'c
overpriced but the grill is just ridiculous. Goes
graphically,‘ its deﬁnitely the center of campus
but I don’t know if' it s quite reached the level
ofsocial center It probably will in a few years,

once it s more acccssrblc tron around Noyce is
like a Wlll ifyoure oomrng from the lrbrary or
around there T.here used to be a good halt of
campus that you just didrrt set: lralfthc time,
And I think that s a good thing I hope rt will
change [the dynamic] I think Ive gotten to
know more North Side people. I feel like its
competing with the forum but the forum is
gone.
Allison Amplrlett ‘08, Cleve-

1m in rho ch cvcryday.l
go to meals, and I spend a lot
oft‘uuc at the Grill ‘rlli(l also the
SGA orhoes. I use rt to study,
read, hangout sometimes. 1
probably spend 3 or inorc hours
probably a day in the Grill, It's dcrnrircly difr
fcrcnt from the Forum. I miss the Forum. I
don't think [the IRC] quite has that buzz that
the Forum has, but I think it‘s growing... In
the afternoon, it's real quiet and real slow. But
at night sometimes, it kind or picks up It's a
lirrlc moi-c cxciting, It's deﬁnitely quieter than
the Forum used to be. I think people study
here more. 1 know less where people live. Ifyou
ate at Cowlcs or rlad you were pretty much
guaranrctd ro know itromconc lived on North
or south 1 {col like I live really far away from
everything now that I live in Cleveland, and
in the past I dorrt think that would have been
true. I really miss the area outside Post Office
and the area between the Post Officc and the
lorum where everyone was always between
clrsscs and rhar never happens now. Its defr
nirclv goinr to change [campus life] I think.

How has the JRC changed campus life?

The stereotypes ofNorth, South,and Eastwill
probably change.

 

Mike Gideon '07, Broad Street

I’m in the JRC on average
a few hours a day. Deﬁnitely in
between classes, I tend to do my
work here rather than going all
rhe way back home. Especially
rrl'm plar ing on going to dine
“Cr.” it's a nice environment
just bccausc there arc people aroundlt’s a nite
environment. I don't plan to meet friends here
brrt ifI run across people, I’ll hang out with
them. Everyone comes lrcrc to cat.Thc Forum
used to be tliC center of campus more than
any other building, but there were dehnitely'
people who didn't go to the Forum at all and
there were people who went to the Forum a
lot. I think a greater number of students use
the Grill now than used the Forum,

The forum had a nice old culture with the
seats and stuff But I think this has done a
good job replacing rr. After Mary Be Iarnes,I
don’t know if there was an after party, but there
was a lor orpeoplo hcro and it was just kind of
a central location that r bunch ofpcoplc crme
to after Harris, and I thought that was kind
of neat. That was something that I hadn’t rc-
ally remembered about the Forum... So that
might be interesting, it turned into a place
where people would come after going out.
