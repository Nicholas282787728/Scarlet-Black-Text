Tomonou night the Beloit
Blue Devils will invade Glin-
nell fol all impoltant game
with the Pioneers.

The game time has been moved
up to 7:30 p. m, and the freshman
game will begin immediately fol-
lowing the varsity tilt.

Tuesday night coach Ben Doug-
las rested his team. However, he
held hard practices Wednesday
night and last night. Tonight the
squad will go through an easy
workout to put them on edge for
tomorrow's game against the Blue
Devils.

The Beloit quintet, coached by
Louie Means, uses a singleplvot
offense that revolves around the
center. Beloit's star center,
Chuck Bacon, left last week for
the army and Dennison is most
likely to be called upon to fill the
center post.

Vern Satterthwaite and Eddie
May have been the high scorers
for the Blue Devils this season.
Previously, Grinnell tripped the
Beloit five, 50 to 48 in an over-
time game played at Beloit.

Team Hopes For
Second Viclory
Over Blue Devils

Grlnnell’s swimming team will be
diving for its second victory of
the season over Beloit here Sat—
urday at 3:00 p. m Earlier this
season the Pioneers eked out a
39 to 35 victory over the Blue
Devils at the pool of the Wiscon-
sin school.

Despite that loss Beloit. last
years conference champions, has
expressed hopes of repeating at
the top thsi year. The Pioneers
have improved with each meet
and should be stronger in their
home pool than they were at
Beloit,

Coach Marty O’Connor plans to
use the same boys he has used
in the last three meets. John
Giles, Bob Thompson, and Al
Frisbie will swim the dashes;
Thompson and Co-captajn Bob
Stewart the distances; Dud Con—
ner and Bill Findley the breast
stroke; Cocaptain Bob Jensen
and Hugh Blair the back stroke;
and Sid O’Neil Will do the diving.
Beloit‘s entries have not been
received here yet.

As the Midwest conference has-
ketball race enters the last lap,
the Fighting Scots of Monmouth
college continue to hold firmly
on to the top spot, while the Law-

rence Vikings are in second place ‘

a game and a half behind the
lllinois team,

Gn'nnell is in third place with
a. mathematical chance to come in
for a tic for the title, but that
is a remote possibility. Beloit,
with five games won and lost, is
tb other team in the first di~
vi on.

Knox, Coc, Cornell and moon
fill out the second division in
that order. However, games this
weekend might see anyone of the
second half teams displace Beloit
in the top half of the standings.

Tonight Coe invades rtipon,
which should result in a close vie»
tcry for the Kohawks, and Car-
nell plays the first place Mon-
mouth Scots in Monmouth. To-
morrow night, in addition to the
game here, Coe plays at Law-
rence, and Cornell faces Knox at
Knox. Monday night will see two
arch rivals, Lawrence and Ripon,
playing at Ripon.
