GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1941

O For the Good of Grinnell, and For the Good of the T cam—An Editorial.

Friday morning, the local heroes, the
basketball squad, leave on the 8:}?
a. m. Rocket for the most crucial
games of the season. If Saturday
night, the Pioneers down Lawrence.
and on Monday they add Bipon’s
scalp to their belt, Griilnell Will hold
her first Midwest conference basket-
ball championship.

Every Grinnell student has a
moral duty to the team, to the coach,
alld to the college to be at the star
tioil Friday morning. The squad, by
dillt of two magnificent victories on

Saturday and Monday nights, earned
some kind of on ovation. They were
lauded Monday during Victory day,
The rafters of the Alumni Recitation
hall auditorium literally shook TueS*
day morning with che s [or the
team, Le yestm‘c magm' 'ceiti would
be a rousing selidoff Friday morning
with students, faculty, and towns-
people parti lpating.

The Grinnell spirit of old has risen,
we hope, from its grave, and has
come to haunt the campus for eter-
nity. But this ghost is a timid little

creature and needs encouragement.
Let‘s nourish it along and make it
feel that, although it is a ghost, it
will be welcome on the campus and

nae are more than ready to be haunt
e .

Seriously though, the team has
played good basketball all season,
and has displayed the ability to come
through in the pinches. They’ve
shown that they have the stuff, Now
can we show them that we’ve got
tlle same kind of stuff?

team can offer a legitimate excuse
for not aiding in this superesend-off,
for the administrative committee has
sanctioned that classes Friday shall
not begin until 8:30 a. m.

Benny Douglas will be looking for
you at the station. Hap Kendall will
be looking for you at the station.
Stan Zahller will be looking for you
at the station. So will Jerry Fort,
Gene Pelsner, Pat Patterson, Ralph
Youngstrom, Edd Bowers and the

rest of the squad. You owe it to the
team to be there.

Grinnell students tried to
stretch a one day vacation in—
to a two day spree Tuesday

Robert C. Young, president
of the Student Council, and
conVlnced by Basketball
Coach Ben Douglas, they de-
cided that it won] be a good
idea to return to classes.

The threat of triple cuts
practically clinched the case
for the forces of righteous—

Young’s Bombshell Speech Stuns White House Habitues

Opinion Quiz Shows
That Students Feel
‘Flunk Day’ Flunked

By Francis Agar.

Comment at the White House re-
garding the "bombshell" talk by
Robert Young, president of the
student Council, at the “ﬂunk-
day” pep meeting yesterday morn—
ing was hushed.

To those students sitting in
the living room immediately fol-
lowing the verbal surprise, the
clink of dishes from the grill per-
foretell the unusually quiet-
sounding nickelodeon and loW<
pitched voices.

The ﬂunk-day activities had
literally flunked. Student revelry
had become a mixture of awe,

disappointment, and anger. Yet,
beneath the first vocal reactions,
one could detect an air of respect
for a men who possessed enough
nerve to dare overwhelming odds
in maintaining his convictions.

Typical of statements made
were: Kay ringel—“Noi the prop-
or place for Young to give his
little speech."

Betty I’rlntz Long—“I didn't
like the ‘noble' net. But this
Grinnell ‘half and half spirit gets
me!”

Arthur Wei-loiu—"i think he
went a little too far when no
returned his Honor ‘G’ pin. I
guess he did his job as he saw
it. It took it lot of courage to do
what he did, but i think maybe
it was the wrong kind of cour-

age."

Jone Gopleruil—"I think he has
plenty on the ball for standing
up for what he thought.”

Traveling around the campus,
one heard the subject of the talk
mentioned by almost everybody.

Henry 5, Conrad, dean of the
faculty, said, “I think it was
brilliantly done. When student
judgment is really working, it’s
wonderful."
L. Wendell Hayes, instructor in
economics, remarked, "I think it
took a lot of nerve. I approve
of it, and I admire it man who
will stand up for what he thinks
is right."

hall, stated, “I think it took a
