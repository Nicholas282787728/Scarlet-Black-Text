Discover the difference between .
“just smoking”...and Camels!

 

 

Taste the difference! No fads,
frills, or fancy stuff — simply
the finest taste in smoking.
Camels are rich, full-ﬂavored,
and deeply satisfying.

 

 

Feel the difference! The ex-
clusive Camel blend of quality
tobaccos is unequalled for
smooth smoking. Camels never
let you down.

Enjoy the diﬁerence! More
people smoke Camels, year
after year. than any other
cigarette of any kind. Try
Camels 7 they've really got it!
