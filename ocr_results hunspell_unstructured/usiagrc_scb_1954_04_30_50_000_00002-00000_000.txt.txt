All About Arena

Does Grinnell want or need a magazine? .

The third issue of this year’s Arena was distributed
yesterday, a'nd the outlook for the continued life of the
feur-year-old publication is anything but favorable.

The magazine has a circulation of somewhere abouti
400, most of it by subscription. It sells for 50 cents a
copy, $1.50 a four issue subscription. The first issue pub-
lished this year was 24 pages in size, the second and third.
dropped to 16 each, a result of raised printing costs.

The first issue was printed at the Grinnell Herald-
Register, at a'ﬂat rate of $7.50 a page. Upon examination
if its expenses, the Herald-Register found it was losing
money, and to break even raised its printing rate to $12.50.
”Jurt Field, the magazine‘s business manager, began search
ing for another printer, and found that the best available
offer was from the Marshall Printing Co.,- in Marshalltown,
at $11.40 per page. The Herald-Register matched this offer,
but the next two issues were printed at the Marshalltown l
concern. ‘

Advertising, which pays the freight on any publication
of any kind, has been difficult to obtain, and Curt Fieldl
has done a commendable job in finding advertisers in New-
ton and Des Moines. .

But the magazine makes no' money. There will un-
doubtedly be no salary for either editor or business man-
ager, and expenses are barely met. It would be rash to pre— ‘
diet that the magazine could live on in the' manner in
which it has done this year.

The change in publishers caused a delay which has
multiplied itself. The delay is the prime cause for the late-
ness of publication of this third issue. The; editor, Carol
Pitts, says the last issue of this year will be out near the
end of May.

- She noted yesterday that it is sometimes difficult to
find good material on.the campus for the mixed literary~
humor content of the magazine.‘

If Glinnell wants or needs a magazine to provide an’
outlet for campus talent, or to give local entertainment,
it had better find some way of making the publication
healthy. It could be subsidized on the semester fee. Itv
could, as one of its predecessors was, be an organ of the
English department. A lower sales price might bring more .
subscribers, a good talking point in selling ads.

While the Board of Publications will have to aid any
settlement, the problem is'one for the student body. Does

it Want or,need a magazine?

Exactly what impressions
were made concerning the group's
purposes and functions is open
to conjecture. But it was all
quite harmless and amusing.

But there comes a point
where it takes more guts and
self-respect to refuse to join
than it may take to join. This
was the case with Honor-G’s
secret initiation Saturday night.

Excuse me for mentioning
such a ridiculous, pretentious
term as ‘ihuman dignity,” but
the details of the Saturday ini-,
tiation are completely imprint»:

The clever costuming of this

previous years. The capacity
audience was ravcrably impres
sed with the fine lighting and

performance a success.

Much credit is due to Don-

by the advisor, Miss Elma

Unique staging was noted in the
