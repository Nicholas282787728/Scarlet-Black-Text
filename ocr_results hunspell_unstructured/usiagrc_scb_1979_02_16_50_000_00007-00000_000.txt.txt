it finally all came together for

the women's basketball team last

weekend, said Coach Cindy
Winkler,

“It was terrificia great way to
end the season . , . it’s nice to be
able toputtogetherall or the things
you've practiced all season. It
never seems you do~but this year
we did "

THE WOMEN'S squad took four
straight gamcs Friday and Sat
urday to win the first Midwest
Conierence championship tour~
nament. The Pioneers clinched the
title with a 5647 victory over Knox.

The Pioneers were led in the
Knox game by junior Kim Krutilla,
who tallied 23 points for a new
Grinnell scoring record.

THE OLD RECORD of 20 points
was set last year by Sarah Erich»
ford, and equalled earlier this
season by Stephanie Nelson. Cue,
Knox and Monmouth all finished
the tourney with 2-2 records while
Cornell lost four straight.

In addition to the Knox victory,
Grinnell beat Monmouth 50-45 in
the opener, after battling back
from a 20—17 halftime deficit. Next
came a 4546 victory over Coe, in
which Brichlord scored 14 points.
Grinnell then trounced Cornell 62-
47 in the second-torthelast game.

THE PIONEERS' tournament
victory came off of a loss earlier in
the Week to Coe, The loss, Krutilla
said, “psyched" the team for the
tourney. “We were ready to play,"
She said. “The embarassing loss to
Coe sobered us up.”

But the joyrgiving effects of the
victory were obvious in an 5&1}
interview with Brichford, Krutilla,
and Nelson. “We're singing and
dancing over the victory," they
said, somewhat in unison.

KRUTTLLA SAID the players
have good reasons to celebrate
since the women‘s team has gone,
in three years, from a team that
played other schools junior-var-
sity teams to a conierence
champion.

Other reasons include' the fact
that all of the starters will be back

next year, the balance evident on
this year's team, and the increased
skills displayed by incoming fresh»
men.

”l'M LOOKING forward to going
into the fourth year of playing. We
now have a sound program behind
us and capable women ready to
play,“ Nelson said.

Brichford said talents on the
team are \vellrbalanced. “No
single person stands out. it's a real
team effort,” she says.

TEAM MEMBER Cathy Sessler
confirms this: “We have a lot of
outstanding people who came
through during the season." .

Beside Brichford. Krutilla, and
Nelson, the team is led by fresh-
men Liz Valenti, who leads the

team’s fast-break, and Monica
Shilling, a 6-4 rebounding and
scoring threat, Both players, ac
cording to Winkler, blossomed in
the second half of the season.

BUT THE THING that makes
Winkler and the team most op-
timistic is the prospect'ol more
talented incoming freshmen.
Women's basketball programs in
many areas are relatively new, but
progress is being made at a rapid
pace. she said.

Winkler says the Midwest
Athletic Conference for Women is
an example. “It took the many,
many years to start up the men's
conference. We’ve put together our
conference in just three years,” he.
says.

Fun, not ‘hype,’ men’s v-ball aim

upcoming tournaments, each team
will play other teams in its
division. The finals Will be held in
April at Graceland College .in
Lamoni.

ALTHOUGH GRTNNELL lost its
three matches last Saturday,
Edwalds said the squad “did well:
considering the competition."
Most of the teams entered in the
tournament grant men’s volleyball
“formal team status and some of
them actually recruit players," he
said.

The volleyball club uas founded
three years ago by Tom Latimcr.
When Latimer resigned at the end
of last year, it was expected the
team would dissolve, said Steve
rernstrom, who has been playing
with the club since it was formed.

FERNSTROM SAID that the
club survives today as a msult of
student participation and Edwald's
efforts as player, coach, and
financier. “If it weren‘t for Eric
the whole thing would have fallen
through,”

Though Edwalds complains of “a
‘lack of a coach, a lack of money
and a lack of a suitable practice
time," he says he is proud oi the
team and says he gets “good
cooperation from the players.“

HIS HIGHEST HOPE is to have
the club recognized as a school
team. He says “now. without a
coach. the prospects are grim."

Unlike other teams who wear the
formal uniform with matching
socks and cxpcnsive sweats,
Grinnell players wear a loose,
comfortable “dashiki” shirt made
ill Pakistan

While the club barely receives
anything more than a small grant
from the SGA “Initiative fund”,
the money tor the new uniforms
was saved from last year's budget.
Edwalds said.

Edwalds says that the learn is
generally satisited with the less
expensive “dashiki” uniforms, on
which he “got a good deal from an
lndian head shop."
