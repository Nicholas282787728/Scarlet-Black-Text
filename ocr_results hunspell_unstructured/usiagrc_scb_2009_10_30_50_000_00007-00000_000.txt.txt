Asian horror films more than multicultural

BY COURTNEY SHEEHAN

This past week, the Asian and Asian American Associa-
tion (AAA) presented an impressive program of horror films,
AAA ofﬁcer Ivy Lee ’10 organized the film festival that fear
tutcd stellar horror flicks “A Tale ofTwo Sisteis,’”Audition,”
“The Host,"“Tetsuo" and “The Eye," which you can still catch
tonight at 8 p.m.Thc ﬁlms were all
shown in the AAA office on the
second floor of the IRC. Howevei,
since Lee had no access to funds in
order to secure distribution rights,
she was unable to legally advertise
the screenings.

Under the umbrella genie name
of Asian horror, the films included in the festival are known
for their psychologically taut, painstakingly suspenseful and
aesthetically inventive qualities. The festival films come spe-
cifically from south Korea, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and
Singapore, offering a nice sampling ofdisrincrive frhnmnking

In addition to serving up fun, frlghts and bad reinakcs, these

Tonight's film, “The Eye,“ tells the tale ofan eye transplant
gone awry When a young blind woman receives a new set of
eyes, the ability to foresee death accompanies her newfound
vision. The creepy film boasts a truly transnational cast and
crew, starring Malaysian—Taiwanese actress Angelica Lee and
Chinese-Canadian actor Lawrence Chou, as well as Singapor—
ean and Thai actors,

As the festival’s organizer and a long-time promoter of
Asian cinema at Grinnell, Lee sees the festival as a way to
develop conceptions of multiculturalism by incorporating
mainstream movies along with distinctly “cultural" films or
documentaries. Along With a few other students, Lee is cur
rently tossing around the idea ofstarting an Asian frlrn library.
“Gtinnell could definitely do with some kind of an expansion
for those underrepresented ﬁlmmakers,” Lee said. Given the
scarcity ofworld cinema in the SGA films line-up. such a lie
brary is called for, as well as more events like Lee's horror fest.

French films offer language, culture, candy

BYEMILYBAJET

This year, Griniiell's new French Assistant Magali Leimi—
genux hopes to use her newly renamed “French Cinema Club"
to help both French and non-French speakers come into a better
understanding of French culture. Although last year's French as
sistant Laurie Wilcox also hosted weekly movie viewings, Lermi—
geaux has made changes to the club’s fonnariing that she hopes
will encourage more people to attend and appreciate die beauty
of French cinema.

“If students want to know more about French cinema, which
is a very old and traditional culnirai aspect of France, these
movies are a good start,” Lermigeaux said.
Lermigeaux will be showing as string of
critically acclaimed ﬁlms including those
by Francois Tnitfaut, Jeaanuc Godard and
Jacques Rivette, who were seen as the lead
ets of the 60's “New Wave" (Nouvelle Vague)
cinema.

The ﬁlms thus far have ranged from sub»
jeet matter varying between Ozon‘s murder
mystery “Hui! Femmes", which stars eight of
France’s most famous actresses, to Truffaut’s
“Le Dernier Metro", which deals with Germany's occupation of
France during WWII. An interesting ﬁlm to look forward to is
Catherine Breillat's ‘ZAnatomie de I’Enfer", which has the quirky
perk ofstam'ng an actual porn star, Rocco Sift’redi.

In light of last year’s poor attendance Lermigeaux has made
several changes to the French ﬁlm series. “This year it's differ-
ent because I wrote down when there’d be subtitles or not so
non French speakers could attend, and I changed the days and
I changed the locations [between] French house and ARH, dev
pending on the popularity of the movie," Lermigeaux said.

Besides the ﬁlms being more accessible to students outside of
the French department, Lermigeaux said she vim-its show ﬁlms
that are intellectually stimulating and represent the diversity of

Fiench cinema culture.

As fol French students who don't feel comfortable with the
idea of desperately trying to understand mpidly spoken French
while seated next to a native French speaker leisurely watching
and understanding die ﬁlm, Lenuigeaiix believes that attending
the club and hearing French being spoken in a natural setting as
opposed to inside a classroom will help tremendously with their
immersion to the language.

“Watching movies is the easiest way to acquire culture, back
ground, historical viewpoints, vocabulary and help with syntax
and pronunciation all in one row, by just seating in a room eating

candies for two hours," said Lei-migeaux, who
provides snacks for all who attend.

Kyle Walters ’12, who has not taken
French during his time at Grinnell, notes
that, “most of the people who go to these

. movies are not French majors. Some oftliem
are nan'verFrench speakers, but certainly not
all French majors," he said

Aldrough Walters took seven years of
French prior to attending Grinntll, he still
believes non—French speakers would more

than welcome at an entirely French film series, as he said they
seemed very low key

San Kittleson'lZ also attended French movie night after be-
ing recommended by a friend and would recommend it to students
not involved in the French program, “It was a good atmosphere,
even Lhoughl don't speak French," Kittleson said. “I was a little bit
worried about that, but it was fun.”

No matter the film genre or number of students who attend~
French speaking or otherwishLemiigeauxwill continue to show
these weekly ﬁlms at least as a reprieve from the anxiety felt by
many a Grinnell student.

Grinntll is so stressriii in many ways one should not forget
that learning and having fun. learning and pleasure can come (0*
