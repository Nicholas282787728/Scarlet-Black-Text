Chin marvels. “The great thing in

'1 bis week SGA had Supervisoi Sergeant
Darrell Lamb from the Grinnell Police-
Department as a guest speaker. The SGA
asked Sergeant Lamb to clariiy the mail
myths held by the students concernin
laws and rights. A common misconception
is that students have special privileges
while on campus. Sergeant Lamb clariiied
this misconception by stating that all the
laws apply to both students and citizens.
He also stated that the police are not look-
ing to harass students. but are there to
help in any way possible

He also cautioned women on campus to
be careful when jogging at night He sug-
gested that either they jog during the day,
or jog in groups oi two or three. Sergeant
Lamb said that with the Grinnell popula
tion at 5.0m, the police can not be near
campus at all times. and they would ape
preciate any information provided by the
students relating to any crime or com-
plaint, Sergeant Lamb. who has been on
the police force ior the past 17 years.
linished his talk by saying that there has
been a good relationship between the
police department and the college and
hopes that this will continue through the
years

There was a prolonged debate by the

The othei major crisis lacing
