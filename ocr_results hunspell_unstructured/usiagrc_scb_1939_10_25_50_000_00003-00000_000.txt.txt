Blackballed Coed Preps Collect
Stage Props for Mass Meeting

“Do I have to wear it?" queue
Mabel Rodger as She dug a calm
plete football uniform cut of the
equipment room of the men's
gym. “Do 1 have to drag it?”
quavered Fran Under-hill, deposits
ing the little wagon which she
picked up, not even the Honor
“G" knows where. “Do I have to
carry that thing around?" won-
dered Patty Bruce, wincing at
sight of the old black umbrella,
Chamberlain style,

These three and about eight
others were blackballed. Unluckyl
girls, they tried to make their
betterrbehaved classmen believe.
Unhappy? They gloried in their
“duties." But did they know
why? They did not. Even While
glorying they quavered.

Along with the suit, the um-
brella and the wagon, these little
ones who were "too reluctant to
stoop," or lacked interest in
gathering up reserve books, laun—
dry bags and mail, or maybe were
just plain “sassy," gathered
leaves, bathing suits, and gym
equipment from dumbhelis to roll-
er skates. '

They cancelled dates, lessons and
letters, and all of them tore out
to do their duty by the old black-
ball. ‘AS to the purpose of all
this agony, they were in the dark.
But not for long. The mass meet-
ing Monday night cleared up all
their doubts. For lo and behold.
on the stage there appeared as
costumes, properties, and stage
effects, all the little odds and
ends the awful blackball de-
manded of them.

According to Frances Mott,
president of the Women's Honor
'G," this hlackballing is “not
disheartening. More girls are for
getting their duties every day.”

Homecoming Play
Causes Purchase

Of New LigI‘lI's

Because the homecoming play,
“Our Town," had no stage sets,
an entire new set of lights has
been purchased to crcatc the cor»
rect atmosphere for the scenes,
Sara Sherman Pryor, director of
drama, announced recently.

The lighting, costumes, and
dialogue take the place of sets in
the presentation of Thornton
Wilder's play, which calls for so
different costumes of the period
around 1900, Mrs. Pryor said.

Rehearsals are in the fourth
week, and most of the technical
difficulties of the production
have been solved with the addi
tion of the new lights, according
to Mrs. Pryor.
