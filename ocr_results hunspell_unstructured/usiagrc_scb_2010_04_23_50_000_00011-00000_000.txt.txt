Representation for
off-campus senators

» In an uncharacteristic move ofthis year’s Joint Board, the
vote to add another senator to the OCCO/OCNCO cluster
failed in this past week's Joint Board. We at the sen: sup
port the move to itdd another senator to this cluster. due in
large part to the number ofstudents per capita assigned to an
OCCO/OCNCO senator. ,

If anything. offscarnpus senators have a heavier workload
than on-campus senators. Nor only do off-campus students
live all over Grinnell, but also abroad, as students taking a se-
mester abroad fall under the off-campus cluster. The task of
organizing dozens ofstudents who live within a few hundred
feet ofeach other and their senators is difficult enough—hung
ine that except the students live all over the town and dozens
ofcountncs outside the us. Why current off-campus senators
should be required to represent more students with a wider
area of residence makes no sense. If anything, with an addi»
tional senator, that senator could focus their duties on keeping
students living abroad informed and involved.

Furthermore, there is essentially no drawback to adding
another senator to the off-campus pool. As an unpaid posi—
tion, the only overhead cost of a fourth senator would be a
few cents extra for whatever meals, snacks, etc. are provided for
Joint Board. And maybe the labor required to pull up an extra

A call for intentional community in

gender neutral housing on campus

After years ofstudenr activism and administrative engages
ment, gender neutral housing at Grinncll has grown from a
handful ofsingles on Loose second south to encompass 10%
of all college~ownecl housing. To better serve trans, gender
nonconforming, genderqueer, and trans ally students, student
Affairs and Residence Life has expanded room draw alongside
the growing needs ofour community. Next year, gender neutral
housing will be offered in Loose South, all of Rawson, Cowles
Apartments, Cowles 1st, Lazier 1st, project houses, language
houses, and mini co-ops. '

students who feels that-living on a gender neutral ﬂoor
is a necessity for safety, comfort, or other reasons may email
Laura Gogg [gogglaull and request gender neutral housing if
they feel uncomfortable outing themselves through the regular
room draw process. You also have the opportunity to live on a
gender neutral ﬂoor ifyou have an interest in supporting and
sustaining a floor community that is safe and affirming of all
gender identities and expressions. Choosing to live in gender
neutral housing makes a statement about the type ofcommuni-
ty you want to live in. Student Affairs can only assign physical
spaces with a gender neutral label. From there, students must
work to create the ethos that drives this safe space.

As gender neutrality becomes further institutionalized on
campus, we’re conﬁdent a more intentional gender neutral
community will develop organically. However, as we continue
to learn about what it means to sustain a gender neutral ﬂoor
and support housing options that are more equitable, safe, and
comfortable for all students, it’s essential that we actively en-
gage in this process.Wc encourage all those interested in living
in gender neutral housing to sign up during room draw and to
direct questions and comments to [rag], [srecnter] or [ajust].

chair at lointBoard sessions. Regardless, there are essentially no
drawbacks. it seems the only drawback in some senator’s minds
might be the dilution of current voices in a meeting with one
extra person. But isn’t that extra senator just a re
flcction of the democratic principles of SGA?

in short, it doesn't make sense ro have fewer
senators representing offvcampus, per capita,
than anywhere else on campuwar least one
senator should be added to the off-campus
representation to balance out Joint Board and
senatorial duties. Unfortunately, since this decision
has been thrown back to'the committee, will not he resolved
this semester, and cannot be brought back to the table until af—
ter senator elections have happened next fall, any modification
will likely not rake effect until Spring semester 2011. But that's
no reason to avoid the issues. Heed our call, Joint Board, and

TO THE EDITOR

Please respect smokers’ personhood

My name is Stephen Walkiew'icz and I am smoker (of cigar
rcttcs you dirty ﬂower ﬂingers). Now as you know, Grumell, this
otherwise incidental fact of my personal life would generally
held litdc or no signiﬁcance as a measure ofwlio I am or how I
and others identify myself. However, a recent law, specifically the
Iowa smoke-Free Air act, has radically changed the effects of
this fact upon my life, Bur before I go any further I would like to
point out that I would never presume to challenge the idealistic
logic ofthe law: that smoking is detrimental not only to smokers
bur to those around them, and that non-smokers shouldn't have
to suffer other people's willing choice to expose themselves to
dangerous substances. That I believe is a viable case to be made.
However, I can say that for myself the way in which this law has
come to be enacted has had troubling effcets upon the place ofa
smoker in their own home (here at Grinnell) and personal space.
Although I don’t necessarily disagree with the intended ends of
the law (to discourage smoking),l do find the way in which it is
managed to be extraordinarily problematic, and quite honestly,
mildly oppressive in its subtle violation of personal space, caregor
rization ofindividual identity, and marginalization ofsmokers.

Have I gone too far? Am I wrongly conflating myselfwith
marginalized others so that I may indulge my selﬁsh desire to be
one of the "glorious oppressed?"l don’t believe so, Grinnell. My
training here in the humanities never ceases to remind me of my
privileged status which so often demands rigorous attention to
its dangerous historic and symbolic value. Yet my training is still
telling me that something is wrong with this law and the my
in which it makes its presence known, not only on this campus,
but also in my mind. Its mandates have caught my conscience,
effectively subjecting me to constanr paranoia as an Other. It has
effectively inﬁltrated a part of my Life and categorizcd me as a
smoker in order to name and regulate me as a problem that is an
abnormality which should be considered a threat to the integrity
ofrhc system. I've been branded, shunned and exiled,

“0b, get over yourself," you might say. But look at the logic
and look at the procedure. We've been told that security has its
ever watchful eye out for smokers And will quickly bring us to

page 10). The main goal of Real Men is to spread amreness

lions is admirable.

one aspect of Real Men that will benefit the campus com—
munity is a mandatory workshop planned for incoming male
athletes. By doing ﬂiis, almost a third of incoming male sru»
dents will receive educarion on sexual assault before they even
begin classes. Taking an hour or so out ofNew Student Orien-
tation is a small cost for an essential and eyeropening experi—
ence that beneﬁts both the students involved and the campus
as a whole. -

Along with other workshops for the entire campus coma
munity, Real Men will hopefully lay some groundwork for
other students to form additional groups that will appeal to
specific populations in order to further create a campus where
a higher number of individuals will feel safe. Good job, Real
Men. Keep doing the right thing.

the authority of a judicial committee should we violate the law
by smoking on campus. Now, when lighting up, that ever prev
ent judicial eye gazes through at us from the very confines of
our now paranoid mindsThat gaze differentiates us from others,
making us aberrations ofthc law who have no space as an identi-
fied smoker on campus, A smoker is now a smoker by the au-
thoritative naughty no-uc linger oflawful classification. we are
therefore literally pushed to the periphery of our own domain,
forced to smoke far from the center ofcampus to the edge ofan
arbitrarily delineated spacc.The effect ofrhis arbitrary delineas
tron only serves to supplement our confusion, never really leaving
us at peace of mind as to whether or not we are in accordance
with the law. The ill-deﬁned center of the acceptable Grinnell
student is now denied to us in a subtle wayl had to chuckle at
those innocent smoker's outpost when I realized that the barbar-
ian the outpost was installed to prevent from entering the state
was none other than myself. Where once I thought nothing of
identifying myself as a smoker, I am now made constantly aware
of (he “erroneous" behavior I’ve adopted and the necessity to hide
my abjecrion from the public eye in the dangerous no man’s land
between speeding car and glass riddled curb.

Listen Grinnell, I’m not trying to blow smoke up your ass or
in your face. I understand that it is a ﬁlthy habit that may have
the potential to harm others (thanks for reminding me The State
of Iowa, I forgot to lead a citizen’s dutiful life) and by no means
do I wish to have the right to smoke around those who would
prefer I not do so. All I’m saying is that I feel the my in which
the law is enforced has made me feel violated and marginalized,
and that perhaps there are better ways to arbitrate the law so that
all parties have a free voice in the affair, and furthermore, so that
smokers and noncsmokers can live together in communicative
and empathetic ways. Can’t I just sit in my favorite spot in the
middle of a field when no ones around and indulge myself in
my own foolish vice> A vicc that is my LEGAL right to choose.
Dearest Grinnell, don't reach me to think outside ofrhe lines of
what's proper and then expect rue to be dumb and silent as I am
condemned to be defined there.
