BV BROOKE LANSDALE

With as each and the Prnnyraoer in
hand, Julia Nierengrten ‘05 and I hit
the town; we were going garage saling.

The competent Grinnell students
that we are, it only took us 15 minutes
to search through the IOspage Penny-
mwr to find the map of local garage
sales (Be sure not to overlook the sup»
plemental sections of the paper it’you
try this at home.)

Looking at the Pannyraoer- map, we
hit another obstacle. Our 810 activity
was supposed to be for Saturday after»
noon after you’ye decided you can read
that whole novel and

write that eight-page “which leg

. ‘ dr . .
$3.32. on Sun 3’ chickenls

The problem with der, the left or the

our plan? Like every rig ht?"
thing else in Grinnell,

garage sales close ii-
diculously early: inosr-
start at 8 arm. and end
at noon.

For early risers, there are also some
that start at 7 am, although I'm not
sure the sun is even up then, so you
might want to bring a ﬂashlight with
you to help you find your way.

Friday is probably the best time to
hit these sales, since most start around
noon and run until sometime in the
evening.

In spite of this prohlern, Julia and I
were able to ﬁnd one garage sale on the
south side ottlic trackswt cagerlyope
proached the large folding tables deco—
mting the sellers’ front yard.

An old fashioned (Linker Oats box,
an upside down Seven-Up pint glass
with a thin neck and large bottom, kids’
playing cards, sewing machine parts,
music tapes, a carousel horse, a large

ﬁTrivialPL/rsui't, 5150-

Gone with the Wind commemorative
tin With so many choices, it was
hard to settle on just a few items

we went with the gigantic wooden
fork and spoon for 33, the tape titled
“Rockin’ Instrumentals" for 3.25, and a
zip lock bag of junk for 31. That left us
with 55.75 to spend.

we popped our new rocleincassettc
into the ear tape player and went down
town to spend the rest of our money.
The thrift stores downtown are always
fun and have a pretty good selection or
stuff, so we headed for Main Street.

At Phase 2, Julia splurgcd and
picked out a cute Ts
shirt for a substantial
$3.50. Then at Rags
and Riches] found
a 1984 edition of
Trivial Pursuit for

ofthe
more ten’

Sure, most of the
questions were a on
before lny time, as
I was only one when the game came
out, But sonic questions remain times
less. For example. “Which of the ﬁve
senses are you most likely to lose ifhit
by lightning?" oi “Which leg or the
chicken is more tender, the left or the
right?"

Not including tax, since as noir
math majors we cannot subtract or add
any nunilaers not ending in five or zero,
we were left with 875.

Standing outside the thrift stores,
just a few feet from the pub, w: brain—
stormed what to do with our leftover
quarters.Then it hit us! We walked into
the Democratic headquarters and made
a generous $.75 donation to the Kerry
campaign.

And in case you were wondering:
your hearing and the left leg.
