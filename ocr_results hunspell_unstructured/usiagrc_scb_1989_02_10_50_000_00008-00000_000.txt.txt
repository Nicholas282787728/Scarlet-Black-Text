Grinnell Invitational exhi it

reviewed

by Dan Capone

The current Grinnell Invilar
tional has got to be one of the
more exciting shows to come to
the Grinnell Community Art
Gallery during my four years
here. It works hard and effec-
tively to dispel the college-centric
attitude held by many that the
little bit of art there is in Grin-
neIl, is all being done on cam-
pus. the southwest corner of
campus.

The show is comprised of the
work of 35 artists, all from
Grinnell, working in a wide range
of media. Upon entering the
gallery. one is faced with a host
of objects, from watercolors to
knitted sculptures and everything
in between.

A few of the objects call
particular attention to them-
selves. or at least caught my at-
tention as I walked through. The
first work I noticed. and one I
kept coming back to, was Maria
Mootry's acrylic painting,
Generations. The work is emo-
tionally vibrant, the predominant
pinks softened with blues and
greens and mixed-in whites. The
figures, reminiscent of some of
Gaugin's. stand against a Ma-
tisselike wallpaper. Intense red
flowers, or rather a very thick
passage of paint we read as ﬂow-
ers, stand out, even in compari-
son to the already-saturatedrwith»
red background.

Generations by Maria Mootry.

Another artist whose works
caught my attention was Netia
Worley, Her watercolor and
aquarelle on wood compositions
need little explaining, but they
are fascinating in the way she
uses the wooden surface. In both
10th Avenue at Sunset and First
Light, the wooden surface pro-
vides not only a background, but
also lends support to the work.
Worley exploits the wood‘s ab-
sorbent properties for expressive
effects. such as the evocative
manner in which she captures the
last pale-yellow glimpse of day
being overtaken by the blueeblack
night in 10m Avenue at Sunset.

In First Light. the wood back-
ground is exploited even further,
it's grain used to suggest the
rows and furrows of the field.
The swirling, dynamic textural
quality of this latter work is
somewhat in opposition to the

calmer, softer effect achieved in
the former,

William and Ilse Case‘s Wet—
terstet'n. Germany pieces provide
an interesting pair of images.
Ilse Case’s linocut is based on
William Case’s photograph of a
country road in Germany. The
linocut is essentially faithful to.
the photograph, yer departs from
it in that the angle of the road is
changed, and the textures so
wonderfully captured by the pho—
tograph are diagramatically ren~
dered. The overall effect of the
two is captivating and engaging,
and provides some insight into
the differences between the ex-
pressive possibilities of two dis
tinct media in the portrayal of the
same subject.

There are many other works
worth seeing: Jill Schrift's
whimsical, lighthearted Good and
Plenty porcelain pieces; Gary
“The Headquarters”
Falling Star wooden quilt block
piece; Ming Yang's Oriental wa-
tercolors; and too many others to
mention.

The show runs through Feb.

Culture Corner

by Jill Petty

In an era of Fatal Attractions
and Eastwick Witches and
Working Girls, is it possible to
find positive images of strong
and/or feminist women at your
local movie theatre/college
auditorium/video store? "Ye seek
and ye shall find," especially
outside of Grinnell city limits.

Over Xmas break I
rediscovered stuff comparable to
real Chinese food: two films
about women that didn't make
me want to hunt down directors.
screenwriters, film chairs, errant
actresses (“she must have been
crazy to make 7 that 85!. . . “)
These movies were especially
subtle and critical, addressing the
unusual choices two women
made for spiritual survival.

If you are fortunate enough to
have access to a VCR, check
these out: Housekeeping, directed
by Bill Forsyth. starring
Christine Lahti; and Mrs. Saffel,
directed by Gillian Armstrong,
featuring Diane Keaton (and a
haunting soundtrack by Mark
Isham,)

Mrs. Sa/fel is not a perfect
movie. The unlikely love story
between Keaton and Mel Gibson
falters a bit, although it is at
times lyrical. But the most
interesting relationships are
between Keaton and her family.
Mrs. Soffel is based on a true
turn»of-lhe-eentury story: a
Pittsburgh prison wardcn’s wife
aids and joins the escape of two
brothers from death row. In the
movie, the tensions between Mr.
Soffel (played by Edward
Hermann) and his wife might
have been more thoroughly
explored—some scenes between
Hermann and Keaton seem
truncated. From the beginning,
however, it is clear that the
“freedom" she recently enjoyed
during a period of bed rest has
been lost—Mr. Soffel instead at-
tempts to use her frailty, or what

he calls her “instability.“ as
another way to control her.

She rebels in small ways
(perhaps her illness itself was a
rebellious act) but is frustrated by
the restrictive roles of upright
wife and devoted mother. The
way the scenes in the Soffel
home are shot (tight. up close)
further dramatize her caged ex—
istence; we are trapped with her
in those heavily upholstered
rooms.

The only tasks that take Mrs.
Soffel away from her prison
(which is, coincidentally, attached
to the one her husband officially
runs) are daily Scripture readings
to the inmates. Ironically, she
meets Gibson and his brother
(Matthew Modine) while lec-
turing on sin. Wide-open shots
of wintry Pennsylvania
landscapes and bittersweet
lovemaking punctuate their
escape until they are captured and
brought back.

Mrs. Saffei is not a great
movie, While Gibson is
captivating (no pun intended) and
Keaton intense, the movie is
without focus. Part of the
problem may be Armstrong’s
direction; her first film, My
Brilliant Career was a
spontaneous art-film hit, its
theme more directly “feminist.“

Mrs. 50]er was written for a
larger audience, and Armstrong’s
original vision for the movie
may have been muddied. But
because it is based on facts, it is
hard to criticize the punitive
though inevitable ending; Mrs.
Soffel finally finds freedom in an
unlikely spot.
