Remembering children living in poverty

As many of you know, my wife (Lucy) just gave
birth to our second daughter, Kaia (pronounced IGvya,
rrom the Greek for earth) Palmer Chang Roper. we
went into the hospital on Friday morning (3:30 am)
and came home on Sunday both Kala and Lucy are
doing well. on Tuesday, Kaia actually slept through
part of the night, which was welcome. She makes
funny faces and only Mr
casionauy opens her eyes,
She mostly sleeps and
nurses

She makes me laugh
and my heart ache with
joy. i couldn't be happier
or more proud. lam blessed.

I have awonderful family in addition to a reward
ing career, and I look forward to watching my two
daughters grow up to be happy and healthy adults. I
am truly privileged and am grateful for my circum
stances.

In the shantytown of Alto do Cruzeiro in North-
east Brazil, there is a high expectancy orinfant death,
The average woman experiences 9.5 pregnancies, 3.5
child deaths, and 1.5 still births. As a kind ofcoping
strategy, childien who are born weak, underweight or
show difﬁculties nursing are often identified with one
of several folk terms for “hopeless child".

They are expected to die, and so their parents do
not invest in them. After they are let to die, they are
buried without religious ceremony or tears in “n,
marked graves, where they will join a multitude of
other such Victims. They will not likely be visited
again.‘

While the Situation faced by mothers in Alto do
Crilzeiro is extreme, its juxtaposition With my own
serves to highlight the stark contiasts between the
privileges that I enjoy and the extreme poverty faced
by many in the world. Over 1 biuion people in the
world live in extreme poverty 7 a situation character-

ized by intense insecurity, the signiﬁcance of which is
often exposed in the process ofchild birth and infant
care.

My privilege is exposed in the fact that Lucy is
now home 7 healthy and happy, though exhausted.
I have a good job with excellent beneﬁts (thanks
Grinnell couegel), and we had easy access to modern

medical technology before,
during and after the births.
While some may lament
the medicallzation/mods
ernization of the natural
birth, I was glad for the
option. Lucy needed sur-
gery after Phoenix was born and medical attention
again after Kaia was born,

we were never ncivous, however, and the pro-
cedures seemed quite routine. This would not have
been the case in many parts of the world. Over half
a million women die each year from complications
during pregnancy and childbiith, while 10 million
are seriously injured or disabled. This is primarily
because they lack access to health systems, medicines
and medical professionalsz.

I enjoy my privilege in the health of my daugh-
ter, and the comfort that she has a very good chance
to remain healthy. 1 have a good salary, which pres
vides the means to ensure adequate food,clothing and
healthcare

I have insurance and ﬁnancially secure family
members in the case that we experience misfortune or
tragedy I have only mild concern for the safety ot’our
water supply and enjoy excellent sanitation facilities.

Kaia has begun her immunization programs
and Will have l’Cgllllll access to doctors, dentists and
ophthalmologists. Largely outside my bubble, over
30,000 children under the age of five die every day
7 almost 11 million per year, Most live in low ins
come countries uiid die from a combination of mal—

nutrition, preventable diseases and lack of treatments
for things as basic as diarrhea}.

Moderate to severe undersnurrition is experienced
by about onesth‘ird of the world's children, and 11 per—
cent are wasting“. In 2002, 1.4 million children under
the age of five died of preventable diseases including
500,000 by measles, nearly 400,000 by Hib, nearly
300g000 by pertussis, and 180,000 by neonatal teta-
nus (all ofwhich are covered in our vaccinations).

1 am proud new rather of a beautiful and healthy
baby girl. My fortune, however, extends beyond the
body of this little miracle, and includes the circumr
stances ‘in which I find myself that enable me to have
so many choices — to reduce my and my daughter’s
insecurity and to be able to look forward to the likelis
hood of a long, huppy, and healthy life for my family
We should all be so fortunate.
