HAVE LENGTHY OPEN FORUM

Following Foniiill Debate the Air
Fleet Sulisllly Question is Dis-
cussed From Fllmr of House.

Grinnell's debaters made a favors
able impression in the return debate
with Knox held at Calcsbuig Thurs-
day night. James Work, Randolph
Hewitt and Robert Burlinganie, the
Grinnell men, upheld the negative of
the proposition, "Resolved, that the
United states should subsidize its
commercial air fleet," both in an inc
teresting forensic clash and a well-r
ceived open forum discussion.

In tiie Knox debaters Crinncll went
up against three well-trained, logical
speakers. The case of the Galesburg
men rested on three facts: first, that
there were certain evils in the present
system; second, that the proposed
subsidy would remedy these evils;
third, that the subsidy was practic—
able. Coach Beem's men took them
on each of these points and scored a
decided hit by the ease with which
they adapted their arguments to meet
those presented by the Knox men.

Work Opens Case '

Work opened the case for the neg-
ative by showing that there was no
need for a subsidy. He defined the
subsidy as meaning a “direct subs
slay,” and outlawed such government-
al aid as landing fields, weather re-
ports, and regulations such as the
government makes for all industries.
He showed the development of the
postal air service as an example of
what the present system was accom-
plishing, and declared that a subsidy
would cause an unhealthy, mushroon
growth that in the long run would he
detrimental.

Hewitt came directly to the army
incnt by declaring that the subsidy
would not and could not work. He
mentioned conditions in France, where
the subsidy is increasing year by
year, and in England, where the re-
sult of the subsidy was. government
ownership and operation; and asked
the affirmative which type of subsidy
they proposed. He pointed out that
corruption had always followed in the
wake of governmental subsidies, and
showed that the proposed subsidy of
a commercial air fleet could not avoid
this corruption. This was Hewitt’s
first appearance in a. varsity debate.

Burlingame Sums Up Argument

Burlingaine closed the argument of
the negative by showing that the
principle of the subsidy is wrong. He
stated that the principle of American
government was one of “laissez-faire"
and showed that private enterprise
succeeded best when least interfered
with. He declared that if there was a
real demand for a commercial air
fleet, the present system would meet
it, following the economic law of sup-
ply‘ and demand. Burlingame ended
his discussion with a recapitulation of
the negative case.

The open forum was one of the most
interesting features or the evening.
According to a telegram received by
Coach Beem, which was read before
chapel by Dean Nollen Friday mornr
ing, the open forum lasted until eleven
o'clock, and the Grinnell men upheld
their proposition against all comers.
The debate was held heiore a lunch-
eon club, and was especially well at-
tended.

Clark Hall Pride Is
Champ Charlestoner

Word was received late last night
from the finals of the Crinncll
Charleston Contest to the effect that
Evahn, Pride of Clark Hall again cop—
ped the honors.

The contest was reported to have
been a thrilling one featuring, many
famous contestants including hliiscle
Bound Taylor of Hall Three, in Cuta
Harrington of Clark Hall, Nicklerliir
the-Slot Norton of Hall Four, and
Charlie Greene, the Symbol of Sll»
encc. Second and third p zcs were
awarded to Taylor and Harrington.

Bill Mart, manager of the strand
theatre and promoter of the contest,
considers the event entirely success»
ful and will start repairs on the stage
floor innnediatel . Joe Murchellino
local shoe repairer: is looking for
ward to a busy week.

The audience contributed much to
the gaiety of the occasion and were
consistently generous with applause.

The contest has undoubtedly done a
great thing in putting Clark Hall on
the map, and the name "Evahn" will
probably become nationally known
soon. It is reported that the winner
modestly refused the twenty dollars
cash prize on the basis that he didn‘t
earn it. He is also declining requests
for his photograph.

John Brown’s Griulicll Visit.

"Kickshaws," a play by Roma
will he a leading feature
ol the February Tanager, according to
a statement made today by Tanager
editors. This play, adapted from a
story by James Branch Cabell, is to
be presented February 12 by the Eur
perimental theater.

"John Brown in Gl'inuell” is the ti-
tle of an article in which Mi Flor-
ence Kerr recounts vi dly the visit of
the abolitionist leader to this city in
1859. “His welcome in Grinnell was
warm and enthusiastic." writes Mrs.
Kerr. “The party was so large that
attempts at concealment were use-
less, and Brown depended for safety.
so long as he traveled by wagons, up—
on the party’s fighting ability. The
mounted guards were armed with six«
shooters."

Other contents of the February
Tanager are an article on Carl Sand—
burg, by Rose Cero, stories by Loren
Reid and Frank Dewey, and verse by
John Kearns, Wayne Card, and Lucile
McMui-ray. John Kearns, known wide—
ly as a magazine writer, was one of
the founders of the American Poetry
Magazine.

The issue of the Tanager to be dis«
tributed next week is forty per cent
larger than the previous issue. Its
typographical appearance is enhanced
by the use in heads of Garamond
type, bought especially for this pur-
pose. This type is a. modern version
of a letter attributed to the noted type
designer, Claude Caramond, who
flourished in France about 1510.
