"Comparable to attacks against any
minorities," commented Jim Tederman,
Vice President and Dean. of Student Af-
fairs. about the recent posting of
homophobic iliers and posters on campus
bulletin boards, The posters were also
mailed anonymously to members of the
Human Resource Center, as well as. to
several students with no affiliation to
either the Center or GCGC.

The three diiierent posters parodied
GCGC fliers. They included an advertise-
ment for Rock Hudson as convocation
speaker on AIDS and another which in»
structed parents to shoot their gay sons,

Tederman supports all students‘ rights
to free speech but condemned the
homophobic nature oi the posters and the
anonymous mailing as "reprehensible ,
itstrikes at the heart oi’ the academic com-
munity "

Torn Crady, Associate Dean of Student
Affairs. added that the violent slogans of
one of the posters are alarming. “when
violent sentiments are expressed we are
especially concerned.” said Crady,

Tederman stated that the singling out of
gays was particularly serious because of
the college's ariirmative action policy.
"This campus chose to give sexual
preierence protected status and we must
uphold this.” said Tederman.

Both Tederman and Julie Fraser. 3
Resident Adviser and a member of the
Human Resource Center Advisory Come
mittee, said that attempts to trace the per-
son or persons responsible ior the posters
have been frustrating. Crady stated.
however. that progress was being made.

“We are working on this every day and
are taking various measures to find
whoever did this.” Crady said. He declined
to reveal these methods ior fear oi jeopar~
dizing the investigation

Tederman and Fraser encourage
students with information to come forward
and stress that any disclosures will be
treated as strictly confidential.

“Whoever did this had obviously spent a
lot of time making the posters and perhaps
a student saw them being put up,” said
Fraser,

Hands-'AcroSs—Grinnell:

Student Survey

by Kristen Stromberg

Despite the fact that anti~homosexual
propaganda has been on the rise recently,
student opinion does not seem to support
this movement. Most students expressed
concern about the problem and responded
with comments like “it’s unfortuante and
an indication of narrow-mindedness that
should not be found at an institution like
Grinnell" and that the recent irrational
posters and destructive graffiti are inconr
sistent with Grinnell values,

Although homophobia was “scary as
hell” to some people, other people were
unaware of it. “It hasn’t hit me yet" was a
fairly common response, as was ”it’s to be
expected,” One freshman believed that a
prurhomosexual attitude was developing
among the people he knew.

While students were outspoken in their
criticism of homophobia, they were
cautious with other gay issues such as
marriage and adoption oi children.

“l have probelms with it, but I don’t
think it’s for me to choose what other peo-
ple do,“ commented one sophomore.

Students with more conservative at»
titudes expressed “serious reservations”
about marriage and adoptions, because of
the possible “deleterious effect on the
nuclear family," the nuclear family being
considered the fabric that binds our sociee
ty together.

However, it was the ability of the
parents to provide a loving, supportive
home for the children and not the sex of the
parents which determined the attitudes of
most people. “The most important thing is
that the home be stable, ” a student
remarked.

Some people worried about the effect
homosexual parents can have on children.
though the response “I think that because
heterosexual parents can have homosex-
ual children, homosexual parents Should
be able to have heterosexual children,”
was representative.

Most Grinnell students do not blame the
AIDS crisis on homosexuals: “how can
you blame someone for a disease?m Those
people who citedhomosexual promiscuity
as a factor in the spread of AIDS even con-
ceded that it was often spread by drug-

A Call for Campus Unity

by David Tanenhaus

Sunday afternoon. November 9, at 3:30
p.m., nearly titty Grinnell students
gathered in the cold at central campus ior
HandSeAcross-Grinnell, This event was
sponsored by the newlyropened Gay and
Human Resource Centers to unite people
and to tierup their first week of activities,

The scene was reminiscent of the new
games that took place during new student
days, as the people joined hands and form-
ed a straight line and shouted to passers-
by, ”more people, more people," After
stretching the human chain across a large
portion oi central campus the participants
linked in a circle and started to run

around. A small dog even joined in by run-
ning along side the students, barking,

A low minutes later the group stood link.
ed in a circle. while an adviser to the
center, Bill Turner. stood in the middle
and asked if there were questions. There
was little response, but at the end. the
students gave a threecheers shout for the
resource center.

"I wtsh there were more people. l’m
happy that it got people together, so that
we could share iniormation with people
who did not know much about the Gay and
Human Resource Centers,” said Steven
Jones, an advisor to the center.

Homophobla on Campus

Students
Respond

by May-lee Chai

The third in a series of homophobic let-
ters that have assailed members oi the gay
community, the Human and Gay Resource
Centers committees, as well as students
unrelated to any of those associations,
brought the issue oi homophobia on cam-
pus into the spotlight recently.

The letters, which have become increas
ingly more violent and abusive in nature,
prompted the administration to act.
Notices were posted calling for all students
with any information as to the authorts) of
the letters to come forward.

The campus community has responded
with mixed reactions — many students ex
pressed outrage although the anonymous
homophobic graffiti in the restrooms cone
tinues unabated.

“It seems people m non-gays — are per-
sonally outraged," said Beth Johnson, an
outspoken member oi the Grinnell College
Gay Community who has been a frequent
victim of the homophobic mail campaign.
“There is a feeling that if gays can be
targeted and harassed, then who‘s next?"

Senior RJ. Baker, a member of the Gay
and Human Resource Committee, feels
that the number of homophobic graffiti
and acts 7 although not necessarily the
tone — are “about the same” as in the
past. However. he added that “one thing
that is changing is that we as gay people
are realizing that there are such things as
gay civil rights."

Although the October 29 concert featur~
ing a gay political folksinging group seems
to have prompted the third letter, there
are no plans to stop bringing such
awarenessrbuilding events to campus, ac
cording to Baker.

Next semester Baker said plans are
underway to begin a Wednesday night
series of movies that are “just going to
have a character who happens to be gay”
in them.

“They will not specifically be about a
gay relationship," he said, although Art
Jolly. member of the Gay and Human
Resource Centers committee. added that
they ”are not going to be limited in that
respect."

Several of the movies that are planned
have been suggestions students put in the

Faculty
Votes on
Admission
Policy

by Dave Jones

On Monday November to, the faculty
passed legislation setting up a policy ior
admissions to Grinnell College. “What we
gained is a way ior our office to oiriciaily
say these factors now are going to be taken
into account when we look at a student,“
Said John Hopkins, Director of Admission,

Ranked first as a criterion in the admis»
sions process will be scholastic perfor-
mance. This category is broken down into
two subdivisions, secondary school pertorr
mance and standardized test results.
Following scholastic performance are, in
order, promise of contribution to the col-
lege community, maintenance of a multi-
racial and multicultural community, and
geographical distribution.

Originally, the policy contained as its
first criterion only secondary school per-
iormcnce but this was changed by an
amendment proposed by Gerald Lalonde,
a member of the Admission Board.
Although in the ranking system standar-
dized test results are place above pro-
jected contribution, it will be left up to the
Admission and Student Financial Aid
Committee and its subcommittee, the Ad-
mission Board, to decide how the two
criteria will be weighed against one
another.

Robert Grey, senior Admission Board
member, proposed an amendment which
would have dictated that standardized test
results be assigned a lesser value than pron
jectled contribution. The Vote on this
amendment ended in a tie. It failed when
President George Drake broke the tie.

This result indicated to Grey how the
faculty felt the two criteria should be
valued. “The iaculty was essentially say~
ing that test scores and projected contribu-
tion should be weighed about equally,” he
said.

Representing the students at the
meeting was student government vice
president Ali ElSaflar. He said that the
general feeling of the students was that
