Dividing his lecture into two parts,
Dr. S. Dasgupta, professor or phi-
losopliy in presidency college, Unil'cl'~
sity of Calcutta, India, spoke on "Myse
tieism and Some of the Social Aspects
of India." before a large audience in
Herrick chapel last Saturday evening.
Gui-bed in native costume, with a sil—
ver cloth turhaii, the professor ex-
plained the status of the Mohamme-
daus and Hindus in India, ,

“Mysticism really occupies a very
great share of the human mind," der
clai-ed Prof. Dasgupta in the fore part
of his lecture “Mysticism is a theory,
a belief, that superior truth cannot be
attained by logic , . , . there is always
a jump from the known to the un-
knowu." This is true in literature,
art. scicntilic truths and hypotheses,
he said.

Defines Mysticism

He brought out that none of these
are of any particular utility, and yet,
he said, "I love to read poetry be.
cause —_ I love to read poetry."

His topic dealt not So much with the
mysticism of India as 'th the univer—
sal meaning of the word. Again de—
fining the word, he said, “Mysticism
is not a mere finding out of obscure
things but an opening up of the ave—
nue to a spiritual nature. Unless you
can make your mind selfless the pure
spirituality of yourself will never be
It is the revelation
of the spirit of Christ in mail."

"Everyone has his place in life and
there can he no democracy in this in-
ner life!" declared Prot. Dasgupta.
That is where the East and the West
differ, in his estimation. In America
every one is first a citizen and every
one is legally‘enual, but this inner
spirituality which raises one map
above another makes true democracy
impossible.

Explains lIindu Life

In attempting to bridge the gap be-
tween mysticism and the social as-
pects of India, Prof. Dasgupta said
that mysticism had affected the latter.
Then he gave the four divisions of a
Hindu life.

The first period is a student-ship
when a man stays in the family of his
teacher. When he has completed his
education, he becomes a householder,
for every person must marry and have
children. Eyeryone lives for his fam-
ily and all the earnings go to a com-
mon fund. When the man has
reached the age of fifty years, he must
retire’and meditate on spiritualities.
Then in the fourth period of his life,
he must be far in the field of spirit
unlity. His wife accompanies him as
co-religionist during the period of his
retirement. “The ultimate of all is
not gained by reading, but by medita-
tion," Dasgupta declared.

After the lecture, Prof. P. D. Stoops,
head of the philosophy department of

Griiinell college and chairman for the‘v

evening, led the questioning of Dr.
Dasgupta by the audience.
to some of the questions the lecturer
admitted that India is now in a
“hodgepodge" and conditions arc not
normal socially.

The effect of Prof. S. N. Dasgupta's
lecture was somewhat marred by the
peculiarity of his English pronunci—
ation.

"The Enchanted Cottage," by Sir

spite of the illness of the leading char—
the role of Oliver Baslifortli. Al-
acter, David McCcrnack, who plays
the role of Oliver Bashlorth. Al-
though McCornack has been forced to
abandon rehearsals temporarily, work
on the play has continued.

The dream within the 'play is being
completely drilled by Miss Clara Au-
dersea, and the pantomime will be
made more interesting by the use of
novel lighting effects and an orchestra
under Mr. Orville Beelcr, The orces-
tra will consist of Loren Adair, Julizt
Jensen, Vallie hath, Carl Bath. Gerald
Greaser, Orville Greaser, Dorothy
Grcascr, and Graydon Keaton.

Except for minor details, the set has
been in readiness since last week. It
is entirely the creation 01 the play
production class and is expected to
compare favorably with scenery used
in past years.

"The Enchanted Cottage," which has
been performed with success by both
professional and amateur groups, will
be produced by the club in a slightly
different way than the usual movie or
legitimate stage production. The play
is a comedy which contains much of
the subtle and delicate, and lends it-
self easily [u the various fields or
college activities such as music, act:
ing. dancing, and staging.

“Vl’estci'n ciwlizutiou is It. mail chA

N. thsguptll, professor of philosophy
of the University of Calcutta, Iudlil, to

lecture in IIcl‘riClK chapel Saturday
night. “Willi its huge, muscular
trunk it i, crushing and destroying
our lnstllullnns."

“But do you think that the elephant
should he done away with?" he was
asked.

"The elephant would be all right if,
it was trained."

In reply to a query concerning- his
opinion of Mahatma Gandhi's Swarai
and the return to the spinning whecl
iii India, Dosgupta reiterated his belly
timcnt about the elephant. "I refuse
to say anything about politics,“ he
said. “I do not l)0llCVD in Gandhi's

TEAM HAS REAL SPIRIT

Homecoming inc

Sltlurtlily “11]

lluscathed [min a well won victory
over Marquette last Saturday, the Pio-
neers are entering this week's drill
in preparation for the Homecoming
clash against Arms with real spil‘iL
The highly gratifying game which the
Scarlet clad boys played in Milwaukee
revealed the power that the team is
capable of showing.

Peterson and Stotts are still carry—
ing the old injuries received in the
Simpson encounter, (\Stotts is
babbling with a bad knee, and Peter-
son's ankle is causing him quite a bit
of discomfort. Stotts will'be unable
to play, but Peterson will probably be
in good condition by Saturday.

The Pioneer forward pass defense
revealed itself satisfactorily to Grin—
nell supporters in last week's game,
and this factor should hold a good
deal of bearing on the battle with the
Cyclones. Ames has always presented
a good passing offense and this year
should be no exception to the rule, as
the agricultural eleveu'is coached by
one of the greatest forward passers
in the history of the game, Noel Work-
man. Passes from the hand of reery,
Oklahoma Aggie quarter, spelled dea
feat to the Iowa State leam‘ last Sat—
urday. and it remains certain that the
Cyclonenicntcrs will he prepared for
another such attack this week.

'l'wcut .ninfh Game

The Homecoming game will mark
the twenty-ninth game in which Grin—
iiell and Ames have participated since
139 Allies has won seventeen games
and nine have been victories for the-
Pioneers. . In 1924 Ames was defeated
in the last few minutes of play before
a great Homecoming crowd to the
tune of 1443, the win marking‘the
first Grinuell victory for twenty-five
Years. '

The driving attack with which the
Scarlet and Black ran the Golden Ava—
lanche into the ground will be well
oiled for Saturday. Lamb, who dem»
onstrated that he is one of the best
passers in this section, played a hard
running game and in addition was a
bulwark on defense. Meeter is in
shape again to continue some of his
flashy runs, and with the able assis—
tance of A. McClain and H. McLain,
should he a hard man to stop.

litany Sophomores

Ames is presenting a practically
new team this year with an overbai—
ancing number of sophomores in the
lineup. Hall is the only regular from
last year who is holding down a back-
field bertli, and lie ls being used to a
great extent as a pass—tosser. Weiss,
sophomore quarter, showed enough
stuff in the Oklahoma Aggie game to
mark him as a dangerous open field
runner, although his geiicralsliip was
not"all that was to be desired. In re-
turning Pcery's long punts the dimin-
utive Cyclone safety man showed his
real worth.

Captain "Bud" coe played a good
game at end, and in addition did the
puntiug for the Ames eicveu. His
kicks were consistenly longer and bet—
“ter placed than were Peel‘y.‘s boots, al~
though Peer-y was considered one of
the best punters iii the Valley last
season. If kicking is reverted to ex-
tensively Saturday, there should be a
pretty duel between the pioneer pun—
tcrs, Meeter and McLain and the llus<
ky Cyclone wiugman.

Griunell and Allies will enter the
game with about equal weight statis.
tics. although the Griuncll line may
have a slight advantage over Ames'
forward wall.

Mrs. W. Foreman will i i-rive Friday
from Minneapolis to spend Homecom—
ing with her daughter. Miss Virginia
