reason of it being the ﬁrst preliinr
inary, and the short time in which
they httd to prepare them tit-git
merit. 0n the whole the contest
was most interesting and instinc-
tivc, malty new ideas relating to
the immigration question being
brought out. The best speech ot
the evening was delivered by Mr.
Quaife, who spoke third. His dc»
livery was good and he was at
home on the ﬂoor, employing
many gestures; but his strongest
point was in his argument, which
was well thought out and systenir
atically arranged under three
main heads, these being subdivide
ed and backed by sound argument;

To insure a more equal and un»
prejudiced decision, nine judges
were selected. as follows: From
the business men, Messrs. Cow»
den, Fellows and 'l‘hotnburg,
from the faculty, Professors Aluiy.
Davis and Bean, and from the sun
ciety, R. Parker, Blodgett and
Owen. Tliejlldges were instructed
to pay more attention to argument
than to delivery.

Each speaker was allowed six
minutes, being at liberty to choose
either side of the Cornell ques
tion which he saw ﬁt. Mr. Mc-
Carty was the ﬁrst speaker, He
upheld the afﬁrmative and by the
use of a chart tried to show that
crime and illiteracy were parallel.
Mr. McKeag toliowed with on are
gument tor the negative, employ
ing the need or laborers as an are
gumentforimmigration. Mr. Men
Keag, like Mr. McCarty, spoke
from notes. The society was then
favored with a piano solo by Miss
Chase, atrer which Mr. Quaite
spoke tor the amrmative. He
spoke without notes. The fourth
speaker was Mr. Hamlin. He
spoke in tavor ot the negative. and
without notes except toward the
end of his speech. VA dust on the
banjo and guitar was then lul'ilisllr
ed by Messrs. Thompson and Eld-
ridge, who responded to an amus»
ing encore.

Mr. Bair, who spoke ﬁfth, toolt‘

 

up the argument tor the afﬁrma-

Mr. Bali is one of the new
members and one who is expected
to take an active part in the liter-
ary work of the society. Follow-
ing Mr, Burr the society listened
to a vocal solo by Macarinoy, .icr
conipunietl by Nll5~ Atkinsuii, lie
responded to a hearty encore.
The sixth spurllicr. j A. Meade
upheld the ilegatlvc.‘ liespokc
without notes, his speech being
along the lines which the society
has learned to expect from him.
The next speaker, McKee,supr
ported the afﬁrmaiive, speaking
the greater part limit his maiiu»
script. He spoke somewhat llesir
tatingly at ﬁrst but soon warmed
to his subject and was heard to
better advantage. Jones took the
ﬂoor in dotense ot the negative.

speaking in his strong, earnest,

manner, and condensing his argu-
ment into three main puillls. ”the
last speaker, Dickinson, argued
tor the afﬁrmative. He spoke in
a quiet but earliest manner, hold-
ing the attention of his audience
throughout his speech.

While waiting ioi the secretary
to a|li|nge the markings of the
judges, the president appointed
Calderwood to speak exienipota-
neonsly on "The Gymnasium and
Athletics” Arnold on “Semester
Inrpi-essioirs;" Way on “The Work
of the Orchestra," Lind J. E. l’rirltcr
on “College Literature," At the
request of the president Mr. Cowr
den and Mr. Tlloriibtlrg made a
tew i‘emaiks. Mr. Cowden gave
an interestingtalk,spcalttugotthe
time when lie was in college and
commending the society in its
truth. Mr. Thornbutg said he
took much interest in debating
and hoped to see the “Grinnell
spirit” put into debating as it was
in athletics. The words of both
speakers \vele much enjoyed by
the society.

The decision of the judges was
as follows: ist plaC€7QHﬂlfC; 2nd
