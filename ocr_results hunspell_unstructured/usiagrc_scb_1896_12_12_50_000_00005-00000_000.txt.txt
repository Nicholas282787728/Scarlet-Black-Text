The ’96 Team.
(Cantimml/r m Fm: Plight
played the strongest game of his
career. Hc has been on the tcilm
thice yi: His work on hnth
the offense and defense was lil‘ll'
lizlnt, and was marked at all times

by excellent judgment.

Coggeshall at left end was nnt
up to his form of last year. Neit1l~
er his offense nor defense was so
strong and he did not show that
resourcefulness emergencies
which distinguished him here~
tofore. His game however was
good and steady but did not show
the. brilliancy it possessed the pub
vious season.

Douglass, in the games in which

in

u he ivas given a chance played a

very strong end especially on the
dctcnsc. He has a tacnlty ofedg-
ing thrtl interference and downing
the rnnner. which is very annoy-
ing to his opponents. He is a litr
tle slow however. in getting down
the ﬁelds on kick.

At tackle, Blodgett has been
the star of the team. Gains thrn
his side oi the line were almost inl-
possiblc, and he frequently stop-
ped plays made against the other
wing. Hc ivas always much in
evidence in the interference.

Pierce at left tackle. sacriﬁced
his own bright prospects for a brils
liarit reputation for the beneﬁt of
the team. His logical position
was behind the line, but his weight
made it necessary that he should
go forward. He played a hard,
consistent game.

Tait played a splendid tackle in
Des Moincs, Thanksgiving day.
He handled his man very satisfac-
torily and bids fair to be one of
the mainstays next year.

Frisbie is a valuable young playe
er of much promise and has bright
football prospects.

Captain Templeman. owing to
his sickness, has not played a
game thru this season, but his
mere presence in the Minneapolis
game, no doubt had much to do
with the good showing that the
man made. As long as he was in
the game, he kept his opponent
Harding out oi the play; this
achievement in itself is sufficient
comment.

Turner at right guard was a new
man and did not learn his strength
until the last two games. He is

 

strong mitl spuetly, tlcfcntls well,
and is quick and sine in the inlet-
fer-choc.

Hart's work in breaking llll ti his
opponents was VCly strung against
Minnesota. Iona and Des Minnow.
Hts well; in tin: lntmlutuncu was
poor, but nill thlllbllc s hu iin.
pi-ovctl. Hoisapioniisingplnyu.

Cdpl‘oll at ctntci- was vol)
strong. 11: was not outplayed
during the whole s .isoii. in do
false and offense he was above
par. He was particularly notice-
able in getting down the ﬁeld on
pants. He is vcry spcotly. Wt:
rarely punted but that both ends
and the center were on the lullr
back by the time he caught the
ball.

Macartney at quarterback was
sure and steady. His passing was
quick and accurate and he dircct»
ed the play of the team with great
Sli<|ll. Against Iowa and Des
Moinc's
skillful as that of any Grinnell
captain for yeais.

Gray at lctt halt had but very
little opportunity to show what he
could do. At no unit: during the
season has he had lnterletence
worthy of the name, but while he
was given no chancc to milkc long
runs he did herclllcan work in the
interference which enabled his
companion backs to make long
runs.

Mohr at right half had good in
terterence and followed lt well.
which resulted in many long gains
during the, ason. At line bucks
lng he lia snocscded in copying
Sargent's ioini very closely. and
his plunges thru the line Thanks-
giving day was one at the teatui-cs
oi the game. His work on de
tense improved as the season ad-
Vanced hilt may yet he strength-
ened. ‘

Whitehill played in but three
games but fully demonstrated his
ability to be classed among Grins
nell's strong inllrbacks. He
bucked the line in ﬁne foim and
his work in intai-ici-encc steadily
improvcd.

Lindsay is one of the nerviest
men on the team. He.is the surest
tacklcr of them all. He hasa
cool head and remarkably good
judgment.

Norris isan cxccllcnt (lotlgcl'.
and when given the ball scldonl
rails to gain. He is a strong linc
bticlter.

Burd has the making oi a good
football player. Altho rathera
disappointment the present seas~
on. he should not he tliscoiiiaged,
His grcatcst fault is a tendency to
run too high. He llilsguotl ncrve
anti next year should do crcdita-
