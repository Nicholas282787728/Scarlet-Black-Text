Presidentiél

comedy
rouﬁne

by llohcrtnendcr

Alter studying last Saturday
evening. I turned on the old
timewaster (television) to wate’
NBC‘s "Saturday Night Live,”
with guest host Ron Nessen, the
White House Press Secretary. The
show began with our belovc ~
President declaring, “This is
Saturday Night Live,” with a total
time expenditure of 75 seconds.
Later, regular comedian Chevy
Chase announced, “I'm Chevy
Chase and you‘re not," [me
mediately iollowing lhal remark,
President Ford made his second
appearance of the evening. He
declared, “l'm Gerald Ford and
you’re not,“ a total time eigc
penditure of 5.5 seconds,

Ailer checking myseli in the
mirror and thanking GOD that
indeed I was not Gerald Ford l
enjoyed the rest oi the show Whl‘,
iealureo a ten minute skit deplc -
ing the President as some see
him; a bungling idiot, totally inept
at even answering the telephone
The majority of the evening mp
spent zeroing in on the Ford Ad»
ministration, with a total time
exposure ior the President oi 13
seconds

Presidential appearances on
television comedy shows have a
precedent You may all recall that
former President Nixon made a
prophetic appearance on “Rowan
and Martin's Laugh In" when he
said “Sock it to me.” The House’
Judiciary Committee did just thaL.‘

Well, the next day, Presidentiﬁ
contender Ronald Reagan
petitioned NBC for equal time,
while President Ford enjuyeg
the good press due to his T.V,A
appearance. Mr. Reagan thought}
unfair that the President’s lace
was beamed across the nation al no
cost to his campaign.

It would seem that the American
political process is In trans-
formation. The President wanted
to prove that he could take a joke.
while gelling iree primertime
advertising, Mr. Reagan does not
wish to be H. done; he wants to
make an ass out of himselr, loo.
Maybe he should dig up some of ,'
old movies. Voters watching lllnl
get tough with the Indians might
assume he would be tough with the
Russians, '

I'm surprised the Democrats!
have not joined the free ad
vertising campaign Jimmy Carter
would be fantastic in an Ultra-
Bright commercial, not. for his 59.
appeal, but for his ever-present
smile. Henry Jackson, who Hails
his arms around like a dervish,
might consider conducting the New
York Philharmonic Orchestra, Not
to be outdone, Morris Udall would
be super in a commercial for
eyeglasses,

The media plays a major role
campaigns, and ii Walter Cronk§
can develop a “soft shoe,” this
election might be really enr
tertainlng.
