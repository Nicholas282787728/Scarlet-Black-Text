House of Flying
Da- -ers PG-13

Home li/Flying Daggerr is the most recent example
ofii martial arts ulrl masterpiece in a geltrcirlclion
moviesithat is becoming increasingly brutal and
bloody. While it is nor a pioncering or original film,
(director Zhang Yimon also directed ['lcm), it is an
elcgnnr and visually srunnrng .rddrtiun to its already
populi brethren.

As is Yinrou‘s snylc, the emphasis in Home a/‘F/u
mg Daggtll r5 on the beauty ol‘ihc scene Many shors
are even set up in front of perfectly svmrnctr ical backs
grounds, cre rung .rrr il -' n or a work ot art. Bur a
frlrn canuor succeed on it beauty .rlonc, and the ﬁlm
has an intriguing plot for viewers to rollow in between
action scenes.

Haunt a/‘F/ylvg Daggrrr rt . on Jin (Takcshi
Karrcshiro), a police officer who i sent to help quell
the underground rcsrstancc movement led by a group
orr- , sins known as the House of Flying Daggers.
Hrs primary subiect of investigation is Mei (Zhang
Zivi), a blind drnccr, with whom he evennrally esr
capes i‘rom the emperor s soldiers. Presumably, Mei
docs nor know that Jin rs her political adversary, and,
presumably, they fall in love. But politics and romance
are not terribly compatible, and multiple levels of dis
covery and betrayal develop, culminating in a visually
and emotionally stunning climax.

The mesmerizing cinematography contains many
clever shots and the resulr is a ﬂuidity in the frght
scenes that takes the audience through every element
ofthe fight sequences. The movie may not be as good
as Hm. but it a worthy addition to Yimou's repers
tone,

What happens when they run out of ideas?

House of Flying Daggers adds another visually stunning martial arts film to a burgeoning genre, and Before Sunset,
a surprisingly good sequel, continues the fateful conversation that began in Before Sunrise.

Before Sunset (R)

Before you watch Be or: Sinner, you need to know
what happened before rn ery'm'r' smi'ure. In that Genx
tairy t;,rlc lessc( (Ethan Huwkc), an adrift American
meets Cchne (Julio Dclpy), a prororypicrl intelligent
French woman—hot body, hotter accention a train

Jessie employs l\IS lt)rrg‘hair-lrnd-gudtecd clrarm
to convince Celine to stop in Vienna, where rhey
share a magical night of flirtatious and philosophical
conv ion. But it all ends—you guessed itibefoi‘e

Since Before Srnnilc was tclcascd in 1995, Jessie
and Cclrnc have, lrkc the rust of ,agcd a decade. As
the beginning ofrlrc sequel explains, Jessie is now an
adrift writer promoting his first “novel," base 1 strrnr

CBS talent show aims to
unite students,
encourage expression

Bethany Rankin ‘08, treasurer ofCorrccrncd Black
Students (CBS), hopes that this Sunday’s talent show
wru help foster unity among campus groups and pi‘tr
vide a forum in which students can express rhcrnselvcs
in different ways.

“We want people to come out and enjoy them
selves and we really want to unite people,"she said.

While the talent show is only being sponsored by
CBS, any student is welcome to parriciparc.

“We want to show people that your color or race
doesnt matter,—[the talent show] is just. you doing
something to show to the school, Mana Ofosu apt
pirh, CBS .rcriviries coordinator, said.

There is a diverse group of acrs including poetry,
singing, dancing, playing instruments and comedy
skits. CBS organizers emphasize thir the goal ofthe
talent show is to brrng people together to express
themselves in a unique way for the campus commu-
rury.

“Grinnell is such a stresstul place, .urd it's good
to have relief, being able to express yourself rn orhcr
ways and allow other people to see diffcrcnt ways of
expressing yourself," Rankin said,

Though Ofosu-npprah said the main goal is re
“have fun and see what your friends can do,” CBS
members hope that participants and the audience get
more out of the talent show.

“No group on this campus should be exclusive.
We’re trying to show that diversity isn't a simplc black
and white thing, tharyou can’t brsc [diversity] on how
many black students and white students there are,"
Ofosu- -appiah said. Even wirhin racial and ethnic
groups, there' rs so much diversity."

The talent show will beheld rn the Harris Ccntcr
Concert Hall at 7 pm, on Sunday.

ECD Review

Ftom the very first lyrics on Mark
Krmpllcr s torrrth and latest solo album,
S/Ilmglt—Ln, a sense rhnr rhis isnr the
rrsrral commercial rock music is evident.
‘5: 15 Alli, snow laying all around, a
collier cyelcs home, sings Knoptlcr to
a bare bones orchestration.

The song, 5:15 am. tells the story
more life and murder ofa sleazy garnr
blcr' in 19605 Britain. If it seems csor
teric, it's on purposemKnopﬂer’s music
is a paean to the art of the story.

Row," and rhe slcuzy slum described
there could be home to half of Knop—
flcr's vivrd characters. “We gotta ratio:
nirlize... it‘s kill or be killed,"gocs the
first-person account of a striprclub
owner in that track, and while not err
eryone in Sbngrtan is as cold-blood-
ed, they come close.

Calexico’s most rcccnt .rlbum, Fens!
afI/l/l'rc, is an enjoyablc blcnd ol’country,
jazz from the 50’s and 60's, surf music
and mariachi mtrsic. Thc delightfully
idiosyncrutrc two-member group from
Tucson pulls err this unique musical
conglonrcration very well.

Tire group is made up of bass-
ist singer Joey Bums, drummer John
Convenino and their composer Ennio
Morricorlc.

The CD opens with “Sunken
Waltz,” a mellow song that combines
drums, acoustic guitar, accordion, strike

funk and Arncrtcana.

And while he docsn‘t have as many
guitar solos on Slmngl'i-Ln as he did
in previous albums, his bare-fingered
picking is srill memorable.

All this serves to make palatable tht:
stories of the drags of society and those
trying to get out. Several standout
tracks include the cnrchy rribnre to Ray
Kroc, “Boom Likc Th1! " “Song For

but wouldn't stroke the fans.”

Finally, “All That Matters" is a low-
key love song with a moving chorusA
and is also rhc shorrcst song on this unr
rttshcd album, at 3:09. Mark Knopﬂer's
music is hard to categorize, but if you
like complex, nonchalant songs, give
stringy/La a listen.
