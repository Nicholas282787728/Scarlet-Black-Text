what Dr. Gates is Doing.

Under tlle caption “A Sociologir
cal Leader in Wyoming" an inter-
esting article appears in the last
issue ot the Congrrgaliwmlzol. The
peculiar interest tor Grinnell peo-
ple lies in the fact that the socio-
logical leader referred to, is none
other than our own tormer presir
dent, who is now pastor of the
First Church, Cheyenne,

Dr. D. N. Beach, the author of
the article speaks in the highest
terms of Dr, Gatcs’ addresses in
Denver and especially so of his
Lincoln Driy address before the
Men's Club in the same city. But
the principal thing alluded to in
this letter is the work that Dr.
Gates has done and is doing for
Cheyenne and Wyoming. In thc
recent effort to secure the repeal

AN ANSWER.

The Hyde Prize Contest.

It was with considerable surprise
and regret that we learned of the
Faculty action in regard to the
Hyde Contest. We fccl certain
there has been a misunderstanding
somewhcrc. We wish to state as
brieﬂy as possible our side of the
case, It is well known that the
Hyde Contest “preliminary” is for
the sole purpose oi choosing the
three speakers of highest merit to
represent each class when more
than three Speakers in any class
desire to contest. Atno time within
in the memory of the present stu-
dent generation ilas anyj‘prelim-
inary” been held except when
more than three contestants from
a class appeared A preliminary
in such a case would be useless.
The custom has been to speak with
the professors of the English de-
partment.andifno morethanthree
from a class had declared an in~
tention of entering the contest
nothing more was said of a “pre-
liminary.” The old custom has
been followed this year. Before
the datesct forthe“preliminaries,”
with one exception. each of us
whose names appear below had
interviewed Prof. Noble in regard
to the contest and expressed to
him all intention ofentel'ing. The
sole reason more oratiolls were
not sublnitted on April 20 is simp-
ly this: Each one of us had made
sure that there were but three in
our respective classes intending
to enter the contest and we mere~
ly did as former contestants have
dolleiwent on with the prepara-
tion of our orations, expecting to
be fully prepared [or the contest
Commencement week.

The stage of preparation of our
orntions is evidently misunder-
stood. On April 20 when the ora-
tions should have been submitted,
provided any preliminaries were
necessary, ﬁvc of us had complet-
ed, or practically completed, our

 

 

productions The other four had
collected our material, perfected
olrr line of lllouglit, and, in one or
two cases at least. had formulated
an oullrne for our orntionoiand
putting the formulated thought in
to words is by no means the most
arduous task in writing an oration.

Clearly, then, olrr preparation
this year has not been neglected.
It is sclfrevident that any member
ofa college class with enough serir
ousness to enter a contest in orae
tory will ordinarily have ambition
enough to devote sufﬁcient time
to his preparation to enable him
to do his best in the effort for the
prize. it is not to be supposed
that a man will stand up in any sort
of contest simply to be knocked
down

Furlhcl'morc,thi5contest,forthe
ﬁrst time in a number of years,
would have had a lull representa-
tion from each class. This fact
bespeaks at least an increasing in-
terest in oratory overthat of recent
years. Tile winners of the Hyde
Contests in past years have been
among the most earnest and
worthy men in school, and the res
ward of the Hyde Prize Contest
has been for merit alone,

In a college where there is no
chair of oratory and where the
Hyde Contest,and the Home Con-
test in the fall are the only oppor-
tunities for practice in that line
with any sort of external stimulus,
it certainly would seem to be far
more detrimental to the cause of
oratory in our college to call the
contest off on the shadow of a
technicality than to face the inev-
itable risk of a possible one or
two appearing on the program
hampered to some extent by insuf-
ﬁcieiit preparation.

We fully understand that the
time now lost makes the contest
forthisyearpracticallyimpossible
and that any criticism of the action
of the Faculty,such being thecase.
must savor of criticism for criti-
cism's sake. But we feel that a
step has been taken which is un.
wisc and wish to present to the
Faculty and those interested
among the students, the facts on
olir side of the case.

We hope if the evident misun-
derstanding has been on our part
iif we have mistaken the purpose
