Spare him the bowling jokes—it’s notjust a game, dude

Why do people lliugh when i tell them I’m
in a bowling league?

I have had many conversations lately in
which the topic of bowling has come up (ad-
mittedly, it’s usually at my prompting) and
people always seem surprised and unabashedly
bemused when I mention my dedication to the
league and my passion for the sport. lfI dare
to mention that I own my own shoes and ball,
their eyes grow wide with ineredulity. It’s the
same look I get when I tell people my favorite
movie is “Teen Wolf."

These discomforting looks usually keep
me from mentioning how excited I am to be
a card-carrying member of the
Poweshiek county chapter
of the United States Bowling
Congress, or USBC. But ifI’m
ever required to produce a sec-
ond form of ID,I know exactly
what I'm going to pull out of
my wallet.

I suppose these reactions
stem from the popular miscon-
ception of bowling as a pastime
for the chronically square mid-
dle-aged suburban dad and a
sport for the uneathlei-ic. People
probably look at me and thinle
“You’re a young, hip dude in
the prime ofhis life.With your
physical prowess and killer physique, 1 simply
assumed you spent your time doing extreme
sports, like ice climbing or cross-country snor-
keling."

Well, I can't fault the logic in the second
half of that paragraph (I’ve got a mirror, so

People probably look or
me and think, ”You’re a hip,
young dude in the prime of
his life, With your phyrrto/
prowess arid krI/er physique
lsimply assumed you iperrl
your time doing extreme
rporis, like ice t/imbirig or
trosx-(ouniry snorkeling."

I know what all the fuss is about), but I will
take issue wrth the ﬁrst. Bowling is notjust for
middle-aged menigo to any bowling alley in
America and l guarantee you’ll see guys way
past middle-aged. More like guys from the
Middle Ages, amirite.>

No, not rite: Bowling is enjoyed by a wide
spectrum of people who wisely recognize its
value as a sport and social activity For the seri-
ous bowler, it is an ongoing competition with
oneself, a chance for perpetual selftimprove-
ment, a mental and physical test of one’s cone
centratron and ﬁnely-honed skills. Plus, you
get to drink beer while you're doing it.

There are two distinct
types of bowling~.soclal and
competitive. Social howling
sees the game as an excuse
for hanging out, and rolling
the ball is simply an addition
to—or possibly an interruption
ofminteracting with friends.
You tent some shoes, grab a
ball off the rack, and you may
or may not even watch to see
how many pins you knock
down after you roll For many,
the whole event is only an ex-
cuse to quote “The Big Leb-
owski.”

competitive bowling keeps
many or the elements or social bowhng, but
there is a lot more conversation about form,
technique and lane conditions The competie
tive bowler lives and dies by strikes and spares
as he or she seeks to dominate the lane with
each roll or the ball, For many ofus, the whole

event IS still mainly an excuse to quote “The
Big Lebowsk'l," but we identify more with The
Jesus than The Dude.

The more seriously one takes howling as a
sport, the more ﬁln it becomes. I’m not a great
bowler, but I am competitive and I like the fact
that each frame presents a distinct goal, the
achievement ofwhich depends entirely on my
own abilities. While it may not be as physically
demanding as a sport like basketball or foot

I feel like I've learned a lot, too. I‘ve
learned how to go from rolling a straight ball
to rolling a hook, taking delight in those times
when the ball glides perfectly into the pocket
and explodes the plus I’m learning how to
keep myself from getting too frustrated by
the times when I leave myselrwith an impos
sible split or fall to pick up a one-pin spare.
And I've learned that joining a men's bowling
league is not a great my to meet women.
Those who

 

ball, it still requires
a lot of hand-eye
coordination, men-
tal toughness in the
form of concentra
tion and strnte
and the develop
ment of acute mus-

clrmcmory. And, did I mention that you get
to drink beer while you're doing it?

Participating in a league raises the stakes
for each ball and each game for the individual
while allowing the team to bond by striving to-
ward a shared goal. When you get a strike or
pick up a difﬁcult spare, you get to celebrate
that achievement—lfyou miss, there is always
the next frame. .

I’ve gotten a lot out of becoming a serit
ous bowler. The warmth of the alley provides
a welcome refuge during the cold Iowa winter.
I've gotten to spend quality time with the fac-
ulty and faculty spouses who are on my team.
I’ve gotten to know people from the Grinnell
community who are not part or the College.
I’ve been able to say to someone, "Sorry, Smoke
ic, you’were over the line. Mark it zero. Next
frame"~nnd1mennz r't.

scoff at the
sport tend to be
those who have
very little expe-
rience with it,
and so they fail
to appreciate
its complexity and the skill required to truly
excel. They may laugh, but to the dedicated
bowler, the sport is no joke. It is a heroic en-
deavor, a sacred ritual, and, when you're all
alone staring down the lane, forced to rely
solely on your own mental and physical skills,
it is a chance to challenge your only truly wort
thy opponenriyourself.

so the next time you talk to someone like
me who mentions that he or she is a serious
bowler, don't laugh in that person's face. Don’t
laugh at the Pact that l have my own shoes
(they’re awesome), that 1 own my own hall
(it's emerald green and it says “Hammer" on
it, so you know it's tough),or thatl carry that
ball in a Philadelphia Eagles howling bag that
my mom bought me. It would be much better
to be polite and then laugh as you’re walking
away because you don't want to mess With me.
