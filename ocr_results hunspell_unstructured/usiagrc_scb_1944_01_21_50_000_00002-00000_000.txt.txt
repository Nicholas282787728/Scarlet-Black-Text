H's Your h/iove - -

The other day we overheard someone coin—
lnelltlng that they wondered what would
be the ‘sclliug approach“ for the Fourth
War Loan Drive. The statement disap-
pointed us considerably, for the tone of
the speaker suggested a sort of patient
resignation on being “put upon;” a cen-
taint, that he was, in the words of one
Iowa paper, about to be 'inilked’ again.
To us it does not seem so. This ‘drive‘
varies from others that utilize cheesecake
publicity and slogans and coersion, in that
every bit of ‘push‘ required to sell war
bonds and stamps is really proof of a
laxness on the part of the American pub-
110,. We don’t like to sell War bonds by
‘drive’ methods, but even more do we re—
sent the martyr attitude of some Amerie
cans who can never see the Well-known war
effort except as something outside them-
selves, who always stand passively by and
wait for someone to make a sales ‘ap<
proacli.’
This is no problem for' a half of the
nation, or worse still a tenth. This is no
merchandizing problem in which there is
a salesman and a potential buyer, and all
manner of sales psychology in between.
This is not a question of leisurely choice
between several proffered articles. This,
dear countrymen, is war. It is a. plain and
often ugly business. And it is her . It is
now. To end it as quickly as possible, and
~more important—to end it successfully
regardless of the time required, is the
only legitimate ambition of any of us Fo
that iob money is required, lots of money
It cannot be just the excess funds of the
very wealthyiit must be the little contri—
butlous of all tlle little people, merging

iillto a powerful total. If those little cone
tl'ibutioils were regularly and Jrecly made,
'dl'ives' would not be necessn ‘. But be,
cause so many of us fail ill our day by dov
responsibility, a concentrated effort must
be made at certain times by certain people
ill an attempt to enlist the aid of the
greater mas Such an effort is the Fourth
\\ ar Loan Dl'lV .

We don’t know if there is a special
slogan for this drive. V\'c don’t care. We
don’t intend to uheedle you with comfort
ing statistics about tllc per cclltage of
profit you will obtain at the end of tell
years. We don’t intend to shock you with
awesome statistics about the inch who may
die because they don’t have the bullets
your dollars nii ht buy. You know as well
as we do that the United States gm
erniiicnt has to buy bullets on credit it
will do so. But yoll know too that it is for
your good and those soldiers’ good that
we pay as much as we call as ue go. You
know what you can pe ', You know where

Wise Old Senior Says — -

Have ou been (liddling all semester? anc
you had bi' bull sessions the better part
of the year thus far? Then now is the
time to knuckle down! I!
‘is onl‘ a few days away now—Awe to be
exact, so if you like the life around here
well enough to stay the advice of this
writer is to begin preparing for that
boogey-man—final week, This editorial is
of course directed at the freshman classi
after all, if the upperclassmen don’t know
what’s in store for them by this time, it’s
too late to learn. By this time the meme
bers of the freshman class should realize
that college isn’t the breeze that high
school lvaseyou’re not coasting on your
reputation now—you’re making it! If mid-
sems seemed a triﬂe difficult, if papers
seemed a’little harder than anything you
had done before, then my young brethren
and sistern, hold onto your hats because
you “ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”

Seriously though, you’ll be Wise to take
the advice of a sage old senior and start
availing yourself of all your spare time—

the knowledge that you can. Then when
you go into the examination room (not to
be mistaken for a court room) all you’ll
have to do will be to turn on the faucet
and that knowledge will come pouring out
li e wate Won’t momma and poppa be
proud of those H's? And you can tell them
that it was all due to a funny little edie

torial you read a few days before exam
week.
