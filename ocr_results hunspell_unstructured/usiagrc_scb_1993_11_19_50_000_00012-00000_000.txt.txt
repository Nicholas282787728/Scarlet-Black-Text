Evelyn Freeman, Grinnell College
women's cross country coach, about
her team‘s fifthrplaee finish at the
NCAA Division III central region

shy of qualifying for the national
meet.

The top four teams of the region

edged Gustavus Adolphus, 161-168,
for fifth place.

“Now we have to cheer for the
teams in our region to perform well
so we can muinmin our four team
slots at the nationals next year," said
Freeman.

She continued, ”Our runners
were very disappointed. They really
wanted a chance to run at home in the
national meet. There are many bright

spots, though. This is the beSt we
have ever finished at the regionals
and we did it with three frosh, three
sophomores and one senior runner.
The future definitely looks good."

Another disappointment was
