On certain mountains in the Near East is a
limited collar of earth—called in Turkish,
“Yucca.” Tobaccos grown there cost as
high as $1.00 2 pound. Carefully they are
examined, leaf by leaf. Often it takes a
man a whole day to select two pounds of
certain of these ﬁne tobaécosi Lucky Strike
is the world’s biggest user of fine Turkish
tobaccosl For these tender, delicate Turk~
ish leaves are blended with choice tobaccos
from our OWn Southland—to make your
Lucky Strike a cigarette that is fully packed
—round and firm—free from loose ends.
That’s why Luckies taste better, smoother.
