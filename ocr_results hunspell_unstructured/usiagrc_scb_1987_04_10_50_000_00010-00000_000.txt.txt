It wasn t exactly fun at the old ballpark
as the Pioneers opened their 1957 season
losing a doubleheader to Monmouth
Coach Pfitsch surprised by his team’s
lackluster performance, said frankly, “it
was pretty lousily played on our part.”
And then some

Pfitsch didn’t have any real explanation
for last Saturday's misfortunes. The coach
figured that the only plausible reason for
the defeats was simply that his team had
the “jitters." as it was their first con-
lerence game, The anxiety-ridden
Pioneers, led by pitcher Jim Weiand, were
the victims of a norhitter in a 104) loss in
the first game. The second game proved a
litle better, but not much, as Brad
Sheridan suffered a 7-5 loss.

Whether or not these poor outings are
the result of nerves will never be known.
What is for sure is that Pfitsch was disap-
pointed with his team‘s performance as
compared with spring training in Texas.
He knows his team has the talent to win —
one of the difficulties in pinpointing a
direct Cause for the losses 7 they just have
to show it. “If we play anywhere near our
ability, we will deiiniteiy give anyone a
good game,"

While the varisty didn't live up to
Ptitsch s expectations, the junior varsity
swept a doubleheadera from Cornell on

1 Wins!

Schumahr, Caryn Erickson, Giny Frazier,
Kathy Marr, Jennifer Robison, and Mars
tha Lederer, who chipped in one apiece. 0n
the defensive end of things, newcomers
Kathy Zabel, Rae Wright, and Karen Gleni
nemeier each contributed to the Pioneers’
effort.

“After losing 13 straight games through
last season, this win comes as a tremen-
dous confidence booster for the team,"
said Coach Jim Gilbert. The team's next
game will be another Tuesday matchrup.
The Pioneers will face Indian Hills Come
munity College in another doubleheader,
this one at home. Game time is 3:30 pm,
on the East Field >Diam0nd, directly
behind the Health Centei.

Stumbles

Tuesday. Dave Steinman got the win and
Wallace Squibb the save in the first game
with a 9-H victory. Freshman John Bollard
added to the festivities, chalking one up in
a 5-4 battle.

The coach was pleased with this sound
performance by the reserves; they didn‘t
suffer from any “anxiety problems."
Pfitsch was pleasantly surprised with how
his team matched up with Cornell, ex-
ecuting fundamental baseball in all
aspects of the game. The J.V. squad show-
ed determination, continually coming
from behind with conSiStent hitting in a
game marked by a Srrun rally in the bot-
tom of the fifth to cap off the win,

Continuing his psychological analysis of
the varsity team, Coach Piitsch diagnosed
the problem as an inieriority complex
which goes into eliect when the team plays
opponents who have beaten them in the
past For Piitsch it represents the only ex»
planation for the losses “We have two
quality starting pitchers who can keep us
in any ball game, so as long as we over-
come this Complex, we should do all
right.” The Pioneers will get a chance to
shed this “complex" tomorrow in a con-
ference doubleheader against rival Coe.
Show up for some ion in the sun and help
the Pioneers snap their oz start. '
