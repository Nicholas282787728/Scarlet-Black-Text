The reaction oi Grinnell students to
the (trait lottery this Wednesday was
neither surprising nor particularly
intense, Those most concerned were
the male students who turn 19 this
year, most at these are members
at the freshman class. Many {resh-
men and most upperclassmen on
campus were either unaware that
the lottery was taking place or were
not terribly excited about it. Not
surprisingly, concern among {resh—
men men varied inversely with the
size of the “random sequence” numr
hers.

The winning birthdays in this year's
lottery were March 6 and March 7,
which are numbers one and two, res-
pectively. The 5&5 checked with
the local draft board and discovered
that they are currently processing
individuals in this year’svulnerable
group with numbers of titty or less,

On his Wednesday morning show on
KDiC lreshman John Wylie invited
listeners to phone in with their re,
actions to the lottery. He said he
received over one hundred calls;
those with high numbers were not
particularly upset and greatly res
lieved, but those with the lowest
numbers were at best uncertain of
their immediate futures and at worst
upset.

Some recipients ot low numbers
were not terribly concerned Fresh~
man Dave Raul: remarked, “I’m
pretty sure i can get out or it by
ﬂunking my physical, so I’m not
worried about it,”

Other students commented on the
validity oi military conscription and
01 the lottery method now used. Opin-
ions of the lottery method varied.
One student felt it was ”a new dimen—
sion in absurdity”, another that it is
“better than the arbitrary way that
it was done beiore when everyone
was worried about the dratt. It gives
those who are eligible the decision
to light it or noti"

Freshman Craig Murphy teels that
"the constitutionality of the drait is
questionable” and suggested that
since the Vietnam war is winding
down it may be possible to test the
constitutionality “without all the
emotional MEL.”

Executive Council

Considers New Department

Reconsideration DIa department of
Religious Studies and presentation oi
an early retirement plan at other
ACM colleges occupied theattention
oi the Executive Council at its Jan»
nary 19 meeting,

Dennis Haas and Howard Burkle of
Religious Studies appeared beiore
the Council to restate their case for
the establishment at a full-iledged
Department oi Religious studies. An
earlier request {or the establish
merit of such a department was de-
Ieated by the Council on December
20.

Burkle and Haas discussed the
rationale behind the December 20
decision, and later answered ques-
tions from Council members. After
their appearance, the council de-
cided to take no action, in eIIect
reaffirming the December 20 de
cision.

Mr. Burkle has now taken the mat-
ter directly to the faculty, which will
begin consideration at the proposal

Editorsh

The Committee on Student Publica-
tions and Radio has Opened applicae
tiOnS ior the editorship of next year’s
Scarlet and Black

There will be three paid editorial
positions on next year’s SltB, com-
mittee chairman James Hottois said.
The positions will be editor, manag-
ing editor, and either copy or layout
editor

The committee is currently solici—
ting applications lrom individuals
who might seek appointment to any
of these positions Applications tor
the post of editor must be Submitted
on or before February ll, 1972, to
Mr, Hottois.

Hottois said the committee will
make a decision about the post of ed—

itor prior to considering the applir
Cations for the other paid positions.

At their last meeting, the comr
mittee appointed Jim Ammerman
business manager and Bob Buchanan
advertising managerlor this semese
ter.

at its next meeting. In a letter to the
iaculty announcing the proposal,
Burkle made several important
points.

He indicated that the proposed dee
partment would consist oi Dennis
Haas, himsell, and the new Relig-
ious Studies inculty member already
approved. The department would
create a major from the current
Religious Studies courses, the
American intellectual History
course, and new courses to be de-
vised alter the appointment or the
third faculty member.

The letter continued that there is
sufficient student interest in relig~
ious studies to justify the creation
or a new department,

Mri Burkle noted that no additional
outlay or iunds would be required by
the establishment of the new depart-
ment. Religious studies already has
a separate budget and a separate
library account; these would simply
be taken over by the newdepartment.

Grade Plan Dehoted

The Joint Board in its Mon-
day night meeting settled a book
keeping dispute and discussed stu~
dent concern With the creditrlail
restriction included in the Parslow
grade proposal.

Alter a Somewhat incomprehensi-
ble debate between the student mone-
tary minds, Auditor Greg Theilmau
and Finance Committee Chairman
George Shybut, it was decided that
previous bookkeeping arrangements
were inadequate, instead oi reallor
cating unused funds in January as
previously decided, accounts will
now be zeroed in February. Theil-
man explained that account balances
in December are not accurate indi-
cations or actual money spent. He is
“still getting bills irom McNally’s.”
By zeroing accounts in February,
Theitman feels that bookkeeping
problems will be alleviated.

Hinder Academic Freedom?

In a discussion oi the Parslow pro-
posal, members of the Joint Board
responded favorably to all but one
aspect of the revised grading sys-
tern. Some Presidents expressed
concern that academic ireedom
would be hindered by limitations
placed on the number of credit-tail
courses allowed.

Under the Parslow grading system,
the D grade will be eliminated, and
no credit will be given (or work be-

low C quality. Members ofthe Board
round these provisions favorable.
Failures will not be recorded on the
student’s transcript. The Education»
al Policy Committee also voted to
restrict the credit-tail option to no
more than one course a semester,

Arguments against the credit-(ail
restriction were numerous. The ma-
jority of bored members voiced the
opinion that as many options as pos-
sible should be available to the stu-
dent, Mike siegel, in detense oI the
crediH‘ail restriction, pointed out
that there is no necessity for a cre-
ditvfail option under the A-B-C/
erase system. “In addition," Siegel-
says, “graduate schools do not react
lavorahly to grades 01 credi

Standard Question

The general consensus of the Board
members was summed up by Mario
Bognanno when he said “Those peo—
ple who don’t want to go to graduate
school should not be penalized Ioi'
accepting a diiIerent stander

Although there was strong student
interest in maintaining at least one
course credit—tail, the Board meme
bers were undecided exactly how,
much freedom in credit-tail options
should be available.

Shelley Floyd plans to express stu-
dent concern about the credit-tail
restrictions at the Executive Board
meeting on Thursday.
