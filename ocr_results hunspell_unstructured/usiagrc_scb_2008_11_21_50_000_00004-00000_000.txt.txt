Last Sunday in the Forum South Lounge,
Dayna Hamann ’09 was putting the finishing
touches on a sign that read “Discrimination."
on the wall opposite, another sign reading
“Privilege" had been mounted in preparation
{or group activities to follow, while students
milled around a table covered in pizza.

This ﬂurry of activities was all part of a
retreat designed to discuss the establishment
at Grinnell college ofa Peer Education Pro
gram (PEP), a grassroots program designed to
build community solidarity and raise aware-
ness about issues of discrimination. PEPs are
highly interactive and generally involve trained
students teaching peers about discrimination
and privilege at Grinnell and introducing rvays
to create a safer and more inclusive Grinnell.

The purpose ora PEP at Grinnell, accord-
ing to Molly McArdle ’09, a retreat organiz-

er, would be “to make a more understanding

campus where differences are respected and
students can feel safe. We Grinnellians want
more than just posters," McArdle said. “We
want to enact permanent changer"

Students started the ﬁrst hour of the res
treat by discussing privilege and discrimination
at Grinnell, after which
students broke off into
smaller groups to explore
already-established models
for PEPs at five other col-
leges and universities and
how those models might
be replicated at Grinnell.

To keep the attendants
fresh throughout, the re-
treat was punctuated by
lorminutc breaks during which music played .
and students chatted amongst themselves and
with administrators.

During one such break, Marcia Putdy,

Molly MtArdle’09

interim director of Intercultural Affairs, said
that the retreat had made her hopeful about
the prospects ota PEP at Grinnell. "Here you
have students and administrators working to
gether," she said.

Vice President for Student Affairs Houv
ton Dougharty delivered the
ﬁnal remarks, emphasizing
that ours is a “special time" at
Grinneil and that “we share a
munial responsibility to seize
transformative opportunities,"
he said.

The idea for the PEP be-
gan when a group or friends
devised what one member
called a “dream program,"
and began taking steps to make connections
with administrators and set the terms of the
program that they envisioned. The retreat pro-
vided an opportunity for wider student opin-

ion to be gauged Reﬂecting their emphasis on
community engagement, organizers said they
hope to engage the rest of the student body
by tabling outside the dining hall among other
things.

After nearly four hours many participants
were still engaged—often with furrowed brows
and concerned jaw linehweighing options
for a PEP at Gtinnell.

In an e-niail, Latona Giwa ’10, one of the
event’s organizers, wrote that the retreat‘had
been a huge success. “This four-hour session
was just a beginning. These discussions will
continue for the rest of this semester. Students
will find ways to engage the rest of the campus
committee in this dialogue while having week—
ly meetings with administrators to establish
the detailed components for this program."

Giwa said she hoped that a proposal for a
PEP program could be created by the end of
the semester.

decision to withhold funding.
Prior to the Thursday meeting. according to
one organizer, Claire Branigan ’1!, there had
been no contact between administrators and
students:

"We only had speculations really," Branir
gan said. “[Eut], the ﬁlnding has been passed
for the past ﬁve years and we didn't know why
all ofa sudden it had been brought up now."

In a previous interview with the $553.09
good had said he was hesitant to provide funtlr
ing because of the College's falling cndowmenr
and because ofthe legal implications ofa norr
proﬁt funding what seemed to be a political
activity “one, we're being careful about every
expenditure,“ Osgood said. "Two, because the
college is a charity, we don't fund advocacy
trips."

The following day, trip organizers met
with Osgood and Dougharty and discussed
the trips proposal, though a resolution was not
reached until it Sunday afternoon retreat on
social justice. There, administrators presented
organizers with an agreement in which the
College would fund the trip while students

signed a waiver to refrain from illeyl activity
and seek the permission to miss classes. ans
other administrative concern.

While the administrators ultimately agreed
to fund the trip, Osgood said he still has some
qualms about the schools support. “The Coi-

lcge's endowment is
down 30 percent and
we’re spending £6000
[after students contrib-
uted] to send people to
miss class?” Osgood said.
“You know, I’m not a big
fan of people missing
class,"

Though currently res
solved, the episode raised
questions about the Cole
lege's legal and ﬁnancial
commitment to student advocacy trips in gen
eral. “It was all very confusing and I think it
still is," Branigan said “I would like to see
very clear guidelines for students who want to
propose things in the future so they won't have
to go through something like this again."

Micah Bot-Miller ‘11, a trip organizer,

Russell K. Osgood

said he felt administrators had handled the
events poorly. "I think they haven’t been pro—
fessional and up front [in regards to eommu~
nication] they had this meeting and didn’t
let us know, but let others know," he said. “To
hear something like [we might lose funding]

through secondhand ac
counts without a rationale
was frustrating"

Osgood defended his
original apprehension roe
wards the trip. “To say that
this was over the 'ne would
be to overstate ' " Osgood
said. “To say that it's right

the line is that you carr—

probably close to rte rlli7lillli5but we do a lot of
things that are on the line,"

The line Osgood was referring to was the
Internal Revenue Services prohibition against
political lobbying activities by 501(c)(3) non
proﬁt organizations, which is meant to ensure

n the line lS

President

that primarily political advocacy groups do not
benefit from the tax-exempt status aﬂ’orded by
a 501(c)(3) designation.

According to Internal Revenue Service lit-
erature,“]n general, no organization may qual-
ify for section 501(c)(3) status if a substantial
part ofits activities is attempting to inﬂuence
legislatiorr.,.."This substantial part test marks
the line.

The IRS generally dmws a distinction bee
tween attempting to inﬂuence legislative decir
sions as opposed to executive or administrative
ones r does include some exceptions to the
restrictions, noting that “organizations may
conduct educational meetings. prepare and
distribute educational materials, or otherwise
consider public policy issues in an educational
manner without jeopardizing their tax-exempt
status."

Trip participants expressed concern about
the precedents that corrld have been set. “There
should be an enormous campus discussion that
arises because of this," said Joseph Hiller ’12,
a trip participant. “I am going to be here the
next three years. threcsand~a—hal.fyears, so it's
really kind oflmportant."
