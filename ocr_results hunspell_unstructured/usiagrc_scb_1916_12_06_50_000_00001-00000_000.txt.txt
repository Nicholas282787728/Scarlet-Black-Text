With the class basket ball series
only a week away, the various teams
have settled down in earnest to prac-
ticing in preparation for the struggle

ship of the College.

The schedule for the series has just
been formulated. The games will be
played thc evenings of the 12th and
14th and the afternoons oi the 18th'
and 19th of December.

Captains Ntm‘ Chosen.

All the teams have chosen their cap—
tains. Donald Meachani heads the
Seniois. “Mike” Augustine is the lead-
er of the Junior five, Foster Basso
captains the Sophs, and “Dutch" Gar-
iier, the Criuncll iiigh star last year,
has been chosen to lead the Fresh.
