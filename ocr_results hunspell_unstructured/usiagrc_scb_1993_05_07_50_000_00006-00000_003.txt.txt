and an updated facility.

McKibbin believes that a new
and improved FineArtsBuilding
would unify the art department.
At present, the department is
spread out across the campus
and town. Some professors have
ofﬁcesinSteiner,whileothersare
located in the Fine Arts Building.
The art study room is in the base-
ment ofBurling Library and stu-
dent work is either displayed in
the Forum or at the library.

If the Fine Arts project goes
through, the art department
hopes to beneﬁt with more and
better space and larger equip
ment. One of the major draw-
backs of the current facility is
that students are constantly be-
ing turned away.

“With a new facility, we could
servemorestudentsbecauseright
now we turn down a lot. And
right now it’s impossible to bring
in an artist. The campus doesn't
even know whatit’smissing. The

new facility would also have a
museum, which would beneﬁt
the entire community, both the
campus and town.”

Behind technology

”Theatre has changed in the
past thirty years,” said theatre
professor Pip Gordon. "It’s like
the difference between a Model T
Ford and a Ferrari. in the past 30
years, Grinnell hasn't kept up
with technology at all.”

RoberLsTheatreisplaguedwith
problems, according to Gordon.
When it was built in 1961, it
might have been considered
avant‘gardeatthetime, butit no
longer is adequate for students
today, she said.

"There are major design ﬂaws
in this building; There is no lly
system, there are ﬂuorescent
house lights. When Roberts The-
atre was built, it was known for
its concrete ceiling, but concrete
has nothing to do with theatre

and the acoustics are noneexisA

The lack of a ﬂy system limits
students as to the type ofproduc-
tion they can do and what they
can learn, said Gordon. “It's like

having no Bunsen burners in a
science lab.”

Costs inhibit productions
Roberts Theatre also lacks a
costume room and scene shop.

Grinnell views its bookstore as
“part of the education process.”
Last year’s bookstore sales
amounted to $805,000, accord-
ing to Clay,
The store has a proﬁt margin

on textbooks of 20%, forinstance
buying a book for$8 and selling
it to students for 310. Popular
books not used in classes are sold
at a 35-45% proﬁt margin. The
margin for clothing is 40% and
candy, 12%.

Grinnell's town bookstore,
Boldada, sells its books at a 40%
profit margin. University of
lowa’s campus bookstore, aimed
at generating proﬁt, uses a 25%
proﬁt margin for textbooks not
priced by the publisher.

McBeeandAndersonsaidthat
26% of the profit margin on
booksgoesforfreightandtherest
covers costs such as utilities and
employee salaries.

Shoplifting and other ”shrink-
age” amounts to about 83% of
sales, or about $6,680 last year,
accordingtoAndersonandClay.
”llit got out ofhand too much, it
would increase prices for stu-
dents,” said McBee.

Dining services swindle?
Is the college cashing in on
students in the dining halls? Not
really. Does dining services turn
a proﬁt?
“Yesandno,”saiddirectorDave
McConnell, explaining that
about 50% ofboard money goes
for food and 35 to 37% forwages.

The remaining 13 to 15% is kept
as reserves for big, occasional
expenses, including buying new
furniture and ﬁxing the stained
glasswindows, paneling andyel-
low carpeting on the walls in
Quad.

The reserves also coversudden
price changes in the “volatile”
food market, giving dining ser-
vices the leeway to not cat food
options, according to McConnell.
“DuetoCalifomianfloodinglast
March, the price of lettuce
doubled, which meant an extra
$950 to keep lettuce on the salad
bar that month."

added that the Grill’s operating
