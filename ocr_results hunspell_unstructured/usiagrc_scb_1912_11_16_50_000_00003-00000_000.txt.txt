DUGKINGS

An ardent Dialte enthusiast, sporting
a roll of Drake money, hit Grinnell
yesterday. He reports that Simons
and Which, the at Drake's stars, hill
be out or the game tomorrow. Romany
her that grain of salt!

We have it from the same authority-

that “'eatliei'h'a will taite Weleh's
place at end, w ile iletienrr Ml re-
place sinions at half!
“Red" Eligau will act as captain
‘ while "Monrnliil Jim" will view the
game iro mthe sidelines
‘Red" and
Oh, Jar!

All indications are that
“Bill" will have n d ﬁeld.

Watch the Draite Delphio man change
his mind.

Revenge is su eet.

Although the Drake game looms up
big belore elel'i' Grinneil student, quite

, a. number are manifesting an interest

in other big games toilet. The Ames-
Iowa is probably the most. important
in Iowa and the “Et 'l'u Allies' slogan
will he heard at. Allies today in opposir
tion to the "Beat And Eat ion-a" oi
the Aggies. Kansas will strive as they
say to “Smash The Stielim Roller”
(Stiehm is the Nebraska Conch). cor-
neLl vs Coe will be of interest in the
state while Wisconsin and Minnesota
will battle for the Western Champion
