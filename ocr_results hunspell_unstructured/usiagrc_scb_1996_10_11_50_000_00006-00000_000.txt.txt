Griot gives lectures and performances as artist—in-residence

By KATE KLEINWORTH
Staff Writer

Back by popular demand, Alhaji
Papa Susso, oral historian and mu—
sician from The Gambia, will be
performing in concert tomorrow in
the South Lounge of the Forum at
2 pm, not 8 pm. as was previ-
ously announced. The performance
will be free of charge. This will be
the end of his four days as artist-
in-residence at Grinnell, during
which he gave two lecture
perfomances,

Susso performed here once last
year, and the amount of student inr
teresl shown in his work led the
college to arrange to bring him
back for a longer period of time so
students could have more contact
with him.

Papa Susso is a griot, orjali' in
the Mandinka tongue, a member of
a long line of traditional bral his—
torians and musicians. His mother
and father were griots, and he is
teaching his nine children to folr
low in his footsteps.

Griots were originally attached
to the courts of kings, memorizing
what went on in court and telling
the tribal history of their people.
For centuries, the duty ofthe griot
has been to act as oral historian,
genealogist, poet, counselor, and
entertainer.

“Our duty is to sing the history
of our people," Susso explained,
“Also, when someone has a prob-
lem with a friend and doesn‘t want
to talk to them, it is our duty to
intervene without an invitation. We
intervene even in some marriages,
because in my part of Africa, you
don’t choose your wife, your par-
ents do that for you."

Islam is "very imprtint in the

daily lives ofAfrican people," ace
cording to Susso, and as ajalt, he
plays a significant role in many re-
ligious events. The grioi's duty is
also to perform at important occar
sions such as weddings and funere
als of kings and important citizens.
When author Alex Haley died,
Susso was asked to sing and play
the kora, the traditional instrument
used by griots, at his funeral.

Each ofthe instruments used by
griots - the kora, kontingo, balafon
and dundungo - was invented by a
different griot family and passed
down through the centuries.

The kora was invented by the
Susso family in the 10th century.
The art ofmaking and playing this
instrument has been passed down
in siisso's family for generations.

it has 21 strings and is made from
cow and antelope skins, although
today the strings are made from
nylon. The griot plucks the strings
with four fingers. while singing
tales of kings and queens from
long ago.

“The kora is a very important in-
strument," Susso said. ”it is used
to recount the tribal history of our
people. You do not go to a class»
room to learn to play the kora; you
learn at home. The music is not in
writing; the songs must all be
memorized."

Originally only those born to a
griot family could learn the kora,
but that is beginning to change. To-
day, women and people from other
families and cultures are learning
to play and are making it their pro-

In his lectures, Papa Susso di5r
cussed his music and explained his
background and the griot tradition
in his country. The Gambia is a
small nation on the coast of West
Africa, almost entirely surrounded
by Senegal. He told several stories
about his life and his homeland, ins
cluding what his name means and
how he chose to play the kora pro-
fessionally.

Susso has lived in New York for
the past 11 years, yet his conncce

Scarlet or Black - Friday. October 1 1. 1996

 

By LESLIE MADSEN
Arts Editor

On Friday, October 4, Lynne
Sadlck ‘85 gave a presentation
iitlcd “Cross-disciplinary Values in
the Arts and the Rewards of ‘Risky'
Professions,"

After graduating from Griiiiiell,
M5, Sadlek earned another B.A. der
gree and an M.F.A., both in art. She
has been involved in a number of
professions sometimes considered
“risky," including music, art, the—
aler, storytelling, radio newscasting
and other flCidS, Currently, she
spends her days Working In the
more stable atmosphere of investe
merit banking, but retums to her stue
the in the evenings to paint.

She described her home of
Williamsburg, Brooklyn zis a rising
cultural center, currently the dwell-
ing place of 5,000 artists, She said
Williamsburg's arts community is
extremely diverse, and offered as
evidence a recent day of open stu—
dios, where visitors were invited to
explore the worlds ofartists of vari
ous ages, genders, theories, atti-
tudes, and somability. She lauded
this “democratization. . . of the art
world.” '

During her lecture, Ms. Sadlek
challenged the acceptance of lim-
ited viewpoints. She emphasized
this theme through repetition ofthe
assertion “Ididn‘tchange my mind,
The facts shifted.“ Her enthusiasm
for her topic was evident as she
passed through the four “move-
ments” of her presentation,' which
were introduced by music spanning
cultures and centuries: from Beck
to Each to Nigerian Ju—Ju music.
She cited this last form as the cur
rent major influence on her work.

 

Lynne Sadlek ‘85
discusses ‘risky
business’ of art world

In addition, Ms. Sadlek shared
slides of her work and that of pre-
chaissance through twenLlethrcenr
tury artists. She focused on Lhe physi-
cal and psychological evolution of
point of view, commencing with a
discussron of single point perspective
and illiislrating the “breakdown of
that conceptual model." '

Ms. Sadlck encouraged her listen-
crs to become more aware of today‘s
widely accepted viewpoints and as-
sumptions. For example, she said
“that time can remain still" seems “an
incredible assumption" to her, as does
the supposition that anythin g outside
of the the center of a composition is
not as important as the central sub
ject or obyect, As she evolved as an
artist, she found herselfdouhtjng “the
fundamental assumptions of single
point perspective"

How can you assume," sheasked,
In a challenging tone, “that it's this
gravity that's holding" the world of
a composition together? She came
to understand that, in such works as
Bach’s Mass in B-Minor, the indie
vidual notes mattered less than their
“spatial orientation and movement."

Ms. Sadlek emphasized that, even
when people seem to be passive ob-
servers, “we're always constructing.
How one makes “sense of reality"
depends on intellectual “ordering”
and emotional construction," In or~
der to better understand oneself and
one’s surroundings, Ms. Sadlek im-
plied, one must recognize one's View-
point and challenge one's fundamen-
tal assumptions.

Ms. Sadlek said she chose paintr
ing because it is a “diﬁicult” medium,
one that offers “resistance." She
stressed that artists rarely have more
than a vague concept of what will be
the ﬁnished product of a work in
progress.
