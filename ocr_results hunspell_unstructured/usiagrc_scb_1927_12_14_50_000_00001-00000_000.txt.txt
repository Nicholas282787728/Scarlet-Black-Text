Annual Tournament Promises To
Be Series of Closely Con—
tested Games.

YEARLINGS MAY BE UPSET

'Will Award Medals of Standard
Design to Members of the
Winning Five.

Tlle annual inter-class basketball
tournament which opens tomorrow af-
ternoon promises to be one of the
closest ill the history of the event,

Contrary to the precedent set by the
freshmen teams of the last‘; few
tournaments when the yearlings have
come through unscathed. both the
sophomore and the junior teams may
upset the class of '31, while the sen-
iors are doped to give the lower class-
lneu a battle.

For the first time. lnedals, which
are of a standard design to be award—
ed to winners in inter-class and intros
mural sports from now on. will be
awarded to the members of the chains
pion five,

The tournament will be a round-
robin, to be played on Thursday, Fri—
day and Saturday afternoons as three
double bills, starting at four on the
first two days and two on the last
No admission is being charged.

The Juniors. captained by Russell
Gray, perhaps have the most implesss
ive five. Such men as Brooke Clifford.
Wiseman and Evahu, some of whom
were members of the 1929 yearling
squad, which was one of the strongest
in recent years, represent the third
year class. Perhaps the weakness of
the quintet will be in its jumping
center. No member of the teamialir
proachcs six feet. ‘

Captain Hoffman's squad of seniors,
while it lacks outstanding players, is
making every atenlpt to overcome this
handicap by developing a smooth ma—
macbine. Jacobson. Lothrop Smith,
Hallstead, and Laird are the best men
on the squad.

Sophomore Sirougtli Unknown.

Sophomore strength is the least
known. In the captain, the team has
a good center or forward while the
rest of the squad is making its initial
appearance on the floor. Klinefelter
and Bradley eerootszli stars, are said
to he mainstays.

The yearling squad is composed of
the largest men. It is possible to pick
a team of s footers from it. Perhaps
the best players are Humphrey, Miner,
Ferguson, Bowie and Douglas.

The tournament is sponsored by the
intramural department and is being
managed by Elton Follett.

UNCONFIRMED DOPE INDICATES THAT
KANSAS WISHES VALLEY REVAMPING

With every one wondering about the
outcome of the athletic situation, ares
smile of the facts of several past hap-
penings scam to point to the fact that
some radical chaugcs are about to
tulrc place. Authorities are noncom—
mltzll on anything ullicll would in
any way be arbitrary but they are
willing to suppose with the rest, guidv
ed. of course. by a little inside tiopc.

Probably the most interesting fact
for supposition is that a school .has
written asking that all invitations to
Join the revamped Missouri Valley
conference he withheld Who is this
school? Local authorities assume that
air of “if you guess , we’ll gasp, but
we can't tell you point blank."

Upton Close Sponsoring Student
Delegation to Far East; to
Cost Small Amount.

New York, (By New Student Serr
Vice)71‘he first American student
tour of the Orient. at student
rates, and under expert supervision is
in prospect for next summer. Spou-
soring this venture, which has for its
purpose the introduction of American
students to Japan, China, ilanchuria
and Korea, is Upton Close (Josef
Washington Hail) outstanding author--
ity on Asia, and author of many books
dealing with the Far East. The
New Strident, interested in this cn-
deavor to broaden the student field of
interest and information is lending its
name and support to the program,
which will be designated to tbe Upton
CloserNelv student tour of thc Orient.
100 to Make Trip.

As outlined by Mr Close, about 100
students will be selected from the ap—
plicants to make the trlp. Neither
tourists nor “remittance men,” stu»
dents sent by parents who wish to
keep John or Jim out of sight for the
summer, will be accepted, Only men
will be taken next summer, although
in following years tours may be ar-
ranged for women also.

Mr. Close, by virtue of his acquaint-
ance with state officials in the lands
to be visited, has obtained special con-
cessions that that make the transport
costs unusually low. At the same time,
the foreign offices of these countries
have given the program their official
approval. Close and several students
covered the territory last summer.

To Begin M Seattle.

As now planned the tour will begin
and end at Seattle, Washington, and
will consume about ten weeks. The
start will he made some time between
June 15 and ‘30, and the return be-
tween September 10 and 15. Japan,
f‘hiua, Manchuria and Korea will be
visited under the guidance of Mr,
Close and other qualified leaders, The
students will for the most part be
placed on their own responsibility, and
no attempts will be made to dictate
their interests. They will live in nat-
ive style or the countries they visit,
and in each place will be afforded op»
portunlty to pursue their special in-
terests. For instance, Japan will be
visited on two separate occasions, for
two week periods. During the first
the students will be made acquainted
with how to eat. sleep, bathe and get
about, and on the return visit, they
will be free to follow their own bcnts,
and to examine such aspects of the
country, and such’ places, as partictk
larly interest them. This plan will he
followed throughout, and everything
done to make the expedition different
from the usual tourists programs.

To Hold Conferences.

On board the special ship which will
be set aside to carry the group, Mr.
Close will hold informal conferences
on the countries to be visited, and
will have on hand, and suggest, spec-
ially selected reading on phases specs
inlly interesting individual students,

The whole trip is expected to cost
between $325 and $315. This will in-
clude transportation, food. lodging,
and entertainment. The profit motive
is emphatically being omitted, Mr.
Close is requiring enough margin
merely to provide for the transporta»
tion, food, lodging, and possibly some
entertainment for himself and the
group of assistants who will be head

Grinnell fans and to Coach Tl'ucsflale.

true indication of what may be expects

That Gl'innell is to have a "Follies"
show this _ car was passed by tho Dra—
matic council last night and decided
upon by the Sigma Delta chi chapter
Sunday. The show is to be an all-
college production and is to be spon-
sored by the Sigma Delta Chi, working
in co-operation with the Dramatic
council,

The production is to he put on a
competitive basis and the sum of one

in the men's dormitories and one cut-
tage in the girl's quadrangle combine
in presenting a fifteenrininute act
of a nature in keeping with the light
or vaudeville nature of the show.
This would make a lull evening's bill
of six acts. there being twelve cot-
tages and balls altogether. The name
her in each act is tentatively limited
to eight persons, unless special dis—
pensations are allowed in the case of
choruses.

With some metropolitan theatrical
producer acting as a judge, the win-
ning act is to be awarded fifty dol—
lars, the second best thirty dollars,
and the third twenty dollars.

No Name Yet

The date for the Show has not yet
been definitely set, but it is thought
that the production will take‘ place
March 23 or thei'eiihouts. Neither has
a definite name been selected. -It Will
probably be termed “The Grinnell Fol-
lies," "The Grinnell Gambols," or some
such name. Since the chapter of Sig—
ma Delta Chi plans to make this an
annual allrcollege affair. if successful,
the name Will probably be carefully
considered before being definitely de—
tinitely chosen.

proposition and to either elect or
appoint committee Chairmen to take
charge of the act for their own build-

mittee. The acts need not be original,
but such are preferable.
