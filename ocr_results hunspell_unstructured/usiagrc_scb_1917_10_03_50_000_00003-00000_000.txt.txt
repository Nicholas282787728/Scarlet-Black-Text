A proposed change in the constitu—
tion of the self-government league,
involving changes in the evening
study hours, was presented to the
girls by the president ol the s. G. L.
at their ﬁrst business meeting llonr
day night,

At. present study hours for the
Quadrangle ar- , 7:309:30 in the eve-
ning. Doors are locked at 10 and
light: are out at 10:30.

The proposed change is to make
the study hours trorn s to 10, with
the cct'eulion hour before the study
DE ed instead of alter, as it now is,
Doors will close at 10 as tlsual, and
lights will be out at 10:13.

The adoption of these changed
hours may make some change in the

Pr s. Main Says ill Vesper
War Is I'

President Main deﬁned in his \'BS*
per-
struggle in the development uf lite,

“Is war essential in the ﬁnal de—
velohrncnt of the race?" he asked.
"No, it is but a passing incident in
life. War with machine guns and
poisonous gases will pass away as

but struggle-wilt continue. It is all»
soliitely not necessary in the per-teet-
ing or tile.

“Jesus hiniseli," President Main
pointed out, “was a man of peace,
but he was no paciﬁst. Jesus, the
Prince of Peace, and Jesus who came
not to bring peace but the sword are
not irreconcilable,

“Tllc supreme struggle,” he said
conclusion, “tlluL winch will never-l

e, is the struggle or man to
realize the apt t at God."
