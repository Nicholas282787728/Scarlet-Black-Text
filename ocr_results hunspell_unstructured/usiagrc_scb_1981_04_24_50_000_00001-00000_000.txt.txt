by Kim MacDonald

The six months of controversy, confu-
sion and uncertainty centering on the
proposal to move onecarnpus health ser»
vices t0 Grinnell General Hospital are
over and Younker Memorial Health
Center will remain open on campus

The decision to shelve the proposal
was reached during the past month by
Executive Vice-President Waldo
Walker and Vice-President and Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Tederman as a'
result of their discussion with the
hospital board and student reaction
against the move,

Cost. student reaction and the
hospital's inability to provide the level
of services the college requires were
the primary reasons the college opted
not to move the Health Center, Tederr
man. who received a student petition
earlier this year against the move. ex-
plained, “An awlul lot 0! students like
the convenience at on—campus health
services and as long as we can maintain
a health center with that convenience
we Should."

While there was not “any one specific

servme "

ble. Michael Faas, a hospital ad-
ministrator, explained that a hospital
would be unable to provide the kind oi
service the college wants. “Because 0!
rules and regulations governed by the
state we have to be stricter than the
Health Center," Faas noted.

In the same vein, Tederman did not
believe “the hospital could provide bet-
ter or more services than we can
presently provide." One problem was
the need (or a physician to supervise
the hbsiptal nurses 24 hours a day it the
Health Center had been moved “The
very nature or its being a hospital would
require much more doctor supervision
than we originally thought," said
Tederman Although he said. "Cost was
not a problem" since the talks never
progressed that tar, there do seem to be
ﬁnancial considerations involved.

Faas also noted the ne_e_d tor a lull

time supervising doctor but claimed
that when it “came down to dollars and
cents. . . we couldn't afford a full-time
doctor and the college didn't have the
money " The only ﬁnancial considera-
tion that Tederman cited was the exe
pense ol shuttles to transport students
to and from the hospital, Faas, on the
other hand, claimed the school was “a
little ticklist about money."

Another consideration was the op.
nion oi the town doctors who, according
to Tederman, felt the students would be
better served with the present
tacilities, No new changes are envision»
ed for the Health Center in the near
future. According to Tederman, they
are currently doing as much as they
can, given the liabi ties involved and
any improvements in services would
entail a big increase in student health
tees Both Irma Hall and Donna Bailey

at the Health Center and the staff there

let the Health Center remain at its cur-
