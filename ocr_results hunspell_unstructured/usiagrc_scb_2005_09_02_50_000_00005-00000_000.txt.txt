A: I rode in a bus to Grinnell from the Des
Moincs airport, I said to myself, “Why is everything
so annoyingly green? Where are the skyscrapers?
The subway? The flvtrstory malls? Where are they?"
When I dreamt of college,I saw development at its
best. Instead, I was observing a nevertchanging plaSt
ter of green.

I come from a strivrng Central American nation
called Honduras. 1 have lived there all my life, but I
am tnrly part Mexican
and part Arab. Back home
I have been exposed to a
mishmash ofcultures, so I
miss everything from the
way we greet t With one
kiss, and sometimes two
- to the food.

I was distracted from
some orthcse thoughts as
I introduced myself to all
the international students
on the bus. Some came from France, others from Nit
geria, several from China and others from countries I
thought only existed on atlases and globes.

Itwas at this precise momentwhen I realized why
Grinnell was the college of my choicehbecause ofits
diversity.

the scarlet and black

I An international student’s first glimpse
l of rural America

on campus, as I forgot the names and faces oflots or
people I mer,I realized that Grinnell’s best asset is its
people. The student population is so diverse that you
can become acquainted with so many cultures. Evt
erybody is so open to different ideas and new things
that it enables you to express yourself freely Without
fearing any sort ofjudgment.

Grinncll‘s best asset, its people, also goes beyond
its student population. Grinnell is so special because
of its faculty, its custodl‘
ans, its SAs, its deans, its
RLCs, its nurses and all
those people that go unt
noticed but help smooth
your transition into col—
lege.

As I curse and swear
my way up to the fourth
floor of Norris, I realize
that no matter how much
the food sucks, that no
matter how painful I find.thi: four ﬂights of stairs, I
am where I want to bc.I am in the place that best suits
me in this turmoil of growing up.

Ihave never experienced frostbite,hypothermia, or
any of the other usual features of surviving an Iowan
winter,but here I am,willing to take it all with a mind
free ofprcjudices and a heart full of excitement.

A thousand fiery suns

The Concept of Grinnell, if you will, is never ret
ally realized during the freshman year. The first year
is simply too filled with newness and first impres-
sions to grasp what's going on. Ofcourse,1 can't say
that the rest ofus Pioneers know either. Our lives are
composed of racing about campus, frantically scribe
bling down homework

between meals and clubs
and loves and beers. How
can anyone come to grips
with reality in this “well-
rounded" liberal arts ex-
petience, let alone on four
hours of sleep a night?
Maybe that’s why we get
such long breaks, time for
a little introspection. As a
junior returning from an-
other 8tt<>t5 summer, I would like to think that at
least some truths about Grinnell have dawned on my
horizon.

First, our ample endowment and excruciating
tuition costs presumably make life in Grinnell pret-
ty good. our facilities are generally up to date, our
professors are usually knowledgeable and concerned
about their pupils, and we have at least some vague
form of inﬂuence on the administration’s decisions,

John Guittar

These are very good things. Apparently, we’re now
poised to be successful and progressive members of
society. Regardless of this, however, as everyone here
eventually finds our, life in Grinnell College is actu-
ally about the people we're surrounded by. I love ev-
eryone here with the passion ofa thousand fiery suns.
I love the girl who spends
her summers doing plant
taxonomy in Virginia, the
y who works on a farm
in Iceland, and the girl
with perfect pitch across
the hall. Grinnell has
always had a history or
strong personalities, and
this, more than anything
else is my reason for sticks
ing around.
so, here I am, ready for another year full of ac-
tion. Of course it will be gone before I know it,just
like everything else out there. But I do know that I've
made the proper mental arrangements. My eyes will
be open, my mind will be ready, and I will be perched
to collect and savoi the maximal ﬂavor; not with the
hopes that I‘ll know what I'm doing as it occurs, but
that I’ll have the memories and evidence of the expat
Ariencc when I finish.

“Are you excited to go back to school?" I cannot
tell you how many people asked mt: this the last week
I was home. This was my answer: "Eli. . .I guess."

The truth was my first year had completely burned
mt: out. In my paranoia that this school was going to
be too hard, I had completely exhausted myself

Of course I was excited to see my friends but the
work? No, thank you.

I was having a fabulous time at home. My boy-
friend was wrth me; I lounged by the pool every day
and ate fabulous food every night. Why would I want
to go back to school.>

This was completely different from last summer
when I could not wait to drive across country and
start my new life,

The jour»
ney to Iowa
was the same
as always.
The land
turned from
m o u n t a i n t
ous terrain
to ﬂatter and
ﬂatter farm-
land. After landing in Des Moines, I found my suit-
cases and sat outside the airportwriiting for my ride.
He arrived and after shoving all my belongings in to
his already crowded car, we set off for Gr'mnell.

It was stmngeidespitc the fact that we had
been separated for three months the car ride back
wasn't awkward at all. When we arrived at school,
my roommate and I exchanged hugs and immedit
ately began jabbering away as usual. Throughout the
night, familiar faces peeked through my doorway to
make plans.

However, before the weekend two crucial days
still loomed ahead: Thursday and Friday We had
to go to class and I was not ready to start the slew
of homework I knew was coming. But when the
time came I seemed to jump right in to the swing
of things.

In fact, starting school again was easier than ever,
There was no awkvmrdness in classes as to where I
should sir; I knew which dorm was mine, and I al-
ready had friends to go to meals with. Even doing
homework came easily.

So, although I was not looking forward to coming
back to Grinncll, the transition has made me realize
once again that I made the right choice some twelve
months ago and this is indeed the place for me.

on my second day in crinneu I
started going shoeless again for the
usual reason: I had lost my shoes some
where in my room, By the fifth day my
room was in such a state that it provrdt
ed adequate habitat for wild life. That
morning, and by morningI mean mid-
afrernoon,1awokc to find a furry cat-
erpillar crawling across the debris. I put
him in ajar and named him Milton.

"Like the author," friend Siobhan
commented That wasn’t what I was
thinking when I named him. I was
thinking the ﬂuffy white spikes on
his head made him look like a Milton.
“Yeah,"I said. Siobhan and I were at-
tempting to barbeque, and while our
attempt to cook meat failed miserably,

we had a good chat about our return to about a pla

blc. But there is something comforting

iobhan agreed that it is time

shoeless talking to a caterpillar in ajar

“You're getting boring Milton," I
say. “Turn into a beauti-
ful butterfly already Shut
up, Milton, we’re talking
about your problems, not
mine."Or ifthey do, they
smile and say “Hey, how's
it gomg?" not “Where are
your shoes?" or “Freak”
or “I’m going to have to
ask you to leave, ma’am.”
And ofcourse I will miss
all the other great, quirky

That's a lie. I Will miss the five or so
great quirky people that have become
my close friends, The rest of the great

quirky people are starting to annoy me.
And don’t get me started on the first
years with cell phones,

This is the sort ofjaded babble that
is common between jaded seniors like
Siobhan and me. I wonder if we protest
too much. I think I may be covering
something up with all this “next person
who tells me how they got soooo drunk
last night gets punched in the facc"att
titude. Maybe next year I'll be sitting
wherever it is I will sit after graduiit
tion (At a desk? Somewhere in Africa?
Trailer park?) and think, “Man, it has
been a long time since someone ran by
linked." And then I will shed a tear for
Grumcll, and wish I hadn’t spent the
majority of my senior year convincing
myself I wouldn't,
