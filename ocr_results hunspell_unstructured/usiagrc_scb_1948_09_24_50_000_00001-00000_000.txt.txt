Chief Execuﬁve Holds
Degree From Grinnell

 

and gentlemen, it
gives me great pleasure to in-
troduce a distinguished ‘alumnus
of Grinnell college, the Presi-
dent of the United States."

“I am a synthetic alumnus.
Grinne‘ll gave me the first hon-
orary degree I have ever had.
and 1 treasure it ahovc all others
1 have received since.”

The Scarlet and Black. in a
[olloweup of the presidential
appearancc in Gi-innell last Sat-
urday, visited President Stevens'
office Wednesday to learn the
details and background preced:
ing the event. Dr. Stevens, ques-
tiond on his reaction to riding on
the presidential train from Iowa
City, said,

"Why, 1 have known Mr. Tru-
nian for some time.”

President Stevens has scrvcd

on an advisory committee for thei

reorganization of governmental
bureaus under the late President
Roosevelt, and is still on call in
a professional capacity. During
the course of his work he met
the then Senator Truman and

worked with him on several occae
sions.

 

 

 

 

 

   

Presidrnt Truman,
antl friend.

Dr. Stevens

 

When the association of Wash-
ington correspondents in 1944
voted Mr. Truman the man who
had contributed most to the hat
ioiial interest, Dr. Stevens place
his name before the faculty and
the hoard of trustees for an hon-
orary degree. He then had the
task of persuading Mr. Truman
to accept the honor, overcoming
his objection that he was not a
formally educated nian.

Learning that the President
was en route through loiva, Drl

Stevens phoned to request a stopl

at Grlmloll, In return, the Pres-
ident asked that Dr. Stevens
board the presidential train.
After accepting the invitation,
D Stevens hastily conferred
with‘ state and county
of the Democratic partypand the

 

    

stage was set for the event
