Television station sale finally comes through

Endowment gains by $35 million after discrimination charges rejected

by Anne Rawland

\lter more than a year of negotiations
and unsuccessful charges oi discrimina»
tion, Grinnell College holds approximately
$35 million more in endowment funds and
the Hearst Corporation owns another
television station,

The proceeds brought by the sale oi sta-
tion WDTN, located in Dayton, Ohio, boosts
Grinnell's total endowment to about 386
million. “On a per student basis we're
tGrlnnellJ one or the top to or 20 tbest-
endowed institutionsl iii the nation." said
VicePresidenl and Treasurer of the Coir
lege Robert Anderson.

The Grinnell CDmmunlCathnS COl'pOr'A'
tion, a subsidiary of the college managed
by the Board of Trustees, bought the station
tori 2.9 million in 1976. On August H. 1980
the Grinnell Corporation reat: ed an
‘ agreement between our iwo parties after
Hearst made an otter to buy. said Anders
son About the Initiation of the sale Anders
son explained, "We were willing to sell but
not actively seeking to dispose oi thc sta»

tion." He went. on to say the trustees were
thinking about selling the station anyway
because, “a large percentage of the value
(of Grinnell‘s endowmentl was in one
asset,"

Grinnell iirst purchased the station as a
"hedge against inilation,” said Anderson.
"AVCO Corporation was disposing oi their
media and it's not often that TV tations
come on the market,“ AVCO is a rinanacial
corporation which invests in a variety oi
diiierent commodities,

in an article published in the August do.
1980 issue at the 53th President George
Drake said the trustees had originally plans
ned to keep the s hon ior 25 years but ac
cepted llears-t's oi'ier tor two reasons lie
cited the value oi the station. which he
claimed as comprising on ali oi the en
dowment The second reason. said the arti-
cle, “was a iceling that the large growth
period may be over tor tele sion stations "

Although the trustees had hoped to con

plete the transaction between January and
April oi this year, the FCC license transfer
approval was held up by a petition tiled
against the Grinnell Coporation, rcc apr
proval came in midsummer with the ac
tual transter oi iunds occurring Sept. 9

Anytime the transier oi a televiston star
tion occurs the FCC must approve it or the
new owner will not be licensed to operate
According to Anderson the process usually
takes Six months or more and approval
centers on monopoly considerations and
public opinion in the case oi WDTN Anoeiz
son said. ' It‘s hard to tell how much time
was tied up in transiei- tbureaucrneyi and
how much in other things "

The petition, tiled by- the Dayton chapter
oi the ohio Black Political Assembly and
the luiisterial Economic Development
Association. cited the Grinnell Corporation
as discriminating in two general areas The
iirst category included employment and
promotion practices while thc second

claimed programming det' encies The
FCC ruled in lavor oi Grinnell in both
cases.

When asked what the increased endow
ment means in terms 0] college im-
provements Anderson said, "1 think we'll
start providing ior our physical plant“
Specifically. he noted upkeep and renewal
so Grinnell will “stay more on top oi
things" Thus, he added. “It major pro»
olems do occur we'll have money
However. Anderson stressed the trustees
have made no speciiic plans ior the in
creased revenue

When questioned why the Hearst Corr
poration pursued the Grinnel] holding in
particular. Anderson replied. "Hearst has
been . eachly acquiring T\ anti rtl’iiti s- .
tions In the last 18 months ’
