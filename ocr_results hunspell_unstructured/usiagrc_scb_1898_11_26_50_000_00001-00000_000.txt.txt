Drake wins.

Notwithstanding the inclement
weather over 1500 people
nessed the Thanksgiving game at
Des Moilles between Drake Uni-
versity and Grinnell. Straw had
been placed along the srdelines so
that most of the spectators pre-
ferred standing there to taking a
seat in the amphitheatre. but
from the occasional roar that
came from the latter place, occas-
sioned by the stamping oi teet,
one recognized that there were
many who were in the amphi-
theatre. The blue and ivliite of
rDrake were of course in predom-
inance. but Grinnell had many a
sympathizer even among those
who make Des Moines their
home. and at times in the game it
seemed as though the wearers or
the scarlet and black were really
in preponderance rrom tlreyells
which arose as Grinneii made
yard after yard through Drake's
mountain-like line.

Grinncll's men played rvith
reckless abandon at every stage
otthe game but their lightmcn
could not endure the battering oi
the mammoths who constituted
Drake's team. During the ﬁrst
half Grinnell outplayed hcr op»
patient but on such grounds as
the ones on which Thursday's
game was played “beef" counts
and as weight is one of the eles
mcnts which enter into the mak-
ing or a good football team, so we
must admit that the team which
was the better under the con»
ditions in which the game was
played, was the one which won
the game. i ’

Grinnell lost the toss and was
forced to kick off, but although
Drake had possession of the ball
it soon become evident that they
were notto keep it long. Inside
of two minutes they had lost the
ball and although Grinnell was
soon forced to punt Drake imr
mediately afterward lost the ball
on offside play. After failing to
gain around the end Peirce nrade
a well placed punt which Sellard's
fumbled allowing Frisbie to secure
the ball. Burd was sent around
the end ror three yards and line
bucks by Wheeler and Peirce
netted four yards. Here the ball
