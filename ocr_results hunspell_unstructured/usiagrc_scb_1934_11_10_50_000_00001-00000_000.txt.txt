Ruling Bodies
Offer Revised
Training Plans

Faculty Group to Consider
Prepping Programs
at Next Meeting

In espouse to the request of the
adm' istration committee, boththestu-
dent council and the Council of House
Presidents have drawn up a list of
recommendations to be considered by
the faculty group when it meets next
week to take action on the freshman
probation program.

According to President John s. Nol-
len, who heads the committee, some
sort of modification of the present pro.
gram is certain, and it was the wish
of the committee to have these two
campus organizations offer the stu—
dents' attitude upon the matter.

Opinions Vary

A wide variance of opinion between
the student council and the Council
of House Presidents is revealed in the
suggestions which the two groups
plan to submit to _the administrative
body. In general, the letter council
desires that the probation program re.
main essentially the .same as in the
past, whereas the student governing
body will recommend a number at
rather radical departures from the
existing plan,

Both groups request that paddling
in limited form be retained as a fea-
ture of semi»annual probation periods.
According to a statement this morn.
ing by Richard Kuncl, student coun»
cil president, the body which he heads
will further rcconunend a definite plan
to assure that paddling shall, not be
carried to extremes.

Funny Dis Linc

“Any-infraction of this rule,” he ex.
plained, “would be subject to disci—
pline, of the administrative com—
mittee, even to the extent of suspen.
sion from schoo ."» l

The student council included in its
recommendations the proposal that
future probation periods be restricted
to a single all—night Session.

A third major change in the present
program which the above group in.
tends to suggest, Kuncl explains as
follows: “The house’ presidents shall
submit complete plans for their Semi»
annual weekends of intensive "fresh-
man training” to a committee made up
of student council members appointed
by the president of the council, to pro.
vent the administration of any indig»
nities upon the freshmen.”

Make No Suggestions

The Council of House Presidents
states that an attempt should be made
to overcome the most highly objection.
able features of the last probation per»
iod, but offers no specific suggestions
as to they enforcement of the re.
strictions,

In commenting on the recommenda»
tions of the men's council, its presi.
dent, Marion Frye, stated yesterday
that the dormitory board believes the
primary features of past probation
periods should be retained, declaring,
"lf it is impossible for us to continue
these features, we feel that it is wise
to drop the custom altogether,”

Presiden Nollen said this morning
that the day for the next meeting of

' the administration cann-nitteo has not
been set.

Birthday of Mme. Curie
Observed by French Club

The fact that it was the sixty-Sev-
coth anniversary of the birth of Mme
Curie, discoverer of the clemc‘nt
'radium, was commented on by Roberta
Caldwell, president, in opening the
meeting of the French club Wellness
day evening. All conversation at the
meetings was in French.

Because there has been an unusual
interest taken in the club it is hoped
that more will be accomplished this
year than last, accordingto Miss Cald.

Director of Debate Urges
All Men interested
to Report

t meeting of the Grinnell
_,ub will be held in room
o'clock. Wednesday evening in room
116 second floor Alumni Recitation
hall, it was announced today by Max
Hunn, director of debate. All men
interested in varsity debating are or.
ged to attend the meeting.

This winter, as was done for the
first time last year, there will be no
freshman team, but insteadfirst year
men will be allowed to participate
with upper classmen. All men who
turn out for debate will be given an
opportunity to engage in at least one
outside debate, l-lunn explained,

20 to 25 chaics

The schedule this ycar will prob.
ably include between 20 and 25 debat-
es. It is hoped that several radio dcr
bates can be arranged during the
season. Last year the team engaged
in debates over stations wol at Ames,
KWCR at Cedar Rapids, and Wm
at Waterloo. Efforts are being made
to secure time, over these stations in
either January or February;

Requests for debates with Grinneli
this year have been received from
the University of Southern California
at i'aos Angcles, from Rockhurst col.
lege at Kansas City, Mo. and from
several other schools.

Negotiations are already under way
for the scheduling of debates between
Cornell college at Mt. Vernon, Knox
college at Galesburg, lll., Iowa State
Teachers college, at Cedar Falls.

Creighton, Drake

Other schools which Grinnell will
probably meet this year will be
Creighton, Drake, University of Du.
buque, Dcloit, Penn, and Coe.

Most of the debates this year will
center around the questions of inter-
nau'onal shipment of arms and collec.
uve bargaining, Hunn stated.

BESSEY, FULTON ADDED

Two more members have been add—
ed to the news staff of The Scarlet
and Black since announcement of the
fall selections ‘in Wednesday's issue.
Helen Louise Bessey, '37, and Mar—
guel'ite Fulton, '37, are the new re.
porters.

Both Clark, Dibble

on 1934 All-Dormitory Speedball Team

on each of the other positions. McCul-
ly, Frye, Mason, and Wise were given
the honor for the second time, having
been mentioned in the all-dormitory
list last year.

To Hal Dean and James Riley went
the honor of being the only freshmen
given positions on Either of (he first
two teams.

A check of the game records re.
veals that McCully was high scorer
for the season with 23 points, while
Royal, who was placed on the second
eleven, was second with 17. MCMur—
ray scored 15 points to land in third
while Slye tied with Evans of Smith,
with eight points, Frye accounted for
seven points; Mason ﬁve, Rigan five
and Dean five. '

In analyzing the records of teams,
the superiority of the championship
Dibble team stands out clearly. The
northenders rolled up 62 points against
their opposition, more than twice the
total of any other team. Their goal
was crossed for only 10 points. Raw-
son held its oponcuts to 12, closely ap.
preaching Dibblo's record on defense.

That Raw/son’s defense functioned
consistently well is shown by the fact
that but one ﬁeld goal was scored
against it. Twenty-nine points were
scored against Clark, 38 against Lari.
gen, 40 against Smith, and 45 against
Gates.

Smith was second in points scored
with 30. Clark gathered 28, Rawson
25, Langan 16, and Gates 13,
