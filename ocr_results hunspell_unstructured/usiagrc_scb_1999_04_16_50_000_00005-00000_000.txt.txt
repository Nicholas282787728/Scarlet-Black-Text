Searlcs 8 Black . Friday, Agni 76 OPINION 5

Barsli Day is next week. of course, socicry deals wish environmensal
issues every day ofrhe year, so in a sense designasing one day as Earth Day is
beside she poinr. on she osher hand, Earth week on campus is a good simc
so raise awareness abous shese ongoing issues. iris also a good simc so reflecs
on where she “environmental movemens" ssands and where is is headed.

Lass week, she Rosenfseld Program broughs a number ofspeakers so cam.
pus so discuss issues of biorechnology in agriculsure. Dennis T. Avery gave
she Convocasion lecsure. He is die Diseesor of Global Food issues as she
Hudson 1nsrisuse and she aushor ofshe book saving she World wish Pcsrir
sides and Plassics. As you mighs surmise from his book rislc, he views bio-
sechnology and pessicides favorably He argues shas insensive farming in she
us, including ersensive use ofpessicides and generically alscred producss, is
she only way we can feed she world and save wilderness as die same sime. 1
found shas 1 did nor agree with Mr. Avery's views or presensasion of“fzcts"
abous shis issue. In my ners column 1 will address his above ssased argumens
and review the legacy of DDT, which he sold me was never conclusively
proven to harm bird populasions.

Mr. Avery sold me abous DDT during a luncheon held in Grinnell House
afser his lecsure. Unfor'sunasely, shose of us assending she luncheon had so
wais in she lobby forawhile so Mr. Avery could shower. No,

Mr. Avery did nos work up a horrible swear, and he is nos
obsessive compulsive abous his cleanliness. He showered so
rid himselfofshe brown pie shas was plasscred so his head.

\What I saw was this: a man wearing a ski mask ensered
shrough she back ofshe Herrick Chapel ssage, crops up be.
hind Mr. Avery as she podium, and firmly squashed a pie
down upon Ms. Avery's head. The assailans ran our of
Herrick, followed by a few pursuers. The ress of us sas in
shock, while Mr. Avery calmly removed she aluminum pie
sin from his head. “Well, mask a new experience for me,” he
said. Then he explained so us shas such acrions rake place
when people ges frussrased bus do nos have she srush on
shcis side, and he proceeded wish she quession/answcr session, We gave him
a ssanding ovasion. 1 was impressed wish his handling of die sisuasion.

I am treating the incident seriously in this column, mainly because there
was norhing funny abous is, as anyone who was shere can assess, 1 realize shas
shis pic on she head was in many ways iusr an immasure prank. The harm
done so Ms. Averywas slighs. A shower, and perhaps a newsuis. ssill, dump-
ing a pie on Ms. Averys head was cersainly an acs of aggression, and that 1
cannor suppors or condone,

When I wisncssed she pie assack, 1 saw is as iuss shas. An assack. Nos
acsivisni. cessainly nos burniliarion, eisceps humiliasion for she assacker.
Rasher, is digniﬁed she speaker. By accepsing she pie and fighsing back ver—
bally sashes shan physically, Ms. Avery elevased himselfabove she sisuasion,
Since 1 believe he advocascs environmensal dessrucsion based on faulrylogic,
manipulasion offacss, and oussighs lies, 1 was disgussed by she surn ofcvcnss.
is was difficulr so argue widi a man who had been given an ooay crown of
marryrdorn.

According so she s & B, she Bioric Baking Brigade was responsible for
. this assauls, aided by as leasr one Grinnell College ssudens. The Biosic Bak-
ing Brigade apparcnsly feels shas an cffecsive way so raise environmensal
awareness is so dump pics on she heads of speakers wish whom rhey dis-
agree. Perhaps shey are righs, bus 1 would question wherher or nos she envi-
ronmensal movemens really wanrs shas sort of“awasencss." .

More and more, some people adhere so she mansra of ”any press is good
press.” The beliefis shas virsually any acsion which raises awareness ofenvir
ronmensal issues is iussified. 1 casinos see how a view ofrhe ends justifying
she means can lead so reaching shose rreasured ends.

1 am nos aminss acsivism per se. Indeed 1 was ssoubled shas Mr. Avery
rousincly answered concerns abous hispolicics wish variasioris along she sheme
of‘Thar’s The wayThings Ase, so Ger used To is." Massin Lushes Kingir

Letters to the Editor

Dear Edisor and anyone else inseressed,

This lesser is in response so Marjena Sloan’s lesser lass Friday. 1 believe a
ecap ofshe issue is in order. The week before break, Quad dining hall mislabeled
he soup during special dinner. ls was labeled vegan, and as is rurns ous is was

os even vegcsarian. ingredienss included bosh beef far and beef srork. Arser
.coplc complained about she soup, I wens inso she kischen‘ and discovered
cuad’s missake.

I would like so shank Quad for responding so my lesser, iwish shey would
espond as quickly so my suggessions in she dining hall. 1wrose my lass lesser so
nform she campus onuad's missake and 1 do nos shink irwas in she leass bis
‘sascassic or cassy." The dining halls did nos just “gross our non—meat eases,"
hey made some vegans and vegesasians unwillingly and unknowingly violase
heir eshical codes. Moss vegans and vegerarians do nos ear meas because is is
uneshical, nor because is “grosses" shem ous. Our reasoning is nos as srisc as

s, Sloan makes is our so be. In addision, as consumers, we have she righs so
ow whas we are easing. By mislabeling she soup as special dinner, Quad
oppressed shis sighs. Surely, is was a niissake, bus is should be saken seriously.
in my opinion, shis incidenr as Quad is just anosher quessionable acs of
sining services. 1 am nos referring so she rumors abous squirrels and osher
rinnclliokes, i asri speaking from experience. I worked as a cooks help as
owles lass year, and I was appalled as whas she kischen refers so as “vegan and
egesarian food." Cersainly, is would he a big invessmens for she college so
ake a sruly vegan opsion available shrough dining services.

Buying all new cooking wear, usensils and ssovcs would be a pain. However,
s Mariena arid oshers in she Dining services fail so realise, Veganism is a way of
ife, nor iuss whas one chooses so ear. Juss because a food is made ofporaso, is
s nor ausomasically considered vegan. lfshis food is cooked wish meas or dairy,
.n she same ssove as mcar or dairy, in a pan that has cooked meas or dairy, or
-vcn cooked in she same oil as meas or dairy, is is nos vegan. Lass year while 1

as a cook’s help, 1 was asked so cook chicken nuggess in hosh fryers. Afser
cleaning" our she fryers (mainly removing she big chunks of food, burning

yself and washing down she sides of she fryer) French fries were cooked in
his oil she next day and labeled vegan Since shese French fries were cooked in
he came oil as chicken, shey are nos vegan in any way shape or form. Juss like
nislabeling she soup, shis labeling is incorrecs and unaccepsable.

Perhaps a ssricsly vegan board plan could be offered so srudenss in she fu—
urc. For now, gerring a fryer shas is purely vegan and cleaned separasely from
he non-vegan frycr would be a good goal. Also, really wasching how shings are
abclcd would be a good ssarr. Here are some producss you need so look ous
or besides she becfssock and far you forgos so nosice.

am proud so be maladjusrcd and so which i call upon you so be
maladiusscd...cod grans shar we will be so maladjussed shas we will be able
so go our and change our world and our civilization.”

lfone looks as she environmensal movemens, one can see shas much of
iss acsivism ssems from she ideology ofnonviolens resissance, originared by
Ghandi and adopsed in shis counsry by Massin Lusher king, Jr.

anironmensalisss use many sacsics which have roors in she civil righss
movemens: prosessingwish signs, parsicipasing in sir ins as eorporaso offices
and governmens buildings, chaining shemselves so srees, and so on. It is
clear, however, shas some environmensal acsivisrs have abandoned she idea
ology ofnon-violcnce. In facs, in some cases shcy have become she aggres—
sors. This reversal of roles is dissurbing, for is opens she possibilisy shas
environmensal ”activists" could end up doing more harm so she environ»
mens shan she people shey assack, due so erosion ofpublic suppors. such
suppors is she ssrongessweapon cnvironrnensalisss possess. It should nor be
abused. Massin Lusher Kingjr. assiculased a clear rasionale for why nonvio.
lens civil disobedience is more effecsive dian reaesions ofhase and anger:

“First, shis is nor a rneshod for cowards; is does resiss.
The nonviolens resisser is just as ssrongly opposed so she
evil againss which he prosesss as is she person who uses
violence. His meshod is passive or non-aggressive in she
sense shas he is nos physically aggressive soward his oppo.
nens. Bus his mind-and ernorions are always acsive, con»
ssansly seeking so persuade she opponens shas he is mise
taken... '

“A second poins is shas nonviolens resissance does nos
seek so defeas or humiliare she opponens, bus so win his
friendship and underssanding...

“A shird characserissic ofrhis meshod is shas she assack
is directed against forces of evil rather than against persons who are caught
in shose forces...

“A foursh poins shas muss be broughs ous concerning nonviolens resis-
sance is shas is avoids nos only exsernal physical violence bur also inscrnal
violence ofspirir."

And in anosher speech:

“So we can read or we can hear she Lenins say shas lying, deceis, or
violence, shas many of shese shings iussify she ends ofshe classless sociery

“This is where she srudens movemens and she nonviolens movemens
shas is saking place in our nasion would break wish communism and any
osher sysscm shas would argue shas shc end iussifies she means. For in she
long run, we must see that the end represents the means in process and the
ideal in she making...rhe philosophy ofnonviolens resissanee is she philoso-
phy which says shas she means muss be as pure as die end, shas in she long
run ofhissory, immoral dessrucrive means cannos bring abous moral and
conssrucsive ends.”

When we reﬂect upon our efforts to protect our natural environment,
we should always keep in mind she end goals and she srakes. we muss never
forges shas she survival ofmany species, including our own, depends upon
our abilisy so find solusions so our environmensal problems. We muss also
seriously consider the means we adops in our search for solusions. One
similarisy shas she civil righss‘rnovemens and environmensal movemens share
is an effors to change she way sociery shinks and acss so benefis all iss mem.
bers. such movemenss consradics shemselves when shey physically assack
individuals wishin that socicsy.

To she Editor ofshe 3 Be B,

1 grew up in she 60’: and 70's, and nonviolenr prosess is pars
ofmy matrix I spens a lor ofsime on she ssreess ofWashingson;
1 marched wish Dr. King. Since coming so Grinnell, 1 have of»
sen sued shas our ssudcnss haven’s had a ssronger moral come
pass, haven's confronsed _ through cnlighsened discussion and
peaceful demonssrarion . issues of war, peace, racism and she
environmens. These acsivisies, 1 believe, are honorable and 1 re-
serve she righs so do shem again. some day I may chain myself
so a sree wish some of you, or picker wish you, or boyeosr a
producs, or allow myself so be arresred in an acs of civil (but
nonviolenr) disobedience.

Bus whas l wisncssed during IassThuisday's convocasion ins
vokcs in me neirher pride nor rcspccs, only shame. A few choice
adiecsives come so mind. Wirlcss. cowardly. Puerile. Violens.

is was wislcss because each of us on shis campus (including
our guesss) has she inalienable righs so express an opinion , even
an uncomforsable one - in an open and respecsful forum and so
defend is using she sools ofreasoning and rhesoric shas Grinnell
reaches. A pie in she face ofonc's opponens is just she oppo'sire.
It is aphasic, as dumb and as devoid ofshoughs as a belch,

is was cowardly because she pcrpcsrasors hid behind masks.
They hadn't rhe poise - in shis moss aceepsing and non-threats
