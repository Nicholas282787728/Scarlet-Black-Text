Intramural Board

Allows Gates Protest \

Gates‘ protest of its defeat by Clark
last week in the intramural speed.
ball tournament was upheld by the

who had reiuscd an invitation to
join the varsity iootball squad and
was therefore ineligible to compete.
By virtue ol the board's action, the
game, which Clark won by a 10.4
score, will be credited to Gates.

Members of the intramural board
are: Lester Duke, intramural director;
Randolph Carlson, Smith hall repre—
sentative; Frank MeWethyt Langan;
Berger Graves, Rawson; Charles Bow-
er, Gates; Kent Duncan, Clark; and
Sol Jacobson, Dibble.

When asked the Chinese attitude
toward communism, Galt declared that
they have little inclination toward ii,
since it has little to offer besides the
redistribution of land, The Chinese
are too lndividualistieally minded and
too little inclined to cooperate to
permit the establislunent of a com—
munistic state, he declared, It is
true that some of the students, a very
small minority, actively agitate cum»

The prevalence of bandltry in china
is due to the bad conditions of the
farmers, Gait said when questioned

e ileod and the iollowing year lose
another crop because of the drought.
Added to these misfortunes is the
distress caused by heavy taxation.
Many times the taxes are actually
collected years in advance, Gait said.
The farmer also suiiers from the
levies oi the various generals who
force the tanner to help support the
armies. In sheer desperation the far»
mers turn to banditry as a means of
gaining a livlihood.

When asked about the Chinese l’eel-
ing towards Japan, Gait replied that
there was an intense hatred oi Japan
shared by all Chinese people. There
is no paeiiicism in China. The only
reason China appealed to the league
of Nations was due to her lack oi
iunds and military supplies with
which to carry on a war with Japan.

The Chinese boycott of Japanese
goods was eniorced almost 100 per
cent, but now has become less effec—
tive due to China’s dependency upon
Japan for cheap household articles,
he explained.

The future oi China does not seem
so bright at the present moment, but
the students are striving loyally to
create a united nation. They are

 

especially interested in relieving China
ol the oppressive treaties forced upon
her by western countries, Galt added,

Balkan Situation
Treated Sunday
in Seiver’s Talk

Speaking on the corrupt political
situations in the Balkans, and in
Roumania in particular, George 0.
Seiver, assistant professor of French,
addressed an audience of about35 per.
sons at the latest meeting of the
Sunday Evening club. “Balkan
Blues,” was the topic of his talk.

Mr. Seiver lived in Roumania until
the time oi the World War and is
well acquainted with conditions in
that country. He described the
Roumanlan government as terribly
corrupt. The peasant class, he said.
is greatly supressed and the poor-er
people are very irequcntly thrown in.
to jail for acts oi very minor importa
ance.

The land is held by a compare»
tively small class of prosperous aristo.
crats, he revealed, and the peasants
who work the iields are rorced to
labor ior very meager wages.

Joseph Cunard, president of the
Sunday Evening Club, expressed dis-
satisfaction with the very small
number or students attending the
meetings. More should avail them.
selves of the opportunity to attend
them. he declared, since the talks are
consistently entertaining and educa—
tional.
