Letters To The Editor

 

To the Grinnell College community,

I didn’t know carl Grimm, but the news
ofhis suicide touched me personally in my
, three years at Grinncll College, I’ve had as
many hours with severe unipolar depression,
two ofwhich have landed me in the hospi-
tal. Sadly, I know many other students here
with similar histories. Despite the rhetoric
that drugs such as Prozac and lithium are
overprescribed, especiallyin Gtinncll, mood
disorders are very real and potentially devas-
tating to those ofus who suffer from rhem,
and I don't think I’m going out on too much
of a limb in saying that Grinncll students
may be particularly susceptible. Many men—
tal disorders first emerge in late adolescence/
early adulthood, and the academic demands
ofcollcge life are such that we often put our
mental and emotional needs on the
backburner until they can no longer be ig»
noted, at which poinr they may seem rhors
oughly overwhelming. One of the hardest
things about depression is the isolating cf»
feet it can have on its victims. it’s hard
enough sometimes to ask for help when you
feel like your siruario‘n’s hopeless and inevi—
table, even harder when you've lost every
shred ofselfworrh and already feel like you’re
being an enormous burden to those around
you. There’s often the feat (irrational though
it may be) that your friends will reject you,
or that a mental health professional will give
you a doomed diagnosis. Even ifyou bring
yourself to seek therapy, you have to fight
offrhe feeling that the only reason someones

listening to you whine and offering advice is
because they're being paid to do it.

I think its wonderrul that Griilncll Col-
lege offers students five free visits to the local
mental health center per semester. There are
some truly wonderful therapisrs and psychiar
trists at Poweshiek County MHC and I’m
not sure I‘d be here were it not for their assiSr
rance. I think, however, that more can be
done. Thcrc's been talk since l got here of
starting up group therapy sessions and de-
prcssion support groups; two weeks ago I was
told that such a program was almost launched
bur didn’t go rhtough because ofpeople's con—
flicting schedules. I would love to see groups
like this form; we already have a bereavement
support group, surely it can’t be that hard to
get similar programs going, I think it would
go a long way in terms ofhelping depressed
students break out of their isolation if they
felr as though their problems were not unique
and could feel as though they were helping
others heal as they themselves did. Please, if
you or anyone you know suffers from a mood
disorder, contact the Grinncll student Health
center and/or the Powcshick County Men-
tal Health Center and let them know that
youd like to see community support groups
offered. I don't know whether this would have
helped Carl, but I do know that he didn’t
wanr to die. Nobody does. All a suicidal pcr»
son wants is an end to the worst pain imag»
inabie, and the more alternatives one has
available to them, the better.

To the Editor,

The recent sad news from Grinnell has
prompted me to write. For quire some time I
have been concerned by the fact that crinnell
college has no real mental health service. Ac-
cessible support is offered ably by the Aca-
demic Advising Department, led by the err.
traordinary Jo calhoun. I can't imagine a
more sensitive, responsive service. And int
deed, five free visits are made availablc to stu»
dents at the Gtinnell Mental Health Center
(MHC). but this is not adequate. Despite the
best efforts ofrhe College advising commu-
nity, these visits are rarely used when they are
truly needed. it is difficult to get an appoint-
mentattheMHc.ortenastudentmustwait
a number ofweeks for an initial visit. In ad—
dition, these therapists are not focused on the
specific needs ofcollege students. I recently
spoke with the director of the Counseling
Center at Tufts University, who expressed his
surprise that Grinncll did not have at least
one fulletimc therapist for students, faculty,

and start While the RLCs [Rcsidcncc Lifc Cur
ordinatorsi at Grinncll are helpful in academic
counseling, few students use them for them
tal health counseling—and indeed they are
not qualiﬁed as licensed psychologists. ;

The tragedy thathappcncd could not have
been prevented by anyone on campus. Cert
tainly no one can be held responsible, but per
haps this incident could help us see that there
is a real need in our community. A need for
at least one full-time qualified individual who
can provide this important care forstudents.
it is not enough to provide shot—term coun-
seling sessions after this single event: the ad-
ministration must work to crcatc a constant
resource for the Campus,

I can't think ofa better use for a small
portion of Gtinncll's substantial growth in
assets than to provide this care. in the long
run this would be a small investment in en:
suring that students make the most of
Gtinncll’s educational opporruniries.

To the Editor,

Thanks to the 5&5 and Hung Pham for
the Sept. 11 update on the Buckshautn Cen—
ter for the Arts. A truly world class piccc of
architecture, the Ccntcr will be a Signifimnt
addition to the campus and our already thrive
ing arts programs. I am writing simply to
clarify somc issucs regarding the progrcss of
the projcct.

To note that the ”Fine Arts addition (is)
dclaycd furtherﬂ‘ and that it was originally
“scheduled to open last year” is incorrect. The
goal for (11: overall completion ofthc build-
ing has bccn, from thc bcginning, Dcccm-
bcr/January, 1998/99, A5 of this dart, that
dcadlinc rcmains thc rcalizablc goalr Thcrc
may have bccn some misundcrstanding rc-
garding intcrim dcadlincs, rcfcrrcd to as in-
terim milcstoncs, for completion of parts of
ihc building. In general, such interim milc-
stones floar according to a wriery ofcondi.
tions, including weather, coordination prob
lems, labor action, and, yes, work that must
be tc-done due to unsatisfactory quality. Thus,
although the Theatre atcas wcrc substantially
complctc last January as planned, and occu-
picd for the spring scmestcr, the ncw Music
and Art areas were dclaycd until thc begin»
ning of the current semester. Keep in mind
that, although these new areas wctc not avail-
ablc last scmcster, the dclay kcpt the cxlsting
Finc Arts wing in operation. The inconvc.
nience involved with using temporary spaces,
cspccially with regard to practicc rooms, was
signiﬁcantly reduced by out having [0 use
those temporary spaces for only four months
rather than a full ycat.

The schcdulc has always called for comple-
tion of the new sections first-and the rcnova-
tion last. In fact, we havc accclcratcd parts of
Kim renovation ahead ofscltcdulc, c.g., Robe
crrsThcarrc and rhe public restroom area. it's

 

important to note drat ALI, ofthe Music prac»
tice rooms will be located in the renovated
Finc Arts building. Again, rhar has always
been the case. Arrangements were made for
temporary practice rooms in the new build
ing, utilizing storerooms, green rooms, and
other spacc wc could free up. Thesc rooms
wcrc not designed for such use and wc’vc had
to make adjustments as the semester got un»
dct way to accommodate the special needs of
the Music department.

To the notion that thc project is taking
too long, lct mt notc that two and onc-half
years for a structure as largc and complex as
the Bucksbaum Center is actually fat from
generous. it rook over two years just to get it
all on paper, and that wasjust thc initial draw-
inglee’rc looking at approx. 120,000square
feet of space constituting a very complex
structure with few right angled corners, nu-
merous curvcd surfaces, large quantities of
specializcd equipment, materials, and pro-
cesses. I imagine most ofus would prefer that
the necessary time is taken to assutc thc high
quality we all expect ofa world class build»
ing.

it would be dangerous and foolish to guar-
antee anydring regarding a construction pro-
cess. However, at this point, I am confident
that we will be “substantially complctcff by
the first ofthc year and all areas ofthc build-
ing will be occupied for second semester.
Detail work and punch list irenrs will con.
tinue throughout second scmcstcr. By spring,
we will all have the opportunity to revel in
and appreciate a magnificent building of
which all Grinnellians can be extrcmcly
proud.

in staging the protest, the students in Dce
reuse of Animals and the Errvrronmenr ar
Grinncll decided rhar a civil disobedience ac
tion would get their point across. By locking five
people to a structure containing old growth lum-
berar Home Depotwith rr.rhaped bicycle locks,
and risking arrest, the ctmnellians hoped that
Home Depot would get the message, and stop
buying old growth wood. other protesters would
stand outside ofrlre store with signs and leaflets
to inform the public about the devastating cf-
fecrs ofharvesring old growth wood, and hand
out postcards addressed ro rhc corporate heads
ofHome Depot asking them to stop their scll-
irrg ofold growth wood.

In the beginning, everything went accord
ing to plan for the twenty-some protesters from

were locked down successfully in Home Depot

As the outside protesters moved into posi<
tron, a Des Moines police car pulled up, and
asked the demonstrators to leave the premises,
thrcarening to arrest everyone for trespassing on
private property, As the students reluctantly
moved away from rhe building, they were told
that die parking ior area was also private prop-
erty, and that they had to stand out by Univer-
sity Avenue, the nearest road to the entrance of
Home Depot. This actually turned out to be a
good position, because ofrush hour traffic.

media coverage was more than adequate, as a

positive and negative, as some took the infors
