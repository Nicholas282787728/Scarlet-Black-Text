~ This past Tuesday, an elderly woman was found dead on
her ﬂoor between her home’s kitchen and living room in Des
Moines. JoArin Knuson, 72, was found facedown after falls
ing Friday. Knutson's husband, Richard Toews, 52, said that he
tried to lift Knutson and proceeded to give her food and water
as she remained on the ﬂoor. The police believe that Knut-
son remained on the ﬂoor ailing because she refused to call
an ambulance due to costs. Captain Steve Brown of the Des
Moines Fire department reported that an ambulance costs ap
proximately 5575 and that individuals who cannot pay have
the option ofsetting up a payment plan or utilizing Medicare's
services. Knutson’s daughter, Nicole Knutson was in disbelief
after hearing the story of her mother‘s slow decline. An au—
topsy revealed no signs ofviolence. Toews declined to corn:

' - Merriam Webster’s 10th edition dictionary has been re—
moved from classrooms in Menifee Unionschool district after
a parent discovered a child reading the deﬁnition of‘bIal sex."
The dictionary, used for the past few years in classrooms in
the southern Californian school district, has now disappeared
from shelves due to fears from parents, who have stated that
the entry is "just not age appropriate." Some parents, such as
Randy Freeman, believe that banning the dictionary is a smart
move, because “there are words in there of concern,” while
others say that having access to these educational resources are
beneﬁcial. Other books that have been recently challenged in
the US are Toni Morrison’s Song ofSolomon, as well as books
by Khaled Hosseini and Phillip Pullman.

A newer, sleeker Homepage revealed

BY MATTHEW BACHTcLL

Returning from Winter Break, many students noticed the
radical difference in Grinnell’s website, as part ofa twophase
plan to make the site more accessible to the students and fac-
“19’-

“What people are seeing now is the
culmination of phase one of two of the
web project, which was mostly to get it
into a new content management system,
said Mark Root Wiley 08, who was hired
to assist with the project.

Drupal, the new system, is a popular
open source content management system
that breaks down page content into usable
data, so information can be berrer organ
nieed. it is the second such system utilized by the college

“WhenI started working here, which was 10 years ago, we
just had a whole bunch of pages. They were not maintained
centrally at all, so the site was a huge mess, ”said Online Media
and Web Coordinator Leonid Ilrdnov,

Ivanov, in an attempt to centralize and organize the infor-
mation on the site, looked into outside content management
systems. The previous system, BOInFree, was installed, but
quickly became unwieldy

“It was a good step, but because I’m the only developer...
by the um: we were done, people wanted so much more that in
the end [just switched completely into support mode. . .putting
out free instead of making something new," Ivnrtov said.

A closercampus group of students, faculty
and staﬁ" met to discuss problems with the qual-
ity of the website, as well as trim the content of
the website. Palantir, a Chicagorbased firm, was
hired to install Drupal, and to transfer onto it the
site’s content.

The launch of the new website marks the
completion of phase one, which was to install the
underlying system. Over the next few months, ,
students and faculty are invited ro give feedback,
through the group’s Wiki on the College's web-
site or by emailing [webguys], and actively participate in the
completion of phase two.

“We’re hoping thar sometime in the next one to three years
we‘ll be able to hire a professional firm to redesign the entire
site, restructure the entire site and really make the site better
from a usability perspective, so it won’t just look different,"
Root-Wiley said. "It’ll actually work different.That’ll be phase
two."
