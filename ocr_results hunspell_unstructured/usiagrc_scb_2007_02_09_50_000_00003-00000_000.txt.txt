meeting with faculty to get a sense of the school. Since then,
his determination to work with students and faculty as well as
prospective students, has been one of his trademarks. “He's in

Is enough construction
ever really enough?

Even with the Campus Center complete, construction continues on campus

BY CHLOE Mom

Even as they walk into the newly completed campus center,
students need only look across the street to know that con»
strrrctron at Grinneu rs far from ovcr. Noyce science center,
along with several other projects, point to a future of further
construction in the next few years.

These developments leave many students and alumni with
memories of a campus
filled with woikers,
cranes and excavators.
Administrators prom—
ise that this will be the
last phase of building
for a long time, but this
brings little reassurance
to current students.

Noyce has been
under construction for
over two yeais, and
administrators have set its finish for Janunry of2008, “Noyce
is the culmination ofa twenty-year-long process of planning,
working, fundraisrng, and building to have a uniﬁed and comr
modiotis science center with lots of student study space in a
new science facility," said Grinnell College President Russell
K. Osgood.

Parts of the Biology and Chemistry department will be
moving in to the new section ofNoyce over spring break This
new section will offer a variety of improvements to the old
space. According to Jim Swartz, Dean ofthe College,these 2|th
dition will include “a much larger science library, much better
lab facili s, particularly large changes to biology and psycholr
ogy labs, and then labs for computer science, more classrooms
and faculty ofﬁces"

Administrators hope these construction projects will also
improve interactions among ﬁrculty and students. “There will
be mole tables and chairs for students to study and build com-
munity,” Swaitz said. “We’re ti ying to support an inquiryrhascd
learning so students and faculty are engaged in doing science."

The administration also wanted to offei new ways for stun
dents to interact in dorms. The Cowles residence hall, which
has been under construction since last year, is schcdrrled to open
Fall 2007 as pseudOrtown houses.

“We wanted to provide Grinnell studctits with housing that
was different. Cowles will have about 47 spaces, and for the
rooms, some are three and some ale four or five to a suite,"said
Torn Cindy, Vice President of Student Affairs. “Each apartr
ment has bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, a dining area and
a living area."

Some are not as pleased, because of the number of doubles
in these townhouses. According to Tom Crady, Vice-President
for Student Affiats, there are “a signiﬁcant number" of dou-

she could properly budget her
time to allow for the job of
being a senator.

Even so, Polivy has not
been able to perfectly balance
her commitments. She has
“become less active" in some
of these other programs, and
was unable to help teach belly
dancing this semester b3,

Bur new senators are not
overly concerned about the
commitment. Chris Hadc
'09, a new senator this scmes»
ter, has tried to plan ahead
to allow for scrA responsir
bilities and intends to “make
SGA a priority” in his life. Jae
cob Reisberg'io,another new
senator, is even more at ease
with his role on Joint Board
and committees. “I’ll have to
stop watching Lori but [that's

it]," he said.

In addition, SGA Presir
dent Chris Hall also sees the
time commitmentas manager
able. “It’s just [a matter of]
striking a balance between
feeling pleased with produc-
tivity and
trying to
maintain a
good state
of mind,"
he said.

spite these
experienc-
es, SGA
has had

“it’s the most honest and

According to Blencowe,
this tactic has not been as
successful as he hopes it could

an increase in candidates this
semester, He attributed this
success to more effective mm.

These apartments are like East Campus dorms in that lots
of windows will allow for increased natural light. “Each apartr
merit should be light, open, and airy. We’re really excited about
what it'll look like when it’s complete," said Crady. “And it
shouldn’t cost mole than anywhere else on campus.” Butwhile
Noyce and Cowles are almost complete, one project is still in
the planning stages.

The continuation ofthe athletic center does not yet have an
estimated completion date. The center will eventually include a
SOrmctcr pool and diving well, and also a new field house with
an indoor track and tennis courts.

“The pool is aimed at providing great swimming space
both for our team and the high school team and the rest of the
Glinnell community,” Osgood said. “We think rt will help the
students and stafflead healthy lives."

This project, however, will help not only members of the
college,hut also community members. According to men’s and
women's Head swim Coach Erin Hurley, Grinnell has the only
competition-regulated pool in town, “We service not only the
college but also the high school, the Tiger Shark program, and
community swimming," said Hurley,

The new pool will
accommodate all of
Gtinnell’s aquatic ac
tivity. “With the new
pool, we’ll have twice
as many lanes, we’ll be
able to hold diving and
swimming at the same
time, we’ll have regu»
lation water polo, and
there will be enough
space for the kayaking
classes to get some n,
ally ﬂuid kayaking," said Hurley, "It will be one of, if not the
best, Division Three pool for a school our size in the country.”

Despite the toll that such projects take on the college come
munity, Osgood believes that as the construction decreases,
students will find these facilities worth the cost. “The trustees
agree with the students that we need to go into a period of
calming things down,"said Osgood. ”And now we have all this
new space, so use it, go and sec wharworks, what doesn’t work,
etc.”

Associate Dean Marci Sortor agreed, “We're coming to the
end of this building boom. If you look back in Grinnell's his-
tory, there have been times where the face of the campus has
changed in really important ways, and we’re coming to the end
of that phase."

”There will be more tables and
chairs farstudents to study and
build community.”

Ethanol

time wr hour a history ofsafety problems."
f mm P- 7 Neither of the two other plants owned
by Big River Resources, one in Galvin and one in West Bur-
lington, have had safety problems. Dcffenbaugh said it was as
dangerous as holding ”a cigarette in one hand and a hard liquor
drink in the other."

According to Union Paciﬁc ofﬁcials, the plant, in addition
to being safe, will also be ecologically sound.The ethanol pro
duced at the 100rmillionrgallon plant will burn clean and pure,
making it environmentally friendly,

Union Paciﬁc and other ofﬁcials also see the plant as nn
economic boon to the city.

“it's generating real wealth for this rural community," said
Belrrerrs. The plant will provide approximately 50 jobs for
Grinnell citizens.

The operations of the plant are almost entirely 1ocal,which
means much orthe ﬁnancial gains will remain in the commu-
nity. “When you ship corn outside the community, the value
leaves the community,"sdid Deffcnbaugh.

Though the plant is orrtside Grinnell city limits, and thus
outside the city's tax base, it may later be incorporated by the
town to fully beneﬁt from it,

Currently, Grinnell is providing the plant with utilities and
a 20-year tax abatement in return fora rec thatwas paid to the
cr .
ryLocals hope the plant will spark the economy, and not an
explosion.
