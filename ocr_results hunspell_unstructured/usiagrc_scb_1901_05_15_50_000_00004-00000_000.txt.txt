The grnnd drama in the history or

selected its to present with great toros
the elements of striking drornstic situar

The musical dress in which sit is
clothsd is rich and the movement stator
ly and grand. It would trnnscsnd our
space to deal with all thesaiient lssturss
ot the work.

The largest snsrs oitne notion and
musical movsmsnt is ihut ot the prophet,
und the magniﬁcent bass score in which
it nccurs wus sung by Mr. Duﬂ't whose
rioh, isrgs sud powsrtul voice is emi.
nently adapted to tbs port. The part or
the Obndtsh, the praphat’s servant, in
written in the tenor and was sung by
Mr. crowns with good siisct. The
soprano and contralto scores snnounos
angelic visits mainly sud they give the
sadness and joy or the mother ct the
youth who is restored to his by the
prophet.

The choruses were well sung, und al.
though rroni smstsurs such good wortr
might not be expected, were remarkably
free from blemish. The long training
by so enlightened o leaasr as Mr. Cole
was rownrdsd by scapncity ta partici-

of tbs college and the city which will,
we trust, be epochnl.

Mr cblcns aconduotor showed all tbs

conﬁdence, not only of the srnritsurs who

musical contingency in which he would
not be master ot the situation.
