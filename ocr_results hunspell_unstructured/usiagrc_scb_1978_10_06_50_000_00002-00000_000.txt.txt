SGA fails to act on alcohol

Joint Board‘s chance to for-
mulate an alcohol policy was
nearly thwarted at last Wed-
nesday's meeting because a
quorum was not present for the
deciding vote.

However, the son has'learned
that the Committee on Student Life
voted at its meeting late last night
“to give Joint Board another week
to respond," according to SGA
President Greg Youtz.

Alter the Joint Board meeting
Youtz had commented,

“i think it’s really unfortunate that
because of the parliamentary
move by some of the represenr
tatives the Joint Board will have no
official position on the policy. It
destroyed a chance for the Joint
Board to express itself on behalf of
the students." CSL’S decision now
gives SGA a reprieve.

THE ALCOHOL 1701le
discussion seemed plagued with
problems from the beginning when
the hall representatives from
Clark, Gates and Rawson left
early, which made attendance
dangerously close to no quorum. At
one point several reps walked out
brlelly as a protest to David
Herren’s amendment. which would
allow SGArlunded alcohol at
parties in an enclosed portion of
Darby Gym, They decided to
return before any vote was called
Unrepresented dorms for the
entire evening were Cowles,
Langan and Read.

The conﬂict came to a head when
Smith hall rep Seth Powers left the
assembly moments before the final
vote on an amendment to the CSL
proposal, Cleveland hall rep
George Turnbull then asked for a
roll call vote, which requires the
presence of 16 members, but
, without Powers there was no
majority so the vote was rendered
useless. Powers quietly watched
the proceedings from the door of
ARH ll.

THE MEETING ended abruptly
with tempers ﬂaring at the actions
of both Powers and Turnbull. Some
of the committee members felt it
would have been better to just use
a voice vote, which does not
require a quorum in order to be

 

legitimate.

James rep Danny Kadden ac-
cused Turnbull of conduct which
was “a purposeful act to put down
the student voice. I consider his act
irresponsible because he gave up
the Joint Board's opportunity to
have a voice."

TURNBULL. HOWEVER. stood
by his decision. His reasons for
requesting the roll call were
twofold. He states, ”on an issue
that has as much meaning as this
one, all reps should be on the
record. Yes, l did suspect that we
didn't have a quorum. That was all
the more reason to have the
required amount of voters present
so it would be a true representation
of the students. But,” he stresses,
“there was no conspiracy behind
my action,”

In a statement made later in the
evening Powers admits, “I made
a mistake and I apologize to both
Joint Board and the students for
not letting the Joint Board have
their policy, whatever it was, go
before President Turner for

Alumni take refresher course

 

Considera tion along with the policy
proposed by CSL. I stand
corrected," '

DESPITE arguments by several
people attending the meeting that
lhe Herren amendment would be
discriminatory against 400
students next year, a majority or
the assembly apparently backed .
the proposal. Several represenr
latives pointed out that at functions
held in Darby those students under
age had other forms of en.
tertainment, mainly dancing,
available to them on the premises

Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman pointed out that the
college lawyer felt that this sort of
arrangement would still cause
problems because alcohol brought
in by individuals would be hard to
distinguish from that served within
the enclosure in case of a law suit.
Members quickly pointed out that
this was a very small risk because
minors have been known to receive .
alcohol in this same manner no
matter how the law read in the
past.

Last weekend's Volunteer Leadership Conference brought over 100
alumni to Grinnell to discuss rund raising and volunteer respon—

Court rulings threaten newsrooms

IN REGARD TO the 85:3,
Deminoff feels that these issues
don‘t have the same intensity. He
also does not see any cirr
cumstances under which this type
of occurrence may happen.
However, Deminoff does feel that
regardless, all institutions are “in
the same boat.” Also. many states
have passed legislation which
limits the use of warrants in press
Searches, Such legislation is now
pending in Congress,

Besides general problems of
practical consideration for an
editor. Deminoff believes that
other aspects of the recent rulings
are important. Timely publication

as a result of all material being
interrupted. As a result of the
decisions, reporters must now be
very careful about their notes and

than subpoenas in 14 cases. Before
the Stanford case, no search
warrants had ever been issued
against papers. The major dif-
ference between the two is that a
subpoena allows the subpoenaed
group to come before a judge and
argue their case, A search
warrant, on the uther hand, takes
effect immediately and eliminates
the time factor and any possible
counter 'action. Syndicated
columnist Charles B. Seib points
out that increases in Search
warrants for the press have imr
plications for freedom of the
public. “A threat to one is a threat
to the other. and one cannot sur-
vive without the other," he said.

DEMINOFF BELIEVES that
”an assault is being made upon the
first amendment and the con-
stitutional rightof the press to seek
out and disclose information in the

public interest." He also thinks
that “this is shaping up into a
really major confrontation bet
ween me press and the Supreme
Court."

Specifically in reference to the 0
Stanford case but in relation to
press rights and freedoms. the
American Civil Liberties Union
commented. “If the offices and
houses of innocent people can be
searched without notice just
because the police say they might
contain papers relevant to a
criminal investigation. there is not
a newspaper. . ,or a private home
that can any longer claim the
protection of the Fourth Amend-
ment. No file, desk drawer. or attic
is insulated from surprise police
scrutiny. Congress must act
quickly to save the right of privacy
from this devastating blow by the 0
Supreme Court."
