Pioneers’
record

falls during
Break

By Michael Patterson

After big conference victories
against Knox and Illinois College,
the Grinnell Pioneers men’s base
ketbitll team began break with a 5.
5 record and high spirits. The team
had a disappointing start to the new
year, however, losing three con-
secutive conference games after
pummeling pitiful I-Iaverford. The
Pioneers did not play particularly
wellagainstl-laverford,butsti|lwon
by 30, 105-75. Senior guard Hole
landNeachdtheway wtth24 points
anti 6 rebounds. Freshmen Craig
Studerztnd Dave Mussattaddcd 18
and 16 points respectively.

The second game of 1991 had
the Pioneers traveling to Cedar
Rapids to meet their archrivats, the
CoeKohawks. Grinnellplayed one
of their best games of the season,
butended up losing 119407. Jun~
ior center Chris Jacobson turned in
an heroic performance, scoring 29
points, grabbing 12 rebounds, and
blocking 5 shots Mussattadded 23
points, and the team displayed a
“never say die” attitude despite the
fonnidablecompetition. In theend,
though, the Kohawks were too
strong. Coegotsolid performances

respectively. Evenmoreimpressive
was the effort turned in by Coe’s
hard-working Mark Kleppe who
pulled down 21 boards and scored
17 points.

I think sofizr this season we
have taken three steps for-
ward. This last week, we took
one step back,

Next, the Pioneers headed nonh-
east to take on Ripon and Lake
Forest It is a trip they wish to
forget. The offense was out of
synch in both games, and the Pie»
neer defense was sub-par, giving
up too many easy baskets. Ripon
beat the Pioneers easily, 98778.
while the Foresters prevailed by a
103-85 count One brightspot was
Mussau, who scored 23 against
Ripont

Coach David Arseneault ex-
pressed his dimppointment in last
week's game. "I think that so far
this season we have taken three
steps forward. This last week, we
took one step back," said
Arseneault. He stressed that, with
hard work, the team will get back
on the right track.

A 272 record in four games since

women‘s basketball team looking
to make some adjustments to their
first semester game plan.

Shannon Hancock contributed

Eskildsen admits that his team
is struggling both offensively and
defensively. “offensively, people
are beginning to adjust to what we
were doing well ﬁrst semester,”
Eskildsen said. Quicker defense is
taking away the initial scoring op»
