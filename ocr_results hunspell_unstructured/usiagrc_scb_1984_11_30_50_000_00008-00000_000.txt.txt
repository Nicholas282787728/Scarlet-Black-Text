Joseph Wall replied. "The sad
thing is that it's not really been in

What‘s going on in Nicaragua to-
day is precisely what's happened
time and time again in the past
sixty years. We've done more to
create communist opposition
throughout capitalistic interests
than Russia has eversheen able to
do. Time and time again. a leader

into the clutches ot the Soviet
Union when what they really want
to be is theinselves.’

Speaking ol the Soviet Union.
Herz remarked that her inipi-cs-
sion was that the Soviet Union has
been "largely discredited" in Cen-
trl Americ' Even cuba and
i\' aragua, who plainly have
strong ties to the soviet Union. do
not hold that nation in \ei'y high
csteem. she said.

The conversation then turncd to
possible solutions to the problems
in Central America All three cit»
dorsed the tontad as a group ol
nations including lticxicn.
Panama. and Venezuela, that has
served as a mediator and
negotiator among the parties in
the region. '“e have sort oi par»
ticipated titlully in the contadora
ettorts." said Jones. "lCum
ladoral represents a kind ot third
power. a neutral lorce in the area
that we haven‘t paid much atten»
tioii to,"

Asked whether something else
could have been done by the

United states to prevent the pre-
sent situation. Jones replied “I
don't know whethe» given our
historical traditions in the area.
\te Could have chosen a dttteictll
course under Democrats or
KGDUbliLdl’lS "

Wall added. "We were taking
the sanle course ttnterventinnl in
ltiexico in tutti when there hasn‘t
any Russian t-oiiiniunisiii,... it‘s
simply- very convenient tor our
own lleadersl to intake ltciitrnt

that liilictlicrl tiny adlitlltlsti'd'

Joncs ventured that Nicaragua
