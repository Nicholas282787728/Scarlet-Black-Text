Women’s water

olo falls at home

Low numbers and inexperience spell trouble fort e Black Sheep, who began their season last weekend

 

BY Mancus EAGAN

The Grinnell Women’s Water Polo
team hosted the “Heartland Crossover,"
the Heartland Conference’s annual tourna-
ment, to kick off the season last weekend at
the PRC. Despite posting a tea records
with two of those losses forfeitedithe
captains appear optimistic about the sea,
son.

"We are in the Heartland Division, or
basically the 'Midwest Division,’ and we
had all eight teams from the division here
[at Grinnell] this [last] weekend," Andrea
Leiser ’11 said.

The Heartland Division's eight teams
are Carleton College (Northfteld, Minn.),
Illinois State (Normal, Ill.), Lindenwood,
(St. Charles, Mo.), Iowa State Univer~
sity (Ames, Iowa), St Mary's (Winona,
Minn), Washington University (st. Louis,
Mo.) and Grinnell.

Leiser, one of the team's co-captains, is
pleased with the progress the team is mak-
ing But the team has one major obstacle:
the club team needs more players,

While several teams on campus, like
swimming, volleyball or cross-country,
have gigantic teams, as a club, the Water
Polo team has difficulty keeping numbers
up As a result, the Women's Water Polo
team is happy to have any player that they
can get.

 

 

"All of our teammates are valuable as-
sets to the team," Carolyn Wright ’11, the
team’s other co—captain and offensive hole
set, said. “They're necessary because this
year we have a small team...and we need

five seniors last year, and it is difﬁcult to
.say whether the drain in experience or

everyone."

This year's team is smaller than last
year‘s team and even smaller than expected
heading into this season. In fact, the team
barely has enough Black Sheep—the tearn’s
name~for a substitution.

“Our team has gotten downsized [dur-
ing the year] so we only have eight people,
and you need seven to compete," wright
said.

The Black Sheep, indeed, graduated

numbers was a bigger loss.

“This year is going to be hard because
lastyear we graduated five seniors, and four
were on our starting lineup," Leiser said.
“So that really puts us at a disadvantage
because a lot of people have to fill those
positions."

Another factor contributing to the
player shortage, though, is that no new
students, aside from Lindsay Schwartz ’13
have joined the team. Schwartz swims for

for the team.

“[Lindsey] is also the only left-handed
player on the team, and its kind of nice to
have one of those," Leiser said.

The Black sheep's small size could pre-
vent the team from being very competitive
this year. However, one beneﬁt of the lack
ofplayers, though, is that all of this year’s
players will get a lot ofin-game experience.

“Since we are smaller and we know we
are not going to win conference, we are

Leiser said. “Some of the girls on the team
hardly saw any playing time last year, but
this weekend they played whole games.
You can imagine how much that would
improve you as a player."

Wright encourages anyone who wants
to try the sport, or even “just to practice"
with the team, to come out.The team prac—

Baseball gets green for the first time this year

After poor end—of—year showing last season, Pioneers slated for four outdoor games to start the year

BY DARWIN MANNING
While pro athletes head down to Florida and Arizona to

begin their season, Grinnells baseball squad kicks things oft

in the snow-filled Midwest The Pioneers will face off against
Westminster College at 11: 00 a. in. tomorrow in Fulton, M0
for their first game and then play Central college later that
day at 2 pm, on Sunday, the Pioneers
will play a doubleheader versus the same
two opponents. Grinnell Baseball is
coming offa superb season that unfortu-
nately did not have the ending many of
the players were hoping for, after going
2244 but losing its last four games to
conference opponents, St. Norbert and
Monmouth.

“It was hard to ﬁnish such a success-
ful season with losses at the Conference
Championship,"Pitchcr Ryan Harris ’10
said. “I honestly feel that we were the
best team “'1 the conference and we will
be this year too,"

The Pioneers hope to redeem themselves this season by
successtuuy bringing home the Midwest Conference Chime
pionship.

"Our goal for this season is the conference champion-
ship,” Harris said. We got to the tournament last year, but
came home disappointed. Thats not going to happen this
year. This is our year

Last year, the team graduated several important seniors
including Gary Kahn 09, Ben Mendoza 09 and Brett Ma-

loney ’09, As a result the roster will be young With only two
juniors, and nine seniors out of 35 players.

“We lost a lot ofseniots, and that is somewhat ofa cons
cern, as well as Chad Takabllkl being our only returning cap~
tnin,” snid Head Coach Tun Hollibnugh.

But with a wealth of first years and second years, Hol-
libnugli hopes to find someone who can
step up to the plate, so to speak.

“The two key positions defensively
are going to bt first base where we have
a number of guys that could fill in and
shortstop where we are most likely going
to have a rirst year,”Hollibaugh soul.

The tour games this weekend will not
only be important to start on the right
foot, but will also be able to show Hol-
libnugli which players will be key contrib-
utors in game situations,

The Pioneers will face their ﬁrst axes
man this weekend against an opponent, as
well as their first experience playing our-
doors in several months.

“Unfortunately, with Grinncll's stupendous weather res
cord, we haven't been outside since the fall," Harris said.
“We’ll have to adjust to game conditions rather quickly, but I
know we are ready for it."

This will be something that the Pioneers will most likely
have to battle for much of the ﬁrst month of the season, as
Iowa's long and arduous winter matches on.

“I have a real concern in the weather," Hollibaugh said. “I

Tim Hollibau h

can tell this going to be a battle all year and a byproduct of
that is not being able to get outside,”

Despite the lack ofoutdoor action, the team feels well pre-
pared, as all second semester they have been practicing and
conditioning hard in order to prepare for what promises to be
both i physically and mentally demanding schedule.

"we are running harder, conditioning longer and proper
ing ourselves for n full season," Harris said, ”Last year we
might have had a dip in performance during the second half
ofthe season, That won’t happen this year."

concl i Holhbaugh also stressed that he has been trying to
change up the formnt of training this semester, by giving the
players a break from the constant grind ofregular drills.

“I have been trying to add an increased sense of compe-
tition amongst the team, through havmg them wrestle and
compete in other forms its well, Hollibaugh sn .

The Pioneers are also looking ahead to their trip to Flore
idn over spring Break where they will play some stiff come
petition.

“We really amped up our spring Break schedule, we’re
playing st. Olnf [college], [the University of] St. Thomas
and Calvin [College], which are all ranked and Went to the
regional inst year," Hollibaugh said.

St. Thomas, in particular, is a team that not only competed
in the regional last year, but is the defending champion and
this rnotchup, l—lollibnugh believes, will be a confidence boost
no matter the outcome,

“seeing good competition will give us a good idea of
where we are as a team and what we need to work on before
Conference," Harris said.
