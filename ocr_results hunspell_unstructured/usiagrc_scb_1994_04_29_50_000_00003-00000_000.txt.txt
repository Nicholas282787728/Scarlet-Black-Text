Student—founded, student—
directed ensembles premiere

HEN Sherecn Ali and
David Preston noticed
voids in Grinnell's per-

formanceprograms,tlieydidn‘icom—
plain—instead, they determined to
do something to fill them.

Theirdcterminationcreatcd two
new ensembles on campus, both nln

rentircly by students. The Body and
Soul dance troupe gives its firstshow
Sunday night at 8:00 in the Harris
Center, and the Grinnell Band will
. play on Barbchlltza in the late after-
. noon next Monday, May 9.

First-year student Ali said she
§oundett Body and Soul when she
found her own ambitions incompat-
ible with the coliege'sdancecun‘icu-
lum. “I wouldn’t say that this is to
supplement anything," she said, “I
have a different ideal."

Urging by others prompted se-
nior Preston to form the only official
GrinnellConccrt Band in35 years. “I
feltsomething was missingand a lot
of people said, ‘I wish there was a
band to play in,”’ Preston said.

Body and Salli’s premier con-

>cert is a performance of works in
progress, featuring choreography by
some ofits 18 members. Ali stressed
that the choreographers are not sub-
jected to any form of censorship,
facilitating unconventional creativ-
ity. “Each choreographer did some—
thing thatenibodies lheirbeliefs,who
they are,” Ali said.

The Concert Band‘s perforr
mance will have“a community band

. feel," according to Preston. “It‘s
good music, it will be fun and it will
be outside." he added. Attendance at
band rehearsals has varied between

v 15 and 35, and Preston welcomes
anyone who would like to attend re-
hearsals next week and perform in

' the May 9 concert. For more infor-

Preston credited band members‘
enthusiasm for reaching his expecta-
tions. “It worked out exactly like
whatI wanted," he said. “I lrytokecp

ing the band, ”Something to look

Ali wants tocontinue withBody

years here, she said. People have
already expressed interest about the
troupe for next year, according to
Ali,andshehopesthatthetroupewill

Voenman’s retirement meaning a

pending on what happens with the
dance troupe nextyear, maybe some-
thing entirely different will happen,"
Ali Said.

Preston, who graduates in May,
said he would like the band to remain

The band’s goal, said Preston, is
simple: “Play the music."

Letters from the Old World

Part XI—Eastem Trains and Venice
By Riva Sharples, Foreign Correspondent

 

 

barriers, nothing beats the tiains in Eastern Europe, where schedules are not followed, Westerners
(especially Americans) are not wellrliked and train travel can be a downright scary experience.

I experienced several harrowing, heart-pumping adventures while traveling in Eastern Europe, all ofwhich
occurred while I was travelingalone. The first indication ofharshness on Eastern IIainsoccurredonan ovemight
journey from Budapest to Prague. 1 had just found an empty compartment, stretched out and was drifting off
to sleep, lulled by the rhythmic lurching, when suddenly I was awakened by the abnipt stopping and squealing
or the train. We were at the border control point between Hungary and Slavakia. Three border check ofﬁcials
came to my compartment, glanced at the USA emblem on my passport, grumbled something to one anoiherand
then left, lcurlcd back up. but could not fall asleep because we seemed to be Sitting there for so long. I thought
that maybe something was wrong with the train, so I peeked cautiously out of the compartment.

The train aisle wa' rowded with people and others were opening Ihetrcompartment doors and coming out
to join the crowd, yawning and rubbing their eyes. A few doors down. a couple from Canada was obviously
having troubles. The woman was yelling, “I don’t care what you do. I am not getting off this train until I get
to Prague in the morning." Apparently, the couple did not have a visa to travel through Slavakia and, because
they were Canadian, they needed one. The train sat there for an hour whtle border ofﬁcials argued with the
woman, and the police ﬁnally came. Four strong men, clad in stiff uniforms and speaking harshly and quickly,
came onto the train and halfadragged, half-carried the woman onto the platform. She was yelling and fighting
them. As soon as they setherdown, she started swinging herpurse at them,spewingouteverycursewordknown
to lnan. Her husband seemed to be more calm. “Eleanor," he kept saying. “We can’t fight them. Let’s just
go peacefully. They are going to charge us forevery minute we hold up the train." She was yelling, “But there
are no trains back to Budapesttonight! Whatdo they expect us [0d07 Spend thenightin themiddleofnowhere. "

It did seem like the middle of nowhere. The station was a simple one, withjust two tracks and no indoor
waiting room, and there were very few lights to be seen in the surrounding countryside. The couple was
handcuffed and escorted off the platform and we were eventually on our way again. I heard several other
Americans who were also watching the performance say, “Thank God were American!" as we pulled out of
the station. None ofus had seen anything like that happen before. In Western Europe, ifa person does not have
a visa for a country, they were almost always issued one on the spot by the border control ofﬁcials.

I was on another overnight train, one bound for Warsaw from Prague, when I learned of the “train gangs,"
another interesting feature of Eastern train travel. It was around 3:00 am. when the conductor came to check
my ticket. He punched the ticket. then looked at me and at my stuff stored in the bins overhead. Saying
something in rapid Polish, he pointed to the bins. I didn‘iknow what he was saying, so Ijust smilw. He left.
I closed the door to my compartment and promptly went back to sleep. I suddenly awoke when I heard a slight
rustling above me. I opened my eyes to find three men in my compartment going through my bags. Isat bolt
uprightand tried to scream, but I was too scared and shocked to let out any sound. They said something and
left quickly, mnning down the train aisle. [slept with my stuffattached to me for the rest of the night. When
I got to Warsaw, I was told that the country has a major problem with train gangs: men who make their living
by jumping trains and stealing. These gangs are apparently almost like the Maﬁa. in that they have power in
the train administration and are gaining strength in Polish society.

One ofmy favorite destinations was Venice, Iraly,the famouscity ofwaterwaysand canals, where we spent
twoand a halfdays. When wearrived, itseemedas though wecouldbe in any century. Aside from memotorized
boats and obviously 20thrcentury clothing, the city seemed virtually untouched by the 20th century. The
buildings lining the Grande Canal, the main waterway, are all very old, painted in the soft colors of the late
1800s. There are no cars in Venice and all travel is done by foot or waterway. Adam and I hopped on a boat
headed for Rialto. the tourist section of town. We stayed in a hostel located down a narrow alleyway. From
the window of the bedroom, I could almost touch the building next to us, andI deﬁnitely had an excellent view
of what was happening in the room opposite ouis.

Life in Venice was laid-back and kept its own pace apart from the rest of the world. We didn’t see people
bustling here and there, late for appointments or power lunches. Service in restaurants and shops was slow, but
no one complained. Things opened around 10:00 am. or 11:00 am. and closed early. By 10:00 pm, the city
was locked up lighter than a drum. One night Adam and I did manage to ﬁnd a pub. It was an “English-style“
pub and featured bitter and beers of England, The place was crowded with young people, mostly students
studying art at thenearhy university. Which reallydidenjoy Venice. things wereso quietand so laidrback there
that l was ready to leave at the end of our short stay there. I then headed off for Eastern Europe, where things
were definitely happening! Eastern Europe and my adventures in Budapest, Prague and Warsaw will be the
focus of my next few letters. Until then, take it easy.

THOUG H train travel in Western Europe can be very frustrating due to delays, cancellations and language
