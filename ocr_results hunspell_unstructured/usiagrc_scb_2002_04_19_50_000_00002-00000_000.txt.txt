All-Campus Events chair GEOFF SWENSON ’03 announced Monday
that the ACE committee will only hold “emergency meetings" for
the rest of the year. Swenson, who said his schedule was too busy to
continue holding weekly meetings, added that he would be strictly
enforcing rules that require all—campus events to be scheduled two
weeks in advance FILMS CHAIR HILARY BOWN ‘02 reminded
stuo‘enB Monday nightthat the Forum’s new beanbag chairs shouldn’t
be taken outside. ”Once they’re dirty, theyre dirty forever,” she said.
After a wave of thefts, the college is considering placing cages
around CONDOM DISPENSERS and possibly moving Younker's
embattled machine to a more public location than the laundry room.
Dining Services Director Dick Williams said this week that
REPLACING FLATWARE AND CHINA stolen from the dining halls
costs the college between $10,000 and $12,000 per year. Next
week, the Dining Services ofﬁce will begin asking returning students
to CHOOSE THEIR MEAL PLANS for next semester by going to
www.9rinnelldr‘ning.c0m. Students can nominate FAVORITE
PROFESSDRS for honors from the Grinnell Area Chamber of Commerce.
Forms can be picked up in the SGA ofﬁces in the Forum basement.
