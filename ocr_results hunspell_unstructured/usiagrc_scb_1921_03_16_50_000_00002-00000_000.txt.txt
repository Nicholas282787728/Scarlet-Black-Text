it is probable that no one could work
with entire success alone. The first
plan can be cast aside as undesirable
for obvious reasons, mainly that it is
entirely out or date in college commun—
ities, and because college students
should learn the rudiments or self-
govcrnment. The second scheme is
out o! bunnohy with the dual system
of men’s and women's affairs on
which this college is organized. The
third system become: somewhat more
possible, but as it stands in not en—

ganization into dormitory individual

The fourth and filth plans taken
together would form a model govern-
ment under certain conditions, es-
pecially for the dormitory group.

Grinnell student administration
distinctly divided into three groups,
co~ed interests, centering around the
Quadrangle, the men's interests, cen~
tering around life at the dormitories,
and the general campus interests, in-
volving classroom and other activities
in which both men and Women stud-
ents participate alike.

These three divisions should
kept apart, ps tar as any attempt to
build up a new form of government is
concerned. The situation at the darn
