Concert Singer

Former Trojan
Varsity Cridder

Engineering student at the Univcr.
sity of Southenl California, varsity
iootbali player, member of the glee
club and campus dramatic organiza—
lions, those were the cxpericnccs
which, in the case of Mario Chamlce
(family name Chollnondely) who is
to give a song rccital Thursday, were
the prelude to a distinguished career
as an operatic and concert singer.

While he was in college his talent
as a singer became evident, and he had
the advantage of excellent instruction.
The World War interrupted his study
of singing, but he was a rncmber of
a 'cornpany of soldicr.eirtertaincrs
which was greatly in demand in
France until long after the armistice.

Rotul'ning to America he took up
training for on operatic career in
eanrcst, and became successively a
principal tenor with the San Francisco
opera under Scotti, the Ravinia sum.
nrer opera in Chicago, and the Metro-
politan opera. Critics have given him
the highest recognition, and have even
gone so far as to compare his voice
with Caruso's.

“The program which Mr, Chamlee
has prepared for presentation Dec. 13
reveals a comprehensiveness of taste
which is rare in tenors whose pri.
mary interest is in operatic airs,” stat.
as H. W, Matiadc, music critic for The
Scarlet and Black. In addition to
two modern arias, from Pagliacci and
Cannon, his program contains several
songs from the “Poets Love" series
by Schumann, a song by Brahms, and
a number of French and English songs.
He, will also give, as his opening
group, three lime airs from the primi-
tive operatic attempts of the early 17
the century by Peri and Scarlatti.

This will be the third in the pres.
ent series of anisls' lvsdtals, and the
customary plan of admission by sem-
ester tickets and. season tickets will
prevail. Single admissions will be on
sale at the door.

Dr. Norris to Go
Fishing for Sharks

(Continued From Page 1)

research workers have been forced lo
work are abnormal. If he can detin.
itely establish character'stits of a nor—
mal gland, that will at least give a
starting point for luturc research, he
explains.

Dr. Norris has received specimens of
sharks’ pituitary glands from all over
the world. As it is so difficult, though,
to dissect the glands without injurying
them, few of the specimens have
reached him in an undamaged condi~
tion. During his trip this winter, Dr.
Norris will do the dissecting himself
and will be assqu of a number of
undamaged glands properly preserved,
with which he can continue his re.
search.

Shark Glands Better

The shark glands are better for his
work, Dr. Norris states, since most
of the research will involve a third
lobe of the gland, which in mammals
has almost disappeared, The shark pro.
vides larger glands than dogs, rats
or guinea pigs, and since it is a prim-
itive form of lite, the third lobe is still
well developed. Dr. Norris hopes to
discover characteristics and if possible
the functions of the three distinct
lobes.

He will be assisted in his work by
Lyle E. Bamber of Galeshurg, lll.,
who preceded Miss Amy E. Blagg as
assistant‘protessor of zoology at Grin-
nell. Since 1929 Mr. Bamber has been
affiliated with the Illinois Natural His—
tory Survey.
