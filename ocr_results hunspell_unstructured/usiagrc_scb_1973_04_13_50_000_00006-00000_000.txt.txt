The worst Apt-l1 snowstorm to hit low
since the National Weather Service has
kept records struck Gi‘inneii early Mons
day morning, completely paralyzmg both
the college and the town.

Although classes ran on a voluntary basis
hoth Monday and Tuesday, many students
and prolossors living away train the campus
were locked in their rooms by drills up
to fifteen feet high.

Some essential college stail members get
to and trout their jobs in foui‘»wileel-drive
vehicles, and a tew stayed on-campus
Monday night because oi ttie storm,

Some residents oi Norris Hall took ads
vantage of me huge drifts in front of the
building tor an impromptu “driIt jumping
contest”.

A number of students took stranded motorr
istS into their oil-campus apartments Mon-
day night, and the College donated blankets
to the relief eiiurt.

Highways in and out Ditne city were blocked
tor more than thirty hours, leaving Grinnell
without mail or newspaper service tor more
than two days.

McNaily’s, the Grinnell symbol ot 24 hour
service, was lorced to close Monday evenr
ing by the storm, leaving Gt‘innellians with
the “munchies" no choice but an impromptu
diet.

The College escaped with only one broken
window and a few bruised students, but the
downtown business district was not so lore
tunate W tile storm caused the root of
Wayne’s Steak House to collapse, closing
the restaurant for "an indeﬁnite length
at time”.
