South-divisionfoesMonmouth.
Coe, Cornell and Grinnell have had
a ﬁrm grip on the track title over the
last few years. In 1989 St. Norbert
was the last team from the north to
ﬁnish in the top three. “We‘ll get a
good look at the two powers, Coe
and Monouth, but this meet is not a
high priority," said Freeman.

Last Saturday the Pioneers
hosted Central and Graceland in a
non-scoring triangular meet. Run
on Grinnell’s newly surfacedindoor
track, it was the team's first home
indoor meet in a number of years.
Freemannoted,“Themeetwentwell,
andl was pleased with the competi-
tion. We thought the track would be
slow and Saturday’s results verified
that.“

The strongest event for the Pio-
neers was the pole vault. Tom
Nuzum placed second with a jump

of 14', Jeff Root was third at 13' 6"

Tony Perez went 42' 2 3/4" in
the triple jump to place second. Freer
man noted that thejunior had a few
longer leaps but he scratched. Acv

McGary showed great promise in
the long jump as did shot putters
Victor Comejo and Thad Lesiak.

Hurdlers Rob Yamachika and
Mark Schliekelman placed second
and third in the 55M highs.
Yamachika posted an 8.15 while
Schliekelman went 8.22. “We are

injury, we‘ll have three good run—
ners," said Freeman.

Middle distancemen Josh Ward
and Scott Newstrom placed first and
second in the 800M and 600M, re
spectively. Ward ran a 2:04 while
