Saga employees Carol Meredith
and Wanda Nett prepare cookies,
bread, and other baked goods on a
daily basis in the basement bakery
beneath Quad kitchen,

From 6 am. until 2 pm, these
V crienced bakers are at work.
Or a typical day. they produce a
h‘dred dozen cookies, thirty to
forty loaves of bread, and six
hundred servings of cake—enough
fg diners at both Quad and
Cowles.

The two bakers, who decide what
types oi cookies and cake will be
made each day, strive for as much
variety as possible. Meredith
stated that ”about half is made
from mixes and half from
scratch.” She added that all goods
are served the same day they are
made, and any leftovers are
quickly consumed at the next
meal. ‘

‘Bill Schuster, Quad manager for
a year and a halt.,said that neither

Meredith nor Neff belong to a
union. However, it is official Saga
policy to extend the same benefits
enjoyed by B at G workers,
members of Teamsters Union 90
Group insurance, sick pay,
vacations with pay, pension
provisions, and an annual raise are
offered. Both bakers indicated that
they are highly satisfied with their
present circumstances and have no
desire to join any union.

According to Neff, both she and
Meredith abide by the state health
regulations. For instance, they
wear hairnets, immaculate
uniforms, and refrain froln
smoking while baking. Work
areas and utensils are very clean.

Schuster added that all food
preparation areas are inspected “a
couple oi times a year." The most
recent inspection was conducted in
January. The results, overall, were
“very good,” said Schuster. He
noted that the inspector was quite
“surprised at how clean the
bakeshop is.”

At Ba.m.. the radio in the kitchen
at Quad is blaring out Glen

cafeteria manager on South
Campus. I am a relative
latecomer. having entered Quad at
7:15 to observe Saga operations for
the day

When I arrive at Quad, l have
coffee with Bill Schuster He shows
me the official Saga list ot recipes,
which has 360 items in different
categories. such as meats,
vegetables, cookies, beverages
and desserts. The kitchen has a file
box of these recipies.1n addition to
the official recipe file, Scliuster has
his own recipe box for vegetarian
dishes that he has tried or will try,
in order to add to the variety for
vegetarians. Next, I am shown the
menu for the week. The menus are
prepared at Saga headquarters by
dietitians, Saga Bill said.

Once the menu is planned, the
food is ordered from various
companies. ice cream, truit, milk,
and vegetables are delivered once
a week and meat is delivered twice
weekly from Cedar Rapids, How
much food will be needed is figured
from experience; Schuster keeps
track of how many people are at
each meal and how much food is
left over and tries to adjust
amounts accordingly. so that there
will be less waste.

Students consume an amazing
amount of iced: for an average
breakfast at Quad, so dozen eggs
and 360 pancakes. At lunch, Quad
usually handles 400450 students,
and makes about 5th servings to
teed them all. Sloppy .ioes tor
lunch require about so pounds of
ground beef and 20 packages of
hamburger buns (12 buns to a
package), and this is just one of
three entrees!

Schuster then shows me around
the basement storage rooms,
There is a dry storage room with
items such as six pound jars of
peanut butter and one pound cans
of basil leaves sitting on the
shelves, Nearby, there is a big
cooler with four doors in which
meats, vegetables. fruits. and
desserts are stored. Leftovers are
also kept in the cooler, but these
are usually used within 24 hours
and always used within «18 hours

Schuster leaves me in the kite
chen since today is his inventory
day. I go stand in aicorner of the
kitchen, somewhat awed by how
busy everyone is. One woman is
washing tomatoes, slicing them.
and arranging them on trays. while
another is cracking what looks like
a hundred eggs. two at a time into a
bowl, A third woman is cooking
scrambled eggs and a fourth is
adding dressing to coleslaw.
Finally. I get up enough courage to
walk up to one oi the women

Dorothy is the name oi the lady
slicing tomatoes, who is very
friendly and very efficient. She has
been doing salads for Saga for four

because Dorothy can pee] 10
carrots to my one, The peels fly
from her carrots as though the
carrots are exploding, while my
carrots put up a good fight to keep
their peels.

It is still breakfast time, but the
last oi the scrambled ,eggs are
being made. and lunch is well
underway. Mary Beth is making
beefpies, having already made the
batter for 150 omelets. She is
moving as smoothly and eiiiciently
as everyone else. When she puts
four beet pies, each enough to
serve twentyefive, into the oven, we
take a coffee break,

We go into the dining room and
drink juice or Coffee, and talk
quietly about the Olympic ice
dancing the night before. pie
recipes, and the price of gas and
electricity. After a short break,
lunch time preparation goes on
in earnest. Margaret is frying
hamburgers madly, while Mary
Beth is pouring out, folding. and
turning omelets on the grill.

We eat lunch from about 10:45 to
11 100‘ When students Start filing in,
we head back to the kitchen.

dishwasher have just started their
shifts.

At 12:20, everyone is still very
busy. Dorothy has gone to the
basement to make Jello, and
everyone else is starting dinner:
slicing onions, cabbage, making
batter for fried chicken, making
vegetable pie. After another short
break, 1 leave about 3 pm, just
before Dorothy's. Mary Beth's,
Jolene's, and Margaret‘s shifts
end.

The day has gone by quickly and
pleasantly, although I am
exhausted from just watching how
busy the cooks were. The at-
mosphere in the kitchen was
homey: a cool breeze blew in
through the open window while the
women worked, and occasionally
talked about children and school
and diets. Everyone was so
firendly to me that I didn't feel
uncomfortable, although I'm sure I
was in the way, After all, if you had
