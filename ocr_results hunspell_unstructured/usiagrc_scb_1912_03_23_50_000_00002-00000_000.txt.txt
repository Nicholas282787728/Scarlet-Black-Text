PROFESSOR SMILEY GIVES
EXCELLENT CHAPEL TALK

lndicts Public School System and
Urges Students to Use Inﬂuence
In Remedying Trouble

Professor C. N, Smiley addressed
Friday morning chapel with a talk
upon the public school system of thc
West.

The ﬁrst point or Mr. Smiley's
speech was devoted to showing what
miserably low salaries the high school
teachers in the central west receive. As
a result ol these low wages, three rin-
tavorahlo conditions exist: Tcache
regard their profession as merely .i
stenhingstone and not air end in itself.
Second, there can be no continuity or
instruction hemuse teachers can irot
ntioid to prepare themselves in tlic
silhycets, silth ns i01'Clgu language. and
their teach at the low scale of wages
paid in the common schools, Third.

in conclusion, Professor Smile rid
that there was no ﬁeld at work which
otter-ed greater opportunities for genu~

 

ness.

ilie service to the republic, hut in order

hioi- more teachers or capability to enter
the prolession, the \raga must he
raised, and college graduates ought to
use their influence toward this end.
