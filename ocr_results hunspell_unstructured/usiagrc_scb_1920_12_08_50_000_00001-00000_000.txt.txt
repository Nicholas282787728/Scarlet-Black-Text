Lute Discoveries

The statement has been made that
all the mathematics the human race
can ever use has already been discov-
ered or deduced, This was shown to
be erroneous, since greater strides
have been made since 1900 than ever
before, in fact, about oneequsrter as
much mathematics has been produced
Isiuce 1900 as in the 1000 years prce
vious to 1000.

Voluntary Response til-rut

The drive was presented to iltcm~
hers oi the senior class last Week, and
voluntary response by students, who
are oiferiug thcir time and effort, has
been great, Already several benefit
performances have been planned, and
student committees are active in pro-
paration for what is expected to be
one. of the most unique student body
mass meetings in the history of the
school.

Plans for directing the campus
work are not complete. Rudolph

of the committee chosen at the senior
dinner last h-itlay and will direct

ment ii'ind, and at regular intervals the
funds will be turned over by this com—
mittee to the college endowment fund
office. Virginia siveney has been ap-
pointed treasurer, and Miriam Francis
secretary of the committee,

Muss Meetings Oiteil

Mass meetings and general organi-
zation oi the campus is expected soon,
according to committee workers.
Committee appointments have not
been Completed yet, but will be ready
to announce by the end of the week.
Already the committee has had two
meetings, and has outlined plans for
the winter campaign meetings of
heads oi campus organizations are to
be called lloxL week, where plans tor
the cooperation of the several organ-
rzntions will be discussed.

Many student organizations have
offered theii services for mass meet—
rngs, and that the drive is to OIItI'ZIlIk
any other undertaking on the campus,
is already evident. Oiicrs are being
received from societies to turn over
proceeds from plays. and talk of
abandoning several unnecessary ex-
travagances in let or of the drive has
been current since the Senior meeting
Friday.

Seriousness Griltiiyll ,
“The air of seriousness w b which
the campus in general is viewing the
situation is toast gratityipg", was the
-remark of local ofiices of tho endows
rncnt campaign, now known officially
as the Griunell Movement. "For a
time the student body and community
in general did not seem to realize the
immediate necessity of action, but the
suddcnness with which the facts
struck them, and their quick action
in joining the big undertaking shows
a remarkable return of the student'
enthusiasm ot pie-war days."

PREXY TO GET CHRIST-
MAS PRESENT FROM WOMEN
LOOK FOR MONEY BOXl

A Christmas present for
what shall it be?

A box is to be placed in the lobby
outside of the dining room at the quad
wherein all women will put their-
spare coins to make up c gift to the
endowment tund. This was decided
upon by the women’s committee of the
Student endowment committee as the
best way to help and give “Prexy” the
thing he most wanted for Christmas
